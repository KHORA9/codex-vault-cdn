Young,\r\n\r\nAuthor of \"Science of Government,\" \"First Lessons in Civil Government,\"\r\n\"American Statesman,\" \"Citizen's Manual of Government and Law.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW-YORK:\r\nJ. C. DERBY & N. C. MILLER,\r\n5 SPRUCE STREET, TRIBUNE BUILDINGS.\r\n1865.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEntered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1859, by Andrew W.\r\nYoung, in the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United States\r\nfor the Northern District of New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe utility of the diffusion of political knowledge among a people\r\nexercising the right of self-government, is universally admitted. The\r\nform of government established by the people of the United States,\r\nthough well adapted to promote the general welfare, is highly\r\ncomplicated; and the knowledge requisite to administer it successfully\r\ncan not be acquired without much study. From the fact that a large\r\nportion of the American people are greatly deficient in this knowledge,\r\nwe may justly conclude that it will never become general, until it shall\r\nhave been made an object of school instruction.\r\n\r\nThe administration of the government of this great and rapidly\r\nincreasing republic, will, in a few years, devolve upon those who are\r\nnow receiving instruction in the public schools. Yet thousands annually\r\ncomplete their school education, who have never devoted any time to the\r\nstudy of the principles of the government in which they are soon to take\r\na part--who become invested with political power without the preparation\r\nnecessary to exercise it with discretion. The schools are regarded as\r\nthe nurseries of our future statesmen. They share largely in the bounty\r\nof the state; yet few of them render in return even the rudiments of\r\npolitical science to those who are to become her legislators, and\r\ngovernors, and judges. Not only in the common schools generally, but in\r\na large portion of the high schools and seminaries, this science is not\r\nincluded in the course of instruction.\r\n\r\nTo many of the most enlightened friends of education and of our free\r\ninstitutions, it has long been a matter of surprise as well as regret,\r\nthat those to whom the educational interests of the states are more\r\nimmediately intrusted, should so long have treated the study in question\r\nas of minor importance, or have suffered it to be excluded by studies of\r\nfar less practical utility. The Regents of the University of the State\r\nof New York have repeatedly noticed the neglect of this study in the\r\nacademies and seminaries subject to their visitation; and they mention\r\nit as a remarkable fact, that in many of them preference is given to the\r\nstudy of the Grecian and Roman antiquities. They say: \"The\r\nconstitutions, laws, manners, and customs of ancient Greece and Rome are\r\nmade subjects of regular study, quarter after quarter, while our own\r\nconstitutional jurisprudence, and the every day occurring principles of\r\nour civil jurisprudence, are not admitted as a part of the academic\r\ncourse!\"\r\n\r\nTo persons who are to engage in any of the industrial or professional\r\npursuits, a preparatory course of training or discipline is deemed\r\nindispensable to success. Yet many assume the weighty responsibilities\r\nof freemen, and allow their sons to do the same, with scarcely any\r\nknowledge of a freeman's duties. On the intelligent exercise of\r\npolitical power, the public prosperity and the security of our liberties\r\nmainly depend. Every person, therefore, who is entitled to the rights of\r\na citizen, is justly held responsible for the proper performance of his\r\npolitical duties. And any course of popular instruction which fails to\r\nimpart a knowledge of our system of government, must be materially\r\ndefective.\r\n\r\nWith a view to supply this deficiency, the author, many years since,\r\nprepared his \"Introduction to the Science of Government.\" This work soon\r\nattained considerable popularity, both as a class book in schools, and\r\nas a book for private reading and reference for adults. Not being\r\ndeemed, however, sufficiently _elementary_ for the children and youth\r\nin most of our common schools, another work, entitled, \"_First Lessons\r\nin Civil Government_,\" was written to meet the capacities of younger or\r\nless advanced scholars than those for whom the previous work was\r\ndesigned.\r\n\r\nThe favorable reception of these works by the public, and the assurances\r\nof their usefulness to thousands who have studied them, are to the\r\nauthor a source of high gratification, and an ample reward for many\r\nyears of arduous labor. The value of these works has, however, been in a\r\nmeasure impaired by changes in the government and laws since the time of\r\ntheir first publication. The latter, especially, descending so minutely\r\ninto the details of the government of the state for which alone it is\r\nintended, requires frequent revisions.\r\n\r\nIt has occurred to the author that a new work, more permanent in the\r\ncharacter of its matter, and adapted for use in all the states, is\r\ndemanded to supply the deficiency in the present course of education.\r\nStimulated by a desire to bear some part in laying a solid foundation\r\nfor our republican institutions, and encouraged by the success of his\r\nformer labors in this department of education, he has, after a\r\nsuspension of several years, resumed his efforts in this enterprise, in\r\nthe hope that, with the coöperation of teachers, and those having\r\nofficial supervision of the schools, it may be carried forward to an\r\nearly consummation; when the principles of government shall be made a\r\nsubject of regular study in the schools, and the elements of a sound\r\npolitical education shall be accessible to the mass of American youth.\r\nAnd he flatters himself, that the attention he has given to this subject\r\nhas enabled him to prepare a work adapted, in a good degree, to meet the\r\nexisting want of the schools.\r\n\r\nMany words and phrases, as they occur in the course of the work, have\r\nbeen defined; and an attempt has been made to explain the several\r\nsubjects in such a manner as to render them intelligible to youth.\r\n\r\nThe object which it is the purpose of this work to aid in effecting,\r\nclaims the earnest attention of parents. Every father, at least, is\r\nbound to see that his sons have the means of acquiring a good political\r\neducation. He can not innocently suffer them to pass from under his\r\nguardianship unprepared to discharge their political duties.\r\n\r\nThe study of this work should not be confined to male pupils. It has\r\nlong been considered a striking defect in our system of education, that\r\nfemales are not more generally instructed in the principles of civil\r\ngovernment, and in matters of business. Although they take no active\r\npart in public affairs, the knowledge here commended would enable them\r\nto exert a far more powerful and salutary influence upon our national\r\ncharacter and destiny. As wives, mothers, teachers, and especially as\r\ncounselors of the other sex, they could apply this knowledge to valuable\r\npurposes. And the question is submitted, whether it would not contribute\r\nmore to their usefulness than some of those accomplishments which form\r\nso large a part of a modern female education, and which are usually lost\r\namidst the cares of married life.\r\n\r\nTo preserve and transmit the blessings of constitutional liberty, we\r\nneed a healthful patriotism. But a genuine love of country is hardly to\r\nbe expected where there is not a proper appreciation of our political\r\ninstitutions, which give it its preeminence among nations. And how can\r\nthey be duly appreciated if they are not understood? It has been one of\r\nthe objects of the writer to bring to view the chief excellencies of our\r\nsystem of government, and thus to lay, in the minds of youth, the basis\r\nof an enlightened and conservative patriotism.\r\n\r\nThat this work, as an elementary treatise on civil government, is not\r\nsusceptible of improvement, is not pretended. Such as it is, it is\r\nsubmitted to the judgment of a candid public. If it shall prove in any\r\nconsiderable degree useful, the author's highest expectations will have\r\nbeen realized.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the meritorious, though often undervalued labors of the instructors\r\nof American youth, is our country greatly indebted for the successful\r\nworking of its system of free government; and upon the labors of their\r\nsuccessors rest, in an equal degree, all well-founded hopes of its\r\nfuture political prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe general introduction and profitable study of this work, depend much\r\nupon a hearty and active coöperation of teachers in the enterprise which\r\nit is intended to promote. From all who desire to make themselves in the\r\nhighest degree useful in their profession, such coöperation is\r\nconfidently anticipated.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of instructing a class in civil government, is not\r\nconfined to the pupils. The teacher will find the exercise both\r\ninteresting and profitable to himself. Although pains have been taken to\r\nadapt the work to the capacities of youth, the definition of many terms\r\nand phrases, and the further explanation of many subjects, have\r\nnecessarily been left to be supplied by teachers. The study and\r\ninvestigation which may in some cases be required to qualify them for\r\nthe task, will be amply rewarded by their own advancement in political\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nNo intelligent teacher, it is presumed, will object to the introduction\r\nof this study, on the ground that there is not sufficient time or room\r\nfor an additional exercise. Useful as all the branches now taught may be\r\njustly deemed, all of them are not, as is a knowledge of government,\r\nindispensable to the security of our liberties. The latter is of far\r\ngreater importance to an American citizen, than a knowledge of some\r\nportions of arithmetic and the higher mathematics; and in the opinion of\r\nsome distinguished educators the time now devoted to these, in many\r\nschools, is sufficient to acquire a tolerable political education. It is\r\nbelieved, however, that this study need not exclude, or essentially\r\ninterfere with, any of the studies pursued in the schools generally. By\r\nthe more advanced scholars in the common schools, the work may be used\r\nas a reading book, and thus a two-fold advantage be gained from its use.\r\n\r\nTo assist the more inexperienced teachers in conducting the exercise, a\r\nfew questions have been appended to the chapters. Questions may be added\r\nby the teachers at pleasure, or to such extent as may be thought\r\nnecessary. And it is believed the recitations may be made more\r\nprofitable to pupils, by requiring them, so far as may be, to give\r\nanswers in their own words. To some of the printed questions, no answers\r\nare furnished by the chapters and sections referred to, but may be found\r\nin the Synopsis of the State Constitutions, or other parts of the work.\r\nOccasionally questions have been inserted to which no part of the work\r\nfurnishes the answers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContents\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrinciples of Government.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I.\r\n\r\n     Mankind fitted for Society, and for Civil Government and Laws\r\n\r\nChapter II.\r\n\r\n     Rights and Liberty, defined\r\n\r\nChapter III.\r\n\r\n     Laws defined\r\n\r\nChapter IV.\r\n\r\n     Different Forms of Government.

Mankind are social beings. They are by nature fitted for society. By\r\nthis we mean that they are naturally disposed to associate with each\r\nother. Indeed, such is their nature, that they could not be happy\r\nwithout such association. Hence we conclude that the Creator has\r\ndesigned men for society. It can not, therefore, be true, as some say,\r\nthat the savage state is the natural state of man.\r\n\r\n§2. Man is so formed that he is dependent upon his fellow men. He has\r\nnot the natural strength of other animals. He needs the assistance of\r\ncreatures like himself to protect and preserve his own being. We can\r\nhardly imagine how a person could procure the necessaries of life\r\nwithout such assistance. But men have the gifts of reason and speech. By\r\nconversation they are enabled to improve their reason and increase their\r\nknowledge, and to find methods of supplying their wants, and of\r\nimproving their social condition.\r\n\r\n§3. But, although men need the assistance of each other, they are so\r\nformed that each must have the care of himself. If every man were fed\r\nand clothed from a common store, provided by the labor of all, many,\r\ndepending upon the labor of others, would be less industrious than they\r\nnow are. By the present arrangement in society, which obliges every man\r\nto provide for his own wants, more is earned, a greater number are cared\r\nfor, and the general welfare is better promoted than would be done if\r\neach labored for the benefit of all.\r\n\r\n\r\n§4. From this arrangement comes the right of property. If each man's\r\nearnings should go into a common stock for the use of all, there would\r\nbe nothing that any one could call his own. But if each is to provide\r\nfor himself, he must have a right to use and enjoy the fruits of his own\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\n§5. But all men in society have the same rights. Therefore, in laboring\r\nto supply our wants, and to gratify our desires, we can not rightfully\r\ndo so any further than is consistent with the rights of others. Hence we\r\nsee the necessity of some established rules for securing to every member\r\nof society the free enjoyment of what justly belongs to him, and for\r\nregulating his conduct toward his fellow-members.\r\n\r\n§6. These rules for regulating the social actions of men, are called\r\nlaws. _Law_, in a general sense, is a rule of action, and is applied to\r\nall kinds of action. But in its limited and proper sense, it denotes the\r\nrules of human action prescribing what men are to do, and forbidding\r\nwhat they are not to do.\r\n\r\n§7. We have seen that man is fitted for society, and that laws are\r\nnecessary to govern the conduct of men in the social state. We see also\r\nthat mankind are fitted by nature for government and laws. Man is also a\r\nmoral being. The word _moral_ has various significations. Sometimes it\r\nmeans only virtuous, or just; as, a moral man; that is, a man of moral\r\ncharacter, or who lives a moral life; by which is meant that the conduct\r\nof the man is just and right.\r\n\r\n§8. But in a wider sense, the word moral relates to the social actions\r\nof men, both right and wrong. Thus, in speaking of the character of a\r\nman, we say, his morals are good, or his morals are bad. And of an\r\naction, we say, it is morally right, or it is morally wrong. Man's\r\nhaving a moral nature implies that he has a sense of right and wrong, or\r\nat least the power or faculty of acquiring it; and, being a moral agent,\r\nhe is accountable for his actions.\r\n\r\n§9. Thus we have seen that men are social, reasonable, and moral beings.\r\nThey have power to discern their own wants and the wants of their fellow\r\nmen; to perceive what is right and what is wrong; and to know that they\r\nought to do what is right and to forbear to do what is wrong. Their\r\nreason enables them to understand the meaning of laws, and to discover\r\nwhat laws are necessary to regulate the social actions of men. Hence we\r\nconclude that they are fitted and designed for society, and for\r\ngovernment and law.\r\n\r\n§10. The youngest reader probably knows, that in speaking of society, we\r\ndo not refer to any of those associations usually called societies, but\r\nto _civil_ society, composed of the people of a state or nation. A\r\n_nation_, or _state_, is a large number of persons united under some\r\nform of government; as, the French nation; the British nation; or the\r\nstate of New-York; the state of Virginia. Sometimes it signifies the\r\nruling or governing power of a state or nation, as, the state has\r\nprovided for educating its citizens, and for supporting the poor.\r\n\r\n§11. The object of the people in forming a state association, or, as is\r\nsometimes said, of entering into civil society, is to promote their\r\nmutual safety and happiness. In uniting for this purpose, they agree to\r\nbe governed by certain established rules and principles; and the\r\ngoverning of the people of a state or nation according to these rules,\r\nis called _civil government_. The word _government_ also signifies the\r\nrules and principles themselves by which the people are governed; and\r\nsometimes the persons who administer the government--that is those who\r\nmake the laws of a state and carry them into effect--are called _the\r\ngovernment_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II.\r\n\r\nRights and Liberty, defined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. We have spoken of the rights of men, and of laws as designed to\r\nsecure to men the free enjoyment of their rights. But a more particular\r\ndefinition of rights and laws will be useful to young persons just\r\ncommencing the study of civil government.\r\n\r\n§2. A _right_ means ownership, or the just claim or lawful title which a\r\nperson has to anything. What we have acquired by honest labor, or other\r\nlawful means, is rightfully our own; and we are justly entitled to the\r\nfree use and enjoyment of it. We have a right also to be free in our\r\nactions. We may go where we please, and do what ever we think necessary\r\nfor our own safety and happiness; provided we do not trespass upon the\r\nrights of others; for it must be remembered that others have the same\r\nrights as ourselves.\r\n\r\n§3. The rights here mentioned are _natural_ rights. They are so called\r\nbecause they are ours by nature or by birth; and they can not be justly\r\ntaken from us or alienated. Hence they are also called _inalienable_. We\r\nmay, however, forfeit them by some offense or crime. If, for example, a\r\nman is fined for breaking a law, he loses his right to the money he is\r\nobliged to pay. By stealing, he forfeits his liberty, and may be justly\r\nimprisoned. By committing murder, he forfeits his right to life, and may\r\nbe hanged.\r\n\r\n§4. Rights are also called personal, political, civil, and religious.\r\n_Personal rights_, or the _rights of persons_, are rights belonging to\r\npersons as individuals, and consist of the right of _personal security_,\r\nor the right to be secure from injury to our bodies, or persons, or our\r\ngood names; the right of _personal liberty_, or the liberty of moving,\r\nacting, or speaking without unjust restraint; and the _right of\r\nproperty_, or the right to acquire and enjoy property. The terms\r\n_rights of person_ and _rights of persons_, or _personal rights_, have\r\nnot the same meaning. The rights of person, as the term is generally\r\nused, does not include the right of property; personal rights include\r\nboth the right of property and the rights of person.\r\n\r\n§5. _Political rights_ are those which belong to the people in their\r\npolitical capacity. The word _political_, in a general sense, relates to\r\ngovernment. The whole body of the people united under one government, is\r\ncalled the political body, or body politic. The right of the people to\r\nchoose and establish for themselves a form of government, or\r\nconstitution, and the right to elect persons to make and execute the\r\nlaws, are political rights. The right of voting at elections is\r\ntherefore a political right.\r\n\r\n§6. _Civil rights_ are those which are secured to the citizens by the\r\nlaws of the state. Some make no distinction between civil rights and\r\npolitical rights. In a proper sense--that in which the terms are here\r\nused--there is this difference: political rights are those secured by\r\nthe political or fundamental law, called the constitution; civil rights\r\nare more properly those which are secured by the civil or municipal\r\nlaws. The difference will more clearly appear from the definition\r\nelsewhere given of the political and civil laws. (Chap. III. §5, 6.)\r\n\r\n§7. _Religious rights_ consist in the right of a man to make known and\r\nmaintain his religious opinions, and to worship God in that way and\r\nmanner which he believes in his conscience to be most acceptable to his\r\nMaker. This right is called also the _right of conscience_. But in\r\nexercising this right, a man may not abuse it by violating the rights of\r\nothers, or disturbing the peace and order of society.\r\n\r\n§8. Now, although human rights are thus divided into classes and\r\ndifferently defined, they are all natural rights. It is generally held\r\nin this country as a truth, that \"all men are created equal;\" that is,\r\nborn with the same rights. And if men, as social and moral beings, are\r\nfitted by _nature_ and designed for government and laws, we conclude\r\nthat their political, civil, and religious rights, and all other rights\r\nto which they are entitled by the law of nature, are natural rights.\r\n\r\n§9. _Liberty_ is the being free to exercise and enjoy our rights, and is\r\ncalled natural, political, civil, or religious, according to the\r\nparticular class of rights referred to. Thus the exercise of rights\r\nguarantied by the constitution or political law, is called political\r\nliberty. The free enjoyment of rights secured by the civil or municipal\r\nlaws, is called civil liberty. And freedom of religious opinion and\r\nworship is called religious liberty.\r\n\r\n§10. Hence liberty itself is a natural right. The words _right_ and\r\n_liberty_, however, have not the same meaning. We may have a right to a\r\nthing when we have not the liberty of using it. John has a pencil which\r\nis justly his own; but James takes it from him by force. John's liberty\r\nto enjoy the use of his pencil is lost, but his right to it remains.\r\nJames has no right to the use of the pencil, though he enjoys the use of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n§11. This example serves also to explain further the use of the\r\ndifferent terms applied to rights and liberty. John's right to his\r\npencil, being guarantied to him by the laws of civil society, is a\r\n_civil_ right. It is with equal propriety called a _natural_ right,\r\nbecause, by the law of nature, he has a right to the use of his pencil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III.\r\n\r\nLaws, defined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. Law has been briefly defined. (Chap. 1. §6.) As in the case of\r\nrights and liberty, laws are distinguished by different names; as, the\r\nlaw of nature, or natural law; the moral law; the law of revelation, or\r\nrevealed law; the political law; the civil or municipal law.\r\n\r\n§2. The _law of nature_, is of the highest possible authority, being\r\nestablished by the supreme Lawgiver himself. It is called the law of\r\nnature, because it is right in itself--right in the nature of things,\r\nand ought to be obeyed, though no positive command had ever been given\r\nto men. It is a perfect rule of right for all moral and social beings.\r\nIt is that eternal rule of right to which God himself conforms.\r\n\r\n§3. The law of nature, as a rule of human action, arises out of man's\r\nrelation to his Maker and to his fellow men. As a creature, he must be\r\nsubject to the laws of his Creator, on whom he is dependent. He is also\r\nin a measure dependent upon his fellow beings. All being created equal,\r\neach is bound by the principles of natural justice to render to others\r\nthat assistance which is necessary to make them as happy as himself, or\r\nwhich they justly owe to him in return.\r\n\r\n§4. The _moral law_ is that which prescribes to men their duties to God\r\nand to each other. As a rule of human conduct therefore, it corresponds\r\nexactly to the law of nature. The moral law is briefly expressed in the\r\ndecalogue or ten commandments, and is still more briefly summed up in\r\nthe two great commandments, to love God with all our heart and to love\r\nour neighbor as ourselves. God being its author, it is called the\r\n_divine law_; and, being found in the Holy Scriptures, in which his will\r\nis revealed to mankind, it is called the _revealed law_, or _law of\r\nrevelation_.\r\n\r\n§5. _Political law_, as has been observed, is that system or form of\r\nfundamental rules, called the constitution, by which the people in their\r\npolitical capacity, or as a body politic, agree to be governed. The\r\nnature of this law will more clearly appear from a more particular\r\ndefinition of constitution, and from a description of the manner in\r\nwhich a constitution is made. (Chap. V.)\r\n\r\n§6. The word _municipal_ was used by the Romans to designate that which\r\nrelated to a _municipium_, which was a free town, or city. The rights of\r\na citizen of such free city or town were called _municipal rights_, and\r\nits officers were called _municipal officers_. In this country, the word\r\nis not only used in this limited sense, but is extended to what\r\npertains to a state. Hence the body of laws which prescribe the duties\r\nof the citizens of a state, are called the _municipal_ or _civil law_.\r\nAnd the term is used to distinguish the laws made by the legislature, or\r\nlaw-making power of the state, from the constitution, or political law,\r\nadopted by the people in their political capacity.\r\n\r\n§7. If, as has been said, the laws of the Creator form a perfect rule of\r\nconduct for all mankind, and ought in all cases to be obeyed, then all\r\nhuman law ought to agree with the divine law. If a human law is contrary\r\nto the divine law, or if it requires us to disobey the commands of God,\r\nit is not binding, and should not be obeyed. So the Scriptures teach.\r\nThey speak approvingly of men who disobeyed human authority, and who\r\ngave as the reason, that it was their duty to obey God rather than men;\r\nand they furnish many examples of good men who submitted to severe\r\npunishment, even to death, rather than do what they knew to be contrary\r\nto the divine will.\r\n\r\n§8. But although the divine will as revealed in the Scriptures, is a\r\nperfect rule or law for all mankind, and although human laws ought to\r\nconform to the divine law, yet it would be impossible to govern the\r\npeople of a state by that law alone. The divine law is broad, and\r\ncomprehends rules to teach men their whole duty; but it does not specify\r\nevery particular act of duty. Much of it consists of general principles\r\nto which particular acts must be made to conform. It requires men to\r\ndeal justly with each other; but men do not always agree as to what is\r\nright. Human laws, therefore, become necessary to declare what shall be\r\nconsidered just and right between man and man.\r\n\r\n§9. It may be observed, further, that all the divine precepts could not\r\nbe carried into effect in civil government. They are spiritual, and\r\nreach to the thoughts and intents of the heart. They require us to love\r\nour Creator supremely, and our neighbor as ourselves; in other words, to\r\ndo to others as we would that they should do to us. But as the\r\nomniscient God only knows when men fail in these duties, no human\r\nauthority could enforce such a law. Human laws, therefore, have respect\r\nchiefly to the outward acts of men, and are designed to regulate their\r\nintercourse with each other.\r\n\r\n§10. Although the laws of the state can not compel men to fulfill the\r\ngreat law of love, it is nevertheless morally binding upon all. A\r\nperfectly holy Creator could consistently require of his moral and\r\naccountable creatures nothing less than supreme love to himself, and\r\nequal love to one another. This, as has been remarked, is in accordance\r\nwith the law of nature, which is right in the nature of things. (Chap.\r\nIII. §2, 3.)\r\n\r\n§11. While the divine law accords perfectly with the principles of\r\nnatural justice, the giving of it to mankind manifests the wisdom and\r\nbenevolence of the supreme Lawgiver. Man is so formed, that it is for\r\nhis highest happiness strictly to obey this law. The generous man, in\r\nrelieving the wants of others, contributes to his own happiness. The boy\r\nwho divides an apple with his fellow, is more happy than he would be if\r\nhe retained the whole to himself. It is generally true, that, in\r\nperforming acts of kindness and charity to others, we most effectually\r\npromote our own happiness, and feel the saying to be true, \"It is more\r\nblessed to give than to receive.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV.\r\n\r\nDifferent Forms of Government. Monarchy; Aristocracy; Democracy;\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. Governments have existed in a great variety of forms. The earliest\r\ngovernments of which we have any knowledge, are the patriarchal.\r\n_Patriarch_, from the Greek, _pater_, father, and _arkos_, chief, or\r\nhead, means the father and ruler of a family. This kind of government\r\nprevailed in the early ages of the world, and in a state of society in\r\nwhich the people dwelt together in families or tribes, and were not yet\r\nformed into states or nations. The patriarchal government existed before\r\nthe flood, and for a long period afterward. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,\r\nthe fathers of the Hebrew race, as also the sons of Jacob, the heads of\r\nthe twelve tribes, were called patriarchs.\r\n\r\n§2. After their departure from Egypt, the government of the Hebrews was\r\na _theocracy_. This word is from _theos_, God, and _kratos_, power, and\r\nsignifies a government by the immediate direction of God. The laws by\r\nwhich they were governed were given to them on Mount Sinai by God\r\nhimself, their leader and king. This theocratic form of government, with\r\nsome changes, existed until the coming of the Messiah.\r\n\r\n§3. But the forms of government which have most prevailed, are\r\ndesignated by the terms, monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy, or\r\nrepublic. These words severally indicate by what persons, and in what\r\nmanner, the governing power of a state is exercised. This power is\r\nusually called the _sovereign_, or _supreme_ power. Where kings rule,\r\nthey are called sovereign; and where the power is in the hands of the\r\npeople, the people are sovereign. In the strict sense of the term,\r\nhowever, entire sovereignty, or supreme power, exists only where power\r\nis exercised by one man, or a single body of men, uncontrolled or\r\nunrestrained by laws or by any other power. But in a more general sense,\r\nit is that power in a state which is superior to all other powers within\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\n§4. A form of government in which the supreme power is in the hands of\r\none person, is called a monarchy. The word _monarch_ is from two Greek\r\nwords, _monos_ sole or only, and _arkos_, a chief; and is a general name\r\nfor a single ruler, whether he is called king, emperor, or prince. A\r\ngovernment in which all power resides in or proceeds from one person, is\r\nan _absolute_ monarchy. If the power of the monarch is restrained by\r\nlaws or by some other power, it is called a _limited_ monarchy.\r\n\r\n§5. A monarchy is called _hereditary_ in which the throne passes from\r\nfather to son, or from the monarch to his successor, by inheritance. On\r\nthe death of a sovereign, the eldest son is usually heir to the crown;\r\nor if there is no son, it falls to the daughter, or some other relative.\r\nA monarchy is _elective_, where, on the death of the ruler, his\r\nsuccessor is appointed by an election. A few such monarchies have\r\nexisted.\r\n\r\n§6. An absolute monarchy is sometimes called _despotism_. The word\r\n_despot_ is from the Greek, and means _master_, or _lord_. It has nearly\r\nthe same meaning as _tyrant_, which also is from the Greek, and\r\nsignifies _king_. These words at first meant simply a single ruler. They\r\nare now applied, for the most part, to rulers who exercise authority\r\nover their subjects with severity. In an absolute despotism, the monarch\r\nhas entire control over his subjects. They have no law but the will of\r\nthe ruler, who has at command a large force of armed men to keep his\r\npeople in subjection. The governments of Russia and Turkey are highly\r\ndespotic.\r\n\r\n§7. An _aristocracy_ is a form of government in which the power is\r\nexercised by a privileged order of men, distinguished for their rank and\r\nwealth. The word _aristocracy_ is from the Greek word _aristos_, best,\r\nand _kratos_, power, or _krateo_, to govern; and means a government of\r\nthe best. It is also used for the nobility of a country under a\r\nmonarchical government. _Nobles_ are persons of rank above the common\r\npeople, and bear some title of honor. The titles of the English nobility\r\nare those of duke, marquis, earl, viscount, and baron. These titles are\r\nhereditary, being derived from birth. In some cases they are conferred\r\nupon persons by the king.\r\n\r\n§8. A _democracy_ is a government of the people; the word democracy\r\nbeing from the Greek _demos_, the people, and _krateo_, to govern. In a\r\ngovernment purely democratic, the great body of freemen meet in one\r\nassembly to make and execute the laws. There were some such governments\r\nin ancient Greece; but they necessarily comprised small territories,\r\nscarcely more than a single town. The freemen of a state could not all\r\nmeet in a single assembly.\r\n\r\n§9. The government of this country, though a government of the people,\r\nis not one of the kind just described; it is a republic. A _republic_ is\r\na government in which the power to enact and execute the laws is\r\nexercised by representatives, who are persons elected by the people to\r\nact for them. Yet, as not only the election of representatives, but the\r\nadoption of the constitution or form of government itself is the act of\r\nthe people; and as, therefore, all power comes from the people, the\r\ngovernment is also democratic; and is properly called a _democratic\r\nrepublic_, or a _representative democracy_.\r\n\r\n§10. A republic is sometimes also called a _commonwealth_. _Common_\r\nsignifies general, and is applied to what belongs to or is used by the\r\npeople generally. _Weal_ means welfare or happiness. _Wealth_ also was\r\nformerly sometimes used for weal. Hence _commonwealth_ means strictly\r\nthe _common good_, or the _common happiness_. In a general sense it\r\nsignifies a state; but it is properly applied to a free state, one in\r\nwhich the people enjoy common rights and privileges. Hence every state\r\nin the union is a commonwealth or republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nState Governments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V.\r\n\r\nThe Nature and Objects of a Constitution, and the Manner in which it is\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. Of all the different forms of government which have existed, a\r\nrepublican government, on the plan of that which has been established in\r\nthis country, is believed to be best adapted to secure the liberties of\r\na people, and to promote the general welfare. Under the reign of a wise\r\nand virtuous ruler, the rights of person and property may be fully\r\nenjoyed, and the people may be in a good degree prosperous. But the\r\nrequisite virtue and wisdom have seldom been found in any one man or a\r\nfew men. And experience has proved that the objects of civil government\r\nmay be best secured by a written constitution founded upon the will or\r\nconsent of the people.\r\n\r\n§2. The word _constitute_ is from the Latin, and signifies _to set_, to\r\nfix, to establish. _Constitution_, when used in a political sense, means\r\nthe established form of government of a state. In a free government,\r\nlike ours, it is properly called the _political law_, being established\r\nby the people as a body politic, or political body. (Chap. III,\r\n§5.) It is also called the _fundamental law_, because it is the\r\n_foundation_ of all other laws of the state, which are enacted by the\r\nlegislature for regulating intercourse between the citizens, and are\r\ncalled the _municipal_ or _civil_ law, and must conform to the\r\nfundamental, or political law.\r\n\r\n§3. A constitution is in the nature of an agreement between a whole\r\ncommunity or body politic and each of its members. This agreement or\r\ncontract implies, that each one binds himself to the whole, and the\r\nwhole bind themselves to each one, that all shall be governed by certain\r\nlaws and regulations for the common good.\r\n\r\n§4. The nature of a constitution will further appear from the manner in\r\nwhich it is made. It is evident that a people, in establishing a\r\nconstitution, must have some right or authority to act in the business.\r\nWhence this right is derived, we will not now stop to inquire. There is,\r\nhowever, somewhere power to enact a law authorizing the people to make a\r\nconstitution and prescribing the manner in which it is to be made.\r\n\r\n§5. In forming a constitution, the people must act collectively. But\r\ntheir number is too large to meet in a single assembly. Therefore they\r\nchoose a small number to act for them. One or more are chosen in each\r\ncounty, or smaller district, and are called delegates. A _delegate_ is a\r\nperson appointed by another with power to transact business as his\r\nrepresentative. The assembly composed of the delegates so elected, is\r\ncalled _convention_; a name given to most public meetings other than\r\nlegislative assemblies. Delegate and representative are words of nearly\r\nthe same meaning. The latter, however, usually designates a person\r\nchosen to assist in making the laws of the state.\r\n\r\n§6. The rules agreed upon by the convention as a basis of government,\r\nare arranged in proper form. The several portions relating to the\r\ndifferent subjects are called articles, and numbered; and the articles\r\nare divided into sections, which also are numbered. But what has been\r\nthus prepared by the convention is not yet a constitution. It is only a\r\ndraft of one, and can not become a constitution without the consent of\r\nthe people to be given at an election. If a majority of the persons\r\nvoting at such election vote in favor of the proposed constitution, it\r\nis adopted, and becomes the constitution of the state.\r\n\r\n§7. One of the most valuable rights of the people under a free\r\ngovernment, is the right to have a constitution of their own choice.\r\nIndeed it is in this right that their freedom principally consists. It\r\nis by the constitution that their rights are secured. All the people\r\njoin in establishing the constitution; but they do not all unite in\r\nmaking and executing the laws; in other words, they do not themselves\r\nadminister the government; this is done by their representatives. But if\r\nthese should enact unjust and oppressive laws; the people, having by\r\ntheir constitution reserved the right to displace them, may do so by\r\nelecting others in their stead.\r\n\r\n§8. In an absolute monarchy the people have no political rights--the\r\nright to establish a form of government for themselves, and the right to\r\nelect those who are to make and administer the laws. The monarch has\r\nentire control over his subjects. He can take their lives and property\r\nwhen he pleases. His will is their law; and he has at command a large\r\nforce of armed men to keep his people in subjection.\r\n\r\n§9. In a limited monarchy, the people have some political rights. Such a\r\nmonarchy is Great Britain. The king or sovereign is in a measure\r\nrestrained by laws; and he can not make laws alone. The laws are framed\r\nand agreed to by parliament, and must be approved by the king or queen.\r\nParliament consists of two bodies of men, the house of lords and the\r\nhouse of commons. The members of the latter are elected by the people,\r\nwho, in such election, exercise a political right.\r\n\r\n§10. But the political right of establishing a constitution or form of\r\ngovernment, is not enjoyed by the people of that country. They have no\r\nwritten instrument, like ours, called constitution, adopted by the\r\npeople. What is there called the constitution, is the aggregate or sum\r\nof laws, principles, and customs, which have been formed in the course\r\nof centuries. There is therefore no restraint upon the power of\r\nparliament; hence no law which may be enacted is contrary to the\r\nconstitution; and the people have not the same security against the\r\nenactment of unjust laws as the people of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI.\r\n\r\nQualifications of Electors; or, by whom Political Power is exercised in\r\nthe States of this Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. One of the first provisions usually inserted in a constitution of a\r\nfree state, is that which declares who shall be allowed to take a part\r\nin the government; that is, to whom the political power shall be\r\nintrusted. As this power is exercised by voting at elections, the\r\nconstitution very properly prescribes the qualifications of electors,\r\nor, in other words, declares what shall be necessary to entitle a man to\r\nthe right of voting, or the right of suffrage. When, therefore, we speak\r\nof the people politically, we mean those only who are qualified\r\nelectors.\r\n\r\n§2. To be competent to exercise the right of suffrage, a person must be\r\na freeman, or, as we sometimes say, he should be his own master. While\r\nunder the control of a parent or guardian, he might be constrained to\r\nact contrary to his own judgment. All our state constitutions,\r\ntherefore, give this right only to free male citizens of the age of\r\ntwenty-one years and upwards; twenty-one years being the age at which\r\nyoung men become free to act for themselves.\r\n\r\n§3. But even if this freedom were obtained at an earlier age, it would\r\nnot be expedient to bestow this right upon persons so young. They have\r\nnot the necessary knowledge and judgment to act with discretion. Some\r\nare competent at an earlier age; but a constitution can make no\r\ndistinction between citizens. It has therefore, in accordance with the\r\ngeneral opinion, fixed the time at the age of twenty-one, when men shall\r\nbe deemed capable of exercising the rights and performing the duties of\r\nfreemen.\r\n\r\n§4. That a man may vote understandingly, he must have resided long\r\nenough in the state to have become acquainted with its government and\r\nlaws, and to have learned the character and qualifications of the\r\npersons for whom he votes. State constitutions therefore require, that\r\nelectors shall have resided in the state for a specified period of time,\r\nvarying, however, in the different states from three months to two\r\nyears. In most of the states, they must also have resided for some\r\nmonths in the county or district, and be residents of the town in which\r\nthey offer to vote.\r\n\r\n§5. But in giving the right of suffrage to all free male citizens\r\ntwenty-one years of age, it is not given to every _man_, because all\r\n_men_ of that age are not citizens. Persons born in foreign countries\r\nand residing here are _aliens_, and are not entitled to the political\r\nrights of persons born in this country. They are presumed to have too\r\nlittle knowledge of our government, and to feel too little interest in\r\npublic affairs, on their first coming hither, to be duly qualified for\r\nthe exercise of political power. Laws, however, have been enacted for\r\nnaturalizing aliens after they shall have resided here long enough to\r\nbecome acquainted with and attached to our government. By naturalization\r\nthey become citizens, entitled to all the privileges of native or\r\nnatural born citizens, (Chap. XXXIV, §3, 4.)\r\n\r\n§6. The constitutions of most of the states confer the rights of an\r\nelector on _white_ male citizens only. Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont,\r\nMassachusetts, and Rhode Island, are the only states in which colored\r\nmen have the same electoral rights as white citizens. In New York, men\r\nof color owning a freehold estate (an estate in lands) of the value of\r\n$250, are qualified voters.\r\n\r\n§7. It is provided also in state constitutions, that electors committing\r\ninfamous crimes are disfranchised. _Franchise_ is a right or privilege\r\nenjoyed by the citizens of a state. Hence the right of voting at\r\nelections is called the _elective franchise_; and an elector, when\r\ndeprived of this privilege, is _disfranchised_. An _infamous crime_ is\r\none which is punishable by imprisonment in a state prison. Men guilty of\r\nhigh crimes are deemed unfit to be intrusted with so important a duty as\r\nthat of electing the persons who are to make and execute the laws of the\r\nstate. It is provided, however, that if such persons are pardoned before\r\nthe expiration of the term for which they were sentenced to be\r\nimprisoned, their forfeited rights are restored.\r\n\r\n§8. By the earliest constitutions of many of the old states, electors\r\nwere required to own property, or to have paid rents or taxes, to a\r\ncertain amount. In the election of the higher officers, freeholders only\r\nwere entitled to vote. A _freeholder_ is an owner of real estate,\r\n(property in lands,) which he holds in his own right, and may transmit\r\nto his heirs. In the constitutions of the newer states, property has not\r\nbeen made a qualification of an elector; and in the amended\r\nconstitutions of the old states this restriction upon the elective\r\nfranchise has been removed, until it has nearly ceased to exist in the\r\nUnited States. It is now enjoyed by all white male freemen, with few\r\nexceptions, in almost every state of the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII.\r\n\r\nElections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. For the convenient exercise of political power, as well as for the\r\npurposes of government generally, the territory of a state is divided\r\ninto districts of small extent. It has been remarked, that the people of\r\na state, being too numerous to meet in one assembly to make laws and\r\ntransact the public business, elect a small number to represent them.\r\nBut to elect these representatives and other officers, and to adopt the\r\nconstitution, or fundamental law of the state, are political duties,\r\nwhich must be performed by the people in person, and in a _collective_\r\ncapacity. Hence the necessity of small territorial divisions, in which\r\nthe people may assemble for political purposes.\r\n\r\n§2. A state is divided into counties, and these are divided into towns\r\nor townships. The people of every county and every town have power to\r\nmanage their local concerns. The corporate powers of counties and towns,\r\nand the election and the powers and duties of county and town officers,\r\nwill be given in subsequent chapters.\r\n\r\n§3. The electors of the state meet every year in their respective towns\r\nfor the election of officers. Meetings for electing town officers are,\r\nin a majority of the states, held in the earlier part of the year. Most\r\nofficers elected by the people, other than town officers, are chosen at\r\nthe general state election, which, in most of the states, is held in\r\nOctober or November.\r\n\r\n§4. Elections are conducted by persons designated by law, or chosen by\r\nthe electors of the town for that purpose. It is their duty to preserve\r\norder, and to see that the business is properly done. They are usually\r\ncalled _judges of elections_, or _inspectors of elections_. Persons\r\nalso, (usually two,) serve as clerks. Each clerk keeps a list of the\r\nnames of the persons voting, which is called a _poll-list. Poll_, which\r\nis said to be a Saxon word, signifies _head_, and has come to mean\r\nperson. Thus, so much a head means so much for every _person_ By a\r\nfurther change it has been made to signify an election, because the\r\npersons there voting are numbered. Hence, \"going to the polls\" has\r\nobtained the same meaning as going to an election.\r\n\r\n§5. When the inspectors are ready to receive votes, one of them makes it\r\nknown by proclaiming with a loud voice, that \"the polls are now open.\"\r\nThe inspectors receive from each voter a ballot, which is a piece of\r\npaper containing the names of the persons voted for, and the title of\r\nthe office to which each of them is to be elected. _Ballot_, from the\r\nFrench, means a little ball, and is used in voting. Ballots are of\r\ndifferent colors; those of one color signifying an affirmative vote, or\r\n_yes_; those of another color a negative vote, or _no_. From this has\r\ncome the application of the word ballot to the written or printed ticket\r\nnow used in voting.\r\n\r\n§6. If no objection is made to an elector's voting, the ballot is put\r\ninto the box, and the clerks enter his name on the poll-list. If the\r\ninspectors suspect that a person offering to vote is not a qualified\r\nelector, they may question him upon his oath in respect to his\r\nqualifications as to age, the term of his residence in the state and\r\ncounty, and citizenship. Any bystander also may question his right to\r\nvote. This is called _challenging_. A person thus challenged is not\r\nallowed to vote until the challenge is withdrawn, or his qualifications\r\nare either proved by the testimony of other persons, or sworn to by\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n§7. In a few states, the voters are registered. A list is kept of the\r\nnames of all who have, upon examination, been ascertained to be\r\nqualified electors; and those only whose names are on the register are\r\nallowed to vote. Thus many interruptions to voting by the examination of\r\nvoters at the polls, and much illegal voting, are prevented. Voters in\r\nsome states are also required to take what is called the \"elector's\r\noath,\" in which they promise to be true and faithful to the state and\r\nits government, and to the constitution of the United States; and to\r\ngive their votes as they shall judge will conduce to the best good of\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\n§8. After the polls are closed, the box is opened, and the ballots are\r\ncounted. If the number of ballots agrees with the number of names on the\r\npoll-lists, it is presumed no mistake has been made, either in voting or\r\nin keeping the lists. If the election is one for the choosing of town\r\nofficers, it is there determined who are elected, and their election is\r\npublicly declared.\r\n\r\n§9. The election of county and state officers can not be determined by\r\nthe town canvassers. A statement of the votes given in each town for the\r\npersons voted for, is sent to the county canvassers, who, from the\r\nreturns of votes from all the towns, determine and declare the election\r\nof the officers chosen for the county. To determine the election of\r\nstate officers, and of such others as are elected for districts\r\ncomprising more than one county, a statement of the votes given for the\r\nseveral candidates, is sent by the several boards of county canvassers\r\nto the state canvassers, who, from the returns of votes from the several\r\ncounties, determine the election of the state officers.\r\n\r\n§10. In a few states, voting at elections is done _viva voce_. These\r\nwords mean by word of mouth. In voting in this manner, the elector\r\nspeaks the name of the person for whom he votes.\r\n\r\n§11. In most of the states, persons are elected by a plurality of votes.\r\nAn election by _plurality_ is when the person elected has received a\r\nhigher number of votes than any other, though such number be less than a\r\nmajority of all the votes given. Suppose, for example, three candidates\r\nreceive 1000 votes: One receives 450; another, 300; the third, 250\r\nvotes. The first, having the highest number, though not a majority, is\r\nelected. In the New England, or eastern states, a _majority_, that is,\r\nmore than one-half of all the votes given, is necessary to the election\r\nof many of the higher officers. The least number of votes out of 1000,\r\nby which a person can be elected by this rule, is 501.\r\n\r\n§12. Either of these modes is liable to objection. When a simple\r\nplurality effects an election, 1,000 votes may be so divided upon three\r\ncandidates as to elect one by 334 votes; or of four candidates, one may\r\nbe elected by 251 votes, and against the wishes of nearly three-fourths\r\nof the electors. An objection to the other mode is, that if no person\r\nreceives a majority of all the votes, another election must be held.\r\nNumerous trials have, in some instances, been necessary to effect a\r\nchoice; and the people of a district have remained for a time without a\r\nrepresentative in the state or national legislature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII.\r\n\r\nDivision of the Powers of Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. Having shown the nature of a constitution and the manner in which it\r\nis made and adopted, it will next be shown how the powers of government\r\nunder a state constitution are divided. As the excellence of a form of\r\ngovernment consists much in a proper separation and distribution of\r\npower, this subject deserves special attention.\r\n\r\n§2. We notice first the separation of the political and civil powers.\r\nThe words _political_ and _civil_ are often used as having the same\r\nmeaning. Thus, speaking of the system of government and laws of a\r\ncountry, we use the general term, \"political institutions,\" or \"civil\r\ninstitutions;\" either of which is deemed correct. But these words have\r\nalso a particular signification, as has already been shown in the\r\ndistinction made in preceding chapters between political rights and\r\ncivil rights, and between the political law and the municipal or civil\r\nlaws. (Chap. II, and III.) Hence it appears, that what we mean by\r\npolitical power is the power exercised by the people in their political\r\ncapacity, in adopting their constitution and electing the officers of\r\nthe government; and that, by the civil power is meant the power\r\nexercised by these officers in administering the government.\r\n\r\n§3. In an absolute government, no such distinction exists; all power is\r\ncentered in the supreme ruler. There is no political law binding on him.\r\nBeing himself restrained by no positive laws or regulations that have\r\nbeen adopted by the people, or that may be altered by them, the people\r\nhave no political rights. In a mixed government, or limited monarchy,\r\npolitical power is exercised to some extent. Although there is no\r\nwritten constitution adopted by the people, as in a republic, the\r\nmembers of one branch of the law-making power are elected by the people.\r\nIn such election they are said to exercise political power.\r\n\r\n§4. We notice next the division of the civil power. This power, in well\r\nconstructed governments, is divided into three departments, the\r\nlegislative, the executive, and the judicial. The legislative department\r\nis that by which the laws of the state are made. The legislature is\r\ncomposed of two bodies, the members of which are elected by the people.\r\nIn limited monarchies where one branch of the legislature is elective,\r\nthe other is an aristocratic body, composed of men of wealth and\r\ndignity, as the British house of lords.\r\n\r\n§5. The executive department is intrusted with the power of executing,\r\nor carrying into effect, the laws of the state. There is in this\r\ndepartment a governor, assisted by a number of other officers, some of\r\nwhom are elected by the people; others are appointed in such manner as\r\nthe constitution or laws prescribe. The powers and duties of the\r\ngovernor of a state will be more particularly described in another\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n§6. The judicial department is that by which justice is administered to\r\nthe citizens. It embraces the several courts of the state. All judges\r\nand justices of the peace are judicial officers; and they have power,\r\nand it is their business to judge of and apply the law in cases brought\r\nbefore them for trial. A more particular description of the powers and\r\nduties of judicial officers, and the manner of conducting trials in\r\ncourts of justice, will be given elsewhere. (Chap. XVII-XX.)\r\n\r\n§7. Experience has shown the propriety of dividing the civil power into\r\nthese three departments, and of confining the officers of each\r\ndepartment to the powers and duties belonging to the same. Those who\r\nmake the laws should not exercise the power of executing them; nor\r\nshould they who either make or execute the laws sit in judgment over\r\nthose who are brought before them for trial. A government in which the\r\ndifferent powers of making, executing, and applying the laws should be\r\nunited in a single body of men, however numerous, would be little better\r\nthan an absolute despotism.\r\n\r\n§8. Again, the legislative department of the civil power is divided.\r\nUnder all our state constitutions, the legislature consists of two\r\nbranches, both of which must agree to a proposed measure before it\r\nbecomes a law; and in many of the states, it must also be approved by\r\nthe governor. This is making the chief executive officer a third branch\r\nof the law-making power; and is not in accordance with the principle of\r\nkeeping the several departments of the civil power separate and distinct\r\nfrom each other. The reason for this departure from the general\r\nprinciple mentioned, will be stated in another chapter. (Chap. XI. §16.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX.\r\n\r\nState Legislatures--how constituted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. The legislature of every state in the union is composed of two\r\nhouses--a senate and a house of representatives. The latter, or, as it\r\nis sometimes called, the lower house, in the states of New York,\r\nWisconsin, and California, is called the assembly; in Maryland and\r\nVirginia, the house of delegates; in North Carolina, the house of\r\ncommons; and in New Jersey, the general assembly. In most of the\r\nstates, the two houses together are called _general assembly_.\r\n\r\n§2. The senate, as well as the other house, is a representative body;\r\nits members being elected by the people to represent them. Why, then, is\r\nonly one of the two branches called the house of representatives?\r\nPerhaps for this reason: Under the governments of the colonies, while\r\nyet subject to Great Britian, there was but one representative assembly.\r\nThe other branch of the legislature was called a _council_, consisting\r\nof a small number of men who were appointed by the king. After the\r\ncolonies became free and independent states, a senate was substituted\r\nfor the old council, and although it is an elective body, the other\r\nhouse, being much more numerous, is called, by way of distinction, the\r\n_house of representatives_.\r\n\r\n§3. Senators are chosen annually in the six New England states, namely,\r\nMaine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and\r\nConnecticut. In the other states they are elected for terms of two,\r\nthree, or four years. In most of the states in which senators are\r\nelected for longer terms than one year, they are not all elected at the\r\nsame time. They are divided into classes; and those of one class go out\r\nof office one year, and those of another class another year; so that\r\nonly a part of the senators are elected every year, or every two, or\r\nthree, or four years.\r\n\r\n§4. The senate, as distinguished from the house of representatives, is\r\nsometimes called the upper house. It was designed to be a more select\r\nbody, composed of men chosen with reference to their superior ability,\r\nor their greater experience in public affairs.\r\n\r\n§5. Senators are differently apportioned in different states. In some\r\nstates they are apportioned among the several counties, so that the\r\nnumber to be elected in each county shall be in proportion to the number\r\nof its inhabitants. In others they are elected by districts, equal in\r\nnumber to the number of senators to be chosen in the state, and a\r\nsenator is elected in each district. The districts are to contain, as\r\nnearly as may be, an equal number of inhabitants; and sometimes they\r\ncomprise several counties.\r\n\r\n§6. Representatives are apportioned among the counties in proportion to\r\nthe population in each. In some states they are elected in districts of\r\nequal population, counties being sometimes divided in the formation of\r\ndistricts. In the New England states, representatives are apportioned\r\namong the towns. In about one-half of the states, they are elected\r\nannually; in the others, (including-most of the southern and western\r\nstates,) they are elected every two years.\r\n\r\n§7. The different modes of apportioning members of the legislature have\r\nin view the same object--equal representation; that is, giving a member\r\nto the same number of inhabitants in one county or district as to an\r\nequal number in another. But in some counties the population increases\r\nmore rapidly than in others. The representation then becomes unequal,\r\nbeing no longer in proportion to population.\r\n\r\n§8. In order to keep the representation throughout the state as nearly\r\nequal as possible; in other words, to secure to the people of every\r\ncounty or district their just proportion of the representatives, the\r\nconstitution requires that, at stated times, the people of the state\r\nshall be numbered, and a new apportionment of senators and\r\nrepresentatives be made among the several counties according to the\r\nnumber of inhabitants in each county; or if the state is one in which\r\nmembers of the legislature are chosen in districts, a new division of\r\nthe state is made into districts.\r\n\r\n§9. But the periods of time between the enumerations of the people, are\r\nnot the same in all the states. In some states the enumerations are made\r\nevery ten years; in others, shorter periods have been fixed, from eight\r\ndown to four years. This enumeration or numbering of the people is\r\ncalled taking the census. _Census_ is from the Latin, and was used by\r\nthe ancient Romans to signify a declaration or statement made before the\r\ncensors by the citizens, containing an enumeration or register of\r\nthemselves, their wives, children, servants, and their property and its\r\nvaluation. In the United States, although the census sometimes includes\r\na similar register, the word usually means simply an enumeration of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n§10. The constitution also prescribes the qualifications of senators and\r\nrepresentatives. If, as qualifications for an elector, full age,\r\ncitizenship, and a considerable term of residence in the state and\r\ncounty, are properly required, as we have seen, (Chap. VI. §2-5,) they\r\nmust be at least equally necessary for those who make the laws. In no\r\nstate, therefore, are any but qualified electors eligible to the office\r\nof senator or representative. In some states, greater age and longer\r\nresidence are required; and in some, the age and term of residence have\r\nbeen still further increased in the case of senators. The property\r\nqualification formerly necessary for members of the legislature, as well\r\nas for voters, has been almost entirely abolished. (Chap. VI. §8.)\r\n\r\n§11. If a member of the legislature dies, or resigns his office before\r\nthe expiration of the term for which he was chosen, the vacancy is\r\nfilled by the election of another person at the next general election,\r\nor at a special election called for that purpose, or in such other\r\nmanner as the constitution may provide. But a person chosen to fill a\r\nvacancy, holds the office only for the remainder of the term of him\r\nwhose place he was chosen to supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X.\r\n\r\nMeetings and Organization of the Legislature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. The legislature meets as often as the constitution requires, to\r\nenact such laws as may be necessary to promote the public welfare, and\r\nto perform such other duties as are assigned to it by the constitution\r\nand the laws. In about half of the states, sessions are held annually;\r\nin the others biennially, or once in two years. A legislative session\r\nincludes the daily meetings of a legislature from the time of its first\r\nassembling, to the day of final adjournment. Thus we say the session\r\ncommenced in January and ended in March. The word _session_ has\r\nreference also to a single sitting, from the hour at which the members\r\nassemble on any day, to the time of adjournment on the same day. Thus we\r\nsay, the legislature holds a daily session of four hours; or, it holds\r\ntwo sessions a day, as the case may be.\r\n\r\n§2. Meetings of the legislature are held at a place permanently fixed by\r\nthe constitution; at which place the principal state officers keep their\r\noffices. Hence it is called the _seat of government_, or perhaps more\r\nfrequently, the _capital_ of the state. _Capital_ is from the Latin\r\n_caput_, the head, and has come to mean chief, or the highest. A capital\r\ncity is therefore the chief city of a state or kingdom. But the word\r\n_capital_, applied to a city, now generally indicates the seat of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n§3. When the two houses have assembled in their respective chambers,\r\nsome person designated for that purpose administers to the members of\r\neach house the oath of office, in which they solemnly swear (or affirm,)\r\nthat they will support the constitution of the United States, and the\r\nconstitution of the state, and faithfully discharge the duties of their\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n§4. Each house then proceeds to _organize_ for business, by appointing\r\nproper officers, and determining the right of members to seats in the\r\nhouse. In organizing a legislative body, the first thing done is the\r\nelection of a presiding officer, or chairman, who is usually called\r\n_speaker_. The lieutenant-governor, in states in which there is one,\r\npresides in the senate, and is called _president of the senate_. In the\r\nabsence of the presiding officer, a temporary speaker or president is\r\nchosen, who is called speaker or president _pro tempore_, commonly\r\nabbreviated, _pro tem._, which is a Latin phrase, meaning _for the\r\ntime_.\r\n\r\n§5. The duty of the person presiding is to keep order, and to see that\r\nthe business of the house is conducted according to certain established\r\nrules. When a vote is to be taken, he puts the question, which is done\r\nby requesting all who are in favor of a proposed measure, to say _aye_,\r\nand those opposed to say _no_. And, when a vote has been taken, he\r\ndeclares the question to be carried or lost. This part of a speaker's\r\nbusiness is similar to that of the chairman of an ordinary public\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\n§6. The other officers chosen by each house are, a _clerk_ to keep a\r\nrecord or journal of its proceedings; to take charge of papers, and to\r\nread such as are to be read to the house; and to do such other things as\r\nmay be required of him; a _sergeant-at-arms_, to arrest members and\r\nother persons guilty of disorderly conduct, to compel the attendance of\r\nabsent members, and to do other business of a like nature: also one or\r\nmore _door-keepers_. The officers mentioned in this section are not\r\nchosen from the members of the house.\r\n\r\n§7. The constitution does not prescribe to either house the order of\r\nbusiness, or the particular manner in which it shall be done; but\r\nauthorizes each house to determine for itself the rules of its\r\nproceedings. But there are sundry things which it expressly enjoins. It\r\ndetermines what portion of the members shall constitute a quorum to do\r\nbusiness. _Quorum_ is the Latin of the English words, _of whom_, and has\r\nstrangely come to signify the _number_ or _portion_ of any body of men\r\nwho have power to act for the whole. Thus with reference to a\r\nlegislative body consisting of a certain number of members, instead of\r\nsaying, A majority _quorum_ shall have power to act; or, A majority _of\r\nwhom_ shall have power to act, our constitutions generally say, A\r\nmajority shall constitute a quorum to do business. In some states, more\r\nthan a bare majority is required for a quorum.\r\n\r\n§8. Constitutions generally require also that the proceedings of\r\nlegislative bodies shall be open to public inspection. The doors may be\r\nclosed against spectators only when the public good shall require\r\nsecrecy. And that the people may be fully informed of what is done, each\r\nhouse is required to keep and publish a journal of its proceedings.\r\n\r\n§9. Provision is also made, either by the constitution or by laws\r\nagainst injury or interruption to the business of the legislature.\r\nMembers may not, by any prosecution at law, except for crimes and\r\nmisdemeanors, be hindered during their attendance at the sessions of the\r\nlegislature, nor in going to or returning from the same. Each house may\r\ncompel the attendance of absent members. It may for good cause expel a\r\nmember, and punish, not only its members and officers, but other\r\npersons, for disorderly conduct, or for obstructing its proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI.\r\n\r\nManner of Enacting Laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. When the two houses are duly organized and ready for business, the\r\ngovernor sends to both houses a written communication called _message_,\r\nin which, as the constitution requires, he gives to the legislature\r\ninformation of the condition of the affairs of the state, and recommends\r\nsuch measures as he judges necessary and expedient. The message is read\r\nto each house by its clerk.\r\n\r\n§2. But the measures to which the governor calls the attention of the\r\nlegislature, are but a small portion of those which are considered and\r\nacted upon. Many are introduced by individual members. Others are\r\nbrought into notice by the petitions of the people in different parts of\r\nthe state. _Petition_ generally signifies a request or prayer. As here\r\nused, it means a written request to the legislature for some\r\nfavor--generally for a law granting some benefit or relief to the\r\npetitioners. Petitions are sent to members, usually to those who\r\nrepresent the counties or districts in which the petitioners live, and\r\nare by these members presented to the house.\r\n\r\n§3. Now it is evident, that a proper consideration of the numerous\r\nsubjects pressed upon the attention of the legislature--some of them of\r\nvery great importance--must require much labor. If the necessary\r\ninvestigation of so many subjects should occupy the time of the whole\r\nhouse, there would not be time enough to act upon one-half of them.\r\nTherefore, in order to dispatch business, the labor of the house must be\r\ndivided, that the investigation of all the different subjects may be\r\ngoing on at the same time.\r\n\r\n§4. Hence arises the practice which prevails in all legislative bodies,\r\nof the appointment of committees. As soon as may be, after a house is\r\norganized, committees are appointed on all subjects usually acted on in\r\nthe legislature. A legislative committee is generally composed of three,\r\nfive, or seven members, who examine the subjects referred to them, and\r\nreport the result of their examination to the house. Committees are\r\nappointed by the presiding officer of each house. Occasionally, though\r\nvery rarely, they are elected by the house itself.\r\n\r\n§5. Some or all of the following committees are appointed in every\r\nlegislature: a committee on finance, or the funds, income, and other\r\nmoney matters of the state, sometimes called the committee of ways and\r\nmeans; a committee on agriculture; a committee on manufactures;\r\ncommittees on the incorporation of cities and villages; on banks and\r\ninsurance companies; on railroads; on canals; on education; on\r\nelections; on public printing, besides many others. So numerous are\r\nthese subjects, that in constituting the committees, every member may be\r\nput on some committee.\r\n\r\n§6. All matters relating to these subjects of a general nature, which\r\narise during the session, are referred to their appropriate committees.\r\nThus, a question or proposition relating to banks, is referred to the\r\ncommittee on banks; matters relating to rail-roads, are referred to the\r\ncommittee on rail-roads; those relating to schools, are referred to the\r\ncommittee on education, &c. As these committees continue during the\r\nsession, they are called _standing_ committees. When a question arises\r\nhaving no relation to any subject on which there is a standing\r\ncommittee, it is usually referred to a _special_ or _select_ committee\r\nappointed to consider this particular matter.\r\n\r\n§7. Committees meet in private rooms, during hours when the house is not\r\nin session; and any person wishing to be heard in favor of or against a\r\nproposed measure, may appear before the committee having it in charge.\r\nHaving duly considered the subject, the committee reports to the house\r\nthe information it has obtained, with the opinion whether the measure\r\nought or ought not to become a law. Measures reported against by\r\ncommittees, seldom receive any further notice from the house.\r\n\r\n§8. From what has been said, the utility of committees is readily seen.\r\nAlthough no proposed measure can become a law unless acted on and\r\napproved by the two houses, its necessity may be inquired into, and the\r\ninformation necessary to enable the house to act understandingly upon\r\nthe question, may be obtained, as well by a few members as by the whole\r\nhouse. By the daily examination of so many subjects in committee, a\r\nlarge amount of business is soon prepared for the house to act upon, and\r\nmuch of its time is saved.\r\n\r\n§9. If a committee reports favorably upon a subject, it usually brings\r\nin a bill with its report. A _bill_ is the form or draft of a law. Not\r\nall bills, however, are reported by committees. Any member of the house\r\ndesiring the passage of a law, may give notice that he will, on some\r\nfuture day, ask leave of the house to introduce a bill for that purpose;\r\nand if, at the time specified, the house shall grant leave, he may\r\nintroduce the bill. But at least one day's previous notice must be given\r\nof his intention to ask leave, before it can be granted.\r\n\r\n§10. The different steps in the progress of a bill, or the different\r\nforms of action through which it has to pass, are numerous. A minute\r\ndescription of them in a work designed chiefly for youth, will scarcely\r\nbe expected. A thorough knowledge of the proceedings of legislative\r\nassemblies, can be practically beneficial, in after life, to but few of\r\nthose who shall study this elementary treatise. Those who shall\r\nhereafter have occasion for this knowledge, will find works adapted to a\r\nmore mature age, in which the subject is fully treated.\r\n\r\n§11. A bill, before it is passed, must be read three times; but it may\r\nnot be read twice on any one day without unanimous consent, that is, the\r\nconsent of the whole house; or, as is believed to be the rule in some\r\nbodies, the consent of three-fourths, or two-thirds of the house. In\r\nsome legislatures, the rule allows the first and second readings to be\r\non the same day. A bill is not to be amended until it shall have been\r\ntwice read. Nor is it usual for it to be opposed until then; but it may\r\nbe opposed and rejected at the first reading.\r\n\r\n§12. After a bill has been twice read, and fully debated and amended, it\r\nis proposed to be read on a future day the third time. If the question\r\non ordering the bill to a third reading is not carried, the bill is\r\nlost, unless revived by a vote of the house to reconsider. But if the\r\nquestion to read the third time is carried, the bill is accordingly read\r\non a future day, and the question taken on its final passage.\r\n\r\n§13. When the final vote is to be taken, the speaker puts the question:\r\n\"Shall the bill pass?\" If a majority of the members present vote in the\r\naffirmative, (the speaker also voting,) the bill is passed; if a\r\nmajority vote in the negative, the bill is lost. Also if the ayes and\r\nnoes are equal, it is lost, because there is not a majority in its\r\nfavor. In a senate where a lieutenant-governor presides, not being\r\nproperly a member, he does not vote, except when the ayes and noes are\r\nequal; in which case there is said to be a _tie_; and he determines the\r\nquestion by his vote, which is called the _casting_ vote. In some\r\nstates, on the final passage of a bill, a bare majority of the members\r\npresent is not sufficient to pass it, in case any members are absent.\r\nThe constitutions of those states require the votes of a majority of\r\n_all the members elected_ to each house.\r\n\r\n§14. When a bill has passed one house it is sent to the other, where it\r\nmust pass through the same forms of action; that is, it must be referred\r\nto a committee; reported by the committee to the house; and be read\r\nthree times before a vote is taken on its passage. This vote having\r\nbeen taken, the bill is returned to the house from which it was\r\nreceived. If it has been amended, the amendments must be agreed to by\r\nthe first house, or the second must recede from their amendments, or the\r\namendments must be so modified as to secure the approval of both houses,\r\nbefore the bill can become a law.\r\n\r\n§15. Some young reader may inquire why a bill should take so long and\r\nslow a course through two different houses; and why one body of\r\nrepresentatives is not sufficient. The object is to secure the enactment\r\nof good laws. Notwithstanding bills go through the hands of a committee\r\nand three different readings in the house; yet through undue haste,\r\nwrong information, or from other causes, a house may, and often does,\r\ncommit serious errors. Legislatures are therefore divided into two\r\nbranches; and a bill having passed one house is sent to the other where\r\nthe mistakes of the former may be corrected, or the bill wholly\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\n§16. But in many of the states, a bill, when passed by both houses, is\r\nnot yet a law. As the two houses may concur in adopting an unwise\r\nmeasure, an additional safeguard is provided against the enactment of\r\nbad laws, by requiring all bills to be sent to the governor for\r\nexamination and approval. If he approves a bill, he signs it, and it is\r\na law; if he does not sign it, it is not a law. In refusing to sign a\r\nbill, he is said to _negative_, or _veto_ the bill. _Veto_, Latin,\r\nmeans, _I forbid_.\r\n\r\n§17. But no governor has full power to prevent the passage of a law. If\r\nhe does not approve a bill, he must return it to the house in which it\r\noriginated, stating his objections to it; and if it shall be again\r\npassed by both houses, it will be a law without the governor's assent\r\nBut in such cases greater majorities are generally required to pass a\r\nlaw. In some states, a majority of two-thirds of the members present is\r\nnecessary; in others, a majority of _all the members elected_. In a few\r\nstates, only the same majorities are required to pass a bill against\r\nthe veto as in the first instance. Or if the governor does not return a\r\nbill within a certain number of days, it becomes a law without his\r\nsignature, or without being considered a second time. In some states,\r\nbills are not sent to the governor, but are laws when passed by both\r\nhouses and signed by their presiding officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII.\r\n\r\nExecutive Department. Governor and Lieutenant-Governor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. The chief executive power of a state is, by the constitution, vested\r\nin a governor. The governor is chosen by the people at the general\r\nelection; in South Carolina by the legislature. The term of office is\r\nnot the same in all the states. In the six New England states, the\r\ngovernors are chosen annually; in the other states, for the different\r\nterms of two, three, and four years.\r\n\r\n§2. The qualifications for the office of governor are also different in\r\nthe different states. To be eligible to the office of governor, a person\r\nmust have been for a certain number of years a citizen of the United\r\nStates, and for a term of years preceding his election a resident of the\r\nstate. He must also be above a certain age, which, in a majority of the\r\nstates, is at least thirty years; and in some states he must be a\r\nfreeholder.\r\n\r\n§3. The powers and duties of a governor are numerous. He communicates by\r\nmessage to the legislature, at every session, information of the\r\ncondition of the state of its affairs generally, and recommends such\r\nmeasures as he judges necessary and expedient. He is to take care that\r\nthe laws be faithfully executed, and to transact all necessary business\r\nwith the officers of the government. He may convene the legislature on\r\nextraordinary occasions: that is, if, at a time when the legislature is\r\nnot in session, a matter should arise requiring immediate attention, the\r\ngovernor may call a special meeting of the legislature, or as it is\r\nusually termed, an extra session.\r\n\r\n§4. A governor has power to grant reprieves and pardons, except in cases\r\nof impeachment, and, in some states, of treason. To _reprieve_ is to\r\npostpone or delay for a time the execution of the sentence of death upon\r\na criminal. To _pardon_ is to annul the sentence by forgiving the\r\noffense and releasing the offender. A governor may also _commute_ a\r\nsentence; which is to exchange one penalty or punishment for another of\r\nless severity; as, when a person sentenced to suffer death, is ordered\r\nto be imprisoned.\r\n\r\n§5. The governor has power also, in some of the states, with the consent\r\nof the senate, to appoint the higher officers of the militia of the\r\nstate, and the higher civil officers in the executive and judicial\r\ndepartments. In a few of the states, there are executive councils whose\r\nadvice and consent are required in such cases. In making such\r\nappointments, the governor nominates, that is, he _names_ to the senate,\r\nin writing, the persons to be appointed. If a majority of the senators\r\nconsent, the persons so nominated are appointed. Many other duties are\r\nby the constitution devolved upon the governor.\r\n\r\n§6. A lieutenant-governor has few duties to perform. He presides in the\r\nsenate, in which he has only a casting vote. In the state of New York,\r\nhe serves in some of the boards of executive officers. In nearly\r\none-half of the states the office of lieutenant-governor does not exist.\r\nThe chief object of electing this officer seems to be to provide a\r\nsuitable person to fill the vacancy in the office of governor in case\r\nthe latter should die, resign, be removed, or otherwise become\r\nincompetent.\r\n\r\n§7. When the lieutenant-governor acts as governor, the senate chooses\r\nfrom its own number a president. If the offices of both the governor and\r\nlieutenant-governor should become vacant, the president of the senate\r\nmust act as governor. If there should be neither a governor, a\r\nlieutenant-governor, nor a president or speaker of the senate, then, the\r\nspeaker of the house of representatives would become the acting\r\ngovernor. This is believed to be the rule for supplying vacancies in\r\nmost if not all of the states.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII.\r\n\r\nAssistant Executive State Officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. Among the executive officers who assist in the administration of the\r\ngovernment, there are in every state, some or all of the following: a\r\nsecretary of state, a controller or auditor, a treasurer, an\r\nattorney-general, a surveyor-general. The mode of their appointment and\r\nthe terms of their respective offices, are prescribed by the\r\nconstitution or by law. In some states they are appointed by the\r\ngovernor and senate; in others by the legislature; and in others they\r\nare elected by the people. They keep their offices at the seat of\r\ngovernment of the state.\r\n\r\n§2. The _secretary of state_ keeps a record of the official acts and\r\nproceedings of the legislature and of the executive departments, and has\r\nthe care of the books, records, deeds of the state, parchments, the laws\r\nenacted by the legislature, and all other papers and documents required\r\nby law to be kept in his office. He causes the laws passed by the\r\nlegislature to be published in one or more newspapers, as directed by\r\nlaw; and also to be printed and bound in a volume, and distributed among\r\nthe state officers for their use, and among the county and town clerks,\r\nto be kept in their offices for the use of the people who wish to\r\nexamine the laws. Also one or more copies are exchanged with each of the\r\nother states for copies of their laws to be kept in the state library.\r\nVarious other duties are performed by the secretary.\r\n\r\n§3. The _state auditor_, in some states called _controller_, manages\r\nthe financial concerns of the state; that is, the business relating to\r\nthe money, debts, land and other property of the state. He examines and\r\nadjusts accounts and claims against the state, and superintends the\r\ncollection of moneys due the state. When money is to be paid out of the\r\ntreasury, he draws a warrant (a written order,) on the treasurer for the\r\nmoney, and keeps a regular account with the treasurer of all moneys\r\nreceived into and paid out of the treasury. And he reports to the\r\nlegislature or other proper officers, a statement of the funds of the\r\nstate, and of its income and expenditures during each year.\r\n\r\n§4. The _treasurer_ has charge of all the public moneys that are paid\r\ninto the treasury, and pays out the same as directed by law; and he\r\nkeeps an accurate account of such moneys, specifying the names of the\r\npersons from whom they are received, to whom paid, and for what\r\npurposes. He also exhibits annually a statement of moneys received and\r\npaid out by him during the year, and of the balance in the treasury.\r\n\r\n§5. Auditors, treasurers, and other officers intrusted with the care and\r\nmanagement of money or other property, are generally required, before\r\nthey enter on the duties of their offices, to give bonds, in sums of\r\ncertain amount specified in the law, with sufficient sureties, for the\r\nfaithful performance of their duties. The sureties are persons who bind\r\nthemselves to pay the state all damages arising from neglect of duty on\r\nthe part of the officers, not exceeding the sum mentioned in the bond.\r\n\r\n§6. The _attorney-general_ is a person learned in the law, appointed to\r\nact for the state in law-suits in which the state is a party. He\r\nprosecutes persons indebted to the state, and causes to be brought to\r\ntrial persons charged with certain crimes. He also gives his opinion on\r\nquestions of law submitted to him by the governor, the legislature, and\r\nthe executive officers. In some states there is no attorney-general. In\r\nsuch states prosecutions in behalf of the state are conducted by the\r\nstate's attorney for each county.\r\n\r\n§7. The _surveyor-general_ superintends the surveying of the lands\r\nbelonging to the state. He keeps in his office maps of the state,\r\ndescribing the bounds of the counties and townships; and when disputes\r\narise respecting the boundaries, he causes surveys to be made, if\r\nnecessary, to ascertain such bounds. He performs certain other duties of\r\na similar nature. In many of the states there is no surveyor-general,\r\nthe duties of that office being done by a county surveyor in each\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\n§8. There is also, in many of the states, a _superintendent of schools_,\r\ncalled in some states, _superintendent of public instruction_, whose\r\nprincipal duties are described in a subsequent chapter. (Chap. XXII,\r\n§10.)\r\n\r\n§9. There is also a printer to the state, or _state printer_, whose\r\nbusiness it is to print the journal, bills, reports, and other papers\r\nand documents of the two houses of the legislature, and all the laws\r\npassed at each session. State printers are either chosen by the\r\nlegislature, or employed by persons authorized to make contracts for the\r\npublic printing; or the printing is let to the lowest bidder.\r\n\r\n§10. There are other officers employed by the state, among whom are the\r\nfollowing: a _state librarian_, who has charge of the state library,\r\nconsisting of books containing matter of a public nature, such as the\r\nlaws of all the states, and of the United States, with a large\r\ncollection of miscellaneous books; persons having the care of the public\r\nbuildings and other property of the state; superintendents of state\r\nprisons, lunatic asylums, and other state institutions, whose duties are\r\nindicated by their titles, and need no particular description.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIV.\r\n\r\nCounties ind County Officers. Powers and Duties of County Officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. Some of the purposes for which a state is divided into small\r\ndistricts have been mentioned. (Chap. VII, §1.) There are other reasons,\r\nequally important, for these territorial divisions. Laws for the whole\r\nstate are made by the legislature; but certain regulations may be\r\nnecessary for the people in some parts of the state which are not needed\r\nin others, and which the people of these places can better make for\r\nthemselves. It is the business of the governor and his assistant\r\nexecutive state officers to execute or carry into effect the laws of the\r\nstate; but they could not see this done in every place, or in every\r\nminute portion of the state. Again, for the convenience of those who may\r\nbe obliged to go to law to obtain redress for injuries, courts of\r\njustice must be established near the residence of every citizen.\r\n\r\n§2. But in order to carry out these objects, a state must be divided\r\ninto small districts with fixed boundaries, that it may be known what\r\npersons come under certain regulations, and over whom these local\r\nofficers are to exercise authority. The smallest territorial divisions\r\nof a state are called _townships_, or _towns_, which contain generally\r\nfrom twenty-five to one hundred square miles, and which, if in a square\r\nform, would be from five to ten miles square. But for certain purposes\r\nlarger districts than townships have been found necessary. These are\r\nformed by the union of several townships, and are called _counties_.\r\nThese divisions are the same as those of England, the country from which\r\nthe colonies (now states) were chiefly settled.\r\n\r\n§3. Counties in England were formerly districts governed by _counts_ or\r\nearls; from which comes the name of _county_. A county was also called\r\n_shire_; and an officer was appointed by the count or earl to perform\r\ncertain acts in the principal town in the county, which was called\r\n_shire town_, and the officer was called _shire-reeve_, or _sheriff_,\r\nwhose powers and duties were similar to those of the sheriff of a county\r\nin this country. The shire town is that in which the court-house and\r\nother county buildings are situate, and where the principal officers of\r\nthe county transact their business. In a few counties there are two\r\ntowns in which the courts are held alternately. Hence each division is\r\ncalled a _half-shire_.\r\n\r\n§4. Counties and towns are bodies politic, or bodies corporate.\r\n_Corporate_ is from the Latin, _corpus_, which means _body_. A\r\n_corporation_, or body politic, is an association of persons authorized\r\nby law to transact business under a common name, and as a single person.\r\nThe laws of the state give such authority to the inhabitants of counties\r\nand towns. The people of a town or county have power, to some extent, to\r\nmanage their own internal affairs, and to make rules and regulations for\r\ntheir government; and they may buy, hold, and sell property, and sue and\r\nbe sued, as an individual. Similar powers are given to rail-road,\r\nbanking, insurance, and other incorporated companies. But there is in\r\nsome respects a difference between these corporations and those which\r\nare created for purposes of government, as states, counties, towns,\r\ncities, and villages, which will be noticed in another place. (Chap.\r\nXVI.)\r\n\r\n§5. As a county possesses various corporate powers, there must be among\r\nits officers some in whose name these powers are to be exercised. In\r\nsome states there is a board of _county commissioners_, (usually three,)\r\nwho exercise corporate powers. In a few, these powers are exercised by\r\nand in the name of the _board of supervisors_, which is composed of the\r\nsupervisors of the several towns in the county, of whom there is one\r\nsupervisor in each town. These boards, or such officers in other states\r\nas exercise these powers, have generally the power also to examine and\r\nsettle the accounts against the county, and to make orders and contracts\r\nin relation to the building or repairing of the court-house, jail, and\r\nother county buildings; and to perform such other acts as the laws\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\n§6. There is in each county a _treasurer_ to receive and pay out the\r\nmoneys required to be collected and paid out in the county. There is\r\nalso, in some states, a county _auditor_ to examine and adjust the\r\naccounts and debts of the county, and to perform certain other duties.\r\nThe business of county treasurers and auditors in their respective\r\ncounties, is of the same nature as that of state auditors and\r\ntreasurers. In states in which there is no county auditor, the duties of\r\nauditor are performed by the treasurer, and some other county officer or\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\n§7. There is also in each county a _register_ or _recorder_, who records\r\nin books provided for that purpose, all deeds, mortgages, and other\r\ninstruments of writing required by law to be recorded. In New York, and\r\nperhaps in some other states, the business of a register or recorder is\r\ndone by a county clerk, who is also clerk of the several courts held in\r\nthe county, and of certain boards of county officers. In some states,\r\ndeeds, mortgages, and other written instruments, are recorded by the\r\ntown clerks of the several towns.\r\n\r\n§8. Another county officer is a _sheriff_, whose duty it is to attend\r\nall the courts held in the county; to execute all warrants, writs, and\r\nother process directed to him by the courts; to apprehend persons\r\ncharged with crime; and to take charge of the jail and of the prisoners\r\ntherein. It is his duty, also, to preserve the public peace; and he may\r\ncause all persons who break the public peace within his knowledge or\r\nview, to give bonds, with sureties, for keeping the peace, and for\r\nappearing at the next court to be held in the county, and to commit them\r\nto jail if they refuse to give such bonds. A sheriff is assisted by\r\ndeputies.\r\n\r\n§9. There are in each county one or more _coroners_, whose principal\r\nduty is, to inquire into the cause of the death of persons who have died\r\nby violence, or suddenly, and by means unknown. Notice of the death of a\r\nperson having so died is given to a coroner, who goes to the place of\r\nsuch dead person. A jury is summoned to attend the examination;\r\nwitnesses are examined; and the jury give their opinion in writing as to\r\nthe cause and manner of the death. Such inquiry is called a _coroner's\r\ninquest_. In one or two states, the office of coroner, it is believed,\r\ndoes not exist; in which case the inquest is held by a justice of the\r\npeace, or some other officer.\r\n\r\n§10. An attorney, elected or appointed for that purpose, attends all\r\ncourts in which persons are tried in the county for crimes committed\r\ntherein, and conducts the prosecutions in the trial of the offenders. In\r\nstates where there is no attorney-general for the state, the prosecuting\r\nattorney for each county serves in this capacity, in trials in which the\r\nstate is a party. As all crimes and breaches of the peace are considered\r\nas committed against the state, and prosecuted in its name, this\r\nattorney is sometimes called _state's attorney_.\r\n\r\n§11. In some states there is a _county-surveyor_, whose duties within\r\nhis county are similar in their nature to those of a state\r\nsurveyor-general.\r\n\r\n§12. County officers are generally elected by the people of the county.\r\nSome of them are, in some of the states, appointed by some authority\r\nprescribed by the constitution or laws of the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XV.\r\n\r\nTowns and Town Officers. Powers and Duties of Town Officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. The districts of territory into which counties are divided, are, in\r\nsome states, called _towns_. In others they are called, and perhaps more\r\nproperly, _townships_; and the name of _town_ is given to an\r\nincorporated village, or a city. We shall, however, in this work, apply\r\nto these territorial divisions the shorter name of _towns_, as they are\r\ncalled in most of the old states.\r\n\r\n§2. The electors of the several towns meet once a year for the election\r\nof town officers, and for certain other business purposes. The electors\r\nof a town have power, at their annual town meetings, to order money to\r\nbe raised for the support of the poor, for the building and repairing of\r\nbridges, and for other town purposes; to make regulations concerning\r\nfences; to fix the compensation of town officers in certain cases; and\r\nto perform such other duties as come within the usual powers of towns.\r\nThe powers of towns, however, are not precisely the same in all the\r\nstates.\r\n\r\n§3. Among the town officers elected at town meetings, are the following;\r\nnot all of them, however, are elected in any one state: One or more\r\npersons who have the general oversight and direction of town affairs,\r\ncalled by some name corresponding to the nature of their duties; a town\r\nclerk; one or more assessors; justices of the peace; overseers of\r\nhighways; overseers of the poor; school officers; constables; a\r\ncollector of taxes; a treasurer; fence-viewers; pound-keepers, &c. In\r\nsome states there are also sealers of weights and measures; persons to\r\nmeasure and inspect wood, lumber, bark, and other commodities.\r\n\r\n§4. The officers first mentioned in the preceding section, are, in the\r\nNew England states, called _selectmen_, of whom there are at least\r\nthree, and may in no state be more than nine, in each town. In a few\r\nstates they are called _trustees of townships_, and are three in number.\r\nIn a few other states, there is in each town one such officer, called\r\n_supervisor_. The powers and duties of these officers are more numerous\r\nin some states than in others. They have power to lay out roads, and lay\r\nout and alter road districts; to do certain acts relating to roads,\r\nbridges, taxes, common schools, the support of the poor, &c.; and to\r\nexamine and settle all demands against the town. In some of the states,\r\nsome of these duties are performed by other officers.\r\n\r\n§5. The _town-clerk_ keeps the records, books, and papers of the town.\r\nHe records in a book the proceedings of town meetings, the names of the\r\npersons elected, and such other papers as are required by law to be\r\nrecorded. In some states, deeds and other conveyances are required to be\r\nrecorded by the clerks of towns.\r\n\r\n[For a description of the duties of _assessors_ and _justices of the\r\npeace_, see Assessment and Collection of Taxes, and Justices' Courts.]\r\n\r\n§6. For the repairing of _highways_, a town is divided by the proper\r\nofficers into as many road districts as may be judged convenient; and a\r\nperson residing in each district is chosen, called _overseer_ or\r\n_supervisor_, or _surveyor_ of _highways_, whose duty it is to see that\r\nthe roads are repaired and kept in order in his district. In some states\r\na tax is laid and collected for this purpose; and each person assessed\r\nmay perform labor or furnish materials to the amount of his tax. In\r\nother states, road taxes are assessed upon the citizens in days' labor,\r\naccording to the value of their property; every man, however, being\r\nfirst assessed one day for his head, which is called a _poll-tax_.\r\nPersons not wishing to labor, may pay an equivalent in money, which is\r\ncalled _commuting_.\r\n\r\n§7. _Overseers of the poor_ provide for the support of the poor\r\nbelonging to the town who need relief, and have no near relations who\r\nare able to support them. In some states there is in each county a\r\npoor-house, to which the poor of the several towns are sent to be\r\nprovided for; the expense to be charged to the towns to which such poor\r\npersons belonged.\r\n\r\n§8. The principal duties of a _constable_ are, to serve all processes\r\nissued by justices of the peace in suits at law for collecting debts,\r\nand for arresting persons charged with crimes. The business of a\r\nconstable in executing the orders of a justice of the peace, is similar\r\nto that of a sheriff in relation to the county courts.\r\n\r\n§9. The town _treasurer_ receives all moneys belonging to the town, and\r\npays them out as they may be wanted for town-purposes; and accounts\r\nyearly to the proper officers. The office of town treasurer does not\r\nexist in all the states.\r\n\r\n§10. The duties of _fence-viewers_ relate chiefly to the settling of\r\ndisputes between the owners of adjoining lands concerning division\r\nfences, the examining or viewing of fences when damage has been done by\r\ntrespassing animals; and the estimating of damages in such cases.\r\n\r\n§11. The town _sealer_ keeps correct copies of the standard of weights\r\nand measures established by the state. Standard copies are furnished by\r\nthe state sealer to each county sealer, at the expense of the county,\r\nand the county sealer furnishes each town sealer a copy at the expense\r\nof the town. The town sealer compares the weights and measures brought\r\nto him with the copy in his possession, and sees that they are made to\r\nagree with it, and seals and marks them. A person selling by a weight or\r\nmeasure that does not agree with the standard, is liable to the\r\npurchaser for damages--generally to several times the amount of the\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\nFor a particular description of the duties of town officers, reference\r\nmust be had to the laws of the several states.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVI.\r\n\r\nIncorporation and Government of Cities, Villages, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. Cities and incorporated villages have governments peculiar to\r\nthemselves. Places containing a large and close population need a\r\ndifferent government from that of ordinary towns or townships. Many of\r\nthe laws regulating the affairs of towns thinly inhabited, are not\r\nsuited to a place where many thousand persons are closely settled.\r\nBesides, the electors in such a place would be too numerous to meet in a\r\nsingle assembly for the election of officers or the transaction of other\r\npublic business.\r\n\r\n§2. Whenever, therefore, the inhabitants of any place become so numerous\r\nas to require a city government, they petition the legislature for a law\r\nincorporating them into a city. The law or act of incorporation is\r\nusually called a _charter_. The word _charter_ is from the Latin\r\n_charta_, which means paper. The instruments of writing by which kings\r\nor other sovereign powers granted rights and privileges to individuals\r\nor corporations, were written on paper or parchment, and called\r\n_charters_. In this country, it is commonly used to designate an act of\r\nthe legislature conferring privileges and powers upon cities, villages,\r\nand other corporations.\r\n\r\n§3. The chief executive officer of a city is a _mayor_. A city is\r\ndivided into wards of convenient size, in each of which are chosen one\r\nor more _aldermen_, (usually two,) and such other officers as are named\r\nin the charter. The mayor and aldermen constitute the _common council_,\r\nwhich is a kind of legislature, having the power to pass such laws,\r\n(commonly called _ordinances_,) and to make such orders and regulations,\r\nas the government of the city requires. The mayor presides in meetings\r\nof the common council, and performs also certain judicial and other\r\nduties. There are also elected in the several wards, assessors,\r\nconstables, collectors, and other necessary officers, whose duties in\r\ntheir respective wards are similar to those of like named officers in\r\ncountry towns, or townships.\r\n\r\n§4. The inhabitants of cities, however, are not wholly governed by laws\r\nmade by the common council. Most of the laws enacted by the legislature\r\nare of general application, and have the same effect in cities as\r\nelsewhere. Thus the laws of the state require, that taxes shall be\r\nassessed and levied upon the property of the citizens of the state to\r\ndefray the public expenses; and the people of the cities are required to\r\npay their just proportion of the same; but the city authorities lay and\r\ncollect additional taxes for city purposes.\r\n\r\n§5. In cities there are also courts of justice other than those which\r\nare established by the constitution or general laws of the state. There\r\nis a court for the trial of persons guilty of disturbing the peace, and\r\nof such other minor offenses as are usually punishable by imprisonment\r\nin the county jail, called _police court_. It is held by a _police\r\njustice_, elected by the people, or appointed in such manner as the law\r\nprescribes. In some of the larger cities, there are courts of _civil_ as\r\nwell as criminal jurisdiction, differing from those which are common to\r\ncounties generally.\r\n\r\n§6. The government of incorporated _villages_ is not in all respects\r\nlike that of cities. The chief executive officer of such a village is,\r\nin some states, called _president_. The village is not divided into\r\nwards; the number of its inhabitants being too small to require such\r\ndivision. Instead of a board of aldermen, there is a board of _trustees_\r\nor _directors_, who exercise similar powers. The president of a village\r\nis generally chosen by the trustees from their own number. In some\r\nstates, incorporated villages are called _towns_; and their chief\r\nexecutive officer is called _mayor_.\r\n\r\n§7. The necessity and effect of incorporating a village may not yet\r\nclearly appear to every reader. Let us illustrate. By a general law of\r\nthe state, or by a vote of the electors of a township in pursuance of\r\nsuch law, cattle may run at large in the highways. This might be to many\r\npersons in a village, a great annoyance, which can be prevented or\r\nabated only by confining the cattle. Or, sidewalks may need to be made.\r\nOr, it may be deemed necessary to provide means for extinguishing fires,\r\nby purchasing fire-engines and organizing fire companies. In an\r\nunincorporated village there is no power to compel the citizens to do\r\nthese things. Those, therefore, who desire that the citizens should have\r\npower to make all needful regulations for the government of the village,\r\npetition the legislature for an act of incorporation granting the\r\nnecessary powers.\r\n\r\n§8. The constitutions of some states require the legislature to pass a\r\ngeneral law prescribing the manner in which the people of any village\r\nmay form themselves into a corporation, with the necessary powers of\r\ngovernment, with out a special law for that purpose.\r\n\r\n§9. Besides these _territorial_ corporations for purposes of government,\r\nas counties, towns, cities, &c., there are _incorporated companies_ for\r\ncarrying on business of various kinds, as turnpike and rail-road\r\ncompanies, and companies for the purposes of banking, insurance,\r\nmanufacturing, &c. These kinds of business, to be carried on\r\nsuccessfully, sometimes require a larger amount of money than one man\r\npossesses. A number of persons, therefore, unite their capital under an\r\nact of incorporation granting them power to manage their business which\r\nthey could not have in an ordinary business partnership. Besides, a\r\ncommon partnership must end on the death of any one of the partners; but\r\nan incorporated company is not thus affected by the death of its\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n§10. It is in the nature of corporations to have a perpetual existence.\r\nA corporation may live after the persons who first composed it are all\r\ndead; for those who come after them have the same powers and privileges.\r\nA town or city incorporated a hundred years ago, is the same town or\r\ncity still, although none of its first inhabitants are living. So a\r\nrailroad or banking corporation may exist after the death of many, or\r\neven all of the original corporators.\r\n\r\n§11. But there are certain particulars in which all corporations are not\r\nthe same. A state has been defined to be a body politic, or corporation.\r\n(Chap. I. §10; III, §5.) But it differs from other government\r\ncorporations, as counties, towns, cities, &c., in this: the latter are\r\nformed by acts of the legislature; but a state is formed by the people\r\nin their political capacity in establishing the constitution.\r\n\r\n§12. Again, all these government corporations differ from incorporated\r\nbusiness companies. In forming a town or city, many persons are brought\r\ninto the corporation against their wishes or consent; because, in\r\ngovernments, all who live within certain prescribed bounds must come\r\nunder the same laws; but of an incorporated business association, as of\r\na common business partnership, none become members but by their own act\r\nor choice. There is another difference: The latter are what are called\r\n_stock_ companies; and although they may be continued after the death of\r\nthe first corporators, those who afterward come into the association, do\r\nso by becoming owners of the capital stock of those who preceded them.\r\nThis latter difference will more clearly appear from the more particular\r\ndescription, elsewhere given, of the incorporated companies, and of the\r\nmanner in which the stock is transferred. (Chap. XXIII, §11--15.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVII.\r\n\r\nJudicial Department. Justices' Courts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. Having seen how the legislative and executive departments of a state\r\ngovernment are constituted, and how the laws are made and executed, the\r\nmanner in which the local affairs of counties and towns are conducted,\r\nand the powers and duties of their respective officers; we proceed to\r\ndescribe the _judicial_ department, the powers and duties of judicial\r\nofficers, and the manner in which justice is administered.\r\n\r\n§2. It is the business of the legislature to determine what acts shall\r\nbe deemed public offenses, or crimes, and to make laws for securing\r\njustice to the citizens in their dealings and general intercourse with\r\neach other; but to judge of and apply the laws; that is, to determine\r\nwhat the law is and whether it has been broken, and to fix the just\r\nmeasure of damage or of punishment, and to order such decision to be\r\ncarried into effect, are duties which, as has been observed, have been\r\nwisely assigned to a separate and distinct department. (Chap. VIII. §7.)\r\n\r\n§3. A government without some power to decide disputes, to award\r\njustice, and to punish crime according to the laws of the state, would\r\nnot be complete. To allow every man to be his own judge in cases of\r\nsupposed injury, and to redress his own wrongs, would endanger the\r\nrights of others. Justice is best secured to the citizens by\r\nestablishing courts for the redress of injuries and the punishment of\r\ncrimes; and that no person may suffer unjustly, it is provided that\r\nevery person charged with crime or any other wrong, is entitled to a\r\nfair and impartial trial.\r\n\r\n§4. For the convenience of persons who may be compelled to seek relief\r\nat law, courts are established in every town. These are courts of the\r\nlowest grade, and are called _justices' courts_, being held by justices\r\nof the peace who are, in most of the states, elected by the people of\r\nthe several towns. They are called the lowest courts, because they have\r\njurisdiction only in cases in which the smallest sums or damages are\r\nclaimed, or in which only the lowest offenses are tried. The word\r\n_jurisdiction_ is from the Latin _jus_, law, or _juris_, of the law, and\r\n_dictio_, a pronouncing or speaking. Hence the _jurisdiction_ of a court\r\nmeans its power to pronounce the law.\r\n\r\n§5. Although justices of the peace are generally elected in the towns,\r\ntheir jurisdiction extends over the county; that is, they have power to\r\ntry causes arising in any part of the county, or between citizens\r\nresiding in other towns. The jurisdiction of justices of the peace is\r\ngenerally prescribed by law. The law prescribes the sum that may be sued\r\nfor, or the amount of damage that may be recovered in a justice's court,\r\nand the grade of offenses that may be tried in it. In some states\r\njustices of the peace may try suits only in which the sum in controversy\r\ndoes not exceed $50; but in most of them, the jurisdiction of a justice\r\nextends, it is believed, to sums of $100 or more.\r\n\r\n§6. Causes, in which money is claimed for damage or for debt, are called\r\n_civil_ causes; those for the trial of persons charged with crime, or\r\nsome misdemeanor, are called _criminal_ causes. All crimes, strictly\r\nspeaking, are misdemeanors. In common usage, however, the word\r\n_misdemeanor_ denotes a smaller offense, such as is usually punishable\r\nby fine, or by imprisonment in a county jail, and not in a state prison.\r\nCauses, actions, and suits, are words of similar meaning in law\r\nlanguage, being generally used to signify prosecutions at law, or\r\nlawsuits. The party that sues is called _plaintiff_; the party sued is\r\nthe _defendant_.\r\n\r\n§7. Prosecutions at law are conducted in nearly the same manner in the\r\ndifferent states. The following is a sketch of the proceedings in an\r\nordinary civil suit in a justice's court: The justice, at the request of\r\nthe plaintiff, issues a _summons_, which is a writ or precept addressed\r\nto a constable of the town, in some states to any constable of the\r\ncounty, commanding him to summon the defendant to appear before the\r\njustice on a day and at an hour specified, to answer the plaintiff\r\n(naming him) in a suit, the nature of which is stated in the summons.\r\n\r\n§8. The constable serves the summons by reading it or stating the\r\nsubstance of it to the defendant; and if requested, gives him a copy of\r\nit. If he does not find the defendant, he leaves a copy at his place of\r\nresidence with some one of the family of proper age. At or before the\r\ntime named for trial, the constable returns to the justice the summons\r\nwith an indorsement stating the day on which it was served, and whether\r\nserved personally or by copy. If served by copy, and the defendant does\r\nnot appear at the time named for trial, a new summons is issued, as the\r\npractice is in some states--perhaps all of them; and the trial may not\r\nproceed unless a summons has been personally served.\r\n\r\n§9. The parties may appear in person, or by attorney. An _attorney_ is\r\nany person lawfully appointed to transact business for another; hence\r\nthe word attorney does not always mean an attorney at law, or lawyer,\r\nwho is properly an officer of a court of law. When the parties have\r\nappeared and answered to their names, they make their _pleadings_; that\r\nis, the plantiff declares for what he brings his suit; and the defendant\r\nstates the nature of what he has to _offset_ against the demand of the\r\nplaintiff, or denies the demand altogether. These acts of the parties\r\nare called _joining issue_.\r\n\r\n§10. If the parties are ready for trial, the justice proceeds to try the\r\nissue. If the witnesses have not been subpœned and are not in\r\nattendance, the cause is adjourned to a future day; and the justice, at\r\nthe request of either party, issues a _subpœna_, which is a writ\r\ncommanding persons to attend in court as witnesses. The witnesses on\r\nboth sides are examined by the justice, who decides according to law and\r\nequity, as the right of the case may appear, in which he is said to\r\n_give judgment_. To the amount of the judgment, whether against the\r\nplaintiff or the defendant, are added the costs; for it is considered to\r\nbe just that the party in default shall pay the expense of the suit.\r\nThe costs consist of the _fees_ or compensation to be paid the justice,\r\nconstable and witnesses for their services.\r\n\r\n§11. If a defendant does not appear at the time of trial, the justice\r\nmay proceed to try the cause, and decide upon the testimony of the\r\nplaintiff's witnesses. If a plaintiff does not answer or appear when his\r\nname is called in court, the justice enters judgment of _nonsuit_. A\r\nplaintiff may, at any time before judgment is rendered, discontinue or\r\nwithdraw his action, in which case also judgment of nonsuit is given. In\r\ncases of nonsuit, and also when no cause of action is found, judgment is\r\nrendered against the plantiff for the costs.\r\n\r\n§12. A debtor may avoid the expense of a lawsuit by _confessing\r\njudgment_. The parties go before a justice, and the debtor acknowledges\r\nor confesses the claim of the creditor, and consents that the justice\r\nenter judgment accordingly. In some states, the confession and consent\r\nmust be in writing, and signed by the debtor. The amount for which\r\njudgment may be confessed is limited by law, but is, in some states at\r\nleast, and perhaps in most if not all of them, larger than the sum to\r\nwhich the jurisdiction of a justice is limited in ordinary suits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVIII.\r\n\r\nTrial by Jury; Execution; Attachment; Appeals; Arrest of Offenders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. The administration of justice in courts of law is not left entirely\r\nto the justices and judges. Parties may not always have sufficient\r\nconfidence in the ability, honesty, and impartiality of the justice by\r\nwhom a suit is to be tried, to intrust their interests to his judgment.\r\nTherefore the constitutions of all the states guaranty to every person\r\nthe right of trial by a jury. This right has been enjoyed in England\r\nmany centuries. It was established here by our ancestors, who were\r\nprincipally from that country.\r\n\r\n§2. A _jury_ is a number of men qualified and selected as the law\r\nprescribes, and sworn to try a matter of fact, and to declare the truth\r\non the evidence given in the case. This declaring of the truth is called\r\na _verdict_, which is from the Latin _verum dictum_, a true declaration\r\nor saying. A jury in a justice's court consists in most or all of the\r\nstates, as is believed, of six men; in the higher courts, of twelve men,\r\nwho are generally required to be freeholders. The manner of selecting\r\nthe jurors is not the same in all the states.\r\n\r\n§3. After issue has been joined, and before testimony has been heard,\r\neither party may demand that the cause be tried by a jury. Whereupon the\r\njustice issues a _venire_, which is a writ or precept directing a\r\nconstable to summon the required number of duly qualified men to appear\r\nbefore the justice, to make a jury to try the cause.\r\n\r\n§4. The testimony and arguments on both sides having been heard, the\r\njurors are put under the charge of the constable, who is sworn to keep\r\nthem in some convenient place, without meat or drink, except such as the\r\njustice may order, until they shall have agreed on their verdict, or\r\nhave been discharged by the justice; and not to allow any person to\r\nspeak to them during such time, nor to speak to them himself, except by\r\norder of the justice, unless to ask them whether they have agreed on\r\ntheir verdict.\r\n\r\n§5. All the jurors must agree in a verdict; and when so agreed, they\r\nreturn in charge of the constable, and, in open court, deliver their\r\nverdict to the justice, who enters judgment according to the finding of\r\nthe jury. If the jurors, after having been out a reasonable time, do not\r\nall agree upon a verdict, the justice may discharge them, and issue a\r\nnew venire, unless the parties consent to submit the cause to the\r\njustice.\r\n\r\n§6. If a judgment is not paid within the time prescribed by law, the\r\njustice issues an _execution_, which is a precept directing a constable\r\nto collect the amount of the judgment; and authorizing him to take and\r\nsell the goods and chattels of the debtor, and to make his returns to\r\nthe justice within the time required. _Goods_ and _chattels_ are\r\npersonal or movable property, or property other than freehold, or real\r\nestate. If the money can not be collected, the execution is returned as\r\nnot satisfied. If a constable does not faithfully obey the directions\r\ncontained in the execution, he and his sureties become liable to pay the\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\n§7. Laws have been passed in all the states for the benefit of poor men,\r\nwho are allowed to retain, for the use and comfort of themselves and\r\ntheir families, certain articles of personal property, which may not be\r\nsold on execution; such as necessary household furniture, apparel, beds,\r\ntools and implements of trade, &c. The practice which formerly\r\nprevailed, of imprisoning debtors who were unable to satisfy executions,\r\nhas been abolished, except for fines and penalties.\r\n\r\n§8. The foregoing description of the proceedings of a justice's court is\r\nthat of a prosecution in ordinary cases. But there are other modes of\r\nprosecution in certain cases, one of which is by attachment. An\r\n_attachment_ is a writ directing the property of a debtor to be taken,\r\nand kept till a trial can be had, and judgment obtained. This mode of\r\nproceeding is adopted when the plaintiff has reason to believe that a\r\ndebtor conceals himself to avoid being prosecuted by summons, or is\r\nabout to remove his property or himself from the county, or intends in\r\nsome other way to defraud his creditors.\r\n\r\n§9. In case of an absent or concealed debtor, the constable, (as is\r\nsupposed to be the common practice,) leaves a copy of the attachment,\r\nwith an inventory or list of the articles of property attached, at the\r\ndefendant's last place of abode, or, if he had none in the county, the\r\ncopy and inventory are to be left with the person in whose possession\r\nthe property is found. If the defendant does not appear on the day of\r\ntrial, the plaintiff may proceed to prove his demand and take judgment.\r\nAn execution is then issued against the property attached.\r\n\r\n§10. If either party is dissatisfied with a judgment rendered in a\r\njustice's court, he may _appeal_ to a higher court for trial, or for a\r\nreview of the judgment. The party appealing is called _appellant_; the\r\nadverse party is the _appellee_ or _respondent_.\r\n\r\n§11. An important part of the duties of a justice of the peace relates\r\nto the arrest and trial of persons charged with crimes and misdemeanors.\r\nAlthough they have not power to try high offenses usually called crimes,\r\nthey may order the apprehension of persons charged with such offenses,\r\nand cause them to be committed for trial.\r\n\r\n§12. A person knowing or suspecting another to have committed an\r\noffense, may make complaint to a judge or justice of the peace, who\r\nexamines the complainant on oath, and witnesses, if any appear; and if\r\nhe is satisfied that an offense has been committed, he issues a\r\n_warrant_, directing the person accused to be brought before him. The\r\ncomplainant and witnesses for the prosecution, and next the prisoner and\r\nhis witnesses, are examined. If the offense is one of which the\r\nmagistrate has jurisdiction, he may proceed to try the prisoner, who, it\r\nwill be recollected, is entitled to be tried by a jury.\r\n\r\n§13. If the offense is one which the magistrate has not power to try, he\r\nbinds the prosecutor or complainant and all material witnesses to appear\r\nand testify against the prisoner at the next court having power to\r\nindict and try him. And if the offense is one for which the prisoner may\r\nbe bailed, the magistrate takes bail for his appearance at court. If the\r\noffense is not bailable, or if no satisfactory bail is offered, the\r\nmagistrate orders him to be committed to jail to await his trial. But,\r\nas will be seen hereafter, he must be indicted by a grand jury before he\r\ncan be tried. (Chap. XIX., §7-9.) And were there no danger of an\r\noffender's escape before he could be brought to trial, his previous\r\narrest and examination might be unnecessary.\r\n\r\n§14. The obligation or bond given by a prosecutor and witnesses for\r\ntheir appearance at court, is sometimes called a _recognizance_. They\r\nbind themselves, with sureties, to forfeit and pay a certain sum of\r\nmoney in case of their non-appearance. A similar bond or recognizance is\r\ngiven in case of bail. The person accused binds himself, with sureties,\r\nin such sum as the justice requires, which is to be paid if he shall not\r\nappear for trial. The word _bail_ is from a French word meaning _to\r\ndeliver_, or _to release_. Hence, the justice _bails_, sets free, or\r\ndelivers to his sureties, the party arrested. Also the sureties are said\r\nto bail a person when they procure his liberation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIX.\r\n\r\nCourts other than Justices' Courts; Grand and Petit Juries, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. The court next higher than a justice's court, is a court held in\r\neach county, generally called a _county court_, or _court of common\r\npleas_. This court is usually held by a county judge elected by the\r\nelectors of the county in most of the states; in some, appointed by the\r\nlegislature; and in others, by the governor, with the advice and consent\r\nof the senate. In a few of the states this court consists of more than\r\none judge. In some states, county courts are held by judges of the\r\ncircuit courts.\r\n\r\n§2. In this court are tried civil causes in which are claimed sums of\r\ngreater amount than a justice of the peace has jurisdiction of, and\r\ncriminal causes in which are charged the lower crimes committed in the\r\ncounty. Also causes removed by appeal from a justice's court are tried\r\nin this court; in which cases it is said to have _appellate_\r\njurisdiction. Courts are also said to have _original_ jurisdiction;\r\nwhich means that suits may _originate_ or commence in such courts.\r\n\r\n§3. There is in every state at least one court, and in most of the\r\nstates there are two or more courts of higher grade than a county court.\r\nThey are called in the different states by different names; as _circuit\r\ncourt_, _superior court_, _supreme court_, and _court of appeals_. A\r\n_circuit_ court probably obtains its name thus: A state is divided into\r\njudicial districts, in each of which one or more judges are elected,\r\nwho go around holding a court once a year or oftener in each of the\r\ncounties composing a judicial district. This court usually has both\r\noriginal and appellate jurisdiction; it being a part of its business to\r\ntry appeals from the county courts. It also tries such of the higher\r\ncrimes as a county court has not the power to try. Courts in which\r\ncrimes are tried are sometimes called courts of _oyer and terminer_.\r\n\r\n§4. Every county court, and every circuit having like jurisdiction, has\r\na jury to try issues of fact, and a grand jury. An _issue of fact_ is\r\nwhen the _fact_ as to the indebtedness or the guilt of the party charged\r\nis to be determined from the testimony. An _issue of law_ is one in\r\nwhich it is to be determined what is the _law_ in the case, which is\r\ndone by the judge instead of the jury. The jury by which issues of fact\r\nare tried, as distinguished from a grand jury, is called a _petty_ or\r\n_petit jury_. It consists of twelve men, all of whom must agree in a\r\nverdict.\r\n\r\n§5. The manner of selecting grand and petit jurors is prescribed by law.\r\nA number of judicious men in each town are selected by some person or\r\npersons lawfully authorized; and the names of the men so selected are\r\nwritten on separate pieces of paper, and put into a box in each town,\r\nand kept by the town clerk; or as is the practice in some states, the\r\nnames of the men designated as jurors in the several towns are sent to\r\nthe county clerk, and by him kept in a box. Previous to the sitting of\r\nthe court, the requisite number is drawn out the box; and the men whose\r\nnames are drawn, are summoned to attend as jurors.\r\n\r\n§6. It is the business of a _grand jury_ to inquire concerning crimes\r\nand misdemeanors committed in the county; and if there appear just\r\ngrounds of accusation against any person, they make to the court a\r\npresentment or formal charge against him, upon which he is to be put\r\nupon trial. The number of grand jurors is not always the same. In some\r\nstates there may not be more than twenty-three nor less than twelve. It\r\nis not required that they shall all agree in order to put a person upon\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\n§7. On the opening of the court, the grand jurors are sworn to make a\r\ntrue presentment of all things given them in charge. The judge then\r\ngives them a charge, and appoints one of them foreman; and the jurors\r\nretire to a private apartment to attend to their duties. They hear all\r\ncomplaints brought before them against persons for crimes and breaches\r\nof the peace, and examine witnesses who appear to testify; and when it\r\nis requested, they have the assistance and advice of the state's\r\nattorney; or as he is called in some states, the _district attorney_, or\r\n_prosecuting attorney_. If they think any person complained of ought to\r\nbe tried, they draw up a writing, in which they charge him with the\r\noffense of which they think him guilty. This is called an _indictment_.\r\nIt is signed by the foreman, indorsed \"a true bill,\" and carried by the\r\njury into court. If the person accused has not before been arrested, he\r\nmay now be arrested, and put upon trial. (See Chap. XVIII, §12-14.)\r\n\r\n§8. As grand juries do not try crimes, but merely make inquiry into\r\nthem, some may not readily perceive the necessity of such juries.\r\nInnocent persons might be subjected to great inconvenience and expense\r\nin defending themselves in court against the slanderous reports or false\r\naccusations of evil minded persons. It is to prevent this that grand\r\njuries are instituted, who make careful examinations into the cases\r\nbrought before them, and do not often charge persons with crime unless\r\nthere is a strong probability of their being found guilty on trial.\r\n\r\n§9. So important was the institution of grand juries considered, that\r\nthe constitution of the United States, to which the constitutions and\r\nlaws of the states must conform, was made to provide, that \"no person\r\nshall be held to answer for a capital or other infamous crime, unless on\r\na presentment or indictment of a grand jury,\" except in certain cases.\r\n(Con. U.S., Amend. Art. V. For the definition of \"infamous crime,\" see\r\nChap. VI., §7.)\r\n\r\n§10. It is the opinion of many that this requirement of a previous\r\nindictment by a grand jury has reference only to the courts of the\r\nUnited States; and that the states may dispense with it. Hence, efforts\r\nare now making in some states to abolish grand juries. It is supposed\r\nthat an examination at all times before a justice or a judge, when the\r\nprisoner can be present with his witnesses, is more likely to protect\r\nhim against being unnecessarily subjected to the trouble and expense of\r\na trial, than before a grand jury, where complaints are often made by\r\nmalicious persons, and sustained by the testimony of partial or corrupt\r\nwitnesses.\r\n\r\n§11. The _supreme court_ is generally the next higher, and in most of\r\nthe states, the highest state court. This court differs somewhat in the\r\ndifferent states, both in the manner of its formation and in its\r\njurisdiction. It is believed, however, to have, in the states generally,\r\nboth original and appellate jurisdiction, civil and criminal. In the\r\nstate of New York and a few other states, there is one higher court,\r\ncalled _court of appeals_, which has appellate power only. Its business\r\nis to review cases from the supreme court.\r\n\r\n§12. Suits in the county, circuit, and supreme courts, are commenced by\r\na _writ_, (in some states a summons or a declaration,) which is served\r\nby the sheriff of the county in which the suit is to be tried. He also\r\nserves warrants and executions issued by these courts. A sheriff is to\r\nthese courts what a constable is to a justice's court. His powers and\r\nduties have been elsewhere described. (Chap. XIV., §8.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XX.\r\n\r\nChancery or Equity Courts; Probate Courts; Court of Impeachment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. It might be supposed, that in instituting the courts which have been\r\ndescribed, all necessary provision had been made for securing justice to\r\nthe citizens. But many cases arise in which justice and equity can not\r\nbe obtained in these courts. To afford relief in such cases, a court\r\nhas been established called a _court of equity_, or _court of chancery_.\r\nWhat often renders it impossible to get justice in ordinary courts of\r\nlaw, is the want of witnesses; but in a court of equity the parties may\r\nthemselves be put on oath.\r\n\r\n§2. A debtor, to avoid the payment of his debts, may conceal his\r\nproperty or his money; but this court may compel him to disclose and\r\ngive up the same to satisfy an execution; and it may prevent persons\r\nindebted to him from making payment to him. A person refusing to fulfill\r\na contract may, in courts of common law, only be sued for damage; but\r\nthis court may in certain cases compel him to fulfill the contract\r\nitself. It may also restrain individuals and corporations from\r\ncommitting fraudulent acts, and prevent persons from committing wastes\r\non land and certain other injuries, until the right at law can be tried.\r\n\r\n§3. Courts of chancery were established, it is believed, in a majority\r\nof the old states. But separate and distinct organizations called\r\nchancery courts, now exist in but a few states; the power to try suits\r\nin equity having been given to the judges of the common law courts.\r\n\r\n§4. Suits _in equity_ are not commenced as suits _at law_. The plaintiff\r\nprepares a bill of complaint, the facts stated in which are sworn to by\r\nhimself. The bill, which contains a petition or prayer that the\r\ndefendant may be summoned to make answer on oath, is filed with the\r\nclerk of the court, who issues a subpœna commanding the defendant to\r\nappear before the court on a day named. A trial may be had on the\r\ncomplaint and answer alone; or witnesses may be introduced by the\r\nparties. The case is argued by counsel, and a _decree_ is pronounced by\r\nthe court, which the court has power to carry into effect.\r\n\r\n§5. There is another kind of courts which are in their nature different\r\nfrom ordinary law courts, and are called _probate courts_. There is in\r\nevery county a probate court held by a _judge of probate_, whose duties\r\nrelate to the proving of wills and the settling of the estates of\r\npersons deceased. A _will_ is a writing in which a person gives\r\ndirections concerning the disposal of his property after his death. The\r\nLatin word _probatus_ means proof; from which _probate_ has come to be\r\napplied to the proving of a will. (See Wills and Testaments.) In the\r\nstate of New York the judge of this court is called _surrogate_, and the\r\ncourt is called _surrogate's court_.\r\n\r\n§6. There is still another court in every state, which is not a common\r\nlaw court. It is the _court of impeachment_. The name is applied to the\r\nsenate when sitting on a trial of impeachment. An _impeachment_ is a\r\ncharge or accusation against a public officer for corrupt conduct in his\r\noffice; as if a governor, for money offered him, should approve and sign\r\na law; or a judge should, for money or from some other selfish or\r\npersonal motive, give a wrong judgment. The constitution gives to the\r\nhouse of representatives the power to impeach, and to the senate the\r\npower to try the persons impeached. This practice has come from Great\r\nBritain, where the impeachment is made by the house of commons, and the\r\nhouse of lords is the high court of impeachment.\r\n\r\n§7. The house of representatives, in a case of impeachment, acts in\r\nnearly the same manner as a grand jury in a court of law. A complaint is\r\nmade to the house; and if, upon examination, there appear to a majority\r\nof the members present sufficient grounds for the charge, an accusation\r\nin writing is prepared, called _articles of impeachment_, and delivered\r\nto the senate. In some states, a majority of the members elected is\r\nnecessary to impeach. The president of the senate orders the court to be\r\nsummoned. The accused is brought before the court to answer to the\r\ncharge, and has counsel assigned him. The senators are sworn truly to\r\ntry and determine the impeachment according to evidence; and a day is\r\nfixed for trial.\r\n\r\n§8. The house of representatives usually choose from their number a\r\ncommittee of managers to conduct the trial, the proceedings in which are\r\nthe same as in law courts. The senators retire and deliberate as jurors\r\nin such courts. Two-thirds of the senators--in some states two-thirds of\r\nall the senators elected--must concur in order to convict the person\r\naccused. If a person is convicted, the court may remove him from\r\noffice, or disqualify him to hold any office in the state, for a time,\r\nor for life; or may both remove and disqualify him. This court can\r\npronounce no other sentence. But if the act committed is a crime, the\r\noffender may also be indicted, tried, and punished in a court of\r\njustice.\r\n\r\n§9. Judicial officers may also be removed by the governor on address of\r\nthe legislature. If a judge is suspected of corrupt conduct in his\r\noffice, or of being incompetent to discharge its duties, complaint is\r\nmade to the legislature, and the party complained of is notified, and an\r\nopportunity is given him of being heard in his defense. If both\r\nbranches, by the required majorities, concur in the opinion that he\r\nought to be removed, they address the governor, setting forth their\r\nreasons for the removal. If the governor considers the reasons\r\nsufficient, the officer is removed. This mode of removal does not exist\r\nin all the states. In New York, and perhaps in a few other states, the\r\nlegislature makes the removal without the concurrence of the governor;\r\nand in that state some of the lower judicial officers may be removed by\r\nthe senate on the recommendation of the governor. In a few states,\r\njudges are not removable by impeachment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXI.\r\n\r\nAssessment and Collection of Taxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. Every government must have the power of providing means for its\r\nsupport. The money which is needed to pay the expenses of administering\r\nthe government, if the state has no permanent source of revenue, or\r\nincome, must be raised by taxation. A _tax_ is a rate or sum of money\r\nassessed upon the person or property of a citizen for the use of the\r\nstate. When assessed upon the person, it is called a _poll-tax_, or\r\n_capitation tax_, being a certain sum on every poll, or head. But as\r\npersons ought generally to contribute to the public expenses according\r\nto their ability, taxes are more just and equal when laid upon the\r\nproperty of the citizens. Few poll-taxes are levied in this country.\r\n\r\n§2. There are certain kinds of property which are exempt from taxation;\r\nsuch as the corporate property of the state, of counties, and of towns,\r\nincluding the buildings in which the public business is done, the\r\nprisons, jails, asylums, &c., and the lands attached to them;\r\nschool-houses and meeting-houses, with the lands attached;\r\nburying-grounds, and the property of literary and charitable\r\ninstitutions. But the property of business corporations, as rail-road,\r\nbanking, insurance, manufacturing, and other stock companies, like that\r\nof individuals, is liable to taxation. _Real estate_, or _real\r\nproperty_, is land with the buildings and other articles erected or\r\ngrowing thereon. _Personal estate_, or _personal property_, consists of\r\nmovables, as goods, chattels, money, and debts due from solvent debtors.\r\n\r\n§3. As the property of every person is to be assessed in proportion to\r\nits value, it is necessary, first, to make a correct valuation of all\r\nthe taxable property. For this purpose, the assessor or assessors pass\r\nthrough the town, and make a list of the names of all the taxable\r\ninhabitants, and the estimated value of the property, real and personal,\r\nof each; and returns of the same are made to the proper county officers,\r\nwho cause the tax-list for each town to be made out, and order the taxes\r\nto be collected.\r\n\r\n§4. In some states, persons liable to taxation are themselves required\r\nto furnish lists of all their taxable property, printed blank lists\r\nhaving been previously distributed among them for this purpose. To\r\nsecure an accurate valuation, the assessors, (called also _listers_,)\r\nmay require persons to make oath that they have made a true statement of\r\ntheir property and its value. In states where the polls of the\r\ntax-payers are assessed, these also are set down in the lists at such\r\nsums as the law directs to be affixed to each poll.\r\n\r\n§5. Before a tax-list can be made out, it must be known what amount is\r\nto be collected in each town. This amount is made up of three parts:\r\nFirst, the sum wanted to pay the expenses of the town for the preceding\r\nyear; secondly, the town's share of the county expenses; and thirdly,\r\nits proportional share of the expenses of the state government, or of\r\nwhat is to be raised for state purposes.\r\n\r\n§6. The apportionment of the amount of the state and county expenses\r\namong the several towns, is made according to the amount of property in\r\neach as valued by the assessors. The state auditor or controller, having\r\nreceived from the several counties returns of the value of the property\r\nin each county, is enabled to determine its quota of the amount to be\r\nraised for state purposes. To each county's share of the state expenses\r\nis added the sum to be raised in the county for county purposes; and the\r\namount is apportioned among the towns in proportion to the value of the\r\nassessed property of each. Then adding to each town's share of the\r\namount of the state and county expenses, the amount to be raised for\r\ntown purposes, gives the sum to be collected in the town.\r\n\r\n§7. Having thus ascertained the sum to be raised in each town, the\r\nofficers whose duty it is, cause a tax-list to be made out, in which the\r\namount of each person's tax is set opposite his name and the estimated\r\nvalue of his property. The tax-list of each town, certified and signed\r\nby the proper persons, is put into the hands of the collector, with a\r\nwarrant ordering the same to be collected.\r\n\r\n§8. The money collected for county and state purposes is paid to the\r\ncounty treasurer, who pays to the state treasurer the amount raised in\r\nthe county for state expenses, and retains the remainder to be expended\r\nin the county. The money collected for town purposes is paid to such\r\npersons in the town as are by law authorized to receive the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXII.\r\n\r\nEducation. School Funds; Schools, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. The proper object of government is to promote the welfare and\r\nhappiness of its citizens. For this purpose, it must provide for making\r\nand properly administering laws to protect the people in the enjoyment\r\nof life and the fruits of their labor. But it should go further, and\r\nmake express provision for improving the condition of the people,\r\nespecially the less fortunate portions of them.\r\n\r\n§2. The prosperity of a state or nation depends essentially upon the\r\neducation of its citizens. This is seen by comparing the condition of\r\nthe people of this country with the condition of the people of those\r\ncountries where the benefits of education are not enjoyed. Ignorance\r\ntends to make men idle, vicious, and miserable. On the other hand,\r\nlearning is not only a means of enjoyment in itself, but of improving\r\nthe social condition of a people.\r\n\r\n§3. Again, a free government is better adapted than any other to promote\r\nthe welfare of a nation. But if the people are not properly educated,\r\nthey are incapable of self-government. And as many persons are unable to\r\npay for the tuition of their children, the safety of the government\r\nitself requires the establishment of a system of education, by which the\r\ngreat body of the people may be fitted to discharge their social and\r\npolitical duties. The states have accordingly instituted school systems\r\nfor the instruction of children and youth of all classes at the public\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\n§4. In most of the states, the schools are supported only in part, in a\r\nfew of them wholly, at the expense of the states. Some states have\r\nprovided funds, the income of which is annually applied to this object.\r\n_Fund_ generally signifies the money or capital stock employed in\r\ncarrying on trade or any other business operation. _State funds_ are the\r\nmoneys and other property of the state which are set apart for paying\r\nthe expenses of the government, or for the construction of canals,\r\nroads, and other public improvements. The interest of these funds, and\r\nthe income from other sources, are called the _revenue_.\r\n\r\n§5. In some states, school funds are created by appropriating the public\r\nlands, which are lands owned by the state as a body corporate. The\r\nproceeds of these lands, from sales or rents, constitute a part or the\r\nwhole of the school fund, the interest of which is annually applied to\r\nthe support of schools. If the income from the school fund is\r\ninsufficient for this purpose, the deficiency may, as is done in some\r\nstates, be supplied, in whole or in part, by taxation, or from the state\r\ntreasury.\r\n\r\n§6. Many of the new states have large school funds. At an early period,\r\nwhile most of the territory from which these states have been formed was\r\nyet the property of the United States, and uninhabited, Congress passed\r\nan act by which a particular section of land (number sixteen) in every\r\ntownship is reserved for the support of schools therein. By this act,\r\none thirty-sixth part of the lands within each of these states has been\r\nthus appropriated, besides smaller portions granted for the benefit of a\r\nuniversity in each state. These lands are in the charge of proper\r\nofficers, who dispose of them, and apply the proceeds as the law\r\ndirects.\r\n\r\n§7. The school funds of many of the states have been largely increased\r\nby certain moneys received from the United States. In 1837, there had\r\naccumulated in the national treasury about thirty millions of dollars\r\nover and above what was needed for the support of the government. By an\r\nact of congress, this surplus revenue was distributed among the states\r\nthen existing, to be kept by them until called for by congress. Although\r\ncongress reserved the right to recall the money, it was presumed that it\r\nwould never be demanded. That it never will be, is now almost certain.\r\nMany of the states have appropriated large portions of their respective\r\nshares for school purposes. From its having been said to be only\r\n_deposited_ with the states, this fund is sometimes called the _United\r\nStates deposit fund_.\r\n\r\n§8. School moneys coming from the state treasury, or state fund, are\r\nusually apportioned among the several towns of the state; and each\r\ntown's share of such moneys, together with what may come to the town by\r\ntaxation or from its school lands, is divided among the several\r\ndistricts according to the number of children between certain ages in\r\neach district, or in such other manner as may be directed by law. If the\r\nmoneys thus received are insufficient to pay the wages of teachers, a\r\nrate bill is made out in each district for the deficiency, and collected\r\nfrom the persons whose children have been taught in the schools.\r\n\r\n§9. The towns, or townships, are divided into districts of suitable size\r\nfor schools, which are called _district schools_. From their being\r\nsupported by a common fund, and designed for the common benefit, or from\r\nthe lower or more common branches being taught in them, they are also\r\ncalled _common schools_. One or more _trustees_ or _directors_ are\r\nchosen in each district to manage its affairs; a _clerk_ to notify\r\nmeetings and record the proceedings of the same; and a _collector_ to\r\ncollect taxes for building and repairing school-houses, and all rate\r\nbills for the payment of teachers.\r\n\r\n§10. The highest school officer is the _state superintendent of common\r\nschools_, or, as he is sometimes called, _superintendent of public\r\ninstruction_. The superintendent collects information relating to the\r\nschools; the number of children residing in each district, and the\r\nnumber taught; the amount paid for tuition; the number of school-houses,\r\nand the amount yearly expended in erecting school-houses; and other\r\nmatters concerning the operation and effects of the common school\r\nsystem. If there is no other officer whose duty it is, the\r\nsuperintendent also apportions the money arising from the state funds\r\namong the several counties. He reports to the legislature at every\r\nsession the information he has collected, and suggests such improvements\r\nin the school system as he thinks ought to be made.\r\n\r\n§11. There is in every county an officer who receives from the state\r\nsuperintendent the money apportioned to the county, and apportions the\r\nsame among the towns; reports to the state superintendent the number of\r\nchildren in the county; and performs such other duties as the law\r\nrequires. In some states, there is no such county officer; but the money\r\nis apportioned by the state superintendent among the towns; and the\r\nreports from the towns are made directly to the state superintendent.\r\n\r\n§12. In the towns are officers whose duties are to examine teachers,\r\nvisit schools, apportion the school moneys among the districts, and to\r\ncollect the lists of the number of children in the several districts,\r\nwith such other information as the law requires, and report the same to\r\nthe county officer, or, if there is none, to the state superintendent.\r\nIn some states, there is in each county an officer or a board of\r\nofficers, for examining teachers, and performing certain other duties\r\nrelating to the schools of the county.\r\n\r\n§13. Academies and colleges also receive aid from the state, to a\r\nlimited extent. A distinct fund is created in some states for their\r\nbenefit; in others, they are aided by special appropriations from the\r\nstate treasury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIII.\r\n\r\nCanals and Rail-Roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. In carrying out the purposes of government, provision ought also to\r\nbe made to secure to the people the means of obtaining a suitable reward\r\nfor their industry, and to render the labor of all, as nearly as may be,\r\nequally profitable.\r\n\r\n§2. The people of some states do not possess the same advantage as those\r\nof others; nor do all the people of the same state enjoy equal\r\nadvantages. Those who reside at a great distance from market, or from\r\nnavigable waters and good roads, are not so well rewarded for their\r\nlabor as those who reside near them, because of the greater cost of the\r\ntransportation, both of what they have to sell, and of the goods they\r\nbuy. Hence the necessity of good roads, canals, or other means of\r\nfacilitating trade between the different parts of the state.\r\n\r\n§3. Among the works intended to effect this object, _canals_ are perhaps\r\nthe most useful, and are to be preferred wherever their construction is\r\npracticable. Canals are sometimes constructed by incorporated companies;\r\nbut generally these works, especially those of great magnitude, are made\r\nby the state, and are the property of the state. Although there are some\r\nstates in which are no canals of this kind, it may be interesting to\r\nyoung persons generally to know how so important a state work is made.\r\n\r\n§4. To raise the money necessary to make a canal, the legislature might\r\nlevy a general tax upon the property of the citizens. But this would not\r\nbe expedient or just; because, first, the payment of so large a sum by\r\nthe people within the time in which it would be desirable to complete\r\nthe work, would be inconvenient and burdensome; and secondly, the\r\nexpense must fall alike upon the people of all parts of the state:\r\nwhereas, those residing most remotely from the line of the work, would\r\nderive from it little or no benefit.\r\n\r\n§5. When, therefore, a great enterprise of this kind is undertaken by a\r\nstate, the law authorizing the work usually provides a _fund_, the\r\nincome of which is to be applied to this object. This fund consists of\r\nsuch lands, property, and moneys as the legislature may grant for this\r\npurpose. Funds were thus constituted in some of the western states, to\r\nwhich funds congress made grants of the public lands of the United\r\nStates lying within those states.\r\n\r\n§6. These funds, however, furnish but a part, some of them but a small\r\nportion of the money necessary to complete the work; and some states\r\nundertaking public improvements may not have the lands or other property\r\nto constitute such a fund. The state therefore borrows the money for a\r\nlong term of years, and depends upon the income of the canal fund and\r\nthe tolls to be collected on the canals, for the repayment of the money\r\nborrowed. Should the revenues of the canal and of the canal fund be\r\ninsufficient, the deficiency may be supplied by taxation.\r\n\r\n§7. The business of borrowing the money is done on the part of the\r\nstate, by persons duly authorized, who give for the money borrowed the\r\nbonds of the state, which are written promises to pay the money at the\r\ntimes specified, with interest at the rate agreed on; the interest\r\ngenerally to be paid semi-annually. These bonds are usually given in\r\nsums of $1,000 each, or less. The debts of a state thus contracted by\r\nissuing bonds, are called _state stocks_, as the capital, or stock\r\nrequired to construct a state work is obtained by the sale of its bonds.\r\nThese bonds, like the certificates of stock in a rail-road or other\r\ncorporate business company, are transferable, and may be bought and sold\r\nas promissory notes, and constitute an important article of trade.\r\n\r\n§8. These stocks are taken by men who have large sums of money to lend,\r\nand who consider the state a responsible debtor; because, if it has no\r\nother sufficient means of paying its bonds, the legislature has power to\r\nraise the money by taxation. Most of the states have contracted debts in\r\nthis manner for various purposes. State stocks are purchased and held\r\nnot only by capitalists in this country, but by many in Europe.\r\n\r\n§9. Officers are appointed to manage the canal fund, and others to\r\nsuperintend the canals. There are also officers, called _canal\r\ncollectors_, at suitable distances along the canals, to collect the\r\n_tolls_, which are charges paid by the masters or owners of boats for\r\nthe use of the canal.\r\n\r\n§10. The states of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and some other western\r\nstates, have prosecuted the canal enterprise on a large scale. Although\r\nlarge debts have been contracted for the construction of canals in these\r\nstates, the benefits derived from them more than compensate for the vast\r\nexpense of their construction.\r\n\r\n§11. _Rail-roads_, although they are of public utility, are not\r\nproperly public works, being constructed by companies incorporated for\r\nthat purpose. The necessity for an act of incorporation is readily seen.\r\nRail-roads pass through the lands of private individuals; and without\r\nthe authority of law, the land of no person can be taken for such\r\npurpose; nor can a law authorize it to be taken, unless the work is one\r\nof general advantage; nor even in such case, without compensation to the\r\nowner for his land; for it is declared by the state constitutions, that\r\n\"private property shall not be taken for public use without just\r\ncompensation.\"\r\n\r\n§12. If, therefore, the legislature deem a proposed railroad to be of\r\npublic utility, they pass an act to incorporate a company with the\r\nrequisite powers to construct the road, on making compensation for the\r\nland, the value of which is to be estimated in such manner as the law\r\nprescribes. The law also prescribes the manner in which the affairs of\r\nthe road are to be conducted.\r\n\r\n§13. The amount of capital to be employed by the company, is mentioned\r\nin the act of incorporation, or charter, and is raised in this way: The\r\namount of the capital, or stock, is divided into shares of $100, or\r\nless. Persons wishing to invest money in the road, subscribe the number\r\nof shares they will respectively take. When all the shares are thus sold\r\nand the money is paid in, the company is ready to proceed to the\r\nconstruction of the road. The owners of these shares are called\r\n_stockholders_, who choose from among themselves such number of\r\n_directors_ as the charter authorizes. The directors elect from their\r\nnumber a _president_.\r\n\r\n§14. Persons buying shares receive certificates signed by the proper\r\nofficers, stating the number of shares for which each certificate is\r\ngiven. The holders of these certificates, if they wish to make other use\r\nof the money they have invested in the business, may sell their stock to\r\nothers, to whom they pass their certificates, which are evidence of the\r\namount of stock purchased. Thus these certificates are bought and sold\r\nas promissory notes.\r\n\r\n§15. Stockholders depend, for the reimbursement of their capital, upon\r\nthe money to be received for the transportation of passengers and\r\nfreight. Such portion of the income of the road as remains after paying\r\nall expenses of running and repairs, is divided semi-annually among the\r\nstockholders. Hence the sums thus divided are called _dividends_. The\r\nearnings of some roads are so large as to make the investment a\r\nprofitable one; so that the holder of shares is enabled to sell them at\r\nan advance. When shares in the stock of any institution are sold at\r\ntheir nominal value, the price named in the certificates, the stock is\r\nsaid to be at _par_. When they are sold for more or less than their\r\nnominal value, they are said to be above or below _par_. In large\r\ncommercial cities, as New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and others, the\r\npurchase and sale of state stocks, and stocks in rail-roads, banks, &c.,\r\nis a regular and extensive business of capitalists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIV.\r\n\r\nBanks and Insurance Companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. Banks, we are told, were first instituted in Italy, where certain\r\nJews assembled, seated on benches, ready to lend money, and to exchange\r\nmoney and bills; and _banco_ being the Italian name for bench, banks\r\ntook their title from this word. The first banks are said to have been\r\nonly places where money was laid up or deposited for safe-keeping. But\r\nbanks at the present day are not used for depositing alone.\r\n\r\n§2. Banks in this country can be established only by authority of law.\r\nThey are incorporated by an act of the legislature. The capital stock is\r\nraised by the sale of shares, and issue of certificates, as in the case\r\nof rail-roads. (Chap. XXIII., §13.) The stockholders elect of their\r\nnumber (usually) thirteen _directors_, who choose one of themselves as\r\n_president_. The president and directors choose a cashier and clerks.\r\n\r\n§3. Merchants and others in commercial places, deposit in banks, for\r\nsafe-keeping, the money they receive in the course of business, and then\r\ndraw it out on their written orders as they have occasion to use it. An\r\norder of this kind is called a _check_.\r\n\r\n§4. Persons depositing money only once, or very seldom, and intending to\r\ndraw for the same at once, usually receive from the cashier a\r\n_certificate of deposit_, which states the name of the depositor, the\r\nsum deposited, and to whose order it is to be paid. For the use of money\r\ndeposited for any considerable period, banks agree to pay interest,\r\nusually less, however, than the rate established by law. Certificates of\r\ndeposit may, by indorsement, be made transferable as promissory notes\r\nand other negotiable paper, (Chap. LX., §2,) and are often remitted,\r\ninstead of money, to distant places, where, by presenting them at a\r\nbank, they may, for a trifling compensation, be converted into money.\r\n\r\n§5. A material part of the business of banks is to assist merchants and\r\nothers in transmitting money to distant places. Thus: A, in New York,\r\nwishing to send $1,000 to B, in Philadelphia, puts the money into a bank\r\nin New York, takes for it an order, called _draft_, on a bank in\r\nPhiladelphia, for that amount, to be paid to B. The draft is sent by\r\nmail to B, who presents his draft at the bank, and receives the money;\r\nand the bank charges the amount to the New York bank.\r\n\r\n§6. But persons unacquainted with commercial business, especially young\r\npersons, may not know how the bank in Philadelphia is to be repaid. In\r\nthe course of trade between the two cities, business men are constantly\r\nremitting money both ways through the banks, which thus receive the\r\nmoney and draw upon each other. Thus millions of dollars may be annually\r\ntransmitted between the two cities, without any expense except the small\r\ncharge of the banks for doing the business, and without the risk of loss\r\nby accident or robbery which attends the conveyance of money in person.\r\n\r\n§7. Banks also lend money. The borrower gives a note for the sum\r\nwanted, signed by himself, and indorsed by one or more others as\r\nsureties. The cashier pays the money for the note, retaining out of it\r\nthe interest on the sum lent, instead of waiting for it until the note\r\nbecomes due. This is called _discounting_ a note.\r\n\r\n§8. The bills of banks pass as money. A bank bill or note is a promise\r\nof the bank to pay the bearer a certain sum on demand, signed by the\r\npresident and cashier. It passes as money, because the bank is bound to\r\npay it in specie if it is demanded. Paying notes thus is _redeeming_\r\nthem. When a bank is unable to redeem all its bills, it is said to have\r\nfailed, or to be broken; and the bill holders suffer loss, unless some\r\nsecurity has been provided. This has been done in some states by making\r\nthe stockholders individually liable for the redemption of the bills;\r\nthat is, the property owned by them as individuals may be taken and sold\r\non execution for that purpose. Such security, however, has never been\r\ngenerally provided.\r\n\r\n§9. But a system of banking, sometimes called _free banking_, has more\r\nrecently been adopted in some states. It is so called, because the\r\nbusiness of banking is thrown open to all by a _general law_. Any\r\nperson, or any number of persons, may, by complying with the provisions\r\nof this general law, establish a bank without a special law for this\r\npurpose. Hence it is also called the _general banking_ system.\r\n\r\n§10. Persons, before commencing business under this law, must put into\r\nthe hands of the proper state officers ample securities for the\r\nredemption of their bills; and they may not issue bills to a greater\r\namount than the amount of their securities. These securities must\r\nconsist of approved state stocks, or United States stocks, or partly of\r\npublic stocks, and partly of real estate. When a bank fails, the lands\r\nand stocks held in pledge by the state are sold, and the avails are\r\napplied to the redemption of the bills. This system of banking seems to\r\nbe growing into public favor.\r\n\r\n§11. _Insurance companies_ also are authorized by law. Their business is\r\nto insure persons against loss by fire. The corporators, on being paid a\r\nsmall sum, consisting generally of a certain percentage on the amount\r\nfor which the property is insured, promise to pay such amount if the\r\nproperty shall be destroyed by fire. There are companies also for\r\ninsuring vessels at sea; and _life_ insurance companies, that agree to\r\npay, in case of the death of the person insured, a certain sum for the\r\nbenefit of his family, or of some other person named in the policy. The\r\nword _policy_ as here used, means the writing containing the terms or\r\nconditions on which the company agrees to indemnify the person insured\r\nin case of loss. The money paid to obtain insurance, is called\r\n_premium_.\r\n\r\n§12. The profits of the stockholders consist of the excess of money\r\nreceived for premiums over the amount paid out for losses. Thus, if a\r\ncompany has issued 2,000 policies, each covering property of an average\r\namount of $1,000, the amount of risk is $2,000,000; and if the rate of\r\ninsurance is one per cent., the amount received in premiums is $20,000.\r\nHence, if none of the 2,000 buildings is burned within the time the\r\ninsurance is to run, the $20,000 are gained. If ten of them should be\r\nburned, there would still be a gain of $10,000. If twenty should be\r\ndestroyed, there would be no gain, but an actual loss to the amount of\r\nthe expenses of the concern.\r\n\r\n§13. But from the average number and amount of losses annually for many\r\nyears, companies are enabled so to fix the rates of insurance as to give\r\nthe stockholders a fair profit on their capital. The rates are not the\r\nsame on all kinds of property; a higher per centage is charged on that\r\nwhich is deemed hazardous, or more exposed to fire, than on that which\r\nis less exposed. The profits on the business of the company, or the\r\n_dividends_, as they are called, are annually or semi-annually divided\r\namong the stockholders, in proportion to the amount of their respective\r\nshares.\r\n\r\n§14. There is another kind of insurance companies, which differ\r\nmaterially from the _stock_ companies described in the preceding\r\nsections. They are _mutual_ insurance companies. They are so called\r\nbecause the members unite in insuring each other. Every person having\r\nhis property insured by such a company is a member of it. He has his\r\nbuildings and the property in them valued; and pays a certain rate per\r\ncent. on such valuation. A fund is thus raised out of which any member\r\nsuffering loss by fire is paid the amount for which the property was\r\ninsured. When the fund is exhausted, it is again supplied by a tax\r\nassessed upon the members in proportion to the amounts for which they\r\nare respectively insured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXV.\r\n\r\nThe Militia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. It is the practice of governments to keep their respective countries\r\nprepared to defend themselves against foreign enemies. For this purpose\r\nall men liable to do military duty are enrolled, and are required to\r\nmeet on certain days every year for instruction in the art of war, in\r\norder to be ready for actual service whenever it shall be required. The\r\nbody of soldiers thus enrolled are called the _militia_. There are other\r\nwords which are sometimes applied to bodies of soldiers; as _infantry_,\r\nwhich means the soldiers or troops who serve on foot; _cavalry_, the\r\ntroops on horses; _artillery_, those who manage the cannon and other\r\nheavy weapons of war. But all troops are comprehended in the general\r\nterm, _militia_.\r\n\r\n§2. The militia of a state, or a portion of them, may also be needed to\r\naid in executing the laws of the state, and in suppressing insurrection\r\nor rebellion. An _insurrection_ is a rising against the public\r\nauthority, or the attempt of persons to prevent the execution of a law.\r\n_Rebellion_ generally means nearly the same as _insurrection_; but more\r\nproperly it signifies a revolt, or an attempt to overthrow the\r\ngovernment to establish a different one. As it is the duty of an\r\nexecutive to see the laws executed, power is given by the constitution\r\nto the governor to call out a sufficient military force for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n§3. All able-bodied white male citizens of the United States, between\r\nthe ages of eighteen and forty-five years, are liable to perform\r\nmilitary service in the states in which they reside, except such as are\r\nexempt by the laws of the states and of the United States. Persons\r\nexempt by the laws of the states are generally the following: Ministers\r\nof the gospel; commissioned officers of the militia having served a\r\ncertain number of years; members of uniformed companies having served\r\nfor a specified time; members of fire companies; certain public officers\r\nwhile in office; and in some states teachers and students of colleges,\r\nacademies, and common schools; and a few others.\r\n\r\n§4. Persons exempt by the laws of the United States are the\r\nvice-president, the subordinate executive and all the judicial officers\r\nof the government of the United States; members of congress and its\r\nofficers; custom-house officers and their clerks; post-officers and\r\ndrivers of mail stages; ferrymen employed at ferries on post-roads;\r\npilots and mariners.\r\n\r\n§5. By the constitutions of the several states, the governors are made\r\nthe commanders-in-chief of the militia of their respective states; and\r\nby the constitution of the United States, the president is made\r\ncommander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States, and also\r\nof the militia of the states when called out into actual service. It has\r\nalready been remarked, (§2,) that the military force of the state is at\r\nthe command of the executive to protect the government and its citizens.\r\nSo the president was thought the proper person to have command of the\r\npublic forces, to execute the laws of the United States, to repel\r\ninvasion, and to carry on war. Hence the governors and the president are\r\nnot among the public officers who are exempt from military duty.\r\n\r\n§6. Persons who, having been duly notified, refuse to appear at\r\nmilitary parades, or, appearing without being equipped as the law\r\ndirects, are tried by a military court, called _court martial_,\r\nconsisting usually of three military officers, or of such other persons\r\nas may be appointed according to the law of the state. If the persons\r\ntried do not show good cause for their delinquency, they are fined in\r\nsuch sums as the law prescribes. In certain cases courts may consist of\r\nmore than three members.\r\n\r\n§7. The highest militia officer, except the governor, is the\r\n_adjutant-general_ of the state; who keeps a list of all the higher\r\ncommissioned officers, containing the dates of their commissions, their\r\nrank, the corps (pronounced _core_) they belong to, the division,\r\nbrigade, and regiment, and their places of residence. He distributes all\r\norders from the commander-in-chief (the governor,) to the several\r\ndivisions; attends public reviews where the commander-in-chief reviews\r\nthe militia; and obeys all orders from him relative to carrying into\r\nexecution the system of military discipline established by law.\r\n\r\n§8. There is also in some states a _commissary-general_, who has the\r\ncare of the arsenals and magazines, and the articles deposited in them.\r\nAn _arsenal_ is a building in which are kept cannon, muskets, powder,\r\nballs, and other warlike stores; all of which are to be kept in repair\r\nand ready for use.\r\n\r\n§9. There are persons who, believing all wars to be wrong, can not\r\nconscientiously do military service. As it is the object of our\r\ngovernment to secure to every person the liberty of conscience as well\r\nas other rights, the constitutions of many of the states provide, that\r\nthose who are averse to bearing arms, may be excused by paying annually\r\na sum of money instead of rendering the service. But it may well be\r\ndoubted whether compelling a man to pay the money is not itself a\r\nviolation of the right of conscience. Many persons conceive it to be no\r\nless morally wrong to commute for the service than to perform it. In\r\nsome states, all persons belonging to the society of Friends, usually\r\ncalled Quakers, are exempt without the payment of an equivalent in\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n§10. In the states of New York and Ohio, the rank and file of the\r\nmilitia are not required to train in time of peace. Persons liable to\r\nperform military service, except those connected with the uniformed\r\ncompanies, are enrolled in the militia; but instead of doing duty, they\r\npay annually a small tax, which is in New York fifty cents, and in Ohio\r\nfifty cents, or a day's highway labor.\r\n\r\n§11. Laws abolishing trainings and musters of the great body of the\r\nmilitia, are, it is believed, growing into favor, and for these among\r\nother reasons: First, the militia system produces no material\r\nimprovement in discipline; secondly, the expenditure of time and money\r\nin these useless exercises, and for arms and equipments, are burdensome\r\nto many citizens; and thirdly, there is no probability of an occasion\r\nrequiring a large portion of the militia to be so suddenly called into\r\nservice as to allow no time for preparation. Volunteer companies like\r\nthose kept up and disciplined in the states above named, and the\r\nstanding army of the nation, are deemed sufficient for any supposable\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\n§12. Happily the practice of settling disputes between nations by war,\r\nis becoming less popular in civilized and Christian communities. War is\r\na dreadful evil, and ought to be discouraged, and, if possible, avoided.\r\nWere governments so disposed, they might in most cases settle their\r\ndifferences as individuals do, by submitting them to the judgment of a\r\nthird party. If the love of military honor were less encouraged, and the\r\nprinciples of peace duly inculcated, the time would be hastened when\r\n\"nations shall learn war no more.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVI.\r\n\r\nCauses of the Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. The plan of government in this country is peculiar. To a person\r\npreviously unacquainted with our political institutions, it might seem\r\nstrange, after having read the foregoing description of the state\r\ngovernments, to be told that there is still another and a different\r\ngovernment to which the people are subject. How the people of more than\r\nthirty states, all having complete and distinct governments, can at the\r\nsame time be subject to another government, also complete in all its\r\nparts, he would not immediately understand. He would not know what is\r\nmeant by the government of the United States. How the states, all having\r\ngovernments of their own, can be _united_ in one government, he would\r\nnot readily perceive.\r\n\r\n§2. We shall therefore proceed to a description of the government of the\r\nUnited States, from which will appear the relation between that\r\ngovernment and the state governments. It will also appear that the state\r\ngovernments, each of which has in itself a great deal of machinery, all\r\nmove in harmony with the great political machine--the government of the\r\nUnited States. It is easy to see that a knowledge of these governments\r\nis important to the people who live under them, as every freeman\r\nexercises a part of the governing power, both in the government of his\r\nown state, and in the general government.\r\n\r\n§3. To assist the reader in understanding the constitution and\r\ngovernment of the United States, we shall first give a sketch of the\r\ngovernments which preceded, and of the principal causes which led to the\r\nrevolution in the government of this country. Most of the youth who are\r\nof sufficient age to study this work, probably know that our present\r\nforms of government were not established by the early settlers in this\r\ncountry. The first inhabitants were _colonists_. A _colony_ is a\r\nsettlement of persons in a distant place or country, who remain subject\r\nto the government of the state or country from which they removed. The\r\nAmerican colonies which have become the \"United States,\" were chiefly\r\nsettled from Great Britain, and were under her jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n§4. The political rights and privileges enjoyed by the colonists as\r\nBritish subjects, were very limited, and were conferred by the charters\r\nof the king. The people had not then, as now, constitutions of their own\r\nchoice. There were colonial governments; but they were such as the king\r\nwas pleased to establish, and might be changed at his pleasure. These\r\ngovernments were in _form_ somewhat similar to that of our state\r\ngovernments. There was what might be called a legislature; also an\r\nexecutive or governor; and there were judges.\r\n\r\n§5. But of the officers of these departments of the government, only the\r\nmembers of one branch of the law-making power were elected by the\r\npeople. The other branch was composed of a small number of men, called a\r\ncouncil; but they were appointed by the king and subject to his control,\r\nas was also the governor, who had the power of an absolute negative or\r\nveto to any proposed law. And laws after having received the assent of\r\nthe governor, must be sent to England and approved by the king, before\r\nthey could go into effect.\r\n\r\n§6. Hence we see that the colonists had no security for the passage of\r\nsuch laws as they wanted. And the consequence was, that they were often\r\ndenied good and wholesome laws, by the refusal of the king to sanction\r\nthem. Not only so; many laws enacted by parliament were very unjust and\r\noppressive. The object of these laws was to secure to Great Britain\r\nalone the trade of the colonies. One law declared that no goods should\r\nbe imported by the colonists but in English vessels; if brought in\r\nother vessels, both the goods and vessels were to be forfeited to the\r\nBritish government.\r\n\r\n§7. Another law required such articles as England wanted, to be\r\ntransported to that country and other countries belonging to Great\r\nBritain. The colonists were permitted to ship to foreign markets such\r\nproducts only as English merchants did not want. They were prohibited\r\nfrom selling abroad any wool, yarn, or woolen manufactured goods. This\r\nwas done to keep the markets open for British wool and manufactures.\r\nAnother law declared that no iron wares of any kind should be\r\nmanufactured here. Thus was it attempted to suppress manufactures in the\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\n§8. Hence we see that it was the policy of the British government to\r\ncompel the colonists to buy of England all the goods they wanted which\r\nthey did not themselves produce, and to sell to England the surplus\r\nproductions of the colonies. For this purpose, heavy duties were laid\r\nupon goods imported into the colonies from other countries than Great\r\nBritain and her possessions. These duties were taxes levied upon goods\r\nbrought into the colonies from abroad, and were collected by officers\r\nhere from the persons importing the goods.\r\n\r\n§9. The following facts will explain to the young reader more clearly\r\nthe nature and effects of these duties: The colonists traded with the\r\nWest India islands, some of which belonged to Great Britain, some to\r\nFrance, and some to Spain. To secure the whole trade, the British\r\ngovernment imposed high duties upon the molasses, sugar and other\r\narticles imported into the colonies from the French and Spanish islands.\r\nThe people of the colonies could therefore avoid the payment of these\r\nduties only by importing the above mentioned goods from the British\r\nislands.\r\n\r\n§10. Not satisfied with these acts, parliament claimed the right to tax\r\nthe colonies, \"in all cases whatsoever;\" and an act was passed\r\naccordingly, laying duties upon all tea, glass, paper, &c., imported\r\ninto the colonies; and the money thus collected was put into the British\r\ntreasury. The colonists petitioned the king and parliament to repeal\r\nthese obnoxious laws; but their petitions were denied. Having given up\r\nall hope of relief, congress, which was a body of delegates from the\r\nseveral colonies, declared the colonies to be free and independent\r\nstates, no longer subject to the government of Great Britain. This\r\ndeclaration was maintained by a war which lasted about seven years, when\r\nGreat Britain gave up the contest, and acknowledged the independence of\r\nthe states; and the _revolution_ was accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVII.\r\n\r\nNature of the Union under the Confederation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. As early as the year 1774, the colonies united in the plan of a\r\ncongress, to be composed of delegates chosen in all the colonies, for\r\nthe purpose of consulting on the common good and of adopting measures of\r\nresistance to the claims of the British government. The first great\r\ncontinental congress met on the 4th of September, 1774. Another congress\r\nassembled in May, 1775. This congress adopted sundry measures having\r\nreference to war, and finally made the declaration of independence, July\r\n4th, 1776. The continental congress, the members of which were chosen by\r\nthe state legislatures, conducted the affairs of the nation until near\r\nthe close of the war.\r\n\r\n§2. With a view to a permanent union of the colonies under a general\r\ngovernment, the congress, in November, 1777, agreed upon a frame of\r\ngovernment, contained in certain articles, called, \"Articles of\r\nConfederation and perpetual Union between the States.\" These articles\r\nwere to go into effect when they should have received the assent of all\r\nthe states. But as the consent of the last state (Maryland) was not\r\nobtained until March, 1781, they went into operation only about two\r\nyears before the close of the war.\r\n\r\n§3. As a plan of national government, the confederation was soon found\r\nto be very defective. The union formed under it was a very imperfect\r\none. Having been framed in time of war, it had respect to the operations\r\nof war rather than to a state of peace. Although it answered some good\r\npurpose in carrying on the war, it was not well adapted oven to the\r\ncondition of the country then existing. Its defects appeared almost as\r\nsoon as it went into effect; and after the return of peace, it was found\r\nthat the union, instead of being strengthened and perpetuated by it,\r\ncould be preserved only by a radical change in the system of government.\r\n\r\n§4. The leading defect of the confederation was its weakness. Congress\r\ncould do little more than to recommend measures. As it could not\r\nlegislate directly upon persons, its measures were to be carried into\r\neffect by the states; but the states were not in all cases willing, and\r\nsome of them did at times refuse to do so, and congress could not compel\r\nthem. It belonged to congress to determine the number of troops and the\r\nsums of money necessary to carry on the war, and to call on each state\r\nto raise its share; but congress could not enforce its demands. It\r\nborrowed money in its own name, but it had not the means of paying it.\r\nIt had no power to lay and collect taxes; this power was reserved to the\r\nstates.\r\n\r\n§5. Hence we see that congress was dependent for every thing upon the\r\ngood will of thirteen independent states. It is a wonder that a\r\ngovernment of such inherent weakness should bring the war to a\r\nsuccessful issue. It was a sense of danger from abroad, rather than any\r\npower in the government, that induced a sufficient compliance with the\r\nordinances of congress to achieve the independence of the states.\r\n\r\n§6. On the restoration of peace, new difficulties arose. We have already\r\nspoken of the want of power in congress to lay and collect taxes for\r\nwar purposes. Money was now wanted to discharge the public debt, and to\r\npay the current expenses of the government; yet congress had no power to\r\nraise it, either by a _direct tax_ upon the persons or property of the\r\ncitizens, or _indirectly_ by duties on goods imported, as at present\r\nunder the constitution. The power to lay and collect duties was with the\r\nstates; but it was of little use so long as each state could impose such\r\nduties as it chose. The states being unable to agree upon a uniform rate\r\nof duties, the goods would be imported into states which levied the\r\nlowest duties. It was expedient, if it had been possible, to borrow more\r\nmoney on the credit of the union, as the heavy debt contracted during\r\nthe war remained unpaid, and congress had no means of paying it.\r\n\r\n§7. But the inability to raise money was not the only difficulty that\r\nattended the want of power by congress to lay duties. This power was\r\nnecessary also to regulate the foreign trade. We have already remarked,\r\nthat it was the policy of Great Britain before the revolution to secure\r\nin the colonies a market for her manufactures. (Chap. XXVI.) Not only\r\nso; she had by her navigation acts, for more than a hundred years,\r\nimposed heavy duties upon foreign vessels coming into her ports, in\r\norder to secure the carrying trade to her own shipping. In addition to\r\nthis, she also levied high duties upon the produce of the states sent to\r\npay for the goods we were obliged to buy of her, our own people not\r\nhaving as yet the means, nor having had time, to establish\r\nmanufactories, and to manufacture for themselves.\r\n\r\n§8. Another of the numerous troubles which arose from this imperfect\r\nunion was the want of peace and harmony between the states. Laws were\r\nenacted in some states with a view to their own interests, which\r\noperated injuriously upon other states. This induced the latter states\r\nto retaliate, by passing laws partial to themselves and injurious to the\r\nformer. The states soon became disaffected toward each other; and their\r\nmutual jealousies and rivalries and animosities at length became so\r\ngreat as to cause fears that some of the states would become involved\r\nin war among themselves, and that the union would be broken up.\r\n\r\n§9. In the hope of remedying the difficulty last mentioned, an attempt\r\nwas made to procure the insertion, into the articles of confederation,\r\nof a provision giving to congress the power to regulate trade; but the\r\nattempt failed. In January, 1786, the legislature of Virginia proposed a\r\nconvention of commissioners from all the states, to take into\r\nconsideration the situation and trade of the United States, and the\r\nnecessity of a uniform system of commercial regulations.\r\n\r\n§10. A meeting was accordingly held at Annapolis, in September, 1786;\r\nbut as commissioners from only five states attended, viz., New York, New\r\nJersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Virginia, the commissioners deemed\r\nit unadvisable to proceed to business relating to an object in which all\r\nthe states were concerned; but they united in a report to the several\r\nstates and to congress, in which they recommended the calling of a\r\ngeneral convention of delegates from all the states, to meet in\r\nPhiladelphia on the 2d Monday of May, 1787, with a view not only to the\r\nregulation of commerce, but to such other amendments of the articles of\r\nconfederation as were necessary to render them \"adequate to the\r\nexigencies of the union.\"\r\n\r\n§11. In pursuance of this recommendation, congress, in February, 1787,\r\npassed a resolution for assembling a convention. All the states, except\r\nRhode Island, appointed delegates, who met pursuant to appointment; and\r\nframed the present constitution of the United States. They also\r\nrecommended it to be laid by congress before the several states, to be\r\nby them considered and ratified in conventions of representatives of the\r\npeople. Conventions were accordingly called for this purpose in all the\r\nstates, except Rhode Island, and the constitution was ratified by all of\r\nthem in which conventions had been called, except North Carolina.\r\n\r\n§12. The constitution was to go into effect if ratified by nine states.\r\nThe ninth state, New Hampshire, sent its ratification to congress in\r\nJuly, 1788; and measures were taken by congress to put the new\r\nconstitution into operation. Ratifications were received from North\r\nCarolina and Rhode Island the year after the organization of the new\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVIII.\r\n\r\nNature of the Union under the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. Having given, in the preceding chapter, a sketch of the union under\r\nthe confederation, we shall next show the nature of the union under the\r\npresent constitution, commencing with a brief comparison of the leading\r\nfeatures of the two systems of government.\r\n\r\n§2. The former union was a mere confederacy. A _confederacy_ is a\r\nleague, a federal compact. The word _federal_ is from the Latin _fadus_,\r\na league, or alliance. Hence a confederacy is a combination or union of\r\ntwo or more parties, whether persons or states, for their mutual benefit\r\nand assistance. And let it be here particularly noted, that this union\r\nwas a union of states, _as states_. The articles of confederation were\r\nframed by congress, whose members were appointed by the state\r\nlegislatures, and, when framed, were submitted to the state legislatures\r\nfor ratification.\r\n\r\n§3. On the other hand, the union under the constitution is a union, not\r\nof the states, as such, but of the _people of the states_. Thus it is\r\nexpressed in the preamble to the constitution: \"We, the people of the\r\nUnited States, in order to form a more perfect union, ... do ordain and\r\nestablish this constitution for the United States of America.\" And the\r\nconstitution was submitted for ratification, not to the state\r\nlegislatures, but to conventions whose members were elected by the\r\npeople for that purpose.\r\n\r\n§4. The states under the confederation were independent, not only of\r\neach other, but of the general government. True, they agreed, for their\r\ncommon defense and mutual welfare, to do certain things; and certain\r\nother things they agreed not to do, but delegated to congress the power\r\nto do them; but, as we have seen, congress had not the power to compel\r\nthe states to obey its requisitions. By the constitution, the states\r\nhave given up a greater portion of their sovereignty to the general\r\ngovernment, which has power, in certain cases, to control the state\r\ngovernments, and to enforce its laws upon them and upon individuals.\r\n\r\n§5. Again, under the confederation, as in confederacies generally, the\r\nstates were equal. They were entitled to an equal number of delegates in\r\nthe congress, in which they voted by states, each state having one vote;\r\nthat is, if a majority of the delegates of a state voted in favor of or\r\nagainst a proposed measure, the vote of the state was so counted; and a\r\nproposition having in its favor a majority of the states, was carried.\r\nEvery state was entitled to seven delegates; but there must be at least\r\ntwo delegates present and voting, in order to give a state vote; and if\r\nan equal number of the delegates of a state voted for and against a\r\nproposition, the state was said to be divided, and to have no vote.\r\n\r\n§6. Under the constitution there are two branches of congress, in one of\r\nwhich the number of representatives of each state is in proportion to\r\nits population; in the other, (the senate,) the states are equally\r\nrepresented, on the principle of the confederation, though by two\r\nsenators only. But the vote in both is taken, not by states as under the\r\nconfederation, but _per capita_, that is, by the head or poll, the vote\r\nof each member counting one.\r\n\r\n§7. The articles of confederation were framed by congress, the members\r\nof which were appointed by the state legislatures; and the articles,\r\nwhen framed, were submitted for ratification to the state legislatures.\r\nThe constitution was framed by a convention of delegates from the\r\nstates appointed for that purpose; and was ratified, not by the state\r\nlegislatures, but by state conventions whose members were elected by the\r\npeople of the several states.\r\n\r\n§8. The former union, as has been remarked, was a mere Confederacy,\r\ncomposed of independent states, and united simply for purposes of\r\ndefense and their mutual safety. In most respects they had no more\r\npolitical connection than so many different nations. The people of a\r\nstate were not, properly speaking, citizens of the United States, but\r\nonly citizens of the state in which they lived. But by the constitution,\r\nthe people of the states were incorporated into a nation; and a citizen\r\nof a state is also a citizen of the United States. The government of the\r\nconfederation, although sometimes called the national government, was\r\nnot really such, nor was it generally so regarded, as appears from the\r\nproceedings of the convention that framed the constitution.\r\n\r\n§9. Among the earliest proceedings of the convention was the offering of\r\na resolution, declaring that \"a national government ought to be formed,\r\nconsisting of legislative, judiciary, and executive.\" This resolution\r\nwas strongly opposed by a large portion of the delegates, because it\r\nproposed to establish a _national_ government. They were in favor of\r\ncontinuing the confederation with a slight enlargement of the powers of\r\ncongress, so as to give that body the power to lay and collect taxes,\r\nand to regulate commerce. But the friends of a national government\r\nprevailed; and we have now a complete government, consisting of the\r\nthree departments, legislative, executive, and judicial.\r\n\r\n§10. Under the confederation, there was no executive to execute the\r\nordinances of congress; nor a national judiciary, the state courts being\r\nused for all judicial purposes. There was only a legislature; and that\r\nconsisted of a single body, called the congress, appointed by the state\r\nlegislatures, and having scarcely power enough to entitle it to the name\r\nof legislature.\r\n\r\n§11. But, although the present government, with these three departments\r\nof power, and controlling, in matters of general concern, the action of\r\nthe state governments and of individuals, is properly a national\r\ngovernment; yet it is not wholly such, but partly national and partly\r\nfederal; some of the federal features of the confederation having been\r\nretained in the constitution, as will appear on a further examination of\r\nthis instrument. Hence the union is still called, with propriety, the\r\n_federal union_, and the government the _federal government_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIX.\r\n\r\nLegislative Department. House of Representatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. The first article of the constitution describes the manner in which\r\nthe legislature is formed, and prescribes its principal powers. It\r\ndeclares, \"All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a\r\ncongress of the United States, which shall consist of a senate and house\r\nof representatives.\" Members of the old congress were appointed by the\r\nstate legislatures for one year, and might be recalled by them at any\r\ntime. Representatives are now chosen for two years. It was thought that\r\na single session was too short a term for men in general to acquire the\r\nknowledge and experience necessary to a right performance of the\r\nresponsible duties of a representative. Besides, measures are often left\r\nunfinished at the close of a session; and those who have once examined\r\ntheir merits and demerits, can dispose of them more promptly than new\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n§2. The same clause declares that \"the electors in each state shall have\r\nthe qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of\r\nthe state legislature.\" The qualifications of electors were various in\r\nthe different states. (Chap. VI, §8.) In some of them, owners of\r\nproperty, or tax-payers, in others, freeholders only, were voters. In\r\nsome, only the latter voted for the higher officers; in a few, suffrage\r\nwas almost universal. It was presumed that no state would object to its\r\nown rule for electing the popular branch of its legislature. It is\r\nproper that a representative should be chosen directly by those whose\r\nwants he is to make known, and whose rights he is to guard.\r\n\r\n§3. A representative must, at the time of his election, \"have attained\r\nthe age of twenty-five years; and have been seven years a citizen of the\r\nUnited States;\" and he must \"be an inhabitant of the state in which he\r\nis chosen.\" Few young men, on attaining the age of majority, have the\r\nknowledge, or experience, or wisdom, which is requisite to qualify them\r\nfor the responsible duties of a representative. Nor is it to be presumed\r\nthat an alien, at the earliest period at which he may become a\r\nnaturalized citizen, would be sufficiently familiar with our\r\ninstitutions and the wants of our people to be a competent\r\nrepresentative.\r\n\r\n§4. The next clause prescribes the rule of apportionment.\r\n\"Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several\r\nstates, according to their respective numbers, which shall be determined\r\nby adding to the whole number of free persons, including those bound to\r\nservice for a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed,\r\nthree-fifths of all other persons.\" To the younger class of readers,\r\nthis part of the clause needs explanation.\r\n\r\n§5. The convention found it very difficult to agree upon a rule of\r\napportionment. In the first place, the states, as will be recollected,\r\nwere entitled to an equal number of delegates in the old congress; and\r\neach state had one vote. But as each member of the house of\r\nrepresentatives was to have a vote, the small states opposed a\r\nrepresentation according to numbers, while the large states as\r\nstrenuously insisted upon it.\r\n\r\n§6. In the next place, the slaveholding states claimed a representation\r\naccording to numbers including slaves; the non-slaveholding states\r\ninsisted on a representation according to the number of free persons. It\r\nmay here be observed, that slavery then existed in all the states except\r\nMassachusetts; but as the slaves were so few in the northern states, in\r\nwhich slavery has been since abolished, the latter are generally spoken\r\nof as if they were at that time non-slaveholding states. The controversy\r\non this point rose so high, and the parties were for a long time so\r\nunyielding, that fears were entertained of a sudden dissolution of the\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\n§7. It became evident that the question could be settled only by\r\ncompromise. The northern states consented that in ascertaining the\r\nnumber of persons to be taken as the basis of apportionment,\r\nthree-fifths of the slaves should be added to the number of free\r\npersons. And as these states had opposed the computation of any slaves\r\nin fixing a rule of apportionment, on the ground that slaves are\r\nproperty, and that no property in these states entitled its owners to\r\nrepresentation, the southern states consented, on their part, that\r\n_direct taxes_ should be apportioned on the same basis as\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\n§8. To illustrate this rule by an example: Suppose a state to contain\r\n600,000 free persons, and 500,000 slaves. Adding three-fifths of the\r\nnumber of slaves, (300,000) to the number of free persons, gives 900,000\r\nas the number of the representative population: and the state would be\r\nentitled to _three_ representatives for every _two_ that a state would\r\nhave which contained 600,000 free inhabitants and no slaves. So in\r\napportioning taxes according to population, the state in the case we\r\nhave supposed, would have to raise _three_ dollars for every _two_ that\r\nit would raise if no slaves were counted.\r\n\r\n§9. But the advantages of this arrangement are more unequal than may at\r\nfirst sight appear, or than was anticipated by the framers of the\r\nconstitution. The benefits are chiefly on the side of the slaveholding\r\nstates. In the first place, two-fifths of a large class of property in\r\nthese states is exempt from taxation, while _all_ the property in the\r\nfree states is liable to taxation. Of this the framers were aware. But\r\nthey did not foresee the fact, that the laying of direct taxes would be\r\nunnecessary, and that the slave states would consequently escape\r\ntaxation for their slaves. Only three direct taxes have been laid; and\r\nit is not probable that another will become necessary; the treasury\r\nbeing supplied from other sources, chiefly by duties on imports.\r\n\r\n§10. Now, although nothing is gained by the slave states, nor is\r\nanything lost by the free states, by the exemption of the two-fifths of\r\nthe slaves from taxation, since direct taxes are unnecessary; there is a\r\ngreat gain to the slave states, which have between thirty and forty\r\nrepresentatives for what their laws hold to be \"property to all intents\r\nand purposes whatsoever,\" for which the free states have nothing in\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n§11. The constitution does not limit the house to any definite number of\r\nrepresentatives; it only declares that the number shall not exceed one\r\nfor every 30,000 inhabitants. It requires an enumeration of the\r\ninhabitants every ten years; and the next congress thereafter determines\r\nthe ratio of representation and the number of representatives, and\r\napportions them among the states. The word _ratio_ signifies rate, or\r\nproportion. It here means the number or portion of the inhabitants\r\nentitled to a representative.\r\n\r\n§12. But as a representative for every 30,000 inhabitants, after the\r\npopulation became very numerous, would have made the house too large to\r\ntransact business with due dispatch, and would have unnecessarily\r\nincreased the public expense, the ratio of representation has from time\r\nto time been increased. But to whatever number the ratio may be raised,\r\nthe constitution expressly declares, that \"each state shall have at\r\nleast one representative.\" Neither Delaware nor Florida had, in 1850, a\r\npopulation equal to the present ratio; and without the above\r\nconstitutional provision, these states would have been deprived of a\r\nrepresentation in the house, unless congress had adopted a smaller\r\nratio.\r\n\r\n§13. It will be seen by reference to the constitution, that the number\r\nof representatives was for the time fixed at sixty-five. After the first\r\ncensus, taken in 1790, the ratio was fixed at 33,000, which gave the\r\nhouse 106 members. After the census of 1800, the same ratio was\r\nadopted, and the number of members was 142.\r\n\r\nAfter 1810, the ratio was 35,000; number of members 182.\r\nAfter 1820, the ratio was 40,000; number of members 213.\r\nAfter 1830, the ratio was 47,700; number of members 240.\r\nAfter 1840, the ratio was 70,680; number of members 233.\r\n\r\nAfter 1850, the ratio was 93,000 and a fraction, making the number of\r\nmembers 233, of which California had one; but in view of her rapid\r\nincrease in population, she was allowed an additional member, making, in\r\nall, 234. Minnesota has since been admitted into the Union (1858) with\r\ntwo members, and Oregon (1859) with one member.\r\n\r\n§14. Representatives are chosen by districts. Each state is divided by\r\nthe legislature into as many districts as there are representatives to\r\nbe elected in the state; and one representative is chosen in each\r\ndistrict. In most of the states, representatives are chosen at the\r\ngeneral state election; in the others, there are special elections for\r\nchoosing representatives.\r\n\r\n§15. By an act of congress, every territory belonging to the United\r\nStates in which a government has been established, is entitled to send a\r\ndelegate to congress, who has a right to take a part in the debates of\r\nthe house, but not the right of voting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXX.\r\n\r\nThe Senate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. \"The senate of the United States shall be composed of two senators\r\nfrom each state; chosen by the legislature thereof, for six years; and\r\neach senator shall have one vote.\" (Art. I, sec. 3.) The convention\r\nreadily agreed upon dividing congress into two branches; but, as has\r\nbeen observed, it was difficult to settle the mode of representation.\r\nThe delegates from the large states insisted upon a representation in\r\nproportion to numbers, in the senate as well as in the house; and the\r\nsmall states contended for equality in both branches. The debate was\r\nlong and animated; and it became apparent that, as in the case of slave\r\nrepresentation in the house, there must be a compromise. This was at\r\nlength effected; the small states consenting to a proportional\r\nrepresentation in the house, and the large states to an equal\r\nrepresentation in the senate.\r\n\r\n§2. It has been remarked, that the federative principle of the old\r\nsystem has been to some extent retained in the constitution. Both the\r\nequality of representation in the senate, and the election of senators\r\nby the state legislatures, are in strict conformity with the plan of the\r\nconfederation, and of simple confederacies generally. Different modes of\r\nelecting senators were proposed; but the one adopted by the convention\r\nseems preferable to any other.\r\n\r\n§3. There is, however, in one particular, a material difference between\r\nthe plan of the old congress and that of the senate. It is in the manner\r\nof voting. In the former, the vote was taken by states, each state\r\nhaving but one vote; (Chap. XXVIII, §5,) in the latter, the senators\r\nvote separately, the vote of each senator counting one, as in the house;\r\nand a question is decided by the united votes of a majority of the\r\nmembers, and not by the vote of a majority of the states. Nor is the\r\nvote of a state lost if but one of its senators is present, as formerly.\r\nIf, however, the two senators vote on different sides of a question, the\r\neffect is the same as when, in the old congress, the members from a\r\nstate were equally divided.\r\n\r\n§4. There were also various opinions as to the proper term of office of\r\nsenators. Terms were proposed differing in length from three to nine\r\nyears; and a proposition was even made by one distinguished member to\r\nmake the term continue during good behavior, which is practically for\r\nlife. There appear to be sound objections both to long and short terms.\r\nIt is urged by those in favor of the latter, that an officer elected for\r\na short term, especially if he desires a reëlection, will have a strong\r\ninducement to please and faithfully serve those who are to elect or\r\nappoint him.\r\n\r\n§5. Others, however, while they admit that short terms tend to insure\r\nresponsibility on the part of a representative, consider this argument\r\nmore than counterbalanced by the objections to which a short term is\r\nliable. Looking to a reëlection, he may act with a view to his\r\npopularity rather than to the public good. Again, the oftener a\r\nlegislature is changed, the more changeable and uncertain will be the\r\nlaws. Men having invested their capital in a business enterprise, and\r\nmade a successful beginning under existing laws, may be ruined by a\r\nsudden and unexpected change of governmental policy.\r\n\r\n§6. In view of these objections to both long and short terms, a medium\r\nterm of six years was adopted. This was believed to be short enough to\r\nkeep up in a senator a feeling of responsibility, and yet long enough to\r\ninsure his acting independently and with a regard to the general\r\ninterests of the nation. Although a bad senator may occasionally be kept\r\ntoo long in office by a six years' term, cases also occur in which the\r\nact of a senator, especially in time of public excitement, is strongly\r\ncondemned, but upon calm and mature reflection meets the public\r\napprobation.\r\n\r\n§7. The next clause of the third section provides for the gradual change\r\nof the senate. One-third of the senators go out of office every two\r\nyears. In favor of this arrangement are two important considerations.\r\nFirst, it secures to the public at all times the benefit of the\r\nexperience of at least two-thirds of the body. Whereas, if the terms of\r\nall the senators expired at once, their places might be supplied mainly\r\nby new members without the requisite knowledge and experience. Secondly,\r\nwhile a long term is intended to guard against the too frequent changes\r\nin the laws, it may also prevent, for too long a time, the amendment or\r\nthe repeal of bad laws. Such amendment or repeal may be hastened by the\r\nelection of new members in the place of the one-third who retire every\r\ntwo years.\r\n\r\n§8. Vacancies which happen in the representation of any state in the\r\nsenate during the recess of its legislature, may be filled by the\r\ngovernor until the next meeting of the legislature. Without this\r\nprovision, either the legislature must be assembled immediately to fill\r\nthe vacancy, or the state must remain in part, or perhaps wholly\r\nunrepresented in the senate, until the next regular session of the\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\n§9. But an appointment may not be made by an executive before the\r\nvacancy actually happens. In 1825, the term of a senator was about to\r\nexpire during the recess of the legislature of his state, which had\r\nfailed at its previous session to appoint a successor. As a special\r\nsession of the senate was to be held immediately after the expiration of\r\nthe senator's term, the governor, a few days before the term expired, in\r\nanticipation of the vacancy, reappointed the senator. But the senate\r\ndecided that, as the appointment had been made _before the vacancy\r\nhappened_, the senator was not entitled to a seat.\r\n\r\n§10. The next clause prescribes the qualifications of senators. A\r\nsenator must have attained the age of thirty years, and been nine years\r\na citizen of the United States; and he must, when elected, be an\r\ninhabitant of the state for which he is chosen. As many of the duties of\r\na senator require more knowledge, experience, and stability of character\r\nthan those of a representative, greater age and longer citizenship are\r\nrequired. The nature of these duties will be noticed in subsequent\r\nchapters.\r\n\r\n§11. The seventh section of the first article provides for the passage\r\nof bills negatived, or vetoed, by the president. Bills returned by him\r\nwith his objections, become laws when passed by majorities of two-thirds\r\nof both houses; that is, by two-thirds of the members present. They also\r\nbecome laws if not returned by him within ten days (Sundays excepted)\r\nafter they have been presented to him, unless their return is prevented\r\nby the adjournment of congress.\r\n\r\n§12. We have passed over several sections and clauses of this article\r\nwithout remark. Most of them are similar to some in the state\r\nconstitutions, which we have noticed; and the propriety of others is so\r\nreadily perceived, that any comment upon them is deemed unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXI.\r\n\r\nPower of Congress to lay Taxes, Duties, &c.; Power to Borrow Money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. Having shown how the legislative department of the general\r\ngovernment is constituted, we proceed to consider its powers. It is\r\nthought proper, however, first to notice one important characteristic of\r\nthe general government, in which it differs from the state governments,\r\nand the knowledge of which is necessary to a right understanding of the\r\npowers of the state and national governments respectively.\r\n\r\n§2. The general government is a government of _delegated_ powers; that\r\nis, powers which have been intrusted or _delegated_ to it by the states,\r\nor the people of the states. Having derived its powers from the states,\r\nor the people, it has such powers only as have been conferred by the\r\nconstitution. Hence it is called a government of _limited_ powers. The\r\nstates, on the other hand, existing before the general government, and\r\npossessing entire sovereignty or supreme power, may exercise all powers\r\nwhich they have not surrendered to the general government. In other\r\nwords, their powers are _unlimited_, except so far as they have parted\r\nwith any of their original powers.\r\n\r\n§3. Most of the powers of congress are enumerated in the eighth section\r\nof the first article of the constitution. The first in the list is in\r\nthese words: \"Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes,\r\nduties, imposts, and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the\r\ncommon defense and general welfare of the United States; but all duties,\r\nimposts, and excises shall be uniform throughout the U. States.\"\r\n\r\n§4. We have already noticed the want of such a power in the old\r\ncongress. The debt which had been contracted to carry on the war\r\nremained unpaid; and congress, as we have seen, had no power to raise\r\nmoney either to pay debts or to defray the current expenses of the\r\ngovernment. (Chap. XXVII: §4, 6.) It could neither raise money by\r\n_direct_ taxation; that is, by taxing the persons and property of the\r\ncitizens, nor by _indirect_ taxation, which is by duties.\r\n\r\n§5. _Duties_, or _customs_, are taxes on goods imported from, or\r\nexported to, a foreign country. _Imposts_ are taxes on imported goods\r\nonly. Duties on exports, however, being deemed inexpedient, are not laid\r\nby our government. An _excise_ is a tax neither on imports nor exports,\r\nbut on articles produced and consumed in the country, and on licenses to\r\ndeal in certain commodities. The money paid for license to sell\r\nspirituous liquors is an _excise_ tax.\r\n\r\n§6. Duties are _specific_ and _ad valorem_. A _specific_ duty is a\r\nspecified sum of money charged upon every yard, pound, or gallon of any\r\ncommodity. Thus, a duty of ten cents on a pound of tea, or of one dollar\r\non a yard of cloth, or of fifty cents on a gallon of wine, is a specific\r\nduty. _Ad valorem_ is a Latin phrase, signifying _according to the\r\nvalue_. An _ad valorem_ duty is a certain _per centage_ on the value or\r\nprice. Thus, thirty per cent, on a yard of cloth costing two dollars, is\r\nsixty cents; on a yard costing three dollars, ninety cents; the sum\r\ncharged being varied by the difference in the price or value.\r\n\r\n§7. The power to lay duties is very properly qualified by the provision\r\nthat \"all duties shall be uniform throughout the United States.\" This\r\nwas intended to prevent the giving of unjust preference to any one or\r\nmore states over others. Without this restriction upon the exercise of\r\nthis power, the representatives of a part of the states might combine,\r\nand by laying higher duties upon goods imported into other states, than\r\nupon those imported into their own, might turn the trade chiefly into\r\nthe latter. Or they might in laying duties on exports, impose high\r\nduties upon the productions of other states, and low duties, or none at\r\nall, upon the products of their own.\r\n\r\n§8. Although Congress has power to lay direct taxes, it has seldom been\r\nexercised. The duties on foreign goods and on the vessels in which they\r\nwere imported, have been found sufficient for the payment of the public\r\ndebt, and for other government purposes. The national debt in 1791 was\r\nabout $75,000,000, and, in 1804, had risen to $86,000,000; yet chiefly\r\nby duties was this debt reduced nearly one-half by the year 1812. By the\r\nwar which commenced that year, the debt was again increased, being in\r\n1816, $127,000,000. In 1835, this large debt had been, in the manner\r\nstated, entirely extinguished.\r\n\r\n§9. The next power mentioned is the \"power to borrow money on the credit\r\nof the United States.\" Although Congress may, under the power to lay\r\ntaxes and duties, raise money to any extent, a large amount may\r\nsometimes be wanted before it can be raised from the regular income or\r\nrevenue of the nation, or even before it could be raised by a direct\r\ntax, which would be burdensome to the people. Hence the utility of the\r\npower to borrow money until it can be reimbursed from the national\r\nrevenues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXII.\r\n\r\nPower of Congress to Regulate Commerce. Commerce with Foreign Nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. Next in the list of powers is \"the power to regulate commerce with\r\nforeign nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian\r\ntribes.\" The need of no power under the confederation was more deeply\r\nfelt than the power to regulate foreign trade. It was the want of this\r\npower, as we have seen, which was the more immediate cause of calling\r\nthe convention that framed the constitution. (Chap. XXVII: §7-11.) The\r\nnecessity of this power arose mainly from the policy of Great Britain,\r\nby which she had secured to herself undue advantages in her foreign\r\ncommerce, especially in her trade with this country.\r\n\r\n§2. During the war of the revolution, the direct trade with Great\r\nBritain was interrupted. But when peace was restored, our markets were\r\nagain open to British goods and vessels, while upon American produce and\r\nAmerican vessels entering British ports, heavy duties were levied. To\r\nenable some young readers more clearly to understand the objects and the\r\nunequal operation of the policy of the British government, the subject\r\nmay need some further illustration.\r\n\r\n§3. One object was, to secure a market at home for the products of\r\nagricultural labor. How this is done by taxing foreign products, will\r\nappear from the following example: Suppose the market value of a bushel\r\nof wheat in Great Britain to be one dollar a bushel, and the cost of\r\nraising the article here and carrying it to that market to be the same.\r\nIf now a duty of 40 cents a bushel is laid upon wheat from abroad, the\r\nEnglish consumer, instead of buying it with this duty added, will buy of\r\nthe English producer. But more wheat is produced here than there is a\r\nmarket for; and the American farmer must find a market abroad. But in\r\norder to sell it in the English market, he must pay 40 cents on every\r\nbushel to the British government; or, which is the same thing in effect,\r\nhe must sell it for 40 cents a bushel less than its value to the British\r\npurchaser, who pays the duty to that government.\r\n\r\n§4. Now, as much less American wheat will be sent to Great Britain than\r\nif it were free from duty, a better market is secured to the English\r\nfarmer. Besides this, of the value of every bushel which Great Britain\r\nmay please to admit, or which the people of other countries maybe\r\nobliged to sell to her, 40 per cent, is paid into her treasury. Thus by\r\none operation, are two benefits secured, namely, the reward of\r\nagricultural labor at home, and the raising of revenue. So by the duties\r\nimposed upon foreign vessels entering her ports, the national revenue\r\nwas to some extent increased, and great advantages were secured to her\r\ncitizens engaged in the carrying trade.\r\n\r\n§5. The people of this country being nearly all employed in agriculture,\r\nand consequently dependent upon foreign markets for the sale of the\r\nsurplus products of their labor, they were obliged to submit to the\r\npayment of these duties. And not possessing at that time the means of\r\nmanufacturing to any considerable extent for themselves, goods in large\r\nquantities came in from Great Britain, for which they must pay in\r\nproduce heavily burdened with duties, or with money obtained for the\r\nproduce subject to these heavy duties.\r\n\r\n§6. To remove the inequality in the trade between the two countries, it\r\nwas thought necessary to retaliate upon Great Britain by subjecting her\r\ngoods and vessels coming into our ports to the payment of duties similar\r\nto those imposed on our produce and vessels in her ports. But the power\r\nto lay duties was with the states; and, as we have seen, the states\r\ncould not agree upon any effectual system; for, in order to make any\r\nsystem effectual, the duties must be uniform throughout the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n§7. It was intended, in regulating trade, to render our own country less\r\ndependent upon foreign nations for manufactured goods, by encouraging\r\ndomestic or home manufactures by duties on goods imported. Duties laid\r\nfor this purpose are called _protective_ duties, being designed to\r\n_protect_ our manufacturers against loss from the competition of\r\nforeigners. The nature and operation of a protective duty may be thus\r\nillustrated:\r\n\r\n§8. Suppose foreign broadcloth of a certain quality is sold in this\r\ncountry for $2.50 a yard, and cloth of the same quality manufactured\r\nhere can not be afforded for less than $3 a yard. There would now be no\r\nencouragement to any one to engage in the manufacture of such cloth;\r\nbecause in order to sell it, he must reduce the price to that of the\r\nforeign article, which would subject him to a loss of fifty cents a\r\nyard. Let now a duty of $1 a yard be laid upon the foreign cloth, and\r\nthe price would be $3.50, and preference would be given to the domestic\r\narticle, unless the importer should reduce the price of his foreign\r\ncloth to $3; in which case, it is to be presumed, about an equal\r\nquantity of each would be consumed, and the duty of $1 a yard on the\r\nforeign cloth would go into the United States' treasury.\r\n\r\n§9. The same objects may, to some extent, be effected by the first\r\nmentioned power, \"to lay taxes, duties,\" &c. In laying duties for\r\nrevenue, that is, raising money to pay the debts and other expenses of\r\nthe government, congress may lay the duties upon those kinds of goods\r\nwhich it wishes to protect; and thus _indirectly_ both encourage\r\ndomestic industry and regulate commerce. From this it appears that the\r\nthree objects mentioned may be accomplished under the grant of either\r\none of the two general powers, to lay duties, and to regulate commerce.\r\n\r\n§10. Why, then, it may be asked, were both these powers inserted in the\r\nconstitution? The first _expressly_ authorizes the laying of duties only\r\nto raise money for paying debts and government expenses; and protection\r\nand the regulation of commerce can only be effected _indirectly_. Hence,\r\nif our arrangements with foreign nations should be such as to render it\r\nunnecessary to lay duties to regulate commerce, or encourage domestic\r\nindustry, money could not be raised without the _express_ power to lay\r\ntaxes, duties, &c. And such might be the state of things, that rates of\r\nduties sufficient for revenue would be insufficient for the purposes of\r\nprotection and regulating trade. Therefore, both powers are properly\r\ngranted to congress.\r\n\r\n§11. Again, it may be asked, if foreign goods without duty can be had at\r\nlower prices than domestic, why is it not better for us to buy them than\r\nto force the manufacture and sale of our own at higher prices? and, if\r\nthere is no other way of raising money, why not do it by direct\r\ntaxation? Suppose, for example, as in a preceding section, (§8,) the\r\nprice of foreign cloth to be $2.50 a yard, for which the farmer has to\r\npay in wheat, or in cash received for it. But as the wheat has to be\r\nshipped to a foreign market, the merchant who takes it in exchange for\r\nthe cloth, or the cash purchaser, deducts from the foreign market price\r\nthe cost of transportation and the foreign duty, which, together, let us\r\nsuppose to be fifty cents a bushel, or one-half of the foreign market\r\nprice. A yard of cloth would then cost five bushels of wheat.\r\n\r\n§12. Let us now suppose a domestic article at $3 a yard to take the\r\nplace of the foreign. A large portion of the laborers formerly employed\r\nin agriculture, are now engaged in building factories and in\r\nmanufacturing. These, instead of being producers, have become only\r\nconsumers of the wheat of the farmers, who now have a market at home,\r\nthus saving the duties and the cost of transportation. As there are now\r\nfewer producers, the price of wheat would probably be not less than $1 a\r\nbushel. Therefore a yard of domestic cloth would cost only _three_\r\nbushels of wheat, instead of _five_ paid for the foreign cloth. And as\r\nthere would be a corresponding rise in the price of labor, more cloth at\r\n$3 a yard could be bought for the avails of a day's labor than formerly.\r\n\r\n§13. The protection of domestic industry received the early attention of\r\ncongress. The second law passed by the first congress under the\r\nconstitution, authorized \"duties to be laid on goods, wares, and\r\nmerchandises imported;\" and among the objects of the law expressed in a\r\npreamble one was \"the encouragement and protection of domestic\r\nmanufactures.\" For a long time, however, little was done in the way of\r\nprotection. The principal nations of Europe, England included, became\r\ninvolved in war. A large portion of their laboring population having\r\nbeen called from agricultural pursuits into the armies, a foreign demand\r\nwas created for American produce; and we were enabled to supply\r\nourselves at less disadvantage with foreign manufactures.\r\n\r\n§14. But after peace had been restored in Europe, and people had\r\nreturned to their usual employments, the foreign demand for our\r\nbreadstuffs nearly ceased; and large quantities of foreign goods were\r\nagain imported, for which our people were unable to pay. Congress now\r\nfound it necessary to exercise, to a greater extent, its power to\r\nregulate trade, by discouraging importations, and encouraging domestic\r\nmanufactures, and, in 1816, commenced an effective system of\r\nprotection. Laws have from time to time been passed to favor\r\nmanufactures from cotton, wool, iron, and other materials; and\r\nmanufacturing is now carried on extensively in this country. By thus\r\ndrawing a large portion of the people into manufacturing and mechanical\r\nemployments, a market has been created at home for more grain, meat, and\r\nother agricultural products, than is required to supply all foreign\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\n§15. The laws relating to foreign commerce prescribe the manner of\r\ncollecting the revenue. There is in every port of entry a _collector_ of\r\n_customs_, who superintends the collection of duties. When a vessel\r\narrives it is submitted, with the cargo and all papers and invoices, to\r\nthe inspection of the proper officers; and the goods subject to duty are\r\nweighed and measured, and the duties estimated according to law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXIII.\r\n\r\nPower to regulate Commerce, continued. Navigation; Commerce among the\r\nStates, and with the Indian Tribes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. In regulating foreign commerce, congress has also passed navigation\r\nlaws. _Navigation_ is the art of conducting ships and other vessels. It\r\nhas reference also to the rules to be observed by owners and masters\r\nengaged in the shipping trade. We have noticed the navigation acts of\r\nGreat Britain by which she built up her shipping interest; (Chap. XXVII,\r\n§7,) and we have stated that one object of the power to regulate\r\ncommerce was to countervail the effects of those acts upon our shipping.\r\n\r\n§2. To encourage and promote domestic navigation, an act was passed by\r\nthe first congress conferring special privileges upon vessels built and\r\nowned by citizens of the United States. This was done by laying _duties\r\non tunnage_. _Tunnage_ means the content of a ship, or the burden that\r\nit will carry, which is ascertained by measurement, 42 cubic feet being\r\nallowed to a tun. This act imposed a duty of fifty cents a tun on\r\nforeign vessels, and upon our own a duty of only six cents a tun. As\r\nsuch a law discriminates, or makes a distinction or difference between\r\ndomestic and foreign vessels, these duties are also called\r\n_discriminating_ duties.\r\n\r\n§3. By the aid of these protective duties, slightly changed from time to\r\ntime, our shipping interest acquired great strength. But the necessity\r\nof discriminating duties no longer exists. By the stipulations of\r\nexisting treaties between the principal commercial nations, each is to\r\nadmit into her ports the vessels of the others on equal terms with her\r\nown. Our government having become a party to this agreement,\r\ndiscriminating tunnage duties have been abolished.\r\n\r\n§4. The registry, however, of vessels of the United States, and other\r\nregulations concerning them, are for the most part continued. A vessel\r\nis measured by a surveyor to ascertain her tunnage, and the collector\r\nrecords or registers in a book her name, the port to which she belongs,\r\nher burden or tunnage, and the name of the place in which she was built,\r\nand gives to the owner or commander a certificate of such registry.\r\n\r\n§5. The master of a vessel departing from the United States, bound to a\r\nforeign port, must deliver to the collector of the district, a\r\n_manifest_, which is an invoice, or account of the particulars of a\r\ncargo of goods, and of their prices or value. This statement is\r\nsubscribed by the master, and sworn by him to be true. The collector\r\nthen grants a _clearance_, for the vessel, which is a certificate\r\nstating that the commander has cleared his vessel according to law.\r\n\r\n§6. Vessels of the United States going to foreign countries, are, at the\r\nrequest of the masters, furnished with passports. A _passport_ is a\r\nwriting from the proper authority of a state or kingdom, granting\r\npermission to pass from place to place, or to navigate some sea without\r\nhinderance or molestation. It contains the name of the vessel and that\r\nof her master, her tunnage, and the number of her crew, certifying that\r\nshe belongs to the subjects of a particular state, and requiring all\r\npersons at peace with that state, to suffer her to proceed on her voyage\r\nwithout interruption. In this country the form of a passport is prepared\r\nby the secretary of state, and approved by the president.\r\n\r\n§7. The navigation laws also provide for the safety of passengers and\r\nthe crews of vessels, limiting the number of passengers on passenger\r\nvessels, and prescribing the quantity of water and certain kinds of\r\nprovisions which merchant vessels are required to have for each person\r\non board. They also declare what persons may be employed on board, and\r\nhow funds shall be provided for sick and disabled seamen.\r\n\r\n§8. Under the power to regulate commerce, congress has also passed laws\r\nrelating to quarantines. The word _quarantine_, from the Latin\r\n_quarantina_, signifies the space of forty days. Originally vessels\r\nsuspected of having contagious sickness on board, or of being infected\r\nwith malignant, contagious disease, were forbidden, for forty days, to\r\nhave intercourse with the place or port at which they arrived. The\r\nperiod for which ships are now detained is not defined, but is fixed by\r\nthe proper officers at their discretion, according to circumstances.\r\nQuarantines are required by the health laws of the states; and by the\r\nlaws of congress, vessels are to be subject to the health laws of the\r\nstate at whose ports they arrive.\r\n\r\n§9. In connection with the power to regulate foreign commerce, power is\r\ngiven to regulate \"commerce among the several states,\" or _internal_\r\ncommerce. We have noticed the difficulties which attended the different\r\ncommercial regulations of the states, and the necessity of a uniform\r\nsystem, which could be had only by giving congress alone the power to\r\nregulate commerce. (Chap. XXXI., §7.) Without the power to regulate\r\n_internal_ commerce, congress could not give effect to the power to\r\nregulate foreign commerce. One state might impose unjust and oppressive\r\nduties upon goods imported or exported through it by another state. But\r\nin the hands of congress, the power to regulate internal as well as\r\nforeign commerce, secures to all the states the benefits of a free and\r\nuninterrupted trade.\r\n\r\n§10. In granting to congress the power to regulate commerce \"with the\r\nIndian tribes,\" it was intended to lessen the dangers of war. Murders\r\nand war had been provoked by the improper conduct of some of the states.\r\nIt was believed, that, by a uniform policy, difficulties would be more\r\nlikely to be prevented; and that if they should occur, they would be\r\nmore likely to be amicably settled by the general government than by a\r\nstate, which, being an interested party, would be more liable to\r\nmisjudge the matter in dispute, and more rigid in demanding satisfaction\r\nfor injuries, as well as more severe in redressing them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXIV.\r\n\r\nPowers of Congress in relation to Naturalization; Bankruptcy; Coining\r\nMoney; Weights and Measures; Punishment of Counterfeiting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. The next clause grants to congress the power \"to establish a uniform\r\nrule of naturalization, and uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies\r\nthroughout the United States.\" We have already noticed some of the\r\ndisqualifications of aliens. (Chap. VI, §5.) By the common law of\r\nEngland and this country, aliens were not only politically disqualified,\r\nbut they could not in their own name lawfully hold and sell real estate.\r\nTo admit aliens to all the rights and privileges of citizens immediately\r\non their arrival in this country, and before they shall have acquired a\r\nknowledge of our government and laws, and of the duties of citizens,\r\nwould be expedient. Educated under monarchical governments, many of\r\nthem, it is to be presumed, have little respect for our republican\r\ninstitutions, or at most but an imperfect knowledge of them.\r\n\r\n§2. But to deny foreigners the rights of citizens after they shall have\r\nacquired a fixed residence here, and a knowledge of their civil and\r\npolitical duties, would be illiberal and unjust. Provision has therefore\r\nbeen made for removing their disqualifications, or for _naturalizing_\r\nthem; that is, for investing them with the rights and privileges of\r\n_natural_ born citizens. But if different rules were established by the\r\ndifferent states, a person, having become naturalized in one state,\r\nwould, on removing into another state, be deprived of the rights of\r\ncitizenship, until he should have been naturalized by the laws of such\r\nstate. Besides, by the constitution, a person, on becoming a citizen of\r\nany state, is a citizen of the United States, and entitled to the\r\nprivileges of a citizen in any other state. (Art. IV., §2.) As,\r\ntherefore, there should be one uniform rule, the power of naturalization\r\nis properly given to congress.\r\n\r\n§3. An alien, to become a citizen, must declare on oath before a state\r\ncourt or a circuit court of the United States, or before a clerk of\r\neither of said courts, after having resided three years in the United\r\nStates, that it is his intention to become a citizen, and to renounce\r\nhis allegiance to all foreign governments, and particularly that under\r\nwhich he formerly lived, and that he will support the constitution of\r\nthe United States. Then after two years, the court, if satisfied that he\r\nhas resided five years in the United States, and one year in the state\r\nin which the court is held, and that during that time he has behaved as\r\na man of good moral character, and is attached to the principles of the\r\nconstitution, may admit him as a citizen.\r\n\r\n§4. An alien minor who has resided in the United States at least three\r\nyears before he was twenty-one years of age, may, at any time after that\r\nage and five years' residence in the United States, be admitted as a\r\ncitizen, without having previously declared his intention to become a\r\ncitizen. Also the minor children of a naturalized citizen, if dwelling\r\nin the United States at the time of his naturalization, become\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n§5. A _bankrupt_ is an insolvent debtor; that is, a person who is unable\r\nto pay all his just debts. A _bankrupt law_ is a law which, upon an\r\ninsolvent's giving up all his property to his creditors, discharges him\r\nfrom the payment of his debts. Such laws are designed for the benefit of\r\nhonest and unfortunate debtors, who, by having the enjoyment of their\r\nfuture earnings secured to them, are encouraged to engage anew in\r\nindustrial pursuits. But these laws, intended for the benefit of the\r\nunfortunate poor, have enabled dishonest and fraudulent debtors to\r\nprocure a release from their debts.\r\n\r\n§6. Experience had shown the propriety of intrusting to congress the\r\npower to make these laws. The dissimilar and conflicting laws of the\r\ndifferent states, and the entire want of them in others, had caused\r\ngreat inconvenience. A debtor, though discharged from debt by the laws\r\nof one state, was liable to be prosecuted on removing into another\r\nstate. Important as such laws were deemed, there is no existing law on\r\nthe subject. A bankrupt law was passed in April, 1800, and repealed in\r\nDecember, 1803. Another was passed in 1841, which was of still shorter\r\nduration.\r\n\r\n§7. The next power mentioned is the power \"to coin money and regulate\r\nthe value thereof.\" As a consequence of giving this power to Congress,\r\nwe have a uniform currency throughout the union. We have also, instead\r\nof the awkward system of reckoning by pounds, shillings, and pence, the\r\nmore convenient decimal mode of calculation by dollars and cents. The\r\nold system was rendered the more inconvenient by the difference in the\r\nvalue of a pound, shilling, and penny in the different states. A\r\nmerchant in a New England state, buying goods in New York or\r\nPhiladelphia, must, in order to put prices upon them, reduce the\r\ncurrency of the state in which he bought them to New England currency.\r\nThus, the cost of an article being in New York two shillings and four\r\npence a pound, would be in Connecticut one shilling and nine pence. One\r\nshilling and six pence in New York would be in any New England state\r\none shilling and a penny and a half.\r\n\r\n§8. The place where money is coined is called _mint_. The principal mint\r\nin the United States, and the first that was established in this\r\ncountry, is at Philadelphia. The business of coining is under the\r\nsuperintendence of a director. Under him are a treasurer, an assayer, a\r\nchief coiner, an engraver, and a melter and refiner. The gold and\r\nsilver, before it is coined, is called _bullion_. There is a branch mint\r\nin New Orleans, one at Charlotte, in North Carolina, one at Dahlonega,\r\nin Georgia, one in California, and one in the city of New York. At the\r\nplace last mentioned, gold is assayed, but not coined.\r\n\r\n§9. The clause containing the power last quoted, gives power also to\r\n\"fix the standard of weights and measures.\" For the convenience of trade\r\nbetween the states, the standard of weights and measures should be the\r\nsame in all the states. Without such uniformity, commerce among the\r\nstates would meet with embarrassments scarcely less than those\r\nexperienced from the want of a uniform currency. To effect the desired\r\nobject, this power was given to congress.\r\n\r\n§10. The next power in the list is the power \"to provide for the\r\npunishment of counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the\r\nUnited States.\" By securities here are meant bonds and other evidences\r\nof debt. As the general government has the power to borrow money and to\r\ncoin money, it is proper that it should also have the power to provide\r\nfor punishing those who forge its written obligations for the payment of\r\nthe money borrowed, and who counterfeit its coin. These offenses are\r\ntried in the courts of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXV.\r\n\r\nPowers of Congress in relation to Post-Offices, Copy-Rights, and\r\nPatents, and Inferior Courts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. Congress has power \"to establish post-offices and post-roads.\" The\r\npost-office department, from the facilities which it affords for the\r\ncirculation of intelligence and the transaction of business, is an\r\ninstitution of incalculable value to the union. It is impossible to\r\nconceive all the difficulties which would attend the exercise of this\r\npower by the different states. A uniform system of regulations is\r\nindispensable to the efficiency of this department, and could be secured\r\nonly by placing this power in the hands of congress.\r\n\r\n§2. Congress has power \"to promote the progress of science and the\r\nuseful arts, by securing, for limited times, to authors and inventors,\r\nthe exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.\"\r\nUseful sciences and arts are promoted by new books and new inventions.\r\nBut if every man had the right to print and sell every book or writing,\r\nwithout compensation to the author, there would be little to encourage\r\nmen of ability to spend, as is often done, years of labor in preparing\r\nnew and useful works. Nor would men of genius be likely to spend their\r\ntime and money in inventing and constructing expensive machinery, if\r\nothers had an equal right to make and sell the same. In pursuance of the\r\npower here given, congress has enacted laws for the benefit of authors\r\nand inventors.\r\n\r\n§3. The exclusive right of an author to the benefits of the sale of his\r\nbooks or writings, is called _copy-right_, and is obtained thus: The\r\nauthor sends a printed copy of the title of his book to the clerk of the\r\ndistrict court of the United States of the district in which the author\r\nresides. The clerk records the title in a book, for which he receives\r\nfifty cents, and gives the author, under the seal of the court, a copy\r\nof the record, for which also he receives fifty cents.\r\n\r\n§4. The author must also, within three months after the first\r\npublication of the work, deliver a copy of the same to the clerk of the\r\ndistrict court. And he must cause to be printed on the title page or\r\npage immediately following, of every copy of the book, words showing\r\nthat the law has been complied with. This secures to the author the sole\r\nright to print and sell his work for twenty-eight years, at the\r\nexpiration of which time, he may have his right continued for fourteen\r\nyears longer, by again complying with the requirements of the law as\r\nbefore, provided it be done within six months before the expiration of\r\nthe first term, and a copy of the record published in a newspaper for\r\nthe space of four weeks.\r\n\r\n§5. _Patents_ for new inventions are obtained at the patent office at\r\nthe seat of government. This office is connected with the department of\r\nthe interior. (Chap. XLI, §7.) The commissioner of patents superintends\r\nthe granting of patents under the direction of the secretary of the\r\ninterior. To secure an exclusive right to an invention, the inventor\r\nmust deliver to the commissioner of patents, a written description of\r\nhis invention, and specify the improvement which he claims as his own\r\ndiscovery; and he must make oath that he believes he is the discoverer\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\n§6. Before the petition of an inventor is considered, he must pay the\r\nsum of thirty dollars. If the commissioner, upon examination, does not\r\nfind that the invention had been before discovered, he issues a patent\r\ntherefor. Patents are granted for the term of fourteen years, and may be\r\nrenewed for a further term of seven years, if the inventor has not been\r\nable to obtain a reasonable profit from his invention.\r\n\r\n§7. Congress has power \"to constitute tribunals inferior to the supreme\r\ncourt.\" As the first section of the third article of the constitution,\r\nin providing for a national judiciary, authorizes congress to ordain and\r\nestablish such inferior courts, the insertion of the power in this place\r\nseems to have been unnecessary, (Chap. XLII, §1.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXVI.\r\n\r\nPowers of Congress in relation to Piracy and Offenses against the Law of\r\nNations; War; Marque and Reprisal, Public Defense, District of Columbia;\r\nImplied Powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. The next clause grants to congress the power \"to define and punish\r\npiracies and felonies committed on the high seas, and offenses against\r\nthe law of nations.\" _Piracy_ is commonly defined to be forcible robbery\r\nor depredation upon the high seas. But the term _felony_ was not exactly\r\ndefined by the laws of England, whence the common law of this country\r\nwas derived; consequently its meaning was not the same in all the\r\nstates. It was sometimes applied to capital offenses only; at other\r\ntimes, to all crimes above misdemeanors. For the sake of uniformity, the\r\npower to define these offenses is given to congress: and as the states\r\nhave no jurisdiction beyond their own limits, it is proper that congress\r\nshould have the power to punish as well as define crimes committed on\r\nthe high seas.\r\n\r\n§2. Nor were offenses against the law of nations more clearly defined:\r\ntherefore the power to define these are with equal propriety given to\r\ncongress. As our citizens are regarded by foreign nations as citizens of\r\nthe United States and not as citizens of their respective states; and as\r\nthe general government alone is responsible to foreign nations for\r\ninjuries committed on the high seas by citizens of the United States,\r\nthis power is vested in congress.\r\n\r\n§3. Congress is also properly intrusted with the power \"to declare war;\r\ngrant letters of marque and reprisal; and make rules concerning captures\r\non land and water.\" It is very evident that a single state ought not to\r\nbe allowed to make war. As the people of all the states become involved\r\nin the evils of war, the power to declare it is justly given to the\r\nrepresentatives of the whole nation. In monarchical governments this\r\npower is exercised by the king, or supreme ruler. But so important a\r\npower should not be intrusted to a single individual. The framers of\r\nthe constitution have wisely intrusted it to the representatives of\r\nthose who have to bear the burdens of the war.\r\n\r\n§4. _Marque_ means passing the frontier or limits of a country;\r\n_reprisal_, taking in return. _Letters of marque and reprisal_ authorize\r\npersons injured by citizens or subjects of another nation to seize the\r\nbodies or goods of any of the citizens of such nation, and detain them\r\nuntil satisfaction shall be made. To permit an individual to act as\r\njudge in his own case in redressing his private wrongs would increase\r\nthe dangers of war.\r\n\r\n§5. Nor should a state be permitted to authorize its citizens to make\r\nreprisals; for, although such authority is designed to enable the\r\ncitizens of one country to obtain redress for injuries committed by\r\nthose of another, without a resort to war, the tendency of reprisals is\r\nto provoke rather than to prevent war; and as the whole nation becomes\r\ninvolved in a war, the power to authorize reprisals properly belongs to\r\nthe general government. Indeed it is not clear that such license ought\r\never to be given. It does not appear strictly just to capture the bodies\r\nor goods of unoffending persons, especially before war has been declared\r\nbetween the two countries. But if the power to grant such license is\r\never to be exercised, it ought to be vested in congress.\r\n\r\n§6. As congress has the power to declare war, it ought to have power to\r\nmake rules concerning the property captured in time of war. The general\r\npractice is to distribute the proceeds of the property among the captors\r\nas a reward for bravery and a stimulus to exertion. But proof must be\r\nmade in a court of the United States that the property was taken from\r\nthe enemy, before it is condemned by the court as a prize.\r\n\r\n§7. The next five clauses provide for the security and defense of the\r\nnation. The power to declare war would be of little use in the hands of\r\ncongress, without power over the army, navy and militia. This had been\r\nproved by experience Congress had power under the confederation to\r\ndeclare war; but, as we have seen, it could not raise troops, nor compel\r\nthe states to raise them. To guard against similar difficulties in\r\nfuture, power to control the public forces was placed where it can be\r\npromptly and effectively exercised.\r\n\r\n§8. The next power of congress is, \"to exercise exclusive legislation\r\nover such district, not exceeding ten miles square, as may, by cession\r\nof particular states, and the acceptance of congress, become the seat of\r\ngovernment of the United States.\" If the seat of the general government\r\nwere within the jurisdiction of a state, congress and other public\r\nofficers would be dependent on the state authority for protection in the\r\ndischarge of their duties. To guard the public business more effectually\r\nagainst the danger of interruption, complete and exclusive power at the\r\nseat of government is given to congress. The old congress had once, near\r\nthe close of the Revolution, been treated with insult and abuse while\r\nsitting at Philadelphia; and the executive authority of Pennsylvania\r\nhaving failed to afford protection, congress adjourned to Princeton in\r\nthe State of New Jersey.\r\n\r\n§9. It appears that the cession of this territory to the general\r\ngovernment had not yet been made; but it was in contemplation by the\r\nstates of Virginia and Maryland to cede it. It is called the _District\r\nof Columbia_. Its inhabitants are subject to the laws of congress. That\r\npart of the district which was ceded by Virginia, was in 1846,\r\nretroceded _by_ congress to that state. To congress is given, with equal\r\npropriety, exclusive authority over all places purchased \"for the\r\nerection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dock-yards, and other needful\r\nbuildings.\"\r\n\r\n§10. The last power granted in this section, is the power \"to make all\r\nlaws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the\r\nforegoing powers, and all other powers vested by this constitution in\r\nthe government of the United States, or in any department or officer\r\nthereof.\" As it was impossible to enumerate in the constitution every\r\nparticular act which congress might find it necessary to perform,\r\ncertain powers were expressly granted; and to these powers was added\r\nthis general grant of power to pass laws for carrying them into effect.\r\n\r\n§11. It is the opinion of eminent statesmen that this clause confers no\r\nadditional power. They hold that the power therein granted is\r\nnecessarily _implied_ or included in the foregoing powers. For example:\r\nThe power \"to regulate commerce\" includes the power to cause the\r\nconstruction of break-waters and light-houses, the removal of\r\nobstructions from navigable rivers, and the improvement of harbors; for\r\nin regulating and facilitating commerce, these works and improvements\r\nare absolutely necessary. So the power \"to establish post-offices\"\r\nimplies the power to punish persons for robbing the mail. The doctrine\r\nis, \"that wherever a general power to do a thing is given, every\r\nparticular power for doing it is included.\" Hence it is inferred that\r\ncongress would have had the power to pass the laws here authorized,\r\nthough no express power for that purpose had been given.\r\n\r\n§12. Besides the long list of powers contained in the eighth section of\r\nthe first article of the constitution, and considered in preceding\r\nchapters, there are sundry other powers of congress in subsequent\r\narticles, which will be noticed in their order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXVII.\r\n\r\nProhibitions on Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. While the constitution confers on congress all the powers deemed\r\nnecessary to be exercised for the general welfare, it imposes on\r\ncongress certain restrictions, the most of which are contained in the\r\nnext section. (Art. I, sec. 9.) The first prohibition is in these words:\r\n\"The migration or importation of such persons as any of the states, now\r\nexisting, shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the\r\ncongress prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight; but a\r\ntax or duty may be imposed on such importation, not exceeding ten\r\ndollars for each person.\"\r\n\r\n§2. It is generally known that, from an early period, slaves had been\r\nimported into the colonies from Africa. At the time when the\r\nconstitution was formed, laws prohibiting the foreign slave trade had\r\nbeen passed in all the states except North Carolina, South Carolina, and\r\nGeorgia. The delegates from these states in the convention insisted on\r\nhaving the privilege of importing slaves secured, by withholding from\r\ncongress the power to prohibit the importation. A majority of the\r\nconvention were in favor of leaving congress free to prohibit the trade\r\nat any time. But as it was doubtful whether these states would in such\r\ncase accede to the constitution; and as it was desirable to bring as\r\nmany states as possible into the union; it was at length agreed that the\r\ntrade should be left open, and free to all the states choosing to\r\ncontinue it, until 1808, (twenty years;) congress being allowed,\r\nhowever, to lay a duty or tax of ten dollars on every slave imported.\r\n\r\n§3. It has ever been a cause of wonder and regret to many, that the\r\ntraffic in human beings should have been permitted by the constitution,\r\neven for the most limited period. It is, however, a gratifying fact,\r\nthat congress exercised its power for terminating the foreign slave\r\ntrade, at the earliest possible period. A law was passed in 1807, to go\r\ninto effect in January, 1808, making it unlawful, under severe\r\npenalties, to import slaves into the United States; and in 1820, the\r\nAfrican slave trade was by law declared _piracy_, and made punishable by\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n§4. The next clause is, \"The privilege of the writ of _habeas corpus_\r\nshall not be suspended, unless when, in cases of rebellion or invasion,\r\nthe public safety may require it.\" _Habeas corpus_, (Latin,) signifies,\r\n_have the body_. A person deprived of his liberty, may, before the final\r\njudgment of a court is pronounced against him, petition a court or\r\njudge, who issues a writ commanding the party imprisoning or detaining\r\nhim, to produce his body and the cause of his detention before the judge\r\nor court. If the imprisonment or detention is found to be illegal, or\r\nwithout sufficient cause, the prisoner is set at liberty.\r\n\r\n§5. The next clause declares, \"No bill of attainder or _ex post facto_\r\nlaw shall be passed.\" A _bill of attainder_ is an act of the legislature\r\nby which the punishment of death is inflicted upon a person for some\r\ncrime, without any trial. If it inflicts a milder punishment, it is\r\nusually called a bill of pains and penalties. Such laws are inconsistent\r\nwith the principles of republican government, and are therefore properly\r\nprohibited.\r\n\r\n§6. An _ex post facto_ law is literally a law made after an act is done,\r\nor which has effect upon an act after it is done. But it here means a\r\nlaw that makes punishable as a _crime_, an act which was not criminal\r\nwhen done. A law is also an _ex post facto_ law that increases the\r\npunishment of a crime after it has been committed. If, for example, a\r\nlaw should be passed by which a person, having previously killed another\r\nin lawfully defending his own life, should be made to suffer death, it\r\nwould be an _ex post facto_ law, because killing in self-defense, before\r\nthe passage of the law, was not punishable as a crime. Such also would\r\nbe a law that should require all persons now charged with stealing, to\r\nbe imprisoned for life, if found guilty; because the crime, when\r\ncommitted, was punishable by a shorter imprisonment.\r\n\r\n§7. The next prohibition is, \"No capitation or other direct tax shall be\r\nlaid, unless in proportion to the census or enumeration herein before\r\ndirected to be taken.\" The words _capitation_ and _capital_ are from the\r\nLatin _caput_, the head, or poll. Hence a _capitation-tax_ or a\r\n_poll-tax_, is a tax upon each head or person. (Chap. VII. §4.) The\r\nabove clause means, that poll-taxes, if laid, must be laid in conformity\r\nto article 1st, section 2d, clause 3d, of the constitution, which\r\nrequires three-fifths of the slaves to be counted in apportioning taxes\r\namong the states according to population.\r\n\r\n§8. The next prohibition is, \"No tax or duty shall be laid on articles\r\nexported from any state.\" Probably no law for taxing exports could be\r\ndevised which would operate equally upon the interests of the different\r\nstates. Or some states the principal product is cotton, rice, or\r\ntobacco; of others, grain; and of others, manufactures; and some of\r\nthese products might not bear the same rates of duties as others. But\r\nthough it were possible to devise a plan which would be equal in its\r\noperation, a majority of the representatives might be opposed to it. The\r\nrepresentatives of the grain producing, and those of the planting\r\nstates, might combine in imposing excessive taxes upon the productions\r\nof the manufacturing states. Or the manufacturing and the grain\r\nproducing states might, with the same intent, combine against the\r\nplanting states.\r\n\r\n§9. As it was the purpose of the framers of the constitution to make\r\ntaxation, as nearly as possible, equal in the different states, by\r\nuniform duties; and as every necessary object of indirect taxation may\r\nbe attained by duties on imports; duties on exports are properly\r\nprohibited. And to secure to all the states freedom and equality in\r\ntrade, it is expressly provided in the same clause, that \"no preference\r\nshall be given, by any regulation of commerce or revenue, to the ports\r\nof one state over those of another; nor shall vessels bound to or from\r\none state be obliged to enter, clear, or pay duties in another.\"\r\n\r\n§10. The next clause provides that \"no money shall be drawn from the\r\ntreasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law.\" This places\r\nthe public money beyond the reach or control of the executive or any\r\nother officer, and secures it in the hands of the representatives of the\r\npeople. In pursuance of this provision, congress, at every session,\r\npasses laws specifying the objects for which money is to be\r\nappropriated. The latter part of the clause requires, that \"a regular\r\nstatement and account of the receipts and expenditures of all public\r\nmoney shall be published from time to time.\" And it is by law made the\r\nduty of the secretary of the treasury to make to congress annually such\r\nstatement, which is published by order of congress; so that the people\r\nmay know for what purposes the public money is expended.\r\n\r\n§11. It is next declared, that \"no title of nobility shall be granted by\r\nthe United States.\" Although the bare titles of lord, duke, &c., which\r\nare conferred upon citizens in monarchical governments, could not add to\r\nthe political power of any person under our constitution; yet, as it is\r\ndesirable that there should be equality of rank as well as of political\r\nrights, it is proper that congress should be prohibited from creating\r\ntitles of nobility. And to guard public officers against being corrupted\r\nby foreign influence, they are forbidden to \"accept of any present,\r\nemolument, office, or title of any kind whatever, from any king, prince,\r\nor foreign state.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nProhibitions on the States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. The next section contains restrictions on the powers of the states.\r\n\"No state shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation.\" [For\r\nthe definition of _treaty_ and the manner in which a treaty is made, see\r\nChapter XL: §3-5.] An _alliance_ is a union between two or more nations,\r\nby a treaty, or contract, for their mutual benefit. _Confederation_ and\r\n_alliance_, have nearly the same meaning. If the states, separately,\r\nwere allowed to make treaties or form alliances with foreign powers, the\r\nrights and interests of one state might be injured by the treaties made\r\nby another state. As the states united constitute but one nation, it is\r\nobvious that the power to treat with other nations properly belongs to\r\nthe general government. If the states also had the power, they might\r\ncounteract the policy of the national government.\r\n\r\n§2. Nor may a state \"grant letters of marque and reprisal.\" If, as has\r\nbeen shown, this power is properly given to congress, it could not be\r\nsafely intrusted to the states. (Chap. XXXVI, §5.)\r\n\r\n§3. The power to \"coin money\" is also prohibited to the states. It was\r\ngiven to the general government to secure a uniform currency. (Chap.\r\nXXXIV, §7.) But this object would not be likely to be attained, if the\r\npower to coin money were exercised by the states.\r\n\r\n§4. A state may not \"emit bills of credit.\" _Bills of credit_, to a vast\r\namount, were issued by the states during the war, and for some time\r\nthereafter. They were in the nature of promissory notes, issued by the\r\nauthority of the state, and on the credit of the state, and put in\r\ncirculation by the continental congress and the states as money. This\r\npaper money, having no funds set apart to redeem it, became almost\r\nworthless. Bank bills issued upon the credit of private individuals, do\r\nnot come under the prohibition. It is also held that the prohibition\r\ndoes not apply to the notes or bills of a _state_ bank, drawn on the\r\ncredit of a particular fund set apart for that purpose.\r\n\r\n§5. No state shall \"make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in\r\npayment of debts.\" _Tender_ signifies an offer, or to offer. In law, it\r\nis an offer of something in payment of a debt, or the thing itself which\r\nis offered in payment. Some of the states had declared their\r\nirredeemable paper money a lawful tender. But paper money and property\r\nof all kinds are continually liable to fluctuation in value, and might\r\nsubject those who should be compelled to receive it to great\r\ninconvenience and loss. But although no person is obliged to take in\r\npayment any thing but coin, bank bills are by common consent taken in\r\nthe course of business and in payment of debts, because they may be\r\nconverted into specie by presenting them at the bank by which they are\r\nissued.\r\n\r\n§6. Nor may a state \"pass any bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or\r\nlaw impairing the obligation of contracts.\" Bills of attainder and ex\r\npost laws have been defined and considered. (Chap. XXXVII, §5.) If these\r\nlaws are in their nature wrong, the states as well as congress should be\r\nprohibited from passing them. Not less unjust are laws impairing the\r\nobligation of contracts. Laws that should weaken the force of contracts,\r\nor that would release men from their obligations, would be contrary to\r\nthe principles of justice, and destroy all security to the rights of\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n§7. As bankrupt laws release debtors from the payment of their debts,\r\nand consequently impair the obligation of contracts, the question has\r\narisen whether the states have power to pass insolvent or bankrupt laws.\r\nFrom decisions of the supreme court of the United States, which is the\r\nhighest judicial authority, it appears, that a state may not pass a\r\nbankrupt law discharging a debtor from the obligation of a contract made\r\nbefore such law was passed. But it was not to be considered a law\r\nimpairing the obligation of a contract, if it existed before the\r\ncontract was made; because the parties, who are presumed to know that\r\nsuch law exists, may guard themselves against loss.\r\n\r\n§8. The last thing prohibited in this clause, is, \"to grant any title of\r\nnobility.\" This is forbidden to the states for the same reason as it is\r\nprohibited to congress. (Chap. XXXVII, §11.)\r\n\r\n§9. The first prohibition to the states in the next clause is to \"lay\r\nany imposts or duties on imports or exports, except what may be\r\nabsolutely necessary for executing their inspection laws.\" The\r\nobjections to the power of the states to lay duties have been\r\nconsidered. They are founded upon the same reasons as have been given\r\nfor intrusting congress with this power; one of which is to secure\r\nuniformity throughout the United States. (Chap. XXXII, §6.) And as\r\ncongress is properly prohibited from laying duties on exports, (Chap.\r\nXXXVI, §8, 9,) there can be no good reason for allowing it to be done\r\nby the states.\r\n\r\n§10. The exception allowing a state to lay duties necessary to execute\r\nits inspection laws was deemed proper. Laws are passed by the states for\r\nthe inspection or examination of flour and meat in barrels, leather, and\r\nsundry other commodities in commercial cities, to ascertain their\r\nquality and quantity, and to be marked accordingly. By this means the\r\nstates are enabled to improve the quality of articles produced by the\r\nlabor of the country, and the articles are better fitted for sale, as\r\nthe purchaser is thereby guarded against deception. A small tax is laid\r\nupon the goods inspected, to pay for their inspection. But, lest the\r\nstates should carry this power so far as to injure other states, these\r\n\"laws are to be subject to the revision and control of congress.\"\r\n\r\n§11. The last restrictions upon the power of the states contained in\r\nthis section, are: \"No state shall, without the consent of congress, lay\r\nany duty of tunnage; keep troops or ships of war in time of peace; enter\r\ninto any agreement or compact with any other state, or with a foreign\r\npower; or engage in war, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent\r\ndanger as will not admit of delay.\" Some of the prohibitions here\r\nenumerated have been noticed in this and preceding chapters; and the\r\nreasons of the others are so obvious as to render any remarks upon them\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXIX.\r\n\r\nExecutive Department. President and Vice-President; their Election,\r\nQualifications, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. The second article of the constitution relates to the executive\r\ndepartment. Of the necessity of a separate and distinct power to execute\r\nthe laws, we have already spoken. (Chap. VIII, §7.) Under the\r\nconfederation, as will be recollected, there was no national executive.\r\nThis defect has been supplied by the constitution. \"The executive power\r\nshall be vested in a president of the United States of America. He shall\r\nhold his office during the term of four years, and, together with the\r\nvice-president, chosen for the same term, be elected as follows.\" (Art.\r\n2, §1.)\r\n\r\n§2. In regard to the organization and powers of the executive\r\ndepartment, there was a great diversity of opinion. Ought the chief\r\nexecutive power to be vested in one person, or a number of persons? Laws\r\nshould be executed with promptness and energy. This is more likely to be\r\ndone by one man than by a number. If several were associated in the\r\nexercise of this power, disagreement and discord would be likely to\r\nhappen, and to cause frequent and injurious delays. Unity being deemed\r\nfavorable to energetic and prompt action, the chief executive power of\r\nthe nation was given to a single person.\r\n\r\n§3. Secondly, as to the duration of the office. Much of what has been\r\nsaid in relation to the term of office of senators, will apply to that\r\nof president. (Chap. XXX, §4-6.) His term of office should not be so\r\nshort as to induce him to act more with a view to his re-election than\r\nto the public good; yet it should be short enough to make him feel his\r\nresponsibility. And it should be long enough to insure a due degree of\r\nindependence, and to enable him to carry out his system of public\r\npolicy. The term of four years was accordingly adopted.\r\n\r\n§4. Thirdly, the mode of election. Among the various modes proposed, the\r\none adopted was that of electing the president by electors chosen in the\r\nseveral states for that purpose; the number of the electors chosen in\r\neach state to be equal to the number of its senators and representatives\r\nin congress. A material alteration in the mode of election has been made\r\nsince the adoption of the constitution, as will be seen by examining the\r\ntwo modes. (Art. 2, §1; and Art. 12 of Amendments.) This amendment does\r\nnot change the manner of choosing the electors, but the manner of\r\nchoosing the president by the electors.\r\n\r\n§5. The constitution does not prescribe the manner in which the\r\nelectors shall be appointed or chosen; it only declares that each state\r\nshall appoint them \"in such manner as the legislature thereof shall\r\ndirect.\" No uniform mode was adopted by the different states. In some\r\nstates the electors were appointed by the legislature; in others, by the\r\npeople. At present the latter mode prevails in all the states except\r\nSouth Carolina, where presidential electors are still chosen by the\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\n§6. The electors are, by the laws of the several states, chosen by\r\n_general ticket_. The names of two men, corresponding to the number of\r\nsenators to which a state is entitled in congress, together with the\r\nnames of as many others as there are representatives of the state in the\r\nlower house of congress, one to reside in each congressional district,\r\nare all placed on the same ballot; so that every voter votes for the\r\nwhole number of presidential electors to be chosen in the state. And, by\r\na law of congress, the electors are required to be chosen in all the\r\nstates on the same day, which is the Tuesday next after the first Monday\r\nof November.\r\n\r\n§7. The electors so chosen are required by a law of congress, to meet in\r\ntheir respective states on the first Wednesday of December, and vote for\r\npresident and vice-president; and to make and sign three certificates of\r\nall the votes given by them, and seal up the same. One of these is to be\r\nsent by a person duly appointed by them, to the president of the senate\r\nat the seat of government, before the first of January next ensuing;\r\nanother is to be forwarded by mail, also directed to the president of\r\nthe senate; and the third is to be delivered to the United States judge\r\nof the district in which the electors are assembled.\r\n\r\n§8. On the second Wednesday of February, the president of the senate, in\r\npresence of all the senators and representatives, opens the certificates\r\nfrom all the states, and the votes are counted. The person having a\r\nmajority of all the electoral votes for president is elected. If no\r\nperson has a majority of all the electoral votes, the house of\r\nrepresentatives must choose the president from those candidates, not\r\nexceeding three, who had the highest numbers of the electoral votes. But\r\nin so doing, the members do not all vote together; but those of each\r\nstate vote by themselves; and the candidate who receives the votes of a\r\nmajority of the representatives of a state, has but one presidential\r\nvote for such majority; and the person who receives the votes of a\r\nmajority of the states, is elected. Thus in the election of president by\r\nthe house of representatives, voting is done _by states_, as was done in\r\npassing laws by the old congress. (Chap. XXVIII, §5.)\r\n\r\n§9. There have been two elections by the house of representatives. The\r\nsecond was 1825. The votes of the electoral colleges (assemblies) had in\r\nDecember, 1824, been divided upon four candidates. Andrew Jackson had\r\nreceived 99 electoral votes; John Quincy Adams, 84; William H. Crawford,\r\n41; and Henry Clay, 37. Neither having received a majority of all the\r\nelectoral votes, the election devolved upon the house of\r\nrepresentatives. Of the three candidates who had received the highest\r\nnumbers of the electoral votes, Mr. Adams received in the house of\r\nrepresentatives the votes of thirteen states; Gen. Jackson, the votes of\r\nseven states; and Mr. Crawford, the votes of four states. Mr. Adams\r\nhaving received the votes of a majority of all the states, he was\r\nelected.\r\n\r\n§10. By the 12th article of amendments, if there is no election of\r\nvice-president by a majority of the electors, then, from the two highest\r\nnumbers on the list, the senate shall choose the vice-president.\r\nTwo-thirds of the whole number of senators shall constitute a quorum for\r\nsuch election; and a majority of the whole number shall be necessary to\r\na choice.\r\n\r\n§11. To be eligible to the office of president or vice-president, a\r\nperson must be a natural born citizen of the United States, thirty-five\r\nyears of age, and must have been fourteen years a resident within the\r\nUnited States. The reasons for requiring long terms of citizenship and\r\nresidence, and mature age and experience, in the case of senators, apply\r\nwith equal force in the case of president.\r\n\r\n§12. In case of a vacancy in the office of president, the vice-president\r\nbecomes the president. The power of making further provision for\r\nsupplying vacancies is, by the constitution, given to congress. (Art. 2,\r\n§1.) Congress has accordingly enacted, that, when there is neither\r\npresident nor vice-president, the president _pro tempore_ shall act as\r\npresident; and if there should be none, the speaker of the house of\r\nrepresentatives would assume the duties of the office.\r\n\r\n§13. The same section declares that the salary of the president shall\r\nneither be increased nor diminished during the time for which he shall\r\nhave been elected. It would be improper to allow congress to reduce his\r\nsalary at pleasure. This would make the executive dependent upon the\r\nlegislature for his support. On the other hand, if his compensation\r\ncould be increased during his official term, he might be tempted to use\r\nundue influence to procure a needless increase of his salary.\r\n\r\n§14. The presidential term commences the 4th of March next after the\r\nelection, and ends the 3d day of March four years thereafter. Each\r\nsuccessive congress also commences and ends its term every two years, on\r\nthe same days of that month; and it is called a new congress, although\r\nonly one-third of the senators go out of office when a congress is said\r\nto expire, and are succeeded by new ones when the next congress is said\r\nto commence its official term.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XL.\r\n\r\nPowers and Duties of the President; Treaties; Public Ministers;\r\nAppointments and Removals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. The powers and duties of the president are next given. \"The\r\npresident shall be commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United\r\nStates, and of the militia of the several states when called into the\r\nactual service of the United States.\" (Art. 2, §2.) Some of the reasons\r\nfor giving to the executive the command of the public forces, have been\r\ngiven. (Chap. XXV, §2, 5.) It has also been observed, that a prompt and\r\neffectual execution of the laws is best secured by intrusting this power\r\nto a single individual. (Chap. XXXVIII, §2.) The constitution, (Art. I,\r\n§8, clauses 12-16,) give congress power over the army, navy, and\r\nmilitia, and \"to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the\r\nlaws of the union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions.\" As this\r\npower is to be exercised upon sudden emergencies, congress has by law\r\nauthorized the president to call out the militia for these purposes. And\r\nas the direction of the public forces is a power of an executive nature,\r\nit is intrusted to the executive.\r\n\r\n§2. The president has also \"power to grant reprieves and pardons for\r\noffenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.\" The\r\nsame power is exercised by the governors of the several states. (Chap.\r\nXII, §4.) Through partial or false testimony, or the mistakes of judges\r\nor juries, an innocent person may be convicted of crime; or facts may\r\nsubsequently come to light showing the offense to be one of less\r\naggravation than appeared on the trial. There should therefore be\r\nsomewhere a power to remit the punishment, or to mitigate the sentence,\r\nor postpone its execution, as the case may seem to require; and by no\r\nother person or persons, it is presumed, would this power be more\r\njudiciously exercised than by the executive.\r\n\r\n§3. The president has \"power, by and with the advice and consent of the\r\nsenate, to make treaties, to appoint embassadors, other public ministers\r\nand consuls, judges of the supreme court,\" and other officers, \"provided\r\ntwo-thirds of the senators concur.\" A _treaty_ is an agreement or\r\ncontract between two or more nations, for regulating trade, or for\r\nrestoring or preserving peace. This power ought therefore to be in the\r\nnational government. In monarchical governments it belongs to the king.\r\nTo confide so important a trust to the president alone, would be\r\nimprudent. To associate the house of representatives with the president\r\nand senate, as in making laws, would render it impossible to act with\r\nthe decision, secrecy, and dispatch, which are sometimes necessary in\r\nmaking treaties.\r\n\r\n§4. As the treaty-making power appears to be in its nature neither\r\nwholly executive nor wholly legislative, but to partake of the nature of\r\nboth, a _part_ of the legislature is properly associated with the\r\npresident. As the senate, being less numerous than the house, is capable\r\nof acting more promptly as well as more easily convened and at less\r\nexpense, that body is more properly united with the executive in the\r\nexercise of this power. And it is equally proper that the power to\r\nappoint embassadors and others by whom treaties are negotiated, should\r\nbe placed in the same hands.\r\n\r\n§5. Treaties are negotiated; that is, the provisions or terms are\r\narranged and agreed upon, by the agents of the two governments; and a\r\ncopy of the articles of agreement is sent to each government to be\r\napproved and confirmed, or, as it is usually expressed, to be\r\n_ratified_. Both governments must ratify, or the treaty fails. Treaties\r\nare ratified, on the part of our government, by the president and\r\nsenate. This is what is meant by their making treaties. The persons by\r\nwhom treaties are negotiated are sometimes appointed by their\r\ngovernments for that special purpose; but the business is perhaps more\r\nfrequently done by the permanent representatives or ministers of the\r\nrespective governments.\r\n\r\n§6. Each of the principal civilized nations has some officer at home\r\nwho acts as agent in negotiating treaties and transacting business with\r\nforeign governments, and has also a representative at the seat of each\r\nforeign government for this purpose, and for keeping his government,\r\napprised of what is done abroad. Our government has a minister in Great\r\nBritain, one in Russia, one in France, one in Spain, and one in each of\r\nthe other principal commercial nations; and each of these nations has a\r\nminister residing at the city of Washington, the seat of government of\r\nthe United States. The officer of our government who corresponds with\r\nforeign ministers here, and with our ministers abroad, is the secretary\r\nof state. The negotiation of treaties at home with the ministers of\r\nforeign governments residing here, is done by him.\r\n\r\n§7. Representatives at foreign courts have different names or titles:\r\nembassadors, envoys, ministers, and chargès des affaires. An embassador\r\nwho is intrusted with the ordinary business of a minister at a foreign\r\ncourt, is called an _embassador in ordinary_. An _embassador\r\nextraordinary_ is a person sent on a particular occasion, who returns as\r\nsoon as the business on which he was sent is done. He is sometimes\r\ncalled _envoy_; and when he has power to act as he may deem expedient,\r\nhe is called _envoy plenipotentiary_; the latter word signifying full\r\npower. An ordinary embassador or minister resides abroad, and acts in\r\nobedience to instructions sent him from time to time.\r\n\r\n§8. Agents or representatives sent by our government to reside at\r\nforeign courts, are called _ministers_. Formerly those sent to the less\r\nimportant countries, were called _chargès des affaires_, who are\r\nministers of a lower grade. The name, usually written chargès\r\nd'affaires, is French, and is pronounced _shar-zha-daf-fair_, accented\r\non the first and last syllables. It means a person having charge of the\r\naffairs of his nation. It is not at present applied to any of our\r\nrepresentatives abroad, all being called by the common name of minister.\r\n\r\n§9. _Consuls_ are agents of inferior grade. They reside in foreign\r\nseaports. Their business is to aid their respective governments in their\r\ncommercial transactions with the countries in which they reside, and to\r\nprotect the rights, commerce, merchants, and seamen of their own nation.\r\nHence much of their business is with masters of vessels, and with\r\nmerchants. They also dispose of the personal estate of citizens of their\r\nown nation who die within their consulates, leaving no representative or\r\npartner in trade to take care of their effects.\r\n\r\n§10. The appointment of judges of the supreme court by the president and\r\nsenate, seems to be proper. Their election by the people, most of whom\r\ncould have little or no knowledge of the persons who should be chosen,\r\nwould be injudicious. Besides, the mass of the voters are not so\r\ncompetent to judge of the qualifications necessary for so important a\r\njudicial office, as those to whom the constitution has given the power\r\nof appointment.\r\n\r\n§11. The power of appointing the head officers of the several executive\r\ndepartments, is with equal propriety given to the president and senate.\r\nAs the president is in a measure responsible for the acts of his\r\nsubordinates who conduct the business of these departments, and as,\r\nwithout their coöperation, he could scarcely carry out his own measures,\r\nit is proper that he should have the right of selecting them; and by\r\nbeing required to submit his choice to the body of senators for their\r\napproval, a sufficient safeguard is provided against the appointment of\r\nunworthy or incompetent men.\r\n\r\n§12. \"The president shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may\r\nhappen during the recess of the senate, by granting commissions which\r\nshall expire at the end of the next session.\" (Art. 2, sec. 2, clause\r\n3.) Without such a power somewhere, the public interests would often\r\nsuffer serious injury before the senate should again be in session to\r\nact upon a nomination by the president. As it is his duty to see that\r\nthe business of the executive offices is faithfully done, he seems to\r\nbe the proper person to make such temporary appointment.\r\n\r\n§13. The powers and duties of the president enumerated in the next\r\nsection of the constitution, are all necessary to insure a successful\r\nadministration of the government; and they are so clearly of an\r\nexecutive nature, that they could not with any degree of propriety have\r\nbeen devolved upon any other officer or department of the government.\r\n\r\n§14. The last section of this article of the constitution enumerates the\r\npersons liable to be removed from office by impeachment, and the\r\noffenses for which they are thus removable. As in the state governments,\r\nso in the general government, impeachments are made by the house of\r\nrepresentatives, and tried by the senate. (Chap. XX, §6-8; Cons. U.S.,\r\nart. I, §2, 3.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLI.\r\n\r\nAuxiliary Executive Departments. Departments of State, of the Treasury,\r\nof the Interior, of War, of the Navy, of the Post-Office;\r\nAttorney-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. The great amount and variety of the executive business of the\r\nnation, requires the division of this department into several\r\nsubordinate departments, and the distribution among them of the\r\ndifferent kinds of public business. At the head of each of these\r\ndepartments is a chief officer. These chief officers, sometimes called\r\n_heads of departments_, with the attorney general, being private\r\nadvisors or counselors of the president, are called the _cabinet_. They\r\nare appointed by the president and senate.\r\n\r\n§2. By the first congress under the constitution, were established the\r\nstate, treasury, and war departments, whose head officers, called\r\nsecretaries, and the attorney-general, constituted the first cabinet.\r\nIn 1798, the navy department was established. During president Jackson's\r\nterm of office, the postmaster-general was made a cabinet officer. And\r\nthe establishment, in 1849, of the department of the interior, added to\r\nthe cabinet the seventh member.\r\n\r\n§3. The _secretary of state_ performs such duties as are committed to\r\nhim by the president relating to foreign intercourse. Some of these\r\nduties have been mentioned. (Chap. XXXIX, §6.) He conducts all our\r\ndiplomatic correspondence, being the official organ of communication\r\nwith the ministers of foreign governments sent to this country, and with\r\nour ministers abroad. _Diplomacy_ signifies the rules and customs which\r\ngovern the intercourse of nations through their ministers or agents;\r\nalso the management of the business of a nation by its minister at a\r\nforeign court. And such minister, especially if he manages with ability\r\nand skill, is called a _diplomatist_.\r\n\r\n§4. The secretary of state keeps the seal of the United States; and he\r\nmakes out, records, and seals all civil commissions to officers\r\nappointed by the president and senate, or by the president. His duties\r\nin relation to the publishing and distributing the laws, and certain\r\nother matters, are similar to the duties of a secretary of state of a\r\nstate government.\r\n\r\n§5. The _secretary of the treasury_ has charge of the finances of the\r\nnation. He superintends the collection of the revenue, and performs\r\ncertain other duties of the nature of the controller or auditor of a\r\nstate. (Chap. XIII, §3.) He lays before congress annually a report of\r\nthe finances, containing a statement of the public revenue and\r\nexpenditure during the past year, the value of the imports and exports,\r\nand estimates of the revenue and expenditures for succeeding years, and\r\nplans for improving the revenues. He also makes annually a statement of\r\nappropriations of money, and of sums remaining, in the treasury.\r\n\r\n§6. The vast amount of business in this department requires a great\r\nnumber of assistants; among whom are several controllers and auditors of\r\naccounts; a treasurer, a register, who keeps the accounts of goods\r\nimported and exported, and of the shipping employed in our foreign\r\ntrade; a solicitor; a recorder; and numerous clerks.\r\n\r\n§7. The _secretary of the interior_ superintends the business relating\r\nto the public lands, public buildings, the lead mines and other mines of\r\nthe United States, Indian affairs, patents, and pensions. A _pension_ is\r\na yearly allowance to a person by the government for past services. In\r\nthis country pensions are granted for services in war. They were at\r\nfirst allowed only to such as had been disabled in the war of the\r\nrevolution and in the war of 1812; and subsequently to all who had\r\nserved at least six months in the revolutionary war, and to their widows\r\nduring their lives. Those disabled in the late war with Mexico have also\r\nbeen added to the pension list. And by recent acts of congress, bounties\r\nof lands were to be allowed to all the surviving soldiers of the war of\r\n1812, who had served one month therein.\r\n\r\n§8. The _secretary of war_ performs duties relating to military\r\ncommissions, or to the land forces and warlike stores of the United\r\nStates. The standing army of the nation consists at present of about\r\n15,000 men, who are distributed among the several military stations,\r\narmed and ready for service. He reports annually a statement of the\r\nexpenditure and application of moneys drawn from the treasury for his\r\ndepartment, and makes such suggestions relative to its condition as he\r\nthinks proper. He is assisted by subordinate officers and clerks.\r\n\r\n§9. The _secretary of the navy_ executes the orders of the president for\r\nprocuring naval stores and materials, and for equipping and employing\r\nvessels of war, and performs such other duties pertaining to the naval\r\nestablishment as are required of him. Three officers are appointed by\r\nthe president and senate, who constitute a board of _commissioners for\r\nthe navy_, and discharge the ministerial duties of the office of the\r\nsecretary, and furnish estimates of the expenditures of the department.\r\n\r\n§10. The _postmaster-general_ establishes post-offices, appoints\r\npostmasters and other persons employed in the general post-office, and\r\nprovides for carrying the mails. He is assisted by three assistant\r\npost-masters-general, an auditor of the post-office treasury, to audit\r\nand settle the accounts of the department, and to superintend the\r\ncollection of the debts due the department. The business of this\r\ndepartment requires a large number of clerks. He reports annually all\r\ncontracts made for the transportation of the mail, and a statement of\r\nthe receipts and expenditures of the department.\r\n\r\n§11. Postmasters keep an account of all letters sent from and received\r\nat their respective offices, stating the names of the offices from which\r\nletters are received, and of those to which letters are sent, and\r\nwhether they are post paid or sent free. Postmasters, at stated periods,\r\n(in most places quarterly,) advertise all letters remaining in their\r\noffices; and they send quarterly to the general post-office accounts of\r\nletters sent and received, and of moneys received for postage, and of\r\nthose paid out on orders of the department. Letters also which have lain\r\nin their offices during the time for which they were required to be\r\nadvertised, are sent as _dead_ letters to the general post-office, where\r\nthey are opened; and such as contain money or other valuable matter are\r\nreturned by mail to the writers.\r\n\r\n§12. Postmasters are allowed for their services a commission on the\r\namount of postage received by them quarterly. Those at whose offices the\r\nsums received are small, are allowed a greater per centage than those\r\nwhere the receipts are large. Thus, the commission at present (1859) is,\r\non the first $100 received, sixty per cent.; on the next $300, fifty per\r\ncent.; on the next $2,000, forty per cent.; on all over 2,400, fifteen\r\nper cent. Stamped letters are considered as paid in cash. On newspaper\r\npostages, fifty per cent, on all sums, large or small. If a postmaster's\r\ncommission exceeds $2,000 a year, besides the expenses of the office,\r\nthe excess is paid to the general post office. Postmasters may also\r\nreceive for pigeon-holes or boxes, not exceeding $2,000, the excess, if\r\nany, to be paid to the general post-office. Postmasters whose\r\ncompensation amounts to $1,000 or more in a year, are appointed by the\r\npresident and senate.\r\n\r\n§13. Postmasters whose commission on postages has been less than $200\r\nduring the preceding year, may receive and send, free of postage,\r\nletters on their own private business, weighing not more than half an\r\nounce. And members of congress, during their term of office, and until\r\nthe first of December after its expiration, may send and receive letters\r\nand packages weighing not more than two ounces, and all public documents\r\nfree. A person to be entitled to send matter free, must write on the\r\noutside his name and the title of his office. This is called _franking_.\r\nCivil officers at the seat of government also may frank matter relating\r\nto the business of their offices, by marking it outside, \"official\r\nbusiness.\"\r\n\r\n§14. The _attorney-general_ attends to all suits in the supreme court of\r\nthe United States in which the United States is a party or is concerned,\r\nand gives his opinions on questions of law when requested by the\r\npresident or heads of departments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLII.\r\n\r\nJudicial Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. We come now to the third article of the constitution. The first two\r\nsections provide for the organization, and prescribe the powers, of the\r\ncourts of the United States. The want of a national judiciary was a\r\nmaterial defect of the confederation. Dependence upon the state courts\r\nto enforce the laws of the union, subjected the government to great\r\ninconvenience and embarrassment. A government that has a legislature\r\nand an executive, should also have a judiciary to judge of and interpret\r\nthe laws. The constitution declares that \"the judicial power of the\r\nUnited States shall be vested in one supreme court, and in such inferior\r\ncourts as the congress may ordain and establish.\" Under the authority\r\nhere given, congress passed the judiciary act of 1789, by which the\r\nseveral courts of the United States were established.\r\n\r\n§2. The same section declares, \"The judges of both the supreme and\r\ninferior courts shall hold their offices during good behavior.\" In no\r\nother department of the general government are offices held for so long\r\na term, which is virtually for life, unless removed on impeachment, or\r\nfor inability. To insure a correct and impartial administration of\r\njustice, the judges should be independent. If they could be displaced at\r\nthe pleasure of the appointing power, or by frequent elections, they\r\nmight be tempted to conform their opinions and decisions to the wishes\r\nof those on whom they were dependent for continuance in office. The\r\nobject of the framers was to remove them as far as possible from party\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\n§3. It is further provided, with a view to the independence of the\r\njudges, that their \"compensation shall not be diminished during their\r\ncontinuance in office.\" Salaries are fixed by congress. To give congress\r\npower over the purse of an officer, is to give it power over his will.\r\nDependence upon the legislature would be as great an evil as dependence\r\nupon the appointing power. Besides, men generally selected for high\r\njudicial offices are eminent lawyers, pursuing a lucrative professional\r\nbusiness; and, without a liberal salary, men of the greatest ability\r\nwould not accept these offices; or if in office, an essential reduction\r\nof their compensation might induce them to resign their offices.\r\n\r\n§4. The next section enumerates the cases to be tried in these courts.\r\nIt is evident from their nature that state courts are not the proper\r\ntribunals to try them. Also all violations of the laws of the United\r\nStates are tried in the national courts. Thus, the counterfeiting of\r\nUnited States coin, murder and other crimes committed on the sea, beyond\r\nthe jurisdiction of a state, smuggling goods, that is, secretly\r\nimporting dutiable goods without paying the duties, infringements of\r\npatent rights, &c., are prosecuted in courts of the United States.\r\n\r\n§5. The third clause of this section declares, that \"the trial of all\r\ncrimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury; and such trial\r\nshall be held in the same state where the said crimes shall have been\r\ncommitted.\" This is intended to secure the trial of the accused among\r\nhis friends and acquaintances, and near the residence of his witnesses,\r\nwhose attendance in a distant state could not be had without great\r\ninconvenience and expense, which might deprive him of the benefit of an\r\nimportant witness.\r\n\r\n§6. There are three kinds of national courts: the supreme court, circuit\r\ncourts, and district courts. Every state constitutes at least one\r\ndistrict. The larger states are divided into two or more districts. In\r\neach district is a _district judge_, who holds a court four times a\r\nyear. There are also in each district, a _district attorney_, to conduct\r\nsuits on the part of the United States, and a _marshal_, whose business\r\nis similar to that of a sheriff. This court tries the more common civil\r\ncases, arising under the laws of the United States, and the lower crimes\r\nagainst the laws of the United States, committed on land and sea. This\r\ncourt has in some cases a jury.\r\n\r\n§7. There are nine _circuits_, each embracing several states. In each\r\ncircuit is a justice or a judge, who holds a court in his circuit twice\r\na year. The district judge of the district in which a circuit court is\r\nheld, sits with the circuit judge in holding a circuit court. This court\r\ntries causes between citizens of different states, between aliens and\r\ncitizens, and those in which the United States are a party. It also\r\ntries some cases in appeal from the district courts. It tries matters\r\nrelating to affairs on the high seas, and all felonies punishable with\r\ndeath. It has a grand and a petit jury.\r\n\r\n§8. The _supreme court_ is composed of the nine judges of the circuit\r\ncourts, one of whom is chief-justice, the others are called associate\r\njustices. It holds one session annually at the seat of government,\r\ncommencing in January or February, and continuing about two months. It\r\nwill be seen from this section of the constitution, that this court has\r\n_original_ jurisdiction in but few cases. Its principal business is to\r\nrejudge cases brought up from the circuit courts.\r\n\r\n§9. An important object of a supreme court of the United States, is to\r\nsecure a correct and uniform interpretation of the constitution and laws\r\nof the United States. State laws and decisions of state courts, are\r\nsometimes made which are supposed to be repugnant to the constitution\r\nand laws of the United States. What may be pronounced constitutional in\r\none state, may be declared unconstitutional in another. Therefore it is\r\nprovided that when an act or judgment in a case tried in the highest or\r\nlast court in a state is deemed inconsistent with the constitution or\r\nlaws of the United States, such case may be removed to the supreme court\r\nof the United States, whose decision governs the judgment of all\r\ninferior courts throughout the union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLIII.\r\n\r\nTreason, defined; its Punishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. The constitution defines treason, as follows: \"Treason against the\r\nUnited States shall consist only in levying war against them, or in\r\nadhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort.\" Art. 3, sec. 3.\r\nA proneness to construe less aggravated crimes into acts of treason,\r\nmade it proper that the constitution should define the crime. The term\r\n_levying war_ has the sense here which it was understood to have in the\r\nEnglish statute, from which it was adopted. An assemblage of men for a\r\ntreasonable purpose, such as war against the government, or a revolution\r\nof any of its territories, and in a condition to make such war,\r\nconstitutes a levying of war.\r\n\r\n§2. War can be levied only by the employment of force; troops must be\r\nembodied; men must be openly raised; but there may be treason without\r\narms, or without the application of force to the object. When war is\r\nlevied, all who perform a part, however remote from the scene of action,\r\nbeing leagued in the conspiracy, commit treason. But a mere conspiracy\r\nto levy war is not treason. A secret, unarmed meeting of conspirators,\r\nnot in force, nor in warlike form, though met for a treasonable purpose,\r\nis not treason; but these offenses are high misdemeanors.\r\n\r\n§3. The constitution also prescribes the proof necessary for the\r\nconviction of treason. \"No person shall be convicted of treason, unless\r\non the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on\r\nconfession in open court.\" No evidence less than this should be\r\nconsidered sufficient to convict a person of a crime for which he is to\r\nsuffer death.\r\n\r\n§4. \"Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason.\"\r\nArt. 3, sec. 3. By the common law, the punishment of treason was of a\r\nsavage and disgraceful nature. The offender was drawn to the gallows on\r\na hurdle; hanged by the neck and cut down alive; his entrails taken out\r\nand burned while he was yet alive; his head cut off; and his body\r\nquartered. Congress, in pursuance of the power here granted, has very\r\nproperly abolished this barbarous practice, and confined the punishment\r\nto simple death by hanging.\r\n\r\n§5. But the same clause provides, that \"no attainder of treason shall\r\nwork corruption of blood, or forfeiture, except during the life of the\r\nperson attainted.\" _Attainder_ literally signifies a staining, or\r\nrendering impure; but it here means a conviction and judgment in court\r\nagainst the offender. By the common law, the sentence of death for\r\ntreason was made to affect the _blood_ of the traitor; so that he could\r\nneither inherit property nor transmit it to heirs; but his estate was\r\nforfeited. This practice, so unjust to the innocent relatives of an\r\noffender, is properly abolished by the constitution; and congress has\r\ndeclared that \"no conviction or judgment shall work corruption of blood,\r\nor any forfeiture of estate.\" So that while this law continues, there is\r\nno forfeiture, even during the life of the person attainted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLIV.\r\n\r\nState Records; Privilege of Citizens; Fugitives; Admission of New\r\nStates; Power over Territory; Guaranty of Republican Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. \"Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public\r\nacts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state. And the\r\ncongress may, by general laws, prescribe the manner in which such acts,\r\nrecords, and proceedings shall be proved and the effect thereof.\" Art.\r\n4, sec. 1. Without this provision, a person against whom a judgment has\r\nbeen obtained, might remove with his property into another state, where\r\nthe property could not be taken on execution without a new trial and\r\njudgment; which, at so great a distance from the residence of the\r\ncreditor and his witnesses, would be very difficult and expensive, and\r\nperhaps impossible. Now, the proceedings of the court in which a\r\njudgment is obtained, if sent to the place where the debtor resides,\r\nhave the same effect as in the state in which such proceedings were\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n§2. There are several other cases which this provision is intended to\r\nmeet. But, as is seen, the effect of these acts, records, and judicial\r\nproceedings, and the manner of proving them are to be prescribed by\r\ncongress. In pursuance of the power here granted, congress has enacted,\r\nthat a certificate under seal of the clerk of a court of record,\r\ntransmitted to any state of the union, shall there be deemed evidence\r\nof the facts therein stated. But if the thing certified is a judicial\r\nproceeding, such sealed certificate must be accompanied by the\r\ncertificate of the presiding judge or justice, that the attestation of\r\nthe clerk is in due form. Acts of a state legislature, to be entitled to\r\ncredit in another state, must have the seal of the state affixed to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n§3. The next section of this article provides, that \"the citizens of\r\neach state shall be entitled to all the immunities and privileges of\r\ncitizens in the several states.\" This means that the citizens of any\r\nstate going into other states, shall not, by the laws of those states,\r\nbe deprived of any of the privileges of citizens; but shall be entitled\r\nto the privileges which are enjoyed by persons of the same description\r\nin the states to which they remove. Without such a provision, any state\r\nmight deny to citizens coming into it from other states, the right to\r\nbuy and hold real estate, or to become voters, or to enjoy equal\r\nprivileges in trade or business. A state may, however, prescribe a\r\ncertain term of residence therein as a qualification for voting at\r\nelections.\r\n\r\n§4. The next clause of this section provides for apprehending \"a person\r\ncharged with crime, who shall flee from justice and be found in another\r\nstate.\" The governor of the state from which such person has fled, sends\r\na requisition to the governor of the state in which he is found,\r\ndemanding his delivery to the proper officers, to be conveyed back for\r\ntrial. Without such authority to apprehend criminals, they might escape\r\njustice by taking shelter in another state.\r\n\r\n§5. In the same section it is provided, that \"no person held to service\r\nor labor in one state, under the laws thereof, escaping into another,\r\nshall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged\r\nfrom such service or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the\r\nparty to whom such service or labor may be due.\" This clause was\r\nintended for the benefit of the slaveholding states. By the common law,\r\na slave escaping into a non-slaveholding state became free. As it was\r\npresumed that other northern states would follow Massachusetts in\r\nabolishing slavery, the southern states wanted some provision to enable\r\nthem to reclaim their fugitive slaves.\r\n\r\n§6. The manner in which slaves are to be reclaimed, is prescribed by an\r\nact of congress. The owner of a runaway slave, finding him in a free\r\nstate, arrests him and brings him before a magistrate; and if he proves\r\nhis title to the slave to the satisfaction of the magistrate, the slave\r\nis delivered to the owner or claimant. Free colored persons have\r\nsometimes been arrested, and, on false testimony, delivered to\r\nclaimants, taken to slave states and held as slaves. Hence the opinion\r\nprevails extensively that a person claimed as a slave should be entitled\r\nto trial by a jury; and that the fact of his being a slave should be\r\nproved to the satisfaction of a jury before his delivery to a claimant.\r\nMany persons, believing freedom to be the natural right of all men, hold\r\nthat all laws for returning fugitive slaves are wrong, and ought not to\r\nbe obeyed.\r\n\r\n§7. The first clause of the next section provides, that \"new states may\r\nbe admitted into this union,\" and requires the consent of congress and\r\nof the states concerned, to the formation of new states from old ones. A\r\nprovision of this kind was deemed necessary in view of the large extent\r\nof vacant lands within the United States, and of the inconvenient size\r\nof some of the states then existing. The territory north-west of the\r\nOhio river had been ceded to the general government by the states\r\nclaiming the same; and a territorial government had already been\r\nestablished therein by the celebrated ordinance of 1787. From this\r\nterritory have since been formed and admitted, the states of Ohio,\r\nIndiana, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin.\r\n\r\n§8. South of the Ohio river also was a large tract, principally\r\nunsettled, within the chartered limits of Virginia, North Carolina and\r\nGeorgia, extending west to the Mississippi river, from which, it was\r\npresumed, new states would be formed. Justice, however, to these states,\r\nas well as to others in all future time, required the general provision\r\nabove mentioned, that \"no state should be divided without the consent of\r\nits legislature and of congress.\"\r\n\r\n§9. The next clause authorizes congress \"to dispose of and make all\r\nneedful rules and regulations respecting the territory and other\r\nproperty of the United States.\" If the general government has power to\r\nacquire territory, it must have the right to exercise authority over it.\r\nThis express grant establishes beyond doubt a power which had been\r\nquestioned under the confederation. In pursuance of the power here\r\ngranted, congress has made rules and regulations for governing the\r\npeople of different portions of such territory previously to their\r\nadmission as states into the union.\r\n\r\n§10. The next section declares, that \"the United States shall guaranty\r\nto every state in this union a republican form of government; and shall\r\nprotect each of them against invasion, and on the application of the\r\nlegislature, or of the executive (when the legislature cannot be\r\nconvened,) against domestic violence.\" Art. 4, sec. 4. The propriety of\r\na power to prevent a state from changing its government to any other\r\nthan a republican form, is evident. It is equally proper that a state,\r\nwhen invaded by a foreign enemy, or in case of an insurrection within\r\nits own borders, should have protection and aid from the general\r\ngovernment; especially as the states have surrendered to it the right to\r\nkeep troops or ships of war in time of peace. (Art. 1, sec. 10.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLV.\r\n\r\nProvision for Amendments; Assumption of Public Debts; Supremacy of the\r\nConstitution, &c.; Oaths and Tests; Ratification of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. The 5th article provides for amending the constitution. It\r\nprescribes two different modes for proposing amendments, and two modes\r\nof ratifying them. Amendments may be proposed by two-thirds of both\r\nhouses of congress; or, on the application or request of two-thirds of\r\nthe states, congress shall call a convention for proposing amendments.\r\nProposed in either of these modes, amendments, to become valid as parts\r\nof the constitution, must be ratified by the legislatures of\r\nthree-fourths of the states, or by conventions in three-fourths of them;\r\nthe mode of ratification, whether by the legislatures or by conventions,\r\nto be proposed by congress.\r\n\r\n§2. As the best human government is imperfect, and as all the future\r\nwants and necessities of a people can not be foreseen and provided for,\r\nit is obvious that every constitution should contain some provision for\r\nits amendment. But if amendments could be made whenever desired by a\r\nbare majority of the states, the strength and efficiency of the\r\nconstitution might be greatly impaired by frequent alterations. It is\r\ntherefore wisely provided, that a mere proposition to amend cannot be\r\nmade but by a majority of at least two-thirds of congress, or of the\r\nlegislatures of at least of two-thirds of the states; and that such\r\nproposition must be ratified by a still larger majority (three-fourths)\r\nof the states. It was thought better to submit occasionally to some\r\ntemporary inconvenience, than to indulge in frequent amendments of the\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\n§3. The 6th article acknowledges the obligation of the general\r\ngovernment to pay \"all debts contracted before the adoption of the\r\nconstitution.\" As has been observed, congress had borrowed money for the\r\npayment of which it was unable to provide; and one object of a change\r\nof government was to make provision for fulfilling the engagements of\r\nthe nation. This clause, it is said, was also intended to allay the\r\nfears of public creditors, who apprehended that a change in the\r\ngovernment would release the nation from its obligations.\r\n\r\n§4. The next clause declares, \"This constitution, and the laws made in\r\npursuance thereof, and all treaties made under the authority of the\r\nUnited States, shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in\r\nevery state shall be bound thereby, any thing in the constitution or\r\nlaws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.\" If all state\r\nauthorities were not bound by the constitution and laws of the United\r\nStates, nothing would have been gained by the union. If the laws and\r\ntreaties made by the general government could be disregarded or\r\nnullified by any power in a state, why was power to make them given to\r\nthe general government?\r\n\r\n§5. The last clause of the 4th article requires certain officers, both\r\nof the United States and of the several states to be \"bound by oath or\r\naffirmation to support this constitution.\" Binding the conscience of\r\npublic officers by oath or solemn affirmation, has ever been considered\r\nnecessary to secure a faithful performance of their duties. They are\r\ngenerally required to swear not only to support the constitution, but\r\nalso to discharge the duties of their offices to the best of their\r\nability.\r\n\r\n§6. The same clause declares that \"no religious test shall ever be\r\nrequired as a qualification to any office or public trust under the\r\nUnited States.\" _Test_ here means an oath or a declaration in favor of\r\nor against certain religious opinions, as a qualification for office. In\r\nEngland, all officers, civil and military, were formerly obliged to make\r\na declaration against transubstantiation, and to assent to the doctrines\r\nand conform to the rules of the established church. Desirous of securing\r\nto every citizen the full enjoyment of religious liberty, the\r\nintroduction of tests was prohibited by the constitution.\r\n\r\n§7. The 7th and last article declares: \"The ratification of the\r\nconventions of nine states shall be sufficient for the establishment of\r\nthis constitution between the states so ratifying the same.\" The\r\nimmediate ratification of the constitution by all the states was hardly\r\nto be expected; a unanimous ratification, therefore, was not required.\r\nBut a union of less than nine states was deemed inexpedient. The framers\r\nconcluded their labors on the 17th of September, 1787; and in July,\r\n1788, the ratification of New Hampshire, the ninth state, was received\r\nby congress.\r\n\r\n§8. The dates of the ratifications of the several states are as follows:\r\nDelaware, December 7, 1787; Pennsylvania, December 12, 1787; New Jersey,\r\nDecember 18, 1787; Georgia, January 2, 1788; Connecticut, January 9,\r\n1788; Massachusetts, February 6, 1788; Maryland, April 28, 1788; South\r\nCarolina, May 23, 1788; New Hampshire, June 21, 1788; Virginia, June 26,\r\n1788; New York, July 26, 1788; North Carolina, November 21, 1789; Rhode\r\nIsland, May 29, 1790. The two last named states did not accede to the\r\nconstitution until after proceedings under it had commenced. The\r\nratification of North Carolina was received by congress in January,\r\n1790; that of Rhode Island in June following.\r\n\r\n§9. The first Wednesday of January, 1789, was appointed by congress for\r\nchoosing electors of president in the several states, and the first\r\nWednesday of February for the electors to meet in their respective\r\nstates to elect the president. Gen. Washington was unanimously elected,\r\nand on the 30th of April was inaugurated president. Proceedings under\r\nthe constitution, however, had commenced on the 4th of March preceding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLVI.\r\n\r\nAmendments to the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. It is remarkable that, during a period of seventy years, the\r\nconstitution has received so few alterations. Although twelve articles\r\nof amendment, so called, have been adopted, only two, (the 11th and\r\n12th,) have in any manner or degree changed any of its original\r\nprovisions. Most of them, it will be seen, are merely declaratory and\r\nrestrictive. As the principles which they declare were so generally\r\nacknowledged, and as the general government was a government of limited\r\npowers, having such only as were expressly authorized by the\r\nconstitution, the framers deemed these declarations and restrictions\r\nunnecessary. But as several of the state conventions had, at the time of\r\nadopting the constitution, expressed a desire that declarations and\r\nguaranties of certain rights should be added, in order to prevent\r\nmisconstruction and abuse, the first congress, at its first session,\r\nproposed twelve amendments, ten of which were ratified by the requisite\r\nnumber of states. Virginia, the last state necessary to make up such\r\nnumber, ratified December 15, 1791.\r\n\r\n§2. Freedom in matters of religion, freedom of speech and of the press,\r\nand the right to petition the government for the redress of grievances,\r\nguarantied in the first article, are rights so essential to civil\r\nliberty, and so evidently just, that it can hardly be presumed that\r\ncongress would ever have passed laws directly violating these rights,\r\neven though such laws had not been prohibited.\r\n\r\n§3. The second article guaranties \"the right of people to bear arms.\"\r\nWithout this right, ambitious men might, by the aid of the regular army,\r\noverthrow the liberties of the people, and usurp the powers of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n§4. The third article declares, that \"no soldier shall, in time of\r\npeace, be quartered in any house without the consent of the owner, nor\r\nin time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.\" It is a\r\nprinciple of the common law, that \"a man's house is his own castle.\"\r\nAmong the grievances enumerated in the Declaration of Independence, was\r\none \"for quartering large bodies of armed troops\" among the people of\r\nthe colonies. To secure the people against intrusions of this kind, is\r\nthe object of this prohibition.\r\n\r\n§5. The fourth article guaranties \"the right of the people to be secure\r\nin their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable\r\nsearches and seizures.\" But there could be no such security, if every\r\nman could, on mere pretense or suspicion of injury, obtain a warrant for\r\narresting his neighbor or searching his premises and seizing his\r\nproperty. Innocent men would often be subjected to much trouble and\r\nperplexity; and unjust suspicions would be thrown upon their characters.\r\nIt is proper, therefore, that a magistrate shall not issue a warrant,\r\nunless it shall be made to appear, by the oath of the applicant or of\r\nsome other person that there is probable cause.\r\n\r\n§6. The rights guarantied by the fifth article are common law rights,\r\nand founded upon just principles. We have elsewhere stated the object of\r\ngrand juries, and noticed the opinion of some, that this object is\r\nsufficiently secured by the examination before the magistrate; and,\r\nconsequently, that grand juries are unnecessary. (See Chap. XIX, §8-10.)\r\nBut while this article continues to be a part of the constitution, grand\r\njuries in courts of the United States can not be dispensed with. It is\r\nquite proper, as is provided in this article, that, after a fair and\r\nimpartial trial and an acquittal, a person should not be tried a second\r\ntime. The provisions of the next article (6th) are also necessary to\r\nsecure the same object--the rights of liberty and life to every citizen.\r\n\r\n§7. The seventh article of amendment secures, in courts of the United\r\nStates, \"in suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall\r\nexceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury.\" By suits at common\r\nlaw are meant those tried in the ordinary courts, as distinguished from\r\nthose tried in courts of equity and courts of admiralty. This article\r\nfurther declares, that \"no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise\r\nreëxamined in any court of the United States, than according to the\r\nrules of the common law.\" That is, if a fact tried by a jury in a lower\r\ncourt, is carried up to a higher court for reëxamination, such\r\nreëxamination or new trial shall also be by jury.\r\n\r\n§8. \"Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed,\r\nnor unusual punishments inflicted.\" Amend. art. 8. The object of bail\r\nand the manner in which it is given, have been stated. (Chap. XVIII.)\r\nWithout the above restriction, the sum might be fixed so high as to\r\nprevent persons accused of crime from procuring the necessary sureties;\r\nwhereby innocent persons might be subjected to long imprisonment before\r\nthe time of trial. It is therefore properly left to the court to fix the\r\nsum, which should correspond to the aggravation of the offense. Courts\r\nhave the same discretion as to the measure of punishment to be inflicted\r\nin each particular case of crime.\r\n\r\n§9. The ninth amendment is, \"The enumeration in the constitution of\r\ncertain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others\r\nretained by the people.\" There were persons who feared that, because the\r\nconstitution mentioned certain rights as belonging to the people, those\r\nnot mentioned might be considered as having been surrendered to the\r\ngeneral government. This article was therefore inserted to prevent such\r\na misconstruction of the constitution.\r\n\r\n§10. The tenth amendment is similar to the preceding. \"The powers not\r\ndelegated to the United States by the constitution, nor prohibited by it\r\nto the states are reserved to the states respectively, or to the\r\npeople.\" In other words the powers which the constitution has not given\r\nto the general government, nor prohibited the states from exercising,\r\nthe states or the people have reserved to themselves. So clear is it,\r\nthat they retain all power which they have not in words parted with,\r\nthat it seems strange to many that the insertion of such a provision\r\nshould ever have been thought necessary.\r\n\r\n§11. The eleventh amendment was proposed at the first session of the\r\nthird congress, March 5, 1794, and its ratification by the\r\nconstitutional number of states was announced to congress by the\r\npresident in a message dated January 8, 1798. This article prohibits a\r\ncourt of the United States from trying \"any suit in law or equity\r\ncommenced or prosecuted against one of the states by citizens of another\r\nstate, or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state.\" This is\r\nintended to prevent a state from being sued in an original suit, by a\r\nprivate person, the citizen of another state.\r\n\r\n§12. The twelfth and last amendment effects a change in the mode of\r\nelecting the president and vice-president, and has been considered.\r\n(Chap. XXXIX, §4.) This amendment was proposed at the first session of\r\nthe eighth congress, December 12, 1803, and was adopted by the requisite\r\nnumber of states in 1804, according to a public notice by the secretary\r\nof state, dated the 25th of September of the same year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommon and Statutory Law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLVII.\r\n\r\nRights of Persons. Personal Security; Personal Liberty; Religious\r\nLiberty; Liberty of Speech, and of the Press; Right of Property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. Having taken a general view of the state governments and the\r\ngovernment of the United States, and seen how wisely they are adapted to\r\npromote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty; we\r\nproceed to give a digest of the laws which more particularly define the\r\nrights and prescribe the duties of citizens, or by which their social\r\nand civil intercourse is to be regulated. These laws, it will be\r\nrecollected, we have elsewhere called the _municipal_ or _civil_ laws,\r\nas distinguished from the _political_ or _fundamental_ law of the state.\r\n(Chap. III, §6.)\r\n\r\n§2. These laws are of two kinds, the written or statute law, and the\r\nunwritten or common law. _Statute laws_ are those which are enacted by\r\nthe legislature, and recorded in writing, and are usually collected and\r\npublished in books. The word _statute_ is from the Latin _statuo_, to\r\nset, fix, or establish.\r\n\r\n§3. The _common law_ is not a code of written laws enacted by a\r\nlegislature, but consists of rules of action which have become binding\r\nfrom long usage and established custom. It is said to be founded in\r\nreason and the principles of justice. The common law of England was\r\nbrought over by our ancestors, and established here before the\r\nrevolution. Some of the states, in their constitutions, adopted after\r\nthe revolution, declared it to be the law of their respective states;\r\nand it has continued to be law in all the states, and is still so\r\nconsidered, except such parts as have been altered or repealed by\r\nconstitutional or legislative enactments, or by usage.\r\n\r\n§4. The most valuable rights protected by law are the rights of personal\r\nsecurity and personal liberty. The right of _personal security_ is the\r\nright to be secure from injury to our persons or good names. By\r\n_personal liberty_ is meant the freedom of our bodies or persons from\r\nrestraint or confinement. Provisions guarantying these rights have been\r\nincorporated into our national constitution, and the constitutions of\r\nthe several states.\r\n\r\n§5. The right of personal security is also protected by the law, by\r\nwhich a man, on showing reasonable cause of danger of personal injury,\r\nmay require his adversary to be bound with sureties to keep the peace.\r\nAnd for violence committed, the offender may be prosecuted in behalf of\r\nthe state and punished, and is liable also to the party aggrieved in a\r\ncivil suit for damages.\r\n\r\n§6. This right is further protected by the law which permits a man to\r\nexercise the natural right of self-defense. In defending his person in\r\ncase of a felonious assault, he may lawfully take the life of his\r\nassailant. This is by law pronounced justifiable homicide, and is\r\nallowed also in defense of one's property against felonious and violent\r\ninjury. But homicide (man-killing) is not justifiable in case of a\r\nprivate injury, nor upon the pretense of necessity when the party is not\r\nfree from fault in bringing that necessity upon himself.\r\n\r\n§7. The right to be secure in our good names, which is included in the\r\nright of personal security, is protected by the law against slander and\r\nlibel. A _slander_ is a false and malicious report or statement tending\r\nto injure another in his reputation or business, and which, if true,\r\nwould render him unworthy of confidence or employment; or it is the\r\nmaliciously charging of another with anything by which he sustains\r\nspecial injury. The slander of a person by words spoken, is a civil\r\ninjury, that is, an injury for which redress is to be obtained in a\r\ncivil suit for damages.\r\n\r\n§8. A slander written or printed, is called _libel_. A libel is a\r\nmalicious publication in print or writing, signs or pictures, tending to\r\nexpose a person to public hatred, contempt, or ridicule. And it is\r\nconsidered in law a publication of such defamatory writing, though\r\ncommunicated to a single person. A slander written or printed is likely\r\nto have a wider circulation, to make a deeper impression, and to become\r\nmore injurious. A person may therefore be liable in damages for words in\r\nprint or writing, for which he would not be liable if merely spoken. In\r\ncase of libel, a person is not only liable to a private suit for\r\ndamages, but may be indicted and tried as for other public offenses.\r\n\r\n§9. It is a principle of English common law, that in a criminal action\r\nfor libel it is immaterial whether the matter of it is true or false;\r\nand a person prosecuted for libel is not allowed, in justification, to\r\nprove to the jury the truth of his statement, since the provocation, not\r\nthe falsity, is to be punished. And, whether true or false, the libelous\r\npublication is equally dangerous to the public peace, and is presumed to\r\nhave been made with malicious intent.\r\n\r\n§10. It is held--and perhaps it is the prevailing opinion--that in a\r\ncivil action for damages, a libel must be false as well as scandalous,\r\nand, consequently, that the truth may be pleaded in justification. This\r\npoint, however, is not fully settled. The reason for this distinction\r\nbetween cases of public and private prosecution, it is not easy to\r\nperceive. If it is just to inquire into the good or bad intentions of\r\nthe publisher in one case, it would seem to be equally so in the other.\r\n\r\n§11. But the common law has been materially modified and relaxed in this\r\ncountry. In most of the states it is provided by their constitutions or\r\nby law, that the truth may be given in evidence, and if it shall appear\r\nto the jury \"that the matter charged as libelous is true, and was\r\npublished with good motives and for justifiable ends, the party shall be\r\nacquitted.\" As it may sometimes be proper to speak or publish an\r\nunfavorable truth concerning others, the principle of the above\r\nprovision would seem to be founded in justice. In the state of Vermont,\r\nand perhaps in a few other states, if the party prosecuted proves the\r\ntruth of his statement in any case, he is acquitted.\r\n\r\n§12. The right of _personal liberty_ is secured by express provision of\r\nthe national constitution, which guaranties to every citizen \"the\r\nprivilege of the writ of _habeas corpus_.\" (Cons. U.S. art. 1, sec. 9.)\r\nThe nature of this writ has been explained. (Chap. XXXVI, §4.) The same\r\nprovision has been inserted in the state constitutions. This was a\r\ncommon law privilege, independently of any constitutional enactment. The\r\nprincipal object of the provision seems to be to take from congress and\r\nthe state legislatures the power to abolish this privilege, or even to\r\nsuspend it for any time, or in any case, except the particular cases\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n§13. Freedom of religious opinion and worship, or liberty of\r\nconscience, is a valuable personal right, included in the term, personal\r\nliberty, and is effectually secured in this country. In England, the\r\ncountry of our ancestors, there is a church established and supported by\r\nthe government. This is sometimes called \"union of church and state.\"\r\nThe American people, from their love of religious freedom, have, in\r\ntheir constitutions, expressly prohibited congress from making laws\r\n\"respecting the establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free\r\nexercise thereof.\" (Amend. art. 1.) And the state constitutions have\r\nadopted similar provisions.\r\n\r\n§14. Another important personal right comprehended in the term personal\r\nliberty, and guarantied in the same article of the national\r\nconstitution, and in the state constitutions, is the liberty of speech\r\nand of the press. Some of the monarchical governments of Europe\r\nprohibited the people from speaking against the sovereign or his\r\ngovernment. Books and papers could not be published until they had been\r\nexamined and approved. The persons authorized to examine the\r\nmanuscripts, were called _censors_. Hence the expression sometimes\r\nheard, \"censorship of the press.\" To secure the liberty of speaking and\r\npublishing their sentiments freely up on all subjects, the people of\r\nthis country have made express provision in their constitutions; which,\r\nhowever, while they properly guaranty this right, leave men \"responsible\r\nfor its abuse,\" and liable to prosecution for slander or libel. (§7, 8.)\r\n\r\n§15. The _right of property_ is the right to acquire property, and to be\r\nfree in the use and enjoyment of it. To protect men in the enjoyment of\r\nthis right, is one of the principal objects of constitutions and laws.\r\nThe rights of property will constitute the subject matter of several\r\nsubsequent chapters of this digest of \"common and statutory law.\" (Chap.\r\nL, and onward.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLVIII.\r\n\r\nDomestic Relations. Husband and Wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. To render a marriage contract lawful, the parties must be of\r\nsufficient age, called the age of consent; which, by the common law of\r\nthe land, is fourteen years in males, and twelve in females. In some\r\nstates the age of consent has been altered by statute. In Ohio, Indiana,\r\nand Michigan, it has been raised to eighteen years in males, and\r\nfourteen in females; in Illinois to seventeen and fourteen; in\r\nWisconsin, to eighteen and fifteen.\r\n\r\n§2. The parties must also have sufficient understanding to transact the\r\nordinary business of life. Idiots and lunatics cannot legally contract\r\nmarriage. Persons must also act freely. If the consent of either party\r\nhas been obtained by force or fraud, the marriage may be declared void.\r\nThe parties must not be nearly related. The degrees of relationship at\r\nwhich they are forbidden to marry are in some states fixed by law; but\r\nthe laws of these states on the subject are not uniform. Some states\r\nhave forbidden marriages which come within what is called the Levitical\r\ndegrees; but these degrees have received different interpretations.\r\nAccording to the interpretation of some, the relation of uncle and niece\r\nand aunt and nephew, come within this rule.\r\n\r\n§3. No person can lawfully remarry who has a wife or husband living.\r\nSuch second marriage is, by the common law, null and void. In some of\r\nthe states, perhaps in most of them, it is declared _polygamy_, and a\r\nstate prison offense, except in certain cases; as when the husband or\r\nwife of the party who remarries has been long absent, and the party\r\nre-marrying does not know the other to have been living within the time;\r\nor when the former husband or wife of the party remarrying has been\r\nsentenced to imprisonment for life; or when the former marriage has been\r\nlawfully annulled or dissolved. If, however, a marriage has been\r\nannulled or dissolved for the cause of adultery, the criminal party is,\r\nin some states at least, not allowed to remarry.\r\n\r\n§4. In some of the cases excepted in the preceding section, the second\r\nmarriage is merely excusable. Although the party to such marriage is\r\nexempt from the _penalty_, yet if the former wife or husband is living,\r\nthough the fact is unknown, and no divorce has been duly announced, or\r\nthe first marriage has not been duly annulled; the second marriage is\r\nvoid. Where there is no statute regulation, the common law governs,\r\nwhich is, that nothing but death, or a decree of a competent court, can\r\ndissolve the marriage tie.\r\n\r\n§5. The manner in which marriages are to be solemnized, and by whom, and\r\nthe manner in which marriage licenses are to be obtained, or notices of\r\nmarriage published, (which are required in some states,) are prescribed\r\nby the laws of the states in which such regulations exist. Marriages may\r\nusually be solemnized by ministers of the gospel, judges, justices of\r\nthe peace, and certain other officers. But by the common law, a marriage\r\nis rendered valid by a simple consent of the parties declared before\r\nwitnesses, or subsequently acknowledged; or such consent may be inferred\r\nfrom continual cohabitation and reputation as husband and wife.\r\n\r\n§6. In law, the husband and wife are regarded as one person. By the\r\ncommon law, the husband, by marriage, acquires a right to the property\r\nof the wife which she had before marriage, and which she may acquire\r\nafter marriage. To her personal property, including debts due her by\r\nbond, note, or otherwise, he has an absolute right, and may use and\r\ndispose of the same as he pleases. Her chattels real, however, which are\r\nleases of land for years, though personal property, he can not dispose\r\nof by will; and if he makes no disposition of them during his life time,\r\nand she outlives him, she takes them in her own right. If he survives\r\nhis wife, he acquires an absolute right to them.\r\n\r\n§7. But to the real estate of the wife, the husband does not acquire an\r\nabsolute right. He has only a right to the use, rents, and profits\r\nthereof during his life, if he shall die before his wife; and in that\r\nevent she takes the estate again in her own right. If the wife dies\r\nfirst, and there are no children, her heirs immediately take the estate.\r\nIf there are children living, the husband holds the estate for life, and\r\non his death it goes to the wife or her heirs.\r\n\r\n§8. But this rule of the common law which gives to the husband the\r\npossession and disposal of the property of the wife, has been repealed\r\nby special enactments in most of the states. By these state laws, the\r\nreal and personal property of the wife owned by her before marriage, or\r\nconveyed to her by any other person than her husband after marriage,\r\nwith the rents and profits of such property, is declared to be her own,\r\nand at her disposal, and not liable for the debts of her husband, except\r\nin a few cases specified in the law of each state. In some of these\r\nstates, although the property of the wife is not liable for the\r\nhusband's debts, he has the control and management, and the rents and\r\nprofits of it.\r\n\r\n§9. As the husband, by common law, acquires, by marriage, an interest in\r\nthe property of his wife, he becomes liable for her debts contracted\r\nbefore marriage; but if they are not recovered of him during coverture,\r\nhe is discharged _Coverture_, in law, is the state of a married woman,\r\nconsidered as under _cover_, or under the power of her husband. Some of\r\nthe states which have abolished the common law right of the husband to\r\nthe property of the wife acquired before marriage, have also abolished\r\nthe common law obligation of the husband to pay the debts of the wife\r\ncontracted before marriage; her property alone being liable for such\r\ndebts.\r\n\r\n§10. The husband is bound to maintain his wife, and is liable for debts\r\nwhich she may contract for necessaries, but for nothing more. If he\r\nrefuses to provide for her wants, or if, through other ill treatment or\r\nfault on his part, they become separate, he is liable to fulfill her\r\ncontracts for necessaries, even though he has forbidden persons to trust\r\nher. If they part by consent, and he secures to her a separate\r\nmaintenance, and pays it according to agreement, he is not liable, even\r\nfor necessaries.\r\n\r\n§11. The husband and wife can not be witnesses for or against each\r\nother; but any declarations made by a wife when acting as agent for her\r\nhusband, may be admitted in evidence against him. In a few states, laws\r\nhave been proposed, and, it is believed, in some they have been passed,\r\nremoving, to some extent, this restriction upon the right of a husband\r\nor wife to the testimony of the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLIX.\r\n\r\nDomestic Relations, continued. Parent and Child; Guardian and Ward;\r\nMinors; Masters, Apprentices, and Servants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. Parents, as the natural guardians of their children, are obliged to\r\nprovide for their support and education during their minority, or while\r\nthey are under twenty-one years of age. At twenty-one they attain the\r\nage of majority, when they are said to be _of age_. Under this age they\r\nare, in law, _infants_, or _minors_. The father, if he is able, is bound\r\nto support his minor children, even if they have property of their own;\r\nbut in such case the mother is not so bound. But a husband is not\r\nobliged to maintain the child of his wife by a former husband. If,\r\nhowever, he takes the child into his family, he is responsible for its\r\nmaintenance and education while it lives with him.\r\n\r\n§2. A father may be liable for necessaries sold to a child. But to be so\r\nliable, it must be proved that the contract for the articles was made by\r\nhis actual authority, or the circumstances must be sufficient to imply\r\nauthority; or that neglect to provide for the child, or some other fault\r\non the part of the father, rendered assistance to the child necessary.\r\nBeing bound to provide for his children, the father has a right to their\r\nlabor or service; and he may recover their wages from any person\r\nemploying them without his consent.\r\n\r\n§3. In general, a minor cannot bind himself by contract. If he lives\r\nwith his father or guardian, by whom he is properly supplied, he can not\r\nbind himself even for necessaries. But if, on contracting a debt, he\r\nagrees to pay it after he shall have become of age, he will then become\r\nliable. If a minor has no father or other guardian, his contracts for\r\nnecessaries are binding upon him.\r\n\r\n§4. If a minor takes an estate and agrees to pay rent, he will be liable\r\nfor its payment after he shall have become of age. If he receives rents,\r\nhe can not demand them again when of age. If he pays money on a\r\ncontract, and enjoys the benefit of the contract and then avoids it when\r\nhe comes of age, he can not recover back the consideration paid. And if\r\nhe avoids an executed contract when he comes of age, on the grounds of\r\ninfancy, he must restore the consideration.\r\n\r\n§5. Minors are answerable for crimes, and may be indicted and tried,\r\nand, on conviction, be fined and imprisoned. They are responsible also\r\nfor acts of fraud. Their age and the peculiar circumstances in which\r\nthey were placed, might be such as to exempt them from liability; but in\r\ncases of gross and palpable fraud committed by minors who have arrived\r\nat the age of discretion, they would be bound by a contract.\r\n\r\n§6. In general, male infants and unmarried females under eighteen years,\r\nmay, of their own free will, bind themselves, in writing, to serve as\r\n_apprentices_ and servants, in any trade or employment; males until the\r\nage of twenty-one, and females until the age of eighteen years, or for a\r\nshorter time. But the minor must have the consent of the father; or if\r\nthe father is dead, or disqualified by law, or neglects to provide for\r\nhis family, consent must be had of the mother; or, if the mother is dead\r\nor disqualified, then of the guardian.\r\n\r\n§7. Pauper children may be bound out by the officers having charge of\r\nthe poor. And the laws of many of the states, perhaps of most or all of\r\nthem, very properly require, that a person, to whom a poor child is\r\nbound, shall agree to cause such child to be taught to read and write,\r\nand, if a male, to be also instructed in the general rules of\r\narithmetic.\r\n\r\n§8. Masters have a right to correct their apprentices with moderation\r\nfor negligence and misbehavior; and they may recover damage at law of\r\ntheir apprentices for willful absence. On the other hand, a master may\r\nbe prosecuted for ill usage to his apprentice, and for a breach of his\r\ncovenant. A master is liable to pay for necessaries for his apprentice,\r\nand for medical attendance, but he is not so liable in the case of a\r\nhired servant.\r\n\r\n§9. When an apprentice becomes immoral and disobedient, an investigation\r\nof the matter may be had by the proper authorities; and for good cause\r\nthe indenture may be annulled, and the parties discharged from their\r\nobligations. Upon the death of a master, an apprenticeship is dissolved.\r\n\r\n§10. There is, it is believed, no statute law in any state, particularly\r\ndefining the rights and obligations of _hired servants_ and the persons\r\nemploying them. Both are obliged to fulfill their agreement. If a hired\r\nservant leaves the service of his employer, without good cause, before\r\nhe has worked out the time for which he was hired, he cannot recover his\r\nwages. And for immoral conduct, willful disobedience, or habitual\r\nneglect, he may be dismissed. On the other hand, ill usage, or any\r\nfailure on the part of the employer to fulfill his engagement, releases\r\nthe laborer from his service.\r\n\r\n§11. How far a master is answerable for the acts of his hired servant,\r\nis not clear. As a general rule, the master is bound for contracts\r\nmade, and liable for injuries done, by a servant actually engaged in the\r\nbusiness of his master, whether the injury proceeds from negligence or\r\nfrom want of skill. But for an injury done by a willful act of the\r\nservant, it is considered that the master is not liable. If the servant\r\nemploys another to do his business, the master is liable for the injury\r\ndone by the person so employed. But a servant is accountable to his\r\nmaster for a breach of trust, or for negligence in business, or for\r\ninjuring another person in his master's business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter L.\r\n\r\nRight of Property. How Title to property is acquired; Wills and\r\nTestaments Title to Property by Descent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. Every citizen of the United States is capable of holding lands, or\r\nreal estate, and of taking them by devise, descent, or purchase, and of\r\nselling and conveying away such estate. Aliens, by common law, have not\r\nthis power. In many of the states, however, this disability has been\r\nremoved by statute. On declaring their intention to become citizens, and\r\ncomplying with certain regulations, aliens acquire the right to take and\r\nhold real estate to themselves and their heirs. But they may hold and\r\ndispose of personal property without any special enactment.\r\n\r\n§2. To _devise_ property is to give or bequeath it by will. A _will_ is\r\na written instrument in which a person declares his will concerning the\r\ndisposal of his property after his death. It is also called _testament_.\r\nThis word is from the Latin _testis_, meaning witness. Hence the word\r\nhas come to be applied to this instrument, which is the witness or proof\r\nof a person's will. A person making a will is called _testator_; one who\r\ndies without making a will or testament, is called _intestate_.\r\n\r\n§3. All persons of full age and sound mind, except married women, may\r\ngive and bequeath real and personal estate by a last will and testament.\r\nIn many of the states, personal estate may be willed at an earlier age.\r\nIn a few states, females at eighteen may make a will of real and\r\npersonal estate. In a few states, personal estate may be willed\r\nverbally, if the will is within a specified time reduced to writing, and\r\nsubscribed by disinterested witnesses. In Ohio such will must be written\r\nwithin ten days after the speaking of the testamentary words. A will of\r\nthis kind is called a _nuncupative_ will.\r\n\r\n§4. In most of the states, laws have been enacted, allowing married\r\nwomen to hold, in their own exclusive right, all the property, real and\r\npersonal, which they owned at the time of marriage, and which they may\r\nacquire after marriage. (Chap. XLVIII, §8.) With the right of possession\r\nis also given, it is presumed, the power of disposing of the property by\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n§5. A will devising real estate must be subscribed by at least two, in\r\nsome slates three, attending witnesses, in whose presence the testator\r\nmust subscribe the will, or acknowledge that he subscribed it, and\r\ndeclare it to be his last will and testament. If the testator is unable\r\nto sign his will, another person may write the testator's name by his\r\ndirection; but he should sign his own name as witness to the will.\r\n\r\n§6. A testator may revoke or alter his will by a later will or writing,\r\nexecuted in the same manner. But the second will, to revoke the former,\r\nmust contain words expressly revoking it, or directing a different\r\ndisposal of the property. A will may also be revoked by a sale of the\r\nproperty. And any alteration of the estate or interest of the testator\r\nin lands devised, is held to be an implied revocation of the will. Lands\r\npurchased after a will has been made, are not conveyed by it. As a\r\ngeneral rule, a will is also revoked by the subsequent marriage of the\r\ntestator and birth of a child, unless the wife and child have been\r\notherwise provided for. The will of an unmarried woman is revoked by her\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\n§7. By the statutes of some states, a child born after the death of the\r\ntestator, or born in his lifetime and after the making of the will,\r\ninherits a share of the estate, as if the father had died intestate. In\r\nsome other states, the statute goes further, and gives the same relief\r\nto all the children who are not provided for in the will, and who have\r\nnot had their portion in the parent's lifetime.\r\n\r\n§8. A _codicil_ is an addition or a supplement to a will, and must be\r\nexecuted with the same solemnity. It is no revocation of a will, except\r\nin the precise degree in which it is inconsistent with it.\r\n\r\n§9. After the death of a testator, the will is brought before the court\r\nof probate to be proved. (Chap. XX, §5.) When a will has been duly\r\nproved and allowed, the court issues letters testamentary to the\r\nexecutor. An _executor_ is a person named in the will of a testator to\r\ncarry the will into effect. _Letters testamentary_ give him the power to\r\nact in settling the estate of the deceased. If he refuses to act, or is\r\nnot lawfully qualified, the court appoints a person, who, in that case,\r\nis called _administrator_; and the court issues _letters of\r\nadministration_ with the will annexed. Letters of administration are\r\nalso issued in case of a person dying intestate. They give to the\r\nadministrator the requisite authority to settle the estate.\r\n\r\n§10. Taking property by _descent_, is the receiving of it from an\r\nancestor or other relative dying intestate. If a person dies without\r\nmaking a will, his property falls, or _descends_ to his lawful heirs.\r\nThe order or rule of descent is not uniform in this country, being\r\ndetermined, to a great extent, by the laws of the states. In general,\r\nhowever, the real estate of an intestate descends, first to his lineal\r\ndescendants, that is, persons descending in a direct line, as from\r\nparents to children, and from children to grand-children. The lineal\r\ndescendants most nearly related to the intestate, however distant the\r\nrelation may be, takes the estate.\r\n\r\n§11. If any children of an intestate are dead, and any are living, the\r\ninheritance descends to the children living, and to the descendants of\r\nthe children dead, so that each child living shall receive such share as\r\nhe would receive if all were living, and the children of those who are\r\ndead such share as the parents would receive if living. Thus, suppose an\r\nintestate had three sons, one of whom is dead, but has left children. In\r\nthis case, each of the sons living would share one-third of the\r\nproperty, and the children of the deceased son the remaining third.\r\n\r\n§12. But if the children are all dead, and there are grand-children\r\nliving, the grand-children share equally, though not an equal number are\r\nchildren of each parent. If, for example, an intestate dies leaving no\r\nchildren, but having had two sons, one of whom had left three children,\r\nand the other two, the five share equally in the estate. The laws of\r\nRhode Island, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee,\r\nLouisiana, and Alabama, unless recently altered, are exceptions to this\r\nrule. In these states, and perhaps in a few others, though the children\r\nof the intestate are all dead, the grand-children do not share equally,\r\nbut those of each stock, or family, take the portion which their parent\r\nwould have taken if living.\r\n\r\n§13. The order of descent is so different in the states, especially when\r\nthere are no lineal descendants of an intestate, that it can be\r\nascertained only by reference to the laws of each state. As a general\r\nrule, real estate passes, (1.) to the lineal descendants; (2.) to the\r\nfather; (3.) to the mother; (4.) to the collateral or _side_ relatives,\r\nas brothers, sisters, nephews, nieces, &c. But even to this general rule\r\nthere are exceptions in the laws of some states.\r\n\r\n§14. The rule of descent given in the preceding sections, it will be\r\nseen, relates to _real_, and not to personal estate. The rule in regard\r\nto real estate, and that relating to personal estate, are generally\r\nsomewhat different in the same state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LI.\r\n\r\nDeeds and Mortgages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. In whatever manner a person acquires possession of real estate,\r\nwhether by devise, descent, purchase, or gift, evidence of possession\r\nconsists, usually, in a _deed_, which is a written instrument conveying\r\nreal estate to an heir, a purchaser, or a donee. A deed of land sold,\r\ncontains the names of the seller and the purchaser, the consideration,\r\nor sum paid for it, and a description of it; and in express words grants\r\nand conveys all the interest of the seller or grantor to the purchaser\r\nand his heirs forever: and the seller affixes his name and seal to the\r\ninstrument, usually in the presence of one or more subscribing\r\nwitnesses.\r\n\r\n§2. But a deed thus executed does not give to the purchaser sure\r\npossession of the land, until it has been duly recorded in the office of\r\nthe proper recording officer of the county in which the land lies; or in\r\nthe office of the town clerk, in those states in which conveyances are\r\nrequired to be there recorded. If the land should be conveyed by the\r\nseller to a subsequent purchaser who should get his deed first on\r\nrecord, such purchaser would hold the land, unless, before purchasing,\r\nhe had had notice of a sale and deed to a prior purchaser.\r\n\r\n§3. In some states, a reasonable time is allowed a purchaser to get his\r\ndeed recorded before he loses his right of possession by the earlier\r\nrecording of another's deed. In some other states, the time is fixed by\r\nlaw, and varies in these different states from fifteen days to two\r\nyears. But a deed, though not recorded in season to secure the title\r\nagainst a second purchaser, or though not recorded at all, is good\r\nagainst the sellor or grantor; and the dispossessed purchaser has a\r\nlawful claim against him for the value of the land.\r\n\r\n§4. A recorder or register may not record a conveyance of land without\r\nproof that it was executed by the person named in it as the maker or\r\ngrantor. This proof consists, usually, in a certificate of a proper\r\nofficer, on the back or margin of the deed, stating that the person so\r\nnamed appeared before him, and, being duly sworn, acknowledged that he\r\nwas the person who had executed the deed. In every state, judges of\r\ncourts and justices of the peace, mayors of cities and aldermen,\r\nnotaries public, or some of these officers, and commissioners of deeds\r\nappointed for that special purpose may take acknowledgments. In New York\r\nand a few other states, the acknowledgment may be dispensed with, and\r\nthe execution of the deed may be proved by the subscribing witnesses.\r\nDeeds duly acknowledged, are, with the acknowledgments, copied by the\r\nrecorder, word for word, in books provided for that purpose.\r\n\r\n§5. As a person can not give a good title unless he has one himself, the\r\nseller or grantor covenants and agrees that he is seized of the premises\r\nin _fee-simple_, (meaning that he is the absolute owner,) and that he\r\nwill _warrant and defend_ the premises in the quiet and peaceable\r\npossession of the purchaser and his heirs forever. Hence such deed is\r\ncalled a _warranty deed_, [For definition of _fee_ and _fee-simple_, see\r\nChap. LIII, §1.] A _quit-claim_ deed merely conveys the interest or\r\nclaim of the grantor. It contains no warranty of title against any other\r\nclaimant.\r\n\r\n§6. A _mortgage_ is a grant of land as security for the payment of\r\nmoney, on condition that, if the money shall be paid according to\r\ncontract, the grant shall be void. When only a part of the purchase\r\nmoney is paid on receiving a deed, the purchaser usually executes a\r\nmortgage to the seller, pledging the land as security for the remainder\r\nof the purchase money. And if the money shall not be paid as agreed, the\r\nland may be sold; but if sold for more than the amount due, the overplus\r\nis to be paid to the mortgager.\r\n\r\n§7 To effect a full conveyance of real estate, a wife must join with\r\nher husband by signing the deed with him; or, in case of the husband's\r\ndeath in her lifetime, she would be entitled, for life, to the use of\r\none-third of the estate. This interest of a widow in the estate of a\r\ndeceased husband, is called _dower_. It is necessary also for the wife\r\nto acknowledge, before the officer taking the acknowledgment, and apart\r\nfrom her husband, that she signed the deed freely, and without\r\ncompulsion of her husband. In some states, the acknowledgment of the\r\nwife out of the presence of her husband is not required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LII.\r\n\r\nIncorporeal Hereditaments. Right of Way; Aquatic Rights, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. The term _incorporeal hereditaments_ may, to some readers, need\r\nexplanation. A _hereditament_ is a thing capable of being inherited.\r\nLand, and all things attached to it by the course of nature or the hands\r\nof men, as trees, herbage, water, buildings, &c., which are comprehended\r\nin the term real estate, are _corporeal_ hereditaments. _Incorporeal_\r\nhereditaments are inheritable rights which grow out of corporeal\r\ninheritances, or which consist in their enjoyment; as the right of\r\npasturing a common; a right of passage over the land of another; a right\r\nto the use of waters, sometimes called _aquatic rights_, &c.\r\n\r\n§2. A _right of way_ is a right of private passage over another man's\r\nground. This right is sometimes granted by the owner of the soil; and to\r\nmake it a freehold right, it must be created by deed, though it be only\r\nan easement upon the land of another, and not an interest in the land\r\nitself. An _easement_ is, in general, an accommodation. In law, it is\r\nany privilege or convenience which one has of another, by grant or\r\notherwise, as a right of way, &c. By the grant of an easement, the\r\ngrantee acquires no other right than what is necessary to the fair\r\nenjoyment of the privilege.\r\n\r\n§3. If it is a mere personal right, it can be enjoyed only by the owner\r\nof the right, and when he dies, the right dies with him. But a right of\r\nway belonging to an estate may be conveyed when the land is sold. Thus,\r\nif a man owns lot A and lot B, and he used a way from lot A, over lot B,\r\nto a mill, or to a river; and if he sells lot A with all ways and\r\neasements, the grantee will have the same privilege of passing over lot\r\nB as the grantor had.\r\n\r\n§4. A right of way may arise from necessity. If a man sells a part of\r\nhis land, and there is no other way to the remaining part, he is\r\nentitled to a right of way to it over the land sold. And if a man sells\r\nland wholly surrounded by his own land, the purchaser is entitled to a\r\nright of way to it over the other's ground, even though no such right is\r\nreserved. The right of way passes to the purchaser, as necessarily\r\nincident to the grant, or included in it.\r\n\r\n§5. A man having license to conduct lead pipes through the land of\r\nanother, may enter on the land, and dig therein, to mend the pipes. The\r\ngeneral rule is, that when the use of a thing is granted, every thing is\r\ngranted which is necessary to the enjoyment of its use.\r\n\r\n§6. A person has a temporary right of way over land adjoining a public\r\nhighway, if the highway is out of repair, or is obstructed by snow, a\r\nflood, or otherwise. But the right of going upon adjoining lands does\r\nnot apply to private ways. A person having a right to a private way over\r\nanother's land, has no right to go upon adjoining land, even though the\r\nprivate way is impassable.\r\n\r\n§7. A right of way sometimes arises by _prescription_; which is the\r\nright or title to a thing derived from long use and enjoyment. Such is\r\nthe right which, by common law, a man acquires to land which has been\r\npeaceably held by himself, or by himself and preceding owners, for\r\ntwenty years. Although the first occupancy was obtained without grant,\r\nthe long free use of the land is, in law, equivalent to a grant, and\r\nimplies a valid title. In some states, shorter periods have been fixed\r\nby statute in which a right by prescription may be obtained. In\r\nPennsylvania, and Ohio, the period is fixed at twenty-one years.\r\n\r\n§8. The owners of land adjoining highways, have a right to the soil to\r\nthe centre of the road: the public have only a right of passage while\r\nthe road is continued. The owners of the soil may maintain a suit\r\nagainst any person who encroaches upon the road, or digs up the soil, or\r\ncuts down trees growing on the side of the road. They may carry water in\r\npipes under it, and have every use of it that does not interfere with\r\nthe rights of the public.\r\n\r\n§9. Every proprietor of lands adjoining a stream, has naturally an equal\r\nright to the use of the water that flows in the stream adjacent to his\r\nlands, \"as it was wont to run.\" Each may use the water while it runs\r\nupon his own land; but he can not unreasonably detain it, or give it\r\nanother direction; and he must return it to its ordinary channel when it\r\nleaves his estate. He can not, by dams or any obstruction, cause the\r\nwater injuriously to overflow the grounds of the neighbor above him, nor\r\nso use or apply it as materially to injure his neighbor below him.\r\n\r\n§10. But this right to the use of waters, as an easement to the land,\r\nmay be acquired and lost, or enlarged and abridged, by prescription. A\r\nman may diminish the quantity of the water, or corrupt its quality, by\r\nthe exercise of certain trades; and by such use of the water for a\r\nsufficient length of time, he is in law _presumed_ to have acquired it\r\nby grant: and this presumption is the foundation of his right by\r\nprescription. The time of such use and enjoyment of water necessary to\r\nestablish such right is twenty years, except in states in which a\r\ndifferent period is fixed by statute. (§7.)\r\n\r\n§11. It is a general and established doctrine, that an exclusive and\r\nuninterrupted enjoyment of water, or of light, or of any other easement,\r\nin any particular way, for twenty years, or for any other period which\r\nin any particular state is the established period of limitation, is a\r\nsufficient enjoyment to raise a presumption of title as against the\r\nright of any other person. The enjoyment is deemed to have been\r\nuninterrupted, whether it has been continued from ancestor to heir, and\r\nfrom seller to buyer; or whether the use has been enjoyed during the\r\nentire period by one person.\r\n\r\n§12. As a right may be acquired by use, so it may be lost by disuse; and\r\nas an enjoyment for twenty years, or such other period as is prescribed\r\nby statute, is necessary to establish a right; an absolute\r\ndiscontinuance of the use for such period will raise the presumption\r\nthat the right has been released or extinguished. Thus a title to land\r\nmay pass from its actual owner by non-occupancy for the period above\r\nstated; and a title to it may be acquired by an undisturbed occupant who\r\nshall hold it in peaceable and uninterrupted possession for the same\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LIII.\r\n\r\nLeases:--Estates for Life; Estates for Years; Estates at Will; Estates\r\nby Sufferance; Rent, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. Real estate, the title to which is conveyed by deed, as\r\ndistinguished from other estates in land, is called an _estate of\r\ninheritance_. An estate of inheritance, that is, an estate in lands that\r\nmay be transmitted by the owner to his heirs, is a _fee_. No estate is\r\ndeemed a fee unless it may continue forever. When it is a pure and\r\nabsolute inheritance, clear of any qualification or condition, it is\r\ncalled a _fee-simple_.\r\n\r\n§2. An interest in lands which is to continue for a limited period, is\r\nusually conveyed by a written instrument called lease. _To lease_, means\r\nto let; but generally to grant the temporary possession of real estate\r\nto another for rent or reward. Sometimes the word _demise_ is used for\r\nease. The landlord, or person letting the estate, is called _lessor_;\r\nand the tenant, or person to whom the land is leased, is called\r\n_lessee_. Leases for a term longer than one year, are usually required\r\nto be sealed, and in some states, proved and recorded also, as deeds and\r\nmortgages.\r\n\r\n§3. These limited interests in land are divided into estates for life,\r\nestates for years, estates at will, and estates by sufferance. An\r\n_estate for life_ is an estate conveyed to a person for the term of his\r\nnatural life. Life estates held by lease, however, are not common in\r\nthis country. Another kind of life estate is that which is acquired, not\r\nby the acts of the parties, as by lease, but by the operation of law.\r\nSuch is the right of a husband to the real estate of his wife acquired\r\nby her before or after marriage. Such also is the right of dower. (Chap.\r\nXLVIII, §6, 7. Chap. LI, §7.)\r\n\r\n§4. An _estate for years_ is a right to the possession and profits of\r\nland for a determinate period, for compensation, called rent; and it is\r\ndeemed an estate for years, though the number of years should exceed the\r\nordinary limit of human life. And if a lease should be for a less time\r\nthan a year, the lessee would be ranked among tenants for years. Letting\r\nland upon shares for a single crop is not considered a lease; and\r\npossession remains in the owner.\r\n\r\n§5. A lessee for years may assign over his whole interest to another,\r\nunless restrained by agreement not to assign without leave of the\r\nlessor. And he may underlet for any less number of years than he himself\r\nholds; but he is himself liable to the landlord.\r\n\r\n§6. A tenant for years, whose lease expires after the land is sown or\r\nplanted, and before harvest, is not entitled to the crop, if the lease\r\nis for a certain period; for, knowing that his lease would expire before\r\nharvest time, he might have avoided the loss of his labor. But if the\r\nlease for years depends upon an uncertain event, the occurring of which\r\nwould terminate the lease before the expiration of the term, the tenant\r\nwould be entitled to the crop, if there were time to reap what has been\r\nsown, in case he should live. It is believed that, in a few states, the\r\ntenant has a right to the crop from grain sown in the autumn before the\r\nexpiration of the lease, and cut the next summer after its expiration.\r\n\r\n§7. Where there is an express agreement to pay rent, the tenant can not\r\navoid payment even if the premises are destroyed by fire or flood, or if\r\nhe is in any other manner deprived of their enjoyment and use, even\r\nwithout any default on his part. Hence, if land should be leased with a\r\nflock of sheep, and the sheep should die, the full rent must be paid.\r\nBut if the land should be recovered from the tenant by a person having a\r\nbetter title than that derived from his landlord, he is not liable for\r\nrent after his use of the land has ceased.\r\n\r\n§8. A tenant can not make repairs at the expense of the landlord, or\r\ndeduct the cost of them out of the rent, unless by special agreement.\r\nBut if the premises, from want of repair, have become unsafe or useless,\r\nthe tenant from year to year may quit without notice; and he would not\r\nbe liable for rent after the use had ceased to be beneficial.\r\n\r\n§9. When rent is due, payment may be made or tendered upon the premises;\r\nand if no place of payment has been agreed on, a personal tender off the\r\nland is also good. As to the time of payment, where there is no special\r\nagreement to the contrary, rent is due yearly, half-yearly, or\r\nquarterly, according to the usage of the country. Where there is no\r\nparticular usage, the rent is due at the end of the year.\r\n\r\n§10. An _estate at will_ is where land is let to another, to hold at the\r\nwill of the lessor. Tenancies at will, strictly such, are not common.\r\nSuch estates, when no certain term is agreed on, are construed to be\r\ntenancies from year to year, and each party is bound to give reasonable\r\nnotice of an intention to terminate the lease. If the tenant holds over\r\nafter the expiration of a lease for years, either by express consent, or\r\nunder circumstances implying consent, it is held to be evidence of a new\r\ncontract without any definite period, and is construed to be a tenancy\r\nfrom year to year: and in those states where the old English rule\r\nprevails, six months' notice must be given the tenant to quit.\r\n\r\n§11. What turns leases for uncertain terms into leases from year to\r\nyear, is the landlord's reserving annual rent. A tenant placed on land\r\nwithout any terms prescribed or rent reserved, is strictly a tenant at\r\nwill; and it has been held that such tenant is not entitled to notice to\r\nquit; but the general rule now seems to be, that even in such case the\r\nsix months' notice is necessary; or, as in some states, a reasonable\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\n§12. An _estate at sufferance_ is that which is acquired by a tenant who\r\nhas come into lawful possession of land, but who holds over by wrong\r\nafter his interest has ceased. He is not entitled to notice to quit; and\r\nwhere there is no special statute, he is not liable for rent; and the\r\nlandlord may enter, and remove the tenant and his goods with such gentle\r\nforce as may be necessary. If undue force is used, the landlord would be\r\nliable to an action for forcible entry and detainer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LIV.\r\n\r\nContracts in General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. A _contract_ is an agreement between two or more persons, by which\r\nthe parties agree to do, or not to do, a particular thing. Contracts are\r\n_executory_, when the stipulations remain to be executed, or when one\r\nparty agrees to sell and deliver, at a future time, for a stipulated\r\nprice, and the other agrees to accept and pay. Contracts are _express_,\r\nwhen the parties contract in express words, or by writing; _implied_,\r\nwhen an act has been done which shows that the parties must have\r\nintended to contract; as, when a person employs another to do some\r\nservice, it is presumed that the party employing intended to pay for the\r\nlabor performed.\r\n\r\n§2. Contracts are also distinguished as specialties and simple\r\ncontracts. A _specialty_ is a contract under seal; as a deed, or a bond.\r\nBut we shall here consider chiefly that common class of contracts called\r\n_simple contracts_, or _contracts by parol_. _Parol_ signifies by word\r\nof mouth. Applied to contracts, however, it not only means verbal\r\ncontracts, but includes written contracts not under seal. Both are\r\nsimple contracts; the distinction between them is in the mode of proof.\r\nThe mutual understanding of the parties to a verbal contract may be\r\nproved by parol evidence. But as the real intention of parties is more\r\nlikely to be expressed in a written contract, the rule of law is, that\r\nparol evidence may not be admitted to contradict or vary the terms of a\r\nwritten instrument. It may however be admitted to explain what is\r\ndoubtful, or to supply some deficiency.\r\n\r\n§3. To make a valid contract, _the parties must be capable of\r\ncontracting_. They must be of sound mind. Hence idiots and lunatics are\r\ngenerally incompetent to make contracts. Contracts by lunatics and\r\nidiots are not necessarily void, but only _voidable_; the validity or\r\ninvalidity depending upon facts to be proved. To avoid a contract on the\r\nground of mental imbecility, it must be proved that the party\r\ncontracting was at the time incompetent. But if a general derangement is\r\nonce established or conceded, the person is presumed to be incompetent;\r\nand the party seeking to enforce the contract must prove the other to\r\nhave been sane. The general rule in the case of idiots is, that if the\r\nparty is incapable of acting in the ordinary affairs of life, or in the\r\nparticular contract, his idiocy will annul the contract.\r\n\r\n§4. Drunkards also are incompetent to contract while in a state of\r\nintoxication, provided the drunkenness is such as to deprive them of\r\nreason for a time, and create impotence of mind. But for absolute\r\nnecessaries, if the drunkard consumes them during his drunkenness, or\r\nkeeps them after becoming sober, he is liable. Intoxication only renders\r\na contract voidable, not void, as the party intoxicated may adopt it on\r\nrecovering his understanding.\r\n\r\n§5. Another requisition to a valid contract, is the _mutual assent of\r\nthe parties_. A mere offer by one party not assented to or accepted by\r\nthe other, constitutes no contract. Assent must also be given freely. A\r\ncontract entered into under duress, or compulsion, is not binding; as\r\nwhere assent is extorted by threats of personal injury. Assent must also\r\nbe given with a knowledge of facts. A contract made under an injurious\r\nmistake, or ignorance of a material fact, may be avoided, even though\r\nthe fact is not fraudulently concealed. But a mistake made through\r\nignorance of the law, will not render a contract void.\r\n\r\n§6. A _valuable consideration_ also is necessary to a valid contract. A\r\n_consideration_ is what is given or done, or to be given or done, as the\r\ncause or reason for which a person enters into an agreement. Thus, the\r\nmoney given or offered, for which a man agrees to perform certain labor,\r\nis the consideration of the agreement. So the money or other thing for\r\nwhich a promissory note is given, is the consideration. A valuable\r\nconsideration is any thing that is either a benefit to the party\r\npromising, or some trouble or injury to the party to whom the promise is\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n§7. Mutual promises are sufficient considerations to make a contract\r\nbinding; but they must be made at the same time. Such promises support\r\neach other. The promise of one party constitutes a sufficient\r\nconsideration for a promise by the other party. In case the parties are\r\ndistant from each other, if the proposition is made in writing and sent\r\nby mail, and a letter of acceptance is written and put in the mail, the\r\ncontract is complete, unless, before mailing the letter of acceptance,\r\na second letter has been received containing a retraction of the\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\n§8. Promises which are wholly gratuitous are void; because, being\r\nneither a benefit to the promiser, nor an injury to the promisee, they\r\nare not regarded in law as a valuable consideration. Hence,\r\nsubscriptions to public works and charitable, literary, and religious\r\ninstitutions, if they are merely gratuitous, can not be collected,\r\nunless they have operated to induce others to advance money, make\r\nengagements, or do other acts to their own injury.\r\n\r\n§9. As gratuitous promises are void for want of consideration, so merely\r\ngratuitous services, as voluntarily assisting to save property from\r\nfire, or securing beasts found straying, or paying another's debts\r\nwithout request, afford no consideration upon which payment for their\r\nvalue can be lawfully claimed; there being no promise of compensation.\r\nBut if a person knowingly permits another to do certain work, as plowing\r\nhis field, or hoeing his corn, although the work may have been commenced\r\nwithout his order or request, his consent will be regarded in law as an\r\n_implied promise_ to pay for the value of the labor, unless the\r\ncircumstances of the case are such as to forbid the presumption.\r\n\r\n§10. A consideration must also be _possible_, and in accordance with\r\nlaw, sound policy, and good morals. A contract founded upon an\r\nimpossible consideration is void. No man can be lawfully bound to do\r\nwhat is not in the power of man to do. But it is otherwise, if the thing\r\nto be done is only at the time impossible in fact, but not impossible in\r\nits nature. Hence, inability from sickness to fulfill an agreement, or\r\nthe impossibility of procuring an article of a certain kind or quality\r\nwhich a person has agreed to deliver, would not exempt him from\r\nliability in damages for the non-performance of his contract.\r\n\r\n§11. A contract, the consideration of which is _illegal_ or _immoral_,\r\nmay be avoided by either party. A man can not be held to an agreement to\r\ndo acts forbidden by the law of God or by the laws of the state. But if\r\nan illegal contract has been executed; in other words, if the wrong has\r\nbeen done, the party in the wrong can not renounce the contract; for the\r\ngeneral rule is, that no man can take advantage of his own wrong; and\r\nthe innocent party alone has the privilege of avoiding the contract. If\r\nboth parties are guilty, neither can, in ordinary cases, obtain relief\r\non a contract that has been executed.\r\n\r\n§12. The rule that a consideration is necessary to a valid contract\r\napplies to all contracts and engagements not under seal, except bills of\r\nexchange and negotiable notes after they have passed into the hands of\r\nan innocent indorsee. (See Promissory Notes.) In contracts under seal, a\r\nconsideration is necessarily _implied_ in the solemnity of the\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\n§13. It is declared by the English statute of frauds, which prevails\r\ngenerally in the United States, that an agreement which is not to be\r\nperformed within one year from the time of making it, shall not be\r\nvalid, unless such agreement, or some memorandum or note thereof, is in\r\nwriting, and signed by the party to be charged. The statutes of some of\r\nthe states have adopted this provision of the English statute, and\r\nrequire further, that a special promise to answer for the debt, default,\r\nor misdoing of another person, and an agreement or promise upon\r\nconsideration of marriage, (except mutual promises to marry,) shall\r\nlikewise be void without such writing, in which the consideration shall\r\nbe expressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LV.\r\n\r\nContracts of Sale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. A Sale is a transfer of the title to property to another person for\r\na certain price; or the exchange of a commodity for its equivalent value\r\nin money. The exchange of one commodity for another, is _barter_.\r\nUnless the absolute title is conveyed, the contract is merely a\r\nmortgage. The same general principles of law which apply to contracts in\r\ngeneral, are applicable to contracts of sale, viz.: the competency of\r\nthe parties to contract; the sufficiency of the consideration; its\r\nlegality and morality; the assent of the parties; and the absence of\r\nfraud.\r\n\r\n§2. To make a sale valid, the thing to be sold must have an _actual or a\r\npossible existence_, and be _capable of delivery_. Thus, if A sells a\r\nhorse or certain goods to B; and if, at the time of the sale, the horse\r\nis dead, or the good? are destroyed; the sale is void. If the goods are\r\npartially destroyed, the buyer may either take them at a proportionate\r\nreduction of the price, or abandon the contract.\r\n\r\n§3. But, although the thing to be sold has no actual and present\r\nexistence; yet if its future existence is possible, and if it is the\r\nproduct or increase of something to which the seller has a present\r\nright, it is the subject of sale. Thus, a man may sell the wool that may\r\ngrow on his sheep, the fruit that may grow on his trees, or the future\r\nincrease of his cattle. But he cannot sell the products of the sheep or\r\ncattle which he may hereafter buy. A man may, however, agree to procure\r\ngoods which he has not, and to furnish at a future time, for a certain\r\nprice; and his contract will be good; though this is not strictly a\r\nsale, but an agreement to sell.\r\n\r\n§4. There can be no sale without a _price_; and the price must be fixed\r\nand definite, or susceptible of being ascertained by reference to some\r\ncriterion prescribed in the contract, so as to render any further\r\nnegotiation of the parties unnecessary. Thus, a man may agree to pay\r\nwhat shall be the market price at a particular time, or a price to be\r\nfixed by a third person. The price must also be payable in money or its\r\nnegotiable representative, as notes or bills. One article given for\r\nanother is merely _barter_. The same principles of law, however, govern\r\nin both cases.\r\n\r\n§5. There must be a _mutual consent of the parties_, and the contract is\r\nbinding when a proposition made by one party is accepted by the other.\r\nThe negotiation may be carried on by letter, as before stated. (Chap.\r\nLIV, §7.)\r\n\r\n§6. In contracts of sale which are not perfected at once by payment and\r\ndelivery, certain formalities are to be observed. These forms generally\r\nare prescribed by what is called the English statute of frauds, which\r\nrequires, (1.) that the buyer shall accept and receive part of the goods\r\nsold; or (2.) give something in earnest to bind the bargain, or in part\r\npayment; or (3.) that some note or memorandum in writing of the bargain\r\nshall be made and signed by the party to be charged, or by his\r\nauthorized agent. These provisions, however, apply only to cases in\r\nwhich the price of the goods sold is ten pounds sterling, or more. The\r\nsame rule prevails generally in this country, with slight variations in\r\nsome states. The price of the goods sold, in cases to which the\r\nprovisions of that statute apply, is fixed by law in many of the states,\r\nand varies from $30 to $200.\r\n\r\n§7. To complete a contract of sale, and pass the title to the property\r\nto the buyer, there must be a _delivery of the goods sold_. When the\r\ngoods are such as cannot be manually or immediately delivered, or are\r\nnot in the actual custody of the seller, the law does not require an\r\nactual delivery. But they must be placed in the power of the purchaser;\r\nor there must be such acts and declarations of the parties as imply a\r\nchange of ownership. When the right of property has been transferred to\r\nthe buyer, whether by an actual or only a constructive delivery, he\r\nimmediately assumes the risk of the goods; so that if they shall be\r\nafterward injured or destroyed, he must bear the loss.\r\n\r\n§8. When nothing is said at the sale as to the time of delivery, or the\r\ntime of payment, the buyer is entitled to the goods on payment or tender\r\nof the price, and not other wise; for, though he acquires the _right of\r\nproperty_ by the contract of sale, he does not acquire the _right of\r\npossession_, until he pays or tenders the price. But if the seller\r\ndelivers the goods absolutely, and without fraudulent contrivance on\r\nthe part of the buyer, the buyer will hold possession of them.\r\n\r\n§9. But when goods are sold on credit, and nothing is said as to the\r\ntime of delivery, the buyer is immediately entitled to the possession.\r\nIf, however, it is ascertained, before the buyer obtains possession of\r\nthe goods, that he is insolvent, or so embarrassed as to disable him\r\nfrom meeting the demands of his creditors, the seller may stop the goods\r\nas a security for the price. But if they are stopped without good cause,\r\nor through misinformation, the buyer is entitled to the goods, and to\r\ndamages which he may have sustained in consequence of their stoppage.\r\n\r\n§10. In the sale of a chattel, if the seller has possession of the\r\narticle, and sells it as his own, he is understood to _warrant the\r\ntitle_. A fair price implies a warranty of title; and the purchaser may\r\nhave satisfaction from the seller, if he sells goods as his own, and the\r\ntitle proves deficient. But if the possession is at the time in another,\r\nand there is no covenant or warranty of title, the party buys at his\r\nperil. It is thought, however, if the seller affirms that the property\r\nis his own, he warrants the title, though it is not in his possession.\r\n\r\n§11. With regard to the _quality_ of the thing, the seller is not bound\r\nto make good any deficiency, except under special circumstances, unless\r\nbe expressly warranted the goods to be sound and good, or unless he made\r\na fraudulent representation or concealment concerning them. The rule is,\r\nif there is no express warranty by the seller, nor fraud on his part,\r\nand if the article is equally open to the inspection of both parties,\r\nthe buyer who examines the article for himself, must abide by all losses\r\narising from latent defects equally unknown to both parties.\r\n\r\n§12. But this rule does not reasonably apply to cases in which the\r\npurchaser has ordered goods of a certain character, or in which goods of\r\na certain described quality are offered for sale, and, when delivered,\r\nthey do not answer the description. There being no opportunity of\r\nexamining them, there is an _implied_ warranty of the quality. An\r\nintentional concealment or suppression of a material fact, when both\r\nparties have not equal access to means of information, is unfair\r\ndealing, and renders the contract void.\r\n\r\n§13. As a general rule, each party is bound to communicate to the other\r\nhis knowledge of material facts, provided he knows the other to be\r\nignorant of them, and they are not open and naked, or equally within the\r\nreach of his observation. Surely the _moral law_ and fair dealing\r\nrequire, in all cases, a full disclosure of all defects within the\r\nknowledge of the contracting parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LVI.\r\n\r\nFraudulent Sales; Assignments; Gifts, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. The title to property is sometimes transferred with fraudulent\r\nintent. A debtor, to place his property beyond the reach of his\r\ncreditors, sells or assigns it to others by way of mortgage, under the\r\nfalse pretense of securing the payment of a debt; the property to remain\r\nin the possession and use of the assignor.\r\n\r\n§2. Any agreement which operates as a fraud upon third persons, is void.\r\nIt is a rule of common law, that all deeds of gift, and all transfers of\r\ngoods and chattels made by any person to secure them for his future use,\r\nshall be void as against creditors; and that if property assigned or\r\nsold remains with the seller or assignor, the transaction is to be\r\npresumed fraudulent. But whether such conveyance of goods is only _prima\r\nfacie_ (at first view) evidence of fraud, which the vendee or assignee\r\nmay rebut by proving the sale or assignment to have been made honestly\r\nand in good faith; or whether the transaction is fraudulent in point of\r\n_law_, and void, is a question upon which the decisions of the courts\r\nin England as well as those in this country differ, and which,\r\ntherefore, may be considered as not conclusively settled.\r\n\r\n§3. Some have made a distinction between bills of sale and assignments\r\nthat are absolute and those that are conditional. The supreme court of\r\nthe United States has affirmed the doctrine that an absolute and\r\n_unconditional_ bill of sale or conveyance, when the property is\r\nretained in possession, is of itself conclusive evidence of fraud; in\r\nother words, it is presumed to be fraud in point of law, whatever it may\r\nbe in fact. It has been held by the same court, that a conveyance with a\r\n_condition_ that the property is to remain with the vendor until the\r\ncondition shall be performed, or a conveyance in the nature of a\r\nmortgage or security, expressing an agreement between the parties, that\r\nthe mortgager shall retain possession, is valid.\r\n\r\n§4. In some states, the doctrine established by the courts is, that a\r\ncontinuance of possession is only _prima facie_ evidence of fraud; in\r\nwhich case the mortgagee or assignee is allowed to show by proof, that\r\nthe conveyance was made in good faith and for a valuable consideration.\r\nIn other states, the strict rule prevails, that, without a change of\r\npossession, the transaction is fraudulent _in law_; in which case the\r\nassignee, or person claiming the property under the assignment, is not\r\npermitted to show that, in point of _fact_, the transaction was _bona\r\nfide_, (in good faith.)\r\n\r\n§5. The rule that holds every conveyance to be fraudulent unless the\r\nproperty immediately changes hands, often operates to inconvenience and\r\neven injury of honest debtors. A debtor may be obliged to part with\r\nproperty, however convenient or needful its present use may be to him,\r\nwhen, but for this stringent rule of law, he might borrow the money to\r\npay a debt, or procure a postponement of payment, and retain the use of\r\nthe property pledged.\r\n\r\n§6. In many of the states, this perplexing question has been settled by\r\nstatute. In the state of New-York, the law expressly declares, that a\r\nsale or an assignment without immediate delivery and a change of\r\npossession, shall be presumed to be fraudulent and void as against\r\ncreditors, unless the party claiming the property under the assignment\r\nshall make it appear that the same was made in good faith, and without\r\nany attempt to defraud. Laws more or less similar to this, and securing\r\nto the assignor the use of the mortgaged property, are believed to exist\r\nin a majority of the states. The instruments conveying the property are\r\nusually called _chattel mortgages_, and are required to be recorded as\r\ndeeds; in New-York, and perhaps a few other states, only filed in the\r\ntown or county clerk's office.\r\n\r\n§7. In the sale of personal property, though there should be a judgment\r\nagainst the vendor, and the purchaser should have notice of it, that\r\nfact would not of itself render the sale fraudulent. But if the\r\npurchaser, knowing of the judgment, purchases with the view or purpose\r\nto defeat the creditor's execution, the transaction is fraudulent. The\r\nquestion of fraud depends upon the motive.\r\n\r\n§8. Assignments are sometimes made by debtors for the benefit of their\r\ncreditors. A person deeply indebted, or in embarrassed circumstances,\r\nassigns his property, in trust, to one or more persons, who are to\r\ndispose of it, and to apply the avails to the payment of his creditors,\r\nor a part of them; for the law does not forbid a debtor's giving a\r\npreference to one or more creditors over others, provided the assignment\r\nis for a sufficient consideration. A debtor may directly assign or\r\ntransfer all his property to a single creditor, and the assignment be\r\nvalid; but if the value of the property is manifestly excessive, and\r\ndisproportionate to the debt which it is intended to cover, the other\r\ncreditors have a right to the surplus.\r\n\r\n§9. When an embarrassed debtor agrees to pay his creditors a certain\r\nproportion of their claims in consideration of a discharge of their\r\ndemands, if he privately agrees to give a better or further security to\r\none than to others, the contract is void; because the condition upon\r\nwhich they agree to discharge the debtor is, that they shall share\r\nequally.\r\n\r\n§10. A gift, or conveyance founded merely upon a consideration of\r\naffection, or blood, or consanguinity, may be set aside by creditors, if\r\nthe grantor was in embarrassed circumstances when he made it; for a man\r\nis bound, both legally and morally, to pay his debts before giving away\r\nhis property. But if he is indebted to only a small amount in proportion\r\nto the value of his property, and wholly unembarrassed, the gift is not\r\nrendered voidable by his indebtedness, even though he should afterwards\r\nbecome insolvent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LVII.\r\n\r\nBailment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. The word _bailment_ is from _bail_, French, to deliver. (Chap.\r\nXVIII, §14.) Bailment, in law, is a delivery of goods, in trust, upon\r\nagreement that the trust shall be executed, and the goods restored by\r\nthe bailee, when the purpose of the bailment shall have been, answered.\r\n\r\n§2. A person who receives goods to be kept and returned without reward,\r\nmust keep them with reasonable care, or, if they receive injury, he will\r\nbe liable for the damage: in other words, he is responsible only for\r\ngross neglect. Gross neglect is a want of that care which every man of\r\ncommon sense takes of his own property. A _depositary_, who is a person\r\nwith whom goods are deposited, has no right to use the goods intrusted\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n§3. A _mandatary_, or one who undertakes to do an act for another\r\nwithout recompense, in respect to the thing bailed to him, is\r\nresponsible for gross neglect, if he undertakes and does the work amiss;\r\nbut it is thought that for agreeing to do, and not undertaking or doing\r\nat all, he is not liable for damage.\r\n\r\n§4. The borrower of an article, as a horse, carriage, or book, without\r\nreward, is liable for damage in case of slight neglect. But if the\r\narticle is applied only to the use for which it is borrowed, is used\r\ncarefully by the borrower only, and returned within the time for which\r\nit was borrowed, he is not liable.\r\n\r\n§5. Property taken in pledge as security for a debt or an engagement,\r\nmust be kept with ordinary care; in other words, the pawnee is\r\nanswerable only for ordinary neglect; and if the goods should then be\r\nlost or destroyed, the pawner is still liable for the debt. If the\r\npawnee derives any profit from the use of the property, he must apply\r\nthe profits, after deducting necessary expenses, toward the debt.\r\n\r\n§6. Another kind of bailment is the hiring of property for a reward. If\r\nan article is injured or destroyed without any fault on the part of the\r\nhirer, the loss falls on the owner, for the risk is with him.\r\n\r\n§7. If work or care is to be bestowed for a recompense on the thing\r\ndelivered, the workman is liable for ordinary neglect; and the work must\r\nbe performed with proper skill, or he is answerable for damage. If a\r\ntailor receives cloth to be made into a coat, he is bound to do it in a\r\nworkmanlike manner.\r\n\r\n§8. Innkeepers are in general responsible for all injuries to the goods\r\nand baggage of their guests, even for thefts. But for loss caused by\r\nunavoidable accident, or by superior force, as robbery, they are not\r\nliable.\r\n\r\n§9. A person who carries goods for hire in a particular case, and not as\r\na common carrier, is answerable only for ordinary neglect, unless he\r\nexpressly takes the risk of a common carrier.\r\n\r\n§10. A common carrier is one who carries goods for hire as a common\r\nbusiness, whether by land or by water, and is responsible to the owner\r\nof the goods, even if robbed of them. He is in the nature of an insurer,\r\nand is answerable for all losses, except in cases of the act of God, as\r\nby lightning, storms, floods, &c. and public enemies, as in time of war.\r\n\r\n§11. A common carrier is bound to receive from any person paying or\r\ntendering the freight charges, such goods as he is accustomed to carry,\r\nand as are offered for the place to which he carries. But he may refuse\r\nto receive them if he is full, or if they are dangerous to be carried,\r\nor for other good reasons. He may refuse to take them unless the charges\r\nare paid; but if he agrees to take payment at the end of the route, he\r\nmay retain them there until the freight is paid. A carrier must deliver\r\nfreight in a reasonable time; but he is not liable for loss by the\r\nfreezing of a river or canal during his voyage, if he has used due\r\ndiligence.\r\n\r\n§12. Proprietors of a stage coach do not warrant the safety of\r\npassengers as common carriers; and they are not responsible for mere\r\naccidents to the persons of the passengers, but only for the want of due\r\ncare. Slight fault, unskillfulness, or negligence, either as to the\r\nsufficiency of the carriage, or to the driving of it, may render the\r\nowner responsible in damages for injury to passengers. But as public\r\ncarriers, they are answerable for the loss of a box or parcel of goods,\r\nthough ignorant of its contents, unless the owner fraudulently conceals\r\nthe value or nature of the article, or deludes the carrier by treating\r\nit as of little or no value. Public carriers are responsible for the\r\nbaggage of their passengers, though they advertise it as being at the\r\nrisk of the owners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LVIII.\r\n\r\nPrincipal and Agent, or Factor; Broker; Lien, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. An _agent_, or factor, is a person intrusted with the management of\r\nthe business of another, who is called _principal_. The words _agent_\r\nand _factor_ both signify a deputy, a substitute, or a person acting\r\nfor another; but _agent_ seems to be the more comprehensive term, being\r\napplied to one who is intrusted by another with any kind of business;\r\n_factor_ more properly denotes an agent employed by merchants residing\r\nin other places to buy and sell, and transact certain other business on\r\ntheir account. A factor, from his being commissioned or authorized to\r\nact for his principal, and especially if allowed a commission, or a\r\ncertain rate per cent, of the value of the goods bought or sold, is\r\ncalled a _commission merchant_.\r\n\r\n§2. If a factor advances money on property intrusted to him, he can hold\r\nit until the money shall be refunded, and all charges paid. If the\r\nactual owner of the property is unknown to the factor, the person in\r\nwhose name the goods were shipped, is to be deemed the owner.\r\n\r\n§3. The right of a factor to hold property against the owner in\r\nsatisfaction of a demand, is called _lien_; and the factor may sell the\r\ngoods to satisfy his claim; but he must pay the surplus, if any, to the\r\nprincipal or owner. A factor can not pledge goods intrusted to him for\r\nsale, as security for his own debts. If he disposes of merchandise\r\nintrusted or consigned to him, and applies the avails to his own use,\r\nwith intent to defraud the owner, he may be punished by fine and\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\n§4. How far, in ordinary business, a principal is bound by the acts of\r\nan agent, it is not easy to determine. As a general rule the acts of a\r\ngeneral agent; that is, one who either transacts all kinds of business\r\nfor his employer, or who does all acts connected with a particular\r\nbusiness or transaction, or which relate to some particular department\r\nof business, bind his principal, so long as he keeps within the general\r\nscope of his authority, though he may in some special cases act contrary\r\nto his private instructions. But an agent employed for a particular\r\npurpose, if he goes beyond the limits of his power, does not bind his\r\nprincipal.\r\n\r\n§5. An agent is bound, in ordinary cases, to observe the instructions of\r\nhis principal, even though an act contrary to such instructions should\r\nbe intended for the benefit of the principal. The agent must bear,\r\npersonally, all losses growing out of a non-compliance with his orders;\r\nand the profit accruing therefrom goes to the benefit of the principal.\r\nAn agent, however, is excused from a strict compliance with his orders,\r\nif, after receiving them, some sudden and unforeseen emergency has\r\narisen, in consequence of which such compliance would operate as an\r\ninjury to the principal, and frustrate his intention.\r\n\r\n§6. When an agent receives no instructions, he must conform to the usage\r\nof trade, or to the custom applicable to the particular agency; and any\r\ndeviation therefrom, unless justified by the necessity of the case,\r\nrenders him solely liable for any loss or injury resulting from it.\r\n\r\n§7. An agent is bound to exercise ordinary diligence and reasonable\r\nskill; and he is responsible only for the want thereof. Ordinary\r\ndiligence is that which persons of common prudence use in conducting\r\ntheir own affairs. Reasonable skill is that usually possessed by persons\r\nof common capacity employed in the same business.\r\n\r\n§8. If an agent exceed the limits of his authority, he becomes\r\npersonally responsible to the person with whom he deals, if the\r\nlimitations of his authority are unknown to such person. He is in like\r\nmariner responsible, if he makes a contract in his own name; or if he\r\ndoes not disclose the name of the principal, so as to enable the party\r\nwith whom he deals to have recourse to the principal in case the agent\r\nhad authority to bind him. And if the agent even buys in his own name,\r\nbut for the principal, and without disclosing his name, the principal\r\nalso is bound, provided the goods come to his use. Also if the principal\r\nis under age, or a lunatic, or otherwise incompetent to contract, the\r\nagent is liable.\r\n\r\n§9. A _broker_ is an agent employed to negotiate sales between parties\r\nfor a compensation in the form of a commission, which is commonly called\r\n_brokerage_. His business consists chiefly in negotiating exchanges; or\r\nin buying and selling stocks, goods, ships, or cargoes; or in procuring\r\ninsurances and settling losses; and as he confines himself to one or the\r\nother of these branches, he is called an exchange broker, stock broker,\r\ninsurance broker, &c. A broker differs from a factor. He has not the\r\ncustody of the goods of his principal. He is merely empowered to effect\r\nthe contract of sale; and when this is done, his agency ends. If a\r\nbroker executes his duties in such a manner that no benefit results from\r\nthem, or is guilty of gross misconduct in selling goods, he is not\r\nentitled to a commission or compensation.\r\n\r\n§10. A _lien_, as the claim of a factor upon goods intrusted to him for\r\nsale, has been noticed. (§3.) The right of lien extends to others than\r\nfactors. It is intended also for the benefit of manufacturers,\r\nmechanics, and other persons carrying on business for the accommodation\r\nof the public. A tailor has a lien upon the garment made from another's\r\ncloth until he is paid for the making; a shoemaker upon the shoes made\r\nfrom another's leather; a blacksmith upon the horse he has shod; an\r\ninnkeeper upon the horse or goods of his guest; and common carriers upon\r\nthe goods they transport. But they cannot hold the property for any\r\nother debt; nor can they sell it to satisfy their claim. Whenever a\r\nperson allows property to go out of his possession, he loses his lien.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LIX.\r\n\r\nPartnership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. A partnership is an association formed by contract between two or\r\nmore persons, for joining their money, labor, or skill, in lawful\r\nbusiness, the profits to be divided and the loss to be borne by the\r\npartners in certain proportions. It is a partnership if one furnishes\r\nthe funds and the other performs the labor; or if, when no money is\r\nnecessary, each agrees to do his share of the labor. A partnership or\r\nassociation of this kind is denominated a _firm_, or _house_.\r\n\r\n§2. The act of any one of the firm is considered the act of all, and\r\nbinds all; and either of them is liable for all the debts. But if a bill\r\nor note is drawn by one partner in his own name only, without appearing\r\nto be on partnership account, he alone is bound, though it were made for\r\na partnership purpose. A partner buying goods on his own account for his\r\nindividual use, is alone liable; but if they afterward go to the use of\r\nthe partnership, all become responsible.\r\n\r\n§3. Sometimes a person agrees to receive, by way of rent, a portion of\r\nthe profits of a farm, a tavern, or a manufactory; or an agent or a\r\nclerk receives a share of the profits for his labor. But as there is in\r\nthese cases no partnership, the persons who buy the stock and hire the\r\nlabor are alone responsible.\r\n\r\n§4. All the partners must unite in suing and being sued. One who should\r\nconceal his name so as not to be known when the debt is contracted, may\r\nbe sued when discovered to be a partner, if he shares in the profits of\r\nthe trade.\r\n\r\n§5. A partner cannot sell his interest to another person, who is to take\r\nhis place in the partnership, without the consent of all the partners:\r\nnor can a partner, without such consent, withdraw when he pleases, and\r\ndissolve the partnership, except in cases in which the partnership is\r\nwithout any definite term. A partnership is dissolved by the death,\r\ninsanity, bankruptcy, or other inability of one of the parties.\r\n\r\n§6. When a partnership is dissolved by the withdrawal of any of the\r\npartners, notice of dissolution ought to be duly published, or a firm\r\nmay be bound by a contract made by one partner in the usual course of\r\nbusiness and in the name of the firm, with a person who contracted on\r\nthe faith of the partnership, and who had no notice of the dissolution.\r\nThe same notice is necessary to protect a retiring partner from\r\ncontinued responsibility. And even if due notice is given, yet, if he\r\nwillingly suffers his name to continue in the firm, or in the title of\r\nthe firm over the door of the shop or store, he may in certain cases be\r\nliable.\r\n\r\n§7. In some of the states, a partnership may be formed by a number of\r\npersons, some of whom are to be responsible only to a limited amount;\r\nand their names are not to be used in the firm. Before a partnership of\r\nthis kind can do business, a writing and certificate signed by the\r\nparties stating the terms of partnership, and the amount for which the\r\n_special partners_ (as they are called) are to be responsible must be\r\nrecorded. The terms of partnership must also be published in a\r\nnewspaper.\r\n\r\n§8. In these _limited_ partnerships, as they are termed, the special\r\npartners are liable only to the amount stated in the terms of\r\npartnership. The other partners, called _general partners_, whose names\r\nonly are used, and who transact the business, are liable for all the\r\ndebts contracted, as in ordinary partnerships. If such partnership is to\r\nbe dissolved by act of the parties before the expiration of the term for\r\nwhich it is formed, notice of dissolution must be filed and recorded,\r\nand published in a newspaper. Such is the law in the state of New York;\r\nand it is presumed to agree, in its most essential provisions, with the\r\nlaws of the other states in which these partnerships are authorized.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LX.\r\n\r\nPromissory Notes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. A promissory _note_ is a written promise to pay a specified sum at a\r\ncertain time, to a person named, or to his order, or to the bearer. A\r\ncommon form of a note is the following:\r\n\r\n     $100. Albany, June 9, 1859.\r\n\r\n     Three months after date, I promise to pay to James Smith, or\r\n     bearer, one hundred dollars, value received.\r\n\r\n     John Brown.\r\n\r\n§2. A note thus payable to Smith or bearer, or to him or his order, is\r\ncalled _negotiable_, because it may be sold or transferred to any other\r\nperson, who has the same power to sue for and collect the money, as\r\nSmith, the original promisee. If it were made payable to Smith _or\r\norder_, he must indorse it by writing his name on the back of it, before\r\nit would pass as a negotiable note. The indorsement is considered as the\r\norder of Smith to the maker to pay it to any other person. But, though\r\nnot negotiable, it might be transferred; but the holder must sue in the\r\nname of Smith, and Brown might offset any demands which he has against\r\nSmith.\r\n\r\n§3. An indorsement, made by writing the name only on the back of a note,\r\nis called a _blank_ indorsement. A full indorsement is one which points\r\nout the person to whom the note is to be paid. A blank indorsement may\r\nbe filled up at any time by the holder. For example: A note is payable\r\nto \"John Jay or order,\" or to \"the order of John Jay,\" who indorses it\r\nin blank which makes it payable to any other holder. Now if any holder\r\nor indorsee wishes it paid to any particular person, he fills up the\r\nblank by writing a request to that effect above the name of the\r\nindorser, thus: \"Pay to George Bruce,\" or \"Pay to George Bruce or\r\norder;\" who, again, may by indorsement order it paid to some particular\r\nperson. Or, if he should indorse it in blank, or order it paid \"to the\r\n_bearer_,\" it would again pass, as at first, by mere delivery.\r\n\r\n§4. In common business transactions in the country, notes intended to be\r\nnegotiable are usually made payable to bearer, as in the form given.\r\n(§1.) The young reader, or other person inexperienced in business, may\r\nnot know why they are not always so written. The making of a note\r\npayable to order protects the holder or owner in case the note should be\r\nlost. Take, for example, the note supposed in the preceding section,\r\nindorsed in blank. Suppose the owner resides in Buffalo, and the maker\r\nin Detroit. The owner writes over the name of John Jay, \"Pay to George\r\nBruce,\" also residing in Detroit, to whom it is sent by mail, to be by\r\nhim presented to the maker for payment. And should the note by accident\r\nor fraud fall into the hands of another, it being payable to Bruce only,\r\nor to his order, the parties are protected from loss.\r\n\r\n§5. As a contract is not binding without a valuable consideration,\r\n(Chap. LIV, §6,) the words \"value received\" are inserted in notes, as\r\nevidence of such consideration. But where there is no statute requiring\r\nthe insertion of these words, a note is good without them. Whether they\r\nare inserted or not, the note is presumed to have been given for a\r\nvaluable consideration; and the maker, to avoid his obligation to pay\r\nit, must make it appear that no value was received.\r\n\r\n§6. A note made by two or more persons may be joint or joint or several.\r\nWhen it is written, \"We promise to pay,\" it is only a joint note, and\r\nall must be sued together. If written, \"We jointly and severally promise\r\nto pay,\" they may be sued either jointly or separately. Also if written\r\n\"I promise to pay,\" it is treated as a joint and several note. A note\r\nwritten, \"We promise,\" and signed, A. B., principal, and C. D.,\r\nsecurity, is the joint note of both; and if written, \"I promise,\" and\r\nsigned in the same manner, it is the joint and several note of both.\r\n\r\n§7. Any person having in possession a negotiable note, though a mere\r\nagent, is deemed the true owner, and may sue it in his own name, without\r\nshowing title. The _bona fide_ holder can recover upon the paper, though\r\nit came to him from a person who had stolen or robbed it from the true\r\nowner; provided he took it innocently in the course of trade for a\r\nvaluable consideration before it was due, and with due caution. But if\r\nsuspicion is cast upon the title of the holder, by showing that the\r\ninstrument has got into circulation by force or fraud, then the holder\r\nmust show the consideration he gave for it.\r\n\r\n§8. Ordinarily, a person can not convey to another a valid title to\r\nproperty which is not lawfully his own; and hence the purchaser of\r\nstolen goods must give them up to the lawful owner. The exception to\r\nthis rule, in the case of promissory notes, seems to be founded in\r\nreason and good policy. The use of negotiable paper in commercial\r\ntransactions is of great public convenience; and it is proper that, for\r\nthe sake of trade, protection should be given to the holder of such\r\npaper who receives it fairly in the way of business, though it has been\r\npaid, if he received it before it fell due.\r\n\r\n§9. But it is equally material for the interests of trade, that the\r\nowner should have due protection. Hence if a person takes a note from a\r\nstranger without inquiring how he came by it; or does not take it in the\r\nusual course of business, or for some responsibility incurred on the\r\ncredit of the note, he takes it at his peril. But the owner, in order to\r\nplace his right to relief beyond question, ought to use diligence in\r\napprising the public of the loss of the note.\r\n\r\n§10. A person buying a note after it has become due, takes it at his\r\nperil. Although the holder may sue it in his own name, the maker may\r\noffset any demands which he had against the promisee before it was\r\ntransferred, as in the case of notes not negotiable. (§2.) But when\r\nnotes in which no day of payment is expressed comes under this rule, is\r\na question to be determined by circumstances. In New Jersey and\r\nPennsylvania, the words \"without defalcation or discount,\" or words to\r\nthat effect, must be inserted in notes, or they may be met by offsets as\r\nnotes that are bought after due.\r\n\r\n§11. A note made payable in some commodity is not negotiable. If it is\r\nnot paid according to the conditions therein expressed, the maker\r\nbecomes liable to pay in cash. But in either case, if it passes to a\r\nthird person, he can sue it only in the name of the promisee or payee;\r\nand it may be met by offsets as other notes not negotiable, (§2,) and\r\nnotes bought after due. (§10.)\r\n\r\n§12. Notes payable _on demand_, or in which no time of payment is\r\nmentioned, are due immediately, and no demand of payment is necessary.\r\nBut a note payable _at sight_, or at a specified time after sight, must\r\nbe presented for payment before it can be sued. If the words \"with\r\ninterest\" are omitted, interest commences at the time the note becomes\r\ndue. If payable on demand, it will draw interest from the time when\r\npayment is demanded.\r\n\r\n§13. After the day on which a note is made payable, the maker has three\r\ndays in which to make payment, which are called _days of grace_. Hence,\r\na note payable on the first day of the month is not due and suable until\r\nthe fourth. If, however, the last day of grace falls on Sunday, or the\r\nfourth of July, or any other day recognized by law as a holiday, or day\r\nof public rest, the last day of grace would be a day earlier. If the\r\nfourth of July or any other holiday should come on Saturday, the note\r\nwould be due on Friday. Or if such day should fall on Monday, the last\r\nday of grace would be Saturday.\r\n\r\n§14. To hold the indorser of a note responsible, payment must be\r\ndemanded of the maker on the last day of grace. As to the time of day\r\nwhen the demand should be made, it is considered that the maker is\r\nentitled to the latest convenient time within the customary business\r\nhours of the place where the note is presented.\r\n\r\n§15. If payment has been demanded and refused, notice thereof must be\r\ngiven to the indorser; and one entire day is allowed the holder to give\r\nthe notice. If the demand is made on Saturday, it is sufficient to give\r\nnotice on Monday. If the indorser resides in the same town, he may be\r\nnotified personally by the holder, or by a messenger sent to his\r\ndwelling-house, where notice may be given personally, or left in a way\r\nlikely to bring it to his knowledge. If the parties reside in different\r\ntowns, notice may be sent by mail; in which case, the notice must be\r\nput into the post-office, as early as the next day after the last day of\r\ngrace, so as to be forwarded as soon as possible thereafter: or notice\r\nmay be sent by a private conveyance or a special messenger.\r\n\r\n§16. If, in consequence of the removal of the maker before the note\r\nbecomes due, or from any other cause, his residence is unknown, the\r\nholder must make endeavors to find it, and make the demand there;\r\nthough, if he has removed out of the state, it is sufficient to present\r\nthe note at his former place of residence. If the maker has absconded,\r\nthat will, as a general rule, excuse the demand.\r\n\r\n§17. Notes, on being transferred, are guarantied by indorsement. If a\r\nperson simply writes his name on the back, he is liable as indorser\r\nonly. If he guarantees \"the payment of the note,\" he is generally\r\nconsidered liable as an original promisor. If he guaranties the note\r\n\"good,\" or \"collectable,\" the maker, and the indorsers also, if any,\r\nmust be sued, before the guarantor is liable. Strict notice to a\r\nguarantor is not required to bind him, as in the case of an indorser.\r\nBut to hold him liable in case immediate notice is not given, or the\r\nnote is not immediately sued, it must be shown that he has not suffered\r\ninjury from want of notice, or that the note was not collectable of the\r\nmaker or indorsers when due. But the kind of liability incurred, whether\r\nthat of indorser, original promisor, or surety, by indorsing a note or\r\nguarantying payment, is not the same in all the states. There are sundry\r\nother points in the law relating to promissory notes, on which the\r\nstatutes and judicial decisions are not uniform in all the states.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LXI.\r\n\r\nBills of Exchange; Interest; Usury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. A bill _of exchange_ is a written order or request to a person in a\r\ndistant place, to pay a third person a certain sum of money. The\r\nfollowing is a common form:\r\n\r\n     $1,000. New-York, August 10, 1859.\r\n\r\n     Twenty days after date, (or at sight, or ten days after sight,) pay\r\n     to the order of John Stiles, one thousand dollars, value received,\r\n     and charge the same to account of\r\n\r\n     To George Scott, Thomas Jones.\r\n\r\n     New Orleans, La.\r\n\r\n§2. Bills drawn on persons in foreign countries, are called _foreign_\r\nbills of exchange; those drawn on persons in distant places in our own\r\ncountry, are called _inland_ bills of exchange. To persons in mercantile\r\nbusiness they are of great convenience, as will be seen from the\r\nfollowing example of their nature and operation.\r\n\r\n§3. A, in New-York, has $1,000 due him from B, in New Orleans. A draws\r\nan order on B for that sum, and C, who is going to New Orleans, pays A\r\nthe money, takes the order, and receives his money again of B. Thus A is\r\naccommodated by receiving his debt against B, and O has avoided the risk\r\nof carrying the money from place to place. A, who draws the order, or\r\nbill, is called the _drawer_. B, to whom it is addressed, is the\r\n_drawee_; C, to whom it is made payable, is the _payee_. As the bill is\r\npayable to C, or his order, he may, by indorsment, direct the bill to be\r\npaid to D; in which case C becomes the _indorser_, and D, to whom the\r\nbill is indorsed, is called the _indorsee_ or _holder_.\r\n\r\n§4. If, when a bill is presented to the drawee, he agrees to pay it, he\r\nis said to _accept_ the bill, and writes his acceptance upon it. An\r\nacceptance may, however, be by parol. The acceptor of a bill is the\r\nprincipal debtor; the drawer, the surety. The acceptor is bound, though\r\nhe accepted without consideration, and for the sole accommodation of\r\nthe drawer. But payment must be demanded on the last day of grace; and,\r\nif refused, notice of non-payment must be given to the drawer, as in the\r\ncase of an indorsed promissory note. (Chap. LX, §15.)\r\n\r\n§5. No precise time is fixed by law at which bills payable at sight or a\r\ncertain number of days after sight, must be presented to the drawee for\r\nacceptance; though an unreasonable delay might discharge the drawer. A\r\nbill payable on a certain day after date, need not be presented before\r\nthe day of payment, but if presented before due, and acceptance is\r\nrefused, it is dishonored; and notice must be given immediately to the\r\ndrawer. If a bill has been accepted, payment must be demanded of the\r\nacceptor, when the bill falls due; and if no place is appointed for\r\npayment, the demand must be made at his house or residence, or upon him\r\npersonally.\r\n\r\n§6. A check upon a bank, (Chap. XXIV, §3,) is another kind of negotiable\r\npaper. It partakes more of the nature of a bill of exchange than of a\r\npromissory note. It is not a direct promise to pay; but it is an\r\nundertaking, by the drawer, that the drawee shall accept and pay; and\r\nthe drawer is answerable only when the drawee fails to pay. A check\r\npayable to bearer passes by delivery; and the bearer may sue on it as on\r\nan inland bill of exchange.\r\n\r\n§7. When a foreign bill of exchange is to be presented for acceptance or\r\npayment, demand is usually made by a _notary public_; and in case of\r\nrefusal, his certificate of the presentment of the bill and of the\r\nrefusal, is legal proof of the fact in any court. This certificate is\r\ncalled _protest_, which means, _for proof_. A protest may be noted on\r\nthe day of the demand; though it may be drawn up in form at a future\r\nperiod. Notaries are appointed in all towns and cities of commercial\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n§8. A protest of an inland bill of exchange is not generally deemed\r\nnecessary in this country; though it is the practice to have bills,\r\ndrawn in one state on persons in another, protested by a notary. No\r\nprotest is legal evidence in court, except in the case of a foreign\r\nbill. Yet it is expedient, in many cases of inland bills, to employ\r\nnotaries when evidence is to be preserved, because they are easily found\r\nwhen wanted as witnesses. In some states, bills drawn in one state and\r\npayable in another, are deemed foreign bills; and their protest as such\r\nis required. Notes payable at banks are also protested for non-payment.\r\n\r\n§9. _Interest_ is a premium paid for the use of money, or a profit per\r\ncent, received for money lent, or on an unpaid demand. Thus a person\r\nlends $1,000 to another person, who pays for the use of it six per cent,\r\na year, or $6 for every hundred, as interest. The rate of interest is\r\nfixed by a law of the state.\r\n\r\n§10. The established lawful rates of interest in the several states are\r\nas follows: _Six_ per cent, in all but the following: In New-York,\r\nMichigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, _seven_ per cent.; in Alabama and Texas\r\n_eight_ per cent.; in Louisiana, _five_ per cent.; bank interest _six_;\r\nin California, _ten_ per cent. But there may be taken by special\r\nagreement, in Florida and Louisiana, _eight_ per cent.; in Mississippi,\r\nArkansas, Ohio, Missouri, Iowa, _ten_; in Texas and Wisconsin, _twelve_;\r\nin Minnesota and California, any rate. In Illinois and Michigan, for\r\nmoney loaned, it may be _ten_. In Mississippi, for the _bona fide_ use\r\nof money _eight_ per cent.\r\n\r\n§11. A rate of interest beyond that which is established by law, is\r\n_usury_. Not only can no more be collected on any contract or obligation\r\nthan the legal rate, but in most of the states there is some forfeiture\r\nfor taking usurious interest. In a few, the obligation is void, and the\r\npayment of no part of the debt can be enforced by law; in others, twice\r\nor thrice the excess above the lawful interest is forfeited; and in\r\nsome, only the excess paid can be recovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LXII.\r\n\r\nCrimes and Misdemeanors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. The statutes of each state define the crimes of which its laws take\r\ncognizance. The definitions given in this chapter, agree substantially,\r\nit is presumed, with those of similar crimes in every state in the\r\nunion. The statutes also prescribe the penalties, which are not\r\nprecisely the same in all the states. Nor is there in any state an equal\r\nmeasure of punishment inflicted in all cases for the same offense. The\r\nlaws usually declare the longest and the shortest terms of imprisonment,\r\nand the highest and lowest fines, leaving the exact measure of\r\npunishment, except for crimes punishable by death, to the discretion of\r\nthe judges, to be fixed according to the aggravation of the offense.\r\n\r\n§2. The laws of the several states differ in respect to the number of\r\ncrimes made punishable by death. In some states the penalty of death is\r\nannexed to the crime of murder only. Treason is punishable by death; but\r\nas this offense is defined and made punishable by the laws of the United\r\nStates, not all the states take cognizance of it. If committed in such\r\nstates, it is tried in the courts of the United States. In New York,\r\nmurder, treason, and arson in the first degree, are punishable by death.\r\nFew states make more than these crimes thus punishable. In two or three\r\nstates, the penalty of death has been abolished, and imprisonment for\r\nlife substituted.\r\n\r\n§3. Crimes punishable by death, are called _capital_ crimes, and their\r\npunishment is called _capital_ punishment. The word capital is from the\r\nLatin _caput_, which means head; and so has come to signify the highest\r\nor principal. Hence, probably, the application of the word capital to\r\nthe principal crimes receiving the highest punishment, which was\r\nformerly practiced extensively in other countries by beheading or\r\n_decapitating_ the criminals.\r\n\r\n§4. _Treason_ is defined by statute to be, levying war in any state\r\nagainst the people of the state; or a combination of two or more\r\npersons, attempting by force to usurp or overturn the government of the\r\nstate; or in adhering to enemies of the state while separately engaged\r\nin war with a foreign enemy, and giving them aid and comfort.\r\n\r\n§5. _Murder_ is the killing of a person deliberately and maliciously,\r\nand with intent to effect death; or killing a person in committing some\r\nother crime, though not with a design to effect death; or in killing a\r\nperson purposely and without previous deliberation. The less aggravated\r\ncases of murder, are in some states distinguished as murder in the\r\nsecond degree, and punished by imprisonment for a long term, or for\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n§6. _Manslaughter_ is killing a person either upon a sudden quarrel, or\r\nunintentionally while committing some unlawful act. The statutes of New\r\nYork define four different degrees of manslaughter.\r\n\r\n§7. _Arson_ is maliciously burning any dwelling-house, shop, barn, or\r\nany other building, the property of another. Arson in the first degree,\r\nwhich is burning an inhabited dwelling _in the night time_, is in some\r\nstates punishable with death.\r\n\r\n§8. _Homicide_ signifies mankilling. It is of three kinds: felonious,\r\njustifiable, and excusable. When felonious, it is either murder or\r\nmanslaughter. _Justifiable_ homicide is that which is committed in the\r\nnecessary defense of one's person, house, or goods, or of the person of\r\nanother when in danger of injury; or that which is committed in lawfully\r\nattempting to take a person for felony committed, or to suppress a riot,\r\nor to keep the peace. _Excusable_ homicide is the killing of a person by\r\naccident, or while lawfully employed, without any design to do wrong. In\r\nthe two last cases there is no punishment.\r\n\r\n§9. Intentionally _maiming_ another by cutting out or disabling the\r\ntongue or any other member or limb; inveigling or _kidnapping_;\r\n_decoying_ and taking away children; _exposing children_ in the street\r\nto abandon them; committing or attempting an assault with _intent to\r\nkill_, or to commit any other felony, or in resisting the execution of a\r\nlegal process; _administering poison_ without producing death;\r\n_poisoning any well_ or spring of water; are all felonies, and\r\npunishable as such.\r\n\r\n§10. _Burglary_ is maliciously and forcibly breaking into and entering\r\nin the night time, any dwelling-house or other building, with intent to\r\ncommit a crime. Breaking into and entering a house by day, is considered\r\na minor degree of burglary.\r\n\r\n§11. _Forgery_ consists in falsely making, counterfeiting, or altering\r\nany instrument of writing, with intent to defraud. The word\r\n_counterfeiting_ is generally applied to making false coin or bank\r\nnotes, or in passing them; or in having in possession any engraved\r\nplate, or bills unsigned, which are intended to be used for these\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n§12. _Robbery_ is the taking of personal property from another in his\r\npresence and against his will, by violence, or by putting him in fear of\r\nimmediate injury to his person. Knowingly to send or deliver, or to make\r\nfor the purpose of being sent, a letter or writing, threatening to\r\naccuse any one of crime, or to do him some injury, with intent to extort\r\nor gain from him any money or property, is considered an _attempt to\r\nrob_, for which the offender may be imprisoned.\r\n\r\n§13. _Embezzlement_ is fraudulently putting to one's own use what is\r\nintrusted to him by another. To buy or receive property knowing it to\r\nhave been embezzled, is to be guilty of the same offense. Embezzling is\r\nusually punishable in the same manner as larceny of the same amount.\r\n\r\n§14. _Larceny_ is theft or stealing. The stealing of property above a\r\ncertain amount in value is called _grand larceny_, and is a state prison\r\noffense. If the value of the property stolen is of less amount, the\r\noffense is called _petit larceny_, and is punished by fine or\r\nimprisonment in jail or both.\r\n\r\n§15. _Perjury_ is willfully swearing or affirming falsely to any\r\nmaterial matter, upon an oath legally administered. _Subornation of\r\nperjury_ is procuring another to swear falsely; punishable as perjury.\r\n\r\n§16. _Bribery_ is promising or giving a reward to a public officer, to\r\ninfluence his opinion, vote or judgment. A person _accepting_ such\r\nbribe, is punishable in the same manner, and forfeits his office, and,\r\nin some states, may never hold another public trust. This offense is not\r\nin all the states punishable by imprisonment in the state prison.\r\n\r\n§17. _Dueling_ is a combat between two persons with deadly weapons.\r\nKilling another in a duel is murder, and punishable with death. If death\r\ndoes not ensue, imprisonment. Challenging, or accepting a challenge to\r\nfight, or to be present as a second, imprisonment. Dueling is not a\r\npunishable offense in every state.\r\n\r\n§18. Aiding or attempting to aid a prisoner committed for felony, to\r\n_escape from confinement_, or forcibly rescuing a prisoner charged with\r\ncrime, from the custody of a public officer, is a crime. If the offense\r\nfor which the prisoner is committed is less than felony, the punishment\r\nis imprisonment in jail, or fine, or both.\r\n\r\n§19. _Bigamy_ is the crime of having two or more wives, and is also\r\ncalled _polygamy_. But bigamy literally signifies having _two_ wives,\r\nand polygamy any number more than one. These words, in law, are applied\r\nalso to women having two or more husbands. A person having a lawful\r\nhusband or wife living, and marrying another person, is guilty of\r\nbigamy. An unmarried person, also, who shall marry the husband or wife\r\nof another, is punishable in like manner.\r\n\r\n§20. _Incest_ is the marrying or cohabiting together as husband and\r\nwife, of persons related to each other within certain degrees.\r\n\r\n§21. _Opening a grave_ and removing a dead body for any unlawful\r\npurpose, or purchasing such body knowing it to have been unlawfully\r\ndisinterred, is a crime. This offense is in some states punishable by\r\nimprisonment in a county jail, or by fine, and not in a state prison.\r\n\r\n§22. Persons sometimes advise or are knowing to the commission of\r\nfelonies, but are not actually engaged in committing them. Such are\r\n_accessories_. He who advises or commands another to commit a felony, is\r\ncalled an _accessory before the fact_, and is punished in the same\r\nmanner as the principal. If he conceals the offender after the offense\r\nhas been committed, or gives him any aid to prevent his being brought to\r\npunishment, he is an _accessory after the fact_, and may be imprisoned\r\nor fined.\r\n\r\n§23. _Assault and Battery_ is unlawfully to assault or threaten, or to\r\nstrike or wound another. Besides being liable to fine and imprisonment,\r\nthe offender is liable also to the party injured for damages.\r\n\r\n§24. A _riot_ is the assembling together of three or more persons, with\r\nintent forcibly to injure the person or property of another, or to break\r\nthe peace; or agreeing with each other to do such unlawful act, and\r\nmaking any movement or preparation therefor, though lawfully assembled.\r\nWhen riotous persons are thus assembled, and are proceeding to commit\r\noffenses, any judge, justice, sheriff, or other ministerial officer, may\r\nin the name of the state, command them to disperse. If they refuse, the\r\npeace officers are required to call upon all persons near to aid in\r\ntaking the rioters into custody. Persons refusing to assist may be\r\nfined.\r\n\r\n§25. A sheriff or other officer voluntarily suffering a prisoner charged\r\nwith or convicted of an offense, to _escape_, from his custody, is\r\nguilty of a misdemeanor. To _rescue_ a prisoner thus charged or\r\nconvicted, is punishable in a similar manner. It is also a misdemeanor\r\nto assist a criminal, with a view to effect his escape, though he does\r\nnot escape from jail.\r\n\r\n§26. A person taking upon himself to act as a public officer, and taking\r\nor keeping a person in custody unlawfully or without authority, is\r\n_false imprisonment_; for which the offender may be fined or imprisoned.\r\n\r\n§27. The offenses mentioned in the last four sections, being of a lower\r\ngrade than those defined in the preceding sections, and not being\r\npunishable in a state prison, are usually called _misdemeanors_, and are\r\npunishable by fine or imprisonment in a county jail. There are numerous\r\nother misdemeanors and immoralities, as profane cursing and swearing,\r\nbetting and gaming, horse racing, disturbing religious meetings,\r\nsabbath-breaking, trespasses and injury to property, and many disorderly\r\npractices, all of which are punishable in a like manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLaw of Nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LXIII.\r\n\r\nOrigin and Progress of the Law of Nations; the Natural, Customary, and\r\nConventional Laws of Nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. The _law of nations_ consists of those rules by which intercourse\r\nbetween nations is regulated. In its present improved state, the law of\r\nnations has not long existed. Ancient nations were little governed by\r\nthe principles of natural justice. Little respect was paid by one nation\r\nto the persons and property of the citizens of another. Robbery on land\r\nand sea was not only tolerated, but esteemed honorable; and prisoners of\r\nwar were either put to death, or reduced to slavery. By this rule of\r\nnational law, commerce was destroyed, and perpetual enmity kept up\r\nbetween nations.\r\n\r\n§2. Within the last three or four centuries, essential improvement in\r\nthe law of nations has been made. By the light of science and\r\nChristianity, the rights and obligations of nations have come to be\r\nbetter understood, and more generally regarded. Commerce also has done\r\nmuch to improve the law, by showing that the true interests of a nation\r\nare promoted by peace and friendly intercourse.\r\n\r\n§3. Hence we find the nations of Europe and America recognizing the same\r\nrules of international law. And as the light and power of Christianity\r\nshall increase, the law of nations will undergo still further\r\nimprovements. And it is to be hoped, that, as one of these improvements,\r\nthe practice of settling national disputes by war will be abolished, and\r\nthe more rational and humane course be adopted, of referring\r\ndifficulties which the parties are incapable of adjusting, to some\r\ndisinterested power for adjudication.\r\n\r\n§4. There are, in every nation or state, courts of justice to try and\r\npunish offenders; but there is no tribunal before which one nation can\r\nbe brought to answer for the violation of the rights of another. Every\r\nnation, however small and weak, is independent of every other.\r\nTherefore, when injuries are committed by one upon another, the offended\r\nparty, unless it chooses quietly to endure the wrong must seek redress,\r\neither by appealing to the sense of justice of the party offending, or\r\nby a resort to force.\r\n\r\n§5. Every nation has a right to establish such government as it thinks\r\nproper; and no other nation has a right to interfere with its internal\r\npolicy. To this rule, however, some writers make an exception. They hold\r\nthat the natural right of a state to provide for its own safety, gives\r\nit the right to interfere where its security is seriously endangered by\r\nthe internal transactions of another state. But it is admitted that such\r\ncases are so very rare, that it would be dangerous to reduce them to a\r\nrule.\r\n\r\n§6. So cases seldom arise in which one nation has a right to assist the\r\nsubjects of another in overturning or changing their government. It is\r\ngenerally agreed, that such assistance may be afforded consistently with\r\nthe law of nations, in extreme cases; as when the tyranny of a\r\ngovernment becomes so oppressive, as to compel the people to rise in\r\ntheir defense, and call for assistance. When the subjects of any\r\ngovernment have carried their revolt so far as to have established a new\r\nstate, and to give reasonable evidence of their ability to maintain a\r\ngovernment, the right of assistance is unquestionable. But it is not\r\nclear that, prior to this state of progress in a revolution, the right\r\nto interpose would be justifiable.\r\n\r\n§7. There is a sense, however, in which nations are not wholly\r\nindependent. Mankind in the social state, as we have seen, are dependent\r\nupon each other for assistance. (Chap. I, §2.) Such is, in a measure,\r\nthe mutual dependence of nations. Although the people of every nation\r\nhave within themselves the means of maintaining their individual and\r\nnational existence, their prosperity and happiness are greatly promoted\r\nby commerce with other nations. And as laws are necessary to govern the\r\nconduct of the individual citizens of a state, so certain rules are\r\nnecessary to regulate the intercourse of nations.\r\n\r\n§8. It has been observed, also, that the law of nature is a perfect rule\r\nfor all moral and social beings, and ought to be universally obeyed.\r\nEqually binding is this law upon nations. It requires each nation to\r\nrespect the rights of all others, and to do for them what their\r\nnecessities demand, and what it is capable of doing, consistently with\r\nthe duties it owes to itself. And the general good of mankind is as\r\nreally promoted by the application of this law to the affairs of\r\nnations, as by its application to the affairs of individuals.\r\n\r\n§9. The law of nature applied to nations or states as moral persons, is\r\ncalled the _natural law of nations_. It is also called the _necessary\r\nlaw of nations_, because nations are morally bound to observe it; and\r\nsometimes the _internal law of nations_, from its being binding on the\r\nconscience.\r\n\r\n§10. Although the law of nature, as expressed in the law of revelation,\r\nis a correct rule of human conduct; yet, as much of this law consists of\r\ngeneral principles from which particular duties can not always be\r\ndeduced, positive human enactments are necessary to define the law of\r\nnature and revelation. So an important part of the law of nations\r\nnecessarily consists of positive institutions. Hence some writers have\r\ndivided international law under these two principal heads: the _natural_\r\nlaw of nations, and the _positive_.\r\n\r\n§11. The _positive law of nations_ is founded on usage or custom and\r\nagreement, and may be considered as properly divided into the\r\n_customary_ law of nations, and the _conventional_. The _customary law\r\nof nations_ consists of certain maxims, or is founded on customs and\r\nusages which have been long observed and tacitly consented to by\r\nnations, and have thereby become binding upon all who have adopted them,\r\nso far as their observance does not require a violation of the law of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n§12. A _conventional law of nations_ is one that has been established by\r\na treaty or league. The word _convention_ usually signifies an assembly\r\nof persons met for some benevolent, political, or ecclesiastical\r\npurpose. It also signifies a treaty, or agreement between nations; and\r\nsuch agreement or contract, though made without a formal meeting, is\r\ndeemed conventional.\r\n\r\n§13. As the law of nature is liable to misconstruction, and as the law\r\nof usage or custom is vague and uncertain, _conventional_ law, because\r\nmore definite, has been found to afford greater security to the rights\r\nof commerce. Hence the practice, now so common among nations, of\r\nregulating their intercourse by negotiation. By treaties, the rights of\r\nthe contracting parties are placed beyond dispute.\r\n\r\n§14. But it may be said, if each nation is independent of every other,\r\nand if there is no constituted authority to enforce the fulfillment of\r\ntreaty stipulations, the rights guarantied by treaties are still\r\ninsecure. But few governments are so devoid of a sense of honor as, by a\r\npalpable violation of treaty obligations, to incur the odium and\r\ncondemnation of all mankind. Self-respect and the fear of provoking a\r\nwar, have generally proved sufficient incentives to the observance of\r\ntreaties.\r\n\r\n§15. The obligations of nations are sometimes called _imperfect_. A\r\n_perfect obligation_ is one that can be enforced--one that exists where\r\nthere is a right to compel the party on whom the obligation rests to\r\nfulfill it. An _imperfect obligation_ gives only the right to demand the\r\nfulfillment, leaving the party pledged to judge what his duty requires,\r\nand to do as he chooses, without being constrained by another to do\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LXIV.\r\n\r\nThe Jurisdiction of Nations; their mutual Rights and Obligations; the\r\nRights of Embassadors, Ministers, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. The seas are regarded as the common highway of nations. The main\r\nocean, for navigation and fishing, is open to all mankind. Every state,\r\nhowever, has jurisdiction at sea over its own subjects in its own public\r\nand private vessels. The persons on board such vessels are protected and\r\ngoverned by the laws of the country to which they belong, and may be\r\npunished by these laws for offenses committed on board of its public\r\nvessels in foreign ports.\r\n\r\n§2. The question how far a nation has jurisdiction over the seas\r\nadjoining its lands, is not clearly settled. It appears to be generally\r\nconceded, that a nation has a right of exclusive dominion over navigable\r\nrivers flowing through its territory; the harbors, bays, gulfs, and arms\r\nof the sea; and such extent of sea adjoining its territories as is\r\nnecessary to the safety of the nation, which is considered by some to be\r\nas far as a cannon shot will reach, or about a marine league.\r\n\r\n§3. It is the duty of a nation in time of peace, to allow the people of\r\nother states a passage over its lands and waters, so far as it can be\r\npermitted without inconvenience, and with safety to its own citizens. Of\r\nthis the nation is to be its own judge. The right of passage is only an\r\n_imperfect right_, because the obligation to grant the right is an\r\n_imperfect obligation_. (Chap. LXIII, §15.)\r\n\r\n§4. In general, it is the duty of a nation to allow foreigners to enter\r\nand settle in the country. On being admitted into a state, the state\r\nbecomes pledged for their protection, and they become subject to its\r\nlaws; and in consideration of the protection they receive, they are\r\nobliged to aid in defending it, and in supporting its government, even\r\nbefore they are admitted to all the rights of citizens.\r\n\r\n§5. But no state is bound to shelter criminals fleeing into it from a\r\nforeign state. They can be tried only in the state whose laws they have\r\nviolated. It is therefore the duty of the government to surrender a\r\nfugitive on demand of the proper authorities of the state from which he\r\nfled, if, after due examination by a civil magistrate, there shall\r\nappear sufficient grounds for the charge. The surrender of criminals is\r\nsometimes provided for in treaties.\r\n\r\n§6. The rule which makes foreigners amenable to the laws of the state in\r\nwhich they remove, does not apply to embassadors. They are not\r\nresponsible to the laws of the country to which they are sent, even when\r\nguilty of crime. When their conduct is dangerous to the government and\r\nits citizens, all that can be done is, either to deprive them of liberty\r\nby confinement, or to send them home and demand their punishment. As\r\nevery nation has a right to treat and communicate with all others, it\r\nought not to be deprived of the services of its representative. Hence,\r\nthe persons and property of all public ministers are held sacred and\r\ninviolable.\r\n\r\n§7. Embassadors are entitled to the same protection in the countries\r\nthrough which they pass in going to, and returning from the government\r\nto which they are sent. And to insure them a safe passage, some\r\ngovernments have given them passports to be shown if required. A\r\n_passport_ is a written license from the authority of a state granting\r\npermission or safe conduct for one to pass through its territory.\r\nPassports, though named in our law, are not known in practice, being\r\ndeemed unnecessary.\r\n\r\n§8. If a minister at a foreign court treats the sovereign with\r\ndisrespect, the fact is sometimes communicated to the government that\r\nsent him, with a request for his recall. Or, if the offense is a more\r\nserious one, the offended sovereign refuses intercourse with him while\r\nhis master's answer is awaited. Or, if the case is an aggravated one, he\r\nexpels him from the country.\r\n\r\n§9. Ministers at foreign governments, in their negotiations or business\r\ncorrespondence with those governments, sometimes consider themselves ill\r\ntreated, and their own nation dishonored, and take their leave and\r\nreturn home; or the minister informs his sovereign, who either recalls\r\nhim, or takes such other measure as he thinks the honor and interest of\r\nhis nation demand.\r\n\r\n§10. The peculiar condition of a country, the nature of the business\r\nupon which an embassador is sent, or the personal character of the\r\nembassador, may be such as to justify a government in refusing to\r\nreceive him. But to preserve the friendly relations of the two\r\ncountries, satisfactory explanations ought to be made, or good reasons\r\noffered for the refusal.\r\n\r\n§11. A minister can not bind his sovereign to any treaty or agreement,\r\nconclusively, under the authority of an ordinary credential, or letter\r\nof attorney. He can not do so without a special power, containing\r\nexpress authority so to bind his principal. Ministers act under secret\r\ninstructions which they are not bound to disclose. Even the treaties\r\nsigned by plenipotentiaries, (a word signifying full power,) are,\r\naccording to present usage, of no force, until ratified by their\r\ngovernments.\r\n\r\n§12. Consuls are not entitled to the privilege enjoyed by ministers,\r\nbut are subject to the laws of the country in which they reside. Their\r\nprincipal duties have been described. (Chap. XL, §9.) The office of\r\nconsul has been found to be one of great utility; hence, every trading\r\nnation has a consul in every considerable commercial port in the world.\r\nAs in the case of ministers, consuls carry a certificate of their\r\nappointment, and must be acknowledged as consuls by the government of\r\nthe country in which they reside, before they can perform any duties\r\npertaining to their office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LXV.\r\n\r\nOffensive and Defensive War; just Causes and Objects of War; Reprisals;\r\nAlliances in War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. Wars are offensive and defensive. The use of force to obtain justice\r\nfor injuries done, is _offensive war_. The making use of force against\r\nany power that attacks a nation or its privileges, is _defensive war_. A\r\nwar may be defensive in its principles, though offensive in its\r\noperation. For example: one nation is preparing to invade another; but\r\nbefore the threatened invasion takes place, the latter attacks the\r\nformer as the best mode of repelling the invasion. In this case, the\r\nparty making the attack acts on the _defensive_. (§10.) The contending\r\nparties are called _belligerents_. The word _belligerent_ is from the\r\nLatin _bellum_, war, and _gero_, to wage or carry on. Nations that take\r\nno part in the contest, are called _neutrals_.\r\n\r\n§2. War ought never to be undertaken without the most cogent reasons. In\r\nthe first place, there must be a _right_ to make war, and _just grounds_\r\nfor making it. Nations have no right to employ force any further than is\r\nnecessary for their own defense, and for the maintenance of their\r\nrights. Secondly, it should be made from _proper motives_, the good of\r\nthe state, and the safety and common advantage of the citizens. Hence,\r\nthere may be, according to the law of nations, just cause of war, when\r\nit would be inexpedient to involve the nation in such a calamity.\r\n\r\n§3. The numerous objects of a lawful war may be reduced to these three:\r\n(1.) To recover what belongs to us, or to obtain satisfaction for\r\ninjuries. (2.) To provide for our future safety by punishing the\r\noffender. (3.) To defend or protect ourselves from injury by repelling\r\nunjust attacks. The first and second are objects of an _offensive_ war;\r\nthe third is that of a _defensive_ war.\r\n\r\n§4. Injury to an individual citizen of a state, by the subjects of\r\nanother state, is deemed a just cause of war, if the persons offending,\r\nor the government of the state to which they belong, do not make\r\nreparation for the injury; for every nation is responsible for the good\r\nbehavior of its subjects. But, although this would, according to the law\r\nof nations, afford justifiable cause of war, neither the honor nor the\r\ntrue interest of a nation requires that war should always be made for so\r\nslight a cause.\r\n\r\n§5. Generally, the injury sought to be redressed should be serious, and\r\nsatisfaction be demanded and refused, before recourse should be had to\r\narms. Where there is a question of right between the parties, the\r\ngovernment making war should have no reasonable doubt of the justice of\r\nits claim. And even when no such doubt exists, it would be the duty of\r\nsuch government to prevent a war, if possible, by proposals of\r\ncompromise. It is believed that war ought in no case to be made, until\r\nattempts have been made to effect an adjustment of difficulties by\r\ncompromise, or by offers to submit them for arbitration.\r\n\r\n§6. One of the means by which satisfaction is sought without making war,\r\nis that of _reprisals_. (Chap. XXXVI, §4, 5.) If a nation has taken what\r\nbelongs to another, or refuses to pay a debt, or to make satisfaction\r\nfor an injury, the offended nation seizes something belonging to the\r\nformer or to her citizens, and retains it, or applies it to her own\r\nadvantage, till she obtains satisfaction: and when there shall be no\r\nlonger any hope of satisfaction, the effects thus seized are\r\nconfiscated. To _confiscate_ is to adjudge property to be forfeited, and\r\nto appropriate it to the use and benefit of the state. But as the loss\r\nin this case would fall upon unoffending citizens, it is the duty of\r\ntheir government to grant them indemnity.\r\n\r\n§7. But to justify reprisals by the law of nations, the grounds upon\r\nwhich they are authorized must be just and well ascertained. If the\r\nright of the party demanding satisfaction is doubtful, he must first\r\ndemand an equitable examination of his claim, and next be able to show\r\nthat justice has been refused, before he can justly take the matter into\r\nhis own hands. He has no right to disturb the peace and safety of\r\nnations on a doubtful pretension. But if the other party refuses to have\r\nthe matter brought to the proof, or to accede to any proposition to\r\nterminate the dispute in a peaceable manner, reprisals become lawful.\r\n\r\n§8. By treaties of alliance, nations sometimes agree to assist each\r\nother in case of war with a third power. It is a question not clearly\r\nsettled, whether the government that is to afford the aid is bound to do\r\nso when it deems the war to be unjust. The reasonable conclusion seems\r\nto be, that, in cases simply doubtful, the justice of the war is to be\r\npresumed; and the government pledging its aid is bound to fulfill its\r\nengagement. The contrary doctrine would furnish a nation with too ready\r\na pretext for violating its pledge. In cases only of the clearest\r\ninjustice on the part of its ally, can a nation rightfully avoid a\r\npositive engagement to afford assistance.\r\n\r\n§9. But when the object of the war is hopeless, or when the state under\r\nsuch engagement would, by furnishing the assistance, endanger its own\r\nsafety, it is not bound to render the aid. But the danger must not be\r\nslight, remote, or uncertain. None but extreme cases would afford\r\nsufficient cause for withholding the promised assistance.\r\n\r\n§10. When the alliance is defensive, the treaty binds each party to\r\nassist the other only when engaged in a defensive war, and unjustly\r\nattacked. By the conventional law of nations, the government that first\r\ndeclares, or actually begins the war, is considered as making\r\n_offensive_ war; and though it should not be the first actually to apply\r\nforce, yet if it first renders the application of force necessary, it is\r\nthe aggressor; and the other party, though the first to apply force, is\r\nengaged in a _defensive_ war. (§1.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LXVI.\r\n\r\nDeclaration of War; its Effect upon the Person and Property of the\r\nEnemy's subjects; Stratagems in War; Privateering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. When a nation has resolved on making war, it is usual to announce\r\nthe fact by a public declaration. In monarchical governments, the power\r\nto declare war, which of course includes the right of determining the\r\nquestion whether it shall be made, is vested in the king. In the United\r\nStates, this power is, by the constitution, given to the representatives\r\nof the people, for reasons elsewhere stated. (Chap. XXXVI, §3.)\r\n\r\n§2. It was usual, formerly, to communicate a declaration of war to the\r\nenemy. According to modern practice, a formal declaration to the enemy\r\nis not required. Any manifesto or paper from an official source,\r\nannouncing that the country is in a state of war, is considered\r\nsufficient. The recalling of a minister has alone been regarded as a\r\nhostile act, and followed by war, without any other declaration. But\r\nsuch cases have not been frequent. Under ordinary circumstances, the\r\nrecall of a minister is not an offensive act.\r\n\r\n§3. The government of a state acts for and in behalf of all its\r\ncitizens; and its acts are binding upon all. Hence, when war is\r\ndeclared, it is not merely a war between the two governments; all the\r\nsubjects of the government declaring it become enemies to all the\r\nsubjects of that against which it is declared.\r\n\r\n§4. Whether, on the occurrence of a war in any state, the subjects of\r\nthe enemy found within the state may be detained as prisoners of war,\r\nand their movable property confiscated; or whether they are entitled to\r\na reasonable time to retire with their effects, is a question upon which\r\nwriters of public law are not agreed. Few civilized nations, at the\r\npresent day, would deny such persons a reasonable time to retire with\r\ntheir property. Of houses and lands, all admit that only the income is\r\nsubject to confiscation. The privilege spoken of, instead of being left\r\nto uncertainty, is now, with great propriety, generally secured by\r\ntreaty.\r\n\r\n§5. When war is declared, all intercourse between the two countries at\r\nonce ceases. All trade between the citizens, directly or indirectly, is\r\nstrictly forbidden; and all contracts with the enemy made during the war\r\nare void.\r\n\r\n§6. Although a state of war makes all the subjects of one nation enemies\r\nof all those of the other, they cannot lawfully engage in offensive\r\nhostilities without permission of their government. If they have no\r\nwritten commission as evidence of such permission, and if they should be\r\ntaken by the enemy, they would not be entitled to the usual mild\r\ntreatment which other prisoners of war receive, but might be treated\r\nwithout mercy as lawless robbers and banditti.\r\n\r\n§7. As the object of a just war is to obtain justice, a nation, when it\r\nhas declared war, has a right to use all necessary means, and no other,\r\nfor attaining that end. A just war gives the right to take the life of\r\nthe enemy; but there are limits to this right. If an enemy submits, and\r\nlays down his arms, we can not justly take his life. And justice and\r\nhumanity forbid that women, children, feeble old men, and sick persons,\r\nwho make no resistance, should be maltreated.\r\n\r\n§8. Prisoners of war are not to be treated with cruelty. They may be\r\nconfined, and even fettered, if there is reason to apprehend that they\r\nwill rise against their captors, or make their escape. Prisoners of war\r\nare detained to prevent their returning to join the enemy, or to obtain\r\nfrom their government a just satisfaction as the price of their liberty.\r\nPrisoners may be kept till the end of the war. Then, or at any time\r\nduring the war, the government may exchange them for its own soldiers\r\ntaken prisoner by the enemy; or a ransom may be required for their\r\nrelease. It is the duty of the government to procure, at its own\r\nexpense, the release of its citizens.\r\n\r\n§9. Ravaging a country, burning private dwellings, or otherwise wantonly\r\ndestroying property, is not justifiable, except in cases of absolute\r\nnecessity. But all fortresses, ramparts, and the like, being\r\nappropriated to the purposes of war, may be destroyed.\r\n\r\n§10. Stratagems and deceit to obtain advantage of an enemy, are, to some\r\nextent, justified by the law of nations; but in general they are\r\ndishonorable and wrong.\r\n\r\n§11. Spies are sometimes sent among an enemy, to discover the state of\r\nhis affairs, to pry into his designs, and carry back information. This\r\nis a dishonorable office; spies, if detected, are condemned to death.\r\n\r\n§12. The rights of a nation in war at sea are essentially different from\r\nthose in war upon land. The object of a maritime war is to destroy the\r\ncommerce and navigation of the enemy, with a view of weakening his naval\r\npower. To this end, the capture or destruction of private property is\r\nnecessary, and is justified by the law of nations. Hence, for the\r\npurpose of attack as well as defense, every nation of considerable power\r\nor commercial importance, keeps a _navy_, consisting of a number of war\r\nvessels, ready for service.\r\n\r\n§13. Besides these national ships of war, there are armed vessels owned\r\nby private citizens, and called _privateers_. Their owners receive from\r\nthe government a commission to go on the seas, and to capture any vessel\r\nof the enemy, whether it is owned by the government or by private\r\ncitizens, or whether it is armed or not. And to encourage privateering,\r\nthe government allows the owner and crew of a privateer to keep the\r\nproperty captured as their own.\r\n\r\n§14. To prevent the abuse of this right, the owners are required to give\r\nsecurity, that the cruise shall be conducted according to instructions\r\nand the usages of war; that the rights of neutral nations shall not be\r\nviolated; and that the captured property shall be brought in for\r\nadjudication.\r\n\r\n§15. When a prize is brought into a port, the captors make a writing,\r\ncalled _libel_, stating the facts of the capture, and praying that the\r\nproperty may be condemned; and this paper is filed in the proper court.\r\nIf it shall be made to appear that the property was taken from the\r\nenemy, the court condemns the property as _prize_, which is then sold,\r\nand the proceeds are distributed among the captors.\r\n\r\n§16. All prizes, whether taken by a public or private armed vessel,\r\nprimarily belong to the sovereign; and no person has any interest in a\r\nprize, except what he receives from the state: and due proof must in all\r\ncases be made before the proper court, that the seizure was lawfully\r\nmade. In this country, prizes are proved and condemned in a district\r\ncourt of the United States, which, when sitting that purpose, is called\r\na _prize court_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LXVII.\r\n\r\nRights and Duties of Neutral Nations; Contraband Goods; Blockade; Right\r\nof Search; Safe Conducts and Passports; Truces; Treaties of Peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. A neutral nation is bound to observe a strict impartiality toward\r\nthe parties at war. If she should aid one party to the injury of the\r\nother, she would be liable to be herself treated as an enemy. A loan of\r\nmoney to one of the belligerents, or supplying him with other means of\r\ncarrying on a war, if done with the view of aiding him in the war, would\r\nbe a violation of neutrality. But an engagement made in time of peace to\r\nfurnish a nation a certain number of ships, or troops, or other articles\r\nof war, may afterward, in time of war, be fulfilled.\r\n\r\n§2. A nation is not bound, however, on the occurrence of a war, to\r\nchange its customary trade, and to cease supplying a belligerent with\r\narticles of trade which such belligerent was wont to receive from her,\r\nalthough the goods may afford him the means of carrying on the war. So\r\nif a nation has been accustomed to lend money to another for interest,\r\nand the latter should become engaged in war with a third power, the\r\nneutral would not break her neutrality if she should continue to lend\r\nher money. The wrong in any case lies in the _intention_ to aid one to\r\nthe detriment of the other.\r\n\r\n§3. This rule, it is believed, is universally admitted in cases of\r\nbelligerents going themselves to a neutral country to make their\r\npurchases. But whether a neutral nation is at full liberty to _carry the\r\ngoods_ in the cases mentioned, is not so certain. A nation in a just war\r\nhas a right to deprive her enemy of the means of resisting or injuring\r\nher, and therefore may lawfully intercept every thing of a warlike\r\nnature which a neutral is carrying to such enemy.\r\n\r\n§4. Articles which a neutral nation is not allowed to carry to an enemy,\r\nare called contraband goods. What these are, it is impossible to say\r\nwith precision, as some articles may in certain cases be lawfully\r\ncarried, which would be justly prohibited under other circumstances.\r\nAmong the articles usually contraband, are arms, ammunition, materials\r\nfor ship-building, naval stores, horses, and sometimes even provisions.\r\n\r\n§5. Contraband goods, when ascertained to be such, are confiscated to\r\nthe captors as lawful prize. Formerly the vessel also was liable to be\r\ncondemned and confiscated; but the modern practice, it is said, exempts\r\nthe ship, unless it belongs to the owner of the contraband articles, or\r\nthe carrying of them is connected with aggravating circumstances.\r\n\r\n§6. One of the rights of a belligerent nation which a neutral is bound\r\nto regard, is the right of blockade. _Blockade_ is a blocking up. A war\r\nblockade is the stationing of ships of war at the entrance of an enemy's\r\nports, to prevent all vessels from coming out or going in. The object of\r\na blockade is to hinder supplies of arms, ammunition, and provisions\r\nfrom entering, with a view to compel a surrender by hunger and want,\r\nwithout an attack. A neutral vessel attempting to enter or depart,\r\nbecomes liable to be seized and condemned. Towns and fortresses also may\r\nbe shut up by posting troops at the avenues.\r\n\r\n§7. A simple decree or order declaring a certain coast or country in a\r\nstate of blockade, does not constitute a blockade. A force must be\r\nstationed there, competent to maintain the blockade, and to make it\r\ndangerous to enter. And it is necessary that the neutral should have due\r\nnotice of the blockade, in order to subject his property to condemnation\r\nand forfeiture. According to modern usage, if a place is blockaded by\r\nsea only, trade with it by a neutral nation may be carried on by inland\r\ncommunication. And a neutral vessel, loaded before the blockade was\r\nestablished, has a right to leave the port with her cargo.\r\n\r\n§8. To prevent the conveyance of contraband goods, the law of nations\r\ngives a belligerent nation the _right of search_; that is, the right, in\r\ntime of war, to search neutral vessels, to ascertain their character,\r\nand what articles are on board. A neutral vessel refusing to be searched\r\nby a lawful cruiser, would thereby render herself liable to condemnation\r\nas a prize. Private merchant vessels only are subject to search; the\r\nright does not extend to public ships of war.\r\n\r\n§9. The property of an enemy found on board of a neutral vessel, may be\r\nseized, if the vessel is beyond the limits of the jurisdiction of the\r\nnation to which she belongs; but the vessel is not confiscated; and the\r\nmaster is entitled to freight for the carriage of the goods. The\r\n_property of neutrals_ found in an enemy's vessels, is to be restored to\r\nthe owners.\r\n\r\n§10. A neutral is forbidden by the law and practice of nations, to\r\npermit a belligerent to arm and equip vessels of war within her forts.\r\nNor may the citizens of a nation fit out any vessel, or enlist, to go\r\nbeyond the limits of their own country to assist any people in war\r\nagainst another with whom they are at peace.\r\n\r\n§11. It is sometimes agreed to suspend hostilities for a time. If the\r\nagreement is only for a short period, for the purpose of burying the\r\ndead after battle, or for a parley between the hostile generals; or if\r\nit regards only some particular place, it is called a cessation or\r\n_suspension of arms_; if for a considerable time, and especially if\r\ngeneral, it is called a _truce_. By a partial truce, hostilities are\r\nsuspended in certain places, as between a town and the general besieging\r\nit; and generals have power to make such truces. By a general truce,\r\nhostilities are to cease generally, and in all places, and are made by\r\nthe governments or sovereigns. Such truces afford opportunities for\r\nnations to settle their disputes by negotiation.\r\n\r\n§12. A truce binds the contracting parties from the time it is made; but\r\nindividuals of the nation are not responsible for its violation before\r\nthey have had due notice of it. And for all prizes taken after the time\r\nof its commencement, the government is bound to make restitution. During\r\nthe cessation of hostilities, each party may, within his own\r\nterritories, continue his preparations for war, without being charged\r\nwith a breach of good faith.\r\n\r\n§13. War is generally terminated, and peace secured, by _treaties of\r\npeace_. The manner of making treaties has been described. (Chap. XL,\r\n§5.) A treaty of peace puts an end to the war, and leaves the\r\ncontracting parties no right to take up arms for the same cause.\r\n\r\n§14. The parties to a treaty of peace are bound by it from the time of\r\nits conclusion, which is the day on which it is signed; but, as in the\r\ncase of a truce, persons are not held responsible for any hostile acts\r\ncommitted before the treaty was known; and their government is bound to\r\norder and enforce the restitution of property captured subsequently to\r\nthe conclusion of the treaty.\r\n\r\n§15. War is sometimes terminated by _mediation_. A friend to both\r\nparties, desirous of stopping the destruction of human life, kindly\r\nendeavors to reconcile the parties. The friendly sovereign who thus\r\ninterposes, is called _mediator_. Many desolating wars might have been\r\nearly arrested in this way, or wholly prevented, had there always been\r\namong friendly powers a disposition to reconcile contending nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSynopsis of the State Constitutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMaine.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe District of Maine, formerly belonging to the state of Massachusetts,\r\nadopted in convention, October 29, 1819, the present constitution, and\r\nwas admitted into the Union as a state, March 15, 1820.

The judges both of the\r\nsupreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good\r\nbehavior; and shall, at stated times, receive for their services a\r\ncompensation which shall not be diminished during their continuance in\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nSec. 2. The judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and\r\nequity, arising under this constitution, the laws of the United States\r\nand treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority; to all\r\ncases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls; to all\r\ncases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; to controversies to which\r\nthe United States shall be a party, to controversies between two or more\r\nstates; between a state and citizens of another state; between citizens\r\nof different states; between citizens of the same state claiming lands\r\nunder grants of different states; and between a state, or the citizens\r\nthereof; and foreign states, citizens or subjects.\r\n\r\nIn all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls,\r\nand those in which a state shall be a party, the supreme court shall\r\nhave original jurisdiction. In all the other cases before mentioned, the\r\nsupreme court shall have appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and\r\nfact, with such exceptions, and under such regulations, as the congress\r\nshall make.\r\n\r\nThe trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by\r\njury; and such trial shall be held in the state where the said crimes\r\nshall have been committed; but when not committed within any state, the\r\ntrial shall be at such place or places as the congress may by law have\r\ndirected.\r\n\r\nSec. 3.

Full faith and credit shall be given, in each state,\r\nto the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other\r\nstate.
