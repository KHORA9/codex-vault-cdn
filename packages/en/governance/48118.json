The series of books promised in the\r\nPreface to the author's _Municipal Ownership in Great Britain_ will,\r\ntherefore, number not four, but five.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I\r\n  INTRODUCTION                                                       3\r\n\r\n     Scope of the inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER II\r\n  THE ARGUMENT FOR THE NATIONALIZATION OF THE TELEGRAPHS            13\r\n\r\n     The indictment of the telegraph companies. The argument\r\n     from foreign experience. The promise of reduced tariffs\r\n     and increased facilities. The alleged financial success of\r\n     foreign State telegraphs: Belgium, Switzerland and France. The\r\n     argument from English company experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER III\r\n  THE ALLEGED BREAK-DOWN OF LAISSEZ-FAIRE                           36\r\n\r\n     Early history of telegraphy in Great Britain. The adequacy of\r\n     private enterprise. Mr. Scudamore's loose use of statistics.\r\n     Mr. Scudamore's test of adequacy of facilities. Telegraphic\r\n     charges and growth of traffic in Great Britain. The alleged\r\n     wastefulness of competition. The telegraph companies' proposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER IV\r\n  THE PURCHASE OF THE TELEGRAPHS                                    57\r\n\r\n     Upon inadequate consideration the Disraeli Ministry estimates\r\n     at $15,000,000 to $20,000,000 the cost of nationalization.\r\n     Political expediency responsible for Government's inadequate\r\n     investigation. The Government raises its estimate to\r\n     $30,000,000; adding that it could afford to pay $40,000,000\r\n     to $50,000,000. Mr. Goschen, M. P., and Mr. Leeman, M. P.,\r\n     warn the House of Commons against the Government's estimates,\r\n     which had been prepared by Mr. Scudamore. The Gladstone\r\n     Ministry, relying on Mr. Scudamore, estimates at $3,500,000\r\n     the \"reversionary rights\" of the railway companies, for which\r\n     rights the State ultimately paid $10,000,000 to $11,000,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER V\r\n  NONE OF MR. SCUDAMORE'S FINANCIAL FORECASTS WERE REALIZED         77\r\n\r\n     The completion of the telegraph system costs $8,500,000;\r\n     Mr. Scudamore's successive estimates had been respectively\r\n     $1,000,000 and $1,500,000. Mr. Scudamore's brilliant forecast\r\n     of the increase of traffic under public ownership. Mr.\r\n     Scudamore's appalling blunder in predicting that the State\r\n     telegraphs would be self-supporting. Operating expenses on the\r\n     average exceed 92.5% of the gross earnings, in contrast to\r\n     Mr. Scudamore's estimate of 51% to 56%. The annual telegraph\r\n     deficits aggregate 26.5% of the capital invested in the plant.\r\n     The financial failure of the State telegraphs is not due to\r\n     the large price paid to the telegraph companies and railway\r\n     companies. The disillusionment of an eminent advocate of\r\n     nationalization, Mr. W. Stanley Jevons.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VI\r\n  THE PARTY LEADERS IGNORE THEIR FEAR OF AN ORGANIZED CIVIL\r\n  SERVICE                                                           94\r\n\r\n     Mr. Disraeli, Chancellor of the Exchequer, opposes the\r\n     enfranchisement of the civil servants. Mr. Gladstone, Leader\r\n     of the Opposition, assents to enfranchisement, but expresses\r\n     grave apprehensions of evil results.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VII\r\n  THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FINANCIAL FAILURE OF\r\n  THE STATE TELEGRAPHS                                              99\r\n\r\n     Sir S. Northcote, Chancellor of the Exchequer in Mr.\r\n     Disraeli's Ministry of 1874 to 1880, is disillusioned. The\r\n     State telegraphs become self-supporting in 1879-80. The House\r\n     of Commons, under the leadership of Dr. Cameron, M. P., for\r\n     Glasgow, overrides the Ministry and cuts the tariff almost in\r\n     two. In 1890-91 the State telegraphs would again have become\r\n     self-supporting, had not the House of Commons, under pressure\r\n     from the civil service unions, increased wages and salaries.\r\n     The necessity of making money is the only effective incentive\r\n     to sound management.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VIII\r\n  THE STATE TELEGRAPHS SUBSIDIZE THE NEWSPAPER PRESS               113\r\n\r\n     Why the newspaper press demanded nationalization. Mr.\r\n     Scudamore gives the newspaper press a tariff which he deems\r\n     unprofitable. Estimates of the loss involved in transmitting\r\n     press messages, made by responsible persons in the period from\r\n     1876 to 1900. The State telegraphs subsidize betting on horse\r\n     races.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER IX\r\n  THE POST OFFICE EMPLOYEES PRESS THE HOUSE OF COMMONS FOR INCREASES\r\n  OF WAGES AND SALARIES                                            127\r\n\r\n     British Government's policy as to wages and salaries for\r\n     routine work, as distinguished from work requiring a high\r\n     order of intelligence. The Fawcett revision of wages, 1881.\r\n     Lord Frederick Cavendish, Financial Secretary to the Treasury,\r\n     on pressure exerted on Members of Parliament by the telegraph\r\n     employees. Sir S. A. Blackwood, Permanent Secretary to the\r\n     Post Office, on the Fawcett revision of 1881. Evidence as to\r\n     civil servants' pressure on Members of Parliament presented\r\n     to the Royal Commission on Civil Establishments, 1888. The\r\n     Raikes revision of 1890-91; based largely on the Report of the\r\n     Committee on the Indoor Staff, which Committee had recommended\r\n     increases in order \"to end agitation.\" The Earl Compton, M.\r\n     P., champions the cause of the postal employees in 1890; and\r\n     moves for a Select Committee in 1891. Sir James Fergusson,\r\n     Postmaster General in the Salisbury Ministry, issues an\r\n     order against Post Office servants \"endeavoring to extract\r\n     promises from any candidate for election to the House of\r\n     Commons with reference to their pay or duties.\" The Gladstone\r\n     Ministry rescinds Sir James Fergusson's order. Mr. Macdonald's\r\n     Motion, in 1893, for a House of Commons Select Committee. Mr.\r\n     Kearley's Motion, in 1895. The Government compromises, and\r\n     appoints the so-called Tweedmouth Inter-Departmental Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER X\r\n  THE TWEEDMOUTH COMMITTEE REPORT                                  165\r\n\r\n     The Government accepts all recommendations made by the\r\n     Committee. Sir Albert K. Rollit, one of the principal\r\n     champions in the House of Commons of the postal employees,\r\n     immediately follows with a Motion \"intended to reflect\r\n     upon the Report of the Tweedmouth Committee.\" Mr. Hanbury,\r\n     Financial Secretary to the Treasury, intimates that it\r\n     may become necessary to disfranchise the civil servants.\r\n     The Treasury accepts the recommendations of the so-called\r\n     Norfolk-Hanbury Committee. The average of expenses on account\r\n     of wages and salaries rises from 11.54 cents per telegram\r\n     in 1895-96, to 13.02 cents in 1902-03, concomitantly with\r\n     an increase in the number of telegrams from 79,423,000 to\r\n     92,471,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XI\r\n  THE POST OFFICE EMPLOYEES CONTINUE TO PRESS THE HOUSE OF COMMONS\r\n  FOR INCREASES OF WAGES AND SALARIES                              182\r\n\r\n     The Post Office employees demand \"a new judgment on the\r\n     old facts.\" Mr. S. Woods' Motion, in February, 1898. Mr.\r\n     Steadman's Motions in February and June, 1899. Mr. Hanbury,\r\n     Financial Secretary to the Treasury, points out that the\r\n     postal employees are demanding a House of Commons Select\r\n     Committee because under such a Committee \"the agitation and\r\n     pressure, now distributed over the whole House, would be\r\n     focussed and concentrated upon the Select Committee.\" Mr.\r\n     Steadman's Motion, in April, 1900. Mr. Bayley's Motion, in\r\n     June, 1901. Mr. Balfour, Prime Minister, confesses that the\r\n     debate has filled him \"with considerable anxiety as to the\r\n     future of the public service if pressure of the kind which\r\n     has been put upon the Government to-night is persisted in\r\n     by the House.\" Captain Norton's Motion, in April, 1902. The\r\n     Government compromises by appointing the Bradford Committee\r\n     of business men. Mr. Austen Chamberlain, Postmaster General,\r\n     states that Members from both sides of the House \"seek from\r\n     him, in his position as Postmaster General, protection for\r\n     them in the discharge of their public duties against the\r\n     pressure sought to be put upon them by employees of the Post\r\n     Office.\" He adds: \"Even if the machinery by which our Select\r\n     Committees are appointed were such as would enable us to\r\n     secure a Select Committee composed of thoroughly impartial\r\n     men who had committed themselves by no expression of opinion,\r\n     I still think that it would not be fair to pick out fifteen\r\n     Members of this House and make them marked men for the purpose\r\n     of such pressure as is now distributed more or less over the\r\n     whole Assembly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XII\r\n  THE BRADFORD COMMITTEE REPORT                                    214\r\n\r\n     The Bradford Committee ignores its reference. It recommends\r\n     measures that would cost $6,500,000 a year, in the hope of\r\n     satisfying the postal employees, who had asked for $12,500,000\r\n     a year. Lord Stanley, Postmaster General, rejects the Bradford\r\n     Committee's Report; but grants increases in wages aggregating\r\n     $1,861,500 a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XIII\r\n  THE HOUSE OF COMMONS SELECT COMMITTEE ON POST OFFICE SERVANTS,\r\n  1906                                                             226\r\n\r\n     The Post Office Civil Servants' Unions demand the adoption\r\n     of the Bradford Committee Report. Lord Stanley, Postmaster\r\n     General, applies the words \"blackmail\" and \"blood-sucking\"\r\n     to the postal employees' methods. Captain Norton moves for a\r\n     House of Commons Select Committee. Mr. Austen Chamberlain,\r\n     Chancellor of the Exchequer, in vain asks the Opposition\r\n     Party's support for a Select Committee to which shall be\r\n     referred the question of the feasibility of establishing a\r\n     permanent, non-political Commission which shall establish\r\n     general principles for settling disputes between the civil\r\n     servants and the Government of the day. Captain Norton's\r\n     Motion is lost, nine Ministerial supporters voting for it, and\r\n     only two Opposition members voting against it. Mr. J. Henniker\r\n     Heaton's appeal to the British public for \"An End to Political\r\n     Patronage.\" The Post Office employees, in the campaign\r\n     preceding the General Election of January, 1906, induce nearly\r\n     450 of the 670 parliamentary candidates who succeeded in being\r\n     elected, to pledge themselves to vote for a House of Commons\r\n     Select Committee on Post Office Wages. Immediately upon the\r\n     opening of Parliament, the Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman Liberal\r\n     Ministry gives the Post Office employees a House of Commons\r\n     Select Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XIV\r\n  THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, UNDER PRESSURE FROM THE CIVIL SERVICE UNIONS,\r\n  CURTAILS THE EXECUTIVE'S POWER TO DISMISS INCOMPETENT AND REDUNDANT\r\n  EMPLOYEES                                                        245\r\n\r\n     The old practice of intervention by Members of Parliament on\r\n     behalf of individual civil servants with political influence\r\n     has given way to the new practice of intervention on behalf\r\n     of the individual civil servant because he is a member of a\r\n     civil service union. The new practice is the more insidious\r\n     and dangerous one, for it means class bribery. The doctrine\r\n     that entrance upon the State's service means \"something very\r\n     nearly approaching to a freehold provision for life.\" Official\r\n     testimony of various prominent civil servants, especially of\r\n     Mr. (now Lord) Welby, Permanent Secretary to the Treasury\r\n     from 1885 to 1894; and Mr. T. H. Farrer, Permanent Secretary\r\n     to Board of Trade from 1867 to 1886. The costly practice of\r\n     giving pensions no solution of the problem of getting rid of\r\n     unsatisfactory public servants.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XV\r\n  THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, UNDER PRESSURE FROM THE CIVIL SERVICE UNIONS,\r\n  CURTAILS THE EXECUTIVE'S POWER TO PROMOTE EMPLOYEES ACCORDING TO\r\n  MERIT                                                            267\r\n\r\n     The civil service unions oppose promotion by merit, and\r\n     demand promotion by seniority. Testimony presented before:\r\n     Select Committee on Civil Services Expenditure, 1873; Select\r\n     Committee on Post Office, 1876; Royal Commission to inquire\r\n     into the Civil Establishments, 1888; from statement made in\r\n     House of Commons, in 1887, by Mr. Raikes, Postmaster General;\r\n     and before the so-called Tweedmouth Committee, 1897. Instances\r\n     of intervention by Members of House of Commons on behalf of\r\n     civil servants who have not been promoted, or are afraid they\r\n     shall not be promoted.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XVI\r\n  MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS INTERVENE ON BEHALF OF PUBLIC\r\n  SERVANTS WHO HAVE BEEN DISCIPLINED                               302\r\n\r\n     Evidence presented before: The Royal Commission appointed\r\n     to inquire into the Civil Establishments, 1888; and the\r\n     Tweedmouth Committee, 1897. Instances of intervention by\r\n     Members of Parliament. Mr. Austen Chamberlain, Financial\r\n     Secretary to the Treasury, in April, 1902, states that\r\n     at a low estimate one-third of the time of the highest\r\n     officials in the Post Office is occupied with petty questions\r\n     of discipline and administrative detail, because of the\r\n     intervention of Members of Parliament. He adds that it is\r\n     \"absolutely deplorable\" that time and energy that should be\r\n     given to the consideration of large questions must be given\r\n     to matters that \"in any private business would be dealt with\r\n     by the officer on the spot.\" Sir John Eldon Gorst's testimony\r\n     before the Committee on National Expenditure, 1902.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XVII\r\n  THE SPIRIT OF THE CIVIL SERVICE                                  323\r\n\r\n     The doctrine of an \"implied contract\" between the State\r\n     and each civil servant, to the effect that the State may\r\n     make no change in the manner of administering its great\r\n     trading departments without compensating every civil servant\r\n     however remotely or indirectly affected. The hours of\r\n     work may not be increased without compensating every one\r\n     affected. Administrative \"mistakes\" may not be corrected\r\n     without compensating the past beneficiaries of such\r\n     mistakes. Violation of the order that promotion must not\r\n     be mechanical, or by seniority alone, may not be corrected\r\n     without compensating those civil servants who would have\r\n     been benefitted by the continued violation of the aforesaid\r\n     order. The State may not demand increased efficiency of its\r\n     servants without compensating every one affected. Persons\r\n     filling positions for which there is no further need, must\r\n     be compensated. Each civil servant has a \"vested right\" to\r\n     the maintenance of such rate of promotion as obtains when he\r\n     enters the service, irrespective of the volume of business or\r\n     of any diminution in the number of higher posts consequent\r\n     upon administrative reforms. The telegraph clerks demand that\r\n     their chances of promotion be made as good as those of the\r\n     postal clerks proper, but they refuse to avail themselves of\r\n     the opportunity to pass over to the postal side proper of the\r\n     service, on the ground that the postal duties proper are\r\n     more irksome than the telegraph duties. Members of Parliament\r\n     support recalcitrant telegraph clerks whom the Government is\r\n     attempting to force to learn to perform postal duties, in\r\n     order that it may reap advantage from having combined the\r\n     postal service and the telegraphs in 1870. Special allowances\r\n     may not be discontinued; and vacations may not be shortened,\r\n     without safeguarding all \"vested interests.\" Further\r\n     illustrations of the hopelessly unbusinesslike spirit of the\r\n     rank and file of the public servants.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XVIII\r\n  THE HOUSE OF COMMONS STANDS FOR EXTRAVAGANCE                     360\r\n\r\n     Authoritative character of the evidence tendered by the\r\n     several Secretaries of the Treasury. Testimony, in 1902, of\r\n     Lord Welby, who had been in the Treasury from 1856 to 1894.\r\n     Testimony of Sir George H. Murray, Permanent Secretary to the\r\n     Post Office and sometime Private Secretary to the late Prime\r\n     Minister, Mr. Gladstone. Testimony of Sir Ralph H. Knox, in\r\n     the War Office since 1882. Testimony of Sir Edward Hamilton,\r\n     Assistant Secretary to the Treasury since 1894. Testimony of\r\n     Mr. R. Chalmers, a Principal Clerk in the Treasury; and of\r\n     Sir John Eldon Gorst. Mr. Gladstone's tribute to Joseph Hume,\r\n     the first and last Member of the House of Commons competent\r\n     to criticize effectively the details of expenditure of the\r\n     State. Evidence presented before the Select Committee on Civil\r\n     Services Expenditure, 1873.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XIX\r\n  CONCLUSION                                                       378\r\n\r\n\r\n  INDEX                                                            393\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BRITISH STATE TELEGRAPHS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nSCOPE OF THE INQUIRY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story of the British State Telegraphs divides itself into two\r\nparts: the purchase of the telegraphs, in 1870, from the companies\r\nthat had established the industry of telegraphy; and the subsequent\r\nconduct of the business of telegraphy by the Government. The first\r\npart is covered by Chapters II to VI; the second part by the remaining\r\nchapters. Both parts contain a record of fact and experience that\r\nshould be of service to the American public at the present moment, when\r\nthere is before them the proposal to embark upon the policy of the\r\nmunicipal ownership and operation of the so-called municipal public\r\nservice industries. The second part, however, will interest a wider\r\nbody of readers than the first part; for it deals with a question that\r\nis of profound interest and importance at all times--the problem of a\r\nlarge body of civil servants in a Democracy.\r\n\r\nChapters II to VI tell of the demand of the British Chambers of\r\nCommerce, under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce of Edinburgh,\r\nfor lower charges on telegraphic messages; the appointment by the\r\nGovernment of Mr. Scudamore, Second Secretary of the Post Office,\r\nto report upon the relative merits of private telegraphs and State\r\ntelegraphs; the character of the report submitted by Mr. Scudamore; and\r\nthe reasons why that report--upon which rested the whole argument for\r\nnationalization--was not adequately considered either by the Select\r\nCommittee of the House of Commons, to whom the Bill for the purchase\r\nof the telegraphs was referred, or by the House of Commons itself. The\r\nprincipal reason was that the agitation carried on by the Chambers of\r\nCommerce and the newspaper press[1] proved so successful that both\r\npolitical parties committed themselves to nationalization before Mr.\r\nScudamore's report had been submitted to searching criticism. Under\r\nthe circumstances, the Disraeli Ministry was unwilling to go into the\r\ngeneral election of 1868 without having made substantial progress\r\ntoward the nationalization of the telegraphs. In order to remove\r\nopposition to its Bill in the House of Commons, the Disraeli Ministry\r\nconceded practically everything asked by the telegraph companies, the\r\nrailway companies and the newspaper press.[2] The result was that the\r\nGovernment paid a high price absolutely for the telegraphs. Whether\r\nthe price was too high, relatively speaking, is difficult to say. In\r\nthe first place, the price paid--about $40,000,000--was well within\r\nthe sum which the Government had said it could afford to pay, to\r\nwit, $40,000,000 to $50,000,000. In the second place, the Government\r\nacquired an industry \"ready-made,\" with an established staff of\r\nhighly trained men educated in the school of competition--the only\r\nschool that thus far has proved itself capable of bringing out the\r\nhighest efficiency that is in men. In the second place, the Government\r\nacquired the sole right to transmit messages by electricity--a right\r\nwhich subsequent events have proved to cover all future inventions,\r\nsuch as the transmission of messages by means of the telephone and\r\nof wireless telegraphy. Finally, in spite of the wastefulness that\r\ncharacterized the Government's operation of the telegraphs from the\r\nday the telegraphs were taken over, the Telegraph Department in the\r\nyear 1880-81 became able to earn more than the interest upon the\r\nlarge capital invested in the telegraphs. But from that year on the\r\nGovernment not only became more and more wasteful, but also lost\r\ncontrol over the charges made to the public for the transmission of\r\nmessages. It is instructive to note, in this latter connection, that\r\nthe control over the rates to be charged to the public was taken out\r\nof the hands of the Government by Dr. Cameron, who represented in\r\nthe House of Commons the people of Glasgow, and that another Scotch\r\ncity, Edinburgh, had initiated and maintained the campaign for the\r\nnationalization of the telegraphs.\r\n\r\nOne of the most extraordinary of the astounding incidents of the\r\ncampaign and negotiations that resulted in the purchase of the\r\ntelegraphs, was the fact that in the debates in the House of Commons\r\nwas not even raised the question of the possibility of complications\r\nand dangers arising out of the multiplication of the civil servants.\r\nThat fact is the more remarkable, since the leaders of both political\r\nparties at the time apprehended so much danger from the existing civil\r\nservants that they refused to take active steps to enfranchise the\r\ncivil servants employed in the so-called revenue departments--the\r\ncustoms, inland revenue and Post Office departments--who had been\r\ndisfranchised since the close of the Eighteenth Century. The Bill of\r\n1868, which gave the franchise to the civil servants in question, was\r\na Private Bill, introduced by Mr. Monk, a private Member of the House\r\nof Commons; and it was carried against the protest of the Disraeli\r\nMinistry, and without the active support of the leading men in the\r\nOpposition.\r\n\r\nIn the debates upon Mr. Monk's Bill, Mr. Gladstone, sitting in\r\nOpposition, said he was not afraid that either political party ever\r\nwould try to use the votes of the civil servants for the purpose of\r\npromoting its political fortunes, \"but he owned that he had some\r\napprehension of what might be called class influence in the House of\r\nCommons, which in his opinion was the great reproach of the Reformed\r\nParliament, as he believed history would record. Whether they were\r\ngoing to emerge into a new state of things in which class influence\r\nwould be weaker, he knew not; but that class influence had been in many\r\nthings evil and a scandal to them, especially for the last fifteen or\r\ntwenty years [since the Reform of Parliament]; and he was fearful of\r\nits increase in consequence of the possession of the franchise, through\r\nthe power which men who, as members of a regular service, were already\r\norganized, might bring to bear on Members of Parliament.\"\r\n\r\nChapters VII and following show that Mr. Gladstone's apprehensions\r\nwere well-founded; that the civil servants have become a class by\r\nthemselves, with interests so widely divergent from the interests of\r\nthe rest of the community that they do not distribute their allegiance\r\nbetween the two great political parties on the merits of the respective\r\npolicies of those parties, as do an equal number of voters taken at\r\nrandom. The civil servants have organized themselves in great civil\r\nservice unions, for the purpose of promoting their class interests\r\nby bringing pressure to bear upon the House of Commons. At the\r\nparliamentary elections they tend to vote solidly for the candidate who\r\npromises them most. In one constituency they will vote for the Liberal\r\ncandidate, in another for the Conservative candidate.\r\n\r\nThus far neither Party appears to have made an open or definite\r\nalliance with the civil servants. But in the recent years in which\r\nthe Conservative Party was in power, and year after year denied--\"on\r\nprinciple\" of public policy--certain requests of the civil servants,\r\nthe rank and file, as well as some of the minor leaders of the Liberal,\r\nor Opposition Party, evinced a strong tendency to vote rather solidly\r\nin the House of Commons in support of those demands of the civil\r\nservants.[3] At the same time the chiefs of the Liberal, or Opposition\r\nParty, refrained from the debate as well as from the vote. It may be\r\nthat the Opposition Party discipline was not strong enough to enable\r\nthe Opposition chiefs to prevent the votes on the momentous issue\r\nraised in the House of Commons by the civil servants from becoming for\r\nall practical purposes Party votes; or, it may be that the Liberal\r\nParty leaders did not deem it expedient to seek to control the voting\r\nof their followers. Be that as it may, the fact remains that the\r\nConservative Ministry that was in power, repeatedly called in vain upon\r\nthe House of Commons to take out of the field of Party politics the\r\nissue raised by the civil servants in the period from 1890 to 1905.\r\nThe Conservative Ministry year after year denied the request of the\r\nPost Office employees for a House of Commons Select Committee on the\r\npay and position of the Post Office employees. On the other hand, the\r\nsupport of that request came steadily from the Liberal Opposition.\r\nIn the General Election of January, 1906, the Post Office employees\r\nthrew their weight overwhelmingly on the side of the Liberal Party;\r\nand immediately after the opening of the new Parliament, the newly\r\nestablished Liberal Government announced that it would give the Post\r\nOffice employees the House of Commons Select Committee which the late\r\nConservative Ministry had \"on principle\" of public policy refused to\r\ngrant.\r\n\r\nShortly after the General Election of January, 1906, the President\r\nof the Postal Telegraph Clerks' Association, a powerful political\r\norganization, stated that nearly 450 of the 670 Members of the House of\r\nCommons had pledged themselves, in the course of the campaign, to vote\r\nfor a House of Commons Select Committee. At about the same time, Lord\r\nBalcarres, a Conservative whip in the late Balfour ministry, speaking\r\nof the 281 members who entered Parliament for the first time in 1906,\r\nsaid \"he thought he was fairly accurate when he said that they had\r\ngiven pretty specific pledges upon this matter [of a Select Committee]\r\nto those who had sent them to the House.\" Sir Acland-Hood, chief whip\r\nin the late Balfour Ministry, added: \"... nearly the whole of the\r\nsupporters of the then [1905] Government voted against the appointment\r\nof the Select Committee [in July, 1905]. No doubt many of them suffered\r\nfor it at the general election; they either lost their seats or had\r\ntheir majorities reduced in consequence of the vote.\" And the new\r\nPrime Minister, Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman, spoke of the \"retroactive\r\neffect of old promises extracted in moments of agony from candidates\r\nat the general election.\" And finally, at the annual conference of the\r\nPostal Telegraph Clerks' Association, held in March, 1906, Mr. R. S.\r\nDavis, the representative of the Metropolitan London Telegraph Clerks,\r\nsaid: \"The new Postmaster General had made concessions which had\r\nalmost taken them [the postal clerks] off their feet by the rapidity\r\nwith which one had succeeded another and the manner in which they were\r\ngranted.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChapters XIV to XVII describe the efforts made by the civil servants\r\nto secure exemption from the ordinary vicissitudes of life, as well\r\nas exemption from the necessity of submitting to those standards of\r\nefficiency and those rules of discipline which prevail in private\r\nemployment. They show the hopelessly unbusinesslike spirit of the rank\r\nand file of the public servants, a spirit fostered by the practice of\r\nmembers of the House of Commons intervening, from the floor of the\r\nHouse as well as behind the scenes, on behalf of public servants who\r\nhave not been promoted, have been disciplined or dismissed, or, have\r\nfailed to persuade the executive officers to observe one or more of the\r\npeculiar claims of \"implied contract\" and \"vested right\" which make\r\nthe British public service so attractive to those men whose object in\r\nlife is not to secure full and untrammeled scope for their abilities\r\nand ambitions, but a haven of refuge from the ordinary vicissitudes\r\nof life. Members of the House of Commons intervene, in the manner\r\nindicated, in mere matters of detail of administration, because they\r\nhave not the courage to refuse to obey the behests of the political\r\nleaders of the civil service unions; they do not so interfere from\r\nthe mere desire to promote their political fortunes by championing\r\nthe interests of a class. They recognize the fact that the art of\r\ngovernment is the art of log-rolling, of effecting the best compromise\r\npossible, under the given conditions of political intelligence and\r\npublic spirit, between the interests of a class and the interests of\r\nthe country as a whole. Their views were forcibly expressed, on a\r\nrecent occasion, by Captain Norton, who long has been one of the most\r\naggressive champions in the House of Commons, of the civil servants,\r\nand who, at present, is a Junior Lord of the Treasury, in the Sir H.\r\nCampbell-Bannerman Liberal Ministry. Said Captain Norton: \"As regarded\r\nwhat had been said about undue influence [being exercised by the civil\r\nservants], his contention was that so long as the postal officials ...\r\nwere allowed to maintain a vote, they had precisely the same rights as\r\nall other voters in the country to exercise their fullest influence in\r\nthe defense of their rights, privileges and interests. He might mention\r\nthat all classes of all communities, of all professions, all trades,\r\nall combinations of individuals, such as anti-vaccinationists and so\r\nforth, had invariably used their utmost pressure in defense of their\r\ninterests and views upon members of the House....\"\r\n\r\nThe problem of government in every country--irrespectively of the form\r\nwhich the political institutions may take in any given country--is to\r\navoid class legislation, and to make it impossible for any one class to\r\nexploit the others. Some of us--who are old-fashioned and at present\r\nin the minority--believe that the solution of that problem is to be\r\nfound only in the upbuilding of the character and the intelligence of\r\nthe individual citizen. Others believe that it is to be found largely,\r\nif not mainly, in extending the functions of the State and the City.\r\nTo the writer, the experience of Great Britain under the experiment\r\nof the extension of the functions of the State and the City, seems\r\nto teach once more the essential soundness of the doctrine that the\r\nnation that seeks refuge from the ills that appear under the policy of\r\n_laissez-faire_, seeks refuge from such ills in the apparently easy,\r\nand therefore tempting, device of merely changing the form of its\r\npolitical institutions and political ideals, will but change the form\r\nof the ills from which it suffers.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The reason for the opposition of the newspaper press to the\r\ntelegraph companies is discussed in Chapter VIII.\r\n\r\n[2] The concession made to the newspaper press is described in Chapter\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n[3] The efforts of the civil servants culminated in the debate and vote\r\nof July 5, 1905. Upon that occasion there voted for the demands of the\r\ncivil servants eighteen Liberalists who, in 1905-6, became Members\r\nof the Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman Liberal Ministry. Two of them, Mr.\r\nHerbert Gladstone and Mr. Lloyd George, became Members of the Cabinet,\r\nor inner circle of the Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE ARGUMENT FOR THE NATIONALIZATION OF THE TELEGRAPHS\r\n\r\n     The indictment of the telegraph companies. The argument\r\n     from foreign experience. The promise of reduced tariffs\r\n     and increased facilities. The alleged financial success of\r\n     foreign State telegraphs: Belgium, Switzerland and France. The\r\n     argument from British company experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1856 the Chambers of Commerce of Great Britain, under the leadership\r\nof the Chamber of Commerce of Edinburgh, began an agitation for the\r\npurchase by the Government of the properties of the several British\r\ntelegraph companies. In 1865, the telegraph companies, acting in\r\nunison, withdrew the reduced rate of twenty-four cents for twenty\r\nwords, address free, that had been in force, since 1861, between\r\ncertain large cities. That action, which will be described further on,\r\ncaused the Chambers of Commerce to increase the agitation for State\r\npurchase. In September, 1865, Lord Stanley of Alderley, Postmaster\r\nGeneral, commissioned Mr. F. I. Scudamore, Second Secretary of the\r\nPost Office, \"to inquire and report whether, in his opinion, the\r\nelectric telegraph service might be beneficially worked by the Post\r\nOffice--whether, if so worked, it would possess any advantages over\r\na system worked by private companies--and whether it would entail\r\nany very large expenditure on the Post Office Department beyond the\r\npurchase of existing rights.\"\r\n\r\nIn July, 1866, Mr. Scudamore reported, recommending the purchase\r\nof the telegraphs. In February, 1868, he submitted a supplementary\r\nreport; and in 1868 and 1869, he acted as the chief witness for the\r\nGovernment before the Parliamentary Committees appointed to report on\r\nthe Government's Bills proposing to authorize the State to acquire\r\nand operate the telegraphs.[4] The extent to which the Government,\r\nthroughout the considerations and negotiations which finally ended in\r\nthe nationalization of the telegraphs, relied almost exclusively upon\r\nevidence supplied by Mr. Scudamore, is indicated in the statement made\r\nby the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. G. W. Hunt, on July 21, 1868,\r\nthat Mr. Scudamore \"might be said to be the author of the Bill to\r\nacquire the telegraphs.\"[5]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Indictment of the Telegraph Companies_]\r\n\r\nMr. Scudamore reported that the Chambers of Commerce, and the various\r\nwriters in the periodical and newspaper press who had supported the\r\nproposal of State purchase, had concurred in the following general\r\npropositions: \"that the charges made by the telegraph companies were\r\ntoo high, and tended to check the growth of telegraphic correspondence;\r\nthat there were frequent delays of messages; that many important\r\ndistricts were unprovided with telegraphic facilities; that in many\r\nplaces the telegraph office was inconveniently remote from the centre\r\nof business, and was open for too small a portion of the day; that\r\nlittle or no improvement could be expected so long as the working of\r\nthe telegraphs was conducted by commercial companies striving chiefly\r\nto earn a dividend and engaged in wasteful competition with each other;\r\nand, finally, that the growth of telegraphic correspondence had been\r\ngreatly stimulated in Belgium and Switzerland by the annexation of the\r\ntelegraphs to the Post Offices of those countries, and the consequent\r\nadoption of a low scale of charges; and that in Great Britain like\r\nresults would follow the adoption of like means, and that from the\r\nannexation of the British telegraphs to the British Post Office there\r\nwould accrue great advantage to the public, and ultimately a large\r\nrevenue to the State.\" Subsequently, before the Select Committees of\r\nParliament, Mr. Scudamore maintained that in the hands of the State the\r\ntelegraphs would pay from the start.\r\n\r\nMr. Scudamore continued his report with the statement that he had\r\nsatisfied himself that in Great Britain the telegraph was not in\r\nsuch general use as upon the Continent; that \"the class who used the\r\ntelegraphs most freely were stock brokers, mining agents, ship brokers,\r\nColonial brokers, racing and betting men, fruit merchants and others\r\nengaged in business of a speculative character, or who deal in articles\r\nof a perishable nature. Even general merchants used the telegraphs\r\ncomparatively little, compared with those engaged in the more\r\nspeculative branches of commerce.\" He added that from 1862 to 1868 the\r\nannual increase in the number of telegraphic messages had ranged pretty\r\nevenly from 25 per cent. to 30 per cent., indicating merely a gradual\r\nincrease in the telegraphic correspondence of those classes who had\r\nbeen the first to use the telegraphs. He said there had been none of\r\nthose \"sudden and prodigious jumps\" that had occurred on the Continent\r\nafter each reduction in the charges for telegraphic messages, or after\r\neach extension of the telegraph system to the smaller towns.\r\n\r\nMr. Scudamore held that it was a serious indictment of the manner\r\nin which the telegraph companies had discharged their duties to the\r\npublic, that the small tradesman had not learned to order goods by\r\ntelegraph, and had not thereby enabled himself to get along with a\r\nsmaller stock of goods kept constantly on hand; that the fishing\r\nvillages on the remote coasts of Scotland that had no railways, had no\r\ntelegraphs; that the public did not send \"millions of messages\" of this\r\nkind: \"I shall not be home to dinner;\" \"I will bring down some fish;\"\r\n\"You can meet me at four;\" and that the wife and children, away from\r\ntheir home in the country village, did not telegraph to the husband and\r\nfather: \"Send me a money order.\" Mr. Scudamore's notions of the uses to\r\nwhich the telegraphs ought to be put were shared by the Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer, Mr. Hunt, who looked forward to the day when \"persons\r\nwho have a difficulty in writing letters will have less difficulty in\r\ngoing to a telegraph office and sending a message to a friend than\r\nwriting a letter.\"[6]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Argument from Foreign Experience_]\r\n\r\nMr. Scudamore supported his position with the subjoined reports from\r\ncountries in which the State operated the telegraphs. The Danish\r\nGovernment had reported that the telegraph was used by merchants\r\ngenerally and for social and domestic purposes. Prussia had reported\r\nthat in the early days, when the charges had been high, the use of the\r\ntelegraph had been confined almost exclusively to bankers, brokers,\r\nlarge commercial houses and newspaper correspondents, but that with\r\neach reduction in the charges, or extension of the telegraphs to small\r\ntowns, the number of those who regularly sent out and received messages\r\nhad increased considerably. Switzerland had reported that messages\r\nrelating to personal business and family affairs formed as important\r\na part of the whole traffic as the messages of banking interests and\r\nother trading interests.\r\n\r\nFrance had reported that 38 per cent. of the messages related to\r\npersonal business and family affairs; and Belgium had reported that\r\nnearly 59 per cent. of the messages related to personal business and\r\nfamily affairs.\r\n\r\nTo indicate the manner in which the use of the telegraph increased\r\nwith reductions in the charges made, Mr. Scudamore reported that in\r\nBelgium, in 1863, a reduction of 33 per cent. in the charge had been\r\nfollowed by an increase of 80 per cent. in the number of telegrams;\r\nand that, in 1866, a reduction of 50 per cent. in the charges had been\r\nfollowed by an increase of 85 per cent. in the traffic. In France, in\r\n1862, a reduction of 35 per cent. in the charge, had led to an increase\r\nof 64 per cent. in the number of messages. In Switzerland, in 1868, a\r\nreduction of 50 per cent. in the charge had been followed, in the next\r\nthree months, by an increase in business of 90 per cent. In Prussia,\r\nin 1867, a reduction of the charge by 33 per cent. had, in the first\r\nmonth, increased the number of messages by 70 per cent. The increase in\r\nbusiness always had followed immediately, said Mr. Scudamore, showing\r\nthat new classes of people took up the use of the telegraphs.\r\n\r\nFinally, Mr. Scudamore stated that in 1866, the proportion borne by the\r\ntotal of telegrams sent to the aggregate of letters sent, had been:\r\nin Belgium, one telegram for every 37 letters; in Switzerland, one\r\ntelegram for every 69 letters; and in the United Kingdom, one telegram\r\nfor every 121 letters. The relative failure of the people of the United\r\nKingdom to use the telegraph freely, Mr. Scudamore ascribed to the\r\nhigh charges made by the telegraph companies, and to the restricted\r\nfacilities offered by the companies.\r\n\r\nIn 1868, the British companies were charging 24 cents for a twenty-word\r\nmessage, over distances not exceeding 100 miles; 36 cents for distances\r\nbetween 100 and 200 miles; and 48 cents for distances exceeding 200\r\nmiles. For messages passing between Great Britain and Ireland, the\r\ncharge ranged from $0.72 to $1.44. In all cases the addresses of the\r\nsender and of the sendee were carried free.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Promise of Lower Charges and Better Service_]\r\n\r\nThe Government proposed to make a uniform charge of 24 cents for twenty\r\nwords, irrespective of distance. Mr. Scudamore stated that he fully\r\nexpected that in two or three years the Government would reduce its\r\ncharge to 12 cents. The only reason why the Government did not propose\r\nto adopt immediately the last mentioned rate, was the desire not to\r\novercrowd the telegraphs at the start before there had been the chance\r\nto learn with what volume of traffic the existing plant and staff could\r\ncope.[7]\r\n\r\nIn 1868 there was in the United Kingdom one telegraph office for\r\nevery 13,000 people. The Government promised to inaugurate the\r\nnationalization of the telegraphs by giving one office for every 6,000\r\npeople.[8]\r\n\r\nIn the shortest time possible, the Government would open a telegraph\r\noffice at every money order issuing Post Office. At that time the\r\npractice was to establish a money order office wherever there was the\r\nprospect of two money orders being issued a day; and in some instances\r\nsuch offices were established on the prospect of one order a day.\r\n\r\nThe contention that the public interest demanded a great increase in\r\nthe number of telegraph offices, Mr. Scudamore supported by citing\r\nthe number of offices in Belgium and France. In the former country\r\nthere were upward of 125 telegraph offices which despatched less than\r\none telegram a day. In fact, some offices despatched less than one a\r\nmonth. The Belgium Government, in figuring the cost of the Telegraph\r\nDepartment, charged that Department nothing whatever for office rent,\r\nor for fire, light and office fittings; nor did it charge the smaller\r\noffices anything for the time given by the State Railway employees and\r\nthe postal employees to the Telegraph Department. In France there were\r\n301 telegraph offices that took in less than $40 a year; 179 offices\r\nthat took in from $40 to $100; and 185 offices that took in from $100\r\nto $200.\r\n\r\nMr. Scudamore over and again assured the Parliamentary Select\r\nCommittee of 1868 that the telegraphs in the hands of the State would\r\nbe self-supporting from the start, and that ultimately they would be\r\na considerable source of revenue. But he supported his indictment\r\nof the telegraph companies of the United Kingdom by drawing upon\r\nthe experience of the State telegraphs of Belgium, Switzerland, and\r\nFrance, under very low rates on inland telegrams, as distinguished\r\nfrom telegrams in transit, or telegrams to and from foreign countries.\r\nIn taking that course, Mr. Scudamore ignored the fact that the inland\r\nrates in question were not remunerative.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Belgium's Experience_]\r\n\r\nThe Belgium State telegraphs had been opened in 1850. In the years\r\n1850 to 1856, they had earned, upon an average, 36.8 per cent. a year\r\nupon their cost. In the period 1857 to 1862, they had earned, upon an\r\naverage, 24.3 per cent. In 1863 to 1865, the annual earnings fell to an\r\naverage of 13.5 per cent.; and in 1866 to 1869, they reached an average\r\nof 2.8 per cent. only. The reasons for that rapid and steady decline of\r\nthe net earnings were: the opening of relatively unprofitable lines and\r\noffices; increases in wages which the Government could not withhold;\r\na slackening in the rate of growth of the profits on the so-called\r\nforeign messages and transit messages; and a rapid increase in the\r\nlosses upon the inland messages, which were carried at low rates for\r\nthe purpose of stimulating traffic.\r\n\r\nAt an early date the Belgium Government concluded that the first three\r\nof the four factors just enumerated were beyond the control of the\r\nState, and therefore permanent. It resolved, therefore, to attempt to\r\nneutralize them by developing the inland traffic to such proportions\r\nthat it should become a source of profit, that traffic having been, up\r\nto that time, a source of loss. Accordingly, on January 1st, 1863, the\r\nGovernment lowered the charge on inland messages from 30 cents for 20\r\nwords, addresses included, to 20 cents. As that reduction did not prove\r\nsufficiently effective, the charge on inland messages was reduced, on\r\nDecember 1st, 1865, to 10 cents for 20 words. Under that reduction the\r\nloss incurred upon the inland messages rose from an annual average of\r\n$13,800 in 1863 to 1865, to an annual average of $59,500 in 1866 to\r\n1869; and the average annual return upon the capital invested fell to\r\n2.8 per cent. This evidence was before Mr. Scudamore when he argued\r\nfrom the experience of Belgium in favor of a uniform rate, irrespective\r\nof distance, of 24 cents for 20 words, not counting the addresses. Mr.\r\nScudamore shared the opinion of the Belgium Government that the rate of\r\n10 cents would so stimulate the traffic as to become very profitable.\r\nAs a matter of fact, things went from bad to worse in Belgium, and\r\nfor many years the Belgian State telegraphs failed to earn operating\r\nexpenses.[9]\r\n\r\nBy way of explanation it should be added that the so-called transit\r\nmessages and foreign messages were profitable for two reasons. In\r\nthe first place, the Belgian Government kept high the rates on those\r\nmessages. In the second place, those messages are carried much more\r\ncheaply than inland messages. The transit messages, say from Germany\r\nto England, have only to be retransmitted; they are not received\r\nacross the counter, nor are they delivered across the counter and by\r\nmessenger. The foreign messages are burdened with only one of the two\r\nforegoing relatively costly operations. In 1866 the Belgian Government\r\nstated that, if the cost to the Telegraph Department of a given number\r\nof words transmitted as a message in transit be represented by two, the\r\ncorresponding cost of the same number of words received and transmitted\r\nas a foreign message would be represented by three, while the cost of\r\nthe same number of words received and transmitted as an inland message\r\nwould be represented by five.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Swiss Experience_]\r\n\r\nThe Swiss State telegraphs, the experience of which Mr. Scudamore also\r\ncited in support of his Report, were opened in 1852; and in the period\r\nfrom 1854 to 1866 they earned, on an average, 18 per cent. upon their\r\ncost. Throughout that period the average receipts per inland messages\r\nwere 21 cents, and the average receipts per foreign message were 39\r\ncents. In the year 1865 the average receipts per message were 21 cents\r\nfor inland messages, and 30 cents for foreign and transit messages,\r\nwhich constituted 39 per cent. of the traffic. In the following year,\r\n1866, the average receipts upon the inland traffic remained unchanged;\r\nwhile those upon the foreign and transit traffic, 43 per cent. of the\r\ntotal traffic, fell to 20 cents. This reduction of 33 per cent. in the\r\naverage receipts upon the foreign and transit traffic, caused a decline\r\nof 45 per cent. in the total net receipts, and reduced the earnings\r\nupon the capital from 15.2 per cent. in 1865, to 7.5 per cent. in 1866.\r\n\r\nThus far the receipts from the inland messages had not covered the\r\noperating expenses incurred on account of those messages. The profits,\r\nwhich had been very large, had come from the foreign messages and\r\nmessages in transit.[10] The Government, alarmed at the decline in\r\nprofits resulting from the fall in the average receipts per message\r\nin the foreign and transit traffic, resolved upon a special effort to\r\nstimulate the growth of the inland traffic. Accordingly, on January\r\n1st, 1868, it lowered the rates on inland messages of 20 words, address\r\ncounted, from 20 cents to 10 cents. The inland traffic immediately\r\ndoubled; but the cost of handling it more than doubled. The increase\r\nin the traffic necessitated the stringing of additional wires, and\r\nthe employment of more instruments, linemen, telegraphers and office\r\nclerks. At the same time the Government was obliged to concede all\r\nround increases of wages and salaries, in consequence of the general\r\nincrease in the cost of living which accompanied the world-wide\r\nrevival of trade ushered in by the discovery of gold in California and\r\nAustralia, the introduction of steamships upon the high seas, and the\r\nbuilding of railways in all parts of the world.\r\n\r\nThe inland messages increased by leaps and bounds from 397,289 in 1867\r\nto 2,118,373 in 1876; and still the receipts from them did not cover\r\nthe operating expenses. In 1874 and 1875, for example, those expenses\r\naveraged 14 cents per message. Accordingly, in 1877, the Government\r\nadopted a new scale of charges on inland messages, to wit: an initial\r\ncharge of 6 cents per message, to which was added 0.5 cent for every\r\nword transmitted. The Government assumed that the average length of the\r\ninland messages would be 14 words; and that the average receipts per\r\nmessage would be 13 cents. It hoped soon to reduce the average cost\r\nper message below 13 cents, and hoped thus to make the inland traffic\r\nremunerative. But those expectations never were realized; and to this\r\nday the inland messages have been carried at a loss.[11]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _French Experience_]\r\n\r\nIn 1861, the French State telegraphs reduced the rate for messages of\r\n20 words, counting the address, to 20 cents for intradepartmental[12]\r\nmessages, and to 40 cents for interdepartmental messages. In 1866 the\r\naverage receipts per message were: 38 cents on the inland traffic;\r\n$1.38 on the foreign traffic; and 55.8 cents on the traffic as a whole.\r\nWith these average receipts per message, the earnings were $1,541,519;\r\nwhile the operating expenses were $1,796,692. In other words, the State\r\ntelegraphs lost $255,173 on the working, besides failing to earn any\r\ninterest on the capital invested in them, $4,760,000.\r\n\r\nIn making the foregoing statement, no allowance is made for the value\r\nof the messages sent \"on public service,\" messages for which the\r\nState would have been obliged to pay, had the telegraphs been owned\r\nor operated by companies. No such allowance can be made, because the\r\nseveral official French statements submitted by Mr. Scudamore as to\r\nthe number of messages sent \"on public service\" applied to the years\r\n1865 and 1867, years for which the operating expenses were not given.\r\nFurthermore, the messages sent on public service in 1865 and 1867 were\r\nso numerous as to indicate so loose a construction of the term \"on\r\npublic service\" as to make the returns worthless for the purpose of\r\ndetermining the commercial value of the saving resulting to the State\r\nfrom the public ownership of the telegraphs. For 1865, the number of\r\nmessages \"on public service\" was returned as 568,647, the equivalent of\r\n23 per cent. of the number of messages sent by the public. For 1867,\r\nthe number was returned as 168,999, the equivalent of 5.94 per cent.\r\nof the messages sent by the public. That those figures represented\r\nan unreasonable resource to the telegraph for the transaction of the\r\nState's business, is proved by the fact that in the United Kingdom,\r\nin the period 1871 to 1890, the value of the messages sent \"on public\r\nservice\" was equivalent to less than 2 per cent. of the sums paid\r\nby the public for the transmission of telegraphic messages. On the\r\nbasis of any reasonable use of the telegraphs \"on public service,\"\r\nthe financial results of the French State telegraphs would not have\r\nbeen altered materially. The deficit, in 1866, on account of operating\r\nexpenses, $255,173, was sufficient to permit of the sending of 457,300\r\nmessages \"on public service,\" the equivalent of 16 per cent. of the\r\nmessages sent by the public. It would be unreasonable to assume that\r\nthe State could have need of such recourse to the telegraphs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Summary of Foreign Experience_]\r\n\r\nTo sum up the evidence from Belgium, Switzerland, and France,\r\nsubmitted by Mr. Scudamore in 1866 to 1869: This evidence was that\r\nrates of 20 cents and 10 cents for 20 words, applied to inland\r\nmessages, developed an enormous inland traffic, but that that traffic\r\nwas unremunerative. So long as the rates on foreign messages and\r\ntransit messages had remained very much higher than the rates on inland\r\nmessages, the Belgian and Swiss State telegraphs had paid handsomely.\r\nBut as soon as the latter rates had approached the level of the former\r\nrates, the net revenue had tumbled headlong; and there was, in 1868 and\r\n1869, no certainty that it would not disappear entirely, or be reduced\r\nto such proportions as no longer to afford an adequate return upon the\r\ncapital invested in the telegraphs. In the case of France, no evidence\r\nwas presented that the State telegraphs ever had paid their way, though\r\nthe prices obtained for the transmission of foreign messages and\r\ntransit messages were between three and four times the returns obtained\r\nfrom the transmission of inland messages.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _English Companies' Experience_]\r\n\r\nWhile the evidence from Belgium, Switzerland and France, presented by\r\nMr. Scudamore, did not support the proposition of a low uniform rate,\r\nirrespective of distance, the evidence furnished by the experience of\r\nthe telegraph companies of the United Kingdom pointed strongly to the\r\nconclusion that a uniform rate, irrespective of distance, of 24 cents\r\nfor 20 words, addresses not counted, was not remunerative in the then\r\nstate of efficiency of the telegraph. In this connection it must be\r\nborne in mind that at this time messages had to be retransmitted at\r\nintervals of 200 or 300 miles; and that, while the maximum distance a\r\nmessage could travel was only 160 miles in Belgium, and 200 miles in\r\nSwitzerland, it was 600 miles in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nIn 1861 the telegraph business of the United Kingdom was in the\r\nhands of two companies which had been organized in 1846 and 1852\r\nrespectively: the Electric and International Telegraph Company, and the\r\nBritish and Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company. In that year, 1861, a new\r\ncompany, the United Kingdom Electric Telegraph Company, invaded the\r\nfield with a uniform tariff, irrespective of distance, of 24 cents for\r\n20 words, addresses free. The established companies had been charging\r\n24 cents for distances up to 25 miles; 36 cents for distances up to 50\r\nmiles; 48 cents for distances up to 100 miles; 60 cents for distances\r\nup to 200 miles; 96 cents for distances up to 300 miles; and $1.20 for\r\ndistances up to 400 miles.[13]\r\n\r\nThe United Kingdom Company began operations in 1861 with a trunk line\r\nbetween London, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and intermediate and\r\nneighboring towns. Shortly afterward it opened a second trunk line from\r\nLondon to Northampton, Leicester, Nottingham, Sheffield, Barnsley,\r\nWakefield, Leeds and Hull; and across through Bradford, Halifax,\r\nRochdale, and Huddersfield to Manchester and Liverpool. Subsequently\r\nthe company extended its line to Edinburgh and Glasgow, thus\r\nlengthening to upward of 500 miles, the distance over which messages\r\nwere transmitted for 24 cents.[14]\r\n\r\nIn July 1865, the Board of Directors reported as follows to the\r\nstockholders: \"The Directors much regret to state that, notwithstanding\r\ntheir earnest efforts to develop telegraphic communication so as to\r\nrender the shilling [24 cent] rate remunerative, the company has been\r\nunable to earn a dividend. The system of the company consists of\r\ntrunk lines almost exclusively embracing nearly all the main centres\r\nof business, telegraphically speaking, of the country. Seeing that\r\nthe company was working under the greatest possible advantages, and\r\nthat upward of four years had elapsed since the formation of the\r\ncompany without the payment of any dividend to the proprietary, the\r\ndirectors conceived that they would not be justified in continuing the\r\nshilling [24 cent] system, and arrangements were therefore agreed to\r\nfor its alteration. The directors waited until the last moment before\r\nreluctantly adopting this step, but having sought publicity in every\r\nway, having persistently canvassed in every department of business, and\r\nhaving endeavored by personal solicitations of numerous active agents\r\nto attract trade, they at last saw themselves compelled to agree to a\r\nmeasure that was greatly antagonistic to their personal wishes, but\r\nabsolutely essential for the well-being of the company, and requisite,\r\nas they believe, for the permanent interests of the telegraphing\r\ncommunity.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1865, the United Kingdom Telegraph Company joined with its\r\ncompetitors, the Electric and International Telegraph Company, and the\r\nBritish and Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company, in the following rates\r\nfor 20 words, addresses free: 24 cents for distances up to 100 miles;\r\n36 cents for distances between 100 and 200 miles; and 48 cents for\r\ndistances beyond 200 miles.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1866, the directors of the United Kingdom Telegraph Company\r\nreported that in the last half-year \"the company earned an amount\r\nof profit equal to 6 per cent. dividend over the whole of its share\r\ncapital.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the United Kingdom Company had entered the field, in 1861, with\r\nthe 24 cent rate, the old established companies, the Electric and\r\nInternational and the British and Irish Magnetic, had been compelled\r\nto adopt the 24 cent rate between all points reached by the United\r\nKingdom Company. In February, 1863, the directors of the Electric and\r\nInternational Company reported that the 24 cent circuit between London,\r\nLiverpool, Manchester and Birmingham still was unremunerative. The\r\ncompany was losing money on every message transmitted, though the 24\r\ncent rate had increased business to such an extent that the company\r\nhad been obliged to add two wires to the circuit in question. Since\r\nthe business done by means of the additional wires did not pay, the\r\ndirectors had charged the cost of those wires to operating expenses,\r\nnot to capital account. The company did not care for the business, but\r\ncould not refuse to take it. In July, 1865, the directors reported:\r\n\"After a trial of four years, the experiment of a uniform shilling\r\nrate [on certain circuits] irrespective of distance, has not justified\r\nitself.\"\r\n\r\nThe half yearly reports of the British and Irish Magnetic Company from\r\n1862 to 1865 reported that \"for any but very short distances,\" the 24\r\ncent tariff was \"utterly unremunerative.\" The effect of the rate was to\r\nabsorb in unavoidable additional expenses a very large portion of the\r\nincrease in revenue coming from the increase in business.\r\n\r\nIn 1859 the London District Telegraph Company was organized for\r\nthe purpose of transmitting telegraph messages between points in\r\nMetropolitan London. In 1860 the company had 52 stations and 73.5 miles\r\nof line; and it carried 74,582 messages. In 1862 it had 84 offices and\r\n103 miles of line, and it carried 243,849 messages. In 1865 the company\r\nreached its highest point, carrying 316,272 messages. The company at\r\nthat time had 123 miles of line and 83 offices. The London District\r\nTelegraph Company began with a tariff of 8 cents for 10 words, and 12\r\ncents for a message of 10 words with a reply message of 10 words. It\r\nsoon changed its tariff to 12 cents for 15 words, experience having\r\nshown that 10 words was an insufficient allowance.[15] Subsequently the\r\ncompany added porterage charges for delivery beyond a certain distance.\r\nIn 1866, the company raised its tariff to 24 cents. The company never\r\nearned operating expenses; and in November, 1867, its shares, upon\r\nwhich $25 had been paid in, fluctuated between $3.75 and $6.25.[16]\r\n\r\nMr. Robert Grimston, Chairman of the Electric and International\r\nTelegraph Company, in 1868 commented as follows upon the experience\r\nof the London District Telegraph Company. \"A very strong argument\r\nagainst the popular fancy that the introduction of a low rate of charge\r\nin towns and country districts would induce the shopkeepers and the\r\nlower classes to use the telegraph is furnished by the example of the\r\nLondon District Telegraph Company. A better or a wider field than\r\nthe metropolitan for an illustration of this theory could not surely\r\nbe furnished. The facts, however, being, that after several years of\r\nstruggling existence, the tariff being first fixed at 8 cents, and then\r\nat 12 cents, the company has never paid its way.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] _A Report to the Postmaster General upon Certain Proposals which\r\nhave been made for transferring to the Post Office the Control and\r\nManagement of the Electric Telegraphs throughout the United Kingdom,\r\nJuly, 1868_;

The adequacy of\r\n     private enterprise. Mr. Scudamore's loose use of statistics.\r\n     Mr. Scudamore's test of adequacy of facilities. Telegraphic\r\n     charges and growth of traffic in Great Britain. The alleged\r\n     wastefulness of competition. The telegraph companies' proposal.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon the foregoing evidence, taken from the experience of the State\r\ntelegraphs of Belgium, Switzerland, and France, and from the experience\r\nof the telegraph companies of the United Kingdom, Mr. Scudamore reached\r\nthe conclusion that in telegraphy, in the United Kingdom, private\r\nenterprise had broken down. He stated his conclusion in these words:\r\n\"It is clearly shown, I think, ... that the cardinal distinction\r\nbetween the telegraph system of the United Kingdom and the systems\r\nof Belgium and Switzerland is this: that the latter have been framed\r\nand maintained solely with a view to the accommodation of the public,\r\nwhilst the former has been devised and maintained mainly with a view to\r\nthe interests of shareholders, and only indirectly for the benefit of\r\nthe public.\" These words were intended to convey, and they did convey,\r\nthe meaning that the policy of _laissez-faire_ had broken down. That\r\npolicy rests on the assumption that in the long run, and upon the\r\nwhole, the public interest is conserved and promoted by the activities\r\nof the individual citizens who are seeking to promote their personal\r\nfortunes--by the activities of \"the mere speculator and dividend\r\nseeker\"--to employ the phrase that came into common use in 1866 to\r\n1869, and ever since, has been made to do yeoman service.\r\n\r\nLet us test by the evidence--of which a large part is to be found\r\ntucked away in the appendices to Mr. Scudamore's reports--this\r\nconclusion that in telegraphy, in the United Kingdom, private\r\nenterprise had broken down, and the policy of _laissez-faire_ had been\r\ndiscredited.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to note in this connection is, that in the case of\r\ntelegraphy, as in the case of so many other British industries, public\r\nownership has been a parasite. It has been unwilling to assume the risk\r\nand burden of establishing the industry, and has contented itself with\r\npurchasing \"ready-made\" the industry after it had been developed by\r\nprivate enterprise. When Mr. Ronalds attempted to interest the British\r\nGovernment in telegraphy, he was told \"that the telegraph was of no use\r\nin times of peace, and that the semaphore in time of war answered all\r\nthe required purposes.\"[17]\r\n\r\nIn 1837, British individuals and companies began to stake their money\r\nupon the telegraph in Great Britain; and in 1854 they even carried the\r\ntelegraph industry to continental Europe, notably to Belgium. In 1850\r\nand 1851, the Governments of France, Belgium and Switzerland, profiting\r\nby the losses suffered, and the technical advances made, by British\r\nindividuals and companies, appropriated, so far as their countries were\r\nconcerned, the new industry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _History of British Telegraphy_]\r\n\r\nThe Electric and International Telegraph Company was formed in 1846,\r\nout of the reorganization of properties, that in 1837 had embarked in\r\ntelegraphy in England, and in 1845 had carried the telegraph industry\r\nto Belgium.[18] At this time the use of the telegraph was confined\r\nalmost exclusively to railway purposes, such as train signalling. The\r\npossibility of use for commercial purposes was so little appreciated\r\nby the public, that the Electric and International Company, after\r\npurchasing, in 1846, Messrs. Cooke and Wheatstone's inventions, was\r\nlooked upon as a complete commercial failure. The shares of the\r\ncompany for several years were almost valueless; the chief source of\r\nrevenue then being contracts obtained from railway companies for the\r\nconstruction and maintenance of railway telegraphs.\r\n\r\nBetween 1846 and 1851 great improvements were made in telegraphy, and\r\nthe public gradually learned to use the telegraph. In 1849 the Electric\r\nand International declared its first dividend, mainly the result of\r\nthe contracts with the railway companies. In November, 1851, a cable\r\nwas laid between Dover and Calais; for the first time the prices of\r\nthe stock exchange securities in Paris were known the same day within\r\nbusiness hours on the London stock exchange; and the financial and\r\ntrading interests became convinced of the value of the telegraph.[19]\r\n\r\nThe Electric and International Company began in 1846 with a capital,\r\npaid in, of $700,000, which had been increased, by the close of 1868,\r\nto $5,849,375. The company grew steadily, and in 1867 it had 10,000\r\nmiles of line, and 49,600 miles of wire. In March, 1856, when the\r\ncompany had a record of five years for dividends ranging from 6 to\r\n6.5 per cent. on the capital paid in, the stock of the company was\r\nselling at 80, which showed that the investing public deemed the\r\nreturns inadequate, considering the risks attaching to the business. In\r\nJanuary, 1863, when the company had a record of three years as a 7 per\r\ncent. company, the stock still stood under par--at 99.5. In 1864 the\r\ncompany paid 8 per cent., in 1865 it paid 9 per cent., and in 1866 to\r\n1868 it paid 10 per cent.[20]\r\n\r\nThe British and Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company was formed in 1857\r\nby amalgamation of the Magnetic Telegraph Company, organized in 1851,\r\nand the British Telegraph Company, organized in 1852. In March, 1856,\r\nthe Magnetic had a paid up capital of $1,500,000, which was worth 60\r\ncents on the dollar; and the British Company had a paid up capital of\r\n$1,170,000, which was worth 47.5 cents on the dollar. In January, 1864,\r\nthe amalgamated company was paying 4.5 per cent., and its shares were\r\nworth 62.5. In 1865 the British and Irish raised the dividend to 5 per\r\ncent.; in 1866 to 6 per cent., and in 1867 to 7.5 per cent. In 1866 the\r\nstock sold at 78 to 90; and in 1867 at 90 to 97. In 1867 the company\r\nhad 4,696 miles of line, and 18,964 miles of wire.\r\n\r\nThe United Kingdom Telegraph Company was organized in 1860, and began\r\noperations in 1861. In November, 1867, its shares were worth from 25\r\ncents to 35 cents on the dollar. At that time the company had 1,692\r\nmiles of line, and about 9,827 miles of wire.\r\n\r\nThe London District Telegraph Company, which subsequently became the\r\nLondon and Provincial, began business in 1860 with 52 offices in\r\nMetropolitan London. In 1862 it increased the number of its offices to\r\n84; and at the time of its sale to the State, it had 95 offices. The\r\ncompany never earned operating expenses. It began by charging 8 cents\r\nfor 10 words; later on it charged 12 cents for 15 words; and in 1866 it\r\nraised its charge to 24 cents.\r\n\r\nVery little new capital was invested by the telegraph companies after\r\n1865, because of \"the very natural reluctance of the companies to\r\nextend the systems under their control so long as the proposal of the\r\nacquisition of those systems by the State was under consideration,\" to\r\nuse the words of Mr. Scudamore.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Adequate Results of Private Enterprise_]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing facts show that private enterprise was ready throughout\r\nthe period beginning with 1838 to incur considerable risks in\r\nestablishing the new industry of telegraphy, and in giving to the\r\npublic facilities for the use of that industry. Private enterprise\r\ndid not at any time adopt the policy of exploiting the public by\r\nconfining itself to operations involving little or no risk, while\r\npaying well. It is true that once a company had reached the position\r\nof paying 5, 6, 7, 8, or more, per cent., it tried to maintain that\r\nposition, and refrained from making extensions at such a rate as to\r\ncause a decrease in the dividend. But that fact does not warrant the\r\ncharge that the companies neglected their duty to the public. Until the\r\nthreat of purchase by the State arrested extensions, and the dividends\r\nrose unusually rapidly, the earnings of the companies were moderate;\r\nand finally, though the companies tried to maintain whatever rate of\r\ndividend had once been attained, the investing public never believed\r\nthat even the Electric and International would maintain indefinitely\r\nthe 10 per cent. rate. That is shown by the fact that until the public\r\nbegan to speculate on the strength of the prospect of the State paying\r\na big price for the property of the Electric and International, the\r\nstock of that company never sold for more than 14 years' purchase.[21]\r\nHad the public believed that the 10 per cent. dividend would be\r\nmaintained indefinitely, the stock would have risen to 25 years'\r\npurchase, the price of the best railway shares.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Mr. Scudamore's Statistics_]\r\n\r\nIn order to show that the people of the United Kingdom suffered from\r\na lack of telegraphic facilities, when compared with the people of\r\nBelgium and Switzerland, Mr. Scudamore stated in his reports of 1865\r\nand 1866, that there were: in Belgium, 17.75 miles of telegraph line\r\nto every 100 square miles; in Switzerland, 13.7; and in the United\r\nKingdom, 11.3. He stated, also, that there were in Belgium 6.33\r\ntelegraph offices to every 100,000 people; in Switzerland, 9.9; and in\r\nthe United Kingdom, 5.6.\r\n\r\nMr. Scudamore obtained the figures with regard to the United Kingdom\r\nfrom the Board of Trade returns.[22] For 1865 to 1867, those returns\r\nwere very incomplete; but in 1868 they became very full. Mr.\r\nScudamore's reports of 1865 and 1868 were not ordered, by the House of\r\nCommons, to be printed, until April, 1868, when the completed Board of\r\nTrade returns were available. But neither in the reports as laid before\r\nParliament, nor in the testimony given before the Select Committee of\r\nParliament in 1868, did Mr. Scudamore draw attention to the fact that\r\nthe statement that the United Kingdom had only 11.3 miles of telegraph\r\nline to every 100 square miles of area, and 5.6 telegraph offices to\r\nevery 100,000 people, was based on incomplete returns.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Trade return for 1868 stated that the Lancashire and\r\nYorkshire Railway Company had 432 miles of telegraph lines and that\r\nvarious other companies not enumerated in 1865, had, in 1868, 3,665\r\nmiles of line. If it be assumed that in the period from 1865 to 1868\r\nthe Lancashire and the other railway companies not enumerated in 1865,\r\nincreased their net at the same rate as did the three railway companies\r\nthat were enumerated in 1865, namely, 11 per cent., there must have\r\nbeen, in 1865, not less than 3,825 miles of telegraph line of which Mr.\r\nScudamore took no account in fixing the total mileage at 16,066 miles.\r\nIf it be further assumed that one-third of the 3,825 miles in question\r\nparalleled telegraph lines of the telegraph companies, there were\r\nleft out of account in 1865 by Mr. Scudamore 2,550 miles of telegraph\r\nline, the equivalent of 2.1 miles per 100 square miles of area. On the\r\nforegoing assumptions the mileage that should have been assigned to the\r\nUnited Kingdom in 1865 was not 11.3, but 13.4.\r\n\r\nConsiderations similar to the foregoing ones, when applied to Mr.\r\nScudamore's statement that there were, in 1865, 2,040 telegraph\r\nstations, show that there probably were 2,680 telegraph stations in\r\n1865, a full allowance being made for duplication. The last named\r\nfigure would have been equivalent to 8.9 telegraph offices for every\r\n100,000 people as against 5.6 reported by Mr. Scudamore.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing corrections probably err in the direction of understating\r\nthe telegraph facilities existent in the United Kingdom in 1865. These\r\ncorrected results show that in the matter of telegraph line per 100\r\nsquare miles of area, the United Kingdom was abreast of Switzerland\r\nin 1865, though considerably behind Belgium; and that, in the matter\r\nof telegraph offices per 100,000 people, it was almost abreast of\r\nSwitzerland, and considerably in advance of Belgium.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is helpful to note that in 1875, after the\r\nBritish Government had spent about $12,500,000 in rearranging and\r\nextending the telegraph lines, as against Mr. Scudamore's estimate\r\nof 1868 that $1,500,000 would suffice for all rearrangements and\r\nextensions, the number of miles of telegraph line per 100 square miles\r\nof area was, 20 in the United Kingdom, and 27.4 in Belgium.[23]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Mr. Scudamore's Standards of Service_]\r\n\r\nMr. Scudamore submitted several other arguments in support of the\r\nstatement that private enterprise had failed to provide the public with\r\nsufficient telegraphic facilities. He submitted a list of 486 English\r\nand Welsh towns, ranging in population from 2,000 to 200,000, and\r\nstated in each case whether or not the town was a telegraph station;\r\nand if it was one, whether the telegraph office was, or was not, within\r\nthe town limits. Mr. Scudamore summarized the facts elucidated, with\r\nthe statement that 30 per cent. of the 486 towns were well served; that\r\n40 per cent. were indifferently served; that 12 per cent. were badly\r\nserved; that 18 per cent. were not served at all; and that the towns\r\nnot served at all had an aggregate population of more than 500,000.[24]\r\n\r\nMr. Scudamore did not define his standards of good service,\r\nindifferent service, bad service, and absence of service; but\r\nexamination of his data shows that his standards were so rigorous that\r\nthe state of affairs revealed in his summary was by no means so bad\r\nas might appear at first sight. Mr. Scudamore took as the standard\r\nof good service, the presence of a telegraph office within the town\r\nlimits. He characterized as indifferent the service of 98 towns in\r\nwhich the telegraph office was within one-quarter of a mile of the\r\nPost Office, though outside of the town limits; as well as the service\r\nof 88 towns in which the telegraph office was within one-half a mile\r\nof the Post Office, though outside of the town limits. He called the\r\nservice bad in the case of 38 towns in which the telegraph office was\r\nwithin three-quarters of a mile of the Post Office; as well as in the\r\ncase of 22 towns in which the telegraph office was one mile from the\r\nPost Office. He said there was no service whenever the distance of\r\nthe telegraph office from the Post Office exceeded one mile. In this\r\nconnection it should be added that the telegraph lines followed the\r\nrailway; and that in consequence of the prejudice against railway\r\ncompanies in the early days, very many cities and towns refused to\r\nallow the railway to enter the city or town limits.\r\n\r\nMr. Scudamore's data showed that there had been in 1865 not less than\r\n96 towns in which the distance between the Post Office and the nearest\r\ntelegraph office exceeded one mile. In a foot-note, in the appendix,\r\nMr. Scudamore stated that in 1868, not less than 25 of the 96 towns\r\nhad been given a railway telegraph office; but no mention of that\r\nfact did he make in the main body of the report, the only part of the\r\ndocument likely to be read even by the comparatively small number of\r\nthe Members of Parliament who took the trouble to read the document\r\nat all. As for the writers of the newspaper press, and the general\r\npublic, they accepted without exception the statement that in 1868 not\r\nless than 18 per cent. of the towns in question, with an aggregate\r\npopulation of over 500,000, had no telegraphic service. As a matter of\r\nfact the statement applied only to 14.6 per cent. of the towns, with an\r\naggregate population of 388,000;[25] and many of the towns that still\r\nwere without service in 1868 would not have been in that condition, had\r\nnot the agitation for the nationalization of the telegraphs arrested\r\nthe investment of capital in telegraphs in the years 1865 to 1868.\r\n\r\n  Distance of the\r\n  Telegraph Station  Number of           Range of          Aggregate\r\n  from the Post        Towns            Population        Population\r\n  Office, miles\r\n\r\n  1.25                   7            2,000 to 16,000         43,000\r\n  1.50                   7            2,000 to 65,000         84,000\r\n  1.75                   2            2,000 to 4,000           6,000\r\n  2.00                   6            2,000 to 15,000         23,000\r\n  2.50                   3            3,000 to 5,000          11,000\r\n  3.00                   6            2,000 to 8,000          23,000\r\n  3.25                   1            4,000                    4,000\r\n  3.50                   4            2,000 to 4,000          11,000\r\n  3.75                   1            3,000                    3,000\r\n  4.00                   3            4,000                   12,000\r\n  4.50                   2            3,000                    6,000\r\n  4.75                   2            3,000 to 5,000           8,000\r\n  5.00                   7            2,000 to 37,000         62,000\r\n  5.50                   1            5,000                    5,000\r\n  6.00                   4            2,000 to 4,000          12,000\r\n  6.75                   1            4,000                    4,000\r\n  7.00                   5            4,000 to 7,000          27,000\r\n  9.00                   2            3,000 to 6,000           9,000\r\n  9.25                   1            3,000                    3,000\r\n  10.00                  2            3,000 to 6,000           9,000\r\n  12.50                  1            14,000                  14,000\r\n  14.00                  1            4,000                    4,000\r\n  17.75                  1            3,000                    3,000\r\n    ?                    1            2,000                    2,000\r\n                        71                                   388,000\r\n\r\nMr. Scudamore also submitted a table giving the total number of places\r\nwith money order issuing Post Offices in England and Wales, Scotland\r\nand Ireland; and stated what number of those places had respectively\r\nperfect telegraph accommodation, imperfect telegraphic accommodation,\r\nand no telegraphic accommodation.[26] Mr. Scudamore contended that the\r\npublic interest demanded that each one of those places should have\r\nat least one telegraph office, that office to be located as near the\r\ncentre of population as was the Post Office. He submitted no argument\r\nin support of that proposition. But Parliament and the public accepted\r\nthe proposition with avidity, since Mr. Scudamore promised that the\r\nextension required to give such a service would not cost more than\r\n$1,000,000, about 1/11 or 1/12 of the total sum invested by the several\r\ntelegraph companies. Mr. Scudamore also promised that, after the\r\nservice had been thus extended, the total operating expenses of the\r\nState telegraphs would be less than 45 per cent. of the gross receipts;\r\nthat the State telegraphs would at least pay their way, and that\r\nthey probably would yield a handsome profit. But when Mr. Scudamore\r\ncame to extend the State telegraphs, he spent upon extensions, not\r\n$1,000,000, but about $8,500,000, and when the State came to operate\r\nthe telegraphs, the operating expenses quickly ran up to 87 per cent.\r\nof the gross receipts in three years, 1874 to 1876. These errors of\r\nMr. Scudamore justify the statement that he made no case whatever\r\nagainst the system of _laissez-faire_, or private ownership, on the\r\nground of the extent of the facilities offered to the public, under the\r\nsystem of private ownership. For obviously it was one thing to condemn\r\nthe telegraph companies for not building certain extensions, those\r\nextensions being estimated to cost only $1,000,000, and a different\r\nthing altogether to condemn the telegraph companies for refusing to\r\nbuild out of hand extensions that would cost $8,500,000 and would be\r\nrelatively unremunerative, if not absolutely unprofitable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Tariffs and Growth of Traffic_]\r\n\r\nIt remains to consider whether the facts as to the charges made by the\r\ntelegraph companies for the transmission of messages, and the facts\r\nas to the rate of increase in the number of messages transmitted,\r\nsupported Mr. Scudamore's contention that the system of private\r\nownership of the telegraphs had failed to conserve and promote the\r\npublic interest.\r\n\r\nIn 1851, the Electric and International Telegraph Company carried\r\n99,216 messages, receiving on an average $2.41 per message. In 1856,\r\nthe year in which the Scotch Chambers of Commerce began the agitation\r\nfor nationalization, the company carried 812,323 messages, receiving on\r\nan average $0.99 per message. In 1865, the year in which the telegraph\r\ncompanies abolished the rate of 24 cents, irrespective of distance,\r\nthat had been in force between the leading cities, and the Chambers\r\nof Commerce increased the agitation for purchase by the State, the\r\nElectric and International carried 2,971,084 messages, receiving on an\r\naverage $0.49 a message. In the period from 1851 to 1867, the messages\r\ncarried by the company increased on an average by 28.76 per cent. a\r\nyear; the average receipts per message decreased on an average by 7.58\r\nper cent. a year; and the gross receipts of the company increased on an\r\naverage by 13.61 per cent. a year.\r\n\r\nIn the period 1855 to 1866, the messages carried annually by the\r\nBritish and Irish Magnetic Company grew from 264,727 to 1,520,640, an\r\naverage annual growth of 17.58 per cent. At the same time the average\r\nreceipts per message fell from $0.96 in 1855, to $0.48 in 1866.\r\n\r\nIn the period from 1855 to 1866, the number of messages carried\r\nannually by all of the telegraph companies of the United Kingdom\r\nincreased from 1,017,529, to 5,781,989, an average annual increase of\r\n16.36 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn the same period, from 1855 to 1866, the telegrams sent in\r\nSwitzerland increased on an average by 13.14 per cent. each year; those\r\nsent in Belgium increased on an average by 31.45 per cent.; and those\r\nsent in France increased on an average by 25.40 per cent. When one\r\ntakes into consideration that in Belgium, in 1867, only 38 per cent.\r\nof the messages transmitted related to stock exchange and commercial\r\nbusiness, and that in France in the same year only 48 per cent. of the\r\nmessages sent related to industrial, commercial, and stock exchange\r\ntransactions, there is nothing in the comparison between the rate of\r\ngrowth in the United Kingdom on the one hand, and in the countries\r\nof Continental Europe on the other hand, to indicate that the use of\r\nthe telegraphs for the purposes of trade and industry was held back\r\nin the United Kingdom by excessive charges or by lack of telegraphic\r\nfacilities. So far as the United Kingdom lagged behind, it did so\r\nbecause the public had not learned to use the telegraphs freely for\r\nthe transmission of personal and family news. And when, in 1875,\r\nunder State owned telegraphs, the public of the United Kingdom had\r\nlearned to use the telegraphs as freely as the public of Continental\r\nEurope used them, Mr. W. Stanley Jevons, the eminent British political\r\neconomist, in the course of a review of the price paid for this free\r\nuse of the telegraphs, said: \"A large part of the increased traffic\r\non the Government wires consists of complimentary messages, or other\r\ntrifling matters, which we can have no sufficient motive for promoting.\r\nMen have been known to telegraph for a clean pocket handkerchief\"--Mr.\r\nJevons, in 1866 to 1869, had been an ardent advocate of nationalizing\r\nthe telegraphs.[27]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Scudamore in 1866 to 1869 caused many people to believe that the\r\nUnited Kingdom was woefully behind the continental countries in the\r\nuse of the telegraphs. He did so by publishing a table which showed\r\nthat in 1866 there had been sent: in Belgium, 1 telegram to every 37\r\nletters carried by the Post Office; in Switzerland, 1 telegram to every\r\n69 letters; and in the United Kingdom, 1 telegram to every 121 letters.\r\nThat table, however, really proved nothing; for in 1866, there were\r\ncarried: in Belgium, 5 letters for every inhabitant; in Switzerland,\r\n10 letters; and in the United Kingdom, 25 letters. Had the people of\r\nBelgium and Switzerland written as many letters proportionately as the\r\npeople of the United Kingdom, the table prepared by Mr. Scudamore would\r\nhave read: Belgium, 1 telegram for every 185 letters; Switzerland, 1\r\ntelegram for every 172 letters; and the United Kingdom, 1 telegram for\r\nevery 121 letters.\r\n\r\nMr. Scudamore could, however, have prepared a table showing that the\r\npeople of Switzerland and Belgium used the telegraph more freely\r\nthan did the people of the United Kingdom, but not so much more\r\nfreely as to call for so drastic a remedy in the United Kingdom as\r\nthe nationalization of the telegraphs. The table in question would\r\nhave shown that in 1866, there was transmitted: in Switzerland, 1\r\ntelegram to every 3.75 inhabitants; in Belgium, 1 telegram to every\r\n4.25 inhabitants; and in the United Kingdom, 1 telegram to every 5.3\r\ninhabitants. The table in question would also have indicated the\r\nnecessity of care in the use of the several kinds of statistics just\r\nput before the reader. The table placed Switzerland in advance of\r\nBelgium, while the other sets of statistics had placed Belgium in\r\nadvance of Switzerland.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Alleged Wastefulness of Competition_]\r\n\r\nMr. Scudamore's concluding argument was that little or no relief from\r\nthe evils from which the public was suffering could be expected \"so\r\nlong as the working of the telegraphs was conducted by commercial\r\ncompanies striving chiefly to earn a dividend, and engaged in wasteful\r\ncompetition.\" In support of the charge of wasteful competition he\r\nstated \"that many large districts are provided with duplicate and\r\ntriplicate lines, worked by different companies, but taking much the\r\nsame course and serving precisely the same places; and that these\r\nduplicate or triplicate lines and duplicate or triplicate offices only\r\ndivide the business without materially increasing the accommodation of\r\nthe districts or towns which they serve.\" But when Mr. Scudamore sought\r\nto substantiate this charge of waste arising out of competition, he\r\ncould do no more than state that not less than 2,000 miles of line in\r\na total of 16,066 miles were redundant, and that perhaps 300 to 350\r\noffices in a total of 2,040 offices were redundant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe evidence presented by Mr. Scudamore failed to reveal a situation\r\nthat called for so drastic a remedy as the nationalization of\r\nthe telegraphs. It revealed no evils or shortcomings that it was\r\nunreasonable to expect would be sufficiently mitigated, if not entirely\r\nremoved, by the measures proposed by the telegraph companies.\r\n\r\nMr. Robert Grimston, Chairman of the Electric and International\r\nTelegraph Company, stated that the telegraph companies long since would\r\nhave asked Parliament to permit them to consolidate, had there been\r\nthe least likelihood of Parliament granting the request. Consolidation\r\nwould have made the resulting amalgamated company so strong that the\r\ncompany would have been justified in adopting a bolder policy in the\r\nmatter of extending the telegraph lines to places remote from the\r\nrailways. No single company could afford to assume too large a burden\r\nof lines that would begin as \"suckers\" rather than \"feeders.\" A company\r\nwith a large burden of that kind would be in a precarious position,\r\nbecause any of the other existing companies, or some new company, might\r\ntake advantage of the situation and cut heavily into that part of the\r\ncompany's business that was carried on between the large cities and was\r\nbearing the burden of the non-paying extensions. But if the existing\r\ncompanies were to consolidate, the resulting company would become so\r\nstrong that it need not fear such competition from any company newly\r\nto be organized. That there was much strength in that argument appears\r\nfrom the fact that, in 1869, Mr. Scudamore as well as the Government\r\nadopted it in support of the request that the State be given the\r\nmonopoly of the business of transmitting messages by electricity. Mr.\r\nScudamore argued that since the State was going to assume the burden of\r\nbuilding and operating a large number of unprofitable, or relatively\r\nunprofitable, extensions, it should not be exposed to the possibility\r\nof competition from companies organized for the purpose of tapping the\r\nprofitable traffic between the large cities, \"the very cream of the\r\nbusiness.\" Mr. Scudamore added that he had been told that a company\r\nwas on the verge of being organized for the purpose of competing for\r\nthe business between the large towns as soon as the properties of the\r\nexisting companies should have been transferred to the State.[28]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Companies' Proposal_]\r\n\r\nThe telegraph companies proposed to give the public substantial\r\nsafeguards against the possibility of being exploited by the proposed\r\namalgamated company. They proposed that Parliament should fix maximum\r\ncharges for the transmission of messages, in conjunction with a limit\r\non dividends that might be exceeded only on condition that the existing\r\ncharges on messages be reduced by a stated amount every time that\r\nthe dividend be raised a stated amount beyond the limit fixed. The\r\ncompanies proposed also that shares to be issued in the future should\r\nbe sold at public auction, and that any premiums realized from such\r\nsales should be invested in the plant with the condition that they\r\nshould not be entitled to any dividend. Provisions such as these,\r\nat the time, were in force in the case of certain gas companies and\r\nwater companies. They have for years past been incorporated in all gas\r\ncompany charters; and they have worked well. There was no reason, in\r\n1866 to 1869, why the proposals of the telegraph companies should not\r\nbe accepted; that is, no reason from the view-point of the man who\r\nhesitated to exchange the evils and shortcomings incident to private\r\nownership for the evils and shortcomings incident to public ownership.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[17] _The Edinburgh Review_, July, 1870.\r\n\r\n[18] _Annales télégraphiques_, 1860, p. 547.\r\n\r\nThe company obtained a concession covering the whole of Belgium.

The Government raises its estimate to\r\n     $30,000,000; adding that it could afford to pay $40,000,000\r\n     to $50,000,000. Mr. Goschen, M. P., and Mr. Leeman, M. P.,\r\n     warn the House of Commons against the Government's estimates,\r\n     which had been prepared by Mr. Scudamore. The Gladstone\r\n     Ministry, relying on Mr. Scudamore, estimates at $3,500,000\r\n     the \"reversionary rights\" of the railway companies, for which\r\n     rights the State ultimately paid $10,000,000 to $11,000,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn April 1, 1868, the Disraeli Government brought into Parliament a\r\n\"Bill to enable the Postmaster General to acquire, work, and maintain\r\nElectric Telegraphs in the United Kingdom.\"[29] At this time the\r\nGovernment still was ignorant of the precise relations existing between\r\nthe telegraph companies and the railways; and it did not foresee that\r\nthe purchase of the assets of the telegraph companies would lead to the\r\npurchase of the reversionary rights of the railways in the telegraphs,\r\nthe telegraphs having been, for the most part, erected on the lands\r\nof the railways, under leases of way-leaves that still had to run,\r\non an average, 23.7 years. At this time, therefore, the Government\r\ncontemplated only the purchase of the Electric and International\r\nCompany, the British and Irish Company, the United Kingdom Company,\r\nand the London and Provincial, the successor of the London District\r\nTelegraph Company.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Purchase Price estimated at $15,000,000 to $20,000,000_]\r\n\r\nIn the course of the debate upon the order for the Second Reading of\r\nthe Bill, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. G. W. Hunt, said that\r\n\"if the House would excuse him, he would rather not enter fully into\r\ndetails with respect to the purchase at present. But he would say that,\r\nspeaking roughly, it would take something near $20,000,000, or, at\r\nall events, between $15,000,000 and $20,000,000 for the purchase and\r\nthe necessary extensions of the lines.\" He added that if the purchase\r\nshould be made, the telegraphs would yield a net revenue of $1,050,000\r\na year; and that sum would suffice to pay the interest on the debt to\r\nbe contracted, and to clear off that debt in twenty-nine years.[30]\r\n\r\nParliament was to be prorogued in August; and a General Election was\r\nto follow prorogation. The Government naturally was anxious to avoid\r\nhaving to go into the General Election without having achieved the\r\nnationalization of the telegraphs; particularly, since the opposition\r\nparty also had committed itself to State purchase. Then again, the\r\nGovernment believed that the value of the telegraphs was increasing so\r\nrapidly that the State would lose money by any postponement of the act\r\nof purchase. For these reasons the Government entered into negotiations\r\nwith the various interests that evinced a disposition to oppose in\r\nParliament the Government's Bill, until finally all opposition was\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Politics forces Government's Hand_]\r\n\r\nThe Bill, as introduced, proposed that the State pay the four telegraph\r\ncompanies enumerated, the money actually invested by them--about\r\n$11,500,000--together with an allowance for the prospective increase\r\nof the earnings of the companies, and an additional allowance for\r\ncompulsory sale. The last two items were to be fixed by an arbitrator\r\nwho was to be appointed by the Board of Trade. The companies flatly\r\nrejected this offer, pointing, by way of precedent, to the Act of 1844,\r\nwhich fixed the terms to be given to the railways, should the State at\r\nany time resolve upon the compulsory purchase of the railways. The Act\r\nin question prescribed: \"twenty-five years' purchase of the average\r\nannual divisible profits for three years before such purchase, provided\r\nthese profits shall equal or exceed 10 per cent. on the capital; and,\r\nif not, the railway company shall be at liberty to claim any further\r\nsum for anticipated profits, to be fixed by arbitration.\"\r\n\r\nThe Government next offered the companies the highest market price\r\nreached by the stock of the companies on the London Stock Exchange\r\nup to May 28, 1868, plus an allowance for prospective profits, to be\r\nfixed by arbitration. The companies rejected that offer, but accepted\r\nthe next one, namely, twenty years' purchase of the profits of the year\r\nthat was to end with June 30, 1868.[31] Mr. W. H. Smith, one of the\r\nmost highly esteemed Members of the House of Commons, who was himself\r\na director in the Electric and International, subsequently spoke as\r\nfollows of these negotiations: \"In 1868 the telegraph companies were\r\nby no means desirous to part with their property, but the question\r\nwhether the Government should be in possession of the telegraphs having\r\nbeen forced on their consideration, the three principal companies\r\nvery reluctantly came to an arrangement with the Government of the\r\nday. He did not wish to express any opinion on the bargain which had\r\nbeen made, and would only say for himself and those with whom he was\r\nassociated, that they very deeply regretted to be obliged to part with\r\nproperty which had been profitable, and which they had great pleasure\r\nin managing.\"[32] Mr. Smith added that the net earnings of the Electric\r\nand International had increased from $336,815 in 1862, to $859,215 in\r\n1868; and that the average annual increase per cent. had been 17.2 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nThe state of the public mind at the time when the\r\n\r\nGovernment introduced its Bill, was indicated in the issue of April\r\n11, 1868, of _The Economist_, the leading financial newspaper of Great\r\nBritain. Said the journal in question: \"Even if the companies resist,\r\nthey will not be very powerful opponents--firstly, because the leaders\r\nof both parties have already sanctioned the scheme; and, secondly,\r\nbecause the companies are exceptionally unpopular. There is, probably,\r\nno interest in the Kingdom which is so cordially disliked by the press,\r\nwhich, when united, is stronger than any interest, and which has\r\nsuffered for years under the shortcomings of the private companies.\r\nThe real discussion in Parliament, should there be any, will turn\r\nupon a very different point, and it will be not a little interesting\r\nto observe how far the current of opinion on the subject of State\r\ninterference with private enterprise, has really ebbed within the last\r\nfew years. Twelve or fourteen years ago it would have been useless for\r\nany Chancellor of the Exchequer to propose such an operation.... It was\r\n[at that time] believed on all sides that State interference was wrong,\r\nbecause it shut out the private speculators from the natural reward of\r\ntheir energy and labor.\"\r\n\r\nBefore the Select Committee of the House of Commons to which was\r\nreferred the Government's Bill, Mr. Scudamore argued that if Parliament\r\ncould not make a reasonable bargain with the telegraph companies, it\r\ncould authorize the Post Office to build a system of telegraphs. But\r\nthat measure ought to be adopted only as a last resource. It was of\r\nparamount importance to avoid shaking the confidence of the investors\r\nthat private enterprise would be allowed to reap the full benefits of\r\nits enterprise, and that it would be exposed to nothing more than the\r\nordinary vicissitudes of trade. That the possibility of competition by\r\nthe State, by means of money taken from the people by taxation, never\r\nhad been included within the ordinary vicissitudes of trade. Coming to\r\nthe question of paying twenty years' purchase of the profits of the\r\nyear 1867-1868, Mr. Scudamore said: \"The telegraphs are so much more\r\nvaluable a property than we originally believed, that if you do not buy\r\nthem this year, you unquestionably will have to pay $2,500,000 more for\r\nthem next year.... Their [average] annual growth of profit is certainly\r\nnot less than ten per cent. at present. If you wait till next year\r\nand only give them nineteen years' purchase, you will give them more\r\nthan you will now give. If you wait two years, and give them eighteen\r\nyears' purchase, you will still give them more than you will now give,\r\nassuming the annual growth of profit to be the same. If you wait four\r\nyears, and give them sixteen years' purchase, you will again give them\r\nmore, and in addition you will have lost the benefit accruing in the\r\nfour years, which would have gone into their pockets instead of coming\r\ninto the pockets of the nation.\"[33]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Purchase price estimated at $30,000,000_]\r\n\r\nIn the House of Commons, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. G. W.\r\nHunt, said: \"The terms agreed upon, although very liberal, were not\r\nmore liberal than they should be under the circumstances, and did\r\nnot offer more than an arbitrator would have given. The companies\r\nhad agreed to sell at twenty years' purchase of present net profits,\r\nalthough those profits were increasing at the rate of 10 per cent. a\r\nyear. He was satisfied the more the House looked into the matter, the\r\nmore they would be satisfied with the bargain made.\"[34] The Chancellor\r\nof the Exchequer continued with the statement that Mr. Scudamore\r\nestimated that the Postmaster General would obtain from the telegraphs\r\na net revenue of $1,015,000 at the minimum, and $1,790,000 at the\r\nmaximum. The mean of those estimates was $1,402,500, which sum would\r\npay the interest and sinking fund payments--3.5 per cent. in all--on\r\n$40,000,000. The Government, therefore, could afford to pay $40,000,000\r\nfor the telegraphs. Indeed, on the basis of the maximum estimate of net\r\nrevenue, it could pay $50,000,000. But Mr. Scudamore confidently fixed\r\nat $30,000,000 at the maximum, the price that the Government would\r\nhave to pay. Mr. Scudamore's estimates of net revenue \"would stand any\r\namount of examination by the House, as they had stood very careful\r\nscrutiny by the Select Committee, and for the Government to carry out\r\nthe scheme would not only prove safe but profitable.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time the Government had learned that it would be necessary\r\nto purchase the reversionary rights of the railway companies in the\r\nbusiness of the telegraph companies. The Government had agreed with\r\nthe railway companies upon the terms under which it was to be left to\r\narbitration how much should be paid for those reversionary rights. The\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer stated that he was unwilling to divulge\r\nthe Government's estimates of what sums would be awarded under the\r\narbitration; for, if he did divulge them, they might be used against\r\nthe Government before the arbitrators. \"But Mr. Scudamore, whose\r\nability with regard not only to this matter, but also to other matters,\r\nhad been of great service to the Government, had given considerable\r\nattention to the matter, and Mr. Scudamore believed that $30,000,000\r\nwould be the outside figure\" to be paid to the telegraph companies and\r\nthe railway companies. The Chancellor of the Exchequer added that Mr.\r\nScudamore's \"calculations had been submitted to and approved by Mr.\r\nFoster, the principal finance officer of the Treasury.\"\r\n\r\nIn passing, it may be stated that Mr. Foster had stated before the\r\nSelect Committee of the House of Commons that he had given only \"two or\r\nthree days\" to the consideration of the extremely difficult question of\r\nthe value that the arbitrators would be likely to put upon the railway\r\ncompanies' reversionary rights.[35]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Parliament warned against Government's Estimates_]\r\n\r\nMr. Goschen, of the banking firm of Frühling and Goschen, who had\r\nbeen a member of the Select Committee, and had taken an active part\r\nin its proceedings, replied that \"the inquiry [by the committee] had\r\nbeen carried on under great disadvantages. An opposition, organized by\r\nprivate interests [the telegraph companies and the railway companies],\r\nhad been changed into an organization of warm supporters of the Bill\r\npending the inquiry. Before the Committee there appeared Counsel\r\nrepresenting the promoters [_i. e._, the Government], and, at first,\r\ncounsel representing the original opposition to the Bill [_i. e._ the\r\ntelegraph and railway companies]; but in consequence of the change\r\nin the views of the opposition, who during the proceedings became\r\nfriendly to the Bill, there was no counsel present to cross-examine the\r\nwitnesses. Consequently, in the interests of the public, and in order\r\nthat all the facts might be brought to light, members of the committee\r\n[chiefly Mr. Goschen and Mr. Leeman] had to discharge the duty of\r\ncross-examining the witnesses. The same causes led to the result that\r\nthe witnesses produced were all on one side.\" ...[36]\r\n\r\nMr. Goschen emphasized the fact that upon the expiring of the telegraph\r\ncompanies' leases of rights of way over the railways, the reversionary\r\nrights of the railways would come into play, and that the Government,\r\nafter having paid twenty years' purchase to the telegraph companies,\r\n\"would probably have to pay half as much again to the railways.\" \"The\r\nrailways had felt the strength of their position so much, that they\r\nhad pointed out to the committee that they would not only be entitled\r\nto an increase in the rate which they now received [as rent from the\r\ntelegraph companies] as soon as the leases expired, but they would\r\nalso be entitled to an indemnification [from the State] for the\r\nloss they would sustain in not being allowed [in consequence of the\r\nnationalization of the telegraphs] to put the screw on the telegraph\r\ncompanies.\" Mr. Goschen said \"he felt very strongly on this point\r\nbecause he was convinced that it was impossible to find an instance\r\nof any private enterprise which, while it returned a profit of 15 per\r\ncent. to its shareholders, enjoyed a monopoly for any great length\r\nof time.\" If the Government purchased the assets of the telegraph\r\ncompanies, the railway companies would succeed in compelling the State\r\nto share with them the great profits to be obtained from the business\r\nof telegraphy. They would do so by compelling the Government to pay a\r\nbig sum for their reversionary rights in the telegraph companies, as\r\nthe price for abstaining from building up a telegraph business of their\r\nown, upon the expiry of the telegraph companies' leases. No business\r\nthat yielded a return of 15 per cent. could be worth twenty years'\r\npurchase, for such returns were very insecure, because of the certainty\r\nthat competition would arise from persons who would be content with ten\r\nper cent., or less.[37]\r\n\r\nMr. Leeman, who had sat on the Select Committee, and had, with Mr.\r\nGoschen, done all of the cross-examining directed to bring out the\r\npoints that told against the Government's proposal, followed Mr.\r\nGoschen in the debate. He began by stating that he spoke with \"twenty\r\nyears' experience as a railway man;\" and he directed his argument\r\nespecially against the terms of the agreements made by the Government\r\nto purchase the reversionary rights of the railways in the telegraph\r\ncompanies' businesses. \"Mr. Scudamore, who was what he had already been\r\ndescribed to be--a most able man--had not known, up to the time of\r\nthe second reading of the Bill [June 8, 1868], what were the existing\r\narrangements between the telegraph companies and the railway companies;\r\nand, subsequently, while still without the requisite knowledge on\r\nthat point,[38] he went and agreed on the part of the Government to\r\nbuy the interest of the telegraph companies at 20 years' purchase of\r\ntheir profits. In addition it was to be remembered that the railway\r\ncompanies had reversionary interests which would come into operation\r\nafter comparatively short time for which their arrangements with the\r\ntelegraph companies were to continue. In July, 1866, Mr. Scudamore\r\nestimated the necessary outlay on the part of the Government at\r\n$12,000,000. In February, 1868, another officer of the Government\r\nraised the estimate to $15,000,000; but it was not until the Bill\r\ncame before the committee [July, 1868], that Mr. Scudamore said that\r\n$30,000,000 would be required.... He [Mr. Leeman] undertook to say that\r\nMr. Scudamore was as wide of the mark in his estimate of $30,000,000,\r\nas he had been in his estimate of $12,000,000. At the expiration of\r\ntheir agreements with the telegraph companies, several [all] of the\r\nrailway companies would have it in their power to compete with the\r\nPost Office in the transmission of telegraphic messages. No doubt\r\nthis fact would be brought under the notice of the arbitrators when\r\nthe value of their reversion was being considered, and at what price\r\nwould the arbitrators value this reversionary power of competition?\r\nHad Mr. Scudamore made any estimate on the subject? Owing to the\r\nposition in which Mr. Scudamore had placed the Government, the railway\r\ncompanies had demanded and had been promised terms in respect of their\r\nreversions, which he, as a railway man, now said it was the duty of any\r\nGovernment to have resisted.\" ...[39]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Railway Companies' Reversionary Rights_]\r\n\r\nFor the better understanding of this question of reversions, it must\r\nbe stated that the telegraph companies, for the most part, had erected\r\ntheir poles and wires on the permanent way of the railway companies,\r\nunder leases of way-leaves, which, in 1868, still had 23.7 years to\r\nrun, on the average.[40] As the leases should expire, the railway\r\ncompanies would have an opportunity to try to obtain better terms,\r\nor to order the companies to remove their plant, and then to erect\r\ntheir own plant, and themselves engage in the telegraph business. But\r\nthe railway companies were handicapped by the fact that the leases\r\ndid not expire together, and that it would be difficult to build up\r\na new telegraph system piecemeal out of the parts of line that would\r\nbecome free in the next three years to twenty-nine years. There was,\r\ntherefore, much room for difference of opinion on the question how far\r\nthe railway companies would be able \"to put the screw\" on the telegraph\r\ncompanies upon the successive expirations of leases. The Stock Exchange\r\ndoubtless took the contingency into consideration, that being one\r\nreason why the Electric and International shares did not rise above\r\nfourteen years' purchase of the annual dividends. Mr. Scudamore, before\r\nthe Select Committee, expressed the opinion that the railway companies\r\ncould force the telegraph companies \"to give them somewhat better\r\nterms; that would be the extreme result of any negotiations between\r\nthe telegraph companies and the railway companies.\" To Mr. Foster,\r\nprincipal officer of the Finance Division of the Treasury, whom the\r\nGovernment called to support Mr. Scudamore's evidence, Mr. Leeman put\r\nthe question: \"Looking at it as a financial question, do you suppose\r\nall the railways in the country, having power to work their telegraphs\r\nat the end of ten years, but for this Bill, will not put in a claim for\r\na very large sum in respect of that reversion?\" The witness replied: \"I\r\ndo not think it would be of very great value in the first place, and in\r\nthe next place it would be a value deferred for ten years, which would\r\nvery much diminish it.\" To the further query: \"You do not take the view\r\nthat we shall have to pay the railway companies and also the telegraph\r\ncompanies for the same thing,\" he replied in the negative.[41]\r\n\r\nShortly after the Government's Bill had been referred to the Select\r\nCommittee, the Government made the railway companies this proposition,\r\nwhich was accepted. The Government was to acquire perpetual and\r\nexclusive way-leaves for telegraph lines over the railways, and the\r\nprice to be paid therefor was to be left to arbitration. The railway\r\ncompanies were to have the choice of presenting their claims either\r\nunder the head of payment for the cession of perpetual and exclusive\r\nway-leaves to the Government; or, under the head of compensation\r\nfor the loss of right to grant way-leaves to any one other than the\r\nGovernment, as well as for the loss of right themselves to transmit\r\nmessages, except on their own railway business. The Government was\r\nof the opinion that the sums to be paid to the railways under this\r\nagreement would not be large enough to raise above $30,000,000, the\r\ntotal sum to be paid to the telegraph companies and the railways.\r\n\r\nParliament enacted the Bill of 1868 authorizing the Government to\r\npurchase the property of the telegraph companies and the rights of the\r\nrailways; but it provided that the resulting Act of 1868 should not\r\ntake effect, unless, in the Session of 1869, Parliament should put at\r\nthe disposal of the Postmaster General such monies as were required to\r\ncarry out the provisions of the Act of 1868.\r\n\r\nThe Government immediately appointed a committee to ascertain the\r\nprofits earned by the telegraph companies in the year that had ended\r\nwith June, 1868. The committee, which consisted of the Receiver and\r\nAccountant General of the Post Office, and other gentlemen selected\r\nfrom the Post Office for their general ability, but especially for\r\ntheir knowledge of accounts, in June and July, 1869, reported that\r\nthe aggregate of the sums to be paid to the six telegraph companies\r\nwas $28,575,235,[42] the companies having put in claims aggregating\r\n$35,180,185.\r\n\r\nWhile the Bill had been before the Select Committee, the Government\r\nhad agreed to purchase the properties of Reuters Telegram Company\r\n(Norderney Cable), as well as of the Universal Private Company. The\r\nprice paid for those properties absorbed the margin on which Mr.\r\nScudamore and the Government had counted for the purchase of the\r\nreversionary rights of the railways.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Disraeli Ministry, which had carried the measure\r\nof 1868, had been replaced, on December 9, 1868, by the Gladstone\r\nMinistry. On July 5, 1869, the Marquis of Hartington, Postmaster\r\nGeneral, laid before Parliament a Bill authorizing the Post Office\r\nDepartment to spend $35,000,000 for the purpose of carrying out the\r\nact of 1868. The Marquis of Hartington said that $28,575,000 would be\r\nrequired for the purchase of the assets of the telegraph companies;\r\nthat $3,500,000 would cover the claims of the railways, which had not\r\nyet been adjusted; and that $1,500,000 would suffice to rearrange the\r\ntelegraph lines and to make such extensions as would be required to\r\ngive Government telegraph offices to 3,776 places, towns, and cities,\r\nthe present number of places having telegraph offices being 1,882.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Hartington stated that Parliament \"was quite competent\r\nto repudiate the bargain of 1868, if they thought it a bad one....\r\nHaving given the subject his best consideration, he must say, without\r\nexpressing any opinion as to the terms of the bargain, that if they\r\nwere to begin afresh, he did not think they could get the property\r\non better terms.\" He added that the \"Government would take over the\r\ntelegraphs of the companies on January 1, 1870, on the basis of paying\r\ntwenty times the profits of the year 1867-68. But that in consequence\r\nof the increase of the business since 1867-68, the $28,575,000 which\r\nthe State would pay the telegraph companies, would represent, not\r\ntwenty years' purchase of the profits in 1870, but considerably under\r\nseventeen years' purchase of those profits. The trade of the Electric\r\nand International had been found to be growing at the rate of 18 per\r\ncent. a year; that of the British and Irish at the rate of 32 per\r\ncent.\"[43]\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Robert Lowe, was by no means\r\nso sanguine. He spoke of the \"immense price\" which the Government\r\nwas asked to pay, \"a price of which he, at all events, washed his\r\nhands altogether. The Right Honorable Gentlemen opposite [Mr. Hunt,\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer in 1868], had accused them of appropriating\r\nthe honor of this measure. He had not the slightest desire to contest\r\nthe point with the Right Honorable Gentleman, who was welcome to it\r\nall. The matter was found by the present Government in so complicated a\r\nstate that it was impossible for them to recede; but unless the House\r\nwas prepared to grant that [_i. e._ a government monopoly] without\r\nwhich they believed it would be impossible to carry on the business\r\neffectively, it would be better that they should reject the Bill\r\naltogether.\"[44]\r\n\r\nMr. Torrens moved an amendment adverse to the Bill, but his motion was\r\ndefeated by a vote of 148 to 23. Before the vote was taken, Mr. W.\r\nFowler, of the firm of Alexander & Company, Lombard Street, speaking of\r\nthe reversionary rights of the railway companies, had said: \"Therefore,\r\nfor what the House knew, there might be contingent liabilities for\r\nhundreds of thousands or millions of pounds sterling more.\"[45]\r\n\r\nThe measure became a law in August, 1869; and on February 5, 1870, the\r\ntelegraphs of the United Kingdom were transferred to the Post Office\r\nDepartment. In the course of the year 1870, the Government bought\r\nthe properties of the Jersey and Guernsey Company and of the Isle of\r\nMan Company. Those purchases, together with a large number of minor\r\npurchases made in 1869, but not previously mentioned, raised the total\r\nsum paid to the telegraph companies to $29,236,735.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Reversionary Rights estimated at $3,500,000 cost\r\n$10,000,000_]\r\n\r\nNot until 1879 were the last of the claims of the railway companies\r\nadjusted. The writer has not succeeded in finding a specific official\r\nstatement of the aggregate sum paid to the railway companies for their\r\nreversionary rights and for the grant to the Post Office of perpetual\r\nand exclusive way-leaves over their properties, but he infers that\r\nthat sum was $10,000,000 or $11,000,000. That inference is based on\r\ntestimony given in 1888 by Mr. C. H. B. Patey,[46] Third Secretary to\r\nthe Post Office, and on information given by the Postmaster General in\r\n1895.[47] It will be recalled, that in 1869, the Marquis of Hartington,\r\nPostmaster General, had told the House of Commons that the payments\r\nfor the rights in question would not exceed $3,500,000. The Postmaster\r\nGeneral doubtless spoke on the strength of assurances given by Mr.\r\nScudamore. It will be remembered also that Mr. Leeman, in 1868, had\r\nwarned the House in strong terms that Mr. Scudamore's estimates were\r\nnot to be trusted. Finally, it will be remembered that in 1869, Mr. W.\r\nFowler, a financier of high standing, had warned the House of Commons\r\nthat \"there might be contingent liabilities of thousands or millions of\r\npounds sterling more.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[29] _Hansard's Parliamentary Debates_, April 1, 1868, p. 678, the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer.\r\n\r\n[30] _Hansard's Parliamentary Debates_, June 9, 1868, p. 1,305.\r\n\r\n[31] _Special Report from the Select Committee on the Electric\r\nTelegraphs Bill_, 1868.

SCUDAMORE'S FINANCIAL FORECASTS WERE REALIZED\r\n\r\n     The completion of the telegraph system cost $8,500,000;\r\n     Mr. Scudamore's successive estimates had been respectively\r\n     $1,000,000 and $1,500,000. Mr. Scudamore's brilliant forecast\r\n     of the increase of traffic under public ownership. Mr.\r\n     Scudamore's appalling blunder in predicting that the State\r\n     telegraphs would be self-supporting. Operating expenses on the\r\n     average exceed 92.5% of the gross earnings, in contrast to\r\n     Mr. Scudamore's estimate of 51% to 56%. The annual telegraph\r\n     deficits aggregate 26.5% of the capital invested in the plant.\r\n     The financial failure of the State telegraphs is not due to\r\n     the large price paid to the telegraph companies and railway\r\n     companies. The disillusionment of an eminent advocate of\r\n     nationalization, Mr. W. Stanley Jevons.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Estimated Expenditure_ versus _Actual Expenditure_]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the telegraphs had been transferred to the Government, the\r\nPost Office Department set to work to rearrange the wires wherever\r\ncompetition had caused duplication or triplication; to extend the\r\nwires into the centre of each town or place \"imperfectly\" served;\r\nto build lines to all places with money order issuing Post Offices\r\nthat had no telegraphic service; to enlarge the local telegraph\r\nsystem of Metropolitan London from 95 telegraph offices in 1869, to\r\n334 offices at the close of 1870; to give cities like Birmingham,\r\nLeeds, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Manchester, from 14 to 32 telegraph\r\noffices each;[48] to provide additional wires to meet the anticipated\r\ngrowth of traffic; and to release some 5,000 or 6,000 miles of wire\r\nfor the exclusive use of the railway companies in the conduct of\r\ntransportation. For these several purposes the Post Office Department,\r\nin the course of the three years ending with September, 1873, erected\r\n8,000 miles of posts, and 46,000 miles of wire; strengthened 8,500\r\nmiles of line; laid 192 miles of underground pipes and 23 miles of\r\npneumatic pipes; and laid 248 miles of submarine cable. By September,\r\n1873, the Post Office Department had spent upon the rearrangement and\r\nextension of the telegraphs, the sum of $11,041,000.[49]\r\n\r\nSomething over $2,500,000[50] of that sum represented the cost of\r\nrepairing the depreciation suffered by the plant in the years 1868 and\r\n1869, a depreciation for which full allowance had been made in fixing\r\nthe purchase price. The balance, $8,500,000, represented new capital\r\noutlay.\r\n\r\nIn 1868 Mr. Scudamore had stated before the Select Committee of the\r\nHouse of Commons that it would cost $1,000,000 to rearrange the\r\ntelegraphs and give perfect telegraphic service to 2,950 places.[51] In\r\n1869, the Postmaster General, the Marquis of Hartington, had told the\r\nHouse of Commons that $1,500,000 would cover the cost of rearranging\r\nthe telegraphs and giving perfect accommodation to 3,776 places.[52]\r\nIn April, 1867, on the other hand, Mr. W. Stanley Jevons, an eminent\r\neconomist, had estimated at $12,500,000 the cost of \"the improvement of\r\nthe present telegraphs, and their extension to many villages which do\r\nnot at present possess a telegraph station.\"[53]\r\n\r\nMr. Scudamore's estimate of the cost of extending the telegraphs to\r\n841 places that had no telegraphic accommodation, was based on the\r\nassumption that each such extension would require, on the average,\r\nthe erection of three-quarters of a mile of telegraph line. But when\r\nthe Post Office Department came to build to \"new\" places, it found\r\nthat \"the opening of upward of 1,000 additional telegraph offices\r\nnecessitated the erection of not less than 3,000 miles of telegraph\r\nline.\"[54]\r\n\r\nThe results have shown that Mr. Scudamore's other estimates of the\r\ncost of rearranging and extending the telegraphs, presented by himself\r\nin 1868, and by the Postmaster General, the Marquis of Hartington,\r\nin 1869, were equally wide of the mark. Numerous _Committees on the\r\nPublic Accounts_ sitting in the years 1871 to 1876, together with\r\nthe _Committee on Post Office Telegraph Department_, 1876, attempted\r\nto inquire into the enormous discrepancy between the estimated cost\r\nand the actual cost of rearranging and extending the telegraphs. But\r\nnone of those attempts were rewarded with any success whatever.[55]\r\nThe representatives of the Post Office and of the Treasury always\r\nattributed the discrepancy \"to the purchase of undertakings which were\r\nnot contemplated at the time when the original measures were submitted\r\nto the House, and to unforeseen expenses for extensions.\" But the\r\nState, as a matter of fact, made no purchases beyond those contemplated\r\nin 1869--excepting the purchase of the Jersey and Guernsey cable for\r\n$286,750, and the purchase of the Isle of Man cable for $80,680. As for\r\nunforeseen extensions, in 1869, the Marquis of Hartington had counted\r\non carrying the telegraphs to 3,776 places, and in 1878 there were but\r\n3,761 postal telegraph offices, counting the 300 offices in London, and\r\nthe numerous offices in the several large principal cities.[56]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Scudamore, aided by the state of public opinion created by the\r\nagitation of the British Chambers of Commerce under the leadership\r\nof the Chamber of Commerce of Edinburgh, carried away the Disraeli\r\nMinistry and the Gladstone Ministry. Even more powerful than Mr.\r\nScudamore's argument from the extensive use made of the telegraphs on\r\nthe Continent of Europe, was Mr. Scudamore's promise that the State\r\ntelegraphs should begin by paying a profit sufficient to cover the\r\ninterest on $30,000,000 at the lowest estimate, and $50,000,000 at\r\nthe highest estimate; and that the profit should increase with the\r\nadvancing years.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Penny Postage Precedent_]\r\n\r\nBefore examining the evidence upon which Mr. Scudamore predicted such\r\nlarge profits, it will be well to consider briefly the nature of the\r\nevidence afforded to Mr. Scudamore by Sir Rowland Hill's epoch-making\r\n\"invention of penny postage.\" This is the more necessary, since Mr.\r\nScudamore himself cited the success of penny postage in support of\r\nhis proposal for a uniform rate of 24 cents for telegraph messages.\r\nUpon the introduction of the penny postage, the letters carried by the\r\nPost Office of the United Kingdom jumped from 76,000,000 in 1839 to\r\n169,000,000 in 1840, and to 271,000,000 in 1845. But the net revenue\r\nobtained by the Post Office Department from the carriage of letters\r\nfell from $8,170,000 in 1839 to $2,505,000 in 1840. Though the net\r\nrevenue increased each year beginning with 1841, not until 1863 did\r\nit again reach the point at which it had been in 1839. In 1863, the\r\nnumber of letters carried was 642,000,000--almost four times the number\r\ncarried in 1840, and eight times the number carried in 1839.[57] In\r\nshort, the evidence from the penny postage was, that care must be\r\nused in arguing from an increase of business to an increase of net\r\nrevenue; and that the prospect of a great increase in business did not\r\nnecessarily justify the incurrence of indefinitely large charges on\r\naccount of interest on capital invested.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Mr. Scudamore's Revenue Forecasts_]\r\n\r\nMr. Scudamore began by assuming that the Post Office would take charge\r\nof the telegraphs on July 1, 1869; and that by that time the telegraph\r\ncompanies would have developed a business of 7,500,000 messages a year.\r\nOn the basis of the traffic of 1866, and under the companies' charges,\r\n55 per cent. of the business would consist of messages carried 100\r\nmiles or less, which would be charged 24 cents each; 30 per cent. would\r\nbe messages carried from 100 to 200 miles, being charged 36 cents each;\r\n10 per cent. would be messages carried beyond 200 miles, which would be\r\ncharged 48 cents; and, finally, 5 per cent. would consist of messages\r\nto and from Ireland, which would be charged from 72 cents to 96 cents.\r\nThe adoption of the uniform rate of 24 cents, irrespective of distance,\r\nwould reduce by 33 per cent. the charge on the messages sent from 100\r\nto 200 miles, and would increase those messages by 90 per cent.; it\r\nwould reduce by 50 per cent. the charge on the messages carried more\r\nthan 200 miles, and would increase those messages by 90 per cent.; and,\r\nfinally, it would increase by 150 per cent. the number of messages\r\nbetween Great Britain and Ireland. The introduction of the uniform 24\r\ncent rate, therefore, would increase the total number of messages from\r\n7,500,000 to 10,612,500. That last number would be further increased by\r\n10 per cent. in consequence of the general increase of facilities, and\r\na material reduction in the charges made for the delivery of messages\r\nto points outside of the free delivery areas. Thus the total number of\r\nmessages that the Post Office telegraphs would carry in the first year\r\nwould be 11,673,000, or, say, in round numbers, 11,650,000.\r\n\r\nSince the average message would be somewhat over 20 words in length,\r\none might count on average receipts per message of 28 cents; so that\r\nthe 11,650,000 messages in question would bring the Post Office a gross\r\nrevenue of $3,400,000.\r\n\r\nMr. Scudamore next proceeded to estimate what it would cost to earn the\r\n$3,400,000 just mentioned. He began with the total working expenses,\r\nin 1866, of the four leading companies, namely $1,650,000. He stated\r\nthat the companies had said that if permitted to consolidate, they\r\ncould reduce expenses by $275,000 a year. But if the Post Office were\r\nto take over the telegraphs, it would reduce the expenses by more\r\nthan the last mentioned sum, for it could use the existing Post Office\r\nbuildings, the existing staff, and so forth. Deducting numerous other\r\nitems representing expenses that the companies had incurred on account\r\nof the operation of foreign cables and the conduct of other forms of\r\nbusiness that the Post Office would discontinue, Mr. Scudamore reached\r\nthe conclusion that the Post Office, in 1866, could have operated at a\r\ntotal cost of $1,325,000 the plants of the four telegraph companies.\r\n\r\nMr. Scudamore added 10 per cent. to the last mentioned sum, in order\r\nto cover the cost of maintaining and operating the extensions that\r\nthe State proposed to make at a cost of $1,000,000. He took 10 per\r\ncent. because $1,000,000 was 1/11 or 1/12 of the capital invested in\r\nthe plants of the telegraph companies. That raised to $1,457,500 Mr.\r\nScudamore's estimate of the cost of operating the telegraphs on the\r\nsupposition of a business of 7,500,000 messages.\r\n\r\nMr. Scudamore then allowed 33 per cent. or $437,250, for the assumed\r\nincrease in the number of messages from 7,500,000 to 11,650,000.\r\nHe said the Post Office might safely assume that it could increase\r\nits business by 55 per cent. at an increase of 33 per cent. in the\r\noperating expenses, since the Electric and International Telegraph\r\nCompany recently had increased its business by 105 per cent. at an\r\nincrease of 33 per cent. in the operating expenses. Mr. Scudamore's\r\nconclusion was that the Post Office could carry 11,650,000 messages,\r\nyielding an income of $3,400,000, at a cost of $1,895,000, thus\r\nobtaining a net revenue of $1,505,000.\r\n\r\nTo that sum must be added the net revenue to be obtained from the\r\ncarriage of messages for the newspaper press, $60,000; and $225,000\r\nto be obtained from the rental of the State's cables to the several\r\nforeign cable companies. Thus Mr. Scudamore counted on a maximum net\r\nrevenue of $1,790,000.\r\n\r\nBy similar reasoning, under the supposition that the total number\r\nof messages should not exceed 7,500,000, Mr. Scudamore arrived at\r\na minimum estimated net revenue of $1,015,000. Taking the average\r\nof the two foregoing estimates, he said the Government \"might with\r\nalmost entire certainty rely upon a net revenue within a range of from\r\n$1,000,000 to $1,800,000, the mean of which was $1,400,000.\" That was\r\nfor the first year; in the subsequent years the net revenue would\r\nincrease rapidly. He said: \"It is the experience of all people who\r\nhave worked a large business of this kind that the cost does not by\r\nany means increase in proportion to the increase of business; you can\r\nalways do a greater amount of business at a less proportionate cost\r\nthan you can do a smaller amount.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Goschen repeatedly asked Mr. Scudamore whether he would stand by\r\nhis estimates, and whether he deemed them moderate, adding that the\r\nSelect Committee was taking the matter almost exclusively on his\r\n[Mr. Scudamore's] evidence. Mr. Goschen always received the strongest\r\nassurances that the Committee might rely on the estimates submitted.[58]\r\n\r\nMr. Scudamore's predictions as to the growth of traffic that might be\r\nexpected from the great increase in the facilities for telegraphing,\r\nand from the reduction of the charges by fully one-half, turned out to\r\nbe brilliant indeed. They were fully realized. The number of messages\r\nincreased from about 6,500,000 in 1869, to 9,850,000 in 1870-71, to\r\n19,253,000 in 1874-75, and to 26,547,000 in 1879-1880.[59]\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Scudamore's predictions as to the net revenue to be obtained\r\nfrom the State telegraphs turned out to be appalling blunders. In only\r\nthirteen out of thirty-six years, from 1870-71 to 1905-06, did the net\r\nrevenue reach Mr. Scudamore's minimum estimate; in only two of those\r\nthirteen years did it reach the maximum estimate; and in only seven of\r\nthe thirteen years did it reach the average estimate. In the period\r\n1892-93 to 1905-06, the operating expenses aggregated $231,196,000,\r\nwhile the gross receipts aggregated $229,761,000. In the latter sum\r\nare included $8,552,000, the proceeds of the royalties paid the\r\nGovernment by the British National Telephone Company for the privilege\r\nof conducting the telephone business in competition with the State\r\ntelegraphs.[60] If that sum be excluded from the postal telegraph gross\r\nrevenues, as not having been earned by the telegraphs, it will be found\r\nthat in the period, 1892-93 to 1905-06, the operating expenses exceeded\r\nthe gross revenue by $9,987,000.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Operating Expenses under-estimated by one-half_]\r\n\r\nMr. Scudamore, in 1869, predicted that the operating expenses would\r\nbe 51 per cent. to 56 per cent. of the gross revenue, in the first\r\nyear of the working of the telegraphs by the Post Office; and that\r\nthey would continue to be correspondingly low. In 1875, a Committee\r\nappointed by the Treasury reported that in consequence of the great\r\nextension of facilities effected since 1870, \"it would be difficult\r\nfor the Government to work the Telegraph Service as cheaply as did\r\nthe Companies, but a reasonable expectation might be entertained that\r\nthe expenses might be kept within 70 per cent. or 75 per cent. of the\r\ngross revenue. That would leave a margin sufficient to pay the interest\r\non the debt incurred in purchasing the telegraphs.\"[61] As a matter\r\nof fact, the operating expenses only once have come within the limits\r\nfixed by the Committee of 1875; and at the close of 1900-01, they had\r\naveraged 92.5 per cent.[62] Here again, the telephone royalties are\r\nincluded in the gross receipts.\r\n\r\nOn March 31, 1906, the capital invested in the telegraphs was\r\n$84,812,000.[63] To raise that capital, the Government had sold\r\n$54,300,000 three per cent. bonds at an average price of about\r\n92.3;[64] and for the rest, the Government had drawn upon the current\r\nrevenue raised by taxation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Aggregate Telegraph Deficit_]\r\n\r\nThe net revenue earned by the telegraphs covered the interest on\r\nthe bonds outstanding, in 1870-71, and in the years 1879-80 to\r\n1883-84. On March 31, 1906, the sums annually paid by the Government\r\nby way of interest that had not been earned by the telegraphs, had\r\naggregated $22,530,000, or 26.5 per cent. of the capital invested in\r\nthe telegraphs.[65] Upon the sums invested since 1874, aggregating\r\n$34,534,000, the Government has received no interest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Parliament Responsible for Deficits_]\r\n\r\nThe statement is commonly made, and widely accepted, that the financial\r\nfailure of the State telegraphs is due to the excessive price paid for\r\nthe plant. But that statement overlooks two facts: that since 1892-93\r\nthe telegraphs have not earned operating expenses; and that in 1880-81\r\nthe telegraphs became abundantly able to earn the interest even upon\r\ntheir immoderate capitalization.[66] The statement in question also\r\noverlooks the fact that the telegraphs easily could have maintained the\r\nposition reached in 1880-81, had not the House of Commons taken the\r\nreins out of the hands of the successive Governments of the day. The\r\nHouse of Commons after 1881 fixed the wages and salaries to be paid\r\nthe Government telegraph employees in accordance with the political\r\npressure those employees were able to bring, not in accordance with\r\nthe market value of the services rendered by the employees. The House\r\nof Commons also reduced the tariff on telegrams from 24 cents for\r\n20 words, to 12 cents for 12 words. It took that course against the\r\nprotests of the Government of the day, and cut deep into the margin of\r\nprofit of the telegraph department.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the House of Commons after 1880-81 took the reins out\r\nof the hands of the successive Governments of the day, in no way\r\ndiminished Mr. Scudamore's responsibility for the appalling errors\r\ninto which he fell when he forecast the financial outcome of the\r\nnationalization of the telegraphs. Mr. Leeman, of the Parliamentary\r\nSelect Committee of 1868, expressly asked Mr. Scudamore: \"You do not\r\nthink there is any fear of the cost being increased by the salaries\r\nbeing much increased under the management of the Post Office?\" Mr.\r\nScudamore without hesitation replied in the negative, though he had\r\njust stated that in the Post Office and in all Government departments\r\nthe pay of the lower grades of employees was somewhat higher than it\r\nwas in commercial and industrial life.[67] Moreover, Mr. Scudamore, as\r\none of the two chief executive officers of the Post Office, must have\r\nbeen aware that the Government was neither perfectly free to promote\r\nmen according to their merit, and irrespective of length of service,\r\nnor free to discharge men who were comparatively inefficient and\r\nlax in the discharge of their duties. He must have known that those\r\ndisabilities made it impossible for the Post Office to work as cheaply\r\nas private enterprise worked.\r\n\r\nAs for the House of Commons forcing on the Government the 12 cent\r\nrate for messages of 12 words, that action was due largely to the\r\nexpectations raised by Mr. Scudamore himself in 1868 and 1869, that the\r\nnationalization of the telegraphs would soon give the public a twelve\r\ncent rate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Mr. W. S. Jevons' Disillusionment_]\r\n\r\nMr. W. Stanley Jevons, the eminent statistician and economist, who,\r\nin 1866 to 1869, had warmly supported the proposal to nationalize the\r\ntelegraphs, in 1875 pointed out that while the postal telegraph traffic\r\nhad increased 81 per cent. in the period 1870 to 1874, the operating\r\nexpenses had increased 110 per cent. He said: \"The case is all the more\r\nhopeless, since the introduction of the wonderful invention of duplex\r\ntelegraphy has doubled at a stroke, and with very little cost, the\r\ncarrying power of many of the wires.\"[68]\r\n\r\nIn 1870 each wire afforded one channel for communication; in 1895 it\r\nafforded two channels under the Duplex system, four channels under\r\nthe Quadruplex system, and six channels under the Multiplex system.\r\nIn 1870 the maximum speed per minute was 60 to 80 words. In 1895 the\r\nfixed standard of speed for certain circuits was 400 words, while a\r\nspeed of 600 words was possible of attainment. The \"repeaters\" used for\r\nstrengthening the current on long circuits also were greatly improved\r\nafter 1870.[69]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[48] _Report by Mr. Scudamore on the Reorganization of the Telegraph\r\nSystem of the United Kingdom_, January, 1871.\r\n\r\nNumber of telegraph offices before and after the transfer of the\r\ntelegraphs to the State:\r\n\r\n  +================+========+========+\r\n  |                |  1869  |  1870  |\r\n  +----------------+--------+--------+\r\n  |London          |   95   |  334   |\r\n  +----------------+--------+--------+\r\n  |Birmingham      |   10   |   14   |\r\n  +----------------+--------+--------+\r\n  |Edinburgh       |    9   |   15   |\r\n  +----------------+--------+--------+\r\n  |Leeds           |   10   |   18   |\r\n  +----------------+--------+--------+\r\n  |Glasgow         |   13   |   19   |\r\n  +----------------+--------+--------+\r\n  |Manchester      |   21   |   32   |\r\n  +================+========+========+\r\n\r\nThis table does not indicate fully the expense incurred by the State\r\nin providing local telegraph systems.

Mr. Gladstone, Leader\r\n     of the Opposition, assents to enfranchisement, but expresses\r\n     grave apprehensions of evil results.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most extraordinary of the numerous astounding episodes in\r\nconnection with the nationalization of the telegraphs was the fact that\r\nin the debates in the House of Commons was not even raised the question\r\nof possible danger arising from increasing enormously the number of\r\ncivil servants. That is the more astounding, since, in 1867 and 1868,\r\nprominent men in both political parties had grave misgivings as to\r\nthe future relations between the State and its employees, even though\r\nthose employees who were in the Customs Department, the Inland Revenue\r\nDepartment, and the Post Office were at the time disfranchised.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Mr. Disraeli on Civil Servants_]\r\n\r\nIn July, 1867, while the House of Commons was passing the\r\n\"Representation of the People Bill,\" Sir Harry Verney, a private\r\nmember, moved the addition of a clause to enable public officers\r\nconnected with the collection of the revenue to vote at elections.[70]\r\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Disraeli, asked the House not\r\nto accept the Amendment. He said: \"He wished also to recall to the\r\nrecollection of the committee a Treasury Minute which had been placed\r\non the table, in which Minute the Government had drawn attention to the\r\nimpropriety and impolicy of officers in those branches of the public\r\nservice to which the honorable baronet [Sir Harry Verney] had referred,\r\nexercising their influence over Members of Parliament, in order to urge\r\nupon the Government an increase of their salaries. Even at the present\r\ntime an influence was exerted which must be viewed with great jealousy,\r\nand every Government, however constituted, would find it necessary to\r\nuse its utmost influence in restricting overtures of that description.\r\nBut what would be the position of affairs if these persons--so numerous\r\na body--were invested with the franchise. From the experience of what\r\nwas passing in this city--and he wished merely to intimate, and not to\r\ndwell upon the circumstance--he was led to believe the result would\r\nbe that there would be an organization illegitimately to increase the\r\nremuneration they received for their services--a remuneration which,\r\nin his opinion, was based upon a just estimate. He did not deny that\r\nthe class referred to by the honorable baronet were entirely worthy of\r\npublic confidence, but the conferring the franchise upon them would\r\nplace them in a new position, and would introduce into public life new\r\ninfluences which would not be of a beneficial character. He trusted\r\ntherefore that the committee would not sanction the proposal of the\r\nhonorable baronet.\"\r\n\r\nThe amendment was lost; and in the following year, 1868, Mr. Monk, a\r\nprivate member, carried against the Government of the day, a bill to\r\nenfranchise the revenue officers.[71]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Chancellor of the Exchequer on Civil Servants_]\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. G. W. Hunt, said he felt bound\r\nto move that the bill be committed this day three months--_i. e._,\r\nbe rejected. He said it was an anomaly in the laws that the dockyard\r\nlaborers were not disfranchised. \"If the matter were inquired into\r\ncalmly and dispassionately, he was not at all sure that a good case\r\nmight not be made out for affixing to them the same disability that\r\nis now attached to the revenue officers. The fact did not at all tend\r\nto the purity or the impartiality of electors in places where many of\r\nthese men were employed, and strenuous efforts were made by members\r\nrepresenting them to increase the privileges of the dockyard men and\r\nthe number of persons employed, which did not tend to economy or the\r\nproper husbanding of the national resources. Continual applications\r\nwere made by these gentlemen [the employees in the Revenue Departments]\r\nrespecting their position and salaries, and these applications had of\r\nlate years taken a very peculiar form, being not merely made through\r\nthe heads of departments, or by simple memorial to the treasury,\r\nbut in the form of resolutions at public meetings held by them, and\r\ncommunications to Members of Parliament by delegates appointed to\r\nrepresent their interests. He put it to the House, whether, in the\r\ncircumstances supposed, the influence possessed by them would not\r\nbe very considerably increased, and whether the Government of the\r\nday would not have far greater difficulty in administering these\r\ndepartments with respect to the position and salaries of the officers\r\nconcerned, if the measure were carried.\"[72]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Mr. Gladstone's Warning_]\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone said: \"The suggestion he would make would be that\r\nParliament should give the vote, and, at the same time, leave it in\r\nthe discretion of the Government of the day to inhibit any of these\r\nofficers from taking any part in politics beyond giving their simple\r\nvote.... Again, before they proceeded to lay down the principle of\r\ngeneral enfranchisement, one thing to be considered was the very\r\npeculiar relations between the revenue officers and the Members of\r\nthat House. There it was necessary to speak plainly. He was not afraid\r\nof Government influence in that matter, nor of an influence in favor\r\nof one political party or another; but he owned that he had some\r\napprehension of what might be called class influence in that House,\r\nwhich in his opinion was the great reproach of the Reformed Parliament,\r\nas he believed history would record. Whether they were going to emerge\r\ninto a new state of things in which class influence would be weaker he\r\nknew not; but that class influence had been in many things evil and a\r\nscandal to them, especially for the last fifteen or twenty years; and\r\nhe was fearful of its increase in consequence of the possession of the\r\nfranchise, through the power which men who, as members of a regular\r\nservice, were already organized, might bring to bear on Members of\r\nParliament. What, he asked, was the Civil Service of this country?\r\nIt was a service in which there was a great deal of complaint of\r\ninadequate pay, of slow promotion, and all the rest of it. But, at the\r\nsame time, it was a service which there was an extraordinary desire to\r\nget into. And whose privilege was it to regulate that desire? That of\r\nthe Members of that House....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[70] _Hansard's Parliamentary Debates_, July 4, 1867, p. 1,032 and\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\n[71] _Hansard's Parliamentary Debates_, June 10, 1868, p. 1,352 and\r\nfollowing; June 12, p. 1,533 and following; and June 30, 1,868, p.\r\n390 and following.

Northcote, Chancellor of the Exchequer in Mr.\r\n     Disraeli's Ministry of 1874 to 1880, is disillusioned. The\r\n     State telegraphs become self-supporting in 1879-80. The House\r\n     of Commons, under the leadership of Dr. Cameron, M. P. for\r\n     Glasgow, overrides the Ministry and cuts the tariff almost in\r\n     two. In 1890-91 the State telegraphs would again have become\r\n     self-supporting, had not the House of Commons, under pressure\r\n     from the civil service unions, increased wages and salaries.\r\n     The necessity of making money is the only effective incentive\r\n     to sound management.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe consideration of the reasons for the financial failure of the\r\nState telegraphs may begin with the discussion of the effect of the\r\nbuilding of unremunerative extensions. In 1873 the Treasury Department\r\nforced the Post Office Department to abandon the doctrine that every\r\nplace with a money order issuing post office was of right entitled\r\nto a telegraph office. The treasury in that year adopted the policy\r\nof demanding a guarantee from private individuals whenever it did\r\nnot care to assume the risk of a telegraph office failing to be\r\nself-supporting.[73] The new policy, of course, applied only to places\r\nnot yet provided with telegraphic service, for the withdrawal of an\r\nestablished service would have led \"to an immense amount of public\r\ninconvenience and agitation that the Government would have been unable\r\nto resist.\"[74]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Sir S. Northcote's Disillusionment_]\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the policy of requiring guarantees in order to check the\r\npressure brought by the House of Commons for additional telegraphic\r\nservices, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Stafford Northcote,\r\nin 1875, said: \"The Government cannot give the answer that private\r\ncompanies could, and I am sure did, give. This is a point worthy of\r\nconsideration, not so much in regard to the telegraph service itself,\r\nin which we are now fairly embarked, and of which we must make the\r\nbest we can, as in reference to suggestions of acquisitions of other\r\nforms of property, and the conduct of other kinds of business, in which\r\nI hope the House will never be led to embark without very carefully\r\nweighing the results of this remarkable experiment.\"[75]\r\n\r\nThe guarantee in question, which had to be given by private\r\nindividuals, covered: the annual working expenses; interest on the\r\ncapital investment; sinking fund payments which should repay in seven\r\nyears the capital invested; and a margin for certain contingencies.[76]\r\nIn August, 1891, was abolished the provision requiring a guarantee of\r\nthe repayment of the capital in seven years.[77] At the same time, the\r\nlocal governments were authorized to give the guarantee that continued\r\nto be required.[78] In 1897, upon the occasion of Her late Majesty's\r\nDiamond Jubilee, the Treasury authorized the Post Office to assume\r\none-half of the burden of non-paying telegraphic services; and since\r\nMay 1, 1906, the Post Office assumes two-thirds of that burden.[79]\r\n\r\nThe guarantees demanded after 1873 proved an effective check upon\r\nlog-rolling. For example, in 1876, Catrine, in Ayrshire, with a\r\npopulation of 2,000, still was without telegraph service, while\r\nTarbolton, in Ayrshire, population 500, had acquired such service\r\nprevious to 1873.[80] In the period from 1874 to 1878 the number of\r\npostal telegraph offices increased only from 3,756 to 3,761.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this subject, it is necessary to warn the reader\r\nagainst misleading tables published in several official documents,\r\nand purporting to show that non-paying offices rapidly became\r\nself-supporting.[81]\r\n\r\nThose tables are constructed on the basis of including in the cost\r\nof telegraph offices only the allowance to the local postmaster for\r\ntelegraph work, and the cost of maintaining the instruments in the\r\noffice, and of excluding the cost of maintaining the wire, the cost\r\nof additional force required at the central station in London and at\r\nthe district centres because of the large number of outlying branches,\r\nas well as the interest on the capital invested. Those omissions led\r\nthe Treasury Committee of 1875 to say: \"We fear the full cost of\r\nworking these numerous and unremunerative offices is not realized\r\n[appreciated].\" In 1888, Mr. C. H. B. Patey, Third Secretary to the\r\nPost Office, was asked by a Select Committee of Parliament: \"Where\r\nyou have established telegraph offices at money order offices under\r\nguarantee from individuals interested, do you find that eventually\r\nthese offices pay?\" He replied: \"No; in exceedingly few instances do\r\nthey pay. The guarantee has continued, and after seven years we have\r\ngot a fresh guarantee in order to continue the office.\"[82] Mr. Patey's\r\ntestimony is corroborated by the continued, and successful, agitation\r\nof the House of Commons for the reduction of the guarantee demanded by\r\nthe Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe second reason for the financial failure of the State telegraphs is,\r\nthat while the precipitate reductions made in the rates charged to the\r\npublic led to a great increase in the number of messages transmitted,\r\nthat very increase of business was accompanied by such augmented\r\noperating expenses, that some years elapsed before the reduced average\r\nmargin of profit per message carried sufficed to pay the interest on\r\nthe immoderate capitalization of the State telegraphs. The increase in\r\nthe operating expenses was in part inevitable; in part it was due to\r\nthe waste inherent in all business operations conducted by executive\r\nofficers who hold office, either at the pleasure of legislative bodies\r\nelected by manhood suffrage, or at the pleasure of large bodies of\r\nvoters.\r\n\r\nIn 1876, Mr. C. H. B. Patey, Principal Clerk in the Post Office\r\nDepartment, stated that the average of the operating expenses per\r\ntelegraphic message transmitted was 16 cents to 18 cents.[83] At\r\nthat time, with a traffic of 21,000,000 messages a year, and average\r\nreceipts per message of 28 cents, the net revenue of the telegraphs was\r\n$1,060,000, while the interest on the bonds outstanding was $1,475,000.\r\nIn 1879-80, with a traffic of 24,500,000 messages, average receipts\r\nper message of 26 cents, the telegraphs yielded a net revenue of\r\n$1,667,000, while the interest on the bonds outstanding was $1,632,000.\r\nAnd in 1880-81, with a traffic of 27,300,000 messages, the net revenue\r\nrose to $2,257,000, while the interest on the bonds outstanding\r\nremained at $1,632,000. A large part of that improvement was due to a\r\ndiminution in the waste with which the telegraphs had been conducted\r\nin 1874 to 1878. The nature and the extent of that waste are indicated\r\nin the fact that the number of clerks, telegraphists, and subordinate\r\nengineers was reduced from 6,783 in 1876, to 6,220 in 1880,[84] at the\r\nsame time that the number of telegraph offices was increased from 3,741\r\nto 3,929, and the number of messages was increased from 21,000,000 to\r\n24,500,000.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Telegraphs become self-supporting_]\r\n\r\nIn 1880-81, the telegraphs earned 3.25 per cent. on $69,455,000,[85]\r\nwhich was $16,180,000 in excess of the total capital invested in them.\r\nUnder conditions which shall be described on a subsequent page, the\r\nGovernment, \"very much at the instance of the House of Commons,\"[86]\r\nraised wages and salaries, so that, in the period from 1880-81 to\r\n1884-85, the expenses on account of salaries and wages increased\r\n$1,100,325, while the gross receipts increased only $752,635. In\r\n1884-85, the net revenue sufficed to pay the interest at 3.25 per cent.\r\non $45,710,000 only.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, on March 29, 1883, the House of Commons had carried\r\nagainst the Government of the day, the resolution of Dr. Cameron,\r\nMember of Parliament from Glasgow: \"That the time has arrived when the\r\nminimum charge for Inland Postal Telegrams should be reduced to 12\r\ncents.\"[87] Dr. Cameron said: \"He brought forward the motion--and he\r\ndid so last year[88]--because he was absolutely opposed to the taxation\r\nof telegrams [_i. e._, to raising more revenue from the telegraphs\r\nthan was requisite to paying the interest on the bonds outstanding];\r\nand he believed that taxation could be levied in no other manner that\r\nwould be so prejudicial to the commerce, intercourse, and convenience\r\nof the country. At the present moment there was practically no taxation\r\nof telegrams, or, at all events, the principle of the taxation of\r\ntelegrams had not been affirmed. The surplus revenue [above the\r\ninterest on the debt outstanding] earned up to the present time had\r\nbeen so small that it was impossible by sacrificing it to confer any\r\nsubstantial advantage upon the public. But the telegraph revenue was\r\nincreasing; and it appeared to him that they had now arrived at a\r\npoint where a remission of taxation must be made in the shape of extra\r\nfacilities [_i. e._, reduced charges] for the public, or the vicious\r\nprinciple of the taxation of telegrams for the purpose of revenue must\r\nbe affirmed. They had, it might be contended, not yet exactly arrived\r\nat that point, but they were remarkably near it; and his object in\r\nbringing forward the motion from year to year had been to afford the\r\nGovernment no excuse for allowing the point to be passed, but to bring\r\nup the subject every year; and the moment it was admitted that a change\r\ncould be made without loss to the taxpayers he should ask the House to\r\nindicate its opinions that the change might be made.... He maintained\r\nthat the principle of taxing telegrams was most erroneous. It was one\r\nof the worst taxes on knowledge[89]--a tax on economy, on time, and\r\non the production of wealth. Instead of maintaining a price which was\r\nprohibitory not only to the working classes but also to the middle\r\nclasses, they ought to take every means to encourage telegraphy. They\r\nought to educate the rising generation to it; and he would suggest to\r\nthe Government that the composing of telegrams would form a useful part\r\nof the education in our board schools.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Childers, \"hoped the House\r\nwould not agree to the motion\" even if it were ready to accept Dr.\r\nCameron's estimate that the immediate reduction in the net revenue\r\nwould not exceed $850,000. \"He had heard with surprise in the course\r\nof the debate some of the statements which had been made in regard to\r\nthe unimportance of large items of expenditure [and of revenue]; and he\r\nwas all the more surprised when he remembered the great anxiety which\r\nhad been expressed during the present session in regard to the Public\r\nExpenditure, and the care which ought to be taken over it.\"[90]\r\n\r\nDr. Cameron, in the course of his speech in 1882, quoted a statement\r\nrecently made by Mr. Fawcett, Postmaster General, to the effect that\r\nthere was an average of 80,000 telegrams a day for 5,600 offices, or\r\n14 telegrams per office. The representative from Glasgow added: \"The\r\nstate of things which they now had, therefore amounted to this--that\r\nfrom each telegraph office was sent a number of messages which afforded\r\na little over half an hour's work per day for the operator. It would,\r\ntherefore, at once be seen that there was ample room for increased\r\nbusiness, without any increase of expenditure.\"[91] The foregoing\r\nargument overlooked the fact that the wires between the large cities\r\nwere being worked to something like their full capacity; and that the\r\nlow average of 14 messages per office was due solely to the existence\r\nof hundreds of offices in small places that had very little traffic.\r\nAnd shortly after the House of Commons had passed Dr. Cameron's\r\nresolution, in 1883, against the protest of the Government, the\r\nTreasury authorized the Post Office to spend $2,500,000 in putting up\r\n15,000 miles of additional wires, and in otherwise preparing for the\r\ngreat increase in business that would arise between the larger towns in\r\nconsequence of the reduction of the tariff.[92] And by July 5, 1885,\r\nthree months before the date set for putting into force the reduced\r\nrate, the Post Office had engaged 1,202 additional telegraphists\r\nand learners,[93] to assist in doing the business which Dr. Cameron\r\nin 1882, had said could be done \"without any great increase of\r\nexpenditure.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Tariff is cut almost in two_]\r\n\r\nOn March 30, 1885, Mr. Shaw-Lefevre, Postmaster General, brought in a\r\nbill to give effect to Dr. Cameron's resolution of March 29, 1883.[94]\r\nThe measure provided for a rate of 12 cents for not exceeding 12\r\nwords, address to be counted, and one cent for each additional word.\r\nThe Postmaster General began by reminding the House of Commons that\r\nDr. Cameron's resolution had been carried against the Government, and\r\nby a considerable majority. That the Post Office has spent $2,500,000\r\nin preparing for the increase of business anticipated from the 12\r\ncent tariff. That the loss of net revenue was estimated at $900,000\r\nfor the first year; and that it would take four years to recover\r\nthat loss. That since Dr. Cameron's resolution had been passed, the\r\nfinancial position of the telegraph department had grown \"decidedly\r\nworse,\" the net revenue having fallen from $2,200,000 to $1,275,000,\r\nthe latter sum yielding barely 2.5 per cent. on the capital invested\r\nin the telegraphs, $55,000,000. Mr. Shaw-Lefevre said the decrease in\r\nthe net revenue had been due \"to the very considerable additions to\r\nthe salaries of the telegraphists and other officers made two or three\r\nyears ago very much at the instance of honorable Members of the House,\r\nand which Mr. Fawcett [the then Postmaster General] considered to be\r\nabsolutely necessary,\" and also to increased cost of maintenance[95]\r\narising from the necessity of replacing worn-out plant. The Postmaster\r\nGeneral also drew attention to the fact that a new and dangerous factor\r\nhad appeared: the competition of the telephone.[96]\r\n\r\nThe Bill became law; and the 12 cent tariff went into effect on\r\nOctober 1, 1885, the close of the first half of the fiscal year\r\n1885-86. The number of messages jumped from 33,000,000 to 50,000,000,\r\nwhile the net revenue dropped from $1,370,000 to $440,000. In the next\r\nthree years, 1887-88 to 1889-90, the number of messages increased to\r\n62,400,000, and the net revenue rose to $1,451,000, or within $431,000\r\nof the interest on the capital invested, $62,748,000. In the following\r\nyear, 1890-91, the messages continued to increase at the rate at which\r\nthey had increased in the three preceding years, and the net revenue\r\nwould once more have sufficed to pay the interest on the capital\r\ninvested, had the operating expenses not been swollen by increases in\r\nwages and salaries granted under pressure brought by the telegraph\r\nemployees upon the House of Commons. The raising of salaries and wages\r\ncontinued through the subsequent years; and in the thirteen years\r\n1893-94 to 1905-06, the State telegraphs have earned the operating\r\nexpenses in five years only.[97]\r\n\r\nIn 1888, the _Select Committee on Revenue Departments Estimates_\r\nreported as follows: \"Your Committee are of the opinion that the\r\nreasons urged against treating the Post Office as a commercial business\r\nare not applicable in anything like the same degree to the Telegraph\r\nDepartment; and that the increasing annual deficit in the accounts of\r\nthe latter cannot be viewed otherwise than with grave concern. Looking\r\nto the increasing costliness of the service as a whole, and to the\r\nconstant pressure upon it of demands for increased and unprofitable\r\nexpenditure, your committee deem it their duty to call attention to\r\nthe fact that the Department of the Postmaster General, in all its\r\nbranches, is a vast Government business, which is most likely to\r\ncontinue to be conducted satisfactorily, if it should also continue\r\nto be conducted with a view to profit [beyond the payment of interest\r\non the debt outstanding], as one of the revenue yielding departments\r\nof the State. Excessive expenditure appears to your committee to be\r\nsooner or later inevitable in a great Government business which is not\r\nadministered with a view to an ultimate profit to the State.\"\r\n\r\n  =========+============+============++=========+============+===========\r\n    Year   |  Number of |Net Revenue,||  Year   |  Number of |Net Revenue\r\n           |  Messages  |      $     ||         |  Messages  |      $\r\n  ---------+------------+------------++---------+------------+-----------\r\n   1884-85 | 33,278,000 |  1,371,000 || 1894-95 | 71,589,000 |    -50,000\r\n   1885-86 | 39,146,000 |    839,000 || 1895-96 | 78,840,000 |    646,000\r\n   1886-87 | 50,244,000 |    442,000 || 1896-97 | 79,423,000 |    678,000\r\n   1887-88 | 53,403,000 |    614,000 || 1899-00 | 90,415,000 |    326,000\r\n   1888-89 | 57,765,000 |  1,061,000 || 1901-02 | 90,432,000 |   -848,000\r\n   1889-90 | 62,403,000 |  1,451,000 || 1902-03 | 92,471,000 |   -548,000\r\n   1890-91 | 66,409,000 |  1,259,000 || 1903-04 | 89,997,000 | -1,530,000\r\n   1891-92 | 69,685,000 |    922,000 || 1904-05 | 88,969,000 |   -917,000\r\n   1892-93 | 69,908,000 |     94,000 || 1905-06 | 89,478,000 |    -63,500\r\n  =========+============+============++=========+============+===========\r\n\r\nThe minus sign denotes an excess of operating expenses over receipts.\r\n\r\nHad the House of Commons permitted the successive Governments of the\r\nday to act upon the doctrine contained in the foregoing quotation, the\r\nState telegraphs would have been self-supporting ever since the year\r\n1880-81.

Mr.\r\n     Scudamore gives the newspaper press a tariff which he deems\r\n     unprofitable. Estimates of the loss involved in transmitting\r\n     press messages, made by responsible persons in the period from\r\n     1876 to 1900. The State telegraphs subsidize betting on horse\r\n     races.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding with the further discussion of the intervention of\r\nthe House of Commons in the details of the administration of the State\r\ntelegraphs, it is necessary to review briefly the tariff on messages\r\nfor the newspaper press.\r\n\r\nBefore the telegraphs had been acquired by the State, the telegraph\r\ncompanies maintained a press bureau which supplied the newspapers with\r\nreports of the debates in Parliament, foreign news, general news, a\r\ncertain amount of London financial and commercial intelligence, and\r\nthe more important sporting news. While Parliament was in session,\r\nthe messages in question averaged about 6,000 words a day; during the\r\nremainder of the year they averaged about 4,000 words daily. The annual\r\nsubscription charges for the aforesaid services ranged from $750 to\r\n$1,250. Before the Select Committee of 1868, the representatives of\r\nthe newspapers asserted that those subscription charges yielded the\r\ntelegraph companies, on an average, 8 cents per 100 words. They further\r\nasserted that the telegraph companies ascribed 62.5 per cent. of the\r\ncost of the press bureau to the transmission of the news; and 37.5 per\r\ncent. to the collecting and editing of the news.[98] But neither the\r\nrepresentatives of the press, nor the Select Committee itself, called\r\nany representatives of the telegraph companies to testify upon these\r\nlatter points.\r\n\r\nThe subscribers to the companies' press bureau service also were\r\nallowed to send messages at one-half the rate charged to the general\r\npublic; and in case the same newspaper message was sent to several\r\nnewspapers in the same town, the charge for each address after the\r\nfirst one was 25 per cent. of the sum charged the first addressee.\r\nBy coöperation, therefore, the newspapers in the larger towns were\r\nable to obtain considerable reductions from the initial charge,\r\nwhich, as already stated, was 50 per cent. of the tariff charged the\r\ngeneral public.[99] Apparently, however, little use was made of these\r\nprivileges. In 1868, for instance, the subscriptions to the press\r\nbureau aggregated $150,000, whereas the sums paid for messages to\r\nindividual newspapers aggregated only $10,000.[100]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Newspapers' Grievance_]\r\n\r\nThe newspaper proprietors admitted that the charges for the press\r\nbureau service were entirely reasonable; but they desired to organize\r\ntheir own press bureaux on the ground that they were the better judges\r\nof what news the public wanted. Since the telegraph companies would not\r\ngive up their press bureau, the newspaper proprietors joined in the\r\nagitation for the nationalization of the telegraphs.[101]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Government began to negotiate with the telegraph\r\ncompanies for the purchase of their plants, the newspaper proprietors\r\norganized a committee to protect their interests and to represent them\r\nbefore the Select Committee to which had been referred the Electric\r\nTelegraphs Bill of 1868. That Bill had said that the tariff was to be\r\nuniform, irrespective of distance, and was not to exceed 24 cents for\r\n20 words, address not to be counted. It had said nothing on the subject\r\nof the tariff to be charged to the newspaper press.\r\n\r\nOn May 15, 1868, Mr. Scudamore had written the Committee of the\r\nnewspaper proprietors: \"As a matter of course the Post Office would\r\nnot undertake to collect news any more than it would undertake to\r\nwrite letters for the public, but the news being collected, it could,\r\nand I submit, ought, to transmit it at rates at least as low as those\r\nnow charged, and which though they are unquestionably low, are still\r\nbelieved to yield the companies a considerable profit.... It seems to\r\nme, indeed, that the transmission of news to the press throughout the\r\nUnited Kingdom should be regarded as a matter of national importance\r\nand that the charge of such transmission should include no greater\r\nmargin of profit than would suffice to make the service fairly\r\nself-supporting.\"[102]\r\n\r\nThereupon the newspaper proprietors demanded: \"That the maximum rate\r\nfor the transmission of telegraphic messages [for newspapers] should\r\nnot exceed that which is now paid by each individual proprietor [as a\r\nsubscriber to the companies' press bureau], which is, for transmission,\r\nexclusive of the cost of collection, 4 cents per 100 words.\"[103] This\r\ndemand assumed that the companies' charge of 8 cents per 100 words was\r\nremunerative; that it was made up of two separable parts: a charge for\r\ntransmission, and a charge for collecting and editing; and that the\r\ncharge ascribed to transmission still would remain remunerative even\r\nafter the charge ascribed to collecting and editing had been withdrawn.\r\nUpon none of these several points were the officers of the telegraph\r\ncompanies asked to testify, the statements of the newspaper proprietors\r\nbeing allowed to stand unsupported.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Mr. Scudamore yields to the newspapers_]\r\n\r\nIn order to insure the payment of an average sum of 4 cents or 5 cents\r\nper 100 words, the newspaper proprietors proposed that messages be\r\ntransmitted for the newspapers \"at rates not exceeding 24 cents for\r\nevery 100 words transmitted at night, and at rates not exceeding 24\r\ncents for every 75 words transmitted by day, to a single address, with\r\nan additional charge of 4 cents for every 100 words, or for every 75\r\nwords, as the case may be, of the same telegram so transmitted to every\r\nadditional address.\" By way of compromise, Mr. Scudamore proposed a\r\ncharge of 24 cents for 75 words or 100 words for each separate town\r\nto which each message might be sent, and the limitation of the 4 cent\r\ncopy rate to copies delivered by hand in the same town. Mr. Scudamore,\r\nhowever, withdrew that proposal, and accepted the proposition of the\r\nnewspaper proprietors, which became the law. It is needless to add that\r\nthe opposition of the newspaper press to the Bill of 1868 would have\r\ndelayed the passage of that Bill even more than any opposition on the\r\npart of the telegraph companies and railway companies could have done.\r\nIndeed, it is probable, that the newspaper press could have defeated\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\nIn 1875 the Treasury appointed a \"_Committee to investigate the Causes\r\nof the Increased Cost of the Telegraphic Service since the Acquisition\r\nof the Telegraphs by the State_.\" That committee consisted of three\r\nprominent officers taken from the Post Office Department and other\r\ndepartments of State. Upon the newspaper tariff fixed by the Act of\r\n1868, the Committee reported: \"The consequences of such a system must\r\nbe obvious to every one. Even at ordinary times the wires are always\r\nlargely occupied with press work, and at extraordinary times they\r\nare absolutely flooded with this most unremunerative traffic, which\r\nnot only fills the wires unduly to the exclusion of better paying\r\nmatter, but necessitates a much larger staff than would be necessary\r\nwith a more reasonable system [of charges].[104] After very careful\r\nconsideration of these points, Mr. Weaver [one of the members of the\r\ncommittee, and the former Secretary of the Electric and International\r\nTelegraph Company], has no hesitation in expressing his opinion that\r\nthe principle of the stipulations of the tariff authorized by the\r\nTelegraph Act, 1868, both as regards messages transmitted for the\r\npublic, and those forwarded for the press, is essentially unsound,\r\nand has been the main cause of the large percentage of expenditure as\r\ncompared with the gross revenue. In order to provide for the prompt\r\nand efficient transmission of the vast amount of matter produced\r\nby such a system, a considerable extension of plant was necessary,\r\ninvolving a large original cost, besides a regular yearly outlay for\r\nmaintenance and renewal, and not only so, but a large and constantly\r\nincreasing staff had to be provided to work lines, which, if taken\r\nseparately, would not be found to produce anything approaching to the\r\ncost entailed for erecting, working, and maintaining them. It will be\r\nobvious, therefore, that, unless a retrograde step be taken in order to\r\namend the principles upon which the stipulations of the tariff are made\r\nup, it would be unreasonable to expect that the revenue derived for\r\ntelegraph messages under the present system can ever be made to cover\r\nthe expenses of working, the interest upon capital, and the ultimate\r\nextinction of the debt.\"[105]\r\n\r\nIn May, 1876, Mr. C. H. B. Patey, Principal Clerk in the Post Office\r\nDepartment, testified that the Post Office was losing $100,000 a\r\nyear by transmitting 220,000,000 words for the newspaper press at an\r\naverage price of 8 cents per 100 words. Mr. Patey said 180,000,000\r\nwords were being carried at the rate of 4 cents per 100 words, or\r\nfor $74,180 in the aggregate; and 40,000,000 were being transmitted\r\nat the rate of 24 cents per 100 words, or, for $109,795 in the\r\naggregate.[106] Mr. Patey submitted no calculations in support of his\r\nstatement that there had been a loss of $100,000 on newspaper messages\r\nyielding $183,975. But he cited two illustrations from Hull and the\r\nNottingham-Sheffield-Leeds-Bradford group of towns. He stated that\r\nthe Post Office received $1,600 a year for messages transmitted to\r\nsix newspapers in Hull, and spent $5,275 on the transmission of those\r\nmessages. He added that the service supplied to nineteen towns included\r\nin the Nottingham-Sheffield-Leeds-Bradford group of towns yielded\r\n$21,760, and cost the Post Office $38,270.[107]\r\n\r\nIn 1876, the Postmaster General, through Mr. S. A. Blackwood, Financial\r\nSecretary to the Post Office,[108] asked the Select Committee on the\r\nPost Office (Telegraph Department) to recommend to Parliament that the\r\ntariff on newspaper press messages be made \"24 cents for 75 words or\r\n100 words for each separate town to which each message may be sent, and\r\nthat the 4 cent copy rate be limited to copies delivered by hand in\r\nthe same town.\" That, it will be remembered, was the proposal made and\r\nwithdrawn in 1868 by Mr. Scudamore. The Select Committee recommended\r\nthat the amount of the loss on the newspaper press messages be clearly\r\nascertained, and that the copy rates be raised sufficiently to cover\r\nthat loss. But Parliament failed to act on the recommendation.\r\n\r\nMr. Patey had supported Mr. Blackwood's request with the statement,\r\nbased upon inquiry of postmasters throughout the United Kingdom, that\r\n\"in a very large number of towns only a small part of the telegraphic\r\nnews transmitted was inserted in the newspapers. In many cases, on\r\ninquiry of the proprietors, it was stated that it was not inserted\r\ninasmuch as it was not of interest to the readers. In other cases,\r\nbecause the amount of local news was more than would admit of the\r\nspecial telegraphic news being inserted.\" Mr. Patey also had quoted\r\nfrom a recent issue of the _Glasgow Herald_ the statement, that \"there\r\nwas not a leading provincial paper in the Kingdom, the sub-editorial\r\nroom of which was not littered in the small hours of the morning ankle\r\ndeep with rejected telegraph flimsy;\" and from a recent issue of the\r\n_Freeman's Journal_: \"The fact is, that the Post Office, and the\r\nbetter class of papers as well, are both over-pressed with these cheap\r\nduplicate telegrams. We suppose we pay for about ten times as many as\r\nwe print. Though we get them, and pay for them, so as to insure having\r\nthe best news from every quarter, we regard them rather as a nuisance,\r\nand would be glad to have them reduced in quantity.\" And finally, Mr.\r\nPatey had argued that the newspaper press was able to pay much more\r\nthan it did pay, \"inasmuch as there had been a tendency on the part of\r\nthe papers generally, not confined only to the large papers,\" to get\r\ntheir news by special messages prepared by their own agents and not\r\nsent in duplicate to any extent.[109]\r\n\r\nBefore the _Select Committee on the Revenue Departments Estimates_,\r\n1888, Mr. C. H. B. Patey, Third Secretary to the Post Office, stated:\r\n\"We believe that the tariff under which the press messages are sent in\r\nthis country causes a loss amounting to nearly $1,000,000 a year.\"[110]\r\nIn August, 1888, in the House of Commons, Mr. Cochrane-Baillie asked\r\nthe Postmaster General \"whether in view of the _Report of the Committee\r\non the Revenue Departments Estimates_, he could state that the\r\nGovernment would bring in further legislation to relieve the country\r\nfrom the loss incurred by the present arrangement in connection with\r\npress telegrams?\" The Postmaster General replied that \"he was quite in\r\naccord with the Committee on Revenue Departments but he feared it would\r\nbe difficult to effect any change, since the newspaper press tariff was\r\nfixed by the Act of 1868, and had been in force for upward of eighteen\r\nyears.\"[111]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Annual loss on Newspaper Messages estimated at $1,500,000_]\r\n\r\nIn November, 1893, Mr. Arnold Morley, Postmaster General, stated in\r\nthe House of Commons that \"the best estimate that can be formed by the\r\nofficials at the Post Office points to the loss on the newspaper press\r\ntelegrams being at least $1,500,000 a year; and it probably is still\r\nmore.\"[112] In April, 1895, Mr. Arnold Morley, Postmaster General,\r\nrepeated the foregoing statement, and \"maintained it in spite of\r\nvarious statements to the contrary in the newspapers.\" He added: \"and I\r\nshould be quite willing to arrange for an impartial investigation such\r\nas is suggested by the Right Honorable Gentleman, if I were to receive\r\nsatisfactory assurances that the press would abide by the result of an\r\ninquiry, and would undertake not to oppose the passage of the necessary\r\nlegislation for a corresponding revision in the charges, if it should\r\nbe shown that they are insufficient to provide for the cost of the\r\nservice.\"[113] The assurances were not forthcoming; and the newspaper\r\npress tariff remained unchanged.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1900, Mr. R. W. Hanbury, Financial Secretary to the\r\nTreasury, and representative in the House of Commons of the Postmaster\r\nGeneral, a member of the House of Lords, said: \"The penny postage\r\nrealizes an enormous revenue and brings in a profit, but every other\r\npart of the Post Office work is carried on at a loss. The whole profit\r\nis on the penny letter.\"[114]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Betting on Horse Races subsidized_]\r\n\r\nThe Telegraph Act of 1868 provided that newspaper rates should be given\r\nto \"the proprietor or occupier of any news room, club, or exchange\r\nroom.\"[115] The clubs or exchange rooms in question are largely what\r\nwe should term \"pool-rooms,\" places maintained for the purpose of\r\naffording the public facilities for betting on horse races.[116] In\r\n1876 Mr. Saunders, proprietor of the Central News Press Association,\r\ntestified that his association would send in the course of a day to the\r\nsame list of addressees the results of a number of races.\r\n\r\nThe words in the several messages might not aggregate 75 words, and\r\nthus his association would be charged for the transmission of one\r\nmessage only. In that way a number of messages would be transmitted\r\n\"gratuitously.\" Mr. Saunders added that, in 1875, the Post Office\r\nhad transmitted gratuitously for his association 446,000 sporting\r\nmessages. Mr. Patey, Third Clerk in the Post Office, added that while\r\nthe Post Office received 4 cents for transmitting from 8 to 10 sporting\r\nmessages, it had to make 8 to 10 separate deliveries, by messenger boy,\r\non account of those messages which were counted as one; and that each\r\nsuch delivery cost the Post Office on an average two cents. Thus, on a\r\nrecent date, the Post Office had delivered the results of the Lichfield\r\nraces to 205 addressees by means of 1,640 separate deliveries, and had\r\nreceived for the service, on an average, one-half a cent per separate\r\nmessage.[117]\r\n\r\nIn January, 1876, the Post Office discontinued the \"continuous\r\ncounting\" of sporting messages.[118] It took the Department six years\r\nto summon the courage to make this change whereby was effected some\r\ndiminution of the burden cast upon the general body of taxpayers for\r\nthe benefit of the sporting element among the voters of the United\r\nKingdom.\r\n\r\nIt would seem, however, that the practice of \"continuous counting\"\r\nhad been resumed at some subsequent date. For, in March, 1906, in\r\nreply to a question from Mr. Sloan, M. P., the Postmaster General, Mr.\r\nSydney Buxton, said: \"Clubs are, under section 16 of the Telegraph\r\nAct of 1868, entitled to the benefit of the very low telegraph rates\r\naccorded to press messages; and I have no power to discriminate against\r\na legitimate club because it is used for betting purposes. I propose\r\nto consider whether the section ought not to be amended in certain\r\nrespects.\"[119]\r\n\r\nOn December 31, 1875, the Post Office discontinued entirely the\r\npractice--voluntarily assumed--of transmitting sporting messages to\r\nso-called hotels, in reality saloons. The waste of the public funds\r\nthat the Post Office had incurred in response to pressure from the\r\npublicans, is illustrated in Mr. Patey's statement that the Post Office\r\nhad received from a certain Liverpool hotel $0.82 a week for messages\r\nwhich had entailed a weekly expenditure of $2.50 for messenger service\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[98] _Report from the Select Committee on the Post Office_ (_Telegraph\r\nDepartment_), 1876, J.

The Fawcett revision of wages, 1881.\r\n     Lord Frederick Cavendish, Financial Secretary to the Treasury,\r\n     on pressure exerted on Members of Parliament by the telegraph\r\n     employees. Sir S. A. Blackwood, Permanent Secretary to the\r\n     Post Office, on the Fawcett revision of 1881. Evidence as to\r\n     civil servants' pressure on Members of Parliament presented\r\n     to the Royal Commission on Civil Establishments, 1888. The\r\n     Raikes revision of 1890-91; based largely on the Report of the\r\n     Committee on the Indoor Staff, which Committee had recommended\r\n     increases in order \"to end agitation.\" The Earl Compton, M.\r\n     P., champions the cause of the postal employees in 1890; and\r\n     moves for a Select Committee in 1891. Sir James Fergusson,\r\n     Postmaster General in the Salisbury Ministry, issues an\r\n     order against Post Office servants \"endeavoring to extract\r\n     promises from any candidate for election to the House of\r\n     Commons with reference to their pay or duties.\" The Gladstone\r\n     Ministry rescinds Sir James Fergusson's order. Mr. Macdonald's\r\n     Motion, in 1893, for a House of Commons Select Committee. Mr.\r\n     Kearley's Motion, in 1895. The Government compromises, and\r\n     appoints the so-called Tweedmouth Inter-Departmental Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time of the transfer of the telegraphs to the State, February,\r\n1870, the average weekly wages paid by the telegraph companies to the\r\ntelegraphists in the seven largest cities of the United Kingdom,\r\nwas $5.14 for the male staff, and $3.56 for the female staff. That\r\naverage for the male staff includes the salaries of the supervisors;\r\nif the latter be excluded, the average for the rank and file of the\r\nmale employees will fall to $4.80.[120] In 1872, two years after the\r\ntransfer, the average wage of the male telegraphists in the offices of\r\nMetropolitan London was $6.56, while the average wage of the female\r\nclerks was $4.30. For the United Kingdom exclusive of London, the\r\naverage wage of the telegraphists was $5.46 for the male employees,\r\nand $4.50 for the female employees.[121] The latter averages record a\r\nlarger increase of wages in the period 1870 to 1872, than would appear\r\nat first blush upon comparison with the average of 1870, namely: $4.80\r\nfor men telegraphists and $3.56 for women telegraphists. For while\r\nthe figures for 1872 record the averages for the whole United Kingdom\r\nexclusive of London, those for 1870 record the averages of the seven\r\nlargest cities only.\r\n\r\nThe increases in wages and salaries in the years 1870 to 1872 were due\r\nmainly to the all round rise in wages and salaries that occurred in\r\nthe United Kingdom in the period from 1868 to 1872. In the case of the\r\ntelegraphists the rise in wages was postponed until 1870 to 1872, for\r\nthe reason that the telegraph companies, as much as possible, adhered\r\nto the past scale of wages and salaries on account of the pending\r\ntransfer of their properties to the State.[122] The companies were\r\nable to pursue the policy in question by refraining from increasing\r\ntheir forces materially, working their old staff over-time. In part,\r\nhowever, the increase in the wages of the telegraphists after the\r\ntransfer of the telegraphs to the Post Office was due to the fact\r\nthat the Government was obliged to pay the employees in the Telegraph\r\nDepartment something more than the rates of wages prevailing in the\r\nopen market. For, previous to the acquisition of the telegraphs,\r\nthe Government had established the policy of paying its employees\r\nmore than the open market rate for work requiring only fidelity and\r\ndiligence in the performances of routine duty, as distinguished from\r\nwork requiring a high order of intelligence and discretion. Shortly\r\nafter the Post Office had acquired the telegraphs, it was compelled to\r\nextend the aforesaid policy to the new body of State employees. As a\r\nmatter of everyday politics, it proved impossible for the Government to\r\ndiscriminate between the several classes of public servants, paying one\r\npart of them \"fancy\" wages, and the rest of them wages determined by\r\ndemand and supply.[123]\r\n\r\nAn episode from the reorganization of the Civil Service in 1876,\r\nin accordance with the recommendation of the so-called Playfair\r\nCommission, affords insight into the British practice of paying the\r\npublic servants something more than the market rate of wages and\r\nsalaries. The Playfair Commission had recommended that the pay of\r\nthe lower division of Government clerks begin with $325, and rise by\r\nannual increments to $1,000, for seven hours' work a day. Thereupon the\r\nGovernment had fixed the rate at $400, to rise by annual increments to\r\n$1,000. The Playfair Commission had stated that if it had been guided\r\nby the \"voluminous\" evidence which it had taken, it would have fixed\r\nat $750, the maximum to which should rise the salaries of the lower\r\ndivision clerks. But it had desired to attract \"the elite\" of the\r\nclasses that the Government could draw from, and therefore it had fixed\r\nthe maximum at $1,000.[124]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Fawcett Revision of Wages, 1881_]\r\n\r\nIn August, 1881, the House of Commons accepted the proposal of Mr.\r\nFawcett, Postmaster General, to increase the pay of the telegraph\r\noperators, to count seven hours of night attendance a day's work,\r\nand to grant various other minor concessions.[125] Those several\r\nchanges raised the average sum spent for salaries and wages in the\r\ntransmission of a telegraphic message, from 11.70 cents in 1880-81,\r\nto 13.72 cents in 1884-85.[126] Mr. Fawcett stated in the House of\r\nCommons that inquiry of \"leading employees of labor, such as bankers,\r\nrailway companies, manufacturers, and others\" had led him to conclude\r\nthat the telegraph operators were underpaid. He also mentioned the fact\r\nthat while he was considering the arguments that the telegraphists\r\nhad made before him in support of the proposition that their pay was\r\ninadequate, \"outside influence\" was brought to bear repeatedly upon\r\nthe telegraphists, and that the aforesaid outside influence \"went so\r\nfar as to recommend the employees to resort to the last extremity of a\r\nstrike.\"[127]\r\n\r\nMr. MacIver replied that \"he wished to say a word with regard to\r\nthe imputation contained in the statement of the Right Honorable\r\nGentleman, that he [Mr. MacIver] had exercised outside influence upon\r\nthe telegraphists. In common with other members of the House, he had\r\nheard[128] the complaints of the telegraphists, and had thought it\r\nhis duty to bring complaints before the House and the Right Honorable\r\nGentleman, the Postmaster General, so that, if he had erred, he had\r\nerred in common with many others.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Treasury on Civil Service Pressure_]\r\n\r\nIn the course of the debate in the House of Commons, Lord Frederick\r\nCavendish, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, said: \"With respect\r\nto the telegraph clerks, since they had received the franchise,\r\nthey had used it to apply pressure to Members of Parliament for the\r\nfurtherance of their own objects.... If, instead of the Executive being\r\nresponsible, Members of the House were to conduct the administration\r\nof the departments, there would be an end of all responsibility\r\nwhatever. In the same way, if the Treasury was not to have control over\r\nexpenditure, and Members of the House were to become promoters of it,\r\nthe system [of administering the national finances] which had worked\r\nso admirably in the past would be at an end.... With regard to the\r\nposition of the telegraphists in the Government Service as compared\r\nwith their former position under private companies, what had taken\r\nplace would be a warning to the Government to be careful against unduly\r\nextending the sphere of their operations by entering every day upon\r\nsome new field, and placing themselves at a disadvantage by undertaking\r\nthe work of private persons. He pointed out that the Government Service\r\nwas always more highly paid than that of the companies and private\r\npersons, and in the particular case of the telegraph clerks [operators]\r\nthe men themselves received higher pay than they had before.\"[129]\r\n\r\nBefore the Postmaster General had introduced into Parliament his scheme\r\nfor improving the positions of the telegraphists, sorting clerks and\r\npostmen,[130] Lord Frederick Cavendish, in his position as Financial\r\nSecretary of the Treasury,[131] had written the Postmaster General\r\nas follows: ... \"Admitting, as my Lords [of the Treasury] do, that\r\nwhen discontent is shown to prevail extensively in any branch of the\r\nPublic Service, it calls for attention and inquiry, and, so far as\r\nit is proved to be well founded, for redress, they are not prepared\r\nto acquiesce in any organized agitation which openly seeks to bring\r\nits extensive voting power to bear on the House of Commons against\r\nthe Executive Government responsible for conducting in detail the\r\nadministration of the country. The persons who are affected by the\r\nchange now proposed are, as you observe, no fewer than 10,000, and the\r\nentire postal service numbers nearly five times as many. Other branches\r\nof the Civil Service employed and voting in various parts of the United\r\nKingdom, are at least as numerous in the aggregate as the servants\r\nof the Post Office. All this vast number of persons, not living like\r\nsoldiers and sailors outside ordinary civil life are individually and\r\ncollectively interested in using their votes to increase, in their\r\nown favor, the public expenditure, which the rest of the community,\r\nwho have to gain their living in the unrestricted competition of the\r\nopen market, must provide by taxation, if it is provided at all. My\r\nLords therefore reserve to themselves the power of directing that the\r\nexecution of the terms agreed to in the preceding part of the letter be\r\nsuspended in any post office of which the members are henceforth known\r\nto be taking part in extra-official agitation. They understand that you\r\nare inquiring whether the law, as declared in the existing Post Office\r\nActs, does not afford to the public similar protection in respect of\r\npostal communication, including telegraphs, as is afforded by the Act\r\n38 and 39 Victoria, c. 86, s. 4, to municipal authorities and other\r\ncontractors, against breaches of contracts of service in respect of\r\ngas or water, the wilful interruption to the use of which [by means\r\nof a strike] is hardly of more serious import to the local community\r\nthan is that of postal communications to the national community. If\r\nthe existing Post Office Acts do not meet this case, it will be for my\r\nLords to consider whether the circumstances continue to be such as to\r\nmake it their duty to propose to Parliament an extension to the Post\r\nOffice of provisions similar to those cited above from the Act 38 and\r\n39 Victoria, c. 86, s. 4.\"[132]\r\n\r\nIn June, 1882, Mr. Fawcett, Postmaster General, said in the House of\r\nCommons: \"The House would remember how, last session, he was pressed\r\nby honorable Members on both sides of the House to increase the pay\r\nof the telegraph employees ... in spite of all that was done for the\r\ntelegraph employees, he noticed that they were constantly saying that\r\nwhat they received was worse than nothing. All he could say was that\r\nif $400,000[133] a year out of public funds was worse than nothing,\r\nhe, for one, deeply regretted that that sacrifice of public money was\r\never made.\"[134] In March, 1883, Mr. Fawcett, Postmaster General,\r\nsaid: \"The salaries of the telegraph employees have--I will not say\r\nby the pressure of the House, but certainly with the approval of the\r\nHouse--been increased [in 1881]. I do not regret that increase; I think\r\nthe extra pay they receive was due to them, and if I had not thought\r\nso, no number of memorials would have induced me to recommend the\r\nTreasury to make such a large sacrifice of revenue.\"[135] In April,\r\n1884, Mr. Fawcett, Postmaster General, said: \"$750,000 a year has\r\nbeen spent [of late] in improving the position of the telegraphists\r\nand letter sorters, and I say there never was an expenditure of\r\npublic money which was more justifiable than that. If we had yielded\r\nto mere popular demands and thrown away the money we should deserve\r\nthe severest censure; but I believe that if an increase of wages had\r\nnot been conceded, it would have been impossible to carry on the\r\nadministration of the Department; and I think there is no economy so\r\nunwise as refusing to increase remuneration when you are convinced that\r\nthe circumstances of the case demand the increase.\"[136]\r\n\r\nIn July, 1888, the following questions and answers passed between the\r\nChairman of the Select Committee on Revenue Departments Estimates, and\r\nSir S. A. Blackwood, Secretary to the Post Office. \"With respect to\r\nthe increase of salaries at the time when Mr. Fawcett was Postmaster\r\nGeneral, I presume that those recommendations of his were founded upon\r\nrecommendations addressed to him by the [permanent officers of the]\r\nDepartment?\" \"I can hardly say that they were. Mr. Fawcett held very\r\nstrong views himself as to the propriety of making an increase to the\r\npay of the lower ranks of the Department, and he carried out that\r\narrangement.\" \"But the Department, I take for granted, was not excluded\r\nfrom expressing an opinion upon the subject?\" \"Certainly not. I became\r\nSecretary at the time [1880] when Mr. Fawcett became Postmaster\r\nGeneral.[137] I never should have initiated such a movement, but I saw\r\ngreat force in many of the reasons which Mr. Fawcett urged in favor of\r\nsuch an increase; and, at any rate, the Department, as represented by\r\nme, saw no reason to raise a serious opposition, if it were at liberty\r\nto do so, to the Postmaster General's views and determinations.\"[138]\r\n\r\nBefore the Tweedmouth Committee, 1897, Mr. E. B. L. Hill, \"practically\r\ncommander-in-chief of the provincial postmen,\" testified as follows\r\nupon that part of the Fawcett revision of 1882 that applied to the\r\npostal service proper. He said that previous to 1882 all the revisions\r\nof the wages of the postmen had been made on the basis of demand\r\nand supply; but that the Fawcett revision had departed from that\r\npolicy.[139]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Evidence, in 1888, as to Civil Service Pressure_]\r\n\r\nThe Royal Commission on Civil Establishments, 1888, took up at some\r\nlength, the question of the pressure brought by the civil servants upon\r\nthe House of Commons for increases of wages and salaries. Before that\r\nCommission, Sir Reginald E. Welby, who had entered the Treasury in\r\n1856, had become Assistant Financial Secretary in 1880, and had been\r\nmade Permanent Secretary to the Treasury in 1885, testified that many\r\nMembers of the House of Commons had recently attended meetings of the\r\ncivil servants for the purpose of endorsing the claims of the civil\r\nservants for increases of pay; and that they had taken that action\r\nwithout having made a close examination of the grounds upon which the\r\ncivil servants had put forward their claims. He added: \"It is utterly\r\nimpossible for us [the Treasury] to ignore these symptoms that make it\r\nvery difficult to keep within reasonable bounds the remuneration of\r\nsuch a body.\" Thereupon one of the members of the Royal Commission said\r\nto Sir R. Welby: ... \"but are you not aware that there is a general\r\nfeeling throughout the country among the people who are employed by\r\nprivate individuals and public bodies [other than the State], that\r\nGovernment servants receive higher pay than they do, and that when\r\nthese persons are called upon to exercise the franchise they bring\r\npressure to bear upon their Members just the other way [_i. e._,\r\nagainst the increase of government wages and salaries]?\" Sir R. Welby\r\nreplied: \"Of course, I have no means of testing that. I am very glad to\r\nhear that Parliamentary influence is not all in one direction. We do\r\nnot see the proof of it at the Treasury.\"[140]\r\n\r\nSir Algernon E. West, Chairman Inland Revenue Commissioners,[141] said\r\nhe wished for a greater spirit of economy, \"not in the offices so much\r\nas outside.\"\r\n\r\nThereupon the Chairman of the Royal Commission said: \"I do not quite\r\nunderstand what you mean by outside.\" Sir Algernon E. West replied: \"I\r\nsay it with all possible deference, particularly Parliament.\" To the\r\nfurther query: \"Has there been on the part of Members of Parliament, an\r\nincrease of intervention on behalf either of the individual officers of\r\nthe Inland Revenue or on behalf of classes of the Inland Revenue since\r\nthe enfranchisement in 1869?\" Sir A. West replied: \"A large increase\r\non behalf of classes, not of individuals.... I should like to add ...\r\nthat I think last year the Lower Division clerks succeeded in getting\r\ntwo hundred Members of Parliament to attend a meeting which was held to\r\nprotest against their grievances.\"[142]\r\n\r\nSir Lyon Playfair, who had been Chairman of the Royal Commission\r\non the Civil Service, 1874 to 1876, and the author of the Playfair\r\nReorganization of the Civil Service, 1876, testified as follows before\r\nthe Royal Commission of 1888. \"Unfortunately Members of Parliament\r\nyield to pressure a great deal too much in that direction, and they are\r\ncertainly pressing the Exchequer to increase the wages and salaries of\r\nthe employees of the Crown.... In a private establishment a man looks\r\nafter his own interests, and if a person came to him and said: 'Now you\r\nmust increase the salaries of these men by $100 or $250 all round,'\r\nhe would say: 'You are an impertinent man, you have no business to\r\ninterfere,' but you cannot say that to Members of Parliament, and\r\nthere is continual pressure from Members of Parliament to augment the\r\nsalaries of the civil servants.\"[143]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Raikes Revision of 1890-91_]\r\n\r\nWith the increase of the number of telegraphic messages transmitted,\r\nfrom 33,278,000 in 1884-85, to 62,403,000 in 1889-90, the average sum\r\nspent on wages and salaries per message transmitted, fell from 13.72\r\ncents in 1884-85, to 10.62 cents in 1889-90. In the following year,\r\n1890-91, Mr. Raikes, Postmaster General, inaugurated an extensive\r\nscheme of increases in wages, reductions in the hours of work, and\r\nother \"improvements in the condition\" of the telegraph employees, that\r\nagain raised to 12.28 cents per message in 1894-95, the average sum\r\nspent on wages and salaries. Mr. Raikes, Postmaster General, raised the\r\nwages of the supervising staff, as well as the wages of the rank and\r\nfile;[144] he granted payment at one and one-quarter rates for over\r\ntime, granted payment at double rates for all work done on Sunday,\r\ngave extra pay for work done on Bank Holidays, and increased from half\r\npay to full pay the sick-leave allowance. The annual cost of those\r\nconcessions Mr. Raikes estimated at $500,000 a year. The cost of the\r\nconcessions granted at the same time to the employees in the postal\r\nbranch of the Post Office Department, he estimated at $535,000 a\r\nyear.[145]\r\n\r\nMr. Raikes' schemes were based largely upon the _Report of Committee\r\nof the Indoor Staff_. That Report has not been published; but in 1896,\r\nMr. Lewin Hill, Assistant Secretary General Post Office, London, stated\r\nbefore the so-called Tweedmouth Committee,[146] that the majority\r\nof the committee on the Indoor Staff had signed the Report because\r\nthey believed that if the concessions recommended in the Report were\r\ngranted, \"that would be the end of all agitation.\" Mr. Hill added: \"I\r\nremember myself saying [to the Committee] whatever else happens, that\r\nwill not happen. Do not delude yourselves with the notion that the\r\nmen will cease to ask.\" He continued: \"Mr. Raikes' improvements were\r\nreceived with the greatest gratitude, and there were any number of\r\nletters of thanks from the staff; but the ink was scarcely dry when the\r\ndemands began again, and they have been going on ever since, and will\r\ngo on.... There is, unfortunately, a growing habit among the main body\r\nof Post Office servants to use their voting power at elections to get\r\nhigher pay for themselves, and it is well known that in constituencies\r\nin which political parties are at all evenly balanced, the Post Office\r\nservants can turn the election.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Earl Compton demands a Select Committee_]\r\n\r\nThe Committee on the Indoor Staff appointed by Mr. Raikes in March,\r\n1890, had not had the approval of the rank and file of the civil\r\nservants, nor had it had the approval of the representatives of\r\nthe civil servants in the House of Commons, on the ground that it\r\nconsisted of government officials, who were not responsible directly\r\nto the voters. Therefore one of the leading representatives in the\r\nHouse of Commons of the Post Office employees, Earl Compton,[147]\r\non April 15, 1890, had moved: \"That, in the opinion of the House,\r\nthe present position of the telegraphists in London and elsewhere is\r\nunsatisfactory, and their just grievances require redress.\"[148] In\r\nthe course of his argument, Earl Compton said: \"Perhaps the Right\r\nHonorable Gentleman [the Postmaster General] has been cramped [in\r\nthe administration of his department] by what is called officialism.\r\nIn that case, if the present motion is passed, the Right Honorable\r\nGentleman's hands will be strengthened [against his permanent\r\nofficials], and he will be able to redress the grievances which have\r\nbeen brought under his attention.\"\r\n\r\nBaron F. de Rothschild followed Earl Compton, with the statement: \"The\r\nPostmaster General may well say it is no business of ours to interfere\r\nbetween the civil servants and himself, but here I would venture to\r\nask him whether the civil servants are not quite as much our [_i. e._,\r\nthe public's] servants as they are those of the Postmaster General?\"\r\nBaron de Rothschild went on to say that through an error made in the\r\ncourse of the transmission of a telegram his betting agent had placed\r\nhis money on the wrong horse, causing him to lose a considerable sum of\r\nmoney. Such mistakes would not occur if the telegraphists were better\r\npaid.\r\n\r\nSir A. Borthwick regretted \"the increasing tendency to invoke the\r\ndirect interposition of Parliament between the Executive Government and\r\nthe Civil Service.\"\r\n\r\nThe Postmaster General concluded his statement with the words: \"I hope\r\nthat after the statement which I have been able to make, the House\r\nwill recognize the claim of every Government that the House shall\r\nnot interfere with matters of Departmental administration, except\r\nwhere it thinks fit to censure the Minister in charge. So long as a\r\nMinister occupies his position at the head of a department, he ought\r\nto be allowed to occupy it in his own way. I venture to hope that the\r\nHouse will leave questions of this sort in the hands of those who\r\nare directly and primarily responsible for them, in the belief that\r\ngrievances of the servants of any department are not likely to lack\r\ncareful consideration, and, I believe, just and fair treatment.\"\r\n\r\nA few months later, the Postmaster General made this statement in\r\nthe House of Commons: \"I wish to correct one misapprehension. It is\r\nsupposed that the position of the Government is that only the market\r\nvalue should be paid for labor of this sort [the nonestablished\r\npost office servants]. Those who sat in the Committee [of Supply]\r\nwill remember that I laid down a different doctrine the other day.\r\nMy own view is, that while the market value must be the governing\r\nconsideration, because we are not dealing with our own money, but with\r\nthe money of the taxpayers, the taxpayers would wish that, in applying\r\nthat standard to those in the Public Service, we should always bear in\r\nmind that a great Government should treat its employees liberally.\"[149]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEarl Compton failed to carry his motion in 1890; and in the following\r\nyear he made another unsuccessful attempt, moving: \"That, in the\r\nopinion of this House, it is desirable that a Select Committee be\r\nappointed to inquire into the Administration of the Post Office.\"[150]\r\n\r\nMr. Ambrose, speaking against the motion, said: \"Questions between\r\ncapital and labor and between the Government and its employees should\r\nnot be influenced by motions in the House. We are all subjected as\r\nMembers of this House to all manner of whips from employees of the\r\nCivil Service and the Post Office, and I know that when the _status_\r\nof the Civil Service clerks was being settled some time ago, there\r\nwas, among Members generally, a feeling of disgust at the telegrams\r\nand letters being received almost very minute from people seeking to\r\ninfluence our votes on some particular question of interest to them.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Raikes, Postmaster General, enumerated in detail the concessions\r\nmade to the telegraphists and letter sorters in 1890 and 1891, at a\r\ncost of $1,035,000 a year, and added: \"and to all this, not one single\r\nreference has escaped those who have spoken.\" He concluded with the\r\nwords: \"It would never do if, in order to encourage the vaporings of\r\nthree or four of those gutter journals which disfigure the Metropolitan\r\nPress, Members of this House were to make the grave mistake of throwing\r\ndiscredit upon a body of men like the permanent officials [Executive\r\nOfficers] of the Post Office, of whom any country might be proud,\r\nwith whom, I believe, any Minister would be delighted to work, and of\r\ndiminishing the authority in his own Department of a Minister, who,\r\nwhatever may be his personal deficiencies, at heart believes that he\r\nhas done nothing to forfeit the confidence of this House.\"\r\n\r\nA few months later, when the House was considering the Estimates of\r\nthe Post Office Department, the Postmaster General said: \"Economists\r\n[advocates of economy] of former days would have been interested and\r\nsurprised by the general tenor of the debate to which we have just\r\nlistened. The great point used to be, as I understand, to show a\r\nlarge balance of revenue to the State [from the Post Office], and to\r\nmake a defense against charges of extravagance in the past. But we\r\nhave now arrived at a time when the opposite course is to be taken,\r\nand the only chance a Minister has of enjoying the confidence of\r\nthis House is to point to a diminished balance of revenue and to a\r\ngreater expenditure on the part of the department.\" ... In 1891-92 our\r\ntelegraph expenditure will increase by $3,000,000, while our revenue\r\nwill increase by $1,700,000; \"the reason is to be found in the very\r\ncomprehensive measures framed in the course of the last year for the\r\nimprovement of the position of the staff.\"[151]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Civil Servants circularize Members of Parliament_]\r\n\r\nMr. Raikes died in August, 1891; and in June, 1892, Sir James\r\nFergusson, his successor, asked the House of Commons to permit him to\r\ncall attention to a circular addressed to Candidates at the [impending]\r\nGeneral Election, and also sent to Members of the [present] House.\r\nThe circular had been issued by \"The Provincial Postal Telegraph Male\r\nClerks\" to \"Candidates at the General Election,\" and contained the\r\nfollowing statement: \"We have, in addition, to ask you whether you\r\nwill, if elected, vote for the appointment of a Parliamentary Committee\r\nto inquire into the working of the Telegraph Service, as we believe\r\nsuch an investigation would be of great utility, and could not but tend\r\nto the improvement of the service, the state of which is causing great\r\npublic dissatisfaction, as will be seen from the subjoined newspaper\r\nextracts. In conclusion, we beg to state that we await your reply to\r\nthese few questions of vital importance with considerable anxiety, and\r\ntrust that you will give them your careful consideration.\"\r\n\r\nSir James Fergusson added that another branch of the Post Office\r\nservants was issuing similar circulars.[152]\r\n\r\nHe said, \"I think that there would be an end to the discipline which\r\nshould characterize members of the Public Service if encouragement\r\nwere given to such attempts to bring pressure to bear on Members of\r\nthe House and Candidates on the eve of a General Election.... I have\r\nto say that the leading Members of the Opposition, including the right\r\nhonorable Member for Midlothian [Mr. W. E. Gladstone], and the right\r\nhonorable Member for Derby [Sir Wm. Harcourt], fully concur in the\r\nobservations I have made.\"[153]\r\n\r\nA few days later, the Postmaster General issued the following notice:\r\n\"The Postmaster General at the same time warns Post Office servants\r\nthat it would be improper for them, in combination or individually, to\r\nendeavor to extract promises from any candidate for election to the\r\nHouse of Commons with reference to their pay or duties.\"\r\n\r\nIn the House of Commons Sir James Fergusson defended this notice\r\nin these words: \"I in no way deny the right of Members of the\r\nPublic Service to appeal to Members of this House to get their case\r\nrepresented here, but there is all the difference between Members being\r\nasked to represent a _prima facie_ case, and candidates being asked to\r\npledge themselves upon an ex-parte statement to support a revision [of\r\nwages and salaries] or a commission of inquiry--in fact, to prejudge\r\nthe case. To ask for such a promise as a condition of giving a vote\r\ndoes seem to me inconsistent with the duties of a public servant, and\r\nto go beyond his constitutional privileges. In that view the warning\r\nhas been issued. By what law or right has this been done, the honorable\r\nMember asks? By the right and duty which belongs to the head of a\r\nDepartment to preserve proper discipline.\"[154]\r\n\r\nIn August, 1892, the Salisbury Government was succeeded by the\r\nGladstone Government, and Mr. Arnold Morley became Postmaster General.\r\nOn August 28, 1893, Mr. W. E. Gladstone, First Lord of the Treasury, in\r\nreply to a question from Mr. Macdonald, said: \"Questions may be raised,\r\non which I have no judgment to give on the part of the Government, as\r\nto how far, for example, it is desirable for the public functionaries\r\nto make use of their position as voters for the purpose of obtaining\r\nfrom candidates promises or engagements tending directly to the\r\nadvantage of public servants in respect of pay and promotion. These are\r\nmatters which we deem not undeserving of consideration; but still they\r\ndo not form the subject of any decision on the part of Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment in the nature of a restraint.\"[155] In accordance with the\r\npolicy thus announced, the Gladstone Ministry rescinded Sir James\r\nFergusson's order of June 17, 1892.[156]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Mr. Macdonald demands a Select Committee_]\r\n\r\nIn September, 1893, while the House was in Committee of Supply, Mr.\r\nMacdonald[157] moved \"a reduction of $500 in respect of the Salary\r\nof the Postmaster General\", in order to bring before the committee\r\nthe demand of the Post Office employees for \"an independent inquiry\r\nby a Parliamentary Committee.\" He stated \"that in 1891 the present\r\nPostmaster General [Mr. Arnold Morley] voted in favor of an inquiry\r\nsuch as that for which he [Mr. Macdonald] now asked, and he wished\r\nto know whether anything had occurred to cause the Right Honorable\r\nGentleman to change his view since that time.\"[158]\r\n\r\nThe Postmaster General, Mr. Morley, replied: \"He was asked how he\r\ncould account for his vote in 1891 when he had supported the Motion of\r\nthe noble Earl, the Member for Barnsley [Earl Compton]? He accounted\r\nfor it on two grounds: He had supported the proposal, which was an\r\nunprecedented one, because there was an unprecedented condition of\r\ndiscontent prevailing throughout the Postal and Telegraph Service--or,\r\nhe confessed, he was under that impression at the time. The condition\r\nof things in various branches of the Service was serious. There had\r\nbeen an _émeute_ in the Savings Bank Department, and whether with\r\nreason or without reason, the whole of the Services were discontented\r\nwith their position. The condition of things at present, however, did\r\nnot bear out the idea that there was anything like general discontent\r\nprevailing. He accounted for his action on another ground. Since 1891\r\nlarge concessions had been made, with enormous additional expense to\r\nthe country, and that made the state of things very different to what\r\nit was when he supported the noble Earl's Motion.\"\r\n\r\nEarl Compton said: \"He had several times in past years stood up and\r\nspoken for the telegraph clerks, and as the Amendment before the\r\ncommittee related practically to them, it would be dishonest and mean\r\non his part, if, having taken a strong course [while sitting] in\r\nopposition, he did not take the same course now his friends were in\r\npower.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Macdonald's Motion was lost.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Mr. Kearley demands a Select Committee_]\r\n\r\nIn May, 1895, Mr. Kearley[159] moved: \"That in the opinion of this\r\nHouse, it is highly desirable that the terms and conditions of\r\nemployment in the Post Office should be made the subject of competent\r\nand immediate inquiry, with a view to the removal of any reasonable\r\ncause of complaint which may be found to exist.\"[160] The Motion was\r\nseconded by Sir Albert K. Rollit.[161] Mr. Kearley stated at the\r\noutset, that his remarks would be directed to the advisability of\r\ngranting some inquiry. He was not in a position to assert that any\r\nparticular alleged grievance really existed as stated by the employees;\r\nbut there could be no doubt that there was general discontent. Mr.\r\nKearley next stated that the most serious grievance alleged by the\r\nPost Office employees was inadequacy of pay arising from stagnation of\r\npromotion. It was true that at the time the blocking extended only to\r\nthe more highly paid portions of the rank and file, but it must soon\r\nextend to the general body of employees unless relief were afforded.\r\nIn 1880, and in 1890, Parliament had sanctioned respectively the\r\nFawcett revision of wages, and the Raikes revision, for the purpose of\r\ncorrecting inadequacies of pay arising from stagnation of promotion.\r\nThe employees now demanded the abolition of the classes into which were\r\ndivided the various grades of the rank and file of the Post Office\r\nemployees; they demanded assured promotion to a definite maximum wage\r\nor salary.\r\n\r\nThat demand rested on the assumption that the employees had a\r\nvested right to the rate of promotion that had obtained under the\r\nextraordinary increase of telegraphic business that had followed the\r\ntransfer of the telegraphs to the State in 1870, and had followed the\r\nadoption of the 12 cent tariff in October, 1885.[162]\r\n\r\nMr. Kearley supported his argument by reference to the telegraphists,\r\nwho enter the service between the ages of fourteen and eighteen, as\r\nsecond class telegraphists, and in the course of fourteen years rise\r\nby annual increments from the wage of $3 a week to $10 a week. At the\r\nlatter wage they remain, unless they are promoted to be first class\r\ntelegraphists, whose wages rise by annual increments, from $10 a week\r\nto $14 a week--payment for over-time, and so forth, being excluded in\r\nall cases. Mr. Kearley argued that promotion from the second class to\r\nthe first class was blocked, stating that in Birmingham, in the last\r\n4-3/4 years, only 11 men in 168 had been promoted from second class\r\ntelegraphists to first class telegraphists; and that in Belfast and\r\nEdinburgh the annual rate of promotion had been respectively 1.14 per\r\ncent. and 2 per cent. Those instances, said the speaker, were typical\r\nof the larger cities; the conditions in the smaller cities and in the\r\ntowns being still worse.\r\n\r\nMr. Arnold Morley, Postmaster General, replied to this part of Mr.\r\nKearley's argument with the statement that there were in London and in\r\nthe Provinces 3,308 second class male telegraphists, and that out of\r\nthat number only 65 were both eligible for promotion and in receipt of\r\nthe maximum wage of the second class, namely $10 a week. He added that\r\nthe average wage of the men telegraphists who had been promoted from\r\nthe second class to the first in 1894 had been $8.46. That meant that,\r\non an average, the men in question had been promoted three years before\r\nthey had reached the maximum wage of the second class. The Postmaster\r\nGeneral characterized as \"extraordinarily misleading\" the source from\r\nwhich Mr. Kearley had taken his statements of fact, namely, a table in\r\na pamphlet issued by the telegraphists in support of their contention\r\nthat promotion was blocked. The compilers of the table had left out\r\npromotions \"due to causes other than what were termed ordinary causes,\r\nnamely promotions due to appointments to postmasterships and chief\r\nclerkships, to transfers from provincial offices to the central office\r\nin London, and to reductions of officers on account of misconduct.\"\r\nThus at Birmingham there had been, not 11 promotions, but 16; at\r\nLiverpool, not 8, but 37; at Belfast, not 4, but 14; at Newcastle, not\r\n5, but 24; at Bristol, not 6, but 13; at Southampton, not 2, but 8.\r\n\r\nThe second alleged grievance brought forward by Mr. Kearley related to\r\nthe so-called auxiliary staff, which consisted of men who supplemented\r\ntheir earnings in private employment by working for the Post Office\r\nin the mail branch. It was stated that the Post Office was paying the\r\nauxiliary staff from $3.75 to $4.00 a week, whereas it should pay at\r\nleast $6.00 a week. The third grievance related to the so-called split\r\nduties, which involved in the course of the 24 hours of the day more\r\nthan one attendance at the office. The abolition of those duties was\r\ndemanded. The fourth grievance was that some of the younger employees\r\nwere obliged to take their annual three weeks' vacation [on full pay]\r\nin the months of November to February.\r\n\r\nSir Albert Rollit,[163] in seconding the motion, termed \"reasonable\"\r\nthe demand of the telegraphists that the wages of the London\r\ntelegraphists should rise automatically to $1,150 a year; and those of\r\nthe provincial telegraphists to $1,000 a year. At the time the maximum\r\nwage attainable in London was $950, while the maximum attainable\r\nin the provinces was $800. Sir Albert Rollit added that the recent\r\norder of the Post Office that first class telegraphists must pass\r\ncertain technical examinations or forego further promotion and further\r\nincrements in pay, \"amounted almost to tyranny,\" and he further\r\nreflected that \"where law ended, tyranny began.\" Sir Albert Rollit,\r\nan eminent merchant and capitalist, contended that when the existing\r\nbody of telegraphists had entered the service, no knowledge of the\r\ntechnics of telegraphy had been required, and that therefore it would\r\nbe a breach of contract to require the present staff to acquire such\r\nknowledge unless it were specifically paid for going to the trouble of\r\nacquiring such knowledge. That contention of Sir Albert Rollit was but\r\none of many instances of the extraordinary doctrine of \"vested rights\"\r\ndeveloped by the British Civil Service, and recognized by the British\r\nGovernment, namely, that the State may make no changes in the terms and\r\nconditions of employment, unless it shall indemnify by money payments\r\nthe persons affected by the changes. If the State shall be unwilling to\r\nmake such indemnification, the changes in the terms and conditions of\r\nemployment must be made to apply only to persons who shall enter the\r\nservice in the future; they may not be made to apply to those already\r\nin the service. This doctrine is supported in the House of Commons by\r\neminent merchants, manufacturers and capitalists. Sir Albert K. Rollit,\r\nfor instance, is a steamship owner at Hull, Newcastle and London; a\r\nDirector of the National Telephone Company, and he has held for six\r\nyears and five years respectively the positions of President of the\r\nAssociated Chambers of Commerce of the United Kingdom and President of\r\nthe London Chamber of Commerce.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Albert Rollit argued that the Government had broken faith\r\nwith the telegraphers, those public servants, acting under instructions\r\nfrom their leaders, were neglecting to avail themselves of their\r\nopportunities to learn the elementary scientific principles underlying\r\ntelegraphy, and were even repudiating the obligation to acquire\r\nknowledge of those principles. The state of affairs was such that the\r\nEngineer-in-Chief of the Telegraphs, Mr. W. H. Preece, began to fear\r\nthat before long he would be unable to fill the positions requiring an\r\nelementary knowledge of the technics of telegraphy.[164]\r\n\r\nMr. Arnold Morley, Postmaster General, began his reply to Mr. Kearley's\r\nMotion with the statement that \"he understood the mover of the Motion\r\nspoke on behalf of those in the Post Office service who had taken an\r\nactive part in the promoting what he might call an agitation, and that\r\nhis [Mr. Kearley's] position was that, in the condition of feeling in\r\nthe service, some steps ought to be taken which would enable the real\r\nfacts to be brought not only before the public, but before Parliament.\"\r\n... He [Mr. Morley] had made a careful examination of most of the\r\nalleged grievances during the three years he had been at the Post\r\nOffice, and though he had satisfied himself that in the main they were\r\nnot well founded, he recognized that a very strong feeling existed not\r\nonly among a portion of the staff, but also among the public, and among\r\nMembers of the House.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Civil Servants' Campaign of Education_]\r\n\r\nThe feeling in question the Postmaster General attributed largely to\r\nthe manner in which the case of the telegraphists had been presented\r\nby the telegraphists in the House of Commons, and in the newspaper\r\npress. He spoke of the \"extraordinarily misleading\" table of promotions\r\npublished by the telegraphists. He then went on to state that recently\r\nthe Postmaster at Bristol had reorganized the local telegraph office.\r\nBy reducing the amount of over-time work, and by abolishing four\r\njunior offices, he had effected a saving of $3,000 to $3,500 a year.\r\nThereupon a local newspaper had come out with the heading: \"A Premium\r\non Sweating;\" and had made the statement, which was not true, that the\r\nlocal Postmaster had received a premium of $500 for effecting a saving\r\nof $3,800 at the expense of the staff.[165] Mr. Morley continued with\r\nthe statement that in June, 1894, a deputation from the London Trades\r\nCouncil had complained to the Postmaster General that skilled electric\r\nlight men were often employed by the Post Office at laborer's wages at\r\nits factory at Holloway, citing the case of one Turner. Upon inquiry\r\nthe Postmaster General had learned that Turner had been employed as a\r\nwireman, had been \"discharged from slackness of work,\" and, upon his\r\nown request in writing, had been taken back \"out of kindness\" as a\r\nlaborer. The same deputation had mentioned the case of one Harrison,\r\nalleged to be earning on piece work, at the Holloway Factory, $1.75,\r\n$2.25, and $3.75 a week. On inquiry the Postmaster had ascertained\r\nthat Harrison was able to earn $10 a week and more, but that \"for the\r\npurpose of agitation, he had deliberately lowered the amount of his\r\nwages by abstaining from doing full work.\" After the Postmaster General\r\nhad informed the London Trades Council of the facts of the case, that\r\nbody had passed resolutions denouncing the postal authorities at the\r\nHolloway Factories. Again, Mr. Churchfield, Secretary of the Postmen's\r\nFederation, in an interview with the representative of a London\r\nnewspaper had stated that the shortest time worked by the men on split\r\nduties was 12-3/4 hours, while the longest was 22 hours [in the course\r\nof one day and night]. A duty of seven hours lasting from 8 p. m. to\r\n10 p. m., and from 12 p. m. to 5 a. m., Mr. Churchfield had called a\r\ncontinuous duty of twenty-two hours, lasting from 12 p. m. to 10 p.\r\nm. The public also was \"grossly misled\" as to the condition of the\r\nauxiliary postmen. For example, one Mears was alleged to earn, after\r\n27 years' service, only $3 a week. Inquiry showed that Mears worked\r\nin a warehouse during the day, and received from the Post Office $3 a\r\nweek for duties performed between the hours of 6 p. m. and 10 p. m.\r\nOther cases had been reported, but in not one instance had the figures\r\nbeen correct. One man in receipt of $3.94 a week, had been put down at\r\n$2.62. The London auxiliary postmen received from 12 cents to 18 cents\r\nan hour; they were mainly small tradesmen, shop assistants, and private\r\nwatchmen. In the country, the auxiliary postmen received from 8 cents\r\nto 10 cents an hour.\r\n\r\nThe Postmaster General continued with the statement that the increases\r\nin wages and the concessions granted by Mr. Fawcett and Mr. Raikes had\r\naugmented the combined expenditures of the postal branch and telegraph\r\nbranch by $3,750,000 a year.[166] \"In 1881, the wages formed 48.7\r\nper cent. of the gross expenditure, whereas now they formed 59.9 per\r\ncent.... He did not think that he need add to those figures, except\r\nto say that in addition to salaries there were a large number of\r\nallowances for special duties. In the circulation office in London\r\nwere 4,000 sorters, of whom 250 had each an allowance of $2.50 a\r\nweek, while a very large number had allowances of $1.25, $0.75 and\r\n$0.50, of which never a word was said when complaints were made about\r\nsalaries.\" The demands made by the telegraphists would increase the\r\nState's expenditures by $3,250,000 a year, \"taking into account the\r\nconsequential advances which other classes in the Public Service,\r\ntreated on the same footing, would naturally receive.\" Similarly, the\r\nletter sorters made an application involving a direct increase of\r\n$635,000, and an indirect increase of another $2,500,000.\r\n\r\nMr. Morley next recited some statistics to show, \"first of all, the\r\ndesire among people outside to come into the Post Office Service,\r\nand secondly, the disinclination of those inside to go out.\" The\r\nPost Office recently had called for 650 male letter sorters, and had\r\nreceived 1,506 applications. A call for 188 \"telegraph learners,\"\r\nhad brought out 2,486 candidates. In London, in 1894, there had been\r\nno resignations among 1,261 first class sorters, and 23 resignations\r\namong 2,958 second class sorters. Out of 5,000 London postmen, 19 had\r\nresigned in 1894; and in the 5 years ending with 1894, a total of\r\n5,700 telegraphists had furnished 348 resignations, including the\r\nresignations of women who left the service in order to marry.[167] \"He\r\ncould not help thinking that when the working men got to know to the\r\nfull extent the terms and prospects of Postal Service, the sympathy\r\nwhich they had so freely bestowed on Post Office employees would be\r\nlargely withdrawn.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Government compromises with the Civil Servants_]\r\n\r\nMr. Morley, Postmaster General, summed up with the statement that\r\n\"he should be the last to deny that change and amelioration might be\r\nrequired in certain respects, but, having examined all the cases, he\r\nbelieved the men of the Postal Service, the Telegraph Staff as well as\r\nthe Postal Staff, were better treated than people from the same class\r\nin private employment. But that opinion was not altogether shared\r\nby the public, or by certain Members of the House of Commons, and\r\ntherefore the Government was prepared to appoint a strong Committee,\r\ncomposed of men who would have special and practical knowledge and\r\nexperience of administration, and who would, he hoped, be assisted\r\nby a Member of the Labor Department of the Board of Trade.... There\r\nmust be upon the Committee one official of the Post Office in order to\r\nassist the Committee, but apart from that one appointment, he proposed\r\nthat the Committee should be appointed from executive officers of the\r\nGovernment not connected with the Post Office.\"\r\n\r\nSir James Fergusson, who had preceded Mr. Morley as Postmaster General,\r\nsaid: \"He could not shut his eyes to the fact that there was no\r\ndifficulty whatever in finding candidates for employment in the Post\r\nOffice. In fact, it was impossible to meet the wishes of many of those\r\nwho desired to enter the Department. In those circumstances he thought\r\nit could hardly be contended seriously that the remuneration offered\r\nwas grossly inadequate, or that the conditions of service were unduly\r\nonerous.\"\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons accepted the compromise offered by the Government.\r\nLord Tweedmouth, Lord Privy Seal and a Member of the Cabinet, was\r\nmade Chairman of the Committee, which consisted, in addition, of Sir\r\nF. Mowatt, Permanent Secretary of the Treasury; Sir A. Godley, Under\r\nSecretary of State for India; Mr. Spencer Walpole, Permanent Secretary\r\nto the Post Office; and Mr. Llewellyn Smith, of the Labor Department of\r\nthe Board of Trade.[168]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[120] _Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Post Office\r\nEstablishments_, 1897; q. 15,119; Mr. Lewin Hill, Assistant Secretary,\r\nGeneral Post Office, London.\r\n\r\n[121] _Return to an Order of the Honorable, The House of Commons_,\r\ndated March 16th, 1898.\r\n\r\n[122] _Parliamentary Paper_, No. 34, Session of 1876, Lord John\r\nManners, Postmaster General; and _Report of the Inter-Departmental\r\nCommittee on Post Office Establishments_, 1897, Mr. L.

Sir Albert K. Rollit, one of the principal\r\n     champions in the House of Commons of the postal employees,\r\n     immediately follows with a motion \"intended to reflect\r\n     upon the Report of the Tweedmouth Committee.\" Mr. Hanbury,\r\n     Financial Secretary to the Treasury, intimates that it\r\n     may become necessary to disfranchise the civil servants.\r\n     The Treasury accepts the recommendations of the so-called\r\n     Norfolk-Hanbury Committee. The average of expenses on account\r\n     of wages and salaries rises from 11.54 cents per telegram\r\n     in 1895-96, to 13.02 cents in 1902-03, concomitantly with\r\n     an increase in the number of telegrams from 79,423,000 to\r\n     92,471,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter the narrative was brought down to the\r\nappointment in 1895, of the so-called Tweedmouth Committee.[169] That\r\nCommittee consisted of Lord Tweedmouth, Lord Privy Seal and a Member\r\nof the Cabinet; Sir F. Mowatt, Permanent Secretary of the Treasury;\r\nSir A. Godley, Under Secretary of State for India; Mr. Spence Walpole,\r\nPermanent Secretary of the Post Office; and Mr. Llewellyn Smith, of the\r\nLabor Department of the Board of Trade.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Terms of Reference to the Committee on Post Office\r\nEstablishments,\" the Postmaster General included this paragraph: \"In\r\nconducting this inquiry, I can have no doubt you will recollect that\r\nthe Post Office is a great Revenue Department; and that, in the words\r\nof the _Select Committee on Revenue Departments Estimates_ in 1888,\r\nit 'is most likely to continue to be conducted satisfactorily, if it\r\nshould also continue to be conducted with a view to profit, as one of\r\nthe Revenue yielding Departments of the State.'\"[170]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _No Service like the Public Service_]\r\n\r\nBefore the Tweedmouth Committee Mr. Lewin Hill, who, as Assistant\r\nSecretary General Post Office, was the executive officer who had\r\ngeneral charge of all the postal and telegraph employees outside\r\nof London, testified as follows: \"My own view is that the time has\r\ncome for telling the postmen, in common with the members of the rest\r\nof the manipulative staff [the telegraphists] in answer to their\r\ndemand for a general rise of wages, that the Post Office Department\r\nis satisfied that the wages already paid are in excess of the market\r\nvalue of their services; that this being so, no general addition to\r\npay will be given, and that if the staff are dissatisfied, and can\r\ndo better for themselves outside the Post Office, they are, as they\r\nknow, at perfect liberty to seek employment elsewhere.\" The Chairman,\r\nLord Tweedmouth, asked Mr. Hill: \"Do you think there is any other\r\nparticular class of employment which is comparable with that of the\r\npostmen [and telegraphists]?\" Mr. Hill replied: \"I thought of railway\r\nservants, whose work in many ways resembles the work of our employees.\r\nIf they have not the same permanence [of tenure] as our own people\r\nhave, they have continuous employment so long as they are efficient,\r\nbut our people have continuous employment whether they are efficient\r\nor not.... In that respect all of us in the Postal Service stand in\r\na unique position, from top to bottom our men are certain as long as\r\nthey conduct themselves reasonably well to retain their maximum pay\r\ndown to the last day they remain in the Service, and whatever their\r\nclass may be, whether postmen, or sorting clerks, or telegraphists, or\r\nofficers of higher grade, they continue, failing misconduct, to rise\r\nto the maximum pay of their class, quite regardless of whether they\r\nare worth the higher pay that they get from year to year.\" The only\r\nconcession that Mr. Hill was willing to recommend was, that in the\r\nlarger towns the time required for postmen and telegraphists to rise\r\nfrom the minimum scale of pay to the maximum be reduced from 13 years\r\nto 6 years.[171]\r\n\r\nMr. J. C. Badcock, Controller of the Metropolitan Postal Service\r\nother than the Service in the London Central Post Office, and Mr. H.\r\nC. Fischer, Controller of the London Central Post Office, joined in\r\nMr. Lewin Hill's recommendation. Mr. Fischer added that the London\r\ntelegraphists should be given better chances of passing from the second\r\nclass to the first class than they had enjoyed in the last three or\r\nfour years,[172] and that the pay of the London senior telegraphists,\r\nwho were a kind of assistants to the assistant superintendents, ought\r\nto be raised above the existing scale of $950.\r\n\r\nMr. C. H. Kerry, Postmaster at Stoke-on-Trent, stated that if the\r\nPost Office Department \"was willing to act, not only the part of the\r\nmodel employer, but of an exceptionally liberal employer; and it was\r\nthought after all that had been done for the staff so recently, that\r\nstill a little further should be done,\" the Department might reduce\r\nfrom 13 years to 5 years the period that it took the rank and file to\r\npass from the minimum salary of their class to the maximum salary. But\r\nthere was no necessity of doing anything for any one, \"on a general\r\nconsideration of the pay given elsewhere to persons performing duties\r\nrequiring about the same amount of intelligence.\" There was \"absolutely\r\nno justification\" for increasing the existing maximum of pay.\r\n\r\nMr. Kerry had entered the Post Office telegraph service in 1870,\r\nafter having served with the Electric and International Company from\r\n1854 to 1870. He said: \"The speed at which the telegraphists had to\r\nwork present, that is the speed per man,[173] because the telegraph\r\ncompanies kept only enough force for the minimum work, and when the\r\nwork increased you had to catch that up by increased effort.... As a\r\nprevious witness said, one of the laws of the service is that there\r\nmust be no delay, but I think there is a well understood law, also,\r\nthat there must be no confusion, and the arrangements made are now\r\nsuch that the maximum of work, as a rule, can be dealt with without\r\nundue pressure.... From 1870 to 1889, I was constantly in the Telegraph\r\nbranch and witnessing from day to day, and almost from hour to hour,\r\nthe work which the telegraphists performed.\" ...[174]\r\n\r\nThis testimony from Mr. Kerry must be borne in mind when reading the\r\ncomplaints of the Post Office telegraphists that the salaries paid by\r\nthe Eastern Telegraph [Cable] Company rise to $1,020 a year, whereas\r\nthe salaries of first class telegraphists in London rise only to $950.\r\nThe employees of the Eastern Telegraph Company have to work under so\r\nmuch greater pressure than the State telegraphists, that Mr. Fischer,\r\nController of the London Central Telegraph Office, was able to state:\r\n\"I have never known a telegraphist in the first class to leave our\r\nservice for that of any of the [Cable] companies. The cable companies\r\ndraw very few men from us, and those drawn away as a rule, are young\r\nmen in the second class who are receiving about $250 or $300, and are\r\nattracted by the prospect of an immediate increase of some $150 upon\r\nentrance into the service of the cable companies.\"[175]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Tweedmouth Committee's Recommendations_]\r\n\r\nThose telegraph offices which are not sufficiently important to justify\r\nthe employment of telegraphists of the first class, are divided into\r\nfour groups: B, C, D and E. The Tweedmouth Committee recommended that\r\nthe maximum salary of the telegraphists in the offices of Group E be\r\nraised from $8 a week to $8.50: in offices of group D from $8.75 to\r\n$9; in offices of group C from $9.50 to $10; and in offices of group\r\nB from $10 to $11. It recommended furthermore that all provincial\r\ntelegraphists should rise automatically and without regard to\r\nefficiency, to a salary of not less than $10 a week. Beyond $10 they\r\nshould not go, unless fully competent. The Committee added that it\r\nplaced \"the efficiency bar at the high figure of $10 a week,[176] for\r\nthe special reason that it may be rigorously enforced, and that all\r\ninducements to treat it as a matter of form, liable to be abrogated for\r\nthe reason of compassion, may be removed.\"\r\n\r\nAs for the telegraphists employed in Metropolitan London, the\r\nTweedmouth Committee recommended that all telegraphists should rise at\r\nleast to \"the efficiency bar\" of $560 a year; and that those who could\r\npass the efficiency bar, should rise automatically to $800, the maximum\r\nsalary of first class telegraphists. In the past, telegraphists in\r\nLondon had been promoted from the second class to the first class, only\r\nupon the occurrence of vacancies. In this case, also, the Committee\r\nadded to its recommendation the words: \"This efficiency bar has been\r\nplaced at the high figure of $560 for the special reason that it may be\r\nrigorously enforced, and that all inducements to treat it as a matter\r\nof form, liable to be abrogated for reasons of compassion, may be\r\nremoved.\"[177]\r\n\r\nThese recommendations the Tweedmouth Committee made in order to meet\r\nthe complaints advanced by the Post Office employees that the falling\r\noff in the rate of increase of the business of the telegraph branch had\r\ncaused a slackening in the flow of promotion.\r\n\r\nThe remaining recommendations of the Tweedmouth Committee it is not\r\nnecessary to enumerate; suffice it to say, that the Postmaster General,\r\nthe Duke of Norfolk, advised the Government to accept all of the\r\nCommittee's recommendations, with the statement that, on the basis of\r\nthe staff of 1897, the cost of carrying out the recommendations would\r\nbegin with $695,000 a year, and would rise ultimately to $1,375,000.\r\nThat estimate related to both branches of the Post Office, the postal\r\nbranch and the telegraph; no separate estimates were made for the\r\nseveral branches.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Government accepts the Committee's Recommendations_]\r\n\r\nThe Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury accepted the\r\nPostmaster General's recommendations, and directed the Financial\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, Mr. R. W. Hanbury, to write as follows to\r\nthe Postmaster General.\r\n\r\n\"It has, of course, been necessary for my Lords to consider very\r\ncarefully proposals involving so large an increase of expenditure\r\nin a single Department at one time, and they have duly weighed the\r\nreasons which the Committee adduces in support of its conclusions.\r\nWhile many of the proposals appear to be abundantly justified by the\r\nconsiderations put forward, there are others which my Lords would have\r\nhesitated to accept on any authority less entitled to respect than\r\nthat by which they are supported. But, my Lords readily acknowledge\r\nthe exceptional competence of the Committee to pronounce a judgment\r\non the question which came before it, and the great care with which\r\nthe inquiry has been conducted. They also note that the conclusions\r\nrepresent the unanimous opinion of the Committee, and that they are,\r\nin all cases, endorsed by your Grace. They have therefore decided,\r\nin view of the weight of authority by which your recommendations are\r\nsupported, to accept them as they stand, and they authorize you to give\r\neffect to them as from the first of April next. They have adopted this\r\ncourse from a strong desire to do full justice to one of the largest\r\nand most important services of the State, and because they feel that\r\nthe settlement now effected must be accepted as permanently satisfying\r\nall reasonable claims on the part of the classes included in its terms.\r\nThe only condition which my Lords desire to attach to their acceptance\r\nof your proposals is that the annual increments of pay should, in\r\nall cases, be dependent on the certificate of a superior officer,\r\nthat the conduct of the recipient during the preceding year has been\r\nsatisfactory.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Sir A. K. Rollit demands a Committee of Business Men_]\r\n\r\nThe recommendations of the Tweedmouth Committee went into effect on\r\nApril 1, 1897. On July 16, 1897, while the House of Commons was in\r\nCommittee of Supply, Sir Albert K. Rollit moved the reduction of the\r\nsalary of the Postmaster General by $5,000.[178] Sir Albert Rollit\r\nsaid: \"The Amendment was intended to reflect upon the report of the\r\nTweedmouth Committee, rather than upon either the Government or the\r\nPost Office Department, for he thought more might be done to remedy\r\nthe abuses which were known [shown?] to exist in the course of the\r\nreport itself. To speak of the Post Office as a revenue earning machine\r\nwas, in his opinion, not a full or adequate description. He shared to\r\nthe full the opinion that its first object was to give facilities to\r\nthe public rather than merely to earn profits, and also to do justice\r\nto its employees.... There were grievances which had not been redressed\r\nby the report, and the House had a great deal more to do in that\r\ndirection. It was no answer to say that the Treasury had appropriated\r\na large sum of $695,000 for that very purpose, for after all, what did\r\nthe appropriation amount to? It only amounted to a rectification of the\r\ninadequacies of the past. It was not in London alone, but throughout\r\nthe United Kingdom, that something like chronic discontent existed.\r\nThe complaints were loud and widespread. He did not at all agree as to\r\nthe propriety of the course intimated [by the telegraphists] by way\r\nof notice to the Postmaster General, that if the grievances were not\r\nredressed, over-time work at night would be suspended [_i. e._ the\r\ntelegraphists would refuse to work over-time in order to compel the\r\nGovernment to redress their grievances]. That was an extreme remedy in\r\ncases where the public convenience and service were concerned; but,\r\nafter all, every man's labor was his own right, and if there were no\r\ndisposition to remedy present grievances, even that extreme way of\r\ntrying to bring about a remedy might possibly have to be resorted\r\nto. The Treasury was, of course, a barrier to a good deal. He did\r\nnot say the heads of a Department did not value as much as he might\r\ndo pecuniarily the services of those who contributed to the joint\r\neffect which he and they made for the public advantage, and if we had\r\na splendid Civil Service in this country, he thought it had one great\r\ndefect, and that was too glaring disproportion between the salaries of\r\nthe highest officials and those of the lower, and this proportion might\r\nwell be redressed.\"\r\n\r\nSir Albert Rollit said he could not enumerate all the grievances,\r\nhe would have to confine himself to the enumeration of the worst\r\nones. He began by endorsing the contention of the telegraphists that\r\neverybody should rise automatically to a salary of $1,000 a year. The\r\nestablishment of the \"efficiency bars\" he said, \"was really a violation\r\nof the contract with the telegraph operators, and was a grave and\r\ngross injustice to them.\" He maintained, also, that the Committee's\r\nrecommendation that the payment for Sunday labor be reduced from\r\ndouble rates to a rate and a half was \"a material alteration of the\r\ncontract under which servants entered the Department.\" He supported\r\nthe contention of the State employees that it was a grievance that\r\nsome of the employees had to take their annual vacation in the winter\r\nmonths. \"The postmen had asked that the Christmas boxes [contributions\r\nfrom the public] be abolished, $26 a year being added to the wages as\r\na compromise. Evidence had been given that $1.25 a year was the real\r\nvalue of the Christmas boxes, but the Committee said there should be\r\nno solicitation for Christmas boxes, and no compensation for their\r\nloss.\" \"He hoped that a statement of grievances, which were provoking\r\nthe strongest possible feeling, with disadvantage to the efficiency\r\nof the Post Office, would be listened to. He was extremely glad to\r\nrecognize that the Postmaster General had been willing to receive two\r\ndeputations--one on June 15, which had not yet been replied to, and one\r\nyesterday. But he would urge upon the Department and the Government\r\nthat the real remedy for this strong and wide discontent was the\r\nappointment of an independent Committee, because the decision of such\r\na tribunal composed not of officials, but of practical business men,\r\nwho would perhaps have more sympathy with men in the lower grades of\r\nthe service, would be loyally accepted, and thus the public would be\r\nadvantaged and contentment restored to a service which was of great\r\nvalue to the country.\" [\"Hear, hear.\"]\r\n\r\nMr. R. W. Hanbury, who, as Financial Secretary to the Treasury,\r\nrepresented in the House of Commons the Postmaster General, the Duke of\r\nNorfolk, replied: \"that throughout the discussion some facts had been\r\nmore or less left out of sight. Honorable Members ought to recollect,\r\nin the first place, that the Tweedmouth Committee gave universal\r\nsatisfaction when it was appointed. It was then agreed that it was the\r\nright kind of Committee; and that the right kind of men were appointed\r\nto serve upon it. There was no preponderance of Treasury opinion upon\r\nthe Committee. In fact, the only Treasury official sitting upon it was\r\nSir Francis Mowatt. There was on it a high representative of the Post\r\nOffice, and the officials of a Department were not as a rule anxious\r\nto cut down the salaries of their subordinates. Their tendency would\r\nrather be to recommend an increase in salaries. There was also on the\r\nCommittee a representative of the Labor Department of the Board of\r\nTrade, who was particularly well qualified to give an opinion as to\r\nthe proportion which the wages of the postal and telegraph employees\r\nbore to the wages of persons doing corresponding work outside the\r\nPost Office. Therefore the Committee was a very efficient body, and\r\nthrough its recommendations the salaries of the officials had already\r\nbeen increased by $700,000 a year, and the increase would amount to\r\nsomething like $1,250,000 a year in the next few years. The Treasury\r\nhad accepted every recommendation of the Committee, whose suggestions\r\nhad been adopted wholesale. There was no ground for complaint,\r\ntherefore, in that direction.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Disfranchisement of Civil Servants Suggested_]\r\n\r\n\"Another fact which Members ought not to overlook was the political\r\npressure which was far too frequently exercised by Civil Servants upon\r\nthose who also represented them.\" [\"Hear, hear.\"] \"That was a great and\r\ngrowing danger. It was chiefly in London that this pressure was brought\r\nto bear.... He would give an instance of the way in which these Civil\r\nServants spoke of the expediency of political pressure. At one of the\r\ngreat meetings which had been held, a speaker said there were 8,000\r\npostmen in London, and that he hoped every one would have his name upon\r\nthe register [of voters], so that at election times they could exercise\r\ntheir influence upon candidates and advocate the cause of higher\r\nwages. He was of the opinion that political pressure ought not to be\r\nbrought to bear in that way.\" [\"Hear, hear.\"] \"Ordinary workmen could\r\nnot exercise the same power, but Civil Servants could, and, whether\r\ntheir agitation succeeded or not, their position was secure, so that\r\nit was a case of 'Heads, I win; tails, I don't lose'.... Before the\r\nRoyal Commission [of 1888], which had inquired into the Civil Service\r\nestablishments, evidence was given with regard to the way in which\r\npressure was brought to bear in certain constituencies upon Members,\r\nand he thought that the almost unanimous feeling of the Commission\r\nwas that, if this state of things continued, it would be necessary to\r\ndisfranchise the Civil Service.\" [\"Hear, hear.\"][179]\r\n\r\nSir Albert Rollit replied: \"They had to acknowledge a very sympathetic\r\nspeech from the Secretary to the Treasury. Perhaps if some honorable\r\nMembers went to the Treasury in regard to this matter, accompanied\r\nby one person who might represent practically the views which were\r\nentertained by those concerned, the matter might be further gone into.\r\nHe begged leave to withdraw his Amendment.\"\r\n\r\nThe Secretary to the Treasury replied: \"There was no objection on\r\nthe part of the Treasury to hearing communications from Members of\r\nParliament on the subject, but with regard to officials of the Post\r\nOffice coming to the Treasury, he should not like to give any pledge\r\nwithout first consulting with the Postmaster General.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Norfolk-Hanbury Committee_]\r\n\r\nShortly afterward the Postmaster General, the Duke of Norfolk, and\r\nthe Financial Secretary to the Treasury, Mr. Hanbury, constituted\r\nthemselves a Committee to investigate the grievances that the\r\nTweedmouth Committee had left unredressed. All Members of the House\r\nof Commons were invited to attend the meetings of the Norfolk-Hanbury\r\nCommittee, and to take part in examining the witnesses. Sir Albert\r\nRollit presented the case of the Post Office employees. The\r\nNorfolk-Hanbury Committee recommended further concessions involving an\r\nadditional outlay of $400,000 a year; and the Treasury accepted the\r\nrecommendations.\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Postmaster General for the year 1897-98 stated that\r\nthe concessions granted would entail a total increase of expenditure of\r\n$1,940,000 a year. The Duke of Norfolk concluded his reference to the\r\nforegoing episodes with the words: \"Since that time I have declined,\r\nand I shall continue to decline, to allow decisions which have been\r\nconsidered by the Tweedmouth Committee, and which have been revised\r\nby Mr. Hanbury and myself, to be reopened. It is my belief that those\r\ndecisions have been liberal, but whether they are liberal or not, it is\r\nfor the interest of all parties that it should be understood that they\r\nare final.\"\r\n\r\nIn April, 1900, Mr. R. W. Hanbury, Financial Secretary to the Treasury,\r\nstated the concessions granted by the Tweedmouth and Norfolk-Hanbury\r\nCommittees were costing $2,200,000 a year. In April, 1901, Mr. Austen\r\nChamberlain, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, said they were\r\ncosting $2,500,000 a year; and in April, 1903, he stated that they were\r\ncosting $3,000,000 a year.[180] Those figures related to the combined\r\npostal and telegraph service. So far as the latter service alone is\r\nconcerned, the average expenses on account of wages and salaries rose\r\nsteadily from 11.54 cents per telegram in 1895-96, to 13.02 cents in\r\n1902-03, under an increase in the number of messages from 79,423,000 in\r\n1895-96, to 92,471,000 in 1902-03. In 1905-06, the average in question\r\nrose to 14.29 cents, partly in consequence of the increases in wages\r\nmade in response to the demands of the Civil Servants, partly in\r\nconsequence of the drop in the number of telegrams to 89,478,000--as a\r\nresult of the growing competition from the telephone.\r\n\r\nIn 1895-96 the receipts of the Telegraph Department proper exceeded\r\nthe operating expenses by $646,000; in 1900-01, the operating expenses\r\nexceeded the receipts by $34,000; in 1903-04 the deficit rose to\r\n$1,505,000, and in 1904-05 it was $917,000. In 1905-06, the gross\r\nrevenue exceeded the operating expenses by $63,500.[181]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[169] _Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Post Office\r\nEstablishments_, 1897, is the official title of the Committee's Report.\r\n\r\n[170] _Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Post Office\r\nEstablishments_, 1897, p. 4.\r\n\r\n[171] _Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Post Office\r\nEstablishments_, 1897; q. 15,119 and following, 11,706, 11,694, 15,123,\r\n11,642 to 11,648, 11,680 to 11,697, 11,774 and 11,805.\r\n\r\n[172] _Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Post Office\r\nEstablishments_, 1897; q. 4,183 to 4,185, 3,907 to 3,912, 3,868 to\r\n3,879 and 4,140 to 4,149.\r\n\r\n[173] Mr. Kerry probably meant that the employees of the companies\r\nworked under greater pressure.\r\n\r\n[174] _Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Post Office\r\nEstablishments_, 1897; q. 6,747 and following, and 6,691 to 6,694.\r\n\r\n[175] _Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Post Office\r\nEstablishments_, 1897; q. 3,863 and 3,853.\r\n\r\n[176] Compare: _Second Report of the Royal Commission appointed to\r\ninquire into the Civil Establishments_, 1888, p. xvi.

So great, indeed, had been the abuses that it had even been\r\nsuggested that civil servants ought to be disfranchised altogether....\r\nAnother great danger that had to be provided against was that in\r\ncertain London constituencies, and in some of the large towns, it was\r\nquite possible that the civil servants might, by combining together,\r\nsucceed in turning the balance at an election in the event of one of\r\nthe candidates refusing to pledge himself with regard to raising the\r\nscale of wage, or an increase in the amount of pensions, or similar\r\nadvantages which the civil servants might desire to obtain.\"\r\n\r\n[180] _Hansard's Parliamentary Debates_, April 27, 1900, p. 135; April\r\n25, 1901, p. 1,325; and April 30, 1903, p. 1,022.\r\n\r\n[181] _Report of the Postmaster General_, 1906.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE POST OFFICE EMPLOYEES CONTINUE TO PRESS THE HOUSE OF COMMONS FOR\r\nINCREASES OF WAGES AND SALARIES\r\n\r\n     The Post Office employees demand \"a new judgment on the\r\n     old facts.\" Mr. S.

Mr. Hanbury,\r\n     Financial Secretary to the Treasury, points out that the\r\n     postal employees are demanding a House of Commons Select\r\n     Committee because under such a Committee \"the agitation and\r\n     pressure, now distributed over the whole House, would be\r\n     focussed and concentrated upon the unfortunate members of the\r\n     Select Committee.\" Mr. Steadman's Motion, in April, 1900.

Mr. Balfour, Prime Minister,\r\n     confesses that the debate has filled him \"with considerable\r\n     anxiety as to the future of the public service if pressure\r\n     of the kind which has been put upon the Government to-night\r\n     is persisted in by the House.\" Captain Norton's Motion, in\r\n     April, 1902. The Government compromises by appointing the\r\n     Bradford Committee of business men. Mr. Austen Chamberlain,\r\n     Postmaster General, states that members from both sides of the\r\n     House \"seek from him, in his position as Postmaster General,\r\n     protection for them in the discharge of their public duties\r\n     against the pressure sought to be put upon them by employees\r\n     of the Post Office.\" He adds: \"Even if the machinery by\r\n     which our Select Committees are appointed were such as would\r\n     enable us to secure a Select Committee composed of thoroughly\r\n     impartial men who had committed themselves by no expression of\r\n     opinion, I still think that it would not be fair to pick out\r\n     fifteen members of this House and make them marked men for the\r\n     purpose of such pressure as is now distributed more or less\r\n     over the whole Assembly.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Civil Servants demand Right to agitate_]\r\n\r\nOn February 18, 1898, in the House of Commons, Mr. S. Woods[182] moved:\r\n\"And we humbly represent to Your Majesty that your servants in the\r\nPost Office are not permitted to exercise the franchise, generally\r\nallowed to other Departments in the State; nor to serve on electoral\r\ncommittees; nor to take part in political agitation; and are otherwise\r\ndeprived of the privileges of citizenship in defiance of the letter\r\nand spirit of the law; that the officials of the Post Office refuse to\r\nrecognize the Postmen's Trade Union; their officials are illegally and\r\nunjustly dismissed for circularizing Parliamentary Candidates; and we\r\nhumbly beg Your Majesty to instruct the Postmaster General to remedy\r\nthese grievances.\"[183]\r\n\r\nSir James Fergusson, a former Postmaster General, said Mr. Woods'\r\nmotion had been brought \"by the direction of the central Committee of\r\nthe Postal Union, or some such party.\" He continued with the statement\r\nthat the motion was the outcome of the agitation carried on since he,\r\nSir James Fergusson, had dismissed from the Post Office service Messrs.\r\nClery and Cheeseman, the ringleaders of a political campaign carried\r\non in violation of Sir James Fergusson's order of June 17, 1892. He\r\nsaid the employees in the Revenue Departments had been disfranchised\r\nin 1782 by the Marquis of Rockingham, Prime Minister, but that the\r\nfranchise had been restored to them in 1868. That in that year both Mr.\r\nDisraeli and Mr. Gladstone had approved the policy of enfranchising\r\nthe employees of the Revenue Departments, subject to the limitation\r\nthat the ministerial heads of the Departments were to have the power to\r\ndetermine the limits within which the employees were to take an active\r\npart in politics. That an attempt had been made in 1874 to remove that\r\nlimitation, but that the House had supported the Government of the day\r\nin resisting the attempt.[184]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _House of Commons is Civil Servants' Court of Appeal_]\r\n\r\nMr. R. W. Hanbury, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, and\r\nrepresentative in the House of Commons of the Postmaster General, the\r\nDuke of Norfolk, said, in the course of his reply to Mr. Woods: \"We\r\nmust recognize the fact that in this House of Commons, public servants\r\nhave a Court of Appeal such as exists with regard to no private\r\nemployee whatever. It is a Court of Appeal which not only exists with\r\nregard to the grievances of classes, and even of individuals, but it is\r\na Court of Appeal which applies even to the wages and duties of classes\r\nand individuals, and its functions in that respect are only limited by\r\nthe common sense of Members, who should exercise caution in bringing\r\nforward cases of individuals, because, if political influence is\r\nbrought to bear in favor of one individual, the chances are that injury\r\nis done to some other individual.... I think it is only reasonable to\r\nexpect that, as both [political] parties in the State have dropped\r\nparty politics with regard to their employees, the employees should\r\nin turn recognize that fact, and drop party politics with regard to\r\ntheir employers.\" Mr. Hanbury enforced this point by stating that, upon\r\nthe request of the Civil Servants themselves, Lord Rockingham, Prime\r\nMinister, in 1782 had disfranchised the Civil Servants in the Revenue\r\nDepartments. At that time the party in power, through the Public\r\nService, controlled 70 seats in Parliament. Lord North, who had been\r\nin power twelve years, had sent out notices to certain constituencies\r\nwhere the Civil Servants were able to turn the scale, saying, that\r\nunless the Civil Servants supported the Government, it would go hard\r\nwith them. Thereupon the Opposition had sent out counter notices, and\r\nthus had put the Civil Service in an awkward position. The result had\r\nbeen that the Civil Servants themselves had requested Lord Rockingham\r\nto disfranchise them.\r\n\r\nMr. Hanbury continued with the statement that, in 1892, Sir James\r\nFergusson had dismissed Mr. Clery for ignoring his order forbidding\r\nCivil Servants to \"circularize\" parliamentary candidates. Thereupon\r\nMr. Clery, at Newcastle-on-Tyne, had said to a political meeting\r\nof postmen: \"They must approach the House of Commons on its weak\r\nside; they must influence Members through their susceptibilities as\r\nopportunity presents itself when candidates appeal to their respective\r\nconstituencies. A man is never more amenable to reason than when making\r\na request.\" Mr. Hanbury continued: \"What private employee is able to\r\nsay: 'I am the permanent servant of my employer; I have a share in\r\ndeclaring who that employer shall be; I will attack him on his weak\r\nside when he comes up for re-election, and then I will use my power? I\r\nwill bring organized pressure to bear throughout the constituencies,\r\nand I will make this bargain: that if he will not vote for an increase\r\nin my pay, or diminish my duties, then I will not give him my vote.'\r\nWe have done away with personal and individual bribery, but there is\r\nstill a worse form of bribery, and that is when a man asks a candidate\r\nto buy his vote out of the public purse. There are three great things\r\nwhich distinguish our permanent public service. There is, in the first\r\nplace, the remarkable loyalty with which they serve both parties in\r\nthe State. Then there is the permanency of their employment. Again,\r\na great feature of that service is that no longer is it a question\r\nof favoritism, but promotion by merit is the rule. Those three great\r\nfeatures have been slowly built upon this foundation--the elimination\r\naltogether of the element of political partisanship from the service.\r\nI hope nothing will be done to break down those foundations, on which\r\nalone the public service can rest--a service which, for its efficiency,\r\nits loyalty, and its high sense of public duty, I do not think is\r\nsurpassed. I doubt whether it is equalled or even approached.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Woods' Motion was lost by a vote of 163 to 86. It was supported\r\nalmost exclusively by the Opposition, only three Government supporters\r\nvoting for it.[185]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Mr. Steadman demands a Select Committee_]\r\n\r\nIn the House of Commons, on February 20, 1899, Mr. Steadman[186]\r\nmoved: \"And we humbly represent to Your Majesty that, in view of the\r\ngreat discontent existing among employees of the Postal and Telegraph\r\nServices, immediate inquiry should be made into the causes of\r\ncomplaint.\"[187] Mr. Steadman had been elected to the House of Commons\r\nby a majority of twenty votes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Parliament not competent to judge_]\r\n\r\nMr. R. W. Hanbury, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, replied that\r\nno new facts had been brought to light since the Tweedmouth Committee\r\nand the Norfolk-Hanbury Committee had made concessions entailing an\r\nannual expenditure of $1,900,000 a year. The Post Office servants\r\nwere demanding \"a new judgment on the old facts.\" He continued: \"I\r\nconfess, I am not quite sure that we did not go too far [in 1897],\r\nbecause by increasing these salaries we are bringing into this service\r\nan entirely new social class; you are bringing in men who perhaps are\r\nsocially a little above their work, and these men naturally have a\r\nstandard of living and requirements which are not essential to men\r\ndoing this kind of work. If we are going to raise the salaries more\r\nand more, you will get a higher social class into the service, and\r\nthere will be no limit to the demands made upon us.\" Mr. Hanbury\r\ncontinued: \"You have got to trust the heads of the Departments, or get\r\nnew heads; it is quite impossible for the House of Commons to go into\r\nall these technicalities, and I know no Department where the work is\r\nmore technical and more complicated than the Post Office. The Treasury\r\nwork is supposed to be hard to learn [by the Members of the House of\r\nCommons working for promotion to the Ministry], but the technicalities\r\nof the Post Office is about the most difficult job I ever had, and I\r\ndo not think a Select Committee would be really able to get to the\r\nbottom of this matter. But, after all, we must recollect another\r\nfact, and it is this: that the Civil Service is a great deal too much\r\ninclined to attempt to put pressure upon Members of Parliament. That\r\nis a very bad system, upon which we ought to put our foot. It is bad\r\nenough when it is brought to bear upon the House as a whole, but what\r\nwould happen with a Select Committee of this House? You would have the\r\nresentment of the Civil Service focussed and concentrated upon the\r\nunfortunate Members of the Committee, and I do not think it would act\r\nmore independently or more impartially than those two bodies which have\r\nsat already.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Steadman's Motion was lost by a vote of 159 to 91. Eighty-six\r\nmembers of the Opposition and two Government supporters voted for the\r\nMotion.[188]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Civil Servants have \"Friends\" in the Commons_]\r\n\r\nOn June 1, 1899, Mr. Steadman moved the reduction of the Postmaster\r\nGeneral's salary by $500, by way of asking the House of Commons\r\nto instruct the Government to appoint a Select Committee of the\r\nHouse of Commons to investigate the grievances of the Post Office\r\nemployees.[189] He said: \"It stands to reason that a Departmental\r\nCommittee [Tweedmouth Committee] composed of officials, which contained\r\nonly one impartial member--a Member of the House of Lords--could not\r\nbe satisfactory to the 160,000 male and female employees in the Post\r\nOffice service.... Every department of the Post Office service now has\r\nits organization. All these organizations right through the departments\r\nhave their coaches and organizers; true, they are not yet directly\r\nrepresented here in this House, but they have friends here who are\r\nprepared to take up their quarrels.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Norton[190] seconded the Motion. He spoke of the fact that\r\nany telegraphist could obtain $30 a year extra pay by making himself\r\ncompetent to discharge the duties of a letter sorter, and another $30\r\nby passing an examination on the technical questions of telegraphy.\r\nHe asserted that it was a grievance that the men had to acquire, in\r\ntheir leisure hours, the additional proficiency in question; and that\r\nonly 46 per cent. of the men were able to pass the examinations on the\r\ntechnical questions involved in telegraphy.\r\n\r\nMr. Maddison[191] supported Mr. Steadman's Motion with the words: \"For\r\nmy part, I have always had some hesitation in taking up the cases of\r\nmen employed by the State, because undoubtedly there is a sort of\r\nnotion that, because they are employed by the State, they can make\r\nsuch demands as they like, because they are paid out of a very full\r\nTreasury. I know that every half penny of that money comes out of the\r\ngeneral taxation of the country, and I agree that we are here as the\r\nguardians of the public purse. The Right Honorable Gentleman has never\r\ndenied that we are here as the guardians of these men's interest, and\r\nit has not been shown that the public interest is of greater importance\r\nthan the interest of these men, who do so much for the prosperity of\r\nthe Country.... In this case we want a non-official committee, although\r\nI confess that I do not think such an inquiry will put an end to\r\ndisputes in the future.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hanbury, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, said that if the\r\nGovernment yielded to the demand for a House of Commons Committee\r\nin this case, there would be a House of Commons Committee sitting\r\npractically every session of Parliament. The points now under\r\ndiscussion had been under agitation for four, five, or six years.\r\nBefore the Tweedmouth Committee entered upon its duties, and before\r\nthe Norfolk-Hanbury Conference with Members of the House of Commons,\r\nthe Government had a distinct understanding with Members of the House\r\nthat the decisions come to should be accepted. Mr. Hanbury continued:\r\n\"It is somewhat difficult, no doubt, to draw a comparison between\r\nwhat the Post Office pays and what is paid by private firms. But I\r\nwill give one comparison, at any rate, and I think it is the only one\r\npossible. A few years ago we took over from the National Telephone\r\nCompany the employees, principally women, who were engaged on the\r\n[long-distance] trunk wires, and I venture to say that, counting in\r\nthe pensions we pay, these people are receiving from 30 per cent. to\r\n40 per cent. larger salaries than when they were in the employment of\r\nthe company. Honorable Members who draw comparisons between servants of\r\nthe State and others, are too apt to forget the great facilities Post\r\nOffice servants get, such as constant employment, large pensions, good\r\nholidays, for which they are paid, and large sick-pay and sick-leave.\r\nIf these are added together, it will be found that the Post Office is\r\npaying wages considerably above the level of those paid by outside\r\nemployers. I should like to say one further word with regard to this\r\napplication for a Committee of this House. Why should we have it at\r\nall? Let me speak with perfect frankness about this thing. We have\r\nalready had two Committees; we have also had a great deal of pressure\r\nbrought to bear upon Members; that pressure is becoming almost\r\nintolerable. The honorable Member for Newington posed as the just\r\njudge and said: 'I am weary of all this agitation; let us try to put\r\nan end to it.' Well I am not weary of the agitation; so long as I am\r\nsatisfied, as I am now, that everything has been done that ought to be\r\ndone for the men, I will not yield to agitation. I say at once that I\r\ndo myself believe that, considering everything, and that full inquiry\r\nhas already been held, the only advantage these men could derive\r\nfrom a House of Commons Committee would be that the agitation and\r\npressure, now distributed over the whole House, would be focussed and\r\nconcentrated upon the Select Committee. I, for one, am not prepared to\r\ngrant a Committee of that kind.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Steadman's Motion was lost by a vote of 157 to 107; ninety-seven\r\nmembers of the Opposition and nine Government supporters voting for the\r\nMotion.[192]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Mr. Steadman's third demand for a Select Committee_]\r\n\r\nOn April 27, 1900, Mr. Steadman moved the reduction of the Postmaster\r\nGeneral's salary by $2,500.[193] He said: \"I rise for the purpose of\r\nadvocating the claims of the 160,000 persons employed in the Post\r\nOffice for a fair and impartial Committee of Inquiry to be elected by\r\nthis House to look into their grievances.\"\r\n\r\nThe contention that there were grievances, Mr. Steadman supported\r\nwith the following arguments. From 1881 to 1891, the Civil Service\r\nCommissioners, in issuing notices that they would hold competitive\r\nexaminations for intending entrants into the telegraph service, had\r\nstated that in London telegraphists had \"a prospect of obtaining\r\n[ultimately] $950 a year.\" That, argued Mr. Steadman, was a contract\r\nbetween the Government and the telegraphists who entered the London\r\nservice between 1881 and 1891, that every such telegraphist should\r\nrise to $950. The Government therefore had committed a breach of\r\ncontract when, in 1892, it had announced that good character and good\r\nskill as an operator would not secure a telegraphist promotion to the\r\nsenior class, in which the salary rose from $800 a year to $950. To be\r\neligible for promotion to the senior class, a man must be not only an\r\nexcellent telegraphist, but must, in addition, possess such executive\r\nability as would enable him to act as an overseer, or as assistant to\r\nthe Assistant Superintendent.\r\n\r\nMr. Steadman continued: \"Now I come to the question of the postmen.\r\nGoodness knows where all that $1,950,000 a year has gone to. You cannot\r\nget away from the fact that the postman to-day in London commences\r\n[at the age of 16 years to 18 years] with a minimum wage of $4.50 a\r\nweek.... Fancy that, Mr. Chairman, a man commencing on $4.50 a week,\r\nand employed by the State in a Department that has a clean profit of\r\nbetween $15,000,000 and $20,000,000.\" Mr. Steadman next contended that\r\na good conduct stripe--worth $13 a year--should be given every three\r\nyears; that the present period of five years was too long. Moreover,\r\nthe Department was altogether too rigorous in withholding good conduct\r\nstripes for breaches of discipline. Mr. Steadman cited the following\r\ninstances to prove the necessity of an inquiry by Members of the House\r\nof Commons into the discipline enforced by the Department. A man who\r\nhad served nine years as an auxiliary postman had been arrested on the\r\ncharge of stealing a postal money order. Though found not guilty by the\r\nCourt, he had been dismissed, without a certificate of good character.\r\nPostman Taylor, of Stirling, after suffering an accident, was unable\r\nto cover his route in the time fixed by the Post Office. Thereupon the\r\nlocal postmaster had asked Taylor to retire on a pension. \"The latest\r\ninformation that I have in regard to that case is that the man who is\r\nnow doing Taylor's duties, in order to get through his round in the\r\ntime allotted, has his son to help him.\" Again, the annual increment\r\nhad been withheld from one Lacon, a telegraphist at Birmingham, and\r\nthe local Secretary of the Postal Telegraph Clerks' Association. The\r\nSecretary to the Treasury, Mr. Hanbury, had told Mr. Steadman that the\r\nSuperintendent at Birmingham reported that Lacon's increment had been\r\nwithheld because Lacon had been insubordinate while on duty. Lacon\r\nhad told Mr. Steadman that he had been disciplined because of his\r\nconnection with the union. Mr. Steadman added: \"I will not for one\r\nmoment attempt to stand up in the House and attack permanent officials\r\nwho are not able to defend themselves; it would be unmanly for me to do\r\nso. But I do say that I have as much right to believe the statement of\r\nLacon, as the Right Honorable Gentleman [the Secretary to the Treasury]\r\nhas to believe the statement of the Birmingham Superintendent. There\r\nis only one way of proving these cases, and that is for a Committee\r\nof impartial Members of this House to be appointed before which the\r\npermanent official can state his case and the men theirs. If that is\r\ndone, the Members, if their minds are unbiased, will very soon be able\r\nto judge as to who is telling the truth.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Commons reminded of Civil Servants' votes_]\r\n\r\nSir Albert Rollit seconded Mr. Steadman's Motion, saying: \"and we ought\r\nnot to overlook the fact, that, rightly or wrongly, these men now have\r\nvotes, and if they cannot obtain redress for their grievances here in\r\nthe House of Commons, they will try to obtain it from our masters, the\r\nelectorate.\"\r\n\r\nMr. R. W. Hanbury, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, and\r\nrepresentative in the House of Commons of the Postmaster General,\r\nthe Duke of Norfolk, \"on principle\" opposed the request for a Select\r\nCommittee. \"Well, I say that the House of Commons is the last body\r\nwhich ought to interfere in these questions of the payment of our\r\npublic servants. It is the last body which ought to be appealed to\r\nas regularly as it is by civil servants to raise their salaries,\r\nbecause that, after all, is the real object of this proposed committee.\r\nAlready I think the pressure brought to bear on individual Members,\r\nand especially on Members who have a large number of civil servants\r\nin their constituencies, has become perfectly intolerable, and civil\r\nservants may depend upon it that it is the general opinion in this\r\nHouse, although they may have their cause advocated by Members upon\r\nwhom they may be able to bring particular pressure, because large\r\nnumbers of them happen to live in the constituencies of those Members;\r\nI repeat that they may depend upon it that in the opinion of the great\r\nbody of the Members of this House they are taking a highly irregular\r\ncourse, and are in no way making their position more favorable in\r\nthe minds of the great majority of Members. Nothing will induce me\r\npersonally to agree to any committee such as has been suggested. And\r\nwhile I object on principle, I object also because absolutely no\r\nnecessity has been shown for the committee.... The Duke of Norfolk and\r\nI, because we were so desirous that no case of the slightest grievance\r\nshould be left untouched, inquired into every grievance which was\r\nsaid to have been left unredressed by the Tweedmouth Committee....\r\nEvery Member of the House had a right to attend our [Norfolk-Hanbury\r\nCommittee] meetings, and to cross-examine the witnesses.... It is\r\nthe intention of the Post Office and of the Treasury to carry out\r\nthe recommendations of the Tweedmouth Committee to the very fullest\r\nextent, and if the honorable Member [Mr. Steadman] is able to show me\r\nany case whatever in which that has not been done, even in the case of\r\nan individual postman, or sorter, or telegraphist, I will go into it\r\nmyself, and I will do more: I will promise that the grievance shall be\r\nredressed.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Steadman's Motion was lost by a vote of 66 to 46. It was supported\r\nby forty-one members of the Opposition and by four supporters of the\r\nGovernment.[194]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn June 7, 1901, while the House of Commons was in Committee of Supply,\r\nMr. Thomas Bayley[195] asked for a Select Committee of the House of\r\nCommons to investigate the grievance of the Post Office servants.[196]\r\nHe said: \"This House shows a want of moral courage by throwing the\r\nresponsibility for redressing the grievance of the Post Office servants\r\non the other House [Lord Tweedmouth] or the permanent officials of any\r\nDepartment whatsoever.\" Mr. Bayley had begun his political career as a\r\nTown Councillor in Nottingham.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Prime Minister's Anxiety_]\r\n\r\nAfter many Members had supported the request for a Select Committee,\r\nthe Prime Minister, Mr. A. J. Balfour, said: \"I have listened\r\nwith great interest to this debate, and, I confess frankly, with\r\nconsiderable anxiety as to the future of the public service if\r\npressure of the kind which has been put upon the Government to-night\r\nis persisted in by this House. This House is omnipotent. It can make\r\nand unmake Governments. It can decide what, when, and how public money\r\nis to be spent. But with that omnipotence I would venture to urge upon\r\nMembers their great responsibility with a subject like this. Everyone\r\nknows that a great organized body like the Post Office Service has in\r\nits power to put great pressure upon Members, but I earnestly urge upon\r\nhonorable Gentlemen that unless we take our courage in both hands, and\r\nsay that, although most desirous that all legitimate grievances shall\r\nbe dealt with, we cannot permit the Government as a great employer of\r\nlabor to have this kind of pressure put upon it, I think the future of\r\nthe public service is in peril. I assure the committee that I speak\r\nwith a great sense of responsibility. In this very case the Post Office\r\nemployees have brought forward their grievances year after year. Two\r\nCommissions have been appointed, and no one ever ventured to impugn\r\nthe ability or impartiality of the members of those Commissions. These\r\nCommissions made the fullest examination into the case put before\r\nthem, and reported at length, and as a consequence of that report the\r\nBritish taxpayers are now paying $2,500,000 more of money than they\r\npaid before.... In none of the speeches has any specific complaint\r\nbeen brought forward, or any point urged which suggests the necessity\r\nfor further inquiry, but only the statement that there is a feeling\r\nof uneasiness, and a desire for further examination, and that when\r\nsuch a desire is expressed, the House should listen to it. We cannot\r\nkeep the Civil Service in a sound and healthy condition if we are\r\ngoing to examine into it by a committee every five years. If the House\r\nof Commons were to yield to the very natural temptation of granting\r\na committee such as had been asked for, though we might escape an\r\ninconvenient division, we should be unworthy, in my opinion, of bearing\r\nany longer the great responsibility of being the enormous employer\r\nof labor that we are. We should not be carrying out our duty to the\r\npublic, and, worst of all, we should aim a blow at the Civil Service,\r\nwhich is the boast of this country and the envy of the civilized\r\nworld, because we should become the parliamentary creatures of every\r\norganized body of public servants who chose to use the great power\r\nwhich the Constitution gives, for ends which I am sure they believe to\r\nbe right, but which this House could not yield to in the manner now\r\nsuggested without derogating from the high functions and spirit of pure\r\nimpartiality which the House must maintain if Members are to do their\r\nduty by their constituents.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bayley's Motion was lost by a vote of 148 to 103; it being\r\nsupported by ninety-one members of the Opposition and nine Government\r\nsupporters.[197]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Captain Norton demands a Select Committee_]\r\n\r\nOn April 18, 1902, while the House of Commons was in Committee of\r\nSupply, Captain Norton[198] moved the reduction by $500 of the item:\r\nSalaries and Working Expenses of the Post Office Telegraph Service:\r\n$12,056,250.[199] He said: \"The case briefly was this, that the\r\nGovernment had been guilty of a distinct breach of faith in connection\r\nwith a certain number of worthy Government officials. He knew that\r\nto make this statement of breach of faith was what must be called a\r\nstrong order, but he was prepared to prove that he was not exaggerating\r\nin the smallest degree.\" He went on to state that the telegraphists\r\nwho entered the service in London in 1881 to 1891, when the Civil\r\nService Commissioners had advertised that entrants had \"a prospect of\r\nobtaining $950,\" had a contract with the Government that the possession\r\nof \"ordinary manipulative ability, with regular attendance and good\r\nconduct\" would insure advancement to a position paying $950. The\r\nGovernment had broken that contract by prescribing, in 1892, that men\r\n\"must be equal to supervising duties\" in order to be promoted to the\r\npositions carrying $950.\r\n\r\nSir Albert Rollit[200] supported Captain Norton with the words: \"For\r\na long time past there had been a very strong and general feeling in\r\nthe service that many of the men had been the victims of something\r\namounting almost to an imposition, however unintentional, on the part\r\nof a public Department. Strong terms had been used in the course of the\r\ndebate, but he should endeavor to deal with the matter on the basis of\r\nwhat he believed to have been a contract between those employees and\r\nthe Post Office. It was not difficult to show that that implied--or,\r\nhe might even say, express--contract had induced many to enter the\r\nservice, only to find that the contract was afterward departed from by\r\none of the contracting parties, the State.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Keir Hardie supported Captain Norton's Motion with the argument\r\nthat the concessions made by the Tweedmouth Committee had imposed no\r\nadditional burdens upon the taxpayers, for that committee merely had\r\nallocated a small portion of the extra profit made by the Post Office\r\nto the Post Office servants who made that profit. Mr. Keir Hardie at\r\none time has held the office of Chairman of the Independent Labor\r\nParty,[201] an organization that brings to bear upon the British\r\nmunicipal governments a pressure similar to that here shown to be\r\nbrought upon the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Members of Parliament coerced_]\r\n\r\nMr. Gibson Bowles said: \"He was aware that many honorable Members who\r\nbrought forward the position of servants of the State, did so against\r\ntheir own desires, because of the almost irresistible pressure placed\r\nupon them by the servants of the State, who were at the same time\r\nelectors.... He supported the Secretary to the Treasury in resisting\r\nthis particular amendment, because it was one of many which tended to\r\nillustrate a form of tyranny that was becoming unbearable, and which\r\ntended seriously to injure the character of this House as making its\r\nMembers the advocates of classes, sections, and little communities,\r\ninstead of being trustees not for them alone, but for the whole\r\ncommunity.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Austen Chamberlain, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, and\r\nrepresentative in the House of Commons of the Postmaster General, the\r\nMarquis of Londonderry, said he \"supposed it would not be unfair to say\r\nthat an officer joining the British Army had a prospect of becoming\r\na field marshal.\" As to the telegraphists, \"all that the Government\r\never had held out to them was a prospect of a certain number of them\r\nattaining something beyond the ordinary maximum\" of $800, to which any\r\nman could rise by the display of ordinary manipulative ability and the\r\nobservance of good conduct. Under Mr. Fawcett, in 1881 to 1884, one\r\ntelegraphist out of every 6.3 telegraphists had risen beyond $800. In\r\n1890 the proportion in question had been exactly the same. In 1902, the\r\nproportion was one in six, or, \"practically the same.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Austen Chamberlain continued: \"When I consider the great\r\nconcessions that were made [by the Tweedmouth Committee], and the great\r\nburden that was placed upon the taxpayers, the care that was given to\r\nthat inquiry, and the opportunity that was afforded to every one to\r\nhave their grievances heard, I cannot pretend to think that a case has\r\nbeen made out for trying, not fresh matters, but for retrying the same\r\nmatters and changing the tribunal, merely because all its decisions\r\n[_i. e._, some of its decisions] were not agreeable to one of the\r\nparties concerned. I hope the House will not do anything so fatal to\r\nthe efficiency and the organization of our Civil Service, as to allow\r\nany large body of civil servants to think that they have only to be\r\nimportunate enough to secure in this House repeated inquiries into\r\ntheir grievances, no matter what previous care has been given to their\r\nconsideration. I trust this House will have confidence in the desire\r\nof the Postmaster General to deal fairly with all his employees, and\r\nbelieve me when I say that there is nothing easier for us to do than to\r\ngive way; and that it is only because we believe it to be our duty to\r\nthe taxpayers that we find it necessary to refuse these recurring and\r\nincreasing demands.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Norton's Motion was lost by a vote of 164 to 134. It was\r\nsupported by one hundred and twenty-three Opposition members, and by\r\nseven Government supporters.[202]\r\n\r\nA few hours later, Mr. Thomas Bayley[203] moved a reduction of $500 on\r\nthe salary of the Postmaster General, in order to call attention to\r\nthe grievances of the officials of the Post Office.[204] He said there\r\nshould be a Court of Appeal for the civil servants, and that Court\r\nshould be the House of Commons alone; whenever a dispute arose between\r\nthe Government of the day and its servants, the House should constitute\r\nitself the Court of Appeal. Mr. Bayley added: \"It had been distinctly\r\nlaid down that it was no part of the duty of the Post Office to make\r\na profit, but it should be worked for the future convenience of the\r\npublic and not reduced to the level of a mere profit making machine. It\r\nwas this desire on the part of the Post Office officials to make profit\r\nwhich lay at the root of all the troubles which the House had been\r\ndiscussing in the debate that evening.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Austen Chamberlain, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, and\r\nrepresentative, in the House of Commons, of the Postmaster General,\r\nreplied: \"I refuse to resign one particle of my responsibility, or\r\nto accept the suggestion that the Government should wash their hands\r\nof their responsibility, and throw the subject, as an open question,\r\nbefore the House of Commons, and ask a Committee of this House,\r\nwithout aid or guidance from responsible Ministers, to judge upon\r\nthe multitude of conflicting interests and details incident to the\r\nadministration of so great a service as the Post Office. I, for one,\r\nwill not be party to putting off that responsibility on to the House\r\nof Commons.... But we consider that it would be a grave dereliction\r\nof duty on our part to throw this great service into the turmoil and\r\nconfusion of a Parliamentary inquiry, with the knowledge that such an\r\ninquiry would not be final--honorable Gentlemen who have supported this\r\nAmendment have declared that to talk about finality in this matter\r\nis absurd--with the knowledge that what is done to-day for the Post\r\nOffice, must be done to-morrow for every other Department employing a\r\nlarge number of Government servants, until elections to this House\r\nwill depend more and more on the willingness of Members to purchase\r\nthe support of those who are in public employment by promises of\r\nconcessions at the public expense, instead of securing their support,\r\nlike that of other citizens, on public grounds and national interests.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Government's Compromise_]\r\n\r\nOn April 30, 1903, while the House was in Committee of Supply, Mr.\r\nAusten Chamberlain, Postmaster General, prefaced the discussion\r\nby the Committee of the Post Office Vote, with the following\r\nstatement:[205].... \"The demand is that a Select Committee of this\r\nHouse should be appointed to examine into the grievances of the Post\r\nOffice staff. I have made it my business since I have been at the post\r\noffice to see that every memorial from the staff dealing with their\r\ngrievances, addressed to me, should come before me personally....\r\nEven though I have felt that many of the matters thus brought to my\r\nnotice were very small details of administration. I am determined\r\nthat an official [employee] of the Post Office, going to the head of\r\nhis service, should receive as fair and careful consideration of his\r\nappeal, if he applies to me direct, as if he sought Parliamentary\r\ninfluence to urge his claim. And I venture to think that nothing has\r\noccurred during the time that I have been responsible which can\r\njustify any servant of the Post Office in saying that he is unable,\r\nexcept by Parliamentary influence, or by Parliamentary exposure, to\r\nobtain the attention of the head of the Department. The other day at\r\nthe request of several Members on both sides of the House, I met the\r\nMembers themselves, and consented that if they wished, they should\r\nbe accompanied by members of the Post Office Staff, who should make\r\nbefore them, and in my presence, a statement of the grounds on which\r\nthey asked for this inquiry by a Select Committee, in order that then\r\nand there I might discuss it with my honorable friends. The Vote comes\r\non to-night, and I intend to take this opportunity of making a few\r\nobservations on the grounds for this Parliamentary inquiry as put forth\r\nby the Staff. There are three main grounds alleged by the spokesman\r\nfor the staff for a Parliamentary inquiry--wages, sanitation [_i.\r\ne._, the sanitary condition of certain offices], and meal reliefs, or\r\nthe time allowed out of working hours for taking refreshment. If a\r\nperson does eight hours' continuous work he is allowed half an hour\r\nout of that time for a meal, reducing his actual working hours to\r\nseven and a half hours.... I only wish to draw the attention of the\r\ncommittee to what was described to me as a typical grievance by the\r\nspokesman of a deputation which waited on me shortly before Christmas.\r\nCertain men are on duty from 10 a. m. to 2 p. m., and from 4 p. m.\r\nto 8 p. m., and complain because they are not allowed 20 minutes for\r\ntea. In the judgment of any impartial person, was that a reasonable\r\ngrievance?... I myself have come to the conclusion, ... that while a\r\ngreat number of the complaints made have no foundation in justice, and\r\nthat a great number of the men who think themselves aggrieved would\r\nfind it difficult to get, elsewhere than in the public service, such\r\ngood employment as they have now, there are other cases which are\r\nopen to improvement and for which further inquiry is needed to fix\r\nexactly what should be done. The Government is unalterably opposed\r\nto a Select Committee of the House of Commons for the decision of\r\nthis question. Honorable Members know, and it is no use blinking it,\r\nthe kind of pressure which is brought to bear, or is attempted to be\r\nbrought to bear, upon Members in all parts of the House by the public\r\nservants, servants of the Post Office, I am afraid, especially, though\r\nnot entirely [exclusively], at election times. I have had Members come\r\nto me, not from one side of the House alone, to seek from me, in my\r\nposition as Postmaster General, protection for them in the discharge\r\nof their public duties against the pressure sought to be put upon them\r\nby the employees of the Post Office. Even if the machinery by which\r\nour Select Committees are appointed were such as would enable us to\r\nsecure a Select Committee composed of thoroughly impartial men who had\r\ncommitted themselves by no expression of opinion, I still think that it\r\nwould not be fair to pick out fifteen Members of this House and make\r\nthem marked men for the purposes of such pressure as is now distributed\r\nmore or less over the whole Assembly. But if I am opposed to the\r\nappointment of a House of Commons Committee for fixing wages in the\r\nPost Office, I am still more opposed to thrusting upon it, or, indeed,\r\non any Committee, the duty of regulating in all its details the daily\r\nadministration and work of the Post Office. The wages paid are not\r\nin all respects satisfactory, some are too low, others are too high.\r\nAdvice from men of practical and business experience would help me, the\r\nMinister in this matter. Therefore, I propose to take such advice--of\r\nmen as free from any kind of political and electoral pressure, as they\r\nshould be free from any departmental influence. I should suggest a body\r\nof five to report for my advice and information on the wages paid in\r\nthe Post Office Department to the four great classes of employees, the\r\nletter sorters and the telegraphists in London, and the letter sorters\r\nand the telegraphists in the provinces.\"\r\n\r\nAfter reiterating that he proposed to get the advice of business men\r\nonly on the question of the scale of wages paid in the Post Office\r\nDepartment, and that he in no way proposed to surrender to any\r\nCommittee of any sort the general duties of the Postmaster General,\r\nMr. Austen Chamberlain closed with the words: \"I ask the Committee [of\r\nSupply] to give me all the confidence it can, and when it is unable to\r\ngive me that confidence, I say that that is no reason for granting a\r\nSelect Committee to do my work, but only a reason for transferring the\r\noffice of Postmaster General to someone who is more competent.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas Bayley replied that \"he was not willing to give up the\r\nrights and privileges of the House of Commons, whose duty it was\r\nto remedy the grievances of the public service.... And although he\r\nhad been assured by those whom he represented [_i. e._, post office\r\nservants] that the Post Office officials would loyally abide by the\r\ndecision of a Committee of the House of Commons, the Right Honorable\r\nGentleman [the Postmaster General] could not expect the same loyalty\r\nwith regard to the decision of the Committee he proposed to appoint.\"\r\n\r\nSir Albert Rollit said: \"The Tweedmouth Committee was a one-sided\r\ntribunal; the officials were represented on it, but the men not at\r\nall....\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Norton replied: \"The Right Honorable Gentleman had also\r\nreferred to the question of Members on both sides of the House coming\r\nto him for protection. That was very startling, because the reason\r\nthey were there at all was that they might represent every section of\r\ntheir constituents,[206] ... but presuming the Post Office servants\r\nwere organized, he submitted they were within their rights to appeal\r\nto their Members.... If the postal officials were such terrible tyrants\r\nhe hoped they would take note that they could never hope for fair\r\nplay from the present Government. The Right Honorable Gentleman had\r\nappointed a packed jury of five individuals to deal with a fraction of\r\nthe question.... In other words, he was going to take shelter behind\r\nthis bogus committee.... He was going to appoint five Members, possibly\r\nsweaters, to determine the rate of wages.... It would be astounding if\r\nthe postal officials accepted any such bogus arbitration. If it was\r\nto be a Board of Arbitration, why should not they have five postal\r\nservants added to the five employers of labor?\" Captain Norton is a\r\nJunior Lord of the Treasury in the present Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman\r\nMinistry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn May 17, 1903, the National Joint Committee of the Postal Association\r\nunanimously resolved: \"That this National Joint Committee views\r\nwith extreme dissatisfaction the appointment of a Court of Inquiry\r\nwhich is not composed of members of Parliament, but is an altogether\r\nirresponsible body, and protests against the scope of the inquiry\r\nbeing limited to a single grievance and to a minority of the Staff. It\r\npledges itself to continue to use every legitimate endeavor to obtain\r\nan impartial Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry into the causes of\r\ndiscontent in the postal and telegraph service.\"[207]\r\n\r\nIn August, 1903, the Postmaster General appointed a \"Committee to\r\ninquire into the adequacy of the wages paid to certain classes of the\r\npostal servants.\" The Committee consisted of: Sir Edward Bradford,\r\nuntil lately Chief Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police; Mr. Charles\r\nBooth, a Liverpool Merchant, and the author of \"The Life and Labor of\r\nthe People in London;\" Mr. Samuel Fay, General Manager of the Great\r\nCentral Railway; Mr. Thomas Brodrick, Secretary of the Co-operative\r\nWholesale Society, Manchester; and Mr. R.

It recommends\r\n     measures that would cost $6,500,000 a year, in the hope of\r\n     satisfying the postal employees, who had asked for $12,500,000\r\n     a year. Lord Stanley, Postmaster General, rejects the Bradford\r\n     Committee's Report; but grants increases in wages and salaries\r\n     aggregating $1,861,500 a year.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter it was stated that the Government in August,\r\n1903, appointed Sir Edward Bradford, Mr. Charles Booth, Mr. Thomas\r\nBrodrick, Mr. R. Burbidge, and Mr. Samuel Fay a Committee \"to inquire\r\ninto the scales of pay received by the undermentioned classes of\r\nEstablished Post Office Servants, and to report whether, having regard\r\nto the conditions of their employment and to the rates current in other\r\noccupations, the remuneration of (a) Postmen, (b) Sorters (London),\r\n(c) Telegraphists (London), (d) Sorting Clerks and Telegraphists\r\n(Provincial) is adequate.\" No further question was submitted to the\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\nThe Committee, in May, 1904, reported: \"We have not seen our way to\r\nobtain any specific evidence as to the comparative rates of wages\r\ncurrent in other occupations. So far as regards this portion of the\r\nreference to us,[209] we came to the conclusion that no really useful\r\npurpose would be served by asking employers of labor to furnish precise\r\ndetails of the wages paid by them. Certain official information is\r\nalready available, being obtained and published from time to time\r\nby the Board of Trade. This information, supplemented by our own\r\nexperience, affords more reliable data than any particulars we could\r\nhope to obtain in the way of evidence within the limits of an inquiry\r\nof reasonable duration.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Business Methods not applicable in State Service_]\r\n\r\n\"Moreover, it is difficult to make any valid comparison between a\r\nNational Postal Service and any form of private industrial employment,\r\nthe entire conditions being necessarily so different; payment by\r\nresults and promotion or dismissal according to the will of the\r\nemployer being inapplicable if not impossible under the State.\"[210]\r\n\r\nThe Committee's report covers nineteen pages, but only these two\r\nparagraphs are in answer to the reference given to the Committee. In\r\nthem the Committee reports its failure; and with that report of failure\r\nthe Committee should have contented itself, under all of the rules\r\nof procedure governing Committees and Commissions appointed by the\r\nBritish Government. But the Committee ignored the established rules of\r\nprocedure, roamed about at will, and reopened many of the questions\r\nsettled by the Tweedmouth Committee, which had sat two years, and had\r\ntaken upward of a thousand closely printed folio pages of evidence.\r\nThe Bradford Committee did this in violation of the established usage\r\nof the country, as well as in spite of the fact that Mr. Austen\r\nChamberlain, Postmaster General, had closed the speech in which he\r\nannounced his resolve to appoint the Committee, with the words that he\r\nwanted advice on the question of comparative wages only and that he\r\nrefused to transfer to \"any Committee the duty of regulating in all its\r\ndetails the daily administration and work of the Post Office.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the Report of the Committee, _The Economist_[211] (London)\r\ncommented as follows: \"This Committee was asked to compare the wages\r\nof Post Office servants with those paid for corresponding work\r\noutside. Their answer was, in effect, that no such comparison could\r\nbe instituted. Why, when postal servants are taken from various\r\nascertained classes [of society], it should be impossible to compare\r\ntheir pay with that ordinarily received by the same classes in other\r\nemployments is not obvious. What is obvious is that the Committee\r\neither mistook the inquiry entrusted to them, or did not choose to\r\nenter upon it.\"\r\n\r\n_The Times_[212] said: \"The reference here is explicit, ...\r\nThe specific question they were asked was the question to which, as\r\nour Correspondent says, the taxpayer really wants an answer--namely,\r\nare postal servants fairly paid ...? This question the Committee has\r\nneither answered nor attempted to answer. Passing by the terms of\r\nreference altogether, the Report declares that 'it is difficult'....\r\nBut, as an answer to the specific question addressed to the Committee;\r\nit is, in our judgment, in the literal sense of the word, impertinent.\r\nHowever, having rejected the criterion propounded to them by the\r\nPostmaster General, the Committee proposed to apply a criterion of\r\ntheir own....\" The Committee made some general statements as to the\r\nrates of wages that should prevail in the public service. They were:\r\n\"We think that Postal employees are justified in resting their claims\r\nto remuneration on the responsible and exacting[213] character of the\r\nduties performed and on the social position they fill as servants of\r\nthe State. The State, for its part, does right in taking an independent\r\ncourse guided by principles of its own, irrespective of what others may\r\ndo; neither following an example nor pretending to set one. It must\r\nalways be remembered that in the working of a monopoly by the State,\r\nthe interest of the public as a whole is the paramount consideration,\r\nand every economy consistent with efficiency must be adopted. The terms\r\noffered by the State should, however, be such as to secure men and\r\nwomen of the requisite character and capacity and ought to be such as\r\nwill insure the response of hearty service.\" If one seeks to find in\r\nthe foregoing statements an answer to the very matter-of-fact question\r\nwhether the postal servants' wages are too high or too low, compared\r\nwith wages in outside employment, he will have to conclude, with _Alice\r\nin Wonderland_, that \"it seems very pretty, but it's rather hard to\r\nunderstand; somehow it seems to fill my head with ideas, only I don't\r\nknow exactly what they are.\"\r\n\r\nThe Committee concluded with the statement that the adequacy of the\r\nwages obtaining among the postal employees could be tested by the\r\nnumbers and character of those who offered themselves; by the capacity\r\nthey showed on trial; and finally, by their contentment. It found that\r\nthere was no lack of suitable candidates; that there was no complaint\r\nas to their capacity; but that there was widespread discontent. It\r\nadded that the Tweedmouth and Norfolk-Hanbury settlements did not\r\ngive satisfaction at the time; and that that dissatisfaction had been\r\n\"aggravated by the general rise in wages and prices and in the standard\r\nof life which took place to some extent even during the two years\r\noccupied by the Tweedmouth inquiry (1895 and 1896) and had continued\r\nsince, culminating, however, in 1900, since when there has been some\r\nslight reaction. The same period has seen a great development of Postal\r\nand Telegraph business, causing greater pressure of work. This has been\r\ncombined with lower charges to the public and a considerable increase\r\nin Postal Revenue. We therefore consider there is a just claim for\r\nrevision.\"\r\n\r\nTaking these statements in their order, one finds, first of all,\r\nthat the Committee took no evidence on the question how Post Office\r\nwages had compared with wages in outside employment previous to the\r\nrise in wages and prices in the period from 1895 to 1900, nor on the\r\nquestion of the rise in wages in the Post Office Service in 1896\r\nto 1900, compared with the rise in wages in outside employment and\r\nin prices in 1895 to 1900. The first statement of the Committee,\r\ntherefore, was supported by no evidence, it was a mere assertion. The\r\nsecond statement, namely, that the growth of the Postal and Telegraph\r\nbusiness had caused greater pressure of work, also was not supported\r\nby evidence. On the other hand, it was absolutely essential that such\r\na statement should be supported by evidence, because it is a fact that\r\nin both branches of the Postal Service the policy obtains of having so\r\nlarge a body of employees \"that the maximum of work, as a rule, can be\r\ndealt with without undue pressure.\"[214] As to the Post Office having\r\nlowered its charges to the public in the period from 1895 to 1900, it\r\nis to be said, first, that it does not follow therefrom that wages\r\nshould be raised; and second, that the penny rate on domestic letters\r\nwas not lowered, and that the carriage of penny letters is the only\r\nwork upon which the Post Office makes a profit.[215] Finally, as to\r\nthe statement that there had been, in 1895 to 1904, \"a considerable\r\nincrease in Postal Revenue,\" the facts are, first, that the net\r\nrevenue of the Post Office as a whole increased from $14,640,000 in\r\n1895, to $18,166,000 in 1896, and to $18,781,000 in 1897; but that\r\nin the subsequent years, 1898 to 1904, it did not again reach the\r\nhigh-water mark of 1897, and averaged $17,642,000. Second, that in the\r\nperiod, from 1895 to 1904, the Telegraph Branch did not earn operating\r\nexpenses, the expenses on account of wages and salaries having risen\r\nfrom 11.9 cents per telegram in 1897, to 13.7 cents in 1904. That is a\r\nmatter of importance, for the recommendations of the Committee extended\r\nto the Telegraph Branch as well as to the Postal Branch proper.\r\nAgain, the Committee had stated that \"in the working of a monopoly\r\nby the State, the interest of the public as a whole is the paramount\r\nconsideration, and every economy consistent with efficiency must be\r\nadopted.\" In the 20 years ending with 1903, the proportion of the Post\r\nOffice's gross revenue available for defraying the general expenses of\r\nthe State had declined steadily from 33 per cent. to 20 per cent.[216]\r\nStill, again, in the year 1903, the expenses of the Post Office had\r\nbeen increased by $3,000,000 through the Tweedmouth and Norfolk-Hanbury\r\nsettlements.[217] In the face of those facts, the Bradford Committee\r\nmade recommendations that Lord Stanley, Postmaster General, said\r\nwould cost $6,500,000 a year.[218] The Bradford Committee sought to\r\njustify its recommendations with the simple statement that there\r\nwas \"widespread discontent\" among the Postal employees. The Postal\r\nemployees themselves had made demands before the Committee that would\r\nhave called for the expenditure of an additional $12,500,000 a year.\r\nTheir attitude to the Committee's amiable proposal to conciliate them\r\nby giving them $6,500,000 a year, is shown in the subjoined extract\r\nfrom the official organ of the telegraph staff. \"It is perfectly plain,\r\n... that the recommendations of the Committee, well-meaning as we\r\nfrankly admit them to be, cannot be accepted as a full settlement of\r\nthe case of the Post Office workers, or as one carrying with it the\r\ncharacter of finality. They can only be accepted as an instalment of a\r\nlong overdue account; and Postal Telegraphists, even if they have to\r\nfight alone for their own hand in the future as they did for many long\r\nyears in the past, will combine for the payment of the balance.\"[219]\r\n\r\nThat a body of five men, of whom four were respectively a Liverpool\r\nmerchant and ship owner, a general manager of a railway, a manager\r\nof a large wholesale coöperative society, and a manager of a large\r\ndepartment store, could make a Report such as the foregoing one,\r\naffords a melancholy illustration of the fact that no matter how far\r\npopular governments may go in assuming the conduct of great business\r\nenterprises, they never will succeed in creating a public opinion that\r\nwill sustain them in their efforts to conduct their business ventures\r\non the commonly accepted principles of the business world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the House of Commons, Lord Stanley, the Postmaster General,\r\nsaid: \"As to the Committee's Report, it did not comply with the\r\nreference, because no comparison was made with the rates of pay in\r\nother occupations ... but they conclude that as there was discontent\r\nthere ought to be an increase of wages. That was a direct premium\r\non discontent, a direct encouragement to the employees to say among\r\nthemselves that if they were to be discontented and to agitate, they\r\nwould get more in the future. The Committee, on the other hand, went\r\noutside the reference, because they proposed a complete reorganization\r\nof the Post Office, including overseers, who were not referred to in\r\nthe reference. On this particular subject they took no evidence....\r\nSince the employees of the Post Office had said in a circular: 'We\r\nwish to make it perfectly clear that we do not regard the Committee\r\nas in any sense an arbitration board,' that was rather against the\r\nargument that the Report ought to be accepted as an arbitration award.\r\nHe did not complain of the ordinary circulars of the employees [sent\r\nto Members of Parliament], but he did object to one circular [sent to\r\nevery Member of the House of Commons], at the bottom of which was a\r\nparagraph, which could be torn off, for Members to sign [and mail to\r\nthe Postmaster General], informing him [the Postmaster General] that\r\nhe ought to do this or that.[220] That [circular] he [Lord Stanley]\r\nwould not receive.... Coming to the main question, he thought it was\r\nobvious that it was impossible for either side when in power to go on\r\nfor long being swayed in all these questions of increases of wages by\r\nany pressure, political or otherwise, that might be put upon them.\r\n[Cheers.] The Post Office was not the only party concerned. There was\r\nnot a class employed by the Government, who, if it saw another class\r\ngetting an increase of wages by agitation, would not try the same\r\nmethod. He supported cordially the suggestion which had been made in\r\nthe debate that all questions of pay of employees of the Government\r\nshould not be referred to the House, but referred to some judicial body\r\non whom no outside influence could be brought to bear, who would look\r\nat the matter in dispute as between employer and employee with the\r\nobject of giving to the employee the wages which in the open market\r\na good employer would give, while at the same time protecting the\r\nmaster--in this case the State--from any outside influence.\"[221] In\r\nconclusion, Lord Stanley made the statement that the adoption of the\r\nCommittee's Report would cost \"well over $5,000,000 a year.\"\r\n\r\nSir Albert Rollit acted as the spokesman of the Postal employees. He\r\nis a Solicitor in Mincing Lane and at Hull; a steamship owner at Hull,\r\nNewcastle and London; and a Director in the National Telephone Company,\r\nwhich pays its employees materially less than the Post Office pays\r\nthe employees of the Post Office Telephone system.[222] He has been\r\nPresident of the Associated Chambers of Commerce of the United Kingdom,\r\nas well as of the London and Hull Chambers of Commerce. He was Mayor\r\nof Hull from 1883 to 1885; and for several years past he has been the\r\nPresident of the Association of Municipal Corporations. Sir Albert\r\nK. Rollit was not re-elected to Parliament in the General Election\r\nof January, 1906; and in the following March, the Postal Telegraph\r\nClerks' Association passed a resolution \"expressing appreciation of\r\nthe services rendered to the Postal movement in and out of Parliament\r\nby Sir Albert K. Rollit, and regret that they were no longer able to\r\ncommand his championship in the House of Commons.\"[223]\r\n\r\nAfter the Balfour Government had rejected the Report of the Bradford\r\nCommittee, in the interest of the taxpayers, Lord Stanley, Postmaster\r\nGeneral, instituted \"a careful comparison between Post Office\r\nwages and those current in other employments; and, as the result\r\nof the comparison, he felt justified in recommending to the Lords\r\nCommissioners of His Majesty's Treasury certain improvements of pay\"\r\naggregating $1,861,500 a year.[224] The improvements of pay were\r\ngranted to sorters, telegraphists, sorting clerks and telegraphists,\r\npostmen, assistant and auxiliary postmen, and various smaller classes\r\nthroughout the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[209] There was no reference but that one.\r\n\r\n[210] _Report and Appendices of the Committee appointed to inquire into\r\nPost Office Wages_, 1904.\r\n\r\n[211] September 17, 1904.\r\n\r\n[212] September 12, 1904.\r\n\r\n[213] _Report of the Bradford Committee on Post Office Wages_, 1904, p.\r\n198.\r\n\r\nDr. A.

This Conference, therefore, calls upon\r\nthe Postmaster General to adopt immediately, as dated from May 9, 1904,\r\nthe whole of the ameliorative recommendations contained in the Bradford\r\nCommittee's Report; but the Postal Telegraph Clerks' Association\r\nreserves to itself the right to object to, and protest against, any\r\nrecommendations which may be considered by this Association to be of a\r\nrestrictive and retrograde character.\"[225]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A Merchant in Politics_]\r\n\r\nIn the evening of the same day a mass meeting was addressed by Mr. W.\r\nW. Rutherford, M. P., the head of the firm of Miller, Peel, Hughes and\r\nRutherford, Liverpool. Mr. Rutherford had been Lord Mayor of Liverpool\r\nin 1902. He said: \"He ventured to think that the great Postal and\r\nTelegraph Service was suffering because its position and its grievances\r\nhad not been made thoroughly intelligible to the general public....\r\nThat was not a matter touching a few hundreds of people in a hole and\r\ncorner of the country, but was one of extreme importance affecting no\r\nless than 185,000 people.... The real foes of the employees were the\r\nhighly paid officials at the head of the Department, who were quite\r\ncontent to draw their salaries and show that the Government was making\r\nfour or five million pounds sterling[226] out of the public and the\r\nPostal Service.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Rutherford's speech recalls to mind the fact that the Australian\r\ncousins of the British civil servants have learned to deal with their\r\n\"foes\" by compelling the popular branches of the Australian Parliaments\r\nto reduce the salaries of offensive officials, or to drive them out of\r\nthe Service by means of \"fishing\" Parliamentary Committees, appointed\r\nto report on--and to condemn--the offending officials.\r\n\r\nOn August 14, 1904, the London Branch of the Postal Telegraph Clerks'\r\nAssociation held a meeting, at which Mr. C. H. Garland,[227] the\r\nSecretary, spoke of Mr. Thomas Bayley, M. P., as one who \"had rendered\r\nvaluable service to their cause in the House of Commons.\" The presiding\r\nofficer, Mr. R. H. Davis, said: \"In burking the recommendations of the\r\nCommittee they could not help feeling that the Post Office authorities\r\nhad been guilty of a breach of faith. Were they going to take the\r\nrebuff lying down? The London Committee were determined to fight the\r\nmatter harder than ever. By the time Parliament assembled next year,\r\nthey would have an effective organization at their disposal, and the\r\nenemy would feel their pressure very considerably.\"[228]\r\n\r\nThe Special Conference of the Postal Telegraph Clerks' Association\r\nheld on September 17, 1904, resolved to hold mass meetings in all the\r\ndistrict centres between then and next February [opening of Parliament]\r\nto protest against the action of the Postmaster General. The series to\r\nconclude with a \"monster\" demonstration in London immediately before\r\nthe opening of Parliament.[229]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn July 6, 1905, while the House of Commons was in Committee of Supply,\r\nand was considering the vote upon the Post Office, there was a long\r\nand instructive debate upon the Report of the Bradford Committee.[230]\r\nLord Stanley, Postmaster General, opened the debate with a quotation\r\nfrom _The Post_,[231] the Post Office employees' organ. The statement\r\nquoted read: \"Not only do we object to the composition of the\r\n[Bradford] Committee, but we take the strongest exception to its terms\r\nof reference. The inquiry as to whether our wages are adequate or\r\notherwise becomes a farce if their adequacy is to be judged by the\r\nstandard of wages of the open labor market. No such comparison would be\r\nreasonable or fair. There is no other employer who fixes his own prices\r\nor makes an annual profit of $20,000,000. There is no other class of\r\nwork which can be compared to the Post Office work, neither any other\r\nemployee who can be compared with the Post Office servants.... Surely\r\nMr. Chamberlain does not think we should regard such an inquiry as\r\nfinal. If he does, the sooner his mind is disabused the better.\" Lord\r\nStanley next discussed the manner in which the Bradford Committee\r\nhad made recommendations which were based on no evidence whatever.\r\nFor instance, in order to improve the chances of promotion, the\r\nCommittee had recommended the creation of additional higher posts--\"for\r\nwhich there was no work.\" In one Department of the Post Office that\r\nrecommendation would mean the increase in the number of overseers from\r\n250 to 900. Lord Stanley next made lengthy comparisons between the\r\nwages received by letter sorters and telegraphists on the one hand,\r\nand employees of equal intelligence and attainments in the service\r\nof private companies on the other hand. He showed that in London the\r\nmaximum wage of the sorters and telegraphists was equal to the salary\r\nof the \"non-college-trained certified teacher,\" and that in such\r\nprovincial cities as Hull, Swansea and Exeter it was larger. \"The only\r\ncomparison which was not entirely upon his [the Postmaster General's]\r\nside was that with the clerks in the cable companies, who were paid\r\nmore than the Post Office cable room operators. But the work of the\r\ncable companies' operators was more arduous, and there was liability\r\nto be sent abroad at any moment. But he had granted the Post Office\r\ncable room operators an increase of pay.\" He added that the ultimate\r\naggregate cost of the increases in pay made since the publication of\r\nthe Bradford Committee's Report would be $642,000 a year.[232]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Postmaster General applies the Terms \"Blackmail\" and\r\n\"Blood-sucking\"_]\r\n\r\nLord Stanley, Postmaster General, concluded as follows: \"But he would\r\nask the House just to consider what was going to be the end of all\r\nthese demands. This was really a question worthy of consideration on\r\nboth sides of the House. What were the demands on the public purse\r\nfor this particular office? It would be within the recollection of\r\nthe Committee of Supply that at a deputation to his Right Honorable\r\nFriend and himself, one of the men stated that he thought the whole\r\nof the $20,000,000 profit, as he regarded it, made by the Post Office\r\nemployees, ought to be devoted to the payment of those employees ...\r\nthat man made a deliberate statement, not on his own account, but as\r\nrepresenting a particular section or organization in the Department.\r\nIt was repudiated by others present\".... Lord Stanley next stated that\r\nthe demands made by the Post Office employees before the Bradford\r\nCommittee would have called for $12,500,000 a year. He continued:\r\n\"Honorable Members knew better than he how they were being bombarded\r\nwith applications from Post Office employees and other classes of Civil\r\nServants for increases of wages. This had taken a form which was not\r\nillegal, but which he could not help thinking was an abuse of their\r\nrights, to wit, the form of a political threat. They had circulated\r\nan appeal in which they expressed very clearly and very frankly\r\ntheir intention, and it was one of which the Committee would have to\r\ntake note now, or it would be much worse in the future. They said:\r\n'Two-thirds at least of one political party are in great fear of losing\r\ntheir seats. The swing of the pendulum is against them, and any Member\r\nwho receives 40 or 50 such letters will under present circumstances\r\nhave to consider very seriously whether on this question he can afford\r\nto go into the wrong lobby. This is taking advantage of the political\r\nsituation.' It was indeed, but it was abusing, as it seemed to him,\r\ntheir rights as voters. It was nothing more nor less than blackmail.\r\nIt was nothing more nor less than asking Members to purchase votes for\r\nthemselves at the General Election[233] at the expense of the Public\r\nExchequer. Both sides would have to make up their minds that some\r\nmeans should be devised by which there should not be this continual\r\nblood-sucking on the part of the public servants.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A permanent non-political Tribunal suggested_]\r\n\r\n\"How it was to be done, was not for him to say, but he had suggested,\r\nand he still thought that there would have to be some organization\r\noutside party politics altogether, and unconnected with and unmoved by\r\nParliament and political considerations, to whom such questions should\r\nbe referred and by whom an impartial opinion should be given.... He\r\nwanted now rather to anticipate a request that would probably be made\r\nby Honorable Members opposite--that he should appoint a Parliamentary\r\nCommittee. To that request he would have to give a negative reply, and\r\nhe would say why. First, too great political pressure would be brought\r\nto bear on the Committee; second, the whole case of the Post Office\r\nemployees was before the House in the evidence taken by the Bradford\r\nCommittee, and everybody could make up his mind as well as he would be\r\nable to if appointed to a Select Committee. Third, he would not throw\r\nthe responsibility on to a Committee; it was his place to bear it\r\nhimself.\"\r\n\r\nOn July 18, Lord Stanley, Postmaster General, stated that he\r\nwould neither withdraw nor modify the epithets \"blackmail\" and\r\n\"blood-sucking\" which he had used. He stated that those epithets\r\napplied \"only to those who by speeches, letters or circulars, attempt\r\nunduly to influence the votes of Honorable Members with regard to the\r\nquestions affecting Post Office wages, and to those who associate\r\nthemselves with such action.\"[234]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Captain Norton on Civil Service Agitation_]\r\n\r\nAfter the Postmaster General had spoken, Captain Norton moved a\r\nreduction of the Post Office Vote, for the purpose of drawing attention\r\nto the grievances of long standing of the Post Office employees. He\r\nsaid: \"As regarded what had been said about undue influence, his\r\ncontention was that so long as the Postal officials, or should he say\r\nthe members of the Civil Service, and for that matter the members\r\nof the fighting services were allowed to maintain a vote, they had\r\nprecisely the same rights as all other voters in the country to\r\nexercise their fullest influence in the defense of their rights,\r\nprivileges and interests. He might mention that all classes of\r\nall communities, all professions, all trades, all combinations of\r\nindividuals, such as anti-vaccinationists and so forth, had invariably\r\nused their utmost pressure in defense of their interests and views upon\r\nMembers of the House....\"[235]\r\n\r\nSir Albert K. Rollit supported Captain Norton's motion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Chancellor of the Exchequer asks for non-Party Vote_]\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Austen Chamberlain, spoke as\r\nfollows: \"The question at issue was not one between the two political\r\nparties. It was above parties. It was whether there was to be good\r\neconomical government in the country at all, or whether the Civil\r\nServants in the employment of the Crown could make such use of their\r\nvotes, as citizens, for the purely selfish purpose of forcing the\r\npublic to pay more for their services and so increase the expenditure\r\nof a great Department of State. He did not know how long they could\r\ngo on in the position they had now reached, under which pressure\r\nwas brought to bear on Honorable Members of all parties by their\r\nconstituents. He was certain that if any scheme could be devised ...\r\nso that they might take this question altogether out of the region of\r\npolitical life--not merely out of party life, but out of Parliamentary\r\nlife--it would be a great advantage. It would tend to preserve the\r\nCivil Service free from that political influence and independent\r\nof the changing fortunes of party which had been their great boast\r\nand security in the past. If there were a general feeling in the\r\nHouse that an object of that kind was one on which all parties might\r\nwell coöperate, then His Majesty's Government, while maintaining as\r\nresolutely as they had in past years their objection to referring these\r\nspecific grievances to a Select Committee appointed in the ordinary\r\nway for that particular purpose, would be prepared to assent to the\r\nappointment of a Committee of this House to consider the state of\r\naffairs which had arisen; to see if they could devise some remedy for\r\nit; to lay down the principles by which they should be governed in\r\nthese matters; and to advise whether it would be possible to establish\r\nsome permanent body or Commission, outside the sphere of electoral\r\npressure and above and beyond any of our party conflicts, which might\r\nadvise the Government in applying those principles to particular cases.\r\nSuch a Committee could, of course, only be successfully conceded with\r\nthe good will of all parties in the House, and if the whole House were\r\nanimated by a desire, if possible, to set this question at rest. With\r\nthat good-will, he thought, it might serve a useful purpose. The object\r\nto be attained was of such vast importance that he, for one, would not\r\nrefuse any method by which they might hope successfully to compass it\r\nand to maintain the Civil Service in that high position of which, with\r\nits great traditions, they had such just cause to be proud and such\r\ngood reason to be grateful for.\"[236]\r\n\r\nCaptain Norton's motion was lost by a vote of 249 to 205. The House\r\ndivided on party lines, only two Members of the Opposition voting with\r\nthe Government, and only nine supporters of the Government voting\r\nwith the Opposition.[237] Of the Members of the Opposition who voted\r\nin support of Captain Norton's motion, two shortly afterward became\r\nmembers of the Cabinet in Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman's Liberal\r\nMinistry, and fifteen others became members of the Ministry, but not of\r\nthe Cabinet, or inner circle.[238]\r\n\r\nCaptain Norton himself became one of the four Junior Lords of the\r\nTreasury. The latter functionaries \"are expected to gather the greatest\r\nnumber of their own party into every division [of the House of\r\nCommons], and by persuasion, promises, explanation, and every available\r\nexpedient, to bring their men from all quarters to the aid of the\r\nGovernment upon any emergency. It is also their business to conciliate\r\nthe discontented and doubtful among the ministerial supporters, and to\r\nkeep every one, as far as possible, in good humor.\"[239]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn _The Nineteenth Century and After_, for April, 1906, Mr. J.\r\nH. Heaton, in an article entitled: _Wanted! An End to Political\r\nPatronage_, discussed at length some of the after effects of the\r\nmemorable debate of July 6, 1905. Mr. Heaton had been returned to\r\nParliament from Canterbury in 1885, 1886, 1892, 1895, and 1900; the\r\nlast four occasions as an unopposed candidate. He had carried the\r\nImperial Penny Postage Scheme in 1888; he had introduced telegraph\r\nmoney orders in England; the parcel post to France, etc.; and the\r\nfreedom of the City of London in a gold casket had been conferred on\r\nhim in 1899.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A Prime Minister on the Civil Service_]\r\n\r\nMr. Heaton opened his article with the statement: \"Many years ago a\r\ngreat Prime Minister wrote to me as follows: 'There can be no doubt\r\nthat the organized attempts of servants of the State to use their\r\npolitical influence at the cost of the taxpayer is likely to become\r\na serious danger. I agree with you in thinking that it can only be\r\neffectually met by agreement between the two sides of the House.'\"\r\nMr. Heaton continued: \"The Civil Servants of the Crown are, taken as\r\na whole, an admirable and efficient body of workers, of whom England\r\nis justifiably proud, and whom--as was held, I think, by the late\r\nMr. Gladstone--she rewards on a generous scale.... It is the more\r\nto be regretted that large classes of them should have fallen into\r\nthe hands of agitators, who incite to the systematic intimidation of\r\nMembers of Parliament with a view to the extortion of larger and larger\r\nvotes [appropriations] for salaries. This evil is rapidly becoming\r\nformidable.... Any official raising the cry of 'higher wages' is sure\r\nof popularity among his fellows, who instantly regard him as a born\r\nleader. The pleasant prospect of an increase of income without working\r\nfor it is a bait that never fails to appeal most strongly to the least\r\nenergetic and deserving. A postman or dockyard hand finds that he can\r\nwin promotion and increased pay only by strenuous hard work, just as if\r\nhe were a mere artisan or shop assistant. But the agitators point out\r\nthat he can attain an equivalent result by bullying the local M. P.,\r\nand so he joins the league or union formed for the purpose.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Sir William Harcourt on Post Office Employees_]\r\n\r\n\"Where is this to stop? The late Sir W. Harcourt[240] wrote (to me)\r\nthat the demands of the Postal employees reached a depth, or abyss,\r\nwhich no plummet would fathom. We know now that they claim the Postal\r\nsurplus, which amounts to nearly five millions [sterling].... There\r\nare 192,000 of them, and of these probably 100,000 have votes. Adding\r\nthese to the dockyard, arsenal, and stores factory hands, and other\r\nGovernment employees, we have a political force that may turn the\r\nscale at a General Election. Candidates are tempted to bid against one\r\nanother with the taxpayer's money. 'Let us be charitable!' said Sydney\r\nSmith, and put his hand into a bystander's pocket. Our legislators were\r\nproof against the hectoring of the Tudors, the violence of the Stuarts,\r\nand the blandishments of the Georges; surely they will never yield to\r\nthe menaces of demagogues.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Thirty M. P.'s threatened with Loss of Seat_]\r\n\r\n\"At this point I would like to state briefly my own experience....\r\nLast year great pressure was brought to bear in the House of Commons\r\non Members of Parliament, and, with thirty other Members, I was\r\nthreatened with the loss of my seat unless I voted to meet the demands\r\nof the Postal servants. It was further intimated to me that the\r\nPostal servants' vote, 100,000 strong, would turn out any Government.\r\nA few minutes afterwards it fell to my lot to address the House on\r\nthe question of increase of postmen's wages.... I ended my speech by\r\ndeclaring that civil servants who threatened Members of Parliament for\r\nrefusing to vote them increased salaries ought to be disfranchised.\r\nResult--a meeting called in my constituency, my opponent placed in\r\nthe chair, and a vote of censure passed on me. The London postmen\r\ncame to Canterbury and addressed my constituents at the meeting. It\r\nis not surprising, therefore, that at the recent election my agents\r\ninformed me that 46 postmen voted solid against me.[241] I do not\r\nblame the postmen; they were perfectly justified in using their power;\r\nbut if I had not had at my back one of the most intelligent bodies of\r\nelectors in the United Kingdom, I should have been defeated through the\r\npostmen's action.\r\n\r\n\"It was some consolation to me to receive in the House of Commons,\r\nafter my speech, hearty, though private, congratulations from\r\nhard-working, earnest workingmen representatives, who expressed their\r\nentire approval of what they were pleased to call my courage. But\r\nsomething ought to be done to prevent a recurrence of such a scandal.\"\r\n\r\nIn view of Mr. Heaton's closing remarks, it is interesting to note\r\nthat four of the eight[242] Labor Members voted, and that all of them\r\nfavored the appointment of a House of Commons Select Committee.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Post Office Employees and the General Election of 1906_]\r\n\r\nIn the campaign preceding the General Election of January, 1906,\r\nthe several associations of Postal and Telegraph employees addressed\r\nletters to the candidates for Parliament, asking those candidates\r\nwhether they would \"support the claims of the Postal and Telegraph\r\nemployees and vote for the appointment of a Select Committee of the\r\nHouse of Commons for the purpose of inquiring into their conditions of\r\npay and service; and stating that on their part the workers pledged\r\nthemselves to accept as final the decision of such a tribunal.\" At the\r\nannual conference of the Postal Telegraph Clerks' Association, held in\r\nMarch, 1906, the President of the Association said that nearly 450 of\r\nthe 670 Members of the House of Commons[243] had pledged themselves to\r\nsupport a motion for a Parliamentary Inquiry into the position of the\r\nPost Office employees.[244]\r\n\r\nIn the third sitting of the new Parliament, held on February 20, the\r\nPostmaster General, Mr. Sydney Buxton, announced that the Government\r\nhad decided to appoint a Select Committee of the House of Commons.[245]\r\nAnd on March 6, the Postmaster General introduced a motion for a\r\nCommittee of seven to be nominated by the Committee of Selection.\r\nIn response to the wishes of the House, the Postmaster General\r\nsubsequently changed his motion to one calling for a Committee of nine,\r\nto be appointed by the whips of the several parties in the House.[246]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Prime Minister on Election Pledges_]\r\n\r\nThe motion was carried without debate upon the question whether a\r\nCommittee should be appointed. In the course of the debate whether\r\nthe Committee should be appointed by the Committee of Selection, or\r\nby the Party Whips, Lord Balcarres, who had been a Junior Lord of the\r\nTreasury in the Balfour Government, used these words: \"As regards\r\nthose Honorable Gentlemen who had entered Parliament for the first\r\ntime,[247] he thought he was fairly accurate when he said that they\r\nhad given pretty specific pledges upon the matter [of the appointment\r\nof a Select Committee] to those who had sent them to the House.\"\r\nSir A. Acland-Hood, who had been Chief Whip and Patronage Secretary\r\nto the Treasury in the late Balfour Government, said: \"There was a\r\ndebate and a division [upon this question, last year,] and nearly\r\nthe whole of the supporters of the Government voted against the\r\nappointment of the Committee. No doubt many of them suffered for it\r\nat the General Election; they either lost their seats or had their\r\nmajorities reduced in consequence of the vote.\" And, finally, Sir\r\nHenry Campbell-Bannerman, the new Prime Minister, expressed himself as\r\nfollows in the course of an argument in favor of a Committee appointed\r\nby the Committee of Selection rather than by the House itself through\r\nthe agency of the Party Whips. The Prime Minister said: \"There was\r\na great deal of force in what the Right Honorable Gentleman [Sir A.\r\nAcland-Hood] had said as to the fears that were entertained in many\r\nquarters of the effect on the Committee if appointed under pressure and\r\ninsistence, and the retroactive effect of old promises extracted in\r\nmoments of agony from candidates at the General Election.\"[248]\r\n\r\nThe Select Committee on Post Office Servants consists of: 4 Liberals,\r\nMessrs. Barker, Edwards, Hobhouse and Sutherland; 2 Conservatives, the\r\nHonorable Claude Hay and Sir Clement Hill; 2 Liberal and Labor Members,\r\nMessrs. John Ward and G. J. Wardle; and 1 Nationalist, Mr. P. A.\r\nMeechan.[249]\r\n\r\nThe reference to the Committee is: \"to inquire into the wages and\r\nposition of the principal classes of Post Office servants, and also of\r\nthe unestablished postmasters. To examine, so far as may be necessary\r\nfor the purpose of their Report, the conditions of employment of these\r\nclasses. To report, whether, having regard to the conditions and\r\nprospects of their employment, and, as far as may be, to the standard\r\nrate of wages and the position of other classes of workers, the\r\nremuneration they receive is adequate or otherwise.\"\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1907, the Committee reported that it had not had time\r\nto perform its task, and asked for reappointment.

The telegram sent\r\nby Liverpool postal and telegraph employees was typical of the lot. It\r\ncongratulated Lord Stanley upon his retirement to private life, and\r\nassured him that the senders at all times would do all in their power\r\nto make the retirement a permanent one.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[225] _The Times_, September 19, 1904.\r\n\r\n[226] The apparent net profits of the Post Office Department average\r\nabout $18,500,000 a year.

The new practice is the more insidious\r\n     and dangerous one, for it means class bribery. The doctrine\r\n     that entrance upon the State's service means \"something very\r\n     nearly approaching to a freehold provision for life.\" Official\r\n     testimony of various prominent civil servants, especially of\r\n     Mr. (now Lord) Welby, Permanent Secretary to the Treasury\r\n     from 1885 to 1894; and Mr. T. H. Farrer, Permanent Secretary\r\n     to Board of Trade from 1867 to 1886. The costly practice of\r\n     giving pensions no solution of the problem of getting rid of\r\n     unsatisfactory public servants. The difficulty of dismissing\r\n     incompetent persons extends even to probationers. The cost of\r\n     \"reorganizing\" incompetent persons out of the public service.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Personal Bribery replaced by Class Bribery_]\r\n\r\nThe intervention of the House of Commons in the details of the\r\nadministration of the Post Office Department and the other State\r\nDepartments, is by no means confined to the raising of salaries and\r\nwages. It extends to practically every kind of question that arises\r\nout of the conflicts of the interests of the State servants and the\r\ninterests of the public Treasury. The intervention is due to the\r\norganized action of the \"civil service unions;\" and it is exercised\r\nprimarily on behalf of classes of employees, but not exclusively. The\r\nlatter day spirit of the civil service unions is to make the cause\r\nof the individual the cause of the class, and that brings about much\r\nintervention through the House of Commons, by the organized civil\r\nservice, on behalf of individual State servants. The ancient form of\r\nintervention on behalf of the individual who had claims that were\r\nbased on personal influence or family influence, on family ties, or\r\non friendship, has been abolished. In its place has been developed\r\nintervention on behalf of the individual, prompted by the fact that\r\nthe individual in question is a member of a civil service union that\r\nseeks to enforce certain ideals as to the terms and conditions that\r\nshall prevail in the public service. Of the two forms of intervention,\r\nthe latter is the more pernicious and demoralizing, partly because it\r\nis--or will become--more pervasive, partly because it rests on class\r\nbribery and class corruption, as distinguished from the individual\r\nbribery and the individual corruption upon which rested the old form of\r\nintervention. Of those two forms of corruption, the bribery of classes\r\nis the more difficult to eradicate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _State Employment means Life Employment_]\r\n\r\nOne of the most important results of this intervention on behalf of\r\nindividuals has been the establishment of the doctrine that once a\r\nman has landed in the employ of the State, he has \"something very\r\nnearly approaching to a freehold of provision for life,\" to employ the\r\nwords of the Chairman of the Select Committee on the Civil Services\r\nExpenditure, 1873.[250]\r\n\r\nBefore that committee, Sir Wm. H. Stephenson, Chairman of the Inland\r\nRevenue Commissioners, said: \"... if a man was reported to be\r\nhopelessly inefficient, I should dismiss him; but even then you must\r\nact with a great deal of forbearance. For the simple reason that\r\nyou are amenable to many opinions beside your own. You cannot act\r\nabsolutely upon your own judgment without being liable to be compelled\r\nto give your reasons for that judgment; and these reasons, though\r\nperfectly clear in your own mind, may not always be easy to give to\r\nthe satisfaction of another man.... I am afraid we should have a very\r\nbad time of it out of doors if we exercised a little more freedom in\r\ndismissing incompetent clerks and promoting deserving ones; I judge\r\nvery much by what I see; as it is, there is a great disposition, I\r\nthink, to exclaim against anything like an act of tyranny, and the\r\nexercise of such freedom would be called tyranny.... I have no doubt\r\nthat if a public department had the power of absolute dismissal, it\r\nwould have a considerable effect in increasing efficiency; but what\r\nI say is, that you cannot give them that power in the same way that\r\nit is held by a man in private employment. You have too many critics;\r\nyou have the public newspaper press; you have Members of the House of\r\nCommons who are personally interested in these people; and you would be\r\nsurprised, I am sure, if you knew the numerous instances in which, for\r\nthe smallest thing [inflictions of punishment], applications are made,\r\npressing that this man is an excellent man, a good brother, a kind\r\nfather, and all that kind of thing which influences men individually,\r\nbut which cannot [does, but should not] influence the judgment of the\r\nheads of a public office.\" Sir William H. Stephenson was asked: \"Do\r\nyou not think that it might be made a rule in your office, as in the\r\nCustoms, that any interference through a Member of Parliament should\r\nlead to dismissal?\" He replied: \"Yes; but you must prove that a man\r\nknows it. You cannot dismiss a man if some injudicious friend takes up\r\nhis case; and if a man has a friend, it is always an injudicious one\r\nunder these circumstances.\"[251]\r\n\r\nBefore this same committee of 1873, Mr. Stanfeld, M. P., Third Lord\r\nof the Treasury, who, in 1869 to 1871 had been Financial Secretary\r\nto the Treasury, said: ... \"the great difference between the public\r\nestablishment and the private establishment is this: that practically\r\nspeaking, in a public establishment, you have a large proportion\r\nof established clerks who can do no more than a moderate amount of\r\nservice.... Because you have not the faculty which men in private\r\nbusiness have, without any particular fault, of saying to a man: 'On\r\nthe whole, you do not suit me, and I mean to get somebody else.'\r\nWhen you get a clerk on a public establishment, he remains on that\r\nestablishment with very rare exceptions, and you have to make the best\r\nof your bargain; the result naturally is that, with the exception of\r\nmen of ability and energy, you have not so much stimulus for their\r\neffort as you have in private employment, and you have not by any means\r\nthe same power of dealing with them.\" ...[252]\r\n\r\nIn 1888, before the Royal Commission appointed to inquire into the\r\nCivil Establishments, this question of the great difficulty of\r\ngetting rid of incompetent or undesirable men, was threshed out at\r\ngreat length. Sir Charles DuCane, Chairman of the Commissioners of\r\nCustoms, said: \"But it is an invidious thing, I do not mean to say as\r\nregards myself, but invidious rather as regards the [political] head\r\nof a department [the Minister], to come and make complaints against\r\nmen whom one cannot perhaps accuse of any overt act of negligence or\r\ncarelessness, but who are merely rather below the level of ordinary\r\nefficiency.... I think it would be a most desirable thing that we\r\nshould have the power of getting rid of incapable and inefficient men\r\nwho have yet managed to keep themselves out of any positive scrape or\r\noffence, for which they would be charged before a Member of the Board\r\nof Commissioners of Customs.\"[253]\r\n\r\nTo Sir S. A. Blackwood, Secretary to the Post Office since 1880, the\r\nChairman of the Royal Commission put the question: \"Do you think it is\r\na real evil in the public service that there should not be the same\r\npower to remove inefficient men as exists outside the public service,\r\nof course I mean within certain limits, because the public service must\r\nbe different from private service, but in your experience, have you\r\nfound it to be a real evil in the way of efficiency as well as of wise\r\neconomy to be obliged to keep men whom you would be glad to get rid of\r\nif you could have sent them away with something in their pocket, [_i.\r\ne._, a pension]?\" The answer was: \"Yes, it is a serious objection.\" Sir\r\nS. A. Blackwood even asserted that the Act of 1887, giving the Treasury\r\ndiscretionary power to pension men unable to discharge efficiently the\r\nduties of their office,[254] would not help much. \"We should always\r\nbe asking an officer to relinquish his full pay, and to retire upon\r\na lesser pension than he would be entitled to if he served his full\r\ntime, and there is always a disinclination on the part of heads of\r\ndepartments to do that.\"[255]\r\n\r\nSir Reginald E. Welby, who had entered the Treasury service in\r\n1856, and had been made Permanent Secretary in 1885, said there was\r\nfull power to dismiss idle or incompetent persons without granting\r\npensions or allowances of any sort. Thereupon, Mr. F. Mitford, one of\r\nthe Members of the Royal Commission, asked: \"Is not really the sole\r\ndifficulty that public departments have to contend with in exercising\r\nthat full power, the fact that Parliament is behind them, and a\r\nMember of Parliament always asks questions [in the House] and brings\r\ninterest [pressure] to bear upon the head of the department, which\r\npractically annuls that power? The difficulty lies not with the public\r\nofficer, but practically with the difficulties that are thrown in his\r\nway outside his department by individual Members of Parliament?\" The\r\nPermanent Secretary of the Treasury answered: \"There is always before\r\nthe heads of departments the fact that pressure may be brought to bear\r\nby Members of Parliament, and it requires, therefore, that a case must\r\nbe very strong, that it must be a very good case before you would\r\ndismiss. Probably you would be much more long-suffering in a Government\r\ndepartment, than you would be in a private establishment.\" Sir Reginald\r\nWelby just previously had said: \"I have known men dismissed from the\r\nTreasury.... Perhaps I had better say, I have heard of men being\r\ndismissed from the Treasury for simple idleness, but it was before my\r\ntime.\" Thereupon the Chairman had queried: \"It is the fact, speaking\r\ngenerally, is it not, that mere idleness and mere incompetence, without\r\nvery gross negligence of duty or gross misbehavior, does not bring\r\nabout dismissal from the service, either in the Treasury or anywhere\r\nelse that you are aware of?\" The reply was: \"I would rather put it in\r\nthis way: I think that Government offices are very long-suffering in\r\nthat matter. If the man was reported as distinctly very idle and not\r\ndoing his work he would be warned, and I think if it was repeated after\r\nthat (I am speaking of any fairly managed Government department), he\r\nwould be dismissed. But I think that a Government department is, for\r\none reason or another, more long-suffering than a private establishment\r\nwould be.... While I am admitting the possibility of there being\r\nbad officers, I should like to add that both in the Upper and Lower\r\nDivision Clerks, we have got, on the whole, a very satisfactory set of\r\nmen under the present regulations of the Treasury, and that they do\r\ntheir work well. I am happy to say that very few cases of complaint\r\ncome before me.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The House of Commons is Master_]\r\n\r\nMr. Lawson, a member of the Royal Commission, asked Sir Reginald Welby:\r\n\"But you would hardly plead the interference of Members of Parliament\r\nas a justification for not getting rid of an unworthy servant,\r\nwould you?\" Sir Reginald Welby replied: \"It is not a good reason,\r\nbut as a matter of fact it is powerful. The House of Commons are our\r\nmasters.\"[256]\r\n\r\nSir T. H. Farrer, who had been Permanent Secretary of the Board of\r\nTrade from 1867 to 1886, and had been a Member of the so-called\r\nPlayfair Commission, of 1876, on the Civil Service, was asked by Mr.\r\nR. W. Hanbury, a Member of the Royal Commission of 1888, whether the\r\nfailure to dismiss incompetent men could not be attributed to \"soft\r\nheartedness\" on the part of heads of departments? Sir T. H. Farrer\r\nreplied: \"Yes, that is another aspect of the case, and it is no doubt\r\ntheoretically perfectly true; but I think it overlooks what is the real\r\ndifficulty of getting rid of useless men. There is a certain difficulty\r\nin the soft heartedness of heads of departments and of Ministers.\r\nBut there is a very much greater difficulty in the pressure which is\r\nput upon them by Members of the House of Commons. That is the real\r\ndifficulty; the real difficulty of the public service is getting rid of\r\nbad men; and the real difficulty of getting rid of bad men is that no\r\nMinister will face the pressure which is put upon him from outside....\r\nI have had much personal experience of the matter; I have been\r\nplagued all my life at the Board of Trade with inefficient men that I\r\nwanted to get rid of, but have been unable to do so.... Parliamentary\r\npressure is the main difficulty.... Members are economical in general\r\n[protestations]; but in particular cases they think more of their\r\nconstituents than of the public service. No doubt with a little\r\nthinking I could recall a very great number of instances, but two or\r\nthree occur to me.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _You may dismiss but you must not_]\r\n\r\n\"Not very many years ago there was a clerk of whom perpetual complaints\r\nwere made to me. He was in a hard-worked department, and the heads of\r\nit told me repeatedly: 'We can do nothing with him.' At last we got it\r\narranged that he should go [with a large pension, on the theory that\r\nhis office was abolished, because no longer required]. My back was\r\nturned--I was away on a holiday--and when I came back, I found that\r\nParliamentary pressure, by which I mean applications from Members, had\r\nbeen put on, and in spite of us all, the man was back in the place to\r\nthe detriment of our credit. Let me mention another case. I was engaged\r\nupon a reorganization of the department under one of the strongest\r\nmen [Ministers] I have ever served. What the President of the Board\r\nof Trade said to me, in effect was: 'We must have new blood; we are\r\ngetting crowded up with effete men; I will back you in anything you\r\ndo, only you must undertake not to get me into a difficulty in the\r\nHouse of Commons. I cannot afford it; the Government cannot afford time\r\nfor it; they cannot afford strength to fight battles of that kind.'\r\nWe set to work about the reorganization with our hands tied, and we\r\nwere obliged to say to these men: 'Well, if you stay here, we will\r\nmake it very uncomfortable for you; we will put you in the very worst\r\nplaces in the office,' The Treasury offered good terms of retirement\r\n[pensions], and in that way, after a good deal of fighting, we got\r\nrid of most of them.... We had to give them very high terms [that is,\r\nvery liberal pensions]. I may mention a case which happened even since\r\nthen. I refer to the official Receivers in Bankruptcy. They were men\r\nwho were appointed only a few years ago, under the most stringent\r\nconditions imposed by the Treasury and the Board of Trade, and without\r\nthe slightest reference to personal considerations or to politics. They\r\nwere told that they were appointed on trial, that they might be removed\r\nat any moment if the Board of Trade desired it for the good of the\r\nservice. Fortunately, most of them have turned out extremely well. One,\r\nperhaps more, turned out bad, but one certainly turned out very bad.\r\nPerpetual complaints were made to me by the head of that department\r\nthat he could do nothing with this man, and that the business was\r\nbeing badly conducted. After a good deal of trouble, after I left, it\r\nwas determined to remove this man. The Members of Parliament for the\r\ncounty, as I am told, came and put pressure upon the President of the\r\nBoard of Trade [the Minister], till he was obliged to say: 'I cannot\r\nremove him; he must stay.'\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Pension System no Remedy_]\r\n\r\nTo the foregoing testimony from the Permanent Secretary of the Board of\r\nTrade, the Chairman of the Royal Commission replied: \"I gather from\r\nwhat you say, that, supposing it was possible, under this new system\r\nof pensions and allowances, to give a man who was sent away from the\r\nservice the money which he had himself contributed toward his ultimate\r\npension, either with or without the addition of a Government grant,\r\nyou do not think that would get over the difficulty in getting rid of\r\nincompetent men?\" Sir T. H. Farrer replied: \"No, I do not think it\r\nwould, unless the House of Commons passes a self-denying ordinance,\r\nand refuses to interfere with the Ministers in the management of their\r\ndepartments.\"[257]\r\n\r\nLater in the examination, Lord Lingen, who had been Permanent Secretary\r\nof the Treasury from 1869 to 1885, said to Sir T. H. Farrer: \"You have\r\ngiven a good deal of evidence as to the difficulties which the relation\r\nof the public departments to Parliament creates. I think we might hold\r\nthere is nothing in private service analogous to what you may call the\r\ntriennial change of Government, that [when] everybody who has been\r\npassed over [not promoted], who thinks he has any grievance, considers\r\nthat he has a fresh chance on a change of Ministry?\" The Secretary of\r\nthe Board of Trade replied: \"Yes, I remember distinctly one particular\r\ncase in which on every change of Government a fresh appeal was made\r\nto the new Ministers on behalf of men who had been retired for good\r\nreasons.\" Lord Lingen continued: \"It revived questions which had been\r\nsupposed to be settled?\" \"Yes, it does, not infrequently.\"\r\n\r\nOn August 1, 1890, in the House of Commons, the Postmaster General, Mr.\r\nRaikes, in speaking of a Post Office employee who had been disciplined,\r\nsaid: \"The case is one to which I have given a great deal of personal\r\nattention; indeed, I may say that in cases of dismissal or punishment\r\nI have always endeavored to satisfy myself thoroughly as to the facts,\r\nand to mitigate, if I can, the effect of the regulations of the\r\nDepartment.\" On that same day the Postmaster General stated--in reply\r\nto Mr. Conybeare,[258] who was intervening on behalf of one Cornwell,\r\ndismissed from the postal service--that Cornwell had been dismissed\r\nfor the second time. After the first dismissal, the Postmaster General\r\nhimself had reinstated Cornwell. The second dismissal had been\r\nnecessary \"in the interest of the Service at large, but especially in\r\nthat of the other men employed on the same duty, his case should be\r\ndealt with in an exemplary manner.\"[259]\r\n\r\nIn March, 1896, the Chairman of the Inter-Departmental Committee on\r\nPost Office Establishments, asked Mr. Lewin Hill, Assistant Secretary\r\nGeneral Post Office: \"Do you think there is any other particular\r\nclass of employment which is comparable with that of the postmen?\"\r\nMr. Hill replied: \"I thought of railway servants, whose work in many\r\nways resembles the work of our employees. If they have not the same\r\npermanence as our people have, they have continuous employment so\r\nlong as they are efficient, but our people have continuous employment\r\nwhether they are efficient or not.\"[260] Several months later, Mr.\r\nHill testified as follows before this same Committee: \"Our inquiries\r\nhave proved that the telegraph staff at Liverpool is excessive, and\r\nit has been decided, on vacancies [occurring], to abolish the ten\r\nappointments.\"[261] The meaning of this statement is, that if a mistake\r\nis made, and too many men are appointed to a certain office; or, if\r\nthe business of an office falls off, the Government cannot correct\r\nthe redundancy of employees by dismissing, or by transferring to some\r\nother office, the redundant employees. It must wait until promotion,\r\nretirement on account of old age, or death shall remove the redundant\r\nemployees. Before this same committee, Mr. J. C. Badcock, Controller\r\nLondon Postal Service, testified that in theory there were no first\r\nclass letter sorters in the foreign newspaper department of the London\r\nPost Office, since there had been, since 1886, no work that called for\r\nfirst class newspaper sorters.\r\n\r\nBut as a matter of fact there were thirty-seven \"redundant first class\r\nsorters, who, upon resignation, or pensioning, or death, would be\r\nreplaced by second class sorters.\"[262]\r\n\r\nIn 1902, Sir Edgar Vincent,[263] a Member of the Select Committee on\r\nNational Expenditure, 1902, asked Lord Welby, who had been Permanent\r\nSecretary to the Treasury from 1885 to 1894: \"It is, I presume,\r\nextremely difficult for the Minister at the head of a Department to\r\ndismiss, or place on the retired list incompetent officers?\" Lord Welby\r\nreplied: \"It is very difficult. Of course there are different degrees\r\nof incompetency. It is not so difficult in the case of a notoriously\r\nincompetent officer, but there are many people, as the honorable Member\r\nis aware, against whom nothing whatever can be said, who are still\r\nthe very reverse of competent.\" Sir Edgar Vincent continued: \"Can you\r\nsuggest any means of substituting for a Minister whom it is almost\r\nimpossible to expect to perform the duty, some authority who should\r\nrevise Establishments and exclude the bad bargains?\" Lord Welby, of\r\ncourse, replied that the remedy suggested would be inconsistent with\r\nthe principles of parliamentary government,[264] in that it would\r\nsubstitute for the Minister, who holds office at the pleasure of the\r\nHouse of Commons, some permanent officer or officers appointed by the\r\nMinistry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Difficult to dismiss Probationers_]\r\n\r\nOftentimes the difficulty experienced in dismissing unsatisfactory\r\npublic servants, extends even to persons appointed on probation.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1875, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in the course of the\r\nFinancial Statement, said: \"We now appoint young men upon probation,\r\nand the understanding of that probationary employment is that if the\r\nperson is found after six months or a year to be unfit, he is told that\r\nhe must look elsewhere. This is a very invidious duty for the head of\r\nan office to perform, and it is very often not performed.\"[265]\r\n\r\nIn 1888, Mr. Harvey, a Member of the Royal Commission on the Civil\r\nEstablishments, said: \"The tendency in a Government office is for\r\nthe man to regard his probationary period as practically a '_nominis\r\numbra_' [the mere shadow of a name], nothing else.\"[266]\r\n\r\nThe Chairman of the Royal Commission of 1888 asked Sir Reginald Welby,\r\nthe Permanent Secretary to the Treasury: \"Is there anything like a real\r\nprobation in any one of the divisions of the clerks at the Treasury, so\r\nthat you can find out [whether they are likely to prove competent]?\"\r\n\"Yes, I think so. The principal clerk of the division to which the\r\nprobationer is attached makes a report at the end of six months; and I\r\nhave known a principal clerk to make a doubtful report. In that case,\r\nif I remember rightly, the term of probation was extended.\"[267]\r\n\r\nThe boys employed by the Post Office Department for the delivery of\r\ntelegrams, are, in a way, on continuous probation. If they serve\r\nsatisfactorily, they are, at the age of 16, taken in training for the\r\nposition of postmen. In 1897, Mr. Lewin Hill, Assistant Secretary\r\nGeneral Post Office, said: ... \"in London, in the past, the weeding out\r\nof messenger boys at 16 years has not been carried out so far, I think,\r\nowing to the paternal feelings of the Department. Every effort seems to\r\nhave been made to keep in the service anybody who could possibly scrape\r\nthrough. But the country postmasters were, as a rule, careful to weed\r\nout unsatisfactory lads.\" He continued: ... \"We could have got better\r\npostmen [in London], if we had had a free hand.\"[268]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1857 the opposition made in Parliament to the system of pensions,\r\nled to the appointment of a Committee to inquire into the operation\r\nof the Superannuation Act, 1834. That Committee stated as follows the\r\nargument \"from the public point of view\" in favor of pensions. \"Though\r\nit is strictly the duty of heads of departments to remove from the\r\npublic service all those who have become unfit to discharge their\r\nduties, yet experience shows that this duty cannot be enforced. It is\r\nfelt to be hard--and even unjust--and inefficient men are, therefore,\r\nretained in the Service to the detriment of efficiency. They,\r\ntherefore, were unhesitatingly of opinion that the public interest\r\nwould be best consulted by maintaining a system of superannuation\r\nallowances.\"[269]\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the foregoing recommendation Parliament, in 1859,\r\nenacted that the Treasury might give \"abolition terms\" to persons whose\r\noffices should be abolished in consequence of the \"reorganization\" of\r\ntheir department, or branch of service. Under that Act, inefficient\r\npersons who are \"reorganized out of the service\" are given \"pro rata\"\r\npensions, plus an allowance for \"abolition of their office.\" For\r\nexample, a man aged 50, with 30 years of service, who would become\r\nentitled to a pension at the age of 60, will be retired at 50 years,\r\nwith a pro rata pension on the basis of 30 years' service, plus an\r\nallowance of 7 or 10 years' service for abolition of his office.[270]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Cost of Pensions to the Incompetent_]\r\n\r\nIn 1873, before the Select Committee on Civil Services Expenditure,\r\nSir William H. Stephenson, Chairman of the Commissioners of Inland\r\nRevenue, illustrated the working of this system with the statement\r\nthat in 1873-74, the salaries paid in the Inland Revenue Department\r\nwould aggregate $4,808,580. An additional $683,160 would be required\r\nfor pensions; and a further $234,175 would be required on account of\r\nthe abolition terms given to men who had been reorganized out of the\r\nInland Revenue Department. Thus the \"non-effective,\" or non-revenue\r\nproducing, charges of the department were equivalent to 19 per cent. of\r\nthe effective, or revenue producing, charges.[271]\r\n\r\nIn 1888 the Royal Commission appointed to inquire into the Civil\r\nEstablishments reported that the burden on the State for pensions was\r\nequivalent to 12 per cent. to 15 per cent. of the working salaries,\r\nand that the payment of the abolition terms raised the percentage in\r\nquestion to 20 per cent. of the working salaries. Sir Reginald E.\r\nWelby, Secretary to the Treasury, stated before the Commission, that\r\neven the past liberal expenditure on account of pro rata pensions with\r\nabolition terms, had not enabled the State to get rid of \"inefficient\r\nand incapable men.\" The Chairman of the Royal Commission spoke of the\r\nabolition terms as amounting \"almost to a scandal.\" Sir R. E. Welby and\r\nLord Lingen, a former Secretary to the Treasury, contrasted the State's\r\nsystem of pensions with the system of the London and North Western\r\nRailway. The Railway's pension system was maintained out of a fund\r\nraised by a 2.5 per cent. reduction from the salaries of the employees,\r\nand a 2.5 per cent. contribution from the treasury of the railway.\r\n\r\nSir R. E. Welby, Secretary to the Treasury, and other witnesses, spoke\r\nof the abolition terms often acting as a premium on inefficiency.\r\nMr. Robert Giffen, the eminent statistician and political economist,\r\nwho also was an officer of the Board of Trade, said: \"When a man is\r\nreorganized out of the service, as a rule he gets so many years'\r\nservice added [to his actual service], that is to say, at 50 years, if\r\nhe has served 30 years, he may have 7 or 10 years' service added, and\r\nthus get two-thirds of his salary as a pension; and he begins to get\r\nhis pension at once, instead of waiting until he is 60 years of age. A\r\nman who thus gets a pension at 50 years, really gets more than double\r\nwhat he would get if he waited until 60 years of age. The present value\r\nof $100 a year, beginning at once at the age of 50 years, is a good\r\ndeal more than double the present value of $100 a year to be paid to a\r\nman when he reaches 60 years. The difference in favor of the man who is\r\nreorganized out of the service, as against the man who remains until he\r\nis 60 years of age, is simply overwhelming to my mind.\"\r\n\r\nSir Algernon E. West, Chairman of the Inland Revenue Commissioners,\r\nillustrated the working of the practice of getting rid of inefficient\r\nmen by reorganizing an office, by citing the following instance of\r\n\"successful\" reorganization. Sir Algernon West had retired 39 upper\r\ndivision clerks, permanently reducing the number of the staff by 39.\r\nHe had thus effected a saving in salaries of $70,000 a year. But he\r\nhad incurred an annual expenditure of $44,160 on account of pensions,\r\nand an annual expenditure of $10,000 on account of abolition terms.\r\nTherefore his net saving was not $70,000 but only $15,840. Yet Sir\r\nAlgernon West denominated his reorganization successful.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this reorganization, Sir Algernon West had increased\r\nthe hours of work from 6 hours to 7 hours. The reorganization, also,\r\nhad necessitated certain promotions. Sir Algernon had made it a\r\ncondition of promotion, that the man promoted should consent to work\r\n7 hours a day. Men not promoted he gave $150 a year \"as a personal\r\nallowance in consideration of the extra hour they were called to\r\nserve.\" One man, aged 34 years, declined to work more than 6 hours on\r\nany terms, saying that the Government had made a contract with him for\r\nsix hours' work a day. In order to get rid of this man, Sir Algernon\r\nWest gave him a pension on the basis of 10 years' service. Legally,\r\nof course, the man had no claim to any pension or abolition allowance\r\nwhatever, for he was in reality dismissed for refusing to perform the\r\nduties demanded of him.[272]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[250] _Third Report from the Select Committee on Civil Services\r\nExpenditure_, 1873; q. 4,283 to 4,288.\r\n\r\n[251] _Third Report from the Select Committee on Civil Services\r\nExpenditure_, 1873; q. 4,270 to 4,282, 4,146 and following, and 4,198\r\nto 4,210.\r\n\r\n[252] _Third Report from the Select Committee on Civil Services\r\nExpenditure_, 1873; q. 4,937.\r\n\r\n[253] _Second Report of the Royal Commission appointed to inquire into\r\nthe Civil Establishments_, 1888; q. 17,559, 17,572, and 17,564.\r\n\r\n[254] The Act of 1887 reads: \"Where a civil servant is removed from\r\noffice on the ground of his inability to discharge efficiently the\r\nduties of his office, and a superannuation allowance cannot lawfully\r\nbe granted to him under the Superannuation Acts of 1834 and 1859, and\r\nthe Treasury thinks that the special circumstances of the case justify\r\nthe grant to him of a retiring allowance, they may grant to him such\r\nretiring allowance as they think just and proper.\" ...\r\n\r\n[255] _Second Report of the Royal Commission appointed to inquire into\r\nthe Civil Establishments_, 1888; q. 17,774 to 17,776, and 17,942a.\r\n\r\n[256] _Second Report of the Royal Commission appointed to inquire into\r\nthe Civil Establishments_, 1888; q. 10,532 to 10,544.\r\n\r\n[257] _Second Report of the Royal Commission appointed to inquire into\r\nthe Civil Establishments_, 1888; q. 19,980, 20,011 to 20,020, and\r\n20,082.\r\n\r\n[258] _Who's Who_, 1905, Conybeare, C.

Testimony presented before:\r\n     Select Committee on Civil Services Expenditure, 1873; Select\r\n     Committee on Post Office, 1876; Royal Commission to inquire\r\n     into the Civil Establishments, 1888; from statement made in\r\n     House of Commons, in 1887, by Mr. Raikes, Postmaster General;\r\n     and before the so-called Tweedmouth Committee, 1897. Instances\r\n     of intervention by Members of House of Commons on behalf of\r\n     civil servants who have not been promoted, or are afraid they\r\n     shall not be promoted.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the matter of promotion, also, the civil servants' unions compel the\r\nMembers of Parliament to intervene, on behalf of individual employees,\r\nin the details of the administration of the several Departments of\r\nState. The organized civil service is not content that every man should\r\nhave an equal chance of promotion, so far as his industry and capacity\r\nshall qualify him for advancement; it evinces a marked tendency to\r\ndemand equal promotion in fact, that is, the elimination of the effects\r\nof the natural inequality among men. The House of Commons, in yielding\r\nin this matter to the pressure from the organized civil service, is\r\ntending to reduce the public service to a dull level of mediocrity,\r\nwhich action at one and the same time impairs the efficiency of the\r\npublic service and makes the service of the State unattractive to able\r\nand ambitious men.\r\n\r\nIn this matter of promotion, the permanent heads of the Departments\r\nare hampered also by the unbusinesslike attitude toward the conduct of\r\nthe public business that characterizes large sections of the newspaper\r\npress as well the great mass of the voters. That unbusinesslike frame\r\nof mind, in turn, is the outgrowth of that untrained sympathy which\r\nmakes every one tend to sympathize with the individual, whenever\r\nthe interest of the individual clashes with that of the State. To\r\nillustrate, in 1873, before the Select Committee on Civil Services\r\nExpenditure, Sir William H. Stephenson, Chairman of the Commissioners\r\nof Inland Revenue, stated that in his Department promotion was mainly\r\nby seniority in the two lowest classes, to some extent by seniority in\r\nthe third class, but beyond that entirely by merit. But he hastened to\r\nadd: \"Indeed, if I may judge by the complaints that I have heard out of\r\ndoors, occasionally in the newspaper press, and elsewhere, the system\r\nof promotion by merit is supposed to be carried to rather an excessive\r\nextent in the Inland Revenue.\"[273]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Glasgow Postmaster's \"Mistake\"_]\r\n\r\nIn 1876, before the Select Committee on Post Office, Mr. Hobson,\r\nPostmaster at Glasgow, stated that he could not promote his telegraph\r\noperators according to their dexterity, he was obliged to promote\r\naccording to seniority. Mr. Gower, a member of the Select Committee\r\nqueried: \"Therefore, there is no encouragement whatever to superior\r\ndexterity?\" Mr. Hobson replied: \"I should not recommend a clerk for\r\npromotion ... if I were satisfied that he was not doing all he could\r\nto improve himself ... and was only an indifferent operator. I should\r\nmention that in submitting the report, and recommend him to be passed\r\nover.\" Mr. Gower continued: \"But suppose he took every sort of pains to\r\nimprove himself, but did not improve?\" The answer came: \"I would then\r\nrecommend him to go forward [_i. e._ for promotion].\" Mr. Gower then\r\nasked: \"Have you any power to exchange a clerk who is a slow operator\r\nfor another quicker operator in a district where it would not signify?\"\r\nThe Postmaster at Glasgow replied: \"None whatever.\"[274] The reader\r\nwill recall that there are numerous telegraph stations in Glasgow.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1877, the Postmaster General, Lord John Manners, replied\r\nto the Report of the Select Committee of 1876, in a letter to the\r\nLords Commissioners of the Treasury. He concluded the letter with\r\nthe statement: \"In conclusion, I beg leave to say that it is, I\r\nthink, hardly worth while to attempt to contradict the mistakes as\r\nto promotion into which the postmaster of Glasgow was accidentally\r\nbetrayed in giving his evidence before the Committee of last Session,\r\nand to which no reference is made in their Report.\"[275]\r\n\r\nBefore the same Committee, Mr. Edward Graves, Divisional Engineer,\r\nrecommended that the head of the Post Office establish the rule, \"that,\r\nother things being equal as to seniority and general business capacity,\r\npreference for promotion shall always be given to the telegraph clerk\r\nwho has shown himself possessed of technical knowledge, and who is\r\ndesirous of obtaining technical information.\"[276]\r\n\r\nPassing over a period of 28 years, that is, from the year 1876 to the\r\nyear 1904, we find Mr. E. Trenam, Controller London Central Telegraph\r\nOffice, testifying that because of danger that in the immediate future\r\nthere would be a lack of telegraph clerks who had a knowledge of the\r\ntechnics of telegraphy, Mr. W. H. Preece, Engineer-in-Chief, had caused\r\na special increase in pay--$26 a year--to be offered to men who should\r\nacquire such knowledge. The witness added that \"unfortunately many of\r\nthe men who have [acquired] this knowledge are comparative juniors,\r\nand we are compelled to put them to work which those receiving higher\r\npay are incompetent to perform. It will take some years to adjust the\r\nanomaly ... [that is, before the incompetent men receiving higher pay\r\nshall have been pensioned or shall have died]\".[277]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Promotion by Seniority, not Jobbery, the Public Service's\r\nweak Point_]\r\n\r\nBefore the Royal Commission of 1888, appointed to inquire into the\r\nCivil Establishments, Sir Thomas H. Farrer, who had been a Member of\r\nthe Playfair Royal Commission of 1876, and had been Permanent Secretary\r\nof the Board of Trade from 1867 to 1886, said: \"I should like to say\r\nthat in the discussion which led [in 1872] to the adoption of Mr.\r\nLowe's [Chancellor of the Exchequer] scheme[278] [for the reform of\r\nthe civil service] a mistake was often made, and is still made, in\r\nsupposing that the great evil of the service is jobbery. That is not\r\nthe case, and I say so with great confidence, having regard to what has\r\nbeen done by Ministers whom I have served of both parties. The real\r\nevil of the service is promotion by routine, and not jobbing in the\r\nselection for superior places.[279] But make your regulations what you\r\nwill, the _sine qua non_, to make any regulations work well, is that\r\nthe men at the head of the different offices shall have discretion,\r\nhonesty, and courage, and shall not be afraid to put up the good men\r\nand to keep the inferior men in their place. I am quite confident from\r\nmy own experience that it can be done, but I am certain that it can be\r\ndone only if the men at the head of the offices will take a good deal\r\nof trouble about it.\" Lord Lingen, a Member of the Royal Commission,\r\nand a former Permanent Secretary to the Treasury, interpolated: \"A good\r\ndeal of trouble and a good deal of disagreeable interference.\" Mr.\r\nFarrer continued: \"It requires tact, because of course you must not\r\nput a man up for mere merit. You cannot take a lad of 19 and put him\r\nover a man of 30 without a very strong reason; but taking the different\r\nsub-heads of the department into counsel; by a little give and take; by\r\ncare, discretion, and confidence in the perfect honesty with which the\r\nthing is done, I believe it can be perfectly well managed.... The key\r\nof the whole thing is to put the proper men at the top of the offices.\"\r\n\r\nLord Lingen and Mr. Farrer then went on to state that with every change\r\nof the Government of the day, some civil servants who had been passed\r\nover, or had some other grievance, made the attempt to have their cases\r\nreopened.[280]\r\n\r\nSir Charles DuCane, Chairman of the Commissioners of Customs, said:\r\n\"We promote strictly by merit; we never allow seniority to weigh with\r\nus.\"[281]\r\n\r\nSir Algernon E. West, Chairman of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue,\r\nsaid that he promoted by merit within the limits allowed him by the\r\nTreasury ruling that no clerk could pass out of the second class\r\ninto the first class without 10 years' service in the second class.\r\nSubsequent testimony established the fact that the Treasury had made\r\nthat ruling in order to prevent the second class clerks from bringing\r\npressure on Members of Parliament with the view to securing automatic\r\npromotion from the second class into the first.[282] Just before\r\nmaking the foregoing statement, Sir Algernon West had said: \"If you\r\ntake the whole Civil Service, I think you will find a general concord\r\nof opinion that the man receiving from $2,500 to $3,000 a year is the\r\nweakest part of the Civil Service. I am not speaking of a young man\r\nwho is in process of going higher, but of an elderly man who has risen\r\nto that kind of high salary, and has no prospect of getting anything\r\nmore.... An ordinary middle aged man, who has got to $2,500 or $3,000\r\nor $3,500, generally is far too highly paid.\" Mr. R. W. Hanbury, a\r\nMember of the Royal Commission, queried: \"How would he get such a\r\nposition?\" The answer came: \"By natural progression,\" _i. e._ promotion\r\nby routine.[283]\r\n\r\nSir Lyon Playfair, a man of vast experience in the administration of\r\nthe British Civil Service, said: \"Promotions by merit hardly take place\r\nin most offices, I think; at all events, there are very few instances\r\nbrought before us.\"[284]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Promotion by Seniority the Great Evil_]\r\n\r\nThe Royal Commission itself reported: \"We think that promotion\r\nby seniority is the great evil of the Service, and that it is\r\nindispensable to proceed throughout every branch of it strictly on the\r\nprinciple of promotion by merit, that is to say, by selecting always\r\nthe fittest man, instead of considering claims in order of seniority,\r\nand rejecting only the unfit. It is no doubt true that objections on\r\nthe score of favoritism may arise in the application of such a rule\r\nin public departments, and the intervention of Members of Parliament\r\nalso presents an obvious difficulty, but we think that such constant\r\nvigilance, tact, and resolution as may fairly be expected on the part\r\nof heads of branches and of offices, will meet these objections, and we\r\nbelieve that the certain advantages of promotion by merit to the most\r\ndeserving men, and therefore to the public service, are so great as to\r\nbe sure, in the long run, to command public support.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Able Men must \"wait their Turn\"_]\r\n\r\nShortly before the Royal Commission had made this recommendation,\r\nin words which seemed to place the responsibility for past failure\r\nto promote by merit, on the permanent officers of the Departments,\r\nas distinguished from the political heads of the Departments, the\r\nMinisters, Mr. Raikes, the Postmaster General, and the representative\r\nin the House of Commons of the University of Cambridge, had refused\r\nto accept the advice of the Permanent Secretary of the Post Office,\r\nMr. S. A. Blackwood, in filling a post of some importance in the\r\nSecretary's office. On March 1, 1887, the Postmaster General, Mr.\r\nRaikes, in reply to questions put to him in the House of Commons,\r\nsaid: ... \"It is also the fact that I have recently declined to adopt\r\nthe Secretary's recommendation to promote to the first class [in the\r\nSecretary's office] one of the junior officers in the second class over\r\nthe heads of several clerks of much longer standing. The gentleman whom\r\nI have promoted was, in my judgment, fully qualified for promotion,\r\nand was senior clerk in the class, with the exception of one officer\r\nwho, on the Secretary's recommendation, has been passed over on\r\nsixteen occasions.... What was I asked to do? I was asked to promote\r\na gentleman who was much lower down in the class, a gentleman who was\r\nthird or fourth in the class, and to place him over the heads of his\r\ncolleagues. This I declined to do. I made inquiries in the office, and\r\nI found that the gentleman who was promoted was a meritorious officer\r\nwho had discharged his duties with adequate ability, and therefore\r\nI thought there was no reason for promoting over his head and over\r\nthe heads of one or two other competent officers, a junior officer\r\nwho could well afford to wait his turn. I acted in the interests of\r\nthe Public Service, and especially in the interests of the Department\r\nitself.\"[285]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo Post Office official in the United Kingdom has power to make a\r\npromotion. No one has power to do more than recommend for promotion.\r\nEach recommendation for promotion is examined by the surveyor, and\r\nis then sent to headquarters, where \"a most vigilant check is always\r\nexercised, not from the suspicion that there has been favoritism,\r\nbut in order to secure that favoritism shall not be practised.\"[286]\r\nUltimately the Postmaster General passes upon every recommendation.\r\nSometimes the action of the Postmaster General is merely formal, and is\r\nlimited to the mere affixing of the Postmaster General's signature to\r\nthe recommendation made by the permanent officers of the Department;\r\nat other times it is independent, and is preceded by careful\r\nconsideration of the case by the Postmaster General himself. Whether\r\nor not the Postmaster General shall give his personal attention to a\r\nrecommendation for promotion, is determined largely by the presence or\r\nabsence of the political element, that is, the temper of the House of\r\nCommons. The Postmaster General is not a mere executive officer with\r\na single aim: the efficient administration of his Department. He is\r\nfirst of all an important Minister, that is, one of the aids of the\r\nPrime Minister in keeping intact the party following. He must know\r\nto a nicety how any given administrative act in the Post Office will\r\naffect his party's standing, first in Parliament, and then among the\r\nconstituents of the Members of Parliament. It is true that no British\r\nPostmaster General would convert the Post Office into a political\r\nengine for promoting the interests of his party; but it is equally\r\ntrue that no British Postmaster General would for a moment lose sight\r\nof the fact that Governments have not their being in either a vacuum\r\nor a Utopia, but that they live in a medium constituted of Members of\r\nParliament and the constituents of Members of Parliament.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a protest against the Postmaster General being a Member\r\nof the House of Lords, Sir H. H. Fowler[287] recently said: \"No man who\r\nhas sat in the House of Commons for 10 years can be ignorant of the\r\nfact that there is a tone in the House; that there are occasions in\r\nthe House when, in dealing with votes [of Supply] and administrative\r\nquestions, a Minister is required, who, with his finger on the pulse\r\nof the House, can sweep away the red tape limits and deal with the\r\nquestions at once on broad general public grounds.\" To make the\r\nstatement complete, Sir H. H. Fowler should have added the words: \"and\r\ngrounds of political expediency.\" In the course of his reply to Sir\r\nH. H. Fowler, Mr. R. W. Hanbury, Financial Secretary to the Treasury\r\nand representative in the House of Commons of the Postmaster General,\r\nsaid: \"When I undertook the representation of the Post Office in the\r\nHouse of Commons, the first rule I laid down was that [in replying to\r\nquestions put by Members as to the administrative acts of the Post\r\nOffice] I would take no answer from a permanent official, and that all\r\nanswers [framed in the first instance by permanent officials] should be\r\nseen and approved by the Postmaster General [a Member of the House of\r\nLords]. I also reserved to myself full discretion to alter the answers\r\nif I saw any necessity so to do.\"[288]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Anxieties of Postmasters General_]\r\n\r\nIn 1896, before the Tweedmouth Committee, Mr. H. Joyce, Third\r\nSecretary to General Post Office, London, said: \"I well remember Mr.\r\nFawcett's[289] address to the head of a large Department [of the Post\r\nOffice] who, ... having a large number of promotions to recommend, had\r\ntold the officers concerned whom he had recommended, and whom he had\r\nnot, and what made the matters worse, he had in his recommendations\r\ntaken little account of seniority, whereas Mr. Fawcett, like Mr. Arnold\r\nMorley,[290] had a perfect horror of passing anyone over. I only saw\r\nMr. Fawcett angry on two occasions, and that was one of them.\"[291] A\r\nmoment before giving this testimony, Mr. Joyce had said: \"It is always\r\na matter of deep regret to the Postmaster General--every Postmaster\r\nGeneral under whom I have served--when he is constrained to pass anyone\r\nover. I have seen Mr. Arnold Morley in the greatest distress on such\r\noccasions.\"[292] Again, in defending the action of the Post Office in\r\npromoting one Bocking, a second class sorting clerk at Norwich, over\r\nthe heads of 15 men in his own class, and 8 men in the first class,\r\nto a full clerkship, Mr. Joyce said: \"It is a matter of the greatest\r\nregret to the Postmaster General to feel constrained to pass over so\r\nmany officers, all of whom were thoroughly respectable and zealous, and\r\nperformed the duties on which they were employed very well, but the\r\nlamentable fact remains that they were not fit for a higher position;\r\nevery endeavor was made at headquarters to what I might call squeeze\r\nthem through, but it was no use.\" Mr. Badcock, Controller London Postal\r\nService, corroborated this testimony with the words: \"The statement\r\nis absolutely correct. The reports on which it was based can be\r\nproduced.\"[293] In passing it may be added that in February, 1895, Mr.\r\nR. J. Price, M. P., for Norfolk, East, sought to intervene from the\r\nfloor of the House of Commons in this case of promotion. In 1892 and\r\n1895, Mr. Price had been returned to Parliament from Norfolk, East,\r\nwith majorities of respectively 440 votes and 198 votes.\r\n\r\nStill, again, at the Barry Dock Post Office, a branch office in\r\nCardiff, one Arnold had been promoted from position number 9, by\r\nseniority, among the second class telegraph clerks, to a full\r\nclerkship, skipping class 1 of the telegraphists. Of this action, Mr.\r\nJoyce said: \"It was a matter of great regret to the Postmaster General,\r\nas expressed at the time, to pass so many officers, many of them most\r\ndeserving men, but above Mr. Arnold there was actually no one competent\r\nto fill this important post. Some had a knowledge of postal work,\r\nand some a knowledge of telegraph work, but none [beside Mr. Arnold]\r\nwere conversant with work of both kinds, and some were otherwise\r\nobjectionable. Barry Dock had suddenly shot into existence as a large\r\ntown, which has now a population of about 13,000, and so painful was it\r\nto the Postmaster General to pass over all these deserving officers,\r\nthat, rather than do so, he seriously contemplated raising Barry Dock\r\nto the level of a post town, and giving it a separate establishment of\r\nits own.\"[294] Again, one Robinson was transferred from the Post Office\r\nat Pontefract to a clerkship in the office of Blackpool, being made to\r\npass over the heads of two young men at Blackpool, by name of Eaton\r\nand Butcher. Mr. Joyce said: \"The case was specially put before the\r\nPostmaster General, and with all his horror of passing people over, he\r\ndecided that the two young men Eaton and Butcher were not qualified for\r\npromotion.\"[295]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _\"A Strong Order\"_]\r\n\r\nIn 1885, one Robinson, a postman at Liverpool, and number 210 in his\r\nclass, was jumped to the position of assistant inspector. \"He had,\r\nwhen a young postman, been selected by his inspector as a superior and\r\npromising officer. He had been temporarily employed [by way of tests]\r\nas assistant inspector, and had discharged the duties so efficiently\r\nthat, on a vacancy occurring, he had been promoted to it.\" This case,\r\nas well as those previously mentioned, were cited as \"grievances,\"\r\nbefore the Tweedmouth Committee, by the men selected by the Post\r\nOffice employees to act as their spokesmen before the Committee. Lord\r\nTweedmouth, chairman of the Committee, commenting on the case, said\r\nto Mr. Joyce: \"Still, it seems to have been rather a strong order to\r\nappoint an assistant postman to such an office and to give him such a\r\ngreat promotion.\" Mr. Joyce replied: \"Yes, it certainly does seem so;\r\nbut for the position of inspector or assistant inspector of postmen\r\nthere is no doubt that qualifications are required which are not\r\nordinarily to be found in postmen.... For the positions of inspectors\r\nand assistant inspectors, I think I may say that the local authorities,\r\nand also headquarters, are more particular than they are about any\r\nother promotion, and they are most anxious to select actually the best\r\nman. In almost every other promotion, very great allowance is made for\r\nseniority; but in the case of inspectors it is not so, on account of\r\nthe somewhat rare qualities required of inspectors, and because the\r\npost is a most invidious one.\"[296]\r\n\r\nThe reader will note that in 1896 the Post Office employees were\r\ncomplaining of a promotion made in 1885.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Ablest Man in the Sheffield Office_]\r\n\r\nIt was established before the Tweedmouth Committee that in instances\r\nthe Post Office employees, with the aid of Members of the House\r\nof Commons, have succeeded in forcing the Post Office to revoke\r\npromotions, or to promote men that have been passed over. For example,\r\nMr. Joyce, Third Secretary, General Post Office, said: \"Wykes is\r\nunquestionably a very able man--probably the ablest man in the\r\nSheffield office--and it is quite true that he was promoted [from\r\na second class sortership] to be an assistant superintendent; but\r\nfor reasons quite unconnected with his ability and qualifications,\r\nthat promotion has been cancelled. Having said that, I trust the\r\nCommittee will not press me further upon the point, inasmuch as it\r\nis very undesirable that I should say more.\" Mr. Spencer Walpole, a\r\nMember of the Committee and the Secretary of the Post Office, added:\r\n\"Except, perhaps, that the cancelling of that promotion had nothing\r\nto do with the evidence that has been quoted?\" Mr. Joyce replied: \"It\r\nhad nothing to do with that; the matter is still in a certain sense\r\n_subjudice_.\"[297]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _An M. P. promotes Eleven Men_]\r\n\r\nIn 1887, one M'Dougall, a second class sorter in Liverpool, was\r\nmade a first class sorter, being promoted over the heads of 14 men\r\nwhom the Liverpool postmaster had reported to be \"not qualified for\r\nthe duties of the higher class.\" On March 31, 1887, Mr. Bradlaugh\r\nbrought the matter up in the House of Commons, by means of a question\r\naddressed to the Postmaster General. He was not satisfied with the\r\nanswer that the men passed over had been reported \"not qualified for\r\npromotion.\"[298] Therefore, on June 6, 1887, in Committee of Supply, on\r\nthe Post Office Vote, Mr. Bradlaugh again brought up the case of the 14\r\nLiverpool sorters who had been passed over. He said he had personally\r\ninvestigated the qualifications of the men, and had found \"that none of\r\nthem warranted the answer given by the Postmaster General\" [on March\r\n31].[299] Mr. Bradlaugh also brought up the case of one Hegnett, who\r\nhad been made assistant superintendent over the heads of 19 persons\r\n\"who were his seniors by many years.\" Also the case of one Helsby,\r\npromoted over the heads of 11 persons. Also the case of one Miller,\r\npromoted over one Richardson, \"who had been acting as assistant\r\nsuperintendent for years with the salary of a Supervising Clerk only.\"\r\nMr. Bradlaugh spoke of the Committee of Supply as \"the only tribunal\r\nthat can overrule the Postmaster General.\" On June 17, Mr. Bradlaugh\r\nagain intervened on behalf of the 14 men who had been passed over.\r\n\r\nBefore the Tweedmouth Committee, Mr. F. T. Crosse, a sorting clerk at\r\nBristol, and one of the spokesmen of the Post Office employees, said:\r\n\"Macdougall, Liverpool, a second class sorting clerk, was promoted to\r\nthe first class over the heads of 14 men, his seniors. Mr. Bradlaugh,\r\nM. P., brought the matter up in Parliament during the discussion on the\r\nEstimates. The result of Mr. Bradlaugh's intervention was that 11 of\r\nthe 14 men passed over were promoted in a batch six months later.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Joyce, Third Secretary to General Post Office, London, said it was\r\ntrue that \"very soon afterward,\" 11 of the 14 men were promoted.[300]\r\n\"A great point was stretched\" in favor of 5 of the 11 men. Those 5 men\r\nwere technically called single duty men, and since 1881 no sorting\r\nclerk had been promoted to the first class [at Liverpool] who could not\r\nperform dual duty. Although these five men were single duty men, and\r\ntherefore unable to rotate with others, which was a \"great disability,\"\r\nthey were promoted by reason of Mr. Bradlaugh's intervention.\r\n\r\nIn explanation of the Bradlaugh episode, it should be added, that\r\ndual duty men are those who are able to act as letter sorters as\r\nwell as telegraphists; while single duty men are able to act only as\r\nsorters, or as telegraphists. In order to reap full advantage from the\r\nconsolidation of the telegraph business with the Postal business, the\r\nPost Office for years has been seeking to induce as many as possible\r\nof its employees to make themselves competent to act both as sorters\r\nand as telegraphists. At offices where it would be particularly\r\nadvantageous to have the men able to act both as sorters and as\r\ntelegraphists, the Post Office has sought to establish the rule that\r\nno sorter or telegraphist shall be promoted to the first class, unless\r\nable to act both as sorter and as telegraphist.\r\n\r\nMr. Crosse was not the only witness before the Tweedmouth Committee\r\nwhose testimony illustrated \"the stimulus\" conveyed by questions in\r\nthe House of Commons. Mr. C. J. Ansell, the representative of the\r\nsecond class tracers in London, stated that in 1891 two vacancies\r\namong the first class tracers in a London office had been left open\r\nfor respectively 5 months and 8 months. He added: \"In March, 1894, the\r\nPostmaster General's attention had to be called to this disgraceful\r\nstate of affairs [by the tracers' union]. It required, however, the\r\nstimulus of a question in the House of Commons. We do not know how\r\nfar the Postmaster General is responsible for this state of affairs,\r\nbut it is only fair to state that his attention being drawn to this\r\nmatter by the question, we were successful in getting those promotions\r\nante-dated.\"[301]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe limitations upon the Postmaster General's power to promote men in\r\naccordance with the advice tendered him by his official advisers by no\r\nmeans is confined to the cases of promotion among the rank and file.\r\nFor instance, it was established by the testimony given before the\r\nTweedmouth Committee, that the Postmaster cannot freely promote, to\r\noffices of more importance, postmasters who show that they have more\r\nability than is required to administer the offices over which they\r\nhappen to preside. For if a postmaster proves to be not equal to the\r\ndemands of his office, the Postmaster General cannot always remove\r\nhim to a smaller office, promoting at the same time the more able man\r\nwho happens to be in charge of the smaller office. The Department\r\ntries to meet the situation by sending to the aid of the relatively\r\nincompetent postmaster \"a smart chief clerk,\" taking care, however,\r\nthat the inefficient postmaster shall receive less than the full salary\r\nto which the volume of business of the office would entitle him. If\r\nthat expedient fails, the Department will transfer the postmaster.\r\nMr. Uren, postmaster at Maidstone, and President of the Postmasters'\r\nAssociation, even asserted that nothing short of misconduct would lead\r\nto the transfer of a postmaster.[302] It should be added, however, that\r\nMr. Uren's testimony related to the small and medium sized places only,\r\nnot to the larger cities.[303]\r\n\r\nIt must not be inferred, however, that the postmasters of the small\r\nand medium sized places appeared before the Tweedmouth Committee to\r\ndemand unrestricted promotion by merit. On the contrary, with the great\r\nbulk of the public service of all descriptions,[304] they held that\r\npromotion is \"slow and uncertain\" and that the system of promotion\r\nby merit \"is thoroughly uncertain in its practical working.\" They\r\nprotested also against the uncertainty and inequality inseparable from\r\nthe system of making postmasters' salaries dependent upon the volume\r\nof business done by the several and individual Post Offices. They held\r\nthat no postmaster should be made to suffer by reason of the fact that\r\nhe happened to be stationed in a town or city that was not growing,\r\nor was not growing so rapidly as were other cities. By way of relief\r\nfrom the foregoing \"uncertainties\" and \"inequalities\" they demanded\r\na reorganization of the postal service which should secure to the\r\npostmasters regular annual increments of pay, and should \"regularize\"\r\npromotion.[305]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Rank and File Oppose Promotion by Merit_]\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the Royal Commission appointed to inquire\r\ninto the Civil Establishments, 1888, expressed the belief: \"that the\r\ncertain advantages of promotion by merit to the most deserving men,\r\nand therefore to the public service, are so great as to be sure, in\r\nthe long run, to command public support.\" But the fact remains that a\r\nlarge part of the rank and file of the British civil service is growing\r\nmore and more intolerant of promotion by merit, and demands promotion\r\nby seniority. It will not accept as a fact the natural inequality of\r\nmen; it asserts, with its cousins at the Antipodes, the Australasian\r\ncivil servants, that it is the opportunity that makes the man, not the\r\nman that makes the opportunity. This impatience of the rank and file of\r\nthe civil servants of promotion by merit was brought out in striking\r\nmanner by many of the \"grievances\" cited by the men who appeared before\r\nthe Tweedmouth Committee as the accredited representatives of the Post\r\nOffice employees. Some of those allegations of grievance have just been\r\nrecorded, but this matter is of sufficient importance to warrant the\r\nrecording of still others.\r\n\r\nMr. Joseph Shephard, Chairman of the Metropolitan Districts Board\r\nof the Postal Telegraph Clerks' Association, complained before the\r\nTweedmouth Committee that one West, who had entered the telegraph\r\nservice as a learner in 1881, one month after one Ward had entered as\r\na learner, in 1896 was receiving $640, whereas Ward was receiving\r\nonly $550. It was true that Ward had \"had the misfortune to fail in\r\nthe needle examination,\" the first time he had tried to qualify as a\r\ntelegraphist, but \"that little failure\" ought not to have made the\r\ndifference which existed in 1896. Mr. Shephard also complained that one\r\nMorgan, after 14 years and 11 months of service, was receiving only\r\n$550, whereas one Kensington, after 14 years and 5 months of service,\r\nwas receiving $670. He brushed aside as of no consequence, the fact\r\nthat Kensington had \"qualified\" in four months, whereas Ward had taken\r\ntwelve months to \"qualify.\"[306]\r\n\r\nOne Richardson, a telegraphist, at his own request had been transferred\r\nfrom Horsham to East Grinstead, and thence to Redhill, because of the\r\nsmall chances of vacancies at the first two places. But the staff at\r\nRedhill was weak and therefore the Post Office could not follow its\r\nusual practice of promoting a man, \"not because he is a good man, but\r\nbecause he is not a bad one,\" to use the words of Mr. J. C. Badcock,\r\nController London Postal Service.[307] The authorities had to promote\r\nthe best man at Redhill, and thus Richardson was passed over. Mr. James\r\nGreen, who appeared as the representative of the Postal Telegraph\r\nClerks' Association, referred to Richardson's case as \"the case of a\r\nlearner who with some 5 years' service is, according to my information,\r\nsent here and there relieving, presumably as a sort of recompense,\r\nthough what his future will be remains a mystery. What surprises me\r\nin this matter is the spirit of indifference displayed by the heads\r\nof our Department regarding the hopelessness of these learners'\r\npositions.\"[308] One J. R. Walker was an indoor messenger until\r\nOctober, 1893, when he was apprenticed a paid learner. Shortly before\r\nOctober, two lads had been brought in as paid learners; and, after a\r\nshort service, they were appointed sorting clerks and telegraphists.\r\nThey were promoted over Walker, because of their superior education and\r\nintelligence. Mr. Green, the representative of the Postal Telegraph\r\nClerks' Association, admitted the superior education of the lads in\r\nquestion, but complained that they had been preferred to Walker.[309]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Crompton Episode_]\r\n\r\nOne Crompton, a letter sorting clerk at Liverpool, in his leisure\r\nmoments had made himself a telegraph instrument, had taught himself\r\nto telegraph, and had acquired a considerable technical knowledge of\r\nelectricity. He had attracted the attention of the superintending\r\nengineer at Liverpool; had been promoted, in 1886, to the office of\r\nthe superintending engineer; and, by 1896, he had become one of the\r\nbest engineers in the service. In 1896, Mr. Tipping, the accredited\r\nspokesman of the Postal Telegraphists' Association as well as of the\r\nTelegraph Clerks' Association, complained of the promotion of Crompton,\r\nwhich had occurred in 1886. He said: \"It seems most unreasonable that\r\nmen who have, in some cases, not the slightest acquaintance with\r\ntelegraphic apparatus and methods of working, should be preferred\r\nto those whose whole period of service has been passed in immediate\r\nconnection therewith. It is apparent that such an absence of method is\r\nopen to very serious objections, and allows great freedom of choice\r\nto those upon whose recommendations the appointments are made. In\r\norder, therefore, to safeguard, on the one hand, the interests of\r\nthe department, and, on the other, to encourage those members of the\r\ntelegraph staff who desire, by energy and ability, to improve their\r\nofficial _status_, the following suggestions are humbly submitted: That\r\nvacancies for junior clerkships in the offices of the superintending\r\nengineers, and for clerks at relay stations, should be filled by open\r\ncompetitive examination, held under the control of the Civil Service\r\nCommissioners, and that telegraphists only be eligible.\"[310]\r\n\r\nThe Crompton episode shows what minute supervision over the\r\nadministration of the Post Office the civil service unions seek to\r\nexercise. The same minute supervision was attempted as recently as\r\n1903-04 by Mr. Nannetti, M. P. for the College Division of Dublin,\r\nand also a Member of the Corporation of Dublin, as well as a member\r\nof the Dublin Port and Docks Board.[311] On March 23, 1903, Mr.\r\nNannetti spoke as follows, in the House of Commons: \"I beg to ask the\r\nPostmaster General whether his attention has been directed to the fact\r\nthat two female technical officers, appointed in connection with the\r\nrecently introduced intercommunication switch system in London, were\r\nselected over the heads of seniors possessing equal qualifications,\r\nand whether, seeing that in one case the official selected was taught\r\nswitching duties by a telegraphist who is now passed over, he will\r\nstate the reason for the selection of these officers?\" The Postmaster\r\nGeneral, Mr. Austen Chamberlain, replied: \"The honorable Member has\r\nbeen misinformed. There is no question of promoting or passing over\r\nany officer. All that has been done is to assign to particular duties,\r\ncarrying no special rank or pay, two officers who were believed to be\r\ncompetent to perform them.\" On May 7, 1903, Mr. Nannetti followed up\r\nthe question with another one, namely: \"I beg to ask the Postmaster\r\nGeneral whether his attention has been called to the fact that two\r\nwomen telegraphists were selected to perform technical duties in\r\nreference to the intercommunication switch in London, who were juniors\r\nin service and possessed of less technical qualifications than other\r\nwomen telegraphists who were passed over; and whether, seeing that,\r\nalthough official information was given that such selection was not a\r\nquestion of promotion and no special rank or pay would result, one of\r\nthe two officers concerned has been appointed to a superior grade on\r\naccount of her experience gained by being selected for these duties,\r\nhe will explain why the more senior and experienced women were passed\r\nover in the first place?\" The Postmaster General replied: \"I have\r\nnothing to add to the answer I gave on March 23, beyond stating that\r\nthe officer to whom he is supposed to refer has not been appointed to\r\nany superior grade. She has merely been lent temporarily to assist\r\nat the Central Telephone Exchange in work for which she has special\r\nqualifications.\"[312]\r\n\r\nOn April 19 and May 12, 1904, Mr. Nannetti again protested against\r\nthe promotion of the woman in question to the position of first class\r\nassistant supervisor, saying: \"This girl was appointed because she had\r\nstrong friends at Court.\" ... On the latter date Mr. Nannetti also\r\nintervened on behalf of a telegraphist at North Wall, whose salary had\r\nbeen reduced from $6 a week to $5, as well as on behalf of one Wood,\r\nwho had been retired on a reduced pension, by way of punishment. The\r\ncase of Wood, Mr. Nannetti had brought up in 1903, when the Post Office\r\nVote was under discussion. For the purpose of bringing these several\r\nmatters before the House, he now moved the reduction of the salary of\r\nthe Postmaster General by $500.[313]\r\n\r\nOn March 16, 1903, Mr. Nannetti asked whether the statement of the\r\nController that there was not a man qualified for promotion in the\r\n[Dublin letter sorting] branch had had any influence \"with the\r\nDepartment in the filling of a certain vacancy in the Dublin Post\r\nOffice.\"[314] That question illustrated a type of intervention that\r\nsuggests the possibility of Great Britain reaching the stage that\r\nhas been reached in Australia, where Members of Parliament have been\r\nknown to move reductions in the salaries of officers who had offended\r\nthe rank and file by attempting to introduce businesslike methods\r\nand practices. If that stage ever is reached, there will be a great\r\nmultiplication of cases like the following one. Before the Tweedmouth\r\nCommittee appeared Mr. J. Shephard, Chairman Metropolitan Districts\r\nBoard of Postal Clerks' Association, to champion the cause of Mr. ----.\r\nSaid Mr. Shephard: \"I have it here on his word that his postmaster\r\nhas recommended him for a vacant clerkship at the District Office.\r\nMr. ---- has served for many years under the eyes of this postmaster\r\nwho recommends him for promotion, and I take it that that is full\r\nand sufficient evidence of Mr. ----'s fitness to perform the duties\r\nof the clerk.\" Mr. J. C. Badcock, Controller London Postal Service,\r\ntestified in reply that he had summoned the postmaster in question, who\r\nhad admitted that Mr. ---- had discharged \"minor clerical duties\" in a\r\nperfectly satisfactory manner, but that his recommendation that Mr. ----\r\nshould be promoted to a clerkship, \"was made more out of sympathy with\r\nthe man than with any hope that he would be qualified to undertake\r\nthe higher duties which he would have to succeed to if appointed to a\r\nclerkship.\"[315]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _M. P.'s act in Advance_]\r\n\r\nIn March, 1887, Mr. Bradlaugh, M. P., intervened in the House of\r\nCommons on behalf of two telegraph clerks at Liverpool who feared they\r\nwere about to be passed over in favor \"of a young man who entered the\r\nEngineering Department nine months ago as a temporary foreman.\"[316]\r\n\r\nIn April, 1902, Captain Norton intervened on behalf of two letter\r\nsorters, R. H. Brown and H. Johnson, who feared they were going\r\nto be passed over in the filling of certain vacancies among the\r\noverseers.[317] In 1906, Captain Norton was made a Junior Lord of the\r\nTreasury in the Campbell-Bannerman Liberal Government.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1903, Mr. M. Joyce, M. P. for Limerick as well as an\r\nAlderman, asked the Postmaster General:\r\n\r\n\"Whether it is his intention to promote a local official to the\r\nassistant superintendentship now vacant at the Limerick Post Office,\r\nand, if not, will he assign the reason?... May I ask whether the duties\r\nof this office have not been performed in the most satisfactory manner\r\nby a local officer during the absence of the assistant superintendent,\r\nand will he give this matter due consideration, as every class of the\r\ncommunity would be pleased at such an appointment.\"[318]\r\n\r\nIn April, 1903, Mr. Shehan asked the Postmaster General: \"Whether his\r\nattention has been directed to an application from Dennis Murphy, at\r\npresent acting as auxiliary postman, for appointment to the vacant\r\nposition of rural postman from Mill Street to Culler, County Cork; and\r\nwhether, in view of the man's character and qualifications, he will\r\nconsider the advisability of appointing him to the vacancy?\"[319]\r\n\r\nIn February, 1903, Mr. Nannetti asked the Postmaster General \"whether\r\nhe is aware that a telegraphist named Mercer, of the Bristol Post\r\nOffice, has applied for 160 vacant postmaster ships since 1894;\r\nwhether, seeing that during these periods clerks of less service,\r\nexperience, ability and salary have been the recipients of these\r\npositions, he will make inquiry into the case?\"[320]\r\n\r\nIn July, 1899, Mr. O'Brien,[321] M. P. for Kilkenny, asked the\r\nSecretary to the Treasury, as representing the Postmaster General,\r\n\"whether he is aware that a postman named Jackson, in Kilkenny, has\r\nbeen in the Post Office service over 20 years and that his wages at\r\npresent are only 12s. per week; and whether Jackson was given the\r\nincrement of 1s. 6d. per week fixed by the new wages scale which came\r\ninto operation in April, 1897; and if not, whether he will cause\r\ninquiry to be made into the case, with the view of giving Jackson\r\nthe wages to which he is entitled by the rules of the service?\" Mr.\r\nR. W. Hanbury, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, replied: \"The\r\nrural postman at Kilkenny to whom the Honorable Member refers was\r\ntransferred, on June 19, to another walk at that place, carrying wages\r\nof 16s. a week. His previous duty was not sufficient to warrant higher\r\nwages than 12s. a week.\"[322]\r\n\r\nIn April, 1901, Sir George Newnes, M. P. for Swansea, protested\r\nagainst the promotion out of order, according to seniority, of one\r\nA. E. Samuel, a sorter and telegraphist at Swansea.[323] Sir George\r\nNewnes is the founder of George Newnes, Limited, proprietors _Strand\r\nMagazine_, _Tit-Bits_, etc.; and proprietor of the _Westminster\r\nGazette_, the London evening newspaper of the Liberal Party.\r\n\r\nIn February and March, 1903, Mr. C. E. Schwann, M. P. for Manchester,\r\nprotested against the promotion out of order of two men at Manchester,\r\nwho had been respectively numbers 99 and 133 in their class.[324] Mr.\r\nSchwann is President of the Manchester Reform Club, and has been nine\r\nyears President of the National Reform Union. He has held successively\r\nthe offices of Secretary, Treasurer and President of the Manchester\r\nLiberal Association. In 1900 he was elected to Parliament by a majority\r\nof twenty-six votes.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1902, Mr. Keir Hardie asked the Financial Secretary to\r\nthe Treasury: \"Whether the overseer's vacancy in the South Eastern\r\nMetropolitan district, created by the death of Mr. Feldwick, and\r\nrecently filled by a suburban officer, will now be restored to the\r\ntown establishment, seeing that the appointment properly belongs to\r\nthis establishment?\" Mr. Austen Chamberlain replied: \"The vacancy in\r\nquestion has been filled by the transfer of an overseer from a suburban\r\noffice in the same postal district, but the vacancy thus created in\r\nthe suburbs has been filled by the promotion of an officer in the\r\ntown district office.\" In August, 1902, Mr. Keir Hardie asked the\r\nFinancial Secretary to the Treasury: \"Whether he is aware that the\r\noverseer's vacancy which occurred in the town establishment of the\r\nSouth Eastern Metropolitan District by the promotion of Mr. May to an\r\ninspectorship at another office, has been filled by the transfer of an\r\nofficer in the suburban establishment, thus diverting a town vacancy\r\nto the suburbs; and whether, in view of the fact that the chances of\r\npromotion in the suburban establishments are 75 per cent. better than\r\nin the town establishment, he will cause the vacancy to be restored\r\nto the establishment in which it originally occurred?\" Mr. Austen\r\nChamberlain replied: \"The Postmaster General is aware of the effect of\r\nthe promotion in question, and has already arranged that the balance of\r\npromotion shall be readjusted on an early opportunity by the transfer\r\nof a town [officer] to a suburban vacancy.\"[325]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A Member of the Select Committee on Post Office Servants,\r\n1906_]\r\n\r\nOn March 24, 1905, Mr. Charles Hobhouse, M. P. for Bristol, asked the\r\nPostmaster General \"why a number of men with unblemished character\r\nand with service ranging from 15 to 25 years have, in the recent\r\npromotions in the Bristol Post Office, been passed over in favor of a\r\njunior postman?\" In 1906, Mr. Hobhouse was made a member of the Select\r\nCommittee on Post Office Servants.[326]\r\n\r\nOn March 15, 1906,[327] Mr. Sloan, M. P. for Belfast, intervened on\r\nbehalf of the men who had recently been passed over in the selection of\r\nthree men to act as \"provincial clerks\" in the Post Office at Belfast.\r\n\r\nOn the same day, Mr. Sloan asked the Postmaster General \"under\r\nwhat circumstances the junior head postman at Belfast is retained\r\npermanently on a regular duty while his seniors, equally capable men,\r\nare compelled to rotate on irregular duties with irregular hours.\"\r\n\r\nOn August 2, 1906, the Postmaster General, Mr. Sydney Buxton, replied\r\nto Mr. Sloan: \"I cannot review cases of promotion decided by my\r\npredecessor eighteen months ago.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1905 Mr. Sloan had voted for a Select Committee on Postal Servants'\r\nGrievances.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing quotations could be extended indefinitely, but they\r\nillustrate sufficiently the several kinds of intervention in matters of\r\nmere administrative detail, as well as the high political and social\r\nstanding of some of the Members of Parliament who lend themselves to\r\nthose several kinds of intervention. But these quotations may not be\r\nbrought to an end without mention of the qualifying fact that Lord\r\nStanley, Postmaster General from 1903 to 1905, repeatedly stated in the\r\nHouse of Commons that he did \"not select the senior men unless they\r\nwere best qualified to do the work.\"[328]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[273] _Third Report from the Select Committee on Civil Services\r\nExpenditure_, 1873; q. 4,193 to 4,206, and 4,267.\r\n\r\n[274] _Report from the Select Committee on Post Office_ (_Telegraph\r\nDepartment_), 1876; q. 3,122 to 3,125.\r\n\r\n[275] _Correspondence Relating to the Post Office Telegraph\r\nDepartment_: Letter of April 12, 1877, Postmaster General, Lord John\r\nManners, to the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury.\r\n\r\n[276] _Report from the Select Committee on Post Office_ (_Telegraph\r\nDepartment_), 1876; q. 1,259.\r\n\r\n[277] _Report of the Bradford Committee on Post Office Wages_, 1904; q.\r\n1,024 and 1,048.\r\n\r\n[278] Mr. Lowe, Chancellor of the Exchequer, divided the service into\r\nthree classes, in such a way that it was difficult, if not impossible,\r\nto pass from one class to the other.

Instances of intervention by\r\n     Members of Parliament. Mr. Austen Chamberlain, Financial\r\n     Secretary to the Treasury, in April, 1902, states that at a\r\n     low estimate one-third of the time of the highest officials in\r\n     the Post Office is occupied with petty questions of discipline\r\n     and administrative detail, because of the intervention\r\n     of Members of Parliament. He adds that it is \"absolutely\r\n     deplorable\" that time and energy that should be given to the\r\n     consideration of large questions must be given to matters that\r\n     \"in any private business would be dealt with by the officer\r\n     on the spot.\" Sir John Eldon Gorst's testimony before the\r\n     Committee on National Expenditure, 1902.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _M. P.'s and the Rank and File_]\r\n\r\nIn 1888, Mr. Harvey, a Member of the Royal Commission appointed to\r\ninquire into the Civil Establishments, asked Sir S. A. Blackwood,\r\nSecretary to the Post Office since 1880: \"Now I should like to ask\r\nyou ... whether you consider there is a distinct tendency among the\r\nclerical establishments [_i. e._, the clerks above the rank and file],\r\nespecially the lower division clerks, to develop what for want of a\r\nbetter term I will call trades union spirit?\" \"Yes, I believe there\r\nis a good deal of evidence of that.\" \"Have you, yourself, found it\r\ndifficult to deal with that; is it a factor in your administration\r\n[of the Post Office]?\" \"Not with regard to the lower division clerks\r\n[above the rank and file]; it is with regard to the subordinate ranks\r\nof the service, the rank and file; amongst them there is a very\r\nstrong tendency in that direction.\" \"A growing tendency?\" \"It is\r\ncertainly growing.\" \"A growing tendency then we may say to introduce\r\nthe coöperation of Members of Parliament to deal with individual\r\ngrievances?\" \"A very strongly growing tendency.\" At this point\r\nMr. Lawson interrupted: \"Individual or class grievances?\" \"Class\r\ngrievances, but there are a great many instances in which individual\r\ngrievances are brought forward [by Members of Parliament].\" \"The\r\npoint of the question was whether this spirit of trades unionism was\r\nevoked for the sake of bringing forward individual grievances, and\r\nyou said yes; and then I asked whether it was class grievances or\r\nindividual grievances?\" \"I mean class grievances, but it is made use\r\nof in respect of individual grievances.\" Mr. Harvey resumed: \"And you\r\nthink it is growing?\" \"I think it is strongly growing.\" \"So we may\r\nsay, to repeat the question I put just now, that it makes a factor\r\nin your administration of the Post Office, and you have always to be\r\nprepared to meet this growing tendency?\" \"It is continuously raising\r\ndifficulties, and very serious ones.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lawson queried: \"You said something about trades unionism; do you\r\nthink it is possible by any regulation to stop trades unionism of a\r\ngreat class such as the senior division, or the classes which are the\r\nsubordinate part of your establishment?\" \"I think it would be very\r\ndifficult.\" \"You would have to reckon with that as a permanent factor?\"\r\n\"Yes.\"[329]\r\n\r\nThis intervention on behalf of individual employees is managed as\r\nfollows. Members of Parliament first interview the Postmaster General;\r\nif they fail to obtain satisfaction, they bring the grievance of\r\ntheir constituent before the House of Commons, by means of a question\r\naddressed in the House to the Postmaster General. It will be remembered\r\nthat Mr. Hanbury, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, in 1900 stated\r\nthat he had agreed to represent the Postmaster General in the House\r\nof Commons only on condition that he should be given full freedom to\r\nanswer such questions in any way he saw fit, and that he should not be\r\nbound by any answers furnished him either by the permanent officers\r\nof the Post Office or by the Postmaster General. And that Sir H. H.\r\nFowler protested against the Postmaster General sitting in the House of\r\nLords, on the ground that the questions asked by Members of the House\r\nof Commons often demanded to be answered by a man who had his finger\r\non the pulse of the House, and was able to cut through the red tape of\r\nofficialism on public grounds, which meant, to set aside the rules of\r\nthe Department in response to the exigencies of political expediency.\r\n\r\nIf the answer given by the Postmaster General is unsatisfactory,\r\nthe Member of Parliament gives notice that he will bring the matter\r\nup again on the discussion of the Estimates of Expenditure. In the\r\nmeantime he brings to bear, behind the scenes, what pressure he can\r\ncommand. And he often learns to appreciate the grim humor of the reply\r\nonce given by a former Minister of Railways in Victoria, Australia,\r\nto a Victorian Royal Commission, to the query whether political\r\ninfluence was exercised in the administration of the State railways of\r\nVictoria. The reply had been: \"I should like to know how you can have a\r\npolitician without political influence?\"\r\n\r\nOf course not all cases of intervention by Members of Parliament are as\r\nsuccessful as was the intervention of Mr. Bradlaugh, which resulted in\r\nthe promotion of eleven men out of fourteen who had been passed over\r\nas \"not qualified for promotion,\" or, as was the intervention of the\r\nMember of Parliament whose name was not revealed, which brought about\r\nthe revocation of the promotion of the ablest man in the Post Office\r\nat Sheffield. Indeed, the principal effect of these interventions is\r\nnot to force the Post Office to retrace steps already taken, it is to\r\nprevent the Post Office from taking certain steps. These interventions\r\nmodify the entire administration of the British Post Office. They\r\ncompel the Postmaster General and his leading officers to consider the\r\npolitical aspect of every proposal coming from the local postmasters,\r\nand other intermediate officers, be it a proposal to promote, to\r\npass over, to discipline, or to dismiss. It was this possibility of\r\nintervention by Members of Parliament, acting under pressure from\r\ncivil servants' unions, that gave the late Mr. Fawcett \"a perfect\r\nhorror of passing over,\" that caused Mr. Arnold Morley \"the greatest\r\ndistress\" whenever he had to pass anyone over, and that led Mr. Raikes\r\nto state in the House of Commons, that, \"in the interests of the Public\r\nService, and especially in the interests of the Post Office itself,\"\r\nhe had declined to follow the advice of his officers that he promote\r\na certain clerk in the Secretary's Office; as well as that he made it\r\nhis practice to try to mitigate the rules of the Department governing\r\npunishment and dismissal. It was with the thought of Parliamentary\r\nintervention in mind, that Mr. Austen Chamberlain,[330] Postmaster\r\nGeneral, said, in February, 1903: \"The selection of officers for\r\npromotion is always an invidious task.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Typical Grievances_]\r\n\r\nThe testimony given before the Tweedmouth Committee, 1897, contains a\r\nnumber of incidents which show how leniently the Post Office Department\r\nis obliged to deal with men who violate the rules. These incidents were\r\nbrought before the Committee by the representatives of the employees\r\nof the Post Office, for the purpose of proving by individual cases,\r\nthat the Department's rulings were unduly severe, and afforded just\r\ncause for grievance.\r\n\r\nOne Webster, a letter carrier at Liverpool, in July, 1883, failed to\r\ncover his whole walk, and brought back to the office, letters which\r\nhe should have delivered. These letters he surreptitiously inserted\r\namong the letters of other carriers. Mr. Herbert Joyce, Third Secretary\r\nto General Post Office, said dismissal would not have been harsh\r\npunishment for the offence; but Webster was merely deprived of one\r\ngood conduct stripe, worth 25 cents a week. In 1884 and 1885 Webster's\r\nincrement of salary was arrested for unsatisfactory conduct. In July,\r\n1886, Webster was removed from his walk, and reduced to the \"junior\r\nmen\" on the \"relief force,\" for having been under the influence of\r\ndrink while on duty. In 1890, Webster complained to headquarters of\r\nharsh treatment, stating that though he had served 15 years, he had not\r\nreceived three good conduct stripes. And in 1896, Mr. J. S. Smith, the\r\nofficial representative of the provincial postmen, deemed it expedient\r\nto cite the case to the Tweedmouth Committee in the course of an\r\nargument to the effect that there was too great a difference \"between\r\nthe punishment meted out to postmen and the punishment meted out to\r\nsorters; not that I say the punishment is too slight for sorters, but\r\nit is, I might say, too severe for postmen,\" It may be added that, in\r\n1896, Webster was recommended for three good conduct stripes, though\r\nthe regulation says that a good conduct stripe shall be awarded only\r\nfor five clear and consecutive years of good conduct. Non-observance\r\nof that regulation led the Tweedmouth Committee to report: \"The\r\npractice which has grown up in the Department of awarding two stripes\r\nat the same time to a man whose service exceeds 10 years, but whose\r\nunblemished service extends over only 5 years, is, we think, a bad one,\r\nand should be discontinued.\"[331]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing recommendation of the Tweedmouth Committee was not\r\nendorsed by the Government. On March 13, 1906, the Postmaster General,\r\nMr. Sydney Buxton, in reply to Mr. Thomas Smyth, M. P., who was\r\nintervening on behalf of one Thomas Reilly, said: \"I find that Thomas\r\nReilly would have been entitled to an increase of one shilling and\r\nsix pence a week in his wages as from April 1, 1905, if his conduct\r\nduring the preceding twelve months had been satisfactory. Unfortunately\r\nthe necessary certificate to that effect could not be given, but the\r\nquestion of granting the increase to Reilly will come up again for\r\nconsideration shortly.... It will be necessary to postpone for a time\r\nthe award of a second stripe.\"[332]\r\n\r\nIn October, 1895, one Roberts, an auxiliary postman was warned that he\r\nwould be dismissed unless his conduct improved. He had been reported\r\nfor \"treating parcel receptacles in a rough and reckless manner, and\r\nsmashing the parcels.\" In November, 1895, he altered the address on a\r\nparcel in order to save himself the trouble of delivering the parcel\r\non the day on which he made the alteration. The parcel was given\r\nto a carrier on another route, who returned it as not deliverable.\r\nAfter some delay the parcel finally was delivered by Roberts. When\r\nMr. S. Walpole, Secretary of the Post Office, heard this testimony,\r\nhe exclaimed: \"And was Roberts dismissed on the spot?\" Mr. Badcock,\r\nController London Postal Service, replied: \"No. The overseer described\r\nhim as totally unreliable, and he was warned for the last time.\" Mr.\r\nWalpole continued: \"Why was he not dismissed?\" Mr. Badcock replied:\r\n\"Well, he ought to have been.\" In January, 1896, Roberts was again\r\ncautioned; on February 24, 1896, he failed to attend his morning duty;\r\nand he was seriously cautioned again. In March, 1896, he was guilty\r\nof \"gross carelessness,\" and was told to look for other employment.\r\nThereupon Roberts wrote his postmaster that he was a member of the\r\nPostmen's Federation. Shortly afterward, Mr. Churchfield, Secretary of\r\nthe Postmen's Federation, brought Roberts' case before the Tweedmouth\r\nCommittee, alleging that the Post Office Department had dismissed\r\nRoberts because he had supplied evidence to the representatives of the\r\npostal employees who had appeared before the Tweedmouth Committee.[333]\r\n\r\nIn 1878, one Woodhouse, a postman at Norwich, was suspended for two\r\ndays for irregular attendance, having been late 42 times in three\r\nmonths. In 1880, he was suspended for three days, having been late 173\r\ntimes during the year. Woodhouse also had been very troublesome to the\r\ninspector, setting a bad example to the younger men. In 1882, he was\r\nabsent from duty because of intoxication, was grossly insubordinate\r\nto the local postmaster, whom he set at defiance, and also grossly\r\ninsubordinate to the surveyor. The local postmaster recommended that\r\nhe be dismissed. \"At headquarters, however, with a large, and some\r\npeople think a very undue, leniency, it was decided to give him one\r\nmore trial.\" In 1889, Woodhouse was cautioned by the postmaster\r\nfor insubordinate conduct to the inspector. In 1891 and 1892, the\r\npostmaster refused to recommend him for good conduct stripes. In 1894\r\nthere was a marked improvement in Woodhouse's conduct. The improvement\r\nwas maintained, and in 1896, Woodhouse was recommended for good conduct\r\nstripes. Of this man, Mr. J. S. Smith, the official representative of\r\nthe provincial postmen, said, in 1896, before the Tweedmouth Committee:\r\n\"The last 17 or 18 years of Woodhouse's career have been of a most\r\nexemplary description, a good time-keeper and zealous in the discharge\r\nof his duties, and yet, though he had been a postman for 25 years, he\r\nhas never been the recipient of a good conduct stripe. By this means\r\nhe has been deprived of about $450, truly a great loss for a postman\r\nto suffer through having this vast sum deducted from his wages. It\r\nneeds no words of mine to point out the great injustice that has\r\nbeen inflicted upon Woodhouse. Any little irregularity that may have\r\noccurred (such as bad time-keeping, which is admitted) in the first 7\r\nor 8 years of his service, has been amply atoned for by 17 or 18 years'\r\npunctuality and excellent behavior.\"[334]\r\n\r\nIn November, 1895, a letter carrier at Manchester came \"under the\r\ninfluence of drink,\" and reached at 3.50 p. m. a point in his walk\r\nwhich he should have reached at 2.30 p. m. \"On the following day he was\r\nagain under the influence of drink and unfit to make his delivery.\" The\r\npunishment was the deprivation of one good conduct stripe.[335]\r\n\r\nIn December, 1895, a postman at Newcastle, while off duty, but in\r\nuniform, \"was reeling along [one of the principal streets] intoxicated\r\nat 3 p. m.\" The case was sent up to the Postmaster General, who decided\r\nthat the man should lose one good conduct stripe. Mr. Spencer Walpole,\r\na member of the Tweedmouth Committee, and the Permanent Secretary\r\nto the Post Office, said dismissal would not have been too severe a\r\npunishment; and Mr. H. Joyce, Third Secretary General Post Office,\r\nLondon, assented to the statement.[336]\r\n\r\nMr. Badcock, Controller London Postal Service, in replying to the\r\ntestimony of Mr. A. F. Harris, the official representative of the\r\nLondon postmen, said that it was true that while one Worth for some\r\nyears past had off and on been made an acting head postman, he had\r\nnot been recommended for promotion to the position of head postman,\r\nbecause his postmaster had reported that he was \"shifty, unreliable,\r\nand careless.\" Mr. Walpole, Secretary of the Post Office, thereupon\r\nqueried: \"Is that not a reason for not employing him to act as head\r\npostman?\" Mr. Badcock replied: \"It was thought better to give him a\r\nchance, instead of letting him have the grievance of complaining that\r\nhe had not had an opportunity of showing whether he was qualified.\" Mr.\r\nWalpole continued: \"But if he showed himself shifty, unreliable, and\r\ncareless for several years, ought not his trial as a head postman to\r\ncease?\" Mr. Badcock replied: \"I must confess that I think so.\"[337]\r\n\r\nIn February, 1887, Mr. Marum intervened in the House of Commons on\r\nbehalf of one Ward, a telegraphist, who had been dismissed in 1876\r\nbecause he had discharged his duties unsatisfactorily.[338]\r\n\r\nIn February, 1888, Mr. Lawson, a Member of the Royal Commission\r\nappointed to inquire into the Civil Establishments, intervened on\r\nbehalf of one Harvey, a letter carrier who had been dismissed in\r\n1882.[339]\r\n\r\nIn March, 1901, Mr. Bartley[340] intervened on behalf of one Canless,\r\nwho had been dismissed because the Postmaster General \"was of the\r\nopinion that Mr. Canless was not a fit person to be retained in the\r\nservice.\" On dismissing the man, the Post Office had deducted from his\r\npay the value of a postal money order--$2.25--alleged to have been\r\nstolen by him.[341] Canless' case was brought up again in August,\r\n1904, upon the occasion of the debate upon the Report of the Bradford\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1897, Mr. C. Seale-Hayne intervened on behalf of one J. C.\r\nKinsman, dismissed for insubordination and delegation of his duties to\r\nunauthorized persons.[342]\r\n\r\nIn August, 1903, Mr. Sloan, M. P. for Belfast, intervened on behalf of\r\none Templeton, of the Belfast Post Office, dismissed for emptying ink\r\non the head of a workman engaged in the Post Office.[343]\r\n\r\nIn March, 1905, Mr. John Campbell, M. P., tried to induce the\r\nPostmaster General to reopen the case of one M'Cusker, who had been\r\ndisciplined in 1897.[344]\r\n\r\nIn April, 1899, Mr. Lenty asked for a pension for one Wright, whose\r\n\"conduct had been such as to render him unfit for further employment in\r\nthe public service.\"[345]\r\n\r\nIn August, 1902, Mr. Crean asked for a pension for W. H. Allshire, \"Who\r\nwas reported for certain irregularities for which he would probably\r\nhave been dismissed. While the matter was under consideration he sent\r\nin his resignation, which was accepted.\"[346]\r\n\r\nIn August, 1903, Mr. L. Sinclair intervened on behalf of B. J. Foreman,\r\n\"who was not qualified for the award of a pension, as he was neither 60\r\nyears of age nor incapacitated from the performance of his duty\" when\r\nhis service was terminated.[347]\r\n\r\nIn March, 1891, Earl Compton intervened on behalf of a first class\r\nsorter who had been reduced to the second class after having been\r\nsentenced to a fine by a Police Magistrate.[348]\r\n\r\nIn December, 1893, Mr. Keir Hardie asked the\r\n\r\nPostmaster General to modify the rules governing fines for being late\r\nat duty. In February, 1899, Mr. Maddison made a similar request.[349]\r\n\r\nIn October, 1902, Mr. Palmer intervened on behalf of some \"learners\"\r\nat Reading, who had been punished \"for careless performance of their\r\nduties, leading to serious delay in the delivery of telegrams.\"[350]\r\nMr. Palmer, a biscuit manufacturer, was the Member for Reading. In the\r\npast he had been an Alderman as well as the Mayor of Reading.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1901, Mr. Groves intervened on behalf of a postman at\r\nManchester from whom annual increments of pay had been withheld under\r\nthe rules governing irregular attendance.[351] Mr. Groves is Chairman\r\nof the South Salford Conservative Association.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1900, Mr. Steadman said: \"I honestly admit that this\r\nquestion business might be overdone; but at the same time, if anyone,\r\npostman or anyone else, thinks I can do his case any good by putting\r\ndown a question, I shall always do so as long as I am a Member of this\r\nHouse.\" Mr. Steadman proved as good as his boast; and in July, 1900,\r\nhe intervened on behalf of a man from whom the Post Office Department\r\nhad withheld two good conduct stripes \"because he had absented himself\r\nfrequently on insufficient plea of illness.\" Mr. Steadman stood ready\r\nto shield any malingerer who might apply to him, though malingering is\r\na serious evil in the Post Office service. For example, in 1901 the\r\naverage number of days' absence on sick-leave was 7.6 days for the men\r\nin that part of the staff that receives full pay during sick-leave, as\r\nagainst 5.2 days for the men in that part of the staff that receives\r\nonly half-pay during sick-leave.[352] Mr. Steadman had been elected to\r\nParliament by a majority of 20 votes. He is at present a Member of the\r\nLondon County Council.[353]\r\n\r\nIn June, 1906, Mr. Sydney Buxton, who had become Postmaster General,\r\nupon the formation of the Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman Ministry, in\r\nDecember, 1905, expressed himself as follows:[354] \"He was informed\r\na little while ago by his private secretary that in the ordinary way\r\n60 or 70 applications of various sorts were made by honorable Members\r\nin the course of a calendar month, but that for some months past, in\r\nconsequence perhaps of there being a new Government, a new Parliament,\r\nnew Members, and a new Postmaster General, the number of applications\r\nof all sorts had amounted to between 300 and 400 per month.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A Member of the Select Committee on Post Office Servants,\r\n1906_]\r\n\r\nIn May, 1906, Mr. J. Ward, a Member of the Select Committee on\r\nPost Office Servants, 1906, asked the Postmaster General \"whether\r\nhis attention had been called to the dismissal of E. C. Feasey, of\r\nWalsall, who had been an efficient officer in the postal service\r\nfor 17 years ... and whether he will reconsider the question of the\r\nman's reinstatement?\" Mr. Buxton replied: \"I have looked into the\r\ncircumstances connected with the dismissal by my predecessor of E. C.\r\nFeasey, formerly a town postman at Walsall. I find that Feasey had\r\na most unsatisfactory record.... I am not prepared to consider the\r\nquestion of reinstatement.\"[355]\r\n\r\nIn March, 1906, the Postmaster General, in reply to Mr. Nannetti,\r\nM. P., said: \"The Reports and statements in the Corcoran case were\r\nfully considered at the time [1901], and I can see no good purpose in\r\nreopening the matter after a lapse of five years.\"[356]\r\n\r\nIn April, 1906, Mr. Wiles,[357] M. P., intervened on behalf of the\r\nhead messenger in the Secretary's Office at the General Post Office,\r\nLondon. Under the administration of Lord Stanley, Postmaster General,\r\nan allowance of 4 shillings a week given the head messenger at the time\r\nof his appointment, had been withheld from October, 1900, to October,\r\n1905. Mr. Sydney Buxton replied: \"I have already had this case under my\r\nconsideration. The allowance of 4 shillings a week is being granted,\r\nbut unfortunately the allowance cannot be made retrospective.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wiles had been elected to Parliament in January, 1906, having\r\ndefeated Sir Albert K. Rollit, who, for many years, had made a\r\nspecialty of championing the cause of Post Office employees who had a\r\ngrievance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Deplorable Waste of Executive Ability_]\r\n\r\nIn April, 1902, Mr. Austen Chamberlain, Financial Secretary to the\r\nTreasury, and representative in the House of Commons of the Postmaster\r\nGeneral, the Marquis of Londonderry, said: \"In a great administration\r\nlike this there must be decentralization, and how difficult it is to\r\ndecentralize, either in the Post Office or in the Army, when working\r\nunder constant examination by question and answer in this House, no\r\nhonorable Member who has not had experience of official life can easily\r\nrealize. But there must be decentralization, because every little petty\r\nmatter cannot be dealt with by the Postmaster General or the Permanent\r\nSecretary to the Post Office. Their attention should be reserved in\r\nthe main for large questions, and I think it is deplorable, absolutely\r\ndeplorable, that so much of their time should be occupied, as under the\r\npresent circumstances it necessarily is occupied, with matters of very\r\nsmall detail, because these matters of detail are asked by honorable\r\nMembers, and because we do not feel an honorable Member will accept an\r\nanswer from anyone but the highest authority. I think a third of the\r\ntime--I am putting it at a low estimate--of the highest officials in\r\nthe Post Office is occupied in answering questions raised by Members of\r\nthis House, and in providing me with information in order that I may\r\nbe in a position to answer the inquiries addressed to me\" concerning\r\nmatters which, \"in any private business, would be dealt with by the\r\nofficer on the spot, without appeal or consideration unless grievous\r\ncause were shown.\"[358]\r\n\r\nIn March, 1903, Mr. Austen Chamberlain, Postmaster General, read\r\nthe following Post Office Rule: \"A postmaster is to address to his\r\nsurveyor, and a subordinate officer is to address to the postmaster\r\n(who will forward it to his surveyor), any application from himself\r\nhaving reference to his duties or pay, or any communications he may\r\ndesire to make relating to official matters; and if the applicant is\r\ndissatisfied with the result he may appeal direct to the Postmaster\r\nGeneral. But it is strictly forbidden to make any such application or\r\nother communication through the public, or to procure one to be made by\r\nMembers of Parliament, or others; and should an irregular application\r\nbe received, the officer on whose behalf it is made will be subject to\r\ncensure or punishment proportionate to the extent of his participation\r\nin the violation of the rule.\" Mr. Chamberlain added: \"But it has been\r\nmy practice [as well as that of Mr. Chamberlain's predecessors] to\r\ntreat the rule as applying only to applications so made in the first\r\ninstance, and I have raised no objection to an officer who had appealed\r\nto me, and was dissatisfied with my decision, applying subsequently to\r\na Member of Parliament.\"[359]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Post Office is not the only British Department of State which is\r\nobliged to consider with care how far it may go counter to individual\r\ninterests in enforcing rules and standards adopted for the preservation\r\nof the public interest.\r\n\r\nBefore the Select Committee on National Expenditure, 1902, Sir John\r\nEldon Gorst, M. P., and Vice-President of the Committee of Council\r\non Education, 1895 to 1902, said: \"What I want to impress upon the\r\nCommittee is that Parliament has never an influence which goes for\r\neconomy of any kind in the expenditure of public money on education\r\n[about $40,000,000 a year]. Then I hope I have now shown the Committee\r\nthat the only security the public has that what it spends will be\r\nefficiently spent is the system of inspection. Earlier in my evidence\r\nI also pointed out the two systems which are in vogue for inspection,\r\nnamely the South Kensington system and the Whitehall system. The\r\nWhitehall system, which deals with the larger amount of public money,\r\nis extremely inefficient. The Elementary Education Inspectors have\r\nbefore their eyes the fear, first of all, of the managers of the\r\nschools which they visit. The managers of the schools are often\r\nimportant School Boards like the School Board of London, which is not\r\na body to be trifled with, which has very great influence, both in\r\nParliament and in the Education Department, and which the Inspectors\r\nare very much afraid of offending. But it is not only powerful School\r\nBoards, but any managers [of schools] can take the matter up. If an\r\nInspector goes into a school and sees [reports] that the children are\r\ndirty, or that the school is dirty, or that the teacher is inefficient,\r\nthe manager is up in arms at once, and writes a letter to the Board of\r\nEducation, and comes up and sees the Secretary, and protests against\r\nthe Inspector for having dared to make an unfavorable report of his\r\nor her school. Besides that, the Inspectors have before their eyes\r\nthe fear of the National Union of Teachers. Almost every teacher now\r\nis a member of the National Union of Teachers, and if an Inspector is\r\nsupposed to be severe, a teacher complains at once to the National\r\nUnion, and the case is taken up, possibly even in Parliament, by some\r\nof the officials of the National Union of Teachers in Parliament, and\r\nit is made very uncomfortable for the Inspector. Then, lastly, they\r\n[_i. e._, the Inspectors] have the office--that is not, say, their own\r\nChief Inspector, but the officials of the office, who do not like an\r\nInspector who makes trouble. The great art of an Inspector is to get\r\non well with the managers [of schools] and teachers, and to make no\r\ntrouble at all. I have known cases of adverse reports which were not\r\nliked at the office being sent back to the Inspector to alter,\" not by\r\nthe Chief Inspector, or Senior Inspector of the District, but by some\r\nother person in the office.[360]\r\n\r\nSir John Eldon Gorst was Solicitor-General in 1885-86, Under Secretary\r\nfor India in 1886 to 1891, Financial Secretary to the Treasury in\r\n1891-92, Deputy Chairman of Committees of the House of Commons in 1888\r\nto 1891, and Vice-President of Council on Education in 1885 to 1902. He\r\nwas a Member of the House of Commons in 1866 to 1868, and has been a\r\nmember continuously since 1875. Since 1892 he has sat as representative\r\nof the University of Cambridge.\r\n\r\nSir John Eldon Gorst was by no means unwilling to take his share of\r\nblame for the mismanagement in the various Departments of State arising\r\nout of the intervention of the House of Commons--under pressure from\r\nthe constituencies, or organized groups in the constituencies--in\r\nthe administrative details of the Departments of State. He said: \"I\r\nhave been as great a sinner as anyone in the days when I represented\r\nChatham,[361] before I was a Member of the Government; I was\r\nperpetually urging the Secretary of the Admiralty for the time being to\r\nincrease the expenditures at the dockyards\"[362] [in the interest of\r\nthe laborers in the dockyards and of the merchants and manufacturers\r\nwho have raw materials to sell to the dockyards].\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[329] _Second Report of the Royal Commission appointed to inquire into\r\nthe Civil Establishments_, 1888; Sir S.

The hours of\r\n     work may not be increased without compensating every one\r\n     affected. Administrative \"mistakes\" may not be corrected\r\n     without compensating the past beneficiaries of such\r\n     mistakes. Violation of the order that promotion must not\r\n     be mechanical, or by seniority alone, may not be corrected\r\n     without compensating those civil servants who would have\r\n     been benefitted by the continued violation of the aforesaid\r\n     order. The State may not demand increased efficiency of its\r\n     servants without compensating every one affected. Persons\r\n     filling positions for which there is no further need, must\r\n     be compensated. Each civil servant has a \"vested right\" to\r\n     the maintenance of such rate of promotion as obtains when he\r\n     enters the service, irrespective of the volume of business or\r\n     of any diminution in the number of higher posts consequent\r\n     upon administrative reforms. The telegraph clerks demand that\r\n     their chances of promotion be made as good as those of the\r\n     postal clerks proper, but they refuse to avail themselves of\r\n     the opportunity to pass over to the postal side proper of\r\n     the service, on the ground that the postal duties proper are\r\n     more irksome than the telegraph duties. Members of Parliament\r\n     support recalcitrant telegraph clerks whom the Government is\r\n     attempting to force to learn to perform postal duties, in\r\n     order that it may reap advantage from having combined the\r\n     postal service and the telegraph service in 1870. Special\r\n     allowances may not be discontinued; and vacations may not\r\n     be shortened, without safeguarding all \"vested interests.\"\r\n     Further illustrations of the hopelessly unbusinesslike spirit\r\n     of the rank and file of the public servants.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon a preceding page has been mentioned the contention of the civil\r\nservants that there is an implied contract between the State and the\r\nCivil Service that the conditions of employment obtaining at any\r\nmoment shall not be changed to the disadvantage of the civil servants,\r\nexcept upon payment of compensation to all persons disadvantageously\r\naffected; and that unless such compensation is paid, any change in the\r\nconditions and terms of employment must be limited to future entrants\r\nupon the service of the State, or to persons who shall accept promotion\r\non the express condition of becoming subject to the altered terms of\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Implied Contract for Six Hour Day_]\r\n\r\nBefore the Select Committee on Civil Services Expenditure, 1873, Mr.\r\nW. E. Baxter, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, said: \"I am not an\r\nadvocate for long hours; and in the mercantile business with which I am\r\nconnected, I have years ago reduced the hours both of the clerks and of\r\nthe workmen, but I am inclined to think the six hours given to their\r\nwork by the Government officials [that is, Upper and Lower Division\r\nclerks], rather too short a period, and that it might with advantage\r\nbe somewhat lengthened. At the same time we must always keep in mind\r\nthat the effect of lengthening the hours would be to cause an immediate\r\ndemand for an increase of pay. However I have a very strong impression\r\nthat in most of the Government offices there are too many clerks, and\r\nthat there might be considerable economy in a reduction of numbers and\r\nan increase of hours.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer stated to the Committee that it would\r\nbe inexpedient to try to raise the hours of clerks from 6 hours to,\r\nsay, 7 hours. He said: \"I suspect that my one-seventh more time would\r\nbe more than compensated by my having to pay them a great deal more\r\nthan one-seventh more salary; and I think it would be very perilous to\r\ntake up the floodgates in that way.\"[363]\r\n\r\nBefore the Royal Commission appointed to inquire into the Civil\r\nEstablishments, 1888, Sir Reginald E. Welby, Permanent Secretary to\r\nthe Treasury, stated that he was in favor of extending the hours of\r\nthe Upper and Lower Division clerks from 6 hours to 7. The Chairman\r\nqueried: \"But can it be done with existing clerks without a breach\r\nof faith?\" Sir R. E. Welby replied: \"With regard to Lower Division\r\nclerks, it is provided that in consideration of an extra payment, which\r\nis according to the regulation, a 6 hour office can be turned into a\r\n7 hour office.... There is no provision of that kind for the Upper\r\nDivision, and, of course, any change would have to be made a matter\r\nof consideration.... The arrangement made between the authorities\r\nof the Inland Revenue and the Treasury, in those departments of the\r\nInland Revenue which have adopted the 7 hours system, has been that\r\nthe clerks who were under no stipulation to do 7 hours' work, should\r\nhave an extra allowance until promotion. As soon as they are promoted\r\nto another class, we have assumed that we have the right to put our\r\nconditions upon the promotion, and, therefore, from that time they fall\r\ninto the ordinary scale of salary without addition.\" At this point Mr.\r\nH. H. Fowler, a Member of the Commission, queried: \"I understand you to\r\nsay there is no provision made for altering the period of service of an\r\nUpper Division clerk from 6 hours to 7 hours. I want to know where is\r\nthe document by which the State binds itself over to accept 6 hours'\r\nwork ...?\" \"Nowhere. The only thing is that when he enters the office\r\nhe is told that the hours are from 10 to 4, or from 11 to 5.\" Mr.\r\nFowler continued: \"I consider this is a question of vital importance,\r\nand I want to have it very distinctly from you: I want to know where\r\nis the contract between the State and any Upper Division clerk in any\r\ndepartment, that he is only to work 6 hours a day?\" \"There is no such\r\ndocument that I know of, and no such understanding further than the\r\nstatement upon his entering the office that the hours are such and\r\nsuch.\" \"But I want to ascertain whether there would be even an approach\r\nto a breach of faith (if such a term may be used) if the State says:\r\n'We insist upon our servants working for us 7 hours a day?'\" \"None in\r\nmy mind, and I may add that it is generally known that the hours are so\r\nand so, but longer hours when required\" [on exceptionally busy days].\r\n\r\nTo Sir T. H. Farrer, Permanent Secretary to the Board of Trade, 1867\r\nto 1886, the Chairman of the Royal commission said: \"What is your view\r\nwith reference to its being fair or necessary to increase the pay if\r\nseven hours' work be asked from an Upper Division clerk. Do you think\r\nthere is any contract to do only 6 hours' work?\" \"No, there is no\r\ncontract whatever; theoretically the rule is that civil servants are\r\nto do the business that is required of them. The practical difficulty\r\nremains that if you do it you may have a great uproar. You may cause\r\ndiscontent, and you may have, as I said before, pressure in the House\r\nof Commons; but theoretically, and as a matter of right, I can see no\r\nreason why every officer should not be obliged to give 7 hours for\r\nthe existing pay.\" \"Have you not to some extent recognized it[364] by\r\ncreating a different scale of pay in the Lower Division for 7 hours\r\nthan for 6 hours?\" \"Yes, you have, and I am very sorry for it; when\r\nI say you have, I was a party to it,[365] but I am sorry that we did\r\nit.\" \"But you are of course of opinion that when you announce that the\r\noffice hours are from 10 to 4, it means that these are the hours of\r\npublic attendance, but that it does not in any way prevent the head of\r\nthe office from asking the clerks to stop until the work is done?\" \"No;\r\nbut the larger your class of Lower Division clerks, the more you will\r\nfind that the hours become fixed hours, and if they are asked to attend\r\nbeyond them [because of unusual pressure of work], they will ask for\r\nextra pay for attendance.\"[366]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Clerks are Clerks_]\r\n\r\nIn 1881, Mr. Fawcett, Postmaster General, created for the provincial\r\ntowns the class of \"telegraph clerks,\" who are recruited from the\r\nfirst class of telegraphists, and act as assistants to the assistant\r\nsuperintendents. Since the men in question were styled clerks, they\r\nimmediately contended that their hours of work should be reduced from\r\n8 hours a day to 39 hours a week, the hours of the clerks proper.\r\nThe Department always has refused to recognize that claim. But Mr.\r\nBeaufort, Postmaster at Manchester, acting on a misreading of the\r\nrules, from 1884 to 1890 granted the telegraph clerks at Manchester\r\nthe 39 hours a week. In 1892 the hours were raised to the correct\r\nnumber, namely 8 hours a day, with half an hour for a meal. In 1896,\r\n9 telegraph clerks from Manchester sent a spokesman to the Tweedmouth\r\nCommittee to state that they had become telegraph clerks in 1890, when\r\nthe hours were 35 a week, and that they deemed it a \"hardship\" to be\r\ncompelled to work 8 hours a day.[367]\r\n\r\nIn November, 1902, Mr. Austen Chamberlain, Financial Secretary to\r\nthe Treasury, stated in the House of Commons: \"The town postmen at\r\nNewton Abbot were formerly paid on too high a scale [in consequence\r\nof an error of judgment made by a departmental officer]. The wages\r\nwere accordingly reduced some years ago, but the postmen then in the\r\nservice were allowed to retain their old scale of payment so long as\r\nthey should remain in the service, and the new scale was applied only\r\nto postmen who entered the service subsequently. This will account for\r\nthere being temporarily two scales for postmen at Newton Abbott.\"[368]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Standard of Efficiency should not be Raised_]\r\n\r\nIn 1881, Mr. Fawcett, Postmaster General, established for Metropolitan\r\nLondon the class of \"senior telegraphists,\" with a salary rising by\r\nannual increments of $40, from $800 to $950. He intended that this\r\nclass should be filled by the promotion of men from the first class\r\nof telegraphists who possessed exceptional manipulative efficiency\r\nas well as sufficient executive ability to act as assistants to the\r\nassistant superintendents. But as a matter of fact many men were\r\npromoted to this class by mere seniority and without reference to their\r\nqualifications. In 1890, however, under Mr. Raikes, Postmaster General,\r\nthe Department resolved to promote to the senior class no more men who\r\nwere not fully qualified.[369] And in 1894, the Department imposed a\r\ntechnical examination[370] between the first class of telegraphists\r\nand the senior class, in order to insure that all men promoted to the\r\nsenior class should have the qualifications required of them. Mr. H.\r\nC. Fischer, Controller of the London Central Telegraph Office, said\r\nof this examination: \"It is not considered unjust that this should\r\nhave been enforced in the case of men who had always been employed\r\non instrument duties, and who had only themselves to blame if they\r\nneglected to acquire some knowledge of technical matters, which all\r\nskilled telegraphists are expected to possess.... Even before the\r\ninstitution of the examination it was always held that the possession\r\nof technical knowledge gave the man an additional claim to promotion to\r\nthe senior class.\"[371]\r\n\r\nBefore the Tweedmouth Committee the representatives of the first class\r\ntelegraphists complained of the technical examination as a \"grievance.\"\r\nThey said: \"The regulation came into operation at once, an act which\r\nis regarded as exceptionally unjust toward men of more than 20 years'\r\nservice, who, up to that time had understood from the general practice\r\nof the Department, that, other things being equal, good conduct and\r\nmanipulative efficiency would secure promotion. Now, however, the\r\npossession of technical knowledge is added as a necessary qualification\r\nbefore promotion to the senior class, and this without a coincident\r\nrise in the maximum [salary] of the first class as compensation for the\r\nadditional demand upon the capacity of the staff.\" As the alternative\r\nto the raising of the maximum salary of the first class [$800], \"it\r\nwas earnestly contended that the scale to which the officer is raised\r\non passing the examination should be materially enhanced [beyond the\r\npresent maximum of $950] in recompense for the further additional\r\ndemand upon his time, and for his pecuniary outlay in preparing himself\r\nfor the requirements of the Department.\"[372]\r\n\r\nPrior to November, 1886, special intelligence was required of the\r\nsorters of foreign letters in the London Central Post Office, who were\r\ncorrespondingly well paid. The wages of the first class of sorters\r\nof foreign letters began at $13.75 a week, and rose to $17.50, by\r\ntriennial increments of $1.25 a week. Those of the second class\r\nbegan at $11.25, and rose to $13.75, by annual increments of $0.50 a\r\nweek. But in consequence of a material simplification of the duties\r\nof the foreign letter sorters, consequent upon the changes in the\r\ninternational postage charges, the Department resolved, in November,\r\n1886, to replace the two classes of sorters of foreign letters by\r\none class, with wages ranging from $12.50 a week to $15.[373] It\r\nwas provided, however, that the existing sorters of the first class\r\nshould retain the old scale of wages; and that the existing sorters\r\nof the second class should have the option of immediate promotion to\r\nthe new class, with wages rising from $12.50 to $15, or, \"of being\r\nadvanced to the $13.75 to $17.50 scale, in the order in which they\r\nwould have attained to that scale if the old first class scale had\r\nnot been abolished.\" In other words, the men who, prior to November,\r\n1886, had been in line for ultimate promotion to a class carrying wages\r\nof $13.75 to $17.50, were offered the option \"of being regarded as\r\nhaving a vested interest to rise to $17.50 a week, as vacancies should\r\noccur.\"[374]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Claim of Exemption from Vicissitudes of Life_]\r\n\r\nIn 1895, Mr. H. B. Irons, a second class sorter in London, appeared\r\nbefore the Tweedmouth Committee to present the grievance of himself\r\nand colleagues, who, prior to 1886, had given up the position of\r\nfirst class letter carriers to become second class letter sorters in\r\norder to improve their prospects of promotion. The grievance was that\r\nthe prospects of promotion of letter sorters had been curtailed by\r\nthe abolition of the sorterships of foreign letters in 1886, and the\r\nabolition of the sortership of the first class of inland and foreign\r\nnewspapers in 1890. Mr. Irons alleged that he would have remained\r\na letter carrier had he foreseen the changes in question.[375] His\r\nargument was that the civil servant must be exempt from the ordinary\r\nchances and vicissitudes of life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1890 some senior telegraphists protested that they ought to be made\r\nassistant superintendents, alleging that they were performing the\r\nduties of assistant superintendents. Mr. Raikes, Postmaster General,\r\nfound that some of the duties of the complainants were of the nature\r\nalleged, but not all of them. Therefore, he made the complainants,\r\nforty-nine in number, second class assistant superintendents. By 1896,\r\nthis new class had come to number sixty-five.\r\n\r\nFrom 1881 to 1890, the proportion borne by the senior telegraphists to\r\nthe first class and second class telegraphists had ranged between 1 to\r\n6.6 and 1 to 7.7. The promotion of forty-nine senior telegraphists in\r\n1890, and of the others in subsequent years, raised the proportion in\r\nquestion to 1 to 10, in 1895. But counting senior telegraphists and\r\nsecond class assistant superintendents, there was, in 1895, one of\r\nthese superior officers to each 6.5 of first class and second class\r\ntelegraphists. In other words, the rate of promotion of first class\r\nand second class telegraphists to appointments superior to the first\r\nclass of telegraphists, but inferior to the position of assistant\r\nsuperintendent, had been more rapid in 1891 to 1895, than it had been\r\nin 1881 to 1890.\r\n\r\nIn 1895, Mr. Nicholson, Chairman London Branch of the Postal Telegraph\r\nClerks' Association, appeared before the Tweedmouth Committee to voice\r\nthe grievance of the first class and second class telegraphists, which\r\nwas, that the rate of promotion from the second class and first class\r\nhad decreased, as shown by the fact that there was only one senior\r\ntelegraphist to each ten first class and second class telegraphists.\r\nMr. Nicholson contended that the increase of telegraphic messages\r\nconsequent upon the introduction of the charge of 12 cents for 12\r\nwords had necessitated the creation of a new class, the second\r\nclass superintendents; and that the first class and second class\r\ntelegraphists had a right to demand that they should derive benefit\r\nfrom that increase of traffic and that necessity of creating a new\r\nclass of officers. That the Department's failure to fill the vacancies\r\ncreated in the senior class of telegraphists by promotions to the\r\nclass of second class superintendents, had deprived the first class\r\nand second class telegraphists of all advantage arising out of the\r\ncreation of a new class of officers, the second class assistant\r\nsuperintendents.[376]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Right to Fixed Rate of Promotion_]\r\n\r\nThe nature of the claim made by the Chairman London Branch of the\r\nPostal Telegraph Clerks' Association is forcibly illustrated by the\r\nfollowing incident from the proceedings of the Royal Commission\r\non Civil Establishments, 1888. Mr. H. A. Davies, the official\r\nrepresentative of the clerks in the Receiver and Accountant General's\r\nOffice of the General Post Office, had made a similar demand on behalf\r\nof the men whom he represented. The Chairman asked him: \"Does a man\r\nenter the public service on the assumption that all the upper places\r\nare to remain the same as when he enters.... If you and I enter the\r\npublic service finding a certain Department, the Post Office or any\r\nother, with twenty posts above to which we had a reasonable hope, if we\r\nbehaved well, and showed merit; if administrative reform takes away\r\nfive of these posts, are we entitled to compensation, because that is\r\nwhat it [your allegation of grievance] comes to? Can you say, there\r\nbeing no contract whatever between me and the State when I entered\r\nthe office as a clerk, no contract whatever that I should attain to\r\na higher post, except when there is a vacancy, that I have a claim\r\n[to compensation] when administrative reform takes away some of the\r\nother places?\" The spokesman of the Post Office clerks replied: \"If\r\nI were defending that [position] to Parliament, I think I should say\r\nthat the country has a certain duty toward men who, when they entered\r\nthe service, had, judging by the precedents of their office, a fair\r\nprospect of reasonable promotion, and that if any economy is effected\r\nby subsequent administrative reforms, the sufferers deserve some\r\nconsideration.\"[377]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom 1885 to 1888 Mr. Lawson, M. P.,[378] was a Member of the Royal\r\nCommission appointed to inquire into the Civil Establishments. In\r\nMarch, 1889, he intervened in the administration of the Post Office\r\nby asking the Postmaster General how many vacancies there were in the\r\nfirst class of telegraphists at the Central Telegraph Office, London;\r\nhow long those vacancies had been open, and whether the Postmaster\r\nGeneral had received a petition from the second class telegraphists for\r\ntheir promotion; and whether there was anything to prevent him from\r\ncomplying with the request. The Postmaster General replied that on\r\nJanuary 1, 1889, there had been 53 vacancies. \"To thirty-four of those\r\nvacancies I have made promotions within the last few days; and this,\r\npractically, is an answer to the petition of December, 1888.\"[379] The\r\nreader will recall that in February, 1888, Mr. Lawson had intervened on\r\nbehalf of a letter carrier who had been dismissed in 1882. In 1889 to\r\n1892, and 1897 to 1904, Mr. Lawson was a Member of the London County\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1902, Mr. Hay, M. P.,[380] asked the Postmaster General,\r\nthrough the Financial Secretary to the Treasury: \"With reference to\r\nthe fact that the proportion of appointments above $800 a year in the\r\nCentral Telegraph Office, London, now bears the same relation to the\r\nstaff below that salary as during the period when the circular [1881 to\r\n1891] was issued promising a prospect of $950, whether he is aware that\r\nduring the years 1882 to 1892 the proportion was one appointment above\r\n$800 to 5.5 below [that salary], and that the proportion at the present\r\ntime is one appointment above $800 to 6.4 below; and, seeing that this\r\ndifference of proportion represents nearly forty appointments, above\r\n$800, whether he will take steps to readjust that proportion on the\r\nbasis of 1 to 5.5?\"[381] In 1906, Mr. Hay was made a member of the\r\nSelect Committee on Post Office Servants.\r\n\r\nIn April and in August, 1902, Captain Norton asked the Postmaster\r\nGeneral, through the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, to appoint\r\nso many additional senior telegraphists that it should no longer be\r\nnecessary to call on men in the class below to act as substitutes\r\nfor the senior telegraphists who were taking their annual leave of\r\none month.[382] In 1906, Captain Norton became a Junior Lord of the\r\nTreasury in the Sir Campbell-Bannerman Ministry.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1902, Mr. Plummer[383] stated that at Newcastle-on-Tyne\r\nthirty-eight telegraphists, who had, on an average, served 27 years\r\neach, were waiting for promotion. \"Will the Postmaster General\r\nfacilitate promotion by enforcing in the future the Civil Service\r\nRegulation with reference to retirement[384] at the age of sixty\r\nyears?\" Mr. Austen Chamberlain, Financial Secretary to the Treasury,\r\nreplied: \"The Postmaster General would not feel justified in\r\nenforcing the retirement of any efficient officers for the purpose\r\nof accelerating the promotion of others.\" On August 1, 1902, Captain\r\nNorton repeated the request.[385]\r\n\r\nOn November 24, 1902, Mr. O'Brien asked the Postmaster to create more\r\nrapid promotion at Liverpool by retiring all men who had qualified for\r\nthe maximum pension [two-thirds of salary], irrespective of the fitness\r\nof such men to continue to serve.[386]\r\n\r\nOn June 19, 1902, Mr. Keir Hardie asked the Secretary to the Treasury,\r\nas representing the Postmaster General: \"Whether he will state the\r\nspecial qualifications which necessitate the retention in the Postal\r\nservice of the assistant superintendent, Mr. Napper, and the inspector,\r\nMr. Graham, at the West Central District Office, after reaching 60\r\nyears of age; and if the probable date of retirement can be given?\"\r\nOn July 28, 1902, Mr. Keir Hardie asked: \"If he will state what are\r\nthe special qualifications which necessitate the retention of the\r\ninspector, Mr. E. Stamp, at the North Western District Office, after\r\nattaining the age of 60 years; and if he can give the probable date of\r\nthis officer's retirement?\"[387]\r\n\r\nAny officer who is retired with a pension, on account of ill health,\r\nbefore he is sixty years of age, may, if he recovers his health, be\r\nrecalled to duty at the discretion of the head of his Department or of\r\nthe Treasury. Under such circumstances the officer receives the salary\r\nof his new office and so much of his pension as shall be sufficient\r\nto make his total income equal to the original pension. Under the\r\nforegoing rule two officers were made respectively postmaster at\r\nBristol and postmaster at Hastings.\r\n\r\nBefore the Tweedmouth Committee, Mr. Uren, President of the\r\nPostmasters' Association, protested against such \"blocking of some\r\nof the best offices by pensioners.... Here are two good offices,\r\none with $4,000 a year, and the other with $2,750, which are taken\r\nup by pensioners who recover their health, and so block a line of\r\npromotion.... I only mention these as the two most recent cases with\r\nwhich this sort of thing has happened, but they are not the only\r\noccasions by a good many, which I am instructed to bring before your\r\nCommittee as a fair subject for consideration.\" Mr. Crosse, another\r\nwitness, added: \"The Postal Clerks' Association also desire to\r\nendorse the evidence put forward by the Postmasters' Association as\r\nto the anomaly and injustice of certain postmasters being retained\r\nin the service who are in the receipt of pension and salary from the\r\nDepartment.\"[388]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Mechanical Equality Demanded_]\r\n\r\nPrior to August, 1891, the postmen of metropolitan London were divided\r\ninto two classes: the second class, with wages rising from $4.50 a week\r\nto $6, by annual increments of $0.25 a week; and the first class, with\r\nwages rising from $6 a week, to $7.50, by annual increments of $0.25\r\na week. In consequence of the rapid growth of the postal business,\r\nhowever, the postmen frequently passed through the second class into\r\nthe first class, not in six years, but in from two to five years. But\r\nthe rate of promotion from the second class into the first differed\r\nmaterially in the several metropolitan branch offices, because of the\r\nunequal growth of business at those several offices. That inequality of\r\npromotion violated the ideal[389] of the civil servants, which is, that\r\nall should fare alike; and therefore, the postmen demanded that the\r\ndivision into two classes be abolished, and that every postman should\r\nrise, by stated annual increments, from the initial wage of $4.50 to\r\nthe final wage of $7.50. But the abolition of classification would put\r\nan end to the possibility of those rapid passings through the stages\r\nbetween $4.50 and $6 that had been of frequent occurrence in the past\r\nin some of the metropolitan branch offices. By way of compensation for\r\nthe loss of that chance the postmen demanded that the annual increment\r\nbe increased beyond $0.25 a week.\r\n\r\nThe Department, in August, 1891, abolished the classification of the\r\npostmen, but it refused to raise the annual increment. It said that\r\nthe rapid promotion from $4.50 to $6 that had characterized the past\r\nhad been an accident, that it had not been foreseen, and that the men\r\nwho had entered the service while it had obtained had not acquired a\r\nvested right to it. In 1896 the men who had been postmen prior to the\r\nabolition of classification appeared before the Tweedmouth Committee\r\nwith the statement that they \"were under the impression that it was an\r\nofficial principle that no individual should suffer by the introduction\r\nof a new scale of promotion or wages.\" They demanded compensation for\r\nthe fact that they had lost, in 1891, the possibility of passing in\r\nless than the regular time from the wage of $4.50 to that of $6. They\r\nstated that they were prepared to show that \"they had suffered material\r\npecuniary loss ... amounting in some cases to about $500.\"[390] All\r\nof which goes to show that in the British Post Office service the\r\nabolition of a grievance can in turn become a grievance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Equality, not Opportunity_]\r\n\r\nBefore the Tweedmouth Committee appeared also the representatives\r\nof the telegraphers, to demand the abolition of the division of the\r\ntelegraphers into classes, with promotion by merit between the classes.\r\nThey demanded amalgamation into a single class, in which each one\r\nshould pass automatically from the minimum pay to the maximum, provided\r\nhe was not arrested by the efficiency bar, to be placed at $800 a\r\nyear. Mr. E. B. L. Hill, Assistant Secretary, General Post Office,\r\nLondon, began his discussion of this demand by quoting with approval\r\nthe conclusion of the Telegraph Committee of 1893, which was: \"We have\r\ntaken great pains to investigate this matter. Almost without exception\r\nthe provincial postmasters and telegraph superintendents were opposed\r\nto an amalgamation of the classes, and gave the strongest testimony\r\nto the value of the present division [into classes] as a means of\r\ndiscouraging indifference, and encouraging zeal and efficiency. We\r\nthink ... that for purposes of discipline it is desirable to maintain\r\nthe division of the establishment into two classes.\" Mr. Hill continued\r\nby saying that in the course of the last three or four years he had\r\nchanged his opinion, and had come to the conclusion that amalgamation\r\ninto one class must come. \"The staff seems to desire, first of all,\r\nequality, and the abolition of classification seems to insure the\r\nfulfillment of that wish. At the same time classification is a valuable\r\nincentive to exertion and efficiency....\"[391]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Opportunities Rejected; Increased Pay Demanded_]\r\n\r\nIn 1896 the proportion borne by the supervising officers above the rank\r\nof first class sorting clerks to the total staff of sorting clerks\r\nwas 18.85 per cent., whereas the proportion borne by the officers\r\nabove the rank of first class telegraphists to the total staff was\r\n12.59 per cent. At the same time the proportion borne by the first\r\nclass clerks to the total of first and second class clerks was 20.17\r\nper cent. on the postal side of the service, and 24.64 per cent. on\r\nthe telegraph side. In other words, the chances of promotion to a\r\nsupervising position are much better in the postal branch than in the\r\ntelegraph branch; so much so, that to an able and energetic man, the\r\npostal branch is more attractive than the telegraph branch, even though\r\nthe chances of reaching a first class clerkship are somewhat better in\r\nthe telegraph branch than in the postal branch. But the letter sorting\r\nclerk's work is more irksome than the work of the telegraphist, and\r\ntherefore \"the telegraphists are usually reluctant, notwithstanding the\r\nbetter prospects of promotion, to accept work on the postal side.\" For\r\nexample, in the four years ending with 1896, only ten telegraphists at\r\nBirmingham had themselves transferred to the postal side, and three of\r\nthose ten had themselves re-transferred to the instrument room, because\r\nthe work on the postal side proved too hard for them. Again, on March\r\n6, 1896, Mr. Harley, the postmaster at Manchester, issued the following\r\nnotice: \"I should like to afford an opportunity to telegraphists in\r\nthis office of becoming acquainted with letter sorting duties, and,\r\nwith this view, if a sufficient number of officers apply, I will\r\narrange an evening duty of from 2 to 3 hours in the sorting office for\r\na month in every three, such duty to form a portion of their 8 hours'\r\nduty. About 50 officers would be required to enable me to carry this\r\nsuggestion into effect, and I shall be glad if all officers who are\r\ndisposed to avail themselves of this opportunity of acquiring postal\r\nknowledge will submit their names.\" At the end of three weeks Mr.\r\nHarley had not had a single response, though he had in person explained\r\nto a number of \"representative telegraphists the advantage which a\r\nknowledge of postal work would give them.\"\r\n\r\nThe telegraphists, as a body, decline to avail themselves of the\r\nopportunities offered them to improve their chances of promotion; none\r\nthe less they allege they have a grievance in the fact that their\r\nchances of promotion are not so good as are the chances of the sorting\r\nclerks. They demand that the Post Office redress their grievance,\r\neither by increasing the number of telegraph supervising officers, or\r\nby raising the salaries of the first and second class telegraphists\r\nsufficiently to compensate the telegraphists for their smaller chance\r\nof becoming supervising officers.[392]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Parliamentary Intervention_]\r\n\r\nThe telegraphists even try to bring pressure on the Government to stop\r\nthe Post Office from forcing them to learn letter sorting. For example,\r\nin 1896, the Post Office required the telegraphists and sorters\r\nemployed in the Oxford Central Post Office to work at the pleasure of\r\nthe Oxford postmaster at letter sorting or at telegraphing. The Oxford\r\ntelegraph clerks argued that they had contracts with the Government to\r\nwork as telegraph operators, and that the Government had no right to\r\nforce them either to do sorting, or to suffer transfer to some other\r\noffice where the convenience of the Government would not be affected\r\nby their refusal to act as sorters. The clerks kept up their agitation\r\nfor years, and in December, 1902, they induced Mr. Samuel,[393] M. P.,\r\nto champion their cause in the House of Commons.[394] Mr. Samuel, in\r\n1895 and 1900, had contested unsuccessfully South Oxfordshire. He took\r\n\"First Class Honors\" at Oxford, and he has published: _Liberalism,\r\nIts Principles and Purposes_. In 1906, Mr. Samuel became Under Home\r\nSecretary in the Campbell-Bannerman Ministry.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1904, Mr. William Jones asked the Postmaster General:\r\n\"Whether he is aware that for some time past endeavors have been made\r\nto compel the telegraph staff at Oxford to perform postal duties, and\r\nthat they have been informed that they would be removed compulsorily\r\nto other offices in the event of the men declining to perform those\r\nduties; and whether, in view of the declaration of previous Postmasters\r\nGeneral, that telegraphists who had entered the service before 1896\r\nare exempt from the performance of postal work, he will explain the\r\nreasons for his action?\" Lord Stanley, Postmaster General, replied:\r\n\"The telegraph work at Oxford has of late considerably fallen off\r\n[in consequence of the competition from the telephone], and there is\r\nconsequently not sufficient work to keep the officers in the telegraph\r\noffice fully occupied. Their services have therefore been utilized\r\nfor the benefit of the Department in such manner as the exigencies\r\nof the service require. All officers of the Department are expected\r\nloyally to perform any work required of them which they are capable\r\nof undertaking; and unless some means can be found of utilizing\r\nthe services of redundant telegraphists at the offices where they\r\nare at present employed, a transfer to another office is the only\r\nalternative.\"[395] Mr. Jones had sat in Parliament since 1895. He is a\r\nprivate tutor at Oxford; has been assistant schoolmaster at Anglesey;\r\nand has served under the London School Board.[396]\r\n\r\nWithin ten days of the Jones episode, Mr. Dobbie,[397] who had just\r\nbeen sent to Parliament to represent Ayr Burghs, Scotland, intervened\r\non behalf of the Glasgow Post Office clerks, who objected to being\r\ncompelled to do dual duties.[398] At about the same time Mr. Henderson,\r\nwho, before entering Parliament, had been a Member of the Newcastle\r\nTown Council, intervened on behalf of one Chandler, a sorting clerk\r\nand telegraphist at Middlesbrough, who had been informed that his\r\nincrement would be withheld because of his ignorance of telegraphy. The\r\nPostmaster General replied: \"All the circumstances of his case have\r\nalready been examined more than once both by my predecessor and myself,\r\nand I am quite satisfied that he has received proper treatment.\"[399]\r\n\r\nIn October, 1906, Mr. Parker, M. P., intervened on behalf of some\r\ntelegraph clerks at Halifax who were being made to sort letters.[400]\r\n\r\nThe Bradford Committee on Post Office Wages, 1904, reported: \"... it\r\nwas pointed out that in the larger offices promotion is better on the\r\nPostal side.... This is admitted, though we understand that it is open\r\nto any telegraphists to acquire a knowledge of Postal business, and\r\nso qualify for promotion on either side. It is found that this is not\r\ndone, however, as the men prefer the Telegraph work to the more irksome\r\nPostal duties.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Sundry Vested Rights_]\r\n\r\nThe Post Office gives those counter men of London and Dublin who\r\nreceive or pay money over the counter, a risk allowance, for the\r\npurpose of reimbursing them for any errors that they may make in\r\ndealing with the public. No such allowance is given to the postal\r\nclerks in any other city; nor are such allowances paid by railway\r\ncompanies or other private employers. Upon the provincial Post Office\r\nclerks making a demand for equal treatment with the London and Dublin\r\nclerks, the Department decided to discontinue the allowances in London\r\nand Dublin \"as to future entrants to the postal service,\" and under\r\n\"the most sacred preservation of all existing interests.\"[401] The\r\nTweedmouth Committee endorsed this resolution, with the statement that\r\n\"the rights of existing holders of risk allowances should, of course,\r\nin all cases be maintained.\"\r\n\r\nThe Tweedmouth Committee suggested a new scale of pay for the several\r\nkinds of letter sorters in London. That new scale was suggested for two\r\nreasons: for the purpose of discontinuing the complex system of special\r\nallowances that had sprung up; and for the purpose of reducing the pay\r\nof several classes of sorters, the existing scale of payment being too\r\nhigh. The Committee proposed that all existing rights be safeguarded,\r\nsaying: \"Present holders of allowances should enter the [new] scale\r\nof salary at a point equal to their previous salary and allowances\r\ncombined, and wherever the maximum of the present scale together with\r\nthe allowances exceeds the maximum of the new scale, that, but no\r\nfurther excess, should be granted.\"[402]\r\n\r\nThe Tweedmouth Committee also reported: \"We think that the holidays of\r\nthe Dublin and Edinburgh [telegram] tracers should for the future be 14\r\nweek days, the same period as London men performing the same duties,\r\ninstead of 3 weeks as at present, the change as to holidays of course\r\nnot applying to present members of the class.\"[403]\r\n\r\nThe Tweedmouth Committee concluded that the holidays given to the\r\nletter sorters and the telegraphists in London and in the provincial\r\ntowns were excessive. It proposed that the annual vacation of 21 week\r\ndays during the first 5 years of service and of one month after 5 years\r\nof service, be reduced, to respectively 14 week days and 21 week days.\r\nIt added: \"It is not, however, suggested that this change should apply\r\nto those officers already in the service who receive a leave of 3 weeks\r\nduring the first 5 years, nor is it proposed to curtail the leave\r\ngranted to those officers who have already served 5 years, and are,\r\ntherefore, in enjoyment of a month's holiday.\"[404]\r\n\r\nBefore the Royal Commission on Civil Establishments, 1888, Sir\r\nReginald E. Welby, Secretary to the Treasury, testified that throughout\r\nthe Civil Service the Upper Division Clerks had 48 working days'\r\nvacation a year, besides the usual holidays. He said that but for\r\ncustom, which had become \"almost common law,\" there was no reason for\r\ngiving such a \"very liberal\" annual vacation. But he added that any\r\nchange should be made to apply only to future entrants to the public\r\nservice.[405]\r\n\r\nIn 1892 the Department increased from 21 week days, to one calendar\r\nmonth, the annual leave of all men in the Central Post Office, London,\r\nwho were in receipt of $750 a year, or more. In the following year,\r\n1893, the Department gave the same increase to men with $750 a year, or\r\nmore, in the branch offices of Metropolitan London, and in the offices\r\nof the provincial towns. In 1895 the representatives of the men who had\r\nnot obtained the increase of annual leave until 1893, appeared before\r\nthe Tweedmouth Committee with the demand for ten days' pay by way of\r\ncompensation for the fact that, in 1892, they had \"lost ten days.\"[406]\r\n\r\nThe tenacity with which the civil servants resist any change in\r\nthe conditions of service that is to their advantage, is further\r\nillustrated by the following incidents.\r\n\r\nDown to 1880, the overseers in the postal service, who are on their\r\nfeet all day, had one day a week of relief from duty. In 1880 that\r\nallowance was reduced to half a day; and in 1893 it was discontinued\r\naltogether. In each case the change was made to apply only to the\r\nfuture entrants upon the office of overseer. In 1896 the new entrants\r\nupon the office still were complying under protest only with the\r\nrequirement of the Department that they sign a paper stating that they\r\nwere not entitled to any weekly \"relief leave of absence.\"[407]\r\n\r\nThere are four Monday Bank Holidays in the year; and for several\r\nyears prior to 1892, the Telegraph Branch, as an act of grace, gave\r\na Saturday holiday to those \"news distributors\" whose services could\r\nbe spared on the Saturdays preceding Monday Bank Holidays. In 1892 it\r\nceased to be possible to continue this act of grace without employing\r\nmen on over-time, and therefore the practice was discontinued. In\r\n1896 the news distributors complained before the Tweedmouth Committee\r\nthat the withdrawal of \"the days of grace was a grievance with which\r\nthey would like the Committee to grapple.\" The spokesman of the news\r\ndistributors said: \"After having enjoyed the privilege for [several]\r\nyears it was withdrawn, an arbitrary course, almost, it is thought,\r\nwithout precedent. To grant a privilege, and then take it away,\r\ndisplayed a lamentable want of that courtesy that we think should be\r\ninseparable qualities of power and position.\"[408]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Intervention by Members of Parliament_]\r\n\r\nIn June, 1904, Mr. Shackleton[409] intervened in the House of Commons\r\non behalf of some men in the Liverpool Post Office, whose grievance was\r\nthat an interval of 15 minutes, given as \"an act of grace,\" had been\r\nreduced to 10 minutes.[410]\r\n\r\nIn July, 1905, Mr. James O'Connor, M. P. for Wicklow, intervened in a\r\nsimilar matter on behalf of the men at the London West Central District\r\nOffice.[411]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore the Royal Commission on Civil Establishments, 1888, Sir Lyon\r\nPlayfair was asked whether it would not be better to replace by boy\r\nclerks the \"writers\" employed in the past. Sir Lyon replied: \"I think\r\nthat would be better for the civil service and better for the boy\r\nclerks themselves. Of course, regard should be had to the writers\r\nwho are employed now, and the change should be made by not taking\r\non more, and not by dispensing with those that are now employed.\" A\r\nmoment before, Sir Lyon Playfair had been asked: \"The writers are now\r\na very large and very important body in the public service, are they\r\nnot?\" He had replied: \"Yes, and they make you feel their largeness\r\nand importance by Parliamentary pressure.\"[412] Sir Lyon Playfair had\r\nbeen Chairman of the Royal Commission on the Civil Service which had\r\nsat from 1875 to 1876; and he had been the author of the Playfair\r\nReorganization of the civil service in 1876.\r\n\r\nBefore the Committee on Civil Services Expenditure, 1873, Mr. W. E.\r\nBaxter, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, said: ... \"but I may say\r\nat once in regard to the matter of the travelling expenses of county\r\ncourt judges, that I think the whole thing has hitherto been in such\r\nan unsatisfactory state that it would be very difficult to defend the\r\naction of the Treasury in various matters connected with it.\" Thereupon\r\nMr. West, a Member of the Committee, queried: \"Acting in accordance\r\nwith that view last year, the Chancellor of the Exchequer endeavored\r\nto reform the system as to existing judges and as to future judges,\r\ndid he not?... Is that reform being now pursued with regard to the\r\nexisting judges?\" The Financial Secretary to the Treasury replied:\r\n\"Not in regard to existing judges. I have always been of opinion that\r\nit is very difficult to go back upon arrangements which have been made\r\nin the past, however injurious to the public service and uneconomical\r\nthey may have been, and that it would be better for economists [persons\r\ndesiring to effect economy] to direct their attention to preventing\r\nnew arrangements of a similar character.\"[413]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Unbusinesslike Spirit Further Illustrated_]\r\n\r\nThe thoroughly unbusinesslike spirit of the postal employees is\r\nillustrated still further in the following \"grievance\" laid before the\r\nTweedmouth Committee by the official representatives of the postal\r\nemployees, who spoke, not as individuals, but as the instructed\r\nrepresentatives of their respective classes of public servants.\r\n\r\nMr. G. McDonald presented the grievance of the \"news distributors,\"\r\nwho \"are the picked men of the Telegraph Service, chosen on the ground\r\nof exceptional merit.\" He complained that there was not sufficient\r\nopportunity for promotion, since [the automatic] promotion was limited\r\nto postmasterships worth from $1,000 to $1,250 a year, and there were\r\nnot enough postmasterships of that kind. Mr. McDonald admitted that\r\nmen under 35 years \"by competitive examination,\" could rise out of the\r\nclass of News Distributors to surveyors' clerkships; but he argued that\r\nsince such promotion was attained by competitive examination, \"it must\r\nbe credited to the man himself who wins his position, and I therefore\r\nbeg to suggest that it cannot count as promotion in the ordinary\r\nsense.\"[414]\r\n\r\nAnother grievance of the News Distributors was that they were not\r\n\"treated and classed\" as Major Division Clerks, though they were paid\r\non the scale of such clerks. They were compelled to work 48 hours a\r\nweek, whereas Major Division Clerks worked only 39 hours a week.[415]\r\n\r\nMr. Alfred Boulden presented the telegraphists' grievances as to\r\npensions. He demanded that retirement on pension should be optional at\r\nthe age of fifty; and that if a man died in harness, such deduction\r\nas had been made from his salary toward the pension fund, should be\r\npaid to his heir-at-law. Mr. H. C. Fischer, Controller London Central\r\nTelegraph Office, replied that \"optional retirement at 50 years of age\r\nwould result in the more healthy members of the staff retiring at that\r\nage, and seeking other employment to add to their income, leaving the\r\nless healthy and less useful persons to hang on in the service as long\r\nas they could.\"[416]\r\n\r\nMr. A. W. North presented another grievance, namely, that a female\r\ntelegraph clerk can become a female superintendent in 21 years, whereas\r\na male telegraph clerk can reach the corresponding position only after\r\n27 years of service.[417]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Malingerers' Grievance_]\r\n\r\nMr. J R. Lickfold appeared as the representative of the postal\r\nemployees to demand that in the case of an employee having failed to\r\nappear for duty, the Department should accept without any inquiry\r\nwhatever the medical certificate of any physician. At this time it was\r\nthe practice of the Department to doubt the genuineness of the illness\r\nand the _bona fides_ of a medical certificate only in case \"the man had\r\na bad record for frequent short sick absences,\" \"though it was a well\r\nknown fact that private [physicians' as distinguished from departmental\r\nphysicians'] certificates could be obtained for 12 cents without even\r\nthe doctor seeing the patient, but on a mere statement of his symptoms\r\nfrom somebody else.\" In support of this request, Mr. Lickfold, as the\r\ninstructed representative of the postal employees, could make no better\r\nargument than to cite the dismissal, early in 1894, of two railway\r\nPost Office sorters, W---- and J----. In the evidence in rebuttal, Mr.\r\nJ. C. Badcock, Controller London Postal Service, gave the following\r\naccount of the episode in question. W---- and J---- were absent from\r\nduty from January 8 to 11 inclusive. On January 10 they sent in medical\r\ncertificates dated the 8th, but the date of one of the certificates had\r\napparently been changed from the 9th. W----'s landlady testified that\r\nW---- and J---- had returned to W----'s lodgings on the 8th, shortly\r\nafter the departure of the mail train, saying that they had missed\r\nthe mail, but saying nothing of illness. She added that both men had\r\nbeen repeatedly at W----'s lodgings on the 8th and 9th. Both W----\r\nand J---- were absent from their lodgings during the greater part of\r\nthe three days from the 8th to the 10th. The Post Office inspector\r\nfound J---- in bed on the night of the 10th. J---- told him he had\r\nnot seen W---- since the 6th, gave evasive answers, and contradicted\r\nhimself. The inspector also found W---- on the night of the 10th, and\r\ngave an equally unfavorable report upon W----'s answers. On the 11th,\r\nthe Departmental Medical Officer found both men in W----'s room, and\r\nreported there was no reason why both men should not have been on duty\r\nfrom the 8th to the 10th.\r\n\r\nMr. Spencer Walpole, Permanent Secretary of the Post Office and a\r\nMember of the Committee, said to the witness: \"Have you any doubt that\r\nthe Department would not have taken the extreme course of dismissing\r\nany of its servants on the divided opinion of two medical men, if there\r\nhad been no previous cases against them?... These men are described as\r\ndeliberate malingerers?\" The Chairman of the Committee added: \"Do you\r\nnot think it would be wise that before bringing forward a particular\r\ncase of this sort, you should inform yourself thoroughly as to the\r\nnature of the case, and as to the character of the men to whom you\r\nrefer?\"[418]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAvery large portion of the evidence presented before the Tweedmouth\r\nCommittee, which evidence covered upward of a thousand closely printed\r\nfolio pages, affords a melancholy comment upon the theory which is\r\nrapidly spreading from the German Universities over the English\r\nspeaking countries, to wit, that the extension of the functions of the\r\nState to the inclusion of business enterprises automatically creates\r\na public spirit which strengthens the hands of the political leaders\r\nin charge of the State, even to the point of enabling those leaders\r\nto reject the improper demands made upon them by organized bodies of\r\nvoters, and to administer the State's business ventures with an eye\r\nsingle to the welfare of the community as a whole, particularly the\r\nlong-run interest of the taxpayers. The so-called Norfolk-Hanbury\r\ncompromise, the appointment and Report of the Bradford Committee,\r\nand the appointment, in 1906, of the Select Committee on Post Office\r\nServants--the last act not having the support, by speech or by vote,\r\nof a single man of first rate importance in the House of Commons--are\r\nmelancholy instances of what that most discerning of statesmen, the\r\nlate Marquis of Salisbury, used to call \"the visible helplessness of\r\nGovernments.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[363] _Third Report from the Select Committee on Civil Services\r\nExpenditure_, 1873; q. 4,641 and 4,418.\r\n\r\n[364] That is, the claim to additional pay for seven hours' work.\r\n\r\n[365] That is, the Civil Service Inquiry Commission, 1875-76, of which\r\nSir T.

Testimony, in 1902, of\r\n     Lord Welby, who had been in the Treasury from 1856 to 1894.\r\n     Testimony of Sir George H. Murray, Permanent Secretary to the\r\n     Post Office and sometime Private Secretary to the late Prime\r\n     Minister, Mr. Gladstone. Testimony of Sir Ralph H. Knox, in\r\n     the War Office since 1882. Testimony of Sir Edward Hamilton,\r\n     Assistant Secretary to the Treasury since 1894. Testimony of\r\n     Mr. R. Chalmers, a Principal Clerk in the Treasury; and of\r\n     Sir John Eldon Gorst. Mr. Gladstone's tribute to Joseph Hume,\r\n     the first and last Member of the House of Commons competent\r\n     to criticize effectively the details of expenditure of the\r\n     State. Evidence presented before the Select Committee on Civil\r\n     Services Expenditure, 1873.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to the subject proper of this chapter, it is\r\ndesirable to say a word about the organization and the work of the\r\nTreasury.[419]\r\n\r\nThe Treasury consists of the First Lord of the Treasury, who is almost\r\ninvariably the Prime Minister; the Chancellor of the Exchequer; and\r\nthree Junior Lords of the Treasury. \"The Treasury is pre-eminently\r\na superintending and controlling office, and has properly no\r\nadministrative functions.\" Its duty is to reduce to, and maintain at,\r\nthe minimum compatible with efficiency, the expenditures of the several\r\nDepartments of State.\r\n\r\nThe Treasury has three Secretaries: the Financial Secretary, the\r\nParliamentary, or Patronage Secretary, and the Permanent Secretary.\r\nThe Financial Secretary, after the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is the\r\npolitical head and conductor of the Treasury. He is one of the hardest\r\nworked officers of the Government. His duties were well described,\r\nrecently, by Mr. Austen Chamberlain, in the course of a brief sketch\r\nof his official career. Said Mr. Chamberlain: \"From the Admiralty he\r\nwas transferred to the position of Financial Secretary to the Treasury,\r\nwhere, as his chief explained to him, he was in the position of an old\r\npoacher promoted to be gamekeeper, and his first duty was to unlearn\r\nthe habits of five years and save money where previously it had been\r\nhis pleasure to spend it.\" The Parliamentary, or Patronage Secretary\r\nis the principal Government Whip. \"He is a very useful and important\r\nfunctionary. His services are indispensable to the Leader of the House\r\nof Commons in the control of the House and the management of public\r\nbusiness.\" \"It devolves upon him, under the direction of the Leader\r\nof the House, 'to facilitate, by mutual understanding, the conduct\r\nof public business,' and 'the management of the House of Commons, a\r\nposition which requires consummate knowledge of human nature, the most\r\namiable flexibility, and complete self-control.'\" As \"Whipper-in,\" the\r\nParliamentary Secretary is generally assisted by two of the Junior\r\nLords of the Treasury, who are, at the same time, Government Whips.\r\n\"Those useful functionaries are expected to gather the greatest number\r\nof their own party into every division [of the House of Commons], and\r\nby persuasion, promises, explanation, and every available expedient, to\r\nbring their men from all quarters to the aid of the Government upon any\r\nemergency. It is also their business to conciliate the discontented and\r\ndoubtful among the ministerial supporters, and to keep every one, as\r\nfar as possible, in good humor.\" \"An estimate of the importance of the\r\nduties which would naturally devolve upon these functionaries--from the\r\nincreasing interference of the House of Commons in matters of detail,\r\nand the necessity for the continual supervision of some Member of the\r\nGovernment conversant with every description of parliamentary business,\r\nin order to make sure that the business is done in conformity to the\r\nviews entertained by the House--induced Sir Charles Wood,[420] to\r\ndeclare, in 1850, that the reduction of the number of Junior Lords from\r\nfour to three was a very doubtful advantage.\"\r\n\r\nThe Financial Secretary and the Parliamentary Secretary are political\r\nofficers, that is, they sit in the House of Commons, and they change\r\nwith every change in the Government. The Permanent Secretary, on the\r\nother hand, is a non-political officer, or civil servant, who retains\r\noffice through the successive changes of Government, and secures the\r\ncontinuity of the office. He is the official head of the Department,\r\nand of the whole civil service.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing facts make it clear that for the purposes of this present\r\ndiscussion, one can cite no more authoritative personages than the\r\nseveral Secretaries of the Treasury.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Select Committee on National Expenditure, 1902, took a great deal\r\nof evidence on the effect of the intervention of the House of Commons\r\nin the administrative details of the several Departments of State,\r\nparticularly on the impairment of the power of the Treasury to control\r\nthe expenditure of the several Departments.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Lord Welby on Change in Public Opinion_]\r\n\r\nThe most important witness was Lord Welby, who, as Mr. Welby, had\r\nentered the Treasury in 1856; had been Head of the Finance Department\r\nfrom 1871 to 1885; and had been Permanent Secretary from 1885 to 1894.\r\nLord Welby said that in theory the Treasury had full power of control\r\nover the expenditures of the several Departments, but that in practice\r\nthat power of control was limited by the state of public opinion as\r\nreflected in the House of Commons. As soon as the Treasury became aware\r\nthat it had not public opinion at its back, that fact \"would have a\r\ncertain influence on many of its decisions.\" Then again, as soon as\r\nthe other Departments of State became aware that the Treasury was not\r\nsupported by public opinion, the authority of the Treasury over those\r\nDepartments was impaired. \"If an idea gets abroad that the House of\r\nCommons does not care about economy, you will not find your servants\r\neconomical.\" Lord Welby then went on to say that in all the political\r\nparties in the House of Commons, \"the old spirit of economy had been\r\nvery much weakened.\" He put the change of public opinion at about\r\nthe middle of the seventies, or, perhaps, rather later, say, in the\r\neighties. Previous to that change the influence of the Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer had been \"paramount, or very powerful, in the Cabinet.\"\r\nBut with the change in public opinion, \"the effective power of\r\ncontrol in the Chancellor of the Exchequer had been proportionately\r\ndiminished.\" Lord Welby concluded: \"I constantly hear it said now by\r\npeople of great weight that economy is impossible, that you cannot get\r\nthe House of Commons to pay attention [to counsels of economy].... The\r\nmain object [to be striven after], I think, is that there should be\r\nsome correlation both in the minds of the Government of the day and in\r\nthe minds of the House of Commons between resources and expenditure;\r\nI think that ought to exist, but I do not think it does exist at\r\npresent. I see no evidence of it.\"[421]\r\n\r\nMr. Hayes Fisher,[422] a Member of the Committee, and Financial\r\nSecretary to the Treasury, in 1902 to 1903, replied to Lord Welby:\r\n\"But is not the business of the Treasury, and the main business of\r\nthe Treasury, to check that expenditure and keep it within reasonable\r\nbounds, outside of questions of policy?\" Lord Welby replied: \"Quite\r\nso; but might I venture to ask the honorable Member, who occupies one\r\nof the most important posts in the Government, whether he would not be\r\nglad of support in the House of Commons?\" \"Most certainly we should on\r\nmany occasions,\" was the answer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Sir George H. Murray on Change in Public Opinion_]\r\n\r\nSir George H. Murray,[423] Permanent Secretary to the Post Office,\r\nwas called as a witness because \"in the official posts he had held,\r\nparticularly as Private Secretary to the late Prime Minister, Mr.\r\nGladstone, he had had frequent opportunities for observation not only\r\nof the reasons for expenditure, but of the control exercised over it in\r\nParliament.\" He said: ...\r\n\r\n\"But I think the whole attitude of the House itself toward the public\r\nservice and toward expenditure generally, has undergone a very material\r\nchange in the present generation.... Of course, the House to this day,\r\nin the abstract and in theory, is very strongly in favor of economy,\r\nbut I am bound to say that in practice Members, both in their corporate\r\ncapacity and, still more, in their individual capacity, are more\r\ndisposed to use their influence with the Executive Government in order\r\nto increase expenditure than to reduce it.... That is the policy of the\r\nHouse--to spend more money than it did, to criticize expenditure less\r\nclosely than it did, and to urge the Executive Government to increase\r\nexpenditure instead of the reverse.\"[424]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Commons the Champion of Class Interests_]\r\n\r\nSir Ralph H. Knox,[425] who had been in the War Office from 1856 to\r\n1901, and who, for forty years, had listened to the discussions in\r\nParliament of the Estimates of Expenditure, said: ... \"The mass of\r\nspeeches that are made in Supply before the House of Commons, are\r\nspeeches made on behalf of those who have grievances, their friends\r\nor constituents, or those with whom they work, or in whom they are\r\nparticularly interested. If you take speech after speech, you find\r\nthey are simply to the effect: 'we want more'--and they get more....\r\nIn former days there were more Members who were willing to get up with\r\nsome pertinence and some knowledge to criticize those proposals. But\r\nI cannot say there has been any very great tendency in that direction\r\nwhen details are being discussed.... What I want, is [someone] to nip\r\nin the bud, new proposals which are made by Members of Parliament\r\nvery often on behalf of their constituents. A Member, for instance,\r\nrepresents what I should call a labor borough; he gets up and proposes\r\nthat the pay of every man employed in certain [Government] factories\r\nor dockyards should be increased by so much a week, what I want is\r\nsomebody to get up and say: 'That is not the view of the country,\r\nyou must not accept that;' but instead of that the matter goes _sub\r\nsilentio_, and the Government, which is naturally interested in economy\r\nand in keeping the expenditure down, is induced to think if there is\r\nany feeling in the House at all, it is in favor of doubling everybody's\r\npay.\" Sir R. H. Knox said he desired more opposition to unwarranted\r\nproposals, \"because I know what extreme weight is attached to the\r\nspeeches in Supply by the Minister in charge of a Department, and by\r\nthe Department itself; but if they find that there is not a single man\r\ninterested in economy when the details of the Estimates are discussed,\r\nit places them in an exceedingly difficult position.\"[426]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Commons Debates weaken Treasury's Hands_]\r\n\r\nSir Edward Hamilton, Assistant Secretary to the Treasury since 1894,\r\nsaid that the Treasury could depend less than formerly upon the support\r\nof the House of Commons, and that often-times the tendency of the\r\ndebates in the House was to weaken the hands of the Treasury.[427] Sir\r\nEdward Hamilton had entered the Treasury in 1870; had served as Private\r\nSecretary to Mr. Lowe, Chancellor of the Exchequer, in 1872-73; and as\r\nPrivate Secretary to Mr. Gladstone, First Lord of the Treasury, in 1880\r\nto 1885. He had been made successively Principal Clerk of the Finance\r\nDivision in 1885; Assistant Financial Secretary in 1892; and Assistant\r\nSecretary in 1894. In 1902 he was made Permanent Financial Secretary.\r\n\r\nMr. Austen Chamberlain, a member of the Select Committee, asked Mr.\r\nR. Chalmers,[428] a Principal Clerk at the Treasury: \"Is it within\r\nyour experience as an official of the Treasury that Ministers of other\r\nDepartments not infrequently represent, as the reason for allowing\r\nexpenditure, the strong pressure that has been put upon them in the\r\nHouse of Commons?\" \"Yes; I have seen repeated instances of that.\" \"And\r\ntheir inability to resist that pressure for another year?\" \"Yes.\"[429]\r\n\r\nSir John Eldon Gorst, M. P., a man of large experience of the Public\r\nService, said he had no doubt that in all offices there were officers\r\nwho had ceased to have anything to do; and that was particularly\r\ntrue of the Education Department, where there was much reading of\r\nnewspapers, and much literary composition. He had \"even heard of rooms\r\nwhere Ping Pong was played, there being nothing else to do at the\r\nmoment.\" Sir John Eldon Gorst continued: \"The Treasury has power to\r\nmake an inquiry into every Office, it could institute an inquiry to\r\nsee whether the office was or was not economically managed, but so\r\nfar as I know that power never has been exercised. It would be very\r\ndifficult indeed for the Parliamentary Head of a Department to call in\r\nthe Treasury for such an investigation. It would make the Parliamentary\r\nhead extremely unpopular. The only person who, in my opinion, as things\r\nare, can really influence the expenses of an office, is the Civil\r\nService head.... But although the Civil Service head of the office\r\nhas a very great motive to make his office efficient, because his own\r\ncredit and his own future depend on the efficiency of his office, he\r\nhas comparatively little motive for economy. Parliament certainly does\r\nnot thank him; I do not know whether the Treasury thanks him very\r\nmuch; certainly his colleagues do not thank him; ... and the natural\r\ndisposition of a man to let well enough alone renders him reluctant\r\nto take upon himself the extremely ungrateful task of making his\r\noffice, not only an efficient one, but also an economical one. I think\r\nanybody who has any experience of mercantile offices, such as a great\r\ninsurance office, or anything of that kind, would be struck directly\r\nwith the different atmosphere which prevails in a mercantile office\r\nand a Government office.... I have no hesitation in saying that any\r\nlarge insurance company, or any large commercial office of any kind, is\r\nworked far more efficiently and far more economically than the best of\r\nthe Departments of His Majesty's Government.\"[430]\r\n\r\nSir John Eldon Gorst's statement that he knew of no instance of the\r\nTreasury exercising its power of instituting an inquiry conducted by\r\nTreasury officers, into the administration of a Department of State,\r\nrecalls to mind some testimony given by Sir R. E. Welby, Permanent\r\nSecretary to the Treasury, before the Royal Commission on Civil\r\nEstablishments, 1888. Mr. Cleghorn, a Member of that Commission, asked\r\nSir R. E. Welby: \"Is there anybody at the Treasury, for instance, who\r\ncould say to the Board of Trade, or any other particular Department:\r\n'You have too many clerks, you must reduce them by ten?' Is there\r\nanybody at the Treasury with sufficient power and knowledge of the\r\nwork to be in a position to say that, and to take the responsibility\r\nof it?\" Sir R. E. Welby replied: \"No.\" Thereupon Mr. R. W. Hanbury,\r\nanother Member of the Commission, asked: \"There is not?\" Once more the\r\nanswer was: \"No.\"[431]\r\n\r\nAgain, in 1876, before the Select Committee on Post Office Telegraph\r\nDepartments, Mr. Julian Goldsmid, a Member of the Committee, asked Mr.\r\nS. A. Blackwood, Financial Secretary to the Post Office: \"You would not\r\nlike, perhaps, to give the reasons for that enormous overmanning which\r\nexisted in some of the [telegraph] offices [in 1873 to 1875]?\" Mr.\r\nBlackwood replied: \"I am not acquainted with the reasons myself.\"[432]\r\n\r\nSir Ralph H. Knox, in the course of his testimony, had quoted Mr.\r\nBagehot's statement: \"If you want to raise a certain cheer in the\r\nHouse of Commons, make a general panegyric on economy; if you want to\r\ninvite a sure defeat, propose a particular saving.\" He had continued:\r\n\"I should like to add, 'If you want to lose popularity, oppose the\r\nproposals for increase.' There ought to be some Members in the House of\r\nCommons who would undertake that line.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Gladstone's Tribute to Hume_]\r\n\r\nThis wish of Sir Ralph H. Knox recalls to mind the tribute paid,\r\nin 1873, by Mr. Gladstone, to the memory of Joseph Hume, the first\r\nas well as the last Member of the House of Commons to acquire a\r\nknowledge of the expenditures of the Government which was sufficient\r\nto enable the possessor to criticize with intelligence the details\r\nof the expenditures of the Government. Said Mr. Gladstone: ... \"and\r\nin like manner, I believe that Mr. Hume has earned for himself an\r\nhonorable and a prominent place in the history of this country--not by\r\nendeavoring to pledge Parliament to abstract resolutions or general\r\ndeclarations on the subject of economy, but by an indefatigable and\r\nunwearied devotion, by the labor of a life, to obtain complete mastery\r\nof all the details of public expenditure, and by tracking, and I would\r\nalmost say hunting, the Minister in every Department through all these\r\ndetails with a knowledge equal or superior to his own. In this manner,\r\nI do not scruple to say, Mr. Hume did more, not merely to reduce the\r\npublic expenditure as a matter of figures, but to introduce principles\r\nof economy into the management of the administration of public money,\r\nthan all the men who have lived in our time put together. This is the\r\nkind of labor, which, above all things, we want. I do not know whether\r\nmy honorable and learned friend [Mr. Vernon Harcourt], considering his\r\ndistinguished career in his profession, is free to devote himself to\r\nthe public service in the same way as Mr. Hume did. If, however, he is\r\nfree to do so, I would say to him: 'By all means apply yourself to this\r\nvocation. You will find it extremely disagreeable. You will find that\r\nduring your lifetime very little distinction is to be gained in it, but\r\nin the impartiality of history and of posterity you will be judged very\r\nseverely in the scales of absolute justice as regards the merits of\r\npublic men, and you will then obtain your reward.'\"[433]\r\n\r\nThe British public, needless to say, still is waiting for the man,\r\nor men, who shall take upon themselves the invidious but honorable\r\ntask of stemming the tide to extravagant expenditure, which, in Great\r\nBritain, as elsewhere, is the besetting sin of popular government. The\r\nBritish people still are waiting, though, since 1870, they have vastly\r\nincreased the functions of the Government by nationalizing a great\r\nbranch of industry, and therefore are more than ever in need of persons\r\nwho shall emulate the late Joseph Hume.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, let us compare with the testimony given in 1902, the\r\ntestimony given in 1873, before the Select Committee on Civil Services\r\nExpenditure.\r\n\r\nA Member of the Select Committee of 1873 asked Mr. W. E. Baxter,\r\nFinancial Secretary to the Treasury: \"Am I right in thinking that\r\nyou do not agree with the Chancellor of the Exchequer's declaration\r\nwith regard to the Treasury? I asked him this question: 'Then it is a\r\npopular delusion to believe that the Treasury does exercise a direct\r\ncontrol over the expenditure of the Department?' And the Chancellor\r\nreplied: 'I do not know that it is popular, but it is a delusion; I\r\nthink that it would be much more popular that the Treasury should\r\nexercise no control at all.'\" Mr. Baxter replied: \"I think that the\r\nChancellor stated it too broadly, and would, probably, if he had been\r\nSecretary to the Treasury for two or three years, have found that the\r\nTreasury did, in point of fact, go back to some extent over the old\r\nexpenditure as well as try to stop increases.\" A moment before, Mr.\r\nBaxter had said: \"The most unpleasant part, as I find it, of the duty\r\nof the Financial Secretary to the Treasury is to resist the constant\r\npressure brought day by day, and almost hour by hour, by Members of\r\nParliament, in order to increase expenditure by increasing the pay\r\nof individuals, increasing the pay of classes, and granting large\r\ncompensations to individuals or to classes.\" The Chairman of the\r\nCommittee queried: \"And that pressure, which is little known to the\r\npublic, has given you, and your predecessors in office, I presume, a\r\ngreat deal of thought and a great deal of concern?\" Mr. Baxter replied:\r\n\"As I said before, it is the most unpleasant part of my duties, and\r\nit occupies a very great deal of time which probably might be better\r\nspent.\" At this point Mr. Sclater-Booth asked: \"You spoke of the\r\nconstant Parliamentary pressure which has been exercised with a view to\r\nincreasing salaries or compensations, do you allude to proceedings in\r\nParliament as well as private communications, or only to the latter?\"\r\nMr. Baxter replied: \"I did in my answer only allude to private\r\ncommunications by letter and conversation in the House, because that\r\nwas in my mind at the time. But of course my answer might be extended\r\nto those motions in the House which are resisted without effect by\r\nthe Government, and which entail great expenditure upon the country.\"\r\nMr. Herman queried: \"When you speak of the pressure put upon you by\r\nMembers of Parliament for the increase of pay to classes, and the other\r\npoints that you named, I suppose that you mean that it is partly party\r\npressure, and that you are more subject to it at the present time than\r\nyou would be if a Conservative Government were in power?\" Mr. Baxter\r\nreplied: \"In my experience it has very little to do with party; men\r\nfrom all quarters of the House are at me from week to week.\" \"Do you\r\nmean to say that men opposed to you in political principles apply to\r\nyou for that sort of thing now?\" \"Certainly I should wish it to be\r\ndistinctly understood that they do not ask this as a favor; they do\r\nnot ask favors of me. They simply wish me to look into the question of\r\nthe pay of individuals and of classes of individuals, as they put it,\r\nwith a view of benefitting the public service.... In very few instances\r\nsince I have been Financial Secretary to the Treasury have I been\r\nasked by anyone to advance a friend, or to do anything in the shape of\r\na favor. The representations are of this sort: 'Here are a class of\r\npublic officers who are underpaid. We wish you to look into the matter,\r\nand to consider whether or not it would be advantageous to the public\r\nservice that their salary should be increased.' I look into it, and I\r\nsay that I am not at all of that opinion, upon which my friend tells me\r\nthat he will bring the matter before the House, and show us up.\" \"And\r\nthe other evil is one which is rapidly diminishing, and, in fact, is\r\nvery small now, namely, interference in favor of individuals?\" \"Very\r\nsmall indeed.\"\r\n\r\nTo a question from Mr. Rathbone, Mr. Baxter replied: \"I do not think\r\nthat the representations in question have much effect; I only stated\r\nthat the most unpleasant part of my duties was resisting the pressure\r\nbrought to bear in that way.\" Thereupon Mr. Rathbone continued: \"They\r\nmay not have an effect when the Government has a majority of one\r\nhundred or so, or when there is no election impending, but do you\r\nthink they have no effect when, as we have seen in former years for\r\nlong periods, the Government is carried on, whether by one side or the\r\nother, by a very small majority, or when an election is impending?\"\r\nMr. Baxter replied: \"I have no doubt that they have had the effect\r\nin former times in those circumstances.\" \"Do you think they would be\r\nliable to have that effect again if either party should be reduced\r\nto that condition?\" \"It may be so.\" \"Can you suggest any mode of\r\nabating the Parliamentary pressure to which you have alluded, whether\r\nit be exercised by public motions or by private influence?\" The\r\nFinancial Secretary to the Treasury replied: \"No; it is an evil very\r\ndifficult to remedy. I think the better plan would be to inform the\r\nconstituencies on the subject and let them know the practice which\r\nso widely prevails, in order that, if inclined to take the side of\r\neconomy, they may look after their Members of Parliament.\" A moment\r\nlater, Mr. Sclater-Booth asked: \"Do you not think from what you have\r\nseen of the public service, that the Treasury, existing particularly\r\nfor that purpose, is the body which must be permanently relied upon\r\nto keep down expenditure?\" \"Decidedly so.\" \"Even the constituencies\r\ncan scarcely, as a rule, be appealed to in that sense, can they?\" \"No;\r\nI attach very much more importance to the power of the Treasury than\r\neither to the action of the House of Commons, or, I am sorry to say, to\r\nthe voice of the constituencies.\"[434]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[419] The subjoined statements, excepting the quotation from Mr. Austen\r\nChamberlain, are taken from A.

The verdict of the experience of Great Britain\r\nunder the public ownership and operation of the telegraphs is that that\r\ndoctrine is untenable. Instead of purifying politics, public ownership\r\nhas corrupted them. It has given a great impetus to class bribery, a\r\nform of corruption far more insidious than individual bribery. With one\r\nexception, wherever the public ownership of the telegraphs has affected\r\nthe pocket-book interests of any considerable body of voters, the\r\ngood-will of those voters has been gained at the expense of the public\r\npurse. The only exception has been the policy pursued toward the owners\r\nof the telephone patents; and even in that case the policy adopted was\r\nnot dictated by legitimate motives.\r\n\r\nThe nationalization of the telegraphs was initiated with class bribery.\r\nThe telegraph companies had been poor politicians, and had failed to\r\nconciliate the newspaper press by allowing the newspapers to organize\r\ntheir own news bureaux. The Government played the game of politics much\r\nbetter; it gave the newspapers a tariff which its own advisor, Mr.\r\nScudamore, said would prove unprofitable. No subsequent Government has\r\nattempted to abrogate the bargain, though the annual loss to the State\r\nnow is upward of $1,500,000.\r\n\r\nThe promise to extend the telegraphs to every place with a money\r\norder issuing Post Office was given in ignorance of what it would\r\ncost to carry out that promise. But the adherence to the policy until\r\nan anticipated expenditure of $1,500,000 had risen to $8,500,000 was\r\nnothing more nor less than the purchase of votes out of the public\r\npurse. Not until 1873 did the Government abandon the policy that\r\nevery place with a money order issuing Post Office was entitled to\r\ntelegraphic service.\r\n\r\nWhen the House of Commons, in March, 1883, against the protests of the\r\nGovernment passed the resolution which demanded that the tariff on\r\ntelegrams be cut almost in two, the Government should have resigned\r\nrather than carry out the order. The Government's obedience to an order\r\nwhich the Government itself contended would put a heavy burden on the\r\ntaxpayer for four years, was nothing more nor less than the purchase of\r\nParliamentary support out of the public purse. No serious argument had\r\nbeen advanced that the charge of 24 cents for 20 words was excessive.\r\nThe argument of the leader of the movement for reduction, Dr. Cameron,\r\nof Glasgow, was a worthy complement to the argument made in 1868 by Mr.\r\nHunt, Chancellor of the Exchequer, to wit, that telegraphing ought to\r\nbe made so cheap that the illiterate man who could not write a letter\r\nwould send a telegram. Dr. Cameron argued that \"instead of maintaining\r\na price which was prohibitory not only to the working classes but also\r\nto the middle classes, they ought to take every means to encourage\r\ntelegraphy. They ought to educate the rising generation to it; and he\r\nwould suggest to the Government that the composing of telegrams would\r\nform a useful part of the education in our board schools.\"\r\n\r\nParliament after Parliament, and Government after Government has\r\npurchased out of the public purse the good-will of the telegraph\r\nemployees. Organized in huge civil servants' unions, the telegraph\r\nemployees have been permitted to establish the policy that wages and\r\nsalaries shall be fixed in no small degree by the amount of political\r\npressure that the telegraph employees can bring to bear on Members\r\nof the House of Commons. With the rest of the Government employees\r\nthey have been permitted to establish the doctrine that once a man\r\nhas landed himself on the State's pay-roll, he has \"something very\r\nnearly approaching to a freehold of provision for life,\" irrespective\r\nof his fitness and his amenableness to discipline, and no matter what\r\nlabor-saving machines may be invented, or how much business may fall\r\noff. To a considerable degree the State employees have established\r\ntheir demand that promotion be made according to seniority rather\r\nthan merit. In more than one Postmaster General have they instilled\r\n\"a perfect horror of passing anyone over.\" Turning to one part of the\r\nservice, one finds the civil service unions achieving the revocation of\r\nthe promotion of the man denominated \"probably the ablest man in the\r\nSheffield Post Office.\" Turning to another part of the service, one\r\nfinds the Postmaster General, Mr. Raikes, \"for the good of the service\"\r\ntelling an exceptionally able man that \"he can well afford to wait his\r\nturn.\" The civil servants, in the telegraph service and elsewhere,\r\nto a considerable degree have secured to themselves exemption from\r\nthe rigorous discipline to which must submit the people who are in\r\nthe service of private individuals and of companies. Finally, the\r\ncivil servants have been permitted to establish to a greater or a\r\nlesser degree a whole host of demands that are inconsistent with the\r\neconomical conduct of business. Among them may be mentioned the demand\r\nthat the standard of efficiency may not be raised without reimbursement\r\nto those who take the trouble to come up to the new standard; that\r\nif a man enters the service when the proportion of higher officers\r\nto the rank and file is 1 to 10, he has \"an implied contract\" with\r\nthe Government that that proportion shall not be altered to his\r\ndisadvantage though it may be altered to his advantage.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion has compelled the great Political Parties to drop\r\nParty politics with regard to the State employees, and to give them\r\nsecurity of tenure of office. But it permits the State employees to\r\nengage in Party politics towards Members of Parliament. The civil\r\nservice unions watch the speeches and votes of Members of the House of\r\nCommons, and send speakers and campaign workers into the districts of\r\noffending Members. In the election campaigns they ask candidates to\r\npledge themselves to support in Parliament civil servants' demands.\r\nTheir political activities have led Mr. Hanbury, Financial Secretary\r\nto the Treasury in 1895 to 1900, to say: \"We must recognize the fact\r\nthat in this House of Commons, public servants have a Court of Appeal\r\nsuch as exists with regard to no private employee whatever. It is a\r\nCourt of Appeal which exists not only with regard to the grievances of\r\nclasses, and even of individuals, but it is a Court of Appeal which\r\napplies even to the wages and duties of classes and individuals, and\r\nits functions in that respect are only limited by the common sense\r\nof Members, who should exercise caution in bringing forward cases of\r\nindividuals, because, if political influence is brought to bear in\r\nfavor of one individual, the chances are that injury is done to some\r\nother individual.... We have done away with personal and individual\r\nbribery, but there is still a worse form of bribery, and that is when\r\na man asks a candidate [for Parliament] to buy his vote out of the\r\npublic purse.\" The tactics employed by civil servants have led the\r\nlate Postmaster General, Lord Stanley, to apply the terms \"blackmail\"\r\nand \"blood-sucking.\" The conduct of the House of Commons under civil\r\nservice pressure has led Mr. A. J. Balfour, the late Premier, to\r\nexpress grave anxiety concerning the future of Great Britain's civil\r\nservice. It has led Mr. Austen Chamberlain, Representative of the\r\nPostmaster General, to say that Members of both Parties had come to\r\nhim seeking protection from the demands made upon them by the civil\r\nservants. On another occasion it has led Mr. Chamberlain to say: \"In a\r\ngreat administration like this there must be decentralization, and how\r\ndifficult it is to decentralize, either in the Post Office or in the\r\nArmy, when working under constant examination by question and answer in\r\nthis House, no Honorable Member who has not had experience of official\r\nlife can easily realize. But there must be decentralization, because\r\nevery little petty matter cannot be dealt with by the Postmaster\r\nGeneral or the Permanent Secretary to the Post Office. Their attention\r\nshould be reserved in the main for large questions, and I think it is\r\ndeplorable, absolutely deplorable, that so much of their time should\r\nbe occupied, as under the present circumstances it necessarily is\r\noccupied, with matters of very small detail because these matters of\r\ndetail are asked by Honorable Members and because we do not feel an\r\nHonorable Member will accept an answer from anyone but the highest\r\nauthority. I think a third of the time--I am putting it at a low\r\nestimate--of the highest officials in the Post Office is occupied in\r\nanswering questions raised by Members of this House, and in providing\r\nme with information in order that I may be in a position to answer the\r\ninquiries addressed to me\" about matters which \"in any private business\r\nwould be dealt with by the officer on the spot, without appeal or\r\nconsideration unless grievous cause were shown.\"\r\n\r\nThe questions of which Mr. Austen Chamberlain spoke, at one end of the\r\nscale are put on behalf of a man discharged for theft, at the other end\r\nof the scale on behalf of the man who fears he will not be promoted.\r\nThe practice of putting such questions not only leads to deplorable\r\nwaste of executive ability, it also modifies profoundly the entire\r\nadministration of the public service. Lord Welby, the highest authority\r\nin Great Britain, in 1902 testified that it was the function of the\r\nTreasury to hold the various Departments up to efficient and economical\r\nadministration. But that the debates in the Commons not only weakened\r\nthe Treasury's control over the several Departments, but also made the\r\nTreasury lower its standards of efficiency and economy. He added that\r\nin the last twenty or twenty-five years both Parties had lost a great\r\ndeal of \"the old spirit of economy,\" and that at the same time \"the\r\neffective power of control in the Chancellor of the Exchequer had been\r\nproportionately diminished.\" In former times the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer had been \"paramount, or very powerful in the Cabinet.\" Upon\r\nthe same occasion, Sir George H. Murray was called to testify, because\r\n\"in the official posts he had held, particularly as Private Secretary\r\nto the late Prime Minister, Mr. Gladstone, he had had frequent\r\nopportunities for observation not only of the reasons for expenditure,\r\nbut of the control exercised over it in Parliament.\" Sir George H.\r\nMurray said: \"But I think the whole attitude of the House itself toward\r\nthe public service and toward expenditure generally, has undergone a\r\nvery material change in the present generation.... Of course, the House\r\nto this day, in the abstract and in theory, is very strongly in favor\r\nof economy, but I am bound to say that in practice Members, both in\r\ntheir corporate capacity and, still more, in their individual capacity,\r\nare more disposed to use their influence with the Executive Government\r\nin order to increase expenditure than to reduce it.\" Sir John Eldon\r\nGorst testified in 1902: \"But although the Civil Service head of the\r\noffice has a very great motive to make his office efficient, because\r\nhis own credit and his future depend on the efficiency of his office,\r\nhe has comparatively little motive for economy. Parliament certainly\r\ndoes not thank him; and I do not know whether the Treasury thanks\r\nhim very much; certainly his colleagues do not thank him.... I think\r\nanybody who has any experience of mercantile offices, such as a great\r\ninsurance office, or anything of that kind, would be struck directly\r\nwith the different atmosphere which prevails in a mercantile office and\r\na Government office.... I have no hesitation in saying that any large\r\ninsurance company, or any large commercial office of any kind is worked\r\nfar more efficiently and far more economically than the best of the\r\nDepartments of His Majesty's Government.\"\r\n\r\nSir John Eldon Gorst might have added that the Civil Service head of a\r\nDepartment really had only rather moderate power to enforce economy.\r\nBefore the Royal Commission of 1888, Lord Welby [then Sir Welby],\r\nPermanent Secretary to the Treasury, was asked: \"But you would hardly\r\nplead the interference of Members of Parliament as a justification for\r\nnot getting rid of an unworthy servant, would you?\" Lord Welby, who had\r\nbeen in the Treasury since 1856, replied: \"It is not a good reason,\r\nbut as a matter of fact it is powerful. The House of Commons are our\r\nmasters.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the hands of a commercial company, the telegraphs in the United\r\nKingdom would yield a handsome return even upon their present cost to\r\nthe Government. That is proven beyond the possibility of controversy\r\nby the figures presented in the preceding chapters. In the hands\r\nof the State, in the period from 1892-93 to 1905-06, the operating\r\nexpenses alone have exceeded the gross receipts by $1,435,000. If one\r\nexcludes, as not earned by the telegraphs, the $8,552,000 paid the\r\nGovernment by the National Telephone Company in the form of royalties\r\nfor the privilege of conducting the telephone business in competition\r\nwith the State's telegraphs, the excess of operating expenses over\r\ngross receipts will become $9,987,000. That sum, of course, takes no\r\naccount of the large sums required annually to pay the interest and\r\ndepreciation charges upon the capital invested in the telegraph plant.\r\n\r\nOn March 31, 1906, the capital invested in the telegraphs was\r\n$84,812,000. To raise that capital, the Government had sold $54,300,000\r\nof 3 per cent. securities, at an average price of about 92.3; and for\r\nthe rest the Government had drawn upon the current revenue raised by\r\ntaxation. On March 31, 1906, the unearned interest which the Government\r\nhad paid upon the aforesaid $54,300,000 of securities had aggregated\r\n$22,530,000, the equivalent of 26.5 per cent. of the capital invested\r\nin the telegraphs. Upon the $30,500,000 taken from the current revenue,\r\nthe Government never has had any return whatever.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe nationalization of the telegraphs has corrupted British politics\r\nby giving a great impetus to the insidious practice of class bribery.\r\nIt also has placed heavy burdens upon the taxpayers. But that is not\r\nall. The public ownership of the telegraphs has resulted in the State\r\ndeliberately hampering the development of the telephone industry. That\r\nindustry, had the Government let it alone, would have grown to enormous\r\nproportions, promoting the convenience and the prosperity of the\r\nbusiness community, as well as giving employment to tens of thousands\r\nof people. In the year 1906, only one person in each 105 persons in\r\nthe United Kingdom was a subscriber to the telephone; and the total of\r\npersons employed in the telephone industry was only some 20,000. On\r\nJanuary 1, 1907, one person in each 20 persons in the United States was\r\na subscriber to the telephone.\r\n\r\nUnder the telephone policy pursued by the Government, the National\r\nTelephone Company down to the close of the year 1896 for all practical\r\npurposes had no right to erect a pole in a street or lay a wire under a\r\nstreet. As late as 1898, not less than 120,000 miles of the company's\r\ntotal of 140,000 miles of wire were strung from house-top to house-top,\r\nunder private way-leaves which the owners of the houses had the right\r\nto terminate on six months' notice. Inadequate as it was, the progress\r\nmade by the National Telephone Company down to 1898 was a splendid\r\ntribute to British enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe necessarily unsatisfactory service given by the National Telephone\r\nCompany, down to the close of 1898, created a prejudice against\r\nthe use of the telephone which to this day has not been completely\r\novercome. Again, the Government to this day has left the National\r\nTelephone Company in such a position of weakness, that the Company has\r\nbeen unable to brave public opinion to the extent of abolishing the\r\nunlimited user tariff and establishing the measured service tariff\r\nexclusively. On the other hand, it is an admitted fact that the\r\ntelephone cannot be brought into very extensive use except on the basis\r\nof the measured service exclusively.\r\n\r\nThe British Government embarked in the telegraph business, thus putting\r\nitself in the position of a trader. But it refused subsequently to\r\nassume one of the commonest risks to which every trader is exposed, the\r\nliability to have his property impaired in value, if not destroyed, by\r\ninventions and new ways of doing things. In that respect the British\r\nGovernment has pursued the same policy that the British Municipalities\r\nhave pursued. The latter bodies first hampered the spread of the\r\nelectric light, in large part for the purpose of protecting the\r\nmunicipal gas plants; and subsequently they hampered the spread of the\r\nso-called electricity-in-bulk generating companies, which threatened to\r\ndrive out of the field the local municipal electric light plants.\r\n\r\nVery recently the British Government has taken measures to protect its\r\ntelegraphs and its long distance telephone service from competition\r\nfrom wireless telegraphy. It has refused an application for a license\r\nmade by a company that proposed to establish a wireless telegraphy\r\nservice between certain English cities. The refusal was made \"on\r\nthe ground that the installations are designed for the purpose\r\nof establishing exchanges which would be in contravention of the\r\nPostmaster General's ordinary telegraphic monopoly.\" In order to\r\nprotect its property in the submarine cables to France, Belgium,\r\nHolland and Germany, the Government has inserted in the \"model\r\nwireless telegraphy license\" a prohibition of the sending or receiving\r\nof international telegrams, \"either directly or by means of any\r\nintermediate station or stations, whether on shore or on a ship at\r\nsea.\" In short, the commercial use of wireless telegraphy apparatus the\r\nGovernment has limited to communication with vessels.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn one respect the nationalization of the telegraphs has fulfilled the\r\npromises made by the advocates of nationalization. It has increased\r\nenormously the use of the telegraphs. But when the eminent economist,\r\nMr. W. S. Jevons, came to consider what the popularization of the\r\ntelegraphs had cost the taxpayers, he could not refrain from adding\r\nthat a large part of the increased use made of the telegraphs was of\r\nsuch a nature that the State could have no motive for encouraging\r\nit. \"Men have been known to telegraph for a pocket handkerchief,\"\r\nwas his closing comment. Mr. Jevons had been an ardent advocate of\r\nnationalization. Had he lived to witness the corruption of politics\r\nproduced by the public ownership of the telegraphs, his disillusionment\r\nwould have been even more complete.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom whatever viewpoint one examines the outcome of the nationalization\r\nof the telegraphs, one finds invariably that experience proves the\r\nunsoundness of the doctrine that the extension of the functions of\r\nthe State to the inclusion of the conduct of business ventures will\r\npurify politics and make the citizen take a more intelligent as well\r\nas a more active part in public affairs. Class bribery has been the\r\noutcome, wherever the State as the owner of the telegraphs has come\r\nin conflict with the pocket-book interest of the citizen. One reason\r\nhas been that the citizen has not learned to act on the principle of\r\nsubordinating his personal interest to the interest of the community as\r\na whole. Another reason has been that the community as a whole has not\r\nlearned to take the pains to ascertain its interests, and to protect\r\nthem against the illegitimate demands made by classes or sections of\r\nthe community. There is no body of intelligent and disinterested public\r\nopinion to which can appeal for support the Member of Parliament who\r\nis pressed to violate the public interest, but wishes to resist the\r\npressure. The policy of State intervention and State ownership does\r\nnot create automatically that eternal vigilance which is the price not\r\nonly of liberty but also of good government. One may go further, and\r\nsay that the verdict of British experience is that it is more difficult\r\nto safeguard and promote the public interest under the policy of State\r\nintervention than under the policy of _laissez-faire_. Under the degree\r\nof political intelligence and public and private virtue that have\r\nexisted in Great Britain since 1868, no public service company could\r\nhave violated the permanent interests of the people in the way in which\r\nthe National Government and the Municipalities have violated them\r\nsince they have become the respective owners of the telegraphs and the\r\nmunicipal public service industries. No public service company could\r\nhave blocked the progress of a rival in the way in which the Government\r\nhas blocked the progress of the telephone. No combination of capital\r\ncould have exercised such control over Parliament and Government as\r\nthe Association of Municipal Corporations has exercised. Finally, no\r\ncombination of capital could have violated the public interest in such\r\nmanner as the civil service unions have done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abolition terms given to persons reorganized out of service, 262, 263;\r\n    premium on inefficiency, 264\r\n\r\n  Absolute dismissal, Power of, in a public department would increase\r\n    efficiency, 247-48\r\n\r\n  Acland-Hood, Sir A., on election losses to supporters of Conservative\r\n    Ministry, 9;\r\n    on loss of seats and votes, 242, 243\r\n\r\n  Administration, Interference of Members of the House with, 132, 135,\r\n    139-40\r\n\r\n  Administrative acts, How answers to questions about, are framed, 278\r\n\r\n  Allshire, W.
