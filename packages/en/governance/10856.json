The\r\npassions aroused during the struggle, the fierce hate animating the\r\nbreasts of the combatants, the deadly incidents of the strife, which\r\nwithout intermission lasted for nearly two years, and deluged with blood\r\nthe plains and cities of Hindostan, have scarcely a parallel in history.\r\nOn the one side religious fanaticism, when Hindoo and Mohammedan,\r\nrestraining the bitter animosity of their rival creeds, united together\r\nin the attempt to drive out of their common country that race which for\r\none hundred years had dominated and held the overlordship of the greater\r\nportion of India. On the other side, a small band of Englishmen, a\r\nfew thousand white men among millions of Asiatics, stood shoulder to\r\nshoulder, calm, fearless, determined, ready to brave the onslaught of\r\ntheir enemies, to maintain with undiminished lustre the proud deeds of\r\ntheir ancestors, and to a man resolved to conquer or to die.\r\n\r\nWho can recount the numberless acts of heroism, the hairbreadth escapes,\r\nthe anxious days and nights passed by our gallant countrymen, who, few\r\nin number, and isolated from their comrades, stood at bay in different\r\nparts of the land surrounded by hundreds of pitiless miscreants, tigers\r\nin human shape thirsting for their blood? And can pen describe the\r\nnameless horrors of the time--gently nurtured ladies outraged and\r\nslain before the eyes of their husbands, children and helpless infants\r\nslaughtered--a very Golgotha of butchery, as all know who have read of\r\nthe Well of Cawnpore?\r\n\r\nThe first months of the rebellion were a fight for dear life, a constant\r\nstruggle to avert entire annihilation, for to all who were there it\r\nseemed as though no power on earth could save them. But Providence\r\nwilled it otherwise, and after the full extent of the danger was\r\nrealized, gloomy forebodings gave way to stern endeavours. Men arose,\r\ngreat in council and in the field, statesmen and warriors--Lawrence,\r\nMontgomery, Nicholson, Hodson, and many others. The crisis brought to\r\nthe front numbers of daring spirits, full of energy and resource, of\r\nindomitable resolution and courage, men who from the beginning saw the\r\nmagnitude of the task set before them, and with calm judgment faced the\r\ninevitable. These were they who saved our Indian Empire, and who, by the\r\ndirection of their great organized armies, brought those who but a few\r\nyears before had been our mortal enemies to fight cheerfully on our\r\nside, and, carrying to a successful termination the leaguer of Delhi,\r\nstemmed the tide of the rebellion, and broke the backbone of the Mutiny.\r\n\r\nThe interest excited amongst all classes of our countrymen by the events\r\nwhich happened during the momentous crisis of 1857 in India can scarcely\r\nbe appreciated by the present generation. So many years have elapsed\r\nthat all those who held high commands or directed the councils of the\r\nGovernment have long since died, and the young participants in the\r\ncontest who survived its toils and dangers are all now past middle age.\r\nBut the oft-told tale will still bear repetition, and the recital of the\r\nachievements of Englishmen during the great Indian rebellion will fill\r\nthe hearts of their descendants for all time with pride, and incite them\r\nto emulate their actions. In the hour of danger the heart of the nation\r\nis stirred to its profoundest depths, the national honour is at stake,\r\nand that heritage bequeathed to us by our ancestors must at all hazards\r\nbe preserved. Thus it happened in 1857, and the result is well known. So\r\nit may again occur, and with confidence it may be predicted that, as of\r\nyore, Britain's sons will not be found wanting in the hour of trial,\r\nthat, keeping well in mind the glorious traditions of their race, they\r\nwill maintain unsullied the reputation of their forefathers, and add to\r\nthe renown of that Empire on which the sun never sets.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary, in this place, to enter into the causes which led\r\nto the mutiny of the Bengal army. These can be read and studied in the\r\ngraphic pages of Kaye and Malleson. My intention is to give, as far as\r\nin me lies, a truthful account of the events in which I personally bore\r\npart, and which came under my own immediate observation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nFEROZEPORE\r\n\r\n_May 10 to June 13_\r\n\r\nOutbreak at Meerut--Neglect of arsenals--H.M.'s 61st\r\nRegiment--Characteristics of the British troops in India--Outbreak\r\nunexpected--First indication of disaffection--News of the Mutiny at\r\nMeerut--Steps taken at Ferozepore--Wives and families moved to the\r\nbarracks--A party of the 61st Regiment sent into the fort--Proceedings\r\nwithin the fort--45th Regiment of Native Infantry tries to take the\r\nfort--It is repulsed--Criticism of the Brigadier's conduct--His want of\r\ninitiative--The cantonment fired--The damage done--Bells of arms blown\r\nup--The 61st dismissed to barracks--A patrol ordered--State of the\r\ncantonment--Action of the mutineers--Officers quartered in the\r\nbarracks--Grenadiers again on special duty--Indifference displayed by\r\nthe Brigadier--Measures adopted for the safety of the cantonment--Search\r\nfor mess property--Parsimony of the Government--Anxiety in the\r\nPunjab--Loyalty of the Sikhs--Sir John Lawrence's appeal to\r\nthem--Their characteristics--Spread of the Mutiny--Reaction\r\nat Ferozepore--Night-attacks--One in particular--Trial of\r\nprisoners--Sentences--Executions\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nON THE MARCH\r\n\r\n_June 13 to July 1_\r\n\r\nA wing of the 61st ordered to Delhi--The five companies\r\nselected--Readiness displayed by the regiment--On the march--Cholera\r\nappears--I visit an old friend--Badli-ki-Serai--News from Delhi--Entry\r\ninto camp\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nBEFORE DELHI\r\n\r\n_July 1 to September 7_\r\n\r\nA view of Delhi--Vicissitudes of the city--Its defences--defences--The\r\nridge--Position of our camp--Our position--The Goorkhas--Cholera\r\nraging--Heat and flies--Executions--The Metcalfe pickets--A sortie\r\nexpected--expected--Hodson--Bombardment of Metcalfe picket--Enemy\r\nreported moving on Alipore--A force sent after them--The action\r\ndescribed--Forces complimented by Sir Henry Barnard--His death--His\r\nservices--Our meagre armament--Scarcity of ammunition--Amusing\r\nincident--The Metcalfe house--Our bugle-calls in use by the enemy--A\r\nsortie--Ruse by the enemy's cavalry--Gallant conduct of Lieutenant\r\nHills and Major Tombs, Bengal Artillery--Expedition under Brigadier\r\nChamberlain--Chamberlain--Gallant conduct of Brigadier Wm.

out at Meerut on May 10,\r\n1857. Events had happened in the Lower Provinces which foreshadowed the\r\ncoming storm, and one regiment of native infantry had been disbanded;\r\nbut no one, not even those in high authority, had the faintest suspicion\r\nthat our rule in India was imperilled. So strong, indeed, was the\r\nsense of security from present danger that the Government, with almost\r\nculpable neglect, still confided to the care of the native army the\r\nlarge arsenals of Delhi, Ferozepore, and Phillour, in all of which\r\nimmense quantities of ammunition and munitions of war were stored.\r\n\r\nThere was not a single white regiment stationed at Delhi, not even a\r\nEuropean guard, the charge of the arsenal, the largest in Upper India,\r\nbeing entrusted to a few officers and sergeants of artillery. The same\r\nmay be said of Phillour, in the Punjab--a small station, where only\r\nnative troops were quartered. The fort of Ferozepore, near the left bank\r\nof the Sutlej River, was guarded by 100 men detailed from the sepoy\r\nregiments at that cantonment, and, with Phillour, constituted the\r\nonly places from which ammunition could be drawn for the large force,\r\nEuropean and native, guarding the newly-acquired province of the Punjab.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's 61st Regiment of Foot was stationed at Ferozepore in May,\r\n1857. In that corps I held a commission as Lieutenant, and, during the\r\nabsence of my Captain on leave in Kashmir, was in temporary command of\r\nthe Grenadier Company.\r\n\r\nThe regiment at this time mustered nearly 1,000 men, half that number\r\nold and gallant veterans of from ten to twenty years' service. These\r\nhad fought in many Indian campaigns, and on the terrible day of\r\nChillianwalla, in January, 1849, when the Khalsa army rolled back in\r\nutter defeat a portion of Lord Gough's force, had, under the leadership\r\nof Sir Colin Campbell, altered the fortunes of the battle. Advancing\r\nin line under a tremendous cannonade, and without firing a shot, they\r\nmarched as if on parade and in stern silence till within fifty yards\r\nof the Sikh batteries, when, with a shout which struck terror into the\r\nbreasts of their enemies, they charged irresistibly and took the guns.\r\n\r\nIt was to men such as these that, fortunately for the maintenance of our\r\nEmpire in the East, England trusted in the perilous days of 1857. As\r\nof my own regiment, so it may be said of all then quartered in\r\nIndia--sturdy, fine fellows, of good physique, of rare discipline, and\r\ninured to the climate, who, in the words of the Iron Duke, could march\r\nanywhere and fight anything. The army then had not been improved out\r\nof existence; reforms, if such they can be called, were received with\r\nconsiderable disfavour; for what amelioration could be effected in the\r\ndiscipline and steady courage of those who had stormed the heights of\r\nthe Alma, had stood the shock of the Muscovite at Inkerman, and had not\r\ndespaired on the bloody fields of Ferozeshah and Chillianwalla?\r\n\r\nI may be excused if I thus energetically offer my tribute of praise to\r\nthat army, and more especially to that regiment in which I passed my\r\nyoung days. I recall the numberless acts of devotion and courage, the\r\ntender solicitude with which the veterans of the Grenadier Company\r\nlooked after the safety of their youthful commander, during the\r\ncampaigns of 1857; and my pen falters and my eyes grow dim with tears as\r\nmemory brings before me my gallant comrades in the ranks who fell before\r\nDelhi, or lost their lives through disease and exposure.\r\n\r\nI had been absent from my regiment during the whole of 1856, doing duty\r\nat the Murree Convalescent Depot, and rejoined in March of the following\r\nyear. Nothing occurred for the next two months to break the monotony of\r\nlife in an Indian cantonment. Parade in the early morning, rackets and\r\nbilliards during the day, a drive or ride along the Mall in the cool of\r\nthe evening, and the usual mess dinner--these constituted the routine of\r\nour uneventful existence.\r\n\r\nMany of the officers lamented the hard fate which had doomed them to\r\nservice in the East, while the more fortunate regiments had been earning\r\nfame and quick promotion in the Crimea and in the recent Persian\r\ncampaign. We little thought of what was in store for us, or of the\r\nvolcano which was smouldering under our feet.\r\n\r\nThe signs of incipient mutiny in the native army had been confined, up\r\nto this time, to the Presidency of Bengal and to the regiments quartered\r\nthere. With us at Ferozepore there was little, if any, indication of the\r\ncoming outbreak. True it was that some of us noticed sullen looks and\r\nstrange demeanour among the sepoys of the two battalions. They, on\r\noccasions, passed our officers without the customary salute, and, if\r\nmy memory serves, a complaint of this want of respect was forwarded to\r\ntheir Colonels. Our billiard-marker, too, a high-caste Brahmin who had\r\nserved on our side in the Afghan campaigns of 1839-42 in the capacity\r\nof a spy, a man of cunning and intelligence, warned us in unmistakable\r\nterms of the increasing disaffection among the sepoys of Ferozepore, and\r\nstated his opinion that the spirit of mutiny was rife among them. We\r\nlaughed at his fears, and dismissed from our minds all alarm, vaunting\r\nour superiority in arms to the dusky soldiery of Hindostan, and in our\r\nhearts foolishly regarding them with lordly contempt.\r\n\r\nThus passed in the usual quiet the first twelve days of the month of\r\nMay, 1857. The morning of May 13 saw us, as usual, on parade; then,\r\nadjourning to the mess-house, we spent a few hours over breakfast and\r\nbilliards, and before midday separated to pass the heat of the day\r\nreading, lounging, and sleeping at our respective bungalows.\r\n\r\nI occupied a large house some distance from the mess in company with a\r\nfield-officer and the Adjutant of my regiment. The former, about\r\n1 p. m., was summoned by an orderly to attend a meeting at the quarters\r\nof the Brigadier[1] commanding the troops at Ferozepore. We paid no heed\r\nto this incident, as it occurred to us that the Major's advice and\r\nopinion were required on some matter of regimental or other routine.\r\n\r\nVicars and I were in the habit, since the hot weather began, of making\r\nices every afternoon, and had become, from long practice, quite\r\nproficient at the work. At three o'clock we were in the midst of our\r\noccupation, our whole thoughts and energies bent on the accomplishment\r\nof our task. Clad in loose déshabillé, seated on the floor of the\r\nsitting-room, we worked and watched the process of congelation.\r\n\r\nPresently a quick step was heard in the hall, the door was thrown open,\r\nand the Major, rushing in, sank breathless into a chair. The Adjutant\r\nand I jumped up, and in our haste upset the utensils, spilling on the\r\nfloor the contents we had taken so much trouble to prepare. A minute or\r\ntwo passed, and still no word from our friend, who, portly in shape, and\r\nof a plethoric temperament, seemed overcome by some terrible excitement,\r\nand fairly gasped for breath.\r\n\r\n\"What on earth is the matter?\" we asked.\r\n\r\nSlowly, and as though uttered with considerable difficulty, the answer\r\ncame:\r\n\r\n\"All the Europeans in India have been murdered!\"\r\n\r\nNow this was rather a startling announcement, and somewhat premature,\r\nconsidering that we three, at any rate, were in the land of the living,\r\nwith no immediate prospect of coming dissolution. We looked at each\r\nother, at first serious and alarmed, as became the gravity of the\r\nsituation, and utterly unable to comprehend what it all meant. This\r\nphase of the affair, however, did not last long, and soon changed from\r\ngrave to gay. A merry twinkle appeared in Vicars' eyes, to which my own\r\nresponded, and at last, fully alive to the absurdity of the gallant\r\nofficer's remark, our pent-up sense of the ridiculous was fairly\r\nawakened, and we roared with laughter again and again.\r\n\r\nThis unlooked-for result of his dismal communication roused the Major,\r\nwho first rebuked us for our levity, and, after an interval occupied in\r\nthe recovery of his scattered senses, proceeded to acquaint us with the\r\ntrue facts of what had happened at the Brigadier's quarters.\r\n\r\nA despatch by telegraph had arrived that morning from Meerut, the\r\nlargest cantonment in Upper India, stating that the regiment of native\r\nlight cavalry at that place had mutinied in a body on the 10th instant,\r\nand marched for Delhi. This had been followed by a revolt of all the\r\nsepoy infantry and artillery, a rising of the natives in the city, the\r\nbazaars and the surrounding country, who, almost unchecked, had murdered\r\nthe European men and women on whom they could lay their hands, and\r\nbesides, had set fire to and \"looted\" many houses in the station.\r\nFortunately for the safety of the English in India, the miscreants\r\nfailed to cut the telegraph-wires at Meerut till too late, and the news\r\nof the mutiny and outrage was as quickly as possible flashed to every\r\ncantonment in the country.\r\n\r\nThe Brigadier had therefore ordered the commanding and field officers\r\nof the different regiments stationed at Ferozepore to meet him in\r\nconsultation at his quarters. Intelligence so startling as that just\r\nreceived required no small amount of judgment and deliberation in\r\ndealing with the native soldiers at this cantonment, and some time\r\nelapsed before the council decided as to what was best to be done under\r\nthe circumstances.\r\n\r\nFinally it was resolved that a general parade of Her Majesty's 61st Foot\r\nand the battery of European artillery should be held at four o'clock\r\non the lines in front of the barracks of the former corps. The two\r\nregiments of native infantry were to assemble at the same time, and,\r\nwith their English Officers, were ordered to march from their quarters,\r\ntaking separate directions: the 45th to proceed into the country,\r\nleaving the fort of Ferozepore on their right, while the 57th were to\r\nmarch out of cantonments to the left rear of the lines of the European\r\ninfantry. The commanding officers of these regiments were also\r\ninstructed to keep their men, if possible, well in hand, to allow no\r\nstraggling, and to halt in the country until further orders after they\r\nhad proceeded three or four miles. The remaining regiment, the 10th\r\nNative Light Cavalry, for some reason or other was considered staunch\r\n(and as events proved, it remained so for a time), and it was therefore\r\nordained that the troopers should parade mounted and under arms in their\r\nown lines ready for any emergency.\r\n\r\nThus far we learnt from the Major, and Vicars, whose duties as Adjutant\r\nrequired his presence at the barracks at once, donned his uniform, and,\r\nmounting his horse, rode in all haste to give directions for the general\r\nparade.\r\n\r\nShortly before four o'clock the Major and I also left the house and\r\njoined the regiment, which was drawn up in open column of companies in\r\nfront of the lines.\r\n\r\nNotice had previously been sent to the married officers in the station\r\ndirecting them to make immediate arrangements for the transport of their\r\nwives and families to the barracks. This order was obeyed without loss\r\nof time, and before half-past four all the ladies and children in the\r\ncantonment were safe under the protection of our soldiers at the main\r\nguard.\r\n\r\nThe barracks of the European infantry at Ferozepore were distant half\r\na mile from the station, and consisted of ten or twelve large detached\r\nbuildings, one for each company, arranged in echelon, with some thirty\r\npaces between each. In front of these was the parade-ground where\r\nwe were drawn up, and before us an open plain, 300 yards in width,\r\nextending to the entrenched camp, or, as it was generally called, the\r\nfort and arsenal of Ferozepore. The space around the fort was quite\r\nclear, its position being directly opposite the centre of the\r\ncantonment, from which it was separated by some 200 yards.\r\n\r\nFrom our situation on parade we had a direct and unbroken view of\r\nthe localities I have endeavoured to describe, and holding this\r\nvantage-ground, we should be enabled to act as circumstances might\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\nThe regiment wheeled into line more than 900 strong. One hundred men\r\nunder command of a field-officer were then detached, with orders to\r\ndisarm the sepoy guard in the fort, and to remain there on duty pending\r\nany attempt which might probably be made by the two native regiments to\r\ngain forcible possession of the arsenal.\r\n\r\nThe detachment marched off, and we watched our comrades cross the plain,\r\nand enter without molestation the gates of the fort.\r\n\r\nIn anxious expectation we waited for the result, when, after a short\r\ninterval, shots were heard, and we knew that our men had engaged the\r\nsepoy guard. The firing was continuous while it lasted, but soon died\r\naway. A mounted officer then rode out at the gate, and, galloping to\r\nwhere the Colonel was standing, reported that the sepoys, when ordered\r\nto lay down their arms, refused, and that one of them, taking direct aim\r\nat the Major,[2] shot him in the thigh, leaving a dangerous wound. Our\r\nmen then poured a volley into the mutineers, who fired in return, but\r\nfortunately without causing any casualty on our side. Two sepoys had\r\nbeen killed and several wounded, while the remainder, offering no\r\nfurther resistance, were disarmed and made prisoners.\r\n\r\nMeantime the regiment stood under arms in line, and another company was\r\nsent to reinforce the men in the fort.\r\n\r\nAmid great excitement, more especially among the young soldiers, we\r\nwaited to see what would follow when the sepoy battalions marching from\r\ncantonments into the country appeared in sight. Eagerly it was whispered\r\namongst us, \"Will the rascals fight, or remain loyal and obedient to the\r\norders of their officers?\"\r\n\r\nThe evening was drawing on apace, but at last, about six o'clock, the\r\nheads of the columns emerged from the houses and gardens of the station,\r\nthe 45th Native Infantry advancing in almost a direct line to the\r\nfort, while the 57th Native Infantry were inclined to their right, and\r\nfollowed the road leading to the rear of our lines. All eyes were turned\r\non the former regiment, and its movements were ardently scanned.\r\n\r\nCloser and closer they came to the fort, till, when only about fifty\r\npaces distant, the column wavered. We could see the officers rushing\r\nabout among their men, and in another instant the whole mass broke\r\ninto disorder and ran pell-mell in hundreds towards the ditch which\r\nsurrounded the entrenchment.\r\n\r\nThis was of no depth, with sloping sides, and easy to escalade, and in\r\nless time than I take to write it the sepoys, with a shout, jumped into\r\nthe trench, scrambled up the parapet, and disappeared from our sight\r\ninto the enclosure.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before we heard the sound of firing, and shots came in\r\nquick succession, maddening us beyond control, for we thought of our\r\nmen, few in number and scattered over the fort, opposed to some five or\r\nsix hundred of these savages.\r\n\r\nWe had loaded with ball-cartridge soon after forming on parade, and the\r\nmen now grasped their muskets, and cries and murmurs were heard, \"Why\r\ndo we not advance?\" and all this couched in language more forcible than\r\npolite.\r\n\r\nThe order at last was given to fix bayonets, and then came the welcome\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\"The line will advance.\"\r\n\r\nEvery heart thrilled with excitement. All longed to have a brush with\r\nthe mutineers, and help our comrades in the fort who were fighting\r\nagainst such odds.\r\n\r\nTwenty paces only we advanced, and then, by the Brigadier's command, our\r\nColonel[3] gave the order to halt.\r\n\r\nThe men were furious, and could hardly be restrained from marching\r\nforward, when, looking towards the outer side of the fort, we saw some\r\nsepoys on the ramparts, evidently in a state of panic, throw themselves\r\ninto the ditch, and mounting the other side, run helterhelterskelter\r\ninto the country. These were followed by numbers of others, who all made\r\noff as fast as their legs would carry them, and then we heard a true\r\nBritish cheer, our men appeared on the walls shooting at the fugitives,\r\nbayonetting and driving them over the glacis.\r\n\r\nThe fight had continued some twenty minutes, and was pretty severe while\r\nit lasted. A few of our men were more or less hurt, but of the sepoys\r\nmany had been killed and wounded. About 100 also had laid down their\r\narms, and, begging for mercy, were taken prisoners.\r\n\r\nNothing could have been more culpable than the conduct of the Brigadier\r\nin not advancing a portion, at any rate, of my regiment to the fort at\r\nthe time the sepoys broke their ranks and entered the entrenchment. Had\r\nhe done so, it is probable that not one of the mutineers of the 45th\r\nNative Infantry would have escaped, nor would the havoc which afterwards\r\noccurred in the cantonment have taken place. But he was an old East\r\nIndia Company's officer, and had served upwards of forty years in the\r\nnative army, having to the last, like many others at that eventful time,\r\nimplicit confidence in the loyalty of the sepoys. He feared, also, the\r\nresponsibility of letting loose the English soldiery to wreak their\r\nvengeance on the mutineers, knowing too well that, with passions roused\r\nand hearts steeled to pity by the murders and outrages committed at\r\nMeerut, and the late wounding of their field-officer, our men would have\r\ngiven no quarter. The Brigadier was one of the very few officers in high\r\ncommand at the outbreak of the Mutiny who were found wanting in the time\r\nof trial. His, no doubt, was a hard task; but, had he shown the smallest\r\naptitude to meet the crisis, there would have been no difficulty, with\r\nthe ample means at his disposal, in disarming without bloodshed the\r\nwhole native force at Ferozepore, and so crushing the rebellion at that\r\nstation.\r\n\r\nNight came, and we still remained in line under arms without having\r\nmoved a foot from where we were halted. Conjectures were rife as to what\r\nwould next happen. Officers and men were grieved, no less than annoyed,\r\nat the state of inaction in which we had been kept, and an uneasy\r\nfeeling prevailed that during the night the mutinous sepoys, aided by\r\nthe _badmashes_, or bad characters, who swarmed in the bazaars and city\r\nof Ferozepore, would, under cover of the darkness, run riot over the\r\ncantonment, without our being called on to interfere.\r\n\r\nAnd so, unhappily, it came to pass. The native cavalry at about eight\r\no'clock marched down to our lines, and drew up on the right of the\r\nregiment, the European artillery being on our left flank.\r\n\r\nSoon after their arrival the arms were piled and the men fell out of\r\nthe ranks, some to lie down on the ground, others forming in groups and\r\ndiscussing the strange events of the day.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a light was seen in the direction of the cantonment, which\r\nquickly turned into a blaze of fire. What new horror was this? Were our\r\nhouses to be gutted and burnt before our eyes without any attempt to\r\nprevent such outrage?\r\n\r\nThe men, at the first appearance of fire, had sprung to their feet and\r\nalmost involuntarily seized their arms. Surely a detachment would be\r\nsent to clear the cantonment of the incendiaries? Even this was not\r\ndone: the Brigadier was absent, or could not be found, and our Colonel\r\nintimated to some officers who spoke to him on the subject that he could\r\ngive no orders without the chief's consent.\r\n\r\nSo, incredible though it may appear, we stood and watched the fires,\r\nwhich followed each other in quick succession till the whole cantonment\r\nseemed in a blaze, and the flames, darting up in every direction,\r\nlighted up the surrounding country.\r\n\r\nWe could hear distinctly the shouts of the scoundrels, and pictured to\r\nourselves the black wretches holding high carnival among the burning\r\nbuildings and laughing at the white soldiers, who, with arms in their\r\nhands, remained motionless in their own lines.\r\n\r\nThat night more than twenty houses were burnt to the ground. The English\r\nchurch, we afterwards heard, was first fired, then the Roman Catholic\r\nchapel, our mess-house, and nineteen other bungalows. The sepoys, mostly\r\nof the 45th Native Infantry, attended by dozens of _badmashes_, marched\r\nunchallenged through the station with lighted torches fixed on long\r\nbamboo poles, with which they set fire to the thatched roofs of the\r\nvarious houses.\r\n\r\nAll night long we lay by our arms, watching the destruction of our\r\nproperty, and thankful only that the wives and children of our officers\r\nand men were safe under our care, and not exposed to the fury of the\r\nwretches engaged in their fiendish work.\r\n\r\nEven after this long lapse of years, I cannot think of that night\r\nwithout a feeling of shame. Here were 700 men, mostly veterans, of one\r\nof Her Majesty's regiments, doomed to inaction through the blundering\r\nand stupid perverseness of an old sepoy Brigadier. The same unhappy\r\nevents as those I have narrated occurred at the outbreak of the Mutiny\r\nin three other stations in the Bengal Presidency.\r\n\r\nThe commanders would not act against their trusted sepoys, who, as in\r\nour case, plundered, outraged, and destroyed all and everything that\r\ncame in their way.\r\n\r\n_May 14_.--The morning of May 14 dawned, close and hot, not a breath of\r\nwind stirring. The sun rose like a ball of fire, and shortly afterwards\r\nwe were startled by an explosion which shook the earth under our feet,\r\nand sounded like a heavy peal of thunder in the still morning air.\r\nLooking in the direction of the report, we saw on the far right side\r\nof the cantonment a thick black column of smoke shoot up high into the\r\natmosphere. A quarter of an hour passed, and then another detonation\r\nsimilar to the first sounded in our ears on the left rear flank,\r\nfollowed, as before, by a dense cloud of smoke.\r\n\r\nWe said to ourselves: \"Will the arsenal next be blown up?\" In the fort\r\nwas stored an immense quantity of powder and munitions of war, and,\r\nfearing that perhaps some rebel might have found his way in for the\r\npurpose of devoting his life to the destruction of the entrenchment and\r\nthe annihilation of the European guard, we remained anxiously expectant\r\nfor some time.\r\n\r\nNo cause could be assigned for the explosions we had heard, but we\r\nwere informed subsequently that, by the orders of our commander, the\r\nmagazines or bells of arms belonging to the two native regiments had\r\nbeen blown up by a party of sappers in the fear that they might fall\r\ninto the hands of the rebellious sepoys. It was a futile precaution, and\r\na mere waste of ammunition; for nothing could have been easier than to\r\nsend the contents of the magazines under our escort to the arsenal.\r\n\r\nAt eight o'clock we were dismissed to barracks, and left the spot where\r\nwe had stood in line inert and inactive since four o'clock the previous\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nShortly after breakfast I was sent for by the Colonel to the\r\norderly-room, and informed that it was the wish of the Brigadier that I\r\nshould proceed with my company into the cantonments. I was ordered\r\nto make strict search for, and to take prisoner, any sepoys or bad\r\ncharacters that might be lurking about; and to this end I was to\r\npatrol the station from one side to the other. I was also to visit\r\nthe commissariat quarters, disarm the native guard, using force if\r\nnecessary, and secure the treasure chest, which contained some 20,000\r\nrupees.\r\n\r\nIt struck me that this duty might very well have been performed many\r\nhours before. Why had not a company been detailed to patrol the\r\ncantonment the previous evening, or, at any rate, at the first sign of\r\nincendiarism?\r\n\r\nHowever, I started without delay with ninety Grenadiers, and marched\r\nover a great part of the station, extending the company in skirmishing\r\norder whenever we passed through the numerous large gardens, orchards,\r\nand enclosures.\r\n\r\nNot a soul was to be seen, and the place seemed entirely deserted. The\r\nsepoys, after their work of destruction, must have left during the\r\nnight, and were now probably well on their way to Delhi, while the\r\n_badmashes_ who had assisted them had returned quietly to their\r\noccupations in the bazaars of the city.\r\n\r\nThe cantonment presented a complete scene of desolation. The church and\r\nchapel were a heap of burnt-up and smouldering ruins, our mess-house the\r\nsame, and numerous bungalows--former residences of the officers--were\r\nstill on fire. The heat from the burning embers was intense, and as we\r\npassed slowly by we viewed, with anger in our hearts, the lamentable\r\nresults of the timidity and vacillation, the irresolution and culpable\r\nneglect, of one man.\r\n\r\nLastly, we visited the commissariat quarters at the far side of the\r\nstation. Here there was no guard, not even a native in charge. Strange\r\ninconsistency! It turned out that, some hours before our arrival, the\r\nsepoy guard, true in this respect to their trust, had procured a cart,\r\ntaken the treasure to the fort, there handed it over to the officer at\r\nthe gate, and then started for Delhi.\r\n\r\nMy duty was accomplished, and I marched the Grenadiers back to barracks,\r\nthen reported the unsatisfactory result of my mission to the Colonel;\r\nand, thoroughly tired and worn out from want of rest, I threw myself on\r\na bed and slept soundly for some hours.\r\n\r\nWe were told that afternoon that the 57th Native Infantry, who had\r\nmarched to the rear of our barracks the evening before, had remained\r\nquietly in the country during the night without one sepoy showing any\r\nmutinous disposition. In the early morning, without molesting their\r\nEnglish officers, about half the regiment signified their intention of\r\nmarching down-country; while of the rest, some 300 men returned to their\r\nlines at Ferozepore, and on being called upon to do so by the Colonel,\r\nlaid down their arms.\r\n\r\nIt must be recorded to the credit of these regiments that no officer was\r\nhurt by them, or even insulted. The sepoys quietly but firmly announced\r\nthat they released themselves from the service of the East India\r\nCompany, and were about to become enrolled as subjects of the King of\r\nDelhi. Then, in several instances even saluting their officers and\r\nshowing them every mark of respect, they turned their faces to the great\r\nfocus of rebellion, to swell the number of those who were about to fight\r\nagainst us in the Mohammedan capital of Hindostan.\r\n\r\nThe officers of these two corps were more fortunate than their comrades\r\nof other regiments throughout the land, many of whom were shot down by\r\ntheir own sepoys in cold blood under circumstances of signal barbarity.\r\nThey saw their wives and children murdered before their faces, while\r\nthose who escaped the fury of the sepoys wandered in helpless flight\r\nthrough jungles and plains, suffering incredible privations. Some few\r\nthere were who reached a friendly station, or were succoured and hidden\r\nby loyal natives. But the greater number fell by the hands of the\r\nwretches who in these times of outrage and anarchy swarmed out of the\r\nlow quarters of the cities, and swept unchecked over the whole country\r\nin hundreds and thousands.\r\n\r\nThe officers had taken up their quarters in the barracks in one or the\r\ncentre buildings, which was reserved entirely for their use. Here we\r\nendeavoured to make ourselves as comfortable as possible under the\r\ncircumstances, the large apartment serving at once as mess-house\r\nsitting-room and bedroom for us all. The Colonel alone lived apart,\r\nwhile the married ladies and their families for the present occupied the\r\nmain guard bungalow pending arrangements for more suitable quarters.\r\n\r\nThe poor ladies, as was natural, were in a state of great agitation, and\r\nwould not be comforted. We did our best to quiet their fears, telling\r\nthem there was not the slightest danger as regarded their safety; that,\r\neven were we attacked by the rebels, they need have no dread of the\r\nresult, for we were more than a match for double our number of sepoys.\r\nStill, it pained us much to see their distress, and we could only be\r\nthankful that, come what might, they were under the protection of\r\nBritish soldiers.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of May 14, at sunset, I was sitting smoking and chatting\r\nin the barrack-room with some of our officers when, quite unexpectedly,\r\nI was again called to the orderly-room, and directed to march with the\r\nGrenadier company on outlying picket to the left rear of the cantonment,\r\nand close to the lines of the disarmed sepoys. Two guns of the Light\r\nField Battery, under a subaltern, were also placed under my orders, and\r\nI took with me a young ensign to assist me in my duties.\r\n\r\nThe Brigadier said he had received intelligence that an attack by the\r\nmutineers was expected from the direction of Lahore; and I was told to\r\nkeep a sharp lookout, in case the enemy made during the night a flank\r\nmovement on the station. I was also constantly to patrol the lines of\r\nthe native regiments, to confine the sepoys to their huts, and to take\r\nprisoner any who ventured outside.\r\n\r\nThe short Indian twilight was drawing to a close when I arrived on the\r\nground, and, without losing time, I drew up the Grenadiers in line, with\r\nthe two guns a little in advance and on my left flank.\r\n\r\nTwo sentries were posted in front of the guns, two on the right and left\r\nof my small detachment, and two in the rear.\r\n\r\nThe plain extended before us for miles to the horizon, bare and\r\ntreeless, without one intervening obstacle.\r\n\r\nEvening closed and night came on--a night dark as Erebus, though the\r\nstars shone bright and luminous in the heavens. All nature was silent\r\nas the grave, and, save for the tramp of the sentinels and the marching\r\naway and return of the patrolling parties, for hours we heard no sound.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving barracks the picket had loaded the guns with grape and\r\nthe old Brown Bess (there were no rifles in most of the Indian regiments\r\nin those far-off days) with ball-cartridge. I had also ordered the\r\nmen to fix bayonets, and we were thus fully prepared to give a warm\r\nreception to any sepoys who might attack us. The arms were piled, and in\r\nsilence we lay on the ground.\r\n\r\nPresently, about midnight, one of the sentinels in front of the guns\r\nchallenged:\r\n\r\n\"Who comes there?\"\r\n\r\nThere was no answer, and the cry was repeated, the sentry at the same\r\nmoment firing off his musket.\r\n\r\nThe company sprang to their arms, and I called on the sentries in front\r\nto retreat under cover of the guns. Almost simultaneously, and before\r\nthe men could retire, flashes of fire appeared on the plain, and\r\nnumerous shots came whistling over our heads, while, clear and distinct,\r\na cry rang out, and we knew that one of the sentries had been hit. Close\r\nfollowing the first came several straggling shots, but the rascals fired\r\ntoo high, and we had no casualty. I then ordered the men to fire a\r\nvolley, and the artillery officer at the same time swept his front with\r\ngrape from the two guns.\r\n\r\nAfter these discharges all was still, and we strained our eyes in the\r\ndarkness, but could see nothing. Then, taking with me a sergeant and\r\nfour men, I proceeded to where the sentry had made the first challenge.\r\n\r\nWe found the poor fellow lying face downwards on the ground, and raising\r\nhim up, saw that he was quite dead. Slowly and tenderly the body was\r\nborne to the picket, and on examination by the light of a lantern, we\r\ndiscovered that he had received a bullet over the region of the heart,\r\nand that death, therefore, must have been instantaneous. My heart\r\nsickened at the sight; this was my first contact with the horrors of\r\nwar, and the remembrance will remain with me to my dying day.\r\n\r\nThe other sentinel was then questioned, and from him we learnt that,\r\npeering through the darkness when the challenge was first given, he had\r\nseen figures passing in his front across the plain. Soon they halted and\r\nfired, and then disappeared, probably having lain down to escape being\r\nhit by our men. Hearing this, I sent out a small reconnoitring party,\r\nwhich patrolled the plain for some distance. They returned with the\r\nnews that all was quiet, and no human being was to be seen. Two fresh\r\nsentries were placed in front of the guns, and the men lay down as\r\nbefore, fully expecting another attack.\r\n\r\n_May 15_.--All, however, passed off without further incident, and at\r\nsunrise I marched the picket to barracks and reported myself to the\r\nBrigadier. He made no comment on the events of the night, nor did he\r\neven ask for particulars as to the manner of the soldier's death. The\r\nmutineers, he said, were in scattered detachments still, no doubt\r\nprowling about the outskirts of the cantonment and in the neighbouring\r\nvillages, taking advantage of every opportunity to harass and inflict\r\nloss on our soldiers.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward for nearly a month, with the single exception of\r\none encounter with a body of mutineers, which I shall relate hereafter,\r\nno event of importance occurred at Ferozepore.\r\n\r\nThe chief danger had passed from our midst in the flight towards Delhi\r\nof more than half of the two battalions of sepoys, the disarmament of\r\n300 of the 57th, and the imprisonment of those who had been captured\r\nfighting when attempting to take the arsenal.\r\n\r\nEverything being thus comparatively peaceful, with no enemy in the\r\nvicinity, the Brigadier at last woke up to a sense of his duty; and\r\nextraordinary measures were taken by his command for the safety of the\r\ncantonments and lines of Ferozepore.\r\n\r\nIt was ordered that one company should be placed each night on advanced\r\noutlying picket, another on rear picket, and a third to be stationed at\r\nthe main guard to furnish sentries as a cordon round the whole extent\r\nof the barracks. Two companies were to remain constantly in the fort in\r\ncharge of a senior Captain, so that, out of the ten companies, six were\r\nalways on duty.\r\n\r\nUnder the excitement which first prevailed, and the necessity of being\r\nprepared in case of a night attack from the roving bands of rebellious\r\nsoldiery who from all directions were making for the imperial city,\r\nplundering and ravaging on the route, this duty was cheerfully\r\nundertaken. But as time went by, and week succeeded week, without a\r\nshot being fired to relieve the monotony of our lives, the work became\r\nirksome in the extreme.\r\n\r\nThe regiment therefore fell into a regular groove of guard and picket\r\nduty. We longed to have a fight with the enemy, and still were doomed to\r\nremain in a state of masterly inactivity. At the fort the work was most\r\ntrying, and resolved itself into a course of manual labour. There it was\r\nordered that under the ammunition sheds deep pits were to be dug in the\r\nground. This duty was performed entirely by the English soldiers, and\r\ncontinued for a fortnight in the hottest season of the year. In the\r\nreceptacles thus formed all the barrels of powder, as well as the small\r\narms, ammunition, etc., were packed and stowed away, the whole being\r\ncovered with earth to the depth of several feet. This was a very needful\r\nexpedient, for a stray spark might have blown up the vast stores of\r\nmunitions of war, without which it would have been impossible to carry\r\non future operations against the enemy. No fires for any purpose were\r\npermitted in the fort, and, greatest deprivation of all, the men were\r\nnot allowed to smoke during the twenty-four hours they were on guard.\r\n\r\nThree or four days after the outbreak, and when everything seemed quiet\r\nin and around the cantonment, two officers and myself, taking with us\r\nsome native labourers carrying spades and shovels, proceeded, under\r\norders from our Colonel, to search for the silver plate buried under\r\nthe ruins of our mess-house. We found the brick walls standing; but all\r\ninside the building was one mass of ashes and still-smouldering embers.\r\n\r\nWe knew the locality of the plate chest, and, setting the coolies to\r\nwork, after infinite labour, which lasted some hours, we succeeded in\r\nremoving a vast heap of cinders, and found portions of the silver. A\r\nlittle lower down we came on more; and here were seen spoons melted\r\nalmost out of shape by fire. The large silver dishes, plates and\r\ncups--many of the latter of priceless value, for they had been acquired\r\nby the regiment during the Peninsular War--were lying one on top of the\r\nother just as they had been placed in the chest, but all ruined and\r\ndisfigured, half melted and blackened from the intense heat.\r\n\r\nClose by, where they had fallen off a table, were the four massive\r\nsilver candelabra, the gift of distinguished officers who had formerly\r\nserved in the corps. These were twisted out of all shape, and beyond\r\nhope of repair, of no value but for the bullion. Other articles there\r\nwere, such as snuff-boxes, drinking-horns, and table ornaments; not one\r\nsingle piece of silver had escaped the action of the fire.\r\n\r\nIt was a sorry sight to look on the total destruction of our beautiful\r\nmess furniture. Costly goods had been sacrificed which no money could\r\nreplace; not one single article belonging to the officers had been\r\nsaved.\r\n\r\nGathering together all the silver we could find, and lamenting the\r\nincompetence by which we had lost property amounting in value to £2,000,\r\nwe placed everything in a cart and conveyed it to the barracks.\r\n\r\nMany months afterwards the Government directed a committee of officers\r\nto value the effects destroyed by the mutineers, to the end that\r\nremuneration might be granted to the regiment for loss sustained. This\r\ncommittee, after due consideration, placed the estimate at a very low\r\nfigure--viz., £1,500. The parsimony of those in power refused us\r\nfull payment of this just debt, intimated also that the demand was\r\nexorbitant, and closed all further action in the matter by sending us a\r\ndraft on the Treasury for half the amount claimed.\r\n\r\nFor the first week or ten days after the outbreak at Ferozepore we knew\r\nvery little of what was occurring down-country, as well as throughout\r\nthe Punjab, the province of the \"Five Rivers\" to our north. In that\r\nnewly-acquired territory there were twenty-six regiments of the native\r\narmy, while the Sikhs, the warlike people who inhabited the land, had\r\nmet us in deadly conflict only nine years before. From the latter, then,\r\nas well as from the sepoys, there was cause for great anxiety. Every\r\nprecaution, therefore, was necessary to guard the Ferozepore Arsenal,\r\nthe largest, next to Delhi, in Upper India. The temper of the Sikhs\r\nwas uncertain; no one could foretell which side they would take in the\r\ncoming struggle. Our Empire in Hindostan--during the month of May more\r\nespecially--trembled in the balance. There was infinite cause for alarm\r\nfor months afterwards even to the Fall of Delhi; but at no time were we\r\nin such a strait as at that period when the loyalty or defection of the\r\nSikh regiments and people was an open question.\r\n\r\nThe genius of Sir John Lawrence, the Chief Commissioner of the Punjab,\r\nwarded off the danger. That eminent man, the saviour of India, issued a\r\nproclamation calling on the Sikhs to aid us in our trouble. They came\r\nat once in hundreds--nay, thousands--to enlist on our side. Veterans of\r\nRunjeet Singh's Khalsa army, the men who had withstood us on equal terms\r\nin many sanguinary battles, animated by intense hatred of the Poorbeah\r\nsepoy, enrolled themselves in the ranks of the British army, and fought\r\nfaithfully for us to the end of the war. Their help was our safety;\r\nwithout these soldiers, and the assistance rendered by their chieftains,\r\nDelhi could never have been taken; while, on the other hand, had they\r\nrisen and cast in their lot with the mutinous sepoys, no power on earth\r\ncould have saved us from total annihilation.\r\n\r\nThe Sikhs are the beau-ideal of soldiers. Tall and erect in bearing,\r\nwiry and well-knit, and of great muscular development, their whole\r\nappearance stamps them as men who look upon themselves as \"lords of the\r\nsoil,\" whom it would be difficult to conquer. And without doubt the\r\ncampaigns of 1845-46 and 1848-49 were the hardest in which we had been\r\nengaged in India.\r\n\r\nFor 100 years they had dominated the land of the Five Rivers. Ever eager\r\nfor war, their turbulent spirits gave them no rest. It had been a belief\r\nthat they would in the future acquire the sovereignty of Hindostan, and\r\nI know for certain that among the soldiers for many years there had been\r\na tradition that one day they would sack the imperial city of Delhi.\r\n\r\nThe latter expectation was in a manner fulfilled; but not as an\r\nindependent nation or under their own leaders did they capture and\r\nplunder the Mohammedan capital: they accomplished that feat as loyal\r\nsubjects of the British Crown.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then news reached us of the spread of the Mutiny, till\r\nfrom Calcutta to Peshawar there were few stations where the native\r\ntroops had not joined in the rebellion. Cavalry, infantry, and\r\nartillery, all had risen in revolt. The wave of mutiny was surging to\r\nand fro throughout the land, and as yet little had been done to stem the\r\ntide. True, a small force was being assembled at Umballah, which, under\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief, was about to march to Delhi, but of the doings\r\nof that army we could learn no satisfactory tidings.\r\n\r\nThe closing days of the month of May passed wearily by, and time hung\r\nheavily on our hands. We felt the inevitable reaction from the first few\r\ndays of excitement, and also missed the comforts and ease to which we\r\nhad been accustomed in former hot seasons. The barracks were close and\r\nstuffy, and the officers, in place of the luxury of their bungalows and\r\ntheir pleasant mess, had to endure privations of every kind.\r\n\r\nHot winds, parching up the already arid ground, blew fiercely every\r\nday. At sunset the breeze usually died away; and though the temperature\r\nlessened somewhat in degree, we felt a choking sensation from the\r\neffects of the dry, still atmosphere. No officer slept in the\r\nbarrack-room; our servants carried the beds outside, and there, lying\r\ndown and gasping for breath, we vainly courted the sleep that would not\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, a humorous side to this desolate picture, which\r\nI must now relate, as it shows that, notwithstanding the state of\r\ndejection to which we had been reduced, there still lurked a spirit of\r\nfun and mischief among the officers.\r\n\r\nFor some time after the revolt we had \"night-attacks\" on the brain.\r\nNothing was spoken of but the chance of our lines being assaulted by\r\nwandering bodies of mutinous sepoys. The order-book each evening,\r\nreminding us of the danger, inculcated strict vigilance on picket and\r\non guard. So long did this last without any attack being made that the\r\nshadowy expectation of what never occurred became our bugbear, a chimera\r\nwhich haunted us night and day.\r\n\r\nAt last, in a happy hour, it entered into the mind of one of our young\r\nLieutenants, an Irishman, imbued with the spirit of fun, and the\r\njolliest fellow in the regiment, that this illusion under which we were\r\nall labouring might be made the subject for a frolic.\r\n\r\nHe communicated his ideas to myself and some others of the junior\r\nofficers, and it was then and there decided that, as the sepoys would\r\nnot attack us, we would create a little excitement and diversion by\r\nplaying for the nonce the role of mutineers.\r\n\r\nThe council of war then agreed unanimously that an assault was to be\r\nmade on the remaining officers when asleep outside the barracks, and\r\nthat the weapons to be used should be bolsters and pillows.\r\n\r\nA certain night was fixed on for the accomplishment of our purpose, and\r\nthe signal for the attack was to be given by the originator of the plot,\r\nwho would take upon himself to make sure that the enemy were off their\r\nguard, wrapped in the arms of Morpheus.\r\n\r\nEverything had been arranged to our satisfaction, and the eventful night\r\ncame. At ten o'clock lights were put out, and the assaulting party,\r\nconsisting of six stalwart young subalterns, lay down on their beds\r\noutside the barracks, ranged here and there among those who were to play\r\nthe part of the enemy, and waited for the signal from our commander.\r\n\r\nOur opponents seemed to take an unconscionable long time in going to\r\nsleep, but at length, in the small hours of the morning, when all was\r\nquiet, the \"alarm\" was sounded in a low whistle.\r\n\r\nJumping up from our beds, each man armed himself with a bolster. In\r\nstern and solemn silence our force was marshalled for the attack, and\r\nthen, without any word of warning, each one began belabouring with all\r\nhis might the recumbent figures of the foe.\r\n\r\nStartled out of their sleep, and in a half-dreamy state of\r\nunconsciousness, it may be imagined with what strange feelings they\r\nreceived this assault. Some, more especially the older officers (for\r\nin our zeal we spared no one), seemed perfectly bewildered, and in the\r\nmidst of the shower of blows which rained on them without intermission\r\nvowed vengeance and threatened to put us under arrest. We answered them\r\nthat this was a \"night-attack,\" and they must prepare for defence, as no\r\nquarter would be given.\r\n\r\nEven the fat and portly Major, notwithstanding his rank, felt the\r\nstrength of our arms, and, almost bereft of breath between each blow,\r\ncommanded us to desist. He might as well have spoken to the winds: our\r\nblood was up, and the spirit of fun had taken possession, so that I\r\nverily believe, had the Colonel or Brigadier been lying there, neither\r\nof them would have escaped our onslaught.\r\n\r\nThe enemy were now fully aroused, and, not relishing the fun of being\r\nbuffeted unmercifully in their beds without resistance, they one and all\r\nturned out and, seizing their pillows, joined in the fight. The attack,\r\nbegun with tactical judgment, turned now into a confused mêlée. Friend\r\nand foe were mixed up in one grand shindy, and for many minutes the\r\nbattle continued without intermission. Blows fell fast and thick; there\r\nwas a rushing about of half-clad figures swaying bolsters, and each one\r\nintent on the same object--namely, that of overcoming his antagonist for\r\nthe time being. So weird, and yet so utterly ludicrous a sight, surely\r\nnever has been seen before or since in India.\r\n\r\nAt length, from sheer exhaustion, the combat came to an end, and,\r\nsitting on our beds panting from fatigue, and overcome by the heat of\r\nthe night, we discussed the incidents of the fight. Some of the senior\r\nofficers seemed at first inclined to treat the attack as something more\r\nthan a joke, and threatened to report us to the Colonel. We pointed out\r\nto them that such a proceeding would be absurd, for had they not also\r\ncompromised themselves by joining in the fray? It was not long, however,\r\nbefore they were struck with the grand ridiculousness of this very\r\nstrange episode; and the question at issue, as may naturally be\r\nsupposed, ended in laughter. Peace being restored, we wished each other\r\ngood-night, and, thoroughly worn out by our exertions, all slept soundly\r\ntill break of day.\r\n\r\nThe affair was kept quiet as far as possible, but gradually got noised\r\nabroad among other regiments of Her Majesty's infantry. Great amusement\r\nwas caused by the recital, nor for a long period afterwards was the\r\ncomical \"night-attack\" at Ferozepore forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe trial of the sepoys who had been taken prisoners when resisting\r\nthe detachment sent to disarm them in the fort, and of those also who\r\nattacked the arsenal on May 13, had been proceeding for some time. It\r\nwas a general court-martial composed of thirteen officers, presided over\r\nby a Lieutenant-Colonel. Of the prisoners taken, some 100 were singled\r\nout as the ringleaders, the rest being put back for trial till a future\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nThe evidence was most clear as to the heinous offences of mutiny and\r\nrebellion with regard to all these men, and they were accordingly found\r\nguilty. Sentence was at once pronounced on fourteen of the sepoys, and\r\nthe punishment was death.\r\n\r\nTwo men of low caste were to be hanged, while the remaining twelve,\r\ncomprising Mohammedans and high-caste Hindoos, were to expiate their\r\ncrime by that most awful and ghastly penalty, execution by being blown\r\nto pieces from the mouths of cannons.\r\n\r\nThis terrible punishment had been but seldom inflicted during British\r\nrule in India, the last instance occurring in 1825, when a native\r\nregiment mutinied and refused to cross the sea to take part in the first\r\nBurmese War.\r\n\r\nNeither was it from the English that this special death penalty\r\noriginated. It had been for hundreds of years the recognized punishment\r\nfor mutiny and rebellion throughout Hindostan, and in numberless cases\r\nwas carried out by the Mogul Emperors.\r\n\r\nWith us at this period it was found necessary to strike terror into the\r\nhearts of the rebels, to prove to them that we were resolved at all\r\nhazards to crush the revolt, and to give warning that to those who were\r\ntaken fighting against us no mercy would be shown.\r\n\r\nOn religious grounds also the infliction of the death penalty by blowing\r\naway mutineers at the mouths of cannons was dreaded both by the Hindoos\r\nand Mohammedans.\r\n\r\nThe Hindoo, unless the corpse after death is burnt to ashes with all\r\nceremony, or else consigned to the sacred stream of the Ganges,\r\ncannot partake of the glories of the future state, nor dwell in bliss\r\neverlasting with the gods of his mythology.\r\n\r\nSo with the Mohammedan, the Koran enjoins that all true believers\r\nmust be buried with the body in the natural state, and only those are\r\nexempted who have lost limbs in fighting against the infidel. The joys\r\nof Paradise, where ever-young and beautiful houris minister to the wants\r\nand pleasures of the faithful, were therefore not for those who met\r\na shameful death and were denied or unable to obtain burial in the\r\northodox manner.\r\n\r\nThus, it will be seen, the terrors of future shame and dishonour\r\nresulted to both Hindoo and Mohammedan by the death we were about to\r\ninflict on them; and it was for the awe inspired by the punishment that\r\nthe military authorities at this time thought proper to carry it out in\r\nthis unaccustomed manner.\r\n\r\n_June 13_.--The morning of June 13 was fixed upon for the execution. A\r\ngallows was erected on the plain to the north side of the fort, facing\r\nthe native bazaars, and at a distance of some 300 yards. On this two\r\nsepoys were to be hanged, and at the same time their comrades in mutiny\r\nwere to be blown away from guns.\r\n\r\nWe paraded at daylight every man off duty, and, with the band playing,\r\nmarched to the place of execution, and drew up in line near the gallows\r\nand opposite the native quarter.\r\n\r\nShortly after our arrival the European Light Field Battery, of six guns,\r\nappeared on the scene, forming up on our left flank, and about twenty\r\nyards in front of the Light Company.\r\n\r\nThe morning was close and sultry, not a cloud in the sky, and not a\r\nbreath of wind stirring; and I confess I felt sick with a suffocating\r\nsense of horror when I reflected on the terrible sight I was about to\r\nwitness.\r\n\r\nSoon the fourteen mutineers, under a strong escort of our men with fixed\r\nbayonets, were seen moving from the fort. They advanced over the plain\r\nat our rear, and drew up to the left front of, and at right angles to,\r\nthe battery of artillery.\r\n\r\nI was standing at the extreme right of the line with the Grenadier\r\nCompany, and some distance from the guns; but I had provided myself with\r\na pair of strong glasses, and therefore saw all that followed clearly\r\nand distinctly.\r\n\r\nThere was no unnecessary delay in the accomplishment of the tragedy. Two\r\nof the wretched creatures were marched off to the gallows, and placed\r\nwith ropes round their necks on a raised platform under the beam.\r\n\r\nThe order was given for the guns to be loaded, and quick as thought the\r\nEuropean artillerymen placed a quarter charge of powder in each piece.\r\nThe guns were 9-pounders, the muzzles standing about 3 feet from the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nDuring these awful preparations, I watched at intervals the faces of the\r\ncondemned men, but could detect no traces of fear or agitation in their\r\ndemeanour. The twelve stood two deep, six in front and six in the rear,\r\ncalm and undismayed, without uttering a word.\r\n\r\nAn officer came forward, and, by the Brigadier's order, read the\r\nsentence of the court-martial, and at its conclusion the six men in\r\nfront, under escort, walked towards the battery.\r\n\r\nThere was a death-like silence over the scene at this time, and,\r\novercome with horror, my heart seemed almost to cease beating.\r\n\r\nArrived at the guns, the culprits were handed over to the artillerymen,\r\nwho, ready prepared with strong ropes in their hands, seized their\r\nvictims. Each of these, standing erect, was bound to a cannon and\r\ntightly secured, with the small of the back covering the muzzle. And\r\nthen all at once the silence which reigned around was broken by the\r\noaths and yells of those about to die. These sounds were not uttered by\r\nmen afraid of death, for they showed the most stoical indifference,\r\nbut were the long-suppressed utterances of dying souls, who, in the\r\nbitterness of their hearts, cursed those who had been instrumental\r\nin condemning them to this shameful end. They one and all poured out\r\nmaledictions on our heads; and in their language, one most rich in\r\nexpletives, they exhausted the whole vocabulary.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the gunners stood with lighted port-fires, waiting for the\r\nword of command to fire the guns and launch the sepoys into eternity.\r\n\r\nThese were still yelling and raining abuse, some even looking over their\r\nshoulders and watching without emotion the port-fires, about to be\r\napplied to the touch-holes, when the word \"Fire!\" sounded from the\r\nofficer in command, and part of the tragedy was at an end.\r\n\r\nA thick cloud of smoke issued from the muzzles of the cannons, through\r\nwhich were distinctly seen by several of us the black heads of the\r\nvictims, thrown many feet into the air.\r\n\r\nWhile this tragic drama was enacting, the two sepoys to be hanged were\r\nturned off the platform.\r\n\r\nThe artillerymen again loaded the guns, the six remaining prisoners,\r\ncursing like their comrades, were bound to them, another discharge, and\r\nthen an execution, the like of which I hope never to see again, was\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nAll this time a sickening, offensive smell pervaded the air, a stench\r\nwhich only those who have been present at scenes such as these can\r\nrealize--the pungent odour of burnt human flesh.\r\n\r\nThe artillerymen had neglected putting up back-boards to their guns, so\r\nthat, horrible to relate, at each discharge the recoil threw back pieces\r\nof burning flesh, bespattering the men and covering them with blood and\r\ncalcined remains.\r\n\r\nA large concourse of natives from the bazaars and city had assembled in\r\nfront of the houses, facing the guns at a distance, as I said before, of\r\nsome 300 yards, to watch the execution. At the second discharge of the\r\ncannon, and on looking before me, I noticed the ground torn up and earth\r\nthrown a slight distance into the air more than 200 paces away. Almost\r\nat the same time there was a commotion among the throng in front, some\r\nrunning to and fro, while others ran off in the direction of the houses.\r\nI called the attention of an officer who was standing by my side to this\r\nstrange and unaccountable phenomenon, and said, half joking: \"Surely the\r\nscattered limbs of the sepoys have not been carried so far?\"\r\n\r\nHe agreed with me that such was impossible; but how to account for the\r\nsight we had seen was quite beyond our comprehension.\r\n\r\nThe drama came to an end about six o'clock, and as is usual, even after\r\na funeral or a military execution, the band struck up an air, and we\r\nmarched back to barracks, hoping soon to drive from our minds the\r\nrecollection of the awful scenes we had witnessed.\r\n\r\nTwo or three hours after our return news arrived that one native had\r\nbeen killed and two wounded among the crowd which had stood in our\r\nfront, spectators of the recent execution. How this happened has\r\nnever been explained. At this time a \"cantonment guard\" was mounted,\r\nconsisting of a company of European infantry, half a troop of the 10th\r\nLight Cavalry, and four guns, and two of these guns loaded with grape\r\nwere kept ready during the night, the horses being harnessed, etc.\r\nHalf the cavalry also was held in readiness, saddled; in fact, every\r\nprecaution was taken to meet an attack.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can recollect, there were but two executions by blowing away\r\nfrom guns on any large scale by us during the Mutiny; one of them that\r\nat Ferozepore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plan of the Military Station at FEROZEPORE]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Brigadier-General Innes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Major Redmond.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Colonel William Jones, C.B.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nON THE MARCH\r\n\r\nAfter the excitement of the late executions we were prepared to relapse\r\ninto our usual state of inaction and monotony, when, on the morning\r\nof June 13, a courier arrived from Lahore, the headquarters of the\r\nExecutive Government of the Punjab. He brought instructions and orders\r\nfrom Sir John Lawrence to the Brigadier commanding at Ferozepore to the\r\neffect that a wing of Her Majesty's 61st Regiment was to proceed at once\r\nto reinforce the army under Sir Henry Barnard, now besieging the city of\r\nDelhi.\r\n\r\nThat force, on June 8, had fought an action with the mutineers at\r\nBadli-ki-Serai, four miles from Delhi, driving them from their\r\nentrenched position and capturing thirteen guns. The siege of the\r\nMohammedan stronghold had begun on the next day, but the small band\r\nof English, Sikhs, and Goorkhas which composed the force was quite\r\ninadequate to the task entrusted to it, and, in truth, could do nothing\r\nbut act on the defensive against the horde of rebellious sepoys, who\r\noutnumbered them by four to one.\r\n\r\nIt may be conceived with what joy the order to advance was received by\r\nthe officers and men of my regiment. We had at length a prospect of\r\nentering upon a regular campaign, and the hearts of all of us beat high\r\nat the chance of seeing active service against the enemy.\r\n\r\nTo the Colonel commanding it was left to select the five companies\r\ncomposing a wing of the corps to march to Delhi. All, of course, were\r\neager to go, and we knew there would be heart-burnings and regrets\r\namongst those left behind.\r\n\r\nThe following companies were chosen out of the ten: Grenadiers, Nos. 2,\r\n3, 7, and the Light Company. They were the strongest in point of numbers\r\nin the regiment, and with the fewest men in hospital, so that it could\r\nnot be said that any favouritism in selection was shown by the Colonel.\r\nThe wing numbered, all told, including officers and the band, 450 men--a\r\ntimely reinforcement, which, together with the same number of Her\r\nMajesty's 8th Foot from Jullundur, would increase materially the army\r\nbefore Delhi.\r\n\r\nNo time was lost in making preparations for the march. Our camp equipage\r\nwas ready at hand, a sufficient number of elephants, camels, and oxen\r\nwere easily procured from the commissariat authorities, and by eight\r\no'clock that evening we were on our way.\r\n\r\nIn those days a European regiment on the line of march in India\r\npresented a striking scene. Each corps had its own quota of\r\ncamp-followers, numbering in every instance more than the regiment\r\nitself, so that transport was required for fully 2,000 souls, and often\r\nwhen moving along the road the baggage-train extended a mile in length.\r\nThe camp, when pitched, covered a large area of ground. Everything was\r\nregulated with the utmost order, and the positions of the motley group\r\nwere defined to a nicety.\r\n\r\nWe had been directed to take as small a kit as possible, each officer\r\nbeing limited to two camels to carry his tent and personal effects. Our\r\nnative servants accompanied us on the line of march, and I must here\r\nmention that during the long campaign on which we were about to enter\r\nthere was not one single instance of desertion among these faithful and\r\ndevoted followers.\r\n\r\nEverything being ready, we paraded a little before sunset on the evening\r\nof June 13. The terrible heat which prevailed at this time of the\r\nyear prevented us from marching during the day-time. Moreover, it was\r\nnecessary to preserve the health of the soldiers at this critical\r\nperiod, when every European in India was required to make head against\r\nthe rebels. So on every occasion when practicable the English regiments\r\nmoving over the country marched at night, resting under cover of their\r\ntents during the day.[1]\r\n\r\nShortly after sunset, we bade adieu (an eternal one, alas! for many of\r\nthe gallant souls assembled) to the comrades we were leaving behind; the\r\nband struck up, and we set off in high spirits on our long and arduous\r\nmarch of more than 350 miles.\r\n\r\nThe night, as usual, was close and sultry, with a slight hot wind\r\nblowing; but the men stepped out briskly, the soldiers of the leading\r\ncompany presently striking up a well-known song, the chorus of which\r\nwas joined in by the men in the rear. We marched slowly, for it was\r\nnecessary every now and then to halt so as to allow the long train of\r\nbaggage to come up; and it was nearly sunrise before we reached the\r\nfirst halting-ground. The camp was pitched, and we remained under cover\r\nall day, starting, as before, soon after sunset.\r\n\r\nAnd thus passed the sixteen days which were occupied in reaching Delhi.\r\nEvery precaution was taken to prevent surprise, as we were marching,\r\nto all intents and purposes, through an enemy's country, and expected\r\nattacks on our baggage from straggling bodies of mutineers.\r\n\r\n_June 18_.--At Loodianah, five marches from Ferozepore, and which we\r\nreached on June 18, we were fortunate enough to find more comfortable\r\nquarters, the men moving into some of the buildings which had formerly\r\nbeen occupied by Her Majesty's 50th Regiment, the officers living in the\r\nKacherri.\r\n\r\nHere, behind tatties and under punkas, and with iced drinks, we were\r\nable to keep pretty cool; but, sad to say, soon after our arrival in the\r\nstation that terrible scourge cholera broke out in our ranks, and in\r\na few hours six men succumbed to this frightful malady. On every\r\nsucceeding day men were attacked and died, so that, unhappily, up to\r\nJuly 1 we lost in all thirty gallant fellows.\r\n\r\nThis disease never left us during the entire campaign; upwards of 250\r\nsoldiers of my regiment fell victims to the destroyer; nor were we\r\nentirely free from it till the end of the year. Many more were attacked,\r\nwho recovered, but were debarred through excessive weakness from serving\r\nin the ranks, and were invalided home.\r\n\r\n_June 23_.--On reaching Umballah, we found the station all but deserted,\r\nnearly all the European troops having been sent on to join the Delhi\r\nforce. The church had been placed in a state of defence, all its walls\r\nloopholed, and around it had been constructed a work consisting of a\r\nwall and parapet, with towers of brickwork armed with field-pieces _en\r\nbarbette_ at the angles.\r\n\r\nIn it were quartered some of the 1st Bengal Fusiliers, lately brought\r\ndown from Dagshai. About ninety of these marched with us to Delhi. Here\r\nalso we were joined by four officers of the (late) 57th Native Infantry,\r\nwho had received orders to join our wing, eventually to fill up\r\nvacancies in the native corps on reaching the scene of operations. With\r\nthese we were in all twenty-four officers--rather a strong complement\r\neven for a whole regiment.\r\n\r\nThe concluding days of the march were trying in the extreme. Weary and\r\nfootsore, and often parched with thirst, we tramped along the hot and\r\ndusty roads, often for miles up to our ankles in deep sand. We were so\r\ntired and overcome with want of rest that many of us actually fell fast\r\nasleep along the road, and would be rudely awakened by falling against\r\nothers who were in the same plight as ourselves. At midnight we rested,\r\nwhen coffee and refreshment were served out to the officers and men. The\r\nhalt sounded every hour, and for five minutes we threw ourselves down on\r\nthe hard ground or on the hot sand and at once fell asleep, waking up\r\nsomewhat restored to continue our toilsome journey.\r\n\r\nFrom Jugraon onward we had rather long marches, and it was considered\r\nadvisable to convey the men part of the way in hackeries; the\r\narrangement being that they should march halfway, then halt for coffee\r\nand refreshment, and afterwards ride the remainder of the distance.\r\n\r\nBy this means they were kept fresh for the work before them, which, we\r\nhad every reason to believe, would be anything but light. At Umballah\r\nI took the opportunity of calling on my friend Mr. George Barnes,\r\nthe Commissioner of the Cis-Sutlej States. He had shown me boundless\r\nhospitality, and was like a father to me when I joined my regiment as\r\na lad at Kussowlie. A man of great intellectual attainments and sound\r\njudgment, he was an honour to the Bengal Civil Service. There was no\r\nofficer at that momentous period in whom Sir John Lawrence placed\r\nmore confidence. His familiarity with the native character, and the\r\nfriendship borne towards him by the Sikh chieftains, enabled him\r\nthroughout the Siege of Delhi to keep open communication with the\r\nPunjab, and supply the force with stores, provisions, and ammunition.\r\nHe would, without doubt, have risen to the highest honours in his\r\nprofession had he not been stricken with a fatal illness in 1859, when\r\nholding the responsible post of Foreign Secretary to the Government of\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nA few marches from Delhi we passed over the historic field of Paniput,\r\nwhere three sanguinary battles had been fought in different ages, each\r\ndeciding the fate of Hindostan for the time being. More than 100,000\r\nmen had been slain in these actions, and we felt we were marching over\r\nground the dust of which was thickly permeated with the ashes of human\r\nbeings.\r\n\r\nHere first we heard the sound of distant cannonades, borne thus far to\r\nour ears by the stillness of the night--a sound which told us that our\r\ncomrades before Delhi were still holding their position against the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nAt length, on July 1, just as the sun was rising, we emerged from a\r\nforest of trees on to the plain over which the army under Sir Henry\r\nBarnard had moved on June 8 to attack the entrenchments of the mutineers\r\nat Badli-ki-Serai.\r\n\r\n_July_ 1.--Eagerly we cast our eyes over the ground to our front, and\r\nwith pride in our hearts thought of that gallant little force which had\r\nadvanced across this plain on that eventful morn under a terrific fire\r\nfrom the enemy's guns.\r\n\r\nSoon we reached the entrenchments which had been thrown up by the rebels\r\nto bar the progress of our soldiers, and, lying in all directions, we\r\nsaw numerous skeletons of men and horses, the bones already bleached to\r\nwhiteness from the effects of the burning sun. Dead bodies of camels and\r\noxen were also strewn about, and the stench was sickening. We were now\r\nabout four miles from Delhi, and were met by a squadron of the 6th\r\nCarabineers, sent to escort us into camp. They received us with a shout\r\nof welcome, and, while we halted for a short time, inquiries were made\r\nas to the incidents of the siege.\r\n\r\nWe learnt that our small army, with the tenacity of a bulldog, was\r\nholding its own on the ridge overlooking the city, that sorties by the\r\nrebels were of almost daily and nightly occurrence, and that the losses\r\non our side were increasing.\r\n\r\nWith the Carabineers in our front, the march was continued, the white\r\ntents of the besieging force appearing in sight about eight o'clock.\r\nThen the band struck up \"Cheer, boys, cheer!\" and, crossing the canal by\r\na bridge, we entered the camp.\r\n\r\nCrowds of soldiers, European as well as native, stalwart Sikhs and\r\nPunjabees, came down to welcome us on our arrival, the road on each side\r\nbeing lined with swarthy, sun-burnt, and already war-worn men. They\r\ncheered us to the echo, and in their joy rushed amongst our ranks,\r\nshaking hands with both officers and men.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DELHI, FROM THE MOSQUE PICKET.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The heat even under such cover was intense, averaging 115°\r\nFahr.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nBEFORE DELHI\r\n\r\nA situation had already been marked out for our encampment, and,\r\ndirected by an officer, we passed through the main portion of our\r\nlines, and halted at the bottom of the ridge on the extreme left of our\r\nposition. Some time was occupied after the arrival of the baggage in\r\npitching our camp; but when all was concluded, Vicars and I started on\r\nfoot to take our first view of the imperial city.\r\n\r\nWe walked a short distance to the right, and along the foot of the\r\nridge, and then ascended, making our way to the celebrated Flagstaff\r\nTower. We mounted to the top: and shall I ever forget the sight which\r\nmet our gaze?\r\n\r\nAbout a mile to our front, and stretching to right and left as far as\r\nthe eye could reach, appeared the high walls and the bastions of Delhi.\r\nThe intervening space below was covered with a thick forest of trees and\r\ngardens, forming a dense mass of verdure, in the midst of which, and\r\npeeping out here and there in picturesque confusion, were the white\r\nwalls and roofs of numerous buildings. Tall and graceful minarets,\r\nHindoo temples and Mohammedan mosques, symmetrical in shape and gorgeous\r\nin colouring, appeared interspersed in endless numbers among the\r\ndensely-packed houses inside the city, their domes and spires shining\r\nwith a brilliant radiance, clear-cut against the sky. Above all, in the\r\nfar distance towered the Jama Masjid, or Great Mosque, its three huge\r\ndomes of pure white marble, with two high minarets, dwarfing into\r\ninsignificance the buildings by which it was surrounded--surely, the\r\nnoblest work of art ever built by man for the service of the Creator.\r\n\r\nTo the left could be seen the lofty castellated walls of the Palace of\r\nthe Emperors, the former seat of the Great Mogul--that palace in\r\nwhich at that moment the degenerate descendant of Timour, and last\r\nrepresentative of his race, held his court, and in his pride of heart\r\nfondly hoped that British rule was at an end.\r\n\r\nBeyond rose the ancient fortress of Selimgarh, its walls, as well as\r\nthose of the palace on the north side, washed by the waters of the\r\nJumna. A long bridge of boats connected the fort with the opposite bank\r\nof the river, here many hundred yards in width: and over this we could\r\nsee, with the aid of glasses, bodies of armed men moving.\r\n\r\nIt was by this bridge that most of the reinforcements and all the\r\nsupplies for the mutineers crossed over to the city. On the very day of\r\nour arrival the mutinous Bareilly Brigade of infantry and artillery,\r\nnumbering over 3,000 men, marched across this bridge. Our advanced\r\npicket at the Metcalfe House stables, close to the Jumna, heard\r\ndistinctly their bands playing \"Cheer, boys, cheer!\" the very same tune\r\nwith which we had celebrated our entrance into camp that morning.\r\n\r\nFew cities in the world have passed through such vicissitudes as Delhi.\r\nTradition says it was the capital of an empire ages before the great\r\nMacedonian invaded India, and its origin is lost in the mists of\r\nantiquity. Traces there were in every direction, amid the interminable\r\ncluster of ruins and mounds outside the present city, of cities still\r\nmore vast, the builders and inhabitants of which lived before the dawn\r\nof history.\r\n\r\nDelhi had been taken and sacked times out of number. Its riches were\r\nbeyond compare; and for hundreds of years it had been the prey, not only\r\nof every conqueror who invaded India from the north-west, but also of\r\nevery race which, during the perpetual wars in Hindostan, happened for\r\nthe time to be predominant. Tartars, Turks, Afghans, Persians, Mahrattas\r\nand Rajpoots, each in turn in succeeding ages had been masters of the\r\ncity. There had been indiscriminate massacres of the populace, the last\r\nby Nadir Shah, the King of Persia in 1747, when 100,000 souls were put\r\nto death by his order, and booty to a fabulous amount was carried away.\r\nStill, notwithstanding the vicissitudes of fortune through which it had\r\npassed, Delhi was, in 1857, one of the largest, most beautiful, and\r\ncertainly the richest city in Hindostan. We knew well that there was\r\nwealth untold within the walls, and our hearts were cheered even at this\r\ntime when we thought of the prize-money which would fall to our share at\r\nthe capture of the rebellious city.\r\n\r\nThe walls surrounding Delhi were seven miles in circumference, flanked\r\nat intervals by strong bastions, on which the enemy had mounted the\r\nlargest guns and mortars, procured from the arsenal. Munitions of war\r\nthey had in abundance--enough to last them, at the present rate of\r\nfiring, for nearly three years. Long we gazed, fascinated at the scene\r\nbefore us. A dead silence had reigned for some time, when we were\r\nawakened from our dreams by the whiz and hissing of a shell fired by the\r\nenemy. It fell close below the tower and burst without doing any harm;\r\nbut some jets of smoke appeared on the bastions of the city, and shells\r\nand round-shot fired at the ridge along the crest of which a small body\r\nof our men was moving. The cannonade lasted for some time, our own guns\r\nreplying at intervals. We could plainly see the dark forms of the rebel\r\nartillerymen, stripped to the waist, sponging and firing with great\r\nrapidity, their shot being chiefly directed at the three other\r\nbuildings on the ridge--namely, the Observatory--the Mosque, as it was\r\ncalled--and, on the extreme right, Hindoo Rao's house.\r\n\r\nFrom the Flagstaff Tower the ridge trended in a southerly direction\r\ntowards those buildings, approaching gradually nearer and nearer to the\r\ncity, till at Hindoo Rao's house it was distant about 1,200 yards from\r\nthe walls.\r\n\r\nTo the rear of this ridge, and some distance below, so that all view of\r\nDelhi was quite shut out from it, was the camp of the besieging army,\r\nnumbering at this period about 6,000 men. The tents were pitched at\r\nregular intervals behind the ruined houses of the old cantonment, which,\r\nat the outbreak on May 11, had been burnt and destroyed by the sepoys.\r\nA canal which supplied us with water from the Jumna ran round the ridge\r\npast the suburb of Kishenganj into the city, and was crossed by two\r\nbridges, over which communication with the country to the north-west,\r\nand leading to the Punjab, was kept open by the loyal Sikh chieftains\r\nand their retainers.\r\n\r\nOur position on the ridge extended about a mile and a half, the right\r\nand left front flanks defended by outlying advanced pickets, which I\r\nshall hereafter describe.\r\n\r\nThe city walls, as before recorded, were seven miles in circumference,\r\nso that at this time, and, in fact, almost to the end of the siege, we,\r\nwith our small force, in a manner only commanded a small part of the\r\ncity. The bridge of boats remained to the last in the possession of the\r\nenemy, and was quite out of range even from our advanced approaches,\r\nwhile to the right and rear of the city the gates gave full ingress to\r\nreinforcing bodies of insurgents from the south, whose entrance we were\r\nunable to prevent.\r\n\r\nOur investment, if such it could be called, was therefore only partial,\r\nbeing confined to that portion of the city extending from the water\r\nbattery near Selimgarh Fort to the Ajmir Gate, which was just visible\r\nfrom the extreme right of the ridge. This part was defended by, I think,\r\nfour bastions, named, respectively, the Water, Kashmir, Mori, and Burn.\r\nThree gates besides the Lahore gave egress to the mutineers when making\r\nsorties, the afterwards celebrated Kashmir Gate, the Kabul and the Ajmir\r\nGates.\r\n\r\nThe Hindoo Rao's house, on the right of the ridge where it sloped down\r\ninto the plain, was the key of our position, and was defended with great\r\nbravery and unflinching tenacity throughout the whole siege by the\r\nSirmoor battalion of Goorkhas, and portions of the 60th Royal Rifles and\r\nthe Guide Corps. Incessant day and night attacks were here made by the\r\nenemy, who knew that, were that position turned, our camp--in fact, our\r\nvery existence as a besieging force--would be imperilled.\r\n\r\nBut no assault, however strong and determined, made any impression on\r\nthe men of these gallant regiments, led by Major Reid, the officer\r\ncommanding the Sirmoor battalion. They lost in killed and wounded a\r\nnumber far out of all proportion to that of any other corps before\r\nDelhi, and must in truth be reckoned the heroes of the siege.\r\n\r\nThe Goorkhas are recruited in the mountain districts of the Himalayas,\r\nin the kingdom of Nepal. They are short and squat in figure, never more\r\nthan five feet three inches in height, of dark complexion, with deep-set\r\neyes and high cheek-bones denoting their affinity to the Turanian race.\r\nGood-humoured and of a cheerful disposition, they have always been great\r\nfavourites with the European soldiers, whose ways and peculiarities they\r\nendeavour to imitate to a ludicrous extent. In battle, as I have often\r\nseen them, they seem in their proper element, fierce and courageous,\r\nshrinking from no danger. They carried, besides the musket, a short,\r\nheavy, curved knife called a _kukri_, a formidable weapon of which the\r\nsepoys were in deadly terror. As soldiers they are second to none,\r\namenable to discipline and docile, but very tigers when roused; they\r\nfought with unflinching spirit during the Mutiny, freely giving up their\r\nlives in the service of their European masters.\r\n\r\nAnd now that I have endeavoured, for the purposes of this narrative, to\r\nexplain our position and that of the enemy, I shall proceed to recount,\r\nas far as my recollection serves, the main incidents of the siege, and\r\nmore particularly those in which I personally took part.\r\n\r\nThe camp of my regiment was pitched, as I have said, on the extreme\r\nleft of the besieging force, on the rear slope of the ridge. We were\r\ncompletely hidden from any view of the city, and but for the sound\r\nof the firing close by, which seldom ceased day or night, might have\r\nfancied ourselves far away from Delhi.\r\n\r\nCholera still carried off its victims from our midst, and the very night\r\nof our arrival I performed the melancholy duty of reading the Burial\r\nService over five gallant fellows of the Grenadier Company who had died\r\nthat day from the fell disease.\r\n\r\nThe heat was insupportable, the thermometer under the shade of my tent\r\nmarking 112°F.; and to add to our misery there came upon us a plague\r\nof flies, the like of which I verily believe had not been on the\r\nearth since Moses in that manner brought down the wrath of God on the\r\nEgyptians. They literally darkened the air, descending in myriads and\r\ncovering everything in our midst. Foul and loathsome they were, and we\r\nknew that they owed their existence to, and fattened on, the putrid\r\ncorpses of dead men and animals which lay rotting and unburied in\r\nevery direction. The air was tainted with corruption, and the heat was\r\nintense. Can it, then, be wondered that pestilence increased daily in\r\nthe camp, claiming its victims from every regiment, native as well as\r\nEuropean?\r\n\r\nAbout this time many spies were captured and executed; in fact, so many\r\nprisoners were taken by the pickets that it was ordered that for the\r\nfuture, instead of being sent under escort to the camp for trial, they\r\nshould be summarily dealt with by the officers commanding pickets.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of July 2 I was sent, in command of fifty men, to relieve\r\nthe picket at a place called the \"Cow House\"; this was an outshed\r\nbelonging to Sir Theophilus Metcalfe's mansion, burnt by the rebels on\r\nMay 11, and midway between that building and the stables, at each of\r\nwhich were stationed 150 men. At the beginning of the siege our left\r\nadvanced flank, on the side of the River Jumna, was exposed to constant\r\nattacks by the enemy, and the three pickets mentioned above had been\r\nsince that time stationed at those places. Each communicated with the\r\nother, the one to the right being on a mound near the ruins of the\r\nhouse, and some 1,200 yards from the city, the cowshed situated midway\r\nbetween this mound and the river, and, lastly, the stables close to the\r\nbanks, all partially hidden from view of the batteries on the walls by\r\ngardens and thick clusters of trees.\r\n\r\nI stationed my men at the sheds, and placed double rows of sentries to\r\nmy front along the edge of a deep _nallah_, or ravine.\r\n\r\nSoon after this that gallant officer, Lieutenant Hodson (on whose memory\r\nlately aspersions have been cast by an author who knows nothing of the\r\nsubject on which he has written), rode up to the picket and told me that\r\na sortie in force was expected that night, and that I was to keep a\r\nsharp lookout to prevent surprise.\r\n\r\nHodson, besides commanding a regiment of native Sikh cavalry of his own\r\nraising, was head of the Intelligence Department. He covered himself\r\nwith glory during the siege, was untiring in his exertions and well-nigh\r\nubiquitous, riding incessantly round the pickets at night, and being\r\npresent at most of the engagements. He was a perfect Hindustani scholar,\r\nand it was reported in camp, though with what truth I cannot say, that\r\nhe on several occasions entered Delhi in disguise during the siege\r\nto gain information of the enemy's intentions. This may have been\r\nexaggeration, but it is nevertheless certain that, through some source\r\nor other, he made himself well acquainted with the doings and movements\r\nof the mutineers.\r\n\r\nShortly after he left, the field-officer on duty appeared, who ordered\r\nme, in case I should be attacked, to defend my post to the last\r\nextremity, and in no case to fall back, adding that to my picket, and to\r\nthose on my right and left, the safety of the camp during the expected\r\nsortie, together with the security of our left flank, was entrusted.\r\n\r\nAfter darkness set in the enemy commenced a furious cannonade in the\r\ndirection of the three pickets, round shot whistling through the trees\r\nand shells bursting around us. The din and roar were deafening, but\r\nfiring, as they did, at random, little damage was done. Nothing can be\r\ngrander than the sight of live shells cleaving the air on a dark night.\r\nThey seemed like so many brilliant meteors rushing through the heavens,\r\nor like lightning-flashes during a storm, and this being my first\r\nexperience of the sort, no words can paint my awe and admiration.\r\n\r\nWe naturally expected an attack in force from the insurgents under cover\r\nof the cannonade; but hours passed by in suspense and anxiety, and\r\nnone was attempted. The firing was continued all night--sleep being\r\nimpossible--and ceased only at daybreak, when the relief arrived, and I\r\nmarched the picket back to our camp.\r\n\r\n_July 3_.--That day the monsoon--the Indian wet season--set in, and rain\r\ndescended in sheets of water for many hours.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon it was reported that a large force of mutineers was\r\nmoving out of the city by the Kabul and Ajmir Gates into the suburbs\r\nto the right front of our position, and the alarm sounded, most of the\r\ntroops in camp turning out and assembling on the road to the rear of\r\nthe canal. Here we were halted for some time, it being uncertain what\r\ndirection had been taken by the enemy.\r\n\r\nAt sunset two doolies, escorted by men of the 5th Punjab Cavalry, were\r\nseen on the road coming towards us. They contained the bodies of a\r\nEuropean sergeant and a man of the Road Department, who had been\r\nsurprised and cut to pieces by some of the rebel cavalry. The escort\r\nalso reported that a body of insurgents numbering many thousand men had\r\nbeen seen moving towards Alipore, one march in our rear, their object,\r\nit was supposed, being to cut off supplies and intercept treasure.\r\n\r\nIt being too late to start in pursuit of the enemy, we were dismissed to\r\nour quarters, being warned to hold ourselves in readiness to turn out at\r\na moment's notice.\r\n\r\n_July 4_.--That night the sound of the enemy's guns to our rear was\r\nheard in the camp, and soon after 2 a. m. we paraded, and joined a force\r\ndestined to overtake or cut off the mutineers on their return to Delhi.\r\nThe little army, consisting of 1,500 men, cavalry, artillery, and\r\ninfantry, marched at once towards Alipore. After we had proceeded three\r\nmiles, and just at daybreak, news was brought that the enemy, after\r\nplundering the town, were retreating to the city laden with booty.\r\n\r\nMajor Coke, who was in command, then changed our direction to the left,\r\nand we advanced for about two miles over swampy ground to a canal,\r\nthe cavalry being in front, then the infantry, the battery of Horse\r\nArtillery bringing up the rear.\r\n\r\nWhen near the canal, which was shaded on each side by trees, the Major\r\nadvanced to reconnoitre, and on his return, the order was given, \"Guns\r\nto the front!\" The Horse Artillery galloped past us, and we then heard\r\nthat the enemy were in sight on the other side of the canal.\r\n\r\nCrossing a bridge, and passing through trees and jungle, the whole force\r\ndebouched on an open plain, and formed in order of battle. The first\r\nline consisted of the artillery, in the centre, flanked on each side by\r\nthe cavalry--cavalry--portions of the 9th Lancers, the Carabineers, and\r\nthat fine regiment, the Guide Corps. Coke's Corps of Punjabees and my\r\nregiment formed the second line.\r\n\r\nIt was a pretty sight to see this miniature army advancing in perfect\r\norder towards the enemy. The plain extended for a mile quite open and\r\nwithout trees, bounded at that distance by a village, in which the\r\ninsurgent guns were posted. Clouds of horsemen, apparently without any\r\nformation, hovered on each side of the village, and a large force of\r\ninfantry was standing in line somewhat in advance.\r\n\r\nOur guns came into action at a distance of about 1,000 yards from the\r\nvillage, and were soon answered by those of the enemy, their shot\r\nstriking unpleasantly close to our line, and ricochetting over our\r\nheads. Still we advanced, hoping that the rebels would stand till we\r\ncame to close quarters. At 500 yards the fire from our artillery seemed\r\nto prove too hot for them; and presently, to our infinite disgust, we\r\nsaw their infantry moving off to the left, followed shortly after by the\r\ncavalry. Then their guns ceased firing, and were also quickly withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThe Carabineers and Guides were sent in pursuit, and cut up some\r\nstragglers; but the insurgents stampeded at a great pace, and succeeded\r\nin carrying off all their guns.\r\n\r\nA few sepoys were found hiding in the village huts, and were killed by\r\nour men, the Alipore plunder was recovered, besides some ammunition and\r\ncamp equipment, and, rather dissatisfied with the result of the action,\r\nwe moved slowly back across the plain.\r\n\r\nThe regiment was commanded on this occasion by our senior Captain, an\r\nofficer of some thirty-five years' service. He was, without exception,\r\nthe greatest oddity for a soldier that our army has ever seen. Five feet\r\ntwo inches in height, with an enormous head, short, hunchback body, long\r\narms, and thin, shrivelled legs, his whole appearance reminded one\r\nof Dickens' celebrated character Quilp, in the \"Old Curiosity Shop.\"\r\nEntering the service in the \"good\" old times, when there was no\r\nexamination by a medical man, he had, through some back-door influence,\r\nobtained a commission in the army. All his service had been passed\r\nabroad, exchanging from one regiment to another, for it would have been\r\nutterly impossible for him to have retained his commission in England.\r\nMarching, he was unable to keep step with the men, and on horseback he\r\npresented the most ludicrous appearance, being quite unable to ride,\r\nand looking more like a monkey than a human being. On our first advance\r\nacross the plain the little Captain was riding in our front, vainly\r\nendeavouring to make his horse move faster, and striking him every now\r\nand then on the flanks with his sword. I was on the right of the line,\r\nand, together with the men, could not keep from laughing, when a friend\r\nof mine--a tall officer of one of the native infantry regiments--rode to\r\nmy side and asked me who that was leading the regiment. I answered, \"He\r\nis our commanding officer.\"\r\n\r\nThe sun shone with intense heat on our march back across the plain, and\r\nthe European soldiers began to feel its effects, many being struck down\r\nwith apoplexy. About midday the infantry halted at the canal, the guns\r\nand most of the cavalry returning to camp, as it was supposed there\r\nwould be no more work for them to do. We lay down in the welcome shade\r\nof the trees on the bank, enjoying our breakfast, which had been brought\r\nto us by our native servants, and, in company with an officer of the 9th\r\nLancers, I was discussing a bottle of ale, the sweetest draught I think\r\nI have ever tasted. The arms were piled in our front, and at intervals\r\nwe watched, as they crossed the canal, a troop of elephants which had\r\nbeen sent out to bring the sick and wounded into camp.\r\n\r\nAll at once, from our left front, and without any warning, shots came\r\nwhistling through the trees and jungle, and some men lying on the ground\r\nwere hit. The regiment at once fell in and changed front to the left,\r\nmoving in the direction from which the shots were coming.\r\n\r\nFrightened at the sound of the firing, the elephants were seized with a\r\npanic and made off across the canal. Trumpeting, with their trunks high\r\nabove their heads, they floundered through the water to the opposite\r\nside, their drivers vainly attempting to stop their flight. We saw them\r\ndisappearing through the trees, and learnt afterwards that they never\r\nstopped till close to their own quarters at the camp.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the shots came thick and fast, and we advanced in line till we\r\ncame to a comparatively open space, and in sight of the enemy--a large\r\nbody of infantry outnumbering us by four to one. They were at no great\r\ndistance from us, and a sharp musketry fire was kept up from both sides,\r\ncausing heavy losses.\r\n\r\nSeeing that no object was to be gained with our small force by\r\nencountering one so vastly superior, Major Coke deemed it prudent to\r\nretire, and retreating firing, we crossed the bridge and lined the bank\r\non each side.\r\n\r\nThe enemy followed, their men forming opposite to us and keeping up a\r\nsteady fire at a distance of from 100 to 150 yards. I was on the right\r\nof the line with the Grenadiers, when, half an hour later, I was\r\ndirected by the Adjutant to march my men to the left of the bridge\r\nto reinforce the Light Company, who were being hard pressed by the\r\ninsurgents, some of whom were wading through the canal, with the evident\r\nintention of turning our left flank. We crept along under the bank, and\r\nwere received with joy by our comrades, one of them, I well remember,\r\nwelcoming us in most forcible language, and intimating that they would\r\nsoon have been sent to--if we had not come.\r\n\r\nThe file-firing here was continuous, a perfect hail of bullets, and it\r\nwas dangerous to show one's head over the bank. Shouting and taunting\r\nus, the rebels came up close to the opposite side, and were struck down\r\nin numbers by our men, who rested their muskets on the bank and took\r\nsure aim. Still, the contest was most unequal; the enemy were wading in\r\nforce through the water on our left, and the day would have gone hard\r\nwith us from their overwhelming numerical superiority, when, just at\r\nthis critical moment, the galloping of horses and the noise of wheels\r\nwas heard in our rear.\r\n\r\nSix Horse Artillery guns, led by Major Tombs--one of the most gallant\r\nofficers in camp--came thundering along the road. They passed with\r\na cheer, crossed the bridge at full speed, wheeled to their left,\r\nunlimbered as quick as lightning, and opened fire on the rebels. Taken\r\ncompletely by surprise, these made no stand, and fled pell-mell towards\r\nDelhi, leaving altogether 200 dead on the ground.\r\n\r\nIt was now nearly five o'clock, and we were distant four miles from\r\ncamp. Many of our men had died from apoplexy and sunstroke, their faces\r\nturning quite black in a few minutes--a horrible sight. These, with the\r\nkilled and the sick and wounded, were placed on the backs of a fresh lot\r\nof elephants, which had just arrived; and, scarcely able to drag one leg\r\nafter the other, we turned our faces towards the camp, reaching our own\r\nquarters soon after sunset.\r\n\r\nThis was a terrible and trying day for all engaged, and more especially\r\nfor the European infantry. We had been under arms for seventeen hours,\r\nmost of the time exposed to the pitiless rays of an Indian sun, under\r\nfire for a considerable period, and, with the exception of the slight\r\nhalt for breakfast, on our feet all the time.\r\n\r\nWhen nearing camp we were met by the General, Sir Henry Barnard, who\r\naddressed us with some kindly words, and little did we think that\r\nthat was the last occasion we should see the gallant old soldier. The\r\nfollowing morning he was attacked with cholera, and expired in the\r\nafternoon, deeply regretted by the whole army.\r\n\r\nNo man could possibly have been placed in a more trying situation than\r\nhe who had just given up his life in the service of his country. Called\r\non to command an army to which was entrusted the safety of British\r\nrule in India, the cares and anxiety of the task, together with his\r\nunremitting attention to his duties and constant exposure to the sun,\r\nmade him peculiarly susceptible to the disease from which he died. He\r\nhad served with distinction in the Crimean campaign, and had only landed\r\nin India to take command of a division in the April of this year.\r\n\r\n_July 5_.--From July 5 to 8 nothing of note occurred. The enemy kept up,\r\nas usual, a constant fire upon the ridge and outlying pickets; but no\r\nattempt at a sortie was made.\r\n\r\nI visited the Flagstaff Tower each day when off duty, seemingly never\r\ntired of gazing at the glorious panorama spread out before me, and\r\nwatching the batteries delivering their unceasing fire.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of two 24-pound cannon taken from the enemy, for\r\nwhich we had no shot, the heaviest guns on the ridge were 18-pounders\r\nand a few small mortars. Having possession of the great arsenal, the\r\ninsurgents mounted on the bastions of Delhi 32-and 24-pounder guns and\r\n13-inch mortars, their trained artillerymen acquitting themselves right\r\nvaliantly, and making excellent practice. They were almost to a\r\nman killed at their guns during the siege, and towards the end the\r\ndifference in firing was fully perceptible, when the infantry filled\r\ntheir places and worked the guns.\r\n\r\nHaving no round-shot for the two 24-pounders, we were reduced to firing\r\nback on the city the shot of the same calibre hurled against us, and\r\na reward of half a rupee per shot was paid by the commissariat to any\r\ncamp-follower bringing in the missiles.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion I saw a party of native servants, carrying on their\r\nheads cooked provisions for the men on picket, wend their way up the\r\nslope from the camp. Two round-shot fired by the enemy struck the top\r\nof the ridge and rolled down the declivity. Here was a prize worth\r\ncontending for, and the cooks, depositing the dishes on the ground, ran\r\nin all haste to seize the treasures. I watched the race with interest,\r\nand anticipated some fun, knowing that in their eagerness they would\r\nforget that the shots had not had time to cool. Two men in advance of\r\nthe rest picked up the balls, and, uttering a cry, dropped them quickly,\r\nrubbing and blowing their hands. The remainder stood patiently waiting,\r\nand then, after a time, spent evidently in deliberation, two men placed\r\nthe shot on their heads, and all in a body moved off towards the\r\ncommissariat quarters to receive and divide the reward.\r\n\r\n_July 7_.--On the morning of July 7, I accompanied a detachment of 150\r\nmen under command of a Captain to relieve the picket at the mound close\r\nto the ruins of Sir Theophilus Metcalfe's house. This mansion, built by\r\nthe present baronet's father, was situated about 1,200 yards from the\r\nwalls of the city, and surrounded by trees and gardens. At the outbreak\r\nof May 11, it had been plundered and burnt by the mutinous sepoys and\r\n_badmashes_, who also in like manner had destroyed every house belonging\r\nto the Europeans in the suburbs of Delhi and the adjoining cantonment.\r\nOf the murders that then took place I shall have something to say\r\nhereafter, when writing the history of a young school-fellow whose\r\nsister was killed by the insurgents.\r\n\r\nFrom our position on picket we could see a short distance in front, the\r\nground having been partially cleared of trees and undergrowth. A chain\r\nof double sentries was posted, and the utmost vigilance observed. We\r\ncould hear the batteries opening on the ridge, while occasionally, as if\r\nto harass the picket, a 13-inch shell would burst either in our front or\r\nin our rear. The night passed quickly, and at daybreak, when visiting\r\nthe sentries, I heard distinctly the bugles of the rebels sounding the\r\nreveille, succeeded by other familiar calls. It seemed strange to hear\r\nour own bugle-calls sounded by men who were now our enemies; and not\r\nonly was this the case, but also the insurgents for some time wore the\r\nscarlet uniform of the British soldiers, and invariably to the end of\r\nthe war gave the English words of command they had been taught in our\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nWe were relieved from picket on the morning of the 8th, and returned to\r\nour camp, remaining quiet during the day. Executions by hanging took\r\nplace every day, but after the first horrible experience nothing would\r\ninduce me to be a spectator. The rain, which had begun on the 3rd,\r\ncontinued almost without intermission, our camp becoming a quagmire, and\r\nthe muggy, moist atmosphere increasing the ravages of cholera amongst\r\nour unfortunate soldiers.\r\n\r\n_July 9_.--At sunrise on the 9th, a terrific cannonade woke us out of\r\nour sleep; but, the main camp being some distance from the right of the\r\nridge, we for a long time heard no tidings of what was going on. At 8 a.\r\nm. the bugles of the regiments on the right sounded the alarm, followed\r\nat once by the \"assembly.\"\r\n\r\nSome 200 men of my regiment, all that remained off duty, paraded in\r\nfront of the tents, and received orders to march to the centre rear of\r\nthe camp, in rear of the quarters of the General in command. Here we\r\nwere joined by some companies of the 8th Regiment and a battalion of\r\nSikhs, and, continuing our march, we halted near the tents of Tombs'\r\nbattery of Horse Artillery.\r\n\r\nLying around and even among the tent-ropes were dead bodies of the\r\nenemy's cavalry, and a little way beyond, close to the graveyard,\r\nsome men of the 75th were firing into the branches of the trees which\r\nsurrounded the enclosure. Every now and then the body of a rebel would\r\nfall on the ground at their feet, the soldiers laughing and chatting\r\ntogether, and making as much sport out of the novel business as though\r\nthey were shooting at birds in the branches of a tree.\r\n\r\nHow the native cavalry came there was at first inexplicable to us; but\r\nwe were informed afterwards that a body of irregular horsemen, dressed\r\nin white, the same uniform as that worn by the 9th Irregulars on our\r\nside, had, with the greatest daring, an hour before dashed across the\r\ncanal bridge and charged the picket of the Carabineers, making also for\r\nthe two guns of Tombs' battery. The former, mostly young soldiers, had\r\nturned and fled, all save their officer and one sergeant, who nobly\r\nstood their ground. Lieutenant Hills, who commanded the two guns on\r\npicket, also alone charged the horsemen, cutting down one or two of the\r\nsowars.\r\n\r\nMeantime the guns were unlimbered, but before they had time to fire, the\r\nenemy were upon them. Hills was struck down badly wounded, and was on\r\nthe point of being despatched by a sowar, when Major Tombs, hearing the\r\nnoise, rushed out of his tent, and seeing the plight his subaltern was\r\nin, fired his revolver at thirty yards and killed the sowar.\r\n\r\nThe camp was now fairly alarmed; the guns of Olpherts' battery opened on\r\nthe enemy, and, some men of the 75th appearing on the scene, the rebels\r\nwere shot down in every direction, thirty-five being killed, and the\r\nrest escaping by the bridge. A few climbed into the trees and were shot\r\ndown as I have said before.\r\n\r\nThis attack by the enemy's cavalry was a fitting prelude to the events\r\nof the memorable sortie of that day.\r\n\r\nAt early morn, under cover of an unceasing cannonade from the city\r\nbatteries on to the right of our position, the insurgents in great force\r\nand of all arms streamed out from the gates, making in the direction\r\nof the suburb of Kishenganj, their evident intention being to turn our\r\nright flank and make for our camp.\r\n\r\nSeeing that the enemy were increasing in numbers, and coming on with\r\ngreat determination, the alarm had sounded; and detachments from most of\r\nthe regiments, with Horse Artillery and a few cavalry under the command\r\nof Brigadier-General Chamberlain, marched towards the right rear of the\r\ncamp, taking the road to the suburb of Kishenganj.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the canal at about 10 a. m., and, moving in column for some\r\nlittle distance, came in sight of advanced bodies of the enemy, chiefly\r\ninfantry with cavalry and field artillery on each flank. We formed in\r\nline, sending out skirmishers, the guns opened fire--the country here\r\nbeing pretty open--and the action began.\r\n\r\nSoon we drove back the rebels, who continued retreating in excellent\r\norder, turning at intervals and discharging their muskets, while every\r\nnow and then their guns were faced about and unlimbered, and round-shot\r\nand grape sent among our ranks. As we advanced, the vegetation became\r\nthicker, and we were confronted at times by high hedges of prickly-pear\r\nand cactus, growing so close together that it was impossible to make\r\nour way through. This occasioned several détours, the sepoys lining the\r\nhedges and firing at us through loopholes and openings, cursing the\r\n_gore log_[1] and daring us to come on.\r\n\r\nThe rain, which had kept off during the morning, now descended in a\r\nsteady downpour, soaking through our thin cotton clothing, and in a few\r\nminutes drenching us to the skin.\r\n\r\nPassing the obstacles on each flank, the force again formed in as good\r\norder as the inequalities of the ground would permit, and continued its\r\nadvance, all the time under a heavy fire of artillery and musketry. We\r\ncaught glimpses of the enemy retreating towards the Kishenganj Serai,\r\nbut the vegetation was so dense in the numerous gardens, and the view so\r\nobstructed by stone walls and ruined buildings, that it was with great\r\ndifficulty that we made any progress, nor, having the advantage of so\r\nmuch cover, did the enemy suffer much loss from our musketry fire.\r\n\r\nMany of our men fell at this period of the fight; despising the enemy\r\nand refusing to take cover, our soldiers would stand out exposed and\r\ndeliver their fire, offering a sure aim to the enemy's marksmen. It\r\nwas a continual rush from one point to another, halting and firing\r\nat intervals, the rebels all the time slowly retreating. Our Horse\r\nArtillery at this juncture could only act on occasions, the ground being\r\nso broken that the guns were often brought to a standstill.\r\n\r\nAll this time the batteries on the ridge, which from their high position\r\ncould see what was going on, sent shells and round-shot at every\r\nopportunity over our heads, dispersing the mutineers when grouped\r\ntogether in any large number, and dealing death amongst them.\r\n\r\nWe saw them lying in heaps of twenty and thirty as we advanced, and the\r\nfire was so hot and the practice so excellent that the enemy evacuated\r\nthe gardens and fled towards the suburb of Kishenganj.\r\n\r\nHere the country was more open, so, re-forming our scattered line,\r\nwith skirmishers in advance, we drove the rebels before us, the Horse\r\nArtillery playing on them in the open and bringing down scores.\r\n\r\nCrossing the canal (which here barred our progress) by a bridge, we\r\nentered into a wide lane to the left, the high bank of the canal being\r\non one side and the walls of a large caravanserai on the other.\r\n\r\nThe insurgents were posted at the far end of the lane, where it opened\r\nout at the gate of the serai, and received us, as we advanced at the\r\ndouble, with a rattling fire of musketry. Some climbed to the top of the\r\nbank, while others fired down at us from the walls. It was a perfect\r\n_feu d'enfer_, and the loss on our side became so heavy that a temporary\r\ncheck was the result, and it was only with great trouble that the men\r\ncould be urged on.\r\n\r\nSeeing a disposition to waver, Colonel W. Jones, the Brigadier under\r\nChamberlain, with great bravery placed himself in front on foot, and\r\ncalled on the soldiers, now a confused mass of Sikhs, Goorkhas, and\r\nEuropeans, to charge and dislodge the enemy from the end of the lane.\r\nHe was answered with a ringing cheer, the men broke into a run, and,\r\nwithout firing a shot, charged the sepoys, who waited till we were\r\nwithin fifty yards, and then, as usual, turned and fled.\r\n\r\nSome entered the caravanserai by the large gate, which they attempted\r\nto shut; but we were too quick for them, and following close on their\r\nheels, a hard fight began in the enclosure.\r\n\r\nOthers of the enemy ran onwards in the direction of the city, chased by\r\nportions of our force, who pursued them a long distance, and after a\r\ndesperate resistance killed many who in their flight had taken refuge in\r\nthe serais and buildings.\r\n\r\nThe party I was with in the great caravanserai ranged the place like\r\ndemons, the English soldiers putting to death every sepoy they could\r\nfind. Their aspect was certainly inhuman--eyes flashing with passion and\r\nrevenge, faces wet and blackened from powder through biting cartridges;\r\nit would have been useless to attempt to check them in their work of\r\nslaughter.\r\n\r\nTwenty or more of the insurgents, flying for life from their pitiless\r\nfoe, made for a small building standing in the centre of the serai. They\r\nwere followed by our men, who entered after them at the door. The house\r\nhad four windows, one on each side, about three feet from the ground,\r\nand I ran to one and looked in.\r\n\r\nThe wretched fugitives had thrown down their arms and, crouching on the\r\nfloor with their backs to the wall, begged with out-stretched hands for\r\nmercy, calling out in their language, \"_Dohai! dohai!_\" words I\r\nwell knew the meaning of, and which I had often heard under similar\r\ncircumstances. I knew, however, that no quarter would be given, and in a\r\nshort time every rebel lay in the agonies of death.\r\n\r\nMost of the force, as I have related, had continued chasing the enemy,\r\nso that for some time we were alone and few in number in the serai.\r\nIt was nearly five o'clock, and we thought that, as far as we were\r\nconcerned, the action was over.\r\n\r\nIt was not so, however. Shouts and yells were heard outside, and,\r\nrunning to see, we found a fresh force of the mutineers assembled\r\noutside the gates. There was nothing for it but to make a rush and fight\r\nour way through; so with fixed bayonets we charged through them, meeting\r\nsoon afterwards the remainder of the force on its way back. Joining with\r\nthese, we drove the enemy again before us till we came within 700 yards\r\nof the city walls, there losing sight of our foes. Their guns fired\r\ninto us, but the insurgent infantry seemed now to have had sufficient\r\nfighting for one day, and not one man was to be seen.\r\n\r\nOur work was accomplished, and the order was given to retire. Slowly we\r\nwended our way back to camp, arriving there about sunset, having been\r\ncontinuously under fire for nearly seven hours.\r\n\r\nThe losses on this day exceeded that of any since the siege began. Out\r\nof our small force engaged, 221 men were killed and wounded. It was\r\ncomputed that of the enemy more than 500 were killed, and probably twice\r\nthat number wounded, the dead bodies lying thick together at every\r\nstage of our advance, but the wounded men in almost every instance were\r\ncarried off by their comrades.\r\n\r\nThe camp of our regiment on the extreme left of the line having become a\r\nmere swamp and mud hole from the long-continued rain, and also being at\r\ntoo great a distance from the main body of the army, we were directed to\r\nchange to a position close to the banks of the canal, near the General's\r\nheadquarters, and on the left of the 8th Regiment. The move was made, I\r\nthink, on July 11; and here we remained till the end of the siege.\r\n\r\nAt about this period, too, I was most agreeably surprised by a visit\r\nfrom an old school-fellow named C---- d. He had entered the Bengal\r\nCivil Service a few years before, and, at the breaking out of the\r\ndisturbances, was Assistant Collector at Goorgaon, seventeen miles from\r\nDelhi. On the death of their mother in Ireland, an only sister, a\r\nyoung girl of eighteen years of age, came out to India to take up her\r\nresidence with him. C---- d escorted his sister to Delhi on May 10, she\r\nhaving received an invitation to stay with the chaplain and his wife,\r\nwho had quarters in the Palace. He returned to Goorgaon, little thinking\r\nhe would never see her again.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, on the arrival of the insurgent cavalry from Meerut,\r\nand the subsequent mutiny of the native infantry regiments and artillery\r\nin the cantonments, the massacre of the Europeans in Delhi began.\r\n\r\nI forbear entering into all the details of this dreadful butchery;\r\nsuffice it to say that the chaplain, Mr. Jennings, his wife, Miss\r\nC---- d, and nearly all the white people, both in the Palace and the\r\ncity, were murdered. The editor of the _Delhi Gazette_ and his family\r\nwere tortured to death by having their throats cut with pieces of broken\r\nbottles, but there were conflicting accounts as to how the Jenningses\r\nand Miss C---- d met their end. From what I gathered after the siege from\r\nsome Delhi natives, it was reported that the ladies were stripped naked\r\nat the Palace, tied in that condition to the wheels of gun-carriages,\r\ndragged up the \"Chandni Chauk,\" or silver street of Delhi, and there, in\r\nthe presence of the King's sons, cut to pieces.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the following evening, May 12, that C---- d heard of the\r\nMutiny, and, fearing death from the populace of Goorgaon, who had also\r\nrisen in revolt, he disguised himself as best he could and rode off into\r\nthe country. After enduring great privations, and the danger of being\r\ntaken by predatory bands, he at last reached Meerut, and thence\r\naccompanied the force to Delhi.\r\n\r\nFrom what he hinted, I feel sure he had it on his mind that his sister,\r\nbefore being murdered, was outraged by the rebels. However this may be,\r\nmy old school-fellow had become a changed being. All his passions were\r\naroused to their fullest extent, and he thought of nothing but revenge.\r\nArmed with sword, revolver, and rifle, he had been present at almost\r\nevery engagement with the mutineers since leaving Meerut. He was known\r\nto most of the regiments in camp, and would attach himself to one or\r\nthe other on the occasion of a fight, dealing death with his rifle\r\nand giving no quarter. Caring nothing for his own life, so long as he\r\nsucceeded in glutting his vengeance on the murderers of his sister, he\r\nexposed himself most recklessly throughout the siege, and never received\r\na wound.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the final assault I met him in one of the streets after we\r\nhad gained entrance into the city. He shook my hands, saying that he had\r\nput to death all he had come across, not excepting women and children,\r\nand from his excited manner and the appearance of his dress--which was\r\ncovered with blood-stains--I quite believe he told me the truth. One\r\nwould imagine he must have tired of slaughter during those six days'\r\nfighting in the city, but it was not so. I dined with him at the Palace\r\nthe night Delhi was taken, when he told me he intended accompanying\r\na small force the next morning to attack a village close by. All my\r\nremonstrances at this were of no avail; he vowed to me he would never\r\nstay his hand while he had an opportunity of wreaking his vengeance.\r\nPoor fellow! that was his last fight; advancing in front of the\r\nsoldiers, he met his death from a bullet in the heart when assaulting\r\nthe village.\r\n\r\nThere were other officers of the army in camp who had lost wives and\r\nrelations at Delhi and Meerut, and who behaved in the same manner as\r\nC---- d. One in particular, whose wife I had known well, was an object of\r\npity to the whole camp. She was the first woman who was murdered during\r\nthe outrage at Meerut, and her death took place under circumstances of\r\nsuch shocking barbarity that they cannot be recorded in these pages.\r\n\r\nTruly these were fearful times, when Christian men and gallant soldiers,\r\nmaddened by the foul murder of those nearest and dearest to them,\r\nsteeled their hearts to pity and swore vengeance against the murderers.\r\nAnd much the same feelings, though not to such an extent, pervaded the\r\nbreasts of all who were engaged in the suppression of the Mutiny. Every\r\nsoldier fighting in our ranks knew that a day of reckoning would come\r\nfor the atrocities which had been committed, and with unrelenting spirit\r\ndedicated himself to the accomplishment of that purpose. Moreover, it\r\nwas on our part a fight for existence, a war of extermination, in which\r\nno prisoners were taken and no mercy shown--in short, one of the most\r\ncruel and vindictive wars that the world has seen.\r\n\r\nFrom July 10 to 14 there was comparative quiet in the camp; the\r\ncannonade continued on each side, but no sorties were made by the enemy.\r\n\r\n_July 12_.--On the morning of the 12th I was detailed for picket duty at\r\nthe Sabzi Mandi Gardens, to the right front of Hindoo Rao's house, the\r\npicket consisting of 100 men under the command of a Captain. Since\r\nthe opening of the siege this had been the scene of many sanguinary\r\nencounters with the enemy, who put forth all their strength in\r\nendeavours to drive in the picket, and so turn our right flank at Hindoo\r\nRao's house.\r\n\r\nThe view at first was almost completely closed in; but by the end of\r\nJuly the unremitting labours of the Engineers had cleared away the\r\ntrees, walls, and buildings in front of the picket for some distance,\r\nand the earth-works connecting it with the ridge at Hindoo Rao's house\r\nwere also completed.\r\n\r\nI can remember no event of interest as occurring on July 12. Few shots\r\nwere fired at us, and on being relieved the next morning we returned to\r\ncamp, wondering at the unusual inactivity of the enemy.\r\n\r\n_July 14_.--They were, however, only preparing for another sortie on a\r\ngrand scale, and on the morning of the 14th the bugles again sounded the\r\n\"alarm\" and the \"assembly.\" The insurgents poured out of the Kabul and\r\nLahore Gates in great numbers, making, as usual, for the Sabzi Mandi\r\nGardens and the right of the ridge. They kept up a constant fire of\r\nmusketry and field-artillery; and though our batteries swept their\r\nmasses with shell and round-shot, they still continued the attack,\r\npressing close to the pickets and Hindoo Rao's house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SMALL PICKET, SABZI MANDI, FROM THE SOUTH-EAST.]\r\n\r\nShortly after midday a column of some 1,500 men was assembled to\r\ndislodge and drive them back to the city. We took the road as on the\r\n9th, and soon became engaged with the enemy in the Sabzi Mandi Gardens.\r\nThe struggle was long and fierce, a perpetual interchange of musketry\r\nand artillery, our losses, especially in officers, being very severe.\r\nThe city batteries also sent grape and canister amongst us from their\r\nlarge guns and howitzers, inflicting mortal wounds, even at the great\r\ndistance of 1,100 yards.\r\n\r\nWhen driving the rebels before us past the suburb of Kishenganj,\r\nLieutenant Gabbett and I, in the confusion of the rush, became separated\r\nfrom the few men of our regiment who were engaged on that day, and found\r\nourselves--we being the only officers present--with about fifty soldiers\r\nof different corps. For more than half an hour we were completely\r\nisolated from the main body, and were occupied in several little fights\r\non our own account. Advancing, we scarcely knew where, and in our\r\nexcitement fully engaged in chasing the foe, we all at once came most\r\nunexpectedly on to a broad road, with open ground on each side. There,\r\nto our front, and scarcely 500 yards distant, we saw a gate with\r\nembattled towers, the high walls of the city, and a bastion. We were\r\nsoon descried by the enemy, who depressed their guns and fired at us\r\nwith grape, fortunately without hitting any of our party. We were in a\r\ncomplete dilemma, under fire of the batteries, cut off from our force,\r\nand liable at any moment to be surrounded; so, deeming discretion the\r\nbetter part of valour, we turned about and ran with all speed to the\r\nrear, coming upon a troop of Horse Artillery, which was halted amongst\r\nsome gardens.\r\n\r\nSoon the main body of our force returned from the pursuit of the rebels,\r\nwhom they had driven to within 600 yards of the city wall; and joining\r\nour own detachment, who had given us up as lost, we returned to camp\r\nabout sundown.\r\n\r\nAgain we had to lament the loss of many fine officers and soldiers.\r\nNearly 200 men had been killed and wounded--a sad diminution of our\r\nlittle army, which, had it long continued, would have entirely decimated\r\nthe Delhi Field Force. The enemy, however, had suffered most severely,\r\ntheir loss amounting to quite 1,000 men; and the next morning they were\r\nseen for hours carting the dead bodies into the city. Unusual bravery\r\nwas shown by the rebels on this day: they stood fairly in the open, and\r\nalso attacked the pickets with great pertinacity, assaulting one called\r\nthe \"Sammy House\" for hours, and leaving eighty dead bodies in its\r\nfront, all killed by the infantry of the Guides, who most gallantly held\r\nthe picket against overwhelming numbers.\r\n\r\nCholera all this time raged in the force, and carried off its victims\r\ndaily, my own regiment and the 8th being the principal sufferers. It was\r\nmelancholy to enter the hospital, to see the agony and hear the groans\r\nof the men, many of them with their dying breath lamenting the hard fate\r\nwhich had stretched them on a sick-bed and prevented them from doing\r\ntheir duty in the ranks against the enemy. Fever and ague, too, were\r\nvery prevalent, and hospital gangrene broke out, which attained such\r\nvirulence that many wounded died from its effects; while of amputations,\r\nI believe not one recovered during the whole siege.\r\n\r\nWe were also in the midst of the Indian monsoon, the most unhealthy\r\nseason of the year, when rain descended in torrents almost every day, a\r\nhot, muggy atmosphere increasing the sickness and adding to the eternal\r\nplague of flies, a plague the most nauseating it has ever been my lot to\r\nexperience. When off duty, it was the custom of some of the officers\r\nto pass the time fishing in the canal at our rear. Here, seated on\r\ncamp-stools brought out by our servants, we amused ourselves for hours,\r\nholding lotteries as to who would catch the first fish, the prize being\r\na bottle of beer. To see us on these occasions, full of merriment, one\r\nwould scarcely have realized the fact that the men employed in this\r\npeaceful occupation were part of an army engaged in almost continual\r\nwarfare, and fighting for very existence. Laughter and jokes filled\r\nthe air, and chaff reigned supreme; while ever and anon we were rudely\r\nrecalled to a sense of the dangers around us by the report of a shell\r\nbursting over the ridge, or the presence of an orderly, who summoned one\r\nof the party to proceed on picket or on some perilous duty at the front.\r\n\r\nWith regard to provisions, we were plentifully supplied with regular\r\nmeals, a sufficiency of good food and drinkables; our lot in this\r\nrespect was far more enjoyable than that of the usual run of\r\ncampaigners. A large flock of fat sheep accompanied us on the march down\r\nfrom Ferozepore; and I shall never forget the agony of mind of one of\r\nour gourmands when one day it was reported that the sheep had all been\r\ncarried off by the enemy when grazing in the rear of the canal. I had\r\nalso purchased 100 dozen of ale at Umballah for the use of the mess, and\r\nthis being noised abroad in the camp, we were visited by several thirsty\r\nsouls from other regiments, who, less fortunate than ourselves, had\r\nneglected furnishing themselves with this tempting beverage. It was a\r\npleasure to us to minister to their wants, though I need hardly say that\r\nthe stock lasted but a short time, from the numerous calls made on it.\r\n\r\n_July 17_.--General Reed, who had taken command of the army on the death\r\nof Sir Henry Barnard, resigned his position on July 17 in consequence\r\nof sickness and the infirmities of old age. He was succeeded by\r\nGeneral Wilson, of the Artillery, an officer who had already greatly\r\ndistinguished himself, and under whom the siege was eventually brought\r\nto a successful conclusion.\r\n\r\n_July 18_.--For three days after the last sortie the enemy were\r\nsingularly quiet, quarrelling amongst themselves, as it was reported,\r\nand disputing as to what portion of their army was to lead the next\r\nsortie. However, on July 18, they again made another attempt upon the\r\nSabzi Mandi and the ridge at Hindoo Rao's.\r\n\r\nThe force sent to dislodge them was under command of Colonel Jones, of\r\nthe 60th Rifles, who made his arrangements with singular judgment and\r\ntact, and insisted on a regular formation being kept by the troops,\r\ninstead of the desultory style of action in vogue during previous\r\nsorties. There was, however, some very hard fighting in the gardens and\r\nserais, where we were received by a storm of bullets; but the men being\r\npersuaded to keep well under cover, the losses were not very serious,\r\nthe casualties amounting in all to about ninety officers and men.[2] The\r\nenemy, as usual, suffered severely, more especially from the fire of our\r\nfield-guns, which mowed them down when collected in groups of two and\r\nthree hundred together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM THE SMALL PICKET, SABZI MANDI, LOOKING TOWARDS\r\nKISHENGANJ.]\r\n\r\nI was amused on this day, as well as on previous sorties, by seeing the\r\neagerness with which the soldiers, European, Sikh, and Goorkha, rifled\r\nthe bodies of the slain sepoys. These last had plundered the city\r\ninhabitants of all they could find in money and jewels, and having no\r\nplace of safety (from the anarchy which prevailed in Delhi) in which to\r\ndeposit their loot, they one and all invariably carried their treasure\r\nabout with them, concealed in the kammerbund folds of muslin or linen\r\nrolled round the waist. On the fall of a mutineer, a rush would be made\r\nby the men to secure the coveted loot, a race taking place sometimes\r\nbetween a European and one of our native soldiers as to who should\r\nfirst reach the body. The kammerbund was quickly torn off and the money\r\nsnatched up, a wrangle often ensuing among the men as to the division of\r\nthe booty. In this manner many soldiers succeeded, to my knowledge,\r\nin securing large sums of money; one in particular, a Grenadier of my\r\nregiment, after killing a sepoy, rifled the body, and, returning in\r\ngreat glee to where I was standing, showed me twenty gold mohurs,\r\nworth £32 sterling. It was a most reprehensible practice, but almost\r\nimpossible entirely to prevent, for in the loose order of fighting\r\nwhich generally prevailed, the men did not break from their ranks to\r\naccomplish their purpose, but often, in isolated groups of two and\r\nthree, were separated at times a short distance from the rest of the\r\ncombatants.\r\n\r\nThe General, we heard, was loud in his praise of the manner in which\r\nColonel Jones conducted the operations on this day; after the action\r\nalso, he withdrew his men in perfect order, allowing no straggling--a\r\ngreat contrast to our former usual style when returning to camp after\r\nthe repulse of a sortie.\r\n\r\nThis was the last action of any consequence fought in the open at the\r\nSabzi Mandi Gardens. The ground in front of the picket was soon\r\nafter cleared, and during future attacks our men remained behind the\r\nbreastworks and entrenchments which had been thrown up, and by a steady\r\nfire soon drove back any rebels who were foolhardy enough to come within\r\nrange.\r\n\r\nIt speaks well for the prowess of the mutineers, and proves that we had\r\nno contemptible foe to deal with, that so many sorties and attacks were\r\nmade by them during the siege. They amounted in all to thirty-six--all\r\nof these being regularly organized actions and assaults--besides\r\ninnumerable others on isolated pickets and advanced posts. They seldom\r\ncame to close quarters with our men, and then only when surprised; but\r\nnothing could exceed their persistent courage in fighting almost every\r\nday, and, though beaten on every occasion with frightful loss, returning\r\nover and over again to renew the combat.\r\n\r\n_July 19_.--The succeeding days from July 19 to 23 were days of quiet,\r\nwith the exception of the usual artillery duel. We took our turn at\r\npicket duty with the other regiments, one day at the Metcalfe house and\r\nstables, and on another at the Sabzi Mandi.\r\n\r\n_July 23_.--On the morning of the 23rd the insurgents, for the first\r\ntime since the previous month, made a sortie on our left, emerging from\r\nthe Kashmir Gate with infantry and field-guns. With the latter they\r\noccupied Ludlow Castle, a ruined house midway between the Flagstaff\r\nTower and the Kashmir Gate. Then they opened fire on the left of the\r\nridge, and moving about continually amongst the trees and buildings,\r\nwere well sheltered from our batteries, which were unable to make good\r\npractice. The rebels also showed at the Metcalfe picket, attacking at\r\nthe same time with their infantry; and becoming emboldened by receiving\r\nno opposition from us, the greater part of their force advanced nearer\r\nand nearer to the ridge, till they were seen distinctly from the Mosque\r\nbattery.\r\n\r\nTo punish their temerity, a force of all arms was sent out from camp\r\nunder Brigadier Showers, with the intention of attacking their right\r\nflank. We moved up a deep gorge, and coming on them by surprise, forced\r\nthem to remove their guns, which quickly limbered up and made for the\r\ncity. There was a great deal of skirmishing in the gardens and ruined\r\nhouses before the infantry followed the example of their comrades; but\r\nthe fight was not nearly so severe as during the sorties on the right,\r\nnor did the enemy suffer any very great loss. On our side, we had in all\r\nfifty officers and men killed and wounded.[3]\r\n\r\nAgain for some days the enemy made no movement, and the weather also\r\nholding up for a time, some sport was inaugurated in the camp. The men\r\nmight be seen amusing themselves at various games, while the officers\r\nactually got up an impromptu horse-race.\r\n\r\nThis, however, was not to last long, and on July 31 we were again on the\r\nalert from the report that several thousands of rebels, with thirteen\r\nguns and mortars, were making for the open country to the right rear of\r\nour camp.\r\n\r\nA force under Major Coke was sent out to watch their movements, and also\r\nto convoy a large store of treasure and ammunition coming down to us\r\nfrom the Punjab. The convoy arrived safe on the morning of August 1, and\r\nthe rain falling heavily on that day, making the ground impassable for\r\nguns, the insurgent force, which had moved to our rear, broke up their\r\ncamp and retired towards Delhi.\r\n\r\nThe 1st of August was the anniversary of a great Mohammedan festival\r\ncalled the \"Bakra Id,\" and for some time there had been rumours of a\r\ngrand sortie in honour of the event.\r\n\r\nMorning and afternoon passed, and we began to think the enemy had given\r\nup their purpose, when about sunset firing began at the right pickets.\r\nThe mutineers returning from our rear had met an equal number, which\r\nhad sallied from the city, at the suburb of Kishenganj, and the forces,\r\njoining together, moved forward and attacked the whole right of the\r\nridge and the pickets in that quarter.\r\n\r\nLoudly the bugles sounded the alarm all over the camp, and in a very\r\nshort time every available man was mustered, and the troops were hurried\r\nforward to reinforce the breastworks at Hindoo Rao's house and on each\r\nside.\r\n\r\nThere had been only one actual night-attack since the beginning of the\r\nsiege, and that took place to the rear; it therefore naturally occurred\r\nto the officers in command that this assault by the enemy with such vast\r\nnumbers would require all our efforts to prevent being turned, thus\r\nimperilling the safety of the camp.\r\n\r\nThe action had commenced in earnest when we arrived on the ridge, and\r\nthe brave defenders of Hindoo Rao's house were holding their own against\r\nenormous odds. Masses of infantry with field-guns swarmed in our front,\r\nyelling and shouting like demons while keeping up a steady fire.\r\n\r\nDarkness came on--a lovely night, calm and clear without a cloud in the\r\nsky. The batteries on both sides kept up a terrific cannonade; and our\r\nmen, effectually concealed behind the earth-works, poured incessant\r\nvolleys of musketry into the enemy. The roar and din exceeded anything I\r\nhad ever heard before, and formed one continuous roll, while all around\r\nthe air was illumined by a thousand bright flashes of fire, exposing\r\nto our view the movements of the rebels. They had also thrown up\r\nbreastworks at no great distance to our front, from behind which they\r\nsallied at intervals, returning, however, quickly under cover when our\r\nfire became too hot for them. And in this manner, without a moment's\r\nintermission, the combat continued all night long, with no advantage to\r\nthe assailants, and with few casualties on our side.[4]\r\n\r\n_August 2_.--Morning broke without any cessation in the firing; and it\r\nwas not till ten o'clock that the rebels, seeing how futile were all\r\nefforts, began to retire. Some few still kept up the firing; but at\r\n2 p. m. all was quiet, and our sadly harassed soldiers were enabled to\r\nobtain some rest after seventeen hours' fighting. Nothing could have\r\nsurpassed the steadiness of the men and the cool manner in which they\r\nmet the attacks of the enemy, remaining well under cover, and only\r\nshowing themselves when the rebels came close up. Our casualties during\r\nthose long hours only amounted to fifty killed and wounded, thus proving\r\nthe judgment of the General in ordering the men to remain behind the\r\nearthworks, and not to advance in pursuit unless absolutely necessary.\r\nTwo hundred dead bodies were counted in front of the entrenchments, and\r\ndoubtless during the darkness many more were carried off by the enemy.\r\n\r\nAfter the severe lesson they had received the rebels remained inactive\r\nfor some days, very few shots even being fired from the walls. We learnt\r\nthat the late grand attack had been made by the Neemuch and part of the\r\nGwalior and Kotah insurgents who had mutinied at those places not long\r\nbefore. This accounted for the stubbornness of the assault, it being the\r\ncustom, when reinforcements arrived, to send them out at once to try\r\ntheir mettle with the besiegers.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of General Wilson's accession to the command of the army,\r\nand the stringent orders issued by him for the maintenance of order and\r\ndiscipline both in camp and on picket became more and more apparent\r\nevery day. All duties were now regulated and carried out with the utmost\r\nprecision; each regiment knew its allotted place in case of a sortie,\r\nand the officers on picket had to furnish reports during their term of\r\nduty, thereby making them more attentive to the discipline and care of\r\ntheir men. In the matter of uniform, also, a great and desirable change\r\nwas made. Many corps had become quite regardless of appearance, entirely\r\ndiscarding all pretensions to uniformity, and adopting the most\r\nnondescript dress. One in particular, a most gallant regiment of\r\nEuropeans which had served almost from the beginning of the siege,\r\nwas known by the sobriquet of the \"Dirty Shirts,\" from their habit of\r\nfighting in their shirts with sleeves turned up, without jacket or coat,\r\nand their nether extremities clad in soiled blue dungaree trousers.\r\n\r\nThe army in general wore a cotton dress, dyed with _khaki rang_, or dust\r\ncolour, which at a distance could with difficulty be seen, and was far\r\npreferable to white or to the scarlet of the British uniform. The enemy,\r\non the contrary, appeared entirely in white, having soon discarded the\r\ndress of their former masters; and it was a pretty sight to see them\r\nturning out of the gates on the occasion of a sortie, their arms\r\nglittering, pennons flying, and their whole appearance presenting a gay\r\ncontrast to the dull, dingy dress of their foes.\r\n\r\n_August 5_.--On August 5 an attempt was made by our Engineers to blow up\r\nthe bridge of boats across the Jumna, and some of us went to the top of\r\nthe Flagstaff Tower to see the result.\r\n\r\nTwo rafts filled with barrels of powder and with a slow match in each\r\nwere sent down the river, starting from a point nearly a mile up the\r\nstream. We saw them descending, carried down slowly by the flood, one\r\nblowing up half a mile from the bridge. The other continued its course,\r\nand was descried by some mutineers on the opposite bank, who sent off\r\nmen to the raft on _massaks_ (inflated sheep-skins). It was a perilous\r\ndeed for the men, but without any delay they made their way to the raft,\r\nput out the fuse, and towed the engine of destruction to shore. A most\r\nignominious failure, and the attempt was never repeated, the bridge\r\nremaining intact to the last.\r\n\r\n_August 6_.--At 7 a. m. on August 6 the alarm again sounded, and we\r\nremained accoutred in camp for some hours, but were not called to the\r\nfront on that day. A large party of the enemy's cavalry--more, it must\r\nbe supposed, in a spirit of bravado than anything else--charged up the\r\nroad towards the Flagstaff Tower, waving their swords and shouting,\r\n\"Din! din!\" A battery was brought to bear on them, and this, with a\r\nvolley or two of musketry, soon sent them to the right about, galloping\r\noff and disappearing amongst the trees, after leaving some dead on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe enemy's infantry also harassed the pickets on the right flank,\r\ncausing some casualties, and their artillery fire was kept up all day,\r\nthe guns in the new Kishenganj battery almost enfilading the right of\r\nour position. No efforts on our part could silence the fire from this\r\nplace, and it remained intact, a constant source of annoyance, to the\r\nend of the siege.\r\n\r\nThe numerous cavalry of the enemy might have caused us a vast amount\r\nof trouble had they been properly led, or behaved even as well as the\r\ninfantry and artillery. But there seemed to be little dash or spirit\r\namongst them, and though they made a brave show, emerging from the gates\r\nin company with the rest of their forces, waving swords and brandishing\r\nspears, they took care to keep at a respectful distance from our fire,\r\ntheir only exploit, as far as I can remember, being that on July 9, when\r\n100 horsemen charged into the rear of our camp.\r\n\r\nFrom the 8th to the 11th there were constant attacks on all the pickets,\r\nand the artillery fire on both sides was almost unceasing. The enemy\r\nbrought out some guns by the Kashmir Gate and shelled the Metcalfe\r\npickets, their skirmishers advancing close to our defences with shouts,\r\nand harassing the men day and night, though with small loss on our side.\r\nThey also made the approach to the pickets for relief so perilous that\r\nat early morn of the 12th a large force, under Brigadier Showers, was\r\ndetailed to drive the rebels into the city. My regiment furnished twenty\r\nmen, under an officer,[5] on this occasion.\r\n\r\n_August 12_.--We attacked them at dawn, taking them completely by\r\nsurprise, and capturing all their guns, four in number. The 1st\r\nFusiliers and Coke's Rifles behaved most gallantly, and bore the\r\nbrunt of the fight, losing half the number of those killed and\r\nwounded--namely, 110. The enemy's casualties amounted to upwards of 300,\r\nand they left many wounded on the ground, who were shot and bayoneted\r\nwithout mercy. This signal chastisement had the effect of cowing them\r\nfor a time, and the pickets on the left were unmolested for the future,\r\nsave by occasional shots from the city batteries.\r\n\r\n_August 14_.--August 14 was quiet, the enemy giving us a respite and\r\nscarcely firing a gun, though they must have known of the welcome\r\nreinforcements we had received that morning. These consisted of nearly\r\n3,000 men, of which number more than 1,100 were Europeans.\r\n\r\nThis force, under command of General Nicholson, comprised the 52nd\r\nRegiment, our left wing from Ferozepore, some Mooltani Horse, 1,200\r\nSikhs and Punjabees, and a battery of European artillery. The\r\nreinforcements brought up the Delhi Field Force to more than 8,000\r\neffectives, while of sick and wounded we had the frightful number of\r\nnearly 2,000 in camp, many more having been sent away to Umballah.\r\n\r\nBut what added most to our strength was the presence amongst us of the\r\nhero John Nicholson, he who has been since designated as the \"foremost\r\nman in India.\" Young in years, he had already done good service in the\r\nPunjab wars, and was noted not only for his striking military talent,\r\nbut also for the aptitude he displayed in bringing into subjection and\r\nruling with a firm hand the lawless tribes on our North-West Frontier.\r\nMany stories are told of his prowess and skill, and he ingratiated\r\nhimself so strongly amongst a certain race that he received his\r\napotheosis at their hands, and years afterwards was, and perhaps to this\r\nday is, worshipped by these rude mountaineers under the title of \"Nikul\r\nSeyn.\" Spare in form, but of great stature, his whole appearance and\r\nmien stamped him as a \"king of men.\" Calm and self-confident, full of\r\nresource and daring, no difficulties could daunt him; he was a born\r\nsoldier, the idol of the men, the pride of the whole army. His\r\nindomitable spirit seemed at once to infuse fresh vigour into the force,\r\nand from the time of his arrival to the day of the assault Nicholson's\r\nname was in everyone's mouth, and each soldier knew that vigorous\r\nmeasures would be taken to insure ultimate success.\r\n\r\nWe were freed from attack for some days, and the only event of\r\nimportance was a raid made by the enemy's horsemen in the direction of\r\nRohtak. They were followed by that great irregular leader Hodson, who\r\nsucceeded, with small loss, in cutting up some thirty of their number,\r\nhis own newly-raised regiment and the Guide Cavalry behaving admirably.\r\n\r\n_August 19_.--On August 19 a noteworthy incident occurred at the Sabzi\r\nMandi picket. A woman dressed in the native costume, and attended by an\r\nAfghan, walked up to the sentries at that post, and on approaching the\r\nmen, threw herself on her knees, thanking God in English that she was\r\nunder the protection of British soldiers. The honest fellows were\r\ngreatly taken aback, and wondered who this could be dressed in native\r\ncostume, speaking to them in their own language. She was brought before\r\nthe officer commanding the picket, when it transpired that she was a\r\nEurasian named Seeson, the wife of a European road sergeant. During the\r\noutbreak on May 11 at Delhi her children had been slain before her eyes\r\nand she herself badly wounded, escaping, however, from the murderers\r\nin a most providential manner, and finding shelter in the house of a\r\nfriendly native, who had succoured her ever since. By the aid of the\r\nAfghan, and disguised as an _ayah_, or nurse, she had passed through\r\nthe gates of the city that morning, eventually finding her way to the\r\npicket. We had one lady in camp, the wife of an officer of native\r\ninfantry, and to her kindly charge the poor creature was consigned,\r\nliving to the end of the siege in Mrs. Tytler's tent, and being an\r\nobject of curiosity as well as of pity to the whole force.\r\n\r\nThe enemy, lately, had caused great annoyance by firing at the ridge\r\n32-pound rockets, a large store of which they had found in the magazine,\r\nand as they were unused to discharging these dangerous missiles, the\r\nrockets at first, by their rebound, inflicted more damage on the rebels\r\nthan on us; but, gaining experience through long practice, they every\r\nevening and during part of the night fired them at the ridge, one or two\r\nfalling right amongst the tents in camp.[6]\r\n\r\nA battery also was erected about this time on the opposite bank of the\r\nJumna, at a distance of some 2,000 yards from the Metcalfe pickets, and\r\nthis was served so well that not only were the outposts in considerable\r\ndanger from the fire, but the camp of one of our native regiments on the\r\nextreme left, and below the Flagstaff Tower, was shifted in consequence\r\nof the enemy's shells falling in their midst.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that the rebels put forth their whole strength and\r\nused every means at their disposal to harass and annoy us. Like a swarm\r\nof hornets, they attacked us in every direction, first in one quarter\r\nand then in another; but no effort of theirs affected in the smallest\r\ndegree the bulldog grip of the British army on the rebellious city.\r\nReports were rife that the King had sent to propose terms to the\r\nGeneral, and that the answer was a cannonade directed on the walls by\r\nall our batteries; also that their ammunition was falling short; but\r\nthese, with other silly rumours, were merely the gossip of the camp, and\r\nwere not credited by the bulk of the army.\r\n\r\n_August_ 24.--Again, a very large body of mutineers, numbering, it was\r\nsaid, 9,000 men, with thirteen guns, left the city on August 24. They\r\nwere seen from the ridge for hours trooping out of the Lahore and Ajmir\r\nGates, and proceeding far to our right rear. Their intention, no doubt,\r\nwas to cut off the large siege-train and munitions of war on their way\r\ndown to us from the arsenal at Ferozepore.\r\n\r\n_August_ 25.--A force was at once detailed, under command of the gallant\r\nNicholson, to intercept the enemy and, if possible, to bring them to\r\nbattle. Long before daylight on the morning of August 25 we paraded,\r\ncavalry, infantry, and three batteries of Horse Artillery, or eighteen\r\nguns, numbering in all nearly 2,500 men.\r\n\r\nAt six o'clock the march began, and leaving the Grand Trunk road a short\r\ndistance from the rear of our camp, we made across country to a town\r\nnamed Nanglooi, distant six miles. The men were in high spirits\r\nnotwithstanding the difficulties we had to encounter in traversing a\r\nroute wellnigh impassable from the recent rains, and ankle-deep in mud.\r\nTwo broad swamps also had to be crossed, the soldiers wading waist-high\r\nin the water, and carrying their ammunition-pouches on their heads.\r\nThree hours and more were passed before we arrived at the village, and\r\nhere information reached the General that the enemy were posted twelve\r\nmiles distant, at a place named Najafgarh.\r\n\r\nThe march was at once resumed, and, floundering in the mud, the\r\nartillery horses especially with great labour dragging the guns through\r\nthe morass which extended nearly all the way, we arrived at about four\r\no'clock on the banks of a canal in full view of the enemy's position.\r\n\r\nThis had been chosen with great judgment, and presented a formidable\r\nappearance, stretching about a mile and a half from the canal bridge on\r\nthe extreme right to a large serai on the left in the town of Najafgarh.\r\nNine guns were posted between the bridge and the serai, with four more\r\nin the latter building, all protected by entrenchments with parapets and\r\nembrasures.\r\n\r\nThe troops crossed the canal by a ford, and formed up in line of battle\r\non the opposite side, facing the town of Najafgarh, and about 900 yards\r\nfrom the serai, the infantry in two lines, ourselves and the 1st Bengal\r\nFusiliers in front, with artillery and cavalry on each flank.\r\n\r\nWhen we were halted, Nicholson came to the front and, addressing the\r\nregiments of European infantry, spoke a few soul-stirring words, calling\r\non us to reserve our fire till close to the enemy's batteries, and then\r\nto charge with fixed bayonets. He was answered with a cheer, and the\r\nlines advanced across the plain steady and unbroken, as though on\r\nparade.\r\n\r\nThe enemy had opened fire, and were answered by our guns, the infantry\r\nmarching with sloped arms at the quick step till within 100 yards, when\r\nwe delivered a volley. Then the war-cry of the British soldiers was\r\nheard, and the two regiments came to the charge, and ran at the double\r\ntowards the serai.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Gabbett of my regiment was the first man to reach the\r\nentrenchment, and, passing through an embrasure, received a bayonet\r\nthrust in the left breast, which stretched him on the ground. The men\r\nfollowed, clearing everything before them, capturing the four guns in\r\nthe serai, bayoneting the rebels and firing at those who had taken to\r\nflight at our approach. Then, changing front, the whole force swept\r\nalong the entrenchment to the bridge, making a clean sweep of the enemy,\r\nwho turned and fled, leaving the remaining nine guns in our hands.\r\n\r\nOur Horse Artillery, under Major Tombs--never better served than in this\r\naction--mowed down the fugitives in hundreds, and continued following\r\nand firing on them till darkness set in. The cavalry also--a squadron of\r\nthe gallant 9th Lancers, with the Guides and Punjabees--did their share\r\nof work, while the European infantry were nobly supported by the corps\r\nof Punjab Rifles, who cleared the town of the sepoys.\r\n\r\nThe battle had lasted a very short time, and after dark we bivouacked on\r\nthe wet ground in the pouring rain, completely exhausted from our long\r\nmarch and subsequent fighting, and faint from want of food, none of\r\nwhich passed our lips for more than sixteen hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NOTE.--MAJOR RAINBY COMMANDED THE 61ST REGIMENT IN THIS\r\nENGAGEMENT.]\r\n\r\n[From Lord Roberts' \"Forty-one Years in India.\" By kind permission.]\r\n\r\nStill, the day's work was not over. A village to the rear was found to\r\nbe occupied by the enemy, and the Punjab Rifles were ordered to take\r\nit. They met with a most obstinate resistance, their young commander,\r\nLumsden, being killed. The General then sent part of my regiment to\r\ndislodge the rebels, but we met with only partial success, and had one\r\nofficer, named Elkington, mortally wounded, the enemy evacuating the\r\nplace during the night.\r\n\r\nWe passed the night of the 25th in the greatest discomfort. Hungry and\r\nwet through, we lay on the ground, snatching sleep at intervals. Poor\r\nGabbett died of internal haemorrhage soon after he received his wound,\r\nand his death deprived the regiment of one of its best and bravest\r\nofficers, and me of a true friend. He had shared my tent on the march\r\ndown and during the whole campaign, a cheery, good-hearted fellow, and\r\none who had earned the respect of officers and the love of his men. The\r\nGeneral was particularly struck with his bravery, and with feeling heart\r\nwrote a letter to Gabbett's mother, saying he would have recommended her\r\nson for the Victoria Cross had he survived the action.\r\n\r\nYoung Elkington also received his death-wound at the night-attack on the\r\nvillage. He was quite a stripling, being only eighteen years old, and\r\nhad joined the regiment but a few months before. His was one of those\r\nstrange cases of a presentiment of death, many of which have been well\r\nauthenticated in our army. On looking over his effects, it was found\r\nthat he had written letters to his nearest relations on the night before\r\nmarching to Najafgarh; and he had also carefully made up small parcels\r\nof his valuables and trinkets, with directions on them to whom they were\r\nto be delivered in case of his being killed next day. It was noticed,\r\ntoo, that he was unusually quiet and reserved, never speaking a word\r\nto anyone on the march, though when the action began he behaved like a\r\ngallant soldier, giving up his young life in the service of his country.\r\n\r\n_August_ 26.--On the morning of August 26 we marched back to camp,\r\narriving there before sundown, and were played in by the bands of the\r\ntwo regiments, while many soldiers, native as well as European, lined\r\nthe road and gave us a hearty cheer.\r\n\r\nOur casualties at the action of Najafgarh amounted to twenty-five\r\nofficers and men killed and seventy wounded. The enemy left great\r\nnumbers of dead in the entrenchments and on the plain, their loss being\r\ncomputed at 500 killed and wounded; but this, I fancy, is much below\r\nthe mark, for our artillery fire was very destructive, and the cavalry\r\ncommitted great havoc amongst the host of fugitives. The battle of the\r\n25th was the most brilliant and decisive since that of Badli-ki-Serai on\r\nJune 8. All the guns, thirteen in number, were captured, and the enemy's\r\ncamp, ammunition, stores, camels and bullocks were taken. Would that\r\nwe had met the insurgents oftener in the open in this manner! But the\r\nrascals were too wary, and had too great a dread of our troops to face\r\nthem in a pitched encounter.\r\n\r\nDuring the absence of Nicholson's small force the enemy had attacked all\r\nthe pickets, and kept up a heavy cannonade from the walls, causing us a\r\nloss of thirty-five men. It was their impression that the camp had been\r\nleft almost bare and defenceless by the withdrawal of so large a force;\r\nbut they were quickly undeceived, and were met at each point of assault\r\nby a galling fire from our men.\r\n\r\nFor many nights after August 26 our right pickets were constantly\r\nharassed by the rebels, who also shelled Hindoo Rao's house from the\r\ncity and Kishenganj batteries. Our sappers, too, found it not only\r\ndifficult, but dangerous, to work in the advanced trenches below the\r\nridge, being always met by a murderous musketry from the enemy's\r\nsharpshooters, who fired down behind breastworks. It was resolved,\r\ntherefore, on August 30, to drive them out from their cover, and on\r\ntwo or more occasions this was performed by the Goorkhas and the 60th\r\nRifles, who, as usual, fighting together and supporting each other, took\r\nthe breastworks in gallant style. Our Engineers were then enabled\r\nto continue their operations in the trenches preparatory to making\r\napproaches towards the city walls, and constructing the batteries for\r\nthe siege-train, now daily expected.\r\n\r\nThe Flagstaff Tower, as I have already mentioned in a former part of my\r\nnarrative, was the chief rendezvous of officers when not on duty. About\r\nthis time I went to the top of the tower in company with one of my\r\nregiment, when an amusing incident occurred.\r\n\r\nWe were watching the batteries playing on each side, when a tall Afghan,\r\narmed to the teeth, appeared at the top of the steps, and was about to\r\nset foot on the enclosed space under the flagstaff. A sentry was always\r\nstationed there, and on this occasion it happened to be a sturdy little\r\nGoorkha, one of the Kumaon battalion. On the approach of the Afghan he\r\nimmediately came to the charge, and warned him that none but European\r\nofficers were allowed on the top of the tower. The Afghan laughed,\r\nand then, looking with contempt at the diminutive sentry, a dwarf in\r\ncomparison with himself, he attempted to push aside the bayonet. Losing\r\nall patience, the Goorkha at this threw down his musket, and drawing his\r\n_kukri_, the favourite weapon of his race, he rushed at the Afghan with\r\nup-lifted blade. This was too much for our valiant hero, who quickly\r\nturned tail, and disappeared down the circular staircase, the Goorkha\r\nfollowing him at a short distance. On his return he picked up the\r\nmusket, and seeing us laughing, the frown on his face turned into the\r\nmost ludicrous expression of good-humour I had ever seen, and he burst\r\nout into a fit of laughter which lasted some minutes. He told us that he\r\nand the other Goorkhas of his regiment thought nothing of the bravery of\r\nthe Afghan soldiers, some 100 of whom were on our side at Delhi; and he\r\nspoke truly.\r\n\r\nThese men, all cavalry, superbly mounted, dressed in chain armour, and\r\ncarrying arms of every description, had been sent down ostensibly as a\r\nreinforcement to us by their Ameer, Dost Mohammed Khan of Kabul, but\r\nreally as spies to watch our movements, and report the state of affairs\r\nto their chief. They made a great display about the camp, but I never\r\nheard of their meeting the enemy in action during their stay before\r\nDelhi.\r\n\r\nThe last two days of August we had several men killed and wounded in the\r\nforce, and one of our officers, who shared my tent after poor Gabbett's\r\ndeath, received a severe contusion from the bursting of a shell.\r\n\r\nNearly three months had now elapsed since the Siege of Delhi began. We\r\nwere, to all appearance, no nearer to the desired end, and had scarcely\r\ngained one foot of ground nearer to the walls of the city. Moreover,\r\nthere was alarm in the Punjab owing to a reported disaffection among the\r\nSikh population, who, it is said, were beginning openly to assert that\r\nthe British army was unable to take Delhi. To check this feeling, the\r\nChief Commissioner had urged General Wilson to lose no time in making\r\npreparations for the assault of the city; and thus our expectations beat\r\nhigh at the near approach of the powerful siege-train on its way down\r\nfrom Ferozepore, though we knew there were still before us trials and\r\ndangers to which our former experiences would be as nothing.\r\n\r\nThe weather had now somewhat cleared, but the heat was overpowering,\r\naveraging 98° in the shade of my tent every day. Cholera, too, raged as\r\nbefore, the principal sufferers being ourselves, and the 8th and 52nd\r\nRegiments. To cheer the soldiers, the bands played in camp of an\r\nevening, while some officers and men engaged in sport of various kinds;\r\nbut the angel of Death was hovering over my poor regiment, and few of\r\nus had the heart to join in pastime while our comrades lay stricken and\r\ndying of disease in hospital.\r\n\r\n_September 1_.--A portion of my corps was on duty at the Metcalfe\r\nstable picket on September 1, when a lamentable loss was experienced,\r\nunparalleled in the annals of the siege. The enemy's battery across the\r\nriver had never ceased shelling these pickets, though up to this day it\r\nhad not caused much damage to the defenders.\r\n\r\nShortly after sunrise the men were assembled outside, receiving their\r\ngrog, which was served out to them every morning at an early hour. Some\r\n100 men and officers, beside Sikhs and native attendants, were grouped\r\naround, when a loud hissing sound was heard, and a shrapnel shell, fired\r\nfrom the enemy's battery at the long range of 2,000 yards, exploded a\r\nfew feet in front.\r\n\r\nThe bullets scattered around, and the scene which followed it is almost\r\nimpossible for me to depict. Many threw themselves flat on the ground,\r\nfalling one on top of the other, while groans and cries were heard. One\r\nsoldier fell mortally wounded by my side, and on looking around to\r\ncount up our losses, we found that two of my regiment had been killed\r\noutright, besides six others severely wounded. Two Sikhs and a _bhisti_,\r\nor water-carrier, also met their death, and two doolie-bearers were\r\nwounded--thirteen men in all.\r\n\r\nOne very stout old officer was in the act of having his morning bath\r\nwhen the shell exploded, the _bhisti_ standing at his side and pouring\r\nover him, when squatted on a tent-mallet, his _massuck_ of water.\r\nHe rolled over and over on the ground, presenting such a ludicrous\r\nappearance in his wet, nude state, and covered with earth, that,\r\nnotwithstanding the awful surroundings of the scene, I and others could\r\nnot forbear laughing. The shot had been quite a chance one, but it\r\nproved how deadly was the effect of a shrapnel shell exploding, as this\r\nhad done, only a few feet in front of a large body of men.\r\n\r\n_September 2 and 3_.--The batteries continued exchanging shots during\r\nSeptember 2 and 3, but there were no attacks of any consequence on the\r\npickets, and we had on those days only three men wounded on the right of\r\nour position.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 4th the long-looked-for siege-train reached camp.\r\nIt consisted of twenty-four heavy guns and mortars, and a plentiful\r\nsupply of ammunition and stores. Reinforcements also reached us,\r\namounting to about 400 European infantry and the Belooch battalion, the\r\nlast a most savage-looking lot of men, who, however, did good service,\r\nand fought well. Besides these, a party of Sikh horsemen, in the service\r\nof the Rajah of Jhind--a noble-looking man, who, with his retainers,\r\nhad kept open our communications with the Punjab during the whole\r\nsiege--joined the army, begging as a favour that they might join in the\r\ndangers of the coming assault on the city.\r\n\r\n_September 7_.--September 7 also saw the arrival of Wilde's regiment of\r\nPunjabis, 700 strong, followed the same day by the Kashmir contingent\r\nof 2,200 men and four guns, sent to our assistance by the ruler of that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nI was sitting in my tent with the bandmaster of my regiment, a German\r\nnamed Sauer, when we were saluted with the sound of distant music, the\r\nmost discordant I have ever heard. The bandmaster jumped up from his\r\nseat, exclaiming: \"Mein Gott! vat is dat? No regiment in camp can play\r\nsuch vile music,\" and closing his ears immediately, rushed out of the\r\ntent.\r\n\r\nThe Kashmir troops were marching into camp, accompanied by General\r\nWilson and his staff, who had gone out to meet them, their bands playing\r\nsome English air, drums beating, and colours flying. There was no fault\r\nto be found in the appearance of the soldiers, who were mostly Sikhs and\r\nhill men of good physique; but their ludicrous style of marching, the\r\nstrange outlandish uniform of the men, and the shrill discord of their\r\nbands, created great amusement among the assembled Europeans, who had\r\nnever seen such a travesty on soldiers before. They encamped on our\r\nright flank; but were not employed on active service till the day of\r\nassault, on September 14.\r\n\r\nOn the arrival of the siege-train, no time was lost in making approaches\r\nand parallels, and erecting batteries for the bombardment of Delhi. The\r\ntrench-work had already been begun, and what with covering and working\r\nparties, both of European and native soldiers, and the usual picket\r\nduties, the greater part of the army was continually employed in this\r\narduous work every night and a portion of each day. Nothing could\r\nsurpass the zeal and willing aptitude of the men, who laboured\r\nunceasingly digging trenches and filling sand-bags, all the time, and\r\nmore especially at night, exposed to a galling fire of musketry and\r\nshells.\r\n\r\nThe Engineers, under their able leaders, were unremitting in their\r\nduties; and the young officers of that corps covered themselves with\r\nglory both in these preliminary operations and at the actual assault.\r\n\r\nNo. 1 Battery, to our right front, consisting of ten heavy guns and\r\nmortars, was traced, on the evening of September 7, about 700 yards from\r\nthe Mori bastion. No. 2, to the left front, near Ludlow Castle, and\r\nonly 600 yards from the walls, was completed on the 10th, and contained\r\nnineteen pieces of artillery.\r\n\r\nNo. 4, for ten heavy mortars, and near No. 2, at the Koodsia Bagh, was\r\ncompleted in front of the Kashmir bastion also on that day. And, lastly,\r\nNo. 3, on the extreme left, with six guns at the short distance of 180\r\nyards from the Water bastion, was unmasked behind the Custom-House,\r\nwhich was blown up after the completion of the battery.\r\n\r\nThus, in four days and nights, after incredible exertions on the part of\r\nthe working parties, forty-five heavy guns and mortars were in position,\r\nstrongly entrenched, and ready to silence the fire from the enemy's\r\nbastions and to make breaches in the walls for the assaulting columns.\r\n\r\nThe rebels during all this time plied the covering and working parties\r\nwith shot and shell, bringing out field-guns, which enfiladed the Ludlow\r\nCastle and Koodsia Bagh batteries, and keeping up a sharp musketry fire\r\nfrom an advanced trench they had dug in front of the walls. At the two\r\nlatter places, where the men of my regiment were employed, the fire was\r\nvery galling at times, the guns from the distant Selimgarh Fort, Water,\r\nand Kashmir bastions all concentrating their shots at those batteries\r\nwhilst in process of erection.\r\n\r\nThe nights, fortunately, were clear, and we had plenty of light to\r\nassist us in our work; the men were cheerful and active, never resting\r\nfor a moment in their labours, and receiving in the Field Force orders\r\nthe praise of the General in command.\r\n\r\nWe wondered how it was that the enemy allowed us to occupy the advanced\r\npositions at Ludlow Castle and the Koodsia Bagh without even so much\r\nas a struggle; but it was accounted for by the supposition that they\r\nimagined our attack would be made from the right of our position, where\r\nall the great conflicts had taken place. There they were in strength,\r\nand it was our weakest point; whereas, on the side near the Jumna, we\r\nwere protected from being turned by having the river on our flank,\r\nbetter cover for operations, and, moreover, batteries to silence which\r\nwere less powerful and more difficult of concentration than those\r\nwhich faced us on our right from the city walls and from the suburb of\r\nKishenganj.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: White people.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Lieutenant Pattoun was wounded in the ankle on this\r\noccasion, and a sergeant of the 61st was shot through the head.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Colonel Seton, 35th Native Infantry, was wounded in the\r\nstomach in this affair.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: One man of the 61st Regiment was killed by a round-shot,\r\nwhich in its course also knocked over some sandbags which sent\r\nLieutenant Hutton flying about seven feet.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Lieutenant Yonge.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: On August 7 they blew up one of their own powder factories,\r\nand with it a number of workmen.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nCAPTURE OF THE CITY\r\n\r\nThe actual Siege of Delhi may be said to have commenced on September 7,\r\n1857. All reinforcements that could possibly arrive had reached us with\r\nthe siege-train, and the effective force now available for operations\r\nbefore Delhi consisted of the following troops:\r\n\r\n  European artillery     580\r\n  \"  cavalry             514\r\n  \"  infantry          2,672\r\n -----\r\n  3,766\r\n\r\n  Native artillery       770\r\n  \" cavalry            1,313\r\n  \" infantry           3,417\r\n  Engineers, sappers, miners, etc.  722\r\n -----\r\n  6,222\r\n -----\r\n\r\n  Grand total          9,988\r\n\r\nTo the above must be added the Kashmir contingent of 2,200 men, with\r\nfour guns, and the cavalry of the Jhind Rajah, perhaps 400 more, making\r\nthe full amount of troops employed at the siege 12,588.\r\n\r\nThe seven regiments of European infantry were sadly reduced in numbers,\r\nbeing mere skeletons, the strongest mustering 409 effective rank and\r\nfile, and the weakest only 242. There were also nearly 3,000 men in\r\nhospital, Europeans and natives.\r\n\r\nFrom the most reliable sources the enemy at this period numbered\r\n40,000 men, all trained soldiers of the former regular army, besides\r\nundisciplined armed hordes of fanatics and rabble of the city and\r\nsurrounding country--a formidable disproportion to our scanty force when\r\nit is recollected that they were protected by strong fortifications\r\nmounting upwards of fifty guns, with an unlimited supply of artillery\r\nand munitions of war, and that with their vast numbers they had ample\r\nopportunities of harassing our right flank and rear and cutting off\r\ncommunications up-country.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, political considerations demanded that we should take the\r\noffensive and deal such a blow as would convince the rebels, as well\r\nas those whose loyalty was wavering, that the British arms were\r\nirresistible. Moreover, there was no likelihood of our force being\r\nincreased. So on September 7 General Wilson issued the following address\r\nto his troops:\r\n\r\n\"The force assembled before Delhi has had much hardship to undergo since\r\nits arrival in this camp, all of which has been most cheerfully borne by\r\nofficers and men. The time is now drawing near when the Major-General\r\ncommanding the force trusts that its labours will be over, and it will\r\nbe rewarded by the capture of the city for all its past exertions, and\r\nfor a cheerful endurance of still greater fatigue and exposure. The\r\ntroops will be required to aid and assist the Engineers in the erection\r\nof the batteries and trenches, and in daily exposure to the sun, as\r\ncovering parties.\r\n\r\n\"The artillery will have even harder work than they yet have had,\r\nand which they have so well and cheerfully performed hitherto: this,\r\nhowever, will be for a short period only, and when ordered to the\r\nassault, the Major-General feels assured British pluck and determination\r\nwill carry everything before them, and that the bloodthirsty and\r\nmurderous mutineers against whom they are fighting will be driven\r\nheadlong out of their stronghold, or be exterminated. But to enable\r\nthem to do this, he warns the troops of the absolute necessity of their\r\nkeeping together, and not straggling from their columns. By this can\r\nsuccess only be secured.\r\n\r\n\"Major-General Wilson need hardly remind the troops of the cruel murders\r\ncommitted on their officers and comrades, as well as their wives and\r\nchildren, to move them in the deadly struggle. No quarter should be\r\ngiven to the mutineers; at the same time, for the sake of humanity and\r\nthe honour of the country they belong to, he calls upon them to spare\r\nall women and children that may come in their way.\r\n\r\n\"It is so imperative, not only for their safety, but for the success of\r\nthe assault, that men should not straggle from their column that the\r\nMajor-General feels it his duty to direct all commanding officers to\r\nimpress this strictly upon their men, and he is confident that after\r\nthis warning the men's good sense and discipline will induce them to\r\nobey their officers and keep steady to their duty. It is to be explained\r\nto every regiment that indiscriminate plunder will not be allowed; that\r\nprize agents have been appointed, by whom all captured property will\r\nbe collected and sold, to be divided, according to the rules and\r\nregulations on this head, fairly among all men engaged; and that any\r\nman found guilty of having concealed captured property will be made to\r\nrestore it, and will forfeit all claims to the general prize; he will\r\nalso be likely to be made over to the Provost-Marshal to be summarily\r\ndealt with.\r\n\r\n\"The Major-General calls upon the officers of the force to lend their\r\nzealous and efficient co-operation in the erection of the works of the\r\nsiege now about to be commenced. He looks especially to the regimental\r\nofficers of all grades to impress upon their men that to work in the\r\ntrenches during a siege is as necessary and honourable as to fight in\r\nthe ranks during a battle.\r\n\r\n\"He will hold all officers responsible for their utmost being done to\r\ncarry out the directions of the Engineers, and he confidently trusts\r\nthat all will exhibit a healthy and hearty spirit of emulation and zeal,\r\nfrom which he has no doubt that the happiest results will follow in the\r\nbrilliant termination of all their labours.\"\r\n\r\n_September 7_.--From the night of September 7 to the day of assault\r\nall the artillerymen in the force, European as well as native, were\r\nconstantly employed in the batteries and trenches. Day and night\r\nofficers and men worked with unflagging energy in the advanced\r\nbatteries, with no relief and no cessation from their toil. Few in\r\nnumber, worn out by the excessive fatigues of a three months' campaign,\r\nand enervated by continuous work in the deadliest season of the year,\r\nthese gallant European artillerymen earned during those last days of the\r\nsiege, by their zeal and devotion, the heartfelt thanks of the whole\r\narmy. The old Bengal Artillery have a splendid roll of services,\r\nextending for upwards of 100 years; still, in the annals of that\r\ndistinguished regiment there is no brighter record than their\r\nachievements before Delhi in 1857. The corps has been merged into the\r\nRoyal Artillery, but the ancient name still lives in the memory of those\r\nwho were witnesses of their deeds, and their imperishable renown adds\r\ngreater lustre to the proud motto, _Ubique_, borne by the regiment to\r\nwhich they are affiliated.\r\n\r\nMany officers and men of the cavalry and infantry volunteered for\r\nservice in the batteries when called on by the General. They acquitted\r\nthemselves well, were of great use to the gunners in lightening the\r\narduous duties, and were complimented in orders for the valuable aid\r\nthey had afforded to their companions in arms.[1]\r\n\r\n_September 11_.--The advanced batteries were all completed by the\r\nevening of September 11, when the actual bombardment of the city began.\r\nFor three days and nights previous No. 1 Battery, on the extreme right,\r\nwas severely pounded from the Mori bastion and Kishenganj, but when the\r\nguns got into full play the fire from the former grew gradually weaker\r\nand weaker, till it was completely overpowered. Nos. 2 and 4 Batteries,\r\nbeing nearer to the walls, suffered much from the enemy, and the losses\r\nwere very severe both among the artillery and the covering and working\r\nbodies of infantry.\r\n\r\n_September 11_.--At length, on September 11, the whole of our batteries\r\nopened fire simultaneously on the city bastions and walls. The Kashmir\r\nbastion was soon silenced, the ramparts and adjacent curtains knocked to\r\nfragments, and a large breach opened in the walls. On the extreme left,\r\nat the Custom-House, our battery, as before related, was only 180 yards\r\nfrom the city, and the crushing fire from this, when in full play,\r\nsmashed to pieces the Water bastion, overturned the guns, and made a\r\nbreach in the curtain so wide and practicable that it could be ascended\r\nwith ease.\r\n\r\nFifty guns and mortars were now pouring shot and shell without a\r\nmoment's interval on the doomed city. The din and roar were deafening;\r\nday and night salvos of artillery were heard, roll following roll in\r\nendless succession, and striking terror in the hearts of those who knew\r\nand felt that the day of retribution was at hand.\r\n\r\nStill, though their batteries on the bastions had been wellnigh\r\nsilenced, the rebels stuck well to their field-guns in the open space\r\nbefore the walls; they sent a storm of rockets from one of the martello\r\ntowers, and fired a stream of musketry from the ramparts and advanced\r\ntrenches. Kishenganj, too, made its voice heard, harassing our right and\r\nsweeping the Sabzi Mandi and Hindoo Rao's with its incessant fire.\r\n\r\nDuring the bombardment our casualties amounted to nearly 350 men,\r\nthe enemy causing great loss at No. 2 Battery through the fire of a\r\n3-pounder served from a hole broken in the curtain-wall. This gun was\r\nadmirably directed, and could not be silenced notwithstanding all our\r\nefforts. One officer, looking over the parapet to see the effect of his\r\nfire, was struck by a shot from the \"hole in the wall,\" his head being\r\ntaken completely off, the mutilated trunk falling back amongst the men\r\nat the guns--a ghastly and terrible sight, which filled us who were\r\npresent with horror.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of the bombardment portions of my regiment were on duty\r\nin the batteries and trenches, working at the repair of the parapets and\r\nembrasures occasionally damaged by the enemy's shot, and also taking\r\ntheir share of duty with the advanced and covering parties. These were\r\nharassing and dangerous services, involving great vigilance. We\r\nwere almost always under fire from the enemy; but with the utmost\r\ncheerfulness, and even, I may say, good-humour, the whole of the\r\ninfantry did all in their power to lighten the work of the overtasked\r\nartillerymen: comrades we were, all striving for the accomplishment of\r\none purpose--that of bringing swift and sure destruction on the rebels\r\nwho had for so long a period successfully resisted our arms. So cool and\r\ncollected had the men become that even in the midst of fire from the\r\nadvanced trenches, and while keeping up on our side a brisk fusillade,\r\nthe soldiers smoked their pipes, rude jokes were bandied from one to the\r\nother, and laughter was heard.\r\n\r\nWhen off duty I and others took our station for hours on the ridge, and\r\nsometimes on the top of the Flagstaff Tower. Thence with eager eyes we\r\nwatched the batteries cannonading the walls, and marked the effects of\r\nthe round-shot on the ramparts and bastions. Few of the enemy could be\r\nseen; but every now and then some would show themselves, disappearing\r\nwhen a well-directed shot struck in too close proximity. Cavalry\r\nand infantry at times issued from the gates; but from their hurried\r\nmovements it seemed evident that they were ill at ease, and after a\r\nshort time they returned into the city.\r\n\r\nAt night the scene was, as may be supposed, grand in the extreme. The\r\nspace below was lighted up by continuous flashes and bursts of flame,\r\nthrowing a flood of light among the thick forest of trees and gardens,\r\nwhile shells would burst high over the city, illuminating the spires and\r\ndomes, and bringing into prominence every object around. There was not\r\nonly the roll of the heavy guns and mortars, but the sharp rattle of\r\nmusketry, and the hiss of the huge rocket, as it cut through the air\r\nwith its brilliant light, sounded in our ears.\r\n\r\n_September 12_.--On the 12th the enemy made frequent sorties from the\r\nLahore and Ajmir Gates with bodies of cavalry and foot, while a party of\r\nhorsemen crossed the canal, and made for the right rear of the camp. The\r\nlatter were seen by the Guides and some Punjabi cavalry, who, led by\r\nProbyn and Watson, advanced to meet the enemy. There was a short but\r\nsharp encounter at close quarters, in which thirty rebels were killed,\r\nthe remainder flying at full speed towards the city. The sorties from\r\nthe gates turned out comparatively harmless, and seemed meant only as\r\ndemonstrations to draw out our troops from the cover of the advanced\r\ntrenches. Seeing that the attempt was futile, and resulted only in loss\r\nto themselves, the enemy retreated in confusion, their flight being\r\naccelerated by shell and round-shot from No. 1 Battery, and musketry\r\nfrom our outlying posts.\r\n\r\nA serious loss befell the army on this day in the death of Captain\r\nRobert Fagan, of the Bengal Artillery. This officer, whose heroism made\r\nhis name conspicuous even among the many gallant spirits of the Delhi\r\nField Force, was killed in No. 3 Advanced Battery, a post he had\r\noccupied since September 8, and which was more than any other exposed to\r\nthe enemy's fire. He had served throughout the siege, and was beloved by\r\nhis men, winning the hearts of all, not only by his undaunted behaviour\r\nand cool courage, but also by his kind-hearted and amiable disposition.\r\n\r\nThe approaching day of assault was now the subject of conversation among\r\nofficers and men; for the end was at hand. On September 12 a council of\r\nwar met in General Wilson's tent, at which all the superior officers of\r\nthe army were present. All the arrangements for attack were perfected,\r\nand the position of every brigade and corps was fixed and decided,\r\nthough the day and hour of assault was known to no one, not even to the\r\nGeneral in command.\r\n\r\n_September 13_.--There was no rest for us on the 13th, the last Sunday\r\nwe were destined to pass before the walls of Delhi. The fire of our\r\nheavy cannon increased in violence every hour, and the silence of the\r\nenemy's batteries assured us of the efficacy of the bombardment, and the\r\nspeedy approach of the time when our columns would move to the assault\r\non the city.\r\n\r\nThat night, soon after darkness had set in, four officers of the\r\nEngineers proceeded to examine the two large breaches in the walls made\r\nby the batteries. It was a hazardous duty, exposing them to peril of\r\ntheir lives; but these brave young fellows executed their task in\r\nsafety, and, unobserved by the enemy, few of whom seemed to be keeping\r\nwatch on the ramparts, returned to report the perfect practicability of\r\nthe breaches for escalade.\r\n\r\nThen the General issued his orders for the final assault; and long\r\nbefore midnight each regiment in camp knew its allotted place in the\r\ncoming attack on the city.\r\n\r\nFive storming columns were formed, the position and details of each\r\nbeing as under:\r\n\r\nNo. 1, under Brigadier General Nicholson, consisting of the 75th\r\nRegiment, 1st Bengal Fusiliers, and Punjab Infantry, to storm the breach\r\nat the Kashmir bastion--in all 1,000 men.\r\n\r\nNo. 2 Column, under Brigadier W. Jones (H.M. 61st Regiment), consisting\r\nof H.M. 8th (the King's) Regiment, 2nd Europeans, 4th Sikhs--altogether\r\n850 men to storm the breach near the Water bastion.\r\n\r\nNo. 3, under Colonel Campbell, consisting of the 52nd Regiment, the\r\nKumaon battalion of Goorkhas, and 1st Punjab Infantry--in all 950\r\nmen--to assault the Kashmir Gate after it should be blown in by the\r\nEngineers.\r\n\r\nNo. 5, or the Reserve, under Brigadier Longfield (H.M. 8th Regiment), to\r\nfollow No. 3 by that gate into the city, was composed of the 61st, the\r\nBelooch battalion, 4th Punjab Infantry, and the Jhind troops--altogether\r\n1,300 men, with 200 of H.M. 60th Rifles--to cover the advance of\r\nNicholson's column and to form a reserve.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the above-named columns were under the immediate command of\r\nGeneral Nicholson, on whom devolved all arrangements for carrying out\r\nthe assault on Delhi.\r\n\r\nNo. 4 Column, under Major Reid, the officer in command at Hindoo Rao's\r\nhouse, was formed of part of the 60th Rifles, the Sirmoor battalion\r\nof Goorkhas, detachments from European regiments, and the Kashmir\r\ncontingent. This column was to attack the fortified suburb of\r\nKishenganj, and enter the city by the Lahore Gate, meeting Nos. 1 and 2\r\nColumns at that place.\r\n\r\nThe cavalry brigade, under Colonel Grant, composed of the 9th Lancers,\r\npart of the 6th Carabineers, with Sikh and Punjab cavalry and some\r\nHorse Artillery, took up their position on the right of No. 1 Advanced\r\nBattery, facing the Mori Gate, and within range of Kishenganj. Their\r\nobject was to oppose any attempt to take the storming columns in\r\nflank, to watch the movements of the enemy, and to guard the camp from\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\nTo the convalescents and a small force of cavalry and artillery the\r\nprotection of the camp was confided--a very insufficient guard when it\r\nis considered that the enemy might well, out of their vast numbers, have\r\ndetached part of their horsemen and infantry to harass, if not imperil,\r\nits safety, and that of the many, sick and wounded. As will hereafter be\r\nseen, great danger resulted from the arrangements made in this respect;\r\nand had the enemy, after our unsuccessful attack on Kishenganj on the\r\n14th, but shown a spirit of pluck and daring, it is not too much to\r\naffirm that the camp might have fallen into their hands, and our\r\nsuccesses in the city have thereby been rendered almost nugatory.\r\n\r\nThe night of the 13th was passed by us in a cheerful mood, everyone\r\nhopeful and confident of what the morrow would bring forth. There was\r\na character of determination among the officers and men, a cool,\r\ndeliberate conviction that, under Providence, success would crown our\r\narms, and that vengeance would be done on those who had forfeited their\r\nlives by the cruel massacre of our defenceless women and children.\r\n\r\nSleep visited the eyes of few in camp during the short hours of\r\npreparation for the assault. Fully equipped to turn out at a moment's\r\nnotice, we lay down on our beds waiting for the signal to fall in.\r\nThis came at about three o'clock on the morning of September 14--an\r\nauspicious day, it being the third anniversary of the Battle of the\r\nAlma.\r\n\r\n_September_ 14.--The troops fell in on their respective lines, and,\r\nassembling at the slope of the ridge, the four columns of attack marched\r\nin silence to the Flagstaff Tower. Thence, picking up the men on picket,\r\nwho were all withdrawn from the outlying posts, the force moved by the\r\nroad to the neighbourhood of Ludlow Castle, and close to No. 2 Advanced\r\nBattery. Our movements were entirely concealed from the enemy; the\r\ndarkness which prevailed, and the ample cover from trees, gardens, and\r\nhouses, masking the march of the columns, while the breaching batteries,\r\nwhich had kept up their fire all night long, still continued the\r\nbombardment; nor did they cease till the actual moment when the columns\r\nwere set in motion and took their way to the city.\r\n\r\nJust before sunrise all the dispositions were completed, the gallant\r\nNicholson, under whose orders we were, moving from point to point to\r\nperfect his arrangements. Our artillery fire ceased as if by magic; and\r\na stillness, which contrasted ominously with the former roar and din,\r\nmust have convinced the rebels that something unusual was about to take\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe 60th Rifles with a cheer advanced to the front, and opened out as\r\nskirmishers to the right and left of the Koodsia Bagh. Then followed\r\nNos. 1 and 2 Columns, which, in compact order, issued from their cover,\r\nmaking for the two breaches to be assaulted.\r\n\r\nI was with my regiment in No. 5 Column; and with breathless interest,\r\neach heart aflame with excitement, we watched our comrades marching to\r\nthe attack. Presently the order for No. 3 Column to move forward was\r\ngiven, and at a short interval our own followed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the enemy had descried our movements, and the ramparts and\r\nwalls and also the top of the breaches were alive with men, who poured\r\nin a galling fire on our troops Soon they reached the outer edge of the\r\nmoat, and amidst a perfect hailstorm of bullets, causing great havoc\r\namong our men, the scaling-ladders were let down. The ditch here, 20\r\nfeet deep and 25 feet broad, offered a serious obstacle to the quick\r\nadvance of the assaulting columns; the men fell fast under the withering\r\nfire, and some delay ensued before the ladders could be properly\r\nadjusted. However, nothing daunted, the opposite side was scaled, and,\r\nmounting the escarp, the assailants, with shouts and cheers that could\r\nbe heard above the din of battle, rushed up the two breaches.\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for the charge of the British bayonets, the greater part\r\nof the rebels deserted the walls and bastions and ran pell-mell into the\r\ncity, followed by our men. Some few stood manfully and endeavoured to\r\ncheck the flight of the rest; but they were soon shot or bayoneted, and\r\nthe two columns halted inside the walls.\r\n\r\nAlmost simultaneously with the entrance of our troops into the city, the\r\nKashmir Gate was blown in, and No. 3 Column, followed by No. 5, advanced\r\nalong the covered way and passed into the city. We had only been, met by\r\ndesultory fire from the enemy, which caused few casualties, during our\r\nmarch to the gate; the men were in high spirits, and longed to come to\r\nclose quarters.\r\n\r\nThe episode of the blowing in of the Kashmir Gate of Delhi is too well\r\nknown to require description here;[2] suffice it to say that the deed\r\nwas an act of heroism almost without a parallel in the annals of the\r\nBritish army. In broad daylight, a small band of heroes advanced to\r\nalmost certain death; but with a determination and valour seldom heard\r\nof, after repeated attempts to lay the powder-bags and apply the match,\r\nand losing nearly all their number, killed and wounded, the gate was\r\nblown in, giving free passage to the assaulting columns.\r\n\r\nAll the troops were now assembled at the main guard, in an open space\r\nclose to the Kashmir Gate, and here, as well as the firing from the\r\nenemy would permit, the force re-formed, under the orders of General\r\nNicholson. Nos. 1 and 2 Columns united, and under command of that\r\nofficer moved to their right, advancing along the walls in that\r\ndirection and clearing everything in their way.\r\n\r\nNo. 3 Column now marched into the heart of the city, being guided by Sir\r\nTheophilus Metcalfe, and by a circuitous route made its way towards the\r\nJama Musjid. Soon we lost sight of this force, and then our own work\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\nAdvancing from our first place at the main guard, No. 5 Column pushed\r\nforward to the College Gardens, marching through narrow streets and\r\nlanes, with high houses on each side. But how can I describe that\r\nterrible street-fighting, which lasted without intermission the whole\r\nday? From every window and door, from loopholes in the buildings, and\r\nfrom the tops of the houses, a storm of musketry saluted us on every\r\nside, while every now and then, when passing the corner of a street,\r\nfield-guns, loaded with grape, discharged their contents into the\r\ncolumn. Officers and men fell fast, but this only served to exasperate\r\nthe remainder, who almost without a check reached the College, and,\r\nafter some severe skirmishing, cleared the gardens and houses of the\r\nrebels, and bayoneted all who were found there.\r\n\r\nLeaving a detachment to occupy this post, we passed through more streets\r\nand lanes, ever exposed to the same terrific fire, and after great\r\ntrouble succeeded in taking possession of Colonel Skinner's house and a\r\nlarge building known as the palace of Ahmed Ali Khan.\r\n\r\nIt was now midday, and at the latter place we were joined by No. 3\r\nColumn, which, making its way to the Jama Musjid, met with such a\r\nstrenuous resistance that, after losing many men, and being without\r\npowder with which to blow up the gates of the mosque, it was forced to\r\nretire. The streets, we heard, were alive with men on their line of\r\nroute, and the column had been exposed to incessant fire without any\r\ngood resulting from their undaunted efforts.\r\n\r\nThere was work enough and to spare to clear the streets and houses in\r\nfront and on each side of the Kashmir Gate; and from the time the\r\ntwo columns joined forces till night set in a continuous fight was\r\nmaintained. The system of attack in which we were engaged allowed of no\r\nformation being retained. Isolated groups of men, European and native,\r\nled sometimes by officers, and often without any leaders, roamed through\r\nthe narrow streets, entering houses from which the fire was more than\r\nusually severe, and putting to death without mercy all who were found\r\ninside.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion a party of sepoys and armed rabble emerged from a house\r\nin our front, and were seen by our men, who immediately opened fire.\r\nSoon they were followed by a troop of women yelling and screaming.\r\nKeeping these as a cover for their retreat, the rebels got clear away,\r\nthe soldiers having desisted from firing the moment the women appeared.\r\nThis was a ruse which, I heard from others, was often adopted by the\r\nmutineers, who seemed to know intuitively that their women and children\r\nwere safe from the fire of our men.\r\n\r\nThe deeds of individual daring performed during September 14 were\r\nnumberless, and I was witness of many feats of arms and cool courage\r\nby the rank and file and non-commissioned officers of the different\r\nregiments. A private of my corps, a huge Grenadier Irishman named\r\nMoylan, saved the life of an officer under circumstances which fully\r\nentitled him to the coveted distinction of the Victoria Cross. In one of\r\nthe numerous encounters which took place this officer, leading on a few\r\nmen, turned sharply round the corner of a street, and was met by a force\r\nof sepoys coming from the opposite direction. A shot struck him, and he\r\nwas felled to the ground from the blow of a sword, and would have been\r\nquickly despatched had not Moylan rushed to his rescue. Discharging his\r\nmusket, he shot one of the assailants, and charged with the bayonet.\r\nThis was broken off; and then, with firelock clubbed, he stood over the\r\nprostrate officer, dealing such fearful blows with the weapon--felling\r\nhis foes in every direction--that the sepoys took to their heels, and\r\nMoylan, picking up the wounded officer, brought him to a place of\r\nsafety. He was made a sergeant on the spot by the Colonel, but all\r\nefforts to obtain the Cross for this gallant fellow were unavailing. In\r\nthose days the distinction was but seldom given; probably so many names\r\nwere submitted for the General's consideration that only a few could be\r\napproved, and the application for Moylan was passed by.\r\n\r\nBut though in the latter's case the Victoria Cross was not given, it was\r\nawarded to a surgeon (named Reade) of my regiment on that day. He was\r\never to be found in the thick of the fighting, ministering to the\r\nwounded and cheering on the men. While engaged in his professional\r\nduties, a number of sepoys poured a deadly fire from the far end of a\r\nstreet into the group of wounded of which he was the central figure.\r\nThis was too much for the surgeon, who, drawing his sword, called on\r\nsome men of the regiment close by, and led them in gallant style against\r\nthe enemy, whom he dispersed with great loss, killing two sepoys with\r\nhis own hand. Not only on this occasion, but on several others, the\r\nsurgeon's bravery was most conspicuous, no one grudging him the\r\ndistinction he had so gallantly won.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing so destructive of the morale and discipline of soldiers\r\nas street-fighting, nor can control be maintained except by men of\r\nextraordinary resolution. The veterans of the European regiments\r\ncomposing the Delhi army on the day of assault fully justified their\r\nreputation. Cool and determined, they kept in check the impulsive valour\r\nof the young soldiers, and assisted their officers on various occasions\r\nwhen it became almost impossible to control their ardour. Till late\r\nat night the fighting never ceased; the weary and famished soldiers,\r\nexhausted and worn out from fatigue and exposure, and without a moment's\r\nrest, carried out the work of clearing the streets and houses, exposed\r\nall the time to a fire of musketry, coming chiefly from unseen foes.\r\n\r\nMany lost their lives in the houses, where, entangled in the labyrinth\r\nof roofs, courtyards, and passages, they were shot down by the inmates,\r\nand were found, in several instances days after, with their throats cut\r\nand otherwise mutilated. The hope of finding plunder in these places\r\nalso led many to their doom, and accounted for the large list of missing\r\nsoldiers whose names appeared in the day's casualties.\r\n\r\nAnd now I must pass from our force to record the doings of No. 1 and\r\n2 Columns, under General Nicholson. These, for a long distance, had\r\ncarried all before them, taking possession of the ramparts and bastions\r\nas far as the Kabul Gate, and effectually clearing the streets leading\r\nto the heart of the city. Exposed to a pitiless fire of grape and\r\nmusketry through their whole advance, their loss was very heavy, but,\r\nstill pressing forward, barrier after barrier was taken, the guns on\r\neach bastion, after its capture, being at once turned on the city. Their\r\ngoal was the Burn bastion and the Lahore Gate, and all that men could do\r\nwith their diminished numbers was tried at those points without effect.\r\nThe rebels were in enormous force at these positions; field-guns and\r\nhowitzers poured grape and canister into the assaulting columns, and\r\nmusketry rained on them from the adjoining houses. Time after time\r\nattacks were made, till the sadly harassed soldiers, completely worn\r\nout, were forced to retire to the Kabul Gate and the bastions and\r\nramparts they had already gained.\r\n\r\nIt was in one of these unsuccessful attempts to carry the Lahore Gate\r\nthat Nicholson fell mortally wounded. Ever eager and impetuous, his\r\ndauntless soul led him into the thick of the combat. Spurning danger,\r\nand unmindful of his valuable life, he was in the front, in the act\r\nof encouraging and leading on his men, when the fatal shot laid low a\r\nspirit whose equal there was not to be found in India. He lingered\r\nfor some days in great torment, expiring on September 23, mourned by\r\neveryone in the force, from the General in command to the private\r\nsoldier, all of whom knew his worth, and felt that in the then momentous\r\ncrisis his absence from amongst us could ill be borne. No eulogy can add\r\nto his renown; through his efforts, more than those of any other, Delhi\r\nfell, and he left his unconquered spirit as a heritage for the work\r\nstill to be accomplished in the pacification of India. His name itself\r\nwas a tower of strength in the army. Peerless amongst the brave men of\r\nhis time, to what brilliant destinies might he not have succeeded had\r\nhis young life (he was but thirty-four years old) been prolonged!\r\n\r\nI must now revert to No. 4 Column, under Major Reid, and the attack on\r\nthe strong fortified suburb of Kishenganj. About 100 men of my regiment\r\nwere engaged in this affair; and from the lips of our officers I had a\r\nfull account of the fight and the subsequent retreat.[3]\r\n\r\nThe morning had dawned, and Major Reid waited to hear the signal to\r\ncommence operations--the blowing in of the Kashmir Gate. His force,\r\nnumbering about 1,000 men besides the Kashmir troops, were formed up on\r\nthe Grand Trunk Road, opposite the Sabzi Mandi picket and at the foot of\r\nthe ridge. Now the sun had risen, and still he watched for the signal,\r\nwhen shots in quick succession were heard on the right of the column,\r\nand it became known that the Kashmir contingent, without waiting for\r\norders, had become engaged with the enemy.\r\n\r\nSome men of the 60th Rifles were thrown out as skirmishers, and Major\r\nReid moved with his force in the direction of Kishenganj. Soon they were\r\nstopped by strong breastworks thrown up by the enemy and barring the\r\nroad to the suburb, the rebels being concealed behind these in great\r\nforce, and pouring a heavy fire on our troops when only fifty yards\r\ndistant. A rush was made for the earthworks, which were taken in gallant\r\nstyle; but the want of field-guns was here felt, and the enemy retired a\r\nshort distance amongst the gardens, from which they continued to harass\r\nour troops. The Kishenganj battery also opened fire, and our position\r\nbecame critical in the extreme from the increasing number of the foe,\r\nwho were constantly reinforced, and defied all endeavours to drive them\r\nfrom their cover.\r\n\r\nWhile the struggle was thus raging on the left, the Kashmir troops on\r\nthe extreme right flank had become involved with a large force of the\r\nenemy of all arms, who, no doubt despising the martial qualities of\r\nthese half-disciplined levies, attacked them on all sides with\r\ngreat vigour. Our allies made no stand, and soon became completely\r\ndisorganized, flying at length in headlong rout, with the loss of all\r\ntheir guns. No record was kept of their casualties, but they must have\r\nbeen very severe. For the future they remained unemployed in their camp,\r\nbewailing the loss of their four guns, and were never again engaged with\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nTwo or three days after the capture of Delhi I was wandering, with some\r\nothers, through the streets of the city, when we came upon an officer\r\nand four men of the contingent, who accosted us, asking if we had heard\r\nor seen anything of their lost guns. They seemed in great grief, fearing\r\nthe wrath of the Maharajah of Kashmir when they should arrive home,\r\nleaving the guns behind. With difficulty restraining a laugh, we assured\r\nthem that we could give no information on the subject, and counselled\r\nthem to search among the guns on the bastions near the Lahore and Ajmir\r\nGates. They succeeded eventually in finding two, the others probably\r\nbeing borne off as trophies by the sepoys during the evacuation of\r\nDelhi. The contingent soon afterwards left for Kashmir, but how they\r\nwere received by the Maharajah we never heard, though probably condign\r\npunishment was meted out to those who had actual charge of the guns.\r\n\r\nThe defeat of the Kashmir troops had a most disastrous effect on the\r\nissue of the attack on Kishenganj. Reinforced in great numbers, as I\r\nhave related, the enemy maintained their ground, and our men could make\r\nno impression on them, chiefly from the want of field-guns. Major Reid,\r\nmoreover, was wounded at an early stage of the action, and was carried\r\noff the field. His absence was soon felt in the altered dispositions of\r\nthe force, and the want of a leader to carry out the plans formed by\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe breastworks which had been taken could not be held for want of\r\nsupport, and some confusion resulted, the enemy's artillery from\r\nKishenganj and musketry from the gardens causing great destruction.\r\nMany gallant attempts were made to drive off the rebels, but all were\r\nunavailing; and at length, after losing one-third of its number, the\r\ncolumn fell back in good order to its original starting-point near the\r\nSabzi Mandi, and Kishenganj remained in the hands of the enemy. Had that\r\nposition been taken, and No. 4 Column, according to instructions, pushed\r\non to the Lahore Gate, no good, as it turned out, would have been\r\neffected. Nicholson's columns, as related, had been forced to retire;\r\nthe gate would have remained closed, and possibly the undertaking would\r\nhave resulted in a more serious collapse than the ineffectual attempt on\r\nKishenganj.\r\n\r\nThe presence of a large unconquered force on our right flank also placed\r\nthe camp in imminent danger. It was known--from information received\r\nfrom spies--that it was the enemy's intention, after our failure\r\nto dislodge them from the suburb, to make an attack on the almost\r\nunprotected camp. The danger fortunately passed off, the rebels probably\r\nhaving little heart to join in operations to our rear when they heard\r\nthe news of the signal success of our columns in the city. Still, their\r\npresence at Kishenganj was a standing menace; nor were we completely at\r\nease with regard to the safety of the camp till the 20th, when the city\r\nwas found to be evacuated by the enemy, and our troops immediately took\r\npossession.\r\n\r\nLastly, I must narrate the doings of the Cavalry Brigade. This force,\r\nwith Horse Artillery, was stationed near No. 1 Advanced Battery, under\r\nthe command of Brigadier Hope-Grant, their duty being to guard our\r\nright flank from being turned during the assault on the city. Here they\r\nremained, keeping a watchful lookout for some hours, till orders came\r\nfor the brigade to move towards the walls of Delhi. They halted opposite\r\nthe Kabul Gate, at a distance of 400 yards, and were at once exposed to\r\nthe fire from the bastions, and to musketry from the gardens outside\r\nthe suburbs of Taliwarra and Kishenganj. Our Horse Artillery made good\r\npractice, driving the enemy from their cover and spiking two guns; but\r\nthe exposed situation caused great losses in the cavalry, and they moved\r\nstill further to their front, halting amidst some trees.\r\n\r\nThe enemy now sallied from the gardens as though with the intention\r\nof driving the cavalry in the direction of the Kashmir Gate. The\r\ncircumstances were most critical, when a body of Guide Infantry, coming\r\nup at the time, threw themselves on the rebels, maintaining their place\r\nwith great resolution till help arrived, with a part of the Belooch\r\nbattalion, and the enemy were forced to retire.\r\n\r\nToo much praise cannot be given to the 9th Lancers and Horse Artillery\r\nfor their conduct on this occasion. Exposed for hours to cannonade\r\nand musketry, unable to act from the nature of the ground, they never\r\nflinched from their post, forming a living target to the fire of the\r\nrebels. The same may be said of the Sikh and Punjabi cavalry, who\r\ndisplayed a coolness and intrepidity scarcely, if at all, less\r\nmeritorious than that of their European comrades. Our casualties were\r\nvery severe, the 9th Lancers alone losing upwards of twenty men killed\r\nand wounded.\r\n\r\nAnd now that I have described the operations of each column and portions\r\nof the Delhi army during September 14, it will be necessary to record\r\nthe advantages we had gained. From the Water bastion to the Kabul Gate,\r\na distance of more than a mile, and constituting the northern face\r\nof the fortifications of Delhi, was in our possession, with all the\r\nintervening bastions, ramparts, and walls. Some progress had been made\r\ninto the city opposite, and to the right and left of the Kashmir Gate,\r\nand along the line of walls. The College and its grounds, Colonel\r\nSkinner's house, that of Ahmed Ali Khan, and many other smaller\r\nbuildings were held by the infantry. The enemy's guns on the bastions\r\nhad been turned on to the city, and a constant fire was kept up, the\r\nstreets and lanes being cleared in front, and advanced posts occupied by\r\nour men.\r\n\r\nThese advantages had not been gained without a severe struggle, and a\r\nterrible roll of killed and wounded was the consequence. Our casualties\r\non September 14 amounted to upwards of 1,200 officers and men killed,\r\nwounded, and missing--a loss out of all proportion to the small number\r\nof men engaged, and when the relative forces are considered, far\r\nexceeding that which was suffered by the British army during the assault\r\non the Redan on September 8, 1855. The deadly and destructive nature\r\nof street-fighting was here apparent, and the long-sustained contest,\r\nlasting more than twelve hours, swelled the total loss to the excessive\r\namount recorded. In my regiment alone 100 men were placed _hors de\r\ncombat_, thirty-three being killed; but the other European regiments\r\nsuffered still more in proportion, and especially so those which took\r\npart in the actual assault on the breaches.\r\n\r\nThe native troops fought with the most determined bravery; Sikhs,\r\nPunjabis, and Goorkhas, side by side with their English comrades,\r\npressed into the forefront of the strife, helping in the most material\r\nmanner towards the day's success.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to ascertain the loss sustained by the enemy. Dead\r\nbodies lay thick in the streets and open spaces, and numbers were killed\r\nin the houses; but the greater part of those who fell were no\r\ndoubt carried off by the rebels. In the ardour of the fight many\r\nnon-combatants also lost their lives, our men, mad and excited, making\r\nno distinction.\r\n\r\nThere is no more terrible spectacle than a city taken by storm. All the\r\npent-up passions of men are here let loose without restraint. Roused\r\nto a pitch of fury from long-continued resistance, and eager to take\r\nvengeance on the murderers of women and children, the men in their\r\npitiless rage showed no mercy. The dark days of Badajoz and San\r\nSebastian were renewed on a small scale at Delhi; and during the\r\nassault, seeing the impetuous fury of our men, I could not help\r\nrecalling to my mind the harrowing details of the old Peninsular Wars\r\nhere reproduced before my eyes.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a small amount of looting, the men were too much\r\noccupied with fighting and vengeance to take note of the means of\r\ntemptation which lay within their reach in the untold quantities of\r\nspirits in the stores of the city. Strong drink is now, and has in all\r\nages been, the bane of the British soldier--a propensity he cannot\r\nresist in times of peace, and which is tenfold aggravated when excited\r\nby fighting, and when the wherewithal to indulge it lies spread before\r\nhim, as was the case at Delhi. When and by whom begun I cannot say, but\r\nearly in the morning of the 15th the stores had been broken into, and\r\nthe men revelled in unlimited supplies of drink of every kind. It is a\r\nsad circumstance to chronicle, and the drunkenness which ensued might\r\nhave resulted in serious consequences to the army had the enemy taken\r\nadvantage of the sorry position we were in. Vain were the attempts made\r\nat first to put a stop to the dissipations, and not till orders went\r\nforth from the General to destroy all the liquor that could be found did\r\nthe orgy cease, and the men return crestfallen and ashamed to a sense\r\nof their duties. The work of destruction was carried out chiefly by the\r\nSikhs and Punjabis, and the wasted drink ran in streams through the\r\nconduits of the city.\r\n\r\n_September 15_.--This untoward event considerably hampered the\r\noperations on September 15, and but small progress was made that day\r\ntowards driving the rebels out of Delhi. The artillery and engineers\r\nworked hard at the completion of the batteries on the captured bastions,\r\non which were mounted our own and the enemy's heavy guns; and one for\r\nmortars was erected in the College grounds, which shelled the Palace\r\nand the Fort of Selimgarh. A few houses were taken in advance of our\r\npositions, but no further movement on any large scale was attempted,\r\nowing to the demoralized state of a great portion of the European\r\ninfantry, and, further, to a desire that the troops should obtain some\r\nrest after the unparalleled fatigues and exposure of the previous day.\r\n\r\nReports also spread through the force that the General, feeling his\r\nstrength and means inadequate to hold even the portions of the city in\r\nour possession, meditated an evacuation of the place, and a retirement\r\nto the old camp to await reinforcements. Every consideration must be\r\nmade for one placed in his critical position; and he, no doubt, in his\r\nown mind, felt justified in proposing the step, which, had it been\r\ncarried out, would, in all probability, have ended in the fall of\r\nBritish rule in India. \"In an extraordinary situation extraordinary\r\nresolution is needed,\" was the saying of the Great Napoleon, and to no\r\ncrisis in our history was this dictum more applicable than that at Delhi\r\nin September, 1857. Mutiny and rebellion spread their hydra heads over\r\nthe land, disaffection was rife in the Punjab, our only source of supply\r\nfor operations in the field; and nought could stay the alarming symptoms\r\nsave the complete capture and retention of the great stronghold of\r\nrebellion. It had also been a well-known maxim laid down and carried out\r\nby Clive, Wellesley, Lake, and all the great commanders who had made\r\nour name famous in Hindostan, never to retire before an Eastern foe, no\r\nmatter how great the disparity of numbers; and history tells us that our\r\nsuccesses were due mainly to this rule, while the few reverses we have\r\nsuffered resulted from a timid policy carried out by men whose heart\r\nfailed them in the hour of trial.\r\n\r\nHappily for the Delhi army, and more especially for the English name,\r\nthe counsels of the General in command were overruled by the chief\r\nofficers in the force, and even the gallant Nicholson from his death-bed\r\ndenounced, in language which those who heard it will never forget, the\r\nstep contemplated by his superior officer.\r\n\r\nTowards the evening of the 15th the enemy, becoming emboldened by our\r\ninactivity, attacked the advanced posts along our whole line, and kept\r\nup a sharp musketry fire, more especially on the College compound, while\r\nthe heavy guns at Selimgarh and some at the magazine shelled those\r\ngardens and houses adjacent--even as far as the Kashmir Gate--occupied\r\nby our troops. At 5 p. m. a battery of heavy guns played on the defences\r\nof the magazine, soon crumbling the wall to pieces, and opening out a\r\nlarge breach for assault.\r\n\r\n_September 16_.--My regiment, the 4th Punjab Rifles, and a wing of the\r\nBelooch battalion were detailed as a storming party, and mustering at an\r\nearly hour on the morning of the 16th, we marched to the attack on\r\nthe magazine.[4] This enclosure--a large walled area close to the\r\nPalace--was surrounded by a high curtained wall with towers, the\r\ninterior space being occupied by buildings and containing a park of\r\nartillery and munitions of war. We met with no resistance on our way,\r\nand on approaching the breach saw only a few defenders on the ramparts,\r\nwho opened a fire, which, however, caused little damage. A rush was at\r\nonce made, the men gaining the top of the bridge without difficulty, and\r\nbayoneting some sepoys and firing on the remainder, who fled through the\r\nenclosure and were driven out at the gates on the opposite side. We had\r\nonly about a dozen men killed and wounded, but of the enemy more than\r\n100 lost their lives, being dragged out of the buildings where they had\r\ntaken refuge and quickly put to death. Two hundred and thirty-two guns\r\nfell into our hands, besides piles of shot and shell; in fact, so vast\r\nwas the amount that, although the enemy had been firing from their\r\nbatteries for more than three months, making a lavish use of the stores\r\nat their command, scarcely any impression seemed to have been made on\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThat day and the following night our position in the captured magazine\r\nwas anything but pleasant. The rebels continually harassed us with\r\nshells fired from the Chandni Chauk and near the Palace. Some, more\r\nventuresome than the rest, climbed on ladders to the top of the walls,\r\nplying us with musketry and hand-grenades, while others during the night\r\nmounted the high trees overhanging the enclosure, and with long lighted\r\nbamboos tried to set fire to the thatched buildings and blow up a small\r\nmagazine. These attempts kept us constantly on the alert; and it was\r\nwith great difficulty that we prevented damage being done.\r\n\r\nFighting continued during the day among the other portions of the force,\r\nand Nos. 1 and 2 Columns made further advances among the streets, the\r\nguns and mortars from the bastions throwing shot and shell far into the\r\ncrowded parts of the city. Houses in commanding situations were taken\r\nand made secure from assault by defences of sand-bags. Great judgment\r\nwas shown in these operations, and the losses in consequence were\r\ncomparatively few; but the enemy as yet gave no signs of retreating\r\nfrom Delhi, and our leaders felt that great exertions would still be\r\nnecessary before the city fell entirely into our hands.\r\n\r\n_September 17_.--During the 17th and 18th a constant fire of shells from\r\nupwards of twenty mortars was directed from the magazine and College\r\ngrounds on the Selimgarh Fort and the Palace, those from the bastions\r\nstill firing into a large portion of the city. Skirmishing went on at\r\nthe advanced posts, and a regular unbroken line of communication was\r\nestablished from one end of our pickets to the other.\r\n\r\n_September 18_.--On the 18th my regiment moved from the magazine and\r\ntook up its quarters in the Protestant Church, close to the main guard\r\nand Kashmir Gate, and at no great distance from the northern walls of\r\nthe city. This church had been built by the gallant and philanthropic\r\nColonel Alexander Skinner, C.B., an Eurasian and an Irregular cavalry\r\ncommander of some eminence during the wars in the beginning of the\r\ncentury. He also erected at his own expense a Hindoo temple and a\r\nMohammedan mosque, giving as his reason that all religions were alike,\r\nand that, in his opinion, each one was entitled to as much consideration\r\nas the other.\r\n\r\nThis church in which we were now quartered had been sadly desecrated by\r\nthe rebels and fanatics of the city. They had, in their religious zeal,\r\ntorn down the pulpit and reading-desk, defaced emblems, broken up the\r\npews and the benches, and shattered all the panes of glass, while here\r\nand there inside the building were remains of their cooking-places, with\r\nbroken fragments of utensils. The walls, too, had suffered much from the\r\neffects of our bombardment from September 11 to 14, the church being\r\nin the line of fire directed on the bastions. Many, no doubt, would\r\nconsider it a sacrilege to quarter English troops in this sacred\r\nedifice, but the exigencies of war required its use for this purpose,\r\nand of all the buildings occupied by us during our stay in Delhi, the\r\nchurch was found to be cleanest and best ventilated, free from the\r\nnoisome smells and close atmosphere of the native houses.\r\n\r\nThe close of the 18th saw our outposts extended hard by the Chandni\r\nChauk--the main street of the city--the bank, Major Abbott's and Khan\r\nMohammed's houses having first been seized by our men, who suffered\r\nseverely from the field-guns and musketry of the rebels. There was also\r\nanother unsuccessful attack made on the Burn bastion and Lahore Gate\r\nby the right column, in which the 75th lost one officer and many\r\nmen killed. The arrangements for attack seemed to have been bad and\r\nill-advised; the soldiers felt the want of the guiding genius of\r\nNicholson, and, during an advance through a narrow lane were literally\r\nmown down by grape from the enemy's field-guns.\r\n\r\nThe weather, which since the 14th had been fine, broke up on the night\r\nof the 18th, and was succeeded by a terrific storm of rain, which fell\r\nin torrents like a deluge. That night it was reported that the rebels in\r\ngreat numbers were evacuating the city by the south side, the Bareilly\r\nand Neemuch brigades making off in the direction of Gwalior. Certain it\r\nis that from this period signs of waning strength appeared among the\r\nenemy, and fewer attempts at assault were made on our outposts, those\r\non the left near the Palace, which were well protected by breastworks,\r\nbeing only exposed to a very desultory fire of musketry.\r\n\r\nDuring the forenoon of the 18th there was, I think, a partial eclipse of\r\nthe sun, which lasted three hours. The unusual darkness which prevailed\r\nastonished us beyond measure (our minds being taken up with events more\r\nstartling than astronomical phenomena) till reference to an almanac\r\nexplained the mystery. The eclipse had, we were told, an alarming effect\r\non the mutineers, who attributed the phenomenon to some supernatural\r\nagency. The darkness no doubt worked on their superstitious fears, and\r\nhastened their flight from the city on which the wrath of the Almighty\r\nhad descended.\r\n\r\n_September 19_.--On the 19th operations in front of the Palace Gate were\r\ncontinued, a heavy fire being kept up against that place, while the 60th\r\nRifles and others, perched on the tops of houses, took unerring aim at\r\nthe rebels clustered in the open space. The same evening, also, the\r\nexertions of the right column were rewarded by the capture of the Burn\r\nbastion, with little loss on our side.\r\n\r\nIt was now quite evident that the baffled insurgents were retiring from\r\nDelhi in great numbers, mostly by the south side, few crossing the\r\nbridge of boats by day owing to it being commanded by our guns. But on\r\nthe night of the 19th, when sitting in the church compound watching the\r\nshells exploding over the Palace and Selimgarh, we heard distinctly,\r\nthrough the intervals of firing, a distant, confused hum of voices, like\r\nthe murmur of a great multitude. The sound came from the direction of\r\nthe river, and was caused by multitudes of human beings, who, escaping\r\nby the bridge of boats to the opposite side, were deserting the city\r\nwhich was so soon to fall into our hands.\r\n\r\n_September 20_.--After some sharp fighting, and early on the morning of\r\nSeptember 20, the Lahore Gate and Garstin bastion, which during former\r\nassaults had cost us the lives of so many men, were taken, the column\r\npushing on along the walls to the Ajmir Gate, which also fell into our\r\nhands. There were few defenders at these places, the mass of sepoys\r\nhaving evidently fled into the country; and the troops marched through\r\nthe streets almost without opposition.\r\n\r\nThere now remained but the Palace, Selimgarh, and the Jama Masjid, and\r\nthese were all occupied by our troops on that day. The former seemed\r\nalmost deserted, an occasional shot from the high walls directed on our\r\ndefences in the Chandni Chauk being the only signs of animation in that\r\nquarter. Powder-bags were brought up and attached, to the great gate,\r\nwhich was quickly blown in; and the 60th Rifles, with some Goorkhas,\r\nrushed into the enclosure. A score or two of armed fanatics offered some\r\nresistance, but they were soon shot down or bayoneted, and a few wounded\r\nsepoys found in the buildings were put to death. Passing through the\r\nPalace, Selimgarh was entered, and this, the last fortified position\r\nbelonging to the enemy, was taken possession of without a struggle.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a force of cavalry under Hodson moved round outside the city\r\nwalls, and found a large camp of the enemy near the Delhi Gate. This\r\nwas deserted, save by some sick and wounded sepoys, who were put to the\r\nsword; and the horsemen, riding through the gate, made their way into\r\nthe heart of the city and took possession of the Jama Masjid without\r\nstriking a blow.\r\n\r\nDelhi had at length fallen into our hands, and the toils and dangers\r\nof more than three months were at an end. The principal buildings were\r\noccupied by our troops, and guards were placed at each gate with orders\r\nto prevent the ingress or egress of any suspicious-looking characters,\r\nwhile parties of armed men patrolled the streets of the city from end to\r\nend.\r\n\r\nThat night we moved back to our old quarters at Ahmed Ali Khan's house,\r\nthe 52nd taking our place at the church. The first-named building was a\r\nvast structure, belonging to a rich native, and had been furnished in a\r\nstyle of Oriental magnificence; but now nothing but the bare walls and\r\nfloors were to be seen, the place having been ransacked of its treasures\r\nand completely gutted since our last occupancy.\r\n\r\nFrom September 15 to 20, when Delhi fell, the force lost in killed and\r\nwounded about 200 officers and men, making the total casualties 1,400,\r\nincluding those of the day of assault.\r\n\r\nFrom May 30 to September 13 inclusive 2,490 officers and men were killed\r\nand wounded, the grand total being close on 4,000. Add to these fully\r\n1,200 who perished by cholera and other diseases, and it will be seen at\r\nwhat a fearful cost of life to the small force engaged the victory was\r\nwon.\r\n\r\nTruly the capture of Delhi was a feat of arms without a parallel in\r\nour Indian annals. The bravery of the men, their indomitable pluck and\r\nresolution, the siege carried on with dogged pertinacity and without a\r\nmurmur, proclaimed to the world that British soldiers, in those stormy\r\ntimes when the fate of an Empire was at issue, had fully maintained the\r\nreputation of their ancestors and earned the gratitude of their country.\r\n\r\nTo me, after the long interval of years, the incidents of the siege,\r\nwith its continual strife and ever-recurring dangers, come back to me as\r\nin a dream. Often in fancy has my mind wandered back to those days\r\nof turmoil and excitement, when men's hearts were agitated to their\r\nprofoundest depths, and our cause appeared wellnigh hopeless. Then it\r\nwas that a small body of men in a far-away part of North-West India,\r\nentirely separated from the rest of the world, a few thousands amongst\r\nmillions of an alien race, rallied round their country's banners and\r\ndespaired not, though mutiny and rebellion ranged through the land. With\r\nsteadfast purpose and with hearts that knew no fear, the Delhi army\r\nheld its own for months against an overwhelming force of cruel and\r\nremorseless rebels. Imperfectly equipped, and with little knowledge of\r\nthe dangers to be surmounted and the difficulties arising on every\r\nside, each man of that force felt himself a host, and devoted his\r\nenergies--nay, his very life--to meet the crisis. None but those who\r\nwere there can for one moment realize through what suffering and\r\nhardship the troops passed during the three months the Siege of Delhi\r\nlasted. Day after day, under a burning sun or through the deadly time of\r\nthe rainy season, with pestilence in their midst, distressing accounts\r\nfrom all parts of the country, and no hope of relief save through their\r\nown unaided exertions, the soldiers of the army before Delhi fought with\r\na courage and constancy which no difficulties could daunt and no trials,\r\nhowever severe, could overcome. In the end these men, worn out by\r\nexposure and diminished in numbers, stormed a strong fortified city\r\ndefended by a vastly superior force, and for six days carried on a\r\nconstant fight in the streets, till the enemy were driven out of their\r\nstronghold and Delhi was won. It must also be remembered that the\r\nfeat was accomplished without the help of a single soldier from home;\r\nreinforcements had arrived in the country, but they were hundreds of\r\nmiles distant when the news reached them of the capture of Delhi: and it\r\nis not too much to say that the success which followed the subsequent\r\noperations down-country was due mainly to the fact that all danger from\r\nthe north-west had virtually ceased, and the mutiny had already received\r\na crushing blow from the capture of the great city of rebellion.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Lieutenant Boileau, 61st Regiment, served in the batteries\r\ntill the end of the siege.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Are not the names of the Engineers Home and Salkeld and of\r\nBugler Hawthorne (H.M. 52nd Regiment) household words?]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Captain Deacon and Lieutenants Moore and Young were wounded\r\nin this engagement.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Colonel Deacon, Her Majesty's 61st Regiment, commanded on\r\nthis occasion.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nOCCUPATION OF THE CITY\r\n\r\nThe renown won by our troops in 1857 is now wellnigh forgotten, and,\r\nin fact, their deeds in that distant quarter of our Empire faded into\r\noblivion within a very short period subsequent to the capture of Delhi.\r\nWhen the regiments engaged at that place came home to England after a\r\nlong course of service in India, scarcely any notice was taken of their\r\narrival. There were no marchings past before Her Majesty at Windsor or\r\nelsewhere, no public distribution of medals and rewards, no banquets\r\ngiven to the leading officers of the force, and no record published\r\nof the arduous duties in which they had been engaged. Those times are\r\nchanged, and the country has now rushed into the opposite extreme of\r\nfulsome adulation, making a laughing-stock of the army and covering\r\nwith glory the conquerors in a ten days' war waged against the wretched\r\nfellaheen soldiers of Egypt.\r\n\r\nFive years passed away after 1857 (and how many poor fellows had died in\r\nthe meantime!) before a mean and niggardly Government distributed to the\r\nremnant of the Delhi army the first instalment of prize-money, and three\r\nyears more elapsed before the second was paid.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1861, exactly four years after the storm of Delhi, my\r\nregiment paraded at the Plymouth citadel to receive medals for the\r\ncampaign of 1857. The distribution took place in the quietest manner\r\npossible, none but the officers and men of the regiment being present.\r\nBorne on a large tray into the midst of a square, the medals were handed\r\nby a sergeant to each one entitled to the long-withheld decoration, the\r\nAdjutant meanwhile reading out the names of the recipients. There was\r\nno fuss or ceremony, but I recollect that those present could not help\r\ncontrasting the scene with the grand parade and the presence of the\r\nQueen when some of the Crimean officers and men received the numerous\r\ndecorations so lavishly bestowed for that campaign.[1]\r\n\r\nThe city was entirely in our possession by noon of September 20, and\r\nshortly after that hour I proceeded on horseback, with orders from\r\nthe Colonel, to withdraw all the advanced pickets of my regiment\r\nto headquarters at Ahmed Ali Khan's house. These were stationed in\r\ndifferent parts of the city, and it was with no small difficulty that I\r\nthreaded my way through the streets and interminable narrow lanes, which\r\nwere all blocked up with heaps of broken furniture and rubbish that had\r\nbeen thrown out of the houses by our troops, and formed in places an\r\nalmost impassable barrier. Not a soul was to be seen; all was still\r\nas death, save now and then the sound of a musket-shot in the far-off\r\nquarters of the town.\r\n\r\nMy duty accomplished, I started in the afternoon with two of our\r\nofficers to view a portion of the city. We made our way first in the\r\ndirection of the Palace, passing down the Chandni Chauk (Silver Street)\r\nand entering the Great Gate of the former imperial residence of the\r\nMogul Emperors. Here a guard of the 60th Rifles kept watch and ward with\r\nsome of the jovial little Goorkhas of the Kumaon battalion. From the\r\nfirst we learnt particulars of the easy capture of the Palace that\r\nmorning, and were shown the bodies of the fanatics who had disputed the\r\nentrance and had been killed in the enclosure. None of them were sepoys,\r\nbut belonged to that class of men called \"ghazi,\" or champions of the\r\nfaith, men generally intoxicated with bhang, who are to be found in\r\nevery Mohammedan army--fierce madmen, devotees to death in the cause of\r\nreligion. Passing on, we wandered through the courts, wondering at the\r\nvast size of this castellated palace with its towering, embattled walls,\r\ntill we came to the Dewan-i-Khas, and further on to the Dewan-i-Aum, or\r\nHall of Audience. This last, a large building of white marble on the\r\nbattlements overhanging the River Jumna, was now the headquarters of the\r\nGeneral and his staff, and where formerly the descendants of the great\r\nwarrior Tamerlane held their court, British officers had taken up their\r\nabode; and infidels desecrated those halls, where only \"true believers\"\r\nhad assembled for hundreds of years.\r\n\r\nPassing thence through a gateway and over a swinging bridge, we entered\r\nthe old fort of Selimgarh, built, like the Palace, on the banks of the\r\nriver, its battlements, as well as those of the latter place on its\r\neastern side, being washed by the waters of the Jumna. Several heavy\r\nguns and mortars were mounted on the walls of the fort, and we noticed\r\none old cannon of immense size for throwing stone balls, but which was\r\ncracked at the muzzle, and evidently had not been used for centuries.\r\nThe fort was full of large and commodious buildings, used afterwards for\r\nhospitals by our troops, the place itself, from its commanding situation\r\nopen and separate from the rest of the city, being the healthiest place\r\nthat could be found. There was a lovely view of the country on the left\r\nbank of the Jumna, while to the north and south we followed the windings\r\nof the broad river till lost to view in the far distance.\r\n\r\nDescending from Selimgarh, we took our stand on the bridge of boats now\r\ndeserted in its whole length, but over which, during the days of the\r\nsiege, thousands of mutineers had marched to swell the rebel forces in\r\nDelhi. Thence we skirted along the banks of the river outside the walls,\r\nviewing on our way the houses of the European residents, built in\r\ncharming situations close to the water's edge. These had been all\r\nentirely destroyed, gutted, and burnt; nothing but the bare walls were\r\nleft standing, and the interiors filled with heaps of ashes. We thought\r\nof the wretched fate of the former inmates of these houses, most of\r\nwhom had been mercilessly killed by the city rabble, urged on in their\r\nfiendish work by the native soldiers, of the regular army.\r\n\r\nThe mutineers of the 3rd Light Cavalry from Meerut had entered Delhi on\r\nMay 11, crossing the Jumna by the bridge of boats, and, being joined\r\nby the city scoundrels, first wreaked their vengeance on the European\r\nresidents who lived close by, and who, without any previous warning of\r\nthe terrible fate in store for them, fell easy victims to the murderers.\r\nIt made our blood run cold, when visiting the ruins of these houses, to\r\nthink of the dastardly crimes which had been committed in and around the\r\nspots on which we were standing. Defenceless and unarmed, helpless\r\nin the hands of these human tigers, our unfortunate men, women, and\r\nchildren were immolated without mercy. Turning back, we entered the city\r\nby the Calcutta Gate, and walked along the ramparts by the riverside,\r\npast the walls of the magazine, till we reached the Water bastion. Here\r\nthe destructive effect of our batteries during the bombardment was most\r\napparent. Fired at the distance of only 180 yards, the guns had smashed\r\nthe walls and ramparts to pieces, huge fragments had rolled down into\r\nthe ditch, and the cannon in the battery were completely dismounted from\r\nthe carriages, lying in confusion one on top of the other.\r\n\r\nAt the Kashmir Gate there was a heap of goods (consisting principally\r\nof clothes and rubbish) many feet high, which had been looted from the\r\nhouses around. The guard at the gate had orders to allow no one to pass\r\nout with a bundle of any kind; and the consequence was an accumulation\r\nof material, chiefly worthless, which covered many square yards of\r\nground. I have omitted all record of the plundering which up to this\r\ntime, and for long afterwards, took place all over the city where\r\nour troops had penetrated. This account I have reserved for the last\r\nchapter, where full details of the loot of Delhi and the amount of\r\nprize-money accruing to the force will be found. _September 21_.--During\r\nthe 21st I, in company with other officers, wandered over the heart of\r\nthe city, continuing our perambulations south of the Chandni Chauk and\r\npenetrating into streets beyond, where the six days' fighting had taken\r\nplace. The night before we had heard occasional shots fired at no great\r\ndistance, and these were continued during the day and for some time\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nLooting was going on to a great extent, both European and native\r\nsoldiers engaging in the work; and though strict orders had been issued\r\nto prevent such licence, it was found impossible to check the evil. The\r\nshots emanated from these men, who, of course, went about well armed,\r\nand brooked no interference when in the act of securing booty.\r\nAltercations of a serious nature had taken place between the Europeans\r\nand Sikh soldiers, ending sometimes in blows, and often in bloodshed,\r\nwhen the two parties met in a house or were busy employed in dividing\r\nthe spoil. However, in time, when most of the native troops had left\r\nDelhi, and the European regiments were quartered in walled enclosures\r\nwith a guard at the gates to prevent egress, the looting on the part of\r\nthe private soldiers ceased, and the prize agents were enabled to gather\r\nin the enormous wealth of the city without any trouble.\r\n\r\nThe portions of the town we passed through on that day had been pillaged\r\nto the fullest extent. Not content with ransacking the interior of each\r\nhouse, the soldiers had broken up every article of furniture, and with\r\nwanton destruction had thrown everything portable out of the windows.\r\nEach street was filled with a mass of debris consisting of household\r\neffects of every kind, all lying in inextricable confusion one on top of\r\nthe other, forming barricades--from end to end of a street--many feet\r\nhigh. We entered several of the large houses belonging to the wealthier\r\nclass of natives, and found every one in the same condition, turned\r\ninside out, their ornaments torn to pieces, costly articles, too heavy\r\nto remove, battered into fragments, and a general air of desolation\r\npervading each building. Much of this wholesale destruction was, no\r\ndoubt, attributable to the action of the sepoys and rabble of the city,\r\nwho during the siege, and in the state of anarchy which prevailed during\r\nthat period, had looted to their hearts' content, levying blackmail on\r\nthe richer inhabitants and pursuing their evil course without let or\r\nhindrance. Still, that which had escaped the plundering and devastating\r\nhands of the sepoys was most effectually ruined by our men. Not a\r\nsingle house or building remained intact, and the damage done must have\r\namounted to thousands of pounds.\r\n\r\nWe were quite alone in most streets; deserted and silent, they resembled\r\na city of the dead on which some awful catastrophe had fallen. It was\r\ndifficult to realize that we were passing through what had been, only a\r\nfew days before, the abode of thousands of people. What had become of\r\nthem, and by what magic influence had all disappeared? Not till days\r\nafterwards was the mystery solved.\r\n\r\nThe _tai-khanas_, or underground rooms of houses, scattered all over the\r\ncity, were found to be filled with human beings--those who, by age or\r\ninfirmity, had been unable to join in the general exodus which had taken\r\nplace during the last days of the siege. Hundreds of old men, women and\r\nchildren, were found huddled together, half starved, in these places,\r\nthe most wretched-looking objects I ever saw. There was no means of\r\nfeeding them in the city, where their presence also would have raised a\r\nplague and many would have died; so, by the orders of the General, they\r\nwere turned out of the gates of Delhi and escorted into the country. It\r\nwas a melancholy sight, seeing them trooping out of the town, hundreds\r\npassing through the Lahore Gate every day for a whole week. We were told\r\nthat provisions had been collected for their use at a place some miles\r\ndistant, and it is to be hoped the poor creatures were saved from\r\nstarvation; but we had our doubts on the subject, and, knowing how\r\ncallous with regard to human suffering the authorities had become, I\r\nfear that many perished from want and exposure.\r\n\r\nThere were other objects also which raised feelings of pity in our\r\nminds. During our walks through the streets we caught sight of dozens\r\nof cats and tame monkeys on the roofs of the houses, looking at us with\r\nmost woe-begone countenances, the latter chattering with fear. These, as\r\nwell as birds of every description left behind in cages by their owners\r\non their flight, literally starved to death in the houses and streets of\r\nthe city. There was no food for such as these, and it is lamentable to\r\nthink of the torture and suffering the poor pet creatures endured till\r\ndeath put an end to their misery.\r\n\r\nDead bodies of sepoys and city inhabitants lay scattered in every\r\ndirection, poisoning the air for many days, and raising a stench which\r\nwas unbearable. These in time were almost all cleared away by the native\r\nscavengers, but in some distant streets corpses lay rotting in the sun\r\nfor weeks, and during my rides on duty, when stationed at the Ajmir\r\nGate, I often came across a dead body which had escaped search.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 21st a most important capture was effected by\r\nHodson. Shah Bahadoor Shah, the old King of Delhi, was taken by that\r\nofficer near the city while endeavouring to escape down-country.\r\n\r\nHodson, with his accustomed daring, and accompanied by 100 only of his\r\nown troopers, seized the person of the King from amongst thousands of\r\narmed dependents and rabble, who, awed by his stern demeanour, did not\r\nraise a hand in resisting the capture. The King was brought to Delhi the\r\nsame day, and lodged as a prisoner in the house formerly the residence\r\nof the notorious Begum Sumroo. He was guarded by fifty men of my\r\nregiment, under command of a Lieutenant; and on the 22nd I went to see\r\nhim, accompanied by our Adjutant.\r\n\r\nSitting cross-legged on a cushion placed on a common native _charpoy_,\r\nor bed, in the verandah of a courtyard, was the last representative of\r\nthe Great Mogul dynasty. There was nothing imposing in his appearance,\r\nsave a long white beard which reached to his girdle. About middle\r\nheight, and upwards of seventy years old, he was dressed in white, with\r\na conical-shaped turban of the same colour and material, while at his\r\nback two attendants stood, waving over his head large fans of peacocks'\r\nfeathers, the emblem of sovereignty--a pitiable farce in the case of one\r\nwho was already shorn of his regal attributes, a prisoner in the hands\r\nof his enemies. Not a word came from his lips; in silence he sat day and\r\nnight, with his eyes cast on the ground, and as though utterly oblivious\r\nof the condition in which he was placed. On another bed, three feet\r\nfrom the King, sat the officer on guard, while two stalwart European\r\nsentries, with fixed bayonets, stood on either side. The orders given\r\nwere that on any attempt at a rescue the officer was immediately to\r\nshoot the King with his own hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KING OF DELHI AS A PRISONER IN 1857.]\r\n\r\n[From a photograph taken from a pencil sketch by Captain Robles, who was\r\nplaced on guard over him.]\r\n\r\nThe old King was brought to trial shortly afterwards at the palace, and\r\nfound guilty of complicity in the murders of our country men and women,\r\nand was transported beyond the seas, dying in British Burmah before he\r\ncould be removed to the Andaman Islands, where, in accordance with his\r\nsentence, he was to have remained in imprisonment for the term of\r\nhis natural life. The vicissitudes of fortune, numberless as are the\r\ninstances among men of royal birth, can scarcely show anything more\r\nsuggestive of the transitoriness of earthly pomp and grandeur than\r\nthe case of the last King of Delhi. Sprung from the line of the great\r\nconqueror Tamerlane, the lineal descendant of the magnanimous Akbar and\r\nof Shah Jehan the magnificent, he ended his days as a common felon, far\r\nfrom the country of his ancestors, unwept for and unhonoured.\r\n\r\n_September 22_.--Lieutenant Hodson, also on the 22nd, took prisoner, at\r\na place some miles from Delhi, the two eldest sons and the grandson\r\nof the King. These men, more especially the eldest, who was\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the rebel army, had been deeply implicated in the\r\nmurders of May 11, had urged on the sepoys and populace in their cruel\r\ndeeds, and were present at the terrible massacre of our people which\r\ntook place in the Chandni Chauk on that day.\r\n\r\nHodson's orders were precise as to the fate of these blood-thirsty\r\nruffians, and though his name has been vilified and his reputation\r\ntarnished by so-called humanitarians for the course he adopted in\r\nridding the world of the miscreants, he was upheld in the deed by the\r\nwhole Delhi army, men in every respect better qualified to form a\r\njudgment in this particular than the sentimental beings at home who\r\ndenounced with horror this perfectly justifiable act of speedy and\r\ncondign punishment.\r\n\r\nThe three Princes were placed in a _gharee_, or native carriage, and,\r\nguarded by Hodson's native troopers, were conducted towards the city.\r\nBefore they entered, the carriage was stopped, and Hodson spoke to his\r\nmen of the crimes committed by the prisoners. Then, dismounting from his\r\nhorse and opening the door of the _gharee_, he fired two shots from a\r\nColt's revolver into each of their hearts. After being driven to the\r\nKotwali, or chief magistrate's house, in the centre of the Chandni\r\nChauk, on the very spot where our country men and women had suffered\r\ndeath, the three bodies were stripped save a rag around the loins, and\r\nlaid naked on the stone slabs outside the building.\r\n\r\nHere I saw them that same afternoon; nor can it be said that I or the\r\nothers who viewed the lifeless remains felt any pity in our hearts for\r\nthe wretches on whom had fallen a most righteous retribution for their\r\ncrimes. The eldest was a strong, well-knit man in the prime of life, the\r\nnext somewhat younger, while the third was quite a youth not more than\r\ntwenty years of age. Each of the Princes had two small bullet-holes over\r\nthe region of the heart, the flesh singed by gunpowder, as the shots\r\nwere fired close; a cloth covered part of the loins, but they were\r\notherwise quite naked. There was a guard, I think, of Coke's Rifles\r\nstationed at the Kotwali, and there the bodies remained exposed for\r\nthree days, and were then buried in dishonoured graves.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd the regiment, or what was left of it, comprising about 180\r\neffective rank and file, moved from Ahmed Ali Khan's house to the Ajmir\r\nGate at the extreme south-western side of the city, a distance of a mile\r\nand a half from our former residence. Here we put up in a large serai,\r\nwith open courtyards in the centre, shaded by high trees, the small\r\nrooms on each side of the building being turned into quarters for the\r\nmen, the officers taking up their abode in a mosque at the far end. The\r\nchange was far from agreeable; flies and mosquitoes swarmed around us,\r\nthe ditch outside the walls was filled with pools of stagnant water, and\r\na horrible stench impregnated the air, increasing the sickness among\r\nthe already enfeebled soldiers, and still further reducing our scanty\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\n_September 23_.--The next day I started with D----, of my regiment, to\r\nview the Jama Masjid, or Great Mosque. Nothing can exceed the rich,\r\nthough chaste, beauty of this glorious structure. The building stands\r\nin a large walled enclosure, high broad steps leading up to the mosque,\r\nwith its three domes of pure white marble and floor of the same\r\nmaterial, all inlaid with figures. We ascended one of the minarets,\r\nabout 120 feet high, obtaining a grand view of the imperial city and the\r\nsurrounding country. To the south extended the ruins of Ferozebad, or\r\nancient Delhi; to the east lay the River Jumna; and to the west and\r\nnorth stretched a forest of trees and gardens, among which were seen the\r\nsuburbs of the city, the now historic ridge in the far distance hiding\r\nthe whole camp from our view. From our elevated position a just estimate\r\ncould be formed of the great size of Delhi: the city lay spread out\r\nbelow with its vast area of streets, its palaces, mosques, and temples,\r\nall silent and deserted, in striking contrast to the din and turmoil of\r\na few days back.\r\n\r\nMajor Coke's corps of Punjab Rifles were quartered in the Masjid--a\r\nluxurious place of residence--but there were no worshippers to be found\r\nin the sacred building, and only armed men of an infidel creed were to\r\nbe seen. A report spread at this time that it had been decided to blow\r\nup the mosque. I cannot vouch for the truth of this statement, and can\r\nonly attribute the rumour to a belief that a large ransom would be paid\r\nby the Mohammedan population of India for the preservation of their\r\ntemple had the authorities really intended to carry out the project. Its\r\ndestruction would have been an act of vandalism quite at variance with\r\nthe character of the British nation, and one which would have brought\r\ndown on us the wrath and contempt of the whole civilized world.\r\n\r\nFrom the Jama Masjid we wandered through narrow lanes and\r\nback-slums--the former resort of the worst characters in the city--to\r\nthe Delhi and Turkoman Gates, the streets, as in other parts, being\r\nstrewed with property from the wrecked houses, and wellnigh impassable.\r\nWe saw parties of Europeans and native soldiers, all eager in the\r\npursuit of plunder, going from house to house, or diving down courts and\r\nalleys when they saw us approaching. Interference or remonstrance with\r\nthese men would have been useless, if not dangerous; in their excited\r\nstate they were no respecters of persons, and we deemed it the better\r\njudgment to take no notice of their actions. Dead bodies lay in almost\r\nevery street, rotting in the burning sun, and the effluvium was\r\nsickening, so that we were glad to make our way back to the Ajmir Gate\r\nto a less poisonous atmosphere.\r\n\r\nA movable column of 2,500 men of all arms started on the morning of the\r\n23rd in pursuit of the rebels, taking the direction to Cawnpore. My\r\nregiment had been detailed for this service; and, though numerically\r\nweak, and suffering from sickness, the officers and men hailed with\r\npleasure the approaching departure from Delhi. But, unfortunately for\r\nus, the Colonel in command reported us sick and unfit to march. We were\r\nall to a man furious at this; everyone fit for duty was willing, heart\r\nand soul, to be sent wherever the exigencies of the war required, and\r\nmore especially looked forward with delight to the prospect of serving\r\nunder Sir Colin Campbell, in whose brigade the regiment had fought in\r\nthe Punjab campaign of 1848-49. Still, the decision of the responsible\r\nofficer was not to be disputed, and so the regiment was kept at Delhi.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th I mounted guard with fifty men at the Lahore Gate. The\r\norders were \"on no account to allow soldiers, either European or native,\r\nnor camp-followers without passes, to enter or leave the city.\" My post\r\nwas constantly at the gate, where I examined passes; and while\r\nthus occupied some thirty troopers of the Mooltani Horse--wild,\r\ntruculent-looking fellows, armed to the teeth--rode up demanding\r\nentrance. I explained to them what my orders were, and refused\r\nadmission. Whereupon they commenced talking among themselves, and\r\npresently had the audacity to move towards the sentries with the\r\nintention of forcing their way. I was exasperated beyond measure, and\r\nturned out the guard, at the same time telling the Mooltanis that, if\r\nthey did not at once retire, I would fire upon them without more\r\nado. They then at once changed their threatening attitude, contented\r\nthemselves with swearing at the _Gore log_,[2] and rode away, saying\r\nthat now Nicholson was dead no one cared for them, and they would return\r\nto their homes. These men had been newly raised, were scarcely under\r\nproper discipline, and were certainly horrible-looking bandits and\r\ncut-throats--very different from the Sikh and Punjabi Horsemen, who were\r\nin manner and discipline all that could be desired. I knew that the\r\nMooltanis only desired entrance into the city to participate in the\r\nlooting which was still going on; and had they been allowed to indulge\r\nin a work for which by their evil countenances they seemed well adapted,\r\ncollisions would have taken place between them and the English soldiers\r\nand others, and bloodshed would have been the result.\r\n\r\nShortly after the Mooltani Horsemen rode away I saw a party of Goorkhas\r\ncoming towards the gate. They were strolling along quite unconcernedly,\r\nlaughing and chatting together, with their hands in their pockets and\r\nquite unarmed, not even carrying their favourite _kukri_. Coming to\r\nwhere I was standing just outside the gate, they laughingly asked me to\r\nallow them to take a stroll down the Chandni Chauk and through a part of\r\nthe city for a short time. My orders were imperative, and I told them\r\nso; whereat they said they belonged to the Sirmoor battalion--the\r\ngallant regiment which, in conjunction with the 60th Rifles, had\r\ndefended the right of our position throughout the siege. The corps was\r\nstill stationed at their old quarters at Hindoo Rao's house, and not one\r\nof them up to this time had entered Delhi. Naturally, they said they\r\nwished to see the city, promised most faithfully that they would refrain\r\nfrom looting, and return to the Lahore Gate in an hour's time. I found I\r\ncould not resist the importunities of these brave little fellows, and,\r\ntrusting to their honour, at last consented, though contrary to orders,\r\nto grant them admission. We watched them walking along the Chandni\r\nChauk, staring in wonder at all they saw, till lost in the distance.\r\nPunctual to the time mentioned the Goorkhas returned, and, thanking me\r\nfor my courtesy, made their way to their old quarters on the ridge.\r\n\r\nDuring my tour on duty on this occasion at the Lahore Gate upwards of\r\n500 of the Delhi populace were turned out of the city. They extended\r\nin a long string up the Chandni Chauk, decrepit old men and women\r\nwith groups of young children. It was a pitiable sight, drawing forth\r\nexclamations of sympathy even from the rough soldiers on guard.\r\n\r\nIt had been brought to the notice of the General that some of the former\r\ninhabitants of Delhi, including sepoys, were in the habit of entering\r\nthe city for the purpose of carrying away valuables, being drawn up by\r\nropes held by confederates on the walls, and that many had also escaped\r\nin the darkness by the same means. Several captures had already been\r\nmade, a strict watch was ordered to be kept at the several gates, and\r\npatrolling parties to march at intervals outside the walls. The day I\r\nwas on guard at the Lahore Gate Hodson rode up to me from the outside,\r\nand said he had seen some natives on the walls close by, evidently\r\nattempting to escape into the country. I immediately sent round a\r\ncorporal and four soldiers in the direction indicated, who presently\r\nreturned with six natives--carrying bundles--whom they had made\r\nprisoners. All men thus captured were sent to the Governor of the city\r\nat the Kotwalli, who disposed of them as he thought fit, having the\r\npower of life and death in these matters. The Governor had the repute of\r\nbeing over-indulgent with regard to the disposal of the captives, being\r\nconsidered too merciful in his treatment of men who, for aught he knew,\r\nhad forfeited their lives in joining the armed rebellion against our\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nA striking instance of the feeling which animated officers and men in\r\nthe troublous times took place some time afterwards at Delhi. An officer\r\nof my regiment was on guard at the Ajmir Gate, and on one occasion sent\r\nto the Governor some men whom he had captured while they were in the\r\nact of escaping from the city. These men were released; but on a second\r\noccasion three men were taken, and the officer, deeming it useless to\r\nforward them for punishment to the usual authority, called out a file of\r\nhis soldiers, placed the prisoners in the ditch outside the Ajmir\r\nGate, shot them, and then, digging a hole, buried them at the place of\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nFor a long period after the capture of Delhi executions by hanging\r\nwere of common occurrence in the city, and the hands of the old\r\nprovost-sergeant were full. Disguised sepoys and inhabitants taken\r\nwith arms in their possession had short shrift, and were at once\r\nconsigned to the gallows, a batch of ten one day suffering death\r\nopposite the Kotwali.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of October two more reputed sons of the old King were\r\nshot by sentence of court-martial. They had commanded regiments of\r\nthe rebel army, and were foremost in the revolt, even joining in the\r\nmassacre of our people. The 60th Rifles and some Goorkhas formed\r\nthe firing party, and took, strange to say, such bad aim that the\r\nprovost-sergeant had to finish the work by shooting each culprit with\r\na pistol. Nothing could have been more ill-favoured and dirty than the\r\nwretched victims; but they met their fate in silence and with the most\r\ndogged composure.\r\n\r\n_September 28_.--Accompanied by our Adjutant and some other officers, I\r\nrode out to Taliwarra and Kishenganj on September 28. These suburbs were\r\na mass of ruins, but enough was left intact to show the immense strength\r\nof the enemy's position at the former place. Batteries had been erected\r\nat every available spot, strongly fortified and entrenched, and one in\r\nparticular which had raked the right of our position was perfect in\r\nevery detail, and was guarded by a ditch, or rather _nallah_, forty feet\r\ndeep.\r\n\r\nWe passed through the large caravanserai, the scene of the conflict\r\nduring the memorable sortie of July 9, and when in the course of our\r\ninspection in the enclosure a ludicrous event occurred. An officer who\r\nhad been shot through the leg on that day, recognizing the place where\r\nhe had received his wound, dismounted from his horse, and stood on the\r\nvery spot. He was in the act of explaining events, and describing his\r\nsensations when shot, when suddenly he made a jump in the air, uttering\r\na cry of pain, and commenced rubbing his legs, first one and then the\r\nother. We burst into laughter at the antics of our friend, who, we\r\nimagined, had been seized with a fit of madness quite at variance with\r\nhis usual quiet demeanour, and jokingly asked him what was the matter.\r\nStill writhing with pain, and engaged in his involuntary saltatory\r\nexercise, he pointed to a swarm of wasps which, roused from their nest,\r\non which he had been standing, covered his lower extremities, and had\r\nmade their way inside his pantaloons, stinging him on both legs, and\r\ncrawling up his body. The pain must have been intense, and fully\r\naccounted for his gymnastics and frantic efforts to crush the insects.\r\nIt was some days before he recovered from the wounds he had received,\r\nfar more painful--as he averred--than the enemy's bullet, I intimated\r\nat the time to my friend that the wasps probably were the ghosts of\r\nthe sepoys who had been killed in the serai, their bodies, by the\r\ntransmigration of souls, having taken the shape of these malignant\r\ninsects in order to wreak vengeance on their destroyers. He, however,\r\ndid not seem to relish my interpretation of this very singular event,\r\nand, in fact, was inclined to resent what he called my ill-timed\r\njesting; but the story spread, and our poor friend became for some time\r\nafterwards the butt and laughing-stock of the regiment.\r\n\r\nFrom Kishenganj we rode through the Sabzi Mandi Gardens, visiting our\r\nold pickets there and at the Crow's Nest, and then proceeded up the\r\nslope of the ridge to Hindoo Rao's house. This was still garrisoned by\r\nthe Sirmoor battalion of Goorkhas, some of whom escorted us round the\r\nplace, pointing out the different positions they had so gallantly\r\ndefended. The house was knocked to pieces, the walls showing evidence of\r\nthe enemy's fire, and revealing to us the truth of the saying in camp\r\nthat these hardy little fellows, with the 60th Rifles, during more than\r\nthree months, had been constantly exposed night and day to shot and\r\nshell, there not being a single part of their quarters where complete\r\nshelter could be found.\r\n\r\nThe Observatory, close to Hindoo Rao's house, had also felt the effect\r\nof the enemy's shot, while midway between the Observatory and the\r\nFlagstaff Tower, the Mosque--the only other building on the ridge--was\r\nalso in ruins. Our batteries, nine in number, lay in a comparatively\r\nsmall compass, extending about three-quarters of a mile from the Crow's\r\nNest in the right rear to Wilson's battery opposite the Observatory. The\r\nrest of the ridge was unprotected by guns in position, it being at so\r\ngreat a distance from the city and also free from the enemy's attacks;\r\nthe only danger and annoyance arose from occasional shells, which\r\nreached the camp and exploded amongst the tents, from round-shot and\r\nfrom rocket fire.\r\n\r\nPassing by the Flagstaff Tower, we rode through the old camp, now\r\ndesolate and silent, visiting the graves of our poor fellows at the\r\ncemetery, and then, retracing our steps, entered Delhi by the Kashmir\r\nGate, and returned to our quarters.\r\n\r\nCholera still continued its ravages among the small number of troops\r\nleft in Delhi. The reaction from a life of strife and excitement to the\r\ndull existence we were now leading had its effects on the men, and we\r\neach day lamented more and more that we had not gone with the Movable\r\nColumn, leaving the noisome smells, the increasing sickness, and the\r\nmonotony of Delhi behind. Two thousand sick and wounded had been moved\r\ninto the Fort of Selimgarh, where the pure air and open situation of the\r\nplace soon made a marked change in the number of invalids: but disease\r\nwas rife among the regiments quartered in the city, and convalescents\r\nfrom Selimgarh were soon replaced by men suffering from cholera and\r\nfever ague.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of October, to our intense delight, we moved from the\r\nAjmir Gate, that sink of corruption, and took up our quarters in the\r\nmagazine. The officers here occupied a fine roomy building of two\r\nstories, while the men were housed in comfortable sheds round the\r\nenclosure. We still furnished guards at the Ajmir and Lahore Gates, the\r\nterm of duty, through paucity of men for relief, extending over three\r\ndays. The officer on guard at the former gate visited detachments and\r\nsentries at the \"Delhi\" and \"Turkoman\" Gates, a distance of a mile and\r\na half through streets in which dead bodies in the last stage of\r\ndecomposition were still lying. While one day engaged on this duty, I\r\npassed a carcass on which some pariah dogs were making a meal. Disgusted\r\nat the sight, and weak in stomach from the putrid air, I returned to\r\nmy tent at the Ajmir Gate at the time when my servant arrived with my\r\ndinner from the magazine. I asked him what he had brought me, and was\r\nanswered, \"Liver and bacon.\" The nauseating sight I had just witnessed\r\nrecurred to my memory, visions of diseased and putrid livers rose before\r\nmy view, and, unable to control myself, I was seized with a fit of\r\nsickness which prostrated me for some time after.\r\n\r\nNothing of importance occurred during the month of October. We settled\r\ninto a very quiet life at the magazine, varied by eternal guard-mounting\r\nat the different gates of the city and regimental drill. My health had\r\nbeen failing for some time, and, now that there seemed no immediate\r\nprospect of employment on active service, I gladly acquiesced in the\r\ndoctor's advice that I should proceed to Umballah on sick leave.\r\n\r\n_November 8_.--Accordingly I left Delhi on November 8, my destination\r\nbeing Umballah, a station in the Cis-Sutlej provinces. A _palki ghari_,\r\nor Indian carriage, drawn by two horses, awaited me that evening at\r\nSelimgarh, and, bidding adieu to our good doctor, who had nursed me with\r\nunremitting attention during my sickness, I entered the carriage.\r\nJust before starting, an officer of my regiment handed me two\r\ndouble-barrelled pistols--revolvers were at a premium in those\r\ndays--saying they might possibly come in useful during my journey, and\r\nI little thought at the time that their services would be brought into\r\nrequisition.\r\n\r\nThe country around Delhi swarmed with _goojars_, the generic name for\r\nprofessional thieves, who inhabited the numerous villages and levied\r\nblackmail on travellers, though seldom interfering with Europeans. My\r\nbaggage, consisting of two _petarahs_ (native leather trunks) containing\r\nuniform and clothing, was deposited on the roof of the vehicle under\r\ncharge of my bearer, but the loot I had acquired, I had safely stowed in\r\na despatch-box, which was placed under my pillow in the interior of the\r\ncarriage. A bed, comfortably arranged, occupied the seats, and on this I\r\nlay down, closing the doors of the _ghari_ when night came on.\r\n\r\nSome two stages from Delhi, after changing horses and proceeding on the\r\njourney along the pucka road, I fell into a doze, and at last into a\r\nsound sleep. From this I was rudely awakened by shouts of \"Chor! chor!\"\r\n(Thief! thief!) from my bearer and the native coachman. Starting up,\r\nI seized the pistols, and opening the doors of the _ghari_, saw, as I\r\nfancied, some forms disappearing in the darkness at the side of the\r\nroad. I fired two barrels in the direction and pursued for some\r\ndistance, but finding that my shots had not taken effect, and fearful of\r\nlosing my way--for the night was pitch-dark--I returned to the carriage.\r\nMy bearer then told me that some robbers had climbed up the back of the\r\n_ghari_, taken the two _petarahs_ between which he was lying, and made\r\noff into the country. We had been driving at the usual pace, about six\r\nmiles an hour, and it proves the practised skill and agility of the\r\n_goojars_, who, with such ease, had abstracted the boxes from under the\r\nvery nose of my servant. There was nothing for it but to continue my\r\njourney regretting the loss of my personal effects, but still fortunate\r\nin one respect--that the loot was safe under my pillow.\r\n\r\n_November 9_.--At the next stage I questioned the horse-keeper,\r\nacquainting him with the robbery, and learned that a village inhabited\r\nby _goojars_ lay off the road not far from the place where the robbery\r\nhad been perpetrated. In the morning I arrived at the civil station\r\nof Karnal, and drove to the residence of the Commissioner, to whom I\r\nreported my loss, giving the name of the village where it had occurred.\r\nHe told me to make out a valuation of the things stolen and to send it\r\nto him on the first opportunity. This I did on reaching Umballah, fixing\r\nthe value of the different articles in the boxes at 250 rupees. A month\r\nafterwards, when the affair had almost faded from my memory, I received\r\na letter from the Commissioner stating that he had visited the village\r\nnear the spot where the robbery had taken place. The headman had been\r\nsummoned to his presence, and warned that, unless the thieves were\r\ngiven up and the boxes returned with their contents intact, he would\r\nconfiscate a certain number of cattle, and sell the same to indemnify\r\nme for the losses I had sustained. These orders being unfulfilled, the\r\ncattle were sold, and an order for 250 rupees was enclosed to me in the\r\nletter. The boxes, quite empty, with the exception of my journals, were\r\nfound afterwards at the bottom of a well and were forwarded to Umballah.\r\nThe ink had run in the journals from immersion in the water, but the\r\nwriting was little defaced, and these papers--to me the most precious\r\npart of my luggage--I was glad to recover.\r\n\r\nThe change to Umballah was at first beneficial, but later on I suffered\r\na relapse; and after appearing before a medical board, was granted a\r\nyear's leave to England.\r\n\r\nFrom Umballah I journeyed to Ferozepore, where I met several of my\r\nbrother-officers and others who, like myself, had been invalided home.\r\n\r\n_January 10, 1858_.--After a short stay there--the time being\r\nprincipally taken up with chartering boats and providing necessaries\r\nfor the passage down the river--we all, to the number of about fifty\r\npersons, occupying twenty-two boats, which had to be specially fitted up\r\nwith straw-built houses with sloping roofs, set off on January 10, 1858,\r\nunder the protection of a guard of Sikhs, and, after what may on the\r\nwhole be regarded as a pleasant trip, reached Tattah on February 11.\r\nThence I went on to Karachi and Bombay and Marseilles, and, after a\r\npleasant tour on the Continent of Europe, arrived in the Old Country in\r\nMay, 1858, after an absence of rather more than six years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"HOMEWARD,\" NEAR JERRICK, ON THE INDUS]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Since the above was written, especial honour has been shown\r\nto those who participated in the hardships and glories of the campaign\r\nby His Majesty King Edward VII., who received the surviving officers at\r\na levee at St. James's Palace on June 3, 1907.\r\n\r\nA public dinner was also given by the proprietors of the _Daily\r\nTelegraph_ in the Albert Hall on December 23 of the same year to all the\r\nsurviving veterans who had taken part in the suppression of the Mutiny\r\nin 1857.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: White people.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE RICHES OF DELHI\r\n\r\nThe riches of the city of Delhi and the opulence of its Princes and\r\nmerchants had been celebrated in Hindostan from time immemorial. For\r\nages it had been the capital of an empire extending from the snows of\r\nthe Himalayas to Cape Comorin; and to Delhi, as to a centre, gravitated\r\nthe wealth of the richest country in the world. Fabulous reports had\r\nreached us of the booty carried away to distant regions by the numerous\r\nwarriors who burst like a torrent over Hindostan, making that city the\r\ngoal of their conquests and the scene of their predatory forays. During\r\nthe nineteenth century Delhi, since its capture by Lord Lake in 1803,\r\nhad remained in the hands of the British, the city owing a nominal\r\nallegiance to the King, who, to all intents and purposes a State\r\nprisoner, was a pensioner of our Government up to 1857, holding a Court\r\n(consisting for the most part of wretched dependents and ragamuffins) in\r\nthe Palace of the Great Mogul.\r\n\r\nThe quiet which reigned during that period had a salutary effect on the\r\nprosperity of Delhi; its merchants and storekeepers, trading with\r\nthe inhabitants of the richly-cultivated Dooab and with more distant\r\ncountries, became rich and prosperous, accumulating vast treasures,\r\nwhile the people, with the instinct of a penurious race, converted their\r\nready-money into jewels and gold and silver ornaments, and safely stowed\r\nthem away in hidden receptacles within their houses.\r\n\r\nThe numerous races of India--and notably the Sikhs--burning for an\r\nopportunity to plunder the imperial city, cast longing eyes towards\r\nthese hidden treasures, the fame of which had spread far and wide; and\r\nto this desire may be attributed, as much as any other reason, the\r\nwillingness of that warlike people to help us during the Mutiny.\r\n\r\nWhile the siege was progressing, even at a time when clouded with\r\nanxiety as to the future, men's minds were full of the uncertain issue\r\nof the fight; the thoughts of all in camp turned involuntarily to the\r\nrich harvest awaiting the army should Delhi fall into our hands. To all\r\nof us (putting aside the morality of the question), the loot of the\r\ncity was to be a fitting recompense for the toils and privations we had\r\nundergone; nor did the questionable character of the transaction weigh\r\nfor one moment with us against the recognized military law--\"that a city\r\ntaken by assault belonged as prize to the conquerors.\" During the actual\r\nbombardment, when the end seemed at hand, this subject of prize was the\r\ntopic of conversation among both officers and men; and soon we learnt\r\nwith satisfaction that the General in command, after consulting with\r\nothers in authority, had settled on the course to be pursued.\r\n\r\nOn September 7 a notice appeared in \"orders\" in which General Wilson\r\nthanked the army for the courage and devotion displayed during the long\r\nmonths of the siege. He recapitulated the dangers through which the\r\nforce had passed, and looked forward hopefully to the future when,\r\nProvidence favouring us, a few short days would see the enemy's\r\nstronghold pass into our hands. Instructions the most peremptory were\r\nlaid down as to the absolute necessity for the troops keeping well\r\ntogether on the day of assault, and not dispersing in scattered bands\r\nor alone through the streets of the city in pursuit of plunder. Great\r\ndanger and possible annihilation of the small army would result were\r\nthese precautions overlooked, rendering the force liable to be cut up\r\nin detail by the large bodies of rebels then occupying the streets and\r\nhouses of Delhi. Lastly, as a reward and incentive to all engaged, the\r\nGeneral gave his word, promising that all property captured in the city\r\nwould be placed in one common fund, to be distributed as prize according\r\nto the rules of war in such cases. The commanding officer, as well as\r\nall in the army, knew that it would be impossible to prevent looting\r\naltogether, but it was hoped that the above order would have a good\r\neffect by urging on the soldiers, for their welfare and advantage, the\r\nnecessity of obeying the instructions therein laid down.\r\n\r\nThis order, as I have said, appeared on September 7; nor, from the\r\npromises given, had any of us the slightest doubt but that its\r\nprovisions with regard to prize-money would be carried into effect in\r\ndue course. Delhi was taken, but as time passed by, and months elapsed\r\nwithout any notification on the subject being received from the Supreme\r\nGovernment, the army began to feel anxious, and murmurs arose as to the\r\nnon-fulfilment of the pledge given by General Wilson. At length, at the\r\nend of the year, the Governor-General, with the advice of his Executive\r\nCouncil, promulgated his decision that there was an objection to the\r\ntroops receiving the Delhi prize-money, and in lieu thereof granted as a\r\nrecompense for their arduous labours and patient endurance in the field\r\nthe \"magnificent\" sum of six months' batta.\r\n\r\nLord Canning, his Council and law advisers, all civilians sitting\r\nquietly at Calcutta, living in ease and comfort far from the dangers of\r\nwar, thought, forsooth, that the Delhi army, struggling for existence\r\nfor months, fighting to uphold British rule in India--nay, for the very\r\nlives and safety of these civilian judges--and at last victorious in the\r\ncontest, would rest content with their decision.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that this roused a storm of indignation not only\r\namongst the Delhi force, but throughout the British army in India--a\r\nburst of resentment which, reaching the Governor-General, made him pause\r\nand reconsider his ill-timed and unjust decision. Suffice it to say that\r\nthe order was rescinded, and that the prize-money, in addition to six\r\nmonths' batta, was granted to all engaged.\r\n\r\nThe day that the news of the first decision of the Government arrived at\r\nDelhi, when all at that place were full of the wrong done to the army, a\r\nprivate soldier of the 60th Rifles, inspired by the most exquisite sense\r\nof humour as well as of bitter satire, wrote upon the walls of the\r\npalace where his regiment was quartered the following appropriate\r\nsentence: \"Delhi taken and India saved for 36 rupees 10 annas.\" It\r\nis said that the Governor-General demanded the name of this waggish\r\nsoldier, with the intention that he might receive punishment for his\r\ndaring effrontery; but it is needless to say that the author of the joke\r\nremained unknown save to a few of his comrades; and the great ruler of\r\nHindostan was forced to rest content and ponder over the hidden sarcasm\r\nand bitter irony addressed to one in his exalted position.\r\n\r\nThe army was further promised by the Government 5 per cent, on the whole\r\namount of the prize-money till the amount should be paid. This, during\r\nthe many years which elapsed before the money was distributed,\r\nwould have reached a large sum; but faith was broken and the sum\r\nrepudiated--another instance of want of gratitude to soldiers who,\r\nlooked to maintain their country's honour in time of war, are in peace,\r\nand when danger is at an end, soon forgotten. So prolonged, also, was\r\nthe delay in payment of the prize-money that, I recollect, the Times, in\r\nreference to this subject about 1860 or 1861, had a leading article in\r\nits columns recommending the Delhi army to bring an action against the\r\nGovernment for the payment of the prize. Such action, of course, would\r\nhave been without precedent, but it showed the feeling of many in the\r\ncountry when the leading journal thought right to draw attention to the\r\nsubject with a view to the adjustment of the army's rightful claim.\r\n\r\nTo return to General Wilson's order of September 7. Notices were\r\ncirculated throughout the camp in every brigade and regiment, calling on\r\nthe troops to elect prize agents for gathering and receiving prize after\r\nthe capture of the city. These prize agents, therefore, were selected\r\nby the army, one for the general and field officers, the second for the\r\nQueen's service of all ranks below that of Major, and the third for the\r\ncompany's army. The officers appointed, including Captain Fagan, and\r\nafter his death Doctor Innes, Sir Edward Campbell, of the 60th Rifles,\r\nand Captain Wriford, of the 1st Bengal Fusiliers, were all most popular\r\nmen, and considered in every way fit for the very important duties they\r\nhad to perform.\r\n\r\nOn September 14, the day of assault, till the 20th, when Delhi was\r\ncompletely in our possession, much looting took place in the city. Our\r\ntroops, both European and native, and especially the Sikhs, entered\r\nhouses during those days and managed to secrete about their persons\r\narticles of value. To my certain knowledge, also, many soldiers of the\r\nEnglish regiments got possession of jewellery and gold ornaments taken\r\nfrom the bodies of the slain sepoys and city inhabitants, and I was\r\nshown by men of my regiment strings of pearls and gold mohurs which had\r\nfallen into their hands.\r\n\r\nOn the day of assault we were much amused, during a slight cessation of\r\nthe conflict, by one of our men rushing up to a group of officers in a\r\nstate of great excitement, with the news that there was a buggy with two\r\nhorses standing at the corner of a street close by. He offered the prize\r\nto anyone who would give him a bottle of rum; but in the then state of\r\naffairs no one felt inclined to burden himself with such a luxury, and\r\nthe poor fellow went away much disappointed. Whether he succeeded in\r\ndisposing of the prize I don't know; but when things quieted down, and\r\nthe regiment was stationed in comfortable quarters, one of our officers,\r\nnoted for his constant impecuniosity, appeared one day driving a buggy\r\nand two horses, the acquisition of which always remained a secret; nor\r\nwould he, on being questioned, throw any light on the matter.\r\n\r\nThat many of the private soldiers of my regiment succeeded in acquiring\r\na great quantity of valuable plunder was fully demonstrated soon after\r\nour arrival in England. An unusual number of non-commissioned officers\r\nand men bought their discharge, having during three years kept\r\npossession of the plunder acquired at Delhi awaiting a favourable\r\nopportunity for the sale of the articles. Many jewellers' shops in\r\nthe town in which we were quartered exposed for sale in the windows\r\nornaments and trinkets of unmistakable Eastern workmanship, which, on\r\ninquiry, we were told had been bought from the men.\r\n\r\nIt would have been contrary to human nature, and utterly at variance\r\nwith the predatory instinct, had the soldiers failed to take advantage\r\nof the facilities for plunder which surrounded them on every side; nor\r\ncould it be expected that a man, after possessing himself of valuables,\r\nwould at once, or on the first favourable opportunity, deliver up\r\nhis booty to the properly-constituted authorities. This much may be\r\nconceded, and it will therefore not be a subject of wonder that all\r\nranks of the Delhi Force, with but few exceptions, availed themselves\r\nof the prize within their reach, and appropriated to their own use much\r\ntreasure which ought to have gone towards swelling the general fund.\r\n\r\nOne officer in command of a native regiment quartered his corps in a\r\nhouse which formerly belonged to one of the richest Princes in the city\r\nof Delhi. The place was full of riches of every kind, and it was the\r\npopular belief at the time throughout the army that the officer in\r\nquestion succeeded in obtaining two lakhs of rupees. Rumour also said\r\nthat a court of inquiry would be held to investigate the truth or\r\notherwise of this report, but, if such had been contemplated, it fell to\r\nthe ground; nor was any attempt made to induce the officer to disgorge\r\nhis plunder. I paid a visit to this mansion some time afterwards, and\r\ncan vouch for the thorough ransacking the place had received. Every room\r\nin the house had been pillaged, excavations had been made in the floors,\r\nand empty boxes lay in every direction.\r\n\r\nOther cases similar to that just mentioned were known to us at the\r\ntime, in which sums of money were appropriated only a little smaller in\r\namount, while of those which reached the value of £100 their name is\r\nlegion. Many men also there were who, at first swayed by moral scruples,\r\nas well as feeling reluctant to disobey the order which had been issued,\r\nrefrained from looting on their own account; but when they saw that\r\nofficers, even of the higher ranks, took possession of plunder, these\r\nscruples were cast to the winds--it was \"every man for himself, and the\r\nd--- l take the hindmost,\" and a general desire was evinced for each to\r\nenrich himself with the prize lying at his feet.\r\n\r\nOften, when wandering through the city in pursuit of plunder, I, in\r\ncompany with others, came across officers engaged in the same quest as\r\nourselves. These rencontres were most amusing, giving rise to mutual\r\ninterrogations and many jokes, each party affirming that looting was not\r\nthe object of their perambulations, but that they were only inspecting\r\nthe houses out of a feeling of curiosity. Up to this time I had not\r\nsucceeded in finding any articles of value, nor had I the remotest idea\r\nthat my acquaintance with a certain officer in the employ of the prize\r\nagents would put me in the way of acquiring a fair amount of the loot of\r\nDelhi. A few silver ornaments and a small bag of sicca rupees were all\r\nthat I had so far obtained, and I naturally felt desirous of increasing\r\nmy store, more especially when it was well known that many officers,\r\nmore fortunate and less scrupulous, had already made themselves masters\r\nof large quantities of valuable plunder.\r\n\r\nThe accumulation of prize by the agents began shortly after Delhi was\r\ntaken. At first the articles obtained were of little worth, comprising\r\nchiefly wearing apparel of every description and household goods. Soon,\r\nhowever, more costly effects were found by the searchers, and in a very\r\nshort time the rooms of the prize agents were filled with treasures of\r\nevery kind--jewellery and precious stones, diamonds, rubies, emeralds\r\nand pearls without number, from those as large as hen's eggs to the\r\nsmall species used for necklaces; gold ornaments, chains of the most\r\nbeautiful workmanship, bracelets and bangles all of solid metal. There\r\nwere heaps, also, of the small, thick, native coin known as gold mohurs,\r\nthousands of which were accumulated by the prize agents and helped most\r\nmaterially to swell the amount. I visited one room, the long table\r\nin which literally groaned with the riches of \"Ormuz and of Ind\"--a\r\ndazzling sight to the eye, and one calculated to raise the spirit\r\nof greed in my breast to possess myself of some of the treasures so\r\ntemptingly exposed to view. When quiet returned, and the inhabitants of\r\nthe city began to flock back to their former homes, whole streets, in\r\nwhich no doubt treasure had been concealed and had escaped the search of\r\nthe prize agents, were sold to the people for sums ranging from 5,000 to\r\n50,000 rupees. All this helped to increase the prize to a sum which\r\nwas variously estimated at from half to three-quarters of a million\r\nsterling; and even then it was asserted that only a portion of the vast\r\nwealth of Delhi had been found.\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, the Government, when distributing the prize-money in\r\ntwo installments--in 1862 and again in 1865--gave no account of the\r\ntotal amount which had been collected. The private soldier's share was\r\nreckoned as the unit, value about £17, increasing according to the pay\r\nof the different ranks--the Ensign five shares, Lieutenant six and a\r\nhalf, Captain eleven and a half, and so in proportion among the higher\r\ngrade of officers, while that of the Commander-in-Chief amounted to\r\none-sixteenth of the whole--an immense sum. There were, of course, many\r\nexaggerations as to how much each rank would receive as its share, and\r\nthere were many heart-burnings also when the true amount became known.\r\nThe sum had dwindled down to less than one-third of what we expected,\r\nand not a few expressed openly their conviction that some tampering\r\nhad taken place with regard to the distribution. This can hardly be\r\nbelieved, though it has always been a notorious fact that the Government\r\nare inclined to treat the claims of those who fight their battles with\r\nneglect, and in one particular at least, by repudiating the 5 per cent,\r\npromised till the Delhi prize-money was paid, they acted up to their\r\nusual unjust policy, and gave occasions for the complaints which were\r\nraised at the time.\r\n\r\nI will now proceed to give an account of my experience when acting as an\r\nassistant to an officer who was accredited by the prize agents with a\r\npermit to search for plunder. This officer, an old friend of mine, asked\r\nme to accompany him on his expeditions, saying also that he had no\r\nobjection to my helping myself in moderation to part of the loot which\r\nwe might happen to find. Carrying with us the necessary tools, such as\r\nhammers, spades, and pickaxes, we each day started--accompanied by\r\ntwo coolies--on our plundering excursions. For some days we were very\r\nunsuccessful, and for nearly a week only managed to gather together\r\nand transmit to the agents articles of little value. But, soon gaining\r\nexperience from continued practice, and taking note of the different\r\nhouses in which there was a likelihood of finding prize, we settled\r\ndown to a systematic course of search, which in the end proved highly\r\nremunerative. Scarcely anything of value was found lying about the\r\ndifferent rooms; these had been already gutted and the contents\r\ndestroyed by the soldiers, both European and native, who, since the day\r\nof assault, had roamed about the city. At the time we began our search\r\nall was comparatively quiet, and during our operations, such was the\r\nvast extent of the city and so numerous the buildings, that only on two\r\nor three occasions were we interrupted by parties engaged in the same\r\nquest as ourselves.\r\n\r\nMy companion was a good Hindustani scholar, and taking advantage of his\r\nproficiency in the language, he made a point of interviewing several\r\nnatives of the city, who, in the capacity of workmen in different\r\ntrades, were allowed in Delhi, and were employed in their several\r\noccupations. From one of these, a mason and builder, N--received\r\ninformation that a large quantity of treasure was concealed in the house\r\nof a former rich resident. This man had helped to secrete the hoard, and\r\non the promise of a small reward was willing to help us in unearthing\r\nthe booty.\r\n\r\nOne morning in the beginning of October, attended by the mason, and\r\ncarrying the necessary implements, we were taken to the house in\r\nquestion. This was a large building with a courtyard in the centre, the\r\nrooms of which showed the remains of luxury and wealth, but, as usual,\r\nhad been despoiled by the plunderers of our army. Every article was\r\nscattered about in dire confusion; there were piles of clothing and\r\nbedding; rich and ornamental stuffs were torn to pieces, and the\r\nhousehold furniture, broken up, was strewn about the courtyard. Our\r\nguide took us to a small room, about 80 feet square--in fact, it was the\r\ncloset of the establishment--the walls of which were whitewashed, the\r\nfloor being covered with a hard cement. Here, we were told, the treasure\r\nwas concealed under the flooring of the room, and we lost no time in\r\ncommencing operations, the mason assisting us. Picking through the\r\ncement, we came on a large flagstone, which we lifted out of the cavity.\r\nThen we dug a hole about 3 feet square, and the same depth in the loose\r\nearth, disclosing the mouth of a large earthenware _gharra_, or jar.\r\nLoosening the soil all around, we attempted to raise the jar out of the\r\nground, but all our efforts were unavailing--its great weight preventing\r\nus from lifting it one inch out of the bed. Then, trembling with\r\nexcitement, for we felt sure that a rich display would greet our eyes,\r\nwe began slowly to remove each article from the _gharra_, and place it\r\non the floor of the room. A heavy bag lying at the mouth of the jar\r\nwas first taken out, and on opening it, and afterwards counting its\r\ncontents, we found that it contained 700 native gold mohurs, worth\r\nnearly £1,200. Then came dozens of gold bangles, or anklets, of pure\r\nmetal, such as those worn by dancing-girls. We were fairly bewildered at\r\nthe sight, our hands trembling and our eyes ablaze with excitement, for\r\nsuch an amount of pure gold as that already discovered we had never seen\r\nbefore. But the treasure was not yet half exhausted. The jar seemed a\r\nperfect mine of wealth--gold chains, plain and of filigree workmanship,\r\neach worth from £10 to £30; ornaments of the same metal of every sort\r\nof design, and executed in a style for which the Delhi jewellers are\r\ncelebrated all over India. Then came small silver caskets filled with\r\npearls, together to the number of more than 200, each worth from £3 to\r\n£4, pierced for stringing. Others, containing small diamonds, rubies,\r\nand emeralds, and the greatest prize of all--reclining in a casket by\r\nitself--a large diamond, which was sold afterwards by the prize agents\r\nfor £1,000. There were many other articles of value besides those I have\r\nmentioned--gold rings and tiaras inlaid with precious stones, nose-rings\r\nof the kind worn by women through the nostrils, earrings, bracelets, and\r\nnecklaces of small pearls without number.\r\n\r\nAll these various articles we spread out on the floor of the room,\r\nexamining each again and again, and with avaricious thoughts intent,\r\nlamenting that we were not allowed to appropriate what would have been\r\nto us a fortune. Truly such a temptation to enrich themselves without\r\nfear of detection was never till this occasion set before two\r\nimpecunious subalterns of the British Army. Here, spread out before us,\r\nlay loot to the value of thousands of pounds, all our own were we to\r\nfollow the example of some who had already feathered their nests with\r\nmuch larger amounts, defying those in authority to take the plunder from\r\nthem. However, such a course could not be entertained for one moment,\r\nand, moreover, were we to possess ourselves of all the contents of\r\nthe jar, there was no secure place of concealment to be found, and\r\nunpleasant inquiries and prying eyes would soon have revealed to the\r\nworld our abduction of the booty.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to do more than guess at the value of the plunder\r\nacquired on this day. My friend received a reward for the find; as for\r\nmyself, I will leave it to my readers whether it was possible for weak\r\nhuman nature to resist the temptation of carrying away some few mementos\r\nfrom this miscellaneous collection of treasure-trove. To tell the\r\ntruth, I must confess that in after times my only regret was that I had\r\nfoolishly let slip an opportunity of enriching myself which could never\r\nrecur. We agreed--and in this we were borne out by the prize agent--that\r\n£7,000 was the lowest sum at which to compute the loot we had found.\r\n\r\nIt was my invariable custom to wear as a kammerband or girdle folds of\r\nmuslin round my waist for the protection of the liver and spleen, and in\r\nthis I placed the articles I carried away. My friend procured a small\r\ncart, in which he deposited the loot and drove to the house of one of\r\nthe agents, while I, encumbered as I was, with difficulty mounted my\r\nhorse and rode towards the magazine. I could not but feel nervous and\r\nabashed when thinking of the riches concealed about my person, at last\r\nworking myself up to such a pitch of excitement that I imagined all I\r\nmet were cognizant of my good fortune; and on entering the gates of the\r\nmagazine, I fancied I heard one of our men say to his comrade, \"Well!\r\nthat fellow, at any rate, has plenty of loot about him.\"\r\n\r\nOur next great find, though by no means so lucrative as the first,\r\nbrought a large accession to the prize fund. It occurred to me, through\r\ncalling to recollection the story of the treasures concealed in the\r\nHindoo idol at Somnath which was broken open by Sultan Mahmoud in the\r\neleventh century, that possibly the same kind of receptacle might\r\ndisclose a like prize, though on a smaller scale, among the numerous\r\ntemples scattered through the city of Delhi.\r\n\r\nActing on this idea, we one day entered a small Hindoo temple situated\r\nnot far from the Chandni Chauk. The shrine was gaudily decorated; but\r\nafter a prolonged search, we found nothing of any value. A hideous idol\r\nstood on a raised structure in the centre of the building, and was soon\r\ndemolished in iconoclastic style with our hammers. The base of the idol\r\nwas formed of _chunam_ (a kind of cement), and into this we dug with\r\nour small pickaxes. Soon a ringing sound from a blow disclosed a large\r\nsilver casket imbedded in the _chunam_, and this, after some little\r\ntrouble, we extricated from its position. Forcing the casket open, our\r\nsight was regaled by a brilliant show of jewels and gold--diamonds,\r\nrubies, and emeralds--two of the latter species being uncut, but of\r\ngreat size, pearls larger than any we had yet seen, and gold ornaments\r\nof every description, chains, bracelets, bangles, and a few gold mohurs.\r\nWe were quite alone in the temple, and after feasting our eyes on the\r\ntreasures and selecting a few objects for our own benefit, N---- took\r\nthe casket to the prize agent, telling him where we had found it, and\r\nrecommending a search in such localities, which recommendation, no\r\ndoubt, was carried into effect among other Hindoo temples in the city.\r\n\r\nWhen first entering a house during our search, we at once made ourselves\r\nacquainted with the creed of its former inhabitants. In this there was\r\nno difficulty--Korans lying about the floor denoted that the occupants\r\nhad been Mussulmans, while many indications, such as idols, a different\r\narrangement of the furniture, and other signs with which we became\r\nconversant, proved the influence of the rival Hindoo race. There was a\r\nvery cogent reason for this investigation on our part--the Mohammedans\r\ninvariably, in secreting their valuables, placed them in the ground\r\nunder the floors of their houses, the Hindoos, on the other hand, always\r\nhid them in receptacles in the walls of the buildings. Armed with this\r\nknowledge, we used to sound either the floors or the walls of each house\r\naccording as the place belonged to one or the other creed; nor in one\r\nsingle instance, as far as I can remember, were we at fault in our\r\ndiagnosis.\r\n\r\nA favourite hiding-place for valuables was behind the staircase, the\r\ntreasure being concealed in a sort of vault built around with bricks and\r\ncement. On one occasion, in the house of a money-changer, we demolished\r\na secret place of this kind and discovered four large bags filled\r\nwith some heavy metal. Feeling convinced we should find that the bags\r\ncontained at the least rupees, we opened one, and to our infinite\r\ndisgust saw that the contents consisted of copper pieces called pice, of\r\nwhich there were many thousands; the bags, however, were taken to the\r\nprize agents, but I need scarcely say our hands on that day at least\r\nwere not soiled by appropriating a portion of the plunder.\r\n\r\nOn several occasions we succeeded in finding large stores of money,\r\nchiefly sicca or native rupees, while in the houses of Hindoos, in\r\nportions of the walls which sounded hollow under the blow of the hammer,\r\nwe, after making a hole sufficiently large for the passage of a hand,\r\nconstantly brought to light large stores of silver ornaments, consisting\r\nof chains, bracelets, etc., amounting in the aggregate to a barrowful.\r\nFew houses there were that did not furnish, after a diligent search\r\neither in the floors or walls, some articles of value; but on only one\r\noccasion after the successful ventures in the two first cases was the\r\namount of loot in any way comparable to that which we obtained on those\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nIn a very secluded part of the city, in a large house, surrounded by\r\nwretched tenements inhabited by the lowest class, we opened a door, and\r\nto our amazement entered a room furnished in the European fashion. This\r\nalso had not escaped the marauding and destructive hands of parties of\r\nplunderers; the furniture was smashed, and the contents of the room\r\nstrewn about the floor. There were English chairs, curtains, ottomans\r\ncovered with antimacassars, sofas and broken mirrors, and in the corner\r\na small piano, ruined and destroyed. The house had evidently belonged\r\nto some rich native, but who had been the occupant of this boudoir? for\r\nsuch it was--a miniature drawing-room filled with European luxuries, not\r\nexcepting books and copies of music. Articles of a lady's apparel also\r\nlay about, torn in shreds, vases were on the mantelpiece, as well as\r\na small box filled with English fancy needlework. We came to the\r\nconclusion that the mistress of this abode must have been a Eurasian\r\nlady, probably one of the zenana of the master of the house, who during\r\nthe exodus from the city had fled with, or been forcibly carried away\r\nby, her protector.\r\n\r\nA dismal mishap occurred to me in this room. Choosing a\r\ncomfortable-looking ottoman, I sat down, little dreaming that I had\r\nfallen into a trap which would occasion much laughter among my friends\r\nfor days to come. Feeling a strange moist sensation in a certain portion\r\nof my body, I jumped up from the seat, to find, to my horror, that I had\r\nplumped down on a quantity of ghee, or clarified butter. A jar of ghee\r\nwas lying on the floor, and a portion of this horrible mess had been\r\nspilt on the seat of the ottoman. I was dressed in white trousers and\r\njacket of the same material, and found, to my intense disgust, that the\r\nghee had left a large patch of colour which no amount of rubbing would\r\neradicate. We were far from our quarters, it was broad daylight, and,\r\nto my mortification, I was compelled to walk thus branded through the\r\nstreets of the city, the laughing-stock of those who saw the plight I\r\nwas in.\r\n\r\nDelhi was celebrated for miniature paintings done on talc, hundreds of\r\nwhich were found at this time. Some were of rare workmanship, portraits\r\nof beautiful women and drawings of celebrated buildings, all executed\r\nin a style of art peculiar to the craftsmen of that place. We were\r\nfortunate, during our search, in coming across the house of one of\r\nthese artists and disinterring from its concealment a box full of these\r\npaintings. They afterwards sold at a good price, and I possessed myself\r\nof some twenty of the most beautiful, comprising portraits of Zeenat\r\nMahal, the favourite wife of the King, other ladies of the zenana, and\r\npictures of the Taj and Jama Masjid, besides other mosques throughout\r\nIndia. These oval-shaped miniatures mounted in gold formed most\r\nacceptable souvenirs of the city of Delhi, and one in particular,\r\ncontaining the portrait of a lovely Eastern face with head-dress and\r\ntiara of diamonds, and strings of pearls round the neck, I was offered\r\n£20 for after it had been set in gold by a jeweller at Plymouth. In\r\nLondon, in 1858, there was a great demand for gold ornaments and\r\njewellery from Delhi, so much so that a noted goldsmith offered me\r\nthe highest price for articles of that description; nor would he at\r\nfirst--till convinced--accept my assurance that I had parted with all my\r\nDelhi loot before leaving India.\r\n\r\nWe were occupied for nearly three weeks in our quest for plunder,\r\nengaged in the exciting work almost every day, and seldom failing to\r\nfind some articles of value. Our last adventure in that line deserves\r\na detailed description, for though the nature of the loot obtained was\r\nsuch that it was useless to appropriate for our own use any of the goods\r\nfound, still, the value of the plunder increased to a large extent the\r\nDelhi prize-money.\r\n\r\nWe had noticed in the room of the agents piles of kincob, or cloth of\r\ngold, worth I fear to say how many rupees a yard. The manufacture of\r\nthis material was carried on to a great extent in Delhi, there being\r\nmuch demand for the rich and costly fabric among the Princes and nobles\r\nof Hindostan. Hitherto in our ramblings through the houses we had only\r\ncome across a few pieces of this gold brocade; but as luck would have\r\nit, on the last day in which I joined N---- in his duties he had\r\nreceived information from a native that a large store of kincob was\r\nconcealed in the house of a merchant who had dealt in that material.\r\n\r\nThe man guided us to the house in question; but after searching in every\r\nimaginable place, no signs of the gold cloth could be found. From the\r\nname of the merchant and certain other well-known indications we felt\r\nconvinced that his goods were concealed underground, and we commenced\r\ntapping the floor of the largest room with our hammers. Presently, in\r\nthe very centre of the apartment, there came a hollow sound, and digging\r\ndown about a foot, we found a trap-door. This was lifted, disclosing\r\na wooden staircase leading down to what seemed to us an apartment\r\nconcealed in Cimmerian darkness. Lighting the wax candles we always\r\ncarried about with us, we for some distance descended the steps which\r\nseemed to lead into the bowels of the earth. The room turned out to be\r\nabout twenty feet square and ten feet high, and ranged around, piled one\r\non top of the other, were scores of large boxes. One of these we opened,\r\nand found it to contain kincob of the rarest kind; others that we\r\nlooked into were full of the same gorgeous material, and we came to the\r\nconclusion that here, spread about, there was a treasure the value of\r\nwhich amounted to a lakh of rupees. Four large carts were loaded with\r\nthe boxes and taken to the prize agents, the contents selling afterwards\r\nfor a very large sum.\r\n\r\nAnd thus ended in a most successful find my connection with the loot of\r\nDelhi. Though many years have elapsed, the events of those three weeks\r\nseem as vivid in my memory as though they had happened yesterday--the\r\nbrightness of the jewels, the dazzling gold, the nerves wrought to the\r\nhighest pitch of tension while waiting in eager expectation for the\r\nresult of a search. These episodes of my life appear more like a\r\nfairytale or a legend of the \"Arabian Nights\" than true history and\r\nsober reality. What opportunities of accumulating a small fortune were\r\nthrown in my way! The treasure lay at my feet, only wanting to be picked\r\nup, and many will say that I was a fool not to take advantage of the\r\nprize! I can, however, certainly aver that I showed great moderation in\r\npossessing myself of only a small portion of the plunder--the amount I\r\nappropriated was but an infinitesimal part of the Delhi prize money.\r\nIt is very unlikely that Delhi or any other rich city in India will\r\nbe given over to sack and pillage, during this generation, but the\r\nremembrance of the days of 1857, and of the traditional wealth of\r\nthe country, still exists amongst the nations of the East, and only\r\nrecently, during the scare arising out of the Russian occupation of\r\nMerv, it was stated that the Turkomans, now feudatories of that Empire,\r\ncast longing eyes on Hindostan, \"where gold and diamonds could be picked\r\nup in the streets of the large cities.\"\r\n\r\nDuring my stay at Umballah I made arrangements with an officer of the\r\nCivil Service for the sale of the loot I had brought from Delhi. He\r\nentrusted the commission to one of his native writers, who executed the\r\nwork in a satisfactory manner, though the price I received was hardly\r\nequal to the amount I had anticipated. To my friend's wife I gave a\r\nfiligree gold chain of beautiful workmanship, and of such length that it\r\nreached six times round the neck, also a tiara of precious stones, while\r\nI also presented some pearls and gold mohurs. There is no doubt that,\r\nhad I brought the whole of my plunder home to England, the price\r\nobtained for it would have been far in excess of what I received at\r\nUmballah, but the risk of transportation was too great; I feared, also,\r\nthe chance of robbery and the anxiety attached to carrying about with me\r\nso many articles of value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAFGHANS: their
