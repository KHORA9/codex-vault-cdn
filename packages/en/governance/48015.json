I will try and send you an incoherent\r\nline to-day; for the smallest endeavor at coherence will bring me into\r\nthat atmosphere of astonishment again, in which I find no expression.\r\n\r\nYou northern Protestant people are always overrating the value of\r\nProtestantism as such. Your poetical clergymen make sentimental tours\r\nin the Vaudois country, as if there were no worthy people in the Alps\r\nbut the Vaudois. Did the enlightened Edinburgh evangelicals never take\r\nany interest in the freedom of the Swiss, nor hear of such people\r\nas Winkelried or Tell? Not but that there is some chance of Tell\r\ndisappearing one of these days under acutest historical investigation.\r\n\r\nStill, he, or somebody else, verily got Switzerland rid of much evil,\r\nand made it capable of much good; and if you examine the influence of\r\nthe battles of Morgarten and Sempach on European history, you will find\r\nthey were good and true pieces of God's work.[2] Do people suppose\r\nthey were done by Protestants? Switzerland owes all that she is--all\r\nthat she is ever likely to be--to her stout and stern Roman Catholics,\r\nfaithful to their faith to this day--they, and the Tyrolese, about the\r\ntruest Roman Catholics in Christendom and certainly among its worthiest\r\npeople, though they laid your Zuingli and a good deal of ranting\r\nProtestantism which Zuingli in vain tried to make either rational or\r\ncharitable, dead together on the green meadows of Cappel, and though\r\nthe Tyrolese marksmen at this moment are following up their rifle\r\npractice to good purpose, and with good will, with your Vaudois hearts\r\nfor targets.\r\n\r\nThe amazement atmosphere keeps floating with its edges about me,\r\nthough I write on as fast as I can in hopes of keeping out of it. You\r\nScotch, and we English!! to keep up the miserable hypocrisy of calling\r\nourselves Protestants! And here have been two of the most powerful\r\nprotests (sealed with quite as much blood as is usually needed for such\r\ndocuments) that ever were made against the Papacy--one in 1848,[3]\r\nand one now--twenty thousand men or thereabouts lying, at this time\r\nbeing, in the form of torn flesh and shattered bones, among the rice\r\nmarshes of the Novarrese, and not one jot of our precious Protestant\r\nblood gone to the signature. Not so much as one noble flush of it,\r\nthat I can see, on our clay cheeks, besmirched, as they are, with\r\nsweat and smoke; but all for gold, and out of chimneys. Of sweat for\r\nbread that perishes not, or of the old Sinai smoke for honor of God's\r\nlaw, and revelation thereof--no drop nor shadow. Not so much as a\r\ncoroner's inquest on those dead bodies in the rice fields--dead men\r\nwho must have been murdered by somebody. If a drunken man falls in a\r\nditch, you will have your Dogberry and Verges talk over him by way\r\nof doing justice; but your twenty thousand--not drunken, but honest,\r\nrespectable, well-meaning, and serviceable men--are made rice manure\r\nof, and you think it is all right. We Protestants indeed! The Italians\r\nare Protestants, and in a measure the French--nay, even the Austrians\r\n(at all events those conical-hatted mountaineers), according to their\r\nunderstanding of the matter. What we are, Moloch or Mammon, or the\r\nProtestant devil make up of both, perhaps knows.\r\n\r\nDo not think I dislike the Austrians. I have great respect and\r\naffection for them, and I have seen more of them in familiar\r\nintercourse than most Englishmen. One of my best friends in Venice\r\nin the winter of 1849-50 was the Artillery officer who had directed\r\nthe fire on the side of Mestre in 1848. I have never known a nobler\r\nperson. Brave, kind, and gay--as gentle as a lamb, as playful as a\r\nkitten--knightly in courtesy and in all tones of thought--ready at any\r\ninstant to lay down his life for his country or his Emperor. He was\r\nby no means a rare instance either of gentleness or of virtue among\r\nthe men whom the Liberal portion of our English press represent as\r\nonly tyrants and barbarians. Radetzky himself was one of the kindest\r\nof men--his habitual expression was one of overflowing _bonhommie_,\r\nor of fatherly regard for the welfare of all around him. All who knew\r\nhim loved him. In little things his kindness was almost ludicrous. I\r\nsaw him at Verona run out of his own supper-room and return with a\r\nplate of soup in his hand, the waiters (his youngest aides-de-camp) not\r\nserving his lady guests fast enough to please him; yet they were nimble\r\nenough, as I knew in a race with two of them among the fire-flies\r\nby the Mincio, only the evening before. For a long time I regarded\r\nthe Austrians as the only protection of Italy from utter dissolution\r\n(such as that which, I see to-day, it is reported that the Tuscan army\r\nhas fallen into, left for five weeks to itself), and I should have\r\nlooked upon them as such still, if the Sardinian Government had not\r\nshown itself fit to take their place. And the moment that any Italian\r\nGovernment was able to take their place, the Austrians necessarily\r\nbecame an obstacle to Italian progress, for all their virtues are\r\nincomprehensible to the Italians, and useless to them. Unselfish\r\nindividually, the Austrians are nationally entirely selfish, and in\r\nthis consists, so far as it is truly alleged against them, their\r\nbarbarism. These men of whom I have been speaking would have given, any\r\nof them, life and fortune unhesitatingly, at their Emperor's bidding,\r\nbut their magnanimity was precisely that of the Highlander or the\r\nIndian, incognizant of any principle of action but that of devotion to\r\nhis chief or nation. All abstract grounds of conscience, all universal\r\nand human hopes, were inconceivable by them. Such men are at present\r\ncapable of no feeling towards Italy but scorn; their power was like\r\na bituminous cerecloth wrapping her corpse--it saved her from the\r\nrottenness of revolution; but it must be unwound, if the time has come\r\nfor her resurrection.\r\n\r\nI do not know if that time has come, or can come. Italy's true\r\noppression is all her own. Spain is oppressed by the Spaniard, not by\r\nthe Austrian. Greece needs but to be saved from the Greeks. No French\r\nEmperor, however mighty his arm or sound his faith, can give Italy\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\n    \"A gift of that which is not to be given\r\n    By all the associate powers of earth and heaven.\"\r\n\r\nBut the time is come at least to bid her be free, if she has the power\r\nof freedom. It is not England, certainly, who should forbid her. I\r\nbelieve that is what it will come to, however--not so much because we\r\nare afraid of Napoleon, as because we are jealous of him. But of him\r\nand us I have something more to say than there is time for to-night.\r\nThese good, stupid, affectionate, faithful Germans, too (grand fellows\r\nunder arms; I never imagined so magnificent a soldiery as 15,000 of\r\nthem which I made a shift to see, through sand clouds, march past the\r\nPrince Frederick William[4] on Saturday morning last). But to hear them\r\nfretting and foaming at the French getting into Milan!--they having\r\nabsolutely no other idea on all this complicated business than that\r\nFrench are fighting Germans! Wrong or right, why or wherefore, matters\r\nnot a jot to them. French are fighting Germans--somehow, somewhere,\r\nfor some reason--and beer and Vaterland are in peril, and the English\r\nin fault, as we are assuredly, but not on that side, for I believe\r\nit to be quite true which a French friend, high in position, says in\r\na letter this morning--\"If the English had not sympathized with the\r\nAustrians there would have been no war.\" By way of keeping up the\r\ncharacter of incoherence to which I have vowed myself, I may tell you\r\nthat before that French letter came, I received another from a very\r\nsagacious Scotch friend (belonging, as I suppose most Scotch people do,\r\nto the class of persons who call themselves \"religious\"), containing\r\nthis marvellous enunciation of moral principle, to be acted upon in\r\ndifficult circumstances, \"Mind your own business.\" It is a serviceable\r\nprinciple enough for men of the world, but a surprising one in the\r\nmouth of a person who professes to be a Bible obeyer. For, as far as\r\nI remember the tone of that obsolete book, \"our own\" is precisely the\r\nlast business which it ever tells us to mind. It tells us often to mind\r\nGod's business, often to mind other people's business; our own, in any\r\neager or earnest way, not at all. \"What thy hand findeth to do.\" Yes;\r\nbut in God's fields, not ours. One can imagine the wiser fishermen\r\nof the Galilean lake objecting to Peter and Andrew that they were\r\nnot minding their business, much more the commercial friends of Levi\r\nspeaking with gentle pity of him about the receipt of Custom. \"A bad\r\nman of business always--see what has come of it--quite mad at last.\"\r\n\r\nAnd my astonishing friend went on to say that this was to be our\r\nprinciple of action \"where the path was not quite clear\"--as if any\r\npath ever _was_ clear till you got to the end of it, or saw it a long\r\nway off; as if all human possibility of path was not among clouds and\r\nbrambles--often cold, always thorny--misty with roses occasionally, or\r\ndim with dew, often also with shadow of Death--misty, more particularly\r\nin England just now, with shadow of that commercially and otherwise\r\nvaluable smoke before spoken of.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the path is not to be seen, it may be felt, or at least\r\ntumbled off, without any particular difficulty. This latter course of\r\nproceeding is our probablest, of course.--But I can't write any more\r\nto-night. I am, etc.,\r\n\r\n                                                     J. RUSKIN.\r\n\r\n    _Note_ to p. 6.--The lines quoted are from Wordsworth's \"Poems\r\n    dedicated to National Independence and Liberty,\" Part II.,\r\n    Sonnet i. The second line should read, \"By all the blended\r\n    powers of earth and heaven.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] This and the two following letters deal, it will be seen, with \"the\r\nItalian question\" in 1859, when the peace of Europe was disturbed by\r\nthe combined action of France and Sardinia against Austria in the cause\r\nof Italian independence. Of these three letters the first was written\r\ntwo days after the defeat of the Austrians at Magenta, followed by the\r\nentrance into Milan of the French, and the second a few days before the\r\nsimilar victory of the French and Sardinian armies at Solferino.\r\n\r\n[2] Few readers need be reminded of the position of Tell in the list of\r\nSwiss patriots (_pace_ the \"acutest historical investigation,\" which\r\nputs him in the list of mythical personages) in the early part of the\r\nfourteenth century; of Arnold von Winkelried who met the heroic death,\r\nby which he secured his country's freedom, at Sempach in 1386; or of\r\nUlrich Zuingli, the Swiss Protestant leader of his time, who fell at\r\nCappel, in the war of the Reformed against the Romish cantons, in 1531.\r\nAt the battle of Morgarten, in 1315, twenty thousand Austrians were\r\ndefeated by no more than thirteen hundred Swiss, with such valor that\r\nthe name of the victors' canton was thereupon extended to the whole\r\ncountry, thenceforth called Switzerland.\r\n\r\nIt may be further noted that Arnold of Sempach is, with Leonidas,\r\nCurtius, and Sir Richard Grenville, named amongst the types of \"the\r\ndivinest of sacrifices, that of the patriot for his country,\" in Mr.\r\nRuskin's Preface, \"Bibliotheca Pastorum,\" Vol. i. p. xxxiii.\r\n\r\n[3] The year of the Lombard insurrection, when Radetzky, the Austrian\r\nfield-marshal, defeated the insurgents at Custozza near Verona.\r\nRadetzky died in 1858.\r\n\r\n[4] The Prince Frederick William, now Emperor of Germany (having\r\nsucceeded his brother Frederick William IV. in January, 1861), was at\r\nthe date of this letter Regent of Prussia, and Commander-in-chief of\r\nthe Prussian forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From the \"Scotsman,\" July 23, 1859.]\r\n\r\n_THE ITALIAN QUESTION._\r\n\r\n                                        BERLIN, _June_ 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou would have had this second letter sooner, had I not lost myself,\r\nafter despatching the first, in farther consideration of the theory\r\nof Non-Intervention, or minding one's own business. What, in logical\r\nterms, _is_ the theory? If one sees a costermonger wringing his\r\ndonkey's tail, is it proper to \"intervene\"? and if one sees an Emperor\r\nor a System wringing a nation's neck, is it improper to intervene? Or\r\nis the Intervention allowable only in the case of hides, not of souls?\r\nfor even so, I think you might find among modern Italians many quite as\r\ndeserving of intervention as the donkey. Or is interference allowable\r\nwhen one person does one wrong to another person, but not when two\r\npersons do two wrongs to two, or three to three, or a multitude to\r\na multitude; and is there any algebraic work on these square and\r\ncube roots of morality wherein I may find how many coadjutors or\r\ncommissions any given crooked requires to make it straight? Or is it a\r\ngeographical question; and may one advisably interfere at Berwick but\r\nnot at Haddington? Or is there any graduated scale of intervention,\r\npracticable according to the longitude? I see my way less clearly,\r\nbecause the illustrations of the theory of Non-intervention are\r\nas obscure as its statement. The French are at present happy and\r\nprosperous; content with their ruler and themselves; their trade\r\nincreasing, and their science and art advancing; their feelings towards\r\nother nations becoming every day more just. Under which circumstances\r\nwe English non-interventionalists consider it our duty to use every\r\nmeans in our power of making the ruler suspected by the nation, and the\r\nnation unmanageable by the ruler. We call both all manner of names;\r\nexhaust every term of impertinence and every method of disturbance; and\r\ndo our best, in indirect and underhand ways, to bring about revolution,\r\nassassination, or any other close of the existing system likely to be\r\nsatisfactory to Royals[5] in general. This is your non-intervention\r\nwhen a nation is prosperous.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Italian nation is unhappy and unprosperous;\r\nits trade annihilated, its arts and sciences retrograde, its nerve\r\nand moral sense prostrated together; it is capable only of calling to\r\nyou for help, and you will not help it. The man you have been calling\r\nnames, with his unruly colonels, undertakes to help it, and Christian\r\nEngland, with secret hope that, in order to satisfy her spite against\r\nthe unruly colonels, the French army may be beaten, and the Papacy\r\nfully established over the whole of Italy--Christian England, I say,\r\nwith this spiteful jealousy for one of her motives, and a dim, stupid,\r\nshort-sighted, sluggish horror of interruption of business for the\r\nother, takes, declaratively and ostensibly, this highly Christian\r\nposition. \"Let who will prosper or perish, die or live--let what will\r\nbe declared or believed--let whatsoever iniquity be done, whatsoever\r\ntyranny be triumphant, how many soever of faithful or fiery soldiery\r\nbe laid in new embankments of dead bodies along those old embankments\r\nof Mincio and Brenta; yet will we English drive our looms, cast up our\r\naccounts, and bet on the Derby, in peace and gladness; our business\r\nis only therewith; for us there is no book of fate, only ledgers and\r\nbetting-books; for us there is no call to meddle in far-away business.\r\nSee ye to it. We wash our hands of it in that sea-foam of ours; surely\r\nthe English Channel is better than Abana and Pharpar, or than the\r\nsilver basin which Pilate made use of, and our soap is of the best\r\nalmond-cake.\"\r\n\r\nI hear the Derby was great this year.[6] I wonder, sometimes, whether\r\nanybody has ever calculated, in England, how much taxation the nation\r\npays annually for the maintenance of that great national institution.\r\nObserve--what I say of the spirit in which the English bear themselves\r\nat present, is founded on what I myself have seen and heard, not on\r\nwhat I read in journals. I read them little at home--here I hardly see\r\nthem. I have no doubt that in the Liberal papers one might find much\r\nmouthing about liberty, as in the Conservative much about order, it\r\nbeing neither liberty nor order which is wanted, but Justice. You may\r\nhave Freedom of all Abomination, and Order of all Iniquity--if you\r\nlook for Forms instead of Facts. Look for the facts first--the doing\r\nof justice howsoever and by whatsoever forms or informalities. And the\r\nforms will come--shapely enough, and sightly enough, afterwards. Yet,\r\nperhaps, not till long afterwards. Earnest as I am for the freedom\r\nof Italy, no one can hope less from it, for many a year to come.\r\nEven those Vaudois, whom you Presbyterians admire so much, have made\r\nas yet no great show of fruit out of their religious freedom. I went\r\nup from Turin to Torre di Lucerna to look at them last year. I have\r\nseldom slept in a dirtier inn, seldom seen peasants' cottages so ill\r\nbuilt, and never yet in my life saw anywhere paths so full of nettles.\r\nThe faces of the people are interesting, and their voices sweet,\r\nexcept in howlings on Sunday evening, which they performed to a very\r\ndisquieting extent in the street till about half-past ten, waking me\r\nafterwards between twelve and one with another \"catch,\" and a dance\r\nthrough the village of the liveliest character. Protestantism is apt\r\nsometimes to take a gayer character abroad than with us. Geneva has\r\nan especially disreputable look on Sunday evenings, and at Hanover I\r\nsee the shops are as wide open on Sunday as Saturday; here, however,\r\nin Berlin, they shut up as close as you do at Edinburgh. I think\r\nthe thing that annoyed me most at La Tour, however, was the intense\r\nsectarianism of the Protestant dogs. I can make friends generally,\r\nfast enough, with any canine or feline creature; but I could make\r\nnothing of those evangelical brutes, and there was as much snarling and\r\nyelping that afternoon before I got past the farmhouses to the open\r\nhill-side, as in any of your Free Church discussions. It contrasted\r\nvery painfully with the behavior of such Roman Catholic dogs as I\r\nhappen to know--St. Bernard's and others--who make it their business\r\nto entertain strangers. But the hill-side was worth reaching--for\r\nthough that Lucerna valley is one of the least interesting I ever saw\r\nin the Alps, there is a craggy ridge on the north of it which commands\r\na notable view. In about an hour and a half's walking you may get up\r\nto the top of a green, saddle-shaped hill, which separates the Lucerna\r\nvalley from that of Angrogna; if then, turning to the left (westward),\r\nyou take the steepest way you can find up the hill, another couple of\r\nhours will bring you to a cone of stones which the shepherds have built\r\non the ridge, and there you may see all the historical sites of the\r\nvalley of Angrogna as in a map--and as much of Monte Viso and Piedmont\r\nas clouds will let you. I wish I could draw you a map of Piedmont\r\nas I saw it that afternoon. The air was half full of white cumulus\r\nclouds, lying nearly level about fifteen hundred feet under the ridge;\r\nand through every gap of them a piece of Piedmont with a city or two.\r\nTurin, twenty-eight miles away as the bird flies, shows through one\r\ncloud-opening like a handful of golden sand in a pool of blue sea.\r\n\r\nI've no time to write any more to-day, for I've been to Charlottenburg,\r\nout of love for Queen Louise.[7] I can't see a good painting of her\r\nanywhere, and they show her tomb by blue light, like the nun scene in\r\n_Robert le Diable_. A German woman's face, if beautiful at all, is\r\nexquisitely beautiful; but it depends mainly on the thoughtfulness of\r\nthe eyes, and the bright hair. It rarely depends much upon the nose,\r\nwhich has perhaps a tendency to be--if anything--a little too broadish\r\nand flattish--perhaps one might even say in some cases, knobbish. (The\r\nHartz mountains, I see, looking at them from Brunswick, have similar\r\ntendencies, less excusably and more decidedly.) So when the eyes are\r\nclosed--and for the soft hair one has only furrowed marble--and the\r\nnose to its natural disadvantages adds that of being seen under blue\r\nlight, the general effect is disappointing.\r\n\r\nFrederick the Great's celebrated statue is at the least ten yards too\r\nhigh[8] from the ground to be of any use; one sees nothing but the\r\nedges of the cloak he never wore, the soles of his boots, and, in a\r\nredundant manner, his horse's tail. Under which vertically is his\r\nApotheosis. In which process he sits upon the back of an eagle, and\r\nwaves a palm, with appearance of satisfaction to himself, and it is to\r\nbe hoped no danger of any damage to three stars in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nKiss's Amazon makes a good grotesque for the side of the Museum steps;\r\nit was seen to disadvantage in London. The interior of the gallery is\r\nvery beautiful in many ways; and Holbein's portrait of George Gyzen is\r\nworth coming all the way from England to see only ten minutes. I never\r\nsaw so noble a piece of work of its kind in my life.\r\n\r\n  Believe me, etc.,\r\n                            J.

I am obliged by the admission of the letter into your columns;\r\nand I should have been glad to continue in those columns the series I\r\nintended, had not the refusal of this letter by the _Witness_[9] shown\r\nme the liability to misapprehension under which I should be writing.\r\nI had thought that, seeing for these twenty years I have been more or\r\nless conversant with Italy and the Italians, a few familiar letters\r\nwritten to a personal friend, at such times as I could win from my\r\nown work, might not have been uninteresting to Scottish readers, even\r\nthough my opinions might occasionally differ sharply from theirs, or\r\nbe expressed in such rough way as strong opinions must be, when one\r\nhas no time to polish them into more pleasing presentability. The\r\nrefusal of the letter by the _Witness_ showed me that this was not\r\nso; and as I have no leisure to take up the subject methodically, I\r\nmust leave what I have written in its present imperfect form. It is\r\nindeed not mainly a question of time, which I would spend gladly,\r\nthough to handle the subject of the present state of Italy with any\r\ncompleteness would involve a total abandonment of other work for some\r\nweeks. But I feel too deeply in this matter to allow myself to think of\r\nit continuously. To me, the state of the modern political mind, which\r\nhangs the slaughter of twenty thousand men, and the destinies of twenty\r\nmyriads of human souls, on the trick that transforms a Ministry, or the\r\nchances of an enlarged or diminished interest in trade, is something\r\nso horrible that I find no utterance wherewith to characterize it--nor\r\nany courage wherewith to face the continued thought of it, unless I\r\nhad clear expectation of doing good by the effort--expectation which\r\nthe mere existence of the fact forbids. I leave therefore the words I\r\nhave written to such work as they may; hoping, indeed, nothing from\r\nany words; thankful, if a few people here and there understand and\r\nsympathize in the feelings with which they were written; and thankful,\r\nif none so sympathize, that I am able at least to claim some share in\r\nthe sadness, though not in the triumph, of the words of Farinata--\r\n\r\n    \"Fu' io sol colà, dove sofferto\r\n    Fu per ciascun di torre via Fiorenza,\r\n    Colui che la difese a viso aperto.\"[10]\r\n\r\n                                         I am, etc., J.

It\r\nseems, however, that the two preceding letters had been sent to the\r\n_Witness_, which printed the first and refused to print the second.\r\nThe _Scotsman_ printed both under the titles of \"Mr. Ruskin on the\r\nItalian Question,\" and \"Mr. Ruskin on Foreign Politics,\" whilst it\r\ndistinguished this third letter by the additional heading of \"Letter\r\nto the Editor.\" It may be conjectured, therefore, that the first two\r\nletters were reprinted by the _Scotsman_ from another paper, and that,\r\nin receiving the number of the _Scotsman_ containing the second, Mr.\r\nRuskin did not know that it had reprinted the first also. As to the\r\n\"series begun in another journal,\" it is, I think, clear that it had\r\nnot been long continued, as the letter dated \"June 15,\" sent to and\r\nrefused by it, is spoken of as \"the second letter,\" so that that dated\r\n\"June 6\" must have been the first, as this was unquestionably the last\r\nof the series.\r\n\r\n[10]\r\n\r\n    \"But singly there I stood, when, by consent\r\n    Of all, Florence had to the ground been razed,\r\n    The one who openly forbade the deed.\"\r\n\r\nCARY'S DANTE--\"L'Inferno,\" x.

My health\r\ndoes not now admit of my taking part frequently in public business;\r\nyet I should have held it a duty to accept the invitation of the\r\ndirectors of the Liverpool Institute, but that, for the time being, my\r\ntemper is at fault, as well as my health; and I am wholly unable to\r\ngo on with any of my proper work, owing to the horror and shame with\r\nwhich I regard the political position taken, or rather sunk into, by\r\nEngland in her foreign relations--especially in the affairs of Italy\r\nand Poland.[12] What these matters have to do with Art may not at\r\nfirst be clear, but I can perhaps make it so by a short similitude.\r\nSuppose I had been engaged by an English gentleman to give lectures on\r\nArt to his son. Matters at first go smoothly, and I am diligent in my\r\ndefinitions of line and color, until, one Sunday morning at breakfast\r\ntime, a ticket-of-leave man takes a fancy to murder a girl in the road\r\nleading round the lawn, before the house-windows. My patron, hearing\r\nthe screams, puts down his paper, adjusts his spectacles, slowly\r\napprehends what is going on, and rings the bells for his smallest\r\nfootman. \"John, take my card and compliments to that gentleman outside\r\nthe hedge, and tell him that his proceedings are abnormal, and, I may\r\nadd, to me personally--offensive. Had that road passed through my\r\nproperty, I should have felt it my duty to interfere.\" John takes the\r\ncard, and returns with it; the ticket-of-leave man finishes his work at\r\nhis leisure; but, the screams ceasing as he fills the girl's mouth with\r\nclay, the English gentleman returns to his muffins, and congratulates\r\nhimself on having \"kept out of that mess.\" Presently afterwards he\r\nsends for me to know if I shall be ready to lecture on Monday. I am\r\nsomewhat nervous, and answer--I fear rudely--\"Sir, your son is a good\r\nlad; I hope he will grow to be a man--but, for the present, I cannot\r\nteach him anything. I should like, indeed, to teach _you_ something,\r\nbut have no words for the lesson.\" Which indeed I have not. If I say\r\nany words on such matters, people ask me, \"Would I have the country\r\ngo to war? do I know how dreadful a thing war is?\" Yes, truly, I know\r\nit. I like war as ill as most people--so ill, that I would not spend\r\ntwenty millions a year in making machines for it, neither my holidays\r\nand pocket money in playing at it; yet I would have the country go to\r\nwar, with haste, in a good quarrel; and, which is perhaps eccentric in\r\nme, rather in another's quarrel than in her own. We say of ourselves\r\ncomplacently that we will not go to war for an idea; but the phrase\r\ninterpreted means only, that we will go to war for a bale of goods,\r\nbut not for justice nor for mercy; and I would ask you to favor me so\r\nfar as to read this letter to the students at your meeting, and say\r\nto them that I heartily wish them well; but for the present I am too\r\nsad to be of any service to them; that our wars in China and Japan[13]\r\nare not likely to furnish good subjects for historical pictures; that\r\n\"ideas\" happen, unfortunately, to be, in Art, the principal things; and\r\nthat a country which will not fight for its ideas is not likely to have\r\nanything worth painting.\r\n\r\n            I have the honor to be, Sir, your faithful servant,\r\n                                                       J.

It was subsequently read on the occasion of\r\ndistribution, in accordance with the wish expressed towards the end of\r\nthe letter.\r\n\r\n[12] See the preceding and the following letter. This one was, it will\r\nbe seen, written in the year of the last great struggle of Poland\r\nagainst Russia.\r\n\r\n[13] A The expedition of the English and French against China was begun\r\nin the August of 1860; the war in Japan in the summer of 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From \"The Morning Post,\" July 7, 1864.]\r\n\r\n_THE POSITION OF DENMARK._\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of_ \"_The Morning Post_.\"\r\n\r\nSIR: Will you allow me, in fewest words, to say how deeply I concur in\r\nall that is said in that noble letter of Lord Townshend's published\r\nin your columns this morning--except only in its last sentence, \"It\r\nis time to protest.\"[14] Alas! if protests were of any use, men with\r\nhearts and lips would have protested enough by this time. But they\r\nare of none, and can be of none. What true words are worth any man's\r\nutterance, while it is possible for such debates as last Monday's to\r\nbe, and two English gentlemen can stand up before the English Commons\r\nto quote Virgil at each other, and round sentences, and show their\r\nfineness of wrist in their pretty little venomous carte and tierce of\r\npersonality, while, even as they speak, the everlasting silence is\r\nwrapping the brave massacred Danes?[15] I do not know, never shall\r\nknow, how this is possible. If a cannon shot carried off their usher's\r\nhead, nay, carried off but his rod's head, at their room door, they\r\nwould not round their sentences, I fancy, in asking where the shot\r\ncame from; but because these infinite masses of advancing slaughter\r\nare a few hundred miles distant from them, they can speak their stage\r\nspeeches out in content. Mr. Gladstone must go to places, it seems,\r\nbefore he can feel! Let him go to Alsen, as he went to Naples,[16]\r\nand quote Virgil to the Prussian army. The English mind, judging by\r\nyour leaders, seems divided between the German-cannon nuisance and the\r\nSavoyard street-organ nuisance; but was there ever hurdy-gurdy like\r\nthis dissonance of eternal talk?[17] The Savoyard at least grinds his\r\nhandle one way, but these classical discords on the double pipe, like\r\nMr. Kinglake's two tunes--past and present[18]--on Savoy and Denmark,\r\nneed stricter police interference, it seems to me! The cession of\r\nSavoy was the peaceful present of a few crags, goats, and goatherds by\r\none king to another; it was also fair pay for fair work, and, in the\r\nprofoundest sense, no business of ours. Whereupon Mr. Kinglake mewed\r\nlike a moonstruck cat going to be made a mummy of for Bubastis. But we\r\nsaw the noble Circassian nation murdered, and never uttered word for\r\nthem. We saw the noble Polish nation sent to pine in ice, and never\r\nstruck blow for them. Now the nation of our future Queen calls to us\r\nfor help in its last agony, and we round sentences and turn our backs.\r\nSir, I have no words for these things, because I have no hope. It is\r\nnot these squeaking puppets who play before us whom we have to accuse;\r\nit is not by cutting the strings of them that we can redeem our deadly\r\nerror.\r\n\r\nWe English, as a nation, know not, and care not to know, a single broad\r\nor basic principle of human justice. We have only our instincts to\r\nguide us. We will hit anybody again who hits us. We will take care of\r\nour own families and our own pockets; and we are characterized in our\r\npresent phase of enlightenment mainly by rage in speculation, lavish\r\nexpenditure on suspicion or panic, generosity whereon generosity is\r\nuseless, anxiety for the souls of savages, regardlessness of those\r\nof civilized nations, enthusiasm for liberation of blacks, apathy\r\nto enslavement of whites, proper horror of regicide, polite respect\r\nfor populicide, sympathy with those whom we can no longer serve, and\r\nreverence for the dead, whom we have ourselves delivered to death.\r\n\r\n                     I am, Sir, your faithful servant,\r\n                                                      J.

To which side, I would\r\nask, do reason and justice incline?\" After commenting on the \"tardy\r\nconsolation for an evil which we have neglected to avert,\" and after\r\nremarking that \"in the national point of view the case of Poland is an\r\nexact counterpart to that of Circassia,\" the letter thus concluded:\r\n\"Against such a state of things it is surely time for all who feel as I\r\ndo to protest.\"\r\n\r\n[15] The debate (July 4, 1864) was upon the Danish question and\r\nthe policy of the Government, and took place just after the end\r\nof a temporary armistice and the resumption of hostilities by the\r\nbombardment of Alsen, in the Dano-Prussian war. Alsen was taken two\r\ndays after the publication of this letter. The \"two English gentlemen\"\r\nwere Mr. D'Israeli and Mr. Gladstone (at this time Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer), the latter of whom had quoted the lines from the sixth\r\nÆneid (ll. 489-491):\r\n\r\n    \"At Danaum proceres Agamemnoniæque phalanges\r\n    Ut vidêre virum fulgentiaque arma per umbras\r\n    Ingenti trepidare metu.\"\r\n\r\n[16] In 1850, when, being at Naples, Mr. Gladstone interested himself\r\ndeeply in the cause and miserable condition of the political prisoners,\r\nand subsequently addressed two letters on the subject to Lord Aberdeen\r\n(see \"Letters to Lord Aberdeen on the prisoners of the Neapolitan\r\nGovernment:\" Murray, 1851).\r\n\r\n[17] The _Morning Post_ of July 6 contained amongst its leaders one on\r\nDenmark and Germany, and another on London street-organs, the nuisance\r\nof which had been recently brought before the House of Commons by Mr.\r\nM. T. Bass (M.P. for Derby).\r\n\r\n[18] Mr. Alexander William Kinglake, M.P. for Bridgewater.

I am compelled to make this request, because I see\r\nmy friend Mr. Thomas Hughes has been abetting the Radical movement\r\nagainst Governor Eyre; and as I employed what little influence I have\r\nwith the London workmen to aid the return of Mr. Hughes for Lambeth,\r\nI may perhaps be thought to concur with him in every line of action\r\nhe may see fit subsequently to adopt. Permit me, then, once for all,\r\nthrough your widely-read columns, to say that I did what I could\r\ntowards the return both of Mr. J. S. Mill and of Mr. Hughes,[21] not\r\nbecause I held with them in all their opinions, or even in the main\r\nprinciple of their opinions, but because I knew they had a principle\r\nof opinions; that they were honest, thoughtful, and benevolent men;\r\nand far worthier to be in Parliament (even though it might be in\r\nopposition to many causes I had at heart) than any other candidates I\r\nknew. They are my opponents in many things, though I thought better of\r\nthem both than that they would countenance this fatuous outcry against\r\nGovernor Eyre. But in most directions of thought and action they\r\nare for Liberty, and I am for Lordship; they are Mob's men and I am\r\na King's man. Yes, sir, I am one of those almost forgotten creatures\r\nwho shrivel under your daily scorn; I am a \"Conservative,\" and hope\r\nforever to be a Conservative in the deepest sense--a Re-former, not a\r\nDe-former. Not that I like slavery, or object to the emancipation of\r\nany kind or number of blacks in due place and time. But I understand\r\nsomething more by \"slavery\" than either Mr. J. S. Mill or Mr. Hughes;\r\nand believe that white emancipation not only ought to precede, but must\r\nby law of all fate precede, black emancipation. I much dislike the\r\nslavery, to man, of an African laborer, with a spade on his shoulder;\r\nbut I more dislike the slavery, to the devil, of a Calabrian robber\r\nwith a gun on his shoulder. I dislike the American serf-economy, which\r\nseparates, occasionally, man and wife; but I more dislike the English\r\nserf-economy, which prevents men from being able to have wives at all.\r\nI dislike the slavery which obliges women (if it does) to carry their\r\nchildren over frozen rivers; but I more dislike the slavery which makes\r\nthem throw their children into wells. I would willingly hinder the\r\nselling of girls on the Gold Coast; but primarily, if I might, would\r\nhinder the selling of them in Mayfair. And, finally, while I regret\r\nthe need that may exist among savages in a distant island for their\r\ngovernor to do his work sharply and suddenly on them, I far more regret\r\nthe need among men of race and capacity for the work of governors when\r\nthey have no governor to give it them. Of all dishonorable and impious\r\ncaptivities of this age, the darkest was that of England to Russia, by\r\nwhich she was compelled to refuse to give Greece a King when Greece\r\nbesought one from her, and to permit that there should be set on the\r\nAcropolis throne no Governor Eyre, nor anything like him, but such\r\na shadow of King as the black fates cast upon a nation for a curse,\r\nsaying, \"Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child!\"[22]\r\n\r\nLet the men who would now deserve well of England reserve their\r\nimpeachments, or turn them from those among us who have saved colonies\r\nto those who have destroyed nations.\r\n\r\n                             I am, Sir, yours, etc.,\r\n                                                      J.

Mr. Ruskin attended and\r\nspoke at the meetings of the Eyre Defence Fund, to which Mr. Carlyle\r\n(see note at the end of this letter) gave his warm support. Amongst\r\nthose who most strongly deprecated the course taken by Governor Eyre\r\nwere, as this letter implies, Mr. John Stuart Mill (Chairman of the\r\nJamaica Committee) and Mr. Thomas Hughes.\r\n\r\n[20] Signed by 273 persons resident in and near Huddersfield.

Sec. of the \"Eyre Defence Fund\" (published in\r\nthe _Daily Telegraph_ of September 12, 1866), expressed himself as\r\nfollows: \"The clamor raised against Governor Eyre appears to me to\r\nbe disgraceful to the good sense of England; ... penalty and clamor\r\nare not the things this Governor merits from any of us, but honor and\r\nthanks, and wise imitation....

In the second, I know also that\r\nthe German armies will spare what they can, and think they ought,\r\nwithout taking advice of me. In the third, I have said long ago--no one\r\nlistening--the best I had to say on these matters.\r\n\r\nBut, after your notice to-day of the escape of M. Edouard Frère,[24]\r\nwhose gentle power I was, I believe, the first to recognize publicly in\r\nEngland, it is possible that some of your readers may care to look back\r\nat what I wrote of modern war four years ago, and to know the aspect it\r\ntakes to me, now that it has come to pass.\r\n\r\nIf you will reprint these few following sentences for me from the\r\n\"Crown of Wild Olive,\"[25] I shall be able to-morrow to put what I\r\nwould add to them briefly enough to claim little space in your columns:\r\n\r\nIf you have to take away masses of men from all industrial\r\nemployment--to feed them by the labor of others--to move them, and\r\nprovide them with destructive machines, varied daily in national\r\nrivalship of inventive cost; if you have to ravage the country which\r\nyou attack--to destroy, for a score of future years, its roads, its\r\nwoods, its cities, and its harbors; and if, finally, having brought\r\nmasses of men, counted by hundreds of thousands, face to face, you tear\r\nthose masses to pieces with jagged shot, and leave fragments of living\r\ncreatures, countlessly beyond all help of surgery, to starve and parch,\r\nthrough days of torture, down into clots of clay--what book of accounts\r\nshall record the cost of your work--what book of judgment sentence the\r\nguilt of it?\r\n\r\nThat, I say, is _modern_ war--scientific war--chemical and mechanical\r\nwar--worse even than the savage's poisoned arrow. And yet you will tell\r\nme, perhaps, that any other war than this is impossible now. It may be\r\nso; the progress of science cannot, perhaps, be otherwise registered\r\nthan by new facilities of destruction; and the brotherly love of our\r\nenlarging Christianity be only proved by multiplication of murder.\r\n\r\nBut the wonder has always been great to me that heroism has never been\r\nsupposed consistent with the practice of supplying people with food,\r\nor clothes, but only with that of quartering one's self upon them for\r\nfood, and stripping them of their clothes. Spoiling of armor is an\r\nheroic deed in all ages; but the selling of clothes, old or new, has\r\nnever taken any color of magnanimity. Yet one does not see why feeding\r\nthe hungry and clothing the naked should ever become base businesses\r\neven when engaged in on a large scale. If one could contrive to attach\r\nthe notion of conquest to _them_ anyhow? so that, supposing there were\r\nanywhere an obstinate race, who refused to be comforted, one might\r\ntake some pride in giving them compulsory comfort, and, as it were,\r\n\"occupying a country\" with one's gifts, instead of one's armies? If\r\none could only consider it as much a victory to get a barren field\r\nsown as to get an eared field stripped; and contend who should build\r\nvillages, instead of who should \"carry\" them? Are not all forms of\r\nheroism conceivable in doing these serviceable deeds? You doubt who\r\nis strongest? It might be ascertained by push of spade as well as\r\npush of sword. Who is wisest? There are witty things to be thought of\r\nin planning other business than campaigns. Who is bravest? There are\r\nalways the elements to fight with, stronger than men; and nearly as\r\nmerciless.\r\n\r\nAnd, then, observe farther, this true power, the power of saving,\r\ndepends neither on multitude of men, nor on extent of territory. We\r\nare continually assuming that nations become strong according to their\r\nnumbers. They indeed become so, if those numbers can be made of one\r\nmind. But how are you sure you can stay them in one mind, and keep them\r\nfrom having north and south minds? Grant them unanimous, how know you\r\nthey will be unanimous in right? If they are unanimous in wrong, the\r\nmore they are, essentially the weaker they are. Or, suppose that they\r\ncan neither be of one mind, nor of two minds, but can only be of _no_\r\nmind? Suppose they are a mere helpless mob, tottering into precipitant\r\ncatastrophe, like a wagon-load of stones when the wheel comes off?\r\nDangerous enough for their neighbors certainly, but not \"powerful.\"\r\n\r\nNeither does strength depend on extent of territory, any more than\r\nupon number of population. Take up your masses, put the cluster of\r\nthe British Isles beside the mass of South America, and then consider\r\nwhether any race of men need consider how much ground they stand upon.\r\nThe strength is in the men, and in their unity and virtue, not in\r\ntheir standing-room. A little group of wise hearts is better than a\r\nwilderness full of fools; and only that nation gains true territory\r\nwhich gains itself.\r\n\r\n                     I am, Sir, your faithful servant,\r\n                                                       J.

It is headed, \"The Difficulties of Neutrality,\"\r\ndated Bonn, and anticipates part of what I was going to say; for the\r\nrest, the lessons of the war, as I read them, are briefly these.\r\n\r\nAs to its cause, neither the French nation nor their Emperor brought on\r\nwar by any present will of their own. Neither of them were capable of a\r\nwill at all--far less of executing it. The nation has since declared,\r\nby submission, with acclaim, to a change of Government which for the\r\ntime renders all political treaty with it practically impossible,\r\nthat during the last twenty years it has been deceived or subdued\r\ninto obedience to a man for whom it had no respect, and who had no\r\nhereditary claim to the throne. What \"will\" or responsibility of action\r\ncan be expected from a nation which confesses this of itself? On the\r\nother hand, the Emperor, be his motives never so selfish, could only\r\nhave hoped to save his dynasty by compliance with the passions of a\r\npopulace which he knew would overthrow it in the first hour of their\r\nmortification. It is in these vain passions and the falsehoods on\r\nwhich they have fed that we must look for the deep roots of all this\r\nmisery. Since the days of the First Empire, no cottage in France has\r\nbeen without its Napoleonic picture and legend, fostering one and the\r\nsame faith in the heart of every peasant boy, that there is no glory\r\nbut in battle; and since the founding of the Second Empire no street\r\nof any city has risen into its foolish magnificence without collateral\r\nproclamation that there was no pleasure but in vice.\r\n\r\nThen, secondly, for the actual question of the war: it is a simple\r\nand testing struggle between pure Republicanism on the one side,\r\nexpressed in the most exquisite, finished, and exemplary anarchy, yet\r\nachieved under--earth--and one of the truest Monarchies and schools of\r\nhonor and obedience yet organized under heaven. And the secret of its\r\nstrength, we have to note, is essentially pacific; for all the wars\r\nof the Great Friedrich would have passed away resultless--as great\r\nwars usually do--had it not been for this pregnant fact at the end\r\nof them: \"All his artillery horses are parted into plough-teams, and\r\ngiven to those who otherwise can get none\" (Carlyle, vol. vi., first\r\nedition, p. 350)--that 21st book on the repair of Prussia being of\r\nextant literature the most important piece for us to read and digest\r\nin these days of \"raising the poor without gifts\"--never asking who\r\nfirst let them fall--and of turning workmen out of dockyards, without\r\nany consciousness that, of all the stores in the yard, the men were\r\nexactly the most precious. You expressed, Sir, in your article on the\r\nloss of the Captain,[28] a feeling common, I suppose, for once, to\r\nall of us, that the principal loss was not the iron of the ship, but\r\nthe five hundred men in her. Perhaps, had she been of gold instead of\r\niron plate, public mourning might have inclined itself to the side\r\nof the metal. But how if the whole British public should be itself\r\nat this instant afloat in a captain-less Captain, built of somewhat\r\ndirty yet substantial gold, and in extremest peril of turning bottom\r\nupwards? Which will be the end, indeed, unless the said public quickly\r\nperceive that their hope must be, not in docks nor ships, but in men.\r\nThey, and they only, are our guarantee for territory. Prussia herself\r\nseems as simple as the rest of us in her talk of \"guarantees.\" Alsace\r\nand Lorraine, if dishonestly come by, may be honestly retaken; but if\r\nfor \"guarantee,\" why these only? Why not Burgundy and Anjou--Auvergne\r\nand the Limousin? Let France lose what she may, if she can but find a\r\nCharles and Roland among her children, she will recover her empire,\r\nthough she had been beaten back to the Brêche; and if she find them\r\nnot, Germany has all the guarantee she needs in her own name, and in\r\nher own right hand.\r\n\r\nLet her look to it, now, that her fame be not sullied. She is pressing\r\nher victory too far--dangerously far, as uselessly. The Nemesis\r\nof battle may indeed be near her; greater glory she cannot win by\r\nthe taking of Paris, nor the overrunning of provinces--she only\r\nprolongs suffering, redoubles death, extends loss, incalculable and\r\nirremediable. But let her now give unconditional armistice, and offer\r\nterms that France can accept with honor, and she will bear such rank\r\namong the nations as never yet shone on Christian history.\r\n\r\nFor us, we ought to help France now, if we ever did anything, but\r\nof course there remains for us only neutrality--selling of coke,\r\nand silence (if we have grace enough left to keep it). I have only\r\nbroken mine to say that I am ashamed to speak as being one of a nation\r\nregardless of its honor alike in trade and policy; poor, yet not\r\ncareful to keep even the treasure of probity--and rich, without being\r\nable to afford itself the luxury of courage.\r\n\r\n                     I am, Sir, your faithful servant,\r\n                                                       J.

S. C. rests his \"incontestable\" conclusion that \"battles are less\r\nsanguinary than they were,\" are incomplete in this vital respect,\r\nthat they furnish us only with the proportion, and not with the total\r\nnumber, of combatants slain. A barricade fight between a mob of rioters\r\na thousand strong, and a battery of artillery, in which fifty reformers\r\nget shot, is not \"less sanguinary\" than a street quarrel between three\r\ntopers, of whom one gets knocked on the head with a pewter pot: though\r\nno more than the twentieth part of the forces on one side fall in the\r\nfirst case, and a third of the total forces engaged, in the second. Nor\r\ncould it be proved by the exhibition of these proportions of loss, that\r\nthe substitution of explosive shells, as offensive weapons, for pewter\r\npots, rendered wounds less painful, or war more humane.\r\n\r\nNow, the practical difference between ancient and modern war, as\r\ncarried on by civilized nations, is, broadly, of this kind. Formerly,\r\nthe persons who had quarrelled settled their differences by the\r\nstrength of their own arms, at the head of their retainers, with\r\ncomparatively inexpensive weapons such as they could conveniently\r\nwield; weapons which they had paid for out of their own pockets, and\r\nwith which they struck only the people they meant to strike: while,\r\nnowadays, persons who quarrel fight at a distance, with mechanical\r\napparatus, for the manufacture of which they have taxed the public,\r\nand which will kill anybody who happens to be in the way; gathering\r\nat the same time, to put into the way of them, as large a quantity of\r\nsenseless and innocent mob as can be beguiled, or compelled, to the\r\nslaughter. So that, in the words of your contributor, \"Modern armies\r\nare not now small fractions of the population whence they are drawn;\r\nthey represent--in fact are--whole nations in arms.\" I have only to\r\ncorrect this somewhat vague and rhetorical statement by pointing out\r\nthat the persons in arms, led out for mutual destruction, are by no\r\nmeans \"the whole nation\" on either side, but only the individuals of it\r\nwho are able-bodied, honest, and brave, selected to be shot, from among\r\nits invalids, rogues, and cowards.\r\n\r\nThe deficiencies in your contributor's evidence as to the totality of\r\nloss do not, however, invalidate his conclusion that, out of given\r\nnumbers engaged, the mitrailleuse kills fewer than the musket.[31]\r\nIt is, nevertheless, a very startling conclusion, and one not to be\r\naccepted without closer examination of the statistics on which it is\r\nbased. I will, therefore, tabulate them in a simpler form, which the\r\neye can catch easily, omitting only one or two instances which add\r\nnothing to the force of the evidence.\r\n\r\nIn the six under-named battles of bygone times, there fell, according\r\nto your contributor's estimate, out of the total combatants--\r\n\r\n  At Austerlitz      ⅐\r\n\r\n  Jena               ⅙\r\n\r\n  Waterloo           ⅕\r\n\r\n  Marengo            ¼\r\n\r\n  Salamanca          ⅓\r\n\r\n  Eylau              1/2½\r\n\r\nwhile in the under-named five recent battles the proportion of loss was--\r\n\r\n  At Königgratz      1/15\r\n\r\n  Gravelotte         1/12\r\n\r\n  Solferino          1/11\r\n\r\n  Worth              1/11\r\n\r\n  Sedan              1/10\r\n\r\nNow, there is a very important difference in the character of the\r\nbattles named in these two lists. Every one of the first six was\r\ndecisive, and both sides knew that it must be so when the engagement\r\nbegan, and did their best to win. But Königgratz was only decisive\r\nby sudden and appalling demonstration of the power of a new weapon.\r\nSolferino was only half fought, and not followed up because the French\r\nEmperor had exhausted his _corps d'élite_ at Magenta, and could not\r\n(or, at least, so it is reported) depend on his troops of the line.\r\nWorth was an experiment; Sedan a discouraged ruin; Gravelotte was, I\r\nbelieve, well contested, but I do not know on what extent of the line,\r\nand we have no real evidence as to the power of modern mechanics for\r\ndeath, until the proportions are calculated, not from the numbers\r\nengaged, but from those under fire for equal times. Now, in all the\r\nupper list of battles, probably every man of both armies was under\r\nfire, and some of the regiments under fire for half the day; while\r\nin the lower list of battles, only fragments of the line were hotly\r\nengaged, and the dispute on any point reaching its intensity would be\r\nended in half an hour.\r\n\r\nThat the close of contest is so rapid may indeed be one of the\r\nconditions of improvement in our military system alleged by your\r\ncorrespondent; and the statistics he has brought forward do indeed\r\nclearly prove one of two things--either that modern weapons do not\r\nkill, or that modern soldiers do not fight as effectually as in\r\nold times. I do not know if this is thought a desirable change in\r\nmilitary circles; but I, as a poor civilian, beg to express my strong\r\nobjection to being taxed six times over what I used to be, either for\r\nthe equipment of soldiers who rarely fight, or the manufacture of\r\nweapons which rarely kill. It may be perfectly true that our last\r\ncruise on the Baltic was \"less sanguinary\" than that which concluded\r\nin Copenhagen. But we shook hands with the Danes after fighting\r\nthem, and the differences between us were ended: while our expensive\r\ncontemplation of the defences of Cronstadt leaves us still in daily\r\ndread of an inspection by the Russian of those of Calcutta.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the ingenuity of our inventors is far from being\r\nexhausted, and that in a few years more we may be able to destroy a\r\nregiment round a corner and bombard a fleet over the horizon; but I\r\nbelieve the effective result of these crowning scientific successes\r\nwill only be to confirm the at present partial impression on the minds\r\nof military and naval officers, that their duty is rather to take\r\ncare of their weapons than to use them. \"England will expect\" of her\r\ngenerals and admirals to maintain a dignified moral position as far as\r\npossible out of the enemy's sight: and in a perfectly scientific era\r\nof seamanship we shall see two adverse fleets affected by a constant\r\nlaw of mutual repulsion at distances of two or three hundred miles;\r\nwhile in either squadron, an occasional collision between the leading\r\nships, or inexplicable foundering of the last improved ones, will make\r\nthese prudential manœuvres on the whole as destructive of the force,\r\nand about ten times more costly to the pocket, of the nation, than the\r\nancient, and, perhaps, more honorable tactics of poorly-armed pugnacity.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one point touched upon in P. S. C.'s letter, to\r\nme the most interesting of all, with respect to which the data for\r\naccurate comparison of our former and present systems are especially\r\ndesirable, though it never seems to have occurred to your correspondent\r\nto collect them--the estimates, namely, of the relative destruction of\r\ncivil property.\r\n\r\nOf wilful destruction, I most thankfully acknowledge the cessation\r\nin Christian warfare; and in the great change between the day of\r\nthe sack of Magdeburg and that of the march into Paris, recognize\r\na true sign of the approach of the reign of national peace. But of\r\ninevitable destruction--of loss inflicted on the peasant by the merely\r\nimperative requirements and operations of contending armies--it\r\nwill materially hasten the advent of such peace, if we ascertain the\r\nincreasing pressure during our nominally mollified and merciful war.\r\nThe agricultural losses sustained by France in one year are estimated\r\nby your correspondent at one hundred and seventy millions of pounds.\r\nLet him add to this sum the agricultural loss necessitated in the\r\nsame year throughout Germany, through the withdrawal of capital from\r\nproductive industry, for the maintenance of her armies; and of labor\r\nfrom it by their composition; and, for third item, add the total\r\ncost of weapons, horses, and ammunition on both sides; and let him\r\nthen inform us whether the cost, thus summed, of a year's actual war\r\nbetween two European States, is supposed by military authorities to\r\nbe fairly representative of that which the settlement of political\r\ndispute between any two such Powers, with modern instruments of battle,\r\nwill on an average, in future, involve. If so, I will only venture\r\nfurther to suggest that the nations minded thus to try their quarrel\r\nshould at least raise the stakes for their match before they make\r\nthe ring, instead of drawing bills for them upon futurity. For that\r\nthe money-lenders whose pockets are filled, while everybody else's\r\nare emptied, by recent military finance, should occultly exercise\r\nirresistible influence, not only on the development of our--according\r\nto your contributor--daily more harmless armaments, but also on the\r\ndeliberation of Cabinets, and passions of the populace, is inevitable\r\nunder present circumstances; and the exercise of such influence,\r\nhowever advantageous to contractors and projectors, can scarcely be\r\nheld consistent either with the honor of a Senate or the safety of a\r\nState.\r\n\r\n        I am, Sir,\r\n  Your faithful servant,\r\n                              J. RUSKIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I wish I could get a broad approximate estimate of the\r\nexpenditure in money, and loss of men by France and Prussia in the\r\nrespective years of Jena and Sedan, and by France and Austria in the\r\nrespective years of Arcola and Solferino.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[29] \"Remarks on Modern Warfare.\" By a Military Officer.

Suppose, for instance, that\r\nI hold stock to the value of £500 a year;--if I live on a hundred a\r\nyear, and lay by four hundred, I (for the time) keep down the prices of\r\nall goods to the distributed amount of £400 a year, or, in other words,\r\nneutralize the effect on the market of 400 pounds in gold imported\r\nannually from Australia. If, instead of laying by this sum in paper, I\r\nchoose to throw it into bullion (whether gold-plate or coin does not\r\nmatter), I not only keep down the price of goods, but raise the price\r\nof gold as a commodity, and neutralize 800 pounds' worth of imported\r\ngold. But if I annually spend my entire 500 (unproductively) I annually\r\nraise the price of goods by that amount, and neutralize a correspondent\r\ndiminution in the supply of gold. If I spend my 500 productively,\r\nthat is to say, so as to produce as much as, or more than I consume, I\r\neither leave the market as I find it, or by the excess of production\r\nincrease the value of gold.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, whatever I lay by will, as it is ultimately spent by my\r\nsuccessors, productively or unproductively, in that degree (_cœteris\r\nparibus_) increase or lower the value of gold. These agencies of daily\r\neconomy have so much more power over the market than the supply from\r\nthe mine that no statistics of which we are yet in possession are (at\r\nleast in their existing form) sufficient to prove the dependence of\r\nany given phenomena of the market on the rate of metallic supply. The\r\ndestruction of property in the American war and our European amusements\r\nin the manufacture of monster guns and steel \"backings\" lower the\r\nvalue of money far more surely and fatally than an increased supply\r\nof bullion, for the latter may very possibly excite parallel force of\r\nproductive industry.\r\n\r\nBut the lowered value of money is often (and this is a very curious\r\ncase of economical back current) indicated, not so much by a rise in\r\nthe price of goods, as by a fall in that of labor. The household lives\r\nas comfortably as it did on a hundred a year, but the master has to\r\nwork half as hard again to get it. This increase of toil is to an\r\nactive nation often a kind of play; men go into it as into a violent\r\ngame; fathers of families die quicker, and the gates of orphan asylums\r\nare choked with applicants; distress and crime spread and fester\r\nthrough a thousand silent channels; but there is no commercial or\r\nelementary convulsion; no chasm opens into the abyss through the London\r\nclay; no gilded victim is asked of the Guards; the Stock-Exchange falls\r\ninto no hysterics; and the old lady of Threadneedle Street does not so\r\nmuch as ask for \"My fan, Peter.\"\r\n\r\n                     I am, Sir, your obedient servant,\r\n                                                       J. RUSKIN.\r\n\r\n  CHAMOUNIX, _Oct._ 2.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[32] See one of the leading articles in _The Times_ of Sept. 23, 1863,\r\nupon the then panic as to the depreciation of gold, excited by the\r\nconsiderable fresh discoveries of the precious metal in California and\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From \"The Daily Telegraph,\" October 28, 1864.]\r\n\r\n_THE LAW OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND._\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of \"The Daily Telegraph.\"_\r\n\r\nSIR: In your valuable article of to-day on the strike of the colliers,\r\nwhile you lay down the true and just law[33] respecting all such\r\ncombinations, you take your stand, in the outset, on a maxim of\r\npolitical economy, which, however trite, stands yet--if I am not\r\ndeceived--in need of much examination and qualification. \"Labor,\" you\r\nsay, like every other vendible commodity, \"depends for its value on\r\nthe relation of supply to demand.\" But, Sir, might it not be asked by\r\nany simple and practical person, who had heard this assertion for the\r\nfirst time--as I hope all practical persons will some day hear it for\r\nthe last time--\"Yes; but what does demand depend upon, and what does\r\nsupply depend upon?\" If, for instance, all death-beds came to resemble\r\nthat so forcibly depicted in your next following article, and, in\r\nconsequence, the demand for gin were unlimitedly increased towards the\r\nclose of human life,[34] would this demand necessitate, or indicate,\r\na relative increase in the \"value\" of gin as a necessary article of\r\nnational wealth, and liquid foundation of national prosperity? Or might\r\nwe not advisably make some steady and generally understood distinction\r\nbetween the terms \"value\" and \"price,\" and determine at once whether\r\nthere be, or be not, such a thing as intrinsic \"value\" or goodness in\r\nsome things, and as intrinsic un-value or badness in other things; and\r\nas value extrinsic, or according to use, in all things? and whether a\r\ndemand for intrinsically good things, and a corresponding knowledge\r\nof their use, be not conditions likely, on the whole, to tend towards\r\nnational wealth? and whether a demand for intrinsically bad things,\r\nand relative experience in their use, be not conditions likely to lead\r\nto quite the reverse of national wealth, in exact proportion to the\r\nfacility of the supply of the said bad things? I should be entirely\r\ngrateful to you, Sir, or to any of your correspondents, if you or they\r\nwould answer these short questions clearly for me.\r\n\r\n                             I am, Sir, yours, etc.,\r\n                                                    J. RUSKIN.[35]\r\n\r\n  DENMARK HILL, _Oct._ 26.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[33] The strike was amongst the South Staffordshire colliers: the law\r\nlaid down in the article that of free trade.\r\n\r\n[34] Upon the then recent and miserable death of an Irish gentleman,\r\nwho had been an habitual hard-drinker.\r\n\r\n[35] To this letter an answer (_Daily Telegraph_, October 29) was\r\nattempted by \"Economist,\" writing from \"Lloyds, Oct. 28,\" stating that\r\n\"Value in political economy means exchangeable value, not intrinsic\r\nvalue.\" The rest of his letter is given in Mr. Ruskin's reply to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From \"The Daily Telegraph,\" October 31, 1864.]\r\n\r\n_THE LAW OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND._\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of \"The Daily Telegraph.\"_\r\n\r\nSIR: I am grateful to your correspondent \"Economist\" for trying his\r\nhand on me, and will be a docile pupil; but I hope his hand is not\r\nquite untried hitherto, for it would waste your space, and my time,\r\nand your readers' patience, if he taught me what I had afterwards to\r\nunlearn. But I think none of these will be wasted if he answers my\r\nquestions clearly; there are, I am sure, many innocent persons who,\r\nlike myself, will be glad of the information.\r\n\r\n1. He tells me, then, in the outset, \"The intrinsic value of\r\ncommodities is a question outside political economy.\"\r\n\r\nIs that an axiom for all political economists? and may I put it down\r\nfor future reference? I particularly wish to be assured of this.\r\n\r\n2. Assuming, for the present, that I may so set it down, and that\r\nexchangeable value is the only subject of politico-economical inquiry,\r\nI proceed to my informant's following statement:\r\n\r\n\"The\" (question) \"of intrinsic value belongs to the domain of\r\nphilosophy, morals, or statecraft. The intrinsic value of anything\r\ndepends on its qualities; the exchangeable value depends on how much\r\nthere is of it, and how much people want it.\"\r\n\r\n(This \"want\" of it never, of course, in anywise depending on its\r\nqualities.)\r\n\r\nΜανθανω. Accordingly, in that ancient and rashly-speculative adage,\r\n\"Venture a sprat to catch a herring,\" it is only assumed that people\r\nwill always want herrings rather than sprats, and that there will\r\nalways be fewer of them. No reference is involved, according to\r\neconomists, to the relative sizes of a sprat and herring.\r\n\r\nFarther: Were a fashionable doctor to write an essay on sprats,\r\nand increase their display at West-end tables to that extent that\r\nunseasonable sprats became worth a guinea a head, while herrings\r\nremained at the old nursery rate of one and a half for three-halfpence,\r\nwould my \"recognition\" of the value of sprats in paying a guinea for\r\none enable me to dine off it better than I should off that mysterious\r\neleven-penny worth of herring? Or to take a more elevated instance.\r\nThere is now on my room wall a water-color drawing, which was once\r\nbought for £30, and for which any dealer would to-morrow give me £300.\r\nThe drawing is intrinsically worth about one-tenth of what it was when\r\nbought for £30, the sky having faded out of it, and many colors having\r\nchanged elsewhere. But men's minds have changed like the colors, and\r\nLord A. or Sir John B. are now ready to give me £300 instead of £30 for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nNow, I want to know what it matters to \"Economist,\" or to the\r\nEconomical Society he (as I understand) represents, or to the British\r\nnation generally, whether Lord A. has the bit of colored paper and I\r\nthe £300, or Lord A. the £300 and I the bit of paper. The pounds are\r\nthere, and the paper is there: what does it nationally matter which of\r\nus have which?\r\n\r\nFarther: What does it nationally matter whether Lord A. gives me £30\r\nor £300 on the exchange? (Mind, I do not say it does not matter--I\r\nonly want \"Economist\" to tell me if it does, and how it does.) In one\r\ncase my lord has £270 more to spend; in the other I have. What does it\r\nsignify which of us has?\r\n\r\nFarther: To us, the exchangers, of what use is \"Economist's\"\r\ninformation that the rate of exchange depends on the \"demand and\r\nsupply\" of colored paper and pounds? No ghost need come from the grave\r\nto tell us that. But if any economical ghost would tell my lord how to\r\nget more pounds, or me how to get more drawings, it might be to the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nBut yet farther, passing from specialties to generals:\r\n\r\nLet the entire property of the nation be enumerated in the several\r\narticles of which it consists--_a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, etc.; we will say\r\nonly three, for convenience sake. Then all the national property\r\nconsists of _a_ + _b_ + _c_.\r\n\r\nI ask, first, what _a_ is worth.\r\n\r\n\"Economist\" answers (suppose) 2 _b_.\r\n\r\nI ask, next, what _b_ is worth.\r\n\r\n\"Economist\" answers (suppose) 3 _c_.\r\n\r\nI ask, next, what _c_ is worth.\r\n\r\n\"Economist\" answers--_a/b_.\r\n\r\nMany thanks. That is certainly Cocker's view of it.\r\n\r\nI ask, finally, What is it _all_ worth?\r\n\r\n\"Economist\" answers, 1⅔ _a_, or 3⅓ _b_, or 10 _c_.\r\n\r\nThanks again. But now, intrinsic value not being in \"Economist's\"\r\ndomain, but--if I chance to be a philosopher--in mine, I may any day\r\ndiscover any given intrinsic value to belong to any one of these\r\narticles.\r\n\r\nSuppose I find, for instance, the value of _c_ to be intrinsically\r\nzero, then the entire national property = 10_c_ = intrinsically 0.\r\n\r\nShall I be justified in this conclusion?\r\n\r\n3. In relation to the question of strikes, the difficulty, you told\r\nme yourself, Mr. Editor[36] (and doubtless \"Economist\" will tell me\r\nalso), depends simply on supply and demand: that is to say, on an\r\nunder-supply of wages and an over-supply of laborers. Profoundest\r\nthanks again; but I, poor blundering, thick-headed collier, feel\r\ndisposed further to ask, \"On what do this underness and overness of\r\nsupply depend?\" Have they any remote connection with marriage, or with\r\nimprovidence, or with avarice, or with accumulativeness, or any other\r\nhuman weaknesses out of the ken of political economy? And, whatever\r\nthey arise from, how are they to be dealt with? It appears to me, poor\r\nsimple collier, that the shortest way of dealing with this \"darned\"\r\nsupply of laborers will be by knocking some of them down, or otherwise\r\ndisabling them for the present. Why is this mode of regulating the\r\nsupply interdicted to me? and what have Economists to do with the\r\nmorality of any proceeding whatever? and, in the name of economy\r\ngenerally, what else can I do?[37]\r\n\r\n                             I am, Sir, yours, etc.,\r\n                                                       J.

A\r\nreply to this letter was however attempted by \"John Plummer,\" writing\r\nfrom Kettering, and dealing with the over-supply of laborers and\r\nunder-supply of wages, and Mr. Ruskin's possible views on the matter.\r\nThe next letter ended the correspondence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From \"The Daily Telegraph,\" November 8, 1864.]\r\n\r\n_THE LAW OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND._\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of \"The Daily Telegraph.\"_\r\n\r\nSIR: Having, unfortunately, occupation enough in my own business for\r\nall hours of the day, I cannot undertake to reply to the general\r\ncorrespondence which might, in large supply to my limited demand,\r\npropose itself in your columns. If my first respondent, \"Economist,\" or\r\nany other person learned in his science, will give me direct answers\r\nto the direct questions asked in my Monday's letter, I may, with your\r\npermission, follow the points at issue farther; if not, I will trouble\r\nyou no more. Your correspondent of to-day, Mr. Plummer, may ascertain\r\nwhether I confuse the terms \"value\" and \"price\" by reference to the\r\nbottom of the second column in page 787 of \"Fraser's Magazine\" for\r\nJune, 1862.

RUSKIN AND PROFESSOR HODGSON._\r\n\r\n  CORPUS CHRISTI COLLEGE, OXFORD,\r\n             _Nov. 8th_, 1873.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of \"The Scotsman.\"_\r\n\r\nSIR: In your impression of the 6th inst. I find a report of a lecture\r\ndelivered by Professor Hodgson in the University of Edinburgh on the\r\nsubject of \"Supply and Demand,\" in which the Professor speaks of my\r\n\"denunciations\" of the principles he had expounded. Permit me, in\r\na matter respecting which accuracy is of more importance to others\r\nthan to myself, to correct the Professor's expression. I have never\r\n\"denounced\" the principles expounded by the Professor. I have simply\r\nstated that no such principles exist; that no \"law of supply and\r\ndemand,\" as expounded by Professor Hodgson and modern economists, ever\r\ndid or can exist.\r\n\r\nProfessor Hodgson, as reported in your columns, states that \"demand\r\nregulates supply.\" He does not appear to entertain the incomparably\r\nmore important economical question, \"What regulates demand?\" But\r\nwithout pressing upon him that first question of all, I am content\r\nabsolutely to contradict and to challenge him before the University of\r\nEdinburgh to maintain his statement that \"demand regulates supply,\" and\r\ntogether with it (if he has ventured to advance it) the correlative\r\nproposition, \"supply regulates demand.\"\r\n\r\nA. Demand does not regulate supply.\r\n\r\nFor instance--there is at this moment a larger demand for champagne\r\nwine in England and Scotland than there was ten years ago; and a much\r\nmore limited supply of champagne wine.\r\n\r\nB. Supply does not regulate demand.\r\n\r\nFor instance--I can name many districts in Scotland where the supply of\r\npure water is larger than in other namable localities, but where the\r\ninhabitants drink less water and more whiskey than in other namable\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\nI do not therefore denounce the so-called law of supply and demand,\r\nbut I absolutely deny the existence of such law; and I do in the very\r\nstrongest terms denounce the assertion of the existence of such a law\r\nbefore the University of Edinburgh as disgraceful both to its assertor\r\nand to the University, unless immediate steps be taken to define, in\r\nscientific terms, the limitations under which such statement is to be\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\n  I am, etc.,\r\n                    JOHN RUSKIN.[39]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[39] To this letter Professor Hodgson replied by one printed in the\r\n_Scotsman_ of November 14.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From \"The Scotsman,\" November 18, 1873]\r\n\r\n_MR. RUSKIN AND PROFESSOR HODGSON._\r\n\r\n                              OXFORD, _November_ 15, 1873.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of \"The Scotsman.\"_\r\n\r\nSIR: For Professor Hodgson's \"undue encroachments on your space and his\r\nown time,\" I leave you to answer to your readers, and the Professor to\r\nconsole his class. To his criticisms on my language and temper I bow,\r\ntheir defence being irrelevant to the matter in hand. Of his harmless\r\nconfusion of the word \"correlative\" with the word \"consequent\" I take\r\nno notice; and his promise of a sifting examination of my economic\r\nteaching I anticipate with grateful awe.[40]\r\n\r\nBut there is one sentence in his letter of real significance, and to\r\nthat alone I reply. The Professor ventured (he says) to suggest that\r\npossibly I with others \"believe that economists confused existing\r\ndemand with wise and beneficial demand, and existing supply with wise\r\nand beneficial supply.\"\r\n\r\nI do believe this. I have written all my books on political economy in\r\nsuch belief. And the entire gist of them is the assertion that a real\r\nlaw of relation holds between the non-existent wise demand and the\r\nnon-existent beneficial supply, but that no real law of relation holds\r\nbetween the existent foolish demand and the existent mischievous supply.\r\n\r\nThat is to say (to follow Professor Hodgson with greater accuracy into\r\nhis lunar illustrations), if you ask for the moon, it does not follow\r\nthat you will get it; nor is your satisfaction more secure if you ask\r\nfor sixpence from a Poor-Law guardian; but if you limit your demand to\r\nan honest penny, and endeavor to turn it by honest work, the divine law\r\nof supply will, in the plurality of cases, answer that rational and\r\ntherefore divine demand.\r\n\r\nNow, Professor Hodgson's statement, as reported in your columns, was\r\nthat \"demand regulates supply.\" If his assertion, in his lecture, was\r\nthe qualified one, or that \"wise demand regulates beneficial supply,\"\r\nyour reporter is much to be blamed, the Professor's class profoundly\r\nto be congratulated, and this correspondence is at an end; while I\r\nlook forward with deepest interest to the necessary elucidations by\r\nthe Professor of the nature of wisdom and benefit; neither of these\r\nideas having been yet familiar ones in common economical treatises.\r\nBut I wrote under the impression that the Professor dealt hitherto,\r\nas it has been the boast of economists to deal, with things existent,\r\nand not theoretical (and assuredly the practical men of this country\r\nexpect their children to be instructed by him in the laws which\r\ngovern existing things); and it is therefore only in the name of\r\nyour practical readers that I challenged him, and to-day repeat my\r\nchallenge, in terms from which I trust he will not again attempt\r\nto escape by circumambient criticism of my works,[41] to define,\r\nin scientific terms, the limits under which his general statement\r\nthat \"supply regulates demand\" is to be understood. That is to say,\r\nwhether he, as Professor of Political Economy, is about to explain\r\nthe relations (A) of rational and satiable demand with beneficial and\r\nbenevolently-directly supply; or (B) of irrational and insatiable\r\ndemand with mischievous and malevolently-directed supply; or (C) of a\r\ndemand of which he cannot explain the character with a supply of which\r\nhe cannot predict the consequence?\r\n\r\n  I am, etc.,\r\n                         J. RUSKIN.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[40] \"I hereby promise Mr. Ruskin that ere very many months are over he\r\nshall have in print a sifting examination of his economic teaching.\" I\r\ndo not find, however, that Professor Hodgson fulfilled his promise.\r\n\r\n[41] Professor Hodgson's letter had quoted, with criticism, several\r\npassages from \"Fors Clavigera,\" \"Munera Pulveris,\" and \"Time and Tide.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From \"The Pall Mall Gazette,\" April 18, 1865.]\r\n\r\n_STRIKES v. ARBITRATION._\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of \"The Pall Mall Gazette.\"_\r\n\r\nSIR: I read your _Gazette_ so attentively that I am always falling into\r\narrears, and have only to-day arrived at your last week's articles on\r\nstrikes, arbitration, etc., which afford me the greatest satisfaction,\r\nbut nevertheless embarrass me somewhat. Will you permit me to ask for a\r\nword or two of further elucidation?\r\n\r\nI am an entirely selfish person, and having the means of indulging\r\nmyself (in moderation), should, I believe, have led a comfortable life,\r\nhad it not been for occasional fits and twinges of conscience, to which\r\nI inherit some family predisposition, and from which I suffer great\r\nuneasiness in cloudy weather. Articles like yours of Wednesday,[42] on\r\nthe proper attention to one's own interests, are very comforting and\r\nhelpful to me; but, as I said, there are yet some points in them I do\r\nnot understand.\r\n\r\nOf course it is right to arrange all one's business with reference\r\nto one's own interest; but what will the practical difference\r\nbe ultimately between such arrangement and the old and simple\r\nconscientious one? In those bygone days, I remember, one endeavored,\r\nwith such rough estimate as could be quickly made, to give one's Roland\r\nfor one's Oliver; if a man did you a service, you tried in return\r\nto do as much for him; if he broke your head, you broke his, shook\r\nhands, and were both the better for it. Contrariwise, on this modern\r\nprinciple of self-interest, I understand very well that if a man does\r\nme a service, I am always to do the least I can in return for it; but\r\nI don't see how I am always to get more out of him than he gets out of\r\nme. I dislike any references to abstract justice as much as you do, but\r\nI cannot see my way to keeping this injustice always in my own favor;\r\nand if I cannot, it seems to me the matter may as well be settled at\r\nfirst, as it must come to be settled at last, in that disagreeably just\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThus, for instance, in producing a piece of iron for the market, one\r\nman digs it, another smelts it, another puddles it, and I sell it. We\r\nget so much between us four; and I suppose your conscientious people\r\nwould say that the division of the pay should have some reference to\r\nthe hardness of the work, and the time spent in it. It is true that by\r\nencouraging the diggers and puddlers to spend all they get in drink,\r\nand by turning them off as soon as I hear they are laying by money,\r\nit may yet be possible to get them for some time to take less than I\r\nsuppose they should have; but I cannot hide from myself that the men\r\nare beginning to understand the game a little themselves; and if they\r\nshould, with the help of those confounded--(I beg pardon! I forgot that\r\none does not print such expressions in Pall Mall)--education-mongers,\r\nlearn to be men, and to look after their own business as I do mine,\r\nwhat am I to do? Even at present I don't feel easy in telling them that\r\nI ought to have more money than they because I know better how to spend\r\nit, for even this involves a distant reference to notions of propriety\r\nand principle which I would gladly avoid. Will you kindly tell me what\r\nis best to be done (or said)?\r\n\r\n                      I am, Sir, your obliged servant,\r\n                                                     JOHN RUSKIN.\r\n\r\n  _Easter Monday_, 1865.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[42] The articles alluded to were, one upon \"Strikes and Arbitration\r\nCourts,\" in the _Gazette_ of Wednesday, the 12th, and the one on \"The\r\n_Times_ on Trade Arbitration,\" in the _Gazette_ of Thursday, the 13th.\r\nThe former dealt with the proposal to decide questions raised by\r\nstrikes by reference to courts of arbitration. Amongst the sentences\r\ncontained in it, and alluded to by Mr. Ruskin, were the following:\r\n\"Phrases about the 'principles of right and justice' are always\r\nsuspicious and generally fallacious.\" \"The rate of wages is determined\r\nexclusively by self-interest.\" \"There is no such thing as a 'fair' rate\r\nof wages or a 'just' rate of wages.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From \"The Pall Mall Gazette,\" April 21, 1865.]\r\n\r\n_WORK AND WAGES._\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of \"The Pall Mall Gazette.\"_\r\n\r\nSIR: I am not usually unready for controversy, but I dislike it in\r\nspring, as I do the east wind (_pace_ Mr. Kingsley), and I both regret\r\nhaving given occasion to the only dull leader which has yet[43]\r\nappeared in the _Pall Mall Gazette_, and the necessity I am involved in\r\nof dissecting the same, instead of a violet, on which I was about this\r\nmorning to begin operations.\r\n\r\nBut I see, Sir, that you mean fairly, and that you have careful\r\nthinkers and writers on your staff. And I will accept your battle, if\r\nyou will fight with short swords, which is clearly your interest, for\r\nsuch another article would sink the _Gazette_; and mine, for I have no\r\ntime to answer speculations on what you writers suppose my opinions may\r\nbe, \"if we understand\" them.\r\n\r\nYou shall understand them utterly, as I already understand yours. I\r\nwill not call yours \"fallacies\" _à priori_; you shall not call mine so.\r\nI will not tell you of your \"unconscious\" meanings; you shall not tell\r\nme of mine.[44] But I will ask you the plainest questions, and make\r\nto you the plainest answers my English will admit of, on one point at\r\na time only, expecting you also to ask or answer as briefly, without\r\ndivergence or deprecation. And twenty lines will always contain all I\r\nwould say, at any intervals of time you choose.\r\n\r\nFor example: I said I must \"dissect\" your leader, meaning that I\r\nshould have to take a piece of it, as I would of my flower, and deal\r\nwith that first; then with its sequences.\r\n\r\nI take this sentence then: \"He (Mr. R.) seems to think that apart from\r\nthe question of the powers of the parties, there is some such thing\r\nas a just rate of wages. He seems to be under the impression that the\r\nwages ought to be proportioned, not to the supply and demand of labor\r\nand capital, but 'to the hardship of the work and the time spent in\r\nit.'\"\r\n\r\nYes, Sir, I am decisively under that impression--as decisively as ever\r\nGreek coin was under _its_ impression. You will beat me out of all\r\nshape, if you can beat me out of this. Will you join issue on it, and\r\nare these following statements clear enough for you, either to accept\r\nor deny, in as positive terms?--\r\n\r\nI. A man should in justice be paid for two hours' work twice as much as\r\nfor one hour's work, and for _n_ hour's work _n_ times as much, if the\r\neffort be similar and continuous.\r\n\r\nII. A man should in justice be paid for difficult or dangerous work\r\nproportionately more than for easy and safe work, supposing the other\r\nconditions of the work similar.\r\n\r\nIII. (And now look out, for this proposition involves the ultimate\r\nprinciple of all just wages.) If a man does a given quantity of work\r\nfor me, I am bound in justice to do, or procure to be done, a precisely\r\nequal quantity of work for him; and just trade in labor is the exchange\r\nof equivalent quantities of labor of different kinds.\r\n\r\nIf you pause at this word \"equivalent,\" you shall have definition\r\nof it in my next letter. I am sure you will in fairness insert this\r\nchallenge, whether you accept it or decline.\r\n\r\n                      I am, Sir, your obliged servant,\r\n                                                  JOHN RUSKIN.[45]\r\n\r\n  DENMARK HILL, _Thursday, April_ 20.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[43] The _Gazette_ was at this time of little more than eight weeks'\r\nstanding. The dull leader was that in the _Gazette_ of April 19,\r\nentitled \"Masters and Men,\" and dealt entirely with Mr. Ruskin's letter\r\non strikes. The \"_pace_ Mr. Kingsley\" alludes, of course, to his \"Ode\r\nto the North-East Wind.\"\r\n\r\n[44] The leader had begun by speaking of Mr. Ruskin's previous letter\r\nas \"embodying fallacies, pernicious in the highest degree,\" and\r\nconcluded by remarking how \"easily and unconsciously he glided into the\r\ntrue result of his principles.\"\r\n\r\n[45] In reply, the _Gazette_ denied \"each of the three propositions to\r\nbe true,\" on grounds shown in the quotations given in the following\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From \"The Pall Mall Gazette,\" April 26, 1865.]\r\n\r\n_WORK AND WAGES._\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of \"The Pall Mall Gazette.\"_\r\n\r\nSIR: I accept your terms, and reply in the fewest words I can.\r\n\r\nI. You \"see no injustice in hiring a fly for 2_s._ 6_d._ for the first\r\nhour and 1_s._ 6_d._ for each succeeding one.\" Nor I either; so far\r\nfrom it, that I never give a cabman less than a shilling; which I doubt\r\nnot is your practice also, and a very proper one. The cabmen make\r\nno objection, and you could not have given a neater instance of the\r\nproportion of payment to labor which you deny. You pay in the first\r\nhour for the various trouble involved in taking the man off his stand,\r\nand for a proportion of the time during which he has waited for the\r\nchance of your custom. That paid, you hire him by the formula which I\r\nstate, and you deny.\r\n\r\nII. \"Danger and difficulty have attractions for some men.\" They have,\r\nand if, under the influence of those attractions, they choose to make\r\nyou a present of their labor, for love (in your own terms,[46] \"as you\r\ngive a penny to a beggar\"), you may accept the gift as the beggar does,\r\nwithout question of justice. But if they do not choose to give it you,\r\nthey have a right to higher payment. My guide may perhaps, for love,\r\nplay at climbing Mont Blanc with me; if he will not, he has a right to\r\nbe paid more than for climbing the Breven.\r\n\r\nIII. \"Mr. Ruskin can define justice, or any other word, as he chooses.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a gracious permission; but suppose justice be something more\r\nthan a word! When you derived it _jussum_[47] (falsely, for it is not\r\nderived from _jussum_, but from the root of _jungo_), you forgot, or\r\nignored, that the Saxons had also a word for it, by which the English\r\nworkman still pleads for it; that the Greeks had a word for it, by\r\nwhich Plato and St. Paul reasoned of it; and that the Powers of Heaven\r\nhave, presumably, an idea of it with which it may be well for \"our\r\ninterests\" that your definition, as well as mine, should ultimately\r\ncorrespond, since their \"definitions\" are commonly not by a word but a\r\nblow.\r\n\r\nBut accepting for the nonce your own conception of it as \"the\r\nfulfilment of a compulsory agreement\" (\"the wages\" you say \"which you\r\n_force_ the men to take, and they can _force_ you to pay\"), allow me\r\nto ask your definition of force, or compulsion. As thus: (_Case_ 1.) I\r\nagree with my friend that we will pay a visit to Mr. A. at two in the\r\nmorning. My friend agrees with me that he will hold a pistol to Mr.\r\nA.'s head. Under those circumstances, I agree with Mr. A. that I shall\r\nremove his plate without expression of objection on his part. Is this\r\nagreement, in your sense, \"_jussum_\"? (_Case_ 2.) Mr. B. goes half\r\nthrough the ice into the canal on a frosty morning. I, on the shore,\r\nagree with Mr. B. that I shall have a hundred pounds for throwing him a\r\nrope. Is this agreement validly \"_jussum_\"?\r\n\r\nThe first of these cases expresses in small compass the general nature\r\nof arrangements under compulsory circumstances over which one of the\r\nparties has entire control. The second, that of arrangements made under\r\ncircumstances accidentally compulsory, when the capital is in one\r\nparty's hands exclusively. For you will observe Mr. B. has no right\r\nwhatever to the use of my rope: and that capital (though it would\r\nprobably have been only the final result of my operations with respect\r\nto Mr. A.) makes me completely master of the situation with reference\r\nto Mr. B.\r\n\r\n                      I am, Sir, your obliged servant,\r\n                                                   JOHN RUSKIN[48]\r\n\r\n  DENMARK HILL, _Saturday_, _April_ 22, 1865.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[46] These \"terms\" were simply that the _Gazette_ should have the right\r\nof determining how much of the proposed controversy was worth its space.\r\n\r\n[47] In the article of April 12.\r\n\r\n[48] For the _Gazette's_ reply to this, see the notes to the following\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From \"The Pall Mall Gazette,\" May 2, 1865.]\r\n\r\n_WORK AND WAGES._\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of \"The Pall Mall Gazette.\"_\r\n\r\nSIR: I have not hastened my reply to your last letter, thinking that\r\nyour space at present would be otherwise occupied; having also my own\r\nthoughts busied in various directions, such as you may fancy; yet\r\nbusied chiefly in a sad wonder, which perhaps you would not fancy. I\r\nmourn for Mr. Lincoln,[49] as man should mourn the fate of man, when it\r\nis sudden and supreme. I hate regicide as I do populicide--deeply, if\r\nfrenzied; more deeply, if deliberate. But my wonder is in remembering\r\nthe tone of the English people and press respecting this man during\r\nhis life; and in comparing it with their sayings of him in his death.\r\nThey caricatured and reviled him when his cause was poised in deadly\r\nbalance--when their praise would have been grateful to him, and their\r\nhelp priceless. They now declare his cause to have been just, when\r\nit needs no aid; and his purposes to have been noble, when all human\r\nthoughts of them have become vanity, and will never so much as mix\r\ntheir murmurs in his ears with the sentence of the Tribunal which has\r\nsummoned him to receive a juster praise and tenderer blame than ours.\r\n\r\nI have twice (I see) used the word \"just\" inadvertently, forgetting\r\nthat it has no meaning, or may mean (you tell me) quite what we choose;\r\nand that so far as it has a meaning, \"the important question is not\r\nwhether the action is just.\" Indeed when I read this curious sentence\r\nin your reply on Tuesday last, \"Justice, as we use it, implies merely\r\nthe conformity of an action to any rules whatever, good or bad,\" I\r\nhad nearly closed the discussion by telling you that there remained no\r\nground on which we could meet, for the English workmen, in whose name I\r\nwrote to you, asked, not for conformity with bad rules, but enactment\r\nof good ones. But I will not pounce upon these careless sentences,\r\nwhich you are forced to write in all haste, and at all disadvantage,\r\nwhile I have the definitions and results determined through years of\r\nquiet labor, lying ready at my hand. You never meant what you wrote\r\n(when I said I would not tell you of unconscious meanings, I did not\r\npromise not to tell you of unconscious wants of meanings); but it is\r\nfor you to tell _me_ what you mean by a bad rule, and what by a good\r\none. Of the law of the Eternal Lawgiver, it is dictated that \"the\r\ncommandment is holy, and just, and good.\" Not merely that it is a law;\r\nbut that it is such and such a law. Are these terms senseless to you?\r\nor do you understand by them only that the observance of that law\r\nis generally conducive to our interests? And if so, what _are_ our\r\ninterests? Have we ever an interest in _being_ something, as well as in\r\ngetting something; may not even all getting be at last summed in being?\r\nis it not the uttermost of interests to be just rather than unjust? Let\r\nus leave catching at phrases, and try to look in each other's faces and\r\nhearts; so define our thoughts; then reason from them. [See below.][50]\r\n\r\nYet, lest you say I evade you in generalities, here is present answer\r\npoint by point.\r\n\r\nI. \"The fare has nothing to do with the labor in preparing the fly for\r\nbeing hired.\"--Nor, of course, the price of any article with the labor\r\nexpended in preparing it for being sold? This will be a useful note\r\nto the next edition of \"Ricardo.\" [The price depends on the relative\r\nforces of the buyer and the seller. The price asked by the seller no\r\ndoubt depends on the labor expended. The price given by the buyer\r\ndepends on the degree in which he desires to possess the thing sold,\r\nwhich has nothing to do with the labor laid out on it.]\r\n\r\nThe answer to your instances[51] is that all just price involves an\r\nallowance for average necessary, not for unnecessary, labor. The just\r\nprice of coals at Newcastle does not involve an allowance for their\r\ncarriage to Newcastle. But the just price of a cab at a stand involves\r\nan allowance to the cabman for having stood there. [Why? who is to\r\ndetermine what is necessary?]\r\n\r\nII. \"This admits the principle of Bargaining.\" No, Sir; it only admits\r\nthe principle of Begging. If you like to ask your guide to give you\r\nhis legs for nothing, or your workman his arms for nothing, or your\r\nshopkeeper his goods for nothing, and they consent, for love, or for\r\nplay--you are doubtless both dignified and fortunate; but there is no\r\nquestion of trade in the matters; only of Alms. [We mean by Alms money\r\nor goods given merely from motives of benevolence, and without return.\r\nIn the case supposed the guide goes one mile to please himself, and ten\r\nmore for hire, which satisfies him. How does he give Alms? He goes for\r\nless money than he otherwise would require, because _he_ likes the job,\r\nnot because his employer likes it. The Alms are thus given by himself\r\nto himself.]\r\n\r\nIII. It is true that \"every one can affix to words any sense he\r\nchooses.\" But if I pay for a yard of broadcloth, and the shopman cuts\r\nme three-quarters, I shall not put up with my loss more patiently on\r\nbeing informed that Bishop Butler meant by justice something quite\r\ndifferent from what Bentham meant by it, or that to give for every yard\r\nthree-quarters, is the rule of that establishment. [If the word \"yard\"\r\nwere as ambiguous as the word \"justice,\" Mr. Ruskin ought to be much\r\nobliged to the shopman for defining his sense of it, especially if he\r\ngave you full notice before he cut the cloth.]\r\n\r\nFurther, it is easy to ascertain the uses of words by the best\r\nscholars--[Nothing is more difficult. To ascertain what Locke meant by\r\nan \"idea,\" or Sir W. Hamilton by the word \"inconceivable,\" is no easy\r\ntask.]--and well to adopt them, because they are sure to be founded\r\non the feelings of gentlemen.--[Different gentlemen feel and think in\r\nvery different ways. Though we differ from Mr. Ruskin, we hope he will\r\nnot deny this.] Thus, when Horace couples his _tenacem propositi_ with\r\n_justum_, he means to assert that the tenacity is only noble which is\r\njustified by uprightness, and shows itself by insuffer-ance of the\r\n_jussa_ \"_prava jubentium_\" And although Portia does indeed accept your\r\ndefinition of justice from the lips of Shylock, changing the divine,\r\n\"who sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not\" into the somewhat less\r\ndivine \"who sweareth to his neighbor's hurt and changeth not;\" and\r\nthough she carries out his and your conception of such justice to the\r\nuttermost, the result is not, even in Shylock's view of it, \"for the\r\ninterest of both parties.\"\r\n\r\nIV. To your two final questions \"exhausting\" (by no means, my dear\r\nSir, I assure you) \"the points at issue,\"[52] I reply in both cases,\r\n\"No.\" And to your plaintive \"why should they do so?\" while, observe, I\r\ndo not admit it to be a monstrous requirement of men that they should\r\nsometimes sacrifice their own interests, I would for the present merely\r\nanswer that I have never found my own interests seriously compromised\r\nby my practice, which is, when I cannot get the fair price of a thing,\r\nnot to sell it, and when I cannot give the fair price of a thing, not\r\nto buy it. The other day, a dealer in want of money offered me a series\r\nof Hartz minerals for two-thirds of their value. I knew their value,\r\nbut did not care to spend the entire sum which would have covered it. I\r\ntherefore chose forty specimens out of the seventy, and gave the dealer\r\nwhat he asked for the whole.\r\n\r\nIn the example you give, it is _not_ the interest of the guide to take\r\nhis fifty francs rather than nothing; because all future travellers,\r\nthough they could afford the hundred, would then say, \"You went for\r\nfifty; we will give you no more.\" [Does a man say to a broker, \"You\r\nsold stock yesterday at 90; I will pay no more to-day\"?] And for me,\r\nif I am not able to pay my hundred francs, I either forego Mont Blanc,\r\nor climb alone; and keep my fifty francs to pay at another time, for a\r\nless service, some man who also would have got nothing otherwise, and\r\nwho will be honestly paid by what I give him, for what I ask of him.\r\n\r\n                      I am, Sir, your obliged servant,\r\n                                                     JOHN RUSKIN.\r\n\r\n  SATURDAY, _29th April_, 1865.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[49] President Lincoln was shot while in his private box at Ford's\r\nTheatre, Washington, on the night of April 14, 1865, and died early the\r\nnext morning. His assassin, J. Wilkes Booth, was pursued to Caroline\r\nCounty, Virginia, where he was fired on by the soldiery and killed. A\r\nletter was found upon him ascribing his conduct to his devotion to the\r\nSouthern States.\r\n\r\n[50] The bracketed [_sic_] interpolations are the remarks of the\r\n_Gazette_.\r\n\r\n[51] One of the instances given by the _Gazette_ on this point was that\r\na sovereign made of Californian gold will not buy more wool at Sydney\r\nthan a sovereign made of Australian gold, although far more labor will\r\nhave been expended in bringing it to Sydney.\r\n\r\n[52] The _Gazette's_ criticism on the previous letter had concluded\r\nthus:\r\n\r\nThe following questions exhaust the points at issue between Mr. Ruskin\r\nand ourselves:\r\n\r\nIs every man bound to purchase any service or any goods offered him at\r\na \"just\" price, he having the money?\r\n\r\nIf yes, there is an end of private property.\r\n\r\nIf no, the purchaser must be at liberty to refuse to buy if it suits\r\nhis interest to do so. Suppose he does refuse, and thereupon the seller\r\noffers to lower his price, it being his interest to do so, is the\r\npurchaser at liberty to accept that offer?\r\n\r\nIf yes, the whole principle of bargaining is admitted, and the\r\n\"justice\" of the price becomes immaterial.\r\n\r\nIf no, each party of the supposition is compelled by justice to\r\nsacrifice their interest. Why should they do so?\r\n\r\nThe following is an example: The \"just\" price of a guide up Mont Blanc\r\nis (suppose) 100 francs. I have only 50 francs to spare. May I without\r\ninjustice offer the 50 francs to a guide, who would otherwise get\r\nnothing, and may he without injustice accept my offer? If not, I lose\r\nmy excursion, and he loses his opportunity of earning 50 francs. Why\r\nshould this be?\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above interpolations, the _Gazette_ appended a\r\nnote to this letter, in which it declared its definition of justice\r\nto be a quotation from memory of Austin's definition adopted by him\r\nfrom Hobbes, and after referring Mr. Ruskin to Austin for the _moral_\r\nbearings of the question, concluded by summing up its views, which it\r\ndoubted if Mr. Ruskin understood, and insisting on the definition of\r\n\"justice\" as \"conformity with any rule whatever, good or bad,\" and on\r\nthat of _good_ rules as \"those which promote the general happiness of\r\nthose whom they affect.\" (See the next letter.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From \"The Pall Mall Gazette,\" May 9, 1865.]\r\n\r\n_WORK AND WAGES._\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of \"The Pall Mall Gazette.\"_\r\n\r\nSIR: I am under the impression that we are both getting prosy, or,\r\nat all events, that no one will read either my last letter, or your\r\ncomments upon it, in the places in which you have so gracefully\r\nintroduced them. For which I am sorry, and you, I imagine, are not.\r\n\r\nIt is true that differences of feeling may exist among gentlemen;\r\nyet I think that gentlemen of all countries agree that it is rude to\r\ninterrupt your opponent while he is speaking; for a futile answer gains\r\nno real force by becoming an interjection; and a strong one can abide\r\nits time. I will therefore pray you, in future, if you publish my\r\nletters at all, to practice towards them so much of old English manners\r\nas may yet be found lingering round some old English dinner-tables;\r\nwhere, though we may be compelled by fashion to turn the room into a\r\ngreenhouse, and serve everything cold, the _pièces de résistance_ are\r\nstill presented whole, and carved afterwards.\r\n\r\nOf course it is open to you to reply that I dislike close argument.\r\nWhich little flourish being executed, and if you are well breathed--_en\r\ngarde_, if you please.\r\n\r\nI. Your original position was that wages (or price) bear _no_ relation\r\nto hardship of work. On that I asked you to join issue. You now admit,\r\nthough with apparent reluctance, that \"the price asked by the seller,\r\nno doubt, depends on the labor expended.\"\r\n\r\nThe price asked by the seller has, I believe, in respectable commercial\r\nhouses, and respectable shops, very approximate relation to the price\r\npaid by the buyer. I do not know if you are in the habit of asking,\r\nfrom your wine-merchant or tailor, reduction of price on the ground\r\nthat the sum remitted will be \"alms to themselves;\" but, having been\r\nmyself in somewhat intimate connection with a house of business in the\r\nCity,[53] not dishonorably accounted of during the last forty years,\r\nI know enough of their correspondents in every important town in the\r\nUnited Kingdom to be sure that they will bear me witness that the\r\ndifference between the prices asked and the prices taken was always a\r\nvery \"imaginary\" quantity.\r\n\r\nBut urging this no farther for the present, and marking, for gained\r\nground, only your admission that \"the price asked depends on the\r\nlabor expended,\" will you farther tell me, whether that dependence is\r\nconstant, or variable? If constant, under what law; if variable, within\r\nwhat limits?\r\n\r\nII. \"The alms are thus given by himself to himself.\" I never said\r\nthey were not. I said it was a question of alms, not of trade. And if\r\nyour original leader had only been an exhortation to English workmen\r\nto consider every diminution of their pay, in the picturesque though\r\nperhaps somewhat dim, religious light of alms paid by themselves to\r\nthemselves, I never should have troubled you with a letter on the\r\nsubject. For, singular enough, Sir, this is not one of the passages of\r\nyour letters, however apparently indefensible, which I care to attack.\r\n\r\nSo far from it, in my own serious writings I have always maintained\r\nthat the best work is done, and can only be done, for love.[54] But the\r\npoint at issue between us is not whether there _should_ be charity,\r\nbut whether there _can_ be trade; not whether men may give away their\r\nlabor, but whether, if they do not choose to do so, there is such a\r\nthing as a price for it. And my statement, as opposed to yours, is\r\nbriefly this--that for all labor, there is, under given circumstances,\r\na just price approximately determinable; that every conscious\r\ndeflection from this price towards zero is either gift on the part\r\nof the laborer, or theft on the part of the employer; and that all\r\npayment in conscious excess of this price is either theft on the part\r\nof the laborer, or gift on that of the employer.\r\n\r\nIII. If you wish to substitute the word \"moral\" for \"just\" in the above\r\nstatement, I am prepared to allow the substitution; only, as you, not\r\nI, introduced this new word, I must pray for your definition of it\r\nfirst, whether remembered from Mr. Hobbes, or original.\r\n\r\nIV. I am sorry you doubt my understanding your views; but, in that\r\ncase, it may be well to ask for a word or two of farther elucidation.\r\n\r\n\"Justice,\" you say, is \"conformity with any rule whatever, good or\r\nbad.\" And \"good rules are rules which promote the general happiness\r\nof those whom they affect.\" And bad rules are (therefore) rules\r\nwhich promote the general misery of those whom they affect? Justice,\r\ntherefore, may as often as not promote the general misery of those who\r\npractice it? Do you intend this?[55]\r\n\r\nAgain: \"Good rules are rules which promote the general happiness of\r\nthose whom they affect.\" But \"the greatest happiness of the greatest\r\nnumber is best secured by laying down no rule at all\" (as to the price\r\nof \"labor\").\r\n\r\nDo you propose this as a sequitur? For if not, it is merely a _petitio\r\nprincipii_, and a somewhat wide one.

When you said, in your first reply to me, that\r\nmy letter embodied fallacies which appeared to you pernicious in the\r\nhighest degree, _I_ also \"could not consider this sort of language\r\nwell judged.\" When you called one of your own questions an answer, and\r\ndeclared it to be \"simple and perfectly conclusive,\" I thought the\r\nflourish might have been spared; and for having accused you of writing\r\ncarelessly, I must hope your pardon; for the discourtesy, in my mind,\r\nwould have been in imagining you to be writing with care.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I should hold it discourteous to suppose you unaware of\r\nthe ordinary distinction between law and equity: yet no consciousness\r\nof such a distinction appears in your articles. I should hold it\r\ndiscourteous to doubt your acquaintance with the elementary principles\r\nlaid down by the great jurists of all nations respecting Divine\r\nand Human law; yet such a doubt forces itself on me if I consider\r\nyour replies as deliberate. And I should decline to continue the\r\ndiscussion with an opponent who could conceive of justice as (under any\r\ncircumstances) \"an hideously bad thing,\" if I did not suppose him to\r\nhave mistaken the hideousness of justice, in certain phases, to certain\r\npersons, for its ultimate nature and power.\r\n\r\nThere may be question respecting these inaccuracies of thought; there\r\ncan be none respecting the carelessness of expression which causes the\r\nphrases \"are\" and \"ought to be\" to alternate in your articles as if\r\nthey were alike in meaning.\r\n\r\nI have permitted this, that I might see the course of your argument\r\nin your own terms, but it is now needful that the confusion should\r\ncease. That wages _are_ determined by supply and demand is no proof\r\nthat under any circumstances they must be--still less that under all\r\ncircumstances they ought to be. Permit me, therefore, to know the\r\nsense in which you use the word \"ought\" in your paragraph lettered\r\n_b_, page 832[56] (second column), and to ask whether the words \"due,\"\r\n\"duty,\" \"devoir,\" and other such, connected in idea with the first and\r\nthird of the \"præcepta juris\" of Justinian, quoted by Blackstone as a\r\nsummary of the whole doctrine of law (_honeste vivere,--alterum non\r\nlædere,--suumque cuique tribuere_), are without meaning to you except\r\nas conditions of agreement?[57] Whether, in fact, there be, in your\r\nview, any _honos_, absolutely; or whether we are to launch out into an\r\nhistorical investigation of the several kinds of happiness enjoyed in\r\nlives of rapine, of selfish trade, and of unselfish citizenship, and to\r\ndecide only upon evidence whether we will live as pirates, as pedlers,\r\nor as gentlemen? If so, while I shall be glad to see you undertake,\r\nindependently, so interesting an inquiry, I must reserve my comments on\r\nit until its close.\r\n\r\nBut if you admit an absolute idea of a \"devoir\" of one man to another,\r\nand of every honorable man to himself, tell me why you dissent from my\r\nstatement of the terms of that debt in the opening of this discussion.\r\nObserve, I asked for no evangelical virtue of returning good for evil:\r\nI asked only for the Sinaitic equity of return in good for good, as\r\nfor Sinaitic equity of return in evil for evil. \"Eye for eye,\" \"tooth\r\nfor tooth\"--be it so; but will you thus pray according to the _lex\r\ntalionis_ and not according to the _lex gratiæ_? Your debt is on both\r\nsides. Does a man take of your life, you take also of his. Shall he\r\ngive you of his life, and will you not give him also of yours? If this\r\nbe not your law of duty to him, tell me what other there is, or if you\r\nverily believe there is none.\r\n\r\nBut you ask of such repayment, \"Who shall determine how much?\"[58]\r\nI took no notice of the question, irrelevant when you asked it; but\r\nin its broad bearing it is the one imperative question of national\r\neconomy. Of old, as at bridge-foot of Florence, men regulated their\r\nrevenge by the law of demand and supply, and asked in measureless\r\nanger, \"Who shall determine how much?\" with economy of blood, such as\r\nwe know. That \"much\" is now, with some approximate equity, determined\r\nat the judgment-seat, but for the other debt, the debt of love, we have\r\nno law but that of the wolf, and the locust, and the \"fishes of the\r\nsea, which have no ruler over them.\" The workmen of England--of the\r\nworld, ask for the return--as of wrath, so of reward by law; and for\r\nblood resolutely spent, as for that recklessly shed; for life devoted\r\nthrough its duration, as for that untimely cast away; they require from\r\nyou to determine, in judgment, the equities of \"Human Retribution.\"\r\n\r\n                     I am, Sir, your faithful servant,\r\n                                                    J.

And within limits varying by\r\nexceedingly minor and unimportant circumstances, it is an ascertainable\r\nquantity. I told the public this five years ago, and--under pardon of\r\nyour politico-economical contributor, it is not a sentimental, but a\r\nchemical, fact. Let any half-dozen London physicians of recognized\r\nstanding state in precise terms the quantity and kind of food, and\r\nspace of lodging, they consider approximately necessary for the healthy\r\nlife of a laborer in any given manufacture, and the number of hours\r\nhe may, without shortening his life, work at such business daily, if\r\nin such manner he be sustained. Let all masters be bound to give their\r\nmen a choice between an order for that quantity of food and space\r\nof lodging, or the market wages for that specified number of hours\r\nof work. Proper laws for the maintenance of families would require\r\nfurther concession; but in the outset, let but this law of wages be\r\nestablished, and if then we have more strikes, you may denounce them\r\nwithout one word of remonstrance either from sense or sensibility.\r\n\r\n                I am, Sir, with sentiments of great respect,\r\n                           Your faithful servant,\r\n                                                     JOHN RUSKIN.\r\n\r\n  DENMARK HILL, _April_ 30, 1867.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[60] As regards \"strikes,\" it is of interest to note the following\r\namendment proposed by Mr. Ruskin at a special meeting of the National\r\nAssociation for the Promotion of Social Science on the subject, held\r\nin 1868: \"That, in the opinion of this meeting, the interests of\r\nworkmen and their employers are at present opposed, and can only become\r\nidentical when all are equally employed in defined labor and recognized\r\nduty, and all, from the highest to the lowest, are paid fixed salaries,\r\nproportioned to the value of their services and sufficient for their\r\nhonorable maintenance in the situations of life properly occupied by\r\nthem.\"--_Daily Telegraph_, July 16, 1868.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From \"The Pall Mall Gazette,\" January 24, 1873.]\r\n\r\n_HOW THE RICH SPEND THEIR MONEY._\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of \"The Pall Mall Gazette.\"_\r\n\r\nSIR: Here among the hills, I read little, and withstand, sometimes for\r\na fortnight together, even the attractions of my _Pall Mall Gazette_.\r\nA friend, however, sent me, two days ago, your article signed W. R.\r\nG. on spending of money (January 13),[61] which, as I happened to\r\nhave over-eaten myself the day before, and taken perhaps a glass too\r\nmuch besides of quite priceless port (Quarles Harris, twenty years in\r\nbottle), would have been a great comfort to my mind, showing me that\r\nif I had done some harm to myself, I had at least conferred benefit\r\nupon the poor by these excesses, had I not been left in some painful\r\ndoubt, even at the end of W. R. G.'s most intelligent illustrations,\r\nwhether I ought not to have exerted myself further in the cause of\r\nhumanity, and by the use of some cathartic process, such as appears\r\nto have been without inconvenience practised by the ancients, enabled\r\nmyself to eat two dinners instead of one. But I write to you to-day,\r\nbecause if I were a poor man, instead of a (moderately) rich one, I am\r\nnearly certain that W. R. G.'s paper would suggest to me a question,\r\nwhich I am sure he will kindly answer in your columns, namely, \"These\r\nmeans of living, which this generous and useful gentleman is so\r\nfortunately disposed to bestow on me--where does he get them himself?\"\r\n\r\n                     I am, Sir, your faithful servant,\r\n                                                       J. RUSKIN.\r\n\r\n  BRANTWOOD, CONISTON, _Jan._ 23.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[61] The article, or rather letter, dealt with a paper on \"The Labor\r\nMovement\" by Mr. Goldwin Smith in the _Contemporary Review_ of\r\nDecember, 1872, and especially with the following sentences in it:\r\n\"When did wealth rear such enchanted palaces of luxury as it is rearing\r\nin England at the present day? Well do I remember one of those palaces,\r\nthe most conspicuous object for miles round. Its lord was, I dare say,\r\nconsuming the income of some hundreds of the poor laboring families\r\naround him. The thought that you are spending on yourself annually the\r\nincome of six hundred laboring families seems to me as much as a man\r\nwith a heart and a brain can bear.\" W. R. G.'s letter argued that this\r\n\"heartless expenditure all goes into the pockets\" of the poor families,\r\nwho are thus benefited by the selfish luxuries of the lord in his\r\npalace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From \"The Pall Mall Gazette,\" January 29, 1873.]\r\n\r\n_HOW THE RICH SPEND THEIR MONEY._\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of \"The Pall Mall Gazette.\"_\r\n\r\nSIR: I am disappointed of my _Gazette_ to-day, and shall be grievously\r\nbusy to morrow. I think it better, therefore, to follow up my own\r\nletter, if you will permit me, with a simple and brief statement of the\r\nfacts, than to wait till I see your correspondent W. R. G.'s reply, if\r\nhe has vouchsafed me one.\r\n\r\nThese are the facts. The laborious poor produce \"the means of life\"\r\nby their labor. Rich persons possess themselves by various expedients\r\nof a right to dispense these \"means of life,\" and keeping as much\r\nmeans as they want of it for themselves, and rather more, dispense the\r\nrest, usually only in return for more labor from the poor, expended\r\nin producing various delights for the rich dispenser. The idea is\r\nnow gradually entering poor men's minds, that they may as well keep\r\nin their own hands the right of distributing \"the means of life\" they\r\nproduce; and employ themselves, so far as they need extra occupation,\r\nfor their own entertainment or benefit, rather than that of other\r\npeople. There is something to be said, nevertheless, in favor of the\r\npresent arrangement, but it cannot be defended in disguise; and it is\r\nimpossible to do more harm to the cause of order, or the rights of\r\nproperty, than by endeavors, such as that of your correspondent, to\r\nrevive the absurd and, among all vigorous thinkers, long since exploded\r\nnotion of the dependence of the poor upon the rich.\r\n\r\n                     I am, Sir, your obedient servant,\r\n                                                      J.

So\r\nstraightforward indeed that I particularly dislike making a martyr of\r\nmyself in answering it, as I must this blessed day--a martyr, at least,\r\nin the way of witness; for if we rich people don't begin to speak\r\nhonestly with our tongues, we shall, some day soon, lose them and our\r\nheads together, having for some time back, most of us, made false use\r\nof the one and none of the other. Well, for the point in question then,\r\nas to means of living: the most exemplary manner of answer is simply\r\nto state how I got my own, or rather how my father got them for me. He\r\nand his partners entered into what your correspondent mellifluously\r\nstyles \"a mutually beneficent partnership,\"[62] with certain laborers\r\nin Spain. These laborers produced from the earth annually a certain\r\nnumber of bottles of wine. These productions were sold by my father\r\nand his partners, who kept nine-tenths, or thereabouts, of the price\r\nthemselves, and gave one-tenth, or thereabouts, to the laborers. In\r\nwhich state of mutual beneficence my father and his partners naturally\r\nbecame rich, and the laborers as naturally remained poor. Then my good\r\nfather gave all his money to me (who never did a stroke of work in my\r\nlife worth my salt, not to mention my dinner), and so far from finding\r\nhis money \"grow\" in my hands, I never try to buy anything with it;\r\nbut people tell me \"money isn't what it was in your father's time,\r\neverything is so much dearer.\" I should be heartily glad to learn from\r\nyour correspondent as much pecuniary botany as will enable me to set\r\nmy money a-growing; and in the mean time, as I have thus given a quite\r\nindubitable instance of my notions of the way money is made, will he be\r\nso kind as to give us, not an heraldic example in the dark ages (though\r\nI suspect I know more of the pedigree of money, if he comes to that,\r\nthan he does),[63] but a living example of a rich gentleman who _has_\r\nmade his money by saving an _equal_ portion of profit in some mutually\r\nbeneficent partnership with his laborers?\r\n\r\n                     I am, Sir, your obedient servant,\r\n                                                       J.

May I beg your\r\ncorrespondent to explain, for your readers' benefit, this charming case\r\nof hereditary accumulation?\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[62] W. R. G. had declared that the rich man (or his ancestors) got the\r\nmoney \"by co-operation with the poor ... by, in fact, entering into a\r\nmutually beneficent partnership with them, and advancing them their\r\nshare of the joint profits ... paying them beforehand, in a word.\"\r\n\r\n[63] W. R. G. had written: \"In nine cases out of ten, in the case of\r\nacquired wealth, we should probably find, were the pedigree traced\r\nfairly and far back enough, that the original difference between the\r\nnow rich man and the now poor man was, that the latter habitually spent\r\nall his earnings, and the former habitually saved a portion of his in\r\norder that it might accumulate and fructify.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Date and place of publication unknown.]\r\n\r\n_COMMERCIAL MORALITY._[64]\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR: Mr. Johnson's speech in the Manchester Chamber of\r\nCommerce, which you favor me by sending, appears to me the most\r\nimportant event that has occurred in relation to the true interests of\r\nthe country during my lifetime.

Mr. Johnson's address\r\ndealt with the immorality of cheapness, the duties of merchants and\r\nmanufacturers as public servants, and the nobility of trade as a\r\nprofession which, when rightly and unselfishly conducted, would yield\r\nto no other \"in the dignity of its nature and in the employment that it\r\noffers to the highest faculties of man.\"\r\n\r\n[65] In \"Fors Clavigera,\" March, 1875, Mr. Johnson's speech is named\r\n(p. 54) as \"the first living words respecting commerce which I have\r\never known to be spoken in England, in my time,\" but the discussion of\r\nit is postponed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From \"The Monetary and Mining Gazette,\" November 13, 1875.]\r\n\r\n_THE DEFINITION OF WEALTH._\r\n\r\n  CORPUS CHRISTI COLLEGE, OXFORD,\r\n             _9th November_, 1875.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of \"The Monetary Gazette.\"_\r\n\r\nSIR: I congratulate you with all my mind on the sense, and with all my\r\nheart on the courage, of your last Saturday's leading article, which I\r\nhave just seen.[66] You have asserted in it the two vital principles of\r\neconomy, that society cannot exist by reciprocal pilfering, but must\r\nproduce wealth if it would have it; and that money must not be lent,\r\nbut administered by its masters.\r\n\r\nYou have not yet, however, defined wealth itself, or told the ingenuity\r\nof the public what it is to produce.\r\n\r\nI have never been able to obtain this definition from economists;[67]\r\nperhaps, under the pressure of facts, they may at last discover some\r\nmeaning in mine at the tenth and eleventh pages of \"Munera Pulveris.\"\r\n\r\n  I am, Sir, your obedient servant,\r\n                                    J.

Might you not invite\r\nletters on this quite radical and essential question--how money is\r\ntruly made, and how it is truly lost, not by one person or another, but\r\nby the whole nation?\r\n\r\nFor, practically, people's eyes are so intensely fixed on the immediate\r\noperation of money as it changes hands, that they hardly ever reflect\r\non its first origin or final disappearance. They are always considering\r\nhow to get it from somebody else, but never how to get it where that\r\nsomebody else got it.\r\n\r\nAlso, they very naturally mourn over their loss of it to other people,\r\nwithout reflecting that, if not lost altogether, it may still be of\r\nsome reflective advantage to them. Whereas, the real national question\r\nis not who is losing or gaining money, but who is making and who\r\ndestroying it. I do not of course mean making money, in the sense of\r\nprinting notes or finding gold. True money cannot be so made. When an\r\nisland is too small for its inhabitants, it would not help them to one\r\nounce of bread more to have the entire island turned into one nugget,\r\nor to find bank notes growing by its rivulets instead of fern leaves.\r\nNeither, by destroying money, do I mean burning notes, or throwing\r\ngold away. If I burn a five-pound note, or throw five sovereigns\r\ninto the sea, I hurt no one but myself; nay, I benefit others, for\r\neverybody with a pound in his pocket is richer by the withdrawal of my\r\ncompetition in the market. But what I want you to make your readers\r\ndiscover is how the _true_ money is made that will get them houses\r\nand dinners; and on the other hand how money is truly lost, or so\r\ndiminished in value that all they can get in a year will not buy them\r\ncomfortable houses, nor satisfactory dinners.\r\n\r\nSurely this is a question which people would like to have clearly\r\nanswered for them, and it might lead to some important results if the\r\nanswer were acted upon. The riband-makers at Coventry, starving, invite\r\nthe ladies of England to wear ribands. The compassionate ladies of\r\nEngland invest themselves in rainbows, and admiring economists declare\r\nthe nation to be benefited. No one asks where the ladies got the money\r\nto spend in rainbows (which is the first question in the business), nor\r\nwhether the money once so spent will ever return again, or has really\r\nfaded with the faded ribands and disappeared forever. Again, honest\r\npeople every day lose quantities of money to dishonest people. But that\r\nis merely a change of hands much to be regretted; but the money is\r\nnot therefore itself lost; the dishonest people must spend it at last\r\nsomehow. A youth at college loses his year's income to a Jew. But the\r\nJew must spend it instead of him. Miser or not, the day must come when\r\nhis hands relax. A railroad shareholder loses his money to a director;\r\nbut the director must some day spend it instead of him. That is not--at\r\nleast in the first fact of it--_national_ loss. But what the public\r\nneed to know is, how a final and perfect _loss_ of money takes place,\r\nso that the whole nation, instead of being rich, shall be getting\r\ngradually poor. And then, indeed, if one man in spending his money\r\ndestroys it, and another in spending it makes more of it, it becomes a\r\ngrave question in whose hands it is, and whether honest or dishonest\r\npeople are likely to spend it to the best purpose. Will you permit\r\nme, Sir, to lay this not unprofitable subject of inquiry before your\r\nreaders, while, to the very best purpose, they are investing a little\r\nmoney in sea air?\r\n\r\n                           Very sincerely yours,\r\n                                                       J. RUSKIN.\r\n\r\n  DENMARK HILL, _July_ 30.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[72] The discussion had been carried on in a series of letters from\r\na great number of correspondents under the heading of \"Marriage or\r\nCelibacy,\" its subject being the pecuniary difficulties in the way\r\nof early marriage. The _Daily Telegraph_ of July 30 concluded the\r\ndiscussion with a leading article, in which it characterized the\r\ngeneral nature of the correspondence, and of which the final words were\r\nthose quoted by Mr. Ruskin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From \"The Daily Telegraph,\" August 6, 1868.]\r\n\r\n_THE OWNERSHIP OF RAILWAYS._[73]\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of \"The Daily Telegraph.\"_\r\n\r\nSIR: The ingenious British public seems to be discovering, to its\r\ncost, that the beautiful law of supply and demand does not apply in\r\na pleasant manner to railroad transit. But if they are prepared to\r\nsubmit patiently to the \"natural\" laws of political economy, what\r\nright have they to complain? The railroad belongs to the shareholders;\r\nand has not everybody a right to ask the highest price he can get for\r\nhis wares? The public have a perfect right to walk, or to make other\r\nopposition railroads for themselves, if they please, but not to abuse\r\nthe shareholders for asking as much as they think they can get.\r\n\r\nWill you allow me to put the _real_ rights of the matter before them in\r\na few words?\r\n\r\nNeither the roads nor the railroads of any nation should belong to any\r\nprivate persons. All means of public transit should be provided at\r\npublic expense, by public determination where such means are needed,\r\nand the public should be its own \"shareholder.\"\r\n\r\nNeither road, nor railroad, nor canal should ever pay dividends to\r\nanybody. They should pay their working expenses, and no more. All\r\ndividends are simply a tax on the traveller and the goods, levied by\r\nthe person to whom the road or canal belongs, for the right of passing\r\nover his property. And this right should at once be purchased by the\r\nnation, and the original cost of the roadway--be it of gravel, iron, or\r\nadamant--at once defrayed by the nation, and then the whole work of the\r\ncarriage of persons or goods done for ascertained prices, by salaried\r\nofficers, as the carriage of letters is done now.\r\n\r\nI believe, if the votes of the proprietors of all the railroads in the\r\nkingdom were taken _en masse_, it would be found that the majority\r\nwould gladly receive back their original capital, and cede their right\r\nof \"revising\" prices of railway tickets. And if railway property _is_\r\na good and wise investment of capital, the public need not shrink from\r\ntaking the whole off their hands. Let the public take it. (I, for one,\r\nwho never held a rag of railroad scrip in my life, nor ever willingly\r\ntravelled behind an engine where a horse could pull me, will most\r\ngladly subscribe my proper share for such purchase according to my\r\nincome.) Then let them examine what lines pay their working expenses\r\nand what lines do not, and boldly leave the un-paying embankments to\r\nbe white over with sheep, like Roman camps, take up the working lines\r\non sound principles, pay their drivers and pointsmen well, keep their\r\ncarriages clean and in good repair, and make it as wonderful a thing\r\nfor a train, as for an old mail-coach, to be behind its time; and the\r\nsagacious British public will very soon find its pocket heavier, its\r\nheart lighter, and its \"passages\" pleasanter, than any of the three\r\nhave been, for many a day.\r\n\r\n                    I am, Sir, always faithfully yours,\r\n                                                       J. RUSKIN.\r\n\r\n  DENMARK HILL, _Aug._ 5.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[73] In the _Daily Telegraph_ of August 3 appeared eight letters, all\r\nof which, under the heading of \"Increased Railway Fares,\" complained of\r\nthe price of tickets on various lines having been suddenly raised. In\r\nthe issue of August 4 eighteen letters appeared on the subject, whilst\r\nin that of the 5th there were again eight letters. Mr. Ruskin's letter\r\nwas one of four in the issue of the 6th. It has, it will be seen, no\r\ndirect connection with that one entitled, \"Is England Big Enough?\"\r\nwhich precedes it in these volumes owing to the allusions to it in one\r\nof these railway letters (p. 86).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From \"The Daily Telegraph,\" August 10, 1868.]\r\n\r\n_RAILWAY ECONOMY._\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of \"The Daily Telegraph.\"_\r\n\r\nSIR: I had not intended again to trespass on your space until I could\r\nobtain a general idea of the views of your correspondents on the\r\nquestions you permitted me to lay before them in my letters of the\r\n31st July and 5th inst.; but I must ask you to allow me to correct\r\nan impression likely to be created by your reference to that second\r\nletter in your interesting article on the Great Eastern Railway, and to\r\nreply briefly to the question of your correspondent \"S.\" on the same\r\nsubject.[74]\r\n\r\nYou say that I mistook the charge against the railway companies in\r\ntaunting my unfortunate neighbors at Sydenham[75] with their complaints\r\nagainst the operation of the law of supply and demand, and that it was\r\nbecause the companies neglected that law that they suffered.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, the law of supply and demand, as believed in by the British\r\npublic under the guidance of their economists, is a natural law\r\nregulating prices, which it is not at all in their option to \"neglect.\"\r\nAnd it is precisely because I have always declared that there is no\r\nsuch natural law, but that prices can be, and ought to be, regulated by\r\nlaws of expediency and justice, that political economists have thought\r\nI did not understand their science, and you now say I laugh at it. No,\r\nSir, I laughed only at what was clearly no science, but vain endeavor\r\nto allege as irresistible natural law, what is indeed a too easily\r\nresisted prudential law, rewarding and chastising us according to our\r\nobedience. So far from despising true political economy, based on such\r\nprudential law, I have for years been chiefly occupied in defending its\r\nconclusions, having given this definition of it in 1862. \"Political\r\nEconomy is neither an art nor a science; but a system of conduct and\r\nlegislature founded on the sciences, including the arts, and impossible\r\nexcept under certain conditions of moral culture.\"[76]\r\n\r\nAnd, Sir, nothing could better show the evil of competition as opposed\r\nto the equitable regulation of prices than the instance to which you\r\nrefer your correspondent \"Fair Play\"--the agitation in Brighton for a\r\nsecond railway. True prudential law would make one railway serve it\r\nthoroughly, and fix the fares necessary to pay for thorough service.\r\nCompetition will make two railways (sinking twice the capital really\r\nrequired); then, if the two companies combine, they can oppress the\r\npublic as effectively as one could; if they do not, they will keep the\r\nsaid public in dirty carriages and in danger of its life, by lowering\r\nthe working expenses to a minimum in their antagonism.\r\n\r\nNext, to the question of your correspondent \"S.,\" \"what I expect the\r\ncapitalist to do with his money,\" so far as it is asked in good faith\r\nI gladly reply, that no one's \"expectations\" are in this matter of the\r\nslightest consequence; but that the moral laws which properly regulate\r\nthe disposition of revenue, and the physical laws which determine\r\nreturns proportioned to the wisdom of its employment, are of the\r\ngreatest consequence; and these may be briefly stated as follows:\r\n\r\n1. All capital is justly and rationally invested which supports\r\nproductive labor (that is to say, labor directly producing or\r\ndistributing good food, clothes, lodging, or fuel); so long as it\r\nrenders to the possessor of the capital, and to those whom he employs,\r\nonly such gain as shall justly remunerate the superintendence and\r\nlabor given to the business, and maintain both master and operative\r\nhappily in the positions of life involved by their several functions.\r\nAnd it is highly advantageous for the nation that wise superintendence\r\nand honest labor should both be highly rewarded. But all rates of\r\ninterest or modes of profit on capital, which render possible the rapid\r\naccumulation of fortunes, are simply forms of taxation, by individuals,\r\non labor, purchase, or transport; and are highly detrimental to the\r\nnational interests, being, indeed, no means of national gain, but only\r\nthe abstraction of small gains from many to form the large gain of one.\r\nFor, though inequality of fortune is not in itself an evil, but in many\r\nrespects desirable, it is always an evil when unjustly or stealthily\r\nobtained, since the men who desire to make fortunes by large interest\r\nare precisely those who will make the worst use of their wealth.\r\n\r\n2. Capital sunk in the production of objects which do not\r\nimmediately support life (as statues, pictures, architecture, books,\r\ngarden-flowers, and the like) is beneficially sunk if the things thus\r\nproduced are good of their kind, and honestly desired by the nation for\r\ntheir own sake; but it is sunk ruinously if they are bad of their kind,\r\nor desired only for pride or gain. Neither can good art be produced as\r\nan \"investment.\" You cannot build a good cathedral if you only build it\r\nthat you may charge sixpence for entrance.\r\n\r\n3. \"Private enterprise\" should never be interfered with, but, on the\r\ncontrary, much encouraged, so long as it is indeed \"enterprise\" (the\r\nexercise of individual ingenuity and audacity in new fields of true\r\nlabor), and so long as it is indeed \"private,\" paying its way at\r\nits own cost, and in no wise harmfully affecting public comforts or\r\ninterests. But \"private enterprise\" which poisons its neighborhood, or\r\nspeculates for individual gain at common risk, is very sharply to be\r\ninterfered with.\r\n\r\n4. All enterprise, constantly and demonstrably profitable on\r\nascertained conditions, should be made public enterprise, under\r\nGovernment administration and security; and the funds now innocently\r\ncontributed, and too often far from innocently absorbed, in vain\r\nspeculation, as noted in your correspondent \"Fair Play's\" excellent\r\nletter,[77] ought to be received by Government, employed by it, not in\r\ncasting guns, but in growing corn and feeding cattle, and the largest\r\npossible legitimate interest returned without risk to these small and\r\nvariously occupied capitalists who cannot look after their own money.\r\nWe should need another kind of Government to do this for us, it is\r\ntrue; also it is true that we can get it, if we choose; but we must\r\nrecognize the duties of governors before we can elect the men fit to\r\nperform them.\r\n\r\nThe benefit of these several modes of right investment of capital\r\nwould be quickly felt by the nation, not in the increase of isolated\r\nor nominal wealth, but in steady lowering of the prices of all the\r\nnecessaries and innocent luxuries of life, and in the disciplined,\r\norderly, and in that degree educational employment of every able-bodied\r\nperson. For, Sir (again with your pardon), my question \"Is England\r\nbig enough?\" was not answered by the sad experience of the artisans\r\nof Poplar. Had they been employed in earth-building instead of in\r\nshipbuilding, and heaped the Isle of Dogs itself into half as much\r\nspace of good land, capable of growing corn instead of mosquitoes,\r\nthey would actually have made habitable England a little bigger by\r\nthis time;[78] and if the first principle of economy in employment\r\nwere understood among us--namely, always to use whatever vital power\r\nof breath and muscle you have got in the country before you use the\r\nartificial power of steam and iron for what living arms can do, and\r\nnever plough by steam while you forward your ploughmen to Quebec--those\r\nold familiar faces need not yet have looked their last at each other\r\nfrom the deck of the St. Lawrence. But on this subject I will ask your\r\npermission to write you in a few days some further words.[79]\r\n\r\n  I am, Sir, your faithful servant,\r\n                                    J. RUSKIN.\r\n\r\nDENMARK HILL, _Aug._ 9.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[74] The _Daily Telegraph_ of Saturday, August 8, contained an article\r\non the \"Increased Railway Fares,\" in which, commenting on Mr. Ruskin's\r\nstatement that, given the law of political economy, the railways might\r\nask as much as they could get, it is said that Mr. Ruskin mistook \"the\r\ncharge against the companies. While they neglected the 'law of supply\r\nand demand,' they suffered: now that they obey that law, they prosper.\"\r\nThe latter part of the article dealt with a long letter signed \"Fair\r\nPlay,\" which was printed in the _Daily Telegraph_ of the same day. \"To\r\nMr. Ruskin, who laughs at Political Economy,\" concluded the article;\r\n\"and to 'Fair Play,' who thinks that Parliament is at the bottom of\r\nall the mischief, we commend a significant fact. An agitation is now\r\non foot in Brighton to have a second railway direct to London. What is\r\nthe cause of this? Not the Legislature, but the conduct of the Brighton\r\ncompany in raising its fares. That board, by acting in the spirit of a\r\nmonopoly, has provoked retaliation, and the public now seeks to protect\r\nitself by the aid of a competing line.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter of the correspondent \"S.\" (also in the _Daily Telegraph_ of\r\nAugust 8) began by asking \"what the capitalist is to do with his money,\r\nif the Government works the railways on the principle of the Post\r\nOffice.\"\r\n\r\n[75] Several of the letters had been written by residents in the\r\nneighborhood of Sydenham.\r\n\r\n[76] B \"Essays on Political Economy\" (_Fraser's Magazine_, June, 1862,\r\np. 784), now reprinted in \"Munera Pulveris,\" p. 1, § 1.\r\n\r\n[77] \"Fair Play's\" letter noted the result of investments made in\r\nbubble railways, generally by \"honest country folks\" or \"poor clergymen\r\nand widows.\"\r\n\r\n[78] A Alluding to an article in the _Daily Telegraph_ of August 8,\r\nheaded \"East-End Emigrants,\" which, after remarking that \"Mr. Ruskin's\r\nquestion, Is England big enough?\" had been just answered rather sadly\r\nby a number of Poplar artisans, described the emigration to Quebec on\r\nboard the St. Lawrence of these inhabitants of the Isle of Dogs, and\r\nhow, as the ship left the dock, \"there were many tears shed, as old,\r\nfamiliar faces looked on each other for the last time.\"\r\n\r\n[79] Never, it seems, written.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From \"The Daily Telegraph,\" December 8, 1865.]\r\n\r\n_OUR RAILWAY SYSTEM._\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of \"The Daily Telegraph.\"_\r\n\r\nSIR: Will you allow me a few words with reference to your excellent\r\narticle of to-day on railroads.[80] All you say is true. But of what\r\nuse is it to tell the public this? Of all the economical stupidities of\r\nthe public--and they are many--the out-and-out stupidest is underpaying\r\ntheir pointsmen; but if the said public choose always to leave their\r\nlines in the hands of companies--that is to say, practically, of\r\nengineers and lawyers--the money they pay for fares will always go,\r\nmost of it, into the engineers' and lawyers' pockets. It will be spent\r\nin decorating railroad stations with black and blue bricks, and in\r\nfighting bills for branch lines. I hear there are more bills for new\r\nlines to be brought forward this year than at any previous session.\r\nBut, Sir, it might do some little good if you were to put it into the\r\nengineers' and lawyers' heads that they might for some time to come get\r\nas much money for themselves (and a little more safety for the public)\r\nby bringing in bills for doubling laterally the present lines as for\r\nramifying them; and if you were also to explain to the shareholders\r\nthat it would be wiser to spend their capital in preventing accidents\r\nattended by costly damages, than in running trains at a loss on\r\nopposition branches. It is little business of mine--for I am not a\r\nrailroad traveller usually more than twice in the year; but I don't\r\nlike to hear of people's being smashed, even when it is all their\r\nfault; so I will ask you merely to reprint this passage from my article\r\non Political Economy in _Fraser's Magazine_ for April, 1863, and so\r\nleave the matter to your handling:\r\n\r\n\"Had the money spent in local mistakes and vain private litigation\r\non the railroads of England been laid out, instead, under proper\r\nGovernment restraint, on really useful railroad work, and had no absurd\r\nexpense been incurred in ornamenting stations, we might already have\r\nhad--what ultimately it will be found we must have--quadruple rails,\r\ntwo for passengers and two for traffic, on every great line, and we\r\nmight have been carried in swift safety, and watched and warded by\r\nwell-paid pointsmen, for half the present fares.\"[81]\r\n\r\n                     I am, Sir, your faithful servant,\r\n                                                       J.

Had the money spent in local mistakes and\r\nvain private litigations on the railroads of England been laid out,\r\ninstead, under proper Government restraint, on really useful railroad\r\nwork, _and had no absurd expense been incurred in ornamenting\r\nstations_, we might already have had--what ultimately it will be found\r\nwe MUST have--_quadruple rails, two for passengers, and two for\r\ntraffic, on every great line_; and we might have been carried in\r\nswift safety, and watched and warded by well-paid pointsmen, for half\r\nthe present fares.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[82] This letter was elicited by a leading article in the _Daily\r\nTelegraph_ of November 29, 1870, upon railway accidents, and the means\r\nof their prevention, _à propos_ of two recent accidents which had\r\noccurred, both on the same day (November 26, 1870) on the London and\r\nNorth-Western Railway.\r\n\r\n[83] In the first letter on the Franco-Prussian War, _ante_, p. 34.\r\n(_Daily Telegraph_, Oct. 7, 1870.)\r\n\r\n                         MISCELLANEOUS LETTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nSERVANTS AND HOUSES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  MASTERSHIP. 1865.\r\n\r\n  EXPERIENCE. 1865.\r\n\r\n  SONSHIP AND SLAVERY. 1865.\r\n\r\n  MODERN HOUSES. 1865.\r\n\r\n                                  II.\r\n\r\n                          SERVANTS AND HOUSES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From \"The Daily Telegraph,\" September 5, 1865.]\r\n\r\n_DOMESTIC SERVANTS--MASTERSHIP._\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of \"The Daily Telegraph.\"_\r\n\r\nSIR: You so seldom write nonsense, that you will, I am sure, pardon\r\nyour friends for telling you when you do. Your article on servants\r\nto-day is nonsense. It is just as easy and as difficult now to get good\r\nservants as it ever was.[84] You may have them, as you may have pines\r\nand peaches, for the growing, or you may even buy them good, if you can\r\npersuade the good growers to spare you them off their walls; but you\r\ncannot get them by political economy and the law of supply and demand.\r\n\r\nThere are broadly two ways of making good servants; the first, a sound,\r\nwholesome, thoroughgoing slavery--which was the heathen way, and no\r\nbad one neither, provided you understand that to make real \"slaves\"\r\nyou must make yourself a real \"master\" (which is not easy). The second\r\nis the Christian's way: \"whoso delicately bringeth up his servant from\r\na child, shall have him become his son at the last.\"[85] And as few\r\npeople want their servants to become their sons, this is not a way\r\nto their liking. So that, neither having courage or self-discipline\r\nenough on the one hand to make themselves nobly dominant after the\r\nheathen fashion, nor tenderness or justice enough to make themselves\r\nnobly protective after the Christian, the present public thinks to\r\nmanufacture servants bodily out of powder and hay-stuffing--mentally\r\nby early instillation of Catechism and other mechanico-religious\r\nappliances--and economically, as you helplessly suggest, by the law of\r\nsupply and demand,[86] with such results as we all see, and most of us\r\nmore or less feel, and shall feel daily more and more to our cost and\r\nselfish sorrow.\r\n\r\nSir, there is only one way to have good servants; that is, to be worthy\r\nof being well served. All nature and all humanity will serve a good\r\nmaster, and rebel against an ignoble one. And there is no surer test\r\nof the quality of a nation than the quality of its servants, for they\r\nare their masters' shadows, and distort their faults in a flattened\r\nmimicry. A wise nation will have philosophers in its servants' hall; a\r\nknavish nation will have knaves there; and a kindly nation will have\r\nfriends there. Only let it be remembered that \"kindness\" means, as with\r\nyour child, so with your servant, not indulgence, but care.--I am, Sir,\r\nseeing that you usually write good sense, and \"serve\" good causes, your\r\nservant to command.\r\n\r\n                                                    J. RUSKIN.[87]\r\n\r\n  DENMARK HILL, _Sept._ 2.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[84] The article, after commenting on \"the good old times,\" remarked\r\nthat it is now \"a social fact, that the hardest thing in the world to\r\nfind is a good servant.\"\r\n\r\n[85] \"He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child, shall\r\nhave him become his son at the length.\"--Proverbs xxix. 21.\r\n\r\n[86] \"We have really,\" ran the article, \"no remedy to suggest: the evil\r\nseems to be curable only by some general distress which will drive more\r\npeople into seeking service, and so give employers a greater choice.\r\nAt present the demand appears to exceed the supply, and servants are\r\ncareless about losing their places through bad behavior.\"\r\n\r\n[87] To this letter the _Daily Telegraph_ of September 6 replied by a\r\nleader, in which, whilst expressing itself alive to \"the sympathy for\r\nhumanity and appreciation of the dignity which may be made to underlie\r\nall human relations,\" displayed by Mr. Ruskin, it complained that he\r\nhad only shown \"how to cook the cook when we catch her,\" and not how\r\nto catch her. After some detailed remarks on the servants of the day,\r\nwhich seemed \"to be more _ad rem_ than Mr. Ruskin's eloquent axioms,\"\r\nit concluded by expressing a hope \"that he would come down from the\r\nclouds of theory, and give to a perplexed public a few plain, workable\r\ninstructions how to get hold of good cooks and maids, coachmen and\r\nfootmen.\"--Mr. Ruskin replies to it, and to a large amount of further\r\ncorrespondence on the subject, in the next two letters in the _Daily\r\nTelegraph_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From \"The Daily Telegraph,\" September 7, 1865.]\r\n\r\n_DOMESTIC SERVANTS--EXPERIENCE._\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of \"The Daily Telegraph.\"_\r\n\r\nSIR: I thank you much for your kind insertion of my letter, and your\r\ncourteous and graceful answer to it. Others will thank you also; for\r\nyour suggestions are indeed much more _ad rem_ than my mere assertions\r\nof principle; but both are necessary. Statements of practical\r\ndifficulty, and the immediate means of conquering it, are precisely\r\nwhat the editor of a powerful daily journal is able to give; but he\r\ncannot give them justly if he ever allow himself to lose sight of the\r\neternal laws which in their imperative bearings manifest themselves\r\nmore clearly to the retired student of human life in the phases of\r\nits history. My own personal experience--if worth anything--has\r\nbeen simply that wherever I myself knew how a thing should be done,\r\nand was resolved to have it done, I could always get subordinates,\r\nif made of average good human material, to do it, and that, on the\r\nwhole, cheerfully, thoroughly, and even affectionately; and my wonder\r\nis usually rather at the quantity of service they are willing to do\r\nfor me, than at their occasional indolences, or fallings below the\r\nstandard of seraphic wisdom and conscientiousness. That they _shall_\r\nbe of average human material, it is, as you wisely point out, every\r\nhouseholder's business to make sure. We cannot choose our relations,\r\nbut we can our servants; and what sagacity we have and knowledge\r\nof human nature cannot be better employed. If your house is to be\r\ncomfortable, your servants' hearts must be sound, as the timber and\r\nstones of its walls; and there must be discretion in the choice,\r\nand time allowed for the \"settling\" of both. The luxury of having\r\npretty servants must be paid for, like all luxuries, in the penalty\r\nof their occasional loss; but I fancy the best sort of female servant\r\nis generally in aspect and general qualities like Sydney Smith's\r\n\"Bunch,\"[88] and a very retainable creature. And for the rest, the\r\ndearth of good service, if such there be, may perhaps wholesomely teach\r\nus that, if we were all a little more in the habit of serving ourselves\r\nin many matters, we should be none the worse or the less happy.\r\n\r\n                             I am, Sir, yours, etc.,\r\n                                                       J. RUSKIN.\r\n\r\n  DENMARK HILL, _Sept._ 6.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[88] \"A man-servant was too expensive; so I caught up a little\r\ngarden-girl, made like a milestone, put a napkin in her hand,\r\nchristened her Bunch, and made her my butler. The girls taught her to\r\nread, Mrs. Sydney to wait, and I undertook her morals; Bunch became the\r\nbest butler in the county.\"--Sydney Smith's Memoirs (vol. i. p. 207),\r\nwhere several other anecdotes of Bunch are given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From \"The Daily Telegraph,\" September 18, 1865.]\r\n\r\n_DOMESTIC SERVANTS: SONSHIP AND SLAVERY._\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of \"The Daily Telegraph.\"_\r\n\r\nSIR: I have been watching the domestic correspondence in your columns\r\nwith much interest, and thought of offering you a short analysis of\r\nit when you saw good to bring it to a close,[89] and perhaps a note\r\nor two of my own experience, being somewhat conceited on the subject\r\njust now, because I have a gardener who lets me keep old-fashioned\r\nplants in the greenhouse, understands that my cherries are grown for\r\nthe blackbirds, and sees me gather a bunch of my own grapes without\r\nmaking a wry face. But your admirable article of yesterday causes\r\nme to abandon my purpose; the more willingly, because among all the\r\nletters you have hitherto published there is not one from any head of\r\na household which contains a complaint worth notice. All the masters\r\nor mistresses whose letters are thoughtful or well written say they\r\nget on well enough with their servants; no part has yet been taken in\r\nthe discussion by the heads of old families. The servants' letters,\r\nhitherto, furnish the best data; but the better class of servants are\r\nalso silent, and must remain so. Launce, Grumio, or Fairservice[90] may\r\nhave something to say for themselves; but you will hear nothing from\r\nOld Adam nor from carefu' Mattie. One proverb from Sancho, if we could\r\nget it, would settle the whole business for us; but his master and he\r\nare indeed \"no more.\" I would have walked down to Dulwich to hear what\r\nSam Weller had to say; but the high-level railway went through Mr.\r\nPickwick's parlor two months ago, and it is of no use writing to Sam,\r\nfor, as you are well aware, he is no penman. And, indeed, Sir, little\r\ngood will come of any writing on the matter. \"The cat will mew, the dog\r\nwill have his day.\" You yourself, excellent as is the greater part of\r\nwhat you have said, and to the point, speak but vainly when you talk of\r\n\"probing the evil to the bottom.\" This is no sore that can be probed,\r\nno sword nor bullet wound. This is a plague spot. Small or great, it is\r\nin the significance of it, not in the depth, that you have to measure\r\nit. It is essentially bottomless, cancerous; a putrescence through\r\nthe constitution of the people is indicated by this galled place.\r\nBecause I know this thoroughly, I say so little, and that little, as\r\nyour correspondents think, who know nothing of me, and as you say,\r\nwho might have known more of me, unpractically. Pardon me, I am no\r\nseller of plasters, nor of ounces of civet. The patient's sickness is\r\nhis own fault, and only years of discipline will work it out of him.\r\nThat is the only really \"practical\" saying that can be uttered to\r\nhim. The relation of master and servant involves every other--touches\r\nevery condition of moral health through the State. Put that right,\r\nand you put all right; but you will find it can only come ultimately,\r\nnot primarily, right; you cannot begin with it. Some of the evidence\r\nyou have got together is valuable, many pieces of partial advice very\r\ngood. You need hardly, I think, unless you wanted a type of British\r\nlogic, have printed a letter in which the writer accused (or would have\r\naccused, if he had possessed Latinity enough) all London servants of\r\nbeing thieves because he had known one robbery to have been committed\r\nby a nice-looking girl.[91] But on the whole there is much common-sense\r\nin the letters; the singular point in them all, to my mind, being the\r\nin-apprehension of the breadth and connection of the question, and the\r\ngeneral resistance to, and stubborn rejection of, the abstract ideas\r\nof sonship and slavery, which include whatever is possible in wise\r\ntreatment of servants. It is very strange to see that, while everybody\r\nshrinks at abstract suggestions of there being possible error in a\r\nbook of Scripture,[92] your sensible English housewife fearlessly\r\nrejects Solomon's opinion when it runs slightly counter to her own,\r\nand that not one of your many correspondents seems ever to have read\r\nthe Epistle to Philemon. It is no less strange that while most English\r\nboys of ordinary position hammer through their Horace at one or other\r\ntime of their school life, no word of his wit or his teaching seems\r\nto remain by them: for all the good they get out of them, the Satires\r\nneed never have been written. The Roman gentleman's account of his\r\nchildhood and of his domestic life possesses no charm for them: and\r\neven men of education would sometimes start to be reminded that his\r\n\"_noctes cænæque Deum_!\" meant supping with his merry slaves on beans\r\nand bacon. Will you allow me, on this general question of liberty and\r\nslavery, to refer your correspondents to a paper of mine touching\r\nclosely upon it, the leader in the _Art-Journal_ for July last? and to\r\nask them also to meditate a little over the two beautiful epitaphs on\r\nEpictetus and Zosima, quoted in the last paper of the _Idler_?[93]\r\n\r\n    \"I, Epictetus, was a slave; and sick in body, and wretched in\r\n    poverty; and beloved by the gods.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Zosima, who while she lived was a slave only in her body, has\r\n    now found deliverance for that also.\"\r\n\r\nHow might we, over many an \"independent\" Englishman, reverse this last\r\nlegend, and write--\r\n\r\n    \"This man, who while he lived was free only in his body, has\r\n    now found captivity for that also.\"\r\n\r\nI will not pass without notice--for it bears also on wide\r\ninterests--your correspondent's question, how my principles differ from\r\nthe ordinary economist's view of supply and demand.[94] Simply in that\r\nthe economy I have taught, in opposition to the popular view, is the\r\nscience which not merely ascertains the relations of existing demand\r\nand supply, but determines what _ought_ to be demanded and what _can_\r\nbe supplied. A child demands the moon, and, the supply not being in\r\nthis case equal to the demand, is wisely accommodated with a rattle; a\r\nfootpad demands your purse, and is supplied according to the less or\r\nmore rational economy of the State, with that or a halter; a foolish\r\nnation, not able to get into its head that free trade does indeed\r\nmean the removal of taxation from its imports, but not of supervision\r\nfrom them, demands unlimited foreign beef, and is supplied with the\r\ncattle murrain and the like. There may be all manner of demands, all\r\nmanner of supplies. The true political economist regulates these; the\r\nfalse political economist leaves them to be regulated by (not Divine)\r\nProvidence. For, indeed, the largest final demand anywhere reported of,\r\nis that of hell; and the supply of it (by the broad-gauge line) would\r\nbe very nearly equal to the demand at this day, unless there were here\r\nand there a swineherd or two who could keep his pigs out of sight of\r\nthe lake.\r\n\r\nThus in this business of servants everything depends on what sort of\r\nservant you at heart wish for or \"demand.\" If for nurses you want\r\nCharlotte Winsors, they are to be had for money; but by no means\r\nfor money, such as that German girl who, the other day, on her own\r\nscarce-floating fragment of wreck, saved the abandoned child of another\r\nwoman, keeping it alive by the moisture from her lips.[95] What kind of\r\nservant do you want? It is a momentous question for you yourself--for\r\nthe nation itself. Are we to be a nation of shopkeepers, wanting only\r\nshop-boys; or of manufacturers, wanting only hands; or are there to be\r\nknights among us, who will need squires--captains among us, needing\r\ncrews? Will you have clansmen for your candlesticks, or silver plate?\r\nMyrmidons at your tents, ant-born, or only a mob on the Gillies Hill?\r\nAre you resolved that you will never have any but your inferiors to\r\nserve you, or shall Enid ever lay your trencher with tender little\r\nthumb, and Cinderella sweep your hearth, and be cherished there? It\r\n_might_ come to that in time, and plate and hearth be the brighter;\r\nbut if your servants are to be held your inferiors, at least be sure\r\nthey _are_ so, and that you are indeed wiser, and better-tempered,\r\nand more useful than they. Determine what their education ought to\r\nbe, and organize proper servants' schools, and there give it them. So\r\nthey will be fit for their position, and will do honor to it, and stay\r\nin it: let the masters be as sure they do honor to theirs, and are as\r\nwilling to stay in that. Remember that every people which gives itself\r\nto the pursuit of riches, invariably, and of necessity, gets the scum\r\nuppermost in time, and is set by the genii, like the ugly bridegroom in\r\nthe Arabian Nights, at its own door with its heels in the air, showing\r\nits shoe-soles instead of a Face. And the reversal is a serious matter,\r\nif reversal be even possible, and it comes right end uppermost again,\r\ninstead of to conclusive Wrong end.\r\n\r\nI suppose I am getting unpractical again. Well, here is one practical\r\nmorsel, and I have done. One or two of your correspondents have spoken\r\nof the facilities of servants for leaving their places. Drive that\r\nnail home, Sir. A large stray branch of the difficulty lies there.\r\nMany and many a time I have heard Mr. Carlyle speak of this, and too\r\noften I have felt it myself as one of the evils closely accompanying\r\nthe fever of modern change in the habits and hopes of life. My own\r\narchitectural work drives me to think of it continually. Round every\r\nrailroad station, out of the once quiet fields, there bursts up first\r\na blotch of brick-fields, and then of ghastly houses, washed over with\r\nslime into miserable fineries of cornice and portico. A gentleman would\r\nhew for himself a log hut, and thresh for himself a straw bed, before\r\nhe would live in such; but the builders count safely on tenants--people\r\nwho know no quietness nor simplicity of pleasure, who care only for the\r\nstucco, and lodge only in the portico, of human life--understanding not\r\nso much as the name of House or House-_Hold_. They and their servants\r\nare always \"bettering themselves\" divergently.\r\n\r\nYou will do good service at least in teaching any of these who will\r\nlisten to you, that if they can once make up their minds to a fixed\r\nstate of life, and a fixed income, and a fixed expenditure--if they can\r\nby any means get their servants to stay long enough with them to fit\r\ninto their places and know the run of the furrows--then something like\r\nservice and mastership, and fulfilment of understood and reciprocal\r\nduty, may become possible; no otherwise. I leave this matter to your\r\nbetter handling, and will trespass on your patience no more. Only, as\r\nI think you will get into some disgrace with your lady correspondents\r\nfor your ungallant conclusions respecting them[96]--which I confess\r\nsurprised me a little, though I might have been prepared for it if I\r\nhad remembered what order the husband even of so good a housewife as\r\nPenelope was obliged to take with some of her female servants after\r\nprolonged absence,--I have translated a short passage of Xenophon's\r\nEconomics[97] for you, which may make your peace if you will print it.\r\nI wish the whole book were well translated; meantime, your lady readers\r\nmust be told that this is part of a Greek country gentleman's account\r\nof the conversation he had with his young wife (a girl of fifteen\r\nonly), a little while after their marriage, when \"she had got used to\r\nhim,\" and was not frightened at being spoken gravely to. First they\r\npray together; and then they have a long happy talk, of which this is\r\nthe close:\r\n\r\n\"But there is one of the duties belonging to you,\" I said, \"which,\r\nperhaps will be more painful to you than any other, namely, the care of\r\nyour servants when they are ill.\" \"Nay,\" answered my wife, \"that will\r\nbe the most pleasing of all my duties to me, if only my servants will\r\nbe grateful when I minister rightly to them, and will love me better.\"\r\nAnd I, pleased with her answer, said, \"Indeed, lady, it is in some such\r\nway as this that the queen of the hive is so regarded by her bees,\r\nthat, if she leave the hive, none will quit her, but all will follow\r\nher.\" Then she answered, \"I should wonder if this office of leader\r\nwere not yours rather than mine, for truly my care and distribution of\r\nthings would be but a jest were it not for your inbringing.\" \"Yes,\" I\r\nsaid, \"but what a jest would my inbringing be if there were no one to\r\ntake care of what I brought. Do not you know how those are pitied of\r\nwhom it is fabled that they have always to pour water into a pierced\r\nvessel?\" \"Yes; and they _are_ unhappy, if in truth they do it,\" said\r\nshe. \"Then also,\" I said, \"remember your other personal cares. Will\r\nall be sweet to you when, taking one of your maidens who knows not\r\nhow to spin, you teach her, and make her twice the girl she was; or\r\none who has no method nor habit of direction, and you teach her how\r\nto manage a house, and make her faithful and mistress-like and every\r\nway worthy, and when you have the power of benefiting those who are\r\norderly and useful in the house, and of punishing any one who is\r\nmanifestly disposed to evil? But what will be sweetest of all, if it\r\nmay come to pass, will be that you should show yourself better even\r\nthan _me_, and so make me your servant also: so that you need not\r\nfear in advancing age to be less honored in my house; but may have\r\nsure hope that in becoming old, by how much more you have become also\r\na noble fellow-worker with me, and joint guardian of our children's\r\npossessions, by so much shall you be more honored in my household. For\r\nwhat is lovely and good increases for all men--not through fairness\r\nof the body, but through strength and virtue in things pertaining to\r\nlife.\" And this is what I remember chiefly of what we said in our first\r\ntalk together.\r\n\r\n                     I am, Sir, your faithful servant,\r\n                                                       J. RUSKIN.\r\n\r\n  DENMARK HILL, _Sept._ 16.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[89] In the \"admirable article\" of September 15, in which the main\r\nfeatures of the voluminous correspondence received by the _Daily\r\nTelegraph_ on the subject were shortly summed up.\r\n\r\n[90] A: Fairservice is mentioned in Mr. Ruskin's discussion of parts\r\nof the \"Antiquary\" in \"Fiction, Fair and Foul\" (_Nineteenth Century_,\r\nJune, 1880) as an \"example of innate evil unaffected by external\r\ninfluences.\"\r\n\r\n[91] This refers to a letter in which the writer gave an account of a\r\nrobbery by a housemaid, and, drawing from her conduct the moral \"put\r\nnot your trust in London servants,\" concluded by signing his letter,\r\n\"Ab _hoc_ disce omnes.\"\r\n\r\n[92] The last volume of Bishop Colenso's work on \"The Pentateuch and\r\nBook of Joshua critically examined\" was published in the April of the\r\nyear in which these letters were written, and his deposition by the\r\nBishop of Capetown had but recently been reversed by the Privy Council.\r\nIt is to the discussion aroused by his book that Mr. Ruskin indirectly\r\nrefers.\r\n\r\n[93] The leader in the _Art-Journal_ is Chapter vi. of \"The Cestus of\r\nAglaia,\" where \"the infinite follies of modern thought, centred in the\r\nnotion that liberty is good for a man, irrespectively of the use he\r\nis likely to make of it,\" are discussed at some length. The epitaphs\r\nquoted are not in the _Idler_ itself, but in the \"Essay on Epitaphs\"\r\nprinted at the end of some editions of it.\r\n\r\n[94] This refers to a letter signed \"W. B.\" in the _Daily Telegraph_ of\r\nSeptember 12.\r\n\r\n[95] Charlotte Winsor was at this time under sentence of death for the\r\nmurder of a child, which had been entrusted to her charge. I have been\r\nunable to verify the anecdote of her heroic anti-type.\r\n\r\n[96] The \"admirable article\" which had closed the discussion advised\r\nmistresses to resemble those of the good old days, and to deserve good\r\nservants, if they wished to secure them. It, somewhat inconsistently\r\nwith the previous articles, declared that the days of good service\r\nwould not be found altogether past, if it was remembered that by\r\nderivation \"domestic\" meant \"homelike,\" and \"family\" one's servants,\r\nnot one's children.\r\n\r\n[97] See \"The Economist of Xenophon,\" since (1875) translated and\r\npublished in the \"Bibliotheca Pastorum,\" edited by Mr. Ruskin (vol. i.\r\np. 50, chap. vii. §§ 37-43). Mr. Ruskin in his preface to the volume\r\nspeaks of the book as containing \"first, a faultless definition of\r\nwealth\" ... \"secondly, the most perfect ideal of kingly character\r\nand kingly government given in literature\" ... and \"thirdly, the\r\nideal of domestic life.\" It may be interesting to note an earlier\r\nand quaint estimate of the work, given in \"Xenophon's Treatise of\r\nHousholde--imprinted at London, in Fleet Street, by T. Berthelet,\r\n1534,\" where the dialogue is described as \"ryght counnyngly translated\r\nout of the Greke tongue into Englysshe by Gentian Hervet at the desyre\r\nof Mayster Geffrey Pole, whiche boke for the welthe of this realme I\r\ndeme very profitable to be red.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From \"The Daily Telegraph,\" October 17, 1865.]\r\n\r\n_MODERN HOUSES._\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of \"The Daily Telegraph.\"_\r\n\r\nSIR: I trust you will hold the very able and interesting letter from\r\n\"W.

Indeed, it has been a discomfort\r\nto me that I have not yet asked the pardon of your correspondent, \"A\r\nTenant, not at will\" (Sept. 21),[99] for the apparent discourtesy of\r\nthought of which he accused me. He need not have done so: for although\r\nI said \"a gentleman would hew for himself a log hut\" rather than live\r\nin modern houses, I never said he would rather abandon his family\r\nand his business than live in them; and your correspondent himself,\r\nin his previously written letter, had used precisely the same words.\r\nAnd he must not suspect that I intend to be ironical in saying that\r\nthe prolonged coincidence of thought and word in the two letters\r\nwell deserves the notice of your readers, in the proof it gives of\r\nthe strength and truth of the impression on both minds. \"W. H. W.'s\"\r\ngraphic description of his house is also sorrowfully faithful to the\r\nfacts of daily experience; and I doubt not that you will soon have\r\nother communications of the same tenor, and all too true.\r\n\r\nI made no attempt to answer \"A Tenant, not at will,\" because the\r\nsubject is much too wide for any detailed treatment in a letter; and\r\nyou do not care for generalizations of mine. But I am sure your two\r\ncorrespondents, and the large class of sufferers which they represent,\r\nwould be very sincerely grateful for some generalizations of yours\r\non this matter. For, Sir, surely of all questions for the political\r\neconomist, this of putting good houses over people's heads is the\r\nclosest and simplest. The first question in all economy, practically as\r\nwell as etymologically, must be this, of lodging. The \"Eco\" must come\r\nbefore the \"Nomy.\" You must have a house before you can put anything\r\ninto it; and preparatorily to laying up treasure, at the least dig a\r\nhole for it. Well, Sir, here, as it seems to my poor thinking, is a\r\nbeautiful and simple problem for you to illustrate the law of demand\r\nand supply upon. Here you have a considerable body of very deserving\r\npersons \"demanding\" a good and cheap article in the way of a house.\r\nWill you or any of your politico-economic correspondents explain to\r\nthem and to me the Divinely Providential law by which, in due course,\r\nthe supply of such cannot but be brought about for them?\r\n\r\nThere is another column in your impression of to-day to which, also, I\r\nwould ask leave to direct your readers' attention--the 4th of the 3d\r\npage; and especially, at the bottom of it, Dr. Whitmore's account of\r\nCrawford Place,[100] and his following statement that it is \"a kind\r\nof property constituting a most profitable investment;\" and I do so\r\nin the hope that you will expand your interpretation of the laws of\r\npolitical economy so far as to teach us how, by their beneficent and\r\ninevitable operation, good houses must finally be provided for the\r\nclasses who live in Crawford Place, and such other places; and, without\r\nnecessity of eviction, also for the colliers of Cramlington (_vide_ 2d\r\ncolumn of the same 3d page).[101] I have, indeed, my own notions on the\r\nsubject, but I do not trouble you with them, for they are unfortunately\r\nbased an that wild notion of there being a \"just\" price for all things,\r\nwhich you say in your article of Oct. 10, on the Sheffield strikes,\r\n\"has no existence but in the minds of theorists.\"[102] The _Pall Mall\r\nGazette_, with which journal I have already held some discussion on the\r\nsubject, eagerly quoted your authority on its side, in its impression\r\nof the same evening; nor do I care to pursue the debate until I can\r\ninform you of the continuous result of some direct results which I am\r\nmaking on my Utopian principles. I have bought a little bit of property\r\nof the Crawford Place description, and mending it somewhat according to\r\nmy notions, I make my tenants pay me what I hold to be a \"just\" price\r\nfor the lodging provided. That lodging I partly look after, partly\r\nteach the tenants to look after for themselves; and I look a little\r\nafter them, as well as after the rents. I do not mean to make a highly\r\nprofitable investment of their poor little rooms; but I do mean to sell\r\na good article, in the way of house room, at a fair price; and hitherto\r\nmy customers are satisfied, and so am I.[103]\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, being entirely busy in other directions, I must\r\nleave the discussion, if it is to proceed at all, wholly between you\r\nand your readers. I will write no word more till I see what they all\r\nhave got to say, and until you yourself have explained to me, in its\r\nanticipated results, the working--as regards the keeping out of winter\r\nand rough weather--of the principles of Non-iquity (I presume that\r\nis the proper politico-economic form for the old and exploded word\r\nIniquity); and so I remain, Sir, yours, etc.,\r\n\r\n                                                       J. RUSKIN.\r\n\r\n  DENMARK HILL, _Oct._ 16.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[98] The letter of \"W. H. W.\" commenced by stating that the writer had\r\n\"waited till the discussion ... about domestic servants was brought\r\nto a close to make a few remarks on a subject touched on in Mr.\r\nRuskin's last letter--domestic architecture.\" It then gave a \"graphic\r\ndescription\" of \"W. H. W.'s\" own modern villa and its miseries, and\r\nconcluded by asking Mr. Ruskin if nothing could be done!\r\n\r\n[99] \"A Tenant, not at will\" had written to point out the coincidence\r\nthat he had, before the publication of Mr. Ruskin's third letter,\r\nhimself begun a letter to the _Daily Telegraph_ on the subject of\r\nhouses, in parts of which, strangely enough, he had used expressions\r\nvery similar to those of Mr. Ruskin (see _ante_, pp. 147-8). He\r\nhad described his modern suburban villa as \"one of an ugly mass of\r\nblossoms lately burst forth from the parent trunk--a brickfield;\" and\r\ndeclared that if it were not that people would think him mad, he \"would\r\ninfinitely rather live in a log hut of his own building\" than in a\r\nbuilder's villa. He concluded by saying that all the houses were the\r\nsame, and that therefore, until Mr. Ruskin could point out honest-built\r\ndwellings neglected while the \"villas\" were all let, it was not quite\r\nfair of him to assume that \"suburban villains\" utterly wanted the true\r\ninstinct of gentlemen which would lead to the preference of log huts to\r\nplaster palaces.\r\n\r\n[100] The account consisted of a report presented by Dr. Whitmore,\r\nas Metropolitan Officer of Health to the district, to the Marylebone\r\nRepresentative Council. Describing the miseries of Crawford Place,\r\nwhich was left in an untenantable condition, while the landlords still\r\ngot high rents for it, he added that \"property of this description, let\r\nout in separate rooms to weekly tenants, constitutes a most profitable\r\ninvestment,\" according to the degree of flinty determination exercised\r\nin collecting the rents.\r\n\r\n[101] This alludes to an account of the position of the Cramlington\r\ncolliers after seventeen days of strike. The masters attempted to evict\r\nthe pitmen from their houses, an attempt which the pitmen met partly by\r\nserious riot and resistance, and partly by destroying the houses they\r\nwere forced to leave.\r\n\r\n[102] \"Such a thing as a 'just price,' either for labor or for any\r\nother commodity, has, with all submission to Mr. Ruskin, no existence\r\nsave in the minds of theorists.\" (_Daily Telegraph_, Oct. 10, quoted\r\nby the _Pall Mall_ in its \"Epitome of the Morning Papers\" on the same\r\nday.) The discussion with the _Gazette_ consisted of the \"Work and\r\nWages\" letters (see _ante_, pp. 72 _seqq._).\r\n\r\n[103] See \"Fors Clavigera,\" 1877, Letter 78, Notes and Correspondence,\r\np. 170.\r\n\r\n                         MISCELLANEOUS LETTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nROMAN INUNDATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A KING'S FIRST DUTY. 1871.\r\n\r\n  A NATION'S DEFENCES. 1871.\r\n\r\n  THE WATERS OF COMFORT. 1871.\r\n\r\n  THE STREAMS OF ITALY. 1871.\r\n\r\n  THE STREETS OF LONDON. 1871.\r\n\r\n                                  III.\r\n\r\n                           ROMAN INUNDATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From \"The Daily Telegraph,\" January 12, 1871. Also reprinted in \"Fors\r\nClavigera,\" 1873, Letter 33, p. 23.]\r\n\r\n_A KING'S FIRST DUTY._\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of \"The Daily Telegraph.\"_\r\n\r\nSIR: May I ask you to add to your article on the inundation of the\r\nTiber some momentary invitation to your readers to think with Horace\r\nrather than to smile with him?\r\n\r\nIn the briefest and proudest words he wrote of himself he thought of\r\nhis native land chiefly as divided into the two districts of violent\r\nand scanty waters:\r\n\r\n    \"Dicar, qua violens obstrepit Aufidus,\r\n    Et qua, pauper aquæ, Daunus agrestium\r\n    Regnavit populorum.\"[104]\r\n\r\nNow the anger and power of that \"tauriformis Aufidus\" is precisely\r\nbecause \"regna Dauni præfluit\"--because it flows past the poor kingdoms\r\nwhich it should enrich. Stay it there, and it is treasure instead of\r\nruin. And so also with Tiber and Eridanus. They are so much gold,\r\nat their sources--they are so much death, if they once break down\r\nunbridled into the plains.\r\n\r\nAt the end of your report of the events of the inundation, it is said\r\nthat the King of Italy expressed \"an earnest desire to do something,\r\nas far as science and industry could effect it, to prevent or mitigate\r\ninundations for the future.\"\r\n\r\nNow science and industry can do, not \"something,\" but everything, and\r\nnot merely to mitigate inundations--and, deadliest of inundations,\r\nbecause perpetual, maremmas--but to change them into national banks\r\ninstead of debts.\r\n\r\nThe first thing the King of any country has to do is to manage the\r\nstreams of it.\r\n\r\nIf he can manage the streams, he can also the people; for the people\r\nalso form alternately torrent and maremma, in pestilential fury or\r\npestilential idleness. They also will change into living streams of\r\nmen, if their Kings literally \"lead them forth beside the waters of\r\ncomfort.\" Half the money lost by this inundation of Tiber, spent\r\nrightly on the hill-sides last summer, would have changed every wave\r\nof it into so much fruit and foliage in spring where now there will be\r\nonly burning rock. And the men who have been killed within the last two\r\nmonths, and whose work, and the money spent in doing it, have filled\r\nEurope with misery which fifty years will not efface,[105] they had\r\nbeen set at the same cost to do good instead of evil, and to save life\r\ninstead of destroying it, might, by this 10th of January, 1871, have\r\nembanked every dangerous stream at the roots of the Rhine, the Rhone,\r\nand the Po, and left to Germany, to France, and to Italy an inheritance\r\nof blessing for centuries to come--they and their families living all\r\nthe while in brightest happiness and peace. And now! Let the Red Prince\r\nlook to it; red inundation bears also its fruit in time.\r\n\r\n                     I am, Sir, your obedient servant,\r\n                                                     JOHN RUSKIN.\r\n\r\n  _Jan._ 10.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[104] On December 27 there was a disastrous inundation of the Tiber,\r\nand a great part of Rome was flooded. The _Daily Telegraph_ in its\r\nleading article of Jan. 10, 1871, on the subject, began by quoting from\r\nthe \"very neatest,\" \"sparkling,\" \"light-hearted\" ode of Horace, \"Jam\r\nsatis terris nivis\" (Horace, Odes, i. 2). The quotations in the letter\r\nare from Odes iv. 14, 25, and from the celebrated ode beginning \"Exegi\r\nmonumentum œre perennius\" (Odes, iii. 30).\r\n\r\n[105] This letter, it will be noticed, was written during the\r\nbombardment of Paris in the Franco-Prussian war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From \"The Pall Mall Gazette,\" January 19, 1871.]\r\n\r\n_A NATION'S DEFENCES._\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of \"The Pall Mall Gazette.\"_\r\n\r\nSIR: The letter to which you do me the honor to refer, in your\r\nyesterday's article on the Tiber, entered into no detail,[106] because\r\nI had already laid the plans spoken of before the Royal Institution\r\nin my lecture there last February;[107] in which my principal object\r\nwas to state the causes of the incalculably destructive inundations\r\nof the Rhone, Toccia, and Ticino, in 1868; and to point out that no\r\nmountain river ever was or can be successfully embanked in the valleys;\r\nbut that the rainfall must be arrested on the high and softly rounded\r\nhill surfaces, before it reaches any ravine in which its force can be\r\nconcentrated. Every mountain farm ought to have a dike about two feet\r\nhigh--with a small ditch within it--carried at intervals in regular,\r\nscarcely perceptible incline across its fields; with discharge into\r\na reservoir large enough to contain a week's maximum rainfall on the\r\narea of that farm in the stormiest weather-the higher uncultivated\r\nland being guarded over larger spaces with bolder embankments. No\r\ndrop of water that had once touched hill ground ought ever to reach\r\nthe plains till it was wanted there: and the maintenance of the bank\r\nand reservoir, once built, on any farm, would not cost more than the\r\nkeeping up of its cattle-sheds against chance of whirlwind and snow.\r\n\r\nThe first construction of the work would be costly enough; and, say the\r\nEconomists, \"would not pay.\" I never heard of any National Defences\r\nthat did! Presumably, we shall have to pay more income-tax next year,\r\nwithout hope of any dividend on the disbursement. Nay--you must usually\r\nwait a year or two before you get paid for any great work, even when\r\nthe gain is secure. The fortifications of Paris did not pay, till very\r\nlately; they are doubtless returning cent. per cent. now, since the\r\nkind of rain falls heavy within them which they were meant to catch.\r\nOur experimental embankments against (perhaps too economically cheap)\r\nshot at Shoeburyness are property which we can only safely \"realize\"\r\nunder similarly favorable conditions. But my low embankments would not\r\ndepend for their utility on the advent of a hypothetical foe, but would\r\nhave to contend with an instant and inevitable one; yet with one who\r\nis only an adversary if unresisted; who, resisted, becomes a faithful\r\nfriend--a lavish benefactor.\r\n\r\nGive me the old bayonets in the Tower, if I can't have anything so\r\ngood as spades; and a few regiments of \"volunteers\" with good Engineer\r\nofficers over them, and, in three years' time, an Inundation of Tiber,\r\nat least, shall be Impossible.\r\n\r\n                     I am, Sir, your faithful servant,\r\n                                                     JOHN RUSKIN.\r\n\r\n  DENMARK HILL, _Jan._ 19, 1871.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[106] The _Pall Mall Gazette_ had quoted part of the preceding letter,\r\nand had spoken of \"a remedy which Mr. Ruskin himself appears to\r\ncontemplate, though he describes it in rather a nebulous manner.\"\r\n\r\n[107] \"A Talk respecting Verona and its Rivers,\" February 4, 1870. (See\r\nProceedings of the Royal Institution, vol. vi. p. 55. The report of the\r\nlecture was also printed by the Institution in a separate form; pp.\r\n7.) The lecture concluded thus: \"Further, without in the least urging\r\nmy plans impatiently on any one else, I know thoroughly that this [the\r\nprotection against inundations] which I have said _should_ be done,\r\n_can_ be done, for the Italian rivers, and that no method of employment\r\nof our idle able-bodied laborers would be in the end more remunerative,\r\nor in the beginnings of it more healthful and every way beneficial\r\nthan, with the concurrence of the Italian and Swiss governments,\r\nsetting them to redeem the valleys of the Ticino and the Rhone. And\r\nI pray you to think of this; for I tell you truly--you who care for\r\nItaly--that both her passions and her mountain streams are noble; but\r\nthat her happiness depends not on the liberty, but the right government\r\nof both.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From \"The Daily Telegraph,\" February 4, 1871.]\r\n\r\n_THE WATERS OF COMFORT._\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of \"The Daily Telegraph.\"_\r\n\r\nSIR: I did not see your impression of yesterday until too late to reply\r\nto the question of your correspondent in Rome;[108] and I am hurried\r\nto-day; but will send you to-morrow a precise statement of what I\r\nbelieve can be done in the Italian uplands. The simplest and surest\r\nbeginning would be the purchase, either by the Government or by a small\r\ncompany formed in Rome, of a few plots of highland in the Apennines,\r\nnow barren for want of water, and valueless; and the showing what\r\ncould be made of them by terraced irrigation such as English officers\r\nhave already introduced in many parts of India. The Agricultural\r\nCollege at Cirencester ought, I think, to be able to send out two or\r\nthree superintendents, who would direct rightly the first processes\r\nof cultivation, choosing for purchase good soil in good exposures,\r\nand which would need only irrigation to become fruitful; and by next\r\nsummer, if not by the end of this, there would be growing food for men\r\nand cattle where now there is only hot dust; and I do not think there\r\nwould be much further question \"where the money was to come from.\" The\r\nreal question is only, \"Will you _pay_ your money in advance for what\r\nis actually new land added to the kingdom of living Italy?\" or \"Will\r\nyou pay it under call from the Tiber every ten or twenty years as the\r\nprice of the work done by the river for your destruction?\"\r\n\r\n                     I am, Sir, your faithful servant,\r\n                                                       J. RUSKIN.\r\n\r\n  OXFORD, _Feb._ 3.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[108] The correspondent of the _Daily Telegraph_ had written that Mr.\r\nRuskin's letter of January 10 had been translated into Italian and had\r\nset people thinking, and he asked Mr. Ruskin to write and state the\r\ncase once more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From \"The Daily Telegraph,\" February 7, 1871.]\r\n\r\n_THE STREAMS OF ITALY._[109]\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of \"The Daily Telegraph.\"_\r\n\r\nSIR: In this month, just thirty years ago, I was at Naples, and the\r\ndays were nearly as dark as these, but with clouds and rain, not fog.\r\nThe streets leading down from St. Elmo became beds of torrents. A\r\nstory went about--true or not I do not know, but credible enough--of\r\na child's having been carried off by the gutter and drowned at the\r\nbottom of the hill. At last came indeed what, in those simple times,\r\npeople thought a serious loss of life. A heavy storm burst one night\r\nabove a village on the flank of the Monte St. Angelo, a mile or two\r\nsouth of Pompeii. The limestones slope steeply there under about three\r\nfeet of block earth. The water peeled a piece of the rock of its earth,\r\nas one would peel an orange, and brought down three or four acres of\r\nthe good soil in a heap on the village at midnight, driving in the\r\nupper walls, and briefly burying some fourteen or fifteen people in\r\ntheir sleep--and, as I say, in those times there was some talk even\r\nabout fourteen or fifteen. But the same kind of thing takes place, of\r\ncourse, more or less, among the hills in almost every violent storm,\r\ngenerally with the double result of ruining more ground below than is\r\nremoved from the rocks above; for the frantic streams mostly finish\r\ntheir work with a heap of gravel and blocks of stone like that which\r\ncame down the ravine below the glacier of Greppond about ten years ago,\r\nand destroyed, for at least fifty years to come, some of quite the best\r\nland in Chamouni.\r\n\r\nIn slower, but ceaseless process of ruin, the Po, Arno, and Tiber\r\nsteadily remove the soil from the hills, and carry it down to their\r\ndeltas. The Venetians have contended now for a thousand years in vain\r\neven with the Brenta and the minor streams that enter their lagoons,\r\nand have only kept their canals clear by turning the river south to\r\nMalamocco with embankments which have unhealthily checked the drainage\r\nof all the flat country about Padua.\r\n\r\nAnd this constant mischief takes place, be it observed, irrespective\r\nof inundation. All that Florence, Pisa, and Rome have suffered and\r\nsuffer periodically from floods is so much mischief added to that of\r\nincreasing maremmas, spoiled harborages, and lost mountain-ground.\r\n\r\nThere is yet one further evil. The snow on the bared rock slips lower\r\nand melts faster; snow, which in mossy or grass ground would have\r\nlain long, and furnished steadily flowing streams far on into summer,\r\nfall or melt from the bare rock in avalanche and flood, and spend in\r\ndesolation in a few days what would have been nourishment for half the\r\nyear. And against all this there are no remedies possible in any sudden\r\nor external action. It is the law of the Heaven which sends flood\r\nand food, that national prosperity can only be achieved by national\r\nforethought and unity of purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1858 I was staying the greater part of the summer at\r\nBellinzona, during a drought as harmful as the storms of ten years\r\nlater. The Ticino sank into a green rivulet; and not having seen the\r\nright way to deal with the matter, I had many a talk with the parroco\r\nof a little church whose tower I was drawing, as to the possibility of\r\nsetting his peasants to work to repair the embankment while the river\r\nwas low. But the good old priest said, sorrowfully, the peasants were\r\ntoo jealous of each other, that no one would build anything or protect\r\nhis own ground for fear his work might also benefit his neighbors.\r\n\r\nBut the people of Bellinzona are Swiss, not Italians. I believe the\r\nRoman and Sienese races, in different ways, possess qualities of\r\nstrength and gentleness far more precious than the sunshine and rain\r\nupon their mountains, and, hitherto, as cruelly lost. It is in them\r\nthat all the real power of Italy still lives; it is only by them, and\r\nby what care, and providence, and accordant good-will ever be found in\r\nthem, that the work is to be done, not by money; though, if money were\r\nall that is needed, do we in England owe so little to Italy of delight\r\nthat we cannot so much as lend her spades and pick-axes at her need?\r\nWould she trust us? Would her government let us send over some engineer\r\nofficers and a few sappers and miners, and bear, for a time, with an\r\nEnglish instead of a French \"occupation\" of her barrenest hills?\r\n\r\nBut she does not need us. Good engineers she has, and has had many\r\nsince Leonardo designed the canals of Lombardy. Agriculturists she has\r\nhad, I think, among her gentlemen a little before there were gentlemen\r\nfarmers in England; something she has told us of agriculture, also,\r\npleasantly by the reeds of Mincio and among the apple-blossoms wet with\r\nArno. Her streams have learned obedience before now: Fonte Branda and\r\nthe Fountain of Joy flow at Sienna still; the rivulets that make green\r\nthe slopes of Casentino may yet satisfy true men's thirst. \"Where is\r\nthe money to come from?\" Let Italy keep her souls pure, and she will\r\nnot need to alloy her florins. The only question for her is whether\r\nstill the mossy rock and the \"rivus aquæ\" are \"in rotis\" or rather the\r\nracecourse and the boulevard--the curses of England and of France.\r\n\r\nAt all events, if any one of the Princes of Rome will lead, help enough\r\nwill follow to set the work on foot, and show the peasants, in some\r\nnarrow district, what can be done. Take any arid piece of Apennine\r\ntowards the sources of the Tiber; let the drainage be carried along the\r\nhill-sides away from the existing water-courses; let cisterns, as of\r\nold in Palestine, and larger reservoirs, such as we now can build, be\r\nestablished at every point convenient for arrest of the streams; let\r\nchannels of regulated flow be established from these over the tracts\r\nthat are driest in summer; let ramparts be carried, not along the\r\nriver banks, but round the heads of the ravines, throwing the water\r\naside into lateral canals; then terrace and support the looser soil\r\non all the steeper slopes; and the entire mountain side may be made\r\none garden of orange and vine and olive beneath; and a wide blossoming\r\norchard above; and a green highest pasture for cattle, and flowers for\r\nbees--up to the edge of the snows of spring.\r\n\r\n                     I am, Sir, your faithful servant,\r\n                                                     JOHN RUSKIN.\r\n\r\n  OXFORD, _Feb._ 3.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[109] See the date of the letter on a landslip near Giagnano (vol. i.\r\np. 302).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From \"The Pall Mall Gazette,\" December 28, 1871.]\r\n\r\n_THE STREETS OF LONDON._\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of \"The Pall Mall Gazette.\"_\r\n\r\nSIR: I have been every day on the point of writing to you since your\r\nnotice, on the 18th,[110] of the dirty state of the London streets, to\r\nask whether any of your readers would care to know how such matters\r\nare managed in my neighborhood. I was obliged, a few years ago, for\r\nthe benefit of my health, to take a small house in one of the country\r\ntowns of Utopia; and though I was at first disappointed in the climate,\r\nwhich indeed is no better than our own (except that there is no foul\r\nmarsh air), I found my cheerfulness and ability for work greatly\r\nincreased by the mere power of getting exercise pleasantly close to my\r\ndoor, even in the worst of the winter, when, though I have a little\r\ngarden at the back of my house, I dislike going into it, because the\r\nthings look all so dead; and find my walk on the whole pleasanter in\r\nthe streets, these being always perfectly clean, and the wood-carving\r\nof the houses prettier than much of our indoor furniture. But it was\r\nabout the streets I wanted to tell you. The Utopians have the oddest\r\nway of carrying out things, when once they begin, as far as they can\r\ngo; and it occurred to them one dirty December long since, when they,\r\nlike us, had only crossing-sweepers, that they might just as well sweep\r\nthe whole of the street as the crossings of it, so that they might\r\ncross anywhere. Of course that meant more work for the sweepers; but\r\nthe Utopians have always hands enough for whatever work is to be done\r\nin the open air;--they appointed a due number of brooms-men to every\r\nquarter of the town; and since then, at any time of the year, it is in\r\nour little town as in great Rotterdam when Doctor Brown saw it on his\r\njourney from Norwich to Colen in 1668, \"the women go about in white\r\nslippers,\" which is pretty to see.[111] Now, Sir, it would, of course,\r\nbe more difficult to manage anything like this in London, because, for\r\none thing, in our town we have a rivulet running down every street that\r\nslopes to the river; and besides, because you have coal-dust and smoke\r\nand what not to deal with; and the habit of spitting, which is worst\r\nof all--in Utopia, a man would as soon vomit as spit in the street (or\r\nanywhere else, indeed, if he could help it). But still it is certain we\r\ncan at least anywhere do as much for the whole street, as we have done\r\nfor the crossing; and to show that we can, I mean, on 1st January next,\r\nto take three street-sweepers into constant service; they will be the\r\nfirst workpeople I employ with the interest of the St. George's fund,\r\nof which I shall get my first dividend this January; and, whenever I\r\ncan get leave from the police and inhabitants, I will keep my three\r\nsweepers steadily at work for eight hours a day; and I hope soon to\r\nshow you a bit of our London streets kept as clean as the deck of a\r\nship of the line.[112]\r\n\r\n                     I am, Sir, your faithful servant,\r\n                                                     JOHN RUSKIN.\r\n\r\n  _December_ 27, 1871.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[110] Quite unimportant.

You know, Sir, as you have shown by\r\nyour comments on the Bishop of Oxford's last speech on this subject,\r\nand you could not at present use your influence more beneficially than\r\nby farther showing that the real education-the education which alone\r\nshould be compulsory--means nothing of the kind.

All these characters\r\ncan be taught, and cannot be acquired by sickly and ill-dispositioned\r\nchildren without being taught; but they can be untaught to any extent,\r\nby evil habit and example at home. Public schools, in which the aim\r\nwas to form character faithfully, would return to them in due time to\r\ntheir parents, worth more than their \"weight in gold.\" That is the\r\nreal answer to the objections founded on economical difficulties.

Everybody\r\nwants to _hear_--nobody to read--nobody to think; to be excited for\r\nan hour--and, if possible, amused; to get the knowledge it has cost a\r\nman half his life to gather, first sweetened up to make it palatable,\r\nand then kneaded into the smallest possible pills--and to swallow it\r\nhomœopathically and be wise--this is the passionate desire and hope of\r\nthe multitude of the day.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be done. A living comment quietly given to a class\r\non a book they are earnestly reading--this kind of lecture is\r\neternally necessary and wholesome; your modern fire-working,\r\nsmooth-downy-curry-and-strawberry-ice-and-milk-punch-altogether lecture\r\nis an entirely pestilent and abominable vanity; and the miserable death\r\nof poor Dickens, when he might have been writing blessed books till he\r\nwas eighty, but for the pestiferous demand of the mob, is a very solemn\r\nwarning to us all, if we would take it.[115]\r\n\r\nGod willing, I will go on writing, and as well as I can.

More pain is caused to the draught-horses of London\r\nin an hour by avariciously overloading them, than to all the foxes in\r\nEngland by the hunts of the year: and the rending of body and heart in\r\nhuman death, caused by neglect, in our country cottages, in any one\r\nwinter, could not be equalled by the death-pangs of any quantity of\r\nfoxes.\r\n\r\nThe real evils of fox-hunting are that it wastes the time, misapplies\r\nthe energy, exhausts the wealth, narrows the capacity, debases the\r\ntaste, and abates the honor of the upper classes of this country;\r\nand instead of keeping, as your correspondent \"Forester\" supposes,\r\n\"thousands from the workhouse,\" it sends thousands of the poor, both\r\nthere, and into the grave.\r\n\r\nThe athletic training given by fox-hunting is excellent; and such\r\ntraining is vitally necessary to the upper classes. But it ought always\r\nto be in real service to their country; in personal agricultural labor\r\nat the head of their tenantry; and in extending English life and\r\ndominion in waste regions, against the adverse powers of nature. Let\r\nthem become Captains of Emigration;--hunt down the foxes that spoil the\r\nVineyard of the World; and keep their eyes on the leading hound, in\r\nPacks of Men.\r\n\r\n                     I am, Sir, your faithful servant,\r\n                                                    J. RUSKIN.[121]\r\n\r\n  DENMARK HILL, _Jan._ 14.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[119] In various parts of \"Modern Painters.\" See vol. v. p. 264. \"I\r\nwish, however, the reader distinctly to understand that the expressions\r\nof reprobation of field-sports which he will find scattered through\r\nthese volumes ... refer only to the chase and the turf; that is to say,\r\nto hunting, shooting, and horse-racing, but not to athletic exercises.\r\nI have just as deep a respect for boxing, wrestling, cricketing,\r\nand rowing, as contempt of all the various modes of wasting wealth,\r\ntime, land, and energy of soul, which have been invented by the pride\r\nand selfishness of men, in order to enable them to be healthy in\r\nuselessness, and get quit of the burdens of their own lives, without\r\ncondescending to make themselves serviceable to others.\"\r\n\r\n[120] The correspondence originated as follows: In the _Fortnightly\r\nReview_ of October, 1869, appeared an article against fox-hunting\r\nby Mr. E. A. Freeman, entitled, \"The Morality of Field Sports,\" to\r\nwhich Mr. Anthony Trollope replied by one entitled \"The Morality of\r\nHunting,\" in the _Fortnightly_ of the following December. Mr. Freeman\r\nthen rejoined by two letters of considerable length, addressed to\r\nthe editor of the _Daily Telegraph_ (December 18 and 29), in whose\r\ncolumns some discussion of the matter had already been carried on,\r\nwhilst one of its leaders had strongly supported Mr. Freeman's views.\r\nOther correspondence on the subject was still appearing in the _Daily\r\nTelegraph_ from day to day at the time Mr. Ruskin wrote the present\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n[121] At the annual meeting of the Society for the Prevention of\r\nCruelty to Animals, Mr. Ruskin is reported (_Daily News_, July 11,\r\n1877) to have said that \"as he was somewhat concerned in the studies\r\nof the scientific world, it might be thought that he sympathized in\r\nthe resistance offered, not without some ground of reason, to some of\r\nthe more enthusiastic and, he feared in some respects, exaggerated\r\nand sentimental actions of the society. He pleaded in the name of\r\npoor animals that none of them should act too much on the feeling of\r\npity, or without making a thoroughly judicial inquiry. In looking at\r\nthe report, he found part of the society's admirable evidence mixed\r\nup with sentimental tales of fiction and other means of exciting mere\r\nemotion, which had caused them to lose power with those who had the\r\ngreatest influence in the prevention of the abuses which the society\r\ndesired to check. The true justice of their cause lay in the relations\r\nwhich men had had with animals from the time when both were made. They\r\nhad endeavored to prevent cruelty to animals; they had not enough\r\nendeavored to promote affection for animals. He thought they had had\r\ntoo much to do in the police courts, and not enough in the field\r\nand the cottage garden. As one who was especially interested in the\r\neducation of the poor, he believed that he could not educate them on\r\nanimals, but that he could educate them by animals. He trusted to the\r\npets of children for their education just as much as to their tutors.\r\nHe rejoiced in the separate organization of the Ladies' Committee,\r\nand looked to it to give full extent and power to action which\r\nwould supersede all their expensive and painful disputable duties.\r\nWithout perfect sympathy with the animals around them, no gentleman's\r\neducation, no Christian education, could be of any possible use. In\r\nconcluding, he pleaded for an expansion of the protection extended by\r\nthe society to wild birds.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From \"The Daily Telegraph,\" December 11, 1871.]\r\n\r\n_DRUNKENNESS AND CRIME._\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of \"The Daily Telegraph.\"_\r\n\r\nSIR: I am greatly surprised by the slightness of your article to-day on\r\nthe statistics of drunkenness and the relative statistics of crime.[122]\r\n\r\nThe tables you have given, if given only in that form by Professor\r\nLeone Levi, are anything but \"instructive.\" Liquor is not, for such\r\npurpose, to be measured only by the gallon, but by the gallon with\r\naccompanying statement of strength.\r\n\r\nCrime is not for such purpose to be measured by the number of\r\ncriminals, but by the number, with accompanying statement of the crime\r\ncommitted. Drunkenness very slightly encourages theft, very largely\r\nencourages murder, and universally encourages idleness, which is not a\r\ncrime apparent in a tabular form. But, whatever results might, even by\r\nsuch more accurate statement, be attainable, are not material to the\r\nquestion at issue. Drunkenness is not the _cause_ of crime in any case.\r\nIt _is_ itself crime in every case. A gentleman will not knock out his\r\nwife's brains when he is drunk; but it is nevertheless his duty to\r\nremain sober.\r\n\r\nMuch more is it his duty to teach his peasantry to remain sober, and to\r\nfurnish them with sojourn more pleasant than the pothouse, and means\r\nof amusement less circumscribed than the pot. And the encouragement of\r\ndrunkenness, for the sake of the profit on sale of drink, is certainly\r\none of the most criminal methods of assassination for money hitherto\r\nadopted by the bravos of an age or country.\r\n\r\n                     I am, Sir, your faithful servant,\r\n                                                     JOHN RUSKIN.\r\n\r\n  DENMARK HILL, _Dec._ 9.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[122] A short leader to which special reference is unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From \"The Pall Mall Gazette,\" November 4, 1872.

Who ever talked, or thought, of regarding criminals \"simply\" as\r\nanything (or innocent people either, if there be any)?

No almsgiving of money is so helpful as almsgiving of\r\ncare and thought; the giving of money without thought is indeed\r\ncontinually mischievous; but the invective of the economist against\r\n_in_discriminate charity is idle, if it be not coupled with pleading\r\nfor discriminate charity, and, above all, for that charity which\r\ndiscerns the uses that people may be put to, and helps them by setting\r\nthem to work in those services. That is the help beyond all others,\r\nfind out how to make useless people useful, and let them earn their\r\nmoney instead of begging it.

(Pp. 15, including the title-page.\r\nPrinted by Strangeways & Walden, Castle Street, Leicester Square.)[126]]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first great fact on which all wise and enduring legislation\r\nrespecting labor must be founded, is, that the character of men depends\r\nmore on their occupations than on any teaching we can give them, or\r\nprinciples with which we can imbue them.\r\n\r\nThe employment forms the habits of body and mind, and these are the\r\nconstitution of the man--the greater part of his moral or persistent\r\nnature, whatever effort, under special excitement, he may make to\r\nchange or overcome them. Employment is the half, and the primal half,\r\nof education--it is the warp of it; and the fineness or the endurance\r\nof all subsequently woven pattern depends wholly on its straightness\r\nand strength. And whatever difficulty there may be in tracing through\r\npast history the remoter connections of event and cause, one chain\r\nof sequence is always clear: the formation, namely, of the character\r\nof nations by their employments, and the determination of their\r\nfinal fate by their character. The moment and the first direction of\r\ncircumstances, of decisive revolutions, often depend on accident; but\r\ntheir persistent course, and their consequences, depend wholly on\r\nthe nature of the people. The passing of the Reform Bill by the late\r\nEnglish Parliament[127] may have been more or less accidental: the\r\nresults of the measure now rest on the character of the English people,\r\nas it has been developed by their recent interests, occupations, and\r\nhabits of life. Whether as a body, they employ their new powers for\r\ngood or evil will depend not on their facilities for knowledge, nor\r\neven on the general intelligence they may possess, but on the number of\r\npersons among them whom wholesome employments have rendered familiar\r\nwith the duties, and temperate in their estimate of the promises of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nBut especially in passing laws respecting the treatment or employment\r\nof improvident and more or less vicious persons it is to be remembered\r\nthat as men are not to be made heroes by an act of heroism, but must be\r\nbrave before they can perform it, so they are not made villains by the\r\ncommission of a crime, but were villains before they committed it; and\r\nthat the right of public interference with their conduct begins when\r\nthey begin to corrupt themselves, not merely at the moment when they\r\nhave proved themselves hopelessly corrupt.\r\n\r\nAll measures of reformation are effective in exact proportion to their\r\ntimeliness: partial decay may be cut away and cleansed; incipient\r\nerror corrected; but there is a point at which corruption can no more\r\nbe stayed, nor wandering recalled; it has been the manner of modern\r\nphilanthropy to remain passive until that precise period, and to leave\r\nthe rich to perish and the foolish to stray, while it exhausted itself\r\nin frantic exertions to raise the dead and reform the dust.\r\n\r\nThe recent direction of a great weight of public opinion against\r\ncapital punishment is, I think, the sign of an awakening perception\r\nthat punishment is the last and worst instrument in the hands of the\r\nlegislature for the prevention of crime.\r\n\r\nThe true instruments of reformation are employment and reward--not\r\npunishment. Aid the willing, honor the virtuous, and compel the idle\r\ninto occupation, and there will be no need for the compelling of any\r\ninto the great and last indolence of death. The beginning of all true\r\nreformation among the criminal classes depends on the establishment\r\nof institutions for their active employment, while their criminality\r\nis still unripe, and their feelings of self-respect, capacities\r\nof affection, and sense of justice not altogether quenched. That\r\nthose who are desirous of employment should be always able to find\r\nit, will hardly, at the present day, be disputed; but that those\r\nwho are undesirous of employment should of all persons be the most\r\nstrictly compelled to it, the public are hardly yet convinced. If\r\nthe damage of the principal thoroughfares in their capital city, and\r\nthe multiplication of crimes more ghastly than ever yet disgraced a\r\nnominal civilization, do not convince them, they will not have to wait\r\nlong before they receive sterner lessons. For our neglect of the lower\r\norders has reached a point, at which it begins to bear its necessary\r\nfruit, and every day makes the harvest darker and more sure.[128]\r\n\r\nThe general principles by which employment should be regulated may be\r\nbriefly stated as follows:\r\n\r\n1. There being three great classes of mechanical powers at our\r\ndisposal, namely, (_a_) vital muscular power; (_b_) natural mechanical\r\npower of wind, water, and electricity; and (_c_) artificially produced\r\nmechanical power; it is the first principle of economy to use all\r\navailable vital power first, then the inexpensive natural forces, and\r\nonly at last to have recourse to artificial power. And this, because\r\nit is always better for a man to work with his own hands to feed and\r\nclothe himself, than to stand idle while a machine works for him; and\r\nif he cannot by all the labor healthily possible to him, feed and\r\nclothe himself, then it is better to use an inexpensive machine--as\r\na wind-mill or water-mill--than a costly one like a steam-engine,\r\nso long as we have natural force enough at our disposal. Whereas at\r\npresent we continually hear economists regret that the water-powers\r\nof the cascades or streams of a country should be lost, but hardly\r\never that the muscular power of its idle inhabitants should be lost;\r\nand, again, we see vast districts, as the south of Provence, where a\r\nstrong wind[129] blows steady all day long for six days out of seven\r\nthroughout the year, without a wind-mill, while men are continually\r\nemployed a hundred miles to the north, in digging fuel to obtain\r\nartificial power.\r\n\r\nBut the principal point of all to be kept in view is that in every\r\nidle arm and shoulder throughout the country there is a certain\r\nquantity of force, equivalent to the force of so much fuel; and that\r\nit is mere insane waste to dig for coal for our force, while the vital\r\nforce is unused; and not only unused, but, in being so, corrupting and\r\npolluting itself. We waste our coal and spoil our humanity at one and\r\nthe same instant. Therefore, whenever there is an idle arm, always\r\nsave coal with it, and the stores of England will last all the longer.\r\nAnd precisely the same argument answers the common one about \"taking\r\nemployment out of the hands of the industrious laborer.\" Why, what is\r\n\"employment\" but the putting out of vital force instead of mechanical\r\nforce? We are continually in search of means of strength--to pull,\r\nto hammer, to fetch, to carry; we waste our future resources to get\r\npower, while we leave all the living fuel to burn itself out in mere\r\npestiferous breath and production of its variously noisome forms of\r\nashes! Clearly, if we want fire for force, we want men for force first.\r\nThe industrious hands _must_ have so much to do that they can do no\r\nmore, or else we need not use machines to help them: then use the idle\r\nhands first. Instead of dragging petroleum with a steam-engine, put it\r\non a canal, and drag it with human arms and shoulders. Petroleum cannot\r\npossibly be in a hurry to arrive anywhere. We can always order that\r\nand many other things time enough before we want it. So the carriage\r\nof everything which does not spoil by keeping may most wholesomely and\r\nsafely be done by water-traction and sailing vessels, and no healthier\r\nwork nor better discipline can men be put to than such active porterage.\r\n\r\n2. In employing all the muscular power at our disposal, we are to make\r\nthe employments we choose as educational as possible. For a wholesome\r\nhuman employment is the first and best method of education, mental as\r\nwell as bodily. A man taught to plough, row or steer well, and a woman\r\ntaught to cook properly and make dress neatly, are already educated\r\nin many essential moral habits. Labor considered as a discipline has\r\nhitherto been thought of only for criminals; but the real and noblest\r\nfunction of labor is to prevent crime, and not to be _Re_formatory but\r\nFormatory.\r\n\r\n3. The third great principle of employment is, that whenever there\r\nis pressure of poverty to be met, all enforced occupation should be\r\ndirected to the production of useful articles only, that is to say, of\r\nfood, of simple clothing, of lodging, or of the means of conveying,\r\ndistributing, and preserving these. It is yet little understood by\r\neconomists, and not at all by the public, that the employment of\r\npersons in a useless business cannot relieve ultimate distress. The\r\nmoney given to employ riband-makers at Coventry is merely so much money\r\nwithdrawn from what would have employed lace-makers at Honiton, or\r\nmakers of something else, as useless, elsewhere. We _must_ spend our\r\nmoney in some way, at some time, and it cannot at any time be spent\r\nwithout employing somebody. If we gamble it away, the person who wins\r\nit must spend it; if we lose it in a railroad speculation, it has\r\ngone into some one else's pockets, or merely gone to pay navvies for\r\nmaking a useless embankment, instead of to pay riband or button makers\r\nfor making useless ribands or buttons; we cannot lose it (unless by\r\nactually destroying it) without giving employment of some kind, and\r\ntherefore, whatever quantity of money exists, the relative quantity\r\nof employment must some day came out of it; but the distress of the\r\nnation signifies that the employments given have produced nothing that\r\nwill support its existence. Men cannot live on ribands, or buttons, or\r\nvelvet, or by going quickly from place to place; and every coin spent\r\nin useless ornament, or useless motion, is so much withdrawn from\r\nthe national means of life. Whereas every coin spent in cultivating\r\nground, in repairing lodgings, in making necessary and good roads,\r\nin preventing danger by sea or land, and in carriage of food or fuel\r\nwhere they are required, is so much absolute and direct gain to the\r\nwhole nation. To cultivate land round Coventry makes living easier at\r\nHoniton, and every house well built in Edinburgh makes lodgings cheaper\r\nin Glasgow and London.\r\n\r\n4th, and lastly. Since for every idle person some one else must be\r\nworking somewhere to provide him with clothes and food, and doing\r\ntherefore double the quantity of work that would be enough for his own\r\nneeds, it is only a matter of pure justice to compel the idle person\r\nto work for his maintenance himself. The conscription has been used in\r\nmany countries to take away laborers who supported their families from\r\ntheir useful work, and maintain them for purposes chiefly of military\r\ndisplay at public expense. Since this had been long endured by the\r\nmost civilized nations, let it not be thought that they would not much\r\nmore gladly endure a conscription which should seize only the vicious\r\nand idle already living by criminal procedures at the public expense,\r\nand which should discipline and educate them to labor, which would not\r\nonly maintain themselves, but be serviceable to the commonwealth.\r\nThe question is simply this: we must feed the drunkard, vagabond, and\r\nthief. But shall we do so by letting them rob us of their food, and do\r\nno work for it; or shall we give them their food in appointed quantity,\r\nand enforce their doing work which shall be worth it, and which, in\r\nprocess of time, will redeem their own characters, and make them happy\r\nand serviceable members of society?[130]\r\n\r\nThe different classes of work for which bodies of men could be\r\nconsistently organized might ultimately become numerous; these\r\nfollowing divisions of occupation may at once be suggested.\r\n\r\n1. Road-making.--Good roads to be made wherever needed, and kept in\r\nconstant repair; and the annual loss on unfrequented roads in spoiled\r\nhorses, strained wheels, and time, done away with.\r\n\r\n2. Bringing in of Waste Land.--All wastelands not necessary for public\r\nhealth, to be made accessible and gradually reclaimed.\r\n\r\n3. Harbor-Making.--The deficiencies of safe or convenient harborage\r\nin our smaller ports to be remedied; other harbors built at dangerous\r\npoints of coast, and a disciplined body of men always kept in\r\nconnection with the pilot and lifeboat services. There is room for\r\nevery order of intelligence in this work, and for a large body of\r\nsuperior officers.\r\n\r\n4. Porterage.--All heavy goods not requiring speed in transit, to be\r\ncarried (under preventive duty on transit by railroad) by canal boats,\r\nemploying men for draught, and the merchant shipping service extended\r\nby sea; so that no ships may be wrecked for want of hands, while there\r\nare idle ones in mischief on shore.\r\n\r\n5. Repair of Buildings.--A body of men in various trades to be kept\r\nat the disposal of the authorities in every large town for consistent\r\nrepair of buildings, especially the houses of the poorer orders, who,\r\nif no such provision were made, could not employ workmen on their own\r\nhouses, but would simply live with rent walls and roofs.\r\n\r\n6. Dress-making.--Substantial dress, of standard material and kind,\r\nstrong shoes, and stout bedding, to be manufactured for the poor, so as\r\nto render it unnecessary for them, unless by extremity of improvidence,\r\nto wear cast clothes, or be without sufficiency of clothing.\r\n\r\n7. Works of Art.--Schools to be established on thoroughly sound\r\nprinciples of manufacture and use of materials, and with simple and,\r\nfor given periods, unalterable modes of work; first in pottery, and\r\nembracing gradually metal work, sculpture, and decorative painting;\r\nthe two points insisted upon, in distinction from ordinary commercial\r\nestablishments, being perfectness of material to the utmost attainable\r\ndegree; and the production of everything by hand-work, for the special\r\npurpose of developing personal power and skill in the workman.\r\n\r\nThe two last departments, and some subordinate branches of the others,\r\nwould include the service of women and children.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[126] There were two editions of this pamphlet. The first was entitled\r\n\"First Notes on the General Principles of Employment for the Destitute\r\nand Criminal Classes. By John Ruskin, A.M.

People would say\r\nI wasn't practical, as usual of course; but it seems to me the last\r\nthing one should do in the business is to play Lord Angelo, and set\r\nbar and door to deluge.

Look at Hogarth's two 'prentices;\r\nthe sum of social wisdom is in that bit of rude art-work, if one reads\r\nit solemnly.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[139] The following letters were addressed by Mr. Ruskin to the author\r\nof a pamphlet on continence, entitled \"The Science of Life.\" There were\r\ntwo editions of the pamphlet, and of these only the second contained\r\nthe first and last of these letters, whilst only the first contained\r\nthe last letter but one. Some passages also in the other letters are\r\nomitted in the first edition, and a few slight alterations are made in\r\nthe second in the letter of February 10.\r\n\r\n[140] For further notice by Mr. Ruskin of this maxim, which occurs in\r\nMr. Herbert Spencer's \"Study of Sociology,\" p. 205, see the article on\r\n\"Home and its Economies\" in the _Contemporary Review_ of May, 1873, and\r\n\"Bibliotheca Pastorum,\" p. xxxiv.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VENICE, _February 10th_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHENCE, if from any place in earth, I ought to be able to send you\r\nsome words of warning to English youths, for the ruin of this mighty\r\ncity was all in one word--fornication. Fools who think they can write\r\nhistory will tell you it was \"the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope,\"\r\nand the like! Alas it was indeed the covering of every hope she had, in\r\nGod and his Law.\r\n\r\nFor indeed, my dear friend, I doubt if you can fight this evil by\r\nmere heroism and common-sense. Not many men are heroes; not many are\r\nrich in common-sense. They will train for a boat-race; will they for\r\nthe race of life? For the applause of the pretty girls in blue on the\r\nbanks; yes. But to win the soul and body of a noble woman for their own\r\nforever, will they? Not as things are going, I think, though how or\r\nwhere they are to go or end is to me at present inconceivable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYou think, perhaps, I could help you therefore with a lecture on good\r\ntaste and Titian? No, not at all; I might with one on politics, but\r\nthat everybody would say was none of my business. Yet to understand the\r\nreal meaning of the word \"Sire,\" with respect to the rider as well as\r\nthe horse, is indeed the basis of all knowledge, in policy, chivalry,\r\nand social order.\r\n\r\nAll that you have advised and exposed is wisely said and bravely told;\r\nbut no advice, no exposure, will be of use, until the right relation\r\nexists again between the father and the mother and their son. To\r\ndeserve his confidence, to keep it as the chief treasure committed in\r\ntrust to them by God: to be the father his strength, the mother his\r\nsanctification, and both his chosen refuge, through all weakness, evil,\r\ndanger, and amazement of his young life. My friend, while you still\r\nteach in Oxford the \"philosophy,\" forsooth, of that poor cretinous\r\nwretch, Stuart Mill, and are endeavoring to open other \"careers\" to\r\nEnglish women than that of the Wife and the Mother, you won't make\r\nyour men chaste by recommending them to leave off tea.[141]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[141] I have to state that this expression regarding Stuart Mill\r\nwas not intended for separate publication; and to explain that in a\r\nsubsequent but unpublished letter Mr. Ruskin explained it to refer to\r\nMill's utter deficiency in the powers of the imagination.--The last\r\nwords of this letter will be made clearer by noting that the pamphlet\r\ndealt with physical, as well as mental, diet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VENICE, _11th February_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR----: I would say much more, if I thought any one would\r\nbelieve me, of the especial calamity of this time, with respect to\r\nthe discipline of youth--in having no food any more to offer to their\r\nimagination. Military distinction is no more possible by prowess, and\r\nthe young soldier thinks of the hurdle-race as one of the lists and the\r\nfield--but the noble temper will not train for that trial with equal\r\njoy. Clerical eminence--the bishopric or popular pastorship--may be\r\ntempting to men of genial pride or sensitive conceit: but the fierce\r\nblood that would have burned into a patriarch, or lashed itself into a\r\nsaint--what \"career\" has your modern philosophy to offer to _it_?\r\n\r\nThe entire cessation of all employment for the faculty, which, in the\r\nbest men of former ages, was continually exercised and satisfied in the\r\nrealization of the presence of Christ with the hosts of Heaven, leaves\r\nthe part of the brain which it employed absolutely vacant, and ready\r\nto suck in, with the avidity of vacuum, whatever pleasantness may be\r\npresented to the natural sight in the gas-lighted beauty of pantomimic\r\nand casino Paradise.\r\n\r\nAll these disadvantages, you will say, are inevitable, and need not\r\nbe dwelt upon. In my own school of St. George I mean to avoid them by\r\nsimply making the study of Christianity a true piece of intellectual\r\nwork; my boys shall at least know what their fathers believed, before\r\nthey make up their own wise minds to disbelieve it. They shall be\r\ninfidels, if they choose, at thirty; but only students, and very modest\r\nones, at fifteen. But I shall at least ask of modern science so much\r\nhelp as shall enable me to begin to teach them at that age the physical\r\nlaws relating to their own bodies, openly, thoroughly, and with awe;\r\nand of modern civilization, I shall ask so much help as may enable me\r\nto teach them what is indeed right, and what wrong, for the citizen\r\nof a state of noble humanity to do, and permit to be done, by others,\r\nunaccused.\r\n\r\nAnd if you can found two such chairs in Oxford--one, of the Science of\r\nPhysical Health; the other, of the Law of Human Honor--you need not\r\ntrim your Horace, nor forbid us our chatty afternoon tea.\r\n\r\nI could say ever so much more, of course, if there were only time, or\r\nif it would be of any use--about the mis-appliance of the imagination.\r\nBut really, the essential thing is the founding of real schools of\r\ninstruction for both boys and girls--first, in domestic medicine\r\nand all that it means; and secondly, in the plain moral law of all\r\nhumanity: \"Thou shalt not commit adultery,\" with all that _it_ means.\r\n\r\n  Ever most truly yours,\r\n                              J. RUSKIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             VENICE, _12th February_, '77.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR----: Two words more, and an end. I have just re-read the paper\r\nthroughout. There are two omissions which seem to me to need serious\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nThe first, that the entire code of counsel which you have drawn up,\r\nas that which a father should give his son, must be founded on the\r\nassumption that, at the proper time of life, the youth will be able,\r\nno less than eager, to marry. You ought certainly to point out,\r\nincidentally, what in my St. George's work I am teaching primarily,\r\nthat unless this first economical condition of human society be\r\nsecured, all props and plasters of its morality will be in vain.\r\n\r\nAnd in the second place, you have spoken too exclusively of Lust, as\r\nif _it_ were the normal condition of sexual feeling, and the only one\r\nproperly to be called sexual. But the great relation of the sexes is\r\nLove, not Lust; that is the relation in which \"male and female created\r\nHe them;\" putting into them, indeed, to be distinctly restrained to the\r\noffice of fruitfulness, the brutal passion of Lust: but giving them the\r\nspiritual power of Love, that each spirit might be greater and purer by\r\nits bond to another associate spirit, in this world, and that which is\r\nto come; help-mates, and sharers of each other's joy forever.\r\n\r\n  Ever most truly yours,\r\n                              J. RUSKIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  MALHAM, _July 3d_, 1878.\r\n\r\n\r\nDear----: I wish I were able to add a few more words, with energy and\r\nclearness, to my former letters, respecting a subject of which my best\r\nstrength--though in great part lately given to it, has not yet enforced\r\nthe moment--the function, namely, of the arts of music and dancing as\r\nleaders and governors of the bodily, and instinctive mental, passions.\r\nNo nation will ever bring up its youth to be at once refined and pure,\r\ntill its masters have learned the _use_ of all the arts, and primarily\r\nof these; till they again recognize the gulf that separates the Doric\r\nand Lydian modes, and perceive the great ordinance of Nature, that the\r\npleasures which, rightly ordered, exalt, discipline, and guide the\r\nhearts of men, if abandoned to a reckless and popular Dis-order, as\r\nsurely degrade, scatter, and deceive alike the passions and intellect.\r\n\r\nI observe in the journals of yesterday, announcement that the masters\r\nof many of our chief schools are at last desirous of making the\r\nelements of Greek art one of the branches of their code of instruction:\r\nbut that they imagine such elements may be learned from plaster casts\r\nof elegant limbs and delicate noses.\r\n\r\nThey will find that Greek art can only be learned from Greek law, and\r\nfrom the religion which gives law of life to all the nations of the\r\nearth. Let our youth once more learn the meaning of the words \"music,\"\r\n\"chorus,\" and \"hymn\" practically; and with the understanding that all\r\nsuch practice, from lowest to highest, is, if rightly done, always in\r\nthe presence and to the praise of God; and we shall have gone far\r\nto shield them in a noble peace and glorious safety from the darkest\r\nquestions and the foulest sins that have perplexed and consumed the\r\nyouth of past generations for the last four hundred years.\r\n\r\nHave you ever heard the charity children sing in St. Paul's? Suppose\r\nwe sometimes allowed God the honor of seeing our _noble_ children\r\ncollected in like manner to sing to Him, what think you might be the\r\neffect of such a festival--even if only held once a year--on the\r\nnational manners and hearts?\r\n\r\n  Ever faithfully and affectionately yours,\r\n                                        J.

You will see\r\nthe subject treated as fully as I am able in the course of the papers\r\non political economy, of which the two first have already appeared in\r\nFraser's Magazine.[145]\r\n\r\nThe man and woman are meant by God to be perfectly noble and beautiful\r\nin each other's eyes. The dress is right which makes them so. The best\r\ndress is that which is beautiful in the eyes of noble and wise persons.\r\n\r\nRight dress is therefore that which is fit for the station in\r\nlife, and the work to be done in it; and which is otherwise\r\ngraceful--becoming--lasting--healthful--and easy; on occasion,\r\nsplendid; _always_ as beautiful as possible.\r\n\r\nRight dress is therefore strong--simple--radiantly clean--carefully put\r\non--carefully kept.\r\n\r\nCheap dress, bought for cheapness sake, and costly dress bought for\r\ncostliness sake, are _both_ abominations. Right dress is bought _for_\r\nits worth, and _at_ its worth; and bought only when wanted.\r\n\r\nBeautiful dress is chiefly beautiful in color--in harmony of parts--and\r\nin mode of putting on and wearing. Rightness of mind is in nothing more\r\nshown than in the mode of wearing simple dress.\r\n\r\nOrnamentation involving design, such as embroidery, etc., produced\r\n_solely_ by industry of _hand_, is highly desirable in the state\r\ndresses of all classes, down to the lowest peasantry.\r\n\r\nNational costume, wisely adopted and consistently worn, is not only\r\ndesirable but necessary in right national organization. Obeying fashion\r\nis a great folly, and a greater crime; but gradual changes in dress\r\nproperly accompany a healthful national development.\r\n\r\nThe Scriptural authority for dress is centralized by Proverbs xxxi.\r\n21, 22; and by 1 Samuel i. 24; the latter especially indicating the\r\nduty of the king or governor of the state; as the former the duty of\r\nthe housewife. It is necessary for the complete understanding of those\r\npassages, that the reader should know that \"scarlet\" means intense\r\ncentral radiance of pure color; it is the type of purest color--between\r\npale and dark--between sad and gay. It was therefore used with hyssop\r\nas a type of purification. There are many stronger passages, such as\r\nPsalm xlv. 13, 14; but as some people read them under the impression of\r\ntheir being figurative, I need not refer to them. The passages in the\r\nProphecies and Epistles against dress apply only to its abuses. Dress\r\nworn for the sake of vanity, or coveted in jealousy, is as evil as\r\nanything else similarly so abused. A woman should earnestly desire to\r\nbe beautiful, as she should desire to be intelligent; her dress should\r\nbe as studied as her words; but if the one is worn or the other spoken\r\nin vanity or insolence, both are equally criminal.\r\n\r\nI have not time, and there is no need, to refer you to the scattered\r\nnotices of dress in my books: the most important is rather near the\r\nbeginning of my Political Economy of Art;[146] but I have not the\r\nbook by me: if you make any use of this letter (you may make any you\r\nplease), I should like you to add that passage to it, as it refers to\r\nthe more immediate need of economy in dress, when the modes of its\r\nmanufacture are irregular, and cause distress to the operative.\r\n\r\n  Believe me, my dear Sir, very faithfully yours,\r\n                                           J.

But the attainment of this monotony was never a proposition of\r\nmine; and as I am well aware Mr. Brooke would not have been guilty of\r\nmisrepresentation, if he had had time to read the books he was speaking\r\nof, I am sure he will concur in my request that you would print in full\r\nthe passages to which he imagined himself to be referring.\r\n\r\n  I am, Sir, your obedient servant,\r\n                                  JOHN RUSKIN.\r\n\r\n1. \"You ladies like to lead the fashion: by all means lead it.

Secondly, preserving\r\nits produce carefully; that is to say, laying up your wheat wisely\r\nin storehouses for the time of famine, and keeping your embroidery\r\nwatchfully from the moth; and lastly, distributing its produce\r\nseasonably; that is to say, being able to carry your corn at once to\r\nthe place where the people are hungry, and your embroideries to the\r\nplace where they are gay; so fulfilling in all ways the wise man's\r\ndescription, whether of the queenly housewife or queenly nation: 'She\r\nriseth while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a\r\nportion to her maidens. She maketh herself coverings of tapestry, her\r\nclothing is silk and purple. Strength and honor are in her clothing,\r\nand she shall rejoice in time to come.'\r\n\r\n\"Now you will observe that in this description of the perfect\r\neconomist, or mistress of a household, there is a studied expression\r\nof the balanced division of her care between the two great objects\r\nof utility and splendor: in her right hand, food and flax, for life\r\nand clothing; in her left hand, the purple and the needlework, for\r\nhonor and for beauty.... And in private and household economy you may\r\nalways judge of its perfectness by its fair balance between the use\r\nand the pleasure of its possessions: you will see the wise cottager's\r\ngarden trimly divided between its well-set vegetables and its fragrant\r\nflowers: you will see the good housewife taking pride in her pretty\r\ntablecloth and her glittering shelves, no less than in her well-dressed\r\ndish and full store-room: the care will alternate with gayety; and\r\nthough you will reverence her in her seriousness, you will know her\r\nbest by her smile.\"--\"Political Economy of Art\" (1857), pp. 10-13.[149]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[147] Mr. Stopford Brooke's article was a review of Mr. Ruskin's\r\n\"Lectures on Art\" delivered at Oxford, and then recently published.\r\nIn a note to the present letter the Editor of the Magazine stated Mr.\r\nBrooke's regret \"at having been led by a slip of memory into making an\r\ninaccurate statement.\"\r\n\r\n[148] See the 1873 edition of the \"Crown of Wild Olive,\" p. 30, § 27.\r\n\r\n[149] See \"A Joy for Ever\" (1880), pp. 7-9.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From \"The Times,\" October 24, 1862.]\r\n\r\n_OAK SILKWORMS._\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of \"The Times.\"_\r\n\r\nSIR: In your excellent article of October 17, on possible substitutes\r\nfor cotton, you say \"it is very doubtful whether we could introduce\r\nthe silkworm with profit.\" The silkworm of the mulberry tree, indeed,\r\nrequires a warmer climate than ours, but has attention yet been\r\ndirected to the silkworm of the oak? A day or two ago a physician\r\nof European reputation, Dr. L. A. Gosse, was speaking to me of the\r\nexperiments recently made in France in its acclimatization. He stated\r\nto me that the only real difficulty was temporary--namely, in the\r\nimportation of the eggs, which are prematurely hatched as they are\r\nbrought through warm latitudes. A few only have reached Europe, and\r\ntheir multiplication is slow, but once let them be obtained in quantity\r\nand the stripping of an oak coppice is both robe and revenue. The silk\r\nis stronger than that of the mulberry tree, and the stuff woven of it\r\nmore healthy than cotton stuffs for the wearer; it also wears twice as\r\nlong.

I meant to have asked your leave to do so at some\r\nlength, but have been entirely busy, and can only say, respecting two\r\nof your questions, what in my own mind are the answers.\r\n\r\nI. \"How many authors are strong enough to do without advertisements?\"\r\n\r\nNone: while advertisement is the practice. But let it become the\r\nfashion to announce books once for all in a monthly circular\r\n(publisher's, for instance), and the public will simply refer to that\r\nfor all they want to know. Such advertisement I use now, and always\r\nwould.\r\n\r\nII. \"Why has he determined to be his own publisher?\"\r\n\r\nI wish entirely to resist the practice of writing for money early in\r\nlife. I think an author's business requires as much training as a\r\nmusician's, and that, as soon as he can write really well, there would\r\nalways, for a man of worth and sense, be found capital enough to enable\r\nhim to be able to print, say, a hundred pages of his careful work;\r\nwhich, if the public were pleased with, they would soon enable him to\r\nprint more. I do not think young men should rush into print, nor old\r\nones modify their books to please publishers.\r\n\r\nIII. And it seems to me, considering that the existing excellent\r\nbooks in the world would--if they were heaped together in great\r\ntowns--overtop their cathedrals, that at _any_ age a man should think\r\nlong before he invites his neighbors to listen to _his_ sayings on any\r\nsubject whatever.\r\n\r\nWhat I do, therefore, is done only in the conviction, foolish,\r\negotistic, whatever you like to call it, but firm, that I am writing\r\nwhat is needful and useful for my fellow-creatures; that if it is so,\r\nthey will in due time discover it, and that before due time I do not\r\nwant it discovered. And it seems to me that no sound scholar or true\r\nwell-wisher to the people about him would write in any other temper.\r\nI mean to be paid for my work, if it is worth payment. Not otherwise.\r\nAnd it seems to me my mode of publication is the proper method of\r\nascertaining that fact. I had much more to say, but have no more time,\r\nand am, sir, very respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n                                                   JOHN RUSKIN.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[150] This letter refers to an article on Mr. Ruskin's peculiar method\r\nof publication which appeared in the _World_ of May 26, 1875. It was\r\nentitled \"Ruskin to the Rescue,\" and with the criticism to which\r\nMr. Ruskin alludes, strongly approved the idea of some reform being\r\nattempted in the matter of the publication of books. Mr. Ruskin began\r\nthe still-continued method of publishing his works in 1871; and the\r\nfollowing advertisement, inserted in the earlier copies of the first\r\nbook thus published--\"Sesame and Lilies\"--will give the reader further\r\ninformation on the matter.\r\n\r\n\"It has long been in my mind to make some small beginning of resistance\r\nto the existing system of irregular discount in the bookselling\r\ntrade--not in hostility to booksellers, but, as I think they will find\r\neventually, with a just regard to their interest, as well as to that of\r\nauthors. Every volume of this series of my collected works will be sold\r\nto the trade without any discount or allowance on quantity, at such a\r\nfixed price as will allow both author and publisher a moderate profit\r\non each volume. It will be sold to the trade only; who can then fix\r\nsuch further profit on it as they deem fitting, for retail.\r\n\r\n\"Every volume will be clearly printed, and thoroughly well bound:\r\non such conditions the price to the public, allowing full profit to\r\nthe retailer, may sometimes reach, but ought never to exceed, half a\r\nguinea, nor do I wish it to be less. I will fully state my reasons for\r\nthis procedure in the June number of _Fors Clavigera_.\r\n\r\n\"The price of this first volume to the trade is seven shillings.\"\r\n\r\nIn subsequent similar notices, some parts of this plan, especially as\r\nregarded purchasers and price, were altered; the trade not accepting\r\nthe offer of sale to them only, and the \"trouble and difficulty of\r\nrevising text and preparing plates\" proving much greater than Mr.\r\nRuskin had expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From \"The Pall Mall Gazette,\" January 11, 1875.]\r\n\r\n_A MISTAKEN REVIEW._[151]\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of \"The Pall Mall Gazette.\"_\r\n\r\nSIR: The excellent letters and notes which have recently appeared in\r\nyour columns on the subject of reviewing lead me to think that you will\r\ngive me space for the statement of one or two things which I believe it\r\nis right the public should know respecting the review which appeared in\r\nthe _Examiner_ of the 2d of this month (but which I did not see till\r\nyesterday), by Mr. W. B. Scott, of Mr. St. J. Tyrrwhitt's \"Letters on\r\nLandscape Art.\"\r\n\r\n1. Mr. Scott is one of the rather numerous class of artists of whose\r\nworks I have never taken any public notice, and who attribute my\r\nsilence to my inherent stupidity of disposition.\r\n\r\n2. Mr. Scott is also one of the more limited and peculiarly unfortunate\r\nclass of artists who suppose themselves to have great native genius,\r\ndislike being told to learn perspective, and prefer the first volume of\r\n\"Modern Painters,\" which praises many third-rate painters, and teaches\r\nnone, to the following volumes, which praise none but good painters,\r\nand sometimes admit the weakness of advising bad ones.\r\n\r\n3. My first acquaintance with Mr. Scott was at the house of a gentleman\r\nwhose interior walls he was decorating with historic frescos, and\r\nwhose patronage I (rightly or wrongly) imagined at that time to be of\r\nimportance to him. I was then more good-natured and less conscientious\r\nthan I am now, and my host and hostess attached weight to my opinions.\r\nI said all the good I truly could of the frescos, and no harm; painted\r\na corn-cockle on the walls myself, in reverent subordination to them;\r\ngot out of the house as soon afterwards as I could, and never since\r\nsought Mr. Scott's acquaintance further (though, to my regret, he was\r\nonce photographed in the same plate with Mr. Rosetti and me). Mr. Scott\r\nis an honest man, and naturally thinks me a hypocrite and turncoat as\r\nwell as a fool.\r\n\r\n4. The honestest man in writing a review is apt sometimes to give\r\nobscure statements of facts which ought to have been clearly stated to\r\nmake the review entirely fair. Permit me to state in very few words\r\nthose which I think the review in question does not clearly represent.\r\nMy \"Elements of Drawing\" were out of print, and sometimes asked for; I\r\nwished to rewrite them, but had no time, and knew that my friend and\r\npupil, Mr. Tyrrwhitt, was better acquainted than I myself with some\r\nprocesses of water-color sketching, and was perfectly acquainted with\r\nand heartily acceptant of the principles which I have taught to be\r\nessential in all art. I knew he could write, and I therefore asked him\r\nto write, a book of his own to take the place of the \"Elements,\" and\r\nauthorized him to make arrangements with my former publisher for my\r\nwood-blocks, mostly drawn on the wood by myself.\r\n\r\nThe book is his own, not mine, else it would have been published as\r\nmine, not his. I have not read it all, and do not answer for it all.\r\nBut when I wrote the \"Elements\" I believed conscientiously that book\r\nof mine to be the best then attainable by the public on the subject of\r\nelementary drawing. I think Mr. Tyrrwhitt's a better book, know it to\r\nbe a more interesting one, and believe it to be, in like manner, the\r\nbest now attainable by the British public on elementary practice of art.\r\n\r\n                     I am, Sir, your faithful servant,\r\n                                                     JOHN RUSKIN.\r\n\r\n  BRANTWOOD, _Jan._ 10.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[151] Of this review nothing need be said beyond what is stated in this\r\nletter. The full title of the book which it so harshly treated is \"Our\r\nSketching Club. Letters and Studies on Landscape Art.\" By the Rev. R.\r\nSt. John Tyrrwhitt, M.A. With an authorized reproduction of the lessons\r\nand woodcuts in Professor Ruskin's \"Elements of Drawing.\" Macmillan,\r\n1874. The \"letters and notes\" refer especially to one signed \"K\" in the\r\n_Gazette_ of January 1, and another signed \"A Young Author\" in that\r\nof January 4. The principal complaint of both these letters was that\r\nreviewers seldom master, and sometimes do not even read the books they\r\ncriticise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From \"The Pall Mall Gazette,\" January 19, 1875.]\r\n\r\n_THE POSITION OF CRITICS._\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of \"The Pall Mall Gazette.\"_\r\n\r\nSIR: I see you are writing of criticism;[152] some of your readers\r\nmay, perhaps, be interested in hearing the notions of a man who has\r\ndabbled in it a good many years. I believe, in a word, that criticism\r\nis as impertinent in the world as it is in a drawing-room. In a kindly\r\nand well-bred company, if anybody tries to please them, they try to be\r\npleased; if anybody tries to astonish them, they have the courtesy to\r\nbe astonished; if people become tiresome, they ask somebody else to\r\nplay, or sing, or what not, but they don't criticise. For the rest,\r\na bad critic is probably the most mischievous person in the world\r\n(Swift's Goddess of Criticism in the \"Tale of a Tub\" seems what need\r\nbe represented on that subject[153]), and a good one the most helpless\r\nand unhappy: the more he knows, the less he is trusted, and it is\r\ntoo likely he may become morose in his unacknowledged power. A good\r\nexecutant, in any art, gives pleasure to multitudes, and breathes an\r\natmosphere of praise, but a strong critic is every man's adversary--men\r\nfeel that he knows their foibles, and cannot conceive that he knows\r\nmore. His praise, to be acceptable, must be always unqualified; his\r\nequity is an offence instead of a virtue; and the art of correction,\r\nwhich he has learned so laboriously, only fills his hearers with\r\ndisgust.\r\n\r\n                     I am, Sir, your faithful servant,\r\n                                                     JOHN RUSKIN.\r\n\r\n  BRANTWOOD, _Jan._ 18.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[152] Since the correspondence already mentioned, the _Gazette_ of\r\nJanuary 14 and 18 had contained two long letters on the subject from \"A\r\nReviewer.\"\r\n\r\n[153] The Goddess of Criticism, with Ignorance and Pride for her\r\nparents, Opinion for her sister, and for her children Noise and\r\nImpudence, Dulness and Vanity, Positiveness, Pedantry, and Ill-manners,\r\nis described in the \"Battle of the Books\"--the paper which follows, and\r\nis a companion to the \"Tale of a Tub.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From \"The Critic,\" October 27, 1860.]\r\n\r\n_COVENTRY PATMORE'S \"FAITHFUL FOR EVER.\"_\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of \"The Critic.\"_\r\n\r\nSIR: I do not doubt, from what I have observed of the general tone of\r\nthe criticisms in your columns, that, in candor and courtesy, you will\r\nallow me to enter protest, bearing such worth as private opinion may,\r\nagainst the estimate expressed in your last number of the merits of\r\nMr. C. Patmore's new poem.[154] It seems to me that you have read it\r\nhastily; and that you have taken such view of it as on a first reading\r\nalmost every reader of good but impatient judgment would be but too\r\napt to concur with you in adopting--one, nevertheless, which, if you\r\nexamine the poem with care, you will, I think, both for your readers'\r\nsake and Mr. Patmore's, regret having expressed so decidedly.\r\n\r\nThe poem is, to the best of my perception and belief, a singularly\r\nperfect piece of art; containing, as all good art does, many very\r\ncurious shortcomings (to appearance), and places of rest, or of dead\r\ncolor, or of intended harshness, which, if they are seen or quoted\r\nwithout the parts of the piece to which they relate, are of course\r\nabsurd enough, precisely as the discords in a fine piece of music\r\nwould be if you played them without their resolutions. You have quoted\r\nseparately Mr. Patmore's discords; you might by the same system of\r\nexamination have made Mozart or Mendelssohn appear to be no musicians,\r\nas you have probably convinced your quick readers that Mr. Patmore is\r\nno poet.\r\n\r\nI will not beg of you so much space as would be necessary to analyze\r\nthe poem, but I hope you will let me--once for all--protest against\r\nthe method of criticism which assumes that entire familiarity and\r\nsimplicity in certain portions of a great work destroy its dignity.\r\nSimple things ought to be simply said, and truly poetical diction is\r\nnothing more nor less than right diction; the incident being itself\r\npoetical or not, according to its relations and the feelings which\r\nit is intended to manifest--not according to its own nature merely.\r\nTo take a single instance out of Homer bearing on that same simple\r\nhousehold work which you are so shocked at Mr. Patmore's taking notice\r\nof, Homer describes the business of a family washing, when it comes\r\ninto his poem, in the most accurate terms he can find. \"They took the\r\nclothes in their hands; and poured on the clean water; and trod them\r\nin trenches thoroughly, trying who could do it best; and when they\r\nhad washed them and got off all the dirt, they spread them out on the\r\nsea-beach, where the sea had blanched the shingle cleanest.\"[155]\r\n\r\nThese are the terms in which the _great_ poet explains the matter.\r\nThe less poet--or, rather, man of modern wit and breeding, _without_\r\nsuperior poetical power--thus puts the affair into dignified language:\r\n\r\n    Then emulous the royal robes they lave,\r\n    And plunge the vestures in the cleansing wave,\r\n    (The vestures cleansed o'erspread the shelly sand,\r\n    Their snowy lustre whitens all the strand.)\r\n\r\nNow, to my mind, Homer's language is by far the most poetical of the\r\ntwo--is, in fact, the only poetical language possible in the matter.\r\nWhether it was desirable to give any account of this, or anything else,\r\ndepends wholly on the relation of the passage to the rest of the poem,\r\nand you could only show Mr. Patmore's glance into the servant's room to\r\nbe ridiculous by proving the mother's mind, which it illustrates, to be\r\nridiculous. Similarly, if you were to take one of Mr. George Richmond's\r\nperfectest modern portraits, and give a little separate engraving of a\r\nbit of the neck-tie or coat-lappet, you might easily demonstrate a very\r\nprosaic character either in the riband-end or the button-hole. But the\r\nonly real question respecting them is their relation to the face, and\r\nthe degree in which they help to express the character of the wearer.\r\nWhat the real relations of the parts are in the poem in question only\r\na thoughtful and sensitive reader will discover. The poem is not meant\r\nfor a song, or calculated for an hour's amusement; it is, as I said,\r\nto the best of my belief, a finished and tender work of very noble\r\nart. Whatever on this head may be the final judgment of the public, I\r\nam bound, for my own part, to express my obligation to Mr. Patmore,\r\nas one of my severest models and tutors in use of English, and my\r\nrespect for him as one of the truest and tenderest thinkers who have\r\never illustrated the most important, because commonest, states of noble\r\nhuman life.[156]\r\n\r\n                           I remain, Sir, yours, etc.,\r\n                                                       J.

Every British sailor knows,\r\nthat Neptune is the god of the sea. He does _not_ know that Athena is\r\nthe goddess of the air; I doubt if many of our school-boys know it--I\r\ndoubt even if many of our school-masters know it; and I believe the\r\nevidence of it given in the \"Queen of the Air\" to be the first clear\r\nand connected approximate proof of it which has yet been rendered by\r\nscientific mythology, properly so called.\r\n\r\nYou say, \"I have not attempted to explain all mythology.\"\r\n\r\nI wonder what you would have said of me if I _had_? I only know a\r\nlittle piece of it here and there, just as I know a crag of alp or\r\na bend of river; and even what I know could not be put into a small\r\noctavo volume. Nevertheless, I should have had another such out by this\r\ntime on the Apolline Myths, and, perhaps, one on the Earth-Gods, but\r\nfor my Oxford work; and shall at all events have a little more to say\r\non the matter than I have yet said--and much need there is--when all\r\nthat has yet been done by \"scientific\" mythology ends in the assertion\r\nmade by your reviewer, that \"mythology is useful mainly as a storehouse\r\nfor poets, and for literary men in want of some simile or metaphor to\r\nproduce a striking effect.\"\r\n\r\n                     I am, Sir, your faithful servant,\r\n                                                     JOHN RUSKIN.\r\n\r\n  _May_ 18, 1871.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[157] The article was entitled \"Aryan Mythology: Second Notice,\" the\r\nfirst notice having been a review of Mr. Gladstone's \"Juventus Mundi,\"\r\nand of some other mythological works. (See the _Asiatic_, April 25 and\r\nMay 16, 1871.) The nature of the praise and criticism of the article\r\nmay be gathered from this letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From \"The Morning Chronicle,\" January 20, 1855. (Reprinted in \"The\r\nEvening Journal,\" January 22.)]\r\n\r\n_THE ANIMALS OF SCRIPTURE: A REVIEW._[158]\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the various illustrated works which usually grace the beginning\r\nof the year, has appeared one which, though of graver and less\r\nattractive character than its companions, is likely to occupy a more\r\npermanent place on the library shelves. We allude to \"Illustrations of\r\nScripture, by an Animal Painter,\" a work which, whatever its faults\r\nor weaknesses, shows at least a singular power of giving reality and\r\ninterest to scenes which are apt to be but feebly, if at all, brought\r\nbefore the mental vision, in consequence of our familiarity with the\r\nwords which describe them. The idea of the work is itself sufficiently\r\noriginal. The animals are throughout principal, and the pathos or\r\nmoral of the passage to be illustrated is developed from its apparently\r\nsubordinate part in it. Thus the luxury and idolatry of the reign of\r\nSolomon are hinted behind a group of \"apes and peacocks;\" the Deluge is\r\nsubordinate to the dove; and the healing of the lunatic at Gennesareth\r\nto the destruction of the herd of swine.\r\n\r\nIn general, to approach an object from a new point of view is to\r\nplace it in a clearer light, and perhaps the very strangeness of the\r\ntreatment in some cases renders the subject more impressive than it\r\ncould have been made by any more regular method of conception. But, at\r\nall events, supposing the studies of the artist to have been chiefly\r\ndirected to animals, and her power to lie principally in seizing\r\ntheir character, she is to be thanked for filling her sketches of the\r\ninferior creatures with so much depth of meaning, and rendering the\r\ndelineation even of an ape, or a swallow, suggestive of the most solemn\r\ntrains of thought.\r\n\r\nAs so suggestive, without pretence or formalism, these drawings deserve\r\na place of peculiar honor in the libraries of the young, while there\r\nare also some qualities in them which fit them for companionship with\r\nmore elaborate works of art. The subject of \"Lazarus\" is treated with\r\na courage and tenderness which say much for the painter's imagination,\r\nand more for her heart; and the waste of waters above which the raven\r\nhovers is expressed, though rudely, yet in a way which tells of many\r\nan hour spent in watching the play of the evening light upon the\r\nmovement of the wearied sea. It is true that most of the compositions\r\nare weakened by a very visible contempt, if not ignorance, of the\r\nlaws which regulate the harmonies of shade, as well as by a painful\r\ndeficiency in the drawing. Still there is a life and sincerity in them\r\nwhich are among the rarest qualities in art; and one characteristic,\r\nvery remarkable in the works of a person described in the text (we\r\ndoubt not, much against her will) as an \"accomplished lady\"--we mean\r\nthe peculiar tendency to conceptions of fearfulness, or horror, rather\r\nthan of beauty. The camel, for instance, might, we should have thought,\r\nas easily, and to many persons much more pleasingly, have illustrated\r\nthe meeting of Rebekah with the servant of Abraham, as the desolation\r\nof Rabbah; and the dog might as gracefully have been brought forward\r\nto remind us of the words of the Syro-Phœnician woman, as to increase\r\nthe horror of the death of Jezebel. There are curious evidences of a\r\nsimilar disposition in some of the other plates; and while it appears\r\nto us indicative of the strength of a mind of no common order, we would\r\ncaution the fair artist against permitting it to appear too frequently.\r\nIt renders the series of drawings in some degree repulsive to many\r\npersons, and even by those who can sympathize with it might sometimes\r\nbe suspected of having its root in a sublime kind of affectation.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of these studies as drawings. They are, in fact, as\r\ngood, being photographic facsimiles of the original sketches. The text\r\nis copious, and useful as an elucidation of the natural history of\r\nScripture.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[158] The full title of the book here reviewed by Mr. Ruskin, and long\r\nsince out of print, was \"Twenty Photographs; being illustrations of\r\nScripture.

If the former, he will find, if he take the\r\ntrouble to look at the note in the 264th page of the second volume\r\nof the \"Stones of Venice,\" that Cary's reputation is not likely to\r\nsuffer at my hands.[160] But the translation in the instance quoted is\r\ninadmissible. It does not matter in the least whence the word \"limner\"\r\nis derived. I did not know when I found fault with it that it was a\r\ncorruption of \"illuminator,\" but I knew perfectly that it did not in\r\nthe existing state of the English language _mean_ \"illuminator.\" No one\r\ntalks of \"limning a missal,\" or of a \"limned missal.\" The word is now\r\nuniversally understood as signifying a painter or draughtsman in the\r\nordinary sense, and cannot be accepted as a _translation_ of the phrase\r\nof which it is a _corruption_.\r\n\r\nTouching the last clause of the letter, I should have thought that a\r\nmaster of arts of Cambridge might have had wit enough to comprehend\r\nthat characters may be illegible by being far off, as well as by being\r\nill-shaped; and that it is not less difficult to read what is too small\r\nto be seen than what is too strange to be understood. The inscription\r\non the Houses of Parliament are illegible, not because they are in\r\nblack letters, but because, like all the rest of the work on that, I\r\nsuppose, the most effeminate and effectless heap of stones ever raised\r\nby man, they are utterly unfit for their position.\r\n\r\n                                                     J. RUSKIN.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[159] In his lecture on \"the distinction between illumination and\r\npainting,\" being the first of a series on Decorative Color delivered\r\nat the Architectural Museum, Cannon Street, Westminster, Mr. Ruskin is\r\nreported (_Builder_, Nov. 25, 1854) to have said, \"The line which is\r\ngiven by Cary, 'which they of Paris call the limner's skill,' is not\r\nproperly translated. The word, which in the original is _'alluminare_,'\r\ndoes not mean the limner's art, but the art of the illuminator--the\r\nwriter and illuminator of books.\" In criticism of this remark, \"M. A.,\"\r\nwriting to the _Builder_ from Cambridge, defended Cary's translation by\r\nreferring to Johnson's dictionary to show that \"limner\" was after all\r\ncorrupted from \"enlumineur,\" _i.e._, \"a decorator of books with initial\r\npictures.\" His letter concluded by remarking upon another of Mr.\r\nRuskin's statements in the same lecture, namely, that \"Black letter is\r\nnot really illegible, it is only that we are not accustomed to it....\r\nThe fact is, _no_ kind of character is really illegible. If you wish to\r\nsee real illegibility, go to the Houses of Parliament and look at the\r\ninscriptions there!\"\r\n\r\nThe present letter was written in reply to \"M. A.,\" from whom the\r\nlatter portion of it elicited a further letter, together with one from\r\n\"Vindex,\" in defence of Sir Charles Barry and the Houses of Parliament\r\n(see the _Builder_, Dec. 16, 1854).\r\n\r\n[160] \"It is generally better to read ten lines of any poet in the\r\noriginal language, however painfully, than ten cantos of a translation.\r\nBut an exception may be made in favor of Cary's 'Dante.' If no poet\r\never was liable to lose more in translation, none was ever so carefully\r\ntranslated; and I hardly know whether most to admire the rigid\r\nfidelity, or the sweet and solemn harmony, of Cary's verse,\" etc. See\r\nthe note to the \"Stones of Venice,\" at the above-named page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From the \"Transactions of the New Shakspere Society\" for 1878-9, pp.\r\n409-12.]\r\n\r\n_NOTES ON A WORD IN SHAKESPEARE._[161]\r\n\r\n                             \"And yon gray lines\r\n    That _fret_ the clouds are messengers of day.\"\r\n\r\n                                    JULIUS CÆSAR, II. i. 103-4.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n             BRANTWOOD, CONISTON, LANCASHIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FURNIVALL: Of course, in any great writer's word, the question\r\nis far less what the word came from, than where it has come to. _Fret_\r\nmeans all manner of things in that place; primarily, the rippling\r\nof clouds--as sea by wind; secondarily, the breaking it asunder for\r\nlight to come through. It implies a certain degree of vexation--some\r\ndissolution--much _order_, and extreme beauty. I have myself used this\r\nword substantively, to express the rippled edge of a wing-feather. In\r\narchitecture and jewellery it means simply roughening in a decorative\r\nmanner.[162]\r\n\r\n  Ever affectionately yours,\r\n                                J. RUSKIN.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[161] This and the next letter were written in answer to Mr. Furnivall,\r\nwho, upon being questioned what appearance in the clouds was intended\r\nby the word \"fret\" in the above passage, referred the point to Mr.\r\nRuskin, whose answers were subsequently read at the forty-fifth meeting\r\nof the Society, Oct. 11, 1878.\r\n\r\n[162] In modern English \"chasing\" has got confused with it, but it\r\nshould be separated again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_NOTES ON A WORD IN SHAKESPEARE._\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n                            EDINBURGH, _29th Sept._, 1878.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR FURNIVALL: Your kind letter comes to me here, and I must answer on\r\nthis paper, for, if that bit of note is really of any use to you, you\r\nmust please add this word or two more in printing, as it wouldn't do\r\nto let it be such a mere fret on the vault of its subject. You say not\r\none man in 150 knows what the line means: my dear Furnivall, not one\r\nman in 15,000, in the 19th century, knows, or ever can know, what _any_\r\nline--or any _word_ means, used by a great writer. For most words stand\r\nfor things that are seen, or things that are thought of; and in the\r\n19th century there is certainly not one man in 15,000 who ever looks\r\nat anything, and not one in 15,000,000 capable of a thought. Take the\r\nintelligence of this word in this line for example--the root of the\r\nwhole matter is, first, that the reader should have seen what he has\r\noften heard of, but probably not seen twice in his life--\"Daybreak.\"\r\nNext, it is needful he should think what \"break\" means in that\r\nword--what is broken, namely, and by what. That is to say, the cloud of\r\nnight is Broken up, as a city is broken up (Jerusalem, when Zedekiah\r\nfled), as a school breaks up, as a constitution, or a ship, is broken\r\nup; in every case with a not inconsiderable change of idea and addition\r\nto the central word. This breaking up is done by the Day, which\r\nbreaks--_out_, as a man breaks, or bursts _out_, from his restraint in\r\na passion; breaks _down_ in tears; or breaks _in_, as from heaven to\r\nearth--with a breach in the cloud-wall of it; or breaks _out_, with a\r\nsense of _outward_--as the sun--out and out, farther and farther, after\r\nrain. Well; next, the thing that the day breaks up is partly a garment,\r\n_rent_, more than broken; a _mantle_, the day itself \"in russet mantle\r\nclad\"--the blanket of the dark, _torn_ to be peeped through--whereon\r\ninstantly you get into a whole host of new ideas; _fretting_ as a moth\r\n_frets_ a garment; unravelling at the edge, afterwards;--thence you\r\nget into _fringe_, which is an entirely double word, meaning partly a\r\nthing that guards, and partly a thing that is worn away on the ground;\r\nthe French _Frange_ has, I believe, a reminiscence of φρασσω in it--our\r\n\"fringe\" runs partly toward _frico_ and friction--both are essentially\r\nconnected with _frango_, and the fringe of \"breakers\" at the shores of\r\nall seas, and the breaking of the ripples and foam all over them--but\r\nthis is wholly different in a northern mind, which has only seen the sea\r\n\r\n           Break, break, break, on its _cold_ gray stones,--\r\n\r\nand a southern, which has seen a hot sea on hot sand break\r\ninto lightning of phosphor flame--half a mile of fire in an\r\ninstant--following in time, like the flash of minute-guns. Then come\r\nthe great new ideas of order and time, and\r\n\r\n    I did but tell her she mistook her _frets_,\r\n    And bowed her hand, etc.,\r\n\r\nand so the timely succession of either ball, flower, or dentil, in\r\narchitecture: but this, again, going off to a totally different and\r\nstill lovely idea, the main one in the word _aurifrigium_--which rooted\r\nonce in _aurifex_, went on in Etruscan work, followed in Florence into\r\na much closer connection with _frigidus_--their style being always in\r\n_frosted_ gold (see the dew on a cabbage-leaf or, better, on a gray\r\nlichen, in early sunshine)--going back, nobody knows how far, but to\r\nthe Temple of the Dew of Athens, and gold of Mycenæ, anyhow; and in\r\nEtruria to the Deluge, I suppose. Well, then, the notion of the music\r\nof morning comes in--with strings of lyre (or _frets_ of Katharine's\r\ninstrument, whatever it was) and stops of various _quills_; which gets\r\nus into another group beginning with _plectrum_, going aside again into\r\n_plico_ and _plight_, and Milton's\r\n\r\n                     \"Play in the plighted clouds\"\r\n\r\n(the quills on the fretful porcupine are all thought of, first, in\r\ntheir piped complexity like rushes, _before_ the standing up in\r\nill-temper), and so on into the _plight_ of folded drapery, and round\r\nagain to our blanket. I think that's enough to sketch out the compass\r\nof the word. Of course the real power of it in any place depends on the\r\nwriter's grasp of it, and use of the facet he wants to cut with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From \"The Theatre,\" March, 1880, p. 169.]\r\n\r\n\"_THE MERCHANT OF VENICE._\"[163]\r\n\r\n                                                  _6th Feb._, 1880.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that whatever Mr. Irving has stated that I said,\r\nI _did_ say. But in personal address to an artist, to whom one is\r\nintroduced for the first time, one does not usually say _all_ that\r\nmay be in one's mind. And if expressions, limited, if not even\r\nsomewhat exaggerated, by courtesy, be afterwards quoted as a total\r\nand carefully-expressed criticism, the general reader will be--or may\r\nbe easily--much misled. I did and _do_ much admire Mr. Irving's own\r\nacting of Shylock. But I entirely dissent (and indignantly as well as\r\nentirely) from his general reading and treatment of the play. And I\r\nthink that a modern audience will _invariably_ be not only wrong, but\r\ndiametrically and with polar accuracy opposite to the real view of any\r\ngreat author in the moulding of his work. So far as I could in kindness\r\nventure, I expressed my feelings to that effect, in a letter which I\r\nwrote to Mr. Irving on the day after I saw the play; and I should be\r\nsincerely obliged to him, under the existing circumstances, if he would\r\npublish THE WHOLE of that letter.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[163] The circumstances connected with the present letter, or rather\r\nextract from one, are as follows: After witnessing the performance\r\nof \"The Merchant of Venice\" at the Lyceum Theatre, Mr. Ruskin had\r\nsome conversation with Mr. Irving on the subject. In the _Theatre_ of\r\nJanuary 1880--p. 63--appeared a paragraph which stated that at the\r\ninterview named Mr. Ruskin had declared Mr. Irving's \"Shylock\" to be\r\n\"noble, tender, and true,\" and it is to that statement that the present\r\nletter, which appeared in the March number of the _Theatre_, relates.\r\nWith reference to the letter privately addressed to Mr. Irving, the\r\n_Theatre_ of April (p. 249) had a note to the effect that Mr. Irving\r\nhad, for excellent and commendable reasons, preferred it not being made\r\npublic. For a full statement of Mr. Ruskin's views of \"The Merchant of\r\nVenice,\" see \"Munera Pulveris,\" p. 102.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECITATIONS._\r\n\r\n                         SHEFFIELD, _16th February_, 1880.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:[164] I am most happy to assure you, in reply to your\r\ninteresting letter of the 12th, that I heard your daughters'\r\nrecitations in London last autumn, with quite unmixed pleasure and\r\nthe sincerest admiration--nor merely that, but with grave change in\r\nmy opinions of the general value of recitations as a means of popular\r\ninstruction. Usually, I like better to hear beautiful poetry read\r\nquietly than recited with action. But I felt, in hearing Shelley's\r\n\"Cloud\" recited (I think it was by Miss Josephine) that I also was\r\n\"one of the people,\" and understood the poem better than ever before,\r\nthough I am by way of knowing something about clouds, too. I also know\r\nthe \"Jackdaw of Rheims\" pretty nearly by heart; but I would gladly come\r\nto London straightway, had I the time, to hear Miss Peggy speak it\r\nagain. And--in fine--I have not seen any public entertainment--for many\r\na long year--at once so sweet, so innocent, and so helpful, as that\r\nwhich your children can give to all the gentle and simple in mind and\r\nheart.--Believe me, my dear Sir, faithfully, and with all felicitation,\r\nyours,\r\n\r\n                                                     J.

BENNETT: I hope this line will arrive in time to wish you\r\nand yours a happy New Year, and to assure you of the great pleasure I\r\nhad in receiving your poems from you, and of the continual pleasure\r\nI shall have in possessing them. I deferred writing to you in order\r\nthat I might tell you how I liked those which were new to me, but\r\nChristmas, and certain little \"pattering pairs of restless shoes\"\r\nwhich have somehow or another got into the house in his train, have\r\nhitherto prevented me from settling myself for a quiet read. In fact,\r\nI am terribly afraid of being quite turned upside down when I do,\r\nso as to lose my own identity, for you have already _nearly_ made\r\nme like babies, and I see an ode further on to another antipathy of\r\nmine--the only one I have in the kingdom of flowers--the chrysanthemum.\r\nHowever, I am sure you will be well pleased if you can cure me of all\r\n_dislikes_. I should write to you now more cheerfully, but that I am\r\nanxious for the person who, of all I know, has fewest dislikes and\r\nwarmest likings--for Miss Mitford.\r\n\r\nI trust she is better, and that she may be spared for many years to\r\ncome. I don't know if England has such another warm heart.\r\n\r\nI hope I may have the pleasure of seeing you here in case your\r\noccasions should at any time bring you to London, and\r\n\r\n  I remain, with much respect, most truly yours,\r\n                                          J.

It appeared that a girl, named\r\nMatilda Griggs, had been nearly murdered by her seducer, who, after\r\nstabbing her in no less than thirteen different places, had then left\r\nher for dead. She had, however, still strength enough to crawl into a\r\nfield close by, and there swooned. The assistance that she met with\r\nin this plight was of a rare kind. Two calves came up to her, and\r\ndisposing themselves on either side of her bleeding body, thus kept her\r\nwarm and partly sheltered from cold and rain Temporarily preserved,\r\nthe girl eventually recovered, and entered into recognizances, under a\r\nsum of forty pounds, to prosecute her murderous lover. But \"she loved\r\nmuch,\" and, failing to prosecute, forfeited her recognizances, and was\r\nimprisoned by the Chancellor of the Exchequer for her debt. \"Pity this\r\npoor debtor,\" wrote the _Daily Telegraph_, and in the next day's issue\r\nappeared the above letter, probably not intended for the publication\r\naccorded to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_EXCUSES FROM CORRESPONDENCE._\r\n\r\n  DENMARK HILL, S.,\r\n            _2d February_, 1868.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am about to enter on some work which cannot be well done or even\r\napproximately well, unless without interruption, and it would be\r\ndesirable for me, were it in my power, to leave home for some time,\r\nand carry out my undertaking in seclusion.

Of course,\r\none likes praise [and I'm so glad of it that I can take a great many\r\nkinds], but I never got any [that] I liked so much before, because, as\r\nfar as I [can] remember nobody ever noticed or allowed for the _range_\r\nof work I've had to do, and which really has been dreadfully costly and\r\npainful to me, compelling me to leave things just at the point when\r\none's work on them has become secure and delightsome, to attack them on\r\nanother rough side. It is a most painful manner of life, and I never\r\ngot any credit for it before. But the more I see, the more I feel the\r\nnecessity of seeing all round, however hastily.\r\n\r\nI am entirely grateful for the review and the understanding of me; and\r\nI needed some help just now--for I'm at once single-handed and dead--or\r\nworse--hearted, and as nearly beaten as I've been in my life.\r\n\r\nAlways therefore I shall be, for the encouragement at a heavy time,\r\n\r\n  Very gratefully yours,\r\n                     (Signed) J.

The first of them had also\r\nappeared previously in the _Liverpool Daily Albion_, and was reprinted\r\nwith the present letter in the weekly issue of Nov. 9.

Afterwards, all his lectures will be at twelve in this\r\nand future terms.

The general value of your article as a review of my work and\r\nmethods of writing will, I trust, rather be enhanced than diminished\r\nby the correction, due to Mr. Lowe, of this original error; and the\r\nmore, that your critic in the course of his review expresses his not\r\nunjustifiable conviction that no correspondence between Mr. Lowe and me\r\nis possible on any intellectual subject whatever.\r\n\r\n                     I am, Sir, your obedient servant,\r\n                                                    JOHN RUSKIN.\r\n\r\n  BRANTWOOD, CONISTON, LANCASHIRE,\r\n              _August_ 24.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[174] The article in question stated that a number of \"Fors Clavigera\"\r\nhad been sent to Mr. Lowe, and commented on by him in a letter to\r\nMr. Ruskin.

In seven days more I shall be fifty-nine; which\r\n(practically) is all the same as sixty; but being asked by the wife\r\nof my dear old friend, W. H. Harrison, to say a few words of our old\r\nrelations together, I find myself, in spite of all these years, a boy\r\nagain--partly in the mere thought of, and renewed sympathy with, the\r\ncheerful heart of my old literary master, and partly in instinctive\r\nterror lest, wherever he is in celestial circles, he should catch me\r\nwriting bad grammar, or putting wrong stops, and should set the table\r\nturning, or the like....

You don't make money out of\r\na Ship of the Line, nor should you out of a Church, nor should you out\r\nof a College, nor should you out of a Theatre.\r\n\r\nPay your Ship's officers, your Church officers, your College tutors,\r\nand your Stage tutors, what will honorably maintain them.

The ghastly want of sense of\r\nbeauty, and endurance of loathsomeness gaining hourly on the people!\r\n\r\nThey were playing the _Fille du Tambour Major_ superbly, for the\r\nmost part; they gave the introductory convent scene without the\r\nleast caricature, the Abbess being played by a very beautiful and\r\ngracefully-mannered actress, and the whole thing would have been\r\ndelightful had the mere decorations of the theatre been clean and\r\npretty. To think that all the strength of the world combining in Paris\r\nto amuse itself can't have clean box-curtains! or a pretty landscape\r\nsketch for a drop scene!--but sits in squalor and dismalness, with\r\nbills stuck all over its _rideau_!\r\n\r\nI saw _Le Chalet_ here last night, in many respects well played and\r\nsung, and it is a quite charming little opera in its story, only it\r\nrequires an actress of extreme refinement for the main part, and\r\neverybody last night sang too loud. There is no music of any high\r\nquality in it, but the piece is one which, played with such delicacy as\r\nalmost any clever, _well-bred_ girl could put into the heroine's part\r\n(if the audiences would look for acting more than voice), _ought_ to be\r\nextremely delightful to simple persons.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I heard _William Tell_ entirely massacred at the\r\ngreat opera-house at Paris. My belief is they scarcely sang a piece\r\nof pure Rossini all night, but had fitted in modern skimble-skamble\r\ntunes, and quite unspeakably clumsy and common _ballet_. I scarcely\r\ncame away in better humor from the mouthed tediousness of _Gerin_ at\r\nthe _Français_, but they took pains with it, and I suppose it pleased\r\na certain class of audience. The _William Tell_ could please nobody at\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nThe libretto of _Jean de Nivelle_ is very beautiful, and ought to\r\nhave new music written for it. Anything so helplessly tuneless as its\r\npresent music I never heard, except mosquitoes and cicadas.\r\n\r\n                           Ever faithfully yours,\r\n                                             (Signed) J.

RUSKIN.\r\n\r\n  ALEX. MITCHELL, ESQ., Avoch, by Inverness.\r\n\r\nP.S.--You had better, however, ask the Conservatives for a copy of my\r\n_entire_ letters to them.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[178] Of these letters it should be noted that the first was written to\r\nthe President of the Conservative Club upon his requesting Mr. Ruskin\r\nto stand for the Lord Rectorship; the second in answer to a hope that\r\nMr. Ruskin would reconsider the decision he had expressed in his reply;\r\nand the third upon the receipt of a letter explaining what the duties\r\nof the office were. The fourth letter refers to one which dealt with\r\nsome reflections made by the Liberal Club upon the former conduct of\r\ntheir opponents.\r\n\r\n[179] Upon the terms of this letter, which was written in answer to a\r\nquestion whether Mr. Ruskin sympathized with Lord Beaconsfield or with\r\nMr. Gladstone, the reader is referred to the Epilogue. The bracketed\r\nwords were omitted in the _Glasgow Herald_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE.\r\n\r\n                               EPILOGUE.\r\n\r\nI find my immitigable Editor insists on epilogue as well as prologue\r\nfrom his submissive Author; which would have fretted me a little,\r\nsince the last letter of the series appears to me a very pretty and\r\ncomprehensive sum of the matters in the book, had not the day on which,\r\nas Fors would have it, I am to write its last line, brought to my mind\r\nsomething of importance which I forgot to say in the preface; nor will\r\nit perhaps be right to leave wholly without explanation the short\r\nclosing letter to which I have just referred.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed that it was written to the President of the\r\n_Liberal_ party of the Glasgow students, in answer to the question\r\nwhich I felt to be wholly irrelevant to the business in hand, and which\r\ncould not have been answered in anything like official terms with\r\nanything short of a forenoon's work. I gave the answer, therefore,\r\nin my own terms, not in the least petulant, but chosen to convey as\r\nmuch information as I could in the smallest compass; and carrying it\r\naccurately faceted and polished on the angles.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I never, under any conditions of provocation or haste,\r\nwould have said that I hated Liberalism as I did _Mammon_, or Belial,\r\nor Moloch. I chose the milder fiend of Ekron, as the true exponent\r\nand patron of Liberty, the God of Flies; and if my Editor, in final\r\nkindness, can refer the reader to the comparison of the House-fly and\r\nHouse-dog, in (he, and not I, must say where)[180] the letter will have\r\nreceived all the illustration which I am minded to give it. I was only\r\nsurprised that after its publication, of course never intended, though\r\nnever forbidden by me, it passed with so little challenge, and was, on\r\nthe whole, understood as it was meant.\r\n\r\nThe more important matter I have to note in closing, is the security\r\ngiven to the conclusions arrived at in many subjects treated of in\r\nthese letters, in consequence of the breadth of the basis on which\r\nthe reasoning is founded. The multiplicity of subject, and opposite\r\ndirections of investigation, which have so often been alleged against\r\nme, as if sources of weakness, are in reality, as the multiplied\r\nbuttresses of the apse of Amiens, as secure in allied result as they\r\nare opposed in direction. Whatever (for instance) I have urged in\r\neconomy has ten times the force when it is remembered to have been\r\npleaded for by a man loving the splendor, and advising the luxury of\r\nages which overlaid their towers with gold, and their walls with ivory.\r\nNo man, oftener than I, has had cast in his teeth the favorite adage\r\nof the insolent and the feeble--\"ne sutor.\" But it has always been\r\nforgotten by the speakers that, although the proverb might on some\r\noccasions be wisely spoken by an artist to a cobbler, it could never be\r\nwisely spoken by a cobbler to an artist.\r\n\r\n                                                       J.
