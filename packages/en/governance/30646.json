The original equality returns. The mother-web of\r\n     existence starts and rounds up the cycle of human\r\n     affairs.\"--Bachofen.\r\n\r\n     \"Since the advent of civilization, the outgrowth of property has\r\n     been so immense, its forms so diversified, its uses so expanding\r\n     and its management so intelligent in the interests of its owners,\r\n     that it has become, on the part of the people, an unmanageable\r\n     power. The human mind stands bewildered in the presence of its own\r\n     creation. The time will come, nevertheless, when human intelligence\r\n     will rise to the mastery over property, and define the relations of\r\n     the State to the property it protects, as well as the obligations\r\n     and the limits of the rights of its owners. The interests of\r\n     society are paramount to individual interests, and the two must be\r\n     brought into just and harmonious relations. A mere property career\r\n     is not the final destiny of mankind, if progress is to be the law\r\n     of the future as it has been of the past. The time which has passed\r\n     away since civilization began is but a fragment of the past\r\n     duration of man's existence; and but a fragment of the ages yet to\r\n     come. The dissolution of society bids fair to become the\r\n     termination of a career of which property is the end and aim;\r\n     because such a career contains the elements of\r\n     self-destruction.\"--Morgan.\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright 1904, by the New York Labor News Company\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBebel's work, \"Die Frau und der Socialismus,\" rendered in this English\r\nversion with the title \"Woman under Socialism,\" is the best-aimed shot\r\nat the existing social system, both strategically and tactically\r\nconsidered. It is wise tactics and strategy to attack an enemy on his\r\nweakest side. The Woman Question is the weakest link in the capitalist\r\nmail.\r\n\r\nThe workingman, we know, is a defenceless being; but it takes much\r\nsharpening of the intellect to appreciate the fact that \"he cannot speak\r\nfor himself.\" His sex is popularly coupled with the sense of strength.\r\nThe illusion conceals his feebleness, and deprives him of help, often of\r\nsympathy. It is thus even with regard to the child. Proverbially weak\r\nand needing support, the child, nevertheless, is not everywhere a victim\r\nin the existing social order. Only in remote sense does the child of the\r\nruling class suffer. The invocation of the \"Rights of the Child\" leaves\r\nsubstantially untouched the children of the rich. It is otherwise with\r\nwoman. The shot that rips up the wrongs done to her touches a nerve that\r\naches from end to end in the capitalist world. There is no woman,\r\nwhatever her station, but in one way or other is a sufferer, a victim in\r\nmodern society. While upon the woman of the working class the cross of\r\ncapitalist society rests heaviest in all ways, not one of her sisters in\r\nall the upper ranks but bears some share of the burden, or, to be\r\nplainer, of the smudge,--and what is more to the point, they are aware\r\nof it. Accordingly, the invocation of the \"Rights of Woman\" not only\r\nrouses the spirit of the heaviest sufferers under capitalist society,\r\nand thereby adds swing to the blows of the male militants in their\r\nefforts to overthrow the existing order, it also lames the adversary by\r\nraising sympathizers in his own camp, and inciting sedition among his\r\nown retinue. Bebel's exhaustive work, here put in English garb, does\r\nthis double work unerringly.\r\n\r\nI might stop here. The ethic formula commands self-effacement to a\r\ntranslator. More so than well-brought-up children, who should be \"seen\r\nand not heard,\" a translator should, where at all possible, be neither\r\nseen nor heard. That, however, is not always possible. In a work of this\r\nnature, which, to the extent of this one, projects itself into\r\nhypotheses of the future, and even whose premises necessarily branch off\r\ninto fields that are not essentially basic to Socialism, much that is\r\nsaid is, as the author himself announces in his introduction, purely the\r\npersonal opinion of the writer. With these a translator, however, much\r\nin general and fundamental accord, may not always agree. Not agreeing,\r\nhe is in duty bound to modify the ethic formula to the extent of marking\r\nhis exception, lest the general accord, implied in the act of\r\ntranslating, be construed into specific approval of objected-to passages\r\nand views. Mindful of a translator's duties as well as rights, I have\r\nreduced to a small number, and entered in the shape of running footnotes\r\nto the text, the dissent I thought necessary to the passages that to me\r\nseemed most objectionable in matters not related to the main question;\r\nand, as to matters related to the main question, rather than enter\r\ndissent in running footnotes, I have reserved for this place a summary\r\nof my own private views on the family of the future.\r\n\r\nIt is an error to imagine that, in its spiral course, society ever\r\nreturns to where it started from. The spiral never returns upon its own\r\ntrack. Obedient to the law of social evolution, the race often is\r\nforced, in the course of its onward march, to drop much that is good,\r\nbut also much that is bad. The bad, it is hoped, is dropped for all\r\ntime; but the good, when picked up again, never is picked up as\r\noriginally dropped. Between the original dropping and return to its\r\nvicinity along the tracks of the spiral, fresh elements join. These new\r\naccretions so transmute whatever is re-picked up that it is essentially\r\nremodeled. The \"Communism,\" for instance, that the race is now heading\r\ntoward, is, materially, a different article from the \"Communism\" it once\r\nleft behind. We move in an upward spiral. No doubt moral concepts are\r\nthe reflex of material possibilities. But, for one thing, moral concepts\r\nare in themselves a powerful force, often hard to distinguish in their\r\neffect from material ones; and, for another, these material\r\npossibilities unfold material facts, secrets of Nature, that go to\r\nenrich the treasury of science, and quicken the moral sense. Of such\r\nmaterial facts are the discoveries in embryology and kindred branches.\r\nThey reveal the grave fact, previously reckoned with in the matter of\r\nthe breeding of domestic animals, that the act of impregnation is an act\r\nof inoculation. This fact, absolutely material, furnishes a\r\npost-discovered material basis for a pre-surmised moral concept,--the\r\n\"oneness of flesh\" with father and mother. Thus science solidifies a\r\npoetic-moral yearning, once held imprisoned in the benumbing shell of\r\ntheological dogma, and reflects its morality in the poetic expression of\r\nthe monogamic family. The moral, as well as the material, accretions of\r\nthe race's intellect, since it uncoiled out of early Communism, bar, to\r\nmy mind, all prospect,--I would say danger, moral and hygienic,--of\r\npromiscuity, or of anything even remotely approaching that.\r\n\r\nModern society is in a state of decomposition. Institutions, long held\r\nas of all time and for all time, are crumbling. No wonder those bodies\r\nof society that come floating down to us with the prerogatives of\r\n\"teacher\" are seen to-day rushing to opposite extremes. On the matter of\r\n\"Woman\" or \"The Family\" the divergence among our rulers is most marked.\r\nWhile both extremes cling like shipwrecked mariners to the water-logged\r\ntheory of private ownership in the means of production, the one extreme,\r\nrepresented by the Roman Catholic church-machine, is seen to recede ever\r\nfurther back within the shell of orthodoxy, and the other extreme,\r\nrepresented by the pseudo-Darwinians, is seen to fly into ever wilder\r\nflights of heterodoxy on the matter of \"Marriage and Divorce.\" Agreed,\r\nboth, in keeping woman nailed to the cross of a now perverse social\r\nsystem, the former seeks to assuage her agony with the benumbing balm of\r\nresignation, the latter to relieve her torture with the blister of\r\nlibertinage.\r\n\r\nBetween these two extremes stand the gathering forces of revolution that\r\nare taking shape in the militant Socialist Movement. Opinion among these\r\nforces, while it cannot be said to clash, takes on a variety of\r\nshades--as needs will happen among men, who, at one on basic principles,\r\non the material substructure of institutional superstructure, cannot\r\nbut yield to the allurements of speculative thought on matters as yet\r\nhidden in the future, and below the horizon. For one, I hold there is as\r\nlittle ground for rejecting monogamy, by reason of the taint that clings\r\nto its inception, as there would be ground for rejecting co-operation,\r\nby reason of the like taint that accompanied its rise, and also clings\r\nto its development. For one, I hold that the smut of capitalist\r\nconditions, that to-day clings to monogamy, is as avoidable an\r\n\"incident\" in the evolutionary process as are the iniquities of\r\ncapitalism that to-day are found the accompaniment of co-operative\r\nlabor;--and the further the parallel is pursued through the many\r\nramifications of the subject, the closer will it be discovered to hold.\r\nFor one, I hold that the monogamous family--bruised and wounded in the\r\ncruel rough-and-tumble of modern society, where, with few favored\r\nexceptions of highest type, male creation is held down, physically,\r\nmentally and morally, to the brutalizing level of the brute, forced to\r\ngrub and grub for bare existence, or, which amounts to the same, to\r\nscheme and scheme in order to avoid being forced so to grub and\r\ngrub--will have its wounds staunched, its bruises healed, and, ennobled\r\nby the slowly acquired moral forces of conjugal, paternal and filial\r\naffection, bloom under Socialism into a lever of mighty power for the\r\nmoral and physical elevation of the race.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, however the genius of our descendants may shape matters on\r\nthis head, one thing is certain: Woman--the race's mothers, wives,\r\nsisters, daughters--long sinned against through unnumbered\r\ngenerations--is about to be atoned to. All the moral and intellectual\r\nforces of the age are seen obviously converging to that point. It will\r\nbe the crowning work of Militant Socialism, like a mightier Perseus, to\r\nstrike the shackles from the chained Andromeda of modern society, Woman,\r\nand raise her to the dignity of her sex.\r\n\r\nDANIEL DE LEON.\r\n\r\nNew York, June 21, 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATOR'S PREFACE                                                 iii\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION                                                           1\r\n\r\nWOMAN IN THE PAST--\r\n  Chapter I--Before Christianity                                       9\r\n  Chapter II--Under Christianity                                      47\r\n\r\nWOMAN IN THE PRESENT--\r\n  Chapter I--Sexual Instinct, Wedlock, Checks and Obstructions\r\n    to Marriage                                                       79\r\n  Chapter II--Further Checks and Obstructions to Marriage, Numerical\r\n    Proportion of the Sexes, Its Causes and Effects                  118\r\n  Chapter III--Prostitution a Necessary Social Institution of\r\n    the Capitalist World                                             146\r\n  Chapter IV--Woman's Position as a Breadwinner, Her Intellectual\r\n    Faculties, Darwinism and the Condition of Society                167\r\n  Chapter V--Woman's Civic and Political Status                      216\r\n  Chapter VI--The State and Society                                  235\r\n  Chapter VII--The Socialization of Society                          272\r\n\r\nWOMAN IN THE FUTURE                                                  343\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONALITY                                                     350\r\n\r\nPOPULATION AND OVER-POPULATION                                       355\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION                                                           372\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe live in the age of a great social Revolution, that every day makes\r\nfurther progress. A growingly powerful intellectual stir and unrest is\r\nnoticeable in all the layers of society; and the movement pushes towards\r\ndeep-reaching changes. All feel that the ground they stand on shakes. A\r\nnumber of questions have risen; they occupy the attention of ever\r\nwidening circles; and discussion runs high on their solution. One of the\r\nmost important of these, one that pushes itself ever more to the fore,\r\nis the so-called \"Woman Question.\"\r\n\r\nThe question concerns the position that woman should occupy in our\r\nsocial organism; how she may unfold her powers and faculties in all\r\ndirections, to the end that she become a complete and useful member of\r\nhuman society, enjoying equal rights with all. From our view-point, this\r\nquestion coincides with that other:--what shape and organization human\r\nsociety must assume to the end that, in the place of oppression,\r\nexploitation, want and misery in manifold forms, there shall be physical\r\nand social health on the part of the individual and of society. To us,\r\naccordingly, the Woman Question is only one of the aspects of the\r\ngeneral Social Question, which is now filling all heads, which is\r\nsetting all minds in motion and which, consequently, can find its final\r\nsolution only in the abolition of the existing social contradictions,\r\nand of the evils which flow from them.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is necessary to treat the so-called Woman Question\r\nseparately. On the one hand the question, What was the former position\r\nof woman, what is it to-day, and what will it be in the future?\r\nconcerns, in Europe at least, the larger section of society, seeing that\r\nhere the female sex constitutes the larger part of the population. On\r\nthe other hand, the prevailing notions, regarding the development that\r\nwoman has undergone in the course of centuries, correspond so little\r\nwith the facts, that light upon the subject becomes a necessity for the\r\nunderstanding of the present and of the future. Indeed, a good part of\r\nthe prejudices with which the ever-growing movement is looked upon in\r\nvarious circles--and not least in the circle of woman herself--rests\r\nupon lack of knowledge and lack of understanding. Many are heard\r\nclaiming there is no Woman Question, because the position that woman\r\nformerly occupied, occupies to-day and will in the future continue to\r\noccupy, is determined by her \"natural calling,\" which destines her for\r\nwife and mother, and limits her to the sphere of the home. Accordingly,\r\nwhatever lies beyond her four walls, or is not closely and obviously\r\nconnected with her household duties, concerns her not.\r\n\r\nOn the Woman Question, the same as on the general Social Question, in\r\nwhich the position of the working class in society plays the chief role,\r\nopposing parties stand arrayed against each other. One party, that which\r\nwould leave everything as it is, have their answer ready at hand; they\r\nimagine the matter is settled with referring woman to her \"natural\r\ncalling.\" They forget that, to-day, for reasons later to be developed,\r\nmillions of women are wholly unable to fill that \"natural calling,\" so\r\nmuch insisted upon in their behalf, of householders, breeders and nurses\r\nof children; and that, with other millions, the \"calling\" has suffered\r\nextensive shipwreck--wedlock, to them, having turned into a yoke and\r\ninto slavery, compelling them to drag along their lives in misery and\r\nwant. Of course, this fact concerns those \"wise men\" as little as that\r\nother fact, that unnumbered millions of women, engaged in the several\r\npursuits of life, are compelled, often in unnatural ways, and far beyond\r\nthe measure of their strength, to wear themselves out in order to eke\r\nout a meager existence. At this unpleasant fact those \"wise men\" stuff\r\ntheir ears, and they shut their eyes with as much violence as they do\r\nbefore the misery of the working class, consoling themselves and others\r\nwith \"it has ever been, and will ever remain so.\" That woman has the\r\nright to share the conquests of civilization achieved in our days; to\r\nutilize these to the easing and improving of her condition; and to\r\ndevelop her mental and physical faculties, and turn them to advantage as\r\nwell as man,--they will none of that. Are they told that woman must also\r\nbe economically, in order to be physically and intellectually free, to\r\nthe end that she no longer depend upon the \"good-will\" and the \"mercy\"\r\nof the other sex?--forthwith their patience is at end; their anger is\r\nkindled; and there follows a torrent of violent charges against the\r\n\"craziness of the times,\" and the \"insane emancipational efforts.\"\r\n\r\nThese are the Philistines of male and female sex, incapable of finding\r\ntheir way out of the narrow circle of their prejudices. It is the breed\r\nof the owls, to be found everywhere when day is breaking, and they cry\r\nout in affright when a ray of light falls upon their comfortable\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nAnother element among the adversaries of the movement cannot shut its\r\neyes before the glaring facts. This element admits that there was hardly\r\na time when a larger number of women found themselves in so\r\nunsatisfactory a condition as to-day, relatively to the degree of\r\ngeneral civilization; and they admit that it is therefore necessary to\r\ninquire how the condition of woman can be improved, in so far as she\r\nremains dependent upon herself. To this portion of our adversaries, the\r\nSocial Question seems solved for those women who have entered the haven\r\nof matrimony.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with their views, this element demands that, to unmarried\r\nwoman, at least, all fields of work, for which her strength and\r\nfaculties are adequate, shall be opened, to the end that she may enter\r\nthe competitive field for work with man. A small set goes even further,\r\nand demands that competition for work be not limited to the field of the\r\nlower occupations, but should also extend higher, to the professions, to\r\nthe field of art and science. This set demands the admission of woman to\r\nall the higher institutions of learning, namely, the universities, which\r\nin many countries are still closed to her. Their admission is advocated\r\nto the classes of several branches of study, to the medical profession,\r\nto the civil service (the Post Office, telegraph and railroad offices),\r\nfor which they consider women peculiarly adapted;, and they point to the\r\npractical results that have been attained, especially in the United\r\nStates, through the employment of woman. The one and the other also make\r\nthe demand that political rights be conferred upon woman. Woman, they\r\nadmit, is human and a member of the State, as well as man: legislation,\r\nuntil now in the exclusive control of man, proves that he exploited the\r\nprivilege to his own exclusive benefit, and kept woman in every respect\r\nunder guardianship, a thing to be henceforth prevented.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that the efforts here roughly sketched, do not reach\r\nbeyond the frame-work of the existing social order. The question never\r\nis put whether, these objects being attained, any real and thoroughgoing\r\nimprovement in the condition of woman will have been achieved. Standing\r\non the ground of bourgeois, that is, of the capitalist social order, the\r\nfull social equality of man and woman is considered the solution of the\r\nquestion. These folks are not aware, or they slide over the fact that,\r\nin so far as the unrestricted admission of woman to the industrial\r\noccupations is concerned, the object has already been actually attained,\r\nand it meets with the strongest support on the part of the ruling class,\r\nwho as will be shown further on, find therein their own interest. Under\r\nexisting conditions, the admission of women to all industrial\r\noccupations can have for its only effect that the competitive struggle\r\nof the working people become ever sharper, and rage ever mere fiercely.\r\nHence the inevitable result,--the lowering of incomes for female and\r\nmale labor, whether this income be in the form of wage or salary.\r\n\r\nThat this solution cannot be the right one is clear. The full civic\r\nequality of woman is, however, not merely the ultimate object of the\r\nmen, who, planted upon the existing social order, favor the efforts in\r\nbehalf of woman. It is also recognized by the female bourgeois, active\r\nin the Woman Movement. These, together with the males of their mental\r\nstamp, stand, accordingly, with their demands in contrast to the larger\r\nportion of the men, who oppose them, partly out of old-fogy narrowness,\r\npartly also--in so far as the admission of woman to the higher studies\r\nand the better-paid public positions is concerned--out of mean\r\nselfishness, out of fear of competition. A difference in principle,\r\nhowever, a class difference, such as there is between the working and\r\nthe capitalist class, does not exist between these two sets of male and\r\nfemale citizens.\r\n\r\nLet the by no means impossible case be imagined that the representatives\r\nof the movement for the civic rights of woman carry through all their\r\ndemands for placing woman upon an equal footing with man. What then?\r\nNeither the slavery, which modern marriage amounts to for numberless\r\nwomen, nor prostitution, nor the material dependence of the large\r\nmajority of married women upon their marital lords, would thereby be\r\nremoved. For the large majority of women it is, indeed, immaterial\r\nwhether a thousand, or ten thousand, members of their own sex, belonging\r\nto the more favored strata of society, land in the higher branches of\r\nlearning, the practice of medicine, a scientific career, or some\r\ngovernment office. Nothing is thereby changed in the total condition of\r\nthe sex.\r\n\r\nThe mass of the female sex suffers in two respects: On the one side\r\nwoman suffers from economic and social dependence upon man. True enough,\r\nthis dependence may be alleviated by formally placing her upon an\r\nequality before the law, and in point of rights; but the dependence is\r\nnot removed. On the other side, woman suffers from the economic\r\ndependence that woman in general, the working-woman in particular, finds\r\nherself in, along with the workingman.\r\n\r\nEvidently, all women, without difference of social standing, have an\r\ninterest--as the sex that in the course of social development has been\r\noppressed, and ruled, and defiled by man--in removing such a state of\r\nthings, and must exert themselves to change it, in so far as it can be\r\nchanged by changes in the laws and institutions within the frame-work of\r\nthe present social order. But the enormous majority of women are\r\nfurthermore interested in the most lively manner in that the existing\r\nState and social order be radically transformed, to the end that both\r\nwage-slavery, under which the working-women deeply pine, and sex\r\nslavery, which is intimately connected with our property and industrial\r\nsystems, be wiped out.\r\n\r\nThe larger portion by far of the women in society, engaged in the\r\nmovement for the emancipation of woman, do not see the necessity for\r\nsuch a radical change. Influenced by their privileged social standing,\r\nthey see in the more far-reaching working-women's movement dangers, not\r\ninfrequently abhorrent aims, which they feel constrained to ignore,\r\neventually even to resist. The class-antagonism, that in the general\r\nsocial movement rages between the capitalist and the working class, and\r\nwhich, with the ripening of conditions, grows sharper and more\r\npronounced, turns up likewise on the surface of the Woman's Movement;\r\nand it finds its corresponding expression in the aims and tactics of\r\nthose engaged in it.\r\n\r\nAll the same, the hostile sisters have, to a far greater extent than the\r\nmale population--split up as the latter is in the class struggle--a\r\nnumber of points of contact, on which they can, although marching\r\nseparately, strike jointly. This happens on all the fields, on which the\r\nquestion is the equality of woman with man, within modern society. This\r\nembraces the participation of woman in all the fields of human activity,\r\nfor which her strength and faculties are fit; and also her full civil\r\nand political equality with man. These are very important, and as will\r\nbe shown further on, very extensive fields. Besides all this the working\r\nwoman has also a special interest in doing battle hand in hand with the\r\nmale portion of the working class, for all the means and institutions\r\nthat may protect the working woman from physical and moral degeneration,\r\nand which promise to secure to her the vitality and fitness necessary\r\nfor motherhood and for the education of children. Furthermore, as\r\nalready indicated, it is the part of the working-woman to make common\r\ncause with the male members of her class and of her lot in the struggle\r\nfor a radical transformation of society, looking to the establishment of\r\nsuch conditions as may make possible the real economic and spiritual\r\nindependence of both sexes, by means of social institutions that afford\r\nto all a full share in the enjoyment of all the conquests of\r\ncivilization made by mankind.\r\n\r\nThe goal, accordingly, is not merely the realization of the equal rights\r\nof woman with man within present society, as is aimed at by the\r\nbourgeois woman emancipationists. It lies beyond,--the removal of all\r\nimpediments that make man dependent upon man; and, consequently, one sex\r\nupon the other. Accordingly, this solution of the Woman Question\r\ncoincides completely with the solution of the Social Question. It\r\nfollows that he who aims at the solution of the Woman Question to its\r\nfull extent, is necessarily bound to go hand in hand with those who have\r\ninscribed upon their banner the solution of the Social Question as a\r\nquestion of civilization for the whole human race. These are the\r\nSocialists, that is, the Social Democracy.\r\n\r\nOf all existing parties in Germany, the Social Democratic Party is the\r\nonly one which has placed in its programme the full equality of woman,\r\nher emancipation from all dependence and oppression. And the party has\r\ndone so, not for agitational reasons, but out of necessity, out of\r\nprinciple. _There can be no emancipation of humanity without the social\r\nindependence and equality of the sexes._\r\n\r\nUp to this point all Socialists are likely to agree with the\r\npresentation made of fundamental principles. But the same cannot be said\r\non the subject of the manner in which we portray the ultimate aims to\r\nourselves; how the measures and special institutions shall be shaped\r\nwhich will establish the aimed-at independence and equality of all\r\nmembers of the sexes, consequently that of man and woman also.\r\n\r\nThe moment the field of the known is abandoned, and one launches out\r\ninto pictures of future forms, a wide field is opened for speculation.\r\nDifferences of opinion start over that which is probable or not\r\nprobable. That which in that direction is set forth in this book can,\r\naccordingly, be taken only as the personal opinion of the author\r\nhimself; possible attacks must be directed against him only; only he is\r\nresponsible.\r\n\r\nAttacks that are objective, and are honestly meant, will be welcome to\r\nus. Attacks that violate truth in the presentation of the contents of\r\nthis book, or that rest upon false premises we shall ignore. For the\r\nrest, in the following pages all conclusions, even the extremest, will\r\nbe drawn, which, the facts being verified, the results attained may\r\nwarrant. Freedom from prejudice is the first condition for the\r\nrecognition of truth. Only the unrestricted utterance of that which is,\r\nand must be, leads to the goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nWOMAN IN THE PAST\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nBEFORE CHRISTIANITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWoman and the workingman have, since old, had this in\r\ncommon--_oppression_. The forms of oppression have suffered changes in\r\nthe course of time, and in various countries. But the oppression always\r\nremained. Many a time and oft, in the course of the ages, did the\r\noppressed become conscious of their oppression; and such conscious\r\nknowledge of their condition did bring on changes and reliefs.\r\nNevertheless, a knowledge, that grasped the actual feature of the\r\noppression by grasping its causes, is, with woman as with the\r\nworkingman, the fruit of our own days. The actual feature of society,\r\nand of the laws that lie at the bottom of its development, had first to\r\nbe known, before a general movement could take place for the removal of\r\nconditions, recognized as oppressive and unjust. The breadth and\r\nintensity of such a movement depends, however, upon the measure of the\r\nunderstanding prevalent among the suffering social layers and circles,\r\nand upon the measure of freedom of motion that they enjoy. In both\r\nrespects, woman stands, through custom and education, as well as the\r\nfreedom allowed her by law, behind the workingman. To this, another\r\ncircumstance is added. Conditions, lasting through a long series of\r\ngenerations, finally grow into custom; heredity and education then cause\r\nsuch conditions to appear on both sides as \"natural.\" Hence it comes\r\nthat, even to-day, woman in particular, accepts her subordinate position\r\nas a matter of course. It is no easy matter to make her understand that\r\nthat position is unworthy, and that it is her duty to endeavor to become\r\na member of society, equal-righted with, and in every sense a peer of\r\nman.\r\n\r\nHowever much in common woman may be shown to have with the workingman,\r\nshe leads him in one thing:--_Woman was the first human being to come\r\ninto bondage: she was a slave before the male slave existed._\r\n\r\nAll social dependence and oppression has its roots in the _economic\r\ndependence_ of the oppressed upon the oppressor. In this condition woman\r\nfinds herself, from an early day down to our own. The history of the\r\ndevelopment of human society proves the fact everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of the history of this development is, however,\r\ncomparatively new. As little as the myth of the Creation of the\r\nWorld--as taught us by the Bible--can be upheld in sight of the\r\ninvestigations of geographers and, scientists, grounded as these\r\ninvestigations are upon unquestionable and innumerable facts, just so\r\nuntenable has its myth proved concerning the creation and evolution of\r\nman. True enough, as yet the veil is far from being lifted from all the\r\nsub-departments of this historical development of mankind; over many, on\r\nwhich already light has been shed, differences of opinion still exist\r\namong the investigators on the meaning and connection of this or that\r\nfact; nevertheless, on the whole, there is agreement and clearness. It\r\nis established that man did not, like the first human couple of the\r\nBible, make his first appearance on earth in an advanced stage of\r\ncivilization. He reached that plane only in the course of endlessly long\r\nlapses of time, after he had gradually freed himself from purely animal\r\nconditions, and had experienced long terms of development, in the course\r\nof which his social as well as his sexual relations--the relations\r\nbetween man and woman--had undergone a great variety of changes.\r\n\r\nThe favorite phrase--a phrase that the ignorant or impostors daily smite\r\nour ears with on the subject of the relations between man and woman, and\r\nbetween the poor and the rich--\"it always has been so,\" and the\r\nconclusion drawn therefrom--\"it will always be so,\" _is in every sense\r\nof the word false, superficial and trumped-up_.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this work a cursory presentation of the relations\r\nbetween the sexes, since primitive society, is of special importance. It\r\nis so because it can thereby be proved that, seeing that these relations\r\nhave materially changed in the previous course of human development, and\r\nthat the changes have taken place in even step with the existing systems\r\nof production, on the one hand, and of the distribution of the product\r\nof labor, on the other, it is natural and goes without saying that,\r\nalong with further changes and revolutions in the system of production\r\nand distribution, _the relations between the sexes are bound to change\r\nagain_. Nothing is \"eternal,\" either in nature or in human life; eternal\r\nonly is change and interchange.\r\n\r\nAs far back as one may go in the development of human society, the horde\r\nis found as the first human community. True enough, Honeger mentions in\r\nhis \"General History of Civilization\" that even to-day in the little\r\nexplored interior of the island of Borneo, there are wild people, living\r\nseparately; and Huegel likewise maintains that, in the wild mountain\r\nregions of India, human couples have been discovered living alone, and\r\nwho, ape-like, fled to the trees as soon as they were met; but there is\r\nno further knowledge on the subject. If verified, these claims would\r\nonly confirm the previous superstition and hypothesis concerning the\r\ndevelopment of the human race. The probability is that, wherever human\r\nbeings sprang up, there were, at first, single couples. Certain it is,\r\nhowever, that so soon as a larger number of beings existed, descended\r\nfrom a common parent stock, they held together in hordes in order that,\r\nby their joint efforts, they might, first of all, gain their still very\r\nprimitive conditions of life and support, as well as to protect\r\nthemselves against their common enemies, wild animals. Growing numbers\r\nand increased difficulties in securing subsistence, which originally\r\nconsisted in roots, berries and fruit, first led to the splitting up or\r\nsegmentation of the hordes, and to the search for new habitats.\r\n\r\nThis almost animal-like state, of which we have no further credible\r\nantiquarian proofs, undoubtedly once existed, judging from all that we\r\nhave learned concerning the several grades of civilization of wild\r\npeoples still living, or known to have lived within historic times. Man\r\ndid not, upon the call of a Creator, step ready-made into existence as a\r\nhigher product of civilization. It was otherwise. He has had to pass\r\nthrough the most varied stages in an endlessly long and slow process of\r\ndevelopment. Only via ebbing and flowing periods of civilization, and in\r\nconstant differentiation with his fellows in all parts of the world, and\r\nin all zones, did he gradually climb up to his present height.\r\n\r\nIndeed, while in one section of the earth's surface great peoples and\r\nnations belong to the most advanced stages of civilization, other\r\npeoples are found in different sections standing on the greatest variety\r\nof gradations in development. They thus present to us a picture of our\r\nown past history; and they point to the road which mankind traversed in\r\nthe course of its development. If but certain common and generally\r\naccepted data are established, that may serve everywhere as sign-posts\r\nto guide investigation, a mass of facts will follow, throwing a wholly\r\nnew light upon the relations of man in the past and the present. A\r\nnumber of social phenomena--unintelligible to us to-day, and attacked by\r\nsuperficial judges as nonsensical, not infrequently even as\r\n\"immoral\"--will become clear and natural. A material lifting of the\r\nveil, formerly spread over the history of the development of our race,\r\nhas been effected through the investigations made, since Bachofen, by a\r\nconsiderable number of scientists, like Tylor, MacLennan, Lubbock and\r\nothers. Prominently among the men who joined these was Morgan, with his\r\nfundamental work, that Frederick Engels further substantiated and\r\nsupplemented with a series of historical facts, economic and political\r\nin their nature, and that, more recently, has been partly confirmed and\r\npartly rectified by Cunow.[1]\r\n\r\nBy means of these expositions--especially as clearly and lucidly\r\npresented by Frederick Engels, in his support of Morgan's excellent and\r\nfundamental work,--a mass of light is shed upon hitherto unintelligible,\r\npartly seemingly contradictory phenomena in the life of the races and\r\ntribes of both high and low degree of culture. Only now do we gain an\r\ninsight into the structure that human society raised in the course of\r\ntime. According thereto, our former views of marriage, the family, the\r\ncommunity, the State, rested upon notions that were wholly false; so\r\nfalse that they turn out to be no better than a fancy-picture, wholly\r\ndevoid of foundation in fact.\r\n\r\nAll that is said and proved about marriage, the family, the community\r\nand the State holds good especially with regard to woman, who, in the\r\nvarious periods of development did likewise fill a place, that differs\r\nmaterially from the \"eternal,\" imputed to her.\r\n\r\nMorgan, whom Engels agrees with in this, divides the history of mankind\r\ninto three main epochs:--savagery, barbarism and civilization. Each of\r\nthe two first ones he again divides into an under, a middle and an upper\r\nperiod, each distinguishing itself from the other by certain innovations\r\nand improvements, predicated in each instance upon the control over\r\nsubsistence. Morgan, accordingly, exactly in the sense of the\r\nmaterialist conception of history, as established by Karl Marx and\r\nFrederick Engels,--perceives the leading characteristics in the\r\ndevelopment of society to be the changes that, in given epochs, the\r\nconditions of life are molded into; and he perceives the changes to be\r\ndue to the progress made in the process of production, that is to say,\r\nin the procurement of subsistence. Summed up in a few words, the lower\r\nperiod of savagery constitutes the infancy of the human race, during\r\nwhich the race, partly living in trees, is mainly nourished by fruits\r\nand roots, and during which articulate language takes its inception. The\r\nmiddle period of savagery commences with the acquisition of a fish\r\nsubsistence, and the use of fire. The construction of weapons begins; at\r\nfirst the club and spear, fashioned out of wood and stone. Thereby also\r\nbegins the chase, and probably also war with contiguous hordes for the\r\nsources of food, for domiciles and hunting grounds. At this stage\r\nappears also cannibalism, still practiced to-day by some tribes and\r\npeoples of Africa, Australia and Polynesia. The upper period of savagery\r\nis characterized by the perfection of weapons to the point of the bow\r\nand arrow; finger weaving, the making of baskets out of filaments of\r\nbark, the fashioning of sharpened stone tools have here their start, and\r\nthereby begins also the preparation of wood for the building of boats\r\nand huts. The form of life has accordingly, become many-sided. The\r\nexisting tools and implements, needed for the control of a plentiful\r\nfood supply, make possible the subsistance of larger communities.\r\n\r\nThe lower period of barbarism Morgan starts with the invention of the\r\nart of pottery. The taming and domestication of animals, and, along with\r\nthat, the production of meat and milk, and the preparation of hides,\r\nhorns and hair for various purposes of use, have here their start. Hand\r\nin hand therewith begins the cultivation of plants,--in the West of\r\nmaize, in the East of almost all known cereals, maize excepted. The\r\nmiddle period of barbarism shows us, in the East, the ever more\r\nextensive domestication of animals; in the West, the cultivation of\r\nmaize and plants by irrigation. Here also begins the use of adobe-bricks\r\nand of stone for house-building. The domestication of animals promotes\r\nthe rearing of herds, and leads to the pastoral life. The necessity of\r\nlarger quantities of food for men and beasts leads to field agriculture.\r\nAlong therewith, the people begin to be localized; food increases in\r\nquantity and diversity, and gradually cannibalism disappears.\r\n\r\nThe upper period of barbarism begins finally with the smelting of iron\r\nore, and the discovery of the phonetic alphabet. The iron plow-share is\r\ninvented, making possible agriculture on a larger scale; the iron axe\r\nand spade are brought into requisition, making easy the clearing of the\r\nforests. With the preparation of iron, a number of fields are opened to\r\nactivity, imparting to life a new form. Iron utensils help the building\r\nof houses, vessels and weapons; with the preparation of metals arises\r\nskilled handwork, a more perfect knowledge of weapons, and the building\r\nof walled cities. Architecture, as an art, then rises; mythology, poetry\r\nand history find support and expansion in the discovery of the phonetic\r\nalphabet.\r\n\r\nThe Orient and the countries bordering on the Mediterranean,\r\nparticularly Egypt, Greece and Italy, are those in which the last\r\nsketched stage of life principally unfolded; and it laid the foundation\r\nfor the social transformation that in the course of time exercised a\r\ndetermining influence on the social development of Europe and of the\r\nwhole earth.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, the social development of the human race through\r\nthe periods of savagery and barbarism had also its peculiar sexual and\r\nsocial relations, differing materially from those of later days.\r\n\r\nBachofen and Morgan have traced these relations by means of thorough\r\ninvestigations. Bachofen, by studying closely all ancient and modern\r\nwritings, so as to arrive at the nature of phenomena that appear\r\nsingular to us in mythology, folk-lore and historic tradition, and that,\r\nnevertheless, seem to be re-echoed in incidents and events of later\r\ndays, occasionally even of our own. Morgan, by spending decades of his\r\nlife among the Iroquois Indians, located in the State of New York, and\r\nthereby making observations, through which he gained new and unexpected\r\ninsight into the system of life, the family and the relationships of the\r\nsaid Indian tribe, and, based upon which, observations made elsewhere,\r\nfirst received their correct interpretation and explanation.\r\n\r\nBoth of them, Bachofen and Morgan, discovered, each along his own line\r\nof research, the latter, however, far more clearly than the former, that\r\nthe relations of the sexes during primitive times of human development\r\nwere substantially different from the relations existing in historic\r\ndays, and among the modern civilized peoples. Especially did Morgan\r\ndiscover--thanks to his many years' sojourn among the Iroquois of North\r\nAmerica, and grounded upon comparative studies, which he was moved to by\r\nthat which he there observed,--that all the existing races, that are\r\nstill materially backward, possess systems of family and consanguinity\r\nthat are totally different from ours, but must be similar to those once\r\nprevalent among all races during the previous stages of civilization.\r\n\r\nMorgan found, at the time that he lived among the Iroquois, that among\r\nthem there existed a system of monogamy, easily dissolvable by both\r\nparties, and which he designated as the \"pairing family.\" He also found\r\nthat the terms for the degrees of consanguinity--father, mother, son,\r\ndaughter, brother, sister--although, according to our conception, there\r\ncan be no doubt as to their application, were there, nevertheless,\r\napplied in quite different sense. The Iroquois calls not only his own\r\nchildren \"sons\" and \"daughters,\" but also the children of all his\r\nbrothers; and their children call him \"father.\" Conversely, the female\r\nIroquois calls not only her own children \"sons\" and \"daughters,\" but all\r\nthose of her sisters, and likewise do their children call her \"mother.\"\r\nOn the other hand, she calls the children of her brothers \"nephews\" and\r\n\"nieces,\" and these call her \"aunt.\" The children of brothers call one\r\nanother \"brothers\" and \"sisters;\" likewise the children of sisters.\r\nFinally, the children of a woman and those of her brother call one\r\nanother \"cousins.\" Accordingly, the singular spectacle is seen of the\r\nterms of relationship going, not as in our sense, by the degree of\r\nconsanguinity, but by the sex of the relative.\r\n\r\nThis system of relationship is in full force, not only among all the\r\nAmerican Indians, as well as among the aborigines of India, the tribes\r\nof Dekan and the Gaura tribes of Hindostan, but, according to the\r\ninvestigations that have taken place since Bachofen, similar conditions\r\nmust have existed everywhere in primitive times, as they still exist\r\nto-day among many peoples of Upper and Further Asia, Africa and\r\nAustralia. When, in connection with these investigations and established\r\nfacts, the investigation will be everywhere taken up on the sex and\r\nfamily relations of wild and barbarous nations still living, then will\r\nthe fact transpire that, what Bachofen still confusedly found among\r\nnumerous peoples of antiquity, and rather surmised than otherwise; what\r\nMorgan found among the Iroquois; what Cunow found among the\r\nAustral-Negros, are but social and sexual formations, that constitute\r\nthe _groundwork of human development for all the peoples of the earth_.\r\n\r\nThe investigations of Morgan bring, moreover, other interesting facts to\r\nlight. Although the \"pairing family\" of the Iroquois starts in\r\ninsolvable contradiction with the terms of consanguinity in use among\r\nthem, it turns out that, as late as the first half of the 19th Century,\r\nthere existed on the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii) a family-form that\r\nactually tallied with that which, among the Iroquois, existed in name\r\nonly. But the system of consanguinity, in force in Hawaii, failed, in\r\nturn, to tally with the family-form actually in existence there. It\r\nreferred to an older family-form, one still more primitive, but no\r\nlonger extant. There, all the children of brothers and sisters, without\r\nexception, were \"brothers\" and \"sisters.\" Accordingly, they were not\r\nconsidered the common children of their mothers and of the sisters of\r\nthese, or of their fathers and of the brothers of these, but of all the\r\nbrothers and sisters of their parents, without distinction. The Hawaiian\r\nsystem of consanguinity corresponded, accordingly, with a stage of\r\ndevelopment that was lower than the family-form still actually in\r\nexistence. Hence transpires the curious fact that, in Hawaii, as with\r\nthe Indians of North America, two distinct systems of consanguinity are,\r\nor rather, at a time, were in vogue, which no longer tallied with actual\r\nconditions, but were both overtaken by a higher state. On this head\r\nMorgan says: \"The family represents an active principle. It is never\r\nstationary, but advances from a lower to a higher form as society\r\nadvances from a lower to a higher condition, and finally passes out of\r\none form into another of higher grade. Systems of consanguinity, on the\r\ncontrary, are passive; recording the progress made by the family at long\r\nintervals apart, and only changing radically when the family has\r\nradically changed.\"\r\n\r\nThe theory,--even to-day generally considered conclusive, and which is\r\nstubbornly upheld as irrefutable by the representatives of the _status\r\nquo_--to the effect that the existing family-form has existed since time\r\nimmemorial, and, lest the whole social fabric be put in jeopardy, must\r\ncontinue to exist forever, turned out, accordingly, after these\r\ndiscoveries of the investigators, to be wholly false and untenable. The\r\nform, under which the relations of the sexes appear and the situation of\r\nthe family is raised, depends rather upon the social conditions, upon\r\nthe manner in which man controls his subsistence. The form changes with\r\nthe changed degree of culture at each given period.\r\n\r\nThe study of primitive history leaves now no room for doubt that, at the\r\nlowest grades of human development, the relation of the sexes is totally\r\ndifferent from that of latter times, and that a state of things resulted\r\ntherefrom, which, looked at with modern eyes, appears as monstrous, and\r\nas a sink of immorality. Nevertheless, as each social stage of human\r\ndevelopment has its own conditions of production, so likewise has each\r\nits own code of morals, which is but the _reflection of the social\r\ncondition_. That is moral which is usage; and that, in turn, is usage\r\nwhich corresponds with the innermost being, i. e., the needs of a given\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nMorgan reaches the conclusion that, at the lower period of savagery,\r\nthere was sexual intercourse between the several grades or generations,\r\nevery woman belonging to every man, and every man to every woman,--in\r\nother words, promiscuity. All men live in polygamy and all women in\r\npolyandry. There is a general community of women and of men, but also a\r\ncommunity of children, Strábo reports (sixty-six years before our\r\nreckoning) that, among the Arabians, brothers cohabited with sisters and\r\nwith their own mother. On any route other than that of incest, the\r\nincrease of population is nowhere possible, if, as alleged in the Bible\r\nalso, descent from one couple is granted. The Bible itself contradicts\r\nitself on this delicate point. It is stated there that Cain, after he\r\nhad murdered his brother Abel, took a wife of another people. Whence\r\ncame that other people? The theory of promiscuity in primitive times,\r\nthat is to say, that the horde was endogamous, that sexual intercourse\r\nwas indiscriminate, is furthermore supported by the Hindoo myth,\r\naccording to which Brahma married his own daughter Saravasti. The same\r\nmyth turns up again among the Egyptians and the northern Edda. The\r\nEgyptian god Ammon was the spouse of his own mother, and boasted of it.\r\nOdin, according to the Edda, was the mate of his own daughter Frigga.[2]\r\nMorgan proceeds from the principle that, from the state of promiscuity,\r\nsoon a higher form of sexual intercourse took shape. He designates this\r\nthe consanguine family. Here the groups, that stand in sexual relation,\r\nare separated by grades or generations, so that grandfathers and\r\ngrandmothers, within an age group, are husbands and wives. Their\r\nchildren, likewise, constitute a group of common couples; likewise the\r\nchildren of these, so soon as they have reached the requisite age.\r\nAccordingly, in contrast with the sex relations of the rawest period, in\r\nwhich promiscuity of sexes exists without distinction of age, now one\r\ngeneration is excluded from sexual intercourse with another. Sexual\r\nintercourse, however, exists between brothers and sisters, male and\r\nfemale cousins of the first, second and third remove. All of these\r\ntogether are brothers and sisters, but towards one another, they are all\r\nhusbands and wives. This family-form corresponds with the system of\r\nconsanguinity that still existed in Hawaii during the first part of the\r\n19th Century, in name only, but no longer in fact. On the other hand,\r\naccording to the American Indian system of consanguinity, a brother and\r\nsister can never be the father and mother of the same child--a thing,\r\nhowever, permissible in the Hawaiian family system. Probably the\r\nconsanguine family was the state that, at the time of Herodotus, existed\r\namong the Massagetae, on the subject of which he reports: \"Each man\r\nreceived a wife, but all were allowed to use her.\" And he continues: \"At\r\nany time a man desires a woman, he hangs his quiver in front of his\r\nwagon, and cohabits, unconcerned, with her.... He at the same time\r\nsticks his staff into the ground, a symbol of his own act....\r\nCohabitation is exercised in public.\"[3] Similar conditions Bachofen\r\nshows have existed among the Lycians, Etruscans, Cretans, Athenians,\r\nLesbians and Egyptians.\r\n\r\nAccording to Morgan, the consanguine family is supervened by a third and\r\nhigher form of family relationship, which he designates as the Punaluan\r\nfamily. _Punalua_, \"dear friend,\" \"intimate companion.\"\r\n\r\nCunow, in his above named book, takes exception to Morgan's views that\r\nthe consanguine family, which rests on the organization of marriage\r\nclasses by generations, preceded the punaluan family as an original\r\norganization. Cunow does not see in the consanguine family the most\r\nprimitive of all social forms, until now discovered. He sees in it\r\nmerely a middle form, that takes its origin in the generation groups; a\r\ntransition stage toward the pure gentile organization, on which, as a\r\ngraft, the division in age classes, belonging to the consanguine family\r\nsystem, still continues for a time in altered form, along with the\r\ndivision in totem-groups.[4] Cunow explains further: The division in\r\nclasses--every individual, man or woman, carries the name of his or her\r\nclass and generation group totem--does not serve to exclude sexual\r\nintercourse between collateral, but to prevent cohabitation between\r\nrelatives in the ascending and descending line, between parents and\r\nchildren, aunts and nephews, uncles and nieces. Terms such as \"aunt,\"\r\n\"uncle,\" etc., he designates as grade-names.\r\n\r\nCunow furnishes the proofs for the correctness of the views in which he\r\ndiffers from Morgan on some points. But, however he may differ from\r\nMorgan in single instances, he emphatically defends him against the\r\nattacks of Westermann and others. He says:\r\n\r\n\"Although here and there a hypothesis of Morgan may have proved itself\r\nfalse, and some others may be allowed only a qualified approval, that\r\nmerit none can gainsay him that he has been the first to establish the\r\nidentity of the North American totem-group with the gentile organization\r\nof the Romans; and, secondly, to demonstrate that our modern systems of\r\nconsanguinity and family-forms are the result of a long process of\r\ndevelopment. In a measure he has thereby first made recent\r\ninvestigations possible; he has first built the foundation on which we\r\nmay build further.\" In the introduction also to his book he says\r\nexpressly that his own work is partly a supplement to Morgan's book on\r\nprimitive man.\r\n\r\nThe Westermanns, the Starckes, the Zieglers--the latter of whom, in his\r\nbook, criticized in the introduction to the twenty-fifth edition of this\r\nwork, refers mainly to the first named, in order to attack our\r\nstatements with theirs--will have to submit, with good grace or bad, to\r\nthe fact that the rise and development of the family has not taken the\r\ncourse that fits in with their bourgeois prejudices. The refutation\r\nthat, in the last part of his work, Cunow bestows upon Westermann and\r\nStarcke, Ziegler's authorities, are calculated to enlighten their most\r\nfanatic followers upon the value of their caviling criticisms of, and\r\narguments against, Morgan.\r\n\r\nAccording to Morgan, the punaluan family has its start with the\r\nexclusion of consanguineous brothers and sisters, on the mother's side.\r\nWhere a woman has several husbands, the evidence of paternity is\r\nimpossible. Paternity becomes a fiction. Even to-day, under the rule of\r\nstrict monogamous marriage, paternity, as Goethe, in his\r\n\"Apprenticeship,\" lets Frederick say, \"rests only upon faith.\" If with\r\nmonogamy, paternity is often doubtful, it is impossible of proof in\r\npolygamy: only descent from the mother is certain and unquestionable.\r\nAccordingly, descent from the mother afforded the only criterion. As all\r\ndeep-reaching transformations in the social relations of primitive man\r\nare accomplished only slowly, the change of the so-called consanguine\r\ninto the punaluan family must unquestionably have engaged vast periods\r\nof time, and been broken through by many relapses, still noticeable in\r\nmuch later days. The proximate external inducement for the development\r\nof the punaluan family was, possibly, the necessity of splitting up the\r\nstrongly swollen membership of the family, to the end that new grounds\r\ncould be occupied for cattle ranges and agriculture. Probably, also,\r\nwith the reaching of a higher grade of civilization, a sense gradually\r\nasserted itself of the harmfulness and indecorousness of sexual\r\nintercourse between brothers and sisters, and close relatives. In favor\r\nof this theory stands a pretty tradition, that, as related by Cunow,\r\nGaston found among the Dieyeries, one of the South Australian tribes, on\r\nthe rise of the \"Mordu\" consanguine group. He says:\r\n\r\n\"After creation, fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers and other near\r\nrelatives married promiscuously among one another, until the evil\r\neffects of such connections showed themselves clearly. A conference of\r\nleaders was held, and it was considered in what way this could be\r\navoided. The outcome of the conference was a request to the Muramura\r\n(Great Spirit); and he ordered in his answer that the tribe be divided\r\ninto several branches, and that, in order to distinguish them, they be\r\ncalled by different names, after animate or inanimate objects. For\r\ninstance: after the dingo, the mouse, the emu, the rain, the\r\niguana-lizard, etc. The members of one and the same group could not\r\nmarry another. The son of a Dingo could not, for instance, marry the\r\ndaughter of a Dingo; each of the two could, however, enter into\r\nconnections with the Mouse, the Emu, the Rat, or any other family.\"\r\n\r\nThis tradition is more sensible and natural, by a good deal, than the\r\nChristian tradition, taught by the Bible. It shows plainly the rise of\r\nthe consanguine groups. Moreover, Paul Lafargue, makes in the \"Neue\r\nZeit\" the sagacious, and, we think, felicitous point, that names, such\r\nas Adam and Eve, are not names of individual persons, but the names of\r\ngentes, in which, at the time, the Jews were joined. Lafargue solves by\r\nhis argument a series of otherwise obscure and contradictory passages in\r\nthe first Book of Moses. Again, M. Beer calls attention, likewise in the\r\n\"Neue Zeit,\" that, to this day, it is a conjugal custom among Jews that\r\nthe bride and the bridegroom's mother _may not carry the same name_,\r\notherwise--thus runs this belief--a misfortune will befall the family:\r\nsickness and death will pursue them. In our opinion, this is a further\r\nproof for the correctness of Lafargue's theory. The gentile organization\r\nforbids marriage between persons that descend from the same gens stock.\r\nSuch a common descent must be considered to exist, according to gentile\r\nprinciples, between the bride, that carries the name of \"Eve,\" and the\r\nbridegroom's mother of the same name. Modern Jews, of course, have no\r\nlonger the remotest suspicion of the real connection between their\r\nprejudice and their old gentile constitution, which forbade such\r\nmarriages of relatives. The old gentile order had for its object to\r\navoid the degenerating consequences of in-breeding. Although this\r\ngentile constitution has for thousands of years been destroyed among the\r\nJews, tradition, as we see, has continued to live in superstition.\r\n\r\nQuite possible, the experience, made at an early day with the breeding\r\nof animals, revealed the harmfulness of in-breeding. How far this\r\nexperience went transpires from the manner in which, according to the\r\nfirst Book of Moses, chap. 30, verse 32 and sequel, Jacob understood how\r\nto outwit his father-in-law Laban, by knowing how to encompass the birth\r\nof eanlings that were streaked and pied, and which, according to Laban's\r\npromises, were to be Jacob's. The old Israelites had, accordingly, long\r\nbefore Darwin, studied Darwinism.\r\n\r\nOnce upon the subject of the conditions existing among the old Jews, a\r\nfew other facts are in order, clearly proving that, among them, descent\r\nin the female line was actually in force of old. True enough, on the\r\nsubject of woman, I Moses, 3, 16, runs this wise: \"And thy desire shall\r\nbe to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee;\" and the verse also\r\nundergoes the variation: \"the woman shall leave father and mother, and\r\ncleave to her husband.\" In point of fact, however, I Moses, 2, 24, has\r\nit this way: \"_Therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and\r\nshall cleave unto his wife_, and they shall be one flesh.\" The same\r\nlanguage recurs in Matthew 19, 15; Mark 10, 7, and in the Epistle to the\r\nEphesians 5, 31. The command sprang, accordingly, from the system of\r\ndescent in the female line, and the exegetists, at a loss what to do\r\nwith it, allowed it to appear in a light that is utterly false.\r\n\r\nDescent in female line appears clearly also in IV Moses, 32, 41. It is\r\nthere said that Jair had a father, who was of the tribe of Judah, but\r\nhis mother was of the tribe of Manasseh, and Jair is expressly called\r\nthe son of Manasseh, and he inherited in that tribe. Another instance of\r\ndescent in the female line among the Jews is met in Nehemiah 7, 63.\r\nThere the children of a priest, who took to wife one of the daughters of\r\nBarzillai--a Jewish clan--are called children of Barzillai; they are,\r\naccordingly, not called after the father, who, moreover, as a priest\r\noccupied a privileged position, but after the mother. For the rest,\r\nalready in the days of the Old Testament, accordingly, in historic\r\ntimes, the father-right prevailed among the Jews, and the clan and tribe\r\norganization rested on descent in the male line. Accordingly, the\r\ndaughters were shut off as heirs, as may be seen in I Moses 31, 14-15,\r\nwhere even Leah and Rachel, the daughters of Laban, complain: \"Is there\r\nyet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house? Are we not\r\ncounted of him strangers? for he has sold us, and hath quite devoured\r\nalso our money.\"\r\n\r\nAs happened with all peoples where descent in male replaced descent in\r\nfemale line, woman among the Jews stood wholly bereft of rights. Wedlock\r\nwas marriage by purchase. On woman the obligation was laid of the\r\nstrictest chastity; on the other hand, man was not bound by the same\r\nordinance; he, moreover, was privileged to possess several wives. Did\r\nthe husband, after the bridal night, believe to have found that his wife\r\nhad, before marriage, lost her maidenhood, not only had he the right to\r\ncast her off, she was stoned to death. The same punishment fell upon the\r\nadultress; upon the husband, however, only in case he committed adultery\r\nwith a married Jewish woman. According to V Moses 24, 1-4, the husband\r\nhad also the right to cast off his newly-married wife, if she found no\r\nfavor in his eyes, even if only out of dislike. He was then to write her\r\na bill of divorcement, give it in her hand, and let her out of the\r\nhouse. An expression of the low position that woman took later among the\r\nJews is furthermore found in the circumstances that, even to this day,\r\nwoman attends divine service in the synagogue, in a space strictly\r\nseparated from the men, and they are not included in the prayers.[5]\r\n\r\nThe relations of the sexes in the punaluan family consisted, according\r\nto Morgan, in one or more sisters, belonging to one family group,\r\nmarrying jointly one or more brothers of another group. The consanguine\r\nsisters, or the first, second and more remote cousins were wives in\r\ncommon with their husbands in common, who could not be their brothers.\r\nThese consanguine brothers, or cousins of several degrees, were the\r\nhusbands in common of their wives in common, who could not be their\r\nsisters. With the stopping of in-breeding, the new family-form\r\nundoubtedly contributed towards the rapid and vigorous development of\r\nthe tribes, and imparted to the tribes, that had turned to this form of\r\nfamily connection, an advantage over those that still retained the old\r\nform of connections.\r\n\r\nIn general, the physical and intellectual differences between man and\r\nwoman were vastly less in primitive days than in our society. Among all\r\nthe peoples, living in the state of savagery or barbarism, the\r\ndifferences in the weight and size of the brain are slighter than among\r\nthe peoples in civilization. Likewise, in strength of body and agility,\r\nthe women among these peoples are but little behind the men. This is\r\nattested not only by the testimony of the ancient writers on the peoples\r\nwho clung to the mother-right. Further testimony is furnished by the\r\narmies of women among the Ashantees and of the King of Dahomey in West\r\nAfrica, who distinguished themselves by special bravery and ferocity.\r\nLikewise does the opinion of Tacitus on the women of the old Germans,\r\nand Caesar's accounts of the women of the Iberians and Scots confirm the\r\nfact. Columbus had to sustain a fight before Santa Cruz with an Indian\r\nskiff in which the women fought as bravely as the men; and we find this\r\ntheory further confirmed in the passages from Havelock Ellis's work,\r\n\"Man and Woman,\" which Dr. Hope B. Adams-Walther deals upon in Nos. 39\r\nand 40 of the \"Neue Zeit.\" He says:\r\n\r\n\"About the Andombis of the Congo, Johnson relates that the women work\r\nhard as carriers and in other occupations. All the same, they lead a\r\nperfectly happy life. They are often stronger and more handsomely built\r\nthan the men; not a few of them have positively magnificent figures.\r\nParke styles the Manynema of the same neighborhood 'fine animals,' and\r\nhe finds the women very stately. They carry burdens as heavy as the men\r\nand with equal ease. A North American Indian chief said to Hearne:\r\n'Women are created for labor; a woman can carry or drag as much as two\r\nmen.' Schellong, who published a painstaking study on the Papuans of New\r\nGuinea in the Ethnologic Journal, issued in 1891, is of the opinion that\r\nthe women are more strongly built than the men. In the interior of\r\nAustralia, women are sometimes beaten by men out of jealousy; but it\r\nhappens not infrequently that it is the man, who, on such occasions,\r\nreceives the stronger dose. In Cuba the women fought shoulder to\r\nshoulder with the men. Among some tribes in India, as well as the\r\nPueblos of North and the Patagonians of South America, the women are as\r\ntall as the men. Even among the Arabians and Druses the difference in\r\nsize is slight; and yet nearer home, among the Russians, the sexes are\r\nmore alike than is the case among the western Europeans. Accordingly, in\r\nall parts of the earth there are instances of equal or approximately\r\nequal physical development.\"\r\n\r\nThe family relations that flow from the Punaluan family were these: The\r\nchildren of my mother's sisters are her children, and the children of my\r\nfather's brothers are his children, and all together are my brothers and\r\nsisters. Conversely, the children of my mother's brothers are her\r\nnephews and nieces, and the children of my father's sisters are his\r\nnephews and nieces, and they, all together, are my cousins. Again, the\r\nhusbands of my mother's sisters are her husbands also, and the wives of\r\nmy father's brothers are also his wives; but my father's sisters and my\r\nmother's brothers are excluded from family relationship, and their\r\nchildren are my cousins.[6]\r\n\r\nAlong with arising civilization, sexual intercourse is proscribed\r\nbetween brothers and sisters, and the proscription gradually extends to\r\nthe remotest collateral relatives on the mother's side. A new group of\r\nconsanguinity arises, the gens, which, in its first form, is made up of\r\na series of consanguine and more remote sisters, together with their\r\nchildren and their consanguine and more remote brothers on their\r\nmother's side. The gens has a common female ancestor, from whom the\r\nfemale successors descend in generations. The husbands of these women\r\nare not of the consanguine group, the gens, of their wives; they are of\r\nthe gens of their sisters. Conversely, the children of these men belong\r\nto the family group of their, the children's mother, descent being in\r\nthe female line. The mother is the head of the family; and thus arises\r\nthe \"mother-right,\" which for a long time constitutes the basis of the\r\nfamily and of inheritance. In keeping therewith--so long as descent was\r\nrecognized in the female line--woman had a seat and voice in the\r\ncouncils of the gens; they voted in the election of the sachems and of\r\nthe military chiefs, and deposed them.\r\n\r\nAbout the Lycians, who abided by the mother-right, Herodotus says;\r\n\"Their customs are partly Cretan, partly Carian. They have, however, a\r\ncustom that distinguishes them from all other nations in the world. Ask\r\na Lycian who he is, and he answers by giving you his own name, the name\r\nof his mother, and so on in the female line. Aye, if a free-born woman\r\nmarries a slave, her children are citizens, but if a free man marries a\r\nstranger, or takes a concubine, even if he be the highest person in the\r\nState, his children forfeit all citizen rights.\"\r\n\r\nIn those days, \"matrimonium\" and not \"patrimonium,\" \"mater familias\"\r\nand not \"pater familias\" were the terms used; and the native land is\r\ncalled the \"dear motherland.\" As with the previous family-forms, so did\r\nthe gens rest upon the community of property, and had a communistic\r\nsystem of household. The woman is the real guide and leader of this\r\nfamily community; hence she enjoys a high degree of respect, in the\r\nhouse as well as in the affairs of the family community concerning the\r\ntribe. She is judge and adjuster of disputes, and frequently performs\r\nthe ceremonies of religion as priestess. The frequent appearance of\r\nQueens and Princesses in antiquity, their controlling influence, even\r\nthere where their sons reigned, for instance, in the history of old\r\nEgypt, are results of the mother-right. Mythology, at that epoch,\r\nassumes predominantly female characters: Astarte, Ceres, Demeter,\r\nLatona, Isis, Frigga, Freia, Gerdha, etc. Woman is considered\r\ninviolable; matricide is the blackest of all crimes: it summons all men\r\nto retribution. The blood-feud is the common concern of all the men of\r\nthe tribe; each is obliged to avenge the wrong done to a member of the\r\nfamily community by the members of another tribe. In defence of the\r\nwomen the men are spurred to highest valor. Thus did the effects of the\r\nmother-right, gyneocracy, manifest themselves in all the relations of\r\nlife among the peoples of antiquity--among the Babylonians, the\r\nAssyrians, the Egyptians, the Greeks, before the time of the Heroes;\r\namong the peoples of Italy, before the founding of Rome; among the\r\nScythians, the Gauls, the Iberians and Cantabrians, the Germans of\r\nTacitus, etc. Woman, at that time, takes in the family and in public\r\nlife a position such as she has never since taken. Along these lines,\r\nsays Tacitus in his \"Germania\": \"They (the Germans) even suppose\r\nsomewhat of sanctity and prescience to be inherent in the female sex;\r\nand, therefore, neither despise their counsels, nor disregard their\r\nresponses;\" and Diodorus, who lived at the time of Caesar, feels highly\r\nindignant over the position of women in Egypt, having learned that\r\nthere, not the sons, but the daughters, supported their aging parents.\r\nHe contemptuously shrugs his shoulders at the poltroons of the Nile, who\r\nrelinquish household and public rights to the members of the weaker sex,\r\nand allow them privileges that must sound unheard-of to a Greek or a\r\nRoman.\r\n\r\nUnder the gyneocracy, a state of comparative peace prevailed in general.\r\nThe horizon was narrow and small, life primitive. The different tribes\r\nseparated themselves from one another, as best they could, and respected\r\ntheir mutual boundaries. Was, however, one tribe attacked by another,\r\nthen the men were obliged to rush to its defence, and in this they were\r\nsupported by the women in the most vigorous fashion. According to\r\nHerodotus, the women joined in battle among the Scythians: as he claims,\r\nthe maid could not marry before she had slain an enemy. What _role_\r\nwomen played in battle among the Germans, Iberians, Scots, etc., has\r\nalready been stated. But in the gens also did they, under given\r\ncircumstances, command a strong regiment:--woe to the man who was either\r\ntoo lazy or too unskilled to contribute his share to the common support.\r\nHe was shown the door, and, either he returned to his own gens, where it\r\nwas with difficulty he was again received with friendliness, or he\r\njoined another gens that was more tolerant toward him.[7]\r\n\r\nThat conjugal life still bears this character in the interior of Africa,\r\nLivingstone learned to his great surprise, as he narrates in his\r\n\"Missionary Travels and Researches in Southern Africa,\" London, 1857. On\r\nthe Zambesi he ran across the Valonda--a handsome, vigorous negro tribe,\r\ndevoted to agriculture--where he found confirmed the informations\r\nreceived from the Portuguese, and which at first seemed incredible to\r\nhim, with regard to the privileged position enjoyed by women. They sit\r\nin council; the young man who marries must move from his own, to the\r\nvillage of his wife: he thereby pledges himself to furnish the mother of\r\nhis wife for life with kindling wood: if he divorces, the children\r\nremain the property of the mother. On the other hand, the wife must see\r\nto the sustenance of the husband. Although, occasionally, slight\r\ndisagreements break out between man and wife, Livingstone found that the\r\nmen did not retaliate, but he discovered that the men, who offended\r\ntheir wives, were punished in the most sensitive manner--through their\r\nstomachs. The husband, he says, comes home to eat, but one woman sends\r\nhim off to another, and he gets nothing. Tired and hungry he climbs a\r\ntree in the most populous part of the village, and announces in woeful\r\ntones: \"Hear! Hear! I thought I had married women, but they are witches\r\nto me! I am a bachelor; I have not a single wife! Is that right towards\r\na man like me?\" If a woman gives physical expression to her anger at a\r\nman, she is sentenced to carry him on her back from the court of the\r\nchieftain to her own house. While she is carrying him home, the other\r\nmen scoff at and jeer her; the women, on the contrary, encourage her\r\nwith all their might, calling out to her: \"Treat him as he deserves; do\r\nit again!\"\r\n\r\nSimilar conditions still exist in the German colony of Cameroon in West\r\nAfrica. A German ship's doctor, who studied the country and its people\r\nby personal observation, writes us thus:\r\n\r\n\"With a large number of tribes, inheritance is based on maternity.\r\nPaternity is immaterial. Brothers and sisters are only the children of\r\none mother. A man does not bequeath his property to his children, but to\r\nthe children of his sister, that is to say, to his nephews and nieces,\r\nas his nearest demonstrable blood relatives. A chief of the Way people\r\nexplained to me in horrible English: \"My sister and I are certainly\r\nblood relatives, consequently her son is my heir; when I die, he will\r\nbe the king of my town.\" \"And your father?\" I inquired. \"I don't know\r\nwhat that means, 'my father,'\" answered he. Upon my putting to him the\r\nquestion whether he had no children, rolling on the ground with\r\nlaughter, he answered that, with them, men have no children, only women.\r\n\r\n\"I can assure you,\" our informant goes on to write, \"that even the heir\r\nof King Bell in Cameroon _is the King's nephew, and not one of his\r\nsons_. The so-called children of King Bell, several of whom are now\r\ngoing through training in German cities, are merely children of his\r\nwives, _whose fathers are unknown_; one of them I might, possibly, claim\r\nfor myself.\"\r\n\r\nWhat say the adversaries of the theory of descent in the female line to\r\nthis sketch drawn from the immediate present? Our informant is a man\r\nwith eyes open, who probed things to the very bottom. How many of those\r\nwho live among these semi-savage races, do as much? Hence the wild\r\naccounts about the \"immorality\" of the natives.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there come to our notice the memorials of the Imperial\r\nGovernment, submitted to the Reichstag on the German colonies (Session\r\nof 1894-95). In the memorial on the Southwestern territory of Africa\r\nthere occurs this passage, p. 239: \"Without their advice--the oldest and\r\nwealthiest--he (chief of the tribe in principal village) can not render\r\nthe slightest decision, and not the men only, _but quite often the women\r\nalso_, even the servants, _express their opinion_.\"\r\n\r\nIn the report of the Marshall Islands, p. 254 of the memorial, it runs\r\nthus: \"The ruling power over all the islands of the Marshall group never\r\nrested in the hands of a single chieftain.... _Seeing, however, that no\r\nfemale member of this class (the Irody) is alive, and only the mother\r\nconveys nobility and rank to the child, the Irodies dies out with their\r\nchieftain._\" The expression used, and the descriptions made, by\r\nreporters betray what an utter blank are to them the conditions that\r\nthey refer to: they can not find their bearings among them.\r\n\r\nWith an increasing population, there arise a number of sisters, which,\r\nin turn, produce daughter gentes. Over and against these, the mother\r\ngens appears as phratry. A number of phratries constitute a tribe. This\r\nsocial organization is so firm that it still constituted the foundation\r\nfor the military organization in the old States, after the old gentile\r\nconstitution had fallen to pieces. The tribe splits up into several\r\ntribes, all of which have the same constitution, and in each of which\r\nthe old gentes are reproduced. However, seeing that the gentile\r\nconstitution forbids the intermarriage of brothers and sisters, and of\r\nrelatives on the mother's side to the furthest degree, it undermines its\r\nown foundation. Due to the evermore complicated relations of the\r\nseparate gentes with one another--a condition of things that the social\r\nand economic progress promotes--the inhibition of marriage between the\r\nseveral gentes, that descend from the mother's side, becomes in the\r\nlong run impracticable: it breaks down of itself, or is burst asunder.\r\nSo long as the production of the means of subsistence was still at the\r\nlowest stages, and satisfied only simple wants, the activity of man and\r\nwoman was essentially the same. Along with an increasing division of\r\nlabor, there came about, not merely a division of functions, but also a\r\ndivision of occupations. Fishing, the hunt, cattle-raising,--demanded\r\nseparate knowledge; and, to a still higher degree, the construction of\r\ntools and utensils, which became mainly the property of the men. Field\r\nagriculture expanded materially the circle of activities, and it created\r\na supply of subsistence that satisfied the highest demands of the time.\r\nMan, whose activity stood in the foreground in the course of this\r\ndevelopment, became the real lord and owner of these sources of wealth,\r\nwhich, in turn, furnished the basis for commerce; and this created new\r\nrelations, and social changes.\r\n\r\nNot only did ever fresh causes of friction and conflicts arise for the\r\npossession of the best lands, due to the increase of population, and the\r\nneed of wider domains for cattle-raising and agriculture, but, along\r\nwith such increase of population, there arose the need of labor power to\r\ncultivate the ground. The more numerous these powers, all the greater\r\nwas the wealth in products and herds. These struggles led, first, to the\r\nrape of women, later to the enslaving of conquered men. The women became\r\nlaborers and objects of pleasure for the conqueror; their males became\r\nslaves. Two elements were thereby simultaneously introduced into the old\r\ngentile constitution. The two and the gentile constitution could not, in\r\nthe long run, get along together.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, hand in hand with the increasing differentiation of\r\noccupations, owing to the growing need of tools, utensils, weapons,\r\netc., handicraft rises into existence. It follows its own course of\r\ndevelopment and separates itself from agriculture. As a consequence, a\r\ndistinct population, one that plies the trades, is called into life; and\r\nit splits off from the agricultural population with entirely different\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nAccording to the mother-right, i. e., so long as descent followed only\r\nin female line, the custom was that the gentile relatives inherited from\r\nthe deceased gentile fellow-members on the mother's side. The property\r\nremained in the gens. The children of the deceased father did not belong\r\nto his gens, but to that of the mother: accordingly, they did not\r\ninherit from the father; at his death his property fell back to his own\r\ngens. Under the new conditions, where the father was the\r\nproperty-holder, i. e., the owner of herds and slaves, of weapons and\r\nutensils, and where he had become a handicraftsman, or merchant, his\r\nproperty, so long as he was still considered of the gens of his mother,\r\nfell after his death, not to his own children, but to his brothers and\r\nsisters, and to the children of his sisters, or to the successors of\r\nhis sisters. His own children went away empty-handed. The pressure to\r\nchange such a state of things was, accordingly, powerful;--and it was\r\nchanged. Thereupon a condition arose that was not yet monogamy, but that\r\napproximated it; there arose the \"pairing family.\" A certain man lived\r\nwith a certain woman, and the children, born of that relation, were that\r\ncouple's own children. These pairing families increased in the measure\r\nin which the marriage inhibitions, that flowed from the gentile\r\nconstitution, hampered marriage, and in which the above mentioned\r\neconomic grounds rendered desirable this new form of family life.\r\nPersonal property accorded ill with the old condition of things, which\r\nrested upon the community of goods. Both _rank_ and _occupation_ now\r\ndecidedly favored the necessity for the choice of a domicile. The\r\nproduction of merchandise begot commerce with neighboring and foreign\r\nnations; and that necessitated money. It was man who led and controlled\r\nthis development. His private interests had, accordingly, no longer any\r\nreal points of contact with the old gentile organization, whose\r\ninterests often stood in opposition to his own. Accordingly, the\r\nimportance of the gentile organization sank ever more. The gens finally\r\nbecame little more than the center of the religious functions for the\r\nfamily, its economic significance was gone. The complete dissolution of\r\ngentile organization became only a question of time.\r\n\r\nWith the dissolution of the old gentile organization, the influence and\r\nposition of woman sank rapidly. The mother-right vanished; the\r\nfather-right stepped into its shoes. Man now became a private\r\nproperty-holder: he had an interest in children, whom he could look upon\r\nas legitimate, and whom he made the heirs of his property: hence _he\r\nforced upon woman the command of abstinence from intercourse with other\r\nmen_.\r\n\r\nAt the same time man assumed the right of taking unto himself, beside\r\nhis own wife, or several of them, as many concubines as his condition\r\nallowed; and the children of these concubines were likewise treated as\r\nlegitimate. On this head we find two valuable illustrations in the\r\nBible. In I Book of Moses, chapter 16, verses 1 and 2, we read: \"Now\r\nSarai, Abram's wife, bare him no children: and she had a hand-maid, an\r\nEgyptian, whose name was Hagar. And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now,\r\nthe Lord has restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my\r\nmaid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened\r\nto the voice of Sarai.\" The second remarkable illustration is found in I\r\nBook of Moses 30, 1 and sequel: \"And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob\r\nno children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me\r\nchildren, or else I die. And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel;\r\nand he said, Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit\r\nof the womb? and she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and\r\nshe shall bear upon my knees that I may also have children by her. And\r\nshe gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her.\"\r\n\r\nJacob, accordingly, had not only the daughters of Laban, two sisters,\r\nsimultaneously for wives, they also helped him to their maids, all of\r\nwhich, according to the usage of the times, was wholly free from taint\r\nof impropriety. The two principal wives he had bought, as is well known,\r\nby serving Laban seven years for each. The purchase of a wife was at the\r\ntime common among the Jews, but, along with the purchase of wives, whom\r\nthey were compelled to take from among their own people, they practiced\r\non an extensive scale the rape of women from among the peoples that they\r\nconquered. The Benjaminites raped the daughters of Silos.[8] In such\r\nwars, it was originally customary that all the men who fell into the\r\nhands of the vanquisher were killed. The captured woman became a slave,\r\na concubine. Nevertheless, she could be raised to the dignity of a\r\nlegitimate wife so soon as she had fulfilled certain conditions of the\r\nJews: she had to cut her hair and nails; to lay off the dress she was\r\ncaptured in, and exchange it for another that was given her; thereupon\r\nshe had to mourn a whole month for her father and mother: she was, in a\r\nmanner to be dead to her own people, become estranged from them: then\r\ncould she climb into the conjugal bed. The largest number of wives had\r\nKing Solomon, as is known. According to Kings 1, 11, not less than 700\r\nwives and 300 concubines are ascribed to him.\r\n\r\nWith the rule of the father-right and descent in the male line in the\r\nJewish gentile organization, the daughters were excluded from\r\ninheritance. Later this was, however, changed, at least when a father\r\nleft no sons. This appears from IV Book of Moses 27, 2-8, where it is\r\nreported that, as Zelaphehad died without sons, and his daughter\r\ncomplained bitterly that she was to be excluded from her father's\r\ninheritance, which was to fall back to the tribe of Joseph, Moses\r\ndecided that, in that case, the daughters should inherit. But seeing\r\nthat she contemplated marrying, according to custom, in another tribe,\r\nthe tribe of Joseph complained that thereby the inheritance would be\r\nlost to it. Thereupon Moses decided further (4, 36) that heiresses,\r\nthough free in the choice of a husband, were bound to marry in the tribe\r\nof their own father. For the sake of property, the old ordinance was\r\noverthrown. Similarly, in Athens, did Solon decree that an heiress had\r\nto marry her nearest male agnate, even though both belonged to the same\r\ngens, and, according to former law, such a marriage was forbidden. Solon\r\nordered also that a property-holder was not compelled as thitherto, to\r\nleave his property to his own gens in case he died childless; but that\r\nhe could by testament constitute any one else his heir. From all this it\r\nis obvious:--man does not rule property, property rules him, and becomes\r\nhis master.\r\n\r\nWith the rule of private property, the subjection of woman to man, her\r\nbondage was sealed. Then came the time of disregard, even of contempt\r\nfor woman.\r\n\r\n_The reign of the mother-right implied communism; equality for all; the\r\nrise of the father-right implied the reign of private property, and,\r\nwith it, the oppression and enslavement of woman._\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to trace in detail the manner in which the change was\r\nachieved. A knowledge of the events is lacking. Neither did this _first\r\ngreat revolution_ in the lap of mankind come into force simultaneously\r\namong the ancient nations; nor yet is it probable that it was\r\naccomplished everywhere in the same manner. Among the peoples of old\r\nGreece, it was Athens where the new order of things first prevailed.\r\n\r\nFrederick Engels is of the opinion that this great revolution was\r\naccomplished peacefully, and that, after all the conditions for the new\r\nrights were at hand, it only required a simple vote in the gens in order\r\nto rear the father in the place of the mother-right. Bachofen, on the\r\ncontrary, grounding his opinion upon more or less reliable information\r\nfrom the old writers, holds that the women offered strong resistance to\r\nthis social transformation. He, for instance, sees in the legends of the\r\nAmazonian Kingdoms, which re-appear under manifold variations in the old\r\nhistory of Asia and the Orient, and also have turned up in South America\r\nand in China, proofs for the struggle and resistance which the women\r\noffered to the new order. We leave that as it may be.\r\n\r\nWith the rule of man, women lost their position in the community; they\r\nwere excluded from the councils and from all leading influence. Man\r\nexacts conjugal fidelity from her, but claims exemption for himself. If\r\nshe violates that, she is guilty of the most serious deception that can\r\nafflict the new citizen; she thereby introduces into his house\r\nstranger's children as heirs of his property. Hence, among all ancient\r\nnations, the breach of conjugal fidelity on the part of woman is\r\npunished with death or slavery.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding women were thus removed from their position as leaders,\r\nthe customs connected with the old system of morals continued for\r\ncenturies to sway the public mind, although the meaning of the surviving\r\ncustoms was gradually lost to the people. It is only in modern times\r\nthat pains are being taken to inquire into the original meaning of these\r\nold customs. In Greece, for instance, it remained a religious practice\r\nthat Greek women prayed only to goddesses for advice, help and favors.\r\nLikewise, the yearly recurring celebration of the Thesmophoria owed its\r\norigin to the days of mother-right. Even in later days, the women of\r\nGreece celebrated this festival for five days in honor of Demeter; and\r\nno man was allowed to be present. It was similarly in old Rome with a\r\nfestival in honor of Ceres. Both Demeter and Ceres were considered\r\ngoddesses of fertility. In Germany also such festivals, once customary\r\nin the heathen days of Frigga, were held, deep into the Middle Ages,\r\nFrigga being considered the goddess of fertility among the old Germans.\r\nAccording to the narratives, women gave a free reign to their\r\nfrolicsomeness on the occasions of these festivals. Also here men were\r\nexcluded from participation in the festival.\r\n\r\nIn Athens, where, as already stated, the mother-right made earliest room\r\nfor the father-right, but, as it seems, under strong opposition from the\r\nwomen, the transition is portrayed touchingly and in all the fullness of\r\nits tragic import, in the \"Eumenides\" of Aeschylus. The story is this:\r\nAgamemnon, King of Mycene, and husband of Clytemnestra, sacrifices his\r\ndaughter, Iphigenia, upon the command of the oracle on his expedition\r\nagainst Troy. The mother, indignant at the sacrifice of her daughter,\r\ntakes, during her husband's absence, Aegysthos for her consort. Upon\r\nAgamemnon's return to Mycene, after an absence of many years, he is\r\nmurdered by Aegysthos with the connivance of Clytemnestra. Orestes, the\r\nson of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, avenges the murder of his father, at\r\nthe instigation of Apollo and Athene, by slaying his mother and\r\nAegysthos. The Erinnyes, as representatives of the old law, pursue\r\nOrestes on account of the murder of his mother. Apollo and Athene, the\r\nlatter of whom, according to mythology, is motherless--she leaped\r\nfull-armed out of the head of Jupiter--represent the new law, and defend\r\nOrestes. The issue is carried to the Areopagus, before which the\r\nfollowing dialogue ensues. The two hostile principles come here into\r\ndramatic vividness of expression:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Erinnyes--The prophet bade thee be a matricide?\r\n\r\n    Orestes--And to this hour I am well content withal.\r\n\r\n    Erinnyes--Thoul't change that tune, when judgment seizes thee.\r\n\r\n    Orestes--My father from his tomb will take my part; I fear not.\r\n\r\n    Erinnyes--Ay, rely on dead men's aid,\r\n    When guilty of matricide!\r\n\r\n    Orestes--She, that is slain,\r\n    Was doubly tainted.\r\n\r\n    Erinnyes--How? Inform the court.\r\n\r\n    Orestes--She slew her wedded lord, and slew my sire.\r\n\r\n    Erinnyes--Death gave her quittance, then. But thou yet livest.\r\n\r\n    Orestes--And while she lived, why did you not pursue her?\r\n\r\n    Erinnyes--No tie of blood bound her to whom she slew.\r\n\r\n    Orestes--But I was tied by blood-affinity\r\n    To her who bare me?\r\n\r\n    Erinnyes--Else, thou accursed one,\r\n    How nourished she thy life within her womb?\r\n    Wouldst thou renounce the holiest bond of all?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Erinnyes, it will be noticed, recognize no rights on the part of\r\nthe father and the husband; to them there exists only the right of the\r\nmother. That Clytemnestra slew her husband is indifferent to them; on\r\nthe other hand, they demand punishment for the matricide, committed by\r\nOrestes: in killing his mother he had committed the worst crime\r\nimaginable under the old gentile order. Apollo, on the contrary, stands\r\non the opposite principle. Commissioned by Zeus to avenge the murder of\r\nhis father, he had led Orestes to the murder of his own mother. Apollo\r\nnow defends Orestes' action before the judges, saying:\r\n\r\n\r\n    That scruple likewise I can satisfy.\r\n    She who is called the mother of the child\r\n    Is not its parent, but the nurse of seed\r\n    Implanted in begetting. He that sows\r\n    Is author of the shoot, which she, if Heaven\r\n    Prevent not, keeps as in a garden-ground.\r\n    In proof whereof, to show that fatherhood\r\n    May be without the mother, I appeal\r\n    To Pallas, daughter of Olympian Zeus,\r\n    In present witness here. Behold a plant,\r\n    Not moulded in the darkness of the womb,\r\n    Yet nobler than all scions of Heaven's stock.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Apollo, the act of begetting confers the superior right;\r\nwhereas, according to the views in force until then, the mother, who\r\ngives to the child her blood and its life, was esteemed the sole\r\npossessor of the child, while the man, the father of her child, was\r\nregarded a stranger. Hence the Erinnyes reply to the strange notions of\r\nApollo:\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Thou didst lead astray\r\n    Those primal goddesses with draughts of wine,\r\n    O'erturning ordinance.\r\n    Young, thou wouldst override our ancient right.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe judges, thereupon, make ready for the sentence. One half stand by\r\nthe old, one half by the new right; a tie is threatened; thereupon\r\nAthene seizes the ballot from the altar and dropping it in the urn,\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\r\n    To me it falls to give my judgment last.\r\n    Here openly I give it for Orestes.\r\n    No mother bore me. To the masculine side\r\n    For all save marriage my whole heart is given,--\r\n    In all and everything the father's child.\r\n    So little care I for a woman's death,\r\n    That slew her lord, the guardian of her home.\r\n    Now though the votes be even, Orestes wins.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new right won. Marriage with the father as head, had overpowered the\r\ngyneocracy.\r\n\r\nAnother legend represents the downfall of the mother-right in Athens\r\nthis way: \"Under the reign of Kekrops, a double miracle happened. There\r\nbroke forth simultaneously out of the earth an oil-tree, and at another\r\nplace water. The frightened king sent to Delphi to interrogate the\r\nOracle upon the meaning of these happenings. The answer was: 'The\r\noil-tree stands for Minerva, the water for Neptune; it is now with the\r\ncitizens after which of the two deities they wish to name their city.'\r\nKekrops called together the assembly of the people in which men and\r\nwomen enjoyed the right of suffrage. The men voted for Neptune, the\r\nwomen for Minerva; and as the women had a majority of one, Minerva won.\r\nThereupon Neptune was angered and he caused the sea to wash over the\r\nterritory of the Athenians. In order to soothe the wrath of the god, the\r\nAthenians placed a threefold punishment upon their women:--_they were to\r\nforfeit the suffrage, children were no longer to carry their mother's\r\nname, and they themselves were no longer to be called Athenian\r\nwomen_.\"[9]\r\n\r\nAs in Athens, the transition from the mother to the father-right was\r\neverywhere achieved so soon as a certain height was reached in social\r\ndevelopment. Woman is crowded into the house; she is isolated; she is\r\nassigned special quarters--the gynekonitis--, in which she lives; she is\r\neven excluded from intercourse with the male visitors of the house.\r\nThat, in fact, was the principal object of her isolation.\r\n\r\nThis change finds its expression as early as the Odyssey. Telemachus\r\nforbids Penelope's, his mother's, presence among the suitors. He, the\r\nson, orders his mother:\r\n\r\n\r\n    But come now, go to thy bower, and deal with such things as ye can;\r\n    With the sock and the loom be busy, and thine handmaids order and\r\n             teach,\r\n    That they speed the work and the wearing; but for men is the word\r\n             and the speech;\r\n    For all, but for me the chiefest, for here am I the might and the\r\n             power.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was the doctrine already common in Greece at that time. It went\r\neven further. Woman, even if a widow, stands so completely under the\r\nrule of the nearest male relative, that she no longer has even the\r\nchoice of a husband. The suitors, tired of long waiting, due to the\r\ncunning of Penelope, address themselves to Telemachus through the mouth\r\nof Antinous, saying:\r\n\r\n\r\n    But for thee, do we the suitors this answer to thee show,\r\n    That thou in thy soul may'st know it, and that all the folk may know,\r\n    _Send thou thy mother away, and bid her a wedding to gain_\r\n    _With whomso her father willeth, of whomso her heart may be fain_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is at an end with the freedom of woman. If she leaves the house, she\r\nmust veil herself not to awaken the desires of another man. In the\r\nOrient, where, due to the warm climate, sexual passion is strongest,\r\nthis method of seclusion is carried even to-day to extreme lengths.\r\nAthens becomes in this a pattern for the ancient nations. Woman shares,\r\nindeed, her husband's bed, but not his table; she does not address him\r\nby name, but \"Sir;\" she is his maid-servant; she was allowed to appear\r\nnowhere openly; on the street she was ever veiled and clad with greatest\r\nsimplicity. If she committed adultery, she paid for the trespass,\r\naccording to the laws of Solon, with her life, or with her freedom. The\r\nhusband could sell her for a slave.\r\n\r\nThe position of the Greek woman at the time when Greece was rushing to\r\nthe zenith of her development comes into plastic expression in the\r\n\"Medea\" of Euripedes. She complains:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ay, of all living and of all reasoning things\r\n    Are women the most miserable race:\r\n    Who first needs buy a husband at great price,\r\n    To take him then for owner of our lives:\r\n    For this ill is more keen than common ills.\r\n    And of essays most perilous is this,\r\n    Whether one good or evil do we take.\r\n    For evil-famed to women is divorce,\r\n    Nor can one spurn a husband. She, so brought\r\n    Beneath new rule and wont, had surely need\r\n    To be a prophetess, unless at home\r\n    She learned the likeliest prospect with her spouse.\r\n    And if, we having aptly searched out this,\r\n    A husband house with us not savagely\r\n    Drawing in the yoke, ours is an envied life;\r\n    But if not, most to be desired is death.\r\n    And if a man grow sick to herd indoors,\r\n    He, going forth, stays his heart's weariness,\r\n    Turning him to some friend or natural peer;\r\n    But we perforce to one sole being look.\r\n    But, say they, we, while they fight with the spear,\r\n    Lead in our homes a life undangerous:\r\n    Judging amiss; for I would liefer thrice\r\n    Bear brunt of arms than once bring forth a child.\r\n\r\n\r\nWholly otherwise stood matters for the men. Although with an eye to the\r\nbegetting of legitimate heirs for his property, he imposed upon woman\r\nstrict abstinence from other men, he was, nevertheless, not inclined to\r\nlay a corresponding abstinence upon himself.\r\n\r\nHetairism sprang up. Women distinguished for their beauty and intellect,\r\nand who, as a rule, were aliens, preferred a free life in intimate\r\nintercourse with men, to the slavery of marriage. Nothing objectionable\r\nwas seen in that. The names and fame of these hetairae, who held\r\nintimate intercourse with the leading men of Greece, and participated in\r\ntheir learned discourses, as well as in their revels, has come down to\r\nour own days; whereas the names of the legitimate wives are mostly\r\nforgotten and lost. Thus the handsome Aspasia was the intimate friend of\r\nthe celebrated Pericles, who later made her his legitimate wife; the\r\nname of Phryne became in later days the generic designation of those\r\nwomen that were to be had for money. Phryne held intimate relations with\r\nHyperides, and she stood for Praxiteles, one of the first sculptors of\r\nGreece, as the model for his Aphrodite. Danae was the sweetheart of\r\nEpicurus, Archeanassa that of Plato. Other celebrated hetairae, whose\r\nnames have reached our days, were Lais of Corinth, Gnathanea, etc. There\r\nis no celebrated Greek, who had no intercourse with hetairae. It\r\nbelonged to the style of life of distinguished Greeks. Demosthenes, the\r\ngreat orator, described in his oration against Neara, the sexual life of\r\nthe rich men of Athens in these words: \"_We marry a woman in order to\r\nobtain legitimate children, and to have a faithful warder in the house;\r\nwe keep concubines for our service and daily care; and hetairae for the\r\nenjoyment of love._\" The wife was, accordingly, only an apparatus for\r\nthe production of children; a faithful dog, that watched the house. The\r\nmaster of the house, on the contrary, lived according to his _bon\r\nplaisir_, as he willed.\r\n\r\nIn order to satisfy the demand for venal women, particularly with\r\nyounger males, there arose that which was unknown under the rule of the\r\nmother-right,--_prostitution_. Prostitution distinguishes itself from\r\nthe free sexual intercourse that customs and social institutions\r\nrendered a matter of course under primitive conditions, and,\r\naccordingly, freed from objectionableness, in that the woman sells her\r\nbody, either to one man or to several, for material benefit.\r\nProstitution, therefore, exists so soon as woman makes a trade of her\r\ncharms. Solon, who formulated the new law for Athens, and is,\r\nconsequently, esteemed the founder of the new legal status, was also the\r\nfounder of the public houses for women, the \"deikterion,\"--official\r\nhouses of prostitution--, and the price to all the customers was the\r\nsame. According to Philemon it amounted to one obolus, about four cents\r\nof our money. Like the temples with the Greeks and Romans, and the\r\nChristian churches in Middle Ages, the deikterion was inviolable: it\r\nstood under the protection of the Government. Until about a hundred and\r\nfifty years before our reckoning, the Temple of Jerusalem also was the\r\nusual place of gathering for the _filles de joie_.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit that Solon bestowed upon the Athenian male population,\r\nin founding the deikterion, he was praised in song by one of his\r\ncontemporaries in these words: \"Hail to you, Solon! You bought public\r\nwomen for the benefit of the city, for the benefit of the morality of a\r\ncity that is full of vigorous young men, who, in the absence of your\r\nwise institution, would give themselves over to the disturbing annoyance\r\nof the better women.\" We shall see that, at the close of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, justification is sought for the regulation of houses of\r\nprostitution by Government, and for the necessity of prostitution\r\nitself, upon the identical grounds. Thus, actions, committed by men,\r\nwere recognized by legislation as a natural right, while, committed by\r\nwomen, were held to be shameful, and a serious crime. As is well known,\r\neven to-day not few are the men who prefer the company of a pretty\r\nfemale sinner to that of their own wives, and who not infrequently\r\nbelong to the \"Props of the State,\" the \"Pillars of Order,\" and are\r\n\"guardians of the sanctity of marriage and the family.\"\r\n\r\nTrue enough, it seems, that the Greek women often revenged themselves\r\nupon their marital-lords for the yoke placed upon them. If prostitution\r\nis the supplement of monogamy, on the one side, adultery among women and\r\nthe cuckoldry of men is its supplement, on the other. Among the Greek\r\ndramatic poets, Euripides is the woman-hater: he loved to make women the\r\nobject of attacks in his dramas. What all he twitted them with appears\r\nbest from the speech that a Greek woman flings at him in the\r\n\"Thesmophoria\" of Aristophanes. She says among other things:\r\n\r\n\r\n    With what slanderous dirt does not he (Euripides) besmirch us?\r\n    When does the slanderer's tongue hold its peace? In short:\r\n    Wherever there is an audience, tragedies or choruses,\r\n    There we are called corner-loafers, anglers for men,\r\n    Fond of the wine-cup, treasonable arch-gossips,\r\n    Not a good hair is left us; we are the plague of men.\r\n    Therefore, soon as our husbands return to us home from the\r\n        benches,[10]\r\n    Eyes of suspicion upon us they cast, and look about\r\n    Whether a place of concealment conceal not a rival.\r\n    Whereupon, none of the things, at first by us done,\r\n    Now is allowed us: Such stuff against us\r\n    Does he in the men's heads stick, that, if a woman\r\n    Is weaving a garland, she is held to be in love; or when,\r\n    While hustling the household to keep, something drops,\r\n    Forthwith the husband inquires: \"Whom are those fragments meant for?\r\n    Plainly, they are meant for the guest from Corinthos.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can understand that this ready-tongued Greek woman should serve the\r\nassailer of her sex in such manner; nevertheless, Euripides could not\r\nvery well have made these accusations, nor could he have found credence\r\nwith the men, if they knew not but too well that the accusations were\r\njustified. To judge by the concluding sentences of this address, the\r\ncustom--met later in Germany and many other countries--had not yet been\r\nnaturalized in Greece, that the host placed his own wife or daughter at\r\nthe disposal of his guest for the night. Murner writes on this custom,\r\nprevalent in Holland as late as the fifteenth century, in these words:\r\n\"It is the custom in the Netherlands, when the host has a dear guest,\r\nthat he lets his wife sleep with him on faith.\"[11]\r\n\r\nThe increasing struggles between the classes in the several states of\r\nGreece, and the sad state of many of the smaller communities, gave\r\noccasion for Plato to inquire into the best constitution and the best\r\ninstitutions for the State. In his \"Republic,\" set up by him as ideal,\r\nhe demands, at least for the first class of his citizens, the watchers,\r\nthe complete equality of woman. Women are to participate in the\r\nexercises of arms, the same as the men, and are to fill the same duties\r\nas these, only they are to attend to the lighter ones, \"owing to the\r\nweakness of the sex.\" He maintains that the natural inclinations are\r\nequally distributed among the two sexes, only that woman is in all\r\nmatters weaker than man. Furthermore, the women are to be common to the\r\nmen, and vice versa; likewise are the children to be common, \"so that\r\nneither the father may know his child, nor the child his father.\"[12]\r\n\r\nAristotle, in his \"Politics,\" is satisfied with less. Woman should have\r\na free hand in the selection of her husband, but she is to be\r\nsubordinate to him; nevertheless, she should have the right \"to give\r\ngood advice.\" Thucydides expresses an opinion that meets with the\r\napplause of all modern Philistines. He says: \"That wife deserves the\r\nhighest praise of whom, outside of her home, neither good nor bad is\r\nheard.\"\r\n\r\nWith such views, respect for woman was bound to sink to a low level;\r\nfear of over-population even led to the avoidance of intimate\r\nintercourse with her. Unnatural means of satisfying sexual desires were\r\nresorted to. The Greek states were cities with small territories, unable\r\nto supply the usual sustenance to a population in excess of a given\r\nnumber. Hence the fear of over-population caused Aristotle to recommend\r\nto the men abstinence from their wives, and pederasty, instead. Before\r\nhim, Socrates had praised pederasty as the sign of a higher culture. In\r\nthe end, the most promising men of Greece became adherents of this\r\nunnatural passion. Regard for women sank all the deeper. There were now\r\nhouses for male prostitutes, as there were for female. In such a social\r\natmosphere, it was natural for Thucydides to utter the saying that woman\r\nwas worse than the storm-lashed ocean's wave, than the fire's glow, than\r\nthe cascade of the wild mountain torrent. \"If it is a God that invented\r\nwoman, wherever, he may be, let him know, that he is the unhallowed\r\ncause of the greatest evil.\"[13]\r\n\r\nThe male population of Greece having become addicted to pederasty, the\r\nfemale population fell into the opposite extreme: it took to the love of\r\nmembers of its own sex. This happened especially with the women of the\r\nisland of Lesbos, whence this aberration was, and still continues to be\r\nnamed, \"Lesbian love,\" for it has not yet died out: it survives among\r\nus. The poetess Sappho, \"the Lesbian nightingale,\" who lived about six\r\nhundred years before our reckoning, is considered the leading\r\nrepresentative of this form of love. Her passion is glowingly expressed\r\nin her hymn to Aphrodite, whom she implores:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Glittering-throned, undying Aphrodite,\r\n    Wile-weaving daughter of high Zeus, I pray thee,\r\n    Tame not my soul with heavy woe, dread mistress,\r\n    Nay, nor with anguish.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA still more passionate sensuousness is attested in her hymn to the\r\nhandsome Atthis.\r\n\r\nWhile in Athens, along with the rest of Greece, the father-right ruled,\r\nSparta, the rival for supremacy with Athens, still continued under the\r\nmother-right, a condition that had become wholly foreign to most Greeks.\r\nThe story runs that one day a Greek asked a Spartan what punishment was\r\nmeted out in Sparta to the adulterer. He answered: \"Stranger, among us\r\nthere are no adulterers.\" \"But if there should be any?\" \"For\r\npunishment,\" the Spartan replied, sarcastically, \"he must donate an ox,\r\nso large as to be able to reach over Taygetus with his head, and drink\r\nout of Eurotas.\" Upon the startled question, put by the stranger, \"How\r\ncan an ox be so large?\" the Spartan answered laughing: \"How is it\r\npossible that there could be an adulterer in Sparta?\" At the same time\r\nthe self-consciousness of the Spartan woman appears in the proud answer\r\ngiven a stranger by the wife of Leonidas. On his saying to her: \"You\r\nfemale Lacedaemonians are the only women who rule over your men,\" she\r\nanswered: \"So are we the only women who bring men into the world.\"\r\n\r\nThe free condition of women under the mother-right promoted her beauty,\r\nraised her pride, her dignity and her self-reliance. The judgment of all\r\nancient writers is to the effect that, during the period of the\r\ngyneocracy, these qualities were highly developed among women. The\r\nconstrained condition that later supervened, necessarily had its evil\r\neffect upon them. The difference appears even in the garb of the two\r\nperiods. The garb of the Doric woman hung loose from her shoulders; it\r\nleft the arms free, and thighs exposed: it is the garb of Diana, who is\r\nrepresented as free and bold in our museums. The Ionian garb, on the\r\ncontrary, concealed the body and hampered its motion. The garb of woman\r\nto-day is, far more than usually realized, a sign of her dependence and\r\nhelplessness. The style of woman's dress amongst most peoples, down to\r\nour own days, renders her awkward, forces on her a sense of weakness,\r\nand makes her timid; and this, finally, finds its expression in her\r\nattitude and character. The custom among the Spartans of letting the\r\ngirls go naked until marriageable age--a custom that the climate\r\nallowed--contributed considerably, in the opinion of an ancient writer,\r\nto impart to them a taste for simplicity and for attention to decency.\r\nNor was there in the custom, according to the views of those days, aught\r\noffensive to decorum, or inciting to lust. Furthermore, the girls\r\nparticipated in all the bodily exercises, just as the boys, and thus\r\nthere was reared a vigorous, proud, self-conscious race, a race that was\r\nconscious of its own merit, as proved by the answer of Leonidas' wife to\r\nthe stranger.\r\n\r\nIn intimate connection with the mother-right, after it had ceased to be\r\na ruling social principle, stood certain customs, which modern writers,\r\nignorant of their meaning, designate as \"prostitution.\" In Babylon, it\r\nwas a religious duty with the maid, who had reached puberty, to appear\r\nonce in the temple of Mylitta in order to offer her maidenhood as a\r\nsacrifice, by surrendering herself to some man. Similarly happened in\r\nthe Serapeum of Memphis; in Armenia, in honor of the goddess Anaitis; in\r\nCyprus; in Tyrus and Sidon, in honor of Astarte or Aphrodite. The\r\nfestivals of Isis among the Egyptians served similar customs. This\r\nsacrifice of virginity was demanded in order to atone with the goddess\r\nfor the exclusive surrender of woman to one man in marriage:--\"Not that\r\nshe may wilt in the arms of a single man is woman arrayed by nature with\r\nall the charms at its command.\"[14] The continued favor of the goddess\r\nhad to be purchased by the sacrifice of virginity to a stranger. It was\r\nlikewise in line with the old idea that the Lybian maids earned their\r\ndower by prostituting their bodies. In accord with the mother-right,\r\nthese women were sexually free during their unmarried status; and the\r\nmen saw so little objection in these pickings, that those were taken by\r\nthem for wives who had been most in demand. It was thus also among the\r\nThracians, in the days of Herodotus: \"They do not watch the maidens, but\r\nleave them full freedom to associate with whom they please. The women,\r\nhowever, they watch strictly. They buy them from their parents for large\r\nsums.\" Celebrated were the Hierodulae of the temple of Aphrodite at\r\nCorinth, where always more than one thousand maidens were gathered, and\r\nconstituted a chief point of attraction for the men of Greece. Of the\r\ndaughter of King Cheops of Egypt, the legend relates that she had a\r\npyramid built out of the proceeds of prostitution of her charms.\r\n\r\nConditions, similar to these, prevail down to now, on the Mariana, the\r\nPhilippine and the Polynesian islands; according to Waitz, also among\r\nseveral African tribes. Another custom, prevalent till late on the\r\nBalearic islands, and indicative of the right of all men to a woman, was\r\nthat, on the wedding night, the male kin had access to the bride in\r\norder of seniority. The bridegroom came last; he then took her as wife\r\ninto his own possession. This custom has been changed among other people\r\nso that the priest or the tribal chiefs (kings) exercise the privilege\r\nover the bride, as representatives of the men of the tribe. On Malabar,\r\nthe Caimars hire patamars (priests) to deflower their wives.... The\r\nchief priest (Namburi) is in duty bound to render this service to the\r\nking (Zamorin) at his wedding, and the king rewards him with fifty gold\r\npieces.[15] In Further India, and on several islands of the great ocean,\r\nit is sometimes the priests and sometimes the tribal chiefs who\r\nundertake the function.[16] The same happens in Senegambia, where the\r\ntribal chief exercises, as a duty of his office, the deflowering of\r\nmaids, and receives therefor a present. Again, with other peoples, the\r\ncustom was, and continues here and yonder, that the deflowering of a\r\nmaid, sometimes even of a child only a few months old, is done by means\r\nof images of deities, fashioned expressly for this purpose. It may also\r\nbe accepted as certain that the \"jus primae noctis\" (the right of the\r\nfirst night), prevalent in Germany and all Europe until late in the\r\nMiddle Ages, owes its origin to the same tradition, as Frederick Engels\r\nobserves. The landlord, who, as master of his dependents and serfs,\r\nlooked upon himself as their chief, exercised the right of the head of\r\nthe tribe, a right that he considered had passed over to himself as the\r\narbiter of their lives and existence.\r\n\r\nEchoes of the mother-right are further detected in the singular custom\r\namong some South American tribes, that, instead of the lying-in woman,\r\nthe man goes to bed, there acts like a woman in labor, and is tended by\r\nthe wife. The custom implies that the father recognizes the new born\r\nchild as his own. By imitating the pains of child-birth, the man fills\r\nthe fiction that the birth is also his work; that he, therefore, has a\r\nright to the child, who, according to the former custom, belonged to the\r\nmother and the mother's gens, respectively. The custom is said to have\r\nalso maintained itself among the Basques, who must be looked upon as a\r\npeople of primitive usages and customs. Likewise is the custom said to\r\nprevail among several mountain tribes in China. It prevailed until not\r\nlong since in Corsica.\r\n\r\nIn Greece likewise did woman become an article of purchase. So soon as\r\nshe stepped into the house of her marital lord, she ceased to exist for\r\nher family. This was symbolically expressed by burning before the door\r\nthe handsomely decked wagon which took her to the house of her husband.\r\nAmong the Ostiaks of Siberia, to this day, the father sells his\r\ndaughter: he chaffers with the representative of the bridegroom about\r\nthe price to be paid. Likewise among several African tribes, the same as\r\nin the days of Jacob, the custom is that a man who courts a maid, enters\r\nin the service of his future mother-in-law. Even with us, marriage by\r\npurchase has not died out: it prevails in bourgeois society worse than\r\never. Marriage for money, almost everywhere customary among the ruling\r\nclasses, is nothing other than marriage by purchase. Indeed, the\r\nmarriage gift, which in all civilized countries the bridegroom makes to\r\nthe bride, is but a symbol of the purchase of the wife as property.\r\n\r\nAlong with marriage by purchase, there was the custom of marriage by\r\nrape. The rape of women was a customary practice, not alone among the\r\nancient Jews, but everywhere in antiquity. It is met with among almost\r\nall nations. The best known historic instance is the rape of the Sabine\r\nwomen by the Romans. The rape of women was an easy remedy where women\r\nran short, as, according to the legend, happened to the early Romans; or\r\nwhere polygamy was the custom, as everywhere in the Orient. There it\r\nassumed large proportions during the supremacy of the Arabs, from the\r\nseventh to the twelfth century.\r\n\r\nSymbolically, the rape of woman still occurs, for instance among the\r\nAraucans of South Chile. While the friends of the bridegroom are\r\nnegotiating with the father of the bride, the bridegroom steals with his\r\nhorse into the neighborhood of the house, and seeks to capture the\r\nbride. So soon as he catches her, he throws her upon his horse, and\r\nmakes off with her to the woods. The men, women and children thereupon\r\nraise a great hue and cry, and seek to prevent the escape. But when the\r\nbridegroom has reached the thick of the woods, the marriage is\r\nconsidered consummated. This holds good also when the abduction takes\r\nplace against the will of the parents. Similar customs prevail among the\r\npeoples of Australia.\r\n\r\nAmong ourselves, the custom of \"wedding trips\" still reminds us of the\r\nformer rape of the wife: the bride is carried off from her domestic\r\nflock. On the other hand, the exchange of rings is a reminiscence of the\r\nsubjection and enchainment of the woman to the man. The custom\r\noriginated in Rome. The bride received an iron ring from her husband as\r\na sign of her bondage to him. Later the ring was made of gold; much\r\nlater the exchange of rings was introduced, as a sign of mutual union.\r\n\r\nThe old family ties of the gens had, accordingly, lost their foundation\r\nthrough the development of the conditions of production, and through\r\nthe rule of private property. Upon the abolition of the gens, grounded\r\non mother-right, the gens, grounded on the father-right first took its\r\nplace, although not for long, and with materially weakened functions.\r\nIts task was mainly to attend to the common religious affairs and to the\r\nceremonial of funerals: to safeguard the mutual obligation of protection\r\nand of help against violence: to enforce the right, and, in certain\r\ncases, the duty of marrying in the gens, in cases when rich heiresses or\r\nfemale orphans were concerned. The gens, furthermore, administered the\r\nstill existing common property. But the segmentation of handicraft from\r\nagriculture; the ever wider expansion of commerce; the founding of\r\ncities, rendered necessary by both of these; the conquest of booty and\r\nprisoners of war, the latter of which directly affected the\r\nhousehold,--all of these tore to shreds the conditions and bonds of eld.\r\nHandicraft had gradually subdivided itself into a larger number of\r\nseparate trades--weaving, pottery, iron-forging, the preparation of\r\narms, house and shipbuilding, etc. Accordingly, it pushed toward another\r\norganization. The ever further introduction of slavery, the admittance\r\nof strangers into the community,--these were all so many new and\r\nadditional elements that rendered the old constitution of society ever\r\nmore impossible.\r\n\r\nAlong with private property and the personal right of inheritance, class\r\ndistinctions and class contrasts came into existence. Rich\r\nproperty-owners drew together against those who owned less, or nothing.\r\nThe former sought to get into their own hands the public offices of the\r\nnew commonwealth, and to make them hereditary. Money, now become\r\nnecessary, created thitherto unknown forms of indebtedness. Wars against\r\nenemies from without, and conflicting interests within, as well as the\r\nvarious interests and relations which agriculture, handicraft and\r\ncommerce mutually produced rendered necessary complicated rules of\r\nright, they demanded special organs to guard the orderly movement of the\r\nsocial machinery, and to settle disputes. The same held good for the\r\nrelations of master and slave, creditor and debtor. A power,\r\naccordingly, became necessary to supervise, lead, regulate and harmonize\r\nall these relations, with authority to protect, and, when needed, to\r\npunish. _Thus rose the State, the product, accordingly of the\r\nconflicting interests that sprang up in the new social order._ Its\r\nadministration naturally fell into the hands of those who had the\r\nliveliest interest in its establishment, and who, in virtue of their\r\nsocial power, possessed the greatest influence,--the rich. Aristocracy\r\nof property and democracy confronted each other, accordingly, even there\r\nwhere externally complete equality of political rights existed.\r\n\r\nUnder the mother-right, there was no written law. The relations were\r\nsimple, and custom was held sacred. Under the new, and much more\r\ncomplicated order, written law was one of the most important\r\nrequirements; and special organs became necessary to administer it. In\r\nthe measure that the legal relations and legal conditions gained in\r\nintricacy, a special class of people gathered shape, who made the study\r\nof the law their special vocation, and who finally had a special\r\ninterest in rendering the law ever more complicated. Then arose the men\r\nlearned in the laws, the jurists, who, due to the importance of the\r\nstatutory law to the whole of society, rose to influential social rank.\r\nThe new system of rights found in the course of time its classic\r\nexpression in the Roman State, whence the influence that Roman law\r\nexercises down to the present.\r\n\r\nThe institution of the State is, accordingly, the necessary result of a\r\nsocial order, that, standing upon the higher plane of the subdivision of\r\nlabor, is broken up into a large number of occupations, animated by\r\ndifferent, frequently conflicting, interests, and hence has the\r\noppression of the weaker for a consequence. This fact was recognized\r\neven by an Arabian tribe, the Nabateans, who, according to Diodorus,\r\nestablished the regulation not to sow, not to plant, to drink no wine,\r\nand to build no houses, but to live in tents, because if those things\r\nwere done, _they could be easily compelled to obey by a superior power_\r\n(the power of the State). Likewise among the Rachebites, the descendants\r\nof the father-in-law of Moses, there existed similar prescriptions.[17]\r\nAye, the whole Mosaic system of laws is aimed at _preventing the Jews\r\nfrom moving out of an agricultural state, because otherwise, so the\r\nlegislators feared, their democratic-communistic society would go\r\nunder_. Hence the selection of the \"Promised Land\" in a region bounded,\r\non one side, by a not very accessible mountain range, the Lebanon; on\r\nthe other side, South and East, by but slightly fertile stretches of\r\nland, partly by deserts;--a region, accordingly, that rendered isolation\r\npossible. Hence came the keeping of the Jews away from the sea, which\r\nfavored commerce, colonization and the accumulation of wealth; hence the\r\nrigid laws concerning seclusion from other peoples, the severe\r\nregulations against foreign marriages, the poor laws, the agrarian laws,\r\nthe jubileum,--all of them provisions calculated to prevent the\r\naccumulation of great wealth by the individual. The Jewish people were\r\nto be kept in permanent disability ever to become the builders of a real\r\nState. Hence it happens that the tribal organization, which rested upon\r\nthe gentile order, remained in force with them till its complete\r\ndissolution, and continues to affect them even now.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the Latin tribes, which took a hand in the founding of\r\nRome, had long passed beyond the stage of the mother-right. Hence Rome\r\nwas built from the start as a State. The women that they needed they\r\ncaptured, as the legend tells us, from the tribe of the Sabines, and\r\nthey called themselves after their Sabine wives,--Quirites. Even in\r\nlater years, the Roman citizens were addressed in the Forum as Quirites.\r\n\"Populus Romanus\" stood for the free population of Rome in general; but\r\n\"Populus Romanus quiritium\" expressed the ancestry and quality of the\r\nRoman citizen. The Roman gens was of father-right stamp. The children\r\ninherited as consanguineous heirs; if there were no children, the\r\nrelatives of the male line inherited; were none of these in existence,\r\nthen the property reverted to the gens. By marriage, woman lost her\r\nright to inherit her father's property and that of his brothers. She had\r\nstepped out of her gens: neither she nor her children could inherit from\r\nher father or his brothers: otherwise the inheritance would be lost to\r\nthe paternal gens. The division in gentes, phratries and tribes\r\nconstituted in Rome for centuries the foundation of the military\r\norganization, and also of the exercise of the rights of citizenship. But\r\nwith the decay of the paternal gentes and the decline of their\r\nsignificance, conditions shaped themselves more favorably for woman. She\r\ncould not only inherit, but had the right to administer her own fortune.\r\nShe was, accordingly, far more favorably situated than her Greek sister.\r\nThe freer position that, despite all legal impediments, she gradually\r\nknew how to conquer, caused the elder Cato, born 234 before our\r\nreckoning, to complain: \"If, after the example of his ancestors, every\r\nhead of a family kept his wife in proper subjection, we would not have\r\nso much public bother with the whole sex.\"[18]\r\n\r\nSo long as the father lived, he held in Rome the guardianship over his\r\ndaughter, even if she were married, unless he appointed another guardian\r\nhimself. When the father died, the nearest male of kin, even though\r\ndeclared unqualified as an agnate, came in as guardian. The guardian had\r\nthe right at any time to transfer the guardianship to any third person\r\nthat he pleased. Accordingly, before the law, the Roman woman had no\r\nwill of her own.\r\n\r\nThe nuptial forms were various, and in the course of centuries underwent\r\nmanifold alterations. The most solemn nuptials were celebrated before\r\nthe High Priest, in the presence of at least ten witnesses. At the\r\noccasion, the bridal pair, in token of their union, partook together\r\nfrom a cake made of flour, salt and water. As will be noticed, a\r\nceremony is here celebrated, that bears great resemblance to the\r\nbreaking of the sacramental wafer at the Christian communion. A second\r\nform of nuptials consisted in possession. The marriage was considered\r\naccomplished if, with the consent of her father or guardian, a woman\r\nlived with the chosen man a whole year under one roof. A third form of\r\nnuptials was a sort of mutual purchase, both sides exchanging coins, and\r\nthe promise to be man and wife. Already at the time of Cicero[19] free\r\ndivorce for both sides was generally established; it was even debated\r\nwhether the announcement of the divorce was necessary. The \"lex Julia de\r\nadulteriis,\" however, prescribed that the divorce was to be solemnly\r\nproclaimed. This decree was made for the reason that women, who\r\ncommitted adultery, and were summoned to answer the charge, often\r\nclaimed to have been divorced. Justinian, the Christian[20] forbade free\r\ndivorce, unless both sides desired to retire to a monastery. His\r\nsuccessor, Justinian II, however, found himself obliged to allow it\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nWith the growing power and rising wealth of Rome, mad-brained vices and\r\nexcesses took the place of the former severity of manners. Rome became\r\nthe center from which debauchery, riotous luxury and sensuous\r\nrefinements radiated over the whole of the then civilized world. The\r\nexcesses took--especially during the time of the Emperors, and, to a\r\ngreat extent, through the Emperors themselves--forms that only insanity\r\ncould suggest. Men and women vied with one another in vice. The number\r\nof houses of prostitution became ever larger, and, hand in hand with\r\nthese, the \"Greek love\" (pederasty) spread itself ever more among the\r\nmale population. At times, the number of young men in Rome who\r\nprostituted themselves was larger than that of the female prostitutes.\r\n\r\n\"The hetairae appeared, surrounded by their admirers, in great pomp on\r\nthe streets, promenades, the circus and theatres, often carried by\r\nnegroes upon litters, where, holding a mirror in their hands, and\r\nsparkling with ornaments and precious stones, they lay outstretched,\r\nnude, fan-carrying slaves standing by them, and surrounded by a swarm of\r\nboys, eunuchs and flute-players; grotesque dwarfs closed the\r\nprocession.\"\r\n\r\nThese excesses assumed such proportions in the Roman Empire that they\r\nbecame a danger to the Empire itself. The example of the men was\r\nfollowed by the women. There were women, Seneca reports, who counted the\r\nyears, not as was the usage, after the consuls, but after the number of\r\ntheir husbands. Adultery was general; and, in order that the women might\r\nescape the severe punishments prescribed for the offense, they, and\r\namong them the leading dames of Rome, caused themselves to be entered in\r\nthe registers of the Aediles as prostitutes.\r\n\r\nHand in hand with these excesses, civil wars and the latifundia system,\r\ncelibacy and childlessness increased in such measure that the number of\r\nRoman citizens and of patricians ran down considerably. Hence in the\r\nyear 16 B. C., Augustus issued the so-called Julian Law,[21] which\r\noffered prizes for the birth of children, and imposed penalties for\r\ncelibacy upon the Roman citizens and patricians. He who had children\r\nhad precedence in rank over the childless and unmarried. Bachelors could\r\naccept no inheritance, except from their own nearest kin. The childless\r\ncould only inherit one-half; the rest fell to the State. Women, who\r\ncould be taxed with adultery, had to surrender one-half of their dower\r\nto the abused husband. Thereupon there were men who married out of\r\nspeculation on the adultery of their wives. This caused Plutarch to\r\nobserve: \"The Romans marry, not to obtain heirs, but to inherit.\"\r\n\r\nStill later the Julian Law was made severer. Tiberius decreed that no\r\nwoman, whose grandfather, father or husband had been or still was a\r\nRoman Knight, could prostitute herself for money. Married women, who\r\ncaused themselves to be entered in the registers of prostitutes, were\r\ncondemned to banishment from Italy as adulteresses. Of course, there\r\nwere no such punishments for the men. Moreover, as Juvenal reports, even\r\nthe murder of husbands by poison was a frequent occurrence in the Rome\r\nof his day--the first half of the first century before Christ.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Bachofen's book appeared in 1861 under the title, \"Das Mutterrecht\"\r\n(Mother-right) \"Eine Untersuchung ueber die Gynaekokratie der Alten Welt\r\nnach ihrer religioesen und rechtlichen Natur,\" Stuttgart, Krais &\r\nHoffmann.

Neither Bachofen, nor yet Tylor, McLennan or Lubbock\r\ncontributed to the principles that now are canons in ethnology. They\r\nwere not even path-finders, valuable though their works are.\r\n\r\nBachofen collected, in his work entitled \"Das Mutterrecht,\" the\r\ngleanings of vast and tireless researches among the writings of the\r\nancients, with an eye to female authority. Subsequently, and helping\r\nthemselves more particularly to the more recent contributions to\r\narcheology, that partly dealt with living aborigines, Tylor, McLennan\r\nand Lubbock produced respectively, \"Early History of Mankind;\"\r\n\"Primitive Marriage;\" and \"Pre-Historic Times\" and \"Origin of\r\nCivilization.\" These works, though partly theoretic, yet are mainly\r\ndescriptive. By an effort of genius--like the wood-pecker, whose\r\ninstinct tells it the desired worm is beneath the bark and who pecks at\r\nand round about it--all these men, Bachofen foremost, scented sense in\r\nthe seeming nonsense of ancient traditions, or surmised significance in\r\nthe more recently ascertained customs of living aborigines. But again,\r\nlike the wood-pecker, that has struck a bark too thick for its bill,\r\nthese men could not solve the problem they were at. They lacked the\r\ninformation to pick, and they had not, nor were they so situated as to\r\nfurnish themselves with, the key to open the lock. Morgan furnished the\r\nkey.\r\n\r\nLewis Henry Morgan, born In Aurora, N. Y., November 21, 1818, and\r\nequipped with vast scholarship and archeological information, took up\r\nhis residence among the Iroquois Indians, by whom, the Hawk gens of the\r\nSeneca tribe, he was eventually adopted. The fruit of his observations\r\nthere and among other Indian tribes that he visited even west of the\r\nMississippi, together with simultaneous information sent him by the\r\nAmerican missionaries in the Sandwich Islands, was a series of\r\nepoch-making works, \"The League of the Iroquois,\" \"Systems of\r\nConsanguinity and Affinity of the Human Family,\" and \"Ancient Society,\"\r\nwhich appeared in 1877. A last and not least valuable work was his\r\n\"Houses and Houselife of the American Aborigines.\" A solid foundation\r\nwas now laid for the science of ethnology and anthropology. The problem\r\nwas substantially solved.\r\n\r\nThe robust scientific mind of Karl Marx promptly absorbed the\r\nrevelations made by Morgan, and he recast his own views accordingly. A\r\nserious ethnological error had crept into his great work, \"Capital,\" two\r\neditions of which had been previously published in German between\r\n1863-1873. A footnote by Frederick Engels (p. 344, Swan, Sonnenschein &\r\nCo., English edition, 1886) testifies to the revolution Morgan's works\r\nhad wrought on the ethnological conceptions of the founder of Socialist\r\neconomics and sociology.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, Frederick Engels, planted squarely on the principles\r\nestablished by Morgan, issued a series of brilliant monographs, in\r\nwhich, equipped with the key furnished by Morgan and which Engels'\r\nextensive economic and sociologic knowledge enabled him to wield with\r\ndeftness, he explained interesting social phenomena among the ancients,\r\nand thereby greatly enriched the literature of social science.\r\n\r\nFinally, Heinrich Cunow, though imagining to perceive some minor flaws\r\nin some secondary parts of Morgan's theory, placed himself in absolute\r\naccord with the body of Morgan's real work, as stated later in the text\r\nin a quotation from Cunow; and, following closely in Morgan's footsteps,\r\nmade and published interesting independent researches on the system of\r\nconsanguinity among the Austral-Negros.--THE TRANSLATOR.]\r\n\r\n[2] In his book against us, Ziegler ridicules the idea of attributing to\r\nmyths any significance whatever in the history of civilization. In that\r\nnotion stands betrayed the superficial nature of so-called scientists.\r\nThey do not recognize what they do not see. A deep significance lies at\r\nthe bottom of myths. They have grown out of the people's soul; out of\r\nolden morals and customs that have gradually disappeared, and now\r\ncontinue to live only in the myth. When we strike facts that explain a\r\nmyth we are in possession of solid ground for its interpretation.\r\n\r\n[3] Bachofen: \"Das Mutterrecht.\"\r\n\r\n[4] Totem-group means generation-group.

The latter exists mainly\r\namong the highland people of Thibet, among the Garras on the\r\nHindoo-Chinese frontier, among the Baigas in Godwana, the Nairs in the\r\nsouthern extremity of India; it is said to be found also among the\r\nEskimos and Aleutians. Heredity is determined in the only way\r\npossible,--after the mother: the children belong to her. The husbands of\r\na woman are usually brothers. When the elder brother marries, the other\r\nbrothers likewise become the husbands of the woman; the woman, however,\r\npreserves the right to take other men besides. Conversely, the men also\r\nare said to have the right of taking a second, third, fourth, or more\r\nwives. To what circumstances polyandry owes its origin is not yet clear.\r\nSeeing that the polyandrous nations, without exception, live either on\r\nhigh mountain regions, or in the cold zone, polyandry probably owes its\r\nexistence to a phenomenon that Tarnowsky comments on.[22] He learned\r\nfrom reliable travelers that a long sojourn at high elevations lowers\r\nthe sensuous pleasures, and weakens erection, both of which return with\r\nnew vigor by re-descension to lower altitudes. This lowering of the\r\nsexual powers, Tarnowsky is of the opinion, might partly account for the\r\ncomparative slight increase of population on highland regions; and he is\r\nof the opinion that, when the debility is transmitted, it may become a\r\nsource of degeneration that operates upon the perversity of the sexual\r\nsense.\r\n\r\nWe may also add that a protracted domicile, together with the habits of\r\nlife contracted on very high or cold regions, may have for a further\r\nresult that polyandry lays no excessive demands upon a woman. The women\r\nthemselves are correspondingly affected in their nature. That they are\r\nso is rendered probable by the circumstance that, among the Eskimo\r\ngirls, menstruation sets in only with the nineteenth year, whereas in\r\nthe warm zones it sets in as early as the tenth or eleventh, and in the\r\ntemperate latitudes between the fourteenth and the sixteenth year. In\r\nview of the fact that warm climates, as universally recognized, exercise\r\na strongly stimulating influence upon the sexual instinct,--whence\r\npolygamy finds its widest diffusion in warm countries--it is quite\r\nlikely that cold regions--to which high mountains and plateaus belong,\r\nand where the thinner air may also contribute its share--may exercise\r\nmaterially a restringent effect upon the sexual instinct. It must,\r\nmoreover, be noted that experience shows conception occurs rarer with\r\nwomen who cohabit with several men. The increase of population is,\r\naccordingly, slight under polyandry; and it fits in with the difficulty\r\nof securing subsistence, encountered in cold lands and mountain\r\nregions;--whereby additional proof is furnished that also, in this, to\r\nus so seemingly strange phenomenon of polyandry, production has its\r\ndetermining influence upon the relations of the sexes. Finally, it is to\r\nbe ascertained whether among these peoples, who live on high mountains\r\nor in cold zones, the killing of girl babies is not a frequent practice,\r\nas is oft reported of the Mongolian tribes, on the highlands of China.\r\n\r\nExactly the reverse of the custom among the Romans during the Empire, of\r\nallowing celibacy and childlessness to gain the upper hand, was the\r\ncustom prevalent among the Jews. True enough, the Jewish woman had no\r\nright to choose; her father fixed upon the husband she was to wed; but\r\nmarriage was a duty, that they religiously followed. The Talmud advises:\r\n\"When your daughter is of marriageable age, give his freedom to one of\r\nyour slaves and engage her to him.\" In the same sense the Jews followed\r\nstrictly the command of their God: \"Increase and multiply.\" Due to this,\r\nand despite all persecutions and oppression, they have diligently\r\nincreased their numbers. The Jew is the sworn enemy of Malthusianism.\r\n\r\nAlready Tacitus says of them: \"Among themselves there is a stubborn\r\nholding together, and ready open-handedness; but, for all others,\r\nhostile hatred. Never do they eat, never do they sleep with foes; and,\r\nalthough greatly inclined to sensuousness, they abstain from procreation\r\nwith foreign women. Nevertheless they strive to increase their people.\r\nInfanticide is held a sin with them; and the souls of those who die in\r\nbattle or by execution they consider immortal. Hence the love of\r\nprocreation beside their contempt of death.\" Tacitus hated and abhorred\r\nthe Jews, because, in contempt of the religion of their fathers, they\r\nheaped up wealth and treasures. He called them the \"worst set of\r\npeople,\" an \"ugly race.\"[23]\r\n\r\nUnder the over-lordship of the Romans, the Jews drew ever closer\r\ntogether. Under the long period of sufferings, which, from that time on,\r\nthey had to endure, almost throughout the whole of the Christian Middle\r\nAges, grew that intimate family life that is to-day considered a sort of\r\npattern by the modern bourgeois _regime_. On the other side, Roman\r\nsociety underwent the process of disintegration and dissolution, which\r\nled the Empire to its destruction. Upon the excesses, bordering on\r\ninsanity, followed the other extreme,--the most rigid abstinence. As\r\nexcess, in former days, now asceticism assumed religious forms. A\r\ndream-land-fanaticism made propaganda for it. The unbounded gluttony and\r\nluxury of the ruling classes stood in glaring contrast with the want and\r\nmisery of the millions upon millions that conquering Rome dragged, from\r\nall the then known countries of the world, into Italy and slavery. Among\r\nthese were also numberless women, who, separated from their domestic\r\nhearths, from their parents or their husbands, and torn from their\r\nchildren, felt their misery most keenly, and yearned for deliverance. A\r\nlarge number of Roman women, disgusted at that which happened all around\r\nthem, found themselves in similar frame of mind; any change in their\r\ncondition seemed to them a relief. A deep longing for a change, for\r\ndeliverance, took possession of extensive social layers;--and the\r\ndeliverer seemed to approach. The conquest of Jerusalem and of the\r\nJewish kingdom by the Romans had for its consequence the destruction of\r\nall national independence, and begot among the ascetic sects of that\r\ncountry, dreamers, who announced the birth of a new kingdom, that was to\r\nbring freedom and happiness to all.\r\n\r\nChrist came, and Christianity arose. It embodied the opposition to the\r\nbestial materialism that reigned among the great and the rich of the\r\nRoman Empire; it represented the revolt against the contempt for and\r\noppression of the masses. But originating in Judaism, which knew woman\r\nonly as a being bereft of all rights, and biased by the Biblical\r\nconception which saw in her the source of all evil, Christianity\r\npreached contempt for woman. It also preached abstinence, the\r\nmortification of the flesh, then so sinful, and it pointed with its\r\nambiguous phrases to a prospective kingdom, which some interpreted as of\r\nheaven, others as of earth, and which was to bring freedom and justice\r\nto all. With these doctrines it found fertile ground in the submerged\r\nbottom of the Roman Empire. Woman, hoping, along with all the miserable,\r\nfor freedom and deliverance from her condition, joined readily and\r\nzealously. Down to our own days, never yet was a great and important\r\nmovement achieved in the world without women also having been\r\nconspicuously active as combatants and martyrs. Those who praise\r\nChristianity as a great achievement of civilization should not forget\r\nthat it was woman in particular to whom Christianity owes a great part\r\nof its success. Her proselyting zeal played a weighty _role_ in the\r\nRoman Empire, as well as among the barbarous peoples of the Middle Ages.\r\nThe mightiest were by her converted to Christianity. It was Clotilde,\r\nfor instance, who moved Clovis, the King of the Franks, to accept\r\nChristianity; it was, again, Bertha, Queen of Kent, and Gisela, Queen of\r\nHungary, who introduced Christianity in their countries. To the\r\ninfluence of the women is due the conversion of many of the great. But\r\nChristianity requited woman ill. Its tenets breathe the same contempt\r\nfor woman that is breathed in all the religions of the East. It orders\r\nher to be the obedient servant of her husband, and the vow of obedience\r\nshe must, to this day, make to him at the altar.\r\n\r\nLet us hear the Bible and Christianity speak of woman and marriage. The\r\nten commandments are addressed only to the men; in the tenth commandment\r\nwoman is bracketed with servants and domestic animals. Man is warned not\r\nto covet his neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maid-servant,\r\nnor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is his. Woman, accordingly,\r\nappears as an object, as a piece of property, that the man may not\r\nhanker after, if in another's possession. Jesus, who belonged to a\r\nsect--the sect which imposed upon itself strict asceticism and even\r\nself-emasculation[24]--being asked by his disciples whether it is good\r\nto marry, answers: \"All men cannot receive this saying, save they to\r\nwhom it is given. For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from\r\ntheir mother's womb; and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs\r\nof men; and there be eunuchs, _which have made themselves eunuchs for\r\nthe kingdom of heaven's sake_.\"[25] Emasculation is, according hereto,\r\nan act hallowed by God, and the renunciation of love and marriage a good\r\ndeed.\r\n\r\nPaul, who, in a higher degree than even Jesus himself, may be called the\r\nfounder of the Christian religion; Paul, who first impressed an\r\ninternational character upon this creed, and tore it away from the\r\nnarrow sectarianism of the Jews, writes to the Corinthians: \"Now\r\nconcerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: \"It is good for a man\r\nnot to touch a woman;\" \"he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but\r\nhe that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.\"[26] \"Walk in the\r\nSpirit and fulfil not the lust of the flesh, for the flesh lusteth\r\nagainst the Spirit and the Spirit against the flesh;\" \"they that are\r\nChrist's have crucified the flesh, with the affections and lusts.\"\" He\r\nfollowed his own precepts, and did not marry. This hatred of the flesh\r\n_is the hatred of woman, but also the fear of woman_, who--see the scene\r\nin Paradise--is represented as the seducer of man. In this spirit did\r\nthe Apostles and the Fathers of the Church preach; in this spirit did\r\nthe Church work throughout the whole of the Middle Ages, when it reared\r\nits cloisters, and introduced celibacy among the priesthood;--and to\r\nthis day it works in the same spirit.\r\n\r\nAccording to Christianity, woman is the _unclean being_; the seducer,\r\nwho introduced sin into the world and ruined man. Hence Apostles, and\r\nFathers of the Church alike, have ever looked upon marriage as a\r\nnecessary evil,--the same as is said to-day of prostitution. Tertulian\r\nexclaims: \"Woman, thou should ever walk in mourning and rags, thy eyes\r\nfull of tears, present the aspect of repentance to induce forgetfulness\r\nof your having ruined the human race. Woman, thou art the Gate of Hell!\"\r\nHieronymus says: \"Marriage always is a vice; all that we can do is to\r\nexcuse and cleanse it,\" hence it was made a sacrament of the Church.\r\nOrigen declares: \"Marriage is something unholy and unclean, a means for\r\nsensuality,\" and, in order to resist the temptation, he emasculated\r\nhimself. Tertulian declares: \"Celibacy is preferable, even if the human\r\nrace goes to ground.\" Augustine teaches: \"The celibates will shine in\r\nheaven like brilliant stars, while their parents (who brought them\r\nforth) are like dark stars.\" Eusebius and Hieronymus agree that the\r\nBiblical command, \"Increase and multiply,\" no longer fits the times, and\r\ndoes not concern the Christians. Hundreds of other quotations from the\r\nmost influential Fathers of the Church could be cited, all of which tend\r\nin the same direction. By means of their continuous teaching and\r\npreaching, they have spread those unnatural views touching sexual\r\nmatters, and the intercourse of the sexes, _the latter of which,\r\nnevertheless, remains a commandment of nature, and obedience to which is\r\none of the most important duties in the mission of life_. Modern society\r\nis still severely ailing from these teachings, and it is recovering but\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\nPeter calls out emphatically to women: \"Ye wives, be in subjection to\r\nyour own husbands.\"[27] Paul writes to the Ephesians: \"The husband is\r\nthe head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the Church;\"[28] and\r\nin Corinthians: \"Man is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the\r\nglory of the man.\"[29] According to which every sot of a man may hold\r\nhimself better than the most distinguished woman;--indeed, it is so in\r\npractice to-day. Also against the higher education of women does Paul\r\nraise his weighty voice: \"Let the woman learn in silence with all\r\n_subjection_. _But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority\r\nover the man, out to be in silence_;\"[30] and again: \"Let your women\r\n_keep silence_ in the churches; _for it is not permitted unto them to\r\nspeak; but they are commanded to be under obedience_, as also saith the\r\nlaw. And if they will learn anything, _let them ask their husbands at\r\nhome; for it is a shame for women to speak in the church_.\"[31]\r\n\r\nSuch doctrines are not peculiar to Christianity only. Christianity being\r\na mixture of Judaism and Greek philosophy, and seeing that these, in\r\nturn, have their roots in the older civilization of the Egyptians,\r\nBabylonians, and Hindoos, the subordinate position that Christianity\r\nassigned to woman was one common in antiquity. In the Hindoo laws of\r\nManu it is said regarding woman: \"The source of dishonor is woman; the\r\nsource of strife is woman; the source of earthly existence is woman;\r\ntherefore avoid woman.\" Beside this degradation of woman, fear of her\r\never and anon reappears naively. Manu further sets forth: \"Woman is by\r\nnature ever inclined to tempt man; hence a man should not sit in a\r\nsecluded place even with his nearest female relative.\" Woman,\r\naccordingly, is, according to the Hindoo as well as the Old Testament\r\nand Christian view, everywhere the tempter. All masterhood implies the\r\ndegradation of the mastered. The subordinate position of woman\r\ncontinues, to this day, even more in force in the backward civilization\r\nof the East than among the nations that enjoy a so-called Christian\r\nview-point. That which, in the so-called Christian world, gradually\r\nimproved the situation of woman was, not Christianity, but _the advanced\r\nculture of the West struggling against the Christian doctrine_.\r\n\r\nChristianity is guiltless of woman's present improved position to what\r\nit was at the start of the era. Only reluctantly, and forced thereto,\r\ndid Christianity become untrue to its true spirit with regard to woman.\r\nThose who rave about \"the mission of Christianity to emancipate\r\nmankind,\" differ from us in this, as in other respects. They claim that\r\nChristianity freed woman from her previous low position, and they ground\r\nthemselves upon the worship of Mary, the \"mother of God,\"--a cult,\r\nhowever, that sprang up only later in Christendom, but which they point\r\nto as a sign of regard for the whole sex. The Roman Catholic Church,\r\nwhich celebrates this cult, should be the last to lay claim to such a\r\ndoctrine. The Saints and Fathers of the Church, cited above, and whose\r\nutterances could be easily multiplied--and they are the leading Church\r\nauthorities--express themselves separately and collectively hostile to\r\nwoman and to marriage. The Council of Macon, which, in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, discussed the question whether woman had a soul, and which\r\ndecided with a majority of but one vote, that she had, likewise argues\r\nagainst the theory of such a friendly posture towards woman. The\r\nintroduction of celibacy by Gregory VII[32]--although resorted to first\r\nof all and mainly with the end in view of holding in the unmarried\r\npriesthood a power that could not be alienated from the service of the\r\nChurch through any family interests--was, nevertheless, possible only\r\nwith such fundamental doctrines as the Church held touching the\r\nsinfulness of the lusts of the flesh; and it goes to confirm our theory.\r\n\r\nNeither did the Reformers, especially Calvin and the Scotch ministers,\r\nwith their wrath at the \"lusts of the flesh,\" entertain any doubt\r\ntouching the hostile posture of Christianity towards woman.[33]\r\n\r\nBy the introduction of the cult of Mary, the Roman Catholic Church\r\nshrewdly placed the worship of Mary in the place of that of the heathen\r\ngoddesses, in vogue among _all_ the people over whom Christianity was\r\nthen extending itself. _Mary_ took the place of the Cybele, the Mylitta,\r\nthe Aphrodite, the Venus, the Ceres, etc., of the southern races; of the\r\nFreia, the Frigga, etc., of the Germanian tribes. She was a mere\r\nspiritually-Christian idealization.\r\n\r\nThe primeval, physically robust, though rude yet uncorrupted races,\r\nthat, during the first centuries of our reckoning, crowded down from the\r\nNorth and East like a gigantic ocean wave, and swamped the worn-out\r\nuniversal Empire of Rome, where Christianity had gradually been\r\nsuperimposing itself as master, resisted with all their might the\r\nascetic doctrines of the Christian preachers. With good grace or bad,\r\nthe latter were forced to reckon with these robust natures. With\r\nastonishment did the Romans perceive that the customs of those peoples\r\nwere quite different from their own. Tacitus rendered to this fact the\r\ntribute of his acknowledgment, which, with regard to the Germans, he\r\nexpressed in these words: \"The matrimonial bond is, nevertheless, strict\r\nand severe among them; nor is there anything in their manners more\r\ncommendable than this. Almost singly among the barbarians, they content\r\nthemselves with one wife. Adultery is extremely rare among so numerous a\r\npeople. Its punishment is instant, and at the pleasure of the husband.\r\nHe cuts off the hair of the offender, strips her, and in the presence of\r\nher relations expels her from his house, and pursues her with stripes\r\nthrough the whole village. Nor is any indulgence shown to a prostitute.\r\nNeither beauty, youth, nor riches can procure her a husband; for none\r\nthere looks on vice with a smile, or calls mutual seduction the way of\r\nthe world. The youths partake late of the pleasures of love, and hence\r\npass the age of puberty unexhausted; nor are the virgins hurried into\r\nmarriage; the same maturity, the same full growth is required; the sexes\r\nunite equally matched, and robust; and the children inherit the vigor of\r\ntheir parents.\"\r\n\r\nWith the object in view of holding up a pattern to the Romans, Tacitus\r\npainted the conjugal conditions of the old Germans with rather too rosy\r\na hue. No doubt, the adulteress was severely punished among them; but\r\nthe same did not hold good with regard to the adulterer. At the time of\r\nTacitus, the gens was still in bloom among the Germans. He, to whom,\r\nliving under the advanced Roman conditions, the old gentile\r\nconstitution, together with its principles, was bound to seem strange\r\nand incomprehensible, narrates with astonishment that, with the Germans,\r\nthe mother's brother, considered his nephew as an own son; aye, some\r\nlooked upon the bond of consanguinity between the uncle on the mother's\r\nside and his nephew as more sacred and closer than that between father\r\nand son. So that, when hostages were demanded, the sister's son was\r\nconsidered a better guarantee than an own son. Engels adds hereto: \"If\r\nan own son was given by the members of such a gens as a pledge for a\r\ntreaty, and he fell a sacrifice through his own father's violation of\r\nthe treaty, the latter had to settle accounts for himself. If, however,\r\nit was a sister's son who was sacrificed, then the old gentile right was\r\nviolated. The nearest gentile relative, held before all others to\r\nsafeguard the boy or lad, had caused his death; he either had no right\r\nto offer him as a pledge, or he was bound to observe the treaty.\"[34]\r\n\r\nFor the rest, as Engels shows, the mother-right had already yielded to\r\nthe father-right among the Germans, at the time of Tacitus. The children\r\ninherited from their father; in the absence of these, then the brothers\r\nand the uncle of the father on the mother's side. The admission of the\r\nmother's brother as an heir, although descent from the father determined\r\nthe line of inheritance, is explained with the theory that the old right\r\nhad only recently died away. It was only reminiscences of the old right\r\nthat furnished the conditions, which enabled Tacitus to find a, to the\r\nRomans, incomprehensible regard for the female sex among the Germans. He\r\nalso found that their courage was pricked to the utmost by the women.\r\nThe thought that their women might fall into captivity or slavery was\r\nthe most horrible that the old German could conceive of; it spurred him\r\nto utmost resistance. But the women also were animated by the spirit\r\nthat possessed the men. When Marius refused the captured women of the\r\nTeutons to dedicate themselves as priestesses to Vesta (the goddess of\r\nmaidenly chastity) they committed suicide.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Tacitus, the Germans already acquired settled\r\nhabitations. Yearly the division of land by lots took place. Besides\r\nthat, there was common property in the woods, water and pasture grounds.\r\nTheir lives were yet simple; their wealth principally cattle; their\r\ndress consisted of coarse woolen mantles, or skins of animals. Neither\r\nwomen nor chiefs wore under-clothing. The working of metals was in\r\npractice only among those tribes located too far away for the\r\nintroduction of Roman products of industry. Justice was administered in\r\nminor affairs by the council of elders; on more important matters, by\r\nthe assembly of the people. The chiefs were elected, generally out of\r\nthe same family, but the transition of the father-right favored the\r\nheredity of office, and led finally to the establishment of a hereditary\r\nnobility, from which later sprang the kingdom. As in Greece and Rome,\r\nthe German gens went to pieces with the rise of private property and the\r\ndevelopment of industries and trade, and through the commingling with\r\nmembers of strange tribes and peoples. The place of the gens was taken\r\nby the community, the mark, the democratic organization of free\r\npeasants, the latter of which, in the course of many centuries,\r\nconstituted a firm bulwark in the struggles against the nobility, the\r\nChurch and the Princes,--a bulwark that broke down by little and little,\r\nbut that did not wholly crumble even after the feudal State had come to\r\npower, and the one-time free peasants were in droves reduced to the\r\ncondition of serfs and dependents.\r\n\r\nThe confederation of marks was represented by the heads of the families.\r\nMarried women, daughters, daughters-in-law were excluded from council\r\nand administration. The time when women were conspicuous in the conduct\r\nof the affairs of the tribe--a circumstance that likewise astonished\r\nTacitus in the highest degree, and which he reports in terms of\r\ncontempt--were gone. The Salic law abolished in the fifth century of our\r\nreckoning the succession of the female sex to hereditary domains.\r\n\r\nSoon as he married, every member of a mark was entitled to a share in\r\nthe common lands. As a rule, grand-parents, parents and children lived\r\nunder one roof, in communal household. Hence, with a view of being\r\nallotted a further share, under-aged or unripe sons were not\r\ninfrequently married by their father to some marriageable maiden; the\r\nfather then filled the duties of husband, in the stead of his son.[35]\r\nYoung married couples received a cart-load of beechwood, and timber for\r\na block-house. If a daughter was born to the couple, they received one\r\nload of wood; if a son, two loads.[36] The female sex was considered\r\nworth only one-half.\r\n\r\n_Marriage was simple. A religious formality was unknown. Mutual\r\ndeclarations sufficed. As soon as a couple mounted the nuptial bed, the\r\nmarriage was consummated._ The custom that marriage needs an act of the\r\nChurch for its validity, came in only in the ninth century. Only in the\r\nsixteenth century, on decree of the Council of Trent, was marriage\r\ndeclared a sacrament of the Roman Catholic Church.\r\n\r\nWith the rise of feudalism, the condition of a large number of the\r\nmembers of the free communities declined. The victorious army-commanders\r\nutilized their power to appropriate large territories unto themselves;\r\nthey considered themselves masters of the common property, which they\r\ndistributed among their devoted retinue--slaves, serfs, freedmen,\r\ngenerally of foreign descent,--for a term of years, or with the right of\r\ninheritance. They thus furnished themselves with a court and military\r\nnobility, in all things devoted to their will. The establishment of the\r\nlarge Empire of the Franks finally put an end to the last vestiges of\r\nthe old gentile constitution. In the place of the former councils of\r\nchiefs, now stood the lieutenants of the army and of the newly formed\r\nnobility.\r\n\r\nGradually, the mass of the freemen, members of the once free\r\ncommunities, lapsed into exhaustion and poverty, due to the continuous\r\nwars of conquest and the strifes among the great, whose burdens they had\r\nto bear. They could no longer meet the obligation of furnishing the army\r\nrequisitions. In lieu thereof, Princes and high nobility secured\r\nservants, while the peasants placed themselves and their property under\r\nthe protection of some temporal or spiritual lord--the Church had\r\nmanaged, within but few centuries, to become a great power--wherefor\r\nthey paid rent and tribute. Thus the thitherto free peasant's estate was\r\ntransformed into hired property; and this, with time, was burdened with\r\never more obligations. Once landed in this state of dependence, it was\r\nnot long before the peasant lost his personal freedom also. In this way\r\ndependence and serfdom spread ever more.\r\n\r\nThe landlord possessed the almost absolute right of disposal over his\r\nserfs and dependents. He had the right, as soon as a male reached his\r\neighteenth year, or the female her fourteenth, to compel their marriage.\r\nHe could assign a woman to a man, and a man to a woman. He enjoyed the\r\nsame right over widows and widowers. In his attribute of lord over his\r\nsubjects, he also considered the sexual use of his female serfs and\r\ndependents to be at his own disposal,--a power that finds its expression\r\nin the \"jus primae noctis\" (the right of the first night). This right\r\nalso belonged to his representative, the stewart, unless, upon the\r\npayment of a tribute, the exercise of the right was renounced. The very\r\nnames of the tribute betray its nature.[37]\r\n\r\nIt is extensively disputed that this \"right of the first night\" ever\r\nexisted. The \"right of the first night\" is quite a thorn in the side of\r\ncertain folks, for the reason that the right was still exercised at an\r\nage, that they love to hold up as a model,--a genuine model of morality\r\nand piety. It has been pointed out how this \"right of the first night\"\r\nwas the rudiment of a custom, that hung together with the age of the\r\nmother-right, when all the women were the wives of all the men of a\r\nclass. With the disappearance of the old family organization, the custom\r\nsurvived in the surrender of the bride, on the wedding night, to the men\r\nof her own community. But, in the course of time, the right is ever more\r\nrestricted, and finally falls to the chief of the tribe, or to the\r\npriest, as a religious act, to be exercised by them alone. The feudal\r\nlord assumes the right as a consequence of his power over the person who\r\nbelongs to the land, and which is his property; and he exercises the\r\nright if he wills, or relinquishes it in lieu of a tribute in products\r\nor money. How real was the \"right of the first night\" appears from Jacob\r\nGrimm's \"Weisthumer.\"[38]\r\n\r\nSugenheim[39] says the \"jus primae noctis,\" as a right appertaining to\r\nthe landlords, originates in that his consent to marriage was necessary.\r\nOut of this right there arose in Bearn the usage that all the first-born\r\nof marriages, in which the \"jus primae noctis\" was exercised, were of\r\nfree rank. Later, the right was generally redeemable by a tribute.\r\nAccording to Sugenheim, those who held most stubbornly to the right were\r\nthe Bishops of Amiens; it lasted with them till the beginning of the\r\nfifteenth century. In Scotland the right was declared redeemable by King\r\nMalcolm III, towards the end of the eleventh century; in Germany,\r\nhowever, it continued in force much longer. According to the archives of\r\na Swabian cloister, Adelberg, for the year 1496, the serfs, located at\r\nBoertlingen, had to redeem the right by the bridegroom's giving a cake\r\nof salt, and the bride paying one pound seven shillings, or with a pan,\r\n\"in which she can sit with her buttocks.\" In other places the\r\nbridegrooms had to deliver to the landlord for ransom as much cheese or\r\nbutter \"as their buttocks were thick and heavy.\" In still other places\r\nthey had to give a handsome cordovan tarbouret \"that they could just\r\nfill.\"[40] According to the accounts given by the Bavarian Judge of the\r\nSupreme Court of Appeals, Welsch, the obligation to redeem the \"jus\r\nprimae noctis\" existed in Bavaria as late as the eighteenth\r\ncentury.[41] Furthermore, Engels reports that, among the Welsh and the\r\nScots, the \"right of the first night\" prevailed throughout the whole of\r\nthe Middle Ages, with the difference only that, due to the continuance\r\nof the gentile organization, it was not the landlord, or his\r\nrepresentative, but the chief of the clan, as the last representative of\r\nthe one-time husbands in common, who exercised the right, in so far as\r\nit was not redeemed.\r\n\r\nThere is, accordingly, no doubt whatever that the so-called \"right of\r\nthe first night\" existed, not only during the whole of the Middle Ages,\r\nbut continued even down to modern days, and played its _role_ under the\r\ncode of feudalism. In Poland, the noblemen arrogated the right to\r\ndeflower any maid they pleased, and a hundred lashes were given him who\r\ncomplained. That the sacrifice of maidenly honor seems even to-day a\r\nmatter of course to landlords and their officials in the country,\r\ntranspires, not only in Germany, oftener than one imagines, but it is a\r\nfrequent occurrence all over the East and South of Europe, as is\r\nasserted by experts in countries and the peoples.\r\n\r\nIn the days of feudalism, marriage was a matter of interest to the\r\nlandlord. The children that sprang therefrom entered into the same\r\nrelation of subjection to him as their parents; the labor-power at his\r\ndisposal increased in numbers, his income rose. Hence _spiritual_ and\r\n_temporal_ landlords favored marriage among their vassals. The matter\r\nlay otherwise, particularly for the Church, if, by the prevention of\r\nmarriage, the prospect existed of bringing land into the possession of\r\nthe Church by testamentary bequests. This, however, occurred only with\r\nthe lower ranks of freemen, whose condition, due to the circumstances\r\nalready mentioned, became ever more precarious, and who, listening to\r\nreligious suggestions and superstition, relinquished their property to\r\nthe Church in order to find protection and peace behind the walls of a\r\ncloister. Others, again, placed themselves under the protection of the\r\nChurch, in consideration of the payment of duties, and the rendering of\r\nservices. Frequently their descendants fell on this route a prey to the\r\nvery fate which their ancestors had sought to escape. They either\r\ngradually became Church dependents, or were turned into novices for the\r\ncloisters.\r\n\r\nThe towns, which, since the eleventh century were springing up, then had\r\nat that time a lively interest in promoting the increase of population;\r\nsettlement in them and marriage were made as easy as possible. The towns\r\nbecame especially asylums for countrymen, fleeing from unbearable\r\noppression, and for fugitive serfs and dependents. Later, however,\r\nmatters changed. So soon as the towns had acquired power, and contained\r\na well-organized body of the trades, hostility arose against new\r\nimmigrants, mostly propertyless peasants, who wanted to settle as\r\nhandicraftsmen. Inconvenient competitors were scented in these. The\r\nbarriers raised against immigration were multiplied. High settlement\r\nfees, expensive examinations, limitations of a trade to a certain number\r\nof masters and apprentices,--all this condemned thousands to pauperism,\r\nto a life of celibacy, and to vagabondage. When, in the course of the\r\nsixteenth century, and for reasons to be mentioned later, the\r\nflower-time of the towns was passing away, and their decline had set in,\r\nthe narrow horizon of the time caused the impediments to settlement and\r\nindependence to increase still more. Other circumstances also\r\ncontributed their demoralizing effect.\r\n\r\nThe tyranny of the landlords increased so mightily from decade to decade\r\nthat many of the vassals preferred to exchange their sorrowful life for\r\nthe trade of the tramp or the highwayman,--an occupation that was\r\ngreatly aided by the thick woods and the poor condition of the roads.\r\nOr, invited by the many violent disturbances of the time, they became\r\nsoldiers, who sold themselves where the price was highest, or the booty\r\nseemed most promising. An extensive male and female slum-proletariat\r\ncame into existence, and became a plague to the land. The Church\r\ncontributed faithfully to the general depravity. Already, in the\r\ncelibatic state of the priesthood there was a main-spring for the\r\nfostering of sexual excesses; these were still further promoted through\r\nthe continuous intercourse kept up with Italy and Rome.\r\n\r\nRome was not merely the capital of Christendom, as the residence of the\r\nPapacy. True to its antecedents during the heathen days of the Empire,\r\nRome had become the new Babel, the European High School of immorality;\r\nand the Papal court was its principal seat. With its downfall, the Roman\r\nEmpire had bequeathed all its vices to Christian Europe. These vices\r\nwere particularly nursed in Italy, whence, materially aided by the\r\nintercourse of the priesthood with Rome, they crowded into Germany. The\r\nuncommonly large number of priests, to a great extent vigorous men,\r\nwhose sexual wants were intensified by a lazy and luxurious life, and\r\nwho, through compulsory celibacy, were left to illegitimate or unnatural\r\nmeans of gratification, carried immorality into all circles of society.\r\nThis priesthood became a sort of pest-like danger to the morals of the\r\nfemale sex in the towns and villages. Monasteries and nunneries--and\r\ntheir number was legion--were not infrequently distinguishable from\r\npublic houses only in that the life led in them was more unbridled and\r\nlascivious, and in that numerous crimes, especially infanticide, could\r\nbe more easily concealed, seeing that in the cloisters only they\r\nexercised the administration of justice who led in the wrong-doing.\r\nOften did peasants seek to safeguard wife and daughter from priestly\r\nseduction by accepting none as a spiritual shepherd who did not bind\r\nhimself to keep a concubine;--a circumstance that led a Bishop of\r\nConstance to impose a \"concubine tax\" upon the priests of his diocese.\r\nSuch a condition of things explains the historically attested fact, that\r\nduring the Middle Ages--pictured to us by silly romanticists as so pious\r\nand moral--not less than 1500 strolling women turned up in 1414, at the\r\nCouncil of Constance.\r\n\r\nBut these conditions came in by no means with the decline of the Middle\r\nAges. They began early, and gave continuous occasion for complaints and\r\ndecrees. In 802 Charles the Great issued one of these, which ran this\r\nwise: \"The cloisters of nuns shall be strictly watched; the nuns may not\r\nroam about; they shall be kept with great diligence; neither shall they\r\nlive in strife and quarrel with one another; they shall in no wise be\r\ndisobedient to their Superiors or Abbesses, or cross the will of these.\r\nWherever they are placed under the rules of a cloister they are to\r\nobserve them throughout. Not whoring, not drunkenness, not covetousness\r\nshall they be the ministrants of, but in all ways lead just and sober\r\nlives. Neither shall any man enter their cloisters, except to attend\r\nmass, and he shall immediately depart.\" A regulation of the year 869\r\nprovided: \"If priests keep several women, or shed the blood of\r\nChristians or heathens, or break the canonical law, they shall be\r\ndeprived of their priesthood, because they are worse than laymen.\" The\r\nfact that the possession of several women was forbidden in those days\r\nonly to the priests, indicates that marriage with several wives was no\r\nrare occurrence in the ninth century. In fact, there were no laws\r\nforbidding it.\r\n\r\nAye, and even later, at the time of the Minnesaenger, during the twelfth\r\nand thirteenth centuries, the possession of several wives was considered\r\nin order.[42]\r\n\r\nThe position of woman was aggravated still more by the circumstance\r\nthat, along with all the impediments which gradually made marriage and\r\nsettlement harder, their number materially exceeded that of the men. As\r\nspecial reasons herefor are to be considered the numerous wars and\r\nfeuds, together with the perilousness of commercial voyages of those\r\ndays. Furthermore, mortality among men was higher, as the result of\r\nhabitual excesses and drunkenness. The predisposition to sickness and\r\ndeath that flowed from such habits of life, manifested itself strongly\r\nin the numerous pest-like diseases that raged during the Middle Ages. In\r\nthe interval between 1326 to 1400, there were thirty-two; from 1400 to\r\n1500, forty-one; and from 1500 to 1600, thirty years of pestilence.[43]\r\n\r\nSwarms of women roamed along the highways as jugglers, singers and\r\nplayers in the company of strolling students and clericals; they flooded\r\nthe fairs and markets; they were to be found wherever large crowds\r\ngathered, or festivals were celebrated. In the regiments of\r\nfoot-soldiers they constituted separate divisions, with their own\r\nsergeants. There, and quite in keeping with the guild character of the\r\nage, they were assigned to different duties, according to looks and age;\r\nand, under severe penalties, were not allowed to prostitute themselves\r\nto any man outside of their own branch. In the camps, they had to fetch\r\nhay, straw and wood; fill up trenches and ponds; and attend to the\r\ncleaning of the place along with the baggage lads. In sieges, they had\r\nto fill up the ditches with brushwood, lumber and faggots in order to\r\nhelp the storming of the place. They assisted in placing the field\r\npieces in position; and when these stuck in the bottomless roads, they\r\nhad to give a hand in pulling them out again.[44]\r\n\r\nIn order to counteract somewhat the misery of this crowd of helpless\r\nwomen, so-called \"Bettinen houses\" were instituted in many cities, and\r\nplaced under municipal supervision. Sheltered in these establishments,\r\nthe women were held to the observance of a decent life. But neither\r\nthese establishments, nor the numerous nunneries, were able to receive\r\nall that applied for succor.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties in the way of marriage; the tours undertaken by\r\nPrinces, and by temporal and spiritual magnates, who with their retinues\r\nof knights and bondmen, visited the cities; even the male youth of the\r\ncities themselves, the married men not excluded, who, buoyant with life\r\nand unaffected by scruples, sought change in pleasures;--all this\r\nproduced as early as in the Middle Ages the demand for prostitution. As\r\nevery trade was in those days organized and regulated, and could not\r\nexist without a guild, it so was with prostitution also. In all large\r\ncities there were \"houses of women\"--municipal, prince or Church\r\nregalities--the net profits of which flowed into the corresponding\r\ntreasuries. The women in these houses had a \"head-mistress,\" elected by\r\nthemselves, who was to keep discipline and order, and whose special\r\nduty it was to diligently watch that non-guild competitors, the\r\n\"interlopers,\" did not injure the legitimate trade. When caught, these\r\nwere condignly punished. The inmates of one of these houses for women,\r\nlocated in Nuerenberg, complained with the Magistrate, that \"other\r\ninn-keepers also kept women, who walked the streets at night, and took\r\nin married and other men, and that these plied (the trade) to such an\r\nextent, and so much more brazenly, than they did themselves in the\r\nmunicipal (guild) girls-house, that it was a pity and a shame to see\r\nsuch things happen in this worthy city.\"[45] These \"houses for women\"\r\nenjoyed special protection; disturbances of the peace in their\r\nneighborhood were fined twice as heavily. The female guild members also\r\nhad the right to take their place in the processions and festivals, at\r\nwhich, as is known, the guilds always assisted. Not infrequently were\r\nthey also drawn in as guests at the tables of Princes and Municipal\r\nCouncilmen. The \"houses of women\" were considered serviceable for the\r\n\"protection of marriage and of the honor of the maidens,\"--the identical\r\nreasoning with which State brothels were justified in Athens, and even\r\nto-day prostitution is excused. All the same, there were not wanting\r\nviolent persecutions of the _filles de joie_, proceeding from the\r\nidentical male circles who supported them with their custom and their\r\nmoney. The Emperor Charlemagne decreed that prostitutes shall be dragged\r\nnaked to the market place and there whipped; and yet, he himself, \"the\r\nMost Christian King and Emperor,\" had not less than six wives at a time;\r\nand neither were his daughters, who followed their father's example, by\r\nany means paragons of virtue. They prepared for him in the course of\r\ntheir lives many an unpleasant hour, and brought him home several\r\nillegitimate children. Alkuin, the friend and adviser of Charlemagne,\r\nwarned his pupils against \"the crowned doves, who flew at night over the\r\npalatinate,\" and he meant thereby the daughters of the Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe identical communities, that officially organized the brothel system,\r\nthat took it under their protection, and that granted all manner of\r\nprivileges to the \"priestesses of Venus,\" had the hardest and most cruel\r\npunishment in reserve for the poor and forsaken Magdalen. The female\r\ninfanticide, who, driven by desperation, killed the fruit of her womb,\r\nwas, as a rule, sentenced to suffer the most cruel death penalty; nobody\r\nbothered about the unconscionable seducer himself. Perchance he even sat\r\non the Judge's bench, which decreed the sentence of death upon the poor\r\nvictim. The same happens to-day.[46] Likewise was adultery by the wife\r\npunished most severely; she was certain of the pillory, at least; but\r\nover the adultery of the husband the mantle of Christian charity was\r\nthrown.\r\n\r\nIn Wuerzburg, during the Middle Ages, the keeper of women swore before\r\nthe Magistrate: \"To be true and good to the city, and to procure women.\"\r\nSimilarly in Nuerenberg, Ulm, Leipsic, Cologne, Frankfurt and elsewhere.\r\nIn Ulm, where the \"houses of women\" were abolished in 1537, the guilds\r\nmoved in 1551 that they be restored \"in order to avoid worse disorders.\"\r\nDistinguished foreigners were provided with _filles de joie_ at the\r\nexpense of the city. When King Ladislaus entered Vienna in 1452, the\r\nMagistrate sent to meet him a deputation of public girls, who, clad only\r\nin light gauze, revealed the handsomest shapes. At his entry into\r\nBrugges, the Emperor Charles V was likewise greeted by a deputation of\r\nnaked girls. Such occurrences met not with objection in those days.\r\n\r\nImaginative romancers, together with calculating people, have endeavored\r\nto represent the Middle Ages as particularly \"moral,\" and animated with\r\na veritable worship for woman. The period of the Minnesangers--from the\r\ntwelfth to the fourteenth century--contributed in giving a color to the\r\npretence. The knightly \"Minnedienst\" (service of love) which the French,\r\nItalian and German knights first became acquainted with among the\r\nMoriscos of Spain, is cited as evidence concerning the high degree of\r\nrespect in which woman was held at that time. But there are several\r\nthings to be kept in mind. In the first place, the knights constituted\r\nbut a trifling percentage of the population, and, proportionately, the\r\nknights' women of the women in general; in the second place, only a very\r\nsmall portion of the knights exercised the so-called \"Minnedienst;\"\r\nthirdly, the true nature of this service is grossly misunderstood, or\r\nhas been intentionally misrepresented. The age in which the\r\n\"Minnedienst\" flourished was at the same time the age of the grossest\r\nright-of-the-fist in Germany,--an age when all bonds of order were\r\ndissolved; and the knights indulged themselves without restraint in\r\nwaylaying of travelers, robbery and incendiarism. Such days of brutal\r\nforce are not the days in which mild and poetic sentiments are likely to\r\nprevail to any perceptible extent. The contrary is true. This period\r\ncontributed to destroy whatever regard possibly existed for the female\r\nsex. The knights, both of country and town, consisted mainly of rough,\r\ndissolute fellows, whose principal passion, besides feuds and guzzling,\r\nwas the unbridled gratification of sexual cravings. The chronicles of\r\nthe time do not tire of telling about the deeds of rapine and violence,\r\nthat the nobility was guilty of, particularly in the country, but in the\r\ncities also, where, appearing in patrician _role_, the nobility held in\r\nits hands the city regiment, down to the thirteenth, and partly even in\r\nthe fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Nor did the wronged have any\r\nmeans of redress; in the city, the squires (yunker) controlled the\r\njudges' bench; in the country, the landlord, invested with criminal\r\njurisdiction, was the knight, the Abbot or the Bishop. Accordingly, it\r\nis a violent exaggeration that, amid such morals and customs, the\r\nnobility and rulers had a particular respect for their wives and\r\ndaughters, and carried them on their hands as a sort of higher beings,\r\nlet alone that they cultivated such respect for the wives and daughters\r\nof the townsmen and peasants, for whom both the temporal and the\r\nspiritual masters entertained and proclaimed contempt only.\r\n\r\nA very small minority of knights consisted of sincere worshippers of\r\nfemale beauty, but their worship was by no means Platonic; it pursued\r\nquite material ends. And these material ends were pursued by those also\r\nwith whom Christian mysticism, coupled with natural sensuousness, made a\r\nunique combination. Even that harlequin among the worshippers of \"lovely\r\nwomen,\" Ulrich von Lichtenstein, of laughable memory, remained Platonic\r\nonly so long as he had to. At bottom the \"Minnedienst\" was the\r\napotheosis of the best beloved--at the expense of the own wife; _a sort\r\nof hetairism, carried over into Middle Age Christianity_, as it existed\r\nin Greece at the time of Pericles. In point of fact, during the Middle\r\nAges, the mutual seduction of one another's wives was a \"Minnedienst\"\r\nstrongly in vogue among the knights, just the same as, in certain\r\ncircles of our own bourgeoisie, similar performances are now repeated.\r\nThat much for the romanticism of the Middle Ages and their regard for\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that, in the open recognition of the pleasures of\r\nthe senses, there lay in that age the acknowledgment that the natural\r\nimpulses, implanted in every healthy and ripe human being, are entitled\r\nto be satisfied. In so far there lay in the demonstration a victory of\r\nvigorous nature over the asceticism of Christianity. On the other hand,\r\nit must be noted that the recognition and satisfaction fell to the share\r\nof only one sex, while the other sex, on the contrary, was treated as if\r\nit could not and should not have the same impulses; the slightest\r\ntransgression of the laws of morality prescribed by man, was severely\r\npunished. The narrow and limited horizon, within which moved the citizen\r\nof the Middle Ages, caused him to adopt narrow and limited measures also\r\nwith respect to the position of woman. And, as a consequence of\r\ncontinued oppression and peculiar education, woman herself has so\r\ncompletely adapted herself to her master's habits and system of thought,\r\nthat she finds her condition natural and proper.\r\n\r\nDo we not know that there have been millions of slaves who found\r\nslavery natural, and never would have freed themselves, had their\r\nliberators not risen from the midst of the class of the slave-holders?\r\nDid not Prussian peasants, when, as a result of the Stein laws, they\r\nwere to be freed from serfdom, petition to be left as they were,\r\n\"because who was to take care of them when they fell sick?\" And is it\r\nnot similarly with the modern Labor Movement? How many workingmen do not\r\nallow themselves to be influenced and led without a will of their own?\r\n\r\nThe oppressed needs the stimulator and firer, because he lacks the\r\nindependence and faculty for initiative. It was so with the modern\r\nproletarian movement; it is so also in the struggle for the emancipation\r\nof woman, which is intimately connected with that of the proletariat.\r\nEven in the instance of the comparatively favorably situated bourgeois\r\nof old, noble and clerical advocates broke the way open for him to\r\nconduct his battle for freedom.\r\n\r\nHowever numerous the shortcomings of the Middle Ages, there was then a\r\nhealthy sensualism, that sprang from a rugged and happy native\r\ndisposition among the people, and that Christianity was unable to\r\nsuppress. The hypocritical prudery and bashfulness; the secret\r\nlustfulness, prevalent to-day, that hesitates and balks at calling\r\nthings by their right name, and to speak about natural things in a\r\nnatural way;--all that was foreign to the Middle Ages. Neither was that\r\nage familiar with the piquant double sense, in which, out of defective\r\nnaturalness and out of a prudery that has become morality, things that\r\nmay not be clearly uttered, are veiled, and are thereby rendered all the\r\nmore harmful; such a language incites but does not satisfy; it suggests\r\nbut does not speak out. Our social conversation, our novels and our\r\ntheatres are full of these piquant equivoques,--and their effect is\r\nvisible. This spiritualism, which is not the spiritualism of the\r\ntranscendental philosopher, but that of the _roue_, and that hides\r\nitself behind the spiritualism of religion, has great power to-day.\r\n\r\nThe healthy sensualism of the Middle Ages found in Luther its classic\r\ninterpreter. We have here to do, not so much with the religious\r\nreformer, as with Luther the man. On the human side, Luther's robust\r\nprimeval nature stepped forward unadulterated; it compelled him to\r\nexpress his appetite for love and enjoyment forcibly and without\r\nreserve. His position, as former Roman Catholic clergyman, had opened\r\nhis eyes. By personal practice, so to speak, had he learned the\r\nunnaturalness of the life led by the monks and nuns. Hence the warmth\r\nwith which he warred against clerical and monastic celibacy. His words\r\nhold good to this day, for all those who believe they may sin against\r\nnature, and imagine they can reconcile with their conceptions of\r\nmorality and propriety, governmental and social institutions that\r\nprevent millions from fulfilling their natural mission. Luther says:\r\n\"Woman, except as high and rare grace, can dispense with man as little\r\nas she can with food, sleep, water and other natural wants. Conversely,\r\nalso, neither can man dispense with woman. The reason is this: It is as\r\ndeeply implanted in nature to beget children as to eat and drink.\r\nTherefore did God furnish the body with members, veins, discharges and\r\nall that is needed therefor. He who will resist this, and prevent its\r\ngoing as Nature wills, what else does he but endeavor to resist Nature's\r\nbeing Nature, that fire burn, water wet, that man eat, drink or sleep?\"\r\nAnd in his sermon on married life he says: \"As little as it is in my\r\npower that I be not a man, just so little is it in your power to be\r\nwithout a man. For it is not a matter of free will or deliberation, but\r\na necessary, natural matter that all that is male must have a wife, and\r\nwhat is female must have a husband.\" Luther did not speak in this\r\nenergetic manner in behalf of married life and the necessity of sexual\r\nintercourse only; he also turns against the idea that marriage and\r\nChurch have anything in common. In this he stood squarely on the ground\r\nof the olden days, which considered marriage an act of free will on the\r\npart of those who engaged in it, and that did not concern the Church. On\r\nthis head he said: \"Know, therefore, that marriage is an outside affair,\r\nas any other earthly act. The same as I am free to eat, drink, sleep,\r\nwalk, ride, deal, speak and trade with a heathen, a Jew, a Turk or a\r\nheretic, _likewise am I free to enter into and remain in wedlock with\r\none of them. Turn your back upon the fool laws that forbid such a\r\nthing_.... A heathen is a man and woman, created by God in perfect form,\r\nas well as St. Peter and St. Paul and St. Luke; be then silent for a\r\nloose and false Christian that you are.\" Luther, like other Reformers,\r\npronounced himself against all limitation of marriage, and he was for\r\nalso allowing the re-union of divorced couples, against which the Church\r\nwas up in arms. He said: \"As to the manner in which marriage and divorce\r\nare to be conducted among us, I claim that it should be made the\r\nbusiness of the jurists, and placed under the jurisdiction of earthly\r\nconcerns, because marriage is but an earthly and outside matter.\" It was\r\nin keeping with this view that, not until the close of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, was marriage by the Church made obligatory under Protestantism.\r\nUntil then so-called \"conscience marriage\" held good, i. e., the simple\r\nmutual obligation to consider each other man and wife, and to mean to\r\nlive in wedlock. Such a marriage was considered by German law to be\r\nlegally entered into. Luther even went so far that he conceded to the\r\nunsatisfied party--even if that be the woman--the right to seek\r\nsatisfaction outside of the marriage bonds \"in order to satisfy nature,\r\nwhich cannot be crossed.\"[47] This conception of marriage is the same\r\nthat prevailed in antiquity, and that came up later during the French\r\nRevolution. Luther here set up maxims that will arouse the strongest\r\nindignation of a large portion of our \"respectable men and women,\" who,\r\nin their religious zeal, are so fond of appealing to him. In his\r\ntreatise \"On Married Life,\"[48] he says: \"If an impotent man falls to\r\nthe lot of a hearty woman, and she still cannot openly take another, and\r\ndoes not wish to marry again, she shall say unto her husband: 'Lo, dear\r\nhusband, thou shalt not be wronged by me. Thou hast deceived me and my\r\nyoung body, and hast therefore brought my honor and salvation into\r\ndanger. There is no glory to God between us two. Grant me to cohabit\r\nsecretly with thy brother or nearest friend, and thou shalt have the\r\nname, _so that thy property come not to strange heirs; and allow thyself\r\nto be, in turn, willingly deceived by me, as thou did deceive me without\r\nthy will_.\" The husband, Luther goes on to show, is in duty bound to\r\ngrant the request. \"If he declines, then has she the right to run away\r\nfrom him to another, and to woo elsewhere. Conversely, if a woman\r\ndeclines to exercise the conjugal duty, her husband has the right to\r\ncohabit with another, only he should tell her so beforehand.\"[49] It\r\nwill be seen that these are wonderfully radical, and, in the eyes of our\r\ndays, so rich in hypocritical prudery, even downright \"immoral\" views,\r\nthat the great Reformer develops. Luther, however, expressed only that\r\nwhich, at the time, was the popular view.[50]\r\n\r\nThe passages quoted from the writings and addresses of Luther on\r\nmarriage, are of special importance for the reason that these views are\r\nin strong contradiction with those that prevail to-day in the Church. In\r\nthe struggle that it latterly has had to conduct with the clerical\r\nfraternity, the Social Democracy can appeal with full right to Luther,\r\nwho takes on the question of marriage a stand free from all prejudice.\r\n\r\nLuther and all the Reformers went even further in the marriage question,\r\ntrue enough, only for opportunist reasons, and out of complaisance\r\ntowards the Princes whose strong support and permanent friendship they\r\nsought to secure and keep to the Reformation. The friendly Duke of\r\nHessen, Philip I, had, besides his legitimate wife, a sweetheart,\r\nwilling to yield to his wishes, but only under the condition that he\r\nmarry her. It was a thorny problem. A divorce from the wife, in the\r\nabsence of convincing reasons, would give great scandal; on the other\r\nhand, a marriage with two women at a time was an unheard of thing with a\r\nChristian Prince of modern days; it would give rise to no less a\r\nscandal. All this notwithstanding, Philip, in his passion, decided in\r\nfavor of the latter step. The point was now to establish that the act\r\ndid no violence to the Bible, and to secure the approval of the\r\nReformers, especially of Luther and Melanchthon. The negotiations, set\r\non foot by the Duke, began first with Butzer, who declared himself in\r\nfavor of the plan, and promised to win over Luther and Melanchthon.\r\nButzer justified his opinion with the argument: To possess several wives\r\nat once was not against the evangelium. St. Paul, who said much upon the\r\nsubject of who was not to inherit the kingdom of God, made no mention of\r\nthose who had two wives. St. Paul, on the contrary, said \"that a Bishop\r\nwas to have but one wife, the same with his servants; hence, if it had\r\nbeen compulsory that every man have but one wife he would have so\r\nordered, and forbidden a plurality of wives.\" Luther and Melanchthon\r\njoined this reasoning, and gave their assent to double marriages, after\r\nthe Duke's wife herself had consented to the marriage with the second\r\nwife under the condition \"that he was to fulfil his marital duties\r\ntowards her more than ever before.\"[51] The question of the\r\njustification of bigamy had before then--at the time when the issue was\r\nthe consenting to the double marriage of Henry VIII of England--caused\r\nmany a headache to Luther, as appears from a letter to the Chancellor of\r\nSaxony, Brink, dated January, 1524. Luther wrote to him that, _in point\r\nof principle, he could not reject bigamy_ because it ran not counter to\r\nHoly Writ;[52] but that he held it scandalous when the same happened\r\namong Christians, \"who should leave alone even things that are\r\npermissible.\" After the wedding of the Duke, which actually took place\r\nin March, 1540, and in answer to a letter of acknowledgment from him,\r\nLuther wrote (April 10): \"That your Grace is happy on the score of our\r\nopinion, _which we fain would see kept secret; else, even the rude\r\npeasants_ (in imitation of the Duke's example) might finally produce as\r\nstrong, if not stronger, reasons, whereby we might then have much\r\ntrouble on our hands.\"\r\n\r\nUpon Melanchthon, the consent to the double marriage of the Duke must\r\nhave been less hard. Before that, he had written to Henry VIII \"every\r\nPrince has the right to introduce polygamy in his domains.\" But the\r\ndouble marriage of the Duke made such a great and unpleasant sensation,\r\nthat, in 1541, he circulated a treatise in which polygamy is defended as\r\nno transgression against Holy Writ.[53] People were not then living in\r\nthe ninth or twelfth century, when polygamy was tolerated without\r\nshocking society. Social conditions had very materially changed in the\r\nmeantime; in a great measure the mark had had to yield to the power of\r\nthe nobility and the clergy; it had even extensively disappeared, and\r\nwas further uprooted after the unhappy issue of the Peasant Wars.\r\nPrivate property had become the general foundation of society. Beside\r\nthe rural population, that cultivated the soil, a strong, self-conscious\r\nhandicraft element had arisen, and was dominated by the interests of its\r\nown station. Commerce had assumed large dimensions, and had produced a\r\nmerchant class, which, what with the splendor of its outward position\r\nand its wealth, awoke the envy and hostility of a nobility that was\r\nsinking ever deeper into poverty and licentiousness. The burghers'\r\nsystem of private property had triumphed everywhere, as was evidenced by\r\nthe then universal introduction of the Roman law; the contrasts between\r\nthe classes were palpable, and everywhere did they bump against one\r\nanother. Monogamy became, under such conditions, the natural basis for\r\nthe sexual relations; a step such as taken by the Duke of Hessen now did\r\nviolence to the ruling morals and customs, which, after all, are but the\r\nform of expression of the economic conditions that happen at the time to\r\nprevail. On the other hand, society came to terms with prostitution, as\r\na necessary accompaniment of monogamy, and an institution supplemental\r\nthereto;--and tolerated it.\r\n\r\nIn recognizing the gratification of the sexual impulses as a law of\r\nNature, Luther but uttered what the whole male population thought, and\r\nopenly claimed for itself. He, however, also contributed--through the\r\nReformation, which carried through the abolition of celibacy among the\r\nclergy, and the removal of the cloisters from Protestant\r\nterritories--that to hundreds of thousands the opportunity was offered\r\nto do justice to nature's impulses under legitimate forms. True\r\nagain,--due to the existing order of property, and to the legislation\r\nthat flowed therefrom,--hundreds of thousands of others continued to\r\nremain excluded. The Reformation was the first protest of the\r\nlarge-propertied bourgeois or capitalist class, then rising into being,\r\nagainst the restrictions imposed by feudalism in Church, State and\r\nsociety. It strove after freedom from the narrow bonds of the guild, the\r\ncourt and the judiciary; it strove after the centralization of the\r\nState, after the abolition of the numerous seats of idlers, the\r\nmonasteries; and it demanded their use for practical production. The\r\nmovement aimed at the abolition of the feudal form of property and\r\nproduction; it aimed at placing in its stead the free property of the\r\ncapitalist, i. e., in the stead of the existing system of mutual\r\nprotection in small and disconnected circles, there was to be unchained\r\nthe free individual struggle of individual efforts in the competition\r\nfor property.\r\n\r\nOn the religious field, Luther was the representative of these bourgeois\r\naspirations. When he took a stand for the freedom of marriage, the\r\nquestion could not be simply about civic marriage, which was realized in\r\nGermany only in our own age through the civil laws and the legislation\r\ntherewith connected,--freedom to move, freedom of pursuit, and freedom\r\nof domicile. In how far the position of woman was thereby improved will\r\nbe shown later. Meanwhile things had not matured so far at the time of\r\nthe Reformation. If, through the regulations of the Reformation many\r\nwere afforded the possibility to marry, the severe persecutions that\r\nfollowed later hampered the freedom of sexual intercourse. The Roman\r\nCatholic clergy having in its time displayed a certain degree of\r\ntolerance, and even laxity, towards sexual excesses, now the Protestant\r\nclergy, once itself was provided for, raged all the more violently\r\nagainst the practice. War was declared upon the public \"houses of\r\nwomen;\" they were closed as \"Holes of Satan;\" the prostitutes were\r\npersecuted as \"daughters of the devil;\" and every woman who slipped was\r\nplaced on the pillory as a specimen of all sinfulness.\r\n\r\nOut of the once hearty small property-holding bourgeois of the Middle\r\nAges, who lived and let live, now became a bigoted, straight-laced,\r\ndark-browed maw-worm, who \"saved-up,\" to the end that his large\r\nproperty-holding bourgeois successor might live all the more lustily in\r\nthe nineteenth century, and might be able to dissipate all the more. The\r\nrespectable citizen, with his stiff necktie, his narrow horizon and his\r\nsevere code of morals, was the prototype of society. The legitimate\r\nwife, who had not been particularly edified by the sensuality of the\r\nMiddle Ages, tolerated in Roman Catholic days, was quite at one with the\r\nPuritanical spirit of Protestantism. But other circumstances supervened,\r\nthat, affecting, as they did, unfavorably the general condition of\r\nthings in Germany, joined in exercising in general an unfavorable\r\ninfluence upon the position of woman.\r\n\r\nThe revolution--effected in production, money and trade, particularly as\r\nregarded Germany,--due to the discovery of America and the sea-route to\r\nthe East Indies, produced, first of all, a great reaction on the social\r\ndomain. Germany ceased to be the center of European traffic and\r\ncommerce. Spain, Portugal, Holland, England, took successively the\r\nleadership, the latter keeping it until our own days. German industry\r\nand German commerce began to decline. At the same time, the religious\r\nReformation had destroyed the political unity of the nation. The\r\nReformation became the cloak under which the German principalities\r\nsought to emancipate themselves from the Imperial power. In their turn,\r\nthe Princes brought the power of the nobility under their own control,\r\nand, in order to reach this end all the more easily, favored the cities,\r\nnot a few of which, in sight of the ever more troubled times, placed\r\nthemselves, of their own free will, under the rule of the Princes. The\r\nfinal effect was that the bourgeois or capitalist class, alarmed at the\r\nfinancial decline of its trade, raised ever higher barriers to protect\r\nitself against unpleasant competition. The ossification of conditions\r\ngained ground; and with it the impoverishment of the masses.\r\n\r\nLater, the Reformation had for a consequence the calling forth of the\r\nreligious wars and persecutions--always, of course, as cloaks for the\r\npolitical and economic purposes of the Princes--that, with short\r\ninterruptions, raged throughout Germany for over a century, and ended\r\nwith the country's complete exhaustion, at the close of the Thirty\r\nYears' War in 1648. Germany had become an immense field of corpses and\r\nruins; whole territories and provinces lay waste; hundreds of cities,\r\nthousands of villages had been partially or wholly burnt down; many of\r\nthem have since disappeared forever from the face of the earth. In other\r\nplaces the population had sunk to a third, a fourth, a fifth, even to an\r\neighth and tenth part. Such was the case, for instance, with cities like\r\nNeurenberg, and with the whole of Franconia. And now, at the hour of\r\nextreme need, and with the end in view of providing the depopulated\r\ncities and villages as quickly as possible with an increased number of\r\npeople, the drastic measure was resorted to of \"raising the law,\" and\r\n_allowing a man two wives_. The wars had carried off the men; of women\r\nthere was an excess. On February 14, 1650, the Congress of Franconia,\r\nheld in Nuerenberg, adopted the resolution that \"men under sixty years\r\nof age shall not be admitted to the monasteries;\" furthermore, it\r\nordered \"the priests and curates, if not ordained, and the canons of\r\nreligious establishments, shall marry;\" \"moreover every male shall be\r\nallowed to marry two wives; and all and each males are earnestly\r\nreminded, and shall be often warned, _from the pulpit_ also, to so\r\ncomport themselves in this matter; and care shall be taken that he shall\r\nfully and with becoming discretion diligently endeavor, so that, as a\r\nmarried man, to whom is granted that he take two wives, he not only take\r\nproper care of both wives, but avoid all misunderstanding among them.\"\r\nAt that time, we see, matters that are to-day kept under strictest\r\nsecrecy, were often discussed as of course from the pulpit itself.\r\n\r\nBut not commerce alone was at a standstill. Traffic and industry had\r\nbeen extensively ruined during this protracted period; they could\r\nrecover only by little and little. A large part of the population had\r\nbecome wild and demoralized, disused to all orderly occupations. During\r\nthe wars, it was the robbing, plundering, despoiling and murdering\r\narmies of mercenaries, which crossed Germany from one end to the other,\r\nthat burned and knocked down friend and foe alike; after the wars, it\r\nwas countless robbers, beggars and swarms of vagabonds that threw the\r\npopulation into fear and terror, and impeded and destroyed commerce and\r\ntraffic. For the female sex, in particular, a period of deep suffering\r\nhad broken. Contempt for woman had made great progress during the times\r\nof license. The general lack of work weighed heaviest on their\r\nshoulders; by the thousands did these women, like the male vagabonds,\r\ninfest the roads and woods, and filled the poorhouses and prisons of the\r\nPrinces and the cities. On top of all these sufferings came the forcible\r\nejectment of numerous peasant families by a land-hungry nobility.\r\n\r\nCompelled, since the Reformation, ever more to bend before the might of\r\nthe Princes, and rendered ever more dependent upon these through court\r\noffices and military posts, the nobility now sought to recoup itself\r\ndouble and threefold with the robbery of peasant estates for the injury\r\nit had sustained at the hand of the Princes. The Reformation offered the\r\nPrinces the desired pretext to appropriate the rich Church estates,\r\nwhich they swallowed in innumerable acres of land. The Elector August of\r\nSaxony, for instance, had turned not less than three hundred clergy\r\nestates from their original purpose, up to the close of the sixteenth\r\ncentury.[54] Similarly did his brothers and cousins, the other\r\nProtestant Princes, and, above all, the Princes of Brandenburg. The\r\nnobility only imitated the example by bagging peasant estates, that had\r\nlost their owners, by ejecting free as well as serf peasants from house\r\nand home, and enriching themselves with the goods of these. To this\r\nparticular end, the miscarried peasant revolts of the sixteenth century\r\nfurnished the best pretext. After the first attempts had succeeded,\r\nnever after were reasons wanting to proceed further in equally violent\r\nstyle. With the aid of all manner of chicaneries, vexations and\r\ntwistings of the law--whereto the in-the-meantime naturalized Roman law\r\nlent a convenient handle--the peasants were bought out at the lowest\r\nprices, or they were driven from their property in order to round up the\r\nestates of noblemen. Whole villages, the peasant homes of as much as\r\nhalf a province, were in this way wiped out. Thus--so as to give a few\r\nillustrations--out of 12,543 peasant homestead appanages of knightly\r\nhouses, which Mecklenburg still possessed at the time of the Thirty\r\nYears' War, there were, in 1848, only 1,213 left. In Pommerania, since\r\n1628, not less than 12,000 peasant homesteads disappeared. The change in\r\npeasant economy, that took place in the course of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, was a further incentive for the expropriation of the peasant\r\nhomesteads, especially to turn the last rests of the commons into the\r\nproperty of the nobility. The system of rotation of crops was\r\nintroduced. It provided for a rotation in cultivation within given\r\nspaces of time. Corn lands were periodically turned into meadows. This\r\nfavored the raising of cattle, and made possible the reduction of the\r\nnumber of farm-hands. The crowd of beggars and tramps grew ever larger,\r\nand thus one decree followed close upon the heels of another to reduce,\r\nby the application of the severest punishments, the number of beggars\r\nand vagabonds.\r\n\r\nIn the cities matters lay no better than in the country districts.\r\nBefore then, women were active in very many trades in the capacity of\r\nworking women as well as of employers. There were, for instance, female\r\nfurriers in Frankfurt and in the cities of Sleswig; bakers, in the\r\ncities of the middle Rhine; embroiderers of coats of arms and\r\nbeltmakers, in Cologne and Strassburg; strap-cutters, in Bremen;\r\nclothing-cutters in Frankfurt; tanners in Nuerenberg; gold spinners and\r\nbeaters in Cologne.[55] Women were now crowded back. The abandonment of\r\nthe pompous Roman Catholic worship alone, due to the Protestantizing of\r\na large portion of Germany, either injured severely a number of trades,\r\nespecially the artistic ones, or destroyed them altogether; and it was\r\nin just these trades that many working women were occupied. As,\r\nmoreover, it ever happens when a social state of things is moving to its\r\ndownfall, the wrongest methods are resorted to, and the evil is thereby\r\naggravated. The sad economic condition of most of the German nations\r\ncaused the decimated population to appear as _overpopulation_, and\r\ncontributed greatly towards rendering a livelihood harder to earn, and\r\ntowards prohibitions of marriage.\r\n\r\nNot until the eighteenth century did a slow improvement of matters set\r\nin. The absolute Princes had the liveliest interest, with the view of\r\nraising the standard abroad of their rule, to increase the population of\r\ntheir territories. They needed this, partly in order to obtain soldiers\r\nfor their wars, partly also to gain taxpayers, who were to raise the\r\nsums needed either for the army, or for the extravagant indulgences of\r\nthe court, or for both. Following the example of Louis XIV of France,\r\nthe majority of the then extraordinarily numerous princely courts of\r\nGermany displayed great lavishness in all manner of show and tinsel.\r\nThis was especially the case in the matter of the keeping of\r\nmistresses, which stood in inverse ratio to the size and capabilities of\r\nthe realms and realmlets. The history of these courts during the\r\neighteenth century belongs to the ugliest chapters of history. Libraries\r\nare filled with the chronicles of the scandals of that era. One\r\npotentate sought to surpass the other in hollow pretentiousness, insane\r\nlavishness and expensive military fooleries. Above all, the most\r\nincredible was achieved in the way of female excesses. It is hard to\r\ndetermine which of the many German courts the palm should be assigned to\r\nfor extravagance and for a life that vitiated public morals. To-day it\r\nwas this, to-morrow that court; no German State escaped the plague. The\r\nnobility aped the Princes, and the citizens in the residence cities aped\r\nthe nobility. If the daughter of a citizen's family had the luck to\r\nplease a gentleman high at court, perchance the Serenissimus himself, in\r\nnineteen cases out of twenty she felt highly blessed by such favor, and\r\nher family was ready to hand her over for a mistress to the nobleman or\r\nthe Prince. The same was the case with most of the noble families if one\r\nof their daughters found favor with the Prince. Characterlessness and\r\nshamelessness ruled over wide circles. As bad as the worst stood matters\r\nin the two German capitals, Vienna and Berlin. In the Capua of Germany,\r\nVienna, true enough, the strict Maria Theresa reigned through a large\r\nportion of the century, but she was impotent against the doings of a\r\nrich nobility, steeped in sensuous pleasures, and of the citizen circles\r\nthat emulated the nobility. With the Chastity Commissions that she\r\nestablished, and in the aid of which an extensive spy-system was\r\norganized, she partly provoked bitterness, and partly made herself\r\nlaughable. The success was zero. In frivolous Vienna, sayings like these\r\nmade the rounds during the second half of the eighteenth century: \"You\r\nmust love your neighbor like yourself, that is to say, you must love\r\nyour neighbor's wife as much as your own;\" or \"If the wife goes to the\r\nright, the husband may go to the left: if she takes an attendant, he\r\ntakes a lady friend.\" In how frivolous a vein marriage and adultery were\r\nthen taken, transpires from a letter of the poet Ew. Chr. von Kleist,\r\naddressed in 1751 to his friend Gleim. Among other things he there says:\r\n\"You are already informed on the adventure of the Mark-Graf Heinrich. He\r\nsent his wife to his country seat and intends to divorce her because he\r\nfound the Prince of Holstein in bed with her.... The Mark-Graf might\r\nhave done better had he kept quiet about the affair, instead of now\r\ncausing half Berlin and all the world to talk about him. Moreover, _such\r\na natural thing should not be taken so ill_, all the more when, like the\r\nMark-Graf, one is not so waterproof himself. Mutual repulsion, we all\r\nknow, is unavoidable in married life: all husbands and wives are\r\nperforce unfaithful, due to _their illusions concerning other estimable\r\npersons. How can that be punished that one is forced to?_\" On Berlin\r\nconditions, the English Ambassador, Lord Malmsbury, wrote in 1772:\r\n\"Total corruption of morals pervades both sexes of all classes, whereto\r\nmust be added the indigence, caused, partly through the taxes imposed by\r\nthe present King, partly through the love of luxury that they took from\r\nhis grandfather. The men lead a life of excesses with limited means,\r\nwhile the women are harpies, wholly bereft of shame. They yield\r\nthemselves to him who pays best. Tenderness and true love are things\r\nunknown to them.\"[56]\r\n\r\nThings were at their worst in Berlin under Frederick II, who reigned\r\nfrom 1786 to 1796. He led with the worst example; and his court\r\nchaplain, Zoellner, even lowered himself to the point of marrying the\r\nKing to the latter's mistress, Julie von Boss, as a second wife, and as\r\nshe soon thereupon died in childbed, Zoellner again consented to marry\r\nthe King to the Duchess Sophie of Doenhoff as a second wife by the side\r\nof the Queen.\r\n\r\nMore soldiers and more taxpayers was the leading desire of the Princes.\r\nLouis XIV, after whose death France was entirely impoverished in money\r\nand men, set up pensions for parents who had ten children, and the\r\npension was raised when they reached twelve children. His General, the\r\nMarshal of Saxony, even made to him the proposition to _allow marriages\r\nonly for the term of five years_. Fifty years later, in 1741, Frederick\r\nthe Great wrote, \"I look upon men as a herd of deer in the zoological\r\ngarden of a great lord, their only duty is to populate and fill the\r\npark.\"[57]\r\n\r\nLater, he extensively depopulated his \"deer park\" with his wars, and\r\nthen took pains to \"populate\" it again with foreign immigration.\r\n\r\nThe German multiplicity of States, that was in fullest bloom in the\r\neighteenth century, presented a piebald map of the most different social\r\nconditions and legislative codes. While in the minority of the States\r\nefforts were made to improve the economic situation by promoting new\r\nindustries, by making settlement easier and by changing the marriage\r\nlaws in the direction of facilitating wedlock, the majority of the\r\nStates and statelets remained true to their backward views, and\r\nintensified the unfavorable conditions of marriage and settlement for\r\nboth men and women. Seeing, however, that human nature will not allow\r\nitself to be suppressed, all impediments and vexations notwithstanding,\r\nconcubinage sprang up in large quantity, and the number of illegitimate\r\nchildren was at no time as large as in these days when the \"paternal\r\nregiment\" of the absolute Princes reigned in \"Christian simplicity.\"\r\n\r\nThe married woman of citizen rank lived in strict seclusion. The number\r\nof her tasks and occupations was so large that, as a conscientious\r\nhousewife, she had to be at her post early and late in order to fulfil\r\nher duties, and even that was possible to her only with the aid of her\r\ndaughters. Not only were there to be filled those daily household duties\r\nwhich to-day, too, the small middle class housewife has to attend to,\r\nbut a number of others also, which the housewife of to-day is freed from\r\nthrough modern development. She had to spin, weave, bleach and sew the\r\nlinen and clothes, prepare soap and candles, brew beer,--in short, she\r\nwas the veriest Cinderella: her only recreation was Sunday's church.\r\nMarriage was contracted only within the same social circles; the\r\nstrongest and most ludicrous spirit of caste dominated all relations,\r\nand tolerated no transgression. The daughters were brought up in the\r\nsame spirit; they were held under strict home seclusion; their mental\r\neducation did not go beyond the bounds of the narrowest home relations.\r\nOn top of this, an empty and hollow formality, meant as a substitute for\r\neducation and culture, turned existence, that of woman in particular,\r\ninto a veritable treadmill. Thus the spirit of the Reformation\r\ndegenerated into the worst pedantry, that sought to smother the natural\r\ndesires of man, together with his pleasures in life under a confused\r\nmass of rules and usages that affected to be \"worthy,\" but that benumbed\r\nthe soul.\r\n\r\nGradually, however, an economic change took place, that first seized\r\nWestern Europe and then reached into Germany also. The discovery of\r\nAmerica, the doubling of the Cape of Good Hope, the opening of the sea\r\nroute of the East Indies, the further discoveries that hinged on these,\r\nand finally, the circumnavigation of the earth, revolutionized the life\r\nand views of the most advanced nations of Europe. The unthought-of rapid\r\nexpansion of the world's commerce, called to life through the opening of\r\never newer markets for European industry and products, revolutionized\r\nthe old system of handicraft. Manufacture arose, and thence flowed large\r\nproduction. Germany--so long held back in her material development by\r\nher religious wars and her political disintegration, which religious\r\ndifferences promoted,--was finally dragged into the stream of the\r\ngeneral progress. In several quarters, large production developed under\r\nthe form of manufacture: flax and wool-spinning and weaving, the\r\nmanufacture of cloth, mining, the manufacture of iron, glass and\r\nporcelain, transportation, etc. Fresh labor power, female included, came\r\ninto demand. But this newly rising form of industry met with the most\r\nviolent opposition on the part of the craftsmen, ossified in the guild\r\nand medieval corporation system, who furiously fought every change in\r\nthe method of production, and saw therein a mortal enemy. The French\r\nRevolution supervened. While casting aside the older order in France,\r\nthe Revolution also carried into Germany a fresh current of air, which\r\nthe old order could not for long resist. The French invasion hastened\r\nthe downfall,--this side of the Rhine also--of the old, worn-out\r\nsystem. Whatever attempt was made, during the period of re-action after\r\n1815, to turn back the wheels of time, the New had grown too strong, it\r\nfinally remained victorious.\r\n\r\nThe rise of machinery, the application of the natural sciences to the\r\nprocess of production, the new roads of commerce and traffic burst\r\nasunder the last vestiges of the old system. The guild privileges, the\r\npersonal restrictions, the mark and jurisdictional rights, together with\r\nall that thereby hung, walked into the lumber room. The strongly\r\nincreased need of labor-power did not rest content with the men, it\r\ndemanded woman also as a cheaper article. The conditions that had become\r\nuntenable, had to fall; and they fell. The time thereto,--long\r\nwished-for by the newly risen class, the bourgeoisie or capitalist\r\nclass--arrived the moment Germany gained her political unity. The\r\ncapitalist class demanded imperiously the unhampered development of all\r\nthe social forces; it demanded this for the benefit of its own\r\ncapitalist interests, that, at that time, and, to a certain degree, were\r\nalso the interests of the large majority. Thus came about the liberty of\r\ntrade, the liberty of emigration, the removal of the barriers to\r\nmarriage,--in short, that whole system of legislation that designates\r\nitself \"liberal.\" The old-time reactionists expected from these measures\r\nthe smash-up of morality. The late Adolph Ketteler of Mainz moaned,\r\nalready in 1865, accordingly, before the new social legislation had\r\nbecome general, \"that the tearing down of the existing barriers to\r\nmatrimony meant the dissolution of wedlock, it being now possible for\r\nthe married to run away from each other at will.\" A pretty admission\r\nthat the moral bonds of modern marriage are so weak, that only\r\n_compulsion_ can be relied on to hold the couple together.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance, on the one hand, that the now naturally more numerous\r\nmarriages effected a rapid increase of population, and, on the other,\r\nthat the gigantically developing industry of the new era brought on many\r\nills, never known of before, caused the spectre of \"overpopulation\" to\r\nrise anew. Conservative and liberal economists pull since then the same\r\nstring. We shall show what this fear of so-called overpopulation means;\r\nwe shall trace the feared phenomenon back to its legitimate source.\r\nAmong those who suffer of the overpopulation fear, and who demand the\r\nrestriction of freedom to marry, especially for workingmen, belong\r\nparticularly Prof. Ad. Wagner. According to him, workingmen marry too\r\nearly, in comparison with the middle class. He, along with others of\r\nthis opinion, forget that the male members of the higher class, marry\r\nlater only in order to wed \"according to their station in life,\" a thing\r\nthey can not do before they have obtained a certain position. For this\r\nabstinence, the males of the higher classes indemnify themselves with\r\nprostitution. Accordingly, it is to prostitution that the working class\r\nare referred, the moment marriage is made difficult for, or, under\r\ncertain circumstances, is wholly forbidden to, them. But, then, let\r\nnone wonder at the results, and let him not raise an outcry at the\r\n\"decline of morality,\" if the women also, who have the same desires as\r\nthe men, seek to satisfy in illegitimate relations the promptings of the\r\nstrongest impulse of nature. Moreover, the views of Wagner are at\r\nfisticuffs with the interests of the capitalist class, which, oddly\r\nenough, shares his views: it needs many \"hands,\" so as to own cheap\r\nlabor-power that may fit it out for competition in the world's market.\r\nWith such petty notions and measures, born of a near-sighted\r\nphilistinism, the gigantic growing ills of the day are not to be healed.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[22] Tarnowsky. \"Die krankhaften Erscheinungen des Geschlechtsinnes.\"\r\nBerlin, August Hirschwald.\r\n\r\n[23] Tacitus, \"Histories,\" Book I.\r\n\r\n[24] Montegazza \"L'Amour dans l'Humanite.\"\r\n\r\n[25] Matthew, ch. 19; 11 and 12.\r\n\r\n[26] I.

As the first,\r\nhe took it that they had granted him to be born a freeman, and not a\r\nslave; the second was that he was created a man, and not a woman. A\r\nsimilar thought finds utterance in the morning prayer of the Jews. They\r\npray: \"Blessed be Thou, our God and Lord of Hosts, _who hast not created\r\nme a woman_;\" the Jewish women, on the other hand, pray at the\r\ncorresponding place: \"_who hast created me after thy will_.\" The\r\ncontrast in the position of the sexes can find no more forcible\r\nexpression than it does in the saying of Plato, and in the different\r\nwording of the prayer among the Jews. The male is the real being, the\r\nmaster of the female. With the views of Plato and the Jews, the larger\r\npart of men agree, and many a woman also wishes that she had been born a\r\nman and not a woman. In this view lies reflected the condition of the\r\nfemale sex.\r\n\r\nWholly irrespective of the question whether woman is oppressed as a\r\nfemale proletarian, as sex she is oppressed in the modern world of\r\nprivate property. A number of checks and obstructions, unknown to man,\r\nexist for her, and hem her in at every step. Much that is allowed to man\r\nis forbidden to her; a number of social rights and privileges, enjoyed\r\nby the former, are, if exercised by her, a blot or a crime. She suffers\r\nboth as a social and a sex entity, and it is hard to say in which of the\r\ntwo respects she suffers more.\r\n\r\nOf all the natural impulses human beings are instinct with, along with\r\nthat of eating and drinking, the sexual impulse is the strongest. The\r\nimpulse to procreate the species is the most powerful expression of the\r\n\"Will to Live.\" It is implanted most strongly in every normally\r\ndeveloped human being. Upon maturity, its satisfaction is an actual\r\nnecessity for man's physical and mental health. Luther was perfectly\r\nright when he said: \"He who would resist the promptings of Nature, and\r\nprevent their going as Nature wills and must, _what else does he but\r\nendeavor to resist Nature's being Nature, that fire burn, water wet,\r\nthat man eat, drink or sleep_?\" These are words that should be graven in\r\ngranite over the doors of our churches, in which the \"sinful flesh\" is\r\nso diligently preached against. More strikingly no physician or\r\nphysiologist can describe the necessity for the satisfaction of the\r\ncraving for love on the part of a healthy being,--a craving that finds\r\nits expression in sexual intercourse.\r\n\r\nIt is a commandment of the human being to itself--a commandment that it\r\nmust obey if it wishes to develop normally and in health--that it\r\nneglect the exercise of no member of its body, deny gratification to no\r\nnatural impulse. Each member must fill the function, that it is intended\r\nfor by Nature, on penalty of atrophy and disease. The laws of the\r\nphysical development of man must be studied and observed, the same as\r\nthose of mental development. The mental activity of the human being is\r\nthe expression of the physiologic composition of its organs. The\r\ncomplete health of the former is intimately connected with the health of\r\nthe latter. A disturbance of the one inevitably has a disturbing effect\r\nupon the other. Nor do the so-called animal desires take lower rank than\r\nthe so-called mental ones. One set and the other are effects of the\r\nidentical combined organism: the influence of the two upon each other is\r\nmutual and continuous. This holds good for man as for woman.\r\n\r\nIt follows that, the knowledge of the properties of the sexual organs is\r\njust as needful as that of the organs which generate mental activity;\r\nand that man should bestow upon the cultivation of both an equal share\r\nof care. He should realize that organs and impulses, found implanted in\r\nevery human being, and that constitute a very essential part of his\r\nnature, aye, that, at certain periods of his life control him\r\nabsolutely, must not be objects of secrecy, of false shame and utter\r\nignorance. It follows, furthermore, that a knowledge of the physiology\r\nand anatomy of the sexual organs, together with their functions, should\r\nbe as general among men and women as any other branch of knowledge.\r\nEquipped with an accurate knowledge of our physical make-up, we would\r\nlook upon many a condition in life with eyes different from those we now\r\ndo. The question of removing existing evils would then, of itself, force\r\nitself upon those before whom society, to-day, passes by in silence and\r\nsolemn bashfulness, notwithstanding these evils command attention within\r\nthe precincts of every family. In all other matters, knowledge is held a\r\nvirtue, the worthiest and most beautiful aim of human endeavor--only not\r\nknowledge in such matters that are in closest relation with the essence\r\nand health of our own _Ego_, as well as the basis of all social\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nKant says: \"Man and woman only jointly constitute the complete being:\r\none sex supplements the other.\" Schopenhauer declares: \"The sexual\r\nimpulse is the fullest utterance of the will to live, hence it is the\r\nconcentration of all will-power;\" again: \"The affirmative declaration of\r\nthe will in favor of life is concentrated in the act of generation, and\r\nthat is its most decisive expression.\" In accord therewith says\r\nMainlaender: \"The center of gravity of human life lies in the sexual\r\ninstinct: it alone secures life to the individual, which is that which\r\nabove all else it wants.... To nothing else does man devote greater\r\nearnestness than to the work of procreation, and for the care of none\r\nother does he compress and concentrate the intensity of his will so\r\ndemonstratively as for the act of procreation.\" Finally, and before all\r\nof these, Buddha said: \"The sexual instinct is sharper than the hook\r\nwild elephants are tamed with; it is hotter than flames; it is like an\r\narrow, shot into the spirit of man.\"[58]\r\n\r\nSuch being the intensity of the sexual impulse, it is no wonder that\r\nsexual abstinence at the age of maturity affects the nervous system and\r\nthe whole organism of man, with one sex as well as the other, in such a\r\nmanner that it often leads to serious disturbances and manias; under\r\ncertain conditions even to insanity and death. True enough, the sexual\r\ninstinct does not assert itself with equal violence in all natures, and\r\nmuch can be done towards curbing it by education and self-control,\r\nespecially by avoiding the excitation resulting upon certain\r\nconversations and reading. It is thought that, in general, the impulse\r\nmanifests itself lighter with women than with men, and that the\r\nirritation is less potent with the former. It is even claimed that, with\r\nwoman, there is a certain repugnance for the sexual act. The minority is\r\nsmall of those with whom physiologic and psychologic dispositions and\r\nconditions engender such a difference. \"The union of the sexes is one of\r\nthe great laws of living Nature; man and woman are subject to it the\r\nsame as all other creatures, and can not transgress it, especially at a\r\nripe age, without their organism suffering more or less in\r\nconsequence.\"[59] Debay quotes among the diseases, caused by the\r\ninactivity of the sexual organs, satyriasis, nymphomania and hysteria;\r\nand he adds that celibacy exercises upon the intellectual powers,\r\nespecially with woman, a highly injurious effect. On the subject of the\r\nharmfulness of sexual abstinence by woman, Busch says:[60] \"Abstinence\r\nhas in all ages been considered particularly harmful to woman; indeed it\r\nis a fact that excess, as well as abstinence, affects the female\r\norganism equally harmfully, and the effects show themselves more\r\npronouncedly and intensively than with the male organism.\"\r\n\r\nIt may, accordingly, be said that man--be the being male or female--is\r\ncomplete in the measure in which, both as to organic and spiritual\r\nculture, the impulses and manifestations of life utter themselves in the\r\nsexes, and in the measure that they assume character and expression.\r\nEach sex of itself reached its highest development. \"With civilized\r\nman,\" says Klenke in his work \"Woman as Wife,\" \"the compulsion of\r\nprocreation is placed under the direction of the moral principle, and\r\nthat is guided by reason.\" This is true. Nevertheless, it were an\r\nimpossible task, even with the highest degree of freedom, wholly to\r\nsilence the imperative command for the preservation of the species,--a\r\ncommand that Nature planted in the normal, organic expression of the\r\nboth sexes. Where healthy individuals, male or female, have failed in\r\ntheir life-time to honor this duty towards Nature, _it is not with them\r\nan instance of the free exercise of the will_, even when so given out,\r\nor when, in self-deception, it is believed to be such. _It is the result\r\nof social obstacles, together with the consequences which follow in\r\ntheir wake; they restricted the right of Nature_; they allowed the\r\norgans to wilt; allowed the stamp of decay and of sexual vexation--both\r\nin point of appearance and of character--to be placed upon the whole\r\norganism; and, finally, brought on--through nervous distempers--diseased\r\ninclinations and conditions both of body and of mind. The man becomes\r\nfeminine, the woman masculine in shape and character. The sexual\r\ncontrast not having reached realization in the plan of Nature, each\r\nhuman being _remained one-sided, never reached its supplement, never\r\ntouched the acme of its existence_. In her work, \"The Moral Education of\r\nthe Young in Relation to Sex,\" Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell says: \"The sexual\r\nimpulse exists as an indispensable condition of life, and as the basis\r\nof society. It is the greatest force in human nature. Often undeveloped,\r\nnot even an object of thought, but none the less the _central fire of\r\nlife_, this inevitable instinct is the natural protector against any\r\npossibility of extinction.\"\r\n\r\nScience agrees, accordingly, with the opinion of the philosophers, and\r\nwith Luther's healthy common sense. It follows that every human being\r\nhas, not merely the right, but also the duty to satisfy the instincts,\r\nthat are intimately connected with its inmost being, that, in fact,\r\nimply existence itself. Hindered therein, rendered impossible to him\r\nthrough social institutions or prejudices, the consequence is that man\r\nis checked in the development of his being, is left to a stunted life\r\nand retrogression. What the consequences thereof are, our physicians,\r\nhospitals, insane asylums and prisons can tell,--to say nothing of the\r\nthousands of tortured family lives. In a book that appeared in Leipsic,\r\nthe author is of the opinion: \"The sexual impulse is neither moral nor\r\nimmoral; it is merely natural, like hunger and thirst: Nature knows\r\nnothing of morals;\"[61] nevertheless bourgeois society is far from a\r\ngeneral acceptance of this maxim.\r\n\r\nThe opinion finds wide acceptance among physicians and physiologists\r\nthat even a defectively equipped marriage is better than celibacy.\r\nExperience agrees therewith. In Bavaria there were, in 1858, not less\r\nthan 4,899 lunatics, 2,576 (53 per cent.) of them men, 2,323 (47 per\r\ncent.) women. The men were, accordingly, more strongly represented than\r\nthe women. Of the whole number, however, the _unmarried_ of both sexes\r\nran up to 81 per cent., the married only to 17 per cent., while of 2 per\r\ncent. the conjugal status was unknown. As a mitigation of the shocking\r\ndisproportion between the unmarried and the married, the circumstance\r\nmay be taken into consideration that a not small number of the unmarried\r\nwere insane from early childhood. In Hanover, in the year 1856, there\r\nwas one lunatic to every 457 unmarried, 564 widowed, 1,316 married\r\npeople. Most strikingly is the effect of unsatisfied sexual relations\r\nshown in the number of suicides among men and women. In general, the\r\nnumber of suicides is in all countries considerably higher among men\r\nthan among women. To every 1,000 female suicides there were in:[62]\r\n\r\n\r\n    England from 1872-76  2,861 men\r\n    Sweden    \"  1870-74  3,310  \"\r\n    France    \"  1871-76  3,695  \"\r\n    Italy     \"  1872-77  4,000  \"\r\n    Prussia   \"  1871-78  4,239  \"\r\n    Austria   \"  1873-78  4,586  \"\r\n\r\n\r\nBut between the ages of 21 and 30, the figures for _female suicides is\r\nin all European countries higher than for males_, due, as Oettingen\r\nassumes, to sexual causes. In Prussia the percentages of suicides\r\nbetween the ages of 21 to 30 were on an average:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Years.    Males.   Females.\r\n    1869-72     15.8      21.4\r\n    1873-78     15.7      21.5\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Saxony there were to every 1,000 suicides between the ages of 21 to\r\n30 these averages:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Years.     Males.   Females.\r\n    1854       14.95     18.64\r\n    1868       14.71     18.79\r\n\r\n\r\nFor widowed and divorced people also the percentage of suicides is\r\nlarger than the average. In Saxony there are seven times as many\r\nsuicides among divorced males, and three times as many among divorced\r\nfemales, as the average of suicides for males and females respectively.\r\nAgain, suicide is more frequent among divorced and widowed men and women\r\nwhen they are childless. Of 491 widowed suicides in Prussia (119 males\r\nand 372 females) 353 were childless.\r\n\r\nTaking into further consideration that, among the unmarried women, who\r\nare driven to suicide between the ages of 21 and 30, many a one is to be\r\nfound, who takes her life by reason of being betrayed, or because she\r\ncan not bear the consequences of a \"slip,\" the fact remains that sexual\r\nreasons play a decided _role_ in suicide at this age. Among female\r\nsuicides, the figure is large also for those between the ages of 16 to\r\n20, and the fact is probably likewise traceable to unsatisfied sexual\r\ninstinct, disappointment in love, secret pregnancy, or betrayal. On the\r\nsubject of the women of our days as sexual beings, Professor V.\r\nKrafft-Ebing expresses himself: \"A not-to-be-underrated source of\r\ninsanity with woman lies in her social position. Woman, by nature more\r\nprone than man to sexual needs, at least in the ideal sense of the term,\r\nknows no honorable means of gratifying the need other than marriage. At\r\nthe same time marriage offers her the only support. Through unnumbered\r\ngenerations her character has been built in this direction. Already the\r\nlittle girl plays mother with her doll. Modern life, with its demands\r\nupon culture, offers ever slighter prospects of gratification through\r\nmarriage. This holds especially with the upper classes, among whom\r\nmarriage is contracted later and more rarely. While man--as the\r\nstronger, and thanks to his greater intellectual and physical powers,\r\ntogether with his social position--supplies himself easily with sexual\r\ngratification, or, taken up with some occupation, that engages all his\r\nenergies, easily finds an equivalent, these paths are closed to single\r\nwomen. This leads, in the first place, consciously or unconsciously, to\r\ndissatisfaction with herself and the world, to morbid brooding. For a\r\nwhile, perhaps, relief is sought in religion; but in vain. Out of\r\nreligious enthusiasm, there spring with or without masturbation, a host\r\nof nervous diseases, among which hysteria and insanity are not rare.\r\nOnly thus is the fact explainable that insanity among single women\r\noccurs with greatest frequency between the ages of 25 and 35, that is to\r\nsay, the time when the bloom of youth, and, along therewith, hope\r\nvanishes; while with men, insanity occurs generally between the ages of\r\n35 and 50, the season of the strongest efforts in the struggle for\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n\"It certainly is no accident that, hand in hand with increasing\r\ncelibacy, the question of the emancipation of woman has come ever more\r\non the order of the day. I would have the question looked upon as a\r\ndanger signal, set up by the social position of woman in modern\r\nsociety--a position that grows ever more unbearable, due to increasing\r\ncelibacy; I would have it looked upon as the danger signal of a\r\njustified demand, made upon modern society, to furnish woman some\r\nequivalent for that to which she is assigned by Nature, and which modern\r\nsocial conditions partly deny her.\"[63]\r\n\r\nAnd Dr. H. Plotz, in his work, \"Woman in Nature and Ethnography,\"[64]\r\nsays in the course of his explanation of the results of ungratified\r\nsexual instincts upon unmarried women: \"It is in the highest degree\r\nnoteworthy, not for the physician only, but also for the anthropologist,\r\nthat there is an effective and never-failing means to check this process\r\nof decay (with old maids), but even to cause the lost bloom to return,\r\nif not in all its former splendor yet in a not insignificant\r\ndegree,--_pity only that our social conditions allow, or make its\r\napplication possible only in rare instances_. The means consist in\r\nregular and systematic sexual intercourse. The sight is not infrequent\r\nwith girls, who lost their bloom, or were not far from the withering\r\npoint, yet, the opportunity to marry having been offered them, that,\r\nshortly after marriage, their shape began to round up again, the roses\r\nto return to their cheeks, and their eyes to recover their one-time\r\nbrightness. _Marriage is, accordingly, the true fountain of youth for\r\nthe female sex._ Thus Nature has her firm laws, that implacably demand\r\ntheir dues. No 'vita praeter naturam,' no unnatural life, no attempt at\r\naccommodation to incompatible conditions of life, passes without leaving\r\nnoticeable traces of degeneration, upon the animal, as well as upon the\r\nhuman organism.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the effect that marriage and celibacy exercise upon the mind, the\r\nfollowing figures furnish testimony. In 1882, there were in Prussia, per\r\n10,000 inhabitants of the same conjugal status, 33.2 unmarried male and\r\n29.3 female lunatics, while the percentage of the married ones was 9.5\r\nfor men, and 9.5 for females, and of the widowed, 32.1 males, and 25.6\r\nfemales. Social conditions can not be considered healthy, that hinder a\r\nnormal satisfaction of the natural instincts, and lead to evils like\r\nthose just mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe question then rises: Has modern society met the demands for a\r\nnatural life, especially as concerns the female sex? If the question is\r\nanswered in the negative, this other rises: Can modern society meet the\r\ndemands? If both questions must be answered in the negative, then this\r\nthird arises: How can these demands be met?\r\n\r\n\"Marriage and the family are the foundation of the State; consequently,\r\nhe who attacks marriage and the family attacks society and the State,\r\nand undermines both\"--thus cry the defenders of the present order.\r\nUnquestionably, monogamous marriage, which flows from the bourgeois\r\nsystem of production and property, is one of the most important\r\ncornerstones of bourgeois or capitalist society; whether, however, such\r\nmarriage is in accord with natural wants and with a healthy development\r\nof human society, is another question. We shall prove that the marriage,\r\nfounded upon bourgeois property relations, is more or less a marriage by\r\ncompulsion, which leads numerous ills in its train, and which fails in\r\nits purpose quite extensively, if not altogether. We shall show,\r\nfurthermore, that it is a social institution, beyond the reach of\r\nmillions, and is by no means that marriage based upon love, which alone\r\ncorresponds with the natural purpose, as its praise-singers maintain.\r\n\r\nWith regard to modern marriage, John Stuart Mill exclaims: \"_Marriage is\r\nthe only form of slavery that the law recognizes._\" In the opinion of\r\nKant, man and woman constitute only jointly the full being. Upon the\r\nnormal union of the sexes rests the healthy development of the human\r\nrace. The natural gratification of the sexual instinct is a necessity\r\nfor the thorough physical and mental development of both man and woman.\r\nBut man is no animal. Mere physical satisfaction does not suffice for\r\nthe full gratification of his energetic and vehement instinct. He\r\nrequires also spiritual affinity and oneness with the being that he\r\ncouples with. Is that not the case, then the blending of the sexes is a\r\npurely mechanical act: such a marriage is immoral. It does not answer\r\nthe higher human demands. Only in the mutual attachment of two beings of\r\nopposite sexes can be conceived the spiritual ennobling of relations\r\nthat rest upon purely physical laws. Civilized man demands that the\r\nmutual attraction continue beyond the accomplishment of the sexual act,\r\nand _that it prolong its purifying influence upon the home that flows\r\nfrom the mutual union_.[65] The fact that these demands can not be made\r\nupon numberless marriages in modern society is what led Barnhagen von\r\nEnse to say: \"That which we saw with our own eyes, both with regard to\r\ncontracted marriages and marriages yet to be contracted, was not\r\ncalculated to give us a good opinion of such unions. On the contrary,\r\nthe whole institution, which was to have only love and respect for its\r\nfoundation, and which in all these instances (in Berlin) we saw founded\r\non everything but that, seemed to us mean and contemptible, and we\r\nloudly joined in the saying of Frederick Schlegel which we read in the\r\nfragments of the 'Atheneum': Almost all marriages are concubinages,\r\nleft-handed unions, or rather provisional attempts and distant\r\nresemblances at and of a true marriage, whose real feature consists,\r\naccording to all spiritual and temporal laws, in that two persons become\r\none.\"[66] Which is completely in the sense of Kant.\r\n\r\nThe duty towards and pleasure in posterity make permanent the love\r\nrelations of two persons, when such really exists. A couple that wishes\r\nto enter into matrimonial relations must, therefore, be first clear\r\nwhether the physical and moral qualities of the two are fit for such a\r\nunion. The answer should be arrived at uninfluenced; and that can happen\r\nonly, first, _by keeping away all other interests_, that have nothing to\r\ndo with the real object of the union,--the gratification of the natural\r\ninstinct, and the transmission of one's being in the propagation of the\r\nrace; secondly, by a certain degree of insight that curbs blind passion.\r\nSeeing, however, as we shall show, that _both conditions are, in\r\ninnumerable cases, absent in modern society, it follows that modern\r\nmarriage is frequently far from fulfilling its true purpose; hence that\r\nit is not just to represent it, as is done, in the light of an ideal\r\ninstitution_.\r\n\r\nHow large the number is of the marriages, contracted with views wholly\r\ndifferent from these, can, naturally, not be statistically given. The\r\nparties concerned are interested in having their marriage appear to the\r\nworld different from what it is in fact. There is on this field a state\r\nof hypocrisy peculiar to no earlier social period. And the State, the\r\npolitical representative of this society, has no interest, for the sake\r\nof curiosity, in initiating inquiries, the result of which would be to\r\nplace in dubious light the social system that is its very foundation.\r\nThe maxims, which the State observes with respect to the marrying of\r\nlarge divisions of its own officials and servants, _do not suffer the\r\nprinciple to be applied that, ostensibly, is the basis of marriage_.\r\n\r\nMarriage--and herewith the bourgeois idealists also agree--should be a\r\nunion that two persons enter into only out of mutual love, in order to\r\naccomplish their natural mission. This motive is, however, only rarely\r\npresent in all its purity. With the large majority of women, matrimony\r\nis looked upon as a species of institution for support, which they must\r\nenter into at any price. Conversely, a large portion of the men look\r\nupon marriage from a purely business standpoint, and from material\r\nview-points all the advantages and disadvantages are accurately\r\ncalculated. Even with those marriages, in which low egotistical motives\r\ndid not turn the scales, raw reality brings along so much that disturbs\r\nand dissolves, that only in rare instances are the expectations verified\r\nwhich, in their youthful enthusiasm and ardor, the couple had looked\r\nforward to.\r\n\r\nAnd quite naturally. If wedlock is to offer the spouses a contented\r\nconnubial life, it demands, together with mutual love and respect, _the\r\nassurance of material existence, the supply of that measure of the\r\nnecessaries of life and comfort which the two consider requisite for\r\nthemselves and their children_. The weight of cares, the hard struggle\r\nfor existence--these are the first nails in the coffin of conjugal\r\ncontent and happiness. The cares become heavier the more fruitful the\r\nmarriage proves itself, i. e., _in the measure in which the marriage\r\nfulfils its purpose_. The peasant, for instance, is pleased at every\r\ncalf that his cow brings him; he counts with delight the number of\r\nyoung that his sow litters; and he communicates the event with pleasure\r\nto his neighbors. But the same peasant looks gloomy when his wife\r\npresents him with an increase to his own brood--and large this may never\r\nbe--which he believes to be able to bring up without too much worry. His\r\ngloom is all the thicker if the new-born child is a _girl_.\r\n\r\nWe shall now show how, everywhere, marriages and births are completely\r\ncontrolled by the economic conditions. This is most classically\r\nexemplified in France. There, the allotment system prevails generally in\r\nthe country districts. Land, broken up beyond a certain limit, ceases to\r\nnourish a family. The unlimited division of land, legally permissible,\r\nthe French peasant counteracts by his rarely giving life to more than\r\ntwo children,--hence the celebrated and notorious \"two child system,\"\r\nthat has grown into a social institution in France, and that, to the\r\nalarm of her statesmen, keeps the population stationary, in some\r\nprovinces even registering considerable retrogression. The number of\r\nbirths is steadily on the decline in France; but not in France only,\r\nalso in most of the civilized lands. Therein is found expressed a\r\ndevelopment in our social conditions, that should give the ruling\r\nclasses cause to ponder. In 1881 there were 937,057 children born in\r\nFrance; in 1890, however, only 838,059; accordingly, the births in 1890\r\nfell 98,998 behind the year 1881. Characteristic, however, is the\r\ncircumstance that the number of _illegitimate_ births in France was\r\n70,079 for the year 1881; that, during the period between 1881 and 1890,\r\nthe number reached high-water mark in 1884, with 75,754; and that the\r\nnumber was still 71,086 strong in 1890. Accordingly, the whole of the\r\ndecline of births fell exclusively upon the legitimate births. This\r\ndecline in births, and, we may add, in marriages also, is, as will be\r\nshown, a characteristic feature, noticeable throughout the century. To\r\nevery 10,000 French population, there were births in the years:\r\n\r\n\r\n    1801   333\r\n    1821   307\r\n    1831   303\r\n    1841   282\r\n    1851   270\r\n    1856   261\r\n    1868   269\r\n    1886   230\r\n    1890   219\r\n\r\n\r\nThis amounts to a decline of births in 1890, as against 1801, of 114 to\r\nevery 10,000 inhabitants. It is imaginable that such figures cause\r\nserious headaches to the French statesmen and politicians. But France\r\ndoes not stand alone in this. For a long time Germany has been\r\npresenting a similar phenomenon. In Germany, to every 10,000 population\r\nthere were births in the years:\r\n\r\n\r\n    1869   406\r\n    1876   403\r\n    1880   390\r\n    1883   358\r\n    1887   369.4\r\n    1890   357.6\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Germany too reveals, in the space of only 21 years, a\r\ndecline of 49 births to every 10,000 inhabitants. Similarly with the\r\nother States of Europe. To every 10,000 population there were live\r\nbirths:\r\n\r\n\r\n                       From        From\r\n      States.       1865-1867.  1886-1888. Decrease. Increase.\r\n    Ireland            262         231        31       ..\r\n    Scotland           353         313        40       ..\r\n    England and Wales  353         314        39       ..\r\n    Holland            388         344        44       ..\r\n    Belgium            320         293        27       ..\r\n    Switzerland        320         278        42       ..\r\n    Austria            374         380        ..        6\r\n    Hungary            399         445        ..       46\r\n    Italy              378         371         7       ..\r\n    Sweden             320         297        23       ..\r\n    Norway             344         308        36       ..\r\n\r\n\r\nThe decline in births is, accordingly, pretty general, only that, of all\r\nEuropean States, it is strongest in France. Between 1886 and 1888,\r\nFrance had, to every 1,000 inhabitants, an average of 23.9 births,\r\nEngland 32.9, Prussia 41.27, and Russia 48.8.\r\n\r\nThese facts show that the birth of a human being, the \"image of God,\" as\r\nreligious people express it, ranks generally much cheaper than new-born\r\ndomestic animals. What this fact does reveal is the _unworthy_ condition\r\nthat we find ourselves in,--and it is mainly the female sex which\r\nsuffers thereunder. In many respects, modern views distinguish\r\nthemselves but little from those of barbarous nations. Among the latter,\r\nnew-born babes were frequently killed, and such a fate fell to the lot\r\nof girls mainly; many a half-wild race does so to this day. We no longer\r\nkill the girls; we are too civilized for that; but they are only too\r\noften treated like pariahs by society and the family. The stronger man\r\ncrowds them everywhere back in the struggle for existence; and if,\r\ndriven by the love for life, they still take up the battle, they are\r\nvisited with hatred by the stronger sex, as unwelcome competitors. It is\r\nespecially the men in the higher ranks of society who are bitterest\r\nagainst female competition, and oppose it most fiercely. That workingmen\r\ndemand the exclusion of female labor on principle happens but rarely. A\r\nmotion to that effect being made in 1877, at a French Labor Convention,\r\nthe large majority declared against it. Since then, it is just with the\r\nclass-conscious workingmen of all countries, that the principle, that\r\nworking-women are beings with equal rights with themselves makes immense\r\nprogress. This was shown especially by the resolutions of the\r\nInternational Labor Congress of Paris in 1889. The class-conscious\r\nworkingman knows that the modern economic development forces woman to\r\nset herself up as a competitor with man; but he also knows that, to\r\nprohibit female labor, would be as senseless an act as the prohibition\r\nof the use of machinery. Hence he strives to enlighten woman on her\r\nposition in society, and _to educate her into a fellow combatant in the\r\nstruggle for the emancipation of the proletariat from capitalism_. True\r\nenough,--due to the ever more widespread employment of female labor in\r\nagriculture, industry, commerce and the trades--the family life of the\r\nworkingman is destroyed, and the degenerating effects of the double yoke\r\nof work for a living, and of household duties, makes rapid progress in\r\nthe female sex. Hence the endeavor to keep women by legislative\r\nenactments, from occupations that are especially injurious to the female\r\norganism, and by means of protective laws to safeguard her as a mother\r\nand rearer of children. On the other hand, the struggle for existence\r\nforces women to turn in ever larger numbers to industrial occupations.\r\nIt is _married woman_, more particularly, who is called upon to increase\r\nthe meager earnings of her husband with her work,--and she is\r\nparticularly welcome to the employer.[67]\r\n\r\nModern society is without doubt more cultured than any previous one, and\r\nwoman stands correspondingly higher. Nevertheless, the views concerning\r\nthe relations of the two sexes have remained at bottom the same.\r\nProfessor L. von Stein published a book,[68]--a work, be it said in\r\npassing, that corresponds ill with its title--in which he gives a\r\npoetically colored picture of modern marriage, as it supposedly is. Even\r\nin this picture the subaltern position of woman towards the \"lion\" man\r\nis made manifest. Stein says among other things: \"Man deserves a being\r\nthat not only loves, but also understands him. He deserves a person with\r\nwhom not only the heart beats for him, but whose hand may also smooth\r\nhis forehead, and whose presence radiates peace, rest, order, a quiet\r\ncommand over herself and the thousand and one things upon which he daily\r\nreverts: he wants someone who spreads over all these things that\r\nindescribable aroma of womanhood, one who is the life-giving warmth to\r\nthe life of the house.\"\r\n\r\nIn this song of praise of woman lies concealed her own degradation, and\r\nalong therewith, the low egotism of man. The professor depicts woman as\r\na vaporous being, that, nevertheless, shall be equipped with the\r\nnecessary knowledge of practical arithmetic; know how to keep the\r\nbalance between \"must\" and \"can\" in the household; and, for the rest,\r\nfloat zephyr-fashion, like sweet spring-tide, about the master of the\r\nhouse, the sovereign lion, in order to spy every wish from his eyes, and\r\nwith her little soft hand unwrinkle the forehead, that he, \"the master\r\nof the house,\" perchance himself crumpled, while brooding over his own\r\nstupidity. In short, the professor pictures a woman and a marriage such\r\nas, out of a hundred, hardly one is to be found, or, for that matter,\r\ncan exist. Of the many thousand unhappy marriages; of the large number\r\nof women who never get so far as to wed; and also of the millions, who,\r\nlike beasts of burden beside their husbands, have to drudge and wear\r\nthemselves out from early morn till late to earn a bit of bread for the\r\ncurrent day,--of all of these the learned gentleman knows nothing. With\r\nall these wretched beings, hard, raw reality wipes off the poetic\r\ncoloring more easily than does the hand the colored dust of the wings of\r\na butterfly. One look, cast by the professor at those unnumbered female\r\nsufferers, would have seriously disturbed his poetically colored\r\npicture, and spoiled his concept. The women, whom he sees, make up but a\r\ntrifling minority, and that these stand upon the plane of our times is\r\nto be doubted.\r\n\r\nAn oft-quoted sentence runs: \"The best gauge of the culture of a people\r\nis the position which woman occupies.\" We grant that; but it will be\r\nshown that our so much vaunted culture has little to brag about. In his\r\nwork, \"The Subjection of Woman,\"--the title is typical of the opinion\r\nthat the author holds regarding the modern position of woman--John\r\nStuart Mill says: \"The lives of men have become more domestic, growing\r\ncivilization lays them under more obligations towards women.\" This is\r\nonly partly true. In so far as honorable conjugal relations may exist\r\nbetween husband and wife, Mill's statement is true; but it is doubtful\r\nwhether the statement applies to even a strong minority. Every sensible\r\nman will consider it an advantage to himself if woman step forward into\r\nlife out of the narrow circle of domestic activities, and become\r\nfamiliar with the currents of the times. The \"chains\" he thereby lays\r\nupon himself do not press him. On the other hand, the question arises\r\nwhether modern life does not introduce into married life factors, that,\r\nto a higher degree than formerly, act destructively upon marriage.\r\n\r\nMonogamous marriage became, from the start, an object of material\r\nspeculation. The man who marries endeavors to wed property, along with a\r\nwife, and this was one of the principal reasons why daughters, after\r\nbeing at first excluded from the right to inherit, when descent in the\r\nmale line prevailed, soon again reacquired the right. But never in\r\nearlier days was marriage so cynically, in open market, so to speak, an\r\nobject of speculation; a money transaction, as it is to-day. To-day\r\ntrading in marriage is frequently conducted among the property\r\nclasses--among the propertyless the practice has no sense--with such\r\nshamelessness, that the oft-repeated phrase concerning the \"sanctity\" of\r\nmarriage is the merest mockery. This phenomenon, as everything else, has\r\nits ample foundation. At no previous period was it, as it is to-day,\r\nhard for the large majority of people to raise themselves into a\r\ncondition of well-being, corresponding to the then general conceptions;\r\nnor was at any time the justified striving for an existence worthy of\r\nhuman beings so general as it is to-day. He who does not reach the goal,\r\nfeels his failure all the more keenly, just because all believe to have\r\nan equal right to enjoyment. _Formally_, there are _no_ rank or class\r\ndistinctions. Each wishes to obtain that which, according to his\r\nstation, he considers a goal worth striving for, in order to come at\r\nfruition. But many are called and few are chosen. In order that one may\r\nlive comfortably in capitalist society, twenty others must pine; and in\r\norder that one may wallow in all manner of enjoyment, hundreds, if not\r\nthousands, of others must renounce the happiness of life. But each\r\nwishes to be of that minority of favored ones, and seizes every means,\r\nthat promise to take him to the desired goal, provided he does not\r\ncompromise himself too deeply. One of the most convenient means, and,\r\nwithal, nearest at hand, to reach the privileged social station, is the\r\n_money-marriage_. The desire, on the one hand, to obtain as much money\r\nas possible, and, on the other, the aspiration after rank, titles and\r\nhonor thus find their mutual satisfaction in the so-called upper classes\r\nof society. There, marriage is generally considered a business\r\ntransaction; it is a purely conventional bond, which both parties\r\nrespect externally, while, for the rest, each often acts according to\r\nhis or her own inclination. Marriage for political reasons, practiced in\r\nthe higher classes, need here to be mentioned only for the sake of\r\ncompleteness. With these marriages also, as a rule, the privilege has\r\ntacitly existed--of course, again, for the husband to a much higher\r\ndegree than for the wife--that the parties keep themselves scathless,\r\n_outside of the bonds of wedlock_, according as their whims may point,\r\nor their needs dictate. There have been periods in history when it was\r\npart of the _bon ton_ with a Prince to keep mistresses: it was one of\r\nthe princely attributes. Thus, according to Scherr, did Frederick\r\nWilliam I. of Prussia (1713-1740), otherwise with a reputation for\r\nsteadiness, keep up, at least for the sake of appearances, relations\r\nwith a General's wife. On the other hand, it is a matter of public\r\nnotoriety that, for instance, August the Strong, King of Poland and\r\nSaxony, gave life to 300 illegitimate children; and Victor Emanuel of\r\nItaly, the _re galantuomo_, left behind 32 illegitimate children. There\r\nis still extant a romantically located little German residence city, in\r\nwhich are at least a dozen charming villas, that the corresponding\r\n\"father of his country\" had built as places of recreation for his\r\nresigned mistresses. On this head thick books could be written: as is\r\nwell known, there is an extensive library on these piquant matters.\r\n\r\nThe inside history of most of the German princely courts and noble\r\nfamilies is to the informed an almost uninterrupted _chronique\r\nscandaleuse_, and not infrequently has it been stained with crimes of\r\nblackest dye. In sight of these facts, it certainly is imperative upon\r\nthe sycophantic painters of history, not only to leave untouched the\r\nquestion of the \"legitimacy\" of the several successive \"fathers and\r\nmothers of their country,\" but also to take pains to represent them as\r\npatterns of all virtues, as faithful husbands and good mothers. Not yet\r\nhas the breed of the augurs died out; they still live, as did their\r\nRoman prototypes, on the ignorance of the masses.\r\n\r\nIn every large town, there are certain places and days when the higher\r\nclasses meet, mainly for the purpose of match-making. These gatherings\r\nare, accordingly, quite fitly termed \"marriage exchanges.\" Just as on\r\nthe exchanges, speculation and chaffer play here the leading _role_, nor\r\nare deception and swindle left out. Officers, loaded with debts, but who\r\ncan hold out an old title of nobility; _roues_, broken down with\r\ndebauchery, who seek to restore their ruined health in the haven of\r\nwedlock, and need a nurse; manufacturers, merchants, bankers, who face\r\nbankruptcy, not infrequently the penitentiary also, and wish to be\r\nsaved; finally, all those who are after money and wealth, or a larger\r\nquantity thereof, government office-holders among them, with prospects\r\nof promotion, but meanwhile in financial straits;--all turn up as\r\ncustomers at these exchanges, and ply the matrimonial trade. Quite\r\noften, at such transactions, it is all one whether the prospective wife\r\nbe young or old, handsome or ugly, straight or bent, educated or\r\nignorant, religious or frivolous, Christian or Jew. Was it not a saying\r\nof a celebrated statesman: \"The marriage of a Christian stallion with a\r\nJewish mare is to be highly recommended\"?[69] The figure,\r\ncharacteristically borrowed from the horse-fair, meets, as experience\r\nteaches, with loud applause from the higher circles of our society.\r\nMoney makes up for all defects, and outweighs all vices. The German\r\npenal code punishes[70] the coupler with long terms of imprisonment;\r\nwhen, however, parents, guardians and relatives couple their children,\r\nwards or kin to a hated man or woman only for the sake of money, of\r\nprofit, of rank, in short, for the sake of external benefits, there is\r\nno District Attorney ready to take charge, and yet a crime has been\r\ncommitted. There are numerous well organized matrimonial bureaus, with\r\nmale and female panders of all degrees, out for prey, in search of the\r\nmale and female candidates for the \"holy bonds of matrimony.\" Such\r\nbusiness is especially profitable when the \"work\" is done for the\r\nmembers of the upper classes. In 1878 there was a criminal trial in\r\nVienna of a female pander on the charge of poisoning, and ended with her\r\nbeing sentenced to fifteen years in the penitentiary. At the trial it\r\nwas established that the French Ambassador in Vienna, Count Bonneville,\r\nhad paid the pander 12,000 florins for procuring his own wife. Other\r\nmembers of the high aristocracy were likewise highly compromised through\r\nthe trial. Evidently, certain Government officials had left the woman to\r\npursue her dark and criminal practices for many years. The \"why\" thereof\r\nis surely no secret. Similar stories are told from the capital of the\r\nGerman Empire. During recent years, it is the daughters and heirs of the\r\nrich American capitalist class, who, on their side, aspire after rank\r\nand honors, not to be had in their own American home, that have become a\r\nspecial subject of matrimonial trading for the needy noblemen of Europe.\r\nUpon these particular practices characteristic light is thrown by a\r\nseries of articles that appeared in the fall of 1889 in a portion of the\r\nGerman press. According thereto, a _chevalier d'industry_ nobleman,\r\ndomiciled in California, had recommended himself as a matrimonial agent\r\nin German and Austrian papers. The offers that he received amply betray\r\nthe conception concerning the sanctity of marriage and its \"ethical\"\r\nside prevalent in the corresponding circles. Two Prussian officers of\r\nthe Guards, both, as they say themselves, belonging to the oldest\r\nnobility of Prussia, declared that they were ready to enter into\r\nnegotiations for marriage because, as they frankly confessed, they owed\r\ntogether 60,000 marks. In their letter to the pander they say literally:\r\n\"It is understood that we shall pay no money in advance. You will\r\nreceive your remuneration after the wedding trip. Recommend us only to\r\nladies against whose families no objections can be raised. It is also\r\nvery desirable to be introduced to ladies of attractive appearance. If\r\ndemanded, we shall furnish, for discreet use, our own pictures to your\r\nagent, after he shall have given us the details, and shown us the\r\npictures, etc. We consider the whole affair strictly confidential and as\r\na matter of honor (?), and, of course, demand the same from you. We\r\nexpect a speedy answer through your agent in this place, if you have\r\none. Berlin, Friedrichstrasse 107, December 15, 1889. Baron v. M----,\r\nArthur v. W----.\"\r\n\r\nAn Austrian nobleman also, Karl Freiherr v. M---- of Goeding in Moravia,\r\nseized the opportunity to angle for a rich American bride, and to this\r\nend sent to the swindle-bureau the following letter:\r\n\r\n\"According to a notice in the papers of this place, you are acquainted\r\nwith American ladies who wish to marry. In this connection I place\r\nmyself at your service, but must inform you that I have no fortune\r\nwhatever. I am of very old noble stock (Baron), 34 years old, single,\r\nwas a cavalry officer and am at present engaged in building railroads. I\r\nshould be pleased to inspect one or more pictures, which, upon my word\r\nof honor, I shall return. Should you require my picture, I shall forward\r\nsame to you. I also request you to give me fuller information. Expecting\r\na speedy answer in this matter, I remain, very respectfully, your Karl\r\nFreiherr v. M----, Goeding, Moravia, Austria, November 29, 1889.\"\r\n\r\nA young German nobleman, Hans v. H----, wrote from London that he was 5\r\nfeet 10 tall, of an old noble family, and employed in the diplomatic\r\nservice. He made the confession that his fortune had been greatly\r\nreduced through unsuccessful betting at the horse races, and hence found\r\nhimself obliged to be on the lookout for a rich bride, so as to be able\r\nto cover his deficit. He was, furthermore, ready to undertake a trip to\r\nthe United States forthwith.\r\n\r\nThe _chevalier d'industry_ in question claimed that, besides several\r\ncounts, barons, etc., three Princes and sixteen dukes had reported to\r\nhim as candidates for marriage. But not noblemen only, bourgeois also\r\nlonged for rich American women. An architect, Max W---- of Leipsic,\r\ndemanded a bride who should possess not only money, but beauty and\r\nculture also. From Kehl on the Rhine, a young mill-owner, Robert D----,\r\nwrote that he would be satisfied with a bride who had but 400,000 marks,\r\nand he promised in advance to make her happy.\r\n\r\nBut why look so far, when at hand the quarry is rich! A very\r\npatriotic-conservative Leipsic paper, which plumes itself very\r\nparticularly upon its Christianity, contained in the spring of 1894 an\r\nadvertisement, that ran thus: \"A cavalry officer of the Guards, of\r\nlarge, handsome build, noble, 27 years of age, desires a financial\r\nmarriage. Please address, Count v. W. I., Post Office General Delivery,\r\nDresden.\" In comparison with the fellow who makes so cynical an offer,\r\nthe street-walker, who, out of bitter necessity, plies her trade, is a\r\nparagon of decency and virtue. Similar advertisements are found almost\r\nevery day in the papers of _all_ political parties--_except the Social\r\nDemocratic_. A Social Democratic editor or manager, who would accept\r\nsuch or similar advertisements for his paper, would be expelled from his\r\nparty as dishonorable. The capitalist press is not troubled at such\r\nadvertisements: they bring in money: and it is of the mind of the\r\nEmperor Vespasian,--_non olet_, it does not smell. Yet all that does not\r\nhinder that same press from going rabid mad at \"the marriage-undermining\r\ntendencies of Socialism.\" Never yet was there an age more hypocritical\r\nthan the one we are living in. With the view to demonstrate the fact\r\nonce more, the above instances were cited.\r\n\r\nBureaus of information for marriage,--that's what the advertisement\r\npages of most of the newspapers of our day are. Whosoever, be it male\r\nor female, finds near at hand nothing desirable, entrusts his or her\r\nheart's wants to the pious-conservative or moral-liberal press, that, in\r\nconsideration of cash and without coaxing, sees to it that the kindred\r\nsouls meet. With illustrations, taken on any one day from a number of\r\nlarge newspapers, whole pages, could be filled. Off and on the\r\ninteresting fact also crops out that even clergymen are sought for\r\nhusbands, and, _vice versa_, clergymen angle for wives, with the aid of\r\nadvertisements. Occasionally, the suitors also offer to overlook a\r\n_slip_, provided the looked-for woman be rich. In short, the moral\r\nturpitude of certain social circles of our society can be pilloried no\r\nbetter than by this sort of courtship.\r\n\r\nState and Church play in such \"holy matrimony\" a by no means handsome\r\n_role_. Whether the civil magistrate or clergyman, on whom may devolve\r\nthe duty to celebrate the marriage, be convinced that the bridal couple\r\nbefore him has been brought together by the vilest of practices; whether\r\nit be manifest that, neither in point of age nor that of bodily or\r\nmental qualities, the two are compatible with each other; whether, for\r\ninstance, the bride be twenty and the bridegroom seventy years old, or\r\nthe reverse; whether the bride be young, handsome and joyful, and the\r\nbridegroom old, ridden with disease and crabbed;--whatever the case, it\r\nconcerns not the representative of the State or the Church; it is not\r\nfor them to look into that. The marriage bond is \"blessed,\"--as a rule,\r\nblessed with all the greater solemnity in proportion to the size of the\r\nfee for the \"holy office.\"\r\n\r\nWhen, later, such a marriage proves a most unfortunate one--as foreseen\r\nby everybody, by the ill-starred victim, in most instances the woman,\r\nherself,--and either party decides to separate, then, State and\r\nChurch,--who never first inquire whether real love and natural, moral\r\nimpulses, or only naked, obscene egotism tie the knot--now raise the\r\ngreatest difficulties. At present, moral repulsion is but rarely\r\nrecognized a sufficient ground for separation; at present, only palpable\r\nproofs, proofs that always dishonor or lower one of the parties in\r\npublic esteem, are, as a rule, demanded; separation is not otherwise\r\ngranted. That the Roman Catholic Church does not allow divorces,--except\r\nby special dispensation of the Pope, which is hard to obtain, and, at\r\nbest, only from board and bed--only renders all the worse the\r\nconditions, under which all Catholic countries are suffering. Germany\r\nhas the prospect of receiving, in the not too far distant future, a\r\ncivil code that shall embrace the whole Empire. It is, therefore, a\r\nside-light upon our times that, although even the superficial observer\r\nmust reach the conclusion that at no previous period have unhappy\r\nmarriages been so numerous as now--a natural consequence of our whole\r\nsocial development--the new draft for a civil code still renders divorce\r\nmaterially difficult. It is but a fresh instance of the old\r\nexperience,--a social system, in the throes of dissolution, seeks to\r\nkeep itself up by artificial means and compulsion, and to deceive itself\r\nupon its actual state. In declining Rome, marriage and births were\r\nsought to be promoted by premiums: in the German Empire, whose social\r\norder stands under a constellation similar with that of the decaying\r\nEmpire of the Caesars, it is now sought to prevent the ever more\r\nfrequent desire for the dissolution of marriage by means of forcible\r\nconstraints.\r\n\r\nThus people remain against their will chained to each other through\r\nlife. One party becomes the slave of the other, compelled to submit out\r\nof \"conjugal duty\" to that other's most intimate embraces, which,\r\nperhaps, it abhors worse than insult or ill-treatment. Fully justified\r\nis Montegazza's dictum:[71] \"There is probably no worse torture than\r\nthat which compels a human being to put up with the caresses of a person\r\nit does not love.\"\r\n\r\nWe ask, Is such a marriage--and their number is infinite--not worse than\r\nprostitution? The prostitute has, to a certain degree, the freedom to\r\nwithdraw from her disgraceful pursuit; moreover, she enjoys the\r\nprivilege, if she does not live in a public house, to reject the\r\npurchase of the embraces of him who, for whatever reason, may be\r\ndistasteful to her. But a sold married woman must submit to the embraces\r\nof her husband, even though she have a hundred reasons to hate and\r\ndespise him.\r\n\r\nWhen in advance, and with the knowledge of both parties, marriage is\r\ncontracted as a marriage for money or rank, then, as a rule, matters lie\r\nmore favorably. The two accommodate themselves mutually, and a _modus\r\nvivendi_ is established. They want no scandal, and regard for their\r\nchildren compels them to avoid any, although it is the children who\r\nsuffer most under a cold, loveless life on the part of their parents,\r\neven if such a life does not develop into enmity, quarrel and\r\ndissension. Often accommodation is reached in order to avoid material\r\nloss. As a rule it is the husband, whose conduct is the rock against\r\nwhich marriage is dashed. This appears from the actions for divorce. In\r\nvirtue of his dominant position, he can indemnify himself elsewhere when\r\nthe marriage is not pleasing to him, and he can not find satisfaction in\r\nit. The wife is not so free to step on side-roads, partly because, as\r\nthe receiving sex, such action is, for physiologic reasons, a much more\r\nrisky one on her part; then, also, because every infraction of conjugal\r\nfidelity is imputed a crime to her, which neither the husband nor\r\nsociety pardons. Woman alone makes a \"slip\"--be she wife, widow or maid;\r\nman, at worst, has acted \"incorrectly.\" One and the same act is judged\r\nby society with wholly different standards, according as it be committed\r\nby a man or a woman. And, as a rule, women themselves judge a \"fallen\"\r\nsister most severely and pitilessly.[72]\r\n\r\nAs a rule, only in cases of crassest infidelity or maltreatment, does\r\nthe wife decide upon divorce. She is generally in a materially dependent\r\nposition, and compelled to look upon marriage as a means of support:\r\nmoreover, as a divorced wife, she finds herself socially in no enviable\r\nsituation: unless special reasons render intercourse with her desirable,\r\nshe is considered and treated by society as a neuter, so to speak. When,\r\ndespite all this, most actions for divorce proceed from wives, the\r\ncircumstance is an evidence of the heavy moral torture that they lie\r\nunder. In France, even before the new divorce law came into effect\r\n(1884), by far the more numerous actions for separation from bed and\r\nboard came from women. For an absolute divorce they could apply only if\r\nthe husband took his concubine into the married home, against the will\r\nof his wife. Actions for separations from bed and board occurred:[73]\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Average Per   Average Per Year\r\n      Years.

In the Kingdom of Saxony, during the period of 1860-1868, there\r\nwere instituted, all told, 8,402 actions for divorce; of these, 3,537\r\n(42 per cent.) were by men, 4,865 (58 per cent.) by wives.\r\n\r\nIn the period from 1871 to 1878, there were actions for divorce in\r\nSaxony[74]:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Year.

The total\r\nactions for divorce increased, however, in Saxony, as in France, much\r\nfaster than population. In Switzerland, during the year 1892, there were\r\ngranted 1,036 applications for divorce. Of these, wives had instituted\r\n493, husbands 229, and both parties 314.\r\n\r\nStatistics teach us, however, not alone that wives institute the larger\r\nnumber of actions for divorce; they also teach us that the number of\r\ndivorces is in rapid increase. In France, divorce has been regulated\r\nanew by law since 1884. Since then, divorces have greatly increased from\r\nyear to year. The number of divorces, and years they fell in, were as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    1884   1,657\r\n    1885   2,477\r\n    1886   2,950\r\n    1887   3,636\r\n    1888   4,708\r\n    1889   4,786\r\n    1890   5,457\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Vienna there were, from 1870 to 1871, 148 divorces; they increased\r\nfrom year to year; from 1878 to 1879 they ran up to 319 cases.[75] But\r\nin Vienna, being a preponderatingly Catholic city, divorce is hard to\r\nobtain. That notwithstanding, about the year 1885 a Vienna Judge made\r\nthe remark: \"Complaints on the ground of broken marriage vows are as\r\nfrequent as complaints for broken window-panes.\" In England and Wales\r\nthere was, in 1867, 1 divorce to every 1,378 marriages, but in 1877\r\nthere was 1 to every 652 marriages; and in 1886, 1 to as few as 527. In\r\nthe United States the number of divorces for 1867 was 9,937, and for\r\n1886 as many as 25,535. The total number of divorces in the United\r\nStates between 1867 and 1886 was 328,716, and the fault fell in 216,176\r\ncases upon the husband, in 112,540 upon the wife.\r\n\r\nRelatively speaking, the largest number of divorces occurs in the United\r\nStates. The proportion between marriages and divorces during the period\r\nof 1867 to 1886 stood for those States in which an accurate record is\r\nkept:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              Marriages\r\n                                            to Every One\r\n      States.

The reasons why in the\r\nUnited States divorces are more frequent than in any other country, may\r\nbe sought in the circumstance, first, that divorce is there more easily\r\nobtained than elsewhere; secondly, that _women occupy in the United\r\nStates a far freer position than in any other country, hence are less\r\ninclined to allow themselves to be tyrannised by their marital\r\nlords_.[76]\r\n\r\nIn Germany there was, by judicial decision, 1 dissolution of marriage--\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the Years  To Population.

First of all must\r\nthe legislation on the subject be kept in mind, which in one country\r\nmakes divorce difficult, in another easier, more so in some, less in\r\nothers. Only in the second instance does the condition of morality come\r\ninto consideration, i. e., the average reasons that, now the husbands,\r\nthen the wives, consider determining factors in applying for separation.\r\nBut all these figures combine in establishing that divorces increase\r\nmuch faster than population; and that they _increase_ while marriages\r\n_decline_. About this, more later.\r\n\r\nOn the question how the actions for divorce distribute themselves among\r\nthe several strata of society, there is only one computation at our\r\ndisposal, from Saxony, but which is from the year 1851.[77] At that\r\ntime, to each 100,000 marriages, there were actions for divorce from the\r\nstratum of\r\n\r\n\r\n    Domestic servants        289 or 1 application to 346 marriages\r\n    Day laborers             324 or 1 application to 309 marriages\r\n    Government employes      337 or 1 application to 289 marriages\r\n    Craftsmen and merchants  354 or 1 application to 283 marriages\r\n    Artists and scientists   485 or 1 application to 206 marriages\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the actions for divorce were at that period in Saxony 50\r\nper cent. more frequent in the _higher_ than in the _lower_ social\r\nstrata.\r\n\r\nThe increasing number of divorces signifies that, in general, the\r\nmarriage relations are becoming ever more unfavorable, and that the\r\nfactors multiply which destroy marriage. On the other hand, they also\r\nfurnish evidence that an ever larger number of spouses, women in\r\nparticular, decide to shake off the unbearable oppressing yoke.\r\n\r\nBut the evils of matrimony increase, and the corruption of marriage\r\ngains ground in the same measure as the struggle for existence waxes\r\nsharper, and marriage becomes ever more a money-match, or be it,\r\nmarriage by purchase. The increasing difficulty, moreover, of supporting\r\na family determines many to renounce marriage altogether; and thus the\r\nsaying that woman's activity should be limited to the house, and that\r\nshe should fill her calling as housewife and mother, becomes ever more\r\n_a senseless phrase_. On the other hand, the conditions can not choose\r\nbut favor the gratification of sexual intercourse outside of wedlock.\r\nHence the number of prostitutes increases, while the number of marriages\r\ndecreases. Besides that, the number increases of those who suffer from\r\nunnatural gratification of the sexual instinct.\r\n\r\nAmong the property classes, not infrequently the wife sinks, just as in\r\nold Greece, to the level of a mere apparatus for the procreation of\r\nlegitimate offspring, of warder of the house, or of nurse to a husband,\r\nwrecked by debauchery. The husbands keep for their pleasure and physical\r\ndesires hetairae--styled among us courtesans or mistresses--who live in\r\nelegant abodes, in the handsomest quarters of the city. Others, whose\r\nmeans do not allow them to keep mistresses, disport themselves, after\r\nmarriage as before, with Phrynes, for whom their hearts beat stronger\r\nthan for their own wives. With the Phrynes they amuse themselves; and\r\nquite a number of the husbands among the \"property and cultured\r\nclasses\" is so corrupt that it considers these entertainments in\r\norder.[78]\r\n\r\nIn the upper and middle classes of society, the money matches and\r\nmatches for social position are the mainspring of the evils of married\r\nlife; but, over and above that, marriage is made rank by the lives these\r\nclasses lead. This holds good particularly with regard to the women, who\r\nfrequently give themselves over to idleness or to corrupting pursuits.\r\nTheir intellectual food often consists in the reading of equivocal\r\nromances and obscene literature, in seeing and hearing frivolous\r\ntheatrical performances, and the fruition of sensuous music; in\r\nexhilarating nervous stimulants; in conversations on the pettiest\r\nsubjects, or scandals about the dear fellow mortals. Along therewith,\r\nthey rush from one enjoyment into another, from one banquet to another,\r\nand hasten in summer to the baths and summer retreats to recover from\r\nthe excesses of the winter, and to find fresh subjects for talk. The\r\n_chronique scandaleuse_ recruits itself from this style of life: people\r\nseduce and are seduced.\r\n\r\nIn the lower classes money-matches are unknown, as a rule, although they\r\noccasionally do play a role. No one can wholly withdraw himself from the\r\ninfluence of the society he lives in,--and the existing social\r\nconditions exercise a particularly depressing influence upon the\r\ncircumstances of the lower classes. As a rule, the workingman weds out\r\nof inclination, but there is no lack of causes to disturb his marriage.\r\nA rich blessing of children brings on cares and troubles; but too often\r\nwant sets in. Sickness and death are frequent guests in the workingman's\r\nfamily. Lack of work drives misery to its height. Many a circumstance\r\npares off the worker's earnings, or temporarily robs him wholly of it.\r\nCommercial and industrial crises throw him out of work; the introduction\r\nof new machinery, or methods of work, casts him as superfluous on the\r\nsidewalk; wars, unfavorable tariffs and commercial treaties, the\r\nintroduction of the new indirect taxes, disciplinary acts on the part of\r\nthe employer in punishment for the exercise of his convictions, etc.,\r\ndestroy his existence, or seriously injure it. Now one thing, then\r\nanother happens, whereby, sometimes for a shorter, sometimes for a\r\nlonger period, he becomes an unemployed, i. e., a starving being.\r\nUncertainty is the badge of his existence. When such blows of fortune\r\nhappen, they at first produce dissatisfaction and bitterness, and in the\r\nhome life this mood finds its first expression when daily, every hour,\r\ndemands are made by wife and children for the most pressing needs, needs\r\nthat the husband can not satisfy. Out of despair, he visits the saloon,\r\nand seeks comfort in bad liquor. The last penny is spent. Quarrel and\r\ndissension break out. The ruin of both marriage and the family is\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nLet us take up another picture. Both--husband and wife--go to work. The\r\nlittle ones are left to themselves, or to the care of older brothers and\r\nsisters, themselves in need of care and education. At noon, the\r\nso-called lunch is swallowed down in hot haste,--supposing that the\r\nparents have at all time to rush home, which, in thousands of cases is\r\nimpossible, owing to the shortness of the hour of recess, and the\r\ndistance of the shop from the home. Tired out and unstrung, both return\r\nhome in the evening. Instead of a friendly, cheerful home, they find a\r\nnarrow, unhealthy habitation, often lacking in light and air, generally\r\nalso in the most necessary comforts. The increasing tenement plague,\r\ntogether with the horrible improprieties that flow therefrom, is one of\r\nthe darkest sides of our social order, and leads to numerous evils,\r\nvices and crimes. Yet the plague increases from year to year in all\r\ncities and industrial regions, and it draws within the vortex of its\r\nevils ever new strata of society: small producers, public employes,\r\nteachers, small traders, etc. The workingman's wife, who reaches home in\r\nthe evening tired and harassed, has now again her hands full. She must\r\nbestir herself at breakneck speed in order but to get ready the most\r\nnecessary things in the household. The crying and noisy children are\r\nhurried off to bed; the wife sits up, and sews, and patches deep into\r\nthe night. The so-much-needed mental intercourse and encouragement are\r\nabsent. The husband is often uneducated and knows little, the wife still\r\nless; the little they have to say to each other is soon got through\r\nwith. The husband goes to the saloon, and seeks there the entertainment\r\nthat he lacks at home; he drinks; however little that be that he spends,\r\nfor his means it is too much. At times he falls a prey to gambling,\r\nwhich, in the upper circles of society also, claims many victims, and he\r\nloses more than he spends in drink. The wife, in the meantime, sits at\r\nhome and grumbles; she must work like a dray-horse; for her there is no\r\nrest or recreation; the husband avails himself of the freedom that\r\naccident gives him, of having been born a man. Thus disharmony arises.\r\nIf, however, the wife is less true to duty, she seeks in the evening,\r\nafter she has returned home tired, the rest she is entitled to; but then\r\nthe household goes back, and misery is twice as great. Indeed, we live\r\n\"in the best world possible.\"\r\n\r\nThrough these and similar circumstances, marriage is shattered ever\r\nmore among the working class also. Even favorable seasons of work exert\r\ntheir destructive influence: they compel him to work Sundays and\r\novertime: they take from him the hours he still had left for his family.\r\nIn many instances he has to travel hours to reach the shop; to utilize\r\nthe noon recess for going home is an impossibility; he is up in the\r\nmorning at the very earliest, when the children are still sound asleep,\r\nand returns home late, when they are again in the same condition.\r\nThousands, especially those engaged in the building trades in the\r\ncities, remain away from home all week, owing to the vastness of the\r\ndistance, and return only on Saturdays to their family. And yet it is\r\nexpected of family life that it thrive under such circumstances.\r\nMoreover, female labor is ever on the increase, especially in the\r\ntextile industry, whose thousands of steam weaving and spinning looms\r\nare served by cheap woman and children's hands. Here the relations of\r\nsex and age have been reversed. Wife and child go into the mill, the now\r\nbreadless husband sits at home and attends to household duties. In the\r\nUnited States, that, due to its rapid large-capitalist development,\r\nproduces all the evils of European industrial States in much larger\r\ndimensions, a characteristic name has been invented for the state of\r\nthings brought on by such conditions. Industrial places that employ\r\nwomen mainly, while the husbands sit at home, are called \"she-towns.\"\r\n\r\nThe admission of women to all the manual trades is to-day conceded on\r\nall hands. Capitalist society, ever on the hunt for profit and gain, has\r\nlong since recognized what an excellent subject for exploitation is\r\nwoman--more docile and submissive, and less exacting woman--in\r\ncomparison with man. Hence the number of trades and occupations, in\r\nwhich women are finding employment increases yearly. The extension and\r\nimprovement of machinery, the simplification of the process of\r\nproduction through the ever minuter subdivision of labor, the intenser\r\ncompetition of capitalists among themselves, together with the\r\ncompetitive battle in the world's market among rival industrial\r\ncountries,--all these continue to favor the ever further application of\r\nfemale labor. It is a phenomenon noticeable in all industrial countries\r\nalike. But in the same measure that the number of working-women\r\nincreases, competition among the workingmen is thereby intensified. One\r\nbranch of industry after another, one branch of work after the other, is\r\nbeing taken by working-women, who are ever more displacing the men.\r\nNumerous passages in the reports of factory inspectors, as well as in\r\nthe statistical figures on the occupation of working-women, go to\r\nconfirm the fact.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the women is worst in the industrial branches in which\r\nthey preponderate, for instance, the clothing and underwear industry,\r\nthose branches, in general, in which work can be done at home. The\r\ninquiry into the condition of the working-women in the underwear and\r\nconfectionery industries, ordered in 1886 by the Bundesrath, has\r\nrevealed the fact that the wages of these working-women are often so\r\nmiserable that they are compelled to prostitute their bodies for a\r\nside-source of income. A large number of the prostitutes are recruited\r\nfrom the strata of ill-paid working-women.\r\n\r\nOur \"Christian\" Government, whose Christianity, as a rule, is looked for\r\nin vain there where it should be applied, and is found where the same is\r\nsuperfluous and harmful,--this Christian Government acts exactly like\r\nthe Christian capitalists, a fact that does not astonish him who knows\r\nthat the Christian Government is but the agent of our Christian\r\ncapitalists. The Government only with difficulty decides in favor of\r\nlaws to limit woman-labor to a normal measure, or to wholly forbid\r\nchild-labor;--on the same principle that that Government denies many of\r\nits own employes both the requisite Sunday rest and normal hours of\r\nwork, and in that way materially disturbs their family life. Post\r\nOffice, railroad, penitentiary and other Government employes often must\r\nperform their functions far beyond the time limit, and their salaries\r\nstand in inverse ratio to their work. That, however, is, to-day, the\r\nnormal condition of things, still considered quite in order by the\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nSeeing, furthermore, that rent, in comparison to the wages and earnings\r\nof the workingmen, the lower Government employes and the small men\r\nincluded, is much too high, these must exert themselves to the utmost.\r\nLodgers are taken into these homes, only males in some, females in\r\nothers, often both. The young and the old live together in narrow\r\nquarters, without separating the sexes, and are crowded together even\r\nduring the most private acts. How the sense of shame, or morality fares\r\nthereby, horrifying facts proclaim. The increasing brutalization of the\r\nyouth, so extensively discussed, is due mainly to the conditions\r\nprevalent in our industrial system, with which the wretchedness of the\r\nhome is closely connected. And, as to the children, what must be upon\r\nthem the effect of industrial labor! The very worst imaginable, both\r\nphysically and morally.\r\n\r\nThe ever increasing industrial occupation of married women also is\r\naccompanied with fatal results. Especially is this the case in\r\nconnection with pregnancy and child-birth, as also during the early life\r\nof the child when it depends upon the nourishment of the mother. A\r\nnumber of ailments arise during pregnancy that affect destructively both\r\nthe fruit and the organism of the woman, and cause premature and\r\nstill-born births, upon all of which more later. After the child is\r\nborn, the mother is compelled to return as quickly as possible to the\r\nfactory, lest her place be taken by a competitor. The inevitable\r\nresults to the little ones are: neglected care, improper or total lack\r\nof nourishment. They are drugged with opiates to keep them quiet. The\r\nfurther results are: a vast mortality, or stunted development; in short,\r\nthe degeneration of the race. The children often grow up without having\r\nenjoyed true motherly and fatherly love, or having on their part, felt\r\nfilial affection. Thus is the proletariat born, thus does it live and\r\ndie. And the \"Christian\" Government, this \"Christian\" society wonders\r\nthat rudeness, immorality and crime cumulate.\r\n\r\nWhen, in the early sixties of last century, due to the American Civil\r\nWar for the emancipation of the negroes, many thousands of workingmen in\r\nthe English cotton industries were out of work, physicians made the\r\nremarkable discovery that, despite great want among the population,\r\nmortality among children had _declined_. The cause was simple. The\r\nchildren now enjoyed the mother's nourishment and better care than they\r\nhad ever had during the best seasons of work. The same fact was attested\r\nby physicians during the crisis of the seventies in the United States,\r\nespecially in New York and Massachusetts. The general lack of employment\r\ncompelled the women to rest from labor, and left them time for the care\r\nof their children. Similar observations were also made by Dr. v.\r\nRecherberg during the inquiry into the condition of the weavers of the\r\nregion of Zittau in Saxony, as shown by him in a work that he wrote\r\nduring the summer of 1890.\r\n\r\nIn the home-industries, which romantic economists love to represent as\r\nidyllic, conditions are no better. Here the wife is chained to her\r\nhusband, at work early and late into the night, and the children are\r\nfrom an early age hitched on. Crowded into the narrowest space\r\nimaginable, husband, wife and family, boys and girls, live together,\r\nalong with the waste of materials, amidst the most disagreeable dusts\r\nand odors, and without the necessary cleanliness. The bedrooms are of a\r\npiece with the sitting and working rooms: generally dark holes and\r\nwithout ventilation, they would be sufficiently unsanitary if they\r\nhoused but a part of the people huddled into them. In short, the\r\nconditions of these places are such as to cause the skin to creep of\r\nanyone accustomed to a life worthy of a human being.\r\n\r\nThe ever harder struggle for existence often also compels women and men\r\nto commit actions and tolerate indignities that, under other\r\ncircumstances, would fill them with disgust. In 1877 it was\r\nauthentically established in Munich that, among the prostitutes,\r\nregistered by and under the surveillance of the police, there were not\r\nless than 203 wives of workingmen and artisans. And how many are not the\r\nmarried women, who, out of distress, prostitute themselves without\r\nsubmitting to a police control that deeply lacerates the sense of shame\r\nand dignity!\r\n\r\nBut we have wandered somewhat from our subject. It was shown that the\r\nnumber of actions for divorce is on the increase in all countries of\r\ncivilization, and that the majority of these actions proceed from wives.\r\nThis steadily rising figure of actions for divorce is a sign of _the\r\ndecay of bourgeois marriage, which is answering its purpose ever less_.\r\nBut a still much worse sign of its decay is the circumstance that,\r\nsimultaneously, the number of marriages is in almost all these countries\r\nsteadily on the decline. Experience tells that high prices for corn in\r\none single year have an unfavorable effect both upon the number of\r\nmarriages and that of births. Long industrial crises, and increasing\r\ndeterioration of the general economic condition must, accordingly, have\r\na lasting evil effect. This is confirmed by the statistics of marriages\r\nfor almost all countries in civilization.\r\n\r\nIn France, marriages between 1881-1890 cast the following picture on the\r\ncanvas. Marriages were contracted in--\r\n\r\n\r\n    1881  282,079     1886  283,208\r\n    1882  281,060     1887  277,060\r\n    1883  284,519     1888  276,848\r\n    1884  289,555     1889  272,934\r\n    1885  283,170     1890  269,332\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is, accordingly, a considerable decrease of marriages.\r\n\r\nIn the German Empire, the number of marriages was highest after the\r\nclose of the war between Germany and France, during which they had stood\r\nstill. In 1872 there were 423,900 marriages contracted, but in 1876 they\r\nnumbered only 366,912, and during the worst year of the crisis, the year\r\n1879, they dropped to 335,113. They have since risen again slowly, and\r\nnumbered in\r\n\r\n\r\n    1882  350,457     1889  389,339\r\n    1886  372,326     1892  398,775\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough in the year 1892 the population of Germany was larger by\r\n8,000,000 heads than in 1872, the number of marriages was not even as\r\nlarge as in 1874 when it amounted to 400,282. In the period between\r\n1871-1880, there were, to an average of 1,000 inhabitants in Germany,\r\n8.6 marriages; in the period between 1881-1888, only 7.8.\r\n\r\nIn Prussia, to the average 10,000 inhabitants, there married--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Between 1831-35   1,849\r\n    Between 1866-70   1,605\r\n    Between 1871-75   1,896\r\n    Between 1881-85   1,529\r\n    And in 1888       1,624\r\n\r\n\r\nA similar, partly even more unfavorable picture than in Germany, is\r\nfurnished by the statistical tables for other European countries.\r\n\r\nOut of every 10,000 persons, there married--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Year    Holland Switzerland Austria France Italy Belgium England\r\n    1873      171       152       188     178   159    156     176\r\n    1874      168       166       181     167   153    152     170\r\n    1875      167       179       171     164   168    145     167\r\n    1876      165       162       165     158   163    142     166\r\n    1877      162       157       150     150   154    149     157\r\n    1878      155       147       152     151   142    135     152\r\n    1879      153       138       155     152   150    136     144\r\n    1880      150       137       152     149   140    141     149\r\n    1881      146       136       160     150   162    142     151\r\n    1882      143       135       164     149   157    140     155\r\n    1883      142       136       157     150   161    136     154\r\n    1884      144       136       157     153   164    136     151\r\n    1885      139       138       152     149   158    136     144\r\n    1886      139       137       155     149   158    134     141\r\n              ---       ---       ---     ---   ---    ---     ---\r\n    Average   153       147       161     155   156    141     156\r\n\r\n    Year     Scotland Ireland Denmark Norway Sweden Hungary\r\n    1873        155      96     162     145    146    226\r\n    1874        152      92     164     153    145    214\r\n    1875        148      91     170     157    140    218\r\n    1876        150      99     171     154    141    198\r\n    1877        144      93     161     151    137    182\r\n    1878        134      95     148     146    129    187\r\n    1879        128      87     147     135    126    205\r\n    1880        132      78     152     133    126    182\r\n    1881        139      85     156     128    124    198\r\n    1882        140      86     154     134    127    203\r\n    1883        140      85     154     132    128    205\r\n    1884        135      91     156     137    131    201\r\n    1885        129      86     151     133    133    ...\r\n    1886        124      84     142     131    ...    ...\r\n                ---      --     ---     ---    ---    ---\r\n    Average     139      89     156     141    133    202\r\n\r\n\r\nThese figures are interesting in more respects than one. In the first\r\nplace, they prove that, in all the countries named, the number of\r\nmarriages _declines_. Like Germany, all these countries show the highest\r\nfrequency of marriage in the beginning of 1872, and then follows a drop\r\nin most of them. Hungary comes out best; Ireland, on the contrary,\r\nworst, showing the smallest figures of all. The ejectment of the Irish\r\npopulation from their lands, and the ever greater concentration of the\r\nsame in the hands of the large landlords, express themselves clearly in\r\nthe figures given.[79]\r\n\r\nIndustrial conditions have a marked effect upon the number of marriages.\r\nAs the former has, on an average, become ever more unfavorable since the\r\nmiddle of the seventies, the decline in marriages is not astonishing.\r\nBut not the industrial conditions only, also the manner in which the\r\nproperty relations develop affects marriages in a high degree, as just\r\nseen in Ireland. The Year-Book of Schmoller for 1885, section 1, gives\r\ninformation on the statistics of population of the Kingdom of\r\nWuertemberg, from which it appears strikingly that with the increase of\r\nlarge age _declines_, while the number of _unmarried_ men between the\r\nages of 40 and 50 _rises_:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     Percentage of Males.\r\n                              Percentage of Landed    Married   Unmarried\r\n                                Property by           of the    of the\r\n                                 Hectares.

Large landed property, on the contrary, works directly\r\nagainst marriage, and promotes celibacy. All the figures here quoted\r\nprove, accordingly, that, not _morals_, but purely _material_ causes are\r\nthe determining factor. _The number of marriages, like the moral\r\nconditions of a commonwealth, depends upon its material foundations._\r\n\r\nThe fear of want, the mental worry lest the children be not educated up\r\nto their station,--these are further causes that drive the wives, in\r\nparticular, of all ranks to actions that are out of keeping with nature,\r\nand still more so with the criminal code. Under this head belong the\r\nvarious means for the prevention of pregnancy, or, when, despite all\r\ncare, this does set in, then the removal of the unripe\r\nfruit--_abortion_. It were an error to claim that these measures are\r\nresorted to only by heedless, unconscionable women. Often, rather, it is\r\nconscientious women, who wish to limit the number of children, in order\r\nto escape the dilemma of either having to deny themselves their\r\nhusbands, or of driving them to paths that they are naturally inclined\r\nto. It often is such women who prefer to undergo the dangers of\r\nabortion. Besides these, there are other women, especially in the higher\r\nwalks of life, who, in order to conceal a \"slip,\" or out of aversion\r\nfor the inconveniences of pregnancy, of child-birth and of nursing,\r\nperhaps, out of fear of sooner losing their charms, and then forfeiting\r\ntheir standing with either husband or male friends, incur such criminal\r\nacts, and, for hard cash, find ready medical and midwife support.\r\n\r\nTo conclude from diverse indications, artificial abortion is coming ever\r\nmore into practice; nor is the practice new. Artificial abortion was in\r\nfrequent use among the ancient peoples, and is, to this day, from the\r\nmost civilized down to the barbarous. According to Jules Roget,[80] the\r\nwomen of Rome took recourse to abortion for several reasons: They either\r\nsought to destroy the evidence of illicit relations--a reason that even\r\nto-day is often at its bottom; or they wished to be able to indulge\r\ntheir excesses without interruption. There were also other reasons: they\r\nwished to avoid the changes that pregnancy and child-birth work upon\r\nwoman's physique. Among the Romans, a woman was old from twenty-five\r\nyears to thirty. Accordingly, she sought to avoid all that might impair\r\nher charms. In the Middle Ages, abortion was punishable with severe\r\nbodily chastisement, often even with death; the free woman, guilty\r\nthereof, became a serf. At present, abortion is especially in use in the\r\nUnited States. In all large cities of the Union, there are institutions\r\nin which girls and women are prematurely delivered: many American papers\r\ncontain the advertisements of such places: abortion is talked of there\r\nalmost as freely as of a regular birth. In Germany and Europe, opinion\r\non the subject is different: the German criminal code, for instance,\r\nmakes the act of both the principal and the accessory a penitentiary\r\noffense.[81]\r\n\r\nAbortion is, in many cases, accompanied by the most serious results. The\r\noperation is dangerous; death not infrequently occurs; often the result\r\nis a permanent impairment of health. \"The troubles of troublesome\r\npregnancy and child-birth are infinitely less than the sufferings\r\nconsequent upon artificial abortion.\"[82] Barrenness is one of its most\r\ncommon consequences. All that, notwithstanding, abortion is practiced\r\nalso in Germany, ever more frequently, and for the reasons given.\r\nBetween 1882-1888, the number of cases in Berlin, of which the criminal\r\ncourts took cognizance, rose 155 per cent. The _chronique scandaleuse_\r\nof the last years dealt frequently with cases of abortion, that caused\r\ngreat sensation, due to the circumstance that reputable physicians and\r\nwomen, prominent in society, played a _role_ in them. Furthermore, to\r\njudge from the rising number of announcements in our newspapers, the\r\ninstitutions and places increase in which married and unmarried women of\r\nthe property class are offered an opportunity to await the results of a\r\n\"slip\" in perfect secrecy.\r\n\r\nThe dread of a large increase of children--due to the smallness of\r\nmeans, and the cost of bringing up--has, among all classes and even\r\npeoples, developed the use of preventatives into a system, that here and\r\nyonder has grown into a public calamity. It is a generally known fact\r\nthat, in all strata of French society, the \"two-child system\" is in\r\nforce. In few countries of civilization are marriages relatively as\r\nnumerous as in France, and in no country is the average number of\r\nchildren so small, and the increase of population so slow. The French\r\ncapitalist, like the small-holder and allotment peasant, pursues the\r\nsystem; the French workingman follows suit. In many sections of Germany\r\nthe special situation of the peasants seems to have led to similar\r\nconditions. We know a charming region in Southwest Germany, where, in\r\nthe garden of every peasant, there stands the so-called \"Sevenbaum,\"\r\nwhose properties are applied to abortive purposes. In another district\r\nof the same country the regular two-child system prevails among the\r\npeasants: they do not wish to divide the places. Moreover, striking is\r\nthe measure in which literature, that treats with and recommends the\r\nmeans of \"facultative sterility,\" increases in Germany both in volume\r\nand demand,--of course, always under the colors of science, and in\r\nallusion to the alleged threatening danger of over-population.\r\n\r\nAlong with abortion and the artificial prevention of conception, crime\r\nplays its _role_. In France, the murder of children and their exposure\r\nis perceptibly on the increase, both promoted by the provision of the\r\nFrench civil code that forbids all inquiry after the paternity of the\r\nchild. Section 340 of the _Code Civil_ decrees: \"_La recherche de la\r\npaternite est interdite_;\" on the other hand, Section 314 provides: \"_La\r\nrecherche de la maternite est admise_.\" To inquire after the paternity\r\nof a child is forbidden, but is allowed after its maternity,--a law that\r\nglaringly brings out the injustice contemplated towards the seduced\r\nwoman. The men of France are free to seduce as many women and girls as\r\nthey are able to; they are free from all responsibility; they owe no\r\nsupport to the child. These provisions were instituted under the pretext\r\nthat the female sex should be frightened against seducing the men. As\r\nyou see, everywhere it is the weak man, this limb of the stronger sex,\r\nwho is seduced, but never seduces. The result of Section 340 of the\r\n_Code Civil_ was Section 312, which provides: \"_L'enfant conçu pendant\r\nle marriage a pour pere le mari._\"[83] Inquiry after the paternity being\r\nforbidden, it is logical that the husband, crowned with horns, rest\r\ncontent with having the child, that his wife received from another,\r\nconsidered his own. Inconsistency, at any rate, can not be charged to\r\nthe French capitalist class. All attempts to amend Section 340 have so\r\nfar failed. Lately, February, 1895, the Socialist deputies in the French\r\nChamber of Deputies presented a bill intended to put an end to the\r\ndisfranchised position of the seduced or betrayed woman. Whether the\r\nattempt will be crowned with success is doubtful.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the French capitalist class--sensible of the cruelty\r\nit committed in so framing the law as to make it impossible for the\r\ndeceived woman to turn for support to the father of her child--sought to\r\nmake up for its sins by establishing foundling asylums. According to our\r\nfamous \"morals,\" there is no paternal feeling towards the illegitimate\r\nchild; that exists only for \"legitimate heirs.\" Through the foundlings'\r\nasylums the mother also is taken from the new-born child. According to\r\nthe French fiction, foundlings are orphans. In this way, the French\r\ncapitalist class has its illegitimate children brought up, _at the\r\nexpense of the State_, as \"children of the fatherland.\" A charming\r\narrangement. In Germany, things bid fair to be switched on the French\r\ntrack. The provisions in the bill for a civil code for the German Empire\r\ncontain maxims on the legal status of illegitimate children, strongly in\r\ncontrast with the humane law still in force.\r\n\r\nAccording to the bill, a dishonored girl--even if blameless, or seduced\r\nwith the promise of subsequent marriage, or induced to consent to\r\ncoition through some criminal act--has no claim against the seducer\r\nexcept as indemnity for the costs of delivery, and for support during\r\nthe first six weeks after the birth of the child, and then only within\r\nthe bounds of what is strictly necessary. Only in some of the cases of\r\nthe worst crimes against morality, can a slight money indemnity be\r\ngranted to the seduced girl, at the discretion of the court, and without\r\nthe necessity of proving actual damages. The illegitimate child has no\r\nclaim upon the seducer of his mother, except for the merest necessaries\r\nof life, and then only until its fourteenth year. All claims of the\r\nchild on its father are, however, barred if, within pregnancy, any other\r\nman cohabit with its mother. The plaintiff child has, moreover, to prove\r\nthat its mother has not accepted the embraces of any other man.\r\n\r\nMenger, the expositions in whose treatise[84] we here follow, justly\r\nraises against the bill the serious charge that it only accrues to the\r\nadvantage of the well-to-do, immoral men, seducers of ignorant girls,\r\noften girls who sin through poverty, but leaves these fallen girls,\r\ntogether with their wholly guiltless children, entirely unprotected,\r\naye, pushes them only deeper into misery and crime. Menger cites, in\r\nthis connection, the provisions of the Prussian law. According thereto,\r\nan unmarried woman or widow of good character, who is made pregnant, is\r\nto be indemnified by the man according to his means. The indemnity\r\nshall, however, not exceed one-fourth of his property. An illegitimate\r\nchild has a claim upon its father for support and education, regardless\r\nof whether his mother is a person of good character: the expenditure,\r\nhowever, shall be no higher than the education of a legitimate child\r\nwould cost to people of the peasant or of ordinary citizen walks of\r\nlife. If the illicit intercourse occurred under promise of future\r\nmarriage, then, according to the further provisions of Prussian law, the\r\nJudge is duly to award the woman, pronounced innocent and a wife, the\r\nname, standing and rank of the man, together with all the rights of a\r\ndivorced woman. The illegitimate child has, in such cases, all the\r\nrights of children born in wedlock. We may await with curiosity to see\r\nwhether the provisions of this bill, so hostile to woman, will acquire\r\nthe force of a civil code of law in Germany. But retrogression is the\r\nkey-note in our legislation.\r\n\r\nBetween the years of 1830-1880, there were 8,563 cases of infanticide\r\nbefore the French court of assizes, the figures rising from 471 in 1831,\r\nto 980 in 1880. During the same period, 1,032 cases of abortion were\r\ntried, 41 in 1831, and in 1880 over 100. Of course, only a small part of\r\nthe abortions came to the knowledge of the criminal court; as a rule,\r\nonly when followed by serious illness or death. In the cases of\r\ninfanticide, the country population contributed 75 per cent., in the\r\ncases of abortion the cities 65 per cent. In the city, the women have\r\nmore means at command to prevent normal birth; hence, the many cases of\r\nabortion and the small number of infanticides. It is the reverse in the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nSuch is the composition of the picture presented by modern society in\r\nrespect to its most intimate relations. The picture differs wide from\r\nthat that poets and poetically doused phantasists love to paint it. Our\r\npicture, however, has this advantage,--it is true. And yet the picture\r\nstill calls for several strokes of the brush to bring out its character\r\nin full.\r\n\r\nIn general, there can be no difference of opinion touching the present\r\nand average mental inferiority of the female sex to the male. True\r\nenough, Balzac, by no means a woman-lover, claims: \"The woman, who has\r\nreceived a male education, possesses in fact the most brilliant and\r\nfruitful qualities for the building of her own happiness and that of her\r\nhusband;\" and Goethe, who knew well both the men and women of his times,\r\nexpresses himself in Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship (confessions of a\r\npure soul): \"Learned women were ridiculed, and also the educated ones\r\nwere disliked, probably because it was considered impolite to put so\r\nmany ignorant men to shame.\" We agree with both. Nevertheless, the fact\r\nis no wise altered that, in general, women stand intellectually behind\r\nthe men. This difference is compulsory, because _woman is that which\r\nman, as her master, has made her_. The education of woman, more so than\r\nthat of the working class, has been neglected since time immemorial; nor\r\nare latter-day improvements adequate. We live in days when the\r\naspiration after exchange of thought grows in all circles, in the family\r\nalso; and there the neglected education of woman is felt as a serious\r\nfault, and it avenges itself upon the husband.\r\n\r\nThe object of the education of man--at least it is so claimed, although\r\ndue to the mistaken methods, the object is often missed, perchance,\r\nalso, is not meant to be reached--aims at the development of the\r\nintellect, the sharpening of the powers of thought, the broadening of\r\nthe field of practical knowledge, and the invigoration of the\r\nwill-power, in short, at the cultivation of the functions of the mind.\r\nWith woman, on the contrary, education, so far as at all attended to in\r\na higher degree, is mainly aimed at the intensification of her feelings,\r\nat formality and polite culture--music, belles-letters, art, poetry--all\r\nof which only screw her nervous sensitiveness and phantasy up to a\r\nhigher pitch. This is a mistaken and unhealthy policy. In it the fact\r\ntranspires that the powers, which determine the measure of woman's\r\neducation, are guided only by their ingrained prejudices regarding the\r\nnature of the female character, and also by the cramped position of\r\nwoman. The object must not be to develop still further the sentimental\r\nand imaginative side of woman, which would only tend to heighten her\r\nnatural inclination to nervousness; neither should her education be\r\nlimited to etiquette and polite literature. The object, with regard to\r\nher as to man, should be to develop their intellectual activity and\r\nacquaint them with the phenomena of practical life. It would be of\r\ngreatest benefit to both sexes if, in lieu of a superfluity of\r\nsentiment, that often becomes positively uncanny, woman possessed a good\r\nshare of sharpened wit and power for exact reasoning; if, in lieu of\r\nexcessive nervous excitation and timidity, she possessed firmness of\r\ncharacter and physical courage; in lieu of conventional, literary\r\nrefinement, in so far as she at all has any, she had a knowledge of the\r\nworld, of men and of the powers of Nature.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, what is termed the feeling and spirituality of woman\r\nhas hitherto been nurtured without stint, while her intellectual\r\ndevelopment has, on the contrary, been grossly neglected and kept\r\nunder. As a consequence, she suffers of hypertrophy of feeling and\r\nspirituality, hence is prone to superstition and miracles,--a more than\r\ngrateful soil for religious and other charlataneries, a pliant tool for\r\nall reaction. Blockish men often complain when she is thus affected, but\r\nthey bring no relief, because often they are themselves steeped up to\r\nthe ears in prejudices.\r\n\r\nBy reason of woman's being almost generally as here sketched, she looks\r\nupon the world differently from man. Hence, again, a strong source of\r\ncontrariety between the two sexes.\r\n\r\nParticipation in public life is to-day one of the most essential duties\r\nof a man; that many men do not yet understand this does not alter the\r\nfact. Nevertheless, the number of those is ever increasing who realize\r\nthat public institutions stand in intimate connection with the private\r\nlot of the individual; that his success or failure, together with that\r\nof his family, depend infinitely more upon the condition of public\r\naffairs than upon his own personal qualities and actions. The fact is\r\nbeginning to receive recognition that the greatest efforts of the\r\nindividual are powerless against evils that lie in the very condition of\r\nthings, and that determine his state. On the other hand, the struggle\r\nfor existence now requires much greater efforts than before. Demands are\r\nnow made upon man that engage ever more his time and strength. The\r\nignorant, indifferent wife stands dumb before him, and feels herself\r\nneglected. It may be even said that, the mental difference between man\r\nand woman is to-day greater than formerly, when the opportunities for\r\nboth were slight and limited, and lay more within the reach of her\r\nrestricted intellect. Furthermore, the handling of public affairs\r\noccupies to-day a large number of men to a degree before unknown; this\r\nwidens their horizon; but it also withdraws them ever more from the\r\nmental sphere of their homes. The wife deems herself set back, and thus\r\nanother source of friction is started. Only rarely does the husband know\r\nhow to pacify his wife and convince her. When he does that, he has\r\nescaped a dangerous rock. As a rule the husband is of the opinion that\r\nwhat he wants does not concern his wife, she does not understand it. He\r\ntakes no pains to enlighten her. \"You don't understand such matters,\" is\r\nhis stereotyped answer, the moment the wife complains that she is\r\nneglected. Lack of information on the part of wives is promoted by lack\r\nof sense on the part of most husbands. More favorable relations between\r\nhusband and wife spring up in the rank of the working class in the\r\nmeasure that both realize they are tugging at the same rope, and that\r\nthere is but one means towards satisfactory conditions for themselves\r\nand their family,--the radical reformation of society that shall make\r\nhuman beings of them all. In the measure that such insight gains ground\r\namong the wives of the proletariat, then, despite want and misery,\r\ntheir married life is _idealized_: both now have a common aim, after\r\nwhich they strive; and they have an inexhaustible source of mutual\r\nencouragement in the mutual interchange of views, whereto their joint\r\nbattle leads them. The number of proletarian women who reach this\r\ninsight is every year larger. Herein lies a movement, that is in process\r\nof development, and that is fraught with decisive significance for the\r\nfuture of mankind.\r\n\r\nIn other social strata, the differences in education and views--easily\r\noverlooked at the beginning of married life, when passion still\r\npredominates--are felt ever more with ripening years. Sexual passion\r\ncools off, and its substitution with harmony of thought is all the more\r\nneedful. But, leaving aside whether the husband has any idea of civic\r\nduties and attends to the same, he, at any rate, thanks to his\r\noccupation and constant intercourse with the outer world, comes into\r\ncontinuous touch with different elements and opinions, on all sorts of\r\noccasions, and thus floats into an intellectual atmosphere that broadens\r\nhis horizon. As a rule, and in contrast with his wife, he finds himself\r\nin a state of intellectual molting, while she, on the contrary, due to\r\nher household duties, which engage her early and late, is robbed of\r\nleisure for further education, and, accordingly, becomes mentally\r\nstunted and soured.\r\n\r\nThe domestic wretchedness in which the majority of wives live to-day, is\r\ncorrectly depicted by the bourgeois-minded Gerhard von Amyntor in his\r\n\"Marginal Notes to the Book of Life.\"[85] In the chapter entitled\r\n\"Deadly Gnat-bites\" he says among other things:\r\n\r\n\"Not the shocking events, that none remain unvisited by, and that bring,\r\nhere the death of a husband, yonder the moral downfall of a beloved\r\nchild; that lie, here in a long and serious illness, yonder in the\r\nwrecking of a warmly nursed plan;--not these undermine her (the\r\nhousewife's) freshness and strength. It is the small, daily-recurring\r\nmarrow and bone-gnawing cares.... How many millions of brave little\r\nhouse-mothers cook and scour away their vigor of life, their very cheeks\r\nand roguish dimples, in attending to domestic cares until they become\r\ncrumpled, dried and broke-up mummies. The ever-recurring question, what\r\nshall be cooked to-day? the ever-recurring necessity of sweeping, and\r\nbeating, and brushing, and dusting is the continuously falling drop that\r\nslowly, but surely, wears away mind and body. The kitchen-hearth is the\r\nplace where the saddest balances are drawn up between income and\r\nexpense, where the most depressing observations are forced upon the mind\r\non the rising dearness of the necessaries of life, and on the ever\r\nincreasing difficulty to earn the needed cash. On the flaming altar,\r\nwhere the soup kettle bubbles, youth and mental ease, beauty and good\r\nhumor are sacrificed; and who recognizes in the old care-bent cook, the\r\none-time blooming, overbearing, coy-coquette bride in the array of her\r\nmyrtle crown? Already in antiquity the hearth was sacred, near it were\r\nplaced the Lares and patron deities. Let us also hold sacred the hearth\r\nat which the dutiful German bourgeois house-wife dies a slow death, in\r\norder to keep the house comfortable, the table covered and the family in\r\nhealth.\" Such is the consolation offered in bourgeois society to the\r\nwife, who, under the present order of society, is miserably going to\r\npieces.\r\n\r\nThose women, who, thanks to their social condition, find themselves in a\r\nfreer state, have, as a rule, a one-sided, superficial education, that,\r\ncombined with inherited female characteristics, manifests itself with\r\nforce. They generally have a taste for mere superficialities; they think\r\nonly about gew-gaws and dress; and thus they seek their mission in the\r\nsatisfaction of a spoiled taste, and the indulgence of passions that\r\ndemand their pay with usury. In their children and the education of\r\nthese they have hardly any interest: they give them too much trouble and\r\nannoyance, hence are left to the nurses and servants, and are later\r\npassed on to the boarding-schools. At any rate their principal task is\r\nto raise their daughters as show-dolls, and their sons as pupils for the\r\n_jeunesse dore_ (gilded youth) out of which dudedom recruits its\r\nranks--that despicable class of men that may be fairly put upon a level\r\nwith procurers. This _jeunesse dore_ furnishes the chief contingent to\r\nthe seducers of the daughters of the working class. They look upon\r\nidleness and squandering as a profession.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[58] Mainlaender, \"Philosophie der Erlösung,\" Frankfort-on-the-Main,\r\n1886, E. Koenitzer.\r\n\r\n[59] D. A.

On these features men love to dwell with\r\npredilection, but they forget that they are themselves the cause\r\nthereof, and have promoted with their conduct the defects they now make\r\nmerry about, or censure. Among these widely censured female qualities,\r\nbelong her dreaded readiness of tongue, and passion for gossip; her\r\ninclination to endless talk over trifles and unimportant things; her\r\nmental bent for purely external matters, such as dress, and her desire\r\nto please, together with a resulting proneness to all the follies of\r\nfashion; lastly, her easily arousable envy and jealousy of the other\r\nmembers of her sex.\r\n\r\nThese qualities, though in different degrees, manifest themselves\r\ngenerally in the female sex from early childhood. They are qualities\r\nthat are born under the pressure of social conditions, and are further\r\ndeveloped by heredity, example and education. A being irrationally\r\nbrought up, can not bring up others rationally.\r\n\r\nIn order to be clear on the causes and development of good or bad\r\nqualities, whether with the sexes or with whole peoples, the same\r\nmethods must be pursued that modern natural science applies in order to\r\nascertain the formation and development of life according to genus and\r\nspecies, and to determine their qualities. They are the laws that flow\r\nfrom the material conditions for life, laws that life demands, that\r\nadapt themselves to it, and finally became its nature.\r\n\r\nMan forms no exception to that which holds good in Nature for all\r\nanimate creation. Man does not stand outside of Nature: looked at\r\nphysiologically, he is the most highly developed animal,--a fact,\r\nhowever, that some would deny. Thousands of years ago, although wholly\r\nignorant of modern science, the ancients had on many matters affecting\r\nman, more rational views than the moderns; above all, they gave\r\npractical application to the views founded on experience. We praise with\r\nenthusiastic admiration the beauty and strength of the men and women of\r\nGreece; but the fact is overlooked that, not the happy climate, nor the\r\nbewitching nature of a territory that stretched along the bay-indented\r\nsea, but the physical culture and maxims of education, consistently\r\nenforced by the State, thus affected both the being and the development\r\nof the population. These measures were calculated to combine beauty,\r\nstrength and suppleness of body with wit and elasticity of mind, both of\r\nwhich were transmitted to the descendants. True enough, even then, in\r\ncomparison with man, woman was neglected in point of mental, but not of\r\ncorporal culture.[86] In Sparta, that went furthest in the corporal\r\nculture of the two sexes, boys and girls went naked until the age of\r\npuberty, and participated in common in the exercises of the body, in\r\ngames and in wrestling. The naked exposure of the human body, together\r\nwith the natural treatment of natural things, had the advantage that\r\nsensuous excitement--to-day artificially cultivated by the separation of\r\nthe sexes from early childhood--was then prevented. The corporal make-up\r\nof one sex, together with its distinctive organs, was no secret to the\r\nother. There, no play of equivocal words could arise. Nature was Nature.\r\nThe one sex rejoiced at the beauty of the other. Mankind will have to\r\nreturn to Nature and to the natural intercourse of the sexes; it must\r\ncast off the now-ruling and unhealthy spiritual notions concerning man;\r\nit must do that by setting up methods of education that fit in with our\r\nown state of culture, and that may bring on the physical and mental\r\nregeneration of the race.\r\n\r\nAmong us, and especially on the subject of female education, seriously\r\nerroneous conceptions are still prevalent. That woman also should have\r\nstrength, courage and resolution, is considered heretical, \"unwomanly,\"\r\nalthough none would dare deny that, equipped with such qualities, woman\r\ncould protect herself against many ills and inconveniences. Conversely,\r\nwoman is cramped in her physical, exactly as in her intellectual\r\ndevelopment. The irrationalness of her dress plays an important _role_\r\nherein. It not only, unconscionably hampers her in her physique, it\r\ndirectly ruins her;--and yet, but few physicians dare take a stand\r\nagainst the abuse, accurately informed though they are on the\r\ninjuriousness of her dress. The fear of displeasing the patient often\r\ncauses them to hold their tongues, if they do not even flatter her\r\ninsane notions. Modern dress hinders woman in the free use of her limbs,\r\nit injures her physical growth, and awakens in her a sense of impotence\r\nand weakness. Moreover, modern dress is a positive danger to her own and\r\nthe health of those who surround her: in the house and on the street,\r\nwoman is a walking raiser of dust. And likewise is the development of\r\nwoman hampered by the strict separation of the sexes, both in social\r\nintercourse and at school--a method of education wholly in keeping with\r\nthe spiritual ideas that Christianity has deeply implanted in us on all\r\nmatters that regard the nature of man.\r\n\r\nThe woman who does not reach the development of her faculties, who is\r\ncrippled in her powers, who is held imprisoned in the narrowest circle\r\nof thought, and who comes into contact with hardly any but her own\r\nfemale relatives,--such a woman can not possibly raise herself above the\r\nroutine of daily life and habits. Her intellectual horizon revolves only\r\naround the happenings in her own immediate surroundings, family affairs\r\nand what thereby hangs. Extensive conversations on utter trifles, the\r\nbent for gossip, are promoted with all might; of course her latent\r\nintellectual qualities strain after activity and exercise;--whereupon\r\nthe husband, often involved thereby in trouble, and driven to\r\ndesperation, utters imprecations upon qualities that he, the \"chief of\r\ncreation,\" has mainly upon his own conscience.\r\n\r\nWith woman--whose face all our social and sexual relations turn toward\r\nmarriage with every fibre of her being--marriage and matrimonial matters\r\nconstitute, quite naturally, a leading portion of her conversation and\r\naspirations. Moreover, to the physically weaker woman, subjected as she\r\nis to man by custom and laws, the tongue is her principal weapon against\r\nhim, and, as a matter of course, she makes use thereof. Similarly with\r\nregard to her severely censured passion for dress and desire to please,\r\nwhich reach their frightful acme in the insanities of fashion, and often\r\nthrow fathers and husbands into great straits and embarrassments. The\r\nexplanation lies at hand. To man, woman is, first of all, an object of\r\nenjoyment. Economically and socially unfree, she is bound to see in\r\nmarriage her means of support; accordingly, she depends upon man and\r\nbecomes a piece of property to him. As a rule, her position is rendered\r\nstill more unfavorable through the general excess of women over men,--a\r\nsubject that will be treated more closely. The disparity intensifies the\r\ncompetition of women among themselves; and it is sharpened still more\r\nbecause, for a great variety of reasons, a number of men do not marry at\r\nall. Woman is, accordingly, forced to enter into competition for a\r\nhusband with the members of her own sex, by means of the most favorable\r\nexternal presentation of her person possible.\r\n\r\nLet the long duration, through many generations, of these evils be taken\r\ninto account. The wonder will cease that these manifestations, sprung\r\nfrom equally lasting causes, have reached their present extreme form.\r\nFurthermore, perhaps in no age was the competition of women for husbands\r\nas sharp as it is in this, due partly to reasons already given, and\r\npartly to others yet to be discussed. Finally, the difficulties of\r\nobtaining a competent livelihood, as well as the demands made by\r\nsociety, combine, more than ever before, to turn woman's face towards\r\nmatrimony as an \"institute for support.\"\r\n\r\nMen gladly accept such a state of things: they are its beneficiaries. It\r\nflatters their pride, their vanity, their interest to play the _role_ of\r\nthe stronger and the master; and, like all other rulers, they are, in\r\ntheir _role_ of masters, difficult to reach by reason. It is, therefore,\r\nall the more in the interest of woman to warm towards the establishment\r\nof conditions that shall free her from so unworthy a position. Women\r\nshould expect as little help from the men as workingmen do from the\r\ncapitalist class.\r\n\r\nObserve the characteristics, developed in the struggle for the coveted\r\nplace, on other fields, on the industrial field, for instance, so soon\r\nas the capitalists face each other. What despicable, even scampish,\r\nmeans of warfare are not resorted to! What hatred, envy and passion for\r\ncalumny are not awakened!--observe that, and the explanation stands out\r\nwhy similar features turn up in the competition of women for a husband.\r\nHence it happens that women, on the average, do not get along among\r\nthemselves as well as men; that even the best female friends lightly\r\nfall out, if the question is their standing in a man's eye, or\r\npleasingness of appearance. Hence also the observation that wherever\r\nwomen meet, be they ever such utter strangers, they usually look at one\r\nanother as enemies. With one look they make the mutual discovery of\r\nill-matched colors, or wrongly-pinned bows, or any other similar\r\ncardinal sin. In the look that they greet each other with, the judgment\r\ncan be readily read that each has passed upon the other. It is as if\r\neach wished to inform the other: \"I know better than you how to dress,\r\nand draw attention upon myself.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, woman is by nature more impulsive than man; she\r\nreflects less than he; she has more abnegation, is naiver, and hence is\r\ngoverned by stronger passions, as revealed by the truly heroic\r\nself-sacrifice with which she protects her child, or cares for\r\nrelatives, and nurses them in sickness. In the fury, however, this\r\npassionateness finds its ugly expression. But the good as well as the\r\nbad sides, with man as well as woman, are influenced, first of all, by\r\ntheir social position; favored, or checked, or transfigured. The same\r\nimpulse, that, under unfavorable circumstances, appears as a blemish,\r\nis, under favorable circumstances, a source of happiness for oneself and\r\nothers. Fourier has the credit of having brilliantly demonstrated how\r\nthe identical impulses of man produce, under different conditions,\r\nwholly opposite results.\r\n\r\nRunning parallel with the effects of mistaken education, are the no less\r\nserious effects of mistaken or imperfect physical culture upon the\r\npurpose of Nature. All physicians are agreed that the preparation of\r\nwoman for her calling as mother and rearer of children leaves almost\r\neverything to be wished. \"Man exercises the soldier in the use of his\r\nweapons, and the artisan in the handling of his tools; every office\r\nrequires special studies; even the monk has his novitiate. Woman alone\r\nis not trained for her serious duties of mother.\"[87] Nine-tenths of the\r\nmaidens who marry enter matrimony with almost utter ignorance about\r\nmotherhood and the duties of wedlock. The inexcusable shyness, even on\r\nthe part of mothers, to speak with a grown-up daughter of such important\r\nsexual duties, leaves the latter in the greatest darkness touching her\r\nduties towards herself and her future husband. With her entrance upon\r\nmarried life, woman enters a territory that is wholly strange to her.\r\nShe has drawn to herself a fancy-picture thereof--generally from novels\r\nthat are not particularly to be commended--that does not accord with\r\nreality.[88] Her defective household knowledge, that, as things are\r\nto-day, is inevitable, even though many a function, formerly naturally\r\nbelonging to the wife, has been removed from her, also furnishes many a\r\ncause for friction. Some know nothing whatever of household matters:\r\nThey consider themselves too good to bother about them, and look upon\r\nthem as matters that concern the servant girl; numerous others, from the\r\nranks of the masses, are prevented, by the struggle for existence, from\r\ncultivating themselves for their calling as householders: they must be\r\nin the factory and at work early and late. It is becoming evident that,\r\ndue to the development of social conditions, the separate household\r\nsystem is losing ground every day; and that it can be kept up only at\r\nthe sacrifice of money and time, neither of which the great majority is\r\nable to expend.\r\n\r\nYet another cause that destroys the object of marriage to not a few men\r\nis to be found in the physical debility of many women. Our food,\r\nhousing, methods of work and support, in short, our whole form of life,\r\naffects us in more ways than one rather harmfully than otherwise. We can\r\nspeak with perfect right of a \"nervous age.\" Now, then, this nervousness\r\ngoes hand in hand with physical degeneration. Anaemia and nervousness\r\nare spread to an enormous degree among the female sex: They are assuming\r\nthe aspect of a social calamity, that, if it continue a few generations\r\nlonger, as at present, and we fail to place our social organization on a\r\nnormal footing, is urging the race towards its destruction.[89]\r\n\r\nWith an eye to its sexual mission, the female organism requires\r\nparticular care,--good food, and, at certain periods, the requisite\r\nrest. Both of these are lacking to the great majority of the female sex,\r\nat least in the cities and industrial neighborhoods, nor are they to be\r\nhad under modern industrial conditions. Moreover, woman has so\r\nhabituated herself to privation that, for instance, numberless women\r\nhold it a conjugal duty to keep the tid-bits for the man, and satisfy\r\nthemselves with insufficient nourishment. Likewise are boys frequently\r\ngiven the preference over girls in matters of food. The opinion is\r\ngeneral that woman can accommodate herself, not with less food only, but\r\nalso with food of poorer quality. Hence the sad picture that our female\r\nyouth, in particular, presents to the eyes of the expert. A large\r\nportion of our young women are bodily weak, anaemic, hypernervous. The\r\nconsequences are difficulties in menstruation, and disease of the organs\r\nconnected with the sexual purpose, the disease often assuming the\r\nmagnitude of incapacity to give birth and to nurse the child, even of\r\ndanger to life itself. \"Should this degeneration of our women continue\r\nto increase in the same measure as before, the time may not be far away\r\nwhen it will become doubtful whether man is to be counted among the\r\nmammals or not.\"[90] Instead of a healthy, joyful companion, of a\r\ncapable mother, of a wife attentive to her household duties, the husband\r\nhas on his hands a sick, nervous wife, whose house the physician never\r\nquits, who can stand no draught, and can not bear the least noise. We\r\nshall not expatiate further on this subject. Every reader--and as often\r\nas in this book we speak of \"reader,\" we mean, of course, the female as\r\nwell as the male--can himself further fill the picture: he has\r\nillustrations enough among his own relatives and acquaintances.\r\n\r\nExperienced physicians maintain that the larger part of married women,\r\nin the cities especially, are in a more or less abnormal condition.\r\nAccording to the degree of the evil and the character of the couple,\r\nsuch unions can not choose but be unhappy, and, they give the husband\r\nthe right, in public opinion, to allow himself freedoms outside of the\r\nmarriage bed, the knowledge of which throws the wife into the most\r\nwretched of moods. Furthermore the, at times, very different sexual\r\ndemands of one party or the other give occasion to serious friction,\r\nwithout the so much wished-for separation being possible. A great\r\nvariety of considerations render that, in most cases, out of all\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nUnder this head the fact may not be suppressed that a _considerable\r\nnumber of husbands are themselves responsible for certain serious\r\nphysical ailments of their wives, ailments that these are not\r\ninfrequently smitten with in marriage_. As consequences of the excesses\r\nindulged in during bachelorship, a considerable number of men suffer of\r\nchronic sexual diseases, which, seeing these cause them no serious\r\ninconvenience, are taken lightly. Nevertheless, through sexual\r\nintercourse with the wife, these diseases bring upon her disagreeable,\r\neven fatal troubles of the womb, that set in, soon after marriage, and\r\noften develop to the point of rendering her unable to conceive or to\r\ngive birth. The wretched woman usually has no idea of the cause of the\r\nsickness, that depresses her spirits, embitters her life, and uproots\r\nthe purpose of marriage. She blames herself, and accepts blame for a\r\ncondition, that the other party is alone responsible for. Thus many a\r\nblooming wife falls, barely married, a prey to chronic malady,\r\nunaccountable to either herself or her family.\r\n\r\n\"As recent investigations have proved, this circumstance--that, as a\r\nresult of gonorrhea, the male sperm no longer contains any seed-cells,\r\nand the man is, consequently, incapacitated for life from begetting\r\nchildren--_is a comparatively frequent cause of matrimonial barrenness,\r\nin contradiction to the old and convenient tradition of the lords of\r\ncreation, who are ever ready to shift to the shoulder of the wife the\r\nresponsibility for the absence of the blessing of children_.\"[91]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, a large number of causes are operative in preventing modern\r\nmarried life, in the large majority of instances, from being that which\r\nit should be:--a union of two beings of opposite sexes, who, out of\r\nmutual love and esteem, wish to belong to each other, and, in the\r\nstriking sentence of Kant, mean, jointly, to constitute the complete\r\nhuman being. It is, therefore, a suggestion of doubtful value--made even\r\nby learned folks, who imagine thereby to dispose of woman's endeavors\r\nafter emancipation--that she look to domestic duties, to marriage,--to\r\nmarriage, that our economic conditions are ever turning into a viler\r\ncaricature, and that answers its purpose ever less!\r\n\r\nThe advice to woman that she seek her salvation in marriage, this being\r\nher real calling,--an advice that is thoughtlessly applauded by the\r\nmajority of men--sounds like the merest mockery, when both the advisers\r\nand their _claqueurs_ do the opposite. Schopenhauer, the philosopher,\r\nhas of woman only the conception of the philistine. He says: \"Woman is\r\nnot meant for much work. Her characteristicon is not action but\r\n_suffering_. She pays the debt of life with the pains of travail,\r\nanxiety for the child, _subjection to man_. The strongest utterances of\r\nlife and sentiment are denied her. Her life is meant to be quieter and\r\nless important than man's. Woman is destined for nurse and educator of\r\ninfancy, _being herself infant-like, and an infant for life_, a sort of\r\nintermediate stage between the child and the man, _who is the real\r\nbeing_.... Girls should be trained for domesticity and _subjection....\r\nWomen are the most thorough-paced and incurable Philistines._\"\r\n\r\nIn the same spirit as Schopenhauer, who, of course, is greatly quoted,\r\nis cast Lombroso and Ferrerro's work, \"Woman as a Criminal and a\r\nProstitute.\" We know no scientific work of equal size--it contains 590\r\npages--with such a dearth of valid evidence on the theme therein\r\ntreated. The statistical matter, from which the bold conclusions are\r\ndrawn, is mostly meager. Often a dozen instances suffice the joint\r\nauthors to draw the weightiest deductions. The matter that may be\r\nconsidered the most valuable in the work is, typically enough, furnished\r\nby a woman,--Dr. Tarnowskaja. The influence of social conditions, of\r\ncultural development, is left almost wholly on one side. Everything is\r\njudged exclusively from the physiologico-psychologic view-point, while a\r\nlarge quantity of ethnographic items of information on various peoples\r\nis woven into the argument, without submitting these items to closer\r\nscrutiny. According to the authors, just as with Schopenhauer, woman is\r\na grown child, a liar _par excellence_, weak of judgment, fickle in\r\nlove, incapable of any deed truly heroic. They claim the inferiority of\r\nwoman to man is manifest from a large number of bodily differences.\r\n\"Love, with woman, is as a rule nothing but a secondary feature of\r\nmaternity,--all the feelings of attachment that bind woman to man arise,\r\nnot from sexual impulses, but from the instincts of subjection and\r\nresignation, acquired through habits of conformancy.\" How these\r\n\"instincts\" were acquired and \"conformed\" themselves, the joint authors\r\nfail to inquire into. They would then have had to inquire into the\r\nsocial position of woman in the course of thousands of years, and would\r\nhave been compelled to find that it is that that made her what she now\r\nis. It is true, the joint authors describe partly the enslaved and\r\ndependent position of woman among the several peoples and under the\r\nseveral periods of civilization; but as Darwinians, with blinkers to\r\ntheir eyes, they draw all that from physiologic and psychologic, not\r\nfrom social and economic reasons, which affected in strongest manner the\r\nphysiologic and psychologic development of woman.\r\n\r\nThe joint authors also touch upon the vanity of woman, and set up the\r\nopinion that, among the peoples who stand on a lower stage of\r\ncivilization, man is the vain sex, as is noticeable to-day in the New\r\nHebrides and Madagascar, among the peoples of the Orinoco, and on many\r\nislands of the Polynesian archipelago, as also among a number of African\r\npeoples of the South Sea. With peoples standing on a higher plane,\r\nhowever, woman is the vain sex. But why and wherefor? To us the answer\r\nseems plain. Among the peoples of a lower civilization, mother-right\r\nconditions prevail generally, or have not yet been long overcome. The\r\n_role_ that woman there plays raises her above the necessity of seeking\r\nfor the man, the man seeks her, and to this end, ornaments himself and\r\ngrows vain. With the people of a higher grade, especially with all the\r\nnations of civilization, excepting here and there, not the man seeks the\r\nwoman, but the woman him. It happens rarely that a woman openly takes\r\nthe initiative, and offers herself to the man; so-called propriety\r\nforbids that. In point of fact, however, the offering is done by the\r\nmanner of her appearance; by means of the beauty of dress and luxury,\r\nthat she displays; by the manner in which she ornaments herself, and\r\npresents herself, and coquets in society. The excess of women, together\r\nwith the social necessity of looking upon matrimony as an institute for\r\nsupport, or as an institution through which alone she can satisfy her\r\nsexual impulse and gain a standing in society, forces such conduct upon\r\nher. Here also, we notice again, it is purely economic and social causes\r\nthat call forth, one time with man, another with woman, a quality that,\r\nuntil now, it was customary to look upon as wholly independent of social\r\nand economic causes. Hence the conclusion is justified, that so soon as\r\nsociety shall arrive at social conditions, under which all dependence of\r\none sex upon another shall have ceased, and both are equally free,\r\n_ridiculous vanity and the folly of fashion will vanish, just as so many\r\nother vices that we consider to-day uneradicable, as supposedly inherent\r\nin man_. Schopenhauer, as a philosopher, judges woman as one-sidedly as\r\nmost of our anthropologists and physicians, who see in her only the\r\nsexual, never the social, being. Schopenhauer was never married. He,\r\naccordingly, has not, on his part, contributed towards having one more\r\nwoman pay the \"debt of life\" that he debits woman with. And this brings\r\nus to the other side of the medal, which is far from being the\r\nhandsomer.\r\n\r\nMany women do not marry, simply because they cannot. Everybody knows\r\nthat usage forbids woman to offer herself. She must allow herself to be\r\nwooed, i. e., chosen. She herself may not woo. Is there no wooer to be\r\nhad, then she enters the large army of those poor beings who have missed\r\nthe purpose of life, and, in view of the lack of safe material\r\nfoundation, generally fall a prey to want and misery, and but too often\r\nto ridicule also. But few know what the discrepancy in numbers between\r\nthe two sexes is due to; many are ready with the hasty answer: \"There\r\nare too many girls born.\" Those who make the claim are wrongly\r\ninformed, as will be shown. Others, again, who admit the unnaturalness\r\nof celibacy, conclude from the fact that women are more numerous than\r\nmen in most countries of civilization, that polygamy should be allowed.\r\nBut not only does polygamy do violence to our customs, it, moreover,\r\ndegrades woman, a circumstance that, of course, does not restrain\r\nSchopenhauer, with his underestimation of and contempt for women, from\r\ndeclaring: \"For the female sex, as a whole, polygamy is a benefit.\"\r\n\r\nMany men do not marry because they think they cannot support a wife, and\r\nthe children that may come, according to their station. To support _two_\r\nwives is, however, possible to a small minority only, and among these\r\nare many who now have two or more wives,--one legitimate and several\r\nillegitimate. These few, privileged by wealth, are not held back by\r\nanything from doing what they please. Even in the Orient, where polygamy\r\nexists for thousands of years by law and custom, comparatively few men\r\nhave more than one wife. People talk of the demoralizing influence of\r\nTurkish harem life; but the fact is overlooked that this harem life is\r\npossible only to an insignificant fraction of the men, and then only in\r\nthe ruling class, while the majority of the men live in monogamy. In the\r\ncity of Algiers, there were, at the close of the sixties, out of 18,282\r\nmarriages, not less than 17,319 with one wife only; 888 were with two;\r\nand only 75 with more than two. Constantinople, the capital of the\r\nTurkish Empire, would show no materially different result. Among the\r\ncountry population in the Orient, the proportion is still more\r\npronouncedly in favor of single marriages. In the Orient, exactly as\r\nwith us, the most important factor in the calculation are the material\r\nconditions, and these compel most men to limit themselves to but one\r\nwife. If, on the other hand, material conditions were equally favorable\r\nto all men, polygamy would still not be practicable,--for want of women.\r\n_The almost equal number of the two sexes, prevalent under normal\r\nconditions, points everywhere to monogamy._\r\n\r\nAs proof of these statements, we cite the following tables, that Buecher\r\npublished in an essay.[92]\r\n\r\nIn these tables the distinction must be kept in mind between the\r\nenumerated and the estimated populations. In so far as the population\r\nwas enumerated, the fact is expressly stated in the summary for the\r\nseparate main divisions of the earth. The sexes divide themselves in the\r\npopulation of several divisions and countries as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

If it\r\nis further considered that in the foreign divisions of the earth, and\r\neven there where actual enumeration was had, information upon the female\r\nsex is particularly defective--a fact that must be presumed with regard\r\nto all the countries of Mohammedan population, where the figures for the\r\nfemale population are probably below the reality--it stands pat that,\r\napart from a few European nations, the female sex nowhere tangibly\r\nexceeds the male. It is otherwise in Europe, the country that interests\r\nus most. Here, with the exception of Italy and the southeast territories\r\nof Bosnia, Herzegovina, Servia, Bulgaria, Roumania and Greece, the\r\nfemale population is everywhere more strongly represented than the male.\r\nOf the large European countries, the disproportion is slightest in\r\nFrance--1,002 females to every 1,000 males; next in order is Russia,\r\nwith 1,009 females to every 1,000 males. On the other hand, Portugal,\r\nNorway and Poland, with 1,076 females to every 1,000 males, present the\r\nstrongest disproportion. Next to these stands Great Britain,--1,060\r\nfemales to every 1,000 males. Germany and Austria lie in the middle:\r\nthey have, respectively, 1,039 and 1,047 females to every 1,000 males.\r\n\r\nIn the German Empire, the excess of the female over the male population,\r\naccording to the census of December 1, 1890, was 957,400, against\r\n988,376, according to the census of December 1, 1885. A principal cause\r\nof this disproportion is emigration, inasmuch as by far more men\r\nemigrate than women. This is clearly brought out by the opposite pole of\r\nGermany, the North American Union, which has about as large a deficit in\r\nwomen as Germany has a surplus. The United States is the principal\r\ncountry for European emigration, and this is mainly made up of males. A\r\nsecond cause is the larger number of accidents to men than to women in\r\nagriculture, the trades, the industries and transportation. Furthermore,\r\nthere are more males than females temporarily abroad,--merchants,\r\nseamen, marines, etc. All this transpires clearly from the figures on\r\nthe conjugal status. In 1890 there were 8,372,486 married men to\r\n8,398,607 married women in Germany, i. e., 26,121 more of the latter.\r\nAnother phenomenon, that statistics establish and that weigh heavily in\r\nthe scales, is that, on an average, women reach a higher age than men:\r\nat the more advanced ages there are more women than men. According to\r\nthe census of 1890 the relation of ages among the two sexes were these:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              Excess   Excess of\r\n                        Males.

Everywhere,\r\nthere are more boys born than girls. In the German Empire, for\r\ninstance,[94] there were born:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the year 1872 to 100 girls 106.2 boys\r\n    In the year 1878 to 100 girls 105.9 boys\r\n    In the year 1884 to 100 girls 106.2 boys\r\n    In the year 1888 to 100 girls 106.0 boys\r\n    In the year 1891 to 100 girls 106.2 boys\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the male sex dies earlier than the female, and from early childhood\r\nmore boys die than girls. Accordingly, the table shows that, between the\r\nages of 10 to 20 the female sex exceeds the male.\r\n\r\nTo each 100 females, there died, males:--[95]\r\n\r\n\r\n    In 1872   107.0    In 1884   109.2\r\n    In 1878   110.5    In 1888   107.9\r\n                       In 1891   107.5\r\n\r\n\r\nThe table shows, furthermore, that at the matrimonial age, proper,\r\nbetween the ages of 20 and 50, the female sex exceeds the male by\r\n422,519, and that at the age from 50 to 70 and above, it exceeds the\r\nmale by 566,400. A very strong disproportion between the sexes appears,\r\nfurthermore, among the widowed.\r\n\r\nAccording to the census of 1890, there were:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Widowers                           774,967\r\n    Widows                           2,154,870\r\n                                     ---------\r\n    Excess of widows over widowers   1,382,903\r\n\r\n\r\nOf these widowed people, according to age, there were:--\r\n\r\n\r\n      Age.

Females.\r\n    40-60           222,286           842,920\r\n    60 and over     506,319         1,158,712\r\n\r\n\r\nThe number of divorced persons was, in 1890: Males, 25,271; females,\r\n49,601. According to age, they were distributed:--\r\n\r\n\r\n      Age.         Males.     Females.\r\n    40-60          13,825       24,842\r\n    60 and over     4,917        7,244\r\n\r\n\r\nThese figures tell us that _widows and divorced women are excluded from\r\nremarriage_, and at the fittest age for matrimony, at that; there being\r\nof the age of 15-40, 46,362 widowers and 156,235 widows, 6,519 divorced\r\nmen and 17,515 divorced women. These figures furnish further proof of\r\nthe injury that divorce entails to married women.\r\n\r\nIn 1890, there were unmarried:--[96]\r\n\r\n\r\n      Age.          Males.     Females.\r\n    15-40        5,845,933    5,191,453\r\n    40-60          375,881      503,406\r\n    60 and over    130,154      230,966\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, among the unmarried population between the ages of 15 and\r\n40, the male sex is stronger by 654,480 than the female. This\r\ncircumstance would seem to be favorable for the latter. But males\r\nbetween the ages of 15 and 21 are, with few exceptions, not in condition\r\nto marry. Of that age there were 3,590,622 males to 3,774,025 females.\r\nLikewise with the males of the age of 21-25, a large number are not in a\r\nposition to start a family: we have but to keep in mind the males in the\r\narmy, students, etc. On the other side, all women of this age period are\r\nmarriageable. Taking further into consideration that for a great variety\r\nof reasons, many men do not marry at all--the number of unmarried males\r\nof 40 years of age and over alone amounted to 506,035, to which must be\r\nadded also the widowed and divorced males, more than two million\r\nstrong--it follows that the situation of the female sex with regard to\r\nmarriage is decidedly unfavorable. Accordingly, a large number of women\r\nare, under present circumstances, forced to renounce the legitimate\r\ngratification of their sexual instincts, while the males seek and find\r\nsolace in prostitution. The situation would instantaneously change for\r\nwomen with the removal of the obstacles that keep to-day many hundreds\r\nof thousands of men from setting up a married home, and from doing\r\njustice to their natural instincts in a legitimate manner. For that the\r\nexisting social system must be upturned.\r\n\r\nAs already observed, emigration across the seas is, in great part,\r\nresponsible for the disproportion in the number of the sexes. In the\r\nyears 1872-1886, on an average, more than 10,000 males left the country\r\nin excess of females. For a period of fifteen years, that runs up to\r\n150,000 males, most of them in the very vigor of life. Military duties\r\nalso drive abroad many young men, and the most vigorous, at that. In\r\n1893, according to the report officially submitted to the Reichstag on\r\nthe subject of substitutes in the army, 25,851 men were sentenced for\r\nemigrating without leave, and 14,522 more cases were under investigation\r\non the same charge. Similar figures recur from year to year. The loss in\r\nmen that Germany sustains from this unlawful emigration is considerable\r\nin the course of a century. Especially strong is emigration during the\r\nyears that follow upon great wars. That appears from the figures after\r\n1866 and between 1871 and 1874. We sustain, moreover, severe losses in\r\nmale life from accidents. In the course of the years 1887 to 1892, the\r\nnumber of persons killed in the trades, agriculture, State and municipal\r\nundertakings, ran up to 30,568,[97] of whom only a small fraction were\r\nwomen. Furthermore, another and considerable number of persons engaged\r\nin these occupations are crippled for life by accidents, and are\r\ndisabled from starting a family; others die early and leave their\r\nfamilies behind in want and misery. Great loss in male life is also\r\nconnected with navigation. In the period between 1882-1891, 1,485 ships\r\nwere lost on the high seas, whereby 2,436 members of crews--with few\r\nexceptions males--and 747 passengers perished.\r\n\r\nOnce the right appreciation of life is had, society will prevent the\r\nlarge majority of accidents, particularly in navigation; and such\r\nappreciation will touch its highest point under Socialist order. In\r\nnumberless instances human life, or the safety of limb, is sacrificed to\r\nmisplaced economy on the part of employers, who recoil before any outlay\r\nfor protection; in many others the tired condition of the workman, or\r\nthe hurry he must work in, is the cause. Human life is cheap; if one\r\nworkingman goes to pieces, three others are at hand to take his place.\r\n\r\nOn the domain of navigation especially, and aided by the difficulty of\r\ncontrol, many unpardonable wrongs are committed. Through the revelations\r\nmade during the seventies by Plimsoll in the British Parliament, the\r\nfact has become notorious that many shipowners, yielding to criminal\r\ngreed, take out high insurances for vessels that are not seaworthy, and\r\nunconscionably expose them, together with their crews, to the slightest\r\nweather at sea,--all for the sake of the high insurance. These are the\r\nso-called \"coffin-ships,\" not unknown in Germany, either. The steamer\r\n\"Braunschweig,\" for instance, that sank in 1881 near Helgoland, and\r\nbelonged to the firm Rocholl & Co., of Bremen, proved to have been put\r\nto sea in a wholly unseaworthy condition. The same fate befell, in 1889,\r\nthe steamer \"Leda\" of the same firm; hardly out at sea, she went to the\r\nbottom. The boat was insured with the Russian Lloyd for 55,000 rubles;\r\nthe prospect of 8,500 rubles were held out to the captain, if he took\r\nher safe to Odessa; and the captain, in turn, paid the pilot the\r\ncomparatively high wage of 180 rubles a month. The verdict of the Court\r\nof Admiralty was that _the accident was due to the fact that the \"Leda\"\r\nwas unseaworthy and unfit to be taken to Odessa_. The license was\r\nwithdrawn from the captain. According to existing laws, the real guilty\r\nparties could not be reached. No year goes by without our Court of\r\nAdmiralty having to pass upon a larger number of accidents at sea, to\r\nthe effect that the accident was due to vessels being too old, or too\r\nheavily loaded, or in defective condition, or insufficiently equipped;\r\nsometimes to several of these causes combined. With a good many of the\r\nlost ships, the cause of accident can not be established: they have gone\r\ndown in midocean, and no survivor remains to tell the tale. Likewise are\r\nthe coast provisions for the saving of shipwrecked lives both defective\r\nand insufficient; they are dependent mainly upon private charity. The\r\ncase is even more disconsolate along distant and foreign coasts. A\r\ncommonwealth that makes the promotion of the well-being of all its\r\nhighest mission will not fail to so improve navigation, and provide it\r\nwith protective measures that these accidents would be of rare\r\noccurrence. But the modern economic system of rapine, that weighs men as\r\nit weighs figures, to the end of whacking out the largest possible\r\namount of profit, not infrequently destroys a human life if thereby\r\nthere be in it but the profit of a dollar. With the change of society in\r\nthe Socialist sense, immigration, in its present shape, also would drop;\r\nthe flight from military service would cease; suicide in the Army would\r\nbe no more.\r\n\r\nThe picture drawn from our political and economic life shows that woman\r\nalso is deeply interested therein. Whether the period of military\r\nservice be shortened or not; whether the Army be increased or not;\r\nwhether the country pursues a policy of peace or one of war; whether the\r\ntreatment allotted to the soldier be worthy or unworthy of human beings;\r\nand whether as a result thereof the number of suicides and desertions\r\nrise or drop;--_all of these are questions that concern woman as much as\r\nman_. Likewise with the economic and industrial conditions and in\r\ntransportation, in all of which branches the female sex, furthermore,\r\nsteps from year to year more numerously as working-women. Bad\r\nconditions, and unfavorable circumstances injure woman as a social and\r\nas a sexual being; favorable conditions and satisfactory circumstances\r\nbenefit her.\r\n\r\nBut there are still other momenta that go to make marriage difficult or\r\nimpossible. A considerable number of men are kept from marriage by the\r\nState itself. People pucker up their brows at the celibacy imposed upon\r\nRoman Catholic clergymen; but these same people have not a word of\r\ncondemnation for the much larger number of soldiers who also are\r\ncondemned thereto. The officers not only require the consent of their\r\nsuperiors, they are also limited in the choice of a wife: the regulation\r\nprescribes that she shall have property to a certain, and not\r\ninsignificant, amount. In this way the Austrian corps of officers, for\r\ninstance, obtained a social \"improvement\" at the cost of the female sex.\r\nCaptains rose by fully 8,000 guilders, if above thirty years of age,\r\nwhile the captains under thirty years of age were thenceforth hard to be\r\nhad, in no case for a smaller dower than 30,000. \"Now a 'Mrs. Captain,'\"\r\nit was thus reported in the \"Koelnische Zeitung\" from Vienna, \"who until\r\nnow was often a subject of pity for her female colleagues in the\r\nadministrative departments, can hold her head higher by a good deal;\r\neverybody now knows that she has wherewith to live. Despite the greatly\r\nincreased requirements of personal excellence, culture and rank, the\r\nsocial status of the Austrian officer was until then rather indefinite,\r\npartly because very prominent gentlemen stuck fast to the Emperor's coat\r\npocket; partly because many poor officers could not make a shift to live\r\nwithout humiliation, and many families of poor officers often played a\r\npitiful _role_. Until then, the officer who wished to marry had, if the\r\nthirty-year line was crossed, to qualify in joint property to the amount\r\nof 12,000 guilders, or in a 600-guilder side income, and even at this\r\ninsignificant income, hardly enough for decency, the magistrates often\r\nshut their eyes, and granted relief. The new marriage regulations are\r\nsavagely severe, though the heart break. The captain under thirty must\r\nforthwith deposit 30,000 guilders; over thirty years of age, 20,000\r\nguilders; from staff officers up to colonels, 16,000 guilders. Over and\r\nabove this, only one-fourth of the officers may marry without special\r\ngrace, while a spotless record and corresponding rank is demanded of the\r\nbride. This all holds good for officers of the line and army surgeons.\r\nFor other military officials with the rank of officer, the new marriage\r\nregulations are milder; but for officers of the general staff still\r\nseverer. The officer who is detailed to the captain of the general staff\r\nmay not thereafter marry; the actual captain of the staff, if below\r\nthirty, is required to give security in 36,000 guilders, and later\r\n24,000 more.\" In Germany and elsewhere, there are similar regulations.\r\nAlso the corps of under-officers is subject to hampering regulations\r\nwith regard to marriage, and require besides the consent of their\r\nsuperior officers. These are very drastic proofs of the _purely\r\nmaterialistic conception_ that the State has of marriage.\r\n\r\nIn general, public opinion is agreed that marriage is not advisable for\r\nmen under twenty-four or twenty-five years of age. Twenty-five is the\r\nmarriageable age for men fixed by the civil code, with an eye to the\r\ncivic independence that, as a rule, is not gained before that age. Only\r\nwith persons who are in the agreeable position of not having to first\r\nconquer independence--with people of princely rank--does public opinion\r\nconsider it proper when occasionally the men marry at the age of\r\neighteen or nineteen, the girls at that of fifteen or sixteen. The\r\nPrince is declared of age with his eighteenth year, and considered\r\ncapable to govern a vast empire and numerous people. Common mortals\r\nacquire the right to govern their possible property only at the age of\r\ntwenty-one.\r\n\r\nThe difference of opinion as to the age when marriage is desirable shows\r\nthat public opinion judges by the social standing of the bride and\r\nbridegroom. Its reasons have nothing to do with the human being as a\r\nnatural entity, or with its natural instincts. It happens, however, that\r\nNature's impulses do not yoke themselves to social conditions, nor to\r\nthe views and prejudices that spring from them. So soon as man has\r\nreached maturity, the sexual instincts assert themselves with force;\r\nindeed, they are the incarnation of the human being, and they demand\r\nsatisfaction from the mature being, at the peril of severe physical and\r\nmental suffering.\r\n\r\nThe age of sexual ripeness differs according to individuals, climate and\r\nhabits of life. In the warm zone it sets in with the female sex, as a\r\nrule, at the age of eleven to twelve years, and not infrequently are\r\nwomen met with there, who, already at that age, carry offspring on their\r\narms; but at their twenty-fifth or thirtieth year, these have lost their\r\nbloom. In the temperate zone, the rule with the female sex is from the\r\nfourteenth to the sixteenth year, in some cases later. Likewise is the\r\nage of puberty different between country and city women. With healthy,\r\nrobust country girls, who move much in the open air and work vigorously,\r\nmenstruation sets in later, on the average, than with our badly\r\nnourished, weak, hypernervous, ethereal city young ladies. Yonder,\r\nsexual maturity develops normally, with rare disturbances; here a normal\r\ndevelopment is the exception: all manner of illnesses set in, often\r\ndriving the physician to desperation. How often are not physicians\r\ncompelled to declare that, along with a change of life, the most radical\r\ncure is marriage. But how apply such a cure? Insuperable obstacles rise\r\nagainst the proposition.\r\n\r\nAll this goes to show where the change must be looked for. In the first\r\nplace, the point is to make possible a totally different education, one\r\nthat takes into consideration the physical as well as the mental being;\r\nin the second place, to establish a wholly different system of life and\r\nof work. But both of these are, without exception, possible for all only\r\nunder _wholly different social conditions_.\r\n\r\nOur social conditions have raised a violent contradiction between man,\r\nas a natural and sexual being, on the one hand, and man as a social\r\nbeing on the other. The contradiction has made itself felt at no period\r\nas strongly as at this; and it produces a number of diseases into whose\r\nnature we will go no further, but that affect mainly the female sex: in\r\nthe first place, her organism depends, in much higher degree than that\r\nof man, upon her sexual mission, and is influenced thereby, as shown by\r\nthe regular recurrence of her periods; in the second place, most of the\r\nobstacles to marriage lie in the way of women, preventing her from\r\nsatisfying her strongest natural impulse in a natural manner. The\r\ncontradiction between natural want and social compulsion goes against\r\nthe grain of Nature; it leads to secret vices and excesses that\r\nundermine every organism but the strongest.\r\n\r\nUnnatural gratification, especially with the female sex, is often most\r\nshamelessly promoted. More or less underhandedly, certain preparations\r\nare praised, and they are recommended especially in the advertisements\r\nof most of the papers that penetrate into the family circle as\r\nespecially devoted to its entertainment. These puffs are addressed\r\nmainly to the better situated portion of society, seeing the prices of\r\nthe preparations are so high that a family of small means can hardly\r\ncome by them. Side by side with these shameless advertisements are found\r\nthe puffs--meant for the eyes of both sexes--of obscene pictures,\r\nespecially of whole series of photographs, of poems and prose works of\r\nsimilar stripe, aimed at sexual incitation, and that call for the action\r\nof police and District Attorneys. But these gentlemen are too busy with\r\nthe \"civilization, marriage and family-destroying\" Socialist movement to\r\nbe able to devote full attention to such machinations. A part of our\r\nworks of fiction labors in the same direction. The wonder would be if\r\nsexual excesses, artificially incited, besides, failed to manifest\r\nthemselves in unhealthy and harmful ways, and to assume the proportions\r\nof a social disease.\r\n\r\nThe idle, voluptuous life of many women in the property classes; their\r\nrefined measures of nervous stimulants; their overfeeding with a certain\r\nkind of artificial sensation, cultivated in certain lines on the\r\nhothouse plan, and often considered the principal topic of conversation\r\nand sign of culture by that portion of the female sex that suffers of\r\nhypersensitiveness and nervous excitement;--all this incites still more\r\nthe sexual senses, and naturally leads to excesses.\r\n\r\nAmong the poor, it is certain exhausting occupations, especially of a\r\nsedentary nature, that promotes congestion of blood in the abdominal\r\norgans, and promotes sexual excitation. One of the most dangerous\r\noccupations in this direction is connected with the, at present, widely\r\nspread sewing machine. This occupation works such havoc that, with ten\r\nor twelve hours' daily work, the strongest organism is ruined within a\r\nfew years. Excessive sexual excitement is also promoted by long hours of\r\nwork in a steady high temperature, for instance, sugar refineries,\r\nbleacheries, cloth-pressing establishments, night work by gaslight in\r\novercrowded rooms, especially when both sexes work together.\r\n\r\nA succession of further phenomena has been here unfolded, sharply\r\nillustrative of the irrationableness and unhealthiness of modern\r\nconditions. These are evils deeply rooted in our social state of things,\r\nand removable neither by the moral sermonizings nor the palliatives that\r\nreligious quacks of the male and female sexes have so readily at hand.\r\nThe axe must be laid to the root of the evil. The question is to bring\r\nabout a natural system of education, together with healthy conditions of\r\nlife and work, and to do this in amplest manner, to the end that the\r\nnormal gratification of natural and healthy instincts be made possible\r\nfor all.\r\n\r\nAs to the male sex, a number of considerations are absent that are\r\npresent with the female sex. Due to his position as master, and in so\r\nfar as social barriers do not hinder him, there is on the side of man\r\nthe free choice of love. On the other hand, the character of marriage as\r\nan institution for support, the excess of women, custom;--all these\r\ncircumstances conspire to prevent woman from manifesting her will; they\r\nforce her to wait till she is wanted. As a rule, she seizes gladly the\r\nopportunity, soon as offered, to reach the hand to the man who redeems\r\nher from the social ostracism and neglect, that is the lot of that poor\r\nwaif, the \"old maid.\" Often she looks down with contempt upon those of\r\nher sisters who have yet preserved their self-respect, and have not sold\r\nthemselves into mental prostitution to the first comer, preferring to\r\ntread single the thorny path of life.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, social considerations tie down the man, who desires\r\nto reach by marriage the gratification of his life's requirements. He\r\nmust put himself the question: Can you support a wife, and the children\r\nthat may come, so that pressing cares, the destroyers of your happiness,\r\nmay be kept away? The better his marital intentions are, the more\r\nideally he conceives them, the more he is resolved to wed only out of\r\nlove, all the more earnestly must he put the question to himself. To\r\nmany, the affirmative answer is, under the present economic conditions,\r\na matter of impossibility: they prefer to remain single. With other and\r\nless conscientious men, another set of considerations crowd upon the\r\nmind. Thousands of men reach an independent position, one in accord with\r\ntheir wants, only comparatively late. But they can keep a wife in a\r\nstyle suitable to their station only if she has large wealth. True\r\nenough, many young men have exaggerated notions on the requirements of a\r\nso-called life \"suitable to one's station.\" Nevertheless, they can not\r\nbe blamed--as a result of the false education above described, and of\r\nthe social habits of a large number of women,--for not guarding against\r\ndemands from that quarter that are far beyond their powers. Good women,\r\nmodest in their demands, these men often never come to know. These\r\nwomen are retiring; they are not to be found there where such men have\r\nacquired the habit of looking for a wife; while those whom they meet are\r\nnot infrequently such as seek to win a husband by means of their looks,\r\nand are intent, by external means, by show, to deceive him regarding\r\ntheir personal qualities and material conditions. The means of seduction\r\nof all sorts are plied all the more diligently in the measure that these\r\nladies come on in years, when marriage becomes a matter of hot haste.\r\nDoes any of these succeed in conquering a husband, she has become so\r\nhabituated to show, jewelry, finery and expensive pleasures, that she is\r\nnot inclined to forego them in marriage. The superficial nature of her\r\nbeing crops up in all directions, and therein an abyss is opened for the\r\nhusband. Hence many prefer to leave alone the flower that blooms on the\r\nedge of the precipice, and that can be plucked only at the risk of\r\nbreaking their necks. They go their ways alone, and seek company and\r\npleasure under the protection of their freedom. Deception and swindle\r\nare practices everywhere in full swing in the business life of\r\ncapitalist society: no wonder they are applied also in contracting\r\nmarriage, and that, when they succeed, both parties are drawn into\r\ncommon sorrows.\r\n\r\nAccording to E. Ansell, the age of marriage among the cultured and\r\nindependent males of England was, between 1840-1871, on an average 29.25\r\nyears. Since then the average has risen for many classes, by at least\r\none year. For the different occupations, the average age of marriage,\r\nbetween 1880-1885, was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n      Occupations.                               Age.\r\n    Miners                                       23.56\r\n    Textile workers                              23.88\r\n    Shoemakers and tailors                       24.42\r\n    Skilled laborers                             24.85\r\n    Day laborers                                 25.06\r\n    Clerks                                       25.75\r\n    Retailers                                    26.17\r\n    Farmers and their sons                       28.73\r\n    Men of culture and men of independent means  30.72\r\n\r\n\r\nThese figures give striking proof of how social conditions and standing\r\naffect marriage.\r\n\r\nThe number of men who, for several reasons, are kept from marrying is\r\never on the increase. It is especially in the so-called upper ranks and\r\noccupations that the men often do not marry, partly because the demands\r\nupon them are too great, partly because it is just the men of these\r\nsocial strata who seek and find pleasure and company elsewhere. On the\r\nother hand, conditions are particularly unfavorable to women in places\r\nwhere many pensionaries and their families, but few young men, have\r\ntheir homes. In such places, the number of women who cannot marry rises\r\nto 20 or 30 out of every 100. The deficit of candidates for marriage\r\naffects strongest those female strata that, through education and social\r\nposition, make greater pretensions, and yet, outside of their persons,\r\nhave nothing to offer the man who is looking for wealth. This concerns\r\nespecially the female members of those numerous families that live upon\r\nfixed salaries, are considered socially \"respectable,\" but are without\r\nmeans. The life of the female being in this stratum of society is,\r\ncomparatively speaking, the saddest of all those of her\r\nfellow-sufferers. It is out of these strata that is mainly recruited the\r\nmost dangerous competition for the working-women in the embroidering,\r\nseamstress, flower-making, millinery, glove and straw hat sewing; in\r\nshort, all the branches of industry that the employer prefers to have\r\ncarried on at the homes of the working-women. These ladies work for the\r\nlowest wages, seeing that, in many cases, the question with them is not\r\nto earn a full livelihood, but only something over and above that, or to\r\nearn the outlay for a better wardrobe and for luxury. Employers have a\r\npredilection for the competition of these ladies, so as to lower the\r\nearnings of the poor working-woman and squeeze the last drop of blood\r\nfrom her veins: it drives her to exert herself to the point of\r\nexhaustion. Also not a few wives of government employes, whose husbands\r\nare badly paid, and can not afford them a \"life suitable to their rank,\"\r\nutilize their leisure moments in this vile competition that presses so\r\nheavily upon wide strata of the female working class.\r\n\r\nThe activity on the part of the bourgeois associations of women for the\r\nabolition of female labor and for the admission of women to the higher\r\nprofessions, at present mainly, if not exclusively, appropriated by men,\r\naims principally at procuring a position in life for women from the\r\nsocial circles just sketched. In order to secure for their efforts\r\ngreater prospects of success, these associations have loved to place\r\nthemselves under the protectorate of higher and leading ladies. The\r\nbourgeois females imitate herein the example of the bourgeois males, who\r\nlikewise love such protectorates, and exert themselves in directions\r\nthat can bring only _small_, never _large results_. A Sisyphus work is\r\nthus done with as much noise as possible, to the end of deceiving\r\noneself and others on the score of the necessity for a radical change.\r\nThe necessity is also felt to do all that is possible in order to\r\nsuppress all doubts regarding the wisdom of the foundations of our\r\nsocial and political organization, and to prescribe them as treasonable.\r\nThe conservative nature of these endeavors prevents bourgeois\r\nassociations of women from being seized with so-called destructive\r\ntendencies. When, accordingly, at the Women's Convention of Berlin, in\r\n1894, the opinion was expressed by a minority that the bourgeois women\r\nshould go hand and hand with the working-women, i. e., with their\r\nSocialist citizens, a storm of indignation went up from the majority.\r\nBut the bourgeois women will not succeed in pulling themselves out of\r\nthe quagmire by their own topknots.\r\n\r\nHow large the number is of women who, by reason of the causes herein\r\ncited, must renounce married life, is not accurately ascertainable. In\r\nScotland, the number of unmarried women of the age of twenty years and\r\nover was, towards the close of the sixties, 43 per cent. of the female\r\npopulation, and there were 110 women to every 100 men. In England,\r\noutside of Wales, there lived at that time 1,407,228 more women than men\r\nof the age of 20 to 40, and 359,966 single women of over forty years of\r\nage. Of each 100 women 42 were unmarried.\r\n\r\nThe surplus of women that Germany owns is very unevenly distributed in\r\npoint of territories and age. According to the census of 1890, it\r\nstood:--[98]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          To Every 1,000 Males, Females of\r\n                                     the Age of\r\n      Divisions.

Seeing that,\r\nwithin these age periods, there are 9,429,720 male to 9,682,454 female\r\ninhabitants, there is a total female surplus of 252,734.

According thereto, and apart from all other\r\ncauses already mentioned, a considerable number of women have in such\r\ncountries no prospect of entering wedded life. The number of unmarried\r\nwomen is even still larger, because a large number of men prefer, for\r\nall sorts of reasons, to remain single. What say hereto those\r\nsuperficial folks, who oppose the endeavor of women after a more\r\nindependent, equal-righted position in life, and who refer them to\r\nmarriage and domestic life? The blame does not lie with the women that\r\nso many of them do not marry; and how matters stand with \"conjugal\r\nhappiness\" has been sufficiently depicted.\r\n\r\nWhat becomes of the victims of our social conditions? The resentment of\r\ninsulted and injured Nature expresses itself in the peculiar facial\r\nlines and characteristics whereby so-called old maids, the same as old\r\nascetic bachelors, stamp themselves different from other human beings in\r\nall countries and all climates; and it gives testimony of the mighty and\r\nharmful effect of suppressed natural love. Nymphomania with women, and\r\nnumerous kinds of hysteria, have their origin in that source; and also\r\ndiscontent in married life produces attacks of hysteria, and is\r\nresponsible for barrenness.\r\n\r\nSuch, in main outlines, is our modern married life and its effects. The\r\nconclusion is: _Modern marriage is an institution that is closely\r\nconnected with the existing social condition, and stands or falls with\r\nit. But this marriage is in the course of dissolution and decay, exactly\r\nas capitalist society itself_,--because, as demonstrated under the\r\nseveral heads on the subject of marriage:\r\n\r\n1. Relatively, the number of births declines, although population\r\nincreases on the whole,--showing that the condition of the family\r\ndeteriorates.\r\n\r\n2. Actions for divorce increase in numbers, considerably more than does\r\npopulation, and, in the majority of cases, the plaintiffs are women,\r\nalthough, both economically and socially, they are the greatest\r\nsufferers thereunder,--showing that the unfavorable factors, that\r\noperate upon marriage, are on the increase, and marriage, accordingly,\r\nis dissolving and falling to pieces.\r\n\r\n3. Relatively, the number of marriages is on the decline, although\r\npopulation increases,--showing again that marriage, in the eyes of many,\r\nno longer answers its social and moral purposes, and is considered\r\nworthless, or dangerous.\r\n\r\n4. In almost all the countries of civilization there is a disproportion\r\nbetween the number of the sexes, and to the disadvantage of the female\r\nsex, and the disproportion is not caused by births--there are, on the\r\naverage, more boys born than girls,--but is due to unfavorable social\r\nand political causes, that lie in the political and economic conditions.\r\n\r\n_Seeing that all these unnatural conditions, harmful to woman in\r\nparticular, are grounded in the nature of capitalist society, and grow\r\nworse as this social system continues, the same proves itself unable to\r\nend the evil and emancipate woman. Another social order is, accordingly,\r\nrequisite thereto._\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[86] Plato requires in his \"Republic\" that \"the women be educated like\r\nthe men,\" and he demands careful selection in breeding. He, accordingly,\r\nwas thoroughly familiar with the effect of a careful selection on the\r\ndevelopment of man. Aristotle lays it down as a maxim of education that\r\n\"First the body, then the mind must be built up,\" Aristotle's\r\n\"Politics.\" With us, when thought is at all bestowed upon the matter,\r\nthe body, the scaffolding for the intellect, is considered last.\r\n\r\n[87] \"Die Mission unseres Jahrhunderts.

Troll-Borostyani; Pressburg and Leipsic.\r\n\r\n[88] In \"Les Femmes Qui Tuent et les Femmes Qui Votent,\" Alexander\r\nDumas, son, narrates: \"A Catholic clergyman of high standing stated in\r\nthe course of a conversation that, out of a hundred of his former female\r\npupils, who married, after a month at least eighty came to him and said\r\nthey were disillusioned and regretted having married.\" This sounds very\r\nprobable. The Voltarian French bourgeoisie reconcile it with their\r\nconscience to allow their daughters to be educated in the cloisters.\r\nThey proceed from the premises that an ignorant woman is more easy to\r\nlead than one who is posted. Conflicts and disappointment are\r\ninevitable. Laboulaye gives the flat-footed advice to keep woman in\r\nmoderate ignorance, because \"notre empire est detruit, si l'homme est\r\nreconnu\" (our empire is over if man is found out).\r\n\r\n[89] According to observations made in the psychiatric clinic at Vienna,\r\nparalysis (softening of the brain) is making by far greater progress\r\namong women than among men.

Marriage is the\r\nobverse, prostitution the reverse of the medal. If men find no\r\nsatisfaction in wedlock, then they usually seek the same in\r\nprostitution. Those men, who, for whatever reason, renounce married\r\nlife, also usually seek satisfaction in prostitution. To those men,\r\naccordingly, who, whether out of their free will or out of compulsion,\r\nlive in celibacy, as well as to those whom marriage does not offer what\r\nwas expected of it, conditions are more favorable for the gratification\r\nof the sexual impulse than to women.\r\n\r\nMan ever has looked upon the use of prostitution as a privilege due him\r\nof right. All the harder and severer does he keep guard and pass\r\nsentence when a woman, who is no prostitute, commits a \"slip.\" That\r\nwoman is instinct with the same impulses as man, aye, that at given\r\nperiods of her life (at menstruation) these impulses assert themselves\r\nmore vehemently than at others,--that does not trouble him. In virtue of\r\nhis position as master, he compels her to violently suppress her most\r\npowerful impulses, and he conditions both her character in society and\r\nher marriage upon her chastity. Nothing illustrates more drastically,\r\nand also revoltingly, the dependence of woman upon man than this\r\nradically different conception regarding the gratification of the\r\nidentical natural impulse, and the radically different measure by which\r\nit is judged.\r\n\r\nTo man, circumstances are particularly favorable. Nature has devolved\r\nupon woman the consequences of the act of generation: outside of the\r\nenjoyment, man has neither trouble nor responsibility. This advantageous\r\nposition over against woman has promoted that unbridled license in\r\nsexual indulgence wherein a considerable part of men distinguish\r\nthemselves. Seeing, however, that, as has been shown, a hundred causes\r\nlie in the way of the legitimate gratification of the sexual instinct,\r\nor prevent its full satisfaction, the consequence is frequent\r\ngratification, like beasts in the woods.\r\n\r\n_Prostitution thus becomes a social institution in the capitalist world,\r\nthe same as the police, standing armies, the Church, and\r\nwage-mastership._\r\n\r\nNor is this an exaggeration. We shall prove it.\r\n\r\nWe have told how the ancient world looked upon prostitution, and\r\nconsidered it necessary, aye, had it organized by the State, as well in\r\nGreece as in Rome. What views existed on the subject during the Middle\r\nAges has likewise been described. Even St. Augustine, who, next to St.\r\nPaul, must be looked upon as the most important prop of Christendom, and\r\nwho diligently preached asceticism, could not refrain from exclaiming:\r\n\"Suppress the public girls, and the violence of passion will knock\r\neverything of a heap.\" The provincial Council of Milan, in 1665,\r\nexpressed itself in similar sense.\r\n\r\nLet us hear the moderns:\r\n\r\nDr. F. S. Huegel says:[100] \"Advancing civilization will gradually drape\r\nprostitution in more pleasing forms, but only with the end of the world\r\nwill it be wiped off the globe.\" A bold assertion; yet he who is not\r\nable to project himself beyond the capitalist form of society, he who\r\ndoes not realize that society will change so as to arrive at healthy and\r\nnatural social conditions,--he must agree with Dr. Huegel.\r\n\r\nHence also did Dr. Wichern, the late pious Director of the Rauhen House\r\nnear Hamburg, Dr. Patton of Lyon, Dr. William Tait of Edinburg, and Dr.\r\nParent-Duchatelet of Paris, celebrated through his investigations of the\r\nsexual diseases and prostitution, agree in declaring: \"Prostitution is\r\nineradicable _because it hangs together with the social institutions_,\"\r\nand all of them demanded its regulation by the State. Also Schmoelder\r\nwrites: \"Immorality as a trade has existed at all times and in all\r\nplaces, and, so far as the human eye can see, _it will remain a constant\r\ncompanion_ of the human race.\"[101] Seeing that the authorities cited\r\nstand, without exception, upon the ground of the modern social order,\r\nthe thought occurs to none that, with the aid of another social order,\r\nthe causes of prostitution, and, consequently, prostitution itself,\r\nmight disappear; none of them seeks to fathom the causes. Indeed, upon\r\none and another, engaged in this question, the fact at times dawns that\r\nthe sorry social conditions, which numerous women suffer under, might be\r\nthe chief reason why so many women sell their bodies; but the thought\r\ndoes not press itself through to its conclusion, to wit, that,\r\ntherefore, the necessity arises of bringing about other social\r\nconditions. Among those who recognize that the economic conditions are\r\nthe chief cause of prostitution belong Th. Bade, who declares:[102] \"The\r\ncauses of the bottomless moral depravity, out of which the prostitute\r\ngirl is born, lie in the existing social conditions.... _It is the\r\nbourgeois dissolution of the middle classes and of their material\r\nexistence, particularly of the class of the artisans_, only a small\r\nfraction of which carries on to-day an independent occupation as a\r\ntrade.\" Bade closes his observations, saying: \"Want for material\r\nexistence, that has partly worn out the families of the middle class and\r\nwill yet wear them out wholly, leads also to the moral ruin of the\r\nfamily, especially of the female sex.\" In fact, the statistical figures,\r\ngathered by the Police Department of Berlin, between 1871-1872, on the\r\nextraction of 2,224 enrolled prostitutes, show:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Number.  Per Cent.   Father's Occupation.\r\n\r\n     1,015     47.9     Artisans\r\n       467     22.0     Millhands\r\n       305     14.4     Small office-holders\r\n       222     10.4     Merchants and railroad workers\r\n        87     4.1      Farmers\r\n        26     1.2      Military service\r\n\r\n\r\nOf 102 the father's occupation was not ascertainable.\r\n\r\nSpecialists and experts rarely take up investigations of a deeper\r\nnature; they accept the facts that lie before them, and judge in the\r\nstyle of the \"Wiener Medizinische Wochenschrift,\" that writes in its No.\r\n35, for the year 1863: \"What else is there left to the large majority of\r\nwilling and unwilling celibates, in order to satisfy their _natural\r\nwants_, than the forbidden fruit of the Venus Pandemos?\" The paper is,\r\naccordingly, of the opinion that, for the sake of these celibates,\r\nprostitution is necessary, because what else, forsooth, are they to do\r\nin order to satisfy their sexual impulse? And it closes, saying: \"Seeing\r\nthat prostitution is necessary, it has the right to existence, to\r\nprotection, and to immunity from the State.\" And Dr. Huegel declares\r\nhimself in his work, mentioned above, in accord with this view. Man,\r\naccordingly, to whom celibacy is a horror and a martyrdom, is the only\r\nbeing considered; that there are also millions of women living in\r\ncelibacy is well known; but they have to submit. What is right for man,\r\nis, accordingly, wrong for women; is in her case immorality and a crime.\r\n\r\nThe Leipsic Police Doctor, Dr. J. Kuehn, says:[103] \"Prostitution is not\r\nmerely an evil that must be tolerated, _it is a necessary evil_, because\r\nit protects the wives from infidelity, [which only the husbands have the\r\nright to be guilty of] and virtue also [female virtue, of course, the\r\nhusbands have no need of the commodity] from being assailed [sic.] and,\r\ntherefore, from falling.\" These few words of Dr. Kuehn typify, in all\r\nits nakedness, the crass egoism of male creation. Kuehn takes the\r\ncorrect stand for a Police Doctor, who, by superintending prostitution,\r\nsacrifices himself, to the end of saving the men from disagreeable\r\ndiseases. In the same sense with him did his successor, Dr. Eckstein,\r\nutter himself at the twelfth convention of the German Associations of\r\nHouse and City Real Estate Owners, held in Magdeburg in the summer of\r\n1890. The honorable house-owners wished to know how they could prevent\r\nthe numerous instances of prostitutes occupying their houses, and how to\r\nprotect themselves against fines in case prostitutes are caught living\r\nin them. Dr. Eckstein lectured them on this head to the effect that\r\nprostitution was a \"necessary evil,\" never absent from any people or\r\nreligion. Another interesting gentleman is Dr. Fock, who in a treatise,\r\nentitled \"Prostitution, in Its Ethical and Sanitary Respects,\" in the\r\n\"Deutschen Vierteljahrschrift fuer offentliche Gesundheitspflege,\" vol.\r\nxx, No. 1, considers prostitution \"an unenviable corollary of our\r\ncivilized arrangements.\" He fears an over-production of people if all\r\nwere to marry upon reaching the age of puberty; hence he considers\r\nimportant to have prostitution \"regulated\" by the State. He considers\r\nnatural that the State supervise and regulate prostitution, and thereby\r\nassume the care of providing for the supply of girls that are free from\r\nsyphilis. He pronounces himself in favor of the most rigid inspection of\r\n\"all women, proven to lead an abandoned life;\"--also when ladies of \"an\r\nabandoned life\" belong to the prominent classes? It is the old story.\r\nThat in all logic and justice also those men should be held under\r\nsurveillance who hunt up prostitutes, maintain them and make their\r\nexistence possible,--of that no one thinks. Dr. Fock also demands the\r\ntaxing of the prostitutes, and their concentration in given streets. In\r\nother words, the Christian State is to procure for itself a revenue out\r\nof prostitution, and, at the same time, organize and place prostitution\r\nunder its protection for the benefit of male creation. What was it that\r\nthe Emperor Vespasian said at a somewhat similar juncture? \"_Non\r\nolet!_\"--it smells not.\r\n\r\nDid we exaggerate when we said: Prostitution is to-day a necessary\r\nsocial institution just as the police, standing armies, the Church and\r\nwage-mastership?\r\n\r\nIn the German Empire, prostitution is not, like in France, organized and\r\nsuperintended by the State; it is only tolerated. Official public houses\r\nare forbidden by law, and procuring is severely punishable. But that\r\ndoes not prevent that in a large number of German cities public houses\r\ncontinue to exist, and are winked at by the police. This establishes an\r\nincomprehensible state of things. The defiance of the law implied in\r\nsuch a state of things dawned even upon our statesmen and they bestirred\r\nthemselves to remove the objection by legislative enactments. The German\r\nCriminal Code makes also the lodging of a prostitute a penal offense. On\r\nthe other hand, however, the police are compelled to tolerate thousands\r\nof women as prostitutes, and, in a measure, to privilege them in their\r\ntrade, provided they enter themselves as prostitutes on the Police\r\nRegister, and submit to the Police regulations,--for instance,\r\nperiodically recurring examinations by a physician. It follows, however,\r\nthat, if the Government licenses the prostitute, and thereby protects\r\nthe exercise of her trade, she must also have a habitation. Aye, it is\r\neven in the interest of public health and order that they have such a\r\nplace to ply their trade in. What contradictions! On the one hand, the\r\nGovernment officially acknowledges that prostitution is necessary; on\r\nthe other, it prosecutes and punishes the prostitute and the pimp. But\r\nit is out of contradictions that bourgeois society is put together.\r\nMoreover, the attitude of the Government is an avowal that prostitution\r\nis a Sphinx to modern society, the riddle which society can not solve:\r\nit considers necessary to tolerate and superintend prostitution in order\r\nto avoid greater evils. In other words, our social system, so boastful\r\nof its morality, its religiousness, its civilization and its culture,\r\nfeels compelled to tolerate that immorality and corruption spread\r\nthrough its body like a stealthy poison. But this state of things\r\nbetrays something else, besides _the admission by the Christian State\r\nthat marriage is insufficient, and that the husband has the right to\r\ndemand illegitimate gratification of his sexual instincts_. Woman counts\r\nwith such a State in so far only as she is willing, as a sexual being,\r\nto yield to illegitimate male desires, i. e., become a prostitute. In\r\nkeeping herewith, the supervision and control, exercised by the organs\r\nof the State over the registered prostitutes, do not fall upon the men\r\nalso, those who seek the prostitute. Such a provision would be a matter\r\nof course if the sanitary police control was to be of any sense, and\r\neven of partial effect,--apart from the circumstance that a sense of\r\njustice would demand an even-handed application of the law to both\r\nsexes. No; \"supervision and control\" fall upon woman alone.\r\n\r\nThis protection by the State of man and not woman, turns upside down the\r\nnature of things. _It looks as if men were the weaker vessel and women\r\nthe stronger; as if woman were the seducer, and poor, weak man the\r\nseduced._ The seduction-myth between Adam and Eve in Paradise continues\r\nto operate in our opinions and laws, and it says to Christianity: \"You\r\nare right; woman is the arch seductress, the vessel of iniquity.\" Men\r\nshould be ashamed of such a sorry and unworthy _role_; but this _role_\r\nof the \"weak\" and the \"seduced\" suits them;--_the more they are\r\nprotected, all the more may they sin_.\r\n\r\nWherever men assemble in large numbers, they seem unable to amuse\r\nthemselves without prostitution. This was shown, among other instances\r\nof the kind, by the occurrences at the German Schuetzenfest, held in\r\nBerlin in the summer of 1890, which caused 2,300 women to express\r\nthemselves as follows in a petition addressed to the Mayor of the German\r\ncapital: \"May it please your Honor to allow us to bring to your\r\nknowledge the matters that have reached the provinces, through the\r\npress and other means of communication, upon the German shooting\r\nmatches, held at Pankow from the 6th to the 13th of July of this year.\r\nThe reports of the matter, that we have seen with indignation and\r\nhorror, represent the programme of that festival with the following\r\nannouncements, among others: 'First German Herald, the Greatest\r\nSongstress of the World;' 'A Hundred Ladies and Forty Gentlemen:'\r\nBesides these smaller _cafes chantants_ and shooting galleries, in which\r\nimportunate women forced themselves upon the men. Also a 'free concert,'\r\nwhose gaily-clad waitresses, seductively smiling, brazenly and\r\nshamelessly invited the gymnasium students and the fathers of families,\r\nthe youths and the grown men alike, to the 'shooting retreats.'... The\r\nbarely dressed 'lady' who invited people to the booth of 'The Secrets of\r\nHamburg, or a Night in St. Pauli,' should have been enough to justify\r\nher removal by the police. And then the shocking announcement, almost\r\nincredible of the much boasted about Imperial capital, and hardly to be\r\nbelieved by plain male and female citizens in the provinces, to the\r\neffect that the managers of the festival had consented to the\r\nemployment, without pay, of 'young women' in large numbers, as\r\nbar-maids, instead of the waiters who applied for work.... We, German\r\nwomen, have thousands of occasions, as wives, mothers and as sisters, to\r\nsend our husbands, children, daughters and brothers to Berlin in the\r\nservice of the fatherland; we, consequently, pray to your Honor in all\r\nhumbleness and in the confident expectation that, with the aid of the\r\noverpowering influence, which, as the chief magistrate of the Imperial\r\ncapital, lies in your hand, you may institute such investigations of\r\nthose disgraceful occurrences, or adopt such other measures as to your\r\nHonor may seem fit, to the end that a recurrence of those orgies may not\r\nhave to be apprehended at the pending Sedan festival, for instance....\"\r\n(!!)\r\n\r\nDuring the session of the Reichstag, from 1892 to 1893, the united\r\nGovernments made an effort to put an end to the contradiction that\r\ngovernmental practice, on the one hand, and the Criminal Code on the\r\nother, find themselves in with regard to prostitution. They introduced a\r\nbill that was to empower the police to designate certain habitations to\r\nprostitutes. It was admitted that prostitution could not be suppressed,\r\nand that, therefore, the most practical thing was to tolerate the thing\r\nin certain localities, and to control it. The bill--upon that all minds\r\nwere agreed--would, if it became a law, have called again to life the\r\nbrothels that were officially abolished in Prussia about 1845. The bill\r\ncaused a great uproar, and it evoked a number of protests in which the\r\nwarning was raised against the State's setting itself up as the\r\nprotector of prostitution, and thereby favoring the idea that the use of\r\nprostitution was not in violation of good morals, or that the trade of\r\nthe prostitute was such that the State could allow and approve of. The\r\nbill, which met with the strongest opposition both on the floor of the\r\nReichstag and in the committee, was pigeon-holed, and dared not again\r\ncome into daylight. That, nevertheless, such a bill could at all take\r\nshape reveals the embarrassment that society is in.\r\n\r\nThe administrative regulation of prostitution raises in the minds of men\r\nnot only the belief that the State allows the use of prostitution, but\r\nalso that such control protects them against disease. Indeed, this\r\nbelief greatly promotes indulgence and recklessness on the part of men.\r\nBrothels do not reduce sexual diseases, they promote the same: _the men\r\ngrow more careless and less cautious_.\r\n\r\nExperience has taught that neither the establishment of houses of\r\nprostitution, controlled by the police, nor the supervision and medical\r\ninspection, ordered by the police, afford the slightest guarantee\r\nagainst contagion. The nature of these diseases is frequently such that\r\nthey are not to be easily or immediately detected. If there is to be any\r\nsafety, the inspection would have to be held several times a day. That,\r\nhowever, is impossible in view of the number of women concerned, and\r\nalso of the costs. Where thirty or forty prostitutes must be \"done\" in\r\nan hour, inspection is hardly more than a farce; moreover, one or two\r\ninspections a week is wholly inadequate. The success of these measures\r\nalso suffers shipwreck in the circumstance that the men, who transmit\r\nthe germs of disease from one woman to another, remain free from all\r\nofficial annoyance. A prostitute, just inspected and found healthy, may\r\nbe infected that same hour by a diseased man, and she transmits the\r\nvirus to other patrons, until the next inspection day, or until she has\r\nherself become aware of the disease. The control is not only illusory:\r\nThese inspections, made at command, and conducted by male, instead of\r\nfemale physicians, hurt most deeply the sense of shame; and they\r\ncontribute to its total ruination. This is a phenomenon confirmed by\r\nmany physicians. Even the official report of the Berlin Police\r\nDepartment admits the fact by stating: \"It may also be granted that\r\n_registration causes the moral sense of the prostitute to sink_ still\r\nlower.\"[104] Accordingly, the prostitutes try their utmost to escape\r\nthis control. A further consequence of these police measures is that\r\nthey make it extraordinarily difficult, even impossible, for the\r\nprostitute ever again to return to a decent trade. _A woman, that has\r\nfallen under police control, is lost to society; she generally goes down\r\nin misery within a few years._ Accurately and exhaustively did the fifth\r\nCongress at Geneva for Combatting Immorality utter itself against the\r\npolice regulation of prostitutes, by declaring: \"The compulsory medical\r\ninspection of prostitutes is an all the more cruel punishment to the\r\nwoman, seeing that, by destroying the remnants of shame, still possible\r\nwithin even the most abandoned, such inspection drags down completely\r\ninto depravity the wretched being that is subjected thereto. The State,\r\nthat means to regulate prostitution with the police, forgets that it\r\nowes equal protection to both sexes; it demoralizes and degrades women.\r\nEvery system for the official regulation of prostitution has police\r\narbitrariness for its consequence, as well as the violation of civic\r\nguaranties that are safeguarded to every individual, even to the\r\ngreatest criminal, against arbitrary arrest and imprisonment. Seeing\r\nthis violation of right is exercised to the injury of woman only, the\r\nconsequence is an inequality, shocking to nature, between her and man.\r\nWoman is degraded to the level of a mere means, and is no longer treated\r\nas a person. _She is placed outside of the pale of law._\"\r\n\r\nOf how little use police control is, England furnishes a striking\r\nillustration. In the year 1866 a law was enacted on the subject for\r\nplaces in which soldiers and marines were garrisoned. Now, then, while\r\nfrom 1860 to 1866, without the law, the lighter cases of syphilis had\r\ndeclined from 32.68 to 24.73 per cent., after a six years' enforcement\r\nof the new law, the percentage of diseased in 1872 was still 24.26. In\r\nother words, it was not one-half per cent. lower in 1872 than in 1866;\r\nbut the average for these six years was 1-16 per cent. higher than in\r\n1866. In sight of this, a special Commission, appointed in 1873, to\r\ninvestigate the effect of that law, arrived at the unanimous conclusion\r\nthat \"the periodical inspection of the women who usually have sexual\r\nintercourse with the _personnel_ of the army and navy, _had, at best,\r\nnot occasioned the slightest diminution in the number of cases_,\" and it\r\n_recommended the suspension_ of periodical inspections.\r\n\r\nThe effects of the Act of Inspection on the women subjected thereto\r\nwere, however, quite different from those on the troops. In 1866, there\r\nwere, to every 1,000 prostitutes, 121 diseases; in 1868, after the law\r\nhad been in force two years, there were 202. The number then gradually\r\ndropped, but, nevertheless, still exceeded in 1874 the figure for 1866\r\nby 16 cases. Under the Act, deaths also increased frightfully among the\r\nprostitutes. In 1865 the proportion was 9.8 to every 1,000 prostitutes,\r\nwhereas, in 1874 it had risen to 23. When, towards the close of the\r\nsixties, the English Government made the attempt to extend the Act of\r\nInspection to all English cities, a storm of indignation arose from the\r\nwomen. The law was considered an affront to the whole sex. The Habeas\r\nCorpus Act,--that fundamental law, that protects the English citizen\r\nagainst police usurpation--would, such was the sentiment, be suspended\r\nfor women: any brutal policeman, animated by revenge or any other base\r\nmotive, would be free to seize any decent woman on the suspicion of her\r\nbeing a prostitute, whereas the licentiousness of the men would remain\r\nunmolested, aye, would be protected and fed, by just such a law.\r\n\r\nAlthough this intervention in behalf of the outcasts of their sex\r\nreadily exposed the English women to misrepresentation and degrading\r\nremarks from the quarter of narrow-minded men, the women did not allow\r\nthemselves to be held back from energetically opposing the introduction\r\nof the law that was an insult to their sex. In newspaper articles and\r\npamphlets the \"pros\" and \"cons\" were discussed by men and women; in\r\nParliament, the extension of the law was, first, prevented; its repeal\r\nfollowed later. The German police is vested with a similar power, and\r\ncases that have forced themselves into publicity from Berlin, Leipsic\r\nand other cities, prove that its abuse--or be it \"mistakes\" in its\r\nexercise--is easy; nevertheless, of an energetic opposition to such\r\nregulations naught is heard. Even in middle class Norway, brothels were\r\nforbidden in 1884; in 1888 the compulsory registration of the\r\nprostitutes and the inspection connected therewith were abolished in the\r\ncapital, Christiania; and in January, 1893, the enactment was made\r\ngeneral for the whole country. Very rightly does Mrs. Guillaume-Schack\r\nremark upon the \"protective\" measures adopted by the State in behalf of\r\nthe men: \"To what end do we teach our sons to respect virtue and\r\nmorality if the State pronounces immorality a necessary evil; and if,\r\nbefore the young man has at all reached mental maturity, the State leads\r\nwoman to him stamped by the authorities as a merchandise, as a toy for\r\nhis passion?\"\r\n\r\nLet a sexually diseased man, in his unbridled career of licentiousness,\r\ncontaminate ever so many of these poor beings--who, to the honor of\r\nwoman be it said, are mostly driven by bitter want or through seduction\r\nto ply their disgraceful trade,--the scurvy fellow remains unmolested.\r\nBut woe to the woman who does not forthwith submit to inspection and\r\ntreatment! The garrison cities, university towns, etc., with their\r\ncongestion of vigorous, healthy men, are the chief centers of\r\nprostitution and of its dangerous diseases, that are carried thence into\r\nthe remotest corners of the land, and everywhere spread infection. The\r\nsame holds with the sea towns. What the moral qualifications are with a\r\nlarge number of our students the following utterance in a publication\r\nfor the promotion of morality may give an idea of: \"_With by far the\r\nlarger number of students, the views entertained upon matters of\r\nmorality are shockingly low, aye, they are downright unclean._\"[105] And\r\nthese are the circles--boastful of their \"German breed,\" and \"German\r\nmorals\"--from which our administrative officers, our District Attorneys\r\nand our Judges are in part recruited.\r\n\r\n\"Thy sins shall be visited upon the children unto the third and fourth\r\ngeneration.\" This Bible sentence falls upon the dissipated and sexually\r\ndiseased man in the fullest sense of the word, unhappily also upon the\r\ninnocent woman. \"Attacks of apoplexy with young men and also women,\r\nseveral manifestations of spinal debility and softening of the brains,\r\nall manner of nervous diseases, affections of the eyes, cariosity,\r\ninflammation of the intestines, sterility and atrophy, _frequently\r\nproceed from nothing else than chronic and neglected, and, often for\r\nspecial reasons, concealed syphilis_.... As things now are, ignorance\r\nand lightheadedness also contribute towards _turning blooming daughters\r\nof the land into anaemic, listless creatures_, who, under the burden of\r\na chronic inflammation of the pelvis, _have to atone for the excesses\r\ncommitted by their husbands before and after marriage_.\"[106] In the\r\nsame sense does Dr. Blaschke utter himself:[107] \"Epidemics like cholera\r\nand smallpox, diphtheria and typhus, whose visible effects are, by\r\nreason of their suddenness, realized by all, although hardly equal to\r\nsyphilis in point of virulence, and, in point of diffusion, not to be\r\ncompared therewith, yet are they the terror of the population ... while\r\nbefore syphilis society stands, one feels inclined to say, with\r\nfrightful indifference.\" The fault lies in the circumstance that it is\r\nconsidered \"improper\" to talk openly of such things. Did not even the\r\nGerman Reichstag stop short before a resolution to provide by law that\r\nsexual diseases, as well as all others, shall be treated by Sick-Benefit\r\nAssociations?\r\n\r\nThe syphilitic virus is in its effects the most tenacious and hardest\r\npoison to stamp out. Many years after an outbreak has been overcome, and\r\nthe patient believes every trace to be wiped out, the sequels frequently\r\ncrop up afresh in the wife or the new-born child;[108] and a swarm of\r\nailments among wives and children trace their causes back, respectively,\r\nto marital and parental venereal diseases. With some who are born blind,\r\nthe misfortune is due to the father's sins, the consequences of which\r\ntransmitted themselves to the wife, and from her to the child.\r\nWeak-minded and idiotic children may frequently ascribe their infirmity\r\nto the same cause. Finally, what dire disaster may be achieved through\r\nvaccination by an insignificant drop of syphilitic blood, our own days\r\ncan furnish crass illustrations of.\r\n\r\nIn the measure that men, willingly or otherwise, renounce marriage, and\r\nseek the gratification of natural impulses through illegitimate\r\nchannels, seductive allurements increase also. The great profits yielded\r\nby all undertakings that cater to immorality, attract numerous and\r\nunscrupulous business men, who spare no artifice of refinement to draw\r\nand keep customers. Account is taken of every demand, according to the\r\nrank and position of the custom, also of its means and readiness to\r\nbleed. If some of these \"public houses\" in our large cities were to blab\r\nout their secrets, the fact would appear that their female\r\ntenants--mostly of low extraction, without either culture or education,\r\noften unable to write their own names, but possessed of all the mere\r\nphysical charms--stand in the most intimate relations with \"leaders of\r\nsociety,\" with men of high intelligence and culture. There would be\r\nfound among these Cabinet Ministers, high military dignitaries,\r\nCouncillors, members of Legislatures, Judges, etc., going in and out,\r\nand side by side with representatives of the aristocracy of birth, of\r\nfinance, of commerce and of industry,--all of them, who, by day and in\r\nsociety, strut about with grave and dignified mien as \"representatives\r\nand guardians of morality, of order, of marriage, and of the family,\"\r\nand who stand at the head of the Christian charity societies and of\r\nsocieties for the \"suppression of prostitution.\" Modern capitalist\r\nsociety resembles a huge carnival festival, at which all seek to deceive\r\nand fool one another. Each carries his official disguise with dignity,\r\nin order later, unofficially and with all the less restraint, to give a\r\nloose to his inclinations and passions. All the while, public life is\r\nrunning over with \"Morality,\" \"Religion\" and \"Propriety.\" In no age was\r\nthere greater hypocrisy than in ours. The number of the augurs swells\r\ndaily.\r\n\r\nThe supply of women for purposes of lust rises even more rapidly than\r\nthe demand. Our increasingly precarious social conditions--want,\r\nseduction, the love for an externally brilliant and apparently easy\r\nlife--furnish the female candidates from all social strata. Quite\r\ntypically does a novel of Hans Wachenhusen[109] depict the state of\r\nthings in the capital of the German Empire. The author expresses himself\r\non the purpose of his work in these words: \"My book deals mainly with\r\nthe victims of the female sex and its steady depreciation, due to the\r\nunnatural plight of our social and civic state, through its own fault,\r\nthrough neglect of education, through the craving of luxury and the\r\nincreasing light-headed supply in the market of life. It speaks of this\r\nsex's increasing surplus, which renders daily more hopeless the new-born\r\nones, more prospectless those that grow up.... I wrote much in the same\r\nway as the District Attorney puts together the past life of a criminal,\r\nin order to establish therefrom the measure of his guilt. Novels being\r\ngenerally considered works of fiction, permissible opposites of Truth,\r\nthe following is, in that sense, no novel, but a true picture of life,\r\nwithout coloring.\" In Berlin, things are no better and no worse than in\r\nother large cities. Whether Greek-Orthodox St. Petersburg or Catholic\r\nRome, Germanic-Christian Berlin or heathen Paris, puritanic London or\r\ngay Vienna, approach nearer to Babylon of old is hard to decide.\r\n\"Prostitution possesses its written and its unwritten laws, its\r\nresources, its various resorts, from the poorest cottage to the most\r\nsplendid palace, its numberless grades from the lowest to the most\r\nrefined and cultivated; it has its special amusements and public places\r\nof meeting, its police, its hospitals, its prisons and its\r\nliterature.\"[110] \"We no longer celebrate the festival of Osiris, the\r\nBacchanalia and the Indian orgies of the spring month; but in Paris and\r\nother large cities, under the black cloak of night, behind the walls of\r\n'public' and 'private' houses, people give themselves over to orgies and\r\nBacchanalia that the boldest pen dare not describe.\"[111]\r\n\r\nUnder such conditions, the traffic in female flesh has assumed mammoth\r\nproportions. It is conducted on a most extensive scale, and is most\r\nadmirably organized in the very midst of the seats of civilization and\r\nculture, rarely attracting the notice of the police. A swarm of brokers,\r\nagents, carriers, male and female, ply the trade with the same unconcern\r\nas if they dealt in any other merchandise. Birth certificates are\r\nforged, and bills of lading are drawn up with accurate descriptions of\r\nthe qualifications of the several \"articles,\" and are handed over to the\r\ncarriers as directions for the purchasers. As with all merchandise, the\r\nprice depends upon the quality, and the several categories are assorted\r\nand consigned, according to the taste and the requirements of the\r\ncustomers in different places and countries. The slyest manipulations\r\nare resorted to in order to evade the snares and escape the vigilance of\r\nthe police; not infrequently large sums are used to shut the eyes of the\r\nguardians of the law. A number of such cases have been established,\r\nespecially in Paris.\r\n\r\nGermany enjoys the sorry fame of being the woman market for half the\r\nworld. The innate German migratory disposition seems to animate also a\r\nportion of the women. In larger numbers than those of any other people,\r\nthe Austrian excepted, do they furnish their contingent to the supply of\r\ninternational prostitution. German women populate the harems of the\r\nTurks, as well as the public houses of central Siberia, and as far away\r\nas Bombay, Singapore, San Francisco and Chicago. In a book of\r\ntravels,[112] the author, W. Joest, speaks as follows on the German\r\ntrade in girls: \"People so often grow warm in our moral Germany over\r\nthe slave trade that some African negro Prince may be carrying on, or\r\nover conditions in Cuba and Brazil, but they should rather keep in mind\r\nthe beam in their own eyes: _in no country is there such a trade with\r\nwhite female slaves, from no country is the export of this living\r\nmerchandise as large as it is from Germany and Austria_. The road that\r\nthese girls take can be accurately followed. From Hamburg they are\r\nshipped to South America; Bahia and Rio de Janeiro receive their quotas;\r\nthe largest part is destined for Montevideo and Buenos Ayres, while a\r\nsmall rest goes through the Straits of Magellan as far as Valparaiso.\r\nAnother stream is steered via England, or direct to North America,\r\nwhere, however, it can hold its own only with difficulty against the\r\ndomestic product, and, consequently, splits up down the Mississippi as\r\nfar as New Orleans and Texas, or westward to California. Thence, the\r\ncoast is supplied as far south as Panama; while Cuba, the West Indies\r\nand Mexico draw their supplies from New Orleans. Under the title of\r\n\"Bohemians,\" further droves of German girls are exported over the Alps\r\nto Italy and thence further south to Alexandria, Suez, Bombay, Calcutta\r\nand Singapore, aye, even to Hongkong and as far as Shanghai. The Dutch\r\nIndies and Eastern Asia, Japan, especially, are poor markets, seeing\r\nthat Holland does not allow white girls of this kind in its colonies,\r\nwhile in Japan the daughters of the soil are themselves too pretty and\r\ncheap. American competition from San Francisco also tends to spoil the\r\notherwise favorable chances. Russia is provided from East Prussia,\r\nPomerania and Poland. The first station is usually Riga. Here the\r\ndealers from St. Petersburg and Moscow supply themselves, and ship their\r\ngoods in large quantities to Nischni-Novgorod and beyond the Ural\r\nMountains to Irbit and Krestofsky, aye as far as the interior of\r\nSiberia. I found, for instance, a German girl in Tschita who had been\r\ntraded in this way. This wonderful trade is thoroughly organized, it is\r\nattended to by agents and commercial travelers. _If ever the Foreign\r\nDepartment of the German Empire were to demand of its consuls reports on\r\nthis matter, quite interesting statistical tables could be put\r\ntogether._\"\r\n\r\nThis trade flourishes to this day at its fullest, as proved in the\r\nautumn of 1893 by a Social Democratic delegate to the German Reichstag.\r\n\r\nThe number of prostitutes is hard to estimate; accurately it can not be\r\nat all given. The police can state approximately the number of women\r\nwhose principal occupation is prostitution; but it can not do this with\r\nregard to the much larger number of those who resort to it as a side\r\nmeans of income. All the same, the figures approximately known are\r\nfrightfully high. According to v. Oettingen, the number of prostitutes\r\nin London was, as early as the close of the sixties, estimated at\r\n80,000. In Paris the number of registered prostitutes in 1892 was 4,700,\r\nbut fully one-third escape police control. In all Paris, there were, in\r\n1892, about sixty brothels, with 600 to 700 prostitutes, and the number\r\nof brothels is steadily on the decline. On the other hand, based upon an\r\ninvestigation, instituted by the Municipal Council of Paris, in 1889,\r\nthe number of women who prostitute themselves is placed at the enormous\r\nfigure of 120,000. In Berlin, the number of prostitutes, registered with\r\nthe police, was:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    1886  3,006\r\n    1887  3,063\r\n    1888  3,392\r\n    1889  3,703\r\n    1890  4,039\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1890, there were six physicians employed, whose duty it was to devote\r\ntwo hours a day to inspection.[113] Since then the number of physicians\r\nhas been increased. The prostitutes, registered with the police,\r\nconstitute, however, in Berlin also, only a very small portion of the\r\ntotal. Expert sources estimate it at not less than 50,000. In the year\r\n1890 alone, there were in 9,024 liquor saloons 2,022 bar-maids, almost\r\nall of whom yield to prostitution. Furthermore, the, from year to year,\r\nrising number of girls, arrested for disorderly conduct, shows that\r\nprostitution in Berlin is steadily on the increase. The numbers of these\r\narrests were:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    1881  10,878\r\n    1884  11,157\r\n    1887  13,358\r\n    1890  16,605\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the 16,605 girls, arrested in 1890, there were 9,162 carried for\r\nsentence before the Judge. There were, accordingly, 30 of these at every\r\nsession of the court, and 128 of them were placed under the police by\r\njudicial decree. Already in 1860, it was calculated in Hamburg that\r\nevery ninth woman was a prostitute. Since then the proportion has become\r\ngreatly worse.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, the number of prostitutes probably runs up to 180,000.\r\nAccordingly, we here have to do with a large female army, that considers\r\nprostitution as a means of livelihood; and the number of victims, whom\r\ndisease and death claim, is in proportion.[114]\r\n\r\nTait calculates for Edinburg that the average life of the prostitute is\r\n22 to 25 years. According to him, year in and year out, _every fourth\r\naye, every third prostitute seeks to take her own life, and every\r\ntwelfth actually succeeds in killing herself_. A truly shocking state of\r\nthings. The majority of prostitutes are heartily tired of their way of\r\nliving; aye, that they are disgusted thereat, is an experience admitted\r\nby all experts. But once fallen into prostitution, only to very few is\r\nthe opportunity ever offered to escape.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the number of prostitutes increases in the same measure that\r\ndoes that of the women engaged as female labor in the various branches\r\nof industry and trade, and that are paid off with wages that are too\r\nhigh to die, and too low to live on. Prostitution is, furthermore,\r\npromoted by the industrial crises that have become a necessity of the\r\ncapitalist world, that commence to become chronic, and that carry want\r\nand misery into hundreds and thousands of families. According to a\r\nletter of the Chief Constable of Bolton, October 31, 1865, to a Factory\r\nInspector, the number of young prostitutes had increased more during the\r\nEnglish cotton famine, consequent upon the North American war for the\r\nemancipation of the slaves, than during the previous twenty-five\r\nyears.[115] But it is not only the working-women, who, through want,\r\nfall a prey to prostitution. Prostitution also finds its recruiting\r\ngrounds in the higher walks of life. Lombroso and Ferrero quote\r\nMace,[116] who says of Paris that \"a governess certificate, whether of\r\nhigh or low degree, is not so much a draft upon bread, _as upon suicide,\r\ntheft and prostitution_.\"\r\n\r\nParent-Duchatelet made out in his time a statistical table, according to\r\nwhich, out of 5,000 prostitutes there were 1,440 who took to the\r\noccupation out of want and misery; 1,250 were orphaned and without\r\nsupport; 80 prostituted themselves in order to feed poor parents; 1,400\r\nwere concubines left by their keepers; 400 were girls whom officers and\r\nsoldiers had seduced and dragged to Paris; 280 had been deserted by\r\ntheir lovers during pregnancy. These figures speak for themselves. They\r\nneed no further explanation. Mrs. Butler, the zealous champion of the\r\npoorest and most wretched of her sex in England, says on the subject of\r\nprostitution: \"Fortuitous circumstances, the death of a father, of a\r\nmother, lack of work, insufficient wages, misery, false promises,\r\nsnares, have led them to sin.\" Instructive also is the information given\r\nby K. Schneidt[117] on the causes, that lead the Berlin bar-maids so\r\noften into the arms of prostitution. Shockingly large is the number of\r\nfemale servants that become barmaids, and that almost always means\r\nprostitutes. The answers that Schneidt received on his schedules of\r\nquestions addressed to bar-maids, ran like this: \"Because I got a child\r\nfrom my master and had to earn my living;\" or \"Because my book was\r\nspoiled;\" or \"Because with sewing shirts and the like too little is\r\nmade;\" or \"Because I was discharged from the factory and could get no\r\nmore work;\" or \"Because my father died, and there were four other little\r\nones.\" That, particularly, servant girls, after they fall a prey to\r\nseduction by their masters, furnish a large contingent to the\r\nprostitutes, is a known fact. On the subject of the shockingly large\r\nnumber of seductions of servant girls by their masters or by the sons of\r\nthese, Dr. Max Taude expresses himself reproachfully.[118] When,\r\nhowever, the upper classes furnish their quota to prostitution, it is\r\nnot want but seduction and the inclination for an easy life, for dress\r\nand for pleasures. On that subject a certain work[119] utters itself\r\nthis wise:\r\n\r\n\"Cold with horror and dismay, many a staid citizen, many a parson,\r\nteacher, high official, high military dignitary, etc., learns that his\r\ndaughter has secretly taken to prostitution. _Were it allowable to\r\nmention all these daughters by name, either a social revolution would\r\ntake place on the spot, or the popular ideas concerning honor and virtue\r\nwould be seriously damaged._\"\r\n\r\nIt is especially the finer prostitutes, the _haute volee_ among the\r\nprostitutes, that are recruited from these circles. Likewise do a large\r\nportion of actresses, whose wardrobe outlays alone stand in crass\r\ndisproportion to their salaries, depend upon such unclean sources of\r\nrevenue.[120] The same with numerous girls, engaged as sales-ladies, and\r\nin similar capacities. There are employers dishonorable enough to\r\njustify the low wages that they pay by referring their female employes\r\nto the aid of \"friends.\" For instance: In 1889 the \"Sachsische Arbeiter\r\nZeitung\" of Dresden published a notice that ran as follows: \"A cultured\r\nyoung lady, long time out of work on account of lung troubles, looked,\r\nupon her recovery, for work of any sort. She was a governess. Nothing\r\nfit offered itself quickly, and she decided to accept the first job that\r\ncame along, whatever it was. She first applied to Mr. ----. Seeing she\r\nspoke readily several languages, she was acceptable; but the 30 marks a\r\nmonth wages seemed to her too small to get along with. She stated to Mr.\r\n----, and his answer was that most of his girls did not get even that\r\nmuch, but from 15 to 20 marks at most, and they all pulled through quite\r\nwell, each having a 'good friend,' who helped along. Another gentleman,\r\nMr. ----, expressed himself in the same sense. Of course, the lady\r\naccepted a place in neither of the two establishments.\"\r\n\r\nSeamstresses, female tailors, milliners, factory girls by the hundreds\r\nof thousands find themselves in similar plight. Employers and their\r\nsubalterns--merchants, mill owners, landlords, etc.,--who keep female\r\nhands and employes, frequently consider it a sort of privilege to find\r\nthese women handy to administer to their lusts. Our pious and\r\nconservative folks love to represent the rural districts as truly\r\nidyllic in point of morality, compared with the large cities and\r\nindustrial centers. Everyone acquainted with the actual state of things\r\nknows that it is not so; and the fact was evidenced by the address,\r\ndelivered by a baronial landlord of Saxony in the fall of 1889, reported\r\nas follows in the papers of the place:\r\n\r\n\"GRIMMA.--Baron Dr. v. Waechter of Roecknitz, recently delivered an\r\naddress, before a diocese meeting that took place here, upon the subject\r\nof 'Sexual Immorality in Our Rural Communities.' Local conditions were\r\nnot presented by him in a rosy color. The speaker admitted with great\r\ncandor that _employers_, even _married_ ones, are frequently in _very\r\nintimate relations_ with their female domestics, the consequences of\r\nwhich were either cancelled with _cash_, or were removed from the eyes\r\nof the world through a _crime_. The fact could, unfortunately, not be\r\ncloaked over, that immorality was nursed in these communities, not alone\r\nby girls, who, as nurses in cities, had taken in the poison, or by\r\nfellows, who made its acquaintance in the military service, but that,\r\nsad to say, also the _cultured classes_, through the stewards of\r\nmanorial estates, and through the officers on the occasions of field\r\nmanoeuvres, carried lax principles of morality into the country\r\ndistricts. According to Dr. v. Waechter, there are _actually here in the\r\ncountry few girls who reach the age of seventeen_ without having\r\nfallen.\" The open-hearted speaker's love of truth was answered with a\r\nsocial boycott, placed upon him by the officers who felt insulted. The\r\n_jus primae noctis_ of the medieval feudal lord continues in another\r\nform in these very days of ours.\r\n\r\nThe majority of prostitutes are thrown into the arms of this occupation\r\nat a time when they can hardly be said to have arrived at the age of\r\ndiscretion. Of 2,582 girls, arrested in Paris for the secret practice of\r\nprostitution, 1,500 were minors; of 607 others, 487 had been deflowered\r\nunder the age of twenty. In September, 1894, a scandal of first rank\r\ntook the stage in Buda-Pest. It appeared that about 400 girls of from\r\ntwelve to fifteen years fell prey to a band of rich rakes. The sons of\r\nour \"property and cultured classes\" generally consider it an attribute\r\nof their rank to seduce the daughters of the people, whom they then\r\nleave in the lurch. Only too readily do the trustful daughters of the\r\npeople, untutored in life and experience, and generally joyless and\r\nfriendless, fall a prey to the seduction that approaches them in\r\nbrilliant and seductive guise. Disillusion, then sorrows, finally\r\ncrime,--such are the sequels. Of 1,846,171 live births in Germany in\r\n1891, 172,456 were illegitimate. Only conjure up the volume of worry and\r\nheartaches prepared for a great number of these mothers, by the birth of\r\ntheir illegitimate children, even if allowance is made for the many\r\ninstances when the children are legitimatized by their fathers! _Suicide\r\nby women and infanticide_ are to a large extent traceable to the\r\ndestitution and wretchedness in which the women are left when deserted.\r\nThe trials for child murder cast a dark and instructive picture upon the\r\ncanvas. To cite just one case, in the fall of 1894, a young girl, who,\r\neight days after her delivery, had been turned out of the lying-in\r\ninstitute in Vienna and thrown upon the streets with her child and\r\nwithout means, and who, in her distress and desperation, killed the\r\ninfant, _was sentenced to be hanged_ by a jury of Krems in Lower\r\nAustria. About the scamp of a father nothing was said. And how often do\r\nnot similar instances occur! The seduced and outrageously deserted\r\nwoman, cast helpless into the abyss of despair and shame, resorts to\r\nextreme measures: she kills the fruit of her womb, is dragged before the\r\ntribunals, is sentenced to penitentiary or the gallows. The\r\nunconscionable, and actual murderer,--he goes off scott-free; marries,\r\nperchance, shortly after, the daughter of a \"respectable and honest\"\r\nfamily, and becomes a much honored, upright man. There is many a\r\ngentleman, floating about in honors and distinctions, who has soiled his\r\nhonor and his conscience in this manner. Had women a word to say in\r\nlegislation, much would be otherwise in this direction.\r\n\r\nMost cruel of all, as already indicated, is the posture of French\r\nlegislation, which forbids inquiry after the child's paternity, and,\r\ninstead, sets up foundling asylums. The resolution on the subject, by\r\nthe Convention of June 28, 1793, runs thus: \"The nation takes charge of\r\nthe physical and moral education of abandoned children. From that moment\r\nthey will be designated only by the term of orphans. No other\r\ndesignation shall be allowed.\" Quite convenient for the men, who,\r\nthereby, shifted the obligation of the individual upon the collectivity,\r\nto the end of escaping exposure before the public and their wives. In\r\nall the provinces of the land, orphan and foundling asylums were set up.\r\nThe number of orphans and foundlings ran up, in 1893, to 130,945, of\r\nwhich it was estimated that each tenth child was legitimate, but not\r\nwanted by its parents. But no particular care was taken of these\r\nchildren, and the mortality among them was, accordingly, great. In that\r\nyear, fully 59 per cent., i. e., more than one-half died during the\r\nfirst year of their lives; 78 per cent. died twelve years of age and\r\nunder. Accordingly, of every 100 only 22 reached the age of twelve years\r\nand over. It is claimed that matters have in the meantime improved in\r\nthose establishments.\r\n\r\nIn Austria and Italy also foundling asylums were established, and their\r\nsupport assumed by the State. \"_Ici on fait mourir les enfants_\" (Here\r\nchildren are killed) is the inscription that a certain King is said to\r\nhave recommended as fit for foundling asylums. In Austria, they are\r\ngradually disappearing; there are now only eight of them left; also the\r\ntreatment and care of the children has considerably improved to what it\r\nwas. In 1888, there were 40,865 children cared for in Austria, including\r\nGalicia; of these 10,466 were placed in public institutions, 30,399\r\nunder private care, at a joint cost of 1,817,372 florins. Mortality was\r\nslighter among the children in the public institutions than among those\r\nplaced under private care. This was especially the case in Galicia.\r\nThere, 31.25 per cent. of the children died during the year 1888 in the\r\npublic establishments, by far more than in the public establishments of\r\nother countries; but of those under private care, 84.21 per cent.\r\ndied,--a veritable mass-assassination. It almost looks as though the\r\nPolish slaughterhouse system aimed at killing off these poor little\r\nworms as swiftly as possible. It is a generally accepted fact that the\r\npercentage of deaths among children born out of wedlock is far higher\r\nthan among those born in wedlock. In Prussia there died, early in the\r\nsixties, during the first year of their lives 18.23 per cent. of\r\nchildren born in wedlock, and 33.11 per cent. of children born out of\r\nwedlock, accordingly twice as many of the latter. In Paris there died,\r\n100 children born in wedlock to every 139 born out of wedlock, and in\r\nthe country districts 215. Italian statistics throw up this picture: Out\r\nof every 10,000 live-births, there died--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Legitimate children:    1881.  1882.  1883.  1884.  1885.\r\n      One month old           751    741    724    698    696\r\n      Two to twelve months  1,027  1,172    986    953  1,083\r\n    Illegitimate children:\r\n      One month old         2,092  2,045  2,139  2,107  1,813\r\n      Two to twelve months  1,387  1,386  1,437  1,437  1,353\r\n\r\n\r\nThe difference in the mortality between legitimate and illegitimate\r\nchildren is especially noticeable during the first month of life. During\r\nthat period, the mortality of children born out of wedlock is on an\r\naverage three times as large as that of those born in wedlock. Improper\r\nattention during pregnancy, weak delivery and poor care afterwards, are\r\nthe very simple causes. Likewise do maltreatment and the infamous\r\npractice and superstition of \"making angels\" increase the victims. The\r\nnumber of still-births is twice as large with illegitimate than with\r\nlegitimate children, due, probably, mainly to the efforts of some of the\r\nmothers to bring on the death of the child during pregnancy. The\r\nillegitimate children who survive revenge themselves upon society for\r\nthe wrong done them, by furnishing _an extraordinary large percentage of\r\ncriminals of all degrees_.\r\n\r\nYet another evil, frequently met, must also be shortly touched upon.\r\nExcessive sexual indulgence is infinitely more harmful than too little.\r\nA body, misused by excess, will go to pieces, even without venereal\r\ndiseases. Impotence, barrenness, spinal affections, insanity, at least\r\nintellectual weakness, and many other diseases, are the usual\r\nconsequences. _Temperance_ is as necessary in sexual intercourse as in\r\neating and drinking, and all other human wants. But temperance seems\r\ndifficult to youth. Hence the large number of \"young old men,\" in the\r\nhigher walks of life especially. The number of young and old _roues_ is\r\nenormous, and they require special irritants, excess having deadened and\r\nsurfeited them. Many, accordingly, lapse into the unnatural practices of\r\nGreek days. The crime against nature is to-day much more general than\r\nmost of us dream of: upon that subject the secret archives of many a\r\nPolice Bureau could publish frightful information. But not among men\r\nonly, among women also have the unnatural practices of old Greece come\r\nup again with force. Lesbian love, or Sapphism, is said to be quite\r\ngeneral among married women in Paris; according to Taxal,[121] it is\r\nenormously in practice among the prominent ladies of that city. In\r\nBerlin, one-fourth of the prostitutes are said to practice \"tribady;\"\r\nbut also in the circles of our leading dames there are not wanting\r\ndisciples of Sappho. Still another unnatural gratification of the sexual\r\ninstinct manifests itself in the violation of children, a practice that\r\nhas increased greatly during the last thirty years. In France, during\r\n1851-1875, 17,656 cases of this nature were tried. The colossal number\r\nof these crimes in France is intimately connected with the two-child\r\nsystem, and with the abstinence of husbands towards their wives. To the\r\nGerman population also we find people recommending Malthusianism,\r\nwithout stopping to think what the sequels will be. The so-called\r\n\"liberal professions,\" to whom belong mainly the members of the upper\r\nclasses, furnish in Germany about 5.6 per cent. of the ordinary\r\ncriminals, but they furnish 13 per cent. of the criminals indicted for\r\nviolation of children; and this latter percentage would be still higher\r\nwere there not in those circles ample means to screen the criminals, so\r\nthat, probably, the majority of cases remain undiscovered. The\r\nrevelations made in the eighties by the \"Pall Mall Gazette\" on the\r\nviolation of children in England, are still fresh in the public memory.\r\n\r\nThe moral progress of this our best of all possible worlds is recorded\r\nin the below tables for England, the \"leading country in civilization.\"\r\nIn England there were:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Immoral Acts    Deaths from\r\n     Year.          of Violence.     Syphilis.    Insane.\r\n    1861               280             1,345       39,647\r\n    1871               315             1,995       56,755\r\n    1881               370             2,334       73,113\r\n    1882               466             2,478       74,842\r\n    1883               390               ...       76,765\r\n    1884               510               ...          ...\r\n    Increase\r\n      since 1861    82 per cent.  84 per cent. 98 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nA frightful increase this is of the phenomena that point to the rising\r\nphysical and moral ruin of English society.\r\n\r\nThe best statistical record of venereal diseases and their increase is\r\nkept by Denmark, Copenhagen especially. Here venereal diseases, with\r\nspecial regard to syphilis, developed as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Venereal    Of these,\r\n     Year.    Population.   Diseases.   Syphilis.\r\n    1874        196,000       5,505        836\r\n    1879        227,000       6,299        934\r\n    1885        290,000       9,325      1,866\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the personnel of the navy in Copenhagen, the number of venereal\r\ndiseases increased 1224 per cent. during the period mentioned; in the\r\narmy and for the same period, 227 per cent.[122] And how stands it in\r\nParis? From the year 1872 to the year 1888, the number of persons\r\ntreated for venereal diseases in the hospitals Du Midi, de Lourcine and\r\nde St. Louis was 118,223, of which 60,438 suffered of syphilis and\r\n57,795 of other venereal affections. Besides these, of the number of\r\noutside persons, who applied to the clinics of the said three hospitals,\r\nthere was a yearly average of 16,385 venereals.[123]\r\n\r\nWe have seen how, as a result of our social conditions, vice, excesses,\r\nwrongs and crimes of all sorts are bred. All society is kept in a state\r\nof unrest. Under such a state of things woman is the chief sufferer.\r\n\r\nNumerous women realize this and seek redress. They demand, first of all,\r\neconomic self-support and independence; they demand that woman be\r\nadmitted, as well as man, to all pursuits that her physical and mental\r\npowers and faculties qualify her for; they demand, especially, admission\r\nto the occupations that are designated with the term \"liberal\r\nprofessions.\" Are the efforts in these directions justified? Are they\r\npractical? Would they mend matters? These are questions that now crowd\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[100] \"Geschichte, Statistik und Regelung der Prostitution in Wien.\"\r\n\r\n[101] \"Die Bestrafung und polizelliche Behaundlung der gewerbsmässigen\r\nUnzucht.\"\r\n\r\n[102] \"Ueber Gelegenheitsmacherei und öffentliches Tanzvergnügen.\"\r\n\r\n[103] \"Die Prostitution im 19.

The principal reason for such acquiescence\r\nlies in the class interests of the bourgeoisie itself. The bourgeoisie,\r\nor capitalist class, requires the free and unrestricted purveyance of\r\nmale and female labor-power for the fullest development of production.\r\nIn even tempo with the perfection of machinery, and technique; with the\r\nsubdivision of labor into single acts requiring ever less technical\r\nexperience and strength; with the sharpening of the competitive warfare\r\nbetween industry and industry, and between whole regions--country\r\nagainst country, continent against continent--the labor-power of woman\r\ncomes into ever greater demand.\r\n\r\nThe special causes, from which flows this ever increasing enlistment of\r\nwoman in ever increasing numbers, have been detailed above _in extenso_.\r\nWoman is increasingly employed _along with man, or in his place, because\r\nher material demands are less than those of man_. A circumstance\r\npredicated upon her very nature as a sexual being, forces woman to\r\nproffer herself cheaper. More frequently, on an average, than man, woman\r\nis subject to physical derangements, that cause an interruption of work,\r\nand that, in view of the combination and organization of labor, in force\r\nto-day in large production, easily interfere with the steady course of\r\nproduction. Pregnancy and lying-in prolong such pauses. The employer\r\nturns the circumstance to advantage, and _recoups himself doubly for the\r\ninconveniences_, that these disturbances put him to, _with the payment\r\nof much lower wages_.\r\n\r\nMoreover--as may be judged from the quotation on page 90, taken from\r\nMarx's \"Capital\"--the work of married women has a particular fascination\r\nfor the employer. The married woman is, as working-woman, much more\r\n\"attentive and docile\" than her unmarried sister. Thought of her\r\nchildren drives her to the utmost exertion of her powers, in order to\r\nearn the needed livelihood; accordingly, she submits to many an\r\nimposition that the unmarried woman does not. In general, the\r\nworking-woman ventures only exceptionally to join her fellow-toilers in\r\nsecuring better conditions of work. That raises her value in the eyes of\r\nthe employer; not infrequently she is even a trump card in his hands\r\nagainst refractory workingmen. Moreover, she is endowed with great\r\npatience, greater dexterity of fingers, a better developed artistic\r\nsense, the latter of which renders her fitter than man for many branches\r\nof work.\r\n\r\nThese female \"virtues\" are fully appreciated by the virtuous capitalist,\r\nand thus, along with the development of industry, woman finds from year\r\nto year an ever wider field for her application--but, and this is the\r\ndetermining factor, _without tangible improvement to her social\r\ncondition_. If woman labor is employed, it generally sets male labor\r\nfree. The displaced male labor, however, wishes to live; it proffers\r\nitself for lower wages; and the proffer, in turn, re-acts depressingly\r\nupon the wages of the working-woman. The reduction of wages thus turns\r\ninto an endless screw, that, due to the constant revolutions in the\r\ntechnique of the labor-process, is set rotating all the more swiftly,\r\nseeing that the said technical revolutions, through the savings of\r\nlabor-power, set also female labor free,--all of which again increases\r\nthe supply of hands. New industries somewhat counteract the constant\r\nsupply of relatively superfluous labor-power, but are not strong enough\r\nto establish lasting improvement. Every rise of wages above a certain\r\nmeasure causes the employer to look to further improvements in his\r\nplant, calculated to substitute will-less, automatic mechanical devices\r\nfor human hands and human brain. At the start of capitalist production,\r\nhardly any but male labor confronted male labor in the labor-market; now\r\nsex is played against sex, and, further along the line, age against age.\r\nWoman displaces man, and, in her turn, woman is displaced by younger\r\nfolks and child-labor. Such is the \"Moral Order\" in modern industry.\r\n\r\nThe endeavor, on the part of employers, to extend the hours of work,\r\nwith the end in view of pumping more surplus values out of their\r\nemployes, is made easier to them, thanks to the slighter power of\r\nresistance possessed by women. Hence the phenomenon that, in the textile\r\nindustries, for instance, in which women frequently constitute far more\r\nthan one-half of the total labor employed, the hours of work are\r\neverywhere longest. Accustomed from home to the idea that her work is\r\n\"never done,\" woman allows the increased demands to be placed upon her\r\nwithout resistance. In other branches, as in the millinery trade, the\r\nmanufacture of flowers, etc., wages and hours of work deteriorate\r\nthrough the taking home of extra tasks, at which the women sit till\r\nmidnight, and even later, without realizing that they thereby only\r\ncompete against themselves, and, as a result, earn in a sixteen-hour\r\nworkday what they would have made in a regular ten-hour day.[124] In\r\nwhat measure female labor has increased in the leading industrial\r\ncountries may appear from the below sets of tables. We shall start with\r\nthe leading industrial country of Europe,--England. The last census\r\nfurnishes this picture:\r\n\r\n\r\n                Total Persons\r\n    Year.         Employed.

Females.\r\n    1871         11,593,466     8,270,186   3,323,280\r\n    1881         11,187,564     7,783,646   3,403,918\r\n    1891         12,898,484     8,883,254   4,016,230\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, within twenty years, the number of males employed increased\r\n613,068, or 7.9 per cent.; the number of females, however, by 692,950,\r\nor 20.9 per cent. It is especially to be observed in this table that, in\r\n1881, a year of crisis, the number of males employed fell off by\r\n486,540, and the number of females increased by 80,638. The increase of\r\nfemale at the cost of male persons employed is thus emphatically brought\r\nto light. But within the increasing number of female employes itself a\r\nchange is going on: _younger forces are displacing the older_. It\r\ntranspired that in England, during the years 1881-1891, female\r\nlabor-power of the age 10 to 45 had increased, while that above 45 had\r\ndecreased.\r\n\r\nIndustries in which female exceeded considerably the number of male\r\nlabor, were mainly the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n       Industries.                    Females.    Males.\r\n    Manufacture of woman's clothing    415,961      4,470\r\n    Cotton industry                    332,784    213,231\r\n    Manufacture of worsted goods        69,629     40,482\r\n    Manufacture of shirts               52,943      2,153\r\n    Manufacture of hosiery              30,887     18,200\r\n    Lace industry                       21,716     13,030\r\n    Tobacco industry                    15,880     13,090\r\n    Bookbinding                         14,249     11,487\r\n    Manufacture of gloves                9,199      2,756\r\n    Teachers                           144,393     50,628\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain the wages of women are, in almost all branches, considerably lower\r\nthan the wages of men _for the same hours_. In the year 1883, the wages\r\nin England were for men and women as follows, per week:--\r\n\r\n\r\n       Industries.              Males.        Females.\r\n    Flax and jute factories  26    Marks    10-11 Marks\r\n    Manufacture of glass     38      \"      12      \"\r\n    Printing                 32-36   \"      10-12   \"\r\n    Carpet factories         29      \"      15      \"\r\n    Weaving                  26      \"      16      \"\r\n    Shoemaking               29      \"      15      \"\r\n    Dyeing                   25-29   \"      12-13   \"\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilar differences in wages for men and women are found in the Post\r\nOffice service, in school teaching, etc. Only in the cotton industry in\r\nLancashire did both sexes earn equal wages for equal hours of work in\r\nthe tending of power looms.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, according to the census of 1890, there were\r\n2,652,157 women, of the age of ten years and over engaged in productive\r\noccupations:--594,510 in agriculture, 631,988 in manufacture, 59,364 in\r\ntrade and transportation, and 1,366,235 in personal service, of whom\r\n938,910 were servants. Besides that, there were 46,800 female farmers\r\nand planters, 5,135 Government employes, 155,000 school teachers, 13,182\r\nteachers of music, 2,061 artists.[125] In the city of New York, 10,961\r\nworking-women participated in strikes during the year 1890, a sign that\r\nworking-women in the United States, like their European fellow-female\r\nwage slaves, understand the class distinctions that exist between\r\nCapital and Labor. In what measure women are displacing the men in a\r\nnumber of industries in the United States also, is indicated by the\r\nfollowing item from the \"Levest. Journ.\" in 1893:\r\n\r\n\"One of the _features_ of the factory towns of Maine is a class of men\r\nthat may be termed 'housekeepers.' In almost every town, where much\r\nfactory work is done, these men are to be found in large numbers.\r\nWhoever calls shortly before noon will find them, with aprons tied in\r\nfront, washing dishes. At other hours of the day they can be seen\r\nscrubbing, making the beds, washing the children, tidying up the place,\r\nor cooking. Whether any of them attend to the sewing and mending of the\r\nfamily we are not quite sure. These men attend to the household for the\r\nsimple reason that _their wives can earn more in the factory than they_,\r\nand it means a saving of money if the wife goes to work.\"[126]\r\n\r\nThe closing sentence should read: \"Because the women work for wages that\r\nthe men can no longer work for, and the employer therefore prefers\r\nwomen,\"--which happens in Germany also. The towns here described are the\r\nso-called \"she-towns,\" already more fully referred to.\r\n\r\nIn France, there were, in 1893, not less than 15,958 women engaged in\r\nthe railroad service (in the offices and as ticket agents); in the\r\nprovincial Post Office there were 5,383 women employed; as telegraphers\r\nand telephonists, 9,805; and in the State Savings Banks 425. Altogether\r\nthe number of women in France engaged in gainful occupations, inclusive\r\nof agriculture and personal service, was, in 1893, in round figures\r\n4,415,000. Of 3,858 decisions, rendered by the trades courts of Paris,\r\nnot less than 1,674 concerned women.\r\n\r\nTo what extent female labor was applied in the industries of Switzerland\r\nas early as 1886, is told by the following figures of the \"Bund\":\r\n\r\n\r\n        Industries.                  Males.   Females.\r\n    Silk industry                    11,771    51,352\r\n    Cotton industry                  18,320    23,846\r\n    Linen and half-linen industry     5,553     5,232\r\n    Embroidery                       15,724    21,000\r\n\r\n\r\nAltogether, there were then in the textile industries, 103,452 women\r\nengaged, besides 52,838 men; and the \"Bund\" expressly declares that\r\nthere is hardly an occupation in Switzerland in which women are not\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, according to the census of occupations of 1882, of the\r\n7,340,789 persons engaged in gainful occupations, 1,506,743 were women;\r\nor 20.6 per cent. The proportions were, among others, these:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                      Per\r\n       Industries.                Males.  Females.

There were employed in industrial occupations in the German\r\nEmpire:--\r\n\r\n\r\n               Total                  Total Persons Employed.\r\n          Persons Employed.  In the Small Trades.

The strongest increase in\r\nthe number of working-women, as far as we are informed, took place in\r\nthe tobacco industry of Baden. According to the reports of the Baden\r\nFactory Inspector, Dr. Woerishoffer, the number of persons engaged in\r\nthe said industry and their subdivisions by sexes; was as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Total Number\r\n      Year.           Employed.   Males.    Females.\r\n    1882               12,192     5,193      6,999\r\n    1892               24,056     7,932     16,124\r\n                       ------     -----     ------\r\n    Increase           11,864     2,739      9,125\r\n                                or 52.8     or 130\r\n                              per cent.  per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis increase in the number of female tobacco workers, denotes the\r\nsharpening competitive struggle, that has developed during the last ten\r\nyears in the German tobacco as well as many other industries, and which\r\ncompels the ever intenser engagement of the cheaper labor of woman.\r\n\r\nAnd, as in the rest of Germany, so likewise in Baden the industrial\r\ndevelopment in general shows a larger increase of female than of male\r\nworkers. Within a year, it recorded the following changes:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Year.      Males.    Females.\r\n    1892        79,218     35,598\r\n    1893        84,470     38,557\r\n                ------     ------\r\n    Increase     5,252     2,959\r\n                or 6.6    or 8.3\r\n             per cent.  per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the working-women over 16 years of age, 28.27 were married. In the\r\nlarge ammunition factory at Spandau, there were, in 1893, 3,000 women\r\nout of a total of 3,700 employes.\r\n\r\nAs in England, in Germany also, female labor is paid worse than male.\r\nAccording to the report of the Leipsic Chamber of Commerce for the year\r\n1888, the weekly wage for equal hours were:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Males.      Females.\r\n       Industries.             Marks.       Marks.\r\n    Lace manufacture           20   --35   7   --15\r\n    Cloth glove manufacture    12   --30   6   --25\r\n    Linen and jute weaving     12   --27   5   --10\r\n    Wool-carding               15   --27   7.20--10.20\r\n    Sugar refinery             10.50--31   7.50--10\r\n    Leather and leather goods  12   --28   7   --18\r\n    Chemicals                   8.50--25   7.50--10\r\n    Rubber fabrics              9   --28   6   --17\r\n    One factory of paper\r\n      lanterns                 16   --22   7.50--10\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an investigation of the wages earned by the factory hands of Mannheim\r\nin 1893, Dr. Woerishoffer divided the weekly earnings into three\r\nclasses: one, the lowest, in which the wages reached 15 marks; one from\r\n15 to 24; and the last and highest in which wages exceeded 24 marks.\r\nAccording to this subdivision, wages in Mannheim presented the following\r\npicture:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Low.           Medium.        High.\r\n    Both sexes  29.8 per cent.  49.8 per cent.  20.4 per cent.\r\n    Males       20.9 per cent.  56.2 per cent.  22.9 per cent.\r\n    Females     99.2 per cent.   0.7 per cent.   0.1 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe working-women earned mostly veritable starvation wages. They\r\nreceived per week:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Percentage\r\n        Marks.   of Females.\r\n    Under 5         4.62\r\n       5--6         5.47\r\n       6--8        43.96\r\n       8--10       27.45\r\n      10--12       12.38\r\n      12--15        5.38\r\n     Over 15        0.74\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Thüringer Wald district, in 1891, the workingmen engaged in the\r\nslate works received 2.10 marks a day; the women 0.70. In the spinning\r\nestablishments, the men received 2 marks, the women from 0.90 to 1 mark.\r\n\r\nWorst of all are the earnings in the tenement industry, for men as well\r\nas for women, but for the women it is still more miserable than for the\r\nmen. In this branch, hours of work are unlimited; when the season is on,\r\nthey transcend imagination. Furthermore, it is here that the sweating\r\nsystem is generally in vogue, _i. e._, work given out by middlemen\r\n(contractors) who, in recompense for their irksome labor of\r\nsuperintendence, keep to themselves a large part of the wages paid by\r\nthe principal. Under this system, women are also expected to submit to\r\nindignities of other nature.\r\n\r\nHow miserably female labor is paid in the tenement industries, the\r\nfollowing figures on Berlin conditions may indicate. Men's colored\r\nshirts, paid for in 1889 with from 2 marks to 2.50, the employer got in\r\n1893 for 1 mark 50 pfennig. A seamstress of average skill must work from\r\nearly till late if she means to make from 6 to 8 of these shirts. Her\r\nearnings for the week are 4 or 5 marks. An apron-maker earns from 2\r\nmarks 50 pfennig to 5 marks a week; a necktie-maker, 5 to 6 marks; a\r\nskilled blouse-maker, 6 marks; a very skilled female operator on boys'\r\nclothing, 8 to 9 marks; an expert jacket-maker, 5 to 6 marks. A very\r\nswift seamstress on men's shirts may, in the good season, and working\r\nfrom 5 in the morning to 10 at night, make as much as 12 marks.\r\nMillinery workers, who can copy patterns independently, make 30 marks a\r\nmonth. Quick trimmers, with years of experience, earn from 50 to 60\r\nmarks a month during the season. The season usually lasts five months.\r\nAn umbrella-maker, working twelve hours a day, makes 6 to 7 marks. Such\r\nstarvation wages force the working-women into prostitution: even with\r\nthe very plainest wants, no working-women can live in Berlin on less\r\nthan 8 or 9 marks a week.\r\n\r\nAccording to a statistical report on wages, ordered by the Chamber of\r\nCommerce of Reichenberg for its own district, 91 per cent. of all the\r\nworking-women came under the wage category of from 2 to 5 guilders a\r\nweek. Upon the enforcement in Austria of the law on sick insurance, the\r\nauthorities discovered that in 116 districts (21.6 per cent. of all) the\r\nworking-women earned at most 30 kreuzer a day, 90 guilders a year; and\r\nin 428 districts (78.4 per cent. of the total) from 30 to 50 kreuzer, or\r\nfrom 90 to 150 guilders a year. The young working-women, under 16 years\r\nof age, earned in 173 districts (30.9 per cent.) 20 kreuzer a day at the\r\nmost, or at the most 60 guilders a year; and in 387 districts (69.1 per\r\ncent.) from 20 to 30 kreuzer, or from 60 to 90 guilders a year.\r\n\r\nSimilar differences between the wages of male and female labor exist in\r\nall countries on earth. According to the report on Russian industry at\r\nthe Chicago Exposition in 1893, a workingman made in cotton weaving 66\r\nmarks a month, a working-woman 18; a male cotton spinner 66 marks, a\r\nfemale 14. In the lace industry men earned up to 130 marks, women 26; in\r\ncloth manufacture, with the power loom, a working man made 90 marks, a\r\nworking-woman 26 a month.\r\n\r\nThese facts show that woman is increasingly torn from family life by\r\nmodern developments. Marriage and the family, in the bourgeois sense,\r\nare undermined by this development, and dissolved. From the view point\r\nafforded by this fact also, it is an absurdity to direct women to a\r\ndomestic life. That can be done only by such people, who thoughtlessly\r\nwalk the path of life; who fail to see the facts that shape themselves\r\nall around, or do not wish to see them, because they have an interest in\r\nplying the trade of optimism. Facts furnish a very different picture\r\nfrom that presented by such gentlemen.\r\n\r\nIn a large number of industries women are employed exclusively; in a\r\nlarger number they constitute the majority; and in most of the others\r\nwomen are more or less numerously found. Their number steadily\r\nincreases, and they crowd into ever newer occupations, that they had not\r\npreviously engaged in. Finally, the working-woman is not merely paid\r\nworse than the working man; where she does as much as a man, her hours\r\nare, on an average, longer.\r\n\r\nThe German factory ordinances of the year 1891 fixed a maximum of eleven\r\nhours for adult working-women. The same is, however, broken through by a\r\nmass of exceptions that the authorities are allowed to make. Nightwork\r\nalso is forbidden for working-women in factories, but here also the\r\nGovernment can make exceptions in favor of factories where work is\r\ncontinuous, or for special seasons; in sugar refineries, for instance.\r\nGerman legislation has not yet been able to rise to the height of\r\nreally effective measures for the protection of working-women;\r\nconsequently, these are exploited by inhumanly long hours, and\r\nphysically wrecked in the small factories, especially in the tenement\r\nhouse industry. Their exploitation is made all the easier to the\r\nemployer through the circumstance that, until now, a small minority\r\nexcepted, the women have not realized that, the same as the men, they\r\nmust organize in their trades, and, there where also men are employed,\r\nthey must organize jointly with them, in order to conquer for themselves\r\nbetter conditions of work. The ever stronger influx of women in\r\nindustrial pursuits affects, however, not those occupations only that\r\ntheir correspondingly weaker physique especially fits them for, but it\r\naffects also all occupations in which the modern system of exploitation\r\nbelieves it can, with their aid, knock off larger profits. Under this\r\nlatter head belong both the physically exhausting and the most\r\ndisagreeable and dangerous occupations. Thus the fantastic pretence of\r\nseeing in woman only a tender, finely-strung being, such as poets and\r\nwriters of fiction love to depict for the delectation of men, a being,\r\nthat, if it exists at all exists only as an exception, is again reduced\r\nto its true value.\r\n\r\nFacts are obstinate things, and it is only they that concern us. They\r\nalone preserve us from false conclusions, and sentimental twaddle. These\r\nfacts teach us that to-day we find women engaged in the following\r\noccupations, among others:--in cotton, linen and woolen weaving; in\r\ncloth and flannel making; in mechanical spinning, calico printing and\r\ndyeing; in steel pen and pin making; in the preparation of sugar,\r\nchocolate and cocoa; in manufacturing paper and bronzes; in making glass\r\nand porcelain and in glass painting; in the manufacture of faience,\r\nmajolica and earthen ware; in making ink and preparing paints; making\r\ntwine and paper bags; in preparing hops and manure and chemical\r\ndisinfectants; in spinning and weaving silk and ribbons; in making soap,\r\ncandles and rubber goods; in wadding and mat making; in carpet weaving;\r\nportfolio and cardboard making; in making lace and trimmings, and\r\nembroidering; making wall-paper, shoes and leather goods; in refining\r\noil and lard and preparing chemicals of all sorts; in making jewelry and\r\ngalvanoplastic goods; in the preparation of rags and refuse and bast; in\r\nwood carving, xylography and stone coloring; in straw hat making and\r\ncleaning; in making crockery, cigars and tobacco products; in making\r\nlime and gelatine fabrics; in making shoes; in furriery; in hat making;\r\nin making toys; in the flax, shoddy and hair industries; in watchmaking\r\nand housepainting; in the making of spring beds, pencils and wafers; in\r\nmaking looking-glasses, matches and gunpowder preparations; in dipping\r\nphosphorus match-sticks and preparing arsenic; in the tinning of iron;\r\nin the delicacy trade; in book printing and composition; in the\r\npreparation of precious stones; in lithography, photography,\r\nchromo-lithography and metachromotype, and also in the founding of\r\ntypes; in tile making, iron founding and in the preparation of metals\r\ngenerally; in the construction of houses and railroads; in electrical\r\nworks; in book-binding, wood-carving and joining; in the making of\r\nfootwear and clothing; file making; the making of knives and brass\r\ngoods; in manufacturing combs, buttons, gold thread and gas implements;\r\nin the making of tanned goods and trunks; in making starch and chicory\r\npreparations; in metallurgy, wood-planing, umbrella making and fish\r\nmanufacturing; the preservation of fruit, vegetables and meat; in the\r\nmaking of china buttons and fur goods; in mining above ground--in\r\nBelgium also underground after the women are 21 years old; in the\r\nnatural oil and wax production; in slate making and stone breaking; in\r\nmarble and granite polishing; in making cement; the transportation of\r\nbarges and canal boats. Also in the wide field of horticulture,\r\nagriculture and cattle-breeding, and all that is therewith connected.\r\nLastly, in the various industries in which they have long been\r\nconsidered to have the right of way: in the making of linen and woman's\r\nclothing, in the several branches of fashion, also as saleswomen, and\r\nmore recently as clerks, teachers, kindergarten trainers, writers,\r\nartists of all sorts. Thousands upon thousands of women of the middle\r\nclass are being utilized as slaves in the shops and in the markets, and\r\nare thereby withdrawn from all domestic functions, the training of\r\nchildren in particular. Finally, there is one occupation to be\r\nmentioned, in which young, especially pretty, girls are ever more in\r\ndemand, to the great injury of their physical and moral development: it\r\nis the occupation in public resorts of all sorts as bar-maids, singers,\r\ndancers, etc., to attract men in quest of pleasure. This is a field in\r\nwhich impropriety runs riot, and the holders of white slaves lead the\r\nwildest orgies.\r\n\r\nAmong the occupations mentioned, not a few are most dangerous.\r\nDangerous, for instance, are the sulphuric and alkaline gases in the\r\nmanufacturing and cleaning of straw hats; so is the inhalation of\r\nchlorine gases in the bleaching of vegetable materials; the danger of\r\npoisoning is imminent in the manufacture of colored paper, colored\r\nwafers and artificial flowers; in the preparation of metachromotype,\r\npoisons and chemicals; in the painting of leaden soldiers and leaden\r\ntoys. The on-laying of looking-glasses with quicksilver is simply deadly\r\nto the fruit of pregnant women. If, of the live-births in Prussia, 22\r\nper cent. on an average die during the first year, there die, according\r\nto Dr. Hirt, 65 per cent. of the live-births of female on-layers of\r\nquicksilver, 55 per cent. of those of female glass-polishers, 40 per\r\ncent. of those of female lead-makers. In 1890, out of 78 lying-in women,\r\nwho had been occupied in the type foundries of the district of\r\nWiesbaden, only 37 had a normal delivery. Furthermore, according to Dr.\r\nHirt, the manufacture of colored paper and artificial flowers, the\r\nso-called powdering of Brussels lace with white lead, the preparation of\r\ndecalcomania pictures, the on-laying of mirrors, the manufacture of\r\nrubber goods, in short, all occupations at which the working-women are\r\nexposed to the inhalation of carbonic acid gases, are especially\r\ndangerous from the second half of pregnancy onward. Highly dangerous is\r\nalso the manufacture of phosphorus matches and work in the shoddy mills.\r\nAccording to the report of the Baden Trades Inspector for 1893, the\r\nyearly average of premature births with women engaged in industry rose\r\nfrom 1,039 in the years 1882-1886, to 1,244 in the years 1887-1891. The\r\nnumber of births that had to be aided by an operation averaged for the\r\nperiod of 1882-1886 the figures of 1,118 a year, and for the period of\r\n1886-1891 it averaged 1,385. Facts much graver than any of these would\r\ncome to light if similar investigations were held also in the more\r\nindustrially developed countries and provinces of Germany. As a rule the\r\nInspectors are satisfied with stating in their reports: \"No specially\r\ninjurious effects were discovered in the employment of women in the\r\nfactories.\" How could they discover any, with their short visits and\r\nwithout drawing upon medical advice? That, moreover, there are great\r\ndangers to life and limb, especially in the textile industry, in the\r\nmanufacture of explosives and in work with agricultural machinery, is an\r\nestablished fact. Even a glance at the above and quite incomplete list\r\nwill tell every reader that a large number of these occupations are\r\namong the hardest and most exhausting even to men. Let people say as\r\nthey please, this work or that is not suitable for woman; what boots the\r\nobjection if no other and more suitable occupation is furnished her?\r\n\r\nAmong the branches of industry, or special occupations in the same, that\r\nDr. Hirt[127] considers girls should not be at all employed in, by\r\nreason of the danger to health, especially with an eye to their sexual\r\nfunctions, are: The preparation of bronze colors, of velvet and glazed\r\npaper, hat making, glass grinding, lithography, flax combing, horsehair\r\ntwisting, fustian pulling, iron tinning, and work in the flax and shoddy\r\nmill.\r\n\r\nIn the following trades, young girls should be occupied only when the\r\nnecessary protective measures (ventilation, etc.) are properly provided\r\nfor: The manufacture of paper matting, china ware, lead pencils, shot\r\nlead, etherial oils, alum, blood-lye, bromium, chinin, soda, paraffin\r\nand ultramarine (poisonous) colored paper, wafers that contain poison,\r\nmetachromotypes, phosphorous matches, Schweinfurt green and artificial\r\nflowers. Also in the cutting and sorting of rags, sorting and coloring\r\nof tobacco leaf, cotton beating, wool and silk carding, cleaning of bed\r\nfeathers, sorting pencil hairs, washing (sulphur) straw hats,\r\nvulcanizing and melting rubber, coloring and printing calico, painting\r\nlead soldiers, packing snuff, wire netting, on-laying of mirrors,\r\ngrinding needles and steel pens.\r\n\r\nTruly, it is no inspiring sight to see women, and even pregnant ones, at\r\nthe construction of railroads, pushing heavily laden wheelbarrows in\r\ncompetition with men; or to watch them as helpers, mixing mortar and\r\ncement or carrying heavy loads of stone at the construction of houses;\r\nor in the coal pits and iron works. All that is womanly is thereby\r\nrubbed off from woman, her womanliness is trodden under foot, the same\r\nas, conversely, all manly attributes are stripped from the men in\r\nhundreds of other occupations. Such are the sequels of social\r\nexploitation and of social war. Our corrupt social conditions turn\r\nthings topsy-turvy.\r\n\r\nIt is, accordingly, easy to understand that, considering the extent to\r\nwhich female labor now prevails, and threatens to make still further\r\ninroads in all fields of productive activity, the men, highly interested\r\nin the development, look on with eyes far from friendly, and that here\r\nand there the demand is heard for the suppression of female labor and\r\nits prohibition by law. Unquestionably, with the extension of female\r\nlabor, the family life of the working class goes ever more to pieces,\r\nthe dissolution of marriage and the family is a natural result, and\r\nimmorality, demoralization, degeneration, diseases of all natures and\r\nchild mortality increase at a shocking pace. According to the statistics\r\nof population of the Kingdom of Saxony, child mortality has greatly\r\nincreased in all those cities that became genuine manufacturing places\r\nduring the last 25 or 30 years. During the period 1880-1885 there died\r\nin the cities of Saxony, on an average, 28.5 per cent. of the\r\nlive-births during the first year of life. In the period of 1886-1890,\r\n45.0 of the live-births died in Ernsthal during the first year of their\r\nlives, 44.5 in Stolling, 40.4 in Zschopau, 38.9 in Lichtenstein, 38.3 in\r\nThum, 38.2 in Meerane, 37.7 in Crimmitschau, 37.2 in Burgstaedt, 37.1 in\r\nWerdau, 36.5 in Ehrenfriedersdorf, 35.8 in Chemnitz, 35.5 in\r\nFrankenberg, 35.2 in Buchholz, 35.1 in Schneeberg, 34.7 in Lunzenau,\r\n34.6 in Hartha, 34.5 in Geithaim, etc.[128] Worse yet stood things in\r\nthe majority of the large factory villages, quite a number of whom\r\nregistered a mortality of 40 to 50 per cent. Yet, all this\r\nnotwithstanding, the social development, productive of such sad results,\r\nis progress,--precisely such progress as the freedom to choose a trade,\r\nfreedom of emigration, freedom to marry, and the removal of all other\r\nbarriers, thus promoting the development of capitalism on a large scale,\r\nbut thereby also giving the death-blow to the middle class and preparing\r\nits downfall.\r\n\r\nThe working class is not inclined to help the small producer, should he\r\nattempt the re-establishment of restrictions to the freedom to choose a\r\ntrade and of emigration, or the restoration of the guild and corporation\r\nrestrictions, contemplated with the end in view of artificially keeping\r\ndwarf-production alive for a little while longer,--more than that is\r\nbeyond their power. As little is a return possible to the former state\r\nof things with regard to female labor, but that does not exclude\r\nstringent laws for the prevention of the excessive exploitation of\r\nfemale and child labor, and of children of school age. In this the\r\ninterests of the working class coincides with the interests of the\r\nState, of humanity, in general, and of civilization. When we see the\r\nState compelled to lower the minimum requirements for military\r\nservice--as happened several times during the last decades, the last\r\ntime in 1893, when the army was to be further increased--and we see such\r\nlowering of the minimum requirements resorted to for the reason that, as\r\na result of degenerating effects of our economic system, the number of\r\nyoung men unfit for military service becomes ever larger,--when we see\r\nthat, then, forsooth, all are interested in protective measures. The\r\nultimate aim must be to remove the ills, that progress--such as\r\nmachinery, improved means of production and the whole modern system of\r\nlabor--has called forth, while at the same time causing the enormous\r\nadvantages, that such progress is instinct with for man, and the still\r\ngreater advantages it is capable of, to accrue in full measure to all\r\nthe members of society, by means of a corresponding organization of\r\nhuman labor.[129]\r\n\r\nIt is an absurdity and a crying wrong that the improvements and\r\nconquests of civilization--the collective product of all--accrue to the\r\nbenefit of those alone who, in virtue of their material power, are able\r\nto appropriate them to themselves, while, on the other hand, thousands\r\nof diligent workingmen are assailed with fear and worry when they learn\r\nthat human genius has made yet another invention able to multiply many\r\nfold the product of manual labor, and thereby opening to them the\r\nprospect of being thrown as useless and superfluous upon the sidewalks.\r\nThus, that which should be greeted with universal joy becomes an object\r\nof hostility, that in former years occasioned the storming of many a\r\nfactory and the demolition of many a new machine. A similar hostile\r\nfeeling exists to-day between man and woman as workers. This feeling\r\nalso is unnatural. The point, consequently, is to seek to establish a\r\nsocial condition in which the _full equality of all without distinction\r\nof sex shall be the norm of conduct_.\r\n\r\n_The feat is feasible--the moment all the means of production become\r\nthe property of society; when collective labor, by the application of\r\nall technical and scientific advantages and aids in the process of\r\nproduction, reaches the highest degree of fertility; and when the\r\nobligation lies upon all, capable of work, to furnish a certain measure\r\nof labor to society, necessary for the satisfaction of social wants, in\r\nexchange whereof society guarantees to each and all the means requisite\r\nfor the development of his faculties and for the enjoyment of life._\r\n\r\nWoman shall be like man, a productive and useful member of society,\r\nequal-righted with him. Precisely like man, she shall be placed in\r\nposition to fully develop all her physical and mental faculties, to\r\nfulfil her duties, and to exercise her rights. A free being and the peer\r\nof man, she is safe against degradation.\r\n\r\nWe shall point out how modern developments in society run out into such\r\na state of things, and that it is these very crass and monstrous ills in\r\nmodern development that compel the establishment of the New Order.\r\n\r\nAlthough the development of the position of woman, as above\r\ncharacterized, is palpable, is tangible to the sight of all who have\r\neyes to see, the twaddle about the \"natural calling\" of woman is heard\r\ndaily, assigning her to domestic duties and the family. The phrase is\r\nheard loudest there where woman endeavors to penetrate into the sphere\r\nof the so-called higher professions, as for instance, the higher\r\ndepartments of instruction and of the civil service, the medical or\r\nlegal careers, and the pursuit of the natural sciences. The most\r\nlaughable and absurd objections are fetched up, and are defended with\r\nthe air of \"learning.\" Gentlemen, who pass for learned, appeal, in this\r\nas in so many other things, to science in order to defend the most\r\nabsurd and untenable propositions. Their chief trump card is that woman\r\nis inferior to man in mental powers and that it is folly to believe she\r\ncould achieve aught of importance in the intellectual field.\r\n\r\nThese objections, raised by the \"learned,\" fit so well with the general\r\nprejudices entertained by men on the calling and faculties of woman\r\nthat, whoever makes use of them can count upon the applause of the\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nNew ideas will ever meet with stubborn opposition so long as general\r\nculture and knowledge continue at so low an ebb as at present,\r\nespecially if it lies in the interest of the ruling classes to confine\r\nculture and knowledge as much as possible to their own ranks. Hence new\r\nideas will at the start win over but a small minority, and this will be\r\nscoffed at, maligned and persecuted. But if these new ideas are good and\r\nsound, if they are born as the necessary consequence of existing\r\nconditions, then will they spread, and the one-time minority finally\r\nbecomes a majority. So has it been with all new ideas in the course of\r\nhistory: the idea of establishing the complete emancipation of woman\r\npresents the same experience.\r\n\r\nWere not one time the believers in Christianity a small minority? Did\r\nnot the Protestant Reformers and modern bourgeoisdom once face\r\noverpowering adversaries? And yet they triumphed. Was the Social\r\nDemocracy crippled because gagged and pinioned by exclusion laws, so\r\nthat it could not budge? Never was its triumph more assured than when it\r\nwas thought to have been killed. The Social Democracy overcame the\r\nexclusion laws; it will overcome quite other obstacles besides.\r\n\r\nThe claim regarding the \"natural calling of woman,\" according whereto\r\nshe should be housekeeper and nurse, is as unfounded as the claim that\r\nthere will ever be kings because, since the start of history, there have\r\nbeen such somewhere. We know not where the first king sprang up, as\r\nlittle as we know where the first capitalist stepped upon the scene.\r\nThis, however, we do know: Kingship has undergone material changes in\r\nthe course of the centuries, and the tendency of development is to strip\r\nit ever more of its powers, until a time comes, no longer far away, when\r\nit will be found wholly superfluous. As with the kingship, so with all\r\nother social and political institutions; they are all subject to\r\ncontinuous changes and transformations, and to final and complete decay.\r\nWe have seen, in the course of the preceding historic sketch, that the\r\nform of marriage, in force to-day, like the position of woman, was by no\r\nmeans such \"eternally\"; that, on the contrary, both were the product of\r\na long process of development, which has by no means reached its acme,\r\nand can reach it only in the future. If 2,400 or 2,300 years ago\r\nDemosthenes could designate the \"bringing forth of legitimate children\r\nand officiating as a faithful warder of the house\" as the only\r\noccupation of woman, to-day we have traveled past that point. Who,\r\nto-day, would dare uphold such a position of woman as \"natural\" without\r\nexposing himself to the charge of belittling her? True enough, there are\r\neven to-day such sots, who share in silence the views of the old\r\nAthenian; but none dare proclaim publicly that which 2,300 years ago one\r\nof the most eminent orators dared proclaim frankly and openly as\r\n_natural_. Therein lies the great advance made.\r\n\r\nIf, on the one hand, modern development, especially in industrial life,\r\nhas wrecked millions of marriages, it, on the other hand, promoted\r\nfavorably the development itself of marriage. Only a few decades ago,\r\nand it was a matter of course in every citizen's or peasant's house not\r\nonly that woman sewed, knitted and washed--although even this has now\r\nextensively gone out of fashion--but she also baked the bread, spun,\r\nwove, bleached, brewed beer, boiled soap, made candles. To have a piece\r\nof wearing apparel made out of the house was looked upon as unutterable\r\nwaste. Water-pipes, gaslight, gas and oil cooking ranges--to say nothing\r\nof the respective electric improvements--together with numberless\r\nothers, were wholly unknown to the women of former times. Antiquated\r\nconditions exist even to-day, but they are the exception. The majority\r\nof women have discontinued many an occupation, formerly considered of\r\ncourse, the same being attended to in factory and shop better, more\r\nexpeditiously and cheaper than the housewife could, whence, at least in\r\nthe cities, all domestic requirements for them are wanting. Thus, in the\r\nperiod of a few decades, a great revolution for them has been\r\naccomplished within our family life, and we pay so little attention to\r\nthe fact because we consider it a matter of course. Phenomena, that\r\ndevelop, so to speak, under the very eyes of man, are not noticed by\r\nhim, unless they appear suddenly and disturb the even tenor of events.\r\nHe bristles up, however, against new ideas that threaten to lead him out\r\nof the accustomed ruts.\r\n\r\nThe revolution thus accomplished in our domestic life, and that\r\nprogresses ever further, has altered the position of woman in the\r\nfamily, in other directions besides. Woman has become freer, more\r\nindependent. Our grandmothers, if they were honest masters' wives, would\r\nnot have dared, and, indeed the thought never crossed their minds, to\r\nkeep their working people and apprentices from the table, and visiting,\r\ninstead, the theatres, concerts and pleasure resorts, by day at that.\r\nWhich of those good old women dared think of occupying her mind with\r\npublic affairs, as is now done by many women? To-day they start\r\nsocieties for all manner of objects, establish papers, call conventions.\r\nAs working-women they assemble in trades unions, they attend the\r\nmeetings and join the organizations of men, and here and there--we are\r\nspeaking of Germany--they have had the right of electing boards of labor\r\narbitration, a right that the backward majority of the Reichstag took\r\naway again from them in the year of grace one thousand eight hundred and\r\nninety.\r\n\r\nWhat sot would seek to annul the changes just described, although the\r\nfact is not to be gainsaid that, there are also dark sides to the bright\r\nsides of the picture, consequent upon our seething and decaying\r\nconditions? The bright sides, however, predominate. Women themselves,\r\nhowever conservative they are as a body, have no inclination to return\r\nto the old, narrow, patriarchal conditions of former times.\r\n\r\nIn the United States society still stands, true enough, on bourgeois\r\nfoundations; but it is forced to wrestle neither with old European\r\nprejudices nor with institutions that have survived their day. As a\r\nconsequence American society is far readier to adopt new ideas and\r\ninstitutions that promise advantage. For some time the position of\r\nwoman has been looked upon from a viewpoint different than ours. There,\r\nfor instance, the idea has long taken hold that it is not merely\r\ntroublesome and improper, but not even profitable to the purse, for the\r\nwife to bake bread and brew beer, but that it is unnecessary for her to\r\ncook in her own kitchen. The private kitchen is supplanted by\r\nco-operative cooking, with a large central kitchen and machinery. The\r\nwomen attend to the work by turns, and the meals generally come out\r\ncheaper, taste better, offer a greater variety, and give much less\r\ntrouble. Our army officers, who are not decried as Socialists and\r\nCommunists, act on a similar plan. They establish in their casinos a\r\nco-operative kitchen; appoint a steward, who attends to the supply of\r\nvictuals on a large scale; the bill of fare is arranged in common; and\r\nthe food is prepared in the steam kitchen of the barracks. They live\r\nmuch cheaper than in a hotel, and fare at least as well. Furthermore,\r\nthousands of the rich families live the whole year, or part of the year,\r\nin boarding-houses or hotels, without in any way missing the private\r\nkitchen. On the contrary, they consider it a great convenience to be rid\r\nof it. The aversion of especially well-to-do women towards all matters\r\nconnected with the kitchen does not seem to indicate that this function\r\neither belongs to the category of the \"natural calling\" of woman. On the\r\ncontrary, the circumstance that princely and other prominent families do\r\nlike the hotels, and all of them engage male cooks for the preparation\r\nof their food, would rather indicate that cooking is a male\r\noccupation.--All of which is stated for the benefit of those people who\r\nare unable to picture to themselves a woman not brandishing a kitchen\r\nladle.\r\n\r\nIt is but a step to set up, beside the central kitchen, also the central\r\nlaundry and corresponding steaming arrangements for public use--as\r\nalready established in all large cities by rich private persons or\r\nspeculators, and found highly profitable. With the central kitchen may\r\nalso be connected central heating, warm water along with cold water\r\npipes, whereby a number of bothersome and time-consuming labors are done\r\naway with. Large hotels, many private houses, hospitals, schools,\r\nbarracks, etc., have now these and many other such arrangements, such as\r\nelectric light and baths. The only fault to find is that only public\r\nestablishments and the well-to-do classes enjoy these advantages. Placed\r\nwithin the reach of all, an enormous amount of time, trouble, labor and\r\nmaterial could be saved, and the standard of life and the well-being of\r\nall raised considerably. In the summer of 1890, the papers published a\r\ndescription of the progress made in the United States in the matter of\r\ncentralized heating and ventilation. It was there stated:\r\n\r\n\"The recent attempts, made especially in North America, to effect the\r\nheating of whole blocks of houses or city wards from one place have to\r\nrecord no slight success. From the constructive point of view, they have\r\nbeen carried out so carefully and effectively that, in view of the\r\nfavorable results and the financial advantages which they offer, their\r\nfurther extension may be confidently expected. More recently the attempt\r\nis being made to furnish from central locations not heat alone, but also\r\nfresh air, either warm or cool, to certain extensive but not too wide\r\nareas of the city. These plans are found in execution in the so-called\r\nTimby System, which, according to the central organ of the Department of\r\nBuildings, gathered from a report of the technical attaché in\r\nWashington, Government Architect Petri, has recently been thoroughly\r\nexplained in Washington by the 'National Heating and Ventilating\r\nCompany.' The said company originally planned to supply 50,000 people\r\nfrom one place. The difficulties presented by the requisite speed of\r\ntransit and the size of the pneumatic machines, have, however, caused a\r\nlimitation to 0.8 kilometers, and in instances of specially closely\r\nbuilt business quarters, the building of a special central power place.\"\r\n\r\nWhat was then only projected, has since been in great part executed.\r\nPhilistine narrowness in Germany lives to shrug its shoulders at these\r\nand such like schemes, although in Germany also we find ourselves just\r\nnow in the midst of one of those technical revolutions, that render the\r\nprivate kitchen, together with a number of other occupations, hitherto\r\nappertaining to the household, as superfluous as handicraft has been\r\nrendered by machinery and modern technique. In the early days of the\r\nnineteenth century, Napoleon pronounced insane the idea of constructing\r\na ship that could be set in motion by steam. The idea of building a\r\nrailroad was declared silly by many folks who passed for sensible:\r\nnobody, it was argued, could remain alive on such a conveyance: the\r\nrapidity of motion would deprive the passengers of breath. Identical\r\ntreatment is to-day accorded to a number of new ideas. He who sixty\r\nyears ago would have made to our women the proposition of replacing the\r\ncarrying of water with water-pipes, would have been exposed to the\r\ncharge of trying to lead women and servants into idleness.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the great revolution in technique is in full march on all\r\nfields; nothing can any longer hold it back; and bourgeois society,\r\nhaving conjured the same into life, has the historic mission of also\r\ncarrying the revolution to perfection, and to promote on all fields the\r\nbudding of the germs for radical transformations, _which a social order,\r\nbuilt on new foundations, would only have to generalize on a large\r\nscale, and make common property_.\r\n\r\nThe trend, accordingly, of our social life is not to banish woman back\r\nto the house and the hearth, as our \"domestic life\" fanatics prescribe,\r\nand after which they lust, like the Jews in the Desert after the\r\nfleshpots of Egypt. _On the contrary, the whole trend of society is to\r\nlead woman out of the narrow sphere of strictly domestic life to a full\r\nparticipation in the public life of the people_--a designation that will\r\nnot then cover the male sex only--and in the task of _human\r\ncivilization_. Laveleye fully recognized this when he wrote:[130] \"In\r\nthe measure that what we are in the habit of designating as civilization\r\nadvances, the sentiments of piety and the family bonds weaken, and they\r\nexercise a decreasing influence upon the actions of men. This fact is so\r\ngeneral that a law of social development may be recognized therein.\" Not\r\nonly has the position of woman changed, but also the relation of son and\r\ndaughter to the family, who have gradually attained a degree of\r\nindependence unknown in former days,--a fact noticeable especially in\r\nthe United States, where the self-dependent and independent education of\r\nthe individual is carried on much further than with us. The dark sides\r\nthat to-day accompany also this form of development, are not necessarily\r\nconnected with it; they lie in the social conditions of our times.\r\nCapitalist society evokes no beneficent phenomenon unaccompanied with a\r\ndark side: as Fourier long ago pointed out with great perspicacity,\r\ncapitalist society is in all its progressive steps double-faced and\r\nambiguous.\r\n\r\nWith Laveleye, Schaeffle also detects in the changed character of the\r\nfamily of our days the effect of social development. He says:[131] \"It\r\nis true that the tendency described in Chapter II, to reduce and limit\r\nthe family to its specific functions is traceable throughout history.\r\nThe family relinquishes one provisional and temporary function after the\r\nother. In so far as it officiated only in a surrogate and gap-filling\r\ncapacity it makes way to independent institutions for law, order,\r\nauthority, divine service, education, technique, etc., as soon as these\r\ninstitutions take shape.\"\r\n\r\nWomen are pressing even further, though as yet only in a minority, and\r\nonly a fraction of these with clear aims. They aspire to measure their\r\npower with men, not on the industrial field alone; they aspire not only\r\nafter a freer and more independent position in the family; they also\r\naspire at turning their mental faculties to the higher walks of life.\r\nThe favorite objection raised against them is that they are not fit for\r\nsuch pursuits, not being intended therefor by Nature. The question of\r\nengaging in the higher professional occupations concerns at present only\r\na small number of women in modern society; it is, however, important in\r\npoint of principle. The large majority of men believe in all seriousness\r\nthat, mentally as well, woman must ever remain subordinate to them, and,\r\nhence, has no right to equality. They are, accordingly, the most\r\ndetermined opponents of woman's aspirations.\r\n\r\nThe self-same men, who raise no objection whatever to the employment of\r\nwoman in occupations, many of which are very exhausting, often\r\ndangerous, threaten the impairment of her feminine physique and\r\nviolently compel her to sin against her duties as a mother,--these\r\nself-same men would exclude her from pursuits in which these obstacles\r\nand dangers are much slighter, and which are much better suited to her\r\ndelicate frame.\r\n\r\nAmong the learned men, who in Germany want to hear nothing of the\r\nadmission of women to the higher studies, or who will yield only a\r\nqualified assent, and express themselves publicly on the subject are\r\nProf. L. Bischoff, Dr. Ludwig Hirt, Prof. H. Sybel, L. von Buerenbach,\r\nDr. E. Reich, and many others. Notedly has the livelier agitation,\r\nrecently set on foot, for the admission of women to the Universities,\r\nincited a strong opposition against the plan in Germany. The opposition\r\nis mainly directed against woman's qualifications for the study of\r\nmedicine. Among the opponents are found Pochhammer, Fehling, S. Binder,\r\nWaldeyer, Hegar, etc. Von Buerenbach is of the opinion that both the\r\nadmission to and the fitness of woman for science can be disposed of\r\nwith the argument that, until now, no genius has arisen among woman, and\r\nhence woman is manifestly unfit for philosophic studies. It seems the\r\nworld has had quite enough of its male philosophers: it can, without\r\ninjury to itself, well afford to dispense with female. Neither does the\r\nobjection that the female sex has never yet produced a genius seem to us\r\neither to hold water, or to have the weight of a demonstration. Geniuses\r\ndo not drop down from the skies; they must have opportunity to form and\r\nmature. This opportunity woman has lacked until now, as amply shown by\r\nour short historic sketch. For thousands of years she has been\r\noppressed, and she has been deprived or stunted in the opportunity and\r\npossibility to unfold her mental faculties. It is as false to reason\r\nthat the female sex is bereft of genius, by denying all spark of genius\r\nto the tolerably large number of great women, as it would be to maintain\r\nthat there were no geniuses among the male sex other than the few who\r\nare considered such. Every village schoolmaster knows what a mass of\r\naptitudes among his pupils never reach full growth, because the\r\npossibilities for their development are absent. Aye, there is not one,\r\nwho, in his walk through life, has not become acquainted, some with\r\nmore, others with fewer persons of whom it had to be said that, had they\r\nbeen able to mature under more favorable circumstances, they would have\r\nbeen ornaments to society, and men of genius. Unquestionably the number\r\nof men of talent and of genius is by far larger among the male sex than\r\nthose that, until now, have been able to reveal themselves: social\r\nconditions did not allow the others to develop. Precisely so with the\r\nfaculties of the female sex, a sex that for centuries has been held\r\nunder, hampered and crippled, far worse than any other subject beings.\r\nWe have absolutely no measure to-day by which to gauge the fullness of\r\nmental powers and faculties that will develop among men and women so\r\nsoon as they shall be able to unfold amid natural conditions.\r\n\r\nIt is with mankind as in the vegetable kingdom. Millions of valuable\r\nseeds never reach development because the ground on which they fall is\r\nunfavorable, or is taken up by weeds that rob the young and better plant\r\nof air, light and nourishment. The same laws of Nature hold good in\r\nhuman life. If a gardener or planter sought to maintain with regard to a\r\ngiven plant that it could not grow, although he made no trial, perhaps\r\neven hindered its growth by wrong treatment, such a man would be\r\npronounced a fool by all his intelligent neighbors. Nor would he fare\r\nany better if he declined to cross one of his female domestic animals\r\nwith, a male of higher breed, to the end of producing a better animal.\r\n\r\nThere is no peasant in Germany to-day so ignorant as not to understand\r\nthe advantage of such treatment of his trees or animals--provided always\r\nhis means allow him to introduce the better method. Only with regard to\r\nhuman beings do even men of learning deny the force of that which with\r\nregard to all other matters, they consider an established law. And yet\r\nevery one, even without being a naturalist, can make instructive\r\nobservations in life. Whence comes it that the children of peasants\r\ndiffer from city children? It comes from the difference in their\r\nconditions of life and education.\r\n\r\nThe one-sidedness, inherent in the education for one calling, stamps man\r\nwith a peculiar character. A clergyman or a schoolmaster is generally\r\nand easily recognized by his carriage and mien; likewise an officer,\r\neven when in civilian dress. A shoe maker is easily told from a tailor,\r\na joiner from a locksmith. Twin brothers, who closely resembled each\r\nother in youth, show in later years marked differences if their\r\noccupations are different, if one had hard manual work, for instance, as\r\na smith, the other the study of philosophy for his duty. Heredity, on\r\none side, adaptation on the other, play in the development of man, as\r\nwell as of animals, a decisive _role_. Indeed, man is the most bending\r\nand pliable of all creatures. A few years of changed life and occupation\r\noften suffice to make quite a different being out of the same man.\r\nNowhere does rapid external change show itself more strikingly than when\r\na person is transferred from poor and reduced, to materially improved\r\ncircumstances. It is in his mental make-up that such a person will be\r\nleast able to deny his antecedents, but that is due to the circumstance\r\nthat, with most of such people, after they have reached a certain age,\r\nthe desire for intellectual improvement is rarely felt; neither do they\r\nneed it. Such an upstart rarely suffers under this defect. In our days,\r\nthat look to money and material means, people are far readier to bow\r\n_before the man with a large purse, than before a man of knowledge and\r\ngreat intellectual gifts, especially if he has the misfortune of being\r\npoor and rankless_. Instances of this sort are furnished every day. The\r\nworship of the golden calf stood in no age higher than in this,--whence\r\nit comes that we are living \"in the best possible world.\"\r\n\r\nThe strongest evidence of the effect exercised upon man by radically\r\ndifferent conditions of life is furnished in our several industrial\r\ncenters. In these centers employer and employe present externally such a\r\ncontrast as if they belonged to different races. Although accustomed to\r\nthe contrast, it struck us almost with the shock of a surprise on the\r\noccasion of a campaign mass meeting, that we addressed in the winter of\r\n1877 in an industrial town of the Erzgebirge region. The meeting, at\r\nwhich a debate was to be held between a liberal professor and ourselves,\r\nwas so arranged that both sides were equally represented. The front part\r\nof the hall was taken by our opponents,--almost without exception,\r\nhealthy, strong, often large figures; in the rear of the hall and in the\r\ngalleries stood workingmen and small tradesmen, nine-tenths of the\r\nformer weavers,--mostly short, thin, shallow-chested, pale-faced\r\nfigures, with whom worry and want looked out at every pore. One set\r\nrepresented the full-stomached virtue and solvent morality of bourgeois\r\nsociety; the other set, the working bees and beasts of burden, on the\r\nproduct of whose labor the gentlemen made so fine an appearance. _Let\r\nboth be placed for one generation under equally favorable conditions,\r\nand the contrast will vanish with most; it certainly is blotted out in\r\ntheir descendants._\r\n\r\nIt is also evident that, in general, it is harder to determine the\r\nsocial standing of women than of men. Women adapt themselves more\r\nreadily to new conditions; they acquire higher manners more quickly.\r\nTheir power of accommodation is greater than that of more clumsy man.\r\n\r\nWhat to a plant are good soil, light and air, are to man healthy social\r\nconditions, that allow him to unfold his powers. The well known saying:\r\n\"Man is what he eats,\" expresses the same thought, although somewhat\r\none-sidedly: The question is not merely what man eats; it embraces his\r\nwhole social posture, the social atmosphere in which he moves, that\r\npromotes or stunts his physical and mental development, that affects,\r\nfavorably or unfavorably, his sense of feeling, of thought, and of\r\naction. Every day we see people, situated in favorable material\r\nconditions, going physically and morally to wreck, simply because,\r\nbeyond the narrower sphere of their own domestic or personal\r\nsurroundings, unfavorable circumstances of a social nature operate upon\r\nthem, and gain such overpowering ascendency that they switch them on\r\nwrong tracks. The general conditions under which a man lives are even\r\nof far greater importance than those of the home and the family. If the\r\nconditions for social development are equal to both sexes, if to neither\r\nthere stand any obstacles in the way, and if the social state of society\r\nis a healthy one, _then woman also will rise to a point of perfection in\r\nher being, such as we can have no full conception of, such conditions\r\nhaving hitherto been absent in the history of the development of the\r\nrace_. That which some women are in the meantime achieving, leaves no\r\ndoubt upon this head: these rise as high above the mass of their own sex\r\nas the male geniuses do above the mass of theirs. Measured with the\r\nscale usually applied to Princes, women have, on an average, displayed\r\ngreater talent than men in the ruling of States. As illustrations, let\r\nIsabella and Blanche of Castile be quoted; Elizabeth of Hungary;\r\nCatharine Sforza, the Duchess of Milan and Imola; Elizabeth of England;\r\nCatharine of Russia; Maria Theresa, etc. Resting upon the fact that, in\r\nall races and all parts of the world, women have ruled with marked\r\nability, even over the wildest and most turbulent hordes, Burbach makes\r\nthe statement that, _in all probability, women are fitter for politics\r\nthan men_.[132] For the rest, many a great man in history would shrink\r\nconsiderably, were it only known What he owes to himself, and what to\r\nothers. Count Mirabeau, for instance, is described by German historians,\r\nvon Sybel among them, as one of the greatest lights of the French\r\nRevolution: and now research has revealed the fact that this light was\r\nindebted for the concept of almost all of his speeches to the ready help\r\nof certain scholars, who worked for him in secret, and whom he\r\nunderstood to utilize. On the other hand, apparitions like those of a\r\nSappho, a Diotima of the days of Socrates, a Hypatia of Alexander, a\r\nMadame Roland, Madame de Stael, George Sand, etc., deserve the greatest\r\nrespect, and eclipse many a male star. The effect of women as mothers of\r\ngreat men is also known. Woman has achieved all that was possible to her\r\nunder the, to her, as a whole, most unfavorable circumstances; all of\r\nwhich justifies the best hopes for the future. As a matter of fact, only\r\nthe second half of the nineteenth century began to smooth the way for\r\nthe admission of women in large numbers to the race with men on various\r\nfields; and quite satisfactory are the results attained.\r\n\r\nBut suppose that, on an average, women are not as capable of higher\r\ndevelopment as men, that they cannot grow into geniuses and great\r\nphilosophers, was this a criterion for men when, at least according to\r\nthe letter of the law, they were placed on a footing of equality with\r\n\"geniuses\" and \"philosophers?\" The identical men of learning, who deny\r\nhigher aptitudes to woman, are quite inclined to do the same to artisans\r\nand workingmen. When the nobility appeals to its \"blue\" blood and to\r\nits genealogical tree, these men of learning laugh in derision and shrug\r\ntheir shoulders; but as against the man of lower rank, they consider\r\nthemselves an aristocracy, that owes what it is, not to more favorable\r\nconditions of life, but to its own talent alone. The same men who, on\r\none field, are among the freest from prejudice, and who hold him lightly\r\nwho does not think as liberally as themselves, are, on another\r\nfield,--the moment the interests of their rank and class, or their\r\nvanity and self-esteem are concerned--found narrow to the point of\r\nstupidity, and hostile to the point of fanaticism. The men of the upper\r\nclasses look down upon the lower; and so does almost the whole sex upon\r\nwoman. The majority of men see in woman only an article of profit and\r\npleasure; to acknowledge her an equal runs against the grain of their\r\nprejudices:--woman must be humble and modest; she must confine herself\r\nexclusively to the house and leave all else to the men, the \"lords of\r\ncreation,\" as their domain: woman must, to the utmost, bridle her own\r\nthoughts and inclinations, and quietly accept what her Providence on\r\nearth--father or husband--decrees. The nearer she approaches this\r\nstandard, all the more is she praised as \"sensible, modest and\r\nvirtuous,\" even though, as the result of such constraint, she break down\r\nunder the burden of physical and moral suffering. What absurdity is it\r\nnot to speak of the \"equality of all\" and yet seek to keep one-half of\r\nthe human race outside of the pale!\r\n\r\nWoman has the same right as man to unfold her faculties and to the free\r\nexercise of the same: she is human as well as he: like him, she should\r\nbe free to dispose of herself as her own master. The accident of being\r\nborn a woman, makes no difference. To exclude woman from equality on the\r\nground that she was born female and not male--an accident for which man\r\nis as little responsible as she--is as inequitable, as would be to make\r\nrights and privileges dependent upon the accident of religion or\r\npolitical bias; and as senseless as that two human beings must look upon\r\neach other as enemies on the ground that the accident of birth makes\r\nthem of different stock and nationality. Such views are unworthy of a\r\ntruly free being. The progress of humanity lies in removing everything\r\nthat holds one being, one class, one sex, in dependence and in\r\nsubjection to another. _No inequality is justified other than that which\r\nNature itself establishes in the differences between one individual and\r\nanother, and for the fulfillment of the purpose of Nature. The natural\r\nboundaries no sex can overstep: it would thereby destroy its own natural\r\npurpose._\r\n\r\nThe adversaries of full equality for woman play as their trump card the\r\nclaim that woman has a smaller brain than man, and that in other\r\nqualities, besides, she is behind man, hence her permanent inferiority\r\n(subordination) is demonstrated. It is certain that man and woman are\r\nbeings of different sexes; that they are furnished with different\r\norgans, corresponding to the sex purpose of each; and that, owing to the\r\nfunctions that each sex must fill to accomplish the purpose of Nature,\r\nthere are a series of other differences in their physiologic and psychic\r\nconditions. These are facts that none can deny and none will deny;\r\nnevertheless, they justify no distinction in the social and political\r\nrights of man and woman. The human race, society, consists of both\r\nsexes; both are indispensable to its existence and progress. Even the\r\ngreatest male genius was born of a mother, to whom frequently he is\r\nindebted for the best part of himself. By what right can woman be\r\nrefused equality with man?\r\n\r\nBased upon information furnished us by a medical friend, we shall here\r\nsketch with a few strokes the essential differences, that, according to\r\nleading authorities, manifest themselves in the physical and mental\r\nqualities of man and woman. The bodily size of man and woman stands, on\r\nan average, in the relation of 100 to 93.2. The bones of woman are\r\nshorter and thinner, the chest smaller, wider, deeper and flatter. Other\r\ndifferences depend directly upon the sex purpose. The muscles of woman\r\nare not as massive. The weight of the heart is 310 grains in man, 255 in\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the blood in man and woman is as follows: Water, man,\r\n77.19; woman, 79.11. Solid matter, man, 22.10; woman, 20.89. Blood\r\ncorpuscles, man, 14.10; woman, 12.79. Number of blood corpuscles in a\r\ncubic millimeter of blood, man, 4½ to 5 millions; woman, 4 to 4½\r\nmillions. According to Meynert, the weight of the brain of man is from\r\n1,018 to 1,925 grams; of woman, from 820 to 1,565; or in the relation of\r\n100 to 90.93. LeBon and Bischoff agree that, while weight of brain\r\ncorresponds with size of body, nevertheless short people have relatively\r\nlarger brains. With woman, the smaller size of the heart, the narrower\r\nsystem of blood vessels and probably also the larger quantity of blood,\r\nhas a lower degree of nourishment for its effect.[133] That, however,\r\nthe larger skulls of larger persons, coupled with the quantitative\r\nchanges occasioned by the size of the skull promote the vigor of the\r\nseveral sections of the brain is a matter that _cannot be\r\nasserted_.[134]\r\n\r\nOf 107 mentally healthy men and 148 women of the ages of 20 to 59, the\r\nweight of the brain per thousand was:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                            Average\r\n            Medulla                        Length in\r\n     Sex.  Oblongata. Cerebellum.  Pons.  Centimeters.\r\n\r\n    Men        790       107.5     102       166.5\r\n    Women      787       110.0     103       156.0\r\n\r\n\r\nThe absolute and relative excess in the weight of the cerebellum of\r\nwoman has an enormous significance. With animals that run immediately\r\nupon birth, the cerebellum is much more powerfully developed than with\r\nanimals that are born blind, are helpless, and that learn to walk with\r\ndifficulty. Accordingly, and in consequence of its connection with the\r\ncerebrum, subcortical center and the spinal cord, the cerebellum is a\r\nstation of the muscular and of the chief nervous system, by means of\r\nboth of which qualities we keep our equilibrium. The more massive\r\ncerebellum with woman, together with the comparative shortness and\r\ntenderness of her bones, explains her comparative quickness and easiness\r\nof motion, her quicker and higher co-ordination of the muscles for their\r\nfunctions, and her knack of quickly sizing up a situation, and finding\r\nher way in the midst of a confusion of associations. Woman is\r\nfurthermore aided in the latter faculty through the greater excitability\r\nof her cerebral cortex. Meynert says:--\r\n\r\n1. All structural anomalies associated with anaemia of the\r\nblood--including also a small heart and narrow arteries--should be\r\nconsidered as subject structural defects. Upon this depends not only the\r\nready exhaustibility of the cortex, but also the phenomena of\r\nirritability, named by Meynert, localized irritable weakness.\r\n\r\n2. The branches of blood vessels, supplying the subcortical centers from\r\nthe base, are short, thick, straight, palisade-like, while those on the\r\nsurface of the brain, supplying the cortex, run in long tortuous lines.\r\nAnd it is because of that, since with the increased length of the blood\r\nvessels the resistance to the propulsive force of the heart is\r\nincreased, that the subcortical centers, the moment fatigue supervenes,\r\nare better supplied with blood than the cortex, they are less readily\r\nfatigued than the more readily exhaustible cerebrum.\r\n\r\n3. Because of this and because of the more watery character of woman's\r\nblood and great extent of subcortical centers in woman in comparison\r\nwith cerebrum, the physical equilibrium of woman is more unstable than\r\nof man.\r\n\r\n4. All nerves (except the optic and olfactory, which spread out directly\r\nin the cortex, save some of their filaments terminating in the\r\nsubcortical centers) terminate in the subcortical center; the cortex of\r\nthe cerebrum acts as a checking organ for the subcortical center; as the\r\ncerebral cortex in woman, as already stated, is at a disadvantage not\r\nonly from the anatomical standpoint, but also in the quality of its\r\nblood supply, woman is not only more easily fatigued, but also more\r\nreadily excitable (irritable, nervous).\r\n\r\nThese facts explain, on the one hand, what is called the superior\r\nendowment of woman, and, on the other, her inclination to sudden changes\r\nof opinion, as well as to hallucinations and illusions. This state of\r\nunstable equilibrium between the _dura mater_ and the _pons_ becomes\r\nparticularly normal during menstruation, pregnancy, lying-in, and at her\r\nclimacteric. As a result of her physical organization, woman is more\r\ninclined to melancholy than man, and likewise is the inclination to\r\nmental derangement stronger with her; on the other hand, the male sex\r\nexcels her in the number of cases of megalomania.\r\n\r\nSuch, in substance, is the information furnished us by the authority\r\nwhom we have been quoting.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, in so far as the cited differences depend upon\r\nthe nature of the sex-distinctions, they can not be changed; in how far\r\nthese differences in the make-up of the blood and the brain may be\r\nmodified by a change of life (nourishment, mental and physical\r\ngymnastics, occupation, etc.) is a matter that, for the present, lies\r\nbeyond all accurate calculation. But this seems certain: _modern woman\r\ndiffers more markedly from man than primitive woman, or than the women\r\nof backward peoples, and the circumstance is easily explained by the\r\nsocial development that the last 1,000 or 1,500 years forced upon woman\r\namong the nations of civilization_.\r\n\r\nAccording to Lombroso and Ferrero, the mean capacity of the female\r\nskull, the male skull being assumed at 1,000, is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Negro          984              Slav           903\r\n    Australian     967              Gipsy          875\r\n    Hindoo         944              Chinese        870\r\n    Italian        921              German         838-897\r\n    Hollander      919 (Tiedemann)  Englishman     860\r\n    Hollander      883 (Davis)      Parisian       858\r\n\r\n\r\nThe contradictory findings for Hollanders and Germans show that the\r\nmeasurements were made on very different quantitative and qualitative\r\nmaterials, and, consequently, are not absolutely reliable. One thing,\r\nhowever, is evident from the figures: Negro, Australian and Hindoo women\r\nhave a considerably larger brain capacity than their German, English and\r\nParisian sisters, and yet the latter are all more intelligent. The\r\ncomparisons established in the weight of the brain of deceased men of\r\nnote, reveal similar contradictions and peculiarities. According to\r\nProf. Reclam, the brain of the naturalist Cuvier weighed 1,861 grams, of\r\nByron 1,807, of the mathematician Dirichlet 1,520, of the celebrated\r\nmathematician Gauss 1,492, of the philologist Hermann 1,358, of the\r\nscientist Hausmann 1,226. The last of these had a brain below the\r\naverage weight of that of women, which, according to Bischoff, weighs\r\n1,250 grams. But a special irony of fate wills it that the brain of\r\nProf. Bischoff himself, who died a few years ago in St. Petersburg,\r\nweighed only 1,245 grams, and Bischoff it was who most obstinately\r\ngrounded his claim of woman's inferiority on the fact that woman, on the\r\naverage, had 100 grams less brain than man. The brain of Gambetta also\r\nweighed considerably below the average female brain, it weighed only\r\n1,180 grams, and Dante, too, is said to have had a brain below the\r\naverage weight for men. Figures of the same sort are found in Dr.\r\nHavelock Ellis' work. According thereto, an every day person, whose\r\nbrain Bischoff weighed, had 2,222 grams; the poet Turgeniew 2,012; while\r\nthe third heaviest brain on the list belonged to an idiot of the duchy\r\nof Hants. The brain of a common workingman, also examined by Bischoff,\r\nweighed 1,925 grams. The heaviest woman's brains weighed 1,742 and 1,580\r\ngrams, two of which were of insane women.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion is, accordingly, justified that as little as size of body\r\njustifies inferences as to strength of body, so little does the weight\r\nof the brain-mass warrant inferences as to mental powers. There are very\r\nsmall animals (ants, bees) that, in point of intelligence, greatly excel\r\nmuch larger ones (sheep, cows), just as men of large body are often\r\nfound far behind others of smaller or unimposing stature. Accordingly,\r\nthe important factor is not merely the quantity of brain matter, but\r\n_more especially the brain organization, and, not least of all, the\r\nexercise and use of the brain power_.\r\n\r\nThe brain, if it is to fully develop its powers, must be diligently\r\nexercised, the same as any other organ, and also correspondingly fed.\r\nWhere this is not done, or where the training is turned into wrong\r\nchannels, instead of the sections of the understanding being developed,\r\nthose are developed in which imagination has its seat. In such cases,\r\n_not only is the organ stunted, but even crippled. One section is\r\ndeveloped at the expense of another._\r\n\r\nNo one, approximately familiar with the history of the development of\r\nwoman, will deny that, for thousands of years, woman has been and\r\ncontinues to be sinned against in that direction. When Prof. Bischoff\r\nobjects that woman could have trained her brain and intelligence as well\r\nas man did, he reveals unpardonable and unheard of ignorance on the\r\nsubject. The sketch, drawn in this work, of the position of woman in the\r\ncourse of the progress of civilization, explains fully how the thousands\r\nof years of continued male supremacy over woman are mainly responsible\r\nfor the great differences in the mental and physical development of the\r\ntwo sexes.\r\n\r\nOur naturalists should recognize that the laws of their science are\r\napplicable to man also, and to his evolution. The laws of evolution, of\r\nheredity, of adaptation, hold good with human beings as with all other\r\ncreatures of nature. Seeing that man is no exception in nature, the law\r\nof evolution must be applied to him also: forthwith light is shed upon\r\nwhat otherwise remains confused and dark, and, as such, becomes the fit\r\nsubject for scientific mysticism, or mystic science.\r\n\r\nThe training of the brain took its course with the different sexes\r\nwholly in conformity with the difference in the education of the two--if\r\nsuch a term as \"education\" is at all allowable, with regard to woman in\r\nparticular, during long stretches of the past, and the term \"bringing\r\nup\" is not the correcter. Physiologists are agreed that the organs of\r\nthought are located in the front part of the brain, and those especially\r\nof feeling and sentiment are to be looked for in the middle of the head.\r\nWith man the front, with woman the middle of the head is more developed.\r\n_The ideal of beauty, male and female, shaped itself accordingly._\r\nAccording to the Greek ideal, which is standard to this day, _woman has\r\na narrow, man a high and, particularly, broad forehead_,--and this ideal\r\nan expression of their own degradation, is so stamped on their minds,\r\nthat our women bewail a forehead that exceeds the average, as a\r\ndeformity in their appearance, and seek to improve nature by art,\r\ndrawing their hair over the sinning forehead, to make it look lower.\r\n\r\nIn a polemic in Nos. 39 and 40 of the \"Sozialdemokrat\" for 1890, which\r\nappeared in London, Sophie Nadejde had two articles in which she sought\r\nto refute the charges concerning the great inferiority of woman. She\r\nsays therein that Broca, a well known Parisian physiologist, measured\r\nthe cubic contents of 115 skulls from the eleventh and twelfth\r\ncenturies, and got an average of 1,426 cubic centimeters. The\r\nmeasurements of 125 skulls from the eighteenth century gave, however, an\r\naverage of 1,462 cubic centimeters. According to this, the conclusion\r\nwould be that, in the course of a few centuries, the brain had grown\r\nconsiderably. A measurement by Broca of skulls from the Stone Age\r\nresulted, however, in an average of 1,606 cubic centimeters for the\r\nskulls of men, and 1,581 for the skulls of women,--accordingly, both\r\nconsiderably larger than those of the eleventh, twelfth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies. Mrs. Nadejde concluded therefrom that Herbert Spencer was\r\nright when he claimed in his physiology that brain weight depended upon\r\nthe amount of motion and the variety of motions.\r\n\r\nThe lady furthermore emphasized the point that it depends a deal less on\r\nthe brain-mass than on the proportion in the two sexes of the\r\nbrain-weight to the weight of the body. Proceeding from these premises,\r\nit appeared that _the female brain was heavier than the male_. The\r\nargument on this head, Mrs. Nadejde presents in these words:\r\n\r\n\"Let us compare the average weights of the bodies, and let us take, as\r\nthe difference between man and woman only 8 kilograms, although many\r\nnaturalists, among them Gay, whom Delaunay quotes, takes 11 kilograms.\r\nAccording to the average weights of 9,157 American soldiers: 64.4\r\nkilograms (average weight of the male body): 56 kilograms (average\r\nweight of the female body) = 1,141 or 1.14, i. e., the average weight of\r\nwoman being taken as 100, that of man is represented by 114. According\r\nto the average weights of 12,740 Bavarians: 65.5 kilograms (average for\r\nmales): 57.5 (average for females) = 1,139 or 1.14 as above. Assuming\r\nthe average weight of woman as 100, that of man is found to be 114.\r\nAccording to the average weights of 617 Englishmen, 68.8 (average for\r\nmales): 60.8 (average for females) = 1,131, or 1.13; the average weight\r\nof woman being assumed as 100, that of man is found to be 113.[135]\r\n\r\n\"Accordingly, it appears that, under otherwise equal conditions, women\r\nhave ¼ per cent. of brain-mass in excess of men. That is to say, for\r\nevery 100 grams of female brain-mass, men should have 113 or 114 grams;\r\nin reality, however, they only have from 110 to 112 grams. The fact can\r\nbe put still more plastically: According to this calculation, _the male\r\nbrain falls short 25 to 51 grams of brain-mass_.[136]\r\n\r\n\"But L. Manouvrier proves more. He says:[137] 'The influence of the\r\nweight of the body strikes the eye when we note the figures among the\r\nvertebrates. The influence is equally manifest with man, and it is a\r\nwonder how so many naturalists have not yet recognized this truth, even\r\nafter it was illustrated and treated by others.\r\n\r\n\"'There are a number of facts that prove the influence of the size of\r\nthe body upon the weight of the brain. The lower races and of high\r\nstature, not only have a larger average weight of brain than the\r\nEuropean, but also is the number of large brains greater with them. We\r\nmust not imagine that the intelligence of a race is determined by the\r\nnumber of large brains: the Patagonians, Polynesians and Indians of\r\nNorth America (and according to the figures given above the people of\r\nthe Stone Age may be added) greatly surpass us Parisians and all races\r\nof Europe, not only in the number of large brains, but also in the large\r\naverage capacity of the skull.\r\n\r\n\"'The influence of the weight of the body upon the size of the brain is\r\nconfirmed by the fact that the small skull capacities are found among\r\nraces of slight stature, like the Bushmen, the Andamans, and the Hindoo\r\npariahs.'\r\n\r\n\"All scientists who have treated the brain question in a really\r\nscientific manner, have expressed themselves with greatest caution on\r\nthe difference shown by the two sexes. Other writers, on the contrary,\r\nespecially during the last years, have treated the question with such\r\nlevity, that it has been compromised in the public esteem. If there be\r\nany intellectual difference between man and woman, it must, at any rate,\r\nbe very slight, a physiologist like Stuart Mill having declared that he\r\nfailed to find the difference. Size of body, strength of muscle,\r\nmass--all of these present decided differences. Due to these differences\r\nwoman has been termed the defective sex; and authors who were not able\r\nto understand these manifest differences, presumed to establish a\r\nphysiologic difference; to solve a much more difficult and complex\r\nquestion, they raised their voices in praise of their own sex!\r\n\r\n\"It follows that the difference between the sexes in point of weight of\r\nbrain and capacity of skull, considered scientifically, can not be\r\nscored to the disadvantage of woman. All the facts point to the\r\nconclusion that the difference depends upon the weight of the body.\r\nThere is no anatomical reason to represent woman as a backward and, in\r\npoint of intelligence, subordinate being, compared with man. I shall\r\npresently prove this.\r\n\r\n\"The proportion between the weight of the brain and the height of the\r\nbody is smaller with the female than with the male sex.[138] But the\r\nfact is easily explained. The height of the body does not actually\r\nexpress the development, or, rather, the weight of the body.\r\n\r\n\"But when we compare the proportion of the brain-weights we find that\r\nwomen have more brain than men, in childhood as well as throughout life.\r\nThe difference is not great, but it would be much more considerable, if\r\nwe did not include in the weight of the body the fat, which is present\r\nin much larger quantity with women, and which, as an inert (inactive)\r\nmass, has no influence whatever upon the weight of the brain.\"\r\n\r\nLater, in 1883, L. Manouvrier published in the seventh number of the\r\n\"Revue Scientifique\" the following results of his investigations:--\r\n\r\n\"If we designate with 100 each the weight of the brain, thighbone,\r\nskull, and lower jawbone, we find the following weights for woman:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Brain            88.9\r\n    Skull            85.8\r\n    Lower jawbone    78.7\r\n    Thighbone        62.5\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is, furthermore, an established fact that the weight of the skeleton\r\n(without skull) differs as with the thighbone. Hence we may compare the\r\nweight of the brain with that of the thighbone. It follows from the\r\nfigures given above, that women have, relatively, 26.4 per cent. more\r\nbrain-mass.\r\n\r\n\"Let us express the figures herein given somewhat more plastically.\r\n\r\n\"If a man has 100 grams of brain-mass, woman should have, instead of\r\n100, only 62.5 grams; but she has 88.9 grams,--an excess of 26.4 grams.\r\nIt follows that if we accept 1,410 grams (according to Wagner) as the\r\naverage weight of the male brain, the female brain should weigh only\r\n961.25 grams, instead of 1,262: woman, accordingly, has 301.75 grams\r\nmore brain-mass than the proportion demands. If we take the figures of\r\nHuschel we find an excess of 372 grams; finally, the figures of Broca\r\ngive us an excess of 383 grams. _Under otherwise equal conditions woman\r\nhas between 300 and 400 grams more brain-mass than man.\"_\r\n\r\nAlthough it is by no means proven that, by reason of their brain-mass,\r\nwomen are inferior to men, it is no cause for wonder that, women are\r\nmentally such as we know them to-day. Darwin is certainly right when he\r\nsays that a list of the most distinguished men in poetry, painting,\r\nsculpture, music, science and philosophy side by side with a similar\r\nlist of the most distinguished women on the same fields will not bear\r\ncomparison with each other. But are we to wonder at that? _Wonderful\r\nwere it if it were otherwise._ For that reason Dr. Dodel-Zurich[139]\r\nsays with perfect right that matters would stand otherwise if through a\r\nnumber of generations women and men were educated equally, and trained\r\nin the exercise of those arts and of mental discipline. On an average,\r\nwoman is also weaker than man, which is by no means the case with many\r\nwild peoples.[140] What exercise and training from early youth are able\r\nto change in this matter, we may see in the circus women and female\r\nacrobats, who in courage, foolhardiness, dexterity and physical strength\r\nachieve marvelous feats.\r\n\r\nSeeing that such a development is a matter of the conditions of life and\r\neducation--or, to express it in the naked language of science, of\r\n\"breeding\"--it may be taken for certain that the application of these\r\nlaws to the physical and mental life of man would lead to the most\r\nbrilliant results, _the moment man sets his hand to the work with full\r\nconsciousness of his object and his aim_.\r\n\r\nAs plants and animals depend upon the conditions for existence that they\r\nlive under--promoted by favorable, checked by unfavorable ones--and as\r\nforcible conditions compel them to change their appearance and\r\ncharacter, provided such conditions are not unfavorable enough to\r\ndestroy them wholly, so it is with man. The manner in which a person\r\nmakes his living influences not his external appearance only, it\r\ninfluences also his feelings, his thoughts and his actions.[141] If,\r\naccordingly, man's unfavorable conditions of life--defective social\r\nconditions--are the cause of defective individual development, it\r\nfollows that _by changing his condition of life, man is himself\r\nchanged_. The question, therefore, is so to change the social conditions\r\nthat every human being shall be afforded the possibility for the full\r\nand unhampered development of his being; that the laws of evolution and\r\nadaptation, designated after Darwin as \"Darwinian,\" be consciously\r\nrendered effective to humanity. But this is possible only under\r\nSocialism.\r\n\r\nAs a thinking and intelligent being, _man must constantly, and conscious\r\nof his purpose, change, improve and perfect his social conditions,\r\ntogether with all that thereby hangs; and he must so proceed in this\r\nthat equally favorable opportunities be open to all_. Every individual\r\nmust be placed in a position to be able to develop his abilities and\r\nfaculties to his own as well as to the advantage of the collectivity;\r\nbut his may not be the power to injure either others or the\r\ncollectivity. His own and the advantage of others must be mutual.\r\n_Harmony of interests_ must be brought about; it must substitute the\r\nexisting _conflict of interests_ to the end that not even the thought\r\nmay be conceived of ruling and injuring others.\r\n\r\nDarwinism, as all genuine science, is eminently democratic.[142] If any\r\nof its advocates holds a contrary view, he only proves himself unable to\r\ngrasp its range. Its opponents, particularly the reverend clergy, who\r\never display a fine nose, the moment earthly benefits or injuries are\r\nimminent, have understood this well, and, consequently denounce\r\nDarwinism as Socialistic and Anarchistic. Also Prof. Virchow agrees with\r\nhis sworn enemies in this. In 1877, at the convention of naturalists in\r\nMunich, he played the following trump declaration against Prof.\r\nHaeckel:[143] \"The Darwinian theory leads to Socialism.\" Virchow sought\r\nto discredit Darwinism and to denounce it because Haeckel demanded the\r\nadoption of the theory of evolution in the schools. To teach natural\r\nscience in our schools in the sense of Darwin and of recent\r\ninvestigations, that is an idea against which are up in arms all those\r\nwho wish to cling to the present order of things. The revolutionary\r\neffect of these theories is known, hence the demand that they be taught\r\nonly in the circles of the select. We, however, are of the opinion that\r\nif, as Virchow claims, the Darwinian theories lead to Socialism, the\r\ncircumstance is not an argument against Darwin's theories, but in favor\r\nof Socialism. Never may a scientist inquire whether the conclusions from\r\nhis science lead to this or that political system, to this or that\r\nsocial system, nor seek to justify the same. His is the duty to inquire\r\nwhether the theory is right. _If it is that, then it must be accepted\r\nalong with all its consequences._ He who acts otherwise, be it out of\r\npersonal interest, be it out of a desire to curry favor from above, or\r\nbe it out of class and party interests, _is guilty of a contemptible\r\nact, and is no honor to science_. Science as a guild so very much at\r\nhome in our Universities, can only in rare instances lay claim to\r\nindependence and character. The fear of losing their stipends, of\r\nforfeiting the favor of the ruler, of having to renounce titles,\r\ndecorations and promotions cause most of the representatives of science\r\nto duck, to conceal their own convictions, or even to utter in public\r\nthe reverse of what they believe and know. If, on the occasion of the\r\nfestival of declaration of allegiance at the Berlin University, in 1870,\r\na Dubois-Reymond exclaimed: \"The Universities are the training places\r\nfor the life-guards of the Hohenzollern,\" one may judge how the majority\r\nof the others, who stand both in knowledge and importance far below\r\nDubois-Reymond,[144] think regarding the purpose of science. Science is\r\ndegraded to a maid-servant of the ruling powers.\r\n\r\nWe can understand how Prof. Haeckel and his disciples, such as Prof. O.\r\nSchmidt, v. Hellwald and others, defend themselves energetically against\r\nthe charge that Darwinism plays into the hands of Socialism; and that\r\nthey, in turn, maintain the contrary to be true: that Darwinism is\r\naristocratic in that it teaches that everywhere in Nature the more\r\nhighly developed and stronger organism dominates the lower. Seeing that,\r\naccording to these gentlemen, the property and cultured classes\r\nrepresent these more highly developed and stronger organisms in society,\r\nthey look upon the domination of these as a matter of course, being\r\njustified by nature.\r\n\r\nThis wing among our Darwinians has not the faintest notion of the\r\neconomic laws that sway capitalist society, whose blind will raises,\r\nwithout selecting either the best, or the ablest, or the most thorough,\r\noften the most scampish and corrupt; places him on top; and thus puts\r\nhim in a position to make the conditions of life and development most\r\nfavorable for his descendants, without these having as much as to turn\r\ntheir hands. Striking an average, under no economic system is the\r\nprospect poorer than under capitalism for individuals animated with good\r\nand noble qualities, to rise and remain above; and it may be added\r\nwithout exaggeration that the prospect grows darker in the measure that\r\nthis economic system approaches its apogee. Recklessness and\r\nunscrupulousness in the choice and application of the means, are weapons\r\ninfinitely more effective and promiseful of success than all human\r\nvirtues put together. To consider a social system, built upon such a\r\nbasis, a system of the \"fittest and best\" is a feat that only he can be\r\ncapable of whose knowledge of the essence and nature of such a society\r\nequals zero; or who, swayed by dyed-in-the-wool bourgeois prejudices,\r\nhas lost all power to think on the subject and to draw his conclusions.\r\nThe struggle for existence is found with all organisms. Without a\r\nknowledge of the circumstances that force them thereto, the struggle is\r\ncarried on unconsciously. Such a struggle for existence is found among\r\nmen also, within all social systems in which the sense of solidarity has\r\nvanished, or has not yet come to the surface. This struggle changes\r\naccording to the forms that the social relations of man to man assume in\r\nthe course of social evolution. In the course of this evolution it takes\r\non the form of a class struggle that is carried on upon an ever higher\r\nplane. But these struggles lead--and in this human beings differ from\r\nall other creatures--to an ever clearer understanding of the situation,\r\nand finally to the recognition of the laws that govern and control\r\ntheir evolution. _Man has in the end but to apply this knowledge to his\r\nsocial and political development, and to adapt the latter accordingly._\r\nThe difference between man and the brute is that _man may be called a\r\nthinking animal, the brute, however, is no thinking man_. It is this\r\nthat a large portion of our Darwinians can not, in their one-sidedness,\r\nunderstand. Hence the vicious circle in which they move.\r\n\r\nA work from the pen of Prof. Enrico Ferri[145] proves, especially as\r\nagainst Haeckel, that Darwinism and Socialism are in perfect harmony,\r\nand that it is a fundamental error on the part of Haeckel to\r\ncharacterize, as he has done down to latest date, Darwinism as\r\naristocratic. We are not at all points agreed with Ferri's work, and\r\nespecially do we not share his views with regard to the qualities of\r\nwoman, a matter in which he is substantially at one with Lombroso and\r\nFerrero. Ellis has shown in his \"Man and Woman\" that while the qualities\r\nof man and woman are very different, still they are of _equal value_,--a\r\nconfirmation of the Kantian sentence that man and woman only together\r\nconstitute the human being. This notwithstanding, the work of Ferri\r\ncomes quite _apropos_.\r\n\r\nProfessor Haeckel and his followers, of course, also combat the claim\r\nthat Darwinism leads to atheism, and we find them, after themselves\r\nhaving removed the Creator by all their scientific arguments and proofs,\r\nmaking hysterical efforts to smuggle him in again by the back door. To\r\nthis particular end, they construct their own style of \"Religion,\" which\r\nis then called \"higher morality,\" \"moral principles,\" etc. In 1882, at\r\nthe convention of naturalists at Eisenach, and in the presence of the\r\nfamily of the Grand Duke of Weimar, Prof. Haeckel made the attempt not\r\nonly to \"save religion,\" but also to represent his master Darwin as\r\n\"religious.\" The effort suffered shipwreck, as all will admit who read\r\nthe essay and the letter of Darwin therein quoted. Darwin's letter\r\nexpressed the reverse of that which Prof. Haeckel sought to make out,\r\nalthough in cautious words. Darwin was constrained to consider the\r\n\"religious sentiments\" of his countrymen, the English, hence he never\r\ndared to express his opinion openly upon religion. Privately, however,\r\nhe did so to Dr. L. Buechner, as became known shortly after the Weimar\r\nconvention, whom he frankly informed that _since his fortieth\r\nyear_--that is to say, since 1849--_he believed nothing, not having been\r\nable to find any proof for his belief_. During the last years of his\r\nlife Darwin supported an atheist paper published in New York.\r\n\r\nWoman is to take up the competitive struggle with man on the\r\nintellectual field also. She does not propose to wait till it please man\r\nto develop her brain functions and to clear the way for her. The\r\nmovement is well under way. Already has woman brushed aside many an\r\nobstacle, and stepped upon the intellectual arena,--and quite\r\nsuccessfully in more countries than one. The movement, ever more\r\nnoticeable, among women for admission to the Universities and High\r\nSchools, as well as for admission to the functions that correspond to\r\nthese studies, is, in the very nature of existing conditions, confined\r\nto the women of the bourgeois circles. The circles of the working-women\r\nare not directly interested therein: to them, these studies, together\r\nwith the posts attainable through them, are shut off. Nevertheless, the\r\nmovement and its success are of general interest, partly, because the\r\nmatter concerns a question of principle, affecting the position in\r\ngeneral of woman towards man, partly also because it will show what\r\nwoman is capable of achieving, even now, under conditions highly\r\nunfavorable to her development. Finally, the female sex has a special\r\ninterest herein, in cases of sickness, for instance, when they may\r\nconfide their ailments more freely to a physician of their own than to\r\none of the opposite sex. To a large number of women, female\r\npractitioners, are a positive benefit. The necessity of having to resort\r\nto male doctors in cases of illness, generally connected with physical\r\ndisturbances that flow from their sex peculiarities, frequently deters\r\nwomen from seeking timely aid, or any aid at all. Hence arise a number\r\nof troubles, not infrequently serious ones, not to the wives alone, but\r\nto their husbands as well. There is hardly a physician who has no cause\r\nto complain of this frequently criminal diffidence on the part of women,\r\nand their objection to state their complaint freely. All this is easy to\r\nunderstand; irrational, however, is the posture of the men, and of\r\nseveral physicians among them, who will not admit the justice and\r\nnecessity of the study of medicine, in particular, by women.\r\n\r\nFemale doctors are no new sight. Among most of the ancient peoples, the\r\nold Germans in particular, it was upon woman that the healing cares\r\ndevolved. There were female physicians and operators of great repute\r\nduring the ninth and tenth centuries in the Arabian Kingdom,\r\nparticularly among the Arabians (Moors) in Spain, where they studied at\r\nthe University of Cordova. The pursuit by women of scientific studies at\r\nseveral Italian Universities--Bologna and Palermo, for instance,--was\r\nlikewise due to Moorish influence. Later, when the \"heathen\" influence\r\nvanished from Italy, the practice was forbidden. In 1377 the faculty of\r\nthe University of Bologna decreed:\r\n\r\n\"And whereas woman is the fountain of sin, the weapon of the devil, the\r\ncause of man's banishment from Paradise and the ruin of the old laws;\r\nand whereas for these reasons all intercourse with her is to be\r\ndiligently avoided; therefore do we interdict and expressly forbid that\r\nany one presume to introduce in the said college any woman whatsoever,\r\nhowever honorable she be. And if, this notwithstanding, any one should\r\nperpetrate such an act, he shall be severely punished by the Rector.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, down to this day, Christian clergymen, of both Protestant and\r\nCatholic confession, are among the most zealous enemies of the pursuit\r\nof scientific studies by woman. The fact was shown in the debates of the\r\nGerman Reichstag on the admission of women to the study of medicine; it\r\nis furthermore shown by the reports of the Evangelical convention, held\r\nin the spring of 1894 in Frankfurt-on-the-Main, where clerical\r\nmouth-pieces protested sharply against allowing women equal rights in\r\nthe discussions of the convention.\r\n\r\nThe admission of women to the pursuit of University professions has,\r\nabove all, the result of exercising a beneficent influence upon the\r\nindustry of the male youth. As admitted from different quarters, the\r\nambition of the male students leaves much to be wished for. That alone\r\nwere a great gain. Their morals also would be greatly improved: the\r\ninclination to drunkenness and brawling, as well as habitual\r\ndissipations in taverns, so common among our students, would receive a\r\nsevere blow: the institutions whence mainly proceed our political\r\npilots, judges, district attorneys, higher police officers, clergymen\r\nand members of legislatures would acquire a tone better in keeping with\r\nthe purpose for which these institutions are established and supported.\r\nAccording to the unanimous opinion of impartial people, qualified to\r\njudge, an improvement in this tone is a crying need of the hour.\r\n\r\nThe number of the countries that admit women to the Universities and\r\nHigh Schools has been greatly on the increase during the last twenty\r\nyears; nor can any country, that lays claim to being a member of\r\ncivilization, shut its ears in the long run to the demand. Ahead of all\r\nwent the United States; Russia followed--two political systems that\r\npresent in all respects the strongest contrasts; that notwithstanding,\r\nboth were guided by the identical views with regard to the equal rights\r\nof woman. In the North American Union, women are to-day admitted in all\r\nthe States to University studies,--in Utah since 1850, Iowa since 1860,\r\nKansas since 1866, Wisconsin since 1868, Minnesota since 1869,\r\nCalifornia and Missouri since 1870, Ohio, Illinois and Nebraska since\r\n1871; since then all the other States followed in rapid succession. In\r\nkeeping with the extension of female studies, woman conquered her place\r\nin the United States. According to the census of 1890, there were in the\r\ncountry 2,348 female physicians and surgeons, 2,136 female architects,\r\n580 female journalists, 300 female writers, 165 female ministers, 110\r\nfemale lawyers.[146]\r\n\r\nIn Europe, Switzerland, principally, opened its Universities to women.\r\nThere the number of female students grew, since 1887, as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Total     Female\r\n      Year.                Students.  Students.\r\n    1887                     2,229      167\r\n    1888                     2,339      206\r\n    1889                     2,412      196\r\n    1890                     2,552      248\r\n    1891                     2,889      297\r\n    1892                     3,076      318\r\n    1893                     3,307      451\r\n    1893-94 (Winter course)  3,609      599\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the participation of women in University studies increased\r\nconsiderably in the interval between 1887-1894. In 1887 the number of\r\nfemale students was 7.5 per cent. of the total number of students; in\r\n1893-1894, however, it had risen to 16.6 per cent. In 1887, there were,\r\namong 744 medical students, 79 women, or 10.6 per cent.; in the winter\r\ncourse of 1893-1894, there were, of 1,073 medical students, 210 women,\r\nor 19.6 per cent. In the department of philosophy, in 1887, there were,\r\nof 530 students, 41 women, or 7.8 per cent.; in 1893-1894, there were,\r\nof 1,640 students, 381 women, or 23.2 per cent. The large majority of\r\nthe female students in Switzerland are foreigners, among them many\r\nGermans, whose number increases almost yearly. The example of\r\nSwitzerland was followed in the early seventies by Sweden; in 1874 by\r\nEngland, in so far as medical colleges for women have been established.\r\nNevertheless, it was not until 1881 that Oxford, and 1884 that Cambridge\r\ndecided to admit female students. Italy followed in 1876, then Norway,\r\nBelgium, France and Austria. In Paris, during 1891, there were 232\r\nfemale students, mostly of medicine. Of these female students, 103 were\r\nRussian, 18 French, 6 English, 3 Roumanian, 2 Turk, and 1 each from\r\nAmerica, Greece and Servia. In the department of philosophy there were\r\n82 French female students and 15 foreigners matriculated.\r\n\r\nAs it will have been noticed, even Turkey is represented among the\r\nfemale students. There, more than anywhere else, are female physicians\r\nneeded, due to the position that custom and religion assign to woman as\r\nagainst man. The same reason caused Austria also to open Universities to\r\nfemale students, in order that the Mohammedan women of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina might enjoy medical attendance. Even Germany, whose\r\n\"pig-tail\" was thickest, i. e., where the disfavor towards admitting\r\nwomen to the Universities was most bitter, has been compelled to fall in\r\nline with progress. In the spring of 1894, the first female student\r\npassed her examination in Heidelberg for the degree of Doctor of\r\nPhilosophy, and a second one in the fall of the same year in Göttingen.\r\nIn Karlsruhe and Berlin, High Schools were established to prepare women\r\nfor the Universities; finally in the summer of 1894, the Prussian\r\nMinister of Public Worship issued regulations for the remodelling of the\r\nhigher instruction of girls, looking for their preparation for the study\r\nof medicine. Also India has furnished a small contingent of female\r\nstudents. Obviously, there is progress everywhere.\r\n\r\nAll medical authorities are agreed that women render the best service as\r\nnurses of the sick, aye, that they positively can not be got along\r\nwithout. In an address, delivered by Prof. Ziemssen a few years ago, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Above all, see to it, gentlemen, in your practice that you have\r\nthorough, well trained, kind-hearted, characterful female nurses.\r\nWithout them, all your sacrifices of time and effort are idle.\"\r\n\r\nIn the September, 1892, issue of the \"German Review\", Prof. Virchow thus\r\nexpressed himself in favor of female nurses:\r\n\r\n\"That the post of real responsibility at the sick-bed shall fall to\r\nwoman is, in my opinion, a principle that should be enforced in all our\r\nhospitals. In the hands of a cultivated, womanly, trained person the\r\ncare of even a sick man is safer than in those of a man.\"\r\n\r\nIf woman is fit for the extraordinarily difficult service of nurse, a\r\nservice that places a heavy strain upon patience and self-sacrifice, why\r\nshould she not be also fit for a physician?\r\n\r\nAbove all, the idea must be resisted that women shall be educated for\r\nphysicians by separate courses of study, i. e., separated from the male\r\nstudents,--a plan that Frau Mathilde Weber of Tübingen has declared\r\nherself satisfied with.[147] If the purpose be to degrade the female\r\nphysicians, from the start, to the level of physicians of second or\r\nthird rank, and to lower them in the eyes of their male colleagues,\r\nthen, indeed, that is the best method. If it is no violation of \"ethics\"\r\nand \"morality\" that female nurses assist in the presence of male\r\nphysicians at the performance of all possible operations upon male and\r\nfemale subjects, and on such occasions render most useful service; if it\r\nis \"ethically\" and \"morally\" permissible that dozens of young men, as\r\nstudents and for the sake of their studies, stand as observers at the\r\nbed of a woman in travail, or assist at the performance of operations on\r\nfemale patients, then it is absurd and laughable to deny such rights to\r\nfemale students.\r\n\r\nSuch prudery in natural things is the rage, particularly in Germany,\r\nthis big children's play-room. The English, discredited by reason of the\r\nsame qualities, may, nevertheless, be our teachers in the treatment of\r\nnatural things.\r\n\r\nIn this direction, it is the United States, in particular, that furnish\r\nthe example most worthy of imitation. There, and to the utter horror of\r\nour learned and unlearned old fogies of both sexes, High Schools have\r\nexisted for decades, at which both sexes are educated in common. Let us\r\nhear with what result. President White of the University of Michigan\r\ndeclared as early as the middle of the seventies: \"The best pupil in\r\nGreek, for several years, among 1,300 students, has been a young lady;\r\nthe best pupil in mathematics in one of the strongest classes of our\r\nInstitute is, likewise, a young lady; and several among the best pupils\r\nin natural science and the sciences in general are likewise young\r\nladies.\" Dr. Fairchild, President of Oberlin College in Ohio, where over\r\na thousand students of both sexes are instructed in common, said at\r\nabout the same time: \"During my incumbency of eight years as professor\r\nof ancient languages--Latin, Greek, and Hebrew--also in the ethical and\r\nphilosophic studies, and during my incumbency of eleven years in\r\nabstract and applied mathematics, I have never noticed any difference in\r\nthe two sexes except in the manner of reciting.\" Edward H. Machill,\r\nPresident of Swarthmore College in Delaware County, Pa., and author of a\r\npamphlet,[148] from which these facts are taken, says that, after an\r\nexperience of four years, he had arrived at the conclusion that, with an\r\neye to both manners and morals, the education of the two sexes in common\r\nhad given the best results. Many a pig-tail has yet to be cut off in\r\nGermany before common sense shall have broken its way through here.\r\n\r\nMore recently, lively controversies have arisen in the literature of\r\nalmost all countries of civilization on the question whether woman could\r\nachieve intellectually as much as man. While some, by dint of great\r\nacumen and with the aid of facts supposed to be proofs, deny that such\r\nis possible, others maintain that, on many fields, it undoubtedly is the\r\ncase. It is claimed that, generally speaking, woman is endowed with\r\nqualities that man is deficient in, and _vice versa_: the male method of\r\nreasoning is reflective and vigorous, woman's, on the contrary,\r\ndistinguishes itself by swiftness of perception and quickness of\r\nexecution. Certain it is that woman finds her way more quickly in\r\ncomplicated situations, and has more tact than man. Ellis, who gathered\r\nvast materials upon this question, turned to a series of persons, who\r\nhad male and female students under their guidance for many years, and\r\nquestioned them on their opinion and experience. McBendrick of Glasgow\r\nanswered him: \"After having taught female students for twenty years, I\r\nwould sum up my observations with the statement that many women\r\naccomplish as much as men in general, and that many men do not\r\naccomplish as much as the female average.\" Other opinions in Ellis' book\r\nare less favorable, but none is unfavorable. According to the Yearbook\r\nof Berlin for 1870, pp. 69-77, investigation showed girls to be stronger\r\nin the sense of space, boys at figures; the girls excelled in the\r\ntelling of stories, the boys in the explaining of religious principles.\r\nWhatever the way these questions may be turned and twisted, the fact\r\nappears that the two sexes supplement each other; the one is superior on\r\none, the other on some other field, while on a number of others there\r\nis no difference in point of sex, but only in point of individual.\r\n\r\n_It follows, furthermore, that there is no reason for confining one sex\r\nto a certain field, and prescribing to it the course of development that\r\nit shall pursue, nor that, based on differences in natural bent, in\r\nadvantages and in defects, which mutually equalize themselves,\r\nprivileges may be deducted for one sex, hindrances for another.\r\nConsequently--equality for all, and a free field for each, with a full\r\nswing according to their capacity and ability._\r\n\r\nBased upon the experience made during the last decades in the higher\r\nstudies of woman, there is no longer any valid reason against the same.\r\nThe teacher can do much, by the manner in which he teaches, to affect\r\nthe attitude of his male and female pupils. Women, who devote themselves\r\nto a science, are often animated with an earnestness and will-power in\r\nwhich they excel most other students. The zeal of the female students\r\nis, on an average, greater than that of the male.\r\n\r\nIn reality, it is wholly different reasons that cause most professors of\r\nmedicine, University teachers, in general, to take a hostile stand\r\ntowards female students. They see in it a \"degradation\" of science,\r\nwhich might lose in the esteem of the narrow-minded masses, if the fact\r\nwere to transpire that female brains also could grasp a science, which,\r\nuntil then, was confined to the select of the male sex only.\r\n\r\nAll claims to the contrary notwithstanding, our Universities, along with\r\nour whole system of education, are in poor plight. As, at the public\r\nschool, the child is robbed of valuable time by filling his brain with\r\nmatters that accord neither with common sense nor scientific experience;\r\nas a mass of ballast is there dumped into him that he can not utilize in\r\nlife, that, rather, hampers him in his progress and development; so\r\nlikewise is it done in our higher schools. In the preparatory schools\r\nfor the Universities a mass of dry, useless matter is pounded into the\r\npupils. These matters, that the pupils are made to memorize, take up\r\nmost of their time and engage their most precious brain-power;\r\nwhereupon, at the University, the identical process is carried on\r\nfurther. They are there taught a mass of antiquated, stale, superfluous\r\nlore, along with comparatively little that is valuable. The lectures,\r\nonce written, are reeled off by most of the professors year after year,\r\ncourse after course, the interlarded witticisms included. The high\r\nministry of education becomes with many, an ordinary trade; nor need the\r\nstudents be endowed with great sagacity to find this out. Furthermore,\r\ntradition regarding University life sees to it that the young folks do\r\nnot take their years of study too seriously, and many a youth, who would\r\ntake them seriously, is repelled by the pedantic and unenjoyable style\r\nof the professors. The decline in the zeal to learn and to study is a\r\nfact generally noticed at all our Universities and higher schools, and\r\nis even cause for serious concern with those in authority. Intimately\r\nconnected therewith is the \"grafting\" tendency, which, in these days of\r\nours, so poor in character, makes great progress and grows ever ranker\r\nin the higher schools. To have \"safe views\" takes the place of\r\nknowledge, and the poison spreads. To be a \"patriot,\" that is to say, a\r\nperson without a mind of his own, who carefully takes his cue from\r\nabove, sees how the wind blows there, and trims his sails accordingly,\r\nbends and crawls,--such a person is more considered than one of\r\ncharacter and knowledge. When the time for examination approaches, the\r\n\"grafter\" crams for a few months what seems most indispensible, in order\r\nto squeeze through. When, finally, examination has been happily passed\r\nand an office or professional post is secured, most of these\r\n\"ex-students\" work along in a merely mechanical and journeyman style,\r\nand are then highly offended if one, who was not a \"student,\" fails to\r\ngreet them with the greatest respect, and to treat them as specimens of\r\nsome other and higher race. The majority of the members of our so-called\r\nhigher professions--district attorneys, judges, doctors, professors,\r\nGovernment officials, artists, etc.,--_are mere journeymen at their\r\ntrades, who feel no need of further culture, but are happy to stand by\r\nthe crib_. Only the industrious man discovers later, but only then, how\r\nmuch trash he has learned, often was not taught the very thing that he\r\nneeded most, and has to begin to learn in good earnest. During the best\r\ntime of his life he has been pestered with useless or even harmful\r\nstuff. He needs a second part of his life to rub all this off, and to\r\nwork himself up to the height of his age. Only then can he become a\r\nuseful member of society. Many do not arrive beyond the first stage;\r\nothers are stranded in the second; only a few have the energy to reach\r\nthe third.\r\n\r\nBut \"decorum\" requires that the mediaeval trumpery and useless\r\ncurriculum be retained; and, seeing, moreover, that women, as a\r\nconsequence of their sex, are from the start excluded from the\r\npreparatory schools, the circumstance furnishes a convenient pretext to\r\nshut the doors of the University lecture rooms in their faces. In\r\nLeipsic, during the seventies, one of the most celebrated professors of\r\nmedicine made the undisguised confession to a lady: _\"The gymnasium\r\n(college) training is not necessary to the understanding of medicine.\r\nThis is true. Nevertheless, it must be made a condition precedent for\r\nadmission, in order that the dignity of science may not suffer.\"_\r\n\r\nGradually is the opposition to the necessity of a \"classical\" education\r\nfor the study of medicine being felt in Germany also. The immense\r\nprogress made in the natural sciences, together with their importance to\r\nlife, require an early initiation. Collegiate education, with its\r\npreference for the classic languages, Greek and Latin, looks upon the\r\nnatural sciences as subordinate and neglects them. Hence, the students\r\nare frequently devoid of the necessary and preparatory knowledge in\r\nnatural science that are of decided importance in certain studies,\r\nmedicine, for instance. Against such a one-sided system of education\r\nopposition begins to spring up even in the circles of teachers, as\r\nproven by a declaration published in the autumn of 1894 by about 400\r\nteachers of the German High Schools. Abroad, in Switzerland, for\r\ninstance, the leading place has long since been given to the studies in\r\nnatural science, and any one, even without a so-called classic\r\neducation, is admissible to the study of medicine, provided otherwise\r\nsufficiently equipped in natural science and mathematics. Similarly in\r\nRussia and the United States.\r\n\r\nIn one of his writings, the late Pro. Bischoff gave \"_the rudeness of\r\nthe students_\" as the reason why he did not recommend the study of\r\nmedicine to women. He certainly was a good judge of that. In another\r\nplace, and also quite characteristically, he says: \"Why should not one\r\n(as professor) now and then allow some interesting, intelligent and\r\nhandsome woman to attend a lecture upon some simple subject?\"--an\r\nopinion that v. Sybel evidently shares and even expresses: \"Some men\r\nthere are who have rarely been able to refuse their assistance and help\r\nto a female pupil, greedy of knowledge and not uncomely.\"\r\n\r\nPity the words spent in the refutal of such \"reasons\" and views! The\r\ntime will come, when people will trouble themselves about the rudeness\r\nof the \"cultured\" as little as about the old fogyism and sensuous lusts\r\nof the learned, but will do what common sense and justice bid.\r\n\r\nIn Russia, after much pressure, the Czar gave his consent in 1872 to the\r\nestablishment of a female faculty in medicine. The medical courses were\r\nattended in the period of 1872-1882 by 959 female students. Up to 1882\r\nthere were 281 women who had filled the medical course; up to the\r\nbeginning of 1884, there were 350; about 100 came from St. Petersburg.\r\nOf the female students who visited the faculty up to 1882, there were 71\r\n(9.0 per cent.) married and 13 (1.6 per cent.) widows; of the rest, 116\r\n(15.9 per cent.) married during their studies. Most of the female\r\nstudents, 214, came from the ranks of the nobility and government\r\nofficials; 138 from the merchant and privileged bourgeois class; 107\r\nfrom the military, 59 from the clergy, and 54 from the lower classes of\r\nthe population. Of the 281 female physicians, who, up to 1882, had\r\nfinished their studies, 62 were engaged by several Zemstvos; 54 found\r\noccupation in clinics; 12 worked as assistants at medical courses; and\r\n46 took up private practice. It is noteworthy that, of these female\r\nstudents, more than 52 per cent. had learned neither Latin nor Greek,\r\nand yet they did as good work as the men. This notwithstanding, female\r\nstudy was far from being a favorite among the Russian Government\r\ncircles, until the great services rendered by the female physicians on\r\nthe theater of war in Turkey during the Russo-Turkish campaign of\r\n1877-1878, broke the ice. At the beginning of the eighties, female\r\nstudies took great increment in Russia: thousands of female pupils\r\ndevoted themselves to several branches. Due thereto, and due especially\r\nto the fact that thereby free ideas were breaking through, threatening\r\nto endanger despotism, the female courses were suppressed by an imperial\r\nukase of May 1, 1885, after the lives of the female students had for\r\nsome time been made as hard as possible.[149] Since then, resolutions\r\nhave been adopted at several Russian conventions of physicians to\r\npetition for the re-opening of the medical courses for women,--more than\r\na German convention of physicians would do. As yet the attempt in Russia\r\nhas remained unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nIn Finland, a country that, although belonging to Russia, occupies an\r\nexceptionally privileged position in the Russian system, 105 female\r\nstudents were at the University of Helsingfors during the winter course\r\nof 1894-1895, as against 73 in the summer course of 1894. Of these 105\r\nfemale students, 47 were entered in the faculty of philosophy of history\r\nand 45 in that of mathematics; 5 studied medicine, a strikingly small\r\nfigure compared with elsewhere; 7 law; and 1 theology.\r\n\r\nAmong the women who distinguished themselves in their studies, belong\r\nthe late Mrs. v. Kowalewska, who received in 1887 from the Academy of\r\nSciences in Paris the first prize for the solution of a mathematical\r\nproblem, and since 1884 occupied a professorship of mathematics at the\r\nUniversity of Stockholm. In Pisa, Italy, a lady occupies a professorship\r\nin pathology. Female physicians are found active in Algiers, Persia and\r\nIndia. In the United States there are about 100 female professors, and\r\nmore than 70 who are superintendents of female hospitals. In Germany\r\nalso the ice has been broken to the extent that in several\r\ncities--Berlin, Dresden, Leipsic, Frankfurt-on-the-Main, etc.,--female\r\nphysicians, especially dentists, are in successful practice.\r\n\r\nWith regard to energy and capacity in the scientific studies, England,\r\nin particular, can cite a series of handsome results. At the\r\nexaminations in 1893, six women and six men held the highest marks. The\r\nexaminations on art and on the theory and history of pedagogy were\r\npassed by nine women and not one man. At Cambridge, ten women sustained\r\nthe severest test in mathematics. According to the sixteenth report of\r\nexaminations of female students in Oxford, it appears that 62 women\r\nsustained the test of the first class, and 82 that of the second class;\r\nmoreover the honorary examinations were sustained by more than one-half\r\nof the female candidates. Surely extraordinarily favorable results.\r\n\r\nHostility to competition with women is particularly pronounced in\r\nGermany, because here the military turns out every year such a large\r\nnumber of mustered-out officers and under-officers as aspirants for the\r\nCivil Service, where there is little room for applicants from other\r\nsources. If, however, women are employed, and then at lower salaries,\r\nthey appear to the already jealous men in a light that is doubly\r\nbad,--first, as cheap labor; then as lowerers of wages. An extensive\r\nfield of activity have women gained as teachers, a field for which, on\r\nthe whole, they are well fitted. This is particularly the case in the\r\nUnited States, where, in 1890, of 363,000 teachers, 238,000 were\r\nfemale.[150] In Berlin there were on January 1, 1892, along with 194\r\nRectors and 2,022 teachers, 1,024 pedagogically educated and 642\r\ntechnical female teachers, inclusive of their helpers. In England,\r\nFrance and the United States there are, furthermore, since several\r\nyears, women successfully engaged in the important service of Factory\r\nInspectors, a move that, in view of the enormous proportions that female\r\nlabor is assuming ever more in the trades and industries, is well\r\njustified and becomes everywhere a necessity.\r\n\r\nAt the Chicago Exposition of 1893 women, furthermore, distinguished\r\nthemselves in that, not only did female architects draw the plan and\r\nsuperintend the execution of the magnificent building for the exhibition\r\nof female products, but that women also appeared as independent\r\noperators in a number of products of art, which provoked general\r\napplause, and even astonishment. Also on the field of invention have\r\nwomen distinguished themselves, a subject on which, as early as 1884, a\r\npublication in the United States imparted information to the world by\r\nproducing a list of female inventors. According to the list, the\r\nfollowing inventions were made or improved by women: an improved\r\nspinning machine; a rotary loom, that produces three times as much as\r\nthe ordinary loom; a chain elevator; a winch for screw steamers; a\r\nfire-escape; an apparatus for weighing wool, one of the most sensitive\r\nmachines ever invented and of priceless value in the woolen industry; a\r\nportable water-reservoir to extinguish fires; a device for the\r\napplication of petroleum in lieu of wood and coal as fuel on steamers;\r\nan improved catcher of sparks and cinders on locomotives; a signal for\r\nrailroad crossings; a system for heating cars without fire; a\r\nlubricating felt to reduce friction on railroad cars; a writing machine;\r\na signal rocket for the navy; a deep-sea telescope; a system for\r\ndeadening noise on railroads; a smoke-consumer; a machine to fold paper\r\nbags, etc. Many improvements in the sewing machines are due to women, as\r\nfor instance: an aid for the stretching of sails and heavy stuffs; an\r\napparatus to wind up the thread while the machine is in motion; an\r\nimprovement for the sewing of leather, etc. The last of these inventions\r\nwas made by a woman who for years kept a saddle and harness shop in New\r\nYork. The deep-sea telescope, invented by Mrs. Mather, and improved by\r\nher daughter, is an innovation of great importance: it makes possible\r\nthe inspection of the keel of the largest ship, without bringing the\r\nsame on the dry-dock. With the aid of this glass, sunken wrecks can be\r\ninspected from the deck of a ship, and search can be made for\r\nobstructions to navigation, torpedoes, etc. Along with these practical\r\nadvantages, its application in science is full of promise.\r\n\r\nAmong the machines, the extraordinary complexity and ingenuity of whose\r\nconstruction excited great admiration in America and Europe, is one for\r\nmaking paper bags. Many men, leading mechanics among them, had until\r\nthen vainly sought to construct such a machine. A woman, Miss Maggie\r\nKnight, invented it. Since then, the lady invented also a machine to\r\nfold paper bags, that does the work of 30 persons. She herself\r\nsuperintends the construction of the machine in Amherst, Mass. That\r\nGerman women have made similar inventions is not yet known.\r\n\r\nThe movement among women has spread even to Japan. In the autumn of\r\n1892, the Japanese Parliament decided that it was forbidden to women to\r\nfigure as publishers or editors of newspapers, also of such papers as\r\nare devoted to fashions, cooking, education of children, etc. In Japan,\r\neven the unheard-of sight has been seen of a woman becoming the\r\npublisher of a Socialist paper. That was a little too much for the\r\nJapanese legislators, and they issued the above stated decree. It is,\r\nhowever, not forbidden to women to act as reporters for newspapers. The\r\nJapanese Government will succeed as little in denying their rights to\r\nwomen as its European rivals of equal mental make-up.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[124] On this subject, the law for protection of working-women, adopted\r\nby the people of the canton of Zurich in August, 1894, with 49,909 votes\r\nagainst 12,531, contains an excellent provision. The law makes it a\r\npenal offence for working-women to take from the shop, where they are\r\nemployed during the day, work to be done at home. This law goes further\r\nthan any other known to us for the protection of working-women. It also\r\nprescribes an extra pay of 25 per cent. for the extra hours fixed by\r\nlaw: the most effective means to check the evil of overwork.\r\n\r\n[125] The census of 1890 gives 3,914,571 women of at least 10 years of\r\nage engaged in gainful occupations in the United States; that is 17.6\r\nper cent. of the total population engaged in gainful occupations, and\r\n12.7 per cent. of the total female population of the country.\r\n\r\nAccording to the census of 1900 there were 5,319,912 women of at least\r\n10 years of age engaged in gainful occupations in the United States;\r\nthat is 18.2 per cent. of the total population engaged in gainful\r\noccupations, and 14.3 per cent. of the total female population of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nClassified by kinds of occupation, the census of 1900 shows: 977,336\r\nwomen engaged in agricultural pursuits; 430,576 in professional service;\r\n2,095,449 in domestic and personal service; 503,347 in trade and\r\ntransportation; 1,313,204 in manufacturing and mechanical pursuits.--THE\r\nTRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n[126] For the sake of verification, and especially with the view of\r\navoiding any serious discrepancy that might arise from a translation\r\nback into English from a German translation of the original English, an\r\nattempt was made to secure a transcript of the original of the above\r\ninteresting article. A serious difficulty was encountered. Besides the\r\nindefinite date, the abbreviated form, in which the German text gives\r\nthe name of the Maine paper quoted from--\"Levest.

Redgrave delivered in the end of December,\r\n1871 an address in Bradford, in the course of which he said: \"I have\r\nbeen struck for some time past by the altered appearance of the wool\r\nfactories. Formerly they were filled with women and children, now\r\nmachinery seems to be doing all the work. On Inquiry a manufacturer gave\r\nme the following information; 'Under the old system I employed 63\r\npersons; after the introduction of improved machinery I reduced my hands\r\nto 33, and, later, in consequence of new and extensive alterations, I\r\nwas able to reduce them from 33 to 13.' Thus, within a few years, a\r\nreduction of labor, amounting to almost 80 per cent. took place, with an\r\noutput at least as large as before.\" Many interesting items of\r\ninformation on this subject are found in Marx's \"Capital.\"\r\n\r\n[130] \"Original Property,\" chap. 20.\r\n\r\n[131] \"Bau und Leben des sozialen Körpers,\" Tübingen, 1878.\r\n\r\n[132] \"Husband and Wife,\" Dr. Havelock Ellis.\r\n\r\n[133] Possibly the opposite is the case. We repeat what we explained\r\nabove more extensively, that it is a widely diffused fact that women and\r\ngirls nourish themselves worse and are worse nourished than men and\r\nboys. There was a time when the fashion prevailed for woman to eat as\r\nlittle as possible; she was to have as \"etherial\" an appearance as\r\npossible; the conception of beauty in our upper class, even to-day, is\r\nto the effect that it is \"vulgar\" if a young girl or young woman have a\r\nblooming complexion, red cheeks and a vigorous frame. It is also known,\r\nthat with numberless women, under otherwise equal social conditions with\r\nmen, the food is greatly inferior. Out of ignorance and acquired\r\nprejudices, women expect incredible things of themselves, and the men\r\nencourage them therein. Such neglect and maltreatment of physical\r\nnutrition must have the very worst consequences, if carried on through\r\nmany generations by the very sex that, by reason of the heavy monthly\r\nlosses of blood and of the expenditure of energies, required by\r\npregnancy, child-birth and nursing, has its physique heavily taxed.\r\n\r\n[134] \"Men of genius are, as a rule, of inferior size and massive brain.\r\nThese are also the leading features of the child, and the general facial\r\nexpression as well as the temperament of such men recall the\r\nchild.\"--Dr. Havelock Ellis, \"Husband and Wife.\"\r\n\r\n[135] The corporal weights are taken from Taupinard's \"Anthropologie.\"\r\n\r\n[136] If, with the authority quoted by Delaunay, we assume 11 kilograms\r\nas the difference in weight between men and women, we would have found\r\n35 to 70 grams.\r\n\r\n[137] L. Manouvrier, \"Revue Scientifique,\" No. 23, June 3, 1882.\r\n\r\n[138] Quatrefages found the proportion to be slightly larger with woman\r\nthan with men. Thurman found the reverse, just as L. Manouvrier.\r\n\r\n[139] \"Die neuere Schöpfungsgeschichte.\"\r\n\r\n[140] Dr. Havelock Ellis furnishes a number of proofs of this fact in\r\nhis frequently quoted book. According thereto, woman, among wild and\r\nhalf-wild people, is not only equal to man in physical strength and size\r\nof body, but she is partly superior. On the other side, Ellis agrees\r\nwith others that, in consequence of our progress in civilization, the\r\ndifference in the capacity of the skull of the two sexes has steadily\r\nbecome more marked.\r\n\r\n[141] This is a discovery, first made by Karl Marx, and classically\r\ndemonstrated by him in his works, especially in \"Capital.\" The\r\nCommunistic Manifesto, that appeared in 1848, and was composed by K.\r\nMarx and Frederick Engels, is grounded upon this fundamental principle,\r\nand must be considered, to this day, as the norm for all agitational\r\nwork, and the most excellent of all.\r\n\r\n[142] \"The Hall of science is the Temple of democracy,\" Buckle, \"History\r\nof Civilization in England.\"\r\n\r\n[143] Ziegler, quoted above, denies that such is the meaning of\r\nVirchow's argument. His own quotation of Virchow's argument, however,\r\nconfirms the interpretation. Virchow said: \"Now, only picture to\r\nyourselves _how the theory of the descent of man presents itself in the\r\nhead of a Socialist_! (Laughter.) Yes, gentlemen, that may seem funny to\r\nsome; it is, however, a serious matter, and I hope that the theory of\r\nthe descent of man _may not bring upon us all the horrors that similar\r\ntheories have actually brought upon our neighboring country. At any\r\nrate, this theory, if consistently carried out, has a side of\r\nextraordinary gravity; and that Socialism has shown its sympathy\r\ntherewith, will, it is to be hoped, not have escaped you. We must be\r\nperfectly clear upon that._\" Now, then, we have simply done what Virchow\r\nfeared: we have drawn the conclusions from the Darwinian theories,\r\nconclusions that Darwin himself and a large portion of his followers\r\neither did not draw at all, or drew falsely. And Virchow warned against\r\nthe gravity of these theories, just because he foresaw that Socialism\r\nwould _and was bound to draw the conclusions that are involved in them_.\r\n\r\n[144] Dubois-Reymond repeated this sentence in February, 1883, to the\r\nattacks directed upon him, on the occasion of the anniversary\r\ncelebration of Frederick the Great.\r\n\r\n[145] \"Socialism and Modern Science (Darwin-Spencer-Marx).\"\r\n\r\n[146] According to the census of 1900, the figures for these respective\r\noccupations were: 7,387 female physicians and surgeons, 1,041 female\r\narchitects, designers and draftsmen, 2,193 female journalists, 5,984\r\nfemale literary and scientific persons, 3,373 female ministers, 2,193\r\nfemale lawyers.--THE TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n[147] \"Aerztinnen für Frauenkrankheiten, eine ethische und sanitäre\r\nNothwendigkeit,\" Berlin, 1893.\r\n\r\n[148] \"An Address upon the Co-education of the Sexes.\"\r\n\r\n[149] Neue Zelt, 1884, \"Das Frauenstudium In Russland.\"\r\n\r\n[150] The census of 1900 gives 327,614 female teachers and professors in\r\ncolleges, out of a total force of 446,133, leaving, accordingly, only\r\n118,519 men on this field.--THE TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nWOMAN'S CIVIC AND POLITICAL STATUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe social dependence of a rank or a class ever finds its expression in\r\nthe laws and political institutions of a country. Laws are the mirror in\r\nwhich is reflected a country's social condition, to the extent that the\r\nsame has been brought within definite rules. _Woman, as a subject and\r\noppressed sex, constitutes no exception to the principle._ Laws are\r\nnegative or positive. Negative in so far as they ignore the oppressed in\r\nthe distribution of privileges and rights, as though he did not exist;\r\npositive, in so far as they expressly assign his dependent position to\r\nthe oppressed, and specify possible exceptions in his favor.\r\n\r\nOur common law rests upon the Roman law, which, recognized persons only\r\nas property-holding beings. The old German law, which treated woman more\r\nworthily, has preserved its force only partially. In the French\r\nlanguage, the human being and the man are designated by the same word,\r\n\"_l'homme_\"; likewise in the English language,--\"_man_.\" French law\r\nknows the human being only as _man_; and so was it also until recently\r\nin England, where woman found herself in slavish dependence upon man. It\r\nwas similarly in Rome. There were Roman citizens, and wives of Roman\r\ncitizens, but no female citizens.\r\n\r\nImpossible were it to enumerate the numberless laws found on the motley\r\nmap of German common rights. Let a few instances suffice.\r\n\r\nAccording to the common law of Germany, the wife is a minor towards her\r\nhusband; the husband is her master, to whom she owes obedience. If the\r\nwoman is \"disobedient,\" then, according to the law of Prussia, the\r\nhusband of \"low\" estate has the right of \"moderate castigation.\" Men of\r\n\"high\" estate also there are said to be who arrogate such a right to\r\nthemselves. Seeing that nowhere is the force or number of the blows\r\nprescribed, the husband is the sovereign judge. The old city law of\r\nHamburg declares: \"For the rest, the right of _moderate castigation of\r\nthe wife by her husband_, of children by their parents, of pupils by\r\ntheir teachers, or servants by their masters and mistresses, is hereby\r\nadjudged just and permissible.\"\r\n\r\nSimilar provisions are numerous in Germany. According to the law of\r\nPrussia, the husband may prescribe to the wife _how long she shall\r\nsuckle her child_. In cases of disposing of the children, the father\r\nalone decides. If he dies, the wife is in most German States compelled\r\nto accept a guardian for her children: she herself is considered a\r\nminor, and is held unfit to attend to their education herself, even when\r\nshe supports her children by her property or labor. As a rule, her\r\nhusband administers her property, and, in cases of bankruptcy, the same\r\nis considered and disposed of as his own, unless a pre-marital contract\r\nsecures the property to her. Wherever the right of primogeniture\r\nattaches to landed property, a woman, even if she be the first born, can\r\nnot enter into possession if there be younger brothers. She can step in\r\nonly when she has no brothers. In most German States, a married woman\r\ncan contract only with the consent of her husband, unless she owns a\r\nbusiness in her own name, such as, according to more recent law, she is\r\nallowed to start. She is shut off from all public function. The Prussian\r\nlaw on associations forbids pupils and apprentices under 18 years of age\r\nand women to join political organizations. Until a few decades ago, the\r\nattendance of women among the public at open trials was forbidden by\r\nseveral German codes of criminal procedure. If a woman gives birth to an\r\nillegitimate child, it has no claim to support from its father if its\r\nmother accepted any presents from him during her pregnancy. If a woman\r\nis divorced from her husband, she continues to carry his name as a\r\nlasting memento, unless she marry again.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, hundreds of frequently contradictory laws are met with.\r\nAccording to the bill for the new civil laws of Germany, the\r\nadministration of the wife's property falls to the husband, unless the\r\nwife has secured her property to herself by special contract. This is a\r\nreactionary attitude, long since discarded by many other countries. On\r\nthe other hand, the wife is allowed to retain what she has earned by her\r\nown personal labor, and without assistance of her husband, or by the\r\nindependent conduct of a business enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn England, and down to 1870, the common law of the land gave to the\r\nhusband all the personal property of the wife. Only with regard to real\r\nestate were her proprietary rights safeguarded; the husband,\r\nnevertheless, had the right of administration and of use. At the bar of\r\nlaw, the English woman was a zero: she could perform no legal act, not\r\neven execute a valid testament; she was a veritable serf of her husband.\r\nA crime committed by her in his presence, he was answerable for: she was\r\nat all points a minor. If she injured any one, damage was assessed as if\r\ndone by a domestic animal: the husband was held. According to an address\r\ndelivered in 1888 by Bishop J. N. Wood in the chapel of Westminster, as\r\nrecently as a hundred years ago the wife was not allowed to eat at table\r\nor to speak before she was spoken to: above the bed hung a stout whip,\r\nthat the husband was free to use when the wife displayed ill temper:\r\nonly her daughters were subject to her orders: her sons saw in her\r\nmerely a female servant. Since 1870 and 1882, the wife is not merely\r\nsecured in the sole possession of the property that she brings with her,\r\nshe is also the proprietor of all she earns, or receives by inheritance\r\nor gift. These rights can be altered only by special contract between\r\nthe husband and wife. English legislation followed the example of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nParticularly backward is the civil law of France, of most of the Swiss\r\ncantons, of Belgium, etc., in the matter of woman's civic rights.\r\nAccording to the _Code Civil_, the husband could sue for divorce upon\r\nthe adultery of the wife; she, however, could institute such an action\r\nonly if the husband kept his concubine at his own home (Article 230).\r\nThis provision has been repealed by the divorce law of July 27, 1884,\r\nbut the difference continues in force in the French criminal code,--a\r\ncharacteristic manoeuvre on the part of the French legislator. If the\r\nwife is convicted of adultery, _she is punished with imprisonment for\r\nnot less than two months nor more than three years. The husband is\r\npunished only when, according to the spirit of the former Article 230 of\r\nthe Code Civil, he keeps a concubine under the domestic roof against the\r\nwish of his wife. If found guilty, he is merely fined not less than 100\r\nand not more than 1,000 francs._ (Arts. 337 and 339 _Code Penal_.) Such\r\ninequality before the law were impossible if but one woman sat in the\r\nFrench Parliament. A similar law exists in Belgium. The punishment for\r\nadultery by the wife is the same as in France; the husband is liable\r\nonly if the act of adultery is committed at the home of the married\r\ncouple: he may then suffer imprisonment for not less than one month, or\r\nmore than one year. Slightly juster is, accordingly, the law in Belgium\r\nthan in France; nevertheless, in the one place as in the other, there\r\nare two different standards of right, one for the husband, another for\r\nthe wife. Similar provisions exist, under the influence of French law,\r\nin Spain and Portugal. The civil law of Italy of 1865 enables the wife\r\nto obtain a divorce from her husband only if the husband keeps his\r\nconcubine at his own home, or at such other place where the concubine's\r\npresence must be considered in the light of a grave insult to the wife.\r\n\r\nIn France, Belgium and Switzerland, woman falls, as in Germany, under\r\nthe guardianship of her husband, the moment she marries. According to\r\nsection 215 of the _Code Civil_, she is not allowed to appear in Court\r\nwithout the consent of her husband and of two of her nearest male\r\nrelations, not even if she conducts a public business. According to\r\nsection 213 the husband must protect the wife, and she must yield\r\nobedience to him. There is a saying of Napoleon I. that typifies his\r\nidea concerning the status of woman: \"One thing is utterly un-French--a\r\nwoman that can do what she pleases.\"[151] In these countries,\r\nfurthermore, woman may not appear as a witness in the execution of\r\ncontracts, testaments or any notarial act. On the other hand--odd\r\ncontradiction--she is allowed to act as a witness in all criminal\r\ntrials, where her testimony may lead to the execution of a person.\r\n_Within the purview of the criminal code, she is on all hands considered\r\nof equal value, and she is measured for every crime or offense with the\r\nsame yard-stick as man._ The contradiction, however, does not penetrate\r\nthe wool of our legislators. As a widow, she may dispose of her\r\nproperty by testament; as witness to a testament, however, she is not\r\nadmissible in a number of countries; all the same, according to Art.\r\n1029 of the _Code Civil_, she may be appointed the executor of a will.\r\nIn Italy, since 1877, woman is qualified to appear as a witness in civil\r\nactions also.\r\n\r\nAccording to the law of the canton of Zurich, the husband is the\r\nguardian of his wife; he administers her property; and he represents her\r\nbefore third parties. According to the _Code Civil_, the husband\r\nadministers the property that the wife brings with her, he can sell her\r\nproperty, alienate it, load it with mortgages without requiring her\r\nconsent, or signature. Similar provisions exist in several other cantons\r\nof Switzerland besides Zurich, in France, Belgium, Luxemburg, the\r\nNetherlands, Spain, Portugal, Sweden, Denmark and also in a large part\r\nof Germany. Countries in which community of property may be excluded in\r\nmarriage are, besides parts of Germany, and a large part of Switzerland,\r\nAustria, Poland and the Baltic provinces. Countries in which the\r\nabsolute independence of married women exist with respect to their\r\nproperty are: Italy, Russia, Great Britain and Ireland. In Norway, a law\r\nof the year 1888, on the administration of the property of married\r\npersons, provides that a married woman has the same power to dispose of\r\nher property as unmarried women, only the law specifies a few\r\nexceptions. In this law the expression is used that _woman becomes\r\nun-free in marriage_. Who could blame her if, there also, as happens\r\nfrequently in France, women are seen to waive formal matrimonial\r\ncontracts?\r\n\r\nAccording to the law of Berne, what the married woman earns belongs to\r\nher husband. Similarly with most cantons of Switzerland, also in France\r\nand Belgium. The consequence is that the wife often finds herself in a\r\nstate of virtual slavery: the husband squanders with lewd women or in\r\nthe grog-shop what his wife makes: he incurs debts: gambles away his\r\nwife's earnings: leaves her and her children in want. He even has the\r\nright to demand from her employer the wages due her.\r\n\r\nBy the law of December 11, 1874, Sweden secures to the married woman the\r\nright to dispose freely of that which she earns by her personal effort.\r\nDenmark has raised the same principle to the force of a law; nor can,\r\naccording to Danish law, the property of the wife be seized to cover the\r\ndebts of the husband. Similarly runs the law of Norway of 1888.[152] The\r\nright of educating the children and of deciding thereupon is, according\r\nto the legislation of most countries, the attribute of the father: here\r\nand there a subordinate co-operation is granted the mother. The old\r\nRoman maxim, that stood in sharp contradiction to the principles\r\nprevalent during the mother-right, and that clothed the father alone\r\nwith rights and powers over the child, is to this day the key-note of\r\nlegislation on the subject.\r\n\r\nAmong the continental countries, woman holds the freest position in\r\nRussia,--due to the communistic institutions there still in existence,\r\nor to reminiscences of the same. In Russia, woman is the administrator\r\nof her property: she enjoys equal rights in the administration of the\r\ncommunity. Communism is the most favorable social condition to woman.\r\nThe fact transpired from the sketch of the age of the mother-right,\r\ngiven on previous pages.[153] In the United States women have conquered\r\nfull civil equality; they have also prevented the introduction of the\r\nEnglish and similar laws regulating prostitution.\r\n\r\nThe civic inequality of woman has provoked among the more advanced\r\nmembers of the female sex demand for political rights, to the end of\r\nwielding the power of legislation in behalf of their civic equality. It\r\nis the identical thought that moved the working class everywhere to\r\ndirect their agitation towards the conquest of the political powers.\r\nWhat is right for the working class can not be wrong for woman.\r\nOppressed, disfranchised, relegated everywhere to the rear, woman has\r\nnot the right only, she has the duty to defend herself, and to seize\r\nevery means she may deem fit to conquer a more independent position for\r\nherself. Against these efforts also the reactionary mob, of course,\r\nbristles up. Let us see how.\r\n\r\nThe great French Revolution, that, as is well known, started in 1789 and\r\nthrew all old institutions out of joint, conjured up a freedom of\r\nspirits such as the world had never seen before. Woman also stepped upon\r\nthe stage. During the previous decades immediately preceding the\r\noutbreak of the Revolution, many of them had taken part in the great\r\nintellectual struggle that then raged throughout French society. They\r\nflocked in swarms to the great scientific discussions, attended\r\npolitical and scientific meetings, and did their share in preparing the\r\nRevolution, where theory was to crystalize into fact. Most historians\r\nhave noted only the excesses of the Revolution,--and as always happens\r\nwhen the object is to cast stones at the people and arouse horror\r\nagainst them--have enormously exaggerated these to the end of all the\r\nmore readily extenuating the shameful transgressions of the ruling\r\nclass. As a rule, these historians have belittled the heroism and\r\ngreatness of soul, displayed also by many women in both camps. So long\r\nas the vanquishers remain the historians of the vanquished, it will ever\r\nbe thus.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1789, a number of women petitioned the National Assembly\r\n\"that equality be restored between man and woman, work and occupation be\r\ngiven them free, places be left for them that their faculties were fit\r\nfor.\"\r\n\r\nWhen in 1793 the Convention proclaimed \"_le droit de l'homme_\" (the\r\nRights of Man), the more far-seeing women perceived that these were only\r\nthe rights of males. Olympe de Gouges, Louise Lecombe and others\r\nparalleled these \"Rights of Man\" with 17 articles on the \"Rights of\r\nWoman,\" which, on the 28th Brumaire (November 20, 1793) they defended\r\nbefore the Commune of Paris upon the principle: \"If woman has the right\r\nto mount the scaffold, she must also have the right to mount the\r\ntribune.\" Their demands remained unheeded. When, subsequently, upon the\r\nmarch of monarchic Europe against the Republic, the Convention declared\r\nthe \"Fatherland in danger,\" and called upon all men, able to carry arms,\r\nto defend the Fatherland and the Republic, inspired Parisian women\r\noffered to do what twenty years later inspired Prussian women likewise\r\ndid against the domination of Napoleon,--defend the Fatherland, arms in\r\nhand. The radical Chaumette rose against those Parisian women and\r\naddressed them, asking: \"Since when is it allowed to women to renounce\r\ntheir sex and become men? Since when is it usage for them to abandon the\r\nsacred cares of their households, the cradles of their children, and to\r\nappear at public places, to speak from the tribunes, to step in the\r\nfiles of the troops,--in short, to fill duties that Nature has devolved\r\nupon man alone? Nature said to man: 'Be thou _man_! Racing, the chase,\r\nthe cultivation of the fields, politics and violent labors of all sorts\r\nare thy _privilege_!' It said to woman: 'Be thou _woman_! The care of\r\nthy children, the details of thy household, the sweet inquietudes of\r\nmotherhood,--that is thy _work_!' Unwise women, why wish you to become\r\nmen? Is not mankind properly divided? What more can you want? In the\r\nname of Nature, remain what you are; and, far from envying us the perils\r\nof so stormy a life, rest satisfied to make us forget them in the lap of\r\nour families, by allowing our eyes to rest upon the fascinating\r\nspectacle of our children, made happy by your tender care.\"\r\n\r\nThe women allowed themselves to be silenced, and went away. There can be\r\nno doubt that the radical Chaumette voiced the innermost sentiments of\r\nmost of our men, who otherwise abhor him. We also hold that it is a\r\nproper division of work to leave to men the defense of the country, and\r\nto women the care of the home and the hearth. In Russia, late in the\r\nfall of the year and after they have tended the fields, the men of whole\r\nvillage districts move to distant factories, and leave to the women the\r\nadministration of the commune and the house. For the rest, the\r\noratorical gush of Chaumette is mere phrases. What he says concerning\r\nthe labors of the men in the fields is not even correct: since time\r\nimmemorial down to to-day, woman's was not the easy part in agriculture.\r\nThe alleged labors of the chase and the race course are no \"labors\" at\r\nall: they are amusements of men; and, as to politics, it has perils for\r\nhim only who swims _against_ the stream, otherwise it offers the men at\r\nleast as much amusement as labor. It is the egoism of man that speaks in\r\nthat speech.\r\n\r\nAt about the same time when the French Revolution was under way, and\r\nengaged the attention of all Europe, a woman rose on the other side of\r\nthe Channel also, in England, to labor publicly in behalf of equal\r\nrights for her sex. She was Mary Wollstoncraft, born in 1759, and who,\r\nin 1790, published a book against Edmund Burke, the most violent enemy\r\nof the French Revolution. She later, 1792, wrote a second book--\"A\r\nVindication of the Rights of Woman\"--in which she took the stand for\r\nabsolute equality of rights for her sex. In this book she demands the\r\nsuffrage for women in the elections for the Lower House. But she met in\r\nEngland with even less response than did her sisters in France.\r\nRidiculed and insulted by her contemporaries, she went under after\r\ntrying ordeals. Before the Revolution it was the encyclopedist Condorcet\r\nwho principally took the field for the equal rights of both sexes.\r\n\r\nTo-day, matters lie somewhat differently. Since then, conditions have\r\nchanged mightily,--the position of woman along with them. Whether\r\nmarried or unmarried, more than ever before woman now has a deep\r\ninterest in social and political conditions. It can not be a matter of\r\nindifference to her whether the Government chains every year to the army\r\nhundreds of thousands of vigorous, healthy men; whether a policy is in\r\nforce that favors wars, or does not; whether the necessaries of life are\r\nmade dearer by taxes, that promote, besides, the adulteration of food,\r\nand are all the harder upon a family in the measure of its size, at a\r\ntime, at that, in which the means of life are most stingily measured for\r\nthe large majority. Moreover, woman pays direct and indirect taxes out\r\nof her support and her income. Again, the system of education is of\r\nhighest interest to her: it goes far towards determining the position of\r\nher sex: as a mother, she has a double interest therein.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as has been shown, there are to-day millions of women, in\r\nhundreds of pursuits, all of them with a lively personal interest in the\r\nmanner that our laws are shaped. Questions concerning the hours of work;\r\nnight, Sunday and child-labor; payment of wages and notice of discharge;\r\nsafety appliances in factory and shop; etc.--all are political questions\r\nthat concern them as well as the men. Workingmen know little or nothing\r\nabout conditions in many branches of industry, where women are mainly,\r\nor exclusively, engaged. Employers have all the interest in the world to\r\nhush up evils that they are responsible for. Factory inspection\r\nfrequently does not extend to branches of industry in which women are\r\nexclusively employed: such as it is, it is utterly inadequate: and yet\r\nthese are the very branches in which protective measures frequently are\r\nmost needed. It suffices to mention the workshops in which seamstresses,\r\ndressmakers, milliners, etc., are crowded together in our larger cities.\r\nFrom thence, hardly a complaint issues; thither no investigation has as\r\nyet penetrated. Finally, as a trader, woman is also interested in laws\r\non commerce and tariffs. There can, accordingly, be no doubt that woman\r\nhas an interest and a right to demand a hand in the shaping of things by\r\nlegislation, as well as man. Her participation in public life would\r\nimpart a strong stimulus thereto, and open manifold new vistas.\r\n\r\nSuch demands, however, are met with the curt rebuff: \"Women know nothing\r\nof politics, and most of them don't want to, either; neither do they\r\nknow how to use the ballot.\" True, and not true. True enough, until now,\r\nvery few women, in Germany at least, have ventured to demand political\r\nequality also. The first woman, who, as a writer, came out in its favor\r\nin Germany was, as far as we know, Frau Hedwig Dohm. More recently, it\r\nis mainly the Socialist working-women, who are vigorously agitating for\r\nthe idea; and their number is ever larger.\r\n\r\nNothing is proved with the argument that women have, until now, shown\r\nlittle interest in the political movement. The fact that, hitherto,\r\nwomen have troubled themselves little about politics, is no proof that\r\nthey should continue in the same path. The same reasons, advanced to-day\r\nagainst female suffrage, were advanced during the first half of the\r\nsixties in Germany against manhood suffrage. Even as late as 1863, the\r\nauthor of this book himself was of those who opposed manhood suffrage;\r\nfour years later he owed to it his election to the Reichstag. Thousands\r\nof others went through the same mill: from Sauls they became Pauls. Many\r\nare the men, who either do not care or do not know how to use their\r\nimportant political rights. And yet that fact was no reason to withhold\r\nthe suffrage from them, and can be none to now deprive them of it. At\r\nthe Reichstag elections in Germany, 25 to 30 per cent. of the qualified\r\nvoters do not vote at all. These non-voters are recruited from _all_\r\nclasses: among them are scientists and laborers. Moreover, of the 70 to\r\n75 per cent. of those who participate in the election, the majority,\r\naccording to our judgment, vote in a way that they would not, if they\r\nrealized their true interests. That as yet they have not realized them\r\ncomes from defective political training, a training, however, that these\r\n70 to 75 per cent. possess in a higher degree than the 25 to 30 per\r\ncent., who stay away altogether. Among the latter, those must be\r\nexcepted who remain away from the hustings because they cannot, without\r\ndanger, vote according to their convictions.\r\n\r\nPolitical education is not gained by keeping the masses from public\r\naffairs; it is gained by admitting them to the exercise of political\r\nrights. Practice makes perfect. The ruling classes have hitherto found\r\ntheir account in keeping the large majority of the people in political\r\nchildhood. Hence it has ever been the task of a class-conscious minority\r\nto battle with energy and enthusiasm for the collective interest of\r\nsociety, and to shake up and drag the large inert mass after them. Thus\r\nhas it been in all great Movements: it is neither astonishing nor\r\ndiscouraging that the experience made with the Movement of the working\r\nclass is repeated in the Movement for the emancipation of woman.\r\nPrevious successes prove that pains, labor and sacrifices are rewarded;\r\nthe future brings triumph.\r\n\r\nThe moment woman acquires equal rights with man, the sense of her duties\r\nwill be quickened. Called upon to cast her ballot, she will ask, What\r\nfor? Whom for? Immediately, emulation in many directions will set in\r\nbetween man and woman that, so far from injuring, will materially\r\nimprove their mutual relations. The less posted woman will naturally\r\nturn to the better posted man. Interchange of ideas and mutual\r\ninstruction follows,--a condition of things until now found most rarely\r\nbetween husband and wife: it will impart a fresh charm to life. The\r\nunhappy differences in education and view-points between the two\r\nsexes,--differences, that so frequently lead to dissensions between\r\nhusband and wife, that place the husband at variance with his many-sided\r\nduties, and that injure the well-being of all, will be wiped out.\r\nInstead of a clog, the husband will gain a supporter in a compatible\r\nwife; whenever prevented by other duties from personal participation,\r\nshe will spur her husband to fulfil his own. She will find it legitimate\r\nthat a fraction of his earnings be spent in a newspaper, for agitational\r\npurposes, because the paper serves to educate and entertain her also,\r\nand because she realizes the necessity of the sacrifice, a sacrifice\r\nthat helps to conquer that which she, her husband and her children\r\nlack,--an existence worthy of human beings.\r\n\r\nThus, the joining of hands by husband and wife for the common weal, so\r\nclosely connected with the weal of the individual, will exert a most\r\nennobling influence. The very reverse is called into life of that which\r\nis claimed by near-sighted people, or by the foes of a commonwealth\r\nbased upon the equality of all. Nor would it end there. The relation\r\nbetween the two sexes would be beautiful in the measure that the social\r\ninstitutions will liberate husband and wife from material cares and from\r\nexcessive work. Practice and education will, here as in all other cases,\r\ngive further aid. If I go not in the water, I shall never learn to swim;\r\nif I study no foreign language and do not practice it, I shall never\r\nlearn to speak it. Everyone finds that natural; and yet many fail to\r\nrealize that the same holds good in the affairs of government and\r\nsociety. Are our women unfitter than the far lower negroes, to whom full\r\npolitical equality was conceded in North America? And shall a highly\r\nintellectual woman be vested with lesser rights than the rudest, least\r\ncultured man,--an ignorant day-laborer of the backwoods of Pomerania, or\r\nan ultramontane canalman, for instance, and all because accident let\r\nthese come into the world as men? The son has greater rights than his\r\nmother, from whom, perchance, he derives his best qualities, the very\r\nqualities that alone make him what he is. Truly wonderful!\r\n\r\nMoreover, we in Germany would no longer be running the risk of being the\r\nfirst to take the leap in the dark and the unknown. The United States,\r\nEngland and other countries have opened the way. In the State of Wyoming\r\nin the United States, woman suffrage has been tested since 1869. On\r\nNovember 12, 1872, writing from Laramie City, Wyo., on the subject,\r\nJudge Kingman says in the Chicago \"Women's Journal\":\r\n\r\n\"Three years ago to-day women obtained the right of electing and of\r\nbeing elected to office in our Territory, in the same manner as the\r\nother electors. During this period they have voted and have been voted\r\nfor; they have exercised the functions of jurors and arbiters; they have\r\ntaken part in large numbers at our elections, and although I believe\r\nthat some among us oppose the admission of women from motives of\r\nprinciple, no one, I think, can refuse to recognize that their influence\r\non the elections has been an elevating one. It caused them to be\r\nconducted in a more peaceable and orderly manner, and at the same time\r\nenabled our courts of justice to discover and punish various kinds of\r\ncrime that had until then remained unpunished.\r\n\r\n\"For instance, when the Territory was first organized, there was\r\nscarcely a man who did not carry a revolver and make use of it in the\r\nslightest dispute. I cannot remember a single case in which a jury\r\ncomposed of men brought in a verdict of guilty against one of those who\r\nhad shot with a revolver, but when two or three women were among them,\r\nthey have invariably attended to the instructions of the Court.\"\r\n\r\nIn what esteem woman suffrage was held in Wyoming twenty-five years\r\nafter its introduction, may be gathered from the address issued on\r\nNovember 12, 1894, to the Parliaments of the world by the Legislature of\r\nthat State. It says:\r\n\r\n\"The possession and exercise of suffrage by the women in Wyoming for the\r\npast quarter of a century has wrought no harm and has done great good in\r\nmany ways; it has largely aided in banishing crime, pauperism, and vice\r\nfrom this State, and that without any violent or oppressive legislation;\r\nit has secured peaceful and orderly elections, good government, and a\r\nremarkable degree of civilization and public order; and we point with\r\npride to the facts that after nearly twenty-five years of Woman Suffrage\r\nnot one county in Wyoming has a poorhouse, that our jails are almost\r\nempty, and crime, except that committed by strangers in the State,\r\nalmost unknown; and as the result of experience we urge every civilized\r\ncommunity on earth to enfranchise its women without delay.\"[154]\r\n\r\nWhile giving fullest credit to the political activity of the women of\r\nWyoming, we cannot go to the extreme, reached by the enthusiastic\r\ndefenders of woman suffrage in the Legislature of that State, of\r\nascribing exclusively to the ballot in woman's hands the enviable\r\nconditions, which, according to the account of the address, Wyoming\r\nrejoices in. A number of social causes of other nature contribute\r\nthereto. Nevertheless, the fact is unquestionable that female suffrage\r\nhas been accompanied by the most beneficent results for that State, and\r\nwithout one disadvantage. That is the most brilliant justification of\r\nits introduction.\r\n\r\nThe example of Wyoming found followers. To-day there are a number of\r\ncountries in which woman enjoys political rights to greater or less\r\nextent. In the United States, women obtained several years ago the\r\nballot in Colorado, and in 1894 they elected a number of\r\nrepresentatives; likewise in Arizona, and still more recently in\r\nMinnesota. In New Zealand, they took a lively part in the parliamentary\r\nelections of 1893, livelier, in fact, than the men, although they were\r\nonly qualified to elect: only men were qualified to be elected. In\r\nMarch, 1894, the Prime Minister declared to a deputation of women that\r\nhe would advocate their qualification to be elected. In 1893, there were\r\ntwenty-two States in the North American Union where women were qualified\r\nboth to elect and be elected for the School Boards. In Kansas, Nebraska,\r\nColorado, Oregon, Arizona, Dakota, Idaho, Minnesota and Montana they are\r\nfully qualified electors for municipal officers, provided they are\r\nresident citizens. In Argonia, Kans., the wife of a physician was\r\nelected Mayor;[155] the same thing happened in Onehunga, New Zealand.\r\nSince more than ten years ago, women in Sweden have the suffrage for\r\ndepartmental and municipal elections, under the same restrictions as\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nIn England, the struggle, for woman's political rights has a regular\r\nhistory behind it. According to the old custom of the Middle Ages,\r\nwomen, seized of landed property, were also vested with the suffrage,\r\nand, as such also filled judicial functions. In the course of time they\r\nlost these rights. In the bill for Parliamentary Reform in 1832, the\r\nword \"person\" was used, a term that, according to English conceptions,\r\nincludes the members of both sexes, men and women. This notwithstanding,\r\nthe law was interpreted adversely to women and they were turned back\r\nwherever they made the effort to vote. In the electoral reform Act of\r\n1867, the word \"man\" was substituted for the word \"person.\" John Stuart\r\nMill moved the re-insertion of \"person\" in place of \"man,\" with the\r\nexpress purpose that women shall be vested with the suffrage under the\r\nsame conditions as men. The motion was defeated by 196 votes against 83.\r\nSixteen years later, 1883, the attempt was again made in the Lower House\r\nto grant women the suffrage. A motion to that effect was defeated by a\r\nmajority of 16. A further attempt in 1884 was defeated in a fuller House\r\nby more than 136 votes. But the minority did not evacuate the field. In\r\n1886 it succeeded in carrying to a second reading a motion to grant\r\nwomen the suffrage; but the dissolution of Parliament prevented a final\r\nvote being taken. Again, on April 27, 1892, the Lower House defeated\r\nwith 175 votes against 152, the second reading of a motion on the\r\nsubject presented by Sir A. Rollit, and which provided as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Every woman who in Great Britain is registered or entitled to be\r\nregistered as an elector for a Town Council or County Council or who in\r\nIreland is a rate payer entitled to vote in the election of Guardians of\r\nthe Poor, shall be entitled to be registered as a Parliamentary elector,\r\nand when registered, to vote at any Parliamentary election for the\r\ncounty, borough, or division wherein the qualifying property is\r\nsituate.\"\r\n\r\nOn November 29, 1888, Lord Salisbury held a speech in Edinburgh, in the\r\ncourse of which he said: \"I earnestly hope that the day is not far\r\ndistant when women also will bear their share in voting for members in\r\nthe political world and in the determining the policy of the country.\"\r\nAnd Alfred Russell Wallace, celebrated as a naturalist and follower of\r\nDarwin, expressed himself upon the same question this wise: \"When men\r\nand women shall have freedom to follow their best impulses, when both\r\nshall receive the best possible education, when no false restraints\r\nshall be imposed upon any human being by the reason of the accident of\r\nsex, and when public opinion shall be regulated by the wisest and best\r\nand shall be systematically impressed upon youth, then shall we find\r\nthat a system of human selection will arise that is bound to have a\r\nreformed humanity for its result. So long as woman is compelled to\r\nregard marriage as a means by which to escape poverty and avoid neglect,\r\nshe is and remains at a disadvantage with man. Hence, the first step in\r\nthe emancipation of woman is the removal of all restraints that prevent\r\nher from competing with man on all the fields of industry and in all\r\npursuits. But we must go further, and allow woman the exercise of her\r\n_political rights_. Many of the restraints, under which woman has\r\nsuffered until now, would have been spared to her, had she had direct\r\nrepresentation in Parliament.\"\r\n\r\nIn most sections of England, married women have the same political\r\nrights as men in the elections for the School Boards and Guardians of\r\nthe Poor, and in many places are themselves qualified for election. At\r\nthe county elections, _unmarried_ women have the right to vote under the\r\nsame restrictions as men, but are not themselves qualified for election.\r\nLikewise did all independent tax-paying women obtain the right to vote\r\nby the Reform Act of 1869, but are not qualified for election. _Married\r\nwomen_ are in virtue of a court decision, rendered in 1872, excluded\r\nfrom the suffrage, because _in English law woman loses her independence\r\nby marriage_--a decided encouragement for women to keep away from the\r\nlegal formality of legitimate marriage. Seeing that also in other\r\nrespects unmarried or divorced women in England and Scotland are clothed\r\nwith rights denied to married women, the temptation is not slight for\r\nwomen to renounce legitimate unions. It is not exactly the part of\r\nwisdom for the male representatives of bourgeois society to degrade\r\nbourgeois marriage into a sort of slave status for woman.[156]\r\n\r\nIn Austria, women who are landed proprietors, or conduct a business, to\r\nwhich the suffrage is attached, have the right to exercise the privilege\r\n_by attorney_. This holds both for local and Reichstag elections. If the\r\nwoman is proprietor of a mercantile or industrial establishment, which\r\ngives the right to vote for the Chamber of Commerce, her franchise must\r\nbe exercised by a business manager. In France, on the contrary, a woman\r\nwho conducts a business, has a right to vote at the election of members\r\nfor the tribunals of commerce, but she cannot herself be elected.\r\nAccording to the law of 1891 of the old Prussian provinces, women have\r\nthe suffrage, if the landed property that belongs to them conveys the\r\nright to vote, nevertheless they must exercise the privilege through a\r\nmale representative, neither are they eligible themselves. Likewise\r\naccording to the laws of Hanover, Brunswick, Schleswig-Holstein,\r\nSachsen-Weimar, Hamburg and Luebeck. In Saxony, the law allows women the\r\nsuffrage if they are landed proprietors and are _unmarried_. If married,\r\nthe woman's vote goes to her husband. In all these cases, accordingly,\r\nthe right of suffrage does not attach to persons but to property--quite\r\na light upon existing political and legal morality: Man, thou art zero\r\nif moneyless or propertyless; knowledge, intellect are secondary\r\nmatters. Property decides.\r\n\r\nWe see that the principle of denying woman the suffrage on the theory of\r\nher not being \"of age\" is broken through in fact; and yet objection is\r\nraised to granting her the right in full. It is said that to grant woman\r\nthe suffrage is dangerous because she yields easily to religious\r\nprejudices, and is conservative. She is both only because she is\r\nignorant. Let her be educated and taught where her interests lie. For\r\nthe rest, the influence of religion on elections is exaggerated.\r\nUltramontane agitation has hitherto been so successful in Germany only\r\nbecause it knew how to join _social with religious interests_. The\r\nultramontane chaplains long vied with the Socialists in uncovering the\r\nsocial foulness. Hence their influence with the masses. With the close\r\nof the Kulturkampf, the influence of the Catholic clergymen upon the\r\nmasses waned. The clergy is forced to discontinue its opposition to the\r\nGovernment; simultaneously therewith, the rising class struggle compels\r\nit to consider the Catholic capitalist class and Catholic nobility; it\r\nwill, accordingly, be compelled to observe greater caution on the social\r\nfield. Thus the clergy will forfeit its influence with the workingmen,\r\nespecially at such critical junctures when considerations for the\r\nGovernment and the ruling classes drive it to approve of, or tolerate\r\nactions and laws directed against the interests of the working class.\r\nThe same causes will, in the end, have their influence upon woman. When\r\nat public meetings, through newspapers and from personal observation she\r\nwill have learned where her own interest lies, woman will emancipate\r\nherself from the clergy, the same as man has done. The fiercest opponent\r\nof female suffrage is the clergy, and it knows the reason why. Its rule\r\nand its domains are endangered.\r\n\r\nThat the movement for the political rights of woman has not been\r\npromptly crowned with greater success is no reason to withhold the\r\nballot from her. What would the workingmen say if the Liberals proposed\r\nabolishing manhood suffrage--and the same is very inconvenient to\r\nthem--on the ground that it benefits the Socialists in particular? A\r\ngood law does not become bad by reason of him who wields it not yet\r\nhaving learned its right use.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the right to be elected should go together with the right to\r\nelect. \"A woman in the tribune of the Reichstag, that would be a\r\nspectacle!\" we hear people exclaim. Our generation has grown accustomed\r\nto the sight of women in the speaker's tribune at their conventions and\r\nmeetings; in the United States, also in the pulpit and the jury box--why\r\nnot, then, also in the tribune of the Reichstag? The first woman elected\r\nto the Reichstag, would surely know how to impose respect. When the\r\nfirst workingmen entered the Reichstag it was also believed they could\r\nbe laughed down, and it was claimed that the working class would soon\r\nrealize the foolishness it had committed in electing such people. Its\r\nrepresentatives, however, knew how to make themselves quickly respected;\r\nthe fear to-day is lest there be too many of them. Frivolous witlings\r\nput in: \"Just imagine a pregnant woman in the tribune of the Reichstag;\r\nhow utterly unesthetic!\" The identical gentlemen find it, however, quite\r\nin order that pregnant women work at the most unesthetic trades, at\r\ntrades in which female dignity, health and decency are undermined. In\r\nthe eyes of a Socialist, that man is a wretch who can crack jokes over a\r\nwoman with child. The mere thought that his own mother once looked like\r\nthat before she brought him into the world, should cause his cheeks to\r\nburn with shame; the thought that he, rude jester, expects from a\r\nsimilar condition on the part of his wife the fulfillment of his dearest\r\nwishes should cause him, furthermore, to hold his tongue in shame.\r\n\r\n_A woman who gives birth to children renders, at least, the same service\r\nto the commonwealth as the man who defends his country and his hearth\r\nwith his life against a foe in search of conquests._ Moreover, the life\r\nof a woman trembles in the scales at child-birth. All our mothers have\r\nlooked death in the face at our births, and many succumbed. _The number\r\nof women who die as a result of child-birth, or who as a consequence\r\npine away in sickness, is greater than that of the men who fall on the\r\nfield of battle, or are wounded._ In Prussia, between 1816-1876, not\r\nless than 321,791 women fell a prey to child-birth fever--a yearly\r\naverage of 5,363. This is by far a larger figure than that of the\r\nPrussians, who, during the same period, were killed in war or died of\r\ntheir wounds. Nor must, at the contemplation of this enormous number of\r\nwomen who died of child-birth fever, the still larger number of those be\r\nlost sight of, who, as a consequence of child-birth, are permanently\r\ncrippled in health, and die prematurely.[157] These are additional\r\nreasons for woman's equal rights with man--reasons to be held up\r\nespecially to those, who play man's duty to defend the Fatherland as a\r\ndecisive circumstance, entitling them to superior consideration to\r\nwomen. For the rest, in virtue of our military institutions, most men do\r\nnot even fill this duty: to the majority of them it exists upon paper\r\nonly.\r\n\r\nAll these superficial objections to the public activity of woman would\r\nbe unimaginable were the relations of the two sexes a natural one, and\r\nwere there not an antagonism, artificially raised side by side with the\r\nrelation of master and servant between the two. From early youth the two\r\nare separated in social intercourse and education. Above all, it is the\r\nantagonism, for which Christianity is responsible, that keeps the sexes\r\nsteadily apart and the one in ignorance about the other, and that\r\nhinders free social intercourse, mutual confidence, a mutual\r\nsupplementing of traits of character.\r\n\r\nOne of the first and most important tasks of a rationally organized\r\nsociety must be to end this unhallowed split, and to reinstate Nature in\r\nits rights. The violence done to Nature starts at school: First, the\r\nseparation of the sexes; next, mistaken, or no instruction whatever, in\r\nmatters that concern the human being as a sexual entity. True enough,\r\nnatural history is taught in every tolerably good school. The child\r\nlearns that birds lay eggs and hatch them out: he also learns when the\r\nmating season begins: that males and females are needed: that both\r\njointly assume the building of the nests, the hatching and the care of\r\nthe young. He also learns that mammals bring forth live young: he learns\r\nabout the rutting season and about the fights of the males for the\r\nfemales during the same: he learns the usual number of young, perhaps\r\nalso the period of pregnancy. But on the subject of the origin and\r\ndevelopment of his own stock he remains in the dark; that is veiled in\r\nmystery. When, thereupon, the child seeks to satisfy his natural\r\ncuriosity with questions addressed to his parents, to his mother in\r\nparticular--he seldom ventures with them to his teacher--he is saddled\r\nwith the silliest stories that cannot satisfy him, and that are all the\r\nmore injurious when he some day does ascertain the truth. There are\r\nprobably few children who have not made the discovery by the twelfth\r\nyear of their age. In all small towns, in the country especially,\r\nchildren observe from earliest years the mating of birds, the copulation\r\nof domestic animals; they see this in closest proximity, in the yard, on\r\nthe street, and when the cattle are turned loose. They see that the\r\nconditions under which the heat of the cattle is gratified, as well as\r\nthe act of birth of the several domestic animals are made the subject of\r\nserious, thorough and undisguised discussion on the part of their\r\nparents, elder brothers and servants. All that awakens doubts in the\r\nchild's mind on the accounts given him of his own entry into life.\r\nFinally the day of knowledge does come; but it comes in a way other than\r\nit would have come under a natural and rational education. The secret\r\nthat the child discovers leads to estrangement between child and\r\nparents, particularly between child and mother. The reverse is obtained\r\nof that which was aimed at in folly and shortsightedness. He who\r\nrecalls his own youth and that of his young companions knows what the\r\nresults frequently are.\r\n\r\nAn American woman says, among other things in a work written by her,\r\nthat wishing to answer the repeated questions of her eight-year-old son\r\non his origin, and unwilling to saddle him with nursery tales, she\r\ndisclosed the truth to him. The child listened to her with great\r\nattention, and, from the day that he learned what cares and pains he had\r\ncaused his mother, he clung to her with a tenderness and reverence not\r\nnoticed in him before, and showed the same reverence toward other women\r\nalso.[158] The authoress proceeds from the correct premises that only by\r\nmeans of a natural education can any real improvement--more respect and\r\nself-control on the part of the male toward the female sex--be expected.\r\nHe who reasons free from prejudice will arrive at no other conclusion.\r\n\r\nWhatever be the point of departure in the _critique_ of our social\r\nconditions, the conclusion is ever the same--their _radical\r\ntransformation_; thereby a radical transformation in the position of the\r\nsexes is inevitable. Woman, in order to arrive all the quicker at the\r\ngoal, must look for allies whom, in the very nature of things, the\r\nmovement of the working class steers in her direction. Since long has\r\nthe class-conscious proletariat begun the storming of the fortress, the\r\nClass-State, which also upholds the present domination of one sex by the\r\nother. That fortress must be surrounded on all sides with trenches, and\r\nassailed to the point of surrender with artillery of all calibre. The\r\nbesieging army finds its officers and munitions on all sides. Social and\r\nnatural science, jointly with historical research, pedagogy, hygiene and\r\nstatistics are advancing from all directions, and furnish ammunition and\r\nweapons to the movement. Nor does philosophy lag behind. In\r\nMainlaender's \"The Philosophy of Redemption,\"[159] it announces the\r\nnear-at-hand realization of the \"Ideal State.\"\r\n\r\nThe ultimate conquest of the Class-State and its transformation is\r\nrendered all the easier to us through the divisions in the ranks of its\r\ndefenders, who, despite the oneness of their interests against the\r\ncommon enemy, are perpetually at war with one another in the strife for\r\nplunder. Further aid comes to us from the daily-growing mutiny in the\r\nranks of the enemies, whose forces to a great extent are bone of our\r\nbone, and flesh of our flesh--elements that, out of misunderstanding and\r\nmisled, have hitherto fought against us and thus against themselves, but\r\nare gradually becoming clearsighted, and pass over to us. Finally we are\r\naided by the desertion of the honorable elements from the ranks of the\r\nhitherto hostile men of thought, who have perceived the truth, and whose\r\nhigher knowledge spurs them to leap their low class interests, and,\r\nfollowing their ideal aspirations after justice, join the masses that\r\nare thirsting for freedom.\r\n\r\nMany do not yet realize the stage of dissolution that State and Society\r\nare in. Hence, and although the dark blotches have been frequently\r\npointed out in the preceding chapters, a separate treatment of the\r\nsubject is requisite.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[151] Louis Bridel, \"La Puissance Maritale,\" Lausanne, 1879.\r\n\r\n[152] In the presentation of these civil rights we have merely followed\r\nLouis Bridel's work: \"Le Droit des Femmes et le Marriage,\" Paris, 1893.\r\n\r\n[153] How correct this view is transpires also from the comedy of\r\nAristophanes: \"The Popular Assembly of Women.\" In that comedy,\r\nAristophanes depicts how the Athenian government had reached the point\r\nwhen everything was going at sixes and sevens. The Prytaneum put the\r\nquestion to the popular assembly of the Athenian citizens: \"How is the\r\nState to be saved?\" Thereupon a woman, disguised as a man, made the\r\nproposition to entrust the helm of State to the women, and the\r\nproposition was accepted without opposition \"because it was the only\r\nthing that had never before happened in Athens.\" The women seized the\r\nhelm, and forthwith instituted _communism_. Of course, Aristophanes\r\nturns this condition into ridicule, but the significant point in the\r\nplay is that, the moment the women had a decisive word in public\r\naffairs, they instituted communism as the only rational political and\r\nsocial condition from the standpoint of their own sex. Aristophanes\r\nlittle dreamed how he hit the truth while meaning to joke.\r\n\r\n[154] The above two paragraphs are left as they appear in the text,\r\nalthough they seem to be subject to corrections.\r\n\r\nA diligent search in the libraries of this city for the original of the\r\nabove \"Address to the Parliaments of the World,\" stated to have been\r\nissued by the Legislature of Wyoming in 1894, having proved vain, the\r\nSecretary of the State of Wyoming was written to. His answer was:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State of Wyoming,\r\nOffice of the Secretary of State.\r\nCheyenne, June 5, 1903.\r\n\r\nMr. Daniel DeLeon, New York City:\r\n\r\nDear Sir--Replying to your letter of June 1st, would say that the\r\nLegislature of Wyoming was not in session in 1894, and did not pass any\r\nresolutions on Woman Suffrage in 1893 or 1895.\r\n\r\nI enclose herewith the resolutions adopted by the Legislature of 1901,\r\nand also Senate and House resolutions adopted in 1903 on the subject of\r\nWoman Suffrage. Yours truly,\r\n\r\nF. Chatterton,\r\nSecretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe resolutions enclosed in the above letter were these:\r\n\r\n[House Joint Resolution No. 8, adopted February, 1901.]\r\n\r\nWhereas, Wyoming was the first state to adopt equal suffrage and equal\r\nsuffrage has been in operation since 1869; was adopted in the\r\nconstitution of the State of Wyoming in 1890, during which time women\r\nhave exercised the privilege as generally as men, with the result that\r\nbetter candidates have been selected for office, methods of election\r\nhave been purified, the character of legislation improved, civic\r\nintelligence increased and womanhood developed to greater usefulness by\r\npolitical responsibility;\r\n\r\nTherefore, Resolved, by the House of Representatives, the Senate\r\nconcurring, That, in view of these results, the enfranchisement of women\r\nin every state and territory of the American Union is hereby recommended\r\nas a measure tending to the advancement of a higher and better social\r\norder.\r\n\r\nThat an authenticated copy of these resolutions be forwarded by the\r\nGovernor of the state to the legislature of every state and territory,\r\nand that the press be requested to call public attention to these\r\nresolutions.\r\n\r\n                          Edward W.

Our social relations have thereby been thrown\r\ninto a state of unrest, fermentation and dissolution never known before.\r\nThe ruling classes no longer feel the ground safe under them, nor do\r\nexisting institutions any longer possess the firmness requisite to\r\nbreast the storm, that is approaching from all sides. A feeling of\r\nuneasiness, of insecurity and of dissatisfaction has seized upon all\r\ncircles, high and low. The paroxysmal efforts put forth by the ruling\r\nclasses to end this unbearable state of things by means of tinkering at\r\nthe body social prove themselves vain and inadequate. The general sense\r\nof increasing insecurity, that comes from these failures, increases\r\ntheir uneasiness and discomfort. Hardly have they inserted a beam in the\r\nshape of some law into the rickety structure, than they discover ten\r\nother places where shoring is still more urgent. All along they are at\r\nperpetual strife among themselves and deeply rent by differences of\r\nopinion. What one set deems necessary, in order somewhat to calm and\r\nreconcile the increasingly discontented masses, the other considers as\r\ngoing too far, and unpardonable weakness and pliancy, only calculated to\r\nprick the longing after greater concessions. Striking evidences thereof\r\nare the debates in the 1894-5 sessions of the Reichstag, both on the\r\nfloor of the house and in committee, on the so-called \"revolutionary\r\nbill,\" as well as numerous other discussions in all parliaments. Within\r\nthe ruling classes themselves there exist unbridgeable contrasts, and\r\nthey sharpen the social conflicts.\r\n\r\nGovernments--and not in Germany alone--are shaking like reeds in the\r\nwind. They must lean on something: without support they cannot exist:\r\nthey now lean on this side, then on that. In no progressive country of\r\nEurope is there a Government with a lasting parliamentary majority, on\r\nwhich it can count with safety. Majorities are breaking up and\r\ndissolving; and the ever changing course, in Germany, especially,\r\nundermines the last vestige of confidence that the ruling class had in\r\nthemselves. To-day one set is anvil, the other the hammer; to-morrow it\r\nis the other way. The one tears down what the other painfully builds up.\r\nThe confusion is ever greater; the discontent ever more lasting; the\r\ncauses of friction multiply and consume in a few months more energies\r\nthan years did formerly. Along with all that, material sacrifices,\r\ncalled for by manifold taxes, swell beyond all measure.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all this, our sapient statesmen are lulling themselves\r\nin wondrous illusions. With an eye to sparing property and the rich,\r\nforms of taxation are selected that smite the needy classes heaviest,\r\nand they are decreed with the belief that, seeing a large portion of the\r\nmasses have not yet discovered their real nature, neither will they be\r\nfelt. This is an error. The masses to-day understand fully the nature of\r\nindirect imports and taxes upon the necessaries of life. Their growing\r\npolitical education and perspicuity disclose to them the gross injustice\r\nof the same; and they are all the more sensitive to these burdens by\r\nreason of the wretchedness of their economic conditions, especially\r\nwhere families are large. The rise of prices in the necessaries of\r\nlife--due to indirect imposts, or to causes that bring on similar\r\nresults, such as the premiums on brandy and sugar that, to the amount of\r\ndozens of millions, a part of the ruling class pockets yearly at the\r\nexpense of the poor of the kingdom, and that it seeks to raise still\r\nhigher--are realized to be a gross injustice, a heavy burden, measures\r\nthat stand in odd contradiction with the nature of the so-called\r\nChristian State, the State of Social Reform. These measures extinguish\r\nthe last spark of faith in the sense of justice of the ruling classes,\r\nto a degree that is serious to these. It changes nothing in the final\r\neffect of these measures that the draining is done in pennies. The\r\nincrease in the expenditure is there, and is finally sensible to the\r\nfeeling and the sight of all. Hundreds upon hundreds of millions cannot\r\nbe squeezed out of practically empty pockets, without the owners of the\r\npockets becoming aware of the lifting. The strong pressure of direct\r\ntaxation, directs the dissatisfaction among the poor against the State;\r\nthe still stronger indirect taxation, _directs the discontent against\r\nsociety also, the evil being felt to be of a social as well as political\r\ncharacter_. In that there is progress. Him whom the gods would destroy,\r\nthey first make blind.\r\n\r\nIn the endeavor to do justice to the most opposed interests, laws are\r\nheaped upon laws; but no old one is thoroughly repealed, nor new one\r\nthoroughly enforced. Everything is done by halves, giving satisfaction\r\nin no direction. The requirements of civilization that spring from the\r\nlife of the people, demand some attention, unless everything is to be\r\nrisked; even the fractional way they are attended to, demands\r\nconsiderable sacrifice, all the more seeing that our public institutions\r\nare overrun by parasites. At the same time, not only are all the\r\nunproductive institutions, wholly at variance with the trend of\r\ncivilization, continued in force, but, due to the existing conflicts of\r\ninterests, they are rather enlarged, and thus they become all the more\r\nburdensome and oppressive in the measure that increasing popular\r\nintelligence ever more loudly pronounces them superfluous. Police,\r\narmies, courts of law, prisons, the whole administrative apparatus--all\r\nare enlarged ever more, and become ever more expensive. And yet neither\r\nexternal nor internal security is obtained. The reverse follows.\r\n\r\nA wholly unnatural state of things has gradually arisen in the\r\ninternational relations of the several nations. The relations between\r\nnation and nation multiply in the measure that the production of goods\r\nincreases; that, thanks to improved transportation, the exchange of this\r\nmass of merchandise is facilitated; and that the economic and scientific\r\nachievements of each become the public possession of all. Treaties of\r\ncommerce are concluded; expensive routes of traffic--Suez Canals, St.\r\nGotthard Tunnels--are opened with international funds. Individual\r\ncountries support with heavy subsidies steamship lines that help to\r\npromote intercourse between several nations. The Postal Union--a step of\r\nfirst rank in civilization--is established; international conventions\r\nare convoked for all imaginable practical and scientific purposes; the\r\nliterary products of genius of any nation are spread abroad by\r\ntranslations into the leading languages. Thus the tendency is ever more\r\nstrongly marked toward the internationalizing, the fraternizing of all\r\npeoples. Nevertheless, the political, the military state of the nations\r\nof Europe stands in strange contrast to this general development. The\r\nhatred of nation against nation, Chauvinism, is artificially nourished\r\nby all. The ruling classes seek everywhere to keep green the belief that\r\nit is the peoples who are hostilely inclined toward one another, and\r\nonly wait for the moment when one of them may fall upon another and\r\ndestroy it. The competitive struggle between the capitalists of several\r\ncountries, together with their jealousy of one another, assume upon the\r\ninternational field the character of a struggle between the capitalists\r\nof one country against those of another, and, backed by the political\r\nblindness of the large masses, it conjures into existence a contest of\r\nmilitary armaments such as the world has never seen before. This contest\r\nhas brought forth armies of magnitudes that never were known; it\r\nproduced implements of murder and destruction for land and naval warfare\r\nof such perfection as is possible only in an age of such advanced\r\ntechnique as ours. The contest drives these antagonisms to a head, it\r\nincites a development of means of destruction that finally destroy\r\nthemselves. The support of the armies and navies demand sacrifices that\r\nyearly become larger, and that finally ruin the richest nation. Germany,\r\nfor instance, had, according to the imperial budget of 1894-95, a\r\nregular army and navy outlay of nearly 700 million marks--inclusive of\r\npensions and of interest on the national debt, which amounts in round\r\nfigures to two milliards, incurred mainly for purposes of war. Under\r\nthese war expenses, the appropriations for educational and other\r\npurposes of culture suffer severely; the most pressing needs in this\r\ndirection are neglected; and that side of the State, devoted to\r\nso-called external defence, acquires a preponderance that undermines the\r\noriginal purpose of the State itself. The increasing armies absorb the\r\nhealthiest and most vigorous portion of the nation; for their\r\nimprovement all mental and physical forces are enlisted in a way as if\r\neducation in mass-murder were the highest mission of our times.\r\nFurthermore, implements of war as of murder are continuously improved:\r\nthey have attained--in point of swiftness, range and power--a perfection\r\nthat renders them fearful to friend and foe. If some day this tremendous\r\napparatus is set in operation--when the hostile forces of Europe will\r\ntake the field with twelve or fourteen million men--the fact will appear\r\nthat it has become uncontrollable. There is no general who could command\r\nsuch masses; there is no field vast enough to collect and set them up;\r\nno administrative apparatus that could nourish them for any length of\r\ntime. If battles are delivered, hospitals would be lacking to shelter\r\nthe wounded: the interment of the numerous dead would be an\r\nimpossibility.\r\n\r\nWhen to all this is added the frightful disturbances and devastations,\r\nproduced to-day by a European _war on the economic-field_, there is no\r\nexaggeration in the saying: \"_the next war is the last war_.\" The number\r\nof bankruptcies will be unparalleled; export stops--and thereby\r\nthousands of factories are condemned to idleness; the supply of food\r\nceases--and thereby the prices of the means of life rise enormously. The\r\nnumber of families whose breadwinner is in the field runs up into the\r\nmillions, and most of them must be supported. Whence shall the means\r\ncome for all that?\r\n\r\nThe political and military state of Europe has taken a development that\r\ncannot choose but end in a catastrophe, which will drag capitalist\r\nsociety down to its ruin. Having reached the height of its development,\r\nit produces conditions that end with rendering its own existence\r\nimpossible; it digs its own grave; it slays itself with the identical\r\nmeans that itself, as the most revolutionary of all previous social\r\nsystems, has called into life.\r\n\r\nGradually a large portion of our municipalities are arriving at a\r\ndesperate pass: they hardly know how to meet the increasing demands upon\r\nthemselves. It is more particularly upon our rapidly growing large\r\ncities, and upon the localities situated in industrial districts, that\r\nthe quickened increase of population makes a mass of demands, which the\r\ngenerally poor communities can come up to only by raising taxes and\r\nincurring debts. The budgets leap upward from year to year for school\r\nbuildings, and street paving, for lighting, draining and water works;\r\nfor sanitary, public and educational purposes; for the police and the\r\nadministration. At the same time, the favorably situated minority makes\r\nthe most expensive demands upon the community. It demands higher\r\ninstitutions of education, theatres, the opening of particularly fine\r\ncity quarters with lighting, pavement, etc., to match. However justly\r\nthe majority may complain of the preference, it lies in the very nature\r\nof modern affairs. The minority has the power and uses it to satisfy its\r\nsocial wants as much as possible at the expense of the collectivity. In\r\nand of themselves nothing can be said against these heightened social\r\nwants: they denote progress; the fault is only that their satisfaction\r\nfalls mainly to the lot of the property classes, while all others should\r\nshare them. A further evil lies in that often the administration is not\r\nthe best, and yet is expensive. The officials often are inadequate; they\r\nare not sufficiently equipped for the many-sided demands made upon them,\r\ndemands that often presuppose thorough knowledge. The members of\r\nAldermanic Boards have generally so much to do and to attend to in their\r\nown private affairs that they are unable to make the sacrifices demanded\r\nfor the full exercise of these public duties. Often are these posts used\r\nfor the promotion of private interests, to the serious injury of those\r\nof the community. The results fall upon the taxpayers. Modern society\r\ncannot think of undertaking a thorough change in these conditions. It is\r\npowerless and helpless. It would have to remove itself, and that, of\r\ncourse, it will not. Whatever the manner in which taxes be imposed,\r\ndissatisfaction increases steadily. In a few decades, most of our\r\nmunicipalities will be unable to satisfy their needs under their present\r\nform of administration and of raising revenues. On the municipal as well\r\nas on the national field, the need of a radical change is manifest: it\r\nis upon the municipalities that the largest social demands are made: it\r\nis society _in nuce_: it is the kernel from which, so soon as the will\r\nand the power shall be there, the social change will radiate. How can\r\njustice be done to-day, when private interests dominate and the\r\ninterests of the commonweal are made subservient?\r\n\r\nSuch, in short, is the state of things in the nation and in the\r\nmunicipality. They are both but the reflection of the economic life of\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe struggle for existence in our economic life grows daily more\r\ngigantic. The war of all against all has broken out with virulence; it\r\nis conducted pitilessly, often regardless of the weapon used. The\r\nwell-known French expression: \"_ote-toi de la, que je m'y mette_.\" (Get\r\naway, that I may step in) is carried out in practice with vigorous\r\nelbowings, cuffings, and pinchings. The weaker must yield to the\r\nstronger. Where physical strength--which here is the power of money, of\r\nproperty--does not suffice, the most cunning and unworthy means are\r\nresorted to. Lying, swindle, deceit, forgery, perjury--the very blackest\r\ncrimes are often committed in order to reach the coveted object. As in\r\nthis struggle for existence one individual transgresses against the\r\nother, the same happens with class against class, sex against sex, age\r\nagainst age. Profit is the sole regulator of human feelings; all other\r\nconsiderations must yield. Thousands upon thousands of workingmen and\r\nworking-women are, the moment profit demands it, thrown upon the\r\nsidewalk, and, after their last savings have been spent, turned to\r\npublic charity or forced to emigrate. Workingmen travel, so to speak, in\r\nherds from place to place, criss-cross across the country, and are\r\nregarded by \"decent\" society with all the more fear and horror, seeing\r\nthat the continuity of their enforced idleness deteriorates their\r\nexternal appearance, and, as a consequence, demoralizes them internally.\r\nDecent society has no inkling of what it means to be forced, for months\r\nat a stretch, to be denied the simplest exigencies of order and\r\ncleanliness, to wander from place to place with a hungry stomach, and to\r\nearn, generally, nothing but ill-concealed fear and contempt, especially\r\nfrom those quarters that are the very props of this system. The families\r\nof these wretches suffer all along utmost distress--a distress that not\r\ninfrequently drives the parents, out of desperation, to frightful crimes\r\nupon their own children and themselves. The last years have furnished\r\nnumerous shocking instances of whole families falling a prey to murder\r\nand suicide. Let one instance do for many. The private correspondent,\r\nS----, in Berlin, 45 years of age, with a still handsome wife 39 years\r\nold, and a daughter of 12, is without work and starving. The wife\r\ndecides, with the consent of her husband, to turn prostitute. The police\r\ngets wind thereof. The wife is placed under moral control. The family,\r\novercome with shame and desperate, agree, all three, to poison\r\nthemselves, and carry out their resolve on March 1, 1883.[160] A few\r\ndays before, the leading circles of Berlin celebrated great court\r\nfestivities at which hundreds of thousands were squandered.\r\n\r\nSuch are the shocking contrasts of modern society--and yet we live in\r\n\"the best of all possible worlds.\" Berlin has since then often witnessed\r\nthe holocaust of whole families due to material want. In 1894 the\r\nspectacle was frequent, to an extent that called forth general horror;\r\nnor are the instances few, reported from large and small towns within\r\nand without Germany. This murder and suicide of whole families is a\r\nphenomenon peculiar to modern times, and an eloquent sign of the sorry\r\neconomic state that society is in.\r\n\r\nThis general want also drives women and girls in increasing numbers into\r\nthe arms of prostitution. Demoralization and crime are heaped up, and\r\nassume the most manifold forms. The only thing that prospers is the\r\njails, penitentiaries and so-called houses of correction, no longer able\r\nto accommodate the mass that is sent to them. The crimes of all sorts\r\nand their increase are intimately connected with the economic state of\r\nsociety--a fact, however, that the latter will not have. Like the\r\nostrich, it sticks its head in the sand, to avoid having to admit the\r\nincriminating state of things, and it lies to the point of deceiving\r\nitself into the belief that the fault lies with the laziness of the\r\nworkingmen, with their love of pleasure, and with their irreligiousness.\r\nThis is a self-deception of the most dangerous, or a hypocrisy of the\r\nmost repulsive, sort. The more unfavorable the state of society is for\r\nthe majority, all the more numerous and serious are the crimes\r\ncommitted. The struggle for existence assumes its rudest and most\r\nviolent aspect: it transfers man into conditions where each sees a\r\nmortal enemy in the other. The social bonds become looser every\r\nday.[161]\r\n\r\nThe ruling classes, who do not probe matters to the bottom, or do not\r\nlike to, seek to meet the evil after their own fashion. If poverty and\r\nwant, and, as a result therefrom, demoralization and crime increase, the\r\nsource of the evil is not searched after, so that it may be stopped; no;\r\nthe products of the conditions are punished. The more gigantic the evils\r\ngrow, and the numbers of evil-doers multiply in proportion,\r\nproportionately severe penalties and persecutions are deemed necessary.\r\nIt is sought to drive out the devil with Beelzebub. Prof. Haeckel also\r\nconsiders it proper to proceed against criminals with the severest\r\npunishments possible, and that capital punishment, in particular, be\r\nstringently applied.[162] By this stand the Professor places himself in\r\nsweet accord with the re-actionists of all shades, who otherwise are\r\nmortally opposed to him. Haeckel is of the opinion that incorrigible\r\nscape-graces must be uprooted like weeds that take from plants light,\r\nair and space. Had Haeckel turned his mind slightly toward social,\r\ninstead of engaging it wholly with natural science, he would know that\r\nthese criminals could, in most instances, be transformed into useful\r\nmembers of human society, provided society offered them the requisite\r\nconditions of existence. He would also find that the annihilation of\r\nindividual criminals or the rendering of them harmless, prevents as\r\nlittle the commission of fresh crimes in society, as the removal of\r\nweeds on a field would prevent their returning if the roots and seeds\r\nare not likewise destroyed. Absolutely to prevent the forming of harmful\r\norganisms in Nature is a feat man never will be able to achieve but _to\r\nso improve his own social system, a system produced by himself, that it\r\nmay afford favorable conditions of life for all, and furnish to each\r\nequal freedom to unfold, to the end that they no longer need suffer\r\nhunger, or be driven to satisfy their desire for property, or their\r\nambition at the expense of others--that is possible_. Let the cause of\r\nthe crimes be studied, and let that be removed; then will the crimes\r\nthemselves be wiped out.[163]\r\n\r\nThose who would remove crimes by removing the causes thereof, cannot, as\r\na matter of course, sympathize with a plan of brutal suppression. They\r\ncannot prevent society from protecting itself after its own fashion\r\nagainst the criminals, whom it cannot allow a free hand; but we demand\r\nall the more urgently the radical reformation of society, i. e., the\r\nremoval of the causes of crime.\r\n\r\nThe connection between social conditions, on the one hand, and evildoing\r\nand crimes, on the other, has been frequently established by\r\nstatisticians and sociologists. One of the misdemeanors nearest at\r\nhand--one that, all Christian charitable tenets to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding, modern society regards as a misdemeanor--is begging,\r\nespecially during hard times. On that subject, the statistics of the\r\nKingdom of Saxony inform us that, in the measure in which the last\r\nindustrial crisis increased--a crisis that began in Germany in 1890, and\r\nwhose end is not yet in sight--the number of persons also increased who\r\nwere punished for begging. In 1889, there were 8,566 persons punished\r\nfor this crime in the Kingdom of Saxony; in 1890, there were 8,815; in\r\n1891, there were 10,075; and in 1892 the figures rose to 13,120--quite\r\nan increase. Mass-impoverishment on one side, swelling affluence on the\r\nother--such is the sign-manual of our age. In Austria, in 1873, there\r\nwas one pauper to every 724 persons; in 1882, to every 622 persons.\r\nCrimes and misdemeanors show similar tendency. In Austria-Hungary, in\r\n1874, there were 308,605 persons sentenced in the criminal courts; in\r\n1892, their number was 600,000. In the German Empire, in 1882, there\r\nwere 329,968 persons sentenced for crimes and misdemeanors under the\r\nlaws of the land; that is to say, to every 10,000 inhabitants of twelve\r\nyears and over there were 103.2 criminals; in 1892, the number of\r\ncriminals was 422,327, or 143.3--an increase of 39 per cent. Among the\r\npersons punished, there were, for crimes and misdemeanors against\r\nproperty:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                          To Every 10,000\r\n                          Inhabitants,\r\n                          12 Years of Age\r\n      Year.      Total.    and Over.\r\n    1882        169,334      53.0\r\n    1891        196,437      55.8\r\n\r\n\r\nWe think these figures speak volumes. They show how the deterioration of\r\nsocial conditions intensify and promote poverty, want, misdemeanors and\r\ncrimes.\r\n\r\nThe basis of our social state is the capitalist system of production. On\r\nit modern society rests. All social, all political institutions are\r\nresults and fruits of that system. It is the ground from which the whole\r\nsocial and political superstructure, together with its bright and dark\r\nsides, have sprung up. It influences and dominates the thoughts and\r\nfeelings and actions of the people who live under it. Capital is the\r\nleading power in the State and in Society: the capitalist is the ruler\r\nof the propertyless, whose labor-power he buys for his use, and at a\r\nprice, that, like all other merchandise, is governed by supply and\r\ndemand and oscillates now above, then below the cost of reproduction.\r\nBut the capitalist does not buy labor-power out of \"sweet charity,\" in\r\norder to do a favor to the workingmen, although he often so pretends. He\r\nbuys it for the purpose of obtaining surplus wealth from the labor of\r\nthe workingmen, which he then pockets under the name of profit,\r\ninterest, house and ground rent. This surplus wealth, squeezed out of\r\nthe workingmen, and which in so far as the capitalist does not squander\r\nit in dissipation, crystallizes in his hands into more capital, puts him\r\nin a condition to steadily enlarge his plant, improve the process of\r\nproduction, and occupy increased labor forces. That, at the same time,\r\nenables him to step up before his weaker competitors, like a mailed\r\nknight before an unarmed pedestrian, and to destroy them. This unequal\r\nstruggle between large and small capital spreads amain, and, as the\r\ncheapest labor-power, next to that of children and lads, woman plays\r\ntherein a _role_ of increasing importance. The result is the ever\r\nsharper division of a smaller minority of mighty capitalists and a mass\r\nof capital-less male and female lack-alls whose only resource is the\r\ndaily sale of their labor-power. The middle class arrives hereby at a\r\nplight that grows ever graver. One field of industry after another,\r\nwhere small production still predominated, is seized and occupied to\r\ncapitalist ends. The competition of capitalists among themselves compels\r\nthem to explore ever newer fields of exploitation. Capital goes about\r\n\"like a roaring lion, seeking whom it may devour.\" The smaller and\r\nweaker establishments are destroyed; if their owners fail to save\r\nthemselves upon some new field--a feat that becomes ever harder and less\r\npossible--then they sink down into the class of the wage earners, or of\r\nCatilinarians. All efforts to prevent the downfall of handicraft and of\r\nthe middle class by means of institutions and laws, borrowed from the\r\nlumber-room of the musty past, prove utterly ineffective. They may\r\nenable one or another to deceive himself on his actual condition; but\r\nsoon the illusion vanishes under the heavy weight of facts. The process\r\nof absorption of the small by the large takes its course with all the\r\npower and pitilessness of a law of Nature, and the process is sensible\r\nto the feeling and the sight of all.\r\n\r\nIn the period between 1875-1882, the number of small industries\r\ndecreased in Prussia by 39,655,[164] although the population increased\r\nin this period by about two million heads. The number of workmen\r\nemployed in small industries sank, during that time, from 57.6 per\r\ncent., to 54.9 per cent. The industrial statistics for 1895 will furnish\r\nmuch more drastic figures. The development of large production stands in\r\nclose relation to the development of steam machine and steam\r\nhorse-power. And what is the picture presented by these? Prussia had:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                               1878.   1893.\r\n    Stationary steam boilers  32,411  53,024 +  63.6 per cent.\r\n    Stationary steam engines  29,895  53,092 +  77.6 per cent.\r\n    Movable machines           5,536  15,725 + 184   per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Kingdom of Saxony had:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                               1861.    1891.\r\n    Stationary steam engines   1,003    8,075 + 700 per cent.\r\n    Horse-power               15,633  160,772 + 922 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1861, a steam engine in Saxony had, on an average, a 15.5\r\nhorse-power; in 1891, it had 19. All Germany had in 1878 about three\r\nmillion horse-power in operation in industry; in 1894, about five\r\nmillion. Austria had in 1873 in round figures 336,000 horse-power; in\r\n1888, about 2,150,000. Steam power spreads daily, and stronger steam\r\nmachines drive out weaker ones--large production drives out small. The\r\nfact is shown emphatically in the industries in which steam has become\r\nthe general power, the brewery industry, for instance. In the German\r\nbrewery tax department, exclusive of Bavaria, Wuertemburg, Baden and\r\nAlsace-Lorraine, there were:--\r\n\r\n\r\n               Breweries       Industrially\r\n      Year.  in Operation.      Operated.          Output.\r\n    1873         13,561          10,927          19,654,900 hl.\r\n    1891-2        8,460           7,571          33,171,100 hl.\r\n                 ------          ------          ----------\r\n                  5,101           3,356          13,516,200 hl.\r\n                Decrease        Decrease          Increase\r\n             = 38 per cent.  = 31.1 per cent.  = 68.8 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe breweries in general, this table shows, had decreased during this\r\nperiod 38 per cent., the industrially operated ones 31.1 per cent.; the\r\noutput, however, had increased 68.8 per cent. The giant concerns\r\nincreased at the expense of the middle and small ones. The identical\r\ndevelopment is going on _in all countries of civilization, in all\r\nindustries capitalistically operated_. Let us now take up the brandy\r\ndistilleries. In all the eight provinces of Prussia, there were in\r\noperation:--[165]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Consumed in Distillery,\r\n      Year.  Distilleries.    Brandy (Double Quintal).\r\n    1831       13,806        1,736,458          5,418,217\r\n    1886-87     5,814        2,518,478         24,310,196\r\n               ------        ---------         ----------\r\n                7,992          782,020         18,891,979\r\n              Decrease        Decrease          Increase\r\n           = 38 per cent.  = 31.1 per cent.  = 68 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilar results are revealed in the coal and the mineral mining\r\nindustries of the German Empire. In the former, the number of leading\r\nconcerns--623 in number between the years 1871-1875--dropped to 406 in\r\n1889, but the output increased simultaneously from 34,485,400 tons to\r\n67,342,200 tons, and the average number of employees rose from 172,074\r\nto 239,954. In the latter, the average number of leading establishments\r\nbetween 1871-1875, was 3,034, with an average force of 277,878 hands,\r\nthat turned out 51,056,900 tons; in 1889, the number of leading\r\nestablishments had _dropped to 1,962, while the average force had risen\r\nto 368,896 hands, and the output to 99,414,100 tons_.[166] We see that\r\nin the coal mine industry the number of concerns decreased during that\r\nperiod 35 per cent., while the number of employees rose 40 per cent.,\r\nand production as much as 95.2 per cent. Similarly in the mineral mining\r\nindustry. Here the number of establishments decreased 35.3 per cent.,\r\nwhile the number of workingmen employed rose 33 per cent., and\r\nproduction 94.7 per cent. A smaller but much richer number of employers\r\nnow confronted a greatly swollen number of proletarians. Nor does this\r\ntechnical revolution proceed in industry alone: it is also going on in\r\nthe department of transportation and communication. German commerce had\r\nupon the seas:--\r\n\r\n\r\n              Sailing\r\n      Year.   Vessels.   Tonnage.   Crews.\r\n    1871       4,372     900,361    34,739\r\n    1893       2,742     725,182    17,522\r\n               -----     -------    ------\r\n               1,630     175,179    17,217\r\n             Decrease.  Decrease.  Decrease.\r\n\r\n\r\nSail navigation, we see, declines perceptibly, but in so far as it\r\ncontinues to exist, _the tonnage of vessels increases, and the force of\r\nthe crews decreases_. In 1871, there came to every one sailing vessel\r\n205.9 tons and 7.9 crew; in 1893, however, the average tonnage per\r\nsailing vessel was 271.7 and only a crew 6.4 strong. A different picture\r\nis offered by the German ocean steamship navigation. Germany had:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Year.        Steamers.  Tonnage.   Crews.\r\n    1871            147      81,994    4,736\r\n    1893            986     786,397   24,113\r\n                    ---     -------   ------\r\n        Increase    839     704,403   19,377\r\n\r\n\r\nWe see that, not only did the number of steamers rise considerably, but\r\nthat their tonnage increased still more; on the other hand, the force of\r\nthe crews had relatively decreased. In 1871, steamers had on an average\r\na 558 tonnage, with a 32.1 crew; in 1893 they had a 797.5 tonnage and\r\nonly a 24.5 crew. It is an economic law that the number of workingmen\r\n_decreases_ everywhere with the concentration of industry, while,\r\nrelatively to the whole population, wealth concentrates in ever fewer\r\nhands, and the number of employers, rendered unable to hold their own\r\nand driven into bankruptcy by the process of concentration, mounts ever\r\nhigher.\r\n\r\nIn the eight old provinces of Prussia, the population increased 42 per\r\ncent. during 1853-1890. But the incomes in the several grades rose in\r\nthe following rates:--[167]\r\n\r\n\r\n      Incomes.                 Increased\r\n    Up to     3,000 marks     42 per cent.\r\n    3,000--  36,000 marks    333 per cent.\r\n    36,000-- 60,000 marks    590 per cent.\r\n    60,000--120,000 marks    835 per cent.\r\n    Over    120,000 marks    942 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe number of incomes up to 3,000 marks increased exactly with the\r\npopulation; it would, however, have lagged behind it if, within the\r\nperiod of 1853-1890, there had not been an extraordinary increase of\r\nnational, State, municipal and private officials, the large majority of\r\nwhose incomes falls below 3,000 marks. On the other hand, the number of\r\nlarge incomes has risen beyond all proportion, although, during the\r\nperiod under consideration, there was not yet any provision in Prussia\r\nmaking the correct estimate of incomes obligatory. This was introduced\r\nin 1891. The actual increase of incomes was, accordingly, much larger\r\nthan the figures indicate. As stated before, the concentration of\r\nwealth, on the one side, is paralleled with mass-proletarianization, on\r\nthe other, and also with swelling figures of bankruptcy. During the\r\nperiod of 1880-1889, the number of bankruptcy cases, adjudicated by law,\r\naveraged, in Germany, 4,885 a year; it rose to 5,908 in 1890; to 7,234\r\nin 1891; and to 7,358 in 1892. These figures do not include the large\r\nnumber of bankruptcies that did not reach the courts, the assets not\r\nbeing large enough to cover the costs; neither are included among them\r\nthose that were settled out of court between the debtors and their\r\ncreditors.\r\n\r\nThe same picture that is presented by the economic development of\r\nGermany is presented by that of all industrial countries of the world.\r\nAll nations of civilization are endeavoring to become industrial States.\r\nThey wish to produce, not merely for the satisfaction of their own\r\ndomestic wants, but also for exportation. Hence the absolute propriety\r\nof no longer speaking of \"national\" but of \"international\" economy. It\r\nis the world's market that now regulates the price of numberless\r\nproducts of industry and agriculture, and that controls the social\r\nposition of nations. The productive domain, that, in the near future,\r\nwill dominate the world's market is that of the United States--a quarter\r\nfrom which is now proceeding the principal impetus toward\r\nrevolutionizing the relations of the world's market, and, along\r\ntherewith, all bourgeois society. According to the census of 1890, the\r\ncapital invested in industry in the United States has risen to 6,524\r\nmillion dollars, as against 2,790 million in 1880, an increase of 136\r\nper cent. The value of the industrial products rose during that period\r\nfrom 5,369 million dollars to 9,370 million, or 75 per cent. in round\r\nfigures, while the population increased only 25 per cent.[168] The\r\nUnited States has reached a point of development where it must export a\r\nlarge mass of products in order to be able to continue producing in\r\nsufficient quantities. Instead of importing articles of industry from\r\nEurope, these will henceforth be exported in large volumes, thereby\r\nupsetting commercial relations everywhere. What pass has been reached\r\nthere is indicated by the mammoth struggles between Capital and Labor,\r\nby the distress of the masses that has lasted years, and by the colossal\r\nincrease of bankruptcy during the last crisis. In 1879, 1880 and 1881\r\nthe sum absorbed in bankruptcies ran up to 82 million dollars in round\r\nfigures; in 1890 the amount was 190 million dollars, and in 1891 it rose\r\nto 331 million dollars. An instance will illustrate the gigantic measure\r\nof the concentration of capital in that country. In 1870, there were in\r\nthe United States 2,819 woolen mills, in which 96 million dollars were\r\ninvested as capital; in 1890 the number of these mills had sunk to\r\n1,312, but the capital invested had risen to 136 million. In 1870, on an\r\naverage, $34,000 sufficed to establish a woolen mill; in 1890, not less\r\nthan $102,000 was requisite. The increased demands upon capital forces\r\nthe building of stock corporations, which, in turn, promote the\r\nconcentration still more. Where the powers of a single capitalist do not\r\nsuffice, several of them join; they appoint technical overseers, who are\r\nwell paid, and they pocket, in the form of dividends, the profits which\r\nthe workingmen must raise. The restlessness of industry reaches its\r\nclassic form in the stock corporation, which demonstrates how useless\r\nthe person of the capitalist has become as a leader of industry.\r\n\r\nSeeing that this process of development and concentration is proceeding\r\nequally in all leading countries, the inevitable results of the anarchic\r\nmethod of production is \"over-production,\" the stoppage of trade, the\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the crisis is a consequence of the absence of any means\r\nwhatever whereby at any time the actual demand for certain goods can be\r\ngauged and controlled. There is no power in bourgeois society able to\r\nregulate production as a whole; the customers are spread over too vast\r\nan area; then also, their purchasing power, upon which depends their\r\npower of consumption, is affected by a number of causes, beyond the\r\ncontrol of the individual producer. Moreover, along with each individual\r\nproducer, are a number of others, whose productive powers and actual\r\nyield also are unknown to him. Each strives, with all the means at his\r\ncommand--cheap prices, advertisements, long credit, drummers, also\r\nsecret and crafty detraction of the quality of the goods of his\r\ncompetitor, the last of which is a measure that flourishes particularly\r\nat critical moments--to drive all other competitors from the field.\r\nProduction is wholly left to accident and to the judgment of\r\nindividuals. Accident often is more unfavorable than otherwise. Every\r\ncapitalist must produce a certain quantity of goods, in order that he\r\nmay exist; he is, however, driven to increase his output, partly because\r\nhis increase of revenues depends upon that, partly also because upon\r\nthat depend his prospects of being able to overcome his competitors, and\r\nkeep the field all to himself. For a while, the output is safe; the\r\ncircumstance tends to expansion and increased production. But prosperous\r\ntimes do not tempt one capitalist alone; they tempt them all. Thus\r\nproduction rises far above demand, and suddenly the market is found\r\noverstocked. Sales stop; prices fall; and production is curtailed. The\r\ncurtailment of production in any one branch implies a diminished demand\r\nfor workingmen, the lowering of wages and a retrenchment of consumption\r\nin the ranks of labor. A further stoppage of production and business in\r\nother departments is the necessary consequence. Small producers of all\r\nsorts--trademen, saloonkeepers, bakers, butchers, etc.,--whose\r\ncustomers are chiefly workingmen, lose the profitable sale of their\r\ngoods and likewise land in distress.\r\n\r\nThe way in which such a crisis works appears from a census on the\r\nunemployed which the Social Democratic Party of Hamburg undertook on\r\nFebruary 14, 1894. Of 53,756 workingmen who were interrogated, and of\r\nwhom 34,647 were married, with an aggregate family dependence of\r\n138,851, there were 18,422 who, during the last year, had been idle a\r\ntotal of 191,013 weeks; 5,084 persons had been idle from 1 to 5 weeks;\r\n8,741 from 6 to 10 weeks; 1,446 from 11 to 15 weeks; 984 from 16 to 20\r\nweeks; 2,167 more than 20 weeks. These are workingmen, who wished to\r\nwork, but who, in this best of all possible worlds, could find no work.\r\nThe sorry plight of these people may be imagined.\r\n\r\nAgain, one industry furnishes its raw material to another; one depends\r\nupon the other; it follows that all must suffer and pay for the blows\r\nthat fall upon any. The circle of participants and sufferers spreads\r\never wider. A number of obligations, assumed in the hope of a long\r\ncontinuance of prosperity, cannot be met, and thus new fuel is added to\r\nthe conflagration of the crisis, whose flames rise higher from month to\r\nmonth. An enormous mass of stored-up goods, tools, machinery, becomes\r\nalmost worthless. The goods are got rid of at great sacrifices. Not only\r\ntheir proprietor is thereby ruined, but also dozens of others who are\r\nthereby likewise forced to give up their goods under cost. During the\r\ncrisis itself, the method of production is all along improved with the\r\nview of meeting future competition; but this only prepares the ground\r\nfor new and still worse crises. After the crisis has lasted years, after\r\nthe surplusage of goods has been gradually done away with through sales\r\nat ruinous prices, through retrenchment of production, and through the\r\ndestruction of smaller concerns, society slowly begins to recover again.\r\nDemand rises, and production follows suit--slowly at first and cautious,\r\nbut, with the continuance of prosperity, the old vertigo sets in anew.\r\nEveryone is anxious to recover what he lost, and expects to be under\r\ncover before the next crisis breaks in. Nevertheless, seeing that all\r\ncapitalists foster the identical thought, and that each one improves his\r\nplant so as to head off the others, the catastrophe is soon brought on\r\nagain and with all the more fatal effect. Innumerable establishments\r\nrise and fall like balls at a game, and out of such continuous ups and\r\ndowns flows the wretched state of things that is witnessed at all\r\ncrises. These crises crowd upon one another in the measure that large\r\nproduction increases, and the competitive struggle--not between\r\nindividuals only, but between whole nations--becomes sharper. The\r\nscampering for customers, on a small scale, and for markets on a large\r\none, gains in fierceness, and ends finally in great losses. Goods and\r\nimplements are heaped mountain high, yet the masses of the people suffer\r\nhunger and want.\r\n\r\nThe autumn of the year 1890 brought new proof of the correctness of\r\nthis outline. After a long series of years of business depression,\r\nduring which, however, large capitalist development was steadily\r\nprogressing, an improvement in our economic life set in during 1887-8,\r\nstimulated in no slight degree by the extensive changes introduced in\r\nour army and navy systems. The upward movement continued during 1889 and\r\nup into the first quarter of 1890. During this period, a number of new\r\nestablishments began to crop up everywhere in several fields of\r\nindustry; a large number of others were enlarged and improved to the\r\nhighest point of technical perfection, and their capacity greatly\r\nincreased. In the same measure that this large capitalist development\r\nprogressed, a larger and ever larger number of establishments passed\r\nfrom the hands of individual capitalists into stock corporations--a\r\nchange that ever is more or less connected with an increase of\r\nproduction. The new issues, that, as a result of these combinations and\r\ndue also to the increase of the public debt, were contracted in the\r\ninternational money market, ran up in 1887 to about 4,000 million marks;\r\nin 1888, to 5,500 million; and in 1889, to even 7,000 million. On the\r\nother hand, the capitalists of all countries were endeavoring to\r\n\"regulate\" prices and production by means of national and international\r\nagreements. Rings and Trusts sprang up like mushrooms over night. The\r\nmajority, often all the capitalists concerned in the more important\r\nbranches of production, formed syndicates, by means of which prices were\r\nfixed, and production was to be regulated by the light of accurate\r\nstatistical information. Over-production was thus to be prevented. A\r\nmarvelous monopolization of industry, such as had never been seen, was\r\nthus achieved in the interest of the capitalists and at the expense of\r\nthe workingmen, and of the consumers in general. For a while it seemed\r\nas if capital had come into possession of the means that enabled it to\r\ncontrol the market in all directions, to the injury of the public and to\r\nits own greater glory. But appearances deceived. The laws of capitalist\r\nproduction proved themselves stronger than the shrewdest representatives\r\nof the system who imagined they held in their hands the power to\r\nregulate it. The crisis set in. One of the largest international\r\nbusiness houses of England fell and involved a number of others in its\r\nfall. All exchanges and markets--of London, Paris, Vienna and Berlin, as\r\nfar as St. Petersburg, New York and Calcutta--shook and trembled. It had\r\nagain been shown that the profoundest calculations prove deceptive, and\r\nthat capitalist society cannot escape its fate.\r\n\r\nAll this notwithstanding, capitalism proceeds on its course: it can be\r\nno other than it is. By means of the forms that its course dictates, it\r\nthrows all the laws of capitalist economics overboard. \"Free\r\ncompetition,\" the Alpha and Omega of bourgeois society, is to bring the\r\nfittest to the top of the enterprises; but the stock corporation\r\nremoves all individuality, and places the crown upon that combination\r\nthat has the longest purse and the strongest grip. The syndicates,\r\nTrusts and rings carry the point still further. Whole branches of\r\nindustry are monopolized; the individual capitalist becomes but a pliant\r\nlink in a chain, held by a capitalist committee. _A handful of\r\nmonopolists set themselves up as lords of the world and dictate to it\r\nthe price of goods, to the workingmen their wages and conditions of\r\nlife._\r\n\r\nThe whole course of this development brings out how utterly superfluous\r\nthe individual capitalist has become, and that production, conducted\r\nupon a national and international scale, is the goal toward which\r\nsociety steers--with this difference, that, in the end, this organized\r\nproduction will redound to the benefit, not of a class, but of the\r\ncollectivity.\r\n\r\nThe economic revolution just sketched, and which is driving bourgeois\r\nsociety with great swiftness to its apogee, becomes more pointed from\r\nyear to year. While Europe finds itself pressed more and more in its\r\nforeign markets, and finally on its own territory, by the competition of\r\nthe United States, latterly enemies have risen in the East also,\r\nrendering still more critical the plight of Europe, and at the same time\r\nthreatening the United States also. This danger proceeds from the\r\nprogress of English India toward becoming a great agricultural and\r\nindustrial State--a progress that, in the first place, looks to the\r\nmeeting of the wants of India's own two hundred million strong\r\npopulation, and, in the second place, develops into a mortal enemy of\r\nEnglish and German industry in particular. And still another industrial\r\nState is beginning to rise in the East--_Japan_. According to the\r\n\"Kreuzzeitung\" of February 20, 1895, \"during the last ten years, Japan\r\nhas imported from Europe the best perfected machinery for setting up\r\nindustrial plants, especially in cotton spinning. In 1889, she had only\r\n35,000 spindles; now she has over 380,000. In 1889, Japan imported 31\r\nmillion pounds of raw cotton; in 1891, she imported 67 million. She is\r\nsteadily decreasing her importations of manufactured articles, and\r\nincreasing her importations of raw material, which she then retransports\r\nin the shape of manufactures. During the last year Hongkong, a European\r\ncolony, bought over two million marks of Japanese cotton goods. The\r\nJapanese are providing their own markets with goods that formerly were\r\nimported from Europe and the United States. They are also exporting to\r\nOriental markets, that were formerly provided from western sources. They\r\nare exporting matches and soap; they are manufacturing clothing, felt\r\nhats and hosiery; they have glass-blowing establishments, breweries,\r\ntileries, tan-yards and rope-walks.\"\r\n\r\nThe further expansion of Japan's industry steadily reduces importations\r\nfrom Europe and the United States, and simultaneously places it in\r\ncondition to turn up in the world's market as a competitor. Should\r\nChina also, as a result of the Japanese-Chinese war, be compelled to\r\nopen her immense territory to European culture, then, in view of the\r\ngreat adaptability and marvelous unpretentiousness of the Chinese\r\nworkingman, another competitive power will have risen, more dangerous\r\nthan any that the world's market has yet had to reckon with. Truly, the\r\nfuture of bourgeois society is threatened from all sides with grave\r\ndangers, and there is no way to escape them.\r\n\r\nThus _the crisis becomes permanent and international_. It is a result of\r\nall the markets being overstocked with goods. And yet, still more could\r\nbe produced; but the large majority of people suffer want in the\r\nnecessaries of life because they have no income wherewith to satisfy\r\ntheir wants by purchase. They lack clothing, underwear, furniture,\r\nhomes, food for the body and mind, and means of enjoyment, all of which\r\nthey could consume in large quantities. But all that does not exist to\r\nthem. Hundreds of thousands of workingmen are even thrown upon the\r\nsidewalk, and rendered wholly unable to consume because their\r\nlabor-power has become \"_superfluous_\" to the capitalists. Is it not\r\nobvious that our social system suffers of serious ailments? How could\r\nthere be any \"over-production\" when there is no lack of capacity to\r\nconsume, i. e., of wants that crave satisfaction? Obviously, it is not\r\nproduction, in and of itself, that breeds these unhallowed conditions\r\nand contradictions: _it is the system under which production is carried\r\non, and the product is distributed_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn human society, all its members are bound to one another by a thousand\r\nthreads; and these threads are all the more numerous in proportion to a\r\npeople's grade of culture. If disturbances set in, they are forthwith\r\nfelt by all. Disturbances in production affect distribution and\r\nconsumption; and _vice versa_. The feature of capitalist production is\r\nthe concentration of property into ever fewer hands and into ever larger\r\nestablishments. In distribution, on the contrary, an opposite current is\r\nnoticeable. Whoever, due to the destructive effect of competition, is\r\nstricken from the list of independent producers, seeks, in nine cases\r\nout of ten, to squeeze himself as a dealer between the producer and the\r\nconsumer, and thus to earn his livelihood.\r\n\r\nHence the striking phenomenon of the increase of the middleman--dealers,\r\nshopkeepers, hucksters, commissioners, brokers, agents, saloonkeepers,\r\netc. Most of these, among whom women are strongly represented, lead a\r\nlife of worries and a needy existence. Many are compelled, in order to\r\nkeep their heads above water, to speculate upon the lowest passions of\r\nman and to promote them in all manner of ways. Hence the marvelous swing\r\nof the most repulsive advertisements, particularly in all matters the\r\nobject of which is the gratification of sexual pleasures.\r\n\r\nIt is undeniable, and, viewed from a higher viewpoint, it is also\r\ncheering, that the current for a greater enjoyment of life runs deep in\r\nmodern society. Man begins to understand that, in order to be human, a\r\nlife worthy of human beings is requisite, and the feeling is expressed\r\nin such form as corresponds with the respective conceptions of the\r\nenjoyment of life. As far as the distribution of its wealth is\r\nconcerned, society has become much more _aristocratic_ than at any\r\nprevious period. Between the richest and the poorest, the chasm is wider\r\nto-day than ever before. On the other hand, with regard to its ideas and\r\nlaws, society has become more _democratic_.[169] Hence the masses strive\r\nafter greater equality; and, seeing that in their ignorance they know\r\nnot yet the path by which to attain their wishes, they seek equality in\r\nthe imitation of the upper classes by furnishing themselves with\r\nwhatever pleasures are within their reach. All possible artificial means\r\nare resorted to in order to exploit this tendency; the consequences are\r\noften serious. The gratification of a justified desire thus leads in a\r\nnumber of cases to wrong paths, often to crime; and society intervenes\r\nin its own way, without thereby improving matters in the least.\r\n\r\nThe increasing mass of the middlemen draws many evils in its wake.\r\nAlthough this class toils arduously and works under the load of heavy\r\ncares, _the majority are parasites, they are unproductively active, and\r\nthey live upon the labors of others, just the same as the capitalist\r\nclass_. Higher prices is the inevitable consequence of this industry.\r\nFood and other goods rise in price in such manner that they often cost\r\ntwice or many times as much as the producer received for them.[170] If\r\nit is thought unadvisable or impossible to materially raise the price of\r\nthe goods, lest consumption decline, they are artificially deteriorated,\r\nand recourse is had _to adulteration of food, and to false weights and\r\nmeasures_, in order to make the requisite profits. The chemist Chevalier\r\nreports that he knows, among the several adulterations of food, 32 for\r\ncoffee, 30 for wine, 28 for chocolate, 24 for meal, 23 for brandy, 20\r\nfor bread, 19 for milk, 10 for butter, 9 for olive oil, 6 for sugar,\r\netc. The Chamber of Commerce of Wesel reported in 1870 that an extensive\r\nsystem of swindle was practiced in the shops in the sale of\r\nready-weighed articles: for 1 pound, 24 or 26 pennyweights were given,\r\nand in that way twice as much was gained as the difference in the price.\r\nWorkingmen and small traders who get their goods on credit and who must,\r\naccordingly, submit, even when the fraud is obvious, fare worst of all.\r\nGrave abuses are also perpetrated in bakeries. Swindling and cheating\r\nare inseparable from our modern conditions, and certain government\r\ninstitutions, such as high indirect taxes, are direct incentives\r\nthereto. The laws against the adulteration of food alter matters but\r\nlittle. The struggle for existence compels the swindlers to resort to\r\never shrewder means, nor is there any thorough and strict inspection.\r\nLeading and influential circles of our ruling classes are even\r\ninterested in the system of swindle. Under the pretext that, in order to\r\ndiscover adulterations a more comprehensive and more expensive\r\nadministrative apparatus is required, and that \"legitimate business\"\r\nwould suffer thereby, almost all inspection, worthy of the name, is\r\nlamed. If, however, laws and measures of inspection do actually\r\nintervene, they affect a considerable rise in the price of the\r\nunadulterated products, seeing that the lower price was made possible\r\nonly by adulteration.\r\n\r\nWith the view of avoiding these evils of trade, evils that, as ever and\r\neverywhere, are hardest on the masses, \"Consumers' Associations\" have\r\nbeen set up. In Germany, the \"Consumers' Association\" plan, especially\r\namong the military and civil service employees, reaches such a point\r\nthat numerous business houses have been ruined, and many are not far\r\nfrom the same fate. These Associations demonstrate the superfluousness\r\nof trade in a differently organized society.[171] In that consists their\r\nprincipal merit. The material advantages are not great for the members;\r\nneither are the facilities that they offer enough to enable the members\r\nto discover any material improvement in their condition. Not\r\ninfrequently is their administration poor, and the members must pay for\r\nit. In the hands of capitalists, these Associations even become an\r\nadditional means to chain the workingman to the factory, and they are\r\nused as weapons to depress wages. The founding of these \"Consumers'\r\nAssociations\" is, however, a symptom that the evils of trade and at\r\nleast the superfluousness of the middlemen have been realized in wide\r\ncircles. Society will reach that point of organization at which trade\r\nbecomes wholly superfluous; the product will reach the consumer without\r\nthe intervention of any middlemen other than those who attend to its\r\ntransportation from place to place, and who are in the service of\r\nsociety. A natural demand, that flows from the collective procurement of\r\nfood, _is its collective preparation for the table upon a large scale,\r\nwhereby a further and enormous saving would be made of energy, space,\r\nmaterial and all manner of expenditures_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe economic revolution in industry and transportation has spread to\r\nagriculture also, and in no slight degree. Commercial and industrial\r\ncrises are felt in the country as well. Many relatives of families\r\nlocated in the country are partially or even wholly engaged in\r\nindustrial establishments in cities, and this sort of occupation is\r\nbecoming more and more common because the large farmers find it\r\nconvenient _to convert on their own farms a considerable portion of\r\ntheir produce_. They thereby save the high cost of transporting the raw\r\nproduct--potatoes that are used for spirits, beets for sugar, grain for\r\nflour or brandy or beer. Furthermore, they have on their own farms\r\ncheaper and more willing labor than can be got in the city, or in\r\nindustrial districts. Factories and rent are considerably cheaper, taxes\r\nand licenses lower, seeing that, to a certain extent, the landed\r\nproprietors are themselves lawgivers and law officers: from their midst\r\nnumerous representatives are sent to the Reichstag: not infrequently\r\nthey also control the local administration and the police department.\r\nThese are ample reasons for the phenomenon of increasing numbers of\r\nfunnel-pipes in the country. Agriculture and industry step into ever\r\ncloser interrelation with each other--an advantage that accrues mainly\r\nto the large landed estates.\r\n\r\nThe point of capitalist development reached in Germany also by\r\nagriculture has partially called forth conditions similar to those found\r\nin England and the United States. As with the small and middle class\r\nindustries, so likewise with the small and middle class farms, they are\r\nswallowed up by the large. A number of circumstances render the life of\r\nthe small and middle class farmer ever harder, and ripen him for\r\nabsorption by the large fellow.\r\n\r\nNo longer do the one-time conditions, as they were still known a few\r\ndecades ago, prevail in the country. Modern culture now pervades the\r\ncountry in the remotest corners. Contrary to its own purpose, militarism\r\nexercises a certain revolutionary influence. The enormous increase of\r\nthe standing army weighs, in so far as the blood-tax is concerned,\r\nheaviest of all upon the country districts. The degeneration of\r\nindustrial and city life compels the drawing of by far the larger\r\nportion of soldiers from the rural population. When the farmer's son,\r\nthe day laborer, or the servant returns after two or three years from\r\nthe atmosphere of the city and the barracks, an atmosphere not exactly\r\nimpregnated with high moral principles;--when he returns as the carrier\r\nand spreader of venereal diseases, he has also become acquainted with a\r\nmass of new views and wants whose gratification he is not inclined to\r\ndiscontinue. Accordingly, he makes larger demands upon life, and wants\r\nhigher wages; his frugality of old went to pieces in the city.\r\nTransportation, ever more extended and improved, also contributes toward\r\nthe increase of wants in the country. Through intercourse with the city,\r\nthe rustic becomes acquainted with the world from an entirely new and\r\nmore seductive side: he is seized with new ideas: he learns of the wants\r\nof civilization, thitherto unknown to him. All that renders him\r\ndiscontented with his lot. On top of that, the increasing demands of the\r\nState, the province, the municipality hit both farmer and farmhand, and\r\nmake them still more rebellious.\r\n\r\nTrue enough, many farm products have greatly risen in value during this\r\nperiod, but not in even measure with the taxes and the cost of living.\r\nOn the other hand, transmarine competition in food materially\r\ncontributes toward reducing prices: this reduces incomes: the same can\r\nbe counterbalanced only by improved management: and nine-tenths of the\r\nfarmers lack the means thereto. Moreover, the farmer does not get for\r\nhis product the price paid by the city: he has to deal with the\r\nmiddlemen: and these hold him in their clutches. The broker or dealer,\r\nwho at given seasons traverses the country and, as a rule, himself sells\r\nto other middlemen, wants to make his profits: the gathering of many\r\nsmall quantities gives him much more trouble than a large invoice from a\r\nsingle large holder: the small farmer receives, as a consequence, less\r\nfor his goods than the large farmer. Moreover, the quality of the\r\nproducts from the small farmer is inferior: the primitive methods that\r\nare there generally pursued have that effect: and that again compels the\r\nsmall farmer to submit to lower prices. Again, the farm owner or tenant\r\ncan often not afford to wait until the price of his goods rises. He has\r\npayments to meet--rent, interest, taxes; he has loans to cancel and\r\ndebts to settle with the broker and his hands. These liabilities are due\r\non fixed dates: he must sell however unfavorable the moment. In order to\r\nimprove his land, to provide for co-heirs, children, etc., the farmer\r\nhas contracted a mortgage: he has no choice of creditor: thus his plight\r\nis rendered all the worse. High interest and stated payments of arrears\r\ngive him hard blows. An unfavorable crop, or a false calculation on the\r\nproper crop, for which he expected a high price, carry him to the very\r\nbrink of ruin. Often the purchaser of the crop and the mortgagee are one\r\nand the same person. The farmers of whole villages and districts thus\r\nfind themselves at the mercy of a few creditors. The farmers of hops,\r\nwine and tobacco in Southern Germany; the truck farmers on the Rhine;\r\nthe small farmers in Central Germany--all are in that plight. The\r\nmortgagee sucks them dry; he leaves them, apparent owners of a field,\r\nthat, in point of fact, is theirs no longer. The capitalist vampire\r\noften finds it more profitable to farm in this way than, by seizing the\r\nland itself and selling it, or himself doing the farming. Thus many\r\nthousand farmers are carried on the registers as proprietors, who, in\r\nfact, are no longer such. Thus, again, many a large farmer--unskilled in\r\nhis trade, or visited by misfortune, or who came into possession under\r\nunfavorable circumstances--also falls a prey to the executioner's axe of\r\nthe capitalist. The capitalist becomes lord of the land; with the view\r\nof making double gains he goes into the business of \"butchering\r\nestates:\" he parcels out the domain because he can thereby get a larger\r\nprice than if he sold it in lump: then also he has better prospects of\r\nplying his usurious trade if the proprietors are many and small holders.\r\nIt is well known that city houses with many small apartments yield the\r\nlargest rent. A number of small holders join and buy a portion of the\r\nparcelled-out estate: the capitalist benefactor is ready at hand to pass\r\nlarger tracts over to them on a small cash payment, securing the rest by\r\nmortgage bearing good interest. This is the milk in the cocoanut. If the\r\nsmall holder has luck and he succeeds, by utmost exertion, to extract a\r\ntolerable sum from the land, or to obtain an exceptionally cheap loan,\r\nthen he can save himself; otherwise he fares as shown above.\r\n\r\nIf a few heads of cattle die on the hands of the farm-owner or tenant, a\r\nserious misfortune has befallen him; if he has a daughter who marries,\r\nher outfit augments his debts, besides his losing a cheap labor-power;\r\nif a son marries, the youngster wants a piece of land or its equivalent\r\nin money. Often this farmer must neglect necessary improvements: if his\r\ncattle and household do not furnish him with sufficient manure--a not\r\nunusual circumstance--then the yield of the farm declines, because its\r\nowner cannot buy fertilizers: often he lacks the means to obtain better\r\nseed. The profitable application of machinery is denied him: a rotation\r\nof crops, in keeping with the chemical composition of his farm, is often\r\nnot to be thought of. As little can he turn to profit the advantages\r\nthat science and experience offer him in the conduct of his domestic\r\nanimals: the want of proper food, the want of proper stabling and\r\nattention, the want of all other means and appliances prevent him.\r\nInnumerable, accordingly, are the causes that bear down upon the small\r\nand middle class farmer, drive him into debt, and his head into the\r\nnoose of the capitalist or the large holder.\r\n\r\nThe large landholders are generally intent upon buying up the small\r\nholdings, and thereby \"rounding up\" their estates. The large capitalist\r\nmagnates have a predilection for investments in land, this being the\r\nsafest form of property, one, moreover, that, with an increasing\r\npopulation, rises in value without effort on the part of the owners.\r\nEngland furnishes the most striking instance of this particular increase\r\nof value. Although due to international competition in agricultural\r\nproducts and cattle-raising, the yield of the land decreased during the\r\nlast decades, nevertheless, seeing that in Scotland two million acres\r\nwere converted into hunting grounds, that in Ireland four million acres\r\nlie almost waste, that in England the area of agriculture declined from\r\n19,153,900 acres in 1831, to 15,651,605 in 1880, a loss of 3,484,385\r\nacres, which have been converted into meadow lands, rent increased\r\nconsiderably. The aggregate rent from country estates amounted, in\r\npounds sterling, to:--\r\n\r\n\r\n      Countries.          1857.       1875.       1880.

Although, since 1880, due\r\nto the ever sharper international competition in food, the agricultural\r\nconditions of England and Ireland have hardly improved, the large\r\nEnglish landlords have not yet ventured upon such large demands upon the\r\npopulation as have the continental, the German large landlords in\r\nparticular. England knows no agricultural tariffs; and the demand for a\r\nminimum price, fixed by government, of such nature that they have been\r\nstyled \"price raisers\" and as the large landlords of the East Elbe\r\nregion together with their train-bands in the German Reichstag are\r\ninsisting on at the cost of the propertyless classes, would raise in\r\nEngland a storm of indignation.\r\n\r\nAccording to the agricultural statistics gathered in Germany on June 2,\r\n1882, the farms fell into the following categories according to size:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       Percentage of\r\n     Area.

In\r\nthe fertile districts of Southern Germany, 3 to 4 hectares are\r\nconsidered good ground to support a peasant family on. This minimum is\r\nreached in Germany by not four million farms, and only about 6 per cent.\r\nof the farmers have holdings large enough to enable them to get along in\r\ncomfort. Not less than 3,222,270 farmers conduct industrial or\r\ncommercial pursuits besides agriculture. It is a characteristic feature\r\nof the lands under cultivation that the farms of less than 50\r\nhectares--5,200,000 in all--contained only 3,747,677 hectares of grain\r\nlands, whereas the farms of more than 50 hectares--66,000 in round\r\nfigures--contained 9,636,246 hectares. One and a quarter per cent. of\r\nthe farms contained 2½ times more grain land than the other 98-3/4 per\r\ncent. put together.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the picture presented by these statistics falls by far short of\r\nthe reality. It has not been ascertained among how many owners these\r\n5,276,344 farms are divided. The number of owners is far smaller than\r\nthat of the farms themselves: many are the owners of dozens of farms: it\r\nis in the instance of large farms, in particular, that many are held by\r\none proprietor. A knowledge of the concentration of land is of the\r\nhighest socio-political importance, yet on this point the agricultural\r\nstatistics of 1882 leave us greatly in the lurch. A few facts are,\r\nnevertheless, ascertained from other sources, and they give an\r\napproximate picture of the reality. The percentages of large landed\r\nproperty--over 100 hectares--to the aggregate agricultural property was\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n      Provinces.  Percentage.         Provinces.    Percentage.\r\n    Pomerania        64.87          Brandenburg        42.60\r\n    Posen            61.22          Silesia            42.14\r\n    West Prussia     54.41          Saxony             30.89\r\n    East Prussia     41.79          Schleswig-Holstein 18.03\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the memorial of the Prussian Minister of Agriculture,\r\npublished in the bulletin of the Prussian Bureau of Statistics, the\r\nnumber of middle class farms sank, from 354,610 with 35,260,084 acres,\r\nin 1816, to 344,737 with 33,498,433 acres, in 1859. The number of these\r\nfarms had, accordingly, decreased within that period by 9,873, and\r\npeasant property had been wiped out to the volume of 1,711,641 acres.\r\nThe inquiry extended only to the provinces of Prussia, Posen (from 1823\r\non), Pomerania, exclusive of Stralsund; Brandenburg, Saxony, Silesia,\r\nand Westphalia.\r\n\r\nWhat disappears as peasant property usually goes into large estates. In\r\n1885, in the province of Pomerania, 62 proprietors held 118 estates; in\r\n1891, however, the same number of proprietors held 203 estates with an\r\narea of 147,139 hectares. Altogether, there were in the province of\r\nPomerania, in 1891, 1,353 noble and bourgeois landlords, owning 2,258\r\nestates with 1,247,201 hectares.[172] The estates averaged 551 hectares\r\nin size.\r\n\r\nOur eastern provinces give this table of landlords for the year 1888:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Prince of Hohenlohe-Oehringen   39,365 hectares\r\n    Prince of Sigmaringen           29,611    \"\r\n    Prince of Thurn and Taxis       24,482    \"\r\n    Prince Bismarck                 18,600    \"\r\n    Prince Radziwill                16,398    \"\r\n    Duke of Milzinski               13,933    \"\r\n    Representative Kennemann        10,482    \"\r\n    Duke Serg. v. Czarnecki          9,263    \"\r\n    v. Hansemann                     7,734    \"\r\n        Etc., etc., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe see that we here have to do with owners of latifundia of first rank;\r\nand a portion of these gentlemen own also large estates in Southern\r\nGermany and Austria.\r\n\r\nAccording to Conrad,[173] there were in the year 1888, in East Prussia,\r\n547 entails, of which 153 were instituted before the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century. Entailed land is property that an heir can neither\r\nmortgage, divide nor alienate. The owner may go into bankruptcy through\r\na dissolute life, but the entail and the income that flows therefrom\r\nremain unseizable. These entails, which only the very rich can\r\ninstitute, are steadily increasing in number since the last decades. The\r\n547 entails in existence in the eastern provinces of Prussia in 1888,\r\nheld by 529 persons, 20 of whom were bourgeois, embraced 1,408,860\r\nhectares, or 2,454 hectares on an average. According to the statistical\r\nfigures, submitted in the spring of 1894 by the Prussian Minister of\r\nAgriculture to the Agrarian Commission, the entails of Prussia embraced\r\nat that time 1,833,754 hectares with a net income of 22,992,000 marks.\r\nEstimating the holders of entails at 550, each has an unseizable income\r\nof 41,800 marks. Assuming, however, that these entails are concentrated\r\nin one province, it would mean that the whole province of\r\nSchleswig-Holstein, with an area of 1,890,000 hectares, belonged to 550\r\nowners. In 1888 there were in the eastern provinces of Prussia 154\r\npersons--among them 15 ruling Princes (the Kings of Prussia, Saxony,\r\netc.); 89 Dukes, other Princes and Counts; 40 noblemen and 10\r\nbourgeois--who alone owned 1,830 estates aggregating 1,768,648 hectares\r\nof land. Probably, the property of these persons has in the meantime\r\nincreased considerably, seeing that a good portion of the net incomes\r\nfrom these estates is expended in acquiring new ones. The nobility of\r\nthe first and second rank are the principal elements engaged in this\r\ngigantic concentration of landed property; but they are closely followed\r\nby the aristocracy of finance, who, with increasing predilection, invest\r\ntheir wealth in land, consisting mainly in magnificent woods, stocked\r\nwith roe, deer and wild boar, that the owners may gratify their passion\r\nfor the hunt. A large number of the baronial manors consist of the\r\nestates of dispossessed peasants, who were driven from their homes and\r\nreduced to day laborers. According to Neumann, in the provinces of East\r\nand West Prussia alone, there were from twelve to thirteen thousand\r\nsmall holdings appropriated in that way between 1825 to 1859. This\r\nprocess of dispossessing, proletarianizing the country population by the\r\ncapitalist landlords, has the laying waste of the land as a natural\r\nconsequence. The population emigrates, or moves to the cities and\r\nindustrial centers. Woods and meadows gain upon cultivated lands, the\r\nremaining territories are operated with machinery, that render human\r\nlabor superfluous, or that need such only for short periods during the\r\nplowing and sowing seasons, or when the crops are gathered. The rapidly\r\nincreasing number of movable steam engines, already mentioned, consists\r\nmainly of engines employed in the cultivation of the land. The decrease\r\nof the rural population, resulting upon these and other causes of\r\nsecondary nature, is sharply expressed in the statistics on population.\r\nWithin the eight old provinces of Prussia, the proportion between the\r\nrural and the city population revealed, between 1867 and 1890, the\r\nfollowing progression:--\r\n\r\n\r\n      Year.      City Population.  Country Population.\r\n    1867             7,452,000        16,568,000\r\n    1890            11,783,000        18,173,000\r\n                    ----------        ----------\r\n        Increase     4,331,000         1,605,000\r\n                  = 58 per cent.    = 9.7 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rapidity is obvious with which the city is surpassing the country\r\npopulation. But the situation is still more unfavorable to the country\r\nif the fact is considered that 148 communities, with from 5,000 to\r\n40,000 inhabitants, and aggregating a population of 1,281,000 strong,\r\nare included in the rural but really belong to the industrial districts.\r\nThey are essentially proletarian villages, located near large cities.\r\nFurthermore, 647 communities, with from 2,000 to 5,000 inhabitants, and\r\naggregating a population of 1,884,000, are likewise included in the\r\nrural, while, to a perceptible degree, they belong to the industrial\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\nSimilar conditions exist in Saxony and Southern Germany. In Baden and\r\nWurtemberg also the population of many districts is on the decline. The\r\nsmall farmer can no longer hold his head above water; to thousands upon\r\nthousands of them the fate of a factory hand is inevitable; they enter\r\nthe field of industry; and, with the help of their families, they\r\ncultivate during leisure hours the plot of land that may still be\r\ntheirs. At the same time the large landlord's hunger for land knows no\r\nbounds; his appetite increases the more peasant lands he devours.\r\n\r\nAs in Germany so are things developing in neighboring Austria, where\r\nlarge landed property has long ruled almost unchecked. The difference\r\nthere is that the Catholic Church shares the land with the nobility and\r\nthe bourgeoisie. The process of smoking-out the farmer is in full swing\r\nin Austria. All manner of efforts are put forth in order to push the\r\npeasants and mountaineers of Tyrol, Salzburg, Steiermark, Upper and\r\nLower Austria, etc., off their inherited patrimony and to drive them to\r\nrelinquish their property. The spectacle, once presented to the world by\r\nEngland and Scotland, is now on the boards of the most beautiful and\r\ncharming regions of Austria. Enormous tracts of land are bought in lump\r\nby rich men, and what cannot be bought outright is leased. Access to the\r\nvalleys, manors, hamlets and even houses is thus barred by these new\r\nmasters, and stubborn owners of separate small holdings are driven by\r\nall manner of chicaneries to dispose of their property at any price to\r\nthese wealthy owners of the woodlands. Old farmlands, on which numerous\r\ngenerations have been supported for thousands of years, are being\r\ntransformed into wilderness, in which the roe and the deer house, while\r\nthe mountains, that the noble or bourgeois capitalist calls his own,\r\nbecome the abode of large herds of chamois. Whole communities are\r\npauperized, the turning of their cattle upon the Alpine pastures being\r\nmade impossible to them, or their right to do so being even disputed.\r\nAnd who is it that thus raises his hand against the peasant's property\r\nand independence? Princes, noblemen and rich bourgeois. Side by side\r\nwith Rothschild and Baron Mayer-Melnhof are found the Dukes of Koburg\r\nand Meiningen, the Princes of Hohenlohe, the Prince of Lichtenstein, the\r\nDuke of Braganza, Prince Rosenberg, Prince Pless, the Counts of\r\nSchoenfeld, Festetics, Schafgotsca, Trautmannsdorff, the hunting\r\nassociation of the Count of Karolysche, the hunting association of Baron\r\nGustaedtsche, the noble hunting association of Bluehnbacher, etc.\r\n\r\nLarge landed property is everywhere on the increase in Austria. The\r\nnumber of large landlords rose 9.5 per cent. from 1873 to 1891, and that\r\nmeans a considerable decrease of small holders: land cannot be\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nIn Lower Austria, of a total area embracing 3,544,596 yokes, 521,603\r\nwere taken up by large estates (247 owners), and 94,882 yokes by the\r\nChurch. Nine families alone owned, in the middle of the eighties,\r\n157,000 yokes, among these owners was the Count of Hoyos, with 54,000\r\nyokes. The area of Moravia is 2,222,190 hectares. Of these, the Church\r\nheld 78,496, 3.53 per cent.; 145 private persons held 525,632, and one\r\nof these alone held 107,247 hectares. Of Austrian Silesia's area of\r\n514,085 hectares, the Church owned 50,845, or 9.87 per cent.; 36\r\nlandlords owned 134,226, or 26.07 per cent. The area of Bohemia is\r\n5,196,700 hectares: of these the clergy owned 103,459 hectares; 362\r\nprivate persons owned 1,448,638. This number is distributed among Prince\r\nColloredo-Mansfeld with 58,239 hectares; Prince Fuerstenberg with\r\n39,814; Imperial Duke Waldstein with 37,989; Prince Lichtenstein with\r\n37,937; the Count of Czerin with 32,277; the Count of Clam-Gallas with\r\n31,691; Emperor Franz Joseph with 28,800; the Count von Harrach with\r\n28,047; Prince von Lobkowitz with 27,684; Imperial Count Kinsky with\r\n26,265; the Count of Buquoy with 25,645; the Prince of Thurn and Taxis\r\nwith 24,777; Prince Schwarzenberg with 24,037; Prince\r\nMetternich-Winneburg with 20,002; Prince Auersperg with 19,960; Prince\r\nWindischgraetz with 19,920 hectares, etc.[174]\r\n\r\nThe absorption by the large landlords of the small holdings in land\r\nfrequently proceeds in \"alarming manner.\" For instance, in the judicial\r\ndistrict of Aflenz, community of St. Ilgen, an Alpine hill of over 5,000\r\nyokes, with pasture ground for 300 head of cattle, and a contiguous\r\npeasant estate of 700 yokes, was all converted into a hunting ground.\r\nThe same thing happened with Hoellaep, located in the community of\r\nSeewiesen, which had pasture land for 200 head of cattle. In the same\r\njudicial district of Aflenz, 47 other pieces of land, holding 840 head\r\nof cattle, were gradually absorbed and turned into hunting grounds.\r\nSimilar doings are reported from all parts of the Alps. In Steiermark, a\r\nnumber of peasants find it more profitable to sell the hay to the lordly\r\nhunters as _feed for the game in winter_, than give it to their own\r\ncattle. In the neighborhood of Muerzzuschlag, some peasants no longer\r\nkeep cattle, but sell all the feed for the support of the game.\r\n\r\nIn the judicial district of Schwarz, 7, and in the judicial district of\r\nZell, 16 Alpine hills, formerly used for pasture, were \"cashiered\" by\r\nthe new landlords and converted into hunting grounds. The whole region\r\nof the Karwendel mountain has been closed to cattle. It is generally the\r\nhigh nobility of Austria and Germany, together with rich bourgeois\r\nupstarts, who bought up Alpine stretches of land of 70,000 yokes and\r\nmore at a clip and had them arranged for hunting parks. Whole villages,\r\nhundreds upon hundreds of holdings are thus wiped out of existence; the\r\ninhabitants are crowded off; and in the place of human beings, together\r\nwith cattle meet for their sustenance, roes, deer and chamois put in\r\ntheir appearance. Oddest of all, more than one of the men, who thus lay\r\nwhole provinces waste, is seen rising in the parliaments and declaiming\r\non the \"distress of landed property,\" and abuses his power to secure the\r\nprotection of Government in the shape of duties on corn, wood and meat,\r\nand premiums on brandy and sugar,--all at the expense of the\r\npropertyless masses.\r\n\r\nAccording to the census of the eighties, there were 8,547,285 farms in\r\nFrance; 2,993,450 farm owners had an average annual income of 300\r\nfrancs, the aggregate income of these being 22.5 per cent. of the total\r\nincome from farms; 1,095,850 farm owners had an average annual income of\r\n1,730 francs, the aggregate income of these being 47 per cent. of the\r\ntotal income from farms; 65,525 large landlords, owning 109,285 farms,\r\ndrew 25.4 per cent. of the total agricultural revenues:--_their\r\npossessions embraced more than one-half of the agricultural lands of\r\nFrance_.\r\n\r\nLarge agricultural property is becoming the standard in all countries of\r\ncivilization, and, in virtue of its political influence, it sways\r\nlegislation without regard to the welfare of the commonwealth.\r\nNevertheless, the tenure of agricultural land and its cultivation is of\r\nhigh importance to social development. Upon land and its productivity\r\ndepends first of all the population and its subsistence. Land can not be\r\nmultiplied at will, hence the question is of all the greater magnitude\r\nto everyone how the land is cultivated and exploited. Germany, whose\r\npopulation increases yearly by from 5,600,000 heads, needs a large\r\nsupply of breadstuffs and meat, if the prices of the principal\r\nnecessaries of life shall remain within the reach of the people.\r\n\r\nAt this point an important antagonism arises between the industrial and\r\nthe agricultural population. The industrial population, being\r\nindependent of agriculture, has a vital interest in cheap food: the\r\ndegree in which they are to thrive both as men and as workers depends\r\nupon that. Every rise in the price of food leads, either to further\r\nadulterations, or to a decline of exports, and thereby of wages as a\r\nconsequence of increased difficulties of competition. The question is\r\notherwise with the cultivator of the soil. As in the instance of the\r\nindustrial producer, the farmer is bent upon making the largest gains\r\npossible out of his trade, whatever line that may be in. If the\r\nimportation of corn and meat reduces the high prices for these articles\r\nand thereby lowers his profits, then he gives up raising corn and\r\ndevotes his soil to some other product that may bring larger returns: he\r\ncultivates sugar-beet for the production of sugar, potatoes and grain\r\nfor distilleries, instead of wheat and rye for bread. He devotes the\r\nmost fertile tracts to tobacco instead of vegetables. In the same way,\r\nthousands of hectares are used as horse pastures because horses for\r\nsoldiers and other purposes of war fetch good prices. On the other hand,\r\nextensive forests, that can be made fertile, are kept at present for the\r\nenjoyment of the hunting lords, and this often happens in neighborhoods\r\nwhere the dismantling of a few hectares of woodland and their conversion\r\nto agricultural purposes could be undertaken without thereby injuriously\r\naffecting the humidity of the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nUpon this particular point, forestry to-day denies the influence of\r\nwoodlands upon moisture. Woods should be allowed in large masses only at\r\nsuch places where the nature of the soil permits no other form of\r\ncultivation, or where the purpose is to furnish mountain regions with a\r\nprofitable vegetation, or with a check to the rapid running down of\r\nwater in order to prevent freshets and the washing away of the land.\r\nFrom this point of view, thousands of square kilometers of fertile land\r\ncould be reclaimed in Germany for agriculture. But such an alteration\r\nruns counter as well to the interests of the hierarchy of\r\noffice-holders--foresters--as to the private and hunting interests of\r\nthe large landlords, who are not inclined to forfeit their hunting\r\ngrounds and pleasures of the chase.\r\n\r\nTo what extent the process of rendering \"hands\" superfluous is\r\nprogressing in agriculture and in the industries therewith connected has\r\nbeen shown in the palpable depopulation of the rural districts of\r\nGermany. It may, furthermore, be specified that in the period between\r\n1885 and 1890, the decrease of the rural population in 74 districts east\r\nof the Elbe was above 2 per cent.; in 44 of these 74 districts it was\r\neven above 3 per cent. In western Prussia, a decrease was established of\r\nover 2 per cent. in 16 districts, in two of which the decrease exceeded\r\n3 per cent. Especially high was the percentage of decrease in those\r\nneighborhoods where large landlords figure as special dispensations of\r\nProvidence. In Wurtemberg, during the period between 1839 and 1885, the\r\npopulation of 22 peasant districts declined from 29,907 heads to\r\n19,213,--not less than 35.7 per cent. In East and West Prignitz, the\r\nrural population declined during the period of 1868-1885 from 100,000\r\nheads to 85,000,--15 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe decrease of the rural working population is marked also in England\r\nwhere, as well known, latifundia property reigns supreme. The\r\nprogression in the decrease of agricultural workers was there as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n      Sexes.        1861.         1871.      Decrease.\r\n    Males        1,833,652     1,328,151      505,501\r\n    Females        376,797       186,450      193,127\r\n                 ---------     ---------      -------\r\n        Total    2,210,449     1,514,601      698,628\r\n\r\n\r\nSince then the decrease has proceeded further. According to Dr. B. J.\r\nBrock, in the year 1885 there was the following yield per acre in\r\nbushels:--\r\n\r\n\r\n      Countries.      Wheat.   Barley.\r\n    Great Britain      35.2     37.8\r\n    Germany            18.7     23.6\r\n    France             16.0     19.5\r\n    Austria            15.5     16.8\r\n    Hungary            11.7     16.0\r\n\r\n\r\nThe difference in productivity between Great Britain and the other\r\ncountries is, we see, considerable, and it is attained through a more\r\nextensive operation of the soil. In Hungary also the number of persons\r\nengaged in agriculture has decreased considerably:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    1870          4,417,514\r\n    1880          3,669,177\r\n\r\n\r\na decrease of 748,457, or more than 17 per cent. in ten years. The\r\nagricultural lands passed into the hands of large magnates and\r\ncapitalists, who employed machines instead of human workers, and thus\r\nrendered the latter \"superfluous.\" These phenomena manifest themselves\r\neverywhere in agriculture,--just as in large industrial production. The\r\nproductivity of labor increases, and in the same measure a portion of\r\nthe working class is promoted to the sidewalk.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, this process has its evil consequences for woman\r\nalso. Her prospects of being a proprietor and housewife decline, and the\r\nprospects increase of her becoming a servant, a cheap hand for the large\r\nlandlord. As a sexual being she is more exposed even than in the city to\r\nthe illicit wishes and cravings of the master or his lieutenants. More\r\nso than in industry, on the land proprietary rights in the labor-power\r\nfrequently expand to proprietary rights over the whole person. Thus, in\r\nthe very midst of \"Christian\" Europe a quasi Turkish harem system has\r\ndeveloped. In the country, woman is isolated to a higher degree than in\r\nthe city. The magistrate or a close friend of his is her employer:\r\nnewspapers and a public opinion, to which she otherwise might look for\r\nprotection, there are none: furthermore, male labor itself is generally\r\nin a disgraceful state of dependence. But \"the heavens are away up, and\r\nthe Tsar is away off.\"\r\n\r\nThe census of occupation of 1882 established that, out of 5,273,344\r\nfarms, only 391,746, or 7½ per cent., employ machinery. Out of the\r\n24,999 large farms, however, containing over 100 hectares of land,\r\nmachinery was in use on 20,558, or 82¼ per cent. Naturally, it is the\r\nlarger farms only that can utilize machinery. The application of\r\nmachinery on a large surface, all of one product, engages labor only a\r\ncomparatively short time, the number of male and female hands,\r\nabsolutely needed on the place and for tending the cattle, is reduced,\r\nand after the field work is done, the day laborers are discharged. Thus\r\nwith us, just as in England and in a still higher degree in the United\r\nStates, a rural proletariat of grave aspect springs up. If, in view of\r\nthe shortness of the season, these workingmen demand correspondingly\r\nhigh wages when they are needed, their impudence is denounced; if, upon\r\ntheir discharge, they roam about in hunger and idleness, they are called\r\nvagabonds, are abused, and not infrequently dogs are set upon them to\r\nchase them from the yards as \"tramps,\" unwilling to work, and they are\r\nhanded over to the constabulary for the workhouse. A pretty social\r\n\"order.\"\r\n\r\nCapitalist exploitation of agriculture leads in all directions to\r\ncapitalist conditions. One set of our farmers, for instance, has for\r\nyears made enormous profits out of beet-root and the production of sugar\r\ntherewith connected. Our system of taxation favored the exportation of\r\nsugar, and it was so framed that the tax on beets yielded but an\r\ninfinitesimal revenue to the treasury of the Empire, the premium on the\r\nexportation of sugar being large enough to almost swallow the tax.\r\n\r\nThe rebate allowed the sugar manufacturers per double quintal was\r\nactually higher than the tax paid by them on beets; and this premium\r\nenabled them to sell large quantities of sugar at the expense of the\r\ndomestic tax-payers, and to extend ever more the cultivation of the\r\nsugar-beet. The profit that accrued from this system of taxation to\r\nabout 400 sugar factories was estimated at over 30 million marks for\r\n1889-1890: on an average 78,000 marks per factory. Several hundreds of\r\nthousands of hectares of land, previously devoted to raising grain, were\r\nturned into beet-root fields; factories upon factories were started, and\r\nare still being started; the inevitable consequence is an eventual\r\ncrash. The large returns yielded by the beet-root cultivation affected\r\nfavorably the price of land. It rose. The result was the buying up of\r\nthe small farms, whose owners, seduced by the high prices, allowed\r\nthemselves to be inveigled into selling. While the land was thus being\r\nused for industrial speculation, the raising of potatoes and grain was\r\nbeing confined to narrower fields, hence the increasing need of\r\nimportation of food from abroad. The demand exceeds the supply.\r\nThereupon, the large supply of foreign farm products and their cheaper\r\ntransportation from Russia, the Danubian Principalities, North and South\r\nAmerica, India, etc., finally leads to prices on which the domestic\r\nfarmers--weighed down with mortgages and taxes, and hampered by the\r\nsmallness of their farms, and their often faultily organized and\r\ndeficiently conducted farming--can no longer exist. High duties are then\r\nplaced upon importations; but these duties accrue only to the large\r\nfarmer; the small fellow profits little by them, or none at all; and\r\nthey become heavy burdens to the non-agricultural population. The\r\nadvantage of the few becomes the injury of the many; small farming\r\nretrogresses; for it there is no balm in Gilead. That the condition of\r\nthe small peasants in the tariff areas of Germany has been steadily\r\ndeteriorating, will be generally admitted. The advantages to the large\r\nfarmer from high duties, prohibitions of importations and measures of\r\nexclusion enable him all the more easily to buy out the small holder.\r\nThe large number of those who do not produce in meat and bread what they\r\nconsume themselves--and a glance at the statistics of occupation and\r\ndivision of the soil shows that these are by far the larger majority of\r\nthe farmers--even suffers a direct injury from the increased prices\r\nresulting upon higher tariffs and indirect taxes. An unfavorable crop,\r\nthat lowers still more the returns from the farm, not only aggravates\r\nthe pressure, but also increases the number of the agriculturists who\r\nare compelled to become purchasers of farm products themselves. Tariffs\r\nand indirect taxes can not improve the economic condition of the\r\nmajority of the farmers: he who has little or nothing to sell, what, to\r\nhim, does the tariff boot, be it never so high! The incumbrance of the\r\nsmall farmer and his final ruin are thereby promoted rather than\r\nchecked.\r\n\r\nFor Baden--overwhelmingly a State of small farms--the increase of\r\nmortgage indebtedness during the period of 1884-1894 is estimated at 140\r\nto 150 million marks. The mortgage indebtedness of the Bern peasants\r\naggregated in round figures 200 million francs in 1860; in 1890 it\r\naggregated 500 million francs. According to a report of the Bohemian\r\nrepresentative Gustave Eim, made to his constituents in 1893, the\r\nindebtedness that weighed upon the farms of Bohemia stood as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    1879       2,716,641,754 guilders\r\n    1889       3,105,587,363 guilders\r\n\r\n\r\nWe see that inside of that period the burden of indebtedness increased\r\n14.13 per cent.--that of small holdings 13.29 per cent., while that of\r\nthe large holdings increased only 3.77 per cent. The bulk of the\r\nincreased indebtedness fell to the share of middle class property.\r\n\r\nHow the cultivator of the soil operates his farm is--under the aegis of\r\nSt. Private Property--his own business. His private interest decides.\r\nWhat cares he about the commonwealth and its well-being? He has to look\r\nout for himself: so, then, stand aside! Does not the industrialist\r\nproceed on that plan? He produces obscene pictures, turns out immoral\r\nbooks, sets up factories for adulterating food. These and many other\r\noccupations are harmful to society: they undermine morality and incite\r\ncorruption. What does that matter! It brings in money, even more money\r\nthan moral pictures, scientific books, and honest dealing in\r\nunadulterated food. The industrialist, greedy after profits, needs to\r\nconcern himself only about escaping the too sharp eye of the police; he\r\ncan quietly pursue his shameful trade, assured that the money he will\r\nthereby rake in will earn for him the envy and esteem of society.\r\n\r\nThe Mammon character of our age is best typified by the Exchange and its\r\ndoings. Land and industrial products; means of transportation;\r\nmeteorologic and political conditions; scarcity and abundance;\r\nmass-misery and accidents; public debts, inventions and discoveries; the\r\nhealth, sickness and death of influential persons; war and rumors of\r\nwar, often started for the express purpose;--all this and much more is\r\nmade objects of speculation, for exploitation and mutual cheating. The\r\nmatadors of capital attain decided influence upon society, and, favored\r\nby the powerful means at their disposal and their connections, they\r\namass enormous fortunes. Cabinet ministers and whole Governments become\r\npuppets in their hands, compelled to act according as matadors of the\r\nExchange pull the wires behind the scenes. Not the State has the\r\nExchange, but the Exchange has the State in its power. Will he, nill he,\r\na Minister is often forced to water the upas tree, which he might prefer\r\nto tear up by the roots, but that he now must aid in growing.\r\n\r\nAll these facts, that, seeing the evils gain by the day in magnitude,\r\ndaily force themselves with increasing importunity upon the\r\nconsideration of everyone, demand speedy and radical help. But modern\r\nsociety stands bewildered before all these phenomena, just as certain\r\nanimals are said to stand before a mountain;[175] it turns like a horse\r\nin the treadmill, constantly in a circle,--lost, helpless, the picture\r\nof distress and stupidity. Those who would bring help are yet too weak;\r\nthose who should bring help still lack the necessary understanding;\r\nthose who could bring help will not, they rely upon force; at best, they\r\nthink with Madame Pompadour \"_apres nous le deluge_\" (after us the\r\ndeluge). But how if the deluge were to come before their departure from\r\nlife?\r\n\r\nThe flood rises and is washing out the foundations upon which our State\r\nand Social structure rests. All feel that the ground shakes, and that\r\nonly the strongest props can now stead. But these demand great\r\nsacrifices on the part of the ruling classes. There is the rub. Every\r\nproposition injurious to the material interests of the ruling classes,\r\nand that threatens their privileged position, is bitterly opposed and\r\nbranded as a scheme looking to the overthrow of the modern political and\r\nsocial order. Neither is the sick world to be cured without any danger\r\nto the privileges and immunities of the ruling classes, nor without\r\ntheir final abolition by the abolition of the classes themselves.\r\n\r\n\"The struggle for the emancipation of the working class is no struggle\r\nfor privileges, but a struggle for equal rights and equal duties; it is\r\na struggle for the abolition of all privileges\"--thus runs the programme\r\nof the Socialist Movement. It follows that half-measures and small\r\nconcessions are fruitless.\r\n\r\nUntil now, the ruling classes regard their privileged position as quite\r\nnatural and normal, as to the justice of which no doubt may be\r\nentertained. It is a matter of course, therefore, that they should\r\nobject and resolutely oppose every attempt to shake their prerogatives.\r\nEven propositions and laws, that affect neither the fundamental\r\nprinciples of the existing social order nor the privileged position of\r\nthe ruling classes, throw them into great commotion the moment their\r\npurses are or might be touched. Mountains of paper are filed in the\r\nparliaments full of speeches and printed matter, until the heaving\r\nmountains bring forth a ridiculous mouse. The simplest and most obvious\r\nquestions regarding the protection of Labor are met by them with such a\r\nresistance as though the existence of society hinged on such\r\nconcessions. After endless struggles a few concessions are finally wrung\r\nfrom them, and then they act as if they had sacrificed a large part of\r\ntheir fortunes. The same stubborn resistance do they display if the\r\npoint is the formal recognition of the equality of the oppressed\r\nclasses, to allow these, for instance, to have an equal voice with them\r\nin wage and other labor agreements.\r\n\r\nThis resistance to the simplest matters and the most obvious demands\r\nconfirms the old principle founded in experience, that no ruling class\r\ncan be convinced by _reasoning_, until the force of circumstances drives\r\nthem to sense and to submission. This force of circumstances lies in the\r\ndevelopment of society, and in the increasing intelligence awakened by\r\nthis very development among the oppressed. The class-antagonism--the\r\nsketch of our social conditions has pointed them out--grow more\r\npronounced, visible and sensible. Along therewith increases the\r\nunderstanding of the untenableness of the existing order among the\r\noppressed and exploited classes; their indignation mounts higher, and,\r\nas a result thereof, also the imperious demand for a change and for\r\nimproved conditions. By penetrating ever wider circles, such\r\nunderstanding of the situation finally conquers the vast majority of\r\nsociety, most directly interested in the change. In the same measure,\r\nhowever, as the popular understanding increases regarding the\r\nuntenableness of the existing order and the necessity of its radical\r\nchange, the power of resistance decreases on the part of the ruling\r\nclasses, whose power rests upon ignorance and lack of intelligence on\r\nthe part of the oppressed and exploited. This cross effect is evident;\r\nhence, everything that promotes it must be welcome. The progress made by\r\nlarge capitalization, on one side, is amply compensated, on the other,\r\nby the increasing perception by the proletariat of the contradiction in\r\nwhich the social order stands with the well-being of the enormous\r\nmajority. The dissolution and abolition of the social antagonisms may\r\ncost extraordinary pains, sacrifices and efforts, it may depend upon\r\nfactors that lie beyond the influence of the individual, or even of a\r\nclass. Nevertheless, the solution is reached the moment these\r\nantagonisms have reached their acme,--a point towards which they are\r\nrushing.\r\n\r\nThe measures to be adopted at the various phases of development depend\r\nupon the then conditions. It is impossible to foretell what measures may\r\nbecome necessary under given circumstances. No Government, no Minister,\r\nbe he ever so powerful, can foresee what circumstances may require in\r\nthe next few years. All the less is it possible to foretell measures,\r\nthat will be influenced by circumstance, which elude all accurate\r\ncalculation. The question of \"measures\" is a question of tactics in\r\nbattle. These depend upon the enemy and upon the means at his disposal,\r\nand at mine. A measure that would be excellent to-day, may be harmful\r\nto-morrow, the circumstances that yesterday justified its application\r\nhaving changed to-day. With the goal in view, the means to attain it by\r\ndepend upon time and tide; imperative is but the seizing of the most\r\neffective and thorough going ones that time and tide may allow. In\r\nforecasting the future, hypotheses alone are available: things must be\r\nsupposed to exist that have not yet set in.\r\n\r\n_Accordingly, we suppose the arrival of a day when all the evils\r\ndescribed will have reached such maturity that they will have become\r\noppressingly sensible to the feeling as to the sight of the vast\r\nmajority, to the extent of being no longer bearable; whereupon a general\r\nirresistible desire for a radical change will seize society, and then\r\nthe quickest will be regarded the most effective remedy._\r\n\r\nAll social evils, without exception, have their source in that social\r\norder of things, which, as has been shown, rests upon capitalism, upon\r\nthe capitalist system of production. Under this system, the capitalist\r\nclass is the possessor of all instruments of labor--land, mines,\r\nquarries, raw material, tools, machines, means of transportation and\r\ncommunication--and it exploits and oppresses the vast majority of the\r\npeople. The result of such abuses is an increased precariousness of\r\nlivelihood, increased misery, oppression and degradation of the\r\nexploited classes. It is, consequently, necessary to convert this\r\ncapitalist property into social property by means of a general\r\nexpropriation. _Production for sale must be converted into socialist\r\nproduction, conducted for and by Society. Production on a large scale,\r\nand the increasing fertility of social labor,--until now a source of\r\nmisery and of oppression for the exploited classes--must be turned into\r\na source of highest well-being and of full and harmonious culture._\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[160] Let also one American instance be cited. It occurred on April 1,\r\n1894, in Dolgeville, N. Y., where an employe of the \"profit-sharing\"\r\nconcern of Alfred Dolge--at whose annual dinners Professor, now\r\nPresident George Gunton was regularly a star guest, and orator to the\r\n\"dined\" workingmen on the beauties of \"profit-sharing,\"--one of the\r\nworkingmen, driven by the pinching poverty and incertitude inflicted\r\nupon him by the \"profit-sharing\" practice, killed his wife, four\r\nchildren and himself, and left a letter describing his plight. (See \"The\r\nPeople,\" April 8, 1894)--THE TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n[161] As early as the days of Plato were the consequences of such\r\nconditions understood. He writes: \"A nation in which classes exist, is\r\nnot one, but two: one class is made up of the poor, the other of the\r\nrich, both living together, yet on the watch against each other.... In\r\nthe end, the ruling class is unable to conduct a war, because it would\r\nthen have to avail itself of the masses, whom, armed, it fears more than\r\nthe enemy himself\"; Plato, \"The Republic.\" Aristotle says: \"Widespread\r\npoverty is an evil, inasmuch as it is hardly possible to prevent such\r\npeople from becoming inciters of sedition\"; Aristotle, \"Politics.\"\r\n\r\n[162] \"Natuerliche Schoepfungsgeschichte.\"\r\n\r\n[163] Similarly Plato in \"The Republic\": \"Crimes have their roots in\r\nwant of culture, in bad education and bad social institutions.\"\r\nEvidently, Plato understood the nature of society better than one of his\r\nlearned successors twenty-three hundred years later,--not a cheering\r\ncontemplation.\r\n\r\n[164] In the sense of German industrial statistics, every employer is\r\nplaced under the head of \"small producer\" who employs less than five\r\npersons.\r\n\r\n[165] Clemens Heiss: \"Die grossen Einkommen in Deutschland.\"\r\n\r\n[166] Clemens Heiss, _ubi supra._\r\n\r\n[167] Clemens Heiss: \"Die grossen Einkommen in Deutschland.\"\r\n\r\n[168] According to the census of 1900, the capital invested in industry\r\nwas 9,831 million dollars,--an increase over 1890 of 3,307 million; and\r\nthe value of the industrial products was 13,010 million dollars,--an\r\nincrease over 1890 of 3,640 millions.--THE TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n[169] Professor Adolf Wagner expresses the same thought in his first\r\nrevised edition of Raus' \"Lehrbuch der politischen Oekonomie.\" He says,\r\np. 361: \"The social question is the consciousness gained by the people\r\nof the contradiction between the economic development and the social\r\nprinciple of freedom and equality, that hovers over their minds as the\r\nideal, and is realized in political life.\"\r\n\r\n[170] Dr. E. Sax says in his work \"Die Hausindustrie in Thüringen,\"\r\namong other things, that in 1869 the production of 244¼ million slate\r\npencils had given from 122,000 to 200,000 gilders in wages to the labor,\r\nbut the final price paid by the consumer rose to 1,200,000 gilders; it\r\nwas, accordingly, at least six times as much as the producer received.\r\nIn the summer of 1888, there were 5 marks paid at first hand for 5\r\nhundredweights of shellfish; the retailer paid the wholesale dealer 15\r\nmarks; and the public paid 125 marks. Moreover, large quantities of\r\nfoodstuffs are destroyed because the prices will not pay for\r\ntransportation. For instance, in years of great herring draughts, whole\r\nboatloads are turned to manure, while inland there are hundreds of\r\nthousands of people who can buy no herrings. It was likewise in 1892\r\nwith the large potato crops in California. And yet sense is claimed for\r\nsuch a state of things.\r\n\r\n[171] The industrial census of June 5, 1882, gives Germany 386,157 large\r\nand 154,474 small stores, a total of 531,631.

The conditions of\r\nlife and labor--in manufacture, agriculture, transportation and\r\ncommunication, education, marriage, science, art and intercourse--are\r\nradically changed for both sexes. Human existence acquires a new sense.\r\nThe present political organization gradually loses ground: the State\r\nvanishes: in a measure it abolishes itself.\r\n\r\nIt was shown in the first part of this book why the State arose. It\r\narises, as the product of a social growth, from a primitive form of\r\nsociety, that rested on communism and that dissolved in the measure that\r\n_private property_ developed. With the rise of private property,\r\nantagonistic interests take shape within society; in the course of its\r\ndevelopment these antagonisms lead to rank and class contrasts, and\r\nthese, in turn, grow into enmities between the several groups of\r\ninterests, and finally into rank and class struggles, that threaten the\r\nexistence of the new social order. In order to keep down these rank and\r\nclass struggles, and to protect the property-holders, an organization is\r\nrequisite that parries the assaults on property, and that pronounces\r\n\"legal and sacred\" the property obtained under certain forms. _This\r\norganization and power, that guards and upholds property, is the State._\r\nThrough the enactment of laws it secures the owner in his ownership, and\r\nit steps as judge and avenger before him who assails the established\r\norder. By reason of its innermost being, the interest of a ruling\r\nproperty class, and of the Government therewith connected, is ever\r\nconservative. The organization of the State changes only when the\r\ninterest of property so demands. The State is, accordingly, the\r\n_inevitably necessary_ organization of a social order that rests upon\r\nclass rule. The moment class antagonisms fall through the abolition of\r\nprivate property, the State loses both the _necessity_ and the\r\n_possibility_ for its existence. With the removal of the conditions for\r\nrulership, the State gradually ceases to be, the same as creeds wane\r\nwhen the belief ceases in supernatural beings, or in transcendental\r\npowers gifted with reason. Words must have sense; if they lose that they\r\ncease to convey ideas.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" interjects at this point a capitalist-minded reader, \"that is all\r\nvery well, but by what 'legal principle' can society justify such a\r\nchange?\" The legal principle is the same that ever prevailed, whenever\r\nit was the question of changes and reforms,--_public policy_. Not the\r\nState, but society is the source of right; the State is but the\r\ncommittee of Society, authorized to administer and dispense right.\r\nHitherto, \"Society\" has been a small minority; yet it acted in the name\r\nof the whole community (the people) by pronouncing itself \"Society,\"\r\nmuch as Louis XIV. pronounced himself the \"State,\"--\"_L'état c'est moi_\"\r\n(I am the State). When our newspapers announce: \"The season begins;\r\nsociety is returning to the city,\" or \"The season has closed; society is\r\nrushing to the country,\" they never mean the people, but only the upper\r\nten thousand, who constitute \"Society\" as they constitute the \"State.\"\r\nThe masses are \"plebs,\" \"vile multitude,\" \"canaille,\" \"people.\" In\r\nkeeping therewith, all that the State has done in the name of Society\r\nfor the \"public weal\" has always been to the advantage and profit of the\r\nruling class. It is in its interests that laws are framed. \"_Salus\r\nreipublicae suprema lex esto_\" (Let the public weal be the supreme law)\r\nis a well known legal principle of Old Rome. But who constituted the\r\nRoman Commonwealth? Did it consist of the subjugated peoples, the\r\nmillions of slaves? No. A disproportionately small number of Roman\r\ncitizens, foremost among these the Roman nobility, all of whom were\r\nsupported by the subject class.\r\n\r\nWhen, in the Middle Ages, noblemen and Princes stole the common\r\nproperty, they did so \"according to law,\" in the \"interest of the public\r\nweal,\" and how drastically the common property and that of the helpless\r\npeasants was treated on the occasion we have sufficiently explained. The\r\nagrarian history of the last fifteen centuries is a narration of\r\nuninterrupted robbery perpetrated upon common and peasant property by\r\nthe nobility and the Church in all the leading countries of Europe. When\r\nthe French Revolution expropriated the estates of the nobility and the\r\nChurch, it did so \"in the name of the public weal\"; and a large part of\r\nthe seven million of landed estates, that are to-day the prop of modern\r\nbourgeois France, owe their existence to this expropriation. \"In the\r\nname of the public weal,\" Spain more than once embargoed Church\r\nproperty, and Italy wholly confiscated the same,--both with the plaudits\r\nof the zealous defenders of \"sacred property.\" The English nobility has\r\nfor centuries been robbing the Irish and English people of their\r\nproperty, and, during the period of 1804-1832 made itself a present of\r\nnot less than 3,511,710 acres of commons \"in the interest of the public\r\nwelfare.\" When during the great North American war for the emancipation\r\nof the negro, millions of slaves, the regular property of their masters,\r\nwere declared free without indemnity to the latter, the thing was done\r\n\"in the name of the public weal.\" Our whole capitalist development is an\r\nuninterrupted process of expropriation and confiscation, at which the\r\nmanufacturer expropriates the workingman, the large landlord\r\nexpropriates the peasant, the large merchant expropriates the small\r\ndealer, and finally one capitalist expropriates another, i. e., the\r\nlarger expropriates and absorbs the smaller. To hear our bourgeoisie,\r\nall this happens in the interest of the \"public weal,\" for the \"good of\r\nsociety.\" The Napoleonites \"saved Society\" on the 18th Brumaire and 2d\r\nof December, and \"Society\" congratulated them. If hereafter Society\r\nshall save itself by resuming possession of the property that itself has\r\nproduced, it will enact the most notable historic event--_it is not\r\nseeking to oppress some in the interest of others, but to afford to all\r\nthe prerequisite for equality of existence, to make possible to each an\r\nexistence worthy of human beings_. It will be morally the cleanest and\r\nmost stupendous measure that human society has ever executed.\r\n\r\nIn what manner this gigantic process of social expropriation will be\r\nachieved, and under what modality, eludes all surmise. Who can tell how\r\ngeneral conditions will then be, and what the demands of public interest\r\nwill be?\r\n\r\nIn his fourth social letter to v. Kirchmann, entitled \"Capital,\"\r\nRodbertus says: \"The dissolution of all capitalist property in land is\r\nno chimera; on the contrary, it is easily conceivable in national\r\neconomy. It would, moreover, be the most radical aid to society, that,\r\nas might be put in a few words, is suffering of rent-rising--rent of\r\nland and capital. Hence the measure would be the only manner of\r\nabolishing property in land and capital, _a measure that would not even\r\nfor a moment interrupt the commerce and progress of the nation_.\" What\r\nsay our agrarians to this opinion of their former political\r\nco-religionist?\r\n\r\nIn the contemplation of how matters will probably shape themselves along\r\nthe principal lines of human activity, upon such a measure of general\r\nexpropriation, there can be no question of establishing hard and fast\r\nlines, or rigid institutions. No one is able to forecast the detailed\r\nmolds in which future generations may cast their social organizations,\r\nand how they will satisfy their wants. In Society as in Nature,\r\neverything is in constant flux and reflux; one thing rises, another\r\nwanes; what is old and sered is replaced with new and living forms.\r\nInventions, discoveries and improvements, numerous and various, the\r\nbearing and significance of which often none can tell, are made from day\r\nto day, come into operation, and, each in its own way, they\r\nrevolutionize and transform human life and all society.\r\n\r\nWe can, accordingly, be concerned only with general principles, that\r\nflow inevitably from the preceding _expose_, and whose enforcement may\r\nbe supervised, up to a certain point. If even hitherto society has been\r\nno automatic entity, leadable and guidable by an individual, much as\r\nappearances often pointed the other way; if even hitherto those who\r\nimagined they pushed were themselves pushed; if even hitherto society\r\nwas an organism, that developed according to certain inherent laws;--if\r\nthat was hitherto the case, in the future all guiding and leading after\r\nindividual caprice is all the more out of question. Society will have\r\ndiscovered the secret of its own being, it will have discovered the laws\r\nof its own progress, and it will apply these consciously towards its own\r\nfurther development.\r\n\r\nSo soon as society is in possession of all the means of production, _the\r\nduty to work, on the part of all able to work, without distinction of\r\nsex, becomes the organic law of socialized society_. Without work\r\nsociety can not exist. Hence, society has the right to demand that all,\r\nwho wish to satisfy their wants, shall exert themselves, according to\r\ntheir physical and mental faculties, in the production of the requisite\r\nwealth. The silly claim that the Socialist does not wish to work, that\r\nhe seeks to abolish work, is a matchless absurdity, which fits our\r\nadversaries alone. Non-workers, idlers, exist in capitalist society\r\n_only_. Socialism agrees with the Bible that \"He who will not work,\r\nneither shall he eat.\" But work shall not be mere activity; it shall be\r\nuseful, productive activity. The new social system will demand that each\r\nand all pursue some industrial, agricultural or other useful occupation,\r\nwhereby to furnish a certain amount of work towards the satisfaction of\r\nexisting wants. _Without work no pleasure, no pleasure without work._\r\n\r\nAll being obliged to work, all have an equal interest in seeing the\r\nfollowing three conditions of work in force:--\r\n\r\nFirst, that work shall be moderate, and shall overtax none;\r\n\r\nSecond, that work shall be as agreeable and varied as possible;\r\n\r\nThird, that work shall be as productive as possible, seeing that both\r\nthe hours of work and fruition hinge upon that.\r\n\r\nThese three conditions hinge, in turn, upon the nature and the number of\r\nthe productive powers that are available, and also upon the aspirations\r\nof society. But Socialist society does not come into existence for the\r\npurpose of living in proletarian style; _it comes into existence in\r\norder to abolish the proletarian style of life of the large majority of\r\nhumanity_. It seeks to afford to each and all the fullest possible\r\nmeasure of the amenities of life. The question that does rise is, How\r\nhigh will the aspirations of society mount?\r\n\r\nIn order to determine this, an administration is requisite that shall\r\nembrace all the fields of social activity. Our municipalities constitute\r\nan effective basis thereto: if they are too large to allow a ready\r\nsupervision, they can be divided into wards. As in primitive society,\r\nall members of the community who are of age participate in the\r\nelections, _without distinction of sex_, and have a voice in the choice\r\nof the persons who are to be entrusted with the administration. At the\r\nhead of all the local administrations stands the central\r\nadministration--as will be noted, not a Government, with power to rule,\r\nbut an executive college of administrative functions. Whether the\r\ncentral administration shall be chosen directly by popular vote or\r\nappointed by the local administration is immaterial. These questions\r\nwill not then have the importance they have to-day: the question is then\r\nno longer one of filling posts that bestow special honor, or that vest\r\nthe incumbent with greater power and influence, or that yield larger\r\nincomes: it is then a question of filling positions of trust, for which\r\nthe fittest, whether male or female, are taken; and these may be\r\nrecalled or re-elected as circumstances may demand, or the electors may\r\ndeem preferable. All posts are for given terms. The incumbents are,\r\naccordingly, clothed with no special \"official qualities\"; the feature\r\nof continuity of office is absent, likewise a hierarchical order of\r\npromotion. Hence it is also immaterial to us whether there shall be\r\nmiddle stages, say provincial administrations, between the central and\r\nthe local administrations. If they are deemed necessary, they are set\r\nup; if they are not deemed necessary, they are left alone. All such\r\nmatters are decided by actual exigencies, as ascertained in practice. If\r\nthe progress of society has rendered any old organization superfluous,\r\nit is abolished without further ado and dispute, there being no longer\r\nany personal interest in conflict; and new ones are similarly\r\nestablished. Obviously, _such an administration, resting upon the\r\nbroadest democratic foundation, differs radically from what we have\r\nto-day_. What a battle of newspapers, what a war of tongues in our\r\nparliaments, what mountains of public documents in our bureaus, if but a\r\ntrivial change is made in the administration or the Government!\r\n\r\nThe principal thing to ascertain is the number and the nature of the\r\nforces that are available, the quantity and nature of the means of\r\nproduction,--the factories, workshops, means of transportation and\r\ncommunication, land--and also their productivity. The next thing to\r\nascertain is the quantity of the supplies that are on hand and the\r\nextent to which these can satisfy the wants of society. As to-day the\r\nState and the several municipalities yearly cast up their budgets, the\r\nthing will then be done with an eye to all the wants of society, without\r\nthereby excluding changes that increased or new wants may demand.\r\nStatistics here play the chief _role_: they become the most important\r\nsubsidiary science of the new order: they furnish the measure for all\r\nsocial activities.\r\n\r\nStatistics are extensively used to-day for similar purposes. The\r\nImperial, State and municipal budgets are based upon a large amount of\r\nstatistical reports, made yearly by the several administrative branches.\r\nLong experience and a certain degree of stability in the running wants\r\nfacilitate their gathering. Every operator of a large factory, every\r\nmerchant is, under normal conditions, able to determine accurately what\r\nhe will need during the next three months, and how he should regulate\r\nhis production and purchases. Unless excessive changes set in, his\r\ncalculations will be found safe.\r\n\r\nThe experience that crises are caused by blind, anarchic production, i.\r\ne., that production is carried on without a knowledge of the volume of\r\nsupply, of sales and of demand of and for the several goods in the\r\nworld's market, has, as indicated in previous passages, caused large\r\nmanufacturers in several branches of industry to join in Trusts and\r\nrings, partly with the view of steadying prices, partly also for the\r\npurpose of regulating production by the light of previous experience and\r\nof the orders received. According to the capability of each\r\nestablishment and to the probable demand, the output of each is\r\ndetermined for the next few months. Infractions are punished with heavy\r\nconventional mulcts, and even expulsion. The capitalists do not conclude\r\nthese agreements for the benefit of the public, but to its injury and to\r\ntheir own profit. Their purpose is to utilize the power of combination\r\nin order to secure the greatest advantages to themselves. This\r\nregulation of production has for its object to enable the capitalist to\r\ndemand from the public prices that could not be got if the competitive\r\nstruggle was on between the several capitalists. These enrich themselves\r\nat the expense of the consumers who are forced to pay whatever price is\r\ndemanded for the goods they need. As the consumer, so is the workingman\r\ninjured by the Trusts. The artificial regulation of production throws a\r\npart of the working class out of work, and, in order that these may\r\nlive, they underbid their fellows at work. Thus the employer derives a\r\ndouble advantage: he receives higher prices, and he pays lower wages.\r\nSuch a regulation of production by combinations of capitalists _is\r\nexactly the reverse of that which will be practiced in Socialist\r\nsociety_. While to-day the interests of the capitalists is the\r\ndetermining factor, the interests of all will then be the guide.\r\nProduction will then be carried on for the satisfaction of human wants,\r\nand not in order to obtain, through high prices, large profits for\r\nprivate individuals. Nevertheless, the best planned combination in\r\ncapitalist society can not take in and control all the factors needed in\r\nthe calculation: competition and speculation run wild despite all\r\ncombinations: finally the discovery is made that the calculation had a\r\nleak, and the scheme breaks down.\r\n\r\nThe same as production on a large scale, commerce also has extensive\r\nstatistics. Every week the larger centers of commerce and the ports\r\npublish reports on the supply of petroleum, coffee, cotton, sugar,\r\ngrain, etc. These statistics are frequently inaccurate, seeing that the\r\nowners of the goods frequently have a personal interest in concealing\r\nthe truth. On the whole, however, the statistics are pretty safe and\r\nfurnish to those interested, information on the condition of the\r\nmarket. But here also speculation steps in, upsets all calculations, and\r\noften renders all legitimate business impossible. Seeing how impossible\r\nis a general regulation of production in capitalist society, due to the\r\nexistence of many thousands of private producers with conflicting\r\ninterests, it will be obvious why the speculative nature of commerce,\r\nthe number of merchants and their conflicting interests render equally\r\nimpossible the regulation of distribution. Nevertheless, what is done in\r\nthese directions indicates what could be done so soon as private\r\ninterest were to drop out and the interests of all were alone dominant.\r\nA proof of this is furnished by the statistics of crops, that are yearly\r\nissued by the leading countries of civilization, and that enable certain\r\ngeneral conclusions to be drawn upon the size of the crops, the extent\r\nthat they will supply the demand, and the probable price.\r\n\r\nIn a socialized society matters are fully regulated; society is held in\r\nfraternal bonds. Everything is done in order; there, it is an easy\r\nmatter to gauge demand. With a little experience, the thing is easy as\r\nplay. If, for instance, the demand is statistically established for\r\nbread, meat, shoes, linen, etc., and, on the other hand, the\r\nproductivity of the respective plants is equally known, _the average\r\ndaily amount of socially necessary labor is thereby ascertained. The\r\nfigures would, furthermore, point out where more plants for the\r\nproduction of a certain article may be needed, or where such may be\r\ndiscontinued as superfluous, or turned to other purposes._\r\n\r\nEveryone decides the pursuit he chooses: the large number of different\r\nfields of activity caters to the tastes of all. If on one field there is\r\na surplus and on another a dearth of labor-power, the administration\r\nattends to the equalization of forces. To organize production, and to\r\nfurnish the several powers with the opportunity to apply themselves at\r\nthe right places will be the principal task of these functionaries. In\r\nthe measure that the several forces are broken in, the wheels will move\r\nwith greater smoothness. The several branches and divisions of labor\r\nchoose their foremen, who superintend the work. These are no\r\nslave-drivers, like most foremen of to-day; they are fellow workers,\r\nwho, instead of a productive, exercise an administrative function\r\nentrusted to them. The idea is by no means excluded that, with the\r\nattainment of higher perfection, both in point of organization and of\r\nindividuals, these functions should alternate so that, within a certain\r\ntime, and in certain order, they are filled by all _regardless of sex_.\r\n\r\nA system of labor, organized upon a plan of such absolute liberty and\r\ndemocratic equality, where each stands for all, and all stand for each,\r\nand where the sense of solidarity reigns supreme,--such a system would\r\ngenerate a spirit of industry and of emulation nowhere to be found in\r\nthe modern economic system. Nor could such a spirit of industry fail to\r\nreact both upon the productivity of labor and the quality of labor's\r\nproduct.\r\n\r\nFurthermore--seeing that all are mutually active--the interest becomes\r\ngeneral in the best and most complete, as well as in the quickest\r\npossible production of goods, with the object of saving labor, and of\r\ngaining time for the production of further wealth, looking to the\r\ngratification of higher wants. _Such a common interest spurs all to bend\r\ntheir thoughts towards simplifying and quickening the process of labor.\r\nThe ambition to invent and discover is stimulated to the highest pitch:\r\neach will seek to outdo the other in propositions and ideas._[176]\r\n\r\nJust the reverse will, accordingly, happen of which the adversaries of\r\nSocialism claim. How many are not the inventors and discoverers who go\r\nto pieces in the capitalist world! How many has it not exploited and\r\nthen cast aside! If talent and intellect, instead of property, stood at\r\nthe head of bourgeois society, _the larger part of the employers would\r\nhave to make room for their workingmen, master mechanics, technical\r\noverseers, engineers, chemists, etc._ These are the men, who, in\r\nninety-nine cases out of a hundred, make the inventions, discoveries and\r\nimprovements, which the man with the money-bag exploits. How many\r\nthousands of discoverers and inventors have gone to pieces unable to\r\nfind the man of means ready to provide the wherewithal for the execution\r\nof their thoughts; how many germs of inventions and discoveries have\r\nbeen and continue to be nipped by the social stress for bare existence,\r\nis a matter that eludes all calculation. Not the men of head and brain,\r\nbut those of large wealth are to-day the masters of the world,--which,\r\nhowever, does not exclude the occasional and exceptional phenomenon of\r\nbrains and wealth being united in one person. The exception only proves\r\nthe rule.\r\n\r\nEveryone in practical life knows with what suspicion the workingman\r\nto-day regards every improvement, every invention introduced in the\r\nshop. And he is right. He rarely derives any advantage therefrom; it all\r\naccrues to the employer. The workingman is assailed with the fear lest\r\nthe new machine, the new improvement cast him off to-morrow as\r\nsuperfluous. Instead of gladsome applause for an invention that does\r\nhonor to man and is fraught with benefit for the race, he only has a\r\nmalediction on his lips. We also know, from personal experience, how\r\nmany an improvement perceived by the workingman, is not introduced: the\r\nworkingman keeps silent, fearing to derive no benefit but only harm from\r\nit. Such are the natural consequences of an antagonism of\r\ninterests.[177]\r\n\r\nThis antagonism of interests is removed in Socialist society. Each\r\nunfolds his faculties in his own interest, and, by so doing,\r\nsimultaneously benefits the commonweal. To-day personal gratification is\r\ngenerally antagonistic to the common weal; the two exclude each other.\r\nIn the new Order, the antagonisms are removed: _The gratification of the\r\nego and the promotion of the common weal harmonize, they supplement each\r\nother._[178]\r\n\r\nThe marvelous effect of such a mental and moral condition is obvious.\r\nThe productivity of labor will rise mightily, and such increased\r\nproductivity makes possible the satisfaction of higher wants. Especially\r\nwill the productivity of labor rise through the discontinuance of the\r\npresent and enormous disintegration of labor, in hundreds of thousands,\r\neven millions of petty establishments, conducted with imperfect tools.\r\nAccording to the industrial census of the German Empire for the year\r\n1882, there were 3,005,457 leading establishments, exclusive of\r\ncommerce, transportation, hotels and inns, in which 6,396,465 persons\r\nwere occupied. Of these leading establishments, 61.1 per cent. employed\r\nless than 5 persons, and 16.8 per cent. employed from 6 to 50 persons.\r\nThe former are small concerns, the latter middle class ones. Through the\r\nconcentration of the small and middle class establishments into large\r\nones, equipped with all the advantages of modern technique, an enormous\r\nwaste in power, time, material (light, heat, etc.) space, now incurred,\r\nwould be avoided, and the productivity of labor would gain\r\nproportionally. What difference there is in the productivity of small,\r\nmiddle class and large establishments, even where modern technique is\r\napplied, may be illustrated by the census of manufactories of the State\r\nof Massachusetts for 1890. The establishments in ten leading industries\r\nwere divided into three classes. Those that produced less than $40,000\r\nworth of goods were placed in the lowest class; those that produced from\r\n$40,000 to $150,000 were placed in the middle class; and those that\r\nproduced over $150,000 worth of goods were placed in the upper class.\r\n\r\nThe result was this:--\r\n\r\n\r\n               Number of        Percentage    Productivity Percentage\r\n               Establishments.    of All          of        of Total\r\n    Classes.                  Establishments.  Each Class. Productivity.\r\n  Lower        2,042                55.2        51,660,617       9.4\r\n  Middle         968                26.2       106,868,635      19.5\r\n  Upper          686                18.6       390,817,300      71.1\r\n               -----               -----       -----------     -----\r\n               3,696               100.0       549,346,552     100.0\r\n\r\n\r\nThe more than twice as large number of small establishments turned out\r\nonly 9.4 per cent. of the total product. But even the large\r\nestablishments could, with hardly any exception, be conducted far more\r\nrationally than now, so that, under a system of collective production,\r\naided by the most highly perfected technical process, an infinitely\r\nlarger demand could be supplied.\r\n\r\nUpon the subject of the saving of time, possible under a system of\r\nproduction planted on a rational basis, Th. Hertzka of Vienna has made\r\nsome interesting calculations.[179] He investigated the amount of\r\nlabor-power and time requisite for the satisfaction of the wants of the\r\n22 million inhabitants of Austria by means of production on a large\r\nscale. To this end Hertzka gathered information upon the capacity of\r\nlarge establishments in several fields, and he based his calculations\r\nupon the data thus ascertained. In Hertzka's calculation are included\r\n10,500,000 hectares of agricultural and 3,000,000 hectares of pasture\r\nlands, that should suffice for the production of agricultural products\r\nand of meat for the said population. Hertzka also included in his\r\ncomputation the building of houses on the basis of a house of 150 square\r\nmeters, 5 rooms and strong enough to last 50 years, to each family. The\r\nresult was that, for agricultural, building, the production of flour,\r\nsugar, coal, iron, machinery, clothing and chemicals, only 615,000\r\nworkingmen were needed, at work the whole year and at the present\r\naverage hours of daily labor. These 615,000 workingmen are, however,\r\n_only 12.3 per cent. of the population of Austria, capable to work,\r\nexclusive of all the women as well as the males under 16 and over 50\r\nyears of age_. If all the 5,000,000 men, and not merely the above figure\r\nof 615,000, were engaged, then, _each of them would need to work only\r\n36.9 days--six weeks in round figures_--in order to produce the\r\nnecessaries of life for 22 million people. Assuming 300 work days in the\r\nyear, instead of 37, and 11 as the present daily hours of work, it\r\nfollows that, under this new organization of labor, _only 1-3/8 hours a\r\nday would be needed to cover the most pressing needs of all_.\r\n\r\nHertzka further computes the articles of luxury that the better situated\r\ndemand, and he finds that the production of the same for 22 million\r\npeople would require an additional 315,000 workingmen. Altogether,\r\naccording to Hertzka, and making allowance for some industries that are\r\nnot properly represented in Austria, one million in round figures, equal\r\nto 20 per cent. of the male population able to work, exclusive of those\r\nunder 16 and above 50 years of age, would suffice to cover _all the\r\nneeds of the population_ in 60 days. If, again, the whole male\r\npopulation able to work is made the basis of the computation, these\r\nwould need to furnish but _two and a half hours work a day_.[180]\r\n\r\nThis computation will surprise none who take a comprehensive view of\r\nthings. Considering, then, that, at such moderate hours, even the men 50\r\nyears old--all the sick and invalid excepted--are able to work;\r\nfurthermore, that also youths under 16 years of age could be partially\r\nactive, as well as a large number of women, in so far as these are not\r\notherwise engaged in the education of children, the preparation of food,\r\netc.;--considering all that, it follows that even these hours could be\r\nconsiderably lowered, or the demand for wealth could be considerably\r\nincreased. None will venture to claim that no more and unforeseen\r\nprogress, and considerable progress, at that, is possible in the\r\nprocess of production, thus furnishing still greater advantages. But\r\nthe issue now is to satisfy a mass of wants felt by all that to-day are\r\nsatisfied only by a minority. With higher culture ever newer wants\r\narise, and these too should be met. We repeat it: _the new Social order\r\nis not to live in proletarian style; it lives as a highly developed\r\npeople demand to live, and it makes the demand in all its members from\r\nthe first to the last_. But such a people can not rest content with\r\nsatisfying merely its material wants. All its members are to be allowed\r\nfullest leisure for their development in the arts and sciences, as well\r\nas for their recreation.\r\n\r\nAlso in other important respects will Socialist society differ from the\r\nbourgeois individualist system. The motto: \"Cheap and bad\"--which is and\r\nmust be standard for a large portion of bourgeois production, seeing\r\nthat the larger part of the customers can buy only cheap goods, that\r\nquickly wear out--likewise drops out. Only the best will be produced; it\r\nwill last longer and will need replacing at only wider intervals. The\r\nfollies and insanities of fashion, promoted by wastefulness and\r\ntastelessness, also cease. People will probably clothe themselves more\r\nproperly and sightfully than to-day, when, be it said in passing, the\r\nfashions of the last hundred years, especially as to men, distinguish\r\nthemselves by their utter tastelessness. No longer will a new fashion be\r\nintroduced every three months, an act of folly that stands in intimate\r\nrelation with the competitive struggle of women among themselves, with\r\nthe ostentatiousness and vanity of society, and with the necessity for\r\nthe display of wealth. To-day a mass of establishments and people live\r\nupon this folly of fashion, and are compelled by their own interests to\r\nstimulate and force it. Together with the folly of fashion in dress,\r\nfalls the folly of fashion in the style of architecture. Eccentricity\r\nreaches here its worst expression. Styles of architecture that required\r\ncenturies for their development and that sprang up among different\r\npeoples--we are no longer satisfied with European styles, we go to the\r\nJapanese, Indians and Chinese--are used up in a few decades and laid\r\naside. Our poor professional artists no longer know whither and whereto\r\nthey should turn with and for their samples and models. Hardly have they\r\nassorted themselves with one style, and expect to recover with ease the\r\noutlays they have made, when a new style breaks in upon them, and\r\ndemands new sacrifices of time and money, of mental and physical powers.\r\nThe nervousness of the age is best reflected in the rush from one\r\nfashion to the other, from one style to the other. No one will dare to\r\nclaim any sense for such hurrying and scurrying, or the merit of its\r\nbeing a symptom of social health.\r\n\r\n_Socialism alone will re-introduce a greater stability in the habits of\r\nlife._ It will make repose and enjoyment possible; it will be a\r\nliberator from hurry and excessive exertion. Nervousness, that scourge\r\nof our age, will disappear.\r\n\r\nBut labor is also to be made pleasant. To that end practical and\r\ntastefully contrived workshops are required; the utmost precautions\r\nagainst danger; the removal of disagreeable odors, gases and smoke,--in\r\nshort, of all sources of injury or discomfort to health. At the start,\r\nthe new social system will carry on production with the old means,\r\ninherited from the old. But these are utterly inadequate. Numerous and\r\nunsuitable workshops, disintegrated in all directions; imperfect tools\r\nand machinery, running through all the stages of usefulness;--this heap\r\nis insufficient both for the number of the workers and for their demands\r\nof comfort and of pleasure. The establishment of a large number of\r\nspacious, light, airy, fully equipped and ornamented workshops is a\r\npressing need. Art, technique, skill of head and hand immediately find a\r\nwide field of activity. All departments in the building of machinery, in\r\nthe fashioning of tools, in architecture and in the branches of work\r\nconnected with the internal equipment of houses have the amplest\r\nopportunity. Whatever human genius can invent with regard to comfortable\r\nand pleasant homes, proper ventilation, lighting and heating, mechanical\r\nand technical provisions and cleanliness is brought into application.\r\nThe saving of motor power, heating, lighting, time, as well as the\r\npromotion of all that tends to render work and life agreeable, demand a\r\nsuitable concentration of the fields of labor on certain spots.\r\nHabitations are separated from places of work and are freed from the\r\ndisagreeable features of industrial and other manual work. These\r\ndisagreeable features are, in their turn, reduced to the lowest measure\r\npossible by means of suitable arrangements and provisions of all sorts,\r\nuntil wholly removed. The present state of technique has now means\r\nenough at command to wholly free from danger the most dangerous\r\noccupations, such as mining and the preparation of chemicals, etc. But\r\nthese means can not be applied in capitalist society because they are\r\nexpensive, and there is no obligation to do more than what is absolutely\r\nnecessary for the workingman. The discomforts attached to mining can be\r\nremoved by means of a different sort of draining, of extensive\r\nventilation, of electric lighting, of a material reduction of hours of\r\nwork, and of frequent shifts. Nor does it require any particular\r\ncleverness to find such protective means as would render building\r\naccidents almost impossible, and transform work in that line into the\r\nmost exhilarating of all. Ample protections against sun and rain are\r\npossible in the construction of the largest edifices. Furthermore, in a\r\nsociety with ample labor-power at its disposal, such as Socialist\r\nsociety would be, frequent shifts and the concentration of certain work\r\nupon certain seasons of the year and certain hours of day would be an\r\neasy matter.\r\n\r\nThe problem of removing dust, smoke, soot and odors could likewise be\r\ncompletely solved by modern chemistry and technique; it is solved only\r\npartially or not at all, simply because the private employers care not\r\nto make the necessary sacrifice of funds. The work-places of the future,\r\nwherever located, whether above or under ground, will, accordingly,\r\ndistinguish themselves most favorably from those of to-day. Many\r\ncontrivances are, under the existing system of private enterprise, first\r\nof all, a question of money: can the business bear the expenditure? Will\r\nit pay? If the answer is in the negative, then let the workingmen go to\r\npieces. Capital does not operate where there is no profit. Humanity is\r\nnot an \"issue\" on the Exchange.[181]\r\n\r\nThe question of \"profit\" has exhausted its _role_ in Socialist society:\r\n_in Socialist society the only consideration is the welfare of its\r\nmembers_. Whatever is beneficent to these and protects them must be\r\nintroduced; whatever injures them must stop. None is forced to join in a\r\ndangerous game. If matters are undertaken that have dangers in prospect,\r\nvolunteers will be numerous, all the more so seeing that the object can\r\nnever be to the injury, but only to the promotion of civilization.\r\n\r\nThe amplest application of motor powers and of the best machinery and\r\nimplements, the utmost subdivision of labor, and the most efficient\r\ncombinations of labor-power will, accordingly, carry production to such\r\npitch that the hours of work can be materially reduced in the production\r\nof the necessaries of life. The capitalist lengthens the hours of labor,\r\nwhenever he can, especially during crises, when the worker's power of\r\nresistance is broken, and by squeezing more surplus values out of him,\r\nprices may be lowered. In Socialist society, an increase of production\r\naccrues to the benefit of all: _The share of each rises with the\r\nproductivity of labor and increased productivity again makes possible\r\nthe reduction of the hours of work, socially determined as necessary._\r\n\r\nAmong the motor powers that are coming into application, electricity\r\nwill, according to all appearances, take a decisive place.[182]\r\nCapitalist society is now everywhere engaged in harnessing it to its\r\nservice. The more extensively this is done the better. The\r\nrevolutionizing effect of this mightiest of all the powers of Nature\r\nwill but all the sooner snap the bonds of bourgeois society, and open\r\nthe doors to Socialism. But only in Socialist society will electricity\r\nattain its fullest and most widespread application. If the prospects now\r\nopened for its application are even but partially realized--and on that\r\nhead there can be no doubt--electricity, as a motor power as well as a\r\nsource of light and heat, will contribute immeasurably towards the\r\nimprovement of the conditions of life. Electricity distinguishes itself\r\nfrom all other motor power in that, above all, its supply in Nature is\r\nabundant. Our water courses, the ebb and tide of the sea, the winds, the\r\nsun-light--all furnish innumerable horse-powers, the moment we know how\r\nto utilize them in full. Through the invention of accumulators it has\r\nbeen proved that large volumes of power, which can be appropriated only\r\nperiodically, from the ebbs and tides, the winds and mountain streams,\r\ncan be stored up and kept for use at any given place and any given time.\r\nAll these inventions and discoveries are still in embryo: their full\r\ndevelopment may be surmised, but can not be forecast in detail.\r\n\r\nThe progress expected from the application of electricity sounds like a\r\nfairy tale. Mr. Meems of Baltimore has planned an electric wagon able to\r\ntravel 300 kilometers an hour--actually race with the wind. Nor does Mr.\r\nMeems stand alone. Prof. Elihu Thomson of Lynn, Mass., also believes it\r\npossible to construct electromotors of a velocity of 160 kilometers,\r\nand, with suitable strengthening of the rolling stock and improvement of\r\nthe signal system, of a velocity of 260 kilometers; and he has given a\r\nplausible explanation of his system. The same scientist holds, and in\r\nthis Werner Siemens, who expressed similar views at the Berlin\r\nConvention of Naturalists in 1887, agrees with him, that it is possible\r\nby means of electricity _to transform the chemical elements directly\r\ninto food_--a revolution that would hoist capitalist society off its\r\nhinges. While in 1887 Werner Siemens was of the opinion that it was\r\npossible, though only in the remote future, to produce artificially a\r\nhydrate of carbon such as grape sugar and later the therewith closely\r\nrelated starch, whereby \"bread could be made out of stone,\" the chemist\r\nDr. B. Meyer claims that ligneous fibre could eventually be turned into\r\na source of human food. Obviously, we are moving towards ever newer\r\nchemical and technical revolutions. In the meantime, the physiologist E.\r\nEiseler has actually produced grape sugar artificially, and thus made a\r\ndiscovery that, in 1887, Werner Siemens considered possible only in the\r\n\"remote future.\" In the spring of 1894, the French ex-Minister of Public\r\nWorship, Prof. Berthelot, delivered an address in Paris at the banquet\r\nof the Association of Chemical Manufacturers upon the significance of\r\nchemistry in the future. The address is interesting in more respects\r\nthan one. Prof. Berthelot sketched the probable state of chemistry at\r\nabout the year 2000. While his sketch contains many a droll\r\nexaggeration, it does contain so much that is serious and sound that we\r\nshall present it in extract. After describing the achievements of\r\nchemistry during the last few decades, Prof. Berthelot went on to say:--\r\n\r\n\"The manufacture of sulphuric acids and of soda, bleaching and coloring,\r\nbeet sugar, therapeutic alkaloids, gas, gilding and silvering, etc.;\r\nthen came electro-chemistry, whereby metallurgy was radically\r\nrevolutionized; thermo-chemistry and the chemistry of explosives,\r\nwhereby fresh energy was imparted to mining and to war; the wonders of\r\norganic chemistry in the production of colors, of flavors, of\r\ntherapeutic and antiseptic means, etc. But all that is only a start:\r\nsoon much more important problems are to be solved. About the year 2000\r\nthere will be no more agriculture and no more farmers: chemistry will\r\nhave done away with the former cultivation of the soil. There will be no\r\nmore coal-shafts, consequently, neither will there be any more miners'\r\nstrikes. Fuel is produced by chemical and physical processes. Tariffs\r\nand wars are abolished: aerial navigation, that helped itself to\r\nchemicals as motor power, pronounced the sentence of death upon those\r\nobsolete habits. The whole problem of industry then consists in\r\ndiscovering sources of power, that are inexhaustible and resortable to\r\nwith little labor. Until now we have produced steam through the chemical\r\nenergy of burning mineral coal. But mineral coal is hard to get and its\r\nsupply decreases daily. Attention must be turned towards utilizing the\r\nheat of the sun and of the earth's crust. The hope is justified that\r\nboth sources will be drawn upon without limit. The boring of a shaft\r\n3,000 to 4,000 meters deep does not exceed the power of modern, less yet\r\nit will exceed that of future engineers. The source of all heat and of\r\nall industry would be thus thrown open. Add water to that, and all\r\nimaginable machinery may be put in perpetual operation on earth: the\r\nsource of this power would experience hardly any diminution in hundreds\r\nof years.\r\n\r\n\"With the aid of the earth's heat, numerous chemical problems will\r\nbecome solvable, among these the greatest of all--_the chemical\r\nproduction of food_. In principle, the problem is solved now. The\r\nsynthesis of fats and oils has been long known; likewise are sugar and\r\nhydrates of carbon known; nor will it be long before the secret of\r\ncompounding azote is out. The food problem is a purely chemical one.\r\nThe day when the corresponding cheap power shall have been obtained,\r\nfood of all sort will be producable with carbon out of carbon oxides,\r\nand with hydrogen and acids out of water, and with nitrogen out of the\r\natmosphere. What until now vegetation has done, industry will\r\nthenceforth perform, and more perfectly than Nature itself. The time\r\nwill come when everyone will carry about him a little box of chemicals\r\nwherewith to provide his food supply of albumen, fat and hydrates of\r\ncarbon, regardless of the hour of the day or the season of the year,\r\nregardless of rain or drought, of frost or hail, or insects. A\r\nrevolution will then set in of which no conception is so far possible.\r\nFields bearing fruit, wine-bearing mountain slopes and pastures for\r\ncattle will have vanished. Man will have gained in gentleness and\r\nmorality seeing he no longer lives on the murder and destruction of\r\nliving beings. Then also will the difference drop away between fertile\r\nand barren districts; perchance deserts may then become the favorite\r\nhomes of man being healthier than the damp valleys and the\r\nswamp-infected plains. Then also will Art, together with all the\r\nbeauties of human life reach full development. No longer will the face\r\nof earth be marred, so to speak, with geometrical figures, now entailed\r\nby agriculture: it will become a garden in which, at will, grass or\r\nflowers, bush or woods, can be allowed to grow, and in which the human\r\nrace will live in plenty, in a Golden Age. Nor will man thereby sink\r\ninto indolence and corruption. Work is requisite to happiness, and man\r\nwill work as much as ever, because he will be working for himself aiming\r\nat the highest development of his mental, moral and esthetical powers.\"\r\n\r\nEvery reader may accept what he please of this address of Prof.\r\nBerthelot; certain, however, is the prospect that in the future and in\r\nvirtue of the progress of science, wealth--the volume and variety of\r\nproducts--will increase enormously, and that the pleasures of life of\r\nthe coming generations will take undreamed of increment.\r\n\r\nAn aspiration, deeply implanted in the nature of man, is that of freedom\r\nin the choice and change of occupation. As uninterrupted repetition\r\nrenders the daintiest of dishes repulsive, so with a daily\r\ntreadmill-like recurring occupation: it dulls and relaxes the senses.\r\nMan then does only mechanically what he must do; he does it without\r\nswing or enjoyment. There are latent in all men faculties and desires\r\nthat need but to be awakened and developed to produce the most beautiful\r\nresults. Only then does man become fully and truly man. Towards the\r\nsatisfaction of this need of change, Socialist society offers, as will\r\nbe shown, the fullest opportunity. The mighty increase of productive\r\npowers, coupled with an ever progressing simplification of the process\r\nof labor, not only enables a considerable lowering of hours of work, it\r\nalso _facilitates the acquisition of skill in many directions_.\r\n\r\nThe old apprentice system has survived its usefulness: it exists to-day\r\nonly and is possible only in backward, old-fashioned forms of\r\nproduction, as represented by the small handicrafts. Seeing, however,\r\nthat this vanishes from the new social Order, all the institutions and\r\nforms peculiar thereto vanish along with it. New ones step in. Every\r\nfactory shows us to-day how few are its workingmen, still engaged at a\r\nwork that they have been apprenticed in. The employes are of the most\r\nvaried, heterogeneous trades; a short time suffices to train them in any\r\nsub-department of work, at which, in accord with the ruling system of\r\nexploitation, they are then kept at work longer hours, without change or\r\nregard to their inclinations, and, lashed to the machine, become\r\nthemselves a machine.[183] Such a state of things has no place in a\r\nchanged organization of society. There is ample time for the acquisition\r\nof dexterity of hand and the exercise of artistic skill. Spacious\r\ntraining schools, equipped with all necessary comforts and technical\r\nperfections will facilitate to young and old the acquisition of any\r\ntrade. Chemical and physical laboratories, up to all the demands of\r\nthese sciences, and furnished with ample staffs of instructors will be\r\nin existence. Only then will be appreciated to its full magnitude what a\r\nworld of ambitions and faculties the capitalist system of production\r\nsuppresses, or forces awry into mistaken paths.[184]\r\n\r\nIt is not merely possible to have a regard for the need of change; it is\r\nthe purpose of society to realize its satisfaction: the harmonious\r\ngrowth of man depends upon that. The professional physiognomies that\r\nmodern society brings to the surface--whether the profession be in\r\ncertain occupations of some sort or other, or in gluttony and idleness,\r\nor in compulsory tramping--will gradually vanish. There are to-day\r\nprecious few people with any opportunity of change in their occupations,\r\nor who exercise the same. Occasionally, individuals are found who,\r\nfavored by circumstances, withdraw from the routine of their daily\r\npursuits and, after having paid their tribute to physical, recreate\r\nthemselves with intellectual work; and conversely, brain workers are met\r\noff and on, who seek and find change in physical labors of some sort or\r\nother, handwork, gardening, etc. Every hygienist will confirm the\r\ninvigorating effect of a pursuit that rests upon alternating physical\r\nand mental work; only such a pursuit is natural. The only qualification\r\nis that it be moderately indulged, and in proportion to the strength of\r\nthe individual.\r\n\r\nLeo Tolstoi lashes the hypertrophic and unnatural character that art and\r\nscience have assumed under the unnatural conditions of modern\r\nsociety.[185] He severely condemns the contempt for physical labor,\r\nentertained in modern society, and he recommends a return to natural\r\nconditions. Every being, who means to live according to the laws of\r\nnature and enjoy life, should divide the day between, first, physical\r\nfield labor; secondly, hand work; thirdly, mental work; fourthly,\r\ncultured and companionable intercourse. More than eight hours' physical\r\nwork should not be done. Tolstoi, who practices this system of life, and\r\nwho, as he says, has felt himself human only since he put it into\r\npractice, perceives only what is possible to him, a rich, independent\r\nman, but wholly impossible to the large mass of mankind, under existing\r\nconditions. The person who must do hard physical work every day ten,\r\ntwelve and more hours, to gain a meager existence, and who was brought\r\nup in ignorance, can not furnish himself with the Tolstoian system of\r\nlife. Neither can they, who are on the firing line of business life and\r\nare compelled to submit to its exactions. The small minority who could\r\nimitate Tolstoi have, as a rule, no need to do so. It is one of the\r\nillusions that Tolstoi yields to, the belief that social systems can be\r\nchanged by preaching and example. The experiences made by Tolstoi with\r\nhis system of life prove how rational the same is; in order, however, to\r\nintroduce such a system of life as a social custom, a social foundation\r\nis requisite other than the present. It requires a new society.\r\n\r\n_Future society will have such a foundation; it will have scientists and\r\nartists of all sorts in abundance; but all of them will work physically\r\na part of the day, and devote the rest, according to their liking, to\r\nstudy, the arts or companionable intercourse._[186]\r\n\r\nThe existing contrast between mental and manual labor--a contrast that\r\nthe ruling classes seek to render as pronounced as possible with the\r\nview of securing for themselves also the intellectual means of\r\nsovereignty--will likewise be removed.\r\n\r\nIt follows from the preceding arguments that crises and compulsory\r\nidleness are impossible phenomena in the new social Order. Crises arise\r\nfrom the circumstance that individualist, capitalist production--incited\r\nby profit and devoid of all reliable gauge with which to ascertain the\r\nactual demand--brings an overstocking of the world's market, and thus\r\noverproduction. The merchandise feature of the products under\r\ncapitalism, of the products that their owners endeavor to exchange,\r\nmakes the use of the product dependent upon the consumer's _capacity to\r\nbuy_. The capacity to buy is, however, limited, in so far as the\r\noverwhelming majority are concerned, they being under-paid for their\r\nlabor, or even wholly unable to sell the same if the capitalist does not\r\nhappen to be able to squeeze a surplus value out of it. _The capacity to\r\nbuy and the capacity to consume are two wholly distinct things in\r\ncapitalist society._ Many millions of people are in want of clothes,\r\nshoes, furniture, linen, eatables and drinkables, but they have no\r\nmoney, and their wants, i. e., their capacity to consume, remains\r\nunsatisfied. The market is glutted with goods, but the masses suffer\r\nhunger; they are willing to work, but they find none to buy their\r\nlabor-power because the holder of money sees nothing to \"make\" in the\r\npurchase. \"Die, canaille; become vagabonds, criminals! I, the\r\ncapitalist, can not help it. I have no use for goods that I have no\r\npurchaser to buy from me with corresponding profit.\" And, in a way, the\r\nman is right.\r\n\r\nIn the new social Order this contradiction is wiped out. Socialist\r\nsociety produces not \"merchandise,\" in order to \"buy\" and to \"sell;\" _it\r\nproduces necessaries of life, that are used, consumed, and otherwise\r\nhave no object_. In Socialist society, accordingly, the capacity to\r\nconsume is not bounded, as in bourgeois society, by the individual's\r\ncapacity to buy; _it is bounded by the collective capacity to produce_.\r\nIf labor and instruments of labor are in existence, all wants can be\r\nsatisfied; the social capacity to consume is bounded only by _the\r\nsatisfaction of the consumers_.\r\n\r\nThere being no \"merchandise\" in Socialist society, neither can there be\r\nany \"money.\" Money is the visible contrast of merchandise; yet itself is\r\nmerchandise! Money, though itself merchandise, is at the same time the\r\nsocial equivalent for all other articles of merchandise. But Socialist\r\nsociety produces no articles of merchandise, only articles of use and\r\nnecessity, whose production requires a certain measure of social labor.\r\nThe time, on an average requisite for the production of an article is\r\nthe only standard by which it is measured for social use. Ten minutes\r\nsocial labor in one article are equal to ten minutes social labor in\r\nanother--neither more nor less. Society is not \"on the make\"; it only\r\nseeks to effect among its members the exchange of articles of equal\r\nquality, equal utility. It need not even set up a standard of use value.\r\nIt merely produces what it needs. If society finds that a three-hour\r\nwork day is requisite for the production of all that is needed, it\r\nestablishes such a term of work.[187] If the methods of production\r\nimprove in such wise that the supply can be raised in two hours, the\r\ntwo-hour work day is established. If, on the contrary, society demands\r\nthe gratification of higher wants than, despite the increase of forces\r\nand the improved productivity of the process of labor, can be satisfied\r\nwith two or three hours work, then the four-hour day is introduced. Its\r\nwill is law.\r\n\r\nHow much social labor will be requisite for the production of any\r\narticle is easily computed.[188] The relation of the part to the whole\r\nof the working time is measured accordingly. Any voucher--a printed\r\npiece of paper, gold or tin--certifies to the time spent in work, and\r\nenables its possessor to exchange it for articles of various kinds.[189]\r\nIf he finds that his wants are smaller than what he receives for his\r\nlabor, he then works proportionally shorter hours. If he wishes to give\r\naway what he does not consume, nothing hinders him. If he is disposed to\r\nwork for another out of his own free will, so that the latter may revel\r\nin the _dolce far niente_,--if he chooses to be such a blockhead,\r\nnothing hinders him. But none can compel him to work for another; none\r\ncan withhold from him a part of what is due him for labor performed.\r\nEveryone can satisfy all his legitimate desires--only not at the expense\r\nof others. He receives the equivalent of what he has rendered to\r\nsociety--neither more nor less, and he remains free from all\r\nexploitation by third parties.\r\n\r\n\"But what becomes of the difference between the lazy and the\r\nindustrious? between the intelligent and the stupid?\" That is one of the\r\nprincipal questions from our opponents, and the answer gives them no\r\nslight headache. That this distinction between the \"lazy\" and the\r\n\"industrious,\" the \"intelligent\" and the \"stupid\" is not made in our\r\ncivil service hierarchy, but that the term of service decides in the\r\nmatter of salary and generally of promotion also--these are facts that\r\noccur to none of these would-be puzzlers and wiseacres. The teachers,\r\nthe professors--and as a rule the latter are the silliest\r\nquestioners--move into their posts, not according to their own\r\nqualities, but according to the salaries that these posts bring. That\r\npromotions in the army and in the hierarchies of the civil service and\r\nthe learned professions are often made, not according to worth, but\r\naccording to birth, friendship and female influence, is a matter of\r\npublic notoriety. That, however, wealth also is not measured by\r\ndiligence and intelligence may be judged by the Berlin inn-keepers,\r\nbakers and butchers, to whom grammar often is a mystery, and who figure\r\nin the first of the three classes of the Prussian electorate, while the\r\nintellectuals of Berlin, the men of science, the highest magistrates of\r\nthe Empire and the State, vote with the second class. There is not now\r\nany difference between the \"lazy\" and the \"diligent,\" the \"intelligent\"\r\nand the \"stupid\" for the simple reason that what is understood by these\r\nterms exists no longer. A \"lazy\" fellow society only calls him who has\r\nbeen thrown out of work, is compelled to lead a vagabond's life and\r\nfinally does become a vagabond, or who, grown up under improper\r\ntraining, sinks into vice. But to style \"lazy fellow\" the man who rolls\r\nin money and kills the day with idleness or debauchery, would be an\r\ninsult: he is a \"worthy and good man.\"\r\n\r\nHow do matters stand in Socialist society? All develop under equal\r\nconditions, and each is active in that to which inclination and skill\r\npoint him, whence differences in work will be but insignificant.[190]\r\nThe intellectual and moral atmosphere of society, which stimulates all\r\nto excel one another, likewise aids in equalizing such differences. If\r\nany person finds that he cannot do as much as others on a certain field,\r\nhe chooses another that corresponds with his strength and faculties.\r\nWhoever has worked with a large number of people in one establishment\r\nknows that men who prove themselves unfit and useless in a certain line,\r\ndo excellent work in another. There is no normally constructed being who\r\nfails to meet the highest demands in one line or another, the moment he\r\nfinds himself in the right place. By what right does any claim\r\nprecedence over another? If any one has been treated so step-motherly by\r\nNature that with the best will he can not do what others can, _Society\r\nhas no right to punish him for the shortcomings of Nature_. If, on the\r\ncontrary, a person has received from Nature gifts that raise him above\r\nothers, _Society is not obliged to reward what is not his personal\r\ndesert_. In Socialist society all enjoy equal conditions of life and\r\nopportunities for education; all are furnished the same opportunities to\r\ndevelop their knowledge and powers according to their respective\r\ncapacities and inclinations. In this lies a further guarantee that not\r\nonly will the standard of culture and powers be higher in Socialist than\r\nin bourgeois society, but also that both will be more equally\r\ndistributed and yet be much more manifold.\r\n\r\nWhen, on a journey up the Rhine, Goethe studied the Cathedral of\r\nCologne, he discovered in the archives that the old master-builders paid\r\ntheir workmen equal wages for equal time. They did so because they\r\nwished to get good and conscientious work. This looks like an anomaly to\r\nmodern bourgeois society. It introduced the system of piece-work, that\r\ndrives the workingmen to out-work one another, and thus aids the\r\nemployer in underpaying and in reducing wages.\r\n\r\nAs with manual, so with mental work. Man is the product of the time and\r\ncircumstances that he lives in. A Goethe, born under equally favorable\r\nconditions in the fourth, instead of the eighteenth, century might have\r\nbecome, instead of a distinguished poet and naturalist, a great Father\r\nof the Church, who might have thrown St. Augustine into the shade. If,\r\non the other hand, instead of being the son of a rich Frankfort\r\npatrician, Goethe had been born the son of a poor shoemaker of the same\r\ntown, he never would have become the Minister of the Grand Duke of\r\nWeimar, but would probably have remained a shoemaker, and died an\r\nhonorable member of the craft. Goethe himself recognized the advantage\r\nhe had in being born in a materially and socially favorable station in\r\norder to reach his stage of development. It so appears in his \"Wilhelm\r\nMeister.\" Were Napoleon I. born ten years later, he never would have\r\nbeen Emperor of France. Without the war of 1870-1871, Gambetta had never\r\nbecome what he did become. Place the naturally gifted child of\r\nintelligent parents among savages, and he becomes a savage. _Whatever a\r\nman is, society has made him._ Ideas are not creations that spring from\r\nthe head of the individual out of nothing, or through inspiration from\r\nabove; they are products of social life, of the _Spirit of the Age_,\r\nraised in the head of the individual. An Aristotle could not possibly\r\nhave the ideas of a Darwin, and a Darwin could not choose but think\r\notherwise than an Aristotle. Man thinks according as the Spirit of the\r\nAge, i. e., his surroundings and the phenomena that they present to him\r\ndrive him to think. Hence the experience of different people often\r\nthinking simultaneously the same thing, of the same inventions and\r\ndiscoveries being made simultaneously in places far apart from each\r\nother. Hence also the fact that an idea, uttered fifty years too early,\r\nleaves the world cold; fifty years later, sets it ablaze. Emperor\r\nSigismund could risk breaking his word to Huss in 1415 and order him\r\nburned in Constance; Charles V., although a more violent fanatic, was\r\ncompelled to allow Luther to depart in peace from the Reichstag at Worms\r\nin 1521. Ideas are, accordingly, the product of combined social causes\r\nand social life. What is true of society in general, is true in\r\nparticular of the several classes that, at given historic epochs,\r\nconstitute society. As each class has its special interests, it also has\r\nits special ideas and views, that lead to those class struggles of which\r\nrecorded history is full, and that reach their climax in the class\r\nantagonisms and class struggles of modern days. Hence, it depends not\r\nmerely upon the age in which a man lives, but also upon the social\r\nstratum of a certain age in which he lived or lives, and whereby his\r\nfeelings, thoughts and actions are determined.\r\n\r\nWithout modern society, no modern ideas. That is obvious. With regard to\r\nthe future social Order, it must be furthermore added that the means\r\nwhereby the individual develops are the property of society. Society\r\ncan, accordingly, not be bound to render special homage to what itself\r\nmade possible and is its own product.\r\n\r\nSo much on the qualification of manual and brain work. It follows that\r\nthere can be no real distinction between \"higher\" and \"lower\" manual\r\nwork, such as not infrequently a mechanic to-day affects towards the\r\nday-laborer, who performs work on the street, or the like. Society\r\ndemands only socially necessary work; hence all work is of equal value\r\nto society. If work that is disagreeable and repulsive can not be\r\nperformed mechanically or chemically and by some process converted into\r\nwork that is agreeable--a prospect that may not be put in doubt, seeing\r\nthe progress made on the fields of technique and chemistry--and if the\r\nnecessary volunteer forces can not be raised, then the obligation lies\r\nupon each, as soon as is his turn, to do his part. False ideas of shame,\r\nabsurd contempt for useful work, become obsolete conceptions. These\r\nexist only in our society of drones, where to do nothing is regarded as\r\nan enviable lot, and the worker is despised in proportion to the\r\nhardness and disagreeableness of his work, and in proportion to its\r\nsocial usefulness. To-day work is badly paid in proportion as it is\r\ndisagreeable. The reason is that, due to the constant revolutionizing of\r\nthe process of production, a permanent mass of superfluous labor lies on\r\nthe street, and, in order to live, sells itself for such vile work, and\r\nat such prices that the introduction of machinery in these departments\r\nof labor does not \"pay.\" Stone-breaking, for instance, is proverbially\r\none of the worst paid and most disagreeable kinds of work. It were a\r\ntrifling matter to have the stone-breaking done by machinery, as in the\r\nUnited States; but we have such a mass of cheap labor-power that the\r\nmachine would not \"pay.\"[191] Street and sewer cleaning, the carting\r\naway of refuse, underground work of all sorts, etc., could, with the aid\r\nof machinery and technical contrivances, even at our present state of\r\ndevelopment, be all done in such manner that no longer would any trace\r\nof disagreeableness attach to the work. Carefully considered, the\r\nworkingman who cleans out a sewer and thereby protects people from\r\nmiasmas, is a very useful member of society; whereas a professor who\r\nteaches falsified history in the interest of the ruling classes, or a\r\ntheologian who seeks to befog the mind with supernatural and\r\ntranscendental doctrines are highly injurious beings.\r\n\r\nThe learned fraternity of to-day, clad in offices and dignities, to a\r\nlarge extent represents a guild intended and paid to defend and justify\r\nthe rule of the leading classes with the authority of science; to make\r\nthem appear good and necessary; and to prop up existing superstitions.\r\nIn point of fact this guild is largely engaged in the trade of quackery\r\nand brain-poisoning--a work injurious to civilization, intellectual\r\nwage-labor in the interest of the capitalist class and its clients.[192]\r\nA social condition, that should make impossible the existence of such\r\nelements, would perform an act towards the liberation of humanity.\r\n\r\nGenuine science, on the other hand, is often connected with highly\r\ndisagreeable and repulsive work, such, for instance, as when a physician\r\nexamines a corpse in a state of decomposition, or operates on supurating\r\nwounds, or when a chemist makes experiments. These often are labors more\r\nrepulsive than the most repulsive ones ever performed by day-laborers\r\nand untutored workingmen. Few recognize the fact. The difference lies in\r\nthat the one requires extensive studies in order to perform it, whereas\r\nthe other can be performed by anyone without preparatory studies. Hence\r\nthe radical difference in the estimation of the two. But in a society\r\nwhere, in virtue of the amplest opportunities of education afforded to\r\nall, the present distinction between \"cultured\" and \"uncultured\" ceases\r\nto exist, the contrast is likewise bound to vanish between learned and\r\nunlearned work, all the more seeing that technical development knows no\r\nlimits and manual labor may be likewise performed by machinery or\r\ntechnical contrivances. We need but look at the development of our art\r\nhandicrafts--xylography and copper-etching, for instance. As it turns\r\nout that the most disagreeable kinds of work often are the most useful,\r\nso also is our conception regarding agreeable and disagreeable work,\r\nlike so many other modern conceptions, utterly superficial; it is a\r\nconception that has an eye to externals only.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe moment production is carried on in Socialist society upon the lines\r\ntraced above, it no longer produces \"merchandise,\" but only articles of\r\nuse for the direct demand of society. Commerce, accordingly, ceases,\r\nhaving its sense and reason for being only in a social system that rests\r\nupon the production of goods for sale. A large army of persons of both\r\nsexes is thus set free for productive work.[193] This large army, set\r\nfree for production, not only increases the volume of wealth produced,\r\nbut makes possible a reduction of the hours of work. These people are\r\nto-day more or less parasites: they are supported by the work of others:\r\nin many instances they must toil diligently in return for a meagre\r\nexistence. In Socialist society they are superfluous as merchants,\r\nhosts, brokers and agents. In lieu of the dozens, hundreds and thousands\r\nof stores and commercial establishments of all sorts, that to-day every\r\ncommunity holds in proportion to its size, large municipal stores step\r\nin, elegant bazaars, actual exhibitions, requiring a relatively small\r\nadministrative personnel. This change in itself represents a revolution\r\nin all previous institutions. The tangled mass of modern commerce is\r\ntransformed into a centralized and purely administrative department,\r\nwith only the simplest of functions, that can not choose but grow still\r\nsimpler through the progressive centralization of all social\r\ninstitutions. Likewise does the whole system of transportation and\r\ncommunication undergo a complete change.\r\n\r\nThe telegraph, railroads, Post Office, river and ocean vessels, street\r\nrailways--whatever the names of the vehicles and institutions may be\r\nthat attend to the transportation and communication of capitalist\r\nsociety--now become _social_ property. Many of these institutions--Post\r\nOffices, telegraph and railroads generally--are now State institutions\r\nin Germany. Their transformation into social property presents no\r\ndifficulties: there no private interests are left to hurt: if the State\r\ncontinues to develop in that direction, all the better. But these\r\ninstitutions, administered by the State, are no Socialist institutions,\r\nas they are mistakenly taken for. They are business plants, that are\r\nexploited as capitalistically as if they were in private hands. Neither\r\nthe officers nor the workingmen have any special benefit from them. The\r\nState treats them just as any private capitalist. When, for instance,\r\norders were issued not to engage any workingman over 40 years of age in\r\nthe railway or marine service of the Empire, the measure carries on its\r\nbrows the class stamp of the State of the exploiters, and is bound to\r\nraise the indignation of the working class. Such and similar measures\r\nthat proceed from the State as an employer of labor are even worse than\r\nif they proceed from private employers. As against the State, the latter\r\nis but a small employer, and the occupation that this one denies another\r\nmight grant. The State, on the contrary, being a monopolistic employer,\r\ncan, at one stroke, cast thousands of people into misery with its\r\nregulations. That is not Socialist, it is capitalist conduct; and the\r\nSocialist guards against allowing the present State ownership being\r\nregarded as Socialism, or the realization of Socialist aspirations. In a\r\nSocialist institution there are no employers. The leader, chosen for the\r\npurpose, can only carry out the orders and superintend the execution of\r\nthe disciplinary and other measures prescribed by the collectivity\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nAs in the instance of the millions of private producers, dealers and\r\nmiddlemen of all sorts, large centralized establishments take their\r\nplace, so does the whole system of transportation and communication\r\nassume new shape. The myriads of small shipments to as many consignees\r\nthat consume a mass of powers and of time, now grow into large shipments\r\nto the municipal depots and the central places of production. Here also\r\nlabor is simplified. The transportation of raw material to an\r\nestablishment of a thousand workers is an infinitely simpler matter than\r\nto a thousand small and scattered establishments. Thus centralized\r\nlocalities of production and of transportation for whole communities, or\r\ndivisions of the same, will introduce a great saving of time, of labor,\r\nof material, and of means both of production and distribution. The\r\nbenefit accrues to the whole community, and to each individual therein.\r\nThe physiognomy of our productive establishments, of our system of\r\ntransportation and communication, especially also of our habitations,\r\nwill be completely altered for the better. The nerve-racking noise,\r\ncrowding and rushing of our large cities with their thousands of\r\nvehicles of all sorts ceases substantially: society assumes an aspect of\r\ngreater repose. The opening of streets and their cleaning, the whole\r\nsystem of life and of intercourse acquires new character. Hygienic\r\nmeasures--possible to-day only at great cost and then only partially,\r\nnot infrequently only in the quarters of the rich--can be introduced\r\nwith ease everywhere. To-day \"the common people\" do not need them; they\r\ncan wait till the funds are ready; and these never are.\r\n\r\nSuch a system of communication and transportation can not then choose\r\nbut reach a high grade of perfection. Who knows but aerial navigation\r\nmay then become a chief means of travel. The lines of transportation and\r\ncommunication are the arteries that carry the exchange of\r\nproducts--circulation of the blood--throughout the whole body social,\r\nthat effect personal and mental intercourse between man and man. They\r\nare, consequently, highly calculated to establish an equal level of\r\nwell-being and culture throughout society. The extension and\r\nramification of the most perfect means of transportation and\r\ncommunication into the remotest corners of the land is, accordingly, _a\r\nnecessity and a matter of general social interest_. On this field there\r\narise before the new social system tasks that go far beyond any that\r\nmodern society can put to itself. Finally, such a perfected system of\r\ntransportation and communication, will promote the decentralization of\r\nthe mass of humanity that is to-day heaped up in the large cities. It\r\nwill distribute the same over the country, and thus--in point of\r\nsanitation as well as of mental and material progress--it will assume a\r\nsignificance of inestimable value.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the means of production in industry and transportation, land holds\r\na leading place, being the source of all human effort and the foundation\r\nof all human existence, hence, of Society itself. Society resumes at its\r\nadvanced stage of civilization, what it originally possessed. Among all\r\nraces on earth that reached a certain minimum degree of culture, we find\r\ncommunity in land, and the system continues in force with such people\r\nwherever they are still in existence. Community in land constituted the\r\nfoundation of all primitive association: the latter was impossible\r\nwithout the former. Not until the rise and development of private\r\nproperty and of the forms of rulership therewith connected, and then\r\nonly under a running struggle, that extends deep into our own times, was\r\nthe system of common ownership in land ended, and the land usurped as\r\nprivate property. The robbery of the land and its transformation into\r\nprivate property furnished, as we have seen, the first source of that\r\nbondage that, extending from chattel slavery to the \"freedom\" of the\r\nwage-earner of our own century, has run through all imaginable stages,\r\nuntil finally the enslaved, after a development of thousands of years\r\nre-convert the land into common property.\r\n\r\nThe importance of land to human existence is such that in all social\r\nstruggles the world has ever known--whether in India, China, Egypt,\r\nGreece (Cleomenes), Rome (the Gracchi), Christian Middle Ages (religious\r\nsects, Munzer, the Peasants War), in the empires of the Aztecs and of\r\nthe Incas, or in the several upheavals of latter days--the possession of\r\nland is the principal aim of the combatants. And even to-day, the public\r\nownership of land finds its justifiers in such men as Adolf Samter,\r\nAdolf Wagner, Dr. Schaeffle, who on other domains of the Social Question\r\nare ready to rest content with half-measures.[194]\r\n\r\nThe well-being of the population depends first of all upon the proper\r\ncultivation of the land. To raise the same to the highest degree of\r\nperfection is eminently a matter of public concern. That the\r\ncultivation of the land can reach the necessary high degree of\r\nperfection neither under the large, nor the middle, least of all under\r\nthe small landlord system, has been previously shown. The most\r\nprofitable cultivation of land depends not merely upon the special care\r\nbestowed upon it. Elements come here into consideration that neither the\r\nlargest private holder, nor the mightiest association of these is equal\r\nto cope with. These are elements that lap over, even beyond the reach of\r\nthe State and require international treatment.\r\n\r\nSociety must first of all consider the land as a whole--its\r\ntopographical qualities, its mountains, plains, woods, lakes, rivers,\r\nponds, heaths, swamps, moors, etc. The topography, together with the\r\ngeographical location of land, both of which are unchangeable, exercises\r\ncertain influences upon climate and the qualities of the soil. Here is\r\nan immense field on which a mass of experience is to be gathered and a\r\nmass of experiments to be made. What the State has done until now in\r\nthis line is meager. What with the small means that it applies to these\r\npurposes, and what with the limitations imposed upon it by the large\r\nlandlords, who even if the State were willing, would check it, little or\r\nnothing has been done. The State could do nothing on this field without\r\ngreatly encroaching upon private property. Seeing, however, that its\r\nvery existence is conditioned upon the safe-keeping and \"sacredness\" of\r\nprivate property, the large landlords are vital to it, and it is\r\nstripped of the power, even if it otherwise had the will, to move in\r\nthat direction. Socialist society will have the task of undertaking vast\r\nimprovements of the soil,--raising woods here, and dismantling others\r\nyonder, draining and irrigating, mixing and changing of soil, planting,\r\netc., in order to raise the land to the highest point of productivity\r\nthat it is capable of.\r\n\r\nAn important question, connected with the improvement of the land, is\r\nthe contrivance of an ample and systematically planned network of rivers\r\nand canals, conducted upon scientific principles. The question of\r\n\"cheaper\" transportation on the waterways--a question of such gravity to\r\nmodern society--loses all importance in Socialist society, seeing that\r\nthe conceptions \"cheap\" and \"dear\" are unknown to it. On the other hand,\r\nhowever, waterways, as comfortable means of transportation, that can,\r\nmoreover, be utilized with but slight expenditure of strength and\r\nmatter, deserve attention. Moreover river and canal systems play\r\nimportant _roles_ in the matter of climate, draining and irrigation, and\r\nthe supply of fertilizers and other materials needed in the improvement\r\nof agricultural land.\r\n\r\nExperience teaches that poorly-watered regions suffer more severely from\r\ncold winters and hot summers than well-watered lands, whence coast\r\nregions are exempt from the extremes of temperature, or rarely undergo\r\nthem. Extremes of temperature are favorable neither to plants nor man.\r\nAn extensive system of canalization, in connection with the proper\r\nforestry regulations, would unquestionably exercise beneficent\r\ninfluences. Such a system of canalization, along with the building of\r\nlarge reservoirs, that will collect the water in cases of freshets\r\nthrough thaws or heavy rainfalls, would be of great usefulness. Freshets\r\nand their devastating results would be impossible. Wide expanses of\r\nwater, together with their proportional evaporations, would also, in all\r\nprobability, bring about a more regular rain-fall. Finally such\r\ninstitutions would facilitate the erection of works for an extensive\r\nsystem of irrigation whenever needed.\r\n\r\nLarge tracts of land, until now wholly barren or almost so, could be\r\ntransformed into fertile regions by means of artificial irrigation.\r\nWhere now sheep can barely graze, and at best consumptive-looking pine\r\ntrees raise their thin arms heavenward, rich crops could grow and a\r\ndense population find ample nutriment. It is merely a question of labor\r\nwhether the vast sand tracts of the Mark, the \"holy dust-box of the\r\nGerman Empire,\" shall be turned into an Eden. The fact was pointed out\r\nin an address delivered in the spring of 1894 on the occasion of the\r\nagricultural exposition in Berlin.[195] The requisite improvements,\r\ncanals, provisions for irrigation, mixing of soil, etc., are matters,\r\nhowever, that can be undertaken neither by the small nor the large\r\nlandlords of the Mark. Hence those vast tracts, lying at the very gates\r\nof the capital of the Empire, remain in a state of such backward\r\ncultivation that it will seem incredible to future generations. Again, a\r\nproper canalization would, by draining, reclaim for cultivation vast\r\nswamps and marshes in North as well as South Germany. These waterways\r\ncould be furthermore utilized in raising fish; they could thus be vast\r\nsources of food; in neighborhoods where there are no rivers, they would\r\nfurnish opportunity for commodious bath-houses.\r\n\r\nLet a few examples illustrate the effectiveness of irrigation. In the\r\nneighborhood of Weissensfels, 7½ hectares of well-watered meadows\r\nproduced 480 cwt. of after-grass; 5 contiguous hectares of meadow land\r\nof the same quality, but not watered, yielded only 32 cwt. The former\r\nhad, accordingly, a crop ten times as large as the latter. Near Reisa in\r\nSaxony, the irrigation of 65 acres of meadow lands raised their revenue\r\nfrom 5,850 marks to 11,100 marks. The expensive outlays paid. Besides\r\nthe Mark there are in Germany other vast tracts, whose soil, consisting\r\nmainly of sand, yields but poor returns, even when the summer is wet.\r\nCrossed and irrigated by canals, and their soil improved, these lands\r\nwould within a short time yield five and ten times as much. There are\r\nexamples in Spain of the yield of well-irrigated lands exceeding\r\nthirty-seven fold that of others that are not irrigated. Let there but\r\nbe water, and increased volumes of food are conjured into existence.\r\n\r\nWhere are the private individuals, where the States, able to operate\r\nupon the requisite scale? When, after long decades of bitter experience,\r\nthe State finally yields to the stormy demands of a population that has\r\nsuffered from all manner of calamities, and only after millions of\r\nvalues have been destroyed, how slow, with what circumspection, how\r\ncautious does it proceed! It is so easy to do too much, and the State\r\nmight by its precipitancy lose the means with which to build some new\r\nbarracks for the accommodation of a few regiments. Then also, if one is\r\nhelped \"too much,\" others come along, and also want help. \"Man, help\r\nyourself and God will help you,\" thus runs the bourgeois creed. Each for\r\nhimself, none for all. And thus, hardly a year goes by without once,\r\ntwice and oftener more or less serious freshets from brooks, rivers or\r\nstreams occurring in several provinces and States: vast tracts of\r\nfertile lands are then devastated by the violence of the floods, and\r\nothers are covered with sand, stone and all manner of debris; whole\r\norchard plantations, that demanded tens of years for their growth, are\r\nuprooted; houses, bridges, dams are washed away; railroad tracks torn\r\nup; cattle, not infrequently human beings also, are drowned; soil\r\nimprovements are carried off; crops ruined. Vast tracts, exposed to\r\nfrequent inundations, are cultivated but slightly, lest the loss be\r\ndouble.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, unskilful corrections of the channels of large rivers\r\nand streams,--undertaken in one-sided interests, to which the State ever\r\nyields readily in the service of \"trade and transportation\"--increase\r\nthe dangers of freshets. Extensive cutting down of forests, especially\r\non highlands and for private profit, adds more grist to the flood mill.\r\nThe marked deterioration of the climate and decreased productivity of\r\nthe soil, noticeable in the provinces of Prussia, Pomerania, the\r\nSteuermark, Italy, France, Spain, etc., is imputed to this vandalic\r\ndevastation of the woods, done in the interest of private parties.\r\n\r\nFrequent freshets are the consequence of the dismantling of mountain\r\nwoodlands. The inundations of the Rhine, the Oder and the Vistula are\r\nascribed mainly to the devastation of the woods in Switzerland, Galicia\r\nand Poland; and likewise in Italy with regard to the Po. Due to the\r\nbaring of the Carnian Alps, the climate of Triest and Venice has\r\nmaterially deteriorated. Madeira, a large part of Spain, vast and once\r\nluxurious fields of Asia Minor have in a great measure forfeited their\r\nfertility through the same causes.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that Socialist society will not be able to\r\naccomplish all these great tasks out-of-hand. But it can and will\r\nundertake them, with all possible promptness and with all the powers at\r\nits command, seeing that its sole mission is to solve problems of\r\ncivilization and to tolerate no hindrance. Thus it will in the course of\r\ntime solve problems and accomplish feats that modern society can give no\r\nthought to, and the very thought of which gives it the vertigo.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of the soil will, accordingly, be mightily improved in\r\nSocialist society, through these and similar measures. But other\r\nconsiderations, looking to the proper exploitation of the soil, are\r\nadded to these. To-day, many square miles are planted with potatoes,\r\nwhich are to be applied mainly to the distilling of brandy, an article\r\nconsumed almost exclusively by the poor classes of the population.\r\nLiquor is the only stimulant and \"care-dispeller\" that they are able to\r\nprocure. The population of Socialist society needs none of that, hence\r\nthe raising of potatoes and corn for that purpose, together with the\r\nlabor therein expended, are set free for the production of healthy\r\nfood.[196] The speculative purposes that our most fertile fields are put\r\nto in the matter of the sugar beet for the exportation of sugar, have\r\nbeen pointed out in a previous chapter. About 400,000 hectares of the\r\nbest wheat fields are yearly devoted to the cultivation of sugar beet,\r\nin order to supply England, the United States and Northern Europe with\r\nsugar. The countries whose climate favors the growth of sugar cane\r\nsuccumb to this competition. Furthermore, our system of a standing army,\r\nthe disintegration of production, the disintegration of the means of\r\ntransportation and communication, the disintegration of agriculture,\r\netc.,--all these demand hundreds of thousands of horses, with the\r\ncorresponding fields to feed them and to raise colts. The completely\r\ntransformed social and political conditions free the bulk of the lands\r\nthat are now given up to these various purposes; and again large areas\r\nand rich labor-power are reclaimed for purposes of civilization.\r\nLatterly, extensive fields, covering many square kilometers, have been\r\nwithdrawn from cultivation, being needed for the manoeuvering and\r\nexercising of army corps in the new methods of warfare and long\r\ndistance firearms. All this falls away.\r\n\r\nThe vast field of agriculture, forestry and irrigation has become the\r\nsubject of an extensive scientific literature. No special branch has\r\nbeen left untouched: irrigation and drainage, forestry, the cultivation\r\nof cereals, of leguminous and tuberous plants, of vegetables, of fruit\r\ntrees, of berries, of flowers and ornamental plants; fodder for cattle\r\nraising; meadows; rational methods of breeding cattle, fish and poultry\r\nand bees, and the utilization of their excrements; utilization of manure\r\nand refuse in agriculture and manufacture; chemical examinations of\r\nseeds and of the soil, to ascertain its fitness for this or that crop;\r\ninvestigations in the rotations of crops and in agricultural machinery\r\nand implements; the profitable construction of agricultural buildings of\r\nall nature; the weather;--all have been drawn within the circle of\r\nscientific treatment. Hardly a day goes by without some new discovery,\r\nsome new experience being made towards improving and ennobling one or\r\nother of these several branches. With the work of J. v. Liebig, the\r\ncultivation of the soil has become a science, indeed, one of the\r\nforemost and most important of all, a science that since then has\r\nattained a vastness and significance unique in the domain of activity in\r\nmaterial production. And yet, if we compare the fullness of the progress\r\nmade in this direction with the actual conditions prevailing in\r\nagriculture to-day, _it must be admitted that, until now, only a small\r\nfraction of the private owners have been able to turn the progress to\r\nadvantage_, and among these there naturally is none who did not proceed\r\nfrom the view point of his own private interests, acted accordingly,\r\nkept only that in mind, and gave no thought to the public weal. The\r\nlarge majority of our farmers and gardeners, we may say 98 per cent. of\r\nthem, are in no wise in condition to utilize all the advances made and\r\nadvantages that are possible: they lack either the means or the\r\nknowledge thereto, if not both: as to the others, they simply do as they\r\nplease. Socialist society finds herein a theoretically and practically\r\nwell prepared field of activity. It need but to fall to and organize in\r\norder to attain wonderful results.\r\n\r\nThe highest possible concentration of productions affords, of itself,\r\nmighty advantages. Hedges, making boundary lines, wagon roads and\r\nfootpaths between the broken-up holdings are removed, and yield some\r\nmore available soil. The application of machinery is possible only on\r\nlarge fields: agricultural machinery of fullest development, backed by\r\nchemistry and physics could to-day transform unprofitable lands, of\r\nwhich there are not a few, into fertile ones. The application of\r\naccumulated electric power to agricultural machinery--plows, harrows,\r\nrollers, sowers, mowers, threshers, seed-assorters, chaff-cutters,\r\netc.--is only a question of time. Likewise will the day come when\r\nelectricity will move from the fields the wagons laden with the crops:\r\ndraught cattle can be spared. A scientific system of fertilizing the\r\nfields, hand in hand with thorough management, irrigation and draining\r\nwill materially increase the productivity of the land. A careful\r\nselection of seeds, proper protection against weeds--in itself a head\r\nmuch sinned against to-day--sends up the yield still higher.\r\n\r\nAccording to Ruhland, a successful war upon cereal diseases would of\r\nitself suffice to render superfluous the present importation of grain\r\ninto Germany.[197] Seeding, planting and rotation of crops, being\r\nconducted with the sole end in view of raising the largest possible\r\nvolume of food, the object is then obtainable.\r\n\r\nWhat may be possible even under present conditions is shown by the\r\nmanagement of the Schnistenberg farm in the Rhenish Palatinate. In 1884\r\nthe same fell into the hand of a new tenant, who, in the course of eight\r\nyears, raised three or four times as much as his predecessor.[198] The\r\nsaid property is situated 320 meters above the level of the sea, 286\r\nacres in size, of which 18 are meadows, and has generally unfavorable\r\nsoil, 30 acres being sandy, 60 stony, 55 sand loam and 123 hard loam.\r\nThe new method of cultivation had astonishing results. The crops rose\r\nfrom year to year. The increase during the period of 1884-1892 was as\r\nfollows per acre:\r\n\r\n\r\n      Product.       1884.         1892.\r\n    Rye           7.75 cwts.   19.50 cwts.\r\n    Wheat         3.50  \"      15.30   \"\r\n    Barley       12.00  \"      18.85   \"\r\n    Oats          7.00  \"      18.85   \"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe neighboring community of Kiegsfeld, the witness of this marvelous\r\ndevelopment, followed the example and reached similar results on its own\r\nground. The yield per acre was on an average this:\r\n\r\n\r\n      Product.         1884.           1892.\r\n    Wheat           10 to 12 cwts.  13 to 18 cwts.\r\n    Rye             12 to 15  \"     15 to 20  \"\r\n    Oats             7 to  9  \"     14 to 22 and even 24\r\n    Barley           9 to 11  \"     18 to 22 cwts.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch results are eloquent enough.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of fruits, berries and garden vegetables will reach a\r\ndevelopment hardly thought possible. How unpardonably is being sinned at\r\npresent in these respects, a look at our orchards will show. They are\r\ngenerally marked by a total absence of proper care. This is true of the\r\ncultivation of fruit trees even in countries that have a reputation for\r\nthe excellence of these; Wurtemberg, for instance. The concentration of\r\nstables, depots for implements and manure and methods of\r\nfeeding--towards which wonderful progress has been made, but which can\r\nto-day be applied only slightly--will, when generally introduced,\r\nmaterially increase the returns in raising cattle, and thereby\r\nfacilitate the procurement of manure. Machinery and implements of all\r\nsorts will be there in abundance, very differently from the experience\r\nof ninety-nine one hundredths of our modern farmers. Animal products,\r\nsuch as milk, eggs, meat, honey, hair, wool, will be obtained and\r\nutilized scientifically. The improvements and advantages in the dairy\r\nindustry reached by the large dairy associations is known to all\r\nexperts, and ever new inventions and improvements are daily made. Many\r\nare the branches of agriculture in which the same and even better can be\r\ndone. The preparation of the fields and the gathering of the crops are\r\nthen attended to by large bodies of men, under skilful use of the\r\nweather, such as is to-day impossible. Large drying houses and sheds\r\nallow crops being gathered even in unfavorable weather, and save losses\r\nthat are to-day unavoidable, and which, according to v. d. Goltz, often\r\nare so severe that, during a particularly rainy year, from eight to nine\r\nmillion marks worth of crops were ruined in Mecklenburg, and from twelve\r\nto fifteen in the district of Koenigsberg.\r\n\r\nThrough the skilful application of artificial heat and moisture on a\r\nlarge scale in structures protected from bad weather, the raising of\r\nvegetables and all manner of fruit is possible at all seasons in large\r\nquantities. The flower stores of our large cities have in mid-winter\r\nfloral exhibitions that vie with those of the summer. One of the most\r\nremarkable advances made in the artificial raising of fruit is\r\nexemplified by the artificial vineyard of Garden-Director Haupt in\r\nBrieg, Silesia, which has found a number of imitators, and was itself\r\npreceded long before by a number of others in other countries, England\r\namong them. The arrangements and the results obtained in this vineyard\r\nwere so enticingly described in the \"Vossische Zeitung\" of September 27,\r\n1890, that we have reproduced the account in extracts:\r\n\r\n\"The glass-house is situated upon an approximately square field of 500\r\nsquare meters, i. e., one-fifth of an acre. It is 4.5 to 5 meters high,\r\nand its walls face north, south, east and west. Twelve rows of double\r\nfruit walls run inside due north and south. They are 1.8 meters apart\r\nfrom each other and serve at the same time as supports to the flat roof.\r\nIn a bed 1.25 meters deep, resting on a bank of earth 25 centimeters\r\nstrong and which contains a net of drain and ventilation pipes,--a bed\r\n'whose hard ground is rendered loose, permeable and fruitful through\r\nchalk, rubbish, sand, manure in a state of decomposition, bonedust and\r\npotash'--Herr Haupt planted against the walls three hundred and sixty\r\ngrape vines of the kind which yields the noblest grape juice in the\r\nRhinegau:--white and red Reissling and Tramine, white and blue\r\nMoscatelle and Burgundy.\r\n\r\n\"The ventilation of the place is effected by means of large fans, twenty\r\nmeters long, attached to the roof, besides several openings on the\r\nside-walls. The fans can be opened and shut by means of a lever,\r\nfastened on the roof provided with a spindle and winch, and they can be\r\nmade safe against all weather. For the watering of the vines 26\r\nsprinklers are used, which are fastened to rubber pipes 1.25 meters\r\nlong, and that hang down from a water tank. Herr Haupt introduced,\r\nhowever, another ingenious contrivance for quickly and thoroughly\r\nwatering his 'wine-hall' and his 'vineyard', to wit, an artificial rain\r\nproducer. On high, under the roof, lie four long copper tubes,\r\nperforated at distances of one-half meter. The streams of water that\r\nspout upward through these openings strike small round sieves made of\r\nwindow gauze and, filtered through these, are scattered in fine spray.\r\nTo thoroughly water the vines by means of the rubber pipes requires\r\nseveral hours. But only one faucet needs to be turned by this second\r\ncontrivance and a gentle refreshing rain trickles down over the whole\r\nplace upon the grape vines, the beds and the granite flags of the walks.\r\nThe temperature can be raised from 8 to 10 degrees R. above the outside\r\nair without any artificial contrivance, and simply through the natural\r\nqualities of the glass-house. In order to protect the vines from that\r\ndangerous and destructive foe, the vine louse, should it show itself, it\r\nis enough to close the drain and open all the water pipes. The\r\ninundation of the vines, thus achieved, the enemy can not withstand. The\r\nglass roof and walls protect the vineyard from storms, cold, frost and\r\nsuperfluous rain; in cases of hail, a fine wire-netting is spread over\r\nthe same; against drought the artificial rain system affords all the\r\nprotection needed. The vine-dresser of such a vineyard is his own\r\nweather-maker, and he can laugh at all the dangers from the incalculable\r\nwhims and caprices of indifferent and cruel Nature,--dangers that ever\r\nthreaten with ruin the fruit of the vine cultivator.\r\n\r\n\"What Herr Haupt expected happened. The vines thrived remarkably under\r\nthe uniformly warm climate. The grapes ripened to their fullest, and as\r\nearly as the fall of 1885 they yielded a juice not inferior to that\r\ngenerally obtained in the Rhinegau in point of richness of sugar and\r\nslightness of sourness. The grapes thrived equally the next year and\r\neven during the unfavorable year of 1887. On this space, when the vines\r\nhave reached their full height of 5 meters, and are loaded with their\r\nburden of swollen grapes, 20 hectoliters of wine can be produced yearly,\r\nand the cost of a bottle of noble wine will not exceed 40 pennies.\r\n\r\n\"There is no reason imaginable why this process should not be conducted\r\nupon a large scale like any other industry. Glass-houses of the nature\r\nof this one on one-fifth of an acre can be undoubtedly raised upon a\r\nwhole acre with equal facilities of ventilation, watering, draining and\r\nrain-making. Vegetation will start there several weeks sooner than in\r\nthe open, and the vine-shoots remain safe from May frosts, rain and cold\r\nwhile they blossom; from drought during the growth of the grapes; from\r\npilfering birds and grape thieves and from dampness while they ripen;\r\nfinally from the vine-louse during the whole year and can hang safely\r\ndeep into November and December. In his address, held in 1888 to the\r\nSociety for the Promotion of Horticulture, and from which I have taken\r\nmany a technical expression in this description of the 'Vineyard', the\r\ninventor and founder of the same closed his words with this alluring\r\nperspective of the future: 'Seeing that this vine culture can be carried\r\non all over Germany, especially on otherwise barren, sandy or stony\r\nground, such as, for instance, the worst of the Mark, that can be made\r\narable and watered, it follows that the great interests in the\r\ncultivation of the soil receive fresh vigor from \"vineyards under\r\nglass.\" I would like to call this industry \"the vineyard of the\r\nfuture\".'\r\n\r\n\"Just as Herr Haupt has furnished the practical proof that on this path\r\nan abundance of fine and healthy grapes can be drawn from the vine, he\r\nhas also proved by his own pressing of the same what excellent wine they\r\ncan yield. More thorough, more experienced, better experts and tried\r\nwine-drinkers and connoisseurs than myself have, after a severe test,\r\nbestowed enthusiastic praise upon the Reissling of the vintage of '88,\r\nupon the Tramine and Moscatelle of the vintage of '89, and upon the\r\nBurgundy of the vintage of '88, pressed from the grapes of this\r\n'vineyard'. It should also be mentioned that this 'vineyard' also\r\naffords sufficient space for the cultivation of other side and twin\r\nplants. Herr Haupt raises between every two vines one rose bush, that\r\nblossoms richly in April and May; against the east and west walls he\r\nraises peaches, whose beauty of blossom must impart in April an\r\nappearance of truly fairy charm to this wine palace.\"\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm with which the reporter describes this artificial\r\n\"vineyard\" in a serious paper testifies to the deep impression made upon\r\nhim by this extraordinary artificial cultivation. There is nothing to\r\nprevent similar establishments, on a much more stupendous scale and for\r\nother branches of vegetation. The luxury of a double crop is obtainable\r\nin many agricultural products. To-day all such undertakings are a\r\nquestion of money, and their products are accessible only to the\r\nprivileged classes. A Socialist society knows no other question than\r\nthat of sufficient labor-power. If that is in existence, the work is\r\ndone in the interest of all.\r\n\r\nAnother new invention on the field of food is that of Dr. Johann\r\nHundhausen of Hamm in Westphalia, who succeeded in extracting the\r\nalbumen of wheat--the secret of whose utilization in the legume was not\r\nyet known--in the shape of a thoroughly nutritive flour. This is a\r\nfar-reaching invention. It is now possible to render the albumen of\r\nplants useful in substantial form for human food.\r\n\r\nThe inventor erected a large factory which produces vegetal albumen or\r\naleurone meal from 80 to 83 per cent. of albumen, and a second quality\r\nof about 50 per cent. That the so-called aleurone meal represents a very\r\nconcentrated albuminous food appears from the following comparison with\r\nour best elements of nourishment:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                          Carbon-\r\n                   Water  Albumen   Fat   hydrate Cellulose Salt\r\n    Aleurone meal   8.83   82.67    0.27   7.01     0.45    0.78\r\n    Hen's eggs     73.67   12.55   12.11   0.55     0.55    1.12\r\n    Beef           55.42   17.19   26.58   ....     ....    1.08\r\n\r\n\r\nAleurone meal is not only eaten directly, it is also used as a condiment\r\nin all sorts of bakery products, as well as soups and vegetables.\r\nAleurone meal substitutes in a high degree meat preserves in point of\r\nnutrition; moreover, it is by far the cheapest albumen obtainable\r\nto-day. One kilogram of albumen costs:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In aleurone meal                             1.45 marks\r\n    In white bread or white flour            4 to 4.5   \"\r\n    In hen's eggs, according to the season   8 to 16    \"\r\n    In beef                                 12 to 13    \"\r\n\r\n\r\nBeef, accordingly, is about eight times dearer, as albuminous food, than\r\naleurone meal; eggs five times as dear; white bread or common white\r\nflour about three times as dear. Aleurone meal also has the advantage\r\nthat, with the addition of about one-eighth of the weight of a potato,\r\nit not only furnishes a considerable quantity of albumen to the body,\r\nbut produces a complete digestion of the starch contained in the potato.\r\nDogs, that have a nose for albumen, eat aleurone meal with the same\r\navidity as meat, even if they otherwise refuse bread, and they are then\r\nbetter able to stand hardships.\r\n\r\nAleurone meal, as a dry vegetal albumen, is of great use as food on\r\nships, in fortresses and in military hospitals during war. It renders\r\nlarge supplies of meat unnecessary. At present aleurone meal is a side\r\nproduct in starch factories. Within short, starch will become a side\r\nproduct of aleurone meal. A further result will be that the cultivation\r\nof cereals will crowd out that of potatoes and other less productive\r\nfood plants; the volume of nutrition of a given field of wheat or rye is\r\ntripled or quadrupled at one stroke.\r\n\r\nDr. Rudolf Meyer of Vienna, whose attention was called by us to the\r\naleurone meal says[199] that he furnished himself with a quantity of it\r\nand had it examined on June 19, 1893, by the bureau of experiments of\r\nthe Board of Soil Cultivation of the Kingdom of Bohemia. The examination\r\nfully confirmed our statements. For further details Meyer's work should\r\nbe read. Meyer also calls attention to a discovery made by Otto Redemann\r\nof Bockenheim near Frankfort-on-the-Main. After granulating the peanut\r\nand removing its oil, he analyzed its component elements of nutrition.\r\nThe analysis showed 47 per cent. of albumen, 19 of fat and 19 of\r\nstarch--altogether 2,135 units of nutritious matter in one kilo.\r\nAccording to this analysis the peanut is one of the most nutritious\r\nvegetal products. The pharmacist Rud. Simpson of Mohrungen discovered a\r\nprocess by which to remove the bitterness from the lupine, which, as may\r\nbe known, thrives best on sandy soil, and is used both as fodder and as\r\na fertilizer; and he then produced from it a meal, which, according to\r\nexpert authority, baked as bread tastes very good, is solid, is said to\r\nbe more nutritious than rye-bread, and, besides all that, much cheaper.\r\n\r\nEven under present conditions a regular revolution is plowing its way in\r\nthe matter of human food. _The utilization of all these discoveries is,\r\nhowever, slow, for the reason that mighty classes--the farmer element\r\ntogether with its social and political props--have the liveliest\r\ninterest in suppressing them._ To our agrarians, a good crop is to-day a\r\nhorror--although the same is prayed for in all the churches--because it\r\nlowers prices. Consequently, they are no wise anxious for a double and\r\nthreefold nutritive power of their cereals; it would likewise tend to\r\nlower prices. Present society is everywhere at fisticuffs with its own\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThe preservation of the soil in a state of fertility depends primarily\r\nupon fertilization. The obtaining of fertilizers is, accordingly, for\r\nfuture society also one of the principal tasks.[200] Manure is to the\r\nsoil what food is to man, and just as every kind of food is not equally\r\nnourishing to man, neither is every kind of manure of equal benefit to\r\nthe soil. The soil must receive back exactly the same chemical\r\nsubstances that it gave up through a crop; and the chemical substances\r\nespecially needed by a certain vegetable must be given to the soil in\r\nlarger quantities. Hence the study of chemistry and its practical\r\napplication will experience a development unknown to-day.\r\n\r\nAnimal and human excrements are particularly rich in the chemical\r\nelements that are fittest for the reproduction of human food. Hence the\r\nendeavor must be to secure the same in the fullest quantity and cause\r\nits proper distribution. On this head too modern society sins\r\ngrievously. Cities and industrial centers, that receive large masses of\r\nfoodstuffs, return to the soil but a slight part of their valuable\r\noffal.[201] The consequence is that the fields, situated at great\r\ndistances from the cities and industrial centers, and which yearly send\r\ntheir products to the same, suffer greatly from a dearth of manure; the\r\noffal that these farms themselves yield is often not enough, because the\r\nmen and beasts who live on them consume but a small part of the product.\r\nThus frequently a soil-vandalism is practiced, that cripples the land\r\nand decreases the crops. All countries that export agricultural products\r\nmainly, but receive no manure back, inevitably go to ruin through the\r\ngradual impoverishment of the soil. This is the case with Hungary,\r\nRussia, the Danubian Principalities, North America, etc. Artificial\r\nfertilizers, guano in particular, indeed substitute the offal of men and\r\nbeasts; but many farmers can not obtain the same in sufficient\r\nquantity; it is too dear; at any rate, it is an inversion of nature to\r\nimport manure from great distances, while it is allowed to go to waste\r\nnearby.\r\n\r\nSeveral years since has the Thomas-slag been recognized as an eminently\r\nfit manure for certain soils. The manufacturers, however, who grind the\r\nThomas-slag into flour and carry it to market, have built a ring, and,\r\nto the injury of the farming interests who make bitter complaints on\r\nthat score, they keep the prices high. Thus every progress is crippled\r\nby greed in bourgeois society. Another and at present inexhaustable\r\nsource of fertilizers is offered by the deposits of potash in the\r\nprovince of Saxony and contiguous regions. The Prussian State owns a\r\nnumber of potash works and it also made the attempt to monopolize the\r\nindustry, to the end of raising the largest possible revenues for the\r\nTreasury.\r\n\r\nIf the opinion of Julius Hensel on the subject of fertilizers proves\r\ncorrect, it will mean a revolution in the theory of fertilization, and a\r\ncomplete saving of the expenses now made for the importation of\r\nfertilizers, amounting for guano and Chile saltpeter to from 80 to 100\r\nmillion marks a year.[202] Hensel makes the emphatic claim, and produces\r\nnumerous proofs of the correctness of his views, that the mineral of our\r\nmountains contain an inexhaustible supply of the best fertilizing\r\nstuffs. Granite, porphyry, basalt, broken and ground up, spread upon the\r\nfields or vineyards and furnished with a sufficiency of water, furnished\r\na fertilizer that excelled all others, even animal and human\r\nrefuse.[203] These minerals, he claims, contain all the elements for the\r\ncultivation of plants: potash, chalk, magnesia, phosphoric, sulphuric\r\nand silicic acids, and also hydrochlorides. According to Hensel, the\r\nSudeton, Riesen, Erz, Tichtel, Hartz, Rhone, Vogel, Taunus, Eisel and\r\nWeser mountains, the woods of Thuringen, Spessart and Oden had an\r\ninexhaustible supply of fertilizers. It will be literally possible to\r\n\"make bread out of stones.\" The dust and dirt of our highways also are,\r\naccording to Hensel, inexhaustible sources of the same blessing. In this\r\nmatter we are laymen and can not test the correctness of Hensel's\r\ntheories; a part of them, however, sound most plausible. Hensel charges\r\nthe manufacturers of and dealers in artificial fertilizers with\r\nhostility to his discovery and with systematic opposition, because they\r\nwould suffer great loss.\r\n\r\nAccording to Heider, a healthy adult secretes on an average 48.8\r\nkilograms of solid and 438 of liquid matter a year. Estimated by the\r\npresent standard of the prices of manure, and if utilized without loss\r\nby evaporation, etc., this offal represents a money value of 11.8\r\nmarks. Calculating the population of Germany to be 50,000,000 in round\r\nfigures, and estimating the average value of the human offal at 8 marks,\r\nthe sum of 400,000,000 marks is obtained, which now is almost totally\r\nlost to agriculture, owing to the present imperfect methods for\r\nutilizing it. The great difficulty in the way of a full utilization of\r\nthese stuffs lies in the establishment of proper and extensive\r\nprovisions for their collection, and in the cost of transportation.\r\nRelatively, this cost is now higher than the importation of guano from\r\nfar-away transmarine deposits, which, however, decline in mass in the\r\nmeasure that the demand increases. Every living being, however, casts\r\noff regularly an annual supply of manure about enough for a field that\r\nyields food for one person. The enormous loss is obvious. A large\r\nportion of the city excrement runs out into our rivers and streams, and\r\npollutes them. Likewise is the refuse from kitchens and factories, also\r\nserviceable as manure, recklessly squandered.\r\n\r\nFuture society will find means and ways to stop this waste. What is done\r\nto-day in this direction is mere patchwork, and utterly inadequate. As\r\nan illustration of what could be done to-day, may be cited the\r\ncanalization and the laying out of vast fields in the capital of the\r\nEmpire, on whose value, however, experts are of divided opinion.\r\nSocialist society will solve the question more easily, due, in a great\r\nmeasure, to the fact that _large cities will gradually cease to exist,\r\nand population will decentralize_.\r\n\r\nNo one will regard our modern rise of metropoles as a healthy\r\nphenomenon. The modern system of manufacture and production in general,\r\nsteadily draws large masses of the population to the large cities.[204]\r\nThere is the seat of manufacture and commerce; there the avenues of\r\ncommunication converge; there the owners of large wealth have their\r\nheadquarters, the central authorities, the military staffs, the higher\r\ntribunals. There large institutions rear their heads--the academies of\r\nart, large pleasure resorts, exhibitions, museums, theaters, concert\r\nhalls, etc. Hundreds are drawn thither by their professions, thousands\r\nby pleasure, and many more thousands by the hope of easier work and an\r\nagreeable life.\r\n\r\nBut, speaking figuratively, the rise of metropolitan cities makes the\r\nimpression of a person whose girth gains steadily in size, while his\r\nlegs as steadily become thinner, and finally will be unable to carry the\r\nburden. All around, in the immediate vicinity of the cities, the\r\nvillages also assume a city aspect, in which the proletariat is heaped\r\nup in large masses. The municipalities, generally out of funds, are\r\nforced to lay on taxes to the utmost, and still remain unable to meet\r\nthe demand made upon them. When finally they have grown up to the large\r\ncity and it up to them, they rush into and are absorbed by it, as\r\nhappens with planets that have swung too close to the sun. But the fact\r\ndoes not improve the conditions of life. On the contrary, they grow\r\nworse through the crowding of people in already overcrowded spaces.\r\nThese gatherings of masses--inevitable under modern development, and, to\r\na certain extent, the raisers of revolutionary centers,--will have\r\nfulfilled their mission in Socialist society. Their gradual dissolution\r\nthen becomes necessary: _the current will then run the other way:\r\npopulation will migrate from the cities to the country: it will there\r\nraise new municipalities corresponding with the altered conditions, and\r\nthey will join their industrial with their agricultural activities_.\r\n\r\nSo soon as--due to the complete remodeling and equipment of the means of\r\ncommunication and transportation, and of the productive establishments,\r\netc., etc.--the city populations will be enabled to transfer to the\r\ncountry all their acquired habits of culture, to find there their\r\nmuseums, theaters, concert halls, reading rooms, libraries, etc.--just\r\nso soon will the migration thither set in. Life will then enjoy all the\r\ncomforts of large cities, without their disadvantages. The population\r\nwill be housed more comfortably and sanitarily. The rural population\r\nwill join in manufacturing, the manufacturing population in agricultural\r\npursuits,--a change of occupation enjoyed to-day by but few, and then\r\noften under conditions of excessive exertion.\r\n\r\nAs on all other fields, bourgeois society is promoting this development\r\nalso: every year new industrial undertakings are transferred to the\r\ncountry. The unfavorable conditions of large cities--high rents and high\r\nwages--drive many employers to this migration. At the same time, the\r\nlarge landlords are steadily becoming industrialists--manufacturers of\r\nsugar, distillers of liquor, beer brewers, manufacturers of cement,\r\nearthen wares, tiles, woodwork, paper goods, etc. In the new social\r\norder offal of all sorts will then be easily furnished to agriculture,\r\nespecially through the concentration of production and the public\r\nkitchens. Each community will, in a way, constitute a zone of culture;\r\nit will, to a large extent, itself raise its necessaries of life.\r\nHorticulture, perhaps the most agreeable of all practical occupations,\r\nwill then reach fullest bloom. The cultivation of vegetables, fruit\r\ntrees and bushes of all nature, ornamental flowers and shrubs--all offer\r\nan inexhaustible field for human activity, a field, moreover, whose\r\nnature excludes machinery almost wholly.\r\n\r\n_Thanks to the decentralization of the population, the existing contrast\r\nand antagonism between the country and the city will also vanish._\r\n\r\nThe peasant, this Helot of modern times, hitherto cut off from all\r\ncultural development through his isolation in the country, now becomes a\r\nfree being because he has fully become a limb of civilization.[205] The\r\nwish, once expressed by Prince Bismarck, that he might see the large\r\ncities destroyed, will be verified, but in a sense wholly different from\r\nthat which he had in mind.[206]\r\n\r\nIf the preceding arguments are rapidly passed in review, it will be seen\r\nthat, with the abolition of private property in the means of production\r\nand their conversion into social property, the mass evils, that modern\r\nsociety reveals at every turn and which grow ever greater and more\r\nintolerable under its sway, will gradually disappear. The over-lordship\r\nof one class and its representatives ceases. Society applies its forces\r\nplanfully and controls itself. As, with the abolition of the wage system\r\nthe ground will be taken from under the exploitation of man by man,\r\nlikewise will it be taken from under swindle and cheating--the\r\nadulteration of food, the stock exchange, etc.,--with the abolition of\r\nprivate capitalism. The halls in the Temples of Mammon will stand\r\nvacant; national bonds of indebtedness, stocks, pawn-tickets, mortgages,\r\ndeeds, etc., will have become so much waste paper. The words of\r\nSchiller: \"Let our book of indebtedness be annihilated, and the whole\r\nworld reconciled\" will have become reality, and the Biblical maxim: \"In\r\nthe sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat bread\" will now come into force for\r\nthe heroes of the stock exchange and the drones of capitalism as well.\r\nYet the labor that, as equal members of society they will have to\r\nperform, will not oppress them: their bodily health will be materially\r\nimproved. The worry of property--said to be, judging from the pathetic\r\nassurances of our employers and capitalists in general, harder to bear\r\nthan the uncertain and needy lot of the workingman--will be forever\r\nremoved from those gentlemen. The excitements of speculation, that breed\r\nso many diseases of the heart and bring on so many strokes of apoplexy\r\namong our exchange jobbers, and that render them nervous wrecks, will\r\nall be saved to them. A life free from mental worry will be their lot\r\nand that of our descendants; and in the end they will gladly accommodate\r\nthemselves thereto.\r\n\r\nWith the abolition of private property and of class antagonism, the\r\nState also gradually vanishes away;--it vanishes without being missed.\r\n\r\n\"By converting the large majority of the population more and more into\r\nproletarians, the capitalist mode of production creates the power, that,\r\nunder penalty of its own destruction, is forced to accomplish this\r\nrevolution. By urging more and more the conversion of the large, already\r\nsocialized means of production into State property, it points the path\r\nfor the accomplishment of this revolution.... The State was the official\r\nrepresentative of the whole society; it was the constitution of the\r\nlatter into a visible body; but it was so only in so far as it was the\r\nState of that class which itself, at its time, represented the whole\r\nsociety; in antiquity, the State of slave-holding citizens; in the\r\nmiddle ages, the State of the feudal nobility; in our own days, the\r\nState of the capitalist class. By at last becoming actually the\r\nrepresentative of the whole social body, it renders itself superfluous.\r\nAs soon as there is no longer any social class to be kept down; as soon\r\nas, together with class rule and the individual struggle for life,\r\nfounded in the previous anarchy of production, the conflicts and\r\nexcesses that issued therefrom have been removed, there is nothing more\r\nto be repressed, and the State or Government, as a special power of\r\nrepression, is no longer necessary. The first act, wherein the State\r\nappears as the real representative of the whole body social--the seizure\r\nof the means of production in the name of society--is also its last\r\nindependent act as State. The interference of the State in social\r\nrelations becomes superfluous in one domain after another, and falls of\r\nitself into desuetude. The place of a government over persons is taken\r\nby the administration of things and the conduct of the processes of\r\nproduction. The State is not 'abolished'--_it dies out!_\"[207]\r\n\r\nAlong with the State, die out its representatives--cabinet ministers,\r\nparliaments, standing armies, police and constables, courts, district\r\nattorneys, prison officials, tariff and tax collectors, in short, the\r\nwhole political apparatus. Barracks, and such other military structures,\r\npalaces of law and of administration, prisons--all will now await better\r\nuse. Ten thousand laws, decrees and regulations become so much rubbish;\r\nthey have only historic value. The great and yet so petty parliamentary\r\nstruggles, with which the men of tongue imagine they rule and guide the\r\nworld, are no more, they will have made room for administrative colleges\r\nand delegations whose attention will be engaged in the best means of\r\nproduction and distribution, in ascertaining the volume of supplies\r\nneeded, in introducing and applying effective improvements in art, in\r\narchitecture, in intercourse, in the process of production, etc. These\r\nare all practical matters, visible and tangible, towards which everyone\r\nstands objectively, there being no personal interests hostile to society\r\nto affect their judgment. None has any interest other than the\r\ncollectivity, and that interest consists in instituting and providing\r\neverything in the best, most effective and most profitable manner.\r\n\r\nThe hundreds of thousands of former representatives of the State pass\r\nover into the various trades, and help with their intelligence and\r\nstrength to increase the wealth and comforts of society. Henceforth\r\nthere are known neither political crimes nor common ones. There are no\r\nmore thieves, seeing that private property has ceased to be in the means\r\nof production, and everyone can now satisfy his wants with ease and\r\ncomfort by work. Tramps and vagabonds likewise cease to be; they are the\r\nproduct of a social system based on private property; the former cease\r\nto be with the latter. And murder? Why? None can grow rich at the\r\nexpense of another. Even murder out of hatred and revenge flows directly\r\nor indirectly from the modern social system. Perjury, false testimony,\r\ncheating, thefts of inheritance, fraudulent failures? There is no\r\nprivate property on and against which to commit these crimes. Arson? Who\r\nis to derive pleasure or satisfaction therefrom, seeing that society\r\nremoves from him all sources of hatred? Counterfeiting? Why, money has\r\nbecome a chimera, love's labor would be lost. Contempt for religion?\r\nNonsense. It is left to the \"omnipotent and good God\" to punish him who\r\nshould offend Him--provided there be still controversies on the\r\nexistence of God.\r\n\r\nThus all the cornerstones of the present \"order\" become myths. Parents\r\nwill tell their children stories on those heads, like legends from olden\r\ndays. The narrations of the persecutions, that men with new ideas are\r\nto-day overwhelmed with, will sound to them just as the stories of the\r\nburning of heretics and witches sound to us to-day. The names of all the\r\ngreat men, who to-day distinguish themselves by their persecutions of\r\nthe new ideas, and who are applauded by their narrow-minded\r\ncontemporaries, are forgotten and blown over, and they are run across\r\nonly by the historian who may happen to dive into the past. What remarks\r\nmay escape him, we care not to tell, seeing that, unhappily, we do not\r\nyet live in an age where man is free to breathe.\r\n\r\nAs with the State, so with \"Religion.\"[208] It is not \"abolished.\" God\r\nwill not be \"dethroned\"; religion will not be \"torn out of the hearts of\r\npeople\"; nor will any of the silly charges against the Socialists\r\nmaterialize. Such mistaken policies the Socialists leave to the\r\nBourgeois ideologists, who resorted to such means in the French\r\nRevolution and, of course, suffered miserable shipwreck. Without any\r\nviolence whatever, and without any manner of oppression of thought,\r\nreligion will gradually vanish.\r\n\r\nReligion is the transcendental reflection of the social conditions of\r\ngiven epochs. In the measure that human development advances and society\r\nis transformed, religion is transformed along with it. It is, as Marx\r\nputs it, a popular striving after the illusory happiness that\r\ncorresponds with a social condition which needs such an illusion.[209]\r\nThe illusion wanes so soon as real happiness is descried, and the\r\npossibility of its realization penetrates the masses. The ruling classes\r\nendeavor, in their own interest, to prevent this popular conception.\r\nHence they seek to turn religion into a means to preserve their\r\ndomination. The purpose appears fully in their maxim: \"The people must\r\nbe held to religion.\" This particular business becomes an official\r\nfunction in a society that rests upon class rule. A caste is formed that\r\nassumes this function and that turns the whole acumen of their minds\r\ntowards preserving, and enlarging such a social structure, seeing that\r\nthereby their own power and importance are increased.\r\n\r\nStarting in fetishism at low stages of civilization and primitive social\r\nconditions, religion becomes polytheism at a higher, and monotheism at a\r\nstill higher stage. It is not the gods that create men, it is man who\r\nturns the gods into God. \"In the image of himself (man) he created Him\"\r\n(God), not the opposite way. Monotheism has also suffered changes. It\r\nhas dissolved into a pantheism that embraces and permeates the\r\nuniverse--and it volatilizes day by day. Natural science reduced to myth\r\nthe dogma of the creation of the earth in six days; astronomy,\r\nmathematics, physics have converted heaven into a structure of air, and\r\nthe stars, once fastened to the roof of heaven in which angels had their\r\nabodes, into fixed stars and planets whose very composition excludes all\r\nangelic life.\r\n\r\nThe ruling class, finding itself threatened in its existence, clings to\r\nreligion as a prop of all authority, just as every ruling class has done\r\nheretofore.[210] The bourgeoisie or capitalist class itself believes in\r\nnothing. Itself, at every stage of its development and through the\r\nmodern science that sprang from none but its own lap, has destroyed all\r\nfaith in religion and authority. Its faith is only a pretence; and the\r\nChurch accepts the help of this false friend because itself is in need\r\nof help. \"Religion is necessary for the people.\"\r\n\r\nNo such considerations animate Socialistic Society. Human progress and\r\nunadulterated science are its device. If any there be who has religious\r\nneeds, he is free to please himself in the company of those who feel\r\nlike him. It is a matter that does not concern society. Seeing that the\r\nclergyman's own mind will be improved by work, the day will dawn to him\r\nalso when he will realize that _the highest aim is to be man_.\r\n\r\nEthics and morality exist without organized religion. The contrary is\r\nasserted only by weak-minded people or hypocrites. Ethics and morality\r\nare the expression of conceptions that regulate the relations of man to\r\nman, and their mutual conduct. Religion embraces the relations of man\r\nwith supernal beings. And, just as with religion, moral conceptions also\r\nare born of existing social conditions at given times. Cannibals regard\r\nthe eating of human beings as highly moral; Greeks and Romans regarded\r\nslavery as moral; the feudal lord of the Middle Ages regarded serfdom as\r\nmoral; and to-day the modern capitalist considers highly moral the\r\ninstitution of wage-slavery, the flaying of women with night work and\r\nthe demoralization of children by factory labor.[211] Here we have four\r\ndifferent social stages, and as many different conceptions of morality,\r\nand yet in none does the highest moral sense prevail. Undoubtedly the\r\nhighest moral stage is that in which men stand to one another free and\r\nequal; that in which the principle: \"What you do not wish to be done\r\nunto you, do not unto others\" is observed inviolate throughout the\r\nrelations of man to man. In the Middle Ages, the genealogical tree was\r\nthe standard; to-day it is property; in future society, the standard of\r\nman is man. And the future is Socialism in practice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe late Reichstag delegate, Dr. Lasker, delivered, in the seventies, an\r\naddress in Berlin, in which he arrived at the conclusion that an equal\r\nlevel of education for all members of society was possible. Dr. Lasker\r\nwas an anti-Socialist a rigid upholder of private property and of the\r\ncapitalist system of production. The question of education is to-day,\r\nhowever, a question of money. Under such conditions, an equal level of\r\neducation for all is an impossibility. Exceptional persons, situated in\r\nrelatively favorable conditions, may, by dint of overcoming all\r\ndifficulties and by the exertion of great energy, not given to\r\neverybody, succeed in acquiring a higher education. The masses never, so\r\nlong as they live in a state of social oppression.[212]\r\n\r\nIn the new social order, the conditions of existence are equal for all.\r\nWants and inclinations differ, and, differences being grounded in the\r\nvery nature of man, will continue so to be. Each member, however, can\r\nlive and develop under the same favorable conditions that obtain for\r\nall. The uniformity, generally imputed to Socialism, is, as so many\r\nother things, false and nonsensical. Even if Socialism did so wish it,\r\nthe wish were absurd; it would come in conflict with the nature of man;\r\nSocialism would have to give up the idea of seeing society develop\r\naccording to its principles.[213] Aye, even if Socialism were to succeed\r\nin overpowering society and to force upon it unnatural conditions, it\r\nwould not be long before such conditions, felt to be shackles, would be\r\nsnapped, and Socialism would be done for. Society develops out of\r\nitself, according to laws latent in it, and it acts accordingly.[214]\r\n\r\nOne of the principal tasks of the new social system will be the\r\neducation of the rising generation in keeping with its improved\r\nopportunities. Every child that is born, be it male or female, is a\r\nwelcome addition to society. Society sees therein the prospect of its\r\nown perpetuity, of its own further development. It, therefore, also\r\nrealizes the duty of providing for the new being according to its best\r\npowers. The first object of its attention must, consequently, be the one\r\nthat gives birth to the new being--the mother. A comfortable home;\r\nagreeable surroundings and provisions of all sorts, requisite to this\r\nstage of maternity; a careful nursing--such are the first requirements.\r\nThe mother's breast must be preserved for the child as long as possible\r\nand necessary. This is obvious. Moleschott, Sonderegger, all hygienists\r\nand physicians are agreed that nothing can fully substitute the mother's\r\nnourishment.\r\n\r\nPeople who, like Eugen Richter, indignate at the idea of a young mother\r\nbeing placed in a lying-in establishment, where she is surrounded by all\r\nthat to-day is possible only to the very wealthiest, and which even\r\nthese cannot furnish in the fullness attainable at institutions\r\nespecially equipped for the purpose--such people we wish to remind of\r\nthe fact that, to-day, at least four-fifths of the population are born\r\nunder the most primitive circumstances and conditions, that are a\r\ndisgrace to our civilization. Of the remaining one-fifth of our mothers,\r\nonly a minority is able to enjoy the nursing and comforts that should be\r\nbestowed upon a woman in that state. _The fact is that in cities with\r\nexcellent provisions for child-birth--Berlin for instance, and all\r\nUniversity cities--even to-day not a few women resort to such\r\ninstitutions as soon as they feel their time approaching, and await\r\ntheir delivery. Unfortunately, however, the expenses at such\r\ninstitutions are so high, that but few women can use them, while others\r\nare held back by prejudice._ Here again we have an instance of how\r\neverywhere bourgeois society carries in its own lap the germ of the\r\nfuture order.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, maternity among the rich has a unique taste; the maternal\r\nduties are transferred as soon as possible to a _proletarian nurse_. As\r\nis well known, the Wendt Lausitz (Spreewald) is the region that the\r\nwomen of the Berlin bourgeoisie, who are unwilling or unable to nurse\r\ntheir own babies, draw their wet-nurses from. The \"cultivation of\r\nnurses\" is there carried on as a peculiar trade. It consists in the\r\ngirls of the district causing themselves to be impregnated, with the end\r\nin view of being able, after the birth of their own children, to hire\r\nthemselves out as nurses to rich Berlin families. Girls who give birth\r\nto three or four illegitimate children, so as to be able to go out as\r\nnurses, are no rarity; and they are sought after by the males of the\r\nSpreewald according to their earnings in this business. Such a system is\r\nutterly repellant from the view-point of bourgeois morality; from the\r\nview-point of the family interests of the bourgeoisie it is considered\r\npraiseworthy and desirable.\r\n\r\nSo soon as in the society of the future the child has grown up, it falls\r\nin with the other children of its own age for play, and under common\r\nsurveillance. All that can be furnished for its mental and physical\r\nculture is at hand, according to the measure of general intelligence.\r\nWhosoever has watched children knows that they are brought up best in\r\nthe company of their equals, their sense of gregariousness and instinct\r\nof imitation being generally strong. The smaller are strongly inclined\r\nto take the older ones as example, and rather follow them than their own\r\nparents. These qualities can be turned to advantage in education.[215]\r\nThe playgrounds and kindergartens are followed by a playful introduction\r\ninto the preliminaries of knowledge and of the various manual\r\noccupations. This is followed up by agreeable mental and physical work,\r\nconnected with gymnastic exercises and free play in the skating rink and\r\nswimming establishments; drills, wrestling, and exercises for both sexes\r\nfollow and supplement one another. The aim is to raise a healthy, hardy,\r\nphysically and mentally developed race. Step by step follows the\r\ninduction of the youth in the various practical pursuits--manufacturing,\r\nhorticulture, agriculture, the technique of the process of production,\r\netc.; nor is the development of the mind neglected in the several\r\nbranches of science.\r\n\r\nThe same process of \"dusting\" and improvement observed in the system of\r\nproduction, is pursued in that of education; obsolete, superfluous and\r\nharmful methods and subjects are dropped. The knowledge of natural\r\nthings, introduced in a natural way, will spur the desire for knowledge\r\ninfinitely more than a system of education in which one subject is at\r\nodds with another, and each cancels the other, as, for instance, when\r\n\"religion\" is taught on one hand, and on the other natural sciences and\r\nnatural history. The equipment of the school rooms and educational\r\nestablishments is in keeping with the high degree of culture of the new\r\nsocial order. All the means of education and of study, clothing and\r\nsupport are furnished by society; no pupil is at a disadvantage with\r\nanother.[216] That is another chapter at which our \"men of law and\r\norder\" bristle up indignantly.[217] \"The school-house is to be turned\r\ninto barracks; parents are to be deprived of all influence upon their\r\nchildren!\" is the cry of our adversaries. All false! Seeing that in the\r\nfuture society parents will have infinitely more time at their disposal\r\nthan is the case to-day with the large majority--we need but to call\r\nattention to the ten to fifteen hour day of many workingmen in the post\r\noffice, the railroads, the prisons, the police department, and to the\r\ndemands made upon the time of the industrial workers, the small farmers,\r\nmerchants, soldiers, many physicians, etc.--it follows that they will be\r\nable to devote themselves to their children in a measure that is\r\nimpossible to-day. _Moreover, the parents themselves have the regulation\r\nof education in their hands; it is they who determine the measures that\r\nshall be adopted and introduced. We are then living in a thoroughgoing\r\ndemocratic society. The Boards of Education, which will exist, of\r\ncourse, are made up of the parents themselves--men and women--and of\r\nthose following the educational profession._ Does any one imagine they\r\nwill act against their own interests? That happens only to-day when the\r\nState seeks but to enforce its own exclusive interests.\r\n\r\nOur opponents furthermore demean themselves as though to-day one of the\r\ngreatest pleasures of parents was to have their children about them all\r\nday long, and to educate them. It is just the reverse in reality. What\r\nhardships and cares are to-day caused by the education of a child, even\r\nwhen a family has but one of them, those parents are best able to judge\r\nwho are themselves so situated. Several children, in a manner,\r\nfacilitate education, but then again they give rise to so much more\r\ntrouble that their father and especially the mother, who is the one to\r\nbear the heaviest burden, is happy when the school hour arrives, and\r\nthus the house is rid of the children for a portion of the day. Most\r\nparents can afford but a very imperfect education to their children.\r\nThe large majority of fathers and mothers lack time; the former have\r\ntheir business, the latter their household to attend to, and their time\r\nis furthermore taken up with social duties. Even when they actually have\r\ntime, in innumerable instances they lack the ability. How many parents\r\nare able to follow the course of their children's education at school,\r\nand to take them under the arm in their schoolwork at home? Only few.\r\nThe mother, who in most such cases has greater leisure at her disposal,\r\nlacks capacity; she has not herself received sufficient training.\r\nMoreover, the method and the courses of education change so frequently\r\nthat these are strange to the parents.\r\n\r\nAgain, the home facilities are generally so poor that the children enjoy\r\nneither the necessary comfort, nor order, nor quiet to do their\r\nschoolwork at home, or to find there the needed aid. Everything\r\nnecessary is generally wanting. The home is narrow and overcrowded;\r\nsmall and grown-up brothers and sisters move about over that narrow\r\nspace; the furniture is not what it should be, and furnishes no\r\nfacilities to the child for study. Not infrequently light, also air and\r\nheat are wanting; the materials for study and work, if there be any of\r\nthem, are poor; frequently even hunger gnaws at the stomach of the child\r\nand robs it of mind and pleasure for its work. As a supplement to this\r\npicture, the fact must be added that hundreds of thousands of children\r\nare put to all manner of work, domestic and industrial, that embitters\r\ntheir youth and disables them from fulfilling their educational task.\r\nAgain, often do children have to overcome the resistance of\r\nnarrow-minded parents when they try to take time for their schoolwork or\r\nfor play. In short, the obstacles are so numerous that, if they are all\r\ntaken into account, the wonder is the youth of the land is as well\r\neducated. It is an evidence of the health of human nature, and of its\r\ninherent ambition after progress and perfection.\r\n\r\nBourgeois society itself recognizes some of these evils by the\r\nintroduction of public education and by facilitating the same still more\r\nthrough the free supply, here and there, of school material--two things\r\nthat, as late as about the year 1885 the then Minister of Education of\r\nSaxony designated as a \"Social Democratic demand,\" and as such flung the\r\ndesignation in the face of the Socialist Representative in the Landtag.\r\nIn France, where, after long neglect, popular education advanced so much\r\nmore rapidly, progress has gone still further. At least in Paris, the\r\nschool children are fed at public expense. The poor obtain food free,\r\nand the children of parents who are better circumstanced contribute\r\nthereto a slight tax toward the common treasury--a communistic\r\narrangement that has proved satisfactory to parents and children alike.\r\n\r\nAn evidence of the inadequacy of the present school system--it is\r\nunable to fulfil even the moderate demands made upon it--is the fact\r\nthat thousands upon thousands of children _are unable to fulfil their\r\nschool duties by reason of insufficient food_. In the winter of 1893-94,\r\nit was ascertained in Berlin that _in one school district alone 3,600\r\nchildren went to school without breakfast_. In such shocking conditions\r\nthere are hundreds of thousands of children in Germany to-day at certain\r\nseasons of the year. With millions of others the nourishment is utterly\r\ninsufficient. For all these children public alimentation and clothing\r\nalso would be a godsend. A commonwealth that pursued such a policy and\r\nthus, by the systematic nourishing and clothing of the children, would\r\nbring humanity home to them, is not likely to see the sight of\r\n\"penitentiaries.\" Bourgeois society cannot deny the existence of such\r\nmisery, which itself has called forth. Hence we see compassionate souls\r\nforegathering in the establishment of breakfast and soup houses, to the\r\nend of partially filling by means of charity what it were the duty of\r\nsociety to fill in full. Our conditions are wretched--_but still more\r\nwretched is the mental make-up of those who shut their eyes to such\r\nfacts_.\r\n\r\nThe system of reducing so-called home school work, and of having the\r\nsame done at school under the supervision of a teacher is progressing;\r\nthe inadequacy of home facilities is realized. Not only is the richer\r\npupil at an advantage over the poorer by reason of his position, but\r\nalso by reason of his having private teachers and such other assistance\r\nat his command. On the other hand, however, laziness and shiftlessness\r\nare promoted with the rich pupil by reason of the effects of wealth,\r\nluxury and superfluity; these make knowledge appear superfluous to him,\r\nand often they place before him such immoral sights that he easily\r\nslides into temptation. He who every day and every hour hears the\r\npraises sung of rank, position, money, property, and that they are\r\nall-essential, acquires abnormal conceptions regarding man and his\r\nduties, and regarding State and social institutions.\r\n\r\nClosely looked into, bourgeois society has no reason to feel indignant\r\nat the communistic education, which Socialists aim at. Bourgeois society\r\nhas itself partly introduced such a system for the privileged classes,\r\nbut only as a caricature of the original. Look at the cadet and alumni\r\nestablishments, at the seminaries, at the schools for clergymen, and at\r\nthe homes for military orphans. In them many thousands of children,\r\npartly from the so-called upper classes, are educated in a one-sided and\r\nwrongful manner, and in strict cloister seclusion; they are trained for\r\ncertain specific occupations. And again, many members of the better\r\nsituated classes, who live in the country or in small places as\r\nphysicians, clergymen, government employes, factory owners, landlords,\r\nlarge farmers, etc., send their children to boarding schools in the\r\nlarge cities and barely get a glimpse of them, except possibly during\r\nvacations.\r\n\r\nThere is, accordingly, an obvious contradiction between the indignation\r\nexpressed by our adversaries at a communistic system of education and at\r\n\"the estrangement of children from their parents,\" on the one hand, and\r\ntheir own conduct, on the other, in _introducing the identical system\r\nfor their own children--only in a bungling, absolutely false and\r\ninadequate style_.\r\n\r\nIn equal tempo with the increased opportunities for education must the\r\nnumber of teachers increase. In the matter of the education of the\r\nrising generations the new social order must proceed in a way similar to\r\nthat which prevails in the army, in the drilling of soldiers. There is\r\none \"under-officer\" to each eight or ten men. With one teacher to every\r\neight or ten pupils, the future may expect the results that should be\r\naimed at.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of mechanical activities in the best equipped\r\nworkshops, in garden and field work, will constitute a good part of the\r\neducation of the youth. It will all be done with the proper change and\r\nwithout excessive exertion, to the end of reaching the most perfectly\r\ndeveloped beings.\r\n\r\nEducation must also be equal and in common for both sexes. Their\r\nseparation is justifiable only in the cases where the difference in sex\r\nmakes such separation absolutely necessary. In this manner of education\r\nthe United States is far ahead of us. There education of the two sexes\r\nis in common from the primary schools up to the universities. Not only\r\nis education free, but also school materials, inclusive of the\r\ninstruments needed in manual training and in cooking, as also in\r\nchemistry, physics, and the articles needed for experimenting and at\r\nbench-work. To many schools are attached gymnastic halls, bath houses,\r\nswimming basins and playgrounds. In the higher schools, the female sex\r\nis trained in gymnastics, swimming, rowing and marching.[218]\r\n\r\nThe Socialist system of education, properly regulated and ordered and\r\nplaced under the direction of a sufficient force, continues up to the\r\nage when society shall determine that its youth shall enter upon their\r\nmajority. Both sexes are fully qualified to exercise all the rights and\r\nfill all the duties that society demands from its adult members. Society\r\nnow enjoys the certainty of having brought up only thorough, fully\r\ndeveloped members, human beings to whom nothing natural is strange, as\r\nfamiliar with their nature as with the nature and conditions of society\r\nwhich they join full-righted.\r\n\r\nThe daily increasing excesses of our modern youth--all of them the\r\ninevitable consequences of the present tainted and decomposing state of\r\nsociety--will have vanished. Impropriety of conduct, disobedience,\r\nimmorality and rude pleasure-seeking, such as is especially noticeable\r\namong the youth of our higher educational institutions--the gymnasia,\r\npolytechnics, universities, etc.--vices that are incited and promoted by\r\nthe existing demoralization and unrest of domestic life, by the\r\npoisonous influence of social life such as the immoral literature that\r\nwealth procures--all these will likewise have vanished. In equal measure\r\nwill disappear the evil effects of the modern factory system and of\r\nimproper housing, that dissoluteness and self-assurance of youths at an\r\nage when the human being is most in need of reining and education in\r\nself-control. All these evils future society will escape without the\r\nneed of coercive measures. The nature of the social institutions and of\r\nthe mental atmosphere, that will spring from them and that will rule\r\nsociety itself, rendering impossible the breaking out of such evils; as\r\nin Nature disease and the destruction of organisms can appear only when\r\nthere is a state of decay that invites disease; so likewise in society.\r\n\r\nNo one will deny that our present system of instruction and of education\r\nsuffers of serious defects--the higher schools and educational\r\nestablishments even more so than the lower. The village school is a\r\nparagon of moral health compared with the college; common schools for\r\nthe manual training of poor girls are paragons of morality compared with\r\nmany leading boarding schools for girls. The reason is not far to seek.\r\nIn the upper classes of society, every aspiration after higher human\r\naims is smothered; _those classes no longer have any ideal_. As a\r\nconsequence of the absence of ideals and of noble endeavor, an unbounded\r\npassion for physical indulgence and hankering after excesses spread\r\ntheir physical and moral gangrene in all directions. How else can the\r\nyouth be that is brought up in such an atmosphere? Purely material\r\nindulgence, without stint and without bounds, is the only aim that it\r\nsees or knows of. Why exert themselves, if the wealth of their parents\r\nmakes all effort seem superfluous? The maximum of education with a large\r\nmajority of the sons of our bourgeoisie consists in passing the\r\nexaminations for the one year's service in the army. Is this goal\r\nreached, then they imagine to have climbed Pelion and Ossa, and regard\r\nthemselves at least as demi-gods. Have they a reserve officer's\r\ncertificate in their pocket, then their pride and arrogance knows no\r\nlimit. The influence exercised by this generation--a generation it has\r\nbecome by its numbers--weak in the character and knowledge of its\r\nmembers, but strong in their designs and the spirit of graft,\r\ncharacterizes the present period as the \"Age of Reserve Officers.\" Its\r\npeculiarities are: Characterlessness and ignorance, but a strong will;\r\nservility upward, arrogance and brutality downward.\r\n\r\nThe daughters of our bourgeoisie are trained as show-dolls, fools of\r\nfashion and drawingroom-ladies, on the chase after one enjoyment after\r\nanother, until, finally, surfeited with _ennui_, they fall a prey to all\r\nimaginable real and supposed diseases. Grown old, they become devotees\r\nand beads-women, who turn up their eyes at the corruption of the world\r\nand preach asceticism. As regards the lower classes, the effort is on\r\nfoot to lower still more the level of their education. The proletariat\r\nmight become too knowing, it might get tired of its vassalage, and might\r\nrebel against its earthly gods. The more stupid the mass, all the easier\r\nis it to control and rule.\r\n\r\nAnd thus modern society stands before the question of instruction and\r\neducation as bewildered as it stands before all other social questions.\r\nWhat does it? It calls for the rod; preaches \"religion,\" that is,\r\nsubmission and contentment to those who are now but too submissive;\r\nteaches abstinence where, due to poverty, abstinence has become\r\ncompulsory in the utmost necessaries of life. Those who in the rudeness\r\nof their nature rear up brutally are taken to \"reformatories,\" that\r\nusually are controlled by pietistic influences;--and the pedagogic\r\nwisdom of modern society has about reached the end of its tether.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment that the rising generation in future society shall have\r\nreached its majority, all further growth is left to the individual:\r\nsociety will feel sure that each will seize the opportunity to unfold\r\nthe germs that have been so far developed in him. Each does according as\r\ninclination and faculties serve him. Some choose one branch of the ever\r\nmore brilliant natural sciences: anthropology, zoology, botany,\r\nmineralogy, geology, physics, chemistry, prehistoric sciences, etc.;\r\nothers take to the science of history, philologic researches, art;\r\nothers yet become musicians from special gifts, or painters, or\r\nsculptors, or actors. The future will have \"guild artists\" as little as\r\n\"guild scientists\" or \"guild artisans.\" Thousands of brilliant talents,\r\nhitherto kept down, unfold and assert themselves and display their\r\nknowledge and ability wherever opportunity offers. No longer are there\r\nany musicians, actors, artists and scientists by profession; they will\r\nexist only by inspiration, talent and genius; and the achievements of\r\nthese bid fair to excel modern achievements on these fields as vastly as\r\nthe industrial, technical and agricultural achievements of future\r\nsociety are certain to excel those of to-day. An era of art and sciences\r\nwill spring up such as the world never saw before; nor will its\r\ncreations fail to correspond to such a _renaissance_.\r\n\r\nWhat transformation and new-birth science will experience when\r\nconditions shall have become worthy of the human race, no less a man\r\nthan the late Richard Wagner foresaw and expressed as early as 1850 in\r\nhis work \"Art and Revolution.\" This work is all the more significant\r\nseeing that it made its appearance immediately after a revolution that\r\nhad just been beaten down, that Wagner took part in, and by reason of\r\nwhich he had to flee from Dresden. In this book Wagner foretells what\r\nthe future will bring on. He turns directly to the working class as the\r\none called upon to emancipate true art. Among other things he says:\r\n\r\n\"When, with the free human race of the future, the earning of a living\r\nshall no longer be the object of life; when, on the contrary, thanks to\r\nthe rise of a new faith, or of higher knowledge, the gaining of a\r\nlivelihood by means of compatible work shall be raised above all\r\nuncertainty;--in short, when industry shall no longer be our master but\r\nour servant, then will we place the object of life in the pleasure of\r\nlife, and seek to make our children fit and worthy through education. An\r\neducation that starts from the exercise of strength, from the care of\r\nthe beauty of the body will, due to the undisturbed love for the child\r\nand to the joy experienced at the thriving of its charms, become purely\r\nartistic; and thus in some sense or another every being will be an\r\nartist in truth. The diversity of natural inclinations will develop the\r\nmost manifold aptitudes into an unprecedented wealth of beauty!\"--at all\r\npoints a Socialist line of thought, and fully in keeping with the\r\narguments herein made.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSocial life in future will be ever more public. What the trend is may be\r\ngathered from the wholly changed position of woman, compared with former\r\ntimes. Domestic life will be confined to what is absolutely necessary,\r\nwhile the widest field will be opened to the gratification of the social\r\ninstincts. Large gathering places for the holding of addresses and\r\ndiscussions, and for conferring upon all social questions, over which\r\nthe collectivity has the sovereign word; play, meal and reading rooms;\r\nlibraries, concert halls and theaters; museums and gymnastic\r\ninstitutions; parks, promenades, public baths, educational institutions\r\nof all sorts; laboratories, etc.;--all of these, erected in the best and\r\nequipped in the fittest manner possible, will afford richest opportunity\r\nfor all manner of intercourse, of art and of science to achieve the\r\nhighest. Likewise will the institutions for the nursing of the sick, the\r\nweak, the infirm through old age, meet the highest demands.\r\n\r\nHow little will then our much boasted about age seem in comparison.\r\nThis fawning for favor and sunshine from above; this cringing and\r\ndog-like frame of mind; this mutual struggle of enviousness, with the\r\naid of the most hateful and vilest means, for the privileged place. All\r\nalong the suppression of convictions; the veiling of good qualities,\r\nthat might otherwise give offence; the emasculation of character; the\r\naffectation of opinions and feelings;--in short, all those qualities\r\nthat may be summed up in words \"cowardice and characterlessness\" are now\r\nevery day more pronounced. Whatever elevates and ennobles\r\nman--self-esteem, independence and incorruptibility of opinion and\r\nconvictions, freedom of utterance--modern conditions generally turn into\r\ndefects and crimes. Often do these qualities work the ruin of their\r\nowners, unless he suppresses them. Many do not even realize their\r\ndegradation; they have grown accustomed thereto. The dog regards it a\r\nmatter of course that he has a master, who, when out of temper, visits\r\nhim with the whip.\r\n\r\nSuch altered conditions in social life will impart a radically different\r\naspect to literary productions. Theological literature, whose entries\r\nare at present most numerous in the yearly catalogues of literary works,\r\ndrops out in company with its juridic cousin,--there is no more interest\r\nin the former, and no more use for the latter. All the literary\r\nproductions that refer to the struggle over political institutions will\r\nbe seen no more,--their subject-matter has ceased to be. The study of\r\nall such matters will belong to the history of civilization. The vast\r\nmass of inane productions--the evidences of a spoiled taste, often\r\npossible only through sacrifices at the altar of the author's\r\nvanity--are gone. Even speaking from the view-point of present\r\nconditions, it may be said without exaggeration that four-fifths of all\r\nliterary productions could disappear from the market without loss to a\r\nsingle interest of civilization. Such is the vastness of the mass of\r\nsuperficial or harmful books, palpable trash, extant to-day on the field\r\nof literature.\r\n\r\nBelles-lettres and the press will be equally hit. There is nothing\r\nsorrier, more spiritless or superficial than the large majority of our\r\nnewspaper literature. If our stage in civilization and scientific\r\nattainments were to be gauged by the contents of that set of papers, it\r\nwould be low indeed. The actions of men and the condition of things are\r\njudged from a view-point that corresponds with centuries gone by, and\r\nthat has been long since proved laughable and untenable by science. A\r\nconsiderable portion of our journalists are people who, as Bismarck once\r\nput it, \"missed their calling,\" but whose education and standard of\r\nwages fit with bourgeois interests. Furthermore, these newspapers, as\r\nwell as the majority of the belles-lettric magazines, have the mission\r\nof circulating impure advertisements; the interests of their purses are\r\non this field the same as on the former: the material interests of\r\ntheir owners determine their contents.\r\n\r\nOn an average, belles-lettric literature is not much superior to\r\nnewspaper literature. Its forte is to cultivate sex excesses: it renders\r\nhomage either to shallow enlightenment or to stale prejudices and\r\nsuperstitions. Its general purpose is to represent the capitalist order\r\nof society, all its shortcomings notwithstanding, which are conceded in\r\ntrifles, as the best of all possible worlds.\r\n\r\nOn this extensive and important field, future society will institute\r\nsome thorough-going housecleaning. Science, truth, beauty, the contest\r\nof the intellect after the best will rule supreme. Everyone who achieves\r\nwhat is worthy will enjoy the opportunity to exercise his faculties. He\r\nno longer depends upon the favor of a publisher, moneyed considerations\r\nor prejudice, but only upon the impartial judgment of experts whom he\r\nhimself joins in electing, and from whose unfavorable decision he can\r\nalways appeal to the general vote of the whole community,--all of which\r\nis to-day against him or impossible. The childish notion that all\r\ncontest of intellect would be held down in a Socialist society they\r\nalone can maintain who hold the bourgeois world to be the most perfect\r\nsocial system, and who, out of enmity to Socialism seek to slander and\r\nto belittle it. A society, that rests upon full democratic equality,\r\nneither knows nor tolerates oppression. Only the fullest freedom of\r\nthought makes uninterrupted progress possible, and this is the principle\r\nof life with society. Moreover, it is an act of deception to represent\r\nbourgeois society as the paladin of true freedom of thought. Parties\r\nthat represent class interests will publish in the press only that which\r\ndoes not injure their class' own interests, and woe to him who would\r\nattempt the contrary. His social ruin would be sealed, as every one\r\nknows. In what manner publishers handle literary work that does not suit\r\nthem, every writer almost could tell a tale of woe on. Finally, the\r\nGerman press and criminal laws betray the spirit that animates our\r\nruling and leading classes. Actual freedom of thought is looked upon by\r\nthem as the most dangerous of evils.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe individual is to develop himself fully. That must be the law of\r\nhuman association. Accordingly, the individual may not remain fettered\r\nto the soil on which the accident of birth first placed him. Men and the\r\nworld should be known, not from books and papers only: personal\r\nobservation, practical experience are also needed. Accordingly, future\r\nsociety must enable everyone to do what is now done by many, although in\r\nmost instances it happens to-day under the whip that want cracks. The\r\nwish for change in all the relations of life is a craving strongly\r\nstamped in man. It springs from the instinct after perfection, inherent\r\nin all organic beings. The plant that stands in a dark room, stretches\r\nand strains, as though endowed with consciousness, towards the light\r\nthat falls from some crevice. Just so with man. An instinct implanted in\r\nman, consequently a natural instinct, must be rationally gratified. The\r\nconditions of future society will not balk the instinct after change; on\r\nthe contrary, they promote its gratification with all: it is facilitated\r\nby the highly developed system of intercommunication; it is demanded by\r\ninternational relations. In future days, infinitely more people will\r\ntravel through the world, and for the most varied of purposes, than\r\nhappens to-day.\r\n\r\nIn order to meet all demands, society furthermore requires an ample\r\nprovision of all the necessaries of life. Society regulates its hours of\r\nwork accordingly. It makes them longer or shorter, according as its\r\nneeds or the season of the year may suggest. It may turn its strength at\r\none season mainly to agriculture, at another mainly to industrial and\r\nsimilar production. It directs its labor forces as occasion may require.\r\nThrough the combination of numerous forces, equipped with the best\r\ntechnical provisions, it can carry through with swiftness, aye,\r\nplayingly, undertakings that to-day seem impossible.\r\n\r\nAs society assumes the care of its youth, so it does of its aged, sick\r\nor invalid members. It guards whoever, by whatever circumstance, has\r\nbecome unable to work. There is in this no question of _charity_, but of\r\n_duty_; not of an alms morsel, but of an assistance born of every\r\npossible consideration due him, who, during the time of his strength and\r\nability to work, fulfilled his duties to the commonwealth. The setting\r\nsun of old age is beautiful with all that society can offer: everyone\r\nbeing buoyed up with the confidence that he will some day himself enjoy\r\nwhat now he affords to others. No longer are the aged now disturbed with\r\nthe thought that others are awaiting their death in order to \"inherit;\"\r\nlikewise has the fear vanished from the mind of man that, grown old and\r\nhelpless, he will be cast off like a squeezed lemon. Man now feels\r\nhimself left neither to the benevolence of his children, nor to the alms\r\nof the community. What the condition is in which most parents find\r\nthemselves, who depend in old age upon the support of their children, is\r\nnotorious. How demoralizing is not the effect of the hope of inheriting\r\nupon the children, and, in a still greater degree, upon relatives! What\r\nvile qualities are not awakened; and how many are not the crimes that\r\nsuch hopes have led to!--murder, forgery, perjury, extortion, etc.\r\nCapitalist society has no reason to be proud of its laws of\r\ninheritance; to them are ascribable part of the crimes that are\r\ncommitted every year; and yet the large majority of people have nothing\r\nto bequeath or to inherit.[219]\r\n\r\nThe moral and physical condition of future society; the nature of its\r\nwork, homes, food, clothing, its social life--everything will greatly\r\ncontribute to avoid accidents, sickness, debility. Natural death by the\r\ndecline of the vigor of life will become the rule. The conviction that\r\n\"heaven\" is on earth, and that to be dead means to be ended, will cause\r\npeople to lead rational lives.[220] He enjoys most who enjoys longest.\r\nNone know how to appreciate a long life better than the very clergy who\r\nprepare people for the \"after world;\" a life free from care makes it\r\npossible for these gentlemen to reach the highest age average.[221]\r\n\r\nLife requires, first of all, food and drink. Friends of the so-called\r\n\"natural way of living\" often ask why is Socialism indifferent to\r\nvegetarianism. The question causes us to take up the subject in a few\r\nlines. Vegetarianism, that is, the doctrine that prescribes an exclusive\r\nvegetal diet, found its first supporters in such circles as are in the\r\nagreeable position of being able to choose between a vegetal and an\r\nanimal diet. To the large majority of people there is no such choice:\r\nthey are forced to live according to their means, the meagerness of\r\nwhich in many instances keeps them almost exclusively to a vegetal diet,\r\nand to the least nutritive, at that. With our working class population\r\nin Silesia, Saxony, Thuringen, etc., the potato is the principal\r\nnourishment; even bread comes in only secondarily; meat, and then only\r\nof poor quality, is hardly ever seen on the table. Even the largest part\r\nof the rural population, although they are the raisers of cattle, rarely\r\npartake of meat: they must sell the cattle in order to satisfy other\r\npressing wants with the money obtained therefor.\r\n\r\nFor the innumerable people, who are compelled to live as vegetarians, an\r\noccasional solid beefsteak, or good leg of mutton, would be a decided\r\nimprovement in the diet. When vegetarianism directs itself against the\r\noverrating of the nutrition contained in meat, it is right; it is wrong,\r\nhowever, when it combats the partaking of meat as harmful and fatal,\r\nmainly on sentimental grounds--such as \"the nature of man forbids the\r\nkilling of animals and to partake of a corpse.\" In order to live\r\ncomfortably and undisturbed, we are compelled to declare war upon and\r\ndestroy a large number of living beings in the shape of all manner of\r\nvermin; in order not to be ourselves eaten up, we must undertake the\r\nkilling and extirpating of wild animals. The quiet toleration of those\r\n\"good friends of man,\" the domestic animals, would increase the number\r\nof these \"good friends\" in a few decades so immensely that they would\r\n\"devour\" us by robbing us of food. Neither is the claim true that a\r\nvegetarian diet produces mildness of temperament. The \"beast\" was\r\nawakened even in the mild, vegetarian Hindoo when the severity of the\r\nEnglishmen drove him to mutiny.\r\n\r\nIn our opinion Sonderegger hits the nail on the head when he says:\r\n\"There is no order of rank in the matter of the different kinds of food;\r\nbut there is an unalterable law in the matter of combining their several\r\nnutritious qualities.\" It is true that no one can nourish himself on an\r\nexclusively meat diet, but that he can on an exclusively vegetal diet,\r\nprovided always he can select to suit; but neither would any one be\r\nsatisfied with one vegetable, let it be the most nutritive. Beans, for\r\ninstance, peas, lentils, in short, the leguminosae, are the most\r\nnutritive of all food. Nevertheless, to be forced to feed exclusively on\r\nthem--which is said to be possible--were a torture. Karl Marx mentions\r\nin \"Capital\" that the Chilian mine-owners compel their workingmen to eat\r\nbeans year in and year out, because the food imparts to them great\r\nstrength and enables them to carry burdens that they could not carry\r\nwith any other diet. Despite its nutrition, the workingmen turn against\r\nsuch food, but get none other, and are thus obliged to rest content\r\ntherewith. Under no circumstances do the happiness and well-being of\r\npeople depend upon a certain diet, as is claimed by the fanatics among\r\nthe vegetarians. Climate, custom, individual tastes are the determining\r\nfactors.\r\n\r\nIn the measure that civilization advances, a vegetal diet progressively\r\ntakes the place of the exclusive meat diet, such as is indulged in by\r\nhunting and pastoral peoples. A many-sided agriculture is a sign of\r\nhigher culture. On a given field, vegetal nutritive matter can be raised\r\nin larger quantities than could meat be obtained through cattle raising.\r\nThis development imparts to vegetal nutrition an ever greater\r\npreponderance. The transportation of meat, that the modern vandalic\r\neconomic system furnishes us with from foreign lands, especially from\r\nSouth America and Australia, has been very nearly exhausted within few\r\ndecades. On the other hand, animals are raised, not merely for the sake\r\nof meat, but also for that of wool, hair, bristles, skin and hides,\r\nmilk, eggs, etc., upon which many industries and human wants are\r\ndependent. Again offal of several kinds can be turned in no way to\r\nbetter advantage than through cattle raising. The seas will also in\r\nfuture be made to yield to man their wealth of animal food to a much\r\nlarger extent than now. It will be in future a rare occurrence to see,\r\nas we do to-day, whole loads of fish turned to manure, because the\r\nfacilities and costs of transportation, or the facilities of\r\npreservation prevent their being otherwise used. It follows that a\r\npurely vegetal diet is neither probable nor necessary in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of food, _quality_ rather than _quantity_ is to be\r\nconsidered. Quantity is of little use if not good. Quality is greatly\r\nimproved by the manner of preparation. The preparation of food must be\r\nconducted as scientifically as any other function, if it is to reach the\r\nhighest point of utility possible. Knowledge and equipment are thereto\r\nrequisite. That our women, upon whom to-day mainly devolves the\r\npreparation of food, do not and can not possess this knowledge, needs no\r\nproof. They lack all the necessary equipments therefor. As every well\r\nequipped hotel kitchen, the steam kitchen of barracks or of hospitals\r\nand especially the cooking expositions teach us, the cooking\r\napparatuses, together with many technical arrangements for all manner of\r\nfood preparation, have reached a high degree of perfection and have been\r\ncontrived upon scientific principles. That will in the future be the\r\nrule. The object aimed at must be to obtain the best results with the\r\nsmallest expenditure of power, time and material. _The small private\r\nkitchen is, just like the workshop of the small master mechanic, a\r\ntransition stage, an arrangement by which time, power and material are\r\nsenselessly squandered and wasted._ The preparation of food also will\r\nin future society be a social establishment, conducted on the most\r\nimproved plane, in proper and advantageous manner. The private kitchen\r\ndisappears, as it has now disappeared in the instance of those families\r\nwho, although they generally provide themselves through their own\r\nkitchen, always resort to hotel kitchens or to those of caterers, the\r\nmoment the question is to provide for banquets or to procure dishes a\r\nknowledge of which both they and their domestics lack.[222]\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Exposition of 1893 brought out a mass of interesting facts\r\non the revolution that has taken place in the kitchen also, and in the\r\npreparation of food;--among other things a kitchen in which the heating\r\nand cooking was done wholly through electricity. Electricity not only\r\nfurnished the light, but was also active in the washing of dishes, which\r\nthereupon required the aid of the human hand only in finishing up. In\r\nthis kitchen of the future there was no hot air, no smoke, no vapors.\r\nNumberless apparatuses and subsidiary machinery performed a number of\r\noperations that until then had to be performed by human hands. This\r\nkitchen of the future resembled more a parlor than a kitchen that\r\neveryone who has nothing to do in, likes to stay away from. Work therein\r\nat the Chicago Exposition was pleasurable and free from all the\r\nunpleasantness that are features of the modern kitchen. Can a private\r\nkitchen be imagined even approximately equipped like that? And then,\r\nwhat a saving in all directions through such a central kitchen! Our\r\nwomen would seize the opportunity with both hands to exchange the\r\npresent for the kitchen of the future.\r\n\r\nThe nutritive value of food is heightened by its facility of\r\nassimilation. This is a determining factor.[223] A natural system of\r\nnourishment for all can be reached only by future society. Cato praises\r\nthe Rome of before his days for having had experts in the art of\r\nhealing, but, down to the sixth century of the city, no occupation for\r\nexclusive physicians. People lived so frugally and simply, that disease\r\nwas rare, and death from old age was the usual form of decease. Not\r\nuntil gourmandizing and idleness--in short, license with some, want and\r\nexcessive work with others--had permeated society, did matters change,\r\nand radically so. In future, gluttony and license will be impossible,\r\nand likewise want, misery and privation. There is enough, and an\r\nabundance, for all. More than fifty years ago Henrich Heine sang:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Why, there grows down here abundance\r\n      And a plentitude for all;\r\n    Roses, myrtles, beauty and joy;\r\n      Yes, and sugar beans withal--\r\n\r\n    Aye, sugar beans in bursting pods\r\n      For everyone are here,\r\n    But they're left to heaven's angels\r\n      And the sparrows of the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"He who eats little lives well\"--that is, long, said the Italian Cornaro\r\nin the sixteenth century, as quoted by Niemeyer. In the end chemistry\r\nwill be active in the preparation and improvement of nourishment to a\r\ndegree thitherto unknown. To-day the science is greatly abused in the\r\ninterest of adulterations and fraud. It is obvious that a chemically\r\nprepared food that has all the qualities of the natural product will\r\naccomplish the same purpose. The form of the preparation is of secondary\r\nimportance, provided the product otherwise meets all requirements.\r\n\r\nAs in the kitchen, the revolution will be accomplished throughout\r\ndomestic life: it will remove numberless details of work that must be\r\nattended to to-day. As in the future the domestic kitchen is rendered\r\nwholly superfluous by the central institutions for the preparation of\r\nfood, so likewise are all the former troubles of keeping ranges, lamps,\r\netc., in working order, removed by the central heating and electric\r\napparatuses for lighting. Warm and cold water supplies place bathing\r\nwithin the reach of all at pleasure, and without the aid of any person.\r\nThe central laundries assume the washing, drying, etc., of clothes; the\r\ncentral cleaning establishments see to the dusting, etc., of clothing\r\nand carpets. In Chicago, carpet-cleaning machines were exhibited that\r\ndid the work in so short a time as to call forth the admiration of the\r\nladies who visited the Exposition. The electric door opens at a slight\r\npressure of the finger, and shuts of itself. Electric contrivances\r\ndeliver letters and newspapers on all the floors of the houses; electric\r\nelevators save the climbing of stairs. The inside arrangement of the\r\nhouses--floorings, garnishing of the walls, furnitures--will be\r\ncontrived with an eye to the facility of cleaning and to the prevention\r\nof the gathering of dust and bacteria. Dust, sweepings and offal of all\r\nsorts will be carried by pipes out of the houses as water, that has\r\nbeen used, is carried off to-day. In the United States, in many a\r\nEuropean city--Zurich, for instance--there are to-day tenements,\r\nexquisitely equipped, in which numerous affluent families--others could\r\nnot bear the expense--live and enjoy a large part of the conveniences\r\njust sketched.\r\n\r\nHere again we have an illustration of how capitalist society breaks the\r\nway in revolutionizing human affairs, in this instance in domestic\r\nlife,--but only for its elect. Domestic life being thus radically\r\ntransformed, the servant, this \"slave of all the whims of the mistress,\"\r\nis no more,--and the mistress neither. \"No servants, no culture!\" cries\r\nthe horrified Herr v. Treitschke with comic pathos. He can as little\r\nimagine society without servants as Aristotle could without slaves. The\r\nmatter of surprise is that Herr v. Treitschke looks upon our servants as\r\nthe \"carriers of civilization.\" Treitschke, like Eugen Richter, is\r\nfurthermore greatly worried by the shoe-polishing and clothes-dusting\r\nquestion, which neither is able to attend to personally. It so happens,\r\nhowever, that with nine-tenths of the people everyone sees to that\r\nhimself, or the wife does for her husband, or a daughter or son for the\r\nfamily. We might answer that what the nine-tenths have hitherto done,\r\nthe remnant tenth may also do. But there is another way out. Why should\r\nnot in future society the youth of the land, without distinction of sex,\r\nbe enlisted for such necessary work? Work does not dishonor, even if it\r\nconsist in polishing boots. Many a member of the old nobility, and\r\nofficers of the army at that, learned the lesson when, to escape their\r\ndebts, they ran off to the United States, and there became servants, or\r\nshoe-polishers. Eugen Richter, in his pamphlets, goes even so far as to\r\ncause the downfall of the \"Socialist Imperial Chancellor\" on the\r\n\"Shoe-polishing Question,\" and the consequent falling to pieces of the\r\n\"Socialist State.\" The \"Socialist Imperial Chancellor\" refuses to polish\r\nhis own shoes; hence his troubles. The bourgeoisie has hugely enjoyed\r\nthis description of Richter, and it has thereby furnished evidence of\r\nthe modesty of its demands upon a criticism of Socialism. But Eugen\r\nRichter lived to experience the sorrow of not only seeing one of his own\r\nparty members in Nuerenberg invent a shoe-polishing machine soon after\r\nthe appearance of that pamphlet, but of also learning that at the\r\nChicago Exposition of 1893 an electric shoe-polishing machine was\r\nexhibited that did the work perfectly. Thus the principal objection,\r\nraised by Richter and Treitschke against Socialist society, has been\r\npractically thrown overboard by an invention made under the bourgeois\r\nsocial system itself.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary transformation, that radically changes all the\r\nrelations of man, especially the position of woman, is, as we see, going\r\non now under our own eyes. It is only a question of time when society\r\nwill take the process into its own hands and upon a large scale, thus\r\nquickening and perfecting the change and affording to all, without\r\nexception, the opportunity to share its innumerable advantages.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[176] \"The power of emulation, in exciting to the most strenuous\r\nexertions for the sake of the approbation and admiration of others, is\r\nborne witness to by experience in every situation in which human beings\r\npublicly compete with one another, even if it be in things frivolous, or\r\nfrom which the public derives no benefit. A contest, who can do most for\r\nthe common good, is not the kind of competition which Socialists\r\nrepudiate.\"--John Stuart Mill's \"Principles of Political Economy.\" Every\r\nunion, every association of people, who pursue equal aims, likewise\r\nfurnishes numerous examples of greater effort with no material, but only\r\nan ideal, reward in view. The emulators are moved by the ambition to\r\ndistinguish themselves, by the desire to serve the common cause. But\r\nthis sort of ambition is no vice; it is a virtue; it is put forth in the\r\ninterest of all; and the individual finds his satisfaction in that along\r\nwith all others. Ambition is harmful and objectionable only when it is\r\nput forth to the injury of the whole, and at the expense of others.\r\n\r\n[177] Von Thuenen says in his \"Der isolirte Staat\": \"The reason why the\r\nproletarians, on the one hand, and property classes, on the other, face\r\neach other permanently as enemies lies in the antagonism of their\r\ninterests; and they will remain unreconciled _so long as this division\r\nof interests is not removed_. Not only the well-being of his wage-giver\r\nbut--through discoveries in industry, the pavement of streets and\r\nbuilding of railroads, the forming of new business connections--the\r\nrevenues of the Nation also may increase. Under our present social\r\norder, however, the workingman is touched by none of these; his\r\ncondition remains what it was, and _the whole increase of revenues\r\naccrues to the employers, the capitalists and the landlords_.\" This last\r\nsentence is an almost literal anticipation of the words of Gladstone in\r\nthe English Parliament, when he declared in 1864 \"this intoxicating\r\nincrease of incomes and power\" that England had experienced in the\r\ncourse of the previous twenty years, \"has been confined exclusively to\r\nthe possessing classes.\" Again on p. 207 of his work, v. Thuenen says:\r\n\"The evil lies in the divorce of the workingman from his product.\"\r\n\r\nMorelly declares in his \"Principles of Legislation\": \"Property divides\r\nus into two classes--Rich and Poor. The former love their property and\r\ncare not to defend the State; the latter can not possibly love the\r\nFatherland, seeing that it bestows upon them naught but misery. Under\r\nthe system of Communism, however, all love the Fatherland, seeing that\r\nall receive from it life and happiness.\"\r\n\r\n[178] In weighing the advantages and the disadvantages of Communism,\r\nJohn Stuart Mill says in his \"Principles of Political Economy\": \"No soil\r\ncould be more favorable to the growth of such a feeling, than a\r\nCommunist association, since all the ambition, and the bodily and mental\r\nactivity, which are now exerted in the pursuit of separate and\r\nself-regarding interests, would require another sphere of employment,\r\nand would naturally find it in the pursuit of the general benefit of the\r\ncommunity.\"\r\n\r\n[179] \"Die Gesetze der sozialen Entwickelung.\"\r\n\r\n[180] What does Herr Eugene Richter say to this calculation? In his\r\n\"Irrelehren\" (False Doctrines) he makes merry over the enormous\r\nshortening of the hours of work that we have held out in this work as\r\nthe result that would follow upon the obligation of all to work and upon\r\nthe higher technical organization of the process of production. He seeks\r\nto minimize as much as possible the productivity of production on a\r\nlarge scale, and to enhance the importance of production on a small\r\nscale. He does so in order that he might claim that the expected\r\nincreased production was not practicable. In order to make Socialism\r\nseem impossible, these defenders of the existing \"order\" are forced to\r\ndiscredit the merits of their own social system.\r\n\r\n[181] \"Capital is said by a Quarterly Reviewer to fly turbulence and\r\nstrife, and to be timid, which is very true; but this is very\r\nincompletely stating the question. Capital eschews no profit, or very\r\nsmall profit, just as Nature was formerly said to abhor a vacuum. With\r\nadequate profit, capital is very bold. A certain 10 per cent. will\r\nensure its employment anywhere; 20 per cent. certain will produce\r\neagerness; 50 per cent. positive audacity; 100 per cent. will made it\r\nready to trample on all human laws; 300 per cent., and there is not a\r\ncrime at which it will scruple, nor a risk it will not run, even to the\r\nchance of its owner being hanged. If turbulence and strife will bring a\r\nprofit, it will freely encourage both. Smuggling and the slave-trade\r\nhave amply proved all that is here stated.\" (P. J. Dunning, 1. c., p.\r\n35.) Cited by Karl Marx in \"Capital,\" p. 786, edition Swan-Sonnenscheim\r\n& Co., London, 1896.\r\n\r\n[182] A competitor with electricity, applied to lighting purposes, has\r\nrecently arisen in the shape of the so-called acetylene gas, which was\r\ndiscovered in the United States, by means of an electrolytic process,\r\nsimilar to that used in the preparation of aluminum. A compound is made\r\nof calcium and carbon, called calcium-carbide, which, in touch with\r\nwater, produces the acetylene gas. Its lighting power is fifteen times\r\nthat of the ordinary illuminating gas, besides being much cheaper.\r\n\r\n[183] \"The generality of laborers in this and most other countries, have\r\nas little choice of occupation or freedom of locomotion, are practically\r\nas dependent on fixed rules, and on the will of others, as they could be\r\non any system short of actual slavery.\"--John Stuart Mill's \"Principles\r\nof Political Economy.\"\r\n\r\n[184] \"A French workman, on his return from San Francisco, writes as\r\nfollows: 'I never could have believed that I was capable of working at\r\nthe various occupations I was employed on in California. I was firmly\r\nconvinced that I was fit for nothing but letter-press printing.... Once\r\nin the midst of this world of adventurers, who change their occupation\r\nas often as they do their shirt, egad, I did as the others. As mining\r\ndid not turn out remunerative enough, I left it for the town, where in\r\nsuccession I became typographer, slater, plumber, etc. In consequence of\r\nthis finding out that I am fit for any sort of work, I feel less of a\r\nmollusk and more of a man.'\" (A. Courbou, \"De l'Enseignement\r\nProfessional,\" 2eme ed. p. 50.) Cited by Karl Marx in \"Capital\", p. 493,\r\nedition Swan-Sonnenschein Co., London, 1896.\r\n\r\n[185] Tolstoi's \"The Significance of Science and Art.\"\r\n\r\n[186] What may be made of a man under favorable circumstances is\r\nillustrated by Leonardo da Vinci, who was a distinguished painter,\r\ncelebrated sculptor, favorite architect and engineer, excellent builder\r\nof fortifications, musician and improvisator. Benvenuto Cellini was a\r\ncelebrated goldsmith, excellent molder, good sculptor, leading builder\r\nof fortifications, first-rate soldier and thorough musician. Abraham\r\nLincoln was a splitter of rails, agriculturist, boatman, shop-assistant\r\nand lawyer, until he was placed in the Presidential chair of the United\r\nStates. It may be said without exaggerating, most people are engaged in\r\noccupations that do not correspond with their faculties, simply because,\r\nnot freedom of choice, but the force of necessity dictated their career.\r\nMany a bad professor would do good work as a shoemaker, and many a good\r\nshoemaker could be a good professor as well.\r\n\r\n[187] It should always be kept in mind that production is then organized\r\nup to the highest point of technical perfection, and all the people are\r\nat work. It may thus happen that, under given circumstances, a\r\nthree-hour day is rather longer, and not shorter, than necessary. Owen\r\nin his time--first quarter of the nineteenth century--considered two\r\nhours' work sufficient.\r\n\r\n[188] \"It is not necessary to go a round-about way in order to ascertain\r\nthe amount of social labor crystallized in a given product. Daily\r\nexperience shows directly the requisite average. Society can easily\r\ncalculate how many hours are contained in a steam engine, in a\r\nhectoliter of last year's wheat, in a hundred square meters of cloth of\r\na certain quality. Society will, therefore, never dream of re-expressing\r\nthese units of work,--crystallized in the products and known to it\r\ndirectly and absolutely--by a merely relative, varying and insufficient\r\nmeasure, formerly used by it as a make-shift that it could not get along\r\nwithout; a measure, moreover, which itself is a third product, instead\r\nof by their natural, adequate and absolute measure--time.... Society\r\nwill have to organize the plan of production according to the means of\r\nproduction, under which category labor-power especially belongs. The\r\nvarious utilities of the several articles of use, balanced with one\r\nanother and with the amount of labor necessary for their production,\r\nwill in the end determine the plan. People settle matters a good deal\r\nmore simply without the intervention of the celebrated 'money\r\nvalue.'\"--Fr. Engels' \"Herr Eugene Duehring's Umwaelzung der\r\nWissensehaft.\"\r\n\r\n[189] Herr Eugene Richter is so astonished at the dropping away of money\r\nin Socialist society--abolished money will not be: with the abolition of\r\nthe merchandise character from the products of labor, money drops away\r\nof itself--that he devotes to the subject a special chapter in his\r\n\"Irrelehren.\" What is particularly hard for him to understand is the\r\nidea that it is immaterial whether the voucher for labor performance be\r\na piece of paper, gold or tin. On this head he says: \"With gold, the\r\ndevil of the modern social order would re-enter the Social Democratic\r\nState\"--that there could then be only a Socialist society, and not a\r\nSocial Democratic State, Herr Richter stubbornly overlooks: he must,\r\nelse a good portion of his polemic would fall through--\"seeing that gold\r\nhas an independent metal value, can be easily saved, and thus the\r\npossession of gold pieces would enable the heaping up of values\r\nwherewith to purchase escape from the obligation to work, and wherewith\r\neven to lay out money on interest.\"\r\n\r\nHerr Richter must take his readers for great blockheads to dare dish up\r\nsuch trash to them on the subject of our gold. Herr Richter, who can not\r\nrid himself of the concept of capital, can, of course, not understand\r\nthat where there is no capital, neither is there any merchandise, nor\r\ncan there be any \"money\"; and where there is no \"capital\" and no\r\n\"money\", neither could there be any \"interest.\" Herr Richter is nailed\r\nso fast to the concept of capital that he is unable to conceive a world\r\nwithout \"capital.\" We should like to know how a member of a Socialist\r\nsociety could \"save up\" his gold certificates of labor, or even loan\r\nthem out to others and thereby rake in interest, when all other members\r\npossess what that one is offering them and--_on which he lives_.\r\n\r\n[190] \"All people of average healthy build _are born with almost equal\r\nintellectual powers, but education, laws and circumstances alter them\r\nrelatively_. The correctly understood interest of the individual is\r\nblended into one with the common or public interest.\"--Helvetius' \"On\r\nMan and His Education.\" Helvetius is right with regard to the large\r\nmajority of people; but that does not take away that the natural\r\nfaculties of each are different for different occupations.\r\n\r\n[191] \"If, therefore, the choice were to be made between Communism with\r\nall its chances, and the present state of society with all its\r\nsufferings and injustices; if the institution of private property\r\nnecessarily carried with it as a consequence, that the produce of labor\r\nshould be apportioned as we now see it, almost in an inverse ratio to\r\nthe labor--the largest portions to those who have never worked at all,\r\nthe next largest to those whose work is almost nominal, and so in a\r\ndescending scale, the remuneration dwindling as the work grows harder\r\nand more disagreeable, until the most fatiguing and exhausting bodily\r\nlabor cannot count with certainty on being able to earn even the\r\nnecessaries of life; if this or Communism, were the alternative, all the\r\ndifficulties, great or small, of Communism would be but as dust in the\r\nbalance.\"--John Stuart Mill, \"Principles of Political Economy.\" Mill\r\nstrove diligently to \"reform\" the bourgeois world, and to \"bring it to\r\nreason.\" Of course, in vain. And so it came about that he, like all\r\nclear-sighted men, became a Socialist. He dared not, however, admit the\r\nfact in his life time, but ordered that, after his death, his\r\nauto-biography be published, containing his Socialist confession of\r\nfaith. It happened to him as with Darwin, who cared not to be known in\r\nhis life as an atheist. The bourgeoisie affects loyalty, religion and\r\nfaith in authority because through the acceptance of these \"virtues\" by\r\nthe masses its own rule is safeguarded; in its own sleeves, however, it\r\nlaughs at them.\r\n\r\n[192] \"Scholarship is as often the hand-maid of ignorance as of\r\nprogress.\"--Buckle's \"History of Civilization in England.\"\r\n\r\n[193] According to the census of 1882 there were in Germany engaged in\r\ntrade and transportation 1,570,318 persons, inclusive of those occupied\r\nin hotels and inns, and exclusive of 295,451 domestics.\r\n\r\n[Some opinion may be formed of the volume of useless labor, parasitism,\r\nin the United States, from the census figures for 1900.

The Syllabus and the encyclicals of the\r\nnineteenth century have lost all recollection of this tone, and even the\r\nRoman Popes have been compelled to become subjects of capitalist\r\nsociety, and now pose as its zealous defenders against the Socialists.\r\n\r\nIn contrast therewith Bishop Clemens I. (deceased 102 of our reckoning)\r\nsaid: \"The use of all things in this world is to be common to all. It is\r\nan injustice to say: 'This is my property, this belongs to me, that\r\nbelongs to another.' Hence the origin of contentions among men.\"\r\n\r\nBishop Ambrose of Milan, who lived about 347, exclaimed: \"Nature bestows\r\nall things on all men in common, for God has created all things that\r\ntheir enjoyment might be common to all, and that the earth might become\r\nthe common possession of all. Common possession is, therefore, a right\r\nestablished by Nature, and only unjust usurpation (usurpatio) has\r\ncreated the right of private property.\"\r\n\r\nSt. John Chrysostomus (deceased 407) declared in his homilies directed\r\nagainst the immorality and corruption of the population of\r\nConstantinople: \"Let none call aught his own; we have received\r\neverything from God for enjoyment in common, and 'mine' and 'thine' are\r\nwords of falsehood.\"\r\n\r\nSt. Augustine (deceased 430) expressed himself thus: \"Because private\r\nproperty exists there exists also law suits, enmities, dissensions,\r\nwars, rebellions, sins, injustice, murder. Whence proceed all these\r\nscourges? From property only. Let us then, my brothers, refrain from\r\npossessing anything as our property; at least let us refrain from loving\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nPope Gregory the Great declares about 600: \"Let them know that the earth\r\nfrom which they spring and of which they are formed belongs to all men\r\nin common, and that therefore the fruits which the earth brings forth\r\nmust belong to all without distinction.\"\r\n\r\nAnd one of the moderns, Zacharia, says in his \"Forty Books on the\r\nState\": \"All the evils with which civilized nations have to contend, can\r\nbe traced back to private property in land.\"\r\n\r\nAll these authorities have recognized more or less accurately the nature\r\nof private property, which, since its existence, as St. Augustine\r\ncorrectly puts it, brought law suits, enmities, dissensions, wars,\r\nrebellions, injustice and murder into the world,--all of them evils that\r\nwill disappear with its abolition.\r\n\r\n[195] \"The employment of water in the cultivation of fruit as well as of\r\nvegetables is highly desirable; water associations with these ends in\r\nview could turn with us also deserts into paradises.\" Official report on\r\nthe Chicago Exposition of 1893, rendered by the Imperial Commissioner,\r\nBerlin, 1894.\r\n\r\n[196] This prospect seems nearer realization and in a quite different\r\nmanner than the most far-sighted could have imagined.

It is this: Let every farmer, like\r\nthe Chinese coolie, who carries a sack of corn or a hundred weight of\r\nrape, or carrots or potatoes, etc., to town, bring back with him as much\r\nif possible or more of the ingredients of his field products as he took\r\nwith him, and restore it to the field whence it came. He must not\r\ndespise a potato paring or a straw, but remember that one of his\r\npotatoes still needs a skin, and one of his ears of corn a stalk. The\r\nexpense for this importation is slight, the outlay secure; a savings\r\nbank is not securer, and no investment brings in a higher rate of\r\ninterest. The returns of his fields will be doubled in ten years: he\r\nwill produce more corn, more meat and more cheese without expending more\r\ntime or labor, and he will not be driven by constant anxiety to seek for\r\nnew and unknown means, which do not exist, to make his ground fertile in\r\nanother manner.... Old bones, soot, ashes, whether washed out or not,\r\nand blood of animals and refuse of all kinds ought to be collected in\r\nstorehouses, and prepared for distribution....

In 1871 it had only 8 of them. In 1871,\r\nBerlin had, in round figures, 826,000 inhabitants; in 1890 it had\r\n1,578,794--it had almost doubled. A number of these large cities were\r\ncompelled to take within their municipalities the contiguous industrial\r\ntowns, that in themselves had populations large enough for cities.\r\nThrough the process, the population of the former rose immediately.\r\nThus, within the period of 1885 to 1890, Leipsic rose from 170,000 to\r\n353,000; Cologne from 161,000 to 282,000; Madgeburg from 114,000 to\r\n201,000; Munich from 270,000 to 345,000 inhabitants, etc. At the same\r\ntime, most of the other cities that incorporated no contiguous towns\r\nincreased considerably during that period. Breslau grew from 299,000 to\r\n335,000; Dresden from 246,000 to 276,000; Frankfurt-on-Main from 154,000\r\nto 180,000; Hanover from 140,000 to 163,000; Dusseldorf from 115,000 to\r\n146,000; Nuerenberg from 115,000 to 142,000; Chemnitz from 111,000 to\r\n139,000 inhabitants. Similar growths were also registered by many\r\nmiddle-sized cities of 50,000 to 100,000 inhabitants.\r\n\r\n[In the United States, the concentration of population in large cities\r\nhas been marked. In 1790 only 3.4 per cent. of the total population\r\nlived in cities. The proportion of urban to the total population then\r\ngrew from census year to census year (decade to decade) as follows: 4.0\r\nin 1800; 4.9 in 1810; 4.9 in 1820; 6.7 in 1830; 8.5 in 1840; 12.5 in\r\n1850; 16.1 in 1860; 20.9 in 1870; 22.6 in 1880; 29.2 in 1890; and 33.1\r\nin 1900. According to the census of 1900 there live 14,208,347 of the\r\npopulation in cities of at least 100,000 inhabitants; 5,549,271 in\r\ncities of 25,000 to 100,000 inhabitants; 5,286,375 in cities of 8,000 to\r\n25,000 inhabitants; 3,380,193 in cities of 4,000 to 8,000 inhabitants;\r\nand 2,214,136 in cities of 2,500 to 4,000 inhabitants.

Under existing circumstances,\r\nthe small farmer is downright inaccessible to higher culture: he toils\r\nat hard labor from early dawn till late, and lives often worse than a\r\ndog. Meat, butter, eggs, milk, which he produces, he does not enjoy: he\r\nproduces them for others: under present circumstances he can not raise\r\nhimself into better conditions: he thus becomes an element that clogs\r\ncivilization. He who loves retrogression, seeing he finds his account\r\ntherein, may also find satisfaction in the continuance of such a social\r\nstratum. Human progress demands its disappearance.\r\n\r\n[206] At the Erfurt \"Union Parliament\" of 1850, Prince Bismarck\r\nthundered against the large cities as \"the hot-beds of revolution,\" that\r\nshould be razed to the ground.

For all their etymology is identical, custom and social\r\ninstitutions have imparted to the German term a meaning, or a shade of a\r\nmeaning, that it lacks in English. \"Die Religion\" is in Germany a State\r\ninstitution; it is part of the curriculum of colleges; and it is there\r\nso utterly creedy, churchianic, and dogmatic that it is a positive\r\nabomination even to the students who mean to devote themselves to\r\ntheology. That, however, even in the German language the word has a\r\nvarying meaning may be gathered from the epigram of Schiller: \"To what\r\nreligion I belong? To none. Why? Out of religiousness\"--literally in\r\nGerman, \"out of religion.\" The reproduction in this translation of the\r\nidea conveyed by the term \"Die Religion\" presented its difficulties.

Let a prince, therefore, do what he\r\ncan to preserve his life, and continue his supremacy, the means which he\r\nuses shall be thought honorable, and be commended by everybody; because\r\nthe people are always taken with the appearance and event of things,\r\nand, the greatest part of the world consists of the people; those few\r\nwho are wise taking place when the multitude has nothing else to rely\r\nupon.\"--Macchiavelli in his celebrated work, \"The Prince.\" Macchiavelli\r\nwas born in Florence, 1469.\r\n\r\n[211] Whenever the modern bourgeois is at a loss for reasons to justify\r\nsome enormity with, a thousand to one he falls back upon \"morality.\" In\r\nthe spring of 1894, it went so far that, at a meeting of the Evangelical\r\nSynod, a \"liberal\" member of the Berlin Chamber of the Exchequer\r\npronounced it \"moral\" that only taxpayers should have the right to vote\r\nat Church meetings (!)\r\n\r\n[212] \"A certain degree of well-being and culture is a necessary\r\nexternal condition for the development of the philosophic spirit....\r\nThence we find that people began to philosophize only in those nations,\r\nthat had raised themselves to a considerable height of well-being and\r\nculture.\"--Tennemann, quoted by Buckle in a foot note, _ubi supra_.\r\n\r\n\"Material and intellectual interests go hand in hand.

A new\r\nState or social order radically different from the preceding one can not\r\npossibly be produced at will; to imagine such a thing would be to ignore\r\nand deny all the laws of development, obedient to which State and\r\nSociety have hitherto risen and developed. Eugen Richter and those who\r\nshare his views may take comfort: if Socialism really implies the silly\r\nand unnatural aims imputed to it by them, it will go to pieces, and\r\nwithout the aid of the \"Irrelehren\" of Richter. But it happens that\r\nthere is no political party that stands as squarely and logically upon\r\nthe evolutionary field as the Social Democratic.\r\n\r\nQuite as unfounded as all the other objections are the remarks of Eugene\r\nRichter: \"For a social condition, such as the Socialists want, the\r\npeople must be angels.\" As is well known, there are no angels, nor do we\r\nneed any. Partly are men influenced by conditions, and partly are\r\nconditions influenced by men, and the latter will be increasingly the\r\ncase in the measure that men learn to know the nature of the social\r\nsystem that they themselves rear, and in the measure that the experience\r\nthus gathered is consciously applied by them by corresponding changes in\r\ntheir social organization,--and that is Socialism. What we need is not\r\nother people, but wiser and more intelligent people than most of them\r\nare to-day. It is with the end in view of making people wiser and more\r\nintelligent that we agitate, Herr Richter, and that we publish works\r\nlike this one.\r\n\r\n[214] It is surprising that, considering the fathomless blockishness of\r\nour adversaries, none has yet claimed that in Socialist society everyone\r\nwould receive an equal portion of food and an equal quantity of linen\r\nand clothing so as to \"crown the work of uniformity.\" Such a claim is\r\nquite stupid enough to expect its being made by our opponents.\r\n\r\n[215] Fourier made this the subject of a brilliant argument, although he\r\nran into utopianism in the elaboration of his ideas.\r\n\r\n[216] Condorcet demands in his plan of education: \"Education must be\r\nfree, equal, general, bodily, mental, industrial and political, and it\r\nmust aim at real and actual equality.\"\r\n\r\nLikewise Rousseau in his \"Political Economy\": \"Above all, education must\r\nbe public, equal and mixed, for the purpose of raising men and\r\ncitizens.\"\r\n\r\nAristotle also demands: \"Seeing the State has but one object, it must\r\nalso provide one and the same education for all its members. The care\r\nhereof must be the concern of the State and not a private affair.\"\r\n\r\n[217] Eugene Richter among them, in his \"Irrelehren.\"\r\n\r\n[218] \"America's Bildungswesen,\" by Prof. Emil Hausknecht.\r\n\r\n[219] \"The person who has led an honorable and active life until old age\r\nshould not then have to live either on the charity of his children or of\r\nbourgeois society. An independent old age, free from cares or toil, is\r\nthe natural reward for continuous exertions in the days of strength and\r\nhealth.\"--v. Thuenen's \"Der Isolirte Staat.\" But how is it to-day in\r\nthis bourgeois society? Millions look with dread towards the time when,\r\nhaving grown old, they are thrown upon the street. And our industrial\r\nsystem causes people to age prematurely. The very much boasted about\r\nold-age and invalid pensions in the German Empire afford but a very\r\nscanty substitute: even its most zealous defenders admit that. Their\r\naids are still more inadequate than the pensions which the\r\nmunicipalities allow to the large majority of the officials whom they\r\nprovide with pensions.\r\n\r\n[220] [It is a feature of theology to be positive, precise and emphatic\r\nin descriptions of what the describer knows nothing about.

Nevertheless, while\r\nrespecting the author's private opinion in the matter, and leaving his\r\nsentence untouched, the following phrasing would seem preferable, as\r\nfree from the taint of what may be called the \"theologic method,\" and\r\nalso more in keeping with the mental posture of positive knowledge:\r\n\"Whether to be dead means to be ended or not, is a matter on which man\r\nawaits the fiat of Science.\"--THE TRANSLATOR.]\r\n\r\n[221] [It is otherwise in the United States, where, as a rule, clergymen\r\nhave to \"hustle\"--both to curry favor with their parishioners and to\r\ncountermine the mines laid by their competitors for fatter \"calls,\" or\r\nby their numerous unemployed \"brothers of the cloth.\" According to the\r\ncensus of 1900, clergymen had the very highest death rate (23.5) among\r\nthe professional occupations for the registration area,--and it was\r\namong the highest altogether. It was excelled only by the death rate of\r\nthe coopers (23.8); of the millers, flour and grist, (26.6); of the\r\nsailors, pilots, fishermen and oystermen (27.7); and of the stock\r\nraisers, herders and drovers (32.1).

As far as we know, Herr Richter\r\nis a bachelor. Obviously he does not miss his own kitchen: to judge from\r\nthe rotundity of his body, he does not fare ill. If Herr Richter were a\r\nmarried man and possessed a wife, who had herself to administer the\r\nkitchen department and to perform in it the needed work, instead of\r\nleaving all that to servants, as is the fashion with the women of the\r\nproperty classes, then, a hundred to one his wife would nicely prove to\r\nhim how happy she would be if she only could be freed from the bondage\r\nof the kitchen through the large and thoroughly equipped communal\r\ninstitute for meals.\r\n\r\n[223] Niemeyer, \"Gesundheitslehre.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nWOMAN IN THE FUTURE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOMAN IN THE FUTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis chapter can be condensed in few words. It only contains the\r\nconclusions that flow from what has been said, conclusions that the\r\nreader may draw for himself.\r\n\r\nThe woman of future society is socially and economically independent;\r\nshe is no longer subject to even a vestige of dominion and exploitation;\r\nshe is free, the peer of man, mistress of her lot. Her education is the\r\nsame as that of man, with such exceptions as the difference of sex and\r\nsexual functions demand. Living under natural conditions, she is able to\r\nunfold and exercise her mental powers and faculties. She chooses her\r\noccupation on such field as corresponds with her wishes, inclinations\r\nand natural abilities, and she works under conditions identical with\r\nman's. Even if engaged as a practical working-woman on some field or\r\nother, at other times of the day she may be educator, teacher or nurse,\r\nat yet others she may exercise herself in art, or cultivate some branch\r\nof science, and at yet others may be filling some administrative\r\nfunction. She joins in studies, enjoyments or social intercourse with\r\neither her sisters or with men,--as she may please or occasion may\r\nserve.\r\n\r\nIn the choice of love, she is, like man, free and unhampered. She woos\r\nor is wooed, and closes the bond from no considerations other than her\r\nown inclinations. This bond is a private contract, celebrated without\r\nthe intervention of any functionary--just as marriage was a private\r\ncontract until deep in the Middle Ages. Socialism creates in this\r\nnothing new: it merely restores, at a higher level of civilization and\r\nunder new social forms, that which prevailed at a more primitive social\r\nstage, and before private property began to rule society.\r\n\r\nUnder the proviso that he inflict injury upon none, the individual shall\r\nhimself oversee the satisfaction of his own instincts. _The satisfaction\r\nof the sexual instinct is as much a private concern as the satisfaction\r\nof any other natural instinct._ None is therefor accountable to others,\r\nand no unsolicited judge may interfere. How I shall eat, how I shall\r\ndrink, how I shall sleep, how I shall clothe myself, is my private\r\naffair,--exactly so my intercourse with a person of the opposite sex.\r\nIntelligence and culture, perfect individual freedom--qualities that\r\nbecome normal through the education and the conditions of future\r\nsociety--will guard everyone against the commission of acts that will\r\nredound to his injury. Self-training and the knowledge of their own\r\nbeing are possessions of the men and the women of future society to a\r\ndegree much above the present. The simple circumstance that all bashful\r\nprudery and affectation of secrecy regarding natural matters will have\r\nvanished is a guarantee of a more natural intercourse of the sexes than\r\nthat which prevails to-day. If incompatibility, disenchantment, or\r\nrepulsion set in between two persons that have come together, morality\r\ncommands that the unnatural, and therefore immoral, bond be dissolved.\r\nSeeing, moreover, that all the circumstances and conditions, which until\r\nthen condemned large numbers of women to celibacy and to prostitution,\r\nwill have vanished, man can no longer superimpose himself. On the other\r\nhand, the completely changed social conditions will have removed the\r\nnumerous inconveniences that to-day affect married life, that often\r\nprevent its favorable unfolding, or that even render it wholly\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nThe contradictions in and the unnatural features of the present position\r\nof woman are realized with ever increasing force in wide social circles.\r\nThe sentiment finds lively utterance in the literature of the Social\r\nQuestion as well as in works of fiction,--often, it must be confessed,\r\nin wrongful manner. That the present form of marriage corresponds ever\r\nless with its purpose, no thinking person any longer denies. Thus is\r\nseen the phenomenon of the demand for freedom in the choice of love, and\r\nfor the untrammeled dissolution of the marriage bond, when necessary,\r\nmade by people who refuse to draw the requisite conclusions for the\r\nchange of the present social system. They believe that the freedom of\r\nsexual intercourse must be asserted only in behalf of the privileged\r\nclasses. In a polemic against Fanny Lewald's efforts in behalf of the\r\nemancipation of woman, Mathilde Reichhardt-Stromberg expresses herself\r\nthis wise:\r\n\r\n\"If you (Fanny Lewald) claim the complete equality of woman with man in\r\nsocial and political life, George Sand also must be right in her\r\nstruggles for emancipation, which aim no further than at what man has\r\nlong been in undisputed possession of. Indeed, there is no reasonable\r\nground for admitting the head and not the heart of woman to this\r\nequality, to give and to take as freely as man. On the contrary, if\r\nwoman has by nature the right, and, consequently, also the duty--for we\r\nshould not bury the talent bestowed upon us--of exerting her brain\r\ntissue to the utmost in the race with the intellectual Titans of the\r\nopposite sex, she must then have precisely the same right to preserve\r\nher equilibrium by quickening the circulation of her heart's blood in\r\nwhatever way it may seem good to her. Do we not all read without the\r\nslightest moral indignation how Goethe--to begin with the greatest as an\r\nillustration--again and again wasted the warmth of his heart and the\r\nenthusiasm of his great soul on a different woman? Reasonable people\r\nregard this as perfectly natural by the very reason of the greatness of\r\nhis soul, and the difficulty of satisfying it. Only the narrow-minded\r\nmoralist stops to condemn his conduct. Why, then, deride the 'great\r\nsouls' among women!... Let us suppose that the whole female sex\r\nconsisted of great souls like George Sand, that every woman were a\r\nLucretia Floriani, whose children are all children of love and who\r\nbrought up all these children with true motherly love and devotion, as\r\nwell as with intelligence and good sense. What would become of the\r\nworld? There can be no doubt that it could continue to exist and to\r\nprogress, just as it does now; it might even feel exceptionally\r\ncomfortable under the arrangement.\"[224]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Mathilde Reichhardt-Stromberg is of the opinion that, if\r\nevery woman were a Lucretia Floriani, that is, a great soul like George\r\nSand, who draws her own picture in Lucretia Floriani, they should be\r\nfree for the \"preservation of their equilibrium to quicken the\r\ncirculation of their heart's blood in whatever way it may seem good to\r\nthem.\" But why should that be the privilege of the \"great souls\" only,\r\nand not of the others also, who are no \"great souls,\" and can be none?\r\nNo such difference exists to us. If a Goethe and a George Sand--to take\r\nthese two from the many who have acted and are acting like them--live\r\naccording to the inclinations of their hearts--and about Goethe's love\r\naffairs whole libraries are published that are devoured by his male and\r\nfemale admirers in wrapt ecstasy--why condemn in others that, which done\r\nby a Goethe or a George Sand, becomes the subject of ecstatic\r\nadmiration?\r\n\r\nIndeed, such freedom in the choice of love is an impossibility in\r\nbourgeois society. This fact was the objective point in our preceding\r\narray of evidence. But place the whole community under social conditions\r\nsimilar to those enjoyed by the material and intellectual elect, and\r\nforthwith the opportunity is there of equal rights and freedom for all.\r\nIn \"Jacques,\" George Sand depicts a husband who judges the adulterous\r\nrelations of his wife with another man in these words: \"No human being\r\ncan command love; and none is guilty if he feels, or goes without it.\r\nWhat degrades the woman is the lie: what constitutes her adultery is not\r\nthe hour that she grants to her lover, but the night that she thereupon\r\nspends with her husband.\" Thanks to this view of the matter, Jacques\r\nfeels obliged to yield the place to his rival, Borel, and he proceeds to\r\nphilosophize: \"Borel, in my place, would have quietly beaten his wife,\r\nand perhaps would not have blushed to receive her afterwards into his\r\nbed, debased by his blows and his kisses. There are men who cut the\r\nthroat of an unfaithful wife without ceremony, after the fashion of the\r\nOrientals, because they consider her as legal property. Others fight\r\nwith their rival, kill him or drive him away, and again seek the kisses\r\nof the woman they pretend to love, and who shrinks from them with\r\nhorror, or resigns herself in despair. These, in cases of conjugal love,\r\nare the most common ways of acting, and I say that the love of the hogs\r\nis less vile and less gross than that of these men.\" Commenting on these\r\npassages, Brandes observes: \"These truths, which are considered\r\nelemental with our cultured classes, were 'sophisms that cried to\r\nheaven' only fifty years ago.\" But the \"property and cultured world\"\r\ndare not to this day openly avow the principles of George Sand,\r\nalthough, in point of fact, it lives up to them in the main. As in\r\nmorality and religion, the bourgeois is a hypocrite in marriage also.\r\n\r\nWhat Goethe and George Sand did, has been done and continues to be done\r\nby thousands of others, who are not to be compared with Goethe, yet\r\nwithout in the least losing the esteem and respect of society. All that\r\nis needed is a respectable position, the rest comes of itself. All this\r\nnotwithstanding, the liberties of a Goethe and a George Sand are\r\nimproper, judged from the standpoint of bourgeois morality, and stand in\r\ncontradiction with the nature of its social principles. Compulsory\r\nmarriage is the normal marriage of bourgeois society: it is the only\r\n\"moral\" union of the sexes: all other sexual union, by whomsoever\r\nentered into, is immoral. Bourgeois marriage--we have proved the point\r\nbeyond cavil--is the result of bourgeois property relations. This\r\nmarriage, which is intimately related with private property and the\r\nright of inheritance--demands \"legitimate\" children as heirs: it is\r\nentered into for the purpose of acquiring these: under the pressure of\r\nsocial conditions, it is forced even upon those who have nothing to\r\nbequeath:[225] it becomes a social law, the violation of which the State\r\npunishes by imprisoning for a term of years the men or women who live in\r\nadultery and have been divorced.\r\n\r\nIn future society there is nothing to bequeath, unless the domestic\r\nequipment and personal inventory be regarded as inheritance: the modern\r\nform of marriage is thus devoid of foundation and collapses. The\r\nquestion of inheritance is thereby solved, and Socialism need not\r\nconcern itself about abolishing the same. No right of inheritance can\r\narise where there is no private property.\r\n\r\nWoman is, accordingly, free, and her children, where she has any, do not\r\nimpair her freedom: they can only fill all the fuller the cup of her\r\nenjoyments and her pleasure in life. Nurses, teachers, female friends,\r\nthe rising female generations--all these are ready at hand to help the\r\nmother when she needs help.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that there may be men in the future who will say with\r\nAlexander von Humboldt: \"I am not built for the father of a family.\r\nMoreover, I consider marriage a sin, and the begetting of children a\r\ncrime.\" What of it? The power of natural instincts will restore the\r\nequilibrium. We are alarmed neither by a Humboldt's hostility to\r\nmarriage nor by the philosophic pessimism of a Schopenhauer, a\r\nMainlaender or a v. Hartmann, who raise to man the prospect of\r\nself-destruction in the \"ideal State,\" In this matter we hold with Fr.\r\nRatzel, who justly says:\r\n\r\n\"Man may no longer look upon himself as an exception to the laws of\r\nNature; he should rather begin at last to ascertain the law that\r\nunderlies his own acts and thoughts, and to endeavor to live his life\r\naccording to the laws of Nature. He will arrive at the point when he\r\nwill arrange his social life with his fellows, that is, his family and\r\nthe State, not after the precepts of far-back centuries, but after the\r\nrational principles of natural sense. Politics, morals, principles of\r\njustice--all of which are at present fed from all possible sources--will\r\nbe determined according to the laws of Nature alone. An existence worthy\r\nof human beings, dreamed of for thousands of years, will finally become\r\nreality.\"[226]\r\n\r\nThat day is approaching with giant strides. Human society has traversed,\r\nin the course of thousands of years, all the various phases of\r\ndevelopment, to arrive in the end where it started from,--communistic\r\nproperty and complete equality and fraternity, but no longer among\r\ncongeners alone, but among the whole human race. In that does the great\r\nprogress consist. What bourgeois society has vainly striven for, and at\r\nwhich it suffers and is bound to suffer shipwreck--the restoration of\r\nfreedom, equality and fraternity among men--Socialism will accomplish.\r\nBourgeois society could only set up the theory; here, as in so many\r\nother respects, their practice was at odds with their theories. It is\r\nfor Socialism to harmonize the theory with the practice.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, while man returns to the starting point in his\r\ndevelopment, the return is effected upon an infinitely higher social\r\nplane than that from which he started. Primitive society held property\r\nin common in the gens and clan, but only in the rawest and most\r\nundeveloped stage. The process of development that took place since,\r\nreduced, it is true, the common property to a small and insignificant\r\nvestige, broke up the gentes, and finally atomized the whole of society;\r\nbut, simultaneously, it raised mightily the productivity of that society\r\nin its various phases and the manifoldness of social necessities, and it\r\ncreated out of the gentes and tribes nations and great States, although\r\nagain it produced a condition of things that stood in violent\r\ncontradiction with social requirements. The task of the future is to end\r\nthe contradiction by the re-transformation upon the broadest basis, of\r\nproperty and productive powers into collective property.\r\n\r\nSociety re-takes what once was its own, but, in accord with the newly\r\ncreated conditions of production, it places its whole mode of life upon\r\nthe highest stage of culture, which enables all to enjoy what under more\r\nprimitive circumstances was the privilege of individuals or of\r\nindividual classes only.\r\n\r\nNow woman again fills the active _role_ that once was hers in primitive\r\nsociety. She does not become the mistress, she is the equal of man.\r\n\r\n\"The end of social development resembles the beginning of human\r\nexistence. The original equality returns. The mother-web of existence\r\nstarts and rounds up the cycle of human affairs\"--thus writes Bachofen,\r\nin his frequently quoted work \"Das Mutterrecht,\" forecasting coming\r\nevents. Like Bachofen, Morgan also passes judgment upon bourgeois\r\nsociety, a judgment that, without his having any particular information\r\non Socialism, coincides essentially with our own. He says:\r\n\r\n\"Since the advent of civilization, the outgrowth of property has been so\r\nimmense, its forms so diversified, its uses so expanding and its\r\n_management so intelligent in the interests of its owners, that it has\r\nbecome, on the part of the people, an unmanageable power_. The human\r\nmind stands bewildered in the presence of its own creation. The time\r\nwill come, nevertheless, when human intelligence will rise to the\r\nmastery over property, and define the relations of the State to the\r\nproperty it protects, as well as the obligations and the limits of the\r\nrights of its owners. _The interests of society are paramount to\r\nindividual interests, and the two must be brought into just and\r\nharmonious relations._ A mere property career is not the final destiny\r\nof mankind, if progress is to be the law of the future as it has been of\r\nthe past. The time which has passed away since civilization began is but\r\na fragment of the past duration of man's existence; and but a fragment\r\nof the ages yet to come. _The dissolution of society bids fair to become\r\nthe termination of a career of which property is the end and aim;\r\nbecause such a career contains the elements of self-destruction.\r\nDemocracy in government, brotherhood in society, equality in rights and\r\nprivileges, and universal education, foreshadow the next higher plane of\r\nsociety to which experience, intelligence and knowledge are steadily\r\ntending. It will be a revival, in a higher form, of the liberty,\r\nequality and fraternity of the ancient gentes._\"[227]\r\n\r\nThus we see how men, proceeding from different starting-points, are\r\nguided by their scientific investigations to the identical conclusions.\r\nThe complete emancipation of woman, and her equality with man is the\r\nfinal goal of our social development, whose realization no power on\r\nearth can prevent;--and this realization is possible only by a social\r\nchange that shall abolish the rule of man over man--hence also of\r\ncapitalists over workingmen. Only then will the human race reach its\r\nhighest development. The \"Golden Age\" that man has been dreaming of for\r\nthousands of years, and after which he has been longing, will have come\r\nat last. Class rule will have reached its end for all time, and, along\r\nwith it, the rule of man over woman.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[224] \"Frauenrecht und Frauenpflilcht. Eine Antwort auf Fanny Lewald's\r\nBriefe 'Fuer und wider die Frauen.'\"\r\n\r\n[225] In his work \"Bau und Leben des sozialen Koerpers\" (The Structure\r\nand Life of the Social Body), Dr. Schaeffle says: \"A loosening of the\r\nbonds of matrimony by the facilitation of divorce is certainly\r\nundesirable. It flies in the face of the moral objects of human pairing,\r\nand would be injurious to the preservation of the population as well as\r\nthe education of the children.\" After what has been said herein it\r\nfollows that we not only consider this view wrong, but are inclined to\r\nregard it as \"immoral.\" Nevertheless, Dr. Schaeffle will allow that the\r\nidea of introducing and maintaining institutions that do violence to its\r\nown conceptions of morality, is simply unimaginable in a society of much\r\nhigher culture than the present.\r\n\r\n[226] Quoted in Haeckel's \"Natuerliche Schoepfungsgeschichte.\"\r\n\r\n[227] Morgan's \"Ancient Society.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONALITY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONALITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the very nature of things, an existence worthy of human beings can\r\nnever be the exclusive possession of a single privileged people.\r\nIsolated from all others, no nation could either raise or keep up such\r\nan establishment. The development that we have reached is the product of\r\nthe co-operation of national and international forces and relations.\r\nAlthough with many the national idea still wholly sways the mind, and\r\nsubserves the purpose of maintaining political and social dominations,\r\npossible only within national boundaries, the human race has reached far\r\ninto internationalism.\r\n\r\nTreaties of commerce, of tariffs and of shipping, postal unions,\r\ninternational expositions, conventions on international law and on\r\ninternational systems of measurement, international scientific\r\ncongresses and associations, international expeditions of discovery, our\r\ntrade and intercommunication, especially the international congresses of\r\nworkingmen, who are the carriers of the new social order and to whose\r\nmoral influence was mainly due the international congress for factory\r\nlegislation in the interest of the workingmen, assembled in Berlin in\r\nthe spring of 1890 upon the invitation of the German Empire,--these and\r\nmany other phenomena testify to the international character that,\r\ndespite national demarcations, the relations between the various\r\ncivilized nations have assumed. National boundary lines are being broken\r\nthrough. The term \"world's economy\" is taking the place of \"national\r\neconomy\": an increasing significance is attaching to it, seeing that\r\nupon it depends the well-being and prosperity of individual nations. A\r\nlarge part of our own products is exchanged for those of foreign\r\nnations, without which we could no longer exist. As one branch of\r\nindustry is injured when another suffers, so likewise does the\r\nproduction of one nation suffer materially when that of another is\r\nparalyzed. Despite all such transitory disturbances as wars and race\r\npersecutions, the relations of the several nations draw ever closer,\r\nbecause material interests, the strongest of all, dominate them. Each\r\nnew highway, every improvement in the means of intercommunication, every\r\ninvention or improvement in the process of production, whereby goods are\r\nmade cheaper, strengthens these relations. The ease with which personal\r\ncontact can be established between distantly located countries and\r\npeoples is a new and powerful link in the chain that draws and holds the\r\nnations together. Emigrations and colonizations are additional and\r\npowerful levers. One people learns from the other. Each seeks to excel.\r\nAlong with the interchange of material products, the interchange of the\r\nproducts of the mind is going on, in the original tongue as well as in\r\ntranslations. To millions the learning of foreign living languages\r\nbecomes a necessity. Next to material advantages, nothing contributes\r\nmore towards removing antipathies than to penetrate into the language\r\nand the intellectual products of a foreign people.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this process of drawing together, that is going on upon an\r\ninternational scale, is that the several nations are resembling one\r\nanother ever more in their social conditions. With the most advanced,\r\nand therefore pace-setting nations, the resemblance is now such that he\r\nwho has learned to understand the social structure of one, likewise\r\nknows that of all the others in essentials. It happens similarly as in\r\nNature where, among animals of the same species the skeleton formation\r\nand organization is the same, and, if in possession of a part of such a\r\nskeleton, one can theoretically construct the whole animal.\r\n\r\nA further result is this, that where the same social foundations are\r\nfound, their effects must be the same--the accumulation of vast wealth,\r\nand its opposite pole of mass-poverty, wage-slavery, dependence of the\r\nmasses upon the machinery of production, their domination by the\r\nproperty-holding minority, and the rest of the long train of\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nIndeed, we see that the class antagonisms and the class struggles, that\r\nrage throughout Germany, equally keep all Europe, the United States,\r\nAustralia, etc., in commotion. In Europe, from Russia across to\r\nPortugal, from the Balkans, Hungary and Italy across to England and\r\nIreland, the same spirit of discontent is prevalent, the identical\r\nsymptoms of social fermentation, of general apprehension and of\r\ndecomposition are noticeable. Externally unlike, according to the degree\r\nof development, the character of the people and their political\r\norganization, these movements are all essentially alike. Deep-reaching\r\nsocial antagonisms are their cause. Every year these antagonisms become\r\nmore pronounced, the fermentation and discontent sinks deeper and\r\nspreads wider, until finally some provocation, possibly insignificant in\r\nseeming, brings on the explosion, that then spreads like lightning\r\nthroughout the civilized world, and calls upon the people to take\r\nsides--pro or con.\r\n\r\nThe battle is then on between New and Old Society. Masses of people step\r\nupon the stage; an abundance of intelligence is enlisted, such as the\r\nworld never before saw engaged in any contest, and never again will see\r\ngathered for such a purpose. _It is the last social struggle of all._\r\nStanding at the elevation of this century, the sight is obvious of the\r\nsteady coming to a head of the forces for the struggle in which the New\r\nIdeas will triumph.\r\n\r\nThe new social system will then rear itself upon an international basis.\r\nThe peoples will fraternize; they will reach one another the hand, and\r\nthey will endeavor to gradually extend the new conditions over all the\r\nraces of the earth.[228] No people any longer approaches another as an\r\nenemy, bent upon oppression and exploitation; or as the representative\r\nof a strange creed that it seeks to impose upon others;--they will meet\r\none another as friends, who seek to raise all human beings to the height\r\nof civilization. The labors of the new social order in its work of\r\ncolonization and civilization will differ as essentially in both purpose\r\nand method from the present, as the two social orders are essentially\r\ndifferent from each other. Neither powder nor lead, neither \"firewater\"\r\n(liquor) nor Bible will be used. The task of civilization is entered\r\nupon with the instruments of peace, which will present the civilizers to\r\nthe savages, not as enemies, but as benefactors. Intelligent travelers\r\nand investigators have long learned to know how successful is that path.\r\n\r\nWhen the civilized peoples shall have reached the point of joining in a\r\nlarge federation, the time will have come when for evermore the storms\r\nof war shall have been lain. Perpetual peace is no dream, as the\r\ngentlemen who strut about in uniforms seek to make people believe. That\r\nday shall have come the moment the peoples shall have understood their\r\ntrue interests: these are not promoted by war and dissension, by\r\narmaments that bear down whole nations; they are promoted by peaceful,\r\nmutual understandings, and jointly laboring in the path of civilization.\r\nMoreover, as was shown on page 238, the ruling classes and their\r\nGovernments are seeing to it that the military armaments and wars break\r\ntheir own backs by their own immensity. Thus the last weapons will\r\nwander into the museums of antiquity, as so many of their predecessors\r\nhave done before, and serve as witnesses to future generations of the\r\nmanner in which the generations gone by have for thousands of years\r\nfrequently torn up one another like wild animals--until finally the\r\nhuman in them triumphed over the beast.\r\n\r\nNational peculiarities are everywhere nourished by the ruling classes in\r\norder that, at a given conjuncture, a great war may furnish a drainage\r\nfor dangerous tendencies at home. As a proof of the extent to which\r\nthese national peculiarities engender wars, an utterance of the late\r\nGeneral Fieldmarshal Moltke may here be quoted. In the last volume of\r\nhis posthumous work, which deals with the German-French war of 1870-71,\r\nthis passage occurs among others in the introductory observations:\r\n\r\n\"So long as nations lead separate existences there will be dissensions\r\nthat only strokes can arbitrate. In the interest of humanity, however,\r\nit is to be hoped that wars may become as much rarer as they have become\r\nmore fearful.\"\r\n\r\nNow then, this national separate existence, that is, the hostile\r\nshutting off of one nation from another, will vanish. Thus future\r\ngenerations will be able to achieve without trouble tasks that gifted\r\nheads have long conceived, and unsuccessfully attempted to accomplish.\r\nCondorcet, among others, conceived the idea of an international\r\nlanguage. The late Ulysses S. Grant, ex-President of the United States,\r\nuttered himself this wise on a public occasion: \"Seeing that commerce,\r\neducation and the rapid exchange of thought and of goods by telegraphy\r\nand steam have altered everything, I believe that God is preparing the\r\nworld to become one nation, to speak one language and to reach a state\r\nof perfection in which armies and navies will no longer be needed.\" It\r\nis natural that with a full-blooded Yankee the leading _role_ be played\r\nby the \"dear God,\" who, after all, is but the product of historic\r\ndevelopment. Hypocrisy, or perhaps also ignorance in matters that\r\nconcern religion, is nowhere as stupendous as in the United States. The\r\nless the power of the State presses upon the masses, all the more must\r\nreligion do the work. Hence the phenomenon that the bourgeoisie is most\r\npious wherever the power of the State is laxest. Next to the United\r\nStates, come England, Belgium and Switzerland in this matter. Even the\r\nrevolutionary Robespierre, who played with the heads of aristocrats and\r\npriests as with nine-pin balls, was, as is known, very religious, whence\r\nhe ceremoniously introduced the \"Supreme Being,\" which shortly before\r\nhad, with equal bad taste, been dethroned by the Convention. And seeing\r\nthat the frivolous and idle aristocrats of France had been greatly\r\nbragging about their atheism, Robespierre regarded atheism as\r\naristocratic, and denounced it in his speech to the Convention on the\r\n\"Supreme Being\" with these words: \"Atheism is aristocratic. The idea of\r\na Supreme Being, that watches over oppressed innocence and punishes\r\ntriumphant crime, comes from the people. If there were no God, one would\r\nhave to be invented.\" The virtuous Robespierre had his misgivings\r\nconcerning the power of his virtuous republic to cancel the existing\r\nsocial antagonisms, hence his belief in a Supreme Being that wreaks\r\nvengeance and seeks to smooth the difficulties that the people of his\r\ntime were unable to smooth. Hence also was such a belief a necessity to\r\nthe first republic.\r\n\r\nOne step in progress will bring another. Mankind will ever set new\r\ntasks to itself, and the accomplishment of the same will lead it to such\r\na degree of social development that wars, religious quarrels and similar\r\nmanifestations of barbarism will be unknown.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[228] \"National and human interests stand to-day opposed to each other.\r\nAt a higher stage of civilization these interests will coincide and\r\nbecome one.\"--v. Thuenen, \"Der Isolirte Staat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V\r\n\r\nPOPULATION _and_ OVER-POPULATION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOPULATION AND OVER-POPULATION\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has become quite fashionable with people who occupy themselves with\r\nthe social question to consider the question of population as the most\r\nimportant and burning of all. They claim that we are threatened with\r\n\"over-population;\" aye, that the danger is upon us. This, more than any\r\nother division of the Social Question, must be treated from an\r\ninternational standpoint. The feeding and the distribution of the people\r\nhave pre-eminently become international issues of fact. Since Malthus,\r\nthe law underlying the increase of population has been the subject of\r\nextensive dispute. In his celebrated and now notorious \"Essay on the\r\nPrinciples of Population,\" which Marx has characterized as a\r\n\"school-boyish, superficial and pulpiteer piece of declamatory\r\nplagiarism on Sir James Stewart, Townsend, Franklin, Wallace and others\"\r\nand which \"contains not one original sentence,\" Malthus lays down the\r\nproposition that mankind has the tendency to increase in geometric\r\nprogression (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc.), while food could increase only\r\nin arithmetic progression (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.); and that the\r\nconsequence is a rapid disproportion between the numbers of the\r\npopulation and the supply of food, that inevitably leads to want and\r\nstarvation. The final conclusion was the necessity of \"abstinence\" in\r\nthe procreation of children, and abstinence from marriage without\r\nsufficient means for the support of a family, contrariwise there would\r\nbe no place at \"the banquet table of Nature\" for the descendants.\r\n\r\nThe fear of over-population is very old. It was touched upon in this\r\nwork in connection with the social conditions of the Greeks and Romans,\r\nand at the close of the Middle Ages. Plato and Aristotle, the Romans,\r\nthe small bourgeois of the Middle Ages were all swayed by it, and it\r\neven swayed Voltaire, who, in the first quarter of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, published a treatise on the subject. The fear ever turns up\r\nagain--this circumstance must be emphasized--_at periods when the\r\nexisting social conditions are disintegrating and breaking down_. Seeing\r\non all sides privation and discontent at such periods, the privation and\r\ndiscontent are forthwith ascribed to the shortness of the supply of\r\nfood, instead of to the manner in which the existing supply is\r\ndistributed.\r\n\r\nAll advanced social stages have hitherto rested upon class-rule, and the\r\nprincipal means of class-rule was the appropriation of the land. The\r\nland gradually slips from the hands of a large number of proprietors\r\ninto those of a small number that utilize and cultivate it only\r\npartially. The large majority are rendered propertyless and are stripped\r\nof the means of existence; their share of food then depends upon the\r\ngood will of their masters, for whom they now have to work. According to\r\nthe social condition of things, the struggle for the land takes its form\r\nfrom period to period; the end, however, was that the land continued\r\nsteadily to concentrate in the hands of the ruling class. If undeveloped\r\nmeans of transportation or political isolation impede the intercourse\r\nabroad of a community and interfere with the importation of food when\r\nthe crops fail and provisions are dear, forthwith the belief springs up\r\nthat there are too many people. Under such circumstances, every increase\r\nin the family is felt as a burden; the specter of over-population rises;\r\nand the terror that it spreads is in direct proportion to the\r\nconcentration of the land in few hands, together with its train of\r\nevils--the partial cultivation of the soil, and its being turned to\r\npurposes of pleasure for its owners. Rome and Italy were poorest off for\r\nfood at the time when the whole soil of Italy was held by about 3,000\r\nlatifundia owners. Hence the cry: \"The latifundia are ruining Rome!\" The\r\nsoil was converted into vast hunting-grounds and wonderful\r\npleasure-gardens; not infrequently it was allowed to be idle, seeing\r\nthat its cultivation, even by slaves, came out dearer to the magnates\r\nthan the grain imported from Sicily and Africa. It was a state of things\r\nthat opened wide the doors for usury in grain, a practice in which the\r\nrich nobility likewise led. In consideration of this usury of grain the\r\ndomestic soil was kept from cultivation. Thereupon the impoverished\r\nRoman citizen and the impoverished aristocracy resolved to renounce\r\nmarriage and the begetting of children; hence the laws placing premiums\r\non marriage and children in order to check the steady decrease of the\r\nruling classes.\r\n\r\nThe same phenomenon appeared towards the close of the Middle Ages, after\r\nthe nobility and clergy had, in the course of centuries and with the aid\r\nof all the crafty and violent means at their command, robbed unnumbered\r\npeasants of their property and appropriated the common lands to\r\nthemselves. When, thereupon, the peasants revolted and were beaten down,\r\nthe robber-trade gained new impetus, and it was then also practiced upon\r\nthe Church estates by the Princes of the Reformation. The number of\r\nthieves, beggars and vagabonds was never larger than immediately before\r\nand after the Reformation. The expropriated rural population rushed to\r\nthe cities; but there, due to causes that have been described in\r\nprevious pages, the conditions of life were likewise\r\ndeteriorating,--hence \"over-population\" was felt all around.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of Malthus coincides with that period of English industry\r\nwhen, due to the inventions of Hargreaves, Arkwright and Watt, powerful\r\nchanges set in both in mechanism and technique, changes that affected,\r\nfirst of all, the cotton and linen industries, and rendered breadless\r\nthe workingmen engaged in them. The concentration of capital and land\r\nassumed at the time large proportions in England: along with the rapid\r\nincrease of wealth, on the one hand, there went the deepening misery of\r\nthe masses, on the other. At such a juncture, the ruling classes, who\r\nhave every reason to consider the existing world the \"best of all\r\npossible worlds,\" were bound to seek an explanation for so contradictory\r\na phenomenon as the pauperization of the masses in the midst of swelling\r\nwealth and flourishing industry. Nothing was easier than to throw the\r\nblame upon the too-rapid procreation of the workingmen, and not upon\r\ntheir having been rendered superfluous through the capitalist process of\r\nproduction, and the accumulation of the soil in the hands of landlords.\r\nWith such circumstances for its setting, the \"school-boyish, superficial\r\nand pulpiteer piece of declamatory plagiarism,\" that Malthus published,\r\nwas a work that gave drastic utterance to the secret thoughts and wishes\r\nof the ruling class, and justified their misdeeds to the world. Hence\r\nthe loud applause that it met from one side, and violent opposition from\r\nanother. Malthus had spoken the right word at the right time for the\r\nEnglish bourgeoisie; hence, although his essay \"contained not one\r\noriginal sentence,\" he became a great and celebrated man, and his name a\r\nsynonym for the doctrine.[229]\r\n\r\nNow, then, the conditions that caused Malthus thus to give his signal of\r\nalarm and proclaim his brutal doctrine--he addressed it to the working\r\nclass, thus adding insult to injury--have since grown worse from decade\r\nto decade. They have grown worse, not alone in the fatherland of\r\nMalthus, Great Britain, but in all the countries of the world run by the\r\ncapitalist system of production, whose consequences ever are the robbery\r\nof the soil and the dependence and subjugation of the masses through\r\nmachinery and the factory. This system consists, as has been shown, in\r\nthe separation of the workingman from his means of production--be these\r\nland or tools--and in the transfer of the latter to the capitalist\r\nclass. That system produces ever new branches of industry, develops and\r\nconcentrates them, and thereby throws ever larger masses of the people\r\nupon the street as \"superfluous.\" On the field of agriculture it\r\npromotes, as the Rome of old, the latifundia ownership with all its\r\nsequences. Ireland, in this respect the classic land of Europe, and\r\nafflicted worst of all by the English system of land-grabbing, had in\r\n1887 an area of 884.4 square miles of meadow and pasture land, but only\r\n263.3 square miles of agricultural fields and the conversion of\r\nagricultural fields into meadows and pastures for sheep and cattle and\r\ninto hunting grounds for the landlords makes every year further\r\nstrides.[230]\r\n\r\nMoreover the agricultural fields of Ireland are, in great measure, in\r\nthe hands of a large number of small tenants, who are not able to\r\ncultivate the land in the most profitable manner. Thus Ireland presents\r\nthe aspect of a country that is retrogressing from an agricultural into\r\na pastoral condition. The population, that at the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century was over eight million strong, has declined to about\r\nfive million, and still several millions are \"in excess.\" Ireland's\r\nnormal state of rebellion against England is thus easily explained; and\r\nyet the struggle of the \"Home Ruler\" aims only at the creation of an\r\nIrish landlord class and no wise carries the wished-for deliverance to\r\nthe mass of the Irish people. The Irish people will perceive that so\r\nsoon as the Home Ruler shall carry out his plans. Scotland presents a\r\npicture similar to that of Ireland with regard to the ownership and\r\ncultivation of its soil.[231]\r\n\r\nA similar development reappears in Hungary, a country that entered upon\r\nthe modern field of development only recently. Hungary, a land in point\r\nof the fertility of her soil, as rich as few in Europe, is overloaded\r\nwith debt, and her population, pauperized and in the hands of usurers,\r\nemigrates in large numbers. Hungary's soil is now concentrated in the\r\nhands of modern capitalist magnates, who carry on a ruinous system of\r\ncultivation in forest and field so that Hungary is not far from the\r\ntime when it will have ceased to be a grain exporting country. It is\r\nquite similarly with Italy. In Italy, just as in Germany, the political\r\nunity of the nation has taken capitalist development powerfully under\r\nthe arm; but the thrifty peasants of Piedmont and Lombardy, of Tuscany,\r\nRomagna and Sicily are ever more impoverished and go to ruin. Swamps and\r\nmoors are reappearing on the sites occupied but recently by the well\r\ncultivated gardens and fields of small peasants. Before the very gates\r\nof Rome, in the so-called Campagna, a hundred thousand hectares of land\r\nlie fallow in a region that once was the \"garden of Rome.\" Swamps cover\r\nthe ground, and exhale their poisonous miasmas. If, with the application\r\nof the proper means the Campagna were thoroughly drained and properly\r\nirrigated, the population of Rome would have a fertile source of food.\r\nBut Italy suffers of the ambition to become a \"leading power:\" she is\r\nruining herself with military and naval armaments and with African\r\ncolonization plans, and, consequently, has no funds left for such tasks\r\nas the reclaiming of the Campagna for cultivation. And as the Campagna,\r\nso are South Italy and particularly Sicily. The latter, once the granary\r\nof Rome, sinks ever more into deepening poverty. There is no more\r\nsucked-out, poverty-stricken and maltreated people in all Europe than\r\nthe Sicilian. The easily-contented sons of the most beautiful region of\r\nall Europe overrun half Europe and the United States as lowerers of\r\nwages because they care not to starve to death upon the native soil that\r\nhas ceased to be their property. Malaria, that frightful fever, is\r\nspreading over Italy to an extent that, frightened at the prospect, the\r\ngovernment instituted in 1882 an investigation, which brought to light\r\nthe deplorable fact that, of the 69 provinces of the country, 32 were\r\nseverely afflicted by the disease, 32 were infected, and only 5 had so\r\nfar remained free. The disease, once known only in the rural districts,\r\npenetrated the cities, where the urban, increased by the rural\r\nproletariat, constitutes a center of infection.\r\n\r\nThese facts, together with what has been said touching the effects and\r\nresults of the capitalist system of production, teach us that want and\r\nmisery with the masses are not the results of insufficiency in the means\r\nof existence, but of an unequal distribution, that furnishes some with a\r\nsuperfluity and condemns others to privation. It causes the destruction\r\nand squandering of supplies, and, along with that, negligence in\r\nproducing these. The Malthusian assertions have sense only from the\r\nstandpoint of the system of capitalist production. Whoever stands on\r\nthat principle has every reason to defend it, otherwise the ground would\r\nslip from under him.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, however, the capitalist system itself favors the\r\nproduction of children, in so far as it needs cheap \"hands\" in the shape\r\nof such in its factories. The begetting of children, moreover, often\r\nbecomes a matter of calculation with the proletariat. They cost the\r\nparents little or nothing: they soon earn their own support. In the\r\nhouse industries the proletarian is even obliged to have many children:\r\nthey equip him all the better for the competitive struggle. It certainly\r\nis an abominable system: it conceals the pauperization of the workingman\r\nand it provokes his own rendering of himself superfluous through the\r\nchildren who work for the most miserable of wages. The immorality and\r\nharmfulness of this system are obvious, and they spread with the\r\nextension of capitalism. It is precisely for that reason that the\r\nbourgeois ideologists--and all bourgeois economists are that--defend the\r\nMalthusian theories. Hence in Germany also and in particular the notion\r\nof \"over-production\" ever finds support among the bourgeoisie. Capital\r\nis the innocent defendant, the workingman is the criminal.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, for this theory Germany has \"superfluity,\" not\r\nof proletarians only, but also of \"intellectuals.\" Capital brings about\r\nnot only an over-production of soil, goods, workingmen, women and\r\nchildren, but also of \"officials and learning\"--as we shall show. There\r\nis only one thing that is not \"superfluous\" in this capitalist\r\nworld--capital and its owner, the capitalist.\r\n\r\nIf the capitalist economists are Malthusians they are simply what their\r\ncapitalist interests compel them to be. Only, they should not shift\r\ntheir bourgeois whims to the shoulders of Socialist society. John Stuart\r\nMill says among other things: \"But Communism is precisely the state of\r\nthings in which opinion might be expected to declare itself with\r\ngreatest intensity against this kind of selfish intemperance. An\r\naugmentation of numbers which diminished the comfort or increased the\r\ntoil of the mass, would then cause (which now it does not) immediate and\r\nunmistakable inconvenience to every individual in the association;\r\ninconvenience which could not then be imputed to the avarice of\r\nemployers, or the unjust privileges of the rich. In such altered\r\ncircumstances, opinion could not fail to reprobate, and if reprobation\r\ndid not suffice, to repress by penalties of some description, this or\r\nany other culpable self-indulgence at the expense of the community. The\r\nCommunistic scheme, instead of being peculiarly open to the objection\r\ndrawn from danger of over-population, has the recommendation of tending\r\nin an especial degree to the prevention of that evil.\" And Prof. Ad.\r\nWagner says: \"Least of all could freedom of marriage or freedom of\r\nprocreation be tolerated in a Socialist community.\"[232] These authors\r\nproceed from the theory that the tendency towards over-population is\r\none common to all social conditions, but both allow that Socialism is\r\nbetter able than any other social system to establish the equilibrium\r\nbetween population and food. The latter is true, not so the former.\r\n\r\nTrue enough, there were one time Socialists, who, tainted by the\r\nMalthusian theories, perceived the \"imminent danger\" of over-population.\r\nBut these Socialist Malthusians have disappeared. A clearer insight into\r\nthe nature of bourgeois society, together with the fact that, judging\r\nfrom the plaintive songs of our Agrarians, we produce not too little but\r\ntoo much food, and that the resulting low prices render the production\r\nof foodstuffs unprofitable, has enlightened them on the subject.\r\n\r\nA part of our Malthusians imagine--and the chorus of the mouth-pieces of\r\nthe bourgeoisie parrot-like echo their utterances--that a Socialist\r\nsociety, in which there is freedom in the choice of love and ample\r\nprovision for a livelihood worthy of human beings, must soon degenerate\r\ninto a rabbit warren: it would succumb to excessive sexual indulgence\r\nand to excessive procreation. Exactly the reverse is most likely to\r\nhappen, as certain observations go to prove. Until now the largest\r\nnumber of children were had, not by the best, but by the worst situated.\r\nIt may even be said without being guilty of exaggeration: the poorer the\r\ncondition of a proletarian stratum, the more numerous also is its\r\naverage blessing of children, conceding exceptions here and there. Even\r\nVirchow confirms this. He says: \"As the English workingman in his\r\ndeepest degradation, in the utter vacancy of the mind, finally knows but\r\ntwo sources of enjoyment, drunkenness and coition, so did the population\r\nof Upper Silesia, until recent years, concentrate all its wishes, all\r\nits desires upon these two things. Liquor and the gratification of\r\nsexual cravings had become sovereign with it. Hence it is easy to\r\nunderstand that its population gained as rapidly in numbers as it lost\r\nin physical vigor and moral fibre.\" Karl Marx expresses himself\r\nsimilarly when he says in \"Capital:\" \"As a matter of fact, not only the\r\nnumber of births and deaths but the absolute size of families is in\r\nreverse ratio to the height of wages, i. e., to the means of subsistence\r\nwhich the various categories of workmen have at their disposal. _This\r\nlaw of capitalist society would sound absurd among savages, or even\r\ncivilized colonists._ It reminds us of the enormous power of\r\nreproduction among animals that are individually weak and much hunted\r\ndown;\" and Marx furthermore quotes Laing, who says: \"If all the world\r\nwere in comfortable circumstances, the earth would soon be depopulated.\"\r\nWe see Laing's views are opposed to Malthus: he is of the opinion that a\r\ngood living is not conducive to the increase but to the decrease of\r\nbirths. In the same vein says Herbert Spencer: \"Always and everywhere\r\nprogress and procreative capacity are opposed to each other. It follows\r\nthat the higher development, that mankind looks forward to, will\r\nprobably have as a result a decline in procreation.\"\r\n\r\nThus we see men, who otherwise differ, absolutely at one on this head,\r\nand their views coincide wholly with ours.\r\n\r\nThe whole question of population could be practically disposed of off\r\nhand with the observation that there is no danger of over-population\r\nwithin sight: we find ourselves in front of such a superabundance of\r\nfood, which even threatens to increase, that the greatest worry, now\r\nafflicting the producers of means of subsistence, is to furnish this\r\nwealth of food at tolerable prices. A rapid increase of consumers would\r\neven be the most desirable thing for producers. But our Malthusians are\r\ntireless in the raising of objections: thus we are forced to meet these,\r\nlest they have the excuse that they can not be refuted.\r\n\r\nThey claim that the danger of an over-population in a not-distant future\r\nlies in the law of a \"decreasing yield of the soil.\" Our fields become\r\n\"tired of cultivation;\" increasing crops are no longer to be looked for;\r\nseeing that fields, fit for cultivation, become daily rarer, the danger\r\nof a scarcity of food is imminent, if the population continue to\r\nincrease. We believe to have proved beyond doubt, in the passages on the\r\nagricultural utilization of the soil, what enormous progress mankind can\r\nmake with respect to the acquisition of new masses of nutriment. But we\r\nshall give further illustrations. A very able landlord of wide acres and\r\neconomist of acknowledged worth, a man, accordingly who excelled Malthus\r\nin both respects, said as early as 1850--a time when chemical\r\nagriculture was still in its swaddling clothes--on the subject of\r\nagricultural production: \"The productivity of raw products, especially\r\nfoodstuffs, will in future no longer lag behind the productivity of the\r\nfactory and of transportation.... Chemical agriculture has only started\r\nin our days to open to agriculture prospects that will no doubt lead to\r\nmany false roads, but that in the end will place the production of\r\nfoodstuffs as fully in the power of society, as it lies now in its power\r\nto furnish yards of cloth, if but the requisite supply of wool is at\r\nhand.\"[233]\r\n\r\nJustus v. Liebig, the founder of chemical agriculture, holds that \"if\r\nhuman labor and manure are available in sufficient quantity, the soil is\r\ninexhaustible, and can yield uninterruptedly the richest harvests.\" The\r\n\"law of a decreasing yield of the soil\" is a Malthusian notion, that had\r\nits justification at a time when agriculture was in an undeveloped\r\nstate; the notion has long since been refuted by science and\r\nexperience. The law is rather this: \"The yield of a soil stands in\r\ndirect ratio to the human labor expended (science and technique being\r\nincluded), and to the proper fertilizers applied to it.\" If it was\r\npossible for small-peasant France to more than quadruple the yield of\r\nher soil during the last ninety years, without the population even\r\ndoubling, much better results are to be expected from a Socialist\r\nsociety. Our Malthusians, furthermore, overlook the fact that, under our\r\nexisting conditions, not our soil merely is to be taken into account,\r\nbut the soil of the whole earth, that is, to a great extent, territories\r\nwhose fertility yields twenty, thirty and many more times as much as our\r\ncorresponding fields of the same size. The earth is now extensively\r\nappropriated by man; nevertheless, a small fraction excepted, it is\r\nnowhere cultivated and utilized as it could be cultivated and utilized.\r\nNot Great Britain alone could, as has been shown, produce a much larger\r\nquantity of food than she does to-day, but France, Germany, Austria and\r\nto a still much greater extent the other countries of Europe also could\r\ndo the same. In little Wurtemberg, with her 879,970 hectares of grain\r\nsoil, the mere application of the steam plow would raise the average\r\ncrop of 6,410,000 to 9,000,000 cwts.\r\n\r\nEuropean Russia--measured by the present standard of the population of\r\nGermany--would be able to nourish, instead of her present population, of\r\n90,000,000, one of 475,000,000 souls. To-day European Russia has about\r\n1,000 inhabitants to the square mile, Saxony over 12,000.\r\n\r\nThe objection that Russia contains vast stretches of territory, whose\r\nclimate renders impossible any higher degree of cultivation, is true; on\r\nthe other hand, however, she has to the south a climate and fertility of\r\nsoil by far unknown in Germany. Then, again, due to the denseness of\r\npopulation and the improved cultivation of soil therewith connected,\r\nsuch as clearings of woods, draining, etc., changes, wholly\r\nunmeasureable to-day, will be brought on in climate. Wherever man\r\naggregates in large numbers climatic changes are perceived. To-day we\r\nattach too little importance to this phenomenon; we are even unable to\r\nrealize the same to its full extent, seeing that we have no occasion\r\ntherefor, and, as things are to-day, lack the means to undertake the\r\nneeded experiments on an adequate scale. Furthermore, all travelers are\r\nagreed that in the high latitudes of Northern Siberia, where spring,\r\nsummer and autumn crowd together in rapid succession within a few\r\nmonths, an astonishing luxuriance of vegetation suddenly springs forth.\r\nThus Sweden and Norway, to-day so sparsely populated, would, with their\r\nmammoth woods and positively inexhaustible mineral wealth, their\r\nnumerous rivers and long stretch of coast lines, furnish rich sources of\r\nfood for a dense population. The requisite means and appliances are not\r\nobtainable under present circumstances, and thus even that sparse\r\npopulation casts off its shoals of emigrants.\r\n\r\nWhat may be said of the north applies with still more force to the south\r\nof Europe--Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece, the Danubian States, Hungary,\r\nTurkey, etc. A climate of surpassing quality, a soil so luxuriant and\r\nfertile as is hardly found in the best regions of the United States,\r\nwill some day furnish an abundance of food to unnumbered people. The\r\ndecrepit political and social conditions of those countries cause\r\nhundreds of thousands of our own people to prefer crossing the ocean\r\nrather than to settle in those much nearer and more comfortably located\r\nStates. Soon as rational social conditions and international relations\r\nwill prevail there, new millions of people will be needed to raise those\r\nlarge and fertile lands to a higher grade of civilization.\r\n\r\nIn order to be able to reach materially higher rungs on the ladder of\r\ncivilization we shall, for a long time to come, have in Europe, not a\r\nsuperfluity, but a dearth of people. Under such circumstances, it is an\r\nabsurdity to yield to the fear of over-population. It must ever be kept\r\nin mind that the utilization of existing sources of food, by the\r\napplication of science and labor, knows no limit: every day brings new\r\ndiscoveries and inventions which increase the yield of the sources of\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nIf we pass from Europe to the other parts of the earth, the lack of\r\npeople and the excess of soil is still more glaring. The most luxuriant\r\nand fruitful lands of the earth still lie wholly or almost wholly idle:\r\nthe work of bringing them under cultivation and turning them to use can\r\nnot be undertaken with a few hundred or thousand people: it demands mass\r\ncolonizations of many millions in order to be able to bring the\r\nbut-too-luxuriant Nature under human control. Under this head belong,\r\namong others, Central and South America--a territory of hundreds of\r\nthousands of square miles. Argentina, for instance, had in 1892 about\r\n5,000,000 hectares under cultivation, the country has, however,\r\n96,000,000 hectares at its disposal. The soil of South America, fit for\r\nthe cultivation of corn and lying fallow, is estimated at 200,000,000\r\nhectares, at least. The United States, Austria-Hungary, Great Britain\r\nand Ireland, Germany and France have all together only about 105,000,000\r\nhectares devoted to cereals. Carey maintains that the 360-mile long\r\nvalley of the Orinoco alone could furnish enough food to supply the\r\nwhole present human race. Let us halve the estimate, and there is still\r\nan abundance. At any rate, South America alone could feed the majority\r\nof the population now extant on earth. The nutritive value of a field\r\nplanted with banana trees and one of equal size planted with wheat\r\nstands as 133 to 1. While our wheat yields in favorable soil 12 to 20\r\ntimes its seed, rice in its home yields 80 to 100, maize 250 to 300\r\ntimes as much. In many regions, the Philippine Islands among them, the\r\nproductivity of rice is estimated at 400 times as much. The question\r\nwith all these articles of food is to render them as nourishing as\r\npossible by the manner in which they are prepared. Chemistry has in this\r\na boundless field for development.\r\n\r\nCentral and South America, especially Brazil, which alone is almost as\r\nlarge as all Europe--Brazil has 152,000 square miles with about\r\n15,000,000 inhabitants, as against Europe's 178,000 square miles and\r\nabout 340,000,000 inhabitants--are big with a luxuriance and fertility\r\nthat stir the astonishment and wonderment of all travelers, besides\r\nbeing inexhaustibly rich in minerals. Nevertheless, until now they are\r\nalmost closed to the world because their population is indolent and\r\nstands, both in point of numbers and of culture, too low to overmaster\r\nthe power of Nature. How matters look in Africa we have been enlightened\r\non by the discoveries of recent years. Even if a good part of Central\r\nAfrica never be fit for European agriculture, there are other regions of\r\nvast size that can be put to good use the moment rational principles of\r\ncolonization are applied. On the other hand, there are in Asia not only\r\nvast and fertile territories, able to feed thousands of millions of\r\npeople, but the past has also shown how in places that are there now\r\nsterile and almost desert, the mild climate once conjured up an\r\nabundance of food from the soil, provided only man knows how to lead to\r\nit the blessing-bestowing water. What with the destruction of the\r\nmarvelous aqueducts and contrivances for irrigation in Asia Minor and in\r\nthe regions of the Tigris and the Euphrates, with vandalic wars of\r\nconquest and the insane oppression of the people by the conquerors,\r\nfields, thousands of square miles wide, have been transformed into sandy\r\ndeserts. Likewise in Northern Africa, Spain, Mexico and Peru. Let there\r\nbe produced millions of civilized human beings, and inexhaustible\r\nsources of food will be unlocked. The fruit of the date tree thrives\r\nmarvelously in Asia and Africa, and it takes up so little room that 200\r\ntrees can go on one acre of land. The durria bears in Egypt more than\r\n3,000 fold, and yet the country is poor--not by reason of excessive\r\npopulation, but as the result of a robber system that accomplishes the\r\nfeat of spreading the desert ever further from decade to decade. The\r\nmarvelous results attainable in all these countries by the agriculture\r\nand horticulture of middle Europe is a matter that eludes all\r\ncalculation.\r\n\r\nWith the present state of agriculture, the United States could easily\r\nfeed fifteen and twenty times its present population (63,000,000)--that\r\nis, 1,200,000,000 people. Under the same conditions, Canada could feed,\r\ninstead of 5,000,000 people, 100,000,000 people. Then there are\r\nAustralia, the numerous and in some instances large and extraordinarily\r\nfertile islands of the great Indian Ocean, etc. \"Multiply!\"--such, and\r\nnot \"Reduce your numbers!\"--is the call that in the name of civilization\r\nreaches the human race.\r\n\r\nEverywhere, it is the social conditions--the existing method of\r\nproduction and distribution--that bring on privation and misery, not the\r\nnumber of people. A few rich crops in succession lower the prices of\r\nfood in such manner that a considerable number of our cultivators of the\r\nsoil are ruined. Instead of the condition of the cultivator being\r\nimproved, it declines. A large number of farmers to-day look upon a good\r\ncrop as a misfortune: it lowers prices so that the cost of production is\r\nbarely covered. And this is called a rational state of things! With the\r\nview of keeping far away from us the abundance of the harvests of other\r\ncountries, high duties are placed on grain: thus the entry of foreign\r\ngrain is made difficult and the price of the domestic article is raised.\r\nWe have no scarcity but a superabundance of food, the same as of\r\nindustrial products. The same as millions of people need the yield of\r\nthe factories, but can not satisfy their wants under the existing system\r\nof property and production, so are millions in want of food, being\r\nunable to pay for it, although the prices are low and the necessaries of\r\nlife abundant. We ask again, Can this be called a rational state of\r\nthings? The craziness and insanity of it all is obvious. Our speculators\r\nin corn often, when the crops are good, deliberately allow a large part\r\nto perish: they know the prices rise in the measure that the products\r\nare scarce. And yet we are told to look out for overpopulation! In\r\nRussia, southern Europe and many other countries of the world, hundreds\r\nof thousands of loads of grain perish yearly for want of proper storage\r\nand transportation. Many millions of hundredweights of food are yearly\r\nsquandered because the provisions for gathering in the crops are\r\ninadequate, or there is a scarcity of hands at the right time. Many a\r\ncorn field, many a filled barn, whole agricultural establishments are\r\nburned down, because the insurance fetches higher gains. Food and goods\r\nare destroyed for the same reason that ships are caused to go to the\r\nbottom with their whole crews.[234] A large part of the crops is yearly\r\nruined by our military manoeuvres; the costs of manoeuvres that last\r\nonly a few days run up to hundreds of thousands of marks; and there are\r\nmany of them every year. Moreover, as stated before, large fields are\r\ntaken from cultivation for these purposes.\r\n\r\nNor must it be forgotten that there is the sea yet to be added to the\r\nmeans for increasing the volume of food. The area of water is as 18 to 7\r\nto that of land,--two and a half times as large. Its enormous wealth of\r\nfood still awaits a rational system of exploitation. The future opens a\r\nprospect to mankind, wholly different from the gloomy picture drawn by\r\nour Malthusians.\r\n\r\nWho can say where the line is to be drawn to our chemical, physical,\r\nphysiologic knowledge? Who would venture to predict what giant\r\nundertakings--so considered from our modern standpoint--the people of\r\nfuture centuries will execute with the object in view of introducing\r\nmaterial changes in the climates of the nations and in the methods of\r\nexploiting their soil?\r\n\r\nWe see to-day, under the capitalist social system, undertakings executed\r\nthat were thought impossible or insane a century ago. Wide isthmuses are\r\ncut through; tunnels, miles long and bored into the bowels of the earth,\r\njoin peoples whom towering mountains separate; others are dug under the\r\nbeds of seas to shorten distances, and avoid disturbances and dangers\r\nthat otherwise the countries thus separated are exposed to. Where is the\r\nspot at which could be said: \"So far and no farther?\"\r\n\r\nIf all these improvements were to be undertaken simultaneously, we would\r\nbe found to have, not too many but too few people. The race must\r\nmultiply considerably if it is to do justice to all the tasks that are\r\nwaiting for it. Neither is the soil under cultivation utilized as it\r\nshould be, nor are there people enough to cultivate three-fourths of its\r\nface. Our relative over-production, continuously produced by the\r\ncapitalist system to the injury of the workingman and of society, will,\r\nat a higher grade of civilization, prove itself a benefit. Moreover, a\r\npopulation as large as possible is, even to-day, not an impediment to\r\nbut a promoter of progress--on the same principle that the existing\r\nover-production of goods and food, the destruction of the family by the\r\nenlisting of women and children in the factories, and the expropriation\r\nof the handicrafts and the peasantry by capital have all shown\r\nthemselves to be conditions precedent for a higher state of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the other side of the question: Do people multiply\r\nindefinitely, and is that a necessity of their being?\r\n\r\nWith the view of proving this great reproductive power of man, the\r\nMalthusians usually refer to the abnormal instances of exceptional\r\nfamilies and peoples. Nothing is proven by that. As against these\r\ninstances there are others where, under favorable conditions, complete\r\nsterility shortly sets in. The quickness with which often well situated\r\nfamilies die out is surprising. Although the United States offer more\r\nfavorable conditions than any other country for the increase of\r\npopulation, and yearly hundreds of thousands of people immigrate at the\r\nmost vigorous age, its population doubles only every thirty years. There\r\nare nowhere instances on a large scale of the assertion concerning a\r\ndoubling period of twelve or twenty years.\r\n\r\nAs indicated by the quotations from Marx and Virchow, which may be\r\nconsidered to state the rule, population increases fastest where it is\r\npoorest because, as Virchow justly claims, next to drunkenness, sexual\r\nintercourse is their only enjoyment. When Gregory VII. forced celibacy\r\nupon the clergy, the priests of lower rank in the diocese of Mainz\r\ncomplained, as stated before, that differently from the upper prelates,\r\nthey did not have all possible pleasures, and the only enjoyment left\r\nthem was their wives. A lack of varying occupation may be the reason why\r\nthe marriages of the rural clergy are, as a rule, so fruitful of\r\nchildren. It is also undeniable that our poorest districts in\r\nGermany--the Silesian Eulengebirge, the Lausitz, the Erzgebirge and\r\nFichtelgebirge, the Thuringian Forest, the Harz, etc.,--are the centers\r\nof densest population, whose chief food are potatoes. It is also certain\r\nthat sexual cravings are strong with consumptives, and these often beget\r\nchildren at a state of physical decline when such a thing would seem\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nIt is a law of Nature--hinted at in the quotations made from Herbert\r\nSpencer and Laing--that she supplies in quantity what she loses in\r\nquality. The animals of highest grade and strength--lions, elephants,\r\ncamels, etc., our domestic animals such as mares, asses, cows,--bring\r\nfew young ones into the world; while animals of lower organization\r\nincrease in inverse ratio--all insects, most fishes, etc., the smaller\r\nmammals, such as hares, rats, mice, etc. Furthermore, Darwin established\r\nthat certain wild animals, so soon as tamed, forfeit their fecundity.\r\nThe elephant is an illustration. This proves that altered conditions of\r\nlife, together with the consequent change in the mode of life, are the\r\ndetermining factors in reproductive powers.\r\n\r\nIt happens, however, that it is the Darwinians who lead in the fear of\r\nover-population, and upon whom our modern Malthusians bank. Our\r\nDarwinians are everywhere infelicitous the moment they apply their\r\ntheories to human conditions: their method then becomes roughly\r\nempirical, and they forget that, while man is the highest organic\r\nanimal, he, being in contradistinction to animals acquainted with the\r\nlaws of nature is able to direct and utilize these.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the struggle for existence, the doctrine that the germs\r\nof new life exist in much larger numbers than are maintainable with the\r\nexisting means of existence, would be wholly applicable to man if man,\r\ninstead of straining his brains and enlisting the services of technical\r\narts for exploiting air, land and water, grazed like cattle, or like\r\nmonkeys indulged his sexual impulses with cynic shamelessness,--in\r\nshort, if he reverted to the monkey order. In passing be it observed\r\nthat the fact that, besides man, monkeys are the only beings with whom\r\nthe sexual impulse is not fixed to certain periods, is a striking proof\r\nof the relationship between the two. But though closely related, they\r\nare not identical, and are not to be placed on one level and measured by\r\none standard,--a fact that we commend to Ziegler, who, in his book\r\nherein frequently referred to, holds up the two together.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance that, under the conditions of ownership and production\r\nthat have hitherto prevailed, the struggle for existence existed and\r\ncontinues to exist for man also and many fail to find the conditions for\r\nlife, is perfectly true. But these failed, not because of the scarcity\r\nof the means of existence, but because, due to social conditions, the\r\nmeans of existence, though in greatest abundance, were kept from them.\r\nFalse also is the conclusion that, because such has hitherto been the\r\nstate of things, it is unchangeable and will ever be so. It is here that\r\nthe Darwinians slide and fall: they study natural science and\r\nanthropology, but not sociology, and thoughtlessly fall in line with our\r\nbourgeois ideologists. Hence they drop into their false conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe sexual instinct is perennial in man; it is his strongest instinct\r\nand demands satisfaction, lest his health suffer. Moreover, as a rule,\r\nthis instinct is strong in proportion to man's health and normal\r\ndevelopment--just as a good appetite and a good digestion bespeak a\r\nhealthy stomach, and are the first prerequisites for a healthy body. But\r\ngratification of the sexual instinct and begetting and conceiving are\r\nnot the same thing. The most varied theories have been set up on the\r\nfecundity of the human race. On the whole, we are still groping in the\r\ndark on this important field, mainly because for a couple of thousand\r\nyears a senseless shyness has stood in the way of man's occupying\r\nhimself freely and naturally with the laws of his own origin, and to\r\nstudy thoroughly the laws of human procreation. That is gradually\r\nchanging and must change much more.\r\n\r\nOn one side the theory is set up that higher mental development and\r\nstrenuous mental exertion, in short, higher nervous activity, exert a\r\nrepressing influence upon the sexual impulse and weaken the procreative\r\npower. This is disputed by the other side. The fact is pointed to that\r\nthe better situated classes have, on an average, fewer children and\r\nthat this is not to be ascribed solely to preventive measures.\r\nUndoubtedly, intense mental occupation has a depressing influence upon\r\nthe sexual impulse, but that such occupation is indulged in by the\r\nmajority of our property classes is not so certain. On the other hand,\r\nan excess of physical labor also has a repressing influence. But all\r\nexcessive effort is harmful, and therefore objectionable.\r\n\r\nOthers, again, claim that the manner of life, especially the food eaten,\r\ncoupled with certain physical conditions on the part of the woman,\r\ndetermine the power to beget and to conceive. The nature of food more\r\nthan any other cause, this side argues, determines, as experience shows\r\nin the instance of animals also, the effectiveness of the act of\r\nprocreation. Possibly, this is in fact, the determining factor. The\r\ninfluence of the nature of nourishment on the organism of certain\r\nanimals manifests itself surprisingly with bees: they produce at will a\r\nqueen by the administering of special food. Bees, accordingly, are\r\nfurther advanced in the knowledge of sexual development than men. They\r\nhave not, probably, been sermonized for two thousand years that it is\r\n\"indecent\" and \"immoral\" to concern themselves with sexual matters.\r\n\r\nIt is also known that plants raised on good soil and well manured,\r\nthrive luxuriantly, but yield no seed. That the nature of the food has\r\nits influence upon the composition of the male sperm, and upon the\r\nfecundity of the female egg with human beings also, is hardly to be\r\ndoubted. Thus mayhap the procreative power of the population depends in\r\na high degree upon the nature of the food it lives on. Other factors,\r\nwhose nature is still but little understood, also play a role. It is a\r\nstriking circumstance that a young couple may have no children after\r\nlong years of married life, yet, having separated, and each having mated\r\nagain, both new marriages are followed by healthy children.\r\n\r\nOne factor is of leading importance in the question of population in the\r\nfuture--_the higher, freer position which all women will then occupy_.\r\nLeaving exceptions aside, intelligent and energetic women are not as a\r\nrule inclined to give life to a large number of children as \"the gift of\r\nGod,\" and to spend the best years of their own lives in pregnancy, or\r\nwith a child at their breasts. This disinclination for numerous\r\nchildren, which even now is entertained by most women, may--all the\r\nsolicitude notwithstanding that a Socialist society will bestow upon\r\npregnant women and mothers--be rather strengthened than weakened. In our\r\nopinion, there lies in this the great probability that the increase of\r\npopulation will proceed slower than in bourgeois society.\r\n\r\nOur Malthusians need really not break their heads on the future of the\r\nhuman race. Until now nations have gone down through the decline, never\r\nthrough the increase of their population. In the last analysis, the\r\nnumber of population is regulated without harmful abstinence and without\r\nunnatural preventives, in a society that lives according to the laws of\r\nNature. On this head also the future will vindicate Karl Marx. His\r\ntheory also that every period of economic development carries with it\r\nits own law of population will prove true under the rule of Socialism.\r\n\r\nThe author of the work \"Die kuenstliche Beschraenkung der Kinderzahl\"\r\n(The Artificial Limitation of Progeny)[235] claims that Socialism is\r\nplaying a tricky manoeuvre by its opposition to Malthusianism: a rapid\r\nincrease of population promotes mass proletarianization, and this, in\r\nturn, promotes discontent: if over-population is successfully checked,\r\nthe spread of Socialism would be done for, and its Socialist State,\r\ntogether with all its glory, buried for all time. Thus we see one more\r\nweapon added to the arsenal to kill Socialism with--Malthusianism. The\r\ngrandiose ignorance of the Socialist-killer Ferdy on Socialism,\r\ntranspires strongest from the following sentence, which he perpetrates\r\non page 40 of his work:\r\n\r\n\"Socialism will go further than the Neo-Malthusians in its demands. It\r\nwill demand that the minimum wage be so fixed that every workingman\r\nshall be able to produce as many children as possible under given social\r\nfacilities for the acquisition of food.... The moment the ultimate\r\ndeductions of Socialism are drawn, and private property is abolished,\r\neven the dullest will then say to himself: 'Why should I have to work\r\nlong and hard for the simple reason that it pleases my neighbors to\r\nshove a dozen new members into society?'\" It should seem that a critic\r\nshould first acquaint himself with the A B C of Socialism before\r\npresuming to write upon the subject, and such preposterous stuff at\r\nthat!\r\n\r\nIn Socialist society, where alone mankind will be truly free and planted\r\non its natural basis, it will direct its own development knowingly along\r\nthe line of natural law. In all epochs hitherto, society handled the\r\nquestions of production and distribution, as well as of the increase of\r\npopulation without the knowledge of the laws that underlie them,--hence,\r\nunconsciously. In the new social order, equipped with the knowledge of\r\nthe laws of its own development, society will proceed consciously and\r\nplanfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SOCIALISM IS SCIENCE, APPLIED WITH FULL UNDERSTANDING\r\n             TO ALL THE FIELDS OF HUMAN ACTIVITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[229] That Darwin and others also became devotees of Malthus only proves\r\nhow the lack of economic knowledge leads to one-sided views.\r\n\r\n[230] Fred. Freiligrath sings in his fervid poem \"Ireland\":\r\n\r\n\r\n    Thus naught the Irish landlord cares,\r\n      While hart and ox by peasant's toil\r\n    For him are raised--he leaves undried\r\n      Great bogs and swamps on Erin's soil--\r\n\r\n    Extensive mirelands unreclaimed,\r\n      Where sheaf by sheaf rich crops could wave;\r\n    He vilely leaves--a wanton waste--\r\n      Where water-fowl and wild ducks lave.\r\n\r\n        Four million acres feels his rod;\r\n        A wilderness accursed of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n[231] \"Two millions of acres ... totally laid waste, embracing within\r\ntheir area some of the most fertile lands of Scotland.

The\r\ndeer forest of Ben Aulder was by far the best grazing ground in the wide\r\ndistrict of Badenoch; a part of the Black Mount forest was the best\r\npasture for black-faced sheep in Scotland. Some idea of the ground laid\r\nwaste for purely sporting purposes in Scotland may be formed from the\r\nfact that it embraced an area larger than the whole county of Perth. The\r\nresources of the forest of Ben Aulder might give some idea of the loss\r\nsustained from the forced desolations.

You ornament your horses\r\nwith costly and smooth coverlets, and you despise your brother who is\r\ncovered with rags. You allow your corn to rot and be devoured in your\r\nbarns and your fields, and you do not spare even a look for those who\r\nhave no bread.\" Moral homiletics have since old done precious little\r\ngood with the ruling class, and they will do no better in the future.\r\nLet the social conditions be changed so that none can act unjustly\r\ntowards his fellowman; the world will then get along easy enough.\r\n\r\n[235] Hans Ferdy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VI\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur arguments have shown that, with Socialism, the issue is not an\r\narbitrary tearing down and raising up, but a natural process of\r\ndevelopment. All the factors active in the process of destruction, on\r\nthe one hand, and of construction, on the other, _are factors that\r\noperate in the manner that they are bound to operate_. Neither\r\n\"statesmen of genius\" nor \"inflammatory demagogues\" can direct events at\r\nwill. They may imagine they push; but are themselves pushed. But we are\r\nnear the time when \"the hour has sounded.\"\r\n\r\nDue to her own peculiar development, Germany, more than any other\r\ncountry, seems designated as that which is to assume the leading _role_\r\nin the pending revolution.[236]\r\n\r\nIn the course of this work we often spoke of an over-production of\r\ngoods, which brings on the crises. This is a phenomenon peculiar to the\r\ncapitalist world only; it was seen at no previous period of human\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nBut the capitalist world yields not merely an over-production of goods\r\nand of men, it also yields _an over-production of intelligence_. Germany\r\nis the classic land in which this over-production of intelligence, which\r\nthe bourgeois world no longer knows what to do with, is yielded on a\r\nlarge scale. A circumstance, that for centuries was a misfortune to\r\nGermany's development, has largely contributed to this state of things.\r\nIt consisted in the multiplicity of small States and the check exercised\r\nby these political formations upon the development of upper capitalism.\r\nThe multiplicity of small States decentralized the intellectual life of\r\nthe nation: it raised numerous small centers of culture, and these\r\nexercised their influence upon the whole. In comparison with a large\r\ncentral government, the numerous small ones required an extraordinarily\r\nlarge administrative apparatus, whose members needed a certain degree of\r\nhigher culture. Thus high schools and universities sprung up more\r\nnumerous than in any other country of Europe. The jealousy and ambition\r\nof the several governments played in this no small _role_. The same\r\nthing repeated itself when some governments began introducing compulsory\r\neducation for the people. The passion not to be left behind a\r\nneighboring State had here its good effect. The demand for intelligence\r\nrose when increasing culture, hand in hand with the material progress of\r\nthe bourgeoisie, quickened the longing for political activity, popular\r\nrepresentation and self-government on the part of municipalities. These\r\nwere small governmental bodies for small countries and circles,\r\nnevertheless they contributed towards the general schooling, and caused\r\nthe sons of the bourgeoisie to covet seats in them and to adapt their\r\neducation accordingly.\r\n\r\nAs science, so did art fare.--No country of Europe has, relatively\r\nspeaking, so many painting and other art academies, technical schools,\r\nmuseums and art collections, as Germany. Other countries may be able to\r\nmake better showings in their capitals, but none has such a distribution\r\nover its whole territory as Germany. In point of art, Italy is the only\r\nexception.\r\n\r\nWhile the bourgeoisie of England had conquered a controlling power over\r\nthe State as early as the middle of the seventeenth, and the bourgeoisie\r\nof France towards the end of the eighteenth century, the bourgeoisie of\r\nGermany did not succeed until 1848 to secure for itself a comparatively\r\nmoderate influence over the government. That was the birth year of the\r\nGerman bourgeoisie as a self-conscious class: it now stepped upon the\r\nstage as an independent political party, in the trappings of\r\n\"liberalism.\" The peculiar development that Germany had undergone now\r\nmanifested itself. It was not manufacturers, merchants, men of commerce\r\nand finance who came forward as leaders, but chiefly professors, squires\r\nof liberal proclivities, writers, jurists and doctors of all academic\r\nfaculties. It was the German ideologists: And so was their work. After\r\n1848 the German bourgeoisie was temporarily consigned to political\r\nsilence; but they utilized the period of the sepulchral silence of the\r\nfifties in the promotion of their task. The breaking-out of the\r\nAustro-Italian war and the commencement of the Regency of Prussia,\r\nstirred the bourgeoisie anew to reach after political power. The\r\n\"National Verein\" (National Union) movement began. The bourgeoisie was\r\nnow too far developed to tolerate within the numerous separate States\r\nthe many political barriers, that were at the same time\r\neconomic--barriers of taxation, barriers of communication. It assumed a\r\nrevolutionary air. Herr von Bismarck understood the situation and turned\r\nit to account in his own manner so as to reconcile the interests of the\r\nbourgeoisie with those of the Prussian Kingdom, towards which the\r\nbourgeoisie never had been hostile, seeing it feared the revolution and\r\nthe masses. The barriers finally came down that had hampered its\r\nmaterial progress. Thanks to Germany's great wealth in coal and\r\nminerals, together with an intelligent and easily satisfied working\r\nclass, the bourgeoisie made within few decades such gigantic progress as\r\nwas made by the bourgeoisie of no other country, the United States\r\nexcepted, within the same period. Thus did Germany reach the position of\r\nthe second industrial and commercial State in Europe; and she covets the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nThis rapid material development had its obverse. The system of mutual\r\nexclusion, that existed between the German States up to the\r\nestablishment of German unity, had until then furnished a living to an\r\nuncommonly numerous class of artisans and small peasants. With the\r\nprecipitous tearing down of all the protective barriers, these people\r\nsuddenly found themselves face to face with an unbridled process of\r\ncapitalist production and development. At first, the prosperity epoch of\r\nthe early seventies caused the danger to seem slighter, but it raged all\r\nthe more fearful when the crisis set in. The bourgeoisie had used the\r\nprosperity period to make marvelous progress, and thus now caused the\r\ndistress to be felt ten-fold. From now on the chasm between the\r\nproperty-holding and the propertyless classes widened rapidly. This\r\nprocess of decomposition and of absorption, which--promoted by the\r\ngrowth of material power on the one hand, and the declining power of\r\nresistance on the other--proceeds with ever increasing rapidity, throws\r\nwhole classes of the population into ever more straitened circumstances.\r\nThey find themselves from day to day more powerfully threatened in their\r\nposition and their condition of life; and they see themselves doomed\r\nwith mathematical certainty.\r\n\r\nIn this desperate struggle many seek possible safety in a change of\r\nprofession. The old men can no longer make the change: only in the\r\nrarest instances are they able to bequeath an independence to their\r\nchildren: the last efforts are made, the last means applied towards\r\nplacing sons and daughters in positions with fixed salaries, which\r\nrequire no capital to carry on. These are mainly the civil service\r\noffices in the Empire, States or municipalities--teacherships, the Post\r\nOffice and railroad positions, and also the higher places in the service\r\nof the bourgeoisie in the counting rooms, stores and factories as\r\nmanagers, chemists, technical overseers, engineers, constructors, etc.;\r\nfinally the so-called liberal professions: law, medicine, theology,\r\njournalism, art, architecture and lastly pedagogy.\r\n\r\nThousands upon thousands, who had previously taken up a trade, now--the\r\npossibility of independence and of a tolerable livelihood having\r\nvanished--seek for any position in the said offices. The pressure is\r\ntowards higher education and learning. High schools, gymnasiums,\r\npolytechnics, etc., spring up like mushrooms, and those in existence are\r\nfilled to overflowing. In the same measure the number of students at the\r\nuniversities, at the chemical and physical laboratories, at the art\r\nschools, trade and commercial schools and the higher schools of all\r\nsorts for women are on the increase. In all departments, without\r\nexception, there is a tremendous overcrowding, and the stream still\r\nswells: fresh demands are constantly raised for the establishment of\r\nmore gymnasiums and high schools to accommodate the large number of\r\npupils and students.[237] From official and private sources warnings\r\nupon warnings are issued, now against the choice of one then against\r\nthat of another career. Even theology, that a few decades ago threatened\r\nto dry up for want of candidates, now receives its spray from the\r\nsuperabundance, and again sees its livings filled. \"I am ready to preach\r\nbelief in ten thousand gods and devils, if required, only procure me a\r\nposition that may support me\"--that is the song that re-echoes from all\r\ncorners. Occasionally, the corresponding Cabinet Minister refuses his\r\nconsent to the establishment of new institutions of higher education\r\n\"because those in existence amply supply the demand for candidates of\r\nall professions.\"\r\n\r\nThis state of things is rendered all the more intolerable by the\r\ncircumstance that the competitive and mutually destructive struggle of\r\nthe bourgeoisie compels its own sons to seek for public places.\r\nFurthermore, the ever increasing standing army with its swarms of\r\nofficers, whose promotion is seriously paralyzed after a long peace,\r\nleads to the placing of large numbers of men in the best years of their\r\nlives upon the pension lists, who thereupon, favored by the State, seek\r\nall manner of appointments. Another swarm of lower grade in the army,\r\ntakes the bread from the mouths of the other stratas. Lastly, the still\r\nlarger swarm of children of the Imperial, State and municipal officials\r\nof all degrees are and can not choose but be trained especially for such\r\npositions in the civil service. Social standing, culture and\r\npretensions--all combine to keep the children of these classes away from\r\nthe so-called low occupations, which, however, as a result of the\r\ncapitalist system, are themselves overcrowded.\r\n\r\nThe system of One Year Volunteers, which allows the reduction of the\r\ncompulsory military service to one instead of two or three years for\r\nthose who have obtained a certain degree of education and can make the\r\nmaterial sacrifice, is another source from which the candidates for\r\npublic office is swollen. Many sons of well-to-do peasants, who do not\r\nfancy a return to the village and to the pursuit of their fathers, come\r\nunder this category.\r\n\r\nAs a result of all these circumstances, Germany has an infinitely more\r\nnumerous proletariat of scholars and artists than any other country, as\r\nalso a strong proletariat in the so-called liberal professions. This\r\nproletariat is steadily on the increase, and carries the fermentation\r\nand discontent with existing conditions into the higher strata of\r\nsociety. This youth are roused and spurred to the criticism of the\r\nexisting order, and they materially aid in hastening the general work of\r\ndissolution. Thus the existing condition of things is attacked and\r\nundermined from all sides.\r\n\r\nAll these circumstances have contributed to cause the German Social\r\nDemocratic party to take a hand in the leadership of the giant struggle\r\nof the future. It was German Socialists who discovered the motor laws of\r\nmodern society, and who scientifically demonstrated Socialism to be the\r\nsocial form of the future. First of all Karl Marx and Frederick Engels;\r\nnext to them and firing the masses with his agitation, Ferdinand\r\nLassalle. Finally German Socialists are the chief pioneers of Socialist\r\nthought among the workingmen of all nations.\r\n\r\nAlmost half a century ago--grounded on his studies of the German mind\r\nand culture--Buckle could say that, although Germany had a large number\r\nof the greatest thinkers, there was no country in which the chasm\r\nbetween the class of the scholars and the mass of the population was as\r\nwide. This is no longer true. It was so only so long as knowledge was\r\nconfined to learned circles that stood aloof from practical life. Since\r\nGermany has been economically revolutionized, science was compelled to\r\nrender itself useful to practical life. Science itself became practical.\r\nIt was felt that science attained its full worth only when it became\r\napplicable to human life; and the development of large capitalist\r\nproduction compelled it thereto. All the tranches of science have been,\r\naccordingly, strongly democratized during the last decades. The large\r\nnumber of young men, educated for the higher professions, contributed to\r\ncarry science among the people; then also the general schooling, higher\r\nto-day in Germany than in most European countries, facilitated the\r\npopular reception of a mass of intellectual products. But above all, the\r\nSocialist Movement--with its literature, its press, its unions and\r\nmeetings, its parliamentary representation, and finally the incessant\r\ncriticism thereby promoted on all the fields of public life--materially\r\nraised the mental level of the masses.\r\n\r\nThe exclusion law against the Social Democratic party did not check this\r\ncurrent. It somewhat hemmed in the Movement, and slightly reduced its\r\ntempo. But, on the other hand, it caused the roots of the Movement to\r\nsink deeper, and aroused an intense bitterness against the ruling\r\nclasses and the government. The final abandonment of the exclusion law\r\nwas but the consequence of the progress made by the Social Democratic\r\nparty under that very law, together with the economic development of the\r\nnation. And thus the Movement goes marching onward, as march it must\r\nunder existing conditions.\r\n\r\nAs in Germany, the Socialist Movement has made unexpected progress in\r\nall European civilized nations, a fact eloquently attested to by the\r\nInternational Congresses of Labor, which, with intervals of two or three\r\nyears, gather with ever increased representations.\r\n\r\nThus with the close of the nineteenth century the great battle of minds\r\nis on in all the countries of civilization, and is conducted with fiery\r\nenthusiasm. Along with social science, the wide field of the natural\r\nsciences, hygiene, the history of civilization and even philosophy are\r\nthe arsenals from which the weapons are drawn. The foundations of\r\nexisting society are being assailed from all sides; heavy blows are\r\nbeing dealt to its props. Revolutionary ideas penetrate conservative\r\ncircles and throw the ranks of our enemies into disorder. Artisans and\r\nscholars, farmers, and artists, merchants and government employes, here\r\nand there, even manufacturers and bankers, in short, men of all\r\nconditions, are joining the ranks of the workingmen, who constitute the\r\nbulk of the army, who combat for victory, and who will win it. All\r\nsupport and mutually supplement one another.\r\n\r\nTo woman also in general, and as a female proletarian in particular, the\r\nsummons goes out not to remain behind in this struggle in which her\r\nredemption and emancipation are at stake. It is for her to prove that\r\nshe has comprehended her true place in the Movement and in the struggles\r\nof the present for a better future; and that she is resolved to join. It\r\nis the part of the men to aid her in ridding herself of all\r\nsuperstitions, and to step forward in their ranks. Let none underrate\r\nhis own powers, and imagine that the issue does not depend upon him.\r\nNone, be he the weakest, can be spared in the struggle for the progress\r\nof the human race. The unremitting dropping of little drops hollows in\r\nthe end the hardest stone. Many drops make a brook, brooks make rivers,\r\nmany rivers a stream, until finally no obstacle is strong enough to\r\ncheck it in its majestic flow. Just so with the career of mankind.\r\nEverywhere Nature is our instructress. If all who feel the call put\r\ntheir whole strength in this struggle, ultimate victory can not fail.\r\n\r\nAnd this victory will be all the greater the more zealously and\r\nself-sacrificingly each pursues the marked-out path. None may allow\r\nhimself to be troubled with misgivings whether, despite all sacrifices,\r\nlabor and pains he will live to see the beginning of the new and fairer\r\nperiod of civilization, whether he will yet taste the fruit of victory;\r\nleast of all may such misgivings hold him back. We can foresee neither\r\nthe duration nor the nature of the several phases of development that\r\nthis struggle for the highest aims may traverse until final\r\nvictory,--any more than we have any certainty on the duration of our own\r\nlives. Nevertheless, just as the pleasure in life rules us, so may we\r\nfoster the hope of witnessing this victory. Are we not in an age that\r\nrushes forward, so to speak, with seven-mile boots, and therefore causes\r\nall the foes of a new and better world to tremble?\r\n\r\nEvery day furnishes fresh proof of the rapid growth and spread of the\r\nideas that we represent. On all fields there is tumult and push. The\r\ndawn of a fair day is drawing nigh with mighty stride. Let us then ever\r\nbattle and strive forward, unconcerned as to \"where\" and \"when\" the\r\nboundary-posts of the new and better day for mankind will be raised. And\r\nif, in the course of this great battle for the emancipation of the human\r\nrace, we should fall, those now in the rear will step forward; we shall\r\nfall with the consciousness of having done our duty as human beings, and\r\nwith the conviction that the goal will be reached, however the powers\r\nhostile to humanity may struggle or strain in resistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n    OURS IS THE WORLD, DESPITE ALL;--THAT IS, FOR THE\r\n                   WORKER AND FOR WOMAN.\r\n\r\n                           FINIS.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[236] [Aside from the contradiction implied between this sentence and\r\nthat other, on page 247, in which the internationally overshadowing\r\neconomic development of the United States is admitted, the forecast,\r\nthough cautiously advanced, that Germany may take the lead in the\r\naccomplishment of the pending Social Revolution, is justified neither by\r\nher economic nor her social development, least of all by her geographic\r\nlocation.\r\n\r\nAs to her economic development, Germany has made rapid and long strides\r\nduring the last twenty years; so rapid and so long that the progress has\r\ncaused the Socialists of Germany, in more instances than one, to\r\nrealize--and to say so--that, what with her own progress, and with\r\noutside circumstances, Germany was distancing England economically. This\r\nis true. But the same reason that argues, and correctly argues, the\r\neconomic scepter off the hands of England places it, not in those of\r\nGermany, but in the hands of the United States.\r\n\r\nAs to her social development, Germany is almost half a revolutionary\r\ncycle behind. Her own bourgeois revolution was but half achieved.\r\nWithout entering upon a long list of specifications, it is enough to\r\nindicate the fact that Germany is still quite extensively feudal in\r\norder to suggest to the mind robust feudal boulders, left untouched by\r\nthe capitalist revolution, and strewing, aye, obstructing the path of\r\nthe Socialist Movement in that country. The social phenomenon has been\r\nseen of an oppressed class skipping an intermediary stage of vassalage,\r\nand entering, at one bound, upon one higher up. It happened, for\r\ninstance, with our negroes here in America. Without first stepping off\r\nat serfdom, they leaped from chattel slavery to wage slavery. What\r\nhappened once may happen again. But in the instance cited and all the\r\nothers that we can call to mind, it happened through outside\r\nintervention. Can Germany perform the same feat alone, unaided? Do\r\nevents point in that direction? Or do they rather point in the direction\r\nthat the work, now being realized there as demanding immediate\r\nattention, and alone possible and practicable, is the completion of the\r\ncapitalist revolution, first of all?\r\n\r\nBut even discounting both these objections--granting that both in point\r\nof economic and of social development Germany were ripe for the\r\nSocialist Revolution--her geographic location prevents her leadership.\r\nNo one single State of the forty-four of the Union, not even the Empire\r\nState of New York, however ripe herself, could lead in the overthrow of\r\ncapitalist rule in America unless the bulk of her sister States were\r\nthemselves up to a certain minimum of ripeness. Contrariwise, any\r\nattempt by even such a State would be promptly smothered. What is true\r\nof any single State of the Union is true of any one country of Europe.\r\nIt is, therefore, true of Germany. Whatever doubt there be as to\r\nGermany's ripeness, there can be none as to the utter unripeness of all\r\nthe other European countries with the single exceptions of France and\r\nBelgium,--and surely none as to Russia, that ominous cloud to the East,\r\nwell styled the modern Macedon to the modern Greek States of the nations\r\nof Western Europe. Though there is no \"District of Columbia\" in Europe,\r\nthe masses would be mobilized from the surrounding hives of the\r\nCimmerian Darkness of feudo-capitalism, and they would be marched\r\nconvergently with as much precision and despatch upon the venturesome\r\nleader. And what is true as to Germany on this head is true of any other\r\nEuropean country. Facts and their relations to one another must be ever\r\nkept in sight. 'Tis the only way to escape illusions--and their train of\r\ntroubles.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, not the sordid competitive spirit of the bourgeois world,\r\nbut that noble and ennobling emulation, cited by the Author in a\r\nquotation from John Stuart Mill, animates the nations of the world that\r\nare now racing towards the overthrow of capitalist domination. Surely\r\nnone will begrudge laurels due that one that shall be the first to scale\r\nthe ramparts of the international burg of capitalism, strike the first\r\nblow, and give the signal for the final emancipation of the human\r\nrace.--THE TRANSLATOR.]\r\n\r\n[237] The number of students at the German universities averaged as\r\nfollows per six months:\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Protestant Catholic\r\n  Quarter.

From that date on the\r\nincrease was by leaps and bounds, until 1886-7; from this date on the\r\nincrease is again slow. From 1871 to 1888-9 the number of students\r\nincreased more than 116 per cent. It is an interesting fact that the\r\nstudy of theology decreased steadily until 1881, but increased thereupon\r\nall the quicker until it reached high-water mark in 1888. The reason was\r\nthat the excess of the supply for all the other posts increased in such\r\nmeasure that it was difficult to secure a place.
