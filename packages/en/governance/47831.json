At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as instructor\r\nof embryo engineers in the economic aspects of their callings; in\r\nservice for the United States Industrial Commission in 1900-01, in\r\ntouch alike with government officials and, travelling all about the\r\ncountry, with shippers and commercial bodies during a period of acute\r\nunrest; and finally ripening the practical experience, thus gained, in\r\nthe favoring atmosphere of Harvard University, seeking to imbue future\r\ncitizens with a sense of their civic responsibilities; through all\r\nthese years, the conviction has steadily grown that, as one of the most\r\nfundamental agents in our American economic affairs, the subjection\r\nof transportation to public control was a primary need of the time.\r\nAn earnest effort has been made to set down the facts concerning this\r\nhighly controversial subject with scientific rigor and with fairness\r\nto all three of the great parties concerned, the owners, the shippers\r\nand the people. If bias there be, it will in all likelihood be found to\r\nfavor the welfare of the \"dim inarticulate multitude,\"--that so inert\r\nmass of interests and aspirations, too indefinitely informed as to\r\ndetails and too much occupied in earning its daily bread, to be able\r\nto analyze its own vital concerns, to give expression to its will,\r\nand even sometimes, as it seems, wisely to choose its spokesmen and\r\nrepresentatives. It is this helpless and unorganized general public,\r\nalways in need of an advocate, which, perhaps, most strongly appeals to\r\nthe academic mind. If there be lack of judicial poise in this regard,\r\nit is, at all events, palliated by free confession in advance.\r\n\r\nNor is the history of the assumption by public authority of its\r\ninherent right to control railroads, as narrow an interest as it at\r\nfirst appears. Transportation, as a service, is the commodity produced\r\nby common carriers. The manner in which the price of this commodity has\r\nbeen brought under governmental regulation has a direct bearing upon\r\nanother problem just beginning to open up; namely that of the control\r\nby the state of the prices of other things. It is not unlikely, in my\r\njudgment, that the final solution of the so-called Trust Problem in\r\nthe United States, whether for good or ill, may ultimately contain as\r\none important feature, the determination by governmental authority of\r\nreasonable prices for such prime necessities of life as milk, ice,\r\ncoal, sugar and oil, when produced under monopolistic conditions. This\r\nview is shared by my colleague Professor Taussig in his \"Principles of\r\nEconomics.\" It is also distinctly set forth by President Van Hise of\r\nthe University of Wisconsin, in his recent \"Concentration and Control.\"\r\nWhen the seed of such an industrial policy is planted, as I believe\r\nit possible in time, the soil will have been richly prepared for its\r\nreception by our experience in the determination of reasonable charges\r\nfor the services of railroads and other public utilities.\r\n\r\nA word of explanation may also be offered to the reader who finds\r\nin these pages an almost exuberant mass of illustrative material.\r\nPossibly, even, it may be alleged that in places so thick are the\r\ncircumstantial trees of evidence that one can scarcely perceive\r\nthe wood of principle. But, under the circumstances, it is almost\r\ninevitable that this should be so. The method of inquiry adopted has\r\nbeen mainly inductive. Text books and theoretical treatises have been\r\nused only by the way. I hold them to be merely of secondary importance.\r\nThe principal reliance has been upon concrete data, painstakingly\r\ngathered through many years from original sources. In this present\r\nexcursion in the far more complex domain of the social sciences, an\r\nendeavor has been made to adhere strictly to the same scientific method\r\npursued in the field of natural science in writing \"The Races of\r\nEurope.\" A search far and wide for every possible bit of raw material\r\nhad to be made at the outset. To this succeeded the classification and\r\nrealignment of the concrete data thus obtained. The last step of all,\r\nwas the formulation of the governing economic principles. But an almost\r\nindispensable result of this mode of work is a plenitude of reference\r\nand example. One might almost say that under such circumstances it\r\nbecomes second nature to demand concrete illustration for every\r\neconomic theory or principle laid down. Such a statement, however,\r\nwould be fallacious. It would misrepresent the true sequence of events\r\nas above outlined. Rather should it be affirmed, that, inasmuch as the\r\nconcrete examples are the sources of the reasoning, no theory can be\r\nheld valid for which somewhere or somehow, positive illustration drawn\r\nfrom practice cannot be found. Such an ideal is, indeed, difficult\r\nto attain; but it may be stated as a cardinal principle to be always\r\nkept in mind. And it ought to excuse an author from the charge of\r\nover-elaboration of detail in illustration. The only crimes for which\r\nno verbal atonement will suffice are that the chosen illustration does\r\nnot fit the principle, or else that the facts have been distorted to\r\nserve a preconceived idea.\r\n\r\nReferences throughout this work to a second volume will be noted. This\r\nwill deal primarily with matters of finance and corporate relations.\r\nThe general subject of railroad combination was necessarily relegated\r\nto another set of covers. This, however, is quite fitting, inasmuch\r\nas the connection between matters of finance and organization is at\r\nall times so intimate and necessary. The development of inter-railway\r\nrelationships has been, perhaps, next to the establishment of\r\ngovernment regulation, the most striking phenomenon of the last decade.\r\nIt is absolutely essential to a comprehension of present day financial\r\nproblems, to understand the nature and extent of the consolidation\r\nof interests which obtains. This second volume, now nearly completed,\r\nwill, it is hoped, appear early in 1913.\r\n\r\nThis volume is also frequently linked by means of cross references\r\nto a set of reprints of notable interstate commerce cases or special\r\narticles which was published some years ago as \"Railway Problems.\"\r\n(Ginn & Co.) Much new material having accumulated since its original\r\nappearance in 1907, it is the intention to prepare a new and revised\r\nedition, particularly designed as an accompaniment to this treatise.\r\nBut the same chapter numbers will be preserved for all material taken\r\nover from the first edition.\r\n\r\nMany friends and specialists, who shall be unnamed, have been of\r\nassistance in various ways for which I am duly grateful. But a few\r\nhave been so peculiarly helpful that it is fitting to make more\r\nparticular mention of my personal obligation. Especially is this true\r\nof Hon. Balthasar H. Meyer of the Interstate Commerce Commission,\r\nfrom whom through many years of friendship and common interest in the\r\nsubject, have come all sorts of aid and suggestion. Prof. F. H. Dixon\r\nof Dartmouth College, Statistician of the Bureau of Railway Economics\r\nat Washington, also a co-worker in the same field, has always without\r\nreserve freely shared the best he had to give. I have drawn liberally\r\nfrom his special contributions on transportation, particularly in\r\nthe history of recent Federal legislation. Despite the difference\r\nin our point of view, the always friendly criticism of Frederic A.\r\nDelano, President of the Wabash Railroad, has been most welcome and\r\nserviceable. In matters of classification, Mr. D. O. Ives, Traffic\r\nExpert of the Boston Chamber of Commerce, has extended a helping hand.\r\nAnd I have profited greatly from the published work of Mr. Samuel O.\r\nDunn, now Editor of the _Railway Age Gazette_. In this connection,\r\nacknowledgment should be made of my deep obligation to the other\r\neditors of that admirable technical journal, who have in series during\r\na number of years afforded me an opportunity of reaching a class of\r\nreaders and, it should be added, not infrequently of unsparing critics,\r\nwhose intelligence and technical knowledge have held me to a strict\r\naccounting in all matters of fact or principle. Without this critical\r\noversight, many statements, happily now tested, would have held less\r\nsecure place. Then again, there is the entire staff of the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission to whom I have been a care and trouble for so many\r\nyears. Ungrudgingly have its members always given response to all sorts\r\nof requests, whether for documents, statistics or opinions. Without the\r\nofficial stores of information at Washington, this present volume would\r\nhave been woefully incomplete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER

area of Europe,--was greatly enhanced at the outset by the\r\ngeographical configuration of the continent of North America. It was\r\nfortunate, indeed, that the original thirteen colonies were strictly\r\nhemmed in along the Atlantic seaboard, thus being protected against\r\npremature expansion. At the same time the north and south direction\r\nof this narrow coastal strip, with its variety of climates, soils,\r\nnatural resources and products, brought about a degree of intercourse\r\nand mutual reliance of the utmost importance. The mere exchange of the\r\ndried fish and rum of New England, for the sugar, tobacco, molasses\r\nand rice of the southern colonies, paved the way for an acquaintance\r\nand intellectual intercourse necessary to the development of national\r\nspirit. Throughout the colonial period, the protected coast waters and\r\nnavigable rivers as far inland as the \"fall line,\" rendered the problem\r\nof long distance transportation relatively easy. For everything went\r\nby water. Population was compelled to develop the country somewhat\r\nintensively, by reason of the difficulty of westward expansion. But\r\nthis population after the Revolution began to press more and more\r\ninsistently against the mountain barriers; so that the need of purely\r\nartificial means of transportation at right angles to the seaboard\r\nbecame ever more apparent.\r\n\r\nThe period from the Revolution down to 1829, when Stephenson's \"Rocket\"\r\nmade its first successful run between Liverpool and Manchester,\r\nattaining a speed of twenty-nine miles per hour, was characterized in\r\nthe United States by increasing interest in canals and toll roads as\r\nmeans of communication. As involving less expenditure of capital, the\r\nhighways were naturally developed first. In 1756 the first regular\r\nstage between New York and Philadelphia covered the distance in three\r\ndays, soon to be followed by the \"Flying Machine,\" which made it in\r\ntwo-thirds of that time. Six days were consumed in the stage trip from\r\nNew York to Boston. But by 1790 a considerable network of toll roads\r\ncovered the northern territory,--systems which, as in Kentucky by 1840,\r\nattained a length of no less than four hundred miles. Post roads linked\r\nup such remote points as St. Louis, New Orleans, Nashville, Charleston,\r\nand Savannah by 1830. Pennsylvania had made an early beginning in 1806;\r\nand by 1822 had subscribed nearly two million dollars to fifty-six\r\nturnpike companies and wellnigh a fifth of that sum toward the\r\nconstruction of highway bridges. Most of these roads throughout the\r\ncountry, however, were private enterprises, and, even where aided by\r\nthe state governments, were imperfectly built and worse maintained,\r\ndisjointed and roundabout.\r\n\r\nThe need of a comprehensive highway system, especially for the\r\nconnection of the coastal belt with the Middle West, early engaged the\r\nattention of Congress. Washington seems to have fully appreciated its\r\nimportance. Ten dollars a ton per hundred miles for cost of haulage by\r\nroad, necessarily imposed a severe restriction upon the extension of\r\nmarkets. The Federal Congress in 1802 appropriated one-twentieth of\r\nthe proceeds from the sale of Ohio lands to the construction of such\r\nhighways. Gallatin's interest in the matter five years later, led to\r\nhis proposal of an expenditure of $20,000,000 for the purpose. The\r\nCumberland Road or \"National Pike\" was the result. This great highway\r\nstarted from near the then centre of population in Maryland and cut\r\nacross the Middle West, half-way between the lakes and the Ohio river.\r\nFrom the upper reaches of the Potomac it followed Braddock's Old Road\r\nto Uniontown, Pennsylvania, then by Wheeling over \"Zanes trace\" to\r\nZanesville, Ohio. From that point on it trended toward St. Louis by\r\nway of Columbus and Indianapolis, ending at Vandalia, Illinois. During\r\nthe space of thirty years about $10,000,000 was expended upon it, and\r\nit undoubtedly did much to promote the settlement of the country. But\r\nthe success of canals and railroads in the meantime sapped the vitality\r\nof the movement for further turnpike construction before St. Louis\r\nwas reached. By the close of the war of 1812, in fact, it had become\r\napparent that highways were destined to serve only as feeders after\r\nall; and not as main stems of communication.\r\n\r\nImproved riverways and canals constituted the next advance in\r\ntransportation method. So far as the latter were concerned, although\r\nthe initial expense was great, the subsequent cost of movement as\r\ncompared with turnpikes was, of course, low. Especially was this\r\ncheapness of movement notable in river traffic. Whereas it was said to\r\ncost one-third of the worth of goods to transport them by land from\r\nPhiladelphia to Kentucky, the cost of carriage from Illinois down to\r\nNew Orleans by water was reputed to equal less than five per cent,\r\nof their value. Hence the steamboat, invented in 1807 and introduced\r\non the Ohio river in 1811, opened up vast possibilities for enlarged\r\nmarkets. But it was not until the generation of sufficient power to\r\nstem the rapid river currents about 1817 that our internal waterways\r\nbecame fully utilized.[2] From that period dates the rapid growth of\r\nPittsburg, Cincinnati, and St. Louis. The real interest of the East\r\nin western trade dates from the close of the war of 1812. Even then,\r\nhowever, the natural outlet for the products of the strip of newly\r\nsettled territory west of the Alleghanies, was still over the mountains\r\nto the Atlantic seaboard. Cotton culture in the South had not yet given\r\nrise to a large demand for food stuffs in the lower Mississippi valley.\r\nIt was a long and wellnigh impossible way around by the Gulf of Mexico.\r\nConsequently the main attention of the people during the canal period\r\nbetween 1816 and 1840 was focussed upon direct means of communication\r\nbetween the coastal plain and the interior. A few minor artificial\r\nwaterways, like the Middlesex canal from Boston to Lowell, completed\r\nabout 1810, proved their entire feasibility from the point of view both\r\nof construction and profit. Even earlier than this the Dismal Swamp\r\ncanal and one along the James river in Virginia had been projected and\r\nin part built. But the era of canal construction as such on a large\r\nscale cannot be said to begin until after the close of the war of 1812.\r\nThe most important enterprise, of course, was the building of the\r\nErie Canal to unite the headwaters of the Hudson river with the Great\r\nLakes at Buffalo. This waterway, began in 1817, was completed in eight\r\nyears and effected a revolution in internal trade. It was not only\r\nsuccessful financially, repaying the entire construction in ten years,\r\nbut it at once rendered New York the dominant seaport on the Atlantic.\r\nPhiladelphia was at once relegated to second place. Agricultural\r\nproducts, formerly floated down the Susquehanna to Baltimore, now went\r\ndirectly over the Hudson river route. Branch canals all over New York\r\nstate served as feeders; and flourishing towns sprang up along the\r\nway, especially at junction points. The cost of transportation per\r\nton from Buffalo to New York, formerly $100, promptly dropped to less\r\nthan one-fourth that sum. By wagon it was said to cost $32 per hundred\r\nmiles for transport, whereas charges by canal fell to one dollar.\r\nLittle wonder that the volume of traffic immensely increased, and\r\nthat, moreover, the balance of power among western centres was at once\r\naffected. The future of Chicago, as against St. Louis, was insured; and\r\nthe long needed outlet to the sea was provided for the agricultural\r\nproducts of the prairie West.\r\n\r\nThe instant and phenomenal success of the Erie Canal immediately\r\nencouraged the prosecution of similar enterprises elsewhere.\r\nPhiladelphia pushed the construction of a complicated chain of horse\r\nrailroads, canals and portages in order to reach the Ohio at Pittsburg.\r\nIn 1834 an entire boat and cargo made the transit successfully. The\r\ncost of this enterprise exceeded $10,000,000; but it was expected to\r\nprovide a successful competitor for the Erie Canal. The latter in\r\nthe meantime had been linked up with the Ohio river by canals from\r\nCleveland to Portsmouth, from Toledo to Cincinnati, and from Beaver\r\non the Ohio, to Erie on the Lake. By the first of these routes in\r\n1835, no less than 86,000 barrels of flour, 28,000 bushels of wheat\r\nand 2,500,000 staves were carried by canal on to New York. Boston and\r\nBaltimore were prevented from engaging in similar canal enterprises\r\nonly by the advent of the railway. Meantime the Chesapeake and Ohio\r\nCanal was started in 1828 as a joint undertaking of Maryland, Virginia,\r\nand the Federal government, to connect the Potomac with the Ohio.\r\nIt was not completed in fact until 1850, long after its potential\r\nusefulness had ceased. Besides these through routes, canals for the\r\naccommodation of local needs were rapidly built in the East. Boston was\r\nconnected with Lowell; Worcester with Providence; New Haven with the\r\nConnecticut river. In Pennsylvania, especially, the anthracite coal\r\nindustry, developing after 1815, encouraged the building of artificial\r\nwaterways. The Delaware and Hudson, the Schuylkill, Morris and Lehigh\r\ncanals were built between 1818 and 1825 along the natural waterways\r\nleading out from the hard coal fields. New Jersey connected New York\r\nand Philadelphia by the Raritan Canal in 1834-1838 at a cost of nearly\r\n$5,000,000; and another canal to connect Delaware and Chesapeake bays\r\nwas with difficulty, and only by the aid of the Federal government,\r\nfinally completed about 1825 at a cost of nearly $4,000,000. Further\r\nsouth, many small canals and river improvements were made. The Dismal\r\nSwamp enterprise had already connected Chesapeake Bay and the coast\r\nwaters and sounds of the Carolinas; but provision for slack water\r\nnavigation of the Tennessee river at Mussel Shoals in Alabama, and of\r\nthe various branches of the Ohio river in Kentucky was not made until\r\nthe middle of the thirties.\r\n\r\nThe open prairies of the West offered the most inviting prospects for\r\ncanal construction, both because of the dearth of roads and the ease\r\nof construction of artificial waterways. Not only through routes to\r\nthe East, as already described, but local enterprises of various sorts\r\nabounded on every side. Chicago was connected with the Mississippi\r\nsystem by way of the Illinois and Michigan Canal; a route across the\r\nlower peninsula of Michigan, and many feeders in Indiana and Ohio\r\nwere built. The demands upon the capital of the country for these\r\npurposes during the twenty years after 1815 were enormous; and it\r\nwas only by resort to state subventions and grants from the Federal\r\ngovernment out of the proceeds of sales of public lands, that so\r\nmuch was actually accomplished. State debts aggregating no less than\r\n$60,000,000 for canal construction were incurred prior to 1837. Much\r\nof this investment proved ultimately unproductive; extravagance and\r\nfraud were rife. But the economic results were immediately apparent and\r\nhighly satisfactory, as witnessed in the higher prices obtainable for\r\nall the products of the interior for transportation to the seaboard.\r\nFlour, which could be had at three dollars a barrel at Cincinnati in\r\n1826, rose to double that figure by 1835; and corn rose from twelve\r\nto thirty-two cents a bushel. The panic of 1837 and the subsequent\r\ndepression, of course, put a severe check upon further canal building.\r\nBut an even more potent force was the proved success of the newly\r\ninvented mode of carriage by railroad. Before 1840 the era of canal\r\nconstruction was definitely at an end. Almost the only exception was\r\nthe Erie Canal, which continued to prosper by reason of its strategic\r\nlocation. Rates were reduced in 1834; and two years later the canal\r\nwas widened and deepened to accommodate the ever increasing traffic.\r\nSurplus revenues enabled the amortization of its debt; and by 1852\r\nthe revenue exceeded three million dollars annually. Although the\r\npressure of railway competition was increasingly felt; as late as 1868,\r\npractically all the grain into New York was brought by canal barge. The\r\nmovement of this canal tonnage, year by year, is shown by the diagram\r\non page 25. As will be seen, it was not until the trunk line rate wars\r\nof 1874-1877 that the inferiority of the canal to the railroad, even\r\nin this favored instance, was finally demonstrated. The revival of\r\ninterest in the Erie Canal which has occurred in recent years, leading\r\nto the expenditure of millions of dollars by the state of New York in\r\nstill further enlarging it, is due to an effort to insure the supremacy\r\nof the port of New York in export trade against the growing competition\r\nof the Gulf ports, which it originally gained when the canal was\r\nconstructed.\r\n\r\nThe first serious attempt at railroad operation in the United States\r\nwas on the Baltimore & Ohio line in 1830. The company, although\r\nchartered in 1821, did not begin construction for seven years. It was\r\nthree years later than this when Peter Cooper's \"Tom Thumb\" made\r\na trial run out from Baltimore with a record of thirteen miles per\r\nhour. A road from Albany to Schenectady was opened in 1831; and a\r\nseries of connecting links was rapidly pushed westward across New York\r\nstate, finally reaching Buffalo in 1842. But prior to 1840, activity\r\nin railroad construction was most noticeable in Pennsylvania: partly\r\nbecause of its lack of so admirable a water route to connect it with\r\ninland markets as was enjoyed by New York, and partly because of the\r\ngrowth of the coal business which caused the main lines of the Reading\r\nRailroad to be laid down as early as 1838. The state of Pennsylvania\r\nwas busily engaged in improving her existing route over the mountains\r\nby replacing the canal and portage portions with rail lines. Pittsburg,\r\nwhich formerly had been five and a half days distant, was thus\r\nconnected by railroad in 1834. Cars built in the form of boat sections\r\nwere to be transferred from the rails to canals along part of this\r\nroute. The Pennsylvania Railroad aiming to provide continuous railway\r\ncommunication over the mountains, was not chartered until 1846; but,\r\nnevertheless, as early as 1835 Pennsylvania had over two hundred miles\r\nof railway, about one-quarter of the mileage of the United States. New\r\nYork and New Jersey had about one hundred miles between them, while\r\nSouth Carolina had one hundred and thirty-seven miles. The Baltimore &\r\nOhio during this time was being slowly pushed westward; although it did\r\nnot reach the Ohio river until 1853, two years after the Erie had, by\r\nliberal state aid, been carried to the lakes at Dunkirk, N.Y. Thus it\r\nappears that during the decade to 1840 railroad building had progressed\r\nunchecked by the panic of 1837. This panic, in fact, by rendering the\r\nstate construction of canals impossible, may actually have increased\r\nthe interest in railroad building. The railways of this time were still\r\nmainly experimental. They were local and disconnected, serving rather\r\nas supplementary to, than as actual competitors of the existing water\r\nroutes. In Massachusetts and Connecticut the lines radiating out from\r\nseaports were intended to serve only as feeders to coastwise traffic;\r\njust as short lines were built along the Great Lakes during the decade\r\nto 1850 to bring products out to a connection with the natural water\r\nroutes. A notable exception was the continuous line which by 1840 was\r\nin operation lengthwise of the Atlantic coast plain from New York\r\nsouth to Wilmington, North Carolina. The Camden and Amboy between\r\nPhiladelphia and New York was operated early in the thirties; about the\r\nsame time that the Philadelphia, Wilmington & Baltimore was completed.\r\nMuch interesting history centres about the first named road. It seems\r\nto have been a notoriously corrupting influence in New Jersey politics\r\nfrom the outset. Public opinion became so roused over its exactions,\r\nthat a memorial from the merchants of New York to the Thirtieth\r\nCongress resulted. The enterprise was the most profitable of all the\r\nearlier companies, its net earnings in 1840 amounting to $427,000. In\r\n1855 it paid a twelve per cent. dividend. From Washington south by way\r\nof Fredericksburg and Richmond, the southern states could be reached\r\nwithout undertaking the perilous passage round Cape Hatteras. By 1840\r\nthe only portions of the original colonies still isolated were New\r\nEngland, at one end, which was still obliged to depend upon Long Island\r\ntransit to New York by boat; and in the Far South, the back country\r\nbehind Charleston and Savannah.\r\n\r\nSeveral important economic causes conspired to stimulate railroad\r\nconstruction at a very early time in the southern states.[3] They\r\nwelcomed the new means of transportation even more eagerly than the\r\nwealthier, commercial and more densely populated North. Ever since the\r\ninvention of the gin in 1793, the production of cotton had grown apace.\r\nProfits were so high that all interest in other forms of agriculture\r\nwaned. Cotton production until about 1817 was mainly confined to the\r\nlong narrow strip of Piedmont territory, lying between the sandy \"pine\r\nbarrens\" along the coast and the mountains in the rear. This fertile\r\nstrip--the seat of the plantation system--thus geographically isolated,\r\nhad only one means of communication with the outer world, namely the\r\ncoast rivers debouching upon the sea at Charleston, Savannah, or, later\r\non, upon the Gulf at Mobile. But these seaports were not conveniently\r\nsituated to serve as local trade centres. They were separated from\r\nthe cotton belt by the intervening pine barrens. The local business\r\nof buying the cotton from the planters, and in return supplying their\r\nimperative needs for supplies of all sorts, including even foodstuffs\r\nwhich they neglected to raise, was concentrated in a series of towns\r\nlocated at the so-called \"fall line\" of the rivers. From Alexandria\r\nand Richmond on the Potomac and James, round by Augusta, Macon, and\r\nColumbia to Montgomery, Alabama, such local centres of importance\r\narose, each one just at the head of navigation. For some years profits\r\nwere so large that heavy charges for transportation to the sea were\r\npatiently borne. But after the opening of the western cotton belt\r\nalong the Mississippi bottom lands after 1817, the price of cotton\r\nexperienced a severe decline, greatly to the distress of the older\r\nplanters. For this reason an insistent demand for improved means of\r\ntransportation had already brought about great interest in turnpike\r\nand canal building. South Carolina at a very early date had expended\r\nabout two million dollars for these purposes. Steamboats on the smaller\r\nrivers were also used. Immediately upon the successful demonstration\r\nof traction by steam the aid of the states, cities and individuals was\r\ninvoked; so that a well planned system of railroads resulted even as\r\nearly as 1843. The South Carolina Railroad between 1829 and 1833 most\r\nsuccessfully operated a pioneer line, its securities being quoted at\r\ntwenty-five per cent. above par. The Charleston & Hamburg line opened\r\nin 1833, one hundred and thirty-seven miles long, was said to be the\r\nlargest system under one management in the world. Augusta & Columbia\r\nwere linked up with the coast. Savannah also penetrated inland to the\r\nPiedmont belt by a line finished in 1843 as far as Macon. The interest\r\nin a through route to connect Cincinnati and Louisville with Charleston\r\nwas very keen; and had it not been for the tremendous fall in cotton\r\nprices in 1839-1840, the project might have succeeded. As it was, a\r\ngreat railroad convention at Knoxville in 1836 was attended by no\r\nless than four hundred delegates from nine different states. It was\r\nnot so much the mileage of these roads which rendered them notable,\r\nas the fact of their intended reliance upon through freight instead\r\nof passenger business. Roads in other parts of the country were as\r\nyet depending in the main upon passenger traffic or upon the carriage\r\nof what we would now call local or parcel freight. These southern\r\nlines were built to accommodate traffic in great staple agricultural\r\nproducts--cotton out and foodstuffs in. Unlike the northern roads,\r\nalso, they early adopted a uniform gauge and sought to promote long\r\ndistance business. Later developments in the South especially in the\r\ndirection of improved service were very slow. The northern states\r\nspeedily outstripped them; but the enterprise of this region in\r\nrailroad building and operation at the outset has not been fully\r\nappreciated.\r\n\r\nThe decade 1840-1850 was marked by slow growth of the railway\r\nnet,--everywhere except in New England, where the main lines were\r\nbeing rapidly laid down. The doom of the canal as a competitor had\r\nbeen sealed, to be sure; but the dearth of private capital, except in\r\nNew England, rendered progress slow until aid from the government was\r\ninvoked. Until this time private enterprise had been the main reliance.\r\nSeveral important undertakings were now launched. The Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad was chartered in 1846, but was not completed to Pittsburg\r\ntill 1852. The Boston & Albany line was built; and Buffalo had been\r\nreached. But neither the Baltimore & Ohio, nor the Erie had yet been\r\npushed to completion. The possibilities of the great Northwest had\r\nnot dawned upon the people. At the opening of the decade, St. Louis\r\nwas still almost three times as large as Chicago. Cincinnati was the\r\nmost important western centre, its prestige being enhanced by the\r\nfirst all-rail line to the Great Lakes at Sandusky, opened in 1848.\r\nThe relative importance of these inland centres is indicated by their\r\npopulations. In 1850 these were as follows: Cincinnati, 115,000;\r\nChicago, 30,000; St. Louis, 78,000; and Louisville, 43,000. Cincinnati\r\nretained its preëminence until after the Civil War; but by 1880 had\r\ndropped to a low third in rank, only half the size of Chicago and\r\ntwo-thirds the size of St. Louis.[4] During the decade to 1850, the Ann\r\nArbor line from Detroit also was pushed on to Chicago in 1852, to cut\r\noff the roundabout trip by lake;[5] but St. Louis was still isolated;\r\nIndianapolis was barely connected with the Ohio river. The river trade\r\nthus still dominated the western situation. In the South one important\r\nenterprise monopolized all attention, namely the construction by the\r\nstate of Georgia of the Western & Atlantic road over the mountains from\r\nAtlanta to Chattanooga on the Tennessee river.[6] Atlanta was to become\r\nthe western terminus of the coast roads, built, as has been said, to\r\nprovide an outlet to the sea for the Piedmont cotton belt. This new\r\nenterprise was to open up a direct route, not alone to the new western\r\nSouth but to the entire Northwest by connecting with a navigable branch\r\nof the Ohio. It is an odd fact that at this time the southern ports\r\nwere nearer the West than the cities of the North Atlantic. Part of the\r\nfirst rush of the Forty-niners to California was by way of Charleston\r\nand thence west over the Charleston & Hamburg line. From 1837 on, the\r\nWestern & Atlantic line was under construction. In the meantime Atlanta\r\nhad been reached from the east; so that at the beginning of the next\r\ndecade, two at least of the main arteries of the southern net were\r\nready for business.\r\n\r\nThe total mileage of the United States expanded in ten years after\r\n1840 from 2,800 to upwards of 9,000 miles of line. For some time not\r\nover four or five hundred miles annually had been constructed; but\r\nsuddenly the new mileage laid down in 1848 jumped to more than fourteen\r\nhundred miles. This was a presage of the great expansion to occur in\r\nthe next few years,--an expansion made possible partly as a result of\r\nimportant mechanical improvements and inventions. Notable among these\r\nwas the substitution of the solid iron rail for the primitive method\r\nof plating beams with thin strips of iron. The manufacture of rails in\r\nthe United States, begun in 1844, did much to stimulate the subsequent\r\ngrowth. The repeal of the law of 1832 permitting free entry of railway\r\niron which took place in 1843, marks the beginning of a new era. During\r\nthese eleven years almost five million dollars in duties on rails was\r\nrefunded.\r\n\r\nThe utmost activity in railroad building obtained from 1848 until\r\nthe panic of 1857, interrupted only by a minor disturbance in 1854.\r\nThe total mileage expanded more than threefold, attaining a total of\r\n30,000 miles by 1860. A veritable construction mania prevailed in the\r\nstates of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. Not very much, relatively,\r\nwas accomplished in New York and Pennsylvania, and very little in\r\nNew England, which was already well served. A dominant influence in\r\npromoting the new construction at this time was the imperative need\r\nof the South for foodstuffs. Cotton culture was in full swing in the\r\nlowlands of Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. An enormous steam and\r\nflat boat tonnage on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers had grown up to\r\ncare for this trade.[7] By 1845 the river shipping amounted to nearly\r\ntwo million tons. Fifteen hundred out of four thousand steamboat\r\narrivals at New Orleans in 1859, came from the Ohio river and the\r\nupper Mississippi. The vessels had also greatly increased in size. The\r\nflat boats which in 1820 carried only thirty tons of freight, were\r\nenlarged tenfold in tonnage and threefold in length by 1855, and in\r\nthat year first began to be towed back up the river. A rapid increase\r\nin coal shipments down stream from Pittsburg also took place during\r\nthe forties. From 737,000 bushels in 1844, to 22,000,000 bushels in\r\n1855 and 37,900,000 in 1860, represents an enormous development of\r\ninternal commerce. The lead mines of Missouri shipping through St.\r\nLouis had become important after 1832 and quadrupled in volume by\r\n1848, attaining a total of 42,400,000 pigs of sixty pounds each. This\r\ntraffic steadily dwindled, however, falling away by one half within the\r\nnext ten years. Memphis was rapidly growing, outstripping the city of\r\nNatchez which had formerly played a more important part in the southern\r\ntrade. But the most important element in this Mississippi river\r\nbusiness was the shipment down stream of food stuffs. Produce received\r\nat New Orleans was valued at $26,000,000 in 1830, $50,000,000 in 1841,\r\nand $185,000,000 in 1860. About thirty per cent. of this consisted\r\nof farm produce from the Northwest, together with horses, mules,\r\nimplements, and clothing. The need of ampler transportation facilities\r\nto accommodate all this business was apparent. A response came in plans\r\nfor new north and south lines of railway. The difficulty of financing\r\nthese enterprises was solved in part by the expedient of land grants\r\nby the different states. These amounted to no less than eight million\r\nacres under President Fillmore, attaining a total of nineteen million\r\nacres under the Pierce administration. By 1861 these grants, mainly\r\nin aid of railroads, had reached a total of no less than 31,600,842\r\nacres,--more than equal to the area of either of the states of Ohio, or\r\nNew York.[8] The Illinois Central grant in 1851 was the largest among\r\nthese. Congress in 1850 had made over a tract of 2,700,000 acres to\r\nthe state of Illinois to be used for this purpose. This gift was soon\r\nfollowed elsewhere by grants to aid the building of the Mobile & Ohio\r\nand the Mississippi Central, together with smaller roads in Alabama\r\nand Florida. The Gulf of Mexico was thus reached by through lines from\r\nthe west in 1858-1861. In other parts of the country railroads were\r\npushed well out in advance of population. The Mississippi was reached\r\nby the Rock Island system in 1854, quickly followed by the Alton, the\r\nBurlington and the predecessor of the present Northwestern system.\r\nThe Hannibal & St. Joseph was the first to reach the Missouri river\r\nin 1858. There is no doubt that the discovery of gold in California\r\ngreatly stimulated interest in all these far western enterprises.\r\n\r\nDespite this remarkable record of growth, a corresponding development\r\nof long-distance communication between different parts of the country\r\nhad not yet taken place. While the all-rail routes were open, they\r\nstill consisted in large part of disconnected local lines. The New\r\nYork Central with difficulty in 1853, and in spite of intense local\r\nopposition, succeeded in effecting a consolidation of what were\r\noriginally eleven separate lines; but the union with the Hudson River\r\nRailroad was not to follow until 1869. The Boston & Albany was still a\r\nlocal enterprise, although built with larger ends in view. At this time\r\nthe possibility of long-distance carriage of grain was only very dimly\r\nappreciated. Fast freight lines to operate without breaking bulk over\r\nindependent roads, constituted the first step in this direction. Such\r\ncompanies on the New York Central in 1855 and on the Erie two years\r\nlater, were operating in the eastern trunk territory. The so-called\r\nGreen lines were engaging in long distance business by way of Ohio\r\nriver connections between the territory to the northwest and the great\r\ngrain and pork consuming cotton belt. But railroad traffic as a whole\r\nwas still relatively unimportant as compared with water carriage. The\r\nculmination of steadily increasing receipts on the Erie Canal did not\r\noccur until 1856. River tonnage went on steadily increasing for another\r\ntwenty years. The years just before the war seem to have marked the\r\nturning point in respect of canal competition; but the total volume\r\nof railroad shipments, nevertheless, still appears insignificant by\r\ncomparison with the present day. The total traffic in 1859 on the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad was only 353,000 tons east bound and 190,700 tons\r\nwest bound; while on the New York Central it was 570,900 and 263,400\r\ntons, respectively. The important point was that the cost of shipment\r\nwas steadily declining. According to H. C. Carey, the passenger rate\r\nfrom Chicago to New York had fallen from about seventy-five dollars to\r\nseventeen dollars in 1850; while the freight rate per bushel on wheat\r\nhad fallen to twenty-seven cents; and per barrel of flour to eighty\r\ncents. Nothing but the development of a large surplus production in the\r\nWest was needed to create a great traffic; and this was dependent upon\r\nthe spread of population and improvements in agricultural production\r\nwhich had not yet occurred. Transportation as yet waited upon the\r\nprogress of invention; not in instruments of transportation alone, but\r\nin all the other fields of industrial endeavor.\r\n\r\nThe panic of 1857 and the increasing bitterness of the slavery\r\nquestion, followed by the outbreak of the Civil War, quite diverted\r\nthe attention of the country from internal development. Railroad\r\nconstruction had already declined from 3,600 miles in 1856 to 1,837\r\nmiles in 1860. It fell to less than 700 miles in 1861. Brisk recovery\r\nset in after 1865; but it was not until 1868 that any rapid growth\r\nagain ensued, or even a resumption of the activity of the preceding\r\ndecade. All of the southern lines were prostrated; the north and south\r\nroads, like the Illinois Central system, stood still. The western\r\nrailway net alone was slowly expanding. The Burlington grew from 168\r\nmiles in 1861 to over 400 miles in 1865; and the Chicago & Northwestern\r\nthen succeeded in bridging the Mississippi. The Erie was still a more\r\nimportant route by fifty per cent., measured by ton mileage, than the\r\nNew York Central; although its evil days, under the control of Jim\r\nFiske and Jay Gould in 1866-1869, were about to begin. The Mecca of\r\ntrade from the Atlantic ports was still St. Louis, although Chicago\r\noutgrew it during the decade. The predominant direction of trade is\r\nshown by the widespread public interest in New York in the newly opened\r\nWestern & Atlantic railroad, which by a spur from the Erie road at\r\nSalamanca, was to shorten the time of shipment of goods from New York\r\nto Cincinnati from one month to a week. The commercial star of New York\r\nwas steadily rising. A great aid thereto was, of course, the progress\r\nof consolidation among the connecting links to Chicago. Vanderbilt and\r\nScott were busily engaged in this constructive work. The former had\r\nshifted his interest from steamboats to railroads, and became dominant\r\nin the Harlem and Hudson River roads in 1863-1864. Three years later\r\nhe secured control of the New York Central from Albany west, and\r\nconsolidated it with the Hudson River line. These trunk line roads, the\r\nPennsylvania and the New York Central, both finally secured connections\r\nwith Chicago in 1869. A channel for new through currents of trade\r\nmerely awaited the growth of business.\r\n\r\nIt is important to realize the relative primitiveness of transportation\r\nat the close of the Civil War.[9] The Bessemer steel process was not\r\nperfected until the latter half of the decade.[9] Iron rails still\r\nrendered light rolling stock necessary. But after 1868 the price of\r\nsteel rails rapidly declined, from about $166 (currency) per ton in\r\n1867 to $112 in 1872, and to $59 in 1876.[10] This doubtless gave a\r\ntremendous impetus to the developments of later years, although its\r\neffects were not evident for some time. One of the most troublesome\r\nfeatures of the time were the differences of gauge which rendered\r\nthrough traffic difficult. In New York and New England, the standard\r\ngauge was four feet eight and one-half inches. West and south of\r\nPhiladelphia it was four feet ten inches. In the Far South it was\r\nfive feet; and in Canada and Maine, either five feet six inches or six\r\nfeet. Between Chicago and Buffalo five different roads still had no\r\ncommon gauge. Clumsy expedients of shifting car trucks, three rails\r\nor extra wide wheel flanges were adopted. Even as late as 1876 Albert\r\nFink refers to the celerity with which trucks could be changed at\r\njunction points, not over ten minutes being requisite.[11] The first\r\ndouble tracking in the country, that of the New York Central, was not\r\naccomplished until the war period. There was not even a bridge over the\r\nHudson at Albany until 1866, and no bridge at St. Louis, although the\r\nNorthwestern had bridged the Mississippi higher up. No night trains\r\nwere run generally. No export grain trade existed, although feeble\r\nbeginnings had been apparent at New York for some years. Philadelphia\r\ndid not even have a trunk line as late as the end of the war; and\r\nneither Boston nor Philadelphia had regular steamer lines to Europe.\r\nFor the great staples of trade, the canals and rivers were largely\r\nutilized. The Erie Canal during the war, took twice as much freight as\r\nthe Erie and New York Central together. Even in 1865 the ton mileage of\r\nthe Erie Canal--844,000,000--compared with a ton mileage of 265,000,000\r\nfor the New York Central and 388,000,000 for the Erie Railroad. And\r\nin 1872, eighty-five per cent of the freight between New York and\r\nPhiladelphia still went by water.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRailroad construction during the next decade to 1880 was extremely\r\nactive. East of the Mississippi developments were confined in the main\r\nto building branches and feeders. One new through line in the East\r\nwas opened, by the entrance of the Baltimore & Ohio into New York\r\nin 1873 and into Chicago in the following year. Another important\r\nenterprise was the building of the Air Line route to connect Atlanta\r\nwith Richmond by a road traversing the fertile Piedmont belt. The\r\ncompletion by the state of Massachusetts of the Hoosac Tunnel line,\r\nproviding a new outlet to the west from Boston, was also a notable\r\nachievement. This route was at last opened in 1874 after a painful\r\nexperience extending over twenty years, involving an expenditure by\r\nthe state of about $17,000,000. Most of the new railroad building of\r\nthe seventies took place in the upper Mississippi valley. The states\r\nof Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, (eastern) Nebraska and Kansas were\r\nrapidly gridironed with new lines. Much of this construction took\r\nplace after 1868, activity culminating in 1871 with the building of\r\nno less than 7,379 miles of line. The panic of 1873 put an end to all\r\nthis, except in California where expansion went on unabated. Nearly\r\none thousand miles of new line were added to the systems of this state\r\nduring the five years to 1878,--nearly doubling its mileage during this\r\nperiod. Elsewhere in the country little was accomplished during the\r\nprotracted hard times. In 1875, for instance, only seventeen hundred\r\nmiles were constructed. This cessation of development did not change\r\nfor the better until the resumption of general prosperity in 1878.\r\nThe net result of ten years building was, nevertheless, considerable,\r\nrepresented by an expansion from 53,000 to upwards of 93,000 miles of\r\nline. Railroad building, in fact, increased about two and one-half\r\ntimes as fast as population. So that by 1880 the United States was\r\nalready more amply furnished with transportation mileage than any\r\ncountry in Europe.\r\n\r\nAmong the important events to be associated with this period was the\r\nopening of the first transcontinental route, marked by the joining of\r\nthe Union and Central Pacific railroads in 1869. The history of its\r\nconstruction under liberal land grants from the Federal government\r\nbelongs in another place. Aside from the political effect, the economic\r\nresults were immediate. Population at once flowed over onto the Pacific\r\nslope. And a large volume of trade was at once deflected from the sea\r\nroute round Cape Horn. The value of goods shipped by water between New\r\nYork and San Francisco, which in 1869 amounted to $70,000,000, fell\r\nin the next year to $18,600,000, and in 1872 to less than $10,000,000.\r\nThe success of the enterprise, together with growing interest in the\r\nPacific states, doubtless led to the opening of construction of the\r\nNorthern Pacific as a transcontinental route in 1870.\r\n\r\nThe rapid development of an export trade in grain to Europe between\r\n1870 and 1874 was a direct result of improvements in agriculture and\r\nthe opening up of a surplus grain-producing area. As yet this territory\r\nlay mainly east and south of Chicago. Even as late as 1882, over\r\nfour-fifths of the eastbound trunk line traffic originated not further\r\nwest than Illinois. Wisconsin and Iowa contributed less than ten per\r\ncent. of this business. The methods of handling wheat were still quite\r\nprimitive. During the Civil War thousands of men were employed to\r\nunload the grain by hand, every tenth barrel being weighed. Elevators\r\nhad been used in Chicago for some time but no eastern city had them\r\nuntil 1861. Prior to 1872, when the first grain elevator was set up at\r\nBaltimore, the cost of thus unloading grain by hand amounted to four or\r\nfive cents per bushel. At Boston until 1867, all the export grain was\r\nstill unloaded back of the city and hauled across to the waterfront.\r\n\r\nThe volume of exportable surplus products of the country rose rapidly\r\nafter 1870. An increase from five or six bushels of wheat production\r\n_per capita_ in 1860, to nearly nine bushels in 1879, left a large\r\nmargin for foreign sale. The growth of such traffic, big with\r\nimportance for the carriers, is indicated by the opposite diagram.\r\nThe large total of 59,000,000 bushels of wheat and (equivalent) wheat\r\nflour reached in 1862, partly as a result of the closing of markets in\r\nthe southern states, was not again surpassed for more than a decade.\r\nThe most notable increase ensued after 1873, when the level rose about\r\nfifty per cent., to become established thereafter upon a permanently\r\nhigher plane. A second sudden boost occurred again in 1877 when wheat\r\nexports rose rapidly to a total of 180,000,000 bushels within three\r\nyears. The disastrous failure of European crops in 1879, with a\r\ncoincident bumper yield in the United States, led to the immediate\r\nclimax of the movement in 1881. These exports, moreover, which fifty\r\nyears earlier, owing to the cost of carriage, were almost exclusively\r\nin the form of flour, were now in 1880 about three-fourths constituted\r\nof raw wheat. Examination of the diagram with its steep pyramid of\r\ndevelopment at this time is convincing as to the stimulus thereby given\r\nto the railway interests. Foreign trade in cattle and beef products\r\nalso enormously increased during these years. In 1876 only 244 steers\r\nwere exported, while in 1877, 71,794, and in 1881, 134,000 head were\r\nshipped abroad. The value of preserved meats exported quadrupled in\r\none year after 1877, and grew eightfold by 1880. Doubtless part of\r\nthis disposition of products abroad during the seventies was due to\r\na cessation of demand at home owing to the prevalent hard times; but\r\nthe important discovery was incidentally made that the demand abroad\r\nexisted, and merely required cheap transportation for its successful\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXPORTS OF DOMESTIC WHEAT AND FLOUR]\r\n\r\nThe second step necessary for permanently developing railroad business\r\nwas a lowering of the charges. This was first brought about during\r\nthe seventies through unregulated competition between the trunk\r\nlines. The fiercest warfare occurred during the years immediately\r\nfollowing the entrance of the Baltimore and Ohio and the Grand Trunk\r\nrailroads into Chicago in 1874. This was some five years after the\r\nPennsylvania and the New York Central had consolidated their through\r\nlines to the same point. These two original rivals had already slashed\r\nrates indiscriminately. Charges of $1.88 and 82 cents for first-and\r\nfourth-class freight from Chicago to New York in 1868, had already\r\nfor a brief period in the following year dropped to a uniform rate\r\nof twenty-five cents for all business. As Hadley justly observes,\r\nsuch rates could not long prevail; and for the next few years nominal\r\nrates of one dollar, and one dollar and fifty cents for first class,\r\nand sixty and eighty cents for fourth class obtained. The outbreak\r\nof open warfare between the Baltimore & Ohio and the Pennsylvania\r\nover the charges made by the latter for the use of its lines between\r\nPhiladelphia and New York, occurred in 1874. Grain rates of sixty cents\r\nper hundred pounds from Chicago to New York during 1873 fell to forty\r\ncents in 1874 and to thirty cents in 1875. Special or commodity rates\r\nwere often as low as twelve cents. After a year's truce, only partially\r\nobserved by the leading participants, discord again prevailed during\r\n1876. The commercial rivalries of seaboard cities now became involved.\r\nDifferent or specially favorable rates had been accorded to Baltimore\r\nand Philadelphia as compared with New York since 1869.[12] Rates\r\nfinally fell lower than ever before. This was especially true of grain.\r\nThe published rate in March, 1876, was forty-five cents per hundred\r\npounds from Chicago to New York. In May it fell to twenty cents--a rate\r\nalmost as low as prevails today with all modern improvements in methods\r\nof conducting the business. Westbound rates dropped correspondingly.\r\nQuotations from New York to Chicago at twenty-five cents per hundred\r\npounds first class, and sixteen cents fourth class were freely given.\r\nActual rates were often much lower than this.\r\n\r\nRival cities again intervened and finally the whole matter was of\r\nnecessity referred for arbitration to a commission. Even then both the\r\nErie and the Baltimore & Ohio roads were well advanced on the road to\r\nbankruptcy. For us, however, the immediate result of importance was a\r\npermanent reduction of the general level of freight rates, not alone\r\nfor the trunk line territory but for the entire country. The diagram\r\non page 413 shows this plainly. From an average revenue per ton of\r\nfreight moved one mile of 1.92 cents in 1868, intermittently upheld\r\nuntil 1872, the fall of over one-third to about 1.1 cents in 1882 was\r\nsudden and continuous. The end was not yet. The renewed outbreak of\r\na rate war between the trunk lines in 1881 and again in 1884 led to\r\nfurther reductions. The decision in 1882 of the Thurman Commission on\r\nDifferentials settled nothing.[13] All kinds of traffic were affected.\r\nImmigrants were carried from New York to Chicago for $1.00 a head.\r\nEast-bound grain rates were as low as eight cents. At last, late in\r\n1885, the warfare was terminated by an elaborate pooling agreement.\r\nThese struggles brought about great reductions in the revenue of the\r\ncarriers concerned; but declines in rates after this period were, in\r\nthe main, more gradual, with short intervals of relief interspersed.\r\n\r\nOne immediate result of these lower freight rates was the impetus\r\ngiven to economy and systematic operation. This is the period when, as\r\nwe have said, pooling as a device for restraint of competition first\r\nappeared in the \"Evening\" contracts on beef shipments in the West, in\r\nthe notable Southern Railway & Steamship Association in 1874 and in\r\nthe trunk line pool in 1877. Agreement between the anthracite coal\r\nroads began about 1872 and has continued with increasing effectiveness\r\never since.[14] This was also the heyday of the through freight lines\r\nwhich were now operating from every important western centre. In 1876\r\nthe first attempt at a systematic scheme of rate adjustment between\r\ncompeting localities was made in trunk line territory.[15] Order\r\nwas indeed emerging out of chaos. In respect of operation, larger\r\nlocomotives and cars and longer trains were rapidly coming into use.\r\nOn the Lake Shore the average train load in 1870 was 137 tons. Nine\r\nyears later it had risen to 213 tons. The widespread substitution of\r\nsteel for iron rails was not yet to follow for some time. For in 1880\r\nonly three-tenths of the mileage of the country was laid with steel.\r\nThis proportion rose to eight-tenths in 1890. It was doubtless this\r\nchange during the eighties which made possible the heavy decrease in\r\noperating expenses which occurred during the five years subsequent to\r\n1881. It appears, indeed, as if the need of economy was enforced by the\r\ndecline of rates in progress; but, as usual, the supply of economies\r\nwaited upon the demand and, in fact, tarried well behind it. To this\r\ncircumstance may be attributed some of the financial hardships suffered\r\nby the roads during the ensuing interval between the reduction of rates\r\nduring the seventies and the mechanical improvements of the succeeding\r\ndecade. An incidental result of the rate wars of this period, it may\r\nalso be noted, was the readjustment of the relative shares of the great\r\nseaports in foreign business. Philadelphia, especially, increased its\r\nquota of exports from about eleven per cent, in 1860 to over twenty\r\nper cent. in 1880. Much of this was gained, however, from the southern\r\nports, as the relative status of Baltimore, New York, and Boston\r\nremained about the same.\r\n\r\nA second important consequence of the severe decline in railroad rates\r\nduring the seventies, was the permanent supersession of canals and\r\nriverways in favor of railroads as means of transportation. The Erie\r\nCanal outlasted all the other artificial water routes, most of which\r\nhad succumbed to rail competition by the close of the Civil War. But\r\neven as late as 1868, practically all of the grain arriving at New York\r\ncame by canal. The change, when it occurred, came suddenly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FREIGHT RECEIPTS AT NEW YORK]\r\n\r\nNo canal could meet the fierce slashing of rates which suddenly\r\nsupervened on the rail lines. Since 1855, when the canal carried\r\ntwice the traffic of all the trunk lines, until 1861-1862 when the\r\nrail and water lines were about even, the railroads had steadily\r\ngained in tonnage.[16] The turning point was reached in 1872 when the\r\ncanal traffic actually began to decline. Between 1871 and 1876 the\r\naggregate tonnage (both ways) on the New York canals fell away about\r\nhalf, spasmodically recovered during the great expansion of exports\r\nin 1879-1880, held constant for five years, and thereafter steadily\r\ndwindled away. As the accompanying diagram shows, the rise of railroad\r\ntonnage was rapid up to 1873. Thereafter for several years during the\r\nactual panic, despite the railroad wars and low rates, no great change\r\noccurred. But by 1876, eighty-three per cent. of all-grain receipts at\r\nAtlantic ports came by rail; and over nine-tenths of all the commerce\r\nbetween East and West had left the water routes. At New York the three\r\nmain railroads carried six times the traffic of all the state canals\r\nin 1880. After that time the canal barges were loaded only with coal,\r\nlime, sand, cement, and similar low-grade traffic. So that in the rapid\r\nexpansion of business, which, as our diagram shows, occurred after\r\n1878, the canal shared not at all. The disparity between east-and\r\nwestbound tonnage was notably great. In 1870 this eastbound traffic was\r\nabout three times as great as the tonnage west bound. In 1881 it was\r\nseven and one-half times as great, declining thereafter to a proportion\r\nof about 6.5 to 1 during the late nineties. This inequality, of course,\r\nwhetted the appetite of the carriers for back loads to fill the\r\nwestbound trains, and undoubtedly gave an impetus to rate disturbance.\r\nThe rate wars led by the New York Central during 1881 were largely due\r\nto this fact.\r\n\r\nAs for water carriage elsewhere, the rivers soon followed the canals in\r\nsteady decline of relative importance. On the southern streams, such as\r\nthe Cumberland and Tennessee, the principal diversion to the railroads\r\nof traffic in foodstuffs south bound from the West, took place in the\r\nfive years subsequent to 1866.[17] High-water mark in the Mississippi\r\ntrade was reached in 1879, the year of the completion of the jetties\r\nfor the improvement of navigation at the mouth of the river. A steady\r\ndecline thereafter has ensued down to the present day. New Orleans had\r\nthen only recently engaged in foreign trade in grain. Exports of wheat\r\nand flour (equivalent) had suddenly risen from less than 1,000,000\r\nbushels in 1875 to over 12,000,000 bushels in 1880. At this time this\r\ncame principally by river. It was nearly ten years later before the\r\nIllinois Central actively engaged in such export business. But when\r\nthe railroads finally seized upon it, the river trade was doomed.\r\nThe only exception to this decrease of inland water transportation\r\noccurred on the Great Lakes. The carriage of coal, iron ore, and lumber\r\nrapidly increased. Through the Detroit river, the tonnage grew from\r\n9,000,000 in 1873 to 20,000,000 tons in 1880; and through the St.\r\nMary's Canal from 403,000 in 1860 to 1,734,000 tons in 1880. Inasmuch\r\nas a fair proportion of this rapidly growing business was ultimately\r\ndestined to reach the seaboard either as raw material or in the form of\r\nmanufactures, this water traffic contributed to, rather than lessened\r\nthe prosperity of the trunk lines operating east of the lakes.\r\n\r\nThe growing importance of railroads during the seventies was\r\naccompanied by collateral developments, which deserve mention in a\r\ngeneral preliminary survey. The abuses of personal discrimination\r\nand favoritism, constantly recurring rate wars and disturbances,\r\nthe financial scandals of construction companies and subsidiary\r\ncorporations, the frauds perpetrated by unscrupulous financiers like\r\nGould and Fiske, coupled with the arrogance of railroad managements,\r\naroused widespread public hostility. This led to an insistent demand\r\nfor public regulation and control. The Granger movement formed its\r\nopen expression in the western states. The searching inquiries of\r\nthe famous Hepburn Committee of the New York legislature in 1879\r\nvoiced it in the East. The Windom report of 1874 was called forth on\r\nbehalf of the Federal government. The first railroad commission, that\r\nof Massachusetts in 1869, was soon followed by others all over the\r\ncountry. And a campaign of education was set under way which finally\r\nled to the Federal inquiries of the Cullom Committee of 1886 and the\r\nFederal Act to Regulate Commerce of the following year.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe decade of the eighties, so far as common carriers are concerned,\r\nwas primarily characterized by new railroad construction. Over 70,000\r\nmiles of line were built in ten years,--a mileage just about equal\r\nto the total new construction for both the ten preceding and the ten\r\nfollowing years combined. The movement culminated in 1882, and again in\r\n1887, in two veritable crazes of promotion and speculative activity,\r\nunequalled before or since in our railroad history. The first was\r\nsuddenly stopped by a short, sharp railroad panic in 1884. Jay Gould's\r\noperations in Union and Kansas Pacific set a pace for manipulation and\r\nfraud, which could have no other sequel. The second craze was doubtless\r\nin part restrained by the moral effect of the passage in 1887 of the\r\nAct to Regulate Commerce; although, viewed in a larger way, it was more\r\ndirectly due to the exhaustion both of the supply of capital and of\r\nconfidence among investors. These two outbreaks of railroad promotion\r\nare deserving of further comment, both by reason of their extent and\r\ncharacter. Prior to 1880, new railroads constructed had averaged a\r\nlittle over two thousand miles annually. The figures for 1881-1882,\r\nrespectively, were 6,711 and 9,846 miles, rising finally to a total of\r\n11,569 miles in 1882. This record has never been surpassed but once:\r\nwhen, four years later at the height of the second \"boom,\" 12,983 miles\r\nof new line were laid down. A large part of this building was in the\r\nFar West and Southwest, these regions being now opened up as the upper\r\nMississippi valley had been developed between 1868 and the panic of\r\n1873. A second transcontinental route was opened in 1881, through the\r\njoining of the Southern Pacific and Atchison Topeka and Santa Fe roads\r\nat Deming and El Paso. Within two years thereafter two direct routes to\r\nconnect the Southern Pacific system with New Orleans were completed.\r\nThe Pacific Northwest was admitted to rail connection with the rest\r\nof the country in 1883-1884, by two significant events. The Northern\r\nPacific road was then opened, and the Oregon Short line to connect the\r\nColumbia river basin with the Union Pacific system. The Great Northern\r\nroad reached the Pacific slope in the year 1893, accompanied by the\r\nCanadian Pacific, constructed just over the border. This activity in\r\nfar western railroad building was mainly due to the growth of the\r\nPacific slope; but it was also favored by the successful competition of\r\nrailways with the water routes round Cape Horn. It was estimated that\r\nas late as 1878, not over one quarter of the total tonnage moved into\r\nCalifornia went by rail. But the railroads then inaugurated a system\r\nof special contracts by which shippers who agreed to use the railroads\r\nexclusively, were given considerably reduced rates. By 1884 when the\r\nplan was discontinued, the percentage of tonnage carried to California\r\nby rail rose from twenty-five to between sixty and seventy-five\r\npercent. In the eastern states, the eighties was the period of\r\nspeculative \"parallelling\" of existing lines of road, in order to\r\ndragoon the older lines into purchasing the new ones at extortionate\r\nprices. This was done under the guise of affording satisfaction to\r\nthe popular outcry for competition as a means of reducing rates. Two\r\nnotable instances were the building of the West Shore road, paralleling\r\nthe New York Central; and of the Nickel Plate line which similarly\r\nran for miles within a few rods of the Lake Shore across northern\r\nOhio. The fact was that the prolonged period of depression during the\r\nseventies had brought about an accumulation of surplus capital awaiting\r\ninvestment. The rapid repayment of its debt by the United States\r\ngovernment, also released a large supply of funds. General prosperity\r\nprevailed and prices were everywhere rising. This increase of prices,\r\nextending from commodities to all issues of stocks and bonds, reduced\r\nthe rate of return upon investment for these new supplies of capital\r\nin all the older enterprises. The only alternative, in seeking for\r\na liberal return on investments, was to risk it in new ventures.\r\nSpeculation ran riot. All sorts of projects were eagerly taken up, and\r\namong these, new railroads were most important. They were freely built,\r\nfar in advance of population in the West or of prospective needs for\r\nenlargement in the East, not so much sometimes to develop the country,\r\nas to enrich the promoters. That they ultimately served the public\r\ninterest was not the main concern in too many instances. This was also\r\nthe heyday of the fraudulent construction company, already so ably\r\nutilized by the builders of the Pacific roads.[18]\r\n\r\nIn short, speculation in every conceivable form ran riot in a way not\r\nrepeated thereafter for nearly twenty years.\r\n\r\nAside from rampant speculation, American railroad history during the\r\neighties must record various other economic events of importance.\r\nThe city of New York and the New York Central Railroad were at the\r\nculmination of their relative importance in the export trade of the\r\ncountry. The volume of eastbound tonnage was enormous in the early\r\neighties. In 1881, 2,500,000 tons of freight east bound were carried\r\nby the New York Central alone, a figure surpassed in only two years\r\nuntil 1896. Another event of importance was the general westward drift\r\nof population and agriculture. This was accompanied by a corresponding\r\nmigration of manufactures inland from the Atlantic seaboard. The lines\r\nfrom the Central West to the South, such as the Illinois Central and\r\nthe Cincinnati, New Orleans & Texas Pacific road, had formerly relied\r\nalmost entirely upon the carriage of grain or flour and packing-house\r\nproducts from the farms of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois to the\r\ncotton-raising South. During the latter half of the eighties they\r\ncarried an ever increasing proportion of manufactured goods, such as\r\nboots and shoes, clothing, wooden ware, harnesses and groceries,--in\r\nfact everything denoted by the words general merchandise. More and more\r\nthe supplies of grain, flour and packing-house products were being\r\nproduced in Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas, while larger quantities of\r\ngeneral merchandise originated in the Middle West. The result was a\r\nneed for new diagonal trunk lines from such points as Kansas City and\r\nOmaha into the lower Mississippi valley. The decline of Cincinnati as a\r\ngreat pork-packing centre dates from this time. Memphis and Vicksburg\r\nderived a new importance at the junction of such lines as the Kansas\r\nCity, Memphis & Birmingham with the older Mississippi river roads. At\r\nabout this time, in 1889, also, occurred the opening of the Gulf ports\r\nfor the export of the surplus grain products of the territory west of\r\nthe Mississippi. The significance of this for the eastern trunk lines\r\ndid not appear until later; but the occurrence forms a part of that\r\nwestward trend of population above mentioned. These years were all\r\ncharacterized by the increasing importance of long-distance through\r\nbusiness, as distinguished from mere local trade. The markets of the\r\ncountry as a whole, the areas of commercial competition, were steadily\r\nexpanding. Viewed in a large way, it was doubtless this economic\r\nphenomenon which at this time emphasized the need of centralized\r\nFederal control, instead of state regulation, if control there were\r\nto be. This found its expression in the passage by Congress of the\r\nInterstate Commerce Act of 1887.\r\n\r\nA phenomenon of national importance was the rapid expansion of export\r\ntrade in staple commodities, through New Orleans, Galveston and\r\nother Gulf ports. This began in 1889 when the Illinois Central first\r\nengaged in export business in grain. It soon assumed considerable\r\nproportions, with the growth of population and agriculture in the\r\nsouthwestern part of the United States; and, with the completion of\r\nthe Panama Canal in 1913, will doubtless be even more notable in\r\nfuture. The opening of new railway connections with these Gulf ports\r\nabout 1896 led to still further expansion of this trade. An immediate\r\nresult was of course a decline in the relative importance of the great\r\nAtlantic seaports, particularly New York. A growing appreciation of\r\nthis fact is accountable for the great interest in New York state in\r\nprojects for enlarging the Erie Canal. A few figures, together with\r\nthe diagram on the next page, illustrate the situation. A generation\r\nago about nine-tenths of our exports of wheat and about seven-tenths\r\nof our exports of flour, went out through the port of New York. In\r\n1899 less than one-half of our wheat and less than one-third of our\r\nflour was exported through the same city. The larger part of this loss\r\nensued after 1896, with the opening of new lines to the Gulf ports as\r\nabove mentioned. The New York Commerce Commission in its report for\r\n1900 found that for 1899, while the nation's total foreign shipments\r\nof wheat was larger than at any time since 1892, New York actually\r\nexported twenty million bushels less than seven years earlier. Exports\r\nin 1900 were the smallest in her history, forming, that is to say,\r\nthe lowest proportion of the total exports of the United States. They\r\nwere actually about a million bushels of wheat less than went out\r\nthrough the two principal Gulf ports. An indirect result of this growth\r\nof New Orleans and Galveston was an intense competition between all\r\nthe Atlantic trunk lines interested in the eastern seaports and the\r\nrailroads tributary to the Gulf of Mexico. The part of the country\r\nmost affected by this competition, of course, was that portion about\r\nequidistant from the two sea coasts. This rivalry led to rate wars on\r\na scale not witnessed before since the trunk line struggles during\r\nthe seventies. St. Louis, Kansas City and all the region thereabouts,\r\nenjoyed the benefit of ruinously low rates as a consequence,--an\r\nadvantage not accorded to other parts of the country. One cannot doubt\r\nthat this factor was most influential in encouraging the growth of\r\ntheir population and trade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXPORT OF WHEAT BY SEAPORTS MILLION BUSHELS]\r\n\r\nThe development of the Gulf ports more recently, together with the\r\nsituation respecting rate wars on export grain, is still further\r\nindicated by the chart. When New Orleans in 1891 considerably increased\r\nits business through the activities of the Illinois Central Railroad,\r\nit speedily developed that climatic conditions led to saturation of\r\nthe grain with moisture in the vessels' holds. This fact, together\r\nwith other difficulties, discouraged progress. But, for a time, with\r\nthe revival of foreign commerce in 1897, both the Gulf and Atlantic\r\nports shared in the greatly increased business. Galveston had now come\r\ninto the field; and at times surpassed New Orleans in importance by\r\nvirtue of the development of wheat fields in the Southwest. But the\r\noverweening ambition of these Gulf ports, threatening as they did\r\nthe supremacy of New York, led to intense rivalry. All the lines to\r\nthe Gulf became finally pitted against all the trunk lines serving\r\nthe Atlantic seaboard. The advantage for two or three years seemed\r\nto lie with the southern lines; and, as the chart indicates, in\r\n1903-1904 grain exports through New Orleans and Galveston actually\r\nexceeded those of any other ports. After the utter collapse of export\r\nbusiness in 1905, trouble once more threatened to break out; but it\r\nwas fortunately averted by a compromise effected in 1906. The Gulf\r\nlines on through freight demanded a substantial differential to\r\noffset certain disabilities, such as the longer haul, poorer service\r\nand climatic damage to which they were exposed. The trunk lines\r\nsuccessfully met this contention in part, and finally brought about\r\na peaceful settlement of the difficulty. Under this arrangement of a\r\nsmall differential in favor of the Gulf, New York, as the chart shows,\r\nhas once more resumed its preëminence as compared with the rest of the\r\ncountry. But of late the ever-lessening volume of surplus American\r\ngrain for export to Europe[19] has rendered the question of far less\r\nimportance than at one time it threatened to assume.\r\n\r\nThe rapid growth and development of the Canadian railroads and ports\r\nhas also been notable in recent years. The Grand Trunk Railway was a\r\nfactor in Chicago business from the very first; and had to be reckoned\r\nwith in all trunk line rate adjustments. The dressed beef rate war\r\nof 1887 proved this fact. But a new era of Canadian competition was\r\ninaugurated with the opening by the Canadian Pacific of the so-called\r\n\"Soo\" route in 1890, across the straits of Mackinac, thus opening a\r\nshort line from St. Paul and Minneapolis to the East. Persistent rate\r\nwars during the next few years, particularly 1892-1893, finally led\r\nto recognition of the claims of this lien by the trunk lines. Much\r\nbusiness was undoubtedly diverted from Chicago. Between 1884 and 1891\r\nthe flour shipped from Minneapolis increased over fifty per cent., yet\r\nthe proportion going by way of Chicago largely declined. Much of this\r\nbusiness, of course, ultimately reaches the seaboard by the combined\r\nLake and rail routes; but a large part goes out through Canada during\r\nthe open season. Yet, on the other hand, it is equally true that the\r\nwonderful development of the Canadian Northwest since 1905, contributes\r\nin many ways to the prosperity of American carriers and seaports.\r\n\r\nAs for new railroad construction since 1890, as shown by the\r\nstatistical chart on page 78, it has been proportionately much slower\r\nthan during the eighties. From about five thousand miles laid down\r\nin 1890, a drop ensued to less than two thousand miles in each of\r\nthe four years of depression after 1893. And the former rate was not\r\nresumed until 1901, since which time construction has ranged about\r\nsix thousand miles annually. This slackened rate of growth during the\r\nlast fifteen years is an indication of a fact of great importance. The\r\ncountry as a whole with almost 250,000 miles of line in 1911 seems to\r\nbe fairly well supplied with transportation routes. It seems as if\r\nthe main trunk lines and systems had now been provided, leaving for\r\nthe future the problem of constructing branches and feeders and of\r\nincreasing facilities upon the main lines already built by duplication\r\nof tracks and enlargement of terminals. A comparison of the rates of\r\ngrowth of mileage and traffic, or of density of traffic, shows how new\r\nconstruction is lagging behind the development of business. Present\r\nconditions may best be shown by a few figures. The total mileage of\r\nthe United States is nearly equal to a ten track railroad completely\r\nencircling the globe. The United States had already in 1900 about\r\nforty per cent. of the aggregate mileage of the world, considerably\r\nexceeding the total mileage of all the countries of Europe combined.\r\nThe situation may be illustrated in another way, by reference to\r\nthe relation of mileage to population and area. Europe in 1902 had\r\nabout 7.4 kilometres of line to every 10,000 inhabitants, as compared\r\nwith 41.4 kilometres (twenty-six miles) for the United States. This\r\nshows that proportionately to population the United States is about\r\nsix times as well equipped with railroads as Europe. Similar results\r\nappear with reference to superficial area. As compared with Europe\r\nalone, we have about two-thirds as much mileage to every square mile\r\nof territory, despite the fact that our density of population is only\r\nabout one-seventh of that of Austria Hungary--one of the most sparsely\r\npopulated countries in Europe. These figures show conclusively that\r\nour railroad problems for the future will be mainly concerned with\r\naccommodating the huge volume of existing traffic along the routes\r\nalready built, rather than in seeking to develop new ones to parallel\r\nthe old.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeveral essential peculiarities of American railroad development stand\r\nout in sharp relief by comparison with the experience of Europe. The\r\nmost significant, perhaps, is the large amount of public participation\r\nin construction, evinced through liberal grants of aid in lands, credit\r\nand cash by both the state and Federal governments. The huge aggregate\r\nof these state subventions is not generally appreciated. Because our\r\nrailroads are now private concerns, so far at least as legal title\r\nis concerned, it is too often assumed in public discussion that they\r\nowe their existence solely to private initiative and enterprise. With\r\nall credit to their sturdy builders, to whose vision and courage so\r\nmuch is due, the plain historical fact remains that the people of the\r\nUnited States have had a large share in the great task of creating our\r\npresent railway net,--not indirectly alone, through settlement of the\r\nvirgin territory, but immediately and directly through land grants and\r\nsubventions.[20]\r\n\r\nThe total of land grants by state and Federal governments in aid of\r\nrailroads, according to the most careful estimates, is approximately,\r\n155,000,000 acres,--that is to say, about 242,000 square miles. The\r\nUnited States alone is believed to have given about 26,000,000 acres or\r\n40,000 square miles. For purposes of comparison, the following table of\r\npresent-day areas is useful.\r\n\r\n  German Empire          208,000 sq. miles\r\n  France                 204,000 sq. miles\r\n  Texas                  265,000 sq. miles\r\n  New England States      66,000 sq. miles\r\n  Illinois                56,000 sq. miles\r\n  Belgium                 11,000 sq. miles\r\n  Massachusetts            8,300 sq. miles\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that a gift of territory greater by about one-fifth\r\nthan the entire area either of the German Empire or France, almost\r\nequal in size to the state of Texas or four times the New England\r\nstates, has, at one time or another, been made in aid of railroad\r\nconstruction. The Federal grants equal about two-thirds of the area\r\nof the New England states, or, in other words, are about five times\r\nthe size of the state of Massachusetts. A large proportion of the\r\narea of the newer commonwealths was offered as a bonus to railroads.\r\nSeven western states--including, for example, Minnesota, Iowa, and\r\nWisconsin--gave away from a fifth to a quarter of their birthrights.\r\nNebraska donated one-seventh, and California one-eighth. The Lone Star\r\nstate discovered in 1882 that in her youthful ardor she had given\r\naway some 8,000,000 acres more than she possessed.[21] Shall it ever\r\nbe said, in the face of such evidence, that these common carriers are\r\nprivate concerns, to be administered solely in the interest of holders\r\nof their securities?\r\n\r\nAs concerns aid in the form of funds or credit, that is to say, through\r\nsubscription to railroad stocks or bonds, it is hazardous to venture\r\nstatistics, particularly for the separate states and municipalities.\r\nBut the statement[22] of direct appropriations and subscriptions to\r\nsecurities on the next page is as reliable as any. The amount of\r\nmunicipal and local aid can only be a matter of guess work, even\r\nnominally, to say nothing of its real cash value. Including everything\r\nfrom the heavy investments of such cities as Baltimore ($3,500,000) or\r\nCincinnati ($10,000,000) down to those of little places like Watertown,\r\nWisconsin,[23] with its railroad debt of $750,000 on a population of\r\n7,553 souls ($100 _per capita_), the total for local aid as above\r\nstated seems conservative enough. For Massachusetts alone no fewer than\r\n171 town and city bond issues for railroad construction were authorized\r\nin the forty years to 1871. The municipalities in Wisconsin by 1874,\r\ndespite its later settlement, issued about seven million dollars in\r\nbonds for similar purposes. As long as the state legislatures were\r\nfree to appropriate moneys, they did so with a lavish hand; but when,\r\nas in Illinois in 1848, they were constitutionally prohibited from\r\ndoing so, the enthusiasm shifted to the lesser governmental units.\r\nForty-three counties in Nebraska, between 1869 and 1892, voted subsidy\r\nbonds to railroads to the amount of $4,918,000. In the case of towns\r\nand cities, also, it was possible to play off one against another. No\r\nambitious community could stand idly by and see a new railroad go to a\r\nrival place. There was no option but to vote bonds. And farmers, as in\r\nIllinois, who had no cash, simply mortgaged their farms. It is clear\r\nthat in the aggregate these local contributions greatly exceeded in\r\namount those of the state and National governments.\r\n\r\n                     _Amounts granted to railroads_\r\n\r\n  Alabama                        $15,800,000\r\n  Arkansas                        $7,100,000\r\n  Delaware                          $600,000\r\n  Florida                         $4,000,000\r\n  Georgia                         $4,000,000\r\n  Illinois                       $12,000,000\r\n  Indiana                         $1,800,000\r\n  Kentucky                          $200,000\r\n  Louisiana                       $7,700,000\r\n  Maryland                        $6,800,000\r\n  Massachusetts                  $41,000,000\r\n  Michigan                        $3,200,000\r\n  Minnesota                       $2,200,000\r\n  Missouri                       $31,700,000\r\n  New York                        $5,400,000\r\n  North Carolina                 $11,400,000\r\n  Ohio                              $500,000\r\n  Pennsylvania.                  $12,700,000\r\n  South Carolina                  $5,700,000\r\n  Tennessee                      $34,100,000\r\n  Texas                           $4,800,000\r\n  Virginia                       $15,400,000\r\n                                ------------\r\n      Total  (approximately)    $228,500,000\r\n  United States:\r\n      Bonds                      $64,600,000\r\n      Interest to 1887          $114,000,000\r\n                                ------------\r\n                                $400,000,000\r\n  Municipal and local           $300,000,000\r\n                                ------------\r\n                                $700,000,000\r\n\r\nA true estimate of the proportions of this public aid recognizes, of\r\ncourse, that many of these grants possessed only a nominal value.\r\nThe eighty-mile line in Texas, cited by Potts as the recipient of\r\n588,000 acres of land, was glad enough to dispose of them for sixteen\r\ncents an acre. Stickney mentions a Minnesota half-breed member of the\r\nlegislature who took ten dollars in cash for his vote on a railroad\r\nbond subsidy, rather than $100,000 in capital stock. But, on the other\r\nhand, if the land or bonds had little value, the roads themselves\r\nwere actually laid down at a very low cost. It was the proportion of\r\npublic aid to total real investment which was significant. Wisconsin\r\nto 1874 had officially subsidized its roads to the amount of over\r\n$21,000,000, including lands at three dollars per acre. This sum was\r\nsufficient to have met one-half the legitimate cost of construction of\r\nthe properties then existent. Reliable evidence[24] tends to show that\r\nthe state and National governments, up to 1870, had pledged themselves\r\none way or another for a sum equivalent to one-fifth of the cost of\r\nconstruction of the 47,000 miles of line then in the United States.\r\nAnd approximately another fifth, at the very least, must have been\r\ncontributed from local and municipal sources.\r\n\r\nIn point of time, public aid by the states was quite unevenly\r\ndistributed.[25] Massachusetts and Maryland, about 1826, were the\r\nfirst to take notice. But in the northern states most of the activity\r\nwas confined to the period of 1837-1840; whereas, in the South,\r\ngovernmental subsidies did not become frequent until 1850. The whole\r\nmovement, so far as the separate states were concerned, came to an end\r\nabout 1870; after which time, with the exception of Massachusetts and\r\nTexas, little more financial encouragement of the sort is recorded. In\r\nmany instances the hands of legislators were tied by constitutional\r\nprohibitions; and in other cases the railway net had been so far\r\ncompleted as to lessen the zeal of the public in the work. The centre\r\nof interest after the Civil War, in fact, is to be found in the\r\nactivities of the Federal government.\r\n\r\nMore than a broad-line sketch of the land grants and subsidies to\r\nrailroads by the United States would be out of proportion.[26] Sporadic\r\ngrants in the South were made directly as early as 1835; but the first\r\nconsiderable transfer was made by act of Congress in 1850. This statute\r\nceded to the state of Illinois the alternate, even-numbered sections\r\nof land for six sections in width on each side of the projected\r\nIllinois Central Railroad and its branches. The state then promptly\r\nturned over these lands to the promoters of the line. The Federal\r\ngovernment lost nothing by the transaction. Rather did it gain,--the\r\nlands having been long in the market,--through the sale of the odd\r\nsections at a more than doubled price. Similar extensions of this grant\r\nsoon followed down through Alabama and Mississippi. Then other states\r\ndemanded recognition. Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Louisiana, Wisconsin\r\nand Minnesota were in turn appeased. The last direct grant to a state\r\nwas made to Michigan in 1872. With the rise of interest in the Far\r\nWest, the Federal government during the Civil War period inaugurated a\r\nnew policy of direct charter and subsidy. Under this plan most of the\r\ntranscontinental lines were built.\r\n\r\nThe Union Pacific Railroad was the most notable beneficiary of the\r\nFederal government. Its experience may be offered as typical. By\r\nan act of 1864, twenty alternate sections of land per mile were\r\ngranted, together with a subscription to junior bonds to the amount\r\nof $27,600,000. With this substantial encouragement the road was soon\r\ncompleted. The following table gives details concerning the succeeding\r\ngrants to other companies.[27]\r\n\r\n                       _Federal Aid to Railroads_\r\n\r\n                              Bonds     Lands ($1.25 per acre.)\r\n\r\n  Union Pacific            $27,200,000         $14,100,000\r\n  Kansas Pacific            $6,300,000          $7,500,000\r\n  Central Branch (U.P.)     $1,600,000            $278,000\r\n  Sioux City and Pacific    $1,620,000             $54,000\r\n  Central Pacific          $25,800,000         $10,000,000\r\n  Western Pacific           $1,970,000            $567,000\r\n                           -----------         -----------\r\n                           $64,623,000 (about) $32,536,000\r\n\r\nThe primary investment of the United States in this pioneer road was\r\nthus considerable. Despite elaborate sinking-fund provisions, the\r\ncombination of speculation, fraud and mismanagement in its affairs,\r\nrendered even the payment of current interest charges impossible.\r\nMatters went from bad to worse, especially after 1883 when several\r\nnew competitive routes were opened--the Southern and Northern Pacific\r\nroads, the Atchison and the Burlington. Bankruptcy ensued in 1893, a\r\nstate of affairs which, as it soon appeared, could not be bettered\r\nuntil provision should be made for settlement of the government's\r\nclaim.[28] Various proposals for partial payment proved unsuccessful.\r\nUntil at last, in 1897, under threat of foreclosure proceedings, the\r\nbanking interests in charge of reorganization agreed to a settlement\r\nin full--$27,200,000 principal and $31,200,000 interest. The outcome a\r\nyear later on the Kansas Pacific, was less fortunate. The United States\r\nreceived payment of the principal of its lien, $6,300,000; but was\r\nobliged to forego the interest, amounting to about as much more. Then,\r\nin turn, in 1899, the Central Pacific claim, amounting to $27,855,000\r\nprincipal and $30,957,000 interest was disposed of by being refunded\r\nin notes payable semi-annually over a period of ten years. Thus, with\r\nunexpected ease and despatch, was the direct interest of the United\r\nStates in railroad affairs brought to a brilliant conclusion.\r\n\r\nA striking characteristic of American transportation history,\r\nemphasized by the foregoing account of land grants and subsidies,\r\nis its essentially speculative character. Railroads were more often\r\nconstructed in advance of population and settlement than to accommodate\r\ntraffic already in existence. Speculation, as will appear in another\r\nvolume, has permeated all of our railroad finance. In the early days\r\nthe most extravagant visions of development were indulged in on all\r\nsides. In the words of a Wisconsin legislative committee in 1854\r\nprotesting against the passage of further laws for the encouragement of\r\nrailroad construction: \"In imagination every acre of land from Walker's\r\nPoint to Snake Hollow has been plowed, sowed, fenced, and is bearing\r\nforty bushels of wheat.--Such estimates are quite delusive.--It takes\r\nmoney to make railroads. It takes money to make the mare go; much\r\nmore the iron horse.\" True indeed, then and now! But a review of our\r\ntransportation history makes it plain that without this national note\r\nof optimism and adventure, the vast capital creation in railroads of\r\nthe present time could never have been called into being. Public aid\r\nand private enterprise and sagacity were alike needed to accomplish the\r\ngreat work in hand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe dominating events in our later economic history, so far as\r\nrailroads are concerned, have been the period of severe distress and\r\nprostration following the panic of 1893; a subsequent revival of\r\nprosperity, with unprecedented demands for transportation during the\r\nten years thereafter until 1907; and a movement toward consolidation\r\nof the railroad net into great territorial systems, notably during\r\nthe two years after 1898, as a result of which competition was\r\npractically eliminated from all railroad business. The long decline in\r\nfreight rates was succeeded after 1900 by a steady rise of charges;\r\nthe phenomenal prosperity and consolidations led to wild speculative\r\noutbreaks on the stock exchanges, especially in 1901 and 1906; and the\r\nspread of industrial consolidation enormously emphasized the evils and\r\nabuses of personal discrimination and favoritism. As a result of these\r\ninfluences there arose in turn, after 1900, an irresistible demand\r\nfor greater governmental supervision, both of rates and of finance.\r\nTaken all in all, these later years have witnessed both a public and\r\nprivate interest in railroads, greater perhaps than at any earlier\r\nperiod of our history. But these later events, aside from being set in\r\ntheir proper relation to the whole in this preliminary general survey,\r\nrequire detailed analysis each one by itself. Where not considered\r\nwithin these covers, they will be treated in a second volume dealing\r\nprimarily with matters of finance and corporate organization.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  NOTE\r\n\r\n    No attempt at an exhaustive historical account is herein\r\n    attempted.

The examination of earnings is not feasible\r\nuntil a later time. For neither a railroad nor a factory can earn money\r\nuntil it has first liberally expended it. A physical plant must be\r\nprovided, in the first place, which means the guarantee of interest on\r\na large capital; and, secondly, it must often be operated unprofitably\r\nat the outset. This is especially true in a new and undeveloped\r\ncountry like the United States; where demand for transportation must\r\nbe frequently created by the invasion of virgin territory, making it\r\ninviting for settlement. Twenty years ago such an analysis of railroad\r\nexpenditures with any approach to precision, owing to the absence of\r\nscientific data, would have been impossible. A few companies, such as\r\nthe Pennsylvania, the Union Pacific and the Louisville & Nashville,\r\nhad indeed attempted to systematize their accounts; but there was\r\nno agreement as to details, despite a certain harmony in questions\r\nof principle. But since the passage of the Act to Regulate Commerce\r\nin 1887, and largely owing to the work of Prof. Henry C. Adams as\r\nstatistician to the Interstate Commerce Commission, the matter may now\r\nbe examined profitably in detail. The data is published annually in\r\na volume entitled \"Statistics of Railways in the United States.\" The\r\namplified powers of the Interstate Commerce Commission since 1906 have\r\nconsiderably changed the system in force since the original law of\r\n1887; but the general principles remain unchanged.[29] One feature of\r\nthe new law, however, is important. Not only must detailed reports be\r\nperiodically and promptly made; but no company is now permitted to keep\r\nits books in any other form than the one officially prescribed. This\r\nstandard was adopted after extended conference with the Association\r\nof American Railway Accounting Officers, which body has, in fact,\r\nofficially approved of the form adopted in most regards. These\r\naccounts, therefore, may be said to represent the combined intelligence\r\nof the practical and theoretical analysts, of the operating and\r\nfinancial staffs, and of the governmental supervisory board. A great\r\nimpetus to scientific railroad economics has undoubtedly resulted from\r\nthis coöperation between government officials and private managements.\r\n\r\nThe primary distinction in railroad expenses is between those which\r\nare constant and independent of the volume of traffic, and those which\r\nvary more or less directly in proportion to it. Thus, of the total\r\noutlay, it may at once be premised that for a time, at least, certain\r\ncapital expenditures are entirely unrelated to the volume of business\r\ntransported. Interest on bonded indebtedness is neither increased nor\r\ndiminished, up to a certain point, by the number of tons of freight\r\nmoved; whereas, on the other hand, other items of expenditure, such as\r\nwages of train hands and fuel cost, are more or less directly affected.\r\nThe distinction above mentioned finds its clearest expression in\r\nthe primary division of railroad accounts into so-called \"operating\r\nexpenses,\" which are variable; and \"fixed charges,\" which, as the name\r\nimplies, are constant. Much of the direct wear and tear of equipment\r\nbelongs to the first class, while, as we have said, interest on its\r\nown funded or floating debt, together with capital obligations on\r\nleased lines, naturally fall into the second group. This second class\r\nof constant expenses, which along with taxes is often denominated\r\nin railway reports \"Deductions from Income,\" is a relatively large\r\none. Thus, in 1910, out of a total expenditure by all the operating\r\nrailroads of the United States of $1,822,000,000, no less than\r\n$490,000,000, or about 27 per cent., consisted of interest on debt and\r\ntaxes. This proportion of absolutely fixed expenditures, moreover,\r\nshows a remarkable constancy throughout a series of years. It reached\r\nhigh-water mark during the hard times in 1895, at 33.07 per cent. of\r\nall outlay. Indebtedness had accumulated unduly, while at the same\r\ntime the volume of traffic was so small that mere operating expenses\r\ndwindled in proportion. But since that time, largely as a result of the\r\nfinancial reorganizations of 1893-1897, the percentage of fixed charges\r\nhas reached its present low point. This improvement is also in part due\r\nto the growth of traffic, and thereby of operating expenses. The latter\r\nhave indeed grown faster than the accumulation of debt, owing to the\r\npractice prevalent among American roads of paying for many improvements\r\nand additions out of surplus income, rather than by charging them to\r\ncapital account,--that is to say, by borrowing money to pay for them.\r\n\r\nHaving at the outset deducted approximately one-quarter of our total\r\nexpenditures to meet fixed charges, we may now proceed to analyze\r\nthose outlays which remain. And this is to be done, always keeping in\r\nmind the fundamental distinction between constant and variable items.\r\nFrom 1887 until 1906 the operating expenses of American railroads were\r\nallocated in the four following groups:\r\n\r\n  (1) Maintenance of Way and Structures\r\n  (2) Maintenance of Equipment\r\n  (3) Conducting Transportation\r\n  (4) General Expenses\r\n\r\nThis grouping under the new law of 1906 has been somewhat\r\nredistributed. But inasmuch as most of the statistical data as yet\r\navailable is presented under the above-named heads, we shall adhere to\r\nthat classification. This we may the more properly do, as our object\r\nis to show the general bearing of railroad expenditures upon rate\r\nmaking, rather than specifically to analyze cost accounts. For this\r\nsimple purpose the above arrangement is entirely adequate.\r\n\r\nThe general nature of each of these above named groups is roughly\r\nexpressed by its title. Under the first, Maintenance of Way, are\r\nsegregated those outlays which have to do with the up-keep of the\r\nroadway and permanent structures in proper shape for the moving of\r\ntrains. It includes, besides such obvious items as ballast, rails, ties\r\nand the wages of track men, every outlay on permanent structures, such\r\nas bridges and tunnels, stations, grain elevators, stock pens, gas, oil\r\nand water tanks, and even scrap bins and eating houses. To these are\r\nadded scores of other minor items, such as maintenance of telegraph\r\nlines, fences and cattle guards, signal plants and docks and wharves.\r\nEvery kind of tool or appliance used, and all wages paid in connection\r\nwith the maintenance of this part of the property are included.\r\nInsurance and even the legal costs and damages incurred in connection\r\nwith accidents, are all assigned to the appropriate property. The\r\nsecond group, Maintenance of Equipment expenses, includes, as the name\r\nimplies, the proper care and preservation of all the rolling stock\r\nin good working order. Repairs and renewals of all locomotives, cars\r\nand vessels, form the largest single items. But all shop machinery\r\nand power plants are included, with specification in detail of every\r\nappliance needed in connection with the work, as, for example, over\r\none hundred and fifty possible items from \"adze handles, ammonia and\r\nauger bits\" down to \"wire brushes, wrenches and zincs.\" Conducting\r\nTransportation expenses, the third group, are supposed to provide for\r\nthe actual movement of traffic. The two former classes of expenditure\r\nhaving put the fixed plant and rolling stock in condition, it remains\r\nto operate the property. Under this head is chargeable all costs of\r\ncoal and supplies, wages of train hands from enginemen to car porters,\r\nyard, station, switch and signalmen and telegraph operators. To these\r\nare added such items as \"purchased power,\" \"cleaning cars,\" \"clearing\r\nwrecks,\" and \"losses and damages\"; in short, every conceivable item of\r\nexpenditure which can be assigned to the service as distinct from the\r\nmere property.\r\n\r\nA fourth group of expenditures remains, denominated General Expenses.\r\nThis includes all salaries of principal administrative officers from\r\nthe president or receiver down to the real estate and tax agents,\r\ntogether with all their allowances for expenses, special cars or trains\r\nand the like. All clerical salaries in the general offices naturally\r\nbelong here, as well as most of the legal expenses, outlay for\r\npensions, relief departments and the like.\r\n\r\nA distinct improvement in the matter of principle has been made in\r\nthe revised classification of operating expenses under the new law\r\nof 1906, by the segregation of a fifth group, denominated Traffic\r\nExpenses.[30] These cover all the work of soliciting business, making\r\nrates and accounting for freight and passenger traffic. Such outlays\r\nwere formerly grouped in the main under conducting transportation,\r\nbut, as is quite evident, they are distinct in their nature from the\r\nexpenses incidental to the actual handling of trains. Administrative\r\nrailroad organization has long recognized the peculiar and important\r\nnature of this work by constituting it a separate department,\r\nusually headed by one of the vice-presidents of the road. The main\r\nitems under this special head are salaries and expenses of a large\r\nstaff of officers and clerks, such as general passenger and freight\r\nmanagers, agents and travelling solicitors; rents and care of offices\r\nat home or abroad; advertising, membership in traffic associations,\r\nimmigration and industrial bureaus, expenses for experimental farms,\r\nfield demonstrators, donations to expositions, fairs and stock\r\nshows--everything, in brief, which tends to create or keep business,\r\nto be afterward actually handled by the transportation departments. In\r\nfuture the detailed official statistics will segregate these expenses;\r\nbut at the present writing and in statistics down to 1906 they must be\r\nbulked in with conducting transportation. An important modification\r\nin accounting under the new law of 1906 has also been made in respect\r\nto depreciation charges. Heretofore the practice of companies varied\r\nwidely, as will hereafter be shown. Under the new rulings a definite\r\nand uniform system of charging off for depreciation has to be provided,\r\nthe details of which, however, need not concern us at this time.[31]\r\n\r\nThe following table based upon the returns for 1905 shows the relative\r\nimportance of the principal items under railroad expenditures grouped\r\nunder the proper headings:\r\n\r\n  ======================================================================\r\n                                     | Per cent. of | Per cent. of\r\n                                     | operating    |    total\r\n                                     | expenses     | expenditures\r\n  -----------------------------------+--------------+-------------------\r\n  Maintenance of way and structures  |        19.78 |     14.39\r\n    Repairs of roadway               | 10.39        |      --\r\n    Renewals of rails                |  1.3         |      --\r\n    Renewals of ties                 |  2.66        |      --\r\n    Repairs, etc., of bridges, etc.  |  2.32        |      --\r\n    Repairs, etc., of buildings, etc.|  2.11        |      --\r\n  Maintenance of equipment           |        20.76 |     15.09\r\n    Repairs & renewals of locomotives|  8.29        |      --\r\n    Repairs & renewals passenger cars|  1.97        |      --\r\n    Repairs & renewals freight cars  |  8.20        |      --\r\n  Conducting transportation          |        55.49 |     40.36\r\n    Engine and roundhouse men        |  9.4         |      --\r\n    Fuel for locomotives             | 11.28        |      --\r\n    Train service (wages)            |  6.54        |      --\r\n    Switchmen, flagmen, etc.         |  4.34        |      --\r\n    Station service                  |  6.44        |      --\r\n  General expenses                   |         3.96 |      2.90\r\n                                     |--------------|\r\n        Total operating expenses     |       100    |\r\n        Fixed charges                |              |     27.23\r\n                                     |              |    ------\r\n        Total--all expenditures      |              |    100\r\n  ======================================================================\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISPOSITION OF REVENUES AND INCOME FOR THE FISCAL YEAR\r\nENDING JUNE 30, 1909.

In the third or right-hand column,\r\nit will be observed, the main groups are again given in percentages,\r\nnot of the operating expenses alone, but of the total outgo, including\r\ncapital expenditures in the nature of fixed charges. It should also\r\nbe noted, of course, that only a few of the large or more important\r\nitems are here included, and in the right-hand column no details, other\r\nthan for the four main headings, have been computed. The constancy\r\nin the distribution of these groups of railroad expenditures over\r\na term of years is graphically shown by the opposite diagrams.[32]\r\nThe perpendicular line for each year is divided proportionately to\r\nthe relative importance of each designated item of expense for that\r\nyear. Thus the course of the horizontal lines, dividing the four\r\nmain percentage zones, represents the ups and downs in the relative\r\nimportance of each item. Occasionally, as in the years following 1895,\r\nthe proportion of so-called general expenses decreased appreciably;\r\nbut, in the main, all the items moved more or less in unison subject to\r\nthe movements of wages and prices. This relative constancy proves how\r\nfundamental the arrangement of groups is.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to differentiate the constant from the variable expenses of\r\nrailroads on the basis of the foregoing operating statistics may now be\r\nmade. What proportion of each item in the table for each of the large\r\ngroups is fixed in amount; and what proportion fluctuates more or less\r\nin connection with the volume of traffic?\r\n\r\nUnder the first category, Maintenance of Way and Structures, absorbing\r\nabout one-fifth of operating expenses, over one-half is incurred for\r\nso-called \"repairs of roadway.\" It is evident that a large part of this\r\nexpense is due not to wear but to weather. A costly plant is exposed\r\nto every vicissitude of flood, fire, and waste. Re-ballasting and\r\nrealignment may be somewhat more expensive where traffic is heavy; but\r\ncertainly all general repairs, the wages of track walkers, the removal\r\nof snow, ice, and weeds, must be attended to entirely irrespective of\r\nthe number or size of passing trains. Of the second item, renewals\r\nof rails, it is probable that this expenditure is directly traceable\r\nto wear and tear in large part. The more trains, the heavier the\r\nlocomotive and cars or the higher the speed, the more rapidly must\r\nthese rails be replaced. But even so, the proportionate amount is\r\nsmall, constituting generally between five and ten per cent. only of\r\nthe group expenditure for maintenance of way. With ties, an item about\r\ntwice as important as rails, the case is exactly the reverse. Ties rot\r\nout rather than wear out. They have a natural life varying from four\r\nto fourteen years, as influenced by climate, ballast, and drainage.\r\nThe necessary expenditure per mile for them by different roads varies\r\ngreatly, as might be expected; but it seems to bear little relation\r\nto the density of traffic. As for the principal remaining items under\r\nMaintenance of Way, such as repairs of bridges and buildings; if\r\nproperly designed to withstand their loads and strains, most expenses\r\nof their up-keep such as repainting and reroofing should be practically\r\nindependent of the volume of business. A recent elaborate discussion of\r\nthese matters in 1907 in the Wisconsin Two-Cent Fare decision, reached\r\nthe conclusion that all of the cost of rails, one-third of the ties\r\nand ten per cent. of expenditures for roadway, track and bridges, are\r\nall that can properly be charged to wear from traffic, as opposed to\r\nnatural depreciation. Acworth illustrates this point by comparison of\r\nthe Midland & Great Western Railway of Ireland and the Lancashire &\r\nYorkshire Railroad. These two are of about equal length, approximately\r\n530 miles. The latter carries forty times the traffic of the former\r\nroad, and yet its expenses for maintenance of way are only eight\r\ntimes as much. It seems safe, in general, to conclude that in this\r\nfirst large group of expenditures for maintenance of the fixed plant,\r\nprobably not over one-third are variable to any considerable degree.\r\nAcworth for England estimates this proportion at about two-fifths.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of variable expenditures for Maintenance of\r\nEquipment--the second group--is probably higher than in that of\r\nmaintenance of way. This is due to two causes. Rolling stock is, of\r\ncourse, subjected more directly to wear and tear in service than are\r\nbridges, cuts and fills and buildings. Rolling stock, moreover, is\r\nsusceptible to change of type and improvement. Its effective life is\r\nthus shortened both by use and by replacement. Before being worn out it\r\nmay have become antiquated. More powerful locomotives and larger cars\r\nsuited to new requirements of the business may necessitate scrapping\r\notherwise good equipment. This very fact, however, imposes upon the\r\nmanagement the need of intensive service while it lasts. All the\r\nmileage possible must be extracted from each vehicle before it goes\r\nout of date, and this implies a higher proportion of wear-out than\r\nof mere rust-out. Yet the fact is still true that many of the items\r\nin this class are unaffected by the mileage or tonnage performance.\r\nThere is little difference in wear on a freight car as between light\r\nand moderately heavy loads; and as for passenger cars, the actual wear\r\nassignable to the paying load is a negligible quantity. We may, at all\r\nevents, risk an estimate in the statement that probably not over half\r\nof all the expenditures of a railroad for maintenance of equipment vary\r\nwith the volume of the business.\r\n\r\nThe direct effect of a changing volume of business is most clearly seen\r\nin the third group of operating expenses, having to do with Conducting\r\nTransportation. This is very important, comprising as shown by the\r\ntable on page 49, no less than fifty-five per cent. of operating outlay\r\nand forty per cent. of total expenditures including fixed charges. At\r\nfirst glance it would appear as if, at last, one had here to do with a\r\ndirect relativity between cost and volume of business. Surely the cost\r\nof fuel for motive power will vary with the tonnage moved! This item,\r\namounting in 1905 to no less than $156,000,000 for the railroads of the\r\nUnited States, was the largest in the budget, constituting eleven per\r\ncent. of all operating expenses. Yet brief consideration shows that\r\neven here much of this expense is constant and invariable. A locomotive\r\nwill burn fully one-third as much coal merely to move its own weight\r\nas to haul a loaded train. Five to ten per cent. of its total daily\r\nconsumption is required merely for firing up to the steaming point.\r\nTwenty-five to fifty pounds of coal per hour go to waste in holding\r\nsteam pressure while a freight train is waiting on a siding. Every\r\nstop of a train going thirty miles per hour dissipates energy enough\r\nto have carried it two miles along a level road. In brief, expert\r\nevidence shows that of this important expenditure for coal, from thirty\r\nto fifty per cent. is entirely independent of the number of cars or\r\nthe amount of freight hauled. The largest wage items in this group\r\nof conducting transportation expenses are for engine and roundhouse\r\nmen, and conductors and brakemen. This expense is, of course, even\r\nmore independent of the volume of business than the cost of coal. No\r\nmore engine men or conductors are needed for a heavy through express\r\nor freight train than for a single car tram on a branch line. And\r\nthe extra cost for service of more brakemen as the size of the train\r\nincreases, is relatively unimportant when modern equipment with air\r\nbrakes is used. Appreciation of this fact is largely responsible for\r\nthe great increase in train loads in recent years. Train-mile costs\r\ncan be economized most effectively by distributing the wages of a\r\ntrain crew over as large a tonnage as possible of paying freight. As\r\nfor the wages of station men, switch and flag men, they are largely,\r\nand often entirely, independent of the amount of business. From all\r\nthese considerations, it appears that at a conservative estimate, no\r\nless than fifty per cent. of the cost of conducting transportation\r\nconstitutes a fixed charge upon the property once it is in operation,\r\nirrespective of the volume of business transacted.\r\n\r\nThe group of general expenses, which alone remains for analysis, is\r\nrelatively small in amount. It is obvious that these outlays are a\r\nconstant burden but slightly influenced by the variation in traffic.\r\nSalaries may indeed be reduced somewhat during hard times--a few clerks\r\nmay be laid off; but, on the other hand, this being an expense of\r\norganization, the general staff must be maintained at about a certain\r\nstandard of efficiency regardless of business.\r\n\r\nSummarizing our estimates thus far, we may reconstruct a table,\r\ndistributing expenditures theoretically according as they are constant\r\nor variable in somewhat the following way:\r\n\r\n  ======================================================================\r\n                            |    Per cent. of    |    Per cent. of\r\n                            | operating expenses |   total expenses\r\n                            |--------------------+----------------------\r\n                            |      | Con- | Vari-|      | Con- | Vari-\r\n                            | Both | stant| able | Both | stant| able\r\n  --------------------------+------+------+------+------+------+--------\r\n  Maintenance of way        |  20  | 13.4 |  6.6 |  15  | 10   |  5\r\n  Maintenance of equipment  |  20  | 10   | 10   |  15  |  7.5 |  7.5\r\n  Conducting transportation |  56  | 28   | 28   |  40  | 20   | 20\r\n  General expenses          |   4  |  4   | --   |   3  |  3   | --\r\n                            |------+------+------|      |      |\r\n                            | 100  | 55.4 | 44.6 |      |      |\r\n  Fixed charges             |      |      |      |  27  | 27   | --\r\n                            |      |      |      |------+------+--------\r\n                            |      |      |      | 100  | 67.5 | 32.5\r\n  ======================================================================\r\n\r\nThus one arrives at the general conclusion that approximately\r\ntwo-thirds of the total expenditure of a railroad and more than\r\none-half of the actual operating expenses are independent of the volume\r\nof traffic. The remaining third of all expenditures, or what amounts\r\nto the same thing, the other half of the operating expenses, are\r\nimmediately responsive to any variation in business. Applied to the\r\nrailroad net of the United States, this means that only about one-third\r\nof the $2,000,000,000 disbursed in 1905--an amount equal to about two\r\nand one-half times the national debt--was susceptible of variation\r\naccording as the traffic expanded or decreased. This provisional\r\nestimate, defective principally because of inadequacy of the returns as\r\nto depreciation and replacement, agrees in the main with computations\r\nbased upon other data. The Vice-President of the Southern Pacific\r\nRailroad, in 1892, after extended investigation, arrived at precisely\r\nthe same general conclusion. The great German authority, Sax, estimates\r\nthat one-half of a road's operating outlay is constant and that this\r\noperating outgo equals about half the total expenditure, the other half\r\nbeing capital cost and hence constant. This calculation places the\r\nconstant factors even higher than ours, viz., at about three-fourths\r\nof the total expenditure. Eaton states that half of the operating\r\nexpenses respond to changes in the volume of traffic. Our estimate,\r\nabove detailed, seems to be in accord therefore with good authority,\r\nand differs but little from any of the reliable writers.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed in passing that the relative distribution of\r\noutgo above mentioned, varies greatly both as between different\r\nrailroads and, on the same road, as between different years.[33]\r\nDuring lean seasons the imperative need of reducing expenses generally\r\ninduces the heaviest inroads on expenditure for maintenance of way.\r\nNearly one-third of these expenditures can probably be postponed for\r\nshort periods without serious detriment to operation; but, of course,\r\nthere is for each property an irreducible minimum at which economy\r\nmust halt. On the other hand, the cost of moving each train, that is\r\nto say, the outlay for fuel and wages, cannot be greatly cut, although\r\nsome discontinuance of freight trains may take place. The most readily\r\npostponable outlay is therefore found in the department of maintenance\r\nof way. Two hundred ties per mile may be annually renewed instead\r\nof twice that number for a year or two. Heavy decreases in the wage\r\naccount for road and track men may be effected, sometimes at the\r\ncost of public safety perhaps, but none the less effectively from an\r\nimmediate fiscal point of view. A series of hard years thus always\r\nresults in heavy proportional curtailments of maintenance of way\r\nexpenses. In 1895, for instance, midway between the two worst years\r\nof the depression of 1893-1897, only 19.82 per cent. of operating\r\nexpenses was devoted to maintenance of way, with 15.76 per cent.\r\nexpended for maintenance of equipment.[34] Six years later, in the\r\nfull tide of prosperity, the outlay for maintenance of way had risen\r\nto 22.27 per cent. With over 350,000 freight cars idle on sidings, as\r\nduring the spring of 1908, expenditures on repairs of equipment may\r\ntemporarily be postponed. Depreciation rather than wear takes place.\r\nAn economy of about five per cent. may temporarily be effected in this\r\nwise. It is only with the return of prosperity that the temporary\r\npostponement of this expenditure makes itself felt. Economy at the\r\nexpense of efficiency is poor business policy in the long run. With\r\nthe revival of activity on the other hand, as in 1898, there may be\r\nwitnessed a sudden concentration of the postponed expenditures of\r\nthe preceding years. The Illinois Central was spending $1,400 per\r\nmile on maintenance of way in 1905, as against only $1,150 in 1897.\r\nA succession of fruitful years may, however, find the property so\r\nthoroughly kept up that some measure of relaxation in expenditures\r\nmay ensue. During these good years with heavy traffic, it is the\r\nmaintenance of equipment charges which tend to rise. Locomotives and\r\ncars are constantly in need of repair owing to hard usage. This was\r\na noticeable feature during the four years after 1900. The Illinois\r\nCentral, expending only $866 per mile for maintenance of equipment in\r\n1897, laid out $2,200 per mile for the same purpose in 1907.\r\n\r\nSometimes, as in January, 1903, or November, 1906, general wage\r\nincreases all along the line take place. These, of course, affect all\r\nbranches of the service. Supplies of all kinds may also enhance in\r\nprice. It was doubtless the rise in the price of coal which increased\r\nthe proportionate importance of the fuel item in the railroad budget of\r\nthe United States from 9.8 per cent. in 1900 to 11.8 per cent. in 1904.\r\nThe tremendous rise in expenses of all kinds in 1907 was not at first\r\nappreciated because of the large volume of traffic. It was only when\r\nthe sharp decline in business following the panic in October of that\r\nyear took place, that the full influence of this factor became apparent.\r\n\r\nAs between different roads also, the relative proportion of the various\r\nelements of cost will vary according to circumstances. Northern lines\r\nare exposed to heavy maintenance of way charges, owing to snow,\r\nice, and frost. In rugged districts or with heavy grades, expensive\r\noperation is apparent in high conducting transportation expenses. On\r\nthe Pennsylvania trunk line, rising to 2,100 ft. above sea level and\r\nwith many curves, the distribution of expenditures is quite different\r\nfrom that on the New York Central, which operates a straighter line at\r\nabout water grade. On the Union Pacific, movement expenses have been\r\nat times over fifty per cent. higher than on the St. Paul road, which\r\noperates in level country. It is a combination of high grades and poor\r\nequipment, which undoubtedly keeps the relative cost of conducting\r\ntransportation so high on the Erie. The proportion of local to through\r\nbusiness is of importance in this connection.[35] Railroads like\r\nthe Boston & Maine or the St. Paul system before 1908, because they\r\nhave so much local business, contrast strongly with others like the\r\nChicago Great Western, the Erie or the old Fitchburg Railroad. On the\r\nlatter roads the distribution of expenses is different, because their\r\nlarge volume of through traffic carried in bulk is so much cheaper to\r\nhandle. Obviously, the expense incident to frequent stops and loss\r\nof time, as well as in loading and unloading local business, will be\r\nmuch greater than in long haul trainload traffic. The cost of large\r\nitems like fuel will vary greatly in different parts of the country\r\nfrom perhaps $1.25 per ton for coal in Pennsylvania up to $7 or more\r\non the Pacific coast. Since the recent discoveries of petroleum in\r\nTexas and California, economies have been effected upon the Southern\r\nPacific, which by comparison with Northern Pacific, still using coal,\r\nmay be of great importance. More than six-tenths of the cost of\r\nlocomotive service is for fuel, so that a reduction of cost from $4\r\na ton to an oil equivalent at $1 per ton may aggregate a large sum.\r\nIt has been estimated that such a saving on 1,600,000 tons of coal\r\nwould pay five per cent. on an additional capital of $100,000,000.\r\nSimilarly the character of the freight, whether it be like coal, iron\r\nore or grain, cheaply handled, or merchandise which must be carefully\r\nhoused and treated; its regularity, whether it flows evenly the year\r\nround like the dressed beef business, or as on the cotton and cattle\r\nrange roads, is concentrated in a short season and all moves in one\r\ndirection;[36] the relative proportions of freight and passenger\r\nbusiness--in New England about on an equality, while in the West and\r\nSouth nearly nine-tenths freight; and, finally, the efficiency of\r\nmanagement, in the use of rolling stock, making up trainloads and\r\nkeeping all equipment busy; all of these factors will influence the\r\nproportionate distribution of expenditures. The operation of each road\r\nthus constitutes an interesting problem in statistical analysis by\r\nitself.[37]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _RELATION OF TRAFFIC TO MAINTENANCE OF WAY COSTS ON\r\nREPRESENTATIVE EASTERN AND WESTERN ROADS--1910_]\r\n\r\nThe relation of course between density of traffic and the distribution\r\nof expenditures is direct. Heavy and frequent trains increase the wear\r\nand tear as distinct from mere depreciation from age and weather. This\r\nis demonstrated graphically by the following diagram.[38] The solid\r\nblack horizontal belts to right of the centre show how low is the\r\ndensity of traffic on the five upper western roads by contrast with\r\nthe five carriers in trunk line territory. The left hand horizontal\r\nbelts show proportionally in dollars the outlay per mile of road for\r\nmaintenance. Naturally the expense of such maintenance is likewise\r\nless on the western lines. But when stated, not absolutely in dollars\r\nper mile of road but in terms of utilization, as by the shaded belts\r\nto right of the centre, the true state of things appears. Density\r\nconsidered, in other words, the western roads are all as well kept up\r\nas those in the East. The necessity at all times of interpreting such\r\nexpenditures, not in absolute figures but in terms of utilization, is\r\nobvious; and yet it is not always done in practice.\r\n\r\nUp to this point it has appeared as if, in making distinction between\r\nthe constant and variable expenditures of a railroad, it was the\r\nlatter only which grew as the volume of traffic increased. This is\r\nnot absolutely, but only relatively true, not only of the so-called\r\nconstant operating expenses, but of fixed charges as well.[39]\r\nEverything depends upon the length of time under consideration. Many\r\nexpenses follow the fluctuations of business, not evenly but by\r\njerks. Up to the full limit of utilization of the existing plant,\r\neach increment of traffic seems to necessitate but a very small\r\nincrease in the so-called variable expenses, with hardly any change\r\nat all in the constant ones. A branch road can haul more and more\r\ntons of freight with a given outfit of cars and locomotives by merely\r\nincreasing slightly its outlay for fuel, train service, wages and\r\nsupplies. But after a certain point more rolling stock must be provided\r\nto accommodate the growing business. As each of these additions to\r\nproperty occur, they contribute new quotas to the fixed charges and\r\nto the so-called constant expenses of operation, such as maintenance\r\nof roadway and the like. Nor can these new expenses be allocated to\r\nthe new business alone. The moment the old traffic has outgrown the\r\nexisting plant, the new expenditure becomes chargeable to all the\r\nbusiness alike. The new outgo must be distributed evenly over the\r\nentire volume of traffic thereafter handled. Each ton, both of old and\r\nof new traffic, beyond the haulage capacity of the locomotives then\r\nin service, is equally responsible for the expense of new equipment\r\npurchased. Although the old business could have been handled without\r\na million dollars spent for double-tracking or terminal enlargement,\r\nthis addition to the expense of maintenance of way or to the fixed\r\ncharges is equally attributable to every ton of traffic hauled.\r\n\r\nA concrete example may aid in making this important principle clear.\r\nThe new through-freight trunk line built by the Pennsylvania Railroad\r\nsince 1900, paralleling its old four-track one, represents both in the\r\ncost of maintenance and capital charges, a sudden jump in the expense\r\nof transporting each ton of freight on _both_ lines, until such time\r\nas the new business grows to a point where it can support the new line\r\nby itself alone. The relation between increasing returns and density\r\nof traffic is well illustrated in this instance. With six tracks in\r\noperation nearly all the way from Pittsburg to Philadelphia, the four\r\nold tracks are sometimes almost fully utilized for passengers and fast\r\nfreight. The extraordinary density of traffic appears in the statement\r\nthat this road in 1911 on 3534 miles of track handled one-third more\r\nton miles than the Union Pacific--by far the most worked of all the\r\nwestern lines--handled on 13,674 miles of track. The two new low-grade\r\nPennsylvania freight tracks are used only for slow traffic; largely\r\ncoal and westbound steel empties. Not-withstanding the extraordinary\r\ndensity of traffic on this extra two track line, it probably does\r\nnot meet the fixed charges on cost of construction of the line. Yet\r\nthe new double track was absolutely necessary, regardless of its\r\nprofitableness, in order to relieve congestion on the old four tracks.\r\nIn other words, the demands of the service forced an expenditure which\r\nin and of itself was not financially self-supporting. But the profit\r\nfrom the old lines would be sufficiently enhanced to take care of\r\nthe whole. The bearing of such cases upon the capital needs of the\r\nfuture is obvious. A resolutely conservative policy of finance becomes\r\nimperative under such circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn much the same way, the general condition of congestion reached\r\nin 1903-'05 on the eastern trunk lines and in the West and South in\r\n1906-'07, manifested mainly in the need for more tracks and terminals,\r\nrepresented the permanent outgrowth of the old plant; and necessitated\r\na readjustment of capital expenses for the purpose of enlargement.\r\nViewed in a large way over a term of years, nearly every expenditure,\r\neven the fixed charges which appear constant or independent of the\r\nvolume of business, thus become in reality imbued with more or less\r\nvariability.\r\n\r\nThe preceding considerations hold good not alone of increased\r\nfacilities, but of their curtailment as well. This point is often\r\nneglected in respect of capital outlay, which once made cannot be\r\nrecalled. Rotting of ties we have held to be a constant expense\r\nof operation. It goes on steadily, whether traffic conditions be\r\ngood or bad. But, on the other hand, those ties, if they be under\r\na third or fourth track, would never have been laid had not there\r\nbeen a promise of business sufficient to render the added investment\r\nprofitable. As Lorenz observes, \"the question is not, What expenditures\r\nwould disappear if a certain proportion of the traffic should be\r\ndiscontinued? but What expenditure would not now be incurred if that\r\ntraffic had never been called forth?\" Viewed in this way, even the\r\nnecessary replacement of ties under a (temporarily) little used extra\r\ntrack, is an expense determined at some time, even if not always, by\r\nthe volume of the business. In the long run, therefore, the percentage\r\nof total cost which we may assign to an increase in the volume of\r\ntraffic, is higher than appears from a cross-section of expenses,\r\ntaken, as was at first had, in a given year. Lorenz has illustrated\r\nthis steady expansion of all groups of expenditure in relation to\r\nexpansion of traffic by the following table, in which the actual\r\nfigures for each year [brought down to date] are replaced by an index\r\nnumber based upon 100 for the year 1895. It would have been highly\r\nsuggestive to continue all of this data alike to the present time; but,\r\nas noted on the table, certain items have been so modified by changes\r\nin accounting practice, that this could not be done.\r\n\r\n  ==================================================================\r\n       |Gross earnings from operation\r\n       |     |Ton miles\r\n       |     |       |Passenger miles\r\n       |     |       |       |Total operating expenses\r\n       |     |       |       |     |Maint. of way & structures\r\n       |     |       |       |     |       |Maintenance of equipment\r\n       |     |       |       |     |       |       |Conducting\r\n       |     |       |       |     |       |       |transportation\r\n       |     |       |       |     |       |       |       |Gen'l\r\n       |     |       |       |     |       |       |       |expenses\r\n  -----+-----+-------+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+--------\r\n  1895 | 100 | 100   | 100   | 100 | 100   | 100   | 100   | 100\r\n  1896 | 107 | 111.8 | 107   | 106 | 111.2 | 117.9 | 103.1 |  99.4\r\n  1897 | 104 | 111.6 | 100.5 | 103 | 108.5 | 106.4 |  99.8 |  98.4\r\n  1898 | 116 | 133.8 | 109.7 | 113 | 120.4 | 124.9 | 109.1 | 101.1\r\n  1899 | 122 | 145.1 | 119.7 | 118 | 126.8 | 134.6 | 115.6 | 110.0\r\n  1900 | 138 | 166.1 | 131.5 | 132 | 150.4 | 164.2 | 126.9 | 112.7\r\n  1901 | 147 | 172.5 | 142.3 | 142 | 164.6 | 173.2 | 135.5 | 121.8\r\n  1902 | 160 | 184.5 | 161.5 | 154 | 185.2 | 200.2 | 151.7 | 131.4\r\n  1903 | 176 | 203.2 | 171.6 | 173 | 198.6 | 225.6 | 174.7 | 142.1\r\n  1904 | 184 | 204   | 179.8 | 184 | 194.8 | 250.7 | 188.6 | 153.5\r\n  1905 | 193 | 219   | 195   | 191 | 191   | 253   | 179   | 154\r\n  1906 | 216 | 254   | 206.5 | 212 | 216   | 288.8 | 194   | 166\r\n  1907 | 240 | 277   | 227   | 241 | --[40]| --[40]| --[40]| --[40]\r\n  1908 | 222 | 256   | 238   | 230 |  --   |  --   |  --   |  --\r\n  1909 | 224 | 256   | 238   | 220 |  --   |  --   |  --   |  --\r\n  1910 | 256 | 300   | 265   | 251 |  --   |  --   |  --   |  --\r\n  ==================================================================\r\n\r\nAccording to this showing, maintenance of equipment, which we held in\r\nour analysis to be about one-half a constant expense and independent\r\nof traffic, especially after 1900, appears to have actually outrun\r\nthe expansion of ton-mileage and passenger business. How largely\r\nthis is due to actual purchases for the sake of future growth is\r\nnot determinable. And maintenance of way outlay--one of our largely\r\nconstant expenses--has increased, in fact, more rapidly than conducting\r\ntransportation, which we held to be mainly variable. But these\r\nfigures are confused by the failure to differentiate in the accounts,\r\nmere maintenance from actual improvements and additions to plant.\r\nExpenditures for these latter purposes, charged to operating expenses\r\nrather than to capital account, have been so enormous during these\r\nyears of prosperity that they confuse the true facts utterly. It is\r\nto be hoped that now with the revised statistics since 1906, which\r\nwill permit a clearer definition of these expenditures in detail,\r\nan analysis covering a series of years will bring out the real\r\nrelationships. Equally important is the fact that these years have been\r\ncharacterized by rapid and extensive rises, both of prices and wages.\r\nHad our table covered a longer series of years the results would have\r\nbeen more clear. Until such an analysis be made, it will suffice for\r\nour purpose, viz., the analysis of the principles of railroad rate\r\nmaking, that we adhere to our first general conclusion, namely--that\r\nof the total expenditures of a railroad _at any given time_ about\r\ntwo-thirds of them are constant, while only one-third vary with the\r\nups and downs of the volume of traffic. Comprehending in survey a long\r\nperiod of years, it might happen, as Acworth concludes, that nearly\r\none-half of the total expenditures were entirely fixed in character,\r\nleaving the other half as dependent upon the amount of transportation\r\neffected.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which heavy capital outlay for maintenance accompanies\r\nas well as partly accounts for a decline in the cost of conducting\r\ntransportation on American roads, is graphically shown by the diagram\r\non the next page.[41] During ten years a steady decline in direct\r\noperating costs has accompanied an equally marked upward tendency in\r\nexpense of maintenance. The bearing of this on the problem of rate\r\nadvances in future is direct. Profitableness results from two separate\r\nsources; economical operation such as longer trains and better loading,\r\nand also from far heavier capital investment in plant, by which such\r\noperation is rendered possible.[42] Both alike, however, attend upon\r\nincreased volume of business. Heavy capital investment may lessen\r\nimmediate maintenance charges,--lower grades and straighter alignment\r\nnaturally wearing less; but, on the other hand, the burden of interest\r\nand other fixed expenses steadily grows. How will they stand toward\r\none another by 1925 on the eastern trunk lines? Will growth of business\r\nbring lower rates or not? A fine field for further analysis is as yet\r\nunworked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _RATIO OF MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTY AND CONDUCTING\r\nTRANSPORTATION TO TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSE._]\r\n\r\nOne final relation between operating and fixed expenses is left for\r\nconsideration. It is so well put by J. Shirley Eaton in an unpublished\r\npaper, that it can best be stated in his own words:\r\n\r\n    \"It is impossible to have an absolute and universal line of\r\n    demarcation between the direct and the fixed expense, that\r\n    shall be the same on all roads. One road chooses to reduce\r\n    a grade and thereby increase the capital account in order\r\n    to save in the current expense of a helper at a hill or the\r\n    lost margin of efficiency of the loaded train on the level.\r\n    The relation between a current expense and the annual charge\r\n    of the capitalized cost on a fixed plant that performed the\r\n    same service, was well illustrated in a case arbitrated by\r\n    Mr. Blanchard in New Orleans. One road which did not have\r\n    access to the heart of the city undertook to compensate its\r\n    disadvantage by trucking to and from its depot. The hire of\r\n    a public truckman to perform the service for its patrons was\r\n    very soon commuted to the practice of paying the amount of\r\n    the truck expense to the consignee by deducting it from the\r\n    freight bill rendered, the consignee or shipper performing the\r\n    service. This, known as 'drayage equalization,' was claimed by\r\n    competitors to be in the nature of a rebate to secure business.\r\n    The arbitrator decided that the first roads had elected to buy\r\n    their right of way into the heart of the city; and the road\r\n    that had not built into the city elected to pay the expense of\r\n    the same service in the shape of a current drayage bill instead\r\n    of in the shape of interest on money invested in right of way.\r\n    Therefore he decided there was no cause for complaint.\"[43]\r\n\r\nRailroad expenditures, as Taussig clearly pointed out a number of years\r\nago,[44] afford a prime illustration of the production of several\r\ncommodities by a single great plant simultaneously at joint and\r\nindistinguishable cost. The classic economists illustrated this law by\r\nthe joint production of wool and mutton and of gas and coke. In both of\r\nthese instances neither commodity could conceivably be produced alone.\r\nNor was either one, so to speak, a by-product of the other. So nearly\r\nof equal importance are the two, in fact, that the cost of production\r\nfor each may approximately be determined by dividing the total cost\r\naccording to the relative worths of the two or more products. The\r\nlaw of joint cost with reference to the production of transportation\r\nis somewhat different. Compare, for instance, the carriage by a\r\nrailroad of thousands of passengers and different commodities in every\r\ndirection, under varying conditions, singly or by wholesale, slowly or\r\nby express, over a given set of rails every day; with the operation\r\nof a great refinery producing simultaneously kerosene, gasoline,\r\nlubricating oils and greases as well as various odd chemicals. Both\r\nare examples of production at joint cost, but with various important\r\ncontrasts. In the refinery all the costs are joint. All the processes\r\nare interlocked. Every increase in the output of kerosene produces\r\n_pari passu_ an increase of the other commodities. On the railroad not\r\nall, but only a part of the costs are joint, in such manner as has\r\nbeen shown. For, from the joint portion of its plant--roadway rails\r\nand locomotives--the railroad may produce transportation of different\r\nsorts quite independently. It may choose to especially cultivate its\r\npassenger traffic, or its cotton or coal business. After a certain\r\npoint of congestion is reached, the various sorts of traffic on the\r\nrailroad may even become actually competitive with one another so far\r\nas the joint use of the plant is concerned. It is plain that this\r\ncould never happen in the refinery. The use of more stills for making\r\nkerosene would automatically produce more by-products of every sort.\r\nBut on a railroad it might well happen that the coal and passenger\r\nbusiness might come to interfere with one another. A choice of emphasis\r\nas between fast refrigerator beef or fruit traffic, and limited express\r\nservice, may have to be made on a long single track line. Nevertheless,\r\nin spite of these peculiarities of transportation, the general law\r\nof joint costs holds good, in that it is a demand for each service\r\nrather than its cost which finally determines the chargeable rate.[45]\r\nThis must be so, because of the fact that the cost of each shipment\r\nis so largely joint and indeterminate, and that a large part of the\r\nentire plant is indistinguishably devoted to the general production of\r\ntransportation without reference to particular units of business. One\r\nconcrete example may serve to illustrate this point.\r\n\r\nFor years attempts have been unsuccessfully made by accountants to\r\neffect the primary separation between expenses of passenger and freight\r\nbusiness,[46] in order to determine the cost of transportation per\r\nunit in each case. Some companies like the Louisville & Nashville\r\nand the Burlington system, still divide up the two, usually on the\r\nbasis of the engine mileage for each class of traffic. This may be\r\nserviceable enough for comparisons of costs from year to year in the\r\nsame company, but it has no general value and it may, moreover, become\r\nhighly misleading. The most absurd conclusions may result. Thus at one\r\ntime it appeared from such data, compiled by the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission, that the New York Central, with five times the density of\r\ntraffic of the Illinois Central, was actually conducting its freight\r\nbusiness at a much higher cost per ton mile. Such inconsistencies\r\ninduced the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1894 to abandon the\r\nattempt at any such primary separation of accounts.[47] It has since\r\nbeen reattempted, in special cases, as by the Wisconsin Railroad\r\nCommission in its notable \"Two-cent Fare\" decision in 1907, the\r\ndivision being made according to a number of different criteria.[48]\r\n\r\nBut it is plain that a very large proportion--probably over half--of\r\nthe expenditures for freight and passenger business are entirely joint,\r\nhowever distinct the revenues from each service may be. We have seen\r\nthat approximately two-thirds of the outgo is incurred on behalf of\r\nthe property as a whole. Certain expenses, to be sure, such as train\r\nwages, coal consumption and the maintenance of rolling stock, are\r\nreadily divisible; but with respect to the maintenance of way and\r\nstructures--about forty per cent. of the total outgo--all guides fail.\r\nEven in respect of the cost of rails, due to wear and tear of train\r\nmovement, we are quite at sea in the allocation of expenses. Freight\r\ntrains may indeed be four times as heavy as passenger trains; but, on\r\nthe other hand, they move at far slower speeds. And then, finally, how\r\nabout the large item of capital cost, the proportion of outgo for\r\nfixed charges? This equals about twenty-seven per cent. of the total\r\nexpenditures for the United States as a whole. We may, of course,\r\ndivide these expenses arbitrarily on the basis of the relative gross\r\nrevenue from freight and passenger business respectively. And yet how\r\nabsurd it would be to attempt to allocate an expense of a million\r\ndollars for the abolition of grade crossings in this way. As between\r\nthe New Haven road, with passenger and freight revenues about equal,\r\nand a western road with only one-tenth of its income derived from\r\npassengers, the apparent cost of freight business on the eastern road\r\nwould be absurdly reduced by any such process. The facts are plain.\r\nSo many expenditures are incurred indiscriminately on behalf of the\r\nservice as a whole--being an indispensable condition for operation\r\nof the property at all--that no logical distinction of expense even\r\nas between passenger and freight traffic is possible. This being so,\r\nhow futile it is to expect to be able to set off the expenses due to\r\nany particular portion either of freight or passenger service, and\r\nespecially to any individual shipment. It may oftentimes be possible\r\nto determine the _extra_ cost due to individual shipments. This, of\r\ncourse, mainly applies to what are called movement expenses. Thus the\r\nhaulage cost of a 2,000-ton grain train from Chicago to New York has\r\nbeen estimated at $520. But how small a part this is of the total\r\ncost, the preceding analysis must have made clear. In the Texas Cattle\r\nRaisers' case, detailed analysis of the extra cost for the traffic\r\nin cattle was presented.[49] The starting point in this attempt was\r\nnecessarily an allocation of freight and passenger expenditures, which,\r\nif defective, would vitiate the entire subsequent calculation as to\r\ncosts. In this instance, it was the judgment of the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission in its final decision in 1908, that no such separation of\r\nexpenditures was possible as a basis for the determination of cost of\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[29] _Quarterly Journal of Economics_, XXII, 1908, p. 364 _et. seq._\r\n\r\n[30] U.

Each ton of freight added to the existing traffic\r\ncosts relatively less to haul. From this it follows, obviously, that\r\nthe net returns increase more than proportionately with the expansion\r\nof traffic. This may be demonstrated by a simple calculation. It has\r\nalready been shown that only about two-thirds of the total expenditures\r\nof a railroad are applied to operation, the remaining third being\r\ndevoted to capital account. Moreover, of these two-thirds of the total\r\napplied to operating outlay, only about one-half responds to any change\r\nin the tonnage, the other half being constant up to a certain point.\r\nOtherwise expressed, an increase of one per cent, in traffic and,\r\ntherefore, of revenue, produces an increase in expense of only one-half\r\nof two-thirds of one per cent.[50] Two-thirds of the entire increment\r\nof revenue goes to profit. Carry this increase further and the effect\r\nis more striking. Suppose traffic to grow tenfold. The former outlay\r\nbeing $100 for a given volume of business, would be divided according\r\nto our rule as follows: one-third for fixed charges, one-third for\r\nconstant operating outlay and one-third for variable expenses. With ten\r\ntimes as much traffic, only the last group of outgoes will expand. One\r\nthousand dollars revenue would therefore become available under the new\r\nconditions, to pay the same fixed charges as well as constant operating\r\ncosts. The total outgo would thus become $33 plus $33 plus $330, or\r\n$396 in all. Almost two-thirds of the increment of revenue still\r\nremains as profit. It might well happen that such an expansion could\r\nnot ensue without large increases in the capital and plant, as has\r\nalready been noted; but up to that point this calculation would hold\r\ngood. The following statement varying but slightly from our foregoing\r\nassumptions, illustrates the principle.[51] Let the distribution of\r\nexpenditures for given conditions, producing $100 of revenue, be these,\r\nviz.:\r\n\r\n  Operating expenses       $ 67\r\n  Fixed charges            $ 28\r\n                           ----\r\n                           $ 95\r\n  Profits for dividends    $  5\r\n                           ----\r\n                           $100\r\n\r\nNow assume an increase of ten per cent. in the traffic and consequently\r\nin the revenue; but assume also that the average _extra_ cost per\r\nunit, of the new business, is only forty per cent. as much as for the\r\npreëxisting tonnage. Were the added cost of each ton mile as great as\r\nbefore, the operating expenses would rise by the full ten per cent. of\r\n$67. But on Webb's assumption, they will rise by only forty per cent.\r\nof ten per cent. The new account would then stand thus:\r\n\r\n  Operating expenses ($67 plus forty per cent. of\r\n  ten per cent. of $67)                            $ 69.68\r\n  Fixed charges as before                          $ 28.00\r\n                                                   -------\r\n                                                   $ 97.68\r\n  Income, increased by ten per cent.               $110.00\r\n                                                   -------\r\n  Balance for profit or dividends                  $ 12.32\r\n\r\nBy an increase of ten per cent. in tonnage, balance for dividends has\r\nmore than doubled.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it will be noted that a constant rate of return per\r\nunit of business newly acquired has been assumed. Attempts were made\r\non behalf of the railroads, during the long period of decline of ton\r\nmile revenue down to 1900, by Newcomb and others, to show that this is\r\nan unreasonable assumption; in that increased traffic is presumably\r\nto be had only by a progressive lowering of the rates charged. This\r\ncontention has been effectively demolished by the steady and remarkable\r\ngrowth of traffic since 1900, even in the face of a substantial rise\r\nof rates all along the line. A necessary corollary to our proposition,\r\nbeside that of the maintenance of a constant scale of charges, is, of\r\ncourse, also of the continuance of a given grade of service and of\r\ncosts of operation. If more luxuriously appointed passenger trains or\r\nquicker freight service have to be given in order to produce the growth\r\nof business, the added costs of operation must, naturally, be taken\r\ninto consideration. If widespread rise of wages follows an increase in\r\nthe general cost of living, that too is an entirely extraneous factor.\r\nBut with a given grade of service, constant rates and steady wage\r\nscales, there can be no question, up to the point of full utilization\r\nof the existing plant, that the operation of railroads affords clear\r\ndemonstration of the law of increasing returns.\r\n\r\nThe obverse side of the law of increasing returns is also of great\r\nimportance. For the same reason that when traffic increases, only a\r\nportion of the expenses are affected, it follows that, when business\r\ndeclines, only a part of the costs can be lopped off. In other words,\r\na reduction in the volume of traffic does not in itself alone lead to\r\na corresponding reduction in the operating expenses. Of course, many\r\nof these latter may, as we have seen, be temporarily postponed, as\r\nthey were in 1893-1897, especially in the group of maintenance-of-way\r\nexpenses. In such an event they must ultimately be made good by\r\nextraordinary outlay at some later time. But, unless they be thus\r\npostponed and unless the rates charged for service be reduced in order\r\nto stimulate traffic, it is inevitable that the margin of profit will\r\ndrop as rapidly as it tends to rise with increased volume of business.\r\nThis may be illustrated by the following computation.[52] Assume the\r\ntotal revenue from a given business to be $100, and assume it to be\r\ndistributed as before, viz.:\r\n\r\n  Operating expenses   $ 67\r\n  Fixed charges        $ 28\r\n                       ----\r\n                       $ 95\r\n  Leaving profit       $  5\r\n                       ----\r\n  Total                $100\r\n\r\nA positive decline of ten per cent, in the tonnage, if the cost for\r\noperation per unit of the portion lost was the same as the rest, would\r\nobviously reduce the operating expenses also by ten per cent. Let it\r\nnext be assumed, as was done previously, that the average extra cost\r\nper unit of the latest increment of business was only forty per cent.\r\nas much as for the remainder of the tonnage. How closely this will\r\napproximate the facts in any particular instance will depend upon the\r\ndensity of traffic attained in relation to the capacity of the existing\r\nplant. If the addition of the last ten per cent. of business did not\r\nincrease the large proportion of fixed expenses at all, and only added\r\nforty per cent. per unit more to the variable expenses; per contra, the\r\nloss of it would merely reduce the variable expenses and still leave\r\nthe constant outlay the same. On this assumption, by the loss of ten\r\nper cent. of business the total amount of operating expenses under the\r\nnew conditions would be lessened, not by ten per cent. of $67, but\r\nby only forty per cent. of ten per cent. of $67. The income would,\r\nhowever, decline by the full amount of ten per cent. The account, after\r\na loss of ten per cent. of business, would then stand somewhat as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Operating expenses ($67 less forty per cent. of\r\n  ten per cent. of $67)                            $64.32\r\n  Fixed charges, as before                         $28.00\r\n                                                   ------\r\n                                                   $92.32\r\n  Income, reduced by ten per cent.                 $90.00\r\n                                                   ------\r\n  Leaving a deficit of                              $2.32\r\n\r\nOr, in other words, a decline of ten per cent. in tonnage has\r\ntransmuted a five per cent. dividend condition into one involving an\r\nactual deficit nearly half as great as the former profit. The sudden\r\nreversal from apparent prosperity to very real distress, such as\r\noccurred during the fall of 1907, is thus explained. Its suddenness\r\nmay be shown by the following table of monthly gross and net earnings,\r\npromulgated by the Interstate Commerce Commission.[53] The acute panic\r\noccurred during October, but its effect was not apparent until the\r\nfollowing month. The total mileage included is shown by the first\r\ncolumn:\r\n\r\n  ===============================================\r\n       |           |         |     Earnings\r\n       |           |         |   --per mile--\r\n       |           |         |-------------------\r\n       |           | Mileage |  Gross  |   Net\r\n  -----+-----------+---------+---------+---------\r\n  1907 | July      | 223,900 |  $1,022 |  $304\r\n  1907 | August    | 224,100 |  $1,079 |  $345\r\n  1907 | September | 224,300 |  $1,045 |  $314\r\n  1907 | October   | 224,700 |  $1,116 |  $337\r\n  1907 | November  | 224,800 |    $981 |  $261\r\n  1907 | December  | 224,400 |    $861 |  $197\r\n  1908 | January   | 198,700 |    $746 |  $148\r\n  ===============================================\r\n\r\nThis table shows that whereas under full prosperity, up to and including\r\nthe month of October, the net revenue was about thirty per cent. of\r\ngross; after the sharp decline in traffic, it dropped in November to\r\ntwenty-six per cent., and progressively thereafter to twenty per cent.\r\nin January. In other words, a decline of about one-fourth in the gross\r\nrevenue within four months, entailed a loss of over fifty per cent.\r\nin net earnings. Higher operating expenses in the winter may have\r\nexaggerated this tendency, but, on the other hand, drastic economies\r\nwere put into effect, which would more than offset the difference.\r\n\r\nThe urgent need of at once meeting any loss of business by prompt\r\nreduction of operating expenses is apparent. But there is comfort to\r\nbe found at this point in the fact that each one per cent. saved in\r\noperation at any given time, results in saving two per cent. for the\r\nnet earnings. According to our estimates, and as a rule practically,\r\noperating expenses equal about two-thirds of gross revenue, leaving\r\none-third to meet charges and pay dividends. Every reduction from\r\nthis two-thirds of gross revenue, therefore, transferred to the\r\nbalance, increases the latter proportionately twice as much. This\r\nfact in turn explains the urgent pressure always brought to bear at\r\nsuch times to effect economies all along the line. These are too\r\noften indiscriminately made.[54] Such paring down of expenses should\r\nalways be made with an eye to their ultimate effect upon the operating\r\nefficiency of the property in the long run. To postpone much-needed\r\nrepairs of equipment during a period of depression, like that of\r\n1907-1908, when repair shop costs are at a low ebb, only to hamper\r\noperations and to effect repairs under pressure when business revives,\r\nis an instance of such wasteful economy.\r\n\r\nThe qualification of the law of increasing returns as applied to\r\nrailroads, arising from the distinction between long and short term\r\nproduction of its commodity--transportation--as above described, is\r\nof course by no means confined to carriers alone. It holds good of\r\na factory or mercantile establishment as well. But in the case of\r\nrailways, it is emphasized by the abruptness with which the condition\r\nof congestion of plant arises. The limit of full working capacity\r\nin a factory is elastic, by reason of the fact that under the \"peak\r\nof load\"--in busy seasons--it may prolong operations beyond the\r\ndaylight hours or, at worst, work all night by double shifts. But a\r\nrailroad, customarily working by night as well as by day and thus\r\ndistributing its operations over the entire twenty-four hours, enjoys\r\nno such expansible limits upon utilization of its plant. When such\r\nfull utilization is attained, the end comes suddenly. No postponement\r\nto a more favorable time for raising funds for better terminals or\r\nfour tracking the main line is possible; nor does its character as a\r\npublic servant permit a railroad to curtail service. The dead wall\r\nof congestion cannot be gotten around by either path. A crisis is\r\npresented, calling for the most heroic measures. This, of course, still\r\nfurther emphasizes the need for a long look ahead into the future with\r\nrespect to railroad finance; not for the management alone, but for the\r\ngovernment as well, charged as it is at present with control over rates\r\nfor service.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe application of the law of increasing returns to railroads in actual\r\npractice is beset with difficulties. In order to make these clear, it\r\nwill be necessary first to describe the phenomenal development of this\r\ncountry which has taken place during the last two decades.\r\n\r\nThe freight service of the railroads of the United States, measured by\r\nweight, in 1910, amounted to 1,026,000,000 tons. Only since 1899 when\r\nthe corresponding figure given by the Interstate Commerce Commission\r\nwas 501,000,000 tons, have accurate data been obtainable. This would\r\nindicate a growth in ten years of about one hundred per cent. But\r\nthis figure takes no account of the distance each ton of freight\r\ntravels. This factor is included in what is known as ton mileage--that\r\nis to say, the equivalent of the number of tons of freight carried\r\none mile. Obviously, so far as the amount of service rendered is\r\nconcerned, one ton carried a hundred miles is the equivalent of one\r\nhundred tons transported one mile. Every carrier totalizes in this\r\nway each ton of freight movement by multiplying it into the distance\r\ntransported. For the United States as a whole, this ton mileage in\r\n1910 was 255,016,000,000--that is to say, the service rendered would\r\nbe represented by the carriage of that number of tons one mile.\r\nThe appended diagram shows the phenomenal rapidity with which this\r\ntransportation service has grown since 1899. The scale on the left hand\r\nside of the chart serves this purpose. The right hand scale indicates\r\nthe miles of line in operation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Relative Growth of Mileage and Traffic]\r\n\r\nThe rapid growth up to 1893 was suddenly interrupted by panic and\r\nsubsequent industrial depression lasting for about four years.\r\nRecovery began in 1897, since which time the freight movement has\r\nincreased by leaps and bounds from about 95,000,000,000 ton miles\r\nto 255,016,000,000 ton miles in 1910. It is obvious that the growth\r\nof transportation in any country is bound to be more rapid than the\r\nincrease either in population or in wealth. It appears, indeed, almost\r\nas if the volume of transportation in the United States increased\r\nmore nearly as the square of population than in direct proportion.\r\nIt has been estimated that we forward two and a half times as much\r\nfreight _per capita_ as some of the leading European countries like\r\nFrance. Our domestic population from 1890 to 1910 increased about\r\nfifty per cent. The railroad mileage grew at about the same rate. Yet\r\nthe freight service surpassed this rate of growth more than six times\r\nover; and the passenger service augmented nearly as much. Both alike in\r\n1910 were practically three times as great in volume as twenty years\r\nbefore. The diagram on page 78 is intended to illustrate the relative\r\nrapidity of this development. While population and mileage increased\r\nabout one half, the railroads in 1910 hauled the equivalent of three\r\ntimes the volume of freight traffic handled in 1890. At the beginning\r\nof this period, the railroads had to seek the freight. Now it appears\r\nthat traffic normally will seek the railroads. At times, even, as in\r\n1906-1907, the railroads have actually sought to escape the flood of\r\nbusiness presented.\r\n\r\nThe magnitude and importance of the growth of tonnage, as above\r\ndescribed, is revealed by the rapid increase in railroad earnings. The\r\ncourse of these is shown by the succeeding chart on page 82. Gross\r\nrevenues of American railroads in 1889 were about one billion dollars.\r\nIn 1910 they amounted to $2,750,000,000. Thus it appears that gross\r\nearnings almost equalled three times the amount of twenty years ago.\r\nThe net income available for dividends has grown even faster. The\r\nincrease was, roughly speaking, about five fold; namely, from 101\r\nmillions in 1889 to 515 millions in 1910. Nearly three and one-half\r\ntimes as much money went annually to the owners of railroad securities\r\nas dividends and interest, besides leaving surplus earnings for 1910\r\nof about 222 millions available for improvements and surplus. But the\r\nlimit of utilization seems to have been about reached on many roads\r\nin 1906; and an era of extensive new capital outlay to increase the\r\nexisting plants and facilities ensued. Indications are not lacking to\r\nshow that at the height of activity before the industrial collapse of\r\n1907-1908, such a point of saturation had been reached, especially in\r\ntrunk line territory and on the northern transcontinental lines.[55]\r\nOn the Northern Pacific, for instance, the ton mileage increased from\r\n2.2 billions to 5.2 billions between 1900 and 1906. The Northwest\r\nwas suddenly confronted at that time with the new issue of enlarging\r\nfacilities, which had been slowly becoming apparent elsewhere in the\r\ncountry during the preceding decade. Grain actually rotted on the\r\nground, and an acute coal famine occurred, because of sheer inability\r\nof the roads to care for the new traffic. Changes in methods of\r\nbusiness also somewhat exaggerated this strain upon the carriers.\r\nMerchants now expect quick delivery to order. They object to stocking\r\nup months ahead, even when conditions are auspicious; therefore,\r\nbusiness, when especially stimulated, comes with an irresistible\r\nrush. All these causes, coupled with undiscriminating attempts by\r\ninadequately bedded roads to imitate the methods of progressive ones by\r\nprematurely increasing their train loads, led to a practical breakdown\r\nof the transportation business of the country in the autumn of 1906. To\r\nthe student of transportation, this congestion denoted the attainment\r\nof a point of saturation for the then-existing physical plant. The\r\nanalogy to the case of the Pennsylvania Railroad, previously described,\r\nis obvious. Such a predicament is bound to arise in the development of\r\nany carrier in a rapidly growing country. Its fiscal significance will\r\nappear in due time.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the growth of business and of operating expenses for\r\nthe entire railroad system of the United States over a series of years\r\nis given in the following table. The results are expressed by means of\r\nindex numbers based upon the year 1880, taken as 100.[56]\r\n\r\n       RELATIVE INCREASE IN TRAFFIC ITEMS, OPERATING EXPENSES AND\r\n                  REVENUE FROM 1880 TO 1906, INCLUSIVE\r\n\r\n  ======================================================================\r\n                       |       --Average, from and inclusive--\r\n         Items         |     |  1881  |  1886  |  1891  |  1896  |  1904\r\n                       | 1880|   to   |   to   |   to   |   to   |   to\r\n                       |     |  1885  |  1890  |  1895  |  1898  |  1906\r\n  ---------------------+-----+--------+--------+--------+--------+------\r\n  Ton miles of freight | 100 | 134.36 | 203.23 | 264.90 | 313.81 | 595.0\r\n  Passenger miles of   |     |        |        |        |        |\r\n    passengers.        | 100 | 138.12 | 189.46 | 233.15 | 224.65 | 412.0\r\n  Operating expenses   | 100 | 132.75 | 174.39 | 215.30 | 221.42 | 394.0\r\n  Gross income from    |     |        |        |        |        |\r\n    operation          | 100 |  --    |  --    | 183.0  | 190.0  | 346.0\r\n  ======================================================================\r\n\r\nFrom this table it appears that between 1880 and 1906 the ton mileage\r\nof freight increased about six fold, and the passenger business more\r\nthan four fold. Operating expenses, on the other hand, were in 1906\r\nless than four times as great as in 1880. Increasing returns are quite\r\nevident. The period from 1880 down to 1896-1898, before the recent\r\ngeneral increases in prices and wages took place, shows this even more\r\nstrikingly. In order to transport more than three times as much freight\r\nand two and one-quarter times as many passengers, it required a direct\r\noutlay for operation of little more than twice as much money.[57] On\r\nthe other hand, owing to the rapid rise of all operating costs since\r\n1898, a comparison of expenditures confined to the last ten years by\r\nthemselves, affords an apparent contradiction. The results for this\r\nperiod have already been given, classified in greater detail. And\r\nyet, despite this disturbing factor and the one earlier mentioned\r\nthat these later operating expenses have been heavily loaded with\r\nimprovement expenditures, it appears by comparison of 1895 with 1905,\r\nthat passenger business has more than doubled, and freight business is\r\ntwo and a half times as great, while operating expenses in 1905 were\r\nnot much over twice their amount ten years before.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARNINGS & EXPENSES]\r\n\r\nA comparison of the movement of gross earnings with operating expenses\r\nintroduces still another disturbing factor, namely, the changes from\r\nyear to year in the level of freight rates as well as in the character\r\nof the traffic handled. The effect of fluctuating costs of production\r\nof transportation having just been considered, we may now turn to the\r\nfiscal returns as affected by the price obtainable for the service\r\ngiven. Any long-time comparison of results reflects the influence of\r\nthe steady decline of freight rates during the generation prior to\r\n1900. Thus comparing 1880 with 1898, as shown by the preceding table,\r\noperating expenses grew in the ratio of 100 to 221, while gross income\r\ngrew from 100 to only 190. Three fold the freight business produced\r\nless than twice the revenue. Pushing the comparison later, down to\r\n1906, operating expenses grew after 1880 from 100 to 394, while gross\r\nincome rose to only 346. This reflects the influence during the last\r\nfew years of the rapid rise in prices and wages.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAccording to the opposite diagram, comparing 1890 with 1910, both\r\noperating expenses and gross income from operation seem to have\r\nmoved together; the curve of gross revenue rising proportionately\r\nonly a little faster than that for operating expenses. The latter\r\nhave risen from a general figure of about $800,000,000 before the\r\ndepression of 1893-1897, to $1,822,000,000 in 1910; the former from\r\nabout $1,200,000,000 to over $2,750,000,000. Both alike somewhat more\r\nthan doubled, therefore, in twenty years. At times, especially during\r\nthe rapid revival of business after 1897, before rising prices began\r\nto affect costs of operation, extraordinary increases in earnings\r\nappeared, outstripping the growth of expenditures. Comparing the year\r\n1899 with 1895 we find that the gross earnings of the railroads of\r\nthe United States increased by twenty-two per cent. This involved\r\nan increased expense of operation, however, of only eighteen per\r\ncent. Similar comparison year by year, there having been an enormous\r\nexpansion of business, shows an increase in gross earnings somewhat\r\nmore rapid than the growth of operating expenses. This differential\r\nadvantage has progressively lessened since 1902, and especially since\r\nthe let-up in 1907. The official returns for 1911 with the marked\r\ndecline in gross, show an even more distinct drop in net earnings.\r\nWhether the need of an increase of rates commensurate with the\r\naugmented operating costs is imperative, can only be ascertained after\r\na return to more normal business conditions.\r\n\r\nThese relationships would be the more striking could we exclude the\r\nenormous expenditures for betterments which have been charged to\r\noperating expenses during these years. Comparisons of net earnings\r\nare vitiated by uncertainty upon this point. Working over these\r\nresults by comparison per mile of line, it appears that the rate of\r\nincrease in earnings per mile of line for five years prior to 1900,\r\nwas approximately double the rate of increase of operating expenses\r\nper mile of line. The greatly lessened cost of performing additional\r\nbusiness becomes at once apparent. But these latter conclusions, as has\r\nbeen said, cover only a brief period of time. Judging by the results\r\nover many years, it appears that changes both in the level of freight\r\nrates and of wages and prices have operated to leave the railroads not\r\nmuch better off than they were some time ago. The only thing which has\r\nsaved them whole in the face of rising prices and wages since 1900,\r\nand especially since 1907, has been the rise of freight rates and the\r\nenforced improvements in operation. With the methods of transportation,\r\nsuch as size of cars and locomotives and train loads, as they were a\r\ndecade ago, very real distress would be more widely apparent than it\r\nis. On the whole, the public seems to have shared in the benefits of\r\nthese improvements to a considerable degree. This statement, however\r\ntrue for the entire railroad system of the country as a whole, does not\r\nby any means represent the facts for any single system. Moreover, it\r\nis not by any means clear how fully the railroad system of the country\r\nhas been enlarged and improved out of surplus earnings. There is reason\r\nto think that foundations in some cases--the Pennsylvania road, for\r\nexample--have been laid during these prosperous years, for largely\r\nincreased tonnage in the immediate future without a corresponding\r\ngrowth of expenses chargeable to plant; in other words, that the\r\ntransition to a distinctly higher grade of operation has been effected\r\nout of surplus earnings.\r\n\r\nThe comparison of gross and net earnings from operation, if\r\nexpenditures have grown almost as fast as gross income, confirms the\r\npreceding conclusions. Surveying the chart for the period since 1890,\r\nit appears that net earnings for the railroads of the United States\r\nhave more nearly trebled than doubled; the increase having been 177\r\nper cent. up to 1910. This takes no account whatever of the immense\r\nvolume of new capital added to the system. The entirely distinct\r\nquestion of the relative rate of return upon the investment will engage\r\nour attention at a later time. Examination of the years of rapid\r\nrevival after 1897 by themselves, however, especially for individual\r\ncompanies, shows striking results. This is especially true of roads,\r\nnot then developed up to a fair working capacity for their plants.\r\n\r\nAn interesting comparison with the previous decade, 1870 to 1880,\r\nexemplifies this relation still further. The gross earnings of the\r\ntrunk lines of the United States decreased very greatly per mile of\r\nline from $7,211 in fact to $6,636 during the decade; but at the same\r\ntime the net earnings steadily increased. This was due primarily to the\r\ngreat volume of business developed,--the ton mileage increasing more\r\nthan three fold during these ten years. It happened despite the fact\r\nthat the miles of line during the same period had more than doubled.\r\nThe following decade, 1880 to 1890, was represented by an increase of\r\nonly 82.7 per cent. in mileage, while the number of tons of freight\r\nhauled one mile increased by 132 per cent. Density increasing in this\r\nway, a corresponding ability to carry at a lower rate per ton was a\r\nnecessary result. So indisputably has this law--that an expanding\r\nvolume of business up to a certain point, may profitably be carried\r\nat a continually lowered cost--been proved, that it is estimated by\r\nso competent an authority as the _Engineering Review_ that, provided\r\nsufficient tonnage be available for 2,000-ton freight train loads, a\r\ncost of one mill per ton mile can be attained. Its significance may be\r\nrealized from the fact that the lowest revenue per ton mile reported\r\nfor the United States is 2.21 mills per ton mile for the long haul\r\nsoft coal business of the Chesapeake & Ohio.[58] This, of course, does\r\nnot imply that any railroad in actual operation, carrying all kinds\r\nof freight including a large proportion of local traffic, can in the\r\nimmediate future hope to attain this result. It is intended only to\r\nshow that, provided the volume of traffic be large enough, the cost of\r\noperation tends to decline as a matter of course, until a condition of\r\ncongestion for the existing plant has been reached. At this point a new\r\ncycle of costs of operation and of profits makes its appearance.\r\n\r\nThe most important single factor in the production of increasing\r\nreturns upon a railroad is the density of traffic; that is to say,\r\nthe amount of business which can be conducted with a given set of\r\nrails, terminals and rolling stock. In other words, it is the degree\r\nof effective utilization of the plant and equipment. It is too obvious\r\nto need demonstration, after what has been set forth concerning the\r\nnature of railroad expenditures, that economy of operation and,\r\nconsequently, profits are more or less directly dependent upon this\r\nfact. Such effective utilization of the property may be secured in two\r\nways: either by a large tonnage per mile of its line, or else by a\r\nconcentration of such traffic as it may have into large train loads,\r\nwhich can individually be transported at low cost. The first of these\r\neconomizes the fixed expenses for roadway and line which respond but\r\nslowly to enlargement of traffic, by distributing them thinly over a\r\nlarge tonnage; the second economizes the mere movement expenses which\r\ntend to grow less rapidly than the size of the trains. For neither\r\nfuel consumption nor wages of train crews expands _pari passu_ with\r\nthe paying load. Fortunate the lot of the railroad which enjoys both\r\nthese advantages, of density of traffic per mile of line and of tonnage\r\ncapable of such concentration in heavy train units.\r\n\r\nTraffic density--the tons of freight carried one mile per mile of\r\nline--is readily computed. The ton mileage, representing the total\r\ntransportation service, is merely divided by the number of miles of\r\nline operated. The following graded table illustrates the wide range\r\nof this figure, according to the location of different companies and\r\nthe nature of their business, as well as the change in the last few\r\nyears.[59]\r\n\r\n  ========================================================================\r\n                       |                 1902-3               |  1910\r\n                       |--------------------------------------+---------\r\n                       |           |--Percentage of tonnage-- |\r\n                       |           |--------------------------|\r\n                       |  Traffic  | Agric'l|Products| Manu-  | Traffic\r\n                       |  density  |products|of mines|factures| density\r\n  ---------------------+-----------+--------+--------+--------+---------\r\n  Rock Island Company. |   428,116 |   25   |   29   |   14   |  581,000\r\n  C.

The St. Paul system lies nearer Chicago, but is\r\nstill largely dependent upon a local and rural constituency. The Great\r\nNorthern--a great transcontinental trunk line--despite its sparsely\r\nsettled western area, exchanges a large volume of through freight for\r\nthe Pacific Coast for lumber and other bulky products carried east.\r\nThe New Haven serves perhaps the most densely settled area in the\r\nUnited States, but much of its traffic is on branch lines and is of a\r\nretail character. The Wabash lies in well settled territory and hauls\r\na heavy tonnage of low-grade freight. The last two are not only great\r\ntrunk lines to the seaboard, but also tap the coal and iron fields.\r\nMuch of their tonnage is consequently of low grade. The Pennsylvania\r\nenjoys a still further advantage, super-adding a rich local traffic in\r\nmanufactures and merchandise. As compared with its rival trunk line,\r\nthe New York Central, it hauls relatively little grain; but, on the\r\nother hand, the New York Central has a much smaller coal and iron\r\nbusiness. Some one has aptly characterized the difference between\r\nthe two roads, describing the New York Central as \"operating between\r\ngood points, but not through a good country\" so far as local business\r\nis concerned. On the one, through traffic is supplementary to local\r\nbusiness, while on the other it is the reverse. The high density of\r\ntrunk line traffic is such that about two-thirds of all the tonnage of\r\nthe United States is transported east of the Mississippi and north of\r\nthe Ohio river.\r\n\r\nTraffic density has enormously increased during the last two decades,\r\nas a result of the filling up of the country and the relative cessation\r\nof new construction. This is manifested by the growth since 1890. In\r\nthat year the density was less than 500,000 ton miles per mile of line,\r\nand during the depression of 1893 it fell well below that figure. The\r\ntotal of 1,053,000 reported for 1911 represents, therefore, more than\r\na doubling of the density in twenty years. This growth during 1898 and\r\n1905-'06 was notable. The latter period, especially, was a time when\r\ncongestion upon all the roads of the country occasioned much distress.\r\nThe fact is evident that the country has well grown up to the measure\r\nof its existing transportation facilities.\r\n\r\nThe second measure of effective operation for the production of\r\nincreasing returns, is concentration in the trainload. This is regarded\r\nby many as the supreme test of efficiency in management. Great progress\r\nhas been made during the past years in this regard in the United\r\nStates--an improvement which has largely enabled the carriers to\r\nbear up under an increasing burden of expenditure. The trainload is\r\ngenerally adopted today as the unit of operation, measuring the cost\r\nof service.[60] It is a fact that, within certain limits, the cost of\r\nhandling a train does not vary greatly with its capacity. Since the\r\nfirst application of air-brakes to freight trains in 1887, a train\r\ncrew sufficient to handle fifteen cars can care for thirty about as\r\nwell in long haul wholesale business. Fuel cost, also, as has been\r\nshown, lags well behind the rate of increase of the load. Eaton in his\r\nRailroad Operations, concludes that from thirty to fifty per cent. of\r\ncost is independent of the trainload. The effect is that any increment\r\nin the paying load very materially decreases the cost of operation per\r\nton.\r\n\r\nProgress in the United States in increasing the average train load\r\nis shown by the lowest curve on the diagram on page 97. The scale\r\napplicable is along the left hand side of the chart. From 175 tons\r\nper train in 1890 to an average figure of 383.10 in 1911 is certainly\r\na remarkable showing. The most rapid increase seems to have occurred\r\nafter 1897, with the first resumption of general prosperity. As for\r\nindividual roads, the following table of average train loads is\r\nsuggestive, as showing the gradation between roads of different type,\r\nas well as progress from year to year:\r\n\r\n   AVERAGE NUMBER OF TONS OF FREIGHT PER TRAIN (TONS PER TRAIN MILE)\r\n\r\n  ==============================================================\r\n          Road   (Fiscal Years)            | 1901 | 1905 | 1910\r\n  -----------------------------------------+------+------+------\r\n  Pennsylvania Railroad (East of Pittsburg)|  478 |  498 |  649\r\n  Pennsylvania Company (West of Pittsburg) |  382 |  420 |  511\r\n  Pennsylvania System (Both)               |  454 |  476 |  607\r\n  Chesapeake & Ohio                        |  511 |  557 |  701\r\n  Great Northern                           |  347 |  541 |  520\r\n  Erie Railroad                            |  379 |  416 |  497\r\n  New York Central & Hudson River          |  365 |  381 |  413\r\n  Northern Pacific                         |  324 |  367 |  429\r\n  Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe              |  238 |  265 |  298\r\n  Chicago & Northwestern                   |  255 |  259 |  261\r\n  New Haven                                |  208 |  222 |  293\r\n  Southern                                 |  190 |  194 |  237\r\n  ==============================================================\r\n\r\nThe great coal and iron roads, the trunk lines and the transcontinental\r\nlines all concentrate their business; while the granger roads, like\r\nthe Atchison and North Western, the roads with much local business\r\nlike the New Haven or the Southern, operating in sparsely settled\r\nregions, all have of necessity smaller trainloads. But all alike betray\r\nremarkable progress in this regard. In 1870 the average for the best\r\nroads was little above 100 tons,--such as 103 tons reported for the New\r\nYork Central and 137 tons on the Lake Shore. From this level to results\r\nof 400 or 500 tons on the average represents a notable achievement. The\r\nLake Shore for 1911 reports a revenue train load of 635 tons. It should\r\nbe observed, however, that such results come from longer trains, not,\r\napparently, so much from larger cars. To raise the average trainload on\r\nthe Wabash from 196 tons in 1890 to 386 tons in 1908 is also worthy of\r\nnote. The significance of these recent figures can be realized from the\r\nfact that the London & North Western, one of the leading railroads in\r\nGreat Britain, reports recently an average freight train load of only\r\n68 tons. This represents probably a fair average for European railroads\r\nas a whole, although in England the general practice of privately owned\r\ncars, of light locomotives, short freight sidings, etc., may reduce\r\nthe figure slightly below the continental average. Statistics not only\r\nshow the notable improvement in recent years; they at the same time\r\nshow how the trainload performance is affected by trade conditions. For\r\nnearly every road the trainloads for 1904 were distinctly lower than\r\nin the preceding years. This was a year of acute business depression.\r\nThe movement of great staple commodities, such as iron ore, coal, steel\r\nand iron and lumber, was greatly curtailed. All business was conducted\r\non a narrower basis. Smaller trainloads were an almost inevitable\r\nconsequence. The revival in the following year, however, immediately\r\nimproved the conditions of operation, as the figures indicate.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that the figures for the American roads above given\r\nrepresent averages. These are compounded from local and through traffic\r\ntaken together. It is apparent at once that local trains must average\r\nfar lighter loads than are customary upon long hauls without breaking\r\nbulk. Thus New England railroads report for 1906 an average trainload\r\nof only 220 tons, while other parts of the country, such as the North\r\nCentral group, report 426 tons of paying load. Only by separation of\r\nlocal from through business can we adequately appreciate the enormous\r\nadvances which have taken place in railroad operation in the United\r\nStates, with corresponding reductions in the cost of transportation.\r\nWhile the New York Central at one time reported an average trainload\r\nof 322 tons, the average load of its through trains on the main line\r\nrose as high as 750 tons. More than twice this figure is attained upon\r\nthe Pittsburg, Bessemer & Lake Erie road in hauling ore from the lakes\r\nto the furnaces at Pittsburg. The Illinois Central, for its low grade\r\nand long haul to the Gulf, has recently built locomotives capable of\r\nhauling 2,000 tons of net paying load. A standard grain train on the\r\nLake Shore in 1903 consisted of fifty cars holding forty tons each.\r\nEven this figure has recently been surpassed by the New York Central,\r\nwhich, with its monster new \"mogul\" engines, hauls eighty loaded 30-ton\r\ncars, giving 2,400 tons of revenue freight. The Mallet locomotives with\r\na tractive effort of 100,000 lbs., at present seem to have reached the\r\nlimit of size and weight. Seventy-five grain cars holding 1,000 bushels\r\napiece are equivalent to the production of twenty bushels per acre of\r\nan area of six square miles. This is an ordinary trainload. It is not\r\ninfrequent to transport a fifth more than this. Eighty and even one\r\nhundred cars in a train since 1900 often bring the load up to 3,600\r\nand even 4,000 tons of freight. Such a train is over four-fifths of a\r\nmile long. From these figures it certainly appears that trainloads for\r\nlong haul are standardized at not less than 2,000 tons, a figure which\r\nwould have seemed absolutely impossible to railroad managers of fifteen\r\nor twenty years ago. The maximum trainload in Germany on coal traffic,\r\nwhich, of course, greatly exceeds any general average for trains of all\r\nclasses, is about five hundred tons. It has been regarded as a notable\r\nachievement that this represents an increase of about one hundred tons\r\nin the last decade.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the extravagant promises of economy from large\r\ntrainloads have been considerably abated of late. It has been\r\neffectively demonstrated that there is a limit to such growth. Only\r\nlow-grade and long haul carload traffic can profitably be concentrated.\r\nIn 1903, for instance, a general decrease in trainloads followed a\r\nreduction in the relative amounts of low as compared with high grade\r\ntonnage. Less iron, coal, and raw materials and more merchandise and\r\nmanufactures offered for carriage, necessitated a positive reduction\r\nin the trainloads as already mentioned. Nor can local business in\r\nless than carload lots profitably be concentrated beyond a certain\r\npoint. Grades must be uniform to attain such economy. The trainload\r\nmust not exceed the traction power on the heaviest inclines, or else\r\nexpensive pusher engines or breaking up of trains will offset all other\r\nsavings. Moreover, too great trainloads even on the best roadbeds\r\ninvolve slower speeds. Not only is other traffic thus impeded, but\r\nthe economy in wages vanishes after a certain point with such slower\r\nmovement. The fashion had been set by James J. Hill, the master mind\r\nin the transcontinental field. His notable results, due to a careful\r\nworking out of every detail, led to a frenzied imitation on all sides.\r\nMany roads then discovered to their loss that while they had provided\r\nrolling stock for heavy loading, ampler terminals, longer sidings\r\nand heavier bridges also were a necessary accompaniment. Part of the\r\ncongestion of traffic in 1906-1907, already mentioned, and a portion\r\nof the financial embarrassments of recent years, were undoubtedly due\r\nto too great haste in seeking economies of this sort in rolling stock,\r\nwithout at the same time making provisions for enlargement of other\r\nportions of the plant. A more discriminating policy has consequently\r\nresulted of late. Traffic is being sorted according to its availability\r\nfor concentration. The best utilization of the rails and terminals is\r\nbeing more considered. Business demands for quick delivery also enter\r\ninto the calculation. Instead of a few huge slow-moving leviathans\r\nblocking other trains, the line may perhaps better be kept full of many\r\nsmaller trains moving more nearly together. Such are certain of the\r\ndetails now being worked out. None of them, however, weaken the main\r\nproposition that a discriminating concentration of traffic conduces\r\nvery greatly to economy of operation.\r\n\r\nThis concentration of traffic units is largely due to technical\r\nimprovements of various kinds. Foremost among these has been the\r\ndevelopment of the steel rail. In 1880 more than seven-tenths of our\r\nmileage was still equipped with iron rails. Rapid progress ensued\r\nduring the next ten years, upward of eighty per cent. being in\r\nsteel rails by 1890. At the present time, the proportion is above\r\nninety-eight per cent. In fact, no iron rails have been made for many\r\nyears, except for repairs and on insignificant branch lines in remote\r\nparts of the country. A steady increase in the weight of the rails has\r\nensued. The standard rail for main lines until the Civil War weighed\r\nfifty-six pounds to the yard. In the seventies this was increased to\r\nsixty-three and above; in the latter eighties the best practice was to\r\nuse seventy-five pound sections. Since 1900, they frequently run as\r\nhigh as one hundred pounds, in regions of dense traffic. Few main lines\r\nof track now average less than seventy-five pounds. It is this increase\r\nin the use and size of steel rails which has permitted improvements in\r\nrolling stock. But, on the other hand, grave dissatisfaction with the\r\nquality of the rails manufactured of late years, particularly since\r\nthe establishment of practical monopoly under the United States Steel\r\nCorporation has become manifest. Numerous accidents due to breakage\r\nof rails, especially since 1905, have revealed either defects in\r\nmanufacture or an undue load imposed by heavier rolling stock, too\r\nhigh speed, or both. The matter has become steadily worse. In 1902 the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission ascribed seventy-eight accidents to\r\nbroken rails. Nine years later the number had risen to 249. The need\r\nof improvement is now fully recognized on all sides.\r\n\r\nThe power and efficiency of locomotives has increased, perhaps, more\r\nsince 1890, and particularly since 1895, than in any previous period.\r\nSuperior materials particularly have contributed to this result, such\r\nas the substitution of cast steel for cast iron and of nickel steel for\r\nwrought iron in axles, crank pins, etc. Some of the improvements which\r\nmay be mentioned are, for instance, an increase in the average heating\r\nsurface from 2,000 in 1890 to nearly 3,000 square feet at the present\r\ntime, and an increase in the average steam pressure from 160 pounds\r\nto 210 pounds per square inch in the same period. The maximum weight\r\nhas also increased very rapidly. The average weight of a locomotive\r\nat the close of the Civil War was approximately 90,000 pounds. This\r\nhas increased in somewhat the following proportions: To 1881, 102,000\r\nlbs.; to 1893, 135,000 lbs.; to 1895, 148,000 lbs.; to 1898, 230,000\r\nlbs.; rising in 1900 to 250,000 lbs. Passenger locomotives since 1892\r\nhave almost doubled in weight, and freight engines have more than done\r\nso. Compound and double or Mallet locomotives are also supplanting\r\nthose of simpler type for peculiarly heavy service. The first compound\r\nengine was built in 1899, only one being constructed in that year. In\r\n1900 a single locomotive works turned out 500--a number constituting\r\ntwo-thirds of the entire output of that company--for use in the United\r\nStates. Such locomotives cost more in first instance; but the greater\r\nweight and steam capacity, together with the considerable saving in\r\nfuel, amounting to perhaps twenty per cent., more than offset this\r\nobjection. The traction efficiency of these improved locomotives may be\r\nshown by the statement that in 1885 the decapod Baldwin locomotives,\r\nmade to haul 3,600 tons on a level, represented the maximum capacity.\r\nFive years later the same company built locomotives to haul 4,000 tons,\r\nnot only on a level, but on any ordinary grade. As indicative of late\r\nadvances in locomotive construction, we may instance those built about\r\n1900 for the Illinois Central and the Union Railroad at Pittsburg,\r\nboth low-grade roads, carrying exceedingly heavy train loads. The\r\nfirst of these weighed, including its tender, 365,000 lbs., the Union\r\nRailroad consolidation engines weighing 334,000 lbs. Such locomotives\r\nare stated to be twice as powerful as the best which were manufactured\r\ntwenty-five years ago. This record is surpassed by engines which have\r\njust been built for pusher service on the soft-coal Virginian Railway.\r\nThey are of the Mallet type, weighing 540,000 pounds; with a train\r\ncapacity of 4,230 tons. The evaporative surface is 6,760 square feet.\r\nAs summarizing the increased efficiency of American locomotives, we may\r\ninstance the figures of the Interstate Commerce Commission, showing\r\nthe average performance of locomotives for the United States. Whereas\r\nin 1894 the average number of tons of freight carried per locomotive\r\nwas about 32,000 tons, this rose to 46,000 tons in 1899, and to 54,600\r\ntons in 1906. At the same time the number of tons of freight hauled one\r\nmile for each freight locomotive in the United States increased from\r\n4,000,000 in 1894 to approximately 6,000,000 in 1899, and to 7,300,000\r\nin 1910. In other words, the average performance of each freight\r\nlocomotive in the United States has increased by more than fifty per\r\ncent. in the last decade.\r\n\r\nThe economy of large freight cars has been amply demonstrated. Marked\r\nadvances in the average capacity have taken place in the last few\r\nyears. In the sixties a 15,000 pound freight car represented about\r\nthe normal capacity. This has increased, as measured by maximum load,\r\nto 28,000 pounds in 1873; to 40,000 pounds in 1875; to 60,000 pounds\r\nin 1885; to 70,000 pounds in 1895; while at the present time 80,000\r\nto 100,000 pound cars are in everyday use. Cars of this latter type,\r\nbuilt to carry forty to fifty tons, are necessarily of pressed steel\r\nconstruction, and are mainly useful for the carriage of coal and\r\nore and similar low-grade commodities. It seems to be questionable\r\nwhether a maximum capacity has not been about reached, in view of\r\nthe exceedingly great wear and tear imposed upon track, bridges, etc.\r\nUp to this point the economy of heavy loading is indisputably proved.\r\nIncreased size of cars far more than proportionately increases the\r\npaying load. Thus, for instance, an 18,000-pound car will carry 20,000\r\npounds load, while a 22,000-pound car will carry a load twice as great.\r\nIt is stated on good authority, for example, that a car of forty tons\r\ncapacity can be built which will weigh but 3,000 pounds more than a\r\nthirty-ton car, and cost hardly fifty dollars more. This is undoubtedly\r\nthe reason why at the present time the average load per car is at least\r\none hundred per cent. greater than the maximum which was possible\r\ntwenty years ago.\r\n\r\nA steady increase in the freight performance of American equipment\r\nis shown by official data of the Interstate Commerce Commission.\r\nWhereas in 1894 it required on an average 1,888 freight cars for every\r\n1,000,000 tons of freight transported their capacity has so increased\r\nthat the same amount of traffic in 1906 was carried by only 1,127 cars.\r\nIn other words, an enormous increase in the freight service had been\r\nattained. On the other hand, the actual mileage performance of much of\r\nthis equipment is extraordinarily low. It averages only about 9,000\r\nmiles annually or an equivalent of thirty miles a day. At a speed of\r\nfifteen miles an hour, this means that actual movement under a paying\r\nload, allowing for one-third of its journeyings empty, occupies but\r\nlittle over an hour and a quarter a day. The actual performance is,\r\nhowever, not quite as poor as appears. For, of course, this average\r\nincludes the non-movement of all cars in bad order (sometimes one-tenth\r\nof the total); and also all idle equipment. This latter consideration\r\nis of great moment. Special cars, suitable only for seasonal business;\r\nand especially demurrage delays, often forty-eight hours or more,\r\nadversely affect the result. Where separate mileage records of\r\n\"foreign\" cars are kept, as on the Wabash system, it appears that\r\ntheir mileage is twice as high as for \"home\" cars. The difference is\r\ndue to the fact that cars off their own rails, mainly are in actual\r\ndemand and are kept moving. Probably the daily performance of loaded\r\ncars is not less than 150 miles. But a journey of this length, with two\r\ndays' delay at each end at terminals, would bring the average down to\r\nabout thirty miles. The public does not always appreciate these facts;\r\nand is often querulous. It is certain that the problem how to secure\r\ngreater efficiency in the use of this equipment is as yet imperfectly\r\nsolved.[61]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Revenue and Cost Per Train Mile.]\r\n\r\nThe discussion of the nature of railroad expenditure may be concluded\r\nby a comparison of the net effects of the developments of the last few\r\nyears; that is to say, of steadily expanding costs of operation and of\r\nslowly and tardily rising rates chargeable for service on the one hand,\r\nas over against the results obtained by mechanical improvements and\r\nincreasing economy of operation coupled with growth of tonnage, on the\r\nother. The average cost of transportation has greatly increased. This,\r\naccording to the statistics of the Interstate Commerce Commission, is\r\nshown upon the diagram herewith by the middle curve.[62] The average\r\ncost of running all trains per mile, which had fallen from 96 cents\r\nin 1891 to 91.8 cents in 1895, rose to $1.07 in 1900, and in 1911\r\nincreased by more than one-third, to $1.54 per mile. Against this\r\nshould be set the fact that while the trains thus cost more to haul per\r\nmile, their paying load has increased in somewhat smaller proportion.\r\nThis is shown by the upper curve on the diagram above mentioned.\r\nFor freight trains the increase has been from $1.65 to $2.89 per\r\nmile. Passenger revenues per train mile have increased less rapidly.\r\nThis follows from the well-known fact that freight rates have been\r\nincreased, while passenger rates have not changed for the better during\r\nthis period; and also that economies in concentration of traffic are\r\nnecessarily confined to the carriage of freight. The immense gain in\r\ntrainloads has probably been the main element, among these, as already\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nAmong other things this diagram also brings out the effect upon\r\nrevenue of the substantial rate increases after 1900, coupled with the\r\nelimination of rebate losses. It will be observed how sharply the upper\r\ncurve of revenue per train mile slants upward after 1899, by comparison\r\nwith the lower line denoting cost. The same thing apparently occurs\r\nagain after the set-back of 1907.\r\n\r\nThe interrelation between these various factors may be more readily\r\nshown by confining our attention to the period during which a\r\npractically uninterrupted development of business ensued, thus\r\neliminating the confusion due to the four years of depression\r\nafter 1893. The data on our various charts for the years 1898-1906\r\ndemonstrate that during this period the ton mileage, measuring the\r\nfreight traffic handled, has practically doubled. To transport this\r\ndoubled tonnage, a growth in freight train mileage of only eighteen\r\nper cent. was necessary. This was due, of course, to the notable\r\nconcentration of train loading, already described, as well as to a\r\ndensity of traffic per mile of line almost sixty per cent. greater. As\r\na consequence of these economies in operation, the revenue per freight\r\ntrain mile has increased by about fifty per cent.; while the average\r\ncost of running all trains per mile has grown less rapidly, namely, by\r\n42 per cent. Had we data for freight trains alone it would surely be\r\nlower than this. In the meantime during this period of eight years, the\r\nrate of return in revenue per ton mile received, remained practically\r\nunchanged.[63] From all of which it would appear that even despite all\r\nthese confusing factors, the law of increasing returns, so far at least\r\nas 1898-'06 was concerned, was making itself appreciably felt.\r\n\r\nAttentive consideration of the available figures, especially as shown\r\nby diagram on page 97, shows apparently that the various economies in\r\noperation, heavier trainloads and the like, have not since 1906 yielded\r\nany greater profit from mere operation, with the ever increasing volume\r\nof business. In other words, the increase in the margin between cost\r\nof operation and revenue per train mile,--measuring profitableness\r\nper unit of movement--has not kept pace with the augmentation of the\r\nsize of that unit,--the trainload. Thus it follows, as one would\r\nexpect, even making allowance for all changes in rates, wages and\r\nother expenses, that the law of increasing returns as applied to\r\nrailroads, does not arise primarily from economic considerations\r\nas to mere physical operation. The law originates primarily in the\r\nfiscal conditions attaching to the heavy capital investment,--the\r\nfact, namely, that fixed charges up to a given point of saturation\r\ntend to remain constant, absolutely; but become proportionately\r\nless, therefore, as the volume of business expands. From this fact,\r\ntherefore, rather than because of any marked economies of large-scale\r\nproduction, may it be affirmed that railroads offer a notable example\r\nof the law of increasing returns. The important bearing of this\r\ndistinction will appear in due time in connection with the problem of\r\nthe determination of reasonable rates. Added significance, also, is\r\ngiven to the relation between the cost of new capital, measured by the\r\nrates of interest on bonds and dividends on stocks, and the supply\r\nnecessary to provide adequate extensions and improvements in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Appendix_:\r\n\r\nThe subjoined chart, reproduced by the _Railway Age Gazette_ from a\r\nbulletin of the Bureau of Railway Economics, brings out forcibly the\r\nmanner in which, within the short time limits of full utilization\r\nof plant, a large increase of business can take place without a\r\ncommensurate growth of expenses. The phenomenon for railroads is of\r\ncourse cyclical. Annually, as here indicated for 1911, the second\r\nhalf of the year is marked by a much heavier movement of traffic,\r\nprincipally, of course, the crops. But expenses never rise in\r\nproportion. This is most evident for the eastern group of roads, as\r\nhere shown. This causes the net revenue curve, also, to vary much more\r\nthan in proportion to the volume of traffic, in consequence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Monthly Revenues and Expenses per Mile of Line from 1911\r\nand 1912.]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[50] Illustrated by the seasonal variation of business. _Vide_ appendix\r\nto this chapter at p. 100.\r\n\r\n[51] Webb, Economics of Railway Construction; originally in\r\nWellington's Economic Theory of the Location of Railways.\r\n\r\n[52] Webb, _op. cit._; originally from Wellington.\r\n\r\n[53] _Wall Street Journal_, March 25, 1908.\r\n\r\n[54] Eaton, Railroad Operations, etc., pp. 44-58.\r\n\r\n[55] Investigation in 12th Ann.

The process must be tentative and experimental. Little\r\ncan be calculated in advance. Tariffs are not made out of hand; they\r\ngrow. Not until a rate has been put into effect, can its results be\r\nknown. The lower limit of charges, however, is more or less fixed.\r\nObviously the rate must not be less than that portion of the variable\r\nexpenses incident to each particular unit of business. This variable\r\nexpense is divisible into two parts, one for loading and unloading,\r\nand the other for actual movement. The first step in constructing a\r\ntariff, therefore, is to separate these two portions of the variable\r\noutgo. General experience fixes the terminal outlay for loading and\r\nunloading at an average figure of about twenty or twenty-five cents per\r\nton at each end of the line; that is to say, at an average of about two\r\nand one-half cents per hundred pounds as the total terminal cost.[64]\r\nJust where, above or below this average, the figure for any particular\r\ntariff will lie, depends upon a multitude of details.\r\n\r\nThis terminal expense is obviously quite independent of the length of\r\nthe haul. It costs no more to load for a carriage of 3,000 miles than\r\nfor one between two adjoining stations. It is the second portion of\r\nthe specific costs, namely, the movement expense, which varies with\r\nthe distance. This movement cost is more difficult of determination,\r\nas affected by a multitude of variable factors, such as the grades,\r\ncurvature, number of stops, the size of train load, and above all,\r\nthe volume of the traffic. Assuming the simplest physical conditions,\r\none would expect the movement expense, aside from the initial cost\r\nof getting up steam in order to move at all, to rise proportionately\r\nto the distance traversed. Graphically represented, the tariff would\r\nappear somewhat as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Relation of Cost of Carriage to Distance.]\r\n\r\nIn this diagram the distances of carriage are represented along the\r\nhorizontal line, A B; while the rate charged is laid off vertically.\r\nThe distances A C and E B represent the constant terminal cost; while\r\nthe steadily rising rates with increasing distance, due to movement\r\nexpenses, are shown by the sloping dotted line C D. This chart at\r\nonce demonstrates why under the very simplest physical conditions a\r\nstraight mileage tariff is unscientific and unreasonable. For the\r\nconstant terminal expense, spread evenly over the mileage traversed\r\nas the movement expenses grow, becomes progressively less and less\r\nin proportion to the total of the two, which constitutes the real\r\nrate. The longer the haul, the lower the ton-mile cost as a matter of\r\nnecessity. As Chanute calculated on the New York Central a generation\r\nago,[65] while the average cost per mile of hauling a ton ten miles\r\nwas 4.062 cents, it descended progressively to less than one cent per\r\nmile for distances over five hundred miles. A common rule is that\r\nthe rate rises as the square root of the distance, rather than in\r\nproportion to it. A hundred-mile haul represents a cost approximately\r\nonly twice as great as one of twenty-five miles, instead of being four\r\ntimes as much. For thrice a given cost the haul may be increased nine\r\ntimes. The course of such a tariff with increasing distance would be\r\nrepresented by the parabolic curved lines on the preceding diagram.[66]\r\nThe particular curve would depend upon the commodity and local physical\r\nconditions. In territory where movement expenses were heavy or\r\noperation difficult, the curve would obviously rise more rapidly. Such\r\na mathematical tariff does not depart widely from the one traced by\r\nthe heavy dotted line C D first described. The progressive decline of\r\nthe per mile rate with increasing distance may be illustrated by the\r\nrough estimate of allowing two and one-half cents per hundred weight or\r\nfifty cents per ton for terminal cost, with one-half cent additional\r\nper mile for movement expenses. For a ten-mile haul this would cost\r\nfifty-five cents, or an average of 5.5 cents per mile. Were the\r\ndistance 500 miles, the average cost would be only (50+250)/500 cents\r\nor 0.6 cents per ton mile.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of Belgian Tariff Sheets.]\r\n\r\nThus far the problem has been seemingly simple. The next step\r\nintroduces new complications. Our hypothetical railway line at a point\r\none hundred miles out, may cross a navigable river or canal, or may\r\nintersect another railway. Engineering considerations of absolute cost\r\nof operation now no longer predominate. Relative costs by rival lines\r\nenter into the case. Water lines or more direct railways compete for\r\nthe traffic. One cannot even fall back upon the cost of carriage by\r\nany of these lines, either the weaker or the stronger. An entirely\r\nnew principle comes into play. The alternative is presented of taking\r\nthe business at a rate lower than, and out of line with, rates on\r\ngeneral traffic, rather than to lose it to another line. At first\r\nsight it would appear that it were better to abandon the traffic than\r\nto take it for less than a fair average return or profit. This is a\r\nserious matter. The tonnage offered is large. The existence of active\r\ncompetition for it, is proof of its importance. Railways meet at large\r\ntowns, and large towns become larger because the roads meet there. The\r\nmain reason for not abandoning the traffic, however, arises from that\r\nprimary fact, to which one constantly recurs, that all expenses are not\r\nalike in their nature. A concrete example will make this plain.\r\n\r\nSuppose, for instance, the normal rate to yield a fair average return,\r\nall expenses considered, be thirty cents per hundredweight. Two-thirds\r\nof the cost of this, or twenty cents, would not cease as outgo, were\r\nthis business abandoned. The rails would rust, the ties would rot, and\r\ntrains would move but with lighter loads, and the fixed charges would\r\nstill go on inexorably night and day. Ten cents per hundredweight will\r\nmeet the variable and extra cost incident to this particular business.\r\nA fifteen-cent rate would at least repay these extra outlays. It\r\nwould do more. It would contribute five cents per hundred pounds to\r\nthe twenty cents outgo per hundredweight, which, without the traffic,\r\nwould have to be borne _in toto_. Even a rate of eleven cents would\r\ncontribute something to this end. For it would leave a surplus of one\r\ncent per hundredweight to lighten the other burden. Adopting Hadley's\r\nphraseology,[67] if you take at eleven cents, freight that costs you\r\nthirty cents to handle, you lose nineteen cents on every hundredweight.\r\nIf you refuse to take it at that rate, you lose twenty cents on every\r\nhundredweight you do _not_ carry. For your constant expenses go on,\r\nwhile the other road gets the business. There is only one course open.\r\nThe rate at the competitive point must be cut; if not to make a profit,\r\nat least to stop a greater loss. And one comfort may be uncovered in\r\nso doing. The lowered rate may so stimulate new business and enlarge\r\nthe volume of traffic, that it may be handled at much lower cost. In\r\nfact, this consideration alone in absence of all competition, may\r\ninduce a lowering of rates at certain points out of line with the\r\ngeneral schedule. This incentive, conditioned by the fact of increasing\r\nreturns, is always in the background. The destiny of many places is\r\nmanifested in terms beyond the control of the carrier. Soil may be\r\npoor, climate or population adverse to progress. But some particular\r\nplaces enjoy peculiar advantages for growth. Not to stimulate new\r\nbusiness at these points where traffic might be cultivated, even\r\nwithout rivals in the field, is little better than allowing it to\r\nescape over a competitor's line of rails, were they present.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Effect of Competition at Certain Places on Rates.]\r\n\r\nCutting the normal rate at competitive points or at important points\r\nin order to stimulate traffic, in conformity with the principle above\r\nstated, transforms our tariff diagram as shown herewith. The rate\r\nrises steadily with the increasing distance from A, except at E and F.\r\nAt these points it is fixed at a lower point, determined not primarily\r\nby the cost of service at all, but by the available demand for it.\r\nTraffic at these points is charged what it will bear; not as much but\r\nas little as it will bear: which, being translated, means that the\r\ncharge is set as high as possible, still holding the volume of business\r\nconstant, or even increasing it if that can be accomplished. The total\r\nprofit is constituted of the profit per unit of freight multiplied into\r\nits volume. The centre of interest is here shifted from the average\r\nprofit per unit considered alone, to the total profit thus obtained.\r\nAt this point another difficulty presents itself. Although, as set\r\nforth elsewhere, local discrimination,--charging a lower rate for\r\na more distant point,--may sometimes not only be not injurious but\r\nactually beneficial to all parties concerned, it is the exception, not\r\nthe rule.[68] Ordinarily to accord a remote point a lower rate without\r\npatent cause, is an economic anomaly, and, moreover, a political\r\nblunder. It violates the democratic principle of cost of service as\r\nunderlying rate schedules. Most legislative bodies have prohibited it\r\nby law. The United States and most of the American commonwealths do not\r\npermit it, other than in exceptional cases. The result is that on our\r\nhypothetical tariff, the rates from A to points intermediate between A\r\nand B and B and D must be cut to the levels, E and F, fixed for those\r\nlatter places. Such was the action taken by the trunk lines in 1887 in\r\nconformity with the requirements of the long and short haul clause of\r\nthe Federal Act to Regulate Commerce. An original progressively rising\r\ntariff is thus at once transformed to a series of level grades or\r\nplatforms, the shifts of level corresponding to the location of large\r\ntowns or competitive centres; and the grade of each platform being\r\nfixed by the rate determined under competition at those points.[69]\r\nThis ascending series of grades may be most irregular, as conditioned\r\nby local circumstances. The general steepness of the gradation is low\r\non eastern roads like the New York Central, with a large volume of\r\ntraffic and easy operating conditions. On western lines like the Denver\r\nand Rio Grande, in rugged territory, with a sparse population and light\r\ntonnage, the per mile rate rises rapidly and the gradation of the\r\ngeneral tariff is steep. But always it will be found that the changes\r\nin rates occur at competitive points, with transition to a new level of\r\nrates determined by the conditions at the next competitive point beyond.\r\n\r\nAn important fact concerning this tariff thus far developed, is that,\r\nof course, the height of the upper level at the most remote point must\r\nnever exceed what the particular traffic will bear. In other words,\r\nsupposing that the traffic consist of grain or coal, not more than a\r\ncertain amount could ever be charged, no matter how great the distance,\r\nwithout so far diminishing the profit in the transaction as to render\r\nthe business impossible. This is shown by the diagram opposite the next\r\npage, whereon it appears that each commodity, coal, wheat, cement,\r\nlumber, or oil, having attained a certain level of rates, never rises\r\nthereafter, no matter what the distance. Each attains the maximum of\r\nwhat it will bear. That level it can never exceed. This immediately\r\nleads to another consideration. No single tariff is applicable to\r\nany large number of commodities. Each one must be regarded as a law\r\nunto itself. Not only does the ultimate amount which each is able to\r\nbear depend upon the value of that commodity, but also the conditions\r\ndetermining competition with respect to it must be different all along\r\nthe line.[70]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RATES BETWEEN CHICAGO AND ST. PAUL. DISTANCES IN MILES\r\nFROM CHICAGO.\r\n\r\nRATES IN CENTS PER 100 LBS.\r\n\r\n[_Facing page 108_]]\r\n\r\nThus it appears that the height of the extreme upper level in our\r\ndiagrammatic series of rates is fixed by the highest charge which that\r\nparticular traffic will bear.[71] Beyond a certain point, no matter\r\nhow great the distance, the rate cannot be increased above this level.\r\nThis maximum varies, of course, with each commodity. On cotton it may\r\nbe fifty-five cents per one hundred pounds; on grain or coal it will\r\nbe much lower, and on sand or cement lower still. The problem of the\r\ntraffic manager is to attain this highest rate as speedily as possible\r\nwith increasing distance, and to grade his rates with distance up\r\nto this level as quickly as possible, consistent, of course, with\r\nmaintenance of a full volume of business. But not only may the final\r\nlimit of what the traffic will bear be different for each commodity;\r\nthe steps or stages by which the rate progresses up to this maximum,\r\nare quite independently determined. The actual tariffs of local class\r\nrates in general are much simpler than the commercial conditions of\r\nrate making often warrant. Probably the major portion of tonnage on\r\nAmerican railways moves under special or commodity rates. Even in\r\nPrussia over three-fifths of the traffic is of this exceptional sort.\r\nThese special rates are made with a view to particular circumstances\r\nprevalent at the time. Bids from a quarryman in Vermont on stone for\r\na public building in Chicago, may be dependent upon the grant of a\r\nlow rate on his marble in competition with a quarry in North Carolina,\r\nalso able to supply the particular stone required. The various\r\nascending series of rates are thus rendered bewilderingly complex.\r\nThis is also shown by the foregoing diagram of rates between St. Paul\r\nand Chicago.[72] The rate on a cheap, heavy commodity like coal,\r\nprobably rises rapidly at first, and soon attains a maximum beyond\r\nwhich it can never go. On this diagram, for instance, the freight rate\r\non soft coal for points up to 180 miles out is lower than that on\r\nflour. Beyond that point the coal rate in turn exceeds that on flour.\r\nCement is higher than lumber for the first 150 miles; but after that\r\npoint the relatively greater value of lumber holds it steadily above\r\ncement. On heavy cheap commodities the relatively high cost of cartage\r\nin competition enables the railway to reap the full measure of its\r\nadvantage and to charge well up to the maximum of what the traffic\r\nwill bear, within a comfortably short distance. Furthermore, variable\r\ncosts for terminal charges have to be considered. Wherever they are\r\nhigh the rate must rise at once sufficiently to cover these, no matter\r\nhow short the distance; but thereafter the rate may not need to be\r\nincreased greatly for some time. On light higher-grade goods the wagon\r\nis an effective competitor for longer distances.[73] Moreover, the\r\ncompetitive points at which rates rise from stage to stage are seldom\r\nthe same for all classes of goods. A river crossing brings competition\r\nfor coal, lime, or cement, but does not affect the rates chargeable on\r\nhigh-class freight which seldom goes by water in any event. A railway\r\nspecially interested in the development of some particular industry,\r\nwherever it crosses our hypothetical line, effectively holds down\r\nthe rate on the product of that business. Junction points with other\r\nrailways having no such interest may have no influence upon that rate,\r\nbut may cause modifications in other directions. Another railway being\r\nin need of back loads over its line, as the result of a predominant\r\nmovement, let us say, of beef cattle at certain seasons of the year,\r\nmay introduce competition in all the tonnage capable of being carried\r\non cattle cars. Such a road holds down the rates on this traffic\r\nwherever it happens to cross, but has no effect upon any other rate.\r\nThus it comes about in practice, as the last diagram well illustrates,\r\nthat the tariff lines cross and recross one another, generally rising\r\nwith increasing distance, but at all sorts of different times and\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nFew generalizations are possible in this connection. Rate making\r\nmust in a growing country ever be a matter of infinite detail. It is\r\ngenerally true, however, that beyond a certain point the tariff on\r\ndifferent grades of commodities will separate more and more widely\r\nwith increasing distance. For, obviously, after the low-grade goods\r\nhave reached the maximum which they can bear--and this they tend to do\r\nspeedily--they must remain practically constant; while those of higher\r\ngrade continue progressively rising. And for very short distances\r\nthe rate on the low-grade goods may even exceed that imposed upon\r\nhigher-class tonnage. The coal rate for a ten-mile haul may exceed that\r\nupon some commodity worth twice as much; but for a 200-mile haul the\r\ncoal rate may be only one-eighth of the rate on the other goods. Long\r\nexperience on the part of the carriers has, however, enabled them to\r\narrange their tonnage in classes; for each of which the conditions are\r\nmore or less uniform. By reserving the exceptional traffic for special\r\ntreatment under commodity rates, a fairly consistent scheme of charges,\r\nrising by stages with increasing distance may be evolved.\r\n\r\nFew standard railway tariffs in the United States develop beyond the\r\npoint covered by the preceding paragraph. Many of them are unable even\r\nto reach this stage of logical growth. In the South, for instance, they\r\nhave never got beyond the stage of progressively rising local rates,\r\nwith independent and often radically reduced charges at all large towns\r\nor competitive points.[74] Each traffic manager, particularly since\r\nthe effective prohibition of working agreements between competing lines\r\nby the Trans-Missouri Freight Association decision of the Supreme Court\r\nin 1896, has been left to work out his own salvation, not aided by, but\r\nin spite of, the efforts of his rivals. There is, nevertheless, one\r\nexample of further development in the so-called trunk line territory,\r\nlying east of the Mississippi and north of the Ohio and Potomac rivers.\r\nConditions here, in general, are most favorable by comparison with the\r\nWest and South. Both population and traffic are dense, and the state\r\nlegislatures are conservative in making grants for the construction\r\nof new lines. The companies are historically mature. The good fruits\r\nof coöperation had already appeared in the evolution of a scientific\r\nand logical scheme, long before such coöperative action had been\r\nfrowned upon by the law and the courts. All the railways in trunk line\r\nterritory have worked in harmony, so far as general classified local\r\ntariffs are concerned--however much they may have fought one another\r\nover differentials to seaboard cities, or export and import rates.\r\nTheir system is comparatively simple in principle, although it has\r\nrequired the experience of many years to work out in detail. Fully\r\ndescribed elsewhere,[75] it will suffice for present purposes to say\r\nthat all rates from intermediate points between Chicago and New York,\r\nare fixed at a definite proportion of the Chicago-New York rate both\r\nfor east-and westbound shipments. Thus, for instance, as shown by the\r\nmap of trunk line rate distribution, at page 365, the rate from Detroit\r\nto New York is seventy-two per cent. of the Chicago-New York rate.\r\nThe percentages from the following points are as indicated, namely:\r\nCincinnati, eighty-seven per cent.; Indianapolis, ninety-three per\r\ncent.; Grand Rapids, ninety-six per cent.; Peoria, Ill., one hundred\r\nand ten per cent.; Louisville, Ky., one hundred per cent.; Milwaukee,\r\none hundred per cent.; and even points in Canada, such as Toronto,\r\nseventy-eight per cent., etc. Every place, no matter how small, has\r\na certain percentage of the New York-Chicago rate assigned to it.\r\nThis rate changes with any variation of the standard or basic charge.\r\nThus when the Chicago-New York rate, first-class, is seventy-five\r\ncents, the rate from Indianapolis is ninety-three per cent. of that\r\nfigure. Any change of Chicago-New York first-class rates modifies\r\nevery intermediate rate in exactly the same proportion. This was well\r\nexemplified in the rate wars of 1893. These percentages have been\r\nfixed after a long process of compromise among conflicting interests.\r\nAnother point of special interest is that these rates are adjusted on\r\nthe basis strictly of the long and short haul principle, namely, that\r\nall intermediate points enjoy a somewhat lower rate than the terminal\r\npoints, although the percentage may not be exactly upon a mileage\r\nbasis. Consideration of the distribution of these percentages points\r\nto many apparent inequalities in the adjustment; but, as a matter of\r\nfact, it will be found that the existence of competing routes, of water\r\ntransportation or of other factors, offers a partial explanation in\r\nmost instances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSuch being the general character of this comprehensive trunk line\r\nsystem, the relation of it to the tariffs described heretofore is not\r\ndifficult to demonstrate. Each separate railway having developed a\r\nwell-ordered rate schedule, they have all met and agreed upon a unified\r\nscheme; which as far as possible harmonizes all conflicting interests.\r\nThe gradation of rates rising with increasing distance from New York\r\non each separate road, is adjusted to the corresponding gradation of\r\nrates of its neighbors on either side. The result is a series of rate\r\nzones, lying more or less concentrically about the terminal point.\r\nThese zones are highly irregular in width and area, but possess one\r\nfeature in common. Each remoter zone is one stage higher in rates than\r\nits predecessor. This relationship is indicated by the cross section\r\ndiagram herewith. This cross section, of course, differs from the\r\ndiagrams heretofore shown. It is purely geographical, being taken, not\r\nalong one single railway but as the crow flies--straight across the\r\nwhole trunk line territory. But in order to appreciate the significance\r\nof this elaborate scheme, one should imagine a whole series of such\r\nprogressively rising rates, radiating out along the different lines\r\nof railway. Connecting the corresponding levels or stages upon each\r\none with those of its neighbors, the concentric zones are immediately\r\noutlined. The advantage of such a broad scheme is that it generalizes\r\nthe single line tariff; taking into view every place, no matter how\r\nsmall and irrespective of its location whether upon a through line or\r\nmerely a local transverse one. Every town, no matter how insignificant,\r\nis assigned a place in a logically evolved plan. Such would seem to\r\nbe the ideal of rate construction, toward which all traffic managers\r\nshould strive.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe foregoing description of the development of a mileage tariff is\r\napplicable to only a part of the traffic. A very large volume of\r\ntonnage,--said to be not less than seventy-five per cent. in America,\r\nsixty-three per cent. in Prussia and fifty per cent. in the United\r\nKingdom,--moves under special rates made in quite another way in\r\nresponse to the exigencies of commercial competition. The making of\r\nthese freight rates in practice is an extremely complicated matter.\r\nNo single road is independent of rates made by its rivals--rates\r\napplicable not only to competing commodities and markets, but also as\r\naffected by apparently the most remote and disconnected contingencies.\r\nThus railway rates, as has well been said, are not a set of independent\r\nthreads; they form a fabric. They are so interwoven everywhere that if\r\none thread be shortened, it will cause a kink in the fabric that may\r\nrun almost anywhere. In order to understand this it will be necessary\r\nto describe somewhat in detail the nature of competition as applied\r\nto transportation; and then to show by a few concrete illustrations,\r\nthe various factors which actively enter into the determination of\r\nspecific rates. Laymen and legislators do not sufficiently appreciate\r\nthe extremely delicate nature of the work. Much discussion relative\r\nto railway competition seems to be based upon the assumption that it\r\nconsists in the main of the competition of railway lines more or less\r\nparallel or else operating under substantially like conditions. As a\r\nmatter of fact competition in transportation is to a large degree far\r\nmore complex.\r\n\r\nRailway competition is of three entirely distinct sorts. These may\r\nbe denominated, respectively, competition of routes, competition\r\nin facilities and competition of markets.[76] The first of these,\r\ncompetition of routes, as the name suggests, is limited to the\r\nactivities of the carriers alone. It occurs whenever two railways\r\nare exposed to identical commercial conditions both at the point of\r\norigin and of destination. The rivalry is direct and physical. The only\r\ncompetition possible is that concerning the route by which traffic\r\nmay move between those two points. Such competition is most likely to\r\narise between more or less parallel lines, as for instance between the\r\nvarious trunk roads from New York to Chicago. The classic instances\r\nin our history are of the rate wars due to the West Shore and the\r\nNickel Plate, which were built for the express purpose of engendering\r\ncompetition with the then existing lines,--the New York Central and the\r\nLake Shore, respectively. The same sort of simple competition prevails,\r\nof course, between a railway and a parallel canal or other waterway,\r\nas, for instance, between the Erie canal and the trunk lines, or the\r\nIllinois Central and the Mississippi river. Such simple competition as\r\nthis, where confined to railways alone, almost inevitably leads to one\r\nof two results: the roads may remain independent, preventing ruinous\r\nrate wars by pooling; or else, as a result of long continued cut-throat\r\ncompetition, the bankrupt road may be bought up and merged with the\r\nsolvent one. This was the fate of the old New York and New England\r\nrailway, finally purchased by the New Haven system; of the West Shore\r\nand Nickel Plate lines; and of the Kansas Pacific, unloaded on the\r\nUnion Pacific by Jay Gould. The nature of railway competition is indeed\r\nsuch that no other result than consolidation or pooling can ensue.\r\nWeyl is right in his observation that,--\"Strictly speaking, permanent\r\ncompetition can exist, not between railroads struggling for the same\r\ntraffic; but solely between those railroads which have no territory in\r\ncommon.\"\r\n\r\nThis first form of competition of routes or, as it has been called, of\r\nalternative routes, often obtains where conditions of competition are\r\nmore obscure than in these simple instances above named. In the rivalry\r\nfor the imported plate glass or crockery traffic between the trunk\r\nlines and the Gulf roads, the competition is none the less of routes\r\nbetween Liverpool and Chicago, although the water carriage by way of\r\nNew Orleans or Galveston is so much more roundabout. Freight actually\r\nmoves from Boston to Chicago by a line 1786 miles long, via Asheville,\r\nN. C., while the direct distance is only 1004 miles.[77] From St. Louis\r\nto Meridian, Miss., is 512 miles by direct rail line; yet traffic\r\nmay move over 2000 miles going to New York and then around.[78] The\r\nmap on p. 271, showing the various rail and water lines concerned in\r\ntraffic between New York and the little town of Troy, Ala., shows\r\nhow widespread are the ramifications of competition of this sort.\r\nManifold instances of such roundabout carriage have been elsewhere\r\ndescribed in full.[79] They differ from the competition of parallel\r\nroutes, however, in the important regard that absorption of the long\r\nlines by the short ones becomes both physically and financially\r\nimpossible. Whenever a large area like the Pacific slope is devoid\r\nof manufactures, and wherever the source of supplies is sufficiently\r\nconcentrated, as, for instance, in the manufacture of agricultural\r\nimplements which are almost exclusively made in or about Chicago, we\r\nstill have to do with a clear case of competition of routes, although\r\na great number of carriers may participate in the business. When\r\nmolasses or rice are only to be had from New Orleans, the centre of\r\nsuch business, the carriers to all tributary consuming points compete\r\nfor the routing of it over their own respective lines. These carriers\r\nmay operate either by land or sea or by a combination of both; and\r\nthey may transport commodities by the most roundabout ways.[80] The\r\ndeterminant feature, however, distinguishing this class of competition\r\nis neither the mode or carriage nor its length; but is found in the\r\nfact that the commercial conditions at both ends of the line, points\r\nof origin and destination, are identical for each participant in the\r\nbusiness. Direct competition of routes, therefore, has to do with pure\r\ntransportation,--the creation of place values,--and this being the\r\ncase, the relative cost of service is always a factor of moment.\r\n\r\nCompetition of facilities, the second of the three phases of railway\r\ncompetition above mentioned, deals, as its name implies, not at\r\nall with the rates charged but with the facilities or conveniences\r\nafforded. Such competition is confined solely to rivalry for\r\nbusiness at the established rates. Immediately on the appearance\r\nof any departure from these conditions the question becomes one\r\nof competition of either of the other two sorts. An instance of\r\ncompetition of facilities would be the introduction of reclining\r\nchairs or of a superior service in passenger business. When the Rock\r\nIsland system offered such facilities without an extra charge, it\r\nbecame necessary at once for others to meet this competition in the\r\nsame way that they would meet a reduction of rates. Any reduction in\r\ntime of transit for freight business between two given points without\r\nextra charge, would in the same manner give rise to competition\r\nof facilities. Such facilities, however, as might have a distinct\r\nmoney value, as, for instance, free storage, cartage, demurrage or\r\nmilling-in-transit, any one of which practically amounts to giving\r\nvalue without charge, are, of course, equivalent to a reduction of the\r\nrate; and do not belong in this class of considerations at all. Only\r\nthose conveniences or facilities, which, while attempting to secure\r\nbusiness may not be compounded for money, should be classified in this\r\ngroup. It should also be observed that competition of facilities may as\r\nreadily arise between parts of the same railway system or under pooling\r\nagreements to maintain rates, as between distinct and independent\r\ncompanies.[81] And such competition between parent and child often\r\narises. Thus, for instance, business was as actively solicited as ever\r\nby the Pennsylvania and the Baltimore & Ohio in competition during the\r\nseveral years of financial control of one by the other prior to 1907.\r\nThe New Haven railway may compete with its own water lines around Cape\r\nCod or on Long Island Sound. But in all of these instances the cardinal\r\nfeature to note is that the competition is always at the established\r\nrate. For New England, although the New Haven system and the Boston\r\nand Maine do not compete on rates at their points of contact, there\r\nis constant rivalry in respect of facilities or service. The same\r\nthing is undoubtedly true of the Atchison and the Southern Pacific\r\nin the carriage of California fruits. Although operated under pooling\r\nagreements, yet they were competitors in the matter of the service\r\noffered. Each sought an enlarged volume of tonnage, but not by cutting\r\nthe agreed rate.\r\n\r\nThe third form of competition in transportation is dependent upon\r\nthe competition of markets; and is not in reality direct competition\r\nbetween carriers at all. This is the most difficult of all forms to\r\nunderstand.[82] It is certainly in many cases more than a \"euphemism\r\nfor railway policy.\"[83] Yet although indirect and often obscure,\r\nit is of fundamental and conclusive importance in the determination\r\nof freight rates. Commercial competition deals not with a mere\r\nchoice of routes, but with alternative markets. The carriers act,\r\nnot independently and of their own volition, but only as agents or\r\nrepresentatives for their constituents, the shippers. They may become\r\ntools or weapons in the hands of merchants or manufacturers who are\r\nthe real contestants. It is largely in this sense that it is so often\r\nalleged, and rightfully, that railway traffic managers oftentimes do\r\nnot _make_ rates at all. Their energies are bent to the analysis of\r\nthose circumstances by which their rates are made for them.\r\n\r\nThe production or preparation of commodities for final consumption\r\nfalls naturally into two distinct parts; the creation of form value,\r\nsucceeded by the conferring of place value. Transportation is concerned\r\nalone with the latter process. Of these two operations, the latter,\r\nthe creation of place values, is by far the more elastic and adaptable\r\nprocess. The grower, the miner or the manufacturer has his first costs\r\nmore or less rigidly fixed by natural or human conditions; such as the\r\nfertility of the soil, the grade of ore, the prevailing scale of wages,\r\nand so on. His proximity to the status of a marginal producer depends\r\nupon his relative position in these respects. With the carrier, matters\r\nare more contingent. Including within its reach, as it does, many\r\ngrades of producers and consumers, each more or less rigidly held bound\r\nby his own circumstances and conditions, as above said, the carrier is\r\nable to exercise a wide range of choice in fixing that margin of value\r\ncreated which it reserves for itself. And at all times, by reason of\r\nthe factors set forth elsewhere, primarily its subjection to the law\r\nof increasing returns, this intermediate share of the carrier tends to\r\nadjust or accommodate itself to the end that it may discover or produce\r\na wider margin between values in the hands of producer and consumer,\r\nrespectively. This may be best accomplished by a progressive widening\r\nof its field of activities, that is to say, by an enlargement of its\r\nphysical reach and scope. It is always striving to lower the cost of\r\nproduction made by the marginal producer. Its motto must ever be, to\r\nget more business, if not right at home by search for it abroad--and\r\nthis always with the chance that the greater the distance between the\r\nproducer and the consumer, the greater the possible margin of place\r\nvalue remaining as its individual share.\r\n\r\nThis ever-present incentive to widen the market carries with it a\r\ndirect consequence. A market is a commercial area characterized by a\r\nprevalent equality of prices. Phenomenal development in this respect is\r\ncharacteristic of the United States. For many commodities the market\r\nis coextensive with the national domain. It is the chosen function of\r\ntransportation agents, by rail and water, to ensure this result; to\r\npreserve an equality of prices, despite the variety of producing and\r\nconsuming conditions. The railway is the agent by which the market is\r\nthus widened and rivalries are thus equalized. In railway parlance\r\nthis is what is known as \"keeping everyone in business.\" The following\r\nquotation from the Senate Committee Hearings of 1905 adequately\r\ndescribes the process: \"I am interested in the erection of a mill\r\nthat has just been completed, and sometime since I was figuring on\r\nthe question of a smokestack. I wanted to have that stack built out\r\nof brick that is burned in New Jersey, and that is several hundred\r\nmiles away. It is a long way to ship freight from New Jersey to North\r\nCarolina. A quotation was made me by the stack builder, whose office\r\nis in New York, and I remarked to him, 'That price is prohibitive; I\r\ncannot pay that price for that stack.' He said, 'That is the best I\r\ncan do; but if you will tell me what you can afford to pay for that\r\nstack, in competition with home-burned brick, I will see what I can do\r\nwith the railway people.' He said, 'All right; I will take it up with\r\nthe railway people.' His quotation included the delivery of the brick\r\nand the erection of the stack at my plant. It would require something\r\nlike about fifty carloads of brick to build that stack. Within a week\r\nhe had his price revised, and gave me a satisfactory quotation and\r\ntook my contract for the stack. Of course he had to get a special rate\r\nfrom the railway people, because there is no regular tariff on brick\r\nfrom New Jersey to North Carolina.\" In this instance the railways\r\nactually created this new business by so adjusting the margin between\r\nthe minimum cost of making brick in New York and in North Carolina,\r\nas to make it possible for the traffic to move. The special rate here\r\nmentioned, however, should be carefully distinguished from a secret\r\nrebate offered to one contractor as against another in the same place.\r\nThis commodity rate, while special to meet a particular contingency,\r\nwas open to any other shipper similarly circumstanced. The student\r\ncannot too carefully discriminate between these two sorts of special\r\nrates. They are constantly confused in the public mind. The effect of\r\nthese open commodity rates, is not to create difference of opportunity\r\nbetween individuals, but to generalize economic conditions and equalize\r\nprices throughout wide areas.\r\n\r\nThe most satisfactory way to describe commercial competition as applied\r\nto carriers is by concrete illustrations. There are two distinct\r\nvarieties or degrees of it, which may be denominated primary and\r\nsecondary. These might as properly, perhaps, be called simple and\r\ncomplex, or direct and indirect. Of these, the first concerns those\r\ncases wherein a commodity undergoes no physical transformation between\r\nproducer and consumer. Shipments are usually direct. Only one rate is\r\ninvolved. Shall St. Louis and the South, for example, be supplied with\r\nsalt from the Kansas or Michigan fields?[84] This is a case of pure\r\ntransportation,--the creation of place value, alone. The Aroostook\r\nfarmers of Maine compete in prices with the potato growers of Michigan\r\nin the New York market. Each district is usually represented by a\r\nrailway, dependent upon the prosperity of its particular constituency.\r\nCompetition of markets is usually more keen where a number of\r\ncarriers are concerned, each representing its own clients; but it\r\nmay conceivably arise as between several markets served by the same\r\ncompany, especially with the growth of great railway systems. The\r\nSouthern Pacific must insure a rate from California on oranges to\r\neastern markets, as compared with the rates over the southern roads\r\nfrom Florida, sufficiently low to warrant the venture of capital in the\r\nindustry.[85] Marble from the quarries of Vermont and North Carolina,\r\nand paving blocks from the Lithonia district in Georgia and from\r\nWisconsin or South Dakota, must meet in Chicago on even terms. Such\r\ncompetition, although simple and direct, recognizes no national bounds.\r\nCopper from Montana must be laid down in Liverpool at rates to permit\r\nof meeting the price on Chili bars from South America. Our entire grain\r\nand cotton crops must be transported at rates which will enable them\r\nto hold their own in European markets. The California raisin has, in\r\nthis manner, had to make its way into Eastern markets in the United\r\nStates against the pressure of importations from Spain, as described\r\nin another place.[86] The cotton mills in New England and in the\r\nSouth must have their output carried to China under conditions which\r\nwill enable them to meet the price made by the British manufacturer.\r\nThis last instance, however, introduces us to the second form of\r\ncompetition; inasmuch as a double transportation is involved first from\r\nthe fields to the mill, and thereafter from the mill to the consumer.\r\n\r\nSecondary or indirect forms of commercial competition in\r\ntransportation, concerning, as has been said, not one but two distinct\r\ncarriages of entirely different goods, needs to be in turn subdivided\r\nstill further. The products of agriculture and mines afford the best\r\ninstances. The lumber business is peculiarly suggestive in this\r\nconnection, owing to the fact that in the United States a vast treeless\r\narea in the Middle West is surrounded with forest tracts available\r\nfor development. The market again in this case is limited only by our\r\nnational frontier. Omaha is supplied with yellow pine and cypress from\r\nLouisiana after a 1,200-mile haul; Oregon fir brought 1,800 miles in\r\neach instance for fifty cents per hundred pounds; and with Michigan\r\nhemlock and pine transported less than 500 miles for eleven and a half\r\ncents. These various sorts of lumber are all more or less competitive.\r\nAnd in each case the final cost of laying down the product in Omaha is\r\ndetermined; first, by the rate from the stump to the mill, and then,\r\nas sawed lumber, thence on to destination. The Eau Claire, Wisconsin,\r\nlumber case[87] before the Interstate Commerce Commission, fully\r\ndescribes the intricacies of adjustment needed to hold a number of\r\nsuch producers on a parity. In this instance Eau Claire, \"next the\r\nstump,\" as an important lumbering centre was shown to be declining in\r\nimportance relatively to Mississippi river towns, which received their\r\nlogs by raft down stream. A differential of a few cents was threatening\r\nthe welfare of a considerable population. The Wichita, Kansas, cases\r\nare suggestive in a similar way.[88] Sugar is laid down at this market\r\nfrom every point of the compass. From Hawaii it is shipped in the\r\nraw state to San Francisco, and then brought East, like the Oregon\r\nlumber, cheaply, as a back-load to counter-balance westbound shipments\r\nof grain and manufactures. From New Orleans refineries comes the\r\nLouisiana product, and from the Atlantic sea ports the Cuban sugar; but\r\nin each case the carriage is broken at an intermediate point, at which\r\nmanufacture or jobbing ensues. A large class of operations analogous to\r\nthis, known as \"milling in transit\" and \"floating cotton,\" elsewhere\r\ndescribed in detail, involve the same complexity and interrelation of\r\nrates.[89] The point to carry forward is that commercial competition\r\ndemands that in every case not single rates but the sums of all the\r\nconnecting rates for each competing person or region shall be properly\r\nadjusted. If this be not done, some one will be excluded from the\r\nmarket and \"put out of business.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time in our ascending scale of complexities, it will be\r\nobserved that manufacture now begins to outweigh mere transportation\r\nin importance. With low-grade products, like salt or sugar, the\r\nincrement of value due to transportation is relatively high as\r\ncompared with manufacturing costs. As the grade of product rises,\r\nhowever, the differences in value and in form between the raw and the\r\nfinished product, render the problem of location of the manufacture\r\nmore difficult as affected by the relative adjustment of rates of\r\ntransportation for the two. According to the data of the Federal Bureau\r\nof Corporations, the cost of refining crude petroleum, worth three to\r\nfour cents a gallon at the wells in Pennsylvania, should not exceed\r\none-half cent a gallon. This sum would barely pay for the first hundred\r\nmiles of its carriage by rail, as ordinarily shipped. The market is,\r\nof course, extraordinarily extensive; hence the persistent flagrancy\r\nof the practices of secret rebating by the Standard Oil Co.[90] To\r\nobtain such special favors in transportation outweighed in importance\r\nthe incentive to introduce economies in production. In this industry,\r\nwhere little waste occurs in manufacture, the refineries may well be\r\nlocated at the consumers' door. The manufacture of furniture for the\r\nPacific states, on the other hand, must be located \"next the stump,\" in\r\nNorth Carolina or New England. The long carriage must be applied, not\r\nto the bulky lumber but to the finished product. The freight rate on\r\nlumber from Oregon to Pittsburg is just about equal to the value of the\r\nlogs at the mill. Obviously, the large proportion of waste or common\r\nlumber will not bear a high addition to its cost by carriage to any\r\ndistance. In the manufacture of fur hats a shrinkage of weight occurs\r\nof one-half between the fur scraps and the finished product. In such\r\na case it is imperative, either that the factory be near the source\r\nof supply or that the rate on the two distinct commodities be nicely\r\nadjusted. The decision of the United States Steel Corporation to build\r\na large plant at Duluth for supplying the northwestern market is the\r\noutcome of such considerations. The main point is that the adjustment\r\nof a number of rates may determine, not only the general welfare of the\r\nindustry but even its specific geographical location with reference to\r\nthe raw material on the one side and the market on the other.\r\n\r\nThe jobbing or wholesale business of the United States exemplifies the\r\nmost highly involved and complex details of commercial competition.[91]\r\nIn this field it appears most clearly that, as is so often alleged,\r\nrailway traffic managers hold the welfare of entire communities, as it\r\nwere, in the palms of their hands. In all the cases heretofore cited,\r\ngreat natural forces outweighed the purely personal and human ones.\r\nSoil, climate and mineral resources more or less completely determined\r\nthe final outcome of commercial competition. But the distributive\r\nbusiness of a country is more largely artificial. It is more subject\r\nto human control, and may be influenced by personal considerations.\r\nShall the economically dependent southern planter be supplied with\r\nmanufactures of all sorts,--from harnesses to tin dippers--from\r\nmid-western cities like Cincinnati and Chicago or from eastern centres,\r\nsuch as New York and Baltimore? This is the underlying economic issue\r\nraised in the notable Cincinnati Freight Bureau Case in 1894; in the\r\ncourse of whose determination the Supreme Court of the United States\r\nraised the more immediate and pressing question of the authority of the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission to regulate rates at all. In the dust\r\nraised by the controversy over this purely legal question, the basic\r\neconomic dispute was lost to view.[92] Shall the people of the Pacific\r\nslope be supplied with hardware and analogous products from their own\r\nlarge cities which buy at wholesale from the East, break bulk at San\r\nFrancisco or Seattle and ship out to smaller towns in less than carload\r\nlots; or shall the distribution take place at the hands of jobbing\r\nhouses located several thousand miles away at Chicago or St. Louis?\r\nThis is the economic dispute raised in the St. Louis Business Men's\r\nLeague case.[93] The very existence of San Francisco as a commercial\r\ncentre may depend upon it. For the primary and secondary operations of\r\ncommerce are often complementary. At the large cities, concentration\r\nof raw staples moving inward naturally entails back loads outward at\r\nlow rates for manufactured goods distributed by jobbers. Or, taking\r\nthe smaller places, the farmer will of necessity buy his cotton cloth,\r\nsugar and coal in the town to which he drives by wagon to deliver his\r\ncotton, corn or wheat.[94]\r\n\r\nThe entire puzzling class of cases dealing with the southern basing\r\npoint system are primarily concerned with such issues as these.[95]\r\nThree distinct classes of cases arise. There is, first, the competition\r\nbetween cities of equal size, be they large or small, such as Memphis,\r\nTenn., and Little Rock, Ark.; Danville, Va., and Lynchburg; or\r\nCleveland, and Cincinnati, Ohio: secondly, the rivalries between large\r\ncities and what may be called secondary local centres in the same part\r\nof the country,--such as Seattle, Wash., _v._ Spokane; Chicago _v._\r\nBurlington or Dubuque, Iowa; or Atlanta, Ga., _v._ Macon: and thirdly,\r\nthe intense rivalries between the great first-class cities, like New\r\nYork, Philadelphia, and Chicago, and the rest of the field, big and\r\nlittle.[96] The mail order houses, the express business and the parcels\r\npost intervene at this point. But in all of these issues, series of no\r\nless than three separate transportation costs have to be totalized and\r\nkept more or less on a parity. The intricacy is increased by reason\r\nof the fact that shipments must be made, first at wholesale to the\r\njobbers, and thereafter usually in less-than-carload lots to retailers.\r\nIf the carload rate be relatively too low, with reference to the rate\r\non small lots, the jobbers near the market will be upbuilt and the\r\njobbers at a distance cannot compete. If the opposite relation obtains,\r\nthe jobber in a distant great city will be able to ship out small\r\norders cheaper than the local dealer can obtain them by carload and,\r\nbreaking bulk, peddle them from his own town. So narrow is the margin\r\nof profit on staple goods that a difference of a fraction of a cent per\r\npound may exclude a dealer from the field entirely. This question of\r\ncarload ratings is, however, treated elsewhere; impinging, as it does\r\nupon matters of freight classifications.[97]\r\n\r\nThe rivalries of jobbers and middlemen in different cities are\r\ninevitably borne into the offices of traffic managers. Were all\r\nrailways equally interested in all cities alike, the matter need not\r\ngo further, engendering railway rivalries. But such is seldom the\r\ncase. Hardly a road can be named, whose interests are not more or less\r\nidentified with some particular city. Commercial rivalry thus at once\r\nleads to railway competition. Four or five railways, like the Chicago\r\nand Northwestern, radiate out to the west from Chicago, and have no\r\ninterest in St. Louis. Almost as many, like the Missouri Pacific, go\r\nout from St. Louis without entering Chicago. Others, like the old Union\r\nPacific and, formerly, the Atchison system, only come to the Missouri\r\nriver, and consequently wish to upbuild their eastern termini, Omaha\r\nor Kansas City. Only a few, like the Illinois Central, reach them\r\nall. Such a road is usually called upon to act as a mediator in all\r\ndisputes. \"It is a continual struggle between the line from Kansas City\r\nto St. Louis with no interest in Chicago, and the line from Kansas\r\nCity to Chicago with no interest in St. Louis,\" as one witness before\r\nthe Industrial Commission phrases it. Compromise is the only outcome.\r\nAnd in this manner an involved structure of differentials is built\r\nup, oftentimes top heavy and always susceptible of collapse on the\r\ndefection of any party to the agreement. When a truce was patched up\r\nbetween the trunk lines and the Gulf roads after the sugar rate war of\r\n1905, it is said to have taken twenty experts three entire days merely\r\nto \"line up\" rates on a parity between the competing jobbing centres.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe simplest compromise in any dispute over rates between competing\r\ncentres is the concession of absolute equality or, as it is called, of\r\nflat rates between all points irrespective of distance. This shifts\r\nthe burden from the carriers and places competition entirely upon\r\nthe shoulders of the merchants. Oddly enough, also, this result of\r\nequal rates regardless of distance between various competing centres,\r\nespecially when they are secondary distributing or concentrating points\r\nrather than original sources of traffic, may sometimes evolve naturally\r\nout of commercial conditions imposed by tariffs built up upon the\r\nbasis of distance. The accompanying theoretical diagram, based upon\r\nactual traffic conditions prevalent in Missouri river territory, serves\r\nto illustrate the way in which, under certain circumstances, such\r\nequalization of rates may take place. Two groups of cities are here\r\nrepresented as though lying respectively along two river valleys north\r\nof their separation at a point G. Let us call them the Mississippi\r\nand the Missouri for purposes of identification. The starting point\r\nis equality of rates from such a distant point as New York (O) to\r\nall places along the Mississippi from A to G. Such equality properly\r\narises in theory from the substantially equal distance from New York.\r\nIn practice also, under the trunk line rate system,[98] such equality\r\nprevails, inasmuch as the rates from New York to such a series of\r\nMississippi river crossings is fixed at 125 per cent. of the rate from\r\nNew York to Chicago. By a similar course of reasoning, namely, the\r\napproximately equal distance from New York (O), rates from that place\r\nto a second series of points along the Missouri river should be and are\r\nin effect made equal. From these two facts it logically follows that\r\nthe balances of the rates from all points on the Mississippi river out\r\nalong an extension of their lines from New York toward the west should\r\nalso be equal. This is obviously in conformity with the mathematical\r\nprinciple that equals subtracted from equals leave equal balances.\r\nThus the rates B X, D Y and F Z are compelled to equality. From this\r\nrelationship in turn follows still another. All rates from any point on\r\nthe inner series of towns to any point whatsoever on the outer western\r\nseries of places along the Missouri river must remain equal regardless\r\nof distance. For each line from New York to A, B, C, D, etc., wishes,\r\nof course, to participate in business not only on the direct extension\r\nof its own line, but to as many other points as possible.[99] Without\r\nsome agreement, however, it would normally enjoy traffic only on the\r\ndirect extension of its own line. The point Y would most naturally be\r\nreached by way of C, D or E, over the shortest routes. Competitors on\r\neither side would similarly enjoy an advantage in more direct lines\r\nfrom New York to the places immediately beyond them. Thus for business\r\nfrom New York to Z, the more direct lines through E, F or G would\r\nobviously have an advantage over lines which passed around through A,\r\nB, C or D. An almost irresistible incentive to cut-throat competition\r\nwould exist. The only way the lines east of the inner circle can\r\npeaceably partition business to the outermost western points is by an\r\nagreement to make all rates between the inner and outer circles the\r\nsame. In this manner the rates from A to Z or from G to X are reduced\r\nto an equality with the rates offered by the shortest route between the\r\ntwo rivers, which, in this case, is E Z. The rate for this shortest\r\nline then becomes the basic one, upon which all the others depend.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Traffic Conditions in Missouri River Territory]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing economic reasoning underlies the actual tariff system\r\nprevailing in what is known as Missouri river territory.[100] Two\r\ngreat streams separating at St. Louis form the eastern and western\r\nboundaries of Missouri and Iowa. All along the two edges of these\r\nstates are located important river cities, each of which has more or\r\nless direct communication with every other crossing on the other river,\r\nover a complicated system of interlaced lines. There are no physical\r\nbarriers, the country being plain and open. The starting point and\r\nbasis of the whole scheme is the shortest direct distance between the\r\ntwo nearest points, namely Hannibal on the Mississippi, and St. Joseph\r\nand Kansas City on the Missouri. The situation is shown by the map\r\nherewith. At these points the two rivers are approximately two hundred\r\nmiles apart. For this distance the base rate of sixty cents per hundred\r\npounds, first class, is fixed by common agreement. Were local business\r\nonly to be considered, and were the railways not competing, the rate\r\nbetween other points on the two rivers at greater distances apart,\r\nsuch as for instance, Burlington on the Mississippi and Omaha on the\r\nMissouri, might be determined on a relative distance basis, as in trunk\r\nline territory. But the commercial fact is that a large proportion\r\nof the business between all these points consists of long-distance\r\ntraffic from the eastern seaboard which may cross the Mississippi at\r\nany one of these gateways between Dubuque and St. Louis on its way to\r\nthe cities on the Missouri river. All of these through long-distance\r\nshipments must, of course, enjoy the same competitive rate to the\r\nultimate western destination on the Missouri river. And, inasmuch as\r\nthe rate from the east to the Mississippi crossings is everywhere the\r\nsame, namely 125 per cent. of the New York-Chicago rate, it follows\r\nthat the balance of the rate from these points on to the Missouri river\r\nacross Iowa and Missouri, irrespective of distance, must likewise be\r\nthe same. In other words, the rates between all these Mississippi and\r\nMissouri river points must be equalized, irrespective of the length\r\nof the intervening route, whether it be two hundred miles by the\r\nshortest direct line from Hannibal to Kansas City across Missouri,\r\nthree hundred and fifty miles from Burlington to Omaha across Iowa,\r\nor even seven hundred miles by the roundabout line of the Illinois\r\nCentral skirting both states. In brief, every railway which touches\r\nboth rivers, however circuitous its route, is compelled to quote the\r\nsame rate from every point on the Mississippi river to every other\r\npoint on the Missouri. This rate must be the one fixed, as already\r\ndescribed, for the shortest direct line, namely sixty cents per hundred\r\npounds first class. Furthermore, in precisely the same way that these\r\nrates to Missouri river points from the eastern seaboard are built up\r\nand equalized, the rates from Chicago to the same Missouri river points\r\nmust be kept even. The rate through from any one of the long chain of\r\nMississippi gateways must be the same irrespective of distance. This\r\nfigure, by common agreement, has for many years been twenty cents per\r\nhundred pounds higher than the rate across Illinois to the Mississippi\r\nriver gateways from Chicago alone. The dominant note of this whole\r\ntariff is equalization of rates between all points in competition with\r\none another over all possible routes. Freight thus moves freely in\r\nevery direction and all markets are held on an absolute parity.[101]\r\nIt is one of the most remarkable features of American commercial\r\norganization, this practical elimination of the element of distance\r\nfrom interstate trade over wide areas.\r\n\r\nThe possible evil lurking in too widespread an acceptance of the\r\nprinciple of the flat rate is clearly apparent in the reasoning of the\r\nEau Claire, Wisconsin, lumber case.[102] This town complained of the\r\ndisability under which it labored in shipping lumber to Missouri river\r\npoints by comparison with other places round about. It appeared in the\r\nevidence that as early as 1884, under arbitration, all the rates from\r\ncompeting centres had been adjusted on the basis of differentials;\r\nand that, as interpreted by the carriers, the purpose of these\r\ndifferentials was to even up the differences between competing towns;\r\nto the end that all manufacturers should be put upon an equality in\r\nthe consuming territory. But this necessarily involved the practice\r\nof penalizing or nullifying in a way the advantages of location. \"If\r\nEau Claire could produce lumber cheaper than Winona or La Crosse, then\r\nthe latter points were to have a lower rate in order to enable them to\r\ncompete.\" This practice the Interstate Commerce Commission condemned at\r\nthat time; and it has consistently adhered to the precedent then laid\r\ndown. Obviously, any other general course of action would be analogous\r\nto hobbling the fleetest horse in a race to bring him down to the rate\r\nof progress of the slowest laggard. The principle of the handicap\r\napplied within moderate limits makes for an exciting athletic contest;\r\nbut if it be overdone, it eliminates all interest from the contest\r\nwhatever. The race becomes one, not of skill or endurance in running,\r\nbut of securing a sufficiently liberal handicap. Competition to be of\r\nadvantage in the way of progress must always have in view the survival\r\nof the fittest and the elimination of the unfit.\r\n\r\nThe vast extent of the United States, the necessity of transporting\r\ncommodities great distances at low cost and the progressiveness of\r\nrailway managers, has led to an extraordinary development of the phase\r\nof rate making above-mentioned. The principle of the flat rate, based\r\nupon the theory that distance is a quite subordinate, if not indeed\r\nentirely negligible, element in the construction of freight tariffs\r\nunder circumstances of competition, was fully accepted twenty-five\r\nyears ago.[103] J. C. Stubbs, traffic manager of the Harriman lines,\r\nspeaking of transcontinental business in 1898, clearly expressed it as\r\n\"the traditional policy of the American lines as between themselves to\r\nrecognize and to practise equality of rates as the only reasonable and\r\njust rule ... regardless of the characteristics of their respective\r\nlines, whether equal in length or widely different.\" It is the theory\r\nupon which the southern basing-point system is founded; and it is the\r\ncommon practice in making rates into and out of New England--being\r\nin fact vital to the continued prosperity of this out-of-the-way\r\nterritory.[104] President Tuttle, of the Boston & Maine, has most\r\nably supported this principle of equality of rates irrespective of\r\ndistance. \"It is the duty of transportation agents,\" he says, \"to so\r\nadjust their freight tariffs that, regardless of distance, producers\r\nand consumers in every part of this country shall, to the fullest\r\nextent possible, have equal access to the markets of all parts of this\r\ncountry and of the world, a result wholly impossible of attainment if\r\nfreight rates must be constructed upon the scientific principle of\r\ntons and miles.\" This is the principle of the blanket rate attacked in\r\nthe famous Milk Producers' Protective Association case in 1897;[105]\r\nand it is the practice which has been so fully discussed of late, as\r\ngenerally applied to lumber rates from the various forest regions of\r\nthe United States into the treeless tract of the Middle West. The\r\nprinciple, while applied thus generally in the construction of tariffs,\r\nis of far greater applicability in the making of special or commodity\r\nrates. Wool rates afford one of the best examples. Under such rates\r\nthe bulk of the tonnage of American railways is at present moved. The\r\nessential principle of such special rates, constituting exceptions\r\nto the classified tariffs, is that of the flat rate; namely, a rate\r\nfixed in accordance with what the traffic will bear, without regard\r\nto the element of cost, that is to say, of distance. But a noticeable\r\ntrend away from the flat rate is evident in recent decisions of the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission; especially in the Intermountain\r\ncase,[106] revision of the wool and cattle rates,[107] and the general\r\ndisposition to lessen special tariffs all along the line.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe intricacy of freight rate adjustment in response to the subtleties\r\nof commercial competition depends only in small measure upon the\r\nabsolute freight rate imposed. The main problem is really that of\r\nrelativity. But this does not mean mere relativity as between directly\r\ncompeting commodities or places. A strict relativity based upon\r\ncommercial conditions must often obtain as well between the rates on\r\nraw materials and their own finished products; between all the various\r\nby-products in an industry; and, of course, always as between goods\r\ncapable of substitution one for another. A few illustrations will serve\r\nto make these details clear.\r\n\r\nThe matter of properly correlating the freight rate on raw materials\r\nand the finished products made from them, is more far-reaching than it\r\nseems. The location and development of manufacturing depends upon it.\r\nThe country may be broadly divided into agricultural and manufacturing\r\nsections. The first of these is ambitious to develop its resources;\r\nnot only to feed, but to clothe itself and make other provision for\r\nits needs. No sooner does it seek to develop local manufacturing than\r\nit finds itself exposed to competition from the older established\r\nmanufacturers at a distance. Sometimes, even, these remote\r\nmanufacturers draw their supplies of raw material from its own fields\r\nand forests. These supplies are then shipped long distances as raw\r\nmaterial; manufactured and thereafter returned to sell in competition\r\nwith the local product. The local market in relatively undeveloped\r\nareas is probably insufficient to provide support for manufactures on\r\na profitable scale. It is essential to dispose of the surplus product\r\nover a wider area. Thus there arise two classes of manufacturers: one\r\n\"next the stump,\" manufacturing at the source of the raw material and\r\ndesiring to ship the finished product; the other, remote perhaps from\r\nsupplies of raw material, but favored by long experience, by abundant\r\nsupplies of capital and of skilled labor and by other advantages.[108]\r\nNeither class of shippers can prosper without overflowing into the\r\ndomain of the other. The outcome of this competition depends in part\r\nupon the policy of the carriers. If the rate on the raw material be\r\nrelatively low, the remote manufacturer is aided. Cotton mills and shoe\r\nfactories in New England prosper in competition with establishments\r\nin the South or the Middle West. If, on the other hand, the rate\r\non raw materials be inordinately high, while at the same time low\r\non outward-bound shipment of manufactures from the seat of the raw\r\nmaterials, the tendency is in favor of the upbuilding of manufactures,\r\nnot near the historic centres of population and consumption, but\r\nnear the sources of natural wealth, which are the potential homes of\r\nmanufacturing.\r\n\r\nThe long-standing controversy over relative rates on wheat and flour\r\nfor export affords an interesting illustration of the difficulties of\r\nproperly correlating charges of this sort.[109] Originally the rates on\r\nwheat and flour--the raw material and the manufactured product--were\r\nthe same. In 1890 the railways leading to the Gulf ports began to\r\ndiscriminate by giving lower rates on wheat, but the trunk lines until\r\n1899 held to the original equality between the two. Finally, however,\r\nthe struggle between the trunk lines and the Gulf roads for business\r\nforced the former to lower their rates on wheat, leaving the flour\r\nrates--not subject to Gulf competition--undisturbed. At times the rate\r\non wheat for export was as much as nine cents per hundred pounds lower\r\nthan the rate on flour. Thus the rate on wheat for export from the\r\nMississippi river to the seaboard was frequently twelve cents, while\r\nthe rate on wheat from the same points to Chicago added to the rate on\r\nflour there manufactured and sent on in barrels or bags to New York,\r\nwas twenty-two cents--a clear discrimination against the domestic\r\nmanufacturer in this instance of ten cents per hundred pounds. For\r\nhis American-made flour, sent abroad in competition with flour made\r\nin Liverpool from American wheat, would evidently cost that much more\r\nat delivery. In other words, wheat could be transported to England\r\nand there ground much cheaper than it could be ground here and then\r\nshipped. This bore with particular severity upon small millers, partly\r\nbecause their costs of manufacture were relatively high, and also\r\nbecause any limitation of export business forced the large millers to\r\nbid more keenly for local domestic trade. Inasmuch as a fair margin\r\nof profit to the American manufacturer would not exceed two cents\r\nper hundredweight, it is apparent that this discrimination operated\r\nseverely against the American miller. Minneapolis fortunately was\r\nunaffected by this discrimination, much of its exports going out by\r\nCanadian lines to the Lakes. The carriers defended this difference in\r\nrates on the ground of water competition by the Lakes or combined rail\r\nand water routes, which were alone open to wheat, and which thereby\r\nunduly lowered the rate on that commodity; and also on the basis of the\r\nlower cost of service in moving the raw material as compared with the\r\nfinished product. It is apparent that issue was really raised in such a\r\ncase between the interests of the farmer and of the manufacturer. The\r\nUnited States, producing a surplus of wheat the price of which is made\r\non the Liverpool market in competition with the world, is compelled to\r\nfind an outlet for this product. It is obvious that any reduction of\r\nthe freight rate--the prices in Liverpool remaining fixed--would inure\r\nto the benefit of the farmer, who would thereby receive a higher price\r\nfor his product. Viewed in this way the railways by discriminating\r\nin favor of the rate on wheat were helping the farmers. But, at the\r\nsame time, by moving this wheat more cheaply than flour the railways\r\nwere encouraging the location of flour milling abroad and rendering it\r\nimpossible to manufacture flour for export at a profit in the cities\r\nof the Middle West. In these export cases it does not appear clearly\r\nwhy the rate on flour for export might not have been reduced somewhat.\r\nThe Interstate Commerce Commission finally rendered a decision to the\r\neffect that the existing difference in rates constituted an undue\r\npreference in favor of the foreign manufacturer, adding at the same\r\ntime that these discriminations seemed to be due primarily not to a\r\ndesire of the railways to aid the American farmer in disposing of this\r\nsurplus wheat, but to the bitterness of competition between the Gulf\r\nand trunk line railways.[110] They decided that any discrimination\r\ngreater than two cents per hundred pounds in favor of wheat for export\r\nas against flour was unreasonable. This difference was permitted,\r\nhowever, on account of the greater cost of handling the manufactured\r\nproduct. It is significant of the then state of the law that the\r\nrailways paid no attention to this order, and, although conditions\r\nimproved somewhat, there is still great complaint.\r\n\r\nThe relative rates on wheat and flour, even when for domestic\r\nconsumption, illustrate the same difficulty of commercial\r\ncompetition--the necessity of adjusting the rate on raw materials to\r\nthat on the finished product.[111] The rate on wheat from Wichita,\r\nKan., for example, to California is fifty-five cents per hundred\r\npounds, while the rate on flour between the same points is sixty-five\r\ncents. Is this difference in rates economically justifiable? California\r\nwheat is soft, so that flour produced from it is much improved by the\r\nadmixture of hard wheat, such as may be obtained in Kansas. California,\r\nformerly a large wheat exporting state, has of late years relied to\r\na considerable degree upon the Middle West for part of its supplies.\r\nKansas flour sells for seventy-five cents a barrel more than California\r\nwheat flour. Shall this Kansas wheat, to be consumed in California, be\r\nground in Wichita or in California? Here is material for controversy,\r\nnot between one particular railway and another, but in reality between\r\nthe millers in Kansas and the millers in California. It is quite\r\nanalogous to the issue raised over export wheat and flour between the\r\nmiller in Chicago and his rival in Liverpool. In this instance, if\r\nmilled in Kansas, the railways enjoy the carriage of flour; while, if\r\nground in California, the railways carry the commodity in the form of\r\nwheat. Owing to certain practical conditions, such as the percentage\r\nof waste and relative differences in labor costs, the Kansas miller\r\nappears to enjoy a certain advantage over his far western competitors.\r\nAt this point the interest of particular railway companies appears.\r\nThe Rock Island, if the milling industry in Kansas develops, obtains\r\nthe haul not only of the flour but also of the fuel and of supplies\r\nfor the communities engaged in the business. On the other hand the\r\nSouthern Pacific is more largely interested in the local development\r\nof manufactures in California. The Rock Island by maintaining a lower\r\nrate on flour than on wheat, would tend to hold its clients in the\r\nfield. The Southern Pacific, on the other hand, by securing the reduced\r\nrate on the wheat from Kansas would materially advance the welfare\r\nof its constituents. Thus the rivalries of the competing localities\r\nimmediately become the direct and immediate concern of rival railways.\r\n\r\nCases precisely analogous in principle to those concerning the\r\nrelativity of rates on grain and grain products have troubled the\r\ncarriers for years in respect to the rates upon cattle and packing\r\nhouse products.[112] A low rate on cattle as compared with beef favors\r\nChicago today as against Missouri river points, the latter being\r\nnearer the cattle ranges; just as a generation ago it enabled cattle\r\nto be brought to New York and Boston to be there slaughtered and sold\r\non the spot. The history of this controversy throws much light upon\r\nthe difficulties of rate making in practice. Originally the railways\r\nencouraged cattle raising by a rate which was only about one-third of\r\nthe rate charged for beef. Slaughtering was carried on in the East\r\nadjacent to the great markets. To this policy the western packers\r\nobjected strenuously. They demanded a relatively low rate on their\r\nfinished product in order to enable them to bid against the local\r\neastern slaughter houses. The stockmen, on the other hand, naturally\r\ndesired a continuance of the low rate on cattle, as it perpetuated\r\ncompetition between eastern and western buyers. The controversy between\r\nthe stock raisers and the packers was thus shifted onto the shoulders\r\nof the traffic managers of the railways. The dispute culminated in\r\n1883 when the Trunk Line Association appointed a special committee to\r\nconsider what the proper adjustment should be.\r\n\r\nThis committee in turn referred the matter to Commissioner Albert\r\nFink, \"Seeking a relativity of rates so as to make the charges for\r\ntransportation, including the expenses incident to the transportation\r\nof dressed beef, the same per pound as the charges per pound of\r\ndressed beef transported to the East in the shape of live stock.\" A\r\ndifficult task this, considering the variety of by-products emerging\r\ninto value year by year. Cattle rates had been for some time fifty-two\r\nper cent., and then later sixty per cent. of the dressed beef rates.\r\nThis was relatively higher for cattle than had been charged during the\r\nseventies. But the western packers demanded that the relativity in\r\nfavor of the finished product be still further advanced until cattle\r\nrates should equal seventy-five per cent. of the rates on beef. This\r\nwould effectually discourage the shipment of cattle to eastern centres,\r\nand would tend to upbuild Kansas City and Chicago at their expense.\r\nIn 1884, the matter being still in dispute, was referred to Hon. T.\r\nM. Cooley, afterward chairman of the Interstate Commerce Commission.\r\nHe decided that a fair compromise would be forty cents on cattle from\r\nChicago to New York with coincident rates of seventy cents on beef.\r\nThis would make the cattle rate about fifty-seven per cent. of the beef\r\nrate. It was a victory for the stockmen as against the western packers,\r\nwho at once raised a great outcry.\r\n\r\nIt would have been difficult to predict the final outcome had not an\r\nentirely new factor appeared, which transformed the conduct of the\r\nbeef packing industry.[113] Specially constructed stock cars owned by\r\nprivate companies began to be built. These favored the perpetuation of\r\ncompetition between eastern and western packers. To checkmate this,\r\nthe western packers had already embarked in 1879 upon the ownership of\r\nprivately owned refrigerator cars for the carriage of their finished\r\nproducts. The custom was adopted by the railways of paying for the use\r\nof these cars by making an allowance of so much a mile as a deduction\r\nfrom the established tariffs. This at once opened the way to secret\r\nrebates of all sorts. The refrigerator traffic in these private cars\r\nwas large in volume, very regular and highly concentrated as to source.\r\nA large tonnage could be diverted at any time to that road which\r\ncould best show its appreciation of the favor. The Grand Trunk, for\r\ninstance, in 1887 swept the board, monopolizing this entire business\r\nfor a brief time, obtaining it by secret and discriminating rates. The\r\nrailways, jointly, sought to free themselves from the domination of\r\nthe large packers; but the phenomenal growth of their business, both\r\ndomestic and export, rendered them too powerful to resist. According to\r\nexpert data, during nine months to May 1, 1889, three shippers alone\r\nreceived from one line of road $72,945 for the use of their cars. This\r\nabout equalled the initial cost of eighty new cars. For the fiscal\r\nyear 1895, $8,744,000 was paid by the railways of the United States\r\nfor the use of these cars--about $4,000,000 of this being in the form\r\nof rental. At this rate, profits of from twenty-five to fifty per\r\ncent. upon the investment accrued to the great packers. These virtual\r\nrebates, of course, drove all competitors from the field. The story\r\nof the gradual extension of this system of private cars to include\r\nfruit and produce business belongs in another place. Suffice it to say\r\nthat the bondage was broken only by the passage of the Hepburn Act of\r\n1906. The growth of these private refrigerator car lines caused the\r\ndisappearance of live stock shipments. Packing and slaughtering on a\r\nlarge scale at the seaboard, either for domestic consumption or export,\r\nwas doomed. Meantime, however, the controversy over the relative rates\r\non beef and cattle continued just as if anything really depended upon\r\nit. The issue was again submitted to the commissioner of the Trunk\r\nLine Association in 1887. In the following year a select committee\r\nof the United States Senate was appointed at the urgent request of\r\nthe cattle raisers. Testimony before this committee showed in detail\r\nhow eastern packers were striving to build up establishments near\r\nthe points of consumption, but were driven out of the business by the\r\nrelatively high costs of shipping cattle, as compared with the rates\r\nat which dressed beef could be actually delivered from Chicago and\r\nMissouri river points. This entire history, aside from its significance\r\nas a study of personal discrimination, illustrates the effect of\r\na relatively increasing differential rate, partly open and partly\r\nsecret, against the raw material of an industry as compared with the\r\nfinished product. The result, at all events, has been to concentrate\r\nthe packing industry in the Middle West. Nor is the controversy closed\r\neven yet.[114] But this time it is a question, not between the seaboard\r\nand Chicago, but between Chicago and Missouri river points, or those\r\nstill nearer the southwestern ranges. Fort Worth and Oklahoma City now\r\nbecome complainants against the Missouri river points.[115] Always and\r\neverywhere the manufacture seeks to develop at or near the source of\r\nthe raw material. Whenever this tendency does not appear in an industry\r\nit is pertinent to inquire how far the relative adjustment of rates is\r\nresponsible for the phenomenon.\r\n\r\nComplexities in rate adjustment often arise from the fact that in\r\nthe manufacture of many commodities the marketing of by-products is\r\nof increasing importance. The rate on the whole series of related\r\ncommodities must be taken into account at once. Thus in lumbering, a\r\nlarge amount of waste or very low-grade lumber is necessarily produced.\r\nThis common lumber cannot bear long transportation; it must be utilized\r\nlocally, if at all. On the other hand, the choicest specialties will\r\ncommand a price even in remote markets. A monopoly price is enjoyed in\r\nsuch a case. The Pacific coast lumbermen can market their long timbers\r\nanywhere in the United States; but the demand for the common lumber,\r\nrestricted to a sparsely populated region, tends to be exceeded by the\r\nsupply.[116] The real competition between the southern, the Michigan,\r\nthe Wisconsin and the Pacific coast manufacturers thus narrows down\r\nto the sale of the medium-grade product. And the cost of production\r\nof this is, of course, in part dependent upon the profit made upon\r\nthe other two sorts, each of which in its own field appears to be a\r\nmonopoly. A wide market and a good price for medium-grade lumber may so\r\nlessen the cost of the cheapest by-products that they in turn may be\r\nso reduced in price as to widen their reach to the consumer. Each rate\r\nreacts upon the others. The situation can be successfully controlled\r\nonly by adjusting them all at once.\r\n\r\nNot only are rates competitive as between raw materials and the\r\nfinished product made from them, but the circle of competition\r\nimmediately widens to include all commodities capable of substitution\r\none for another.[117] Coal rates, of course, are partly determined\r\nby rates on cordwood, and _vice versa_. During the great coal strike\r\nin Pennsylvania in 1903, soft coal rates and hard coal rates were\r\nsadly disturbed. Such substitutions are always likely to occur. But\r\nthe conditions are not always so simple as this. An instance in\r\npoint is given by a witness before the Senate (Elkins) Committee on\r\nInterstate Commerce in 1905.[118] This shows how a reduction in the\r\nrate for transportation of corn from Kansas to Texas brought about\r\na corresponding reduction in the rate on flour from Minneapolis to\r\nChicago. There was a large crop of corn in Kansas; and the Chicago\r\nlines anticipated brisk business in the carriage of this product. The\r\ntraffic managers of lines from Kansas to Texas, however, discovered a\r\nlarge demand for corn in Texas at a price higher than then prevailed\r\nin Kansas. Any rate less than the difference in prices between the\r\ntwo districts would cause shipments of corn to flow from Kansas to\r\nTexas, just as inevitably as water flows down hill. This rate would\r\nneeds be low; but the corn could be loaded on empty southbound cars\r\nwhich had been used to haul cotton out of Texas to the north. This, of\r\ncourse, entailed a diversion of corn from the Chicago railways, which\r\npromptly reduced rates in order to hold their traffic. For years the\r\nrates upon wheat and corn had been fixed in a definite relation to\r\none another, based upon commercial experience. Any reduction of the\r\ncorn rate compelled a reduction of the wheat rate. A fall in the wheat\r\nrate brought about a drop in the rate on flour. These reductions in\r\ncorn started in southern Kansas; but parallel lines in northern Kansas\r\nwere compelled to follow suit. Grain in the territory between the two\r\nroads could be hauled by wagon either north or south corresponding\r\nto a fraction of a cent per bushel difference in the price. Thus the\r\nreduction in rates spread from one line to another all over Kansas,\r\nthroughout Nebraska up into Dakota and finally to Minnesota. It not\r\nonly affected the corn rate everywhere but it caused a reduction in the\r\nrate on flour from Minneapolis to Chicago. The reliance of Texas for a\r\nportion of its corn supply upon the surplus product of Kansas sometimes\r\nleads to odd results. This commodity is sometimes shipped as corn meal\r\nand sometimes transported as corn to be afterwards ground in Texas.\r\nThe Texas millers at one time demanded a relative reduction of the\r\nrate on grain as compared with corn meal, and the railway commission\r\nof that state upheld them in that demand. For ten years down to 1905\r\nthe differential in favor of the raw product had been three cents a\r\nhundred pounds. Then the railways, in connection with a general advance\r\nof rates, increased the charge on corn meal until it amounted to about\r\nnine cents per hundred pounds more than the rate on corn. One cent a\r\nhundred pounds being a good profit in grinding corn meal, this change\r\nshut the Kansas millers out of Texas business. Application was made\r\nto the Interstate Commerce Commission for relief. It then appeared\r\non investigation that the carriers had made use of the Texas millers\r\nin order to prevent a general reduction of _both_ grain rates and\r\nrates on grain products. The Texas millers on general principles had\r\nfavored both these reductions. What happened is best described in the\r\nevidence before the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce of 1905.\r\n\"The railways went to the millers of Texas and they said to them,\r\n'Is there anything you want here?' 'Why,' said the [Texan] millers,\r\n'yes; we would like to have that differential between corn and corn\r\nmeal increased; we think you ought to put the rate on corn meal up.'\r\nThe railway said, 'All right; you just stay away from that meeting\r\ndown at Austin so that there will not be any excuse for the Texas\r\ncommission, and if it undertakes to reduce these rates we will raise\r\nthis differential; we will raise the rate on corn meal to the rate on\r\nflour.' The millers kept away from Austin--they kept their part of\r\nthe bargain--and they stayed away, and the Texas commission was left\r\nwithout any support for their proposition to reduce the corn rates, and\r\nthe railway kept their part of the bargain and lifted up the rate on\r\ncorn meal so that the differential was from nine to seven and one-half\r\ncents, and that put the Kansas mills out of business.\"\r\n\r\nApparently insignificant details often determine the outcome of\r\ncommercial competition. Thus in the milling business, where the margin\r\nof profit in the manufacture of flour may not be over three cents per\r\nbarrel, an infinitesimal change in the freight rate may mean success\r\nor failure to long-established industries. And the conditions vary\r\nindefinitely. Thus, as between flour milling in Duluth and Buffalo,\r\nDuluth can buy its wheat from the farmer direct during the entire\r\nwinter, but must ship its product mainly during the period of open\r\nwater navigation on the lakes. The reverse is true with the Buffalo\r\nmiller who can ship out his flour during the entire season, but who\r\nmust accumulate his whole stock of wheat before navigation closes. And\r\nthen Minneapolis as a milling centre has to be taken into account.\r\nEighty per cent. of the spring wheat grown in the United States is\r\nin territory from which the freight rates to Minneapolis and Duluth\r\nare the same. But the basic rate to the East and Europe, fixing the\r\nall-rail rates, is the combined lake and rail. By this route Duluth\r\nis one hundred and fifty miles nearer the market than is Minneapolis,\r\nand consequently enjoys a lower rate on its flour shipped out. A\r\nthree-cornered competitive problem exists, in which any change at one\r\npoint entirely upsets the commercial equilibrium.\r\n\r\nThe obligation on the part of a railway to protect its constituency,\r\nnot only in respect of particular rates, but in general conditions as\r\nwell, introduces still further complications. The freight business\r\nof New England, for example, consists, first, of the carriage of raw\r\nmaterials and supplies inwards; and, secondly, thereafter of the\r\ntransportation of the finished product out to the consuming markets.\r\nNarrowly considered, it may seem expedient to crowd the rate on coal\r\nas high as the value of service probably will permit; but viewed in a\r\nlarge way, it may prove to be a far better business policy to maintain\r\nthe rate on coal, cotton, and other staple supplies so low, that the\r\ngrowth of population and production may in the long run yield far\r\ngreater returns on the high-grade manufactures which the territory\r\nproduces. Turning to the southern field, where the economic conditions\r\nare reversed, it may be the better policy to hold down the rate on\r\nraw cotton in order thereby to stimulate this great basic industry\r\nand thereby enhance the demand for the merchandise and foodstuffs\r\nwhich depend upon general prosperity. A free hand afforded for the\r\nsuitable adjustment of such apparently independent services may\r\ncontribute far more to the general welfare than an insistence upon\r\na petty and near-sighted policy of extorting from each individual\r\nservice all the rate it can possibly endure. American railway managers\r\nare gradually but surely coming to take a more liberal view of these\r\ngreat possibilities and to consider the economic development of their\r\nterritories, not narrowly, but in a generous way.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[64] Testimony before the Hepburn Committee, in 1879, p. 2921, is\r\ninteresting on this point.\r\n\r\n[65] U.

This is\r\npeculiarly true of a rapidly growing country like the United States.\r\nAn admirable instance is afforded by the complaint of the Lincoln\r\nCommercial Club before the Interstate Commerce Commission.[119]\r\nLincoln, Nebraska, lies about fifty-five miles southwest of Omaha.\r\nOriginally all its supplies came from the East, as both cities were\r\nfor a time outposts of civilization. The coal supply came from Iowa\r\nand Illinois, and the salt from Michigan. On these and most other\r\ncommodities the rates to Lincoln were made up of a through rate from\r\nthe East to the Missouri river, plus the local rate on to destination.\r\nThe city of Lincoln thus paid considerably more than Omaha for all of\r\nits supplies. Gradually conditions have changed; until in 1907 it\r\nappeared that over half the soft coal consumed in Lincoln was brought\r\nfrom Kansas and Missouri; four-fifths of the lumber from the South and\r\nnearly all the rest from the Pacific coast; glass and salt from the gas\r\nbelt and salt beds of Kansas; and a great deal of beet sugar from the\r\nwestern fields. For a large proportion of these and other supplies,\r\nLincoln was actually as near or nearer the point of production than\r\nOmaha, and yet the difficulties of effecting an adjustment between\r\nrival carriers had prevented any modification of rates corresponding\r\nto these changes in economic conditions. On every one of these\r\ncommodities the rate to Lincoln remained steadily higher than to Omaha,\r\nregardless of the source of supply. Unanimous consent was necessary\r\nfor readjustment. So long as any single road refused assent, a general\r\nrate disturbance might be precipitated by any independent action. The\r\nbeneficent effect of the exercise of governmental authority, powerful\r\nenough over all interested parties to compel acquiescence, has been\r\nclearly apparent in affording relief.\r\n\r\nA similar instance in the state of Wisconsin is afforded by the\r\ncompulsory readjustment of the freight rate on wood pulp, lumber and\r\nsawed logs.[120] On investigation it appeared that, despite a very much\r\nlower commercial value for the raw material used in paper manufacture,\r\nthe rates on pulp wood were more than double those on logs to be sawed\r\nup for lumber. It appeared, furthermore, that this apparent anomaly was\r\ndue not so much to high rates on the pulp wood as to very low rates\r\non sawed logs. These latter rates for many years had been fixed at a\r\nvery low figure because originally the bulk of such logs, cut in the\r\nriver bottoms, was floated down stream to mills along the Mississippi\r\nriver. Competition with lumber raft rates originally determined the\r\ncharges on lumber by rail. The paper industry did not begin until these\r\nconditions of water competition had quite disappeared. Gradually, with\r\nthe progress of deforestation, all the timber is now found on the\r\nuplands far from navigable water courses; so that the rates today\r\nare not at all influenced by competitive rates on the lumber rafts\r\ndown river. Nevertheless the old tariffs on lumber remained in force\r\ndespite the changed conditions, while the new rates on pulp wood were\r\nfixed independently of any rates by water. It was only after careful\r\ninvestigation that the injustice to the paper manufacturers from the\r\ndisparity in charges appeared. Here again it was the rigidity and\r\ninterlocked complexity of adjustment which placed it in the power of\r\none road to block change of any sort.[121] The compulsory exercise\r\nof governmental authority cut the Gordian knot with the result that\r\nsubstantial justice now obtains.[122]\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding statements it will be observed that carriers have\r\nanother important commercial function beside that of equalizing\r\nindustrial conditions.[123] They also act in a protective or insurance\r\ncapacity to the merchant or manufacturer. The policy of \"keeping\r\neveryone in business\" implies not only variety but variability of\r\nconditions. Capital is proverbially timid. It will not venture into a\r\nnew and uncertain enterprise unless either profits are immediate and\r\nhigh or, if moderate, likely to endure. In any event some guarantee of\r\npermanence is required. This guarantee the carrier is often able to\r\noffer. It may assume the obligation of protecting its clients; that is,\r\nof saving them harmless against the intrusion or irruption of hurtful\r\ncompetition. It thus exercises in a certain sense the function of an\r\ninsurance company, but with this important difference: that while it\r\nhas the strongest interest in protecting its established industries\r\nagainst ruinous competition from abroad, it may desire to share in\r\nsome degree in their development and prosperity by way of reward. In\r\nthis latter sense the relation of the carrier to its clients partakes\r\nof a profit-sharing arrangement. One of the broadest issues between\r\nAmerican railways and the public at the present time is precisely this:\r\nwhether the carriers are to share in business profits; or merely, in\r\naddition to furnishing transportation, are to collect a fixed fee for\r\na service in the nature of industrial insurance. That it lies in their\r\nway to furnish such protection under modern economic practice is an\r\nindisputable fact.\r\n\r\nThis nice question is almost daily pressing for solution at the\r\nhands of the Interstate Commerce Commission. It arises every time an\r\nincrease of freight rates occurs. Take, for example, the Pacific coast\r\nlumber cases of 1908. The dissenting opinions of the Commission show\r\nhow debatable the proposition is.[124] Up to about 1893 the lumber\r\ninterests of the Pacific coast were quite undeveloped and entirely\r\ndependent upon water transportation for reaching markets. At this\r\ntime low rates of forty to sixty cents per hundred pounds on forest\r\nproducts to markets in the Middle West were introduced, partly to\r\nbuild up the industry and partly to create a back loading for the\r\npreponderantly westbound tonnage of all transcontinental lines. Under\r\nthese rates the business has enormously developed until, on the\r\nNorthern Pacific road in 1906, the shipments of lumber east bound\r\namounted to one-third of its entire traffic both ways, and yielded\r\nnearly one-fifth of its freight revenue. So greatly had this traffic\r\nexpanded that it aided, if not actually produced, a reversal of the\r\ndirection of transcontinental empties. Practically all these roads now\r\nhave an excess of tonnage to the east whereas ten years ago much the\r\nlarger volume of freight was moving westward. Meantime the lumbermen\r\nunder the stimulus of these lower rates, and of the phenomenal rise in\r\nthe price of lumber, had been wonderfully prosperous. The price of\r\nlogs had risen since 1893 from about $2.50 per 1,000 feet to $13.50\r\nin 1906; partly in consequence of the extraordinary demand consequent\r\non the Valparaiso and San Francisco earthquakes. The mills had moved\r\nin from the rivers and the coast, and had become absolutely dependent\r\nupon rail transportation for reaching markets. At this stage, and\r\nmost unfortunately in November, 1907, just at a time of industrial\r\npanic, the carriers raised their rates by about ten cents per one\r\nhundred pounds. The market price of logs had already dropped from\r\n$13.50 per thousand by approximately one-third. These two causes,\r\ncommercial depression and the increased freight rate, brought about a\r\ncomplete collapse in the industry. And the increased freight rates were\r\ncontested before the Interstate Commerce Commission in the hope that,\r\nas in the southern field the rate increases from Georgia points had\r\nbeen annulled,[125] these might also be found unreasonable. The broad\r\nquestion concerns the obligation of carriers, once having brought about\r\nan investment of capital in the industry, to continue to give the same\r\nrates as those under which the ventures had been undertaken, due regard\r\nbeing had, of course, to such changes in costs of service as might have\r\nensued. The lumbermen demand that all the increment of profit due to\r\nprosperous developments shall remain unto them; in other words, that\r\nthe carriers' share of the increased values shall remain fixed. On the\r\nother hand, the railways defend their increases, partly upon the ground\r\nof increasing expenses of operation, and partly upon the broader ground\r\nthat the freight rate being proportioned to the price of the product,\r\nshould rise in harmony with it. Upon this question the Commission was\r\ndivided, the majority holding in favor of annulling the increase,\r\nwhile the chairman and one other member decided that the increase was\r\njustifiable.[126]\r\n\r\nElasticity and quick adaptation to the exigencies of business are\r\npeculiarities of American railway operation. Our railway managers\r\nhave always been most progressive in seeking, in and out of season,\r\nto develop new territory and build up traffic. The strongest contrast\r\nbetween Europe and the United States lies in this fact. European\r\nrailways more often take business as they find it. Our railways\r\n_make_ it. Much of this business is made possible only by special\r\nrates adapted to the case in hand. These need not be secret or\r\ndiscriminating, as has already been observed. For although offered with\r\nreference to particular cases, they may be open to all comers. The\r\neconomic justification lies in the fact that the railway can afford\r\nto make a low rate, leaving a bare margin of profit above the _extra_\r\ncost of adding this traffic to that which is already in motion. Such\r\nrates cannot exceed a definite figure based upon what the traffic will\r\nbear. A higher rate than this would kill the business. Something is\r\ncontributed toward fixed charges by the new traffic, so far as the\r\nrailway is concerned; and at the same time the shipper on his part\r\nis enabled to enlarge his operations. Yet such a scale of rates if\r\napplied to the whole traffic of the railway might be ruinous in the\r\nextreme. The domestic shipper of wheat may conceivably be helped,\r\nrather than injured, by a special rate on grain for Liverpool without\r\nwhich the railway would lose the business entirely. To transport\r\nCalifornia fruit for a mere fraction of the rate per ton mile which\r\nis laid upon other traffic may actually enable those other goods to\r\nbe carried more cheaply than before. Of course, if the other traffic\r\nbe directly competitive, as for instance in this case, oranges from\r\nFlorida, that is an entirely different matter. Railway representatives\r\nrightfully insist upon these special rates to develop new business as\r\na boon to the commercial world. They contrast them with the hard and\r\nfast schedules of European railways. They allege that such elasticity\r\nloosens the joints of competition, \"keeps everyone in business,\"\r\nequalizes prices over large areas, and is in fact the life of trade.\r\nOne of the stock objections to railway regulation is that it may\r\nlessen this elasticity, \"substitute mile posts for brains,\" and produce\r\nstagnation in place of activity.\r\n\r\nParadoxical as it may seem, a certain rigidity of rate schedules is a\r\nnatural consequence of the very delicacy with which individual rates\r\nare adjusted to meet the demands of trade. Each road is jealously\r\nand aggressively alert to protect its own constituency regardless\r\nof the rights of others. No single traffic manager is free to grant\r\nreductions of rates, even when considered to be just, by reason of\r\nthe opposition of competing lines. The consent of every one of these\r\ninterests is necessary in order to insure stability, and the penalty\r\nfor acting independently may be a rate war, disastrously affecting\r\nrelations with connecting lines. Thus, for example, in the South the\r\nSouthern Railway for some time was willing to concede, as a measure\r\nof justice, a reduction of rates on cotton from Mississippi river\r\npoints to the mills in North and South Carolina.[127] The growth of\r\nthe textile industry had resulted in a demand for cotton far exceeding\r\nthe production of the Carolinas. At the same time the increasing\r\nattention devoted to manufacturing of a higher grade had forced the\r\nmanufacturers to draw upon the long-staple supplies of the Mississippi\r\nbottom lands. The Piedmont cotton was too short in fibre for the finer\r\nsort of goods. The Carolina mills were, however, compelled to pay a\r\nhigher rate upon cotton from such points as Memphis than was paid for\r\nthe long haul up to New England. Thus, for instance, as late as 1900,\r\nrates were fifty-nine cents to South Carolina, while they were only\r\nfifty-five and one-half cents per hundred pounds from the same points\r\nto New England mills. This was obviously unjust. But the Southern\r\nRailway alone, interested in the welfare of its Carolina clients, was\r\npowerless to act without the consent of its competitors operating\r\nfrom Memphis west of the Alleghanies. These latter lines, having no\r\ninterest in the southern mills and a unity of interest in the long haul\r\ntraversed to New England, sought to prevent an equalization of the\r\ndifferences. Controlling rates also on cotton for export to various\r\nseaports, they were for a long time able to prevent a change. On the\r\nother hand, in the same territory the railways operating south from\r\nCincinnati and Louisville desired to reduce rates on manufactured\r\nproducts from the Central West.[128] These were the very lines which\r\nin the former instance prevented the reduction of cotton rates on the\r\nSouthern Railway to Carolina points, by threats to meet such reductions\r\nby cutting their own rates on cotton going north through the Ohio\r\ngateways. Yet a reduction of their rates on manufactures for building\r\nup western trade threatened the business of the Southern Railway, which\r\nhad been mainly interested in the traffic from Atlanta seaboard points.\r\nIt may readily be seen that this situation, extending to practically\r\nevery important point, \"jacked up\" all these rates, not because of\r\ntheir inherent reasonableness and not even because the railways\r\nindependently acknowledged them to be just, but simply and solely\r\nbecause any disturbance of this house of cards might lead to a general\r\ndownfall of the whole system.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting example of the difficulty of bringing about a\r\nchange in rate adjustment is afforded in the transcontinental field.\r\nFor some years a general agreement seems to have been adopted as a\r\nsort of a compromise between the various conflicting interests. Under\r\npresent conditions Chicago and all points east of the Mississippi\r\nfrom Maine to Florida enjoy precisely the same rate to the Pacific\r\ncoast.[129] Chicago has at various times contended before the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission for graded rates which should recognize,\r\nfor instance, that being 1,200 miles nearer San Francisco than Boston\r\non the basis of distance, it should have proportionately lower freight\r\nrates. Apparently some of the transcontinental roads, such as the Great\r\nNorthern, have been willing to make this concession. They could not,\r\nhowever, take any action without first obtaining the consent of every\r\nrailway and steamship company with which they compete. Inasmuch as\r\nalmost every railway in the country participates in transcontinental\r\nbusiness, an agreement was practically impossible. Entirely aside from\r\nthe merits of this particular intricate question, it must be borne in\r\nmind that there is no such thing as independence of action on behalf of\r\nany single carrier. It becomes exceedingly easy for one road to play a\r\ndog-in-the-manger part. The shipper may be subjected to an extortionate\r\npolicy, not dictated by the road over which he ships, as a matter of\r\nfact, but by roads operating perhaps a thousand or more miles away.\r\n\r\nPraiseworthy as is the elasticity of railway rates in the United\r\nStates, there is, nevertheless, much to be said in support of the\r\ncontention that at times this has been carried to an extreme. Stability\r\nand certainty have been treated as of secondary importance. Particular\r\nshippers have been aided, but the general interests of trade have\r\nsuffered some injurious consequences. It is not entirely clear whether\r\nthe advantage gained from elasticity has at all times been worth the\r\ncost. Certain of the disadvantages of instability of rates seem to have\r\nbeen overlooked.\r\n\r\nIn the first place railway tariffs have in the past undoubtedly\r\nbeen too voluminous and complex. The number of these filed with the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission is extremely large. Eleven railways\r\nalone during the year to November 30, 1904, filed 30,125. The total\r\nschedules of all American railways filed during the year to November\r\n30, 1907, was 220,982. One single carrier had 15,700 tariffs in force\r\nat the same time. The New York Central & Hudson River in December,\r\n1899, had no less than 1,370 special commodity rates in force. There\r\nwere endless contradictions and conflicts. Secret rates were hidden in\r\ndevious ways in this mass of publications. Special tariffs \"expiring\r\nwith this shipment\"; rates quoted not numerically but by numbered\r\nreference to tariffs of other carriers and applicable by different\r\nroutes; agreements to meet rates of any competing carriers, were among\r\nthe irregular methods of concealment adopted. Although literally\r\ncomplying with the law by publicly filing all tariffs, conditions\r\nwere often such that not even an expert in rates could discover in\r\nthis maze of conflicting evidence what the rate at any time actually\r\nwas. The door was opened wide to personal discrimination and abuses\r\nof all kinds.[130] Those conditions are not necessary. They do not\r\nobtain on the best roads in other parts of the world. Nor is such\r\ninstability found in respect of some important lines of trade. No\r\nagricultural product fluctuates in price more abruptly or widely than\r\nraw cotton,--from five to seventeen cents a pound. Yet the rates on\r\nthat commodity have remained quite undisturbed throughout the southern\r\nstates for many years. But the best proof of all that rates have been\r\nunduly numerous, is the great reduction in volume which has taken place\r\nsince 1910 under compulsion of law. This feature will be especially\r\nconsidered in another connection.[131]\r\n\r\nThe second disadvantage of too great elasticity in freight rates\r\nis that it may, at times, promote rather than lessen that state of\r\neconomic unrest inevitable in all business, especially in a new\r\ncountry. Under a continual disturbance of rates, the merchant is unable\r\nwith security to enter into long-time contracts. Rates are sometimes\r\nchanged, not to suit the shipper but to serve the railway's interests.\r\nSometimes traffic may be diverted from its natural channels. The\r\nspirit of initiative and self-reliance on the part of shippers may be\r\nundermined. Persistent titillation of competition may be pleasant for\r\na time, but its final results may be injurious. Constant appeal to the\r\ntraffic manager of his road for aid and comfort may quite naturally\r\ndivert the shipper's attention from an aggressive commercial policy\r\nwhich would render him independent of minor changes in freight rates.\r\nThe more responsibility the traffic manager assumes, the more may be\r\nput upon him. And it must always be remembered that each move by one\r\nroad to protect a client, will probably be checkmated by the tactics\r\nof rival lines. Economic peace, not warfare, should be encouraged\r\nby the services of common carriers. One of the positive advantages\r\nof governmental regulation of railway rates is that it contributes\r\nto stability. That this view is shared by experienced railway men,\r\nappears from the following testimony of President Mellen of the New\r\nHaven road.[132] \"I think that great trouble comes to the business of\r\nthis country through the fact of these little breaks in rates. During\r\nNovember two new railways were opened into the city of Denver. They\r\nsought to make themselves popular by lowering rates, and rates went\r\ndown very low. They went down legally, but they went down very low.\r\nJust before the rates went down the merchants of the city had stocked\r\nDenver with goods and the lowering of the rates demoralized their\r\nprices; they lost a large amount of money, and dissatisfaction was\r\ncaused from Chicago to Denver. Lowering of rates demoralized business\r\ngenerally. I think if those roads had known that the rates which they\r\nmade had to remain in force thirty days they would have hesitated\r\nbefore they lowered them. I would increase the time required before\r\nrates could be reduced.\"\r\n\r\nThe foregoing consideration suggests still another argument in favor\r\nof stability of freight rates, even at the expense of a certain amount\r\nof flexibility. Special rates which create new business should be\r\ncarefully distinguished from special rates which merely wrest business\r\nfrom other carriers or markets. Any expedient which will make two\r\nblades of grass grow where one grew before; which puts American wheat\r\ninto Liverpool in competition with India and Argentina; which cheapens\r\nCalifornia fruit on the eastern markets; which offers a wider choice\r\nof building stone for Chicago; which will establish new industries\r\nfor the utilization of local raw materials, deserves the greatest\r\nencouragement. Our country has been unprecedentedly developed in\r\nconsequence of the energy and progressiveness of its railway managers.\r\nBut thousands of other special rates have no such justification, even\r\nwhere they are public and open to all shippers alike. These are the\r\nexpression of railway ambition to build up trade by invading territory\r\nnaturally tributary to other railways or traders. A significant feature\r\nof commercial competition is the utilization of distant markets\r\nas available \"dumping grounds\" for the surplus products left over\r\nfrom the local or natural market. In the St. Louis Business Men's\r\nLeague case[133] the Pacific coast jobbers complained that the large\r\ndistributing houses in the Middle West thus invaded their territory.\r\nHaving met their fixed charges from their own natural territory, they\r\ninvaded the remotest districts by cutting prices to the level of actual\r\nproduction cost per unit of new business. The Florida orange growers\r\nprotest against the relatively lower rate on California fruit, which\r\nis carried twice the distance for less money per box. This, it is\r\nurged, enables the western grower, having glutted his natural market\r\nin the Middle West, to \"dump\" his surplus into the eastern field, to\r\nwhich alone the Florida orange is restricted. This line of argument\r\nis the same as that which upholds the systems under which lower rates\r\nare given for exported or imported commodities than those on goods for\r\ndomestic consumption. It is always alleged that such sales at long\r\nreach actually benefit the consumer or producer near at hand, inasmuch\r\nas they contribute something toward the fixed expenses of the business,\r\nwhich must be borne in any event. This raises at once the much broader\r\nquestion as to what constitutes a \"natural market\" or the \"natural\r\nterritory\" which rightfully belongs to any given economic agent. It\r\nis, however, too extended an issue to be discussed at this time.[134]\r\n\r\nToo many special commodity rates, intended to meet the needs of\r\nparticular shippers instead of increasing new business, may merely\r\nbring about economic waste through exchange between widely separated\r\nmarkets or by causing an invasion of fields naturally tributary to\r\nother centres.[135] Whenever a community producing a surplus of a given\r\ncommodity supplies itself, nevertheless, with that same commodity from\r\na distant market, economic loss results. Numerous instances could be\r\ncited where identical products are redistributed after a long carriage\r\nto and from a distant point in the very area of original production.\r\nDried fruits may be distributed by wholesale grocers at Chicago in the\r\ngreat fruit-raising regions of the West and South. Cotton goods made\r\nby southern mills may be shipped to New York or Chicago, and then sent\r\nback again for final distribution with the addition of a middleman's\r\ncommission and a double freight rate. The Colorado Fuel & Iron Company\r\nseeks special rates in order to sell goods over in Pittsburg territory;\r\nwhile its great competitor, the United States Steel Corporation, has\r\nan equal ambition for the trade of the Pacific Slope. In another case\r\nit appeared that a sash and blind manufacturer in Detroit was seeking\r\nto extend his market in New England. Manufacturers of the same goods\r\nin Vermont were simultaneously marketing their product in Michigan.\r\nThe Detroit producer did not complain of this invasion of his home\r\nterritory, but objected to the freight rate from Boston to Detroit,\r\nwhich, probably because of back loading, was only about one-half the\r\nrate on his own goods from Detroit to the seaboard. Is not this an\r\neconomic anomaly? Two producers, presumably of equal efficiency, are\r\neach invading the territory naturally tributary to the other and are\r\nenabled to do so by reason of the railway policy of \"keeping everyone\r\nin business.\" The New England railways are compelled by reason of the\r\nremoteness to their territory to defend this policy. As President\r\nTuttle, of the Boston & Maine, expresses it, \"I should be just as much\r\ninterested in the stimulating of Chicago manufacturers in sending\r\ntheir products into New England to sell as I would be in sending\r\nthose from New England into Chicago to sell. It is the business of\r\nthe railways centering in Chicago to send the products from Chicago\r\nin every direction. It is our particular business in New England to\r\nsend New England products all over the country. The more they scatter\r\nthe better it is for the railways. The railway does not discriminate\r\nagainst shipments because they are east bound or west bound. We are\r\nglad to see the same things come from Chicago into New England that\r\nare manufactured and sent from New England into Chicago.\" No one\r\nquestions for a moment that the widening of the sphere of competition\r\nby transportation agencies is a service of incalculable benefit to\r\nthe country. But it should also be borne in mind that superfluous\r\ntransportation is economic waste. The industrial combinations in\r\nseeking to effect a strategic location of their factories in order to\r\ndivide the field have apparently come to a full recognition of this\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nA fourth objection to undue development of special commodity rates is\r\nthat they may entail increased burdens upon the local constituency of\r\neach railway. The proportion of such special rates is fifty per cent\r\ngreater in America than in the United Kingdom. It is plain that each\r\nshipment which fails to bear its due proportion of fixed charges, even\r\nthough contributing something thereto, leaves the weight of interest\r\nand maintenance charges upon the shoulders of the local shipper. To\r\nbe sure, those special rates which permanently create new business,\r\noperate otherwise. But in the vast complex, each railway often wrests\r\nfrom competing carriers only about as much tonnage as it loses. It\r\ninvades rival territory, but its own constituency is invaded in\r\nretaliation. Thus there is rolled up an inordinately large proportion\r\nof such special traffic, leaving the regular shipments and the local\r\ntrade to bear the brunt of fixed charges. Momentous social consequences\r\nmay result. Not only the cost of doing business, but the expense of\r\nliving in the smaller places is increased. One of the most dangerous\r\nsocial tendencies at the present time is the enormous concentration\r\nof population and wealth in great cities. Increased efficiency and\r\neconomy in production are much to be desired; but social and political\r\nstability must not be sacrificed thereto. Is it not possible that a\r\npowerful decentralizing influence may be exerted by checking this\r\nindiscriminate and often wasteful long-distance competition, through\r\ngreater insistence upon the rights of geographical location?\r\n\r\nFinally, an abnormal disregard of distance, which is always possible\r\nin the making of special rates to meet particular cases, may bring\r\nabout a certain inelasticity of industrial conditions. This may occur\r\nin either one of two ways. The rise of new industries may be hindered;\r\nor the well-merited relative decline of old ones under a process of\r\nnatural selection may be postponed or averted. The difficult problem\r\nof fairly adjusting rates on raw materials to finished products in\r\norder that the growth of new industries may take place, while at the\r\nsame time the old established ones shall not be cramped or restricted,\r\nhas already been discussed. It is equally plain that at times there\r\nmay be danger of perpetuating an industry in a district, regardless of\r\nthe physical disabilities under which it is conducted. One cannot for\r\na moment doubt the advantages of a protective policy on the part of\r\nrailways; safe-guarding industry against violent dislocating shocks.\r\nAn inevitable transition to new and perhaps better conditions may\r\nperhaps be rendered easier to bear. To New England, constantly exposed\r\nto the competition of new industries rising in the West, this policy\r\nhas been of inestimable value. On the other hand, it is incontestable\r\nthat in the long run the whole country will fare best when each\r\nindustry is prosecuted in the most favored location, conditions of\r\nmarketing as well as of mere production being always considered. If\r\nPittsburg is the natural centre for iron and steel production, it may\r\nnot be an unmixed advantage to the country at large, however great its\r\nvalue to New England, to have the carriers perpetuate the barbed wire\r\nmanufacturers at Worcester. If California can raise a finer or more\r\nmarketable variety of orange, and at a lower cost, than Florida, it\r\nwould be a backward step to counteract the natural advantage of the\r\nwestern field by compelling the southern railways to reduce their rates\r\nto an amount equal to the disability under which the Florida grower\r\nworks. The principle laid down by the so-called \"Bogue differentials\"\r\nin the lumber trade[136] bears upon this point. In order to equalize\r\nconditions between a large number of lumbering centres sending their\r\nproducts to a common market, certain differentials between them\r\nwere allowed under arbitration, \"to enable each line to place its\r\nfair proportion of lumber in the territory.\" Did this mean that the\r\ndisability of any place in manufacturing cost, should be compensated by\r\na corresponding reduction in the ensuing transportation cost? This was\r\nthe view of some of the carriers who were zealous to keep the market\r\nopen to all on equal terms. Yet it is evident that, carried beyond a\r\ncertain point, such a policy would not only nullify all advantages of\r\ngeographical location, but it would also reverse the process of natural\r\nselection and of survival of the fittest, upon which all industrial\r\nprogress must ultimately depend. Each particular case, however, must be\r\ndecided on its merits. Our purpose is not to pass judgment on any one,\r\nbut merely to call attention to the possible effect of such practices\r\nupon the process of industrial development.\r\n\r\nCentralization, or concentration of population, industry and wealth\r\nis characteristic of all progressive peoples at the present time.\r\nGreat economic advantages, through division of labor and cheapened\r\nproduction, have resulted; but, on the other hand, manifold evils\r\nhave followed in its train. Sometimes it appears as if American\r\nrailway practices, in granting commodity and flat long-distance\r\nrates so freely, operated in some ways to retard this tendency. But\r\nthe influence is not all in that direction. Many staple industries,\r\nutilizing the raw material at their doors, might supply the needs of\r\ntheir several local constituencies, were it not that their rise is\r\nprevented by long-distance rates from remote but larger centres of\r\nproduction. Denver, in striving to establish paper mills to utilize its\r\nown Colorado wood pulp, is threatened by the low rates from Wisconsin\r\ncentres. Each locality, ambitious to become self-supporting, is\r\nhindered by the persistency of competition from far away cities. This\r\nis particularly true of distributive business. The overweening ambition\r\nof the great cities to monopolize the jobbing trade, regardless of\r\ndistance, has already been discussed. And it follows, of course, that\r\nthe larger the city the more forcibly may it press its demands upon the\r\ncarriers for low rates to the most remote hamlets. The files of the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission are stocked with examples of this kind.\r\nThe plea of the smaller cities and the agricultural states--Iowa, for\r\nexample--for a right to share in the jobbing naturally tributary to\r\nthem by reason of their location, formed no inconsiderable element in\r\nthe recent popular demand for legislation by the Federal government.\r\n\r\nThe marked difference between competition in transportation and trade\r\nhas long been recognized in economic writing, but has not as yet been\r\naccorded due weight in law. The most essential difference arises from\r\nthe fact, already fully set forth, that a large proportion of railway\r\nexpenditures are entirely independent of the amount of business done.\r\nThis involves as a consequence, the exemption of carriers from the\r\nfundamental law of evolution. Survival of the fittest does not obtain\r\nas a rule in railway competition. The poorest equipped, the most\r\ncircuitous and most nearly insolvent road is often able to dictate\r\nterms to the standard and most direct trunk lines. This has been\r\nexemplified time and again in the history of rate wars the world\r\nover.[137] The bankrupt road having repudiated its fixed charges has\r\nnothing to lose by carrying business at any figure which will pay\r\nthe mere cost of haulage. The indirect line having no business at\r\nthe outset has nothing to lose, and everything to gain. The Canadian\r\nPacific, for example, was perhaps originally built without any\r\nexpectation of being able to participate in San Francisco business; and\r\nyet, like the Grand Trunk, it has always been an active factor in the\r\ndetermination of transcontinental tariffs.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that cost of production, while in trade fixing a point\r\nbelow which people may refuse to produce or compete, in transportation\r\nmay merely mark the point at which it becomes more wasteful to stop\r\nproducing than to go on producing at a loss. Hadley's classic statement\r\nis so admirable that it cannot be improved upon. \"Let us take an\r\ninstance from railway business, here made artificially simple for the\r\nsake of clearness, but in its complicated forms occurring every day. A\r\nrailway connects two places not far apart, and carries from one to the\r\nother (say) 100,000 tons of freight a month at twenty-five cents a ton.\r\nOf the $25,000 thus earned, $10,000 is paid out for the actual expenses\r\nof running the trains and loading or unloading the cars; $5000 for\r\nrepairs and general expenses; the remaining $10,000 pays the interest\r\non the cost of construction. Only the first of these items varies in\r\nproportion to the amount of business done; the interest is a fixed\r\ncharge, and the repairs have to be made with almost equal rapidity,\r\nwhether the material wears out, rusts out, or washes out. Now suppose\r\na parallel road is built, and in order to secure some of this business\r\noffers to take it at twenty cents a ton. The old road must meet the\r\nreduction in order not to lose its business, even though the new figure\r\ndoes not leave it a fair profit on its investment; better a moderate\r\nprofit than none at all. The new road reduces to fifteen cents; so\r\ndoes the old road. A fifteen cent rate will not pay interest unless\r\nthere are new business conditions developed by it; but it will pay for\r\nrepairs, which otherwise would be a dead loss. The new road makes a\r\nstill further reduction to eleven cents. This will do little toward\r\npaying repairs, but that little is better than nothing. If you take at\r\neleven cents freight that cost you twenty-five cents to handle, you\r\nlose fourteen cents on every ton you carry. If you refuse to take it at\r\nthat rate, you lose fifteen cents on every ton you do not carry. For\r\nyour charges for interest and repairs run on, while the other road gets\r\nthe business.\"[138]\r\n\r\nAnother peculiarity of railway competition, distinguishing it from\r\ncompetition in trade, is that there is no such thing as abandonment of\r\nthe field. This is tersely expressed by Morawetz in his Corporation\r\nLaw. \"It should be observed that competition among railway companies\r\nhas not the same safeguard as competition in trade. Persons will\r\nordinarily do business only when they see a fair chance of profit, and\r\nif press of competition renders a particular trade unprofitable, those\r\nengaged in that trade will suspend or reduce their operations, and\r\napply their capital or labor to other uses until a reasonable margin\r\nof profit is reached. But the capital invested in the construction of\r\na railway cannot be withdrawn when competition renders the operation\r\nof the road unprofitable. A railway is of no use except for railway\r\npurposes, and if the operation of the road were stopped, the capital\r\ninvested in its construction would be wholly lost. Hence it is for\r\nthe interest of the railway company to operate its road, though\r\nthe earnings are barely sufficient to pay the operating expenses.\r\nThe ownership of the road may pass from the shareholders to the\r\nbond-holders, and be of no profit to the latter; but the struggle\r\nfor traffic will continue so long as the means of paying operating\r\nexpenses can be raised. Unrestricted competition will thus render\r\nthe competitive traffic wholly unremunerative, and will cause the\r\nultimate bankruptcy of the companies unless the operation of their\r\ntraffic which is not the subject of competition can be made to bear\r\nthe entire burden of the interest and fixed charges.\" So profoundly\r\nmodified in short are the conditions of railway competition by contrast\r\nwith those in industry, that it is clear beyond a shadow of doubt\r\nthat a railway is essentially a monopoly. This requires no proof so\r\nfar as local business, in distinction from through or competitive\r\ntraffic, is concerned. It is equally true in respect to all traffic of\r\nsufficient importance to bring about pooling agreements or a division\r\nof the business, in order to forfend bankruptcy and consolidation.\r\nTo attempt to perpetuate competition between railways by legislation\r\nis thus defeating its own end. The prohibition of pooling agreements\r\nwhich refuses to recognize the naturally monopolistic character of the\r\nbusiness, can have but one result, namely, to compel consolidation as a\r\nmeasure of self-preservation. Such legislation defeats itself, bringing\r\nabout the very result it was intended to prevent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo general theories governing the rates chargeable by railways are\r\nentertained, known respectively as cost of service and value of\r\nservice. According to the first, the proper rate for transportation\r\nshould be based upon the cost for carriage of the persons or goods,\r\nwith an allowance for a reasonable profit over and above the expenses\r\nof operation involved. This line of argument is commonly advanced by\r\nrepresentatives of shippers and the public, who reason by analogy from\r\nother lines of business. In several European countries when railways\r\nwere first built, and afterward, especially in Germany in 1867,\r\nattempts were made to apply this principle widely in the construction\r\nof tariffs. Practical railway men, on the other hand, usually adhere\r\nto the second principle of value of service. This argument maintains\r\nthat, while theoretically cost of service should determine minimum\r\nrates, owing to the nature of commercial competition, as a matter\r\nof fact rates must be based upon the principle of charging what the\r\ntraffic will bear. This is accomplished by proportioning the rate to\r\nthe commercial value of the service. Practically the rate is found\r\nby charging as much as the traffic will stand without evidence of\r\ndiscouragement. Thus if the price per bushel of wheat in New York\r\nis twenty-five cents higher than in Chicago, it would obviously be\r\nabsurd to charge a rate which would absorb all of that increment of\r\nplace value due to transportation. Enough margin must be left to the\r\nshipper who buys wheat in Chicago and sells it in New York, to permit a\r\nreasonable profit on the transaction, after payment of the freight rate.\r\n\r\nThese two principles of cost of service and value of service are\r\ndirectly opposed in one regard; inasmuch as the cost of service theory\r\nharks directly back to railway expenditure; while the value of service\r\nprinciple contemplates primarily the effect upon the railway's income\r\naccount. Any charge is justified according to the latter view, which\r\nis not detrimental to the shipper as indicated by a positive reduction\r\nin the volume of business offered. No charge, on the other hand, may\r\nbe deemed reasonable according to the cost of service principle,\r\nwhich affords more than a fair profit upon the business, regardless\r\nof its effect upon the shipper. As a matter of fact neither of these\r\nviews is entirely sound by itself. Both have large elements of truth\r\nin them. Each qualifies the other. In the first place, it is to be\r\nnoted that between them they fix the upper and lower limits of all\r\npossible charges. Less than the cost of service cannot be charged;\r\nelse would a confiscatory rate result. This was the plea set up by\r\nthe railways in the now celebrated Texas Cattle Raisers' Association\r\ncase against the cancellation by the Interstate Commerce Commission\r\nof an extra charge of $1 per car for switching charges at Chicago. At\r\nthe other extreme, more than the traffic will bear cannot be charged\r\nwithout a disproportionate decline in volume of tonnage. This would\r\nbe bad business policy, as it could at once entail loss of revenue.\r\nThe railway could not submit to the former alternative; it would not\r\nconceivably resort to the latter.\r\n\r\nAttempts have been made by various authors to account for the phenomena\r\nof rate making on other grounds. The German author, Sax, has sought to\r\ntrace an analogy between the imposition of taxes and railway charges,\r\nalleging that both should be proportioned to what the shipper \"can\r\nafford to pay,\" from an ethical rather than an economic point of view.\r\nAcworth interprets the phrase \"charging what the traffic will bear\" to\r\nmean something analogous to this. His allegation is that rate schedules\r\nare built up upon the principle of \"equality of sacrifice,\" otherwise\r\ncharacterized as \"tempering the wind to the shorn lamb.\" High class\r\ntraffic contributes liberally of its abundance of value, while third\r\nclass passengers and low grade tonnage are let off lightly on the\r\nground of their poverty. Taussig in his memorable contribution to the\r\nsubject[139] has, however, shown how untenable this theory of \"equality\r\nof sacrifice\" is. Not ethical but purely economic considerations are\r\napplicable in such circumstances except, of course, in so far as common\r\ncarriers, enjoying privileges by grant of the state, may be considered\r\nas imposing taxes for the performance of a quasi-public duty. This\r\nlatter test of a reasonable rate has underlaid a long line of Supreme\r\nCourt decisions since the Granger case.[140] Nevertheless, as so\r\nfrequently happens, legal and economic bases of judgment seem to be\r\nlacking in harmony.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question that for an indispensable public service\r\nlike transportation, conducted under monopolistic conditions, the\r\nideal system of charges would be to ascertain the cost of each service\r\nrendered and to allow a reasonable margin of profit over and above this\r\namount. To the application of this principle alone, however, there are\r\nseveral insuperable objections both theoretical and practical. Such\r\ncost is practically indeterminate, being joint for all services in\r\nlarge part, as we have seen: it is highly variable, being perhaps never\r\ntwice the same, as circumstances change from time to time; cost is\r\nunknown until volume is ascertained, and volume is ever fluctuating;\r\nthe cost of service, obviously, could never be ascertained until after\r\nthe service had been rendered, while, of course, the schedule of rates\r\nmust be known in advance, in order that the shipper may calculate his\r\nprobable profits; and finally the principle of increasing returns,\r\nflowing from the dependence of cost upon volume of traffic, imposes\r\nsuch an incentive for development of new business, which in turn\r\ndepends for its volume upon the rate charged, that cost of service is\r\nsubordinated at once to other considerations in practice.\r\n\r\nOf these objections to rate making upon the principle of cost of\r\nservice alone, it would indeed appear as if the first should be\r\nconclusive. If the cost is simply indeterminable, why bother about any\r\nfurther refutation of the principle at all? But the persistency of the\r\nidea that somehow railway operations are analogous to the business of\r\nan ordinary merchant; and that cost and profits are ascertainable;\r\nrenders it necessary to pile proof upon proof of the limitations upon\r\nits applicability to real conditions in service.\r\n\r\nNot only is the mere cost of service indeterminable; if it could\r\nbe ascertained, it would not establish the chargeable rate in many\r\ninstances. The freight service of a railway comprises the carriage of\r\nall kinds of goods simultaneously, from the most valuable high-priced\r\ncommodities, such as silks and satins, down to lumber, coal, cement,\r\nand even sand.[141] To compel each of these classes of goods to bear\r\nits proportionate share of the cost of carriage, would at once preclude\r\nthe possibility of transporting low-priced goods at all. One dollar a\r\nhundred pounds may not be too much to add to the price of boots and\r\nshoes for transportation from Boston to Chicago.\r\n\r\nIt would still form only a small part of the total cost of producing\r\nand marketing them. But to add anything like that sum to the cost of\r\none hundred pounds of salt or cement would put an end to the business\r\nat once. Only about so much can in practice be added to the price of\r\nany given commodity for freight without widely limiting the area of its\r\navailable market. Thus raw cotton seems to be able to bear an addition\r\nof about fifty cents per hundred pounds for freight to its total cost.\r\nExperience demonstrates that anything more than this one-half cent per\r\npound charged on cotton, entails more loss than gain. In the case of\r\nfancy groceries or fine furniture, there may be no considerable demand\r\nin any event above a certain ascertainable level of prices. For boots\r\nand shoes or cut building stone it may be that competition from some\r\nother centre of production nearby, precludes any great addition to\r\nthe price for freight. The business simply will not bear more than a\r\ncertain proportion of charge. Not only would the rigid application of\r\nthe cost of service principle hinder all transportation of low-grade\r\ntraffic; it would also prevent any development of long distance\r\nbusiness. It is indubitable that sole reliance upon cost of service as\r\na basis for rate making is theoretically unsound, and impossible of\r\npractical application.[142]\r\n\r\nCost of service, while unsound as a sole reliance, nevertheless affords\r\nan important check upon the value of service principle. Without it\r\nthere is always grave danger that traffic managers, seeking to enlarge\r\ntheir revenues, may push rates unreasonably high. At first sight it\r\nwould appear as if this could not occur, inasmuch as an inordinately\r\nhigh rate would immediately reduce the volume of business offered.\r\nIt is constantly alleged by railway men that this must of necessity\r\noccur. And it would indeed follow, were it not that the incidence of\r\nthe rate is rarely upon the actual shipper. He merely pays it, and at\r\nonce shifts it to the consumer. For low-grade or staple goods like\r\ncement or kerosene, where transportation charges form a large part of\r\nthe total cost of production, it is conceivable that higher freight\r\nrates might so far increase the price as to check consumption. Five\r\ncents a hundredweight higher freight means $1.25 per 1,000 ft. added\r\nto the price of soft lumber, $2 to hard lumber; three cents per bushel\r\nadded to the price of wheat, and $1 to the ton of pig iron or coal.\r\nSuch substantial additions might readily reduce the demand. Yet even\r\nthis would not be true of necessities of life like anthracite coal\r\nor sugar, on which latter the freight rate amounts to about one-half\r\ncent per pound. Is five cents a barrel added to the price of flour\r\nlikely to decrease the consumption of that staple commodity? Yet the\r\nenhancement of railway revenues would indeed be enormous from such an\r\nincrease of freight rates. For these necessities of life, an increased\r\nfreight rate might become an actual charge upon the people, without\r\nreducing their consumption, like a tax upon salt. Only upon goods the\r\nuse of which might be freely lessened, would higher freight rates\r\nbe reflected in a corresponding decline in the volume of business.\r\nMoreover, with all high grade traffic, the value of service principle\r\nfails utterly by itself alone to prescribe the upper level of a\r\nreasonable charge. Competent testimony is ample upon this point. Thus\r\nfrom the commissioner of the Trunk Line Association;[143] \"The tonnage\r\nof the higher class articles is an extremely difficult matter for\r\ntransportation companies to increase or decrease.... In that class of\r\narticles the carrier can do but little to increase the transportation.\"\r\nAnd the reason in part lies in the almost immediate diffusion of the\r\nburden in the processes of distribution. That no complaints are made--a\r\ndefence often brought forward for higher rates--proves by itself the\r\nuncertain incidence of the burden imposed.\r\n\r\nThat the principle of charging what the traffic will bear affords\r\nno protection to the consumer against exorbitant rates on many\r\ncommodities, follows also from the relative insignificance of\r\ntransportation charges as compared with the value of the goods. This,\r\nin fact, is naively conceded by railway managers themselves; when,\r\nas in the case of the widespread freight rate advances of 1908-1909,\r\npublicity agents flooded the country with calculations as to the\r\ninfinitesimal fraction which would be added to the price of commodities\r\nby a ten per cent, rise in rates.[144] The rate from Grand Rapids to\r\nChicago on an ordinary dining room set of furniture, being $1.60, a\r\nten per cent. increase would add only sixteen cents to the cost. A\r\nharvester transported one hundred miles would be enhanced seventeen\r\nand a half cents in price; a kitchen stove carried from Detroit to\r\nthe Mississippi would only cost twenty-five cents more; and the price\r\nof a Michigan refrigerator sold in New York, would be only seven\r\nand one-half cents higher; were freight rates to be increased by\r\nten per cent, in each instance. On wearing apparel the proportions\r\nwere represented as even more striking. An ordinary suit of clothes\r\ntransported three hundred miles, under similarly enhanced rates, would,\r\nit was alleged, cost only one-third of a cent more. For all their\r\napparel, made in New England, consisting of everything from hats to\r\nshoes, each wearer in the Middle West would be affected by a ten per\r\ncent. rise of rates by less than one cent apiece. True enough all this;\r\nand a striking testimonial to the effectiveness of the railway service\r\nof the country! But at the same time, if a ten per cent. increase of\r\nrates is inappreciable to the consumer, why not increase them by twenty\r\nper cent.[145]\r\n\r\nAnd what becomes of the argument that charging rates according to\r\nwhat the traffic will bear, is an ample safeguard against extortion?\r\nMany of these small changes in price are diffused in the friction of\r\nretail trade;[146] some of them are unfortunately magnified to the\r\nconsumer, especially under conditions of monopoly. When freight rates\r\non beef go up ten cents per hundredweight, the consumers' price is more\r\nlikely than not to rise by ten times that amount. But even assuming\r\nthe final cost to follow the range of transportation charges closely,\r\nis it not evident that, so small relatively are many freight charges\r\nby comparison with other costs of production, that consumption is\r\nnot proportionately affected by their movement one way or the other?\r\nAnd yet the entire argument that the value of service principle is a\r\nself-governing engine against unreasonable rates, is based upon this\r\nassumption. Surely the increased income to the carriers when rates are\r\nraised must come from someone. Because it is not felt, is no reason for\r\ndenying its existence as a tax. But the very fact that it is not felt,\r\nundermines the argument that a safeguard against extortion obtains. The\r\ntheorem that value of service in itself affords a reliable basis for\r\nrate making, pre-supposes that freight rates and prices move in unison;\r\na supposition which a moment's consideration shows to be untenable\r\nin fact.[147] Such cases must be finally settled by some reference,\r\nindefinite though it be, to the cost of conducting that particular\r\nservice; or rather, as Lorenz puts it, to the extra cost incident to\r\nthat service. This extra cost may oftentimes be segregated, where the\r\ntotal cost could not be ascertained.[148]\r\n\r\nThat the problem is, however, a most difficult one is evidenced by the\r\nperiodic controversies over railway mail pay.[149]\r\n\r\nOf course in order that any change of rates should be reflected in\r\nprices, all carriers must of necessity agree upon the matter. The price\r\nis made by the least expensive source of supply. So that any carrier\r\nrefusing to raise rates, might aid in the continuance of an already\r\nestablished price. Under conditions of transportation prevalent in\r\nthe United States twenty years ago, the likelihood of an increased\r\nfreight rate becoming a tax upon the community, was lessened by the\r\nprobability that either by means of secret rebates, or by special\r\nand perhaps open commodity rates, some roads might choose to protect\r\ntheir clients against enhancement of prices. Markets were local--not\r\nreached by great systems operating from remote sources of supply.\r\nThe policy of the northern transcontinental lines in making lumber\r\nrates from Oregon to the Middle West, might be quite independent of\r\nany policy in force on the southern hard pine carrying roads. But\r\nunder present day conditions, the entire area of the United States is\r\none great market. Hence, with rebates eliminated and with practical\r\nmonopoly established through actual consolidation, control or harmony\r\nof policy, the carriers have the consumers much more completely at\r\ntheir mercy. Only two safeguards for the public interest remain. One is\r\ngovernment regulation, or at all events supervision, of charges. The\r\nother is \"enlightened self-interest\"--which in transportation matters\r\nmeans a full appreciation of the possibilities and limitations in the\r\napplication of the value of service principle to the determination of\r\nrates.\r\n\r\nConsiderations of cost of service afford protection, not only against\r\nunreasonably high rates, but also against unduly low charges. The evil\r\nin such cases is not only that the carriers operate at a loss, but that\r\ninequality and discrimination are inevitable concomitants of too low\r\nrates. No railway conceivably, of course, will charge unremunerative\r\nrates for a long time. But it sometimes happens that managements may be\r\nled to the adoption of policies of temporary expediency, not compatible\r\nwith the long-time welfare of stockholders. During the presidency of\r\nCharles Francis Adams on the Northern Pacific in 1890 an unaccountable\r\nand unnatural diversion of traffic from this road to the Atchison,\r\nTopeka & Santa Fe suddenly occurred.[150] A large volume of freight\r\nfrom the East to Oregon was diverted to the roundabout route _via_\r\nSouthern California. On investigation it appeared that the English\r\nbanking house of Baring Brothers, having become involved in unfortunate\r\nArgentine speculation, and being obliged to force a market for its\r\ninvestments in Atchison securities, demanded an immediate showing of\r\nlarge gross earnings regardless of the net profits. Orders to get\r\ntraffic at any price went forth. A market was made for Atchison stock;\r\nalthough it was powerless to prevent the firm's final bankruptcy.\r\nIn such a case the only safeguard against unreasonably depressed\r\nrates by the Atchison road, which, of course, immediately compelled\r\ncorresponding reductions by the natural routes to the Northwest, should\r\nhave been consideration of the actual cost of moving traffic by so\r\nlong and roundabout a route. And yet this consideration was entirely\r\nignored. Another illustration of the same danger occurred in April,\r\n1903.[151] A gang of western speculators unobtrusively acquired control\r\nof the Louisville & Nashville road, by taking advantage of the issue\r\nby that company of a large amount of new stock. This they did by the\r\nuse of borrowed money. They had no intention, even had they been\r\nsufficiently well financed to do so, of permanently controlling the\r\nroad as an investment. They bought the stock merely in order to resell\r\nit at a higher figure. They threatened the railway world with a general\r\ndisturbance of rate conditions throughout the South. Their plan was\r\nto cut rates and steal traffic from other roads in order to make a\r\nlarge show of gross earnings; and to unload their stock holdings on\r\nthe market thus made, before the public learned the truth. This was\r\nprevented only by repurchase of their stock at very high prices. In\r\nsuch a case, what guidance would the principle of charging what the\r\ntraffic would bear, afford? Cost of service must be invoked in order to\r\ndetermine the reasonableness of the low rates in force.\r\n\r\nIn any industry where rates are made under conditions of monopoly\r\nrather than of free competition, it is imperative that cost of service\r\nbe constantly held in view. Under conditions of free competition it\r\nis bound to obtrude itself automatically; but under monopoly it must\r\noftentimes be forcibly invoked. The shipper whose manufacturing plant\r\nhas once been located in a certain place is no longer free to accept or\r\nreject a certain rate. He can afford neither to move nor to abandon his\r\nworks. In order to continue in business he must meet the prices made\r\nby competitors. This price may be made elsewhere under more favored\r\ncircumstances. To a manufacturer an increase of freight rates instead\r\nof curtailing output, may lead to attempts to lessen the costs of\r\nproduction per unit by an enlarged output sold at cut prices. Under\r\nsuch conditions an enhanced freight rate is a positive deduction from\r\nprofits without any gain to the consumer. It is impossible to trace any\r\nsafeguard against extortion in the operations of a value of service\r\nlaw under such circumstances. An instance in point is afforded by a\r\ncomplaint of the Detroit Chemical works in 1908.[152] This company\r\nimported iron pyrites through Baltimore from Spain; that being the\r\nsource of the bulk of the material used here in the manufacture of\r\nsulphuric acid. The Detroit Company sold its product throughout the\r\nWest in competition with companies at St. Louis, Chicago and Buffalo.\r\nThe companies at Chicago and St. Louis enjoyed low import rates by way\r\nof the Gulf ports. The Buffalo concern used to be favored by a low rate\r\nsaid to be due to canal competition on shipments from New York. Since\r\n1903, however, the rate on pyrites from Baltimore to Detroit had been\r\nsteadily increasing, from $1.56 to $2.72 per long ton. Even this latter\r\nrate by itself does not seem absolutely excessive, yielding a revenue\r\nof less than four mills per ton mile. But here again, it was not the\r\nabsolute but the relative rate upon which the continued welfare of the\r\nindustrial concern depended. The question had to be decided, not on the\r\nbasis of cost, but from the point of view of the value of the service\r\nto the user. The carriers after this petition was filed voluntarily\r\nreduced the rate fifty-one cents per ton in January, 1908. The relative\r\nrate as compared with that to other competitive points was thus more\r\nequitably adjusted. The Interstate Commerce Commission on a review of\r\nthe evidence held that this increase to $2.72 was unreasonable and\r\nunjust so long as it had been in effect; and awarded reparation to the\r\namount of fifty-one cents per ton on all shipments made during its\r\ncontinuance.\r\n\r\nIt is indisputable that the great dynamic force in railway operation\r\ninheres in the value of service idea. The traffic manager who is always\r\nconsidering how much it will cost to handle business, will seldom\r\nadventure into new territory. The United States, as a rapidly growing\r\ncountry, is consequently the field in which charging what the traffic\r\nwill bear, has been most ardently upheld as the only practicable basis\r\nfor rate making. A few detailed illustrations will serve to show\r\nthe results of its application in practice. Not infrequently does\r\nit happen that rates are different over the same line for shipments\r\nbetween two given points in opposite directions. Where this is due\r\nto a preponderance of traffic in one direction, and a consequent\r\nmovement of \"empties\" which invite a back loading at very low rates,\r\nthe difference of charges according to direction may actually be due to\r\ndifferences in the cost of carriage.[153] An empty train, which must\r\nbe returned from New York to Chicago for another loading of grain,\r\nor to Georgia or Oregon for shipments of lumber, if loaded with\r\nmerchandise, can be moved with no allowance for dead weight of cars\r\nor locomotives; inasmuch as the train must move in any event, whether\r\nloaded or empty. But even where this defence of difference in the cost\r\nof service fails, the practice may be entirely proper from every point\r\nof view. By increasing the total tonnage a special rate may ultimately\r\ncontribute to lower charges all along the line. Raisin culture began in\r\nCalifornia in 1876. Prior to that time the Spanish product had supplied\r\nthe American market. The first thing to do was to find a market for\r\nthe California raisins in the East. They would not bear the freight\r\nrate which had previously been charged for Spanish raisins moving over\r\nthe transcontinental lines westward. A very low rate was all that the\r\nnew traffic would bear. During the year 1876 therefore 70,000 lbs. of\r\nCalifornia raisins were carried east at one and three-fourths cents\r\nper 100 lbs., while simultaneously 1,000,000 lbs. of Spanish raisins\r\nwere carried west over the same lines at a rate of three cents. No\r\nsuch difference in the cost of service in opposite directions existed,\r\nalthough a preponderance of empties moving eastward undoubtedly\r\ncheapened the service from California. The aim of the commodity rate\r\nwas to upbuild a new industry. How far this succeeded appears from the\r\nfact that in 1891, no Spanish raisins were carried west at all; while\r\nthe eastbound shipments amounted to 37,600,000 lbs.[154] The preceding\r\nillustration leads us then to this further conclusion. The cost of\r\nservice principle might most conceivably be applied to a railway in\r\na purely static state. But, dynamically considered, as involving the\r\ngrowth and development of business, it fails utterly by itself to meet\r\nthe necessities of the case.\r\n\r\nAt times it is inevitable that cost of service and value of service\r\nconsiderations come flatly into opposition. Usually, as in the\r\nCalifornia raisin case or in the grant of low rates on Oregon lumber\r\neast bound about 1893, they reinforce one another; that is to say,\r\nthe lower rate given to build up business obtains on a service given\r\nat lower cost. But it sometimes happens that shipments of the same\r\ncommodities over a line in opposite directions may occur and that the\r\nlower rate applies to the (presumably) more costly service. In 1906 a\r\nmanufacturer in Menasha, Wis., complained to the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission[155] that his rates on woodenware to the Pacific slope\r\nwere ten cents per 100 lbs. higher than were rates on the same goods\r\nbetween the same points east bound, _notwithstanding_ the fact that the\r\nempty car mileage west bound was then three times as great as in the\r\ncontrary direction. The movement of empties west bound would certainly\r\nseem to justify as low if not lower rates on the basis of comparative\r\ncost of operation, supposing that there was coincidence in time.\r\nOnly one satisfactory explanation for this apparent anomaly suggests\r\nitself; viz., that this low eastbound rate was given to build up a new\r\nindustry in the West. In other words, the cost of service, a dependable\r\nguide for a road in a static condition, failed of effect upon a line\r\npossessed of great dynamic possibilities. Occasionally opposition of\r\nprinciples like this may occur in questions of classification. It may\r\ntemporarily be worth while, in order to build up a new industry, to\r\naccord a lower rating to a commodity actually more valuable or more\r\nexpensive to handle than others. Here again the dynamic force in the\r\nvalue of service principle out-weighs all other considerations of\r\nrelative cost of service.\r\n\r\nThe value of service principle in general fails, not only in the\r\ndetermination of absolutely reasonable rates, but it is inadequate\r\nalso to the solution of perhaps the more difficult problem of relative\r\nrates. This question of relativity is twofold; first as between\r\ndifferent places, and secondly as between different commodities.\r\nThese are, in other words, the problems respectively of distance\r\ntariffs and of classification. The manner in which distance tariffs\r\nevolve, has already been discussed, and it is evident that the cost\r\nof service principle is of fundamental importance, even though it be\r\ntempered by considerations of commercial expediency, that is to say,\r\nby the necessity of at all times under stress of competition, charging\r\nonly what the traffic will bear. But while the value of service\r\nprinciple--charging according to demand in other words--applies at the\r\ncompetitive points, the other principle of relative cost should be the\r\nfundamental one in fixing upon the scale of local non-competitive rates.\r\n\r\nThe second phase of the problem of relativity arises in connection\r\nwith classification.[156] How shall goods be graded in respect of\r\ntheir freight charges for identical services in carriage? Besides\r\nillustrating the interplay of the two fundamental principles, this\r\ntopic serves also to clear up another possible confusion of terms.\r\nProportioning transportation charges to the value of the service must\r\nalways be clearly distinguished from basing them upon the mere value\r\nof the goods. Nothing is more certain than that no direct causal\r\nrelation between freight rates and the intrinsic value of commodities\r\nis traceable. On wire the freight rate between two given points may\r\nbe about one-fourth of the commercial value; on sheet iron one-third;\r\non lumber somewhat more, and on hay two-fifths; while on cattle and\r\nhogs the freight rate may range as low as one-tenth to one-eighth of\r\ntheir commercial value. On coal, on the other hand, the freight rate\r\noften more than equals the price of the coal at the mine, and on very\r\nlow grade commodities like bricks, the transportation charges may\r\nequal two or even three times the worth of the goods.[157] For each\r\nlocality or even direction, these percentages will change. Positive\r\nreasons for these varying relationships are discernible in local trade\r\nconditions. While in general cheap goods are rated lower; if for any\r\nreason--bulkiness or risk--they cost relatively more to transport,\r\nthey may very properly be advanced in grade. Normally, raw products\r\nmove at lower rates than finished products--for instance, wheat and\r\nflour or cattle and beef. This is in accord with charging what the\r\ntraffic will bear in relation to value. But in the making of export\r\nrates, it may be to the interest of the carrier to reverse this order,\r\nactually according to the finished product the lower rate, thereby\r\nencouraging the development of manufactures at home rather than\r\nabroad.[158] Classification committees and regulative commissions are\r\nthus compelled to waver between the two opposing considerations of cost\r\nand value. One cannot avoid the conclusion, however, that, contrary\r\nto the usual rule, in this field of classification undue weight is\r\noften accorded by railway managers to that small element of total\r\ncost of service arising from risks of damage in transit--insurance\r\ncost, in other words--to the neglect of the financially more important\r\nconsideration of what the traffic will bear. This emphasis upon the\r\ncost side of the account by classification committees, oddly enough is\r\npeculiarly characteristic of ratings in the higher class commodities.\r\nAmong low grade goods, like grain, lumber or coal, the risk of damage\r\nis small, so that insurance cost becomes almost negligible. The\r\ninsistent consideration among these low grade commodities is much more\r\napt to be that of relative demand; arising from the necessity of close\r\nand constant adjustment to the behests of trade. Special or commodity\r\nrates, based directly upon what the traffic will bear, rather than upon\r\nthe element of cost, are likely to prevail in these cases. But the very\r\nlarge revenue which could be obtained from increasing the rates upon\r\nthe higher grade of goods seems not to be fully appreciated.\r\n\r\nA valuable instance of the play of opposing considerations of cost and\r\nvalue of service in the classification of freight rates is afforded by\r\nthe complaint in 1908 of the pulp paper makers in Wisconsin, already\r\ncited in another connection.[159] It appeared that for similar service\r\nover the same roads, the rates per carload on saw logs for lumber were\r\nonly about one-half those charged for carriage of logs to be ground\r\ninto paper pulp. Judged on the basis of commercial value, hemlock and\r\nspruce bolts, too short and often otherwise unfit for lumber, were\r\nworth much less than saw logs; and yet they paid double the freight\r\nrates. This was not because the pulp wood was less desirable as\r\ntraffic. In many ways it was more so. The haul was twice as long as for\r\nsaw logs. The paper mills brought relatively more supplementary tonnage\r\nin the form of coal, food stuffs and supplies for workmen and their\r\nfamilies. Fully as much of the finished product to be reshipped to\r\nconsumers resulted. While smaller in volume, the pulp wood business was\r\nfar more permanent. It was growing rapidly while the lumber business\r\nwas declining. Moreover, the actual cost of service in hauling pulp\r\nwood was fully as low as for lumber logs. Carloads were much heavier,\r\nand were more regular in movement. In practice they involved no\r\nmilling-in-transit obligation, that is to say, no obligation to re-ship\r\nthe finished paper out over the same road; while all the saw log rates\r\ncarried this obligation--a matter of some moment to the railways. And\r\nfinally the value of the service to shippers of pulp wood was less than\r\nto mere lumbermen; in other words, the paper makers were operating\r\nunder closer margins of profit; their plants were more costly, and\r\ndepreciated more rapidly. The defence of the carriers in this case was\r\nnot that the rates on pulp wood were too high in themselves, but that\r\nthe rate on saw logs was perhaps unduly low--the latter having been\r\ncrowded down to a minimum figure by competition in the early days of\r\nthe business by the lumber raftsmen who floated the saw logs downstream\r\nfrom the forest to the saw mills. But of equal importance probably in\r\nperpetuating the higher rates on pulp logs, was the assumption that\r\nwhile the value of the bolts themselves was perhaps even less than\r\nthat of saw logs, the value of the resultant product, paper, was much\r\ngreater than that of lumber. But the Wisconsin Railroad Commission, in\r\nentire harmony with the principle repeatedly laid down by the Federal\r\ncommission, held that the carriers must be guided by real distinctions\r\nof cost from a transportation standpoint and not by gradations\r\nof value. If the goods were bulky, awkward, or risky to handle,\r\nperhaps requiring special appliances or equipment, relatively high\r\nclassification was permissible. But if they were substantially similar\r\nfor purposes of carriage, no gradation in rates based upon differences\r\nin the ultimate uses to which the commodity might be put would be\r\nupheld. Such was the reasoning of the Interstate Commerce Commission\r\nin a decision, holding that fire, building and paving brick must be\r\naccorded equal rates, regardless of their differing values.[160]\r\nThat the element of value is, however, not negligible is brought out\r\nin a later Federal case,[161] wherein it was recommended that cheap\r\nchina, to be given away as premiums in the tea trade, be rated nearer\r\nordinary crockery or earthenware, even though shipped in the same\r\nmanner as high grade china ware. Under the official classification,\r\nchinaware is rated first class if in boxes, and second class in casks.\r\nEarthenware or crockery is carried at twenty per cent, less than third\r\nclass, in small packages (L. C. L.). On the basis of mere cost of\r\nservice, it would seem as if boxes of chinaware should have a lower\r\nrating than casks. Boxes stow better than casks, with less risk of\r\nbreakage. But the commercial practice being to ship the finer grades\r\nof chinaware in boxes, such shipments are graded higher because the\r\ntraffic will usually bear a higher rate. Thus considerations of cost of\r\nservice yield to those of value. The Interstate Commerce Commission,\r\nhowever, noting the exceptional circumstances under which the tea\r\ncompany distributed its cheap chinaware, recommended a revision of the\r\nclassification to meet the needs of the case; in other words ordering\r\na greater emphasis upon the elements of the value of the service, even\r\nat the expense of relative cost of operation.\r\n\r\nOur final conclusion, then, must be this: That both principles are of\r\nequal importance; and that both must be continually invoked as a check\r\nupon each other. The tendency to the elevation of cost of service to\r\na position of priority--rather characteristic of regulative bodies\r\nand of legislators--is no less erroneous than the marked disposition\r\nof railway managers to insist upon the universal applicability of\r\nthe principle of charging what the traffic will bear. Neither will\r\nstand the test of reasonableness alone. Whether the one or the other\r\nshould take precedence can only be determined by a careful study of\r\nthe circumstance and conditions in each case; and in practice, the\r\ninstances where either principle becomes of binding effect to the\r\nentire exclusion of the other, are extremely rare.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[119] 13 I.C.C.

I am speaking now of when I was a railroad man.\r\n    Here is quite a grain point in Iowa, where there are five or\r\n    six elevators. As a railroad man, I would try and hold all\r\n    those dealers on a 'level keel,' and give them all the same\r\n    tariff rate. But suppose there was a road five or six or eight\r\n    miles across the country, and those dealers should begin to\r\n    drop in on me every day or two and tell me that that road\r\n    across the country was reaching within a mile or two of our\r\n    station and drawing to itself all the grain. You might say that\r\n    it would be the just and right thing to do to give all the five\r\n    or six dealers at this station a special rate to meet that\r\n    competition through the country. But, as a railroad man, I can\r\n    accomplish the purpose better by picking out one good, smart,\r\n    live man, and, giving him a concession of three or four cents\r\n    a hundred, let him go there and scoop the business. I would\r\n    get the tonnage, and that is what I want. But if I give it to\r\n    the five it is known in a very short time. I can illustrate\r\n    that better by a story told by Mr. Vanderbilt when he and his\r\n    broker had a deal in stocks. The broker came in and said, 'Mr.\r\n    Vanderbilt, I would like to take in my friend John Smith.' Mr.\r\n    Vanderbilt said, 'Let us see how this will work. Here are you\r\n    and myself in this deal now. We take in John Smith; that makes\r\n    a hundred and eleven. I guess I won't do it.' When you take in\r\n    these people at the station on a private rebate you might as\r\n    well make it public and lose what you intend to accomplish. You\r\n    can take hold of one man and build him up at the expense of the\r\n    others, and the railroad will get the tonnage.\"\r\n\r\n    \"SENATOR HARRIS. The effect is to build that one man up and\r\n    destroy the others?\"\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. WICKER. Yes, sir; but it accomplishes the purposes of the\r\n    road better than to build up the six.\"\r\n\r\nThe force of this description of the underlying motive for personal\r\ndiscrimination, so far as the carrier is concerned; namely to build\r\nup one man at the expense of his competitors and to attach him in\r\ninterest indissolubly to the company, is well exemplified in a case\r\nwhich occurred in 1908 at Galveston, Texas.[162] Practically all\r\nrailway traffic entering Galveston was destined for export. Wharfage\r\nfacilities were limited to two concerns, one of them being the Southern\r\nPacific Terminal Co. A uniform charge of one cent per hundredweight for\r\ncotton seed meal and cake passing over the wharves of both companies\r\nhad been the rule for a long time. Yet it appeared on complaint that\r\none merchant had been granted wharfage space under discriminatingly\r\nfavorable conditions. Exemption from demurrage charges, free storage\r\nroom and other favors and a fixed rental of $15,000 per year\r\nirrespective of the amount of his shipments, had enabled him, having\r\nbeen in business only since 1898, to build up a very large traffic. The\r\nexport of cotton seed cake instead of meal had greatly increased since\r\n1904. The business of all other competitors since this contract was\r\nmade had shrunk to insignificant proportions by comparison with that\r\ndone by this favored merchant. The margin of profit in the business\r\nwas so small that the difference between the charges and privileges\r\nenjoyed by this individual and his competitors, was forcing them all\r\nout of business. It was estimated by the Interstate Commerce Commission\r\nthat if the customary wharfage charges had been paid, the rental would\r\nhave been nearly $30,000 for the year 1907, irrespective of other\r\nfavors. The cotton planters complained also that this monopoly limited\r\ntheir market and depressed business. It is clear that the larger the\r\nbusiness, that is to say the more nearly it became a monopoly, the\r\nsmaller became the wharfage charges per hundredweight under this system\r\nof a fixed rental; and, in consequence, the greater was the disability\r\nof the other shippers. The advantage to the railroad appeared in\r\na contract entered into, which provided that all traffic for this\r\nindividual should be routed over the Southern Pacific or its connecting\r\nlines. As he had practically gathered in all the cotton seed export\r\nbusiness of Texas and the adjoining states within two years, it is\r\nevident that this consideration was of great value to the railroad. The\r\neconomic motive in this case and in the one previously cited was the\r\nsame. It will be found in fact to underlie almost all cases of personal\r\nfavoritism and discrimination.\r\n\r\nThe supreme disadvantage in building up a great monopoly in order to\r\nwin traffic for a railroad is, of course, that the moment the shipper\r\nbecomes sufficiently powerful, he can play off one road against\r\nanother, thus becoming practically master of the situation. Sindbad is\r\nsoon overwhelmed by the old man of the sea. And the weaker the road\r\nfinancially, the more powerful is the appeal, to which at last even the\r\nstrongest lines must succumb. The history of the Standard Oil Company\r\nduring the eighties clearly exemplifies this. The rapid rise of the\r\ncattle \"eveners\" yet earlier, until, as the private refrigerator car\r\ncompanies they controlled the situation, was primarily traceable to the\r\nsame causes. The late J. W. Midgly[163] gives a forcible illustration\r\nin the attempt in 1894 of ninety-five railroads to reduce the mileage\r\nallowance paid for use of oil tank cars owned by private companies\r\nfrom three-fourths to one-half cent per mile, loaded and empty. The\r\nUnion Tank Line promptly replied that it would in that event at once\r\nconcentrate all its vast tonnage to points north and west of Chicago,\r\nupon the single line--presumably the weakest one--which would continue\r\nthe old rate. This argument was irresistible; and in the old days of\r\nunregulated competition was in the nature of things bound to be so.\r\n\r\nCareful distinction must be made at this point, between personal\r\ndiscrimination and general rate cutting. Rebating,--that is to\r\nsay, departure from published tariffs,--occurs in both cases. The\r\ndifference between the two is that in the one case it is special,\r\nparticular and secret; while in the other it is so general, if not\r\nindeed universal, as to be matter of common knowledge. Rebating, in\r\nother words, is a common feature of rate wars. But, on the other hand,\r\ngeneral harmony in the rate situation by no means implies the absence\r\nof personal favoritism. During a wide-open rate war, indeed, the most\r\niniquitous aspect of rebating,--inequality of treatment as between\r\nrival shippers,--may be quite absent. All may be getting the same\r\nrate, namely a cut rate; although the chances are of course that the\r\nbigger the shipper, the more substantial the concessions offered. It is\r\nimportant to keep this distinction clear, especially since the railways\r\nhave awakened to the losses to themselves attendant upon rate wars.\r\n\r\nAll parties concerned are probably agreed in the hope of eliminating\r\nthe rate war forever. But there is not the same evidence of either\r\nan intent or desire on the part of railway officials to get rid of\r\nwhat, from a public point of view, is even more insidious and unjust;\r\nthat is to say, the secret concession of favors to a few chosen large\r\nshippers. General rate wars, as will later appear, are probably a thing\r\nof the past.[164] But secret rebating seems, on the other hand, to be\r\nan evil which must be combatted vigorously and un-intermittently in\r\norder to uproot it as a feature of American industrial life. And of\r\ncourse it must cease. For it is the most prolific source of evil known\r\nin transportation. It has probably had more to do with the creation\r\nof great industrial monopolies than any other single factor. The first\r\nfeature of any reform of our intolerable \"trust\" situation, must be to\r\nkeep the rails open on absolutely even terms to all shippers, large or\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nThe keynote of discrimination is, as we have said, the creation of\r\nmonopoly, or, at all events, of so large an aggregation of shipments,\r\nthat a profitable partnership between the shipper and the railroad\r\nresults. This is clear in recent indictments which charge that the\r\nrailroads concerned, having selected one large firm of forwarders in\r\nNew York and Chicago are giving them a monopoly in respect of all\r\nimports. In the case of the great beef packers, the railroad having\r\nonce built up a shipper by favored rates, may continue in the enjoyment\r\nof this concentrated tonnage with greater security and profit than if\r\nit moved in a multitude of small shipments by numerous competitors. Of\r\ncourse there is another less common form of rebating which, so far as\r\nits profit is concerned, is limited to the particular dishonest railway\r\nofficial who arranges the matter. Such favoritism as this, however,\r\nrepresents a loss to the company; and has always been stamped out by\r\nthe carriers when discovered. The principal form above described,\r\nis much more difficult to uproot. And yet for some reason, it is a\r\ndistinctively American abuse. European countries seem never to have\r\nsuffered from it, to any such degree as has the United States. It is,\r\nas has just been said, perhaps the most iniquitous, the most persistent\r\nand until very recently the most nearly ineradicable evil connected\r\nwith the great business of transportation.\r\n\r\nRebating in the early days consisted in simply refunding by direct\r\npayment to the favored shipper, a certain proportion of the freight\r\nbill. This refund might be in cash, in presents to himself or his\r\nfamily, in salary allowances to clerks, in free passes, or in free\r\ntransportation of other goods. In a recent case in New York it has\r\ntaken the form of importer's \"commissions.\" But, since 1887 at least,\r\nan inconvenience in all such transactions is their necessary entry\r\nin some form or other upon the books of the company. Of course such\r\nrebates could be covered up as a fictitious charge to operating\r\nexpenses; or, as in the case of the Atchison in 1893, might be\r\ncarried as an asset, as if such refunds would ever be paid. Nearly\r\n$4,000,000 was thus entered as padding in Atchison assets, when it\r\nwent into a receiver's hands at that time.[165] Much of the flagrant\r\nStandard Oil rebating in the eighties was almost openly, and certainly\r\nboldly, carried on by these means. But public sentiment was always\r\nagainst it; and of course, it was a breach of good faith as between\r\nthe railways themselves, in their endeavor to maintain agreed rates.\r\nSecrecy, therefore, always attaches to these transactions; and the most\r\ningenious devices were invented to confer favors without detection.\r\n\r\nUnderclassification of freight was a very common device in the old\r\ndays. It has reappeared again since 1907 in much the same form. There\r\nis a great difference between the freight on a keg of nails and of fine\r\nbrass hardware or cutlery. Who is to know whether a shipment be billed\r\nas one or the other? Is every box of dry goods to be examined in order\r\nto discover whether it contains silks or the cheapest cotton cloth? A\r\ncarload of lumber or cordwood might easily by prearrangement be filled\r\ninside with high grade package freight. The utmost vigilance is in fact\r\nnecessary on the part of carriers, to prevent such fraudulent practices\r\nby shippers. Under the Joint Rate Trunk Line Inspection Bureau in 1893,\r\n183,575 such false descriptions or underweighings were detected on\r\nwestbound shipments from seaboard cities alone.[166] What the amount\r\nof such Underclassification of freight by collusion between agent and\r\nshipper was, can only be conjectured. Even more difficult to detect was\r\nthe practice of under-billing.[167] At a certain time, the rate on\r\nflour from Minneapolis to New York was thirty cents per hundredweight,\r\ndivided between connecting roads in the proportion of ten cents from\r\nMinneapolis to Chicago, and twenty cents from there on to destination.\r\nIn the meantime, as against this ten cent proportion of the through\r\nrate to New York, the local rate from Minneapolis to Chicago was twelve\r\nand one-half cents. As between two rival shippers, the one sending to\r\nChicago on a New York through rate instead of a local one, would enjoy\r\na clear advantage of twenty-five per cent. over his competitor. And\r\nwho was to know whether a car billed through to New York, was really\r\ngoing beyond Chicago or not? In one period of three months, 1098 cars\r\nthus through billed to New York were turned over at Chicago to a belt\r\nline road; and only 468 actually went on to that destination. About\r\nsixty per cent. of the traffic was being rebated by this means. Very\r\ncomplicated arrangements of this sort were rife in the Missouri river\r\nrate wars on grain in 1896. This was known as the \"expense-bill\"\r\nsystem; or \"carrying at the balance of the through rate.\"[168]\r\n\r\nMany services or facilities are worth as much to a merchant as a direct\r\nrefund in cash. He may be given free cartage. This was a very common\r\nexpedient in the early days; being fully considered by the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission.[169] Or free storage on wheels or in freight\r\nhouses may be utilized as a cover for favoritism. A low carload rate\r\nmight be given, and then the goods be held, storage free, by the\r\nrailway at some central point; to be subsequently delivered piecemeal\r\nas sold. The dealer would be relieved of all expense for warehousing\r\nas well as of high less-than-carload rates from the initial point of\r\nshipment. The competitor who paid the less-than-carload rate on an\r\nequal volume of business would be sadly handicapped. Cases are on\r\nrecord where fish was thus stored free from November to February,\r\nbeing reshipped on order in small lots. Or an excessive allowance might\r\nbe made by the railway for some service or facility afforded by the\r\nshipper. The beef interests first got their hold upon the carriers by\r\ndemanding liberal rebates in return for acting as \"eveners\" in the\r\npartition of traffic between the trunk lines about 1873. Complaint\r\nagainst excessive allowances to favored grain elevator owners, was\r\ncommon all through the West for years. The elevator allowance cases\r\nbefore the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1906-1910 concerning\r\npractices on the Union Pacific lines illustrate the delicacy of the\r\nissues involved.[170]\r\n\r\nDeductions from the full tariff for the use of special equipment owned\r\nby shippers, has been one of the commonest means of building up great\r\nmonopolies.[171] The allowances to the Standard Oil Company for the use\r\nof its tank cars, before the construction of pipe lines, and especially\r\nprior to 1888, were a source of great unrest.[172] But the construction\r\nof pipe lines has not lessened their importance. It is on record that\r\nthe use of private cars in other lines of business has led to grave\r\nabuses. When stock cars and beef refrigerator cars, owned by private\r\nshippers, first began to be used about 1883-1884, they were much\r\nsought after by the railroads as traffic. They moved regularly, not by\r\nseasons; the volume of business was large and rapidly growing; it was\r\nconcentrated at a few large initial points; much of it was high class\r\nand very remunerative. With the enormous extension of refrigeration\r\nto cover the long-distance movement of fruit and vegetables, a still\r\nmore powerful encouragement came into play. These latter businesses\r\nwere highly seasonal. Few roads could afford to maintain highly\r\nspecialized equipment to care for a business of a few weeks length.\r\nBut a private company operating all over the country, could utilize\r\nits cars first for early vegetables and fruits from the south, then\r\nfrom the middle west or the Oregon-Washington region, and finally in\r\nwinter for oranges from California or Florida. The number of these cars\r\nrapidly increased until by 1903 there were 130,000 in service,--in fact\r\nabout one-eleventh of all the freight cars in the United States were\r\nprivately owned. The so-called Armour interests, primarily engaged in\r\nthe packing business, were by far the largest single concern.\r\n\r\nThe system of payment for the use of these cars consisted of an\r\nallowance, based upon the mileage performed. This used to be one cent\r\nper mile, loaded and empty, for refrigerator cars. In 1894 a determined\r\neffort was made by the carriers to reduce this below the point then\r\nreached of three-fourths of a cent per mile. But the extraordinary\r\nconcentration both of ownership and traffic, rendered it easy for the\r\ncar companies to defeat the proposition. In the meantime the steady\r\nincrease in volume of traffic, making whole trainloads possible,\r\ntogether with the growth of very long distance business, made it\r\nimperative that these trains be operated at high speed with few stops.\r\nThis at once enormously enhanced the earning power of each car, as\r\nbased upon mileage. The performance was often as high as four times\r\nthat of the ordinary freight cars.\r\n\r\nUnder these new conditions, at the current rate of earnings, a car\r\nwould pay for itself in three years, besides paying all expenses of\r\nmaintenance. The burden of these allowances became very great. The\r\nsituation some years ago is well described by a former member of the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission, as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"Investigations made by the Interstate Commerce Commission at\r\n    different times have disclosed to some extent the very large\r\n    sums received by shippers as mileage for the use of such cars.\r\n\r\n    \"By an investigation made in 1889 it appeared that on a single\r\n    line of road between Chicago and an interior Eastern point--a\r\n    distance of 470 miles--refrigerator cars owned by three\r\n    shipping firms made in nine months, from August 1, 1888, to May\r\n    1889, 7,428,406 miles, and earned for mileage $72,945.97, being\r\n    about $8,112 a month or substantially at the rate of $100,000 a\r\n    year.\r\n\r\n    \"By another investigation, made in 1890, it appeared that\r\n    private stock cars to the number of 250 had been used upon\r\n    a line made up of two connecting roads between Chicago and\r\n    New York, beginning with 150 cars on September 1, 1880,\r\n    increased 30 more a month later, 20 more another month later,\r\n    and reaching the total of 250 in June, 1890; that the cars\r\n    altogether had cost $156,500, and had earned for mileage in\r\n    two years, from September 1, 1888, to September 1, 1890,\r\n    $205,582.68; that the entire expense to be deducted during that\r\n    period for car repairs and salaries for their management was\r\n    $34,050.48, leaving net revenue to the amount of $171,532.20,\r\n    being an excess of $15,032 above the whole cost of the cars.\r\n    The cars were, therefore, paid for and a margin besides in two\r\n    years, and, thereafter, under the same management and with a\r\n    corresponding use of the cars, an income of upward of $100,000\r\n    a year was assured on an investment fully repaid, or, in\r\n    effect, on no investment whatever.\"\r\n\r\nBy 1903 the railroads were paying over $12,000,000 annually for the use\r\nof such equipment.\r\n\r\nWith the growth of their power, the extortionate demands of these\r\nprivate car lines, both upon the railroads and the shipper, steadily\r\nenlarged. From the roads they often compelled fictitious mileage\r\nallowances; and from the shipper the most outrageous charges were made\r\nfor icing and other services en route. The reports of the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission for 1903-1904 and of the Senate (Elkins) Committee\r\nof 1905 deal fully with these abuses. Moreover the Armour company\r\ngradually forced other competitors out of business, and with the growth\r\nof monopoly, its exactions became even more extreme. The following\r\ninstance is typical.\r\n\r\n    \"In 1898 the Armour Car Lines Company was furnishing cars\r\n    for the movement of Michigan fruits from points on the Pere\r\n    Marquette Railroad to Boston in competition with other private\r\n    car companies, and its charge for refrigeration to Boston was\r\n    $20 per car. Its present charge to Boston is $55 per car.\r\n    Before the present exclusive contract was entered into between\r\n    the Armour Car Lines and the Pere Marquette Railroad Company\r\n    the actual quantity of ice required was charged for at $2.50\r\n    per ton. Under this system the cost of refrigerating cars from\r\n    Pawpaw, Mich., to Dubuque, Iowa, averaged about $10 per car,\r\n    while the present schedule of the Armour Car Lines is $37.50.\r\n    The cost of icing from Mattawan, Mich., to Duluth was $7.50,\r\n    as shown by an actual transaction in the year 1902, while the\r\n    present refrigeration charge between those points is $45. The\r\n    cost of icing pineapples from Mobile to Cincinnati under an\r\n    exclusive contract with the Armour Car Lines is $45, while\r\n    the cost of performing the same service from New Orleans to\r\n    Cincinnati over the Illinois Central is $12.50 per car.\"\r\n\r\nFortunately the progressive enlargement of Federal powers of\r\nsupervision has tended to check these exactions. But the system of\r\nspecial allowances for the use of privately owned equipment, is one\r\nwhich needs the most careful watching by the authorities.\r\n\r\nWith the passage of time, and especially since 1896, new and even more\r\nelaborate schemes for rebating have come to light. One of the most\r\ningenious, which was discovered about 1904 to be very widespread,\r\nwas the use of terminal or spur track railway companies.[173] In\r\nHutchinson, Kansas, for example, were salt works having a capacity of\r\nsome 6000 barrels a day. Two railways were available for shipments.\r\nA new company was incorporated, all its stock being held by the salt\r\nworks owners, which constructed sidings to both railroad lines. The\r\nspur track was less than a mile long and cost only about $8000 to\r\nbuild. But the company was chartered as the Hutchinson and Arkansas\r\nRiver Railroad. Its officers were the owners of the salt mills.\r\nIt owned neither engines nor cars. Yet it entered into a traffic\r\nagreement with the Atchison road for a division of the through rate\r\nto many important points, its share being about twenty-five per cent.\r\nSo substantial a pro-rate was this, that in a few months the H. and\r\nA. R. R. received back some fifteen thousand dollars as its share of\r\nthe through freight rates. And every dividend declared by it was, of\r\ncourse in effect a rebate enjoyed exclusively by this particular mill,\r\nas against less favored competitors.\r\n\r\nObviously, rebates assuming the above-described form are open only\r\nto very large shippers, to whom it is worth while to incur the\r\nconsiderable expense. But many concerns have already such trackage in\r\nor about their works. Nothing is needed except to incorporate them\r\nseparately, and then to enter into suitable traffic agreements with\r\nstandard roads. Many of the so-called trusts were implicated in such\r\ntransactions, about 1904-1905. The International Harvester Company\r\nat Chicago had for years performed much of its own terminal service;\r\nand until 1904 was allowed as high as $3.50 per car for switching\r\ncharges by connecting railroads. It then incorporated the Illinois\r\nNorthern Railroad, which was promptly conceded twenty per cent, of\r\nall through rates, with the Missouri river rate as a maximum. On this\r\ntraffic it would be allowed as high as $12 per car, instead of $3.50\r\nas before. The Illinois Steel Company afforded in 1905 an even more\r\nflagrant example. Apparently it had enjoyed extra-liberal proportions\r\nof through rates since 1897, by means of its separately incorporated\r\nand, in fact, really important terminal road. But an allowance of $700\r\nto $1000 for hauling a trainload of coke some seven miles, yielded a\r\nprofit on the business of perhaps ninety per cent. It was an advantage\r\nwhich no competitor could hope to equal. No doubt the practice of\r\nswitching allowances was properly used at the start. But the large crop\r\nof cases discovered in 1904-1905 proved that they had come to be very\r\nwidely used as a cover for rebating. It is not always easy, however,\r\nto decide when such an allowance ought to be made to a privately owned\r\nterminal company. The Anheuser-Busch case, decided in June, 1911, with\r\na dissenting opinion by Commissioner Harlan, shows how intricately\r\ninvolved such issues may become.[174]\r\n\r\nThe so-called \"midnight tariff\" was a strictly legal way of conferring\r\nfavors upon certain shippers. It was much in evidence during the grain\r\nwars between lines serving the Gulf ports about 1903. And it seems\r\nto have been a device used at times all over the country. A traffic\r\nmanager wishing to steal all the business of a large shipper from some\r\ncompeting road, and to build him up at the expense of his rivals,\r\nsecretly agrees to put into effect a low rate on a given date. The\r\nshipper then enters into contracts calling for perhaps several hundred\r\ncarloads of grain to be delivered at that time. This reduction is\r\npublicly filed, perhaps thirty days in advance, with the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission at Washington. But who is to discover it, in the\r\ngreat medley of new tariffs placed on file every day? Yet this is not\r\nall. A second tariff, restoring the full rate, is also filed to take\r\neffect very shortly,--perhaps only a day,--after the reduction occurs.\r\nAll these are public, and open to all shippers alike. But only the one\r\nwho was forewarned is able to take advantage of them. He rushes all\r\nhis shipments forward while the reduced rates are in effect. Before\r\nother competitors can assemble their grain or other goods, the brief\r\nreduction has come to an end; and rates are restored to their former\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\nThe President of the Chicago Great Western Railway has concisely\r\ndescribed the commercial effect of one of these midnight tariffs.\r\n\r\n    \"A clean profit, he says, over all expenses of one half of a\r\n    cent per bushel is a satisfactory profit to the middleman;\r\n    and a guaranteed rate of transportation of even so small a\r\n    sum as one-quarter of a cent per bushel less than any other\r\n    middleman can get, will give the man possessing it a monopoly\r\n    of the business of handling the corn in the district covered by\r\n    the guaranty. Why? Such are the facilities of trade by means\r\n    of bills of lading, drafts, telegraphs, banks, etc., that\r\n    to do an enormous corn trade, the middleman requires only a\r\n    comparatively small capital to use as a margin. A capital of\r\n    $50,000 is ample thus to handle 15,000,000 bushels, and with\r\n    activity, double that amount, per annum. One quarter of a cent\r\n    per bushel profit on 15,000,000 bushels would amount to $37,500\r\n    which is equal to .75 per cent. per annum on the capital\r\n    employed.\"\r\n\r\nA similar device was used by the Burlington road in its dealings with\r\nthe Missouri river packing houses on export traffic. They signed an\r\nagreement making a rate to Germany of twenty-three cents per hundred\r\nto last until December 31, 1905. Before the expiration of this time,\r\nhowever, the roads concerned, publicly filed an amended tariff\r\npresumably for all shippers of thirty-five cents per hundred. They\r\nnevertheless continued the old rate to the packers. This case went to\r\nthe Supreme Court which decided in 1908 that the device was unlawful\r\nand discriminatory.[175]\r\n\r\nAnd then again there are all the possibilities of the printer's art to\r\nbe used, in connection with the preparation of elaborate tariffs.[176]\r\nThe tariff of \"33 cents per hundredweight\" may conceivably be a\r\ntypographical error, to be speedily corrected in a supplementary\r\nhektograph sheet filed the next day. Involved and elaborate rate\r\nsheets may be reprinted with only one little change among a thousand\r\nitems left as before. Different tariffs may interlock with complicated\r\ncross references. In one case in 1902 it took seven different tariffs\r\nto enable one to compute the rate for a given shipment. In twelve\r\nmonths, to December 1907, there were filed with the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission 220,982 such tariffs, each containing changes in rates or\r\nrules. Some \"expire with this shipment,\"--and some agree to \"protect\"\r\nany rate of any competing carrier, that is to say, to meet it if it\r\nhappen to be lower.\r\n\r\nAn entirely different plan of rebating,--and a most effective one,--has\r\nto do with apparently unrelated commercial transactions.[177] Many\r\nshippers are large sellers of supplies to the railroad. How easy then\r\nto make a concession in rates to an oil refinery for example, by\r\npaying a little extra for the lubricating oil bought from a subsidiary\r\nconcern. The Federal authorities in recent years and especially\r\nin connection with the prosecution of the Standard Oil Company in\r\n1908-1911, have discovered the most extraordinary variations in the\r\nprices paid by railroads for supplies. Independent concerns were often\r\nnot allowed to compete in the sale of lubricants at all. It would be\r\ndifficult to prove any connection between so widely separate sets of\r\ndealings; and yet it is clear that rebates are often given in this way.\r\nOr even more fruitful as an expedient, especially in these later days\r\nwhen rebating is a serious offence, why not confer a favor by extra\r\nliberality in allowances for damages to goods in transit? In 1909 the\r\nso-called Beef Trust was specifically ordered by the Attorney General\r\nof the United States to desist from such practices. Positively the only\r\nway to detect such fictitious allowances for damages, is to ferret out\r\neach case by itself. This is a slow and necessarily expensive process.\r\nDamage allowances and _quid pro quo_ transactions in the purchase of\r\nsupplies, are indeed almost \"smokeless rebates,\" as they have aptly\r\nbeen termed.\r\n\r\nPersonal discrimination may be as effective upon competition through\r\ndenial of facilities to some shippers, as through conferring of special\r\nfavors upon others. Practices of this sort have been quite common in\r\nthe coal business, especially in the matter of furnishing or refusing\r\nto furnish an ample supply of cars or suitable spur tracks to mines. In\r\nthe well known Red Rock Fuel Company case in 1905,[178] the railroad\r\ndefinitely announced its policy, \"not to have a lot of little shippers\r\non its line who would ship coal when prices were high and then shut\r\nup shop and go home and let the large shippers have the lean years.\"\r\nThe development of over 4,000 acres of coal lands was thus denied in\r\nfavor of the large companies, until the Interstate Commerce Commission\r\ntook the matter up. A year later came the startling revelations upon\r\nthe Pennsylvania Railroad as to the practice of discrimination in\r\nfurnishing cars to coal mines.[179] A comprehensive investigation by\r\nthe company itself resulted in the discharge of a number of high\r\nofficials. It appeared, for example, that the assistant to President\r\nCassatt had acquired $307,000 in stock of coal companies without cost;\r\nthat a trainmaster for $500 had purchased coal mine stock which yielded\r\nan annual income of $30,000; and that one road foreman was given three\r\nhundred shares of the same company stock for nothing. In all these\r\ncases the object was to secure not only an ample supply of cars for\r\nthe favored companies, but perhaps even the denial of suitable service\r\nto troublesome competitors. In this regard, the old practices of the\r\nStandard Oil Company in the eighties are recalled. Not only, as in\r\nthe celebrated Rice case,[180] did it demand heavy refunds on its own\r\nshipments, but it also compelled the imposition of a surtax on its\r\ncompetitors' traffic which was to be added to its own special allowance.\r\n\r\nYet other means of favoring large shippers at the expense of small\r\nones, are almost impossible to eradicate. Certain of these may be\r\nillustrated by recently discovered practices of the Standard Oil\r\nCompany. They are fully described in a special report of the United\r\nStates Commissioner of Corporations in 1905. Upon the basis of this\r\nevidence, extraordinary efforts were made by the Federal authorities\r\nto secure convictions and to impose heavy fines for violation of the\r\nElkins law. But the company escaped heavy penalties, in the main, by\r\nreason of legal technicalities. The prosecutions of 1906-1909, however,\r\ncannot be regarded as valueless, merely because the company escaped\r\nthe imposition of fines aggregating millions of dollars. The moral\r\neffect of it was thoroughly good; and it is now clear that laws can be\r\nso drawn as to apply in future. Nor can any student of the evidence\r\ndoubt for a moment, that, whether strictly an infraction of the law\r\nor not, the net result of these practices was to confer an advantage\r\nupon this large shipper, not open to its smaller competitors. Certain\r\nof its advantages, such as the ownership of pipe lines from the\r\nwells to the seaboard refineries and the strategic location of its\r\nplants, are the fruit of great resources and keen business acumen. But\r\nother advantages, particularly the relative rates on refined oil from\r\nStandard Oil plants and from centres of independent refining, are,\r\naccording to the report of the Bureau of Corporations, due to pressure\r\nbrought to bear upon the carriers. Whether they are or not, the result\r\nis discriminatory just the same.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the persistent pressure for low rates on petroleum\r\nproducts is, of course, that the cost of manufacture is so low\r\nrelatively to the expense of transportation. An ample manufacturing\r\nprofit is one-half cent per gallon of crude oil; and the average cost\r\nof refining does not exceed that amount. Yet a half cent will scarcely\r\npay freight for more than one hundred miles. Hence it follows that\r\nfor distances greater than this, the question of profit or loss may\r\nentirely depend upon the delicate adjustment of the freight rate. In\r\nthis regard, a great company shipping all over the country has a great\r\nadvantage over smaller competitors with a strictly local market, in\r\nthat it can play off one rate against another. Thus, in one notable\r\ncase, cited by the Bureau of Corporations, the Burlington road gave\r\nan absolutely unremunerative rate from the Standard refinery at\r\nWhiting near Chicago to East St. Louis, thereby enabling troublesome\r\ncompetition to be subdued; but it was recompensed by the payment of\r\nheavier charges on shipments to other points on the Burlington system,\r\nwhere, there being no competition, the high freight rate could be\r\nshifted on to the consumer. The Commissioner of Corporations gives\r\none instance on the Northwestern road of a carload rate from Whiting\r\nto Milwaukee in order to meet water competition from independents at\r\nToledo, which netted the carrier just ninety-two cents for the carriage\r\nof 24,000 pounds of oil a distance of eighty-five miles, with free\r\nreturn of the empty car.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarity of many of these rate adjustments of the Standard Oil\r\nCompany of late years was that they were publicly filed; and hence not\r\nopen to legal attack. This does not however detract in the least from\r\ntheir discriminatory character. One example, right here in New England,\r\nnow happily corrected, may be cited from the records of the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission for 1906.[181] The southern half of New England\r\nwas mainly supplied with kerosene from the great Standard refinery\r\nat Bayonne, New Jersey. The oil was brought there from the fields by\r\npipe line; and, being refined, was distributed by tank vessels all\r\nalong the coast, with a short rail haul thereafter to inland points.\r\nThe total cost to the Standard company was estimated by the Bureau of\r\nCorporations at between fourteen and sixteen cents per hundredweight.\r\nTo meet this, the independent western refiners had to ship all the\r\nway by rail. This was more expensive in any event; but for some years\r\nthey found their handicap greatly increased by the refusal of the New\r\nHaven road to join in any joint through rate. The western independents,\r\ntherefore, had to pay the sum of two local rates, up to and beyond the\r\nHudson river, thereby bringing their transportation up to approximately\r\nthirty cents per hundred pounds. In other words, their cost of carriage\r\nper gallon was enhanced more than enough to constitute a fair refining\r\nprofit in itself. The result was the practical exclusion of competition\r\nfrom this source. Fortunately, however, after this investigation the\r\nNew Haven was ordered to pro-rate with the western roads, thereby\r\novercoming about half of this disability. This case clearly evinces\r\nthe necessity of effective Federal regulation of such matters as joint\r\nrates; and it also shows how possible it may be to so adjust tariffs,\r\nopenly and even legally, as to favor one shipper over another.\r\n\r\nUnlike the preceding instance, most of the Standard's rebates have\r\nbeen, in fact if not technically, secret. Perhaps the most flagrant\r\ncase occurred in the rates from Whiting to the southeastern states. The\r\nBureau of Corporations estimated that $70,000 a year was saved by this\r\ndevice; and all competition from independent sources was eliminated\r\nwithin that territory. The Illinois Central and Southern roads cross at\r\nan obscure point in Tennessee known as Grand Junction. This was made a\r\ncentre of distribution for the entire South.[182] But the rate under\r\nwhich the oil moved,--and in one given month 169 carloads were thus\r\ncarried,--was given on a special tariff, publicly filed at Washington,\r\nto be sure, but prescribing the rate, not from Whiting but from Dalton,\r\nIllinois, to Grand Junction, Tennessee. Dalton was an almost unknown\r\nstation, near the refinery. Of course any other shipper who happened to\r\nknow of it, and who happened to have oil to ship from Dalton to Grand\r\nJunction, could have had the same rate of thirteen cents a hundred\r\npounds. But he would find it moved over a roundabout route, over four\r\ndifferent connecting lines, instead of over the rails of a single\r\ncompany. As against this rate of thirteen cents, the only routes known\r\nto the Ohio independent producers charged from nineteen to twenty-nine\r\nand one-half cents per hundred pounds. Meantime the Standard's oil was\r\nby this devious means reaching every point in the South at prices which\r\nno competitor could hope to meet. In one case, the oil going by way of\r\nGrand Junction, travelled over one thousand miles when the direct route\r\nfrom Chicago was only a little over five hundred miles. The adjustment\r\nwas everywhere such that, even on the commonly known tariffs, Whiting\r\nenjoyed a special advantage over the sources of independent oil.\r\nAtlanta, Georgia, is only 733 miles by short line and 1003 miles by\r\nway of Grand Junction from Whiting. Toledo, with its independent\r\nrefineries, is distant only 687 miles. Yet despite this fact, the\r\ncommonly known rates were shown to be, from Whiting, 33.2 cents as\r\nagainst 47.5 cents from Toledo. So, even without the Grand Junction\r\ncontrivance, the Standard was seemingly favored more than enough. It\r\nshould be added, in conclusion, that while the Grand Junction rate was\r\npublicly filed, its discriminatory character stands proven by the fact\r\nthat all the actual shipments were \"blind billed;\" that is to say, no\r\nlocal agent knew what was the rate actually paid. Such blind bills\r\nof lading are photographically reproduced in the report above named.\r\nMoreover the ill repute of the transaction was indicated by the prompt\r\ncancellation of the rate when discovered in 1905. But in the meantime\r\nit had done its work, and fixed monopoly prices for an indispensable\r\nproduct over a quarter of the territory of the United States.\r\n\r\nAside from the palpably dishonest secret rebating, the real root of\r\nthe difficulty with many of the other big shippers beside the Standard\r\nOil Company,--and an abuse moreover exceedingly hard to correct,--is\r\nthe open adjustment of rates from competing centres of manufacture\r\nor distribution in such a way as to confer favors. The Bureau of\r\nCorporation's report on the Transportation of Petroleum Products deals\r\nfully with this. Relative rates, as above stated, always seem to favor\r\nChicago (Whiting) as against the centres of independent refining such\r\nas Cleveland, Pittsburg, or Toledo. Formerly, before the great refinery\r\nwas established in 1890 at Whiting,--which, by the way, produces\r\none-third of all the kerosene used in the United States,--the roads\r\nfrom these centres made joint through rates all over the country. They\r\nstill do so on many other commodities. But on petroleum products they\r\nhave been withdrawn. The result is that everywhere, except where they\r\ncan secure entrance by water, the disability in rates against the\r\nindependent refiner is most effective. That much the same conditions\r\nprevail in other lines of business is affirmed on the highest\r\nauthority. The _Railway Age Gazette_ has repeatedly protested against\r\nthe pressure which is now brought to bear against the carriers by such\r\norganizations as the Illinois Manufacturers' Association to substitute\r\nopen but discriminatory local rates for the old secret favors upon\r\nwhich the great shippers throve for so many years. Fortunately,\r\nhowever, this situation in some cases relieves the Federal government\r\nof the burden of detection of maladjustments of this sort. For the\r\ncommunities aggrieved are constantly on the watch to protect their\r\ninterests against rival cities. This factor clearly appears in the\r\nsugar and cement lighterage cases in 1908.[183] Carriers at New York in\r\norder to equalize rates with carriers serving Philadelphia refineries,\r\ngrant \"accessorial allowances\" for the use of lighters or for cartage,\r\nin order, as they aver, to overcome the disability against their\r\nclients. But Philadelphia shippers are ever on the alert to detect\r\nsuch favors given at New York; and substantially aid the government in\r\neradicating the evil. In the grain elevator allowance cases, likewise,\r\nat Omaha and Council Bluffs in 1906-1909, not only unfavored shippers\r\nat these points but St. Louis grain merchants as a body, intervened as\r\ncomplainants against the system. The powerful motive of self-interest\r\nthus invoked is of great service.\r\n\r\nBefore dismissing these recent and widely \"muck-raked\" oil cases,\r\nit may not be out of place to mention the new interpretation of the\r\nElkins law which has resulted therefrom. One concerns the definition of\r\nseparate offences. In the notorious $29,000,000 fine case, the Federal\r\nCircuit judge applied the maximum penalty of $20,000 for each offence\r\nto each separate carload in a large aggregate of shipments. On review\r\nof the case, each separate settlement of freight rates was defined as\r\nthe unit of an offence. As entire train loads had been forwarded or\r\npaid for at one time, this materially reduced the aggregate of possible\r\npenalties. And, in the second place, the question of legally provable\r\nintent was raised. The turning point in the $29,000,000 fine case, was\r\nthe ruling of the judge on review, that it was necessary to prove that\r\na standard rate, higher than the one actually paid, had actually been\r\nfiled at Washington; and that the defendant had knowingly accepted a\r\nconcession from this figure. These points the government was unable in\r\nfact to establish; and this ended the case.[184]\r\n\r\nWhile general rate cutting has been less common since 1900, partly also\r\nbecause the roads were rapidly forming great combinations especially\r\nin order to eliminate it, subsequent developments have proved that\r\npersonal and secret favoritism to large shippers was still very common.\r\nDespite all they could do to withstand pressure, traffic managers\r\nseemed powerless without the aid of the law. Perhaps the greatest\r\nrevelation of the extent of personal rebating was afforded by the great\r\nWisconsin investigation under the leadership of Governor La Follette in\r\n1903.[185] The original purpose of this inquiry was fiscal; namely, to\r\nexamine into the subject of railroad taxation. But its scope speedily\r\nwidened, and at last skilled accountants were put into the books of all\r\nthe railroads traversing Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nThe facts elicited by the Wisconsin investigation were startling. For\r\nthe years 1897-1903, the direct rebates appearing in the accounts of\r\nthe Wisconsin lines alone,--taking no account of other forms of rebates\r\nsuch as excessive damage allowances and the like,--were $7,000,000.\r\nThe Chicago and Northwestern alone had allowed more than half of this\r\namount. And from what is now known of other forms of allowance, the\r\ntotal must have been indeed very great. In one year recently, there\r\nwas evidence to the effect that rebates on the New York Central lines\r\namounted to $1,000,000. According to its own admission, the Michigan\r\nCentral road, in 1902-1903, made allowances of $586,000. The rebating\r\nto the beef packers, especially on export business during 1902, was\r\nnotorious. No wonder the progressive railroad leaders desired to put\r\nan end to this leakage of revenue. And at their request, the wise\r\nlegislation known as the Elkins Amendments to the Act to Regulate\r\nCommerce was passed in 1903.[186]\r\n\r\nThe Elkins law of 1903 not only came at a time when the carriers were\r\nin need of every cent of revenue to tide over a hard year, but it also\r\nfollowed demonstration under the test of judicial procedure, that\r\nconvictions for rebating were practically impossible under the old\r\nlaw. To convict for unjust discrimination it was necessary to show,\r\nnot merely the allowance to one favored shipper, but the fact also had\r\nto be proved that no such allowances were made to others on the same\r\nsort of traffic under similar conditions. This could scarcely ever be\r\ndone. In fact, during almost twenty years, there had been less than\r\na score of convictions. Most of the prosecutions had failed utterly.\r\nBoth government and carriers pressed for legislation. This was promptly\r\ngiven in the Act of February 19, 1903. There were four important\r\nfeatures of this law. Railway corporations, not merely individuals as\r\nbefore, were now made directly liable to prosecution and penalties. The\r\ntariff filed became the lawful standard. The fact that all shippers got\r\nthe same low rate was, therefore, no longer a defence. In the third\r\nplace, the shipper as well as the carrier could be held accountable. In\r\nother words, accepting as well as giving rebates, became unlawful. And,\r\nfinally, jurisdiction was conferred upon the Federal courts to restrain\r\nany departure from published rates or any \"discrimination forbidden\r\nby law\" by writ of injunction. This fully legalized a rather doubtful\r\ncourse of procedure to which the Interstate Commerce Commission had\r\nbeen compelled to resort as a last weapon in the rate wars on grain and\r\nbeef since 1901. It also abolished the penalty of adjustment; imposing\r\nfines instead. But this action was subsequently rescinded in the law\r\nof 1906.\r\n\r\nThe record of the vigorous prosecutions against rebating under the\r\nElkins law,[187] affords conclusive evidence, not only as to the\r\nwidespread extent of the evil, but as to its identification with many\r\nof the large industrial combinations. The history of the activities\r\nof the Interstate Commerce Commission is to be found in its file of\r\nannual reports. But little seems to have been done for the first two\r\nyears; but great activity was displayed during 1905. The ensuing year\r\nwas rather notable by reason of the success in securing convictions.\r\nBesides the Standard Oil cases, there was collected in fines for\r\nrebating between October, 1905, and March, 1907, the sum of $586,000.\r\nSeveral men were sent to jail, for from three to six months. Among the\r\ntrusts implicated were the beef packers, who have been indefatigable\r\nin concocting rebating devices; the tin plate combination; and, most\r\nnotable of all, the American Sugar Refining Company. Nearly $300,000\r\nin fines was imposed upon this concern alone. The secret allowances\r\nin these cases were most ingeniously arranged. Some were \"refund\r\nof terminal charges;\" some were \"lighterage demurrage;\" some were\r\nallowances for damages. Many were paid by drafts instead of checks so\r\nas to preclude identification of individuals; some were by special\r\nbank account; but the sums involved were very large. Shipments of\r\nsugar on which rebates of four to six cents per hundred were given,\r\namounted within a relatively brief period to upwards of 70,000,000\r\npounds on one line alone. As sugar shipments westbound from New York\r\nconstituted nearly one-third of the total tonnage, the importance of\r\nthese prosecutions appear. The following quotation from a letter from\r\nan agent of the sugar trust accompanying a claim for overcharge of\r\n$6,866 on shipments of syrup, introduced in evidence in one of these\r\ncases, aptly describes the situation, both then, now, and always. \"We\r\nhope to devise some means to enable us to conduct our freight matters\r\nwith the transportation companies satisfactorily even under the new\r\nconditions imposed by the Elkins bill; but there may be some cases that\r\ncannot be taken care of, in the event of which we will, like all other\r\nshippers, have to take our medicine and look pleasant.\" The Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission reported as to the conditions in 1908 that \"many\r\nshippers still enjoy illegal advantages.\" Many convictions were,\r\nhowever, secured. And investigations in California showed the existence\r\nof an extensive system of preferential rates.[188] A list of 108 firms\r\nwas discovered on the Southern Pacific road alone, who were enjoying\r\n\"special inside rates\" which often aggregated $50,000 per month. Many\r\nof these assumed the form of refunds upon claims for damages.\r\n\r\nThus the rebate as an evil in transportation, even since amendment\r\nof the law in 1906-1910, while under control, is still far from\r\nbeing eradicated. Favoritism lurks in every covert, assuming almost\r\nevery hue and form. Practices which outwardly appear to be necessary\r\nand legitimate, have been shown to conceal special favors of a\r\nsubstantial sort. Among the latest forms, undue extension of credit\r\nmay be mentioned. It appeared, for instance, in 1910 that the Hocking\r\nValley Railroad was favoring the Sunday Creek Coal Company to the\r\nextent of credit for transportation on its books to the amount of\r\n$2,400,000.[189] Another device which amounted to favoritism whether\r\nso intended or not, has been brought into court upon prosecution of\r\nthe so-called Beef Trust. Substantial concessions in the rate from\r\nKansas City to various foreign countries prevailed by reason of the\r\nfact that long time contracts for shipments at an established rate\r\ncontinued after a new higher general tariff had been put into effect.\r\nThis increase of rates in general, leaving the trust rates at the old\r\nfigure, of course created an undue and unlawful preference.[190] The\r\nchapter might be further amplified by details concerning \"substitution\r\nof tonnage at transit points;\"[191] excessive allowance for claims,\r\nand, as in a recent important case against the New York Central,\r\nexorbitant rates paid for advertising in a theatrical publication, in\r\norder to secure transportation for an itinerant troupe of travelling\r\nplayers.[192]\r\n\r\nThe extreme subtlety of personal favoritism was recently brought to\r\nlight in connection with the selling price of coal in the little\r\ntown of Durham, North Carolina.[193] Complaint was entered that\r\na certain retailer was charging but five dollars a ton while his\r\ncompetitors were unable to dispose of theirs at a profit for less\r\nthan six dollars. The explanation offered, that this person employing\r\nno bookkeeper and, paying no rent, was enabled to do this because of\r\nthese savings, proved inadequate. Investigation developed the fact\r\nthat no direct preference from railroads existed, but that there were,\r\nnevertheless, various peculiar features as to division of rates which\r\ninvited further examination. Thus, for example, while the Norfolk\r\n& Western received $30.80 for hauling a carload of coal 160 miles,\r\nthe Durham & South Carolina Railroad received $24.80 for hauling the\r\nsame car one mile. This little railroad was owned by a lumber company\r\nwhich seemed in effect to have set up the defendant coal merchant in\r\nbusiness. An arrangement between this little switching road and the\r\nSeaboard Air Line, as well as the Norfolk & Western, also favored the\r\nDurham & Southern. The key to the situation lay in the fact that the\r\nDukes,--powerful financial interests controlling the American Tobacco\r\nCompany, the Southern Power Company and large cotton mills,--also\r\ncontrolled the Durham & Southern through the lumber company. The\r\nSeaboard Air Line, therefore, when it gave to this little switching\r\nroad for a twenty-mile haul, about forty per cent. of its division on\r\nthrough business, surreptitiously conferred a heavy bonus upon its\r\nlittle connection. It must have lost money under such a division of\r\nrates. The only conclusion possible is that this little railroad was\r\nspecially favored in order to purchase the goodwill of financiers\r\ncontrolling a large traffic in other lines of business. The rebate,\r\nhowever, was not given to the American Tobacco Company, but constituted\r\na comfortable profit \"on the side\" for powerful interests in its\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\nThe elevation cases concerning the legitimacy of a special payment\r\nfor unloading grain in private elevators, have been under dispute for\r\nyears. Their validity has recently been affirmed by the Supreme Court\r\nin an important decision in 1911.[194] This litigation illustrates\r\nthe difficulty of defining rebates as an expression of personal\r\nfavoritism. In 1899, the Union Pacific Railroad made a contract\r\nwith Peavey & Company at Council Bluffs to erect an elevator and to\r\ntransfer grain for a charge of one and one-quarter cents a hundred\r\npounds. This arrangement was objected to by competing railroads on\r\nthe ground that it gave compensation to a private concern, engaged\r\nin general grain business for the handling of its own property. The\r\nUnion Pacific insisted that the expedient was necessary and proper\r\nas a means for promptly unloading its cars at Omaha. The Commission,\r\nafter investigation, sanctioned the contract. In 1907, the matter again\r\ncame before the Commission upon complaint of other railroads competing\r\nwith the Union Pacific along the Missouri river. It was alleged that\r\nthe continuance of the elevator allowance by the Union Pacific would\r\nvirtually compel all other roads to make similar allowances. Still the\r\nCommission adhered to its former conclusion that undue discrimination\r\ndid not result. The practice, however, gradually spread until all the\r\nroads at Missouri river points put in an allowance of three-fourths of\r\none cent as an elevator charge. This brought forth a complaint from the\r\nlines at St. Louis that traffic was being diverted from that point as\r\na result; and the Commission, once more considering the matter, held\r\nthat the practice was prejudicial to public interest. Conditions, in\r\nfact, had changed, mainly through the increase of through shipments\r\nto the East without transfer at the Missouri river. The Commission,\r\ntherefore, held that when such transfer took place, it was for the\r\naccommodation of local grain merchants, who ought to pay for the\r\nservice rendered. At this stage of the proceedings, the matter went\r\nto the Supreme Court of the United States upon appeal. The decision\r\nfinally upheld the Commission, in holding that the payment of an\r\nelevation allowance was not unlawful, but that if paid to one elevator,\r\nit must be paid to all. The bearing of this case upon the larger issue,\r\nof payments by railroads for special services rendered by, shippers\r\ncannot fail to be of great importance in the future.\r\n\r\nThe use of the industrial railroad as a means of preferential treatment\r\nstill occasions difficulty.[195] The case is simple where but one\r\nshipper makes use of the terminal plant; but where a number of shippers\r\nmay utilize it jointly, it becomes difficult to draw the line between\r\npro-rating allowances and actual rebates. The Manufacturers' Railroad\r\nCompany, with twenty miles of track, four locomotives and one hundred\r\nand ten employees, serves a considerable manufacturing section in\r\nSouth St. Louis. A majority of the stock of this terminal railroad is\r\nheld by persons controlling the Anheuser-Busch Brewery. The enormous\r\ntraffic of this concern, equal to about one-thirtieth of the total\r\ntonnage of St. Louis, is handled over the line of the Manufacturers'\r\nRailway. Almost nine-tenths of its business consists of shipments of\r\nbeer; but in 1910 some 5,424 carloads belonging to other patrons moved\r\nover its rails. For this terminal service the Anheuser-Busch Company,\r\nthrough the Manufacturers' Railway, got a very substantial allowance\r\nfor the service rendered. For example, in one month on ten carloads of\r\nbeer, the Louisville & Nashville allowed $45 out of a total revenue\r\nof $391.60 for moving the traffic something less than four thousand\r\nfeet. The disparity is obvious between this allowance and the balance\r\nremaining as compensation for moving the traffic 477 miles, including\r\nthree first-class railroad tolls and terminal charges at the other\r\nend.[196]\r\n\r\nA prime difficulty is to determine whether unduly low commodity rates\r\namount practically to special favors granted to large shippers. Much\r\nevidence recently tends to show that the trusts enjoy advantages of\r\nthis sort not extended to other competitors. The Steel Corporation,\r\nthrough its ownership of railroads and steamships, certainly has a\r\ngreat advantage over its rivals.[197] But other trusts not controlling\r\ncommon carriers of their own, are also accorded what seem to be unduly\r\nlow rates upon their products. Recent evidence before the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission seems to show that sugar, beef, and coffee do\r\nnot bear their proper share of transportation costs.[198] Copper,\r\nthe product of a powerful trust, enjoys a lower ton mile rate than\r\ngrain,--a rate, despite its high intrinsic value, actually below that\r\non soft coal.[199] The discrimination is too palpable to be passed over\r\nwithout explanation.\r\n\r\nFrom the survey of rebating and rate wars,--which latter of course\r\nafford the most favored soil in which personal favoritism may\r\nflourish,--one cannot avoid the conclusion that a great improvement in\r\nconditions has been brought about. The strengthened arm of the Federal\r\ngovernment has come to the support of the carriers; and has assisted\r\nthem to a material enhancement of their revenues, by putting a stop to\r\nserious leakages in income. But the carriers could undoubtedly do much\r\non their own account, could they be granted the right to make traffic\r\nagreements, subject always, of course, to the approval and supervision\r\nof the Interstate Commerce Commission. Whether Congress will ever\r\npermit this, remains to be seen. The most important result of all\r\nthis Federal activity so far, has been the moral stimulus toward fair\r\nbusiness dealing which has been given. Thousands of shippers today,\r\nquite apart from the fear of fines or imprisonment, would disdain to\r\nask or accept favors which a decade since would have been regarded\r\nas entirely proper. No one can doubt that the morale of business is\r\ndistinctly higher than it used to be. Could such higher standards\r\nbecome universal, the Department of Justice would be relieved of a\r\nsubstantial part of its present duties.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[162] 14 I. C. C. Rep., 250.

It constitutes\r\none of the most difficult and perplexing problems in transportation.\r\nPersonal discrimination now happily having been practically eliminated\r\nsince the enactment of the Elkins Amendments to the Act to Regulate\r\nCommerce, this issue of local discrimination under the rehabilitated\r\nlong and short haul clause, has recently assumed an added significance.\r\n\r\nA merchant of Wilkesbarre, Pennsylvania, purchased a carload of\r\npotatoes at Rochester, New York, and had the freight bill made for a\r\ndelivery to Philadelphia, because the freight to Philadelphia was less\r\nthan it was to Wilkesbarre, which is 143 miles nearer. He stopped the\r\npotatoes at Wilkesbarre, unloaded them, and paid the freight. A few\r\ndays later he received a bill from the Lehigh Valley Company for twelve\r\ndollars additional freight. If the potatoes had gone to Philadelphia,\r\nhe would have paid forty-eight dollars freightage. As they stopped at\r\nWilkesbarre, he had to pay sixty dollars; that is, twelve dollars for\r\nnot hauling the carload 143 miles.[200]\r\n\r\nA merchant in Montgomery, Alabama, shipped two carloads of fruit jars\r\nfrom Crawfordsville, Indiana, to Montgomery. He shipped them to Mobile\r\nand then paid the local rate from Mobile back, those fruit jars going\r\nthrough Montgomery on the way out. By having them hauled 350 miles\r\nfarther, he saved seventy-five dollars on the two carloads.\r\n\r\nOn first-class goods, at one time, the rate from Louisville to\r\nMontgomery, was $1.26 per hundredweight. On to Mobile, 180 miles\r\nfurther south, it was only ninety cents. In the same territory the rate\r\non kerosene oil from Cincinnati at times has been three times as much\r\nto interior points as to New Orleans, three times as far. West of the\r\nMissouri river and in the Rocky mountain area similar complaints are\r\ncommon. Denver, Colorado, pays $1.79 per hundredweight on cotton piece\r\ngoods, in small lots, hauled 2,000 miles from Boston; while the rate\r\nto San Francisco, 1,400 miles further away, on the same line, is only\r\n$1.50. This discrepancy is even greater in wholesale rates. No carload\r\nrating is given to Denver; while for similar shipments to the coast the\r\nrate is only one dollar per hundredweight. In the opposite direction,\r\nsugar is carried from San Francisco through Denver to Kansas City for\r\nsixty-five cents per hundredweight, as compared with a rate of one\r\ndollar if the sugar is stopped at Denver. Smaller places in the West\r\nafford equally striking instances. The rate on rope from San Francisco\r\nto Independence, Kansas, is seventy-five cents; while the same goods\r\nare hauled on through Independence, Kansas, much farther, to Missouri\r\nriver points for sixty cents per hundred pounds. Wichita, Kansas,\r\ncomplains that cotton piece goods from New York by way of Galveston\r\nare rated at $1.36; while by the same route Kansas City, 225 miles\r\nlonger haul by that route, the charge is only ninety-three cents. The\r\nSouthwestern Lumberman's Association complains,--\r\n\r\n    \"that a train of cars of lumber starts from Camden or other\r\n    common point in Texas via Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe\r\n    Railway, and one car is dropped off in Oklahoma at 27-1/2 cents\r\n    per 100 pounds; one each also at Wichita and Emporia, Kansas,\r\n    at 27-1/2 cents per 100 pounds; one at Kansas City at 23 cents,\r\n    and two cars also set off this same train at Kansas City,\r\n    destined for Omaha and Lincoln, Nebraska, at 23 and 24 cents\r\n    per 100 pounds, respectively. The balance of this train, now at\r\n    Kansas City, runs on to Chicago, and 24 cents per 100 pounds is\r\n    the charge then for most of the train which is left there....\r\n    Why should builders of homes in Wichita and Emporia, Kansas,\r\n    pay higher freight than builders in Kansas City, Omaha, and\r\n    Chicago when using yellow pine from Texas?\"[201]\r\n\r\nSuch instances as these might be multiplied indefinitely. They are\r\noften striking in character. The first impression is of intolerable\r\nabuse. The simplest tenets of justice and fair dealing appear to be\r\nviolated. Careful analysis should, however, always be made before\r\ndrawing such conclusions. Railroad practice seldom departs so\r\nflagrantly from the fundamental consideration of cost of service\r\nwithout very substantial economic justification.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning underlying local discrimination is admirably set forth\r\nby President Hadley in the following passage from his _Railroad\r\nTransportation_:--[202]\r\n\r\n    \"On the coast of Delaware, a few years ago, there was a place\r\n    which we shall call X, well suited for oyster-growing, but\r\n    which sent very few oysters to market, because the railroad\r\n    rates were so high as to leave no margin of profit. The local\r\n    oyster-growers represented to the railroad that if the rates\r\n    were brought down to one dollar per hundred pounds, the\r\n    business would become profitable and the railroad could be sure\r\n    of regular shipments at that price. The railroad men looked\r\n    into the matter. They found that the price of oysters in the\r\n    Philadelphia market was such that the local oystermen could\r\n    pay one dollar per hundred pounds to the railroad and still\r\n    have a fair profit left. If the road tried to charge more, it\r\n    would so cut down the profit as to leave men no inducement to\r\n    enter the business. That is, those oysters would bear a rate\r\n    of one dollar per hundred, and no more. Further, the railroad\r\n    men found that if they could get every day a carload, or nearly\r\n    a carload, at this rate, it would more than cover the expense\r\n    of hauling an extra car by quick train back and forth every\r\n    day, with the incidental expenses of interest and repairs. So\r\n    they put the car on, and were disappointed to find that the\r\n    local oyster-growers could only furnish oysters enough to fill\r\n    the car about half full. The expense to the road of running\r\n    it half full was almost as great as of running it full; the\r\n    income was reduced one-half. They could not make up by raising\r\n    the rates, for these were as high as the traffic would bear.\r\n    They could not increase their business much by lowering rates.\r\n    The difficulty was not with the price charged, but with the\r\n    capacity of the local business. It seemed as if this special\r\n    service must be abandoned.\r\n\r\n    \"One possibility suggested itself. At some distance beyond\r\n    X, the terminus of this railroad, was another oyster-growing\r\n    place, Y, which sent its oysters to market by another route.\r\n    The supply at Y was very much greater than at X. The people\r\n    at Y were paying a dollar a hundred to send their oysters to\r\n    market. It would hardly cost twenty cents to send them from Y\r\n    to X. If, then, the railroad from X to Philadelphia charged\r\n    but seventy-five cents a hundred on oysters which came from\r\n    Y, it could easily fill its car full. This was what they did.\r\n    They then had half a carload of oysters grown at X, on which\r\n    they charged a dollar, and half a carload from Y on which they\r\n    charged seventy-five cents for exactly the same service.\r\n\r\n    \"Of course there was a grand outcry at X. Their trade was\r\n    discriminated against in the worst possible way--so they\r\n    said--and they complained to the railroad. But the railroad men\r\n    fell back on the logic of facts. The points were as follows: 1.\r\n    A whole carload at seventy-five cents would not pay expenses of\r\n    handling and moving. 2. At higher rates than seventy-five cents\r\n    they could not get a whole carload, but only half a carload;\r\n    and half a carload at a dollar rate (the highest charge the\r\n    article would bear) would not pay expenses. Therefore, 3. On\r\n    any uniform rate for everybody, the road must lose money,\r\n    and 4. They would either be compelled to take the oyster car\r\n    away altogether, or else get what they could at a dollar, and\r\n    fill up at seventy-five cents. There was no escape from this\r\n    reasoning; and the oyster men of X chose to pay the higher rate\r\n    rather than lose the service altogether.\"\r\n\r\nThe logic of this oyster case seems convincing in its simplicity. But\r\nit presents more complications than appear at the outset.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFirst of all, what is the nature of the competition at the more distant\r\npoint which is alleged to \"compel\" the lower rate? Is it merely of\r\nrival routes or of competing markets? It will be advisable to keep the\r\ntwo distinct so far as possible. Under the first heading, competition\r\nof routes, the subjoined sketches represent two possible situations. In\r\nboth instances, however, Y, enjoying the lower rate, is more distant\r\nfrom Philadelphia than X. The difference between the two arises from\r\nthe fact that in the one case X is nearer Philadelphia than Y on a\r\nroundabout line; while in the other X is actually nearer than Y by\r\nthe shortest direct route. We may safely assume that the compelling\r\ncompetition alleged at Y as justifying the lower rate is by rail; as,\r\nthe commodity being a marine bivalve, both places presumably enjoy\r\nequal facilities for water carriage. At all events, assuming that we\r\nhave to do with competing rail routes alone, what differences obtain\r\nbetween the two sets of circumstances above sketched? Not insignificant\r\ninequalities in the length or power of the two routes are implied by\r\nthe diagrams. They are supposed to represent substantially different\r\nlines, which may, for the purpose of the argument, be denominated\r\nstrong, natural, or standard, and weak, unnatural, or abnormal,\r\nrespectively, so far as the particular traffic in hand is concerned.\r\nThat this distinction is not irrelevant, but frequently of determinant\r\nforce, is shown by an analysis of concrete cases which have arisen for\r\nadjudication.\r\n\r\nThis proposition is clear beyond dispute. The actual cost of service,\r\nwhich fixes an irreducible minimum rate between Y and Philadelphia, is\r\nless on the short line than by the roundabout one. For either road to\r\naccept less than the portion of the cost traceable to this particular\r\ntraffic, that is to say, the extra cost incident to its acceptance,\r\nis economically inconceivable. From this it follows, other conditions\r\nbeing equal, that the shortest line between Y and Philadelphia\r\nrules the rate in the last instance. This is normally the case. The\r\nroundabout route thereafter merely accepts the rate thus compelled.\r\nTo permit the roundabout line to rule the minimum rate would not only\r\nviolate a fundamental principle of operation: it would inevitably\r\nlead to chaos. The analogy with cut-throat competition in business is\r\nobvious. It is equally plain that the mere acceptance of a short line\r\nrate by a roundabout road, so long as this rate is adequate to yield\r\nsome profit over the extra cost, while of advantage to some, may not\r\nwork positive injury to any one. This condition normally corresponds\r\nto the state of affairs represented by diagram A. The nearer point, X,\r\nas Hadley avers, has no just grievance against Y because the latter\r\nhas the good fortune to have a direct service to Philadelphia at a\r\nlow rate. For Y to withdraw shipments from the line via X might even\r\ndestroy the only chance of X for a market. It would also deprive Y\r\nof whatever benefit it might have derived from competition either of\r\nroutes or of facilities. Of course, we have expressly omitted market\r\ncompetition as a factor, reserving it for separate treatment. Yet\r\none objection arises. Normally, the direct line ought to maintain\r\na tariff conforming in some degree to the distance principle. The\r\nroundabout line can compete at Y only by a violation of it, unless,\r\nindeed, its local tariffs be graded much more gradually. In other\r\nwords, its progression towards the maximum must be distributed over\r\na much longer line. Even this would, on Hadley's statement of fact,\r\neliminate X from the Philadelphia market. Such reduction of local\r\nrates upon the roundabout route would in turn discriminate against\r\nplaces like Z on the direct line, equally distant with X from\r\nPhiladelphia. For the latter places would necessarily be assessed at\r\na higher rate per ton-mile.[203] This would constitute another form\r\nof local discrimination, which will be discussed in due time. There\r\nis, therefore, at best, only a choice of adjustments, either of which\r\nleads to some form of inequality. But, upon the whole, balancing the\r\nevil with the good, the first variant of our oyster case appears to be\r\nbest solved by according all shippers at Y a somewhat lower rate than X\r\nenjoys.\r\n\r\nConditions corresponding to diagram A have frequently given rise to\r\ncomplaints before courts and administrative tribunals. An interesting\r\nillustration is afforded by the Hillsdale ice case in Michigan.[204]\r\nIce was moved from this town to Springfield and Columbus, two\r\nneighboring Ohio cities, over several different routes. (See map on\r\nnext page.) To Columbus the shortest road was by the Hocking Valley\r\nRailroad directly through Toledo. Another route by way of Sandusky\r\nexisted; and even a third through Sandusky, thence over to Springfield,\r\nand in by the side door, so to speak, to Columbus. This last routing\r\nwas due to the fact that the Big Four road from Sandusky diagonally\r\nacross to Springfield had no access to Columbus except through a branch\r\nline from Springfield. This last-named zigzag route was 295 miles in\r\nlength as against 190 miles by the direct line through Toledo. To\r\nSpringfield, on the other hand, no direct route from Hillsdale existed;\r\nbut freight might move either _via_ Sandusky by the Big Four road or\r\nthrough Sandusky and around by way of Columbus. The shortest of any of\r\nthese lines to Springfield, however, was twenty-nine miles longer than\r\nthe shortest line to Columbus. This established Columbus, therefore,\r\nas normally the nearer point. Complaint arose from the fact that ice\r\ncarried over the zigzag route to Columbus actually passed through\r\nSpringfield and forty-five miles beyond to reach its destination. For\r\nsuch shipments over the Big Four road, Springfield instead of Columbus\r\nwas the nearer point. But, contrariwise, for ice coming to Springfield\r\nthrough Columbus, the latter in turn became the intermediate\r\npoint.[205] The specific complaint was that the rate by all routes\r\nto Springfield was one dollar per ton, while to Columbus it was only\r\neighty cents. Originally, the rate was higher ($1.25 per ton), but was\r\nthe same to both points. Is this a case of local discrimination or not?\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Big Four road operating through Springfield answered that it was\r\nnot responsible for the eighty cent rate to Columbus; that this was\r\nmade by the direct line; and that it obviously must meet this rate or\r\nwithdraw from the ice business. It alleged, moreover, that the rate of\r\none dollar was reasonable in itself as compared with other rates in the\r\nsame territory, and was in fact substantially less than it formerly\r\nwas; nor would its withdrawal from Columbus ice business evidently be\r\nof any advantage whatever to Springfield, but would indeed deprive it\r\nof some small contribution to joint expenses of operation on all its\r\ntonnage. No evidence being offered that Springfield was positively\r\ninjured by this adjustment, the Commission properly dismissed the\r\ncomplaint.\r\n\r\nThe distinctive feature of this class of cases, as has been said, is\r\nthat the intermediate point preferring the complaint is always on a\r\nroundabout route.[206] St. Cloud, Minnesota, and Wichita, Kansas, whose\r\ncontentions are described hereafter in detail, were thus situated. The\r\nso-called \"rare and peculiar\" case of Youngstown, Ohio, cited in the\r\noriginal Louisville and Nashville decision of 1889, was in no sense\r\ndifferent. It was a case of pure competition of routes.[207] Traffic\r\nto New York was starting its journey from Pittsburg, over the rails of\r\nthe same company, in exactly opposite directions. Some of it went east\r\nby the direct line; while other freight first moved due west, thence\r\nnorth, by way of Youngstown, Ohio, until it reached the main line at\r\nErie, which took it on to New York. This traffic, therefore, described\r\nthree sides of a rectangle in reaching its destination, traversing a\r\nroute 172 miles longer than by the direct line. The issue was raised\r\nby a demand for as low a rate to New York from Youngstown as Pittsburg\r\nenjoyed, on the ground that it was nearer New York by this indirect\r\nline; Pittsburg traffic, in other words, passing through it _en route_\r\nto the seaboard. The reply, of course, was that, although nearer by an\r\nindirect road, it was more distant by the natural and shortest route,\r\nand consequently should pay more for the service. What the roundabout\r\nline was really demanding was permission to compete at Pittsburg for\r\nNew York business, without being compelled to reduce its local rates\r\nfrom intermediate points like Youngstown. In other words, the long line\r\nwas demanding exemption from the long and short haul clause, while the\r\ndirect short line conformed to it. Without such exemption it could not\r\ncontinue to reach out for Pittsburg business, as the loss incident\r\nto reduction of its local rates would outweigh the profit in the\r\ncompetitive tonnage.\r\n\r\nOne side of the Savannah Freight Bureau Fertilizer case[208]--namely,\r\nthe complaints of local stations on a roundabout road--brings it\r\nwithin our first category. The roundabout line from Charleston to\r\nValdosta, shown upon the map at p. 648, was 413 miles long as against\r\na direct route of only 273 miles. Kathleen, Georgia, is only 288\r\nmiles out from Charleston on this indirect line,--approximately the\r\nsame distance as Valdosta, which thus corresponds to Y in the oyster\r\ncase. Yet Kathleen paid a rate of $3.32 per ton on fertilizer from\r\nCharleston as against $2.48 charged to Valdosta, 125 miles beyond.\r\nBut this excess distance is by an indirect route. Most of the notable\r\nEnglish cases concerning local discrimination appear to be of the same\r\nstamp.[209] The complaints of a number of smaller places in the St.\r\nPaul-Milwaukee territory, like Cannon Falls, Lacrosse, and Northfield\r\nsome years ago, reduce in part to the same thing.[210] Whether the\r\nTroy, Alabama, and Wichita, Kansas, cases belong here or in the next\r\ngroup is indeterminate, owing to the difficulty of comparing conditions\r\nof carriage by rail and by water, respectively.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the set of circumstances shown in diagram B (page\r\n219, _supra_) is of quite a different sort. The justification for\r\nthe local discrimination is much less clear. Here, as before, the\r\ndistant point Y enjoys a lower rate than X because of the presence of\r\ncompetition; but it is important to inquire both as to the nature and\r\nthe amount of it. In the first case, competitive traffic from Y was\r\n_extra_ rather than normal in character, so far as the line serving\r\nX was concerned. It was relatively small in amount. Whatever surplus\r\nrevenue resulted from it aided the local tariffs, including those\r\nat X, in supporting the burden of fixed expenses. This burden they\r\nwere bound to bear entirely in the absence of competitive business\r\npicked up at Y. The distant point Y of course had no complaint in any\r\nevent, and the chances are that X was benefited, as we have seen.\r\nBut in the second case the great bulk of the traffic from Y belongs\r\nnaturally to the direct line through X. It constitutes the mainstay\r\nof its business. The direct line, unlike the roundabout one, cannot\r\nwithdraw from the field when rates become unremunerative. It is in\r\nthis business passing directly through X to stay. Nine-tenths of the Y\r\ntraffic, perhaps, moves through X in this latter case; in the former\r\none, one-tenth would perhaps measure the proportion of the indirect\r\nline. Under this assumption, it is obvious that the question of the\r\nlevel of rates at Y, as determined by the presence of competition,\r\nassumes a ninefold greater importance in the eyes of X, so far as the\r\neffect upon local rates in supporting the fixed and joint expenses of\r\nthe road is concerned. In any event, even the line operating under\r\na disability supposedly earns some small net return on competitive\r\ntraffic, else it would withdraw from the field. This it is in fact free\r\nto do at any time; and, however small the net return, it is at least\r\nall gain. On the other hand, when the net return on a large volume of\r\nits natural business becomes unduly small, the financial stability\r\nof the direct line is put in jeopardy. The danger of local rates (as\r\nat X) being actually enhanced or at least prevented from reduction,\r\nbecause of an unduly low level of competitive rates at more distant\r\npoints, is thus much greater when X is a way station on a direct line\r\nthan when, as in our first instance, it is an intermediate point on\r\na roundabout route. For this reason the direct line through X is at\r\nthe outset put to a justification of its local tariffs, as to whether\r\nthey are inherently reasonable or not; first, by comparison with the\r\ngeneral level throughout the surrounding territory; and, secondly, as\r\nyielding a return on the capital actually invested. This seems to have\r\nbeen the line of reasoning which the Interstate Commerce Commission\r\nadopted in the recent important Spokane, Washington, cases.[211] The\r\nlow through rates to the Pacific coast were established as reasonable\r\nby the competition of sea routes round the Horn, and especially by the\r\nnewly-opened Tehuantepec Railroad. The only ground for finding there\r\nwas discrimination against Spokane was an inherent unreasonableness in\r\nits rate. This was, in fact, the outcome; the decision being rendered\r\nnotable, further, by reason of the prominence given to the valuation of\r\nthe railroads' property as a basis of judgment.\r\n\r\nThe first important point to be established, then, in this second\r\nvariety of the oyster case was as to the relative distribution of\r\ntraffic from the more distant competitive point by the several lines\r\nopen to it. The next concerned the absolute reasonableness of the rate\r\nat the intermediate point. In the third place, we must inquire whether\r\nthe rate at the more distant point may not be unreasonably low. This\r\nwas a contingency not possible, as we have just seen, in the Spokane\r\ncase. But others may be different in this regard. One is thus forced\r\nto consider the effect of the presence of roundabout competitive lines\r\nupon the level of rates at the more distant point. An indirect rival\r\nroad may, as in the St. Cloud case, carry only seventy-three carloads\r\na day as compared with a daily movement of one thousand cars by the\r\ndirect lines. On the other hand, as in the Savannah Freight Bureau\r\ncase, Valdosta, Georgia, may receive nine-tenths of its supply of\r\nfertilizer by indirect roads. But in any event it is the potential,\r\nnot the actual, movement of tonnage, which may count in the long run.\r\nIt is indisputable that the short line between two points never pares\r\nits rates down to an irreducible minimum except under compulsion.\r\nThe presence of a roundabout route affords just this pressure to\r\nreduction. Even allowing that in the last analysis the long line will\r\nstrike bed-rock of no profit first, it is indisputable that such lines\r\nfrequently, instead of merely meeting rates made for them by the direct\r\nroutes, seek to divert business by actually undercutting those rates.\r\nHaving only a small share of the tonnage, they take risks which would\r\nbe fatal to others. To transport at an absolute loss is of course no\r\nmore defensible than the argument of the merchant that the only way\r\nto compensate for selling goods below cost was to enlarge the volume\r\nof his business. But, of course, there is always the chance that, by\r\nenlarging this volume sufficiently, operating expenses may be so far\r\ncut down that a loss may be transformed into a profit. The diversion\r\nof enough traffic from the direct railroad line to accomplish this end\r\nwould, of course, reduce the volume of its traffic and thereby unduly\r\nburden it, to the manifest injury of all local points like X.\r\n\r\nSuggestive illustrations of lower rates at the more distant point\r\nthan are under the circumstances actually \"compelled\" by competition\r\nof routes are to be had. In a recent case[212] the rates on bananas\r\nfrom Charleston, South Carolina, to Danville and Lynchburg, Virginia,\r\nrespectively, were called in question. The traffic moved through\r\nDanville on its way to Lynchburg, sixty-six miles beyond, at a rate\r\nof forty-three cents to Danville as compared with a rate of twenty\r\ncents to Lynchburg. The reason for the low rate at Lynchburg was the\r\npresence of a rival route,--bananas, coming in through Baltimore. But\r\nthe lowest rate \"compelled\" by this competition was in fact thirteen\r\ncents higher than the Danville line charged at Lynchburg. In other\r\nwords, the long-distance rate was that much lower than it need have\r\nbeen. This instance is analogous in another way to our oyster case,\r\ninasmuch as the demand at Danville being limited, one-half of the\r\nsame carload paid the Danville rate of forty-three cents, while the\r\nother half went on at the lower rate of twenty cents enjoyed at the\r\nmore distant point. It is in this connection, of rates unduly low at\r\nso-called competitive points, that the partial weakness in the railroad\r\narguments in many of the southern basing point cases appears. Since the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States had held that competition at the\r\nmore distant point justified its lower rates, the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission was powerless to give effect to whatever opinion it might\r\nentertain that at times it is neither water nor commercial competition\r\nwhich actually brings about the low rate at the basing point; but\r\nmerely a consensus of opinion among carriers that that place will\r\nrespond quickly enough to favors granted, to make it worth while to\r\ntry the experiment.[213] This conviction is vastly strengthened, of\r\ncourse, since entire monopoly among all the southern railroad lines\r\nhas become an established fact. It is an absurdity to speak longer of\r\nany competition between rail carriers existing in a large part of this\r\nterritory.[214]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nActual illustrations of this second variant of the oyster case, free\r\nstill from the complications of competition of markets, are not\r\ncommon, but occasionally arise. Chattanooga, which aspires to be the\r\ncommercial and industrial centre of eastern Tennessee, is about 150\r\nmiles southeast of Nashville, as shown by the accompanying sketch map.\r\nOwing to the southwestern trend of the Appalachian Mountain valleys,\r\nit is only 846 miles from New York by rail, almost as the crow flies;\r\nwhile Nashville has access to the North principally through Ohio river\r\ngateways, over lines, at the best, 1,058 miles in length. By these\r\nlines, therefore, the latter is 212 miles further from New York than\r\nChattanooga. But the two competitive places are only 151 miles apart;\r\nwhence it follows that the shortest possible all-rail line from New\r\nYork to Nashville, swings around to the south by way of Chattanooga.\r\nThe situation is complicated by other combined rail and water routes\r\nfrom New York through Norfolk, Savannah, and Charleston. But all these\r\nlines also reach Nashville by coming up through Chattanooga. From every\r\npoint of view, therefore, Chattanooga, on the basis of mileage, is the\r\nnearer point to New York--151 miles nearer by the direct line, all\r\nrail; equally nearer by all combined rail and water routes: and 212\r\nmiles nearer than is Nashville by the roundabout all-rail lines through\r\nLouisville or Cincinnati. Its location corresponds to X in our second\r\nvariation of the oyster case; namely, an intermediate point on the\r\ndirect line to another more distant point Y, which latter enjoys the\r\ncompetition of more roundabout routes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe disability against Chattanooga, against which it protested, was\r\nsubstantial.[215] Its first-class rate from New York was $1.14 per\r\nhundred pounds, while Nashville paid only ninety-one cents. On various\r\ncommodities the Chattanooga rates were from twenty-five to seventy-five\r\nper cent, above those to Nashville. The effect of such differences\r\nupon jobbing business at the places intermediate between Nashville and\r\nChattanooga is shown by the subjoined chart. The two upper sloping\r\nlines represent the through rates from New York to each distributing\r\ncentre, plus the local rates out to way stations. Even at Bolivar, the\r\nnearest place to Chattanooga, the Nashville combination is slightly\r\nlower than that based upon Chattanooga. This disability steadily\r\nincreases as Nashville is approached, rates from Chattanooga rising\r\nwhile those from Nashville fall, until at Kimbro the jobber located\r\nat Chattanooga--the nearer point to New York on the direct line--must\r\nlay down his New York goods at a rate of sixty-three cents a hundred\r\npounds higher than his competitor in Nashville enjoys. This adjustment\r\nis partly an historical product. Nashville, by the old river routes\r\nfrom Pittsburg down the Ohio and up the Cumberland, was formerly nearer\r\nthe Eastern cities than Chattanooga. Then, the trunk lines through\r\nCincinnati with heavy traffic and low rates shortened the distance;\r\nand, finally, the Louisville & Nashville Railroad, supplanting the\r\nriver routes, undertook to build up Nashville as against Cincinnati\r\nand Louisville. Historically, on the other hand, Chattanooga was long\r\nan unimportant point. It took, as it still does, the same rate from\r\nthe North as prevailed at some twenty-three other southern cities from\r\nAtlanta to Memphis. Here is the crux of the difficulty. The rates\r\nat Nashville must be assumed as historically fixed. Whatever remedy\r\nmay apply must come from a reduction of the rates to Chattanooga,\r\nthe nearer point. This place has now become an important centre, the\r\nmeeting point of a number of rail and water lines. The long prevalent\r\ngrouping of all the southern cities with equal rates from the North\r\nmust be replaced by a system of differentials, if the discrimination\r\nagainst Chattanooga is ever to be ameliorated.\r\n\r\nBy this time it will be observed that in the discussion of the\r\nChattanooga case we have drifted far beyond the mere competition of\r\nrival routes. Commercial competition, which affords the justification\r\nfor grouping all these twenty-three important southern cities together,\r\nis a topic to be treated elsewhere by itself. The difficulty in many\r\nof these cases is to distinguish between the really strongest line and\r\nthe one which is merely the shortest. Upon this point one's decision of\r\nthe Chattanooga case might actually depend. The Louisville & Nashville\r\ncontends that Nashville even today is, from an operating point of view,\r\nnearer New York than Chattanooga, although the distance is 212 miles\r\nmore. All the trunk lines compete at Ohio river points, and bring them\r\nrelatively much closer to New York. The density of traffic on these\r\nlines is far heavier than on the air line to Chattanooga.\r\n\r\nIt happens that Chattanooga meets this allegation of greater trunk\r\nline density and cheapness by proof of the still greater economy\r\nof operation by the coastwise steamers to southern ports, traffic\r\ncoming thence north by rail through Chattanooga. The appearance of\r\nwater competition in any of these cases always introduces an almost\r\ninsuperable difficulty in the way of comparison of long and short\r\nlines. Shipment by vessel differs from rail carriage, primarily in\r\nthe relatively high terminal costs, the absence of all maintenance of\r\nway costs, and the low cost of actual propulsion. With a cargo once\r\nsecurely stowed, the distance traversed by a vessel is of relatively\r\nlittle importance, much less so than in the case of carriage by rail.\r\nA powerful factor in determining water rates, moreover, especially\r\nby sea, is the absence of local traffic. Wharves and terminals being\r\nexpensive to build and maintain, and the method of loading in a ship's\r\nhold not being conducive to ease in access or assortment, vessels\r\nare confined largely to bulk traffic at a few important points. The\r\nexpenses of operation must be more uniformly distributed over the cargo\r\nthan in the case of a trainload. The water line, therefore, is deprived\r\nof one advantage in cutting rates. It cannot, so readily as a railroad,\r\nrecoup itself for losses on competitive business or at competitive\r\npoints by falling back upon its earnings from way stations.\r\n\r\nFrom all these considerations it not infrequently comes about that,\r\nunlike carriage by rail, the longest way round may indeed be the\r\nshortest way home. This is clear in the highly involved Wichita,\r\nKansas, cases.[216] Wichita, a commercial centre of southern Kansas,\r\nis 200 odd miles southwest of Kansas City. Its all-rail rates from\r\nthe East are higher than to Kansas City. Yet by the water route from\r\nNew York to Galveston and thence up by rail, as compared with Kansas\r\nCity, it is a nearer and intermediate point. The Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission well expresses the difficulty:\r\n\r\n    \"It is quite probable that the actual cost of transporting\r\n    cotton piece goods from New York to Wichita _via_ Galveston\r\n    does not exceed that of carrying them from New York to\r\n    Kansas City via the cheapest route. The all-rail haul is to\r\n    the latter point 1,300 miles and over. The ocean and rail\r\n    movement involves a rail carriage of from 1,100 to 1,300 miles,\r\n    depending upon the route selected. If the goods move through\r\n    some Gulf port, there is a rail carriage of not less than 850\r\n    miles. If, therefore, the rate were to be measured by the\r\n    expense of the service, it is probable that Wichita would today\r\n    enjoy as low a rate as the Missouri river.\"\r\n\r\nThe Wichita complication, moreover, works both ways. Wichita and Kansas\r\nCity form two angles of a narrow triangle with its apex at the Gulf\r\nports; but the distance from Kansas City is longer than from Wichita.\r\nRailroad competition brought it about, however, that the rate on export\r\ngrain from Wichita _via_ Kansas City to the Gulf came to equal the\r\nrate from Kansas City to the Gulf _via_ Wichita. But the former was a\r\nmuch longer and more roundabout haul; and, moreover, was less than the\r\nshorter haul rate from Wichita to the Gulf direct. The analogy to the\r\nHillsdale case, above-described, will appear clearly on inspection of\r\nthe map.\r\n\r\nSummarizing the results so far reached, in all that concerns the\r\ntwo sorts of cases considered in the preceding paragraphs, our\r\nconclusion is that, when competition by rail at the distant point is\r\nalone present, and when the nearer point is on a roundabout route, a\r\nrailway \"is entitled to carry the traffic past X to Y (Philadelphia)\r\nfor considerably less than nothing\"; but, when the nearer point is on\r\na direct line, the case is debatable. Proof that normal competition\r\ncompels the lower rate at the remoter station must be uncommonly clear\r\nand conclusive. In other words, the facts that the rate at Y is not\r\nunduly low and also that the rate at X is not unreasonably high must\r\nboth be firmly established.\r\n\r\nA distinct class of cases of local discrimination is suggested by\r\nthe recent case of Montgomery, Ala., in the United States Commerce\r\nCourt.[217] These like other cross line cases, akin to that of Wichita,\r\nKansas, above-mentioned, arise in connection with practices as to the\r\ndivision of joint rates. They will be discussed in connection with\r\npro-rating in our second volume.\r\n\r\nThe question has forced itself forward constantly as to whether the\r\nexistence of the alleged discrimination in rates is merely a matter of\r\nrelativity in cost of operation or whether it inflicts positive injury\r\nupon the nearer point. Would it benefit the nearer point if the lower\r\nrate beyond were withdrawn? It is here that the complexity of some of\r\nthese cases of local discrimination becomes apparent. To understand\r\nthis phase of the matter, the factor of commercial competition, as\r\ndistinct from mere rivalry of routes, must be introduced. Hadley's\r\nanalysis of the oyster case is quite inadequate on this point. Rates\r\nin that instance were on commodities (oysters) produced at practically\r\nuniform cost at both X and Y. They were, moreover, rates _from_ two\r\nplaces out to a common market. Would it, however, make any difference\r\nif the controversy concerned the rates in the opposite direction;\r\nor, in other words, from a common centre of distribution out to two\r\ncompeting consuming points? Would it make any difference whether\r\nthe goods were to be consumed at X and Y; or were to be used as raw\r\nmaterial in manufactures at those two points; or were to be distributed\r\nthroughout the countryside from X and Y as jobbing centres? It is at\r\nonce evident that these issues are more complicated than in the first\r\ncase. The two points X and Y being commercial and industrial rivals, is\r\nit not possible that the growth of one may take place at the expense\r\nof the other? At any given time there is only a fixed demand for the\r\ngoods consumed, manufactured in or redistributed from the two places.\r\nTrade won by one is quite lost to the other. Of course, in a measure,\r\nthis might also have been true of the oyster production. But, inasmuch\r\nas in that case the rate from Y was not affected by the entry of X,\r\nits prosperity would not probably be disturbed. The Hillsdale ice case,\r\nabove described, is also one where the commodity (ice) is of relative\r\nunimportance for Columbus and Springfield, respectively. How would\r\nmatters stand if the rates in question were on lumber or coal for\r\nmanufacturing purposes? The difference, no doubt, is merely of degree\r\nand not of kind. Magnitudes, however, must not deceive us. The rights\r\nof Kathleen or Danville are just as sacred as those of Youngstown and\r\nPittsburg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSt. Cloud, Minnesota, is located upon a line of the Northern Pacific\r\nRailroad, seventy-six miles northwest of St. Paul.[218] It is a\r\ncompetitor not only with St. Paul, but with other local centres in\r\nthe vicinity, like Elk River, Princeton, and Anoka, either for flour\r\nmilling or for distributive jobbing business. It is about the same\r\ndistance as these other places from Duluth or Superior; through which\r\nthe entire district obtains its supplies, such as coal from the East\r\nby lake boats; and by way of which its flour must be shipped to the\r\nEastern markets and to Europe. And yet the rate on flour made at\r\nSt. Cloud to New York in 1899 was twenty-eight and a half cents per\r\nhundredweight, as against a rate of twenty-one and a half cents from\r\nSt. Paul, this latter rate being enjoyed also by Milaca, Princeton,\r\nElk River, and Anoka. The rates on coal and other supplies from the\r\nEast were likewise proportionately higher than to St. Paul and these\r\nneighboring towns. The specific complaint in this case is of local\r\ndiscrimination. The Northern Pacific Railroad operates the long line\r\nbetween St. Paul and the head of Lake Superior by way of Brainerd.\r\nOn this business, passing through St. Cloud, it has to meet a rate\r\ncompelled at St. Paul by the competition of no less than three direct\r\nlines to Duluth. It avers that this business, taken either way for\r\nlonger distances and at lower rates than are accorded to St. Cloud,\r\nin no way affects the rates at that point; and that whatever it can\r\nearn as a contribution to joint expenses decreases the burden of these\r\nupon St. Cloud rates. This is all entirely true from the transportation\r\npoint of view; but, viewed in a large way, the situation is altered.\r\nWheat of local production about St. Cloud is rendered of less value by\r\npractically the excess of the St. Cloud rate per hundredweight over\r\nthe rate enjoyed from St. Paul. The Interstate Commerce Commission\r\nfound that this was equivalent to a difference of fully $1 per acre\r\nin the value of wheat lands tributary to St. Cloud. And on the other\r\nhand, of course, the cost of all its supplies is enhanced above the\r\nlevel of rival manufacturing centres. On soft coal this equalled no\r\nless than eighty-five cents per ton. To this the Northern Pacific\r\nreplied that the discrimination against St. Cloud was not of its\r\ncreation, but had existed before its entry into any St. Paul business\r\nby its indirect route. The Commission found, however, that in fact the\r\nparticipation of this indirect line on St. Paul-Duluth business did\r\naffect the short-line rate; and that its withdrawal would at least tend\r\nto prevent any further reduction of the St. Paul and related rates. If\r\nthe withdrawal did not remove the discrimination against St Cloud it\r\nwould not at all events aggravate it. The vital point, differentiating\r\nthis case from that of the Savannah Freight Bureau, previously stated,\r\nwas the actual damage to the intermediate point due to the existence of\r\ncommercial competition between it and the place more distant.\r\n\r\nAn important feature in commercial competition is its entire\r\ndissociation from all considerations of cost of service by long or\r\nshort routes. Neither strong nor weak lines make the rate. The business\r\nis there. Market conditions are fixed. The carriers are free to take\r\ntraffic or leave it. Single-handed, at least they cannot rule the\r\nprice of transportation. The price of sugar at Kansas City is made\r\nby competition of Louisiana sugar coming from New Orleans, of beet\r\nsugar and Hawaiian sugar from Colorado and San Francisco, and of the\r\nworld's sugar from New York. This is why Kansas City, in the complaint\r\nstated in the opening paragraph, enjoys a lower rate on sugar from San\r\nFrancisco than the transcontinental lines can accord to Denver. The\r\nonly possible justification for the apparent anomaly in lumber rates\r\nfrom Texas points, cited in the same paragraph, is that, as the heart\r\nof the Middle West is approached, lumber supplies from every point of\r\nthe compass converge upon common markets. As is so frequently averred\r\nin such cases, no carrier makes the rate. The rate is made for all of\r\nthem by conditions beyond their control. The only rates, therefore,\r\nwhich it is in their power to fix in some accordance with average costs\r\nof operation, are the rates at local stations. For these rates alone\r\ncan they be brought to book.\r\n\r\nJust here another characteristic of commercial competition as distinct\r\nfrom rivalry of routes is to be noted. Local discrimination, wherever\r\nit is alleged to occur, frequently assumes the form of complaint\r\nagainst rates to various places, not on the same line but by different\r\nand often widely separated lines. Complaints of this class might\r\narise, for instance, referring back to our diagrams of the oyster\r\ncases, between X and Z. Philadelphia, we will assume, as before, to\r\nbe the common market. A multitude of different varieties of protest\r\nare distinguishable. Point X equally distant from Philadelphia with Z\r\nmay pay a higher rate than Z. Or X may be less distant than Z, and yet\r\nbe called upon to pay the same rate. It may even be less distant than\r\nZ and yet actually be charged a higher rate than Z. But in all these\r\ninstances the two points (X and Z) are not on the same route, but on\r\ndivergent routes. The issue remains the same. The conditions imposed\r\nat the point of convergence being fixed, each line must exercise its\r\nown ingenuity in conforming thereto. Methods in each case must differ,\r\naccording to the length of line, the direction and composition of the\r\ntraffic, and other factors.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThree general schemes of rate-making are distinguishable in American\r\npractice. The most satisfactory one is that which obtains in trunk\r\nline territory, of zone tariffs with a gradation in some degree\r\ncorresponding to distance.[219] At the other extreme is the system of\r\nthe flat or postage-stamp rate, exemplified in the Missouri-Mississippi\r\nriver territory,[220] and in Pacific coast rates from all points east\r\nof the Mississippi.[221]\r\n\r\nIntermediate between the two are the systems of basing lines and\r\nbasing points. The first of these, the basing line system, prevails\r\nthroughout the country west of the Missouri river. The second, the\r\nbasing point system, is found throughout the southern states east of\r\nthe Mississippi. In both the principle is the same. The two differ\r\nonly in detail. Through rates are made to certain designated places;\r\nand from there on, a local rate to all other places, large or small,\r\nis added. This local charge rises, of course, with distance. Thus the\r\nfirst-class rate to Denver, Colorado, is made up of a rate of eighty\r\ncents from Chicago to the Missouri river, plus $1.25 for the balance\r\nof the haul. From Chicago to a point in central Nebraska the only\r\ndifference would be a lower local. In southern territory the rate to\r\nTroy, Alabama, equals the sum of the through rate to the nearest basing\r\npoint, Montgomery, and of the local rate from there on to destination.\r\nThe only difference in detail between these two systems is that in\r\nthe western territory, all competing lines being parallel (until\r\nthe routes around by sea and back from the Pacific coast are met),\r\nrates rise in all cases progressively with distance. The complaint of\r\nlocal discrimination rests merely on the allegation that the rate of\r\nprogression with increasing distance is too rapid. In the South, on the\r\nother hand, owing to the encircling seacoast with deeply penetrating\r\nnavigable rivers, the competing routes from the East or North converge\r\nfrom different and even from directly opposite directions. Hence it\r\nis impossible to base rates upon extended boundary lines, like the\r\nMissouri river. Rates must be based upon certain designated points.\r\nThis introduces a serious complication. Points, instead of lines, being\r\nused for basing purposes, in the South, local rates rise outward in\r\nevery direction around each basing centre until the sphere of the next\r\nbasing point is met. And local rates to points even back on the same\r\nline, through which the traffic has already passed to reach the basing\r\npoint, are thus of necessity higher than rates to points beyond.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe economic anomaly of rates actually falling progressively as the\r\nlength of the haul increases is graphically well illustrated in\r\nthe accompanying diagram, based upon data in the Georgia Railroad\r\nCommission cases.[222] The charges from Cincinnati to local points\r\non all lines converging upon Atlanta equal the sum of the rates to\r\nAtlanta plus the local charges out. This holds good even on the direct\r\nline from Cincinnati through Chattanooga, as the diagram shows; yet\r\nof course it also follows that rates must again decline as the next\r\nbasing point is approached in any direction; be it Montgomery to the\r\nwest, Macon to the south, or even Chattanooga to the north. The only\r\ncondition analogous to this in the Far West appears in those places\r\nwhose rates are made up by a combination of the low water rates to the\r\ncoast plus a local back eastward into the mountains. The transition\r\nfrom this Pacific coast combination to the system based upon the\r\nMissouri river occurs at those places where the aggregate charges from\r\neither direction become equal. Viewed as a large matter of principle\r\nthe whole western system is analogous to the southern system. It is\r\ninevitable in both that intermediate points should in all cases be\r\nassessed at a higher rate than those adopted as bases.[223]\r\n\r\nThe reason advanced in support of these basing point or basing line\r\nsystems is that they are an outgrowth of commercial competition; in\r\nother words, that they are compelled by conditions beyond the carriers'\r\ncontrol. Sometimes it may be the competition of widely encircling water\r\nroutes--as from New York around to Galveston and up to Kansas City in\r\nthe southwestern field, or to Mobile and up to Montgomery, Alabama, in\r\nthe southeastern states. But, in many other cases, market competition\r\nfrom other centres of supply set the limit to the rate at the basing\r\npoint. Missouri river cities enjoy a great advantage over all\r\ncompetitors, as meeting places of the ways. Generally, the low rates\r\nto the base points have been originally accorded in order to build up\r\nlocal distributive or industrial centres in the face of competition\r\nfrom older places. Nashville undoubtedly owes a large measure of its\r\npresent prominence to the fact that in the old days its principal\r\nrailroad gave a foothold and made a clientage for its merchants as\r\nagainst older rivals in Cincinnati and Louisville. Nor can it be said\r\nthat this was an injury to that clientage, composed of consumers all\r\nthrough the adjacent countryside. Rates for these consumers were not\r\nput up, in order to build up Nashville. On the contrary, Nashville\r\nwas given perhaps inordinately low rates, in order that the sum of\r\nthese low rates and of the local rates out to Four Corners should be\r\nat least as low as those from Cincinnati and Louisville direct. This\r\nlast argument is the main economic defence of the southern basing point\r\nsystem.[224] It applies equally to the advocacy of a low basing line at\r\nMissouri river cities for rate making to points beyond.[225]\r\n\r\nThe main difficulty with any system of basing points or lines, which\r\nso flagrantly violates the distance principle, is first of all to\r\ndetermine at what points to base; and thereafter to accommodate the\r\nsystem to the normal growth and development of the country. The system\r\nis inelastic. It tends to break down of its own weight. It must\r\nenlarge, if at all, by fits and starts, in each case with violent\r\ndislocation of trade. A generation ago towns in Iowa complained that\r\nthe Mississippi river was a basing line. Then, when the Missouri river\r\nline was substituted, an outcry rose from all the points in Nebraska.\r\nThe persistent complaint from Denver against its rate adjustment as\r\ncompared with Kansas City,--a competitive distributing centre,--well\r\nexemplifies it. The Denver Chamber of Commerce intervenes, and proposes\r\nthat the basing line be moved from the Missouri river out to Colorado\r\ncommon points (like Denver). Indeed, in each case the argument in favor\r\nof the change is identical. Each tier of complainants--thriving cities\r\nwhich have recently come to more or less commercial maturity--plead\r\ntheir inability to compete with the centres adopted some years ago for\r\nbasing purposes. Denver, for example, wishes to sell goods throughout\r\nUtah. But its total charges there on goods purchased in the East amount\r\nto eighty cents from Chicago to the Missouri river, plus $1.25 on to\r\nDenver, plus $1.64 on to destination,--a sum of $3.69 per hundred\r\npounds. The Kansas City dealer, on the other hand, gets a low base\r\nrate of only eighty cents with a single additional rate directly out\r\nto Utah of $2.05. In other words, the latter can lay down his goods\r\nin Utah for $2.85 as against $3.69 paid by the Denver competitor. The\r\npoint to be carried forward, however, is not so much the disparity\r\nagainst Denver, as the fact that the moment Denver is promoted to be\r\na basing point it becomes defendant in a complaint of precisely the\r\nsame sort, brought by the places still further west. This inelasticity\r\nof basing point schemes, together with their inability to expand\r\nwithout abrupt dislocations of trade, is apparent everywhere in the\r\nSouth. Just as Chattanooga complains against Nashville, so the little\r\nintermediate stations between Chattanooga and Atlanta, as our diagram\r\non page 240 showed, become restive under rates of $1.27 as compared\r\nwith a rate twenty-one cents lower charged on to Atlanta. The system of\r\nbasing points or lines may be an inevitable concomitant of industrial\r\nimmaturity; but it is none the less difficult to defend as a permanent\r\nsystem or as one inherently just. And its final relegation to the scrap\r\nheap, in favor of a system of rates graded more or less according to\r\ndistance, is ardently to be desired.[226]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDoes a constant rate applied over a long stretch on the same line\r\nconstitute local discrimination? May the nearer points rightfully\r\nprotest against the fact that equally low rates are accorded to remoter\r\npoints? This is the gist of the controversy in the very suggestive\r\nMilk Rate cases in 1897.[227] Here the conflict of interest between\r\nproducer and consumer is obvious. The city of New York naturally\r\ndesires a wide market from which to draw its supply. On the other hand,\r\nthe nearby producers wish to enjoy the advantages of nearness to the\r\nmarket to the fullest degree. Study of the evolution of rate sheets\r\nclearly shows how such grouping of charges over long distances may be\r\nin the nature of a compromise to avoid actual violation of the long and\r\nshort haul principle. Oftentimes places scattered along over a hundred\r\nmiles of railroad enjoy absolute equality of charges. Obviously, the\r\nton-mile rate steadily falls within such a group with progressive\r\nremoteness. Yet it is an inevitable feature of tariff building.[228]\r\nIt is the kernel of the admirable trunk line rate system. Such an\r\nequalization of rates between points unequally distant from a given\r\ncentre, not infrequently arises in connection with mere competition of\r\ntransportation routes. Referring back to the diagrams on page 219, it\r\nmay happen that a complainant at X, the nearer point, recognizing the\r\ninevitableness of a low rate at Y, may succeed in securing an agreement\r\nthat, while its charges cannot be less than at Y, at least they shall\r\nnot be more. This was all that was asked in the \"rare and peculiar\"\r\ncase of Youngstown, Ohio.[229] But it is apparent that such a solution\r\ndiffers only in degree from those previously discussed. The question of\r\nprinciple remains the same. The roundabout route to New York up back\r\nby way of Youngstown could continue to compete at Pittsburg for as low\r\na rate as on direct shipments, even if it observed the long and short\r\nhaul principle to which the Pennsylvania direct route was committed,\r\nonly by charging much lower rates per ton mile on Pittsburg traffic\r\nthrough Youngstown than was levied on business there originating. This\r\nraises precisely the same question of distribution of joint expenses\r\nbetween local and competitive traffic, already discussed. In certain\r\ncontingencies under the second variety of the oyster cases, such a\r\nsolution might apply. Would Chattanooga, for example, assuming it to\r\nbelong in the second class of oyster cases, be contented with an\r\nequality of through rates with Nashville, leaving its local rates out\r\nto smaller towns as they are?\r\n\r\nThe most extreme instance of uniform or postage-stamp rates applied\r\nover long distances occurs in the transcontinental tariffs from\r\ndifferent points in the East. These differ radically from the\r\nadjustment of rates between different points on the Pacific slope,\r\nalready described. At the far western end the lowest rates are accorded\r\nto coast cities, because of water competition by sea. Rates to interior\r\npoints progressively rise by the addition of locals inward toward the\r\ninterior. The rates thus compelled by water competition are accepted\r\nby the all-rail lines. Thus the Pacific coast end is practically built\r\nupon a basing line. It might be expected that in consequence of water\r\ncompetition by sea a similar system would prevail at the eastern end\r\nof the line; that rates to the Pacific coast from interior cities\r\nwould rise progressively according to distance inland, until at all\r\nevents the direct all-rail charge became as low as by the combined\r\nrail-and-water rates. But such is not the case, and for two reasons.\r\nThe first is that in the East interior cities are large and powerful\r\nfactors in trade. There were no such interior cities in the Far\r\nWest, until Spokane came into its own. These inland eastern cities,\r\nPittsburg, for example, demanded equality of opportunity with the\r\nseaboard cities in Pacific coast trade. They succeeded in obtaining it\r\nby a grant of as low rates as New York or Boston enjoyed. In the second\r\nplace, all the Pacific coast carriers enjoy monopoly as far east as the\r\nMissouri river. But east of that line there are many routes interested\r\nin middle western cities, but having no interest in those in the East.\r\nThey, too, have insisted upon giving their clients in such places as\r\nSt. Louis and Chicago as low rates as Philadelphia or New York. Little\r\nby little the equality of rates was extended until for many years\r\nthe blanket rate has covered the entire United States east of the\r\nMississippi river.\r\n\r\nDoes not this constitute local discrimination against the middle\r\nwestern cities? This was one of the main contentions in the St. Louis\r\nBusiness Mens' League case. Being one thousand miles nearer San\r\nFrancisco, it demanded recognition of that fact in its tariffs. The\r\ndifficulty is accentuated when both eastern and western point rates\r\nare considered together. St. Louis enjoys no lower rate than New\r\nYork, although one thousand miles further east; and inland points in\r\nthe Rocky mountain area may be one thousand miles further east than\r\nSan Francisco and yet pay a higher rate. Thus it is possible to lop\r\noff one thousand miles at each end of the line without affording any\r\nrecognition of it in the tariffs. The situation is too involved to\r\ndiscuss in detail in this place; but one finds it difficult to avoid\r\nthe conclusion that the whole system will demand revision before\r\nlong. Geographical conditions are immutable. Trade conditions are\r\nnot. Perhaps it was inevitable that the former should by force of\r\ncircumstances have been somewhat overlooked during a period of rapid\r\ngrowth. But, as commercial affairs approach a condition of stability\r\nand permanence, the matter will call for most careful examination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nConstant rates applied over long distances on the same line almost\r\ninevitably tend to pass over into a system of equality of rates over\r\n_different lines_.[230] The necessity was evident enough in the\r\nMilk Rate case. This phase of the matter may theoretically best be\r\ndiscussed by reference to the following diagram. Suppose A, B, C, and\r\nD to represent any four inland \"common points.\" It remains to show\r\nhow it comes about that they all finally enjoy equal rates to all\r\nfour seaports, regardless of location. Each appears to be naturally\r\ntributary to some one of the seaports by a dominant or short-line\r\nroute. In each instance this route properly rules the rate. Moreover,\r\nthe four seaports may be considered for traffic purposes as equally and\r\ninterchangeably distant from one another without regard to location.\r\nThis follows from the fact that, except in extreme instances, rates\r\nby water do not vary according to distance, so small is the cost of\r\nmere propulsion by comparison with the terminal costs. In other words,\r\nthe rate is the same from Wilmington to Brunswick or Savannah as to\r\nits next neighbor Charleston. From this it follows, further, that\r\nWilmington, Savannah, and Brunswick can all reach B--the point to which\r\nCharleston is nearest--on even terms. They may each have a direct line\r\nto B; but, as compared with a possible combined low water rate to\r\nCharleston and a low direct rail rate inland to B, the Charleston route\r\nmay be at least able to hold its own. All three outside competitors,\r\nthen, are on even terms with one another in respect of access to B.\r\nBut how does Charleston stand towards B as against the field? We have\r\nalready concluded that a roundabout route must be allowed to meet,\r\nthough not to undercut, the ruling rate. Such a roundabout route from\r\nWilmington on this diagram to its own natural tributary A could be, and\r\nas a matter of fact is, made by passing around by way of Charleston\r\nor any other seaport. Charleston wishes to share in this trade at A,\r\nand may reach it by similar tactics. It stands towards A precisely\r\nas Wilmington stands towards B. They finally agree to enjoy both A\r\nand B on even terms. But, as we have already seen, the admission of\r\nWilmington to B is equivalent to the admission of all the rest. Whence\r\nit comes about that all four establish B as a \"common point.\" And of\r\ncourse the same procedure fixes all the others, A, C, and D in the same\r\nway. In the Savannah Fertilizer case[231] it appeared that there were\r\nno fewer than 148 points in ten states from Louisiana to Kentucky,\r\nto which rates on fertilizers were absolutely the same from each of\r\nthe four seaports. The degree of local discrimination of course was\r\nnegligible at the remoter places; but it augmented in proportion as the\r\nimmediate neighborhood of each seaport was approached. The apparent\r\nanomaly was greatest in a north and south direction along the seacoast.\r\nThus Dinsmore, Florida, was 275 miles from Charleston and only 160\r\nmiles from Savannah, yet the rates from both points were the same. The\r\ngoverning feature usually was the entire equality of coastwise water\r\nrates, regardless of distance, which in turn compelled the land lines\r\nto follow suit.\r\n\r\nThe Cincinnati Freight Bureau case, otherwise known as the Maximum\r\nFreight Rate case,[232] affords the best example of the difficulty in\r\npractice of adjusting rates over different and widely separated lines\r\non a distance basis, in order to satisfy the demands of commercial\r\ncompetition. Atlanta, Georgia, the key to the southern market, is 876\r\nmiles by rail from New York, but only 475 miles from Cincinnati and 733\r\nfrom Chicago. In other words, Cincinnati is fifty-four per cent. as\r\nfar from Atlanta as is New York; and even Chicago is only eighty-four\r\nper cent. as remote. In general, this valuable southern territory, on\r\nthe basis of mere distance, is really nearer to the leading middle\r\nwestern cities than to those on the Atlantic seaboard. Yet this\r\ngeographical situation is not reflected in the railway tariffs. Rates\r\nfrom the West, especially on manufactures, were much higher, always\r\nrelatively and often absolutely. Thus first-class goods in 1894 paid\r\n$1.47 per hundred from Chicago (733 miles), while from New York\r\n(876 miles) the rate was only $1.14. At points like Chattanooga the\r\ndisparity was even greater. This city is only 595 miles from Chicago\r\nas against 1,060 miles from Boston. Yet the rates were actually lower\r\n($1.14) from New England than from Chicago ($1.16). The principal\r\nreason for this of course was the cheap coastwise water competition\r\nby way of Charleston and Savannah. The eastern all-rail routes could\r\ncharge no more than the combined rail-and-water lines. The difference\r\nin relative cost of operation by water was recognized by means of\r\nso-called \"constructive mileage.\" From New York to Savannah by sea is\r\nabout 750 miles; yet the allowance to the steamers was proportioned\r\nupon a distance of only 250 miles. Water cost was thus fixed by\r\ncomparison with rail cost in the proportion of one to three. Yet, even\r\nwith this allowance in favor of eastern cities, New York remained more\r\ndistant from Atlanta than Cincinnati; the \"rate-making\" distance from\r\nthe former being 538 miles as against only 475 miles from Cincinnati.\r\nThe arbitrary reduction of the New York distance left Chicago more\r\nremote (733 miles), but not in so great degree as its tariffs implied.\r\nThese tariffs were also peculiar in another regard. The handicap\r\nagainst the western cities was much higher in respect of manufactures\r\nand high-class freight than upon foodstuffs and raw produce. This in\r\nturn was clearly due to a long-established agreement between the lines\r\neast and west of the Alleghanies, as to a division of the field.\r\nOriginally each set of lines was harassed by roundabout competition\r\nfrom the other. Western foodstuffs and raw produce were reaching the\r\nSouth by way of the Atlantic seaboard; and eastern manufactures from\r\nNew York, for instance, were rambling about over western lines in order\r\nto reach places like Atlanta and Augusta, naturally served by direct\r\nroutes from the East. The agreement to divide the field, dating from\r\n1878, steadily became more irksome, however, to the West, with the\r\ndevelopment of manufactures of its own. The problems raised by this\r\nchange are too large to be considered here. The main question for\r\nthe present inquiry is as to the relative fairness of rates from two\r\nwidely separated centres to a common market, those rates not being\r\nproportioned to distance. The final settlement of this knotty question\r\nis suggestive of the extreme difficulty of attempting to apply mileage\r\nor distance rates over different railroads too rigidly. The complaint\r\nbeing as to relativity, there were only two possible solutions.[233]\r\nOne was to increase the eastern rates, the other to order a reduction\r\nof the charges from the West. The former course was impossible, owing\r\nto the presence of water competition by sea, not under control. The\r\nlatter alternative was, therefore, chosen by the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission in its decision in 1894. The rates from western cities were\r\nalways composed of two parts. The charge from the Ohio south was kept\r\ndistinct as a local rate. The other portion of the rate applied from\r\nChicago, for example, down to the Ohio river. Of these two parts, the\r\ntrunk line portion appeared reasonable enough. It was the southern\r\nlocal, often one hundred per cent. higher than the other, which seemed\r\nmost unreasonable; and which, according to all appearances, had been\r\nused to bring about a closure of the market to western manufactured\r\ngoods. Consequently the Commission ordered a reduction of the southern\r\nlocal rates, cutting them drastically, but leaving the northern\r\nlocals unchanged. This decision was never carried into effect; as\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States held the Commission to have\r\nno such rate-making power. Nothing was done apparently to remedy the\r\ndisparity in charges against the West, although the railroads serving\r\nthat territory urgently pressed for action. Every time they threatened\r\na reduction of their western rates, the eastern line came down in\r\nproportion. This left the relative rates as before, although the\r\ngeneral scale would be lower all round.\r\n\r\nAt last, in 1905, the eastern lines from Baltimore south agreed to\r\npermit a reduction of five cents in the rates from western cities by\r\nlines _north_ of the Ohio river; but they refused to accede to any\r\nchange in the rates from the Ohio south. This was the exact opposite\r\nof the Interstate Commerce Commission's proposition, although both\r\nplans were intended to compass the same object; namely, to place\r\nwestern shippers more nearly on a parity with the East. The Commission,\r\nin 1894, laid all reduction upon the southern portion of the rate;\r\nthe railroads, in 1905, placed it all upon the northern part. This\r\nobviously afforded no relief to the original complainant, Cincinnati.\r\nIn fact, it actually operated to its great disadvantage, inasmuch as it\r\nlet its two powerful rivals, Chicago and St. Louis, into the southern\r\nfield on distinctly more favorable terms. Such was the outcome as a\r\nresult of the friction of railroad competition. The reasonableness of\r\nsome reduction was clear. But to the layman, the fairness of laying the\r\nreduction entirely upon the northern locals, already relatively low,\r\ninstead of upon the extremely high southern part of the rate is not by\r\nany means so clear.[234]\r\n\r\nOne further detail of this adjustment of southern rates raises a\r\nquestion:\r\n\r\n    \"Rates between Richmond, Virginia, and Atlanta, Georgia, are\r\n    less than the rates between Richmond, Virginia, and Greenwood,\r\n    South Carolina (an intermediate point). This is due to\r\n    indirect competition between Richmond and Western jobbing\r\n    points; and in order to permit the jobber or manufacturer\r\n    in Richmond to do business as against his competitor in\r\n    Cincinnati, it has been necessary to fix the rates from\r\n    Richmond to Atlanta with some reference to the rates from\r\n    Cincinnati to Atlanta. At Greenwood, South Carolina, we find\r\n    that the Cincinnati shipper pays a very much higher rate than\r\n    to Atlanta, and that the rates from Richmond are already\r\n    sufficiently low to enable the Richmond shipper to compete at\r\n    Greenwood with the Cincinnati shipper.\"[235]\r\n\r\nIs this not in a measure well described in the passage, \"unto him that\r\nhath shall be given; but from him that hath not, shall be taken away\r\neven that which he hath\"? This railway argument contains dangerous\r\npossibilities. In effect, upon the theory of charging what the traffic\r\nwill bear, it means that a railway (in this case the Seaboard Air\r\nLine) may increase its own local rates, not in proportion to the\r\nlength of its own haul (from Richmond to Greenwood), but according\r\nto the remoteness of that local point from another competing market.\r\nThe inevitable effect of the general adoption of such a policy must\r\nbe to erect arbitrary barriers to the free and widespread movement\r\nof commerce. The great advantage of the flat rate or of commodity\r\nrates is that, placing all competing centres upon an absolute parity\r\nirrespective of distance, they encourage the utmost freedom of trade.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCertain general conclusions seem to be warranted by the analysis\r\nof these cases of local discrimination. The first is that they all\r\nshow the extreme delicacy of commercial adjustment and the existence\r\nof conditions well beyond the control of the carriers, jointly or\r\nsingly. Trade jealousies in particular--the rivalry of producing and\r\nconsuming centres--render relativity of rates of paramount importance\r\nto shippers. This class in the community is interested comparatively\r\nlittle in the absolute level of rates, that being more directly the\r\nconcern of the general consuming public. To the public, as represented\r\nby State and Federal legislatures, it is difficult to make these\r\ncomplicated matters of commercial competition clear. The only basis\r\nof rate making that is easily understood is one founded in general\r\nupon the distance principle, or, in other words, correlated with\r\nconsiderations of cost of operation. Any departure from this basis is\r\napt to breed suspicion, and at all events puts the carrier upon the\r\ndefence. It is bad policy, in their own interest, for railroads to\r\npermit a continuance of such violations of the distance principle in\r\ntheir general tariffs (commodity rates as a special resource to meet\r\nthe special needs of commercial competition may be set aside), except\r\nin extreme cases. This was recognized by the trunk lines when they\r\nalmost unanimously acquiesced in the long and short haul provisions of\r\nthe Act of 1887. The people of the United States have the same right\r\nthat they had then, to expect that at the earliest possible moment\r\nthe wise provisions of the trunk line rate adjustment shall be widely\r\naccepted in the West and South. Whether those regions, and the railways\r\nthat reach them, have yet sufficiently developed to warrant the change\r\nis a matter requiring careful consideration in detail.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of some exercise of governmental control over these\r\ncarriers of the country, in order to mitigate, if not to eliminate,\r\nlocal discrimination as far as possible, is evident. Many of the\r\ninstances previously cited have clearly shown how impossible it\r\noften is for any railroad, single-handed, to deal with an involved\r\nsituation in a large way. Take the Cincinnati Freight Bureau case, for\r\ninstance. Conceding, as many would, the claim of western cities to some\r\nreadjustment of tariffs in their favor, is it not an anomaly that the\r\nlines south from Baltimore, several hundred miles away, should finally\r\ndictate the means to be employed to remedy the situation at Cincinnati\r\nand Chicago? Who else but the Federal government could ever hope to\r\ndisentangle the almost hopeless snarl of competition involved in the\r\ncontroversy over differentials to and from the Atlantic seaboard?[236]\r\nThis controversy is at bottom one of local discrimination. And yet\r\nhow is the Interstate Commerce Commission to aid in the solution of\r\nthese intricate problems under present conditions? Its hands formerly\r\ndoubly tied, are now in part freed by rehabilitation of the long and\r\nshort haul clause. But it cannot yet deal with minimum rates, nor is\r\nit clear that it can prescribe differential rates.[237] True, the\r\ncommission may, in some cases, accomplish by indirection its purpose of\r\nestablishing a proper relativity between rates through the exercise of\r\nits newly granted power to fix maximum rates. This, as we shall see,\r\nwas done in the recent Spokane and Denver decisions. Holding that the\r\ncharges at interior points were out of line with through rates to the\r\nPacific coast; and being unable to govern the long-distance tariffs,\r\nit simply ordered a reduction of certain rates at Spokane and Denver\r\nas inherently unreasonable. This solution is not, however, always\r\npracticable. Not infrequently the lower rate at the remoter point will\r\ndrop as soon as the intermediate rate is lowered. Thus the former\r\nrelativity of charges is re-established on a generally lower scale. The\r\ncomplaint in the Eau Claire lumber case required the exercise of such\r\npower over minimum rates, in order to remove the disability against a\r\nparticular centre. And then, finally, it is indubitable that commercial\r\ncompetition as a \"compelling\" factor has been somewhat over-emphasized\r\nby the railroads. Too often conditions in part brought about by\r\nthemselves, or in which at least they have acquiesced, have been set up\r\nas a defence for rates favoring certain points. This is especially true\r\nof the southern basing point cases.[238] Whether any further grant of\r\npowers to the Interstate Commerce Commission by Congress is necessary\r\nat this time in order to enable progress to be made in this connection,\r\nit is as yet too soon to predict. The course of affairs for the next\r\nfew years will at all events bear attentive watching.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the case of competition between a direct and a longer, more\r\nroundabout line, which one \"controls\" or fixes the rate? It is an\r\nimportant matter, involving as it does the economic, if not the legal,\r\nright of a carrier to participate in any given traffic. Concerning this\r\nquestion the greatest diversity of opinion prevails. On the one hand,\r\nboth writers[239] and practical railway men[240] aver that the short\r\nline makes the rate, while the long line merely meets the rate thus\r\nmade. This is probably the more prevalent opinion. Yet expert evidence\r\nof an opposite sort is to be had for the seeking. The Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission has repeatedly held that the short line is at\r\nthe mercy of the longer line under certain circumstances;[241] and\r\ntraffic managers not infrequently plead their inability to control rate\r\nsituations in the face of irrepressible, roundabout competition.[242]\r\nThere is evidently a confusion of thinking, or else a loose use of\r\nterms where statements are so conflicting. As a matter of voluntary\r\nagreement among roads, or of prescribed rates under government\r\nregulation, the issue often assumes the form of controversy as to\r\nwhether a road operating under a physical disability shall be permitted\r\nto participate in a given business by a concession in rates or not.\r\nThus in the notable Milk Rate cases it was a question whether roads\r\nwith heavy grades should be allowed to make concessions in rates. This\r\nissue really also underlies the question of enforcement of the long\r\nand short haul clause. In the recent Spokane case the Harriman lines to\r\nSt. Paul asked that they, being long lines, should not be compelled to\r\nreduce their rates to the figure prescribed for the direct Hill roads.\r\n\r\nIt is clear in the first place that \"short line\" and \"long line\" are\r\nmerely used as convenient terms to designate differences in the cost\r\nof operation. This was well put by James J. Hill before the Elkins\r\nCommittee of 1905.\r\n\r\n    \"We will say that the distance from Cincinnati to New York is\r\n    800 miles, and that they haul 800 tons behind one locomotive\r\n    on one per cent. ruling grades. Now somebody else builds a\r\n    road with a 0.3 grade, and he can haul 2,000 tons--twice and\r\n    a half the amount; but that line is 200 miles longer. You can\r\n    see readily that to move a given number of tons the second road\r\n    runs less than half the train miles, so that the farthest way\r\n    round is the nearest way home in that case.\"\r\n\r\nThe problem should really be stated thus in terms of cost not of\r\ndistance. Suppose the roundabout line to be in part or wholly by\r\nwater, as in competition between the transcontinental roads and the\r\nIsthmian or Cape Horn routes, or as between the direct all-rail line\r\nfrom Boston to Nashville, Tenn., and the steamer line from Boston to\r\nSavannah, and thence up to Nashville by rail. In such cases the rail\r\nlines allow the water routes a differential or constructive mileage in\r\nrecognition of their relatively cheaper per mile expenses of operation.\r\nThe differential may sometimes exist, where, judging by the bulk of\r\ntraffic the advantage, irrespective of the differential, lies with\r\nthe line giving the lower rate. In other words, as measured by volume\r\nof business, the stronger line and not the weaker one enjoys the\r\nbenefit of the differential. This is the case in the coastwise traffic\r\nbetween Atlantic and Gulf ports; where the bulk of the tonnage goes\r\nby steamer and at lower rates than by all-rail lines. The difficult\r\npoint to settle in all such cases is whether the allowance is made as a\r\nvoluntary _concession_ to the roundabout line because it _costs_ more\r\nto operate; or whether it is a toll or tribute, because, irrespective\r\nof the cost, the long line rate is made on the basis of value of\r\nservice. The problem, then, resolves itself into this: how far in\r\npractice does cost of operation really \"control\" the rate in cases of\r\ncompetition between two lines differently circumstanced in this regard?\r\nIf cost is of fundamental importance, the \"short line,\" using the term\r\nas above said in a figurative sense, \"controls\" the rate. If cost is\r\nan entirely secondary matter, rates being made in accordance with\r\nconsiderations of value of service, the \"long line\" holds the upper\r\nhand, and the short one is at its mercy.\r\n\r\nIt is important, moreover, in the comparison of costs of operation,\r\nto keep in view the interrelation between fixed charges and operating\r\nexpenses. This point is often neglected. Any well-considered outlay\r\nupon permanent improvements, of course, increases fixed charges\r\naccording to the extent of the new capital investment; but at the\r\nsame time it presumably lessens the direct cost of operation. The\r\ninterest upon funds spent for heavier rails, reduction of grades,\r\nstraightening of curves, better terminals or heavier rolling stock,\r\nmust be set over against the direct economies resulting from heavier\r\ntrain loads, lessened expenditure for wear and tear, for accidents and\r\nclaims or for wages. This relation between current expense and capital\r\ncost was clearly emphasized in an arbitration decision by the late S.\r\nR. Blanchard, already cited in another connection. Two roads were in\r\ncompetition for business at New Orleans. One had costly but convenient\r\nterminal facilities. The other was so far from the heart of the city\r\nthat the drayage expenses were an important item. This second railway\r\nbegan by offering free cartage to shippers in order to even up with\r\nits more favored competitor; but this soon gave way to the practice of\r\nprivate teaming by shippers with an allowance on the freight bill for\r\n\"drayage equalization.\" The other road objected to this on the ground\r\nthat it constituted a virtual rebate; that in other words the weaker\r\nline was taking business at an abnormally low rate. The arbitrator,\r\nhowever, upheld the practice, on the ground that the heavier operating\r\nexpense for cartage was merely an alternative for increased interest\r\ncharges, had the road elected to construct costly and more convenient\r\nterminals. One road virtually paid money for team hire, the other paid\r\nit in interest on bonds.\r\n\r\nAnalyzing the main question two propositions are certain. Firstly,\r\nthe long line can never charge _more_ than the short line; whence it\r\nfollows that as the short line reduces its rate, the long one must\r\naccept that rate as made; and, secondly, the long line, costing more\r\nto operate, is, in the process of reduction of rates, bound to be\r\nthe first to strike the bed-rock of cost incident to that particular\r\nservice. To go below this point of particular cost would obviously be\r\nindefensible from every point of view. The general rule, then, is that\r\n\"the short line rules the rate.\" This is accepted widely in practice,\r\nas for example throughout trunk line territory and between the\r\nso-called Missouri-Mississippi river points, where the short line from\r\nHannibal to St. Joseph determines all rates by longer routes.[243] But\r\nthe problem yet remains unsolved. The long line may never be able to\r\ncharge _more_ than the short line--may it, however, charge _less_ under\r\ncertain conditions? The moment it is enabled to do so, the long line\r\nand not the short line, for the moment, \"controls the rate.\" If, now,\r\nwe use the technically proper terms, the question becomes this: Under\r\nwhat circumstances is average cost of service in railway competition\r\nset aside in favor of other considerations; or, otherwise stated, when\r\nmay a line, operated under a disability as to cost, properly give\r\na lower rate than its competitors notwithstanding? Does disability\r\njustify a handicap or the reverse? This was the form which the question\r\nassumed in the notable Milk Rate case: as to whether the weaker lines\r\nin respect of distance or grades should be allowed compensation\r\ntherefor by permission to charge higher rates.\r\n\r\nOne of the common instances of rate control by a line operating\r\nunder a disability as to distance or normal cost is the competition\r\nof a bankrupt with a solvent property. The \"roundabout\" line, like\r\nthe Erie or the old New York and New England, having repudiated its\r\nfixed charges, undoubtedly \"makes\" the rate which the other roads must\r\nmeet or lose the traffic. Usually they prefer to absorb or control\r\nit otherwise, financially, thus substituting monopoly for a ruinous\r\ncondition of competition. Yet such instances resolve themselves,\r\nevidently, into questions of relative cost of operation after all. The\r\nbankrupt road holds the whip hand, because, having repudiated its fixed\r\ncharges, its average costs of operation are correspondingly reduced.\r\nThe validity of operating cost as a basis of charges is surely not\r\nshaken by this exceptional case.\r\n\r\nThe relative proportions and the distribution of local and through\r\ntraffic upon two lines of differing length in competition with one\r\nanother are primary factors in determining the ability of either one\r\nto \"make the rate.\" This is, of course, especially true under the\r\noperation of any long and short haul law, under which any reduction\r\nof the competitive rates would necessitate a lowering of the charges\r\nat intermediate points. No road is going to sacrifice lucrative rates\r\nupon a large volume of local traffic unless it can gain either a large\r\nvolume of business or a very long haul from a competitive point.\r\nMany of the notorious rate disturbers in our industrial history have\r\nbeen \"short cut\" roads--the shortest lines between given important\r\npoints, regardless of the nature of the intervening territory--like\r\nthe old New York and New England, the Erie or the Canada Southern.\r\nOther roads, like the Chicago Great Western or the Central Vermont,\r\nwere more roundabout, and yet enjoyed but little local business,\r\ndepending almost exclusively for their livelihood upon long hauls\r\nbetween termini. On the Central Vermont at one time, through business\r\nconstituted seventy-nine per cent. of the total; and only five per\r\ncent. was strictly local in origin. On the other hand, the Louisville\r\n& Nashville, in its original petition for exemption from the long\r\nand short haul clause, stated that eighty per cent. of its income\r\nwas derived from local business. This consideration, as applied to\r\ncompetition between the two primary trunk lines, may not be without\r\nsignificance. As compared with the Pennsylvania Railroad, rich in\r\nlocal business, the New York Central, running along the narrow Mohawk\r\nand Hudson valleys, has not inaptly been described as operating\r\n\"between good points, but not through a good country.\" Under a strict\r\nenforcement of the long and short haul clause, the dilemma on the\r\nformer road would be more serious than on the latter. To choose\r\nbetween its rich local traffic in iron and steel or coal and the long\r\nhaul business from the West, would be a more difficult matter for the\r\nPennsylvania, than for the New York Central management to weigh its\r\nthrough grain business against the local traffic from interior New York\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nIn one way the persistence of locally high rates in the South and West,\r\nirrespective of the low charges at competitive points, is defensible on\r\nthe ground that local business is scanty.[244] The roads cannot live\r\nupon it. Their mainstay is the long-distance traffic from important\r\npoints.[245] On the other hand, where there is no obligation to\r\nmaintain a distance tariff, of course the road with rich local business\r\nenjoys a great advantage in making rates at competitive points. It\r\ncan practically subsist upon its revenue from its own particular\r\nconstituency, meeting all its fixed charges thereby; and can afford to\r\ncut rates on the competitive tonnage down to the bone. Such a road,\r\nquite irrespective of the length of its line, would obviously \"control\"\r\nthe rate at competitive points, as against any rival without such a\r\nsubsidiary and independent source of income.[246]\r\n\r\nVolume of traffic is another fundamental element in the determination\r\nof cost of operation. No matter how short the line or how easy its\r\ncurves and grades, unless it can handle its tonnage in large bulk\r\nit will operate at a disadvantage. Hence a most important factor to\r\nbe reckoned with, in deciding which of two competing lines is in a\r\ncommanding position as to rates, is the volume of traffic, both in\r\ngross and as susceptible of concentration on either line. In the\r\nnotable Chattanooga case, for example, although the line from New York\r\nto Nashville, passing around to the south by way of Chattanooga, is\r\n212 miles shorter than the lines _via_ Cincinnati or Louisville, the\r\nlatter, by reason of the density of traffic in trunk line territory,\r\nseem to stand at least on an even footing. On the other hand, the\r\nenjoyment of the bulk of the tonnage sometimes places its possessor\r\nat the mercy of a petty rival. The Fall River water line to New York,\r\ncarrying an overwhelming preponderance of the business, obviously could\r\nnot afford to cut rates to prevent the Joy Line from stealing a small\r\nportion of the traffic. The same principle holds good in other lines\r\nof business. The Standard Oil Company can better afford permanently to\r\nconcede a small fraction of business to a small independent dealer,\r\nso long as he knows his place and refrains from ambition to enlarge,\r\nrather than to attempt to drive him out entirely by cutting prices on a\r\nhuge volume of business. Occasionally independents are shrewd enough to\r\ntake advantage of this; and so to distribute their business that they\r\nshall in no single place menace a powerful rival, and yet comfortably\r\nsubsist on the gleanings over a wide area.[247] In no single locality\r\nare they important enough to exterminate, at the cost of cut rates\r\napplied to a large volume of business; and yet in the aggregate they\r\nmay make quite a fair livelihood. The only difference between the\r\nstatus of a railway and other lines of business in this regard is\r\nthat the railway may not be quite so free to deploy its forces. Its\r\nterritory and tonnage are more definitely circumscribed by physical\r\nconditions of location.\r\n\r\nA point to be noted in this same connection is the relative stability\r\nof the traffic. Is it concentrated in a few hands or does it arise\r\nfrom many scattered sources? In the former case either road by making\r\na bold stroke may so entirely capture the business that, by reason\r\nof the enhanced volume, a handicap in operation may be overcome.\r\nThus, in the notable instance of trunk line competition for the beef\r\ntraffic some twenty years ago, the Grand Trunk, although much more\r\nroundabout, besides being handicapped in other ways, by securing\r\n_all_ the business, could afford to make rates impossible under other\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nWhether the business in question is natural or normal to a road, or\r\nis an extra, diverted from other more direct lines, is still another\r\nfactor of importance affecting ability to compete successfully for any\r\ngiven traffic. The best statement of this is found in the argument\r\nof J. C. Stubbs before the Arbitration Board on Canadian Pacific\r\nDifferentials in 1898.[248] \"These are differentials in favor of\r\nweaker lines--lines which upon the merits of their service cannot\r\nsuccessfully compete for the business, but claim a share of it as the\r\nreward of virtue, the price of maintaining reasonable rates.... For\r\nexample, the Canadian Pacific road was not projected or built for\r\nthe purpose of developing, fostering, or sharing the carrying trade\r\nbetween San Francisco and the eastern part of the United States....\r\nAfter they were built and the various connections made, then, and not\r\nuntil then, it was seen that there was a business opened. The route\r\nhaving been opened, the newer and longer lines entered the field of\r\ncompetition against the older, shorter, and more direct lines by\r\ncutting the latter's rates.... In a fight of this kind, paradoxical\r\nas it may seem, the stronger line always got the worst of it.... The\r\nweaker or longer line, not having any business at the outset, had\r\nnothing to lose. Everything was gain to it, which appeared to show\r\nan earning above the actual cost of handling the particular lot of\r\nfreight. Quite a distinction between that and the average cost of\r\nhandling all business. Such an unequal warfare could not long continue,\r\nand the common result was that the stronger line sought for terms, and\r\nultimately bought the weaker line off, ... this class of differentials\r\nis and always has been obnoxious.\"\r\n\r\nOur final conclusion must therefore be that the outcome in cases of\r\nunequal competition in respect of cost of operation can seldom be\r\npredicted with certainty. Everything depends upon local circumstances\r\nand conditions. Sometimes the long line and sometimes the short line\r\nwill dominate. Careful analysis of every feature of the business\r\nmust be made before positive affirmation is possible. This result is\r\nat all events worth noting. A due appreciation of the complexity of\r\nthe business of rate making may safeguard us against the cocksure\r\nstatements of the novice, who has never closely examined into the\r\nsubject. President Taft has recently emphasized the need of expert\r\nservice in the field of customs and tariff legislation. It is greatly\r\nto be hoped that a similar appreciation of the care with which railway\r\nlegislation should proceed may prevail at Washington during the present\r\nsession of Congress.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[200] Cullom Committee, Report, Testimony, p. 532. _Cf._ instances in\r\nHudson's Railways and the Republic; and Parson's Heart of the Railway\r\nProblem as showing popular misunderstanding.\r\n\r\n[201] Senate (Elkins) Committee Report, 1905, p. 1892.\r\n\r\n[202] Pp. 116-117.\r\n\r\n[203] Another instance is afforded by the Savannah Freight Bureau case:\r\n7 Int.

It is important also because of the\r\nmarked tendency toward the adoption by various state legislatures of\r\nthe extreme opposite principle of a rigid distance tariff. The old\r\nproblem of effecting a compromise between these two extreme theories\r\nby some form of long and short haul clause--the original section 4 of\r\nthe act of 1887 having been emasculated by judicial interpretation--is\r\nagain brought to the front. For these reasons it may be worth while\r\nto consider certain results which inevitably follow the widespread\r\nacceptance of this principle of the blanket rate. Its benefits are\r\nindeed certain; namely, an enlargement of the field of competition, and\r\nan equalization of prices over large areas, and that too at the level\r\nof the lowest or most efficient production. But these advantages entail\r\ncertain consequences--of minor importance, perhaps, but none the less\r\ndeserving of notice.\r\n\r\nThe subordination of distance to other factors in rate making is a\r\nlogical derivation from the theory of joint cost. This theory justifies\r\nthe classification of freight, namely, a wide range of rates nicely\r\nadjusted to what the traffic in each particular commodity will bear,\r\nwhile always allowing each to contribute something toward fixed and\r\njoint expenses. In the same way it explains a close correlation of\r\nthe distance charge to what each commodity will bear. It assumes\r\nthat any rate, however low, which will yield a surplus over expenses\r\ndirectly incidental to the increment of traffic and which thus\r\ncontributes something toward indivisible joint costs, serves not\r\nonly the carrier by increasing his gross revenue, but at the same\r\ntime lightens the burden of fixed expenses upon the balance of the\r\ntraffic. This principle of joint cost, so clearly set forth by\r\nProfessor Taussig,[250] is fundamental and comprehensive. It pervades\r\nevery detail of rate making. But it rests upon two basic assumptions\r\nwhich, while generally valid, are not universally so. In the first\r\nplace each increment of traffic must be new business, not tonnage\r\nwrested from another carrier and offset by a loss of other business\r\nto that competitor. And secondly, each increment of traffic must be\r\n_economically suitable_ to the particular carriage in contemplation.\r\n\r\nThe first of these assumptions fails wherever two carriers mutually\r\ninvade each other's fields or traffic. Each is accepting business at\r\na virtual loss, all costs including fixed charges on capital being\r\ntaken into account, in order to secure the increment of business. Each\r\ngain is offset by a corresponding loss. It is the familiar case of\r\nthe rate war. A less familiar aspect of the matter is presented when\r\ntraffic is disadvantageously carried by two competing roads, each\r\ndiverting business from its natural course over the other's line. The\r\nsum total of traffic is not increased. Each carries only as much as\r\nbefore but transports its quota at an abnormal cost to itself. This\r\nmay, perhaps, swell gross revenues; but by no process of legerdemain\r\ncan the two losses in operating cost produce a gain of net revenue to\r\nboth. And each increase of _unnatural_ tonnage, where offset by a loss\r\nof natural business, instead of serving to lighten the fixed charges,\r\nbecomes a dead weight upon all the remaining traffic. The commonest\r\nexemplification of this is found in the circuitous transportation of\r\ngoods, instances of which will be given later.\r\n\r\nThe second case in which the principle of joint cost fails to justify\r\ncharges fixed according to what the traffic will bear may arise in the\r\ninvasion of two remote markets by one another; or, as it might be more\r\naptly phrased, in the overlapping of two distant markets. A railroad\r\nis simultaneously transporting goods of like quality in opposite\r\ndirections. Chicago is selling standard hardware in New York, while\r\nNew York is doing the same thing in Chicago. Prices are the same in\r\nboth markets. Of course if the two grades of hardware are of unequal\r\nquality, or if they are like goods produced at different cost, an\r\nentirely distinct phase of territorial competition is created. But we\r\nare assuming that these are standard goods and that there are no such\r\ndifferences either in quality or efficiency of production. What is the\r\nresult? Is each increment of business to the railroad a gain to it\r\nand to the community? The goods being produced at equal cost in both\r\nplaces, the transportation charge must be deducted from profits. For it\r\nis obvious that the selling price cannot be much enhanced. The level of\r\nwhat the traffic will bear is determined not, as usual, by the value of\r\nthe goods but by other considerations. The traffic will bear relatively\r\nlittle, no matter how high its grade. The result is that the carrier,\r\nin order to secure the tonnage, must accept it at a very low rate,\r\ndespite the length of the haul.\r\n\r\nThis is the familiar case of the special or commodity rate granted to\r\nbuild up business in a distant market. Special rates confessedly form\r\nthree-fourths of the tonnage of American railways, as has already been\r\nsaid. The assumption is usually made that such traffic is a gain to\r\nthe railways, justified on the principle of joint cost as already\r\nexplained. But does it really hold good in our hypothetical case? There\r\nis a gain of traffic in both directions, to be sure. But must it not\r\nbe accepted at so low a rate that it falls perilously near the actual\r\noperating cost? It is possible that even here it may add something to\r\nthe carriers' revenue, and thereby lighten the joint costs in other\r\ndirections. But how about the community and the shipping producers?\r\nAre any more goods sold? Perhaps the widened market may stimulate\r\ncompetition, unless that is already keen enough among local producers\r\nin each district by itself. The net result would seem to be merely that\r\nthe railroads' gain is the shippers' loss. There is no addition to, but\r\nmerely an exchange of, place values. Both producers are doing business\r\nat an abnormal distance under mutually disadvantageous circumstances.\r\nIt may be said, perhaps, that the situation will soon correct itself.\r\nIf the freight rates reduce profits, each group of producers will\r\ntend to draw back from the distant field. This undoubtedly happens in\r\nmany cases. But the influence of the railway is antagonistic to such\r\nwithdrawal. It is the railway's business to widen, not to restrict,\r\nthe area of markets. \"The more they scatter the better it is for the\r\nrailroads.\" \"Keep everyone in business everywhere.\" And if necessary\r\nto give a fillip to languishing competition, do so by a concession in\r\nrates. Is there not danger that with a host of eager freight solicitors\r\nin the field, and equally ambitious traffic managers in command, a good\r\nthing may be overdone, to the disadvantage of the railway, the shippers\r\nand the consuming public?\r\n\r\nAn objection to this chain of reasoning arises at this point. Why need\r\nthe public or other shippers be concerned about the railways' policy\r\nin this regard? Is not each railway the best judge for itself of the\r\nprofitableness of long-distance traffic? Will it not roughly assign\r\nlimits to its own activities in extending business, refusing to make\r\nrates lower than the actual incidental cost of operation? And are not\r\nall low long-distance rates, in so far as they contribute something\r\ntoward joint cost, an aid to the short haul traffic? The answer will in\r\na measure depend upon our choice between two main lines of policy; the\r\none seeking to lower _average_ rates, even at the expense of increasing\r\ndivergence between the intermediate and the long distance points, the\r\nother policy seeking, _not so much lower rates as less discriminatory\r\nrates_ between near and distant points. In the constant pressure for\r\nreduced rates in order to widen markets it is not unnatural that the\r\nintermediate points, less competitive probably, should be made to\r\ncontribute an undue share to the fixed sum of joint costs. The common\r\ncomplaint today is not of high rates but of relative inequalities as\r\nbetween places. It is a truism to assert that it matters less to a\r\nshipping point what rate it pays than that its rate, however high,\r\nshould be the same for all competing places. This immediately forces\r\nus to consider the consumer. What is the effect upon the general level\r\nof prices of the American policy of making an extended market the\r\ntouchstone of success, irrespective of the danger of wastes arising\r\nfrom overlapping markets? That the result may be a general tax upon\r\nproduction is a conclusion with which we shall have later to do. Such\r\na tax, if it exists, would go far to offset the profit which unduly\r\nlow freight rates in general have produced. In short, the problem is\r\nto consider the possible net cost to the American people of our highly\r\ninvolved and most efficient transportation system. Our markets are\r\nso wide, and our distances so vast, that the problem is a peculiarly\r\nAmerican one.\r\n\r\nHaving stated the theory of these economic wastes, we may now proceed\r\nto consider them as they arise in practice. Concrete illustration of\r\nthe effect of disregard of distance naturally falls into two distinct\r\ngroups. Of these the first concerns the circuitous carriage of goods;\r\nthe second, their transportation for excessive distances. Both alike\r\ninvolve economic wastes, in some degree perhaps inevitable, but\r\nnone the less deserving of evaluation. And both practices, even if\r\ndefensible at times, are exposed to constant danger of excess. It will\r\nbe convenient also to differentiate sharply the all-rail carriage from\r\nthe combined rail and water transportation. For as between railroads\r\nand waterways, the difference in cost of service is so uncertain and\r\nfluctuating that comparisons on the basis of mere distance have little\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nRecent instances of wasteful and circuitous all-rail transportation are\r\nabundant. A few typical ones will suffice to show how common the evil\r\nis. President Ramsay of the Wabash has testified as to the roundabout\r\ncompetition with the Pennsylvania Railroad between Philadelphia and\r\nPittsburg by which sometimes as much as fifty-seven per cent. of\r\ntraffic between those two points may be diverted from the direct route.\r\n\"They haul freight 700 miles around sometimes to meet a point in\r\ncompetition 200 miles away.\"[251] Chicago and New Orleans are 912 miles\r\napart, and about equally distant--2,500 miles--from San Francisco.\r\nThe traffic manager of the Illinois Central states that that company\r\n\"engages in San Francisco business directly _via_ New Orleans from the\r\nChicago territory, and there is a large amount of that business, and we\r\nengage in it right along.\"[252] Wool from Idaho and Wyoming may move\r\nwest 800 miles, to San Francisco; and thence _via_ New Orleans over the\r\nSouthern Pacific route to Boston.[253] This case, therefore, represents\r\na superfluous lateral haul of nearly a thousand miles between two\r\npoints 2,500 miles apart. The Canadian Pacific used to take business\r\nfor San Francisco, all rail, from points as far south as Tennessee and\r\nArkansas, diverting it from the direct way _via_ Kansas City.[254]\r\n\r\nGoods moving in the opposite direction from San Francisco have been\r\nhauled to Omaha by way of Winnipeg, journeying around three sides of a\r\nrectangle by so doing, in order to save five or six cents per hundred\r\npounds.[255] Between New York and New Orleans nearly one hundred\r\nall-rail lines may compete for business. The direct route being 1,340\r\nmiles, goods may be carried 2,051 miles _via_ Buffalo, New Haven\r\n(Indiana), St. Louis and Texarkana.[256] A generation ago conditions\r\nwere even worse, the various distances by competitive routes between\r\nSt. Louis and Atlanta ranging from 526 to 1,855 miles.[257] New York\r\nbusiness for the West was often carried by boat to the mouth of the\r\nConnecticut river, and thence by rail over the Central Vermont to a\r\nconnection with the Grand Trunk for Chicago. To be moved at the outset\r\ndue north 200 miles from New York on a journey to a point--Montgomery,\r\nAlabama--south of southwest seems wasteful; yet the New York Central\r\nis in the field for that business.[258] The map herewith, prepared in\r\nconnection with the Alabama Midland case, shows the number of lines\r\nparticipating in freight carriage between New York and the little town\r\nof Troy, Alabama. It is nearly as uneconomical as in the old days when\r\nfreight was carried from Cincinnati to Atlanta _via_ the Chesapeake and\r\nOhio, thence down by rail to Augusta and back to destination.[259] It\r\nwas common for freight from Pittsburg to go by boat down to Cincinnati,\r\nonly to return by rail _via_ Pittsburg to New York at a lower rate than\r\non a direct shipment.[260] Even right in the heart of eastern trunk\r\nline territory, such things occur in recent times. The Cincinnati,\r\nHamilton and Dayton prior to its consolidation with the Pere Marquette\r\ndivided its eastbound tonnage from the rich territory about Cincinnati\r\namong the trunk lines naturally tributary. But no sooner was it\r\nconsolidated with the Michigan road than its eastbound freight was\r\ndiverted to the north--first hauled to Toledo, Detroit and even up to\r\nPort Huron, thence moving east and around Lake Erie to Buffalo.[261] In\r\nthe Chicago field similar practices occur. Formerly the Northwestern\r\nroad was charged with making shipments from Chicago to Sioux City via\r\nSt. Paul. This required a carriage of 670 miles between points only\r\n536 miles apart; and the complaint arose that the roundabout rate was\r\ncheaper than the rate by the direct routes. I am privately informed\r\nthat the Wisconsin Central at present makes rates between these same\r\npoints in conjunction with the Great Northern, the excess distance\r\nover the direct route being 283 miles. Complaints before the Elkins\r\nCommittee[262] are not widely different in character. Thus it appears\r\nthat traffic is hauled from Chicago to Des Moines by way of Fort Dodge\r\nat lower rates than it is carried direct by the Rock Island road,\r\ndespite the fact that Fort Dodge is eighty miles north and a little\r\nwest of Des Moines. The Illinois Central, having no line to Des Moines,\r\npro-rates with the Minneapolis and St. Louis, the two forming two sides\r\nof a triangular haul. An interesting suggestion of the volume of this\r\nindirect routing is afforded by the statistics of merchandise shipped\r\nbetween American points which passes through Canada in bond.[263] The\r\nevidence of economic waste is conclusive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA common form of wastefulness in transportation arises when freight\r\nfrom a point intermediate between two termini is hauled to either one\r\nby way of the other. Such cases are scattered throughout our railroad\r\nhistory. One of the delegates to the Illinois Constitutional Convention\r\nof 1870, cites, as an instance of local discrimination, the fact that\r\nlumber from Chicago to Springfield, Illinois, could be shipped more\r\ncheaply by way of St. Louis than by the direct route.[264] And now a\r\ngeneration later, it appears that grain from Cannon Falls, forty-nine\r\nmiles south of St. Paul on the direct line to Chicago, destined for\r\nLouisville, Kentucky, can be hauled up to St. Paul on local rates and\r\nthence on a through billing to destination, back over the same rails,\r\nconsiderably cheaper than by sending it as it should properly go.[265]\r\nThe Hepburn Committee reveals shipments from Rochester, New York, to\r\nSt. Louis, Minneapolis or California, all rail, on a combination of\r\nlocal rates to New York and thence to destination.[266] Presumably the\r\nfreight was hauled three hundred miles due east and then retraced the\r\nsame distance; as New York freight for southern California is today\r\nhauled to San Francisco by the Southern Pacific and then perhaps three\r\nhundred miles back over the same rails. Even if the rate must be based\r\non a combination of low through rates and higher local rates, it seems\r\na waste of energy to continue the five or six hundred miles extra haul.\r\nYet the practice is common in the entire western territory. From New\r\nYork to Salt Lake City by way of San Francisco is another instance in\r\npoint.[267] Of course a short haul to a terminal to enable through\r\ntrains to be made up presents an entirely different problem of cost\r\nfrom the abnormal instances above mentioned.[268]\r\n\r\nCarriage by water is so much cheaper and as compared with land\r\ntransportation is subject to such different rate-governing principles,\r\nthat it deserves separate consideration. Mere distance, as has already\r\nbeen said, being really only one element in the determination of cost,\r\na circuitous water route may in reality be more economical than direct\r\ncarriage overland. Yet beyond a certain point, regard being paid to\r\nthe relative cost per mile of the two modes of transport, water-borne\r\ntraffic may entail economic wastes not incomparable to those arising\r\nin land transportation. In international trade, entirely confined\r\nto vessel carriage, a few examples will suffice for illustration.\r\nMachinery for a stamp mill, it was found, could be shipped from\r\nChicago to San Francisco by way of Shanghai, China, for fifteen cents\r\nper hundredweight less than by way of the economically proper route.\r\nWere the goods ever really sent by so indirect a route?[269] It would\r\nappear so when wheat may profitably be carried from San Francisco to\r\nWatertown, Massachusetts, after having been taken to Liverpool, stored\r\nthere, reshipped to Boston, thereafter, even paying the charges of a\r\nlocal haul of nearly ten miles;[270] or when shipments from Liverpool\r\nto New York may be made _via_ Montreal to Chicago, and thence back to\r\ndestination.[271] I am credibly informed that shipments of the American\r\nTobacco Company from Louisville, Kentucky, to Japan used commonly to go\r\n_via_ Boston. Denver testimony is to the effect that machinery, made\r\nin Colorado, shipped to Sydney, Australia, can be transported _via_\r\nChicago for one-half the rate for the direct shipment; and that on\r\nsimilar goods even Kansas City could ship by the carload considerably\r\ncheaper by the same roundabout route. Conversely straw matting from\r\nYokohama to Denver direct must pay $2.87 per hundred pounds; while if\r\nshipped to the Missouri river, five hundred miles east of Denver, and\r\nthen back, the rate is only $2.05.[272]\r\n\r\nAs a domestic problem, water carriage confined to our own territory has\r\ngreater significance in the present inquiry. Purely coastwise traffic\r\nconditions are peculiar and in the United States, as a rule, concern\r\neither the South Atlantic seaports or transcontinental business. As\r\nto the first-named class, the volume and importance of the traffic is\r\nimmense. Its character may be indicated by a quotation from a railroad\r\nman.\r\n\r\n    \"Now a great deal has been said, chiefly on the outside, about\r\n    the Canadian Pacific Railway seeking by its long, circuitous\r\n    and broken route to share in a tonnage as against more direct\r\n    and shorter lines all rail, and I propose to show to you\r\n    gentlemen that not only have we a precedent on which to claim\r\n    differentials, many of them, and that we also have numerous\r\n    precedents to show that there are numerous broken, circuitous\r\n    water and rail lines operating all over the country that are\r\n    longer and more circuitous than ours, and still they do operate\r\n    with more or less success.... In saying this I do not wish\r\n    to be understood as criticising the right of any road to go\r\n    anywhere, even with a broken and circuitous line, to seek for\r\n    business, so long as they are satisfied that taking all the\r\n    circumstances into account such business will afford them some\r\n    small measure of profit. * * *\r\n\r\n    \"The distance by the Chesapeake & Ohio Road, Boston to Newport\r\n    News, is 544 miles by water; Newport News to Chicago, 1071\r\n    miles, total 1615 miles from Boston to Chicago, against 1020\r\n    miles by the shortest all-rail line from Boston, showing the\r\n    line _via_ Newport News, 58 per cent. longer. The distance by\r\n    the Chesapeake and Ohio from New York to Newport News is 305\r\n    miles, to which add 1071 miles, Newport News to Chicago, total\r\n    1376 miles, against the shortest all-rail line of 912 miles,\r\n    50.87 per cent. longer. Again the distance between Boston and\r\n    Duluth by all-rail is 1382 miles, against 2195 miles _via_\r\n    Newport News and Chicago, 58.82 per cent. longer by the broken\r\n    route.\r\n\r\n    \"The Southern Pacific Co., or System rather, in connection with\r\n    the Morgan line steamers, carries business, _via_ New York, New\r\n    Orleans and Fort Worth, to Utah points at a differential rate.\r\n    The distance from New York to Denver _via_ water to New Orleans\r\n    thence rail to Fort Worth is 3155 miles, against 1940 miles by\r\n    the direct all-rail line, showing it to be longer _via_ New\r\n    Orleans 62.61 per cent.\"[273]\r\n\r\nAllowing a constructive mileage of one-third for the last named\r\nwater haul,[274] many of these even up fairly well with the all-rail\r\ncarriage; although a route from New York to Kansas City by way of\r\nSavannah, Georgia, would appear to be an extreme case, owing to the\r\nrelatively long haul by rail.[275] The increasing importance of\r\nGalveston and the necessity of a back haul to compensate for export\r\nbusiness make it possible for that city to engage in business between\r\nNew York and Kansas City, although the roundabout route is two and\r\none-half times as long as the direct one.[276] As compared with these\r\nexamples, it is no wonder that the competition for New York-Nashville\r\nor New England-Chattanooga business by way of Savannah, Mobile, or\r\nBrunswick, Georgia, is so bitter. The roundabout traffic thus reaches\r\naround by the southern ports and nearly up again to the Ohio river.[277]\r\n\r\nThe second great class of broken rail and water shipments consists\r\nof transcontinental business. Goods from New York to San Francisco\r\ncommonly go by way of New Orleans or Galveston,[278] as well as by\r\nCanadian ports and routes.[279] In the opposite direction, goods are\r\ncarried about 1000 miles by water to Seattle or Vancouver before\r\ncommencing the journey east. But more important, as illustrating this\r\npoint, is the traffic from the Central West which reaches the Pacific\r\ncoast by way of Atlantic seaports. As far west as the Missouri, the\r\nactual competition of the trunk lines on California business has since\r\n1894[280] brought about the condition of the \"blanket\" or \"postage\r\nstamp\" rate. The same competitive conditions which open up Denver or\r\nKansas City to New York shippers by way of New Orleans or Galveston,\r\nenable the Southern Pacific Railroad or Cape Horn routes to solicit\r\nCalifornia shipments in western territory to be hauled back to New\r\nYork, and thence by water all or part of the way to destination.\r\nHow important this potential competition is--that is to say, what\r\nproportion of the traffic is interchanged by this route--cannot readily\r\nbe determined.\r\n\r\nTransportation over undue distances--the carriage of coals to\r\nNewcastle in exchange for cotton piece goods hauled to Lancashire--as\r\na product of keen commercial competition may involve both a waste of\r\nenergy and an enhancement of prices in a manner seldom appreciated.\r\nThe transportation of goods great distances at low rates, while\r\neconomically justifiable in opening up new channels of business,\r\nbecomes wasteful the moment such carriage, instead of creating new\r\nbusiness, merely brings about an exchange between widely separated\r\nmarkets, or an invasion of fields naturally tributary to other centres.\r\nThe wider the market, the greater is the chance of the most efficient\r\nproduction at the lowest cost. The analogy at this point to the\r\nproblem of protective tariff legislation is obvious. For a country\r\nto dispose of its surplus products abroad by cutting prices may not\r\ninvolve economic loss; but for two countries to be simultaneously\r\nengaged in \"dumping\" their products into each other's markets is quite\r\na different matter. In transportation such cases arise whenever a\r\ncommunity, producing a surplus of a given commodity, supplies itself,\r\nnevertheless, with that same commodity from a distant market. It may\r\nnot be a just grievance that Iowa, a great cattle raising state, should\r\nbe forced to procure her dressed meats in Chicago or Omaha;[281] for\r\nin this case some degree of manufacture has ensued in these highly\r\nspecialized centres. But the practice is less defensible where the\r\nidentical product is redistributed after long carriage to and from a\r\ndistant point. Arkansas is a great fruit raising region; yet so cheap\r\nis transportation that dried fruits, perhaps of its own growing, are\r\ndistributed by wholesale grocers in Chicago throughout its territory.\r\nThe privilege of selling rice in the rice-growing states from Chicago\r\nis, however, denied by the Southern Railway Association.[282] An\r\nilluminating example of similar character occurs in the Southern cotton\r\nmanufacture, as described by a Chicago jobber:\r\n\r\n    \"Right in North Carolina there is one mill shipping 60 carloads\r\n    of goods to Chicago in a season, and a great many of these same\r\n    goods are brought right back to this very section.... I might\r\n    add that when many of these heavy cotton goods made in this\r\n    southeastern section are shipped both to New York and Chicago\r\n    and then sold and reshipped South, they pay 15 cents to 20\r\n    cents per hundred less each way to New York and back than _via_\r\n    Chicago. This doubles up the handicap against which Chicago\r\n    is obliged to contend and renders the unfairness still more\r\n    burdensome.\"[283]\r\n\r\nThe overweening desire of the large centres to enter every market is\r\nwell exemplified by recent testimony of the Chicago jobbers.[284]\r\n\r\n    \"A few years later, when the railroads established the relative\r\n    rates of freight between New York and Philadelphia and the\r\n    Southeast, and St. Louis, Cincinnati and Chicago and the\r\n    Southeast, giving the former the sales of merchandise and the\r\n    latter the furnishing of food products, the hardware consumed\r\n    in this country was manufactured in England. At that time\r\n    we, in Chicago, felt that we were going beyond the confines\r\n    of our legitimate territory when we diffidently asked the\r\n    merchants in western Indiana to buy their goods in our market.\r\n    Today, a very considerable percentage of the hardware used\r\n    in the United States is manufactured in the Middle West, and\r\n    we are profitably selling general hardware through a corps\r\n    of travelling salesmen in New York, Pennsylvania and West\r\n    Virginia, and special lines in New England.\r\n\r\n    \"What we claim is that we should not have our territory stopped\r\n    at the Ohio river by any act of yours. It is not stopped,\r\n    gentlemen, by any other river in America. It is not stopped\r\n    by the greatest river, the Mississippi. It is not stopped by\r\n    the far greater river, the Missouri. It is not stopped by\r\n    the Arkansas; it is not stopped by the Rio Grande. It is\r\n    not stopped even by the Columbia; and, even in the grocery\r\n    business, it is not stopped by the Hudson. There are Chicago\r\n    houses that are selling goods in New York city, groceries that\r\n    they manufacture themselves. Mr. Sprague's own house sells\r\n    goods in New York city, and Chicago is selling groceries in New\r\n    England. As I say, even the Hudson river doesn't stop them.\"\r\n\r\nAll this record implies progressiveness, energy, and ambition on\r\nthe part of both business men and traffic officers. Nothing is more\r\nremarkable in American commerce than its freedom from restraints.\r\nElasticity and quick adaptation to the exigencies of business are\r\npeculiarities of American railroad operation. This is due to the\r\nprogressiveness of our railway managers in seeking constantly to\r\ndevelop new territory and build up business. The strongest contrast\r\nbetween Europe and the United States lies in this fact. European\r\nrailroads take business as they find it. Our railroads make it. Far be\r\nit from me to minimize the service rendered in American progress. And\r\nyet there are reasonable limits to all good things. We ought to reckon\r\nthe price which must be paid for this freedom of trade.\r\n\r\nOne further aspect of economic waste may be mentioned, especially as\r\nbearing upon Federal regulation so far as it affects carload ratings\r\nand commercial rivalry between remote middlemen in the large cities\r\nand provincial jobbing interests. The actual cost of handling small\r\nshipments being about one-half that of carriage by carloads, the\r\ncheapest way in which to supply, let us say, the Pacific slope or Texas\r\nterritory, is to encourage the local jobber who ships by carload over\r\nthe long haul. For, obviously, distribution by less-than-carload lots\r\nfrom New York, or even Chicago direct, direct to the cross-road store,\r\nis bound to be a wasteful process by comparison.[285] But in addition\r\nthere are also, of course, the social factors to be considered, which\r\nare of even greater weight.\r\n\r\nThe causes of economic waste in transportation are various. Not\r\nless than six may be distinguished. These are: (1) congestion of\r\nthe direct route; (2) rate cutting by the weak circuitous line; (3)\r\npro-rating practices in division of joint through rates; (4) desire for\r\nback-loading of empty cars; (5) strategic considerations concerning\r\ninterchange of traffic with connections; and (6) attempts to secure\r\nor hold shippers in contested markets. These merit consideration\r\nseparately in some detail.\r\n\r\nCongestion of traffic upon the direct line is a rare condition in\r\nour American experience. Few of our railways are over-crowded with\r\nbusiness. Their equipment may be overtaxed, but their rails are seldom\r\nworked to the utmost. Yet the phenomenal development of trunk line\r\nbusiness since 1897 sometimes makes delivery so slow and uncertain that\r\nshippers prefer to patronize railways less advantageously located, even\r\nat the same rates. The congestion on the main stem of the Pennsylvania\r\nrailway between Pittsburg and Philadelphia is a case in point.\r\n\r\nSpecial rates or rebates often divert traffic. The weak lines, in that\r\nparticular business, are persistently in the field and can secure\r\ntonnage only by means of concessions from what may be called the\r\nstandard or normal rate. The differential rate is an outgrowth of this\r\ncondition. The present controversy over the right of the initial line\r\nin transcontinental business to route the freight at will involves such\r\npractices. The carriers insist that they can stop the evil only by the\r\nexercise of choice in their connections. An interesting recent example\r\nis found in the Elkins Committee testimony. It appears that lumber\r\nfrom points in Mississippi destined for Cleveland instead of going by\r\nthe proper Ohio river gateways was diverted to East St. Louis. The\r\noperation was concealed by billing it to obscure points,--Jewett, Ill.,\r\nnear East St. Louis, and Rochester, Ohio,--and there issuing a new bill\r\nof lading to destination:\r\n\r\n    SENATOR DOLLIVER. And these people carry it up to this little\r\n    station near St. Louis and then transfer it to another station\r\n    near Cleveland?\r\n\r\n    Mr. ROBINSON. Oh, no; to any point on the Central Traffic\r\n    Association territory. In other words, it may go to Cleveland.\r\n\r\n    SENATOR DOLLIVER. Why do they bill it to Rochester?\r\n\r\n    Mr. ROBINSON. In order to get the benefit of keeping it in\r\n    transit fifteen days without any extra cost, first.\r\n\r\n    SENATOR DOLLIVER. I do not see how that would affect the\r\n    question of billing it to Rochester.\r\n\r\n    Mr. ROBINSON. Because that enables the wholesaler to have\r\n    fifteen days extra time in which to sell the lumber.\r\n\r\n    The CHAIRMAN. Why haul it all around the country and then\r\n    reduce the rate on that long haul?\r\n\r\n    Mr. ROBINSON. In order that roads that are not entitled\r\n    naturally to this traffic may by this process get the traffic.\r\n\r\n    SENATOR DOLLIVER. What roads from Mississippi to East St. Louis?\r\n\r\n    Mr. ROBINSON. Any of the trunk lines--the Illinois Central,\r\n    the Louisville or the Southern Railway lines. The roads\r\n    in Mississippi south of the river are not parties to this\r\n    arrangement, you understand. In fact, as fast as they find it\r\n    out they break it up, or try to. They do not want their traffic\r\n    diverted.\r\n\r\n    SENATOR KEAN. Does it not come down to this, that some road is\r\n    trying to cheat another on the use of its cars?\r\n\r\n    Mr. ROBINSON. Not only that, but it is trying to get traffic\r\n    that does not belong to it.[286]\r\n\r\nWherever a large volume of traffic is moving by an unnatural route,\r\nthe first explanation which arises therefore is that rebates or\r\nrate-cutting are taking place.[287]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA third cause of diversion of traffic is akin to the second; and\r\nconcerns the practices in pro-rating. Much circuitous transportation\r\nis due to the existence of independent transverse lines of railway\r\nwhich may participate in the traffic only on condition that it move\r\nby an indirect route. This situation is best described by reference\r\nto the following diagram. Let us suppose traffic to be moving by two\r\nroutes passing through points B and C, and converging on A, which\r\nlast-named point might be Chicago, St. Louis, New York or any other\r\nrailroad centre. Cutting these two converging lines of railway, we\r\nwill suppose a tranverse line passing through B and C. Obviously the\r\nproper function of this railway is as a feeder for the through lines,\r\neach being entitled to traffic up to the half-way point, D. But over\r\nand above serving as a mere branch, this road, desirous of extending\r\nits business, has a powerful incentive to extend operations. The longer\r\nthe tranverse haul, the greater becomes its pro-rating division of the\r\nthrough rate with the main line. Traffic from C is of no profit to the\r\ntranverse road so long as it is hauled directly to A. But if hauled\r\nfrom C to the same destination by way of B, the profit may be enhanced\r\nin two ways. In the first place the pro-rating distance is greater; and\r\nsecondly, such traffic from C not being _naturally_ tributary to the\r\nmain line B A but merely a surplus freight to be added to that already\r\nin hand, the main line A B is open to temptation to shrink its usual\r\nproportion of the through rate in order to secure the extra business.\r\nThis same motive may on proper solicitation induce the other main line\r\nC A to accept traffic from B and its vicinity. The result is a greatly\r\nenhanced profit to the cross line and circuitous carriage of the goods\r\nin both directions around two sides of a triangle. Only recently in a\r\ncase in Texas the Interstate Commerce Commission found that two roads\r\nthus converging on a common point were each losing to the other traffic\r\nwhich rightfully was tributary to its own line. In a recent case,\r\nninety-nine per cent. of the business from Chatham to New York was\r\nmoving over a route 249 miles long, when it might have gone directly\r\nonly 144 miles, by pro-rating with another road.[288] Our illustrative\r\nexamples are not fanciful in any degree.[289]\r\n\r\nThis roundabout carriage becomes of course increasingly wasteful in\r\nproportion to the width of angle between the main lines converging on\r\nthe common point. And several cases indicate that in extreme instances\r\nthe two main lines may converge on a common point from exactly opposite\r\ndirections, while the transverse or secondary road or series of roads\r\nforms a wide and roundabout detour. The well known Pittsburg-Youngstown\r\ncase, cited in the original Louisville & Nashville decision in 1887,\r\nserves as illustration. The Pennsylvania was competing from Pittsburg\r\ndirectly eastbound to New York with certain feeders of the New York\r\nCentral lines which took out traffic bound for the same destination\r\nbut leaving Pittsburg westbound.[290] Other instances of the same\r\nphenomenon occur at Chattanooga, where freight for New York may leave\r\neither northward or southward, at Kansas City and in fact at almost any\r\nimportant inland centre.\r\n\r\nAnother extreme form may arise even in the competition between two\r\nparallel trunk lines cut transversely by two independent cross roads.\r\nOne of these latter may induce traffic to desert the direct route, to\r\ncut across to the other trunk line, to move over that some distance\r\nand then to be hauled back again to a point on the first main line\r\nwhere it may find a \"cut\" rate to destination. Grain sometimes used\r\nliterally to meander to the seaboard in the days of active competition\r\nbetween the trunk lines. Wheat from Iowa and northern Illinois finally\r\nreached Portland, Maine, by way of Cincinnati in this manner, with a\r\nsuperfluous carriage of from 250 to 350 miles:\r\n\r\n    \"Starting within 90 miles of Chicago, though billed due\r\n    northeast to Portland, wheat has travelled first 97 miles due\r\n    southwest to avail of the connection of the Baltimore and Ohio\r\n    Railroad for Cincinnati, and thence north to Detroit Junction,\r\n    a total of 716 miles to reach the latter point and save 5 cents\r\n    in freight. The direct haul through Chicago would have been 340\r\n    miles less, or a total of 376 miles only.\"[291]\r\n\r\nAnother witness describes the route as follows:\r\n\r\n    Property billed for Portland, Me., started 90 miles below\r\n    Chicago, although Chicago is on a direct line, and took a\r\n    southeasterly course, then to Springfield, from Springfield\r\n    to Flora, then to Cincinnati, and then over the Hamilton and\r\n    Dayton system to Detroit, there to take the Grand Trunk road\r\n    to Portland. This was owing to the billing system adhered to\r\n    here with great tenacity. Property ran around three sides of a\r\n    square, and I lost money on some of that property.[292]\r\n\r\nThis ruinous diversion of freight seems to have been dependent upon the\r\nexistence of active competition at Detroit and ceased when the Grand\r\nTrunk came to an agreement with the American lines. But there can be no\r\ndoubt that wherever these cross lines exist there is a strong tendency\r\ntoward diversion. In the recent hearings of the Senate Committee on\r\nInterstate Commerce on railway rate regulation, a railroad witness\r\nagain describes the operation:\r\n\r\n    Mr. VINING. Well, for instance, take the time when I was on\r\n    the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad. Its connection at the\r\n    south was at Fort Wayne, with the Pittsburg, Fort Wayne and\r\n    Chicago Road. We took lumber out of Michigan and wanted to\r\n    send it east. We had to compete with lines that went by way\r\n    of Detroit, that went perhaps through Canada and that in some\r\n    cases were shorter. Of course, if we wanted to send lumber\r\n    from Grand Rapids to New York we had to make at least as low\r\n    a rate as was made by other lines leading from Grand Rapids\r\n    to New York. That rate might be just the same from Fort Wayne\r\n    as from Grand Rapids, so that we could not get any more than\r\n    the low rate from Fort Wayne. We had to go in that case to the\r\n    Pittsburg, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway and say: \"Here are so\r\n    many carloads of lumber, or so much lumber, at Grand Rapids, a\r\n    part of which could be shipped to New York if we had through\r\n    rates that would enable us to move it. These other lines are\r\n    carrying it for 25 cents a hundred pounds to New York. You join\r\n    us in a through rate of 25 cents and we can give you some of\r\n    that business.\" ... But if I were with a short line and wanted\r\n    to negotiate with a long one, I should try to put my case just\r\n    as strongly as possible before the long line. I should say to\r\n    them: \"We can not take 5 per cent. of a rate of 25 cents. It\r\n    would not pay us. You know that; you can see that\"; and they,\r\n    as business men, would admit it. \"Well,\" I would say, \"give us\r\n    5 cents a hundred pounds and we will bring the business to you,\r\n    and if you do not, we can not afford to do it.\"\r\n\r\n    SENATOR CULLOM. I think in some instances they have stated\r\n    before us that they gave 25 per cent.\r\n\r\n    Mr. VINING. They might.[293]\r\n\r\nWhenever the cross road was financially embarrassed, the tendency to\r\ndiversion was increased. For then, of course, having repudiated fixed\r\ncharges, the cross line could accept almost any rate as better than the\r\nloss of the traffic. And that this was in the past almost a chronic\r\ncondition in western trunk line territory appears from the fact that\r\neighteen out of the twenty-two roads cutting the Illinois Central\r\nbetween Chicago and Cairo have been in the hands of receivers since\r\n1874.[294]\r\n\r\nIt not infrequently happens that the initial railroad may entirely\r\ncontrol a roundabout route, whereas shipments by the most direct line\r\nnecessitate a division of the joint rate with other companies. In such\r\na case the initial line will naturally favor the indirect route, at the\r\nrisk of economic loss to the community and even to its own shippers. An\r\ninteresting illustration is afforded by a complaint of wheat growers\r\nat Ritzville in the state of Washington concerning rates to Portland,\r\nOregon.[295] By direct line with low grades along the Columbia river\r\nthe distance was 311 miles. This was composed of several independent\r\nbut connecting links. The Northern Pacific on the other hand had a\r\nline of its own, 480 miles long, which moreover crossed two mountain\r\nranges with heavy grades. It based its charges upon the cost of service\r\nby this roundabout and expensive line; and insisted upon its right to\r\nthe traffic despite the wishes of the shippers. The Commission upheld\r\nthe shippers' contention for the right to have their products carried\r\nto market in the most efficient manner.[296] Another instance on the\r\nIllinois Central is suggestive, concerning shipments from Panola,\r\nIllinois, to Peoria, a distance of about forty miles by the shortest\r\nline of connecting roads. Yet the Illinois Central having a line of\r\nits own _via_ Clinton and Lincoln transported goods round three sides\r\nof a rectangle, a distance of 109 miles, presumably in order to avoid\r\na pro-rating division of the through rate.[297] Of course elements of\r\noperating cost enter sometimes, as in the case of back-loading;[298]\r\nbut in the main, the pro-rating consideration rules.\r\n\r\nRebates may or may not be given in connection with circuitous routing.\r\nSometimes the same result may be obtained when one carrier merely\r\nshrinks its proportion of a joint through rate, leaving the total\r\ncharge to the shipper unaffected. Of course it goes without saying that\r\nan implication of improper manipulation of rates does not always follow\r\nthe diversion of freight from a direct line. The rate may be the same\r\nby several competitive routes, shipments going as a reward for energy,\r\npersistency, or personality of the agent. A recent case, concerning\r\nrates on lumber from Sheridan, Indiana, to New York illustrates this\r\npoint.[299] Sheridan is twenty-eight miles north of Indianapolis on\r\nthe Monon road. Quoting from the decision:\r\n\r\n    \"In the division of joint through rates on percentages based on\r\n    mileage, the defendant line naturally prefers arrangements with\r\n    connections giving it the longest haul and largest percentages.\r\n    Therefore, it carries this freight at rates based on a carriage\r\n    through Indianapolis by a direct line eastward, while in fact\r\n    it carries it in an opposite direction north and west by a\r\n    longer route, the reduced ton mileage being accepted to secure\r\n    the traffic.\"\r\n\r\nThe Iowa Central, cutting across the four main lines between Chicago\r\nand Omaha, derives a large revenue from such diversion. Coal from\r\nPeoria west, instead of moving by the shortest line to Omaha, is hauled\r\nacross the first three to a connection with the devious Great Western\r\nline.[300] The motive is obvious.\r\n\r\nA fourth cause of diversion of traffic has to do rather with the\r\noperating than the traffic department. An inequality of tonnage in\r\nopposite directions may make it expedient to solicit business for\r\nthe sake of a back load. The Canadian Pacific may engage in San\r\nFrancisco-Omaha business by way of Winnipeg, because of the scarcity\r\nof tonnage east bound. The traffic to and from the southeastern states\r\nis quite uneven in volume. The preponderance of bulky freight is north\r\nbound to the New England centres of cotton and other manufacture;\r\nwhile from the western cities, the greater volume of traffic is south\r\nbound, consisting of agricultural staples and food stuffs. To equalize\r\nthis traffic it may often be desirable to secure the most roundabout\r\nbusiness. A disturbing element of this sort in the southern field has\r\nalways to be reckoned with. A good illustration elsewhere occurs in the\r\nwell known St. Cloud case.[301] The Northern Pacific accepted tonnage\r\nfor a most circuitous haul to Duluth, but seems to have done so largely\r\nin order to provide lading for a preponderance of \"empties.\" In this\r\ncase it did not lower the normal rate but accepted it for a much longer\r\nhaul.\r\n\r\nNot unlike the preceding cause, also, is a fifth, the desire to be in\r\nposition to interchange traffic on terms of equality with powerful\r\nconnections. Mr. Bowes, traffic manager of the Illinois Central,\r\njustifying the participation of this road in Chicago-San Francisco\r\nbusiness by way of New Orleans, well stated it as follows:[302]\r\n\r\n    \"Of course the Southern Pacific Railroad, as you gentlemen\r\n    know, originate and control a very large traffic, which they\r\n    can deliver at various junctions; at New Orleans, where they\r\n    have their long haul to the Missouri river, and we naturally\r\n    want some of that business, a long haul traffic to New Orleans,\r\n    and in giving it to them we place them under obligations to\r\n    reciprocate and give us some traffic. That is one of the things\r\n    that occurs to a railroad man as to increasing the volume and\r\n    value of his traffic for the benefit of his company.\"\r\n\r\nA sixth and final reason for diversion of traffic from the direct line\r\nmay be partly sentimental, but none the less significant. It concerns\r\nthe question of competition at abnormal distances. We may cite two\r\nrailroad witnesses, who aptly describe the situation. \"We can haul\r\ntraffic in competition, and we frequently do, as I stated, at less\r\nthan cost, or nearly so, in order to hold the traffic and our patrons\r\nin certain territory--Kansas City for instance--but we do not like to\r\ndo it.\"[303] Or again, \"The Charleston freight is not legitimately\r\nours.... We make on these through rates from Chicago to Charleston, for\r\ninstance, scarcely anything. But it is an outpost. We must maintain\r\nthat or have our territory further invaded.\"[304] In other words, the\r\ncircuitous or over-long distance haul is a natural though regrettable\r\noutcome of railroad competition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat are the effects of this American practice of unduly disregarding\r\ndistance as a factor in transportation? Not less than five deserve\r\nseparate consideration in some detail. It inordinately swells the\r\nvolume of ton-mileage; it dilutes the ton-mile revenue; it produces\r\nrigidity of industrial conditions; it stimulates centralization both of\r\npopulation and of industry, and it is a tax upon American production.\r\n\r\nOne cannot fail to be impressed with the phenomenal growth of\r\ntransportation in the United States, especially in recent years.\r\nIt appears as if its volume increased more nearly as the square of\r\npopulation than in direct proportion to it.[305] But do these figures\r\nrepresent all that they purport to show? Every ton of freight which\r\nmoves from Chicago to San Francisco over a line one thousand miles too\r\nlong adds 1000 ton miles to swell a fictitious total. Every carload\r\nof cotton goods hauled up to Chicago to be redistributed thence in\r\nthe original territory and every ton of groceries or agricultural\r\nmachinery exchanged between two regions with adequate facilities for\r\nproduction of like standard goods contribute to the same end. How large\r\na proportion of this marvellous growth of ton mileage these economic\r\nwastes contribute can never be determined with certainty. That their\r\naggregate is considerable cannot be questioned.\r\n\r\nThese practices must considerably dilute the returns per mile for\r\nservice rendered by American carriers--in even greater degree than they\r\nenhance the apparent volume of transportation. Long-distance rates\r\nmust always represent a low revenue per ton mile, owing to the fixed\r\nmaximum for all distances determined by what the traffic will bear.\r\nFurniture made in North Carolina for California consumption[306] cannot\r\nbe sold there in competition above a certain price. The greater the\r\ndistance into which the possible margin of profit is divided, the less\r\nper mile must be the revenue left for the carrier. Yet this is not all.\r\nSuch would be true of simply over-long distance carriage. But to this\r\nwe must add the fact that some of this long-haul tonnage reaches its\r\nremote destination over a roundabout line, which increases the already\r\nover-long carriage by from twenty-five to seventy-five per cent. It is\r\napparent at once that a still greater dilution of the average returns\r\nmust follow as a result. From 1873 down to 1900 the long and almost\r\nuninterrupted decline of rates is an established fact. Has the volume\r\nof this economic waste increased or diminished in proportion to the\r\ntotal traffic throughout this period? If it is relatively less today,\r\nat a time when ton mile rates are actually rising, it would be of\r\ninterest to know how far such economies offset the real increases of\r\nrates which have been made. Rates might conceivably rise a little, or\r\nat all events remain constant, coincidently with a fall in ton mile\r\nrevenue produced through savings of this sort.\r\n\r\nThe third result of undue disregard of distance is a certain\r\ninelasticity of industrial conditions. This may occur in either of two\r\nways. The rise of new industries may be hindered, or a well-merited\r\nrelative decline of old ones under a process of natural selection\r\nmay be postponed or averted. The first of these is well set forth as\r\nfollows:[307]\r\n\r\n    \"It is always considered desirable to have a long haul, and\r\n    the rates on a long haul should be much less, in proportion\r\n    to distance, than on a short haul. This is a principle of\r\n    rate-making which has grown up as one of the factors in the\r\n    evolution of the railroad business in this country, and it has\r\n    greatly stimulated the movement of freight for long distances,\r\n    has brought the great manufacturing centres in closer touch\r\n    with the consumer at a distance and the producer in closer\r\n    touch with centres of trade. It has been of undoubted benefit\r\n    to both, though it may oftentimes retard the growth of new\r\n    industries by a system of rates so preferential as to enable\r\n    the manufacturer a long distance from the field of production\r\n    of raw material to ship the raw material to his mills,\r\n    manufacture it and return the manufactured goods cheaper than\r\n    the local manufacturer could afford to make it, and thus, while\r\n    building up the centres of manufacture, have retarded the\r\n    growth of manufacturing in the centres where the raw material\r\n    is produced.\"\r\n\r\nThe other aspect of industrial rigidity is manifested through the\r\nperpetuation of an industry in a district, regardless of the physical\r\ndisabilities under which it is conducted. Another quotation describes\r\nit well.[308]\r\n\r\n    SENATOR CARMACK. Is it the policy of the roads, wherever they\r\n    find an industry established, to keep it going by advantages in\r\n    the way of rates regardless of changes in economic conditions?\r\n\r\n    Mr. TUTTLE. I think in so far as it is possible for them to do\r\n    so. It has not been possible in all cases. We could not keep\r\n    iron furnaces running in New England; they are all gone.\r\n\r\nOne cannot for a moment doubt the advantages of such a policy as a\r\nsafeguard against violent dislocating shocks to industry. It may render\r\nthe transition to new and better conditions more gradual and easier to\r\nbear. It has been of inestimable value to New England, as exposed to\r\nthe competition of newer manufactures in the Central West. But on the\r\nother hand, it is equally true that in the long run the whole country\r\nwill fare best when each industry is prosecuted in the most favored\r\nlocation--all conditions of marketing as well as of mere production\r\nbeing considered. If Pittsburg is the natural centre for iron and steel\r\nproduction, it may not be an unmixed advantage to the country at large,\r\nhowever great its value to New England, to have the carriers perpetuate\r\nthe barbed wire manufacture at Worcester.[309] Each particular case\r\nwould have to be decided on its merits. My purpose at present is not to\r\npass judgment on any of them but merely to call attention to the effect\r\nof such practices upon the process of industrial selection.\r\n\r\nIn the fifth place, every waste in transportation service is in the\r\nlong run a tax upon the productivity of the country. More men may be\r\nemployed, more wages paid, more capital kept in circulation; but it\r\nstill remains true that the coal consumed, the extra wages paid and the\r\nrolling stock used up in the carriage of goods, either unduly far or\r\nby unreasonably roundabout routes, constitute an economic loss to the\r\ncommunity. In many cases, of course, it may be an inevitable offset\r\nfor other advantages. In the Savannah Freight Bureau case[310] (map, p.\r\n648, _infra_) Valdosta, Georgia, was 158 miles from Savannah, while it\r\nwas 275 and 413 miles by the shortest and longest lines respectively\r\nfrom Charleston. Valdosta's main resource for fertilizer supplies,\r\nother things being equal, would naturally be Savannah, the nearer\r\ncity. Yet in the year in question it appeared that nine-tenths of the\r\nsupply was actually drawn from Charleston; and much of it was hauled\r\n413 instead of a possible 158 miles. No wonder the complainants alleged\r\n\"that somebody in the end must pay for that species of foolishness.\"\r\nWhenever the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company succeeds in selling goods\r\nof no better grade or cheaper price in territory naturally tributary\r\nto Pittsburg, a tax is laid upon the public to that degree.[311] When\r\nChicago and New York jobbers each strive to invade the other's field,\r\nthe extra revenue to the carriers may be considerable; but it is the\r\npeople who ultimately pay the freight. The analogy to the bargain\r\ncounter is obvious. The public are buying something not necessary\r\nfor less than cost; while the carriers are selling it for more than\r\nit is worth. Economies would redound to the advantage of all parties\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat remedy is possible for these economic wastes? Both the carriers\r\nand the public have an interest in their abatement. The more efficient\r\nindustrial combinations have taken the matter in hand, either by\r\nstrategic location of plants or, as in the case of the United States\r\nSteel Corporation, by the utilization of a Pittsburg base price scheme,\r\nwith freight rates added.[312] But probably the large proportion of\r\ntonnage is still shipped by independent and competing producers. To\r\nthis traffic the railways must apply their own remedies. Either one of\r\ntwo plans might be of service. The right to make valid agreements for\r\na division either of traffic or territory, if conceded to the carriers\r\nby law under proper governmental supervision, would be an effective\r\nsafeguard. This would mean the repeal of the present prohibition of\r\npooling. The amendment of the long and short haul clause in 1910 (p.\r\n601 _infra_) seems likely to do much toward accomplishing the same\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nAgreements between carriers previous to 1887 were often employed to\r\nobviate unnecessary waste in transportation. The division of territory\r\nbetween the eastern and western lines into the southern states is a\r\ncase in point. Thirty years ago competition for trade throughout the\r\nSouth was very keen between the great cities in the East and in the\r\nMiddle West. Direct lines to the northwest from Atlanta and Nashville\r\nopened up a new avenue of communication with ambitious cities like\r\nChicago, St. Louis and Cincinnati. The state of Georgia constructed\r\nthe Western and Atlantic Railroad in 1851 for the express purpose\r\nof developing this trade. As western manufactures developed, a keen\r\nrivalry between the routes respectively east and west of the Alleghany\r\nmountains into the South was engendered. A profitable trade in food\r\nproducts by a natural, direct route from the Ohio gateways was,\r\nhowever, jeopardized by ruinous rates made by the warring trunk lines\r\nto the northern seaboard. Corn, oats, wheat and pork came down the\r\ncoast and into the South through the back door, so to speak, by way\r\nof Savannah and other seaports. On the other hand the eastern lines\r\ninto the South were injuriously affected by the retaliatory rates on\r\nmanufactured goods made by the western lines for shipments from New\r\nYork and New England. Freight from each direction was being hauled\r\nround three sides of a rectangle. Finally in 1878 a reasonable remedy\r\nwas found in a division of the field and an agreement to stop all\r\nabsurdly circuitous long hauls into one another's natural territory. A\r\nline was drawn through the northern states from Buffalo to Pittsburg\r\nand Wheeling; through the South from Chattanooga by Montgomery, Ala.,\r\nto Pensacola. Eastern lines were to accept goods for shipment only\r\nfrom their side of this line to points of destination in the South\r\nalso on the eastern side of the boundary. Western competitors were to\r\ndo the same. The result was the recognition of natural rights of each\r\nto its territory. This agreement has now formed the basis of railway\r\ntariffs into the southern states for almost a generation. Similar\r\nagreements, on a less extensive scale, are commonly used to great\r\nadvantage. Thus in the \"common point\" territory formerly tributary to\r\nWilmington, Savannah and Charleston, the first named city insisted upon\r\nits right to an equal rate with the other two, no matter how great the\r\ndisparity of distance. The Southern Railway and Steamship Association\r\narbitrated the matter, fixing a line beyond which Wilmington was to be\r\nexcluded.[313] Obviously such agreements have no force in law at the\r\npresent time. The only way to give effect to them is for connecting\r\ncarriers to refuse to make a joint through rate. This effectually bars\r\nthe traffic. Moreover entire unanimity of action is essential. Every\r\nroad must be a party to the compact. Otherwise the traffic will reach\r\nits destination by shrunken rates and a more circuitous carriage even\r\nthan before.\r\n\r\nOne cannot fail to be impressed in Austria and Germany with the\r\neconomic advantages of an entirely unified system of operation. No\r\ndevious routing is permitted. Certain lines are designated for the\r\nheavy through traffic, and concentration on them is effected to the\r\nexclusion of all others. Between Berlin and Bremen, for example,\r\npractically all through traffic is routed by three direct lines. No\r\nroundabout circuits occur because of the complete absence of railway\r\ncompetition. No independent lines have to be placated. The sole\r\nproblem is to cause the tonnage to be most directly and economically\r\ntransported. And this end is constantly considered in all pooling or\r\nthrough-traffic arrangements with the railway systems independently\r\noperated.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian pooling agreements with the Bavarian railways are typical.\r\nEach party to the contract originally bound itself not to route freight\r\nover any line exceeding the shortest direct one in distance by more\r\nthan twenty per cent. Compare this with some of our American examples\r\nof surplus haulage of fifty or sixty per cent! And within the last\r\nyear, the renewal of these interstate governmental railway pools in\r\nGermany has provided for a reduction of excessive haulage to ten per\r\ncent. The problem of economical operation in Austria-Hungary with\r\nits mixed governmental and private railways is more difficult. But\r\nno arrangements are permitted which result in such wastes as we have\r\ninstanced under circumstances of unlimited competition in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nA more consistent enforcement of the long and short haul principle\r\nmight provide a remedy almost as effective as pooling. The Alabama\r\nMidland decision nullified a salutary provision of the law of 1887\r\nby holding that railway competition at the more distant point might\r\ncreate such dissimilarity of circumstances as to justify a higher rate\r\nto intermediate stations. Turn to our diagram on page 282 and observe\r\nthe effect. Traffic around two sides of a triangle from A to C by way\r\nof B is carried at a rate equal to the charge for the direct haul from\r\nA to C; or it may be even at a lower differential rate. Complaint\r\narises from the intermediate points y and x of relatively unreasonable\r\ncharges. The roundabout route replies with the usual argument about a\r\nsmall contribution toward fixed charges from the long haul tonnage,\r\nwhich lessens the burden upon the intermediate rate. This is cogent\r\nenough up to a certain point. It might justify a lower rate to D, on\r\nthe natural division of line territory. It might be defensible on\r\nprinciple to accord D a lower rate than x or possibly even than y. To\r\ndeny the validity of lower rates to z or C would however at once follow\r\nfrom the same premises.\r\n\r\nUnder the new long and short haul clause, what may be done by the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission? This body roughly determining the\r\nlocation of D, a natural division point, would then refuse to permit\r\nA B, B C to charge less to either z or C than to any intermediate\r\npoint, x, B or y. Coincidently it would bar the other road A C, C B\r\nfrom any lower through rate to points beyond D, such as x, B or y\r\nthan to any intermediate station. Two courses would be open to the\r\nroads. They must either mutually withdraw from all business beyond\r\nD or reduce their rates to all intermediate points correspondingly.\r\nIn a sparsely settled region with little local business, they might\r\nconceivably choose the latter expedient. But in the vast majority of\r\ncases the roads would prefer to withdraw from the unreasonably distant\r\nfields.[314] Simultaneously taken by each line, such action would put\r\nan end to the economic waste. At the same time it would terminate one\r\nof the most persistent causes of rebates and personal favoritism. To be\r\nsure it would generally operate in favor of the strong, direct lines as\r\nagainst the weak and roundabout ones. Great benefit would accrue to the\r\nPennsylvania, the Illinois Central or the Union Pacific railroads. The\r\nactivities of the parasitic roads and the scope of parasitic operations\r\nby the substantial roads would inevitably be curtailed. Much justice\r\nwould be done and much local irritation and popular discontent would be\r\nallayed.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[249] P. 133, _supra_.\r\n\r\n[250] _Quarterly Journal of Economics_, V, 1891, p. 438.\r\n\r\n[251] Senate (Elkins) Committee Report, 1905, III, pp. 2152-2153.

A few selections from the first and last items of\r\nsuch a document are reproduced on the preceding pages. They give some\r\nidea of the amazing scope of trade. Such a classification is, first of\r\nall, a list of every possible commodity which may move by rail, from\r\nAcademy or Artist's Board and Accoutrements to Xylophones and Zylonite.\r\nIn this list one finds Algarovilla, Bagasse, \"Pie Crust, Prepared\";\r\nArtificial Hams, Cattle Tails and Wombat Skins; Wings, Crutches,\r\nCradles, Baby Jumpers and all; together with Shoo Flies and Grave\r\nVaults. Every thing above, on, or under the earth will be found listed\r\nin such a volume. To grade justly all these commodities is obviously\r\na task of the utmost nicety. A few of the delicate questions which\r\nhave puzzled the Interstate Commerce Commission may give some idea\r\nof the complexity of the problem.[316] Shall cow peas pay freight as\r\n\"vegetables, N. O. S., dried or evaporated,\" or as \"fertilizer\"--being\r\nan active agent in soil regeneration? Are \"iron-handled bristle\r\nshoe-blacking daubers\" machinery or toilet appliances? Are patent\r\nmedicines distinguishable, for purposes of transportation, from other\r\nalcoholic beverages used as tonics? What is the difference, as regards\r\nrail carriage, between a percolator and an everyday coffee pot?\r\nAre Grandpa's Wonder Soap and Pearline--in the light of the claims\r\nput forth by manufacturers, suitable either for laundry or toilet\r\npurposes--to be put in different classes according to their uses or\r\ntheir market price? When is a boiler not a boiler? If it be used for\r\nheating purposes rather than steam generation, why is it not a stove?\r\nWhat is the difference between raisins and other dried fruits, unless\r\nperchance the carrier has not yet established one industry while\r\nanother is already firmly rooted and safe against competition?\r\n\r\nThe classification of all these articles is a factor of primary\r\nimportance in the making of freight rates both from a public and\r\nprivate point of view. Attention has been directed of late to its\r\nsignificance and importance to the private shipper, by reason of the\r\nuse made of it in the advances of freight rates which have taken place\r\nthroughout the country within the past decade. Its public importance\r\nhas not been fully appreciated until recently as affecting the general\r\nlevel of railway charges. So little was its significance understood,\r\nthat supervision and control of classification were not apparently\r\ncontemplated by the original Act to Regulate Commerce of 1887. The\r\nanomaly existed for many years, therefore, of a grant of power intended\r\nto regulate freight rates, which, at the same time, omitted provision\r\nfor control over a fundamentally important element in their make-up.\r\nThe Interstate Commerce Commission, however, assumed jurisdiction over\r\nthe matter: and for more than twenty years, despite doubts expressed by\r\nthe Department of Justice as to its legality, passed upon complaints as\r\nto unreasonable classification without protest even from the carriers\r\nthemselves. Control over it has now been assured beyond possibility of\r\ndispute by the specific provisions of the Hepburn Act of 1910.\r\n\r\nThe freight rate upon a particular commodity between any given points\r\nis compounded of two separate and distinct factors: one having to do\r\nwith the nature of the haul, the other with the nature of the goods\r\nthemselves. Two distinct publications must be consulted in order to\r\ndetermine the actual charge. Although both of them usually bear the\r\nname of a railway and are issued over its signature, they emanate,\r\nnevertheless, from entirely different sources. The first of these is\r\nknown as the Freight Tariff. It specifies rates in cents per hundred\r\npounds for a number of different classes of freight, numerically\r\ndesignated, between all the places upon each line or its connections.\r\nThus the tariff of the New York Central & Hudson River Railroad gives\r\nrates per hundred pounds from New York to several hundred stations,\r\nfor first, second, third, etc., classes. This freight tariff, however,\r\ncontains no mention whatever of commodities by name. The second\r\npublication which must be consulted supplies this defect. This is\r\nknown as the Classification. Its function is to group all articles\r\nmore or less alike in character, so far as they affect transportation\r\ncost, or are affected in value by carriage from place to place. These\r\ngroups correspond to the several numerical classes already named in\r\nthe freight tariff. Thus dry goods or boots and shoes are designated\r\nas first class. Turning back to the freight tariff, the rate from\r\nNew York, for example, to any particular place desired, for such\r\nfirst-class freight, is then found in cents per hundred pounds. It\r\nthus appears, as has been said, that a freight rate is made up of\r\ntwo distinct elements equal in importance. The first is the charge\r\ncorresponding to the distance; the other is the charge as determined by\r\nthe character of the goods. Consequently, a variation in either one of\r\nthe two would result in changing the final rate as compounded.[317]\r\n\r\nA concrete illustration or two may emphasize the commercial importance\r\nof classification. So far as it may be used to effect an increase\r\nof rates, the following case is typical, as given by a Boston\r\nmanufacturer, in evidence before the Senate Committee on Interstate\r\nCommerce in 1905:\r\n\r\n\"From July 15, 1889, to January 1, of this year, the classification\r\n(of carbon black, basis of printers' ink) continued to be once and a\r\nhalf first class in less-than-carload lots, third class in carload\r\nlots, approximately twice the freight required between 1887 and 1889.\r\nMeanwhile, the price had declined.... On January 1 the classification\r\nwas again raised, to class 2, rule 25, an increase of about ten per\r\ncent, in carload lots. Numerous efforts have been made by myself and\r\nothers to have this commodity classified where it belongs, as dry\r\ncolor, but the only result has been the reverse of what we desired; and\r\nthe industry has been and is in a somewhat precarious condition, as we\r\nhave contracted for millions of pounds of black at prices fixed at the\r\npoint of delivery, and had no notice of the raise in freight rate until\r\nsubsequent to its going into operation.\"[318]\r\n\r\nThe Spokane Chamber of Commerce, in these same Senate Committee\r\nhearings, gave an illustration of the use of classification to bring\r\nabout a change of rates without modifying the individual railway\r\ntariff. \"The Pacific Coast Pipe Company started to make wired wooden\r\npipe in the spring of 1900.... There was at that time but one factory\r\nof the kind on the North Pacific coast, located at Seattle.... The\r\nSeattle factory, backed by the big lumber firms on the coast, finding\r\na serious competitor in the Spokane field, got the railways to put\r\nmanufactured pipe under the lumber classification, thus reducing the\r\nrate from Seattle to Spokane from forty-six to twenty cents per 100\r\npounds.... The Spokane factory at once filed a vigorous protest, with\r\nthe result that the railways put back the rate from Seattle to Spokane\r\nto forty-six cents, but established a maximum rate of fifty cents for\r\nSeattle pipe, which, of course, shut off all territory east of Spokane\r\nfrom the Spokane factory.... The remnant of the Spokane factory ...\r\nhas been compelled to shut down, and the entire plant is being removed\r\nto Ballard.\" Whether these facts are exactly as thus informally\r\nstated or not, is by the way. If not done at this time, it is certain\r\nthat similar manipulation of classification rules often enters into\r\ncommercial competition.[319]\r\n\r\nFreight tariffs and classifications are as distinct and independent\r\nin source as they are in nature. Tariffs are issued by each railway,\r\nby and for itself alone and upon its sole authority. Classifications,\r\non the other hand, do not originate with particular railways at all;\r\nbut are issued for them by coöperative bodies, known as classification\r\ncommittees. These committees are composed of representatives from\r\nall the carriers operating within certain designated territories.\r\nIn other words, the United States is apportioned among a number of\r\ncommittees, to each of which is delegated by the carriers concerned,\r\nthe power over classification; that is to say, the right to assign\r\nevery commodity which may be shipped or received to any particular\r\ngroup of freight ratings. This delegation of authority is always\r\nsubject, however, to the right of filing whatever exceptions to the\r\nclassification any railway may choose independently to put in force.\r\nThese exception sheets contain the so-called commodity tariffs, to\r\nbe subsequently described, which stand out in sharp relief against\r\nthe so-called class rates. Such exceptions are independently filed by\r\neach railway at Washington and do not generally form integral parts\r\nof the volume issued by the classification committee, except in the\r\nsouthern states. New editions of these classifications are published\r\nfrom time to time as called for by additions or amendments, the\r\nlatest, of course, superseding all earlier ones. Thirty-seven such\r\nissues have already appeared in series in trunk line and southern\r\nterritory, while fifty have been put forth in western territory, since\r\nthe practice was standardized in 1888. At the present time freight\r\nclassification for all the railways of the United States is performed\r\nmainly by three committees, known as the Official, the Southern and\r\nthe Western, with headquarters, respectively, in New York, Atlanta\r\nand Chicago. Each of these three committees has jurisdiction over a\r\nparticular territory. Thus the Official Classification prevails east\r\nof Chicago and north of the Ohio and the Potomac; the Southern, over\r\nthe remaining part of the country east of the Mississippi; and the\r\nWestern, throughout the rest of the United States. In addition to these\r\nthree primary classifications there is also another, issued by the\r\nTranscontinental Freight Bureau, with headquarters at Chicago. This\r\ncommittee has supervision over classification upon the Pacific coast\r\nbusiness. A number of the states also, notably Illinois, Iowa and most\r\nof the southwestern commonwealths, promulgate state classifications\r\nhaving relation, however, only to local business within their several\r\njurisdictions. These are prescribed by law and represent modifications\r\nto suit peculiar exigencies or to foster local trade ambitions. There\r\nare also a number of other coöperative local railway committees,\r\neach dealing with the special concerns of its own territory, and\r\nrepresenting the joint interests of the railways therein included to\r\nall the world outside. Thus, for instance, Southern Classification\r\nterritory is subdivided into local units, known, respectively, as\r\nthe Southeastern Mississippi Valley Association, the Southeastern\r\nFreight Association, and the Associated Railways of Virginia and\r\nthe Carolinas.[320] But for all practical purposes, so far as the\r\nlarger problems of classification are concerned, our attention may be\r\nconcentrated upon the three principal committees above mentioned.\r\n\r\nSome impression of the wide differences between these three main\r\nclassifications in different parts of the country may be derived from\r\nthe set of excerpts at the head of this chapter. In three parallel\r\ncolumns the alpha and omega of each are reproduced, together with bits\r\nof one of the most complicated schedules, viz., that dealing with\r\nagricultural implements. Even where the same commodities occur in\r\neach classification, the diversity in description, mode of packing,\r\ncarload and other requirements, renders any direct comparison almost\r\nimpossible. The mere fact that the class assignment, as shown at the\r\nright in each column, happens to be the same, as in the case of acetic\r\nacid in barrels or drums which moves both in Official and Southern\r\nClassification territory, third class in less-than-carload lots (_L.\r\nC. L._) and fifth class in carloads (_C. L._), shows nothing at all as\r\nfar as equality of charges is concerned. For, as has been said, this\r\nis only half the statement of the rate. The spread between charges for\r\ndifferent classes yet remains to be determined. The actual relativity\r\nbetween third-class and fifth-class rates, moreover, may be very\r\ndifferent in the two places. In the New York Board of Trade case[321]\r\nthis point was well exemplified. Comparative conditions as to rates in\r\nthe three main sections of the country, as they then existed, were as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n                    RATES IN CENTS PER HUNDREDWEIGHT\r\n\r\n                                                            Canned\r\n                                                   Class     goods\r\n                                                  ------  -----------\r\n                                           Miles  I.  IV. L.C.L. C.L.\r\n  New York to Chicago (Official class'n)    912   75  35   65     30\r\n  Chicago to Omaha (West'n class'n)         490   75  30   28.5   25\r\n  Louisville to Selma (South'n class'n)     490   98  63   63     52\r\n\r\nOn the trunk lines fourth-class rates were thus less than half those\r\ncharged for the first class; in the West they were even lower,\r\nrelatively; while in the South fourth-class rates were about two-thirds\r\nas high as the first-class rates. These differences in the spread\r\nbetween classes, as will be seen, interlocking as they do with a\r\nmultitude of other considerations, are a serious bar to any partial\r\nmodification in the direction of uniformity for the United States as a\r\nwhole. Only by consideration of every factor entering into any given\r\nrate may comparisons safely be entertained.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHistorically considered, the development of freight classification has\r\nbeen much the same in England and the United States. Early railway\r\npractice was an outgrowth of the tariffs in force upon canals and\r\ntoll roads.[322] In America, freight charges were at the outset often\r\narbitrarily fixed by the state legislatures, as conditions precedent\r\nto the grant of charter. In many instances they were based upon the\r\ncustomary performance by wagon, distinguishing between light-weight\r\narticles paying by the cubic foot, and heavy ones for which the tariff\r\nwas based upon weight. Thus in 1827 the charter of the South Carolina\r\nRailroad established its tolls at one half the usual wagon charge. The\r\nSouthern Pacific in local rates on ore into San Francisco followed\r\nalong just below the charges by ox cart. The freight was proportioned\r\nalso according to the length of haul by an arbitrary mileage rate. It\r\nsoon developed, however, that railway rates were unique in the fact\r\nthat not only was there a great increase in the volume of trade, but\r\nalso in the diversity of articles offered for transportations as well.\r\nFar more elaborate classifications were soon seen to be necessary.\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Railroad tariff of 1855, described by\r\nMcPherson,[323] exemplified the primitive traffic conditions then\r\nprevalent. Goods were divided into four classes. The first consisted\r\nof articles of light weight or high value, including, for example,\r\nsuch incongruities as bonnets, tea, and pianos. The remaining three\r\nclasses paid by weight with a descending scale of charges. It is\r\ndifficult to explain why coffee and sugar should be rated lower than\r\nstoves and feathers; or why dry hides and rice should be charged a\r\nhigher rate than cotton yarn and bacon; but it is evident that a rough\r\nclassification according to weight, value, use and cost of service\r\nwas being attempted. There was in addition a considerable collection\r\nof special rates on chosen commodities according to the method of\r\npacking them, whether by barrel, bale or case. And there were also\r\nwhat corresponded to modern commodity rates upon cordwood, lumber,\r\nbricks, and similar goods. This tariff, though primitive, including\r\nno less than three hundred items, was far more elaborate than those\r\ncommonly used at the time. The Louisville & Nashville originally\r\ndistinguished but three classes: one by bulk, another by weight and a\r\nthird applicable to live stock. Poultry was rated by the dozen long\r\nafter the Civil War, with a higher charge for Muscovy than for ordinary\r\nducks. The traffic manager of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul\r\ntestified before the Elkins committee in 1905, that the classification\r\nin Illinois in his youth was printed on the back of a bill of lading\r\nno greater than the size of an ordinary sheet of letter paper, and the\r\npage was not full.\r\n\r\nFrom these modest beginnings the development of classification in the\r\nUnited States was rapid, responding to the ever-increasing intensity\r\nof competition and the spread of markets, particularly after 1875. By\r\nthe middle of the eighties most of the large railways were working\r\nunder six or eight different classifications. It began to be apparent\r\nthat some check must be placed upon such increasing complexity. For\r\nconditions were wellnigh intolerable, with one set of rules for\r\nIllinois, and yet another west of Buffalo, divided into eastbound and\r\nwestbound sections, with still a third on westward shipments local to\r\nterritory between Chicago and the Missouri river. The first attempt\r\nat a systematic scheme was made in 1882, but the agreements then made\r\nproved unstable. By 1887 conditions had become insupportable, so great\r\nwas the number and the diversity of the classifications throughout the\r\ncountry.[324] Some applied to local business only, and were peculiar to\r\neach road. Some applied only to westbound business, others to eastbound\r\ntraffic. The traffic manager of the New York Central & Hudson River\r\ntestified before the Interstate Commerce Commission that there were at\r\none time 138 distinct classifications in trunk line territory alone.\r\nThe case of the Wabash in 1883 was typical. A shipper desiring to\r\ndetermine freight rates over that road might be compelled to consult a\r\nclassification for the middle and western states in six classes; one\r\nfor the Southern Railway & Steamship Association territory in eighteen\r\nclasses; one for Mississippi valley business in five classes; one\r\nknown as the Revised Western in nine classes; the Trunk Line East in\r\nthirteen classes; the Trunk Line West in five classes; a classification\r\nfor Texas points in eight classes; and two for the Pacific coast,\r\naccording to direction, in eight and nine classes, respectively. This\r\nsituation, rendering it almost impossible for any shipper to determine\r\nin advance what his freight rates were going to be, as well as what\r\nhis competitor was paying, early impressed itself upon the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission. And it was doubtless due in part to its initiative\r\nthat classifications were shaken down into substantially their present\r\ngeneral form in 1888.\r\n\r\n                     NUMBER OF RATINGS IN 1909[325]\r\n\r\n                          Less than Carload   Carload\r\n  Southern Classification           3,503       703\r\n  Western Classification            5,729     1,690\r\n  Official Classification           5,852     4,235\r\n\r\nThe natural growth of classification in a rapidly developing country\r\nlike the United States, has manifested itself in three distinct ways:\r\nthere has been a steady increase in the number of items of freight\r\nseparately enumerated; a growing distinction in rates between carload\r\nand less-than-carload shipments; and a steadily enlarging volume of\r\nthe most elaborate special rules and descriptions. As for the mere\r\nincrease in distinct commodities enumerated, in the East in 1886\r\nthere had come to be about 1,000. The first Official Classification\r\nin the following year increased to 2,800 items; and by 1893, in the\r\neleventh issue, there were twice that number. The latest Official\r\nClassification, No. 34 in 1909, contained approximately 6,000 separate\r\nenumerations--not many more, in fact, than fifteen years earlier.\r\nThe point of saturation, or else the limit of human ingenuity, seems\r\nto have been about reached some years ago. The same thing was true\r\nof the Western Classification. In 1893 this contained 3,658 items,\r\nrepresenting an increase of about 2,000 over the number of commodities\r\nclassified by name in 1886. By 1909, as the above figures show, it\r\ncomprehended 5,729, almost as many separate items, in fact, for\r\nless-than-carload lots as were recognized in trunk line territory.\r\nOnly in carload ratings is the Western Classification less extensive.\r\nThe Southern Classification reflected somewhat simpler trade conditions\r\nprevalent south of the Ohio river, by the relatively smaller number\r\nof articles enumerated; but it should be added that the number of\r\nexceptions--filling no less than 160 pages in the latest issue--is\r\nindicative throughout of a lesser degree of standardization than is\r\nfound elsewhere. Perhaps the most striking feature of the southern\r\nsystem is the very small proportion of carload rates. But it should\r\nbe noted in this connection that the basing point system afforded\r\npreference to market towns in any event; so that jobbers in such places\r\ndid not need wholesale rates to the same degree. This phase of the\r\nmatter will be elsewhere discussed.[326]\r\n\r\nThe second natural tendency in the development of classification\r\nabove mentioned, is an increase in the number of separate ratings for\r\nlarge and small shipments. The normal growth of trade ought to make\r\npossible a steady increase in shipments by the carload, rather than by\r\nthe box, barrel, or case; and the increase in the number of separate\r\ncarload ratings--always, of course, at a reduced rate by comparison\r\nwith less-than-carload lots--conforms territorially to the growth\r\nin the volume of trade. In 1877, even in trunk line territory, only\r\ntwenty-four commodities were accorded a special carload rate.[327] By\r\n1880 the number had increased to 50, and seven years later to 160.\r\nJust before the passage of the Act to Regulate Commerce there was no\r\ndistinction between carload and small lots in eighty-five per cent.\r\nof the articles enumerated. A sudden change supervened in the first\r\nOfficial Classification issued after the Federal Act. The number of\r\ncarload ratings was suddenly raised to 900, provoking a storm of\r\nprotest from eastern shippers who resented this advantage accorded to\r\njobbers in the West and South, because it enabled the latter to buy\r\ntheir supplies directly at wholesale.\r\n\r\nThe dispute between dealers in the older and newer commercial\r\ncentres came to a head in the so-called New York Board of Trade and\r\nTransportation case of 1888, elsewhere discussed. Yet notwithstanding\r\nthis protest of jobbers and manufacturers in eastern trade centres,\r\nwho insisted that they should be permitted to compete on even terms\r\nwith provincial jobbers by making their shipments direct from New\r\nYork or Boston in small lots as cheaply as the local jobber could buy\r\nthem by the carload, the number of separate carload ratings steadily\r\naugmented year after year. By 1893 more than half of the articles\r\nenumerated in the Official Classification were allowed a lower rate for\r\nlarge shipments. Present conditions are set forth by the statistics\r\nin the preceding paragraph. From these it appears that in trunk line\r\nterritory nearly three-fourths of the commodities now enjoy carload\r\nratings; while in the South, on the other hand, only about one-fifth\r\nof them make such distinction between carload and less-than-carload\r\nlots.[328] One reason is evident; namely, that throughout a large part\r\nof the South few jobbers command a business of sufficient magnitude to\r\nmake use of carload shipments. It is but recently, to take a specific\r\nillustration, that business has developed in volume sufficient to\r\npermit of the shipment of fly paper in carload lots. Until such time no\r\ndistinction between large and small shipments could well be made.\r\n\r\nConditions in the West, according to these figures, are intermediate\r\nbetween those in the East and the South. On the other hand,\r\ntranscontinental business, as carried on in competition with ocean\r\nsteamers, is almost entirely confined to shipment by the carload. The\r\nTranscontinental Classification is unique, therefore, in offering but\r\nvery few opportunities for shipment by package, except under specially\r\nonerous conditions.\r\n\r\nThe spread, in other words, between the two sorts of carriage operates\r\nmost unfavorably by contrast upon the intermountain centres. Denver,\r\nfor example, under the Western Classification enjoys no carload rates,\r\nwhile competitors at San Francisco have a large number.[329]\r\n\r\nA much more elaborate code of rules and regulations having reference to\r\nlocal practices and conditions is the third accompaniment of the growth\r\nof trade.[330] Prior to 1887, and again before the recent revival of\r\ninterest in uniform classification, conditions had become intolerable\r\nin this regard. All sorts of details, covering relatively unimportant\r\ndifferences in conditions of carriage, bill of lading contracts,\r\nmarking and packing, led to constant confusion and annoyance,\r\nespecially in cases of shipment from one classification territory to\r\nanother. An eastern shipper of iron bolts, having in mind that a gunny\r\nsack is equivalent to a box or barrel in the East, orders a small\r\nshipment in a bag to a far western point. He finds that bolts in bags\r\nunder the rules of the Western Classification, are specially enumerated\r\nonly for carload lots, and that he must pay a rate one class higher\r\nfor such shipment than if contained in a barrel, box or keg. This\r\ndifference in classification may more than absorb his profit. Recent\r\nevidence before the Interstate Commerce Commission,[331] contained a\r\nstriking illustration of such local diversity in rules and descriptions\r\nas applied to furniture.\r\n\r\n    \"_Western class_: 'Bank, store, saloon and office furniture,\r\n    consisting of arm rails, back bar mirrors, bottle cases,\r\n    chairs, counter-fittings, desk, foot rails, metal brackets for\r\n    arm and foot rails, refrigerators, tables and work boards.\r\n    Note--Door, window and bar screens, partitions, prescription\r\n    cases, patent medicine cases, show cases, wall-cases,\r\n    wainscoting, office railing and wooden mantels may be shipped\r\n    with bank, store, saloon or office furniture in mixed carloads\r\n    at third-class, minimum weight 12,000 lbs.\r\n\r\n    \"There is no such provision as this in the Official\r\n    Classification. On the contrary, a shipment of that kind can\r\n    only be made by figuring out the less-than-carload rate on each\r\n    article, many of which take first, double first and even three\r\n    times first ratings.\r\n\r\n    \"For example, mirrors over five feet in length are classified\r\n    double first class in the official classification, while show\r\n    cases, set up, take three times first. The natural result\r\n    of this difference in classification has been to shut out\r\n    competition of eastern dealers in these articles entirely in\r\n    Western Classification territory.\"\r\n\r\nOnly in a customs tariff of the United States would one expect to find\r\nany such complexity as is discoverable in railway documents of this\r\nsort.\r\n\r\nThe mere interpretation of such classification rules is often\r\ndifficult; especially with reference to the mode of packing. Suppose a\r\ntariff provides a certain rate on stamped metal ware in boxes, barrels\r\nor crates and, furthermore, fixes the charge fifty per cent, higher for\r\nshipment in bales, bags or bundles. If the consignment is encased in\r\ncorrugated straw-board, which of the two rates applies? The difference\r\nin rates being so great, it becomes quite an item on a shipment of\r\nfifteen carloads from Buffalo to the Pacific coast.[332] Or it may be\r\na question as to whether a crate for Colorado cantaloupes is actually\r\nof such dimensions as to come in under a specially favorable commodity\r\nrate.[333]\r\n\r\nThe growing diversification of manufactures and trade is, of course,\r\nresponsible for all three of the developments above indicated. Not only\r\nthe increasing refinement of commerce, but the technical nomenclature\r\nor trade jargon, necessary for the specific and accurate description\r\nof so many thousands of articles, have conspired to render these\r\ndocuments extremely cumbersome in the absence of a general revision and\r\nsimplification. It is but natural that one item after another should\r\nbe added, each bearing a particular name or being classified upon\r\nsome new basis. A striking example of this increase of complexity was\r\nafforded by the cotton goods schedule in the Southern Classification.\r\nBy 1900 there were upwards of thirty different names under which cotton\r\ncloth might be shipped. Great complaint was occasioned, as well as\r\nthe possibility of fraud, by underclassification, etc. Most of these\r\nthirty names did not represent different values of goods, but in\r\nmany instances were merely trade-marks of particular manufacturers.\r\nAt the urgent request of the shippers this complicated schedule was\r\nsuperseded in 1900 by one comprehensive title of \"cotton goods in the\r\npiece\" irrespective of color, particular method of weaving or other\r\nsubordinate details.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of economic theory, the warrant for a\r\ndifferentiation of charges between various classes of commodities\r\noffered for transportation, may be considered primarily from two\r\ndistinct points of view. The first is that of operation, which\r\ndetermines cost. The second is from the standpoint of traffic whereby\r\nthe value of service, so-called, is measured. The reasonableness of\r\nmaking a distinction in freight rates according to the character of\r\ngoods is easily apparent, as judged on the basis of cost of service.\r\nA multitude of factors enter into consideration at this point. The\r\nrailway ought in self-protection to charge more for hauling a thing,\r\nif it actually costs it more in the long run to perform that service.\r\nSome of the factors which enter into this cost were well put by the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission in 1897.[334]\r\n\r\n    \"Whether commodities were crude, rough, or finished; liquid\r\n    or dry; knocked down or set up; loose or in bulk; nested or\r\n    in boxes, or otherwise packed; if vegetables, whether green\r\n    or dry, desiccated or evaporated; the market value and\r\n    shippers' representations as to their character; the cost of\r\n    service, length and direction of haul; the season and manner of\r\n    shipment; the space occupied and weight; whether in carload or\r\n    less-than-carload lots; the volume of annual shipments to be\r\n    calculated on; the sort of car required, whether flat, gondola,\r\n    box, tank, or special; whether ice or heat must be furnished;\r\n    the speed of trains necessary for perishable or otherwise rush\r\n    goods; the risk of handling, either to the goods themselves\r\n    or other property; the weights, actual and estimated; the\r\n    carrier's risk or owner's release from damage or loss.\"\r\n\r\nInstances of approval of classification on the basis of such cost of\r\noperation are frequently found in the decisions of the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission. For example, special service or equipment, as\r\nin the rapid transport of fresh vegetables and fruit from the South,\r\njustify the carriers in a specially high classification.[335] Rates\r\non live hogs by comparison with rates on hog products, as well as on\r\nlive cattle and dressed beef, have likewise been adjusted in terms of\r\ncost of carriage. A classification on hogs yielding a rate equal to\r\ntwo-thirds of that on hog products has been held equitably to represent\r\nthe relative expense.[336] Even the indefinite element of risk has\r\nbeen accepted as justifying a higher classification for live stock as\r\ncompared with other commodities.[337]\r\n\r\nClassification is less easy to defend from the standpoint of the\r\ntraffic manager alone, than from that of the vice-president in charge\r\nof operation. Value of service is at times difficult to understand. It\r\nis not at first sight reasonable, that of two commodities which cost\r\nthe railway exactly the same amount to transport, one should be charged\r\ntwice as much as the other. For example, the rate on anthracite coal\r\nis very much higher than upon soft coal; the rate upon wheat is higher\r\nthan the rate upon some other foodstuffs; the rate upon fine woollen\r\ngoods is very much higher than upon coarse cotton cloth, etc.[338] It\r\nhas been urged frequently that any discrimination in the freight rate\r\non the basis of difference, either in the value of the commodity itself\r\nor in the value of the service rendered, is unreasonable and unjust.\r\nThe case, however, is entirely analogous to that of discrimination\r\nbetween a long and short haul of the same goods. The principle is\r\nperfectly defensible in both cases, and has been accepted in legal\r\ndecisions as well as by economic writers for many years. It is based\r\nupon the fact, which confronts one at every turn in a discussion of\r\nrailway economics, that a large proportion of the expenses of a railway\r\nis independent of the amount of traffic. These fixed expenses must be\r\nmet at all cost if the road is to remain solvent. They constitute a\r\ncharge upon the entire traffic of the line, and are not susceptible\r\nof apportionment to each unit of transportation. Any rate which\r\nwill contribute a surplus, small or large, above the mere cost of\r\ntransportation,--that is to say, above the expenses incident to this\r\nparticular carriage,--and which thereby lessens by the amount of that\r\nexcess the burden of the fixed charges remaining upon other traffic,\r\nis justifiable. But it is defensible only under two conditions. The\r\nfirst is that the goods at any higher rate will go by another route or\r\nnot at all; and the second is that the effect may not be detrimental\r\nto the general course of business,--that is to say, that it is not\r\nopposed to the public welfare. Thus a long haul at a lower rate than\r\nthe rate charged for a shorter haul, if it must be lower in order to\r\nsecure the business, constitutes no injustice to the local shipper;\r\nfor the surplus remaining above the cost of haulage of that particular\r\nincrement of freight lessens thereby the charge which must be made\r\nupon local freight for meeting interest on bonds, maintenance of way,\r\nand equipment expenses, etc., all of which charges, as we have seen,\r\ngo on more or less independently of the traffic. On precisely the same\r\ngrounds a discrimination of freight rates in favor of the cheaper\r\ncommodity or the less valuable service may be defended. Coal or sand\r\nmay reasonably be carried at two and one-fourth mills per ton mile,\r\nwhile the road is coincidently charging three or four times as much\r\nfor hauling dry goods or fine hardware. For if a quarter of a mill\r\nper ton mile can be earned above the expenses incident to hauling\r\nthat sand or coal, it enables the rates on the dry goods or hardware\r\nto be maintained at a lower point than they otherwise would be. It\r\nis unnecessary to elaborate this principle further. It is everywhere\r\naccepted as valid. And it in a measure substantiates Mavor's statement\r\nthat \"freight rates, like rent, are rather the effect of price\r\nmovements than the cause of them.\" When tariffs are high because prices\r\nare high, we are afforded a fair illustration of value of service as an\r\nelement in rate making.\r\n\r\nValue of service, therefore, as affording a warrant for classification,\r\nhas also been recognized in a number of Interstate Commerce decisions\r\nsince 1887. A relation between the grade of the charge and fluctuations\r\nin the market price of the commodity--in other words, charging what the\r\ntraffic will bear--is at times discernible. It is to the interest of\r\nthe public that carriers should be satisfied with relatively smaller\r\nprofits from the transportation of commodities of low price which are\r\nin general demand.[339] Under these circumstances changes in price of\r\nsuch staple commodities as iron and steel or the lower priced grains,\r\nshould be reflected in a corresponding modification of rates.[340]\r\nAkin to this is recognition of a relation in general between the value\r\nof a commodity and its classification. Where, for example, articles\r\nrepresenting different stages of manufacture have to be graded, it\r\nis but fair that the raw material, or the partly-made product should\r\nbe graded lower than the finished article.[341] Similarly, articles\r\nwhich may fairly be substituted for one another ought to be classified\r\nwith reference to their common market value.[342] The relative value\r\nof commodities, as controlling classification, clearly governs the\r\ntreatment of hard and soft coal.[343] The practical difficulty, of\r\ncourse, is to know where to stop in admitting such considerations.\r\nShall \"small-vein\" soft coal, because it cannot compete on even terms\r\nwith the \"big-vein\" product, be accepted for carriage on a more favored\r\nbasis?[344] Some rather nice questions, both of business and public\r\npolicy, would be suggested by such a precedent.\r\n\r\nDifferent classification of the same commodity according to the use\r\nto which it may be put, is evidently an attempt to grade according\r\nto value rather than cost of service. Automobile parts may come in\r\nfrom the wheel-maker at second-class rates, but when they go out to\r\njobbing houses they are rated three times first class.[345] A number\r\nof cases of this sort have come before the Commission. Shall cow peas,\r\nfor example, be classed with corn and oats as agricultural products in\r\none case, while according them a rating with commercial fertilizers in\r\nanother, inasmuch as they may become an active agent in nitrogenizing\r\nsoil?[346] More recently the Commission has declined to recognize the\r\nvalidity of classification on this basis. Thus brick is always to be\r\ncharged the same without regard to whether it is for fire, building\r\nor paving purposes.[347] Unusually low rates for steam coal used by\r\ncarriers and open only to certain shippers for this or other particular\r\npurposes, likewise have been forbidden.[348] The carriers have\r\nattempted to distinguish in grade between dried fruit and raisins. For\r\nthe two industries call for relatively different protection against\r\nold-established competitors.[349]\r\n\r\nAs actually effected in practice, classification of freight seems\r\nto have been largely empirical--the result of long experience in\r\nsympathetically feeling the pulse of the business community. In the\r\nmain, despite their denial of the validity of cost as an element in\r\nrate making, traffic managers and the Interstate Commerce Commission\r\nseem to have been swayed more commonly by this consideration in the\r\nmake-up of schedules. Nevertheless, charging what the traffic will\r\nbear, as a principle, will suffice alone to explain many of the details\r\nof classification now in force. Rates have been adjusted so as to\r\nsecure the largest amount of business possible at the highest rate\r\ncompatible with that volume. In other words, traffic managers have been\r\nmainly influenced by the consideration well stated by a witness before\r\nthe United States Industrial Commission: that, \"a freight tariff is\r\nmade as it is, not because it ought to be that, but because it must\r\nbe that.\" The procedure of classification committees seems, in other\r\nwords, to have been mainly based upon considerations of revenue, and\r\nthat, too, without any very positive evidence as to details.[350]\r\nRule-of-thumb experience, therefore, is mainly represented in\r\nclassifications of the present time; that is to say, an adjustment\r\nof freight rates upon different commodities to suit the commercial\r\nconditions which have happened to prevail at any given time. All of\r\nwhich emphasizes still further the need of scientific revision of these\r\nmost important schedules, preferably by the carriers themselves, but by\r\npublic authority if commercial inertia be too powerful to be overcome.\r\n\r\nThe spread of a classification,--that is to say, the graduation of\r\nrates as between all kinds of goods, from fine silks to lime and sand,\r\nor from aeroplanes, \"set up,\" to pig iron, \"knocked down,\"--is not\r\nconstant. How shall this be theoretically justified? At first sight\r\nit would appear as if the relativity of charges between different\r\nthings, as determined by cost or value of service, ought to remain\r\nfixed; that is to say, for example, that rates on raw hides fairly\r\nstanding at one-half of the charge for shoes, ought to remain always\r\nand everywhere at this ratio. Advocates of a rigid classification\r\nprescribed by public authority seem often to assume that this could be\r\nbrought about. But a moment's consideration of the nature of a tariff\r\nas it has already been described will show that this is impossible. The\r\nspread or gradation, far from being fixed, must in the nature of things\r\never vary from place to place with change of trade conditions. The rate\r\non raw hides relatively to that on shoes in New England--the centre of\r\nmanufacture for footwear--should be very different at Kansas City or\r\nChicago, whence the raw hides are derived: different alone, if for no\r\nother reason than because hides, moving east, progressively add the\r\ncost of carriage the farther they go; while with shoes the augmentation\r\nof value goes on in the opposite direction, geographically. True as\r\nbetween commodities, the same inconstancy of ratio also holds good as\r\nbetween different points along a given line. The rate from New York\r\nto Durham, North Carolina, for example, on first-class freight may\r\nbe fifteen per cent. above that for freight of the second class; the\r\nsecond class maybe twenty per cent. above that of third class for this\r\ndistance, etc.; yet the divergence between these same classes for\r\nanother distance, as between New York and Jacksonville, Florida, may\r\nbe quite different,--twenty per cent. between first and second class,\r\ntwenty-seven per cent. between second and third, and so on. This is\r\nindeed rather a difficult matter to understand.\r\n\r\nThis ever-changing spread of rates from place to place, as between\r\ndifferent commodities and with all possible combinations of the two,\r\nmay be clearly explained by reference to the diagram at page 108,\r\nshowing the gradation of charges by distance for different goods. Is\r\nit not plain that the spread between commodities at any given place is\r\nindicated by taking a vertical cross section of the diagram at that\r\npoint? We have already seen that the curves, rising with increase of\r\nthe distance, do so by different degrees. They cross and recross,\r\nmaking an intricate lace work of lines, because of the fact that\r\nwhile cost, in general, may increase more or less proportionately to\r\ndistance, competition in its ever-varying forms, plays all sorts of\r\npranks with the rates from point to point. The rate at any station is\r\nshown by the height of the curve on the vertical line for that place.\r\nEven, however, if the curves never crossed, but rose by evenly spraying\r\nout from the point of shipment at one end of the line, as in the case\r\nof those for the three upper classes, their relative heights would\r\nconstantly change with distance. But owing to the complexities of\r\ncompetition the onward and upward movement of the curves for particular\r\ncommodities is usually much more erratic than this. Some goods, like\r\nchildren, \"get their growth\" early. They soon attain the level of all\r\nthe charge they can ever bear. Others distribute their development\r\nover a much greater distance. Sometimes, as we have observed, the coal\r\ncurve will be above the wheat curve; sometimes it will be below. In\r\nother words, the vagaries of these sloping lines cause the vertical\r\ncross sections, indicative of spread, to vary from point to point all\r\nalong the line. Such a thing as constancy of ratio between classes\r\nor particular goods is, in the nature of transportation things,\r\nimpossible. This is a matter of fundamental importance, especially\r\nin its bearing upon the proposition, soon to be considered, of\r\nsubstituting a single uniform classification under government authority\r\nfor the present threefold system. Moreover, it demonstrates the great\r\ncommercial disturbance which might ensue from a general advance of\r\nfreight rates by an indiscriminate transfer of commodities from lower\r\nto higher classes, such as was attempted in 1900. Such procedure is\r\naltogether illogical, and economically as upsetting to trade as a\r\ngeneral \"horizontal\" increase or reduction of a customs tariff.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCommodity rates as a means for enabling shippers to reach beyond\r\ntheir immediate territory and gain an entrance to new markets, form\r\nan entirely distinct variety of charges from those quoted in the\r\nclassified tariffs. These are special rates made to suit particular\r\ncontingencies,[351] although, of course, under the law they must be\r\nfiled with the Interstate Commerce Commission in the same manner. Such\r\ncommodity rates, however, do not apply to persons but to localities.\r\nAlthough granted to shippers in a particular place to build up an\r\nindustry, the privilege of shipment under the same conditions is\r\ntheoretically open, of course, to all others at that point. Such\r\ncommodity rates naturally apply to three sets of commercial conditions:\r\nthey either govern large shipments for long distances, as in the\r\ncase of live stock; or, if for short distances, they are confined to\r\ncommodities of the very lowest grade, such as lime, sand or paving\r\nblocks; or else they are introduced to meet special conditions, such as\r\nan irregular market or rapidly fluctuating competitive circumstances,\r\nas in the case of goods for import or export. Such special rates are\r\nalmost invariably granted for carload lots alone. The reason is,\r\nnaturally, that it would not be worth while to make an exception to the\r\nclassified schedules for less than that amount. Moreover, it should\r\nbe observed, special rates of this sort are often introduced in order\r\nto meet changeable competition, such as by steamship lines engaged in\r\nexport or import business. The classified ratings change but little,\r\nand oftentimes remain the same for many years. But in all cases where\r\nfluctuating conditions have to be met, commodity rates by the carload\r\nare likely to appear. This is one reason why the transcontinental\r\ntariffs, exposed to competition either by the Cape Horn or Panama\r\nwater routes, contain so large a proportion of commodity or carload\r\nratings.[352]\r\n\r\nExceptional or commodity rates are also commonly found in a territory\r\nlike the southern states, where manufactures are struggling to maintain\r\na foothold. If it appear that a new industry can maintain itself\r\nin competition with already established industries elsewhere only\r\nby a concession in charges, the traffic manager may elect to grant\r\na commodity rate until such time as the industry has been placed\r\nfirmly upon its feet. The tonnage moving under commodity rates in\r\nsuch circumstances may be much greater than that included under the\r\nclassified schedules. Attention has already been drawn to this fact,\r\nbut it merits still further comment. Probably three-fourths of the\r\nbusiness of American railways is done under such special rates. This\r\nis apparently a higher proportion than rules in foreign countries with\r\nthe possible exception of England. Yet it is important to notice that\r\nthe revenue obtained from such traffic is relatively much less than the\r\ntonnage, inasmuch as most commodity rates are confined to low-grade\r\ngoods. Whether such exceptions to the classified tariffs are on the\r\nincrease or not is open to question. The evidence tends to show that\r\nspecial rates granted in connection with industrial development tend\r\nto increase up to a certain point. Commodity rates, for example, are\r\nsaid to be much more important in the West than they were fifteen\r\nyears ago.[353] But, on the other hand, industrial conditions having\r\nonce become standardized and assured, the natural disposition of the\r\nrailways is to substitute regular schedules for a multiplicity of\r\nspecial rates. The dilemma is that such a special rate once allowed,\r\nis exceedingly difficult to withdraw. An earnest attempt was made by\r\nthe trunk lines in 1899 to retire a large number of these commodity\r\nrates. It then appeared that the New York Central & Hudson River\r\nRailroad had no less than 1,370 on file. Opposition naturally arose to\r\nthe cancellation of these--an opposition less easily overcome because\r\nof the complication that the withdrawal of commodity rates meant\r\npractically the abolition of carload ratings. Such action, therefore,\r\nlooking toward simplification of tariffs, threatened substantially to\r\ndisturb all the existing commercial adjustments. Nevertheless it is\r\nencouraging to note that a distinct reduction in the number of separate\r\nand independent rates put into effect is apparent since the recent\r\nextensions of Federal authority. The following table, covering the\r\ntariffs officially filed at Washington since 1906, is proof positive of\r\ngreat improvement in this regard:\r\n\r\n          FREIGHT SCHEDULES FILED WITH THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE\r\n                               COMMISSION\r\n\r\n  1896                                             131,597\r\n\r\n  1906                                             193,995\r\n  1907                                             187,041\r\n  1908                                             161,584\r\n  1909                                             129,294\r\n  1910                                             109,550\r\n  1911                                              93,821\r\n\r\nA reduction of more than one half within five years is matter for\r\npublic congratulation.[354]\r\n\r\nSpecial or commodity rates for the maintenance of equilibrium between\r\ncompeting markets fall naturally into several distinct groups.[355]\r\nIn the first of these, concerning commodity rates on grain and grain\r\nproducts and cotton, production takes place over a vast extent of\r\nterritory and the products are marketed in places widely remote from\r\none another. The problem under such circumstances is mainly that of\r\nsecuring equalization through different gateways.[356] In the case\r\nof wheat it is a question first of concentration at primary markets,\r\nsuch as St. Paul, Kansas City, or Chicago; and thereafter of carriage\r\nby competitive routes whether by the way of the Gulf, by any of the\r\nvarious Atlantic seaports or by the St. Lawrence River. Commodity\r\nrates are thus determined in this first class of cases mainly with\r\nreferences to competition of routes. On the other hand, when production\r\nis spread over a considerable territory, but when transportation is\r\nthereafter effected along converging lines to a fairly localized centre\r\nof manufacture, the problem of equalizing conditions, competitively,\r\nby the resort to commodity rates, has mainly to do with competitive\r\nconditions at the place of production. Rates on wool to the highly\r\nlocalized markets of the world afford illustration of this second\r\ntype of commodity rate problem.[357] Commodity rates upon fruits and\r\nvegetables to common markets from such widely separated sources of\r\nsupply as Florida and California or the equilibration of conditions of\r\nproduction for coal or lumber from the most widely scattered sources of\r\nsupply, are perhaps the most difficult of all to settle satisfactorily.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe amount of reduction to be allowed on shipments by carload as\r\nagainst consignments in small lots is a nice and most perplexing\r\nproblem in classification. Attention has already been directed to\r\nthe great increase in distinct carload ratings which has accompanied\r\nthe development of trade. As affecting the interests of shippers in\r\ndifferent parts of the country, the question came up almost immediately\r\nafter the passage of the Act to Regulate Commerce. In the so-called\r\nNew York Board of Trade case,[358] complaint was entered by eastern\r\nmerchants against a great increase in the number of wholesale ratings\r\nin 1888. More than five times as many commodities as before were\r\nabruptly given lower rates when shipped out of New York by the\r\ncarload. Inasmuch as a very large proportion of groceries and other\r\nsupplies went by box or package, this reduction accorded on carload\r\nshipments greatly benefited the jobbers all through the West and South.\r\nUnder new conditions provincial middlemen could buy in carloads; and\r\nthen re-distribute from local centres much more advantageously than\r\nbefore. The Commission, called upon to decide as to the relative rights\r\nof these two classes of jobbers, attempted to bring about an adjustment\r\nwhich should, in the main, conform to the existing trade conditions;\r\nand yet should take into consideration the relative cost of service\r\nin the two cases. The competitive struggle between eastern and both\r\nsouthern and western dealers revealed in these early proceedings, has\r\ncropped out continually in official proceedings ever since that time.\r\nIn a modified form the same question came to the front in connection\r\nwith the general advance of freight rates in 1900.[359] The changes at\r\nthis time were twofold--not only modifications in the number of carload\r\nratings, but also an altered differential or spread between the charges\r\nfor the two sorts of shipments. The question is a vital one to all the\r\nshipping interests of the country. It is one of the most troublesome\r\nelements in the establishment of a uniform classification for the\r\nUnited States as a whole. For inability to standardize reasonable\r\ndifferences between carload and small shipments, under the widely\r\ndifferent trade conditions and practices in various sections of the\r\ncountry, is an almost insuperable difficulty in the way of that reform.\r\n\r\nThe economic justice of allowing a carload shipper lower rates than one\r\nwho ships in small lots is apparent, on account of the difference in\r\nthe cost of such service to the railways. This has been recognized by\r\nthe Interstate Commerce Commission and the courts as beyond question.\r\nNot only the amount of paying freight in relation to dead weight; but\r\nthe cost of loading and unloading, of billing or collection and of\r\nadjusting damages--all of these elements of cost are noticeably less\r\nin the case of a full carload. Turning from these considerations of\r\ncost to those prescribed by what may be called traffic principles,\r\nthe difficulty in arriving at a just determination may be easily\r\nappreciated. Glass battery jars in less-than-carload lots were at one\r\ntime charged from New York to Atlanta, Georgia, second-class rates,\r\nnamely ninety-eight cents per one hundred pounds. The same commodity\r\nwhen in carload shipments (not less than 20,000 pounds) was rated as\r\nfifth class; in which case the charge from New York to Atlanta became\r\nsixty cents. Here was a plain difference of thirty-eight cents per one\r\nhundred pounds--upward of sixty per cent. greater charge--to the small\r\nshipper whose business or capital was insufficient to warrant shipments\r\nto such an amount. Two results of such discrimination are possible. In\r\nthe first place, the large shipper is enabled to undersell his smaller\r\ncompetitor and perhaps to drive him out of that class of business. This\r\nmay take place as between two dealers, both located in the South and\r\nbuying their supplies from New York. The second result is that under\r\nsuch rates it is impossible for the manufacturer or northern jobber to\r\nsell direct from New York to the retailer in the South in competition\r\nwith the provincial jobber there located, who ships his goods in at the\r\ncheap carload rate and distributes them thereafter. The problem thus\r\nconcerns at the same time both the small local shipper or dealer, as\r\nagainst a more formidable provincial competitor; and also the remote\r\njobbers as a class against the whole group of local middlemen. In the\r\nlatter case, sometimes, as in the South, the question is still further\r\ncomplicated by a basing point system, under which the provincial jobber\r\nre-distributes to the country stores the goods which have already been\r\nshipped in on a low carload rate.[360] And, locally, there is also the\r\nimmanence in the South of water competition by sea and river to be kept\r\nin mind. Boat charges are based upon space requirements rather than\r\nweight. This introduces further important considerations in fixing the\r\nspread of charges.\r\n\r\nThe problem as it affects the manufacturer is akin to that concerning\r\nthe jobber. Originally, as a matter of fact, the carload reduction was\r\nessentially a manufacturers' rating, especially for goods in which\r\nthe cost of raw material formed a large part of the price of the\r\nfinished product. The relations of the carload rate on the former to\r\nthe less-than-carload rate on the latter, it is obvious, may readily\r\nbecome an important element in industrial success. It is plain enough\r\nthat carload charges under such circumstances should be substantially\r\nless than those upon small consignments; but that is far from affording\r\na satisfactory answer to the question as to the proper spread or\r\ndifference in charge to be allowed between the two.\r\n\r\nObviously, in any representation as to the reasonableness of the\r\ndiscount which shall be allowed on carloads, either on the basis\r\nof cost or of traffic principles, the interests of localities are\r\ncommercially pitted one against another. The New York or Chicago\r\njobbing house desiring to sell its goods directly to the retailers\r\nthroughout the West, wishes to have a relatively low rate on such\r\nsmall shipments as the retailers in lesser places alone can afford to\r\npurchase. Participation in this distributing business, however, is\r\nresented by the middlemen located in western centres--Omaha, Denver,\r\nKansas City, etc.--who all insist that there should be so wide a\r\ndifference between carload and less-than-carload rates that they may\r\nship in their wholesale purchases at a low rate, and thus compete\r\nin their own territory with the manufacturer in the East or the\r\njobber in New York who desires to sell direct.[361] Comparison of the\r\nclassifications in different parts of the country reveals the influence\r\nof these local interests. The railways in Official Classification\r\nterritory desire, of course, to build up the manufacturing and jobbing\r\ncities tributary to them. This can best be done by encouraging the\r\ngrowth of eastern jobbing centres, stimulated by as low rates for\r\nretail as for wholesale shipments. The railways in the western and\r\nsouthern territory, on the contrary, are obliged to consider the claims\r\nof their constituents, and to correspondingly minimize the advantages\r\nwhich foreign competitors of their local wholesale dealers enjoy.\r\nAnother consideration must also be kept in view, namely, that carload\r\nratings can only be accorded when business has developed a magnitude\r\nsufficient to permit shipments of that size. The growth of the volume\r\nof business in general, therefore, might be normally expected to\r\nproduce an increase in the proportion of carload ratings. Experience,\r\nas we have seen, confirms this view. The normal development, then, is\r\ntoward an increase in the number of lower rates quoted for carload\r\nlots. This is retarded only by the influence of the jobbers and\r\nmanufacturers in the eastern trade centres, who insist that they shall\r\nbe permitted to compete on even terms with provincial middlemen by\r\nmaking their shipments direct in small lots at rates approximately\r\nas low as the local jobbers pay on carload lots. This question is an\r\nexceedingly important one, requiring the balance of opposing interests\r\nto a nicety.\r\n\r\nNot unfamiliar aspects of the problem of carload rating are revealed\r\nin a recent case before the Interstate Commerce Commission, concerning\r\nmilk rates in New England.[362] And yet the normal order is reversed.\r\nUsually, complaint is made of the denial of carload ratings. In this\r\ninstance a plea was entered for a useable small unit rate as against\r\nthe wholesale charge. The dispute was precipitated by a deadlock in\r\n1910 between the three large Boston milk contractors and the farmers'\r\nassociations of several states. The producers, failing in their demand\r\nfor an increased price, declined to furnish milk at the old figure.\r\nA famine resulted, which drew the attention of the public sharply\r\nto the system under which the Metropolitan district of Boston was\r\nsupplied. The belief prevailed that the peculiar transportation\r\nconditions known as the \"leased car system\" which had existed for half\r\na century, was mainly responsible for the tight monopoly of the milk\r\nsupply. Under this arrangement specially low charges were allowed to\r\nthose who made shipments regularly by the carload. The Massachusetts\r\nlegislature, after an investigation, finally passed a law providing\r\nthat no carrier should charge more for the transportation of milk by\r\nthe can than was charged for larger quantities; and also that the same\r\nfacilities, icing, for example, should be furnished in the one case\r\nas in the other. This settled the intrastate charges; but it left\r\nmatters as before for all the other New England states contributing\r\nto the market. In this form the controversy was brought before the\r\nFederal authorities, which exhaustively considered the methods of\r\ntransportation as affecting all parties concerned. The contrast with\r\nthe older elastic situation as to milk ratings in New York was sharp in\r\nmany respects.[363] This earlier controversy had to do mainly with the\r\nrelative rights of nearby and distant producers. It was a question of\r\nthe element of distance as affecting a local or territorial monopoly.\r\nThe Boston case, on the other hand, was rather a matter of carload\r\nratings than of graduation of charges according to the length of the\r\nhaul. The monopoly in this instance was that of contractors who had\r\nsucceeded in getting entire control of the business by reason of the\r\nwide spread between charges for milk by the can and by the \"leased\r\ncar.\" Shipments by the can from the independent farmer were rendered\r\npractically impossible since they had to be carried in the baggage car\r\nand were liable to spoil through lack of refrigeration.\r\n\r\nBy contrast with the New York \"open car system,\" the New England plan\r\nfrom the standpoint of cost of service alone seemed to offer several\r\nadvantages. A caretaker, hired by the milk contractor and in constant\r\npersonal touch with the farmers, exercised supervision both over milk\r\nand cans; this insured a heavier loading and more prompt service at\r\nterminals; resulted in the operators providing the best facilities\r\nfor handling the supply; and allowed surplus milk to be directed to\r\nother uses without waste. A large investment had been made under this\r\nsystem, dependent upon its continuance for a reasonable return. On\r\nthe other hand, denial of equally low rates with the same facilities\r\nfor refrigeration to the single-can shipper, had undoubtedly fostered\r\nmonopoly. The railways, conforming to the new Massachusetts law\r\nabove mentioned, offered to furnish and operate a car suitable for\r\nindependent shippers on condition that six hundred cans should be\r\ntendered for shipment. But they denied obligation to furnish icing\r\nfacilities, which latter, of course, were absolutely necessary for\r\nthe success of the competitive service. To be sure, the leased car\r\ncontrolled by the contractors had been theoretically open to all, on\r\ncondition of a small charge for icing; but the farmers contended that\r\nindependent shippers ought not to be compelled thus to deliver over\r\ntheir property into the hands of competitors, with the accompanying\r\nexposure of their business relations. In the light of all these\r\ncomplications the Commission decided that a _per_ can rate with the\r\nnecessary refrigeration, and bearing a proper relation to the carload\r\nrate, ought to be established. And there the matter rests at this time.\r\n\r\nThe problem of mixed carloads, also, is a difficult one to adjust\r\nto the needs of primary and secondary distributing points.[364] It\r\nis oftentimes of vital importance to a small jobber to be able to\r\nmake up a carload of miscellaneous packages. His business may not\r\nbe large enough to permit him to enjoy the advantage of a carload\r\nrate on any single commodity. Or the independent meat packer may be\r\ngreatly benefited by a rule which permits him to bulk his soap and\r\nother by-products with other goods in securing a wholesale rate. Why\r\nmay a paper manufacturer not combine paper bags and wrapping paper\r\nin one territory as well as another? In this regard the rules in the\r\nWest and South are naturally much less liberal than in the East. The\r\nprivilege of mixture has been given only to a limited extent to jobbing\r\nand manufacturing centres by means of commodity tariffs. Such mixture\r\nis usually restricted to analogous articles, such as agricultural\r\nimplements, furniture or commodities intended to serve a joint purpose.\r\nThe recent bitter protest against the discontinuance of the right to\r\nship binder twine with agricultural implements is a case in point. On\r\nthe other hand, eastern railways are a unit in opposing the bulking\r\nof separate shipments in carloads when owned by different shippers.\r\nThe western and southern roads do not specially forbid it. All such\r\ndifferences come to the fore in any attempt to unify the practice of\r\nall the carriers of the country under a single set of regulations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAssuming the reasonableness of a difference in charges between carload\r\nand small shipments, where shall the dividing line as to size be drawn?\r\nThis is the important and perplexing problem of minimum carload rates.\r\nTurning to our excerpt from the Western Classification on page 298,\r\nit appears that 24,000 pounds of advertising matter, N. O. S. (not\r\notherwise specified), must be shipped at one time in order to warrant a\r\ncarload rate. Under such circumstances a consignment of 20,000 pounds\r\nwould be classified first instead of third class--the difference in\r\nrate varying according to distance, but in all cases being substantial.\r\nBetween St. Louis and St. Joseph, Missouri, for example, the charge\r\nwould be sixty instead of thirty-five cents per hundredweight. Were\r\nthe minimum weight for carloads but 15,000 pounds, as in the case of\r\nharvesters under the Southern Classification, this particular shipment\r\nof advertising matter would have enjoyed the full benefit of wholesale\r\ncharges.[365] From this instance it is apparent that the point at\r\nwhich the minimum carload weight falls, is of great importance in\r\nthe determination of the actual rate--an importance also dependent,\r\nof course, upon the spread between carload and less-than-carload\r\ncharges. It is also evident that minimum carload ratings may readily\r\nbe used as a means of advancing charges. If, as appeared in a recent\r\ncase,[366] the minimum carload for wool in sacks was advanced between\r\n1896 and 1912 from 15,000 to 20,000 pounds, the effect upon the shipper\r\nof a consignment of 18,000 pounds, for example, would be as truly\r\nan increase of charges as if the freight rates themselves had been\r\nactually advanced. For under the new schedule, he would be compelled\r\nto pay less-than-carload charges instead of the lower carload rates\r\nformerly granted. Moreover, it is apparent that minimum carload weights\r\nmay enter seriously into commercial competition in a number of ways.\r\nIf 45,000 pounds of raw cotton by a special round-bale process can be\r\nloaded upon a standard car; when but 25,000 pounds of the ordinary\r\nsquare bales could be carried by the same equipment; it is evident\r\nthat tariffs based upon the higher minimum would especially favor\r\none set of competitors as against another.[367] They might, in fact,\r\nbe sufficient to turn the scale entirely in favor of the round-bale\r\nsystem throughout the South. Granted, however, that such heavy loading\r\nmakes for economy in operation, it is clear, nevertheless, that the\r\ncarload minima must be so established as not to discriminate against\r\nthe great bulk of shipments of the more common sort. All along the line\r\none meets with such illustrations of the bearing of the minimum carload\r\nupon rivalry in business. Large shippers are continually striving for\r\na high minimum. The small shippers oppose it for the same reasons. In\r\na similar way the interest of the manufacturer distributing his goods\r\ndirect, in competition with middlemen, is vitally affected.[368]\r\n\r\nCar capacity, both as regards ability to load and carry economically,\r\nis the principal factor in the determination of minimum carload rates.\r\nIt is largely a question of relative cost of operation.[369] Reference\r\nhas already been made to the great economy incident to the use of\r\nlarge cars, whereby the paying load becomes less in proportion to the\r\ndeadweight. This, of course, largely accounts for the steady increase\r\nin carload capacity in recent years. But the question is even more\r\ncomplicated. An adjustment must be made between two main groups of\r\nfreight: first, that which is sufficiently heavy to be readily loaded\r\nto the minimum weight in ordinary cars; and, secondly, light and bulky\r\ngoods of which the common car will contain but a small proportion in\r\nbulk of its truck capacity by weight. Fortunately, we may evade the\r\nmoot point, theoretically, as to whether a carrier is entitled to the\r\nsame revenue from a given vehicle, whether it be loaded with heavy\r\nor light goods; that is to say, whether the rate ought properly to\r\ndecrease per pound with increase in the density of the lading. This is\r\na technical matter as to cost. But it carries certain implications of\r\nconsiderable importance commercially, as will shortly appear.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of conforming carload minima upon light and bulky\r\narticles to those on heavier goods has appeared with each attempt\r\nto standardize equipment. Widely divergent rules in the three main\r\nclassification territories still cause great confusion in this\r\nregard. There is a constant temptation to construct extra long or\r\nwide cars, particularly in the western states, in order to assist\r\nthe manufacturers of such light and bulky products as furniture and\r\nagricultural machinery in their competition with dealers in the\r\nEast, shipping under Official Classification requirements. In other\r\nwords, the penalty carried under the rules as to minimum carloads,\r\nfor the use of cars larger than the standard, has been much less in\r\nthe West than in the East and South. The situation has been further\r\ncomplicated in some instances by the arbitrary action of state railway\r\ncommissions. The experience in this regard is illuminating, as again\r\nshowing the extreme delicacy of adjustment in such matters under the\r\nstress of commercial competition. The short-line distance between the\r\nMissouri and Mississippi rivers lies entirely within the state of\r\nMissouri. It governs, as we have already seen,[370] the entire rate\r\nstructure in this part of the country. This commonwealth some years\r\nago by law fixed a carload minimum of 20,000 pounds for furniture,\r\nagricultural implements and wagons.[371] As it is not practicable to\r\nattain this minimum load on an ordinary standard car, the Missouri\r\nshipper was stimulated to demand larger equipment in order that he\r\nmight avail himself of the lower rate for carload lots. The local\r\nrailways, accordingly, built such cars, which, of course, travelled\r\nfar beyond the limits of this single commonwealth. This forced other\r\nwestern roads, in order to protect their clients in the same markets,\r\nto adopt a similar policy. The result is that extra large equipment is\r\nrelatively more common throughout this territory; thereby conferring\r\na distinct advantage over their eastern competitors upon western\r\nshippers of such light and bulky freight. In pursuance of this same\r\nprotective policy, the western roads have also enforced distinctly\r\nfavorable rules as to carload lots applied to several small cars\r\ninstead of one large one.[372] These troublesome details are given\r\nin the hope that they may show how far the ramification of trade\r\ncompetition extends. They re-enforce the conviction that any reform of\r\nclassification is a matter of extreme difficulty; and, if undertaken\r\nat all, must be done under governmental compulsion and by a single\r\nuniversal reform, rather than by any attempt at piecemeal improvement.\r\n\r\nNext to ability to load and carry, as a determinant factor in fixing\r\nminimum carload weights, the consuming capacity of the market must be\r\nconsidered. A reasonable minimum carload in the East might well be\r\nunfair in the West or South. An old-established factory in New England\r\nmight satisfactorily use a quantity of raw material which in a carload\r\nlot would overwhelm a western or southern plant. Thus it comes about\r\nthat minimum weights on the same goods quite properly vary widely in\r\ndifferent territories; being higher in the East than in the West, and\r\nleast of all in the South. The problem, therefore, of standardizing\r\ncarload rates throughout the country, unfortunately becomes exceedingly\r\ndifficult. A compromise will fail to satisfy anybody; and, moreover,\r\nsuch a change of minimum carload weights at once necessitates a\r\nremodelling of the particular distance tariff to which it applies. This\r\npoint was well illustrated in a recent case.[373] A railway accepted\r\nfor the same carriage at different times two carload shipments of\r\nlime from a given concern. On the one, a rate of thirty-four cents\r\nper one hundred pounds was based upon a minimum carload weight of\r\n24,000 pounds. On the other twenty-nine cents was assessed upon a\r\nminimum of 30,000 pounds. The carrier alleged that these differences\r\nin rates per pound were entirely compatible in view of the difference\r\nin carload minima. It then appeared that these minima, especially\r\nwith a perishable commodity like lime, varied considerably according\r\nto destination. Large distributing centres were given low rates on\r\nhigh minima, while small towns, consuming relatively less, were best\r\nserved by a lower carload minimum to which a higher rate per pound was\r\napplied. In other words, the close interrelation between the rate and\r\nthe minimum was a matter of great commercial importance.\r\n\r\nThe relation of carloads to consuming capacity of the market is an\r\nelement in the trade policy of protection to clients extended by\r\nthe railway. The difficulty of properly relating rates upon raw and\r\nfinished products has already been discussed. Carload minima must\r\nalso be considered in this connection. Why should 50,000 pounds be\r\nprescribed as the carload limit on corn to Texas points, when the\r\nlimit on corn-meal is only 30,000 pounds? Evidently differences in\r\nloading capacity are inadequate as an explanation. Nor can this be\r\naccounted for on the ground of any difference in mere cost of carriage.\r\nThe explanation is purely commercial--springing from the competition\r\nbetween northern mills and mills located in Texas, both making use\r\nof raw material from the same fields. A heavy carload minimum is\r\nentirely practicable on corn for the Texas miller; but an equally heavy\r\ncarload requirement on corn-meal would shut out the northern miller\r\nentirely from many local points. For the market at these small places\r\nis, of course, relatively restricted.[374] There can be no doubt that\r\nevery feature of classification, even down to the last minute details\r\nof carload minima, stands in such intimate relation to commercial\r\ncompetition, that to disturb it in one regard may entail the most\r\nfar-reaching consequences.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEver since 1888 the constantly increasing elaboration of the three main\r\nclassifications in force, with all the resulting inconsistencies and\r\noverlappings, has led to a persistent demand for the introduction of a\r\nsingle uniform classification for the entire country. Soon after the\r\npassage of the original Act to Regulate Commerce in 1887, a resolution\r\npassed the House of Representatives directing the prescription of such\r\na classification. Apparently the Interstate Commerce Commission was\r\nfully alive to the difficulties of such an undertaking. The railways\r\nwere induced to move in the matter, but to no purpose.[375] This first\r\nabortive attempt reflected the mutual jealousies of competing roads,\r\nas well as the difficulties of suiting a single classification to\r\nthe variety of local conditions existing throughout the country. All\r\nthat was done was the recommendation of a \"Board of Uniform Freight\r\nClassification,\" comprising two members from each of the important\r\nterritorial bodies and including both the Mexican and Canadian\r\ncarriers. Changes were to be made by a two-thirds vote. Jurisdiction\r\nover the tripartite division of territory, east, south and west, was\r\nto be assigned to district chairmen. Final authority for the country\r\nat large was to be vested solely in the whole board. The absolute\r\nrefusal of the New York Central & Hudson River to accede to this plan\r\nprevented its acceptance. Apparently too many special or commodity\r\nrates were in force upon its line, in order to hold its powerful\r\nclients in markets all over the country, to make it practicable to\r\nadopt the scheme. Efforts toward uniformity were renewed in 1890,\r\nconfined this time, however, to an attempt to merge the Official and\r\nWestern Classifications. But the same jealous regard of local interests\r\nin each territory, especially with reference to the treatment of\r\ncarload ratings, once more proved an insuperable obstacle. The trunk\r\nlines insisted upon such specially low charges on small shipments\r\nas would enable manufacturers and jobbers in the East to hold their\r\nmarkets in remote districts in competition with rivals in the Middle\r\nWest. The issue raised in the New York Board of Trade case, previously\r\ndiscussed, led to the defeat of this plan.\r\n\r\nA notable revival of interest in uniform classification under\r\ngovernmental authority has taken place since the enactment of the\r\nMann-Elkins amendments to the Interstate Commerce Law in 1910. An\r\nindependent bill in Congress to authorize the enforcement of such a\r\nschedule failed. The railways were stimulated, however, to make a\r\nfurther attempt to solve the difficulty.[376] Protracted sessions\r\nduring 1907-1908 by a conference of five representatives from different\r\nparts of the country, known as the Uniform Classification Committee,\r\nled to many concessions and compromises in favor of harmony. The\r\ncommittee expressed its belief that a uniform classification could\r\nbe drawn up in time; but it emphasized the important point that\r\nall changes in classification must be accompanied by such advances\r\nor reductions in the distance tariffs as to insure the prevailing\r\ncommercial adjustments.\r\n\r\nThe latest advertisement of the difficulties of uniform classification\r\ntook place in connection with the attempted introduction in 1912 of\r\nvarious amendments and reforms proposed by this Uniform Classification\r\nCommittee.[377] Acting in conjunction with the National Association\r\nof Railway Commissioners, an earnest attempt seems to have been made\r\nto eliminate differences between the three great schedules. Few\r\narticles were actually shifted from one class to another, the effort\r\nbeing concentrated upon the establishment of more uniform rules\r\nand descriptions. It was alleged by shippers that more often than\r\notherwise, these changes had brought about an advance rather than a\r\nreduction of charges. It is difficult to decide as to this. But it is\r\nclear that progress in the direction of uniformity is taking place.\r\nFor example, the minimum carload weight for paper, once varying greatly\r\nin different parts of the country, was fixed at an intermediate figure\r\nwhich fairly satisfied conflicting interests. Many opportunities for\r\npersonal discrimination were also eradicated. Grading according to\r\nvalue, for instance, has in the past been a prolific source of abuse.\r\nCandy at less than fifteen cents a pound rated third class, but if\r\nof higher value moving on first-class rates, offered an incentive to\r\nfalse declaration on the part of unscrupulous shippers which was very\r\nproperly eliminated. Abolition of the distinction between finished\r\nstationery and flat paper, put an end to possible underclassification\r\nin the same way. Naturally the carriers in abolishing such fine\r\ndistinctions, grade upward rather than downward. Much objection was\r\nalso made at this time to beneficial modification of the rules for\r\nmixed carload shipments. Binder twine had for years been classified\r\nwith ploughs and harvesters rather than with ropes and cordage. Half\r\na carload of agricultural machinery, therefore, with half a carload\r\nof twine, formerly moving under carload rates, was no longer, as\r\nproposed, to be allowed the privilege of mixing. Similarly, abolition\r\nof the right to bunch wood-working and iron-working machinery\r\nnaturally aroused protest. Such details are here offered, not because\r\nof their intrinsic importance, but as illustrating the opposition on\r\nbehalf of shippers to any movement toward uniformity, even in these\r\nminor details. What the force of this opposition would become, were\r\npropositions advanced for shifting thousands of articles bodily from\r\none class to another, may be readily imagined. The experience thus far\r\nobtained, emphasizes the point that any considerable improvement must\r\nbe carried through, if at all, by direct pressure from governmental\r\nauthority, not upon the carriers alone _but upon the shippers as well_.\r\n\r\nThe degree of complexity at the present day incident to overlapping\r\nand conflicting jurisdiction of the several state and railway\r\nclassification committees and associations, may be best described\r\nby means of a few examples.[378] Traffic originating in Southeastern\r\nFreight Association territory, except Florida, destined to cities in\r\ntrunk line territory is governed by the Southern Classification all\r\nthe way if moving on through rates; if on local rates, the Official\r\nClassification applies north of the Ohio river. From \"Green Line\r\nterritory\"[379] to Pacific coast terminals, the Southern Classification\r\ngoverns to the Mississippi or other gateways; the Western\r\nClassification beyond. But if it originate in Louisiana or Mississippi,\r\nthe Western Classification governs all the way. From most places in\r\nTennessee, Western Classification rules govern all the way, \"subject to\r\ncommodity rates or less-than-carload consignments, classified not lower\r\nthan fourth class.\" To Wisconsin from points throughout the South,\r\nthe Southern Classification governs all the way. But to Minnesota,\r\ngenerally, Southern rules govern to the Ohio river crossing, while\r\nWestern rules apply to the balance of the trip; unless the goods move\r\nthrough trunk line territory by way of the Virginia gateways, in which\r\ncase the Official Classification is effective. These are only a few\r\nsamples chosen from a large collection. Is it any wonder that to the\r\nuninitiated, rate making under such conditions appears to be almost a\r\nsuperhuman task; and is it surprising that to the unscrupulous, such\r\ncomplicated conditions give rise to more or less successful attempts at\r\nevasion of published rates?\r\n\r\nThe present threefold territorial division of the country, for\r\nthe purposes of classification, naturally affords all sorts of\r\npossibilities in the way of veiled discrimination, not merely as\r\nbetween persons but as affecting the interests of different competing\r\nmarkets. Not only is there liability to confusion, but the way is\r\npaved for all sorts of favoritism. Wherever shipment is made from one\r\nclassification territory to another, it is always possible to adjust\r\nthe rates with a view to local advantage. For instance, one of the\r\nprincipal causes of complaint in the South is the advantage which\r\nNashville, Tennessee, enjoys through having all of its rates from\r\neastern and northern centres made upon the Official Classification.\r\nInasmuch as the rates under the Southern Classification are\r\nconsiderably higher, this operates to place other competing cities in\r\nthe South under a distinct disability in competition with Nashville. It\r\nis possible, therefore, for the Louisville & Nashville by this means to\r\nbuild up one community at the expense of another. The same device gives\r\nRichmond, Norfolk and the other Virginian cities a great advantage\r\nover their competitors.[380] Again, rates from New York to Memphis and\r\nNew Orleans are made upon the Official Classification, by whatever\r\nroute; while to intermediate points, such as Vicksburg, Natchez,\r\nand Baton Rouge, they go on the rates prescribed by the Southern\r\nClassification, which are considerably higher. From New York to St.\r\nPaul through Chicago, shipments are made on the low rate basis of the\r\nOfficial Classification; while from Chicago to St. Paul they go under\r\nthe Western Classification. From Birmingham, Alabama, to St. Paul,\r\nthe rates as far as Chicago are based upon the Southern schedule, and\r\nfrom thence on under the Western. From San Francisco to St. Paul, the\r\nWestern Classification prevails, unless the freight is carried under\r\nthe commodity rates of the Transcontinental schedule. The peculiar\r\nsituation of Nashville on shipments from the Northeast has already\r\nbeen stated. This immediately complicates the rates from so-called\r\nCook County Junctions--that is to say, from Chicago territory. All\r\nconsignments for the entire distance are governed by the Southern\r\nClassification. This, in face of the low Official Classification\r\nrates from trunk line territory, operates as a discrimination against\r\nChicago. Even more complicated still are the combinations by which\r\nrates are made from local points in the North into the Far Southwest.\r\nAnd still farther complexity results from the existence, as already\r\nmentioned, in several parts of the country, such as Iowa, Illinois,\r\nGeorgia, etc., of state classifications, prescribed by the railway\r\ncommissions. These, to be sure, are intended for application only\r\nto local rates. But by this means, the jobbing interests of the\r\nlocalities are protected, without at the same time giving consideration\r\nto an equitable adjustment as between all the remoter interests\r\nconcerned.[381] One of the primary advantages, therefore, from the\r\nunification of the three systems now existing, would be the possibility\r\nof readjusting not only definitely, but also equitably, the conflicting\r\ninterests of various shippers and communities now tied up by these\r\nlocal arrangements.\r\n\r\nA recent case[382] illustrates the bearing of classification rules upon\r\ncompetition in trade as between rival cities. Chicago and most of the\r\nOhio river gateways enjoy a so-called \"two-for-one-rule,\" permitting\r\nthe application of carload rates on part carloads in excess of full car\r\nladings. The complaint alleged that the denial of this privilege to\r\nIndianapolis, whereby less-than-carload rates were charged on excess\r\nfractional carloads, unjustly discriminated against this city in the\r\ntransportation of various light and bulky articles, such as vehicles\r\nand furniture, in competition for trade throughout the Southwest.\r\nThe difficulty arose from a conflict between rules in the Western\r\nClassification and the Southwestern Tariff Committee, the latter being\r\na subordinate body having jurisdiction over local practices in Texas\r\nand the neighborhood. The rule in one case provided that where a car of\r\nsufficient capacity to accommodate light and bulky shipments could not\r\nbe promptly furnished, two smaller cars would be provided, subject to\r\nwholesale rates, however the consignment was divided between the two\r\ncars. The Commission declined to interfere in this case, anticipating\r\nthe necessity for a thoroughgoing revision of all such rules which,\r\nit is obvious, almost invite manipulation of rates and improper\r\ndiscrimination.\r\n\r\nEven a cursory examination of the classification a few years ago would\r\nbring to light all sorts of petty anomalies and inexplicable conflicts\r\nboth of description and rates. Most of these doubtless had some warrant\r\noriginally, but it seems, indeed, as if many differences might be\r\neliminated.[383] For instance, \"excelsior spring beds K. D. (knocked\r\ndown), sawdust, and leather belting, are all in the second class of\r\nthe Official Classification, when shipped in less-than-carload lots.\r\nIn the Western, only the belting and beds are in the second class,\r\nexcelsior is third and sawdust fourth; while in the Southern, beds are\r\nfirst class, belting second class, excelsior fifth class, and sawdust\r\nsixth.\" The recent complaint of the Greater Des Moines Committee[384]\r\ndisclosed an odd state of affairs under which old shoes were given a\r\ncarload rating to Des Moines--an advantage not extended to new and\r\nunused footwear. Why should axes be given carload rating in trunk\r\nline territory when the freight rate on hatchets is the same whether\r\nthe shipments are in 100 pound or 20,000 pound lots? Is it logical\r\nthat cotton piece goods from Atlanta to Boston should be differently\r\nclassified from the same commodity exchanged between the same two\r\ncities in the opposite direction; or that goods should enter Richmond,\r\nVirginia, on one classification and go out on another? Such anomalies\r\nare sometimes difficult to account for. Their existence, however,\r\ndespite the efforts of the carriers to eliminate them and to keep them\r\neliminated, emphasizes strongly the need for such continual revision\r\nas shall more generally standardize practice. Few carriers alone are\r\nable to withstand pressure from powerful shippers. It is difficult, in\r\nfact, even for the classification committees to oppose them. The strong\r\nhand of the government should enforce harmonious action to the fullest\r\ndegree compatible with the growth of trade and conflicting commercial\r\ninterests. It would help the railways even more than the shippers.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, bearing in mind all the disadvantages and evils of the\r\npresent threefold system, the obstacles incident to the substitution\r\nof a single uniform classification for the United States grow more\r\nimpressive as one examines them in detail. Our vast territory and the\r\nextreme diversity of agricultural and industrial conditions render the\r\nproblem far more difficult than in the compact and more homogeneous\r\ncommunities abroad. The primary advantage of the present system is\r\nthat each of the three existing classifications more or less clearly\r\nreflects local trade conditions in its own territory. From the point of\r\nview of transportation, the same commodity may well be able to yield\r\nwidely different proportions of the total revenue levied upon the\r\ntraffic of that section. For example, cotton piece goods may be rated\r\nfirst class in Western territory, fourth class in Southern, second\r\nclass less fifteen per cent. in Official territory, and one-third\r\nof first class in the transcontinental tariffs. The reason for this\r\ndiversity of treatment is that such cotton piece goods both in the\r\nSouth and the East are a staple product of the district. The rates,\r\ntherefore, in each case are intended to foster the manufacture of\r\ncotton by according a relatively low freight rate upon its output. In\r\nthe West, on the other hand, where no cotton is raised and no cotton\r\nmills exist, these goods become much more valuable, as classified,\r\nrelative to other commodities. Oranges or lemons in southern California\r\nare favored by almost commodity rates in order to foster the industry\r\nin that locality. But these citrus fruits reaching New England as a\r\nluxury, may consequently there be made to contribute a much larger\r\nproportion of the railways' revenue. The East, as a rule, classifies\r\nmanufactured products relatively low, inasmuch as it is the home\r\nterritory for industry of this sort. But these products, when they pass\r\nbeyond the Mississippi, rise almost automatically to a higher class as\r\nthey increase in value to the community in which they are consumed.\r\nHow different are the commercial conditions under which wool is rated\r\neast and west! In one territory it is distributed to manufacturers in\r\nsmall lots at way stations; in the other it moves long distances in\r\nsolid carload lots.\r\n\r\nOne further illustration may make our point clear. At first sight it\r\nis anomalous that in the East the rates on cattle and shoes between\r\nNew York and Boston are not widely different, namely nineteen cents\r\nand twenty-five cents, respectively, per one hundred pounds; while as\r\nbetween Montana and Chicago, the rate on shoes west bound is almost\r\nfour times as great as the rate on cattle over the same haul eastward.\r\nIn other words, rates on shoes in the East are at bed-rock, whereas in\r\nthe West it is the cattle rates which are held at the lowest possible\r\npoint. Ton-mile rates on shoes, in other words, increase progressively\r\ntoward the west, while ton-mile rates on cattle rise, contrariwise, in\r\nthe direction of the stronghold of manufactures. The difference between\r\nthe two, however, is in the fact that the upper level of what the\r\ntraffic will bear is very much greater in the case of one than of the\r\nother. Cattle, possibly, may never support more than seventy-five cents\r\nper hundredweight; while shoes can be moved under rates four times as\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\nObviously any mere compromise between divergent classifications, each\r\nbased upon the protection of a local constituency against competition\r\nfrom outside its own territory, can hardly prove satisfactory. Cotton\r\npiece goods, already instanced in this regard, if grouped as first\r\nclass in the West, second class less fifteen per cent. in the East,\r\nand fourth class in the South, would hardly be adequately treated\r\nin a uniform classification for the entire country by averaging\r\nthese different figures. For neither the West nor the South would be\r\nsatisfied--the rating being too high to fully protect the southern\r\nmills against competitors in New England; nor, on the other hand,\r\nwould the classification be sufficiently high in the West to yield\r\nthe roads proportionately the revenue which goods of that character\r\nought properly to contribute. The East, alone, lying intermediate\r\nbetween the other two, would not be greatly disturbed. The necessary\r\noutcome, it is predicted, of the adoption of any such average or\r\nuniform classification would be the quotation of exceptional commodity\r\nrates wherever the uniform classification was at variance with local\r\ninterests. The increase in commodity ratings after 1887--now happily\r\nreversed--may perhaps be in part accounted for in this way. Any such\r\nstimulation of exceptional ratings would be a primary objection to\r\nany uniform classification for the United States as a whole. As one\r\nwitness before the Interstate Commerce Commission testified, \"If ever\r\nthere is a uniform classification, it will take a warehouse to hold\r\nthe commodity tariffs.\" Were such the case, far greater complexity and\r\npossible discrimination might exist than at the present time.\r\n\r\nA second equally important disadvantage of the prescription of\r\na uniform classification arises from the fact, already noted,\r\nthat classifications and distance tariffs are interlocking and\r\ninterdependent. Any change of the one involves a change of the other.\r\nTherefore, a unification of the three existing classifications would\r\nrender it necessary to overhaul from top to bottom the distance tariffs\r\nunder which it was to be applied all over the country. For example,\r\nthe rate from New York to Atlanta, first class, being $1.14, while the\r\nrate from New York to Chicago, about the same distance, first class,\r\nwas 75 cents; to choose a first-class rating which should apply on\r\nboth these lines would involve, not only a re-classification of the\r\ncommodities, but also that the new rates applying upon first-class\r\ngoods should be somewhere between $1.14 and 75 cents. Inasmuch as it\r\nhad taken many years to reach the present adjustment, it seems hardly\r\npossible that a new arrangement could be made which would yield the\r\nrailways a satisfactory return upon their traffic. The difficulty\r\nherein suggested was clearly instanced in the case of a comparison made\r\nbetween the Southern Classification and the Uniform Classification\r\nproposed in 1890. The difficulty, and always a prominent one, was that\r\nthe Uniform Classification was largely for carload lots, while the\r\npractice was entirely different in the old Southern Classification.\r\nMoreover, most of the Southern rates were given for goods \"released\";\r\nthat is to say, at the owner's risk. Cotton piece goods, non-released,\r\nin less-than-carload lots from New York to Atlanta, were charged\r\nsixty cents a hundredweight under the old Southern Classification. As\r\nreclassified in the suggested Uniform Classification, the rate was\r\nninety-eight cents; and was given only for \"released,\" that is to say,\r\nat owner's risk. The difference for the same commodity from Louisville\r\nto Atlanta was as fifty-six cents in the old Southern, to ninety-two\r\ncents under the Uniform. Canned goods, not otherwise specified,\r\n\"non-released,\" in less-than-carload lots from Louisville to Atlanta,\r\nwere charged sixty-eight cents under the old Southern Classification.\r\nThe new Uniform Classification, in order to yield the same revenue,\r\nmade it necessary to charge a rate of eighty-one cents. Differences of\r\nthis kind were manifest in every one of the thousands of commodities.\r\nIn other words, the adoption of a uniform classification meant to\r\nabolish by a stroke of the pen all the old rates which formerly\r\nexisted. An entirely new schedule of rates would have had to be worked\r\nout; with the most uncertain results upon revenue and upon the rival\r\ncommercial interests concerned. The magnitude of such a task can be\r\nscarcely appreciated. Years would be required to reach a condition of\r\nrelative stability once more.\r\n\r\nThe close interdependence of classification and distance tariffs, as\r\nwell as, incidentally, the differing spread of rates between various\r\ngroups of goods under the three existing classification systems, are so\r\nfundamental in their bearing on reform that yet another illustration\r\nmay not be out of place. It is given in the following table. This shows\r\nthe rates from St. Louis--standing at the meeting point of the main\r\nclassification territories--for approximately equal distances out in\r\nthree different directions.\r\n\r\n         Rates                  Cents per 100 lbs.\r\n\r\n  Southern Classification--\r\n    St. Louis to Nashville   1   2   3   4   5   6   A   B\r\n                            ------------------------------\r\n        (323 miles)         61  52  45  35  28  23  22  26\r\n\r\n  Official Classification--\r\n    St. Louis to Louisville  1   2   3   4   5   6\r\n                            ----------------------\r\n        (317 miles)         41  34½ 25½ 17½ 15  12\r\n\r\n  Western Classification--\r\n    St. Louis to St. Joseph  1   2   3   4   5   A   B   C   D   E\r\n                            --------------------------------------\r\n        (320 miles)         60  45  35  27  22  24½ 19½ 17  13½ 11\r\n\r\n  Illinois Classification--\r\n    St. Louis to Chicago     1    2    3    4  5    6    7    8    9   10\r\n                            ----------------------------------------------\r\n        (284 miles)         43.3 35.2 27.5 22 17.6 16.6 15.1 13.5 10.7 9.6\r\n\r\nOne line penetrates Southern territory 323 miles to Nashville; another\r\ngoes eastward 317 miles to Louisville under Official ratings; and\r\nthe third extends westward 320 miles to St. Joseph, according to the\r\nschedules of the Western Classification. To these three there is also\r\nadded a set of rates north bound under the Illinois Classification\r\nwhich applies between St. Louis and Chicago, 284 miles. This last\r\nschedule, of course, is prescribed by the state railway commission.\r\nThe first point to notice is the widely different number of groups\r\nin the four schedules. One is divided into eight classes; another\r\ninto six; while the last two are each spread over ten subdivisions.\r\nSecondly, bearing in mind that the three upper schedules govern\r\napproximately the same mileage, it will be noted that the Official\r\nrate, first class, is only about two-thirds of that in the other\r\ntwo classes. If one then compares the sixth group in each case, an\r\neven greater divergence appears--the Official rate being only about\r\none-half of that in the other two cases. Or, taking the lowest rates\r\nof all in the three upper schemes--always, be it noted, for equal\r\nmileages--it now appears that the Official and the Western descend\r\nto about the same figure, while the Southern is arrested at a point\r\nmore than twice as high. The primary significance of this showing\r\nis, of course, that a single uniform classification in which all of\r\nthese three systems should be merged, means not merely a reassignment\r\nof all possible commodities in a given number of classes; but also a\r\ncomplete recasting of the distance tariffs as well. In other words, as\r\naforesaid, freight rates being compounded of the two factors, distance\r\ncharge and classification, all the delicate adjustments based upon\r\ncommercial competition throughout the country, would be thrown into\r\nutter confusion; unless every modification of the grouping of classes\r\nwere accompanied by a corresponding change in the rates per mile. A\r\ntask sufficient indeed to appall the best of traffic experts!\r\n\r\nTo complete the demonstration of the complexity of present\r\narrangements, and yet of the danger incident to rudely disturbing them,\r\none should apply the classified rates in the preceding paragraph for\r\nthese equal hauls to particular commodities. Take household goods in\r\ncarloads, for example:--\r\n\r\n                                        Cents          Per Cent. of\r\n                                      per 100 lbs.   first-class rate.\r\n\r\n  St. Louis to Nashville                 23                38\r\n  St. Louis to Louisville                34.5              83\r\n  St. Louis to St. Joseph                19.5              33\r\n  St. Louis to Chicago                   15.1              35\r\n\r\nExamination of the classification volumes thus assigns these the\r\nfollowing rates in the three directions for equal distances out of\r\nSt. Louis. Going east the charge would be 34.5 cents, going west\r\n19.5 cents, and going south 23 cents per 100 pounds, respectively.\r\nThe hodgepodge is made more manifest by the right hand column in\r\nthis table, in which the percentage of first-class rates levied upon\r\nhousehold goods in carloads under the four classifications is shown.\r\nUnder the Official system, with the lowest first-class rates, as\r\nabove noted, the rate on household goods is higher than under any of\r\nthe other three. The result is that the relation between the rate\r\non household goods and first-class goods is eighty-three per cent.;\r\nwhereas in the other two cases it is substantially less than half this\r\npercentage. This single illustration, it is hoped, may drive home the\r\nconclusion that there is an immense mass of fortuitous and utterly\r\nunreasonable allocation under the classification systems as they are at\r\npresent established.[385] But whether that may be used as an argument\r\nin favor of substituting a single uniform classification is open to\r\nserious doubt. Rather does it serve to emphasize the fact that rigid\r\nrevision of the present scheme under Federal control, perhaps, is more\r\nnecessary than an experiment in uprooting the entire system.\r\n\r\nA few general conclusions may be drawn from this rather over-elaborate\r\ndescription of present conditions as to classification in the United\r\nStates. It has been necessary, however, to reiterate details in order\r\nto make clear the extremely unsatisfactory situation at the present\r\ntime. In fact, in this domain of classification, standardization of\r\npractice so characteristic of American rate making and operation in\r\ngeneral, has noticeably lagged behind. Whether it will be possible,\r\nin view of the wide extent of the country and the diversity of its\r\nclimatic and commercial conditions, ever to devise a single uniform\r\nclassification is open to serious doubt. Even the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission, once a leader in the demand for uniformity, now concedes\r\nthis fact in particular instances.[386] Thus:--\"wool east of the\r\nMississippi is taken up at numerous points and is carried under\r\ncomparatively light loading. What would be a fair classification\r\nthere, would not be just in the Far West, where the movement is almost\r\nentirely in carloads and where the actual loading is from two to three\r\ntimes that in Official Classification territory. We are of the opinion\r\nthat wool should be classified under the Western Classification as\r\nsecond class, l. c. l., and fourth class, c. l.,\" etc. The experience\r\nof England is, of course, commonly cited as a precedent.[387] In that\r\nlittle country the ever-increasing complexity of classification was\r\nprecisely parallel to our own. From simple schedules for a few hundred\r\narticles, the number of items steadily increased until there were over\r\n4,000. At this point the government intervened; and after tedious and\r\nprotracted sessions under the auspices of the Board of Trade in 1888\r\nthe whole schedule was brought down to 1,400 separate items. All the\r\ncomplicated and confusing rules were harmonized and many anomalies were\r\ncut out. Certain it is that matters should be firmly taken in hand in\r\nthis country in the same manner. The separate state classifications and\r\nhundreds of conflicting rules and jurisdictions should be eradicated.\r\nEven if a single uniform classification be proved impracticable, as\r\nseems to me likely, it might still be possible to greatly simplify\r\nthe present intolerable mix-up. There should be a representative of\r\nthe Interstate Commerce Commission on each of the classification\r\ncommittees, ready at all times to exert pressure for simplification and\r\nuniformity.[388] The three main classification committees, supposing\r\nthat they shall continue to exist, should interlock by exchange of\r\nrepresentatives. The greater the reform flowing from the initiative\r\nof the carriers themselves, the better. Thus, in time, matters may\r\nbecome sufficiently standardized as between the three main committees\r\nso that, under legal compulsion or otherwise, the final problem of\r\nuniformity may be tackled by recasting the whole body of tariffs and\r\nclassifications together. But such a task at this writing appears\r\nalmost superhuman. Conditions may, of course, so shape themselves\r\nultimately that it may be brought about. But, in the meantime, steady\r\nand persistent pressure should be exercised in the direction of this\r\nfinal goal. Reform of classification practice is certainly the greatest\r\nneed of the time in the transportation field.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[315] 1901. Ripley, W.

The\r\ndanger of arbitrary administrative interference without a full\r\nunderstanding of the intricacies of rate making, and at the same\r\ntime the essential soundness of American railway practice in seeking\r\nindependently to solve these complex problems by equitable means, are\r\namply illustrated. The fallacy of certain objections to governmental\r\ncontrol, on the other hand, is revealed with corresponding clearness.\r\nThree principles in particular deserve mention in this connection.\r\nThese are: (1) that the element of distance should be a prime factor\r\nin the final adjustment of rates as between competing localities;[389]\r\n(2) that coöperation and agreement between competing carriers are\r\nessential to any comprehensively fair system; and (3) that permanency\r\nand stability of rates are of equal importance with elasticity. That\r\nall three of these results have been voluntarily worked out in practice\r\nby the trunk lines is a tribute at once to the ability and fairness of\r\ntheir traffic officials. Standards are thus established toward which\r\nthe carriers in the West and South should strive, as soon as their\r\nlocal traffic conditions will permit, in an endeavor to promote good\r\nrelations with the shipping and consuming public.\r\n\r\nThat distance tariffs, modified in part to suit commercial conditions,\r\nare not only theoretically sound, but entirely practicable, this study\r\naims to prove. The bogey of German rate schedules vanishes into thin\r\nair when it appears that the greatest railway companies in the United\r\nStates have for years adopted the same principles in working out their\r\ntariffs. The long and short haul rule is here enforced, not alone as\r\nbetween various points on the _same_ line, but also as between points\r\nequally distant from a common destination on _different_ roads. Thirty\r\nyears ago the trunk lines conceded the principle, for the recognition\r\nof which the shippers of the West and South are now so vociferously\r\nclamoring before Congress and the Federal courts.\r\n\r\nThis desirable end could never have been attained if the several\r\ncompeting companies had not been able to act in coöperation. The\r\nerroneous popular opinion that railway competition must be preserved\r\nin the public interest, had it been legally enforced in this territory\r\na generation ago, would have prevented absolutely any comprehensive\r\nsolution of the problem. Until Congress abandons this theory, and\r\ntreats railways as essentially monopolistic, thereafter to be protected\r\nand maintained as _beneficent_ monopolies through adequate governmental\r\nsupervision, the lesson of trunk line experience will not have been\r\nlearned. And, finally, the interesting fact that for almost thirty\r\nyears it has not been necessary to change either the main system or, in\r\nmany instances, the actual rates charged thereunder, is an offset to\r\nthe contention that success in railway operation is to be judged by the\r\ninstability of rates, seeking to follow constantly the ups and downs of\r\ncommercial conditions. Certain modifications, especially in export and\r\nimport traffic, or wherever water rates have to be made or met, are, of\r\ncourse, inevitable. But it is absurd to reason from this that railway\r\ntariffs in the main need to be continually jostled about at the behest\r\nof the shipping public. Of course, if one railway changes its rates,\r\nall the rest must follow. That is the principal reason why many of our\r\nrate schedules have been as uncertain as the weather. But there is no\r\nreason why, if all parties in competition keep good faith and observe\r\ntheir tariffs, a schedule of class rates for domestic shipments should\r\nnot remain practically constant.\r\n\r\nTake the rates on raw cotton from Mississippi river points like\r\nMemphis to New England cities, for example. Was any staple product\r\never subject to greater fluctuations in price than raw cotton, varying\r\nas it has in the last few years, from five to fifteen cents a pound?\r\nYet through it all, good years and bad, whether for the planter or the\r\nmanufacturer, the freight rate has stood unchanged at fifty-five cents\r\nper hundredweight. In the same way, within the limits hereafter to be\r\ndescribed, the trunk line rate system has endured for a generation.\r\nFounded upon sound and, consequently, defensible principles, it has\r\npromoted good feeling between railway and shipper. And, if the changes\r\nof classification since 1900 had not been made, one may reasonably\r\ndoubt whether the demand for Federal legislation would have been any\r\nmore insistent throughout the eastern central states than it now is in\r\nNew England.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe causes leading to the adoption of a systematic rate scheme by the\r\ntrunk lines acting jointly[390] can be understood only in the light of\r\nthe conditions existing about 1875. The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad had\r\nentered Chicago in 1874, after which time the most furious rate wars\r\nbetween the four trunk lines had been in progress. The main dependence\r\nof all these lines was still upon the grain traffic, and all of this\r\nwas moving in one direction toward the seaboard. As late as 1882,\r\nseventy-three per cent. of the trunk line tonnage east bound consisted\r\nof such commodities.[391] Moreover,--and this is a point of especial\r\nimportance,--the bulk of this grain originated in the territory east\r\nof the Mississippi and south of Chicago. Over four-fifths of the\r\neastbound traffic came from the states of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio,\r\nMichigan, and Pennsylvania. The great northwest and trans-Mississippi\r\nterritory was not yet opened up. Wisconsin and Iowa contributed only\r\nabout ten per cent. of the eastbound tonnage, while over two-thirds of\r\nthe westbound business did not pass beyond Illinois.[392] Nor was the\r\ntraffic concentrated as yet in the larger cities. Mr. Fink makes it\r\nclear that most of the business was gathered up by the trunk lines and\r\ntheir connections from small towns along the way. The modern problem of\r\nthe great city in competition with the small towns was as yet unknown.\r\n\r\nThe trunk lines had few feeders. Only the main stems to Chicago had\r\nbeen built. Consequently these central states were served by a host of\r\nlittle cross lines, built as local enterprises, many of them radiating\r\nfrom Chicago, Cincinnati, Toledo, or Cleveland at right angles with\r\nthe trunk lines, and, for the main part, engaged in an endeavor to\r\nopen up their territories to water communication with the East by way\r\nof the lakes and the Erie Canal. Rail rates, nominally at least, were\r\nstill high, the rate first-class Chicago to New York, for example,\r\nbeing about double its present figure; and the conditions of railway\r\noperation were such that water competition was a matter for grave\r\nconcern. Every change in the lake situation was at once reflected in\r\nthe rail rates, violent dislocations at the opening and closing of\r\nnavigation in the spring and fall being of especial importance.\r\n\r\nAmong these confusing elements in the problem of trunk line rate\r\nadjustment five distinct phases were prominent. In the first place the\r\nfour trunk lines were a unit in opposition to the diversion of traffic\r\nto the Great Lakes and the Erie Canal. However much they might bicker\r\nwith one another afterward,--apportionment of the rail business being\r\na distinct feature of the problem,--their interests at the outset were\r\nidentical respecting the necessity of holding the business on land.\r\nWater competition by way of the lakes or the Ohio river was a danger\r\ncommon to them all. The intensity of this pressure may be understood\r\nfrom the statement that the trunk lines were not even consulted in\r\nmaking the Chicago-New York rate on which the western lines pro-rated.\r\nThey had no voice in it, merely accepting the figure offered them by\r\ntheir connections into Chicago.[393] The second feature of the problem,\r\nnamely, the division of the all-rail traffic among the competing\r\ncarriers, is immaterial to the main question before us. Thirdly, it was\r\nessential to the trunk lines to restrict and control the activities of\r\nthe subsidiary cross lines and feeders, most of which, as has been\r\nsaid, were independent. Many of these, aside from having a direct\r\ninterest in their longest haul to a terminus on the lakes or the Ohio\r\nriver, had been built by local capital, and were administered in the\r\ninterests of the lake cities or Cincinnati and Louisville. There was\r\nno unity whatever in their policies, and the most ridiculous wastes of\r\ntransportation resulted. Grain was literally meandering toward the East\r\ninstead of moving by a direct route.[394] Joint through rates would be\r\nmade by the most extraordinary chain of connecting links leading to the\r\nseaboard by very circuitous ways.[395]\r\n\r\nA fourth evil, akin to this, consisted of the difficulty of maintaining\r\nthrough rates, not as among the trunk lines who might be made parties\r\nto a pool, but by reason of cut-throat competition between their\r\nwestern connections.[396] The agents of these western lines would\r\nindiscriminately cut rates to or from points on their lines, and then\r\nexpect their trunk line connections to accept a proportionate shrinkage\r\nof the joint through rate for their part of the haul. The weaker\r\ncompanies would, of course, be susceptible to such temptations in order\r\nto secure the business. No stable apportionment of this western traffic\r\namong the eastern lines would be possible until they could agree upon\r\na fair rate for the trunk line haul, and rigidly adhere to it. And,\r\nfinally, water competition, causing constant fluctuations in the lake\r\nand Ohio river rates, while directly potent only at waterway points,\r\nwas continually putting the through rates from these points out of line\r\nwith the local rates from non-competitive inland centres. Or, perhaps,\r\nthe Ohio river and lake rates would be out of joint with one another.\r\nThe Chicago basis, if applied to Paducah, would make a rate on tobacco\r\nthat would send it _via_ New Orleans.[397]\r\n\r\nProducts would go down the Mississippi after the lakes had been closed\r\nby ice. A considerable amount of corn was certainly moved to New York\r\nby that route.[398] Some device for coordination of the through and\r\nlocal rates--or, as one might put it, for the distribution of the\r\nlocalized shock of water rate changes--was imperatively necessary.\r\n\r\nAn ingenious rate clerk named MacGraham, in the offices of the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad, proposed a comprehensive scheme for meeting\r\nthese difficulties which was first used for westbound rates on\r\nDecember, 15, 1871. The Chicago-New York rate was to constitute a\r\nbasis, upon which all other rates were to be made in percentages,\r\naccording to their relative distance from New York.[399] Thus, assuming\r\nChicago to be 900 odd miles from New York, the rate from a point 600\r\nmiles inland would be about sixty-six and two-thirds per cent. of the\r\nChicago rate, whatever that might be. Whenever the lake rate at Chicago\r\nchanged, every other rate throughout trunk line territory would vary\r\nin due proportion. Relativity of charges would thus be preserved.\r\nMoreover, the shortest route, \"worked or workable,\" was to be used\r\nin calculating the rates, the basic distance being about 920 miles\r\nby the Lake Shore from Chicago to Dunkirk, Ohio, and thence by the\r\nErie to New York. This would give compelling effect to distance as a\r\nfactor, and would tend to penalize the roundabout carriage of goods.\r\nMore than this, however, it would render the inland territory directly\r\ntributary to New York. From a point, for example, fifty or one hundred\r\nmiles south of Chicago, Toledo, or Cleveland, the local rate into\r\nthose towns plus the through rate east to New York would always exceed\r\nthe rate by a direct route east. For the hypothenuse of a triangle is\r\nclearly always shorter than the sum of the other sides. All shipping\r\npoints equidistant from New York would enjoy equal rates, those rates\r\nat any time being determined by the state of water competition. This\r\nwas a manifest advantage to the small inland centres, while the rate\r\non the lake front was not affected. The trunk lines lost something,\r\nperhaps, through lower rates at intermediate points; but the gain\r\nthrough diversion of traffic from the lake to the rail lines more\r\nthan compensated. For conditions were such in the summer of 1875 that\r\nthe lake boats were prepared to carry grain for almost nothing. The\r\nrailroads were helpless in such cases.[400] The only real sufferers\r\nwere the short, independent cross lines and the lake and river cities.\r\nOf these, the former were reduced to a status of mere feeders or\r\nbranches of the trunk lines. They were compelled to accede to the\r\nplan, however, by threatened refusal of the trunk lines to turn over\r\nbusiness to them westbound, unless they reciprocated with their grain\r\nshipments eastbound.[401] Many of these lines became bankrupt later,\r\nand were absorbed by the larger companies.[402] And, as for the cities\r\nunfavorably affected, the scheme based upon distance was so obviously\r\nfair that their protests were of no avail.[403]\r\n\r\nThe great contest between the trunk lines over the granting of\r\ndifferentials to Philadelphia and Baltimore, as against New York\r\nand Boston, played a not unimportant part in the diplomacy leading\r\nto the acceptance of the MacGraham system. The New York Central,\r\nthe Lake Shore, and the Boston & Albany roads, of course eagerly\r\naccepted it, because it promised aid in meeting the lake competition\r\nto which they were peculiarly exposed. The Pennsylvania and the Erie,\r\nlying considerably further from Lake Erie, would also be benefited,\r\noperating as they did in a territory naturally tributary to them, but\r\nexposed to drainage to the lakes by lateral lines. But the Baltimore\r\n& Ohio, ever since its entry into Chicago in 1874, had been a thorn\r\nin the flesh of the others. The territory along its line was so far\r\nfrom the lakes that it had little to fear from water competition at\r\nintermediate points between Chicago and the seaboard. Would it accept\r\na plan primarily intended to meet a danger which, while injuring\r\nits powerful rivals, was of less consequence to itself? Fortunately\r\nfor the scheme, it was based upon the solid principle that distance\r\nwas of preponderating influence in the adjustment of rates. The\r\nentire contention of the Baltimore & Ohio and the Pennsylvania for a\r\ndifferential rate to Baltimore and Philadelphia below New York rested\r\nupon this same principle. The distance from Chicago to the southern\r\nports was less. Consequently, they insisted, they were entitled to\r\noffer a lower rate. The MacGraham scale and the port differentials\r\nwere thus logically connected. They stood or fell together. The\r\nMacGraham plan materially aided the Baltimore & Ohio in making good\r\nits demands.[404] It was acceptable, therefore, by reason of this\r\ncollateral advantage.\r\n\r\nAnother factor in the situation appealed to the Pennsylvania and the\r\nBaltimore & Ohio. Their lines to tide water were about seventy-five and\r\none hundred miles shorter, respectively, than the shortest line to New\r\nYork.[405] In the division of the joint through rate between a chain of\r\nconnecting railway lines this was of great advantage. It always aids\r\nthe shorter line if pro-rating is based upon mileage. A feeder one\r\nhundred miles long pro-rating with a trunk line one thousand miles in\r\nlength would be entitled to only one-eleventh of the total rate. Were\r\nthe trunk line only eight hundred miles long, the neutral road might\r\nclaim one-ninth. This seemingly slight difference might mean several\r\nhundred thousand dollars more earnings to the neutral road or feeder,\r\nif it turned over its business to the short line.[406] Any emphasis\r\nupon distance as a general principle strengthened the Baltimore & Ohio\r\nin securing patronage from other roads by this means. The other trunk\r\nlines, through acceptance of the MacGraham scale, conceded the distance\r\nprinciple, and with it, coincidently, the pro-rating practice.\r\n\r\nAfter three years' experience, the MacGraham scale was readjusted\r\nto conform more closely to the cost of service principle. The plan,\r\nas thus revised, is the one still in force.[407] It recognizes that\r\nrailway charges should be proportioned to the length of haul, so far as\r\nactual costs of haulage are concerned; but it first eliminates those\r\nconstant elements in cost which do not vary with distance. The original\r\nMacGraham scale made no such distinctions. The expenses at terminals,\r\nsuch as loading and unloading, are, of course, entirely independent of\r\nthe distance covered by the shipment. These, being determined roughly\r\nby experimentation, are first deducted from an assumed Chicago rate.\r\nFrom the remainder the rate per mile by the shortest route to New York\r\n(920 miles) is then calculated by simple division. This rate per mile\r\nis then applied to the distance to any intermediate point, and the\r\nterminal charge is again added. Thus a rate is found which is reduced\r\nto a percentage of the original Chicago base rate.\r\n\r\n                         FOR ILLUSTRATION[408]\r\n\r\n                                                               Cents\r\n                                                           per 100 lbs.\r\n\r\n  Chicago to New York                                       25\r\n  Less fixed charges on both ends of the line                6\r\n                                                            --\r\n  The basis of rate for computation being the remainder, or 19\r\n  Using short line mileage 920 miles, Chicago to New York,\r\n    would yield a rate per mile                             00.0206\r\n  Short line mileage Indianapolis to New York, 833 miles,\r\n    yields a rate of                                        17.2\r\n  Plus six cents fixed charges, as above, makes             23.2\r\n  The percentage of New York rate being                     93 per cent.\r\n  Which is the present percentage basis Indianapolis to\r\n    New York\r\n  Short line mileage Frankfort, Indiana, to New York is 881\r\n    miles, which would yield at the rate of 00.0206 cents\r\n    per mile                                                18\r\n  Plus terminal charges                                      6\r\n                                                            --\r\n  Which is 96 per cent. of 25 cents                         24\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [_Facing page 364_]]\r\n\r\nThe revised system provides in theory for an absolutely constant rate\r\nper ton mile. It is a rigid mileage tariff in every respect. The\r\noriginal MacGraham scale had been so in theory, but not in practice.\r\nAs amended in conformity with a sound economic principle, it had,\r\nmoreover, one important practical advantage over the original scale.\r\nIt yielded more revenue at all the intermediate points.[409] Local\r\nrates would be higher as thus calculated than they were originally. It\r\nwould be unjust to ascribe undue importance to this motive on the part\r\nof the roads in the adoption of the new system. That the plan yielded\r\nadditional revenue, while obviously more just in theory, was naturally\r\nno objection to its acceptance.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of all this process of adjustment are depicted upon the\r\naccompanying diagram. Viewing it in a large way, and reserving details\r\nfor later consideration, we may compare it to a topographical contour\r\nmap. The several rate zones are thus analogous to a series of levels or\r\nsteps rising from east to west. Our cross section of these along a line\r\nfrom Pittsburg to Burlington, Iowa, makes this relation plain. Another\r\ncross section at right angles to the first from Louisville, Kentucky,\r\nto Lansing, Michigan, and beyond, shows how these levels are arranged\r\nin a plane from north to south. These steps form a sort of irregular\r\namphitheatre opening toward the east, with its main axis lying in a\r\ndirection slightly south of west toward St. Louis. Or, more correctly,\r\nthese rate zones, pursuing our analogy to a topographical contour map,\r\nindicate a broad valley opening toward the east. Along the bottom of\r\nthis freight-rate valley lie the great direct trunk lines converging\r\nfrom Chicago and St. Louis. Throughout the State of Illinois the valley\r\nopens up onto a plateau, somewhat grooved in the middle at Peoria,\r\nwhere the direct lines from the west cross a neutral field tributary\r\nneither to Chicago nor St. Louis exclusively.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROSS-SECTION THROUGH LOUISVILLE AND LANSING]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROSS-SECTION FROM BURLINGTON TO PITTSBURGH] This\r\ngeneral description harmonizes with the apt figure used by that master\r\nmind in railway economics, Albert Fink. Speaking of this situation, he\r\nsays, \"The trunk lines are nothing but great arteries of commerce, like\r\nrivers, only with this difference: the rivers never run across each\r\nother, the territory from which they draw their supplies is distinct\r\nand well defined.\" Since his time, by reason of coöperative action for\r\na generation, the confusing maze of railway lines has now been reduced\r\nto a single comprehensive system. Cross-currents of trade hither and\r\nthither have been united or articulated in such a way as, speaking\r\nin terms of freight charges, to cause the great internal commerce of\r\nthe country to flow downhill toward the seaboard in an orderly and\r\nreasonable way. The inequalities incident to commercial competition\r\nhave been modified, or, to revert to our original figure, eroded; so\r\nthat one may literally speak of the products of the country as flowing,\r\nlike rivers, in more or less natural channels over the railway lines\r\nfrom the great interior basin towards the Atlantic seaboard.\r\n\r\nThe mathematical precision of the method of computation heretofore\r\ndescribed, while theoretically applicable to a series of parallel roads\r\nin a flat country, free from either water competition, the competition\r\nof cross railway lines, or the competition of towns and cities of\r\nunequal size and importance, obviously requires modification to suit\r\nthe actual traffic conditions in this densely populated trunk line\r\nterritory. The process of adjustment has been gradual and necessarily\r\ntentative. Every influence brought to bear has been subversive of\r\nsystematic arrangement, tending, that is to say, to amend the scheme\r\nout of all semblance to mathematical order. After reading volumes of\r\nthe Proceedings of the Joint Rate Committee, filled with petitions of\r\nrailways, towns, and individuals for exception to the general rules,\r\none is surprised to find that, after all, the scheme is so well ordered\r\nas it is. It has been held true only by rigid adherence to the rule\r\nthat by the shortest \"workable and worked route\" no intermediate\r\nplace shall be charged more than is charged to any point beyond.\r\nIn other words, the long and short haul principle is consistently\r\nobserved. Space does not permit a discussion of all of the factors\r\nwhich have tended to modify the original simple scheme. Three alone\r\nmay be considered as illustrative of the rest. These are: (1) the\r\neffect of railway competition at the important junction points; (2) the\r\ninfluence of the independent cross lines of railway; and (3) commercial\r\ncompetition between producing or distributing centres.\r\n\r\nThe effect of railway competition at junction points is revealed at\r\nonce, upon inspection of the map, by the general law that the boundary\r\nline of zones lies immediately west of the large cities. Notice the\r\nlocation of Cleveland; Warren, Pennsylvania; Newark, Ohio; Dayton,\r\nFort Wayne, Detroit, Port Huron, Cincinnati, Indianapolis, Louisville,\r\nLansing, Logansport, Terre Haute, Peoria, and Decatur. Columbus,\r\nToledo, and Evansville, Indiana, are about the only exceptions. In\r\nnearly every case the theoretical zone boundary has been shifted in\r\nsuch a way that the rate rises just west of the important competitive\r\npoint. The reason is obvious. Rates being held down at these points,\r\nand no greater rate being possible at any other point further east,\r\nconditions must be equalized _upwards_, immediately the depressing\r\ninfluence of competition is removed. Each zone level is of necessity\r\nan average of a theoretic constantly rising scale from east to west.\r\nPlaces immediately west of an important junction point are raised\r\nsomewhat above their theoretical grade as a compensation for those\r\nplaces on the westerly side of each zone whose rate is held down below\r\ntheir theoretical level by the exigency of competition at the next\r\nlarge town. Or, to be specific, Indianapolis may hold down the rate to\r\nninety-three per cent. of the Chicago rate farther west than otherwise\r\nwould be the case. In fact, by reason of its paramount importance as a\r\nrailway centre, it has held down the rate so far west that for purposes\r\nof equalization the rate west of it immediately jumps to one hundred\r\nper cent. For, as will be observed, on inspection of the map, the\r\n96-97 per cent. zone is interrupted at this point; the 92-95 per cent.\r\nzone being extended unduly far west and the one hundred per cent. zone\r\nbeing extended inordinately far east, until the two meet just west of\r\nIndianapolis. Detailed study of the schedules and maps will reveal many\r\nsimilar instances.\r\n\r\nThe converse of the proposition that important junction points\r\nlie near the western zone boundaries is found in the fact that,\r\nwhere competition is absent, the zones sweep much farther east\r\nthan mathematically would be prescribed. In other words, wherever\r\ncompetition is less keen, the percentage rates remain high. Were\r\ncompetition entirely uniform in its geographical distribution, the\r\nseveral zones would be parallel, sweeping evenly clear across the\r\nmap. Illustration of this circumstance will be found in the extension\r\nof the 87 per cent. zone far to the east, along the Ohio river, in\r\nfact nearly to Parkersburg, West Virginia; or, again, in the 110 per\r\ncent. territory which extends nearly to Louisville. This latter rate\r\nhas been recently amended, as will be shown later; but for many years\r\ncontinued, as here represented, abnormally far to the east. In both\r\nthese instances the railway facilities along the river are monopolized\r\nby the Baltimore & Ohio as a trunk line. The only competition is due to\r\nthe Cincinnati, Hamilton & Dayton and Norfolk & Western, both of which\r\nwork their traffic from New York north. The population and traffic\r\ndensity being at the same time low, a relatively high level of rates\r\nhas resulted. Sometimes, also, it may happen that in these outlying\r\nregions the shortest line \"workable and worked\" to the seaboard may not\r\nbe due east, but may proceed north until a junction with a trunk line\r\ncan be effected.[410]\r\n\r\nThe influence of independent transverse lines of railway has been of\r\ngreat importance in shifting the zone boundaries from their theoretical\r\nlocation to conform to practical requirements. Study of the map\r\npermits a second important generalization. Not only does the boundary\r\nof the zones usually lie just west of large cities, the course of the\r\nboundary at the same time frequently follows the location of important\r\nindependent transverse railways. The zone boundary, in other words,\r\nlies just west of the cross railway line. For example, the western\r\nboundary of the 100 per cent. Chicago zone, after leaving a point on\r\nthe Illinois Central, is defined from north to south by the course of\r\nthe Chicago & Eastern Illinois Railroad, and below Terre Haute by the\r\nline of the Terre Haute & Evansville. Similarly, practical exigencies\r\ndetermined the odd shape of the 110 per cent. zone, formed like a great\r\ndistorted boot leg. The western boundary of this 110 per cent. zone\r\nfrom Peoria south closely follows the Peoria, Decatur & Evansville road\r\nnearly to the Ohio river. Similarly conditioned by railway lines are\r\nthe boundaries north and south of Indianapolis, and especially north\r\nand south of Fort Wayne, Indiana. In other cases where the transverse\r\nlines do not cross nearly at right angles with the trunk line, the\r\nzone boundary will follow one railway for some distance, and then\r\nskip across to another railway whose general direction is more nearly\r\nperpendicular to the trunk lines. Thus, from Toledo to Lima, Ohio, the\r\nwestern boundary of the 76-80 per cent. zone follows the Cincinnati,\r\nHamilton & Dayton, cutting the Baltimore & Ohio and Pennsylvania trunk\r\nlines at right angles; and then it jumps across to the east until it\r\nstrikes the sweep of the Toledo & Ohio Central, which carries it down\r\nalmost to Columbus. Similarly, the western boundary of the 66-1/2 per\r\ncent. zone follows the line of the Pittsburg & Western north from\r\nWarren, in order that that line may participate in New York business by\r\nworking its line north _via_ Painesville on the Lake Shore.\r\n\r\nWhy is it apparently necessary that these zone boundaries should\r\nfollow along just west of the cross railway lines? The reason may be\r\nmade clear by a concrete instance. Originally and until about 1891,\r\nLouisville, Kentucky, instead of having the 100 per cent. Chicago rate,\r\nas at present, enjoyed, on the base of its distance from New York,\r\nabout 96 or 97 per cent. of the Chicago rate. In other words, the\r\n96-97 per cent. zone shown on our map as interrupted at Indianapolis,\r\npartly for reasons already mentioned, originally swept across the map\r\nall the way from Grand Rapids to the Ohio river. This territory from\r\nChicago south is served by the Monon Railway (Chicago, Indianapolis\r\n& Louisville), whose line, not fully indicated on the map, thus lay\r\npartly in 100 per cent., partly in 96 per cent., and partly in 97 per\r\ncent. territory. An important part of the traffic of the Monon, as\r\nwell as of the other independent north and south lines, consists of\r\nbusiness coming in from the east at the north and worked south, or\r\ncoming in from the east at the south and worked north. Or, in other\r\nwords, this line subsisted in part upon indirectly routed tonnage\r\nfrom New York, let us say, destined for Louisville, but reaching it\r\nby way of Chicago junction points. Freight thus hauled around two\r\nsides of a triangle, instead of by a direct line, as described in\r\nChapter VIII,[411] constitutes one of the important sources of waste of\r\ntransportation energy. The Monon by such tactics is able to participate\r\nin, and to profit by, a much larger volume of through business. That\r\nis to say, its proportion of the entire haul is much greater than\r\nit would be if the business moved by the shortest line. Moreover,\r\nwhen indirectly routed, the Monon, often securing for its trunk line\r\nconnections tonnage for the east which would naturally go to other\r\ncompetitive trunk lines, is able to exact a higher pro-rating than\r\neven its extended lateral haul would justify on a strictly distance\r\nbasis. Such circumstances always greatly enhance the profitableness\r\nof lateral hauls to minor connecting roads. It is obvious that much\r\nof this transverse haulage would be impossible wherever the lateral\r\nrailway lines traverse different zones of rates. It might haul traffic\r\nfrom its 100 per cent. end to connect at its 96 per cent. end with a\r\ntrunk line for the east, but not in the opposite direction. The Monon,\r\nalways in a position to disturb the rate situation, through connection\r\nwith all the competing trunk lines, insisted upon equality of rates all\r\nalong its lines. To do this, the 100 per cent. zone had to be extended\r\neast to Indianapolis. Thereafter the Monon could profitably \"work its\r\nline in both directions.\" This illustration will serve to show why\r\nordinarily the zone boundaries conform as closely as possible to the\r\ncourse of the lateral roads. The confusion which would be engendered,\r\nwere the Peoria, Decatur & Evansville to be partly in the 110 per\r\ncent. and partly in higher percentage territory, while still insisting\r\nupon its right to work its line both ways, can readily be imagined. To\r\navoid such difficulties, the present modification of strictly distance\r\npercentages had to be adopted.\r\n\r\nThe third dominant influence, above mentioned, in modifying the\r\nmathematical precision of percentages based alone upon the distance\r\nfrom New York, has been the commercial competition of traders and\r\ncities one with another. The aim of all rate adjustment should be,\r\nand in fact, so far as possible in American railway practice, is\r\nto equalize conditions, so that the widest possible market shall\r\nresult. Producers or traders in each city demand access on even terms\r\nto all territory naturally tributary to them by reason of their\r\ngeographical location. Each particular railroad sees to it that its\r\nown patrons and cities are \"held\" in all parts of these markets, as\r\nagainst the efforts of competing railways to promote the welfare of\r\ntheir own constituencies. Consequently, the Proceedings of the Joint\r\nRate Committee are filled with discussions as to the advisability\r\nof amending general rules here and there to suit local conditions.\r\nMinor changes are continually being effected. Grand Rapids, Michigan,\r\nonce in 100 per cent. territory, asked for a 90 per cent. rate, and\r\nin 1891 secured a reduction to 96 per cent.[412] Louisville, once\r\nin 97 per cent. territory, is now a 100 per cent. point. Shifts in\r\nboth directions have frequently occurred, as the following table of\r\npercentages shows:[413]--\r\n\r\n  -------------------------+---------+--------+----------+-----------\r\n  Basis                    | Detroit | Toledo | Sandusky | Cleveland\r\n  -------------------------+---------+--------+----------+-----------\r\n  April 13, 1876           | 85      |  78    |    71    |   65\r\n  June 23,  1879[414]      | 81.5    |  81.5  |    78    |   73.5\r\n  April 14, 1880           | 75.5[415]| 75.5  |    75.5  |   70\r\n  Present  (1900)          | 78      |  78    |    78    |   71\r\n  -------------------------+---------+--------+----------+-----------\r\n\r\nA number of changes were made in 1887 in order to conform to the long\r\nand short haul clause. Flint, Michigan, for example, was reduced from\r\n95 to 92 per cent.; Ashtabula, Ohio, from 71 to 67; while Springfield,\r\nOhio, was raised from 82 to 83 per cent.[416] Detroit has been most\r\nactive in prosecuting its claims for a reduced percentage.[417] But\r\nthe Interstate Commerce Commission in 1888 upheld the present status.\r\nA recent minor change is indicative of the forces which must be dealt\r\nwith. Evansville, Indiana, on the Ohio river, according to our map, is\r\na 110 per cent. point. Vincennes, Indiana, lies just north of it in the\r\n108 per cent. triangular zone. Since this plate was made, Evansville\r\nhas been reduced to 105 and Vincennes to 103 per cent., respectively.\r\nThis is substantially, I am told, on a mileage basis. The reason for\r\nthe amendment is that certain important industries are located at these\r\npoints. Either to favor them specially or to remove a pre-existing\r\ndisability in competition with other towns, this change was insisted\r\nupon by the railways interested in their prosperity. By tentative\r\nprocesses of adjustment like this the present general relations have\r\nbeen established.[418] They have been kept constant only by the steady\r\nresistance of the majority of carriers to action which is in the\r\ninterest of a few. Judged by results, it would appear that the broad\r\nview has, in the main, prevailed.\r\n\r\nThe actual situation resulting from the above-named causes, it should\r\nbe observed, is not quite as simple as our map makes it appear. Most\r\nof the zones are in fact subdivided into minor gradations. Thus the\r\nclosely dotted zone designated \"86-90 incl.\" is constituted of an 87\r\nper cent. area up as far as the railway from Dayton to Indianapolis;\r\nwhile the rest of it is broken up into little 88, 89, and 90 per\r\ncent. areas, respectively. The same thing occurs elsewhere. Our\r\nmap generalizes the results, in an effort to bring out the zone\r\nrelationships as fully as is technically possible in a single diagram.\r\nCertain of the zones, however, such as the 60, 66-1/2, 100, and 110 per\r\ncent. territories, are bounded exactly as here represented.\r\n\r\nAs for direction, the original scale was intended only for eastbound\r\ntraffic. Westbound rates were lower and more regular. But the system\r\nworked so well that it was soon extended to cover the westbound\r\nbusiness. Owing to difficulties of routing, in order to transport by\r\nthe shortest line into Chicago, these westbound percentages were often\r\nquite different from those in the opposite direction.[419] Detroit, for\r\ninstance, for some time prior to 1886, enjoyed a 70 per cent. rate west\r\nbound, while its percentage in the opposite direction was 78.[420] But,\r\nafter the passage of the Act to Regulate Commerce in 1887, efforts\r\nwere made to harmonize the differences.[421] At the present time the\r\nrates east and west are in most cases the same.\r\n\r\nAt this point it is essential to understand the limitations within\r\nwhich this percentage system is confined. It does not necessarily\r\ndetermine the exact rate to be applied in practice from every little\r\nstation in trunk line territory. For, in the first place, it concerns\r\nonly the so-called common points; that is to say, points where\r\ncompetition of two or more carriers is effective. Purely local stations\r\nare charged an \"arbitrary\" into the nearest common point.[422] But,\r\ninasmuch as throughout this much be-railroaded country most shippers\r\nare less than twenty miles from the next line,[423] and since,\r\nmoreover, the arbitrary can never raise the local rate above the\r\nrate to the next common point beyond,[424] the scale is practically\r\neffective everywhere. A more important consideration is the fact that\r\nthis scale, even for common points, does not positively fix the rate.\r\nIt merely provides a minimum below which rates shall not be reduced,\r\nexcept by authority of the roads acting jointly. It is a minimum, not a\r\nmaximum, schedule in every sense. Its provisions are never promulgated\r\nin the form of tariffs as such. They are rarely known to shippers, but\r\nserve only as a guide to traffic officials. The Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission, in sanctioning the system, has expressly recognized this\r\nfact.[425] Moreover, these percentage rates applied at first to\r\n\"classified\" tonnage. They were soon, however, extended to include the\r\ngreat bulk of commodity or special rates which are independently made.\r\nAnd I am informed by the chairman of the Trunk Line Association that\r\nthe MacGraham table was applied to special rates--such as sugar, coffee\r\nand molasses--as early as 1871.\r\n\r\nOther exceptions to the applicability of this percentage system\r\ndeserve mention, although they are of relative unimportance. Principal\r\namong these is the confusion engendered in Illinois territory\r\nthrough the entry of the western lines into Chicago. Throughout\r\ntheir constituencies, by reason of the sparse population, freedom\r\nfrom competition, inequality of east, and westbound tonnage, and\r\nlow-grade freight, western railroad rates per ton mile are very much\r\nhigher than on the trunk lines. Moreover, they are naturally desirous\r\nof as long a haul as possible, namely into Chicago. To turn over\r\ntheir local Illinois traffic to the trunk line feeders exposes them\r\nfinancially to the same losses as those above mentioned in the case\r\nof lateral independent lines further east. But these western lines,\r\nbeing stronger, have insisted upon recognition of their claims to a\r\nproportion of the through rate which would at least \"pay for their\r\naxle grease.\"[426] The result is that throughout Illinois, especially\r\nin the north and toward the Mississippi, the distance principle is\r\nconsiderably distorted, as our map clearly shows. The percentage system\r\npractically excludes freight \"from beyond,\" the rates on that being\r\ndetermined by other rules.[427]\r\n\r\nEast of the Central Traffic Association territory shown on our map\r\nthe same percentage system is extended to points in New York and\r\nPennsylvania.[428] Suppose, for example, the rate were desired from\r\nColumbus, Ohio, to Albany, New York, or any other point between Buffalo\r\nand New York City. The rate from Columbus to New York City would\r\nfirst be determined as a percentage of the Chicago-New York rate,\r\nunder the system already described. Then from Columbus to Albany the\r\nrate would be prescribed as a new percentage of this percentage. The\r\ninitial western points, however, are not determined individually, but\r\nare comprehended in large groups. Thus the rate from all points in the\r\n72-78 per cent. territory, shown on our map, to Albany, New York, is\r\n96 per cent. of what the rate would be from those points to New York\r\nCity. Syracuse has 76 and Utica 87 per cent., respectively, of the\r\nrate from any point in this 72-78 per cent. territory. From points\r\nbeyond Chicago, taking, that is to say, more than 100 per cent. of the\r\nNew York-Chicago rate, the percentages of the rate to New York City\r\napplying to Albany, Syracuse, and Utica are correspondingly modified to\r\n96, 84, and 91, respectively. Other complications, such as the addition\r\nof arbitraries to Boston and New England points or the subtraction of\r\ndifferentials to Baltimore and Philadelphia, follow. But, in the main,\r\nconforming always to the long and short haul principle,[429] rates to\r\nall local stations are prescribed within narrow limits by means of a\r\nsmall number of these fixed points. The system is the same, although\r\ndetails may vary. Everything interlocks and is harmoniously related on\r\nthe distance basis.\r\n\r\nRates from one point to another within the Central Traffic Association\r\nterritory shown on our map now alone remain for consideration. These\r\ncannot, of course, be adjusted on a percentage basis, inasmuch as\r\nsuch traffic may not be east or west bound at all, but may consist\r\nof shipments in any direction. There is no logical reason why they\r\nshould interlock with east or westbound through rates when the traffic\r\nis, perhaps, moving locally north and south. Nevertheless, the long\r\nand short haul principle is observed with the same fidelity. A rigid\r\ndistance tariff for short hauls, the limits of which are prescribed by\r\nthe rates for long hauls under the MacGraham schedule, prevails.[430]\r\nFor distances up to 75 miles this conforms closely to the rates\r\noriginally prescribed by the Ohio legislature. For greater distances\r\nit is much lower than the Ohio tariff.[431] Thus the Ohio rate for 350\r\nmiles is 87.5 cents, while the C. F. A. (Central Freight Association)\r\nscale is only 42 cents. The Ohio scale for 200 miles is 50 cents, the\r\nC. F. A. rate for the same distance is only 33 cents. Thus it appears\r\nthat this C. F. A. tariff, applicable to interstate business and beyond\r\ncontrol of any state legislature, has, in reality, been voluntarily\r\nadopted by the interested railroads. The tariff is only a minimum\r\nscale, below which the roads agree not to reduce rates, and above which\r\nthe actual rates often rise.[432] Nevertheless, the fact remains that\r\nthese rates, according to distance, are so much lower than the Illinois\r\nRailroad Commission's tariff that Chicago and other distributing\r\ncentres throughout the State of Illinois claim that it works great\r\nhardship to them. The situation in Illinois is geographically peculiar.\r\nIts great commercial centre is in the extreme northeastern corner,\r\nwhile, at the same time, the greatest extension of the state is north\r\nand south. These circumstances, coupled with an interstate (C. F. A.)\r\ntariff lower than the Illinois official tariff under which Chicago\r\nmerchants must ship out their goods, enable Detroit, Indianapolis,\r\nand Cincinnati to undersell Chicago in its own state. Chicago can be\r\nequalized there only by special or secret rates.[433] Other local\r\ncentres, like Quincy, Illinois, joined with Chicago in this complaint\r\nto the Illinois Railroad Commission that their rates were too\r\nhigh.[434] Think of it! Shippers complaining that a government rate was\r\ntoo high, and requesting that the railway tariff (C. F. A. schedule)\r\nbe adopted in its place! Is that not evidence that reasonable treatment\r\nof its shippers by railway companies is appreciated by the public?\r\nWithout undue extension further details of this interesting controversy\r\ncannot be given. It will suffice to state that in December, 1905,\r\nthe Illinois Railroad Commission ordered a reduction of its official\r\nschedule by 20 per cent., in an attempt to reduce its rates to conform\r\nmore nearly to the C. F. A. railway tariff.\r\n\r\nThe evils incident upon two conflicting governmental authorities, State\r\nand Federal, each attempting to regulate rates independently, are\r\nclearly indicated in the preceding paragraph. The Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission has been brought flatly up against them in one of its\r\nrecent Texas cases.[435] Local and interstate rates must inevitably be\r\nadjusted with reference to one another, so complex are the conditions\r\nof commercial competition. While the plain people remained unsatisfied\r\nthat any real Federal regulative power existed, it was inevitable that\r\nthe number of arbitrary state tariffs, like those of Illinois and,\r\nmore recently, of Missouri, should tend to increase. But now since the\r\namplified Federal powers under the laws of 1906 and 1910, any clash\r\nbetween the two must result in limitations placed upon state activity.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[389] Compare chap.

A hypothetical instance will serve\r\nas illustration. Suppose a point with an 80 per cent. rate on the old\r\nschedule. When Chicago paid 25 cents, the rate to this point would be\r\n20 cents. Under the new scheme the intermediate rate would be 80 per\r\ncent. of 19 cents, or 15.2 cents, plus 6 cents terminal charge, making\r\na total of 21.2 cents. This is 84.8 per cent. of the Chicago rate\r\ninstead of 80 per cent. as before. Compare table, p. 373, _infra_.\r\n\r\n[410] Thus from Ironton, in the 87 per cent. zone south of Columbus,\r\nOhio, the distance to Columbus is 127 miles, added to 638 miles from\r\nColumbus to New York makes a total of 765 miles.

Public dissatisfaction\r\nwas long voiced by a large number of complaints before the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission in the early days,--a cessation of these complaints\r\nsince 1900, however, was the result of the nullification of the law by\r\njudicial interpretation, rather than an indication of any acquiescence\r\nof the public in the scheme. Next to settlement of the problem of\r\ntranscontinental rates, a reasonable adjustment of the southern\r\nsituation is one of the important tasks confronting the Federal\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nCertain natural features of southern territory are connected with\r\nits peculiar rate system. The first of these is its scattered and\r\nrelatively thin settlement. Density of population varies between\r\none-third and one-fourth of that in the northern states. This greatly\r\nlimits the volume of local business. In the second place, the largely\r\nagricultural character of the country, yielding a traffic predominantly\r\nof low grade, has had a great effect. Much attention being devoted to\r\ncotton, there is little local interchange of freight. The business,\r\nmoreover, is largely seasonal in character. In the early days, at\r\nleast, practically all of the profits of the carriers had to be made\r\nbetween September and January. This concentration of interest in the\r\nmovement of the cotton crop is now rapidly being supplanted by a much\r\nmore general movement of traffic; but the rate system in force is an\r\noutgrowth of the conditions prevalent in the early days.\r\n\r\nThe entire dependence of this territory for manufactured goods upon\r\nthe northeastern states, and for foodstuffs upon the West, has had\r\na profound effect, we have seen, upon its railway development.[437]\r\nThe predominant direction of traffic is rendered quite peculiar by\r\ncontrast with trunk line territory. In the North, the principal\r\nrailroads lie parallel, east and west; in the South, they are radially\r\ndistributed outward from Atlanta like the spokes of a wheel. Imagine a\r\ntriangle with its apex at this city,--the focus of all transportation\r\ninterests in the South,--and with its other two angles lying at New\r\nYork and Chicago respectively. The hollow centre of this triangle, as\r\nappears by the accompanying map, is occupied by the Allegheny mountain\r\nchain. The movement of traffic historically along the western side\r\nof this triangle has been overwhelmingly southward; at one time the\r\ndisproportion southbound from western territory being as thirteen to\r\none.[438] Along the eastern side of this triangle,--that is to say\r\nparallel with the Atlantic seaboard,--the preponderance of tonnage,\r\nby bulk and probably by value as well, has been toward the north. In\r\nthis direction cotton in the early days, and latterly lumber, have\r\nmoved from southern fields and forests to northeastern markets. In\r\nVirginia-Carolina territory, today, about three-fifths of the loaded\r\nmileage is north bound. The uneven distribution of traffic is still\r\nfurther complicated by the excess of tonnage eastbound in trunk line\r\nterritory along the northern side of our triangle, above mentioned.\r\nThis general description explains many of the abnormalities in freight\r\nrates throughout this territory. Bulky staples moving one way, while\r\nmanufactured goods, high in value but more concentrated in weight, go\r\nthe other, greatly complicate the problem of economical operation.\r\n\r\nAnother omnipresent complication in the southern states is the\r\nwidespread existence of water competition. The situation in the South\r\nin this regard is not unlike that of England. Its entire territory\r\nis threaded with a series of more or less navigable watercourses\r\nwhich penetrate from the seaboard or the Mississippi river, far into\r\nthe interior. Here again is a physical peculiarity of the southern\r\nterritory, which historically explains, even if it does not fully\r\njustify, as we shall see, certain peculiarities of its freight rate\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP SHOWING PRINCIPAL RAILROAD SYSTEMS IN THE SOUTHERN\r\nSTATES\r\n\r\n[Facing page 382]]\r\n\r\nThe first general characteristic of the southern system is the\r\nrelatively high level of freight rates. Bearing in mind that the\r\ndistance from New York to Chicago is practically the same as from\r\nNew York to Atlanta, the freight rate, first-class, on the trunk lines\r\nwas, in 1900, 75 cents per hundredweight as against $1.14 to Atlanta.\r\nSixth-class rates then stood to one another as 25 cents and 45 cents\r\nrespectively, the relatively high ones being in the South. Reference,\r\nfor example, to the table on page 349, will bring out this contrast\r\nat the present time in another way. According to this the rates in\r\nthe South are not higher than in the West for the same distance. The\r\ndisproportionately high charges in the South, however, occur mainly in\r\nthe field of local rates. And it is the local, rather than the through,\r\ncharges, which cause the present dissatisfaction. The principal\r\ncomplaint concerning through rates is that they are made up principally\r\nas the sum of locals based upon Ohio or Mississippi gateways.[439]\r\nWhenever such sums of locals have given place to unbroken through\r\nrates, a large measure of satisfaction to shippers has resulted. And\r\nthen, finally, it should be observed that certain peculiarities of\r\nthe classification system somewhat increase the relatively high grade\r\nof charges throughout this territory,[440] tending to support the\r\nallegation that rates are unreasonably high.\r\n\r\nThe so-called basing point system is the second fundamental peculiarity\r\nof southern rate adjustment. It has already been discussed in\r\nconnection with local discrimination.[441] This basing point system,\r\nalthough not absolutely confined to the South, has been more highly\r\ndeveloped here than elsewhere. In principle it is simply this: certain\r\ncities are established as basing points,[442] and rates to all other\r\nplaces in that neighborhood are made by adding to the through\r\nrate into the basing point, the local from that city to the final\r\ndestination. Since local rates in the South, based upon slender local\r\ntraffic, are always exceedingly high, this appears to confer a very\r\ngreat advantage in the matter of charges on the cities thus favored.\r\nThe way in which this system is opposed to the long and short haul\r\nprinciple in law has also been discussed in another connection.[443]\r\nOn the face of things it certainly appears unjust that goods should be\r\ntransported directly through the place to which they are ultimately to\r\ngo; and after being hauled to the basing point with a heavy charge for\r\nthat haul, should thereafter be brought back again with the addition of\r\na second high local rate for the service. And yet that very commonly\r\noccurs.\r\n\r\nA number of economic defences for the basing point system have been\r\nurged by the carriers at different times. The most substantial one\r\nis that the basing points, historically, were originally important\r\ntrade centres and are still intimately related to the business customs\r\nof the South.[444] These trade centres, it is alleged, were not\r\nmade by the railroads: they were in existence before the railroads\r\nwere constructed. They are an outgrowth of the agricultural system\r\nof the region. In the West a farmer may take a sample of his grain\r\nto the nearest town and sell the whole crop by that sample. No such\r\ntransaction is possible with cotton and tobacco. Each shipment must\r\nbe sampled, weighed and classified on its own merits. Such grading\r\ncannot take place at local stations. Convenient commercial centres\r\nare, therefore, a necessity, serving for the proper concentration of\r\nproducts. These trade centres, moreover, arising in connection with the\r\nsale of staple products of the soil, became natural distributing or\r\njobbing points. The planters naturally buy in the places to which they\r\nresort to sell their crops, often employing the same merchant.[445]\r\nAs such natural trading centres, these southern towns are forced to\r\ncompete with the older established distributing cities up north. At\r\nthis point a second defence of the basing point system arises.[446]\r\nIt is urged that a decentralization of jobbing trade in a sparsely\r\nsettled or newly developed territory can be effected only by means of\r\nencouragement through peculiarly favorable rates to offset the strength\r\nof the remoter great cities. The plausibility of this defence, however,\r\nis considerably weakened by the fact that under the peculiar southern\r\nclassification system, carload ratings are largely absent.[447]\r\nTherefore, as it appears, the local jobber in the South competes under\r\na disability as compared with New York and Cincinnati which is no\r\nless at the basing point than in the small town. Still a third, and\r\nprobably a valid, defense of this violation of the distance principle\r\nby the use of basing points, is the paucity of local business. It is\r\nalleged that in the North the competitive points are so near together,\r\nand the volume of competitive business is so large, that it pays to\r\nreduce the charges at immediate points. In the South, on the other\r\nhand, competitive points are so far apart and, relatively speaking, the\r\nlocal tonnage is so small, that the adoption of such a policy would be\r\nruinous.[448]\r\n\r\nThe most prominent defence of the basing point system brought forward\r\nat all times, and greatly emphasized in proceedings before the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission, is the widespread existence of water\r\ncompetition. Carriers allege that in order to secure any portion\r\nof the traffic at many points, low rates must be offered, quite\r\nirrespective of the charges to intermediate inland stations. They\r\naffirm that to lower all rates to this \"compelled\" competitive level,\r\nwould deplete their revenues and lead to bankruptcy. This has been\r\nthe main excuse for the persistent violation of the long and short\r\nhaul clause by carriers in the southern states down to the present\r\ntime. The evidence goes to show, however, that on the lesser streams,\r\nat least, the steamers are so small, their service so irregular, and\r\nthe incidental risk of damage, cost of insurance and other expenses\r\nof transhipment are so great, that the railroads practically control\r\nthe business.[449] Furthermore, in many places it appears that the\r\nwater lines were either owned by the railroads or appeared in league\r\nwith them; or else that a division of the business had been effected\r\nby which the little river steamers were accorded a certain proportion\r\nof the low grade freight.[450] Such facts have been established before\r\nthe Interstate Commerce Commission, for example, in the so-called\r\nDawson case concerning the Chattahoochee river; on the Ocmulgee at\r\nMacon in the Griffin and Hawkinsville cases; at Montgomery in the Troy\r\ncase; and on the St. Johns river at Palatka, Florida, in the Hampton\r\ncase. A competent witness has declared in fact that there is \"no more\r\nreal water competition at many of these places than in the Rocky\r\nMountains.\"[451] Probably the potentiality of competition is somewhat\r\ngreater today with improvement of the larger navigable waterways.\r\nIt seems to be real at Chattanooga since the construction of the\r\nMussel Shoals canal; but that it has in late years been effective at\r\nNashville seems open to question. The practical disappearance of the\r\nMississippi river traffic also points to the decline in importance of\r\nthe great rivers as rate regulators, except in respect of the carriage\r\nof ore, lumber, and coal. Whether the National Waterways movement\r\nwill ever succeed in its revival is, it seems to me, open to serious\r\nquestion.[452]\r\n\r\nAnalyzing these several grounds of defence, a distinction should be\r\nmade at the start between three varieties of basing point. This is not\r\nclearly brought out in the numerous decisions upon rates in southern\r\nterritory. In the first group are the old natural trading centres,\r\nusually once blessed with effective competition by water, even if at\r\nthe present this is of limited character. Savannah and Montgomery,\r\nAlabama, are of this type. Then, secondly, there are the great railroad\r\ncentres like Atlanta and Birmingham. These are modern creations without\r\nwater competition of any sort, although the rivalry of railroads\r\nwith one another is exceedingly keen. Until recently, moreover, this\r\ncompetition has been over such widely divergent routes that agreement\r\nhas been difficult and consolidation impossible.[453] And, then, in the\r\nthird place, there are the basing points which seem to be absolutely\r\nartificial. A number of these are to be found in the southeastern part\r\nof Georgia, such as Cordele, Americus, Albany, etc. In these cases the\r\nonly criterion which seems to have been adopted is that the place shall\r\nhave attained sufficient importance to enable it to compel some carrier\r\nto give it special privileges in the matter of rates. As was tersely\r\nstated in a leading case--Cordele at that time not having been made a\r\nbasing point:[454]\r\n\r\n    \"Cordele is not treated by defendant roads as a competitive\r\n    point, because it is not a sufficiently large distributing\r\n    point, and it is not such a distributing point because it is\r\n    not treated as a competitive point. Hence it appears that the\r\n    roads seek to excuse their wrong-doing by offering the results\r\n    of the wrong in justification. Judged by its results, this\r\n    system of rate making is at variance with all the equality\r\n    provisions of the act to regulate commerce.\"\r\n\r\nThe subsequent experience in this last case is significant. One of the\r\ncarriers at Cordele having afterwards discovered the advantage to\r\nitself in making this town a basing point, all the other railroads were\r\ncompelled to acquiesce. Such a thing has happened frequently throughout\r\nthe South; with the result that many places have been given strongly\r\npreferential rates for no other reason than the arbitrary decision of\r\nsome one of the carriers. Even the railroads themselves recognize this\r\nfact. They often deplore the necessity for reducing rates because of\r\naction by competitors at some particular point; but no option remains.\r\nIt is with reference to this third class of purely artificial basing\r\npoints that the most dissatisfaction among shippers arises.\r\n\r\nThe awkward and unreasonable situation is well exemplified in a very\r\nrecent case,--important, also, because it was the first to be decided\r\nby the Interstate Commerce Commission under its new and enlarged\r\npowers. The location of Ashburn in southeastern Georgia, a county\r\nseat with a population of about 2,200, is shown with references to\r\nsurrounding places by the map on opposite page.[455] It lies in the\r\ncentre of an irregular quadrilateral, the corners of which are occupied\r\nby Cordele, Albany, Tifton and Fitzgerald. It has no commercial\r\nstanding at present, but, being as large at least as Tifton, aspires\r\nto become a distributing centre in its immediate neighborhood. Yet\r\nfrom every direction its rates are made by a combination upon these\r\nsurrounding towns. The disparity is illustrated by the charges from\r\nNew York, which are $1.42 per hundredweight, first class, as compared\r\nwith $1.17 to all the neighboring places. Examination of the history\r\nof these favored towns shows, however, that they have acquired their\r\nfavored status as basing points, neither because they were originally\r\nimportant trading centres, nor because they enjoyed water competition.\r\nTwo of them, actually, are as remote from streams as is Ashburn. The\r\nfact is that the competition of western and eastern dealers with one\r\nanother, backed in each case by local railroads having routes or\r\naffiliations either northeast or northwest, has brought about their\r\nestablishment as basing points. Neither is Ashburn today more of a\r\nlocal point than either Tifton or Cordele when they were first granted\r\nlower rates. As one examines further, it appears that this keenness\r\nof trade competition between East and West,--that is to say, from\r\nBaltimore and New York as against Cincinnati and Chicago, etc.,--which\r\nhas brought Atlanta into prominence and made it finally the key to\r\nthe entire southern rate arch,[456] has in the same manner led to the\r\nspecial favors granted to one town as against another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn this case the Interstate Commerce Commission ordered an\r\nequalization between all five points. It is to be hoped that this\r\nspecial case may be a point of departure for a general reform in the\r\nimmediate future of the entire iniquitous scheme of local favoritism\r\nwhich has too long been allowed to exist.\r\n\r\nThe entire artificiality and even at times iniquity of the basing point\r\nsystem is admitted in the following brief for the railways in the\r\nAlabama Midland case before the Supreme Court of the United States.\r\n\"There may be,\" it is conceded, \"a few mere 'railroad junctions' in\r\nthe South, which, owing to the ignorance or corruption of certain\r\nrailroad officials, have been arbitrarily 'called' competitive points\r\nand which 'receive' certain arbitrary 'concessions' in rates to which\r\nthey are not justly entitled. There may be also a few strictly local\r\nstations in the South, which are not even 'railroad junctions,' where\r\narbitrary and unfair 'concessions' in rates have been made by certain\r\ncorrupt railroad officials, to enhance the value of property owned at\r\nsuch stations by said officials, or by their relatives or friends ...\r\n[but they are] the offspring of ignorance or corruption and should not\r\nbe recognized by the courts.\" This artificiality is also proven by the\r\ndifference of practice which exists on the various southern roads.[457]\r\nThe worst offender and most defiant opponent of the government from the\r\ninception of Federal regulation, has been the Louisville & Nashville\r\nRailroad. The Southern Railway introduced the long and short haul\r\nprinciple in the main on its through line to Atlanta long ago. On the\r\nAtlantic Coast Line few violations of the distance principle exist,\r\nand the condition is improving. No basing points whatever exist in\r\nSouth Carolina; and the state railroad commissions in general are\r\nworking for betterment. Neither the Chesapeake & Ohio nor the Norfolk &\r\nWestern, operating alike in sparsely settled regions, find it necessary\r\nto violate the distance principle. One of the curses of the scheme,\r\nhowever, is that irregularity of one carrier may compel its neighbors\r\nto adopt a policy which they recognize as unjust. Only by compulsion\r\napplied to all alike can a just solution be had.\r\n\r\nA determined effort was made in 1880 by the carriers themselves to\r\napply the trunk line rate system, based upon the distance principle,\r\nto the southern states.[458] A thoroughgoing scientific readjustment\r\nwas proposed. The situation is significantly described in the following\r\nextract from this report:\r\n\r\n    \"Your committee entered upon the performance of their duty\r\n    entertaining the sentiment that experience and observation have\r\n    rendered generally potent among those in charge of the revenue\r\n    interest of transportation lines, namely, the necessity for\r\n    more intelligent and defensible methods of making competitive\r\n    freight rates than the following of figures, descending to\r\n    us from tariffs named on arbitrary bases or conditions now\r\n    obsolete, or by the assumption of differences between centres\r\n    of trade now changed or junction points now no longer such,\r\n    or other methods for which there are no reasons capable of\r\n    satisfactory explanation.\"\r\n\r\nRepresentatives of most of the important lines subscribed to this\r\nplan; but it fell through at the last because of the opposition of\r\nothers, selfishly viewing their own particular interests rather than\r\nthe general welfare of all. It is clear that while minor improvements\r\nmay be introduced, no widespread reform can be effected without the\r\ninterposition of Federal authority. It is to be hoped that this\r\nexercise of authority under the larger powers now conferred by Congress\r\nsince 1906 may not long be withheld.\r\n\r\nA third and essentially different problem respecting southern rates\r\nconcerns the discrimination against western cities in favor of those\r\nalong the Atlantic seaboard. This has been for years before the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission in the Cincinnati and Chicago Freight\r\nBureau cases.[459] The amount of this discrimination appears in\r\nthe fact that at the time of the original complaint, the rate from\r\nCincinnati to Atlanta was ninety-four per cent. of the rate from\r\nNew York to the same point; although the distance from Cincinnati\r\nwas scarcely more than half of that from New York. It appears as if\r\nthis difference were largely the result of keen water competition\r\nby coastwise steamers,--a competition which affects rates for a\r\nconsiderable distance inland all along the coast as far as New Orleans.\r\nWhere such water competition is absent, there seems to be a general\r\narrangement as between East and West which is standardized by distance.\r\nAtlanta gives the keynote; and all rates from outside southern\r\nterritory change with its fluctuations. The disability against western\r\ncities may be expressed, therefore, in another way, by the fact that\r\nNew York, although so much farther north than Baltimore,--supposed\r\ntheoretically to be kept on a par with Louisville as to rates,--reaches\r\nAtlanta on lower charges than are made to Cincinnati.\r\n\r\nFortunately an attempt at improvement of the southern rate system\r\nwill be greatly aided by the wonderful industrial revival which has\r\nbeen under way during the last decade. The growth of population, and\r\nespecially the development of manufactures, may render it possible for\r\nthe carriers to endure the hardship which any traffic readjustment\r\nalways entails. The growth of manufactures, measuring in a way the\r\ndegree to which the South is learning to supply its own needs,\r\nappears in the fact that in 1907 it converted one-fifth of its cotton\r\nproduction into cloth, and reduced from its own ores one-half of its\r\nconsumption of pig iron in its own local factories. Furniture shipments\r\nto the South were once large. At the present time High Point, North\r\nCarolina, is second only to Grand Rapids in this line of manufacture.\r\nEvery new mill and mercantile establishment which springs up, is bound\r\nto help to a degree in the transition from a mediaeval scheme of rate\r\nmaking to a more defensible system.\r\n\r\nThe Texas \"common point\" system affords a valuable illustration of\r\nthe influence of competitive forces in trade in bringing about an\r\nequalization of transportation charges over a wide area.[460] It also\r\nshows the danger of localization of interest through the exercise of\r\npiecemeal control by state commissions rather than the enforcement of\r\nbroad-gauge regulation by the Federal government. The settlement of\r\nthe great area of Texas naturally first took place by extension inland\r\nfrom the Gulf coast. All supplies came by sea from the north. Freight\r\nschedules were scaled from the seaboard according to distance, more or\r\nless, in competition with stage and wagon. Gradually, however, with\r\nthe growth of St. Louis as a rival centre of distribution, railroads\r\nserving that city penetrated directly from the northeast. The St.\r\nLouis jobbers were at once brought into keen rivalry with merchants\r\nin North Atlantic states, served by coastwise steamship lines. This\r\ncompetition beginning at the points of contact of the two different\r\nsets of railroads, gradually extended all over the state. St. Louis\r\nlines, acting for local jobbers whose goods came from New York, might\r\nnot charge more at any point in the aggregate than the total rate from\r\nthe same initial city which applied by way of the Gulf steamers. Nor\r\ncould the railroads in from the Gulf ask more for both steamer and\r\nrail carriage than the entire double charge from New York around by\r\nway of St. Louis. The natural stronghold of the Gulf lines was in the\r\ncentre and the south; northern Texas was more naturally tributary to\r\nSt. Louis; but gradually a compromise was effected whereby equality of\r\nrates was accorded either from New York or St. Louis to all stations\r\nthroughout the state. Thus arose the so-called Texas Common Point\r\nTerritory, to all parts of which Kansas City, Chicago, and finally all\r\nother distant cities were admitted on even terms.\r\n\r\nAnother feature of the Texas rate adjustment is suggestive.\r\n\r\nA vast territory, uniform in products and needs, might either be\r\nserved by a few great distributing centres or by a larger number\r\nof smaller ones, each forming the natural focus of trade within a\r\ngiven district. Believing the latter arrangement to be better suited\r\nto local conditions, the Texas Railway Commission has arbitrarily\r\nprescribed such intrastate tariffs as to foster the development of\r\na number of such jobbing points or mercantile centres. Local rates,\r\nmore or less proportioned according to distance, are graded up to\r\na maximum, all based principally upon the needs of the principal\r\ncity, Houston, as served by its seaport, Galveston. The significant\r\nfeature of these Texas local rates, however, is the fact that beyond a\r\nfixed maximum,--say 245 miles on classified tonnage, or 160 miles on\r\ncotton,--no further increase of rate occurs with extension of the haul.\r\nThat is to say, beyond a certain radius fixed by the maximum rate,\r\ndistributing centres are placed upon an entire parity with one another.\r\nFort Worth, for example, within a distance of about two hundred miles,\r\nnaturally has an advantage over all other competing centres, more\r\ndistantly located; but outside of this zone, naturally tributary to\r\nit as a provincial trade centre, all others such as Dallas, Waco,\r\nor San Antonio enjoy equal opportunity. In only one respect is the\r\ndistance principle violated: namely, in the preferential rates from\r\nthe north to Houston and Galveston as compared with the higher charges\r\nto intermediate Texas points. These primary centres are encouraged by\r\nstanding in a class by themselves.\r\n\r\nThis theoretically admirable Texas system is, however, unstable in\r\nseveral regards. It is artificial in that it is primarily adjusted\r\nto the needs of the state, without reference to the rights of other\r\nplaces lying beyond its borders.[461] The railroads naturally desire to\r\ncontract the common point territory; the forces of trade rivalry seek\r\nto enlarge it. The growth of middle western cities and manufactures,\r\nsupplying Texas from their own domestic plants rather than merely\r\nredistributing goods manufactured in the East, also tends to modify\r\nthe scheme. Whether the common point system, therefore, can long\r\nwithstand the force of these disintegrating influences remains to be\r\nseen. The conditions are not compact and homogeneous as they are in New\r\nEngland, which enjoys a similar flat rate system. And it may well be\r\nthat ambitious cities along the northwestern border of the state, like\r\nFort Worth, may finally succeed in forcing concessions in rates from\r\nthe Middle West on the ground of their relative nearness as compared\r\nwith competitors further south. On the other hand, distributing centres\r\nfarthest away from the main sources of supply, like San Antonio, would\r\nnaturally resist any infraction of the rule of parity. And then, again,\r\nit is becoming apparent that the decentralization of distribution\r\nthrough a number of second-rate jobbing towns rather than from one\r\npreëminent centre, is hindering the growth of a metropolis, able to\r\ncompete on even terms in high grade products with the older centres of\r\nthe East. Few dealers in Texas cities are able to purchase dry goods or\r\nboots and shoes in carload lots, that is to say, on the lowest terms as\r\nconcerns freight rates; and the combination of shipments of different\r\ngoods to make up a miscellaneous carload rate, thus overcoming this\r\ndisadvantage, is open to serious objection.[462] All told, therefore,\r\nthe experience of Texas is well worth attentive consideration, as a\r\nstudy in the intimate relationship between trade and transportation.\r\nThe sharpness of contrast between such a common point scheme and the\r\nbasing point system of the other southern states, brings the relative\r\nadvantages and defects of each into strong relief.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTranscontinental freight rates have been brought into prominence of\r\nlate in direct connection with the wonderful growth of population\r\nand trade on the Pacific slope.[463] Our territorial possessions in\r\nthe Pacific and the development of Oriental trade, together with the\r\ngeneral interest in the Panama Canal since 1900, have all conspired to\r\ndirect attention to this complicated problem. The first point to notice\r\nis the relatively high level of rates, averaging very much more per\r\nmile than anywhere else in the United States. The following table of\r\nrates in 1905 is significant:\r\n\r\n  ------+---------------------------------------+------------------\r\n  Miles |                                       |      Class\r\n  ------+---------------------------------------+---------+--------\r\n        |              From                     |    1    |    5\r\n  ------+---------------------------------------+---------+--------\r\n   912  | Chicago to New York                   |  $0.75  |  $0.30\r\n   912  | Chicago to New Orleans                |   1.10  |   0.47\r\n  2328  | Chicago to San Francisco              |   3.00  |   1.65\r\n  ------+---------------------------------------+---------+--------\r\n\r\nThese distance tariffs, however, as already explained in our chapter\r\non Classification, need to be supplemented by additional details in\r\norder to bring into relief the relative amount of the charge. So far\r\nas these figures go, it will be observed that for a distance about two\r\nand one-half times as great as from Chicago to New York or the Gulf of\r\nMexico, the rates to San Francisco are very much higher in proportion.\r\n\r\nThe unrest among shippers in far western territory is not due to\r\nthe relatively high tariffs in force. It arises primarily from the\r\nnullification of the distance principle in rates. And, in the second\r\nplace, it hinges upon the relation between carload ratings and the\r\ndevelopment of local jobbing business. The primary factor in the\r\nmaking of rates to the coast has always been the existence of water\r\ncompetition, either by way of Cape Horn or the Isthmus of Panama.[464]\r\nThe facilities for cheap transportation over these routes have\r\ncompelled the all-rail lines to make low through rates which would\r\nenable them to secure a portion of the business. Inasmuch, also, as\r\nmost of the competition of the steamships over these very long routes\r\ninvolves shipments in large quantity, competition with the railroads\r\nhas mainly been felt in making rates by the carload. The result has\r\nbeen the existence for many years of a special transcontinental tariff,\r\nmore or less uniformly adopted by all the roads, which consists in the\r\nmain of commodity rates for carload shipments, the scale of these rates\r\nbeing sufficiently low to meet steamship competition as above described.\r\n\r\nThis simple situation has been complicated by the fact that all of the\r\ntranscontinental lines, except the Southern Pacific with its eastern\r\nterminus at New Orleans, have had a particular interest in building up\r\nboth manufacturing and jobbing business at their eastern terminals at\r\nChicago or Missouri river points. For such a policy enabled them to\r\nsecure the entire charge for the transportation of commodities to the\r\nPacific coast, without the necessity of a pro-rating division, as when\r\ngoods are hauled from the Atlantic seaboard cities. The situation then\r\nresolved itself practically into a competition of markets. Chicago, St.\r\nLouis, and St. Paul were pitted against New York, Philadelphia, and\r\nother Atlantic ports in rivalry for the trade of the Pacific coast. In\r\norder to benefit the cities in which they had a peculiar interest, the\r\nall-rail lines, therefore, gradually introduced what is known as the\r\nsystem of \"postage-stamp rates.\"[465] That is to say, they gradually\r\nextended to one city after another east of the Mississippi river, the\r\nsame rates to the Pacific coast as were enjoyed by the seaboard cities.\r\nAs a consequence, for some years every city east of the Mississippi\r\nhas been able to ship goods to San Francisco at the same rate which is\r\npaid from Boston and New York, which may be more than a thousand miles\r\nfarther away.\r\n\r\nThis system is justified in theory, even for rates from Chicago and\r\nSt. Louis, as due to water competition; and it has been said that\r\ncommodities are sometimes shipped from as far inland as this to the\r\nAtlantic seaboard, and thence to San Francisco by water. The latest\r\nphase of the controversy reveals the weakness of this argument. The\r\ninland cities, such as Chicago and St. Louis, having been accorded the\r\nsame rate to San Francisco as New York and Philadelphia, demand lower\r\nrates than the Atlantic cities in proportion to their relative nearness\r\nto San Francisco. In other words, they demand that the rates, instead\r\nof being made upon the \"postage-stamp basis\"--absolutely the same from\r\nall cities, however remote--shall be graded. This would give Chicago,\r\nSt. Louis, and St. Paul an advantage in laying down manufactures or\r\nin distributing products secondarily, in competition with the older\r\ncentres at the East. To this policy the jobbing interests of the\r\nPacific coast strenuously object. From their point of view, any grading\r\nof rates will enable the western cities to compete with them directly\r\nin local distributive business. They do not object to the low rates\r\nfrom the eastern seaboard, nor would it avail to do so because the\r\nnatural conditions of water competition are beyond control. Moreover,\r\nthe low rates from Atlantic points are all, as above said, on carload\r\nlots, and such low carload rates operate distinctly to the advantage\r\nof the Pacific coast jobber, enabling him to obtain goods in wholesale\r\nlots, and then to break bulk in order to distribute them up and down\r\nthe coast.\r\n\r\nThe intimate relationship between the carload question and the grading\r\nof rates to interior centres, is plain from the foregoing paragraph.\r\nViewed by itself alone, the carload question is not dissimilar to\r\nthat presented in the southern states. Rivalry between jobbers in the\r\nEast and provincial middlemen in a little developed territory is in\r\nevidence in either case. The St. Louis Business Men's League case best\r\nexemplifies this issue.[466]\r\n\r\nTrade interests in this interior city wished to abolish all\r\ndistinction between carload and less-than-carload lots, for the patent\r\npurpose of enabling them to sell direct throughout the Pacific coast\r\nterritory in competition with San Francisco jobbers. The latter, on\r\nthe other hand, demanded that all less-than-carload ratings should be\r\nabolished on transcontinental shipments; so that they might purchase\r\ntheir goods by the carload and resell them in parcels. The Commission,\r\nafter fully weighing the evidence, decided that, so far as carload\r\ndifferentials were concerned, the existing scheme in 1902 was not\r\nabnormal as compared with other portions of the country. On the other\r\naspects of the matter, such as the relativity of rates to Rocky\r\nmountain and Pacific terminal points, no ruling was made. But the\r\ndissenting opinion upon this point is significant, as we shall see, in\r\nthat it put forth the suggestion of a scheme of rates graded according\r\nto distance,--a plan ten years later to be enforced by the Commission\r\nunder its amplified powers at law.\r\n\r\nThe welfare of the entire Rocky mountain belt of population, and\r\nparticularly its commercial centres, constitutes a second phase of\r\nthe problem of transcontinental rates.[467] The whole chain of cities\r\nfrom Spokane on the north to the Mexican border has been long and\r\nvitally interested in this matter. Rates to these cities, elsewhere\r\ndescribed,[468] as well as from these cities out in either direction,\r\nare very much higher than the rates for longer distances through\r\nthem and beyond. Thus, for instance, in the case of Pueblo, it has\r\nbeen shown that bar iron was hauled 2,400 miles from Chicago to San\r\nFrancisco, for fifty cents per one hundred pounds, and rails were\r\nhauled the same distance for sixty cents; while for the haul from\r\nPueblo, Colorado, to San Francisco, only 1,500 miles, the rate on both\r\ncommodities was $1.60. Cotton piece goods were shipped from Boston to\r\nOmaha for fifty-two cents per one hundred pounds, with the added rate\r\non to Denver of $1.25, giving an aggregate of $1.77. In face of this,\r\nthe rate through Denver to California is only one dollar. The railways'\r\ndefence for this situation was that the low through rates were\r\ncompelled by water competition. But it is certainly difficult on this\r\nground to justify lower rates to Missouri river points than to Denver\r\nor Salt Lake City. In other words, as urged in our chapter on local\r\ndiscrimination,[469] having once recognized the principle of blanket\r\nrates as far west as Kansas City, there seemed to be no reason why the\r\nlimit should not be pushed further west. All of these allied cases,\r\nhowever, were left unsettled for years, owing to the lack of power on\r\nthe part of the Interstate Commerce Commission to enforce its decisions\r\nunder the law as then interpreted. With the new legislation since 1906,\r\nas will be shown,[470] a permanent and just solution of the matter is\r\npromised at last.\r\n\r\nThe relations between the Canadian railways and the transcontinental\r\nlines in the United States were for many years unsatisfactory; and were\r\noftentimes a source of serious disturbance in the matter of rates. The\r\nCanadian Pacific claimed, and was in fact accorded for some years, a\r\ndifferential or a lower rate, in order to offset its disability in the\r\nmatter of distance, extra-territoriality, etc. Thus, for instance, in\r\n1888 the Canadian Pacific was allowed to quote rates thirty cents per\r\none hundred pounds below those by the standard lines. The rates were\r\nafterwards increased on first-class traffic. The other roads refused,\r\nafter a time, to continue differentials at this figure, and after\r\na year the differential was reduced to twenty-eight cents from the\r\nAtlantic seaboard. The question was bitterly contested after that until\r\n1892, when all agreements were abandoned.\r\n\r\nSince that time the Canadian Pacific has acted independently, taking,\r\nas a rule, rates about ten per cent. less than its competitors in\r\nAmerican territory. The whole question was submitted to arbitration\r\nin 1898, and by a divided opinion two out of three of the arbitrators\r\ndecided that the Canadian Pacific Railway was not, nor should it\r\nbe, entitled to a differential under the rates made by the United\r\nStates lines.[471] The intricacy of the question is indicated by the\r\nnon-concurrence in this conclusion of so well recognized an authority\r\nas J. W. Midgley. The railroads concerned having all agreed to\r\nacquiesce in this decision, the situation has been far more harmonious\r\nin this respect than for many years previous.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA difficulty often arises in connection with the interruption of\r\na shipment of goods in order to subject it to some simple process\r\nof manufacture. Shall the entire journey from producer to consumer\r\nbe considered as a unit in determination of the rate; or shall the\r\ntwo parts, before and after the change of form by manufacture, be\r\nconsidered as separate and distinct in this regard? This problem arises\r\nin connection with the so-called \"milling-in-transit\" system for\r\ngrain.[472] Logs likewise may be stopped at some convenient point en\r\nroute for cutting into lumber.[473] Cattle or hogs must sometimes be\r\nstopped on the way to market in order to fatten or otherwise prepare\r\nthem for sale;[474] structural iron may be halted for the purpose of\r\nfitting, shearing, or punching;[475] transit privileges on wool or\r\nconcentration points for other commodities may be involved;[476] or\r\nother goods may be substituted at an intermediate point.[477] And then,\r\nfinally, there are the so-called \"floating cotton\" cases.[478] The\r\nprinciple at bottom is practically the same in all of these sets of\r\ncases. It may be worth while briefly to consider two of them.\r\n\r\nThe \"milling in transit\" system is simply that of according to grain\r\nwhich is unloaded and milled at an intermediate point, the low through\r\nrate from the point of origin to that of consumption. Thus, for\r\ninstance, wheat grown in North Dakota may be unloaded and ground into\r\nflour at Minneapolis and thence shipped to New York at the through\r\nrate from its point of origin to New York. Oftentimes a very small\r\ncharge, as, for instance, one cent per one hundred pounds, is made for\r\nthe privilege. This system prevails throughout the southern states\r\nalso. Grain is brought, for instance, from Kansas City to Nashville or\r\nBirmingham, milled there, and shipped farther south for consumption.\r\nThe rate charged is based upon the entire haul from Kansas City to\r\nthe local point where the flour is consumed. Obviously this system\r\nstimulates very greatly the development of the milling industry at\r\nintermediate points. It is opposed correspondingly by the large cities\r\nwhich otherwise enjoy special privileges in the matter of low rates.\r\n\r\nPrecisely the same principle is involved in what are known as \"floating\r\ncotton\" rates. In this case the system has developed of permitting\r\ncotton to be unloaded in transit and compressed at an intermediate\r\npoint, it being thereafter reshipped to the point of destination at a\r\nthrough rate from its point of origin. Thus, for example, cotton may be\r\nhauled twenty to thirty miles to one of the larger towns. There it is\r\nunloaded, sorted and compressed, reloaded, and sent on as if it had not\r\nbeen interfered with at all. Obviously one rate for the entire shipment\r\nis much less than the local rate into the town--which is always very\r\nhigh--plus a second rate from that town on to destination. The system\r\nin respect to cotton has developed even further than that of milling\r\nin transit of grain; for in the latter case the grain must be unloaded\r\nat some point on the line to destination; whereas in the case of\r\ncotton it may, under rulings of the Interstate Commerce Commission,\r\nbe actually hauled _away_ from its ultimate destination a number of\r\nmiles and then reshipped back over the same line though at a lower rate\r\nthan it could otherwise have enjoyed. Thus, in a leading case decided\r\nin 1899 it was held by the Interstate Commerce Commission that cotton\r\ncould be hauled from Gattman, Mississippi, forty-one miles northwest to\r\nTupelo, compressed there, and then hauled back again through Gattman\r\nand Birmingham to New Orleans.\r\n\r\nImportant centres, such as Memphis, which formerly enjoyed almost a\r\nmonopoly of the compressing business, have strenuously opposed the\r\ndevelopment of this system. On the other hand, it offers a distinct\r\nadvantage to the grower, because in place of selling the cotton\r\nthrough cotton factors at Memphis or other centres, it may be sorted\r\nand compressed at local stations. By this means much expense in the\r\nmatter of drayage, handling and commissions is saved. This system is\r\nparticularly advantageous because it tends to break up the pernicious\r\nbasing point system, which tends to centralize all business at a few\r\nimportant points in the southern states. Almost a complete revolution\r\nin the matter of handling cotton has been effected during the last\r\nfew years by the growth of this practice. Not only has the floating\r\ncotton system developed further than that of milling in transit by\r\naccording the right of shipping even backward, away from the ultimate\r\ndestination; it has also permitted of liberality in the handling of the\r\nproduct itself. It has been held that it is not even necessary for the\r\nsame cotton to be reshipped from the point of compression. A carload\r\nstarted from the initial point for Boston, for example, may never\r\nreach there, other cotton being substituted for it. The destination\r\nof the car may be, and frequently is, changed. A few dozen grades\r\nof cotton being on the market, the original shipment into the point\r\nof compression may be entirely resorted and distributed to a dozen\r\ndifferent points. Even the ownership of the cotton may change while it\r\nis in transit. Nevertheless, the system has been held as valid under\r\nthe law, and its beneficial effects during the last few years have\r\nbeen observable, especially in the southern states. Of late the danger\r\nlurking in these systems of gross personal favoritism, have led to\r\ntheir careful examination in a number of cases. What the final policy\r\nregarding them is to be, cannot at this writing be affirmed.[479]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA problem of considerable difficulty, involving the relative shares\r\nof the various seaports in American export business, has occupied the\r\nattention of experts for more than a generation; and at this present\r\nwriting, although before the Interstate Commerce Commission for the\r\nthird time, seems to be almost as far from a satisfactory solution as\r\never.[480] It originated at the time of the rate wars in 1876. The\r\nfirst agreement between all the trunk lines concerning it was entered\r\ninto in the following year. By this an attempt was made to equalize\r\nthe aggregate cost of ocean and rail transportation between competing\r\npoints in the West and all foreign and domestic points reached through\r\nBaltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston. Under this agreement,\r\nBaltimore was allowed a rate of three cents below the rate from Chicago\r\nto New York; Philadelphia enjoyed a concession of two cents; while\r\nBoston had its rate fixed at a certain percentage of the Chicago-New\r\nYork figure. There was considerable dissatisfaction expressed at\r\nvarious times with these differentials, and the whole matter was\r\nsubmitted to arbitration in 1882. The commercial interests of New York,\r\nas well as of the railroads centering in that city, have complained\r\nbitterly that these differences, once adjusted upon a very much higher\r\nscale of rates than at present, have become increasingly burdensome\r\nnow that the Chicago-New York rate is perhaps not more than a third\r\nor a quarter of what it formerly was, while the differential has\r\nremained at a fixed figure. The recent decline of the export commerce\r\nof New York is, in fact, ascribed in a large measure to the operation\r\nof these differentials; and a leading case before the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission, instituted by the Produce Exchange of New York,\r\nendeavored to secure their abolition. The Commission held, however,\r\nthat the differentials--recognized by the Joint Traffic Association\r\nof 1896--were legitimately based upon competitive relations of the\r\ncarriers; and that consequently no unlawful preference or advantage had\r\nbeen accorded to the cities competing with New York for export business.\r\n\r\nThe result of pressure for a larger division of export business,\r\nparticularly from Boston, led, in 1899, to a reduction by one-half of\r\nthe differentials. The matter was finally submitted for arbitration\r\nto the Interstate Commerce Commission, which very fully examined\r\nthe question and rendered a decision in 1905.[481] By this decision\r\nrates _via_ Philadelphia on traffic for export were to be one cent\r\nless than by way of New York, while to Baltimore they were to be two\r\ncents less. This arrangement still left Boston subject to its former\r\nsubstantial disability. It was contended that the original purpose\r\nof the differentials, namely, equilibration of rates from western\r\ncentres of production through the various ports to Liverpool, had been\r\npractically nullified. For a time the phenomenal development of the\r\nGulf exports diverted attention, forcing all the Atlantic seaports to\r\nmake common cause against their southern rivals.[482] But the passing\r\nof this danger once more revived interest in the struggle between the\r\nAtlantic cities. Opportunity for the collection of full data under\r\nthe strengthened Federal law in 1906, made it possible to reopen the\r\ncase in 1912 before the Interstate Commerce Commission. But, in the\r\nmeantime, both in 1909 and 1911, after an interval of twenty years,\r\ntrunk line rate wars threatened to break out for the protection of\r\nBoston against its rivals. The latest decision by the Commission,\r\njust handed down,[483] still fails to satisfy Boston. No differential\r\nrate on export grain on the ground of distance as against New York is\r\nconceded; but those already in effect at Philadelphia and Baltimore\r\nare sanctioned. What the effect will be, remains for the future to\r\ndetermine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe principle involved in the so-called import and export cases[484] is\r\nthat of the reasonableness of charging lower rates on goods originally\r\nshipped from or destined to domestic points, than are charged for\r\nsimilar goods, over the same lines and for the same distances, when\r\nbrought from or destined to foreign countries. Thus, for instance, in\r\nthe case of cotton cloth shipped by way of Pacific ports to the Orient,\r\nthe practice is not uncommon of charging a less rate to San Francisco\r\nfor the transportation of goods ultimately destined for export, than is\r\ncharged on similar goods which are to be unloaded for consumption at\r\nSan Francisco or other California points. Or, reversing the case, this\r\nquestion touches the reasonableness of transporting goods from New York\r\nto Chicago at a lower rate, if they have been brought in from Europe,\r\nthan is charged for similar service in the case of goods that have\r\noriginated at or near New York. Cases of this description have become\r\nincreasingly frequent during the last twenty years. The first and most\r\nimportant one, upon which both the Interstate Commerce Commission and\r\nthe United States Supreme Court have passed, originated in proceedings\r\nbefore the Interstate Commerce Commission, brought by the New York\r\nBoard of Trade of Transportation against the Pennsylvania and other\r\nrailroad companies. The case practically raised the general question\r\nwhether, in the carriage of goods from American seaports, carriers\r\nsubject to the act could lawfully charge less for the transportation of\r\nimported than of domestic traffic of like kind to the same destination.\r\nThe Commission, after careful examination, held that such differences\r\nin rates constituted discrimination as against the domestic shipper.\r\nAccording to its view, the circumstances and conditions pertaining to\r\nthe carriage of freight from a foreign port to the United States could\r\nnot be considered as creating the dissimilarity of conditions which\r\nalone would justify a different rate for like service in the two cases.\r\nThe Commission held that:\r\n\r\n    \"One paramount purpose of the act to regulate commerce,\r\n    manifest in all its conditions, is to give to all dealers and\r\n    shippers the same rates for similar services rendered by the\r\n    carrier in transporting similar freight over its line. Now, it\r\n    is apparent from the evidence in this case that many American\r\n    manufacturers, dealers, and localities, in almost every line\r\n    of manufacture and business, are the competitors of foreign\r\n    manufacturers, dealers, and localities for supplying the\r\n    wants of American consumers at interior places in the United\r\n    States, and that under domestic bills of lading they seek to\r\n    require from American carriers like service as their foreign\r\n    competitors.... The act to regulate commerce secures them this\r\n    right. To deprive them of it by any course of transportation\r\n    business or device is to violate the statute.\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission thereupon ordered the carriers to cease and desist\r\nfrom making such discrimination. This order, while obeyed by a number\r\nof carriers, was disregarded by the Texas and Pacific Railway, which\r\noperated an import line from New Orleans to San Francisco. Upon\r\napplication by the Commission this case was carried to the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States for final adjudication. The Supreme\r\nCourt decided that the interpretation of the law by the Commission\r\nwas defective, although three members of the court, including the\r\nChief Justice, dissented from this opinion. As an illustration of\r\nthe discrimination which existed in this case it appeared that the\r\ndomestic rate on books, buttons, carpets, etc., from New Orleans to San\r\nFrancisco was $2.88 per one hundred pounds, while the total through\r\ncharge on the same articles from Liverpool to San Francisco was only\r\n$1.07. The Supreme Court distinctly refrained from an opinion as to the\r\nreasonableness of these rates, and contented itself with passing upon\r\nthe propriety of any difference in rates whatever. It held that the\r\ncontention of the railroads was sound, namely, that all circumstances\r\nand conditions, whether within the United States or having regard for\r\nocean rates and foreign competitive conditions, must be considered. In\r\nother words, they recognized the validity of the claim of the railroads\r\nthat this import traffic must be taken at an extremely low rate if at\r\nall, since otherwise the goods would go by water around Cape Horn,\r\nor by another route. On the basis of such reasoning it would appear\r\nthat any contribution from low import rates to the fixed charges of\r\nthe railroad would enable that road to transport its domestic traffic\r\nat a lower rate than it otherwise might. What, however, the majority\r\nof the court did not add, although it was developed by the dissenting\r\njustices, was the fact that these conditions might exclude domestic\r\npurchasers entirely from certain markets, giving them over to importers\r\nwho could control the market by reason of the low rates accorded. Since\r\nthis decision in 1896 the railroads have still further developed this\r\nsystem of discrimination. The only safeguard for the domestic producer\r\nmust lie, obviously, in some decision by a competent tribunal as to\r\nthe amount of such differences which may reasonably exist. The Supreme\r\nCourt has upheld their validity as a system, but it still remains for\r\nthe amount of such difference which may be deemed reasonable, to be\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nIdentical in principle with the above described case, although\r\npresenting reversed conditions, are the so-called export rate cases.\r\nThese have to do mainly with the rates charged on products for domestic\r\nconsumption as against like products for export. As an illustration\r\nof the extent of such differences, it was clearly shown before the\r\nIndustrial Commission that at times the freight rate on wheat from\r\nKansas City to Galveston was twenty-seven cents per one hundred pounds\r\nif for domestic consumption, while the proportion of an export rate\r\nfor a similar service was ten cents.[485] The rate on wheat from the\r\nMississippi river to New York for domestic consumption was at times\r\ntwenty or twenty-one cents per one hundred pounds, while for the same\r\nservice when the goods were to be exported, the rate would be thirteen\r\ncents per one hundred pounds. This system of stimulating foreign\r\nbusiness by discriminatingly low rates seems to have attained large\r\nproportions only since 1897. The Interstate Commerce Commission took\r\ncognizance of the system in a decision rendered in 1899.[486] It was\r\nenabled to do so by virtue of the Import Rate decision above cited,\r\nwhereby the United States Supreme Court authorized it to consider not\r\nonly circumstances and conditions within the United States, but also\r\nthose relating to ocean transport and foreign competition.\r\n\r\nThe railroads justify their action on the ground that only by making\r\nsuch concessions in export rates could they lay down grain in foreign\r\nmarkets in competition with other parts of the world. On the other\r\nhand, it was not made clear why such competition from foreign markets\r\nhad become any more acute in the last few years than prior to that\r\ntime. There appears to be much force in the argument of many shippers,\r\nand also of some railroad men, that this anomalous condition of rates\r\nwas due, not so much to the keenness of foreign competition, as to the\r\nrivalry among the American carriers themselves. In other words, it\r\nwas said that the competition between the Gulf ports and the Atlantic\r\nports was responsible for the abnormally low rates on export business.\r\nIn line with this argument would seem to be the fact that it is the\r\nrates upon wheat and not upon flour for export, which have decreased\r\nmore than in proportion to the decrease upon similar commodities for\r\ndomestic consumption. The passing of the acutest phase of competition\r\nfrom the Gulf ports since 1906, has rendered these questions of lesser\r\ninterest of late years. They may at any time be revived, but seem\r\nunlikely to regain the importance which they formerly assumed.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[436] Among the best references on the subject are the following:\r\nMcPherson, Railway Freight Rates, pp. 85-92, especially on the\r\nVirginia-Carolina cities; Rep.

In respect of freight rates this\r\nmovement is commonly judged in either of two ways; by comparison of\r\nactual rates charged for specified service between given points through\r\na series of years; or, secondly, by means of what is called the revenue\r\nper ton mile. Considering first the use of this latter index, the\r\ncourse of events is shown by means of the diagram opposite the next\r\npage, covering the period between 1867 and 1910. But before conclusions\r\nmay safely be drawn from this showing, it is imperative that the true\r\nsignificance of revenue per ton mile statistics should be set forth.\r\nFor a generation, and particularly in connection with the Roosevelt\r\nlegislation in 1906, volumes of written and oral evidence upon moot\r\nquestions were based upon such figures. Specious and misleading\r\nreasoning upon a public question was perhaps never more common in the\r\ncourse of our history.[488] It is most important to understand clearly\r\nthe real significance of this common statistical unit. We shall then,\r\nonly, be in position to interpret the diagram properly.\r\n\r\nThe revenue per ton mile for a given road, or for the railway system of\r\nthe United States, is computed by dividing the total freight revenue\r\nfor that service, whatever it may be, by the number representing the\r\namount of freight in tons hauled one mile. Thus, for example, if the\r\ntotal freight revenue of a system of roads be $900,000,000, this\r\nhaving been received as compensation for hauling an equivalent of\r\n90,000,000,000 tons of freight one mile, the compensation actually\r\nreceived for each ton hauled one mile is obviously one cent. All that\r\nis necessary in order to compute the average revenue per ton mile,\r\nthen, is to know the total freight revenue and the amount of ton\r\nmileage service. Computed in this way the average revenue per ton per\r\nmile for the railways of the United States in 1867 was 1.92 cents.\r\nFrom this level a decline took place in 1890 to 0.941 cents--that is\r\nto say, the average amount received for each ton of freight hauled\r\none mile had declined about one half. Since about 1897 there has been\r\nno considerable change, the corresponding figure for 1911 being 0.757\r\ncents. In other words, at the present time the carriers of the United\r\nStates receive about three-fourths of a cent for each ton-mile service.\r\nFrom a revenue point of view this unit may seem insignificant in\r\namount; but it should be borne in mind, of course, that it is applied\r\nto an immense volume of traffic. Even the slight increase between 1900\r\nand the present time, if applied to the volume of traffic now existing,\r\nwould make a difference in freight revenue for the entire railway\r\nsystem of the United States of approximately $61,000,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOVEMENT OF FREIGHT RATES 1867-1970]\r\n\r\nMeasurement of the course of freight rates by means of revenue per\r\nton mile possesses one great advantage. It measures the _actual_\r\nreturn received by the railway without regard to the published tariff,\r\nshowing accurately, therefore, the degree to which any departures\r\nfrom the published rates take place. For this reason the foregoing\r\ndiagram probably under-indicates the extent, relatively, of the decline\r\nbefore 1900. For it is indubitable that the published rates have been\r\nvery much more nearly observed with the passage of time during this\r\ndecade.[489] On the other hand, revenue per ton mile, as thus used\r\nfor general purposes, is open to a number of very serious objections.\r\nObviously, like any statistical average it fails to represent the\r\nactual payment for any given service. But its disadvantages are more\r\ndeeply seated than this. Entirely irrespective of any change in the\r\nlevel of rates, revenue per ton mile is affected fundamentally by three\r\ndistinct sets of conditions. It varies according to the nature of the\r\ntraffic, whether high grade or low; it is affected by the length of the\r\nhaul and the proportion of local as distinct from through business; and\r\nit is modified profoundly according to the volume of traffic handled.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to the consideration of the above mentioned factors,\r\nattention may be directed to the following table, which gives the\r\nextreme range of ton-mile revenue for a number of different railways\r\narranged in groups according to the nature of their business.\r\n\r\nEach group is graded, moreover, within itself according to the\r\nrevenue per ton mile. From this showing it appears that for 1910\r\nthe range above and below the average for the United States is\r\nconsiderable--being upwards of three times as great for the New Haven\r\nsystem as for the Chesapeake & Ohio, which comes at the foot of the\r\nlist. It will now be in order to explain the reasons for these wide\r\nvariations, which are by no means, as is customarily assumed in public\r\ndiscussion, conditioned even primarily by the level or reasonableness\r\nof the freight rates charged.

This is most clearly shown by comparison in the table between the\r\ngroup of coal and ore roads and the New England systems. The revenue\r\nper unit of service on a road whose traffic is largely of low grade\r\nmost necessarily be low. Probably the lowest average ever reported\r\nin the United States was for the Chesapeake & Ohio in 1899--the low\r\npoint in the general movement of freight rates--when its ton-mile\r\nrevenue touched O.362 cents. Whenever the business of a carrier\r\nconsists largely of coal, grain, lumber or other low-grade commodities\r\non which the freight charges must necessarily be exceedingly low in\r\norder that the freight shall move at all, the revenue per ton mile\r\nmust consequently stand at a low figure. Bald comparison of any such\r\nrevenue with a corresponding figure for high-grade roads is obviously\r\nmisleading and fallacious. It does not mean that the latter necessarily\r\ncharges more for the same service; but its higher revenue per ton of\r\nfreight moved one mile may be, and very likely is, merely due to the\r\nfact that much of its tonnage is capable of bearing higher charges.\r\nFrom this circumstance it also follows that comparisons from year to\r\nyear either for single roads or for the entire railway net, must be\r\nmade in the light of variations in the proportion of high and low grade\r\ntonnage. The trend seems to have been steadily downward in this regard\r\nyear by year. A steady increase, relatively, in the volume of low-grade\r\ntraffic has long been under way.[490]\r\n\r\nThe development of the last twenty years in the United States has\r\ncertainly been in favor of a great increase in low-grade traffic.\r\nThis is shown by the following table, giving the per cent. of tonnage\r\nin various classes upon the trunk lines from New York to and beyond\r\nChicago.\r\n\r\n         PER CENT.

Prior to 1886\r\nno considerable number of articles were permanently assigned to the\r\nfifth and sixth classes; they embraced usually a few commodities which\r\nhad been assigned a special rate.\" Further consideration of this table\r\nshows that first-class freight, forming thirty per cent. of the tonnage\r\nin 1878, declined to less than twenty per cent. in 1892; while at the\r\nsame time sixth-class freight ran up from nothing to 43.4 per cent.\r\nin 1892. Fourth-class freight declined during the same period from\r\n57.9 to 10.4 per cent. These figures simply mean that a great deal of\r\ntraffic is now carried upon American railways for long distances which\r\na generation ago it was believed could not be profitably moved at all.\r\nThe utility of the railway service, once supposedly confined entirely\r\nto freight of the higher classes, has been gradually extended until\r\ntoday there is no commodity too cheap to be handled with the improved\r\nfacilities. This vast increase in the amount of low-grade traffic is\r\nundoubtedly responsible to some degree for the apparent decline of\r\nfreight rates so often instanced. Fortunately upon this point we have\r\nthe specific testimony of traffic managers of long experience. On\r\nthe other hand, in justice to the railways it must be admitted that\r\nthe proportion of local business at high rates, which would tend to\r\nincrease the average revenue per ton mile, has steadily increased\r\nwith the growth of the country; and, moreover, as has already been\r\nshown, in times of exceptional prosperity the movement of high-grade\r\nfreight has increased in more than its due proportion.[492] Nor are\r\nthese facts adduced in criticism of American railway policy. They are\r\nsimply intended to draw attention to the fact that, while changes of\r\nfreight rates have undoubtedly been considerable, they have not been\r\nas great as is oftentimes plausibly stated. As for comparisons with\r\nforeign countries, they are practically invalidated by the difference\r\nin local conditions, as, for instance, in England where local delivery\r\nis involved. In the United States such service is charged in addition,\r\neither as drayage or express.\r\n\r\nThe increased diversification in the freight tonnage of American\r\nrailways, always in the direction of a larger proportion of traffic\r\nfrom general business rather than from the movement of staple\r\ncommodities, is also of great fiscal significance. It means not only\r\nmore business, but better and more permanent traffic. The difference,\r\nmoreover, between the charge which high-grade freight, such as\r\nmerchandise, will bear by comparison with the highest rate upon grain\r\nor coal, is much greater than any difference in the cost of service.\r\nThe profit, therefore, attendant upon the movement of traffic other\r\nthan low-grade commodities is strikingly great; although, of course,\r\nprofitableness is a question of relativity between operating cost and\r\nrevenue. Heavy train loads of coal at 4 mills per ton mile may be\r\nbetter business than merchandise in light carloads at a rate five times\r\nas high. At all events the tendency toward higher grade tonnage has\r\nbeen notable, especially since 1900. Many western roads and even the\r\ntrunk lines, formerly dependent in a great measure upon the movement\r\nof crops, are now affected only indirectly in this regard, by reason\r\nof their influence upon general business. The growing diversification\r\nof traffic because of its financial importance merits more concrete\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\nThe Lake Shore & Michigan Southern, during the calendar year 1900,\r\nincreased its freight traffic by 1,760,000 tons. Of this only 194,000\r\ntons were specified as products of agriculture and animals, while\r\nproducts of the forests actually declined by 84,000 tons. In other\r\nwords, nearly all of this phenomenal increase in business in 1900\r\nwas due to the movement of manufactures, minerals and merchandise.\r\nA comparison made for the last three decades makes this point still\r\nmore clear. Since 1880 there has been very little increase in\r\nagricultural tonnage upon this trunk line, with an actual decrease in\r\nthe movement of grain. This, perhaps, may be in part explained by the\r\ngreat development of grain traffic upon the lakes, which, of course,\r\nabsorbs much business formerly carried by this road. In other words,\r\nfarm products and provisions transported by the Lake Shore rose from\r\n3,465,000 tons in 1880 to only 3,843,000 tons in 1900. The movement\r\nof petroleum and lumber actually decreased, owing to the construction\r\nof pipe lines and the clearing of the forests. On the other hand,\r\nmanufactures and merchandise increased threefold in volume, rising from\r\n3,754,000 tons in 1880 to 14,932,000 tons in 1900. Whereas agricultural\r\nproducts in 1880 formed over forty per cent. of the traffic upon the\r\nLake Shore, they constituted in 1900 less than twenty per cent. Much\r\nthe same tendency is manifested by other routes. Thus for the fiscal\r\nyear 1901, the Chesapeake & Ohio reported substantial decreases in the\r\nactual tonnage of flour, grain, sand, stone, iron, etc.; but a largely\r\naugmented movement of general merchandise of the higher classes. Many\r\nof the soft-coal roads, such as the Cleveland, Lorain & Wheeling,\r\nwhich used to carry nearly two-thirds of their tonnage in the form of\r\ncoal, now carry less than forty per cent. A feature of importance in\r\nthe great prosperity of the anthracite coal roads has been a steady\r\nincrease in the volume of their general traffic as distinct from\r\ncoal tonnage. All over the country, in short, the steady growth of\r\npopulation and the decline in the proportion of grain for export is\r\nreducing, relatively, the importance of low-grade tonnage, supplanting\r\nit by a movement of supplies and merchandise in the contrary direction.\r\n\r\nThe classification of tonnage for the United States, as a whole and by\r\nmain divisions, is shown by the following excerpt from _Statistics of\r\nRailroads for 1909_:\r\n\r\n                        Freight Traffic Movement\r\n\r\n  -------------------+------------------+------------------\r\n                     | United States    |   Trunk Line\r\n                     |                  |   Territory\r\n  Class of           +-----------+------+-----------+------\r\n  commodity          | Tonnage   | Per  |  Tonnage  | Per\r\n                     | _Tons_    | Cent |  _Tons_   | Cent\r\n  -------------------+-----------+------+-----------+------\r\n  Products of        |           |      |           |\r\n  agriculture        | 73,600,000|  8.92| 19,000,000|  4.65\r\n  Products of        |           |      |           |\r\n  animals            | 20,600,000|  2.49|  7,600,000|  1.86\r\n  Products of        |           |      |           |\r\n  mines              |459,500,000| 55.60|256,200,000| 62.71\r\n  Products of        |           |      |           |\r\n  forests            | 97,100,000| 11.75| 21,500,000|  5.28\r\n  Manufactures       |108,600,000| 13.15| 70,000,000| 17.15\r\n  Merchandise        | 33,900,000|  4.11| 13,500,000|  3.31\r\n  Miscellaneous      | 32,800,000|  3.98| 20,500,000|  5.04\r\n  -------------------+-----------+------+-----------+------\r\n  Grand total        |826,400,000|100.00|408,600,000|100.00\r\n  -------------------+-----------+------+-----------+------\r\n\r\n  -------------------+-----------+------+------------------\r\n                     |     Southern     |    Western\r\n                     |     Territory    |    Territory\r\n  Class of           +-----------+------+-----------+------\r\n  commodity          |  Tonnage  | Per  |  Tonnage  | Per\r\n                     |  _Tons_   | Cent |  _Tons_   | Cent\r\n  -------------------+-----------+------+-----------+------\r\n  Products of        |           |      |           |\r\n  agriculture        |  9,500,000|  7.92| 45,100,000| 15.18\r\n  Products of        |           |      |           |\r\n  animals            |  1,000,000|   .83| 11,900,000|  4.03\r\n  Products of        |           |      |           |\r\n  mines              | 63,000,000| 52.20|140,200,000| 47.22\r\n  Products of        |           |      |           |\r\n  forests            | 25,300,000| 20.95| 50,200,000| 16.92\r\n  Manufactures       | 13,300,000| 11.09| 25,100,000|  8.48\r\n  Merchandise        |  4,800,000|  3.98| 15,600,000|  5.26\r\n  Miscellaneous      |  3,600,000|  3.03|  8,600,000|  2.19\r\n  -------------------+-----------+------+-----------+------\r\n  Grand total        |120,700,000|100.00|297,000,000|100.00\r\n  -------------------+-----------+------+-----------+------\r\n\r\nConclusions from these figures are well worth noting. The importance,\r\nmeasured by traffic rather than revenue, of low-grade freight classed\r\nas products of mines, is notable. This forms more than half the\r\naggregate tonnage for the United States, and has appreciably increased\r\nwithin the last ten years. In 1910 it constituted almost two-thirds\r\nof the business in trunk line territory and almost one-half in the\r\nWest. Products of agriculture, on the other hand, even in western\r\nterritory, amount to less than one-fifth of the total tonnage. These\r\nfacts indicate clearly the diverse conditions under which railways\r\noperate in different parts of the country. The next table,[493]\r\nbesides incidentally throwing more light upon the relative tonnage of\r\nstaple commodities, will suffice to establish our main point--namely,\r\nthat the nature of the traffic vitally affects all ton mile revenue\r\nstatistics. It entirely, in fact, overshadows mere changes in the\r\ngeneral level of freight rates. Any argument concerning the movement\r\nof such charges, which fails to correct fully for this factor, may be\r\ndismissed at once as valueless.\r\n\r\n      Summary of Selected Commodities for the Year Ending June 30,\r\n                               1910[494]\r\n\r\n                                                            Average\r\n                                                            receipts per\r\n                                Ton-mileage   Revenue       ton per mile\r\n                  Freight       of freight    from freight  from freight\r\n                  carried in    carried in    carried in    carried in\r\n  Commodity       carload lots  carload lots  carload lots  carload lots\r\n                     _Tons_      _Ton miles_                   _Cents_\r\n\r\n  Grain             31,947,009   7,067,690,568  $44,553,330    0.630\r\n  Hay                5,856,185     954,623,830    9,731,590    1.019\r\n  Cotton             3,400,316     689,594,719   12,573,674    1.823\r\n  Live stock        10,754,108   2,449,310,036   29,802,514    1.217\r\n  Dressed meats      2,407,454     724,239,606    6,548,955     .904\r\n  Anthracite coal   28,202,577   5,104,428,347   30,083,630     .589\r\n  Bituminous coal  192,479,389  22,228,778,428  110,139,107     .495\r\n  Lumber            68,482,732  11,891,569,514   87,225,470     .734\r\n\r\nA second consideration in the interpretation of ton mile data, of\r\nequal importance with the nature of the traffic, is the length of the\r\nhaul and the proportion of local as distinct from through business.\r\nThis necessarily follows from the nature of a distance tariff. Only\r\non condition that the rate augmented in direct proportion to the\r\nincrease of distance, would the revenue per ton mile remain constant.\r\nThe diagram at page 108 is instructive in this connection. The\r\ncharges--denoted by the height of the curve at any given point--tend\r\nto grow much less rapidly than distance. In other words, the rate\r\ncurve approaches a parabolic form, until after a certain point it\r\nbecomes practically a flat rate, independent of distance. This fact of\r\nnecessity causes ton-mile revenue to decrease steadily with the length\r\nof the haul. For ton-mile revenue is but the ratio of the abscissa to\r\nthe ordinate of the curve at any given point; the former being the rate\r\ncharged, the latter the distance.\r\n\r\nIn practice, therefore, the longer the haul in general, the lower is\r\nthe revenue per ton mile.[495] This is clearly shown by comparison of\r\nthe two items for given roads, otherwise similarly circumstanced, in\r\nthe table already discussed on page 415.\r\n\r\nClosely akin to the length of haul in affecting ton-mile revenue,\r\nis the proportion of local traffic. This also is in practice vital.\r\nObviously it costs much more to handle local business, the terminal\r\nexpenses being far greater in proportion. And at the same time a larger\r\nproportion of the freight moves in small lots locally. This difference\r\nbetween revenue per ton mile for local business and through traffic\r\nis very great. On the Louisville & Nashville, for example, in 1886,\r\nit was 1.48 cents for the former, as against .99 cents for through\r\nbusiness.[496] The Illinois Central in 1900 reported an average revenue\r\nper ton mile on through freight of 0.48 cents, while for local freight\r\nthe corresponding figure was 1.17 cents, the average of both being\r\n0.56 cents. It is apparent, therefore, that any accurate determination\r\nof the level of charges in general must take account of such facts as\r\nthese.\r\n\r\nAny carrier like the Southern Pacific, the Chesapeake & Ohio or the\r\nErie, with relatively little local traffic and a business dependent\r\nlargely upon the long haul, will conduct transportation for a\r\nmaterially lower figure than roads in a densely settled territory.\r\nThis consideration was recently illustrated in Massachusetts\r\nexperience.[497] The Fitchburg Railroad, devoted to long distance,\r\nlow-grade business by the Hoosac tunnel route, was consolidated with\r\nthe Boston & Maine in 1900. Its revenue per ton mile was formerly .818\r\ncents based upon such traffic. When it was merged with the Boston &\r\nMaine,--considerably blessed as it is with local traffic,--the latter's\r\nton-mile revenue fell from 1.44 cents in 1900 to 1.158 cents in the\r\nfollowing year. There had been no change whatever in freight rates.\r\n\r\nA word may be interposed in this connection as to the peculiar movement\r\nof local as distinguished from through rates through a series of years.\r\nLocal charges have decreased relatively little, probably because of the\r\nabsence of competition in such cases. They have, moreover, decreased\r\nvery unevenly in different parts of the country. Apparently one of\r\nthe first and most beneficent results of the enactment of the Act to\r\nRegulate Commerce in 1887, was a reduction of local rates in various\r\nparts of the country, in order to bring the rate adjustment into\r\nconformity with the long and short haul clause. This was peculiarly\r\nthe case in the northeastern or trunk line territory. It does not seem\r\nto have occurred in the southern states, where the long and short\r\nhaul principle has never been accepted in its entirety. The most\r\ncomprehensive report upon the subject concludes that local rates have\r\nin various parts of the country, during the last quarter century,\r\nbeen reduced from ten to fifty per cent.[498] Returns from various\r\nrailway commissions interrogated by the Industrial Commission in 1900\r\nupon the subject showed highly variable results. From Mississippi it\r\nappeared that \"local freight rates in this state have been materially\r\nlowered in the last four years, especially in the lettered classes\";\r\nwhile in the adjoining state of Alabama \"local rates on freight have\r\ndecreased very little in the last five or six years, and have not\r\ndecreased in proportion to the decrease made in interstate rates.\" In\r\nNew England, comparison of actual freight rates did not indicate any\r\nvery considerable reduction, the absence of competition in this section\r\nbeing, perhaps, in part responsible for this result. A comparison of\r\npublished freight rates in southern territory, without making allowance\r\nfor departures from such tariffs, apparently showed a very much smaller\r\nreduction than in other parts of the country. It is also apparently\r\ntrue that the reduction of cotton rates in this section, while\r\nconsiderable, had been much less rapid than that of the rates upon\r\ngrain from Chicago to the seaboard in either direction. A few instances\r\nof an actual rise of local charges since 1900 may be cited.[499]\r\nBut the fact that competition has been substantially eliminated in\r\nconsequence of widespread consolidation since 1900, has rendered the\r\nmovement of local and through freight rates more nearly alike all over\r\nthe country than they were prior to that time.\r\n\r\nThe third consideration which must always be kept in mind in the\r\ninterpretation of revenue per ton mile is the volume of the traffic\r\nhandled. Any comparison of freight rates which is not made in the light\r\nof increase in the business transacted, is bound to be misleading.\r\nA reduction of cost of operation per unit, attending a growth in\r\nvolume, has already been fully described in connection with the theory\r\nof rates. And it is but natural that a reduction in the rate should\r\nfollow any lessening of cost. Moreover, a large volume of business\r\nusually implies a relatively greater amount of low-grade tonnage. In\r\norder to bring out this relationship the second column in the table on\r\npage 415 has been added. This permits a correlation between freight\r\ndensity--that is to say, ton miles per mile of line and revenue per\r\nunit of service. It will be noted that, in general, the revenue unit\r\nfalls as the volume of traffic, measured by freight density, rises.\r\nThis is strikingly shown by comparison of the groups of western and\r\ntranscontinental roads with those concerned mainly with the carriage\r\nof coal and ore. The soft coal Hocking Valley road with its enormous\r\ndensity and very low revenue per ton mile, affords an excellent\r\nexample. It is indubitable that the trunk lines and the coal roads are\r\nable to transact business for relatively low rates, not only because\r\ntheir tonnage is of low grade, long haul or both; but also because\r\nof its immense concentration per mile of line, permitting all of the\r\neconomies incident to large-scale operation. In this connection,\r\nhowever, it should be noted as a general principle, that oftentimes it\r\nis not the mere increase in the traffic of a particular sort which is\r\nsignificant; but rather the growth in the total volume of business of\r\nall kinds.[500]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing criticism of the use of revenue per ton mile as a means\r\nof showing the course of freight rates in general has been mainly\r\ndestructive. This figure, nevertheless, will in many cases be found\r\nhighly serviceable in the examination of particular rates. It may\r\nproperly be used to determine whether a given commodity is contributing\r\nits due proportion to the general budget of the carrier. Revenue per\r\nton mile can, of course, be computed for each particular service;\r\ninasmuch as both the income and the volume of that service are matters\r\nof independent record. The table on page 421 brings out this point.\r\nOr take a division of the Illinois Central for 1900. Its revenue per\r\nton mile was 0.136 cents on wheat, 0.79 cents on flour, 4.267 cents on\r\nsugar-cane, 0.309 cents on soft coal, 1.148 cents on stone and sand,\r\n2.238 cents on furniture, 3.165 cents on merchandise. On this basis\r\none may properly inquire as to whether under all the circumstances\r\nwheat, coal or merchandise are doing their part, in the light of the\r\nparticular expenses attached to their carriage, in maintaining the\r\ngeneral burden of indivisible costs. When copper yields a revenue per\r\nton mile of only 0.285 cents, the rate being only 1.6 per cent. of\r\nits market value, while on wheat for the same haul the corresponding\r\nunit of return is 0.4 cents per ton mile--equal to one-fifth of its\r\nworth--there is evidently a maladjustment favoring one commodity over\r\nanother.[501] In a number of recent cases questions of this sort\r\nhave been rather satisfactorily answered by resort to this unit of\r\nmeasurement.[502]\r\n\r\nThe curve of revenue per ton mile, as shown by diagram at the head\r\nof this chapter, certainly gives no indication of the considerable\r\nincrease of freight rates which has ensued since 1900. This follows\r\nfrom the fact that in at least two of the three respects, above\r\nmentioned, the trend of events, independent of any change in the level\r\nof freight rates, has operated to greatly dilute the revenue per ton\r\nmile. The growth of low-grade traffic and the immense augmentation in\r\ntonnage have both conspired to render this unit entirely useless for\r\npurposes of comparison year by year. The average length of haul alone\r\nseems to have remained much the same during the decade. Although the\r\ncurve does not show it, there has been a notable upward movement all\r\nalong the line, responsible, as we shall see, for much of the new\r\nFederal legislation. How may we, then, estimate the amount of these\r\nincreases? Under such circumstances, it is necessary to turn to the\r\nmovement of actual rates.[503] The course of these down to 1900 is best\r\nshown upon the same diagram above mentioned by means of the dotted\r\ncurve, entitled Actual Rate Index, the scale for which is given at the\r\nright. This rate index is simply the average of the actual published\r\nrates for a number of specific commodities between certain given\r\npoints. It differs in principle from the ton mileage revenue curve, in\r\nthat it concerns merely the _published_ rates, taking no account of\r\nrebates or departures from those rates in actual practice. A comparison\r\nof its course with that of the ton mileage curve shows a more abrupt\r\ndecline from about 1878 to 1886, since which year the course of both\r\nlines is about parallel. Its irregularity is also significant as\r\nillustrating the violent fluctuations to which the published rates were\r\nsubjected jected prior to 1887. Judged by this curve, the situation\r\nhas been more settled since the enactment of the Act to Regulate\r\nCommerce in 1887.\r\n\r\nWere data at hand for a continuation of this line to 1910 it would\r\nundoubtedly afford a fairly reliable measure, in general, of the\r\nsubstantial increase of rates which has taken place during the decade.\r\nThe main objection to it would be that it did not weight the average\r\naccording to the volume of the business carried for each of the\r\nthirty-seven concrete rates chosen.[504]\r\n\r\nTracing the rise of actual rates since 1900 is rendered peculiarly\r\ndifficult, also, by reason of the fact that few of the changes took\r\nthe form of an outright advance in charges. The end in view was\r\nmore often accomplished surreptitiously. The substantial increases\r\nin 1900[505] which inaugurated the upward movement were mainly\r\naccomplished by changes of classification. Modification of the carload\r\nratings brought about the same result. A notable instance appeared\r\nin the complaint of the dairy men in Wisconsin in 1909. An annual\r\nshipment of 38,000,000 lbs. of cheese to Chicago before 1899 moved\r\nat twenty cents per one hundred pounds, irrespective of the size of\r\nthe consignment. Ten years later the rate had become twenty-eight\r\ncents for less-than-carload lots, and twenty-two and one-half cents\r\nfor wholesale shipments. The relative disability of the small shipper\r\nunder the new circumstances is as significant as the rise of rate for\r\nall.[506] The increase of charges might be brought about in another way\r\nwithout actually advancing rates by a withdrawal of commodity ratings,\r\nthereby subjecting the shipper to the higher scale of classified\r\ncommodities. And, finally, a practical elimination of the rebate and\r\nthe cessation of general rate wars has usually resulted in a very\r\nsubstantial increase in the revenue of the carriers as well as in\r\nthe scale of charges imposed upon most shippers. Evidence upon this\r\npoint is officially given in connection with the rate increases of\r\n1903.[507] It thus appears that to follow step by step the movement of\r\nactual rates is an extremely complicated matter. Every factor entering\r\ninto the determination of the charge must be considered; the distance\r\ntariff, the classification, minimum carload rules and a host of other\r\nspecifications which enter into the final result. For our purposes it\r\nmust suffice that the fact of a substantial rise of charges since the\r\nturning point in 1900 is beyond question.[508] On the other hand, it\r\nis indubitable that such increases as have occurred, arousing vehement\r\nprotest among shippers, have been more widely advertised than changes\r\nin the opposite direction. Substantial reductions, especially on\r\nlow-grade staples, have sometimes occurred. One is almost at a loss to\r\nstrike a fair balance between the two, in the absence of dependable\r\ndata.\r\n\r\nThe movement of passenger fares has been quite different from that\r\nof freight rates.[509] No marked decline during the last quarter of\r\nthe nineteenth century took place. Growth in the volume of traffic\r\nwas not accomplished by a reduction of charges. This is in consonance\r\nwith the experience of foreign countries. Passenger business, while\r\nsteadily growing, has increased less rapidly than freight tonnage.\r\nGenerally, in other words, as measured by volume, freight business has\r\nbecome relatively more important with the progress of time. Fiscally\r\nthe same thing is true. Only in New England does the revenue from this\r\nservice approximate one-half of the total net earnings. The nature of\r\nrailway competition explains why passenger fares have not decreased\r\nas rapidly as freight rates. Persons must necessarily be more or less\r\ndirectly transported from one point to another; while experience shows\r\nthat competition in freight traffic may be exceedingly circuitous in\r\nroute, goods even going hundreds of miles out of the direct line for\r\ntransportation by water. This narrowing of the sphere of competition\r\nin the case of passengers has consequently operated to lessen the\r\nrate of decline. Another point to be considered in this connection\r\nis that no such increasing economies in the handling of passengers\r\nare possible as in the case of freight. Instead of decreasing the\r\nproportion of dead weight, which for passengers amounts to upward\r\nof ninety per cent., by any of the economies recently applied to\r\nfreight traffic, it appears rather that the proportion of dead weight\r\nof equipment per passenger is increasing, owing to the necessity of\r\nproviding more sumptuous accommodations. Bearing in mind all these\r\nfacts, it appears not unreasonable that the progressive decline of\r\npassenger fares has continually lagged behind the decrease of freight\r\nrates. But the natural lethargy in the movement of passenger fares was\r\nrudely interrupted in 1908 in connection with the wave of legislation\r\naccompanying the Roosevelt campaign which culminated in the Mann-Elkins\r\nlaw. A widespread demand for lower passenger fares found expression\r\nin the passage by twenty-two states within five years of maximum fare\r\nlaws. Eleven legislatures fixed the charge at two cents per mile, the\r\nothers establishing it at less than three cents. Many appeals to the\r\ncourts in connection with these statutes took place on the ground of\r\nconfiscation, and sharp conflicts of authority between Federal and\r\nstate governments arose.[510] Whether passenger rates would ever have\r\ndeclined without such exercise of authority is open to question, but\r\nthe disturbance of established conditions at this time was extreme.\r\n\r\nOne further question with relation to the movement of rates merits\r\nconsideration. In how far has the rise since 1900 been commensurate\r\nwith the general upward movement of prices of other commodities than\r\ntransportation--the particular commodity produced by railways? The\r\nevidence tends to show that prices in general have moved upward during\r\nthe last ten years by approximately one-fourth, and it may be even\r\none-third.[511] Have railway charges in general surpassed this rate or\r\nnot?\r\n\r\nSome activity of railway experts has been devoted of late to the\r\nelucidation of this question.[512] But, after all, is this inquiry\r\nof basic importance as bearing upon the general reasonableness of\r\nrailway rates? Here, as so often elsewhere in the discussion of\r\nthese questions, the need is for the analysis of such problems with\r\nreference to particular services and not in connection with matters\r\nin general.[513] It is conceivable that railway rates might and\r\nproperly ought to increase under certain circumstances much more than\r\nin proportion to the general change in freight rates; or that, on\r\nthe other hand, they might fairly be compelled to lag behind. This\r\nintroduces the larger question of reasonable rates in general which\r\nmust remain for discussion in our second volume.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe general level of rates affects the ultimate consumer more than the\r\nshipper. Steadiness of rates, on the other hand, is vital to a healthy\r\nstate of trade. It is important to examine the evidence from this point\r\nof view. The history of railroad rates shows a steady improvement\r\nin the direction of more general observance of published tariffs.\r\nPeriods of abject demoralization incidental to the most furious rate\r\nwars, have alternated with periods of peace, characterized by more or\r\nless faithful observance of agreed rates. Viewed in a large way the\r\nintervals of disturbance have become less frequent and less intense\r\nwith the passage of time. Present conditions are more satisfactory than\r\nany which have prevailed since 1850.\r\n\r\nRate wars are almost as old as railroading and are coincident with\r\nthe appearance of competition. Among the earliest of note were the\r\nstruggles between the Erie and the New York Central as soon as the\r\nformer road was constructed to Dunkirk, Ohio, on the Great Lakes.\r\nBut the most notorious rate wars were those which prevailed between\r\nthe trunk lines in respect of the carriage of grain to the seaboard.\r\nThese wars began with the entrance of the trunk lines into Chicago in\r\n1869.[514] The Baltimore and Ohio from the outset was the disturbing\r\nfactor. Having no entry into New York except over the lines of the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad, the refusal of the latter in 1874 to give\r\nproper facilities led to immediate retaliation by rate cutting on\r\nthe Baltimore and Ohio. The details of these wars and their economic\r\nsignificance have become classics in our American industrial history.\r\nSuffice it to say that for intensity and persistence these contests\r\nwhich lasted for ten years after 1884, have been unequalled in our\r\nhistory since that time. A brief period of calm ensued after 1876.\r\nBut soon the struggle broke out again in 1881, intensified by the\r\nconstruction of new parallel trunk lines like the West Shore and the\r\nNickel Plate. These latter rate disturbances lasted for about three\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe passage of the Act to Regulate Commerce in 1887 greatly improved\r\nthe rate situation for a time;[515] but harmonious relations were\r\nrudely shaken by a bitter rate war in 1888 between the Grand Trunk\r\nRailway and the American Lines with reference to the rates upon dressed\r\nbeef. Trouble over this traffic had occurred as far back as 1879,\r\nwhen the rate from Chicago to New York had been cut from one dollar\r\nto forty-five cents. In 1888, however, the rate on dressed beef for\r\nweeks was as low as six cents per hundred pounds. The Grand Trunk which\r\nhad carried almost half of this business in 1887, had its proportion\r\nreduced to twenty-eight per cent. in the following year. At this time\r\nalso extensive rate wars prevailed in the far western territory. The\r\nfailure of the Atchison Road brought to light accumulated rebates\r\nfor the four years prior to 1894 to the amount of $3,700,000. The\r\nprosperity of the early nineties led to a considerable improvement\r\nin rate observances. The only exception was the persistence of\r\ntrouble from the Canadian carriers. The Soo line across the Straits\r\nof Mackinac, opening a short route from St. Paul and Minneapolis to\r\nthe seaboard, was acquired by the Canadian Pacific Railroad in 1890.\r\nCombined lake-and-rail grain rates were sadly disturbed and the\r\ncontroversy over so-called ex-Lake grain between the lines from Buffalo\r\nto New York, which afterward cropped out in 1900, took its beginning.\r\nThese Canadian Pacific rate wars were severe while they lasted. In\r\n1892, for instance, the rate on boots and shoes from Boston to St.\r\nPaul dropped from one dollar and fifteen cents per hundredweight to\r\nforty-five cents.\r\n\r\nThe panic and subsequent depression of 1893 caused serious and\r\nwidespread rate wars all over the country. Grain rates from Chicago to\r\nNew York were openly reduced from twenty-five to fifteen cents. Two\r\npeculiarities of this rate war deserve mention. In the first place,\r\nevery concession was publicly made,--that is to say, the cut rates\r\nwere filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission; and, consequently,\r\nowing to the percentage-basis system to intermediate points, the rate\r\nwar on Chicago-New York business automatically induced a rate war to\r\nevery intermediate point in Central Traffic Association territory.\r\nTranscontinental rates were also badly upset at the same time. This\r\nwas due not only to the prevalent hard times, but to complications\r\narising from the independence of the Panama Railway. This line had been\r\ncontrolled since 1871 by the Union Pacific Railroad. The arrangement\r\nunder which the Pacific Mail Steamship Company was also controlled came\r\nto an end in 1893, when the field was again opened to competition.\r\nThe merchants of San Francisco established an independent line of\r\nsteamships and for two years the most bitter and reckless rate war\r\nprevailed. During this conflict freight was carried from New York to\r\nSan Francisco as low as thirty cents per hundredweight.[516] Matters\r\nwere finally settled in 1898; but in the meantime the Union Pacific\r\nRailroad had gone into bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nEntire demoralization in freight rates throughout the southern states\r\noccurred in 1894. Every carrier in this section was involved. Rates\r\nwere cut for two months by as much as two-thirds. The first-class\r\nrate from New York to Atlanta dropped from $1.14 to forty cents per\r\nhundred pounds. The years 1894-1895 for the country as a whole were\r\nexceedingly unfortunate. Better conditions then supervened except for\r\na rate war on grain at Missouri river points, so important that it\r\nwas made the subject of special investigation.[517] The Chicago Great\r\nWestern Railroad through the agency of a corporation known as the\r\nIowa Development Company actually purchased on its own account large\r\namounts of grain in order to secure its carriage. Grain was carried\r\nfrom Kansas City to Chicago under the system of rebating known as\r\n\"protecting the through rate\" for as low as two cents, when the open\r\npublished rate was seventeen cents per hundredweight. Conditions then\r\nbettered somewhat largely through the activities of the Joint Traffic\r\nand Trans-Missouri Freight Associations. The prospect of legalization\r\nof pooling by Congress was bright. Rates seem to have been observed\r\nwith more than usual faithfulness throughout the country, the only\r\nexception being another brief conflict in the southern states. But the\r\nTrans-Missouri decision by the United States Supreme Court in 1897,\r\ndeclaring these traffic associations illegal, once more precipitated\r\nmost unsatisfactory conditions. And these were accentuated by the\r\nbudding prosperity of the following year.\r\n\r\nWith the return of activity in business and agriculture in 1898\r\na frenzy for participation in the rapidly expanding traffic once\r\nmore brought about extreme disorganization. The Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission reported that \"a large part of the business at the present\r\ntime is transacted upon illegal rates ... in certain quarters the\r\nobservance of the published rate is the exception.\" The commissioner\r\nof the St. Louis Traffic Bureau testified before the United States\r\nIndustrial Commission that \"there were fewer rates maintained in 1898\r\nthan at any other time within my knowledge of the railroad business,\r\nand I have been in the railroad business for twenty-eight years.\" At\r\nthis point the Interstate Commerce Commission intervened by the proffer\r\nof its good offices. Conferences with the heads of the principal\r\nrailroads were held. A decided change in the attitude of the Commission\r\ntoward the carriers became evident. It wisely sought to arouse the\r\nrailroads themselves to the enormity of the existing evils, being\r\nabsolutely unable itself under the law either to prevent or correct\r\nthe existing abuses. The result fully justified all expectations. The\r\nfollowing year witnessed an almost complete restoration of published\r\nrates, although business continued to expand in volume. Naturally there\r\nwas ample for all the railroads to handle. This condition lasted for\r\nsome time. But during 1900 rate cutting again developed upon a large\r\nscale in westbound business. The great increase of eastbound shipments\r\nand the demand for return lading at any price was undoubtedly the\r\ncause. This condition lasted for some months.\r\n\r\nRate cutting between the trunk lines again broke out in the spring of\r\n1901, grain being hauled as low as eleven cents per hundred pounds\r\nfrom Chicago to New York. Competition between the Lake line railroads\r\nseems to have been the cause. The problem of adjusting ex-Lake grain\r\nrates dates from this period. The community-of-interest plan of trunk\r\nline control was ineffective to prevent disturbance. In the same\r\nyear a passenger rate war from the Missouri river to California was\r\nalso threatened. The United States Industrial Commission sent out\r\na number of inquiries concerning conditions in the summer of 1901.\r\nThis indicated a firm and stable rate condition in the East but some\r\ndisturbance on lines between Chicago and the Ohio river points. Trouble\r\nsoon broke out, however. The Atchison road suspecting its competitors\r\nof bad faith, cut its rates first-class from Chicago to the Missouri\r\nriver from eighty cents to fifty cents per hundredweight. Agreements\r\nwere repeatedly made and almost immediately violated, some of the\r\nstrongest lines being the worst offenders. During the fall of that year\r\nexport rates on flour and grain were badly slashed. The traffic manager\r\nof the New York Central lines testified that grain rates for export\r\nwere not maintained for a number of months.\r\n\r\nApparently the general situation in 1900 was more satisfactory than at\r\nany previous time in the history of railroading in the United States.\r\nWith few exceptions the published rates were observed. This commendable\r\nsituation seems to have been due to several causes. Primarily an\r\nadequate appreciation by the railroads themselves of the losses of\r\nrevenue to which they had voluntarily subjected themselves prevailed.\r\nAn enormous volume of traffic incident to general prosperity, also,\r\nalmost overtaxed the facilities of the carriers. And, in the third\r\nplace, the spread of consolidation and the community-of-interest idea\r\nundoubtedly contributed to the same end. The determined attitude\r\ntaken by important roads, notably the Southern Railway, contributed\r\nto the maintenance of rates. Even in the Far West and Northwest, rate\r\nconditions seemed to be in better shape than at almost any previous\r\ntime. But it was too good to last; trouble soon broke out again. Grain\r\nrates from Kansas to Chicago during the summer dropped from nineteen\r\ncents to seven cents. Rates on packing-house products became utterly\r\ndemoralized. So bad did conditions become that in March of 1902 the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission intervened, seeking injunctions in the\r\nFederal courts against any departure from the published tariffs. This\r\nimmediately bettered conditions; and in February of 1903 the passage\r\nof the Elkins law, as we shall see, contributed still further to this\r\nend. The enactment of this statute, passed at the solicitation of the\r\ncarriers themselves and imposing much severer penalties upon departure\r\nfrom published rates, brought about conditions during the spring\r\nof 1903 unsurpassed for stability. The only exception was a minor\r\ndisturbance concerning the carriage of ex-Lake grain from Buffalo to\r\nNew York. Tariffs seem to have been faithfully maintained throughout\r\nthe country with one exception, that is to say, concerning traffic to\r\nand from Missouri river points.\r\n\r\nSince the passage of the Elkins Amendments in 1903, the phenomenal\r\ndevelopment of export trade through the Gulf Ports, principally New\r\nOrleans and Galveston,[518] has been mainly responsible for recurring\r\nand often ferocious rate wars, particularly during the years 1903-1906.\r\nThese rate wars were usually precipitated in the first instance by\r\nstruggles between the Gulf railroads and the trunk lines for the\r\ncarriage of export corn. In 1904, for example, after a long period\r\nduring which little surplus corn was available for export from Iowa,\r\nKansas and Nebraska, much of it being locally consumed for stock\r\nfeeding, a large surplus was left over. Rates were promptly cut during\r\n1905 by both sets of lines. Thus the rate on export corn from Omaha\r\nto New Orleans was reduced from eighteen to eleven cents per hundred\r\npounds. This cut was promptly met by a reduction of rates from Missouri\r\nriver points to Chicago from twenty-four to thirteen cents. The rate\r\nfrom Omaha to New York dropped to the extraordinarily low figure\r\nof thirteen cents per hundred pounds. The Burlington and Missouri\r\nPacific Railroads were particularly active in this contest; together\r\nsecuring over eighty per cent. of the corn traffic, although five other\r\nimportant roads were operating in this territory. All through the\r\nwinter and spring of 1905 the struggle went on unabated. The Gulf ports\r\nduring this period increased their exports of corn two and one-half\r\ntimes over. The struggle was not alone confined to the carriage of\r\ngrain; although export flour being manufactured so far north, seems to\r\nhave been immune from disturbance. The trouble extended over into the\r\nfield of packing-house products for export. It was long thought that\r\nthis could not be shipped over the roundabout southern route, but its\r\npracticability was demonstrated at this time. The demand of the Gulf\r\nroads for a ten per cent. differential rate in their favor as an offset\r\nfor the greater time requisite for transit, not being accorded, rates\r\nwere again cut by one-third, sometimes being as low as twenty cents per\r\nhundred pounds.\r\n\r\nThe rate wars of 1905 in the carriage of export traffic immediately\r\nspread into the field of imports. Competition for transcontinental\r\nand far western business has always been keen by the Gulf routes. The\r\nnotable Import Rate case already discussed, offers a good illustration\r\nof this fact. The great volume of tonnage moving outward through\r\nGalveston and New Orleans necessitated a correspondingly heavy\r\nnorthern and northwestern movement of empty cars. Hence the railroads\r\nleading from the Gulf ports, actively bid both against one another\r\nand in connection with the steamship lines against the trunk lines.\r\nCompetition was particularly keen for the carriage of the large volume\r\nof sugar to the Middle West, particularly Missouri river points like\r\nSt. Louis and Omaha. Carriers from every point of the compass were\r\ninterested in this traffic. The trunk lines brought refined sugar from\r\nthe seaboard cities where the West Indian product is concentrated. The\r\nGulf lines brought the Louisiana product, partly as a back-load against\r\nexported grain. And the transcontinental lines brought the Hawaiian\r\nsugar, also as a back-load against a predominance of westbound tonnage.\r\nAll hands thus directly took part.[519] For three years this sugar war\r\npersisted despite all attempts at harmony. Rates were constantly cut\r\nby fifty per cent., always of course to the profit of the large sugar\r\nrefiners. Coffee, also constituting an important part of our import\r\ntrade, and of course particularly adapted to entry through the Gulf\r\nports, was carried at ruinous rates. Thus on green coffee during 1905,\r\nthe rate from New Orleans to St. Paul was cut from forty to fifteen\r\ncents per hundred pounds, while coincidently the rate on sugar dropped\r\nfrom thirty-two to ten cents. The struggle for import business extended\r\nfinally to all imports of merchandise from Europe. The Illinois\r\nCentral, for example, actively bid for the imported plate glass\r\nbusiness about this time. At a meeting of parties concerned in 1905,\r\nthe fact developed that every one of the important lines had entered\r\ninto contracts for the carriage of this traffic at rates approximately\r\none-half those normally prevalent. The trunk lines of course had to\r\nmeet this competition or lose the business. The Pennsylvania Railroad\r\ncut the rate on crockery from forty to eighteen cents; on imported\r\nseeds the rate dropped from fifty to twenty cents and on toys from\r\nseventy-five to twenty-five cents per hundred pounds. These rate wars\r\nit will be observed differed neither in extent nor degree from those\r\nof a generation earlier. One cannot avoid the conclusion that the\r\nutter demoralization of rates was ended only by the intervention of\r\nthe Federal government; first by the sturdy and determined application\r\nof the Elkins Law under President Roosevelt's personal direction, and\r\nlater by extension of the principle of supervision and regulation by\r\nthe Hepburn Act of 1906.\r\n\r\nThe principal breach since the sugar wars was a rather persistent and\r\nlocally interesting disturbance of westbound import rates, precipitated\r\nin the spring of 1909 by the Boston & Maine Railroad. Its object was\r\nto overcome the disability against the port of Boston in the matter\r\nof imports, due to the differentials allowed at Philadelphia and\r\nBaltimore.[520] This led to a general trunk line upset lasting about\r\nfour months, in the course of which rates from Boston to Chicago were\r\nreduced from sixty-nine to fifty-eight cents. This obviously left\r\nlittle profit in the business. Yet it was a mild concession as compared\r\nwith the struggles of earlier years. Two years later, in June, 1911,\r\ntrouble threatened to break out again. This time it was the Delaware\r\n& Hudson and Erie roads which filed reduced rates to the interior. But\r\nthe solidarity of feeling between the trunk lines was such that an open\r\nbreach was prevented at the last moment. The prompt intervention of\r\nthe Federal authorities was a noticeable feature on this occasion. It\r\nmay somewhat safely be predicated that further serious disturbance in\r\nfuture is unlikely to occur.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[487] U. S.

Series, Div. of\r\nStatistics, U. S. Dept. of Agriculture, 1898, pp. 1-80.\r\n\r\n[504] The continuation of Commons' index number of freight rates\r\nto date, seemed inadvisable on account of the changes in traffic\r\nconditions which have taken place. Originally well selected, the\r\nthirty-seven rates chosen in 1900 are not now representative. There\r\nare, for instance, no transcontinental quotations at all; none from\r\nthe southern states, such as on raw cotton; none for the great staples\r\nelsewhere moving under commodity ratings, such as iron ore, chemical\r\nfertilizers, lumber, citrus fruit, etc. Moreover, twelve of the\r\nthirty-seven items chosen by Commons were rates on petroleum which now\r\nmoves in bulk in pipe lines except locally. Several of the quotations\r\nfor coal, and for all the other carload rates, as a matter of fact,\r\nhave been so affected by changes in carload minimum rules, that the\r\nmere rate by itself has little significance.\r\n\r\nRejecting Commons' particular index number by reason of its inherent\r\ndefects does not, however, lessen the desirability of choosing some\r\nother combination of rates which may be used as a standard for\r\nmeasurement of rate changes year by year. Yet the selection of such an\r\nindex number is open to all the difficulties attaching to a similar\r\nindex number of prices. Is the object, for example, an academic\r\ndetermination of rate changes _per se_; or is it intended to ascertain\r\nthe financial burden of such charges upon the community? In the\r\nformer case the volume of traffic affected would not be an important\r\nconsideration. Local rates on indigo or millinery would be given the\r\nsame weight as similar changes in the rate on wheat between Chicago and\r\nthe Atlantic seaboard. The latter mode of approaching the question, on\r\nthe other hand, would correspond to an index number of prices, weighted\r\naccording to the volume of consumption. A doubled freight rate on\r\nhard coal to Perth Amboy would outweigh an equal change in the charge\r\non castile soap in exact proportion to its commercial importance as\r\nmeasured by the total tonnage transported. Many such details would\r\ncall for careful consideration before the final adoption of the rate\r\nitems chosen to constitute the index number; but the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission might well consider the initiation of such a\r\nstatistical project, endeavoring to do for railroad rates what the\r\nFederal Commissioner of Labor performs so satisfactorily in officially\r\nrecording current changes in the price of commodities. Such a record\r\nof railroad rates extending over a series of years, supplemented by\r\ndata for ton mileage revenue, would be invaluable in the determination\r\nof the reasonableness of rate advances in future; even as the rate\r\nincreases of 1910 clearly pointed to the need of a similar standard for\r\npurposes of comparison from year to year in the past.\r\n\r\n[505] U.S. Industrial Commission, XIX, pp. 281-291; 58th Cong., 2nd\r\nsess., Sen.

Great laws are not\r\nthe figments of men's minds, conjured up in a day. They are a response\r\nto the needs of the time. Their true causes are thus immeasurably\r\ncomplex. Nor does a wholesale public demand for legislation arise\r\novernight. From small beginnings the pressure steadily grows,\r\noftentimes for years; until, perhaps through a conjuncture of\r\nparticularly aggravating events, matters are at last brought suddenly\r\nto a head. Yet while this culmination of industrial or social pressure\r\nmay finally result in legislation under some particularly strong\r\npolitical leadership, to assign such personal influence as even the\r\nremote cause of legislation, is to belie all the facts and experience\r\nof history. No clearer illustration of the close relationship between\r\neconomic causes and statutory results could perhaps be found, than in\r\nthe field of our Federal legislation concerning common carriers. It\r\nforms one of the most important chapters in our industrial history.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the economic causes of the Act to Regulate Commerce of\r\n1887, are deep-rooted in the preceding decade. A few even run back\r\nto Civil War times. Foremost among these was the rapid expansion of\r\nthe railway net; and particularly, as outlined in our introductory\r\nhistorical chapter, its phenomenal growth during the eighties. More\r\nnew mileage was laid down in the year of the Act itself than at any\r\nother time in our entire history within a single twelvemonth. Of equal\r\nsignificance, however, was the far more than commensurate development\r\nof long distance, that is to say, interstate business. The through\r\ncarriage of livestock and grain to the seaboard for export attained\r\nimmense importance; and the settlement of the Middle West called for\r\na corresponding westward movement of manufactured goods. The Windom\r\nCommittee of 1874 on \"Transportation Routes to the Seaboard\"[522] bears\r\neloquent testimony to the growing importance of this through traffic\r\nas a factor in legislative activity. According to the Cullom Committee\r\nReport twelve years later,[523] approximately three-fourths of the\r\nrailway traffic of the country was already at that time interstate in\r\ncharacter. On the trunk lines, excepting the Pennsylvania Railroad\r\nwhich still relied more largely on Pittsburg-Philadelphia tonnage, more\r\nnearly nine-tenths of the traffic consisted of through, as distinct\r\nfrom local, business. Obviously, this pointed to the assumption of\r\nauthority by the Federal government, if any were to be exercised;\r\ninasmuch as the separate states, as will shortly appear, were held by\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States in 1886 to be powerless to deal\r\nwith interstate commerce.\r\n\r\nThe growing disposition of Congress to assume control over interstate\r\nbusiness had already been evinced in the passage of two Federal\r\nstatutes. One in 1872 had dealt with abuses in the carriage of\r\nlivestock. And another, even earlier, had sought to remove obstacles\r\nset up by local jealousy and monopoly to the through carriage of\r\ngoods. Some railway charters actually prohibited railroads from making\r\nconnections with other lines; or from allowing cars to leave their\r\nown rails. The Erie, for example, was thus hampered; lest the trade\r\nof southern New York be diverted to rival seaports. But the military\r\nnecessity of through transport of troops, and the impediments to speedy\r\nand cheap carriage of mails and goods through delays at junction\r\npoints, impelled Congress to authorize, though not as yet to compel,\r\nthe formation of through routes and the issue of through bills of\r\nlading by the Act of 1866. The immediate response to this permissive\r\nlegislation was the rise of the private car lines, elsewhere described,\r\nin connection with personal discrimination and also in the general\r\nhistorical review.[524]\r\n\r\nNo widespread demand for a general reduction of railroad rates seems\r\nto have existed in 1887. In this regard the situation is strikingly in\r\ncontrast with that which prevailed during the protracted hard times\r\nsucceeding the panic of 1873. Acute industrial depression during that\r\nperiod had aroused deep public feeling against the \"extortions of\r\nsoulless railway corporations.\" It was but natural that all the farmers\r\nin the newly settled states should actively participate in the Granger\r\nmovement. The popular war cry in this agitation was lower freight\r\nrates. This demand is voiced in the President's message of 1872,\r\ncalling for \"more certain and cheaper transportation, of the rapidly\r\nincreasing western and southern products, to the Atlantic seaboard.\"\r\nThe proposals of the Senate to attain these objects are contained in\r\nthe above-mentioned Windom Committee Report of 1874. Competition is to\r\nbe stimulated by the development of waterways and new trunk lines. A\r\nbureau of commerce is proposed. The long and short haul principle in\r\nrate making is to be enforced. Stock-watering is to be prohibited; and\r\npublicity of rates to be brought about. On the whole, reduced charges\r\nare to be secured rather by means of natural competition among carriers\r\nthan through legislation. But the keynote of the Windom Report of 1874\r\nis cheaper carriage of goods,--a general reduction of rates all along\r\nthe line.\r\n\r\nMany things happened during the next twelve years to modify this\r\ndemand. By 1886, according to the Cullom Committee, \"the paramount\r\nevil chargeable against the operation of the transportation systems of\r\nthe United States, as now conducted, is unjust discrimination between\r\npersons, places, commodities, or particular descriptions of traffic.\"\r\nPurely economic events had brought about this change of opinion.\r\nThe rate wars of the seventies; a revival of general prosperity in\r\n1879; and great mechanical improvements and economies in operation,\r\nhad brought about the desired decline of freight rates.[525] For the\r\ntime the bogey of extortionate charges was laid at rest. The Act of\r\n1887, elaborate as it was in form, seems not to have been intended to\r\ndeal with rates in any general way. It was in the main aimed at the\r\nprevention of specific abuses. \"The practice of discrimination in one\r\nform or another is the principal cause of complaint.\" Consequently, the\r\nlong succession of bills introduced in the House of Representatives\r\nyear after year for more than a decade by Judge Reagan of Texas and\r\nothers, made no attempt to provide administrative machinery by which\r\nto fix rates in general; but sought merely to prohibit these specific\r\nabuses by statute.[526] The proposition for a permanent commission\r\nto deal with rates in a more comprehensive way, seems, as we shall\r\nsee, to have emanated from the Senate at a later time. But this more\r\nstatesman-like proposition from the upper chamber was essentially\r\ndifferent from the response in the House of Representatives to popular\r\nfeeling against discriminatory practices, which slowly gathered force\r\nduring more than a decade of agitation and debate.\r\n\r\nWhat now were some of the specific \"discriminations\" which these\r\nvarious bills in Congress aimed to prevent? And why did the\r\nmovement come to a head in 1887? The evidence is conclusive that\r\npersonal favoritism as between rival shippers took first place. The\r\nindiscriminate and cut-throat competition of the carriers, particularly\r\nin connection with the trunk line rate wars, offered a golden\r\nopportunity to those in search of secret and preferential rates.[527]\r\nThe chief offender, of course, was the Standard Oil Company under the\r\ndirection of John D. Rockefeller. The Cassatt revelations in 1877 as\r\nto exclusive contracts with the great trunk lines for the carriage\r\nof oil, greatly stirred public opinion. Congressional attention had\r\nbeen directed to the subject some years before by complaints from the\r\nPennsylvania field. But the abortive results of the investigation of\r\n1875 demonstrated nothing beyond the shameful impudence of the chief\r\noffenders. According to the New York (Hepburn) Committee investigation\r\nin 1879, few shippers had ever seen printed tariffs. The Assistant\r\nGeneral Freight Agent of the New York Central testified that one-half\r\nthe business out of New York, and nine-tenths out of Syracuse went on\r\nspecial rates. At this time there was also unrest in the anthracite\r\ncoal trade. Moreover, the activity of the \"eveners\" in the cattle\r\nbusiness in 1875-1879[528] had laid the foundation for still other\r\nmonopolies built up by means of rebates. But the constant irritant\r\nin the public eye was the Standard Oil Company.[529] The Lake Shore\r\ncase, fought through every Ohio court and then on appeal up to the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States in 1886, widely advertised the\r\ndiscriminatory practices of the railroads. But the most spectacular\r\ndisclosures of all took place in 1885-1888 in the George Rice cases in\r\nOhio. The Cullom Committee in recommending publicity of rates as its\r\nprimary remedy for the evils of the time, specifically cites \"this most\r\nimpudent and outrageous\" proceeding.[530] In the protracted struggle\r\nin conference committee upon the provisions of the act, elimination of\r\nrebates was the only subject upon which both House and Senate conferees\r\nwere in thorough accord from the start. Whatever the commercial crimes\r\nchargeable to the founder of the Standard Oil Company, he should, at\r\nleast, be credited with the performance of a great public service in\r\nfinally crystallising public opinion in 1887 in favor of railroad\r\nlegislation for the prevention of rebating.\r\n\r\nDistrust of monopoly has always loomed up large in the public eye.\r\nThe dread of it is voiced in every public document of the time. The\r\nWindom Committee in 1874, as we have seen, looked to the stimulation\r\nof railway competition as its chief remedy against high rates. Five\r\nyears later, the Hepburn Committee in New York vehemently denounced\r\nrailroad monopoly as an evil to be sternly repressed. But, in the\r\nmeantime, the carriers, almost prostrated by the excesses of their rate\r\nwars, were slowly learning how to coöperate for the maintenance of more\r\nstable charges. Railroad pools and traffic agreements, first essayed\r\nabout 1875, were gradually elaborated; until by 1886 nearly all parts\r\nof the country were covered by them.[531] From small beginnings in\r\n1877, the Trunk Line Association under Albert Fink was in its heyday\r\nof activity. The Southern Railway Association was restoring order out\r\nof chaos, south of the Ohio river. By 1886 all competitive traffic\r\nnorth and west of Chicago was pooled. This was especially true of\r\nthe highly competitive business between the Missouri and Mississippi\r\nrivers. Even in remoter regions, such agreements threatened to\r\ndeprive the public of the benefits of rival railroad construction.\r\nIn Colorado and New Mexico public sentiment was deeply aroused over\r\nthe tripartite division of territory between the carriers then in the\r\nfield.[532] The helplessness of independent railroads was made evident\r\nin connection with the attempt of the (now) Colorado & Southern road\r\nto gain a foothold. Its suits in both state and Federal courts, and\r\nthe attempted remedial legislation by Colorado in 1885, disclosed the\r\ngreat power of monopoly over the public welfare in that region. In\r\nTexas, the Gould-Huntington apportionment of the field between the two\r\nsystems in 1881,[533] was doubtless perceived as to its results, even\r\nif its precise terms were secret. The Texas Traffic Association, also,\r\norganized in 1875, embraced all the lines in that vicinity. May it not\r\nwell be that the final inclusion in the Act of 1887 of the prohibition\r\nof pooling, upon direct insistence of the Texas representative in\r\nCongress against the protest of the Senate, had some connection with\r\nthese events? It seems clear that the marked interest of the railways\r\nin eliminating competition all over the country at this critical time,\r\ncarried great weight with Congress in shaping the law.\r\n\r\nThe years since the Civil War had witnessed an ever increasing\r\nvolume of speculation and fraud in railway affairs, which reached\r\nits climax in the frenzied construction period of the eighties.[534]\r\nJay Gould, \"Jim\" Fisk and their successors who contributed to the\r\n\"railway panic\" of 1884, had done their work well in arousing public\r\nhostility to the railroads. The Hepburn Committee Report in New York\r\nis symptomatic of the state of feeling in its vehement denunciation\r\nof these practices.[535] The Windom Committee, five years earlier,\r\nhad officially registered its opinion that of all the abuses of the\r\ntime, \"none have contributed so much to the general discontent and\r\nindignation as the increase of railway capital by _stock watering_ and\r\n_capitalization of surplus earnings_. The murmurs of discontent have\r\nswollen into a storm of popular indignation. Your committee believe\r\nthe evil to be of such magnitude as to justify and require for its\r\nprevention the coöperation of both Congress and the States.\"[536]\r\nNor is the Cullom Committee less emphatic in 1886; although its\r\ncondemnation is shifted from the trunk lines, particularly the New\r\nYork Central and the Erie, to the newly constructed \"unnecessary\r\nroads.\" \"This practice (of stock watering) has unquestionably done\r\nmore to create and keep alive a popular feeling of hostility against\r\nthe railroads of the United States than any other one cause.\"[537] All\r\nwere agreed that the remedy must be applied by the states, from which\r\nthe companies derived their charters. But a powerful impulse toward\r\npublicity of accounts and operating details as well as of rates, to\r\nbe enforced by the hand of the Federal government, was unquestionably\r\nimparted by the financial scandals of the time. It was hoped that\r\nfraudulent construction concerns, subsidiary companies for \"milking\"\r\nthe main corporation, unnecessary paralleling of existing lines for\r\npurposes of blackmail, speculative bankruptcies and all similar\r\npractices of the period might be restrained in part by letting in the\r\nlight of day upon their affairs.\r\n\r\nThen again, there were the discriminations in rates, so vehemently\r\ndenounced, against the small towns and local business, in favor of\r\nthe large cities mainly interested in long distance traffic. Such\r\njealousies and rivalries of course antedate the railroad. They are\r\nalmost as old as trade. And yet the course of affairs since the panic\r\nof 1873, had lent peculiar force to them by the middle of the eighties.\r\nIt had been a period of ruinous railroad competition all over the\r\nland, but especially in trunk line territory. Through rates had fallen\r\ntremendously; without any corresponding change in local charges.[538]\r\nThe great western cities and the remote farmers were the immediate\r\nbeneficiaries, of course. But there were the older communities of\r\nthe East to be reckoned with,[539]--the farmers of New England and\r\nMiddle New York and the secondary cities which had once been terminal\r\npoints but were now become way stations. In the South, new towns were\r\nspringing up, anxious to divide distributive trade with the older\r\ncotton concentration points. Nashville, soon to take first place in a\r\ncelebrated case, was being built up by a favoring railway; and Atlanta,\r\na purely railroad town, was in rapid growth at the expense of older\r\nrivals. The separate states had long sought to deal with this ancient\r\nevil of local discrimination in rates by means of long and short haul\r\nclauses; but to little effect. What wonder that the Cullom Committee in\r\n1886, heads its long list of \"complaints against the railroad system of\r\nthe United States\" by two forms of this alleged evil!\r\n\r\nIn brief, the contemporary evidence all goes to show that,--quite aside\r\nfrom evil intent,--the railroad business of the United States in the\r\nmiddle of the eighties, was in a highly disorganized state. Phenomenal\r\neconomic development since the resumption of specie payments in 1879,\r\nhad perhaps outstripped the capacity of managements to scientifically\r\norder their affairs. Collateral evidence as to this is the\r\nextraordinary wastefulness, of operation which prevailed. Competition\r\nhad run mad. All of the tricks and vagaries of roundabout routing of\r\nfreight found place.[540] To keep pace with mere operating demands\r\nwas a heavy enough task,--to say nothing of constructing well-ordered\r\ntariffs, keeping straight accounts, and providing adequate funds for\r\ngrowth. And out of this unsettled condition of affairs there had sprung\r\nthe usual mushroom crop of speculation, fraud and corruption which is\r\nbound to flourish at such times.\r\n\r\nAnd then, finally, in seeking to understand the economic situation\r\nin 1887, the intolerable arrogance of great railway managers must be\r\nkept in mind. Honorable exceptions there must have been, to be sure.\r\nBut the \"Public be damned\" attitude of the old Commodore Vanderbilt\r\nwas evidently a general, although perhaps a somewhat exaggerated one.\r\nIt is certain that there was no well-defined sense of responsibility\r\nto the public. All attempts at investigation or reform were treated\r\nas \"interference with private business.\" The rising tide of popular\r\nfeeling was increased by evidence of corrupt political practices,\r\nas well as of mere crude contempt for the rights of patrons. Read\r\nthe congressional debates upon the Camden and Amboy monopoly in New\r\nJersey; the special laws \"jammed\" through the state legislature by the\r\nNew York Central Railroad;[541] and the revelations as to corruption\r\nin the Credit Mobilier and other proceedings in Congress.[542] Such\r\nthings added fuel to the flames in the East, kindled and kept alive in\r\nthe West by the Granger movement. The time for an attempt to curb the\r\nsecond great manifestation of corporate power in the United States was\r\nindeed at hand. The only question was as to the form which it should\r\nassume.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe congressional history of the Act of 1887 extends over a period\r\nof nearly fifteen years. The first general bill to pass the House of\r\nRepresentatives in 1874, had for its object a reduction of rates; but\r\nthe movement for the elimination of discriminatory practices did not\r\nbegin until two years later. Then in 1877, came the first of the long\r\nseries of bills which finally led up to the statute in its final form,\r\nprepared by Representative Reagan of Texas. But it was not until 1884\r\nthat the Senate, ever tardy in its response to public sentiment, began\r\nto take the matter seriously. Its earlier interest in reduced rates\r\nhad dissipated, ten years before, with the Windom Committee Report.\r\nNow, however, under the leadership of the Senator from Illinois, the\r\nCullom Committee brought in a bill, the distinctive feature of which\r\nwas provision for a permanent administrative commission. The various\r\nHouse bills, in their distrust of executive appointments and authority,\r\nhad favored leaving the elimination of abuses, once clearly defined\r\nby law, to the Federal courts. A legislative deadlock between the two\r\nchambers resulted upon this point; as well as concerning the status of\r\npooling. For the House sought to prohibit all traffic agreements; while\r\nthe Senate would permit them under proper administrative supervision.\r\n\r\nAt this critical juncture the Supreme Court decision in the Wabash, St.\r\nLouis, and Pacific Railway case[543] was handed down. It specifically\r\ndenied to the individual states, power to regulate the ever-increasing\r\nvolume of interstate traffic. This decision put the match to the long\r\ntrain of influences making for action. The Senate and House bills were\r\ntherefore taken up in conference committee, with the usual outcome of\r\ngive and take. The Senate gained its point of administrative, rather\r\nthan judicial, control. A commission was provided; but the courts were\r\naccorded power to entertain appeals. On the other hand, the House\r\nconferees insisted upon the prohibition of pooling and a more stringent\r\nlong and short haul clause. All were agreed in respect to the publicity\r\nfeatures. The series of votes at different times with steadily growing\r\nmajorities, leading up finally to the passage of this compromise\r\nstatute by both houses, is significant of the progress of public\r\nopinion upon the matter.\r\n\r\n                      _House of Representatives_  _Senate_\r\n\r\n  1874  Passed                121 to 116             --\r\n  1877    \"                   139 to 104             --\r\n  1884    \"                   161 to  75          43 to 12\r\n  1886    \"                   192 to  41          47 to  4\r\n  1887    \"                   219 to  41          37 to 12\r\n\r\nThe constitutionality of the Act to Regulate Commerce of 1887 need not\r\nlong concern us.[544] Everything depended upon the interpretation of\r\nthe clause in the Constitution conferring upon Congress power over\r\ncommerce with foreign nations and among the states. A generation\r\nearlier the regulation of railroads by Federal statute might not have\r\nbeen sanctioned. But Lincoln and Grant had dealt a death blow to the\r\nold states' rights idea. And the positive legislation after the Civil\r\nWar prior to this time, had already denoted a much more progressive\r\nand liberal point of view. The far-reaching decisions of the Supreme\r\nCourt following _Munn v. Illinois_ in 1876 had clearly upheld the\r\npower of the several states to regulate commerce. The situation called\r\nonly for definition of the dividing line between state and Federal\r\nauthority. This was accorded in the Wabash case, which, as has already\r\nbeen stated, terminated the congressional deadlock, and brought about\r\nan agreement upon the terms of the law. Nor is it without significance,\r\nin the light of subsequent events, that the Wabash case was an appeal\r\nby a common carrier to Federal authority for protection against a state\r\nstatute.\r\n\r\nA brief summary of the main provisions of the Act to Regulate Commerce,\r\nat this point, will be convenient for future reference.\r\n\r\n    Section 1. It applies to freight and passengers by land; or by\r\n    land and water in cases of continuous or through shipment, even\r\n    to foreign countries. All charges shall be reasonable and just;\r\n    and every unjust and unreasonable charge is prohibited.\r\n\r\n    Section 2. Rebates and personal discrimination of every sort\r\n    forbidden.\r\n\r\n    Section 3. Local discrimination forbidden; equal facilities for\r\n    interchange of traffic with connecting lines prescribed.\r\n\r\n    Section 4. Long and short haul clause: \"That it shall be\r\n    unlawful for any common carrier subject to the provisions of\r\n    this act, to charge or receive any greater compensation in the\r\n    aggregate for the transportation of passengers or of like kind\r\n    of property, under substantially similar circumstances and\r\n    conditions, for a shorter than for a longer distance over the\r\n    same line, in the same direction, the shorter being included\r\n    within the longer distance; but this shall not be construed as\r\n    authorizing any common carrier within the terms of this act to\r\n    charge and receive as great compensation for a shorter as for a\r\n    longer distance: _Provided_, _however_, That upon application\r\n    to the Commission appointed under the provisions of this act,\r\n    such common carrier may, in special cases, after investigation\r\n    by the Commission, be authorized to charge less for longer than\r\n    for shorter distances for the transportation of passengers or\r\n    property; and the Commission may from time to time prescribe\r\n    the extent to which such designated common carrier may be\r\n    relieved from the operation of this section of this act.\"\r\n\r\n    Section 5. All pooling and traffic agreements prohibited.\r\n\r\n    Section 6. All rates and fares to be printed and posted\r\n    for public inspection at all stations; and filed with the\r\n    Commission at Washington. No advance in rates except after ten\r\n    days notice. All charges, other than as published, forbidden.\r\n\r\n    Section 9. Procedure by complaint before the Commission or\r\n    Federal courts. Power to compel testimony and production of\r\n    papers.\r\n\r\n    Section 10. Penalty of $5000 for each offence in violation.\r\n    (Amended in 1889, adding imprisonment.)\r\n\r\n    Section 11. Interstate Commerce Commission of five members\r\n    established; by Presidential appointment; term six years.\r\n\r\n    Section 12. Powers of Commission to inquire, with right to\r\n    obtain full information necessary to exercise of its authority.\r\n    Power over witnesses and production of papers, to be sustained\r\n    by U. S. Circuit Courts.\r\n\r\n    Sections 13-14. Procedure before Commission by complaint.\r\n    Parties competent to appear. Decisions to include findings of\r\n    fact upon which based, for courts on appeal.\r\n\r\n    Section 15. Duty of Commission to notify carriers to \"cease and\r\n    desist\" from violation, or to make reparation for injury done.\r\n\r\n    Section 16. To enforce obedience, procedure by petition of\r\n    Commission in Federal courts, which may issue writs.\r\n\r\n    Section 20. Annual detailed reports from carriers as to\r\n    finance, operation, rates or regulations in prescribed forms as\r\n    desired by the Commission.\r\n\r\nSuch is the substance of the statute which marks the real, beginning\r\nof subjection of the railroads to control by the Federal government.\r\nIt was avowedly tentative in character. It was a compromise, entirely\r\nsatisfactory to no one. Many of its provisions were not new.\r\nAdministrative commissions had already been in existence some time in\r\nseveral of the states. Pooling had also commonly been condemned. The\r\nlong and short haul clause in the statute constitutes no innovation.\r\nIt was based specifically upon a number of state laws, more or less\r\nsimilar to it in tenor.[545] In Vermont, for example, since 1850; in\r\nVirginia, since 1867; and in Massachusetts, since 1874, long and short\r\nhaul clauses had been in force. Some seventeen states, prior to the\r\nenactment of the Interstate Commerce Act in 1887, had conceded the\r\nwisdom of such an adjustment between local and long hauls. Nor were\r\nsuch statutes disregarded, as a rule. Thus, in Massachusetts they were\r\nenforced to the extreme degree of prohibiting any concession in rates\r\nat Provincetown, on the point of Cape Cod, one hundred and twenty miles\r\nfrom Boston by land, while only thirty-six miles in a direct line\r\nby water, below the rates at any of the intermediate points on the\r\nroundabout rail line along the Cape. The debates in Congress at the\r\ntime this section of the Act was under discussion show that the bill\r\nas finally passed was a compromise between an absolutely inflexible\r\nprohibition, in the House, and a more elastic measure, providing for\r\nexceptions, in the Senate.\r\n\r\nIn one respect the law of 1887 marks a profound revolution in both\r\ncommercial theory and practice. Its provisions concerning equality\r\nof rates to all classes of shippers denote a great moral uplift in\r\nthe business standards of the country. Prior to this time the English\r\ncommon law, while requiring reasonableness of charges by common\r\ncarriers, by no means insured that such charges should be stable and\r\nuniform. This flowed perhaps from the circumstance that rebating was an\r\nessentially American abuse. Neither in England, nor on the continent\r\nfor that matter, had business rivals ever made such use of the services\r\nof carriers to suppress fair competition in trade. With us, on the\r\nother hand, in the early free-and-easy days, entire freedom of contract\r\nbetween shipper and carrier had been the rule. Published tariffs were\r\nonly the starting point for \"higgle\" and \"dicker.\" It was not bad form\r\nfor a shipper to \"go shopping\" freely among the freight agents of\r\ncompeting lines. The location of new enterprises, new opportunities for\r\nthe expansion of old ones, were all more or less conditioned by the\r\nspecial favors which were so readily obtainable on demand. Nor was the\r\naccompaniment of secrecy necessarily due to fear of moral condemnation\r\nby the community. Secrecy was an economic essential of the device, as\r\nhas elsewhere been shown.[546] By this new statute all was suddenly\r\nchanged. Rebating was made a crime, punishable as such. Is it any\r\nwonder that, almost from the outset and for nearly fifteen years, this\r\npart of the law was the storm centre of litigation; and that in respect\r\nof rebating, the need of supplementary legislation should first become\r\napparent?\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[521] The following references are best:--1866.

The Commission reports in 1888 that the railroads \"conformed\r\npromptly\" to their orders; although in the South and West they were\r\n\"moving more slowly.\" On the other hand, the new Commission under the\r\nleadership of Judge Cooley, an able jurist trusted by all parties\r\nconcerned, was equally conciliatory in spirit. Many desirable changes\r\nwere brought about in railway practice. Attempts were made to remodel\r\ntariffs all over the country, particularly in the East, to conform to\r\nthe long and short haul clause.[548]\r\n\r\nThe immediate effect of acquiescence in Section 4 was to compel, in\r\nmany parts of the country, a reduction of the local rates in order\r\nto reduce them below the rates charged to terminal and competitive\r\npoints. Thus, for example, throughout trunk line territory, they\r\nwere almost uniformly adjusted to meet this requirement. Even in the\r\nsouthern states, where in some quarters the most persistent opposition\r\nto the law has from the first existed, there was a patent disposition\r\nshown to recognize the justice of such legislation. The Southern\r\nRailroad modified its tariff all along the line as far as Atlanta,\r\nalthough it claimed inability to make changes beyond that point. For\r\nnearly three years, in fact, the carriers conformed in an increasing\r\ndegree to this requirement of the law.[549] A sincere effort toward\r\nuniform classification of freight, with substantial results in the\r\ndirection of simplification of schedules, extended over several\r\nyears. Many pools were disbanded; all were reorganized in conformity\r\nwith the statute. And in the matter of uniformity and publicity of\r\nstatistical returns, friendly coöperation between the railroads and the\r\nCommission, brought about great improvements in accounting practice.\r\nNo considerable popular interest in the new commercial tribunal, to\r\nbe sure, is indicated by the volume of its business. After five years\r\nexperience, only thirty-nine formal complaints were filed in 1892. But\r\nthis may have been due in part to the natural hesitancy of shippers\r\nto antagonizing the roads by coming out into the open with their\r\ngrievances. Or, perhaps, it was merely because the people at large were\r\nas yet quite unfamiliar with the law and with the ease of procedure\r\nunder it.\r\n\r\nThe earliest intimation of determined resistance by the carriers came\r\nin connection with prosecutions for rebating in 1890. This abuse was\r\nstill widely prevalent. The Commission complained in that year of the\r\n\"general disregard\" of the law against personal discrimination; and\r\nset out to prosecute with vigor. But witnesses called upon to testify\r\nbefore grand juries as to such practices, proved recalcitrant.[550]\r\nCorporations could be made amenable to the law only through the\r\ninstrumentality of persons in their employ. And guilt in such matters\r\ncould be detected only by the testimony of those who had directly\r\nwitnessed, or participated in, the unlawful acts themselves. As one\r\nwriter has put it, \"Rebate contracts are not usually negotiated before\r\nlarge audiences nor are rebate payments commonly made upon street\r\ncorners. An essential element in these practices, quite aside from\r\ntheir legality, is the secrecy with which they are conducted.\" It soon\r\nbecame apparent that unless this mantle of secrecy could be stripped\r\noff in preliminary proceedings, not even indictments could be had,--to\r\nsay nothing of the proof needed for subsequent conviction.\r\n\r\nThe first ground for contesting the right of the government to\r\nextort testimony from unwilling witnesses arose, oddly enough, from\r\nan amendment of the law intended to increase its effectiveness.\r\nOriginally punishable only by heavy fine, on recommendation of the\r\nCommission, Congress added in 1889 an amendment whereby departure from\r\nthe published rate was made punishable also by imprisonment. By this\r\nchange criminal, as well as civil, procedure was thus brought into\r\nplay. The amendment, moreover, extended the punishment to shippers; the\r\nrailroad official who gave rebates having alone been liable hitherto.\r\nAn unexpected result speedily followed. In 1890 one Counselman, a\r\nshipper, questioned concerning his enjoyment of less than the open rate\r\nupon grain, declined to answer, taking refuge under the Fifth Amendment\r\nto the Constitution of the United States. This declared that \"no\r\nperson ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness\r\nagainst himself.\" The witness persisted in his refusal to testify\r\neven before a district judge: and the case went on appeal through the\r\nCircuit Court which decided in favor of the Commission, up to the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States. This tribunal in 1892 held that\r\nthe Revised Statutes of the United States which for twenty-five years\r\nhad been held to protect the constitutional rights of witnesses when\r\ncalled upon to give testimony, against criminal proceedings based upon\r\nsuch evidence, did not in fact adequately afford such protection.\r\nCounselman was ordered discharged from the custody of the United\r\nStates Marshal. It was held, furthermore, \"that a statutory enactment\r\nto be valid, must afford absolute immunity for the offence to which\r\nthe question relates.\"[551] Congress promptly passed a law to this\r\neffect in the following year. The matter did not, however, rest here.\r\nThe validity of this later statute had now to be upheld. And, with\r\ndiscouraging defeat in 1894 in an Illinois Circuit Court, the issue had\r\nto be raised again a year later elsewhere, to be then carried on appeal\r\na second time to the Supreme Court. This took place in the so-called\r\nBrown case.[552] The final outcome in 1896 was a complete denial of the\r\nright of witnesses to withhold material testimony. But it required six\r\nyears of litigation to bring about the desired result.\r\n\r\nDuring the pendency of the proceedings above described, a second line\r\nof resistance to the government developed. Not the merely negative\r\npersonal right of witnesses to withhold testimony, but the positive\r\nlegal authority of the Commission to exact it, was called in question.\r\nThis struck at the very roots of all procedure. For it challenged the\r\nvalidity of the Act itself. In how far might an administrative body,\r\nindependently, have power, hitherto resident alone in the courts and\r\nCongress, to compel the attendance and testimony of witnesses as well\r\nas the production of papers? Section 12 of the Act was evidently\r\nintended to confer such powers as were possessed and might be delegated\r\nby the Congress. But then there was the Constitution again to be\r\nconsidered! Certain witnesses declined to produce books and answer\r\nquestions in 1892. One Brimson was selected for a test case. The first\r\ndecision by the Circuit Court held these sections of the statute to be\r\nunconstitutional on the ground that \"Congress cannot make the judicial\r\ndepartment the mere adjunct or instrument of the other departments.\"\r\nBut the Supreme Court of the United States in 1894 reversed this\r\njudgment; and, unreservedly, although by a bare majority opinion,\r\naffirmed the constitutionality of the procedure under the Act.[553]\r\nThis Brimson opinion, together with the Brown decision two years\r\nlater, were confidently believed to have so strengthened the arm of\r\nthe government that rebating might at last be eliminated. But, as will\r\nshortly appear, an entirely new law was yet needed to eradicate the\r\nevil. For the moment, however, the right of Congress to legislate and\r\nof the Commission to act, had been upheld.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe relation of the Interstate Commerce Commission as an administrative\r\nbody to the Federal courts under the provisions of the Act of 1887,\r\nproved unsatisfactory from the first. In order to understand the\r\nsituation, it may be well to review the ordinary procedure. Formal\r\ncomplaint having been filed, the Commission heard the case and\r\npromulgated its decision in the form of an order to the carriers. If\r\nthey chose to comply with it, well and good. Otherwise, the Commission\r\nmust apply to a Federal court for the issuance of a judicial writ to\r\ncompel obedience to the order. Thereupon the court proceeded to review\r\nthe case; and upon the findings to issue an order of its own. From this\r\norder, however, appeal might be taken even up to the Supreme Court.\r\nThen, and then only, did the original mandate of the Commission have\r\nthe force of law. Practically, two results followed, as shown by the\r\nexperience of the succeeding years. There was intolerable delay in\r\nthe redress of grievances; and, in the second place, all definitive\r\nproceedings were postponed until the case had gone on appeal to the\r\ncourts. In other words the Commission instead of being a coördinate\r\nbody with the courts, was reduced to an entirely subordinate position.\r\nIts function became merely to institute proceedings, and thereafter\r\nto appear as a complainant before other tribunals competent alone\r\nto decide the case. Intolerable delay in procedure was the constant\r\ncomplaint of shippers. Years elapsed before final judgments were\r\nrendered. The average duration of cases appealed was not less than four\r\nyears. Sometimes they extended over twice that period. Often, as in\r\nthe Charleston, S. C., case in 1898, several years elapsed before the\r\nCommission itself rendered a decision. Knotty cases were sidetracked.\r\n\r\nBut the main source of delay was in the carriage of cases on appeal up\r\nto the Supreme Court of the United States. They had to await their turn\r\nin regular order, being given no priority on the crowded dockets. The\r\nSocial Circle and Import Rate cases, soon to be discussed, consumed\r\nfive years in litigation, even after the Commission had rendered its\r\nopinion. The Florida Fruit Exchange case involving rates on oranges,\r\noriginally decided by the Commission in 1891, was for six years\r\nthereafter before the Federal Courts. The Georgia Railroad Commission\r\ncases were not settled for nine years. Nor did the tedious process end\r\nhere. After the judicial review, which usually covered the law points,\r\nthe entire question had to be remanded to the Commission for a new\r\norder in conformity with the findings of the court. After nine years\r\nof litigation in the Chattanooga case, back it went to the Commission\r\nto be re-tried after consideration of other commercial factors. First\r\ndecided in 1892, it was reopened in 1904.[554] Is it any wonder that\r\nthe number of formal proceedings instituted on complaint of shippers\r\nsteadily dwindled year by year? In 1901 only nineteen petitions were\r\nfiled. Business of this sort was almost at a standstill.\r\n\r\nA second unsatisfactory feature of the relations of the Commission to\r\nthe courts, lay in the refusal of the latter to accept the evidence\r\ntaken before the Commission in the original proceedings as final.\r\nTrouble began in 1888 on the first appeal, known as the Kentucky\r\nand Indiana Bridge case.[555] The court treated it as an original\r\nproceeding, even as to questions of fact; and proceeded to consider\r\nit _de novo_. This of course involved a duplication of all expenses;\r\nwhich, in causes sufficiently important to appeal, were very heavy. Ten\r\nvolumes of typewritten testimony, each as large as the Congressional\r\nRecord, were taken, for instance, in the San Bernardino case.[556]\r\nBoth shipper and railroad, therefore, commonly came to regard the\r\nproceedings before the Commission as merely a necessary formality to\r\nbe observed prior to the conclusive adjudication of the matter by the\r\ncourts. This placed the Commission in a most awkward predicament. It\r\nwas compelled by law to render a decision upon an entirely imperfect\r\npresentation of facts. And this decision was thereafter liable to\r\nbe reviewed upon the basis of entirely new testimony. Thus in the\r\nleading Alabama Midland case, involving the reasonableness of rates\r\nto Troy, Alabama, as compared with adjacent towns, much depended upon\r\nthe existence of effective competition with the railroads from boat\r\nlines on the rivers at other places.[557] Before the Commission the\r\nevidence adduced by the carriers dwelt upon the navigability of the\r\nChattahoochee river as compelling lower rates at Columbus and Eufaula\r\nthan at Troy, an inland town. Yet, when the case was really opened up\r\nin appeal proceedings, it appeared that this magnificent waterway was\r\nreally dry about half the year; that the channel was never deeper than\r\nthree feet; and that boats were at all times of the year \"embarrassed\r\nby the overhanging trees.\" How could the Commission be expected to\r\npass upon vital questions wisely under such circumstances? Whether\r\nwilfully done or not,--and evidence is not lacking of a deliberate\r\npolicy adopted in some cases,--the inevitable effect was to bring\r\nthe Commission and the law itself into discredit. So accentuated did\r\nthis evil become, that in the Social Circle case the Supreme Court\r\ndistinctly discountenanced the practice, declaring it to be the\r\nintention of the law that all material facts should be disclosed in\r\nthe original proceedings.[558] But it was not until 1906 that the mode\r\nof procedure on appeal was by statute clearly defined. In the meantime\r\npublic interest in the work of the Commission was bound to wane.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it may not be out of place to refer to the\r\npersistent use made of the record of the Commission in court\r\nproceedings under these adverse circumstances, as a plausible argument\r\nby the railroads in later years against any augmentation of its powers.\r\nOne brief, for example, recites that \"since 1887, forty-three suits\r\nhave been instituted to enforce final orders of the Commission as to\r\nrates. The net result of the action of the courts shows two affirmances\r\nand thirty reversals.\" It continues later, \"as over ninety per cent. of\r\nthe Commission's orders as to rates which have gone before the courts\r\nhave been overruled, it is impossible to foretell what havoc would\r\nfollow from the exercise of such powers.\" This statement is entirely\r\ntrue, but it is not the entire truth. We may profitably consider\r\nthe cases of sufficient importance to have been passed upon by the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States. Between 1887 and 1905, sixteen\r\nsuch decisions were rendered on cases appealed for enforcement by the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission. Fifteen of these were decided in favor\r\nof the carriers, while only one sustained in part the contention of the\r\nCommission. At first sight, this record certainly appears to warrant\r\nthe condemnation of the Commission. A body so persistently on the wrong\r\nside of great questions as this record indicates, would surely invite\r\ndistrust. There were two answers to this contention, however, which\r\nmerit consideration before a final judgment can be rendered. One of\r\nthese was the irregularity of procedure, above described. The other\r\nwas that these court cases had nearly all involved, not so much the\r\nadministrative application of the law to economic abuses, as the purely\r\njudicial interpretation of the law itself.\r\n\r\nOnly by means of concrete cases decided by the Commission as an\r\nadministrative body, could the scope and meaning of the original law\r\nbe determined. This was a most difficult task hinging upon the utmost\r\nlegal technicalities and refinements. Even the most learned judges\r\nfailed to agree among themselves. Thus in eight of the sixteen cases\r\nabove mentioned, the decisions in the lower Federal courts failed of\r\nagreement with the final decree of the Supreme Court. In the Cartage\r\ncase,--involving the legality of a railway giving one shipper free\r\ncartage of goods to a railway station as an inducement to ship over its\r\nline, while withholding the privilege from another,--the Commission\r\nwas sustained in the Circuit Court and reversed in the two higher\r\ntribunals. In other instances, like the Social Circle case,--turning\r\nupon the discrimination in freight rates against small towns in favor\r\nof large competitive centres,--the first court ruled adversely, while\r\nthe Circuit Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court sustained the\r\nCommission in part. Or yet again, as in the Chattanooga case,--wherein\r\nthis city complained against a higher freight rate from New York than\r\nthe rival city of Nashville enjoyed, although the goods for Nashville\r\npassed through Chattanooga and were hauled one hundred and fifty-one\r\nmiles further,--both lower tribunals sustained the Commission only to\r\nbe finally overruled by the Supreme Court. The fact that in only eight\r\nof these most important cases the courts could agree among themselves\r\nindicates the nicety of the legal issues comprehended. All parties\r\nwere in fact working much in the dark, both as to the intention of the\r\noriginal law and as to the possible effects of its interpretation. The\r\ncharge of incompetence, if it held good for the Commission, applied\r\nequally well to a large number of the most learned judges in the\r\nFederal courts.\r\n\r\nAnother indication of the extreme delicacy of the legal issues\r\ninvolved, is found in the lack of unanimity even among the justices of\r\nthe Supreme Court itself. In nine of the sixteen Supreme Court cases\r\nthe final decision was not rendered without dissent. As the lower\r\ncourts were divided among themselves, so the justices of the Supreme\r\nCourt were apparently somewhat at sea. The minority, to be sure, was\r\nsmall, in most cases being due to the failure of Justice Harlan to\r\nconcur. But in the far-reaching Import Rates case,[559] the court was\r\nmore evenly divided. The issue raised, concerned the legality of lower\r\nthrough rates on imports from Liverpool to San Francisco _via_ New\r\nOrleans, than were granted on domestic shipments from New Orleans to\r\nthe same destination. Thus the rate on books, buttons, and hosiery,\r\nfrom Liverpool to San Francisco through New Orleans was $1.07 per\r\nhundred pounds. At the same time the domestic shipper was compelled\r\nto pay $2.88, or two and one-half times as much, for a haul from\r\nNew Orleans to San Francisco alone. In another important instance,\r\ntin plate was carried from Liverpool by steamer and rail through\r\nPhiladelphia to Chicago for twenty-four cents per hundred pounds. For\r\nthe American merchant in Philadelphia the rate to the same market was\r\ntwenty-six cents. For the inland haul alone the Pennsylvania Railroad\r\nwas receiving sixteen cents on the foreign goods, while coincidently\r\ncharging American merchants ten cents more for the same service.\r\nDiscrimination against the American merchant in favor of foreign\r\ncompetition, not infrequently more than sufficient to overbalance any\r\nsupposed protection afforded by the tariff, has been repeatedly proved\r\nin such cases as this. The duty on imported cement was eight cents per\r\nhundredweight. In one instance, this duty with the total freight rate\r\nadded amounted to only eighteen cents, as against a rate of twenty\r\ncents for the domestic producer from New York to the same point. There\r\nwere reasons for this grievous discrimination against the domestic\r\nshipper, mainly concerned with the vagaries of ocean freight rates.\r\nSteamers must have ballast for the return trip to equalize out-going\r\nshipments of grain and other exports, and they will carry heavy\r\ncommodities, such as salt, cement, crockery, and glass, at extremely\r\nlow rates. Nevertheless, such imported commodities can be sold to\r\nadvantage in competition with domestic goods only when the railways\r\nwill contribute equally low rates to complete the shipment.\r\n\r\nThe Interstate Commerce Commission in these Import Rate cases\r\noriginally held that such discriminations were unlawful. Two\r\nappellate courts, in turn, sustained this view. Finally, however,\r\nthe Supreme Court decided, with three members, including the Chief\r\nJustice, dissenting, that the Interstate Commerce Law as phrased\r\ndid not expressly prohibit the practice. Everything turned upon the\r\ninterpretation of certain clauses in the law. No question was ever\r\nraised as to the economic issues involved, nor was it competent to\r\nthese tribunals to pass upon such issues. The question was simply and\r\nsolely this: When the Act to Regulate Commerce forbade inequality or\r\ndiscrimination between shippers, did it contemplate competition between\r\nshipments originating within the country and others from foreign ports?\r\nWas the Interstate Commerce Commission, in other words, empowered,\r\nin interpreting this act, to consider circumstances and conditions\r\n_without_ as well as _within_ the boundaries of the United States?\r\nIf it was entitled to consider solely domestic conditions, it was\r\ncertainly right and economically sound in forbidding such practices;\r\nif, on the other hand, it was required to take account of commercial\r\nconditions the world over, irrespective of the effect upon the domestic\r\nproducer and internal trade, its decision should have been favorable\r\nto the railroads. To appreciate fully the extreme nicety of the legal\r\npoints involved and the delicacy of the economic interests at issue,\r\none must needs read the extended opinions both of the majority of the\r\nSupreme Court and of the three dissenting justices, including Chief\r\nJustice Fuller. But to interpret the reversal of the original decision\r\nof the Interstate Commerce Commission by this tribunal as in the\r\nslightest degree involving incompetence or judicial unfairness is a\r\nmisrepresentation of all the facts involved. As in the preceding cases\r\ntouching the interpretation of the long and short haul clause, it may\r\nfairly be said that the consensus of opinion among business men, and\r\ncertainly among the professional economists of the country, was on the\r\nside of the Commission in condemning such practices. As to the law,\r\nthat was decided otherwise by a narrow majority.\r\n\r\nThe final breakdown of the law of 1887 came, however, not from mere\r\ndefects in procedure, but from the adverse construction placed by the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States upon its fundamental clauses, viz.,\r\nthose concerning the exercise of rate-making power by the Commission.\r\nWhether or not it was the intention of Congress to delegate such power,\r\nseems not to have been considered for some years. At all events,\r\nwithin two months after the law was passed the Commission certainly\r\ninterpreted the law as giving it, not only power to investigate but to\r\nprescribe remedies for what it conceived to be unreasonable charges.\r\nThe right to exercise general rate-making power in first instance was\r\ndistinctly disclaimed.[560] But the right to prescribe a modification\r\nof existing rates on complaint was repeatedly affirmed, without\r\nquestion either by the carriers or the Federal courts.[561] The first\r\norder of the commission in _Evans vs. The Oregon Navigation Company_\r\ndirected a reduction of the rate on wheat from Walla Walla, Washington,\r\nto Portland, Ore., from thirty to twenty-three and one-half cents.\r\nIt was promptly complied with. Then came the Farmington-Red Wing,\r\nMinn., wheat case, touching not absolute but relative rates between\r\ntwo competing places. The order that the charge to one town should not\r\nexceed that to the other by more than one-third was likewise obeyed.\r\nEven freight classification, not specifically mentioned in the Act, was\r\nsupposed to be fully subject to the Commission's control.\r\n\r\nIn the Reynolds case, railroad ties and lumber were ordered to be\r\ngrouped together, without contest. The activity of the Commission at\r\nthis time in promoting uniform classification elsewhere discussed,[562]\r\nwas evidently based upon a similar belief in its legal competency to\r\nact. For nearly a decade attention seems to have been so concentrated\r\nupon matters of judicial procedure, that this more fundamental\r\nproposition was neglected. Moreover, all this time was needed to secure\r\na final pronouncement from the Supreme Court, which was alone competent\r\nto settle it as a matter of law.\r\n\r\nIt was not, then, until almost ten years after the institution of the\r\nCommission, in fact, that its rate-making power was denied. The first\r\nshadow of doubt seems to have been expressed in the decision of the\r\nSupreme Court in the so-called Social Circle case.[563] This involved\r\nthe reasonableness of rates from Cincinnati to the town of Social\r\nCircle, Georgia, as related to the rates to Atlanta and Augusta on\r\neither side. Disregarding other phases of the case which concerned\r\nthe interpretation of the long and short haul clause, the Commission\r\nhad, when the case was first decided in 1891, ordered a reduction\r\nof the rate from Cincinnati to Atlanta from $1.09 to $1 per hundred\r\npounds. This case was carried to the Supreme Court, where decision\r\nwas finally rendered in 1896. Purely as an _obiter dictum_ the court\r\ndiscussed briefly the interpretation of the original act in respect to\r\nrate-making power. It expressed a reasonable doubt in the premises,\r\neven going further and confessing inability to find any provision\r\nof the act \"that expressly or by necessary implication confers such\r\npowers.\" It does not seem clear whether by this statement the court\r\nhad reference to the arbitrary prescription of rates in first instance\r\nto the carriers, or merely to action of the Commission in prescribing\r\nrates after complaint, in order to redress grievances.\r\n\r\nSeveral decisions of circuit courts during 1896 reënforced the judicial\r\ndoubt as to the validity of the rate-making power of the Commission.\r\nThus, for example, in the case of Coxe Brothers,[564] involving rates\r\nupon anthracite coal, which, by the way, had been pending since 1891,\r\nthe Circuit Court of Appeals expressly declined to enforce an order\r\nof the Commission, stating that it \"is not clothed with the power to\r\nfix rates which it undertook to exercise in this case.\" The court's\r\nreasoning in the Social Circle case was followed and expressly cited.\r\nDuring the same year, 1896, other cases, such as that of the Truck\r\nFarmers' Association, were decided in the same spirit. The final\r\nadjudication of this point, however, was reserved for the decision\r\nin the so-called Cincinnati Freight Bureau case. This had its origin\r\nin an application from the Commission to enforce an order issued in\r\n1894 against the Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific Railroad\r\nCompany.[565] The case involved the adjustment of rates from eastern\r\nand western centres, respectively, into the southern states; and the\r\nCommission had decided that a reduction of the rates from the western\r\ncities was reasonable and necessary. This leading case, also known as\r\nthe Maximum Freight Rate decision of 1897, is characterized by the\r\nCommission itself as perhaps \"the most important since the enactment of\r\nthe Act to Regulate Commerce.\" It merits consideration in some detail.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning in the Maximum Freight Rate case[566] cannot be better\r\nput than by the following excerpts from the opinion of the Supreme\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\n    \"It is one thing to inquire whether the rates which have been\r\n    charged and collected are reasonable,--that is a judicial act;\r\n    but an entirely different thing to prescribe rates which shall\r\n    be charged in the future,--that is a legislative act.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"We have, therefore, these considerations presented: First.\r\n    The power to prescribe a tariff of rates for carriage by a\r\n    common carrier is a legislative, and not an administrative or\r\n    judicial, function, and, having respect to the large amount of\r\n    property invested in railroads, the various companies engaged\r\n    therein, the thousands of miles of road, and the millions of\r\n    tons of freight carried, the varying and diverse conditions\r\n    attaching to such carriage, is a power of supreme delicacy\r\n    and importance. Second. That Congress has transferred such\r\n    a power to any administrative body is not to be presumed or\r\n    implied from any doubtful and uncertain language. The words\r\n    and phrases efficacious to make such a delegation of power\r\n    are well understood, and have been frequently used, and, if\r\n    Congress has intended to grant such a power to the Interstate\r\n    Commerce Commission, it cannot be doubted that it would have\r\n    used language open to no misconstruction, but clear and direct.\r\n    Third. Incorporating into a statute the common-law obligation\r\n    resting upon the carrier to make all its charges reasonable\r\n    and just, and directing the commission to execute and enforce\r\n    the provisions of the act, does not by implication carry to\r\n    the commission, or invest it with the power to exercise, the\r\n    legislative function of prescribing rates which shall control\r\n    in the future. Fourth. Beyond the inference which irresistibly\r\n    follows from the omission to grant in express terms to the\r\n    commission this power of fixing rates is the clear language of\r\n    section 6, recognizing the right of the carrier to establish\r\n    rates, to increase or reduce them, and prescribing the\r\n    conditions upon which such increase or reduction may be made,\r\n    and requiring, as the only conditions of its action--First,\r\n    publication; and, Second, the filing of the tariff with the\r\n    commission. The grant to the commission of the power to\r\n    prescribe the form of the schedules, and to direct the place\r\n    and manner of publication of joint rates, thus specifying the\r\n    scope and limit of its functions in this respect, strengthens\r\n    the conclusion that the power to prescribe rates or fix any\r\n    tariff for the future is not among the powers granted to the\r\n    commission.\r\n\r\n    \"These considerations convince us that under the interstate\r\n    commerce act the commission has no power to prescribe the\r\n    tariff of rates which shall control in the future, and\r\n    therefore cannot invoke a judgment in mandamus from the courts\r\n    to enforce any such tariff by it prescribed.\"\r\n\r\nThe immediate effect of this decision was to put an end to any\r\nenforcement of decisions relative to rates by the Commission. The\r\ncarriers immediately refused to obey any orders which the Commission\r\nissued for the redress of grievances. This policy was manifested with\r\nincreasing clearness during the five years subsequent to the decision.\r\nIt became more and more certain that the denial of the right, not\r\nonly to pass upon the reasonableness of a particular rate, but to\r\nprescribe what rate should supersede it, meant the abolition of all\r\ncontrol whatever over the scale of charges. The entire inadequacy of\r\nmaking rate regulation dependent upon the mere determination of rates\r\nas applied _in the past_, without reference to the rates which should\r\nprevail _in the future_, was apparent on all sides. More than this,\r\nall remedy for the parties who had borne the burden of an unreasonable\r\nrate would seem to have been removed. This was clearly described in\r\nthe report of the Commission for 1897. It was illustrated by the rates\r\nupon oranges. In 1890 there had been a sudden advance on rates from\r\nFlorida to New York from thirty to forty cents. The Commission after\r\ninvestigation ordered that the rate be reduced to thirty-five cents.\r\nAs a matter of fact, how could this action redress grievances of those\r\nwho had already paid forty cents per box? It was difficult in the first\r\nplace to discover who bore the burden of the unreasonable charge; and\r\nin the second place it was certain that some of those who suffered\r\ncould not legally sue in court. The actual shipper who alone could sue\r\nfor repayment of unreasonable charges was a middleman who recouped\r\nhimself in any event, either from the grower, the consumer, or both.\r\nHe lost nothing by reason of the unreasonable rate. As a matter of\r\nfact, not any single individual but the locality, had been mulcted by\r\nfive cents per hundred pounds, supposing that a rate of forty cents\r\nwere unreasonable. Experience showed that almost no shippers or other\r\nparties injured, actually attempted to secure the restitution of moneys\r\nalready paid for unreasonable charges. In only five out of 225 cases\r\ndown to 1897 was a refund actually sought; and in those cases $100 was\r\nthe maximum sought to be recovered. As a matter of fact the damage\r\ninflicted by the existence of such an unreasonable rate could not be\r\nmeasured by hundreds or perhaps by hundreds of thousands of dollars.\r\nThe bearing of this citation is to show that any effectual protection\r\nto the shipper must proceed from adjudication of the reasonableness\r\nof rates _before_, and not _after_, they have been paid; that is\r\nto say, in advance of their exaction by the carrier. Power to pass\r\nupon the reasonableness of such rates prior to their enforcement, as\r\na consequence, constitutes practically the only safeguard which the\r\nshipping public may enjoy. It will be observed that in this discussion\r\nreference is made simply and solely to that class of cases where\r\ncomplaint is made against the unreasonableness of a rate _per se_ as\r\napplied to all shippers alike, entirely distinct from the exercise of\r\npowers by the Commission in respect of unreasonable discrimination as\r\nbetween two or more persons or places. That other question of relative\r\nrates was to come up in another connection.\r\n\r\nDespite this denial by the Maximum Freight Rate decision of power\r\nto prescribe future rates, in substitution for others held to be\r\nunreasonable, there were still certain things which the Commission\r\nmight do in the matter of rate determination. The only question was\r\nas to whether they afforded an adequate remedy for the redress of\r\ngrievances. Were they really worth while? Complaint as to a rate,\r\nonce paid, might still be made. The Commission might still hold it\r\nunreasonable; and even pass upon the degree of its unreasonableness.\r\nAnd the complainant shipper might then institute proceedings for\r\nrepayment of the excessive charges under that particular rate. But\r\nthe difference between this range of powers and those which had been\r\nclaimed by the Commission for ten years was simply this: That under the\r\noriginal interpretation of the law the Commission had not only decided\r\nwhether rates were wrong; it had also prescribed a remedy by issuing\r\nan order as to what rates were right, believing that these would be\r\nenforced by the courts. Not even the power to prescribe maximum rates\r\nremained to the Commission after this interpretation. The only action\r\nopen to it would be to declare one rate after another unreasonable\r\nuntil the carriers had been brought to terms. Its inadequacy as a\r\npractical remedy was the main factor in bringing about the passage of\r\nthe new law of 1906.\r\n\r\nIt must not be assumed that the Supreme Court in the Maximum Freight\r\nRate decision intended to render the Commission an entirely superfluous\r\nbody. But its functions, as set forth in the following quotation from\r\nthe opinion, proclaimed the adoption of an entirely different policy\r\nconcerning public control of rates from the one hitherto pursued.\r\nWhether it was adequate for the purpose in view will appear, as has\r\njust been observed, from the subsequent course of events.\r\n\r\n    \"But has the commission no functions to perform in respect to\r\n    the matter of rates, no power to make any inquiry in respect\r\n    thereto? Unquestionably it has, and most important duties\r\n    in respect to this matter. It is charged with the general\r\n    duty of inquiring as to the management of the business of\r\n    railroad companies, and to keep itself informed as to the\r\n    manner in which the same is conducted, and has the right to\r\n    compel complete and full information as to the manner in which\r\n    such carriers are transacting their business. And, with this\r\n    knowledge, it is charged with the duty of seeing that there is\r\n    no violation of the long and short haul clause; that there is\r\n    no discrimination between individual shippers, and that nothing\r\n    is done, by rebate or any other device, to give preference to\r\n    one as against another; that no undue preferences are given to\r\n    one place or places or individual or class of individuals, but\r\n    that in all things that equality of right, which is the great\r\n    purpose of the interstate commerce act, shall be secured to\r\n    all shippers. It must also see that that publicity which is\r\n    required by section 6 is observed by the railroad companies.\r\n    Holding the railroad companies to strict compliance with all\r\n    these statutory provisions, and enforcing obedience to all\r\n    these provisions, tends ... to both reasonableness and equality\r\n    of rate, as contemplated by the interstate commerce act.\"\r\n\r\nThe nadir of government regulation for the time being was reached in\r\nNovember, 1897,--six months after the Maximum Freight Rate decision.\r\nA second opinion from the Supreme Court of the United States in the\r\nAlabama Midland (Troy) case, with one blow practically nullified the\r\nlong and short haul clause.[567] The first opinion had put an end\r\nto control over the reasonableness of rates in and of themselves.\r\nThis second one denied the right to establish their reasonableness\r\n_relatively_ as between competing places or markets. In order fully\r\nto appreciate the significance of this decision it will be necessary\r\nto review cursorily the tedious litigation which led up to this\r\nresult,--the entire emasculation of the Fourth section. The final\r\noutcome may be best described by Justice Harlan in his dissenting\r\nopinion in this leading case:\r\n\r\n    \"Taken in connection with other decisions defining the powers\r\n    of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the present decision, it\r\n    seems to me, goes far to make that commission a useless body\r\n    for all practical purposes, and to defeat many of the important\r\n    objects designed to be accomplished by the various enactments\r\n    of Congress relating to interstate commerce. The Commission\r\n    was established to protect the public against the improper\r\n    practices of transportation companies engaged in commerce among\r\n    the several States. It has been left, it is true, with power\r\n    to make reports, and to issue protests. But it has been shorn,\r\n    by judicial interpretation, of authority to do anything of an\r\n    effective character.\"\r\n\r\nThe interpretation of the long and short haul clause[568] as applied\r\nto concrete cases by the Interstate Commerce Commission, was first\r\nenunciated in the decision known as the Louisville & Nashville\r\ncase.[569] Immediately after the enactment of the law, a multitude\r\nof petitions were received from carriers all over the country\r\npraying that they be exempted from the operation of this clause,\r\nwhich prohibited a greater charge for a lesser haul than for one\r\nover the same line between points more distant. The policy outlined\r\nin the Louisville & Nashville case, delivered by Judge Cooley, has\r\npractically remained unchanged to the present time. This railroad\r\ncompany operating a line parallel to the Mississippi, as well as\r\nintersected at various points by its tributary rivers, claimed that\r\nthe existence of water competition compelled a rate to all competitive\r\npoints, lower than rates which could be made to local and intermediate\r\nstations. It alleged that an adjustment of its local rates to the\r\nlow level necessitated at competitive points, would prove disastrous\r\nfrom the point of view of revenue. The point at issue was as to the\r\ninterpretation of the phrase \"under substantially similar circumstances\r\nand conditions\"; which, in the words of the Act, was necessary in order\r\nthat the prohibition of the lesser charge for the longer haul should\r\nbecome operative. Without entering into the details of this decision,\r\nin the course of which the nature of railroad competition and of rate\r\nmaking were fully discussed, as well as the legislative history of this\r\nclause of the Act, it will suffice to note the conclusions. These were;\r\nfirstly, that the prohibition against a greater charge for a shorter\r\nthan for a longer distance over the same line in the same direction,\r\nthe shorter being included within the longer distance, was limited to\r\ncases in which the circumstances and conditions were substantially\r\nsimilar; secondly, that carriers might judge in the first instance as\r\nto the similarity or dissimilarity of circumstances; but, thirdly, that\r\nthis judgment was not final but was subject to review by the Commission\r\nand the courts. Perhaps the most important point, however, was the\r\ndetermination of the conditions which constituted such dissimilar\r\ncircumstances and conditions as entitled the carrier to charge less\r\nfor the longer than for the shorter haul. These conditions were the\r\nexistence of water competition; the existence of other railroads not\r\nsubject to the statute; and \"rare and peculiar\" cases of competition\r\nbetween railroads which were subject to the law. The Commission also\r\nheld as a guiding principle in the interpretation of this clause that\r\nno distinction would be recognized between local traffic and so-called\r\nthrough business; and also that the expense to the carrier involved\r\nwould not be recognized as a factor unless it happened to come under\r\nthe case already cited as \"rare and peculiar.\" Furthermore, the desire\r\nto encourage manufactures or to build up business or trade centres, was\r\nnot recognized as a competent reason for claiming exemption from the\r\nprohibition in the Act.\r\n\r\nThe leading decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission, above\r\nmentioned, was rendered in 1887. It was not until October of 1892 that\r\nthe first serious interference arose through judicial interpretation\r\nin the United States Courts. The first was the so-called \"separate and\r\nindependent line\" decision.[570] This case arose respecting a suit for\r\nthe repayment of $225 as overcharges on corn shipped by one Osborne\r\nfrom Scranton, Iowa, to Chicago. It was claimed that the charges\r\nwere unjust and unreasonable, inasmuch as they were in excess of\r\nrates charged from Blair, Nebraska, a point more remote from Chicago.\r\nThe United States Circuit Court of Appeals at St. Paul reversed the\r\ndecision of the lower court, holding that the lesser rate from Blair\r\nwith which the Scranton rate had been compared, was not a rate to\r\nChicago, but part of an agreed through rate to New York and other\r\neastern points. Under this interpretation, the aggregate charge for the\r\nlonger distance from Blair to New York was not less than the charge\r\nfor the shorter distance from Scranton to Chicago. To this point the\r\ndecision was in conformity with the previous interpretation by the\r\ncourts and the Commission; which had uniformly held that a portion of\r\na joint through rate cannot be compared with local or individual rates\r\nin the determination of what constitutes the rate for the shorter or\r\nthe longer haul. This decision went further, however, and therein\r\nprofoundly affected the subsequent interpretation of the law. It\r\nproceeded to define the word \"line\" as used in the Act, by holding\r\nthat the joint line formed by two roads is wholly independent of the\r\ntwo lines represented by the several roads taken separately and apart.\r\nInterpreted in this way, the decision held furthermore that the total\r\njoint rate over two roads, not being over the \"same line,\" might for\r\nanything in the fourth section of the Act, not only be as low but even\r\nlower than the local rate of either. The effect of this decision was\r\nobviously to permit a railroad to engage in traffic agreements for\r\nthrough carriage of freight; and by so doing, legally to become a line\r\nseparate and independent from the same physical property when engaged\r\nin the transportation of freight over its own line. Moreover, by every\r\ncontract for through carriage of freight with different carriers,\r\nthe road became a separate and independent line in the eyes of the\r\nlaw. As many lines could exist over one set of rails as there were\r\ntraffic agreements for through haulage of freight between its terminal\r\npoints.[571]\r\n\r\nThe apprehension of the Interstate Commerce Commission that this\r\ninterpretation of the word line might render the Fourth section of\r\nthe Act inoperative, was realized in the following year. Several\r\ndecisions not only adopted the _obiter dictum_ of the Osborne case,\r\nabove described, but proceeded to expand upon it. Thus, for example,\r\nin the Georgia Federal Court, a case arose involving rates from the\r\nNorth to Atlanta as compared with the higher rates to intermediate\r\npoints. The court held that traffic from Cincinnati to Augusta or\r\nAtlanta was carried over a different line than that which was used for\r\ntransportation to points intermediate between Atlanta and Augusta;\r\ninasmuch as the several carriers agreeing upon the joint rate as far as\r\nAtlanta from the North, were different.\r\n\r\nMoreover it held that the road from Atlanta to Augusta being wholly\r\nwithin the state of Georgia, might by making a local rate from Atlanta\r\nwhich was added to the through rate into Atlanta, constitute itself\r\nmerely a state road, and therefore be exempted from the prohibition of\r\nthe Act. Thus it appeared, to quote from the report of the Commission\r\nfor 1893, \"that in addition to the embarrassments proposed by the\r\noriginal 'line' decision, the very jurisdiction of the law itself is\r\ninvaded by the extension of the line theory indulged in by the Georgia\r\nFederal court.\"\r\n\r\nThe interpretation put upon the Fourth section of the Act by the\r\ndecision above cited, remained in force and largely nullified\r\napplication of the Act itself until 1896. The next important\r\ninterpretation came, in the decision by the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates in the so-called \"Social Circle\" case.[572] This decision fully\r\ndiscussed the interpretation placed upon the word \"line\" in the Act.\r\nThe rates involved were those on buggies from Cincinnati, Ohio, to\r\nSocial Circle, a local station between Augusta and Atlanta, Georgia.\r\nFollowing the practice of the carriers for some years, the Georgia\r\nRailroad Company, which alone served the town of Social Circle, had\r\nrequested its connections at Atlanta not to name through rates to\r\nthat place or any other local station on its road. The Circuit Court\r\nfollowing the line of argument already described, had held that under\r\nsuch circumstances the Georgia railroad was only a local carrier\r\nand not a party to a joint or common arrangement, which would make\r\nit subject to the control of the Federal Commission. The Supreme\r\nCourt reversed this opinion, however; and held that when goods are\r\nshipped on a through bill of lading, they constitute an interstate\r\ncarriage subject to Federal supervision and control. The court held\r\nfurther that this state road became part of a continuous line, not by\r\nconsolidation with other companies, but by a traffic arrangement for\r\ncontinuous carriage or shipment. The Supreme Court interpreted the\r\noriginal Osborne decision as merely affirming that a railroad company\r\ndoing business in one state could not be compelled to enter into any\r\nagreement with connecting carriers. For by so doing, it continued,\r\nthe carrier might be deprived of its rights and powers to make rates\r\non its own road. Viewed in this way a carrier might agree to form a\r\ncontinuous line for carrying foreign freight at a through rate without\r\nbeing prevented from charging ordinary local rates for state traffic.\r\nStripped of legal verbiage, this interpretation by the Supreme Court,\r\nvirtually overruled the previous decisions by lower courts, and\r\nrehabilitated the original interpretation of the word \"line\" by the\r\nCommission; namely, that when a continuous line for through traffic\r\nis formed by several railroads, the roads constituting that line and\r\nmaking use of it are merely parts of one through route and are not\r\nseparate lines. In short, not being able to constitute themselves as\r\nseparate lines by reason of traffic contracts, they must continue to\r\nconform their through charges to the rates which they have made upon\r\nlocal business. So far as the enforcement of the Fourth section was\r\nconcerned, therefore, developments to this point had upheld the law\r\nas originally passed.[573] It remained, however, for a separate and\r\ndistinct course of judicial interpretation to once more jeopardize both\r\nthe practical operation of the law and the power of the Commission.\r\n\r\nReverting to the original Louisville & Nashville decision in 1887, it\r\nwill appear that the Commission held at that time that competition\r\nbetween carriers subject to the Act, did not constitute such\r\ndissimilarity of circumstances and conditions as would justify the\r\ncarriers in making their long distance rates lower than the rates\r\nbetween intermediate points. The only exception recognized at that time\r\nwas to be found in certain \"rare and peculiar\" cases.[574] One of these\r\nwill suffice as an illustration. There are two routes by which traffic\r\nfrom Youngstown, Ohio, may reach the East. One is by way of Pittsburg\r\nand the Pennsylvania Railroad; the other by an outlet to the north, at\r\nAshtabula upon the Lake Shore and New York Central trunk lines. Between\r\nYoungstown, Ohio, and Pittsburg, two parallel lines exist, each having\r\nan interest in forwarding freight to the East by the two routes above\r\nmentioned. The peculiarity of the situation is that competitive traffic\r\nfor the East may leave Pittsburg in either direction. If it goes\r\naround by Youngstown, that place becomes an intermediate point between\r\nPittsburg and New York. If, on the other hand, it goes from Pittsburg\r\ndirectly east, Youngstown becomes not an intermediate point, but one\r\nmore remote than Pittsburg from New York. Inasmuch as the Pennsylvania\r\nroute from Pittsburg is the shorter, it makes the rate.[575] The\r\nother roundabout route is obliged to accede to this compelled rate or\r\nlose the business. The result is that the smaller indirect road is\r\nobliged to give a lower rate from Pittsburg round by way of Youngstown\r\nto New York than it gives to Youngstown itself. Any other course of\r\naction would deprive it of any participation in Pittsburg business.\r\nSuch, then, is one of those \"rare and peculiar\" cases under which\r\nthe Commission from the first recognized the necessity of exempting\r\ncarriers, even where all are subject to the Act, from the prohibition\r\nof charging less for a shorter than for a longer haul over the same\r\nline.\r\n\r\nThe carriers from the outset had made a determined effort to show\r\nthat the competition of carriers among themselves was sufficient to\r\nproduce that dissimilarity of circumstances and conditions which would\r\njustify exemption from the Act. This contention the Commission refused\r\nto recognize, and did so particularly in the important decisions of\r\n1892 known as the Georgia Railroad Commission cases.[576] These again,\r\nlike the Maximum Freight Rate case, involved rates from Cincinnati to\r\nvarious points throughout the South; and had reference particularly\r\nto the prevalent practice of granting low rates to certain important\r\ncentres known as basing points. In this decision the Commission\r\nre-affirmed the principles set forth in the Louisville & Nashville\r\ncase, except in one detail; namely, as to whether the carriers were\r\njustified in deciding for themselves in first instance whether a case\r\nof railroad competition was of that type already defined as \"rare and\r\npeculiar\" which would permit exemption from the long and short haul\r\nprohibition. Experience of five years had shown that the right of\r\ndecision in this respect had led to manifold abuses; inasmuch as a\r\nstrong disposition on the part of the carriers all over the country\r\nwas shown to interpret all cases of railroad competition, however\r\nsimple, as \"rare and peculiar.\" The Commission, therefore, proceeded\r\nto overrule its earlier decision; and denied the right on the part\r\nof carriers to determine for themselves as to what constituted\r\ndissimilarity of circumstances and conditions, affirming that that\r\nright was its own.\r\n\r\nAll of the foregoing judicial interpretation is secondary in importance\r\nto the final decision of the United States Supreme Court in 1897 in\r\nwhat is known as the Alabama Midland case.[577] This once and for all\r\noverruled the interpretation placed upon the law by the Commission,\r\nthat railroad competition did not constitute that dissimilarity of\r\ncircumstances and conditions which would entitle a carrier to exemption\r\nfrom the prohibitions of the statute. This case, like almost all the\r\nothers involving the interpretation of the Fourth section, arose upon\r\ncomplaint of a small town in the southern states that more important\r\ntrade centres were securing advantages in the matter of rates which\r\nwere denied to it. The Board of Trade of Troy, Alabama, complained that\r\nit was compelled to pay $3.22 a ton on phosphate rock from Florida\r\nand South Carolina points, whereas the rate to Montgomery, a longer\r\ndistance, was only $3.00 per ton. The rock was carried through Troy.\r\nIt was also complained that rates on cotton discriminated against Troy\r\nas compared with Montgomery and other points; and that, thirdly, rates\r\nfrom Baltimore and New York were higher to Troy than to Montgomery,\r\nwhich was fifty-two miles further away. The case was carried on appeal\r\nto the Supreme Court of the United States, where an opinion was handed\r\ndown in 1896. The gist of this decision was that competition, whether\r\nof trade centres or of railroads, must be recognized as a factor in the\r\ndetermination of the similarity of circumstances and conditions under\r\nwhich the Fourth section of the clause should be applied. In other\r\nwords, it recited that Montgomery being a larger place than Troy; and\r\nhaving been an important trade centre on a navigable river for many\r\nyears, it was competent to the railroads centering at Montgomery to\r\ndetermine in part for themselves whether the existence of effective\r\ncompetition would warrant them in granting lower rates to Montgomery\r\nthan to local stations like Troy. The court held, however, that such\r\ncompetition was only one of the elements which must be considered. It\r\ndid not define it as the dominating one. The railroads, nevertheless,\r\nseized upon this interpretation of the law at once, making use of it\r\nto justify whatever departure they pleased to make from the practice\r\noriginally contemplated in adjusting long and short haul charges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAfter the discouraging reverse in the Alabama Midland decision, which\r\nthe Commission interpreted to mean that if circumstances and conditions\r\nwere different at the more distant point, that fact, of itself, removed\r\nthe case from the inhibition of the Fourth section; certain inferior\r\nFederal court opinions somewhat modified this view.[578] The question\r\nas to whether the discrimination at bar was or was not justifiable, was\r\npermitted to be considered; in addition to inquiring merely whether\r\ncircumstances and conditions were different at the more distant point.\r\nThe Commission somewhat reanimated by these decisions, sought to\r\napply this judicial modification of the Alabama Midland reasoning to\r\nseveral then pending complaints as to local discrimination. Both in\r\nthe Danville[579] and Hampton cases[580] the carriers were ordered\r\nto desist from discriminating against the nearer point under this\r\ninterpretation of the law. But the Supreme Court put an end to it all\r\nby condemning this line of reasoning in its last leading decision upon\r\nthe Fourth section rendered in 1901, finally disposing of the so-called\r\nChattanooga case. This dealt the final death blow to the long and\r\nshort clause.[581] The complaint in this case arose from the fact\r\nthat freight rates to Chattanooga, Tennessee, from eastern cities were\r\nhigher than to Nashville, although the latter was the more distant\r\npoint. The Commission found that there was no water competition at\r\nNashville compelling the lower rate; but that there was competition of\r\nrailways and of markets. The Supreme Court reversed the Commission in\r\nits final attempt thus to revivify the moribund Fourth section, and\r\nfully confirmed its original view as to the meaning of the Alabama\r\nMidland decision. If such circumstances and conditions as competition\r\nof markets or railways at the two points were dissimilar, carriers\r\nmight without restraint depart from the long and short haul rule. Thus\r\nthe Fourth section of the law was to all intents and purposes repealed.\r\nComplaint after complaint was perforce set aside by the Commission.\r\nFor practical purposes this part of the law was rendered absolutely\r\nnugatory. The chapter was closed. For twenty years, in face of the\r\nlitigation above outlined, no order of the Commission respecting local\r\ndiscrimination was enforced. Only with its amendment in 1910, as\r\nsubsequently described,[582] did the long and short haul clause once\r\nmore resume its due importance upon the statute books.\r\n\r\nOne special case may be cited in this general connection, as typical\r\nof the arbitrary action of carriers particularly in the South. It\r\nwas this sort of thing which went far to arouse public opinion and\r\nfocus attention upon the need for real regulation.[583] The situation\r\nappears upon the accompanying map. The planters in a certain southern\r\nterritory served by the Louisville & Nashville railway had been\r\naccustomed to ship out their cotton to the North by various routes.\r\nIt might go by way of New Orleans, _via_ Pensacola, up the main line\r\nalong the Mississippi valley, or be hauled eastward to Savannah\r\nand other Atlantic ports, and thence go by vessel to New England.\r\nInasmuch as the through rate was the same by all routes, no monetary\r\nissue to the planter was involved. But not so to the railway. For by\r\nthe first routes it secured a long haul; while by the last it not\r\nonly was limited to short carriage of the goods, but was compelled to\r\naccept an even smaller fraction of the joint through rate. In this\r\ncase the Louisville & Nashville railway--which, by the way, more\r\npersistently denied the existence of abuses than any other road in the\r\ncountry--advanced the Savannah cotton rate arbitrarily in 1899 from\r\n$2.75 to $3.30 a bale. This effectually dammed up the eastern outlet\r\nand jeopardized the interests of the port of Savannah to that degree.\r\nDoubtless the Louisville & Nashville was not oblivious to the welfare\r\nof that great seaport. It could not afford to be, for Savannah's growth\r\nmust indirectly accrue to its benefit. It did not love Savannah less;\r\nbut it loved its own particular seaport, Pensacola, or the long haul\r\n_via_ Louisville, more. Maybe it was better that traffic should go out\r\nthis way--who knew best? The real point to be made is that no competent\r\ntribunal or process for impartially determining the question was\r\nprovided by the now emasculated law.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe work of the Commission during these discouraging years was\r\nnaturally affected most profoundly by these limitations placed upon\r\nits activity by the Federal courts. The number of formal complaints,\r\nnever large, steadily dwindled year by year. Thirty-nine were filed in\r\n1892; but in 1900 and the following year only nineteen were presented\r\nannually.[584] The Commission persisted in its statistical work with\r\nmarked success. Important independent investigations continued to be\r\nmade, in pursuance of the only policy remaining open to it, that of\r\npublicity. But even the informal complaints, representing mainly the\r\ngrievances of individual shippers rather than of competing cities\r\nor commercial bodies, were few in number, as the following official\r\nfigures show.\r\n\r\n  =====================================================================\r\n                                          | 1898 | 1899 | 1900 | Total\r\n  ----------------------------------------+------+------+------+-------\r\n  Informal complaints:                    |      |      |      |\r\n    Settled by payment of amount claimed  |   18 |    5 |    9 |   32\r\n    Settled by change of rates            |   10 |    7 |   12 |   29\r\n    Settled in other ways                 |   32 |   30 |   22 |   84\r\n    Pending                               |   16 |   20 |   31 |   67\r\n    Suggesting formal complaints          |   29 |   14 |   20 |   63\r\n                                          +------+------+------+-------\r\n                                          |  105 |   76 |   94 |  275\r\n  =====================================================================\r\n\r\nBut better times were coming. The return of commercial prosperity\r\nbrought with it new problems. Old abuses, quiescent during the long\r\nindustrial depression of 1893-1897, once more made their appearance.\r\nNew constructive legislation followed, based as before upon the\r\neconomic needs of the time, as they made themselves manifest; but\r\na great campaign of education, led by the vigorous personality of\r\nTheodore Roosevelt, was necessary, as we shall see, to compel Congress\r\nto act.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[547] _Cf._ Simon Sterne, Railways in the United States, 1912.\r\n\r\n[548] _Cf._ Appendix C, Int.

Most of the old long-standing grievances were still\r\non the docket. New sources of dissatisfaction and danger were now\r\nadded in plenty as a result of important industrial changes. The most\r\nfar-reaching of these was the spread of consolidation among railroads.\r\nThis, as we shall see,[585] led within a few years to a partition of\r\nthe entire railway net of the country into a few large systems, each\r\ncontrolled financially, although seldom by actual majority investment,\r\nby powerful individuals or banking groups, mainly located in New York.\r\nMany small local roads, long closely identified with the welfare\r\nof particular communities, were now merged in great systems under\r\nentirely different and probably absentee ownership and management.\r\nBoston, Baltimore, New Orleans, St. Paul, Cincinnati, not to mention\r\na host of other smaller places, seemed commercially cast adrift. The\r\nwelfare of railroads and of the particular communities in which they\r\nlay,--long supposed to be indissolubly linked together,--was now seen\r\nby concrete experience to be separable, often into conflicting parts.\r\nThe New Haven monopoly in New England might be managed rather in the\r\ninterest of New York than of the port of Boston. The Illinois Central,\r\nonce devoted whole-heartedly to the upbuilding of New Orleans, must\r\nnow, as a part of the Union Pacific system, comprehend San Francisco\r\nand even Savannah within the scope of its plans. New systems implied\r\nnew traffic arrangements. Railroad policy must of necessity involve a\r\nchoice, not between two evils, perhaps, but between a resultant good\r\nand a necessarily attendant evil. All these corporate changes made\r\ninevitably for much commercial readjustment. And each readjustment left\r\na trail of real or alleged grievances; for the settlement of which no\r\ncompetent tribunal existed. There can be no doubt, therefore, that the\r\nsignificant changes in the railroad map after 1899 had much to do with\r\nthe demand for new legislation.\r\n\r\nThe second new and general cause of dissatisfaction among the public\r\nwas the great and almost continuous rise of freight rates which\r\nbegan about 1900. This was of course a direct outcome of the spread\r\nof railroad consolidation. The movement of freight rates has been\r\nelsewhere described in detail.[586] It has appeared that the steady\r\ndecline which ensued for almost a generation after the panic of\r\n1873, was sharply reversed when combination succeeded competition as\r\na fundamental policy of railroading. This striking reversal of the\r\ncourse of railway charges was not, of course, an isolated phenomenon.\r\nIt took place in a period of marked and general rise of prices, not\r\nunconnected with changes in the value of gold. The upward trend was at\r\nfirst more striking, and apparently more irresistible, in the charges\r\nfor transportation than in the prices of commodities. Prior to 1899,\r\nnot even the most astute railroad managers ever anticipated any such\r\nchange. The Boston & Maine Railroad even permitted the inclusion of\r\na prohibition of any higher rates in future than were then in force,\r\nto be incorporated in the acts of the New Hampshire legislature\r\nauthorizing its leases of important lines. Attorneys sought to prove\r\nthat railroads were not subject to the law of increasing returns,\r\nbecause it was _inevitable_ as an economic law that with growth in the\r\nvolume of business, rates should progressively decline.[587] If there\r\nwas often public dissatisfaction at the scale of charges under these\r\nconditions, how irresistible might the unrest among shippers become\r\nwhen rates actually began to move so strongly upwards!\r\n\r\nA single illustration of the class of complaints thus engendered\r\nmay not be out of place.[588] It concerned the reasonableness of an\r\nincrease of two cents per hundred pounds on lumber from Georgia points\r\nto the Ohio river. From 1894 to 1903 these rates had been already\r\nraised by three or four cents, to a level of thirteen or fourteen\r\ncents; so that prosperity had been already discounted by a rise of\r\nthirty or forty per cent. On top of this, and despite an enormous\r\nincrease in the tonnage, came a further raise of two cents per hundred\r\npounds in April, 1903. This was too much. To this exaction, involving\r\nnot less than $132,000 per year additional freight rates, the lumbermen\r\nof Georgia objected. The Interstate Commerce Commission upheld their\r\ncontention; and in July, 1905, more than two years afterward, the\r\nCircuit Court sustained the Commission. Appeal was then taken to the\r\nSupreme Court which rendered a decision in 1907, more than four years\r\nafter the increase had occurred; and during which time the railroads\r\nhad been collecting the added charge. The shippers had naturally at\r\nonce shifted the burden upon the public so far as the competition of\r\nother lumber-producing centres, each championed by its own railroad\r\nor set of roads, would permit. No recovery of this tax, now held to\r\nbe unjust by the highest court in the land, could possibly be had.\r\nThe loss was irreparable. The frequency of complaints of this sort,\r\ninvolving the absolute reasonableness of rates, proves conclusively\r\nhow potent a factor in furthering legislation the rise of the scale of\r\ncharges had become.\r\n\r\nThe demonstration of the menace to public welfare of an inordinate\r\nconcentration of financial power in the hands of a few privileged\r\nindividuals, served a useful end in bringing about new legislation. The\r\ngeneral rise of rates had been a direct outcome of the substitution of\r\ncombination for competition among railroads. The danger of absolute\r\ndominion over all trade, commerce and finance without accountability\r\nto the law, was a concomitant of the growth of great railroad\r\nsystems.[589] A special investigation in 1905 showed, for example, that\r\nthe majorities of the boards of directors of practically all of the\r\nroads east of the Mississippi river might be selected from a group of\r\nonly thirty-nine persons. The spectacular career of Edward H. Harriman\r\nwith the Union Pacific and other companies was a convincing argument\r\nin itself. The disclosures in the New York insurance investigation of\r\n1905 as to the intricate ramifications of financial power came, as will\r\nshortly appear, at a most opportune time for promoting congressional\r\nactivity. The need of it was, perhaps, never more clearly shown than in\r\nthe following frank admission by Mr. Harriman in December, 1906,--only\r\na few months after the law had been amended,--made in the course of\r\na general investigation of railroad consolidations by the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission.[590]\r\n\r\nQuestioned as to where his policy of acquisition was to end, the\r\nfollowing colloquy ensued:\r\n\r\n    \"A. I would go on with it. If I thought we could realize\r\n    something more than we have got from these investments I would\r\n    go on and buy some more things.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"Q. Supposing that you got the Santa Fe?\r\n\r\n    \"A. You would not let us get it.\r\n\r\n    \"Q. How could we help it?\r\n\r\n    \"A. How could you help it? I think you would bring out your\r\n    power to enforce the conditions of the Sherman anti-trust act\r\n    pretty quick. If you will let us, I will go and take the Santa\r\n    Fe to-morrow.\r\n\r\n    \"Q. You would take it to-morrow?\r\n\r\n    \"A. Why, certainly I would; I would not have any hesitation; it\r\n    is a pretty good property.\r\n\r\n    \"Q. Then it is only the restriction of the law that keeps you\r\n    from taking it?\r\n\r\n    \"A. I would go on as long as I live.\r\n\r\n    \"Q. Then after you had gotten through with the Santa Fe and had\r\n    taken it, you would also take the Northern Pacific and Great\r\n    Northern, if you could get them?\r\n\r\n    \"A. If you would let me.\r\n\r\n    \"Q. And your power, which you have, would gradually increase as\r\n    you took one road after another, so that you might spread not\r\n    only over the Pacific coast, but spread out over the Atlantic\r\n    coast?\r\n\r\n    \"A. Yes.\"\r\n\r\nWas there ever a clearer case of megalomania, menacing the welfare of a\r\ngreat people?\r\n\r\nBut it was not alone the dangers incident to monopoly in transportation\r\nwhich excited popular alarm. There was the ever increasing danger\r\nof abuse of monopolistic power by the newly created industrial\r\ncombinations. Most of these had sprung up overnight in the great\r\npromotion movement of 1899-1901. The general public had long been\r\naware of the gross favoritism in transportation, which had created\r\nthe Standard Oil Company. It knew something of the power of the beef\r\npackers' monopoly, built up by the use of private car lines. But with\r\nthe publication of Miss Tarbell's History of the Standard Oil Company\r\nin 1903-1904, followed by the reports of the United States Commissioner\r\nof Corporations in 1906, its attention was newly directed to the\r\nevil.[591] Even the carriers themselves were now roused to protest by\r\nthe pressure for secret favors by large shippers. The Elkins amendments\r\nto the law in 1903, as we shall see, enabled the government to convict\r\nmany offenders. But even this new law was not enough. The rebating\r\nstill went on, under new and ingenious forms. If the United States\r\nSteel Corporation, the \"Sugar Trust,\" the International Harvester\r\nCompany, the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company and a host of others were\r\nnot restrained, monopoly in transportation would soon be followed by\r\nmonopoly in manufacture. Each new disclosure verified the suspicions\r\nof the public as to the magnitude of these abuses. The necessity of a\r\nspecial corrective was first applied to rebating; but this action in\r\nturn only served to reënforce the popular conviction that more general\r\nlegislation was necessary. The Elkins amendments of 1903 surely paved\r\nthe way for the Hepburn law three years thereafter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe so-called Elkins amendments to the Act of 1887,--the first changes\r\nof importance in its substantive clauses,--were made in 1903, in\r\nresponse to a demand of the carriers. Educated to a sense of the grave\r\nlosses of revenue incident to rebating and general rate cutting,\r\nprominent railroad men united in urging Congress to act. The ease and\r\ndecorum with which this legislation was passed is, in itself, eloquent\r\ntestimony to the organized influence of the railroads over Congress,\r\nwhich made itself felt during the next few years in opposition to\r\nfurther changes in the law for the benefit of the public. The entire\r\ninadequacy of the original act to prevent rebating had been proven\r\ntime and again. The Interstate Commerce Commission had done its best.\r\nThe Department of Justice had attempted to apply the equity processes\r\nof injunction without much result. Other Federal laws had been\r\ninvoked in vain. When the carriers themselves asked for more stringent\r\nlegislation, it was accorded by Congress with commendable despatch. No\r\nopposition whatever appeared. Nor was there much debate. The machinery\r\nof legislation moved expeditiously and almost without noise to the\r\ndesired end.\r\n\r\nThese Elkins amendments dealt solely with the provisions of law\r\nconcerning observance of published tariffs. They in no wise affected\r\nthe determination of what those tariffs should be. That problem of\r\nreasonableness was the bone of contention in the great struggle in\r\nCongress, hardly as yet under way but soon to follow. The changes\r\nin 1903, therefore, had mainly to do with penalties and legal\r\nprocedure. They were, as elsewhere outlined, five in number. The\r\nrailroad corporation itself,--and not merely its officers and agents\r\nas heretofore,--was made liable to prosecution and penalty. This put\r\nan end to the anomalous immunity hitherto enjoyed by the principal\r\nand beneficiary of a guilty transaction. Secondly, the penalty of\r\nimprisonment for departure from the published tariff,--added to the law\r\nin 1889 in the hope of rendering it more effective,--was removed. It\r\nhad been hoped that the reluctance of witnesses to become parties to\r\nsuch condign punishment of associates might thus be somewhat overcome;\r\nespecially since the liability to fines now ran to the corporation\r\nrather than to the individual. The third change in the law was of\r\ngreat importance, as it had been construed by the courts. Preferential\r\ntreatment of shippers had been made to depend upon proof; first, that\r\nrates lower than as published in the tariff had actually been allowed;\r\nand, in the second place, that these full tariff rates, or, at least,\r\nhigher rates, had been paid by others on like shipments at the same\r\ntime. Such proof had turned out to be practically impossible in any\r\ngeneral rate war; inasmuch as, at such times, rates were cut more\r\nor less substantially for all shippers alike. In other words, there\r\nmight well be departure from the published rates, without preferential\r\ntreatment. And it was the object of the law to put a stop to both of\r\nthese abuses. The Elkins law, therefore, explicitly made the published\r\ntariff the standard of lawfulness. Any departure from it, proven by\r\nitself alone, was declared a misdemeanor. In the fourth place, the\r\nnew law made shippers or any other interested parties defendants;\r\nwhereas formerly only the giver of rebates, not the recipient, could\r\nbe prosecuted. This change rendering the guilty shipper liable, was\r\nan eminently proper one. And then, finally, the new law provided for\r\nthe issuance of injunctions,--viz., peremptory orders punishable by\r\ncontempt of court,--by any Federal judge whenever the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission had reasonable ground for belief that any common\r\ncarrier was deviating from the published tariff, \"or is committing\r\nany discrimination forbidden by law.\" A summary prohibition from this\r\njudicial source, it was hoped, would act as a powerful deterrent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe enactment of more general remedial legislation than the Elkins\r\namendments was a far more serious matter. That statute has not\r\ninaptly been described as \"not even a preliminary skirmish. It was\r\na truce of the principals to abolish piracy.\" The original law of\r\n1887 was avowedly experimental and imperfect. With this in view the\r\nstatute had specifically directed that there should be transmitted to\r\nCongress in its annual reports \"such recommendations as to additional\r\nlegislation ... as the Interstate Commerce Commission may deem\r\nnecessary.\" This duty was conscientiously performed year by year. One\r\nmay find, therefore, in these documents, especially after 1896, the\r\nmost convincing presentation of the need for amendment of the law. Yet\r\ndespite its importance, Congress was for some years so intent upon\r\nmore pressing public business, that no action was taken in the matter.\r\nCurrency legislation, the Spanish War and the Philippines, the Isthmian\r\nCanal, pure food and the trusts quite engrossed public attention. And,\r\noddly enough, when the campaign opened seriously in 1899, activity was\r\nfor a time confined mainly to the Senate. This was in sharp contrast\r\nwith the situation both before 1887 and after 1905, when the upper\r\nhouse was the obstructive member.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1894 the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce had\r\nreported favorably a bill; but nothing came of it. Five years later,\r\nboth Senators Cullom of Illinois,--sponsor for the original law,--and\r\nChandler of New Hampshire introduced bills. All these measures aimed to\r\nconfer rate-making power upon the commission and to expedite judicial\r\nprocedure upon appeal. In the meantime important organizations,\r\nespecially in the West, such as the National Board of Trade and the\r\nConventions of State Railroad Commissioners, had taken the matter up.\r\nMuch evidence was heard by the United States Industrial Commission\r\nwhich dealt with it in an elaborate report in 1901.[592] The chances\r\nseemed favorable for action. The Senate Committee on Interstate\r\nCommerce in that year added several progressively inclined members. The\r\ngeneral freight rate increases of 1900 had greatly stirred the people.\r\nBut at this juncture the powerful new financial influences, concerned\r\nwith the formation of the great transportation systems, came into play.\r\nEffective regulation might interfere with some of these plans. The\r\nmatter was becoming serious. Railroad opposition began to organize.\r\nIt became clear that a bitter contest would be needed to secure\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nRenewed pressure from the public came in 1902. Senator Chandler had\r\nbeen retired by direct railroad influence in New Hampshire. But Senator\r\nCullom again brought in a bill,[593] which was consolidated with\r\nanother by Senator Nelson of Minnesota. Public interest was plainly\r\nrising; yet these measures all died in committee. And the House of\r\nRepresentatives was too busy with other concerns. But in 1903, for the\r\nfirst time, the lower house devoted some attention to the so-called\r\nCooper-Quarles bill;[594] although no vote was taken. It did, however,\r\nwith little debate, as we have seen, grant what the railroads asked for\r\nthe suppression of rebating in the passage of the Elkins amendments.\r\nThe necessity of general legislation on the subject was not yet\r\nstrongly felt. The trusts, floundering in the panic of 1903, seemed\r\nmore threatening to public order than the railroads. Only in a few\r\ncommunities like Wisconsin under the able leadership of Governor La\r\nFollette, had public opinion become sufficiently aroused to achieve\r\ndefinite results.\r\n\r\nMatters were finally brought to a head by the determined attitude of\r\nPresident Roosevelt. In his annual message to Congress in 1904 he made\r\nrailroad regulation \"a paramount issue.\" The remedies proposed differed\r\nlittle from those of the bills above mentioned. The cardinal point\r\nwas that the Interstate Commerce Commission was to be given power to\r\nprescribe actual rates, to be effective until reversed by the courts.\r\nUnder this spur, the House of Representatives passed the so-called\r\nEsch-Townshend bill--an administration measure--by the impressive\r\nmajority of 326 to 17. It was now the Senate's turn to delay. It,\r\nhowever, authorized its Interstate Commerce Committee to sit during the\r\nspring and summer, and to report in December.[595] A mass of testimony\r\nwas taken, which despite the activity of a powerful body of paid\r\nrailroad attorneys, proved to be most convincing. But even more cogent\r\nproof of the need of control was the outrageous attempt of the carriers\r\nto influence popular opinion through so-called publicity bureaus.[596]\r\nAn extensive service, regardless of cost, was set up with headquarters\r\nat Washington and with branches in all the leading cities, headed\r\nby the President of the Southern Railway. Bogus conventions, packed\r\nfor the purpose,--such as the \"Alabama Commercial and Industrial\r\nAssociation,\"--passed resolutions unanimously, to be scattered\r\nbroadcast by free telegraphic despatches all over the country.\r\n\"Associations for the Maintenance of Property\" held conventions; the\r\nfact being duly advertised. Palpably garbled news items from Washington\r\nwere distributed without cost, especially during the hearings of the\r\nSenate Committee. Even more insidious and misleading methods were\r\nemployed. An elaborate card catalogue of small newspapers throughout\r\nthe United States was made; in which was noted all of the hobbies,\r\nprejudices, and even the personal weaknesses of the editors. One of the\r\ncards is reproduced on this page. Magazine sections or \"ready to print\"\r\ninsides were also made up, in which appropriate and subtle references\r\nto railroad issues were concealed in a mass of general reading matter.\r\nTwo or three weekly letters were sent gratis to minor newspapers\r\nwithout regular Washington correspondents, containing \"good railroad\r\ndoctrine,\" together with spicy local news items. Dakota farmers got\r\nsuggestions as to the danger of the proposed legislation affecting\r\ntheir rates. Kentucky planters were warned of the probable effect\r\nupon tobacco prices. As an indication of the formidable proportions\r\nof this campaign of education, the Chicago office, alone, employed\r\nsome forty highly paid experts. Regular reports were rendered by this\r\nnews service to the railroads' committee, as to the results achieved;\r\nsetting forth the number of columns of news matter distributed and the\r\nchanges effected in the proportion of \"pro\" and \"con\" items published.\r\nIt was indeed a most astounding demonstration of the lengths to which\r\norganized corporate power would go to defeat regulative legislation.\r\nThat it proved upon exposure to be a boomerang for the railroad cause,\r\nis to be inferred from the entire absence of all such political methods\r\nfrom the succeeding campaigns dealing with further amendment of the law.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    TOWN     NAME OF PAPER  CIRCULATION  DATE OF ISSUE      POLITICS\r\n  ........................................................................\r\n  :         |            |     600     |     Wkly       |    Dem         :\r\n  :---------+------------+-------------+----------------+----------------:\r\n  :  1167   | xxxxxxxx   | Infl. small |     Sat        | Anti-beef      :\r\n  :         |            |             |                | Anti-oil       :\r\n  : xxxxxx  | Owner & Nd | 2nd paper   | 6-             | Anti-harvester :\r\n  :         |            |             |                | Anti-corp      :\r\n  :10870    |            | Farmers     |                | Anti-Rep       :\r\n  :         |            |             |                |   Machine      :\r\n  :C M St P |            | Weak Eds    |                | Pro-R R        :\r\n  :         |            |             |                | Pro-Roosevelt  :\r\n  :         |            |  1 50       |                |                :\r\n  :---------+------------+-------------+----------------+----------------:\r\n  : S.

The\r\npublic was plainly becoming insistent; with the result that the\r\nso-called Hepburn bill was passed by 346 votes to 7. Whether the\r\nSenate, under the influence of one of the most powerful lobbies ever\r\nlet loose upon a legislative body, would have yielded even then, had it\r\nnot been for an extraordinary conjuncture of economic events, one dare\r\nnot surmise. The general causes of dissatisfaction, already described,\r\nsuch as the spread of combination, the growth of autocratic power, the\r\nsteady rise of freight rates and the abuses of personal favoritism\r\nhad been long at work. But now at the psychological moment came the\r\ngeneral breakdown and congestion of railroad service all over the\r\ncountry;[598] the insurance investigation in New York; the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad coal car scandal;[599] the Atchison rebate disclosures,\r\nwith \"barefaced disregard of the law,\" besmirching a member of the\r\nPresident's cabinet;[600] and the exposure of the outrageous publicity\r\ncampaign methods of the carriers. The evidence was cumulative and\r\noverwhelming as to the need of action. The Senate was forced to\r\nacquiesce in a conference committee bill, passing it at the end with\r\nonly three dissenting votes.[601] On June 29, 1906, the Hepburn bill\r\nbecame law. The fundamental principle of governmental control over the\r\nmost powerful corporations in the country had been fully affirmed.\r\nIt was an historic event,--the most important, perhaps, in Theodore\r\nRoosevelt's public career,--and a not insignificant one in our national\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Hepburn law of 1906, in the first place, greatly broadened the\r\nfield of Federal regulation.[602] This was now extended to cover both\r\nexpress and sleeping-car companies. Pipe lines,--such powerful factors\r\nin the creation of monopoly in the oil business as opportunely showed\r\nby the Report of the Commissioner of Corporations in 1906,--were\r\nexpressly included. \"Transportation\" was now broadly defined as\r\ncomprehending among other things, \"all services in connection\r\nwith the receipt, delivery, elevation, and transfer in transit,\r\nventilation, refrigeration or icing, storage, and handling of property\r\ntransported.\" Whether certain of these powers, especially over pipe\r\nlines, are practically enforcible as well as legally sound, remains\r\nyet to be seen. The inclusion of all switches, spurs, and terminal\r\nfacilities, with appurtenances of all sorts, was an added detail of\r\nimportance, in view of the complicated uses made of them in connection\r\nwith rebating, as elsewhere described. And the express power to require\r\nfacilities for shipment, as well as to regulate joint rates and\r\nservices in every detail, was yet another notable extension of Federal\r\nauthority. Part-rail and part-water transportation was included; but\r\ncoastwise and inland traffic exclusively by water, was left out. In\r\nview of its intimate relation to rates and services by rail, this\r\nomission was unfortunate. The notorious instability of water rates and\r\nthe difficulties incident to the enforcement of the long and short haul\r\nclause, render such water-borne traffic of great importance in the\r\nproper regulation of carriers on land.\r\n\r\nThe significance of the Hepburn law, however, was not primarily in\r\nthe wider scope of Federal control. The heart of it consisted of its\r\nmore intensive character. The rate-making power of the Commission was\r\ngreatly increased. Two other points were contested with equal vigor,\r\nviz., the scope of judicial review of decisions of the Commission,\r\nand the question as to whether its orders in cases appealed should\r\ntake effect at once, or only upon final judgment by the Federal court.\r\nViewed in a large way, however, all three of these propositions\r\ndepended upon the determination of a basic issue. A clear separation\r\nof powers between the legislative, executive and judicial branches of\r\ngovernment was a fundamental principle in our Federal Constitution. It\r\nwas generally agreed that a considerable confusion of functions, laid\r\nupon the Commission by the original law, must in future be avoided.\r\nHere, it was said, was a body which, if empowered to make rates, would\r\nbe exercising a legislative function; if applying and enforcing them,\r\nwould be acting administratively; and if hearing complaints, would be\r\nserving as a court. It was generally conceded, nevertheless, except\r\nby a few extremists, that the time had now come when some competent\r\ntribunal must be provided for the effective and prompt settlement of\r\ntransportation disputes. To which one of these three branches of the\r\ngovernment should this important duty be assigned? In other words,\r\ndisregarding mere matters of detail, should the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission or the Federal courts be charged with the real control of\r\nthe common carriers of the country?\r\n\r\nThe alignment upon this question was clearly defined. The\r\nadministration and the representatives of the shippers and the general\r\npublic, were unanimously agreed that control of rates and regulations,\r\nto be effective must be through an administrative agency,--a body,\r\nthat is to say, attached to the executive branch of the government.\r\nTheir reasons will be set forth in due time. On the other hand every\r\nrailroad proposition was based upon the exercise of real control by\r\nthe judiciary. The Commission, as an administrative body, was not\r\nto be abolished; but in all matters of rate regulation it was to be\r\nsubordinated to the courts. The motives for this policy will also\r\nappear shortly. Senator Foraker of Ohio,--soon retired because of\r\nhis uncompromisingly pro-railroad attitude,--proposed to strip the\r\nCommission of all rate-making power whatsoever; and to reduce it to\r\nan initiating body which should merely certify all complaints to the\r\nFederal courts for settlement. Senator Elkins of West Virginia,--an\r\nequally ardent railroad representative,--introduced a bill to create\r\na special transportation court, subordinate only to the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States on questions of law. Until this tribunal\r\nhad heard the cause, and had sanctioned interference on the ground\r\nof unreasonableness, the Interstate Commerce Commission might not\r\nintervene.[603] And in any event its functions were to be mainly\r\nconnected with the enforcement, not the promulgation, of orders as to\r\nrates or service. These plans favoring the carriers' interests, as we\r\nshall see, were all based upon the proposition that Congress could\r\nnot constitutionally delegate general rate making, that is to say,\r\nlegislative power to an administrative body.\r\n\r\nThe constitutionality of clothing an administrative body with large\r\nregulative power by act of Congress, was, of course, essential to\r\nthe administration's plan. It was urged that there was one exception\r\nto the general rule that power delegated to Congress to legislate\r\nunder the Constitution could not be further delegated. \"There may be\r\nsuch delegation where the purpose in the original conferring of the\r\npower can be subserved only by its delegation to an agent. Obviously\r\nCongress cannot spend time and labor upon rate making, even were it\r\neconomically competent to do so. If the power is to be exercised at\r\nall, practically, it can be done only through an agency like the\r\nCommission.\" Congress certainly could not delegate such legislative\r\npower, viz., power to make rates, to the courts. That would even\r\nmore flagrantly transgress the constitutional rule. In brief, any\r\nplan for judicial control meant the exclusion of rate regulation in\r\nany thoroughgoing way. And that, of course, was the reason why the\r\n\"railroad Senators\" all insisted upon such a plan. Other support for\r\nthe administration plan was found in the _dictum_ of the court in the\r\nMaximum Rate case;[604] and in opinions cited by the Attorney-General\r\nin a special message on the subject to the Senate.[605] These and other\r\npoints, such as the bearing of the so-called \"preference clause\" of\r\nthe Federal Constitution requiring equality of treatment in commerce\r\nbetween all ports of the United States, need not detain us further.\r\nThe constitutionality of the amendments have now been duly upheld.\r\nBut, inasmuch as the particular form which the law assumed was the\r\noutcome of these debates, it is essential that they be reviewed. Other\r\nquestions of interpretation at a later time, also follow the same line\r\nof cleavage in debate.\r\n\r\nJudicial regulation of common carriers, as proposed by the railroad\r\nadvocates, was open to many objections; so controlling that they\r\nfortunately turned the scales in favor of the administration plan.\r\nThe first of these was in itself so fatal that it is almost a work of\r\nsupererogation to state the others. Judicial control, as we have seen,\r\nhad been the outcome under the old law. It was the desperate plight\r\nfrom which escape was sought. No decisions could be rendered until the\r\nrate or practice had been put into effect. The denial of power to make\r\nrates for the future had broken down the old law. The stable door might\r\nindeed be closed, but only some years after the horse had been stolen.\r\nTherein lay the primary defect of all judicial processes. When the\r\nbituminous coal-carrying roads and water lines were collecting fifty\r\ncents a ton additional on 10,000,000 tons of coal annually, destined\r\nfor New England alone, as a result of the practical elimination of\r\nmonopoly since 1904, the only effective way to prevent irreparable loss\r\nto consumers, would be to veto the increase before it went into effect.\r\nFor a Federal judge to hold it an unreasonable exaction, four years or\r\neven six months after it had been paid, would be of no benefit to the\r\ncoal-consuming public, upon which the incidence of the tax really fell.\r\n\r\nThe entire futility of judicial control was well exemplified in\r\nthe Colorado Fuel and Iron Company case of 1895. This corporation\r\ncomplained of excessive rates from Pueblo, Colorado, to San Francisco\r\non iron and steel. The Interstate Commerce Commission ordered the\r\nrates on steel rails not to exceed forty-five cents per one hundred\r\npounds, or seventy-five per cent. of the Chicago-San Francisco rate\r\non the same commodity, whatever that might be. The Southern Pacific,\r\nunder pressure, complied with this order for about two years; and\r\nthen in 1898 advanced the rate one-third, to sixty cents per one\r\nhundred pounds. Thereupon the Iron Company obtained an injunction\r\nfrom the United States Circuit Court prohibiting the violation of the\r\nCommission's order. The case went to the Circuit Court of Appeals,\r\nwhich reversed this decree. Meantime, proceedings before a master had\r\nfixed the amount of damages under the rate increase at $35,300. The\r\ncourt held that these damages, if due, could be recovered before a jury\r\nwhich should establish the unreasonableness of the rates in force. But\r\nwhile this was being done, what became of the California business of\r\nthe Colorado Fuel and Iron Company? The Pacific coast was one of its\r\nmost important markets. The price of steel rails for competitors from\r\nPittsburg or Europe, who ship by water, would remain quite undisturbed.\r\nIt would be difficult to recover trade when once lost. No damages,\r\nbased upon mere increased freight rates, actually paid, would begin\r\nto measure the possible loss. And, moreover, even if this sum were\r\nrecovered after prolonged litigation, the situation would not be\r\nremedied. Precisely the same rates which gave rise to the damages would\r\nstill be in effect. An indefinite series of litigations might result,\r\nwhich would harass the company and perhaps drive it from the field\r\naltogether. The outcome of this Southern Pacific case sufficiently\r\nproves, even where the shipper is a powerful corporation, the futility\r\nof seeking redress through judicial proceedings. Again and again one is\r\nforced back to the same conclusion: that the only remedy for an unjust\r\nrate is not to continue an unfair one and pay damages, but as speedily\r\nas possible to substitute a reasonable charge. How much greater force\r\nhas this conclusion for the small shipper, if the remedy fails even for\r\nan industrial combination, powerful enough to extort secret rebates\r\nof $1,000 a day from the Atchison railroad, as proved in the now\r\ncelebrated Morton case of 1906!\r\n\r\nOther serious objections to judicial control may be briefly stated.\r\nThe functions of a court, acting judicially, permit of reliance as to\r\nreasonableness upon only one standard, viz., that the rate or practice\r\nunder consideration will lead to confiscation of property. The courts\r\ncan set this maximum limit to charges; but above that point they are\r\npowerless to intervene. Rates for the future must be judged with the\r\nsame freedom exercised by the traffic officials who promulgated them in\r\nfirst instance. Correction can be applied only by an expert tribunal,\r\npossessed of the same sort of knowledge had by those who issued the\r\ntariff or ordered the practice at the outset. Of course, the objection\r\nof lack of technical knowledge on the part of judges, might be readily\r\nenough overcome by means of a specialized professional personnel.\r\nBut the objection that judicial control, in contradistinction to\r\nadministrative regulation, is necessarily intermittent rather than\r\nsteady and constant is one not so easily met. As has been recently well\r\nsaid of our Federal policy toward the trusts, \"Government by a series\r\nof explosions is rarely effective.\" There are too many and too long\r\nintervals between decisions. And then again, there is the slowness of\r\nformal court proceedings and the necessarily conservative attitude of\r\njudges, in matters concerning vested property rights. These arguments\r\nwere all unanswerable in the end. It was inevitable that control\r\nshould be exercised by a distinct enlargement of the powers of the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission, as an adjunct of the executive arm of\r\nthe government.\r\n\r\nThe law of 1906[606] authorized the Commission upon complaint\r\nto \"determine and prescribe\" just and reasonable maximum rates,\r\nregulations or practices to be thereafter observed; and to order\r\nconformity thereto. Such orders, except for money payments, were to\r\nbecome effective after thirty days; and were to remain in force for two\r\nyears, unless suspended, modified, or set aside by a court of competent\r\njurisdiction. In addition the Commission might order an apportionment\r\nof joint rates, when the carriers are unable to agree upon a division;\r\nestablish through routes; and fix reasonable charges for services or\r\ninstrumentalities rendered or provided by shippers. This covers the\r\ncase of charges for icing refrigerator cars or for the use of special\r\nequipment.\r\n\r\nFairly general rate-making power was thus conferred upon the\r\nCommission; limited, however, to the adjudication of specific\r\ncomplaints. But the carriers being routed at this point, promptly fell\r\nback upon a second line of defences. Their representatives took a stand\r\nupon the directly consequent point of broad review by the Federal\r\ncourts of the Commission's orders. It was yet possible to practically\r\nnullify administrative control by according indefinite limits to the\r\nappellate jurisdiction of these courts. Might they pass upon law\r\npoints alone; or were they to be empowered to review the entire order\r\nof the Commission? A most brilliant constitutional debate again took\r\nplace in the Senate.[607] The first detail concerned the power of\r\nCongress to restrict the right of the lower Federal Courts to suspend\r\nthe Commission's orders by writ of injunction. Any limitation upon\r\nthis power would, of course, lessen interference with the Commission's\r\nmandates, and greatly promote a speedy settlement of transportation\r\ndisputes. Were these injunctions to be freely issued, holding up the\r\nCommission's orders and thereby leaving the old rate or practice in\r\neffect pending final adjudication, the carriers would, of course, then\r\nhave everything to gain and nothing to lose by their issuance. Every\r\norder might be attacked, not with any serious expectation of final\r\nsuccess, but merely to secure the benefit of the delay. And if, after\r\nthis delay, the widest possible scope of review were allowed in the\r\nformal trial of the case, judicial instead of administrative regulation\r\nmight still be brought about.\r\n\r\nThe first essential in the conservative programme, then, was to ensure\r\nthe most comprehensive right of review for all cases appealed. But\r\ncould Congress by statute limit or define the exercise of this judicial\r\npower on the equity side? There was no doubt as to its right under\r\nthe Constitution to create or abolish Federal courts, other than the\r\nSupreme Court. But could it restrict their judicial functions, legal\r\nor equitable, including primarily the power to issue injunctions?\r\nPractically, the alternative lay either in omitting all reference\r\nto the subject in the amended act, leaving the scope of the courts'\r\npowers to be determined by judicial construction of the statute; or\r\nin attempting to define it specifically, item by item. The carriers'\r\nrepresentatives would not agree to the former course, lest silence\r\nupon this matter, as they averred, might imperil the constitutionality\r\nof the law. Nor could the progressive reformers refuse a definition\r\nof the matter, under suspicion of bad faith. For if, as they had so\r\nstoutly maintained, the constitution amply safeguarded the rights of\r\nappellants without further prescription, a mere re-affirmation of these\r\nrights could do no harm. The result was a clause so worded as virtually\r\nto satisfy the conservatives; while ostensibly being a compromise.\r\nPower is expressly conferred upon the Circuit Courts,[608] by suit to\r\n\"enjoin, set aside, annul or suspend\" orders or requirements of the\r\nCommission. But this power is limited by the condition that five days'\r\nnotice must be given to enable the Commission to prepare its case\r\nfor protest. And the hearing must be had before three Federal judges\r\ninstead of one. These details were intended to prevent the issuance of\r\nrestraining orders for frivolous or merely obstructive reasons.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate feature of this compromise, arrived at only after\r\nweeks of bitter controversy, was its entire indefiniteness as to\r\nthe grounds upon which the courts might base their review of the\r\nCommission's orders. It thus stopped short of conferring more\r\nliberal powers of review for railroads than those enjoyed under the\r\nconstitution by all other classes of persons and property.[609] In\r\nso far the railroads lost their case. It is evident that Congress\r\nintended to create a really competent administrative board, with whose\r\norders the courts might interfere only when those orders were _ultra\r\nvires_, or unconstitutional. The courts under the law must accord\r\nthe same consideration to such decisions, \"if regularly made and\r\nduly served,\" as to an act of Congress, with the presumption always\r\nin favor of validity. Judicial interference might be expected only\r\nwhen the railroads had a good case. This, at least, was a clear gain.\r\nThere was yet another even more important one. Under the old law the\r\nburden of initiative or proof on all cases appealed, rested upon the\r\nCommission. This might now be reversed. Penalties formerly did not\r\nbegin to run until the final decision of the highest court to which\r\nappeal was taken, had affirmed the validity of the Commission's order.\r\nCarriers might continue to disobey with impunity throughout the period\r\nof protracted litigation. But now a penalty of $5,000 a day for each\r\nday's violation of the order, began at the expiration of thirty days.\r\nThe initiative to secure relief from this order must now come from\r\nthe carrier. It, and not the Commission, became the petitioner before\r\nthe courts. A speedier adjudication of contested cases might far more\r\nconfidently be expected under such conditions. But the grounds, legal\r\nor economic, upon which such determination of the reasonableness of the\r\nCommission's orders must rest, were, unfortunately, as we have seen,\r\nleft open for judicial interpretation in the course of time.\r\n\r\nThe railroads won a decided victory in one other bitterly contested\r\ndetail of the relation of the Commission to the courts. The new law\r\nstill left the old rate or practice of which complaint had been\r\nmade, in effect without penalty pending the review of the case. The\r\nadministration bill would not have permitted restraining orders to\r\nissue until the Commission's decision had been held unreasonable in\r\nformal review. The point appears to have been decided by Congress upon\r\neconomically unjustifiable grounds. The interval of time between the\r\nCommission's decision and the final settlement of the case might be\r\nconsiderable. Under the old conditions, the carriers had imposed the\r\nburden of disputed rates upon the public. The importance of this point\r\nmay be illustrated by the fact that during the protracted litigation\r\nin the Chicago Terminal Charge case, finally settled in 1909, the sum\r\ninvolved for this period alone amounted to $3,000,000. Was this fair?\r\nThe real disputants after all were not the government and the railway\r\ncompany. The Commission was supposedly acting impartially as an umpire.\r\nSuch being the case, unless it were shown that greater injustice would\r\nresult from the change, the natural condition would seem to be this;\r\nthat in cases of dispute the decision of the umpire, and not of the\r\nbigger contestant, should prevail until final settlement of the cause.\r\nThis would seem to be the obvious, the natural and the just conclusion\r\nfrom the premises.\r\n\r\nBut, the railroads contended, suppose the Commission should order a\r\nrate reduced, as in the Maximum Freight Rate case; put a lower tariff\r\ninto effect; and then the courts should ultimately decide that the\r\noriginal rate ought not to have been disturbed at all. The railroad\r\nmeantime would have suffered a corresponding loss of revenue on all\r\ntraffic carried at the low rate. This would certainly be a hardship,\r\nand incontrovertibly unjust. But would it be more so than that the\r\nshipper should unjustly have borne the burden in the contrary case?\r\nAs matters then stood, the public was compelled to pay the high rate,\r\neven if the courts afterward decided it to have been unreasonable. The\r\nrailway as an interested party enjoyed the benefit of the doubt, and\r\nimposed the burden of proof upon the public at all times. Would it not\r\nhave been more in consonance with justice, that the government, an\r\nimpartial umpire, should temporarily lay the burden upon that party\r\nagainst whose contention the greatest reasonable doubt existed?\r\n\r\nThe only just remedy would seem to be one which would insure final\r\nrecovery for unreasonable rates, by whichever party paid, during the\r\nuncertain period of adjudication. One of the principal objections\r\nof the railways to the proposed change arose at this point. Large\r\ncorporations are more responsible parties at law than most individual\r\nshippers. Suppose, through an unjustly low rate, a railway had\r\nsuffered loss of revenue; could it as readily recoup itself by suits\r\nfor damages against scores of shippers, large and small, as could the\r\nlatter, in the contrary case, recover back from the railway company?\r\nThis cogent argument suggested a compromise measure. Why not permit\r\nthe original railroad rate to continue in force, as before, pending\r\nfinal adjudication; but require the carriers to give bond for prompt\r\nrepayment of any surplus charges over those finally sanctioned by\r\nthe courts?[610] This would have left the business of rate making in\r\nrailway hands; and yet have afforded a substantial remedy for the\r\ndisputatious shipper.\r\n\r\nThe railways would not accede to such a compromise measure, with all\r\nthe financial burdens thereby entailed. Unfortunately even this scheme\r\nis woefully short of a just solution. The whole matter looms up larger\r\nat this point. Enter again the interests of the real consumer! In most\r\ncases freight rates to some degree affect the price of commodities. Has\r\nthe shipper, having paid a freight bill afterward adjudged unreasonably\r\nhigh, any right to sue for recovery of the amount? Has he not, with his\r\nfellow merchants, probably shifted the burden upon the public? Evidence\r\nshows that carload rates on cattle from Texas to South Dakota have been\r\nincreased within ten years after 1898, from sixty-five dollars to one\r\nhundred dollars. Probably part of this thirty-five dollars increase\r\nhas been taken from the profits of the cattlemen; but can there be\r\ndoubt that a part of it has been added to the price of beef?[611]\r\nNo, tackle it as you will, from whatever point of view, you return\r\nto the same proposition: that the damage of an unreasonable freight\r\nrate, once paid, is irreparable. Particular shippers may recover what\r\nseem to be damages; but which are likely not to have been so to them\r\nindividually at all.[612] By standards of abstract justice, the real\r\nsolution should distribute the temporary burdens incident to the delays\r\nof legal procedure, as nearly evenly as the laws of chance will permit.\r\nA compilation in 1905 showed that, of 316 freight rate cases decided by\r\nthe Interstate Commerce Commission, fifty-four per cent.--practically\r\none half--turned in favor of the complainant. Inasmuch as these\r\ncomplaints were practically all brought on behalf of shippers against\r\nthe railroads, this shows how evenly balanced the issues have been.\r\nWere the orders of the Commission to become effective at once, the\r\nlosses incident to errors afterward corrected by the courts, would be\r\ndistributed in about equal proportions. Under the law even as amended\r\nin 1906, all the penalty of a mistake falls upon the shipper and the\r\npublic; the railway always goes scot free. An impartial commission\r\nshould be clothed with power to distribute these onerous burdens by\r\nprescribing the temporary rate. Quite possibly the limitation of the\r\nequity power of Federal judges to protect the railroads in their\r\nconstitutional rights, might have been overthrown by the Supreme Court;\r\nbut the advantage in the contrary case would have been well worth the\r\nrisk.\r\n\r\nThe only remedy left for the public under the circumstances of\r\ncompromise above outlined, was to forward the course of judicial\r\nprocedure in every way. The Expedition Act of 1903 had done much.\r\nThe new amendments went still further, by providing for appeal\r\ndirectly to the Supreme Court with the privilege of precedence upon\r\nits docket. Other details served the same purpose. Formerly it had\r\ntaken much time for the Commission to prepare its formal orders and\r\nits _prima facie_ case for the courts. All the evidence had to be duly\r\nset forth.[613] Except for damage suits, all this was now changed.\r\nThe Commission in its orders need only state its conclusions in the\r\npremises, without the delays, labor and expense incident to formal\r\nre-examination of witnesses and the preparation of extended records of\r\nevidence. This has materially expedited the settlement of contested\r\ncases. It has yet another advantage. The Commission was stripped of\r\none of its semi-judicial functions; always an anomaly under our plan\r\nof government. And the assignment of the duty of formal prosecution of\r\ncases on appeal to the Attorney-General of the United States, was yet\r\nanother improvement along the same line.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of personal discrimination, the disheartening persistence\r\nof illegal practices, despite the provisions of the Elkins law of\r\n1903, rendered it necessary to specifically extend jurisdiction\r\nof the Commission over private car lines; and to confer authority\r\nover all incidental services at terminals. Separate publication\r\nof storage, icing and other charges was called for; and railroads\r\nwere held responsible for the provision of special equipment when\r\nrequested. Industrial railroads, \"tap lines,\" spurs and sidings, so\r\ningeniously employed in discrimination,[614] were expressly included\r\nunder the Commission's authority. Passes for individuals, a fruitful\r\nsource of favoritism and political corruption in the past, were even\r\nmore particularly prohibited. The only exceptions were for employees\r\nand their families, the poor or unfortunate, and persons engaged\r\nin religious or philanthropic work. In this connection, it may be\r\nadded that the law of 1910 somewhat modified this rule by enlarging\r\nthe meaning of \"employees\" to include caretakers of milk and other\r\ncommodities. It also dealt with the issuance of franks by express,\r\ntelegraph and telephone companies in some detail. Superannuated or\r\npensioned employees and the bodies of persons killed in service might\r\nalso be carried free. Such details are significant as illustrating the\r\nextreme nicety of definition required by the drastic character of the\r\nprohibitions.\r\n\r\nAn important change was also made by the law of 1906 in re-imposing the\r\npenalty of imprisonment, as well as of fine, for departure from the\r\npublished tariff. Its removal from the original law of 1887, in the\r\ninterest of effective enforcement, was recognized as a mistake. With\r\nthe complete affirmance by the courts of power to compel the production\r\nof evidence, recalcitrant witnesses were now under control. It was\r\nhoped that vigorous prosecution with this criminal punishment added,\r\nmight put an end to the abuse.\r\n\r\nAn entirely new feature was added to the law by the so-called\r\n\"Commodity Clause.\" This sought to divorce transportation entirely\r\nfrom all other lines of business. The experience of years had shown\r\nthat corporations, especially in the coal-fields, by combining both\r\nthe service of carrier and shipper, might most effectively stifle\r\ncompetition of independent producers. Rank discrimination might be\r\nconcealed by means of ingeniously framed systems of inter-company\r\naccounts. And denial of equal facilities such as cars or sidings might\r\noperate to drive competitors out of the business. While the Hepburn\r\nlaw was before Congress, several events drew attention forcibly to\r\nthe existence of such abuses. The Interstate Commerce Commission\r\nin April, acting under the Tillman-Gillespie resolution, uncovered\r\nflagrant violations of law on the Pennsylvania system.[615] Equally\r\nimportant was the decision handed down in February by the Supreme\r\nCourt in the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad case.[616] This dealt with\r\ndiscriminatory rates on soft coal for the New Haven road, given by\r\nmeans of manipulation of the pro-rating division between the various\r\ncompanies interested. The general public was also greatly concerned\r\nover the growth of monopoly in the anthracite fields and the coincident\r\nrise in the price of coal. The independent producers in the soft coal\r\nregions were at the same time roused over the grievous discriminations\r\npractised against them, especially in West Virginia.[617] Senator\r\nElkins of that state,--usually a strong railroad partisan,--introduced\r\nthe amendment under pressure from his constituents. It was warmly\r\nsupported by the most radical administration representatives. For it\r\nwas apparent at once that a withdrawal of railroads from all such\r\ncorrelated businesses was not only proper in itself, but would also\r\ngreatly promote the enforcement of many other provisions of the law.\r\nYet the radical character of the proposition was perhaps scarcely\r\nappreciated. Some railroads, like the Lackawanna, were dependent for\r\nnearly three-fourths of their tonnage upon the anthracite coal traffic;\r\nmuch of it from their own mines. The Chesapeake and Ohio in the eastern\r\nfields and the 'Frisco in the Middle West, relied upon soft coal for\r\nmore than half of their tonnage. A great many other carriers were\r\ninterested to a lesser degree. To compel them all to give up their coal\r\nproperties was indeed a serious matter.\r\n\r\nThe \"commodity clause\" provided that \"after May 1, 1908, it shall be\r\nunlawful for any railroad company to transport from any state ... to\r\nany other state ... any article or commodity other than timber and the\r\nmanufactured products thereof, manufactured, mined, or produced by\r\nit, or under its authority, or which it may own in whole or in part,\r\nor in which it may have any interest, direct or indirect, except such\r\narticles or commodities as may be necessary and intended for its use in\r\nthe conduct of its business as a common carrier.\"\r\n\r\nThe original proposition was even more drastic. It was to apply to all\r\ncommon carriers, such as the pipe lines in the oil business. But it\r\nwas soon considerably modified in the course of passage.[618] First,\r\nit was limited to railroads. Then the western senators, on behalf of\r\nthe lumber industry, secured its special exception. And, finally, an\r\nattempt to prohibit specifically the control of subsidiary industrial\r\ncompanies through stock ownership was defeated. But, as thus limited,\r\nthe clause finally passed the Senate,--the stronghold of the railroad\r\ninterests,--by a vote of 67 to 6. This affords a good indication of the\r\nextent of popular feeling on the subject. It was fortunate indeed that\r\nthe prohibition was not to take effect for two years, in view of the\r\nlitigation necessary for its precise interpretation. For in any event\r\nit was bound to lead to much corporate readjustment. The course of\r\nthese proceedings will be considered in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere remains for consideration one of the most important provisions of\r\nthe Hepburn law, namely that dealing with publicity of accounts.[619]\r\nSection twenty of the law of 1887 called for the filing by all carriers\r\nof annual reports with the Interstate Commerce Commission. These\r\nreports were to be standardized; and the Commission was empowered, in\r\naddition, to demand specific information whenever it was so desired.\r\nBut the absence of express authority to enforce these orders, except by\r\nmeans of tedious equity proceedings in the courts, made improvements in\r\naccounting almost entirely dependent upon the tact and resourcefulness\r\nof the statistician. The Commission was most fortunate in the services\r\nof Prof. Henry C. Adams, who succeeded in bringing about cordial\r\ncoöperation between the accounting officials of the railroads and the\r\ngovernment. Great improvements in the line of uniformity resulted; but\r\nthe need of positive control became increasingly apparent.\r\n\r\nMany officials were unwilling to certify by oath to the correctness\r\nof their returns. With the increasing size of the roads, it became\r\nmore and more difficult to secure promptness. The annual Statistics of\r\nRailways had almost to await the pleasure of the carriers in filing\r\ntheir statements. And vitally important information was often withheld.\r\nIn the case of the Lake Shore road, for example, which for years had\r\ncharged all its improvements to operating expenses, it positively\r\ndeclined to state what portion of those improvements were permanent\r\nadditions to the property, properly chargeable to capital account, and\r\nwhat were in the nature of renewals and repairs. And the Supreme Court\r\nhad found no authority in the law to compel the furnishing of this\r\ninformation.[620] With the growth of extended systems of railroads,\r\ncharacterized by the most involved methods of inter-corporate\r\naccounting, the need of precise data became ever more imperative.\r\nSomething more was evidently necessary than a mere expression by\r\nCongress of an opinion favorable to publicity. The mandatory provisions\r\nadded in 1906 to the Twentieth Section are, therefore, vital, not only\r\nin themselves; they are essential to the administrative enforcement\r\nof nearly every other part of the regulative law. A determined effort\r\nwas made in 1908 to defeat the purpose of this clause by restricting\r\nappropriations for carrying it into effect.[621] But it emerged\r\nunscathed--thanks to President Roosevelt--and stands today as one of\r\nthe best features of the new statute.\r\n\r\nOne may readily distinguish no less than five distinct and important\r\nspecial services to be rendered by full publicity of accounts. The\r\nearliest to be fully appreciated was its serviceableness in securing\r\nequality of treatment of all shippers. In the good old freebooters'\r\ndays, rebates were probably openly entered as such on the books. But\r\nwith the need of concealment, they came to be covered up in all sorts\r\nof ways; oftentimes under such guises, as in the notable Atchison\r\ncase, in such manner that not even the directors knew what they meant.\r\nWith full standardization of accounts, such abuses may readily be\r\ndetected and the offenders traced and punished. In the second place,\r\nopen standardization of the books makes strongly for more efficient\r\nand honest operation.[622] The comparative method in statistics may\r\nbe readily applied; so that the president of a railroad may have\r\nat command a complete statement of operations in detail, which is\r\ncomparable not only with his own results in preceding years but with\r\nother roads similarly circumstanced. The haphazard and unscientific\r\nmethods of operation in the British Isles are largely a resultant of\r\nthe absence of any logical and uniform system of public accounts.[623]\r\n\r\nDetailed cost keeping in the management of great systems of\r\ninter-related railroads, being absolutely essential to efficiency,\r\nmakes also for honesty in operation. Such gross frauds as developed\r\nupon the Illinois Central in 1910, variously estimated to have cost the\r\nroad from $2,500,000 to $5,000,000 through overcharges for equipment\r\nrepairs, might readily enough have been detected under an efficient\r\nand honest management. This instance immediately suggests a third\r\nadvantage of full publicity of accounts, namely the protection of\r\ninvestors. Flagrant manipulation of maintenance accounts, \"skinning\"\r\nor \"fattening\" roads in the interest of inside speculators, has\r\nalways been dependent upon secrecy. Assurance of a stable market for\r\nrailroad securities, based upon entire frankness as to the degree to\r\nwhich these properties are being kept whole or improved, is one of the\r\nprime advantages which may be expected to flow from such governmental\r\nprescription of accounts. And general public confidence in railway\r\ninvestments cannot conceivably be better encouraged than by such\r\npublicity. In no other detail than this, does the Act to Regulate\r\nCommerce more directly benefit the general body of stockholders in\r\nrailroads, as well as the corporations themselves.\r\n\r\nThe three foregoing advantages of publicity had been long appreciated.\r\nThese recent changes introduced in the Federal law brought two others\r\ninto special prominence. One is the newly assumed responsibility by the\r\ngovernment in the matter of rate making. The other is its intervention\r\nin cases of dispute between the carriers and their employees. In both\r\ncases it is imperative that there should be available data for a just\r\ndetermination of the issues at stake. There must be assurance that\r\nevery essential feature of the situation is fully and fairly set forth\r\nupon the books. Otherwise, as in disputed rate cases, every fact as\r\nto cost of service,--a primary basis of measurement,--is vitiated.\r\nAbsurd and misleading calculations may be presented in evidence, which\r\ngreatly hamper the government in deciding the case.[624] And now with\r\nthe projected physical valuation of properties as an element in rate\r\nmaking, all of the factors of maintenance, betterment and depreciation,\r\nof joint facilities, rentals and sinking funds must be taken into\r\naccount. In labor disputes, the same considerations apply.[625] Under\r\nthe requirements of the Erdman Act, every mediation,--and the need for\r\nit is more frequent every year,--calls for critical analysis by the\r\nchairman of the Commission and the Federal commissioner of labor of the\r\nstatements from both sides as to the reasonableness of the action to be\r\ntaken respecting wages or conditions of employment.[626] The notable\r\narbitration in 1912 is the most important instance as yet. Having\r\nall of these services in mind, it seems likely that the accounting\r\nprovisions added to the law in 1906 will be second to none in bringing\r\nabout the elimination of existing evils, and in standardizing and\r\nimproving operation, finance and traffic practice.\r\n\r\nUnder the new law monthly and special as well as annual reports,\r\nmight be required under oath; with appropriate penalties of fine and\r\nimprisonment for delay or mis-statement. All accounts must be kept\r\naccording to forms, general and detailed, prescribed by the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission. Such rules applied of course to all carriers\r\nsubject to the law, such as express and sleeping-car companies, pipe\r\nlines and even water carriers where operated in connection with\r\nrailroads. Moreover, the Commission was to have access to the books at\r\nall times. For this purpose, it might employ special examiners.[627]\r\nIn other words, the system employed for years in connection with the\r\nregulation of national banks, was now extended to the interstate\r\ncarriers. An additional safeguard was provided in the clause which made\r\nit unlawful to keep any other accounts books or memoranda than those\r\napproved; with the same penalties for violation. In brief, the policy\r\nwas now perfectly definite. Carriers were rendered public service\r\ncompanies in every sense of the word. Mere indefinite publicity was\r\nreplaced by specific regulation. This policy was not only clearly\r\nwritten in the law; but the Commission in promulgating its orders\r\nrelative to accounting, laid upon every officer concerned, full\r\npersonal responsibility for the statements rendered. Minor officials,\r\nmade scapegoats for chief offenders, were no longer to be tolerated.\r\nThe relation between agent and principal was clearly defined. It was\r\nassumed that so far as accounts were concerned, such officials were\r\nrepresentatives of the Commission in carrying out the law. A new\r\nprinciple was introduced in the regulation of carriers which could\r\nnot fail to be productive of great good. In this respect the Hepburn\r\namendments granted all that the most ardent advocates of publicity\r\ndemanded.[628]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA summary view of this important legislation,--in form merely an\r\namendment of the original law of 1887, but in reality constituting\r\nan entirely new departure,--may now be had. The gains for effective\r\nregulation were considerable. Among them may be noted its enlarged\r\nfield, the separation of transportation from other businesses,\r\nelimination of the iniquitous railroad passes, control over joint rates\r\nand pro-rating, the expedition of judicial procedure, full publicity\r\nof accounts, enhancement of the dignity and compensation of the\r\nCommission, and, most important of all, the grant in so many words of\r\nadministrative rate-making power. The carriers--and the administration\r\nalso--failed to obtain the much-desired repeal of the prohibition of\r\npooling. On the other hand, as against these gains for reform should\r\nbe set the following concessions to the railroads. Rate-making control\r\nwas still subject to broad court review. No one as yet knew what this\r\nmight bring forth. Maximum rates only might be prescribed. And much\r\nas to the proper relativity of rates, involved both in matters of\r\nfreight classification and of enforcement of the long and short haul\r\nclause, was left untouched. Rate advances were still possible without\r\ndetermination of their reasonableness in advance. Suspension of orders\r\npending judicial review, still remained. There was as yet no control\r\nover physical operation, such as furnishing cars, although switches\r\nmight be ordered. Many of the states had long since undertaken this\r\nwork. And the great body of independent carriers on our inland waters\r\nwere still left beyond the reach of the Federal law. In the main, the\r\nadministration had won a notable victory, although at some considerable\r\ncost. The principle of effective regulation of public-service carriers\r\nhad been, indeed, vigorously affirmed in no mistakable terms. But the\r\ntask was not yet completed. Many details of law were needed to \"Clinch\r\nthe Roosevelt policies.\" Nevertheless, it was probably better that a\r\nbrief experience with the new law, both among the people and in the\r\ncourts, should precede further legislation. Great reforms should not be\r\ntoo suddenly effected, else reaction is certain to take place. For the\r\ntime being a positive step forward had been taken.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[585] Exhaustively described in volume II.\r\n\r\n[586] Chapter XII, _supra_, and chap.

Within\r\ntwo years over nine thousand appeals were made to it in one form or\r\nanother for the adjustment of transportation disputes. The overwhelming\r\nmajority of these complaints were settled informally out of court; and\r\nin this work of conciliation one of the most conspicuous and beneficial\r\nfunctions of the new commission appears. But, nevertheless, an\r\nincreasing number of grievances seem to have required a formal hearing\r\nand decision of record. Some indication of the public relief sought\r\nis afforded by the fact that within approximately the first two years\r\nand a half,--up to August 28, 1908,--1053 cases on the formal docket\r\nwere disposed of, leaving over five hundred issues still undecided.\r\nAs compared with this total of over fifteen hundred formal complaints\r\nunder the new law, the number filed under the old statute amounted to\r\nonly 878 throughout the long period of eighteen years.[629] Moreover,\r\nthe number of complaints filed, steadily increased for several years.\r\nThe accompanying diagram well illustrates the great revival of interest\r\nwhich took place. The two curves show respectively the number of formal\r\ncomplaints by administrative years since 1892, and the total of both\r\nformal and informal ones since 1903. The sudden increase after the new\r\nlaw went into effect in 1906, is, of course, presaged by some accession\r\nof business during the preceding two years of public discussion. But\r\nthe results for the year 1907 first fully reflect the new conditions.\r\nFrom 65 formal complaints and 568 informal ones filed in 1905,\r\nthe numbers in each class rose within two years to 415 and 5,156,\r\nrespectively. It appears, however, that the climax was soon attained.\r\nSince 1908, the number of formal complaints considerably declined; and\r\nthe informal ones seemed to be about stationary in number. This was of\r\ncourse to be expected. The accumulated grievances of past years had\r\nbeen largely cared for. And the improved conditions brought about were\r\nless productive of new sources of trouble.\r\n\r\nDelay in settlement of claims for damages by shippers has long been\r\na great source of discontent. The Commission has grappled with this\r\nproblem vigorously. The following table shows what has already been\r\naccomplished. The figures are for administrative years, as covered by\r\nthe annual reports to Congress.\r\n\r\n  ======================================================================\r\n          | Number of claims filed | Number denied | Reparation awarded\r\n  --------+------------------------+---------------+--------------------\r\n    1907  |          561           |      --       |     $104,700\r\n    1908  |         3789           |     1486      |      154,703\r\n    1909  |         4406           |     1199      |      311,978\r\n    1910  |         5103           |     1463      |      404,976\r\n    1911  |         5653           |      739      |      329,388\r\n  ======================================================================\r\n\r\nHere, again, it appears as if the maximum load had been reached, so far\r\nas the Commission is concerned. Testimony of shippers is emphatic upon\r\nthis point.[630] One railroad traffic manager stated that the number\r\nof overcharge claims against his line,--one of the most important in\r\nthe country,--was twenty-five per cent. less in 1909 than two years\r\nearlier; and that loss and damage claims were reduced approximately\r\none-third. A very large shipper compared his former \"claims suspense\r\naccount,\" sometimes amounting to $100,000, with $7,500 for 1909. The\r\nnumber of such overcharge claims was 1,008 in 1905. For nine months\r\nof 1909 it was 205. And yet these damages paid are but a trifle, as\r\ncompared with the aggregate of claim settlements made by the roads\r\ndirectly. For the fiscal year to June 30, 1910, such settlements made\r\nto shippers directly by steam roads amounted to $21,941,232. How much\r\nof this sum was a legitimate allowance for loss or damage incurred in\r\ntransit, one cannot discover. But it appears likely that an appreciable\r\nfraction served as a cover for personal discrimination. Compulsory\r\nreference to the government of all such claims would speedily determine\r\nthe true facts. In the meantime it is a satisfaction to know that\r\na competent tribunal now exists, to which appeal with a minimum of\r\nexpense may be made by aggrieved shippers. Furthermore, it should also\r\nbe noted in this connection, that the situation as respects claims\r\nhas been benefited by a detail of the law of 1906, not heretofore\r\nmentioned. The so-called Carmack amendment provided that carriers must\r\nissue a through receipt or bill of lading, and thereby become liable\r\nfor the shipment throughout its entire journey; that is to say, whether\r\nupon the initial road or a later connection. The legal principles\r\naccepted in England since 1841 are thus adopted. There is no doubt that\r\ngreat improvement in the relation between the roads and the shipping\r\npublic may be anticipated as a result.\r\n\r\nThe great improvement in respect of standardization of rates, evidenced\r\nprimarily through reduction in the number of separate tariffs issued\r\nby the railroads, has been elsewhere described[631] in connection with\r\nclassification. From 193,900 separate schedules in 1906 to less than\r\nhalf that number five years later is a notable achievement,--so notable\r\nindeed that it merits repetition in this connection. The course of\r\ncomplaints, of claims and of new rates filed at Washington, affords\r\ncumulative evidence of the great improvement in conditions which the\r\nnew legislation has brought about.\r\n\r\nThis activity of the Interstate Commerce Commission, it is almost\r\nneedless to mention, affords no true measure of the benefits resulting\r\nfrom the law. Like every other sound piece of legislation, it was\r\nintended to be preventive, not punitive. The number of arrests by\r\nthe police affords no indication of the effectiveness of a criminal\r\nstatute. Not the violations of law, but the breaches forestalled, are\r\nof real significance. And similarly in this instance, one surely finds\r\nthe primary benefit of legislation, not in the complaints preferred,\r\nbut in the fact that, under the improved relationship between the\r\nprincipals concerned, many long-standing causes of irritation and\r\nmisunderstanding are being removed. The real gain, not to be measured\r\nby figures, is to be found in the improved spirit of the intercourse\r\nnow prevalent between railway officials and their customers. The\r\nshipper--especially if he be a small one--having business to transact,\r\nmay now be sure of courteous treatment and a prompt and probably just\r\noutcome. In the old days he was too often made to feel his utter\r\neconomic dependence. As a high traffic official recently put it: \"One\r\nreason we do not like this law is because we have to stop and think\r\ntwice what we are about. We must be ready to explain and show a warrant\r\nfor every act. An attack of indigestion cannot any longer serve as an\r\nexcuse for an arbitrary, off-hand ruling.\" This improved spirit has\r\npermeated the whole staff of railway officials who have seen a new\r\nlight on the public aspect of their calling.[632]\r\n\r\nThe nature of the complaints before the Interstate Commerce Commission,\r\nwith its amplified powers under the new law, affords the best\r\nindication of the most important feature of its work, namely the\r\nsettlement of disputes between the railroads and their clients.[633]\r\nAnd it will be apparent that a large number of these only indirectly\r\nraise the issue of the actual freight rate. Oftentimes they concern\r\nrather the manner of conducting business. An attentive perusal of\r\nthese decisions of the Commission offers interesting evidence of the\r\nrange of a carrier's activities. Every little station all over the\r\ncountry between Aaron and Zuwash, and every conceivable commodity, from\r\n\"mole-traps in crates\" to \"jewelers' sweepings,\" is comprehended. The\r\nfact that these disputes, often pecuniarily insignificant, could not\r\nbe amicably adjusted by the good offices of the Commission informally,\r\nbut necessitated formal hearing and decision, is the strongest possible\r\nproof that some competent tribunal of this sort was greatly needed in\r\nthe interest of industrial peace.\r\n\r\nOne of the commonest petty complaints is of misrouting of freight.\r\nGoods are carried by a roundabout way, or by one not enjoying the\r\nlowest through rate. Thus, to be specific, in 1908 six carloads of\r\nprint-paper were shipped from Little Falls, Minnesota, to Boise,\r\nIdaho.[634] Three routes were open, the rates being respectively $1.30,\r\n$1.36, and $2.17 per hundred pounds. The Northern Pacific road, in\r\nabsence of instructions, sent the goods by the third route,--presumably\r\nthe one most profitable to itself,--the result being a freight rate\r\n$1,760.62 greater than it otherwise might have been. Reparation to this\r\namount was granted within three months by order of the Commission.\r\n\r\nAnother frequent difficulty concerns the supply of suitable cars for\r\nthe needs of the shipper. Carload rates are always proportionately\r\nlower than charges for package shipment.[635] The carriers very\r\nproperly prescribe a certain minimum lading as a requisite for the\r\ngrant of these proportionately lower wholesale rates. The shipper at\r\ncarload rates must, however, pay for the full capacity of the car,\r\nwhether his shipment fills it or not. No exception can be taken to\r\nthis practice, unless the carrier is unable or unwilling to supply\r\ncars of a suitable size. This sometimes happens. For instance, in 1908\r\na lumber-man in Oregon, having a shipment of 39,500 pounds to make to\r\na point in Pennsylvania, requested of the Southern Pacific a car of\r\n40,000 pounds capacity.[636] Not having one at hand, a much larger car\r\nwas furnished, having a minimum capacity of 60,000 pounds. Following\r\nthe standing rule as to carload rates, the shipper was compelled to\r\npay sixty-two and one-half cents per hundred pounds on the marked\r\ncapacity of the car, that is to say, on 20,000 pounds more freight than\r\nhe actually shipped. This made a difference of $128.12 in the freight\r\nbill--nearly fifty per cent. in excess of the charge based upon the\r\nactual shipment. The Commission issued its order for reparation within\r\nfive weeks of the filing of the complaint.\r\n\r\nA flagrant case of the misapplication of similar rules was recently\r\ndecided.[637] A retail druggist at Douglas, North Dakota, bought a\r\nsheet of plate glass eight feet square at St. Paul for forty-six\r\ndollars. Usually such large sheets have to lie flat on the car floor;\r\nand, occupying so much space, are properly assessed at a minimum weight\r\nof five thousand pounds, regardless of the actual lading. But in this\r\ninstance the glass was carried upright, screwed to the end of the car,\r\nalong with a lot of miscellaneous freight. Applying the standard rule\r\nmade the freight bill for a distance of 587 miles, $9.50 more than\r\nthe _entire cost_ of the glass at St. Paul. It appears strange that\r\nthe carrier should have permitted so clear a case to come to a formal\r\nhearing at all. Presumably it contested it as much for the protection\r\nof its standard rules as for the sake of the actual revenue involved.\r\nNo exception can be taken to these shipping rules as a whole; but these\r\ncases make it evident that their application may be at times too\r\nharsh and rigid. The tribunal established by the new law performs a\r\nmuch-needed service to the community in tempering their application in\r\nexceptional instances.\r\n\r\nAttempts at arbitrary exclusion from participation in through\r\nshipments, in order to stifle competition, not infrequently crop out\r\nin these decisions. In 1905 the Enterprise line, capitalized at four\r\nhundred thousand dollars, put three steamers into commission from\r\nFall River to New York.[638] This independent line was of the utmost\r\nimportance to the cotton manufacturers, as it was expected that at\r\nNew York connection could be made with competing rail and water lines\r\nto every part of the United States. But all these lines, presumably\r\nat the behest of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, which\r\nhad hitherto enjoyed a monopoly of the business and which, with its\r\nenormous tonnage of high-grade freight to be parcelled out among\r\nconnecting lines at New York, was a formidable factor, promptly\r\ndeclined to join in making any through rates. All their local rates\r\nfrom New York on, were, of course, prohibitory. In one instance, while\r\nthe through rate accorded to the shipper over the New Haven road was\r\nsixteen and five-eighths cents per hundredweight from New York on, the\r\npatron of the Enterprise line was charged twenty-five and one-half\r\ncents for the same service.\r\n\r\nThis case recalls a similar one in 1897, when the independent Miami\r\nline of steamers from New York tried to break the monopoly held by the\r\nsteamship lines owned by the railroads out of Galveston, Texas. The\r\nroads not only refused to pro-rate, but actually demanded prepayment of\r\nfreights from Galveston on, as local rates. The Federal courts tinkered\r\nwith the subject for a while, until the Circuit Court of Appeals, while\r\nrecognizing a probable violation of law, affirmed that suit could\r\nbe legally instituted only by the United States.[639] Meantime, of\r\ncourse, the company was forced out of that business; and rates have\r\nsteadily risen ever since. In this later instance of the Enterprise\r\nline, the Commission promptly ordered an extension of the same\r\nprivileges to the independent line that were enjoyed by its powerful\r\nrival.[640]\r\n\r\nThe frequency of complaints as to the supply of equipment needed for\r\nthe regular operation of mills or mines, has already been noted. There\r\nmay be enough cars; but they may be supplied too irregularly.[641]\r\nAnd petitions for the issuance of through rates or the opening of new\r\nroutes became so common that a substantial amplification of the law\r\nin 1910, as we shall see, was effected in this regard. The carriers,\r\nof course, always prefer in case of a choice of routes, to take the\r\nlongest possible haul over their own lines. This operates to close the\r\nmore direct way. The northern transcontinental lines got more revenue\r\nfrom traffic which went east over their lines a thousand miles by way\r\nof Spokane, than when it was turned over to a rival line at Portland,\r\nOregon, after a haul by them of only one hundred and fifty miles.[642]\r\nEven in 1907, at the time of extreme congestion of the Northern\r\nPacific main line, when it was literally overwhelmed with business,\r\nthe lumbermen complained that they could find no relief by these other\r\nroutes.[643] Much the same question was raised in another way in 1909,\r\nby a complaint from growers and shippers of grain against the rate\r\nadjustment which forced or attracted Kansas grain to the Kansas City\r\nmarket, instead of permitting it to move on lower rates directly from\r\nthe point of origin to the Gulf ports for export, and to Texas milling\r\nand consuming points.[644] In this instance, however, the shippers\r\nfailed to make out a good case; so that the complaint was dismissed.\r\n\r\nNo grievance is too petty to receive consideration. A peachcanner in\r\nMartinsdale, Georgia, is awarded reparation of $8.91 on a shipment\r\nof three cars of his wares.[645] The sum of $11.84 is awarded to a\r\ncomplainant for an overcharge on eleven rolls of old worn-out canvas,\r\nassessed for freight rates as cotton goods instead of junk, which it\r\nproperly was.[646] Or in another case, where a small boiler was shipped\r\nfrom Kalamazoo to Blue Mounds, Michigan, on a combination of local\r\nrates, when it was properly entitled to a joint through rate, an award\r\nof $6.87 to the shipper followed.[647] It makes no difference whether\r\nthe welfare of a great territory or the smallest dealer is concerned.\r\nIt is all one to the government. The Hope Cotton Seed Oil Company[648]\r\nin the South, shipped seventeen carloads of one season's product in\r\n1907 out over a certain road, on a low through rate. The railroad agent\r\nwas then informed that these shipments interfered with the policy of\r\nestablishing new industries of this sort on another line; and the\r\nthrough rate was cancelled. This jumped the charges from seventeen\r\nand one-half cents per hundredweight to sixty-seven cents,--almost\r\nthe entire worth of the cotton-seed. Since the new law went into\r\neffect, the Commission has prescribed a new rate of thirty cents; and\r\nindustrial peace is the result.\r\n\r\nThus has the work of this tribunal gone on, with its daily grist of\r\nopinions on almost every conceivable phase of the transportation\r\nbusiness. It might be to prescribe that, even though inflammable,\r\nsmall-lot shipments of petroleum must be accepted by a carrier at\r\nleast twice every week, instead of on only one day; that structural\r\niron might be stopped off _en route_ at Indianapolis,[649] as it is\r\nat Chicago and St. Louis, to be sheared, fitted and punched, without\r\nlosing the benefit of a low through rate, just as cotton is halted\r\nat the compressor, or grain is milled in transit; that a definite\r\nrate must be quoted on jewelers' sweepings,[650]--the dirt and waste\r\nladen with particles of gold destined to the smelter,--even though\r\nit expose the carrier to the risk of exorbitant claims for damage in\r\ncase of accident; that the railroad was properly entitled to charge\r\nstorage after six months on brewer's rice left on a wharf pending\r\npiecemeal shipment to purchasers;[651] or that two different rates were\r\ncontemporaneously charged on nitrate of soda, according to whether it\r\nwas to be used in the manufacture of fertilizer or gunpowder.[652] But\r\nwhatever the issue, one has the satisfying conviction, after reading\r\nthe _pros_ and _cons_ in the decisions, not only that the matter\r\nhas been settled by a disinterested and supposedly impartial third\r\nparty, but that the decision is endowed with the beneficent force of\r\npublic authority. As one reads these decisions, there is no evidence\r\nof political log-rolling, or of legal quibbling. They go straight to\r\nthe point on the economic and common-sense issues involved. It is\r\ngratifying, moreover, to note occasionally that the dispute has already\r\nbeen informally settled before the Commission has time to render its\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nBy no means are all these decisions in favor of the shipper. In fact,\r\nduring the first fourteen months, only forty-six out of one hundred and\r\nseven formal cases were thus settled. The railroads enjoy no monopoly\r\nof unfair practices. Indeed, many of the rules, the exceptional\r\napplication of which works hardship, were originally provided to meet\r\nsome attempt at fraud by shippers. They might be under-classifying;\r\nseeking free storage on wheels pending sale of their goods; claiming\r\nexorbitant damages; or perpetrating any one of a thousand petty\r\nmeannesses to which human nature is liable. One or two instances of\r\nshippers' complaints set aside as unreasonable may not be out of place.\r\n\r\nThe Topeka banana dealers in 1908 complained that bananas _en route_\r\nfrom New Orleans were subject to an appreciable shrinkage in weight,\r\namounting to about six hundred pounds per car.[653] Inasmuch as about\r\nfourteen thousand cars were being moved annually, it is clear that\r\nthe aggregate loss of weight was considerable. The practice had been\r\nto weigh the bananas when transferred from the steamers at New Orleans\r\nto the cars, and to levy the freight rate upon this weight. To this\r\nthe dealers objected, instancing among other things the practice, long\r\nprevalent in the cattle business where a similar loss of weight in\r\ntransit occurs, of charging according to the weight of the shipments,\r\nnot at the initial point, but at the point of delivery. At first sight\r\nthe complaint appears to be well founded. Surely one should not be\r\ncompelled to pay freight on a greater lading than is carried. But the\r\nCommission on examination decided in favor of the roads. It was shown\r\nthat the service was most exceptional as to the shipment, handling and\r\nspeed; and it was held that the charges were on the whole reasonable\r\nand just.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important issues in which the railroads have won their\r\ncontention concerned the loading of lumber on flat cars.[654] For half\r\na century the practice has been that the shipper should provide his\r\nown lumber-stakes and pay freight on them as on the lumber itself. In\r\n1905 the National Lumbermen's Association tried to change all this, and\r\nto impose upon the carriers the legal duty of securing the loads in\r\nplace as they do with many other commodities. The carriers offered a\r\ncompromise, agreeing to allow five hundred pounds per car free for the\r\nweight of the stakes; but refused to accept responsibility for safely\r\nstowing the goods. The Commission, finally, after prolonged inquiry by\r\nexperts, relieved the carriers of this care and expense.\r\n\r\nIt is undeniable also that the carriers have found solace in certain\r\nunforeseen ways under the amended law. The rigid prohibition of all\r\nfavors and rebates has substantially raised the general level of\r\ncharges, so general was the practice of cutting rates a few years\r\nago. To be sure, this increase has affected principally the large\r\nshippers, thus tending to equalize opportunity between all grades\r\nof competitors. But over and above this, the prohibition of any act\r\ntainted with favoritism has enabled the carriers successfully to\r\nwithstand many leakages of revenue. Claims for damages can be plausibly\r\ndenied on the ground that their settlement might arouse suspicion, and\r\npossibly lead to prosecution for the grant of individual favors. Many\r\nroads have also actually augmented their revenues by this same line of\r\nargument. The custom of charging a merely nominal rental of one dollar\r\nfor freight-sheds, other buildings or land used for side-tracks or\r\nelevators, was formerly general. It would have been awkward to place\r\nthese contracts on a strictly commercial basis, especially where the\r\ntenants were shippers with the option of resorting to a rival line.\r\nBut on the plea that a continuance of these nominal rentals might be\r\nconsidered a criminal act of favoritism, substantial increases of\r\nrevenue have been obtained. On one road alone over three thousand of\r\nthese nominal rentals have been raised to strictly commercial figures.\r\nThe aggregate increase of revenue from this source has been by no means\r\ninconsiderable.\r\n\r\nA very important group of cases brought before the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission under the new law concerned the reasonableness\r\nof the various freight-rate advances which were occurring all along\r\nthe line.[655] This raised a question as to the absolute fairness\r\nof the new rates as against the interest of the general public. One\r\nconclusion is certain. The new law did not prevent the carriers from\r\npersisting in a policy, adopted nearly ten years earlier, after a\r\ngeneration of steadily declining rates, of quite generally putting up\r\ntheir charges. Unfortunately, the law of 1906 was defective in making\r\nno provision for dealing adequately with such cases. The Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission was limited in its scope to the consideration\r\nonly of specific complaints. It could not on its own initiative pass\r\nupon the reasonableness of an entire new schedule of rates in advance\r\nof its taking effect. It must take the matter up, if at all, bit\r\nby bit, as individual shippers chanced to complain, after the rates\r\nhave become operative. This abridgment of its power to pass upon the\r\nreasonableness of tariffs as a whole was effected in the Senate. It\r\nwas not contemplated either by President Roosevelt or by the House of\r\nRepresentatives. The result, as predicted, was that little protection\r\nwas afforded to the public in any large way. Judging by results, the\r\nrailroads were as free as they ever were, to increase their tariffs\r\nwhenever they saw fit so to do.\r\n\r\nThe imperative need of amending the law, and of granting power\r\nto suspend such rate advances, not merely in particular cases on\r\ncomplaint, but as to entire schedules of rates prior to their taking\r\neffect, was in fact met by the next set of amendments in 1910. The\r\nexperience of the intervening years amply proved the need of some such\r\namendment.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the changes after the new law went into effect may be\r\nindicated by a few typical instances. Few commodities are of greater\r\nimportance to the United States than chemical fertilizers, used in\r\nenormous quantities all over the country. The basis of these is\r\nphosphate rock. The freight rate on this from Tennessee to Chicago in\r\n1907 was $3.40 per ton. It was increased to $3.95, until the Commission\r\nordered its reduction to the old figure.[656] At the same time the\r\nOregon lumbermen had their rates to the East increased about one\r\nquarter, after a period of quiescence of six years. From the Willamette\r\nvalley to San Francisco--a test case soon to run a long course before\r\nthe courts[657]--lumber rates were $3.10. In 1907 they were put up to\r\nfive dollars. The Commission held that $3.40 was an adequate rate. The\r\nlast general increase had occurred in January, 1909, particularly in\r\ntranscontinental rates, where the fruit of the Harriman monopoly made\r\nitself felt. Not unduly great in the East, considering the increased\r\ncost of operation,--twenty-five cents per ton on pig iron and iron\r\npipe, for instance,--the Pacific Coast rates from New York rose often\r\nas high as fifty per cent. The rate on dry goods went up by one-third.\r\nTherein lay a part of the motive power for Union Pacific speculative\r\nfinance.[658] Among the most persistently contested schedules was that\r\nconcerning rates from the southwestern cattle ranges to the markets of\r\nthe Middle West.[659] In 1897 the rate on steers was twenty-seven cents\r\nper hundredweight. Step by step it went up to the level of thirty-six\r\nand one-half cents in 1903,--a rise of more than one-third within six\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nOccasionally one strikes an exorbitant rise in the East, however, as in\r\none instance where on imported iron pyrites used in making sulphuric\r\nacid, the rate, which in 1903 was $1.56, became $2.72 four years\r\nlater.[660] And the hardship often lay in the fact that these increases\r\nwere most marked in the case of the small shipper,--the very one who,\r\nin these days of large enterprises, we can least afford to spare. The\r\nrate on cotton goods from the South to the Pacific Coast rose only\r\nfifteen per cent, between 1896 and 1907 by the carload; for smaller\r\nlots it rose sixty-five per cent.[661] In 1907, 38,000,000 pounds of\r\ncheese were produced in southwestern Wisconsin. The shipper to Chicago\r\nby carload paid only about ten per cent, more in 1907 than eight years\r\nearlier; but the shipper in smaller lots was compelled to pay forty\r\nper cent. more.[662] As always, the change was along the line of least\r\nresistance. Such a policy made for larger dividends; but did it tend to\r\nthe perpetuation of equality of opportunity as between great and small\r\nconcerns? That was a social question of the very first importance,\r\nwhich had much to do with the demand for still further increase of the\r\nregulative power of the Federal government in 1910.\r\n\r\nUnder the new powers conferred by law, it was now possible to\r\ninvestigate scientifically many matters which heretofore had been\r\nprivately governed by rule of thumb. For instance the reasonableness\r\nof the charges for refrigeration in the movement of citrus fruit is\r\ndependent in practice upon the methods employed in gathering and\r\npacking them for market.[663] Was it better business practice to\r\nship oranges and lemons in ice-cooled refrigerator cars, or was it\r\nbetter to adopt the so-called pre-cooling process, combined with\r\ngreat care in handling? The former was the long-standing practice of\r\nthe fruit-growers, while the latter, substantially supported by the\r\ninvestment of more than a million dollars in plant, was advocated by\r\nthe carriers. One had been tested in practice, the other was yet in\r\nthe experimental stage. But aside from rivalry of method, were not the\r\nshippers entitled to pre-cool or refrigerate their fruit privately if\r\nthey so desired? The determination of this question meant an elaborate\r\ninvestigation with careful records in detail as to the results obtained\r\nin either case. The decision upheld the carriers in their charges\r\nfor the older methods of treatment; but pre-cooling charges had to\r\nbe reduced by seventy-five per cent. It appears, therefore, that\r\nauthority to deal with one of the most serious grievances voiced before\r\nthe Elkins Committee in 1905, may now be fairly and scientifically\r\nexercised for the public benefit.\r\n\r\nA similar technical investigation concerned the methods of transporting\r\nthe products of \"creameries.\"[664] Shall dairy products be centralized\r\nat favored points, possessed of a sufficient supply from the\r\nsurrounding territory to permit of large-scale manufacture; or shall\r\nthe older local creamery method prevail, whereby the product is taken\r\ndirectly from country stations to the great centres of consumption\r\nlike Chicago? The particular rate adjustment makes all the difference\r\nbetween creameries scattered throughout the countryside or, on the\r\nother hand, located in the great cities. One of the prime difficulties\r\nis in the sparsity and uneven distribution of the cow population. Here\r\nwas an order requiring a very careful investigation of the entire\r\nbusiness, followed by a nice judgment as to the economic merits of the\r\ncase. The history and development of the dairy business in the West\r\nhad to be thoroughly looked into. Quite irrespective of the resulting\r\norder, it is apparent that the public is certain to benefit from an\r\nexhaustive inquiry. Yet other general investigations of the same\r\nsort might be cited to the same end. The wool business was examined\r\nthoroughly in 1911.[665] The entire New England rate system as well\r\nas the conditions of operation were overhauled in the following year,\r\nand a general inquiry into the hard coal situation is just now under\r\nway. A general improvement of conditions is bound to flow from the free\r\nexercise of such general powers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe leading Supreme Court decision construing the Hepburn law,--and,\r\nconstitutionally, one of the most important in recent years,--was\r\nrendered in 1910 with reference to the relation between the exercise\r\nof power over transportation by the Interstate Commerce Commission and\r\nthe right of review of such action by the courts.[666] The details of\r\nthe controversy are indicative of the nicety of economic adjustment\r\nrequired in such cases. There was a shortage of equipment for the\r\ncarriage of soft coal on the lines of the Illinois Central Railroad.\r\nThis commodity, practically speaking; cannot be stored. It must be\r\ndisposed of at once, so that the available supply of cars determines\r\nthe output of each mine. If, in this case, all the cars had belonged\r\nto the Illinois Central Railroad to be used indiscriminately by the\r\nmine owners, it would have been a simple matter to have allotted the\r\nequipment among all the operators along its lines upon the basis of the\r\nestablished capacity of each. Unfortunately, diversity of ownership of\r\nthese cars had brought about, all over the country, special rules for\r\neffecting the allotments. Some cars belonged to the railroad; others\r\nto the mine company, to other private parties, or to foreign railways.\r\nCertain railroads first deducted all fuel carried by other equipment\r\nthan their own from the estimated capacity of each mine, and then\r\ndivided up their own available cars _pro rata_ among all the mines\r\naccording to the net capacity thus fixed. Others allotted their cars\r\naccording to the gross mine capacity, taking no account of the private\r\nor outside equipment which any particular coal mine possessed or might\r\nobtain. This second practice evidently favored the larger concerns,\r\nsupplied with abundant capital for investment in cars or for renting\r\nequipment. For, in addition to their own cars, they could still demand\r\nas many more from the railroad on daily allotment as if they were\r\nentirely dependent upon it for the movement of all their coal. Which\r\nwas the fairer practice? A nice economic question was thus raised. Has\r\na shipper the right to exclusive use of all his own fuel cars, and,\r\nin addition thereto, a full share of the system cars of the railroad?\r\nDisputes of this sort have been before the Commission and the courts\r\nfor years.\r\n\r\nIn this Illinois Central case, a colliery company complained of even a\r\nmore minute detail of the rule employed by the railroad in making its\r\ndaily allotment, affirming it to be discriminatory in effect. There was\r\na shortage of cars and of coal. The railroad was employing many of its\r\nown cars in the special service of carrying fuel for its own use. The\r\nparticular grievance was its insistence upon treating these special\r\nIllinois Central cars, for the purposes of allotment, as if they were\r\nmerely ordinary private cars; that is to say, by supplying them in\r\npractice regardless of and outside of the daily allotment, otherwise\r\nagreed upon. It thus appears that the economic issue was highly\r\ntechnical in character. Similar complaints had been already variously\r\ndecided by other tribunals. The Commission, moreover, was bound to\r\nconsider this complaint with several others of a like sort. Exercising\r\nits best business judgment under all the circumstances, it decided\r\nagainst the practice, ordering the Illinois Central, under the powers\r\nconferred by the new law of 1906, to include all cars, however owned or\r\nfor whatever purpose used, in figuring its daily allotments in time of\r\nshortage of equipment. The case went to the Supreme Court upon petition\r\nof the railroad to set aside the order of the Commission.\r\n\r\nBy contrast with the economic intricacy of this case, the fundamental\r\nlegal question was simple. How broad was the right of review of the\r\nCommission's order, as conferred by the amendments adopted in 1906?\r\nWere the courts to rest content merely to pass upon the regularity\r\nand lawfulness of the forms of procedure adopted by the Commission,\r\nor might they go further, and, hearing all the evidence as to fact,\r\nproceed to settle the economic controversy as well as the law\r\npoints, in entire independence of the Commission? In the former case\r\nadministrative control would result. In the latter, regulative power\r\nwould really reside in the judicial branch of the government. It was\r\nthe same old controversy which by adoption of the second alternative\r\nhad practically emasculated the law of 1887, and had necessitated\r\nits amplification by amendment in 1906.[667] A momentous issue was\r\npresented. To go forward would make for logical definition and\r\nseparation of the powers of the Federal government; to retreat would be\r\nto precipitate anew the inevitable conflict in Congress, from which, it\r\nwas hoped, we had emerged for good!\r\n\r\nThe importance of the Illinois Central decision is such that the\r\nconclusion should be stated by direct quotation, with our italics as to\r\nthe main point.\r\n\r\n    \"Beyond controversy, in determining whether an order of the\r\n    Commission shall be suspended or set aside, we must consider,\r\n    _a_, all relevant questions of constitutional power or right;\r\n    _b_, all pertinent questions as to whether the administrative\r\n    order is within the scope of the delegated authority under\r\n    which it purports to have been made; and, _c_, a proposition\r\n    which we state independently, although in its essence it\r\n    may be contained in the previous one, viz., whether, even\r\n    although the order be in form within the delegated power,\r\n    nevertheless it must be treated as not embraced therein,\r\n    because the exertion of authority which is questioned has been\r\n    manifested in such an unreasonable manner as to cause it, in\r\n    truth, to be within the elementary rule that the substance,\r\n    and not the shadow, determines the validity of the exercise\r\n    of the power. _Postal Telegraph Cable Co. v. Adams_, 155 U.\r\n    S., 688, 698. Plain as it is that the powers just stated are\r\n    of the essence of judicial authority, and which, therefore,\r\n    may not be curtailed, and whose discharge may not be by us in\r\n    a proper case avoided,[668] _it is equally plain that such\r\n    perennial powers lend no support whatever to the proposition\r\n    that we may, under the guise of exerting judicial power, usurp\r\n    merely administrative functions by setting aside a lawful\r\n    administrative order upon our conception as to whether the\r\n    administrative power has been wisely exercised. Power to make\r\n    the order and not the mere expediency or wisdom of having made\r\n    it, is the question._\"\r\n\r\nOn this cogent reasoning the Supreme Court, therefore, quite\r\nindependently of its opinion upon the economic merits, declined to\r\npermit interference with the order of the Commission.\r\n\r\nImmediately following the Illinois Central decision another was\r\nrendered concerning somewhat the same economic issue, namely methods\r\nof supplying coal cars on the Baltimore and Ohio.[669] The following\r\nquotation is significant of what promises to be the line of reasoning\r\nin future.\r\n\r\n    \"In ... the ... case just decided, it was pointed out that the\r\n    effect of the section was to cause it to come to pass that\r\n    courts, in determining whether an order of the Commission\r\n    should be suspended or enjoined, were without power to invade\r\n    the administrative functions vested in the Commission, and,\r\n    therefore, could not set aside an order duly made on a mere\r\n    exercise of judgment as to its wisdom or expediency. Under\r\n    these circumstances it is apparent, as we have said, that\r\n    these amendments of 1906 add to the cogency of the reasoning\r\n    which led to the conclusion in the Abilene Case, that the\r\n    primary interference of the courts with the administrative\r\n    functions of the Commission was wholly incompatible with the\r\n    act to regulate commerce. This result is easily illustrated.\r\n    A particular regulation of a carrier engaged in interstate\r\n    commerce is assailed in the courts as unjustly preferential and\r\n    discriminatory. Upon the facts found, the complaint is declared\r\n    to be well founded. The administrative powers of the Commission\r\n    are invoked concerning a regulation of like character upon\r\n    a similar complaint. The Commission finds, from the evidence\r\n    before it, that the regulation is not unjustly discriminatory.\r\n    Which would prevail? If both, then discrimination and\r\n    preference would result from the very prevalence of the two\r\n    methods of procedure. If, on the contrary, the Commission\r\n    was bound to follow the previous action of the courts, then\r\n    it is apparent that its power to perform its administrative\r\n    functions would be curtailed, if not destroyed. On the other\r\n    hand, if the action of the Commission were to prevail, then the\r\n    function exercised by the court would not have been judicial in\r\n    character, since its final conclusion would be susceptible of\r\n    being set aside by the action of a mere administrative body.\r\n    That these illustrations are not imaginary is established not\r\n    only by this record, but by the record in the case of the\r\n    _Illinois C. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission_.\"\r\n\r\nThese opinions, expressly recognizing the constitutionality of the free\r\nand full exercise of legislative power delegated by Congress beyond\r\nthe power of the courts to review, are of fundamental importance. Had\r\nthey been rendered a few days earlier, as we shall see, they might have\r\nprevented the supposed necessity of setting up a new commerce court\r\nby law in 1910. They would certainly have abridged the Congressional\r\ndebates over points of law. Under these decisions, only authority and\r\nconstitutional rights may be reviewed. The same issues were raised in\r\nthe Portland Gateway opinion in 1910, soon to engage our attention,\r\nconcerning the Commission's right to designate through routes for\r\npassenger travel. Over-ruling the Commission in this instance, however,\r\nthe narrow right of review by the courts, as laid down in the Illinois\r\nCentral case, is somewhat widened by an apparent refusal to treat the\r\nCommission's findings as to fact as conclusive in determining its\r\njurisdiction; however conclusive it may regard them in other respects.\r\nA shady byway of judicial encroachment is thus rather surreptitiously\r\nindicated.\r\n\r\nA more satisfactory re-affirmation of the disposition of the Supreme\r\nCourt to allow a wide field and a free hand to the Commission in\r\nthe exercise of its offices, is to be found in a third opinion, the\r\nso-called Burnham, Hanna, Munger case, also rendered in 1910.[670]\r\nCertain Missouri river cities complained that rates from the Atlantic\r\nseaboard were unduly high by comparison with those to cities in\r\nCentral Traffic territory, namely between the Mississippi river and\r\nBuffalo. The Commission held the complaint well founded; and ordered\r\na readjustment, by reduction of that portion of the rate west of\r\nthe Mississippi. Thus, by leaving the rates to the Central Traffic\r\nAssociation cities unchanged, it materially benefited those along\r\nthe Missouri river by comparison. Omaha and Kansas City were brought\r\nsubstantially closer to the seaboard as compared with Chicago and\r\nsimilar trade centres. The western roads, alone affected by this\r\norder, attacked it in the courts as an assertion by the Commission of\r\npower \"artificially to apportion out the country into zones tributary\r\nto given trade centres to be pre-determined by the Commission, and\r\nnon-tributary to others.\" The Supreme Court, in upholding the order,\r\nheld that it would indeed be an abuse of power to raise or lower rates\r\nfor the sole purpose above-outlined. Nevertheless, if the Commission\r\nwere seeking primarily to correct rates inherently unreasonable, such\r\naction would not be invalidated by incidental effects upon trade\r\nconditions. The Supreme Court found, therefore, that the order in\r\nquestion was within its power, as thus defined, and, governed by the\r\nreasoning in the Illinois Central case, held that the Commission's\r\ndecision could not be judicially reviewed upon the merits.\r\n\r\nThe line of judicial interpretation preceding the Mann-Elkins law of\r\n1910 has been even more rigidly followed by the Supreme Court since\r\nthat time. The most important decision, perhaps, was rendered in 1912.\r\nThis concerned the absolute reasonableness of rates on fir lumber from\r\nthe northern Pacific forests to the Middle West.[671] But it involved\r\nthe additional consideration that the transcontinental roads had in a\r\nmeasure guaranteed an economic status to lumbermen under which they\r\nhad made large investments, which, as they claimed, were jeopardized\r\nby an increase of freight rates in 1907. Two points were raised. One\r\nconcerned the reasonableness of the new rates _per se_; the other their\r\nreasonableness in the light of their effects upon an established yet\r\ndependent industry. It was the old issue, in brief, between cost of\r\nservice and value of service. A decision upon the latter basis alone\r\nmight have resulted, as in a similar action, in the Burnham, Hanna,\r\nMunger case, just outlined, in decreeing an extension of authority over\r\ncommerce by the Commission. Fortunately the court found otherwise in\r\nthese lumber cases. It was able to uphold the order of the Commission,\r\nwithout deviation from the path of reasoning laid down in the Illinois\r\nCentral opinion. The decision concludes as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"Considering the case as a whole, we cannot say that the order\r\n    was made because of the effect of the advance on the lumber\r\n    industry, nor because of a mistake of law as to presumptions\r\n    arising from the long continuance of the low rate when the\r\n    carrier was earning dividends, nor that there was no evidence\r\n    to support the finding. If so, the Commission acted within its\r\n    power, and, in view of the statute, its lawful orders cannot be\r\n    enjoined.\"\r\n\r\nThe unsatisfactory element in this decision is its implication that\r\nthe Commission must be governed by cost of service principles in\r\nfixing reasonable rates. For to admit the plea of the lumbermen, that\r\ntheir industry could not stand the increase, would obviously lend an\r\near to the principle of value of service. May the railroads properly\r\nadopt either of the two principles in fixing their tariffs, while the\r\nCommission is confined to cost of service alone? Any such conclusion\r\nwould tend to paralyze regulation. And Congress would certainly in a\r\nmoment fly to the rescue with amplification of the statute.\r\n\r\nThis Pacific coast lumber opinion also contains the following succinct\r\nstatement of the grounds upon which alone the Federal courts may review\r\nthe orders of the Commission:\r\n\r\n    \"There has been no attempt to make an exhaustive statement\r\n    of the principle involved, but in cases thus far decided, it\r\n    has been settled that the orders of the Commission are final\r\n    unless (1) beyond the power which it could constitutionally\r\n    exercise; or (2) beyond its statutory power; or (3) based\r\n    upon a mistake of law. But questions of fact may be involved\r\n    in the determination of questions of law, so that an order,\r\n    regular on its face, may be set aside if it appears that (4)\r\n    the rate is so low as to be confiscatory and in violation\r\n    of the constitutional prohibition against taking property\r\n    without due process of law; or (5) if the Commission acted so\r\n    arbitrarily and unjustly as to fix rates contrary to evidence,\r\n    or without evidence to support it; or (6) if the authority\r\n    therein involved has been exercised in such an unreasonable\r\n    manner as to cause it to be within the elementary rule that the\r\n    substance, and not the shadow, determines the validity of the\r\n    exercise of the power.\"\r\n\r\nQuite like the preceding case was another concerning the reasonableness\r\nof advances of rates upon fir lumber from the Willamette valley to San\r\nFrancisco. The Commission had ordered a reduced rate, from which the\r\nSouthern Pacific appealed to the Supreme Court.[672] This tribunal\r\nset aside the order on the ground that, while seeking to protect an\r\ninvestment in lumber mills, it had not been governed by considerations\r\nas to the intrinsic reasonableness of the rates. The lumbermen then\r\nwent back to the Commission with a new complaint, in response to\r\nwhich a slight advance was permitted to the railroad, apparently as\r\na token of compliance with the opinion of the Supreme Court. But the\r\nSouthern Pacific, not yet content, promptly appealed a second time\r\nunder the Mann-Elkins law to the new Commerce Court. On June 4, 1912,\r\nthis tribunal fully sustained the Commission in a most suggestive\r\ndeclaration of the obligation of a carrier, having once induced capital\r\nto embark in a new enterprise under promise of low rates, being\r\nsubsequently estopped from charging to the full limit of what the\r\ntraffic will bear.[673] This is a gratifying evidence of acquiescence\r\nof this new tribunal in the main line of interpretation laid down by\r\nthe Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nFederal decisions construing the law of 1906 during this period\r\nunder review, revealed various shortcomings and defects which could\r\nbe repaired only by additional legislation. They are to be considered\r\namong the causes contributing to the passage of the Mann-Elkins Act of\r\n1910, shortly to engage our attention. Two in particular, the Orange\r\nRouting case and the Portland Gateway order, merit discussion. Neither\r\ndirectly involved monetary considerations, but a conflict between the\r\nrights of shippers and carriers. And both alike went on appeal to the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Orange Routing case against the Southern Pacific Railroad touched\r\nthe right of the shipper to name the particular railways over which\r\nhis fruit should reach Eastern markets.[674] Rates were the same by\r\nwhatever route; but the railways denied the right of the shipper\r\nnot only to name, but even to know, the route taken by his goods in\r\ntransit. The same issue came up some years ago, concerning the right\r\nof cotton shippers at Memphis to designate the particular connecting\r\nrailroads which should haul their goods. The purpose of the carriers\r\nin seeking to control this matter is obvious, and may be praiseworthy.\r\nSecret rebates cannot often be secured by shippers from the initial\r\ncarriers, especially if, as in California, no railway competition\r\nexists. For the Atchison and the Southern Pacific have done away with\r\nthat by pooling their fruit business. Secret rebates, if secured by\r\nshippers at all, must be wrung from the connecting lines, which bid\r\nfor it at the great junction points, like Kansas City and Chicago.\r\nThe initial road, by reserving the right to route the freight, is\r\nable most effectively to nullify all such pernicious contracts. But,\r\non the other hand, this practice denies to the owner of the goods,\r\ncontrol, or even supervision, over his own. Market conditions may\r\neasily change while the goods are in transit. It may be desirable to\r\nstop them off at Chicago, or divert them to New Orleans. And, moreover,\r\ndamages for delay on such perishable goods as fruit are refused by\r\nthe terms of the contract. The routing road exercises power without\r\nassuming responsibility. On these grounds, and in consonance with the\r\nlong-established principles of common law, the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission held that the shippers' rights were jeopardized. It was\r\nshown that freight was often diverted from one road to another in\r\norder to secure more valuable percentages of the through rate for the\r\ninitial carrier. The Circuit Court in September, 1904, provisionally\r\nsustained the Commission; but its opinion was reversed by the Supreme\r\nCourt in 1906. The court of last resort failed to find in the law any\r\nprohibition of such regulations concerning routes by the railroads.\r\nIncidentally it held that the Federal courts might enforce orders of\r\nthe Commission, even although for reasons differing from those which\r\ngoverned the original order.[675]\r\n\r\nThe Portland Gateway case in 1910, before the Supreme Court,[676] also\r\ndisclosed a defect in the law of 1906. It dealt with the right of the\r\nCommission to designate through passenger routes. Seattle, Washington,\r\nmay be reached from the Middle West either by various lines to St. Paul\r\nand from thence due west by the \"Hill lines,\" or by various railroads\r\nto Kansas City and thence by the Burlington and the Northern Pacific,\r\nalso \"Hill lines.\" There are also many routes first proceeding westward\r\n_via_ the Union Pacific to Portland, Oregon, and from thence up to\r\nSeattle. By these latter routes most of the journey would be over the\r\n\"Harriman lines,\" whereas by the former it would be by way of their\r\ncompetitors for the control of the northwest. Passengers all the way\r\nover the \"Hill lines\" were afforded every facility for through travel\r\nin the way of tickets and baggage; but if they chose the Portland\r\nroute, great inconvenience followed from the refusal of the Hill lines\r\nto coöperate in facilities at the transfer point. In brief the \"Hill\r\nlines\" were working for the long haul over their own rails, as against\r\nthe merely local haul from Portland to Seattle, which would follow the\r\nchoice of the Harriman route.\r\n\r\nThe Commission upon its own motion investigated this situation, and,\r\nas a result, ordered the Northern Pacific to join with its rivals in\r\nestablishing through routes _via_ Portland to Seattle. This was done\r\nunder authority in the law of 1906 to establish through routes and\r\njoint rates, provided \"no reasonable or satisfactory through route\r\nexists.\" The Northern Pacific claimed, and was upheld therein by a\r\ndissenting opinion from the Commission, that there was already in\r\nexistence such a route. Quick and comfortable travel _via_ St. Paul\r\nalready existed. Some eight thousand persons annually for one reason or\r\nanother preferred, nevertheless, to go through Portland. The Commission\r\nheld that this preference was reasonable, and that accordingly, with\r\nrespect to such travellers, there was indeed no reasonable through\r\nroute in effect. Passenger traffic, involving the element of personal\r\nchoice, in other words, was different in law from freight business. The\r\nCircuit Court set aside this order upon the ground that a satisfactory\r\nalternative route over the Northern Pacific did actually exist. This\r\ndecree was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1910.\r\nBut it was a hard-won victory for the carriers, inasmuch as Congress\r\nwithin six months specifically authorized the Commission to regulate\r\nsuch matters in future, without limitation as to the existence of other\r\nsatisfactory routes.\r\n\r\nThe bitter rivalry between the Hill and Harriman systems for the\r\ncontrol of the Northwest, as affecting the routing of freight\r\ntraffic as well as of passengers through Portland, resulted in\r\ncarrying a second case of the same sort before the Supreme Court.\r\nMay temporary delay and congestion of business by way of any given\r\nline afford the Commission authority to designate another through\r\nroute! In this instance, the Supreme Court has affirmed the order of\r\nthe Commission.[677] It would appear, therefore, that this issue,\r\nfor the present at least, is closed. The regulative power of the\r\nFederal government over routes and the division of joint rates is\r\nsatisfactorily upheld.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeveral Supreme Court decisions defining the power of the Commission\r\nto require testimony, both oral and documentary, in relation to\r\nmatters which came before it, were rendered about this time. Its\r\nprestige and authority in this regard,--already affirmed in the late\r\nnineties,[678]--were considerably enhanced by an opinion delivered in\r\nApril, 1904.[679] In the course of the proceedings, upon complaint of\r\nWilliam R. Hearst against the Reading and other coal roads, certain\r\ncontracts between the Lehigh Valley Coal Company and independent\r\noperators were called for. One Baird and others, including President\r\nBaer of the Reading company, declined to produce these coal purchase\r\ncontracts. Others refused to testify concerning methods of fixing the\r\nprice for anthracite coal at tidewater. Disregarding certain purely\r\nlegal details, these refusals were based upon the contention that\r\nneither the Commission nor Hearst,--a well-known owner of various\r\nnewspapers,--had shown any legal interest in the complaint. The court\r\nheld, however, that the want of direct damage to the complainant was\r\nnot essential to his standing before the Commission. Moreover, in\r\nthis case, the Supreme Court overruled the Federal Circuit Court,\r\nwhich had held that the details of the contracts for purchase of\r\ncoal by railroads from independent operators related wholly to\r\nintrastate transactions,--that, in other words, the selling of coal\r\nin Pennsylvania had nothing to do with interstate commerce. The\r\nSupreme Court adjudged that all the details of these transactions had\r\na bearing upon the general question of the degree of monopoly in the\r\ncoal business, and could not properly be withheld from examination\r\nas evidence by the Commission. In conclusion the court said: \"To\r\nunreasonably hamper the Commission by narrowing its field of inquiry\r\nbeyond the requirements of the due protection of rights of citizens,\r\nwill be to seriously impair its usefulness and prevent a realization\r\nof the salutary purposes for which it was established by Congress.\"\r\nThis sweeping decision by the court of last resort well buttressed the\r\nformer decisions of that tribunal in the Brimson and Brown cases.\r\n\r\nThe so-called \"Immunity Bath\" Federal Court decision in 1906 materially\r\naffected, not so much the scope of authority of the Commission as\r\nits mode of procedure in eliciting testimony in railroad cases.[680]\r\nA resolution of the House of Representatives in 1904 had directed\r\nthe Commissioner of Corporations to conduct an investigation into\r\nthe affairs of the so-called \"Beef Trust.\" In the course of this\r\ninquiry, Federal officials from the bureau held interviews in Chicago\r\nwith prominent members of the beef-packing establishments. Important\r\nevidence was obtained, with the understanding that this was merely\r\na general investigation having no relation to the Department of\r\nJustice, nor intended to be used in the prosecution of any suits at\r\nlaw. At the same time, agents examined the books of these companies.\r\nThe accountants, however, in all cases refused to certify to their\r\naccuracy under oath. The material thus secured was incorporated in a\r\nreport of the bureau in the following year. Not long afterward, when\r\nthe prosecution of this combination was undertaken by the Department\r\nof Justice, the attorneys for the government made use of data in\r\nthis report of the Bureau of Corporations in presenting their case.\r\nConsequently, on behalf of the packers under indictment under the\r\nprovisions of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, it was urged that the\r\ninterdictions of this law were inoperative as to them, inasmuch as they\r\nhad virtually been made to testify against themselves. The District\r\ncourt affirmed this immunity from prosecution under the provision\r\nof the Constitution forbidding any person from being compelled in a\r\ncriminal case to be a witness against himself.[681]\r\n\r\nThe direct bearing of this decision upon subsequent prosecutions for\r\nrebating, as in the notable Chicago and Alton case in the following\r\nyear, is apparent. No general investigation of any subject, evidently,\r\ncould be undertaken either by Congress or the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission, in the course of which testimony had been elicited\r\nunder pressure, if it was intended that criminal prosecution by the\r\nDepartment of Justice was subsequently to take place. The eagerness\r\nof witnesses to secure the privileges of the \"Immunity Bath\" by frank\r\navowal of material facts might otherwise thwart the government in the\r\npursuance of its ends.\r\n\r\nAnother important decision of the Supreme Court touching the right of\r\nthe Commission to compel testimony was rendered in 1908 in connection\r\nwith the investigation of the Union Pacific system.[682] Mr. Harriman,\r\nthe dominant factor in the management of this system, had caused\r\nthe Union Pacific to purchase certain stocks of the Atchison and a\r\nnumber of other railroads in different parts of the country. The\r\npurchase price being known, the witness was asked whether he had a\r\npersonal interest in the securities thus acquired by the road under\r\nhis control. He declined to answer, on the ground that the power to\r\nrequire testimony was limited to the only cases where the sacrifice of\r\nprivacy was necessary, namely those where the investigation concerned a\r\nspecific breach of the law. The court, with three justices dissenting,\r\nsustained Harriman in his refusal, on the ground that this particular\r\ninvestigation was undertaken, not in pursuance of a complaint of\r\nspecific violation of the law, but merely for the sake of general\r\ninformation as to the manner and method in which the business of common\r\ncarriers was being conducted. No question was raised as to the right of\r\nthe Commission to undertake general investigations of this sort; it was\r\nmerely held that in the course of such investigations there was a limit\r\nto the inquisitorial power of this administrative body.\r\n\r\nIt may be added in this connection that the amendments added by the\r\nMann-Elkins Act of 1910 most specifically defined the authority of the\r\nCommission in this regard.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe \"commodity clause\" of the Hepburn amendments to the Interstate\r\nCommerce Law, because of its unfortunate ambiguity, has already twice\r\nbeen before the Supreme Court.[683] The first interpretation was given\r\nin a decision concerning the Delaware and Hudson Railroad, handed down\r\nin May, 1909.[684] This affirmed the constitutionality of the statute\r\nat all points; but, at the same time, emasculated it most effectually.\r\nFor, in order to harmonize the opinion with prior ones holding that\r\nownership of stock in a corporation did not constitute legal ownership\r\nof the property of the company, it was necessarily held that a railroad\r\nby owning the share capital of a coal company did not thereby possess\r\nan interest, direct or indirect, in the coal mined. Moreover, a\r\nrailroad which was the legal owner of coal at the mine might escape\r\nthe interdiction of the law by selling the coal before transportation\r\nbegan. A handy means of evading the intent of the law could not have\r\nbeen more plainly indicated.\r\n\r\nAn attempt specifically to prohibit stock ownership in coal mines by\r\nrailroads,--thus meeting in part the situation arising out of the\r\nforegoing decision,--was made in connection with the Mann-Elkins Act\r\nin 1910; but to no avail. The Senate, by a vote of twenty-five to\r\nthirty-one, rejected an amendment proposed by Senator Bailey of Texas,\r\nto prohibit stock ownership so clearly \"that not even a judge of the\r\nSupreme Court could fail to understand it.\" The negative votes were\r\nall cast by the so-called \"regular\" Republicans. In the meantime, the\r\nclause had been carried to the Supreme Court for further interpretation\r\nin a suit against the Lehigh Valley Railroad.[685] The government\r\nin the lower court had already been defeated in an attempt to raise\r\nquestions of fact as to the pecuniary interest of the road in the\r\ncoal transported, irrespective of the technicalities as to legal\r\nownership. The outcome in this case was more satisfactory. The Circuit\r\nCourt was held to have erred in ruling out these considerations. It\r\nwas unanimously decided by the Supreme Court that it was in violation\r\nof the law to use stock ownership for the purpose of destroying the\r\nentity of a producing corporation, while still so \"commingling\" its\r\naffairs in administration with the affairs of the railroad as to make\r\nthe two corporations virtually one. This was a distinct gain for the\r\ngovernment. It necessitated a compliance with the law in good faith.\r\nUpon the basis of this decision the Department of Justice instituted\r\na new action against the Lehigh Valley Road, which was promptly met,\r\nhowever, by a readjustment of its corporate affairs.\r\n\r\nThe economic results under the \"commodity clause\" have been quite\r\ndifferent from those doubtless anticipated by Congress. A salutary\r\nseparation of coal mining from transportation is being effected; but in\r\nthe case of the anthracite properties at least, in such manner as to\r\nhold out small hope of any direct benefit to the general public.\r\n\r\nAbsolute alienation of their coal properties by the railroads was\r\nsubject to two difficulties. Some roads, like the Reading and the\r\nLehigh Valley, had heavy issues of bonds outstanding, based upon the\r\nsecurity, jointly, of both the railroad and the coal properties.\r\nThe two could not readily be separated without retirement of these\r\ngeneral mortgage bonds. In the second place, the operating relations\r\nbetween the railroads and their subsidiary coal companies, had for\r\nyears been fixed upon the general principle of concentrating all\r\nprofit from the two conjoined transactions of mining and carriage upon\r\nthe transportation service alone. In other words, freight rates were\r\nestablished at so high a percentage of the selling price of coal that\r\nmining was necessarily conducted at a nominal profit, if any. This\r\nmade no difference to the carriers, owning both mines and roads, but\r\nit had the desired effect of making it impossible for coal operators,\r\nindependent of the railroads, to engage in the business. Without a\r\nmodification of this plan the coal companies, already separately\r\norganized for the business by most of the railroads, could hardly be\r\ndisposed of to advantage, either to the general public or even to their\r\nown shareholders. The only coal companies controlled by railroads which\r\nindependently showed a considerable book-keeping profit were those\r\nowned by the Jersey Central and the Delaware and Hudson roads. The\r\nLehigh Valley Coal Company had never paid dividends to its railroad\r\ncorporation, but had contented itself with providing a very profitable\r\ntonnage. The Philadelphia and Reading Coal and Iron Company had\r\nlikewise never been allowed to show a book-keeping profit sufficient\r\nto meet the interest upon its bonds and to provide for a sinking fund\r\nagainst exhaustion of its assets under ground.\r\n\r\nDespite these practical obstacles, a general legal separation\r\nof hard-coal mining from transportation is in a fair way to be\r\neffected.[686] The Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western in 1909 was the\r\nfirst to act. With no joint mortgages and a charter right to mine coal\r\ndirectly, it merely organized a separate corporation, the Delaware,\r\nLackawanna and Western Coal Company. The capital stock of this concern\r\nwas then distributed gratis as a special dividend among its own\r\nshareholders. This coal company at once purchased all of the railroad's\r\ncoal in stock, leased its mining appurtenances, and agreed henceforth\r\nto purchase all of its coal at the mine mouth for sixty-five per cent.\r\nof the tidewater price. The railroad continued to mine coal, but thus\r\ndisposed of it before accepting it again for carriage. The Delaware and\r\nHudson likewise entered into a contract with a coal company organized\r\nin 1901, which, after June, 1909, agreed to purchase all of its future\r\noutput. The Lehigh Valley Railroad rearrangement was more complicated.\r\nIt already had a coal company of the same name, the capital stock\r\nof which was pledged under its general railroad mortgage. Ownership\r\nwas thus indissoluble. So the Lehigh Valley _Coal Sales_ Company was\r\norganized in January, 1912. Its capital of $10,000,000 was provided by\r\nthe railroad, which declared a stock dividend to its own shareholders,\r\nsufficient in amount to enable them to subscribe to the capital of\r\nthe new concern. This company, then, like the others above mentioned,\r\nthereupon agreed to purchase all the coal mined by the railroad's\r\nsubsidiary coal corporation.\r\n\r\nAt this writing great speculative interest attaches to the probable\r\nplan to be adopted by the Reading. Its intricate organization,[687]\r\nwhereby both the railroad and the coal companies are owned by a purely\r\nfinance or holding company, renders the problem of dissociation unique.\r\nA large volume of joint bonds are outstanding, with complicated\r\nprovisions for sinking funds. The railroad actually owns no coal lands.\r\nThe coal company, independently, is not profitable under existing\r\ntraffic arrangements. Its operating ratio in 1911 was 98.7 per cent.\r\nIt is \"land poor\"; carrying vast reserves of coal purchased by bond\r\nissues. The only asset sufficiently profitable by itself to make it\r\nattractive as a gift to shareholders, is the subsidiary coal company\r\nof the Jersey Central Railroad, which is itself controlled by means of\r\nstock ownership. The formation of a third coal sales company, whose\r\nstock could be distributed to shareholders of the Reading, as was done\r\nby the Lehigh Valley, would seem to be the only feasible plan.\r\n\r\nBut is there not danger, financially, for these and other railroads,\r\nthat they may place this lucrative traffic in jeopardy by thus\r\ndistributing their coal properties among shareholders by means of stock\r\ndividends? While, for a time, community of interest between railroad\r\nand coal mine may be assured through lodgment of stock ownership of\r\nboth companies in the same persons, is it not likely that the two may\r\nbecome widely dissociated in the course of time? This contingency\r\nhas been guarded against by an ingenious provision. The contracts\r\nproviding for purchase and shipment of coal by the coal sales companies\r\nare terminable at the will of the railroad. So that if conflict of\r\ninterest should arise in future, through transfers of stock of the coal\r\nsales company to outsiders, the carriers would be free to cancel the\r\narrangement; create another corporation; distribute its shares among\r\ntheir stockholders once more; and thereafter go on as before. Manifold\r\nand ingenious, indeed, are the devices of the law for purposes of\r\ncircumvention!\r\n\r\nWhether the \"commodity clause\" is to bring about a further separation\r\nof transportation from activities of carriers in other lines of\r\nbusiness remains to be seen. It was doubtless intended to have a\r\ngeneral application. Some roads, other than those in the anthracite\r\ncoal fields, have taken steps to set off their subsidiary concerns.\r\nThe Louisville & Nashville, for example, has distributed among its\r\nstockholders all the shares of the Louisville Properties Company. This\r\nis a Kentucky corporation to which the railroad had transferred its\r\nholdings of coal and other lands. It was expected at the time that\r\nits capital stock of $600,000 would be worth par. The Union Pacific\r\nhas done even better. It voluntarily reconveyed to the United States\r\nconsiderable tracts of coal lands, where title had been called in\r\nquestion in the course of investigations as to such railroad ownership.\r\nWhile there has been no sign of the Pennsylvania Railroad disposing of\r\nits investments in the Cambria and Pennsylvania Steel Companies, made\r\nprior to 1906, it is clear that the interdiction of the law will render\r\nany further outside operations of this sort difficult if not impossible.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[629] _Cf._ the record for 1898-1900 at p. 486, _supra_.\r\n\r\n[630] Annual Report I.C.C., 1909, p. 11.\r\n\r\n[631] P. 324, _supra_.\r\n\r\n[632] 16 I.C.C.

For some\r\ntime the railroads seemed submissive,--in almost a chastened mood. The\r\nCommission also exercised its new powers rather timidly. Up to July\r\n1, 1908, only a single appeal to the Federal courts had been taken\r\nby the carriers against orders of the Commission. A sudden change of\r\nfront supervened at this time. During the second half of that year,\r\nsixteen suits to set aside orders of the Commission were filed. Nine\r\nmore were entered in the following year, and thirteen during 1910; with\r\nthe result that the dockets were greatly congested with proceedings of\r\nthis sort. No less than thirty-six were before the circuit courts, when\r\nin 1910 they were all transferred to the newly constituted Commerce\r\nCourt, soon to be described. This accumulation of unfinished business,\r\nwith the consequent delay in settlement of important transportation\r\ndisputes, contributed greatly to the movement in Congress in favor of\r\nfurther amendment of the law.\r\n\r\nThere were several reasons for this sudden shift of attitude toward\r\nthe law in 1908 on the part of the carriers. The political atmosphere\r\nhad suddenly cleared so far as popular hostility to railroads was\r\nconcerned. A change of administration had ensued, with a marked\r\npreponderance of professional legal talent in the Cabinet. And several\r\nimportant decisions of the Supreme Court, once threatening, had now\r\nbeen rendered in favor of the carriers. Among these may be mentioned\r\nthe first interpretation of the \"commodity clause,\"--on the one\r\nhand upholding the constitutionality of the law, and on the other,\r\npointing the broad and easy way to its evasion; the Harriman decision,\r\nprotecting witnesses from disclosure of details as to their personal\r\nparticipation in the finances of companies under their control; and\r\nthe exculpation of the Standard Oil Company by the aid of eminent\r\ncounsel and the technicalities of the law, with escape from the extreme\r\npenalties of the statutes for rebating and personal favoritism. Things\r\nseemed indeed to be going at last the railroads' way.\r\n\r\nThe brightening financial outlook also gave better heart to the\r\ncarriers. The panic of 1907, with its forced postponement of\r\nambitiously constructive plans, seemed to have passed. The revival of\r\nthese projects might be hampered by a further extension of government\r\nregulation and publicity. Railroad labor, moreover, was becoming\r\nrestive. Demands for increased wages were imminent; and the carriers\r\nevidently proposed to shift the incidence of these wage increases,\r\nif granted, upon the public by means of an advance of rates. Such\r\nincreases were bound to be disputed. It was deemed important to\r\ntest the law at every point. This need was the more imperative as\r\nthe Commission itself was bound to pass upon several questions of\r\nfundamental importance, such as the adjustment of transcontinental\r\nfreight schedules and others soon to be described.\r\n\r\nA presidential campaign took place in 1908. Both political parties\r\ncommitted themselves in their platforms to still further amendment of\r\nthe Interstate Commerce Law. The Republican party, however, modestly\r\nconfined its recommendations to authorization of traffic agreements\r\nand the regulation of stock and bond issues by railroads for the\r\nprevention of over-capitalization. The Democrats offered a much broader\r\nprogram providing for real amplification of the power of the Commission\r\nover rates. President Taft,--well in advance of his party, controlled\r\nas it was by the so-called \"regulars,\"--offered soon after election a\r\nmore definite policy. Its main feature was the establishment of a Court\r\nof Commerce to which all judicial review of orders of the Commission\r\nshould be submitted, in lieu of revision by the regularly constituted\r\nFederal judiciary. He evidently proposed to seriously amend the law;\r\nbut, beyond the foregoing proposition, most of the other details of\r\nhis plan seemed to be either half-way measures or else ill-designed\r\nto meet the real difficulties of the case. Thus the proposal to give\r\npower over mere rules and regulations in advance of their taking\r\neffect, without at the same time conferring a like power to pass upon\r\nthe reasonableness of rates themselves, seemed to miss the main point.\r\nThe same criticism was applicable to the plan of conferring authority\r\nto postpone the taking effect of a new classification until it had\r\nbeen approved by the Commission. Other excellent details were such as\r\nconferred authority to compel through routes and to forbid stockholding\r\nby one road in other competing lines, set forth in speeches in the fall\r\nof 1909.\r\n\r\nA special presidential message of January 7, 1910, contained the\r\nspecific program recommended for legislation to Congress. It consisted\r\nmerely of a tentative bill, which was introduced in both houses and\r\nproperly referred.[688] By this time the influence of the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission in strengthening the proposals was apparent. More\r\npositive provisions were added, such as the right to suspend rate\r\nincreases pending determination of their reasonableness. Serious\r\nconsideration was given this bill in appropriate committees both\r\nof the House and Senate. It was, in fact, with the consent of the\r\nAttorney-General, amended out of all semblance to its original form.\r\nThe most serious changes were made in the Committee on Interstate\r\nCommerce of the House of Representatives. The coalition of Democrats\r\nand \"insurgent\" or \"progressive\" Republicans, succeeded in striking\r\nout the authorization of traffic agreements, as well as a proposition\r\npermitting a railroad owning a majority of stock in other non-competing\r\nlines to purchase the balance of their shares. Several radical\r\namendments of the Commerce Court plan were likewise effected,\r\nespecially those giving the power of appointment to the Chief Justice\r\ninstead of the President. The hands of the \"progressives\" in all this\r\nwork were considerably strengthened, without doubt, by the course of\r\nevents during the spring months of 1910, especially the impending\r\ngeneral increase of freight rates all over the country.\r\n\r\nThe strength of political sentiment in favor of the measure appears\r\nin the fact that the radical House bill was passed unanimously;\r\nwhile the Senate bill was adopted by a solid Republican vote with\r\nthe aid of six Democrats,--the total vote being fifty to eleven.\r\nReference to a conference committee, which considered it for ten\r\ndays, still further modified the original plan. Pooling was dropped\r\nentirely; stock-watering and details of inter-corporate finance\r\nbetween non-competing lines were also thrown but as favoring the\r\ncarriers unduly. Physical valuation, as provided in the House bill,\r\nwas considerably restricted. Prompt approval of the conference bill\r\nfollowed in both houses. And the signature of the President was added\r\non June 18. Thus did the Mann-Elkins \"Amendments\" become law.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe three most important features of the Mann-Elkins Act[689] were:\r\nthe grant of power to suspend changes in rates for examination as to\r\ntheir reasonableness; resuscitation of the long and short haul clause;\r\nand the creation of the Commerce Court for review of the Commission's\r\norders. Of these, the first two represent substantial extension of the\r\nregulative power of the government; the third being a mere modification\r\nof procedure on appeal.\r\n\r\nThe proposition to so amend Section 15[690] of the Act of 1887 as\r\nto confer power upon the Commission to suspend proposed changes\r\nin rates, seems to have been a feature added at the behest of the\r\ninsurgent-Democratic coalition in Congress. It was neither in the\r\nPresident's first unofficial program nor in the formal bill drawn\r\nup by the Attorney-General. The intolerable obstructions in the way\r\nof prompt determination of transportation disputes incident to the\r\npractical working of the law, even since 1906, had created a renewed\r\ndemand for relief. Great force was added to this demand among shippers\r\nby the rate advances which had been occurring all along the line for\r\ntwo years; and particularly by the rumors of a general rate advance\r\nby the western and trunk line roads during the progress of the debate\r\nupon the bill. The President, to be sure, blocked this advance by means\r\nof a clever legal and political move. On May 31 an injunction was\r\nissued against twenty-four carriers, temporarily restraining them from\r\nputting into effect higher tariffs, as they had planned on June 1. This\r\naction was taken upon the allegation that the simultaneous action of\r\nall these roads in so doing constituted a violation of the Anti-Trust\r\nLaw. The injunction, which as a weapon had been turned mainly by the\r\ncarriers against enforcement of the orders of the Commission, was now\r\ninvoked against the railroads. Regardless as to whether a _bona fide_\r\nprosecution was contemplated, the effect of these equity proceedings\r\nwas to secure postponement of the advance in rates; and, of course,\r\nat the same time forcibly to attract the attention of Congress to the\r\nnecessity of control. The carriers withdrew their tariffs in some\r\ndiscomfiture; the injunctions were dissolved; and all proceedings were\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary, perhaps, to repeat the demonstration that a loss\r\nby shippers once incurred through payment of an unreasonable rate, is\r\nirretrievable. The manner in which transportation costs enter into the\r\nprofitableness of contracts by the shipper for future delivery is well\r\nknown.[691] Any change of rates during a period for which shippers\r\nhave contracted to deliver at fixed prices, must seriously affect\r\nthe chances of profit. It was recognized as essential, therefore,\r\nthat adequate protection for the shipper could be given only through\r\nsuspension of any change in rates until the reasonableness of that\r\nchange had been determined.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which the aid of the courts had been invoked by the\r\ncarriers to set aside orders of the Commission has already been\r\ndescribed. Proceedings on the equity side in the courts had also,\r\nalthough in a most unsatisfactory manner, been undertaken to restrain\r\nadvances in rates. But in all cases the exercise of this power had\r\nbeen bitterly contested, and proved at best to be so cumbersome as to\r\nbe almost futile. The utmost confusion resulted in some cases. For\r\nexample, in 1908 the carriers filed notice of an advance in rates\r\non boots and shoes from New England to the South. An injunction was\r\nobtained prohibiting such advance, on condition that application be\r\nimmediately made to the Commission for a ruling upon the reasonableness\r\nof the proposed change. This would have left the carriers without\r\nchoice except to collect one rate while continuing to publish another.\r\nThey therefore withdrew their schedules, leaving the old rates in\r\neffect. As a result no complaint could be filed with the Commission,\r\nthe new rate not having come into operation. To meet this situation,\r\nthe court then so modified its injunction that carriers might publish\r\nthe advanced schedule, but were restrained from collecting it. This was\r\nmanifestly an absurd situation. Moreover, supposing that the Commission\r\ncould immediately take up the question, no order could become effective\r\nuntil after thirty days. In the meantime, the whole matter must remain\r\nin suspense. Considering that 15,000 tariffs advancing rates in trunk\r\nline territory alone, were filed in July, 1910, the necessary delay\r\nincident to such roundabout procedure would render it intolerable.\r\nOther complications might be mentioned, such as the localization of\r\ninjunctions within the territorial jurisdiction of the enjoining court;\r\nlegal technicalities touching the filing of bonds; and the status of\r\nnon-petitioning shippers. Speedy relief must be had: that was clear\r\nbeyond question.\r\n\r\nAside from the practical unworkableness of the injunction process as\r\na protection against unreasonable rate advances, reform might well be\r\ndemanded on grounds of fairness. No reduction of rates ought to be\r\ncompelled without opportunity for protest by the carrier. Contrariwise,\r\nno new burden should be laid upon the shipper without a hearing. The\r\nburden of proof against disturbance of a long-standing adjustment ought\r\nproperly to rest upon the party responsible for the change. Such delay\r\nas was requisite for determination of the reasonableness of the change\r\ncould not constitute a serious burden; and even if it did, it was but\r\njust under the attendant circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe new law yielded to these arguments by a radical extension of the\r\nauthority of the Commission. It was authorized to suspend the taking\r\neffect of any new rate or regulation for not more than one hundred\r\nand twenty days, to afford opportunity for hearing and decision as\r\nto its reasonableness. If necessary, a further period of six months'\r\nsuspension might be had. Moreover, the burden of proof that the\r\nchange was just and reasonable was laid upon the carrier. Beyond\r\nthe ten months' period thus allowed, postponement might not extend.\r\nThereafter the rates became effective automatically. This control\r\nfell short of the demand of the \"insurgents\" that downright approval\r\nof the Commission for all changes should be required; but it was,\r\nnevertheless, a substantial increase of power. It remains to be seen\r\nwhat the practical result of this great extension of government control\r\nmay be. It was predicted that its greatest benefit would come from\r\nthose suspensions of rate advances which ultimately brought about their\r\nwithdrawal.[692] This prophecy was fulfilled, as will be seen in the\r\nnext chapter, in the first great test to which the law was put, almost\r\nimmediately after its passage.\r\n\r\nResuscitation of the long and short haul clause of the Act of 1887\r\nwas the second important feature of the new legislation. The long and\r\ntedious process of judicial interpretation, by means of which this\r\nsection of the statute was nullified for so many years, has already\r\nbeen set forth.[693] Dissatisfaction with the local discrimination\r\nprevalent throughout the southern states and in the Rocky mountain\r\nregion had been steadily increasing for a long time. Public opinion in\r\nthese districts urgently demanded the relief which the original law\r\nsought to afford. Chairman Knapp fairly described the situation in\r\n1905 before the Elkins Committee as follows:[694]--\"No one, I think,\r\ncan read the Fourth section ... and be in doubt that Congress intended\r\nto provide some actual and potential restraint upon that particular\r\nform of discrimination. And, I may say, it remains today much as it\r\nwas then, not the greatest evil, but the most irritating and obnoxious\r\nform of discrimination that has been encountered.\" No distributing\r\nbusiness could hope to become established in the West or South without\r\nvitalizing this section of the law. The larger cities, and particularly\r\nthe manufacturing districts in the East, on the other hand, viewed\r\nwith alarm any encroachment upon the far distant markets which they\r\nwere able to hold by reason of peculiarly low rates. The railroads'\r\ncoöperation with eastern representatives in Congress had successfully\r\nprevented any change in 1906. But four years later it became apparent\r\nearly in the debates that something would have to be done for the\r\nrelief of the West and South.\r\n\r\nThe long and short haul clause was amended by the influence of the\r\nProgressive Republicans in the House.[695] Four changes were made. The\r\nfirst was the total elimination of the clause \"under substantially\r\nsimilar circumstances and conditions,\" which had been responsible for\r\nalmost all of the trouble in the courts. This change made it necessary\r\nin all cases in future for permission to be secured in advance from the\r\nCommission for any lesser charge for a long haul than for a shorter\r\none, no matter what the local circumstances might be. Secondly,\r\nthe prohibition was specifically made to cover \"routes\" as well as\r\n\"lines.\" Although the Osborne case[696] had already virtually made it\r\nclear that the clause applied to a series of connecting railways as\r\nwell as to a single company, this addition placed the matter beyond\r\ndispute. The third change, practically legalizing a standing rule of\r\nthe Commission for many years, prohibited a higher through rate than\r\nthe sum of the local charges over the same line.[697] An addition\r\ncovering an entirely new point constituted the fourth modification of\r\nthe section. It is suggestive as an indication of the determined spirit\r\nwhich animated Congress. This last detail was borrowed from the then\r\nrecently submitted report of the National Waterways Commission, which\r\nin turn had borrowed it from the state constitution of California. It\r\nwas intended to meet the tactics so often adopted by land carriers\r\nin competition with water lines, of drastically reducing rates until\r\nthe competition by water had been killed, after which the losses were\r\nrecouped by even higher tariffs than before.[698] Under the new law,\r\nno railroad, having once reduced its rates in competition with a water\r\nroute, was permitted to increase those charges until the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission should have found that such proposed increase\r\nrested upon changed conditions other than the elimination of water\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nImprovement of the procedure on appeal, by the establishment of the\r\nCommerce Court, was the third important feature of the new law.\r\nIt was not only the delay of which complaint was made, but the\r\nillogical process of review as well. For this permitted the orders\r\nof a technically expert commission of seven men to be set aside by\r\nthe order of a single judge who, in fact, relied upon subordinates\r\nfor an examination of the evidence as to economic fact. This may be\r\nillustrated by two recent cases. In 1907 the transcontinental railroads\r\nsubstantially increased their rates on lumber. The Commission held\r\nthat this advance was unreasonable; but permitted one half of it to\r\ntake place. The carriers appealed to the Federal Circuit Court. All\r\nthe evidence, involving great money and commercial considerations,\r\nwas taken for the court by a master. Upon the findings of this single\r\nindividual, without opportunity for the court to critically examine\r\nthe evidence, the deliberate judgment of the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission was set aside. The same thing happened in the Texas Cattle\r\nRaisers' case in 1910, involving rates on live stock from the southwest\r\nto northern ranges. In this instance, to be sure, the Circuit Court\r\ndeclined to enjoin the Commission. That did not, however, alter the\r\nfact that the decision was based upon hearings by a master, extending\r\nover sixty-three days and rolling up a voluminous record which the\r\ncourt did not have time even to peruse cursorily. To standardize\r\nprocedure, as well as to eliminate delay, was the purpose of the\r\nPresident in the plan for the Commerce Court.\r\n\r\nMany objections were advanced in the course of debate in Congress\r\nagainst the creation of a special tribunal. It was urged that such a\r\ncourt with limited jurisdiction would be open to political influence,\r\nas well as exposed to the danger of narrowness. It was said to be\r\nforeign to our judicial organization, which heretofore had known\r\nonly courts of general jurisdiction. It was stated that no necessity\r\nfor a commerce court existed, so small would be the number of cases\r\nwhich might be brought before it. Objection was also raised to it on\r\nthe ground of expense. The problem of court review was, of course,\r\ncomplicated rather than made more simple by the Hepburn Act of 1906.\r\nPrior to that time no administrative orders took effect other than\r\nthrough enforcement by the courts. But this law provided that rates\r\nand regulations of the Commission should take effect _proprio vigore_\r\nwithin thirty days. The contest over broad _v._ narrow court review\r\nhas already been described, with the outcome at the time regarded\r\nas a victory for broad review. The situation was entirely changed,\r\nhowever, by the Illinois Central decision in 1910,[699] which appeared\r\nto put a restraint upon judicial review, except when the order of the\r\nCommission was either beyond its legal powers or else unconstitutional.\r\nThis decision did not, as might have been expected, put an end to the\r\nplan for a new transportation court; but it did bring about a specific\r\nrestriction of the powers of this tribunal to those possessed by the\r\nregular circuit courts.\r\n\r\nThe Commerce Court, as finally constituted in 1910, was composed of\r\nfive judges, each to serve for five years, designated and assigned\r\nthereto by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court from among the\r\ncircuit judges of the United States. No member might serve continuously\r\nfor more than one term, but might be reappointed after an interval of\r\none year. The court was to sit at Washington, and was to be always\r\nopen for the transaction of business. From it, direct appeal to the\r\nSupreme Court might be taken, with as simple a mode of procedure as\r\npossible to eliminate delay. The original record, for example, was\r\nto be transmitted; and agents of every carrier must be designated at\r\nWashington upon whom process might at any time be served. Whatever may\r\nbe said of other details of this judicial experiment, it certainly\r\nsought in good faith to promote promptness in procedure.\r\n\r\nThe jurisdiction of this Commerce Court was expressly conferred over\r\nfour kinds of cases:[700]\r\n\r\n_First_, those for enforcement of any order of the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission, other than the payment of money.\r\n\r\n_Second_, cases brought to enjoin, set aside, annul or suspend, in\r\nwhole or in part, any order of the Commission.\r\n\r\n_Third_, all proceedings on appeal under the Elkins amendments of 1903\r\nwith reference to rebates or departure from the published tariffs.\r\n\r\n_Fourth_, all proceedings concerning the enforcement of the law in\r\nrespect of publicity of accounts, the furnishing of facilities, or\r\ncompulsion in the movement of traffic.\r\n\r\nProceedings in the first class above mentioned, for enforcement of\r\norders of the Commission, remained practically unchanged in form,\r\nexcept that they were to be prosecuted in the Commerce Court instead of\r\nin the ordinary circuit courts. Cases of the second sort, wherein the\r\ncarrier sought to enjoin or set aside orders of the Commission, were\r\nsomewhat modified in procedure. The Administration bill provided that\r\nthe Commerce Court should not issue injunctions, except in cases where\r\nirreparable damage would follow. In this regard, the Senate succeeded\r\nin somewhat amplifying judicial control. Five days' preliminary notice\r\nto the Commission, secured in 1906 after a bitter contest, was now\r\ncut down to three days; and the full court might extend the temporary\r\nstay of sixty days granted by a single judge, over the entire period\r\nnecessary for final decision by the Supreme Court. With this exception,\r\nthe new law held all the ground gained by the Hepburn Act as judicially\r\ninterpreted in the Illinois Central case.\r\n\r\nThe principal criticism which may be directed against the Commerce\r\nCourt, as thus organized, is that, instead of being an unchanging body\r\nof judges, becoming expert in the details of transportation by long\r\nexperience, its membership must change year by year. Fortunately, at\r\nthe outset the court was favored by the appointment, as presiding\r\njustice, of the Chairman of the Interstate Commerce Commission; but it\r\nseems likely that the lack of experience and technical knowledge in\r\nthis ever-changing body may render it an obstruction rather than an\r\nassistance in fixing the responsibility for the settlement of these\r\nimportant cases. Specialization ought to be as beneficial here as in\r\nall other departments of government. It is a pity that the original\r\nplan of a permanent court should finally have been changed, through the\r\ninsistence of the carriers' representatives, to a tribunal, each of\r\nwhose members no sooner becomes proficient in the details of his work\r\nthan he is marked for transfer to other fields of activity.\r\n\r\nNext to the creation of the Commerce Court, the most important\r\nchange in procedure introduced in 1910 was the transfer of the task\r\nof prosecuting suits on appeal cases from the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission to the Federal Department of Justice. The confusion of\r\ngovernmental powers in the past, through permitting the Commission\r\nto prosecute cases in the Federal courts in which it already had an\r\ninterest, has already been described. It was obviously illogical that\r\na body having once rendered an opinion should then appear in court in\r\ndefence of its own order. The jealousy of the Department of Justice\r\nin this regard was probably responsible also for the change effected\r\nin the law. The amendment of 1910 provides that hereafter all cases\r\nand proceedings, either in the Commerce Court or the Supreme Court,\r\nshall be brought in the name of the United States under the charge\r\nand control of the Attorney-General. It was provided also that the\r\nCommission or \"any party or parties in interest\" might appear of their\r\nown motion and as of right, and might be represented by counsel.\r\nCommunities, associations, or individuals interested in the controversy\r\nwere authorized to intervene, and the Attorney-General was forbidden\r\nto discontinue any proceedings over the objection of such parties in\r\ninterest.[701] This apparently reasonable procedure was authorized\r\nafter vehement protest of shippers against the original administration\r\nprogram. The Senate objected to it on the ground that it \"would\r\nintroduce intolerable confusion in legal proceedings and subordinate\r\nthe general interests of all the people to the selfish concerns of one\r\nor more parties.\" And the Commission insisted throughout that it must\r\nparticipate in such suits, else no competent parties would be at hand\r\nto guide the prosecution in complicated proceedings.\r\n\r\nSeveral provisions in the law were aimed at specific abuses which\r\nhad been revealed in the course of prosecutions under the criminal\r\nprovisions of the Act. The original law provided for the posting\r\nof tariffs in public places, in order that shippers might inform\r\nthemselves as to the scheduled rates. But the possibilities of\r\nconcealment of special favors, as well as the mere mechanical\r\ndifficulty of ascertaining the facts in so complicated a maze of\r\ndescriptions and rules with all sorts of exceptions, made it necessary\r\nthat the shipper should rely upon information obtained from the\r\nagent. Nor could the shipper recover for losses incurred through\r\nmisquotation of the rate by this agent inasmuch as the carriers must\r\ncollect according to the tariff, under severe penalties for departure\r\ntherefrom. Even a mistake by the agent in quoting the wrong rate\r\ndid not permit of recovery. The new law met this contingency by the\r\nrequirement that the railroad should quote the rate upon written\r\nrequest; and should be liable to a penalty of $250 for mis-statement\r\nfrom which loss to the shipper should result. The requirement that both\r\nthe request and the reply as to rates should be written, it was hoped,\r\nwould facilitate detection of rebating in the future. Another clause\r\nadded a penalty of $1000 and made it a misdemeanor for any carrier\r\nor its agent to disclose information concerning either the route or\r\ndestination of any shipment, when such information might be used to\r\nthe injury of a competing shipper. Solicitation of such information\r\nwas also penalized. The abuse against which this provision of law was\r\ndirected is well illustrated in the prosecution of the so-called Powder\r\nTrust in 1911. It appeared in one instance that a freight agent had\r\nbeen paid from $15 to $18 a month for furnishing weekly statements\r\nof the shipments, with addresses of consignees, made by a competing\r\nconcern in Chattanooga.[702] Such outrageous espionage, long practised\r\nby the Standard Oil Company, it is to be hoped will be eliminated in\r\nfuture by this provision of law.\r\n\r\nCertain details of the act may be dismissed with mere mention. The\r\nscope of regulation was extended to include telegraph, telephone,\r\nand cable companies. The Commission was specifically authorized to\r\nestablish and enforce reasonable classification of freight. Such\r\nauthority, to be sure, had been continuously exercised for years;\r\nbut this clause put it beyond dispute. A leaf was taken from the\r\nexperience before the Supreme Court in interpretation of the authority\r\nover through routes and joint rates in the \"Portland Gateway\" case,\r\ndescribed in the preceding chapter. Other \"reasonable or satisfactory\r\nroutes\" were more specifically defined; although the complicated\r\nphraseology adopted was of doubtful value. It may well be that the\r\nclause, under judicial interpretation, limited rather than amplified\r\nthe Commission's power as compared with the law of 1906. But the added\r\nrequirement that every carrier must provide reasonable facilities for\r\nthe operation of through routes, proper rules for the interchange of\r\ncars, etc., was bound to promote the efficiency of through business.\r\nThe experience in the \"Orange Routing\" cases, also, brought about a\r\nclear affirmation in the new statute of the right of a shipper to\r\ndesignate the route which he preferred for shipment over connecting\r\nlines. The shipper might also demand a bill of lading conformable to\r\nhis instructions. Whether this freedom of choice to the shipper, with\r\nthe incidental assumption of responsibility for all consequences,\r\nregardless of strikes, blockades, or acts of God, will work to his\r\nadvantage in the long run remains to be seen. He may probably rely\r\nupon strict enforcement of the so-called Carmack amendment of 1906,\r\nwhich makes the initial carrier liable for damage, even if it occurs\r\noff its own line. And, finally, among the minor changes in 1910 was\r\nthe authorization of the Commission to institute inquiries upon its\r\nown initiative. Such power had frequently been exercised; but in\r\nthe enactment of the Hepburn Act four years before, certain verbal\r\ninconsistencies were introduced into Section 15. It was deemed best to\r\nremedy this error by complete authorization to undertake investigations\r\neither with or without complaint.[703]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn place of regulation of the issues of stocks and bonds by Federal\r\nauthority, as pledged in the political platforms, the almost unanimous\r\nopposition in the Senate to such a plan, brought about the substitution\r\nof a Railroad Securities Commission to investigate the subject.\r\nThis, after all, was probably wise; inasmuch as many details as to\r\nconflicting state and Federal powers in such matters, were yet to be\r\ndetermined judicially. Moreover, the plans proposed, as it appeared,\r\nwere so complicated that their adoption might result in the validation\r\nof all capitalization then outstanding without reference to its real\r\nvalue. The question certainly merited further investigation at the\r\nhands of experts.\r\n\r\nUnder the authority above mentioned, the President appointed an able\r\nalthough distinctly conservative commission, headed by President\r\nHadley of Yale University. This body rendered its report in November,\r\n1911.[704] The document was concise, cogent in reasoning (with the\r\nexceptions noted below), wise in its general conclusions and eminently\r\nconciliatory in spirit. It was obviously intended to promote good\r\nrelations between the government and the carriers. The dominant note\r\nwas complete publicity as a corrective for all financial abuses of the\r\ntime. The adequacy of this remedy was probably exaggerated. The wise\r\naccounting provisions of the Acts of 1906-1910[705] were certainly\r\nalready far-reaching in effect. The Securities Commission proposed,\r\nhowever, that they be elaborated to cover fully all phases both of\r\npromotion and of subsequent finance.\r\n\r\nNot less important and wise than the insistence upon financial\r\npublicity, was the recommendation that, until the Supreme Court had\r\nclearly defined the relations between Federal and state authority, the\r\nFederal government should refrain from attempting to regulate the issue\r\nof securities. Too many difficult legal complications remained to be\r\ncleared up.\r\n\r\nThere certainly should have been a more enthusiastic commendation of\r\nthe efforts of states like Massachusetts, Wisconsin, Texas and New\r\nYork to cope with their local problems of financial control.[706] The\r\napparent absence of a due appreciation of the importance of the work\r\nof the various public service commissions all over the country may\r\nperhaps be accounted for on the ground that it lay outside the scope of\r\nthe work of a purely Federal commission. Yet a word of encouragement\r\nto these state administrations would have done something to offset the\r\nrather negative character of its conclusions. Someone must exercise\r\nfinancial control. If inadvisable for the Federal government to\r\nundertake it at this time, as might well be, then it was important to\r\nemphasize the fact that the states must do it as best they could. On\r\nthe other hand, the recommendations concerning physical valuation as\r\nan element in rate regulation were sufficiently progressive to impart\r\nan aspect of judicial balance and general fairness to the report as a\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nTwo specific conclusions of the securities commission, however, were\r\nsurely open to debate. One was the contention that little relation\r\nobtains between capitalization and rates. The statement is, of course,\r\nlargely true; but like most generalizations of the sort fails to state\r\nthe whole truth. It is probably absolutely true as to _particular_\r\nrates. No one would claim for a moment that the heavily capitalized\r\nWabash, operating in trunk line territory alongside the Pennsylvania\r\nsystem, could charge any higher rates because of its financial\r\ndisabilities.\r\n\r\nRather the reverse. But while true of particular rates, capitalization\r\ndoes exert an _indirect_ but nevertheless a very appreciable influence\r\nupon the _general_ level of rates. For this point I have argued\r\nelsewhere at some length.[707] Was it surprising that the pressure for\r\nadvanced rates in 1910-1911 in trunk line territory should come from\r\nthe heavily capitalized New York Central, with substantial aid and\r\ncomfort from the Erie? Was it a mere coincidence that the Lackawanna\r\nroad, with its stock quoted above $500, was a less prominent factor\r\nin the agitation than some of its neighbors? True enough, no direct\r\nrelation between rates and capitalization exists; but that a positive\r\nincentive to higher charges in general may be found in the need of\r\nsupporting a large capitalization seems reasonably clear in the light\r\nof experience. This point was certainly neglected or glossed over in\r\nthe report.\r\n\r\nA most debatable and, as I hold it, dangerous proposition in this\r\nreport was the proposed abolition of the \"dollar mark\" upon capital\r\nstock. However desirable it might be for mining companies and the\r\nlesser industrials, as in Germany, to do away with any stated par\r\nvalue for share capital in order to disabuse the public mind of its\r\npurely artificial character, the proposition is quite different when\r\napplied to an industry like a railroad. There is all the difference\r\nin fact between purely private and competitive conditions of a\r\nmore or less speculative character, and those under which monopoly\r\nprivileges are conferred by gift of the public. Space does not permit\r\na criticism of this proposition in detail. I have elsewhere discussed\r\nit more at length.[708] Many objections occur at once, none of them\r\nmentioned in this report which, almost jauntily, as it seems, proposed\r\nto revolutionize all of our customary habits of financial thought.\r\nAmong these objections there is the fact that abolition of par value\r\nremoves the restraint upon the promoter or management, for liability\r\nto creditors in case of part-paid shares. The experience of the\r\nAsphalt Company of America is illuminating in this regard. May we\r\ntrust mere publicity to provide corresponding safeguards for honest\r\npromotion with this liability removed? Then again, how about the issue\r\nof stock in exchange for property acquired, as had frequently occurred\r\nin the course of railway consolidation? Was it immaterial whether\r\nthe absorbing company put out 500,000 \"participating shares,\" with a\r\nmarket value of $100 each, or twice that number of \"certificates of\r\nparticipation\" commanding half that figure per unit in exchange for the\r\nproperty acquired? And still further, there is the inevitable effect\r\nupon speculation. One of the primary needs of the time was to effect a\r\nseparation of our common carriers from Wall Street influence. Did it\r\nmake no difference whether the Southern Railway \"participating shares\"\r\nwere traded in around $25; or those of the Louisville & Nashville\r\ncommanded a price of $150? Low quotations always offer a great stimulus\r\nto speculative manipulation--as any student of Rock Island affairs\r\nmust concede. To do away with par, which means permission to emit,\r\nwithout reproach, at any figure \"below par\"--how hard it is, indeed,\r\nto get rid of that conception of some standard of normality--could not\r\nbut exert a malign influence. And then, finally, over and above all\r\nother considerations there was the need of some general standard of\r\ncomparison for all sorts of purposes--some base from which to judge of\r\nnormality. The proposal to wipe out all such standards, with the mere\r\nwarning to public and investors alike to beware, seemed like a step\r\nbackward.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the insistence of the commission upon the need of\r\nthe railroads for more capital for development; and the difficulty of\r\nfinancing new enterprises under regulative provisions of law, such as\r\nthe prohibition of the issue of shares at a discount. Massachusetts had\r\nrecently passed through an experience of probably excessive regulation.\r\nBut simple modifications of its anti-stock-watering laws seemed to\r\nhave solved the difficulty. Of course the developmental problems of\r\nthe West and South are quite different from those of New England. Yet\r\nthere was the experience of Texas to fall back upon. Complaint had been\r\nmade, of course, especially by the Gould roads, of the insufficiency of\r\ncapital for new work. But the growth of mileage seemed, nevertheless,\r\nto compare not unfavorably with progress in other states. Were the\r\nGould roads, for example, any better off in other states where greater\r\nliberality of laws prevails? The fact was that much new construction\r\nand improvement remained to be done all over the country, as this\r\nreport duly emphasized; but much of it would probably have to be\r\ndone by companies already in the field. Not many new steam railroad\r\ncompanies are now needed even in the West. It must be confessed that\r\nthe recently authorized extension of the Grand Trunk Railway into the\r\nheart of New England shows how persistent is the demand for new roads\r\neven in the East. But whoever may build, let them learn the lesson, so\r\noften forgotten, that honest management and conservative financing,\r\nto the end that solid credit be first established, has far more to\r\ndo with facilitating development than non-interference by law. This\r\nwas probably a time when encouragement to the railroads in a period\r\nof stress should properly be given. But let it not be forgotten that\r\ngood faith to the public and to stockholders, together with prudent\r\nfinancing, must be the primary source of credit.\r\n\r\nMany admirable features of this report deserve mention, did space\r\npermit. The clear exposition of the distinction between stocks and\r\nbonds, and especially the discussion of inter-corporate financing,\r\noccupied a prominent place. The document promised to play a large part\r\nin the determination of governmental policy in future. It well merited\r\nthe most careful perusal by legislators, financiers and economists. In\r\nthe nature of things so conservative a document could never hope for a\r\npopular reception. But many of its financial platitudes were probably\r\nin need of reiteration for the good, both of the carriers and the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nThe Hepburn Act of 1906, despite the agitation over its enactment in\r\nCongress, \"came in like a lion and went out like a lamb,\" imitating\r\nthereby the month of March in which its crucial changes were effected.\r\nIn the end it proved to be a much less drastic measure than the\r\nrailroads feared. This Mann-Elkins law, four years later, on the other\r\nhand, introduced by the presidential bill as a merely supplementary\r\npiece of legislation,[709] \"rounding out the Roosevelt policies,\"\r\nemerged from Congress really radical in character. Every change\r\nmade was \"progressive\"; and yet there was little public interest\r\nmanifested on either side. No publicity campaign was carried on by\r\nthe carriers. No extended discussion took place in the press. There\r\nwere several reasons for this contrast. It is partly true, as one\r\nwriter has suggested, that \"the marrow had already been extracted\r\nfrom railroad regulation as a political issue; and that it had become\r\nmerely a bone of contention in a factional strife.\" Moreover, the\r\nfundamental principle of effective governmental regulation had been\r\nindisputably affirmed in 1906. The Act of 1910 had for its purpose a\r\nfirmer intrenchment of the position already occupied. Debate centred\r\nlargely upon uninteresting technical questions. The broader issues\r\nwere relegated to second place. Even the carriers on their part were\r\nextremely reserved in stating their position. It was conceded on all\r\nsides that the less public opinion in general was aroused, the lighter\r\nwould be the sentence passed upon the prisoners at bar. It is difficult\r\nto determine in how far the marked advance made in this statute was\r\ndue to contemporary happenings, like the general advances of freight\r\nrates, the Illinois Central scandals and the like; or to a deep-seated\r\nconviction on the part of the progressive element in Congress. But that\r\nthe law, as a whole, was a surprise in the end even to its proponents\r\nis beyond doubt.\r\n\r\nA word may be added concerning the omissions in the Mann-Elkins law.\r\nThe most important was the elimination of the administration plan\r\nfor authorizing agreements between carriers as to rates, subject to\r\nsupervision by the Commission. The Republican platform had definitely\r\npromised relief of this sort to the railroads. The Democratic party\r\nhad somewhat equivocally promised an amendment of the law prohibiting\r\npooling \"to make it unlawful, unless approved by the Commission.\" The\r\nplan, however, met with persistent opposition on all sides, largely\r\non the ground that it conflicted with the Sherman Anti-Trust law.\r\nOther details which fell by the way concerned proposals to extend\r\njurisdiction over water carriers on inland waterways.[710] Whether\r\nthe Commission might exercise any control over those which formed\r\nparties to a through line still remained an open question.[711] And\r\nthen at the last there was the omission of Congress to deal with the\r\nquestion of fixing minimum rates or differentials between rates. This\r\nwas responsible, as will shortly appear, for much of the difficulty\r\nencountered in the application of the long and short haul clause to the\r\ntranscontinental rate problem.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[688] Characterized somewhat heatedly by Senator La Follette in his\r\nAutobiography (_American Magazine_, 1912, p. 189), as \"in all the\r\nhistory of railroad legislation, the rankest, boldest betrayal of\r\npublic interest ever proposed in any legislative body.\"\r\n\r\n[689] The best references are the following:--F.

M. Acworth in the _Railway Age\r\nGazette_, of a conversation with the late Collis P. Huntington\r\nillustrates the possible abuse:\r\n\r\n    \"The Southern Pacific built two fine steamers to run between\r\n    San Francisco and Sacramento, Cal. They gave a daily service,\r\n    each boat running up one day, and down the next, and the\r\n    passenger fare was $2. A private individual thought he saw his\r\n    way to compete with advantage, and bought a smaller boat, which\r\n    only gave a service every other day, but, on the other hand,\r\n    only charged $1 for this service.\r\n\r\n    \"The Southern Pacific began to lose money, and when Mr.\r\n    Huntington next came to California the position was put before\r\n    him. 'Would you like to leave me to run this fight?' said he\r\n    to the local manager. 'Certainly, sir,' was the reply. 'Is\r\n    there an old boat you can buy that could give a service?' Being\r\n    told that there was, Mr. Huntington bought it, ordered the two\r\n    first-class boats to be laid up, and announced that the new\r\n    purchase would run alongside the rival boat at a fare of 50\r\n    cents. 'Why, sir,' said the local manager. '50 cents won't pay\r\n    for the coal.' 'No, I do not suppose it will,' was the answer,\r\n    'but when you go to war you have got to fight!\"\r\n\r\n    \"Before long the owner of the rival boat came to Mr. Huntington\r\n    and asked him what he was prepared to do about it. Mr.\r\n    Huntington replied that he would buy his boat for $10,000--I\r\n    think the sum was. 'But, Mr. Huntington, the boat cost me\r\n    $20,000, and she is worth it.' 'Very likely, but I am only\r\n    going to give you $10,000.' So the fight went on for a while\r\n    longer. When the spring came Mr. Huntington was on the point of\r\n    returning to New York. He sent word to his rival that he was\r\n    leaving California the following week, and that if the matter\r\n    was not settled before he left, his 50-cent boat would continue\r\n    to run till his return the following winter. Whereupon his\r\n    competitor at once threw up the sponge and then sold his boat\r\n    for $10,000. 'Since then,' concluded Mr. Huntington, 'there has\r\n    been no competition with the Southern Pacific on the Sacramento\r\n    river.'\"\r\n\r\n[699] Page 538, _supra_.\r\n\r\n[700] Opinion No. 44, 1911, is the first Commerce Court case to\r\ninterpret this jurisdiction. _Cf._, also, p. 587, _supra_.\r\n\r\n[701] 191 Fed.

The law was passed on June 18, 1910. Within\r\nthe brief period of two years it successfully emerged from a supreme\r\ntest respecting rate advances; enough experience had already been had\r\nwith the new Commerce Court to warrant an opinion as to its merits\r\nas a special tribunal for the review of transportation decisions;\r\nand, finally, an opinion by the Interstate Commerce Commission was\r\nrendered, and is at this writing under review by the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States, in the most important case ever likely to arise\r\nunder the long and short haul clause. Predictions were freely made in\r\n1910 that certain shortcomings in the revised law, particularly the\r\nfailure to grant control over minimum rates and the establishment of\r\ndifferentials between rates, would soon have to be remedied. Experience\r\npromptly threw light upon these questions also. The present is thus\r\nan opportune time to review the entire situation respecting Federal\r\nrailroad regulation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the Commerce Court was created, fears were entertained that there\r\nwould not be enough business to employ its time. This prediction was\r\nfar from being realized, judging by the record of the first year.[712]\r\nIncluding thirty-six cases transferred to it from the various Federal\r\ncircuit courts, a total of fifty-seven suits were placed upon its\r\ndocket up to December 20, 1911. Fifty-four of these cases directly\r\nconcerned orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the large\r\nmajority--forty-four--being suits brought by carriers to set aside such\r\norders. The Commission appealed to the court but once for enforcement\r\nof its mandates, the remaining nine cases being appeals of shippers\r\nfor relief. But a number of these suits were withdrawn or dismissed,\r\nor else lay outside the class of what may fairly be called contested\r\ncases. Only thirty-eight of them were in reality of significance as\r\nthrowing light upon the function of the court as an appellate tribunal,\r\nstanding between the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States. Thirty of these were disposed of up to\r\nDecember 20, 1911. That the court took itself seriously as a check\r\nupon, rather than a coördinate body with the Commission, was evidenced\r\nby the fact that restraining orders or final decrees in favor of the\r\nrailroads and against the shippers and the Commission were issued in\r\nall but three really important cases out of the entire thirty. And even\r\nof these three cases the Commerce Court held two to be outside its\r\njurisdiction, while in the third the carriers had already joined in the\r\nview of the Commission, so that there was really no contest.[713]\r\n\r\nA bitter campaign for the abolition of the Commerce Court, as a\r\nresult of the tendency of its decisions, was waged in Congress during\r\nthe session of 1911-1912. The House of Representatives, in response\r\nto popular feeling, promptly passed a bill abolishing it forthwith,\r\nthe vote standing 120 to 49, with many Republicans joining the\r\nDemocrats in its condemnation. A sharp contest was precipitated in\r\nthe Senate over \"the legislative recall of judges,\" as the matter was\r\nnot inaptly termed. The Administration, through the Attorney-General,\r\nably defended the imperilled court.[714] Evidence was adduced to show\r\nthat the Commission had been sustained in a larger proportion of cases\r\nthan under the old circuit court system;[715] that injunctions had\r\nnot issued with greater freedom than formerly and that none of them\r\nturned upon questions of fact; and, finally, that the Administration\r\nplan had been very much more expeditious. But so far as Congress was\r\nconcerned this evidence seems not to have been convincing. The Senate\r\nsoon followed the House of Representatives, by a vote of thirty-six to\r\ntwenty-three defeating an amendment to the Legislative, Executive and\r\nJudicial Appropriation Bill that made provision for further maintenance\r\nof the court. So strong was the feeling that only by a close vote\r\nwas an amendment prevented which sought to legislate the justices\r\nout of office as well as out of the Commerce Court. For without such\r\nprovision, of course, they would, under the law of 1910, be reassigned\r\nto service in the circuit courts, from which most of them were drawn.\r\nThe final conference agreement between the two houses, appended to the\r\nappropriation bill above mentioned, definitely abolished the court,\r\nbut followed the House plan of reassignment of the justices to duty in\r\nthe circuit courts. This bill was twice vetoed by the President; but\r\nthe second time, it failed of re-passage in the Senate over his veto\r\nby a narrow margin. In the House the popular view was expressed by\r\nre-passing the abolition measure by a vote of 149 to 53. These details\r\nare highly significant as indicating the impatience of Congress with\r\nany attempt at interference with the positive program of administrative\r\ncontrol of railroads decreed in 1906-1910. The fate of the court then\r\nrested in the hands of the President, its original sponsor. A delicate\r\nsituation, concerning the relations between Congress and the executive\r\nin the matter of legislative \"riders\" to appropriation bills, resulted.\r\nWhether such summary proceedings as those initiated by Congress were\r\nwarranted by the facts, depended upon the final disposition of the\r\ncontested cases by the Supreme Court, before which tribunal most of\r\nthem were then pending on appeal. If it appeared that the court had in\r\nreality, as alleged, sought to usurp powers legitimately exercised by\r\nthe Commission, the case for abolition would be greatly strengthened.\r\nBut in any event, the certainty of a presidential veto of any law\r\naffecting this pet project of the Administration rendered the attack\r\nupon the Commerce Court for the time being abortive. As the matter was\r\nfinally left, Congress acceded to the President's wishes, continuing\r\nthe appropriation for maintenance of the court until March 4, 1913.\r\nWhat will happen in the meantime after Congress reassembles, remains to\r\nbe seen.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the proper scope and function of judicial review\r\nwas substantially forwarded by several decisions of the Supreme Court\r\nof the United States in June, 1912. The general effect of these was\r\nsubstantially to curtail the overweening ambition of the Commerce\r\nCourt as an intermediate judicial body. Following the Goodrich Transit\r\nCompany opinion[716] which first reversed the Commerce Court, all\r\nthree of these latest opinions on appeal again favored the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission as against its judicial reviewer. In two instances,\r\nthe assumed jurisdiction of the new court was denied; while in the\r\nthird, although jurisdiction was recognized, its decision was reversed.\r\nBecause of their bearing upon subsequent developments, a brief review\r\nof these cases may not be out of place.\r\n\r\nThe Proctor and Gamble Company, well-known soap manufacturers, had\r\ncomplained of certain regulations concerning demurrage upon their tank\r\ncars. The Commission upheld the carriers, affirming that their rules\r\nwere proper and lawful. The complainants thereupon appealed to the\r\nCommerce Court, which claimed jurisdiction to award pecuniary relief,\r\nalthough in this instance it declined so to do, on the ground that the\r\nCommission had rightfully decided the matter in the first instance.\r\nAppeal then followed to the Supreme Court, with the odd circumstance\r\nthat the Commission and the railways joined issue against the\r\nshippers. The question was largely a legal one, involving definition\r\nof the jurisdiction of the new tribunal. The Supreme Court in this\r\ninstance,[717]--and, it may be added, in the Cincinnati Freight Bureau\r\ncase,[718] which similarly involved the relative powers of the court\r\nand the Commission,--unanimously affirmed the right of the Commission\r\nto decide such matters of fact finally.\r\n\r\n    To recognize the existence in the court below [the Commerce\r\n    Court] of the power which it deemed it possessed, would result\r\n    in frustrating the legislative public policy which led to\r\n    the adoption of the act. The act creating the Commerce Court\r\n    was intended to be but a part of the existing system for the\r\n    regulation of interstate commerce.... It was not intended to\r\n    destroy the existing machinery or method of regulation, but to\r\n    cause it to be more efficient.... Wholly irrespective of the\r\n    general considerations stated, we think the conclusion of the\r\n    [Commerce] Court, as to its possession of jurisdiction over the\r\n    subject referred to, was clearly repugnant in other respects to\r\n    the express terms of the act.\r\n\r\nSuch a pronouncement, following the line of decisions headed by\r\nthe Illinois Central Car Distribution case,[719] must make for\r\nconcentration of responsibility and more effective regulation in the\r\nyears to come.\r\n\r\nThe third decision of the Supreme Court, above referred to, was known\r\nas the \"Restrictive Rate case.\"[720] Might railway companies--the\r\nBaltimore & Ohio and others--charge a different rate for the carriage\r\nof coal to railways than to other shippers, the coal being intended\r\nfor the use of the railways as fuel? In this instance the Commission\r\nforbade the practice. Its order was then promptly enjoined by the\r\nCommerce Court. Jurisdiction of the Commerce Court was conceded by the\r\nSupreme Court in this instance also, but its opinion was again flatly\r\nreversed. The issue at bottom was really one of value of service as\r\nagainst cost of service in the determination of reasonable rates.\r\nObviously the cost of carrying railway-fuel coal between two given\r\npoints is practically the same as that of carrying commercial coal.\r\nThe Commission, supported now by the Supreme Court in frowning upon\r\nany difference in the charge, was thus according priority to this\r\nconsideration of cost. The view of the Commerce Court, which was here\r\nreversed, tended, on the other hand, to emphasize such facts as that\r\nthe two sorts of coal were intended for different purposes and did\r\nnot come in competition with one another as to price. In other words,\r\nvalue of service--what the traffic would bear--was given greater weight\r\nthan mere considerations of cost. The Supreme Court declined to accept\r\nthis view, preferring to regard transportation as a matter of physical\r\ncarriage of goods, rather than to look beyond this essential service\r\n\"to the greater or less inducement to seek the service\"--that is to\r\nsay, to regard its commercial aspects.\r\n\r\nThe last of this batch of Supreme Court decisions was mainly a\r\nquestion at law, namely the right of the Commerce Court to enjoin\r\nthe enforcement of an order of the Commission concerning certain\r\nallowances for lighterage and terminal service on sugar in New\r\nYork harbor.[721] The judicial poise of the Supreme Court was here\r\nevidenced in its affirmation of the right of the Commerce Court to\r\nissue the injunction. The plain purpose of the law in setting up this\r\nintermediate tribunal as a safeguard against abuse of administrative\r\nauthority was given effect; but it was ordered, nevertheless, that the\r\ncase be remanded, to be disposed of on its merits before the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission, the forum selected by Congress for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe grist of cases appealed to the Commerce Court may profitably be\r\ndivided for discussion into two groups, namely, those which clearly\r\nconcerned questions of law and those in which matters of fact, or\r\neconomic conclusions based thereon, were primarily at stake. The first\r\ngroup of purely law cases need detain us but briefly. There could be\r\nlittle doubt about the necessity of judicial review of law findings\r\nof the Commission. The best illustration is afforded by the first\r\ndecision of the Commerce Court to be reviewed by the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States.[722] Inland water carriers were not placed under\r\nthe jurisdiction of the Act to Regulate Commerce by the Mann-Elkins\r\namendments of 1910, except in so far as they were joined in control\r\nwith railroads or might enter into arrangements for continuous\r\nshipments with carriers by land. But the Commission, having always\r\nrequired railroads to file accounts covering both their local and\r\ninterstate business, called upon the carriers on the Great Lakes to\r\nrender similar statements as to their entire traffic, whether subject\r\nto Federal control or not. This the water lines refused to do. The\r\nCommerce Court, in overruling the Commission, did not question the\r\npower of Congress to require such accounts, but held that it was its\r\nintention to confine publicity to that portion of the lake traffic\r\nover which the jurisdiction of the Commission actually extended. It\r\nthus appears that the law point was doubly important; inasmuch as\r\nits determination affected not alone the enforcement of publicity\r\nfor water lines but also of all carriers by land, so far as their\r\nintrastate business was concerned. Fortunately the Supreme Court, in\r\nsustaining the Commission, held that the Commerce Court had erred in\r\nconfusing \"knowledge\" of intrastate business with its \"regulation.\"\r\nAs to the former, the authority of the Commission was fully upheld.\r\nThis and the important question upon which the entire Intermountain\r\nrate controversy rested, namely, as to the authority of the Commission\r\nto prescribe relativity of rates,[723] were the most important points\r\nof law at first raised before the new tribunal. Other legal questions\r\ndecided by the Commerce Court--generally in favor of the railroads,\r\nbe it observed--were: whether reparation might be claimed for an\r\nunreasonable rate when the burden had been already passed on to the\r\nconsumer;[724] whether the Nashville Grain Exchange might lawfully\r\nintervene in proceedings before the Commission under the liberal terms\r\nof the law of 1910;[725] whether \"separately established rates\" applied\r\nby a carrier to through traffic when there is a through rate but no\r\njoint rate are matters of interstate commerce or not;[726] as to the\r\nlimitations by law of the right of carriers to refund overcharges to\r\nshippers;[727] and whether the Union Stockyards Company was a common\r\ncarrier engaged in interstate commerce, and thus subject to control\r\nas to preferential treatment of shippers.[728] However these cases\r\nmight be finally decided by the court of last resort, there could be\r\nno conflict of powers between the Commerce Court and the Commission in\r\nregard to such matters of law. The real bone of contention between the\r\ntwo bodies--administrative and judicial, respectively--was the question\r\nof their respective powers outside the field of law.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the disputes over law points, we may profitably\r\nconsider one further case, important because of its bearing upon the\r\ndetermination of reasonable rates. This occurred in 1911 through a\r\nrevival of the old Maximum (Cincinnati) Freight Rate case of 1896.[729]\r\nIt will be recalled that this involved the relative rates to southern\r\ncentres from eastern and middle western cities.[730] In the original\r\ncase in 1894, the Commission held that the rates from Cincinnati were\r\ntoo high by comparison with the rates from New York; ordering those\r\nfor first-class freight, for example, to be reduced from seventy-six\r\ncents to sixty cents per hundred pounds. The Supreme Court directed a\r\ndismissal of the bill of complaint, on the ground that the Commission\r\nhad no authority to establish rates for the future. This defect in the\r\nlaw being remedied by the amendment of 1906, the Commission, upon a new\r\ncomplaint, made a second order in 1910. This differed from its earlier\r\ndecision in prescribing a reduction of the rate from Cincinnati from\r\nseventy-six cents to only seventy cents, whereas the first decision had\r\nordered it reduced to sixty cents per hundred pounds. The Cincinnati\r\nshippers, not content with this reduction, then promptly appealed to\r\nthe Commerce Court for a review of the case. The proceeding was unique,\r\ntherefore, in that the appeal to the Commerce Court was taken, not by\r\nthe carriers but by shippers who complained that the rates _established\r\nby the Commission were too high_. The Commerce Court in sustaining\r\nthe order of the Commission, therefore, in reality acted in favor of\r\nthe railroads, being thereby consistent with its general attitude of\r\nconservatism. But its right to take cognizance of such questions was\r\ndenied by the Supreme Court. Thus, in all probability, this famous and\r\nprotracted litigation was brought to a close.\r\n\r\nThe specific law point in this Cincinnati case was as to whether the\r\nreasonableness of a rate should be determined in the light solely of\r\nits effect upon the particular carrier concerned; or whether the\r\nresult for other competing lines and for the entire territory served,\r\nshould also be taken into consideration. The Cincinnati Southern\r\nRailroad extended as a short and direct route 336 miles due south to\r\nChattanooga. It was neither expensive to construct, to maintain or to\r\noperate. It was the first in the field; having been constructed by the\r\ncity of Cincinnati to reach the southern markets. It was not burdened\r\nby unremunerative branch lines. Its net earnings amounted to over forty\r\nper cent. upon the capital stock. Other competing railroads between the\r\nsame points were one-third longer and were otherwise burdened by the\r\nnecessity of maintaining unprofitable branches. These other roads could\r\nnot be so economically operated. But they had voluntarily entered the\r\nfield in competition _after_ this direct line was constructed, and they\r\nhad elected to continue therein. The rates established, however, for\r\nthe Cincinnati Southern,--the short line,--naturally fixed the rates\r\nat which these others had to participate in the traffic. At the rate\r\nof seventy cents, prescribed in this second order of the Commission,\r\nall the carriers concerned could make a living. The short line alone,\r\npresumably, could have endured the rate of sixty cents as prescribed at\r\nfirst. Was it lawful, however, to decide a complaint preferred against\r\na particular most-favored railroad by a city which built it to attain\r\na certain object, upon the basis of the effect of such rates, not upon\r\nthis road but upon others subsequently built and less fortunately\r\nsituated? To do so would, of course, enable the most-favored carrier to\r\nprosper exceedingly; even more so than it did then. But these higher\r\nrates would, most unfortunately, thwart the very purpose animating its\r\nconstruction. The Commission, sustained by the majority of the Commerce\r\nCourt, adopted the latter view.[731] A dissenting minority, on the\r\nother hand, presented strongly the opinion that under such special\r\ncircumstances, in the determination as to reasonableness, no right\r\nexisted for considering the effect of a rate upon other roads than\r\nthe particular one against which the complaint lay. The Supreme Court\r\nin affirming the sole authority of the Commission to pass upon such\r\nissues, nevertheless, left this detail concerning the determination of\r\nreasonableness of rates for possible reargument in future.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAttention may be now directed to the controversy as to the seat of\r\nauthority, not over law points, but concerning distinctly economic\r\nissues. A typical case before the Commerce Court concerned rates from\r\nNew Orleans to several competing cities on the line of the Louisville &\r\nNashville Railroad.[732] An interesting phase of local discrimination\r\nappeared. The accompanying map discloses the situation. Normally the\r\nthrough rate from New Orleans to Montgomery (the long-distance point)\r\nwould be less than the sum of the local rates from New Orleans to\r\nMobile (the intermediate point) and then from Mobile on to Montgomery.\r\nThis would conform to the general rule, which is based on the simple\r\nfact that through rates, being competitive, are usually forced below\r\nthe level of local charges, commonly unaffected by such competition.\r\nIn this case the situation was reversed. Water competition affected\r\nthe local rates, both into Mobile from New Orleans by sea on the one\r\nside, and then up the Alabama to Montgomery by river steamer on the\r\nother. But such water competition did not apply to the through rate,\r\nprobably because through shipment by water would necessitate a transfer\r\n_en route_ from a gulf steamer to a river boat at Mobile. Thus in this\r\ncase it came about that local competition was keener than the rivalry\r\nas to through traffic. The Louisville & Nashville, nevertheless, had\r\nsecured the bulk of the business to Mobile by reason of the low local\r\nrates by rail which had been in effect for many years, even after\r\npractical elimination of the water lines. The situation was certainly\r\nanomalous, from the viewpoint of cost of service by rail alone; in that\r\nthe freight rate was higher on goods sent to Montgomery direct than\r\nwhen shipped on a combination of local rates on Mobile. This situation,\r\nit is apparent, enabled Mobile jobbers to buy goods in New Orleans and\r\nactually lay them down in Montgomery for less than the freight charges\r\nto the Montgomery dealers who were on the spot. The same situation\r\nprevailed at Pensacola.\r\n\r\nThe immediate cause of dispute was the promulgation by the Commission\r\nin 1907, under the new powers conferred by the Hepburn Act, of a rule\r\nthat through rates must not exceed the combination of locals between\r\nthe same points. To comply with this rule, the Louisville & Nashville,\r\nin this instance, faced the alternative either of reducing the through\r\nrate from New Orleans to Montgomery to the sum of its local charges or\r\nelse of raising one or both of the latter. The railroad naturally chose\r\nthe latter course--now enabled to do so with safety as the boat lines\r\nhad long since been put out of business. It advanced its local rates\r\nfrom New Orleans to Mobile sufficiently to make the new combination of\r\nlocal charges equal the through rate to Montgomery. The Commission, on\r\ncomplaint of Montgomery, suspended this advance,--seeking to compel\r\nthe railroad to even things up, not by advance of the local charges\r\nbut by a reduction of the through rate. This, it is obvious, would\r\nrelieve Montgomery of the discrimination as against Mobile of which it\r\ncomplained. As to none of the facts above outlined, was there dispute\r\nbetween the court and the Commission. The controversy turned solely\r\nupon which of the two remedies should be chosen to meet the situation.\r\nWere the through rates unreasonably high? This was the Commission's\r\ncontention. If so, equalization should be attained by their reduction.\r\nOr, on the other hand, were the local rates unreasonably low? If so,\r\nthey might be evened upward with propriety. This was the contention\r\nof the Commerce Court, leading it to set aside the order of the\r\nCommission. Which was the body competent to pass upon such an issue?\r\nThe Supreme Court had to be called upon to decide. And in the meantime\r\nthere was the same old story of delay, while irreparable loss to\r\nshippers went on.\r\n\r\nIn another instance,--the California lemon case,--[733] the issue\r\nwas even more sharply drawn between the Commission and the Commerce\r\nCourt. The latter, it was averred, not even content to draw its own\r\nconclusions in matters of fact, had made an \"attempt to look into the\r\nmind of the Commission for the purpose of ascertaining the reasons\r\non which its order was based.\" The case dated from 1909, when the\r\nblanket rate from the entire territory east of the Rocky mountains was\r\nadvanced by the railroads from $1.00 to $1.15. This action followed the\r\nimposition of a high protective duty on lemons in the Payne-Aldrich\r\ntariff. After careful investigation the Commission, reviewing the whole\r\nmatter of rates upon citrus fruits, ordered the lemon rate to be\r\nreduced once more to $1.00. Appeal was promptly taken to the Commerce\r\nCourt, which set aside the order as beyond the scope of authority\r\ndelegated by Congress. The court held that the Commission had sought\r\nso to adjust rates as to afford protection to the California lemon\r\nindustry against foreign competition, especially from the growers\r\nin Sicily; in place of confining its attention to the \"intrinsic\r\nreasonableness\" of the transportation charge. The gage thus thrown\r\ndown was promptly taken up by the Commission in a second opinion,\r\nrendered within two months of the injunction granted by the Commerce\r\nCourt. This time it exhaustively considered all phases of the cost and\r\nmanner of transportation for oranges and lemons and re-affirmed its\r\nopinion that the rate of one dollar per hundred pounds was reasonable.\r\nAt this writing the matter rests there. What the Commerce Court will\r\ndo, remains to be seen. The case, as re-stated by the Commission, is\r\nmasterly in its discussion of the responsibilities laid upon it by the\r\nlaw. \"Is the country to be treated as a whole for commercial purposes,\r\nor shall it be infinitely divided?\"\r\n\r\nThe Intermountain Rate cases, discussed in the next chapter as a phase\r\nof the long and short haul question, illustrate even more clearly these\r\nconflicts between the court and the Commission on matters of economics.\r\nBut they introduced no new legal technicalities. They merely emphasized\r\nthe critical nature of the controversy, so far as it concerned the\r\nlarger constitutional question of separation of powers between the\r\nthree main branches of our government.\r\n\r\nThe situation, as revealed by these typical cases, reduced itself, in\r\nbrief, to this: it was the same old question of broad _versus_ narrow\r\ncourt review all over again. The Commerce Court held it to be its\r\nproper function, as a court of law, to review in the broadest way all\r\ncases which came before it on appeal. The Commission, on the other\r\nhand, maintained that not only all matters of fact, but all inferences\r\nas to economic facts, of necessity lay solely within the range of\r\nits own authority, And it was certainly true that, without some such\r\nlimitation upon the right of review, the Commission might about as\r\nwell have retired from the field of regulation entirely, and contented\r\nitself with enforcing the safety appliance laws, collecting statistics\r\nand serving as a general publicity office.[734] Fortunately the\r\nsituation promised to be saved by the line of Supreme Court decisions\r\nflowing from the Illinois Central case.[735] The making of a rate for\r\nthe future being a legislative and not a judicial function, the power\r\nto determine that a particular rate was or was not reasonable for the\r\nfuture, or that a particular discrimination was or was not undue, was\r\na discretionary legislative power which could not be reviewed by the\r\njudiciary. If the Supreme Court in due time applied this reasoning to\r\nthese later cases, the Commerce Court might confidently be expected to\r\ntake its proper place in the Federal scheme of things. Until it was\r\nforced to do so, much of the railroad legislation of recent years would\r\nfail to ensure that full measure of certainty and promptitude of relief\r\nto which the country was entitled, and which it was bound to have.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1910 in the\r\nmatter of freight rate advances[736] was of prime importance; not alone\r\nbecause of the great monetary and commercial interests involved, but\r\nalso because it might afford a forecast of the policy of the government\r\nin such matters in future. Public interest was quickened also because\r\nof the novelty of resting the burden of proof upon the railroads rather\r\nthan upon the shippers, as in the past. The effect of this change in\r\nprocedure was apparent throughout. The representatives of the shippers\r\nwere, in most cases, content to point out the inadequacy of the reasons\r\nadvanced by the carriers. The railroads, on the other hand, were forced\r\nto come forward aggressively with positive arguments favoring their\r\nside of the case. The only exception to the negative task of appearing\r\nin rebuttal against the carriers' arguments was in the somewhat\r\nspectacular presentation of the novel issue of \"scientific management,\"\r\nshortly to be discussed.\r\n\r\nThe movement of freight rates since 1900 was insistently upward. On\r\ntwo separate occasions prior to 1910, as we have seen,[737] general\r\nadvances by concerted action of the carriers took place, namely in 1903\r\nand 1907. These earlier changes had been mainly confined to commodity\r\nrates. All the great staples, such as iron and steel, grain, coal and\r\ncoke, glass, brick and cement, were affected. The rate increases of\r\n1910, on the other hand, which gave rise to the first important test\r\nof the Mann-Elkins law, were mainly confined to advances in class\r\nrates,--that is to say, the rates upon merchandise and the better\r\ngrades of freight. It was doubtless true, as alleged, that the steady\r\ndecline throughout a generation before 1900 had unduly depressed\r\nthe scale of charges for transportation service; and that prices in\r\ngeneral, and especially wages and costs of operation, had greatly\r\nenhanced since that time. To meet this situation, the carriers had\r\nproceeded either to get together by an understanding not to compete;\r\nor else they had permanently put an end to competition by downright\r\nconsolidation. After the first upward movement which paused about\r\n1904, some time elapsed without further efforts in this direction.\r\nThen, after postponement of a concerted attempt in 1908 matters went\r\non quietly enough until 1910. Many changes were unostentatiously\r\nmade in individual instances by modification of traffic rules or\r\nclassification;[738] but no widespread action took place. The occasion\r\nfor the renewal of the upward movement in 1910 was an insistent demand\r\nof railroad employees all over the country for a rise in wages. And the\r\nacquiescent attitude of the railroad managers toward their employees,\r\nsuggested a tacit understanding that wages were to be raised on\r\ncondition that the brotherhoods support the movement to recover this\r\nadvance from the public through an increase in freight rates.\r\n\r\nThe trunk lines filed their new tariffs in 1910, even while Congress\r\nwas in the throes of debate over the Mann-Elkins Act. These schedules\r\nsubstantially increased all class rates,--by from eight to twenty\r\nper cent;--and affected about half the commodity rates, mainly of\r\nthe lesser sort. The western railroads promptly followed suit,\r\nfiling higher tariffs by about ten per cent, for approximately 200\r\ncommodities. In response to vehement protest from all over the country,\r\nCongress, as we have seen,[739] promptly conferred authority upon\r\nthe Interstate Commerce Commission by the Mann-Elkins amendments to\r\nsuspend such rate advances temporarily for examination as to their\r\nreasonableness. By virtue of this authority the Commission took\r\ntestimony for several months and rendered its decisions both for\r\nthe eastern and western railroads on February 22, 1911.[740] The\r\nstrongest impression which one gains from examination of the testimony,\r\nis that the case for the railroads was imperfectly organized and\r\ninadequately presented. There was no division of the field in argument,\r\nwith intensive cultivation in each case; but all of the railway\r\nrepresentatives traversed much of the same ground, so widely scattering\r\ntheir effort that but superficial treatment of each point was possible.\r\nThe shippers, on the other hand, evidently laid out their plan of\r\ncampaign with more system and had correspondingly better results.\r\n\r\nThe railroads in the presentation of their case were somewhat\r\nembarrassed by several complications, some applicable to all the\r\nroads alike, while others arose from the diversity of financial and\r\noperating conditions on different lines. All alike were denied resort\r\nto the main argument advanced in favor of the general rate advances in\r\nearlier years, particularly in 1900. It had been expected that stress\r\nmight be laid upon the increased cost of materials used in construction\r\nor operation; but the fact that, largely as an aftermath of industrial\r\ndepression, prices of many commodities were actually lower in 1910\r\nthan they had been on the average for a decade, deprived the railroads\r\nof this powerful argument. The main exceptions in this respect were\r\nin the prices of fuel and lumber. Owing to the diversity of operating\r\nconditions among the carriers, difficulty was also experienced in\r\nadducing the wage increases of 1910 as a warrant for advancing freight\r\nrates. Considering the entire railroad net affected, it appeared\r\nthat the augmentation in revenue from the proposed advances would be\r\n$27,000,000; whereas the already conceded wage increases were in excess\r\nof $34,000,000,--in each case calculations being based upon the same\r\nvolume of traffic and employment as in the preceding year. The wage\r\nargument, generally applied, was thus valid. But taking the carriers\r\none by one, it appeared that the changes in wages and revenue which\r\nmight result, varied greatly. On the New York Central, the increase in\r\nrevenue would just about cover the rise in wages; on the Pennsylvania,\r\nit was less than half of the enlarged payroll. It was thus apparent\r\nthat emphasis upon the increase in wages would not be equally valid for\r\nargument by all roads alike. The possible advantage of a united front\r\nwas thereby denied.\r\n\r\nBroader ground for rate increases was taken by the carriers, in the\r\nargument that operating expenses had greatly augmented in recent\r\nyears, not so much because of higher prices or even wages, but\r\nbecause of the exactions of the public in the way either of better\r\nfacilities and service or of greater safety. It was alleged that vast\r\nexpenditures had been necessarily made for such purposes without a\r\ncommensurate increase in revenue.[741] The main proof of this point lay\r\nin statistical presentation of the greatly increased operating ratio\r\nwithin recent years; that is to say, the higher percentage of gross\r\nrevenue which it was necessary to expend in operation. Here again, the\r\ncarriers failed to agree in the particular margin of safety above a\r\nreasonable return upon the investment, paid in dividends, which should\r\nbe put back into the property. It was also urged by the carriers that\r\nthe necessary funds for constructive development in future could be\r\nobtained only by such improvement in railroad credit as would result\r\nfrom a substantial margin of net earnings above reasonable dividends.\r\nSuch were, in the main, the arguments presented by the railroads on\r\nbehalf of their plea that the proposed rate advances should not be\r\nsuspended.\r\n\r\nThe case in rebuttal, as presented by representatives of commercial\r\norganizations, was carried aggressively into the enemy's territory\r\nin only one line of argument. It was alleged that sufficient economy\r\nin operation could be effected by means of \"scientific management\"\r\nto more than offset the increase in wages together with the general\r\ndemand for better service and improvements by the public.[742] On\r\nthe whole the arraignment of the carriers in this regard failed to\r\nestablish its point. Whatever results from \"efficiency\" had been\r\nobtained in manufacturing establishments, the limited experience in\r\nrailroading outside of shop management, while generally satisfactory,\r\nhad not been altogether convincing. Essential differences between\r\nrailroads and factories, particularly in respect of minute supervision\r\nof labor scattered over hundreds of miles of line, tended to render\r\nimpracticable many of the improvements in process advocated by\r\nefficiency engineers. The demands incident to the operation of\r\npublic-service companies are also different from those applicable in\r\nprivate business. Railroads must consider not only profit-making,\r\nbut adequate and satisfactory service. And, finally, the thorough\r\norganization of labor among carriers was a bar to the untrammelled\r\nintroduction of new methods. Nevertheless, the publicity which was\r\nderived from the presentation of this case before the Commission could\r\nnot fail to draw attention to the need of determined and general\r\napplication of such sound and businesslike methods as were found\r\npracticable.\r\n\r\nThe shippers attempted, in general, to meet the railway arguments\r\npoint by point. Thus the plea of steadily increasing operating ratios\r\nabsorbing an ever larger proportion of gross earnings, was met by\r\nstatistical evidence showing that gross revenues had so rapidly\r\naugmented during the decade as, nevertheless, to permit of a steady\r\nincrease in net revenue year by year. In this regard, the time was\r\ncertainly opportune for establishing this point. Recovery from the\r\ndepression following 1907 was actively under way during 1909-1910.\r\nNot even the indications that a less rosy future was to ensue in\r\n1911,--judged by the then course of net earnings,--sufficed to offset\r\nstatistical evidence in this regard. Even if for all the roads taken\r\ntogether the wage increases would more than absorb the increasing\r\nrevenues, the fiscal year 1910 had produced so large an increase in net\r\nearnings,--$55,000,000,--as to still leave the carriers better off than\r\nthey were before, even without the increased freight rates for which\r\nthey were asking.[743]\r\n\r\nThe decisions of the Commission in both cases, covering advances east\r\nand west, was unanimously against the railroads.[744] It was held that\r\nthe carriers had failed to prove their case at practically every point.\r\nWhile it was true that cost of operation had increased for various\r\nreasons, it was also plain that the growth of the business had more\r\nthan absorbed these additional outlays. And as to the contention that\r\na fair return upon the value of the property was not being earned, the\r\nentire field of argument concerning the reasonableness of railroad\r\nrates as related to investment, was necessarily held in abeyance\r\npending more positive data than was then at hand. The decisions,\r\nhowever, contained a ray of hope for the carriers in the promise that\r\nwhile this general increase would not be upheld, particular changes\r\nin future would be considered on their merits in each case.[745] The\r\nrailroads accepted the decision as final, and withdrew the proposed\r\ntariffs with surprisingly little protest.[741] Whether the great\r\nincrease in prices in 1912 over preceding years, operating indirectly\r\nthrough insistent pressure for wage increases to enhance costs of\r\noperation, will necessitate a reopening of this issue in a large way,\r\nseems likely to depend upon the rate at which the volume of traffic\r\naugments in the immediate future. It is clear, in any event, that\r\na sufficient surplus earning power must be permitted to insure a\r\ncontinuance in favor of railway securities as compared with other forms\r\nof investment.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[712] Interstate Commerce Commission, Annual Report 1911, pp. 53, 57,\r\n59 and 206.\r\n\r\n[713] Since this time a number of decisions have been rendered, on\r\nthe whole more favorably to the Commission.

It was uncertain at\r\nthe time how extensive was the violation of the distance principle;\r\nalthough a comprehensive investigation by the Elkins Committee in\r\n1905[747] showed the existence of many irregular tariffs all over the\r\ncountry. Within the first ten months after the law took effect, 5723\r\napplications for relief under this section were filed. Of this number\r\nonly two hundred and ninety concerned passenger fares: making it\r\nclear that the problem was mainly one of adjustment of freight rates.\r\nInasmuch as the Commission held that each application should be treated\r\nas a formal complaint to be separately passed upon, it will be seen\r\nthat these applications for relief considerably outnumbered the total\r\nof 4570 formal complaints which had otherwise been filed since 1887.\r\nAmendment of the fourth section obviously imposed a heavy additional\r\nburden upon this administrative arm of the Federal government.\r\n\r\nThe proposition to amend the long and short haul clause in 1910 called\r\nforth the same divergence of opinion in Congress as to regulation\r\nwhich characterized the original debate twenty years before. One\r\nparty wanted an absolute long and short haul clause, permitting of\r\nno departure from the distance principle. The other stood for a more\r\nelastic plan, whereby carriers under certain economic justification\r\nshould be allowed to make a higher charge at the intermediate point.\r\nThe prime difficulty lay in defining these exceptional cases. Had\r\nCongress left this solely to the discretion of the Commission without\r\nsuch definition, the law might be held unconstitutional, as involving\r\na complete delegation of legislative power. The situation was clearly\r\nstated at the time by the Chairman of the House Committee on Interstate\r\nCommerce. \"Practically what we do here is to give the Commission power\r\nto say what, in a particular case, shall be a just and reasonable rate;\r\nalthough we declare as a general proposition that it shall be unjust\r\nand unreasonable to charge more for a short haul than for a long haul.\"\r\nIn brief, it is clear that Congress intended that the general language\r\nof the statute should furnish the rule which the Commission was to\r\nadopt in applying this section of the law.\r\n\r\nWas there any further intention of Congress in thus amending the long\r\nand short haul clause? The carriers contended that the only effect was\r\nto deny the railways the right to decide for themselves whether they\r\nmight disregard the rule of the section: in other words, that they\r\nmust conform to the interpretation laid down by the Commission itself\r\nin the Georgia Railroad Commission cases in 1892.[748] The Commission,\r\non the other hand, at once interpreted the amendment, as defining the\r\npurpose of Congress differently. It held that the railroads must assume\r\nthe burden of justification. The carriers, therefore, must become the\r\nadvancing party in proving that violation of the distance principle was\r\nwarranted by the necessities of the case. It is obvious that, without\r\nthis interpretation placed upon the amendment, Congress would not be\r\nproviding a remedy for local discrimination, but would be merely giving\r\npower to declare the existence of a wrong.\r\n\r\nThe constitutionality of the amended section seemed likely to depend\r\nupon the manner in which it was applied administratively. If construed\r\nas conferring unrestricted power to grant or deny applications for\r\nrelief, it would probably be held void, as already observed, as an\r\nunfettered delegation of legislative authority. Rate making being\r\na legislative function, this attribute of the Congress could not\r\nconstitutionally be vested in entirety in an administrative body.\r\nThe Commission must, in other words, be restricted and guided by\r\ncertain rules and standards set by the legislature. This point had\r\nbeen well established respecting the exercise of control over the\r\nissue of capital stock by railroads by the state commissions. It was\r\nclear, also, that the long and short haul clause did not impose an\r\ninviolable rule to be enforced against all carriers. This had been the\r\ncontention of complainants against the railroads in the Spokane case,\r\nsoon to be considered. It seemed clear that the proper function of\r\nthe Commission under the law, was to investigate each case by itself\r\nin the light of the first three sections of the Act in general. After\r\nsuch investigation, if it appeared that a departure from the distance\r\nprinciple would result neither in unreasonable rates nor in undue\r\ndiscrimination, permission therefore must be granted. Under such\r\ncircumstances it could not lawfully be withheld. And in the contrary\r\ncase deviation from the long and short haul principle must likewise be\r\nrefused.\r\n\r\nThe Commission in enforcing the new long and short haul clause, in the\r\nfirst place laid down certain general rules for its own guidance.[749]\r\nPerhaps the most important of these was that the different rates or\r\nfares to be compared, must apply to the same classes of transportation.\r\nIt would be obviously unjust to compare a one-way fare with either\r\nexcursion or commutation rates. Export and import freight rates,\r\nusually lower than regular domestic rates, must each be dealt with in\r\na class by themselves, in determining whether the more distant point\r\nby having a higher rate prejudiced the rights of intermediate ones.\r\nCongress certainly did not intend to make the charging of a commodity\r\nor carload rate in transcontinental traffic unlawful, merely because it\r\nhappened to be lower than local rates or less-than-carload classified\r\nshipments from intermediate points. Violation of the distance principle\r\nmust properly always be determined by comparison between rates of the\r\nsame kind. A number of similar rules were promulgated for the sake of\r\nduly standardizing practice.\r\n\r\nApplications from the carriers for exemption from the long and short\r\nhaul clause in freight tariffs fell into four distinct groups. The\r\nlargest number of petitions,--more than one-fourth of the total\r\nfiled,--had to do with the necessities of circuitous lines in meeting\r\nthrough rates made over more direct routes.[750] In such cases the\r\nlowest through rate was often made by the longer line, which might,\r\nat the same time, conceivably be operated at a lower cost. Permanent\r\nrelief was granted by the Commission in comparatively few of such\r\ninstances; and then only when it appeared either that the short line\r\nhad observed the distance principle throughout, or else that the\r\nintermediate rates upon the long line were apparently reasonable and\r\njust, in and of themselves. Under such conditions the Commission\r\nsometimes permitted the circuitous route, especially if it were\r\nmanifestly so, to meet, not only the prevailing rate over the short\r\nline, but also any future rate which it might put into effect.\r\n\r\nNext in importance, measured by the number of applications for relief\r\nfrom the long and short haul clause in freight tariffs, were those\r\nbased upon the exigencies of market competition. The familiar case of\r\nthe rivalry of Florida and California orange growers in the eastern\r\nmarkets may illustrate the situation.[751] The growers must be put\r\ninto that market and held there in each case in competition with one\r\nanother, each served by the carriers who profited by their traffic.\r\nShould it be said that because such market competition compelled a\r\nlow through rate, irrespective of distance, that no higher rate at\r\nany intermediate point where such market competition did not exist,\r\nshould be allowed? The difficulty and danger, however, of accepting\r\nthe justification of market competition was, of course, the fact that\r\nexemption from the distance principle might deny to the intermediate\r\npoints the advantage to which they were justly entitled by reason\r\nof their geographical location.[752] The compelling force of market\r\ncompetition is exemplified also in the transportation of pine lumber\r\nfrom all along the southern tier of states to the consuming territory\r\nof the treeless Middle West. The mills in Mississippi, Louisiana,\r\nArkansas, and Texas are so much nearer than those in Florida or\r\nGeorgia, that exceptionally low rates per mile must be put in\r\nfrom these latter states to enable them to hold their own. Such\r\nexceptionally low rates, if applied to all intermediate points, would,\r\nof course, prove ruinously unprofitable to the railroads concerned.\r\nThere were certainly contingencies of this sort entitled to relief.\r\n\r\nClosely akin to market competition in compelling departure from the\r\nlong and short haul clause, were the practices arising in connection\r\nwith commodity rates to meet special circumstances in production or\r\nconsumption. A public building, perhaps, was to be erected at a given\r\npoint; and active competition arose from quarrymen in different parts\r\nof the country for supplying the cut stone. A carrier serving such a\r\nquarry put in a special carload rate in order to enable the shipper\r\non its line to compete for the contract. No similar commodity rates,\r\nas a fact, were called for from intermediate stations, inasmuch as no\r\nother quarries on the line were interested in this particular job.\r\nThe Commission ruled in such cases that no tariffs from intermediate\r\npoints need be filed, unless desired for the benefit of some other\r\nshipper. Such cases are obviously analogous in principle to those above\r\nmentioned under the heading of market competition.\r\n\r\nThe third and perhaps, as it may appear in the future, the most\r\nsubstantial ground for seeking relief from the long and short haul\r\nclause in freight rates was the force of water competition. For\r\nexample, all along the Atlantic seaboard the low rates of coastwise\r\nsteamships were absolutely compelling in their effect upon through\r\nrates by rail. Obviously the railroads could not share in the\r\nbusiness, unless they met the low water rate,--a low water rate which,\r\nvery properly, ought not to affect the higher charges at interior\r\nintermediate points not enjoying such competition by water. On the\r\nother hand, it was evident that the utmost care needed to be exercised\r\nin accepting this excuse for the lower rate at the more distant point;\r\nor, otherwise stated, for higher rates at the intermediate points\r\nnot in the enjoyment of water competition. It was unquestionable, as\r\nexperience all over the country had demonstrated, that the force of\r\nsuch competition upon internal waterways had been greatly exaggerated\r\nby the railroads for their own purposes. The steamboats had disappeared\r\nfrom the Mississippi and all its branches, and from the smaller rivers\r\nof the southern states, not because they were surpassed either in\r\nspeed or in economy, but by reason of the superior organization and\r\ncertainty of through shipments by land.[753] The railroad always beat\r\nthe steamboat, mainly because it was not hampered by the difficulty\r\nof breaking bulk at transfer points. The river boat served relatively\r\nfew places, while the railroad could make connections everywhere. And,\r\nfinally, the water lines, being open at all times to competition for\r\nthe worth-while business from rivals who needed merely to assemble\r\nenough capital to buy a boat, could not distribute their margin of\r\nprofit according to the pressure of competition at different points\r\nalong every line.[754] Whether a revival of commerce upon our inland\r\nwaterways will ever change the nature of this competition between water\r\nand land transportation remains to be seen. But, in the meantime, it\r\nwas indubitable that the plea of competition by water required careful\r\nexamination before being accepted at its face value. The importance of\r\nthis consideration appears clearly in connection with the Intermountain\r\nrate cases, soon to be discussed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe petition of the Southern Pacific Railroad for exemption from the\r\nprohibition of the amended long and short haul clause in 1912,[755]\r\nas to rates between San Francisco points and Portland, Oregon,\r\npresented a concrete problem in the fair adjustment of distant and\r\nintermediate rates under the force of coastwise water competition.\r\nThere was no question as to the force of this rivalry; more than\r\nthree-fourths of the traffic between the distant seaports moving\r\nby boat. The geographical situation is shown by the map herewith.\r\nBut the difficult point to decide was as to whether the intermediate\r\nrates were not too high by comparison,--being made, in other words,\r\nto compensate unduly for the low rates and loss of traffic at the\r\ntwo ends of the line. The high intermediate point was Talent. The\r\nfirst-class San Francisco-Portland rate for 746 miles was 51 cents\r\nper hundred pounds, as against a San Francisco-Talent rate for 409\r\nmiles of $1.66,--more than three times the charge for about one-half\r\nthe haul. Moreover, the inadequacy of water competition as a full\r\nexplanation appeared at many points. Albany, for example, was no\r\nfarther from Portland than Sacramento was from San Francisco. Yet while\r\nSacramento enjoyed the low water rate north bound, neither Albany nor\r\nother places much nearer Portland were given the same advantage in\r\nsoutherly shipments. This case, left open for further examination as\r\nto facts, is also interesting as to points at law. The carrier, as in\r\nthe Intermountain rate cases, contended that under the amended long\r\nand short haul clause, the Commission need consider only the force of\r\nwater competition; and need not concern itself with the reasonableness\r\nof the intermediate rates. The Commission held this not to be a right\r\nconstruction of the law.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for seeking exception from the long and short haul clause\r\nin passenger business, judging by the petitions filed by carriers\r\nunder the new law, had to do mainly with complications following the\r\nestablishment of mileage schedules by law in the different states. Some\r\nof these states had also enacted two-cent fare laws, in which case\r\nit often happened that intrastate fares were arbitrarily higher than\r\nthose which applied on interstate business. But the main reason for\r\nseeking exemption from the Fourth Section was the desire of circuitous\r\nroutes to meet the charges made by the short lines. Obviously, as in\r\nfreight traffic, the long line could not charge more than the short\r\nline, and usually the short line made the rate. Practically under such\r\ncircumstances, the long line carrier could not well maintain a higher\r\nfare to the intermediate point, since in passenger traffic, unlike\r\nfreight, the traveller could if he pleased buy his ticket to the more\r\ndistant point and then get off at the intermediate one. The Commission,\r\nin view of this fact, naturally found less flagrant violations of the\r\ndistance principle in passenger fares than in freight rates.\r\n\r\nWhat economic reasons among all these advanced by the railroads,\r\nshould be accepted by the Commission as warranting a departure from\r\nthe distance principle? Originally, as we have seen, it was held\r\nthat competition either with carriers by water, with railroads\r\nnot subject to the Act, or other rare and peculiar cases, created\r\nsuch dissimilarity of circumstances and conditions as to warrant a\r\nmodification of the distance principle.[756] In the first great case\r\nunder the amended law, the Commission held, more broadly, that other\r\nfactors than these might properly be taken into account. It considered\r\nitself authorized not merely to decide whether circumstances in respect\r\nof competition at the two points were dissimilar, but also whether,\r\nand to what extent, that dissimilarity justified a departure from the\r\nrule. In other words, as interpreted by the Commission, modification\r\nof the rule might be permitted to just the degree which would seem to\r\nbe called for by consideration of the whole situation. The best way to\r\nunderstand the bearing of these considerations, however, will be to\r\nexamine this first great case in detail.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Intermountain rate cases, affording the first crucial test of\r\nthe long and short haul amendments of 1910, were doubly significant.\r\nThey afforded a prime example of the struggle for supremacy between\r\nthe administrative and the judicial branches of the government. And\r\nthey also stood foremost among all the transportation controversies\r\nof the last generation.[757] The grievances were long-standing. They\r\nhad been before the Interstate Commerce Commission since 1889.[758]\r\nThey comprehended geographically a range of interests covering the\r\nentire northern half of the United States. While the Rocky mountain\r\nterritory and the Pacific coast terminals were most directly concerned,\r\nthe rights in trade of every factory and distributing point east of\r\nDenver were indirectly involved, in so far as they participated in\r\ncommerce with the Far West. Not even the inevitable conflict over\r\nremodelling the southern basing point system by enforcement of the\r\nnew fourth section of the Mann-Elkins law, was equal to this one,\r\neither in geographical scope or commercial importance. And at the same\r\ntime the fact that the new Commerce Court was in 1912 on trial for\r\nits life--this being one of its leading cases on appeal--endowed the\r\ncontroversy with an even greater significance. Both in the eyes of the\r\nlaw and of commerce and finance, the issue was plainly of the first\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThe transportation grievance of the tier of Rocky mountain communities\r\nfrom Washington to Arizona, although simple, divided naturally\r\ninto two parts.[759] The first was that the freight rates from all\r\neastern territory to these localities were from one-quarter to over\r\none hundred per cent higher than to the Pacific coast, although\r\nthe goods in transit passed their very doors and might be hauled a\r\ndistance greater by one-fourth. A carload of glassware from Pittsburg\r\nto Spokane, Washington, paid a freight rate of $649.44; while the\r\ncharge to Seattle, four hundred miles farther west, was only $393.60.\r\nA first-class commodity (carload) rate from Omaha to Reno, Nevada,\r\nwas $858. If the goods were delivered 154 miles farther west, at\r\nSacramento, passing through Reno _en route_, the freight bill amounted\r\nto but six hundred dollars. But this discrimination was less than half\r\nthe indictment, inasmuch as the compelling force of ocean competition\r\nat the coast was conceded by all. It might well be that San Francisco\r\nand its sister terminal points were unreasonably favored, rather than\r\nthat the intermountain rates were unduly high in themselves. The\r\ncarriers by land might indeed be, as they alleged, powerless in the\r\nface of a water competition beyond their control. And if they were\r\nthus impotent, surely the government could not account their tariffs\r\nunlawful, however irregular they might be.\r\n\r\nThe second item in the complaint of the intermountain cities showed\r\nthe cloven hoof of the transcontinental carriers. These mountain\r\nrates, relatively so high by comparison with more remote terminals,\r\nwere equally high from every point east of Denver over a territory two\r\nthousand miles in width.[760] In other words, entirely regardless of\r\ndistance, the freight rate to Spokane or Reno, whether from New York,\r\nChicago, St. Paul, Omaha, or even Denver, was the same. It was indeed a\r\nblanket rate, like the fixed charge of two cents for postage. And it\r\nmade no difference how near any point in this wide zone might be, the\r\ndisparity in rates against the intermountain points was relatively the\r\nsame. Thus our two concrete examples, above cited, were for shipments\r\nfrom Pittsburg and Omaha, respectively; but in any case, were the point\r\nof origin as remote as Portland, Maine, or even as near as Colorado\r\n\"common points,\" the disparity of rates was unchanged. They were always\r\nvery much higher to the intermountain cities than on to the Pacific\r\ncoast; although the carriers east of the Missouri river got no more for\r\ntheir portion of the haul when the goods were bound for Spokane than if\r\nthey went on to Seattle for a much lower through charge. This latter\r\nfact, of course, narrowed the complaint down to the policy of the\r\nwestern lines. The discrimination, if it were one, was clearly of their\r\nmaking. Whatever trouble there was, originated west of the Missouri\r\nriver. However much the other railroads all over the country might have\r\njoined in transcontinental business, they remained impartial onlookers\r\nin this particular contest.\r\n\r\nSome of the causes of the apparently abnormal western rate adjustment\r\nare perfectly plain. The low rates to the coast were due to water\r\ncompetition, which, while now under some measure of railroad\r\ncontrol--partially \"neutralized\" in fact[761]--was always present\r\nand potentially great. It will be even more controlling when the\r\nPanama Canal is opened.[762] To meet this situation, the carriers had\r\nestablished a series of through commodity rates which practically\r\ncovered all transcontinental business. For all this traffic exposed\r\nto water competition, it was averred, the intermountain territory was\r\nmore remote, if not geographically, at least for purposes of rate\r\nmaking. The railroads consequently added the charge for the local\r\nhaul back from the coast to the low transcontinental or through rate\r\nin determining the charge to all the intermediate cities. Thus, they\r\nalleged, a discrimination was forced upon them, not of their own\r\ncreation. They could not grade all their intermediate rates down to a\r\nthrough tariff thus fixed at the farther end. It would mean bankruptcy.\r\nThus far the situation is analogous to Hadley's classic oyster car\r\ncase.[763] The main difficulty arose in satisfactorily explaining the\r\nsecond half of the scheme. How did the blanket or \"postage stamp\" rate\r\nzone arise, permitting exactly the same rates, whether to Spokane or\r\nSeattle, from points scattered over a territory covering practically\r\ntwo-thirds of the United States? Was it an artificial scheme,\r\nmodifiable at the will of the carriers or of the government; or, like\r\nthe law of gravitation, was it beyond the control of either?\r\n\r\nThe truth was that westbound rates from New York, Chicago, Omaha\r\nand St. Paul had come to be fixed at the same level, not by water\r\ncompetition primarily, but by the forces of commercial rivalry between\r\ncentres bidding for the far western market. They were originally\r\ngraded somewhat according to distance in the early days.[764] And it\r\nis plain that water competition, at first confined to the Atlantic\r\nseaboard, gradually extended inland. In order to secure the business to\r\nSan Francisco by steamer or clipper ship, rail charges from Pittsburg\r\nor Buffalo back to Philadelphia or New York had been absorbed in\r\nthe through rate, thus gradually extending the benefits of water\r\ncompetition farther and farther west from the seaboard cities.[765]\r\nAnd, of course, as population and manufactures grew in the Middle West,\r\nthe narrow fringe of such competition steadily and inexorably spread in\r\nfrom the Atlantic coast over a wide zone of blanket rates, all based on\r\nNew York. The direct all-rail carriers, naturally, met this competition\r\nat all points. Manufactures and population continued to spread toward\r\nthe West; but, imperceptibly, a new competitive factor appeared. As the\r\nforce of direct water competition lessened with ever-widening distance\r\ninland from the Atlantic, market competition began to gather strength.\r\nOne need not go so far as to concede that \"market competition is a\r\neuphemism for railroad policy,\" in order to realize that artificial\r\nrather than natural influences gradually came to bear in the westward\r\nextension of the blanket rate. The trans-Missouri lines, getting the\r\n_whole_ rate on shoes made in St. Louis for the Pacific slope, while\r\nonly getting a part of it if the goods came from New England, had a\r\ndirect motive to put St. Louis into the western market and thereafter\r\nto hold it there at all cost. Every increment in the St. Louis\r\ntraffic, moreover, was surely theirs for ever. It could not be stolen\r\naway by Canadian railways or ocean steamship lines, as it might if\r\nit originated at Boston. It became a settled policy of these western\r\nlines, therefore, to meet even the water-compelled seaboard rates at\r\nall points, no matter how far inland. The blanket zone thus steadily\r\nwidened, out of all semblance to its originally modest proportions as\r\nbased upon water competition alone. A competition originally natural,\r\ngradually merged into another of an entirely artificial sort.\r\n\r\nThe importance of both the intermountain and Pacific coast traffic\r\noriginating along the western confines of the blanket zone, steadily\r\nincreased. One record showed that three-fourths of the business at\r\nReno, Nevada, originated west of Chicago.[766] It all moved on the same\r\nrate as freight from Portland, Maine, whether destined to Nevada or to\r\nthe Pacific coast. The disparity against Nevada remained absolutely the\r\nsame in either case. It was to hold this traffic, originating west of\r\nChicago, against all eastern competitors, that the blanket zone was so\r\nabnormally widened by the trans-Missouri railroads.\r\n\r\nFor years the transcontinental rate scheme had been before the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission. A number of decisions[767] were\r\nrendered prior to 1910, under the old long and short haul clause,\r\nemasculated as it was by the Alabama Midland decision of 1896. The\r\nHepburn amendments of 1906 had so far strengthened the hands of the\r\nCommission that it made several attempts to deal with the question.\r\nBut the orders in these cases were confined to classified tonnage,\r\nalthough it was clear that most of the transcontinental business\r\nmoved under commodity rates. Such carload or wholesale tonnage, of\r\ncourse, was the only sort actually affected by the competition by\r\nsea. This fact greatly aggravated the discrimination against which\r\nthe intermountain cities complained. For, in absence of such water\r\ncompetition, they enjoyed relatively fewer commodity ratings. And their\r\nyouthful, though ambitious, jobbing trade was dependent upon just such\r\nspecial carload rates in competition with middlemen on the Pacific\r\ncoast. If \"tin boxes and lard pails, nested\" moved in carloads, Seattle\r\ngot them from \"anywhere east\" for a commodity rate of eighty-five\r\ncents, as against the regular fourth-class rate to Spokane of $1.90\r\nper hundred pounds. The Commission grappled with the problem of such\r\ndiscrimination manfully; but made little headway until the new law of\r\n1910 put it in better case. Then for the first time it tackled the\r\nheart of the matter, in revising the commodity rates in the great\r\ncases now under review. There is evidence that the railroads were\r\nalready endeavoring to remodel their tariffs, under pressure in some\r\ndegree from the Commission even before the amendment of the law in\r\n1910. It was recognized that some modification of the existing scheme\r\nwas needed.[768] And it was relatively easy to re-arrange mere class\r\nrates.[769] They were little affected by water competition. But the\r\ncommodity schedules, concerned in these later cases, were far more\r\nimportant commercially.\r\n\r\nTwo plans were possible to mitigate the violation of the distance\r\nprinciple.[770] The rates to intermediate points might be lowered\r\nconformably to the long-distance standard. This would enable the\r\nrailroads to hold the coast traffic against the water lines, but would\r\ndecrease the revenues from \"way\" business. Or, on the other hand,\r\nthe coast rates might be put up, regardless of water competition, in\r\nthe expectation that much through business would still go by rail.\r\nTariffs by land were already considerably higher than by the sea\r\nroutes. Possibly the rail rates might be increased somewhat further.\r\nSome coast business would be lost to the water lines, but on what\r\nremained a higher return would accrue. Moreover, a considerable\r\ndevelopment of interior distributing centres would be bound to ensue.\r\nAnd, best of all, the grievances of the interior places would be\r\nsomewhat mitigated.[771] Unfortunately the Pacific coast points were\r\nin an uproar at this threat against their supremacy in the jobbing\r\nbusiness. And, in the meantime, the new powers under which the present\r\nproceedings were taken had been conferred by the Mann-Elkins law. The\r\ncarriers unaided could probably not have greatly bettered matters.\r\nBut the government, at all events, chose to deal with it; so that\r\nthese private attempts came to naught. Subsequently such action as the\r\ncarriers took, naturally assumed the form of increases at terminals\r\nrather than reductions at intermediate points.\r\n\r\nThe new orders[772] were radically different from the preceding\r\nones, not only in applying to commodity rates, under which most of\r\nthe tonnage really moved, but also in respect of the form of remedy\r\nproposed. In order to correct the discrimination, the previous\r\ndecisions prescribed the absolute rates to be put into effect at\r\nvarious points. The new orders did not establish absolute rates at\r\nall, but endeavored, instead, to set up a system of relative rates or\r\ndifferentials. All the former decisions had held the intermountain\r\nrates inherently unreasonable. The new opinions treated them as\r\nonly relatively so. A clear distinction was drawn between real\r\nwater competition and that _pseudo_ water competition which, as has\r\nbeen said, resolved itself practically into a mere competition of\r\nmarkets with one another. The guiding principle adopted was that\r\nthe force of water competition,--the only one entirely beyond the\r\ncarriers' control,--of necessity increased with the proximity of\r\nthe shipping-point to the Atlantic seaboard. Business from New York\r\nto Seattle by rail had to go at rates compelled by the rivalry of\r\nsteamship lines. Traffic from Omaha to Reno, Nevada, was surely free\r\nfrom it. Yet under the then existing system no distinction whatever\r\nwas made between the two sets of circumstances. All rates were\r\nblanketed, regardless of remoteness from the eastern seaports. The new\r\ngovernmental order substituted a series of zones suggestive of those\r\nso long prevalent in trunk line territory.[773] These are shown by\r\nthe map on page 618. As one passed westward from zone IV, with water\r\ncompetition under full pressure at New York, the influence of the\r\nroundabout carriers by sea progressively diminished; until, at last,\r\nbeyond the Missouri it became _nil_. Such water competition affording\r\nthe only pretext for a grant of lower rates to the Pacific terminals\r\nthan to intermountain points, it followed, logically, that the\r\ndisparity in charges between such interior and coastal places should\r\ndecrease _pari passu_ with the westward movement of the originating\r\npoint. A substantially lower rate from New York to San Francisco than\r\nfrom New York to Nevada might be permitted; but no such difference,\r\nrelatively, ought to obtain from St. Paul or Omaha to San Francisco\r\nas compared with Rocky mountain territory. For these inland initial\r\npoints were practically beyond the range of steamship rivalry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the Commission in these orders forbade any higher charge\r\nto the mountain points from any part of zone I than applied to the\r\nPacific terminals. From zone II, lying four hundred miles more to the\r\neast, there would probably never be any considerable traffic coming\r\nback to New York in order to go round by sea, but in rare instances\r\nthere might be some. From this zone, therefore, intermountain rates\r\nmight be not more than seven per cent. above those to the Pacific\r\nterminals. And so on as one went east. Rates from zone III might be\r\nnot more than fifteen per cent. higher to Spokane than to Seattle.\r\nFrom zone IV to Rocky mountain territory they might be twenty-five\r\nper cent, above those to San Francisco; but the disparity against the\r\nintermountain territory, even from here with water competition in full\r\neffect, must never exceed this percentage.\r\n\r\nThis ingenious plan certainly commends itself in principle to the\r\neconomic student. It restored in a measure the gradations existing\r\nin 1887.[774] It did not create the zones out of whole cloth. It\r\nutilized a scheme for division of territory already adopted by the\r\ntranscontinental lines for other purposes.[775] And, most important\r\nof all, it was elastic, not prescribing absolute rates, but resting\r\ncontent with laying emphasis upon the need of gradation. Yet it granted\r\na substantial measure of relief from the present disparity of rates.\r\nFor, whereas the former intermountain tariffs from the East were from\r\nfifty to one hundred per cent, above those to the Pacific coast, the\r\ndifference under this order might never exceed twenty-five per cent.\r\nThe new scheme was cleverly planned, also, from a legal-strategic point\r\nof view. It could scarcely be attacked under the Fourteenth Amendment\r\nas confiscatory, inasmuch as it left so much latitude to the carriers\r\nin the readjustment of their tariffs.[776] To overset it on this\r\nground, they must prove that disaster would result from the particular\r\nrates which they had chosen to adopt. This would be an impossible task.\r\nThe only choice remaining to the carriers, therefore, would be to\r\nattack the order on the ground that the Commission was exceeding its\r\npowers, delegated by Congress. This, in effect, was what was done.[777]\r\n\r\nThe opinion of the Commerce Court,[778] setting aside the intermountain\r\nrate orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission, will shortly be\r\nreviewed by the Supreme Court of the United States, to which tribunal\r\nappeal was promptly taken.[779] Disregarding the dissenting opinion\r\nthat the entire long and short haul clause, as amended in 1910, was\r\nunconstitutional, there were three significant differences between the\r\ntwo tribunals.\r\n\r\nThe first point at issue between the court and the Commission\r\nconcerned the differentiation of water competition from so-called\r\nmarket competition.[780] The Commerce Court refused to recognize any\r\ndistinction between the cause of lower rates to the Pacific coast from\r\nOmaha or from New York, respectively. It ascribed the disparity in all\r\ncases to competitive forces entirely beyond the railroads' control \"If\r\nthe carrier from St. Paul, in order to meet new water competition from\r\nNew York,\" etc. The Commission, on the other hand, clearly set apart\r\nmarket competition, applicable to western cities, from that due to\r\ncarriage by water, which controlled rates from the Atlantic seaboard.\r\nThe railways, it said, must conform in their rate-making policies to\r\nthe latter. They were not bound by the former. For market competition\r\n(as already quoted) \"is a euphemism for railroad policy.\"[781] And,\r\nspeaking as an economist, ignorant of the technicalities of the\r\nlaw, I venture to affirm that the Commission in this contention was\r\nabsolutely right.[782] Even as far west as South Bend, Indiana, wagons\r\nmay go to California by the direct rail route; or, with a change of\r\nten cents in the rate, they may come back to New York and thence go\r\nround by sea. Such is the delicacy of adjustment even as far west\r\nas Chicago. Hence the failure to recognize that low rates to the\r\nPacific coast from points west of the Missouri river were due to an\r\nentirely different cause--namely, the arbitrary determination of the\r\ntranscontinental lines to hold the fort for their local clients against\r\nall odds--was to commit an egregious economic blunder. Furniture goes\r\nfrom Chicago to San Francisco on rates as low as if compelled by water\r\ncompetition.[783] But steamships never carry commodities of this bulky\r\nsort, even from New York. How much less, then, could water competition\r\napply so far inland? The carriers were bent on keeping Chicago in the\r\nPacific market. That was the real reason. The Commerce Court clearly\r\nmissed the main point.\r\n\r\nEqually sound economic evidence that water competition alone was not\r\nresponsible for the entire present transcontinental rate system, was\r\nafforded by the fact that the wide blanket zone, already described,\r\ncovering two-thirds of the United States for westbound rates, found\r\nno counterpart in the scheme under which rates were made up in the\r\nopposite direction.[784] It is a poor rule which will not work both\r\nways. And surely water competition, when present, should be potent\r\nin either direction. It was undeniable that the absence of pushing\r\ncities along the Pacific slope, desirous of developing trade relations\r\nwith the Atlantic states, discouraged even the slightest extension of\r\nterminal rates inland. The ironclad monopoly enjoyed by the Harriman\r\nand Hill lines would probably have prevented this in any event. But\r\nthe significant point was that there was no demand for a blanket zone\r\nfor eastbound traffic. Hence water-compelled rates staid where they\r\nbelonged; that is to say, closely confined to the Pacific seaboard\r\ncities. Thus it would also have been in the eastern half of the\r\ncountry, had it not been for \"market competition\"--this artificial\r\nfactor which the Commerce Court failed utterly to recognize as in a\r\nclass by itself.\r\n\r\nThe second vital difference of opinion between the Commerce Court and\r\nthe Commission was economico-legal. The economist in the office of\r\ncritic here stands upon less firm ground. And yet, whatever the law\r\nmay be, the reasoning rests upon the interpretation of the facts.[785]\r\nThe Commerce Court held that \"when the rate for the longer haul is\r\nforced unreasonably low by competition, the only elements that can\r\nenter into the consideration of the rate for the shorter haul are its\r\nreasonableness,\" etc.[786] The controlling idea, in other words, in\r\nthe reviewing judicial mind, was that, so long as the rate at Spokane\r\nor Reno was reasonable _in itself_, it was a matter of indifference\r\nto that locality what rate might be made to Seattle. All that the\r\nCommerce Court needed to do, therefore, was to consider the \"intrinsic\r\nreasonableness\"[787] of the intermediate rate. Not so, held the\r\nCommission. Whether this charge was reasonable or not was a question\r\nof relativity. It depended upon what rate was made to other points all\r\naround it and competitive with it. In other words, the intermediate\r\ncould not be dissociated from the long-distance point. Railroads as\r\npublic carriers owed a common duty to both points. No intermediate\r\nrate, however low _per se_, could be reasonable, if the carrier was\r\nvoluntarily offering a lower rate to points beyond. If its lower rate\r\nbeyond was accorded under compulsion, that of course was a different\r\nmatter. But in so far as these low Pacific terminal rates were due to\r\nan artificial railroad policy, any discrimination against the nearer\r\npoints was unwarranted.\r\n\r\nThe analogy is clear between this difference of opinion of Commission\r\nand court and that between the two schools which would base judicial\r\ndetermination of rates in general upon inherent or relative\r\nreasonableness, respectively. The \"remuneration\" test, which the\r\ncarriers' representatives sought to insert in the law of 1906, seeks\r\nto discover innate reasonableness of rates; not affected, that is to\r\nsay, by the revenue which may accrue from them in the aggregate. The\r\nother standard declares such reasonableness to be always dependent\r\nupon circumstances; notably upon the amount of the investment and the\r\nresultant earning power arising out of the volume of business carried\r\nat the rates in question.[788]\r\n\r\nThe third difference of opinion between court and Commission was\r\npurely one of law.[789] Had the latter exceeded its powers delegated\r\nby Congress in attempting to fix a _relation_ of rates, instead of\r\nprescribing certain maximum rates applicable to particular points?[790]\r\nThe reasoning followed was apparently derived from the Supreme\r\nCourt opinion in the Chattanooga case.[791] This reasoning, the\r\ngovernment now contended in its argument on appeal to that tribunal,\r\nwas inapplicable to the since amended law. Limits of space and the\r\nnatural diffidence of an economist, alike forbid extended discussion\r\nof this nice point at law. The Commission alleged that, except by\r\nthe exercise of such authority to prescribe relativity of rates,\r\nit would be powerless to remedy such discriminations in future. In\r\nconsequence, inasmuch as Congress evidently intended to enable it to\r\nafford such remedy, authority over relativity of rates must be derived\r\nby necessary implication. And it is certain, economically speaking,\r\nthat in this position the Commission was once more perfectly right.\r\nWhether it was legally so remained yet to be decided.[792] In this\r\nconnection, it seems odd that none of the briefs for the government\r\nmentioned an important instance of the undisputed exercise of such\r\npower to establish relativity of rates. The Commission had for years,\r\neven in absence of any express authorization by law until 1910, freely\r\nprescribed details of freight classification in a large number of\r\nimportant cases.[793] It had never done more than to fix relativity;\r\nand the constitutionality of its orders had never been attacked.\r\n\r\nAn entirely new issue arose at this point. Prescribing relativity\r\nof rates implied determination of minimum rates. For if, as in this\r\ntranscontinental case, the freight rate to Nevada points from New York\r\nmight never be more than twenty-five per cent. greater than to San\r\nFrancisco, a lower limit as well as an upper one was thereby prescribed\r\nfor the latter point, and _vice versa_. The rate to one point once\r\nfixed by the carrier, voluntarily if you please, the minimum rate to\r\nthe other might be necessarily determined thereby. If a dollar rate\r\nprevailed at Spokane, the Seattle rate must not fall below seventy-five\r\ncents. Was this not something new? Did it not suggest fixing, not\r\nmaximum rates alone, but absolute rates as well? And if an attempt to\r\nfix absolute rates, was it not unconstitutional? There could be no two\r\nminds about the need of conferring power upon the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission over minimum or differential rates, if effective government\r\nregulation were ever to be attained. This had been my contention for\r\nyears.[794] It had the best possible expert support from the side\r\nof the carriers.[795] Discriminatory rates could never be corrected\r\nuntil such power was delegated by Congress or conferred by judicial\r\ninterpretation of the law. Kansas City now enjoys lower rates to\r\nChicago on packing-house products than are accorded to Omaha. On every\r\nsound principle of rate making, the two cities ought to be placed on a\r\nparity. But the Commission could not rectify the abuse; for the roads\r\nfrom Kansas City promptly reduced their rates _pari passu_ with any\r\nreduction of the charge at Omaha.[796] There was no bed rock below\r\nwhich rates could not go. The Omaha railroads as well as the government\r\nwere powerless in face of the situation.\r\n\r\nMay power to fix minimum rates, so necessary to an adequate program\r\nof control, be constitutionally delegated by Congress? The question\r\nhas never been squarely presented to the Supreme Court.[797] But the\r\nlanguage in many cases has been such as to indicate that maximum rates\r\nalone may be lawfully established. Is the reiteration of the word\r\n\"maximum\" intentional? Or may it be that the judicial mind has never\r\nyet contemplated the need of regulating the minimum rate? Surely it\r\nseems an anomaly that the government should ever seek to fix such a\r\nlower limit, _below_ which compensation may not be had. And yet many\r\ncases show that it is absolutely necessary, to the end that justice\r\nmay be done. Or may the unconstitutionality of fixing minimum rates\r\ndepend upon the fact that, if thus prescribed along with maximum\r\nrates, it will amount, practically, to determination of the absolute\r\nrate--the bogey which the carriers seem most of all to hold in dread?\r\nInteresting and inviting possibilities of judicial interpretation are\r\nindeed suggested along this line, were there opportunity to pursue them\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[746] The history of the clause will be found at pp. 473 and 564,\r\n_supra_.\r\n\r\n[747] Digest of the Hearings, Appendix III, Dec. 15, 1905, pp. 1-244.\r\nAn excellent body of unworked economic data on rate making is here\r\nafforded.\r\n\r\n[748] P. 240, _supra_.\r\n\r\n[749] 25th Ann.

The first real step was taken by Massachusetts in 1869. The\r\nRailroad Commission created in that year has served ever since as a\r\nmodel of the so-called \"weak\" or \"advisory\" type of regulation. Others\r\nof this sort were more common in the eastern states. Such commissions,\r\nin Massachusetts for example, rely mainly upon public opinion for the\r\nenforcement of their decisions. They possess very limited authority\r\nover rates, although they are empowered to recommend such changes as\r\nmay be deemed advisable. Back of this authority, of course, lies the\r\nlegislative power of the General Court, invoked on special occasions.\r\nBut, in general, the activities of the Massachusetts type of commission\r\nhave been mainly confined to supervision, either of construction or of\r\ncapitalization.[799] New York and several other states conformed in\r\nthe main to this type, although none of them had any authority over\r\nmatters of finance. A second variety of the older railroad commissions\r\ndates from the period of the Granger Movement in the West. Maximum\r\nrate laws were passed by a number of commonwealths in the seventies,\r\nnotably Illinois, Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin. The outcome of\r\nthis legislation was the decision of the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates, elsewhere discussed,[800] holding that state legislatures had\r\nthe power to fix rates. The so-called \"strong\" commissions had their\r\nrise in connection with these events. Railway boards of this second\r\ntype exercised control over rates in two ways; namely, by means of\r\nthe promulgation of freight classifications and the prescription of\r\nmaximum distance tariffs. For the purposes of such regulation most of\r\nthe western states grouped the carriers according to their earning\r\ncapacity, with a different schedule in each case. In certain of the\r\nsouthern states these older commissions adopted even more drastic\r\npolicies which brought about prolonged litigation. The peculiar case of\r\nTexas, adding financial legislation to the direct prescription of rate\r\nschedules, has been discussed by itself.[801]\r\n\r\nA new chapter in railroad regulation by the separate states dates from\r\nthe general public unrest and Congressional activity of the Roosevelt\r\nperiod. An almost frenzied activity after 1900 culminated in 1907\r\nin a legislative wave which swept over the entire country. No less\r\nthan fifteen new or remodelled commissions were created in the two\r\nyears 1905-1907, bringing the total number by 1908 to thirty-nine.\r\nPractically all of these were of the so-called \"strong\" type; that is\r\nto say, possessing the most extensive powers over all matters of rate\r\noperation and in many cases of finance as well. The most notable of\r\nthese, of course, were the so-called Public Utility Commissions of\r\nWisconsin (1905) and New York (1907). The subjugation of the formerly\r\ndominant railway interests in New Jersey and Pennsylvania was also\r\nhighly significant.[802] The movement even invaded the New England\r\nStates,--so long a sanctuary of the \"weak\" or advisory commission.\r\nVermont and New Hampshire set up powerful boards, and Massachusetts,\r\nin 1913, amplified the powers of its commission in harmony with the\r\ngeneral movement. Several features of this new lot of state commissions\r\ncontrast markedly with even the old-fashioned \"strong\" type. Many of\r\nthem permit the fixing of absolute rates. The majority now provide\r\nfor appointment rather than election of the commissioners; and also\r\nby salary and in other ways enhance the dignity of the office. This\r\noperates naturally to lift these boards out of a semi-political\r\natmosphere formerly too characteristic in many cases; and to bring them\r\nmore to a par with the state courts.\r\n\r\nThe \"Wisconsin Idea,\" achieving its full flower under the remarkable\r\nleadership of Governor La Follette in 1905, ably seconded by a number\r\nof prominent University of Wisconsin men, notably Hon. B. H. Meyer,\r\nnow a member of the Interstate Commerce Commission, most completely\r\nrealizes the progressive policy of sane state regulation.[803] The\r\nprinciple is laid down \"that it was as much the duty of the state to\r\nfurnish transportation facilities as it ever had been to make roads or\r\nbuild bridges; and that if the function was delegated to any one, it\r\nwas the duty of the state to regulate it so that the agent should be\r\nrequired to furnish adequate service, reasonable rates, and practise\r\nno discrimination.\" And, it is added, that this procedure should be\r\n\"so simple that a man can write his complaint on the back of a postal\r\ncard, and if it is a just one, the state will take it up for him.\"\r\nThe three fundamental principles of the Wisconsin programme, now\r\nhappily incorporated in the Federal law, were full authority over\r\nfuture rates; secured without expense to the complainant; and with the\r\nburden of proof laid upon the railroad in cases of appeal. In short,\r\nthe Wisconsin plan provided for thoroughgoing administrative control,\r\nthat is to say, with strict limitation of judicial review to the\r\ndetermination of points at law. The issues were in no wise different\r\nfrom those already discussed heretofore in connection with the\r\ndevelopment of the recent Federal policy; except possibly in respect\r\nof the persistency of opposition, which has had to be overcome more\r\ngradually in the Senate of the United States,--the natural stronghold\r\nof corporate influence.\r\n\r\nThe creation of powerful state commissions since 1905 has, oddly\r\nenough, been accompanied by a great activity of the state governments\r\nin the enactment of statutes aiming independently to regulate common\r\ncarriers. Laws of this class are not new. As far back as 1890 there\r\nwere twenty-two maximum rate and fare statutes. A period of quiescence,\r\nmarked by only four such laws in twelve years, was followed by the\r\npassage within five years to 1907 of no less than twenty-two maximum\r\nfare laws and nine maximum rate schedules.[804] To these may be added a\r\nlarge grist of statutes dealing with almost every detail of operation\r\nor service. Demurrage, provision for terminals, train service and\r\nconnections, distribution of cars, industrial and spur tracks, and\r\nhours of labor, may be cited among a host of others.\r\n\r\nThe activities of state governments in recent years in the creation\r\nof powerful railroad commissions, with the added grist of drastic\r\nindependent statutes, have greatly emphasized the eternal conflict\r\nof authority between the state and Federal governments, as well as\r\nbetween the different states. Problems akin to those raised by the\r\ndiversity of our laws respecting marriage, labor, and bankruptcy have\r\nbeen forced upon the attention of Congress and the Federal courts.\r\nReasonable coöperation might be counted upon to accomplish something;\r\nbut the course of events since 1905 points to the necessity of a\r\nfinal settlement of this important issue as far as common carriers\r\nare concerned, so authoritatively that a greater measure of political\r\nand industrial peace may prevail in future. The situation respecting\r\nrailroads was well described by Justice McKenna of the United States\r\nSupreme Court in an opinion annulling the North Carolina law requiring\r\nrailroads to receive goods for interstate transportation whether\r\nthey had published rates for the proposed shipment or not;--\"if the\r\ncarrier obeys the state law, he incurs the penalty of the Federal\r\nlaw; if he obeys the Federal law, he insures the penalty of the state\r\nlaw. Manifestly, one authority must be paramount, and when it speaks,\r\nthe other must be silent.\" It may be added that in this recent case,\r\nfollowing the inevitable trend of events it was the state law upon\r\nwhich the penalty of silence was visited.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate ramifications of a state law under the complexities of\r\nmodern railway rate adjustment and operation can never be foreseen.\r\nIt is not simply a question of avoiding conflict between distance\r\ntariffs and classifications.[805] Oftentimes the most modest rules\r\nand regulations may lead to results affecting commerce over a wide\r\narea. The great increase in large cars throughout the West, by contrast\r\nwith other parts of the country, as traceable to the establishment by\r\nMissouri of minimum carloads,[806] is a case in point. We have also\r\nalready observed how the revised milk laws of Massachusetts opened\r\nup an issue covering all of New England.[807] And then there are the\r\nvarious attempts of the railroad commissions, notably Texas[808] and\r\nMinnesota, to set up schemes of rates which shall concentrate the\r\ndistributive business of the community in local cities as against\r\nthe competition of jobbers at a distance. The extreme confusion\r\nintroduced in matters of classification by conflicting authorities\r\nhas already reached a point where demand for the substitution of a\r\nsingle uniform schedule for the United States has become wellnigh\r\nirresistible.[809] There are also conflicts respecting laws regulating\r\nservice, illustrated by the Supreme Court decision in 1907, holding\r\nthat the attempt of North Carolina to require through fast mail\r\ntrains to stop at small way stations, was unconstitutional;[810] and\r\nfinally, some agreement as to division of accounts between interstate\r\nand intrastate business will at once be recognized as an essential to\r\nthe determination of reasonable rates for through and local service\r\nrespectively.[811] From every side, in short, the need of a clear\r\nseparation of state and Federal powers is becoming more and more\r\ninsistent.\r\n\r\nThe conflict between general and local authority came to a head in\r\n1907, resulting in a violent clash between the Federal and state\r\ncourts.[812] The worst complication arose in the South, particularly\r\nin North Carolina and Alabama. Certain railroads brought suit in\r\nthe Federal courts to annul rates fixed by the state legislatures;\r\nand temporary Federal injunctions were at once issued suspending the\r\nstatutes until determination of their constitutionality. Popular\r\nfeeling was much aroused, and local officials sought vigorously\r\nto defend states' rights. Ticket agents collecting more than the\r\nstate-prescribed fare, were condemned to the chain gang and the\r\npresident of the railroad company was arrested. Federal judges promptly\r\nreleased all parties by writs of _habeas corpus_. A truce was finally\r\npatched up, pending determination of the matter at issue by the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States. The final and inevitable outcome,\r\nof course, was a decision by this tribunal, upholding the authority\r\nof the general government.[813] Technically, the question in these\r\ncases concerned the power of the Federal courts to issue temporary\r\ninjunctions suspending state laws; or, in other words, raising the\r\nnice distinction as to whether a suit against a state officer was a\r\nsuit against the state or not. Various other legal technicalities were\r\ninvolved both in North Carolina and Alabama. The main issue has been\r\ndealt with for the future by a special clause of the Mann-Elkins law\r\nof 1910. This provides that a petition for an injunction suspending a\r\nstate law, shall be heard by three Federal judges, one at least of a\r\nsuperior court. Five days' notice is required; and there is a direct\r\nappeal to the Supreme Court of the United States. But an injunction,\r\nthus issued, is given clear precedence over any statute regarding\r\ncommon carriers emanating from authority of an individual state.\r\n\r\nThe state of Missouri has had a trying experience. This occurred in\r\nconnection with a statute of 1907 reducing passenger rates from three\r\nto two cents a mile. Federal judges promptly granted injunctions\r\nagainst the enforcement of this statute. The state's Attorney-General\r\nin the meantime cited the railroads into the state courts to show cause\r\nfor failing to obey. The compromise in this case took the form of an\r\nagreement to give the new law a trial of several months in order to\r\ntest the financial effect of the reduction in fares. Then followed an\r\ninterchange of injunctions, quite characteristic of the old days of the\r\nErie Railroad, save for the integrity of the judges concerned. To this\r\nthere then succeeded a decision by the Federal Circuit Court that the\r\nrates were confiscatory; although for some reason the two-cent fares\r\nand other reduced charges remained practically in effect. Controversies\r\nsimilar to this have arisen since 1907 in some seven different states.\r\nOregon and West Virginia took issue as to the validity of two-cent\r\npassenger fare laws. In the latter case, the state supreme court held\r\nthat the statute was not confiscatory. In Oregon the lower Federal\r\ncourt upheld the state law. The contest from Kentucky involved the\r\nconstitutionality of a state railroad commission act, already held\r\nunconstitutional in the United States Circuit Court. The Arkansas\r\nappeal had mainly to do with maximum rate laws in relation to physical\r\nvaluation of property; and in Ohio, the validity of a state rate on\r\ncoal to Lake Erie was in dispute. The railroad contended that the\r\ntraffic was interstate commerce, a contention denied by the state\r\nauthorities.[814] The Minnesota case,--perhaps the most voluminous in\r\nits record of all,--had primarily to do with the confiscatory nature\r\nof reductions of intrastate rates: and this in turn hinged upon the\r\nmode of separating accounts.[815] A distinct affirmation of Federal\r\nsupremacy has also been had by a Circuit Court opinion in 1911. All\r\nthese cases are at this writing (1912) before the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States for decision. The main issue is pooled by agreement\r\nbetween the governors of the seven commonwealths concerned. The outcome\r\ncannot fail to be of the utmost importance,--far-reaching in its effect\r\nnot only upon the regulation of railways but throughout the entire\r\nfield of constitutional law. Such decisions as the Supreme Court has\r\nalready rendered in connection with these matters having been entirely\r\nfavorable to Federal authority, undoubtedly in this instance induced\r\nthe joint action of the state executives for mutual protection and\r\nsupport. There can be no doubt that a sweeping decision, upholding\r\nFederal authority, will go far to solidify control by the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission. It will also clear the air and greatly simplify\r\nthe problem of operation by the managements of the railroads, not only\r\nin these seven states but all over the United States as well.\r\n\r\nThe delicate balance between state and Federal authority over\r\ncommerce is also in a way to be tested in what promises to become an\r\nhistoric case before the Interstate Commerce Commission,--historic\r\nin the sense that its final adjudication by the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States will add a positive contribution to the body of our\r\nfundamental law.[816] It may best be understood by first gaining\r\na clear idea of the nature of the economic grievance. Shreveport,\r\nLouisiana, is situated on the Red river, an important tributary of\r\nthe Mississippi, some 190 miles distant from Dallas and 231 miles\r\nfrom Houston,--both of the latter being important and ambitious\r\nprovincial distributing points in Texas. Shreveport, enjoying the\r\nbenefits of water competition,--probably more keen historically than\r\nat present,--was granted correspondingly low carload rates by rail\r\non merchandise from the north and east. These favorable rates were\r\nnot extended to the two Texas cities, inasmuch as water competition\r\nwas entirely absent. Naturally, therefore, an advantage was given\r\nto the Louisiana city in competition for distributive business in\r\nall the intermediate territory and even over in the _Hinterland_ in\r\nTexas. In pursuance of a long-standing policy of encouraging the\r\ngrowth of provincial jobbing points within its own borders,[817] the\r\nTexas Railroad Commission proceeded to overcome this disability by\r\nprescribing relatively low rates out of Dallas and Houston as compared\r\nwith the rates from Shreveport to the same points. It seems even to\r\nhave gone further and to have interposed positive barriers against the\r\ncompetition of Shreveport jobbers in Texas territory, by somewhat more\r\nthan compensating for the low water rates at Shreveport. The disparity\r\nthus set up may be best illustrated by the following table of charges\r\nfor approximately equal distances.\r\n\r\n                   _Rates in cents per hundredweight_\r\n\r\n                                                         CLASS\r\n                                                         1   E\r\n                                                         ------\r\n  From Dallas to Big Sandy, Texas           101 miles    44  13\r\n  From Shreveport, La., to Crow, Texas.     100 miles    95  18\r\n  From Houston to Renova, Texas             103 miles    45  14\r\n  From Shreveport, La., to Angeline, Texas  104 miles    68  15\r\n\r\nStated in another way, sixty cents would carry one hundred pounds of\r\nfirst-class traffic some 160 miles out of Dallas into eastern Texas;\r\nwhile an equal rate out of Shreveport into the same Texas territory,\r\nwest bound, was exacted for a haul of only fifty-five miles,--about\r\none-third the distance.\r\n\r\nThe Commission decided upon the evidence by a bare majority that these\r\nTexas tariffs were unduly preferential; and ordered them to be so\r\nreadjusted that the charges should be the same for equal distances\r\nfrom all three cities regardless of state lines. Concerning the minor\r\npoint that it was lawful for a carrier to equalize conditions as\r\nbetween two competing places by imposing high local rates upon one\r\npoint in order to offset the advantages as to inbound through rates\r\nenjoyed by the other, the Commission merely re-affirmed its belief that\r\nnatural advantages of geographical location could not lawfully thus be\r\nnullified.[818]\r\n\r\nThe opinion rendered in this case is remarkable, less in its economic\r\naspects, concerning which there seems not to have been any great\r\ndiversity of view, than as regards the divergent views expressed as to\r\nthe legal authority of the Commission to interfere in the matter at\r\nall. Was undue preference and advantage in the eyes of the law,--the\r\ndecision being rendered under the third section of the act,--created by\r\nthe set of circumstances above described? At this point the Commission\r\ndivided, with no fewer than two concurring and two dissenting opinions\r\nadded to the majority view. According to this last, not only was\r\nthe power of Congress to legislate in such matters paramount, but\r\nit was also held that this supreme power to put an end to all forms\r\nof local discrimination,--even those created by the act of state\r\nauthorities,--had been delegated by Congress to the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission. And in such instances, wherein conflict arose between\r\nFederal and state authority, the only rational and possible course, it\r\nwas held, was for the national government through its administrative\r\nagent \"to assume its constitutional right to lead.\"\r\n\r\nThe three separate dissenting opinions are of interest as expressing\r\nthe need of a definitive pronouncement upon this great question by the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States. Not alone as to whether Congress\r\nintended to delegate authority to the Commission to settle such issues,\r\nbut even the right of Congress itself to pass upon them under the\r\nFederal constitution, were called in question by the members of this\r\nadministrative board. Two dissenters were content to submit the matter\r\nto \"the august tribunal of the people which is continually sitting\"\r\nto choose between submitting to such grievances as an alternative for\r\nvirtually legislating state authority out of existence. The third\r\ndissentient view was more thoroughgoing. It not only discovered,\r\nlegally speaking, no undue discrimination in the circumstances. It\r\npointed out that on reducing the Shreveport local tariff \"we fix\r\ninterstate rates by the Texas yardstick,\" whereby \"the national\r\ngovernment therefore _leads_ by _following_.\" It concluded by affirming\r\nthat the Commission \"should confine itself within the four corners of\r\nthe law of its creation, usurping neither the legislative function of\r\nthe Congress nor the judicial power of the courts.\" From all of which\r\nit is clear, first, that the Supreme Court of the United States, having\r\nonce clearly defined the jurisdiction of the Federal government in such\r\nmatters, it may, in the second place, well be that further amendment of\r\nthe Act to Regulate Commerce will be in order.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is pertinent, apropos of the approaching completion\r\nof the Panama Canal and the intensified interest in a more complete\r\nutilization of our internal waterways, to discuss briefly the relation\r\nbetween railroads and carriers by boat. The most stupendous canal\r\nprojects are being brought forward, in the expectation that they will\r\nnot only provide for a vast amount of low-grade traffic in themselves,\r\nbut also that through the forces of competition they will bring about a\r\nsubstantial lowering of charges by railway. The most ambitious of these\r\nenterprises is the plan for a \"Lakes to the Gulf\" ship canal, even\r\ncomprehending the dream of a twenty-four foot channel down the course\r\nof the Mississippi. Another and more modest proposition, probably\r\npracticable, is the construction of a canal from Lake Erie to the Ohio\r\nriver. Altogether it has been credibly estimated[819] that the entire\r\nscheme for internal improvements of this sort would call for an outlay\r\nof not less than $2,000,000,000. Before engaging in any experiments\r\nupon such a magnificent scale, it is certainly proper to enquire\r\nwhether the results will be in any way commensurate with their cost.\r\n\r\nThe cost of water carriage, like that of transportation by rail, should\r\nat the outset be divided into two distinct parts; one of which varies\r\nmore or less in proportion to the volume of traffic, while the other,\r\nconcerned with fixed charges on the investment, maintenance and\r\ndepreciation, is constant. The latter in other words bears little or no\r\nrelation to the tonnage transported.[820] A careful distinction between\r\nthese two great groups of expenditures is of fundamental importance\r\nin any comparison between rail and water carriage. The failure to\r\nso distinguish is responsible for much of the fallacious reasoning\r\nupon the subject both in and outside of the halls of Congress. It\r\nis indisputable that mere operating expenses are very much less by\r\nboat than by rail, especially when the economies of large craft can\r\nbe had. The phenomenal development of commerce upon the Great Lakes,\r\nespecially for the carriage of iron ore, coal and lumber, is due to\r\nthis fact.[821] But, on the other hand, it is equally clear that the\r\nsecond great group of expenditures, particularly the fixed charges due\r\nto the enormous first cost of construction, are very much greater by\r\nartificial waterways than by rail. The balance between low operating\r\ncosts and heavy fixed charges, of course, will be struck according to\r\nthe nature of the particular enterprise. And canals, being entirely\r\nartificial, offer the least advantageous opportunity for realization of\r\nthe economies incident to movement of freight by water.[822]\r\n\r\nImproved riverways are economical by comparison with canals just in\r\nproportion to their lessened first cost; but, on the other hand,\r\nmere movement expenses, maintenance and depreciation are apt to be\r\nhigher according to the strength of the current. In each instance\r\neverything depends upon first cost and the consequent burden of fixed\r\ncharges. This point is almost totally neglected in popular discussion\r\nof the subject. Internal waterways being, without exception, public\r\nenterprises, the burden of interest charges is generally put aside as\r\nof no consequence. Naturally therefore, these being eliminated, the\r\napparent economy of carriage by water is mirrored forth with great\r\neffect.[823]\r\n\r\nThe experience of Germany, so often adduced in favor of water carriage,\r\nwhen examined in the light of the foregoing economic principles, is\r\npeculiarly illuminating. Much traffic, to be sure, moves apparently\r\nwith greater cheapness than by rail upon both canals and rivers.\r\nConsidering the tariffs which are based upon movement expenses\r\nalone, excluding, that is to say, any adequate return upon the total\r\ninvestment, such methods of transportation seem very economical\r\nand highly effective. But when _total_ costs, rather than merely\r\npartial ones, are considered, the picture is completely reversed. The\r\nDortmund-Ems canal, for instance, certainly the most important in\r\nGermany, represents an investment per mile fifty per cent. greater\r\nthan the average for German railways.[824] For the single year 1905,\r\nthe contributions from the states and cities interested, amounted to\r\na subsidy of about $900,000. This financial burden, if distributed\r\nover the total tonnage, would make the entire cost of operation nearly\r\none-fourth greater than the average by rail.\r\n\r\nRivers, as we have seen, possess certain advantages over canals, mainly\r\nin proportion to the lessened first cost of their improvement. The\r\nRhine is often cited as an example of what the Mississippi should be\r\nas a great channel of commerce; but again that fatal objection of the\r\nfirst cost and, in the case of the Mississippi, of maintenance must\r\nalways be kept in mind. The Rhine like the Hudson river or the St.\r\nLawrence is, indeed, naturally adapted for carriage by water. Its firm\r\nbanks, gentle gradient and constancy of level, are all elements in its\r\nfavor. But it is certainly futile to anticipate similar results on the\r\nMississippi or its tributaries,--huge and inconstant leviathans as they\r\nare, traversing a great alluvial plain devoid of solid foundations of\r\nany sort. The fact that today with a nine foot channel, Pittsburg\r\nmakes no use of the Ohio river for its shipments of iron and steel,\r\nbut sends them to the Pacific coast by way of New York, certainly does\r\nnot augur well for the success of even an enlarged riverway in future,\r\nexcept possibly as to coal. Of course, if the government is to write\r\noff all the original investment, shifting the incidence to the general\r\ntaxpayers of the country, that is a different matter. But unless the\r\nstate thus chooses to subsidize the enterprise entirely, the total cost\r\nof transportation by rail will continue to be in future as it has been\r\nin the past, substantially lower than by the older and now antiquated\r\nmethods of transportation. If the end in view be the attainment of the\r\nlowest possible rates, why not subsidize the railroads directly by this\r\nsame amount? or even buy them up and operate them for cost? The expense\r\nto the taxpayers would be no more; and this plan would unquestionably\r\ngive far better results. Even the electrically-towed canal boat is not\r\nto be compared for efficiency in reaching all parts of the country\r\nwithout transhipment, with giant locomotives, low grades, heavy rails\r\nand large train loads.\r\n\r\nThe ownership or control of water carriers by railroads constitutes a\r\ntroublesome feature of present day conditions. Peculiar prominence,\r\nlegislatively speaking, was given to it because of the attempt in 1912\r\nto combine legislation dealing with this possible evil with the matter\r\nof Panama Canal tolls and regulations. Such control of water lines in\r\ncompetition with railways is matter of public record.[825] Much of\r\nthe coastwise traffic is thus tied up. The Long Island sound service\r\nof the New Haven system, the Old Dominion Company, jointly owned by\r\neastern railroads, and the Morgan Line and Pacific Mail Company, both\r\nparts of the Southern Pacific system, are notable instances. The same\r\nthing is true upon the Great Lakes, where a practical monopoly of\r\neastbound transportation has been long held by the trunk lines. By\r\nrefusal to grant through routes and joint rates to the Lake lines at\r\nBuffalo, these railroads have practically throttled the independent\r\nwater service.[826] Even on the lesser rivers this phenomenon of\r\nneutralization of water competition occurs. Oftentimes where the bulk\r\nof the tonnage, as in transcontinental business, moves by rail, the\r\nwater lines simply follow the railroads as to rates with a modest\r\ndifferential dependent upon circumstances. But the fact of practical\r\nelimination of competition by boat line is well recognized.\r\n\r\nThe concrete shape in which this matter arose in Congress was in\r\nthe form of amendments to the Panama Canal law of 1912. In the\r\nHouse a bill providing for free passage of all American coastwise\r\nvessels was passed by a vote of 206 to 61, this measure at the same\r\ntime prohibiting all railroads from owning stock in or otherwise\r\ncontrolling directly or indirectly, any competing steamship lines. The\r\noverwhelming non-partisan majority is significant of public sentiment\r\non the question. The Senate took a less radical stand in limiting the\r\nprohibition of railroad ownership to vessels making use of the Panama\r\nCanal. After prolonged discussion in the conference committee, the more\r\ndrastic measure was, fortunately, eliminated.\r\n\r\nFrom several points of view absolute prohibition of financial\r\nrelationship between railway and water carriers seems unwise. A\r\npractical objection is that it may seriously handicap American roads\r\nin competition with Canadian carriers. The Grand Trunk, for example,\r\nreaching tidewater on Long Island sound might lawfully operate a\r\nboat line extending its service into New York; whereas the New Haven\r\nRailroad would be forced to dispose of its water lines to the same\r\npoint, because they were in competition with its railroad service.\r\nAnd it is indisputable that similar injustice to American railroads\r\nmight elsewhere be brought about. Moreover, the undoubted evil of\r\nwater competition thus neutralized by railroads, might be remedied\r\nin other ways. One of these, embodied in recommendations of the Port\r\nDirectors of Boston in 1912, opposing the more drastic legislation\r\nabove mentioned, is the prevention of monopoly through public ownership\r\nor control of docks and wharfs. For railway ownership or lease of\r\nthese, as at Philadelphia, San Francisco, Boston and elsewhere, is\r\none of the easiest methods of preventing water competition. The water\r\nlines find it physically impossible to secure suitable terminals.\r\nAnd then, finally, there is always the possibility under the now\r\namplified Interstate Commerce law, of enforcing both reasonable rates\r\nand facilities for through shipments, part rail and part water,\r\nas exemplified in the Flour City case above mentioned. It is not\r\nimprobable that further amplification of the law, as recommended by\r\nthe National Waterways Commission in 1912, may be necessary. Probably,\r\nin the light of bitter Southern Pacific experience, it was wise to\r\nrestrict Panama Canal traffic to water lines not under railroad\r\ncontrol. But any attempt to go farther and absolutely to divorce\r\nrail and water lines without provision, even, for the approval of\r\nthe Interstate Commerce Commission in exceptional cases, might be\r\nproductive of great harm both to the railroads and the public.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat will be the probable effect of the opening of the Panama Canal\r\nupon the railroads of the United States? One must consider the nature\r\nand volume of transcontinental traffic. The most important fact is that\r\nnearly nine-tenths of all transcontinental business at the present time\r\nmoves by rail.[827] The tonnage by vessel west bound either around Cape\r\nHorn or by the Isthmian routes has, to be sure, doubled within five\r\nyears to 1911. But by far the larger proportion of the business moves\r\nby railroad direct. Secondly, it is important to note that a large part\r\nof transcontinental traffic consists of an exchange of commodities\r\nbetween the Middle West and the Pacific coast. Over one-half of the\r\nrail shipments west bound to Pacific terminals comes from west of\r\nChicago. Less than one-quarter of the through traffic of one of the\r\nprincipal transcontinental roads originated at Atlantic coast points.\r\nAnd, inasmuch as water competition is still mainly confined to eastern\r\nseaboard territory, the diversion of this middle western business from\r\nthe rail routes will not be disastrous in amount. In the opposite\r\ndirection probably an even higher proportion of business is carried\r\nby rail, the principal reason being that much of the bulky freight of\r\nthe Pacific slope,--lumber for example,--is consumed throughout the\r\ntreeless Mississippi valley. None of this traffic naturally ever moves\r\nby water. It is apparent, therefore, that the effect of opening the\r\nPanama Canal, although great, will be for the most part localized as to\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nSpecifically stated, four distinct changes seem likely to be brought\r\nabout in the transcontinental situation. The first will probably be\r\na considerable stimulation to the merchants and cities along the\r\nAtlantic seaboard throughout a zone extending inland, perhaps, as far\r\nas Cleveland and Pittsburg. A substantial drop in steamship rates will\r\nbe followed, of course, by a corresponding reduction in through rates\r\nto the Pacific coast. But, on the other hand, it must be borne in mind\r\nthat at best this tonnage is even today relatively unimportant to the\r\ntranscontinental railroads. More than two-thirds of their through\r\ntraffic, as we have just seen, now comes from the Middle West. These\r\nrailways will probably prefer to lose a portion of this Atlantic\r\nseaboard business rather than to reduce their rates upon perhaps\r\nfour-fifths of the other traffic, as they would otherwise have to do\r\nunder the present system of postage stamp rates, from the Atlantic\r\nseaboard to the west of the Missouri river.[828] The eastern trunk\r\nlines, moreover, may probably be relied upon to extend the low seaboard\r\nrates somewhat farther inland than at present, rather than to divide\r\nlow or even lower through all-rail rates from the Atlantic to the\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\nNext to the Atlantic seaboard territory, the so-called Intermountain or\r\nRocky mountain region, may be expected to benefit substantially from\r\nthe opening of the canal. It will surely get lower direct rates than\r\nat present on all its supplies from the East. Atlantic seaboard cities\r\nwill doubtless also seek to regain some of the business throughout\r\nthis region, which has been lost to them because of the growth of\r\nmanufactures in the Middle West. The transcontinental railroads will\r\nseek to protect their clients in St. Louis and Chicago as against the\r\nmerchants in New York and Boston, who gain an entrance to Denver and\r\nSpokane through the backdoor, so to say. Not only will lower rates\r\nprevail, therefore, but there will also probably be a larger proportion\r\nof supplies for these mountain states drawn directly from the eastern\r\nseaboard.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing prognostication, at first glance, seems to indicate\r\nthat the Middle West is likely to profit less by the opening of\r\nthis great waterway than other parts of the country. But it should\r\nbe borne in mind that their hold upon west coast trade is now most\r\nfirmly established. A part, but certainly only a part, of Pacific\r\nterminal business may be lost, but this will be more than offset by\r\nthe growth of intercourse with the intermountain states. Surely the\r\ntranscontinental railroads west from St. Paul, Chicago, and St. Louis\r\nmay be relied upon to protect the direct exchange of goods of their\r\nconstituents with the intermountain communities. Transcontinental\r\nrailway rates will, of course, be lowered somewhat. The railways\r\nwill, however, probably prefer to surrender the lesser portion of\r\ntheir present traffic in order to maintain profitable charges upon\r\nthe major share of their tonnage. The profit of these railways will\r\ndoubtless for the moment be lessened; but there can be little question\r\nthat an enhancement of their prosperity will follow in the long run.\r\nThe opening of this great new avenue of commerce by sea is bound to\r\nstimulate immensely the growth and prosperity of the entire country.\r\nAnd it is beyond question that in any such large development in future,\r\nthey will all share to a large degree.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[798] On state commissions and the conflict with the Federal\r\ngovernment, consult as follows:\r\n\r\n1900.
