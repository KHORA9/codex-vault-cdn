S. A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nBY JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nA prolonged illness, added to other causes, has disappointed my hope of\r\ncompleting an elaborate biography of my father.\r\n\r\nThis memoir by Mr. Tuckerman is devoted chiefly to the part borne by\r\nJudge Jay in the antislavery work, to which his time and thoughts were\r\nso long given. In this connection the memoir develops his personal\r\ncharacteristics, with the constitutional principles and national policy\r\nadvocated by him in that historic contest; while of necessity it touches\r\nbut lightly on his home life, his varied correspondence, and his\r\njudicial charges, one of which assisted to avert the passage of a\r\npro-slavery legislative act infringing the liberty of speech and of the\r\npress; and the scope of the volume forbids its dwelling on his writings\r\non other topics, some of which are still subjects of discussion.\r\n\r\nJudge Jay's memoir on the formation of a National Bible Society, which\r\nin 1816 so warmly encouraged the hopes of the venerable Boudinot, was\r\nfollowed by spirited controversial pamphlets with an antagonist as able\r\nand eminent as Bishop Hobart. The correspondence after Jay's first\r\nletter was marked by an unusual sharpness, which happily did not prevent\r\nmy cherished and lamented friend, the son and namesake of the Bishop,\r\nfrom becoming in later years sincerely attached to his father's\r\nantagonist. It was a contest in which Jay vindicated the right of\r\nChurchmen to assist in the distribution of the Bible, and anticipated in\r\nthis his similar efforts for a lifetime to secure the united action of\r\nall good citizens, without regard to creed or politics, in practicable\r\nschemes for the elevation and happiness of mankind. Among his earlier\r\nessays were two on \"Sunday: Its Value as a Civil Institution, and Its\r\nSacred Character\"; while a third, upon \"Duelling as a Relic of\r\nBarbarism,\" was honoured, when the authorship was still unknown, by a\r\nmedal from an anti-duelling association at Savannah.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nJudge Jay, in the life of his father, which was welcomed as an important\r\naddition to our American biography of the Revolution, vindicated, by a\r\ncareful presentation of the historical evidence then available, the\r\nsoundness of the judgment of Jay and Adams, as peace commissioners at\r\nParis in 1782-83, regarding the policy of the French court as unfriendly\r\nto the American claims to the boundaries, the fisheries, and the\r\nMississippi. That judgment, afterwards acquiesced in by Dr. Franklin in\r\nthe joint violation by the commissioners of the instructions of\r\nCongress--a violation that enabled them to obtain from England\r\nboundaries and concessions far greater than either Congress or France\r\nexpected--had been roughly criticised and denied, even in volumes of\r\ndiplomatic correspondence claiming an official sanction. Its vindication\r\nby Judge Jay has recently been more than confirmed by the ample proofs\r\npublished by M. de Circourt in the secret correspondence of the Count de\r\nVergennes with his able corps of diplomatic agents, as well as by the\r\ninteresting revelations in Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice's \"Life of Lord\r\nShelburne\"; and these volumes have dissipated a cloud of error which for\r\nhalf a century travestied the facts and dimmed the glory of the closing\r\nact of the American Revolution.[A]\r\n\r\n\r\nJAY'S \"WAR AND PEACE,\" AND INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION.\r\n\r\nJudge Jay's little book on \"War and Peace,\" with a plan of stipulation\r\nby treaty for international arbitration which subsequently led to his\r\nbecoming the president of the American Peace Society, and which before\r\nits publication attracted the attention of that sturdy advocate for\r\npeace, Joseph Sturge, during his visit at Bedford, seems entitled to\r\nspecial notice as one whose scheme is still agitated in the governmental\r\nand national councils of Europe. The plan promptly received the approval\r\nof the Peace Society of London, and of English statesmen like Richard\r\nCobden and the indefatigable Henry Richard. It exercised a European\r\ninfluence in the highest quarters when its spirit, under the leadership\r\nof Lord Clarendon, received the sanction of the great powers of Europe\r\nwho signed the Treaty at Paris in 1856. Its endorsement, while\r\ncautiously expressed, was recognized as having a new and profound\r\nsignificance. The Protocol No. 23 declared the wish of the signatory\r\ngovernments that states between which any serious misunderstanding might\r\narise should, before appealing to arms, have recourse, as far as\r\ncircumstances might allow, to the good offices of a friendly power; it\r\nbeing understood that the wish expressed by Congress should not in any\r\ncase oppose limits to that liberty of appreciation which no power could\r\nalienate in questions that touched its dignity. With that limitation the\r\nrecommendation, in advance of a resort to war to have recourse to a\r\nfriendly power, was introduced by the Congress to the International Code\r\nof Europe; and among those great diplomatists were the Count Walewski\r\nand Baron Bourgueny, on the part of France; Count de Buol-Schauenstein\r\nand Baron de Hubner, on the part of Austria; Lord Clarendon and Lord\r\nCowley, on the part of Great Britain; Count Orloff and Baron de Bruno,\r\non the part of Russia; and Count Cavour and the Marquis de Villamarina,\r\non the part of Sardinia. The action of the Congress was subsequently\r\nconfirmed by that of the lesser states of Europe. Mr. Gladstone\r\npronounced the protocol \"a very great triumph, a powerful engine in\r\nbehalf of civilized humanity.\" The late Earl of Derby referred to it as\r\n\"the principle which to its immortal honour was embodied in the\r\nprotocols of the Conference at Paris\"; and the Earl of Malmesbury\r\npronounced the act \"one important to civilization and to the security of\r\nthe peace of Europe.\" The idea that this scheme is more and more\r\nregarded as widely applicable to international disputes, as easily\r\npracticable and profoundly important to the peace of nations, would seem\r\nprobable from the extent to which, as the century approaches its\r\ncompletion, the scheme has occupied more and more the attention of both\r\nthe statesmen and of the masses who are the most interested in\r\ndiscovering a substitute for war.\r\n\r\nFor a time after the Geneva award, the moral weight and value of\r\ninternational arbitration seemed to be more doubted than ever. It was\r\nsaid that while the scheme had in that case avoided war, it had\r\nsuggested the probability of claims so extravagant and inadmissible as\r\nalmost to force the opposing party to break the treaty under the cover\r\nof which they were advanced, even at the risk of increased hostility and\r\na resort to war; and that the escape of both nations from such a\r\ncatastrophe by the action of the Genevan Court in dismissing without\r\nargument the American claims for indirect damages was but a happy\r\naccident. But this idea seems to have been succeeded by the happier\r\nthought that an appeal to international arbitration is an appeal to the\r\nfairness of the world, and that the question for the parties, judges,\r\nand spectators is so clearly one of honour, that no nation can afford to\r\nask what the justice of the world candidly disapproves. In the case of\r\nthe Geneva Congress, while the rejected claims were presented in the\r\nname of the President, General Grant himself subsequently denied their\r\njustice and approved their rejection. Sir Lyon (now Lord) Playfair, who\r\nperhaps appreciates the entire subject of arbitration as thoroughly as\r\nany living statesman, gave an interesting sketch of its recent progress,\r\nboth in Europe and America, in a paper entitled, \"A Topic for\r\nChristmas,\" in the _North American Review_ for December, 1890. Three\r\nyears before, Sir Lyon had headed a deputation of members of the English\r\nParliament who came to present to the President of the United States a\r\nmemorial from 234 members of the House of Commons, with delegates from\r\nEnglish Trades Unions representing 700,000 workingmen. Congress in\r\nresponse concurrently resolved to invite from time to time, as fit\r\noccasion might arise, negotiations with any government with which the\r\nUnited States has or may have diplomatic relations, to the end that any\r\ndifferences or disputes arising between the two governments which cannot\r\nbe settled by diplomatic agency may be referred to arbitration and be\r\npeacefully adjusted by such means. Although Europe is supposed by many\r\nto be awaiting a war of gigantic magnitude, Sir Lyon, referring to the\r\napproval of arbitration by the Pan-American Congress by continental\r\nparliaments and international assemblies at Paris and London, said that\r\nthe legislatures which had already passed resolutions in favor of\r\narbitration represented 150,000,000 of people, and remarked that the\r\nextension of that feeling would be a better force than an international\r\npolice to secure the observance of treaties. The excess of war\r\npreparation already endangering national credit and threatening national\r\nbankruptcy is quoted as proving that the arbitration idea will be\r\ninsisted upon, and in the anticipated movement the United States is\r\ndescribed as fitted to be the leading champion of arbitration. Sheridan\r\nis quoted among others as saying: \"I mean what I say when I express the\r\nbelief that arbitration will rule the world.\" The scheme is now\r\nrepresented as likely to be accepted by thinkers who reject the thought\r\nof Kant, Bentham, and Mills for an international Congress; and Sir Lyon\r\nPlayfair, in connection with the idea of arbitration, quotes the remark\r\nof Mazzini that \"thought is the action of men and action the thought of\r\nthe people.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"THE WAR WITH MEXICO,\" AND ANTISLAVERY PAPERS.\r\n\r\nThe \"Review of the War with Mexico\" stands among Judge Jay's volumes\r\nunexcelled by exactness of congressional, diplomatic, and, to some\r\nextent, military research; and by plainness of speech in regard to\r\nnational outrages and perfidy without a name, perpetrated in the cause\r\nof slavery; and his writings generally on this subject show the same\r\naccurate inquiry and outspoken frankness. It was on the varied phases\r\nof our treatment of the coloured people, free and slave, at our own\r\ndoors, the cruel wrong so full of injustice to the blacks, of scandal to\r\nChristendom, and of menace to the republic, that Jay wrote with deepest\r\nearnestness, the most exacting research, and a fearless pen. His inquiry\r\ninto \"The American Colonization and the Antislavery Societies\" and \"The\r\nAction of the Federal Government in Behalf of Slavery,\" developed facts\r\nwhich implicated prominent politicians of both parties, and aroused at\r\nonce their surprise and indignation, while the disclosure directly\r\nappealed to the pride and conscience of the American people. The same\r\njudicial, dauntless, and defiant spirit marked the appeals which he\r\nprepared for the Antislavery Society against the calumnies of the press,\r\nand the dignified protest against the libellous charges so unworthily\r\nmade by President Jackson in his message to Congress. The same spirit\r\nanimated his address on \"The Condition of the People of Colour in the\r\nUnited States\"; the \"Appeal to the Friends of Constitutional Liberty, on\r\nthe Violation by the House of Representatives of the Right of Petition\";\r\nhis supplement to \"The Reproof of the American Church,\" by Bishop\r\nWilberforce of Oxford; the exposure in the letter to Bishop Ives of the\r\nclerical efforts to sanctify slavery and caste; and his earnest demand\r\nfor the equal admission of the coloured churches to the Diocesan Council\r\nof New York. So, too, with the critical analysis of Mr. Clay's\r\n\"Compromise Bill,\" including the Fugitive Law and Mr. Webster's \"Theory\r\nof Physical Geography\"; his address to the inhabitants of New Mexico and\r\nCalifornia, so timely distributed in English and Spanish, and so happily\r\nfollowed in California by a free constitution, urging them to resist the\r\ndomination of slavery with its ignorance and degradation, and to secure,\r\nby their own manly independence and just statesmanship, a glorious\r\nfuture of power and happiness; his address to the antislavery\r\nChristians; and his plain reminders to the Protestant Episcopal Church,\r\nand to the Tract and other societies, of the inconsistency and evil\r\ninfluence of their compromising pro-slavery policy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES--AN HISTORIC PARALLEL.\r\n\r\nThe part of Jay's life pictured by Mr. Tuckerman not only exhibits these\r\ncharacteristics, but shows the Antislavery Society to have been founded\r\nby his care, in 1833, on constitutional principles so just and so\r\nclearly defined, that in 1839 sixteen hundred and fifty auxiliary\r\nsocieties had been established on the same basis, educating the rising\r\ngeneration, on whom was to rest the destiny of the country in the near\r\nfuture. It was an education of the quiet and effective influence of\r\nwhich the pro-slavery leaders seemed unconscious, although to some it\r\nmay recall the thought of Dr. Storrs, when he said:--\"When I think of a\r\nmillennium in our time, in our civilization, my thought rests and\r\nfastens on the promise, 'a little child shall lead them.'\" The charge\r\nhad already been made against the opponents of slavery of a disregard\r\nof constitutional obligations--of a desire to dissolve the Union and to\r\nencourage slave insurrection. The society declared the exclusive right\r\nof each slave State to legislate in regard to slavery; the\r\nconstitutional right of Congress to abolish slavery in the District of\r\nColumbia, to prohibit it in the Territories and new States, and to\r\ncontrol the domestic as well as the foreign slave trade; and it\r\ndisclaimed the idea of countenancing the slaves in vindicating their\r\nrights by resorting to physical force. And here is suggested, by the\r\naction and the anticipation of the Slave Power, an interesting historic\r\nparallel. The formation of the Antislavery Society in December, 1833,\r\nfollowed closely upon Mr. Calhoun's Nullification in South Carolina in\r\n1832, when, as Mr. Pollard tell us, a medal was struck inscribed, \"John\r\nC. Calhoun, First President of the C. S. A.\" A counterpart of this medal\r\nin gold is said to exist at Richmond, with the name of Jefferson Davis\r\nas the first president of the Southern Confederacy, and \"1861\" on the\r\nreverse side.\r\n\r\nThese incidents seem to emphasize the fact that the constitutional\r\nprinciples adopted by the Antislavery Society in 1833, and so widely\r\ncirculated by the press and its auxiliaries before the war, although\r\noften assailed, were, in 1854, made the basis of the Republican party,\r\nwhich, as Americans of all sections may now with mutual regard and\r\naffection thank God, maintained the Union and abolished slavery. Such a\r\nrevolution in public opinion is a forcible reminder of the truth that\r\nevery principle contains within itself the germ of a prophecy, and it is\r\na thought fraught with hope and confidence to reformers even when they\r\nseem to be threatened with disaster and defeat.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY SCHEME FOR A SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY.\r\n\r\nThe determination to found a confederacy with slavery as its cornerstone\r\nappears as a fundamental feature in the policy of the Slave Power for\r\nsome thirty years before the outbreak of the Civil War. Mr. Calhoun's\r\nidea of secession, apparently suggested by the tariff, General Jackson\r\npredicted would be renewed on the question of slavery. The novel of\r\nProf. Beverly Tucker in 1835, entitled, \"The Partisan Leader; or, Twenty\r\nYears After,\" foreshadowed the steps at home and abroad which were taken\r\nin forming the new confederacy; and in the South Carolina Convention in\r\n1860, Southern politicians like Rhett, Parker, Keith, and Inglis said\r\nthat the matter had nothing to do with Mr. Lincoln or the Fugitive Law,\r\nbut had been culminating for a long series of years. The thought of a\r\nSouthern Confederacy may have stimulated the policy of using the power\r\nof the Republic, while it lasted, in the interest of the Confederacy\r\nthat was to succeed it; supplying a motive for the Texan Rebellion, the\r\nWar with Mexico, the effort to secure Cuba, the filibustering\r\nexpeditions to Central America, the determination to reopen the African\r\nslave-trade, and the pro-slavery action of the Buchanan administration.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTHERN AND EUROPEAN SYMPATHY WITH SLAVERY.\r\n\r\nIt would be hardly fair to the Southern leaders to assume that they\r\nfound no reason for their hope of effecting the dissolution of the Union\r\nin the sympathy and aid promised from the North and from Europe. The\r\nsecret conferences with Lord Lyons of Northern sympathizers with slavery\r\nwere disclosed by the despatches of that eminent diplomatist. Mayor\r\nFernando Wood's proposition that New York should become a free city,\r\nindependent both of the States and the nation, showed in no slight\r\ndegree the temper of the citizens whom he represented; while the later\r\nappeal of so eminent and popular a leader as Governor Horatio Seymour to\r\nthe citizens of the State was equally significant when he said, \"In the\r\ndownfall of the nation, and amid its crumbling ruins, we will cling to\r\nthe fortunes of New York.\" Such utterances enforced by leaders of the\r\nprominence of Franklin Pierce and Vallandingham; the political action of\r\nsympathizers with slavery and the anti-draft riots in New York,\r\nsupplemented by the unfriendliness of European governments; and the\r\nescape of the \"Alabama\"--all these circumstances tended to encourage the\r\nhopes that were doomed to disappointment. Nor in considering the\r\nantislavery movement should we overlook the effect of the antislavery\r\nopinion of our country in ending the danger of European intervention,\r\nwhich had been unwittingly encouraged by Mr. Seward's too hasty\r\nassurance to our minister in France (April 22, 1861), that \"the\r\nrevolution was without a cause, without a pretext, and without an\r\nobject; and that the condition of slavery in the several States would\r\nremain just the same, whether it should succeed or fail.\" The\r\nantislavery policy, first of enlistment and then of emancipation, so\r\nearnestly urged upon Mr. Lincoln and adopted by him with conscientious\r\ncaution, enlightened Europe as to the true meaning of the contest in our\r\nrecognition of the equal right to freedom and the equal dignity of\r\nlabour, and forbade its rulers to assist in the establishment of a slave\r\nconfederacy; and the historian Lessing, when alluding to the cordial\r\nreception by his holiness the Sovereign Pontiff of the diplomatic agents\r\nof Mr. Jefferson Davis, and the Papal letter recognizing and commending\r\n\"the illustrious President of the Southern Confederacy,\" remarks that\r\nthis was \"the only official recognition of the chief conspirator by the\r\nhead of any government.\" Nor should the right appreciation by the\r\nabolitionists of the prospect of freedom for the slaves be forgotten.\r\nThe fidelity of the negroes during the war, both to the families with\r\nwhom they lived, to which Vice-President Stephens bore distinct\r\ntestimony, and to the Northern army, from which they expected\r\nemancipation, was no less honourable and conspicuous than the devotion\r\nand gallantry they constantly exhibited in the war, as at Fort Hudson\r\nand Fort Wagner, at Milliken's Bend and Lake Providence, at Newbern and\r\nat Olustee, where their rear-guard saved the army. Their conduct,\r\nwhether at home or in the field, justified the conviction of their\r\nsteadfast friends in the safety of immediate emancipation, and added\r\nuntold force to the sacredness of the pledges so often given during the\r\nwar, and still, to the national discredit, unfulfilled--of national aid\r\nto State education, so as to secure to every child of our coloured\r\ncitizens the ability to read his Bible and the Constitution, to fulfill\r\nhis duties and protect his rights.\r\n\r\nAs time and reflection impress upon the American mind a clear\r\ncomprehension of the changes, national, social, and political, that a\r\ntriumph of the Slave Power would have brought to America and its effect\r\nas a set-back to the civilization of the world, an increased interest\r\nwill be felt in the beginnings of the contest, and in the men and causes\r\nthat shaped its end.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LESSON FOR TO-DAY.\r\n\r\nI cordially recommend Mr. Tuckerman's memoir to the students of the\r\nantislavery contest, as throwing light on that interesting and but\r\npartially written chapter of American history, in which my father bore a\r\npart; and on the character and policy of the sturdy band with whom he\r\nwas associated, including Arthur and Lewis Tappan, Joshua Leavitt, James\r\nG. Birney, Gerrit Smith, and their true-hearted compatriots; while a\r\nwider view would include a group of noble women, who, if differing as to\r\nmeans, were united in devotion, headed by the honoured names of Maria\r\nWeston Chapman and Harriet Beecher Stowe, Lucretia Mott, Lydia Maria\r\nChild, and the sisters Grimke.\r\n\r\nAmong our citizens who will be long remembered as early and fearless\r\nopponents of slavery, leading and acting with energy and independence,\r\naccording to their personal convictions and occasionally in differing\r\nways, were the venerable Isaac T. Hopper, William Lloyd Garrison, whose\r\nlife has been so faithfully recorded by his sons, John Greenleaf\r\nWhittier, whose old Huguenot spirit lives in his verse as in his name,\r\nEllis Gray Loring, Lovejoy, the martyr of the west, Wendell Phillips,\r\nwith his matchless eloquence, Theodore D. Weld, with his trenchant pen,\r\nElizur Wright, Jr., Samuel R. Ward, William Goodell, S. S. Jocelyn,\r\nGamaliel Bailey, Jr., Edmund Quincey, S. H. Gay, Oliver Johnston, James\r\nS. Gibbons, and others, who opened the way--sometimes by devious and\r\ndiverging paths--for the party of the Union and Emancipation.\r\n\r\nAs the contest advanced from the field of politics to that of war, came\r\nUnion men from different points whose names will live in our history\r\nwith those of John A. Andrew, John C. Fremont, John P. Hale, Chase,\r\nSumner, Seward, Preston and John A. King, Wilmot, Giddings, Wade, Holt,\r\nand Edwin D. Stanton. In New York, where mob law had prevailed, the\r\nUnion League Club upheld the loyalty of the city, the credit of the\r\nnation, and the sanitary commission; raised troops for Hancock in\r\naddition to its own coloured regiments; stimulated the ardour of our\r\nsoldiers and the patriotism of the country; welcomed, of the army, Grant\r\nand Sherman, Mead and Sheridan, Hancock and Hooker, Warren and Burnside,\r\nand of the navy, Farragut, Dupont and Rogers, Winslow and the youthful\r\nCushing; verifying in its spirit and action the remark of Vice-President\r\nColfax that on the Union League Club Lincoln had leaned in the darkest\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nThe Club did not forget, neither will the truthful historian forget,\r\nthat amid the European plots and intrigues in the interest of slavery,\r\nwe had friends high and low, from Alexander of Russia, the emancipator\r\nof twenty millions of serfs--who, like Lincoln, fell by\r\nassassination--to the humble peasants, who instinctively recognised the\r\nhostility to the rights of labor inherent in the slavery system, whose\r\nvicious features had been exposed by John Bright with such masterly\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nGoldwin Smith, the historic scholar of Oxford, who at home had denounced\r\nthose who would have made England an accomplice in \"the creation of a\r\ngreat slave empire, and in its future extension from the grave of\r\nWashington to the Halls of Montezuma,\" in his reply to the greetings of\r\nthe eminent citizens who had asked him to the club and who assembled to\r\nmeet him,[B] said, \"Your cause is ours; it is the cause of the whole\r\nhuman race.\" The same idea, in almost the same words, was expressed by\r\nthe Count de Cavour a few days before his death, in a despatch to the\r\nItalian Minister at Washington, when he said \"that ours was the cause\r\nnot only of constitutional liberty, but of all humanity.\"\r\n\r\nThe antislavery story from the Calhoun medal, struck to commemorate the\r\nsupposed birth of a slave empire to the constitutional abolition of\r\nslavery, concerned humanity, and has lessons of warning and\r\nencouragement for the men and women of to-day, on whom rest the hopes of\r\nthe country, and who, against odds that seem as formidable as those\r\npresented by the Slave Power at its culmination, are bravely striving\r\nfor the advance of humanity, the purification of our politics, and the\r\npreservation of American institutions. They may well adopt the\r\ninspiriting legend of Geneva to which the antislavery contest of America\r\nhas given a new radiance, \"Post tenebras lux.\" Our institutions, no\r\nlonger endangered by slavery, are assailed with skilful intrigue in\r\ntheir own strongholds, the public school and the polls, especially of\r\nour great cities, where a corrupt, irresponsible, secret rule recalls\r\nthe Council of Ten and the Lion of Saint Mark, and now it is charged\r\nthat our very legislation at times is not simply partisan but\r\nfraudulent. The incompatibility of such proceedings with American\r\nprinciples and American rights recalls with emphatic force the warning\r\nso distinctly and repeatedly given us by Dr. Orestes A. Brownson, that\r\neminent and philosophic representative of our citizens of the Roman\r\nCatholic faith who stand squarely by the American constitution and\r\nAmerican institutions, of the danger of allowing foreigners to meddle\r\nwith our public schools when he said that American civilization was \"the\r\nfarthest point in advance yet reached by any age or nation, and that\r\nforeigners who come to educate according to their civilization\r\nnecessarily educate for a civilization behind the times and below that\r\nof this country.\"\r\n\r\nThe enlightening effect of an impartial study of the antislavery contest\r\non an independent and philosophic critic can be read in the interesting\r\nand instructive pages of Von Holst; and a review of that contest, from\r\nthe first presentment of the principles of the Antislavery Society to\r\nthe parting scene of Grant and Lee at Appomatox, and the adoption of the\r\nconstitutional amendment of emancipation, affords, step by step, amid\r\nwhatever mistakes and blunders, evidence which becomes the more striking\r\nand conclusive, as time passes, of what was accomplished in the\r\nantislavery struggle for humanity and the world in shaping the future of\r\nthe Republic, by calm resolve, a faithful adhesion to truth and\r\nprinciple, patient perseverance, unflinching courage, faith in the\r\ntriumph of right, American manliness, and far-sighted Christian\r\nstatesmanship.\r\n\r\n  BEDFORD HOUSE, Katonah,\r\n    New York, May, 1893.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\nBirth and Education of William Jay.--His Early Philanthropic\r\n  Interests.--Appointed Judge of Westchester County.                   1\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nEarly Opposition to Slavery.--Growth of the Slave Power.--The\r\n  Missouri Compromise.--Jay begins Political Agitation for the\r\n  Abolition of Slavery in the District of Columbia.                   18\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nDevelopment of the Antislavery Movement.--Organization of\r\n  Antislavery Societies.--Anti-Abolition Riots.--Jay publishes his\r\n  \"Inquiry.\"                                                          39\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nContinued Efforts to suppress the Antislavery Movement by Force and\r\n  Intimidation.--Favourable Effect upon the Public Mind produced by\r\n  Jay's Writings.                                                     63\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nGradual Decline of Riotous Demonstrations against the\r\n  Abolitionists.--Changes occur in the Doctrines and Methods of the\r\n  American Antislavery Society.--Judge Jay resigns his Membership,\r\n  while continuing his Efforts on Behalf of Emancipation.             82\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nJudge Jay continues to support the Antislavery Cause by his Advice\r\n  and Writings.--In Consequence of his Opinions he is deprived of his\r\n  Seat on the Bench.--His Visit to Europe.--His Views on the Liberty\r\n  Party.--On the Annexation of Texas.--His \"Review of the Mexican\r\n  War.\"--His Advocacy of International Arbitration as a Remedy for\r\n  War.--His Work in the Episcopal Church.                            112\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nUnpopularity of the Abolitionists.--The Compromises of 1850 and the\r\n  Fugitive-Slave Law.--Jay's Reply to Webster's 7th of March\r\n  Speech.--The Attitude of the Episcopal Church.--The Abrogation of\r\n  the Missouri Compromise.--Disunion.                                135\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nDeath of Judge Jay.--His Position among Antislavery Men.--His other\r\n  Public and Philanthropic Interests.--His Private Life.--His\r\n  Character.                                                         156\r\n\r\nBibliography                                                         171\r\n\r\nIndex                                                                175\r\n\r\nAppendix                                                             184\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Jay, from a crayon by Martin                     _Frontispiece._\r\n\r\nView of Bedford House, the home of Judge Jay                           9\r\n\r\nChief-Justice Jay, from a painting by Gilbert Stuart                  39\r\n\r\nWilliam Jay, from a painting by Vanderlyn                             81\r\n\r\nWilliam Jay, from a painting by Wenzler                              135\r\n\r\nMrs. William Jay, from a painting by W.

New York was then the seat of\r\nthe Federal Government, and the year is memorable as that in which the\r\nNational Constitution superseded the Articles of Confederation, while\r\nthe inauguration of Washington marked a new era in American history.\r\n\r\nDuring the absence of John Jay in England, while negotiating the \"Jay\r\ntreaty,\" he was elected Governor of New York, and returned home to\r\nassume that office in 1795.\r\n\r\nWilliam, then eight years old, was placed at school with the Rev. Thomas\r\nEllison, the rector of St. Peter's Church, Albany. There he received an\r\nold-fashioned training. In 1801 he wrote to his father: \"Mr. Ellison\r\nput me in Virgil, and I can now say the first two eclogues by heart, and\r\nconstrue and parse and scan them.\" And later on: \"I learn nothing but\r\nLatin.\" Among his schoolmates was J. Fenimore Cooper, who afterwards\r\ndrew a portrait of their old instructor in one of his \"Sketches of\r\nEngland,\" addressed to Jay:\r\n\r\n\"Thirty-six years ago you and I were schoolfellows and classmates in the\r\nhouse of a clergyman of the true English school. This man was an epitome\r\nof the national prejudices and in some respects of the national\r\ncharacter. He was the son of a beneficed clergyman in England, had been\r\nregularly graduated at Oxford and admitted to orders; entertained a most\r\nprofound reverence for the King and the nobility; was not backward in\r\nexpressing his contempt for all classes of dissenters and all\r\nungentlemanly sects; was particularly severe on the immoralities of the\r\nFrench Revolution, and though eating our bread, was not especially\r\nlenient to our own; compelled you and me to begin Virgil with the\r\neclogues, and Cicero with the knotty phrase that opens the oration in\r\nfavour of the poet Archias, 'because these writers would not have placed\r\nthem first in the books if they did not intend people to read them\r\nfirst'; spent his money freely and sometimes that of other people; was\r\nparticularly tenacious of the ritual and of all the decencies of the\r\nChurch; detested a democrat as he did the devil; cracked his jokes daily\r\nabout Mr. Jefferson, never failing to place his libertinism in strong\r\nrelief against the approved morals of George III., of several passages\r\nin whose history it is charitable to suppose he was ignorant; prayed\r\nfervently on Sunday, and decried all morals, institutions, churches,\r\nmanners, and laws but those of England from Monday to Saturday.\"\r\n\r\nStill, Jay and Cooper were indebted to Ellison's thoroughness in the\r\nclassics for much of the mental training, the correct taste, and the\r\npure English which marked their subsequent intellectual efforts.\r\n\r\nJay was prepared for college by Henry Davis, afterwards president of\r\nHamilton College. The boy as he appeared at this time was thus described\r\nby his cousin, Susan Sedgwick: \"As I look back to that fresh spring-time\r\nof life, there rises clearly before me a vigorous, sturdy boy, full of\r\nhealth and animation, with laughing eyes, cheeks glowing and dimpled,\r\nand exhibiting already marked traits: with a strong will, yet easily\r\nreduced by rightful authority; in temper quick, even to passion, but\r\nnever vindictive; the storm easily raised as soon appeased, thus\r\nforeshadowing him at that later period, when, however capable of\r\nself-control, his fearless resistance to wrong and uncompromising\r\nadvocacy of right partook of the same vehement character, happily\r\nexpressed by his friend, Mr. Fenimore Cooper, who, in reference to his\r\nthen recently published denunciation of the evils of war, addressed him\r\nplayfully, 'Thou most pugnacious man of peace.'\"\r\n\r\nWilliam entered Yale College in January, 1804, in his fifteenth year.\r\nUpon the college roll during his four years were names afterwards well\r\nknown in our history. There were trained side by side boys who were soon\r\nto be arrayed against each other in religion, politics, and in the\r\nmomentous conflict of slavery with freedom, which, passing from the\r\nsenate to the field, their sons and grandsons were to terminate by the\r\nsword. From the State of South Carolina came John C. Calhoun, who\r\nsignificantly chose for the subject of his graduating oration, \"The\r\nQualifications Necessary for a Perfect Statesman;\" Christopher Edward\r\nGadsden, afterwards bishop of his native State; and Thomas Smith Grimke,\r\neminent at the bar, in scholarship and philanthropy. Among the Northern\r\nstudents was the Rev. John Pierpont, known as the reformer and poet, who\r\nat the age of seventy-six went to the front during the Civil War as\r\nchaplain of a Massachusetts regiment; Hon. Henry Randolph Storrs, of New\r\nYork, the jurist; Rev. Dr. Nathaniel William Taylor, of the Calvinistic\r\nschool of Edwards and Dwight; Dr. Thomas H. Gallaudet, of Huguenot\r\ndescent, who devoted himself to the education of deaf-mutes; Dr.\r\nAlexander H. Stevens, of New York; Rev. Dr. Samuel Farmer Jarvis, the\r\nlearned professor of oriental literature; Rev. Dr. Gardiner Spring, of\r\nNew York, the famous Presbyterian divine; the Hon. William Huntington,\r\nof Connecticut; Jacob Sutherland, of New York; and James A. Hillhouse,\r\nof New Haven, one of the most scholarly of our poets, whose generous\r\nhospitality at his beautiful home, Sachem's Wood, with its avenue of\r\nstately elms planted by his father and himself, was for many years the\r\ndelight of his friends. At Yale Jay met Cooper again, and strengthened a\r\nfriendship which lasted through life. It was during a visit at Bedford,\r\nabout 1825, while sitting on the piazza with Chief-Justice Jay, smoking\r\nand talking of the incidents of the Revolution, that Fenimore Cooper\r\nlearned the adventures of a patriotic American, who was apparently\r\nattached to the royal cause, but who constantly warned of danger the\r\nContinental Army in Westchester and was especially useful during the\r\nsitting of the State convention at White Plains. The services and\r\nescapes of this man were reproduced in \"Harvey Birch, the Spy of the\r\nNeutral Ground,\" which achieved so great a success at home and in\r\nEurope, where it still holds its place, having been honoured by more\r\ntranslations, including the Persian and Arabic, than any similar work\r\nwritten in English until the appearance of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter to his grandson, William Jay, in 1852, Judge Jay gave some\r\nparticulars of his college course, which show the simplicity of life in\r\nthose days and the still lingering influence of English habits: \"Through\r\nthe influence of a professor with whom I had previously lived, I was\r\nplaced in the room of a resident graduate. The resident graduates were\r\ndenominated 'Sirs'; they had a pew in the chapel called the Sirs' pew;\r\nand when spoken of in college always had Sir prefixed to their names.\r\nMy room-mate was Sir Holly (Dr. Horace Holly). As a mere freshman I\r\nlooked up to my room-mate with great respect and treated him\r\naccordingly. We had no servants to wait on us, except that a man came\r\nevery morning to make our beds and sweep the room, and once a week to\r\nscatter clean white sand on the floor. I rose early--generally before\r\nsix in winter--made the fire, and then went, pitcher in hand, often\r\nwading through snow, for water for Sir Holly and myself. At that time\r\nthe freshmen occupied in part the place of sizers in the English\r\nuniversities, and they were required to run errands for the seniors. Our\r\nmeals were taken in a large hall with a kitchen opening into it. The\r\nstudents were arranged at tables according to their classes. All sat on\r\nwooden benches, not excepting the tutors; the latter had a table to\r\nthemselves on an elevated platform whence they had a view of the whole\r\ncompany. But it was rather difficult for them to attend to their plates\r\nand to watch two hundred boys at the same time. Salt beef once a day and\r\ndry cod were perhaps the most usual dishes. On Sunday mornings during\r\nthe winter our breakfast-tables were graced with large tin milk-cans\r\nfilled with stewed oysters; at the proper season we were occasionally\r\ntreated at dinner with green peas. As you may suppose, a goodly number\r\nof waiters were needed in the hall. These were all students, and many of\r\nthem among the best and most esteemed scholars. About half-past five in\r\nwinter the bell summoned us from our beds, and at six it called us to\r\nprayers in the chapel. We next repaired to the recitation-rooms and\r\nrecited by candle-light the lessons we had studied the preceding\r\nevening. At eight we had breakfast, and at nine the bell warned us to\r\nour rooms. At twelve it called us to a recitation or a lecture. After\r\ndinner we recommenced our studies and recited for the third time at four\r\no'clock. During study hours the tutors would frequently go the rounds,\r\nlooking into our rooms to see that we were not playing truant. Before\r\nsupper, we all attended evening prayers in the chapel.\"\r\n\r\nThe presidency of the college was then occupied by Dr. Timothy Dwight,\r\nwho also gave instruction in _belles-lettres_, oratory, and theology. To\r\nhim Jay wrote in 1818: \"I retain a grateful recollection of your kind\r\nattention to me, and I have, and trust will ever have, reason to\r\nacknowledge the goodness of Providence in placing me under your care,\r\nwhen many of my opinions were to be formed and my principles\r\nestablished.\" Still later, he wrote to a college friend: \"Your remarks\r\non Dr. Dwight are grateful to my heart. I cherish his memory as one of\r\nthe best friends I ever had.\"\r\n\r\nIn his senior year Jay took part in debates among the students, presided\r\nover by Dr. Dwight. Some of the subjects discussed were: \"Ought infidels\r\nto be excluded from office?\" \"Ought religion to be supported by law?\"\r\n\"Would a division of the Union be politic?\" \"Would it be politic to\r\nencourage manufactures in the United States?\" On the last question Dr.\r\nDwight remarked: \"We shall always buy things where we can get them the\r\ncheapest; we will never make our commodities so long as we can buy them\r\nbetter and cheaper elsewhere.\" Jay displayed his natural inclination for\r\nthe law by contributing a series of articles on legal subjects, over the\r\nsignature of \"Coke,\" to the _Literary Cabinet_, the students' paper. He\r\ntook his degree in September, 1807, having injured his eyesight in his\r\nefforts to attain a high standing in his class. \"During the winter of my\r\njunior year,\" he wrote in warning to his grandson William, \"I was\r\nstruggling hard for honours, and trying to make up for lost time; I used\r\nto rise about four o'clock, light my fire, and sit down to the study of\r\nconic sections. I brought on a weakness in my eyes which lasted several\r\nyears. Be sure you never rise before the sun and study your Latin and\r\nGreek by candle-light or gas-light.\"\r\n\r\nAfter graduation Jay went to Albany and began the study of the law in\r\nthe office of John B. Henry. On the 3d of September, 1812, he married\r\nAugusta, daughter of John McVickar, a merchant of New York, and\r\nvestryman of Trinity Church. The difficulty with his eyesight, which had\r\nseriously interfered with his legal studies, became so pronounced as to\r\ncompel him to abandon his profession for some years. During this period\r\nhe retired with his wife to his father's country seat, \"Bedford,\" in\r\nWestchester County, and there devoted himself with energy to\r\nagricultural pursuits. The farm included about eight hundred acres, part\r\nof a tract purchased by Jacobus van Cortlandt from Katonah Sagamore and\r\nother Indian chieftains in 1700, and confirmed by patent of Queen Anne\r\nin 1704. It had come to Chief-Justice Jay partly through his mother,\r\nMary van Cortlandt, the wife of Peter Jay, and partly through her\r\nsister, Eve van Cortlandt, the wife of Judge John Chambers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Jay House at Bedford.]\r\n\r\nOf the forty fields into which the farm was divided, Jay kept a separate\r\naccount: showing the tillage and produce, the drainage and fencing, the\r\ndates of planting and reaping. A volume of this kind, begun in 1816,\r\ncontained entries as late as 1857, the year before his death. He\r\nperfected himself in grafting and budding, and was particularly\r\nsuccessful with peaches, with cherries, pears and plums, some of them\r\nwith Huguenot names and memories, and with muskmelons from Persian seed,\r\nbrought to him from the East by a friend. He raised horses from imported\r\nstock, Merino sheep, and superintended the curing of hams from a\r\nWestphalian recipe, furnished by an old Hessian farm hand--one of the\r\nhirelings who had come to conquer and remained to cultivate the country.\r\nIn 1818 Jay and Fenimore Cooper drafted the constitution for an\r\nagricultural society of which Governor Jay was the first president and\r\nGeneral Pierre van Cortlandt the second--an institution of great use in\r\nthe development of Westchester County.\r\n\r\nIn 1815, when twenty-six years of age, Jay entered upon that course of\r\nactive philanthropy which for the next forty years employed his thoughts\r\nand pen. His first effort was directed to the improvement of his native\r\ntown of Bedford in the organization of the Society for the Suppression\r\nof Vice. By means of this society, of which he was the secretary, he did\r\nmuch to restrain the liquor traffic and to diminish intemperance. Later\r\non, as a judge, he used all the power of the law to the same end; and it\r\nwas he who suggested the law, still in force, which forbids a\r\ntavern-keeper to supply drink on credit.\r\n\r\nAn interesting incident in this early period of his life was the part\r\nwhich he bore in founding the American Bible Society, in organizing its\r\nmachinery for the immense work it had to perform, and in vindicating the\r\nprinciples of the society against the attacks of the opposing party in\r\nhis own church. In this struggle Jay proved the independence of\r\ncharacter and courage of conviction which afterwards distinguished him\r\nthrough the seemingly hopeless years of antislavery effort. The general\r\ndistribution of Bibles in our day makes it difficult to appreciate the\r\nlimited supply, the high cost, and the consequent rarity of the Bible\r\nwhen this society began its work. The High-Church party in New York were\r\nopposed to the association of Episcopalians with other Christians to\r\ncirculate the Bible, and opposed even to the distribution of the Bible,\r\nunless accompanied by the Prayer-book as an interpreter. In these views\r\nthey were vigorously supported by their distinguished leader, Bishop\r\nJohn Henry Hobart. Jay, who had inherited with his Huguenot blood a\r\nfaith in the Bible not to be restrained by ecclesiastical assumption,\r\nwas an officer of the Westchester Bible Society and deeply interested in\r\nthe work. On the appearance of a pastoral letter from Bishop Hobart in\r\nwhich the High-Church views were expressed, he published a pamphlet\r\nshowing that it was \"the interest and duty of Episcopalians to unite\r\nwith their fellow-Christians of all denominations in spreading the\r\nknowledge of the Word of God.\" This pamphlet brought him into an active\r\nconflict with the eminent bishop which lasted for several years, and\r\ntaught him that a philanthropic cause, even so plainly meritorious, was\r\nnot to be carried on without the opposition of powerful conservative\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nConvinced that a national society could accomplish more than the local\r\nand scattered State Bible societies, Jay published a pamphlet in 1816\r\nwhich showed the imperative importance of the work, and urged united\r\naction. At the same time the venerable Elias Boudinot of New Jersey was\r\nexerting himself to the same end. When he received a letter from Jay\r\nenclosing the pamphlet, he thus welcomed his youthful ally: \"These\r\nprecious moments I have devoted to a full consideration of one of the\r\ngreatest and most interesting subjects that has ever concerned the\r\nchildren of men. Weak and feeble and scarcely able to think or write,\r\nmy efforts promised but little in the cause, when your welcome and\r\nunexpected letter was brought in. My drooping spirits were raised and my\r\nmind greatly revived. I could not help giving glory to God for the great\r\nencouragement afforded me to press on in this glorious cause, when I\r\nthus beheld His special mercy in raising up so powerful a support in\r\nthis joyous work and labour of love.\" In the same year the American\r\nBible Society was formed with the assistance of the best names in the\r\ncountry. Elias Boudinot was chosen president, with John Jay and Matthew\r\nClarkson, a gallant officer of the Revolution, as vice-presidents.\r\nOthers on the roll were: John Langdon, the statesman of New Hampshire;\r\nWilliam Gray, the eminent merchant of Boston; the scholarly John Cotton\r\nSmith, of Connecticut, with the blood of the Cottons and the Mathers of\r\ncolonial history; William Tighlman, the jurist of Pennsylvania; William\r\nWirt and Bushrod Washington, of Virginia; Charles Cotesworth Pinckney,\r\nof South Carolina; Governor Worthington, of Ohio; John Bolton, of\r\nGeorgia; Felix Grundy, of Tennessee; and of New York: Dr. John B.\r\nRomeyne; Colonel Richard Varick, Washington's aide; Daniel D. Tompkins,\r\nthe Governor who obtained the abolition of slavery in the State; John\r\nPintard, John Aspinwall, Jeremiah Evarts, Frederic de Peyster, George\r\nGriffin, De Witt Clinton, the Patroon Stephen van Rensselaer, and\r\nColonel Henry Rutgers.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the honourable support given to the society, it had to\r\nresist a carefully organized assault on the part of Bishop Hobart and an\r\ninfluential portion of his clergy aimed at the vital principle on which\r\nthe success of the movement depended--the cordial union of all\r\nChristians. Jay's previous training in the same field of controversy,\r\nhis staunch devotion at once to his cause and to his church, designated\r\nhim as the proper person to carry on, in behalf of the society, the war\r\nof letters and pamphlets which ensued. Although pitted against an\r\nadversary to whom age, experience, and station gave great advantages, he\r\nacquitted himself with credit, displaying literary and reasoning powers\r\nwhich were soon to exert a potent effect upon the great moral issue of\r\nour time.\r\n\r\nOther questions of a philanthropic character occupied his pen. The Synod\r\nof Albany having offered a prize for the best essay on the observance of\r\nthe Sabbath, Jay competed for it with success. A more notable incident\r\nof the same sort occurred in 1828. The Savannah Anti-duelling\r\nAssociation offered a medal for the best argument against duelling. The\r\ncommittee appointed to judge the essays were: John Cummings; James M.\r\nWayne, subsequently appointed by President Jackson a justice of the\r\nSupreme Court; R. W. Habersham, afterwards Governor of Georgia; William\r\nLaw; and Matthew Hall McAllister, mayor of Savannah and an opponent of\r\nNullification in 1832. That in 1828 these Southern men were seeking to\r\nroot out the habit of duelling, and that the prize should have been\r\nawarded by them to William Jay, is a curious commentary on the\r\nconnection between slavery and duelling. At this time both practices had\r\ntheir opponents at the South who were allowed to express their opinions.\r\nAs the grip of slavery increased in strength and closed the mouth of\r\nevery objector, anti-duelling sentiment was simultaneously extinguished.\r\nBoth barbarous practices were to increase and to perish together. Jay's\r\nessay could then find praise among men who a few years later would not\r\ntolerate in their homes any product of his pen.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1818, Jay was appointed one of the judges of Westchester County.\r\nThe mention of the fact in his diary closed with the words, \"May I have\r\ngrace to discharge with fidelity the duties of the station.\" Two years\r\nlater a commission from Governor Clinton made him the first judge of the\r\ncounty, an office which he held until 1823, when the adoption of the new\r\nconstitution terminated all offices under the old one. Fenimore Cooper\r\nthen wrote to him, \"I see that you are unhorsed with other clever\r\nfellows.\" But in response to a general demand, Governor Clinton\r\nreappointed him under the new constitution, and he continued to hold\r\noffice under successive governors of different parties until 1843, when\r\nhe was displaced by Governor Bouck at the demand of the pro-slavery wing\r\nof the democracy. A decision of Jay's, rejecting a witness who declared\r\nhis un-belief in God, occurred when De Tocqueville was in the United\r\nStates, and was commented upon by the distinguished Frenchman as having\r\nbeen accepted by the press without comment, and as showing that the\r\nAmerican people combined the notions of Christianity and of liberty so\r\nintimately that it was impossible to make them conceive of the one\r\nwithout the other, and that they held religion to be indispensable to\r\nthe maintenance of republican institutions. In 1862, soon after Jay's\r\ndeath, when an attempt was made by a pro-slavery faction in the county\r\nto remove his portrait from the court-house at White Plains, it was\r\ndefeated by a protest of the members of the bar. \"Many of us,\" they\r\nsaid, \"were well acquainted with Judge Jay, and can speak from personal\r\nknowledge of those high qualities which have given him an historic\r\ncelebrity. Whilst he entertained and vigorously vindicated decided\r\nopinions on certain questions which have much divided society and\r\nproduced much acrimony of feeling--in which many of us did not\r\nsympathize with him--yet we can all bear testimony to the noble\r\nfrankness and sincerity of his nature, to his deep interest in all\r\nquestions tending to advance the interest of the race, and to the\r\nextraordinary intellectual strength displayed by him on all occasions in\r\ngiving expression to his convictions.\"\r\n\r\nIn the early years of Jay's life, it appears that his mind turned\r\nnaturally toward philanthropic subjects. His moral sense was largely\r\ndeveloped, his conscience active, his humanity aggressive. His own\r\ncomfortable circumstances did not close his heart to the sufferings of\r\nothers. His generous nature longed to replace evil by good. And in the\r\ncause which his conscience approved, no obloquy nor social unpopularity\r\ncould impede his progress. At the same time, there was about him nothing\r\nof the intemperate agitator. He was a judge and brought to his\r\nphilanthropic labours a judicial habit of mind. Indeed, it was this\r\nhabit of mind which distinguished him among his fellow-workers in the\r\nantislavery cause. It was his mission to urge emancipation with the\r\nConstitution in his hand; to meet in conflict that portion of society\r\nwhich silenced its uneasy conscience by a repetition of constitutional\r\nprovisions, and at the same time to combat those who were inclined to\r\nseek emancipation by unconstitutional means.\r\n\r\nHis quiet country life, in which healthful out-of-door pursuits were\r\nmingled with the study and reflection of his library, particularly\r\nfitted him to look at this all-important question with calmness, with\r\nconsideration for both sides, and yet with the vigour of a mind free to\r\nwork exhaustively on a subject involving many conflicting theories and\r\nduties. He brought to his task real talents, literary and polemic; a\r\nstyle ready and concise; a reasoning enlivened by an effective vein of\r\nirony. He had a refined and benevolent countenance, a pleasing manner,\r\na temper even, but easily roused to indignation at the sight of\r\ninjustice. Before considering his first connection with the antislavery\r\nmovement, we may glance at its situation in the early manhood of William\r\nJay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nEARLY OPPOSITION TO SLAVERY.--GROWTH OF THE SLAVE POWER.--THE\r\n  MISSOURI COMPROMISE.--JAY BEGINS POLITICAL AGITATION FOR THE\r\n  ABOLITION OF SLAVERY IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe movement which culminated in the Civil War and the total abolition\r\nof slavery in the United States was first humanitarian, and subsequently\r\npolitical. Philanthropists prepared the way for the statesman and the\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\nThe humanitarian movement had begun before the time of William Jay and\r\nhis fellow-workers. To find its beginnings, we must look back into the\r\ncolonial days of the eighteenth century. There, among the first, was\r\nGeorge Keith, of Pennsylvania, denouncing the system on grounds of both\r\nChristianity and public policy. And Samuel Sewall, Chief-Justice of\r\nMassachusetts, who, in his pamphlet, \"The Selling of Joseph,\" quaintly\r\ntestified to the truth. \"These Ethiopians,\" he said, \"as black as they\r\nare, seeing they are the sons and daughters of the first Adam and the\r\noffspring of God, they ought to be treated with respect agreeable.\"\r\nRalph Sandiford, Benjamin Lay, William Burling, Anthony Benezet, the\r\nHuguenot, were men who spoke as sincerely as later abolitionists and\r\nwhose words were heard. There was John Woolman, of New Jersey, who\r\npointed out \"the dark gloominess overhanging the land, the spirit of\r\nfierceness and love of dominion,\" resulting from this iniquity; and Dr.\r\nSamuel Hopkins, of Newport, R. I., whose eloquent exhortations banished\r\nthe slave trade from a congregation growing rich on its spoils; and Dr.\r\nBenjamin Rush, of Philadelphia, who foretold that \"future ages will be\r\nat a loss which to condemn most, our folly or our guilt in abetting this\r\ndirect violation of nature and religion.\" The legislatures of Virginia,\r\nSouth Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts in turn attempted to\r\nrestrict the slave-trade; but their efforts were annulled in England,\r\nwhere the slave interest, through its champion, Lord Sandwich, forbade\r\nany interference with \"a traffic so beneficial to the nation.\"\r\n\r\nThe colonies had no sooner achieved their independence than they found\r\nthemselves face to face with the great question, and on the threshold of\r\ntheir national life a great change was perceptible in the attitude of\r\nthe people towards slavery. The old seventeenth century idea, that to\r\ndrag a negro from his heathen wilds to labour unrequited in a Christian\r\ncommunity tended to the benefit of his soul, had passed away. The\r\nslave-trade was generally recognized as indefensible. There were men who\r\ndenounced slavery itself as an abominable evil. Even those most\r\ndetermined to maintain the institution took the ground that it was an\r\nunfortunate necessity, but that it must be preserved to avoid greater\r\nevils. In 1787, through the noble efforts of Thomas Jefferson, Timothy\r\nPickering, Rufus King, Nathan Dane, William Grayson, and Richard Henry\r\nLee, Congress passed the great ordinance which forbade slavery to cross\r\nthe Ohio River into the Northwest Territory.\r\n\r\nThe struggle between right and wrong had begun, but the opposing forces\r\nwere very unequal. On one side was humane sentiment; on the other was\r\ndeeply rooted habit, pecuniary interest, the pressure of political\r\nquestions of seemingly overriding importance. Among the great leaders of\r\nthe time there are two whose opinions and practice give an excellent\r\nillustration of the prevailing antislavery feeling: John Jay of New\r\nYork, Patrick Henry of Virginia. There is no disagreement as to the\r\nmoral elevation of John Jay's character. Abroad and at home, officially\r\nand unofficially, he was always the opponent of slavery. Yet Jay\r\npurchased and held men as slaves. To obtain domestic servants otherwise\r\nwas extremely difficult. After his slaves had served him sufficiently\r\nlong and faithfully to return to him what he considered the value of his\r\noutlay, he gave them their freedom. He believed that slavery in\r\nprinciple was wrong, but he yielded so far to convenience and custom.\r\nPatrick Henry was an antislavery man and placed his position on record\r\nin the following words: \"Is it not amazing that, at a time when the\r\nrights of humanity are defined and understood with precision, in a\r\ncountry above all others fond of liberty, in such an age, we find men\r\nprofessing a religion the most humane, mild, meek, gentle, and generous\r\nadopting a principle as repugnant to humanity as it is inconsistent with\r\nthe Bible and destructive of liberty? Every thinking, honest man rejects\r\nit in speculation, but how few in practice, from conscientious motives!\r\nWould any one believe that I am a master of slaves of my own purchase? I\r\nam drawn along by the general inconvenience of living without them. I\r\nwill not, I cannot, justify it; however culpable my conduct, I will so\r\nfar pay my _devoirs_ to duty as to own the excellence and rectitude of\r\nher precepts and lament my want of conformity to them. I believe a time\r\nwill come when an opportunity will be offered to abolish this lamentable\r\nevil; everything we can do is to improve it, if it happens in our own\r\nday; if not, let us transmit to our own descendants, together with our\r\nslaves, a pity for their unhappy lot and an abhorrence of slavery.\"\r\n\r\nSuch being the character of antislavery sentiment, its chances of\r\nsuccess seem hopeless enough when we hear the other side. When Congress\r\nwas considering the Articles of Confederation, Wilson, of Pennsylvania,\r\nsaid: \"Dismiss your slaves, freemen will take their places.\" The reply\r\nof Lynch, of South Carolina, showed the existence of men willing to\r\nsacrifice everything to the preservation of slavery. \"Our slaves are our\r\nproperty,\" said he; \"if that is debated, there is an end to\r\nconfederation.\"\r\n\r\nThus, at this crisis in the national history, there first distinctively\r\nappeared that aggressive, uncompromising party, afterwards to be known\r\nas the Slave Power--an association of men then forming a minority even\r\nin the South, but determined to carry its point at all hazards; men who\r\nwere willing to sacrifice every consideration of the public good to the\r\npermanence of a system profitable to themselves, but which reduced human\r\nbeings to the level of beasts. Against a party so resolute, antislavery\r\nopinion of the Patrick Henry variety could not prevail. Moreover, the\r\ndistracted state of the country, the imperative necessity for union,\r\nmade every other question seem secondary to the majority of patriotic\r\nstatesmen. In the Constitutional Convention, the Slave Power, then\r\nchiefly represented by South Carolina and Georgia, by threatening to\r\ndefeat the establishment of a stable government and by making the\r\npreservation of slavery a _sine qua non_ to the Union, obtained the\r\nconcessions so big with future disaster.\r\n\r\nThe struggle over this subject in the days of the formation of the\r\ngovernment was the beginning of the \"irrepressible conflict.\" The Slave\r\nPower had come into being as a distinct force, aiming to dominate the\r\nrest of the community in the interest of property in man. On the other\r\nhand, the opposition began to organize. Several abolition and\r\nmanumission societies were formed. The oldest of these was that of\r\nPennsylvania, which in 1787 chose Franklin for its president. A society\r\nwas formed in New York in 1785 with John Jay as president and Alexander\r\nHamilton as secretary; in Rhode Island in 1789, under the lead of Dr.\r\nHopkins. In 1791, before the Connecticut society, Jonathan Edwards the\r\nyounger maintained the doctrine of _immediate emancipation_. Similar\r\nassociations were at work in New Jersey, Virginia, and Maryland.\r\nAntislavery men were thus uniting in their cause, but unfortunately they\r\nwere, with rare exceptions, devoid of the earnestness which\r\ncharacterized their opponents. Their hostility to the system was a\r\nsentiment rather than a principle. It could hasten somewhat emancipation\r\nat the North; but it had no force to contend against the pecuniary\r\ninterests which were daily binding tighter the bonds of the negro in the\r\nSouth. There, in the early years of the present century, the cotton-gin,\r\nwhich had been invented in 1793, gave an impetus to the production of\r\ncotton which nearly doubled the value of slaves. At the North the\r\nprofits of the African trade which supplied this increased demand for\r\nnegroes gave to the Slave Power allies almost as determined as\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe year 1808, fixed by the Constitution as the limit of the duration of\r\nthe slave-trade, witnessed the next contest. The result was a definite\r\nprohibition of the trade by law. But it was a barren victory for the\r\ncause of humanity. The interests involved in both Northern and Southern\r\nStates had grown so large and influential as to make the law a dead\r\nletter. The trade continued with unabated vigour, and marked by even\r\ngreater cruelties to the wretched cargoes. The Slave Power was growing\r\nin strength and determination, bent on controlling the national\r\ngovernment, influencing our foreign relations, reaching out already to\r\ngrasp new slave territory.\r\n\r\nFrom 1818 to 1821 continued the great contest over the admission of\r\nMissouri as a slave State, in which was involved the question whether\r\nthe extension and encouragement of slavery was to be the permanent\r\npolicy of the United States government. Men and words were not wanting\r\nto expose and condemn the contemplated evil. But the Slave Power had\r\ngrown to too great proportions. Henry Clay, who had believed \"slavery to\r\nbe a wrong, a grievous wrong, which no contingency can make right,\" now,\r\nat the behest of slaveholders, threw his great influence against the\r\ncause of humanity. As in the days of the Constitutional Convention the\r\nSlave Power had secured the perpetuation of its system by threats of\r\npreventing a union of the States, so in 1821 it obtained the principle\r\nof the extension of slavery by threats of dissolving the Union. Thomas\r\nJefferson, so faithful an advocate of freedom, was now appalled by the\r\nsound of a strife which, \"like the fire-bell at midnight,\" announced\r\ndisaster, and he counselled concession. Even John Quincy Adams was on\r\nthe same side, \"from extreme unwillingness to put the Union in hazard.\"\r\nSo passed the so-called Compromise, which allowed slavery to break its\r\nbounds and to spread over Arkansas and Missouri. The Slave Power had won\r\na great victory and had shown immense growth. The old apologetic\r\nposition that the system, although wrong, could not be abolished without\r\nentailing greater evils, was now exchanged for the bold doctrine that\r\nslavery was a good thing, to be extended and strengthened.\r\n\r\nThe struggle was growing fiercer and was becoming more clearly an issue\r\nbetween North and South, but the bone of contention was yet the\r\nextension, not the abolition, of slavery. The Slave Power, warned by the\r\nopposition it had met with in Congress, that a new spirit was arising in\r\nthe North, instinctively felt that its position could be maintained only\r\nby further aggression. None but slaveholders were allowed to represent\r\nthe South in Congress, where every public measure was considered first\r\nin the light of its effect upon the institution of slavery. At home,\r\nsuch humane laws regarding the blacks as still existed were repealed,\r\nnew and more cruel enactments were passed, the manumission of slaves by\r\ngrateful or repentant masters was prohibited.\r\n\r\nWhile at the South opinion tended towards united and vigorous action,\r\nthe sentiments of the people at the North were divided. The majority,\r\nalthough disliking slavery \"in the abstract,\" were so fearful of the\r\noutcome of the contention, were so anxious to see some settlement which\r\nwould put an end to agitation, that they were disposed to accept the\r\nline drawn by the Missouri Compromise as the best solution possible, and\r\nto resent any further antislavery expression as an element of profitless\r\ndisturbance. In this class there grew up a dislike of the negroes, a\r\nhatred of the questions involved in their existence among us, a general\r\nprejudice against colour, which tended greatly to the support of the\r\nSlave Power. Many persons who preserved abolition views were lulled into\r\nrepose of conscience by support of the Colonization Society, an\r\norganization formed in the South to get rid of free coloured persons by\r\nshipping them to Africa, but skilfully made to appear as a philanthropic\r\nscheme to solve the slavery problem. Men of the highest character and\r\nwith the best intentions had joined this society in the belief that\r\ntherein might be found the means of uprooting slavery. The ten years\r\nfollowing the Missouri Compromise were unpromising for the cause of the\r\nslave. The Southern States were ceaselessly strengthening themselves.\r\nRace prejudice, the fear of business disturbance, apathy, made the North\r\nacquiescent. Cotton was king, and to that authority conscience\r\nsubmitted.\r\n\r\nStill there were signs of light and materials for improvement. In 1822\r\nthe exciting struggle for the establishment of slavery in Illinois\r\nresulted in favour of freedom. There existed in the country one hundred\r\nand forty antislavery societies, of which one hundred and six were in\r\nthe South. In 1826 was held in Baltimore a convention at which\r\neighty-one of these societies were represented. There was not enough\r\n\"fight\" among these antislavery men to make much impression. Their views\r\nwere directed towards preventing the extension of slavery, towards its\r\nabolition in the District of Columbia (where its existence involved\r\nrecognition by the United States government) and its \"gradual\" cessation\r\nelsewhere. The fact of their holding the convention in Baltimore\r\nindicates the still lingering sympathy of a considerable party in the\r\nSouth, and it shows also that the Slave Power did not look upon them\r\nwith much concern. It is not until antislavery stands upon the platform\r\nof abolition as an _immediate duty_ that it is swept from the face of\r\nthe Southern States.\r\n\r\nThere were earnest men already engaged in a new and more vigorous\r\ncrusade: Elias Hicks, the Quaker, who proclaimed boldly the sin of\r\nowning men or condoning the practice in others; Rev. John Rankin, of\r\nTennessee, who removed with his congregation across the Ohio River,\r\nrather than acquiesce in slavery; William Goodell, of Providence,\r\nbeginning a career of forty years; above all, Benjamin Lundy, who\r\nsacrificed to the cause all that men hold dear. Between 1815 and 1818\r\nfour abolition papers were being published, _The Emancipator_ in\r\nTennessee, _The Abolition Intelligencer_ in Kentucky, _The Liberalist_\r\nin Louisiana, and, most important, Lundy's _Genius of Universal\r\nEmancipation_ in Maryland. All of these papers were published in the\r\nSouth, and the majority of the manumission societies were there. Thus,\r\nin 1826, when William Jay began his labours, the line between freedom\r\nand slavery was not yet drawn. A few slaves were still held in New York.\r\nMany antislavery people were to be found at the South and many\r\npro-slavery people at the North. The United States was a slaveholding\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nJay was a deeply interested observer of the contest in Congress which\r\nresulted in the Missouri Compromise. In 1819, when he was thirty years\r\nof age, his attitude towards the extension of slavery was stated in a\r\nletter to Elias Boudinot:\r\n\r\n\"I have no doubt that the laws of God, and, as a necessary and\r\ninevitable consequence, the true interests of our country, forbid the\r\nextension of slavery. If our country is ever to be redeemed from the\r\ncurse of slavery the present Congress must stand between the living and\r\nthe dead and stay the plague. Now is the accepted time, now is the day\r\nof salvation. If slavery once takes root on the other side of the\r\nMississippi, it can never afterwards be extiminated, but will extend\r\nwith the future Western Empire, poisoning the feelings of humanity,\r\nchecking the growth of those principles of virtue and religion which\r\nconstitute alike the security and happiness of civil society.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year 1826 occurred an incident which marks the beginning of a new\r\nphase in the antislavery struggle--the movement which demanded abolition\r\nin the District of Columbia. There, on territory exclusively under the\r\njurisdiction of the National Congress, it could be claimed justly that\r\nthe question of States rights was not involved and that the\r\nconstitutional provisions did not apply. In this movement, which\r\ncontinued until its object was accomplished in April, 1862, William Jay\r\nwas a pioneer.\r\n\r\nIn August of the year 1826 John Owen, the proprietor of a paper-mill at\r\nCroton Falls, near the Jay farm at Bedford, received a parcel from New\r\nYork which happened to have been wrapped in a Washington newspaper, _The\r\nNational Intelligencer_, of the 1st of August. On looking it over his\r\neye was caught by the following advertisement:\r\n\r\n  \"Was committed to the jail of Washington County, District of\r\n  Columbia, on the 22d of July last, a runaway negro man by the name\r\n  of Gilbert Horton. He is five feet high, stout made, large full\r\n  eyes, and a scar on his left arm near the elbow; had on when\r\n  committed a tarpaulin hat, linen shirt, blue cloth jacket and\r\n  trousers; says that he was born free in the State of New York near\r\n  Peekskill. The owner or owners of the above-described negro man, if\r\n  any, are requested to come and take him away, or he will be sold for\r\n  his jail fees and other expenses, as the law directs.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a sort of grim humour about this advertisement, appearing, as\r\nit did, according to law, in the capital of the great free republic of\r\nthe world, under a flag supposed to typify human liberty. It declared\r\nthat a man who claimed to be and actually was a citizen of the State of\r\nNew York was held in jail without any charge and would be sold into\r\nlifelong slavery unless claimed as a slave by an owner who did not\r\nexist. It declared, in short, that a free citizen of the United States\r\nwho had any negro blood in his veins would be reduced to slavery by the\r\nact of setting foot in the capital of his country. Here was an issue\r\nwhich involved the rights of the State of New York, but could not be\r\nsaid to be an attack on those of Virginia or South Carolina.\r\n\r\nMr. Owen recognized in the Gilbert Horton thus described a free man who\r\nhad worked in his neighbourhood. He lost no time in mounting his horse\r\nand riding over to Bedford to submit the matter to Judge Jay. By the\r\nlatter's advice a letter was despatched at once to the marshal of the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, giving proofs of Horton's freedom, and a meeting\r\nwas called of the citizens of Westchester County to take action on the\r\nsubject. This meeting, held on the 30th of August, with Oliver Green in\r\nthe chair and William Jay as secretary, passed the following\r\nresolutions:\r\n\r\n  \"I. That this meeting view this procedure with the indignation\r\n  becoming men who have a just sense of the value of personal\r\n  liberty, and a proper abhorrence of cruelty and oppression.\r\n\r\n  \"II. That the evidence affords unequivocal proof of the freedom of\r\n  Horton.\r\n\r\n  \"III. That the secretary is hereby desired to transmit to his\r\n  Excellency the Governor the evidence above referred to, and, in the\r\n  name of this meeting, to request his Excellency to demand from the\r\n  proper authorities the instant liberation of the said Horton as a\r\n  free citizen of the State of New York.\r\n\r\n  \"IV. That by the fourth article of the Constitution of the United\r\n  States the citizens of each State are entitled to all the privileges\r\n  and immunities of the several States, and that it is the duty of the\r\n  State of New York to protect its citizens in the enjoyment of these\r\n  rights without regard to their complexion.\r\n\r\n  \"V. That the law under which Horton has been imprisoned, and by\r\n  which a free citizen without evidence of crime and without trial by\r\n  jury may be condemned to servitude for life, is repugnant to our\r\n  republican institutions, and revolting to justice and humanity; and\r\n  that the representatives of this State in Congress are hereby\r\n  requested to use their endeavours to procure its repeal.\r\n\r\n  \"VI. That the secretary, with John Owen, Esq., be a committee to\r\n  prepare and to present to the citizens of this county, for their\r\n  signatures, a petition to Congress for the immediate abolition of\r\n  slavery in the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\n  \"VII. That the proceedings of this meeting be signed by the chairman\r\n  and secretary, and published.\"\r\n\r\nOn receiving from Judge Jay the Westchester resolutions, Governor\r\nClinton submitted them immediately to President John Quincy Adams, who\r\nwas paying a summer visit to his home at Quincy, Mass., with a\r\nrespectful demand for the liberation of Gilbert Horton as a free man and\r\na citizen. The President sent the papers with a letter from himself to\r\nHenry Clay, then Secretary of State. Henry Clay was absent at the time,\r\nand the Chief Clerk of the department wrote to Governor Clinton that the\r\ninstructions of the President had been anticipated by the discharge of\r\nHorton by the marshal of the District. The committal had taken place\r\nunder an old law of Maryland, \"which was adopted by Congress with the\r\nother general laws then in force in that State for the county of\r\nWashington upon its assuming exclusive jurisdiction over the territory.\"\r\n\r\nThis disposal of the case left the principle at issue untouched, and Jay\r\ncould not be satisfied with such a result. His views are expressed in a\r\nletter written in September to Hon. Charles Miner, a member of Congress:\r\n\"Since I read a resolution introduced by you in relation to slavery in\r\nthe District of Columbia, the subject has been scarcely absent from my\r\nmind, and the late imprisonment in Washington of a citizen of this\r\ncounty afforded an opportunity which I gladly embraced of obtaining an\r\nexpression of public opinion. I do not entertain the slightest hope that\r\nour petition will be favourably received, nor the slightest apprehension\r\nthat the cause we espouse will not finally triumph. The history of the\r\nabolition of the slave-trade teaches us the necessity of patient\r\nperseverance, and affords a pledge that perseverance will be ultimately\r\ncrowned with success. We have nothing to fear, but much to hope, from\r\nthe violence and threats of our opponents. Apathy is the only obstacle\r\nwe have reason to dread, and to remove this obstacle it is necessary\r\nthat the attention of the public should be constantly directed to the\r\nsubject. Every discussion in Congress in relation to slavery, no matter\r\nhow great may be the majority against us, advances our cause. We shall\r\nrise more powerful from every defeat.\"\r\n\r\nJay's next step was to draft the memorial to Congress ordered by the\r\nWestchester resolutions. It declared:\r\n\r\n  \"The outrage offered to a citizen of this county, and a violation of\r\n  the constitutional rights involved in that outrage, affords to the\r\n  meeting new and strong evidences of the impropriety of the\r\n  continuance of slavery in the District of Columbia. As citizens of\r\n  the republic, professing to acknowledge that all men are created\r\n  equal, and that they are endowed by their Creator with certain\r\n  inalienable rights, and that among them are life, liberty, and the\r\n  pursuit of happiness, your petitioners cannot but regard it as\r\n  derogatory to the government of the country that its laws should\r\n  violate any of these rights in a territory under its exclusive\r\n  jurisdiction. To your honourable body was given by the Constitution\r\n  the exclusive jurisdiction in all cases whatever over that District,\r\n  and your right and ability to grant the prayer of these petitioners\r\n  cannot be called in question, and the confined limit of the District\r\n  and the comparatively small number of slaves it contains obviates\r\n  the objections sometimes urged against sudden emancipation.\r\n\r\n  \"Your petitioners therefore earnestly entreat your honourable body\r\n  that the government of this great republic, glorying as it does in\r\n  acknowledging and protecting the rights of mankind, diffusing the\r\n  blessings of freedom, may no longer by law withhold these rights and\r\n  blessings from any portion of the inhabitants of its own immediate\r\n  territory, but in the exercise of your prerogative you will\r\n  immediately provide for the abolition of slavery in the District of\r\n  Columbia in such manner as in your wisdom may seem best.\"\r\n\r\nThe publication of the Westchester resolutions elicited no unfavourable\r\ncomments at the North, but it gave no little disquietude to Southern\r\neditors, two of whom declared that black persons travelling in the South\r\nshould carry proofs of their freedom, as whites in Europe were compelled\r\nto carry passports. The introduction of the subject into Congress, even\r\nat that day, when there was no excitement at the North on the subject of\r\nslavery, brought out the susceptibility and dictatorial tone of the\r\nslaveholding interest which marked all subsequent debates up to the\r\nelection of Lincoln.\r\n\r\nSoon after the assembling of Congress in 1827, Mr. Aaron Ward,\r\nrepresenting Westchester County, introduced the resolution: \"That the\r\ncommittee on the District of Columbia be directed to enquire whether\r\nthere be in force in the said District any law which authorizes the\r\nimprisonment of any man of colour and his sale as an unclaimed slave for\r\ngaol fees, and if so to enquire into the expediency of repealing the\r\nsame.\" Mr. Ward accompanied his resolution with remarks of a moderate\r\ncharacter, referring to the circumstances of Horton's arrest, the fact\r\nof his being a citizen of New York, and the danger in which he stood of\r\nbeing sold as a slave; he contrasted the law under which such\r\nproceedings could be had with the provisions of the national\r\nConstitution; and he concluded by saying: \"The jurisdiction of the\r\nDistrict, sir, ought to be exhibited to the country and to the world\r\nwithout a stain. Its object should be not to oppress but to vindicate\r\nthe rights of freemen, and if there is a spot on earth where these\r\nrights are to be held sacred that place is the District of Columbia.\"\r\n\r\nFor a Northern man merely to touch upon the rights of coloured persons\r\nwas enough to arouse the leading Southern members of the House to angry\r\nopposition. John Forsythe, who as minister to Spain had arranged the\r\nsession of Florida, James Hamilton, already an extreme advocate of\r\nStates rights and afterwards Governor of South Carolina, Charles A.\r\nWickliffe, afterwards Postmaster-General under President Tyler, and\r\nGeorge McDuffie, of Georgia, all took pains to throw ridicule upon the\r\nresolution, or to oppose its consideration. They considered, no doubt\r\ncorrectly, that to have any negroes spoken of in Congress otherwise than\r\nas property was an indirect blow at slavery. W. L. Brent, of Maryland,\r\nsaid that the resolution as it stood was calculated to excite only angry\r\ndebate and irritated feelings. If the mover would omit the words \"being\r\na citizen of any State,\" the most objectionable part would be removed.\r\nMr. Ward consented to this emasculation and his resolution was then\r\ncarried. The committee reported on the 16th July, that in the District\r\nof Columbia, \"if a free man of colour should be apprehended as a\r\nrunaway, he is subjected to the payment of all fees and rewards given by\r\nlaw for apprehending runaways; and upon failure to make such payment, is\r\nliable to be sold as a slave.\" \"That is,\" said Judge Jay, \"a man\r\nacknowledged to be free and unaccused of any offence is to be sold as a\r\nslave to pay fees and rewards given by law for apprehending runaways. If\r\nTurkish despotism is disgraced by an enactment of equal atrocity, we are\r\nignorant of the fact.\" The committee thought the law rather hard, and\r\nrecommended such an alteration of it as would make such charges payable\r\nby the corporation of Washington. But even this alteration was never\r\nmade. \"The code of Washington,\" Jay said some years later, \"is yet\r\npolluted by unquestionably the most iniquitous statute in Christendom.\"\r\nAnd the fact continued that a coloured citizen of a free State could be\r\nsold into slavery if found in Washington. Convinced that no reform could\r\nbe expected except by the total abolition of slavery on United States\r\nterritory, convinced, too, that this was the first necessary step in a\r\ncampaign against slavery itself, Jay set on foot a movement for popular\r\npetitions to Congress and for legislative expression in behalf of their\r\nconsideration. The Pennsylvania Legislature passed such resolutions in\r\nJanuary, 1829; the New York Assembly followed soon afterwards, when Jay\r\nwrote to his friend Charles Miner: \"The mail this evening brings the\r\nnews that resolutions instructing our representatives in Congress to\r\nvote for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia have\r\npassed our Assembly by a vote of 57 to 39. In the fulness of my heart I\r\nthank God and take courage.\" Among his co-workers at this time was Henry\r\nD. Sedgwick, to whom he wrote in 1831: \"I have read your pamphlet with\r\nmuch interest; your ideas on the abolition of slavery correspond with\r\nthose I have long entertained and expressed. Duty is the only safe rule\r\nof expediency. No nation ever has suffered, and none ever will, for\r\ndoing justice and loving mercy. But moral considerations apart, I have\r\nno doubt it would be wise policy in the Southern States immediately to\r\nemancipate their slaves. The period must arrive when slavery must cease\r\non this continent. The progress of knowledge and religion, the example\r\nof St. Domingo, the abolition of slavery in Mexico and South America,\r\nthe decreasing value of slave labour, and the rapidly augmenting\r\ncoloured population in the South, all combine in rendering this event\r\ninevitable. But the slaves will either receive their freedom as a boon,\r\nor they will wrest it by force from their masters; and the evils\r\nattending these two modes of emancipation certainly bear no proportion\r\nto each other. You remark, 'Our country fought for justice and should\r\nbe ready to render the justice which it demanded.' I observe a similar\r\nsentiment in a letter written by my father from Spain to Judge Benson\r\nduring the contest to which you allude. Speaking of the abolition of\r\nslavery, he says, 'Till America comes into this measure her prayers to\r\nHeaven for liberty will be impious.' This is a strong expression, but it\r\nis just. Were I in your Legislature I would prepare a bill for the\r\npurpose with great care, and would never cease moving it till it became\r\na law or I ceased to be a member. I believe that God governs the world,\r\nand I believe it to be a maxim in His Court, as in ours, that those who\r\nask for equity ought to do it. I do not think the free States guiltless\r\nof upholding slavery while, through their representatives, they tolerate\r\nit in the District of Columbia. Were the free States to will it, slavery\r\nwould cease at the capital of the republic, and an example would be set\r\nthat could not fail of having a salutary influence.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: After Gilbert Stuart.       A. W. Elson & Co., Boston\r\nJohn Jay]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF THE ANTISLAVERY MOVEMENT.--ORGANIZATION OF\r\n  ANTISLAVERY SOCIETIES.--ANTI-ABOLITION RIOTS.--JAY PUBLISHES HIS\r\n  \"INQUIRY.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nChief-Justice Jay died at Bedford in 1828, and his son William occupied\r\nhis leisure during the following five years in preparing \"The Life and\r\nLetters of John Jay.\" This work was published in two octavo volumes in\r\n1833, and was highly praised for both thoroughness and impartiality.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile events were occurring which raised antislavery sentiment from\r\nthe torpor in which it had fallen after the excitement of the Missouri\r\nCompromise, and which brought the whole question before the people as a\r\nlive issue which compelled attention. Between the years 1829 and 1832\r\ntook place a remarkable series of debates in Virginia on the subject of\r\nslavery, brought about by dissatisfaction with the State constitution\r\nand by the Nat Turner massacre, in which a number of slaves had risen\r\nagainst their masters. In these debates the evils of slavery were\r\nexposed as clearly as they were afterwards by the Abolitionists, and\r\nwith an outspoken freedom which, when indulged in by Northern men, was\r\nsoon to be denounced as treasonable and incendiary. These Southern\r\nspeakers were silenced by the Slave Power. But there were men in the\r\nNorth who thought the same and who would not be silenced. Chief among\r\nthese was William Lloyd Garrison. He had begun his memorable career by\r\ncirculating petitions in Vermont in 1828 in favor of emancipation in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia. Having joined Lundy in Baltimore in editing the\r\n_Genius of Universal Emancipation_, he had suffered ignominy in the\r\ncause in a Southern jail; drawing from persecution and hardship only new\r\ninspiration, he began the publication of the _Liberator_ at Boston in\r\nJanuary, 1831. In the following year, under his leadership, was formed\r\nthe New England Anti-Slavery Society, which placed itself on the new\r\nground that _immediate, unconditional emancipation, without\r\nexpatriation, was the right of every slave and could not be withheld by\r\nhis master an hour without sin_. In March, 1833, the _Weekly\r\nEmancipator_ was established in New York, with the assistance of Arthur\r\nand Lewis Tappan, and under the editorship of William Goodell. In the\r\nsame year appeared at Haverhill, Mass., a vigorous pamphlet by John G.\r\nWhittier, entitled \"Justice and Expediency, or Slavery considered with a\r\nView to its Rightful and Effectual Remedy, Abolition.\" Nearly\r\nsimultaneously were published Mrs. Lydia Maria Child's \"Appeal in Behalf\r\nof that Class of Americans called Africans,\" and a pamphlet by Elizur\r\nWright, Jr., a professor in the Western Reserve College, on \"The Sin of\r\nSlavery and its Remedy.\"\r\n\r\nThese publications and the doctrines of the _Liberator_ produced great\r\nexcitement throughout the country. The South had been able to hear the\r\nwords \"gradual emancipation\" with a confident equanimity, and only a few\r\nyears before had tolerated a convention in Baltimore gathered to forward\r\nthat object. But the word \"immediate\" now prefixed to emancipation acted\r\nas a firebrand to gunpowder. Southern newspapers and politicians could\r\nnot find epithets strong enough to denounce the fanatical incendiaries\r\nwho said that slavery, being wrong in itself, should cease at once. A\r\nreward was offered by a Southern Legislature for the person of Garrison,\r\ndead or alive. For lending Whittier's pamphlet to a white man Dr. Reuben\r\nCrandall was tried for his life at Washington on the charge of\r\n\"circulating Tappan, Garrison & Co.'s papers encouraging the negroes to\r\ninsurrection.\"\r\n\r\nThe lives of the abolitionists were safer at the North, but their\r\nprinciples were condemned there in terms quite as decided. To say that\r\nslavery ought to be immediately abolished was sufficient cause for the\r\nclergyman to lose his pulpit and the merchant his credit. The new\r\ndoctrine was too sound to be ignored, and its agitation was\r\ndisorganizing, vexatious, injurious to business, destructive of private\r\nand political peace. The North agreed with the South that slavery was\r\nnot a subject to which the right of free speech applied. The\r\nabolitionists were accused of injuring the cause of the blacks by their\r\nproceedings. And indeed, at the South the treatment of the slave became\r\nharsher, and at the North the prejudice against the free negro was\r\nintensified. In 1833 Miss Crandall, a Quaker lady, endeavoured to\r\nestablish a boarding-school for the education of coloured girls in\r\nCanterbury, Conn. A committee of the inhabitants waited upon her, who\r\nrepresented \"that by putting her design into execution she would bring\r\nruin and disgrace upon them all.\" Three town meetings were held in one\r\nweek to discuss ways and means to suppress a scheme which would render\r\n\"insecure the persons, property, and reputation of our citizens.\" The\r\nState of Connecticut passed a special law to forbid the establishment of\r\nsuch a school. Under it, Miss Crandall was tried and convicted. The\r\nconstitutionality of the law was called in question and the case was\r\nappealed. But the inhabitants of Canterbury thought the crisis too\r\nserious to depend on legal technicalities. Miss Crandall was driven from\r\nthe town by persecution. The shops would sell her no food; her well was\r\nfilled with manure, and water from other sources refused; her house was\r\nsmeared with filth and finally set on fire. The trustees of the Noyes\r\nAcademy in Plymouth, N. H., having consented to the admission of\r\ncoloured pupils, the respectable people of the town avoided the\r\ncontemplated disgrace by moving the school building from its\r\nfoundations and depositing it in a swamp. In 1835 a wealthy coloured\r\nman bought a pew on the floor of Park Street Church in Boston. His\r\nneighbours nailed up the door of the pew, and so many \"aggrieved\r\nbrethren\" threatened to leave that the trustees were obliged to prevent\r\nthe threatened contamination of the sanctuary by excluding the coloured\r\npew-holder. A hundred similar cases might be cited to show that before\r\nthe emancipation of the slaves could gain even a hearing, the North had\r\nto be educated to consider the negro race as human beings capable of\r\nimprovement and deserving of humane encouragement.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1833, Judge Jay contributed to the first number of the\r\n_Emancipator_ a letter which sets forth his own views of the problem of\r\nAmerican slavery at that time and also some of the difficulties in the\r\npath of the emancipationists:\r\n\r\n  \"The duty and policy of immediate emancipation, although clear to\r\n  us, are not so to multitudes of good people who abhor slavery and\r\n  sincerely wish its removal. They take it for granted, no matter why\r\n  or wherefore, that if the slaves were now liberated they would\r\n  instantly cut the throats and fire the dwellings of their\r\n  benefactors. Hence these good people look upon the advocates of\r\n  emancipation as a set of dangerous fanatics, who are jeopardizing\r\n  the peace of the Southern States and riveting the fetters of the\r\n  slaves by the very attempt to break them. In their opinion the\r\n  slaves are not fit for freedom, and therefore it is necessary to\r\n  wait patiently till they are. Now, unless these patient waiters can\r\n  be brought over to our side, emancipation is hopeless; for, first,\r\n  they are an immense majority of all among us who are hostile to\r\n  slavery; and, secondly, they are as conscientious in their opinions\r\n  as we are in ours, and unless converted will oppose and defeat all\r\n  our efforts. But how are they to be converted? Only by the\r\n  exhibition of Truth. The moral, social, and political evils of\r\n  slavery are but imperfectly known and considered. These should be\r\n  portrayed in strong but true colours, and it would not be difficult\r\n  to prove that, however inconvenient and dangerous emancipation may\r\n  be, the continuance of slavery must be infinitely more inconvenient\r\n  and dangerous.\r\n\r\n  \"Constitutional restrictions, independent of other considerations,\r\n  forbid all other than moral interference with slavery in the\r\n  Southern States. But we have as good and perfect a right to exhort\r\n  slaveholders to liberate their slaves as we have to exhort them to\r\n  practice any virtue or avoid any vice. Nay, we have not only the\r\n  right, but under certain circumstances it may be our duty to give\r\n  such advice; and while we confine ourselves within the boundaries of\r\n  right and duty, we may and ought to disregard the threats and\r\n  denunciations by which we may be assailed.\r\n\r\n  \"The question of slavery in the District of Columbia is totally\r\n  distinct, as far as we are concerned, from that of slavery in the\r\n  Southern States.\r\n\r\n  \"As a member of Congress, I should think myself no more authorized\r\n  to legislate for the slaves of Virginia than for the serfs of\r\n  Russia. But Congress has full authority to abolish slavery in the\r\n  District, and I think it to be its duty to do so. The public need\r\n  information respecting the abominations committed at Washington with\r\n  the sanction of their representatives--abominations which will cease\r\n  whenever those representatives please. If this subject is fully and\r\n  ably pressed upon the attention of our electors, they may perhaps\r\n  be induced to require pledges from candidates for Congress for their\r\n  votes for the removal of this foul stain from our National\r\n  Government. As to the Colonization Society, it is neither a wicked\r\n  conspiracy on the one hand nor a panacea for slavery on the other.\r\n  Many good and wise men belong to it and believe in its efficacy.\"\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1833 the abolitionists of Great Britain succeeded in\r\nobtaining the act of emancipation for the 800,000 slaves in the West\r\nIndies. In June Arthur Tappan wrote to Judge Jay asking for his \"opinion\r\nas to the expediency of forming an American Antislavery Society and of\r\ndoing it now. The impulse given to the cause by the movement in England\r\nwould, it appears to me, aid us greatly here.\" Jay replied very\r\ncautiously. A New York society, he thought, might be desirable\r\nimmediately. The constitutions and proceedings of such societies\r\ndemanded great caution and prudence; they must blend the wisdom of the\r\nserpent with the harmlessness of the dove. The Southern people affected\r\nto apprehend an unconstitutional interference with their property, as\r\nthey called it, by the Northern abolitionists, and no ground for such\r\npretended fear should be given. With this view, he suggested the\r\nincorporation into the constitution of antislavery societies a distinct\r\ndeclaration, such as the following: \"We concede that Congress, under the\r\npresent National Compact, has no right to interfere with any of the\r\nslave States in relation to this momentous subject. But we maintain\r\nthat Congress has a right and is solemnly bound to suppress the domestic\r\nslave-trade between the several States and to abolish slavery in those\r\nportions of our territory which the Constitution has placed under its\r\nexclusive jurisdiction.\" He further suggested that the two subjects, the\r\nColonization Society and the political condition of the free blacks,\r\nshould be avoided. \"Duty and policy,\" he said, \"in my opinion demand the\r\nemancipation of our slaves, but they do not demand that immediately on\r\ntheir emancipation they shall be invested with the right of suffrage.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of October the New York City Antislavery Society was\r\nsuccessfully organized, despite an active and organized effort to\r\nprevent it. A call had been issued for a meeting of the friends of\r\nimmediate emancipation at Clinton Hall. A counter-notice was published,\r\nsigned \"Many Southerners,\" inviting a meeting at the same time and\r\nplace. The proprietors of Clinton Hall, alarmed at the situation,\r\nrefused to let it to the abolitionists, who then applied to the Clinton\r\nHotel, where they were also refused. The Southerners and their Northern\r\nsympathizers, finding Clinton Hotel closed, held a meeting at Tammany\r\nHall, with General Bogardus, the United States Marshal, in the chair,\r\nwith speeches and resolutions against the abolitionists, when a report\r\nthat the abolitionists were in session at Chatham Street Hall sent them\r\nthere in haste, only to find the Hall closed and dark. An eye-witness\r\ndescribed the crowd assembled by the Southern call as \"a genuine\r\ndrunken, infuriated mob of blackguards of every species, some with good\r\nclothes, and the major part the very sweepings of the city.\" The public\r\nwas amused the next morning by a leading editorial in the _Courier and\r\nEnquirer_, congratulating the country on the failure of the\r\n\"disorganizing fanatics to organize a society fraught with danger to the\r\nUnion and based upon an open violation of the United States\r\nConstitution;\" while the advertising column of the same sheet contained\r\nthe official proceedings of the abolitionists at the Chatham Street\r\nChapel, where with promptness, energy, and order they had received the\r\nreport of a committee, adopted a constitution, elected officers,\r\nadjourned and closed the building before the arrival of the rioters from\r\nTammany. The successful management of the affair was due chiefly to the\r\ncoolness and skill of Lewis Tappan, to whose devotion and energy the\r\nantislavery cause was from this time constantly indebted. The peaceful\r\nand lawful aims of the society, its frank acknowledgment of the rights\r\nof the Southern States were set forth in its constitution:\r\n\r\n  \"While it admits that each State in which slavery exists has, by the\r\n  Constitution of the United States, the exclusive right to legislate\r\n  in regard to its abolition in said State, it shall aim to convince\r\n  all our fellow-citizens, by arguments addressed to their\r\n  understandings and consciences, that slaveholding is a heinous crime\r\n  in the sight of God, and that the duty, safety, and best interest\r\n  of all concerned require its immediate abandonment, without\r\n  expatriation. The society will also endeavour in a constitutional\r\n  way to influence Congress to put an end to the domestic slave-trade\r\n  and to abolish slavery in all those portions of our common country\r\n  which come under its control, especially in the District of\r\n  Columbia, and likewise to prevent the extension of it to any State\r\n  that may hereafter be admitted to the Union.\r\n\r\n  \"The society shall aim to elevate the character and condition of the\r\n  people of colour, by encouraging their intellectual, moral, and\r\n  religious improvement, and by removing public prejudice, that thus\r\n  they may _according to their intellectual and moral worth_ share an\r\n  equality with the whites of civil and religious privileges; but this\r\n  society will never in any way countenance the oppressed in\r\n  vindicating their rights by resorting to physical force.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the distinct and moderate language in which the society\r\nset forth its lawful objects, pro-slavery prejudice was aroused to\r\nviolent opposition. A week later a meeting was called to protest against\r\nthe \"reckless agitations of the abolitionists.\" Theodore Frelinghuysen,\r\nUnited States Senator from New Jersey, declared that \"nine tenths of the\r\nhorrors of slavery were imaginary,\" that \"the crusade of abolition\" was\r\n\"the poetry of philanthropy,\" that emancipationists were \"seeking to\r\ndissolve the Union.\" Chancellor Walworth came down from Albany to say\r\nthat they were \"reckless incendiaries\" and their efforts\r\nunconstitutional. David B. Ogden declared the doctrine of immediate\r\nemancipation to be \"a palpable and direct nullification of the\r\nConstitution.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of October, 1833, a circular invitation was addressed to\r\nJudge Jay and others to attend a convention at Philadelphia on the 4th\r\nDecember to form a National Antislavery Society. This step was taken in\r\nconcurrence with the views of the friends of immediate emancipation in\r\nBoston, Providence, New York, and Philadelphia. Among the motives for\r\norganizing such a society without delay it was argued that union is\r\nstrength; that the advocates of the immediate abolition of slavery,\r\nthough comparatively few and much scattered, were many in the aggregate,\r\nand could act, when combined, with irresistible power; that the cause\r\nwas urgent, public expectation excited, its friends to some extent\r\ncommitted to such a movement during the present year; that they had the\r\nexample of similar organizations, which, though feeble and condemned by\r\npublic opinion in the outset, had speedily risen to great influence, and\r\nhad been the means under God of immense benefit to the human race,\r\nespecially in the case of the National Antislavery Society of Great\r\nBritain, and of the American Temperance Society. The invitation was\r\nsigned by a committee consisting of Arthur Tappan, Joshua Leavitt, and\r\nElizur Wright, Jr., all officers of the New York Antislavery Society.\r\n\r\nAt the same time Judge Jay received a letter from Rev. Samuel J. May\r\nurging him to be present. \"This is a cause,\" wrote May, \"in which our\r\nwisest and best and most prudent men ought to engage. There never has\r\nbeen in our country so great a demand for the exertions of true patriots\r\nand real Christians.... Let me beg of you to be there, at the\r\nconvention. I have heard the hope that you will be there expressed most\r\nfervently by many.\"\r\n\r\nJay replied to the committee that he could not be present. \"It would\r\nperhaps be uncandid to conceal from you,\" he said, \"that the expediency\r\nof the proposed attempt to form a National Society at the present time\r\nseems to me to be at least questionable. May it not increase the\r\nirritation and hostility extensively felt towards abolitionists without\r\npromoting their objects more effectually than local societies? If,\r\nhowever, a National Society is to be formed, it is to be hoped its\r\nproceedings will be marked with great prudence and moderation. The great\r\nobjection made to antislavery associations is that they aim at an\r\nunconstitutional interference with slavery. This objection, false as I\r\nam persuaded it is, has nevertheless an extensive and injurious\r\ninfluence, and unless it be removed success will be hopeless. It seems\r\nto me, therefore, of the utmost importance that correct constitutional\r\nprinciples on this subject should not only be entertained, but\r\nexplicitly and unequivocally avowed by every antislavery society. This\r\navowal might be made in the preamble of their constitution in some form\r\nlike the following:\r\n\r\n  \"'The object of this society is to promote the abolition of slavery\r\n  in the United States. As all legislation relative to slavery in the\r\n  several States in which it exists can be constitutionally exercised\r\n  only by their respective Legislatures, this society will endeavour\r\n  to effect its object, so far as relates to these States, by argument\r\n  addressed to the understanding and conscience of their citizens. But\r\n  inasmuch as the Federal Constitution confers on Congress the\r\n  exclusive right to legislate for the District of Columbia, this\r\n  society will use all such lawful and constitutional means as may be\r\n  deemed advisable to induce Congress to abolish slavery in that\r\n  District without delay.'\r\n\r\n\"I am very sensible that the friends of emancipation hold these\r\nprinciples, but not having given them sufficient prominence in their\r\nwritings they have subjected themselves to much injurious suspicion.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Jay's letter was read on the first day of the Antislavery\r\nConvention held in Philadelphia in December, 1833; and in the\r\ndeclaration of principles, reported by William Lloyd Garrison, John G.\r\nWhittier, and Samuel J. May, and unanimously adopted by the convention,\r\nappeared the following clauses, by which the abolitionists were enabled\r\nto repel the charge, so persistently made, that they sought to\r\naccomplish their ends by unconstitutional means, by asking Congress to\r\nexceed its power by meddling with slavery in the States:\r\n\r\n  \"We fully and unanimously recognize the sovereignty of each State to\r\n  legislate exclusively on the subject of slavery which is tolerated\r\n  within its limits; we concede that Congress under the present\r\n  National Compact has no right to interfere with any of the slave\r\n  States in relation to this momentous subject.\r\n\r\n  \"But we maintain that Congress has a right and is solemnly bound to\r\n  suppress the domestic slave-trade between the several States, and to\r\n  abolish slavery in those portions of our territory which the\r\n  Constitution has placed under its exclusive jurisdiction.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1838 an energetic attempt was made by Alvan Stewart, of Utica, to\r\nstrike out the clause in the constitution of the American Antislavery\r\nSociety which recognized the rights of the Southern States under the\r\nUnited States Constitution. Jay perceived the injury that such a course\r\nwould inflict on the position of the abolitionists. It would, indeed,\r\nhave committed the society to the doctrine that Congress could continue\r\nslavery in the States. He opposed the change with vigour during a debate\r\nof two days and succeeded in maintaining the all-important clause.\r\n\r\nLooked at by the light of subsequent events, the importance of placing\r\nthe antislavery movement on a strictly constitutional basis cannot be\r\noverrated. Upon the principles thus distinctly avowed rested the moral\r\nand political strength of the movement during a struggle of nearly\r\nthirty years. And these principles became, in 1854, under the guidance\r\nof the founders of the Republican party, the chief plank in the platform\r\nof that great organization, under whose sturdy lead, aided by citizens\r\nof all parties, the supremacy of the national Constitution was\r\nmaintained, the integrity of the national territory was preserved,\r\nslavery was ended, and the republic saved.\r\n\r\nJudge Jay was not yet officially connected with the antislavery\r\nsocieties, but his sympathy was close with them and their officers. At\r\nthe request of the Executive Committee of the New York society, he\r\ndrafted a petition for abolition in the District of Columbia for\r\ncirculation in New York, in which he again distinctly drew the line\r\nbetween the power of Congress over the District and its want of power as\r\nregarded the States. This careful discrimination had no weight with the\r\nmany who were unwilling to admit that anything said or done by the\r\nabolitionists was right. But it succeeded with more liberal men, among\r\nthem the good Chancellor Kent. The Chancellor, whose reputation as a\r\njurist was second to none, signed the petition, which he declared to\r\ncontain \"no unconstitutional doctrine.\"\r\n\r\nThe first anniversary of the American Antislavery Society was held at\r\nthe Chatham Street Chapel in the beginning of May, 1834. Arthur Tappan\r\npresided, and addresses were made by Elizur Wright, Jr., Rev. Amos A.\r\nPhelps of Boston, James A. Stone of Kentucky, a delegate from the Lane\r\nSeminary, Robert Purvis of Philadelphia, Rev. Henry G. Ludlow, Wm. Lloyd\r\nGarrison, and Charles Stewart. The meeting met with disorderly\r\ninterruptions; the newspapers contained abusive attacks upon the\r\nabolitionists and appealed against them to the passions of the lowest\r\nand most ignorant class in the community. \"All this violence and\r\nobloquy,\" remarked Judge Jay, \"are not without an object, and that\r\nobject is intimidation.\" The truth of this observation was soon\r\ndisgracefully verified. When the Fourth of July was celebrated at the\r\nChatham Street Chapel by an antislavery oration from David Paul Brown of\r\nPhiladelphia, the disorderly elements evoked by the press against the\r\nblacks and abolitionists responded in large force and with increased\r\nlawlessness. On the 9th of July a mob assembled at the Chapel, broke\r\nopen the doors, passed resolutions in favor of the Colonization Society\r\nand by a suggestive vote adjourned until the next meeting of the\r\nAntislavery Society. The mob then proceeded to the Bowery Theatre to\r\navenge some expressions attributed to an English actor, and next to the\r\nhouse of Mr. Lewis Tappan, which was attacked with bricks and stones,\r\nthe furniture broken up and burned in the street. The riots continued\r\nfor several days with little hindrance from the city authorities. Six\r\nchurches were attacked and a large number of houses occupied by\r\nabolitionists or by coloured people. Against the latter the fury of the\r\nmob was especially directed. The same scenes of riot and cruelty toward\r\nthe helpless blacks occurred in Philadelphia, where forty-five houses\r\nwere destroyed. It was evident that the arguments of the abolitionists\r\ncould not be met except with violence. The mobs, as usual, were\r\ncowardly. In some cases the determined action of the abolitionists\r\nafforded them the protection refused by the police. It was announced\r\nthat among the houses to be attacked was that of Dr. Abraham L. Cox, in\r\nBroome Street, a few doors east of Broadway. John Jay, then a student at\r\nColumbia College, was living in the house. Some members of the New York\r\nYoung Men's Antislavery Society, with guns and pistols, were gathered\r\nwithin and notice was given publicly that an attack would be repelled by\r\nforce. Late that night the mob in its lawless career passed close to Dr.\r\nCox's house, but did not dare to molest it. Similar preparations for\r\ndefence saved the store of Arthur Tappan.\r\n\r\nWhile the New York mob, as the _Commercial Advertiser_ said, were \"now\r\nnightly engaged in deeds of violence,\" the same paper distinctly took\r\nthe ground that the abolitionists should not enjoy \"the protection of\r\nthe law and the aid of the military,\" except \"on condition that the\r\ncausers of these mischiefs shall be abated and the outrages upon public\r\nfeelings from the forum, the pulpit, and the press shall no more be\r\nrepeated by these reckless incendiaries.\" The _Courier and Inquirer_ of\r\nthe same day said: \"Now we tell them [the abolitionists] that when they\r\nopenly and publicly promulgate doctrines which outrage public feelings,\r\nthey have no right to demand protection of the people they insult,\" and\r\nthey must understand \"that they prosecute their treasonable and beastly\r\nplans at their own peril.\" Such was the view taken of American freedom\r\nof speech by the pro-slavery party. The manly traits of American\r\ncharacter seemed to be lost in the prevailing atmosphere of race\r\nprejudice, cowardice, and injustice. Politicians of both parties,\r\nrepresentatives of the commercial and professional classes of the North,\r\nacquiesced in a policy which they thought would advance their views, but\r\nwhich was destructive of the fundamental principles of American liberty.\r\nThe highest and the lowest had joined hands to assail the coloured\r\npeople and their friends. Names honoured in the Church and the State,\r\nwhich should have helped to elevate public opinion and to guide it in\r\nthe path of justice, obeyed the mandates and echoed the denunciations of\r\nthe Slave Power. For a time was presented an alliance in behalf of\r\nslavery of the highest classes with the scum of politicians and\r\ncriminals. The intrepid William Leggett was one of the few who dared to\r\npublish the truth. \"The fury of demons,\" he wrote in the _Evening Post_,\r\n\"seems to have entered into the breasts of our misguided populace. The\r\nrights of public and private property, the obligations of law, the\r\nauthority of its ministers and even the power of the military are all\r\nequally spurned by these audacious sons of riot and disorder.\" Candid\r\nand cautious thinkers began to take alarm at the disregard for law which\r\nseemed to be spreading through the country. \"These mobs,\" wrote Dr.\r\nChanning, \"are indeed most dishonourable to us as a people, because they\r\nhave been too much the expression of public sentiment, ... because\r\nthere was a willingness that the antislavery movement should be put down\r\nby force.\"\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the mobs, and the encouragement given to them by the\r\npress, aroused the spirit and stimulated the energy of the\r\nabolitionists. \"These crimes,\" said Judge Jay, \"abundantly prove the\r\nextreme cruelty and sinfulness of that prejudice against colour which we\r\nare impiously told is an ordination of Providence. Colonizationists,\r\nassuming the prejudice to be natural and invincible, propose to remove\r\nits victims beyond its influence. Abolitionists, on the contrary,\r\nremembering with the Psalmist 'that it is He that hath made us, and not\r\nwe ourselves,' believe that the benevolent Father of us all requires us\r\nto treat with justice and kindness every portion of the human family.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough he had been an earnest emancipationist for ten years, Judge Jay\r\nhad had doubts of the wisdom of forming antislavery societies at so\r\nearly a period in the movement. He had feared that unmeasured and\r\nunconstitutional doctrines might be adopted which would set the cause in\r\na false light before the country. His advice had been sought and\r\nfollowed, as we have seen, and there was no longer any reason why he\r\nshould not become an active member. In 1834, immediately after the riots\r\nand when the outlook seemed darkest, he took a place on the Executive\r\nCommittee of the National Society.\r\n\r\n\"In that season of feverish excitement,\" wrote Hon. Henry Wilson,\r\n\"Judge William Jay, inheriting not only the honoured name, but the\r\nprinciples and purity of the illustrious Chief-Justice, at first\r\ndeclined an office in the new society, deeming its organization\r\npremature,\" but now \"sought to take his share of its labours and\r\nresponsibilities. His name gave prestige; his talents, learning, and\r\nintegrity afforded strength, while his cautious and ready pen laid\r\nprecious gifts upon its altar.\"\r\n\r\nIn February, 1835, was published Jay's \"Inquiry into the Character and\r\nTendency of the American Colonization and American Antislavery\r\nSocieties.\" The book bore upon its title-page the words of Milton, \"Give\r\nme liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely, according to my\r\nconscience, above all liberties\"--a sentiment considered treasonable in\r\nAmerica by the Slave Power. This work had a powerful effect upon public\r\nopinion, not only on account of the arguments it contained, but largely\r\non account of the character and position of its author. It was the\r\npolicy of the pro-slavery party to represent the abolitionists as\r\nignorant and reckless agitators, with nothing to lose. But here was a\r\nman of family and fortune, a judge on the bench, high in the counsels of\r\nthe Episcopal Church, who set forth the detested doctrines with judicial\r\nmoderation and unanswerable logic.\r\n\r\nJay began by an exposure of the Colonization Society. He showed that it\r\nwas merely a scheme to get rid of the free blacks at the South, where\r\nthey were regarded as a nuisance; that its officers represented it at\r\nthe North as a solution of the slavery question to quiet\r\nemancipationists and to obtain their subscriptions. He set forth the\r\nconstitutional and merciful objects of the American Antislavery Society.\r\nHe showed that abolitionists were neither acting in opposition to law,\r\nnor were in any manner exciting the slaves to insurrection; that the\r\nopinions they professed were such as had been freely uttered by\r\nJefferson, Franklin, and numerous Southern statesmen within fifty years.\r\nHe exposed the cruel character of American slavery, the beastly\r\ndegradation, physical, moral, and mental, to which it condemned the\r\nblacks; the horrors of the interstate slave-trade, tearing husband from\r\nwife and children from their mothers to be sold into distant places; he\r\npointed out the national disgrace involved in the fact that in the city\r\nof Washington, under the stars and stripes, slave-dealers were licensed\r\nto ply their trade in human flesh, leading the chained \"coffles\" of\r\nblack wretches about the streets. The concluding chapters were devoted\r\nto showing that emancipation could be accomplished with safety, and that\r\nthe real danger to the country lay in the continuation of slavery.\r\n\r\nThe welcome extended to this book by the avowed abolitionists is\r\nillustrated by the following extract from the annual report of the\r\nMassachusetts Antislavery Society in 1836: \"We know it will not be\r\nthought invidious towards others who have greatly contributed by their\r\nexcellent writings to help on our glorious enterprise, if we make\r\nespecial mention of the volume from the pen of the Hon. William Jay of\r\nNew York. His 'Inquiry' was published in the early part of last year.\r\nComing from him, a man extensively known, and highly respected and\r\nbeloved by all who know him, it could not fail to command the public\r\nattention. The very rapid sale of the first and second editions evinced\r\nthe eagerness of thousands to know the results of his inquiry into the\r\nsentiments and plans of the two societies which had stood from the birth\r\nof the latter in the attitude of opposition. It is a book so full of\r\npertinent facts and carefully drawn conclusions that it could not fail\r\nto impart the convictions of its author to other minds. No book on the\r\nsubject has probably been read by more persons, nor has any one been\r\ninstrumental to the conversion of more.\"\r\n\r\nThe importance of the \"Inquiry\" to the antislavery cause is illustrated\r\nby the diverse character of the men whose attention was attracted by\r\nit--men whose conservative habits of mind, whose business and\r\nprofessional interests caused them to ignore if not to condemn the\r\nabolitionists. \"Your book,\" wrote Rev. Beriah Green, who presided at the\r\norganization of the American Antislavery Society in Philadelphia, \"will\r\ncommand a large circle of readers who could not be persuaded to examine\r\na paragraph written by any of us who have so long been known and hated\r\nand execrated as abolitionists. To many of these, your arguments, so\r\nskilfully arranged, so powerfully described, so happily conducted to so\r\ntriumphant a conclusion, must prove convincing. They must abandon their\r\n'miry clay,' and, aided by your hand, take a position 'on the rock.'\"\r\nAmong leading men influenced by Jay's \"Inquiry\" may be mentioned Dr.\r\nAlonzo Potter, afterwards Bishop of Pennsylvania, and Peter G.\r\nStuyvesant, a representative of the solid Knickerbockers of New York.\r\nEdward Delavan, of Albany, wrote: \"You have done the cause of humanity\r\nan incalculable amount of good by the work.\" Mrs. Theodore Sedgwick\r\nwrote from Stockbridge: \"We are reading your book on American slavery\r\nwith great interest. You have rendered an invaluable service to the\r\ncountry and to the cause of humanity.\" The approbation most welcome to\r\nJay was probably that of the eminent Chancellor Kent. \"I have read the\r\nvolume,\" he said, \"with equal interest and astonishment. You have\r\naccumulated a mass of facts of which a great part were to me unknown,\r\nand they are of a surprising kind. I do not well see how your argument\r\non any material point can be gainsaid. You have amply vindicated the\r\ncharacter and intentions of the American Antislavery Society from all\r\ninjurious imputations. The details of the slave-trade and its\r\naccompanying atrocities, as carried on at Washington, are horrible, and\r\nyour work must go far towards opening the eyes and disabusing the minds\r\nof the public. I have, from the very beginning, had doubts and\r\nmisgivings as to the efficacy and results of the American Colonization\r\nSociety, and for some years past I have become satisfied that the scheme\r\nwas in reality but an Utopian vision, though I had supposed until now\r\nthat its fruits were better. Permit me to add that I have been much\r\npleased, not only with the clearness, force, simplicity, and precision\r\nof the style, but with your fearless, frank, and manly, but courteous\r\nvindication of the cause of Truth and Justice, and with your striking\r\nappeals to the conscience and responsibilities of the Christian\r\nreader.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nCONTINUED EFFORTS TO SUPPRESS THE ANTISLAVERY MOVEMENT BY FORCE AND\r\n  INTIMIDATION.--FAVOURABLE EFFECT UPON THE PUBLIC MIND PRODUCED BY\r\n  JAY'S WRITINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second anniversary of the American Antislavery Society was held at\r\nthe Presbyterian Church at Houston and Thompson Streets in New York on\r\nthe 12th of May, 1835. James G. Birney, of Kentucky, George Thompson, of\r\nEngland, and William Lloyd Garrison made addresses. Judge Jay was\r\nappointed foreign corresponding secretary, and instructed to convey to\r\nthe Duc de Broglie, president of the French Society for the Abolition of\r\nSlavery, the sympathy of American abolitionists.\r\n\r\nThe increasing activity and strength of the antislavery movement were\r\nnot unnoticed by the partisans of the Slave Power, both North and South,\r\nand an incident occurred at Charleston, S. C., on the night of July\r\n29th, which illustrated the temper and methods of the party. The\r\nAmerican Antislavery Society had directed their publishers to forward a\r\nnumber of their periodical papers presenting facts and arguments on the\r\nsubject of slavery to various Southern gentlemen of distinction in the\r\nhope of inspiring a spirit of inquiry among persons of influence and\r\ncharacter. \"But it was precisely this spirit of inquiry,\" said Judge\r\nJay, \"that the advocates of perpetual bondage feared might be fatal to\r\ntheir favourite institution. Hence they affected to believe that the\r\npapers sent to the masters were intended to incite the slaves to\r\ninsurrection.\" The fact that a considerable number of antislavery\r\npublications had arrived at Charleston became known, and a mob broke\r\ninto the post-office and burned the mail in the streets. Arthur Tappan,\r\nWilliam L. Garrison, and Rev. Samuel H. Cox were burned in effigy. Mass\r\nmeetings were held at Charleston and Richmond to approve the action of\r\nthe mob, and aroused great excitement throughout the country. A\r\ncommittee was appointed at Charleston to take charge of the Northern\r\nmail on its arrival and to see that no antislavery papers should reach\r\ntheir destinations. The postmaster advised the postmaster-general that\r\nunder existing circumstances he had determined to suppress all\r\nantislavery publications, and asked for instructions. Amos Kendall,\r\nJackson's postmaster-general, whose sworn duty it was to preserve the\r\nsanctity of the mails, was only too willing to act as the tool of the\r\nSlave Power. \"We owe,\" he replied, \"an obligation to the laws, but a\r\nhigher one to the communities in which we live, and if the former be\r\nperverted to destroy the latter, it is patriotism to disregard them.\r\nEntertaining these views, I _cannot sanction and will not condemn the\r\nstep you have taken_.\" These novel and dangerous doctrines, by which the\r\nlaws of the republic were to be set aside by public officers for\r\npolitical purposes, received the sanction of President Jackson.\r\n\r\nThe postmaster at New York, Samuel L. Gouverneur, proposed to the\r\nAmerican Antislavery Society that it voluntarily desist from sending its\r\npublications by mail, but the Executive Committee properly refused to\r\nyield the legal rights which they possessed in common with their\r\nfellow-citizens. The postmaster announced that antislavery papers would\r\nnot be forwarded until further notice, and wrote to Washington for\r\ninstructions. Kendall replied that he was \"deterred from giving an order\r\nto exclude the whole series of antislavery publications from the\r\nSouthern mail only by a want of legal power.\" Such a power, he admitted,\r\nvested in the head of the post-office department, would be fearfully\r\ndangerous and had been withheld properly; but he added, with more regard\r\nto the public opinion of the moment than to the principles of the\r\nConstitution, \"If I were situated as you are, I would do as you have\r\ndone.\" Some members of the Executive Committee wished to test the action\r\nof the New York postmaster in the United States courts, but Judge Jay\r\nopposed the plan for reasons which he gave in a letter to Elizur Wright,\r\nJr.: \"The action must be brought and tried in the city of New York--in\r\nthat city in which this same gentleman, after his offence had been\r\npublicly proclaimed by himself in the newspapers, addressed thousands of\r\nthe citizens in the Park and was received by their applause. Nor is this\r\nall. His conduct is commended by his superior, who is a member of the\r\nPresident's cabinet and probably acts with the approbation of General\r\nJackson. Under such circumstances, I think it improbable that a\r\nprosecution would be attended with any result beneficial to our cause.\r\nWe have not surrendered our rights, but they have been violently wrested\r\nfrom us.... _Festina lente_ is sometimes a safe maxim. Fidelity to our\r\nprinciples and prudence in our conduct will, in time, through the\r\nblessing of God, crown our labours with success. You think it is hardly\r\nto be supposed that the people of the North are willing to give up the\r\nright of the post-office. Certainly they are not willing to give up\r\ntheir own, but they are willing _at present_ to give up _our_ right to\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nThe South, recognizing the growing strength of antislavery opinion,\r\nbegan its appeals to the North to save the Union by suppressing the\r\nabolitionists. A public meeting in Virginia requested that this might be\r\ndone \"by strong yet lawful, by mild yet constitutional means\"--terms\r\nwhich recalled the inquisitor of the Holy Office handing over condemned\r\nheretics to the executioner with the ironical request that he would\r\ndeal with them tenderly and without blood-letting. In deference to the\r\nSlave Power the post-office had been made to nullify the freedom of the\r\npress, and freedom of speech was now to be suppressed, if possible, by\r\nmob violence. The situation of abolitionists in this year may be\r\ninferred from letters written from Brooklyn during the summer by Mrs.\r\nLydia Maria Child: \"I have not ventured into the city, nor does one of\r\nus dare to go to church to-day, so great is the excitement here. You can\r\nform no conception of it. 'Tis like the times of the French Revolution,\r\nwhen no man dared trust his neighbour. Private assassins from New\r\nOrleans are lurking at the corners of the streets to stab Arthur Tappan;\r\nand very large sums are offered for any one who will get Mr. George\r\nThompson into the slave States. I tremble for him. He is almost a close\r\nprisoner in his chamber, his friends deeming him in eminent peril the\r\nmoment it is ascertained where he is.... Five thousand dollars were\r\noffered on the Exchange in New York for the head of Arthur Tappan on\r\nFriday last. Elizur Wright is barricading his house with shutters, bars,\r\nand bolts. Judge Jay has been with us two or three days. He is as firm\r\nas the everlasting hills.\"\r\n\r\nThe popular feeling against the abolitionists was growing daily, and\r\nfrom every quarter they were charged with \"unconstitutional,\r\ninsurrectionary, and diabolical designs.\" To attempt to disabuse the\r\ncommunity of the false impressions received from pro-slavery speakers\r\nand newspapers seemed the most important duty at this time. The\r\nfollowing anonymous letter, signed \"A Returning Southerner,\" was\r\nreceived by Arthur Tappan, and placed the necessity for such action in a\r\nstrong light:\r\n\r\n  \"Though we are unknown to each other, yet the friendship I feel for\r\n  you induces me to address you. I have been where you have not, and\r\n  have heard what you have not, and believe that great prudence is\r\n  requisite on your part. I do not ask you to remit your philanthropic\r\n  efforts. Heaven and future ages, if not the present, will appreciate\r\n  them.\r\n\r\n  \"I do not pretend to advise, but have often thought that you and\r\n  your friends do not take sufficient means to disabuse the public of\r\n  the ceaseless charges of a multitude of papers.\r\n\r\n  \"A vast majority in this city have never seen one of your papers,\r\n  and countless multitudes, not only here but through our vast\r\n  republic, believe without a doubt, for they have seen it unceasingly\r\n  asserted and never contradicted, that you ardently wish your\r\n  incendiary publications to excite the slaves to rebellion and\r\n  bloodshed, massacre and rapine in their worst forms. While this\r\n  impression is so common, or rather so universal, I was glad to see\r\n  in circulation, as tending in some measure to your safety and the\r\n  safety of this association, that you address not the slave but his\r\n  master--a fact well enough known by your vengeance-seeking foes, but\r\n  not known by those whom they intend to use as instruments of\r\n  violence. I only presume further to suggest a card, to be inserted\r\n  at least a week in the _Courier and Inquirer_, stating in brief\r\n  terms that you do not advocate the violence imputed to you; that you\r\n  address the reason of white men, not the passions of slaves.\"\r\n\r\nThe Executive Committee of the American Antislavery Society resolved to\r\nask Judge Jay to prepare such a statement as the crisis called for. Jay\r\nwas on a tour through the White Mountains at the time, but immediately\r\non his return he prepared the following address, which was published in\r\nSeptember, 1835, and was widely circulated in America and Europe:\r\n\r\n  \"_To the Public._\r\n\r\n  \"In behalf of the American Antislavery Society we solicit the candid\r\n  attention of the public to the following declaration of our\r\n  principles and objects. Were the charges which are brought against\r\n  us made only by persons who are interested in the continuance of\r\n  slavery, and by such as are influenced solely by unworthy motives,\r\n  this address would be unnecessary; but there are those who merit and\r\n  possess our esteem, who would not voluntarily do us injustice, and\r\n  who have been led by gross misrepresentations to believe that we are\r\n  pursuing measures at variance not only with the constitutional\r\n  rights of the South but with the precepts of humanity and religion.\r\n  To such we offer the following explanations and assurances:\r\n\r\n  \"1st. We hold that Congress has no more right to abolish slavery in\r\n  the Southern States than in the French West India Islands. Of course\r\n  we desire no national legislation on the subject.\r\n\r\n  \"2d. We hold that slavery cannot be lawfully abolished except by the\r\n  Legislatures of the several States in which it prevails, and that\r\n  the exercise of any other than moral influence to induce such\r\n  abolition is unconstitutional.\r\n\r\n  \"3d. We believe that Congress has the same right to abolish slavery\r\n  in the District of Columbia that the State governments have within\r\n  their respective jurisdictions, and that it is their duty to efface\r\n  so foul a spot from the national escutcheon.\r\n\r\n  \"4th. We believe the American citizens have the right to express and\r\n  publish their opinions of the constitutions, laws, and institutions\r\n  of any and every State and nation under heaven; and we mean\r\n  never to surrender the liberty of speech, of the press, or of\r\n  conscience--blessings we have inherited from our fathers, and which\r\n  we intend, so far as we are able, to transmit unimpaired to our\r\n  children.\r\n\r\n  \"5th. We have uniformly deprecated all forcible attempts on the part\r\n  of the slaves to recover their liberty; and were it in our power to\r\n  address them we would exhort them to observe a quiet and peaceful\r\n  demeanour, and would assure them that no insurrectionary movement on\r\n  their part would receive from us the slightest aid or countenance.\r\n\r\n  \"6th. We would deplore any servile insurrection, both on account of\r\n  the calamities which would attend it and on account of the occasion\r\n  which it would furnish of increased severity and oppression.\r\n\r\n  \"7th. We are charged with sending incendiary publications to the\r\n  South. If by the term 'incendiary' is meant publications containing\r\n  arguments and facts to prove slavery to be a moral and political\r\n  evil, and that duty and policy require its immediate abolition, the\r\n  charge is true. But if this term is used to imply publications\r\n  encouraging insurrection and designed to excite the slaves to break\r\n  their fetters, the charge is utterly and unequivocally false. We beg\r\n  our fellow-citizens to notice that this charge is made without\r\n  proof, and by many who confess that they have never read our\r\n  publications, and that those who make it offer to the public no\r\n  evidence from our writings in support of it.\r\n\r\n  \"8th. We are accused of sending our publications to the slaves, and\r\n  it is asserted that their tendency is to excite insurrections. Both\r\n  the charges are false. These publications are not intended for the\r\n  slaves, and were they able to read them, they would find in them no\r\n  encouragement to insurrection.\r\n\r\n  \"9th. We are accused of employing agents in the slave States to\r\n  distribute our publications. We have never had one such agent. We\r\n  have sent no packages of our papers to any person in those States\r\n  for distribution, except to five respectable resident citizens at\r\n  their own request. But we have sent by mail single papers addressed\r\n  to public officers, editors of newspapers, and clergymen. If,\r\n  therefore, our object is to excite the slaves to insurrection, the\r\n  masters are our agents!\r\n\r\n  \"10th. We believe slavery to be sinful, injurious to this and to\r\n  every other country in which it prevails; we believe immediate\r\n  emancipation to be the duty of every slaveholder, and that the\r\n  immediate abolition of slavery, by those who have the right to\r\n  abolish it, would be safe and wise. These opinions we have freely\r\n  expressed, and we certainly have no intention to refrain from\r\n  expressing them in future, and urging them upon the consciences and\r\n  hearts of our fellow-citizens who hold slaves or apologize for\r\n  slavery.\r\n\r\n  \"11th. We believe that the education of the poor is required by\r\n  duty, and by a regard for the permanency of our republican\r\n  institutions. There are thousands and tens of thousands of our\r\n  fellow-citizens, even in the free States, sunk in abject poverty,\r\n  and who, on account of their complexion, are virtually kept in\r\n  ignorance, and whose instruction in certain cases is actually\r\n  prohibited by law. We are anxious to protect the rights and to\r\n  promote the virtue and happiness of the coloured portion of our\r\n  population, and on this account we have been charged with a design\r\n  to encourage intermarriage between the whites and the blacks. This\r\n  charge has been repeatedly and is now again denied; while we repeat\r\n  that the tendency of our sentiments is to put an end to the criminal\r\n  amalgamation that prevails wherever slavery exists.\r\n\r\n  \"12th. We are accused of acts that tend to a dissolution of the\r\n  Union, and even of wishing to dissolve it. We have never 'calculated\r\n  the value of the Union,' because we believe it to be inestimable,\r\n  and that the abolition of slavery will remove the chief danger of\r\n  its dissolution; and one of the many reasons why we endeavour to\r\n  preserve the Constitution is that it restrains Congress from making\r\n  any law 'abridging the freedom of speech or of the press.'\r\n\r\n  \"Such, fellow-citizens, are our principles. Are they unworthy of\r\n  Christians and of republicans? Or are they in truth so atrocious\r\n  that in order to prevent their diffusion you are yourselves willing\r\n  to surrender at the dictation of others the invaluable privilege of\r\n  free discussion, the very birthright of Americans? Will you, in\r\n  order that the abominations of slavery may be concealed from public\r\n  view, and that the capital of your republic may continue to be as it\r\n  now is, under the sanction of Congress, the great slave-mart of the\r\n  American continent, consent that the general government, in\r\n  acknowledged defiance of the Constitution and laws, shall appoint\r\n  throughout the length and breadth of your land ten thousand censors\r\n  of the press, each of whom shall have the right to inspect every\r\n  document you may commit to the post-office, and to suppress every\r\n  pamphlet and newspaper, whether religious or political, which in his\r\n  sovereign pleasure he may adjudge to contain an incendiary article?\r\n  Surely we need not remind you that if you submit to such an\r\n  encroachment on your liberties the days of our republic are\r\n  numbered, and that although abolitionists may be the first, they\r\n  will not be the last victims offered at the shrine of arbitrary\r\n  power.\r\n\r\n  \"(Signed)\r\n\r\n    \"ARTHUR TAPPAN,\r\n    \"JOHN RANKIN,\r\n    \"WILLIAM JAY,\r\n    \"ELIZUR WRIGHT, JR.,\r\n    \"ABRAHAM L. COX,\r\n    \"LEWIS TAPPAN,\r\n    \"JOSHUA LEAVITT,\r\n    \"SAMUEL E. CORNISH,\r\n    \"SIMEON S. JOCELIN,\r\n    \"THEODORE S. WRIGHT.\r\n\r\n  \"NEW YORK, September 3d, 1835.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of Jay's address to the public was thus described by Elizur\r\nWright, Jr.: \"The Southern papers are copying it extensively, and most\r\nof them charge us with having disclaimed in it our real motives--a proof\r\nthat our real sentiments were before misunderstood. In a large number of\r\nNorthern papers it is copied with more or less approbation. Indeed, none\r\nbut the determined pro-slavery presses fail to speak of it as a candid,\r\nfirm, and honourable if not convincing document.\" \"It has had a most\r\nbeneficial effect,\" wrote Lewis Tappan. \"What a contrast to the\r\nebullition of public meetings!\"\r\n\r\nA movement was begun in the year 1835, on the part of the Southern press\r\nand Southern Legislatures to induce penal legislation in the North\r\nagainst the expression of antislavery sentiments. The _Richmond Whig_\r\nrevealed its opinion of its Northern allies when it said: \"Depend upon\r\nit, the Northern people will never sacrifice their lucrative trade with\r\nthe South so long as the hanging of a few thousands will prevent it.\" In\r\nobedience to these demands, pro-slavery men in the North were actually\r\nto be found proposing legislation intended to destroy the freedom of the\r\npress and to make antislavery expression a criminal offence. Judge Jay\r\ntook occasion to meet this movement in a charge which he delivered to\r\nthe Westchester Grand Jury, in which he said: \"Any law which might be\r\npassed to abridge in the slightest degree the freedom of speech or of\r\nthe press, or to shield any one subject from discussion, would be\r\nutterly null and void; and it would be the duty of every genuine\r\nrepublican to resist with energy and decision so palpable an outrage on\r\nthe declared will of the people.\" These remarks were widely published\r\nand did much to discourage the pro-slavery agitators.\r\n\r\nBut other illegitimate and violent schemes to reduce to silence\r\nantislavery men were soon brought into play. South Carolina having\r\ninaugurated the assault upon the constitutional rights of the North\r\nthrough the post-office, Alabama followed in a yet bolder step against\r\nthe personal security of abolitionists. Governor Gayle, of that State,\r\ndemanded of the Governor of New York that Ransom G. Williams, the\r\npublishing agent of the Antislavery Society, should be surrendered to\r\nhim to be tried under the laws of Alabama on an indictment found\r\nagainst him by the Grand Jury for publishing in the _Emancipator_, in\r\nthe city of New York, the following sentiment: \"God commands and all\r\nnature cries out that man should not be held as property. The system of\r\nmaking men property has plunged two and a quarter millions of our\r\nfellow-countrymen into the deepest physical and moral degradation, and\r\nthey are every moment sinking deeper.\" This expression was the most\r\noffensive which the Alabama Grand Jury could discover in the documents\r\nof the society on which to base the indictment and demand, and as the\r\none which came nearest to anything resembling an attempt to incite the\r\nslaves to insurrection. Williams had never been in the State of Alabama,\r\nwas never subject to its laws, had never fled from its jurisdiction, and\r\nthese facts were admitted by the Governor when he made requisition for\r\nWilliams as a \"fugitive from justice.\" While the American Antislavery\r\nSociety was considering what action it should take for the protection of\r\nits agent, Lewis Tappan wrote to Judge Jay (8th September) suggesting\r\nthat he should get the opinion of two or three eminent lawyers on the\r\nsubject to be circulated by the society. Jay replied: \"The Southern\r\npapers have intimated that Northern abolitionists may be indicted in the\r\ncourts and then demanded of the State executives, and you request my\r\nopinion whether it would be advisable to obtain and publish the legal\r\nopinion of eminent counsel on this novel doctrine. The doctrine is so\r\nmonstrous, so utterly at variance with all our ideas of constitutional\r\nand State rights, that it shocks the understanding and moral sense of\r\nthe community, and I verily believe that there is not one Northern\r\ngovernor who would dare to arrest a citizen on such a demand. But if we\r\nmanifest alarm at this doctrine and get lawyers to controvert it, there\r\nwill be found rival presses, venal lawyers, and corrupt politicians to\r\nsupport the other side of the question; the community will begin to\r\ndiscuss the subject, passion and interest and prejudice will believe\r\nwhatever they want to believe. My opinion, therefore, is that the less\r\nwe say on this subject the better, and that we should not give a\r\nfactitious importance to the doctrine.\" Jay's advice was followed and\r\nproved to be wise. Governor Marcy could do nothing but refuse the\r\nrequest of Governor Gayle, although he softened his refusal by abuse of\r\nthe abolitionists.\r\n\r\nUnder the leadership of Alvan Stewart a convention was called to meet at\r\nUtica on October 21, 1835, to form a New York State Antislavery Society.\r\nAbout six hundred delegates were present. The spirit of mob violence,\r\nwhich was being encouraged by pro-slavery orators and presses throughout\r\nthe country to suppress the abolitionists by force, was relied upon to\r\nprevent the meeting of the convention. The mob having occupied in\r\nadvance the room in the court-house prepared for the meeting, the\r\ndelegates repaired to a Presbyterian Church, where they had barely\r\nenough time to organize and elect officers before the riotous\r\nsupporters of slavery broke into the church and violently dispersed the\r\nconvention. The lawless tyranny to which the delegates were subjected\r\nand their courageous conduct attracted to their cause many persons who\r\nhad held aloof hitherto. Chief among these was Gerrit Smith, who from\r\nthis time gave to the antislavery movement unstinted contributions of\r\nmoney and intelligent labour. Judge Jay, notwithstanding his unavoidable\r\nabsence from the convention, was elected president of the society then\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nAt about the same time as the Utica riots occurred the mobbing of\r\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison, in Boston, by \"gentlemen of property and\r\nstanding.\" And all over the North were enacted scenes of violence,\r\nencouraged by a large portion of the press, which were intended to\r\ngratify the Southern demand that abolitionism should be put down at all\r\nhazards. The sanctity of the mails, the constitutional right of free\r\nspeech and of lawful assemblage, were forgotten by a large portion of\r\nthe people. And they were forgotten by the President of the United\r\nStates himself. In December, 1835, Andrew Jackson, in his message to\r\nCongress, gave a tacit approval to mob rule, to the suppression of the\r\nfreedom of the press, and to the oft-exposed falsehood that the\r\nabolitionists distributed documents among the slaves intended to incite\r\nthem to insurrection; and he recommended the closing of the mails to\r\nantislavery people.\r\n\r\nThe position taken by President Jackson was so unjust, so\r\nunconstitutional, and so calculated to aggravate the situation, that the\r\nAmerican Antislavery Society determined to make an official reply to it.\r\nJudge Jay was chosen to answer the President on behalf of the society,\r\nand he prepared an address which was signed by all the officers. This\r\ndocument was a complete exposure of the falsity of the charges made and\r\nof the unlawfulness of the restrictive measures which Jackson proposed\r\nto Congress.\r\n\r\n  \"You have accused,\" said Jay, \"an indefinite number of your\r\n  fellow-citizens, without designation of name or residence, of making\r\n  unconstitutional and wicked efforts, and of harbouring intentions\r\n  which could be entertained only by the most depraved and abandoned\r\n  of mankind; and yet you carefully abstain from averring _which_\r\n  article of the Constitution they have transgressed; you omit stating\r\n  when, where, and by whom these wicked attempts were made; you give\r\n  no specification of the inflammatory appeals which you assert have\r\n  been addressed to the passions of the slaves. You well know that\r\n  the 'moral influence' of your charges will affect thousands and\r\n  tens of thousands of your countrymen, many of them your\r\n  political friends--some of them heretofore honoured with your\r\n  confidence--most, if not all of them, of irreproachable character;\r\n  and yet, by the very vagueness of your charges, you incapacitate\r\n  each one of this multitude from proving his innocence.... It is\r\n  deserving of notice that the _attempt_ to circulate our papers is\r\n  alone charged upon us. It is not pretended that we have put our\r\n  appeals into the hands of a single slave, or that in any instance\r\n  our endeavours to excite a servile war have been crowned with\r\n  success. And in what way was our most execrable attempt made? By\r\n  secret agents, traversing the slave country in disguise, stealing by\r\n  night into the hut of the slave, and reading to him our inflammatory\r\n  appeals? You, sir, answer this question by declaring that we\r\n  attempted the mighty mischief by circulating our appeals _through\r\n  the mails_! And are the Southern slaves, sir, accustomed to receive\r\n  periodicals by mail? Of the thousands of publications mailed from\r\n  the antislavery office for the South, did you ever hear, sir, of one\r\n  solitary paper being addressed to a slave? Would you know to whom\r\n  they were directed, consult the Southern newspapers, and you will\r\n  find them complaining that they were sent to public officers,\r\n  clergymen, and other influential citizens. Thus, it seems, we are\r\n  incendiaries who place the torch in the hands of him whose dwelling\r\n  we would fire! We are conspiring to incite a servile war, and\r\n  announce our design to the masters and commit to their care and\r\n  disposal the very instruments by which we expect to effect our\r\n  purpose!... To repel your charges and to disabuse the public was a\r\n  duty we owed to ourselves, to our children, and, above all, to the\r\n  great and holy cause in which we are engaged. That cause we believe\r\n  is approved by our Maker; and while we retain this belief, it is our\r\n  intention, trusting to His direction and protection, to persevere in\r\n  our endeavours to impress upon the minds and hearts of our\r\n  countrymen the sinfulness of claiming property in human beings, and\r\n  the duty and wisdom of immediately relinquishing it. When convinced\r\n  that our endeavours are wrong, we shall abandon them, but such\r\n  conviction must be produced by other arguments than vituperation,\r\n  popular violence, or penal enactments.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1836 Judge Jay resigned the presidency of the New York State\r\nAntislavery Society. The distance of his home from the headquarters of\r\nthe society made the office nearly nominal, and he thought that it\r\nshould be filled by a person more favourably situated for usefulness.\r\n\"We commenced the present struggle,\" he wrote in his letter of\r\nresignation, \"to obtain the freedom of the slave; we are compelled to\r\ncontinue it to preserve our own. We are now contending, not so much with\r\nthe slaveholders of the South about human rights, as with the political\r\nand commercial aristocracy of the North, for the liberty of speech, of\r\nthe press, and of conscience. Our politicians are selling our\r\nconstitutions and laws for Southern votes. Our great capitalists are\r\nspeculating, not merely in land and banks, but in the liberties of the\r\npeople. We are called to contemplate a spectacle never, I believe,\r\nbefore witnessed--the wealthy portion of the community striving to\r\nintroduce anarchy and violence on a calculation of profit; making\r\nmerchandise of peace and good order! In Boston we have seen the editor\r\nof a newspaper led through the streets with a halter by gentlemen 'of\r\nproperty and standing.' The New York mobs were excited, not by the\r\nhumble penny press, but by the malignant falsehood and insurrectionary\r\nappeals of certain commercial journals. Rich and honourable men in\r\nCincinnati have recently at a public meeting proclaimed lynch law, and\r\nthrough their influence a printing-press devoted to freedom has been\r\ndestroyed, and the whole affair, we are coolly and most truly told,\r\nwas a _business transaction_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: William Jay]\r\n\r\n\"... It cannot be, it is not in human nature that judges and lawyers and\r\nrich merchants will long enjoy the exclusive privileges of trampling on\r\nthe laws. These men are sowing the wind and they will reap the\r\nwhirlwind. They may see the buddings of their harvest in the recent\r\nassaults upon the Holland Land Company. When the tempest of anarchy they\r\nare now raising shall sweep over the land it will not be the humble\r\nabolitionist, but the lofty possessor of power and fortune, who will\r\nfirst be levelled by the blast.... The obligations of religion and of\r\npatriotism; the duties we owe to ourselves, to our children, the cause\r\nof freedom, and the cause of humanity--all require us to be faithful to\r\nour principles, to persevere in our exertions, and to surrender our\r\nrights only with our breath. Duties are ours and consequences are God's,\r\nand while we discharge the first we may be confident that the latter\r\nwill be entirely consistent with our true welfare.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nGRADUAL DECLINE OF RIOTOUS DEMONSTRATIONS AGAINST THE\r\n  ABOLITIONISTS.--CHANGES OCCUR IN THE DOCTRINES AND METHODS OF THE\r\n  AMERICAN ANTISLAVERY SOCIETY.--JUDGE JAY RESIGNS HIS MEMBERSHIP,\r\n  WHILE CONTINUING HIS EFFORTS ON BEHALF OF EMANCIPATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe effort to suppress the antislavery movement by force, which was\r\ncarried on by Northern people at the instigation of the South, continued\r\nthrough the years 1837 and 1838. The incidents which attracted the most\r\nattention were the murder of Lovejoy at Alton and the burning of\r\nPennsylvania Hall in Philadelphia by a mob. By assassination and arson a\r\nconsiderable portion of the American people sought to destroy the right\r\nto free speech and free assemblage guaranteed by the American\r\nConstitution and cherished hitherto as a birthright. The right of free\r\ndiscussion, wrote Alexander H. Everett at the time, \"is not only\r\nendangered, but for the present, at least, is actually lost.\" \"The\r\nnewspapers of every day,\" he continued, \"bring to our view the account\r\nof some new case in which a printing-press has been seized and thrown\r\ninto the river; a public meeting broken up; a citizen tarred and\r\nfeathered, scourged--too often, I add with horror, put to a violent\r\ndeath by a lawless mob for no other cause or crime than the free\r\ndiscussion of the subject of slavery.\" The impunity with which these\r\ncrimes were committed, the connivance or leniency of the authorities\r\nwhose sworn duty it was to uphold the laws, made this time a critical\r\none for the security of American liberties. In pursuing their lawful\r\ncourse undaunted through this \"reign of terror,\" when so large a portion\r\nof their fellow-countrymen seemed to have forgotten the obligations of\r\ncitizens to established law, the abolitionists not only maintained the\r\nexistence of their cause, but they preserved those rights which\r\nAmericans value above all others. That free speech continued to exist in\r\nthe United States was duo to their indomitable courage. Such a state of\r\naffairs could not endure long. Lawless feeling exhausted itself in\r\nfruitless violence. Antislavery societies increased in numbers and\r\nmembership. Comparative order and toleration gradually displaced the\r\ndisgraceful passions which had placed the liberties of the country in\r\nhazard.\r\n\r\nAs opposition diminished and their path became easier, abolitionists\r\nbegan to differ among themselves as to the best means to attain their\r\nends and as to the fundamental principles of their cause. In New York\r\nState a tendency was developed, under the leadership of Gerrit Smith, to\r\nadopt political methods. In Boston moral agitation remained the accepted\r\nmeans. But here novel theories on other subjects were being adopted by\r\nleading antislavery people and thus associated in the public mind with\r\nantislavery itself. Garrison adopted and recommended in the _Liberator_\r\nhis no-government and non-resistance doctrines. He put forth new and not\r\ngenerally accepted views regarding the observance of Sunday. He took\r\npains to declare that he adopted these theories in his private capacity,\r\nand not as an abolitionist. But he had many followers who did not\r\ndiscriminate so carefully. The public mind became confused and began to\r\nassociate abolitionism with a variety of novel and unpopular opinions.\r\nThe cause was thus obstructed and divisions occurred among those who\r\nlaboured for the emancipation of the negro. Up to this time women had\r\nnot taken part in public meetings, and to many persons the idea of their\r\ndoing so was repugnant. The admission of women to membership and office\r\nin the same societies as men was determined in Boston in 1838, after a\r\nstruggle and amidst much objection.\r\n\r\n\"I have observed,\" wrote Jay in a private letter in 1838, \"frequent\r\nattempts to use abolition as a pack-horse to carry forth into the world\r\nsome favourite notion having no legitimate connection with the\r\nantislavery cause; and have witnessed the dissensions caused in our\r\nranks by such inconsiderate and dishonest assumptions. Thus I have known\r\nan official document, under the signature of a secretary of a State\r\nsociety, pass a high eulogium on a particular form of Church government;\r\nand I have seen an editorial article in an official antislavery\r\nperiodical recommending a decoction of dried currants as a substitute\r\nfor the fermented juice of the grape in the observance of the Lord's\r\nSupper! All such perversions of antislavery influence appear to me to be\r\ndishonest in their character, and dangerous in their consequences to the\r\ncontinuance and efficiency of our organization. No one is more strenuous\r\nthan myself for the right of opinion and discussion; but common justice\r\nand fairness require that we should not make others responsible for our\r\npeculiar opinions, nor seek to propagate them by means entrusted to us\r\nfor very different purposes.\r\n\r\n\"The practice of passing numerous resolutions at our antislavery\r\nmeetings strikes me as a growing and pernicious evil. Too many seem to\r\nthink that all our objects are to be effected by resolutions; and amid\r\nthe vast multitude that are proposed and adopted with little reflection,\r\nit is not surprising, yet deeply to be deplored, that some are false _in\r\nfact_, more false in sentiment, and very many coarse and vulgar in\r\nexpression. Falsehood is not the less immoral for being employed in a\r\ngood cause, and it is very unwise to impair the charms of Truth by\r\narraying her in vulgar attire. It is to be wished that our meetings may\r\nin future be less prodigal of their resolutions, and more circumspect as\r\nto the matter and language.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Jay looked with dismay upon the novel doctrines on other subjects\r\nwhich were becoming associated with antislavery in the public mind. He\r\ndeplored the loss of strength which must result from a departure from\r\nthe singleness of purpose announced in the declaration of principles at\r\nthe founding of the American Antislavery Society. And there were\r\ndifferences of opinion arising on the fundamental principles of the\r\ncause which troubled him still more. As has been shown in these pages,\r\nhe had joined the American Antislavery Society only after a deliberate\r\nexamination of its constitution and the conviction that its principles\r\nwere in strict accordance with the Constitution of the United States. He\r\nwas as strong an advocate of emancipation as lived, but to him the\r\nConstitution was the supreme law under which all benefits could be and\r\nmust be obtained. Efforts to seek the abolition of slavery by arguments\r\nor conduct in violation of the Constitution seemed to him wicked in\r\nthemselves and fatal to the cause. Such efforts he had now to combat.\r\n\r\nAt the sixth anniversary of the Massachusetts Antislavery Society, held\r\nin January, 1838, the business committee, composed of Messrs. Garrison,\r\nPhelps, May, and Fairbanks, reported the following resolution:\r\n\r\n  \"_Resolved_, That in order to bring our coloured friends within the\r\n  brotherhood of this nation, we will encourage them in petitioning to\r\n  Congress, in their own names, for the redress of their grievances,\r\n  and, if not successful, then we will lend them our aid in bringing\r\n  their cause before the court of the United States to ascertain if a\r\n  man can be held in bondage agreeably to the principles contained in\r\n  the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution of our country.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Jay wrote a letter to Mr. Ellis Gray Loring, March 5th, asking for\r\nmore definite information as to the true intent of the society in\r\npassing the resolution.\r\n\r\n  \"Who are the _coloured friends_ alluded to?\" he asked. \"Obviously\r\n  _slaves_, because if Congress does not redress their grievances,\r\n  then the society is to lead them into the court of the United States\r\n  to ascertain whether a man can be held in _bondage_.\r\n\r\n  \"What grievances are the slaves, under the encouragement of the\r\n  society, to petition Congress to redress? Obviously those they\r\n  suffer as slaves, because if Congress does not redress them, redress\r\n  is to be sought in the court, by demanding if a man can be held in\r\n  _bondage_, that is, as a slave.\r\n\r\n  \"What slaves are intended by the resolution? No qualification or\r\n  limitation whatever is expressed or implied. The Society, no doubt,\r\n  recognizes the slaves of Georgia as its coloured friends as well as\r\n  the slaves of the District of Columbia. The resolution is the tenth\r\n  of a series of resolutions reported by the committee, and in none of\r\n  them is any mention made of the District of Columbia, and, moreover,\r\n  the question to be decided by the court is not whether an inhabitant\r\n  of the District can be held as a slave, but whether a man can be\r\n  held in bondage agreeably to the principles of the Declaration of\r\n  Independence and the Constitution of our country, and the tribunal\r\n  to decide this question is not the court of the District but the\r\n  court of the United States.\r\n\r\n  \"Members of Congress take an oath to support the Constitution of\r\n  the United States. If, therefore, the society believe the\r\n  Constitution does not authorize Congress to redress the grievances\r\n  of its coloured friends, it has pledged itself to encourage those\r\n  friends to petition Congress to commit perjury. Hence it appears to\r\n  me that the true meaning of this resolution, expressed in plain\r\n  language, is, '_Resolved_, That in our opinion Congress possesses\r\n  the constitutional power to abolish slavery throughout the United\r\n  States, and that we will encourage the slaves to petition Congress\r\n  for an act of emancipation, and should no such an act be passed we\r\n  will aid them in suing for their freedom in the Supreme Court of the\r\n  United States.'\r\n\r\n  \"It is to be regretted that the society did not announce the means\r\n  they intend to employ to encourage the slaves to send petitions to\r\n  Congress. The pledge has been solemnly given. Is it to be redeemed\r\n  by sending among them secret or avowed agents? It is singular also\r\n  that if the society believes the 'court of the United States' can\r\n  give liberty to the slaves, it should not make an _immediate_\r\n  application for its beneficent interposition, but should resolve to\r\n  postpone such application not only until it has succeeded in\r\n  prompting them to petition Congress for a redress of their\r\n  grievances, but also until a sufficient time has elapsed to learn\r\n  the result of this moral experiment. Permit me now, sir, to call\r\n  your attention to the past professions of some of the gentlemen who\r\n  reported this resolution, and of the society which adopted it.\r\n\r\n  \"On the 4th December, 1833, Messrs. Phelps, Garrison, and May, as\r\n  members of the Philadelphia Convention, signed the following\r\n  declaration: 'We fully and unanimously recognize the sovereignty of\r\n  _each State to legislate exclusively_ on the subject of slavery\r\n  which is tolerated within its limits. We concede that Congress has\r\n  no _right to interfere_ with any slave State in relation to the\r\n  momentous subject.'\r\n\r\n  \"Mr. Garrison afterwards, in an editorial article in the\r\n  _Liberator_, thus expresses himself: 'Abolitionists as clearly\r\n  understand and as sacredly regard the constitutional powers of\r\n  Congress as do their traducers, and they know, and have again and\r\n  again asserted, that Congress has _no more rightful authority to sit\r\n  in judgment upon Southern slavery than it has to legislate for the\r\n  abolition of slavery in the French colonies_.'\r\n\r\n  \"On the 17th of August, 1835, at a meeting of the Massachusetts\r\n  Antislavery Society, duly held in Boston, an address to the public\r\n  was adopted, professing to set forth the _true principles and\r\n  objects_ of the society; and to give this statement a stronger claim\r\n  to the confidence of the community it was authenticated by the\r\n  signatures of _thirty-one_ of the principal officers and members of\r\n  the society, including _your own_ and those of three of the\r\n  committee who reported the late resolution, viz., Messrs. Garrison,\r\n  May, and Fairbanks. The opinion of the society at that time on the\r\n  power of Congress was in that document thus explicitly stated: 'We\r\n  fully acknowledge that no change in the slave laws of the Southern\r\n  States can be made unless by the Southern Legislatures. Neither\r\n  Congress nor the Legislatures of the free States have authority _to\r\n  change the condition_ of a single slave in the slave States.' Yet\r\n  the society now stands prepared to encourage the slaves to petition\r\n  Congress for a redress of their grievances! And now, sir, the object\r\n  of this letter is to ascertain whether the resolution I have quoted\r\n  does in truth represent the present opinion held by your society on\r\n  the power of Congress, or whether the resolution was intended to be\r\n  confined to slaves in the District of Columbia and the territory of\r\n  Florida.\r\n\r\n  \"It cannot be necessary to dwell on the vast importance of an\r\n  explicit declaration by your board on this subject. Independent of\r\n  the deep concern I feel in the harmony, integrity, and consistency\r\n  of the abolition party, I have a personal interest in the inquiry I\r\n  now make of you. An _enlarged_ edition of my book is ready for the\r\n  press, but the late resolution of your society compels me to suspend\r\n  its publication. I had treated the charge that abolitionists desired\r\n  Congress to interfere with slavery in the States as calumnious, and\r\n  in refutation of it had appealed to their solemn disclaimers. I need\r\n  not say, sir, that until the late resolution is satisfactorily\r\n  explained, or its doctrine disavowed by your society, I cannot in my\r\n  new edition deny the charge, but must as an honest man substitute\r\n  for my confident assertions and triumphant appeals most painful and\r\n  humiliating confessions. Permit me to suggest that it is highly\r\n  desirable that your board should act explicitly on this subject\r\n  before the meeting of the American Antislavery Society, that, if\r\n  possible, no inquiries or investigation may then arise to mar the\r\n  harmony of the meeting and retard the progress of abolition.\r\n\r\n  \"I flatter myself, sir, that your sentiments on the constitutional\r\n  question remain the same as when you signed the address of 1835, and\r\n  that you comprehend and appreciate the motives which have prompted\r\n  this letter. I shall await your answer with extreme anxiety.\"\r\n\r\nOn receipt of this letter Mr. Loring communicated with a number of the\r\nmembers of the board of managers and endeavoured to hold a meeting of\r\nthe board for the purpose of rescinding or repudiating the resolution;\r\nbut it was not until the 14th that he succeeded in getting a quorum\r\ntogether. After Mr. Loring had read Judge Jay's letter to the board,\r\nthey promptly passed the following resolution:\r\n\r\n  \"_Resolved_, That as said resolution was submitted to the meeting\r\n  just at its close, when but few delegates were present, and was\r\n  adopted without deliberation or discussion, this board recommend its\r\n  reconsideration at the next quarterly meeting of the society.\r\n\r\n  _\"Resolved_, As the sense of this board, that Congress has no power\r\n  to abolish slavery in the several States of this Union.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated the 15th of March, enclosing a copy of the above\r\nresolution, Mr. Loring said: \"I can hear of but one or two persons here\r\nwho believe in the power of Congress over slavery in the States, viz.,\r\nthe Misses Grimke, Mr. Alanson St. Clair, and perhaps Mr. May and Mrs.\r\nChapman. Several, however, and those influential persons (Mr. Garrison\r\namong them), think slavery unconstitutional, and believe it would be so\r\npronounced by the Supreme Court of the United States if the point should\r\never be made. In this opinion I can by no means agree.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"unfortunate resolution,\" he continued, was offered by a \"silly\r\nofficious person\" at a moment of much haste and confusion just as the\r\nmeeting was breaking up, and had been approved without proper\r\nconsideration by the committee whose duty it was to revise all\r\nresolutions. \"It seems, however, to have been understood by those who\r\nvoted for it as applying only to free coloured persons whose rights\r\nmight be infringed by Southern laws or to slaves in the District of\r\nColumbia; and the pledge given to try the question of slavery in the\r\nUnited States Courts seems to have arisen from the notion that the\r\nquestion of the accordance of slavery with the Constitution might be\r\nincidentally raised and determined even in a case in which the party\r\nwhose rights are to be vindicated is free.\"\r\n\r\nIn conclusion Mr. Loring said that this question would assume an\r\nimportant aspect at the future meetings of the Antislavery Society, and\r\nearnestly hoped wise and honest counsel would prevail. He thought it\r\nwould be sufficient ground for dissolving the Union were the United\r\nStates Supreme Court to assume power over slavery in the several States.\r\n\"The honesty and common sense of the nation,\" he wrote, \"would revolt\r\nagainst such a doctrine and against those who should maintain it.\"\r\n\r\nIn his reply, dated the 29th of March, Judge Jay congratulated Mr.\r\nLoring on the service he had rendered the cause of abolition by\r\nprocuring the passage of the resolutions from the board of managers. \"In\r\nthe fulness of our zeal,\" he wrote, \"we are all liable occasionally to\r\nstray beyond the line of propriety, and it evinces more devotion to duty\r\nto acknowledge and correct errors than to avoid committing them.\"\r\n\r\nAt the fifth annual meeting of the American Antislavery Society, held at\r\nthe Broadway Tabernacle on the 2d of May, 1838, Alvan Stewart of Utica,\r\nN. Y., offered a resolution, vigorously supported by himself and others,\r\nto the following effect:\r\n\r\n  \"That the clause of the second article of the constitution of this\r\n  society be struck out which admits 'that each State in which slavery\r\n  exists has, by the Constitution of the United States, the exclusive\r\n  right to legislate in regard to its abolition in said State.'\"\r\n\r\nThis motion was equivalent to a declaration on the part of the society\r\nthat Congress had the right, under the Constitution, to abolish slavery.\r\nJudge Jay had previously declared that Stewart's doctrine was false,\r\nuntenable, and hurtful to the cause. The arguments by which it was\r\nsupported he considered absurd. For two days of continued debate he\r\nexposed its fallacy and danger and was rewarded by the defeat of the\r\nresolution. But such attempts to change the original articles of belief\r\nupon which the society was founded gave him great uneasiness for the\r\nfuture. His feelings upon this subject were shown in a letter to the\r\nsecretary of the Young Men's Antislavery Society who had invited him to\r\npreside at its convention:\r\n\r\n  \"On uniting with the American Antislavery Society some years since I\r\n  remarked, with the letter requesting that my name might be enrolled\r\n  among its members, that I had attentively considered its\r\n  constitution, and expressed my conviction that in joining the\r\n  society I was acting consistently with my obligations as a Christian\r\n  and a citizen. The great moral principles advanced in the\r\n  constitution perfectly accorded, in my opinion, with the precepts of\r\n  the Gospel, and the measures proposed, by which those principles\r\n  were to be carried into practice, equally accorded with the\r\n  obligations of the oath I had taken to support the Constitution of\r\n  the United States. I embarked in the antislavery cause with a firm\r\n  determination to support the principles and measures avowed by the\r\n  society at the hazard of obloquy, persecution, and, if necessary,\r\n  even life itself; and never in advocating the cause to sacrifice\r\n  truth and principle to expediency. How far I have acted up to this\r\n  determination others must judge. I am not myself conscious of having\r\n  departed from it.\r\n\r\n  \"The constitution of the society contains an express admission that\r\n  'each State in which slavery exists has, by the Constitution of the\r\n  United States, the exclusive right to legislate in regard to its\r\n  abolition;' and the object of the society in regard to slavery\r\n  in the States is declared to be to effect its abolition by\r\n  'arguments addressed to the understandings and consciences of our\r\n  fellow-citizens.' Notwithstanding these explicit declarations we\r\n  were accused of aiming to effect our object by inducing Congress to\r\n  invade the rights of the States by abolishing slavery within their\r\n  limits; and it was justly argued that such an attempt was\r\n  unconstitutional, and would, if successful, lead to civil war and a\r\n  severance of the Union. So gross and unfounded were the calumnies\r\n  circulated against us, that it was deemed expedient by the executive\r\n  committee of the society, of which I was one, to publish an address\r\n  to the public, pledging our individual characters and responsibility\r\n  as to the real objects and principles entertained by our\r\n  association. This address bore my signature among others, and\r\n  contained, as nearly as I can recollect, the following passage: 'We\r\n  hold that Congress has no more right to abolish slavery in the\r\n  States in which it exists than it has to abolish slavery in the\r\n  French West India Islands; consequently we desire no national\r\n  legislation on the subject.' We were justified in giving this pledge\r\n  by the declaration of the convention which formed the society, by\r\n  the constitution of the society itself, by the constitutions of the\r\n  several State societies, and by the uniform language of antislavery\r\n  publications. Few persons have been more conversant with the\r\n  writings of abolitionists than myself; yet I can truly aver that\r\n  until the appearance of Mr. Stewart's extraordinary argument I was\r\n  not aware that there was a man or woman belonging to an antislavery\r\n  society who entertained a different opinion. This gentleman, holding\r\n  the responsible station of chairman of the executive committee of\r\n  the State society, avowing in its constitution the inability of\r\n  Congress to abolish slavery in the States, published an article in\r\n  the official paper of the society, asserting the constitutional\r\n  power of Congress immediately to emancipate every slave in the\r\n  United States, declaring that abolitionists had 'but one thing to\r\n  do'--which was to petition Congress to exercise this power; thus\r\n  repudiating the moral means they had prescribed for themselves,\r\n  viz., 'arguments addressed to the understandings and consciences of\r\n  our fellow-citizens'; and virtually recommending the employment of\r\n  _force_, the power of the general government as the sole agent in\r\n  effecting the abolition of slavery.\r\n\r\n  \"I had supposed that sentiments so utterly at variance with the\r\n  solemn asseverations of abolitionists, so repugnant to the\r\n  constitutional pledges of their societies, would have excited\r\n  universal indignation; but I was mistaken. After the publication of\r\n  these sentiments, Mr. Stewart was selected as one of the orators of\r\n  the American Society at their ensuing anniversary. At the annual\r\n  meeting in May last he moved to purge from the constitution the\r\n  concession I have quoted, thus giving the society the constitutional\r\n  right of discharging what he had proclaimed the sole duty of\r\n  abolitionists, that of petitioning Congress to abolish slavery in\r\n  the States; and in supporting his motion he ridiculed the idea of\r\n  effecting our object by addresses to the understanding and\r\n  consciences of slaveholders. On taking the question a majority of\r\n  the society was in favour of expunging; and the admission respecting\r\n  the power of Congress still stands in the constitution only because\r\n  it required a vote of two thirds to cancel it. Mr. Stewart was\r\n  afterwards elected a manager of the society. A State society since\r\n  organized has by a formal vote refused to insert the usual admission\r\n  into its constitution, and another previously organized has since\r\n  stricken it from its constitution.\r\n\r\n  \"From this state of facts it is apparent that the pledges given to\r\n  the public in our constitution, and in the address of the executive\r\n  committee to which I have referred, that abolitionists admitted that\r\n  Congress had no right to interfere with slavery in the States, that\r\n  hence arguments were the only means they intended to use for its\r\n  abolition, have been flagrantly falsified. So far as I was\r\n  concerned, and unquestionably many more, the pledge was given in\r\n  good faith, and however others may belie it, I mean honestly to\r\n  abide by it. In my opinion, Congress has no more right to pass a\r\n  general emancipation law than to direct how Broadway shall be paved;\r\n  and without intending to impeach the motives of others, I must take\r\n  the liberty to say that I would regard such a law as a most wicked\r\n  and detestable act of usurpation--an act that would inevitably and\r\n  properly sever the Union and necessarily result in bloodshed and\r\n  national calamity.\r\n\r\n  \"It seems to me, moreover, inconsistent with Christian sincerity and\r\n  plain dealing for our societies to profess in their constitution a\r\n  belief in great and important principles, and to promise to regulate\r\n  their measures in accordance with those principles, and at the same\r\n  time to retain in communion with them and elevate to office men who\r\n  openly repudiate and ridicule those principles and avow a wish to\r\n  introduce a course of action utterly repugnant.\r\n\r\n  \"On discovering from the proceedings of last May that the American\r\n  Society and its auxiliaries no longer considered their avowed\r\n  principles binding on their members, but that they might be treated\r\n  with insult and ridicule without incurring a loss of either\r\n  confidence or office, and that in the bosom of the society opinions\r\n  were entertained utterly at variance with public and solemn\r\n  professions, and in their practical consequences hostile to the\r\n  welfare of the country and inconsistent with the oath I had taken to\r\n  support the Constitution of the United States, I deemed it my duty\r\n  no longer to share in the responsibilities of their measures. I have\r\n  not since taken part in the meeting of any antislavery society, and\r\n  the recklessness with which the pledge given by myself and other\r\n  officers of the society has been falsified, warns me to be cautious\r\n  how I again become identified with the promises and declarations of\r\n  these associations. These considerations induce me very respectfully\r\n  to decline your kind invitation.\r\n\r\n  \"My attachment to the cause of abolition, and to the principles\r\n  avowed in the constitution of the American Society, was never\r\n  stronger than at this moment; and I shall ever regard it a duty and\r\n  a privilege to labour for the abolition of slavery in every manner\r\n  consistent with propriety and my moral and political obligations.\r\n\r\n  \"Although my confidence in the integrity and singleness of purpose\r\n  of antislavery societies is weakened, I have not the most distant\r\n  wish to interrupt their harmony or impede their usefulness. I have\r\n  thus, sir, frankly but with much pain stated my sentiments. These\r\n  sentiments I have no desire to conceal or to obtrude upon others;\r\n  and you are at liberty to suppress this letter or make any use of it\r\n  you may think proper.\"\r\n\r\nThe annual meeting of the Connecticut Antislavery Society was held at\r\nNew Haven in May, 1840, commencing on the 20th. The society considered\r\nthis meeting to be of vital importance to the prosperity of the cause in\r\nthat State on account of the Legislature being in session there at that\r\ntime, many of the members of which were expected to attend.\r\n\r\nIn April Judge Jay received an invitation from the Committee of\r\nArrangements to deliver an address on the \"Action of the Federal\r\nGovernment in Behalf of Slavery,\" on which subject the Committee felt\r\nconvinced that Judge Jay could \"give the society as well as our\r\nlegislators some valuable information.\"\r\n\r\nOther engagements compelled Judge Jay to decline the invitation. In his\r\nletter to the Committee of Arrangements informing them of his inability\r\nto comply with their request, Judge Jay assured them that the interest\r\nhe had theretofore professed to feel in the antislavery cause had\r\nsuffered no diminution; and his conviction of the truth of the great\r\nprinciples set forth in the constitution of the American Society had, if\r\npossible, grown stronger from continued reflection and observation; but\r\nas to the singleness of purpose and the efficiency and integrity of the\r\npresent antislavery organization his opinion had undergone a change.\r\n\r\n  \"In joining the organization,\" he wrote, \"I had good cause to\r\n  believe that I would not be called upon to co-operate with men who\r\n  condemned any of its avowed principles, or with men who would seek\r\n  to render it an instrument for promoting other objects than the\r\n  abolition of slavery.\r\n\r\n  \"One of the principles laid down in the constitution of the\r\n  American Society, and a most important one as limiting its\r\n  operations, is that by the Constitution of the United States\r\n  Congress has no right to legislate for the abolition of slavery in\r\n  the several States in which it exists. Yet a gentleman was in 1838\r\n  chosen by the society one of its officers after having both in print\r\n  and in the presence of the society denied this doctrine and\r\n  contended that it was the duty of abolitionists to petition Congress\r\n  to pass a law for the immediate emancipation of all the slaves in\r\n  the United States. The expulsion of this gentleman from the society\r\n  was in my opinion required by the respect it owed itself, and by the\r\n  good faith it owed both to the public and to its members. The course\r\n  pursued was an emphatic declaration on the part of the society that\r\n  its professed principles, however useful they might be in\r\n  conciliating public confidence and in acquiring funds, were by no\r\n  means binding on its members. Having sworn to support the\r\n  Constitution of the United States, and regarding the proposed mode\r\n  of emancipation a most palpable violation of it, and seeing that the\r\n  avowed principles of the society were in fact no security for its\r\n  conformity to them in its conduct, I then determined never again to\r\n  take a part in its meetings or in those of its auxiliaries.\r\n  Subsequent events have given me no cause to regret this\r\n  determination.\r\n\r\n  \"One of the great objects for which the American Society was\r\n  avowedly formed was to effect the abolition of slavery in the\r\n  District of Columbia and of the American slave-trade by\r\n  Congressional legislation. Yet men belonging to the society, and\r\n  even some of its officers, are now publicly maintaining that all\r\n  compulsory laws are sinful, and of course that it would be a\r\n  usurpation of the divine prerogative for Congress to suppress by\r\n  penal law the abomination of slavery in the capital of the republic,\r\n  and the nefarious traffic in human flesh of which the capital is\r\n  the great depot. I cannot as an abolitionist act with those who\r\n  reprobate all enactments, not merely for the abolition of slavery\r\n  where it exists, but even for preventing its re-establishment on\r\n  soil from which it has been extirpated; and also for protecting the\r\n  poor coloured man, his wife, and children from the merciless\r\n  kidnapper.\r\n\r\n  \"Certainly the founders of the society did not intend to effect by\r\n  it any alteration in the social relations of the sexes; and not the\r\n  most distant hint of such a design can be found in the Constitution;\r\n  yet it is in vain to deny that an attempt is now making to render\r\n  antislavery societies instrumental in advancing certain theories\r\n  respecting the rights of women.\r\n\r\n  \"The American Society was intended as a central organization by\r\n  which the contributions and efforts of abolitionists were to be\r\n  concentrated and directed; and for some years it discharged its\r\n  functions with wonderful zeal, energy, and success. But at last the\r\n  managers of certain local societies imagined that the vitality of\r\n  the extremities of the system would be quickened by arresting the\r\n  pulsations of the heart; and accordingly measures were adopted, and\r\n  with perfect success, to paralyze the parent institution.\r\n\r\n  \"For a while abolitionists exhibited a pattern of Christian and\r\n  disinterested benevolence in behalf of the oppressed which commanded\r\n  the secret admiration even of their enemies, and conciliated the\r\n  favour of the good. Latterly a strong desire has been evinced to\r\n  change the antislavery enterprise from a religious into a political\r\n  one, and a scramble for the loaves and fishes has already commenced.\r\n\r\n  \"Unwilling to take a part in the bitter feuds which now divide\r\n  abolitionists, and not choosing to assume any responsibility for\r\n  principles and measures I cannot approve, I deem it most consistent\r\n  with my obligations as a Christian and a citizen to absent myself\r\n  from an arena in which I can do no good and in which I can no\r\n  longer appear without being engaged in unprofitable conflict. But\r\n  most cheerfully will I again enlist in a new antislavery\r\n  organization (if any such can be devised) that will offer a fair\r\n  promise of avoiding the errors which have destroyed the efficiency\r\n  and moral character of the present.\r\n\r\n  \"I beg you to be assured that in the preceding remarks I have had no\r\n  particular reference to the Connecticut Society, not being aware\r\n  that it is open to censure.\r\n\r\n  \"I have no desire either to conceal or to obtrude my opinions\r\n  respecting the existing state of the antislavery enterprise, but I\r\n  deemed it due to myself to state frankly and without reserve the\r\n  considerations which induce me to pursue a course apparently at\r\n  variance with my former public vindication of the American\r\n  Antislavery Society.\"\r\n\r\nAmong abolitionists there was a great diversity of opinion as to whether\r\nwomen should be admitted to membership in antislavery societies and\r\npermitted to hold office and generally to enjoy the same privileges as\r\nmen. This question was the cause of much feeling and was destined to\r\ncreate an unfortunate division in the antislavery ranks.\r\n\r\nThe subject was first voted upon in the New England Society, where, in\r\n1838, it was resolved to permit all persons, whether men or women, who\r\nagreed with them on the subject of slavery to participate in the\r\nmeetings as members. An attempt having been made in vain to rescind this\r\nvote, a protest was drawn up by Amos R. Phelps, Charles T. Torrey, and\r\nfive others, disclaiming all responsibility for it, and denouncing the\r\naction of the society as injurious to the cause of the slave by\r\nconnecting with it an entirely foreign subject and by establishing a\r\ndangerous precedent.\r\n\r\nAt the sixth annual meeting of the American Antislavery Society, held in\r\nNew York, May 7, 1839, it was voted, 180 ayes to 140 nays, \"that the\r\nroll of the convention be made up by placing upon it the names of all\r\npersons, male or female, who are delegated from any auxiliary society,\r\nor members of this society.\"\r\n\r\nThe seventh annual meeting of the American Society was fixed for the\r\n12th of May, 1840. It was generally realized that on this occasion a\r\ndefinitive settlement of the woman question would be made. The board of\r\nmanagers of the Massachusetts Society made strenuous efforts to insure a\r\nlarge attendance of members sharing their views. A large steamboat was\r\nchartered which conveyed Garrison and his party to New York, and it was\r\nsoon manifest that they had mustered a majority sufficient to carry\r\ntheir point.\r\n\r\nArthur Tappan, the president of the society, anticipating \"a recurrence\r\nof the scenes witnessed last year, and resolved not to be found\r\ncontending with his abolition brethren,\" did not attend the meeting, and\r\nFrancis Jackson presided in his place. Among the persons nominated by\r\nthe chairman as a business committee was Miss Abby Kelley. After a long\r\nand exciting debate Miss Kelley was elected by a vote of 557 to 451.\r\nImmediately after the result was announced, Lewis Tappan, Charles W.\r\nDenison, and Amos Phelps, members of the business committee, asked to be\r\nexcused from serving upon it.\r\n\r\nAfter the meeting had adjourned those members who had voted against the\r\nadmission of women met and organized a new society under the name of the\r\n\"American and Foreign Antislavery Society.\" Arthur Tappan was chosen\r\npresident, James G. Birney and Henry B. Stanton, secretaries, and Lewis\r\nTappan, treasurer. The Executive Committee was composed of Gerrit Smith,\r\nJudge Jay, John G. Whittier, Joshua Leavitt, and other leading\r\nabolitionists.\r\n\r\nOn June 1st Judge Jay wrote a note to Mr. J. C. Jackson, the recording\r\nsecretary of the American Antislavery Society, asking that his name be\r\nstricken from the roll as a member. In stating his reasons for\r\nresigning, he said that the proceedings at the late meeting of the\r\nsociety had convinced him that the institution was being used, by those\r\nwho had recently acquired control of it, as an instrument for advancing\r\nthe doctrine of the equality of the sexes in all the relations of life.\r\n\"Married women without their husbands,\" he said, \"were associated with\r\nmen in the Executive Committee--a committee to which is confided the\r\nmanagement of the society, and whose meetings have hitherto been, and\r\nwill probably continue to be, both frequent and private.\"\r\n\r\nThe principle thus officially avowed by the society Judge Jay declared\r\nhad not the remotest connection with the true objects for which the\r\nsociety was formed, nor was it sanctioned by the constitution. \"However\r\ngrievous some women may find the yoke imposed upon them by the opinions\r\nusually entertained on the subject,\" he continued, \"that is not the yoke\r\nwhich abolitionists associated to break.\" The claims now set up by the\r\nsociety in regard to \"the rights of women\" appeared to him necessarily\r\nto involve their participation in the sacred ministry, their exercise of\r\nthe elective franchise, and their entire independence in the conjugal\r\nrelation. Irrespective of the soundness of these claims, it did not\r\nappear by what right the society called upon its members to support\r\nthem. Judge Jay contended that \"any association for the professed\r\npurpose of abolishing negro slavery may with as much propriety prescribe\r\nthe form of baptism and the Lord's Supper as it may insist that women\r\nare authorized to administer these ordinances.\" Fully convinced that the\r\nsociety as thus managed was exerting an influence not only very\r\ninjurious to the antislavery cause, but contrary to domestic order and\r\nhappiness and inconsistent with the precepts of the Gospel, Judge Jay\r\ndeemed it his duty to sever his connection with it.\r\n\r\nIn our time, when the admission of women to participation in nearly\r\nevery form of activity is universally accepted, it may seem\r\nextraordinary that the American Antislavery Society should have divided\r\nupon such an issue. But what is now a familiar custom was then a\r\nstrange doctrine, the consequences of which were unknown and were\r\ndreaded by conservative people. The abolitionists whose votes admitted\r\nwomen to equal rights with men contended that women were among the most\r\nuseful and influential workers for the cause and that they should have a\r\ncorresponding position in the councils of the party. It was denied that\r\nactive participation in the meetings of the societies was inappropriate\r\nto their sex. On the other hand, it was believed by many persons\r\nearnestly and usefully engaged in the cause of emancipation that the\r\nantislavery society should pursue its end unimpeded and undisturbed by\r\noutside issues. The emancipation of woman might be a highly desirable\r\nreform, but it should be sought separately from the emancipation of the\r\nnegro. An individual should be allowed to labour for the slave without\r\nbeing forced to support untried theories regarding woman's rights and\r\nthe sinfulness of human government.\r\n\r\nAt this period Judge Jay was especially active with his pen. In 1839 was\r\npublished his \"View of the Action of the Federal Government in Behalf of\r\nSlavery.\" This work was the first effective exposure of the manner in\r\nwhich the United States Government had been used for many years by\r\npro-slavery statesmen to carry out their own ends. Judge Jay showed the\r\nshameful position in which the National Government had been placed\r\nbefore the nations of the world when the President and his diplomatic\r\nrepresentatives were forced by the Slave Power to demand the return of\r\nfugitive slaves and compensation for their loss when shipwreck had\r\nallowed them to attain liberty on a foreign shore; when the armies of\r\nthe United States were sent to Florida at enormous expense to capture\r\nalleged runaway private property; when the power of the Government was\r\nstrained to prevent abolition in Cuba and to introduce slavery into\r\nTexas. The efforts to suppress the right of petition and freedom of\r\ndebate in Congress were thoroughly described. An account, humiliating to\r\nevery American, was given of the condition of the national capital\r\nitself, converted by the fostering protection of the United States\r\nGovernment into the chief slave-market of the Union.\r\n\r\nJudge Jay's next publication was entitled, \"On the Condition of Free\r\nPeople of Colour in the United States.\" He showed that they were denied\r\nthe right to the franchise, to liberty of locomotion, to the lowest\r\nemployment in the public service; that their education was impeded\r\nalmost to prohibition and that even their industry was hampered by cruel\r\nrestrictions. Worst of all, they might at any time be seized and sold\r\ninto slavery without recourse to law. In 1840 appeared his pamphlet on\r\n\"The Violation by the House of Representatives of the Right of\r\nPetition.\" These writings had a wide circulation among persons not\r\nreached by the ordinary antislavery literature, and their influence was\r\nhighly beneficial.\r\n\r\nAlthough the woman question was the ostensible cause of the schism of\r\n1840, there were several other differences which tended quite as much to\r\ndivide the abolition camp. While the Garrison party continued to depend\r\nsolely upon moral agitation and opposed all political effort, a numerous\r\nand powerful body in the antislavery ranks began to look to the\r\nballot-box as the instrument of reform. In 1840, under the leadership of\r\nGerrit Smith, Alvan Stewart, Myron Holley, Elizur Wright, Joshua\r\nLeavitt, and William Goodell, a convention at Albany organized the\r\nLiberty party by the nomination of James G. Birney, of Kentucky, for\r\nPresident, and of Thomas Earle, of Pennsylvania, for Vice-President. Out\r\nof a total of about two and a half million votes cast at this election,\r\nthe candidates of the Liberty party received a little over seven\r\nthousand. W. H. Harrison, the whig candidate, defeated his democratic\r\nopponent, Martin Van Buren. Although the abolition vote was not large,\r\nit gave the party great encouragement, and an address was issued\r\ncongratulating the friends of the slave that a new power to overthrow\r\nslavery had been found in \"the terse literature of the ballot-box.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Jay's attitude towards the formation of the Liberty party appears\r\nin a correspondence which took place between him and Gerrit Smith in\r\nJuly, 1840. \"I suppose you have come, as well as myself,\" wrote Smith,\r\n\"to the conclusion that whilst American slavery exists our national\r\npolitical parties will be essentially and irrevocably pro-slavery\r\nparties, and that abolitionists cannot, therefore, vote consistently\r\nfor the candidates of such parties. If you have come to this conclusion,\r\nyou of course admit that we are under the necessity of designating our\r\nown candidates for law-makers and that the object of the Freeman's State\r\nConvention to be held in Syracuse the first Wednesday in August is\r\nproper. Now, when we come together in that convention there is one thing\r\nwhich, next to the blessing of Heaven, we shall need far more than any\r\nother. I mean your consent that we shall put you in nomination for\r\ngovernor. Will you enable me to insure the convention of that consent?\r\nIf you will, you will in so doing render a very great service to our\r\nholy cause--a service which I see not how we can well dispense with. If\r\nthere be anything selfish in your heart, we have, of course, nothing to\r\naddress to it. We do not expect to elect you, and we are well aware that\r\nyour nomination would expose you to pro-slavery ridicule and hatred. If\r\nyou give your consent to the nomination, we know that such consent must\r\nproceed from your disinterested and self-sacrificing love for the\r\nantislavery cause. Do, my dear sir, give us your name; we can rally\r\nabout it those who will be dead to the power of any other name.\"\r\n\r\nTo this strong appeal Jay gave the following reply:\r\n\r\n  \"I was last evening favoured with your letter of the 20th inst.\r\n  asking me to consent to be the abolition candidate for governor at\r\n  the ensuing election. The request implies a confidence in the\r\n  strength and sincerity of my attachment for the abolition cause that\r\n  demands my acknowledgments. I cannot now embrace the opportunity\r\n  afforded by your letter of entering at large into the question of a\r\n  distinct abolition party; but justice to myself and respect for you\r\n  induce me to mention some general principles which I think\r\n  applicable to the present case.\r\n\r\n  \"An abolition political party supposes a union for the election of\r\n  rulers without regard to the sentiments of the associates or their\r\n  candidates on any other subject than that of slavery. Of course the\r\n  party and the rulers elected by them may have the most opposite and\r\n  irreconcilable opinions on every topic but one of local and national\r\n  interest; yet it is supposed such discordant materials will form one\r\n  homogeneous mass. Abolitionists give but little promise of such\r\n  wonderful unity in the future. I doubt the practicability of forming\r\n  such a party; and I moreover question whether such a party would be\r\n  consistent with our obligations as citizens. It is evident that this\r\n  party could effect its professed object, the abolition of slavery,\r\n  only in a course of years, and in the meantime it is _to neglect and\r\n  disregard every other interest_. The party as such can have no\r\n  opinion and exert no influence either in elections or elsewhere in\r\n  relation to the trade, the finances, internal improvements, foreign\r\n  affairs, or the military power of the nation, and no inquiry is to\r\n  be allowed into the opinions of candidates on these most important\r\n  topics.\r\n\r\n  \"I fear the very attempt to form such a party will prove injurious\r\n  to the antislavery cause. It excites dissensions among ourselves. On\r\n  this point I will not enlarge. It will present in its results a\r\n  false and disheartening estimate of the number of abolitionists;\r\n  because as many antislavery men will refuse to support the abolition\r\n  candidates, the canvass will represent us as far less numerous than\r\n  we really are. Moreover, the abolitionists who are thus called out\r\n  of the political parties can of course exercise no more influence in\r\n  them. We are depriving the parties of the little salt that keeps\r\n  them from utter putrefaction. Had the whig abolitionists in the last\r\n  Legislature been nominated by an abolitionist party they would not\r\n  have been elected and we should not now have the glorious and\r\n  blessed jury law.\r\n\r\n  \"I have never approved under present circumstances of any further\r\n  organized interference by abolitionists with elections than the\r\n  official questioning of candidates. Under that system every\r\n  abolitionist might exert a powerful influence merely by withholding\r\n  his vote, without giving his suffrage for one to whom he was\r\n  politically opposed. The experiment failed, but by whose fault?\r\n  Seward and Bradish, Marcy and Tracy, dealt frankly with us. Yet\r\n  abolitionists made but little difference between the friends and\r\n  foes. Had Bradish had 20,000 votes more than Seward the conversion\r\n  of our politicians to abolition would have been general and\r\n  instantaneous, and slavery would have received an irremediable\r\n  wound. And can we believe that if abolitionists would not then\r\n  refrain from voting for the party, they will now consent to vote\r\n  against it?\r\n\r\n  \"I am very far from thinking that it can never be right and proper\r\n  to set up abolition candidates without regard to party preferences.\r\n  Had the question of emancipation been almost equally poised in the\r\n  British Parliament it would have been patriotic to turn the scale by\r\n  a temporary abandonment of the contested objects and the election of\r\n  antislavery members. And so also I can readily conceive of\r\n  circumstances in which it may be the duty of the abolitionists of a\r\n  particular State or district to suspend for a time their labours for\r\n  the slave in order to unite with the friends of temperance to carry\r\n  some great point. But taking into consideration the existing\r\n  circumstances of the antislavery cause, I am not clear that the\r\n  formation of an abolition political party, disregarding all the\r\n  other interests of the country, is consistent with either duty or\r\n  policy, and of course it becomes me to decline the request with\r\n  which you have honoured me. May God enlighten and direct us, and\r\n  when we cannot think alike may He give us the graces of meekness and\r\n  charity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nJUDGE JAY CONTINUES TO SUPPORT THE ANTISLAVERY CAUSE BY HIS ADVICE\r\n  AND WRITINGS.--IN CONSEQUENCE OF HIS OPINIONS HE IS DEPRIVED OF HIS\r\n  SEAT ON THE BENCH.--HIS VISIT TO EUROPE.--HIS VIEWS ON THE LIBERTY\r\n  PARTY.--ON THE ANNEXATION OF TEXAS.--HIS \"REVIEW OF THE MEXICAN\r\n  WAR.\"--HIS ADVOCACY OF INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION AS A REMEDY FOR\r\n  WAR.--HIS WORK IN THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the division in the ranks of the antislavery societies in 1840,\r\nJudge Jay ceased to take an active part in their proceedings, preferring\r\nto support the cause independently by his writings. But he was\r\ncontinually applied to by the societies to assist them by his advice, to\r\ngive legal opinions on the positions which they wished to take, and to\r\nprepare documents which required special judgment and ability.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1842, Jay prepared an address to the British Antislavery\r\nSociety, at the request of Mrs. Lydia Maria Child, who wrote on behalf\r\nof the American Antislavery Society. A little later, again by request of\r\nMrs. Child, he gave a legal opinion on the advisability of carrying to\r\nthe Supreme Court the cases of three men who had been condemned in\r\nMissouri to twelve years' imprisonment for aiding slaves to escape.\r\n\r\nHe continued his membership in the American and Foreign Antislavery\r\nSociety in New York. Here he laboured unceasingly to keep the society\r\nfast to its declared purpose, and to prevent it from adding new\r\ndoctrines and objects which he believed must result in further divisions\r\ninjurious to the cause.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1841, he wrote on this subject to Lewis Tappan:\r\n\r\n  \"I am glad the society will not be concerned in establishing a\r\n  missionary station in Africa. The great vice of our antislavery\r\n  societies has been, and is, meddling with things they have no right\r\n  to meddle with, and this they have done on a most vicious principle,\r\n  that the end sanctifies the means. In general, abolitionists mean\r\n  well; but they grievously mistake when they think themselves\r\n  authorized to pursue, in their associated capacity, whatever\r\n  benevolent or religious plan they individually approve. They unite\r\n  for certain specified purposes, and receive money expressly to\r\n  forward those purposes; and to employ their associated influence or\r\n  their common funds for other distinct purposes is not, in my\r\n  opinion, consistent with strict morality.\"\r\n\r\nIn August, 1841, Judge Jay was requested by the Executive Committee of\r\nthe American and Foreign Antislavery Society to allow his name to be\r\nannounced as a regular contributor to the society's organ, the\r\n_Reporter_. He took this opportunity to repeat his warnings against the\r\ndeparture of the abolitionists from the line of action which they had\r\nmarked out for themselves in the early days of the agitation.\r\n\r\n  \"As an abolitionist I have deeply deplored the dissensions which\r\n  have marred our harmony and almost annihilated our moral influence;\r\n  and I have constantly and resolutely abstained, as far as my sense\r\n  of duty would permit me, from aggravating those dissensions by\r\n  partaking in them. The obvious tendency of the _announcement_\r\n  contemplated by your resolution is to impress the public with the\r\n  belief that the gentlemen who are held forth as the future\r\n  contributors to the _Reporter_ maintain the principles and approve\r\n  the course of that paper. Such an impression, so far as regards\r\n  myself, would be most strictly accurate were the principles and\r\n  course of the paper to continue such as they have hitherto been. To\r\n  the American and Foreign Antislavery Society I did fondly look as a\r\n  refuge for such abolitionists as had been expelled from the old\r\n  society by the faithlessness of those who converted it into an\r\n  instrument for spreading other than antislavery doctrines. I did,\r\n  notwithstanding past experience, regard the constitution of the new\r\n  society as affording a guarantee that its members would not be\r\n  required to support any other principles and measures than such as\r\n  were indicated in that instrument. In consequence of this belief I\r\n  did not decline office in the society, and I aided in defraying the\r\n  expenses and in filling the columns of the _Reporter_. The paper was\r\n  conducted with ability and honesty, promised to exert a happy\r\n  influence in restoring peace and harmony to our ranks. The society\r\n  was pledged by its constitution 'carefully to abstain from all the\r\n  machinery of party political arrangements in effecting the objects,'\r\n  and the _Reporter_ faithfully conformed itself to this pledge. But\r\n  in the very last number we are informed that at the last meeting a\r\n  vote of the society, '_nearly unanimous_,' was taken in favour of\r\n  striking this pledge from the constitution, but that inasmuch as the\r\n  notice required by Article X. had not been given, the amendment was\r\n  not _constitutionally_ adopted. The pledge is therefore virtually,\r\n  although not formally, withdrawn; and we have every reason to\r\n  believe that at the next meeting it will be expunged from the\r\n  constitution. It is therefore obvious that the society, instead of\r\n  being a rallying point for abolitionists, is henceforth to be a mere\r\n  partisan organization, excluding from its fellowship multitudes of\r\n  honest, zealous, and consistent abolitionists because they cannot\r\n  adopt the maxim now promulgated in certain quarters, that the\r\n  friends of immediate emancipation should labour to secure for\r\n  themselves all the loaves and fishes in the gift of the\r\n  republic--the power and emoluments of _every office_, from that of\r\n  President of the United States to that of Path Master of a ward\r\n  district. The vote of the society just mentioned is tantamount to a\r\n  declaration that it will as soon as possible employ all the\r\n  machinery of party political arrangement for the exclusive elevation\r\n  of abolitionists to political power. This is not an object for which\r\n  I have associated with abolitionists, nor is it one in which I\r\n  intend to co-operate with them. But the _Reporter_, I am bound to\r\n  believe, will be used as an instrument to effect this object,\r\n  because I am bound to believe that the official organ of the society\r\n  will not fail to advocate and pursue its avowed policy. Hence I\r\n  cannot and ought not to give it in advance my confidence and\r\n  countenance by complying with the request with which you have\r\n  honoured me.\r\n\r\n  \"I have thus frankly stated my sentiments without intending to\r\n  impeach the motives of others, and without meaning to assume a\r\n  hostile attitude towards the friends and supporters of what\r\n  is denominated the Third party. With that party I cannot\r\n  conscientiously and consistently unite, but I have purposely\r\n  abstained from publicly mingling in the controversies to which it\r\n  has given rise, and I have now expressed my dissent from it only\r\n  because I could not otherwise explain my refusal of your polite\r\n  invitation.\r\n\r\n  \"In justice to myself, permit me to remark that my opinions on\r\n  slavery and abolition have undergone no change, and that every\r\n  principle I have ever avowed as an abolitionist is still cherished\r\n  by me with no other difference than possibly a stronger conviction\r\n  than formerly of its truth and importance.\r\n\r\n  \"That we may all be guided by wisdom from above and be enabled not\r\n  merely to break the bonds of the slaves, but in our conduct to adorn\r\n  our Christian profession, is my fervent wish.\"\r\n\r\nThe antislavery societies, by the admission into their proceedings of\r\nprojected reforms having no connection with their ostensible object, had\r\ngradually become divided and weakened. Jay had protested unceasingly\r\nagainst this course, but the tendency had been irresistible. \"Our\r\nantislavery societies,\" he wrote in 1846, \"are, for the most part,\r\nvirtually defunct. Antislavery conventions are whatever the leaders\r\npresent happen to be; sometimes disgustingly irreligious, and very often\r\nJacobinical and disorganizing; and frequently proscriptive of such of\r\ntheir brethren who will not consent to render abolition a mere\r\ninstrument for effecting certain political changes having no relation\r\nwhatever to slavery.\"\r\n\r\nThe antislavery societies had accomplished the noble and seemingly\r\nhopeless task of arousing the national conscience from its lethargy.\r\nTheir labours had started and given irresistible impulse to a movement\r\non behalf of the slave which was not to rest until emancipation was\r\nattained. But the active conduct of this movement was now passing from\r\ntheir hands into the domain of politics. The contest had become a\r\nnational issue, to be fought out in legislative halls and to be\r\ndetermined at the polls.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1843, the national convention of the Liberty party was held\r\nat Buffalo. This convention was more largely attended than the first,\r\nevery free State excepting New Hampshire having sent delegates. James G.\r\nBirney was again nominated for President, and Thomas Morris, of Ohio,\r\nfor Vice-President. The canvass was carried on with great vigour and\r\nspirit. The Birney vote in 1843 showed a large increase, amounting to\r\n60,000. It caused the election of Polk and gave to the abolitionists the\r\nbalance of power in New York and Michigan.\r\n\r\nJudge Jay had never considered himself as belonging to either the Whig\r\nor the Democratic party. He believed that his judicial position should\r\ndebar him from active partisanship. Above all, his disapproval of the\r\npolicy adopted by both political parties towards the slavery question\r\ndisinclined him to be a member of either. His attitude towards the\r\nLiberty party, on its formation in 1840, was set forth in the letter\r\nwritten to Gerrit Smith declining the nomination for governor, which was\r\nquoted at length in the last chapter. Judge Jay then doubted the\r\nexpediency of a separate political party making abolition its article\r\nof faith and test of membership. But as events proceeded, as both the\r\ngreat parties seemed irrevocably pledged to the support of slavery,\r\nabove all, as both favoured the annexation of Texas, Jay became a\r\npronounced and active member of the Liberty party.\r\n\r\nHe viewed the annexation proceedings with horror, as the death-knell of\r\nemancipation and as a scheme of wicked injustice which must react\r\ninjuriously upon the whole nation. In March, 1843, he wrote to Dr. H. J.\r\nBowditch, of Boston: \"The full and entire triumph of the antislavery\r\ncause is near and certain, provided that Texas is kept out of the Union.\r\nOn this point are centred all my fears. I am not disheartened by the\r\ncorruption of politicians, nor the deathlike apathy of the community, so\r\nlong as we remain independent of the renegade republic. Give us time and\r\nwe can arouse the community from its stupor, we can change public\r\nopinion, and politicians will bellow aloud for abolition the moment they\r\nfind it popular. The danger is that before this change is effected the\r\nslaveholders will demand the annexation of Texas as the price of the\r\npresidency and that one or more of the candidates will consent to pay\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Birney was nominated in 1843, Jay wrote to Gerrit Smith: \"I\r\ncongratulate you upon this result. Birney is a man for whom Christians\r\nand patriots can consistently vote. He shall have my cordial support. In\r\nmy opinion, the selection is creditable to the Liberty party, and if it\r\ncontinues to give us candidates of this character, it will be a blessing\r\nto our country.... To that party I shall be true so far, and so far\r\nonly, as it shall be true to itself. May God direct its measures for the\r\nprotection of our own rights and for the ultimate liberation of the\r\nslave.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Jay was as anxious that the Liberty party should keep faithfully\r\nto its antislavery purpose as he had been in the case of the antislavery\r\nsocieties. He believed that the party must end in failure if it allowed\r\nextraneous and dividing policies to be admitted to its platform. On this\r\nsubject he wrote in September, 1845, to Henry B. Stanton, who had\r\ninvited him to a convention in Boston:\r\n\r\n  \"Notwithstanding the annexation of Texas, great good may result from\r\n  the Liberty party, provided it be faithful to itself, and be wisely\r\n  conducted. Hence I am distressed by whatever threatens to impair its\r\n  integrity and usefulness. You are not ignorant, I presume, of the\r\n  strenuous efforts now making to change its character and to convert\r\n  it from an antislavery party into one for matters and things in\r\n  general.\r\n\r\n  \"It is proposed by men of talents, energy, and influence that the\r\n  party shall in future maintain:\r\n\r\n  \"That the Federal Government has the Constitutional power to abolish\r\n  slavery in the _States_.\r\n\r\n  \"That the clergy shall be subject to all the burdens and enjoy all\r\n  the privileges of other citizens. This is aimed at the clergy of New\r\n  York who are not eligible to office, but exempted, to a great\r\n  extent, from taxation. No man is hereafter to be acknowledged to\r\n  belong to the Liberty party unless he objects to the State showing\r\n  any indulgence to the ministers of religion. They must be enrolled\r\n  in the militia, and, like others, called out to work on the highway.\r\n\r\n  \"That custom-houses be abolished, and with them all protective\r\n  duties.\r\n\r\n  \"That the salaries of the President and Congressmen be reduced.\r\n\r\n  \"That the legal profession is a privileged caste and should be\r\n  abolished.\r\n\r\n  \"That the public lands be given away.\r\n\r\n  \"That all monopolies, by which I understand incorporated companies,\r\n  banks, railroads, etc., be abolished.\r\n\r\n  \"That women should exercise the right of suffrage and be eligible to\r\n  office, etc., etc., etc.\r\n\r\n  \"It is needless to say that if these tests of membership of the\r\n  Liberty party be adopted, we shall drive from us all whose judgment\r\n  or whose consciences revolt at them, while those who remain in the\r\n  party will regard the removal of slavery as a very subordinate\r\n  object of their labours. My purpose of troubling you with this\r\n  letter is to suggest to you the expediency of the convention\r\n  adopting a resolution in which, without alluding to the efforts\r\n  making to change the character of the party, it shall declare that\r\n  the sole objects of the party are the abolition of slavery, the\r\n  deliverance of the Federal Government from its influence, and the\r\n  elevation of the coloured race to equal rights with the whites; and\r\n  inviting all who approve of those objects to co-operate with us,\r\n  whatever may be their opinion on questions of State or national\r\n  policy.\"\r\n\r\nAt the Liberty party convention held at Newburg in October, 1845, Judge\r\nJay was unanimously nominated as a candidate for Senator. In his letter\r\naccepting the nomination, he took occasion again to urge the exclusion\r\nof irrelevant subjects from the platform of the party.\r\n\r\n  \"Recent circumstances induce me to accompany my acceptance of this\r\n  nomination with some remarks. Attempts are making to render the\r\n  Liberty party subservient to other objects than the overthrow of\r\n  slavery and the elevation of the coloured people. To these attempts\r\n  I can lend no aid. While I most explicitly accord to every\r\n  abolitionist the right of expressing his own opinions on every\r\n  political and religious subject, I as explicitly deny the right, and\r\n  shall strenuously resist the attempt, to make me and other members\r\n  responsible for opinions not necessarily involved in the great\r\n  objects for the attainment of which the party was formed. In the\r\n  pursuit of those objects I will cordially and honestly co-operate\r\n  with others from whose sentiments I dissent; but I cannot co-operate\r\n  with them in promoting religious and political changes which I\r\n  believe to be wrong, in order to increase the influence and hasten\r\n  the triumph of the Liberty party. To do so would be to act upon the\r\n  principle, as wicked and detestable as slavery itself, that the end\r\n  justifies the means. The fact that many good men who unite in\r\n  abhorrence of slavery entertain conflicting views of the expediency\r\n  and morality of various proposed reforms seems to me a sufficient\r\n  reason why the Liberty party should not permit itself to be\r\n  distracted by the other questions which agitate the community, and\r\n  which in truth are of but little moment compared with the great evil\r\n  with which we are struggling.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1846 Jay wrote again on this subject: \"I shall leave the Liberty\r\nparty whenever it makes abolition a pack-horse to carry favourite\r\nmeasures unconnected with slavery, whether those measures are of whig or\r\ndemocratic origin.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1843 the antislavery opinions and labours of Judge Jay\r\ncaused the loss of his seat on the bench of Westchester County, which he\r\nhad occupied for more than twenty-five years with such general approval\r\nas to cause his steady reappointment term after term by governors of the\r\nState who were his political opponents. The circumstances of his removal\r\nare described in a letter which he wrote to Mr. Minot Mitchell, in May,\r\n1843:\r\n\r\n  \"I thank you for your friendly letter in relation to my removal from\r\n  the bench. The loss of an office which I had held for about a\r\n  quarter of a century (and which I had contemplated resigning in the\r\n  course of the present year) is not a matter of personal regret. My\r\n  motive in holding for so long a time a situation which subjected me\r\n  to no little inconvenience and yielded no emolument was a desire to\r\n  be useful, and a belief that I could exert on the bench a wholesome\r\n  moral influence. How far that belief was well founded is for others\r\n  to decide. To myself, it is grateful to know that my official\r\n  conduct, whatever mistakes I may have made, has been pure, unbiased\r\n  by personal partialities, and uninfluenced by any fear except that\r\n  of my Maker.\r\n\r\n  \"To the gentlemen of the Westchester bar generally, as well as to\r\n  yourself in particular, I am deeply indebted for the uniform\r\n  kindness and courtesy with which I have been treated; and had I\r\n  known at the December term that we were not to meet again, I would\r\n  have embraced the opportunity of publicly acknowledging my\r\n  obligations to them, and of bidding them an affectionate farewell.\r\n\r\n  \"Under the circumstances of the case, it would be an affectation of\r\n  humility to ascribe my loss of office to any dissatisfaction with my\r\n  official conduct on the part of the bar or the public. The _New York\r\n  Plebeian_, amid all its vituperative clamour for my dismissal, does\r\n  not even hint a charge against me as a judge, and the editor of the\r\n  _Westchester Herald_, notwithstanding his blind devotion to his\r\n  party, bears a flattering testimony to my ability as a 'jurist,' and\r\n  admits that my 'moral worth' is not questioned, as he believes, 'by\r\n  any man in the country.'\r\n\r\n  \"Nor have I been proscribed on account of my political opinions.\r\n  Those opinions belong to the old Washington school--I have never\r\n  concealed them; and they are the same now as they were when I\r\n  received office from Governors Tompkins, Clinton, Throop, and Marcy,\r\n  and when President Jackson tendered to me an important and lucrative\r\n  appointment.\r\n\r\n  \"For twenty years or more I have had no connection with party\r\n  politics, and have attended no party meeting. It appeared to me\r\n  unbecoming a judge to be a political partisan; and I, moreover,\r\n  observed so much profligacy, venality, and hypocritical profession\r\n  in both parties, that I could not conscientiously identify myself\r\n  with either. I have for years voted for those I believed to be the\r\n  most honest of the candidates offered for my suffrage, without\r\n  regard to the party dogmas they professed.\r\n\r\n  \"That the people of Westchester had lost their confidence in me and\r\n  wished me to descend from the bench is not pretended. On the\r\n  contrary, I have the most abundant and gratifying proofs of the\r\n  correctness of your remark, that my removal has occasioned in the\r\n  county, with all political parties, unusual dissatisfaction and\r\n  complaint.\r\n\r\n  \"If, then, my removal has been effected contrary to the wishes of\r\n  the county, and not because I lacked in ability or integrity, nor\r\n  even on account of my politics, it becomes a matter of public\r\n  interest to inquire with what motives and with what views the chief\r\n  magistrate of New York dispenses the patronage intrusted to him by\r\n  the constitution for the good of the State.\r\n\r\n  \"Governor Bouck has, in this instance, as in another far more\r\n  important, only acted as the instrument of a faction which, while\r\n  prating about _equal rights_, is ever ready and eager to barter the\r\n  welfare, honour, and freedom of the North for Southern votes.\r\n\r\n  \"You may recollect that previous to my last appointment I was\r\n  permitted to hold over for a year after my term of office had\r\n  expired. This extraordinary delay in filling a vacancy on the bench\r\n  was not the result of accident or inadvertency. It arose from doubts\r\n  entertained by the leaders at Albany whether the party would gain\r\n  more at the South than it would lose in Westchester by my removal.\r\n  Mr. Van Buren was then a candidate for the presidency, and I was\r\n  shown a confidential letter from one of his particular friends at\r\n  Albany to an influential democrat of this county, discussing the\r\n  expediency of my removal. The letter was put into my hands by the\r\n  gentleman to whom it was addressed. It was admitted by the writer\r\n  that my conduct as a judge was irreproachable, and that there were\r\n  no other objections to my reappointment than my antislavery\r\n  sentiments. My only fault in the eyes of this champion of equal\r\n  rights was that I was opposed to converting men and women into\r\n  beasts of burden. Still, he was apprehensive that my removal for\r\n  _such_ a cause might savour of persecution for _abstract opinions_;\r\n  in other words, might be unpopular; and he wished to know what the\r\n  party in Westchester deemed most expedient. After a year's\r\n  deliberation and hesitation, I was reappointed. Mr. Van Buren is\r\n  again a candidate, but _now_ he has a Southern democrat for a\r\n  competitor; and his party in the State being so strong that he can\r\n  well afford to risk a little dissatisfaction in Westchester, it is\r\n  deemed prudent to propitiate the demon of slavery by offering a\r\n  victim, however humble, on his altar. The _Plebeian_, devoted to Mr.\r\n  Van Buren's election, avowed with unblushing frankness that my\r\n  reappointment would be calculated to prejudice the Democratic party\r\n  'in the eyes of our Southern brethren.'\r\n\r\n  \"Thus, it seems that in order to elevate Mr. Van Buren to the\r\n  presidency the magistrates of the free, sovereign, and independent\r\n  State of New York are to be selected with reference to the good\r\n  pleasure of Southern slaveholders.\r\n\r\n  \"Pardon, my dear sir, the egotism of this letter. I have been\r\n  compelled to speak of myself in order to expose the canting\r\n  profligacy of our demagogues, and to illustrate one of the\r\n  numberless accursed influences of slavery. This abhorred system,\r\n  which in the South makes merchandise of the souls and bodies of men,\r\n  is at the same time trafficking in the politics, the religion, and\r\n  the liberties of the North, and putrefying whatever it touches.\r\n  Against this system I have contended, as did my father before me,\r\n  and the leisure Governor Bouck has given me shall be faithfully\r\n  devoted to a continuance of the warfare.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"leisure\" given to him by Governor Bouck had first to be used by Jay\r\nin an attempt to restore his health, which for several years had been\r\nfailing. In the autumn of 1843 he determined upon a visit to Egypt, and\r\non the 1st of November he sailed from New York in the \"Victoria,\" of\r\n1100 tons, accompanied by his wife and his daughters Maria and Augusta.\r\nAfter a short visit to London, the party sailed from Southampton for\r\nMalta in the \"Great Liverpool\" of the Oriental Line, with passengers and\r\nmail bound to India. At Malta Jay was interested in meeting the famous\r\nwit, scholar, and diplomatist, John Hookham Frere, who entertained him\r\nat his house outside the walls of the city.\r\n\r\nWhile in England, Jay had been requested by John Beaumont, on behalf of\r\nthe British and Foreign Antislavery Society, to take charge of a\r\nquantity of antislavery tracts printed in the Arabic language, and to\r\ninsure their distribution. After his arrival in Cairo, Jay gave packages\r\nof the tracts to several persons whose facilities for distributing them\r\nin Egypt were greater than his own. Others he disposed of himself.\r\n\"During the short time I was in Egypt,\" he said in a letter, \"I\r\ndistributed tracts in the slave market, in the bazaars, in a public\r\ncoffee-house, in the hotels, and to persons in the streets.\" And he was\r\nmuch struck with the fact that what he could do peacefully in Egypt, in\r\na portion of his own country would have endangered his life.\r\n\r\nOn his return home, Jay visited Paris, and while there communicated to\r\nthe Duc de Broglie the motives of the Southern statesmen in seeking the\r\nannexation of Texas, and made no secret of his hope that France would\r\noppose the proceedings.[C]\r\n\r\nThe events leading up to the annexation of Texas and the Mexican War\r\nwere followed by Jay with the closest attention. The injustice and\r\ncruelty with which Mexico was treated throughout these proceedings by\r\nthe United States Government excited his warmest indignation. He was\r\ndeeply grieved at events which seemed to postpone indefinitely the\r\nemancipation of the slaves; his fears were aroused for the security of\r\nfree institutions in the North by the great impetus given to the\r\nSouthern spirit of domination. But above all he felt the disgrace\r\nincurred by his own country in forcing upon a weak and friendly power a\r\ndesolating war for the sole object of wresting from it a territory to be\r\npeopled by slaves. The result of Jay's minute knowledge of this dark\r\npage in American history was embodied in a volume entitled \"A Review of\r\nthe Causes and Consequences of the Mexican War,\" which was published in\r\n1849. In this searching \"Review\" Jay exposed the parentage of the\r\nmovement for the acquisition of Texas in the desire of the South to\r\nextend the territory devoted to slavery, with the twofold object of\r\ncreating a new market for slave-breeders and of giving to the slave\r\nStates an overwhelming control of Congress. He traced the devious paths\r\nof intrigue by which a rebellion was fomented in Texas by Americans\r\nsettled there for that express purpose; the encouragement and aid given\r\nsecretly to the rebels by the United States; the recognition of their\r\nindependence; and finally the subterfuges adopted to achieve the\r\nannexation in violation of international rights and the Constitution\r\nitself. Jay set forth plainly the fact that hostilities were begun by\r\nthe United States troops; he described the military operations by which\r\na weak and defenceless people were reduced to consent to a dismemberment\r\nof their country; he showed the enormous cost in life and money involved\r\nin this war undertaken to furnish a new market for slaves and new power\r\nto slaveholders. Jay's \"Review of the Mexican War\" is a contribution to\r\nthe history of the country which students cannot afford to pass unread.\r\nThe views expressed in it are painful to patriotism for the reason that\r\nthey are dictated by the pure patriotism which would make known the\r\nwhole truth as a warning to posterity.\r\n\r\nThe book on the Mexican War was written originally for the American\r\nPeace Society, which had offered a prize for the best work on the\r\nsubject. The committee appointed to pass judgment on the dissertations\r\npresented in competition awarded the prize to Jay's book on condition\r\nthat he should expunge from it all \"general censures on the Whig party.\"\r\nJay refused to comply with this condition and the prize went to another.\r\nBut the Peace Society recognized that the value of Jay's book lay in its\r\nimpartial character and caused it to be published as the exposition of\r\nthe society's views.\r\n\r\nAs nearly all the newspapers of both parties had supported the war, they\r\nwere loth to notice a book which placed the object of their encomiums in\r\nso unpleasant a light. But many private letters were received by Jay\r\nwhich showed him that he had the approval of the best minds. Joshua R.\r\nGiddings wrote: \"Thanks be to Him who rules the destiny of nations that\r\nwe have among us competent and faithful men who possess the moral\r\ncourage to stand forth and chronicle, in the language of truth, the\r\nbarbarities of which the nation is guilty. The history of this age will\r\nspeak to those who come after facts which will cause our descendants to\r\nblush. Your 'Review of the Mexican War' is faithful and just.... In\r\nwriting it you have performed a service to your country and to mankind\r\ninfinitely greater than was ever performed by any military officer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Every portion of it,\" wrote Charles Francis Adams, \"commands my\r\nunqualified assent. That in the course of God's providence good may be\r\nultimately educed out of evil is the only compensating reflection which\r\nwe can draw from the observation of so much wrong. It may be that out of\r\nthe very measures so wickedly devised to sustain a system of crime may\r\ncome the means by which it will be overthrown. That your book will do\r\ngreat service in combining and perpetuating the evidence bearing upon\r\nthis portion of American history, I do not for a moment doubt. It is my\r\nprofound conviction that there never was a more wicked and unjustifiable\r\nwar, promoted by one party and connived at by the other, than the late\r\nwar with Mexico.\"\r\n\r\nThe prevention of war was a subject which had occupied the mind of Judge\r\nJay for a number of years. The result of his reflections was that system\r\nof international arbitration which has become since his death so\r\nefficacious a method of settling international disputes. A pamphlet\r\nentitled \"War and Peace: the Evils of the First and a Plan for\r\nPreserving the Last\" was still in manuscript in his desk when, in 1841,\r\nJoseph Sturge, the celebrated English philanthropist, visited Bedford.\r\nJay read the pamphlet to Sturge, who was so much struck by the work that\r\nhe embodied a portion of it in a book which he published on his return\r\nto England. The views of Jay attracted the attention of the English\r\nPeace Society, who published the whole pamphlet in London in 1842. Jay's\r\nplan for the prevention of war was exceedingly simple. It provided that\r\na stipulation should be made in every treaty that future international\r\ndifferences should be referred first to arbitration, to attempt a\r\npeaceful settlement. The idea was heartily approved by Cobden, who wrote\r\nto Judge Jay: \"If your government is prepared to insert an arbitration\r\nclause in the pending treaties I am persuaded that it will be accepted\r\nby our government.\" The scheme of arbitration thus proposed by Jay, and\r\nsupported by Joseph Sturge and his friends of the English Peace Society,\r\nwas approved by peace congresses held in Brussels in 1848, in Paris in\r\n1849, and in London in 1851. Having thus attracted general attention, it\r\nwas recommended by protocol No. 23 of the Congress of Paris held in 1856\r\nafter the Crimean War, which protocol was unanimously adopted by the\r\nplenipotentiaries of France, Austria, Great Britain, Prussia, Russia,\r\nSardinia, and Turkey. These governments declared their wish that the\r\nStates between which any serious misunderstanding might arise should,\r\nbefore appealing to arms, have recourse, as far as circumstances might\r\nallow, to the good offices of a friendly power. The honour of the\r\nintroduction of this measure in the first Congress belongs to Lord\r\nClarendon, whose services had been solicited by Joseph Sturge and Henry\r\nRichard. It was subsequently referred to by Lord Derby as worthy of\r\nimmortal honour. Lord Malmsbury pronounced it an act \"important to\r\ncivilization and to the security of the peace of Europe.\" The protocol\r\nwas afterwards approved by all the other powers to which it was\r\nreferred, more than forty in number. The plan thus suggested by Judge\r\nJay for the prevention of war bore fruit during his life, and was\r\ndestined in after-years to become established in the mind of the\r\ncivilized world as the true remedy for the greatest scourge of\r\nnations.[D]\r\n\r\nJudge Jay was an earnest and active member of the Episcopal Church, but\r\nhe was never blind to its imperfections. He deplored as much as any man\r\nthe countenance given by the church to slavery, but he believed that\r\nreformation must and would come from within. He had no sympathy with the\r\n\"come-outers.\" Concerning them he wrote in 1846: \"Infidelity is now\r\nvigorously availing itself of the conduct of the clergy in relation to\r\nthis subject to assail the blessed religion of which they are the\r\nministers. A sect is forming who profess to believe that the church is\r\nso corrupted by slavery that good men are required to separate from her.\r\nThese people call themselves 'come-outers.' Lecturers are enlisted in\r\ntheir service, and the clergy, as identified with the cause of human\r\nbondage, are daily held up to public detestation as heartless\r\nhypocrites.\" Jay would not deny the justice with which the attacks on\r\nthe clergy were made, and he laboured to place the church where it\r\nbelonged, in the front rank of the great humanitarian movement. To his\r\nefforts were largely due the admission of coloured clergy to the\r\nconventions of the church, and the gradual abolition of that spirit of\r\ncaste which prevented a white clergyman from recognizing a black one as\r\nfit to deliberate with him on matters relating to their common\r\nreligion. To destroy this race hatred, so contrary to the spirit of\r\nChristianity, and to arouse the church to its duty of active opposition\r\nto slavery, were Jay's constant endeavours in the conventions of the\r\nchurch. His pen also was frequently occupied with the same subject. His\r\n\"Letter to Bishop Ives\" of North Carolina was a severe yet just\r\narraignment of clergymen who justified slavery from the Scriptures, and\r\nit exposed the wickedness of their course in language and with arguments\r\nto which they and their sympathizers were unable to reply.\r\n\r\nWhen a \"History of the American Church,\" by Samuel Wilberforce, was\r\npublished in England, there was naturally in America much curiosity to\r\nsee the work. Two American publishers announced their intention of\r\nreprinting it. But time passed and no reprint appeared. The explanation\r\nis given in the words of Jay: \"The author of the 'History' in the course\r\nof his work advances certain doctrines on the subject of 'slavery' and\r\nof 'caste in the church' which it is thought inconvenient to discuss,\r\nand which cannot be admitted in this republic without sealing the\r\ncondemnation of almost every Christian sect among us and overwhelming\r\nour own church with shame and confusion. There are, it is to be feared,\r\nbut few among our twelve hundred clergymen who, on reading the\r\n'History,' would not find their consciences whispering, 'Thou art the\r\nman,' and who would not be anxious to conceal the volume from their\r\nparishioners. Hence its suppression.\" Jay was determined that the\r\ntruths regarding the Episcopal Church in America set forth by the\r\ncelebrated Dr. Wilberforce should not be quite unattainable by the\r\nclergy and laity especially concerned. In 1846 he caused those passages\r\nof the \"History\" relating to slavery to be printed, and introduced them\r\nwith forcible remarks of his own in the pamphlet entitled \"A Reproof of\r\nthe American Church by the Bishop of Oxford.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: William Jay]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nUNPOPULARITY OF THE ABOLITIONISTS.--THE COMPROMISES OF 1850 AND THE\r\n  FUGITIVE-SLAVE LAW.--JAY'S REPLY TO WEBSTER'S 7th OF MARCH\r\n  SPEECH.--THE ATTITUDE OF THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH.--THE ABROGATION OF\r\n  THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE.--DISUNION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prospect was dark for the antislavery cause in 1850. Its friends had\r\nincreased steadily in numbers and in earnestness. But the Slave Power\r\nhad mustered all its forces in an aggressive campaign which aimed to\r\nmake slavery a national instead of a local institution, to introduce it\r\ninto territory hitherto free, and to browbeat the North into submission\r\nto every demand of the slaveholder. The compromise measures adopted this\r\nyear in Congress--above all, the Fugitive-Slave Law--marked the\r\nsuccessful advance of arrogant Southern dictation. In the North, the\r\ndislike of antislavery men and the willingness to satisfy the South at\r\nthe expense of conscience was expressed in such scenes as the attack of\r\nthe Rynders mob on the meeting of the American Antislavery Society in\r\nNew York and the passive attitude towards it adopted by the authorities.\r\nAlthough the plan of putting down the abolitionists by force had proved\r\nimpracticable, no efforts were spared to make their lives uncomfortable\r\nby the attacks of the press and by the pressure of social disapproval.\r\n\"Our politicians,\" wrote Jay to Charles Sumner, \"may pride themselves on\r\ntheir adroitness in pandering to popular prejudices, and in acquiring\r\npower and influence by seasonable changes of opinion and conduct. But a\r\nday is coming when their motives and actions will be judged by a very\r\ndifferent tribunal than public opinion, and when a single act of\r\nbenevolence, a single sacrifice of personal consideration to the cause\r\nof truth, will outweigh a whole life of obsequiousness and political\r\ntrickery.\r\n\r\n\"The truths we advocate are unpalatable to the two extremes of society.\r\nWe shock the coarse, vulgar prejudices of the rabble, while the\r\ndisinterested benevolence we profess is to them an enigma to be solved\r\nonly by the imputation of fanaticism. At the same time we disturb the\r\ntranquil consciences of the rich, thwart the calculations of politicans,\r\nand interrupt the harmony subsisting between our merchants and their\r\nSouthern customers. Hence the upper classes look upon us as impertinent\r\nand exceedingly ungenteel, and unfit to move in the higher circles. I\r\ncannot tell how far your personal experience coincides with mine, but\r\n_I_ know whereof I affirm. I have advanced no ultra-fanatical doctrines\r\nin politics or religion. On the subject of slavery I have but reiterated\r\nthe opinions of many of the best and greatest men in England and in our\r\nown country. I have advocated no congressional action except such as\r\nMr. Webster, in his better days, pronounced constitutional, and I have\r\ncondemned all forcible resistance to the Fugitive-Slave Law. Yet solely\r\non account of my antislavery efforts, I find myself nearly insulated in\r\nsociety.\"\r\n\r\nThe Compromise measures of 1850 were repulsive and disheartening to the\r\nantislavery men in the North. And no circumstance connected with them\r\nwas more discouraging than the change of front made by Daniel\r\nWebster--his abandonment of the Wilmot Proviso and his concession to the\r\nSouthern demand for the extension of slavery into the new territory\r\nacquired by the Mexican War. Webster's speech of the 7th of March was\r\nanswered by Judge Jay in a letter to the _Evening Post_ of March 20th,\r\nand was afterwards published as a pamphlet and widely circulated. In\r\nthis letter Jay recalled the eloquent and positive declaration of\r\nWebster made in the Senate on August 10, 1848, after New Mexico and\r\nCalifornia had been acquired:\r\n\r\n  \"My opposition to the increase of slavery in this country, or to the\r\n  increase of slave representation, is general and universal. It has\r\n  no reference to the lines of latitude or points of the compass. I\r\n  shall oppose all such extension at all times and under all\r\n  circumstances, even against all inducements, against all supposed\r\n  limitation of great interests, against all combinations, against all\r\n  compromises.\"\r\n\r\nThese words were contrasted by Jay with Webster's present excuse for\r\nabandoning opposition to the extension of slavery on the ground that the\r\nlaws of \"physical geography\" made slavery impossible in the new\r\nterritory and to forbid its existence there was merely \"to re-enact the\r\nwill of God.\"\r\n\r\n  \"To what,\" asked Jay, \"did this solemn, emphatic, unqualified\r\n  asservation refer? Did he then know that there was a foot of\r\n  territory in the United States over which it was morally and\r\n  physically impossible to extend slavery? Was he promising in these\r\n  impressive terms to oppose what he was conscious would never be\r\n  attempted? Did he make this pledge before his country with a mental\r\n  reservation to unite hereafter with General Cass and the\r\n  slaveholders in denouncing and scorning the Proviso? Did he mean to\r\n  deceive his own party? Did he desire to keep up an angry agitation\r\n  throughout the nation for electioneering purposes, and did he thus\r\n  intimate his belief in the danger of the extension of slavery and\r\n  slave representation, when he well knew that the fiat of the\r\n  Almighty had rendered such extension impossible? Was he then\r\n  acquainted with the law of physical geography which would render the\r\n  Proviso 'a re-enactment of the will of God?' And did he purposely\r\n  conceal the secret of this law in his own breast, when by revealing\r\n  it he might have stilled the raging billows of popular passion which\r\n  threatened to ingulf the Union? To suppose all this would be to\r\n  impute to Mr. Webster a degree of trickery and turpitude rarely\r\n  paralleled even among politicians. Hence we are bound to assume that\r\n  the law of nature on which he _now_ relies is a recent discovery,\r\n  subsequent at least to the 10th August, 1848. It is, however,\r\n  extraordinary that a gentleman of his acquirements did not sooner\r\n  become acquainted with '_this law of physical geography--the law of\r\n  the formation of the earth, that settles forever, beyond all terms\r\n  of human enactment, that slavery cannot exist in California or New\r\n  Mexico_.' It is to be regretted that Mr. Webster did not condescend\r\n  to demonstrate the existence of this law and to explain the mode of\r\n  its operation. He indeed tells us that our new territories are\r\n  'Asiatic in their formation and scenery'; but this fact does not\r\n  prove his law, since slavery has existed for ages amid the scenery\r\n  of Asia; it exists in the deserts of Africa, has existed in every\r\n  country of Europe, and now exists in the frozen regions of Russia.\r\n  This law, moreover, must have been enacted by the Creator since\r\n  1824, or its operation must have been suspended in deference to the\r\n  Spanish government; for under that government negro slavery did\r\n  exist in California and New Mexico, and it ceased in 1824, not by\r\n  the 'law of physical geography,' but by a Mexican edict. Thousands\r\n  of slaves are employed in the mines of Brazil, and Mr. Webster does\r\n  not explain how his law forbids their employment in the mines of\r\n  California....\r\n\r\n  \"He pays a sorry compliment to the common sense of the people in\r\n  offering to them at the eleventh hour a new and unheard-of law of\r\n  'physical geography,' together with the 'Asiatic scenery and\r\n  formation' of the conquered territories, as an _excuse_ for\r\n  violating the faith he had plighted in behalf of the Proviso. He has\r\n  shocked the moral sense of a large portion of the community by\r\n  giving in advance his sanction to the Fugitive-Slave Law, which\r\n  makes the liberty or bondage of a citizen depend on the affidavit of\r\n  a slaveholder and the judgment of a post-master--a law which\r\n  converts sympathy for guiltless misery into crime, and threatens to\r\n  tenant our jails with our most estimable men and women. But Mr.\r\n  Webster underrates the intelligence and sensibilities of the masses.\r\n  Relying on the Southern affinities of our commercial cities, on the\r\n  subserviency of politicians, on the discipline of party, and on his\r\n  own great influence, Mr. Webster looks _down_ upon the people; but\r\n  the time is probably not far distant when the people will cease to\r\n  look up to him. Parties will accept of any leaders who can acquire\r\n  for them the spoils of the day, but in the political history of our\r\n  country the people have never placed their affections upon any man\r\n  in whose stability and consistency they did not confide.\"\r\n\r\nTo give such assistance as he could to a fugitive slave had always been\r\nregarded by Judge Jay as a duty. \"The slaveholders,\" he had written,\r\n\"with their accustomed impudence and mendacity, apply the term _theft_\r\nto the humane and Christian efforts to assist a slave in escaping from\r\nhis home of bondage. In their sense of the expression, I glory in being\r\na slave-stealer, and I inculcate upon my children the duty, the\r\nChristian duty, of this kind of theft.\" He had sheltered and aided many\r\nrunaways at his home at Bedford, and his will contained a bequest of a\r\nthousand dollars to be used for this purpose. His son John gave his\r\nservices as a lawyer constantly and successfully to prevent the return\r\nof fugitive slaves.\r\n\r\nWhen the Fugitive-Slave Bill became a law Judge Jay was applied to by\r\nmany individuals, societies, and periodicals to give his views\r\nconcerning it. \"The law,\" he said in a private letter, \"is an outrage\r\nupon the Constitution of our country and the precepts of our religion.\r\nIt is a burlesque on justice and on all the acknowledged rules of\r\nevidence in the trial of issues. The demand it makes upon individual\r\ncitizens to aid in hunting and enslaving their fellow-men is diabolical.\r\nI have made up my mind to suffer imprisonment and the spoiling of my\r\ngoods rather than hazard my soul by rendering any active obedience to\r\nthis sinful law. It is horrible that so many of our fashionable cotton\r\ndivines are now preaching up the supremacy of human law and virtually\r\ndethroning Him whose ambassadors they profess to be.\"\r\n\r\n\"In my opinion, every Northern slave-catcher is a base man, and every\r\nlawyer who takes reward against the innocent is a disgrace to a noble\r\nprofession. I myself shall offer no forcible resistance against the\r\nexecution of this most wicked law, but I trust that, through the grace\r\nof God, I would go to the scaffold sooner than obey it.\"\r\n\r\nConcerning the constitutionality of the law, Judge Jay wrote to Josiah\r\nQuincy: \"The fugitive-slave clause in the Constitution is of course\r\nobligatory, but there is a wide distinction between the fugitive-slave\r\n_clause_ and the fugitive-slave _law_. The Constitution gives no power\r\nto Congress to legislate on the subject, but imposes on the States the\r\nobligation of rendition. Chief-Justice Hornblower, of New York, and\r\nChancellor Walworth, of New York, long since pronounced the fugitive law\r\nof '93 unconstitutional on this very ground.\"\r\n\r\nThe demoralization caused by the execution of the law was described by\r\nJay in a letter to Gerrit Smith: \"It is scoundrelizing our people.\r\nCruelty and injustice are cultivated as virtues, Christian love and\r\nsympathy with human suffering are treated as prejudices to be conquered,\r\nand zeal in hunting slaves is made the test of patriotism and of fitness\r\nfor office. But the most diabolical effect of the law is the competition\r\nit has excited among our politicians to offer the blood of their\r\nfellow-citizens in exchange for Southern votes.\"\r\n\r\nTo a committee of free coloured men who asked Judge Jay's advice\r\nregarding the propriety of arming themselves to prevent being kidnapped\r\nunder the law, he said: \"Most deeply do I sympathize with you in your\r\nunhappy state. With your wives and children, you are now placed at the\r\ndisposal of any villain who is ready to perjure himself for the price\r\nyou will bring in the human shambles of the South. With less ceremony\r\nand trouble than a man can impound his neighbour's ox, you may be\r\nmetamorphosed from a citizen of the State of New York into a beast of\r\nburden on a Southern plantation. On leaving your house in the morning\r\nyou may be enticed into another, where one of the newly appointed\r\ncommissioners, after reading one affidavit, made a thousand miles off,\r\nand another that you are the person named in the first, or on the bare\r\noath of the kidnapper himself, may inform you, to your amazement and\r\nhorror, that you are a _slave_. The fetters previously prepared are\r\nplaced on your limbs, and in a few minutes you are travelling with\r\nrailroad velocity to a Southern market. Never again will you behold your\r\nwife and children, nor will any tidings from them ever reach your ear.\r\nThe remainder of your life is to be one of toil and stripes.... Yet,\" he\r\ncontinued, \"leave, I beseech you, the pistol and the bowie-knife to\r\nSouthern ruffians and their Northern mercenaries. That this law will\r\nlead to bloodshed I take for granted, but let it be the blood of the\r\ninnocent, not of the guilty. If anything can arouse the torpid\r\nconscience of the North, it will be our streets stained with human blood\r\nshed by the slave-catchers.\"\r\n\r\nThe Fugitive-Slave Law, in Jay's opinion, was the natural sequence to\r\nthe attempt to put down the antislavery movement by force: \"For years,\r\nmost strenuous efforts, prompted by commercial and political views, were\r\nmade to deprive the opponents of slavery of their constitutional\r\nprivileges by lawless violence. The right of petition was suspended, the\r\nfreedom of debate interrupted, the sanctity of the post-office violated,\r\npublic meetings dispersed, printing-presses destroyed, furious mobs\r\nexcited, churches sacked, private houses gutted, and even murder\r\nperpetrated. All this violation of rights was regarded with complacency\r\nby many who had much at stake, so long as abolitionists alone were the\r\nvictims. But the spirit of aggression thus raised and fostered is\r\nseeking new subjects on which to exercise its power. 'Gentlemen of\r\nproperty and standing' are now beginning to feel alarmed about\r\nsocialism, anti-rentism, agrarianism, etc. Hence, of late we hear much\r\nof the importance of conservatism, as it is called. The political\r\nmovements of the last few months seem to indicate that our landlords and\r\ncotton lords and merchant princes regard an alliance with the\r\naristocracy of the South as at least in some degree a security against\r\nthe violation of vested rights, sequestration of rents, oppressive\r\ntaxation, unequal laws, etc. To the influence of gentlemen of this class\r\nthe late slave law owes its passage.\r\n\r\n\"And is it indeed believed that the rights of the rich will be protected\r\nby familiarizing the populace with the practice of injustice and cruelty\r\ntowards the poor? Will the sight of innocent men seized in our streets\r\nand sent in fetters to till the broad fields of great landowners\r\nincrease the reverence felt for land titles? Is it wise to give the\r\npeople practical lessons in the demolition of all the barriers raised by\r\nthe common law for the protection of the weak against the strong? Is it\r\ntrue conservatism to obliterate in the masses the sense of justice, the\r\nfeelings of humanity, the distinction between right and wrong?\"\r\n\r\nThe tacit support given to slavery by the Episcopal Church at large and\r\nthe active support given to it by many individual clergymen was a source\r\nof constant grief to Judge Jay and a frequent subject of his thoughts.\r\n\"You well know,\" he wrote to Joseph Sturge, \"what a mighty effort has\r\nbeen made by our Northern traders in Southern votes and merchandise,\r\nunder the leadership of Daniel Webster, to roll back the antislavery\r\ntide. To a certain extent they have succeeded. The commercial interest\r\nin the great towns, through a rivalry for the Southern trade, has\r\nprofessed great alacrity in slave-catching, and political aspirants for\r\noffice under the Federal Government find it expedient to make\r\nslave-hunting the test of patriotism. But the religious feeling of the\r\ncommonalty--that is, of those who are not pre-eminently gentlemen of\r\nproperty and standing--is shocked by the enormous cruelty and injustice\r\nof the fugitive law. To overcome this feeling, which in its\r\ndemonstrations is exceedingly inconvenient to our merchants and\r\noffice-seekers, the clergy have been urged by the press and other\r\nagencies to come out in support of the law--in other words, to give the\r\nsanction of the gospel of Christ to the enslavement of innocent men.\r\nSome pastors who preach in fine churches to rich and fashionable city\r\ncongregations have complied. You must understand that many of our\r\nbrokers, merchants, lawyers, and editors were exceedingly scandalized by\r\nthe opposition of religious people to this vile law, and they have\r\ntrembled for the honour of our holy religion when some of its professors\r\ncontended that an impious law was not binding on the conscience.\"\r\n\r\nThe position of the church was strongly stated by Jay in a letter to\r\nRev. Hiram Jelliff: \"It is one of the most melancholy circumstances of\r\nthe condition of the coloured people that so many of the ministers of\r\nthe Lord Jesus Christ are among their most influential enemies. The\r\nchurch of the living God is the great buttress of slavery and caste in\r\nthe United States. If any plea can be urged in behalf of infidelity, it\r\nis that Christianity as represented by multitudes of its official\r\nteachers authorizes the abrogation of all its precepts of humility,\r\njustice, and benevolence in the treatment of persons to whom God has\r\ngiven a coloured skin. Look at the conventions of New York and\r\nPennsylvania excluding ministers and disciples of the crucified Redeemer\r\nmerely because they are poor and despised! I confess, my dear sir, that\r\nwere I a young man, with no early religious impressions and about to\r\ndecide on the truth or falsehood of revelation, I fear I should be\r\nstrongly tempted to believe that a religion such as it is practically\r\nexhibited by your cotton-parsons could not and did not proceed from a\r\njust and benevolent being. I have had great opportunities of knowing the\r\neffect produced by the countenance given to slavery and caste by the\r\nchurch on the faith of many kind-hearted and conscientious people, and\r\nin all sincerity I declare that our pro-slavery clergy, our negro-hating\r\nclergy, our slave-catching clergy, are the most successful apostles of\r\ninfidelity in the country. I write thus freely to you because your\r\ncourse is in direct opposition to those I condemn. The Saviour eat,\r\ndrank, and lodged with the Samaritans, who were the negroes of Judea, a\r\ndespised, degraded caste, from whom a Jew disdained to receive even a\r\ncup of water.... May God bless and reward your labours.\"\r\n\r\nOccupying, as Judge Jay did, a position of leadership in both the\r\nEpiscopal Church and the antislavery movement, it was to him that men\r\nmost frequently turned for advice on subjects relating to the connection\r\nbetween the church and slavery. From mature minds, such as that of\r\nSenator Salmon P. Chase, from divinity students and young men\r\ncontemplating connection with a religious body, came inquiries\r\nregarding the duty of joining the church or of remaining a member. To a\r\nyoung man Jay wrote in 1854: \"I shall say nothing of the claims of the\r\nEpiscopal Church as arising from her doctrines, forms, and government,\r\nexcept that I know of no church which, judged _by its authorized\r\nstandards_, is more scriptural and more conducive to holiness in this\r\nlife and to salvation in the next. You desire to enter this church but\r\nhave not been able to overcome the objection arising from its connection\r\nwith slavery, and would like to know, for your information, how I\r\nreconcile my continuance in this church with my antislavery opinions.\r\nAssuredly I could not belong to a church which exacted of its members an\r\nadmission of the lawfulness of human bondage. Of such a sin and folly\r\nthe Episcopal Church is guiltless. No sanction of slavery can be found\r\nin any of her standards, and hence I can very consistently hold the\r\ndoctrines of the church and join in its prayers and rites and at the\r\nsame time regard American slavery as the sum of all villainies. There\r\nare in the church slaveholding bishops, clergymen, and communicants,\r\n_plenty of them_. But I am not responsible for their presence.... There\r\nnever has been, and I suppose there never will be, a widely extended\r\nchurch without unworthy pastors and members. A _pure_ church composed of\r\nfallible and sinful men is a figment of the imagination.... Many popish\r\ndoctrines and practices are occasionally advocated by our Puseyites. But\r\nI, as a private member of the church, am in no degree responsible for\r\nthe heresies of Puseyism nor the more disgusting heresies of\r\ncotton-divinity.... In my opinion, in nine cases out of ten an\r\nantislavery Christian can do more good to his own soul, to the cause of\r\nChrist, and to the interests of the slave by remaining in his church and\r\nthere battling for truth and justice, than by going in search of a pure\r\nchurch. It often happens when an abolitionist abandons an alleged\r\npro-slavery church he finds no other that suits him. Hence the public\r\nworship of God and the Sacraments are neglected. Gradually he and his\r\nfamily learn to live without God in the world, and finally enter upon\r\nthat broad road which leads to destruction.\"\r\n\r\nThe position assumed by the Episcopal Church towards the rights and\r\nelevation of the blacks was indicated by the refusal of the Diocesan\r\nCouncil of New York to admit the coloured church of St. Philip, although\r\nthe parish was constitutionally entitled to be represented and her\r\nminister and delegates were entitled to seats and votes. Judge Jay\r\nopposed earnestly a majority report from a committee on the question of\r\ntheir admission, which contended that the applicants belonged to a race\r\n\"socially degraded, and improper associates for the class of persons who\r\nattend our conventions.\" Such an apology for the violation of the\r\nconstitutional rights ordained by the State, and such a presentation of\r\nthe theological views entertained by the committee on the unity of the\r\nchurch and the catholic brotherhood of its members, was not calculated\r\nto strengthen the opposition to St. Philip's; and the Christian world\r\nbreathed more freely when, after a nine years' struggle to obtain a vote\r\non the question maintained by Judge Jay and his son, the coloured parish\r\nwas admitted by a large majority of both orders.\r\n\r\nIn 1854 Southern aggression had nearly reached its culminating point.\r\nThe Missouri Compromise was abrogated; the Kansas-Nebraska Bill threw\r\nopen to slavery an immense territory hitherto free, under the subterfuge\r\ninvented by General Cass and Senator Douglas of \"popular sovereignty.\"\r\nSlavery was thus to extend over the vast regions in the centre of the\r\ncontinent. An indefinite number of new slave States were to be admitted\r\ninto the Union, which would give the control of the Senate, and\r\nconsequently of all legislation, forever to the Slave Power.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1854, Judge Jay received an invitation to address the\r\nAnti-Nebraska Convention of the Free Democracy of Massachusetts. His age\r\nand health prevented a journey to Boston, but he wrote to the committee\r\nof invitation as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"It is meet and right that the stupendous iniquity now about to be\r\n  perpetrated should be resisted by the true-hearted citizens of that\r\n  State which, more than any other in the confederacy, has debauched\r\n  the moral sentiment of the nation and prepared the community for\r\n  submission to the most insolent usurpation yet attempted by the\r\n  Slave Power. The present effort to extend the dominion of the whip\r\n  to the northern limits of the United States is the legitimate\r\n  consequence of the disastrous and disgraceful concessions of 1850.\r\n  Those concessions were effected more through the ability and\r\n  labours of the late distinguished senator from Massachusetts\r\n  than of any of his coadjutors. Mr. Webster, avowing the entire\r\n  constitutionality of the Wilmot Proviso and having voted for it in\r\n  relation to Oregon, objected to its application to the newly\r\n  conquered territories on the ground that their _Asiatic scenery_ and\r\n  _geographical conformation_ rendered it _physically impossible_ for\r\n  negro slavery ever to exist in them. Unhappily for his novel and\r\n  extraordinary theory, numerous slaves were at the time he spoke held\r\n  in California.... Slaves are at this day held in New Mexico.\r\n\r\n  \"Mr. Webster, in giving his earnest and cordial support to the\r\n  atrocious Fugitive-Slave Act, candidly acknowledged on the floor of\r\n  the Senate that in 'his judgment' Congress had no constitutional\r\n  power to legislate on the subject, the obligation of surrendering\r\n  fugitives resting on the States. Yet he scrupled not in his\r\n  subsequent addresses to speak in terms of unmeasured obloquy of\r\n  every lawyer who presumed to deny the constitutionality of that\r\n  horrible law. He admitted the right of Congress to grant the\r\n  fugitive a trial by jury, yet was unwearied in his advocacy of a law\r\n  denying to the most helpless of mortals that important safeguard of\r\n  personal liberty....\r\n\r\n  \"The course of this gentleman at a moment when the dearest\r\n  principles of liberty, justice, and humanity were vehemently\r\n  assailed was rapturously applauded by the monied, the literary, and\r\n  the ecclesiastical aristocracy of Massachusetts, and the New England\r\n  Church has to a great extent canonized his memory.\r\n\r\n  \"The ardour evinced by the city of Boston in the surrender of Simms,\r\n  and the intense servility and degradation accompanying that\r\n  surrender, together with the emphatic endorsement of Mr. Webster's\r\n  conduct, have exerted an influence in behalf of human bondage and\r\n  in derogation of Christian obligation far beyond the bounds of\r\n  Massachusetts. The moral bulwark raised at the North against slavery\r\n  in times past by the religious sentiment and the respect for the\r\n  rights of man is nearly demolished.\r\n\r\n  \"The Slave Power, taking advantage of the present paralysis of the\r\n  Northern conscience and the frantic cupidity of our demagogues and\r\n  merchants for Southern votes and Southern trade, is about placing\r\n  its yoke on willing and bending necks.\r\n\r\n  \"Think not that Nebraska is to be the terminus of slaveholding\r\n  encroachments. New slave States are from time to time to be carved\r\n  out of Mexico. Cuba is to be wrested from Spain and St. Domingo\r\n  re-enslaved and annexed. As the field for slave labour widens and\r\n  widens, the supply will be found inadequate to the demand. The\r\n  discovery will then be made that both religion and policy require\r\n  the repeal of the prohibition of the African slave-trade. We shall\r\n  be told of the Christian duty of bringing the pagans of Africa to\r\n  our own civilized shores and of preparing them for heaven by the\r\n  discipline of the whip and the teachings of slave-drivers, while\r\n  politicans and political economists will insist on the removal of\r\n  the restriction as essential to the development of our national\r\n  wealth and enterprise. In vain will Virginia and the other breeding\r\n  States strive to retain their present lucrative monopoly of the\r\n  human shambles. The cotton and sugar States, together with the newly\r\n  acquired slave States, aided by Northern politicians, will establish\r\n  free trade in the bodies and souls of men.\r\n\r\n  \"The Southern Church is almost without exception the unblushing\r\n  champion of slavery, while the Northern Church, adopting a\r\n  time-serving, heartless, and often hypocritical neutrality, and\r\n  holding in its fraternal embrace slave-breeders and slave-traders,\r\n  has virtually taught that the vilest outrages on both the civil and\r\n  religious rights of the black man are perfectly compatible with the\r\n  highest sanctity in his white oppressor. Some of our religious\r\n  journals are sadly grieved and scandalized by the alleged discovery\r\n  that certain opponents of slavery are infidels. For my own part, I\r\n  know of no form of infidelity so hideous as that which impiously\r\n  claims the authority of Almighty God for abrogating all His laws in\r\n  behalf of justice and mercy in reference to our conduct towards\r\n  millions of our countrymen not of the same colour as ourselves. This\r\n  cutaneous Christianity, so insulting to the Deity, so disastrous to\r\n  man, is fast becoming the national religion.\r\n\r\n  \"The present crisis is indeed an awful one. While various causes\r\n  have aided in producing it, its immediate origin is to be traced to\r\n  the lamentable defection, in 1850, of so many of the rich and\r\n  influential from truth and justice, liberty and humanity, under the\r\n  fallacious plea of saving the Union. Well may the Free Democracy of\r\n  Massachusetts, with their hands and consciences undefiled by\r\n  oblations on the altar of the American Moloch, now strive to avert\r\n  the calamity impending over the country. May a long-suffering God\r\n  bless their efforts and rescue a guilty nation from the punishment\r\n  it seems anxious to inflict upon itself.\"\r\n\r\n\"As to the wickedness of the whole Kansas business,\" Jay wrote to\r\nCharles Sumner, in March, 1856, \"I most fully agree with you, and I do\r\nnot wonder that amid such abounding iniquity you are at a loss what\r\natrocity to assail first. I am very much inclined to look upon every\r\nNorthern member of Congress who voted for the repeal of the Missouri\r\nCompromise as a rascal. This may seem harsh--it is certainly not\r\npolite--and yet I am utterly unable to assign a good, honest, religious\r\nmotive for the vote, or to reconcile it with the fear of God or with\r\nlove to man.... Let us fight on, with all our heart and mind and soul.\r\nGod is with us, approves our efforts, and whether He shall crown them\r\nwith success or not, He will not forget our work of faith and labour of\r\nlove. I have full faith in an ultimate triumph, although you and I may\r\nnot live to enjoy it. My belief is, that as soon as the North ceases to\r\ntremble before the slave-drivers, the non-slaveholders of the South will\r\nproclaim their independence and insist upon free speech and a free\r\npress, and as soon as these are obtained the doom of slavery is sealed.\"\r\n\r\nThe repeal of the Missouri Compromise was the beginning of the end, the\r\nfatal step of the South on its road to destruction. Throughout the North\r\nthe conviction grew that Union and slavery could not exist much longer\r\ntogether. On the 4th of July, 1854, Garrison publicly burned a copy of\r\nthe Constitution of the United States with the words, \"The Union must be\r\ndissolved!\" He represented only an extreme sentiment. But the people at\r\nlarge began to calculate the value of this Union for which so many\r\nsacrifices had been made. Slavery became odious to many persons hitherto\r\nindifferent to the subject, on the ground that it persistently and\r\nselfishly placed the Union in peril.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1857 Judge Jay received a circular calling for a\r\nNational Disunion Convention, to be held at Worcester, signed by T. W.\r\nHigginson, Wendell Phillips, Daniel Mann, and W. L. Garrison. To this\r\ncircular he replied at length, giving his views on the question of\r\nseparation as it then appeared to him.\r\n\r\n  \"The subject you propose for consideration,\" he said, \"has long been\r\n  to me one of deep and painful interest. Although fully conscious of\r\n  the many social, commercial, and political advantages derived from\r\n  the Federal Union, I am nevertheless convinced that it is at present\r\n  a most grievous moral curse to the American people. To the people of\r\n  the South it is a curse by fostering and strengthening and\r\n  perpetuating an iniquitous, corrupting institution. To the millions\r\n  of African descent among us it is a curse by riveting the chains of\r\n  the bondman and deepening the degradation of the free man. To the\r\n  people of the free States it is a curse by tempting them to trample\r\n  under foot the obligations of truth, justice, and humanity for the\r\n  wages of iniquity with which the Federal Government has so\r\n  abundantly rewarded apostates from liberty and righteousness.\r\n\r\n  \"In my opinion, while the Union continues to be thus a curse it will\r\n  be indissoluble; if it ever ceases to be a curse, it will be\r\n  converted into a blessing.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"What possible reason have you to expect that those in church and\r\n  state who have surrendered their consciences to the seductions of\r\n  the Union will listen to your call and aid you in breaking a power\r\n  which they glory in saving? While I believe you are doomed to\r\n  disappointment, I nevertheless rejoice in every exposure of the\r\n  demoralizing influence of the Union. I rejoice in such exposure, not\r\n  as tending to bring about dissolution, but to render it unnecessary.\r\n  When the people of the North cease to idolize the Union, they will\r\n  cease to offer on its altar their rights and their duties. When\r\n  released from their thraldom to the Slave Power, they will cease to\r\n  place its minions in office. When no longer covetous of the votes\r\n  and the trade of the South, they will no longer be bullied into all\r\n  manner of wretchedness and all manner of insult by the idea and\r\n  ever-repeated threats of dissolution. But when this happy time\r\n  arrives, the Union will be converted from a curse into a blessing.\r\n  Our divines, instead of vindicating cruelty and oppression, and\r\n  denouncing as fanatics those who consider the will of God a higher\r\n  law than an accursed act of Congress, will become preachers of\r\n  righteousness. Democrats, seeing the Federal patronage wielded by\r\n  the opponents of slavery, will, in the rapidity and extent of their\r\n  conversion to truth and justice, eclipse all the marvels of New\r\n  England revivals; and men who for years have been bowed to the earth\r\n  by spinal weakness will as by miracle stand erect. When all this\r\n  happens, the North will continue its Union with the South; and you\r\n  yourselves will have no wish to see that Union severed.\r\n\r\n  \"At the close of the war, Washington, solicitous that the divine\r\n  favour might rest on the new-born nation, publicly offered the\r\n  prayer that God would dispose us all to do justice and love mercy.\r\n  May the Union, when exerting an influence in accordance with this\r\n  prayer, be indissoluble; but may God forbid that it may ever be\r\n  saved by promoting, extending, and perpetuating injustice and\r\n  cruelty, by invoking the wrath of Heaven, and becoming a proverb and\r\n  a reproach among the nations of the earth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nDEATH OF JUDGE JAY.--HIS POSITION AMONG ANTISLAVERY MEN.--HIS OTHER\r\n  PUBLIC AND PHILANTHROPIC INTERESTS.--HIS PRIVATE LIFE.--HIS\r\n  CHARACTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nJudge Jay was not destined to live to see the triumph of the antislavery\r\ncause and of the constitutional principles to which he had devoted his\r\nlife. Several years of failing health preceded his death, which took\r\nplace at Bedford, October the 14th, 1858.\r\n\r\nHis career in the antislavery cause, dating from the Missouri Compromise\r\nin 1821, was in several respects unique, and among the leaders of the\r\nmovement his position continued to be distinctive.\r\n\r\nHis first active efforts in favour of the slave, the presentation to\r\nCongress in 1826 of petitions for the abolition of slavery in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, were marked by a careful regard to the provisions\r\nof the United States Constitution. At the first formation of antislavery\r\nsocieties he feared that philanthropic enthusiasm might place the\r\nmovement in a wrong position by a failure to recognize those provisions.\r\nHis advice was asked by the men who organized the American Society in\r\nPhiladelphia, and it was carried into effect by the insertion into the\r\nconstitution of the society of a complete recognition of the supreme\r\nnational law, in strict accordance with which, only, the objects of the\r\nsociety should be sought. To maintain the abolitionists in the\r\nimpregnable position thus adopted was the constant and characteristic\r\nlabour of Jay's life. This position, consistently held by him against\r\nunconstitutional doctrines advanced by both abolitionists and\r\nslaveholders, was the position adopted by the Republican party in 1854,\r\nand maintained until real union and real liberty were won together.\r\n\r\nThe antislavery movement was begun and supported by those whom Lincoln\r\ncalled \"the plain people.\" Men of \"property and standing\" were generally\r\npassively if not actively hostile. It received little help from the\r\nchurches, from the learned professions or the wealthy mercantile\r\nclasses. It was a very unpopular cause, denounced by politicians,\r\nmerchants, and lawyers, despised by many of the clergy, certain to bring\r\nsocial and business injury, if not active persecution, to whomsoever\r\nadopted it. Hence the championship of William Jay derived a special\r\nimportance. His judicial and social position, his independent means, his\r\nactive membership in the most aristocratic of churches, made him a\r\nleader of peculiar value. His advocacy of the cause could be attributed\r\nneither to ignorant fanaticism nor to disorganizing tendencies. He set\r\nan example to the class most able and least willing to oppose the curse\r\nof slavery.\r\n\r\nA third peculiarity of Jay's position among antislavery men was the\r\nnature of the work which he performed. Without health sufficient to make\r\nlong journeys at a time when travelling was difficult, seldom leaving\r\nhis country home, he was rarely seen at the meetings and conventions of\r\nthe abolitionists. He was a voice, speaking words of reason, moderation\r\nand authority in times of blind excitement; a voice which spoke at the\r\nright moment and was always heard with respect. Jay's activity lay in\r\nhis pen. In a crisis when the judicious course of action or the accurate\r\nview of events was obscured by doubt and passion, a pamphlet or a public\r\nletter from Judge Jay cast a clear and steady light. His writings were\r\nconsulted by the most eminent men when considering subjects connected\r\nwith slavery. Of this a notable instance was the use made of Jay's\r\nargument on the \"Amistad\" case by John Quincy Adams when addressing the\r\nHouse of Representatives in that celebrated cause. These writings form a\r\ncontinuous and lucid commentary on the history of the long and varied\r\nstruggle between the forces of slavery and of freedom.\r\n\r\nThe published works of Judge Jay present but a part of the fruits and\r\nthe influence of his pen. His correspondence was voluminous and extended\r\nto the rank and file as well as to the leaders of the antislavery\r\nmovement. Constant resort was made to him for information and advice,\r\nwhich was always given with frankness and care.[E]\r\n\r\nWe may close appropriately our review of Jay's antislavery work with\r\nremarks made after his death to the coloured people of New York by\r\nFrederick Douglass, who escaped from the slave-driver to urge with\r\nnative eloquence the emancipation of his race: \"In common with you, my\r\nfriends, I wear the hated complexion which William Jay never hated. I\r\nhave worn the galling chain which William Jay earnestly endeavoured to\r\nbreak. I have felt the heavy lash, and have experienced in my own person\r\nthe cruel wrongs which caused his manly heart to melt in pity for the\r\nslave.... In view of the mighty struggle for freedom in which we are now\r\nengaged, and the tremendous odds arrayed against us, every coloured man\r\nand every friend of the coloured man in this country must deeply feel\r\nthe great loss we have sustained in this death, and look around with\r\nanxious solicitude for the man who shall rise to fill the place now made\r\nvacant. With emphasis it may be said of him, he was our wise counsellor,\r\nour firm friend, and our liberal benefactor. Against the fierce onsets\r\nof popular abuse he was our shield; against governmental intrigue and\r\noppression he was our learned, able, and faithful defender; against\r\nthe crafty counsels of wickedness in high places, where mischief is\r\nframed by law and sin is sanctioned and supported by religion, he was a\r\nperpetual and burning rebuke.\"\r\n\r\nBesides his work for the negro race, William Jay had various public and\r\nphilanthropic interests. Prominent among these were the duties of judge\r\nof Westchester County, which he exercised for more than twenty-five\r\nyears. Jay revised the rules of the court, which had been handed down\r\nalmost unchanged since 1728; and he introduced a strict observance of\r\nforms, which, combined with his prompt and explicit decisions, made the\r\nWestchester court one of the most dignified in the country. The sittings\r\nwere held alternately at White Plains and at Bedford, the half-shire\r\ntowns of the county. Jay also attended to chamber business in other\r\ntowns. At that period the Westchester bar embraced many lawyers of\r\nmarked ability, such as R. R. Voorhis, Aaron Ward, William Nelson, Peter\r\nJay Munro, J. W. Strong, Minot Mitchell, and James Smith; and from New\r\nYork, Alexander McDonald, William M. Price, and Peter Augustus Jay\r\nfrequently appeared among them. It has been said of Judge Jay's charges\r\nto grand juries that \"they commanded attention, from their clear\r\nexposition of the law without the slightest concession to the popular\r\ncurrents of the day and with careful regard to constitutional rights,\r\nmorality, and justice.\" These charges were frequently requested for\r\npublication as timely reminders of legal and moral truths, the relation\r\nof which to current events was being overlooked. Judge Jay's conduct on\r\nthe bench caused his reappointment term after term by governors of\r\nopposing political parties; and after his death, when a pro-slavery\r\nfaction endeavoured to remove his portrait from the court-house at White\r\nPlains, members of the bar who disagreed with Jay's abolition opinions\r\nwere foremost in preventing any act of disrespect to his memory.\r\n\r\nJay's philanthropy was religious in its motive and practical in its\r\nactivity. A life-long worker in the cause of temperance, his efforts\r\nproduced substantial results, as in the legislation proposed by him\r\nwhich forbade the sale of intoxicating liquors on credit.\r\n\r\nFor many years a member and president of the Peace Society, he was not\r\nsatisfied with exposing the evils of war. His mind sought and found a\r\nremedy for it in the system of international arbitration, of which the\r\npracticability was immediately acknowledged, and towards which the\r\ncivilized world has since turned with constantly growing confidence.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the American Bible Society in the face of the\r\nopposition of the authorities in his own church displayed in Jay's early\r\nlife the self-reliance and independence of character which gave so much\r\nstrength to his later career. Always true to his church, he never\r\ncompromised his convictions to fit a position in which that church was\r\nuntrue to itself. During the antislavery movement the churches were\r\nhostile. Fearful of alienating their Southern members and the Northern\r\nmen whose business interests demanded subserviency to the Slave Power,\r\nhardly any ecclesiastical organization was guiltless of lending a\r\npassive support to slavery. Theological students, on leaving their\r\nseminary, were cautioned by their instructors to avoid the troublesome\r\ntopic if they would be successful ministers of Christ. Clergymen who\r\npreached that property in man was sinful were disciplined by\r\necclesiastical superiors or cast off by outraged Christian\r\ncongregations. An orthodox religious newspaper was the safest printed\r\nmatter for a Northern man to have in his possession when travelling in\r\nthe South. The Episcopal Church had its slaveholding bishops and\r\nministers, not a few of whom justified slavery from the Scriptures. It\r\nhad in the North its \"cotton divines,\" who enjoined from the pulpit\r\nobedience to the odious law which sought to make slave-catchers of\r\nChristian men and women. It went so far as persistently to infringe its\r\nown laws by shutting the doors of its conventions upon legally chosen\r\ndelegates of congregations composed of free coloured men. The church of\r\nChrist was turned into a social club which did not hesitate to exclude a\r\nblack man as an \"unfit associate.\" Shocked at this attitude, many\r\nconscientious men withdrew from the communion. But such a course was\r\ninconsistent with Jay's character. False and repulsive as was to him\r\nsuch a conception of the Christian religion, he refused, as a churchman,\r\nto accept it. He remained in the ranks, striving by his own conduct to\r\nshow that a man could be a good churchman and hate slavery at the same\r\ntime. Fearless in his expression of Christian truth, he was for twenty\r\nyears a thorn in the side of pro-slavery churchmen, and a rallying-point\r\nfor those who understood better the spirit of Christianity and\r\nrecognized the brotherhood of man before God.\r\n\r\nJay's private life was happy and peaceful. The library at Bedford, with\r\nits book-shelves crowded to the ceiling and its windows looking out over\r\nthe hills of Westchester to the blue outlines of the Catskills, claimed\r\na considerable portion of every day. The hours there passed in\r\nreflection and in literary labour were hours of pleasure, enhanced by\r\nthe desire and the hope of usefulness.\r\n\r\nOut-of-doors were the avocations of a country life, which Jay was well\r\nconstituted to enjoy: the farm, with its interesting record of crops and\r\ngrowing livestock; the garden, where a great variety of flowers and\r\nvegetables flourished within hedges of old box; the lawn, with its trees\r\nplanted by his father and himself--all these gave occupation in pleasing\r\ncontrast to that of the library. The public roads in the neighbourhood\r\nof the Jay farm are now adorned and shaded by noble trees planted by the\r\nJudge. Along these roads and over the Westchester hills he loved to ride\r\non horseback, an exercise and pleasure which he enjoyed until the last\r\nyear of his life. Judge Jay preferred to consider Bedford as a farm\r\nrather than as a country seat, and he observed to Bishop Coxe in this\r\nregard that a farm without a gate or a fence out of repair was more to\r\nhis taste than an ornamental estate. The weak eyesight and somewhat\r\ndelicate health which in his youth seemed a misfortune as debarring him\r\nfrom a career of activity in the city turned in the end to his\r\nadvantage. A happier life than that at Bedford could hardly have been\r\ndevised for him; and it is probable that the studious retirement of his\r\ncountry library gave to his views on public questions a thoroughness and\r\nmoderation greater than could have been attained amidst the hurry and\r\ndistraction of a great city.\r\n\r\nIn his family relations, Jay was still more fortunate. His wife lived to\r\nbe his sympathetic companion until 1856, when he himself was near his\r\nend. Her accomplishments, especially in reading and drawing, her grace,\r\ngentleness, and goodness, her natural charity, added immeasurably to the\r\nhappiness of Jay's life. \"I have always regarded her,\" said the late\r\nRev. J. W. Alexander, \"as one of the happiest specimens of a Christian\r\nlady that it has been my lot to meet. Intelligent, graceful, pious,\r\ngentle, sportive in the right place, generous and catholic, she awakened\r\na sincere respect and attachment, and our memory of her is blessed.\" The\r\nlate Bishop Horatio Potter of New York, speaking of her later life,\r\nsaid: \"The serene composure, the sweet simplicity and dignity, bespoke a\r\npeaceful and elevated spirit, and made an impression on the most\r\ntransient visitor never to be effaced.\" Dr. John Henry Hobart, son of\r\nthe Bishop, wrote to John Jay: \"Your mother, always gentle, placid, and\r\ncheerful, with an unfailing smile and pleasant words for her young\r\nguests, sympathizing with their boyish enthusiasm for poetry and\r\nromance, and tempering their ardour with counsel and caution, which her\r\nown sensitive spirit conveyed in the most delicate forms--of her I must\r\nspeak thus feelingly; it only indicates the debt of gratitude I owe to\r\nher memory.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Augusta Jay]\r\n\r\nJudge Jay had one brother, Peter Augustus Jay, who was thirteen years\r\nhis senior. Between the brothers there continued through life an\r\nuninterrupted affection and confidence. Peter Augustus led an active\r\nprofessional and social life in New York City, holding office as judge,\r\nas recorder, and as a member of the State Assembly. On his death, in\r\n1843, high tributes to his ability as a jurist and to his character as a\r\npublic-spirited citizen were paid by Chancellor Kent, Chief-Justice\r\nSamuel Jones, and David B. Ogden. As a member of the Assembly, he was\r\nconspicuous in the advocacy of various important measures, among which\r\nmay be mentioned his efforts to extend the right of suffrage to black\r\ncitizens of the State. Peter Augustus Jay was not himself prominent in\r\nthe antislavery cause, but he was generally in sympathy with his\r\nbrother's work.\r\n\r\nThe Right Reverend A. Cleveland Coxe, Bishop of Western New York, was a\r\nfrequent visitor in his youth at Bedford. Some extracts from a letter\r\nwritten by him to John Jay afford an interesting view of the domestic\r\nlife of the Judge's home:\r\n\r\n\"William Jay was one of those true sons of the Republic who inherited\r\nsound views of its constitutional system from your illustrious\r\ngrandfather, and from personal acquaintance with some other fathers of\r\nthe nation who were high in the confidence of Washington and shared his\r\njust and lofty ideas of national policy. Your father was one of those\r\nborn statesmen who breathed under the inspiration of such ideas, and was\r\nanimated by them to efforts for the preservation of the Constitution\r\nitself in degenerate days. Those were the days when the 'spoils-system'\r\nhad begun to act with corrosive effect on public affairs and public men.\r\nThe science of true statesmanship seemed ready to perish. The country\r\nfell into the hands of mere politicians, with whom legislation was a\r\ntrade and a struggle for personal aggrandizement. The epoch had little\r\nuse for men of pure patriotism, but your father, incapable of ambition\r\nor the pursuit of personal ends, stood aside and devoted himself with\r\nintrepidity to unpopular principles, of which he foresaw the utility,\r\nwhile he was hardly less prophetic of the cruel war which must be the\r\nconsequence of popular indifference and blindness to the national\r\nperils. He was little seen, but greatly felt, and has left a mark on the\r\ndiplomacy of his time which is a gain to humanity and to civilization.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot forget the charms of that domestic life which he made so\r\nattractive to his children and to the large circle of kindred and\r\nfriends who were admitted to its enjoyments. It was in 1836 that, with\r\nour beloved friend Hobart, I was invited to spend the Christmas\r\nholidays at Bedford. We were boys together at that time, and I remember\r\nto what hours we prolonged our recreations, with no other restriction\r\nthan your father's cheerful injunction, as he bade us good-night: 'Young\r\ngentlemen, please remember not to laugh too loudly; it might deprive\r\nsome of us of the sleep which you seem not to require for yourselves.'\r\nHow merrily we 'saw the old year out and the new year in,' that\r\nChristmas-tide! I often thought of Irving's 'Bracebridge Hall' as\r\nrealized in America, in the home of your happy boyhood. Year after year,\r\nwinter and summer, through college life, you led me to renew my holidays\r\nin Bedford. How much I learned from your father's condescension to\r\nboyhood in conversing with his boy-visitors as if they were men! He drew\r\nout our opinions and encouraged us to state them frankly when he\r\nsuspected that we had the boldness to prefer our crude ideas to his own\r\njudicial and grave conceptions of fact and principle. He played chess\r\nwith his youthful guests, but never permitted them to beat him, as that\r\nwould have been no compliment to lads who worked hard and wished to win\r\nin a fair game.\r\n\r\n\"I have rarely seen a household in which family life was ordered more\r\nparticularly with reference to religion. There was much of the Huguenot\r\nin the piety of the Judge, but nothing of the Puritan. Family prayers\r\nwere observed twice a day, the servants attending and sharing in the\r\nresponses. After-evening prayers in those early days, we enjoyed a few\r\ncotillons and contra-dances, Mrs. Jay presiding at the piano. And when\r\nthe ladies had withdrawn, chess-playing and other games occupied us, not\r\ninfrequently until after midnight. Sundays in the old homestead, after\r\nchurch-going, were like other days, save in the chastened cheerfulness\r\nof conversation and employment. A feature of Sunday evenings was the\r\ncustom for every member of the family to recite something in prose or\r\npoetry, and the Judge often closed such recitals by reading selections\r\nfrom Bishop Heber, Mr. Milman, and other favourites of those times. In\r\nthe third decade of this century, the daughters of 'the governor,' Mrs.\r\nBanyer and Miss Jay, were often the guests of their brother. They would\r\nhave been interesting figures in any society, and were eminent in New\r\nYork for their Christian virtues and devotion to every good work. The\r\nelder sister, born in Spain, seemed to preserve in her face and carriage\r\nsomething borrowed from her native climate, while Mrs. Banyer, born in\r\nFrance, was not less conspicuously marked by characteristics of her\r\nFrench ancestry. While the only son of Judge Jay is a recognized type of\r\nhis father's principles and character, his daughters not less resembled\r\ntheir mother--a lady whose memory I hold in very great respect, with an\r\naffectionate estimate of her worth as a beautiful example of her\r\ngracious sex, in all characteristics 'wherein there is virtue and\r\nwherein there is praise.'\r\n\r\n\"I feel, at this distance of time, that I owe much to the friendship of\r\nJudge Jay, apart from the pleasures it conferred upon me. How much he\r\ntaught me! How often his maxims led me to correct my faults, though he\r\nnever seemed to instruct, much less to rebuke! Even in his decline, and\r\nwhen he was nearing the end, he favoured me with an occasional letter.\r\nNeed I say that, while entirely free from cant and pharisaic\r\nprofessions, such letters were models of Christian submission, and not\r\nless of 'faith, hope, and charity'? I have frequently reflected upon\r\nthem as I find myself approaching the end. His lofty example leads me to\r\nsay with the inspired moralist: 'Mark the perfect man and behold the\r\nupright, for the end of that man is peace.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF JOHN JAY.

It had been called by members of the King, Duer,\r\nTownsend, Goodhue, Sedgwick, Field, Griswold, and Hyslop families\r\nand many leading merchants of New York. The call was subsequently\r\npresented by John Jay to the New York Historical Society, for\r\npreservation in its records. A letter was read from Chancellor Kent\r\ndenouncing the annexation of Texas without the consent of Mexico as\r\na breach of national faith which would be universally condemned.\r\nSpeeches were made by Theodore Sedgwick and D. D. Field. But the\r\nmost imposing feature of the manifestation was the presence in the\r\nchair of Albert Gallatin, the last survivor of Jefferson's cabinet,\r\nwho, despite his age and infirmities, had been carried to the\r\nmeeting to protest in his own name and in that of his historic chief\r\nagainst so flagrant a violation of national honour and public faith.\r\nThe appeal of Gallatin for a time promised to be successful. Van\r\nBuren, whose views had been doubtful, wrote, under its influence,\r\nhis letter to Hammett objecting to annexation. But an annexation\r\nmeeting was held in Richmond to counteract that at New York, and\r\nwhen the Democratic Convention met at Baltimore an adroit change of\r\npolicy in regard to nominations displaced Van Buren and nominated\r\nPolk.\r\n\r\n[D] The later history of international arbitration is set forth by\r\nSir Lyon Playfair in the _North American Review_ for December, 1890.\r\n\r\n[E] Among those with whom Judge Jay was most often in communication\r\nmay be mentioned: Arthur and Lewis Tappan, Rev. S. S. Jocelyn, Rev.\r\nA. A. Phelps, Robert Vaux, E. Wright, Jr., Joshua Leavitt, Samuel J.\r\nMay, Reuben Crandall, James G. Birney, Theodore Sedgwick, Beriah\r\nGreen, Gerrit Smith, John Scoble of England, Mrs. L. M. Child, Miss\r\nGrimke, Wm. Goodell, G. Bailey, Jr., Rev. Dr. Morrison of England,\r\nGov. R. W. Habersham, W. W. Anderson of Jamaica, W. I., Joseph\r\nSturge of England, Jabez D. Hammond, Geo. W. Alexander of England,\r\nWilliam Slade, John Quincy Adams, Wm. H. Seward, S. P. Chase, Prof.\r\nC.
