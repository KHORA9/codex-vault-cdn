S. A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe title of this volume must be regarded as suggestive rather than as\r\nstrictly accurate, for the beginnings of union are to be found farther\r\nback than 1783, and democracy in its largest sense has even yet been\r\nonly imperfectly realized. At the close of the Revolution, union was but\r\na name. What Metternich said of the Italy of his day might have been\r\nsaid of the United States in 1783: it was only a geographical\r\nexpression. The formation of the new federal union under the\r\nConstitution is properly the main, though not the sole, theme of this\r\nvolume. Behind the thirteen Atlantic communities lay a vast region which\r\nalmost at once invited the colonizing activities of the people. The rise\r\nof this western world is a movement of immense significance. Out of the\r\nbosom of the West emerged the new democracy which transformed the face\r\nof society in the old States. Whether viewed economically or\r\npolitically, this forms the second theme in any history of the times.\r\nAround these two movements, therefore, I have endeavored to group the\r\nevents of forty-five years.\r\n\r\nWithin the last few years special studies have added much to the common\r\nstock of historical information, and in many ways effected changes in\r\nthe historian's point of view. The time seemed proper to restate the\r\nsalient factors in the history of this formative period. I have frankly\r\nappropriated the labors of others. Had the plan of the series permitted\r\nthe use of footnotes, I would gladly have made particular acknowledgment\r\nof my indebtedness. At the same time I have not hesitated to present the\r\nresults of my own studies where they have led away from the conventional\r\nview of men and events.\r\n\r\nIn preparation of the maps showing the popular vote in the elections of\r\n1800 and 1824, I have drawn largely upon the data which Dr. Charles O.\r\nPaullin, of the Carnegie Institution, has generously put at my disposal.\r\nIn States where the presidential electors were not chosen directly by\r\nthe voters, other votes, such as those for governor, have been made the\r\nbasis for determining the popular choice among party candidates for the\r\npresidency. Two of my graduate students, Miss Isabel S. Mitchell and Mr.\r\nJoseph E. Howe, have given me valuable assistance in the execution of\r\nthe maps. I am under particular obligation to my colleague, Professor\r\nStewart L. Mims, for reading critically both manuscript and proof.\r\n\r\n                                                 Allen Johnson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n    I.

As colonizers of a new world they were\r\nconfident in their own strength. When once the shackles of the British\r\nmercantile system were shaken off, they did not doubt their ability to\r\ncompete for the markets of the world. Even Washington, who had fewer\r\nillusions than most of his contemporaries, told his fellow citizens of\r\nAmerica that they were \"placed in the most enviable condition, as sole\r\nlords and proprietors of a vast tract of continent, comprehending all\r\nthe various soils and climates of the world, and abounding with all the\r\nnecessaries and conveniences of life.\" Independence was the magic word\r\nwhich the common man believed would open wide the gates of prosperity.\r\nYet within a year after the ratification of the Peace of Paris, American\r\nsociety was in the throes of a severe industrial depression.\r\n\r\nContrary to the accepted view, the latter years of the war were not\r\nyears of penury and want among the people. Outside of those regions of\r\nVirginia and the Carolinas, which were devastated by the marching and\r\ncountermarching of the combatants, the people were living in comparative\r\ncomfort. North of the Potomac, indeed, there was even a tendency to\r\nspeculation in business and extravagance in living. Throughout the war\r\nfarmers had found a ready market for their produce within the lines of\r\nthe British and French armies. The temporary suspension of commerce had\r\nencouraged many forms of productive industry. As the war continued,\r\nventuresome skippers eluded British men-of-war and found their way to\r\nEuropean or Dutch West India ports, bringing home rich cargoes in\r\nexchange for tobacco, flour, and rice. The prizes brought in by\r\nprivateers added largely to the stock of desirable and attractive\r\nmerchandise in the shops of Boston, Philadelphia, and Charleston. If\r\nsuch prosperity could follow in the wake of war, what commercial gains\r\nmight not be expected in the piping times of peace? In anticipation of\r\nimmediate returns, merchants drew heavily upon their foreign creditors\r\nand stocked their shops with imported commodities. Southern planters\r\nindulged similar expectations and bought land and slaves on credit,\r\nregardless of the price. \"A rage for running in debt became epidemical,\"\r\nwrote a contemporary observer. \"Individuals were for getting rich by a\r\n_coup de main_; a good bargain--a happy speculation--was almost every\r\nman's object and pursuit.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the hard times of 1785-86 these golden dreams vanished. Instead\r\nof sharing as the people of an independent nation in the trade and\r\ncommerce of the world, American shippers found themselves no better off\r\nthan they were as dependents of Great Britain. Orders in council at once\r\nclosed the ports of the British West Indies to all staple products which\r\nwere not carried in British bottoms. Certain commodities,--fish, pork,\r\nand beef,--which might compete with the products of British\r\ndependencies, were excluded altogether. The policy of France and Spain\r\nwas scarcely less illiberal. The effect was immediate. Cut off from\r\ntheir natural markets, American shipowners were forced either to leave\r\ntheir vessels to rot at their wharves or to seek new markets. For months\r\nthere seemed to be no other alternative. At the same time the new\r\nindustries which had sprung up during the war had to meet the shock of\r\nforeign competition, as the British manufacturer dumped on American\r\nwharves the accumulated stock of his warehouses. The plight of the small\r\nfarmer and of the large planter was much the same; for both had incurred\r\ndebts in expectation of continued prosperity.\r\n\r\nEverywhere people complained of hard times. Discouragement and ill-humor\r\ndisplaced the buoyant optimism with which peace had been heralded. \"What\r\nis independence?\" asked a writer in _A Shorter Catechism_. \"Dependence\r\nupon nothing\" was the cynical answer. In many States the popular\r\ndiscontent found vent in a vindictive crusade against the Tories. Even\r\nsober-minded citizens shared the general detestation of these\r\nunfortunate people. In the heat of war Washington had declared them to\r\nbe \"abominable pests of society\" who ought to be hanged as traitors.\r\nThe States had quite generally confiscated their property and in some\r\ncases had passed acts of attainder against them. In communities like New\r\nYork, which had long remained in the hands of the British, the popular\r\nanimosity was exceedingly bitter. To aid those citizens who had been\r\ndispossessed of their estates, the legislature passed the Trespass Act,\r\nwhich permitted suits for the recovery of property that had passed into\r\nthe hands of the enemy upon the flight of the owners. The terms of the\r\nact were in flat contradiction to the treaty of peace. Further to aid\r\nclaimants, it was provided that no military order could be pleaded in\r\ncourt in justification of the seizure of property.\r\n\r\nIn a famous case brought before the Mayor's Court of New York by the\r\nwidow Rutgers to recover her property from Joshua Waddington, a wealthy\r\nTory, Alexander Hamilton appeared as counsel for the defendant. It was a\r\ndaring act which brought down upon him the unmitigated wrath of the\r\nradical elements. Nevertheless, in an opinion which has considerable\r\ninterest for students of constitutional law, the court ruled that the\r\nTrespass Act, \"by a reasonable interpretation,\" must be construed in\r\nharmony with the treaty of peace, which was obligatory upon every State.\r\nIt was not to be presumed that the legislature would intentionally\r\nviolate the law of nations. The judgment of the court therefore, was in\r\nfavor of the defendant. With chagrin and resentment the popular party\r\ndeclared that the court had set aside a law of the State and had\r\npresumed to set itself above the legislature. Wherever the radicals got\r\nthe upper hand, confiscation was the order of the day; and even where\r\nthe conservatives succeeded in restraining their radical brethren from\r\nlegislative reprisals, no Tory was safe from the assaults of\r\nirresponsible mobs. Thousands took refuge in flight, to the infinite\r\ndelight of the wits in the coffee-houses who jested of the \"Independence\r\nFever\" which was carrying off so many worthy people.\r\n\r\nFinancially the Confederation was hopelessly embarrassed. Having sowed\r\nthe wind by its issues of bills of credit, it was now reaping the\r\nwhirlwind. By the end of the war this paper money had so far depreciated\r\nthat it ceased to pass as currency. \"Not worth a continental\" has passed\r\ninto our native idiom. Without power to levy taxes, Congress could only\r\nmake requisitions upon the States. The returns were pitifully inadequate\r\nto the needs of government. All told, less than a million and a half of\r\ndollars came into the treasury between 1781 and 1784, although Morris,\r\nas Superintendent of Finance, had earnestly besought the governors of\r\nthe States for two millions for the year 1783 alone, in order to meet\r\noutstanding obligations and current expenses. Without foreign and\r\ndomestic loans the war could never have been carried to a successful\r\nconclusion; but in 1783 even that source was drained. In sheer\r\ndesperation Congress authorized the Superintendent of Finance to draw\r\nbills of exchange, at his discretion, upon the credit of loans _which\r\nwere to be procured_ in Europe. In vain Morris warned Congress that no\r\nmore loans could be secured. \"Our public credit is gone,\" he declared.\r\n\r\nThe obvious remedy for the financial ills of the Confederation was to\r\ngive Congress the power to levy taxes. Early in 1781, indeed, before the\r\nArticles of Confederation had been ratified by Maryland, the proposal\r\nhad been made that Congress should be vested with power to levy a five\r\nper cent duty on imports; but the obstinate opposition of Rhode Island\r\neffectually blocked the amendment. \"She considered it the most precious\r\njewel of sovereignty that no State be called upon to open its purse but\r\nby the authority of the State and by her own officers.\" Again, in 1783,\r\nCongress submitted to the States an amendment which would confer upon it\r\nthe power to place specific duties for a term of twenty-five years upon\r\ncertain classes of imported commodities. The tardy response of the\r\nStates to this proposal left little hope that it would be adopted.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the Confederation and its woes hardly occupied the thoughts of\r\nthe people at all, except as a subject for jest and ridicule. The\r\nnewspapers made merry over the peregrinations of Congress. Frightened\r\naway from Philadelphia by the riotous conduct of some troops of the\r\nPennsylvania line, who had imbibed too freely, the delegates had\r\nwithdrawn first to Princeton and then to Annapolis. Thither Washington\r\nrepaired to resign his commission; but even so notable an occasion as\r\nthis brought together delegates from only seven of the States. The best\r\ntalent in America was drafted into the service of the several States.\r\nMen had ceased to think continentally. \"A selfish habitude of thinking\r\nand reasoning,\" wrote one who styled himself Yorick, in the _New York\r\nPacket_, \"leads us into a fatal error the moment we begin to talk of the\r\ninterests of America. The fact is, by the interests of America we mean\r\nonly the interests of that State to which property or accident has\r\nattached us.\" \"Of the affairs of Georgia,\" Madison confessed in 1786, \"I\r\nknow as little as those of Kamskatska.\"\r\n\r\nOn all sides intelligent men agreed that the return of prosperity\r\ndepended upon the opening-up of foreign trade. Their immediate concern\r\nwas the recovery of old markets. When John Adams went to London in 1785\r\nas the first representative of the United States, he bent all his\r\nenergies to the task of securing a commercial treaty which would provide\r\nfor unrestricted intercourse between the countries. It was an impossible\r\ntask. At every turn he encountered the hostility of the mercantile\r\nclasses, of whom Lord Sheffield was the most conspicuous representative.\r\n\"What have you to give us in exchange for this and that?\" \"What have you\r\nto give us as reciprocity for the benefit of going to our islands?\"\r\n\"What assurance can you give that the States will agree to a treaty?\"\r\nThese were the embarrassing questions which Adams had to encounter.\r\nBaffled by the cool indifference of the English Ministry, Adams wrote\r\nhome in despair that there was not the slightest prospect of relief for\r\nAmerican commerce unless the States would confer the power of passing\r\nnavigation laws upon Congress or themselves pass retaliatory acts\r\nagainst Great Britain.\r\n\r\nCongress had, indeed, already urged upon the States the necessity of\r\nyielding the power to enact navigation laws; but they had replied with\r\nsuch deliberation and with so many conditions that Congress was as\r\npowerless as ever. Meantime, each State struck blindly at the common\r\nenemy with little or no regard for its neighbors. \"The States are every\r\nday giving proofs,\" wrote Madison, \"that separate regulations are more\r\nlikely to set them by the ears than to attain the common object.\" When\r\nthe other New England States closed their ports to British shipping,\r\nConnecticut hastened to profit at their expense by throwing her ports\r\nwide open. New Jersey, with New York on one side and Pennsylvania on the\r\nother, was likened to a cask tapped at both ends. To find a historical\r\nparallel to the annals of this period, one must go back to the\r\nbickerings and jealousies of the states of ancient Greece.\r\n\r\nIn this dark picture, however, there are cheering rays of light. One by\r\none the States were redeeming their promises and ceding their western\r\nlands. It seemed as though the Confederation, hitherto a disembodied\r\nspirit, was about to tenant a body. By the year 1786 the United States\r\nwere in joint possession of the greater part of the vast region between\r\nthe Ohio, the Mississippi, and the Great Lakes--a domain of imperial\r\ndimensions. In anticipation of these cessions, Congress took under\r\nconsideration an ordinance reported by a committee of which Thomas\r\nJefferson was chairman. This ordinance contemplated the division of the\r\nland north of the thirty-first parallel into fourteen or sixteen States.\r\nThe settlers in these rectangular areas were not to form state\r\ngovernments at once, but for their temporary government were to borrow\r\nsuch constitutions as they thought best from the older States. When a\r\nState had twenty thousand inhabitants, it might frame a permanent\r\nconstitution and send a delegate to Congress. Admission to the Union was\r\nto be granted only when a State had as many free inhabitants as \"the\r\nleast numerous of the thirteen original States.\" Two features of\r\nJefferson's report do not appear in the Ordinance of 1784; the fantastic\r\nnames which Jefferson had selected and the fifth of the fundamental\r\nconditions which were to be a charter of compact between the old States\r\nand the new. It is perhaps no misfortune that the names Assenisipia,\r\nPolypotamia, Pelisipia, do not appear on the map; the article\r\nprohibiting slavery after the year 1800 might well have been retained.\r\n\r\n[Map: State-Making In the West 1783-1787]\r\n\r\nMore important than the Ordinance of 1784, which indeed is interesting\r\nchiefly because it was the forerunner of the final ordinance for the\r\nNorthwest Territory, is that adopted by Congress in the following year.\r\nThe so-called Land Ordinance of 1785 provided in general for the survey\r\nof a series of townships six miles square in the region immediately west\r\nof Pennsylvania, and for the further division of each township into\r\nthirty-six lots, or, as they were later styled, \"sections,\" one mile\r\nsquare. After satisfying the claims of the soldiers of the Continental\r\nArmy, Congress proposed to distribute these lands among the States, to\r\nbe sold at auction for a minimum price of one dollar an acre, reserving\r\ncertain sections in each township and one third of the mineral ore which\r\nmight be found. The sixteenth section in each township was to be set\r\naside for the support of education. Each purchaser was to receive with\r\nhis deed a definite description of his holding. Subsequent amendments to\r\nthe Land Ordinance made the terms of purchase somewhat easier. Instead\r\nof making an out-and-out purchase, prospective settlers might pay one\r\nthird in cash and receive a credit of three months for the balance of\r\nthe purchase price. Yet even with these inducements only seventy-three\r\nthousand acres had been sold to individuals down to 1788. The hazards of\r\nwestern settlement were still too great.\r\n\r\nDisappointed in the sales under the Land Ordinance, Congress was\r\npersuaded to consider the alternative course of selling large tracts to\r\ncompanies. The collapse of national credit left the public domain almost\r\nthe only available source of revenue. Early in 1787 the Ohio Company\r\noffered to purchase a tract of land between the Ohio and Muskingum\r\nRivers. The promoters of this company had been interested in an earlier\r\nproject of army officers for the founding of a military colony beyond\r\nthe Ohio. Organized at Boston in March, 1786, with a nominal capital of\r\none million dollars, it had within a year raised one fourth of that\r\namount and sent first General Samuel Parsons and then the Reverend\r\nManasseh Cutler to secure the desired grant from Congress. The labors of\r\nthis astute divine at the seat of government form an interesting chapter\r\nin the evolution of American legislative methods. By devices well known\r\nto the modern lobbyist he not only secured the grant of land, but also\r\ntook a hand in the shaping of a new ordinance for the Northwest\r\nTerritory. In order to secure the grant to his associates, he had to\r\nresort to log-rolling and agree to procure for a group of land\r\nspeculators an option to lands on the Scioto River. The grant to the\r\nOhio Company contained a million and a half acres; that to the Scioto\r\nCompany, five million acres. But while the one paid down half a million\r\ndollars, the other made no payment, expecting to dispose of their\r\n\"rights\" before the first payment was due. In the following year a third\r\ngrant of a million acres on the Great and Little Miami Rivers in Ohio\r\nwas made to John Cleve Symmes.\r\n\r\nFrom these sales Congress expected to realize over three and a half\r\nmillion dollars in public securities and at the same time to satisfy\r\nmilitary bounty warrants amounting to about eight hundred thousand\r\nacres. The actual amount realized was less than six hundred thousand\r\ndollars. The Scioto Company succeeded in disposing of rights to about\r\nthree million acres to a company organized in France, which in turn\r\nsold them to unsuspecting royalist emigrants. Neither company ever\r\nsecured a clear title to these lands, and Congress had eventually to\r\ncome to the relief of the unhappy French settlers with a donation of\r\ntwenty-four thousand acres. Unforeseen circumstances prevented either\r\nthe Ohio Company or Symmes from complying with the conditions of sale;\r\nand in both cases Congress consented to alter the terms of contract.\r\n\r\nOn July 13, 1787, Congress adopted the ordinance which it had long had\r\nunder consideration. The authorship of this \"charter of the west,\" after\r\nlong controversy, is still in dispute. Like all legislative measures it\r\nbears the mark of many hands. Certain features of Jefferson's ordinance\r\nreappear: the provision for temporary government and eventual statehood,\r\nand the fundamental articles of compact. Other provisions are stated in\r\na detailed fashion and suggest the probability that Congress had\r\ndefinite conditions to meet. The ordinance took final form while the\r\nReverend Manasseh Cutler was representing the Ohio Company in New York.\r\nPerhaps the most striking departure from the Ordinance of 1784 is the\r\nprovision for not less than three nor more than five States north of the\r\nOhio, where Jefferson planned for ten. Admission to the Union was to be\r\ngained only after the population had reached sixty thousand. Temporary\r\ngovernment was to consist of a governor, a secretary, and three judges\r\nappointed by Congress, who were to adopt such laws from other States as\r\nthey believed suited to local conditions. In each and every case\r\nCongress reserved the right to disallow these laws. Whenever a territory\r\nattained a population of five thousand, it was to pass to the second\r\ngrade of government, with a representative assembly, an appointive\r\ncouncil, and a delegate in Congress.\r\n\r\nSix articles of compact were also written into the ordinance, which were\r\nto remain forever unalterable except by the common consent of the\r\nparties thereto--\"the original States and the people and States in the\r\nsaid territory.\" Freedom of worship, the usual rights of person and\r\nproperty, and the obligation of private contracts were guaranteed.\r\nReligion, morality, and education were to be forever encouraged. Neither\r\nslavery nor involuntary servitude was to be permitted. In imposing these\r\nconditions Congress undoubtedly exceeded its powers under the Articles\r\nof Confederation, for that document nowhere confers upon Congress the\r\npower to make binding contracts, nor for that matter to legislate in any\r\nwise for the government of the common domain.\r\n\r\nThe Ohio Company hastened to colonize its broad acres on the Muskingum.\r\nBefore the end of the year 1787, the vanguard of the first colony was on\r\nthe march through Pennsylvania to the upper waters of the Ohio. There\r\nthey spent the winter constructing the craft which was to carry them to\r\ntheir destination. As soon as the ice broke up in the spring, they\r\nembarked on the Mayflower,--for so they had christened the craft,--and\r\nwithin five days set foot on the soil of Ohio. Other bands joined them,\r\nand by midsummer their rude huts and a blockhouse marked the site of\r\nwhat was to be the town of Marietta, the first New England settlement\r\nin the West. Across the Muskingum, at Fort Harmar, the new governor,\r\nGeneral St. Clair, had already taken up his official residence. Farther\r\ndown the river, Symmes planted a colony from New Jersey on the tract\r\nwhich he had purchased; and within the next few years settlements were\r\nmade in the adjoining district, which Virginia had reserved as bounty\r\nland for her soldiers. The vision of virgin lands in the Ohio country\r\nwas beginning to dawn upon the small farmer of the East. Emigration grew\r\napace. Between February and June, 1788, an observer noted not less than\r\nforty-five hundred settlers drifting past Fort Harmar in their\r\nflatboats, in search of new homes in the wilderness.\r\n\r\nWhile the colonization of the Northwest was going on under the eye of\r\nGovernor St. Clair, hardy pioneers were laying the foundations of a new\r\nsociety in the Southwest, without the protecting arm of the Government.\r\nBefore the war Daniel Boone had made his famous trace to \"the country of\r\nKentucke\" through the Cumberland Gap; and Robertson had led his colony\r\nfrom North Carolina to the upper waters of the Tennessee. Settlers had\r\nfollowed the long-rangers; and numerous communities sprang up by salt\r\nlick and water course. In all these settlements there was much local\r\nindependence. For a time the people on the Watauga had established a\r\ngovernment of their own. Upon the cession by North Carolina of her\r\nwestern lands, the settlers of eastern Tennessee took matters into their\r\nown hands and prepared to organize as a State. Congress had just adopted\r\nthe Ordinance of 1784, and one of Jefferson's prospective States\r\nincluded most of the land already appropriated by these pioneers. They\r\nnourished, too, long-standing grievances. They were taxed for the\r\nsupport of a government which treated them with contumely and ignored\r\ntheir administrative needs. The movement toward independence acquired\r\nsuch headway that not even the repeal of the act of cession by North\r\nCarolina could stay its course. With a confidence born of frontier\r\nconditions these \"modern Franks, the hardy mountain men,\" as a\r\ncontemporary called them, drafted a constitution, organized a\r\ngovernment, and appealed to Congress for recognition as a State of the\r\nConfederation. For three years the State of Franklin, as it was\r\nofficially christened, under the able leadership of Governor John\r\nSovier, refused to recognize the authority of North Carolina, even to\r\nthe point of resisting the militia by arms. But Congress turned a deaf\r\near to the petitions of the insurgents; and in the year 1788, diplomacy\r\nsucceeding where coercion had failed, the people of Franklin returned to\r\ntheir first allegiance.\r\n\r\nMuch the same centrifugal forces were at work in northwestern Virginia\r\nand western Pennsylvania, a region which felt its isolation keenly.\r\n\"Separated by a vast, extensive and almost impassible Tract of\r\nMountains, by Nature itself formed and pointed out as a Boundary between\r\nthis Country and those below it,\" the settlers of this trans-Alleghany\r\nregion besought Congress to recognize them as a \"sister colony and\r\nfourteenth province of the American Confederacy.\"\r\n\r\nMore menacing to the integrity of Virginia was a movement for\r\nindependent statehood among the people of Kentucky. Rivers were the\r\nhighways of their commerce and the current of all bore their flatboats\r\naway from the parent State. New Orleans was their inevitable _entrepot_.\r\nThe forces of nature seemed to conspire to throw these western\r\nsettlements into the hands of Spain. Washington was deeply impressed by\r\nthe necessity of connecting the headwaters of the James and the Potomac\r\nwith the tributaries of the Ohio, if the trade and allegiance of the\r\npeople of Kentucky were to be secured to Virginia and to the Union. \"The\r\nwestern States,\" he wrote to Governor Harrison of Virginia, \"stand as it\r\nwere upon a pivot. The touch of a feather would turn them any way.\" The\r\nsituation in Kentucky became more acute as intimations reached the\r\npeople that John Jay was proposing to renounce the free navigation of\r\nthe Mississippi.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1785, Don Diego de Gardoqui, the first accredited\r\nMinister from Spain, arrived in the United States to settle all\r\noutstanding differences between the two countries. Congress appointed\r\nJohn Jay as its diplomatic agent and instructed him to hold insistently\r\nto the thirty-first parallel as the southern boundary of the States and\r\nto the free navigation of the Mississippi. The prospect of agreement was\r\nvery slight. The American claims were based solely on the Treaty of 1783\r\nwhich the King of Spain was determined not to recognize. Negotiations\r\ndragged on for months. Reporting to Congress in August, 1786, Jay\r\nadvised the abandonment of the claim of free navigation of the\r\nMississippi for the sake of securing an advantageous commercial treaty\r\nwith Spain. The delegates from Northern States were ready to barter away\r\nthe Southwest; but the Southern delegates succeeded in postponing action\r\nuntil the impotent Confederation gave way to a more perfect union.\r\n\r\nAt the Court of St. James, John Adams was having no better luck in\r\npressing the rights of the moribund Confederation. Notwithstanding the\r\nexplicit terms of the Treaty of 1783, British garrisons still held\r\nstrategic posts along the Great Lakes, exercising a strong influence\r\nupon the Indians and guarding the interests of British fur traders. Such\r\na situation would have been intolerable to a self-respecting nation.\r\nSmothering his pride, Adams mustered all the diplomacy which his nature\r\npermitted and sought an explanation of this extraordinary conduct from\r\nthe ministers. He was finally told that he need not expect Great Britain\r\nto relinquish the Western posts so long as the States continued to put\r\nobstacles in the way of the collection of British debts.\r\n\r\nA general reluctance to meet financial obligations was a deplorable\r\naspect of the depression to which American society had succumbed. In all\r\nthe States there was a more or less numerous class of debtors who were\r\nconvinced that the Government could help them out of all their\r\ndistresses. As the cause of all their woes was the scarcity of money,\r\nwhy, let the Government manufacture money and so put an end to the\r\nstringency. What Madison called \"the general rage for paper money\"\r\nseized upon Rhode Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, the Carolinas, and\r\nGeorgia. Coupled with paper-money acts were others designed to alleviate\r\nthe distress of the unfortunate. Stay laws of one sort or another were\r\ndevised to keep the wolf, in the guise of the sheriff, from the door.\r\nLegal-tender acts made cattle and produce equivalent to money when\r\noffered in payment of debts. Nor was this legislation inspired\r\naltogether by dishonest intent. Many believed with Luther Martin, of\r\nMaryland, that there were times of great public distress and extreme\r\nscarcity of specie when it was the duty of the Government to pass stay\r\nlaws and legal-tender acts, \"to prevent the wealthy creditor and the\r\nmoneyed man from totally destroying the poor, though even industrious,\r\ndebtor.\"\r\n\r\nNo State suffered more from the paper-money aberration than Rhode\r\nIsland. Under pressure from the radical elements the legislature passed\r\nan act for the emission of bills of credit which were to be issued to\r\nany freeholder who would offer as security real estate of any sort to\r\ndouble the amount of the loan. \"Many from all parts of the State made\r\nhaste to avail themselves of their good fortune, and mortgaged fields\r\nstrewn thick with stones and covered with cedars and stunted pines for\r\nsums such as could not have been obtained for the richest pastures.\" But\r\nwhen they sought their creditors, not a merchant nor a shop-keeper could\r\nbe found. Nobody fished to have a just debt discharged in such currency.\r\nNot to be thwarted in their purpose, the radicals then enacted a law\r\nwhich threatened with a summary trial and a heavy fine any one who\r\nrefused to accept paper money in payment of debt.\r\n\r\nUnder this Force Act, one John Weeden, a butcher, was brought to trial\r\nfor refusing to receive the paper offered by a customer in payment for\r\nmeat. To the discomfiture of the legislature the court refused to\r\nenforce the law in this instance, on the ground that the statute was\r\ncontrary to the constitution of Rhode Island; and when summoned before\r\nthe legislature to answer for their defiance, the judges boldly stood\r\ntheir ground. The case of _Trevett_ v. _Weeden_ was not without its\r\nlesson to those who were casting about for ways and means to defend\r\nproperty from the assaults of popular majorities. In Virginia, too, the\r\nhighest state court, in the case of _Commonwealth_ v. _Caton_, boldly\r\nasserted the right of the judiciary to declare void such acts of the\r\nlegislature as were repugnant to the constitution.\r\n\r\nMeantime the debtor and creditor classes in Massachusetts were locked in\r\na struggle which menaced the peace of the country. Here as elsewhere\r\nhard times had forced the small farmers of the interior counties to the\r\nwall. No doubt their difficulties were caused in part by their own\r\nimprovidence, but they were increased by the prevailing scarcity of\r\nmoney. So dire was the want of a medium of exchange that many\r\ncommunities resorted to barter. The editor of a Worcester paper\r\nadvertised that he would accept Indian corn, rye, wheat, wood, or\r\nflaxseed, in payment of debts owed to him, up to the amount of twenty\r\nshillings. It seemed to the ignorant farmer that his creditors were\r\ntaking an unfair advantage of circumstances in demanding currency to\r\nsettle debts which had been contracted when money was abundant. The\r\nlaw, however, favored the creditor. The jails were filled to overflowing\r\nwith men imprisoned for debt; the courts were overwhelmed with actions.\r\nIn Worcester County, with a population of less than fifty thousand\r\npeople, there were in 1784 two thousand cases on the docket of the\r\nInferior Court of Common Pleas. In this age of litigation only one class\r\nappeared to thrive--the lawyers. The anger of the poor debtors, inflamed\r\nby attachments and foreclosures, vented itself upon the ostensible cause\r\nof their misfortunes. The excessive costs of courts and the immoderate\r\nfees of lawyers are grievances which bulk large in every indictment\r\ndrawn by town meeting or county convention. Young John Quincy Adams,\r\nthen a senior in Harvard College, was so affected by the odium which had\r\nfallen upon the practice of law that he was almost ready to abandon the\r\ncareer which he had chosen.\r\n\r\nThe adjournment of the General Court in July, 1786, without authorizing\r\nan issue of paper money or passing a legal-tender act or fixing the fees\r\nof lawyers and the costs of courts, contributed to the unrest which was\r\nnow assuming a threatening aspect. During August and September riotous\r\nmobs prevented the courts from sitting at Northampton, Worcester, Great\r\nBarrington, and Concord. Alarmed by these disorders Governor Bowdoin\r\nconvened the legislature in special session and summoned the militia to\r\nthe protection of the capital. While the legislature was devising ways\r\nand means of allaying the public excitement, another demonstration\r\noccurred at Worcester which resulted in the dispersion of the Court of\r\nGeneral Sessions by a force of armed men. From Worcester the disorders\r\nspread into adjoining counties; and something like a concerted movement\r\nupon Boston and Cambridge seemed to be preparing. The prompt action of\r\nthe state authorities however, balked the plans of the insurgents. The\r\nmain body of insurgents under Shays scattered; but a month later they\r\nrallied around Springfield to prevent the holding of court. Governor\r\nBowdoin then dispatched troops, four thousand strong, under the command\r\nof General Lincoln, to the assistance and protection of the civil\r\nauthorities. A civil war seemed imminent. Shays had planned an attack\r\nupon the national arsenal at Springfield, but he could not bring his\r\nrustics to act together. Before the determined resistance of the local\r\nmilitia his undisciplined troops broke and fled. The arrival of the\r\nstate militia under Lincoln completed the demoralization of Shays' army.\r\nRetreating through the hilly country of Hampshire, they wore finally\r\novertaken and routed at Petersham. Some of the insurgents went to their\r\nhomes, completely humbled and subdued; others fled across the border to\r\nawait better times; and still others, unrepentant and unsubdued,\r\ncontinued to harass the countryside. It was not until the following\r\nSeptember that Governor Bowdoin ventured to disband the militia.\r\n\r\nTo these disturbances in Massachusetts, Congress had not remained\r\nindifferent. Aside from the direct interest that all members were bound\r\nto take in a rebellion which seemed to threaten the very foundations of\r\na sister State and which might easily recur in their own, Congress was\r\nconcerned for the fate of the national arsenal at Springfield. But no\r\nforces were available for the protection of the property of the\r\nConfederation. The few hundred men who comprised the army were scattered\r\nin garrisons along the western frontier. Acting as intermediary between\r\nCongress and Governor Bowdoin, General Knox as Secretary of War made\r\nwhat provision he could for the defense of the arsenal by local militia;\r\nbut these measures were confessedly inadequate. Upon his report Congress\r\nwas finally moved to increase the army, ostensibly for the protection of\r\nthe frontier, where in truth Indian hostilities required the presence of\r\nadditional troops. As these forces would be raised chiefly in New\r\nEngland, they could be employed first to protect Springfield. Any open\r\navowal of this plan was avoided, however, lest the insurgents should\r\ntake alarm and immediately attack the arsenal. But these plans were\r\nwrecked on the reef of financial bankruptcy. Congress could only\r\nsupplicate the States for money and borrow what it might on its\r\nexpectations. Recruiting went on so slowly that the rebellion was\r\npractically over when two companies of artillery, numbering\r\nseventy-three men each, which had been raised in Massachusetts, were\r\nfinally marched to Springfield. All the other recruits were dismissed.\r\nThe inefficiency of Congress and its want of moral influence were\r\nself-confessed.\r\n\r\nIn his famous circular letter of 1783, Washington had spoken of the\r\ntimes as a period of \"political probation.\" The moment had come for the\r\nUnited States to determine, said he, \"whether they will be respectable\r\nand prosperous, or contemptible and miserable, as a nation.\" Three years\r\nhad now passed and the period of probation seemed to have ended in the\r\nruin of national hopes. The events of the years 1786 made a profound\r\nimpression upon the minds of all responsible and conservative men. In\r\nundisguised alarm, Washington wrote: \"There are combustibles in every\r\nState which a spark might set fire to.... I feel ... infinitely more\r\nthan I can express to you, for the disorders which have arisen in these\r\nStates. Good God! Who, besides a Tory, could have foreseen, or a Briton,\r\npredicted them?\" Rightly or wrongly, men of the upper classes believed\r\nthat the foundations of society were threatened and that the State\r\nGovernments would fall a prey to the radical and unpropertied elements,\r\nunless a stronger Federal Government were created. \"With this idea, they\r\nare thinking, very seriously,\" wrote an interested observer at the seat\r\nof Federal Government in New York, \"in what manner to effect the most\r\neasy and natural change of the present form of the Federal Government to\r\none more energetic, that will, at the same time, create respect, and\r\nsecure properly life, liberty, and property. It is, therefore, not\r\nuncommon to hear the principles of government stated in common\r\nconversation. Emperors, kings, stadtholders, governors-general, with a\r\nsenate or house of lords, and house of commons, are frequently the\r\ntopics of conversation.\" There were those who frankly advocated a\r\nmonarchical government as the only way of escape from the ills under\r\nwhich American society was laboring. There is reason to believe that a\r\nproject was on foot to invite Prince Henry of Prussia to become the head\r\nof a new consolidated government. The influence of the Order of the\r\nCincinnati was much feared by friends of republican institutions.\r\nIndividually members of the order did not hesitate to express their\r\nimpatience with popular government. What was to come out of this\r\npolitical chaos, no man could tell.\r\n\r\n\r\n     BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\r\n\r\n     The two most extensive histories dealing with the period of the\r\n     Confederation are George Bancroft's _History of the Formation of\r\n     the Constitution of the United States of America_ (2 vols., 1882)\r\n     and G. T. Curtis's _History of the Origin, Formation, and Adoption\r\n     of the Constitution of the United States_ (2 vols., 1854). In the\r\n     fourth volume of Hildreth's _History of the United States_ (6\r\n     vols., 1849-52), a concise but rather dry account of the\r\n     Confederation may be found. More entertaining is John Fiske's _The\r\n     Critical Period of American History, 1783-1789_ (1888). Valuable\r\n     information bearing on the social as well as the political history\r\n     of the times is contained in the first volume of J. B. McMaster's\r\n     _History of the People of the United States from the Revolution to\r\n     the Civil War_ (7 vols., 1883-1913). More recent histories of the\r\n     period are A. C. McLaughlin's _The Confederation and the\r\n     Constitution, 1783-1789_ (in _The American Nation_, vol. 10,\r\n     1905), and Edward Channing's _History of the United States_, vol.\r\n     III (3 vols., 1905- ). A vigorous narrative of the exploits of the\r\n     pioneers beyond the Alleghanies has been written by Theodore\r\n     Roosevelt, _Winning of the West_ (4 vols., 1889-96). A more\r\n     restrained account of the beginnings of Western settlement is B.\r\n     A. Hinsdale's _The Old Northwest, the Beginnings of our Colonial\r\n     System_ (1899).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE MAKING OF THE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the manifold differences between State and State in the\r\nConfederation, there were everywhere groups of men who confronted much\r\nthe same economic conditions. Between the farmer who tilled his sterile\r\nhillside acres in the interior of New England and the cultivator of the\r\nricher soil of the Piedmont in Virginia and the Carolinas, a greater\r\nidentity of economic interests existed than the casual observer would\r\nhave suspected. The feeling of hostility which circumstances bred in the\r\nfollowers of Daniel Shays toward the merchants of Boston was akin to\r\nthat which the farmers of middle and western Pennsylvania harbored\r\ntoward the aristocratic and wealthy classes of Philadelphia and the\r\neastern counties. A similar antagonism appears between the yeomen of the\r\nuplands and the planters of the tidewater farther to the south,\r\naccentuated, no doubt, by religious and racial differences. The\r\nScotch-Irish or German dissenter, who was treated with contempt as a\r\nforeigner and forced to support a church established by a State\r\nGovernment which discriminated against numbers and in favor of property,\r\nwas not likely to feel kindly toward the tidewater aristocracy. Bad\r\ncrops spelled disaster for these farmers, for they had incurred debt to\r\npurchase their lands and had borrowed capital to work them. In hard\r\ntimes they were the first to suffer, for whether money was scarce or\r\nplentiful, the tax-collector and the money-lender knocked inexorably at\r\ntheir doors. Bad roads kept them isolated and want of intercourse bred\r\nmuch ignorance and prejudice in even honest men. Were the recorded\r\ngrievances of these inland groups brought together, they would show a\r\nsurprising agreement.\r\n\r\nSet over against this interior population with predominant agrarian\r\ninterests were those classes, urban for the most part, whose income was\r\nderived from personal rather than real property. Even at this time a\r\ncapitalist class of no mean proportions existed. No inconsiderable part\r\nof this personalty was invested in shipping and manufacturing. A part,\r\nnot easily determined, was tied up in Western lands, which appealed\r\nstrongly to the speculative instincts of the American. The amount of\r\nmoney at interest was also considerable in States like Massachusetts. As\r\ncreditors of the debt-burdened farmers these classes were everywhere on\r\nthe defensive. To this group should be added the holders of public\r\nsecurities, both state and continental, who could not have remained\r\nuninterested witnesses of the demise of the Confederation.\r\n\r\nThe logic of events was drawing these holders of personal property\r\ntogether. Capitalists with idle money found the avenues to profitable\r\ninvestment closed by the inability of Congress to offer protection to\r\neither manufacturing or shipping; creditors with money at interest\r\nwitnessed with alarm the inability or unwillingness of state\r\nlegislatures to resist attacks upon private contracts and public\r\ncredit; holders of public securities shared the general contempt for a\r\nGovernment, which, so far from providing for the ultimate redemption of\r\nits obligations, could not even pay interest on its debts; speculators\r\nin lands despaired of a rise in values so long as the Government could\r\nnot defend its borders and protect its frontier population. The desire\r\nof all these classes, from Boston to Charleston, was for a Government\r\nwhich would govern.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances the idea of a special convention to revise the\r\nArticles of Confederation grew in favor. Some of the States, notably\r\nDelaware, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, had employed constituent\r\nconventions to draft new frames of government. The legislature of New\r\nYork had in 1782 proposed a convention to revise the Articles of\r\nConfederation. At the suggestion of Governor Bowdoin, the General Court\r\nof Massachusetts had resolved in 1785 in favor of such a convention; but\r\nthe delegates in Congress, for reasons best known to themselves, had\r\nrefused to present the resolution. In any case Congress could hardly be\r\nexpected to take the initiative.\r\n\r\nFor many years Virginia and Maryland had been at loggerheads over the\r\nnavigation of the Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay. In 1784\r\ncommissioners from both States met at Alexandria, and subsequently at\r\nWashington's country-seat, at Mount Vernon, to make a last effort to\r\nadjudicate their differences. It speedily appeared that the question of\r\ncommercial regulations was one that concerned also their neighbors to\r\nthe north. Maryland proposed that Pennsylvania and Delaware should be\r\ninvited to a further conference. The assembly of Virginia went still\r\nfurther and appointed delegates to meet with delegates from other States\r\n\"to take into consideration the trade of the United States\" and \"to\r\nconsider how far a uniform system in their commercial regulations may be\r\nnecessary to their common interest and their permanent harmony.\"\r\nAnnapolis was selected as the place of meeting.\r\n\r\nThe response of the States to this call was disappointing. Only five\r\nStates sent delegates. Positive action on trade relations was, of\r\ncourse, out of the question. But Alexander Hamilton, who attended as a\r\ndelegate from New York, drafted a report which went far to redeem the\r\nsituation. Addressed to the legislatures of the States represented at\r\nAnnapolis, it called attention to the critical state of the Union and\r\nthe need of a convention of delegates with wider powers from all the\r\nStates; and in conclusion, it named Philadelphia and the second Monday\r\nin May, 1787, as a suitable place and time for such a convention. \"From\r\nmotives of respect\" a copy of this report was sent to Congress.\r\n\r\nWith its wonted indecision, Congress dallied with this bold proposal\r\nuntil late in the following February. Meantime, Virginia and other\r\nStates appointed delegates to the convention which Congress had not yet\r\nsanctioned. When Congress finally issued the summons, it made no\r\nreference to the Annapolis Convention, though it took over bodily the\r\nrecommendations of that body. The sole and express purpose of the\r\nconvention was declared to be the revision of the Articles of\r\nConfederation.\r\n\r\nThe delegates to the Philadelphia Convention were to be \"appointed by\r\nthe States.\" As a matter of course, the choice devolved upon the\r\nlegislature in every instance. To what extent the active economic\r\ninterests directed and controlled the selection is a mere matter of\r\nspeculation. Certain it is that the members of the convention belonged\r\nto the governing class in their respective communities. Almost to a man\r\nthey had held important public positions. To a surprising extent they\r\ncame from the commercial sections of their States. \"Not one member\r\nrepresented in his immediate personal economic interests the small\r\nfarming or mechanic classes.\" A large majority were \"directly and\r\npersonally interested in the outcome of their labors through their\r\nownership of property, real or personal.\" Many were holders of public\r\nsecurities and profited by the later funding operations of the new\r\nGovernment; some had invested in Western lands; others had capital\r\ninvested in manufacturing, shipping, and slaves. Thus circumstanced,\r\nthey had no mind to try doubtful experiments in government.\r\n\r\nAmong the first of the delegates to reach Philadelphia was James\r\nMadison. Other members of the Virginia delegation soon joined him, and\r\non the 13th of May, Washington made what was really a triumphant entry\r\ninto the city. When the 14th dawned only a few delegates had arrived.\r\nInclement weather and bad roads detained many, no doubt; but a general\r\ndilatoriness in heeding the summons was accountable for the tardiness\r\nof others. Until a majority of States were represented, the delegates\r\ncould only adjourn from day to day. That the gentlemen from Virginia put\r\nthis time to good use appears from the plan which they drew up as a\r\ntentative program and which Randolph presented to the convention.\r\nIndeed, there is little doubt that much unrecorded progress was made\r\nthroughout the convention by informal conferences among the leaders.\r\n\r\nIt was not until Friday, May 25, that seven States were represented and\r\na preliminary organization could be effected. Washington was the\r\nunanimous choice for president, though tradition has it that Franklin\r\nwas the first choice of many delegates. Altogether, though not at any\r\none time, there were fifty-five delegates in attendance from twelve\r\nStates. Rhode Island was never represented. The average attendance was\r\nhardly more than thirty. It was possible, therefore, to adopt simple\r\nrules of procedure and to permit full discussion. The credentials of the\r\ndelegates gave them, with a single exception, free hand in revising the\r\nArticles of Confederation. Delaware alone forbade its representatives to\r\nmake any alterations which should deprive the State of its equal vote in\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nAs the doors closed on this notable body in the chamber over\r\nIndependence Hall in the State House, profound secrecy enveloped its\r\nproceedings. Not until the publication of the journal by act of Congress\r\nin 1819 were the actual proceedings of the convention divulged; and many\r\nmore years passed before Madison's notes on the debates were given to\r\nthe curious public. The earth scattered on the pavement to silence the\r\nrattling of wheels and the sentries stationed at the doors to warn\r\nintruders gave added emphasis to the importance of this gathering.\r\n\r\nThe task before the convention was one of immense difficulty. The most\r\ngeneral criticism of the Confederation was that expressed in the vague\r\nphrase, \"lack of power\"; but the defect could not be overcome merely by\r\ngiving new powers to Congress. Any such increase of authority involved a\r\ndelicate readjustment of the relations of the States to each other and\r\nto the central Government. Before the convention had been in session a\r\nfortnight, a line of cleavage among the delegates appeared. To the most\r\nobtuse mind the resolutions presented as the Virginia plan seemed to\r\nreach far beyond any mere revision of the Articles of Confederation.\r\nRandolph frankly admitted the scope of his resolutions by urging that a\r\nunion of the States merely federal would not suffice. The convention so\r\nfar yielded to the general drift as to adopt, in committee of the whole,\r\nthe resolution \"that a national government ought to be established\r\nconsisting of a supreme Legislative, Executive, and Judiciary.\"\r\n\r\nAs the group of nationally minded delegates, led by Madison and Wilson,\r\nof Pennsylvania, seized this initial advantage and secured the\r\nacceptance, step by step, of the main features of a national government,\r\nthe delegates from the smaller States drew together in alarmed\r\nopposition. It was in their behalf that Paterson, of New Jersey,\r\npresented his resolutions. In contrast to the Virginia plan, this held\r\nout only the prospect of an improved Confederation. Additional powers\r\nwere to be given to Congress and there was to be an executive and a\r\nsupreme judiciary; but the basal principle of the Confederation--the\r\nequality of the States--was left untouched. Given the alternative\r\nbetween the New Jersey plan and the Virginia plan as amended, seven\r\nStates voted for the latter. Only New York, New Jersey, and Delaware\r\npreferred the former. The vote of Maryland was divided. The convention\r\nthen returned to the detailed consideration of the amended Virginia\r\nplan. The large-State men were now disposed to make some concessions.\r\nThe word \"national\" was dropped from all the resolutions; and minor\r\nchanges were made in the interest of harmony. But on the fundamental\r\nquestion of what was termed \"proportional representation,\"--that is,\r\nrepresentation of the States in proportion to numbers in the national\r\nlegislature,--no agreement seemed possible. More than once the\r\nconvention was on the point of adjourning _sine die_. Even the usually\r\nplacid Franklin suggested that \"prayers imploring the assistance of\r\nHeaven ... be held in this Assembly every morning.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of the opposition of the smaller States, the convention finally\r\nvoted that the rule of suffrage in the first branch of the legislature\r\nought not to be according to that established by the Articles of\r\nConfederation. Debate then turned on the manner of constituting the\r\nupper chamber. On July 2, a vote was taken on the proposal of the\r\nConnecticut delegation that each State should have an equal vote in the\r\nupper house. The result was a tie, five States against five, with the\r\nvote of one State divided. The deadlock seemed complete.\r\n\r\nHoping that a compromise might even yet be effected, General Pinckney\r\nproposed a committee of one from each State to consider the whole\r\nmatter. Opposition was made, but the convention indorsed the proposal\r\nand chose the members of the committee by ballot. The selection was\r\nobviously favorable to the small-State party, for the committee\r\nabandoned the idea of proportional representation in the second chamber.\r\nOn July 5, it recommended that in the first branch of the legislature\r\nthere should be one representative for every forty thousand inhabitants\r\nin each State, counting three fifths of the slaves, and that in the\r\nsecond chamber the States should have an equal vote. The first\r\nproposition underwent further changes at the hands of a special\r\ncommittee, but the principle of representation was accepted. On July 16,\r\nthe first proposition as amended and the second proposition without\r\nchange were adopted by a vote of five States to four, with the vote of\r\none State divided. Very properly historians have termed this the great\r\ncompromise of the Constitution, for without it the further work of the\r\nconvention would have been impossible. In agreeing that three fifths of\r\nthe slaves should be counted in apportioning representation, the\r\nconvention made no innovation, but simply took over the federal ratio\r\nwhich Congress had recommended in 1783 as the basis for future\r\napportionment of requisitions among the States. On this point there was\r\nno great difference of opinion in the convention.\r\n\r\nIt would be a mistake, however, to suppose that with this obstacle to\r\nunion removed, the Constitution speedily took form. On the contrary,\r\nevery proposal bristled with controversial points. The Northern\r\ncommercial States demanded insistently that Congress should be given\r\npower to regulate commerce. It was, indeed, the desire of the commercial\r\nclasses in all the States that Congress should be given power to pass\r\nretaliatory acts against Great Britain, but the planters of the\r\nCarolinas and Georgia feared--not without reason--that the power to\r\nregulate commerce might be used to interfere with the importation of\r\nslaves. Here, too, the spirit of compromise prevailed. The power was\r\ngranted, but the importation of such persons as the States thought\r\nproper to admit was not to be prohibited before the year 1808.\r\n\r\nFrom first to last, divergent views were held as to the constitution of\r\nthe chief executive office. After the initial question, whether the\r\noffice should be single or plural, was decided, the manner of election\r\nremained to be considered. The early proposal to make the President\r\nelective by the national legislature was dropped as the office assumed\r\ngreater importance in the general scheme. If the independence of the\r\nlegislature was to be maintained, some form of indirect popular choice\r\nwas favored. But if the people were to elect, the larger States would\r\nhave a decided advantage. Here was the old question in another form. The\r\nelectoral scheme finally adopted was essentially a compromise. In most\r\ninstances--Mason, of Virginia, said nineteen out of twenty times--it was\r\nbelieved that the electors would so scatter their votes that no\r\ncandidate would have a majority; consequently the Senate would make a\r\nchoice from among the five candidates having the highest votes. By this\r\narrangement the large States would in effect nominate and the small\r\nStates elect the President. But because the Senate had already been\r\ngiven extensive powers, the convention transferred the final election to\r\nthe House, with the provision that the vote there should be by States.\r\nThe eventual election of a Vice-President was left to the Senate,\r\nwhenever the electoral college failed to make a choice.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time the convention resorted to committees to facilitate\r\nits work. Most important services were rendered by the committee of\r\ndetail, which early in August put into orderly and connected form the\r\nconclusions which the convention had reached. It was the committee on\r\nunfinished business which suggested the method finally adopted of\r\nelecting the President. In its final form and phrasing the Constitution\r\nis the work of Gouverneur Morris, who prepared the report of the\r\ncommittee of style.\r\n\r\nCitizens of Philadelphia who took up their copies of the _Pennsylvania\r\nAdvertiser_ on Tuesday, September 17, found to their surprise that the\r\ncolumns were completely filled with the new Constitution. This was their\r\nfirst intimation of what the convention had really done. Rumor had\r\nstalked abroad that the convention was rent by dissensions; but the\r\nenvious reader saw at the end of his paper the words, \"Done in\r\nconvention by the unanimous consent of the States ... in witness whereof\r\nwe have hereunto subscribed our names.\" Done by unanimous consent of\r\nthe delegates the Constitution was not, for not all the delegates who\r\nwere present on the last day would affix their signatures. It was\r\nGouverneur Morris who suggested the phrase which gave a specious\r\nunanimity to the work of the convention.\r\n\r\nThe thoughtful reader of the Constitution must have been impressed by\r\nthe new features which caught his eye. In place of the old inefficient\r\nand powerless Congress, he observed a well-organized national\r\nlegislature, an independent executive, and a federal judiciary of ample\r\njurisdiction. Further scrutiny must have apprised him that the new\r\nGovernment would operate directly upon individuals, thus remedying a\r\nvital defect in the Confederation. The powers given to Congress may well\r\nhave set at rest the minds of anxious public creditors. With the power\r\nto lay and collect taxes, to raise and support a military and naval\r\nestablishment, and to regulate commerce, Congress had ample means to pay\r\nthe public debt, to enforce its claims, and to offer protection to trade\r\nand industry. Not less significant to property-owners were the brief\r\nclauses in the new Constitution which sharply forbade States to emit\r\nbills of credit, to make anything but gold and silver legal tender in\r\npayment of debts, and to make laws impairing the obligation of\r\ncontracts.\r\n\r\n[Map: Distribution of Votes in Ratification of the Constitution\r\nThe New England States (Based on the map of Dr. O. G. Libby)]\r\n\r\nBut what guaranty was there that States would observe these\r\nprohibitions? The power to coerce a State was nowhere conferred. The\r\nmilitia, to be sure, could be called out to execute the laws; and the\r\nUnited States guaranteed to every State a republican form of government\r\nand promised protection against domestic violence. Congress could deal\r\nsurely and effectively with any future Shays if it were invited to do\r\nso. But what if a State passed a law violating the obligation of\r\ncontracts? The answer is contained in the clause which reads: \"This\r\nConstitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in\r\nPursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under\r\nthe Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the\r\nLand; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in\r\nthe Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\"\r\nThis and the correlative clause which extended the judicial power to all\r\ncases arising under the Constitution, the laws and the treaties of the\r\nUnited States, may be called the keystone of the whole constitutional\r\nstructure. \"For the first time in history, courts are called upon by the\r\nsimple processes of administering justice, in cases where private right\r\nor personal injury is involved, to uphold the structure of the body\r\npolitic.\" And there were those in the convention who believed that the\r\nprinciple of judicial control included the power of passing upon the\r\nconstitutionality of laws enacted by Congress.\r\n\r\nIt was still within the power of the old Congress to expedite or block\r\nthe ratification of the new Constitution. The document which the\r\nPhiladelphia Convention presented was technically only a revision of the\r\nArticles of Confederation, which might be altered only with the consent\r\nof the legislatures of all thirteen States; but the last article of this\r\nnew instrument provided that when ratified by conventions (not\r\nlegislatures) in nine States, it should go into effect among the States\r\nso acting. In effect, Congress was asked to sanction a secession of nine\r\nStates from the old Union which had been declared perpetual. Making a\r\nvirtue of necessity, Congress finally yielded and passed the\r\nConstitution on to the States.\r\n\r\n[Map: Distribution of Votes in Ratification of the Constitution\r\nThe Middle States (Based on the map of O. G. Libby)]\r\n\r\nSince the party struggles of Whigs and Tories no campaign of continental\r\nproportions had ever been seen like that which ensued between the\r\nfriends and foes of the new Constitution. By their forehandedness and\r\ntheir clear perception of what they must do, the Federalists, as the\r\nproponents of better government styled themselves, had a slight tactical\r\nadvantage. The Anti-Federalists resented the assumption of the name by\r\ntheir opponents. They were the true friends of federal government, while\r\nthe friends of the new Constitution aimed to set up a consolidated\r\ngovernment. The press teemed with letters and essays, allegories and\r\nsatires, squibs and pasquinades, expostulating, warning, ridiculing. The\r\npublic was invited to heed the admonitions of Cato, Cassius, and many\r\nanother worthy Roman.\r\n\r\nAlthough much the same arguments, sober or satirical, were used\r\neverywhere, the campaign had to be fought out in the several States,\r\neach with its own peculiar social, economic, and political conditions.\r\nIn Massachusetts the eastern counties, with their dominant commercial\r\nand mercantile interests, favored the Constitution, while the interior\r\nagricultural section, which had fought the battles of the Revolution and\r\nrecruited the ranks of Shays' army, opposed it. The interior counties of\r\nNew York containing the farming population were Anti-Federal, while the\r\ncity and county of New York with its environs--the commercial\r\nsection--were Federalist. In Pennsylvania, those who had opposed the\r\ndomination of the Scotch-Irish and German radicals in the State\r\nGovernment now united in advocacy of the new Constitution. Here as\r\nelsewhere the Federal area corresponded closely to the counties where\r\ncommercial and mercantile interests were most in evidence. In Virginia,\r\nthe old-time social and economic antagonism between east and west,\r\nbetween the planters and merchants of the tidewater and the small\r\nfarmers of the interior, reappeared. Much the same alignment is found in\r\nthe Carolinas. Beyond the Alleghanies, the people were a unit in\r\nopposing the Constitution.\r\n\r\nDetailed studies of the geographical distribution of votes in the state\r\nconventions, and recent investigations in the archives of the Treasury\r\nDepartment, sustain the conclusion to which the historian is driven by\r\nthe testimony of contemporaries, that the fundamental opposition between\r\nthe advocates and opponents of the Constitution was based on\r\ndistinctions of wealth. On his first view of the Constitution young John\r\nQuincy Adams wrote in his diary: \"It is calculated to increase the\r\ninfluence, and power, and wealth of those who have any already.\" A\r\nwriter in the _Boston Gazette_ declared that the supporters of the\r\nConstitution consisted generally of the noble Order of Cincinnatus,\r\nholders of public securities, bankers, and lawyers: \"these with their\r\ntrain of dependents form the Aristocratick combination.\" Over against\r\nthis should be put the remark of Alexander Hamilton: that the new\r\nConstitution encountered the \"opposition of all men much in debt, who\r\nwill not wish to see a government established, one object of which is to\r\nrestrain the means of cheating creditors.\" According to John Adams, the\r\nConstitution was \"the work of the commercial people in the seaport\r\ntowns, of the planters of the slaveholding states, of the officers of\r\nthe Revolutionary army, and the property-holders everywhere.\"\r\n\r\nFrom November to the following July the campaign continued. Delaware,\r\nNew Jersey, and Georgia ratified the Constitution unanimously;\r\nConnecticut by a majority of three to one; and Pennsylvania, by a\r\nmajority of two to one. But there is reason to believe that these\r\nmajorities in the ratifying conventions did not reflect public opinion\r\naccurately. Massachusetts, Maryland, and South Carolina followed\r\nhesitatingly, each proposing amendments to the Constitution. Toward the\r\nend of June the ninth State, New Hampshire, threw in her lot with the\r\nmajority; and on the heels of this news came the intelligence that the\r\nOld Dominion had also ratified. The Constitution was now the law of the\r\nland. In the stanch Federal city of Philadelphia, the Fourth of July was\r\ncelebrated with great rejoicing, for in the parlance of the time the\r\nsloop Anarchy was ashore on Union Rock, the old scow Confederation had\r\nput to sea, and the good ship Federal Constitution had come into port\r\nbringing a cargo of Public Credit and Prosperity.\r\n\r\n[Map: Distribution of Votes in Ratification of the Constitution\r\nThe Southern States, 1787-1790 (Based on the map by Dr. O. G. Libby)]\r\n\r\nBut until New York ratified the Constitution this rejoicing was\r\npremature. Geographically New York was a pivotal State. A union without\r\nthis member was not worthy of the name. The task of the Federalists was\r\nhere most difficult. Fully two thirds of the convention were at first\r\nopposed to the Constitution. The leadership of the Federalists fell to\r\nHamilton. Together with James Madison and John Jay, he contributed to\r\nthe newspapers a series of essays in advocacy of the Constitution,\r\nwhich, under the title _The Federalist_, have become a classic in our\r\npolitical literature. Just how the Federalists succeeded in overcoming a\r\nhostile majority and in securing a ratification of the Constitution by a\r\nvote of thirty to twenty-seven, remains a mystery to this day.\r\n\r\nHalf a century later it became the habit of statesmen of the nationalist\r\nschool to speak of the Constitution as the work of the people of the\r\nUnited States. John Marshall declared the Constitution to be \"an\r\nexpression of the clear and deliberate will of the whole people.\" As a\r\nmatter of fact, no direct popular vote was taken at any stage in its\r\nevolution. The delegates to the Philadelphia Convention were chosen by\r\nthe state legislatures; their work was ratified by conventions of\r\ndelegates in the several States; and these delegates were chosen in\r\nevery State but one on a carefully limited suffrage. New York alone\r\nprovided that delegates to the convention should be elected on the basis\r\nof manhood suffrage. Elsewhere property qualifications were imposed\r\nwhich disfranchised probably about one third of the adult male\r\npopulation. In all the States a considerable proportion of the voters\r\nabstained from voting. In Boston, where twenty-seven hundred were\r\nqualified to vote, only seven hundred and sixty took the trouble to\r\nvote for delegates to the state convention. A recent writer hazards the\r\nguess that \"not more than one fourth or one fifth of the adult white\r\nmales took part in the election of delegates to the state conventions.\"\r\nIf this be true, the Constitution expressed something less than the will\r\nof the whole people and perhaps not even of a majority. The making of\r\nthe Constitution was clearly the work of a party rather than of the\r\nwhole people. In the ranks of the Federalist party were the wealth and\r\nintelligence which made possible concerted and rapid action. The\r\nleadership fell naturally to those who had been accustomed to public\r\nlife. From this point of view, the adoption of the Constitution was the\r\ntriumph of a \"natural aristocracy.\"\r\n\r\nMeantime, Congress nearing its end made testamentary provision for its\r\nheir. After much wrangling and vacillation, it fixed upon New York as\r\nthe seat of the new Government and summoned the States to choose\r\npresidential electors, Senators, and Representatives. The new national\r\nlegislature was to assemble on the first Wednesday in March, which fell\r\nupon the 4th. To this summons, two States turned a deaf ear. Not having\r\nratified the new Constitution, North Carolina and Rhode Island were\r\nstrangely circumstanced. Of all the States which had entered into the\r\n\"firm league of friendship,\" they alone remained loyal--loyal, but\r\ndiscredited.\r\n\r\n\r\n     BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\r\n\r\n     Full accounts of the work of the Federal Convention may be found\r\n     in the histories of Bancroft and Curtis; briefer accounts, in the\r\n     volumes already cited, by McMaster, Fiske, McLaughlin, and\r\n     Channing. A succinct narrative is given by Max Farrand, _The\r\n     Framing of the Constitution_ (1913). A suggestive volume, treating\r\n     of the Constitution as the resultant of conflicting economic\r\n     interests, is C. A. Beard's _An Economic Interpretation of the\r\n     Constitution of the United States_ (1913). Among the special\r\n     studies of the ratification of the Constitution may be mentioned,\r\n     O. G. Libby, _The Geographical Distribution of the Vote of the\r\n     Thirteen States on the Federal Constitution, 1787-1788_ (1888);\r\n     McMaster and Stone, _Pennsylvania and the Federal Constitution,\r\n     1787-1788_ (1888); S. B. Harding, _The Contest over the\r\n     Ratification of the Federal Constitution in the State of\r\n     Massachusetts_ (1896); and F. G. Bates, _Rhode Island and the\r\n     Formation of the Union_ (1898). The most illuminating notes of the\r\n     debates in the Convention were those taken by James Madison, which\r\n     are printed in the _Records of the Federal Convention_ (3 vols.,\r\n     edited by Farrand, 1911). The most valuable commentary on the\r\n     Constitution is still _The Federalist_, written by Madison,\r\n     Hamilton, and Jay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE RESTORATION OF PUBLIC CREDIT\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The people have been ripened by misfortune for the reception of a good\r\ngovernment,\" Washington wrote to Jefferson, in the midsummer of 1788.\r\n\"They are emerging from the gulf of dissipation and debt into which they\r\nhad precipitated themselves at the close of the war. Economy and\r\nindustry are evidently gaining ground.\" There is, indeed, abundant\r\nevidence that thrift and enterprise were steadily banishing hard times.\r\nThe task of establishing the new government was made incomparably easier\r\nby the confidence inspired by returning prosperity.\r\n\r\nAlready West India commerce had resumed very nearly its old volume. Both\r\nFrance and Spain had made concessions to vessels which came to the\r\nisland ports laden with American produce. The Dutch and the Danish\r\nislands had always been kept open to American trade; and evidence is not\r\nwanting that the needs of British West India planters were stronger than\r\ntheir respect for orders in council. At all events, by hook or crook,\r\nAmerican farm products and lumber found their way to British planters as\r\nwell as to their French competitors. But something more than the\r\nresumption of the West India traffic was needed to restore prosperity.\r\nNecessity drove American sea captains to longer voyages and larger\r\nventures. American vessels found their way in increasing numbers through\r\nthe Baltic to Russia, and around Cape Horn to the Pacific ports, to\r\nChina, and to the East Indies. One of the pioneers of this traffic to\r\nthe Far East was Captain Robert Gray, of Boston, who, in his ship, the\r\nColumbia, doubled the Cape of Good Hope and completed the first American\r\nvoyage around the world.\r\n\r\nWhile hardy seamen were seeking new markets, American ingenuity was\r\ntrying to reproduce the machinery which was coming into use in England\r\nfor the manufacture of textiles. In the year 1789, Pennsylvania was\r\nmanufacturing cotton cloths, hats, and \"all articles in leather,\" while\r\nMassachusetts was making cordage, duck, and glass. \"The number of shoes\r\nmade in one town, and nails in another, is incredible,\" wrote\r\nWashington. When Hamilton made his famous report on manufactures two\r\nyears later, he described some seventeen industries which had already\r\nattained considerable proficiency, though nearly all of these were\r\ncarried on in the household.\r\n\r\nThe dawn of the 4th of March was saluted by the guns at the Battery in\r\nNew York and by the ringing of church bells. This day was to witness the\r\ninauguration of the new Government. Delusive expectation! The dilatory\r\nhabits of a decade were not so readily unlearned. To the amusement of\r\nill-wishers, barely a score of Congressmen appeared in the city; and the\r\ncarpenters were still at work remodeling the old City Hall into a\r\nfitting habitation for the new Federal Congress. It was not until the\r\n30th that enough Representatives were in attendance to make up a quorum\r\nand to permit the House to organize. Another week passed before the\r\nSenate could organize.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of April, the Senate summoned the House to attend the\r\ncounting of the electoral votes. It then appeared that George Washington\r\nhad received the highest number (69) and John Adams the next highest\r\n(34). This happy result had not been achieved without some concerted\r\naction among the Federalist leaders. The great personal influence of\r\nWashington was needed, indeed, to give dignity to the new office. While\r\nmessengers were hastening to inform Washington and Adams of their\r\nelection, the members of Congress had ample opportunities to look each\r\nother over. If they were not well known to each other, they were at\r\nleast conspicuous in their respective communities. Nearly every man had\r\nheld public office under his State Government and a large proportion had\r\nsat in the state conventions which had ratified the Constitution. Over\r\ntwo thirds of the Representatives counted themselves Federalist, or at\r\nleast friends of the new Constitution.\r\n\r\n[Map: Distribution of Population 1790\r\n(Indian Tribes beyond the settled area)]\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of April, the Senate and House in joint session received the\r\nPresident-elect. With simple ceremonies as befitted the occasion, the\r\ninauguration of our first President was consummated. Stepping from the\r\nSenate chamber upon the balcony, Washington looked out upon the crowds\r\nwhich thronged Wall Street. The Chancellor of New York administered the\r\noath, the populace shouted, \"Long live George Washington, President of\r\nthe United States!\" and then the President withdrew to deliver his\r\ninaugural address.\r\n\r\nWhen the minutes of the Senate were read next day an incident occurred,\r\nwhich, trivial as it seems, was indicative of a spirit that may be truly\r\ncharacterized as American. The President's address was referred to as\r\n\"His most gracious Speech.\" In a moment the doughty Maclay, of\r\nPennsylvania, sprang to his feet with a vigorous protest. These were\r\nwords which savored of kingly authority and which were odious to the\r\npeople. He moved that they be struck out. Vice-President John Adams\r\nremonstrated mildly; he saw no objection to borrowing the practices of a\r\ngovernment under which we had lived so long and happily. Senator Maclay\r\nwas on his feet at once with the declaration that the sentiments of the\r\npeople had undergone a change adverse to royal government. Such a phrase\r\non the minutes of the Senate would immediately be represented as \"the\r\nfirst rung of the ladder in the ascent to royalty.\" Maclay had his way\r\nand the offensive phrase was erased. Much the same republican spirit\r\nappeared in the debate on titles. The Senate would have preferred to\r\naddress the President as \"His Highness, the President of the United\r\nStates and Protector of their Liberties\"; but the House insisted on\r\nhaving the plain title, \"President of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nEven before the inauguration, the House of Representatives had entered\r\nupon its first tariff debate, for an immediate revenue was needed if the\r\nwheels of government were to move. Madison was ready with a scheme of\r\ncustoms duties patterned very largely after the ill-fated project of\r\n1783. On all sides it was agreed that taxes should be external rather\r\nthan internal, upon foreign rather than domestic commerce. Madison\r\nadvocated duties upon \"articles of requisition likely to occasion the\r\nleast difficulty,\" such as spirituous liquors, molasses, wines, tea,\r\ncoffee, cocoa, pepper, and sugar. But almost at once the idea was\r\nbroached that indirect aid should be given to certain industries. The\r\nclash of opposing sectional interests appears even in this first debate.\r\nIn the end Madison's simple revenue measure was set aside. Specific\r\nduties were levied on more than thirty articles, and _ad valorem_ duties\r\nranging from five to fifteen per cent on all others. Revenue was still\r\nthe main object, but protective duties were deliberately grafted upon\r\nthe bill. Tonnage dues were fixed in a separate act, while still another\r\nact laid the foundations of our national fiscal administration. In every\r\nState, side by side with local officials, yet independent of state\r\ncontrol, there were to be collectors, surveyors of ports, inspectors,\r\nweighers, gaugers, measurers,--in short, so many living witnesses to the\r\nexistence of a self-sufficient central government.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress addressed itself to the work of establishing the executive\r\ndepartments, questions of constitutional interpretation thrust\r\nthemselves into the foreground. Experience under the Confederation\r\nproved the need of at least the three departments of foreign affairs,\r\nwar, and treasury. Bills to establish these departments were at once\r\nframed and favorably considered, but exception was taken to the\r\nprovisions making the heads of these departments, who were appointed by\r\nthe President and Senate, removable by the President alone. It was\r\nfinally agreed to assume that the President had the power to remove from\r\noffice. The act was therefore made to read, \"Whenever said principal\r\nofficer shall be removed by the President.\" In this wise, by legislative\r\nconstruction, the Constitution was expanded at many points in the early\r\nyears of the new Government.\r\n\r\nThe bill to establish the Treasury Department was drawn in accordance\r\nwith the ideas of Hamilton, for it was expected that he would be the\r\nfirst incumbent of the office. It may have been his well-known\r\npartiality for British institutions that caused the House to mistrust\r\nthe phrase which made it the duty of the Secretary \"to digest and report\r\nplans for the improvement and management of the revenue, and the support\r\nof the public credit.\" \"If we authorize him to prepare and report\r\nplans,\" argued Tucker, of Virginia, voicing that fear of executive\r\nauthority which was then instinctive, \"it will create an interference of\r\nthe executive with the legislative powers; it will abridge the\r\nparticular privilege of this House.... How can business originate in\r\nthis House, if we have it reported to us by the Minister of Finance?\"\r\nThe House was not minded to make Alexander Hamilton a Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer. The bill was amended to read, \"digest and prepare.\"\r\nSubsequently the House showed unmistakably its determination to assume\r\ndirection of the national revenues and expenditures.\r\n\r\nOne of the first concerns of Congress was to give substance to the\r\ncolorless statement of the Constitution that there should be one supreme\r\ncourt and such inferior courts as Congress should ordain and establish.\r\nOn the day following its organization, while the House was grappling\r\nwith the question of revenue, the Senate appointed a committee to bring\r\nin a bill to establish the federal courts. The chairman of this\r\ncommittee was Oliver Ellsworth, of Connecticut, who had sat on the bench\r\nof the Court of Appeals under the Confederation and who had been an\r\ninfluential member of the Federal Convention. The bill reported by the\r\ncommittee was substantially his work. It provided for a supreme court\r\nbench of six judges--a chief justice and five associates; for thirteen\r\ndistrict courts, each with a single judge; and for three circuit courts,\r\neach of which was to consist of two justices of the Supreme Court and a\r\ndistrict judge. Lengthy provisions in the act carefully delimited the\r\njurisdiction of these courts, and laid down the modes of procedure and\r\npractice in them. Of great importance was the twenty-fifth section,\r\nwhich provided for taking cases on appeal to the Supreme Court from the\r\nlower federal and state courts. The words of the act, by a fair\r\nimplication, would seem to confer upon the Supreme Court the power to\r\nreview the decision of a state court holding an act of the United States\r\nunconstitutional. It would seem to follow logically that the Supreme\r\nCourt might do also directly what it might do indirectly--declare an act\r\nof Congress void by reason of its repugnance to the Constitution.\r\nEllsworth, at least, held that in the discharge of their ordinary\r\nduties, the judges of the federal courts would have the right to\r\npronounce acts of Congress void when they stood in conflict with the\r\nConstitution. Attempts were made, in the course of the debate on the\r\nJudiciary Act, to strip the federal courts of all jurisdiction except in\r\nadmiralty and maritime cases. Many members of Congress agreed with\r\nMaclay in thinking that the Judiciary Act was calculated to draw all law\r\nbusiness into the federal courts. \"The Constitution is meant to swallow\r\nall the state constitutions, by degrees,\" averred the worthy Senator\r\nfrom Pennsylvania; \"and this [bill] to swallow, by degrees, all the\r\nstate judiciaries.\"\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of the new President appeared in his appointments to office.\r\nConcerned solely with the fate of the federal experiment, he sought\r\nconsistently the support of those who would add weight to the new\r\nGovernment, and who were Federalists in politics. Not only personal\r\nfitness but sectional interests had to be taken into consideration.\r\nWashington was solicitous to draw \"the first characters of the union\"\r\ninto the judiciary, particularly those who had served in the state\r\ncourts and commanded public confidence. His choice for Chief Justice\r\nfell upon John Jay. Rutledge, of South Carolina, Wilson, of\r\nPennsylvania, Cushing, of Massachusetts, Harrison, of Maryland, and\r\nBlair, of Virginia, were first named as Associate Justices. Washington\r\nchose his chief advisers also from different sections. Thomas Jefferson\r\nwas invited to become Secretary of State--a post which he accepted\r\nsomewhat reluctantly. Hamilton did not have to be urged to take the\r\nheadship of the Treasury. Knox was given the superintendence of a\r\nmilitary establishment which then numbered only a few hundred men.\r\nEdmund Randolph was appointed Attorney-General.\r\n\r\nBefore Congress adjourned in the fall, it adopted and sent to the States\r\nfor ratification twelve amendments to the new Constitution. There were\r\nthose who thought this action precipitate. Why tinker with a\r\nconstitution which had hardly been tried? To all such Madison replied\r\ncogently that the amendments which his committee reported did not alter\r\nthe framework of the instrument, but added only certain safeguards to\r\nindividual rights. The lack of a declaration of rights had been deplored\r\nin every convention and had cost the support of many respectable people.\r\nMoreover, two communities had not yet \"thrown themselves into the bosom\r\nof the Confederacy.\" The wisdom of this course was attested by the\r\nprompt ratification of ten of the twelve proposed amendments.\r\n\r\nOn November 21, 1789, North Carolina ratified the Constitution, leaving\r\nRhode Island to a position of hazardous isolation. Congress was\r\nconsidering a bill to cut off the commercial privileges of the State, by\r\nputting her on the footing of a foreign nation, when news came that a\r\nconvention at Newport had ratified the Constitution by the narrow margin\r\nof two votes. In the following year the number of States was increased\r\nby the admission of Vermont. The admission of Kentucky followed in 1792;\r\nand Congress paved the way for the entrance of other States into the\r\nUnion by organizing the Southwest Territory out of Western lands ceded\r\nby the three southernmost States. The expansion of the United States had\r\nbegun, bringing with it unforeseen problems.\r\n\r\nThe severest labors of Congress began in the second session, when the\r\nnew Secretary of the Treasury presented his first report on public\r\ncredit. Shortly after the Convention of 1787, Hamilton had expressed his\r\nbelief that one of the great dangers which threatened American society\r\nwas \"the depredations which the democratic spirit is apt to make on\r\nproperty.\" Distrusting the political capacity of the people, whom in\r\nprivate he called \"a great beast,\" he believed that the new Government\r\nwould succeed or fail in just the proportion that it enlisted the\r\nsupport of the influential and wealthy classes. He set himself\r\ndeliberately to the task of identifying the interests of the propertied\r\nclasses with those of the Government.\r\n\r\nIt was a sorry state in which Hamilton found the national finances. The\r\nforeign debt, including principal and arrears of interest, amounted to\r\n$11,710,000. The domestic debt, much more difficult to determine, was\r\nnot less than $42,414,000, about one third of which was made up of\r\narrears of interest. The debts of the individual States, principal and\r\ninterest, were estimated at about $25,000,000. These were heavy burdens\r\nfor the shoulders of a young Government whose fiscal powers were as yet\r\nuntested. But the shoulders had to be fitted to the burden, if public\r\ncredit was to be restored.\r\n\r\nIn this first report on public credit, January 9, 1790, Hamilton\r\nanalyzed the financial situation with masterly clearness and set forth\r\nhis plans for the adjustment of the national debt. The determination of\r\nCongress to make adequate provision for the support of the public credit\r\nwas justified in his mind by every consideration. A country like the\r\nUnited States, possessed of little active wealth, must borrow in\r\nemergencies; to borrow on good terms, it must establish its credit; and\r\nto maintain its credit, it must faithfully observe its contracts. But\r\nover and above these considerations, dictated by expediency, were\r\n\"immutable principles of moral obligation.\" Moreover, the national debt\r\nwas no ordinary obligation: it was \"the price of liberty.\" On all sides,\r\nit was agreed that the debt contracted abroad should be provided for in\r\nthe precise terms of the contracts.\r\n\r\nIt was only in regard to the domestic debt that differences of opinion\r\nwere likely to arise. The notes representing this debt were of all sorts\r\nand kinds. Much of it had changed hands and all of it had depreciated in\r\nvalue. Some of it still circulated as a monetary medium. The vital\r\nquestion was: how were the present holders to be paid? At the face value\r\nof the paper, or at the price for which it had been purchased? Hamilton\r\nargued firmly against any discrimination, both because it was a breach\r\nof contract and because it was a violation of the rights of a fair\r\nbuyer.\r\n\r\nWhen this part of Hamilton's plan came before Congress in concrete form,\r\nit gave rise to the bitterest debate which had been heard. That it would\r\ngive opportunity for immoderate speculation was plain enough; yet every\r\nalternative which aimed to do justice by both the original and the\r\npresent holder was confessedly inadequate, when a certificate of\r\nindebtedness, for example, had passed through several hands without\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was Hamilton's proposal made than a wild scramble began for\r\nthe possession of the hitherto worthless government paper. \"Couriers and\r\nrelay horses by land, and swift sailing pilot boats by sea, were flying\r\nin all directions,\" wrote Jefferson. \"Active partners and agents were\r\nassociated and employed in every state, town, and country neighborhood,\r\nand this paper was bought up at 5/ and even as low as 2/ in the pound,\r\nbefore the holder knew Congress had already provided for its redemption\r\nat par. Immense fortunes were thus filched from the poor and ignorant,\r\nand fortunes accumulated by those who had themselves been poor enough\r\nbefore.\"\r\n\r\n[Map: Vote on Assumption July 24, 1790]\r\n\r\nThe second part of the scheme outlined in Hamilton's first report\r\naroused even more bitter opposition. With a fine audacity he proposed\r\nthe assumption of state debts. It is difficult to believe that Hamilton\r\nwas perfectly ingenuous in stating his reasons for this move. He\r\napprehended, he said, that the States would be hampered in satisfying\r\ntheir creditors because they had surrendered one important source of\r\nrevenue to the central Government, duties on imports. In resorting to\r\nother means, the States might pass conflicting measures which would\r\noppose industry. Besides, the debts had been incurred in the cause of\r\nUnion and should be borne by all. But deeper than these reasons was\r\nprobably a political motive. Hamilton had no local attachments. A\r\nthoroughgoing nationalist, he saw in the claims of the States to\r\nautonomy only so many obstacles in the path of national unity. \"To\r\ncement more closely the Union of States\" by creating a solidarity of\r\nfinancial interests, was, indeed, the basal principle of his fiscal\r\nplans.\r\n\r\nThe wrath of Congressmen from States like Virginia, which had already\r\ndischarged most of their debts, knew no bounds. After they had practiced\r\nthrift and met their obligations, should they, forsooth, now aid their\r\nless provident sisters? The chief opponents of assumption came from the\r\nSouth, and the chief advocates from the North. South Carolina and New\r\nHampshire parted company with their neighbors, the one because it had a\r\nlarge debt and the other because it had not. Pennsylvania was divided on\r\nthis question. For a time the opposition was too strong to be overcome.\r\nOn May 25, 1790, an adverse vote seemed to seal the fate of \"Miss\r\nAssumption,\" as the wits of the day called this measure. Just at this\r\njuncture the question of the location of the future capital, which had\r\nbeen debated inconclusively during the first session, was revived. Here\r\nagain the North was arrayed against the South. Should the capital be\r\nlocated on the Potomac, as Maryland and the Southern States wished, or\r\nsomewhere in Pennsylvania? New York was now out of the question, and\r\nsince Pennsylvania would not support assumption, the New England States\r\nrather spitefully opposed the claims of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nHere was a situation which called for the _finesse_ of the politician.\r\nMight not votes for one project be traded for the other? Would the\r\nVirginia representatives abandon their opposition to assumption for the\r\nsake of locating the capital on the banks of the Potomac? It was at this\r\njuncture that Hamilton sought out Jefferson, whose influence over the\r\nCongressmen from Virginia was very considerable, and laid the project\r\nbefore him. With a readiness which he afterward regretted, Jefferson\r\nfell in with the scheme, and invited Hamilton and certain Virginia\r\nRepresentatives to dine at his table. In this comfortable fashion, over\r\ntheir wine, these gentlemen reached an amicable agreement. Such is\r\nJefferson's account, but the matter could not have been quite so simple,\r\nfor other Representatives than those from Virginia changed their votes\r\nand so contributed to the final settlement of the controversy. Nor is\r\nJefferson quite ingenuous when he afterward described himself as duped\r\nby Hamilton, for he had not shown himself averse to assumption at any\r\ntime. Be this as it may, Congress voted to assume the debts of the\r\nStates, and to remove the seat of government from Philadelphia after ten\r\nyears to a district ten miles square on the Potomac, which Washington\r\nwas to select.\r\n\r\nThe need of further revenue was now imperative. As Hamilton said in his\r\nsecond report on the public credit, the duties on imported articles had\r\nreached a point which might not be exceeded \"without contravening the\r\nsense of the body of the merchants.\" When Congress met for its third\r\nsession in December, 1790, Hamilton boldly urged what was perhaps as\r\nunpopular a tax as he could have proposed--a duty on distilled spirits.\r\nTo most Americans an excise was not only an internal tax, but as\r\nJefferson said, \"an infernal one.\" It was bound to fall with heavy\r\nweight upon the people of the interior who turned much of their corn and\r\nrye into whiskey, for more convenient transportation over the mountains\r\nto Eastern markets. But despite strenuous opposition the excise was\r\nvoted. It was, as a member of Congress expressed it, like \"drinking down\r\nthe national debt.\"\r\n\r\nIn this same report of December 13, 1790, Hamilton advocated the\r\nestablishment of a national bank. Such an institution, he believed,\r\nwould increase the amount of active capital in the country and at the\r\nsame time serve the Government as a fiscal agent in obtaining loans and\r\nin collecting taxes. Opposition to this project gathered rapidly and was\r\nencouraged by the Secretary of State. The debates in Congress touched\r\nupon the monopolistic tendency of such a banking institution and its\r\nconstitutionality, rather than upon its intrinsic merits and demerits.\r\nThe bill was carried by substantial majorities in February, 1791, and\r\nsent to the President for his approval.\r\n\r\nWashington was so beset with doubts as to the constitutionality of the\r\nbank bill that he asked his secretaries and the Attorney-General to\r\nexpress their opinions. Jefferson argued that the power to incorporate a\r\nbank was not given by the Constitution to Congress, for it was not among\r\nthe enumerated powers and it was not a power which belonged to any of\r\nthe enumerated powers as indispensably necessary to their exercise.\r\nHamilton deprecated this attempt to confine the general Government\r\neither to powers expressly granted or to powers absolutely necessary to\r\ncarry out the enumerated powers. There was another class, he contended,\r\nwhich might be termed \"resulting\" powers. If the end to be gained by a\r\nmeasure was comprehended within the specified powers, and the measure\r\nwas obviously a means to that end and not forbidden by the Constitution,\r\nthen it was clearly within the compass of the national authority.\r\nWashington finally yielded to Hamilton's persuasions, and signed the\r\nbill.\r\n\r\nThe charter of the bank fixed the capital stock at ten million dollars,\r\nof which the Government was to subscribe one fifth; the rest was open to\r\npublic subscription. Three fourths of the public subscriptions might be\r\npaid in bonds of the Government. The notes issued by the bank were made\r\nreceivable for all payments to the United States. The bank was to be the\r\nrepository of the government funds. Its management was committed to a\r\nboard of twenty-five directors chosen annually, who could establish\r\nbranch banks as they deemed advisable. The charter was to run for twenty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe stock of the bank was not only subscribed at once, but soon sold at\r\na premium which invited the wildest sort of speculation in Philadelphia,\r\nNew York, and Boston. Stock-jobbing became a mania. \"The coffee house is\r\nin an eternal buzz with the gamblers,\" Madison wrote from the seat of\r\ngovernment. Sinister aspects of this speculative craze soon began to\r\nappear. \"Of all the shameful circumstances of this business,\" said\r\nMadison, \"it is among the greatest to see the members of the Legislature\r\nwho were most active in pushing this job openly grasping its\r\nemoluments.\" It was reported that Schuyler, Hamilton's father-in-law,\r\nwas to head the board of directors.\r\n\r\nAs the wide reach of Hamilton's financial policy became clear, men like\r\nMadison, whose sympathies had hitherto been enlisted on the side of more\r\nefficient government, had grave misgivings. When the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury intimated in his report on manufactures that Congress might\r\npromote the general welfare by appropriating money in any way it chose,\r\nMadison definitely parted company with his former collaborator, holding\r\nthat by such an interpretation of the Constitution \"the Government is no\r\nlonger a limited one possessing enumerated powers, but an indefinite\r\none, subject to particular restrictions.\" Jefferson had already\r\nexpressed himself in a similar way apropos of the bank bill. The\r\nsuspicions which the Secretary of State entertained of his brilliant\r\ncolleague were deep-seated. Hamilton's well-known preference for the\r\nBritish Constitution and his disposition to convert his secretaryship\r\ninto a sort of chief ministerial office confirmed Jefferson's distrust.\r\nHad he and Madison been alone in their suspicions, their misgivings\r\nwould not be worth recording; but they voiced the sentiments of an\r\nincreasing number of men who disliked the consolidating tendencies of\r\nthe new Government.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the aristocratic tone of Washington and his _entourage_ gave\r\ndeep offense. Both by disposition and by calculation the President\r\ncultivated a certain official etiquette. His receptions were formal to\r\nthe point of frigidity. He received his visitors \"with a dignified bow,\r\nwhile his hands were so disposed as to indicate that the salutation was\r\nnot to be accompanied with shaking hands.\" His figure clad in black\r\nvelvet was most impressive. His hair was powdered and gathered in a\r\nlarge silk bag. His hands were dressed in yellow gloves, and he carried\r\na cocked hat adorned with a black feather, while at his side hung a\r\nsword in a scabbard of white polished leather. To ardent republicans\r\nthese trappings were so many manifestations of monarchical leanings.\r\nHamilton's suggestion that coins should bear the head of the President\r\nunder whom they were minted, was additional evidence to suspicious minds\r\nthat the group of men who had the President's ear were monarchists at\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nBefore the First Congress adjourned, the nucleus of a new party was at\r\nhand and its fundamental tenet roughly foreshadowed: namely, opposition\r\nto the increase of the powers of the Federal Government through the use\r\nof implied powers and at the expense of the State Governments. The\r\nappearance of the first number of the _National Gazette_ under the\r\neditorship of Philip Freneau was a sign that the further conduct of the\r\nAdministration would be subjected to searching criticism. Freneau\r\nsucceeded admirably in voicing the opinions of the nascent party. The\r\ncolumns of the _National Gazette_ had much to say about \"aristocratic\r\njuntos,\" \"ministerial systems,\" and \"the control of the government by a\r\nwealthy body of capitalists and public creditors,\" whose interests were\r\nin opposition to those of the people. When Hamilton's paper, the _United\r\nStates Gazette_, attempted to stigmatize the opposition as essentially\r\nAnti-Federalist, Freneau replied that only those men were true friends\r\nof the Union who adhered to a limited and republican form of government\r\nand who were ready to resist the efforts which had been made \"to\r\nsubstitute, in the room of our equal republic, a baneful monarchy.\" By\r\nposing as the only stanch supporters of republicanism, the opposition\r\nsecured a great tactical advantage. To call one's self emphatically a\r\nRepublican was to cast aspersions upon the republicanism of one's\r\nopponents.\r\n\r\nAs yet, however, there existed only tendencies toward parties and not\r\nclearly defined political groups. The voting in the early sessions of\r\nCongress was far from consistent. The members gave little indication\r\nthat they regarded themselves as adherents of parties whose fortunes\r\ndepended on preserving an unbroken alignment for or against the\r\nGovernment. How little coherence the opposition possessed was apparent\r\nwhen Giles, of Virginia, presented a resolution censuring Hamilton for\r\nhis management of the Treasury. Despite the unpopularity of Hamilton and\r\nthe general distrust of his policy in Republican circles, the opposition\r\ncould muster only seven votes in favor of the resolution, in the closing\r\nhours of the Second Congress.\r\n\r\nThe presidential election of 1792, therefore, was not properly a contest\r\nbetween parties. When Washington consented reluctantly to serve a second\r\nterm, his unopposed reelection was assured. The Republicans expressed\r\ntheir opposition only by supporting for Vice-President, George Clinton,\r\nof New York, whose Anti-Federalism was well known, instead of John\r\nAdams, of Massachusetts. The congressional elections of this year\r\nresulted in the choice of men whose leanings were rather Republican than\r\nFederalist.\r\n\r\n\r\n     BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\r\n\r\n     Besides the works of Hildreth and of McMaster, there are several\r\n     compendious histories which treat of the beginnings of the new\r\n     government. Among these are James Schouler, _History of the United\r\n     States under the Constitution_ (7 vols., 1880-1913), and E. M.\r\n     Avery, _History of the United States and its People from their\r\n     Earliest Records to the Present Time_ (7 vols., 1904- ). The events\r\n     of the Administrations of Washington and Adams are narrated by J.\r\n     S. Bassett, _The Federalist System_ (in _The American Nation_,\r\n     vol. 11, 1906). Among the special studies of importance are D. R.\r\n     Dewey, _Financial History of the United States_ (1903); C. R.\r\n     Fish, _The Civil Service and the Patronage_ (1905); H. B. Learned,\r\n     _The President's Cabinet_ (1912); and W. W. Willoughby, _The\r\n     Supreme Court of the United States_ (1890). There are many\r\n     biographies of the Federalist leaders. Among the best are W. C.\r\n     Ford, _George Washington_ (2 vols., 1900); W. G. Sumner,\r\n     _Alexander Hamilton_ (1890); F. S. Oliver, _Alexander Hamilton; an\r\n     Essay on American Union_ (1907); J. T. Morse, _John Adams_ (1885);\r\n     W. G. Brown, _Life of Oliver Ellsworth_ (1905). Of contemporary\r\n     writings none will give a more intimate view of politics than\r\n     Senator William Maclay's _Journal_ (1890). William Sullivan,\r\n     _Familiar Letters on Public Characters_ (1834), gives some lively\r\n     sketches of notable figures, but he writes with a strong\r\n     Federalist bias.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE TESTING OF THE NEW GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new Government fell heir to all the unsettled diplomatic problems of\r\nthe Confederation. The political destiny of the thirteen States seemed\r\nfixed when they ratified the Constitution; the fate of the Western\r\ncommunities beyond the Alleghanies still hung in the balance. In\r\nKentucky, General Wilkinson still intrigued in behalf of Spain. Sevier\r\nand Robertson, in Tennessee, were not averse to separation from the\r\nEastern States nor to a Spanish protectorate. From New Orleans, Mobile,\r\nSt. Marks, and Pensacola, the Spanish authorities supplied the Indians\r\nof the Southwest with arms and ammunition, counting on these uncertain\r\nallies to maintain their long frontier, for Spain still claimed Florida\r\nwith its most northern boundary and refused to accept the validity of\r\nthe British cession of 1783. More than this: Spain was disposed to claim\r\nboth sides of the Mississippi, at least as far north as the Ohio.\r\n\r\nIn the Northwest, British garrisons still held Michilimackinac, Detroit,\r\nNiagara, Oswego, and other posts. The policy of Great Britain was\r\ndictated by much the same considerations as was that of Spain. Lord\r\nDorchester, Governor of Canada, assured the home Government that \"the\r\nflimsy texture of republican government\" could not long hold the Western\r\nsettlements in the Union. In 1789, the Lords of Trade reported that it\r\nwas a matter of interest for Great Britain \"to prevent Vermont and\r\nKentucke, and all other settlements now forming in the Interior parts of\r\nthe great Continent of North America, from becoming dependent upon the\r\nGovernment of the United States, or of any other Foreign Country, and to\r\npreserve them on the contrary in a State of Independence and to induce\r\nthem to form Treaties of Commerce and Friendship with Great Britain.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Washington had hardly taken the oath of office when a war\r\ncloud appeared on the western horizon. Certain British vessels, bound\r\nfor Nootka Sound to establish a trading-post, were seized by Spanish\r\nauthorities in a way which provoked bitter resentment. In the early\r\nmonths of 1790, war seemed imminent. The situation was full of peril for\r\nthe United States, for war would inevitably bring about military\r\noperations directed against Florida and Louisiana, and neither party was\r\nlikely to respect the neutrality of the United States. The prospect of a\r\nconquest of the Spanish colonies by Great Britain alarmed the\r\nAdministration. \"Embraced from the St. Croix to the St. Mary's on the\r\none side by their possessions, on the other side by their fleet,\" wrote\r\nJefferson, \"we need not hesitate to say that they would soon find means\r\nto unite to them all the territory covered by the ramifications of the\r\nMississippi.\" Representations were therefore made to the British\r\nGovernment that \"a due balance on our borders is not less desirable to\r\nus than a balance of power in Europe has always appeared to them.\"\r\n\r\nFortunately the war cloud vanished as rapidly as it had formed. In the\r\nfall of 1790, Spain and England entered into a convention which averted\r\nhostilities. Yet the situation on both flanks of our long frontier was\r\nfull of peril. Spain intrigued with the Creeks of the Southwest, while\r\nthe British authorities in Canada encouraged the Indians north of the\r\nOhio in their hostility to the white settlers. The attitude of the\r\nIndians along the Maumee and Wabash Rivers was so menacing that Governor\r\nSt. Clair sent a punitive expedition against them; but the effect upon\r\nthe Indians was so slight that a second expedition was set on foot in\r\nthe following year. With a force of fourteen hundred raw recruits,\r\nunused to Indian warfare, St. Clair marched into the heart of the Indian\r\ncountry and suffered an inglorious defeat, on November 4, 1791. More\r\nthan half of his command were killed, and scarcely a man escaped\r\nunscathed. It was a most humiliating reverse for the new Government,\r\noccurring almost under the eyes of British garrisons, and just as\r\nopposition was coming to a head in Congress.\r\n\r\nWhile two European powers were thus poised like vultures awaiting the\r\ndemise of the new republic, a third darkened the sky. France deemed the\r\nmoment auspicious for an attack upon the colonial possessions of her\r\nlate ally, the King of Spain. The South American revolutionist, Miranda,\r\nhad persuaded the French Ministry, as he had before persuaded Pitt, that\r\nthe Spanish colonial empire was tottering and would readily fall with\r\nits rich spoil at the first resolute attack. The French Ministers were\r\ndazzled by the prospect of reviving a colonial empire in the new world.\r\nIt seemed well within the range of possibilities to reduce Louisiana,\r\nand from the mouth of the Mississippi to begin the conquest of Spanish\r\nCentral and Southern America. With this purpose in view, the Government\r\nsent as Minister to the United States, Citizen Genet, an ardent apostle\r\nof the Revolution. He was instructed to secure a treaty with the United\r\nStates--\"a true family compact\"--which \"would conduce rapidly to freeing\r\nSpanish America, to opening the navigation of the Mississippi to the\r\ninhabitants of Kentucky, to delivering our ancient brothers of Louisiana\r\nfrom the tyrannical yoke of Spain, and perhaps to uniting the fair star\r\nof Canada to the American constellation.\" But without waiting for the\r\ncooperation of the United States, Genet was to arouse the people of\r\nKentucky and Louisiana by sending among them agents who should light the\r\nfires of revolution.\r\n\r\n[Map: The Northwest 1785-1795]\r\n\r\nThe first news of the revolution in France had kindled the warmest\r\nsympathy in the United States. Emotional individuals thought they saw\r\nthe events of our own revolution mirrored in the stirring drama in\r\nFrance. The spectacle of the new republic confronting the allied\r\nmonarchs of Europe thrilled those who had battled with the hirelings of\r\nGeorge the Third. Civic feasts became the fashion; liberty caps and\r\nFrench cockades were donned; \"the social and soul-warming term Citizen\"\r\nwas adopted by the more demonstrative. But there were those who did not\r\nsing \"Ca Ira\" and who foresaw the peril of a general European war.\r\n\r\nEarly in April, 1793, a British packet brought the news to New York that\r\nLouis XVI had been guillotined and that France was at war with England\r\nand Spain. The ominous tidings brought President Washington post-haste\r\nfrom Mount Vernon to Philadelphia. Summoning his advisers, he put before\r\nthem the perplexing questions which had arisen in his mind. Neutrality\r\nwas obviously the policy which national self-interest dictated; but\r\nneutrality seemed hardly compatible with our treaty obligations to\r\nFrance. In the treaties of 1778, the United States had expressly\r\nguaranteed French possessions in America and had opened its ports to\r\nFrench privateers and their prizes, denying the privilege to her\r\nenemies. Hamilton argued rather fallaciously that these treaties were\r\nmade by the King of France and were binding upon his successors alone;\r\nthey were not in force after the Revolutionary Government had destroyed\r\nthe monarchy. Furthermore, the guaranty did not apply to an offensive\r\nwar such as that which France was now waging. Jefferson and Randolph\r\ntook issue with Hamilton on these points; but all agreed that neutrality\r\nmust be preserved. On April 22, the President issued a proclamation,\r\nwhich, avoiding the word \"neutrality,\" declared that the United States\r\nwas at peace with both France and Great Britain, and warned all citizens\r\nto avoid all acts of hostility.\r\n\r\nThe proclamation was well-timed, for Genet had already landed at\r\nCharleston and had begun his extraordinary career as revolutionary agent\r\nof the Gironde. He found the ground well watered for the seeds of\r\nrevolution. In Georgia and South Carolina, the frontiersmen were\r\nsmarting under the repeated depredations of the Cherokees and Creeks and\r\neager to put an end to Spanish ascendancy in that quarter. Under these\r\ncircumstances it was no difficult matter to arrange for expeditions\r\nagainst St. Augustine from the Georgia frontier, and against New Orleans\r\nfrom South Carolina by way of the Tennessee River and the Mississippi.\r\nAssuming that the United States was already enlisted in the cause by the\r\ntreaties of 1778, Genet sent out orders to French consuls, bidding them\r\nset up courts of admiralty for the trial of prize cases, and even\r\ndispatched privateers from the port of Charleston to prey upon British\r\nvessels. Before Genet could reach Philadelphia, the French frigate\r\nL'Ambuscade had captured the Little Sarah in lower Delaware Bay, and had\r\nanchored with her prize in the river opposite the city.\r\n\r\nFrom Charleston, Genet made a triumphal progress to Philadelphia,\r\nreceiving on all sides demonstrations which convinced him that the heart\r\nof the nation beat in unison with that of France. He was therefore much\r\ndisconcerted and angered by the studied reserve of the President, to\r\nwhom he presented his credentials in Philadelphia. What a contrast\r\nbetween the liberty-loving populace and this haughty aristocrat who kept\r\nmedallions of Capet and his family upon his parlor walls! At a banquet\r\nin Oeller's Tavern, however, Genet received the sort of demonstrations\r\nwhich his French heart craved. There, amid poetic declamations and many\r\nlibations to the Goddess of Liberty, he and his hosts donned the crimson\r\ncap of liberty and sang with infinite zest the new \"Marseillaise.\" Even\r\na well-balanced mind might have become convinced that the Administration\r\nand the people were out of accord.\r\n\r\nOn the threshold of his career at Philadelphia, Genet demanded an\r\nadvance payment on the debt which the United States owed to France. The\r\nrefusal of the Administration to supply him with funds embittered him\r\nstill further. He now took up with vigor his revolutionary projects in\r\nthe West. The proposal of George Rogers Clark to raise a force and take\r\nall Louisiana for France reached him at this time and fitted in well\r\nwith his general mission. Clark was given a commission as \"Major General\r\nof the Independent and Revolutionary Legion of the Mississippi,\" and was\r\npromised the cooperation of frigates in his attack upon New Orleans. For\r\nthis purpose Genet made haste to transform the Little Sarah into a\r\nprivateer, under the very eyes of the Government. He was warned that he\r\nmust not allow La Petite Democrate, as the vessel was rechristened, to\r\nput to sea. Nevertheless, in defiance of the state and federal\r\nauthorities, the ship dropped down the bay and eventually put out to\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nUp to this moment Genet's popularity was immense. Very probably this\r\npopular devotion to the cause of France was inspired in part by the\r\nfactious opposition which was irritating the Administration on purely\r\ndomestic issues. Nevertheless, Liberty, Equality, and the Rights of Man\r\nwere phrases which appealed cogently to the democratic masses in the\r\nStates. In imitation of the Jacobin Club, Democratic societies sprang up\r\nin all the considerable centers of population from Boston to Charleston.\r\nIn these organizations the voice of the disfranchised classes was\r\narticulate for the first time. With unprecedented virulence these\r\nDemocrats attacked not only policies but personalities. Washington was\r\nlibeled in such scurrilous fashion that even his composure broke down on\r\none occasion, so Jefferson records; and he declared in a passion that by\r\nGod! he had rather be in his grave than in his present situation.\r\n\r\nAfter the Little Democrat episode, however, popular sentiment began to\r\ngrow cold toward Genet. His plans failed to carry; and he was reported\r\nto have exclaimed in a moment of irritation that he would appeal from\r\nthe President to the people. This was the last straw. All but his most\r\nradical followers deserted him. The Administration now determined to\r\ndemand his recall. But events in France had already terminated Genet's\r\ncareer. The Girondist party had fallen and the triumphant Jacobins had\r\nno use for an agent who had served the discredited faction. In February,\r\n1794, Genet was replaced by Fauchet and his revolutionary mission ended\r\nwith his official duties.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment when France declared war upon Great Britain to the exile\r\nof Napoleon two decades later, the United States as a neutral nation was\r\nincessantly menaced by the aggressions of one or the other of the\r\nbelligerents. A faithful picture of American politics must set the\r\nstirring events of this epoch against the forbidding background of\r\nEuropean intrigue and war. In this struggle the supremacy of the seas\r\nfell to Great Britain. However victorious on European battlefields,\r\nFrench armies were powerless to defend the colonial possessions in the\r\nWest Indies. Cut off from France the colonies could only maintain\r\nthemselves by direct trade with neutrals like the United States. But by\r\nthe so-called rule of 1756, neutral commerce was forbidden under these\r\nconditions. Ports closed to neutral commerce in time of peace might not\r\nbe thrown open in time of war. Flinging consistency to the winds, the\r\nFrench Convention decreed in February, 1793, that neutral states might\r\ntrade with her colonies on the same terms as French vessels. That Great\r\nBritain would refuse to sanction this trade was fully expected. It was\r\ninevitable that Great Britain would treat neutrals who accepted the\r\nFrench invitation as having forfeited their neutrality.\r\n\r\nWith little or no thought of probable consequences, fleets of\r\nmerchantmen set sail from Boston, Philadelphia, and other ports in the\r\nspring of the year, with cargoes of fish and grain to barter for sugar,\r\ncoffee, and rum at Martinique, Antigua, and St. Kitts. The traffic\r\npromised to be most lucrative. But disaster overtook many a gallant\r\nvessel before she could reach her destination. In June, British orders\r\nin council instructed English cruisers to detain all vessels bound for a\r\nFrench port with corn, flour, and meal, and to purchase such supplies as\r\nwere needed. Such vessels were then to be allowed to proceed to any port\r\nof a state with which His Majesty was living in amity. The skipper who\r\nhad anything worth taking to a foreign port after an experience of this\r\nsort was lucky indeed. In November orders were issued for the seizure of\r\nall vessels laden with French colonial products or carrying provisions\r\nto any French colony.\r\n\r\nTales of outrages perpetrated under the British orders in council soon\r\nbegan to reach the home ports of the West India merchantmen. Doubtless\r\nthese tales lost nothing in the telling, but the unimpeachable fact\r\nremains that scores of American ships were seized and libeled in\r\nadmiralty courts set up in the British West Indies. Nor did the British\r\nnaval officers hesitate to impress seamen who were suspected of being\r\nBritish subjects. Republican opponents of the Administration, who had\r\nfelt the proclamation of neutrality as a rebuff to our old ally, France,\r\nwere now confirmed in their hostility to Great Britain. To their minds\r\nample cause for war existed.\r\n\r\nThe policy which Jefferson and Madison would have forced upon the\r\nAdministration was one of retaliation. In a report to Congress Jefferson\r\nproposed that whenever our commerce was laid under restrictions by a\r\nforeign nation, similar restrictions should be put upon the trade of the\r\noffending state. By pacific coercion, the United States would oblige\r\nforeign states to make favorable commercial treaties. Madison urged this\r\npolicy upon Congress in a series of resolutions; but the supporters of\r\nthe Administration pointed out that retaliatory measures would sacrifice\r\nthe trade with Great Britain, which furnished seven eighths of the total\r\nimports into the country. It was plain that the mercantile classes which\r\nupheld the Administration did not desire either war or retaliatory\r\nlegislation, however much they might be suffering from British\r\ndepredations. The resources of diplomacy were not yet exhausted. Might\r\nnot a treaty be secured which would open up the British West India\r\ntrade?\r\n\r\nUpon the news of the offensive orders in council of November, which\r\nreached Philadelphia in the following March, public feeling veered\r\nstrongly toward war. At the same time with tales of new outrages at sea\r\ncame a not very well authenticated but commonly accepted report of Lord\r\nDorchester's speech to the Indians of the Northwest, in which he\r\nassured his dusky hearers that war was imminent between his country and\r\nthe United States. Congress now began to prepare for the inevitable.\r\nAppropriations were made for the fortification of harbors and the\r\ncollection of military stores. The depredations of the Algerine pirates\r\nin the Mediterranean gave excuse for the building of six frigates. An\r\nembargo was laid upon commerce for thirty days and then extended over\r\nanother thirty days. Dayton, of New Jersey, alarmed the administration\r\nparty by proposing the sequestration of all British debts as an\r\nindemnity for the vessels which had been seized by British cruisers.\r\n\r\nA rift now appeared in the war cloud. Early in April, Washington\r\nreceived intelligence of a new order in council dated January 8, 1794,\r\nwhich only forbade trade between the French colonies and Europe, leaving\r\nAmerican vessels to trade freely with the French West Indies. Washington\r\nseized the opportune moment to test the resources of diplomacy. On April\r\n16, he sent to the Senate the nomination of Chief Justice John Jay as\r\nEnvoy Extraordinary to the Court of St. James. Three days later the\r\nnomination was confirmed, and by the middle of May, Jay was on his way\r\nto England upon the most difficult mission of his diplomatic career.\r\n\r\nWhile Jay was pressing American grievances upon Lord Grenville, not the\r\nleast of which was the retention of the Western posts by British\r\ngarrisons, events occurred near one of the unsurrendered posts which\r\nmight easily have brought on war. The humiliating defeat of St. Clair\r\nin 1791 had left the settlers beyond the Ohio at the mercy of the\r\nIndians. British authorities in Canada encouraged the Indians to believe\r\nthat by combination they could check the advance of the whites. An\r\nIndian territory under British protection would have served the purposes\r\nof Great Britain admirably. To forestall these designs President\r\nWashington appointed to command in the Northwest Anthony Wayne--\"Mad\r\nAnthony\" of Revolutionary days. With a caution and thoroughness which\r\nbelied his reputation, Wayne spent nearly two years in recruiting and\r\ndrilling an army. Every effort in the mean time to conciliate the\r\nIndians was made futile by the machinations of their British advisers.\r\nBy the spring of 1794, Wayne had an army sufficiently trustworthy to\r\nundertake a forward movement. His route lay down the Maumee River, at\r\nthe rapids of which Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe had built a fort and\r\nstationed a small garrison, in anticipation of an American attack upon\r\nDetroit, which was supposed to be Wayne's objective. At a place known as\r\nFallen Timber, a few miles south of the rapids, on August 18, Wayne\r\nfound the Indians ready to offer battle. They had chosen their ground\r\nwith considerable skill, but Wayne employed his cavalry and infantry so\r\neffectively that he drove the redskins from cover and pursued them with\r\ngreat slaughter almost to the walls of the British fort. The British\r\ncommander demanded an explanation. Wayne replied with a taunt which\r\namounted to a challenge and which was probably intended to be such; but\r\nthe British refused to be drawn into hostilities. Had Wayne attacked\r\nand dispersed the British garrison, he would hardly stand condemned at\r\nthe bar of history, for by the Treaty of Paris not he, but the British\r\ncommander, was the intruder on foreign soil. Nevertheless, war at this\r\ntime would have made Jay's mission futile and might have sacrificed the\r\nwhole Mississippi Valley.\r\n\r\nThe Administration had hardly time to applaud Wayne's victory when it\r\nwas greatly perturbed by an insurrectionary movement in western\r\nPennsylvania. The sturdy Scotch-Irish people of the southwestern\r\ncounties beyond the mountains had always felt their aloofness from the\r\neastern counties. They were now still further disaffected because of the\r\nfederal tax on spirituous liquors. They shared the feeling of the\r\nContinental Congress, which in 1774 had declared an excise \"the horror\r\nof all free states.\" Even before the incidence of the tax was fully\r\nfelt, protests were drafted at mass-meetings and federal collectors were\r\nroughly treated. The tax fell with heavy weight upon the small farmer.\r\nWhiskey was not merely his chief marketable commodity: it was also his\r\nmedium of exchange when money was scarce. A tax on his still seemed to\r\nbe an unfair discrimination. Such was the pitch of public feeling in the\r\nyear 1793 that farmers who complied with the law had their stills\r\nwrecked by masked men, popularly known as \"Whiskey Boys.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in July, 1794, the marshal of the district court of Philadelphia\r\nattempted to serve writs against distillers in the western counties who\r\nwere charged with breaking the law. He chose his time unwisely, for the\r\nfarmers were in the midst of harvesting, and liquor was circulating\r\nfreely among the laborers. In serving his last writ, he was threatened\r\nby a number of reapers. This was the spark needed to start a\r\nconflagration. On the next morning the house of a revenue inspector,\r\nNeville, was attacked and blood was shed. A small detachment of soldiers\r\nfrom Fort Pitt was stationed at the house; but on the following day they\r\nwere fired upon and forced to surrender, and the house of the inspector\r\nwas burned. The marshal and the inspector fled the country. Matters went\r\nfrom bad to worse. The mail was robbed; the militia was summoned to meet\r\nat Braddock's Field for the avowed purpose of attacking the garrison at\r\nFort Pitt; but there the courage of the leaders evaporated. The attack\r\nupon the garrison was commuted into a boisterous march through the\r\nstreets of Pittsburg, whose citizens purchased immunity by liberal\r\ndonations of whiskey to the thirsty rioters.\r\n\r\nOn August 7, 1794, the President issued a proclamation commanding the\r\ninsurgents to disperse, and summoned twelve thousand militia from the\r\nadjoining States to hold themselves in readiness for active service on\r\nthe 1st of September. Meanwhile, earnestly desiring to avoid the use of\r\nforce, Washington sent three commissioners to the scene of the riots in\r\nthe hope of appealing to the sober sense of the people. They held\r\nprotracted negotiations with representatives of the people in the\r\ndisaffected district, but were unable to persuade them to deliver up the\r\nringleaders of the revolt. On September 24, the President issued a\r\nsecond proclamation and set the troops in motion. Under the command of\r\n\"Light Horse Harry\" Lee, now Governor of Virginia, the army marched west\r\nin two divisions, but encountered no resistance. Many arrests were made\r\nand eighteen alleged leaders of the insurrection were sent to\r\nPhiladelphia for trial. Only two of these, however, were convicted of\r\ntreasonable conduct, and they were pardoned by the President. Some\r\ntwenty-five hundred troops were quartered near Pittsburg for the winter;\r\nbut rebellion did not again lift its head.\r\n\r\nThe utter collapse of the Whiskey Rebellion made the whole affair seem\r\nridiculous to those who gathered in the coffee-houses to hear the tales\r\nof the militiamen but the importance of the episode was not slight.\r\nHamilton is said to have remarked on one occasion that a government can\r\nnever be said to be established \"until some signal display of force has\r\nmanifested its power of military coercion.\" The Federal Government had\r\nnow demonstrated that it was equal to the emergency whenever the laws\r\nwere opposed by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the\r\nordinary course of judicial proceedings or by the powers vested in the\r\nmarshals by law. The days of Shays' Rebellion had gone, never to return.\r\n\r\nThere was an aspect of the insurrection which Washington did not fail to\r\nnote in his annual address to Congress in November, 1794. The Democratic\r\nclubs had been unsparing in their condemnation of the excise law, and\r\ntheir resolutions had more than once a treasonable sound. Washington did\r\nnot hesitate to deprecate the untoward influence of these \"self-created\r\nsocieties\" and to condemn those \"combinations of men, who, careless of\r\nconsequences, and disregarding the unerring truth that those who rouse\r\ncannot always appease a civil convulsion, have disseminated, from an\r\nignorance or perversion of facts, suspicions, jealousies, and\r\naccusations of the whole Government.\" The Democratic societies now fell\r\ninto disrepute and did not long survive their great prototype, the\r\nJacobin Club of Paris.\r\n\r\nAlthough Jay had presented his credentials in June, 1794, it was the\r\n19th of November before a treaty was signed; and it was not until the\r\n8th of June, 1795, that Washington could send an authentic copy to the\r\nSenate. The most dispassionate member of that body must have confessed\r\nprivately to a sense of disappointment as he heard the terms for the\r\nfirst time. Listening intently for the redress of grievances, he seemed\r\nto hear only concessions. The United States was to assume the debts\r\nstill unpaid to British merchants since the peace, so far as \"lawful\r\nimpediments\" had been put in the way of their collection; to open all\r\nports to British ships on the footing of the most favored nation; and to\r\nmake restitution for losses and damages to the property of British\r\nsubjects occasioned by French privateers in American waters, whenever\r\ncompensation could not be obtained in the ordinary course of justice.\r\nAnd for all these concessions what had been gained? The promise to\r\nevacuate the Western posts? That was but a tardy redemption of an old\r\npromise. No mention was made of the negroes carried away by British\r\narmies during the war. Nothing was said about the impressment of\r\nAmerican seamen. To be sure, the ports of the East Indies were to be\r\nopened to direct commerce with the United States; but no American vessel\r\nmight engage in the coasting trade of these East India dependencies. As\r\nfor the West India trade, only vessels of seventy tons burden might\r\nparticipate, and even that concession was yielded on the express\r\nunderstanding that molasses, sugar, coffee, cocoa, and cotton should not\r\nbe exported from the United States to any part of the world. After\r\nhearing this obnoxious twelfth article, few Senators could preserve a\r\nfair mind on the remaining provisions of the treaty.\r\n\r\nThe historian is in a better position to evaluate the treaty. To the\r\ncause of international arbitration, Jay and Grenville made a distinct\r\ncontribution. They provided for three commissions which were to settle\r\nthe uncertain boundaries of the United States on the northeast and\r\nnorthwest; to adjudicate the claims of British creditors; and to adjust\r\nthe claims of those citizens of the United States whose ships and\r\ncargoes had been seized in the West India trade, and on the other hand,\r\nthe claims of those British subjects who had suffered losses through\r\nFrench privateers in American waters. Moreover, an agreement was reached\r\non what should in future be regarded as contraband, and on the treatment\r\nof vessels which should be captured on suspicion of carrying enemies'\r\nproperty or contraband.\r\n\r\nThere were two cogent reasons for ratifying the treaty despite its\r\ndefects: it provided for indemnity in respect to recent seizures on the\r\nhigh seas; and it averted war. But no arguments could justify the\r\nsurrender of American trade in the West Indies, to the minds of either\r\nthe New England shipper or the Southern planter, for while the latter\r\nmight be indifferent to other considerations, he would not willingly\r\npart with his right to ship his cotton crop, now becoming every year\r\nmore valuable. The requisite two-thirds vote of the Senate was secured\r\nonly by dropping out altogether the objectionable twelfth article.\r\n\r\nThe publication of the treaty was followed by an outburst of popular\r\nindignation which made even the President wince. Remonstrances and\r\nprotests poured in upon him from every part of the Union. The sailors\r\nand shipowners of Portsmouth burned Jay and Grenville in effigy,\r\ntogether with a miniature ship of seventy tons. In Charleston, the flags\r\nwere put at half-mast and the public hangman burned copies of the treaty\r\nin the open street. While remonstrating with a disorderly crowd in Wall\r\nStreet which was vilifying Jay, Hamilton was stoned and forced to give\r\nway with the blood streaming down his face. Personal abuse of the\r\ncoarsest kind was heaped upon Washington by the opposition press, while\r\na host of pamphleteers assailed him under cover of anonymity. Congress\r\nexpressed its hostility toward the President by omitting to congratulate\r\nhim on his birthday.\r\n\r\nIn the face of this denunciation, Washington might well have hesitated\r\nto press the ratification of the amended treaty upon Great Britain. His\r\nperplexities were further increased by the tidings that the Ministry\r\nhad renewed the earlier orders for the seizure of provisions on neutral\r\nvessels bound for French ports. Hamilton was of the opinion that the\r\nPresident should insist upon the withdrawal of this order in council and\r\nupon the acceptance of the Senate amendment before he ratified the\r\ntreaty. The delicate task of securing the consent of Great Britain to\r\nthese conditions was entrusted to John Quincy Adams, then Minister at\r\nThe Hague.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the skies cleared in the Northwest. Wayne's punitive\r\nexpedition had done its work. With their towns destroyed and their crops\r\nruined, the Indians had passed a terrible winter. By the following\r\nsummer they were ready to sue for peace. In a great council at\r\nGreenville, on August 4, 1795, they agreed to a treaty which ceded to\r\nthe United States all the region south and east of a line running from\r\nthe intersection of the Kentucky and Ohio Rivers to Lake Erie. Only one\r\nthing was needed to secure the Northwest and that was the evacuation of\r\nthe British posts.\r\n\r\nDuring this same summer, Thomas Pinckney, at the Court of Madrid, was\r\ntrying to secure the liberation of the Southwest from the control of\r\nSpain. On October 27, 1795, the treaty of San Lorenzo was signed, which\r\nconceded the thirty-first parallel as the northern boundary of West\r\nFlorida from the Mississippi to the Apalachicola. This was in itself a\r\nnotable achievement; but even more important to the people of the\r\nWestern world was the declaration that the Mississippi River should be\r\nopen to their commerce with the right of deposit at New Orleans.\r\n\r\nThe mission of Adams at the Court of St. James was not less successful.\r\nThe Ministry agreed to modify the objectionable order in council and to\r\naccept the treaty without the twelfth article. With a deep sense of\r\nrelief Washington promulgated the treaty as the law of the land on\r\nFebruary 27, 1795. With these three treaties of 1795, not only was war\r\naverted, but our slender hold upon the vast tract between the\r\nAlleghanies and the Mississippi immeasurably strengthened, if not\r\nsecured for all time.\r\n\r\n\r\n     BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\r\n\r\n     The attitude of historical writers toward the events recorded in\r\n     this chapter has been considerably altered since the publication\r\n     of a series of articles by F. J. Turner. The more important of\r\n     these contributions are: \"The Origin of Genet's Projected Attack\r\n     on Louisiana and the Floridas\" (_American Historical Review_,\r\n     III); \"The Policy of France toward the Mississippi Valley\"\r\n     (_Ibid._, X); and \"The Diplomatic Contest for the Mississippi\r\n     Valley\" (_Atlantic Monthly_, XCIII). Nearly all the authorities\r\n     cited in the foregoing chapter deal in greater or less detail with\r\n     the diplomatic events of Washington's Administrations. The\r\n     following may be added to the list: Trescott, _Diplomatic History\r\n     of the Administrations of Washington and Adams_ (1857); F. A. Ogg,\r\n     _The Opening of the Mississippi_ (1904); C. D. Hazen,\r\n     _Contemporary American Opinion of the French Revolution_ (1897).\r\n     The story of the expeditions against the Indians of the Northwest\r\n     is told by Roosevelt, _Winning of the West_ (vol. IV). A reliable\r\n     account of the Whiskey Insurrection is given in Brackenridge,\r\n     _History of the Western Insurrection_ (1859).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nANGLOMEN AND JACOBINS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn January, 1795, Hamilton retired from the Treasury Department. The\r\nmoment was well chosen, for his great creative work was done and signs\r\nwere not wanting that the initiative in finance was about to pass to the\r\nHouse of Representatives. As he passed out of office, a young\r\nRepresentative from Pennsylvania made his appearance in Congress who was\r\nscarcely his inferior in quick grasp of the intricacies of public\r\nfinance. Almost the first efforts of Albert Gallatin were directed to\r\nthe improvement of the methods of congressional finance. It was at his\r\nsuggestion that the first standing Committee of Ways and Means in the\r\nHouse was appointed, in the expectation that it would assume a general\r\nsuperintendence of finance. Believing that the Executive could be held\r\nin check only by systematic, specific appropriations, Gallatin became an\r\ninsistent advocate of the rule, and in consequence a thorn in the flesh\r\nof the departments. \"The management of the Treasury,\" complained Wolcott\r\nto Hamilton, \"becomes more and more difficult. The legislature will not\r\npass laws in gross. Their appropriations are minute; Gallatin, to whom\r\nthey yield, is evidently intending to break down this department, by\r\ncharging it with an impracticable detail.\" \"The heads of departments,\"\r\nFisher Ames wrote despondently, two years after Hamilton left office,\r\n\"are chief clerks. Instead of being the ministry, the organs of the\r\nexecutive power, and imparting a kind of momentum to the operation of\r\nthe laws, they are precluded even from communicating with the House by\r\nreports.\" There was no room for a British ministry in the Republican\r\nscheme of politics.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Washington's foreign policy had widened the breach between the\r\npolitical factions and had forced him into a partisan position. From the\r\nRepublican point of view, Jay's treaty threw the United States into the\r\narms of England and gave just cause of offense to France. Knowing the\r\npopular temper, which was undoubtedly hostile to the treaty, the\r\nRepublican leaders endeavored to defeat the purposes of the\r\nAdministration by refusing to vote the necessary appropriations. Their\r\nfirst demand was for the papers relating to the treaty, on the ground\r\nthat in matters upon which the action of the House was needed, that body\r\nmight properly call for information to guide its deliberations. The\r\nPresident refused this demand, both because he deemed it imprudent to\r\nmake the papers public, and because he denied the right of the House to\r\nparticipate in the treaty-making power.\r\n\r\nThe debate which followed is one of the most illuminating in the early\r\nhistory of Congress. The trend of argument may be suggested by two\r\nremarks of opposing partisans. Said Griswold for the Federalists, \"The\r\nHouse of Representatives have nothing to do with the treaty but provide\r\nfor its execution.\" Disclaiming that the House was bent upon impairing\r\nthe constitutional right of the President and Senate to make treaties,\r\nGallatin contended that the power claimed by the House was \"only a\r\nnegative, a restraining power on those subjects over which Congress has\r\nthe right to legislate.\" In vigorous resolutions the House sustained\r\nGallatin's position; and the appropriation for the treaty was carried\r\nonly by the casting vote of the Speaker, on April 29, two months after\r\nWashington by proclamation had declared the treaty to be the law of the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of the _rapprochement_ between the United States and\r\nGreat Britain were far-reaching. The French Minister, Fauchet, urged his\r\nGovernment to take immediate steps to acquire a continental colony which\r\nwould not only serve France and her West India colonies as a granary and\r\nas a market for their exports, but which would also bring pressure to\r\nbear upon the disaffected border communities of the United States. Such\r\na colony was Louisiana. With this province in her possession, a power\r\nlike France would speedily control the Mississippi and the Western\r\npeople who used that highway for their commerce. Throughout the year\r\n1795, the French Government sought by persuasion and threats to secure\r\nLouisiana from Spain as the price of an alliance.\r\n\r\nHow far the Administration was apprised of these designs is not clear;\r\nbut against the background of French intrigue certain passages of\r\nWashington's Farewell Address take on a new significance. The West was\r\nwarned that it could control \"the indispensable outlets for its own\r\nproductions\" only by attaching itself firmly to \"the Atlantic side of\r\nthe Union.\" \"Any other tenure ... whether derived from its own separate\r\nstrength, or from an apostate and unnatural connection with any foreign\r\npower, must be intrinsically precarious.\" And the admission of Tennessee\r\nas a State in the year 1796 may have been hastened by an ill-defined\r\nfear that the people of the West might not be proof against French\r\nmachinations.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of Washington not to accept a re-election was known to his\r\nintimates early in the spring of 1796. Upon whom would his mantle fall?\r\nThere was much searching of hearts among Federalist leaders, but by the\r\nend of the summer it was well understood that Federalist electors would\r\nsupport John Adams and Thomas Pinckney for the Presidency and\r\nVice-Presidency. The most talented man in the party was unquestionably\r\nAlexander Hamilton; but Hamilton had made too many enemies to be a\r\npopular candidate. By common consent, Thomas Jefferson became the\r\ncandidate of the Republicans for President; with him was associated\r\nAaron Burr, of New York.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable aspect of the campaign of 1796 was the undisguised\r\nattempt of Adet, who had succeeded Fauchet, to turn the election in\r\nJefferson's favor. The treaty with England could not be undone; but\r\nFrance had much to hope from a Republican administration. In a series of\r\nletters directed to the Secretary of State, but printed in the\r\nPhiladelphia _Aurora_, Adet announced that the Directory regarded the\r\ntreaty of commerce concluded with Great Britain as \"a violation of the\r\ntreaty made with France in 1778, and equivalent to a treaty of alliance\r\nwith Great Britain.\" \"Justly offended,\" the Directory had ordered him to\r\n\"suspend his ministerial functions with the Federal Government.\" This\r\naction, however, was not to be regarded as a rupture between the two\r\npeoples, but only \"as a mark of just discontent, which is to last until\r\nthe Government of the United States returns to sentiments and to\r\nmeasures, more conformable to the interests of the alliance, and the\r\nsworn friendship between the two nations.\"\r\n\r\nAdet would have had the people believe that the alternatives were\r\nJefferson or war; and the threat of war, so it was said, was enough to\r\ndrive the peace-loving Quakers of Pennsylvania into the Republican\r\nranks. In more northerly States Adet's manifesto probably had the\r\nopposite effect. \"There is not one elector east of the Delaware River,\"\r\ndeclared the Connecticut _Courant_, \"who would not sooner be shot than\r\nvote for Thomas Jefferson.\" Not a Republican elector was chosen in the\r\nStates to the north and east of Pennsylvania. On the other hand, Adams\r\nreceived only two electoral votes south of the Potomac. South Carolina\r\ndivided its vote between Jefferson and Pinckney. Only unexpected votes\r\nin Virginia and North Carolina gave Adams the election, for Pennsylvania\r\nwas carried by the Republicans. Pinckney lost the Vice-Presidency\r\nthrough the defection of Federalists in New England.\r\n\r\nAn incident of the election in Pennsylvania revealed the change already\r\nwrought by parties in the Constitution. The framers of the Constitution\r\nexpected that a small number of persons selected by their fellow\r\ncitizens from the general mass would deliberately weigh \"all the reasons\r\nand inducements which were proper to govern their choice,\" and in their\r\nmature wisdom choose the individual who met the requirements of the\r\noffice. It fell out otherwise. In Pennsylvania, one of the six States to\r\nchoose electors by popular vote, each party had put forward a ticket\r\nwith fifteen names. Thirteen of the fifteen Republican electors were\r\nchosen. Of the two Federalist electors who were chosen, one broke faith\r\nwith his party and cast his vote for Jefferson and Pinckney. The\r\nFederalists were exasperated by this treachery. \"What!\" expostulated a\r\nwriter in the _United States Gazette_: \"Do I chuse Samuel Miles to\r\ndetermine for me whether John Adams or Thomas Jefferson shall be\r\nPresident? No! I chuse him to _act_, not to _think_.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Adet was endeavoring to bring what the Federalists called the\r\nFrench party into power, the Administration was urging the reluctant\r\nMonroe at Paris to make the Jay Treaty as palatable as possible to the\r\nFrench Government. This was an irksome task for that ardent Republican.\r\nFrom the outset of his mission he found it difficult to sustain that\r\ndetachment from French politics which his position demanded. Moreover,\r\nafter having assured the French Government that Jay was negotiating at\r\nLondon only for the redress of grievances and not for a commercial\r\ntreaty, Monroe found it peculiarly humiliating to be obliged to confess\r\nthat he had been kept in ignorance of the real trend of negotiations.\r\nUnder these circumstances, he temporized and gave only half-hearted\r\nattention to the task of placating the Directory. Hamilton now advised\r\nhis recall; and Washington, who had on two occasions expressed his\r\ndispleasure with Monroe's conduct, determined to send Charles Cotesworth\r\nPinckney in his stead.\r\n\r\nTrivial as this incident seems, it was not without its effect upon the\r\ncourse of diplomacy abroad and of politics at home. When Monroe\r\nendeavored to put his successor into touch with the French Foreign\r\nOffice, he was told that the Directory was not prepared to receive\r\nanother American representative until their grievances had been\r\nredressed. This affront left Pinckney in an embarrassing position, for\r\nuntil his credentials were accepted, he was liable, like all foreigners\r\nat that time, to arrest as a spy. It was not until February, after many\r\nmonths of waiting, that he was given his passport. He at once crossed\r\nthe border and took up his residence at Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Monroe had taken his departure with the warmest expressions of\r\nregard on the part of the French Government. He was assured that his\r\nworth and his efforts in behalf of his country's interests were\r\nunderstood and appreciated. He returned to the United States with the\r\nfirm conviction, which his Republican friends shared, that he had been\r\nmade the victim of Federalist chicanery. In the following year he\r\npublished an elaborate defense which served admirably as a popular\r\ncampaign document in the next presidential elections.\r\n\r\nIt fell to John Adams on the very threshold of his administration to\r\ndeal with what he euphemistically called the misunderstanding with\r\nFrance. His inaugural address announced unmistakably his intention to\r\npreserve neutrality between the belligerents of Europe, and to treat\r\nFrance with impartiality but with a sincere desire for her friendship.\r\nBetween the lines may be read also an equally sincere desire to placate\r\nthe opposition and to free himself from all imputation of a bias toward\r\nGreat Britain and a monarchical system. From the first news of\r\nPinckney's dismissal, President Adams was disposed \"to institute a fresh\r\nattempt at negotiation\": he even approached Jefferson to see if he would\r\nnot persuade Madison to serve on a special commission, believing that\r\nMadison's well-known Gallic sympathies would commend him to the French\r\nnation. At the same time he declared stoutly in a message to Congress,\r\nin special session on May 15, that France had treated the United States\r\n\"neither as allies nor as friends nor as a sovereign state.\" Attempts\r\nwhich had been made to create a rupture between the people of the United\r\nStates and their Government \"ought to be repelled with a decision which\r\nshall convince France and the world that we are not a degraded people\r\nhumiliated under a colonial spirit of fear and sense of inferiority.\"\r\nWhile he therefore recommended measures of defense, he asked the Senate\r\nto confirm the appointment of three commissioners whom he proposed to\r\nsend to France. Two of these, Pinckney and John Marshall, were\r\nFederalists, but the third was Elbridge Gerry, a Massachusetts\r\nRepublican, who was the second choice of the President, Dana having\r\ndeclined to serve.\r\n\r\nWhile Congress was acting upon the President's recommendations and\r\nvoting appropriations for fortifications and for the completion of the\r\nthree frigates which were then on the stocks, disquieting disclosures\r\ncame from the West. Spain having declared war upon England in the\r\nprevious fall, British emissaries, it was rumored, were concerting plans\r\nfor the conquest of New Orleans and West Florida. While expeditions made\r\nup of Western frontiersmen and Indians descended upon the Spanish\r\nstrongholds in the Southwest, a British fleet was to blockade the mouth\r\nof the Mississippi. The evidence which President Adams laid before\r\nCongress in July implicated Senator Blount, of Tennessee. In common with\r\nother land speculators, he had become alarmed at the rumor that France\r\nwas about to acquire Louisiana, and had agreed to use his influence\r\namong the whites and Indians of the Southwest, where he had formerly\r\nbeen governor, to assist the designs of Great Britain. He was expelled\r\nfrom the Senate and impeached. Before his trial could take place, he was\r\nelected a member of the legislature of Tennessee, and from that point of\r\nvantage he successfully defied the federal authorities.\r\n\r\nThe episode had unfortunate consequences: it aroused the distrust of the\r\nSpanish Government and delayed the surrender of Natchez and other posts\r\nwhich Spain had agreed to cede in the Treaty of 1795; and it furnished\r\nTalleyrand, who had become Minister of Foreign Affairs under the\r\nDirectory, with an additional argument for the cession of Louisiana to\r\nFrance. France in control of Louisiana and Florida would be \"a wall of\r\nbrass forever impenetrable to the combined efforts of England and\r\nAmerica.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in March, 1797, dispatches arrived from the envoys which were full\r\nof sinister disclosures. On the 19th, President Adams announced gloomily\r\nthat he perceived \"no ground of expectation\" that the objects of the\r\nmission could be accomplished \"on terms compatible with the safety,\r\nhonor, or the essential interests of the nation.\" He renewed his\r\nrecommendations of measures of defense \"proportioned to the danger.\" The\r\naverage Republican regarded this message as tantamount to a declaration\r\nof war. Jefferson spoke of it as \"an insane message.\" The partisan press\r\nheld it to be further proof of British bias in John Adams, the old\r\naristocrat! But when the President sent to Congress the deciphered\r\ndispatches, and the newspapers had printed extracts from them, a wave of\r\nindignation swept over the country. For the moment the wildest partisan\r\nof France was silenced.\r\n\r\nThe envoys told a sordid tale of French intrigue and greed. It appeared\r\nthat they had never been received officially when they made known their\r\npresence on French soil, but had been approached by agents of\r\nTalleyrand, whom they referred to in the dispatches as Mr. X, Mr. Y, and\r\nMr. Z. They were much mystified by the language used by these gentlemen,\r\nuntil the evening of October 18, when Mr. X called on General Pinckney\r\nand whispered that he had a message from Talleyrand. \"General Pinckney\r\nsaid he should be glad to hear it. Mr. X replied that the Directory, and\r\nparticularly two of the members of it, were exceedingly irritated at\r\nsome passages of the President's speech, and desired that they should be\r\nsoftened; and that this step would be necessary previous to our\r\nreception. That, besides this, a sum of money was required for the\r\npocket of the Directory and Ministers, which would be at the disposal of\r\nM. Talleyrand; and that a loan would also be insisted on. Mr. X said if\r\nwe acceded to these measures, M. Talleyrand had no doubt that all our\r\ndifferences with France might be accommodated. On inquiry, Mr. X could\r\nnot point out the particular passages of the speech that had given\r\noffense, nor the quantum of the loan, but mentioned that the _douceur_\r\nfor the pocket was twelve hundred thousand livres, about fifty thousand\r\npounds sterling.\"\r\n\r\nUnwilling to believe their ears, the astonished envoys asked to have\r\nthese proposals put in writing. Mr. X not only complied with this\r\nrequest, but brought with him Mr. Y, a confidential friend of\r\nTalleyrand, who repeated the terms upon which the envoys would be\r\nreceived, and pointed out convenient means by which the money could be\r\nsecretly transferred.\r\n\r\nThe American commissioners responded that while they had ample powers to\r\nmake a treaty, they had none to make a loan. They offered, however, to\r\nsend one of their number to America for further instructions, provided\r\nthat the Directory would check the further capture of American vessels.\r\nNevertheless, the efforts of X and Y to secure the _douceur_ were not\r\nrelaxed. Finally, finding the envoys either obstinate or obtuse, Mr. X\r\nexclaimed, \"Gentlemen, you do not speak to the point. It is money; it is\r\nexpected that you will offer money.\" The Americans were inexorable.\r\n\"What is your answer?\" asked X impatiently. \"It is,\" said the envoys,\r\n\"no, no; not a sixpence.\"\r\n\r\nOn November 1, the commissioners agreed to hold no more indirect\r\nintercourse with the Government, but to prepare a statement of the\r\nAmerican grievances against France and to send it to Talleyrand. Two\r\nweary months passed before they received his answer. Couched in language\r\nwhich was both contemptuous and insulting, this reply of Talleyrand\r\nterminated the mission. The Directory intimated that in future they\r\nwould treat only with Gerry as \"the more impartial\" member of the\r\ncommission. Pinckney and Marshall remonstrated against this\r\ndiscrimination, but Gerry unwisely consented to deal with Talleyrand\r\nalone. Marshall secured a passport with some difficulty and departed for\r\nhome. Pinckney with more difficulty secured permission to retire to\r\nsouthern France with his invalid daughter.\r\n\r\nThe war spirit now ran high. President Adams declared that he would\r\nnever send another minister to France without assurances that he would\r\nbe \"received, respected, and honored as the representative of a great,\r\nfree, powerful, and independent nation,\" and the people supported this\r\ndeclaration with surprising unanimity. Demonstrations occurred in all\r\nthe playhouses of Philadelphia and New York; young men formed\r\nassociations and donned the black cockade as an emblem of patriotic\r\ndevotion; even in the quiet towns of New England, women met to drink tea\r\nand to sing the new song \"Adams and Liberty.\" Cities along the coast\r\nvied with one another in their eagerness to build warships. The\r\npatriotic fervor found expression in original song and verse. \"Hail\r\nColumbia\" was the happy inspiration of young Joseph Hopkinson, of\r\nPhiladelphia. For once in his life President John Adams found himself a\r\npopular hero riding on the crest of public applause.\r\n\r\nTo the intense disgust of Jefferson, even Republicans caught the war\r\nfever, and joined with the Federalists in putting the country on a war\r\nfooting. Among the earliest measures of Congress was an act providing\r\nfor the establishment of a Navy Department. In rapid succession followed\r\nacts authorizing the President to permit merchantmen to arm in their own\r\ndefense and our warships to seize French vessels which preyed upon our\r\ncommerce. On July 7, the existing treaties with France were repealed. In\r\nshort, without a formal declaration, the United States was virtually at\r\nwar with France. The new navy soon put to sea and gratified national\r\npride by several gallant victories, the most notable being the capture\r\nof the frigate L'Insurgente by the newly commissioned Constellation, on\r\nFebruary 9, 1799. When peace was restored in 1800, the navy had a record\r\nof eighty-four prizes, most of which were French privateers.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the provisional army did not move so rapidly, partly\r\nbecause of the incompetence of the Secretary of War, and partly because\r\nof an unseemly wrangle for precedence among the three major-generals\r\nwhom Adams had named. Conscious of his own inexperience in military\r\naffairs, President Adams had persuaded Washington to take chief command\r\nof the army with the distinct understanding that he would not be called\r\ninto active service unless an emergency arose. Washington named\r\nHamilton, C. C. Pinckney, and Knox as major-generals, and the President\r\nsent the nominations to the Senate in this order. Misunderstandings\r\narose at once as to the relative rank of these three major-generals.\r\nHamilton and his intimates in the circle of the President's advisers\r\nurged that as his name was first on the list he was the ranking officer.\r\nAt this Knox took umbrage, for he had outranked Hamilton in the old\r\narmy; and so, too, had Pinckney. Knowing the intrigue in Hamilton's\r\nbehalf and not a little alarmed at the prospect of having the direction\r\nof the war pass into the hands of a man whom he regarded as a rival,\r\nAdams determined to sign the commissions in the reverse order, thus\r\ngiving Knox precedence. The friends of Hamilton were enraged at this\r\nturn of affairs and prevailed upon Washington to write a letter of\r\nprotest to the President. Adams was finally persuaded to date all three\r\ncommissions alike and to leave the designation of rank to the\r\ncommander-in-chief. Washington promptly named Hamilton as\r\ninspector-general with precedence over Pinckney and Knox; whereupon Knox\r\nrefused to serve.\r\n\r\nThe immediate outcome of this controversy was to widen the rift which\r\nwas already separating the President from the faction led by Hamilton.\r\nAdams had taken office in the belief that Washington's cabinet advisers\r\nwere loyal to him. \"Pickering and all his colleagues are as much\r\nattached to me as I desire,\" he had written just before his\r\ninauguration. But he speedily found that all were accustomed to look to\r\nHamilton as the virtual leader of the Federalist party. Moreover, he\r\nfound himself thrust into the background in the matter of military\r\nappointments, as soon as Hamilton took over the actual work of\r\norganizing the army. The Constitution made him commander-in-chief;\r\ncircumstances seemed to conspire, he complained bitterly, \"to annihilate\r\nthe essential powers given to the President.\" He had, too, all the\r\nnatural aversion of a civilian for military affairs. \"Regiments are\r\ncostly articles everywhere,\" he told McHenry testily, \"and more so in\r\nthis country than in any other under the sun. And if this country sees a\r\ngreat army to maintain, without an enemy to fight, there may arise an\r\nenthusiasm that seems to be little foreseen.\"\r\n\r\nIt would have been strange, indeed, if under these circumstances the\r\nPresident had not scanned the horizon anxiously for the faintest\r\nintimations of peace. In October, 1798, definite assurances were given\r\nby Talleyrand, through our Minister at The Hague, that France would\r\nreceive a new minister from the United States. On February 18, 1799, the\r\nPresident confounded both friends and foes by sending to the Senate the\r\nnomination of Vans Murray to be Minister to France. The emotions of the\r\nmilitant Federalists were too various to admit of description. It would\r\nhave been madness, however, not to accept the proffered olive branch.\r\nSwallowing their wrath, they agreed to the mission, but substituted a\r\ncommission of three for a single minister.\r\n\r\nFrom Napoleon, the new master of France, the commissioners secured a\r\nconvention which not only restored peace, but safeguarded the rights of\r\nneutrals, by restraining the right of search and conceding the principle\r\nthat free ships make free goods. Napoleon consented also to the\r\nabrogation of the treaties of 1778, but only upon condition that the new\r\ntreaty should contain no provision for the settlement of claims for\r\nindemnity. John Adams was not far from the truth when he accounted this\r\npeace one of the most meritorious actions of his life. \"I desire no\r\nother inscription over my gravestone,\" he wrote fifteen years later,\r\n\"than: 'Here lies John Adams, who took upon himself the responsibility\r\nof the peace with France in the year 1800.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\r\n\r\n     On the origin and growth of political parties in the United\r\n     States, the following books are suggestive and informing: H. J.\r\n     Ford, _The Rise and Growth of American Politics_ (1898); C. E.\r\n     Merriam, _A History of American Political Theories_ (1910); J. P.\r\n     Gordy, _Political History of the United States_ (2 vols.,\r\n     1900-03); A. E. Morse, _The Federalist Party in Massachusetts to\r\n     the Year 1800_ (1909); J. D. Hammond, _History of the Political\r\n     Parties in the State of New York, 1789-1840_ (2 vols., 1850). To\r\n     those histories already mentioned which describe the quarrel with\r\n     France may be added G. W. Allen, _Our Naval War with France_\r\n     (1909), and A. T. Mahan, _Influence of Sea Power on the French\r\n     Revolution and Empire_ (2 vols., 1898). A most readable account of\r\n     manners and customs in America is given by La\r\n     Rochefoucauld-Liancourt, _Travels through the United States,\r\n     1795-1797_ (2 vols., 1799). Social life in New York and\r\n     Philadelphia is described by R. W. Griswold, _The Republican\r\n     Court_ (1864).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLUTION OF 1800\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greatest obstacle in the path of the people of the United States in\r\ntheir struggle toward national life was the vastness of the territory\r\nwhich they occupied. Even the region between the Alleghanies and the sea\r\nwas as yet imperfectly subdued. Great tracts of wilderness separated\r\ncommunities beyond the fall-line of the rivers. Intercourse was\r\nincredibly difficult even between the commercial ports of New England\r\nand the Middle States. Stage-coaches plied between Boston and New York,\r\nto be sure, and between New York and Philadelphia. By stage, too, a\r\ntraveler could reach Baltimore and Washington in the course of time. But\r\nbeyond the Potomac public conveyances were few and uncertain in their\r\nroutes. The only public stage in the Carolinas and Georgia plied between\r\nCharleston and Savannah. Those whom either public or private business\r\nforced to journey from these remote Southern States to Philadelphia took\r\npassage in coasting vessels. It is difficult to say which were greater,\r\nthe perils by land or by sea. Writing from Philadelphia in 1790, William\r\nSmith, of South Carolina, described the misfortunes of his fellow\r\nCongressmen in trying to reach the seat of government, as follows:\r\n\"Burke was shipwrecked off the Capes; Jackson and Mathews with great\r\ndifficulty landed at Cape May and traveled one hundred and sixty miles\r\nin a wagon to the city. Burke got here in the same way. Gerry and\r\nPartridge were overset in the stage; the first had his head broke and\r\nmade his _entree_ with an enormous black patch; the other had his ribs\r\nsadly bruised and was unable to stir for some days. Tucker had a\r\ndreadful passage of sixteen days with perpetual storms. I wish these\r\nlittle _contretemps_ may not sour their tempers and be inauspicious to\r\nour proceedings.\"\r\n\r\nEven in the North, where distances were not so great and where great\r\narms of the ocean did not penetrate so far inland, as in North Carolina,\r\nfor example, interposing so many barriers to communication, travel was\r\npainfully slow and hazardous. Travelers who made the journey from Boston\r\nto New York by stage-coach accounted themselves lucky if they reached\r\ntheir destination in six days, for no bridges spanned any of the great\r\nwaterways and the crossing by ferryboats was uncertain and often\r\ndangerous. Many travelers preferred to journey by water from port to\r\nport, but coasting vessels, contending with the winds and the tides,\r\nwere often nine or ten days in sailing from Boston to New York.\r\n\r\nThe post traveled with somewhat greater speed; yet a letter sent from\r\nPortland, Maine, could not be delivered in Savannah, Georgia, in less\r\nthan twenty days. From Philadelphia a post went to Lexington, Kentucky,\r\nin sixteen days, and to Nashville, Tennessee, in twenty-two days. The\r\ncost of these posts, like the cost of traveling, was in many cases\r\nprohibitive. The rate for a letter of a single sheet was twenty-five\r\ncents. News traveled slowly from State to State. The best news sheets\r\nin New York printed intelligence from Virginia which was almost as\r\nbelated as that which the packets brought from Europe.\r\n\r\nWith such barriers in the way of intercourse, the masses, so far indeed\r\nas they possessed the suffrage at all, were not politically\r\nself-assertive. Devoted primarily to the pursuit of agriculture and\r\ncommerce, essentially rural in their distribution, the people had\r\nneither the desire nor the means, nor yet the leisure, to engage in\r\nactive politics. Politics was the occupation of those who commanded\r\nleisure and some accumulated wealth. The voters of the several States\r\ntouched each other only through their leaders. In these early years\r\nnational parties were hardly more than divisions of a governing class.\r\nParty organization was visible only in its most rudimentary form--a\r\nleader and a personal following. The machinery of a modern party\r\norganization did not come into existence until the railroad and the\r\nsteamboat tightened the bonds of intercourse between State and State,\r\nand between community and community.\r\n\r\nIn another respect political parties of the Federalist period differed\r\nfrom later political organizations. Under stress of foreign\r\ncomplications, Federalists and Republicans were forced into an\r\nirreconcilable antagonism. The one group was thought to be British in\r\nits sympathies, the other Gallic. In the eyes of his opponents, the\r\nRepublican was no better than a democrat, a Jacobin, a revolutionary\r\nincendiary; and the Federalist no better than a monocrat and a Tory. The\r\neffect was denationalizing. Each lost confidence in the other's\r\nAmericanism.\r\n\r\nThe Federalists, in control of the Executive,--and thus, in the common\r\nphrase, \"in power,\"--were disposed to view the opposition as factious,\r\nif not treasonable. Washington deprecated the spirit of party and\r\nthought it ought not to be tolerated in a popular government. Fisher\r\nAmes expressed a common Federalist conviction when he wrote in 1796: \"It\r\nis a childish comfort that many enjoy, who say the minority aim at place\r\nonly, not at the overthrow of government. They aim at setting mobs above\r\nlaw, not at the filling places which have known legal responsibility.\r\nThe struggle against them is therefore _pro aris et focis_; it is for\r\nour rights and liberties.\" Such a state of mind can be understood only\r\nby a diligent reading of the newspapers and political tracts of the\r\ntime. Republican journalists, many of whom were of alien origin, still\r\ngloried in the ideals and achievements of the French Revolution. But\r\nliberty and democracy, as preached by a Tom Paine and glorified by a\r\nCallender and exemplified by the Reign of Terror in France, had caused\r\nan ominous reaction in the minds of upholders of the established order\r\nin the United States.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, when, in the minds of those in authority,\r\nparty was identified with faction, and faction was held to be synonymous\r\nwith treason, the position of the Republicans was precarious. War with\r\nFrance they bitterly opposed, but were powerless to prevent. The path of\r\nopposition was made all the more difficult by the well-known attitude of\r\nconspicuous Federalist leaders who favored war as an opportunity for\r\ndiscrediting their political opponents, or, as Higginson expressed it,\r\nfor closing the \"avenues of French poison and intrigue.\"\r\n\r\nLaboring under the conviction that they had to deal not only with an\r\nenemy without but with an insidious foe within, the Federalists carried\r\nthrough Congress in June and July, 1798, a series of measures which are\r\nusually cited as the Alien and Sedition Acts. The first in the series\r\nwas the Naturalization Act, which lengthened the period of residence\r\nrequired of aliens who desired citizenship, from five to fourteen years.\r\nThe Alien Act authorized the President, for a period of two years, to\r\norder out of the country all such aliens as he deemed dangerous to\r\npublic safety or guilty of treasonable designs against the Government.\r\nFailure to leave the country after due warning was made punishable by\r\nimprisonment for a term not exceeding three years and by exclusion from\r\ncitizenship for all time. A third act conferred upon the President the\r\nfurther discretionary power to remove alien enemies in time of war or of\r\nthreatened war. Finally, the Sedition Act added to the crimes punishable\r\nby the federal courts unlawful conspiracy and the publication of \"any\r\nfalse, scandalous, and malicious writings\" against the Government,\r\nPresident, or Congress, with the intent to defame them or to bring them\r\ninto contempt or disrepute. For conspiracy the penalty was a fine not\r\nexceeding five thousand dollars and imprisonment not exceeding five\r\nyears; for seditious libel, a fine not exceeding two thousand dollars\r\nand imprisonment not exceeding two years.\r\n\r\nThe debates in Congress left little doubt that the Sedition Act was a\r\nweapon forged for partisan purposes. The Federalists were convinced that\r\nFrance maintained a party in America which by means of corrupt hirelings\r\nand subsidized presses was paralyzing the efforts of the Administration\r\nto defend national rights. That there was great provocation for the act\r\ncannot be denied. The tone of the press generally was low; but between\r\nthe scurrilous assaults of Cobbett in _Porcupine's Gazette_ upon\r\nRepublican leaders, and the atrocious libels of Bache upon President\r\nWashington, there is not much to choose.\r\n\r\nWhat the opposition had to fear from the Sedition Act, appeared with\r\nstartling suddenness in October, 1798, when Representative Matthew Lyon,\r\nof Vermont, an eccentric character who had become the butt of all\r\nFederalists, was indicted for publishing a letter in which he maintained\r\nthat under President Adams \"every consideration of the public welfare\r\nwas swallowed up in a continual grasp for power, in an unbounded thirst\r\nfor ridiculous pomp, foolish adulation, and selfish avarice.\" The\r\nunlucky Lyon was found guilty, sentenced to imprisonment for four\r\nmonths, and fined one thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nAlarmed by this attack on what he termed the freedom of speech and of\r\nthe press, Jefferson cast about for some effective form of protest.\r\nCollaborating with John Breckenridge, a member of the Kentucky\r\nLegislature, he prepared a series of resolutions which were adopted by\r\nthat body, while Madison, then a member of the Virginia House of\r\nBurgesses, secured the adoption of a set of resolutions of similar\r\npurport which he had drafted. Both sets of resolutions condemned the\r\nAlien and Sedition Acts as unwarranted by the letter of the Constitution\r\nand opposed to its spirit. Both reiterated the current theory of the\r\nUnion as a compact to which the States were parties; and both intimated\r\nthat, as in all other cases of compact among parties having no common\r\njudge, each party had an equal right to judge for itself, as well of\r\ninfractions as of the mode of redress.\r\n\r\nThe real purport of these Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions has been\r\nmuch misunderstood. The emphasis should fall not upon the compact\r\ntheory, for that was commonly accepted at this time; nor yet upon the\r\nvague remedies suggested by the phrases \"nullification\" and\r\n\"interposition.\" With these remedies Jefferson and Madison were not\r\ngreatly concerned. Protest rather than action was uppermost in their\r\nminds. As Jefferson said to Madison, they proposed to \"leave the matter\r\nin such a train as that we may not be committed absolutely to\r\nextremities, and yet may be free to push as far as events will render\r\nprudent.\" What they desired was such an affirmation of principles as\r\nshould rally their followers and arrest the usurpation of power by their\r\nopponents. The fundamental position assumed is that the Federal\r\nGovernment is one of limited powers and that citizens must look to their\r\nState Governments as bulwarks of their civil liberties, whenever the\r\nexpress terms of the federal compact are violated. The Federal\r\nGovernment was not to be allowed to become the judge of its own powers.\r\nBy recalling the party to its original position of opposition to the\r\nconsolidating tendencies of the Federalists, the resolutions of 1798\r\nserved much the same purpose as a modern party platform. In this light,\r\ntheir ambiguities are not greater nor their political theories more\r\nvague than those of later platforms.\r\n\r\nIn the early months of 1799, petitions for the repeal of the Alien and\r\nSedition Acts began to pour in upon Congress from the Middle States; but\r\nthe Federalists felt secure enough in popular favor to ignore these\r\nprotests. With a keener ear for the voice of the people, Jefferson\r\nsummoned his Republican friends to seize the moment to effect an entire\r\n\"revolution of the public mind to its republican soundness.\" \"This\r\nsummer is the season for systematic energies and sacrifices,\" he wrote\r\nto Madison. \"The engine is the press. Every man must lay his purse and\r\npen under contribution.\" The response was immediate and hearty. Not only\r\nwere political pamphlets printed and distributed from Cape Cod to the\r\nBlue Ridge, but an astonishing number of newspapers were founded to\r\ndisseminate Republican doctrine. The three or four years before the\r\npresidential election of 1800 are marked by an unprecedented\r\njournalistic revival. Instead of being mere purveyors of facts, these\r\nnewspapers became, as a contemporary observes, \"Vehicles of discussion,\r\nin which the principles of government, the interests of nations, the\r\nspirit and tendency of public measures, and the public and private\r\ncharacters of individuals, are all arraigned, tried, and decided.\" Such\r\na systematic attempt to direct public opinion had not been made since\r\nthe early days of the Revolution.\r\n\r\n[Map: Vote on the Repeal of the Alien and Sedition Acts House\r\nof Representatives February 25, 1799]\r\n\r\nThe Federalists watched this Republican revival with grave misgivings.\r\nWhat Jefferson called \"the awakening of the spirit of 1776\" was to\r\nFisher Ames an ominous sign of impending \"revolutionary Robespierrism.\"\r\nFederalists of the Hamiltonian brand unhesitatingly held the Republicans\r\nresponsible for the Fries Rebellion, which occurred in Pennsylvania. The\r\nimmediate occasion for these disturbances, to be sure, was the federal\r\nhouse tax, but the rioting occurred in those eastern counties which were\r\nardently Republican; hence the outbreak could be denounced plausibly\r\nenough as the result of Jacobin teachings. In some alarm the\r\nAdministration dispatched troops to quell the riots, and prosecuted the\r\nleaders with relentless vigor. Fries was condemned to death, and the\r\nPresident's advisers would have carried out the decree of the court, \"to\r\ninspire the malevolent and factious with terror\"; but President Adams\r\npersisted in pardoning Fries, holding wisely that there was grave danger\r\nin so construing treason as to apply it to \"every sudden, ignorant,\r\ninconsiderable heat, among a part of the people, wrought up by political\r\ndisputes, and personal and party animosities.\" Such motives were not\r\nappreciated by the circle of Hamilton's admirers. Why were the renegade\r\naliens who were running the incendiary presses not sent out of the\r\ncountry, Hamilton asked Pickering. \"Are laws of this kind passed merely\r\nto excite odium and remain a dead letter?\"\r\n\r\nIf the Administration made only a half-hearted effort to arrest and\r\ndeport aliens, it could at least not be accused of letting the Sedition\r\nAct remain a dead letter. Some unnecessary and thoroughly unwise\r\nprosecutions in the year 1799 were followed by a series of trials for\r\nseditious libel in the spring term of the federal courts. All the\r\nindividuals indicted were either editors or printers of Republican\r\nnewspapers. The impression created by these prosecutions was, therefore,\r\nthat the Administration had determined to crush the opposition. What\r\ndeepened this impression was the obvious bias of the federal judges and\r\nthe partisanship of the juries, which it was alleged were packed by the\r\nprosecution.\r\n\r\nWith one accord Republican editors lifted up their voices in defense of\r\nfreedom of speech, never losing from view, however, the political\r\npossibilities of the situation. The more prosecutions the better, wrote\r\none editor significantly to a fellow victim: \"You know the old\r\necclesiastical observation that the blood of the martyrs was the seed of\r\nthe church.\" From the Federalist point of view these editors were \"lying\r\nJacobins,\" incendiaries, anarchists. \"Should Jacobinism gain the\r\nascendency,\" an orator at Deerfield, Massachusetts, warned his auditors,\r\nin the midst of the elections of 1800, \"let every man arm himself, not\r\nonly to defend his property, his wife, and children, but to secure his\r\nlife from the dagger of his Jacobin neighbor.\" In vain Republicans\r\nprotested that they had a right to form a party to oppose measures which\r\nthey deemed destructive to public liberty. They were not opposing the\r\nConstitution but the Administration; not government in general, but the\r\nexisting Government, of men who were employing despotic methods.\r\n\r\nIn the presidential election of 1800 only four of the sixteen States\r\nprovided for a choice of the electors directly by the people. The\r\noutcome depended upon the action of the legislatures in a comparatively\r\nfew States. New England was so steadfast in the Federalist faith that\r\nthe Republicans gave up all hope of contesting the control of the\r\nlegislatures. After an electioneering tour through Connecticut, Aaron\r\nBurr is said to have remarked that they might as well attempt to\r\nrevolutionize the Kingdom of Heaven. On the other hand, Jeffersonian\r\nRepublicanism was deeply rooted in Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and\r\nGeorgia. The contestable area lay in the Middle States and in the\r\nCarolinas.\r\n\r\nIn the early spring, both parties began to burnish their armor for the\r\nfirst encounter in New York. It was generally believed that the May\r\nelections to the Assembly would determine the vote of the presidential\r\nelectors, and that the vote of the city of New York would settle the\r\ncontrol of the Assembly. The task of carrying the legislative districts\r\nof the city for the Republicans fell to Aaron Burr, past-master of the\r\nart of political management and first of the long line of political\r\nbosses of the great metropolis. How he concentrated the party vote upon\r\na ticket which bore such names as those of George Clinton, Horatio\r\nGates, and Henry Rutgers; how he wooed and won voters in the doubtful\r\nseventh ward among the laboring classes,--these are matters which elude\r\nthe most painstaking researches of the historian. The outcome was a\r\nRepublican Assembly which beyond a peradventure would give the\r\nelectoral vote of the State to the Republican candidates.\r\n\r\nIn another respect Burr's victory in New York was important. It made him\r\nthe logical and most available candidate for the vice-presidential\r\nnomination. By general consent Jefferson became for the second time the\r\ncandidate of his party for the Presidency. On May 11, the Republican\r\nmembers of Congress met in caucus and unanimously agreed to support Burr\r\nfor the Vice-Presidency. Already wiseacres were figuring out the\r\nprobabilities of a Republican victory.\r\n\r\nIt was a chastened group of Federalist Congressmen who met in caucus on\r\nMay 3, after the disheartening tidings from New York. Though their\r\nhearts misgave them, they still supported John Adams. To carry South\r\nCarolina, they agreed to support Charles C. Pinckney for the\r\nVice-Presidency; but rumor had it that many Federalists would be glad to\r\nsee Pinckney outstrip Adams,--a hope which in the course of the summer\r\nwas frankly avowed by Hamilton. In a letter which he had privately\r\nprinted for circulation among the Federalists, Hamilton declared without\r\ndisguise his hostility to Adams. The imprudence of this act was apparent\r\nwhen Burr seized upon a copy of the letter and scattered reprints far\r\nand wide as good campaign material.\r\n\r\n[Map: Presidential Election of 1800 Popular Vote by Counties]\r\n\r\nThe effect of Hamilton's indiscretion was probably slight. Adams carried\r\nall the electoral votes in the New England States, leading Pinckney by a\r\nsingle vote. The Federalists were completely successful also in New\r\nJersey and Delaware. Through the tactics of thirteen Federalists in\r\nthe Senate of Pennsylvania, they won seven of the fifteen electoral\r\nvotes of that State. In Maryland they divided the electoral vote evenly\r\nwith their opponents. In North Carolina, they secured four of the twelve\r\nvotes; but in South Carolina they were completely discomfited. Instead\r\nof carrying his own State for the ticket, Pinckney was outgeneraled by\r\nthe strategy of his cousin Charles Pinckney, who effected an\r\nirresistible combination of the Piedmont farmers and the artisans of\r\nCharleston. The loss of South Carolina was irretrievable and decisive.\r\nThe Federalists had to concede the defeat of their ticket.\r\n\r\nThe exultation of the Republicans was at first unbounded. \"The election\r\nof a Republican President,\" wrote the editor of the Schenectady\r\n_Cabinet_ triumphantly, \"is a new Declaration of Independence, as\r\nimportant in its consequences as that of '76, and of much more difficult\r\nachievement.\" But the elation of the Jeffersonians was somewhat tempered\r\nby the information that Jefferson and Burr had an equal number of votes\r\nin the electoral college. Adams was defeated, to be sure, but was Thomas\r\nJefferson elected? Neither Jefferson nor Burr had \"the highest number of\r\nvotes\" which the Constitution required for an election. The House of\r\nRepresentatives, therefore, must choose between them. But the House was\r\nFederalist! Coincidently with these tidings came rumors that the\r\nFederalists would prevent an election by the House until the 4th of\r\nMarch passed, when the Presidency and Vice-Presidency would fall vacant,\r\nnecessitating a new election. Scarcely less ominous was the report that\r\nthe Federalists would endeavor to seat Burr in the presidential chair.\r\n\r\nWhen balloting began in the House on February 11, 1801, enough\r\nFederalists had been involved in an intrigue to defeat Jefferson to give\r\nthe vote of six States to Burr. Jefferson received the vote of eight\r\nStates, but not the majority which was needed to elect, inasmuch as the\r\ndelegations of two States were evenly divided. The result was the same\r\non thirty-five successive ballots. On the thirty-sixth, February 17,\r\nJefferson received the votes of ten States and Burr of four. The votes\r\nof Delaware and South Carolina were blank, the Federalists having agreed\r\nto produce a tie by not voting. A similar abstention from voting on the\r\npart of Federalists from Vermont and Maryland gave the votes of those\r\nStates to Jefferson.\r\n\r\nMore than any other man, Bayard, of Delaware, was responsible for the\r\nelection of Jefferson. Finding that Burr would not \"commit himself,\"\r\nBayard announced that he would cast the single vote of his State for\r\nJefferson. \"You cannot well imagine the clamor and vehement invective to\r\nwhich I was subjected for some days,\" he wrote to Hamilton. \"We had\r\nseveral caucuses. All acknowledged that nothing but desperate measures\r\nremained, which several were disposed to adopt, and but few were willing\r\nopenly to disapprove. We broke up each time in confusion and discord,\r\nand the manner of the last ballot was arranged but a few minutes before\r\nthe ballot was taken.\" How narrowly the Federalists escaped the folly of\r\nelecting Burr may be inferred from the further statement of Bayard,\r\nthat \"the means existed of electing Burr, but this required his\r\ncooperation. By deceiving one man (a great blockhead), and tempting two\r\n(not incorruptible), he might have secured a majority of the States.\"\r\n\r\nIn after years Jefferson was wont to speak of his election as \"the\r\nRevolution of 1800.\" To his mind, it was \"as real a revolution in the\r\nprinciples of our government as that of 1776 was in its form; not\r\neffected, indeed, by the sword, as that, but by the rational and\r\npeaceable instrument of reform, the suffrage of the people.\" In one\r\nsense, at least, Jefferson was right. Taken collectively, the events of\r\n1800 do constitute a revolution--the first party revolution in American\r\nhistory. For a season it seemed as though the Republican party was to be\r\ndenied the right to exist as a legal opposition, entitled to attain\r\npower by persuasion. At the risk of incurring the suspicion of\r\ndisloyalty, if not of treason, the Republicans clung tenaciously to\r\ntheir rights as a minority. By persistent use of the press, by\r\nunremitting personal efforts, and by adroit electioneering, the leaders\r\nsucceeded in arousing the apathetic masses and converted their minority\r\ninto an actual majority. They won, therefore, for all time that\r\nrecognition of the right of legal opposition which is the primary\r\ncondition of successful popular government.\r\n\r\nThe change in political weather was foreshadowed during the summer of\r\n1800 by the removal of the seat of government to the banks of the\r\nPotomac. For ten years Philadelphia had been the center of the\r\npolitical and the social worlds, which for the only time in American\r\nhistory were then identical. Even those who knew the court life of\r\nEurope marveled at the display of wealth and fashion at this republican\r\ncourt. Of this social world, the \"President and his Lady\" were not\r\nmerely the titular and official leaders, but the real leaders. Between\r\nthe Virginia aristocracy and the wealthy families of Philadelphia there\r\nwere natural affinities. And if the second Federalist President and his\r\nconsort did not become leaders in quite the same sense, it was because\r\nJohn and Abigail Adams belonged temperamentally to a more restrained\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nThose who had enjoyed the hospitalities of the Morrises, the Binghams,\r\nand the Willings, and the bodily comforts of Philadelphia hotels and\r\ninns, were not likely to find any compensations in the unkempt,\r\nstraggling village which the Government and private speculators were\r\ntrying to convert into a fitting abode for the National Government.\r\nThere were few comfortable private dwellings. Most of the houses were\r\nmere huts occupied by laborers. Great tracts were left unfenced and\r\nuncultivated, in the firm expectation that an extraordinary rise in land\r\nvalue was about to take place. That craze for speculation in land which\r\nhad possessed those with any idle capital afflicted every landowner in\r\nor near the new city.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Adams finally reached the city, after a difficult journey\r\nthrough the forest between Baltimore and Washington, she met with\r\nanything but a cheering welcome. The President's house was not yet\r\nfinished: the plaster was not even dry on the walls. It was built on a\r\ngrand and superb scale, but the thrifty New England spirit of the\r\nPresident's wife was appalled at the prospect of having to employ thirty\r\nservants to keep the apartments in order and to tend the fires which had\r\neverywhere to be kept up to drive away the ague. The ordinary\r\nconveniences were wanting. For lack of a yard, Mrs. Adams made a\r\ndrying-room out of the great unfinished audience room. And the only\r\nsociety which she might enjoy was in Georgetown, two miles away. \"We\r\nhave, indeed,\" she wrote, \"come into _a new country_.\" But with true\r\npioneer spirit, she added, \"It is a beautiful spot, capable of every\r\nimprovement, and, the more I view it, the more I am delighted with it.\"\r\n\r\nThe gloom which enveloped the Federalists after the elections of the\r\nyear deepened as they straggled into the new capital in November. They\r\napproached their labors as men who would save what they could of a\r\nfalling world. For some time there had been an urgent demand for the\r\nreorganization of the federal judiciary. The justices of the Supreme\r\nCourt objected to circuit duty and urged the erection of a circuit court\r\nwith a permanent bench of judges. Such a reform was inevitable, it was\r\nsaid; therefore let the Federalists find what consolation they might\r\nfrom the possession of these new judgeships. Patriotism, too, suggested\r\nthe wisdom of filling the judiciary with men who would uphold the\r\nestablished order. \"In the future administration of our country,\"\r\nPresident Adams wrote to Jay, \"the firmest security we can have against\r\nthe effects of visionary schemes or fluctuating theories will be in a\r\nsolid judiciary.\"\r\n\r\nThe Judiciary Act of February 13, 1801, which embodied these aims, added\r\nfive new districts to those which had been established in 1789, and\r\ngrouped the twenty-two districts into six circuits. The amount of\r\npatronage which thus fell into the President's hands was very\r\nconsiderable, though it was grossly exaggerated by Republicans. The\r\npartisan press pictured President John Adams signing the commissions of\r\nthese new judgeships to the very stroke of twelve on the night of March\r\n3, and then entering his coach and driving in haste from the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n     BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\r\n\r\n     On the organization of parties at the close of the century there\r\n     are two works of importance: G. D. Luetscher, _Early Political\r\n     Machinery in the United States_ (1903), and M. Ostrogorski,\r\n     _Democracy and the Organization of Political Parties_ (2 vols.,\r\n     1902. Vol. II deals with parties in the United States).\r\n     Prosecutions under the Sedition Act are reported in F. Wharton,\r\n     _State Trials of the United States during the Administrations of\r\n     Washington and Adams_ (2 vols., 1846). F. T. Hill, _Decisive\r\n     Battles of the Law_ (1907), gives an interesting account of the\r\n     trial of Callender. Two special studies should be mentioned: E. D.\r\n     Warfield, _The Kentucky Resolutions of 1798_ (1887), and F. M.\r\n     Anderson, \"Contemporary Opinion of the Virginia and Kentucky\r\n     Resolutions,\" in the _American Historical Review_, vol. v. The\r\n     spirit of American politics at this time can be best appreciated\r\n     by perusing _Porcupine's Works_, the writings of Callender and Tom\r\n     Paine, and the letters of Fisher Ames, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas\r\n     Jefferson, and Timothy Pickering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nJEFFERSONIAN REFORMS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe society over whose political destiny Thomas Jefferson was to preside\r\nfor eight years was for the most part still rural and primitive.\r\nEvidences of a higher culture were wanting outside of communities like\r\nPhiladelphia, Boston, and Charleston. Even in Philadelphia, the literary\r\nas well as the social and political capital, the poet Moore could find\r\nonly a sacred few whom \"'twas bliss to live with, and 'twas pain to\r\nleave.\" American life had not yet created an atmosphere in which poetry,\r\nor even science, could thrive. The scientific curiosity of the younger\r\ngeneration does not seem to have been whetted in the least by the\r\nstartling experiments of Franklin; and the figure of Philip Freneau\r\nstands almost alone, though Connecticut, to be sure, boasted of her\r\nDwight, her Trumbull, and her Barlow. The \"Connecticut wits\" are\r\ninteresting personalities; but the society which could read, with\r\nanything akin to pleasure, Dwight's _Conquest of Canaan_--an epic in\r\neleven books with nearly ten thousand lines--was more admirable for its\r\nphysical endurance than for its poetical intuitions. Latrobe was quite\r\nright when he wrote that in America the labor of the hand took\r\nprecedence over that of the mind.\r\n\r\nThe American people were still engaged almost exclusively in agriculture\r\nand commerce. Manufacturing was in its infancy. In his report on\r\nmanufactures in 1791, Hamilton had named seventeen industries which had\r\nmade notable progress, but most of these were household crafts. In 1790,\r\nSamuel Slater had duplicated the inventions of Hargreaves and Arkwright,\r\nand had, with Moses Brown, of Rhode Island, set up a successful cotton\r\nmill at Pawtucket; but ten years later only four factories were in\r\noperation in the whole country.\r\n\r\nThe wars in Europe had created an unprecedented and ever-increasing\r\ndemand for American agricultural products. The price of foodstuffs like\r\nflour and meal reached a point which made possible enormous profits.\r\nShipping became, therefore, the indispensable handmaid of agriculture,\r\nas Jefferson observed. The volume of trade expanded at an astonishing\r\nrate. The total value of exports mounted from $20,000,000 in 1790 to\r\n$94,000,000 in the year of Jefferson's inauguration. One half of this\r\namount, however, represented the value of commodities like sugar,\r\ncoffee, and cocoa, which had been brought into the country for\r\nexportation. The easy and almost certain profits of this trade attracted\r\ncapital which might otherwise have gone into manufacturing.\r\n\r\n[Map: Distribution of Population 1800]\r\n\r\nShipping was stimulated also by the Navigation Act of 1789, which\r\nimposed lower tonnage duties in American ports on vessels built or owned\r\nby American citizens, and by the Tariff Act of the same year, which\r\nallowed a ten per cent deduction from the customs duties levied on goods\r\nimported in American vessels. These discriminating duties, together with\r\nthe law of 1792, which excluded foreign-built ships from American\r\nregistry, would have aided materially in the building of an American\r\nmarine, even in less prosperous times. The registered tonnage engaged in\r\nforeign trade increased from 346,254 in 1790 to 718,549 in 1801; and in\r\ncoast trade, from 103,775 to 246,255. Yet there was an artificial\r\nquality in this prosperity. \"Temporary benefits were mistaken for\r\npermanent advantages,\" writes a contemporary; \"so certain were the\r\nprofits on the foreign voyages, that commerce was only pursued as an\r\nart; ... the philosophy of commerce, if I am allowed the expression, was\r\ntotally neglected ... they [merchants] did not contemplate a period of\r\ngeneral peace, when each nation will carry its own productions, when\r\ndiscriminations will be made in favour of domestic tonnage, when foreign\r\ncommerce will be limited to enumerated articles, and when much\r\ncircumspection will be necessary in all our commercial transactions.\"\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said, either, that the American farmer studied the\r\nphilosophy of agriculture. He owed his crops less to intelligent\r\ncultivation of the soil than to provident Nature in a new and untilled\r\ncountry. Both his methods and his implements were bad, and resulted in\r\nthat land spoliation which has been the bane of American industry.\r\n\"Agriculture in the South,\" said John Taylor, of Caroline, \"does not\r\nconsist so much in cultivating land as in killing it\"; and the statement\r\nwas scarcely less true when applied to the Northern farmer. The soil was\r\nrapidly exhausted by planting the same crop year after year, for it was\r\neasier to take up fresh land than to restore productivity to the old.\r\nIndeed, the comments of foreign travelers at the close of the century\r\nsuggest doubts as to whether the American farmer understood the\r\nimportance of rotating his crops and of fertilizing his fields. The\r\nfarming implements in use showed little of that mechanical ingenuity\r\nwhich is now characteristic of the American people. The plough was still\r\na clumsy affair with heavy beam and handles, and wooden mould-board. The\r\nscythe, the sickle, and the flail were the same as their forbears had\r\nused for centuries.\r\n\r\nThe demand of Europe for the food products of the Northern and Middle\r\nStates obscured for a time the importance of cotton as an article of\r\nexport. In 1790, South Carolina and Georgia, then the only\r\ncotton-growing States, produced less than two million pounds of inferior\r\nquality, none of which was exported. A decade later thirty-five million\r\npounds were raised, one half of which was exported; and Virginia, North\r\nCarolina, and Tennessee had begun the cultivation. This sudden\r\ndevelopment was due to the invention of the cotton gin by Eli Whitney,\r\nin 1793. This machine facilitated the separation of the seed from the\r\nfiber of the short-staple variety of cotton, which alone could be\r\nprofitably cultivated in the uplands, and thus made possible a vast\r\nextension of the area of cotton culture.\r\n\r\nThe cotton gin came at an opportune moment for the Southern planters,\r\nsince rice and indigo were declining in importance as exports, and their\r\ngangs of African slaves were likely to become a burden. They could now\r\ncultivate cotton under an extensive system of agriculture with large\r\nimmediate profits. Experience proved, however, that the system was\r\nextraordinarily wasteful, leading to a rapid exhaustion of the soil.\r\nThis ever-recurring exhaustion of the soil and demand for new land was a\r\npotent cause of the incessant pressure of population into the virgin\r\nlands of the Southwest, in succeeding decades.\r\n\r\nThe new President was the embodiment of the national life. Although he\r\nwas tall of stature, he was not outwardly an impressive figure. His red,\r\nfreckled face wore a frank, good-natured expression, but he lacked\r\ndignity and poise. \"His whole figure has a loose, shackling air,\" wrote\r\na contemporary. \"A laxity of manner seemed shed about him ... even his\r\ndiscourse partook of his personal demeanor. It was loose and rambling.\"\r\nWith his blue coat and red waistcoat, his green velveteen breeches, yarn\r\nstockings, and slippers down at the heels, he seemed to an English\r\nvisitor, who saw him in 1804, \"very much like a tall, large-boned\r\nfarmer.\" Jefferson would have been the last to resent this epithet. No\r\nman had a more profound respect for tillers of the soil. Years before he\r\nhad written: \"Generally speaking, the proportion which the aggregate of\r\nthe other classes of citizens bears in any State to that of its\r\nhusbandmen is the proportion of its sound to its healthy parts, and is a\r\ngood enough barometer whereby to measure its degree of corruption.\" He\r\nrejoiced in the agricultural possibilities of America. Could he have had\r\nhis way, he would have made the republic, in the apt phrase of Mr. Henry\r\nAdams, \"an enlarged Virginia--a society to be kept pure and free by the\r\nabsence of complicated interests, by the encouragement of agriculture\r\nand of commerce as its handmaid.\" He abhorred cities and factories, and\r\ndreaded the growth of a manufacturing and capitalist class.\r\n\r\nAn agricultural society bent upon justice, Jefferson believed, could\r\nalways protect itself against the aggressions of foreign nations. \"Our\r\ncommerce,\" he wrote soon after his inauguration, \"is so valuable to\r\nthem, that they will be glad to purchase it, when the only price we ask\r\nis to do us justice. I believe we have in our own hands the means of\r\npeaceable coercion.\" In this wise the United States would set an example\r\nto the world of a society democratically organized and capable of\r\nunlimited moral and physical progress.\r\n\r\nAs the head of a party which had effected a revolution in government,\r\nJefferson's first care was to reconcile his opponents to Republican\r\nrule. The inaugural address emphasized the principles upon which all\r\nrepublican governments must be based. It is often said that these\r\nprinciples might have been uttered by Washington with equal\r\npropriety--as good Federalist doctrine. This is to mistake the\r\nsignificance of the revolution which had occurred. A party had triumphed\r\nwhich Federalists firmly believed inimical to all government. The\r\nannouncement that the fundamental principles to which all Americans were\r\nattached would guide the new Administration had a meaning which it would\r\nnot have had if uttered by a Federalist President. So far did Jefferson\r\nlean in holding out the olive branch that he ran the risk of minimizing\r\nthe revolution of 1800. To say that \"every difference of opinion is not\r\na difference of principle. We are all Republicans, we are all\r\nFederalists,\" was to contradict his often expressed conviction that his\r\nparty had saved the country from monarchy.\r\n\r\nAside from such generalities as that wise government consists in\r\nrestraining men from injuring one another and leaving them free to\r\nregulate their own pursuits, the inaugural address contains no\r\ndeclaration of purpose or policies. No such reticence marks Jefferson's\r\nprivate letters, which are, indeed, the best expression of his political\r\nphilosophy. Nowhere is the governing purpose of his Administration\r\nstated more clearly than in a letter written just before his\r\ninauguration. \"Let the general government be reduced to foreign concerns\r\nonly, and let our affairs be disentangled from those of all other\r\nnations, except as to commerce, which the merchants will manage the\r\nbetter the more they are left free to manage for themselves, and our\r\ngeneral government may be reduced to a very simple organization and a\r\nvery unexpensive one,--a few plain duties to be performed by a few\r\nservants.\"\r\n\r\nThe first and most troublesome task of the Administration was to select\r\nthese few servants. Even in naming the heads of departments, the\r\nPresident experienced some embarrassment, for, while Madison accepted\r\nreadily the Secretaryship of State and Albert Gallatin that of the\r\nTreasury, the naval portfolio went begging. Robert Smith, of Maryland,\r\nwas finally persuaded to accept the post. Two New Englanders, Henry\r\nDearborn and Levi Lincoln, became Secretary of War and Attorney-General\r\nrespectively. Far more difficult was the distribution of the lesser\r\nfederal offices. Had Jefferson been free to follow his own inclination,\r\nhe would probably have made few removals, even though such a course\r\nwould have seemed somewhat inconsistent with his belief that Federalists\r\nwere monarchists at heart. He yielded slowly and reluctantly to the\r\ndemands of his partisans for their share of the offices; but he\r\nprofessed to look forward with joy to that state of things when the only\r\nquestions concerning a candidate shall be, Is he honest? Is he capable?\r\nIs he faithful to the Constitution?\r\n\r\nThe embarrassment of the President was all the greater because removals\r\nfrom office were likely to defeat his policy of conciliating the\r\nFederalists; and because the bestowal of offices was likely to alienate\r\nsome local faction, as in New York, where the Clintons and the\r\nLivingstons were fighting the faction led by Burr. Once started on the\r\npolicy of removal, the descent was easy. The point of equilibrium\r\nbetween the parties was soon passed. By the end of Jefferson's second\r\nterm of office, the civil service was as preponderatingly Republican as\r\nit had been Federalist in 1800. It cannot be denied that Jefferson\r\nopened the door to the spoils system; but it should be stated also that\r\nhe endeavored to make fitness a qualification for office. The charge\r\nthat offices were given indiscriminately to \"wild Irishmen\" and French\r\nrefugees, is not sustained by the facts. On the whole Jefferson's\r\nappointments were not inferior in character to those of his\r\npredecessors. The vicious aspects of the spoils system did not appear\r\nfor a generation.\r\n\r\nAs an opposition party the Republicans had always declaimed vociferously\r\nagainst the powers wielded by the President. Jefferson sincerely wished\r\nto avoid what he termed the monarchical tendencies of his predecessors;\r\nand as an earnest of his intentions he abandoned not only levees but\r\nalso the practice of addressing Congress in a speech, since Republicans\r\nheld this custom a reprehensible imitation of the British speech from\r\nthe throne. Yet with characteristic indirection, Jefferson assigned\r\nother reasons for substituting a written message for the usual personal\r\naddress. \"I have had principal regard,\" said he, \"to the convenience of\r\nthe Legislature, to the economy of their time, to their relief from the\r\nembarrassment of immediate answers, on subjects not yet fully before\r\nthem, and to the benefits thence resulting to public affairs.\" It is\r\nhighly probable that Jefferson had his own convenience also in mind, for\r\nhe was not a ready nor an impressive speaker.\r\n\r\nThe keynote of the reforms which the President suggested tactfully to\r\nCongress was economy. It was to effect a reduction of the debt, indeed,\r\nthat Jefferson had called Gallatin to the head of the Treasury. Eight\r\nyears later he wrote: \"The discharge of the debt is vital to the\r\ndestinies of our government; we shall never see another President and\r\nSecretary of the Treasury making all other objects subordinate to this.\"\r\nBy laborious calculation Gallatin reached the conclusion that if\r\n$7,300,000 were set aside each year, the debt, principal and interest,\r\ncould be discharged within sixteen years. But the party was clamoring\r\nfor the reduction of taxes. The problem before the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury was how to accomplish these antithetical purposes. The most\r\nunpopular tax was unquestionably the excise. If this were cut out and\r\nthe estimated appropriation for the reduction of the debt were made, the\r\nGovernment would be unable to live within its income. The only\r\nalternative was to reduce expenditures. It was at this point that\r\nJefferson's \"chaste reformation\" of the government was to begin. Under\r\nthe Federalist regime, in anticipation of war with France, the\r\nexpenditures for the army and navy had mounted to six millions of\r\ndollars, nearly double the normal expenditure of those departments. All\r\ngood Republicans would welcome a proposal to reverse the militant policy\r\nof the Federalists, which, indeed, the return of peace seemed to make\r\nunnecessary. It was agreed that the expenditures for the army and navy\r\nshould be kept below two million dollars.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Jefferson's wish to avoid everything savoring of\r\nexecutive dictation, he could not abdicate his position as leader of his\r\nparty. Throughout his first term, at least, he was the master mind\r\ndirecting the policies of the party, in ways which were not less\r\neffective because they were personal and indirect. The leadership in the\r\nHouse of Representatives, which then overshadowed the Senate, fell to\r\nSouthern rather than to Northern Republicans. In close touch with the\r\nSpeaker, Nathaniel Macon, of North Carolina, and with the chairman of\r\nthe Committee of Ways and Means, the eccentric John Randolph, of\r\nRoanoke, the Administration scored comparatively easy victories over the\r\nFederalists on matters of financial policy.\r\n\r\nThe repeal of the Judiciary Act of 1801 was the second task which the\r\nPresident laid upon the shoulders of Congress. No act of the outgoing\r\nAdministration had given greater offense. Jefferson expressed a general\r\nimpression when he declared that the Federalists, driven from the\r\nlegislative and executive branches of the Government, had retreated into\r\nthe judiciary as their stronghold. \"There the remains of federalism are\r\nto be preserved and fed from the Treasury; and from that battery all the\r\nworks of republicanism are to be beaten down and destroyed.\" But no\r\nsuggestion of this animus toward the Federalist judges appeared in the\r\nstudied moderation of the President's message. The President contented\r\nhimself with presenting a record of the causes decided by the courts, in\r\norder that Congress might \"judge of the proportion which the institution\r\nbears to the business it has to perform.\"\r\n\r\n[Map: Vote on Repeal of the Judiciary Act House of\r\nRepresentatives March 2, 1802]\r\n\r\nTaking their cue from the President, the Republican leaders in Congress\r\nurged the repeal of the Judiciary Act on the ground that the new courts\r\nhad not justified their existence. Republican economy required that\r\nunnecessary, and therefore improper, institutions should be abolished.\r\nCertain bolder spirits like William Giles, of Virginia, however, frankly\r\nadmitted a fear of the \"ultimate censorial and controlling power\" of the\r\ncourts over all the departments of the Government--a control \"over\r\nlegislation, execution, and decision, and irresponsible to the people.\"\r\nIn the background of the active mind of this Virginian was hostility to\r\nthe new courts \"because of their tendency to produce a gradual\r\ndemolition of State Courts.\" If this last were the real reason for the\r\nrepeal of the act, consistency should have led the Republicans to revise\r\nthe whole judiciary system from the Supreme Court down. But for such\r\nradical action few, if any, were prepared. The repealing act passed the\r\nHouse by a party vote of fifty-nine to thirty-two, and was signed by the\r\nPresident on March 8, 1802.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the acrimonious debate over the judiciary, Federalists\r\nhad challenged the constitutional right and power of Congress to vacate\r\nthe judgeships, asserting that the plain intent of the Constitution is\r\nto place the judges beyond the power of Congress by prescribing a tenure\r\nof office during good behavior. The challenge was disquieting, for with\r\nJohn Marshall on the bench of the Supreme Court, the Republican\r\nreformation of the courts might be brought to naught by an adverse\r\ndecision. A supplementary act was therefore passed which prevented the\r\nSupreme Court from holding its usual session. It was hoped that when the\r\ncourt met in the following year, Federalist partisanship would have lost\r\nits violence.\r\n\r\nTwo obnoxious acts of the late Administration--the Alien and the\r\nSedition Acts--had expired by limitation. Congress suffered the Alien\r\nEnemies Act to remain upon the statute book, but insisted upon the\r\nrepeal of the Naturalization Act of the year 1798. The time of residence\r\nrequired of aliens before they could acquire citizenship was again fixed\r\nat five years. With these rather meager performances, the reforms of the\r\nRepublicans came to an end.\r\n\r\nPerhaps none of the last appointments of John Adams had so exasperated\r\nhis successor as that of John Marshall as Chief Justice of the Supreme\r\nCourt. Jefferson had an invincible repugnance for Marshall; and the\r\nfeeling was cordially reciprocated. Between these men there were\r\ntemperamental differences as wide as the ocean. Moreover, Jefferson\r\nentertained the belief that all appointments made by Adams after the\r\nresults of the election were known were nullities, on the theory that a\r\nretiring President might not bind his successor. Two years later, in\r\n1803, in the famous case of _Marbury_ v. _Madison_, the Supreme Court,\r\nspeaking through the Chief Justice, took sharp issue with the President.\r\nWilliam Marbury had applied to the court for a _mandamus_ to compel\r\nMadison, Secretary of State, to deliver his commission as justice of the\r\npeace, which, it was alleged, had been duly signed and sealed, but never\r\ndelivered. The Supreme Court held that Marbury was entitled to his\r\ncommission. \"To withhold his commission, therefore,\" said Marshall, \"is\r\nan act deemed by the Court not warranted by law, but violative of a\r\nlegal vested right.\" Let President Thomas Jefferson take notice of his\r\nconstitutional obligations.\r\n\r\nThe case of _Marbury_ v. _Madison_, however, has a much deeper\r\nsignificance for constitutional history. Having asserted the right of\r\nMarbury to his commission, the court disappointed expectations by\r\nrefusing to issue the writ of _mandamus_, on the ground that the power\r\nto issue such writs was not conferred by the Constitution upon the\r\nSupreme Court as part of its original jurisdiction. And as the Judiciary\r\nAct of 1789 had conferred this authority, the court was impelled to\r\ndeclare this provision of the act unwarranted by the Constitution and\r\ntherefore void. For the first time the Supreme Court asserted its power\r\nto pronounce an act of Congress repugnant to the Constitution not to be\r\nlaw, but void and of no effect. In substantiating its position, the\r\ncourt did not inquire into the difficult question whether the framers of\r\nthe Constitution intended or expected the national judiciary to exercise\r\nthis authority. It was enough for the purposes of the court that the\r\nConstitution was the supreme and paramount law of the land, established\r\nby the people of the United States. The Constitution defines and limits\r\nthe powers of government it must then control any legislative act\r\nrepugnant to it. \"Certainly all those who have framed written\r\nconstitutions contemplate them as forming the fundamental and paramount\r\nlaw of the nation, and, consequently, the theory of every such\r\ngovernment must be, that an act of the legislature, repugnant to the\r\nconstitution, is void.\"\r\n\r\nWith equal certitude the court declared that it was the province and\r\nduty of the judiciary to say what the law is. \"Those who apply the rule\r\nto particular cases, must of necessity expound and interpret that rule.\r\nIf two laws conflict with each other, the courts must decide on the\r\noperation of each.\" So if a law stood in opposition to the Constitution,\r\nthe court must decide which of these conflicting rules governs the case.\r\n\"This is of the very essence of judicial duty.\" Moreover, the judges may\r\nnot shut their eyes to the Constitution and see only the law, for they\r\nare bound by oath to administer justice not according to the laws alone,\r\nbut \"agreeably to the Constitution and the laws of the United States.\"\r\n\"Thus, the particular phraseology of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates confirms and strengthens the principle, supposed to be essential\r\nto all written constitutions, that a law repugnant to the Constitution\r\nis void; and that courts, as well as other departments, are bound by\r\nthat instrument.\"\r\n\r\nOn two other occasions the hostility of the Republican Administration\r\nprovoked a trial of strength with the Federalist judiciary. The\r\nimpeachment in 1804 of John Pickering, District Judge in New Hampshire,\r\non charges of intoxication and habits unfitting him for his duties,\r\namounted to little short of a tragedy. When the trial opened, Judge\r\nPickering did not appear, but representations made by his son showed\r\nbeyond a doubt that he was and had been for two years of unsound mind.\r\nTo convict a man of misdemeanors for which he was not morally\r\nresponsible seemed a travesty on justice. Yet there was no other\r\nconstitutional device for removing him. Though Pickering never appeared\r\nin person, the managers for the House pressed the prosecution; and\r\nrather than leave the administration of justice to a demented judge, the\r\nSenate pronounced the unhappy man \"guilty as charged,\" and resolved\r\nthat he should be removed from office.\r\n\r\nOn the same day that the Senate reached this monstrous decision, March\r\n12, 1804, the House voted to impeach Justice Samuel Chase, of the\r\nSupreme Court. While the defiant words of Chief Justice Marshall in the\r\nMarbury case were still rankling in Jefferson's bosom, Justice Chase had\r\ngone out of his way to attack the Administration, in addressing a grand\r\njury at Baltimore. The repeal of the Judiciary Act, he had declared, had\r\nshaken the independence of the national judiciary to its foundations.\r\n\"Our republican Constitution,\" said he, \"will sink into a mobocracy--the\r\nworst of all possible governments.\" To appreciate the effect of this\r\npartisan outburst upon the President, one must recall that Chase was the\r\njudge who had presided at the trials of Fries and of Callender, and who\r\nhad left the bench to electioneer for John Adams in the campaign of\r\n1800. Jefferson immediately wrote to Nicholson, who was managing\r\nPickering's impeachment, raising the question whether \"this seditious\r\nand official attack on the principles of our Constitution\" ought to go\r\nunpunished.\r\n\r\nSuch was Jefferson's way of initiating the measures of the\r\nAdministration. His supporters in the House were not over-eager to take\r\nup the gauntlet, but as usual the wishes of the President prevailed. The\r\nmanagement of the impeachment of Chase fell to John Randolph, who was as\r\nill-fitted by temperament for the difficult task as a man could be.\r\nInstead of impeaching Chase for his indiscretion at Baltimore, Randolph\r\ndragged into the indictment his conduct on the bench during the trials\r\nof Fries and of Callender, and certain errors in law which he was\r\nalleged to have committed. The effect of these latter items was to range\r\nall the bench on the side of Chase, for if a mere mistake in judgment\r\nwas a proper ground of impeachment, no judge was safe in his tenure.\r\nJustice Chase secured some of the best legal talent in the country to\r\nconduct his defense; and the trial assumed from the outset a spectacular\r\ncharacter from the personalities involved.\r\n\r\nThe managers of the impeachment were far from consistent in their\r\nconception of the nature of impeachable offenses. Randolph, Campbell,\r\nand Giles held that an impeachment was \"a kind of inquest into the\r\nconduct of an officer merely as it regards his office,\" rather than a\r\ncriminal prosecution. A judge, in short, might be removed for a mistake\r\nin the administration of the law. Nicholson rejected this theory,\r\ncontending that impeachment was essentially a criminal prosecution which\r\naimed at not only the removal but also the punishment of the offender.\r\nYet the managers had not specified any offense which could be called a\r\n\"high crime\" or \"misdemeanor\" within the meaning of the Constitution.\r\nThe counsel for Justice Chase, on the other hand, held consistently to\r\nthe position that a judge might not be impeached or removed from office\r\nfor anything short of an indictable offense, an offense indictable under\r\nthe known law of the land.\r\n\r\nFrom the first, the legal counsel for the accused were more than a\r\nmatch for the managers. Randolph's erratic course culminated in an\r\nimpassioned but incoherent speech which closed the argument for the\r\nprosecution and left the outcome hardly in doubt. Not one of the\r\narticles of impeachment received the two-thirds majority which was\r\nnecessary to convict. The eighth article, which touched upon the real\r\nprovocation for the trial,--the harangue at Baltimore,--received the\r\nhighest vote; but nearly one fourth of the Republican Senators refused\r\nto sustain the managers. The acquittal of Chase was, therefore, a\r\njudgment against Randolph. He never recovered his lost prestige as the\r\nleader of his party in the House. Jefferson could accept Randolph's\r\ndownfall with equanimity, but not the failure of the impeachment. Years\r\nafterward he wrote, bitterly that impeachment was \"an impracticable\r\nthing, a mere scarecrow.\" From this time on, said he, the judges held\r\noffice without any sense of responsibility, led \"by a crafty chief-judge\r\nwho sophisticates the law to his mind by the turn of his own reasoning.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\r\n\r\n     Although the general histories contain much that is important for\r\n     an understanding of the administrations of Jefferson, the\r\n     authority _par excellence_ is Henry Adams, _History of the United\r\n     States of America_ (9 vols., 1889-91). Chapters I-VI of the first\r\n     volume contain an excellent description of American society about\r\n     1800; but for the details of social and economic life the reader\r\n     will turn to McMaster. A briefer account of the Jeffersonian\r\n     regime may be found in Channing, _The Jeffersonian System,\r\n     1801-1811_ (in _The American Nation_, vol. 12, 1906). Henry Adams\r\n     has also contributed two biographies to this period: _Life of\r\n     Albert Gallatin_ (1878), and _John Randolph_(1882). The Federalist\r\n     point of view is admirably presented in S. E. Morison, _The Life\r\n     and Letters of Harrison Gray Otis_ (2 vols., 1913). The larger\r\n     biographies of Jefferson are: H. S. Randall, _Life of Thomas\r\n     Jefferson_ (3 vols., 1858), commonly referred to as the standard\r\n     biography, though exceedingly partisan; G. Tucker, _Life of Thomas\r\n     Jefferson_ (2 vols., 1837); and James Parton, _Life of Thomas\r\n     Jefferson_(1874).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE PURCHASE OF THE PROVINCE OF LOUISIANA\r\n\r\n\r\nNot a war cloud was in the sky when Jefferson took the oath of office.\r\nThe European calm, to be sure, proved to be only a lull in the tempest\r\nof war which was to rage fifteen years longer; but no man could have\r\ncast the horoscope of Europe in that age of storm and stress. The times\r\nseemed auspicious for the Republican program of retrenchment and\r\neconomy. Jefferson was so sanguine of continued peace that he would have\r\nbeen glad to lay up all seven of the frigates which then constituted the\r\nnavy in the eastern branch of the Potomac, where \"they would be under\r\nthe immediate eye of the department, and would require but one set of\r\nplunderers to take care of them.\" Peace was his passion, he frankly\r\navowed. He would have been glad to banish all the paraphernalia of war.\r\nYet within three months the United States was at war with an\r\ninsignificant Mediterranean power and menaced by France from an\r\nunexpected quarter.\r\n\r\nEarly in the spring of 1801, the Pasha of Tripoli, one of the Barbary\r\npowers which for years had preyed upon the commerce of the\r\nMediterranean, declared war upon the United States by cutting down the\r\nflagstaff at the residence of the American consul. European states had\r\npurchased immunity for their commerce by paying tribute to these\r\nrapacious pirates; and the United States had followed the custom. The\r\nPasha of Tripoli, however, was dissatisfied with the American tribute, a\r\npaltry eighty-three thousand dollars, and demanded more. The other\r\nBarbary powers threatened to make common cause with him. Anticipating\r\ntrouble, Jefferson had sent a small squadron to the Mediterranean even\r\nbefore the dramatic act of the Pasha at the American consulate; and\r\nhostilities began on August 1 with the capture of a corsair by the\r\nschooner Enterprise. Therewith Jefferson's dreams of a navy for coast\r\ndefense only vanished in thin air.\r\n\r\nContrary to all expectations, the Tripolitan War dragged on for four\r\nyears, causing the peace-loving Administration no end of embarrassment.\r\nSo far from reducing expenditures, Gallatin was obliged to devise new\r\nways and means for an ever-increasing naval force. An additional duty of\r\ntwo and one half per cent was laid on all imports which paid an _ad\r\nvalorem_ duty, and the proceeds were kept as a separate treasury\r\naccount. The Administration was sensitive to the charge that it was\r\nguilty of the very crime which it had accused the Federalists of\r\ncommitting--\"taxing the industry of our fellow citizens to accumulate\r\ntreasure for war.\" With superior wisdom and a higher sense of popular\r\nresponsibility, the Republicans, so the argument ran, were establishing\r\na \"Mediterranean Fund,\" so that the people might know in detail just\r\nwhat was collected and spent for war purposes.\r\n\r\nTales of individual daring go far to relieve the tedious record of\r\nineffective blockades and bombardments during the war. Two exploits left\r\nan imperishable memory in the minds of contemporaries--Lieutenant\r\nStephen Decatur's destruction of the captured frigate Philadelphia,\r\nunder the guns of the forts in the harbor of Tripoli; and the tragic\r\ndeath of Lieutenant Richard Somers and the crew of the Intrepid, as they\r\nwere about to blow up the Tripolitan gunboats in the harbor. These deeds\r\nof heroic adventure created the very last thing that Jefferson desired,\r\nsomething closely akin to an _esprit de corps_ in the new navy.\r\n\r\nIt was not so much the onslaughts of Commodore Preble's gunboats,\r\nhowever, as an unexpected attack on his eastern frontier which brought\r\nthe Pasha to terms. His exiled brother, Hamet Caramelli, had fallen in\r\nwith an American adventurer by the name of Eaton, who persuaded him to\r\njoin an expedition against their common enemy. With a motley army they\r\nmarched across the desert from Egypt and fell upon the outlying domains\r\nof the Pasha. That astute monarch then yielded to persuasion. On June 3,\r\n1805, with many protestations that he was being subjected to humiliating\r\nterms, he agreed to live on terms of peace with the United States and\r\nrenounce all claim to tribute; but his injured feelings were salved by a\r\nransom of sixty thousand dollars for the crew of the Philadelphia. The\r\nPasha's brother was rewarded with a pension of two hundred dollars a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment that hostilities broke out in the Mediterranean,\r\nJefferson heard disquieting news from France. \"There is considerable\r\nreason to apprehend,\" he wrote to Monroe, on May 26, 1801, \"that Spain\r\ncedes Louisiana and the Floridas to France. It is a policy very unwise\r\nin both, and very ominous to us.\" What Jefferson apprehended was,\r\nindeed, an accomplished fact. On October 1, 1800, the day after Joseph\r\nNapoleon, in the name of his brother, set his hand to the Treaty of\r\nMorfontaine, which restored amicable relations between France and the\r\nUnited States, General Berthier under instructions from Napoleon signed\r\nat Ildefonso a treaty which restored Louisiana to France. In effect, as\r\nMr. Henry Adams says, the second treaty undid the work of the first.\r\n\r\nThe retrocession of Louisiana, long desired and sought by the Directory,\r\nwas regarded by Talleyrand as a diplomatic triumph of first magnitude.\r\nThe price, easily paid by one who held Italy under his iron heel, was a\r\nkingdom in Tuscany for the young Duke of Parma, nephew and son-in-law of\r\nCharles IV of Spain. The gateway to this vast province was New Orleans,\r\nand the avenue of approach lay by way of Santo Domingo, once an\r\nimportant French colony, but now under the rule of Toussaint\r\nL'Ouverture. Before Talleyrand's dream of a revived colonial empire in\r\nthe heart of the North American continent could be realized, this\r\n\"gilded African\" must be removed and Santo Domingo restored to its\r\nformer position as the center of the French West Indies. The conquest of\r\na negro republic surely could not be a difficult undertaking for one who\r\nhad humbled Austria on the battlefields of northern Italy. In November,\r\n1801, Napoleon dispatched Leclerc with an army of ten thousand men to\r\nrecover Santo Domingo.\r\n\r\nJefferson was thoroughly alarmed at the news of Leclerc's expedition.\r\n\"Every eye in the United States,\" he wrote, \"is now fixed on this affair\r\nof Louisiana. Perhaps nothing since the Revolutionary War has produced\r\nmore uneasy sensations through the body of the nation.\" No discerning\r\nman could mistake the significance of the expedition; the French troops\r\nwould proceed to Louisiana after finishing their work in Santo Domingo.\r\nThe retrocession of Louisiana, in short, as Jefferson said, completely\r\nreversed all the political relations of the United States. Hitherto,\r\nfrom the Republican point of view, France had been our natural friend.\r\nHenceforth, as the possessor of New Orleans, through which three eighths\r\nof the produce of the West passed to market, she became a natural and\r\nhabitual enemy. \"France placing herself in that door,\" wrote Jefferson\r\nto Livingston, \"assumes to us the attitude of defiance. The impetuosity\r\nof her temper, the energy and restlessness of her character, placed in a\r\npoint of eternal friction with us, and our character, ... these\r\ncircumstances render it impossible that France and the United States can\r\ncontinue long friends when they meet in so irritable a position.... The\r\nday that France takes possession of New Orleans fixes the sentence which\r\nis to restrain her forever within her low-water mark. It seals the union\r\nof two nations who in conjunction can maintain exclusive possession of\r\nthe ocean. From that moment we must marry ourselves to the British fleet\r\nand nation.\"\r\n\r\nEven as he expressed his apprehensions to Livingston, then Minister to\r\nFrance, Jefferson suggested ways and means for averting the clash of\r\nconflicting interests. If France was bent on possessing and holding\r\nLouisiana, might she not make concessions for the sake of retaining the\r\nfriendship of the United States? Livingston was to sound the French\r\nGovernment to ascertain whether it would entertain the idea of ceding\r\nthe Island of New Orleans and the Floridas. \"We should consider New\r\nOrleans and the Floridas as equivalent for the risk of a quarrel with\r\nFrance produced by her vicinage,\" he assured Livingston.\r\n\r\nWhat the Western world had to fear from the French occupation of\r\nLouisiana appeared in November, 1802, when Governor Claiborne, of the\r\nMississippi Territory, reported that the right of deposit at New Orleans\r\nhad been withdrawn. The act, to be sure, was that of the Spanish\r\nintendant, but every one believed that it had been incited by France.\r\nThe people of the Western waters, particularly in Tennessee and\r\nKentucky, were outraged and demanded instant war against the aggressor.\r\nEven in Congress a war party raised its head. During all this popular\r\nclamor the self-restraint of the Administration was admirable. The\r\nannual message ignored the existence of the war party and referred to\r\nthe cession of Louisiana in colorless language worthy of Talleyrand.\r\n\r\nThe Administration was not, however, without a well-considered policy.\r\nIn January, at the instance of party leaders, an appropriation of two\r\nmillion dollars was voted by Congress \"to defray any expenses in\r\nrelation to the intercourse between the United States and foreign\r\nnations\"; and James Monroe was appointed Minister Extraordinary to\r\nFrance and Spain, to aid Livingston and Pinckney in \"enlarging and more\r\neffectually securing our rights and interests in the river Mississippi\r\nand in the territories eastward thereof.\"\r\n\r\nMeantime, Napoleon's colonial schemes had received a decisive check. The\r\ntransfer of Louisiana had been delayed by the opposition of Godoy, who\r\nhad returned to royal favor in Spain; Leclerc's invading army had been\r\nworn away by the attrition of incessant war with the negroes; a second\r\narmy had been decimated by yellow fever; and finally Leclerc himself had\r\nsuccumbed to the dread destroyer, leaving the remnants of the French\r\ntroops to their fate. Without the most extraordinary exertions, Santo\r\nDomingo was lost; and what was Louisiana without the island which was\r\nthe very heart of the projected colonial system? The First Consul was\r\nalmost ready to abandon a project which after all had originated in\r\nTalleyrand's brain rather than in his own. What he sought was a fair\r\npretext to cover his retreat from failure.\r\n\r\nLivingston plied the French Ministers with arguments to prove that it\r\nwas good policy to put the Americans in possession of the Island of\r\nOrleans. One day, while he was repeating the old story, Talleyrand\r\nsuddenly asked what he would give for the whole of Louisiana. For the\r\nmoment Livingston was nonplussed, and declined to make any offer.\r\nTalleyrand repeated his question and Livingston replied that twenty\r\nmillions of francs would be a fair price, if France would pay the\r\nspoliation claims of American citizens since the Treaty of 1800.\r\nTalleyrand demurred: the sum was too small. Thereupon Livingston\r\npromised to advise with Monroe who was expected soon.\r\n\r\nMonroe, as it happened, arrived on this very day. On the following day\r\nLivingston learned casually from Marbois, a minister who stood very\r\nclose to the First Consul, that Napoleon had named a hundred million\r\nfrancs and the payment of the American spoliation claims as the price of\r\nLouisiana. Further conversation elicited the information that Napoleon\r\nwould consider an offer of sixty million francs with claims amounting to\r\ntwenty millions more. For a fortnight the two envoys, at the risk of\r\nlosing everything, sought to secure better terms. But the First Consul\r\nwould not abate his demands. On May 2, 1803, Livingston and Monroe set\r\ntheir signatures to a treaty by which Napoleon agreed to sell a province\r\nof which he was not in possession and which he had contracted never to\r\nalienate. The price to be paid was the sum last named, amounting in\r\nAmerican figures to $11,250,000. The amount of outstanding claims which\r\nthe United States agreed to assume was estimated at $3,750,000. After\r\nsigning his name to the treaty, Livingston rose and shook hands with\r\nMonroe and Marbois. \"We have lived long,\" he said with emotion, \"but\r\nthis is the noblest work of our lives.\"\r\n\r\nIn less exalted moments, Livingston and Monroe may well have\r\nexperienced some disquietude at what they had done. The instructions\r\ngiven to Monroe contemplated no more extensive purchase than New Orleans\r\nand West Florida, at a sum not exceeding $10,000,000. The envoys had set\r\nout to purchase a tract of land which controlled the delta of the\r\nMississippi they had acquired an empire beyond the Mississippi whose\r\nlimits they did not know, at a price which exceeded their allowance by\r\n$5,000,000. Besides, it was not at first believed that West Florida was\r\nincluded in this purchase. Livingston was keenly disappointed, until on\r\nnarrower examination he found, in the words of the treaty, evidence\r\nwhich satisfied him that France--to quote Mr. Henry Adams--\"had actually\r\nbought West Florida without knowing it and had sold it to the United\r\nStates without being paid for it.\" The words on which he founded his\r\ntheory were those which retroceded Louisiana \"with the same extent as it\r\nnow has in the hands of Spain, and that it had when France possessed it,\r\nand such as it should be according to the treaties subsequently entered\r\ninto between Spain and the other States.\" Monroe soon adopted\r\nLivingston's view and pressed it upon the President.\r\n\r\nThe news of the purchase of Louisiana reached the United States in the\r\nlatter part of June and occasioned much rejoicing among stanch\r\nRepublicans of the Middle and Southern States. The people east of the\r\nAlleghanies were densely ignorant about this Spanish province, but they\r\nsensed in a vague way that its possession by a power like France would\r\nhave dragged the United States into the maelstrom of European politics.\r\nThe Federalists of the Eastern States looked askance at this as at every\r\nact of the Administration of Thomas Jefferson, without knowing anything\r\nabout this vast domain beyond the Mississippi. The President himself was\r\nnot much better informed about Louisiana. In a report to Congress he\r\nundertook to put together such information as he could cull from books\r\nof travel and pick up by hearsay. His credulity led him into some\r\namazing statements. A thousand miles up the Missouri, he stated soberly,\r\nthere was a salt mountain, one hundred and eighty miles long and\r\nforty-five miles in width, composed of solid rock salt, without any\r\ntrees or even shrubs on it. He would not have believed the tale but for\r\nthe testimony of travelers who had shown specimens of the salt to the\r\npeople of St. Louis. Federalist newspapers made merry over the\r\nPresident's discovery. \"Can this be Lot's wife?\" asked one editor.\r\n\r\nBut Jefferson had already taken steps to dispel general ignorance about\r\nthe Far West. Securing from Congress an appropriation for an expedition\r\namong the Missouri Indians, ostensibly to extend the external commerce\r\nof the United States, he commissioned his private secretary, Meriwether\r\nLewis, and William Clark, brother of George Rogers Clark, to undertake\r\none of the most important explorations in American annals. With a body\r\nof picked men, Lewis and Clark made their way to the upper waters of the\r\nMissouri, and passed the winter of 1804-05 among the Mandans. In the\r\nfollowing spring and summer they crossed the Rocky Mountains to the\r\nwaters of the Columbia. Here they spent a second winter, and then began\r\ntheir arduous return, by way of the Great Divide, the Yellowstone River,\r\nand the Missouri, to St. Louis. The journals of the members of this\r\nexpedition are a remarkable record of personal adventures and scientific\r\nobservations. It was not until 1814, however, that the details of this\r\nexpedition were given to the public.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Lieutenant Zebulon Montgomery Pike had won immediate fame by\r\npublishing an account of two thrilling expeditions into the Far West. On\r\nthe first expedition Pike traced the upper course of the Mississippi\r\nalmost to its source; on the second, begun soon after his return to St.\r\nLouis in 1806, he followed the course of the Arkansas to the peak which\r\nbears his name. His attempt to explore the headwaters of the Rio Grande,\r\nwhich he mistook for the Red River, led to his capture by the Spanish\r\nauthorities. After a roundabout journey through Mexico and Texas, he was\r\nreleased on the Louisiana frontier.\r\n\r\nUnexpected as the acquisition of Louisiana was to the Administration,\r\nPresident Jefferson was quick to appreciate the vast importance of the\r\nprovince to the United States. \"Giving us the sole dominion of the\r\nMississippi,\" he wrote, \"it excludes those bickerings with foreign\r\npowers, which we know of a certainty would have put us at war with\r\nFrance immediately: and it secures to us the course of a peaceable\r\nnation.\" At the same time he was equally quick to see that the\r\nacquisition would give \"a handle to the malcontents.\" To his intimates\r\nhe avowed with the utmost frankness that the Administration had\r\nexceeded its constitutional powers. The Constitution, he conceived, did\r\nnot contemplate the acquisition of territory not included within the\r\nlimits fixed by the Treaty of 1783. Yet he was firmly convinced of the\r\npractical necessity of ratifying the treaty of purchase. The only way\r\nout of the dilemma, he thought, was frankly \"to rely on the nation to\r\nsanction an act done for its great good, without its previous\r\nauthority.\"\r\n\r\nNever doubting that so benevolent a purpose would be cordially approved,\r\nJefferson drafted an amendment to the Constitution authorizing the\r\nacquisition of Louisiana and providing for its government. To his\r\nsurprise, leading Republicans received his proposal with indifference,\r\nnot to say with coolness. Nicholas thought that the power to acquire\r\nterritory by treaty might fairly be inferred from the Constitution, and\r\nadvised the President not to run the risk of turning the Senate against\r\nthe treaty by raising constitutional scruples. In much distress of\r\nspirit Jefferson replied that to assume by free construction the power\r\nto acquire territory was to make blank paper of the Constitution. If the\r\ntreaty-making power could be stretched in this fashion, then there was\r\nno limit to its extent. But finding that his party did not share his\r\nscruples, Jefferson abandoned his amendment to the Constitution,\r\n\"confiding that the good sense of our country will correct the evil of\r\nconstruction when it shall produce ill effects.\" Hamilton in all the\r\npride of triumphant Federalism had never gone further than this.\r\n\r\nThe debates in Congress over the treaty are full of interest to the\r\nstudent of constitutional law. The treaty fairly bristled with\r\ncontroversial points. The exigencies of politics played havoc with\r\nconsistency. Parties seemed to have changed sides. Federalists borrowed\r\nstate-rights arguments without a tremor; and Republicans employed the\r\nlanguage of centralization with Federalist facility. Federalists from\r\nNew England looked beyond the immediate issue and discerned the\r\ninevitable economic as well as political consequences of westward\r\nexpansion. The men who would have naturally populated the vacant lands\r\nof Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont would inevitably seek this \"new\r\nparadise of Louisiana,\" observed a New England pamphleteer. Jeffersonian\r\nDemocracy rather than Federalism would become the creed of these\r\ntransplanted New Englanders, if Ohio were a fair example of future\r\nWestern Commonwealths. Moreover, as these new States would in all\r\nprobability enter the Union as slaveholding communities, they would\r\nfurther impair the influence of the Eastern States in the National\r\nGovernment. Even the remnant of the Federalist party in the South\r\nopposed the purchase of Louisiana, fearing that the Atlantic States\r\nwould be depressed in influence by the formation of great States in the\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nUpon one great constitutional principle, both Federalists and\r\nRepublicans were disposed to agree: that the United States had the power\r\nto acquire foreign territory, either by treaty or conquest. Senator\r\nTracy, of Connecticut, conceded this point, but denied that the\r\ninhabitants of an acquired territory could be admitted into the Union\r\nand be made citizens by treaty. In providing that \"the inhabitants of\r\nthe ceded territory shall be incorporated in the Union,\" the\r\nAdministration had exceeded its constitutional authority. The consent of\r\nall the States was necessary to admit into the Union. Senator Pickering,\r\nof Massachusetts, held the same view. \"I believe the assent of each\r\nindividual State to be necessary,\" said he, \"for the admission of a\r\nforeign country as an associate in the Union, in like manner as in a\r\ncommercial house the consent of each member would be necessary to admit\r\na new partner into the company.\" To this line of argument, Taylor, of\r\nVirginia, replied that the words of the treaty did not contemplate the\r\nerection of the ceded territory as a State, but its incorporation as a\r\nTerritory.\r\n\r\nOn October 17, 1803, the Senate ratified the treaty by a vote\r\nof twenty-four to seven. Two constitutional principles seemed,\r\ntherefore, to be decided: the Government had a constitutional\r\nright to acquire foreign territory; and the treaty-making power could\r\nincorporate--whatever that expression might mean--such territory into\r\nthe Union. A third matter of policy had yet to be determined: what\r\npowers had Congress over the new territory? Two courses lay open, either\r\nto make Louisiana a part of the \"territory\" which the Constitution gives\r\nCongress power to \"dispose of,\" or to hold the province as a dependency\r\napart from other organized Territories. The provisional act which\r\nCongress adopted pointed in this latter direction, since it authorized\r\nthe President to take possession of the province and concentrated all\r\npowers, civil and military, in the hands of agents to be appointed by\r\nhim. When objection was made that such despotic authority was\r\nincompatible with the Constitution, Rodney, of Maryland, declared in the\r\nHouse of Representatives that Congress had a power in the Territories\r\nwhich it could not exercise in the States, and that the limitations of\r\npower found in the Constitution were applicable to States and not to\r\nTerritories. The Republicans were making rapid progress in learning the\r\nvocabulary of Federalism.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the ironies of history that the province over which parties\r\nbattled with so much display of legal profundity was not yet in the\r\npossession of the First Consul. Six months after the ratification of the\r\ntreaty, in the old Cabildo at New Orleans, Laussat received from the\r\nSpanish governor the keys of the city and took possession of the\r\nprovince in the name of his master. For twenty days the Tricolor floated\r\nover the Place d'Armes, emblem of the shadowy French tenure. On December\r\n2, it, in turn, gave place to the Stars and Stripes, as Louisiana passed\r\ninto the hands of the last of its rulers, the puissant young republic.\r\n\r\nIn the following year Congress divided the province, giving to the\r\nsouthern part, the Territory of Orleans, which contained most of the\r\ninhabitants, a separate territorial government, and annexing the\r\nsparsely settled upper part to the Indiana Territory. The Act of 1804\r\nwas roundly abused because it gave to the President the appointment of\r\nall officers in the Territory of Orleans, even the appointment of the\r\nlegislative council of thirteen. By the treaty, it was pointed out, the\r\ninhabitants of Louisiana were guaranteed all \"the rights, advantages,\r\nand immunities of citizens of the United States.\" Was not representative\r\ngovernment one of these privileges? The obvious answer was the\r\nunpreparedness of the Spanish inhabitants for Anglo-American\r\ninstitutions. To the Western American who floated down the Mississippi,\r\npast the cotton-fields and sugar plantations cultivated by African\r\nnegroes, and who landed his cargo on the levee at New Orleans, among the\r\nmotley throngs, province and city seemed like a foreign country, and the\r\ninhabitants aliens in speech and habits. From the buildings, with their\r\nmany arcades and balconies and varied coloring, to the courts of law\r\nwhere the Code Napoleon, introduced by Laussat, added confusion to the\r\nSpanish law, the atmosphere of New Orleans was that of a city of the Old\r\nWorld, where one civilization was superimposed upon an older. Men bred\r\nin the traditions of the English law might reasonably doubt whether the\r\npeople of Louisiana were ready for self-government.\r\n\r\nBefore the new territorial government could be organized, a remonstrance\r\nhad been drawn up by the people of Louisiana and forwarded by three\r\ncommissioners with all possible dispatch to Washington. In the following\r\nyear (1805), Congress so far yielded to the complaints of the people of\r\nLouisiana as to authorize an elective assembly and to hold out the\r\npromise of eventual statehood.\r\n\r\nBut what were the bounds of Louisiana? No one knew with certitude. The\r\nletters of Livingston and Monroe had convinced Jefferson that Louisiana\r\nincluded at least West Florida, and for two years he sought by every\r\ndiplomatic device to wrest from Spain a confirmation of this shadowy\r\ntitle. That Spain did not intend to cede West Florida and that France\r\nhad no expectation of receiving it seems clear enough from the\r\ninstructions to Laussat. What he handed over to the American\r\nrepresentative was Louisiana, with the Rio Bravo and the Iberville as\r\nboundaries. With some show of right, Jefferson might have occupied\r\nTexas; he preferred, however, to chase his phantom claim to Florida. For\r\nTexas nobody then cared, but the Floridas were coveted by Southern\r\nplanters.\r\n\r\nIn a letter written soon after the signing of the Louisiana Treaty,\r\nRobert Livingston relates a suggestive conversation which he had with\r\nTalleyrand. \"What are the eastern bounds of Louisiana?\" asked Livingston\r\nrather naively. \"I do not know,\" replied Talleyrand; \"you must take it\r\nas we received it.\" \"But what did you mean to take?\" Livingston\r\ninsisted. \"I do not know,\" was the reply. \"Then you mean that we shall\r\nconstrue it our own way?\" \"I can give you no direction,\" replied the\r\nastute Frenchman. \"You have made a noble bargain for yourselves, and I\r\nsuppose you will make the most of it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\r\n\r\n     The history of the Barbary Wars is well told by G. W. Allen, _Our\r\n     Navy and the Barbary Corsairs_(1905), and by C. O. Paullin,\r\n     _Commodore John Rodgers_(1910). The investigations of Henry Adams\r\n     in foreign archives enabled him to treat the diplomatic history of\r\n     the purchase of Louisiana with great fullness. F. A. Ogg, _The\r\n     Opening of the Mississippi_(1904), and J. K. Hosmer, _The\r\n     Louisiana Purchase_ (1902), contain brief accounts of the\r\n     acquisition of the province. The actual route of the Lewis and\r\n     Clark expedition may be traced with the aid of O. D. Wheeler, _The\r\n     Trail of Lewis and Clark_, 1804-1904 (1904). The constitutional\r\n     aspects of the Louisiana Treaty and the subsequent legislation for\r\n     the territory are discussed at length by Adams, and less\r\n     satisfactorily by Schouler and Von Holst. Channing, _The\r\n     Jeffersonian System, 1801-1811_ (1906), contains a good account of\r\n     the whole episode. The problem of the original boundaries is\r\n     discussed by F. E. Chadwick, _The Relations of the United States\r\n     and Spain_(1909).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nFACTION AND CONSPIRACY\r\n\r\n\r\nDown to the end of the eighteenth century, the people of New England\r\npossessed a greater degree of social solidarity than any other section\r\nof the Union. Descended from English stock, imbued with common religious\r\nand political traditions, and bound together by the ties of a common\r\necclesiastical polity, they cherished, as Jefferson expressed it, \"a\r\nsort of family pride\" which existed nowhere else between people of\r\ndifferent States. In New England, there were elements of political and\r\nreligious dissent, to be sure, but the domination of the Congregational\r\nclergy and the magistracy was hardly less complete in the year 1800 than\r\nfifty years earlier. New England was governed by \"the wise, the good,\r\nand the rich.\" All the forces of education, property, religion, and\r\nrespectability were united in the maintenance of the established order\r\nagainst the assaults of democracy. New England Federalism was not so\r\nmuch a body of political doctrines as a state of mind. Abhorrence of the\r\nforces liberated by the French Revolution was perhaps the dominating\r\nemotion. Democracy seemed an aberration of the human mind, which was\r\nbound everywhere to produce the same results in society. Jacobinism was\r\nthe inevitable outcome. \"The principles of democracy are everywhere what\r\nthey have been in France,\" wrote Ames. \"Democracy is a troubled spirit,\r\nfated never to rest, and whose dreams, if it sleeps, present only\r\nvisions of hell.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1801, New England was in bitter, irreconcilable opposition to the\r\nNational Administration. The situation was fraught with grave\r\npossibilities. Jefferson himself looked forward to \"an uneasy\r\ngovernment,\" if the whole body of New England continued in opposition to\r\nRepublican principles. Ordinary political opposition was to be expected,\r\nof course; but a sectional opposition, fortified by a social solidarity\r\nlike that of New England, was a menace to the Union. From the moment\r\nwhen he took the oath of office, Jefferson directed his best energies to\r\nthe Republican conquest of New England. It was a policy dictated not\r\nonly by partisan considerations, but also by the highest instincts of\r\nstatesmanship. The fair-minded historian is bound to record that the\r\nJeffersonian party in this period of its history was, in spite of all\r\nits inconsistencies, a potent agency in the maintenance of the Union.\r\n\r\nThe first conquest of the Republicans was that of Rhode Island in the\r\nfirst year of the new Administration. The President was deeply gratified\r\nby what he called \"the regeneration of Rhode Island,\" interpreting the\r\nevent as \"the beginning of that resurrection of the genuine spirit of\r\nNew England.\" Vermont, he prophesied, would next emerge from under the\r\nyoke of the Federalist hierarchy; and the fall election verified his\r\nprediction. Elsewhere the contest was more stubborn and prolonged, but\r\nthe Federalists noted with alarm that the Republican vote was\r\nincreasing everywhere. By the end of Jefferson's first term, the number\r\nof Republican voters in New England very nearly equaled that of their\r\nopponents.\r\n\r\nThe ranks of the Republican party were recruited largely from the rural\r\ndistricts, where hostility to the mercantile and moneyed classes was\r\nmost bitter. It was the old alignment of the men of little or no\r\npersonal property against the prosperous and well-to-do classes. From\r\nthis point of view the Republican movement was an attack upon the\r\nprivileged orders, an attempt to break down the social hierarchy of New\r\nEngland. Closely connected with the political movement was also the\r\nstruggle of the Baptists and the Methodists to secure religious freedom\r\nin Massachusetts and Connecticut. The dissenters looked to Jefferson as\r\ntheir natural leader; and the bitter opposition of the Congregational\r\nclergy to the spread of democracy was due to their persistent, and no\r\ndoubt sincere, belief that dissent and democracy were manifestations of\r\nthe same radical and destructive spirit.\r\n\r\nThe rising tide of Republicanism and the increasing popularity of the\r\nAdministration cast the Federalist leaders into the deepest gloom. The\r\nannexation of Louisiana was regarded as a mortal blow, since it\r\nimperiled the ascendency of New England in the Union, and New England\r\nwas the stronghold of Federalism. At the beginning of the year 1804,\r\nmost of the Federalist members of Congress from New England were agreed\r\nin thinking that a crisis was approaching. Democracy was about to\r\ntriumph over the forces of law and order. The only question was how to\r\nsave their section, where the ravages of Jacobinism could yet be stayed.\r\nThere was but one answer, from the point of view of Senator Timothy\r\nPickering. The people of the Eastern States could not reconcile their\r\nhabits, views, and interests with those of the South and West:\r\ntherefore, let them withdraw from the Union and form a Northern\r\nConfederation. Plumer, of New Hampshire, and Tracy and Griswold, of\r\nConnecticut, were in hearty agreement with this view. Pickering then put\r\nhis project before the members of the coterie of Federalists in\r\nMassachusetts, which was generally known as the \"Essex Junto.\" As the\r\nconfederacy shaped itself in Pickering's imagination, it would of\r\nnecessity include New York, which would act as a barrier to the\r\ninsidious inroads of Southern Jacobinism; but Massachusetts should\r\ninitiate the movement.\r\n\r\nReplying for his intimates in the Essex Junto, George Cabot put aside\r\nthe project, not as in any wise morally reprehensible,--on the contrary,\r\nhe thought separation desirable,--but as impracticable. The people of\r\nNew England were not aware of their danger and therefore not prepared\r\nfor so radical a movement. The only chance for a successful revolution,\r\nCabot thought, would be \"a war with Great Britain manifestly provoked by\r\nour rulers.\" Pickering and Griswold then turned to New York for support\r\nand to Aaron Burr.\r\n\r\nThe Vice-President was at this time without political influence in the\r\nAdministration, and without credit, either morally or politically. In\r\nNew York, the Livingstons and the Clintons, whom he had mortally\r\noffended, were determined to drive him from the party. At first, Burr\r\nwas inclined to give way: he even applied to the President for an\r\nexecutive appointment; but this resource failing, he determined to fight\r\nhis enemies to the bitter end. In February, 1804, he was nominated for\r\ngovernor by a group of his friends in the legislature, in opposition to\r\nthe Clinton faction. It was well known that many Federalists would\r\nsupport his candidacy. At this crucial moment, Pickering and Griswold\r\nsought out Burr as an ally. As Governor of New York, they intimated, he\r\nwould be in a strategic position and could take the lead in the\r\nsecession of the Northern States. His leadership in the movement, in\r\nshort, was to be the price of Federalist support at the polls. But the\r\nshifty Burr would not commit himself further than to promise an\r\nadministration satisfactory to the Federalists. The conspirators had to\r\nrest content with this vague assurance and to count on Burr's ambition,\r\nand his desire to be revenged upon his enemies, to bind him to their\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Alexander Hamilton was straining every nerve to prevent the\r\nFederalists from indorsing the man who stood in the way of his own\r\nambition and whom he believed to be a dangerous and unprincipled\r\ncharacter. Some vestige of prudence kept the party from committing\r\nitself openly to Burr, but its vote was cast for him. Burr carried his\r\nold stronghold, New York City, but he was beaten elsewhere in the State.\r\nThe hopes of the Federalists were shattered; the conspirators were\r\nconfounded; and the bubble of a Northern Confederacy vanished.\r\n\r\nThe immediate consequences of this political episode were personal.\r\nHamilton had again thwarted the ambitions and incurred the deadly enmity\r\nof an embittered political desperado. A challenge followed and was\r\naccepted. On a summer morning, July 11, 1804, at Weehawken across the\r\nHudson, the rivals faced each other for the last time. Hamilton threw\r\naway his fire: Burr aimed with murderous intent, and Hamilton fell\r\nmortally wounded. From this moment Burr was a marked man and an outcast\r\nfrom respectable society in the East. The newer society of the West,\r\nless sensitive in such matters, thought none the less of a man who had\r\nshot his foe in a fair fight. Thither Burr betook himself when his term\r\nof office expired.\r\n\r\nAs the presidential election approached, the Republicans determined to\r\nprevent any recurrence of the accident which had so nearly seated Burr\r\nin the President's chair. This resolve took the form of a constitutional\r\namendment which provided that presidential electors should designate on\r\ndistinct ballots the persons voted for as President and Vice-President.\r\nTo change the Constitution in this wise was a delicate matter. No part\r\nof the work of the Federal Convention had been more difficult than to\r\nreconcile the small-State party to the mode provided for the election of\r\na President. The final settlement had been accepted only in the\r\nexpectation that in most cases the electoral college would fail to\r\nelect, and that a choice would then be made by the House of\r\nRepresentatives, where the small States would have an equal voice with\r\nthe large States. To remove the chances of an election by the House was\r\nto upset the original compromise and to increase the importance of the\r\nlarge States in the initial election.\r\n\r\nAnother consequence would follow the proposed change. The office of\r\nVice-President would be degraded. Roger Griswold clearly foresaw this\r\neventuality. \"The office will generally be carried into the market,\"\r\nsaid he, \"to be exchanged for the votes of some large States for\r\nPresident; and the only criterion which will be regarded as a\r\nqualification for the office of Vice-President will be the temporary\r\ninfluence of the candidate over the electors of his State.\"\r\nNotwithstanding these and many less obvious objections, the amendment\r\nwas adopted by a party vote in Congress and promptly ratified by\r\nthirteen out of the sixteen States before the fall elections.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1804 was uneventful. The congressional caucus of the\r\nRepublican party dropped Burr as a candidate and nominated George\r\nClinton, of New York. Jefferson was the unanimous choice of his party.\r\nThe depressed Federalists supported Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, of\r\nSouth Carolina, and Rufus King, of New York, as their candidates.\r\nJefferson was triumphantly reelected with the loss of only two States,\r\nConnecticut and Delaware, and of two electoral votes in Maryland. Well\r\nmight he exult at the discomfiture of his enemies. \"The two parties,\" he\r\nwrote to Volney, \"are almost melted into one.\"\r\n\r\n[Map: The Yazoo-Georgia Land Controversy]\r\n\r\nBelow the calm surface of Republican politics, however, dangerous\r\ncounter-currents swirled. For a time the controversy over the Yazoo land\r\nclaims seemed likely to be a reef on which Republican unity would be\r\nshattered. Both the United States and Georgia laid claim to the great\r\nWestern tract which is now occupied by the States of Mississippi and\r\nAlabama. But Georgia with a stronger _prima facie_ case evinced little\r\nregard for the claims of the Federal Government. In 1795, while a mania\r\nfor land speculation was sweeping over the country, the legislature\r\nyielded to corrupt influences and sold some thirty-five million acres in\r\nthe disputed territory for the sum of $500,000 to four land companies.\r\nIn the following year, the people of Georgia rose in their wrath, turned\r\nout the corrupt legislators, and forced the passage of a rescinding act.\r\nMeantime, sales had been made by the Yazoo speculators to guileless\r\npurchasers, who now appealed to Congress for relief. In 1798, Congress\r\nenacted a law providing for commissioners who should confer with Georgia\r\nregarding these conflicting claims. At the same time the Territory of\r\nMississippi was organized.\r\n\r\nSuch was the status of the Yazoo land claims when Jefferson became\r\nPresident. It fell to him to appoint the federal commissioners. They\r\nwrestled manfully with the perplexing details of the controversy, and in\r\n1802 reported what they believed to be a fair settlement of the claims\r\nof all parties. Georgia was to cede her Western lands to the United\r\nStates in return for a payment of $1,250,000 and an agreement on the\r\npart of the Federal Government to extinguish all Indian titles within\r\nher limits as soon as might be. In the course of time this Western\r\nterritory was to be admitted as a State. Five million acres were to be\r\nset aside to satisfy the claims of those who had suffered loss by the\r\nrescinding act of Georgia.\r\n\r\nThe morbid imagination of John Randolph could see nothing but jobbery in\r\nthis proposal to satisfy claims which had been fraudulently obtained\r\nfrom the Legislature of Georgia. There can be little doubt that\r\nRandolph's hatred for Madison, who was a member of the federal\r\ncommission, influenced his subsequent action. On two occasions, in 1804\r\nand again in 1805, he assailed the proposed compromise, and twice he\r\nsecured a postponement, though he could not defeat the bill which\r\nembodied the conclusions of the commission. From this time on Randolph\r\nwas never more than an uncertain ally of the Administration. The few\r\npoliticians who still followed his lead were styled rather\r\ncontemptuously \"Quids.\" Even Republicans with slender classical training\r\ngrasped the significance of a _tertium quid_. Yet Randolph was still a\r\npower in the House.\r\n\r\nThe Yazoo affair dragged on for years. In 1810, a decision of the\r\nSupreme Court gave aid and comfort to the opposition. In the case of\r\n_Fletcher_ v. _Peck_, the court held that the original Act of 1795,\r\nconveying the Yazoo grants, was a contract within the meaning of the\r\nConstitution which might not be impaired by subsequent legislation. It\r\nwas not until 1814 that Congress voted $8,000,000 to the claimants under\r\nthis act and so settled one of the most obstinate controversies in the\r\nhistory of Congress.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1805, Jefferson seemed about to realize what had been the\r\nobject of his diplomatic endeavors ever since the acquisition of\r\nLouisiana. Intimations came from Talleyrand that the Floridas might be\r\nobtained by purchase if the United States would prevail upon Spain to\r\nrefer the whole dispute to Napoleon. On December 3, 1805, he sent a\r\nmessage to Congress which seemed to break completely with all\r\nJeffersonian precedents. It recounted the failure of negotiations with\r\nSpain, and spoke sternly of the depredations committed in the new\r\nTerritories by Spanish officers and soldiers. The Administration had\r\nfound it necessary to order the troops on the frontier to be in\r\nreadiness to repel future aggressions. Some of the injuries committed\r\nadmitted of a peaceable remedy. Some of them were \"of a nature to be met\r\nby force only, and all of them may lead to it.\" Coupled with these\r\nadmonitions were suggestions for the fortification of seaports, the\r\nbuilding of war-vessels, and the organization of the militia.\r\n\r\nComing from the pen of one who had written that peace was his passion\r\nand who had hitherto avoided war with Quaker-like submission, this\r\nmessage caused bewilderment on all sides. The West, however, took the\r\nPresident literally and looked forward with enthusiasm to a war which\r\nwas bound to end in the overthrow of Spanish dominion in the Southwest.\r\nThree days later a secret message was delivered to the House of\r\nRepresentatives announcing that Spain was disposed to effect a\r\nsettlement \"so comprehensive as to remove as far as possible the grounds\r\nof future collision and controversy on the eastern as well as the\r\nwestern side of the Mississippi.\" Only a show of force was needed \"to\r\nadvance the object of peace.\"\r\n\r\nRandolph for one was thoroughly disgusted by \"this double set of\r\nopinions and principles\"; and his ill-temper gave vent to biting\r\ninvective when he learned, that as chairman of the Committee of Ways and\r\nMeans he was expected to propose an appropriation of $2,000,000 for the\r\npurchase of Florida. He refused flatly to assume the responsibility \"of\r\ndelivering the public purse to the first cut-throat that demanded it,\"\r\nfor Madison had said in private conversation that the money was destined\r\nfor Napoleon. The opposition of Randolph caused weeks of delay. It was\r\nnot until March 13 that Madison could authorize Armstrong, minister to\r\nFrance, to offer $5,000,000 for Florida and Texas. It was then too\r\nlate. Either Armstrong had been misled or Napoleon had changed his mind:\r\nin either case, the favorable moment had passed. The purchase of Florida\r\nwas indefinitely deferred.\r\n\r\nDuring these months, when relations with Spain were strained to the\r\nbreaking point, Aaron Burr was weaving the strands of one of the most\r\nintricate and baffling intrigues in American history. Shortly after\r\nrelinquishing the office of Vice-President, Burr undertook an extensive\r\ntour through the West. In the course of his voyage down the Ohio he\r\nlanded on Blennerhassett's Island, which an eccentric Irish gentleman of\r\nthat name had transformed into an estate. At Cincinnati he was the guest\r\nof Senator John Smith; and there he met also Jonathan Dayton, who had\r\njust finished his term as Senator from New Jersey. Both of these\r\nindividuals played an uncertain part in Burr's plans. At Nashville he\r\nvisited General Andrew Jackson; at Fort Massac he spent four days in\r\nclose conference with General James Wilkinson, who was in command of the\r\nWestern army--one of the most precious rascals in the annals of the\r\ncountry; and at New Orleans he put himself in touch with the Mexican\r\nAssociation, which had been formed by ardent individuals who looked\r\nforward to war with Spain and the liberation of Mexico.\r\n\r\nTo men like Andrew Jackson and Daniel Clark, of New Orleans, whose\r\nloyalty is beyond question, Burr announced his purpose to devote his\r\nlife to the overthrow of the Spanish power in America. It was a mission\r\nwhich commended itself to the Spanish-hating people of the Mississippi\r\nValley. Western newspapers announced that he meditated some\r\nextraordinary enterprise; and one editor hinted that he was plotting a\r\nrevolution which would end in the formation of a separate government for\r\nthe region bordering on the Ohio and the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nReturning to the East, Burr left no stone unturned in his efforts to\r\nfind funds to finance this mysterious enterprise. He was in conference\r\nwith Merry, the British minister, and with Yrujo, the Spanish minister;\r\nand each received a different impression as to the scope of his plans.\r\nAt one time Burr talked madly of seizing the government at Washington.\r\nThe kaleidoscopic changes of his plans baffle consistent explanation.\r\nOne thing only is clear: he needed funds. These he obtained in part from\r\nhis son-in-law, Joseph Alston, a wealthy planter in South Carolina, and\r\nin part from the credulous Blennerhassett, who was persuaded to purchase\r\na million acres on the Washita River in northern Louisiana. Thither the\r\nexpedition which started out from Blennerhassett's Island was ostensibly\r\ndirected. How far Burr's plans went beyond the occupation of this tract\r\nis a matter of conjecture. One of Blennerhassett's servants may\r\ninadvertently have told the truth when he said that they were \"going to\r\ntake Mexico, one of the finest and richest places in the whole world.\"\r\n\r\nIf Burr seriously contemplated a filibustering expedition against\r\nMexico, he was favored by circumstances. Spanish troops had taken up a\r\nposition east of the Sabine River, on what was American soil; and only\r\nan overt act was needed to precipitate war. Every frontiersman was\r\npreparing for a tussle with the hated Spaniard. In the event of war Burr\r\nknew well enough that an expedition against Mexico would be countenanced\r\nby the government at Washington. Whether or no war with Spain would\r\noccur depended upon the cooperation of General Wilkinson, for he had\r\nbeen charged by the Secretary of War to take command of the troops at\r\nNew Orleans with as little delay as possible and \"to repel any invasion\r\nof the territory of the United States east of the river Sabine, or north\r\nand west of the bounds of what has been called West Florida.\"\r\n\r\nThe delay of Wilkinson in following these orders of May 6, 1806, has\r\nbeen explained on the supposition that he was awaiting the development\r\nof Burr's plans. Be that as it may, his hesitation was fatal to the\r\nconspirators. On September 27, the Spanish troops retired beyond the\r\nSabine, thus removing an excellent pretext for war. From this time on\r\nWilkinson's hand is against Burr. His conduct is enveloped in an\r\natmosphere of intrigue. At one moment he is sending alarmist dispatches\r\nto the President, warning him against a mysterious expedition which was\r\nbeing prepared--by what authority he professed not to know--against the\r\nSpanish province of Mexico; at the next moment he is intriguing with the\r\nSpanish authorities, warning them against Burr and assuring them of his\r\nprotection. This valuable information Wilkinson thought was worth about\r\n$111,000; but his aid-de-camp seems to have returned empty-handed from\r\nthe City of Mexico. His further exploits in New Orleans, which he kept\r\nin a state of perpetual alarm and finally put under martial law, read\r\nlike a chapter from a melodrama.\r\n\r\nIt was not until October, 1806, that President Jefferson expressed any\r\nserious concern about Burr's intrigues. Even then he concluded to send\r\nonly a confidential agent to watch the conspirator and to arrest him if\r\nnecessary. In November, dispatches from Wilkinson convinced the\r\nPresident of the need of more summary action. On November 27, he issued\r\na proclamation, stating that sundry persons were confederating and\r\nconspiring together to begin a military expedition or enterprise against\r\nthe dominions of Spain. Honest and well-meaning citizens were being\r\nseduced under various pretenses to engage in the criminal enterprises of\r\nthese men. All faithful citizens and the civil and military authorities\r\nwere therefore enjoined to be vigilant in preventing the expedition and\r\nin bringing the conspirators to punishment.\r\n\r\nThe President's proclamation wrought a transformation in the temper of\r\nthe West. People reasoned that the danger must be greater than any one\r\nhad suspected. The newspapers began to print wild stories. The\r\nLegislature of Ohio authorized the governor to take proper measures to\r\nprevent acts hostile to the United States. The governor promptly seized\r\nthe bateaux which were being constructed at Marietta and called out the\r\nmilitia to overpower Blennerhassett and his followers. On the Virginia\r\nside of the river, the militia were in readiness for a descent upon the\r\nisland. On the night of December 10, Blennerhassett and a handful of men\r\nleft the island in such boats as they could find. Wild rumors followed\r\nthe expedition as it floated peacefully down the Ohio. The _Western Spy_\r\ntold its readers that Blennerhassett had passed Cincinnati in keel boats\r\nloaded with military stores; that more were to follow; and that twenty\r\nthousand men had been enlisted in an expedition against Mexico.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Burr had met with embarrassing delays. The promised recruits\r\nhad not come in, since war had not been declared. Only two of the five\r\nboats which Jackson had agreed to build were ready. Nevertheless, Burr\r\nleft Nashville on December 23, as he had planned, and on the next day\r\njoined Blennerhassett at the mouth of the Cumberland. The combined\r\nstrength of this flotilla which was causing such public consternation\r\nwas nine bateaux, carrying less than sixty men.\r\n\r\nThe voyage of the expedition down the Ohio and the Mississippi was\r\nwithout incident until January 10, when the expedition put into Bayou\r\nPierre, in the Mississippi Territory. There Burr was put under arrest\r\nand brought before a grand jury. Luck again favored him. As in Kentucky,\r\nso here the jurors failed to find any ground for indictment.\r\nNevertheless, the judge bound Burr over to appear from day to day.\r\nHolding this proceeding unauthorized by law, Burr forfeited his bond and\r\nmade his escape; but near Fort Stoddert, he was again apprehended. On\r\nMarch 5, 1807, he was sent with a guard of six men from Fort Stoddert to\r\nRichmond, Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe commitment, indictment, and trial of Aaron Burr form a fittingly\r\ninconclusive sequel to a strange tale of intrigue and misadventure. Not\r\nmerely the fate of the accused man, but the personalities involved, gave\r\na spectacular character to the legal proceedings at Richmond. Arrayed as\r\ncounsel on the side of Burr were three notable attorneys from Virginia,\r\nand Luther Martin of Maryland. The foreman of the grand jury was John\r\nRandolph. The chief witness for the prosecution was General Wilkinson.\r\nThe presiding judge was Chief Justice John Marshall, within whose\r\ncircuit Blennerhassett's Island lay. And behind the prosecution,\r\nstraining every nerve to secure the conviction of the conspirators, was\r\nPresident Thomas Jefferson.\r\n\r\nFrom first to last the Chief Justice made the task of the prosecution\r\nexceedingly difficult by a rigorous definition of treason. Treason\r\ninvolved an overt act, he insisted; the actual levying of war by an\r\nassembling of armed men. To convict of treason, the testimony of two\r\nwitnesses was required by the Constitution. Now, Burr was hundreds of\r\nmiles away from Blennerhassett's Island when the alleged overt act of\r\ntreason was committed. The court would not admit any testimony relative\r\nto the conduct and declarations of Burr elsewhere and subsequent to the\r\ntransactions on Blennerhassett's Island. Such testimony was in its\r\nnature merely corroborative, the Chief Justice ruled, and inadequate to\r\nprove the overt act in itself, and therefore irrelevant until the overt\r\nact was proved by the testimony of two witnesses. On September 1, the\r\nprosecution abandoned the case, and the jury returned a verdict of not\r\nguilty. The Government now sought to secure the conviction of Burr on\r\nthe charge of misdemeanor; but less than a week was needed to reveal the\r\nweakness of the testimony put forward by the prosecution. On September\r\n15, Burr was again acquitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n     BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\r\n\r\n     The New England conspiracy, the Yazoo controversy, and the\r\n     intrigues of Burr, are admirably recounted by Henry Adams. His\r\n     account may be corrected at various points, however, by consulting\r\n     W. F. McCaleb, _The Aaron Burr Conspiracy_ (1903). A brief account\r\n     of the intrigues and plots of this time may be found in Channing,\r\n     _The Jeffersonian System, 1801-1811_ (1906). The intrigues of the\r\n     Federalists in New England have been described recently with new\r\n     information by S. E. Morison, _Life and Letters of Harrison Gray\r\n     Otis_ (2 vols., 1913). Other biographies of importance are H. C.\r\n     Lodge, _Life and Letters of George Cabot_ (1877); James Parton,\r\n     _Life and Times of Aaron Burr_ (1858); J. S. Bassett, _Life of\r\n     Andrew Jackson_ (2 vols., 1911). The trial of Burr is described in\r\n     popular fashion by F. T. Hill, _Decisive Battles of the Law_\r\n     (1907). The origin and subsequent history of the Yazoo affair may\r\n     be traced in C. H. Haskins, \"The Yazoo Land Companies\" (in the\r\n     _American Historical Association Papers_, 1891).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nPEACEABLE COERCION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe so-called Peace of Amiens in 1801 proved to be only an interlude in\r\nthe wars of France with Europe. Within two years hostilities were\r\nrenewed which closed only with the battle of Waterloo. In the course of\r\nthis prolonged conflict Napoleon won and lost for France the ascendency\r\nin central and western Europe, but Great Britain remained throughout\r\nmistress of the seas. The commerce of France and of Holland and Spain,\r\nwhich had become virtually her dependencies, was almost driven from the\r\nseas. For their foodstuffs and colonial supplies, more than ever in\r\ndemand as war devastated the fields of Europe, these nations had to look\r\nto vessels flying neutral flags. The export trade of the United States,\r\nwhich had fallen from $94,000,000 in the year 1801 to $55,800,000 in\r\n1803, rapidly recovered until in 1805 it passed the high-water mark of\r\nthe earlier year. More than half of this trade was in products of the\r\ntropics, for while the direct trade between the West India colonies and\r\nEurope was forbidden by the so-called \"Rule of 1756,\" American shippers\r\ncarried on a lucrative traffic which was virtually direct. Products\r\nbrought from the West Indies to American ports were promptly reshipped\r\nas part of American stock to European ports; and the British courts had\r\nheld that this importation had broken the voyage. When once import\r\nduties had been paid in an American port, the courts refused to inquire\r\nwhat thereafter became of the cargo and whether in fact rebates were\r\ngiven on exportation.\r\n\r\nIn midsummer of 1805 occurred a reversal of British policy. In the case\r\nof the Essex, which had made the voyage from Charleston to London with\r\ncolonial produce from Martinique, a British admiralty court ruled for\r\nthe first time that the payment of import duties was not sufficient\r\nproof of _bona fide_ importation, because of the practice in the United\r\nStates of repaying duties on exportation. Other seizures followed that\r\nof the Essex, to the consternation of American shippers. Insurance rates\r\non cargoes were doubled and doubled again within a year. Early in 1806,\r\nMonroe, then Minister to England, wrote in protest to the British\r\nMinistry that \"about one hundred and twenty vessels had been seized,\r\nseveral condemned, all taken from their course, detained, and otherwise\r\nsubjected to heavy losses and damages.\" But Monroe could not obtain any\r\nconcession of principle or promise of indemnity.\r\n\r\nThe policy which the Secretary of State was known to favor was that of\r\ncoercing England through restrictions upon trade. The implications of\r\nthis policy were suggested by his often-quoted remark touching upon the\r\ndependence of British manufacturers: \"There are three hundred thousand\r\nsouls who live by our custom: let them be driven to poverty and despair,\r\nand what will be the consequences?\" He lost no opportunity to urge upon\r\nhis party associates the need of passing retaliatory legislation\r\nagainst Great Britain. It was well known, of course, that the President\r\nwould support any fair application of his theory of peaceable coercion.\r\n\r\nAt first there was a general disposition to try the effect of an\r\nembargo; but more prudent counsels prevailed when the news of Trafalgar\r\nreached America. Congress finally adopted, in April, 1806, a\r\nnon-importation bill, which was to become effective eight months later.\r\nThere was some point to Randolph's criticism when he declared it to be\r\n\"a milk-and-water Bill. A dose of chicken broth to be taken nine months\r\nhence\"; for the act prohibited only the importation of such English\r\ngoods as could be manufactured in the United States or procured\r\nelsewhere. Such a measure was not likely to make the manufacturers of\r\nEngland quail. In the mean time, the Administration was to accomplish\r\nwhat it might by direct negotiation with the British Ministry, using\r\nthis Nicholson Act as a covert threat. Much against his will, Jefferson\r\nhad to nominate another envoy to act with Monroe. His choice fell upon\r\nWilliam Pinkney, of Maryland. The friends of Madison were not unwilling\r\nto humiliate Monroe, whose presidential aspirations might interfere with\r\nMadison's succession, for Jefferson had let it be known as early as the\r\nsummer of 1805 that he did not seek a reelection.\r\n\r\nA few days after Congress adjourned occurred the Leander episode. This\r\nfrigate was one of several British war vessels whose presence in\r\nAmerican waters was a constant menace to merchantmen and an insult to\r\nthe National Government. From time to time they appeared off Sandy Hook,\r\nlying in wait for American vessels which were suspected of carrying\r\nBritish seamen who had fled from the hard conditions of service on ships\r\nof war. An American merchantman was likely at any time to be stopped by\r\na shot across her bow and to be subjected to the humiliation of a visit\r\nfrom a search crew. On April 25, 1806, the Leander, in rounding up a\r\nmerchantman, fired a shot which killed the helmsman of a passing\r\ncoasting sloop. The incident or accident threatened to assume the\r\nproportions of a _casus belli_.\r\n\r\nThe practice of impressment was an old grievance which seemed to\r\nAmericans devoid of any justification. From the British point of view\r\nthere was much to be said in extenuation of the practice. It should not\r\nbe forgotten that Great Britain was locked in a life-and-death struggle\r\nwith a mighty antagonist, and that she had need of every able seaman.\r\nOwing to the rigorous life on board of men-of-war, every ship's crew was\r\nlikely to be depleted by desertions whenever she touched at an American\r\nport. Jack Tar found life much more agreeable on an American\r\nmerchantman; and he rarely failed to procure the needful naturalization\r\npapers or certificates which would give him a claim to American\r\ncitizenship. The right of expatriation was not at this time conceded by\r\nthe British Government. Once an Englishman, always an Englishman.\r\nSurely, then, British commanders might claim their own seamen on the\r\nhigh seas. Officially, at least, they never claimed the right to impress\r\nAmerican seamen. Yet where differences of speech were so slight, the\r\nprovocation so strong, and the needs of the navy so great, search crews\r\nwere not always careful to distinguish between Britishers and Yankees.\r\n\r\nThe United States never admitted the justice of these claims. To concede\r\nthe right of search on the high seas was to admit a vast extension of\r\nBritish jurisdiction. As early as 1792, Jefferson had stated the\r\nprinciple for which the United States had consistently contended: \"The\r\nsimplest rule will be that the vessel being American shall be evidence\r\nthat the seamen on board of her are such.\" The principle was never\r\naccepted by any British ministry. The practice of impressment continued\r\nto harass each succeeding administration. In 1806, a crisis seemed at\r\nhand. Madison reported to the House of Representatives the names of nine\r\nhundred and thirteen persons who appeared to have been impressed from\r\nAmerican vessels. How many of these were British deserters under\r\nAmerican names, it is impossible to say. The number reported by Madison\r\nis at least an index to the sense of injury which the nation felt.\r\n\r\nWhen President Jefferson sent Pinkney to join Monroe in securing a\r\ncomprehensive treaty with Great Britain, which should restore West India\r\ntrade to its old condition and provide indemnity for the American\r\nvessels condemned in the admiralty courts, he set down, as a _sine qua\r\nnon_ in his instructions, the renunciation by the British Government of\r\nthe practice of impressment. It was an ultimatum which expressed a truly\r\nnational feeling; but with the consciousness of power which the\r\ndomination of the high seas gave, the British commissioners treated\r\nthis ultimatum, somewhat contemptuously, as an impossible and\r\nunwarranted demand. The American mission should have ended then and\r\nthere; but on obtaining assurances that greater care would be exercised\r\nin impressing seamen, Monroe and Pinkney determined to disregard their\r\ninstructions. Negotiations were continued and culminated in a treaty,\r\nDecember 1, 1806, which ran counter to the injunctions of the President\r\nin every particular. He refused to submit the document to the Senate.\r\nNevertheless, he permitted Madison to draft new instructions for the\r\ncommissioners, in the hope that the treaty could be made a basis for\r\nfurther negotiations. While these new instructions were crossing the\r\nocean, a disaster occurred which brought the United States and Great\r\nBritain to the verge of war.\r\n\r\nIn the early months of 1807, some French frigates had run up Chesapeake\r\nBay to escape a British squadron. Relying on what Jefferson pleasantly\r\ntermed the hospitality of the United States, these British men-of-war\r\ndropped anchor in Lynnhaven Bay, near Cape Henry, where they could watch\r\nthe passage through the capes. From one of these British vessels a boat\r\ncrew of common seamen made their escape to Norfolk. Just at this time\r\nthe new frigate Chesapeake, which had been partially fitted out at the\r\nnavy yard at Washington for service in the Mediterranean, dropped down\r\nto Hampton Roads to receive her complement of guns and provisions for a\r\nthree years' cruise.\r\n\r\n[Map: Tonnage of the United States 1807]\r\n\r\nOn June 22, the Chesapeake passed out through the capes, preceded by the\r\nLeopard, a British frigate of fifty guns. When they were well out on\r\nthe high seas, the Leopard drew alongside the Chesapeake and signaled\r\nthat she had a message for Commodore Barron. This message proved to be\r\nan order from Admiral Berkeley at Halifax, instructing commanders of\r\nBritish vessels who fell in with the Chesapeake to search her for\r\ndeserters. The American commander denied that he had deserters on board\r\nand refused to allow the search. Almost immediately the Leopard\r\napproached with her gundecks cleared for action. Unaware of his danger\r\nCommodore Barron had not called his crew to quarters. The Leopard opened\r\nfire and poured three broadsides into the helpless American vessel,\r\nkilling three men and wounding eighteen others. After fifteen minutes\r\nBarron hauled down his flag to spare his crew from needless sacrifice,\r\nand suffered the British commander to search the dismantled Chesapeake.\r\nFour alleged deserters were found and taken away, three of whom\r\nsubsequently were proved to be American citizens. The Leopard then\r\nreturned to the squadron off Cape Henry, while the Chesapeake limped\r\nback to Hampton Roads.\r\n\r\nHad the President chosen to go to war at this moment, he would have had\r\na united people behind him. But Thomas Jefferson was not a martial\r\ncharacter. His proclamation ordering all armed British vessels out of\r\nAmerican waters and suspending intercourse with them if they remained,\r\nwas so moderate in tone as to seem almost pusillanimous. John Randolph\r\ncalled it an apology. Instead of demanding unconditional reparation for\r\nthis outrage, Madison instructed Monroe to insist upon an entire\r\nabolition of impressments as \"an indispensable part of the\r\nsatisfaction.\" The astute Canning, who had become Foreign Secretary in\r\nthe new Portland Ministry, took advantage of this confusion of issues to\r\nevade the demand for reparation until popular passion in the United\r\nStates had subsided. It was not until November that Canning took active\r\nmeasures. He then sent a special commissioner to the United States in\r\nthe person of George Rose.\r\n\r\nThe instructions which Rose carried with him to Washington, in January,\r\n1808, were anything but conciliatory. As a preliminary to any\r\nnegotiations, he was to demand the recall of the President's\r\nproclamation of July 2, and an explicit disavowal of Commodore Barron's\r\nconduct in encouraging desertion from His Majesty's navy. The United\r\nStates was also to give assurances that it would prevent the recurrence\r\nof such causes as had provoked the display of force by Admiral Berkeley.\r\nThat the Administration should have continued negotiations after the\r\nfull purport of these instructions was disclosed, seems incredible; but\r\nit was not until the middle of February that Madison awoke to the fact\r\nthat the United States was being invited to \"make as it were an\r\nexpiatory sacrifice to obtain redress.\" Yet another month passed before\r\nRose was given to understand that his mission was futile. By this time\r\npublic attention was engrossed in the contest for neutral rights.\r\n\r\nBefore the close of the year 1806, Napoleon was master of central Europe\r\nand in a position to deal his premeditated blow at the commercial\r\nascendency of England. A fortnight after the terrible overthrow of\r\nPrussia at Jena, he made a triumphal entry into Berlin. From this city\r\nhe issued, on November 21, the famous decree which was his answer to the\r\nBritish blockade of the continent. Since the British had determined to\r\nruin neutral commerce by an illegal blockade, so the preamble read,\r\n\"whoever deals on the continent in English merchandise favors that\r\ndesign and becomes an accomplice.\" All English goods henceforth were to\r\nbe lawful prize in any territory held by the troops of France or her\r\nallies. The British Isles were declared to be in a state of blockade.\r\nEvery American or other neutral vessel going to or coming from the\r\nBritish Isles, therefore, was subject to capture.\r\n\r\nThe British Ministry took up the gauntlet. An order in council of\r\nJanuary 7, 1807, forbade neutral trade between ports under the control\r\nof France or her allies; a second order, November 11, closed to neutrals\r\nthose European ports under French control \"as if the same were actually\r\nblockaded,\" but permitted vessels which first entered a British port and\r\npaid port duties to sail to any continental port. Only one more blow\r\nseemed needed to complete the ruin of American commerce. It fell a month\r\nlater, December 17, 1807, when Napoleon issued his Milan Decree.\r\nHenceforth any vessel which submitted to be searched by an English\r\ncruiser or which paid any tonnage duty to the British Government or\r\nwhich set sail for any British port was subject to capture and\r\ncondemnation as lawful prize. Such was to be the maritime code \"until\r\nEngland returned to the principles of international law which are also\r\nthose of justice and honor.\"\r\n\r\nAmerican commerce was now, indeed, between the hammer and the anvil. The\r\nNicholson Non-Importation Act, which had been twice suspended and which\r\nhad only just gone into effect (December 14), seemed wholly inadequate\r\nto meet this situation. It had been designed as a coercive measure, to\r\nbe sure, but no one knew precisely to what extent it would affect\r\nEnglish trade. The time had come for the blow which Jefferson and his\r\nadvisers had held in reserve. On December 18, the President sent to\r\nCongress a message recommending \"an immediate inhibition of the\r\ndeparture of our vessels from the ports of the United States.\" The\r\nSenate responded by passing a bill (which Jefferson probably drafted)\r\nthrough its three stages in a single day; the House passed the measure\r\nafter only two days of debate; and on December 22, the Embargo Act\r\nreceived the President's signature.\r\n\r\nThe temper of those who supported the embargo was reflected by Senator\r\nAdams, of Massachusetts, who was reported to have said: \"The President\r\nhas recommended the measure on his high responsibility. I would not\r\nconsider, I would not deliberate; I would act.\" Yet there were members\r\nof Congress who were not prepared to accept the high authority of the\r\nPresident. The vote in the House of Representatives indicates that\r\nopinion was divided in Adams's own State. Boston with its environs and\r\nthe interior counties were opposed to the embargo. New York was also\r\ndivided, though here the commercial areas favored the measure. Maryland\r\nshowed a like division of opinion. Connecticut was a unit in opposing\r\nthe President's policy.\r\n\r\nWhat was the measure which was accepted almost without discussion on\r\n\"the high responsibility\" of the President? So far as it was defended at\r\nall, it was presented as a measure for the protection of American ships,\r\nmerchandise, and seamen. It forbade the departure of all ships and\r\nvessels in the ports of the United States for any foreign port, except\r\nvessels under the immediate direction of the President. Foreign armed\r\nvessels were exempted as a matter of course from the operation of this\r\nact; so also were all vessels in ballast or already loaded with goods at\r\nthe time when the act was passed. Coasting vessels were to give bonds\r\ndouble the value of vessel and cargo to re-land their goods, wares, or\r\nmerchandise in some port of the United States.\r\n\r\nAmerican shippers were so little appreciative of the protection offered\r\nby a benevolent Government that they evaded the embargo from the very\r\nfirst. Foreign trade was lucrative in just the proportion that it was\r\nhazardous. If some skippers obeyed, the profits were so much the greater\r\nfor the less conscientious. Under guise of engaging in the coasting\r\ntrade, many a ship's captain with the connivance of the owner landed his\r\ncargo in a foreign port. A brisk traffic also sprang up by land across\r\nthe Canadian border.\r\n\r\n[Map: House Vote on the Embargo December 21, 1807]\r\n\r\nAll pretense that the embargo was designed to protect American commerce\r\nhad now to be abandoned. Jefferson did not attempt to disguise his\r\npurpose to use the embargo as a great coercive weapon against France and\r\nGreat Britain. Congress passed supplementary acts and suffered the\r\nPresident to exercise a vast discretionary power which was strangely at\r\nvariance with Republican traditions. \"When you are doubtful,\" wrote the\r\nPresident with reference to coasting vessels, \"consider me as voting for\r\ndetention.\" \"We find it necessary,\" he informed the governors of the\r\nStates, \"to consider every vessel as suspicious which has on board any\r\narticle of domestic produce in demand at foreign markets.\" Governors of\r\nthose States which consumed more wheat than they produced were to issue\r\ncertificates to collectors of ports stating the amount desired. The\r\ncollectors in turn were to authorize merchants in whom they had\r\nconfidence to import the needed supplies. Nor did the President hesitate\r\nto put whole communities under the ban when individual shipowners were\r\nsuspected of engaging in illicit trade. He so far forgot his horror of a\r\nstanding army that he asked Congress for an addition to the regular army\r\nof six thousand men. Congress had already made an appropriation of\r\n$850,000 to build gunboats. It now appropriated a million and a quarter\r\nfor fortifications and for the equipment of the militia.\r\n\r\nThrough the long summer of 1808, President Jefferson waited anxiously\r\nfor the effects of coercion to appear. The reports from abroad were not\r\nencouraging. The effects of the embargo upon English economy are even\r\nnow a matter of conjecture. In the opinion of Mr. Henry Adams, the\r\nembargo only fattened the shipowners and squires who devised the orders\r\nin council, and lowered the wages and moral standard of the laboring\r\nclasses by cutting off temporarily the importation of foodstuffs and the\r\nraw material for British manufacturers. When Pinkney approached Canning\r\nwith the proposal that England should revoke her orders upon the\r\nwithdrawal of the embargo, he was told, with biting sarcasm, that \"if it\r\nwere possible to make any sacrifice for the repeal of the embargo\r\nwithout appearing to deprecate it as a measure of hostility, he [His\r\nMajesty] would gladly have facilitated its removal as a measure of\r\ninconvenient restriction upon the American people.\" The blow aimed at\r\nGreat Britain had missed its mark.\r\n\r\nFrom the first Napoleon had welcomed the embargo as a measure likely to\r\ncontribute to the success of his continental system. On April 17, 1808,\r\nhe issued a decree from Bayonne ordering the seizure of all American\r\nvessels in French ports. It was argued ingeniously that since they were\r\nabroad in violation of the embargo, they were not _bona fide_ American\r\nvessels, but presumptively British, and therefore subject to capture. To\r\naccept the aid of the French Emperor in enforcing a policy which was\r\nintended to coerce his action, was humiliating to the last degree.\r\nArmstrong wrote to Madison that in his opinion the coercive force of the\r\nembargo had been overrated. \"Here it is not felt, and in England ... it\r\nis forgotten.\"\r\n\r\nThe importance of the embargo, Jefferson never tired of repeating, was\r\nnot to be measured in money. If the brutalities of war and the\r\ncorruption incident to war could be avoided by this alternative, the\r\nexperiment was well worth trying. Yet Jefferson himself was startled by\r\nthe deliberate and systematic evasions of the law. \"I did not expect,\"\r\nhe confessed, \"a crop of so sudden and rank growth of fraud and open\r\nopposition by force could have grown up in the United States.\" Moreover,\r\nthe cost of the embargo was very great. The value of exports fell from\r\n$108,000,000 in 1807 to $22,000,000 in the following year. The national\r\nrevenue from import duties was cut down by one half.\r\n\r\nThe embargo bore down with crushing weight upon New England, where\r\nnearly one third of the ships engaged in the carrying trade were owned.\r\nThe shipbuilding industry languished, as well as all the industries\r\nsubsidiary to commerce. Even the farmers suffered as the embargo\r\ncontinued. A temporary loss of their market could have been borne with\r\nsome degree of equanimity, but not an indefinite loss, for imported\r\ngoods now began to rise in price, adding to the general distress.\r\n\r\nThe economic distress of New England, however, cannot be measured by the\r\nvolume of indignant protest. The Federalist machine never worked more\r\neffectively than when it directed this unrest and diverted it to\r\npartisan purposes. Thomas Jefferson's embargo was made to seem a\r\nvindictive assault upon New England. The Essex Junto, with Timothy\r\nPickering as leader, spared no pains to convince the unthinking that\r\nJefferson was the tool or the dupe of Napoleon, who was bent upon\r\ncoercing the United States into war with Great Britain. The spring\r\nelection of 1808 gave the measure of this reaction in Massachusetts. The\r\nFederalists regained control of both houses of the state legislature,\r\nand forced the resignation of Senator John Quincy Adams, who had broken\r\nwith his party by voting for the embargo, and who had incurred the\r\nundying enmity of of the Essex Junto by defending the policy of the\r\nAdministration.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of what Jefferson called \"the general factiousness,\"\r\nfollowing the embargo, occurred a presidential election. Jefferson was\r\nnot a candidate for reelection. His fondest hope now was that he might\r\nbe allowed to retire with honor to the bosom of his family. Upon whom\r\nwould his mantle fall? Madison was his probable preference; and Madison\r\nhad the doubtful advantage of a formal nomination by the regular\r\ncongressional caucus of the party. But Monroe still considered his\r\nchances of election good; and Vice-President George Clinton also\r\nannounced his candidacy. Both Monroe and Clinton represented those\r\nelements of opposition which harassed the closing months of the\r\nAdministration. Contrary to expectation, the Federalists did not ally\r\nthemselves with Clinton, but preferred to go down in defeat under their\r\nold leaders, Charles C. Pinckney and Rufus King. With the opposition\r\nthus divided, Madison scored an easy victory; but against him was the\r\nalmost solid vote of a section. All the New England States but Vermont\r\ncast their electoral votes for the Federalist candidates.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the year the failure of the embargo was patent to\r\nevery fair-minded observer. The alternatives, war or submission, were\r\nnot pleasant to contemplate. From force of habit the party in power\r\nlooked to Jefferson for leadership; but since Madison's election, he had\r\nassumed the role of \"unmeddling listener,\" not wishing to commit his\r\nsuccessor to any policy. The abdication of Jefferson thus left the party\r\nwithout a leader and without a program at a most critical moment.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances it was easier to continue the embargo than to\r\nface the probability of war. Gallatin had already urged the need of more\r\nstringent laws for the enforcement of the embargo,--laws which he\r\nadmitted were both odious and dangerous. On January 9, 1809, Congress\r\npassed the desired legislation. Thereafter coasting vessels were obliged\r\nto give bonds to six times the value of vessel and cargo before they\r\nwere permitted to load. Collectors were authorized to refuse permission\r\nif in their opinion there was \"an intention to violate the embargo.\"\r\nOnly loss at sea released a shipowner from his bond. In suits at law\r\nneither capture nor any other accident could be pleaded. Collectors at\r\nthe ports and on the frontiers were authorized to seize goods which were\r\n\"apparently on their way toward the territory of a foreign nation.\" And\r\nfor such seizures the collectors were not liable in courts of law. The\r\narmy, the navy, and the militia were put at their disposal.\r\n\r\nThe \"Force Act\" was the last straw for the Federalists of Massachusetts.\r\nTown after town adopted resolutions which ran through the whole gamut of\r\npartisan abuse. The General Court of Massachusetts resolved that it\r\nwould cooperate with other States in procuring such amendments to the\r\nConstitution as were necessary to obtain protection for commerce and to\r\ngive to the commercial States \"their fair and just consideration in the\r\ngovernment of the Union.\" Governor Trumbull, of Connecticut, flatly\r\ndeclined to allow the militia to assist the collectors in the\r\nenforcement of the embargo, holding that the act to enforce the embargo\r\nwas unconstitutional, \"interfering with the state sovereignties, and\r\nsubversive of the guaranteed rights, privileges, and immunities of the\r\ncitizens of the United States.\" The legislature rallied to the support\r\nof the governor with resolutions which breathe much the same spirit as\r\nthe Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions of 1798.\r\n\r\nThe incessant bombardment by the New England towns was too much for\r\nJefferson's equanimity. \"I felt the foundation of the government shaken\r\nunder my feet by the New England townships,\" he said in after years. His\r\ncontrol over his own party was gone. Northern Republicans combined with\r\nFederalists to force the repeal of the embargo through Congress; and on\r\nMarch 1, 1809, with much bitterness of spirit, Jefferson signed the bill\r\nthat terminated his great experiment. Instead of interdicting commerce\r\naltogether, Congress suspended intercourse with France and Great Britain\r\nafter March 15 and until one or the other of the offenders repealed its\r\nobnoxious orders. Meantime, American vessels were free to pick up what\r\ntrade they could with other nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n     BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\r\n\r\n     The historical writings of Henry Adams are indispensable aids to\r\n     an understanding of the foreign policy of Jefferson. On the effect\r\n     of the embargo, Channing, _The Jeffersonian System_, takes sharp\r\n     issue with Adams. There is a mass of valuable data on social\r\n     history in the third volume of McMaster, _History of the People of\r\n     the United States_. E. L. Bogart, _Economic History of the United\r\n     States_ (1913); Katherine Coman, _Industrial History of the United\r\n     States_ (1913); and C. D. Wright, _Industrial Evolution of the\r\n     United States_ (1907), are manuals containing much valuable\r\n     matter. The brief introductions to the chapters in G. S.\r\n     Callender, _Selections from the Economic History of the United\r\n     Slates_ (1909), are always illuminating. The foreign policy of\r\n     Jefferson and Madison is extensively reviewed in A. T. Mahan, _Sea\r\n     Power in its Relations to the War of 1812_ (2 vols., 1905).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE APPROACH OF WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Administration of James Madison began with what seemed like a\r\ndiplomatic triumph. Negotiations with the new British minister, Erskine,\r\nled to a complete agreement on all the points in dispute. Full\r\nreparation was to be made for the Chesapeake affair. The offensive\r\norders in council of 1807 were to be withdrawn on a fixed date.\r\nThereupon, with undisguised satisfaction, the President issued a\r\nproclamation, April 21, 1809, renewing commercial intercourse with Great\r\nBritain. General rejoicing followed. Ships which had been tied up to\r\nwharves for eighteen months put to sea with crowded holds. Those\r\nRepublicans who had stanchly upheld the Jeffersonian policy of peaceable\r\ncoercion boldly claimed for the embargo the credit of having brought\r\nabout this happy consummation. Some misgivings were excited, to be sure,\r\nby the report of a new order in council which substituted a blockade of\r\nHolland, France, and Italy for the order of November, 1807; yet weeks of\r\nsmug satisfaction were enjoyed by the Administration before it was\r\nbewildered by the tidings that Canning had recalled Erskine and\r\nrepudiated all his acts. Madison had to submit to \"the mortifying\r\nnecessity\" of issuing another proclamation reviving the Non-Intercourse\r\nAct against Great Britain.\r\n\r\nErskine was replaced by Francis James Jackson, a typical representative\r\nof the governing class,--intolerant, overbearing, and contemptuous. He\r\nhad been chosen in 1807 for the brutal destruction of the Danish fleet\r\nat Copenhagen. Pinkney described him as \"completely attached to all\r\nthose British principles and doctrines which sometimes give us trouble.\"\r\nMadison was speedily convinced that conciliation was not the keynote of\r\nthis man's mission. After the first exchange of notes, he took the pen\r\nout of the hand of Robert Smith, his incompetent Secretary of State, in\r\norder to deal more effectually with the adversary. When Jackson\r\nintimated that Erskine had been disavowed for disobedience to\r\ninstructions and that the Administration was somehow responsible for\r\nthis misconduct, Madison warned him sharply that \"such insinuations are\r\ninadmissible in the intercourse of a foreign minister with a government\r\nthat understands what it owes itself\"; and a few days later, after an\r\nexhibition of domineering temper on the part of Jackson, Madison\r\ninformed him that no further communications would be received. Months\r\npassed, however, before Jackson was recalled; and in the mean time he\r\nmade a tour through the Eastern States where he was warmly welcomed by\r\nthe Federalists. No better evidence was needed to convince the\r\nAdministration of the unpatriotic and pro-British attitude of Federalist\r\nNew England.\r\n\r\nThe Non-Intercourse Act had brought some measure of relief to New\r\nEngland shipping. Trade with parts of the European continent could now\r\nbe carried on by those who wished to incur the hazard. A greater volume\r\nof trade was probably carried on illicitly with England. Amelia Island,\r\njust across the Florida line, and Halifax, in Nova Scotia, became\r\nintermediate ports to which American goods went for reshipment to Europe\r\nand to which British merchandise was shipped for distribution in the\r\nUnited States. Notwithstanding these well-known evasions of the law,\r\nCongress would probably have been content to leave well enough alone but\r\nfor the fact that the Non-Intercourse Act would expire by limitation in\r\nthe spring of 1810. Some action was imperative. A bill was drawn by the\r\nAdministration to meet the situation and introduced in the House by\r\nMacon; but it failed to command the support of the party and was dropped\r\nin favor of a second bill, commonly known as Macon's Bill No. 2, though\r\nhe was not the author of it. This measure eventually became law, May 1,\r\n1810. \"It marked the last stage toward the admitted failure of\r\ncommercial restrictions as a substitute for war,\" writes Mr. Adams. By\r\nrepealing the Non-Intercourse Act it left commerce free once more to\r\nseek the markets of the world. In case either Great Britain or France\r\nshould revoke or modify its hostile policy, the President was authorized\r\nto revive the Non-Intercourse Act against the delinquent nation.\r\n\r\nAfter the Non-Intercourse Act of 1809, Napoleon had begun the\r\n\"sequestration\" of American vessels in European ports. Sequestration\r\nproved to be only a euphemistic expression for confiscation. On May 14,\r\nhe issued from Rambouillet a decree which authorized the seizure and\r\ncondemnation of all American ships in French ports. With an eye to the\r\nneeds of his war chest, the Emperor calculated that by drawing in this\r\nnet he would make a catch amounting to about six million dollars. As a\r\nmatter of fact, this was a conservative estimate. The American consul at\r\nParis reported the seizure of one hundred and thirty-four vessels\r\nbetween April, 1809, and April, 1810. The actual loss to American\r\nshipowners could not have been less than ten millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nThe news of the passage of Macon's bill suggested another stroke to the\r\nwily conqueror of Europe. On August 5, he announced to the American\r\nMinister that the decrees of Berlin and Milan were revoked and would be\r\ninoperative after November 1, \"it being understood that in consequence\r\nof this declaration the English are to revoke their orders in council\r\nand renounce the new principles of blockade,\" and that the United\r\nStates, conforming to its act of May 1, 1810, would \"cause their rights\r\nto be respected by the English.\"\r\n\r\nAccepting this letter at its face value, with a credulity which now\r\nseems incredible, President Madison proclaimed on November 2 that France\r\nhad withdrawn its decrees, and that in consequence commercial\r\nintercourse with Great Britain would be suspended on and after February\r\n2, 1811. Madison's haste was due to a very natural desire to coerce\r\nGreat Britain into a similar renunciation, but to his chagrin, the\r\nBritish Ministry refused to accept the mere notification of Napoleon as\r\nevidence of the repeal of the various decrees. Even the supporters of\r\nthe Administration became uneasy as months passed without any formal\r\nedict of revocation. Might not the courts adjudge that the decrees had\r\nnot been repealed _pro forma_? The Administration was greatly perturbed\r\nin December, too, by the news that two American vessels had been\r\nsequestered at Bordeaux. After much hesitation, Congress came to the\r\nsupport of the President and revived the Non-Intercourse Act against\r\nGreat Britain, at the same time admitting the weakness of its position\r\nby the additional provision that the courts should not entertain the\r\nquestion whether the French decrees were or were not revoked. On the\r\nsame day, February 28, 1811, Pinkney took formal leave of the Prince\r\nRegent under circumstances which presaged, if they did not imply, a\r\nrupture of diplomatic relations. Yet the British Ministry had so little\r\ncomprehension of the temper of the American people that at this very\r\nmoment Wellesley was drafting instructions for the new Minister, Mr.\r\nAugustus John Foster, which bade him yield not a jot or a tittle to the\r\nalleged rights of neutrals. He was, however, to make proper reparation\r\nfor the Chesapeake affair.\r\n\r\nIn these months of struggle for the rights of neutral commerce, the\r\nquestion of impressments had been relegated to second place in the minds\r\nof Americans. The blockade of New York by British frigates in the spring\r\nof 1811 suddenly revived the old controversy. For a year past an\r\nAmerican squadron under the command of Commodore John Rodgers had\r\npatrolled the coast, under instructions to protect all merchantmen from\r\nmolestation by armed foreign cruisers within the three-mile limit.\r\n\r\nThe British frigate Guerriere had made itself particularly offensive by\r\nits search crews and arbitrary seizures of alleged deserters. On May 16,\r\n1811, Commodore Rodgers's flagship, the frigate President carrying\r\nforty-four guns, sighted a British sloop-of-war some fifty miles east of\r\nCape Henry, which he believed to be the Guerriere, and wishing to make\r\ninquiries about a certain seaman who was reported to have been\r\nimpressed, Rodgers sailed toward the stranger. The vessel acted in a\r\nmanner which was thought suspicious, so the President gave chase. On\r\ncoming within range about dusk, the American frigate was fired upon, so\r\nit was alleged in a subsequent court of inquiry. The President then\r\nopened its batteries and in less than fifteen minutes had overpowered\r\nthe British corvette. To his surprise and disappointment, Rodgers then\r\nlearned that his antagonist was not the Guerriere, but the Little Belt,\r\na vessel far inferior to his own and carrying only twenty guns. When the\r\nnew British Minister arrived in Washington, he found the Administration\r\nsingularly indifferent to the historic Chesapeake affair. In the opinion\r\nof the American public, the President had avenged the Chesapeake.\r\n\r\nWhile Congress was vacillating between non-intercourse and partial\r\nnon-intercourse, in the early months of 1810, with a strong inclination\r\ntoward the path of least resistance, one voice was raised for war. Henry\r\nClay was then filling out an unexpired term in the Senate upon\r\nappointment by the Governor of Kentucky. Born in Virginia, thirty-three\r\nyears before, he had sought his fortune as a young lawyer in the new\r\ncommunities beyond the Alleghanies. Closely identified with the\r\naggressive spirit of his section, he voiced a growing sense of\r\nhumiliation that his country should be buffeted by every British\r\nministry. The people of Kentucky and Tennessee had little patience with\r\nhalf measures in defense of national rights. The petty diplomacy of\r\ncloset statesmen did not appeal to the soul of the frontiersman who was\r\naccustomed to hew his way to his goal. The people of this section,\r\nimperial in its dimensions, were prepared for large tasks done in a bold\r\nway. Their ideas of the Union transcended the policies of Eastern\r\nstatesmen, whose eyes saw no farther than the tops of the Alleghanies\r\nand whose ears listened all too readily to the admonitions of European\r\nchancellors. Clay spoke heatedly of the \"ignominious surrender of our\r\nrights\"--heritage of the heroes of the Revolution. He would have\r\nCongress exhibit the vigor of their forbears. \"The conquest of Canada is\r\nin your power,\" he cried. \"I trust I shall not be deemed presumptuous\r\nwhen I state that I verily believe that the militia of Kentucky alone\r\nare competent to place Montreal and Upper Canada at your feet.\" This was\r\na new and unfamiliar style of oratory in the Senate of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, however, the United States seemed far more likely to\r\nacquire the Floridas than Canada. In the summer of 1810, Americans who\r\nhad crossed the border and settled in and around the district of West\r\nFeliciana rose in revolt against the Spanish governor at Baton Rouge,\r\nand declared West Florida a free and independent state, appealing to the\r\nSupreme Ruler of the world for the rectitude of their intentions. What\r\ntheir intentions were appeared in a petition to the President for\r\nannexation to the United States. This was an opportune moment for the\r\nrealization of the hopes which Madison had cherished ever since the\r\nacquisition of Louisiana. On October 27, 1810, he issued a proclamation,\r\nannouncing that Governor Claiborne would take possession of West Florida\r\nto the river Perdido, in the name of the United States.\r\n\r\nNot satisfied with this achievement, President Madison called attention\r\nin a secret message to the condition of East Florida and asked Congress\r\nfor authority to take temporary possession of any part or parts of the\r\nterritory. With equal secrecy Congress gave the desired authorization,\r\nand the President immediately sent two commissioners with large\r\ndiscretionary powers to the St. Mary's River. In March, 1812, another\r\n\"revolution\" took place. The Spanish governor of East Florida was forced\r\nto surrender and to permit the occupation of Amelia Island in the name\r\nof the United States. The farce was too broad, however, even for the\r\neager Administration. The President was obliged to disavow the acts of\r\nhis agents. But Amelia Island was not evacuated until May, 1813, and\r\nWest Florida was never released. After much deliberation Congress\r\nannexed part of the region to the new State of Louisiana and joined the\r\nrest to the Territory of Mississippi.\r\n\r\nIn the Northwest also American pioneers were overrunning the bounds, not\r\nthose fixed by international agreement, to be sure, but those marked by\r\nIndian treaties, which commanded even less respect. A society which\r\nbelieved that the only good Indian was a dead Indian was not likely to\r\nbe over-nice in its appraisal of his property rights. The line of\r\nintercourse marked by the Treaty of Greenville in 1795 had receded\r\nsomewhat as home-seekers had pushed their way up the rivers from the\r\nOhio into the Indiana Territory; but the vast interior around the upper\r\nwaters of the Wabash River was still closed to white men. Governor\r\nWilliam Henry Harrison fully shared the irritation of the settlers that\r\nIndians should monopolize the best lands. He was therefore a willing\r\nagent of the President when in 1804 and 1805 he took advantage of the\r\nnecessities of certain chieftains, whom he called \"the most depraved\r\nwretches on earth,\" to despoil whole tribes of their lands, under the\r\nguise of treaties.\r\n\r\nAmong the better class of Indians this policy aroused the bitterest\r\nresentment. The rise of Tecumseh, son of a Shawnee warrior, and of his\r\nbrother the Prophet, dates from this time. It was the aim of these\r\nremarkable individuals to prevent the further alienation of Indian lands\r\nby limiting the authority of irresponsible local chiefs and conferring\r\nit upon a congress of warriors from all allied tribes. During the year\r\n1808, Tecumseh and the Prophet laid the foundation of a confederacy by\r\nestablishing an Indian village on Tippecanoe Creek, one hundred and\r\nfifty miles above Vincennes.\r\n\r\nIn the following year (1809), Governor Harrison anticipated the\r\nformation of this Indian confederation by beginning negotiations with\r\nthe same irresponsible sachems for the cession of more lands. The\r\ntreaty, which was readily concluded, carried despair to the heart of\r\nevery follower of Tecumseh, for it conveyed to the National Government\r\nthree millions of acres of the best lands in the Indian country,\r\nextending along both banks of the Wabash for a hundred miles. An\r\nalliance with the British seemed to be the only recourse of the Indians.\r\nOnly a spark was needed to start a conflagration along the whole\r\nfrontier.\r\n\r\nAlthough war was believed to be imminent by the people of Indiana, the\r\nwinter and summer of 1811 passed without untoward events. Toward the end\r\nof October, Harrison began a forward movement into the Indian country.\r\nOn the morning of November 7, his camp on the banks of the Tippecanoe\r\nwas attacked. A sharp engagement followed, in which the army narrowly\r\nescaped disaster; but the troops rallied and finally succeeded in\r\nrouting the Indians. In the abandoned village of the Prophet were found\r\nEnglish arms--confirmatory evidence, it was said, of the part which the\r\nBritish in Canada had taken in the projects of Tecumseh and the Prophet.\r\nOccurring at a moment of tension between the United States and Great\r\nBritain, the battle of Tippecanoe may be regarded properly as \"a\r\npremature outbreak of the great wars of 1812.\" An unforeseen consequence\r\nof this skirmish on the frontier was the rise of a new popular hero in\r\nthe West.\r\n\r\nNationally minded men indulged high hopes of the new Congress which\r\nconvened at the capital in November, 1811. The presence of some seventy\r\nnew members, many of whom belonged to a younger generation, warranted\r\nthe expectation that the Twelfth Congress would exhibit greater vigor\r\nthan its predecessor. In organizing, the House passed over Macon, who\r\nbelonged to the old school of statesmen, and chose as Speaker Henry\r\nClay, who had exchanged his seat in the Senate for this more stirring\r\narena. Clay's conception of the Speakership was novel. He was determined\r\nto be something more than a mere presiding officer. As a leader of his\r\nparty he proposed to use his powers of office to shape legislation. His\r\nheart was set upon an aggressive policy. War had no terrors for him. He\r\ntherefore named his committees with the possibility of war in mind.\r\n\r\nThere were many young men who shared Clay's impatience with the policy\r\nof peaceable coercion and its humiliating sequel. Grundy, of Tennessee,\r\nhad been elected because he openly favored war. He admitted that he was\r\n\"anxious not only to add the Floridas to the south, but the Canadas to\r\nthe north of this Empire.\" John C. Calhoun, a new member from South\r\nCarolina, openly repudiated the restrictive system of the President as a\r\nmode of resistance suited neither to the genius of the people nor to the\r\ngeographical character of the country. \"We have had a peace like a war,\"\r\nhe cried; \"in the name of Heaven let us not have the only thing that is\r\nworse--a war like a peace!\" Clay left the chair frequently to stir the\r\nHouse by his glowing eloquence. Whatever else might be said about these\r\nyoung stalwarts, no one could doubt their ardent nationalism and\r\ndevotion to the Union. Even the President was moved to allude gently in\r\nhis annual message to the duty of assuming \"an attitude demanded by the\r\ncrisis and corresponding with the national spirit and expectations.\"\r\n\r\nThe response of Congress was exasperatingly slow. It was January before\r\na bill to increase the standing army by twenty-five thousand men became\r\nlaw. Another month passed before Congress would agree to a bill\r\nauthorizing the President to raise a volunteer force of fifty thousand\r\nmen. No arguments would move the House to vote an appropriation of seven\r\nand a half million dollars for a navy of twenty frigates and twelve\r\nships-of-the-line. Even more discouraging was the reluctance of Congress\r\nto anticipate the financial drain of war by levying the internal revenue\r\ntaxes which Gallatin strongly recommended, now that Congress had\r\nsuffered the charter of the National Bank to expire. Without that\r\nimportant instrument of credit, he saw no alternative but to revive the\r\nexcise which was so hateful to Republicans. In the end Congress\r\nauthorized a loan of eleven million dollars, but no additional taxes.\r\n\r\n[Map: Vote of House on the Declaration of War June 4, 1812]\r\n\r\nFrom the first the war party had fixed upon Great Britain as the object\r\nof attack. In the sober light of history, France appears to be quite as\r\nmuch an enemy to American commerce. But so long as the Administration\r\nmaintained that Napoleon had withdrawn his decrees, and that England had\r\nnot, consistency required that Great Britain should be regarded as the\r\ngreater offender. Reparation had been made for the Chesapeake affair, to\r\nbe sure, but no guaranties had been given that the rights of\r\nneutral vessels would be respected on the high seas. Besides, the group\r\nof young Republicans led by Clay and Grundy had looked forward to the\r\nconquest of Canada on the north and of Florida on the south as the\r\nresult of war. Madison was too keen a politician not to know that he\r\ncould not afford to alienate this group if he wished a second term in\r\noffice. On April 1, he recommended an embargo for sixty days, and two\r\nmonths later, on June 1, he sent his famous war message to Congress.\r\n\r\nIn reciting the grievances of the United States, the President thrust\r\ninto the foreground \"the continued practice of violating the American\r\nflag on the great highway of nations, and of seizing and carrying off\r\npersons sailing under it.\" No one could deny that these were real\r\ngrievances, but they had not been pressed in recent negotiations as a\r\npossible cause of war. A second grievance was the blockade of American\r\nports by British cruisers. \"They hover over and harass our entering and\r\ndeparting commerce,\" said the President. \"To the most insulting\r\npretentions they have added the most lawless proceedings in our very\r\nharbors; and have wantonly spilt American blood within the sanctuary of\r\nour territorial jurisdiction.\" This grievance was also real, but not of\r\nrecent date. When the President alluded to \"pretended blockades\" under\r\nwhich \"our commerce has been plundered in every sea,\" he touched upon\r\noutrages which were still fresh in the minds of all. \"Not content with\r\nthese occasional expedients for laying waste our neutral trade,\"\r\ncontinued the message, \"the Cabinet of Great Britain resorted, at\r\nlength, to the sweeping system of blockades, under the name of Orders in\r\nCouncil.\" Finally, the President did not refrain from the plain\r\nintimation that the Indian hostilities on the frontier were due to the\r\ninfluence of British traders and British garrisons.\r\n\r\nThree days later the House of Representatives passed a bill declaring\r\nwar by a vote of 79 to 49. The opposition came largely from the\r\nNortheast. The representatives from Connecticut and Rhode Island were to\r\na man against war, and they were supported by Federalists from\r\nMassachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, and Delaware. In the\r\nSenate the vote stood 19 for war and 13 against it. \"Except\r\nPennsylvania, the entire representation of no Northern State declared\r\nitself for the war; except Kentucky, every State south of the Potomac\r\nand Ohio voted for the declaration.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Congress was debating the alternatives of peace or war, the\r\nBritish Government took a step which under modern conditions would have\r\naverted hostilities. Taking advantage of a decree of Napoleon dating\r\nfrom 1810, which declared his edicts revoked so far as American vessels\r\nwere concerned, the Ministry announced on June 23 that the British\r\norders would be withdrawn. But just five days earlier, President Madison\r\nhad proclaimed a state of war between the United States and Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\n\r\n     BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\r\n\r\n     A brief account of the events which formed the prelude to the War\r\n     of 1812 may be found in K. C. Babcock, _The Rise of American\r\n     Nationality_ (in _The American Nation_, vol. 13, 1906). The\r\n     diplomatic and military antecedents of the war are set forth at\r\n     greater length in A. T. Mahan, _Sea Power in its Relation to the\r\n     War of 1812_ (2 vols., 1905). Biographies contribute much that is\r\n     of interest. Carl Schurz, _Henry Clay_ (2 vols., 1887), is one of\r\n     the best. J. T. Morse, _John Quincy Adams_ (1882), and Edmund\r\n     Quincy, _Life of Josiah Quincy of Massachusetts_ (1867), also\r\n     contain interesting information. M. P. Follett, _The Speaker of\r\n     the House of Representatives_ (1896); Edward Stanwood, _History of\r\n     the Presidency_ (1898); and M. L. Hinsdale, _History of the\r\n     President's Cabinet_ (1911), touch upon important aspects of\r\n     politics. The volume entitled _Memoirs and Letters of Dolly\r\n     Madison_ (1886) gives many charming glimpses of social life at the\r\n     capital. The discomforts and hazards of travel in the West are\r\n     described with great vivacity by Margaret Van Horn, _A Journey to\r\n     Ohio in 1810_ (1912).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE WAR OF 1812\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen hostilities began in North America, the war establishment of the\r\nUnited States stood officially at 36,700 men. Actually the army\r\nconsisted of ten regiments with ranks half filled, scattered in\r\ngarrisons from Mackinac to Lake Champlain,--a force of less than 10,000\r\nmen, of whom 4000 were raw recruits. The staff was made up of old and\r\nincompetent officers; and from a military point of view the new\r\nappointments left much to be desired. The navy which was to contest the\r\nsupremacy of the seas with the victor at Trafalgar consisted of twelve\r\nsea-going vessels and some two hundred gunboats, which were useless\r\nexcept for coast defense. There was bitter truth in the manifesto issued\r\nby the Federalist members of Congress when it said: \"Our enemy is the\r\ngreatest maritime power that has ever been on earth, and to her we offer\r\nthe most tempting prizes. Our merchantmen are on every sea. Our rich\r\ncities lie along the Atlantic seaboard close to the water's edge. And to\r\ndefend these from the cruisers of Great Britain we are to have an army\r\nof raw recruits yet to be raised and a navy of gunboats now stranded on\r\nthe beaches and frigates that have long been rotting in the slime of the\r\nPotomac.\"\r\n\r\nThe worst aspect of the war was its sectional character. New England was\r\nin opposition. From the outset the activity of the National\r\nAdministration was weakened by the indubitable fact that the United\r\nStates, as the Federalists were never tired of repeating, began the war\r\n\"as a divided people.\" When General Dearborn made requisition upon the\r\ngovernors of Massachusetts and Connecticut for militia to defend the\r\ncoast, Governor Strong ignored the summons. Pressed for a reply, he\r\nfinally stated to the Secretary of War that the judges of the Supreme\r\nCourt of Massachusetts had advised him that the commanders-in-chief of\r\nthe militia in the several States, rather than the President, had the\r\nright to determine whether any of the exigencies contemplated by the\r\nConstitution existed so as to require them to place the militia in the\r\nservice of the United States. The judges also advised the governor that\r\nthe militia, when in the service of the United States, could not\r\nlawfully be commanded by any federal officers below the President, but\r\nonly by state officers. The general assembly of Connecticut sustained\r\nGovernor Griswold in a similar attitude toward the federal authorities,\r\nholding that the war was an offensive war to which the provisions of the\r\nConstitution respecting the militia did not apply.\r\n\r\nFrom the first the war-hawks had cried, \"On to Canada,\" for their hope\r\nof conquest was undisguised. \"Agrarian cupidity,\" declared Randolph,\r\n\"not maritime right, urges the war. Ever since the report of the\r\nCommittee on Foreign Relations came into the House, we have heard but\r\none word,--like the whippoorwill, but one eternal monotonous\r\ntone,--Canada, Canada, Canada!\" Military considerations, however,\r\nprobably determined the campaign of 1812,--so far, indeed, as any\r\nwell-considered plans were worked out. A general advance was to be made\r\nalong the route by Lake Champlain to Montreal. Three expeditions were\r\nalso to be sent against Sackett's Harbor, Niagara, and Malden. All were\r\nstrategic points on the Lakes; but Malden was particularly important as\r\nthe center of British influence among the Indians of the Northwest.\r\n\r\nThe expedition against Malden, which was entrusted to General William\r\nHull, not only failed to accomplish its purpose, but terminated in the\r\nmost humiliating reverse of the war. For reasons that have never been\r\nadequately explained, Hull laid siege to Malden instead of attacking it\r\nat once with his superior force; and when British reenforcements\r\nappeared, he not only abandoned the siege, but on August 15, surrendered\r\nFort Detroit without firing a shot. The army, the fort, and the\r\nundisputed control of the Michigan country passed into the hands of the\r\nBritish. On the same day occurred the surrender of Fort Dearborn and the\r\nmassacre of its garrison by the Indians.\r\n\r\nThe other military operations on the northern frontier were scarcely\r\nless inglorious. The failure of the attack upon Queenston, October 13,\r\nwas due largely to the incompetence of the commanding general. Nowhere\r\ndid the American troops pierce the Niagara or Lake Champlain frontier.\r\nThe Duke of Wellington was well within the truth when he declared the\r\nAmerican campaign of 1812 \"beneath criticism.\"\r\n\r\nThe smart of these humiliating failures was only relieved by the series\r\nof stirring naval victories which began with the duel between the\r\nConstitution and the Guerriere. The frigates met on August 19, some\r\nthree hundred miles off Cape Race. \"In less than thirty minutes from the\r\ntime we got alongside of the enemy,\" reported Captain Hull of the\r\nConstitution, \"she was left without a spar standing, and the hull cut to\r\npieces in such a manner as to make it difficult to keep her above\r\nwater.\" The effect of this victory was electric. When the Constitution\r\nreached Boston Harbor, even Federalists broke into exultation. The cry\r\nin every New England home was, \"Thank God for Hull's victory!\" Nothing\r\ncould have been better timed and more dramatic. The papers which\r\nannounced the humiliating surrender of General Hull contained the news\r\nof his nephew's victory.\r\n\r\nIf the victory of the Constitution was won on unequal terms,--the\r\nGuerriere was undoubtedly inferior,--the British Admiralty could not\r\nexcuse a second naval defeat on this score. On October 17, the American\r\nsloop-of-war Wasp encountered the brig Frolic convoying merchantmen six\r\nhundred miles east of Norfolk. There was little to choose between the\r\nvessels either in size or equipment, yet the marksmanship of the\r\nAmerican gunners was so far superior that in forty-three minutes the\r\ncrew of the Wasp had boarded the Frolic. Not even the subsequent capture\r\nof both vessels by a British ship-of-the-line could dim the glory of\r\nthis victory. A week later the frigate United States under Captain\r\nDecatur captured the Macedonia and brought her into New London--\"the\r\nonly British frigate ever brought as a prize into an American port.\" In\r\nDecember the Constitution, now commanded by Captain Bainbridge, added to\r\nher laurels by overpowering the powerful frigate Java.\r\n\r\nThe effect of these disasters upon the British public was out of all\r\nproportion to the actual value of the vessels lost. Canning afterward\r\ndeclared that the loss of the Guerriere and the Macedonia produced a\r\nsensation scarcely to be equaled by the most violent convulsion of\r\nnature. \"The sacred spell of the invincibility of the British navy was\r\nbroken by those unfortunate captures.\"\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the war occurred a presidential election. Madison had\r\nbeen the unanimous choice of the congressional caucus held in May; but\r\nonly eighty-three out of one hundred and thirty-three Republicans had\r\nattended, and the discontent of New York Republicans was well known. The\r\nnomination of De Witt Clinton by the New York legislative caucus opened\r\nwide the breach in the party. In September a convention of Federalists\r\nrepeated the error of 1804 and indorsed Clinton's nomination, naming as\r\nhis partner Jared Ingersoll, of Pennsylvania. Elbridge Gerry, of\r\nMassachusetts, was finally nominated for Vice-President by the\r\nRepublicans. The alternatives presented to the people seemed to be\r\nMadison and continued war ineffectively conducted, or Clinton and still\r\nmore humiliating peace. New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and all the New\r\nEngland States but Vermont, preferred Clinton. The South and West\r\nsupported Madison; but without the vote of Pennsylvania Madison would\r\nhave been defeated.\r\n\r\nTo retrieve Hull's disaster, General William Henry Harrison, the hero of\r\nTippecanoe, was placed in command of the Western army in the fall of\r\n1812; but a succession of mishaps overtook his expedition into the\r\nNorthwest. He not only failed to reach Detroit, but lost most of his\r\navailable troops by disease, desertion, and the onset of British\r\ndetachments from Fort Malden.\r\n\r\nIt was now clear that the control of the Lakes was indispensable for a\r\nsuccessful invasion of Canada. At the close of the year 1812, there was\r\nnot a war-vessel flying the American flag on Lake Erie. To create a\r\nfleet was the task set for Oliver Hazard Perry, a young naval officer,\r\nwho was sent from Newport to Presqu' Isle. Of the needful supplies only\r\ntimber was abundant; the rest had to be brought overland from\r\nPhiladelphia by way of Pittsburg. Surmounting all obstacles,\r\nnevertheless, the energetic Perry finally got together a flotilla of\r\nvessels which was quite equal to the British squadron. The two fleets\r\nmet in battle off Sandusky on September 10, 1813. The American boat\r\nLawrence, Perry's flagship, was obliged to strike her colors, but Perry\r\nboarded another vessel of his fleet and succeeded in turning defeat into\r\na brilliant victory. \"We have met the enemy and they are ours,\" was his\r\ntriumphant dispatch to General Harrison.\r\n\r\nThe way was now open to the invasion of Canada. Under the protection of\r\nPerry's fleet, Harrison was able to transport his army to the Canadian\r\nshore below Fort Malden. The British troops were already in full\r\nretreat. On October 5, 1813, the American army overtook them and in a\r\nshort but decisive battle on the river Thames revenged the loss of\r\nDetroit. Among the dead on the British side was found the body of\r\nTecumseh. In point of numbers, the battle of the Thames is\r\ninsignificant; but it has an important place in the annals of the war\r\nbecause it destroyed the British military power in the Northwest and\r\nrecovered control of the Michigan Territory.\r\n\r\nNo such success attended the movement of American troops on the Niagara\r\nand St. Lawrence frontier. The control of Lake Ontario was in doubt\r\nthroughout the year 1813. The military operations, first under Dearborn,\r\nand then under Wilkinson and Hampton, were indecisive. Indeed, the\r\nevents of the year served only one good purpose: they revealed the\r\nincompetence of the older generals and the ability of the younger\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nThe loss of the Chesapeake in a duel with the Shannon, on June 1, 1813,\r\noutside of Boston Harbor, left the United States with an available\r\nsea-going navy of just two frigates and a few small sloops. All the\r\nother frigates were shut up in various ports by the British blockade,\r\nwhich extended from Cape Cod to Florida. The burden of offense during\r\nthe rest of the war fell upon privateers. During the war more than five\r\nhundred fitted out in American ports. In the year 1813 they took over\r\nthree hundred prizes, while the frigates took but seventy-nine. While\r\nBritish cruisers were blockading the coast of the United States, these\r\ncraft, with their beautiful lines and wonderful spread of canvas,\r\ncarried consternation to all British shippers in the English Channel and\r\nin the Irish Sea. They \"seize prizes in sight of those that should\r\nafford protection,\" complained the London _Times_, \"and if pursued put\r\non their sea-wings and laugh at the clumsy English pursuers.\" No\r\nexploits of the regular navy contributed so much to dispose the British\r\ngoverning class to peace as the depredations of these privateers.\r\n\r\nIn the remote Southwest, the war assumed a different character. There\r\nthe enemy on the border was not Great Britain but Spain. The people of\r\nthe Carolinas and Georgia fully expected to acquire the Floridas while\r\nthe North was wresting Canada from British control. Had President\r\nMadison been given his way, this wish would have been gratified; but\r\nCongress refused to countenance the seizure of East Florida, and in May,\r\n1813, Madison very reluctantly ordered the troops to evacuate Amelia\r\nIsland. No scruples deterred Congress from authorizing the occupation of\r\nWest Florida. In the spring of 1813, General Wilkinson forced the\r\nsurrender of the only Spanish fort on Mobile Bay and took possession of\r\nthe country as far as the Perdido--\"the only permanent gain of territory\r\nmade during the war.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the first year of the war the younger warriors of the Western\r\nCreeks, in what is now Alabama, had been incited to hostilities by\r\nTecumseh, and in the following spring began depredations which\r\nculminated in the capture of Fort Mims and the massacre of its\r\ninhabitants on August 30, 1813. The horrors of an Indian war brought\r\nevery able-bodied settler in the adjoining States to arms. Before the\r\nend of the year seven thousand whites had invaded the Indian territory\r\nand had killed about one fifth of the Creek warriors. The hero of the\r\nwar was General Andrew Jackson, who at the head of an army of Tennessee\r\nmilitiamen won a decisive battle at Horseshoe Bend on the Tallapoosa\r\nRiver. On August 9, 1814, he forced the chieftains who had not fled\r\nacross the Florida border to sign a treaty of capitulation at Fort\r\nJackson and to cede nearly two thirds of their lands in southern Georgia\r\nand in what afterward became central Alabama. This phase of the war\r\nopened up a vast territory to settlement and made the military\r\nreputation of Andrew Jackson.\r\n\r\nOperations on the Niagara frontier were resumed by the American troops\r\nin 1814; but they were now directed by one of the new major-generals,\r\nJacob Brown, who infused a new spirit into his soldiers. On July 5,\r\nGeneral Winfield Scott's brigade won a signal victory at Chippewa. Three\r\nweeks later, on July 25, the entire army fought a desperate battle at\r\nLundy's Lane, which lasted from sunset to midnight. The Americans\r\nclaimed a victory, but the losses were about even and the British\r\nremained in possession of the field. At the close of the year, despite\r\nthe valiant fighting of Brown's army, the situation on the Niagara had\r\nnot changed materially. The invasion of Canada and a peace dictated from\r\nQuebec seemed as remote as ever.\r\n\r\nThe British plans for the campaign of 1814 called for \"a diversion on\r\nthe coasts of the United States, in favor of the army employed in the\r\ndefense of Upper and Lower Canada.\" For the first time since the\r\nopening of hostilities, British military authorities could concentrate\r\ntheir attention on the war in North America. The defeat of Napoleon on\r\nthe plains of Leipzig had thrown his shattered columns back upon France.\r\nThither the allied armies had followed him and forced his capitulation.\r\nWith the end of European wars in sight, Wellington could release his\r\nveteran troops for service in America. In early summer eleven thousand\r\nseasoned troops were sent to Canada. Four thousand more were dispatched\r\nunder Major-General Ross, of the Peninsular army, to cooperate with the\r\nnavy under Admiral Cochrane on the shores of Chesapeake Bay. Later in\r\nthe year Major-General Pakenham, also a veteran of the Peninsular\r\ncampaign, was sent with ten thousand troops to seize the mouth of the\r\nMississippi and to force the capitulation of the West by closing the\r\nports on the Gulf.\r\n\r\nThose whose memories went back thirty-seven years may well have recalled\r\nBurgoyne's expedition, for it was by the old Lake Champlain route that\r\nSir George Prevost began his invasion of New York in September, 1814.\r\nHis objective was Plattsburg, where an American army of not more than\r\ntwo thousand men was stationed. Accompanying his army, to insure its\r\nline of communication with Canada, was a fleet consisting of a frigate,\r\na brig, and a dozen smaller vessels. To this fleet, Captain Thomas\r\nMacdonough could oppose only a corvette and a dozen small craft. The\r\nfleets met in a battle for the control of the lake on September 11. The\r\nresourcefulness of the young American officer saved the day. By winding\r\nhis corvette, the Saratoga, about, so as to bring her unused guns to\r\nbear just when the fight seemed lost, he forced the formidable Confiance\r\nto strike her colors. The surrender of the smaller British boats\r\nfollowed. The battle of Plattsburg was decisive of the invasion. Fearing\r\ngreater disasters if he pressed on without the control of the waterway\r\nat his rear, Prevost at once ordered a retreat.\r\n\r\nThe expedition directed toward Chesapeake Bay was well under way before\r\nPrevost's ill-starred invasion began. On August 19, General Ross landed\r\nhis forces on the banks of Patuxent River, within striking distance of\r\nWashington. Marching leisurely across country toward the capital, the\r\nBritish finally met at Bladensburg a motley array of some seven thousand\r\nAmericans, hastily summoned from the countryside. What followed is not\r\neasily described. Some show of resistance was made by the marines from\r\nthe American gunboats in the Patuxent; but for the most part the\r\nAmericans were seized with a panic and fled in wild disorder. The\r\nPresident and his Cabinet took to the Virginia woods, leaving the enemy\r\nto wreak their vengeance on the government buildings. Having fired the\r\nCapitol, the White House, and other edifices, the British forces\r\nreturned to their fleet and reembarked. The historian can take no\r\npleasure in dwelling upon details which are discreditable to all\r\nconcerned; for if the British committed acts of vandalism, the Americans\r\nhad provoked retaliation when they burned the parliament houses at York\r\nin the campaign of 1813.\r\n\r\nAn attack upon Baltimore which might have resulted in further outrages\r\nwas frustrated by the measures of defense which the government of the\r\ncity had already wisely undertaken. After a skirmish in which General\r\nRoss was killed, and an ineffective bombardment of the harbor defenses,\r\nthe British withdrew.\r\n\r\nA visitor to the national capital after its capture described the\r\nPresident as \"miserably shattered and woe-begone,\" and heart-broken at\r\nthe defection of New England. To prosecute the war, money and men were\r\nneeded; but both were wanting. The Administration hoped, but hoped in\r\nvain, that the victories at Chippewa, Lundy's Lane, and Plattsburg would\r\nstimulate enlistments; but recruits were not likely to be lured by\r\npromises which every one knew the Government could not redeem. It became\r\nclearer every day that unless Congress was disposed to adopt Monroe's\r\nplan of conscription, the National Government would have to put its\r\ndependence upon state armies. In September, after Castine and the\r\neastern part of Maine to the Penobscot had been occupied by the British,\r\nGovernor Strong consented to call out the militia of Massachusetts, but\r\nhe was careful to place the troops under the command of state officers.\r\nAt the same time he made inquiry of the Secretary of War whether the\r\nexpenses of the militia would be assumed by the National Government.\r\nMonroe replied rather sharply that so long as Massachusetts refused to\r\nput her troops under the command of national officers, she need not\r\nexpect the United States to maintain them. The Governor of Connecticut\r\nhad already withdrawn the militia of that State from national service.\r\nAt the moment when Prevost was beginning his invasion, the Governor of\r\nVermont declined to call out the state militia because he doubted his\r\nauthority to order the militia out of the State. The Union seemed on the\r\npoint of disintegrating into its original elements.\r\n\r\nThe anxieties of the Administration were further increased by the action\r\nof the Massachusetts General Court, which called a convention of those\r\nStates \"the affinity of whose interests is closest,\" with the avowed\r\npurpose of devising some mode of common defense and of securing a\r\nconvention of delegates from all the States to revise the National\r\nConstitution. In spite of vigorous opposition, delegates were chosen, to\r\nmeet on December 15 with \"such as may be chosen by any or all of the\r\nother New England States.\" The legislatures of Connecticut and Rhode\r\nIsland responded promptly; but the legislature of Vermont unanimously\r\ndeclined the invitation, and New Hampshire failed to reply. The movement\r\nseemed all the more ominous after the fall elections, which resulted in\r\nthe choice of thirty-nine Federalist Congressmen from New England and of\r\nonly two Republicans. In the preceding Congress there had been thirty\r\nFederalists and eleven Republicans.\r\n\r\nThat members of the Essex Junto would gladly have seized this\r\nopportunity to remake the Federal Union by excluding the Western States\r\nappears clearly enough in the correspondence of men like Timothy\r\nPickering. A new Union of the \"good old thirteen States\" on terms set by\r\nNew England was believed to be well within the bounds of possibility.\r\nRadical newspapers referred with enthusiasm to the erection of a new\r\nfederal edifice. Little wonder that the harassed President was obsessed\r\nwith the idea that New England was on the verge of secession.\r\n\r\nFrom the first, however, this movement in New England was kept well in\r\nhand by men like Harrison Gray Otis, who always insisted that the object\r\nof a convention was to defend New England against the common enemy and\r\nto prevent radical action under the stress of popular excitement. If\r\nthis be true, it was unfortunate, to say the least, that these patriots\r\nchose just this moment, when the Federal Government was about to succumb\r\nto the common enemy, to propose alterations in the Constitution; and it\r\nwas equally unfortunate for the reputations of all concerned that they\r\nshould have held their deliberations in secret, giving an air of\r\nconspiracy to their proceedings. The official journal of the Convention\r\nat Hartford was not published until 1823. When the Convention adjourned\r\non January 5, 1815, all that the general public was permitted to know of\r\nits deliberations was contained in its famous report.\r\n\r\nThe Convention was at no little pains to reassure a waiting world that\r\nit did not contemplate or countenance secession. It was not yet ready to\r\nconcede that the defects in the Constitution were incurable nor that\r\nmultiplied abuses justified a severance of the Union, \"especially in a\r\ntime of war.\" \"If the Union be destined to dissolution, ... it should,\r\nif possible, be the work of peaceable times, and deliberate consent.\"\r\nBut these philosophical considerations did not deter the author of the\r\nreport from a vicious and partisan attack upon \"the multiplied abuses of\r\nbad administrations.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Madison must have read this document with mingled feelings,\r\nfor the Convention held, almost in the words of his Resolutions of 1798,\r\nthat the infractions of the Constitution were so \"deliberate, dangerous,\r\nand palpable\" as to put the liberties of the people in jeopardy and to\r\nmake it the duty of a State \"to interpose its authority for their\r\nprotection.\" The legislatures of the several States were recommended to\r\nadopt measures for protecting their citizens against all\r\nunconstitutional acts of Congress which should subject the militia or\r\nother citizens to forcible drafts, conscriptions, or impressments. They\r\nwere also urged to apply to the Federal Government for consent to some\r\narrangement whereby the States, separately or in concert, could\r\nundertake their own defense and retain a reasonable proportion of the\r\nnational taxes for the purpose. Finally, seven amendments to the\r\nConstitution were proposed, to prevent a recurrence of the grievances\r\nfrom which the New England States suffered. Four of these proposed\r\namendments put limitations upon Congress: a two-thirds vote of both\r\nhouses was to be required to admit a new State, to interdict commerce,\r\nto lay an embargo, and to declare war. In future, representation and\r\ndirect taxes were to be apportioned according to the respective numbers\r\nof free persons. Naturalized citizens were to be excluded from all\r\nfederal civil offices; and finally--a blow at the Virginia\r\ndynasty--\"the same person shall not be elected President of the United\r\nStates a second time; nor shall the President be elected from the same\r\nState two terms in succession.\"\r\n\r\nThe General Court of Massachusetts acted promptly. Three commissioners\r\nwere dispatched at once to Washington, to work out an amicable\r\narrangement for the defense of the State. On February 3, 1815, the\r\n\"three ambassadors,\" as they styled themselves, set out for the capital.\r\nTen days later, _en route_, they learned that General Andrew Jackson had\r\ndecisively repulsed an attack of the British upon New Orleans on January\r\n8. On reaching Washington the commissioners were met with the news that\r\na treaty of peace had been signed at Ghent. Their cause had met with the\r\nmost unlucky fate which can befall any cause in the United States: it\r\nhad become ridiculous. The tension of war-times relaxed in a roar of\r\nlaughter at their expense.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1813, Russia had endeavored to mediate between her\r\nally and the United States. President Madison had at once, and as it\r\nappeared somewhat precipitately, sent Albert Gallatin and James A.\r\nBayard as peace commissioners to St. Petersburg; but Great Britain\r\ndeclined the Czar's good offices. The American envoys, however, remained\r\nin Europe. When, then, in October, the British Ministry intimated that\r\nit was prepared to begin direct negotiations, President Madison created\r\na new commission by sending John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, and Jonathan\r\nRussell to join Gallatin and Bayard. In the last week in June, the\r\ncommissioners repaired to Ghent, which had been chosen as the place of\r\nmeeting. Thither the British negotiators followed them in leisurely\r\nfashion. The first joint conference was not held until August 8, 1814.\r\n\r\nThe task of the American commissioners was one of very great difficulty.\r\nConfronted by the unexpected demand that the revision of the Canadian\r\nboundary, the fisheries, and the establishment of an Indian state in the\r\nNorthwest should be included in the _pourparler_, they could only reply\r\nthat they had been instructed to discuss only matters of maritime\r\nlaw--impressments, blockades, and neutral rights. There seemed so little\r\nlikelihood of agreement that the American commissioners prepared to\r\nleave Ghent. But the British Ministry abated its extreme demands and\r\ncontinued the negotiations. At the same time new instructions from\r\nWashington advised the American representatives that they might drop the\r\nsubject of impressments if they found it an insuperable obstacle in the\r\nway of peace.\r\n\r\nThe insistence of the British agents upon the principle of _uti\r\npossidetis_--the state of possession at the close of the war--again\r\nthreatened to break off negotiations, for the Americans resolutely\r\ninsisted on the _status quo ante bellum_, a restoration of all places\r\ntaken during the war. It was at this juncture that tidings arrived of\r\nthe British repulse at Plattsburg. For a week the British Ministry\r\ndebated the feasibility of renewing the war; but the complications at\r\nthe Congress of Vienna, the \"prodigious expense\" of continued war, the\r\nchange in public opinion, and the emphatic conviction of Wellington that\r\nthe Ministry had \"no right from the state of the war to demand any\r\ncession of territory\"--these and many lesser considerations disposed the\r\nCabinet to ask the American envoys to prepare a draft of a treaty.\r\n\r\nStrong differences of opinion developed among the Americans when they\r\nset to work upon their preliminary draft. As the representative of\r\nWestern interests, Clay set himself obstinately against any further\r\nrecognition of the British right--secured by the treaty of 1783--of free\r\nnavigation of the Mississippi. Adams was equally determined not to\r\nsacrifice the correlative right to the Labrador and Newfoundland\r\nfisheries, which his father had secured in the Treaty of Paris.\r\nGallatin, the peacemaker, was in favor of offering to renew both\r\nprivileges; and he finally succeeded in winning Clay's reluctant assent\r\nto this plan. But when the British commissioners objected, both sides\r\nagreed to omit all reference to these vexing questions.\r\n\r\nThe treaty which was signed on December 24, 1814, is remarkable for its\r\nomissions. The reader will scan it in vain for any allusion to\r\nimpressments, blockades, and neutral rights. It is equally silent as to\r\nthe control of the Lakes, Indian territories, the fisheries, and the\r\nnavigation of the Mississippi. It was \"simply a cessation of\r\nhostilities, leaving every claim on either side open for future\r\nsettlement.\" Clay probably reflected the disappointment of Republicans\r\nwhen he pronounced it \"a damned bad treaty.\" Nevertheless, it brought\r\nwhat was most desired by the exhausted Administration--peace. Moreover,\r\nthe treaty must be viewed in the light of events in Europe. The\r\noverthrow of the Napoleonic Empire and the exile of Bonaparte gave\r\npromise of a return to normal conditions so far as maritime rights were\r\nconcerned. The victories of American seamen in the war were after all\r\nbetter guaranties of neutral rights than any declarations on parchment.\r\n\r\n\r\n     BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\r\n\r\n     Besides the larger histories, which contain abundant information\r\n     about the war, mention should be made of B. J. Lossing's\r\n     _Pictorial Field-Book of the War of 1812_ (1868), written by one\r\n     who visited most of the battlefields of the war. A well-balanced\r\n     account of the military operations is contained in K. C. Babcock's\r\n     _The Rise of American Nationality_ (in _The American Nation_, vol.\r\n     XIII, 1906). Theodore Roosevelt, _The Naval War of 1812_ (various\r\n     editions); E. S. Maclay, _History of the United States Navy from\r\n     1775 to 1901_ (3 vols., 1901-02), and _History of American\r\n     Privateers_ (1899); J. R. Spears, _History of Our Navy_ (4 vols.,\r\n     1897); and C. O. Paullin, _Commodore John Rodgers_ (1910), give\r\n     the history of the maritime war. The most comprehensive study of\r\n     the naval operations of the war is the work by Admiral Mahan\r\n     already cited. The part of Jackson in the war is set forth in many\r\n     biographies. The most picturesque is James Parton, _Life of Andrew\r\n     Jackson_ (3 vols., 1860); the most recent is J. S. Bassett, _Life\r\n     of Andrew Jackson_ (2 vols., 1911). S. E. Morison, _Life and\r\n     Letters of Harrison Gray Otis_ (2 vols., 1913), gives a fresh\r\n     account of the disaffection in New England and of the Hartford\r\n     Convention. The peace negotiations at Ghent are set forth\r\n     circumstantially by Henry Adams in his _History of the United\r\n     States_ (9 vols., 1889-91).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE RESULTS OF THE WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a message to Congress transmitting the treaty of peace, President\r\nMadison congratulated the country on the termination of a war \"waged\r\nwith a success which is the natural result of the wisdom of the\r\nlegislative councils, of the patriotism of the people, of the public\r\nspirit of the militia, and of the valor of the military and naval forces\r\nof the country.\" The verdict of history does not sustain this paean of\r\nvictory. \"The record, upon the whole,\" declares Admiral Mahan, \"is one\r\nof gloom, disaster, and governmental incompetence, resulting from lack\r\nof national preparation, due to the obstinate and blind prepossessions\r\nof the Government, and, in part, of the people.\" Public opinion indorsed\r\nthe President's estimate of the late struggle.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the people of the United States had seen little of\r\nthe disasters and ravages of war. All the important battles took place\r\non the borders. The great mass of the people were undisturbed in their\r\nvocations. There was hardly a day during the war when a farmer could not\r\ntill his acres in tranquillity. Not an important city save Washington\r\nwas taken during the war. Nor was the loss of life large in proportion\r\nto population. All told, the killed and wounded did not exceed five\r\nthousand men. Napoleon lost nearly two hundred thousand French soldiers\r\nin his disastrous Russian campaign.\r\n\r\nAmerican character appeared at its best and at its worst in these three\r\nyears of war. Even the British press could not gainsay the\r\nresourcefulness and intelligence of the American soldier and sailor,\r\nthough the phrase \"Yankee smartness\" conveyed also the unpleasant\r\nimputation of trickiness and moral laxity. Wherever conditions permitted\r\na fair test, the superiority of the American gunner was incontestable.\r\nThe greater losses of the British whenever the armies met on even terms\r\nproved the superior marksmanship of the American militiaman. The\r\nadaptation of the fast-sailing schooner to privateering was further\r\nevidence of an alert intellect which was quick to adapt means to ends.\r\nThis quality, to be sure, has been bred in every frontier folk by the\r\nvery necessities of existence, but it appeared in marked strength in the\r\nAmerican of this time. While the shipbuilders of New England were laying\r\nthe keels of these privateers, Robert Fulton was perfecting his\r\nsteamboat on the Delaware and Hudson rivers. In the year before the war,\r\nthe first steamboat appeared on the Ohio, and before the end of the war\r\nfourteen were plying on Western waters, and opening up a new era in the\r\nAmerican colonization of the continent.\r\n\r\nThis instinctive adaptation of means to ends was less successful in the\r\nrealm of American politics. No celerity could compensate for want of\r\nprevision on the part of the authorities at Washington. The lesson of\r\nthe war was not lost upon James Madison, at least. \"Experience has\r\ntaught us,\" said he in a message to Congress,--and the words amounted to\r\na confession of error,--\"that neither the pacific dispositions of the\r\nAmerican people nor the pacific character of their political\r\ninstitutions, can altogether exempt them from that strife which appears,\r\nbeyond the ordinary lot of nations, to be incident to the actual period\r\nof the world; and the same faithful monitor demonstrates that a certain\r\ndegree of preparation for war is not only indispensable to avert\r\ndisaster in the onset, but affords also the best security for the\r\ncontinuance of peace.\"\r\n\r\nThe indirect effects of war were more widely felt. The blockade affected\r\nadversely all the extractive industries upon which the vast majority of\r\nthe people in all the States depended. Only New England escaped\r\nunscathed--and the circumstance was not creditable to the section. In\r\nthe latter months of 1814 ruin stared the Southern planter in the face.\r\nThe lifting of the blockade wrought a transformation. Planters in the\r\nOld Dominion, who could find no market for their tobacco and wheat on\r\nFebruary 13, sold their produce on February 14 at prices which made them\r\nrich again. Flour which had found almost no purchasers at seven and a\r\nhalf dollars a barrel sold readily at ten. Imported commodities fell in\r\nprice correspondingly. Ships put to sea at once laden with the\r\naccumulated produce of two long years. The export trade, which had\r\nfallen to less than $7,000,000, leaped to $46,000,000 between March and\r\nOctober. Fully two thirds of this wealth accrued to the Southern\r\nplanters who raised the three great staples, tobacco, cotton, and rice.\r\nThe people of the Middle States shared only moderately in this\r\nprosperity. The value of the wheat and corn which the farmers of\r\nPennsylvania, New York, and New Jersey raised for export did not much\r\nexceed that of tobacco alone.\r\n\r\nThe return of peace brought relief also to the shipping industry of New\r\nEngland. Vessels which the embargo and the restrictive policy and the\r\nhazards of war had kept in port now put to sea again. But the European\r\nconditions which had created such immense profits for the Yankee skipper\r\nin 1805, 1806, and 1807 had passed away. Foreign ships now bid for the\r\ncarrying trade of the Atlantic, and their competition cut down freight\r\nrates to a point which caused melancholy forebodings in the homes of\r\nBoston and Salem shipowners.\r\n\r\nThe long period of commercial restriction followed by three years of war\r\ncaused a dislocation of industry in New England. Capital which had been\r\ninvested in shipping now sought larger returns in the manufacture of\r\nthose commodities hitherto supplied by British factories. When the\r\nembargo was laid, only fifteen cotton mills were in operation,\r\nrepresenting a capital of about $500,000. Two years later, capital to\r\nthe amount of $4,000,000 had been invested in factories which employed\r\nnearly 4000 hands. At the close of the war, $40,000,000 were invested in\r\ncotton mills which consumed 27,000,000 pounds of raw cotton and gave\r\nemployment to 100,000 men and women. Hitherto much of the weaving had\r\nbeen done on hand looms in the farmhouses of New England: only the\r\nspinning had been done by machinery. In 1814, Francis Lowell introduced\r\nthe power loom into his mill at Waltham, Massachusetts, and brought the\r\nvarious processes of cotton manufacturing under one roof. The foundation\r\nof the New England factory system was thus laid before the end of the\r\nwar. In the following decade the famous factory towns on the Merrimac\r\ncame into existence. The metamorphosis of the section had begun.\r\n\r\nThe woolen industry received a great impetus in this same period of\r\nartificial stimulation, but it failed to expand with the same rapidity,\r\nowing to the scarcity and cost of the finer grades of wool.\r\nNevertheless, in the year 1816, about $12,000,000 were invested in the\r\nmanufacture of woolen fabrics. Like the cotton industry, this owed its\r\ndevelopment to the policy of Presidents from Virginia. It is one of the\r\nironies of history that Jefferson and Madison should have unwittingly\r\nsacrificed Southern planters to build up industries in the North, and\r\nthat New Englanders should have excoriated those worthies for policies\r\nwhich became the source of New England prosperity.\r\n\r\nTo these new industries peace spelled disaster. English manufacturers\r\nseized the opportunity to unload the goods which they had been piling up\r\nin their warehouses for years. Importations which had amounted to\r\n$13,000,000 in 1813 rose to the staggering sum of $147,000,000 in 1816.\r\nNot even import duties stemmed the tide, for as Lord Brougham stated in\r\nParliament, \"It was well worth while to incur a loss upon the first\r\nexportation, in order, by a glut, to stifle in the cradle those rising\r\nmanufactures in the United States which the war had forced into\r\nexistence, contrary to the natural course of things.\"\r\n\r\nIn October, 1815, the cotton manufacturers of Rhode Island sent a\r\nmemorial to Congress, stating that their one hundred and forty factories\r\nwere threatened with destruction by this cut-throat competition. Such\r\ncomplaints seemed unduly apprehensive; yet before the year closed, most\r\nof the textile mills had shut down. The distress of New England was no\r\nlonger feigned. Caught in a process of transition from shipping to\r\nmanufacturing, capital could neither advance nor retreat. It was a\r\nlegitimate case for governmental aid. Even Jefferson laid aside his\r\nearly prepossessions in favor of a simple bucolic life for the American\r\ncitizen, and admitted that \"to be independent for the comforts of life,\r\nwe must fabricate them for ourselves. We must now place the manufacturer\r\nby the side of the agriculturist.\" Madison, too, departed from the\r\nVirginia faith so far as to recommend sufficient protection of \"the\r\nenterprising citizens whose interests are now at stake\" to guard them\r\n\"against occasional competition from abroad.\"\r\n\r\nWithin sight of the blackened walls of the Capitol, in temporary\r\nquarters which it had rented, Congress set its hand to the work of\r\nnational reconstruction. Before many months had passed, the new Capitol,\r\nunder the supervision of Latrobe, began to rise from the ruins of the\r\nold, a symbol of a new era. On the walls of the rotunda, John Trumbull\r\npainted scenes which were to remind coming generations of the heroic\r\ndays of the Revolution, and within its confines was eventually installed\r\nwhat was left of the library of Congress, with the gaps supplied in part\r\nby Jefferson's private collection, which Congress purchased. The new\r\nnation was not to disdain wholly the finer aspects of life nor to\r\ndespise the garnered wisdom of the ages.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1816, Congress took under consideration a tariff bill which\r\nhad been drafted on lines marked out by the new Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, A. J. Dallas, of Pennsylvania. The debates brought out a wide\r\ndiversity of interests. Daniel Webster represented admirably the mingled\r\nfeelings of his New England constituents when he professed to favor\r\nexisting manufactures, but deprecated any action calculated to produce\r\nnew industries. He never wished to see the time when the young men of\r\nthe country would be forced to close their eyes to heaven and earth, and\r\nopen them in the dust and smoke of unwholesome factories. On the other\r\nhand, Calhoun, eschewing a narrow sectionalism, declared that\r\nmanufacturing must be encouraged as a wise national policy. \"Neither\r\nagriculture, manufactures, nor commerce, taken separately, is the cause\r\nof wealth,\" said he. \"It flows from the three combined and cannot exist\r\nwithout each.\" The South showed little of the apprehension which John\r\nRandolph expressed when he cried, \"Upon whom bears the duty on coarse\r\nwoolens and linens and blankets, upon salt, and all the necessaries of\r\nlife?\" and answered, \"On poor men, and on slaveholders.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill which Congress eventually passed fixed somewhat lower duties\r\nthan Dallas had advised. A duty of twenty-five per cent was placed on\r\ncotton and woolen goods until June 30, 1819, when it was to be reduced\r\nto twenty per cent. By what was known as the minimum principle, all\r\ncotton fabrics costing less than twenty-five cents a square yard were\r\nheld to have cost that amount and were made to pay corresponding duties.\r\nThe object of this provision was to exclude from India the coarser and\r\ncheaper cotton textiles which would menace the products of New England\r\nlooms. Other important articles were made subject to higher duties, such\r\nas rolled and hammered iron, leather goods, hats, carriages, and\r\nwriting-paper. A comparison of these duties with those of the tariff of\r\n1789 shows a marked increase. Where the average duty was seven and one\r\nhalf per cent in 1789, it was thirty per cent in the tariff of 1816. So\r\nfar as the intent of the law is concerned, this tariff act committed the\r\ncountry to a fiscal policy in which \"revenue was subordinated to\r\nindustrial needs.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the largest vote against the tariff bill came from the South\r\nand Southwest, twenty-three out of fifty-seven Representatives voted for\r\nthe bill. New England showed a prepondering opinion in favor of\r\nprotection: only ten out of twenty-seven Representatives opposed the\r\nbill. The Representatives of the Middle States ranged themselves\r\nemphatically on the side of protection; and with them stood the\r\nCongressmen from Ohio and Kentucky.\r\n\r\nThe close of the war found the country with a badly disordered currency\r\nand with a bankrupt treasury. Nowhere were the remedial efforts of\r\nCongress needed more. The condition of the currency was due, in part at\r\nleast, to the failure of Congress in 1811 to perceive the regulative\r\ninfluence of a national bank. By refusing to recharter the United States\r\nBank, Congress not only deprived the Treasury of an exceedingly valuable\r\nfiscal agent during the war, but also threw the door wide open to\r\nindiscriminate and unregulated state banking. Between 1811 and 1816 the\r\nnumber of these state institutions increased from eighty-eight to two\r\nhundred and forty-six, all of which exercised the right of issuing notes\r\nwith little or no restriction. Inflation followed inevitably. During the\r\nblockade the banks of the Middle and Southern States suffered great\r\ndistress by the constant drain of specie to New England and abroad.\r\nAfter the capture of Washington, practically all banks outside of New\r\nEngland were forced to suspend specie payments. The country experienced\r\nonce more all the evils of a depreciated currency. Southern bank notes\r\nwere refused for deposit in Philadelphia banks. Notes of these\r\ninstitutions in Philadelphia, in turn, were subject to a discount of\r\ntwenty-four per cent in Boston. Uncertainty and distrust demoralized\r\nfinancial operations everywhere.\r\n\r\nWiser by the experience of five years, Congress was now disposed to\r\nestablish another national bank. A first bill, however, fell short of\r\nthe President's desires and was vetoed. A second bill became law on\r\nApril 10, 1816. The provisions of this Bank of the United States\r\ndiffered in several particulars from that chartered in 1790. Its capital\r\nwas three and one half times as large. One fifth of the total capital\r\nof $35,000,000 was to be subscribed by the Government, and the remainder\r\nby individuals. Five of the twenty-five directors were to be appointed\r\nby the President of the United States. The funds of the Government were\r\nto be deposited in the Bank unless the Secretary of the Treasury should\r\notherwise direct, laying his reasons for any such change before\r\nCongress. In return for the privileges granted in the charter, the Bank\r\nwas required to transfer the government funds from place to place\r\nwithout charge, and to pay $1,500,000 to the Government. On its side the\r\nGovernment agreed not to charter any other bank except in the District\r\nof Columbia. The circulation of the Bank was limited to the amount of\r\nits capital. Its notes were to be payable on demand in specie and to be\r\nreceivable in all payments to the Government.\r\n\r\nSuch an institution gave promise of serving the Government as a sound\r\nfiscal agent and of assisting materially in the restoration of the\r\ncurrency to a specie basis. The stock was subscribed promptly by 31,334\r\nindividuals, all but three thousand of whom resided in the Middle\r\nStates. New England was still reluctant to support the plans of Mr.\r\nMadison; the South had other uses for its capital. To facilitate the\r\nresumption of specie payments, Congress passed a joint resolution, that\r\nafter February 20 of the following year (1817), all dues to the\r\nGovernment should be paid in specie, treasury notes, national bank\r\nnotes, or notes of banks payable in the \"said currency of the United\r\nStates.\" This was strong medicine for the state banks. Unwilling or\r\nunable to contract their circulation and to call in their loans, the\r\nbanks of the Middle States asked to have the date of resumption\r\ndeferred, on the ostensible ground that the new bank could not be\r\norganized in time to assist them. The energetic Secretary of the\r\nTreasury disposed of this plea by putting the Bank in operation in\r\nJanuary, 1817. On the date set by Congress the banks very generally\r\nresumed specie payments.\r\n\r\nThe propulsive force given to the Government by the war seemed likely to\r\ncontinue. The task of the National Government no longer seemed merely\r\nnegative,--to \"restrain men from injuring one another,\" in the\r\nJeffersonian phrase,--but positive and constructive. Even Madison, in\r\nhis annual message of 1815, recommended liberal provision for defense,\r\nmore military academies, an improved and enlarged navy, protection to\r\nmanufactures, new national roads and canals, and a national university.\r\nHe gave his support to Monroe's proposal to fix the peace establishment\r\nat twenty thousand men; and he experienced the unique sensation of\r\nfinding himself in advance of his party, which finally agreed upon an\r\narmy of ten thousand men. Still more striking evidence of the change\r\nwhich had passed over the party of Jefferson was its willingness to\r\nretain the entire naval establishment and to appropriate $4,000,000 for\r\nfrigates and ships-of-the-line. Clay and Calhoun, speaking for the\r\nyounger Republicans, agreed that the greatest danger of the future lay\r\nin weak government. They were not in the least intimidated by the\r\naddition of $80,000,000 to the national debt as the result of war. That\r\nsum represented to their minds simply the price, none too large, of\r\ncommercial and industrial independence.\r\n\r\nThese young aggressive spirits seemed at times quite indifferent to nice\r\nquestions of constitutional law. Calhoun dismissed constitutional\r\nobjections to a national bank with a wave of the hand: he thought\r\ndiscussion of such abstract themes \"a useless consumption of time.\" On\r\nintroducing his bill for internal improvements, in December, 1816, he\r\nintimated that he did not propose to indulge in metaphysical subtleties\r\nrespecting the Constitution. \"The instrument was not intended as a\r\nthesis for the logician to exercise his ingenuity on; ... it ought to be\r\nconstrued with plain good sense.\" If Clay exhibited more sensitiveness\r\nto constitutional limitations, it was because he had to clear himself\r\nfrom the charge of inconsistency. In supporting the Bank Bill in 1816 he\r\nfrankly confessed that he had changed his mind on the point of\r\nconstitutionality. He had believed the incorporation of a bank in 1811\r\nunwarranted by the Constitution; but conditions had changed. What was\r\nthen neither necessary nor proper was now both necessary and proper. The\r\ninterpretation of the Constitution must always take existing\r\ncircumstances into account. If Clay did not add to his reputation as an\r\nexpounder of the Constitution by this speech, he represented admirably,\r\nnevertheless, the changes which circumstances had wrought in the\r\nconvictions of his associates.\r\n\r\nAgainst these new tendencies John Randolph set himself stark and grim.\r\n\"The question is,\" said he, replying to Calhoun's new nationalism,\r\n\"whether or not we are willing to become one great consolidated nation,\r\nor whether we have still respect enough for those old, respectable\r\ninstitutions [the States] to regard their integrity and preservation as\r\na part of our policy.\" Randolph spoke for a generation which was passing\r\naway; but his words touched a responsive chord in the breast of\r\nPresident Madison. On March 3, 1817, as he was about to leave office, he\r\nsent to Congress a message vetoing the Internal Improvements Bill and\r\nwarning his party associates of the danger of latitudinarian views of\r\nthe Constitution. This message was Madison's farewell address. It was\r\nthoroughly characteristic of the man and the statesman.\r\n\r\nThe relaxing of Republican doctrines, and of party ties generally,\r\ndivested the presidential election of any real political significance.\r\nThe Federalists were thoroughly discredited. As a party they made no\r\nconcerted effort to nominate candidates. Virtually, therefore, the\r\nselection of a President rested with the congressional caucus of the\r\nRepublican party. The choice lay between two members of the President's\r\nCabinet: James Monroe, Secretary of State, and William H. Crawford,\r\nSecretary of the Treasury. Governor Tompkins, of New York, was put\r\nforward by enthusiastic partisans from that State, but he was not a\r\nnational figure in any sense and commanded no support outside of his\r\nState. Intrigue played a part in this caucus, if contemporary testimony\r\nmay be believed. Tradition has it that Martin Van Buren and Peter B.\r\nPorter prevented their New York delegation from voting for Crawford and\r\nthus threw the nomination to Monroe. Governor Tompkins was the choice of\r\nthe caucus for Vice-President. No one could safely affirm that these\r\nnominees were the choice of the rank and file of the party. Here and\r\nthere public meetings were held to protest against the dictation of the\r\ncongressional caucus; but no organized opposition developed. The\r\ncampaign proved to be a tame affair. Nowhere was there a real contest.\r\nOnly three States, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Delaware, chose\r\nFederalist electors. Not a ripple of excitement stirred the public when\r\nannouncement was finally made that Monroe had received 183 electoral\r\nvotes and Rufus King, 34. For the fourth time a Virginian had been\r\nraised to the Presidency.\r\n\r\n\r\n     BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\r\n\r\n     Of the general histories, only that by McMaster contains any great\r\n     amount of information bearing on the economic changes wrought by\r\n     war and the preceding period of commercial restriction. Adams\r\n     summarizes the economic results of war in a single chapter in the\r\n     last volume of his work. K. C. Babcock, _The Rise of American\r\n     Nationality_ (in _The American Nation_, vol. 13, 1906), attempts\r\n     the same task. Besides the manuals on economic history which have\r\n     already been mentioned, there are several excellent volumes\r\n     dealing with various phases of national life: such as, D. R.\r\n     Dewey, _Financial History of the United States_ (1903); F. W.\r\n     Taussig, _Tariff History of the United Stales_ (rev. ed., 1913);\r\n     R. C. H. Catterall, _The Second Bank of the United Stales_ (1903);\r\n     J. L. Bishop, _History of American Manufactures from 1608-1860_ (2\r\n     vols., 1861-64); C. W. Wright, _Wool-Growing and the Tariff_\r\n     (1910). Among the biographies of statesmen of the new generation,\r\n     the best are: G. T. Curtis, _Life of Daniel Webster_ (2 vols.,\r\n     1869); W. W. Story, _Life and Letters of Joseph Story_ (2 vols.,\r\n     1851); G. Hunt, _John C. Calhoun_ (1908).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE WESTWARD MOVEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of the second decade of the nineteenth century, the people of\r\nthe United States were still in the main a homogeneous folk, native-born\r\ndescendants of native-born ancestors. The tide of immigration which was\r\nby the end of the century to inundate the nation and transform its\r\ncharacter was just beginning to flow. Its volume between the close of\r\nthe Revolution and the year 1820, when the first official statistics\r\nwere collected, must remain a matter of conjecture. In 1817, the\r\npainstaking Niles, in his _Register_, estimated that about twenty-two\r\nthousand immigrants had arrived in that year in the ports of New York,\r\nPhiladelphia, and Boston, of whom four thousand were Germans and the\r\nrest inhabitants of the British Isles. Fully one half of these British\r\nsubjects were brawny Irishmen, often a turbulent lot, but always in\r\ndemand for hard labor on the roads and canals which were projected in\r\nevery part of the Union. Among these newcomers, however, were many\r\nundesirables. Not a few English parishes emptied their poorhouses by\r\nsending the helpless inmates to the New World. Some of these deported\r\npaupers, no doubt, found a livelihood and became respectable citizens;\r\nbut the records of almshouses in the Eastern States indicate that many\r\nof these unfortunates had only exchanged one asylum for another. In the\r\nPhiladelphia poorhouses in the early thirties, from one third to one\r\nhalf of the inmates were foreign-born. Cargoes of redemptioners came\r\ninto American ports as late as the year 1818. Of that traffic which was\r\nbringing helpless Africans into bondage in the Southern States, more\r\nwill be said in a subsequent chapter.\r\n\r\nAmong the new arrivals, it goes without saying, were men and women, who,\r\nand whose descendants, contributed mightily to the building up of\r\nAmerican Commonwealths. Entire communities seeking an asylum in the New\r\nWorld continued to arrive as in the early years of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. In 1817, a body of German separatists from Wuerttemberg, under\r\nthe leadership of Joseph Baumeler, landed at Philadelphia. Like the\r\nEnglish Pilgrims they sought freedom from religious persecution, but the\r\nPlymouth which they founded was on a new frontier--at Zoar in the\r\nwilderness of Ohio.\r\n\r\nWhat particularly impressed every foreign traveler in America during\r\nthese years of transition and expansion was the incessant movement of\r\nsociety. The earlier westward movement of population had never wholly\r\nceased, but it had been retarded by the war. The return of peace was\r\nlike the first warm days of spring. The roads leading West were fairly\r\ninundated by a swelling stream of emigrants. An observer at the Genesee\r\nturnpike noted a train of some twenty wagons and one hundred and sixteen\r\npersons on their way to Indiana from a single town in Maine. A traveler\r\non his way from Nashville to Georgia, in January, 1817, met an\r\nastonishing number of people from the Carolinas and Georgia who were\r\nbound for the cotton lands of Alabama. He counted over two hundred\r\nconveyances and three thousand people, driving herds of cattle and\r\ndroves of hogs before them. But the great highway to the West lay\r\nthrough Pennsylvania. On the road from Chambersburg to Pittsburg,\r\nFearon, an intelligent and in such particulars a trustworthy English\r\ntraveler, counted one hundred and three stage-wagons, drawn by four and\r\nsix horses, proceeding from Philadelphia and Baltimore to Pittsburg, and\r\nseventy-nine wagons bound in the opposite direction. \"On the road,\"\r\ncomments Fearon, \"every emigrant tells you he is going to Ohio; when you\r\narrive in Ohio, its inhabitants are 'moving' to Missouri and Alabama;\r\nthus it is that the point for final settlement is forever receding as\r\nyou advance, and thus it will hereafter proceed, and only be terminated\r\nby that effectual barrier--the Pacific Ocean.\"\r\n\r\nTo this emigration all sections of the Union contributed. In the\r\nback-country of New England--in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and\r\nwestern Massachusetts--was a restive population little loved by the\r\ngoverning class. President Timothy Dwight, of Yale College, described\r\nthese people as \"impatient of the restraints of law, religion, and\r\nmorality,\" contentious, always complaining, and always indebted. They\r\nwere likely to be Baptists or Methodists, by persuasion, and Democrats\r\nin politics. As small farmers their lot was a hard one. They needed only\r\nthe incentive of cheap lands in the West to sever the slender ties which\r\nbound them to the stony hillsides of New England. Yet the older towns of\r\nNew England also complained of the Western fever which was carrying off\r\nthe available labor supply. Fearon found \"the small and middling\r\ntradesmen\" always ready to sell out when business got bad and \"pack up\r\nfor the back-country.\" The immediate destination of these New Englanders\r\nwas western New York. Within a decade what had been a frontier area was\r\nfilled with an industrious population eager to secure markets for the\r\nsurplus products of their farms.\r\n\r\n[Map: Land Sales and Land Offices to 1821]\r\n\r\nBefore a very large number of New Englanders passed beyond western New\r\nYork, emigrants from the Middle States were pushing into the Ohio\r\ncountry, where Harrison's victories had opened vast tracts to the white\r\nsettlers. The earliest settlers in Indiana and Illinois, however, were\r\nof Southern extraction. Tennessee and Kentucky, having no longer a\r\nsupply of good land at low prices, sent the younger generation on to a\r\nnew frontier. In the year 1816 the father of Abraham Lincoln took his\r\nfamily across the Ohio on a raft and hewed his way into the timber lands\r\nalong the river bottoms of Indiana. With these migratory Kentuckians\r\nwent also descendants of the Germans and the Scotch-Irish who had\r\npeopled the Great Valley in the previous century. Even from the\r\nCarolinas came all sorts and conditions of men,--poor whites, Quakers,\r\nBaptists,--small farmers whom the advancing plantation system was\r\ndriving from the uplands.\r\n\r\nEven more significant than this advance of population into the region\r\nnorth of the Ohio was the contemporaneous movement from the Southern\r\nSeaboard States into the cotton lands of the Gulf plains. The way had\r\nbeen prepared by Andrew Jackson's conquest of the Creeks. Alabama was\r\nthe immediate goal of the migrating Southerner. From Kentucky, also, but\r\nmore particularly from Tennessee, stalwart pioneers entered this new El\r\nDorado. The father of Jefferson Davis was one of those who tried their\r\nluck in the alluvial plains of the lower Mississippi. By the year 1820,\r\nthe area of settlement had extended from southern Tennessee to Mobile,\r\nand from Mobile to the Mississippi along the Gulf.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Cotton Crop in the United States 1801-1834\r\n  Based on Estimates furnished to Congress by the Secretary of Treasury\r\n  Figures indicate the crop in million pounds\r\n  Shaded segments indicate the Gulf States]\r\n\r\nThe causes and consequences of this colonization of the Southwest form a\r\nvital chapter in the economic history of the country. In the year before\r\nthe war, Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia produced 75,000,000 pounds\r\nof cotton; the only other cotton-raising States, Tennessee and\r\nLouisiana, produced 5,000,000 pounds. Ten years later, the Seaboard\r\nStates raised 117,000,000 pounds; the Southwest, 60,000,000. In another\r\ndecade the States of the Southwest had outstripped the Old South. This\r\ncomparison throws a flood of light upon Southern history. The invention\r\nof the cotton gin had made possible the cultivation of the short-staple\r\ncotton plant, which was the only variety that could be raised profitably\r\nin the uplands. Occurring just at the moment when the use of the power\r\nloom in factories was giving an unprecedented stimulus to the\r\nmanufacture of cotton, the cotton gin worked a revolution in Southern\r\nlife and industry. From the tidewater, with its large plantations\r\nworked by African slaves, the cultivation of cotton passed into the\r\nregion above the fall-line of the rivers, where the small farmer\r\npracticed a diversified agriculture. Socially and politically the two\r\nregions had always been distinct. The gentlemen planters of the\r\ntidewater, with much the same outlook as the English gentry of the same\r\nperiod, regarded the democratic yeomen of the Piedmont with distrust not\r\nunmixed with contempt. By excluding them from their proportionate\r\nrepresentation in the state legislatures, the aristocratic planters\r\nmaintained an ascendency which was at once political and social. But as\r\ncotton-growing became more profitable and advanced into the interior,\r\nthe farmer of the uplands found himself pushed to the wall. Either he\r\nmust adopt the plantation system and purchase slaves, or sell his land\r\nand move on. For want of capital large numbers chose the latter\r\nalternative and swelled the numbers of those who had already set their\r\nfaces westward.\r\n\r\nThe communities which within six years after the Treaty of Ghent were\r\nadmitted into the Union as the States of Mississippi and Alabama, did\r\nnot at first differ materially from Indiana and Illinois, which became\r\nCommonwealths at the same time. Much the same obstacles confronted the\r\npioneer in the pine forests of Mississippi as in the hard woods of the\r\nNorthwest. Either as squatter or _bona fide_ purchaser he had with the\r\naid of his neighbors hewed out a clearing, or single-handed girdled the\r\ntrees, and laid the sills of his log cabin. A \"raising\" or \"frolic\" was\r\none of the few opportunities for social intercourse in the hard life of\r\nthe frontiersman. Between the stumps of his clearing he planted his\r\nfirst crop of Indian corn; and what the soil did not yield for his\r\nsustenance, he supplied with his trusty rifle. Time wrought vast\r\ntransformations in these new communities. The thriftless, who scratched\r\nthe surface of the ground and then sold out to a newcomer of sterner\r\nfiber, passed on to a new frontier. Log cabins gave way to frame houses.\r\nClearings became well-tilled farms. Better methods of cultivation\r\nextracted a surplus of produce which could be sent to market. Along the\r\nrivers of the Northwest, cities sprang up like mushrooms.\r\n\r\nFrom this point the history of the Southwest diverged from that of the\r\nNorthwest. The virgin lands of the Gulf attracted also the planter with\r\nhis capital invested in African slaves. Once again the small farmer felt\r\nthe combined pressure of social and economic forces. He saw his\r\nwealthier neighbor acquire the more fertile lands; he found himself\r\nthrust into a socially inferior class; and again he yielded to fate.\r\nWhile a democratic society of self-reliant yeomen was developing in the\r\nnorthern half of the Mississippi Valley, a society based upon a\r\nplantation economy and aristocratic in its outward characteristics was\r\nforming in the Gulf States. Yet in its aggressiveness and commercial\r\nenterprise, the new South resembled the Northwest rather than the old\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\n[Map: The West as an Economic Section in 1820]\r\n\r\nWhile the South was producing staples for an ever-growing market, it\r\nbecame itself the market for the surplus products of the Northwest. An\r\nactive internal trade sprang up between the sections in spite of the\r\nnatural barriers to commercial intercourse. Live stock could be driven\r\nto market. It was a common occurrence to see droves of thousands of\r\n\"razor-back\" hogs on their way from Kentucky to the Seaboard States,\r\nfeeding on nuts and roots by the way. Rivers were the chief highways for\r\nsuch produce as could not provide for its own locomotion. The Western\r\nwaters floated all sorts of craft, from the lumber raft to the flatboat,\r\nladen with pork, cheese, butter, flour, corn, and whiskey. The greater\r\npart of these boats were makeshifts, and made no return voyage. It was\r\nnot until 1809 that a barge was warped upstream from New Orleans to\r\nNashville. The entire traffic on the Mississippi and the Ohio was\r\ncarried on until 1817 in less than a score of keel boats, which made the\r\nvoyage downstream from Louisville to New Orleans in about forty days,\r\nand upstream in ninety. When, then, a steamboat succeeded in making a\r\nreturn voyage in twenty-five days, it was hailed as an epoch-making\r\nperformance. In the next year twenty steamboats were competing for the\r\nriver traffic; and three years later (1820) seventy-two were in actual\r\nservice. Yet the steamboat did not drive the flatboat from the Western\r\nrivers. So late as 1840 one fifth of the freight handled on the lower\r\nMississippi was carried in flatboats or barges.\r\n\r\nThe rapid rise of this internal commerce between the farmer of the\r\nNorthwest and the cotton planter of the South increased the ability of\r\nboth to purchase manufactures in the Eastern markets. Both sections had\r\nwants which they could not supply by their simple household industries.\r\nThey had to import not only their farming implements, but most of those\r\narticles, useful or ornamental, which were thought indispensable to a\r\nhigher civilization. \"Spots in Tennessee, in Ohio, and Kentucky,\"\r\ncomments an English traveler, \"that within the lifetime of even young\r\nmen, witnessed only the arrow and the scalping knife, now present the\r\ntraveler with articles of elegance and modes of luxury which might rival\r\nthe displays of London and Paris.\" Most of this stock was transported\r\nover the mountains from Philadelphia or Baltimore. In 1820, three\r\nthousand wagons carried to Pittsburg, the distributing center of the\r\nWest, nearly eighteen million dollars' worth of merchandise.\r\n\r\nThe commercial interests of the East were quick to see the possibilities\r\nof this new market. An eager rivalry sprang up between the merchants of\r\nNew York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. Everywhere ways and means of\r\ncheaper transportation were discussed. In this subject the Western\r\nfarmer was vitally interested, for freight charges added nearly one\r\nthird to the cost of merchandise transported over the mountains. The\r\ncotton planter of the Seaboard States, also, feeling the competition of\r\nthe Southwest, where riverways were abundant and easily navigable, saw\r\nthe need of better roads to tidewater, in order to lessen the cost of\r\nmarketing his produce.\r\n\r\nThe popular demand for better roads was not recent. All the States had\r\nencouraged, directly or indirectly, the building of turnpikes and\r\nbridges. Between 1793 and 1812, Pennsylvania had chartered fifty-five\r\nturnpike companies, and other States had been scarcely less ready to\r\ngrant articles of incorporation to stock companies. Private enterprise\r\nhad, indeed, done much to improve communication along the seaboard.\r\nTurnpikes and bridges had shortened the journey by stage from Boston to\r\nWashington to four and a quarter days by the year 1815. The city of New\r\nYork was in 1816 within twenty-four hours of Albany by the Hudson River\r\nsteamboats.\r\n\r\nNumerous canal companies had also been chartered; but of all the canals\r\nprojected, only three had been completed when the War of 1812 began: the\r\nDismal Swamp Canal in Virginia, the Santee Canal in South Carolina, and\r\nthe Middlesex Canal in Massachusetts. It remained for New York to usher\r\nin a new era in internal communication by authorizing in 1817 the\r\nconstruction of the Erie Canal. In the ardent imagination of its chief\r\npromoter, De Witt Clinton, this canal was destined to be \"a bond of\r\nunion between the Atlantic and Western States\" and \"an organ of\r\ncommunication between the Hudson, the Mississippi, the St. Lawrence, the\r\nGreat Lakes of the North and West, and their tributary rivers,\" creating\r\n\"the greatest inland trade ever witnessed\" and transforming New York\r\ninto a vast emporium of commerce and \"the granary of the world.\"\r\n\r\nThis bold bid for Western trade alarmed the merchants of Philadelphia,\r\nparticularly as the completion of the national road threatened to divert\r\nmuch of their traffic to Baltimore. In 1825, the legislature of\r\nPennsylvania grappled with the problem by projecting a series of canals\r\nwhich were to connect its great seaport with Pittsburg on the west and\r\nwith Lake Erie and the upper Susquehanna on the north.\r\n\r\nThe magnitude of the transportation problem was such, however, that\r\nneither individual States nor private corporations seemed able to meet\r\nthe demands of an expanding internal trade. As early as 1807, Albert\r\nGallatin had advocated the construction of a great system of internal\r\nwaterways to connect East and West, at an estimated cost of $20,000,000.\r\nBut the only contribution of the National Government to internal\r\nimprovements during the Jeffersonian era was an appropriation in 1806 of\r\ntwo per cent of the net proceeds of the sales of public lands in Ohio\r\nfor the construction of a national road, with the consent of the States\r\nthrough which it should pass. By 1818 the road was open to traffic from\r\nCumberland, Maryland, to Wheeling, Virginia.\r\n\r\nIn 1816, with the experiences of the war before him, no well-informed\r\nstatesman could shut his eyes to the national aspects of the problem.\r\nEven President Madison invited the attention of Congress to the need of\r\nestablishing \"a comprehensive system of roads and canals.\" Soon after\r\nCongress met, it took under consideration a bill drafted by Calhoun\r\nwhich proposed an appropriation of $1,500,000 for internal improvements.\r\nBecause this appropriation was to be met by the moneys paid by the\r\nNational Bank to the Government, the bill was commonly referred to as\r\nthe \"Bonus Bill.\" \"Let it not be forgotten,\" said Calhoun in advocacy of\r\nhis bill, \"that it [the size of the Union] exposes us to the greatest of\r\nall calamities,--next to the loss of liberty,--and even to that in its\r\nconsequences--disunion. We are great, and rapidly--I was about to say\r\nfearfully--growing. This is our pride and our danger; our weakness and\r\nour strength.... We are under the most imperious obligation to\r\ncounteract every tendency to disunion.... Whatever impedes the\r\nintercourse of the extremes with this, the center of the Republic,\r\nweakens the Union.\"\r\n\r\nThe one section which was impervious to these national considerations at\r\nthis moment was New England; but it was President Madison, and not New\r\nEngland, who defeated the Bonus Bill. On the day before he left office,\r\nMadison sent to Congress a notable veto message. Reverting to his\r\nearlier faith, he pronounced the measure unconstitutional. Neither the\r\nexpress words of the Constitution nor any fair inference could, in his\r\njudgment, warrant the exercise of such powers by Congress. To pass the\r\nbill over his veto was impossible. Monroe, too, in his first message to\r\nCongress intimated that he also held strict views of the powers of\r\nCongress. The policy of internal improvements by Federal aid was thus\r\nwrecked on the constitutional scruples of the last of the Virginia\r\ndynasty.\r\n\r\nHaving less regard for consistency, the House of Representatives\r\nrecorded its conviction, by close votes, that Congress could appropriate\r\nmoney to construct roads and canals, but had not the power to construct\r\nthem. As yet the only direct aid of the National Government to internal\r\nimprovements consisted of various appropriations, amounting to about\r\n$1,500,000 for the Cumberland Road.\r\n\r\nCircumstances were also pressing the claims of the Far West upon the\r\nGovernment. Beyond the scattered settlements of Illinois and Indiana\r\nextended vast forests, known only to the Indians and the fur traders.\r\nWith the experiences of the war fresh in mind, the new Secretary of War,\r\nCalhoun, urged upon the Government the necessity of taking resolute\r\nmeasures to hold this territory. Laws excluding foreigners from the\r\nIndian trade were passed; forts were established at strategic points\r\nlike Chicago, Prairie du Chien, and Green Bay; and in 1820, Governor\r\nCass, of the Michigan Territory, was sent on an expedition through the\r\nWisconsin forests into Minnesota, to assert American claims wherever\r\nBritish influence was still felt.\r\n\r\nStill farther west lay an almost unknown region of imperial dimensions.\r\nSave where venturesome pioneers had pushed up the Arkansas and the\r\nMissouri, and where the Spaniards maintained their feeble hold in the\r\nSouthwest, no white men inhabited the great prairies which swept\r\nwestward to the foothills of the Rockies. Only nomadic Indian tribes and\r\noccasional traders followed the buffalo trails across this wide expanse.\r\nBetween the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific was the region which Lewis\r\nand Clark had penetrated. Along the valley of the northern branch of the\r\nColumbia River, the Hudson's Bay Company had planted their trading\r\nposts. Farther to the south lay Spanish California and the ill-defined\r\nregion to the eastward over which _presidios_ maintained a shadowy\r\njurisdiction.\r\n\r\nOn October 20, 1818, Benjamin Rush and Albert Gallatin, ministers to\r\nEngland and France respectively, concluded a convention with Great\r\nBritain which left the fate of the Oregon country in suspense for a\r\nperiod of ten years. To the British claims of prior discovery by Cook\r\nand Mackenzie and of prior occupation by the Hudson's Bay Company, the\r\nAmerican commissioners opposed the claims based on the voyage of Captain\r\nGray in 1792 and on the founding of Astoria by John Jacob Astor in 1811.\r\nIt was finally agreed that the northern boundary of the United States\r\nshould run from the Lake of the Woods to the Stony Mountains, along the\r\nforty-ninth parallel, and that the disputed country beyond the mountains\r\nshould be occupied jointly for a period of ten years. An agreement was\r\nalso reached regarding the Newfoundland and Labrador fisheries.\r\n\r\nOn another frontier conditions existed to which Congress could not\r\nremain indifferent. East Florida was still a thorn in the side of\r\nGeorgia and Alabama. The province had become a rendezvous for pirates,\r\nfilibusters, renegade Indians, and runaway negroes. Creek warriors who\r\nwould not submit to the loss of their lands had taken refuge with their\r\nkinsmen, the Seminoles, and were inciting malcontents of every stripe\r\nagainst the whites. A band of negroes, estimated at not less than a\r\nthousand in number, together with some Creek Indians, had taken\r\npossession of an abandoned fort on the Apalachicola and had terrorized\r\nthe country for miles around. The Spanish commander at Pensacola was\r\nsummoned to destroy this pirates' nest and to disperse the marauders;\r\nbut he was either unable or unwilling to do so, and in 1816 a red-hot\r\nshot from a United States gunboat blew up the magazine of the negro\r\nfort, killing nearly three hundred men, women, and children. Early in\r\n1818, in equally summary fashion troops of the United States expelled a\r\nband of freebooters from Amelia Island.\r\n\r\nThe slight regard which the United States paid to the territorial\r\nsovereignty of Spain in Florida sprang from a general conviction that\r\nSpain could not and would not observe the provisions of the Treaty of\r\n1795. Spain had then agreed to restrain the Indians living within her\r\nborders from attacking the citizens or Indians of the United States.\r\nPresident Monroe seemed to assume that Spain had forfeited her rights\r\nover Florida. At all events, he authorized General Andrew Jackson to\r\nassume command of the forces at Fort Scott and to call on the governors\r\nof adjacent States for militia to terminate the war. This order of\r\nDecember 26, 1817, was stated in dangerously broad terms. Jackson did\r\nnot doubt for an instant that it authorized him to pursue the Indians\r\ninto Florida. To his mind the time seemed opportune for the seizure of\r\nEast Florida as an indemnity for the outrages committed by the\r\nSeminoles. He wrote to the President to this effect. \"Let it be\r\nsignified to me,\" said he, \"through any channel (say Mr. J. Rhea) that\r\nthe possession of the Floridas would be desirable to the United States\r\nand in sixty days it will be accomplished.\"\r\n\r\nTo his dying day Jackson maintained that the President signified his\r\napproval through Congressman Rhea, of Tennessee. Monroe denied that he\r\nhad read Jackson's letter until after the exploits which so nearly\r\nplunged the country into war with Spain. Whatever may be the truth of\r\nthe matter, General Jackson acted in accord with what he believed to be\r\nthe President's desires. With a thousand men he marched across the\r\nborder and was soon in possession of St. Mark's. Among those who fell\r\ninto his hands was Alexander Arbuthnot, a Scotch trader who was\r\nsuspected of inciting the Indians. Continuing his march, Jackson\r\nsurprised and captured Suwanee, another rendezvous of Indians and\r\nrunaway negroes. Here he found Robert Ambrister, another British\r\nsubject, who was also regarded as a suspicious character. Returning to\r\nSt. Mark's, Jackson handed these two suspects over to a court martial,\r\nwhich found both guilty of giving aid and comfort to the enemy and of\r\ninciting or waging war against the United States. Arbuthnot was hanged\r\nfrom the yardarm of his own schooner; Ambrister was shot. The fall of\r\nPensacola finished the campaign. By the end of May, 1818, Florida was in\r\nthe possession of the troops of the United States and Jackson was on his\r\nway to Tennessee, the idol of his men and a national hero in the\r\nestimation of the people of the Southwest.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of these exploits might easily have been war with both Spain\r\nand Great Britain. Don Luis de Onis, the Spanish Minister at Washington,\r\nimmediately suspended the negotiations then in progress respecting the\r\nFloridas and made a spirited protest \"against these acts of hostility\r\nand invasion.\" He demanded the immediate restitution of the places which\r\nhad been seized, indemnity for all damage to property, and the\r\npunishment of General Jackson. As for Great Britain, Lord Castlereagh\r\nafterward said that, such was the temper of Parliament and the country,\r\nwar might have been produced by holding up a finger and an address to\r\nthe Crown carried by an almost unanimous vote.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet of President Monroe was divided over the course to be\r\npursued. Calhoun insisted that Jackson had virtually committed an act of\r\nwar, which should be promptly disavowed. But Adams held--and the\r\nPresident was inclined to side with him--that in reality Spain had been\r\nthe aggressor, and that Jackson had not violated the spirit of his\r\norders. In order to terminate the war, Jackson had been obliged to cross\r\nthe Spanish line. He had not done so with the purpose of waging war upon\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\n[Map: Treaty with Spain 1819]\r\n\r\nFollowing a memorandum made by the President, Adams replied to Don Onis\r\nin this spirit. Later, in a masterly state paper, he set forth the\r\nintolerable conditions which obtained on the Florida frontier. The lax\r\nconduct of the Spanish authorities was held to justify the aggressive\r\nmeasures of Jackson. The United States was prepared to restore Pensacola\r\nand St. Mark's whenever Spain should give guaranties for the observance\r\nof treaty obligations. So far from consenting to punish Jackson, the\r\nUnited States demanded the punishment of those Spanish officials who had\r\nso flagrantly violated the obligations of the Treaty of 1795. \"Spain\r\nmust immediately make her election either to place a force in Florida at\r\nonce adequate for the protection of her territory and to the fulfillment\r\nof her engagements, or cede to the United States a province of which she\r\nretains nothing but the nominal possession.\" This latter alternative,\r\nindeed, the Administration never lost from view.\r\n\r\nConfronted by the revolt of all her American colonies, Spain could\r\nhardly resist this insistent pressure upon a province which she could\r\nneither govern nor defend. On February 22, 1819, Don Onis set his hand\r\nto a treaty which ceded the Floridas in return for the assumption by the\r\nUnited States of claims of American citizens against her to an amount\r\nnot exceeding $5,000,000. The treaty contained also a definition of the\r\nboundary between Spanish and American possessions on the North American\r\ncontinent. Beginning at the mouth of the Sabine River, the line ran\r\nalong that river to the thirty-second parallel; thence due north to the\r\nRed River, which it followed to the hundredth meridian; thence north to\r\nthe Arkansas and along that river to its source; thence to the\r\nforty-second parallel, which it followed to the Pacific. As the United\r\nStates renounced all claims to the west and south of this boundary, so\r\nSpain surrendered whatever shadowy title she had to the Northwest.\r\n\r\nThe ratification of the Florida Treaty was delayed by the attempt of the\r\nSpanish Crown to grant extensive tracts to certain grandees, and by the\r\nvigorous opposition of Henry Clay in the House of Representatives. The\r\ntreaty seemed to him a bad bargain. \"What do we get?\" he cried. \"We get\r\nFlorida loaded and encumbered with land grants which leave scarcely a\r\nfoot of soil for the United States. What do we give? We give Texas free\r\nand unencumbered, and we surrender all our claims on Spain for damages\r\nnot included in that five millions of dollars.\" He challenged the right\r\nof the President and Senate to alienate territory without the consent of\r\nthe House. Behind Clay's opposition lay some personal pique against the\r\nPresident and his Secretary of State; but he voiced, nevertheless, the\r\nspirit of the Southwest, which already looked toward Texas as a possible\r\nfield of expansion and resented its surrender.\r\n\r\n\r\n     BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\r\n\r\n     The westward movement is described in various chapters of volumes\r\n     IV and V of McMaster, _History of the People of the United\r\n     States_. The significance of the movement is best explained in F.\r\n     J. Turner, _Rise of the New West, 1819-1829_ (in _The American\r\n     Nation_, vol. 14, 1906), which contains also excellent chapters on\r\n     the social and economic life of the different sections of the\r\n     country. The highways and waterways to the West are described in\r\n     A. B. Hurlbert, _Historic Highways of America_ (10 vols.,\r\n     1902-05). A summary account of the development of transportation\r\n     is given in J. L. Ringwalt, _Development of Transportation Systems\r\n     in the United States_ (1888). Among the biographies which\r\n     contribute materially to an understanding of the new West may be\r\n     mentioned Theodore Roosevelt, _Thomas H. Benton_ (1887), and James\r\n     Parton, _Life of Andrew Jackson_ (3 vols., 1860). Edward\r\n     Eggleston, _The Circuit Rider_ (1888), and the _Autobiography of\r\n     Peter Cartwright_ (1856), touch upon important aspects of frontier\r\n     life. The importance of the German element in American history is\r\n     admirably set forth in Faust, _The German Element in the United\r\n     States_ (2 vols., 1909). The spread of New Englanders in the West\r\n     is described by L. K. Mathews, _The Expansion of New England_\r\n     (1909). The diplomatic negotiations which resulted in the cession\r\n     of Florida are reviewed by F. E. Chadwick, _The Relations of the\r\n     United States and Spain_ (1909).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nHARD TIMES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe phrase \"era of good feelings\" applied to the Administration of\r\nPresident Monroe is a misnomer. It is descriptive neither of politics\r\nnor of business and industry, for the historic Democratic party was all\r\nbut rent by bitter personal animosities, and the country was prostrated\r\nby a severe industrial crisis.\r\n\r\nThe first symptoms of hard times appeared in the early months of the\r\nyear 1819. Undoubtedly the causes of the crisis were world-wide; but\r\nlocal conditions go far to explain the industrial collapse in the United\r\nStates. All indications point to the conclusion that the country was\r\nexperiencing the inevitable reaction from a period of too rapid\r\ncommercial expansion and of unsound speculation. The high prices of\r\ncommodities after the war had given a sort of fictitious prosperity to\r\nindustry and trade, and had encouraged unduly the spirit of commercial\r\nenterprise. On credit easily secured from wild-cat banks, the Western\r\npioneer had bought lands beyond the purchasing power of his own meager\r\ncapital; and the speculator in turn had borrowed money to secure title\r\nto lands which he would unload upon unsuspecting settlers. State banks\r\nhad met these demands by liberal issues of notes which were imperfectly\r\ncovered by their specie reserves. It needed only a sudden demand for\r\nliquidation to cause widespread distress.\r\n\r\nThe unwise management of the National Bank may have contributed to the\r\napproaching disaster. The branch banks in the South and West had loaned\r\nfreely, issuing notes which were payable at any branch of the National\r\nBank. Capital was thus diverted from the East to sections of the country\r\nwhere there was least conservatism in banking. In 1818, the directors of\r\nthe Bank became alarmed at the excessive expansion of credit, and issued\r\ninstructions which compelled the redemption of notes at the bank where\r\nthey were issued. At the same time the branch banks curtailed their\r\nloans. This sudden reversal of policy caused a fearful pressure which\r\nwas transmitted from creditor to debtor all along the line.\r\n\r\nEvery sufferer by the panic was disposed to blame the National Bank for\r\nhis misfortunes, particularly as it was common rumor that the directors\r\nof the Bank had speculated in its stock and had used their influence to\r\ncripple local banks. Congress had been obliged to take cognizance of\r\nthese charges and to appoint a committee to investigate the condition of\r\nthe institution. On the report of this committee, in January, 1819, the\r\nstock of the Bank fell from 140 to 93. The investigation revealed\r\nnothing worse than mismanagement; but a vigorous effort was made in\r\nCongress to revoke the charter.\r\n\r\nThe widespread hostility of the West and South toward the National Bank\r\nwas born at this time. Everywhere it was known as \"the Monster.\" State\r\nafter State passed acts to tax the branch banks out of existence. The\r\ndecision of Chief Justice Marshall, to be sure, in the famous case of\r\n_M'Culloch_ v. _Maryland_, declared emphatically that the States had no\r\nconstitutional power to tax the branches of an institution chartered\r\nunder the laws of the United States; nevertheless, the legislature of\r\nOhio deliberately levied such a tax, and when resistance was offered to\r\nits collection, withdrew the protection of the State from the branch\r\nbanks. Feeling themselves the victims of the money power, the people in\r\nmany of the Western States resorted to the remedies which were broached\r\nduring hard times under the Confederation. Kentucky became notorious by\r\nreason of its laws in behalf of the debtor class. In every Western State\r\nthere was a disposition to seek shelter from the operation of federal\r\nlaw behind the aegis of State rights. The people of these newer\r\ncommunities were slow to accept the force of precedent in cases decided\r\nby the federal courts. Andrew Jackson voiced this feeling when he became\r\nPresident. \"Mere precedent,\" said he, \"is a dangerous source of\r\nauthority, and should not be regarded as deciding questions of\r\nconstitutional power, except where the acquiescence of the people and\r\nthe States can be considered as well settled.\"\r\n\r\nThat there was much real suffering during this panic admits of no doubt.\r\nNiles estimated that not less than twenty thousand persons were seeking\r\nemployment in Philadelphia in the summer of 1819, and quite as many\r\nwandering in the streets of New York looking for work. In both cities\r\nsoup-houses were established by private charitable societies to relieve\r\ndistress in the following winter. In the city of New York, during the\r\nyear 1816, over nineteen hundred unfortunates were imprisoned for debt;\r\nand of these, over seven hundred owed less than twenty-five dollars.\r\n\r\nBut it was not merely the city dweller who felt the pinch of poverty.\r\nThousands of Western settlers who had purchased land under the Act of\r\n1800, which permitted deferred payments, found themselves insolvent.\r\nMore than $21,000,000, one fifth of the national debt, remained unpaid\r\nin the year 1820. To the importunities of these debtors Congress had\r\nyielded from time to time, but it was not until 1821 that it passed the\r\nfirst general relief act. Those who had not completed their payments\r\nwithin the prescribed five years were then permitted to give up the land\r\nwhich they had not paid for, and to apply the payments already made to\r\nthe full purchase of the lands which they retained. Arrears of interest\r\nwere remitted.\r\n\r\nIn 1820, Congress passed an act which wrought a far-reaching change in\r\nthe disposal of the public domain. The credit system was abolished\r\noutright. After July 1, 1820, land was to be sold for cash at a minimum\r\nprice of a dollar and a quarter an acre, and in eighty-acre tracts. A\r\npayment of one hundred dollars, then, would make a settler the owner of\r\neighty acres in his own right. The prospect of actual ownership of a\r\nsmall tract made him far less ready to listen to the voice of the\r\ntempter in the form of the speculator, who had heretofore lured him to\r\nmake larger purchases on credit than he could ever pay for by the labor\r\nof his hands.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this period of financial depression, the Territory of\r\nMissouri applied for admission into the Union. On February 13, 1819,\r\nwhile an enabling act was under consideration in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, James Tallmadge, of New York, moved an amendment which\r\ntouched Southern interests to the quick. \"_And provided_, That the\r\nfurther introduction of slavery or involuntary servitude be prohibited,\r\nexcept for the punishment of crimes, whereof the party shall have been\r\nduly convicted; and that all children born within the said State, after\r\nthe admission thereof into the Union, shall be free at the age of\r\ntwenty-five years.\"\r\n\r\n[Map: Distribution of Slaves 1820]\r\n\r\nThis bold attempt to prevent the spread of slavery provoked a brief but\r\nmomentous debate. Clay left the Speaker's chair to remonstrate, \"in the\r\nname of humanity,\" against a policy which could result, he believed,\r\nonly in the misery of the slaves of the South. The lot of the negro\r\nwould be vastly improved if the unfortunate people were more widely\r\ndispersed. Taylor, of New York, called this a specious plea. \"It is that\r\nhumanity,\" said he, \"which seeks to palliate disease by the application\r\nof nostrums, which scatter its seeds through the whole system.\" To open\r\nthe West to slavery would be simply to create an additional demand for\r\nthe importation of slaves. Of those Southern Representatives who took\r\npart in this debate, not a man posed as the defender of slavery in the\r\nabstract. Barbour, of Virginia, frankly admitted that slavery \"like all\r\nother human things is mixed with good and evil--the latter, no doubt,\r\npreponderating.\" And Johnson, of Kentucky, maintained that though\r\nslavery might be a necessary evil, \"not incompatible with true\r\nreligion,\" even so \"slavery must still be a bitter draught.\"\r\n\r\nWhat rankled in the breasts of all Southern men was the insinuation that\r\ntheir social system was founded on hypocrisy and tyranny. Tallmadge\r\ncommented with biting sarcasm on the willingness of Southern gentlemen\r\nto contribute to missionary enterprises for the uplifting of the\r\nHottentots and Hindus, and their determination to keep their African\r\nslaves in ignorance. And his colleague contrasted the plantations,\r\noverrun with weeds on one side of Mason and Dixon's line, with the\r\ncultivated farms on the other: in Pennsylvania, he observed \"a neat,\r\nblooming, animated, rosy-cheeked peasantry\"; in Maryland, \"a squalid,\r\nslow-motioned black population.\" These were barbed shafts which left\r\nsore wounds.\r\n\r\nWhen the Union was formed, African negroes were held in servitude in\r\nall but two of the States. At the time of this debate, slavery had been\r\nabolished, or was on the way to ultimate extinction, in every State\r\nnorth of Maryland and Delaware. Climate rather than humanitarian\r\nconsiderations sealed the fate of slavery at the North; and climate, in\r\nthe last analysis, fastened African slavery on the South. As the South\r\nbecame committed to the raising of a staple, and that staple cotton, the\r\nnegro was regarded as an indispensable factor in plantation economy.\r\nThere were far-sighted individuals, it is true, who deprecated slavery\r\non humanitarian grounds; but they were, for the most part, citizens of\r\nborder States where the profitableness of negro labor was less apparent.\r\nEven in these communities opposition to slavery was tempered by dread of\r\nwhat emancipation might bring in its train. The history of Santo Domingo\r\nrevealed the hideous possibilities of a negro insurrection. No father of\r\na family could contemplate with equanimity the proximity of a large body\r\nof free, semi-civilized blacks. For a time even prominent slaveholders\r\nfavored the aims of the Colonization Society which proposed to deport\r\nemancipated blacks to the African coast. So late as 1820 the Governor of\r\nVirginia recommended an appropriation by the legislature for the\r\nemancipation and removal of the negroes.\r\n\r\nAlthough slavery was a local institution, and regulated by state law,\r\nits existence was recognized by the Federal Convention of 1787. The\r\narrangement which obtained under the old Confederation, whereby five\r\nslaves were to count as three whites in apportioning representation and\r\ntaxes, was continued; the mutual obligation of the States to return\r\nfugitives from justice and labor was distinctly stated in the\r\nConstitution; and the slave trade was permitted to continue at least to\r\nthe year 1808.\r\n\r\nIn 1793, Congress had met its constitutional obligations by enacting a\r\nlaw for the return of fugitive slaves; and in 1794, Congress passed an\r\nact--\"the first national act against the slave trade\"--which prohibited\r\nall trade in slaves from the United States to any foreign country. By\r\nthe opening of the new century all the States had forbidden the\r\nimportation of slaves from abroad. But in 1803, South Carolina again\r\nlegalized the slave trade; and in 1805, Congress after a brief\r\ninterdiction removed all restrictions upon the importation of slaves\r\ninto the Louisiana Territory. The slave trade at once assumed alarming\r\nproportions. It was officially stated that between 1803 and 1807, 39,075\r\nnegroes were brought into the port of Charleston. Eighteen hundred of\r\nthese unfortunate blacks were imported in American vessels. One half of\r\nthe consignees of these slavers were Americans, of whom thirteen were\r\nnatives of Charleston and eighty-eight of Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nThis traffic, coupled with the alarm caused by negro insurrections in\r\nthe West Indies, prepared the public mind for positive action, as the\r\nyear approached when Congress might constitutionally prohibit the\r\nforeign slave trade. The Act of March 2, 1807, however, only partially\r\nmet the expectations of the anti-slavery people. The African slave\r\ntrade was forbidden, but negroes illegally imported were to be disposed\r\nof as the legislatures of the several States should determine. There was\r\nreason to fear that the Southern States would neglect to legislate on\r\nthis important matter, and that the act would be indifferently enforced.\r\nMoreover, the coastwise slave trade for purposes of sale was not\r\ninterdicted, but forbidden only in vessels under forty tons burden.\r\n\r\nThat the Act of 1807 did not prevent the African slave trade was patent\r\nto every one who knew conditions in the Southern Seaboard States; but\r\nthe extent of this traffic can only be surmised. During the debates on\r\nthe Missouri Bill, Tallmadge stated that fourteen thousand negroes had\r\nbeen brought into the country within the last year, and the statement\r\nwas not challenged.\r\n\r\nWhen the Missouri controversy was renewed in the session of December,\r\n1819, the number of free States equaled the number of slave States. The\r\naddition of a twenty-third State, then, would unsettle the equilibrium\r\nbetween the sections in the Senate. A growing antagonism based upon\r\nwidely different economic and social organizations was coming to be\r\nfelt--felt rather than clearly perceived and openly recognized. In the\r\nyear 1800, the two sections had been nearly equal in population; in\r\n1820, the North outnumbered the South by over half a million. This\r\ndisparity in numbers had a direct political significance, for the\r\nnational House of Representatives was beyond all question controlled by\r\nthe delegations from the free States. No great prescience was needed to\r\nwarn the South that in self-defense it must maintain the even balance\r\nof sections in the Senate. The contest for Missouri was therefore\r\nessentially \"a struggle for sectional domination.\"\r\n\r\nThe Tallmadge amendment was passed by the House, but rejected by the\r\nSenate, after a heated debate which convinced Southern statesmen that\r\nthere was a distinct anti-slavery sentiment at the North. The\r\nadjournment of Congress threw the whole controversy into the crucible of\r\npublic opinion. The latent hostility of men and women with humanitarian\r\nsympathies was at once raised to white heat. Mass meetings in city,\r\ntown, and county passed resolutions against the spread of slavery and\r\nthe admission of more slave States. Yet it can hardly be said that the\r\npublic conscience was deeply touched. The leaven of abolitionism had to\r\nwork many years before it could produce results in politics.\r\n\r\nThe whole question assumed a new guise when Congress met in December,\r\n1820. The people of Maine had held a convention and formed a\r\nconstitution, and were now applying for admission as a State. Here was a\r\nfree State which would offset Missouri if it were admitted as a slave\r\nState. When the House passed a bill to admit Maine, the Senate promptly\r\nattached to it, as a \"rider,\" a bill for the admission of Missouri\r\nwithout any prohibition of slavery. It was to this bill that Senator\r\nThomas, of Illinois, representing a constituency divided against itself\r\non the subject of slavery, offered an amendment in the nature of a\r\ncompromise. He would admit Missouri as a slave State, but prohibit\r\nslavery forever in the rest of the old Province of Louisiana north of\r\n36 deg. 30'. The Senate accepted this amendment and sent the bill to the\r\nHouse. Here the original Maine Bill was stripped of the rider and the\r\nThomas amendment by large majorities. Shortly after this vigorous\r\nassertion of independence, the House passed a bill for the admission of\r\nMissouri with the prohibition of slavery. The deadlock seemed complete.\r\n\r\nThe constitutional aspects of the problem called forth some exceedingly\r\nable argumentation. Those who favored imposing a restriction upon\r\nMissouri argued, plausibly enough, that as Congress was given the power\r\nto admit new States, so it was fully warranted in exercising discretion\r\nand refusing to admit. Precedents existed for imposing restrictions.\r\nThree States carved out of the Northwest Territory had been admitted on\r\ncondition that their constitutions should not be repugnant to the sixth\r\narticle of the Ordinance of 1787. The State of Louisiana had been\r\nadmitted under explicit conditions. It was fully competent for Congress,\r\nby virtue of its authority over Territories, to regulate all the stages\r\nin the process of framing a constitution, and then to give or to\r\nwithhold its approval.\r\n\r\nThe most brilliant argument on the other side was made by William\r\nPinkney, of Maryland. Conceding that the power of Congress was\r\ndiscretionary, he insisted that Congress might not exact terms which\r\nwould interfere with the results to be accomplished. \"What, then,\" he\r\nasked, \"is the professed result? To admit a State into this Union. What\r\nis that Union?... An equal Union between parties equally sovereign....\r\nIt is into that Union that a new State is to come. By acceding to it\r\nthe new State is placed on the same footing with the original States....\r\nIf it comes in shorn of its beams--crippled and disparaged beyond the\r\noriginal States--it is not into the original Union that it comes.... The\r\nfirst was a Union _inter pares_; this is a Union between _disparates_,\r\nbetween giants and a dwarf, between power and feebleness, between full\r\nproportioned sovereignties and a miserable image of power.\"\r\n\r\nYet there were Senators and Representatives from the North who would not\r\nbe diverted from the discussion of the larger sectional and ethical\r\nissues involved in the extension of slavery. Chief among these was Rufus\r\nKing, who then represented New York in the Senate. His cogent arguments\r\nmade a profound impression. \"The great slaveholders in the House,\" Adams\r\nwrote in his journal, \"gnawed their lips and clenched their fists as\r\nthey heard him.\"\r\n\r\n[Map: House Vote on the Missouri Compromise March 2, 1820]\r\n\r\nMeantime, a joint committee of conference was endeavoring to reconcile\r\nthe differences between the House and the Senate. The House was put at a\r\ndisadvantage by the approach of March 4--when the consent of\r\nMassachusetts to the admission of Maine would expire. It was finally\r\nagreed that the Senate should pass the bill admitting Maine as a\r\nseparate measure, while the House should accept the Missouri Bill with\r\nthe Thomas amendment. Missouri, in short, was to come in as a slave\r\nState, but slavery was forever prohibited in the rest of the Louisiana\r\nPurchase north of her southern boundary. An analysis of the voting in\r\nthe House of Representatives reveals no clear-cut sectional divisions,\r\nthough it forecasts a time when slavery might split parties along\r\nsectional lines. In New England and the Middle States public opinion had\r\nnot yet crystallized into inflexible opposition to the spread of\r\nslavery; but the Northwest was distinctly in favor of a restriction upon\r\nMissouri. The Southwest and the South were a unit in desiring the\r\nadmission of Missouri as a slave State.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1820, the Missouri question in another form returned to\r\nvex Congress. When the constitution of the State was presented to\r\nCongress, it was found to contain a clause which excluded free negroes.\r\nAgain the two houses locked horns. Passions rose again. The work of the\r\npreceding session seemed about to be undone. But under the persuasive\r\nleadership of Henry Clay, a joint committee elaborated a resolution\r\nwhich was acceptable to both houses. Missouri was to be admitted on the\r\nexpress condition that the offending clause in her constitution should\r\nnever be construed so as to authorize the passing of any law by which\r\nany citizen of any of the States of the Union should be deprived of his\r\nprivileges and immunities under the Federal Constitution. The\r\nlegislature of Missouri was to give its solemn consent to this\r\nfundamental condition. Then, and not until then, the President was to\r\ndeclare Missouri a member of the Union. The State complied with the\r\nrequirement, though in the same breath protesting that all this was an\r\nempty form, since Congress could not thus bind a State. On August 10,\r\n1821, President Monroe declared Missouri a State of the Union.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this exciting controversy, Monroe was reelected\r\nPresident. Nowhere but in Pennsylvania was there any serious opposition.\r\nOld distinctions of party had so far disappeared that the venerable\r\nex-President John Adams was chosen as a presidential elector in\r\nMassachusetts, and voted with his fourteen colleagues--who were half\r\nFederalists and half Democrats--for James Monroe. In the electoral count\r\nMonroe lacked only a single vote of a unanimous election.\r\n\r\nWhen the electoral vote was about to be counted, an embarrassing\r\nquestion arose with regard to the vote of Missouri. As the State had not\r\nyet complied with the condition imposed by Congress, its right to vote\r\nwas challenged. Again Clay appeared in his role of compromiser. The\r\ndelicate question was adroitly avoided by having the President of the\r\nSenate announce the electoral vote with and without the votes of\r\nMissouri. At last the Missouri question was disposed of; but words had\r\nbeen uttered which could not be recalled; and wounds had been inflicted\r\nwhich left scars. The South could never quite forget that it had been\r\ncharged with conniving at crime in maintaining slavery. \"You have\r\nkindled a fire,\" said Cobb, of Georgia, to Tallmadge, \"which all the\r\nwaters of the ocean cannot put out, which seas of blood only can\r\nextinguish.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\r\n\r\n     An account of the crisis of 1819 is contained in F.

In throwing off the shackles of British commercial\r\nascendency, American society experienced much the same sense of elation\r\nand liberation as the peoples of Europe who contemporaneously rose in\r\ntheir might against Napoleon and asserted their right to independent\r\nnational existence. The war was followed in the United States by an\r\nexpansion of the vital forces of the nation in all directions. The\r\nearliest manifestations of this new national consciousness, however,\r\nwere characteristically boisterous. An English traveler, who visited the\r\nUnited States soon after the war, found every man, woman, and child\r\ntalking about the Guerriere, the Java, the Macedonia, the Frolic, Lake\r\nErie, Lake Champlain, and the \"vast inferiority of British sailors and\r\nsoldiers to the true-blooded Yankees.\" The events of the war were\r\ncommemorated in songs which this Briton declared--and no doubt\r\ntruthfully--to be \"frothy, senseless bombast.\" But whatever limitations\r\nof culture were disclosed by this outburst of national conceit, no one\r\ncould doubt for an instant that an exuberant vitality was coursing\r\nthrough the veins of the nation.\r\n\r\nIt was a fair question, however, whether this national feeling would\r\nfind expression in any permanent literary form. A literature of its own\r\nAmerica did not possess: every one with literary tastes was forced to\r\nthis humiliating admission. Writing from Berlin in 1801, John Quincy\r\nAdams hailed the first number of Dennie's _Port Folio_ with delight.\r\n\"The object,\" he declared, \"is noble. It is to take off that foul stain\r\nof literary barbarism which has so long exposed our country to the\r\nreproach of strangers and to the derision of our enemies.\" But the\r\nperiodical had a very limited circle of readers, and its literary merits\r\nwere slight. The _Anthology and Boston Review_, founded in 1805, had a\r\nwider influence upon letters in America; but it is memorable chiefly as\r\nthe forerunner of the _North American Review_, modeled upon the English\r\nquarterlies, which was first published by William Tudor, in the year\r\n1815, at Boston.\r\n\r\nThe publication of American books at this time was a hazardous\r\nenterprise. \"The successful booksellers of the country,\" wrote one who\r\nrecalled his own experiences in the book trade, \"were for the most part\r\nthe mere reproducers and sellers of English books.\" Yet American\r\npublishers often showed commendable enterprise. In 1817, Byron's\r\n_Manfred_ was received, printed, and published at Philadelphia in a\r\nsingle day. Walter Scott, Moore, Miss Edgeworth, Miss Porter, and Lord\r\nByron were the favorite British novelists and poets whose writings were\r\nreprinted in America. Among the American publications advertised by\r\nbooksellers, were sermons, geographies, and schoolbooks; but rarely any\r\nproductions which belonged to the category termed by contemporaries\r\n_belles-lettres_.\r\n\r\nThe slender literary product of the United States from 1815 to 1830 is\r\ncontained in magazines rather than in books. Prose and verse which could\r\nnever have found a publisher separately appeared in periodicals of every\r\ndescription. Most of these were ephemeral publications. The more serious\r\nreviews, like the _American Biblical Repository_, the _American Law\r\nJournal_, and the religious reviews, had a longer life; but the lighter\r\nmagazines, like the _Ladies' Literary Cabinet_, the _Young Ladies'\r\nParental Mentor_, and the _Casket: or Flowers of Literature, Wit, and\r\nSentiment_, rose and fell on the fickle tide of public taste. Even the\r\nWest had its magazines. Lexington, Kentucky, which disputed with\r\nCincinnati the proud title, \"Athens of the West,\" published the _Western\r\nReview_, one number of which contained a review of _Don Juan_ within six\r\nweeks after the poem was published in England.\r\n\r\nIn the September number of the _North American Review_, in 1817,\r\nappeared an original poem of such merit as to mark an era in the history\r\nof American verse. There was in William Cullen Bryant's _Thanatopsis_,\r\nit is true, no such youthful exuberance of feeling as the first\r\nstirrings of poetic genius in a new world might be expected to exhibit.\r\nThe sense of refined form seemed almost un-American; yet there are lines\r\nin the poem which suggest the primeval background of American life and\r\nits influence upon the American mind. In 1819 appeared Washington\r\nIrving's _Sketch-Book_--the first American book which was widely read\r\nin England; and in 1821, Cooper published _The Spy_, which was the first\r\nto win favor on the Continent. Both Cooper and Irving were more or less\r\nconscious imitators of English prose writers, the one of Scott and the\r\nother of Addison; and they lacked consequently that originality which\r\ncritics have always demanded as the hall-mark of a genuinely native art.\r\nIt is easy to forget, however, that the Americans were not a primitive\r\npeople. They were folk with a literary inheritance, of which albeit they\r\noften showed little knowledge. It was not for them to invent new forms,\r\nbut to press new wine into old bottles. Of Irving, moreover, it should\r\nbe said that he drew freely upon a vein of delicious humor, as in his\r\n_Knickerbocker History of New York_, which may be truly characterized as\r\nAmerican.\r\n\r\nThe annals of American art in these years are even more bare. Benjamin\r\nWest, to be sure, was born in Pennsylvania, but he achieved eminence in\r\nEngland. That he could succeed Sir Joshua Reynolds as President of the\r\nRoyal Academy was a tribute to his fame, but equally convincing proof\r\nthat he had ceased to be identified with the land of his nativity.\r\nGilbert Stuart owed much to West, but his return to America in 1792\r\nsaved him from complete subservience to English models. As a portrait\r\npainter he developed power and individuality. Posterity may well be\r\ngrateful that the portraits of Washington, Jefferson, and Madison were\r\npainted with fidelity to nature as Stuart saw it, rather than in the\r\ngrandiose manner of West. Two other names, Malbone and Allston, deserve\r\nbrief mention. The one achieved some distinction as a painter of\r\nminiatures; the other is remembered both as artist and man of letters in\r\nthe literary circle which was forming about Boston. The name of Jonathan\r\nTrumbull completes the list of American artists. What David was to the\r\ngreat actors in the revolutionary drama in France, Trumbull was to the\r\nnotable characters of the American Revolution. In his conception of his\r\nthemes he was perhaps the most genuinely American painter of his time.\r\n\r\nIn the pages of his autobiography, Trumbull recounts an interview with\r\nhis father which may take the place of any further comment on the dearth\r\nof artistic feeling in the United States. The young man was arguing\r\npassionately for his vocation. The father, a typical Yankee, listened\r\nwith commendable patience, and complimented the lad when he had\r\nfinished. \"'But,' added he, 'you must give me leave to say, that you\r\nappear to have overlooked, or forgotten, one very important point in\r\nyour case.' 'Pray, sir,' I rejoined, 'what was that?' 'You appear to\r\nforget, sir, that _Connecticut is not Athens_'; and with this pithy\r\nremark, he bowed and withdrew, and nevermore opened his lips upon the\r\nsubject. How often have those few impressive words recurred to my\r\nmemory.\"\r\n\r\nThe names of Bryant, Cooper, and Irving are linked with the city of New\r\nYork which enjoyed for a brief time that primacy in the world of\r\nAmerican letters which it was fast acquiring in commerce. The center of\r\nliterary and scholarly activity in the next generation was Boston,\r\nwhere the New England renaissance began. In this revival of letters\r\nHarvard College had a notable part. In 1806, John Quincy Adams was\r\nappointed Professor of Rhetoric and gave a course of lectures which\r\nmoulded the taste of that school of orators to which Edward Everett\r\nbelonged--a school of oratory which found its models in Demosthenes and\r\nCicero. Everett became Professor of Greek in 1815; and George Ticknor,\r\nProfessor of Belles-Lettres in 1816. Prescott graduated in 1814, Palfrey\r\nin 1815, and George Bancroft in 1817,--all three to add to American\r\nhistoriography works of enduring excellence. In 1817, young Ralph Waldo\r\nEmerson entered college.\r\n\r\nIt was Boston, however, rather than Harvard College, which\r\ncreated the atmosphere that these young scholars--all from Boston\r\nfamilies--breathed: for the Athenaeum, the American School of Arts and\r\nSciences, and the Massachusetts Historical Society had begun to exercise\r\nan increasing influence on the younger generation. Harvard College, like\r\nall colleges of the day, was hardly more than a species of higher\r\nacademy whither boys went at a tender age to continue their study of the\r\nclassics and mathematics, and incidentally to cultivate rhetoric and\r\n_belles-lettres_.\r\n\r\nThe liberation of the American mind from time-honored traditions and\r\nconventions appeared markedly in the ecclesiastical revolts and\r\nreligious revivals of the age. Unitarianism took its rise quite as much\r\nin protest against the teaching of Calvinism, that man was brought into\r\nthe world hopelessly depraved, as against the orthodox conception of\r\nChrist's nature. The definite separation of Unitarianism from\r\nCongregationalism dates from 1815 when William E. Channing published his\r\nmemorable letter to the Reverend Samuel C. Thacher. The writings of\r\nBuckminster, Channing, and other theological liberals have a distinct\r\nplace in the annals of American intellectual life. Universalism also\r\ntook its rise at this time and spread with remarkable rapidity under the\r\nlead of Hosea Ballou. In western Pennsylvania and Virginia, the\r\nCampbells, father and son, led a departure from the established\r\nPresbyterian order. The Society of Friends was also rent by the\r\nteachings of Elias Hicks.\r\n\r\nRevivals had been a recurring feature of New England religious life\r\nsince the latter years of the seventeenth century. That they stimulated\r\nmany forms of religious activity appears in the annals of missionary\r\nenterprises at home and abroad. In 1810 the American Board of Foreign\r\nMissions and in 1814 the American Baptist Missionary Union were founded.\r\nIn 1812 four young missionaries went out to India; and five years later\r\nother devoted young men began their labors among the Cherokees and\r\nChoctaws of the Southwest. There is something at once heroic and\r\npathetic in the humanitarian zeal of a people, whom Europeans still\r\nregarded with disdain, to carry to the remote ends of the earth a\r\nChristian civilization which they had themselves hardly attained. But an\r\nincomprehensible idealism has from first to last been interwoven in the\r\ntexture of American character.\r\n\r\nAfter the cessation of European wars the United States stood singularly\r\naloof from the Old World, yet in the affairs of South America they did\r\nnot cease to take a lively interest. The successive revolutions by which\r\nthe provinces of the Rio de la Plata, Chili, Peru, Colombia, Brazil, and\r\nMexico threw off the yoke of Spain woke a thrill in the people of the\r\nUnited States, for they thought they saw the events of their own\r\nrevolution repeated in the exploits of San Martin and Bolivar. To the\r\nimagination of Henry Clay, this was a sublime spectacle--\"eighteen\r\nmillions of people struggling to burst their chains and be free.\" He\r\nwould have had the United States recognize these sister republics and\r\njoin hands with them in forming an American system independent of\r\nEurope. And when the Administration hesitated, he exclaimed: \"We look\r\ntoo much abroad. Let us break these commercial and political fetters;\r\nlet us no longer watch the nod of any European politician; let us become\r\nreal and true Americans, and place ourselves at the head of the American\r\nsystem.\"\r\n\r\nThe conception of an American system did not originate in the ardent\r\nmind of Henry Clay. It was as old as the Union itself. Foreign\r\nencroachment had been feared from the very birth of the nation. \"You are\r\nafraid of being made the tool of the powers of Europe,\" said Richard\r\nOswald to John Adams while peace negotiations were pending at Paris.\r\n\"Indeed I am,\" rejoined Adams. \"What powers?\" asked Oswald. \"All of\r\nthem,\" said Adams; \"it is obvious that all the powers of Europe will be\r\ncontinually manoeuvring with us to work us into their real or\r\nimaginary balances of power.... But I think that it ought to be our rule\r\nnot to meddle.\" Washington's refusal to enter into an alliance with\r\nFrance and his firm insistence upon neutrality were inspired by this\r\nsame fear. Jefferson's negotiations for the purchase of New Orleans were\r\nmotivated by the fear that France, once in possession of the mouth of\r\nthe Mississippi, would threaten the isolation of the United States and\r\ndrive us into the arms of Great Britain. \"Jefferson is an American,\"\r\nAdet once said, with rare insight, \"and by that title, it is impossible\r\nfor him to be sincerely our friend. _An American is the born enemy of\r\nEuropean peoples._\"\r\n\r\nThe corollary of the principle of non-intervention was abstention on the\r\npart of the United States from the affairs of Europe. Could the United\r\nStates, then, recognize the colonies of Spain as independent republics\r\nwithout emerging from its traditional isolation? President Monroe would\r\nhave been glad to recognize the South American republics even before\r\nthey had demonstrated their ability to maintain their independence; but\r\nhis cool-headed Secretary of State prevailed upon him to await further\r\nevidence. It was not until 1822, indeed, that the President recommended\r\nto Congress the establishment of missions in the new republics of South\r\nAmerica. Spain protested emphatically against this action; but Adams,\r\nnow sure of his ground, justified the action of the Administration by an\r\nappeal to facts. So long as Spain was attempting to reduce the colonies\r\nby arms, the United States had observed \"the most impartial neutrality.\"\r\nBut war had ceased, and the United States had \"yielded to an obligation\r\nof duty of the highest order, by recognizing, as independent states,\r\nnations which, after deliberately asserting their right to that\r\ncharacter, had maintained and established it against all the resistance\r\nwhich had been or could be brought to oppose it.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year 1823, the traditional principles of American foreign policy\r\nwere put to a severer test. Soon after the Congress of Vienna, that\r\ncombination of the great powers was consummated which contemporaries\r\nusually but erroneously styled the Holy Alliance. Austria, Prussia,\r\nRussia, and Great Britain covenanted together to meet at fixed periods\r\nto consult upon their common interests and to consider the measures\r\n\"most salutary for the repose and prosperity of nations, and for the\r\nmaintenance of the peace of Europe.\" Three years later, France was\r\nadmitted to the councils of these \"self-appointed keepers of the world's\r\npeace.\" Innocent enough in its public professions, this association of\r\nthe great powers was converted by Metternich of Austria, who had\r\nacquired a remarkable ascendency over the mind of his own sovereign and\r\nover that of the impressionable czar, into an instrument of reaction and\r\nrepression, whenever and wherever the specter of revolution raised its\r\nhead. Within a few years revolutionary uprisings occurred in Italy and\r\nSpain. The so-called legitimate sovereigns were driven from their\r\nthrones and constitutional governments were established. In successive\r\ncongresses at Troppau and Laybach, the three powers, Austria, Russia,\r\nand Prussia, resolved to suppress these revolutionary movements. An\r\nAustrian army was commissioned to carry out this policy of intervention,\r\nas it was termed; and the King of the Two Sicilies was restored to his\r\nuneasy throne. Neither Great Britain nor France took part in these\r\ncongresses. It now remained to chastise the revolutionists of Spain. At\r\nthe Congress of Verona in 1822, the representative of Great Britain\r\nopenly protested against any intervention in Spain. But again the three\r\npowers, now joined by France, resolved to restore the deposed Fernando\r\nVII. Early in the following year a French army crossed the Pyrenees and\r\nentered Madrid. It was commonly believed that the restoration of the\r\nmonarchy was to be followed by a reduction of the revolted colonies and\r\na restoration of the Spanish colonial empire.\r\n\r\nIt was at this juncture that Canning, who had become the head of the\r\nBritish ministry, protested against the policy of intervention and\r\nsought for ways and means to make the protest effective. The one power\r\nwhose traditions of liberty and whose interests in this particular\r\nseemed to be identical with those of Great Britain was the United\r\nStates. In truth, their interests were far from being identical. Two\r\nyears before, in a conversation with the British minister at Washington,\r\nthe Secretary of State, in his most uncompromising manner, had\r\nchallenged the right of Great Britain to the valley of the Columbia\r\nRiver or to any part of the Pacific Coast. And so recently as April of\r\nthis critical year 1823, Adams had taken alarm at the appearance of a\r\nBritish naval force off the coast of Cuba and had warned the Government\r\nat Madrid that \"the transfer of Cuba to Great Britain would be an event\r\nunpropitious to the interests of the United States.\" At the same time\r\nAdams stated his conviction that within half a century the annexation of\r\nCuba to the United States would be \"indispensable to the continuance of\r\nthe Union itself.\" Coupled with this prophecy was the equally frank\r\nassurance that the United States desired to have Cuba and Porto Rico\r\n\"continue attached to Spain\"--for the present.\r\n\r\n[Map: Russian Claims in North America]\r\n\r\nIt was in midsummer of this year, too, that Adams protested against the\r\nukase of the czar which had asserted the claim of Russia to the Pacific\r\nCoast as far south as the fifty-first degree, and to a maritime\r\njurisdiction one hundred Italian miles from the coast. Adams records in\r\nhis diary that he told the Russian minister \"that we should contest the\r\nright of Russia to _any_ territorial establishment on this continent,\r\nand that we should assume distinctly the principle that the American\r\ncontinents are no longer subjects for _any_ new European colonial\r\nestablishments.\" The time had come when the United States was bound to\r\ntake more than a sentimental interest in the affairs of Spanish America.\r\nThe disintegration of the Spanish colonial empire not only invited the\r\nIntervention of European powers in the internal affairs of the new\r\nrepublics, but also exposed portions of the North American continent to\r\ntheir aggressions.\r\n\r\nOn several occasions Canning conferred with Richard Rush, the minister\r\nof the United States resident in London, to ascertain whether his\r\nGovernment would join Great Britain in a public declaration against any\r\n\"forcible enterprise for reducing the colonies to subjugation on behalf\r\nof or in the name of Spain; or which meditates the acquisition of any\r\npart of them to itself, by cession or by conquest.\" England had no\r\ndesigns upon the distant colonies of Spain, Canning asseverated; at the\r\nsame time it \"could not see any part of them transferred to any other\r\npower with indifference.\" Not trusting implicitly in Canning's altruism,\r\nRush wisely suggested that Great Britain should first recognize the\r\nSouth American republics as a preliminary to a joint declaration. To\r\nthis Canning would not commit himself; and Rush would not assume\r\nresponsibility for a public declaration on any other conditions.\r\n\r\nOn receiving the dispatches from Rush recounting these interesting\r\nconferences, President Monroe took counsel with the two Virginia\r\noracles, Jefferson and Madison. Both advised him to meet Canning's\r\novertures and to make common cause with Great Britain--the one nation,\r\nas Jefferson put it, which could prevent America from having an\r\nindependent system and which now offered \"to lead, aid, and accompany us\r\nin it.\" Monroe was disposed to follow this advice. He not only drafted a\r\nmessage to Congress upon these lines, but he went further and urged the\r\nrecognition of Greek independence in a way which departed widely from\r\nthe traditional aloofness which earlier Presidents had maintained in\r\nmatters of European concern. On the other hand, Adams was decidedly of\r\nthe opinion that Canning's invitation should be declined. He did not\r\nwish the country to appear \"as a cock-boat in the wake of the British\r\nman-of-war.\" Moreover, Adams was considerably alarmed at the reactionary\r\nprinciples which the Russian ministry had avowed in a communication\r\naddressed to the minister at Washington. He urged the President to seize\r\nthe occasion to make an explicit declaration of American principles.\r\n\"The ground I wish to take,\" said he, \"is that of earnest remonstrance\r\nagainst the interference of European powers by force with South America,\r\nbut to disclaim all interference on our part with Europe; to make an\r\nAmerican cause and adhere inflexibly to that.\"\r\n\r\nYielding to his contentious Secretary of State, President Monroe\r\nredrafted his message to Congress. In its final form, December 2, 1823,\r\nthis famous state paper contained the essential principles of what has\r\ncome to be known as the Monroe Doctrine. It was asserted \"as a general\r\nprinciple in which the rights and interests of the United States are\r\ninvolved that the American continents, by the free and independent\r\ncondition which they have assumed and maintain, are henceforth not to be\r\nconsidered as subjects for future colonization by any European powers.\"\r\nThe message expressly disclaimed any purpose to interfere in European\r\npolitics; but respecting the affairs of the Western hemisphere a direct\r\nand immediate interest was frankly avowed. \"The political system of the\r\nallied powers is essentially different in this respect from that of\r\nAmerica.\" \"We should consider any attempt on their part to extend their\r\nsystem to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and\r\nsafety. With the existing colonies or dependencies of any European power\r\nwe have not interfered and shall not interfere. But with the Governments\r\nwho have declared their independence and maintained it, and whose\r\nindependence we have, on great consideration and on just principles,\r\nacknowledged, we could not view any interposition for the purpose of\r\noppressing them, or controlling in any manner their destiny, by any\r\nEuropean power in any other light than as the manifestation of an\r\nunfriendly disposition toward the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe immediate effects of the message are not easily traced. It is not\r\nclear, even, that the favorable treaty made with Russia in the following\r\nyear was the outcome of what Canning somewhat contemptuously styled \"the\r\nnew Doctrine of the President.\" Russia, it is true, agreed to waive her\r\nclaims below fifty-four degrees forty minutes and to exclusive\r\njurisdiction in Bering Sea; but the conflicting claims of England in the\r\nNorthwest remained, and Canning predicted that England would \"have a\r\nsquabble with the Yankees yet in and about those regions.\"\r\n\r\nLater generations have read strange meanings into the message of\r\nPresident Monroe. Even contemporaries were not clear as to its import.\r\nInterpreted in the light of its origin, it was a candid announcement\r\nthat the United States did not purpose to meddle in the affairs of\r\nEuropean states or of their existing dependencies, and a protest against\r\nthe increase of power of European states in America either by\r\nintervention or by new colonization.\r\n\r\n\r\n     BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\r\n\r\n     In the concluding volume of Henry Adams's _History of the United\r\n     States_ are excellent chapters on American literature, art, and\r\n     religious thought. W. B. Cairns's _On the Development of American\r\n     Literature from 1815 to 1833_ (1898) contains much interesting\r\n     information about periodicals. Barrett Wendell's _A Literary\r\n     History of America_ (1900) is full of pungent comment on early men\r\n     of letters. C. C. Caffin, _The Story of American Painting_ (1907),\r\n     and H. T. Tuckerman, _Artist-Life, or Sketches of American\r\n     Artists_ (1847), record the small achievements of American art.\r\n     John Trumbull's _Autobiography, Reminiscences, and Letters, from\r\n     1756 to 1841_ (1841), is a book of great interest. E. G. Dexter's\r\n     _A History of Education in the United States_ (1904) is an\r\n     excellent manual. The Unitarian Movement can be best followed in\r\n     J. W. Chadwick's _William Ellery Channing_ (1903). The history of\r\n     the various denominations may be found in volumes of the _American\r\n     Church History Series_. The genesis of Monroe's message is\r\n     described by F. J. Turner, _The Rise of the New West_(in _The\r\n     American Nation_, vol. 14, 1906), and F. E. Chadwick, _The\r\n     Relations of the United States and Spain_ (1909). Both of these\r\n     accounts are based on W. C. Ford, _John Quincy Adams: His\r\n     Connection with the Monroe Doctrine_ (in Massachusetts Historical\r\n     Society _Proceedings_, 1902). An excellent essay is that by W. F.\r\n     Reddaway, _The Monroe Doctrine_ (2d. ed., 1905).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE NEW DEMOCRACY\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the year 1824, the West had become a section to be reckoned with by\r\nthose who were calculating their chances in the presidential race. Since\r\nthe war six Western States had been admitted into the Union. The\r\npopulation west of the Alleghanies had increased by nearly a million and\r\na half within a decade. The relative importance of this new section\r\nappears in the census returns. In 1790, less than six per cent of the\r\ntotal population lived west of the Alleghanies; in 1820, nearly\r\nthirty-two per cent were domiciled in this vast region. In the National\r\nLegislature the West had acquired notable weight. By the apportionment\r\nof 1822, it had forty-seven out of two hundred and thirteen members of\r\nthe House; in the Senate, eighteen out of forty-eight. But these figures\r\ndo not tell the whole tale. As Professor Turner has well said, rightly\r\nto estimate the weight of Western population we must add the people of\r\nwestern New York and of the interior counties of Pennsylvania, and of\r\nthe trans-Alleghany counties of Virginia, as well as the people of the\r\nback-country of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, North Carolina, and\r\nGeorgia. \"All of these regions were to be influenced by the ideals of\r\ndemocratic rule which were springing up in the Mississippi Valley.\"\r\n\r\n[Map: Distribution of Population 1820]\r\n\r\nEconomic conditions bred a democratic society in the West. What\r\nGallatin said of Pennsylvania was true of the greater West: \"An equal\r\ndistribution of property made every individual independent and produced\r\na true and real equality.\" The basal characteristic of the West was\r\nindividual ownership of land; and the reaction of the sense of\r\nproprietorship upon individual character was the most significant fact\r\nin the history of its population. Intense individualism and rugged\r\nself-reliance were the salient characteristics of the Westerner. So far\r\nas he reflected upon his social relations, he believed in complete\r\nsocial equality. In numberless instances the pioneer had migrated to\r\nescape the social inequalities and depressing conventions of older\r\ncommunities; and he was not minded to encourage the reproduction of\r\nthese conditions in his new home. \"America, then, exhibits in her social\r\nstate an extraordinary phenomenon,\" wrote De Tocqueville in his notable\r\nstudy of American democracy. \"Men are there seen on a greater equality\r\nin point of fortune and intellect, or, in other words, more equal in\r\ntheir strength, than in any other country of the world, or in any age of\r\nwhich history has preserved the remembrance.\"\r\n\r\nLife on the frontier, where a man wrestled with the primitive forces of\r\nNature and conquered by dint of his indomitable will, made the Westerner\r\nperhaps overconfident in his ability to deal with all obstacles in the\r\nway of human achievement and withal somewhat impatient under the\r\nrestraints imposed by the more complicated social order in the older\r\ncommunities to the East. The sweep of the prairies and the wide horizon\r\nlines of the Middle West may have exercised a subtle influence upon\r\ntemperament. At all events, the Westerner was buoyant and optimistic,\r\ntaking large views of national destiny and of the possibilities of human\r\nachievement in a democracy.\r\n\r\nThere was danger, indeed, that in cutting loose from the irritating\r\nrestraints of the older communities, the people of the West would\r\nsacrifice much of the grace and many of the intellectual and spiritual\r\nrefinements of an older civilization. \"In this part of the American\r\ncontinent,\" observes De Tocqueville, \"population has escaped the\r\ninfluence not only of great names and great wealth, but even of the\r\nnatural aristocracy of knowledge and virtue.\" It seemed to two young New\r\nEnglanders who traversed the vast region from the Western Reserve to New\r\nOrleans in 1813, in the interests of missionary societies, that the\r\npeople were wrapped in spiritual darkness, \"being ignorant, often\r\nvicious, and utterly destitute of Bibles and religious literature.\" The\r\nGeneral Bible Society of the United States was founded in 1816 to dispel\r\nthis irreligious gloom. Within five years this organization and its\r\nnumerous auxiliaries had distributed one hundred and forty thousand\r\nBibles and Testaments through the new States.\r\n\r\nYet the irreligion of the West was painted darker than it really was.\r\nMethodism had struck root where other denominations could not thrive.\r\nIts methods and organization, indeed, were peculiarly adapted to a\r\npeople which could not support a settled pastor. \"A sect, therefore,\r\nwhich marked out the region into circuits, put a rider on each and bade\r\nhim cover it once a month, preaching here to-day and there to-morrow,\r\nbut returning at regular intervals to each community, provided the\r\nlargest amount of religious teaching and preaching at the least\r\nexpense.\" The Baptists, too, secured a footing in the new communities\r\nand labored effectively in creating religious ties between the old and\r\nthe new sections of the country. In religion as in politics the people\r\nof the West were responsive to emotional appeals. The circuit rider,\r\nwith his intense conviction of sin and his equally strong conviction of\r\nsalvation through repentance, wrought great crowds in camp meetings into\r\necstasies of religious excitement. Odd religious sects and strange\r\n\"isms\" were to be found in the back-country. At New Harmony on the\r\nWabash River were the Rappites, a sect of German peasants who came first\r\nto Pennsylvania under their leader George Rapp, and who afterward\r\nreturned thither. At Zoar in Ohio was the Separatist community led by\r\nJoseph Baumeler. Shaker societies were formed at many places; and\r\nMormonism was just beginning its strange history through the revelations\r\nof Joseph Smith in western New York.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual horizon of the Western world was necessarily limited.\r\nAbsorbed in the stern struggle for existence, the people had no leisure\r\nand no heart to enjoy the finer aspects of life. Education was a luxury\r\nwhich only the prosperous might possess. The purpose to make elementary\r\neducation a public charge developed tardily. Outside of New England,\r\nindeed, a public school system did not exist. Throughout the older\r\nportions of the West the traveler might find academies and so-called\r\ncolleges, but none supported at public expense. The State of Indiana,\r\nit is true, entered the Union with a constitution which made it the duty\r\nof the legislature to provide, as soon as circumstances permitted, \"for\r\na general system of education, ascending in a regular gradation from\r\ntownship schools to a State University, wherein tuition shall be gratis,\r\nand equally open to all.\" But years passed before circumstances\r\npermitted the realization of this ideal. Meantime, the prosperous\r\nplanters of the Southwest employed tutors for their children, and the\r\nwell-to-do farmers of the Northwest paid tuition for their boys at\r\nacademies. But young Abraham Lincoln had to teach himself Euclid and to\r\ncipher on the back of a wooden shovel, by the flickering embers of a\r\nlog-cabin fire.\r\n\r\nThe new Commonwealths entered the Union as self-confessed democracies.\r\nIn all the States formed after the War of 1812, with one exception,\r\nproperty qualifications such as prevailed in the older States were swept\r\naway and the right to vote was accorded to every adult white male. In\r\nMississippi alone there was the additional qualification that a voter\r\nshould be enrolled in the militia or have paid a state or county tax.\r\nEverywhere, too, the principle was accepted that representation should\r\nbe based upon population and not upon property. The men who framed these\r\nnew constitutions believed that they were establishing the rule of the\r\npeople. It was, indeed, unthinkable that, believing themselves equal in\r\nall other respects, they should not accept the principle of political\r\nequality and popular sovereignty.\r\n\r\nThere is evidence in these new constitutions, however, that the people\r\nplaced less reliance in their legislative bodies than did the people of\r\nthe Revolutionary era. Instead of general grants of legislative power,\r\nthere are specific prohibitions and positive injunctions. Important\r\nlimitations are imposed upon the form and mode of legislation. It is\r\nclear, too, that fear of an over-strong executive had given way to a\r\nbelief in the necessity of having a stronger countervailing influence,\r\ncapable of checking the legislative. Everywhere the governor was made\r\nelective directly by the people and given the veto power. The conviction\r\nwas often expressed in constitutional conventions that the governor was\r\npeculiarly the representative of the people, a popular tribune who would\r\nprotect them against the indiscretions of their legislative\r\nrepresentatives. The extension of the elective principle to all\r\nimportant offices was accompanied also by a general conviction that life\r\ntenure of office is undemocratic. \"Rotation in office,\" said Andrew\r\nJackson, voicing a popular feeling, \"is a cardinal principle of\r\ndemocracy.\"\r\n\r\nThe spirit of Western democracy leavened also the older States. The\r\npeople of Maine, breaking away from Massachusetts and her ancient\r\nideals, boldly declared for manhood suffrage in their new constitution.\r\nConnecticut adopted a constitution in 1818 to replace the old charter,\r\nand dissolved the old union of Church and State by declaring that no\r\npreference should be given by law to any Christian sect or mode of\r\nworship. At the same time Connecticut extended the suffrage to all who\r\nserved in the militia or paid a state tax. New York in the constitution\r\nof 1821 and Massachusetts by a constitutional amendment in the same\r\nyear abandoned the old property qualifications for voting.\r\n\r\nIn both Massachusetts and New York, conservative men like Chancellor\r\nKent and Daniel Webster frankly avowed their apprehensions of universal\r\nsuffrage. \"The tendency of universal suffrage,\" said Kent in the New\r\nYork convention, \"is to jeopardize the rights of property, and the\r\nprinciples of liberty.\" He held society to be an association for the\r\nprotection of property as well as of life, \"and the individual who\r\ncontributes only one cent to the common stock ought not to have the same\r\npower and influence in directing the property concerns of the\r\npartnership as he who contributes his thousands.\"\r\n\r\nThe democratic movement affected not only the formal organization of\r\nState Governments, but also the machinery and methods of political\r\nparties. In the Northern States there was increasing dissatisfaction\r\nwith the practice of nominating candidates for office by legislative\r\ncaucus. The rank and file of the parties were no longer willing to\r\nsubmit blindly to the dictation of leaders. In deference to party voters\r\nin districts which were not represented by men of their political faith,\r\nthe leaders of the respective parties now found it expedient to summon\r\nspecial delegates to their party conclaves, in order to give a more\r\ntruly representative character to the organization of party. The\r\nlegislative caucus, in short, gave way to the mixed caucus.\r\n\r\n[Map: States Admitted to the Union between 1812 and 1821]\r\n\r\nBut the old vice remained. The selection of candidates for office was\r\nstill made by those who had no mandate to act for the party except in\r\na legislative capacity. If the voters of the party were in truth the\r\nsource of authority within the party, then a means had to be devised of\r\nascertaining their will. The democratic principle, in short, had to be\r\napplied to party. In response to this feeling, mass meetings and\r\nirregular conventions were held; but these methods of securing an\r\nexpression of party opinion were only transitional. Indeed, so long as\r\nthe means of communication were defective, popular gatherings were\r\nnecessarily poorly attended. The next step in the democratization of\r\nparty organization could only be taken when the barriers of space were\r\novercome by the application of the steam engine to transportation. The\r\nnominating delegate convention waited on the development of\r\ntransportation.\r\n\r\nMuch the same popular hostility was directed against the congressional\r\ncaucus. Candidates for the presidential nomination were not blind to\r\nthis movement, and for the most part they sought other means of\r\npromoting their chances. Monroe had hardly entered upon his second term\r\nwhen state legislative caucuses began to nominate favorite sons. In\r\n1821, the legislature of South Carolina put forward the name of William\r\nLowndes, and upon his death named John C. Calhoun as its candidate for\r\nthe Presidency. In 1822, the legislature of Tennessee presented the name\r\nof Andrew Jackson, \"the soldier, the statesman, the honest man,\" to the\r\nconsideration of the people of the United States. In the same year\r\nRepublican members of the legislature of Kentucky recommended Henry Clay\r\n\"as a suitable person to succeed James Monroe as President.\" A \"joint\r\nmeeting of the Republican members of the Massachusetts legislature and\r\nof Republican delegates from the various towns of the Commonwealth not\r\nrepresented in the legislature\" nominated John Quincy Adams for the\r\nPresidency in January, 1823. And finally, illustrative of the varied\r\nmethods in use and of the strange vicissitudes of politics at this time,\r\na public gathering or mass meeting at Fredericksburg, Virginia, in\r\nMarch, 1824, nominated Adams for President and Jackson for\r\nVice-President.\r\n\r\nA series of resolutions passed by the legislature of Tennessee in 1823\r\ncalled attention in no uncertain language to the shortcomings of the\r\ncongressional caucus and called for its overthrow. A canvass of the\r\nmembers of Congress showed that one hundred and eighty-one out of two\r\nhundred and sixty-one believed a caucus inexpedient at this time.\r\nNevertheless, the minority, acting in Crawford's interest, took their\r\ncourage in both hands and held a caucus on February 14, 1824. Sixty-four\r\nout of sixty-eight votes were cast for William H. Crawford, who thus\r\nbecame by all precedents the \"regular\" candidate of the Republican\r\nparty. This nomination and the indorsement of Jackson by the Republicans\r\nof Pennsylvania spoiled Calhoun's chances. In the spring of 1824, he\r\nallied himself with the Jackson faction by accepting the nomination for\r\nVice-President at the hands of a state nominating convention at\r\nHarrisburg, which had put Jackson at the head of the ticket.\r\n\r\nSuch issues as were discoverable in the presidential contest of 1824\r\nwere formulated in the debates in Congress during the early part of the\r\nyear. As the country recovered from financial depression, the question\r\nof internal improvements again forged to the front. In 1822, a bill to\r\nauthorize the collection of tolls on the Cumberland Road had been vetoed\r\nby the President. In an elaborate essay Monroe set forth his views on\r\nthe constitutional aspects of a policy of internal improvements.\r\nCongress might appropriate money, he admitted, but it might not\r\nundertake the actual construction of national works nor assume\r\njurisdiction over them. For the moment the drift toward a larger\r\nparticipation of the National Government in internal improvements was\r\nstayed. Two years later, however, Congress authorized the President to\r\ninstitute surveys for such roads and canals as he believed to be needed\r\nfor commerce and military defense. The vote on this bill shows that the\r\nsource of opposition to internal improvements was chiefly in the\r\nNortheast, in Virginia, and in the Carolinas. The West and Southwest,\r\nwith Pennsylvania, Maryland, and New Jersey, were a unit in support of\r\nthe general survey.\r\n\r\nNo one pleaded more eloquently for a larger conception of the functions\r\nof the National Government than Clay. No one voiced the aspirations of\r\nhis section more faithfully. He called the attention of his hearers to\r\nprovisions made for coast surveys and lighthouses on the Atlantic\r\nseaboard and deplored the neglect of the great interior of the country.\r\n\"A new world has come into being since the Constitution was adopted,\" he\r\nexclaimed. \"Are the narrow, limited necessities of the old thirteen\r\nStates, of, indeed, parts only of the old thirteen States as they\r\nexisted at the formation of the present Constitution, forever to remain\r\nthe rule of its interpretation?\" Of the other presidential candidates,\r\nJackson voted in the Senate for the general survey bill; and Adams left\r\nno doubt in the public mind that he did not reflect the narrow views of\r\nhis section on this issue. Crawford felt the constitutional scruples\r\nwhich were everywhere being voiced in the South, and followed the old\r\nexpedient of advocating a constitutional amendment to sanction national\r\ninternal improvements.\r\n\r\nThe Tariff Act of 1824 also entered somewhat into the presidential\r\ncampaign. The failure of the protectionists to secure a higher tariff in\r\n1820 had been followed by other efforts to secure congressional action;\r\nbut none succeeded until Clay was again elected Speaker of the House and\r\nthrust the matter into the foreground of discussion. Clay dwelt\r\neloquently upon the loss of the foreign market for agricultural products\r\nand upon the consequent widespread distress. To his mind the remedy was\r\nthe establishment of an American market by fostering manufactures. That\r\nsuch a policy would involve a clash of sectional interests, he did not\r\ndeny; but he believed that \"reconciliation by mutual concessions\" could\r\nbe effected and a genuine \"American system\" be brought into existence.\r\n\r\n[Map: House Vote on Tariff Bill April 16, 1824]\r\n\r\nThe tariff bill presented in 1824 was avowedly a protective measure.\r\nAmong lesser changes, increased duties were proposed on iron, lead,\r\nwool, hemp, cotton bagging, and cotton and woolen goods. At once\r\nthe clash of sectional interests began. New England shippers protested\r\nagainst the duty on hemp, which they needed for cordage; and Southern\r\nplanters made common cause with them on this item, because the cheap\r\nbagging which they used for baling their cotton was made of coarse hemp.\r\nFor the same reason the maritime sections of New England opposed the\r\nduty on iron. For precisely opposite reasons, Kentucky clamored for the\r\nprotection of her hemp-growers, and Pennsylvania, for the protection of\r\nher iron-workers. It was well understood that the cotton industry was\r\nestablished and needed no protection; nevertheless, the minimum duty on\r\ncotton fabrics was raised. The increased duty on woolens, however, was\r\noffset by an increased duty on raw wool, so that the woolen\r\nmanufacturers profited little by the change of rate. A proposal to apply\r\nto woolens the minimum principle which had been extended to cottons in\r\n1816 was defeated by the opposition of the South. Any increase in the\r\ncost of cheap woolen goods was bound to enhance the cost of clothing the\r\nslaves. On the other hand, the representatives of the great\r\ngrain-growing and farming States of New York, New Jersey, and\r\nPennsylvania, together with the States of the Ohio Valley, were almost\r\nunanimously in favor of the proposed bill. When the bill came to a vote\r\nin the House on April 16, 1824, only nine of the combined ninety-five\r\nvotes of these sections were cast in the negative. Equally emphatic was\r\nthe protest of the South and Southwest: only six out of seventy-six\r\nRepresentatives favored the bill. New England by its divided vote\r\nrevealed the internal conflict between the commercial and manufacturing\r\ninterests. The bill passed both houses of Congress by small majorities\r\nand received the signature of the President.\r\n\r\nOf the presidential candidates, only one spoke with uncertain sound on\r\nthe tariff issue. Clay was the outspoken advocate of a far-reaching\r\nAmerican system; Adams thought the tariff of 1824 a fair compromise;\r\nJackson, properly coached by his intimates, put himself on record as a\r\nsupporter of a protective policy to create a home market; only Crawford,\r\nrepresentative of the peculiar interests of the South and candidate for\r\nNorthern support, felt the impossibility of harmonizing the conflicting\r\ninterests of his followers by a clear-cut and explicit utterance on the\r\ntariff.\r\n\r\nWith so many candidates in the field, it was difficult to forecast the\r\noutcome of the presidential campaign. Even if there had been a\r\npronounced popular drift toward any candidate, the result would have\r\nremained in doubt until the six States which still gave the choice of\r\nelectors to their legislatures had completed the complicated electoral\r\nprocess. There was a strong likelihood, however, that the election would\r\ngo to the House of Representatives. As the choice would then be confined\r\nto the three candidates having the highest vote, there was not a little\r\nbargaining in the States where the legislatures chose the electors. The\r\ncompleted returns gave Jackson 99 electoral votes; Adams, 84; Crawford,\r\n41; and Clay, 37. Calhoun was elected Vice-President by more than two\r\nthirds of the electoral vote. The House, therefore, as wiseacres had\r\nforetold, was called upon for the second time to decide a contested\r\npresidential election.\r\n\r\nThe position of Clay was one of unenviable distinction and power. He\r\ncould not be elected President, but he could, it was believed, determine\r\nwhich of his rivals should have the coveted office. His own State\r\nfavored Jackson as a second choice; but Clay wrote to a friend that he\r\ncould not consider the killing of twenty-five hundred Englishmen at New\r\nOrleans proved the fitness of Jackson for the chief civil magistracy.\r\nCrawford was personally less objectionable to Clay; but he had suffered\r\na paralytic stroke and his health was precarious. Besides, Crawford had\r\nopposed some of the policies which Clay had most at heart. For years\r\nClay had been a bitter opponent of Adams; yet after all was said, he was\r\nbound to admit that his interests would be best served by an alliance\r\nwith this stiff-necked New Englander. At an early date, therefore, he\r\ndetermined to throw his support to Adams.\r\n\r\nFor weeks the capital was enveloped in an atmosphere of intrigue. Clay\r\nwas courted by all factions. The possibility of securing his support was\r\na standing temptation to wire-pullers. Even Adams wrote in his diary,\r\n\"_Incedo super ignes_\" (I walk over fires). When Clay announced\r\npositively, on January 24, that he and his friends would support Adams,\r\na storm of passionate denunciation broke upon him. An anonymous letter\r\nappeared in a Philadelphia newspaper, charging that friends of Adams had\r\noffered Clay the Secretaryship of State in return for his support, and\r\nthat friends of Clay had reported the offer to friends of Jackson, with\r\nthe intimation that Clay would support the general on similar terms.\r\nWhen the friends of Jackson spurned these overtures, Clay sold out to\r\nAdams. With quite unnecessary heat Clay branded the author of this\r\nletter as \"a base and infamous calumniator, a dastard, and a liar.\" His\r\nfirst instinct was to challenge the author whoever he might be; but when\r\nRepresentative George Kremer, an odd character who was chiefly\r\nconspicuous by reason of the leopard-skin coat which he wore avowed\r\nhimself the writer of the offensive letter, Clay wisely concluded not to\r\nmake himself ridiculous by an affair of honor with this Gil Blas. He\r\ndemanded a congressional investigation instead.\r\n\r\nWhile this investigation of the alleged bargain between Adams and Clay\r\nwas pending, the House proceeded to the election of a President. On the\r\nfirst ballot, Adams received the votes of thirteen States, while Jackson\r\nwas the choice of seven States, and Crawford of four. New England, New\r\nYork, Louisiana, Maryland, and the States of the Northwest, except\r\nIndiana, supported Adams. Combined with these were now Missouri and\r\nKentucky, which had voted for Clay. Jackson received the votes of the\r\nSouthwest, together with those of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Indiana, and\r\nSouth Carolina. Crawford was supported by Georgia, North Carolina,\r\nVirginia, and Delaware. Two days later the President-elect announced\r\nthat he had invited Henry Clay to be his Secretary of State. After some\r\nhesitation, Clay accepted the post.\r\n\r\n[Map: The Presidential Election of 1824]\r\n\r\nThe cry of corruption is a recurrent note in the history of\r\ndemocracies. The American democracy is no exception. With most of the\r\ncharges of corruption, the historian has little concern; but the bargain\r\nand corruption cry of 1825 has a historical significance. The falsity of\r\nthe charge against Clay has been proved as nearly as a negative can be.\r\nAdams may not have been above the uncongenial task of soliciting votes,\r\nbut he kept safely within the moral domain which his conscience marked\r\nout. The motive which governed his appointment of Clay as Secretary of\r\nState is stated frankly in a letter to Monroe, two days after the\r\nelection by the House. He considered the appointment \"due to his talents\r\nand services to the western section of the Union, whence he comes, and\r\nto the confidence in me manifested by their delegations.\" Upon one\r\nindividual these considerations made no impression: Andrew Jackson left\r\nthe capital with wrath in his soul. He felt that he had been defrauded\r\nby a corrupt bargain. From this time on his hand was against Clay,--that\r\n\"Judas of the West,\" as he afterward called him,--who had conspired to\r\n\"impair the pure principles of our republican institutions\" and to\r\n\"prostrate that fundamental maxim which maintains the supremacy of the\r\npeople's will.\"\r\n\r\nYears after the events of 1824-25, the belief of Jackson that the will\r\nof the people had been defeated found classic expression in Thomas H.\r\nBenton's _Thirty Years' View of Congress_. What Benton termed \"the Demos\r\nKrateo principle\" was thoroughly in accord with the spirit of the new\r\ndemocracy, but it rested upon an entire misunderstanding of the\r\nConstitution. A direct popular election of the President was never\r\ncontemplated by the framers of the Constitution. It is impossible to\r\nfind in either the letter or the spirit of the Constitution any\r\njustification for the view that the House of Representatives is bound to\r\nelect the candidate having the highest popular vote.\r\n\r\nWhat the will of the people really was in the presidential election of\r\n1824 is by no means clear. Even in those States where presidential\r\nelectors were chosen by popular vote, Jackson received less than half of\r\nthe popular vote; and in many of these States the actual vote fell far\r\nbelow the potential. In Massachusetts, where 66,000 votes had been cast\r\nfor governor the year before, only 37,000 voters took the trouble to\r\nvote for President. In Pennsylvania, which boasted of a population of\r\nover a million, less than 48,000 voted in 1824. Moreover, the six States\r\nwhich chose the presidential electors through their legislatures,\r\ncontained one fourth of the population of the country. One fact,\r\nhowever, stands out with unmistakable clearness,--and it did not escape\r\npoliticians like Van Buren, of New York, who had their fingers on the\r\npulse of the people,--this martial hero from out of the West had an\r\nunprecedented vote-getting capacity. It were well to observe the Western\r\nhorizon more intently.\r\n\r\n\r\n     BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\r\n\r\n     The best description of the political characteristics of American\r\n     society in this period is given by Alexis de Tocqueville,\r\n     _Democracy in America_ (2 vols., trans., 1862). F. J. Turner has\r\n     pointed out the importance of the West in the development of the\r\n     nation in several studies, notably: \"The Significance of the\r\n     Frontier in American History\" (American Historical Association,\r\n     _Report_, 1893); \"The Problem of the West\" (_Atlantic Monthly_,\r\n     vol. 78); \"Contributions of the West to American Democracy\"\r\n     (_Atlantic Monthly_, vol. 91). The political development of the\r\n     South is set forth with great thoroughness by U. B. Phillips,\r\n     _Georgia and State Rights_ (American Historical Association,\r\n     _Report_, 1901); W. A. Schaper, _Sectionalism and Representation\r\n     in South Carolina_ (_ibid._, 1900); and C. H. Ambler,\r\n     _Sectionalism in Virginia from 1776 to 1861_ (1910). Important\r\n     aspects of the tariff are discussed in Edward Stanwood's _American\r\n     Tariff Controversies in the Nineteenth Century_ (2 vols., 1903),\r\n     and in C. W. Wright's _Wool-Growing and the Tariff_ (1910).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nPOLITICS AND STATE RIGHTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of his election made the position of President Adams\r\none of very great difficulty. He alluded to his embarrassment in his\r\nfirst message to Congress. \"Less possessed of your confidence in advance\r\nthan any of my predecessors,\" said he, \"I am deeply conscious of the\r\nprospect that I shall stand more and oftener in need of your\r\nindulgence.\" It is doubtful, however, if even he appreciated the\r\nmomentum of the forces which were already combining to discredit his\r\nadministration. In October, the legislature of Tennessee had again\r\nnominated Jackson for the Presidency, and he had accepted the nomination\r\nas a summons to wage war upon the forces of evil in high places. The\r\ncampaign of 1828, indeed, had already begun: and it was to be a campaign\r\nof personal vindication as well as of popular rights.\r\n\r\nUnder similar circumstances most men would have made sure of the loyalty\r\nof their constitutional advisers, at least, but Adams flattered himself\r\nthat he could carry on a non-partisan administration. The results were\r\ndisastrous, for at least two of the Cabinet were not above using the\r\npatronage of office to further the cause of Jackson. In his laudable\r\ndesire not to allow the Government to become \"a perpetual and\r\nunintermitting scramble for office,\" Adams refused to make removals in\r\nthe civil service on partisan grounds, yet he retained in office\r\nunderlings who labored incessantly in the cause of the opposition.\r\n\r\nEqually impolitic was the attitude of the President toward questions of\r\npublic policy in his first message to Congress. Just when the opposition\r\nwas in a fluid state and the winds of conflicting doctrines were\r\nruffling the surface of national politics, Adams gave utterance to\r\nopinions on the functions of government which were bound to alienate\r\nmany of his followers. Entertaining no doubts as to constitutional\r\nlimitations upon the powers of the National Government, he advocated not\r\nonly the construction of roads and canals, but the establishment of\r\nobservatories and a national university. His program included\r\ngovernmental aid to the arts, mechanical and literary, and to the\r\nsciences, \"ornamental and profound.\" He was prepared to give\r\nencouragement not only to manufacturing but to agriculture and to\r\ncommerce. Many of these were objects which President Jefferson had\r\nrecommended to the consideration of Congress in 1806; but whereas he had\r\nurged the adoption of amendments to the Constitution which would\r\nauthorize Congress to provide for roads and canals and education, Adams\r\nseemed oblivious to the limitations of the Constitution. In much alarm\r\nJefferson suggested to Madison the desirability of having Virginia adopt\r\na new set of resolutions, bottomed on those of 1798, and directed\r\nagainst the acts for internal improvements. In March, 1826, the general\r\nassembly declared that all the principles of the earlier resolutions\r\napplied \"with full force against the powers assumed by Congress\" in\r\npassing acts to protect manufactures and to further internal\r\nimprovements. That the Administration would meet with opposition in\r\nCongress, whatever its program might be, was a foregone conclusion. The\r\nonly question was whether the diverse and mutually hostile factions\r\nwhich had followed the fortunes of Crawford, Calhoun, and Jackson could\r\ncoalesce into a consistent opposition. The first test occurred when the\r\nAdministration proposed the Panama mission.\r\n\r\nThe overthrow of the authority of Spain in South America had left the\r\nway clear for the long-projected union of the republics. Early in the\r\nyear 1825, the ministers of Mexico, Guatemala, and Colombia waited on\r\nClay to learn whether the United States would accept an invitation to a\r\ngreat council or congress which had been called by the revolutionist\r\nBolivar, now President of Colombia. The project appealed strongly to\r\nClay. A league of young republics in the New World to offset the Holy\r\nAlliance in Europe was, as his biographer remarks, \"one of those large,\r\ngenerous conceptions well calculated to fascinate his ardent mind.\" The\r\nimagination of the President was not so easily touched: he instructed\r\nClay to inquire more particularly into the purposes of the congress.\r\n\r\nThe condition of affairs in the countries bordering on the Caribbean\r\nSea--the American Mediterranean--was such, indeed, as to justify extreme\r\ncaution in dealing with the Latin-American republics. It was matter of\r\ncommon knowledge that Colombia and Mexico had designs upon Cuba, the\r\nlast of the Spanish outposts in the New World. So long as Spain\r\ncontinued at war with her old colonies, the United States was bound to\r\nbe uneasy about the fate of Cuba and Porto Rico. Even if the islands\r\nwere liberated by the republican armies of Central and South America,\r\nthey were likely to fall a prey to some European power. The appearance\r\nof a French fleet off the coast of Cuba during the summer of 1825 gave\r\npoint to these not unwarranted apprehensions. It was rumored that Cuba\r\nwas to be made the basis for an expedition against Mexico in behalf of\r\nSpain. This episode prompted Clay to make strong representations to\r\nFrance that the United States could not consent to the occupation of\r\nCuba by any other European power.\r\n\r\nWhen, then, a formal invitation came to participate in the Panama\r\nCongress, the Administration determined to seize the occasion to\r\nexercise a wholesome restraint by friendly advice upon the assembled\r\ndelegates of the republics, and at the same time to ascertain their\r\npurposes. In asking the Senate to confirm the nomination of two\r\ndelegates, however, the President voiced his own expectation of what the\r\nCongress would be and do, rather than the purposes of Bolivar and his\r\nassociates. The occasion would be favorable, the President intimated,\r\nfor the discussion of commercial reciprocity, of neutral rights, and of\r\nprinciples of religious liberty. An alliance with the Latin-American\r\nrepublics was not contemplated. On the contrary, the delegates from the\r\nUnited States would urge \"an agreement between all of the parties\r\nrepresented at the meeting, that each will guard by its own means\r\nagainst the establishment of any future European colony within its\r\nborders.\" At this stage in its evolution the Monroe Doctrine was not\r\nunderstood to include any obligation on the part of the United States to\r\npolice the territories of the lesser republics of the New World.\r\n\r\nThe instructions given to the envoys leave no doubt as to the intentions\r\nof the Administration. Every possible endeavor was to be made to\r\ndissuade Colombia and Mexico from their designs upon Cuba and Porto\r\nRico. The recognition of Hayti as an independent state was to be\r\ndeprecated. In short, the _status quo_ in the Caribbean Sea was to be\r\nmaintained; and throughout, the congress was to be regarded as a\r\ndiplomatic conference and in no wise as a convention to constitute a\r\npermanent league of republics.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the opposition in Congress persisted in misrepresenting\r\nthe President's purposes. It was pointed out that the republics to the\r\nsouth very generally believed that the United States was pledged by\r\nMonroe's message to make common cause with them when their independence\r\nwas threatened. \"Are we prepared,\" asked Hayne, of South Carolina, \"to\r\nsend ministers to the Congress of Panama for the purpose of making\r\neffectual this pledge of President Monroe as construed by the present\r\nadministration and understood by the Spanish-American states?\" With\r\ngreater sincerity Southern Representatives protested against\r\nparticipating in a congress which proposed to discuss the suppression\r\nof the slave trade and the future of Hayti. \"Slavery in all its\r\nbearings,\" said Hayne, \"is a question of extreme delicacy, concerning\r\nwhich there is but one safe rule either for the States in which it\r\nexists or for the Union. It must ever be treated as a domestic question.\r\nTo foreign governments the language of the United States must be that\r\nthe question of slavery concerns the peace and safety of our political\r\nfamily, and that we cannot allow it to be discussed.\" Least of all, he\r\ncontinued, could the United States touch the question of the\r\nindependence of Hayti in connection with revolutionary governments which\r\nhad marched to victory under the banner of universal emancipation and\r\nwhich had permitted men of color to command their armies and enter their\r\nlegislative halls.\r\n\r\nIn the end the Administration had its way and the nominations were\r\nconfirmed; but the delay was most unfortunate. On their way to the\r\nIsthmus, one of the delegates died, and the other arrived too late to\r\ntake part in the congress. From the viewpoint of domestic politics, the\r\ncontroversy over the mission was only an incident in the evolution of a\r\nparty within the bosom of the Democratic party. The animus of the\r\nopposition is revealed in the often-quoted remark of Martin Van Buren,\r\nwho was trying to drill the varied elements in the Senate into a\r\ncoherent organization: \"Yes, they have beaten us by a few votes, after a\r\nhard battle; but if they had only taken the other side and refused the\r\nmission, we should have had them.\"\r\n\r\nOf far more serious import than this factional opposition in Congress\r\nwas the resistance which the authorities of Georgia offered to the\r\nNational Administration in the matter of Indian lands. On March 5, 1825,\r\nthe Senate ratified the Treaty of Indian Springs with the Creek Indians,\r\nwhich provided for the cession of practically all the lands of the tribe\r\nbetween the Flint and Chattahoochee Rivers. For years the planters of\r\nGeorgia had coveted these fertile tracts, awaiting with impatience the\r\nnegotiations of the Federal Government with the reluctant Indians.\r\nAlthough the title to the lands was not to pass to Georgia until\r\nSeptember 1, 1826, Governor Troup ordered them to be surveyed with a\r\nview to their immediate occupation. Meantime, well-founded charges were\r\ncurrent that the treaty had been made by a faction among the Creeks,\r\nwithout the consent of the responsible chiefs. President Adams at once\r\nordered the state authorities to desist from their survey; but the\r\ngovernor replied that Georgia was convinced of the validity of the\r\ntreaty and fully determined to enter into possession of her own. The\r\ntone of the governor's letter was ominous. Nevertheless, the President\r\ninstituted negotiations for a new treaty. The diplomatic shifts resorted\r\nto by the Indian agents in this instance were not above suspicion, but\r\nthe President seemed to entertain no misgivings, for he assured the\r\nSenate that the new Treaty of Washington (January 24, 1826) was the will\r\nand deed of \"the chiefs of the whole Creek Nation.\" The grant left the\r\nIndians still in possession of some lands west of the Chattahoochee.\r\n\r\nThe feelings of all loyal Georgians were outraged by the course of the\r\nAdministration. The legislature protested against the Treaty of\r\nWashington as \"illegal and unconstitutional,\" and denounced the\r\nPresident's action as \"an instance of dictation and federal supremacy\r\nunwarranted by any grant of powers to the General Government.\" \"Georgia\r\nowns exclusively the soil and jurisdiction of all the territory within\r\nher present chartered and conventional limits,\" read the resolutions of\r\nDecember 22, 1826. \"She has never relinquished said right, either\r\nterritorial or jurisdictional, to the General Government.\"\r\n\r\nThe ebullient governor hardly needed the indorsement of the legislature.\r\nHe pushed on the surveys to the limits set by the original treaty. But\r\nthe surveyors soon met with resistance from the Indians; and the Indians\r\nappealed to the President. The Secretary of War then notified Troup that\r\nthe President felt himself compelled to employ all the means under his\r\ncontrol to maintain the faith of the nation and to carry the treaty into\r\neffect. Governor Troup replied defiantly that the \"military character of\r\nthe menace\" was well understood. \"You will distinctly understand,\r\ntherefore, that I feel it my duty to resist to the utmost any military\r\nattack.... From the first decisive act of hostility, you will be\r\nconsidered and treated as a public enemy, and with less repugnance\r\nbecause you, to whom we might constitutionally have appealed for our\r\ndefense against invasion, are yourselves the invaders, and, what is\r\nmore, the unblushing allies of the savages whose course you have\r\nadopted.\" He at once issued orders to the state military officers to\r\nhold the militia in readiness to repel any invasion of the soil of\r\nGeorgia.\r\n\r\nThe tension which had now become acute was relieved by the intelligence\r\nthat the President had ordered the Indian agent to the Creeks to resume\r\nnegotiations for the cession of the rest of their lands. The governor\r\nhastened to point out jubilantly that the President had beaten a\r\nretreat. Meantime, the President had laid the whole matter before\r\nCongress in a special message. A committee of the House advised the\r\npurchase of the rest of the Indian lands, but in the mean time the\r\nmaintenance of the terms of the Treaty of Washington. A committee of the\r\nSenate, however, with Benton as chairman, took an opposite view of the\r\nsituation, and deprecated any action looking toward the coercion of a\r\nsister State. A treaty concluded with the Creeks in November, 1827,\r\nfortunately satisfied all parties and put an end to this exciting\r\ncontroversy--a controversy in which the President had played a lone and\r\nnot very successful hand.\r\n\r\nIn this same year (1827), another Indian problem of even greater\r\nperplexity arose. The Cherokees of northwestern Georgia, who were ruled\r\nby a group of intelligent half-breeds, declared themselves one of the\r\nsovereign and independent nations of the earth, and drafted a\r\nconstitution which completely excluded the authority of the State of\r\nGeorgia. Again, in no uncertain language, Georgia asserted her title to\r\nall the lands within her limits, regarding the Indians simply as\r\n\"tenants at her will\"; but before the controversy reached an acute\r\nstage Adams had surrendered the Presidency to General Andrew Jackson,\r\nwho had only contempt for Indian rights when they fell athwart the\r\npurposes of honest white settlers.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these protestations against federal intervention, the\r\nlegislature of Georgia sounded a note of defiance also in the matter of\r\nthe tariff. It was \"their decided opinion an increase of Tariff duties\r\nwill and ought to be RESISTED by all legal and constitutional means.\"\r\nJust what should be \"the mode of opposition\" they would not pretend to\r\nsay, but for the present they would content themselves with \"the\r\npeaceable course of remonstrating with Congress.\" This rather ominous\r\nprotest was inspired by the demands of certain manufacturers and\r\npoliticians who had assembled in convention at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,\r\nin the summer of 1827.\r\n\r\nThe woolen industry had profited least of all those which had been\r\nprotected by the Tariff of 1824. Not only had the slight advance in\r\nrates been offset by the increase of the duty on raw wool, but the\r\neffect of English competition in 1825 had been most depressing to the\r\nwoolen trade. A tariff bill to meet the wishes of the wool-growers and\r\nwoolen manufacturers had passed the House early in 1827, but had been\r\ndefeated in the Senate by the casting vote of the Vice-President. The\r\nconvention at Harrisburg was designed to create a public sentiment in\r\nfavor of the protected interests and to bring pressure from various\r\nsources to bear upon Congress. The failure of the tariff bill in the\r\nspring session had impressed upon woolen manufacturers the necessity of\r\nsecuring allies.\r\n\r\nThe recommendations of the convention at Harrisburg were comprehensive.\r\nHigher duties all along the line, from wool to glass, were urged. But\r\nthat which the promoters of the convention had most at heart was the\r\nextension to woolens of the minimum principle already applied to cotton\r\nfabrics. According to their demands, the _ad valorem_ duty on woolens\r\nshould range from forty to fifty per cent, assessed on minimum\r\nvaluations of fifty cents, two dollars and a half, four dollars, and six\r\ndollars a yard. That is to say, goods valued at less than fifty cents a\r\nyard were to be treated as though they had a value of fifty cents; and\r\nall between fifty cents and two dollars and a half, as though they were\r\nworth two dollars and a half; and so on--a system which offered a high\r\ndegree of protection to the cheaper fabrics in each group.\r\n\r\n[Map: House Vote on Tariff Bill April 22, 1828]\r\n\r\nThe high hopes of the protectionists were only partially realized. In\r\nthe following session of Congress, economic interests became badly\r\ntangled with political. The President and the greater part of his\r\nsupporters were protectionists. Indeed, it was openly charged by the\r\nopposition that the Harrisburg Convention was a device of the Adams men\r\nto promote his reelection. The opposition, on the other hand, was far\r\nfrom united on the tariff question. The only affinity between Southern\r\nplanters and their Northern allies in the Middle and Western States was\r\nhostility to the Administration. According to Calhoun, who in after\r\nyears made a frank avowal of his part in the intrigue, the opposition\r\ndetermined to frame a tariff bill with a general high level of\r\nduties to satisfy the Middle and Western States, but to increase\r\nthe duties on raw material which New England manufacturers needed. All\r\nthe stanch Jackson men were to unite in forcing this bill to a passage\r\nwithout amendment. At the last moment, however, the Southern group were\r\nto part company with their allies and to vote against the bill. The\r\nRepresentatives from New England, and the supporters of the\r\nAdministration generally, would of course vote against the bill also,\r\nand so compass its defeat. The odium would then fall upon the Adams men,\r\nwhile the Jackson men could pose as the only whole-hearted advocates of\r\nprotection; and, finally, not the least factor in Calhoun's\r\ncalculations, the South would escape the toils of high protection. There\r\nwas only one hitch in this cleverly planned game. To the consternation\r\nof the plotters, enough New England Representatives swallowed the bitter\r\ndose to enact the bill.\r\n\r\nThe \"tariff of abominations\" deserves all the abuse which has been\r\nheaped upon it. Shapen in political iniquity, it bore upon its face the\r\nmarks of its origin. High duties for which no one had asked were imposed\r\non certain raw material like pig and bar iron, and hemp, the better\r\nquality of which was always in demand and never produced in the United\r\nStates. Items like the increased duty on molasses and the heavy duty on\r\nsail-duck were added to make the bill distasteful to New England. But\r\nthe woolen industry suffered the most grievous disappointment. Instead\r\nof the minimum principle advocated by the Harrisburg Convention, the Act\r\nof 1828 established a minimum of one dollar between the minimal points\r\nof fifty cents and two dollars and a half. Whereas the proposed rate\r\nwould have fixed a prohibitory duty on woolens costing about a dollar a\r\nyard, the act allowed only a duty of forty-five per cent. \"The dollar\r\nminimum,\" as one of the aggrieved manufacturers put it, \"was planted in\r\nthe very midst of the woolen trade.\"\r\n\r\nAgain the Middle States and the States of the Ohio Valley united in\r\nsupport of the protective principle. New England was divided against\r\nitself. Political considerations weighed heavily with those New\r\nEnglanders who like Webster voted for the bill. John Randolph hardly\r\nexaggerated when he declared that \"the bill referred to manufactures of\r\nno sort or kind, except the manufacture of a President of the United\r\nStates.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\r\n\r\n     To the bibliography at the close of the preceding chapter only a few\r\n     titles need be added. The foreign policy of the Adams Administration\r\n     is well described in F. E. Chadwick's _The Relations of the United\r\n     States and Spain_ (1909). The stages in the Indian controversy may\r\n     be traced in U. B. Phillips's _Georgia and State Rights_ (American\r\n     Historical Association, _Report_, 1901), and in E. J. Hardin's _Life\r\n     of George M. Troup_ (1859). E. M. Shepard, _Martin Van Buren_\r\n     (1888), and T. D. Jervey, _Robert Y. Hayne and His Times_ (1909),\r\n     are important biographies. Josiah Quincy's _Figures of the Past_\r\n     (1883) contains some interesting sketches of Washington society,\r\n     while N. Sargent's _Public Men and Events_ (2 vols., 1875) supplies\r\n     an abundance of political gossip.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE RISE OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY\r\n\r\n\r\nShortly after the Federal Convention of 1787, a friend remarked to\r\nGouverneur Morris, \"You have made a good constitution.\" \"That,\" replied\r\nMorris laconically, \"depends on how it is construed!\" From Washington to\r\nJackson the process of construing the Constitution had gone on,\r\nintermittently by the executive and legislative, steadily by the\r\njudiciary. \"The judiciary of the United States,\" wrote Jefferson in\r\n1820, \"is the subtle corps of sappers and miners constantly working\r\nunderground to undermine the foundations of our confederate fabric. They\r\nare constantly construing our constitution from a coordination of a\r\ngeneral and a special government, to a general and supreme one alone.\r\nThey will lay all things at their feet, and they are too well versed in\r\nthe English law to forget the maxim, '_boni judicis est ampliare\r\njurisdictionem_.'\"\r\n\r\nYet as late as 1800 the federal judiciary had pronounced none of those\r\ndecisions which were to make it so powerful a factor in the assertion\r\nand maintenance of national sovereignty. In declining an appointment as\r\nChief Justice, John Jay wrote to President Adams that he had \"left the\r\nbench perfectly convinced that under a system so defective, it would not\r\nobtain the energy, weight, and dignity, which were essential to its\r\naffording due support to the National Government; nor acquire the\r\npublic confidence and respect which, as the last resort of the justice\r\nof the Nation, it should possess.\"\r\n\r\nThe uncertainty of the law was in large part responsible for this lack\r\nof prestige. \"Too great inattention,\" complained a Boston lawyer, in the\r\n_Columbian Centinel_ in 1801, \"has hitherto prevailed as to the\r\npreservation of the decisions of our courts of law. We have neither\r\nauthorized nor voluntary reporters. Hence we are compelled to the loose\r\nand interested recollections of counsel, or to depend wholly on British\r\ndecisions.\" The first systematic attempt to secure records of opinions\r\nwas made by Connecticut in 1785. Four years later, Ephraim Kirby, a\r\nprinter in Litchfield, issued \"the first regular printed law reports in\r\nAmerica.\" This example was followed in other States; and in 1798 the\r\nfirst volume of United States Supreme Court Reports was published by\r\nDallas.\r\n\r\nThe great period in the history of the Supreme Court coincides with the\r\nthirty-four years during which John Marshall held the office of Chief\r\nJustice. President John Adams rendered no more lasting service to the\r\nFederalist cause than when he appointed this great Virginian to the\r\nbench, for Marshall, if not a Federalist of the strictest sect, was a\r\nthoroughgoing nationalist. Down to his appointment only six decisions\r\ninvolving constitutional questions of any moment had been handed down;\r\nbetween 1801 and 1835, sixty-two were rendered, of which Marshall wrote\r\nthirty-six. The decisions of the court during \"the reign of Marshall\"\r\nfill thirty volumes of the Reports. Seven hundred and fifty-three cases\r\nwere taken on appeal to the Supreme Court from the lower federal courts,\r\nand in nearly one half of these cases the decisions were reversed.\r\n\r\nAn American constitutional law did not exist when Marshall took office.\r\nFew precedents were available. In some of his important cases Marshall\r\ndid not cite a single judicial decision. He reached his conclusions by\r\nthe light of reason. \"There, Story,\" he would say to his associate, \"is\r\nthe law. Now you must find the authorities.\" In a peculiar sense it is\r\ntrue to say that Marshall both laid the foundations of constitutional\r\nlaw and reared the superstructure, as one of his biographers remarks.\r\nBut Marshall was ably supported by his colleagues; and he owed much, as\r\nhe freely admitted, to the arguments of a remarkable body of lawyers of\r\nthe federal bar. Wirt, Pinkney, and Webster were as truly creators of\r\nAmerican constitutional law as the learned justices.\r\n\r\nThe constitutional importance of the decision of the Supreme Court in\r\n_Marbury_ v. _Madison_ has already been pointed out. In the development\r\nof the idea of national sovereignty, the significance of the decision\r\nlies in the emphatic assertion that the Supreme Court is the tribunal of\r\nlast resort in cases involving the constitutionality of acts of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe first open resistance of a State to federal authority, as asserted\r\nby the Supreme Court, occurred in 1809, when the legislature of\r\nPennsylvania interposed its authority to prevent the payment of prize\r\nmoney which had been awarded by a federal district court to Gideon\r\nOlmstead and others for their capture of the sloop Active during the\r\nRevolution. All efforts to secure a peaceful settlement of this\r\ncontroversy having failed, the Attorney-General, in behalf of Olmstead,\r\napplied to the Supreme Court for a writ of _mandamus_, directing Judge\r\nPeters of the district court to enforce his judgment. In granting the\r\nwrit, Chief Justice Marshall pointed out the gravity of the issue. \"If\r\nthe legislatures of the several States,\" said he, \"may at will annul the\r\njudgment of the courts of the United States, and destroy the rights\r\nacquired under those judgments, the Constitution becomes a solemn\r\nmockery, and the nation is deprived of the means of enforcing its laws\r\nby the instrumentality of its own tribunals.\" Such a conclusion he\r\nemphatically repudiated. Reviewing the history of the case with all its\r\ndetails, he reached the uncompromising conclusion that \"the State of\r\nPennsylvania can possess no constitutional right to resist the legal\r\nprocess which may be directed in this cause.... A peremptory _mandamus_\r\nmust be awarded.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Peters issued the writ, but all efforts of the marshal to serve\r\nthe writ were thwarted by the state militia. The marshal then summoned a\r\n_posse comitatus_ of two thousand men. Bloodshed seemed imminent; but\r\nafter an ineffectual appeal to the President, the Pennsylvania\r\nauthorities gave way and paid over the money. Subsequently the officer\r\ncommanding the militia and others were indicted, tried, convicted, and\r\nsentenced to fine and imprisonment, for resisting the writ of a federal\r\ncourt; but they were pardoned by the President because \"they had acted\r\nunder a mistaken sense of duty.\"\r\n\r\nIn this conflict of authority the National Government won at every\r\npoint. Even the resolution which the legislature adopted in the heat of\r\nthe controversy, calling for an amendment to the Constitution which\r\nshould establish \"an impartial tribunal to determine disputes between\r\nthe General and State Governments,\" met with no approval from other\r\nStates. Virginia, soon to be of a very different mind, responded that \"a\r\ntribunal is already provided ... to wit: the Supreme Court, more\r\neminently qualified from their habits and duties, from the mode of their\r\nselection, and from the tenure of their offices, to decide the disputes\r\naforesaid in an enlightened and impartial manner, than any other\r\ntribunal which could be erected.\"\r\n\r\nIn two notable cases, the Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality\r\nof the Judiciary Act of 1789 and asserted its authority to review and\r\nreverse decisions of the state courts when those decisions were adverse\r\nto alleged federal rights. The opinion in the first case, that of\r\n_Martin_ v. _Hunter's Lessee_, in 1816, was written by Joseph Story, of\r\nMassachusetts, who had been appointed to a vacancy on the bench by\r\nPresident Madison. Story was reputed to be a Republican, but he\r\ndisappointed all expectations by becoming a stanch supporter of\r\nnationalist doctrines and only second to Marshall in his influence upon\r\nthe development of American constitutional law.\r\n\r\nThe case of _Martin_ v. _Hunter's Lessee_ grew out of the old Fairfax\r\nclaims which Marshall had represented as counsel before his appointment\r\nto the bench. In 1815, the Supreme Court had reversed the decision of\r\nthe Court of Appeals of Virginia, and ordered the state court to execute\r\nthe judgment rendered in the lower state court. The judges of the Court\r\nof Appeals, headed by Judge Spencer Roane, a bitter opponent of\r\nMarshall, formally announced that they would not obey the _mandamus_,\r\nholding that the twenty-fifth section of the Judiciary Act of 1789--that\r\nextending the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court over state\r\ntribunals--was unconstitutional. The state-rights elements in Virginia\r\nquickly rallied to the support of the judges, and the Supreme Court\r\nfound itself face to face with an incensed public opinion in the Old\r\nDominion. In no wise daunted by this opposition, the Supreme Court\r\nreviewed its position in 1816 and again ordered the execution of its\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nFive years later, Chief Justice Marshall rendered a similar decision in\r\nthe case of _Cohens_ v. _Virginia_. The counsel for the Commonwealth had\r\nargued that the appellate jurisdiction conferred by the Constitution on\r\nthe Supreme Court was merely authority to revise the decisions of the\r\ninferior courts of the United States. \"Congress,\" it was contended, \"is\r\nnot authorized to make the supreme court or any other court of a State\r\nan inferior court.... The inferior courts spoken of in the Constitution\r\nare manifestly to be held by federal judges.\" \"It is the case, not the\r\ncourt, that gives jurisdiction,\" replied Marshall. \"The courts of the\r\nUnited States can, without question, revise the proceedings of the\r\nexecutive and legislative authorities of the States, and if they are\r\nfound to be contrary to the Constitution may declare them to be of no\r\nlegal validity. Surely the exercise of the same right over judicial\r\ntribunals is not a higher or more dangerous act of sovereign power.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in the course of this decision that Marshall asserted in\r\nunmistakable language the sovereignty of the National Government. \"The\r\npeople made the Constitution and the people can unmake it.... But this\r\nsupreme and irresistible power to make or to unmake resides only in the\r\nwhole body of the people; not in any subdivision of them. The attempts\r\nof any of the parts to exercise it is usurpation, and ought to be\r\nrepelled by those to whom the people have delegated the power of\r\nrepelling it.... The framers of the Constitution were indeed unable to\r\nmake any provisions which should protect that instrument against a\r\ngeneral combination of the States, or of the people for its destruction;\r\nand conscious of this inability, they have not made the attempt. But\r\nthey were able to provide against the operation of measures adopted in\r\nany one State, whose tendency might be to arrest the execution of the\r\nlaws; and this it was the part of wisdom to attempt. We think they have\r\nattempted it.\"\r\n\r\nBetween these notable Virginia cases was decided, in 1819, the case of\r\n_M'Culloch_ v. _Maryland_, in which the Chief Justice sustained the\r\nconstitutionality of the act establishing the National Bank, and\r\ndeclared a state law imposing a tax on a branch of the Bank\r\nunconstitutional and void. In the course of his opinion, which followed\r\nmuch the same line of reasoning that Alexander Hamilton had employed,\r\nMarshall stated in classic phraseology the doctrine of liberal\r\nconstruction. Holding that the Constitution was not a code of law, but a\r\ndocument marking out in large characters the powers of government, he\r\nsought, among the enumerated powers, not the lesser, but the great\r\nsubstantive, powers necessary to the purposes of the Union. These\r\nsubstantive powers, however, carry with them many incidental (Hamilton\r\nsaid _resulting_) powers, among which a choice may freely be made to\r\nachieve the desired and legitimate end. \"Let the end be legitimate,\"\r\nsaid Marshall, \"let it be within the scope of the Constitution, and all\r\nmeans which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end,\r\nwhich are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the\r\nConstitution, are constitutional.\" In an earlier decision (_United\r\nStates_ v. _Fisher_, 1804), indeed, Marshall had refused to concede the\r\nforce of the argument that the Federal Government was clothed only with\r\nthe powers indispensably necessary to exercise powers expressly granted\r\nto it. \"Congress must possess the choice of means which are in fact\r\nconducive to the exercise of a power granted by the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nThe cumulative effect of these decisions was to provoke a violent\r\nreaction in Virginia. Under the pen-name \"Algernon Sidney,\" Judge Roane\r\nrenewed his attacks upon the Chief Justice in violent and at times\r\noffensive language. \"The judgment before us,\" he declared, referring to\r\nthe case of _Cohens_ v. _Virginia_, \"will not be less disastrous in its\r\nconsequences, than any of these memorable judgments [of the time of\r\nCharles I]. It completely negatives the idea, that the American States\r\nhave a real existence, or are to be considered, in any sense, as\r\nsovereign and independent States.\" It seemed to Jefferson that the\r\npowerful arguments of Roane completely \"pulverized\" every word which had\r\nbeen uttered by John Marshall. John Taylor of Caroline, however, was the\r\nphilosophical exponent of this reactionary movement. In his\r\n_Construction Construed_ (1820), _Tyranny Unmasked_ (1822), and _New\r\nViews of the Constitution_ (1823), he pointed out the manifest tendency\r\nof the decisions of the Supreme Court and suggested the \"state veto\" as\r\nthe remedy against usurpation of power by the Supreme Court or by\r\nCongress. The legislature of Virginia indorsed an amendment to the\r\nConstitution drafted by Judge Roane which would have limited the\r\njurisdiction of the federal courts, where the rights of the States were\r\nconcerned, and which would have forbidden appeals from the courts of a\r\nState to any court of the United States. Beyond such remonstrances and\r\nprotests, however, public opinion in Virginia was not prepared to go at\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\nThe judges of the Supreme Court could not remain indifferent to these\r\nassaults. \"If, indeed, the Judiciary is to be destroyed,\" wrote Story,\r\n\"I should be glad to have the decisive blow now struck, while I am\r\nyoung, and can return to my profession and earn an honest livelihood.\"\r\nBut he added, \"For the Judges of the Supreme Court there is but one\r\ncourse to pursue. That is, to do their duty firmly and honestly,\r\naccording to their best judgments.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in this spirit that the court rendered judgment in the case of\r\n_Green_ v. _Biddle_ (1823), which gave deep offense to the people of\r\nKentucky by setting aside as unconstitutional the so-called \"Occupying\r\nClaimant Laws.\" The remonstrance of the legislature was all the more\r\nbitter because the decision had been rendered by a bench of only four\r\njudges, one of whom dissented from the majority opinion. The resolutions\r\nof the legislature demanded a reorganization of the court in such wise\r\nthat the concurrence of at least two thirds of the judges should be\r\nnecessary in an opinion affecting the validity of state laws. And when\r\nCongress made no response, the lower House called upon the governor to\r\nexpress his opinion \"whether it may be advisable to call forth the\r\nphysical power of the State to resist the execution of the decisions of\r\nthe court, or in what manner the mandates of said court should be met by\r\ndisobedience.\" But Kentucky like Virginia kept well within the legal\r\nlimits of petition and remonstrance.\r\n\r\nIn Ohio, also, there was an ominous spirit of resistance to the force of\r\nprecedent. Notwithstanding the decision of the court in the case of\r\n_M'Culloch_ v. _Maryland_, the general assembly of that State not only\r\nenacted a law to tax the local branch of the National Bank, but actually\r\nseized the amount of the tax. Suit was thereupon brought against the\r\nstate auditor; and in spite of the vigorous remonstrance of the\r\nlegislature, the Supreme Court again sustained the constitutionality of\r\nthe Bank and declared the state tax unconstitutional. The State was\r\nultimately obliged to make restitution of the funds of the Bank.\r\n\r\n[Map: Canals in the United States about 1825]\r\n\r\nMeantime, the national judiciary had contributed to the expansion of the\r\nConstitution in notable ways; sometimes by affirming the\r\nconstitutionality of powers exercised by the President or Congress, and\r\nat other times by narrowing the limits of state authority. In the case\r\nof the _American Insurance Company_ v. _Canter_, twenty-five years after\r\nthe acquisition of Louisiana, Marshall affirmed the constitutionality\r\nof the treaty which had so aroused Jefferson's misgivings. \"The\r\nConstitution,\" said the Chief Justice, \"confers absolutely on the\r\nGovernment of the Union the powers of making war and of making treaties;\r\nconsequently, that Government possesses the power of acquiring\r\nterritory, either by conquest or by treaty.\"\r\n\r\nIn two instances, on the other hand, the Supreme Court gave an\r\ninterpretation of the \"obligation of contracts\" clause of the\r\nConstitution which seriously limited the powers of the States. In the\r\ncase of _Fletcher_ v. _Peck_ (1810), the court declared unconstitutional\r\nan act of the legislature of Georgia which attempted to revoke the\r\nnotorious Yazoo land grants of 1795. A grant was held to be a contract\r\nwithin the meaning of the Constitution; and the court found no adequate\r\nground for exempting such contracts from the prohibition of the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nFar-reaching in its implication, also, was the second instance, when the\r\nSupreme Court held unconstitutional and void the acts of the New\r\nHampshire legislature which amended the charter granted by the Crown to\r\nDartmouth College in 1769. Arguing as counsel for the college, of which\r\nhe was an honored graduate, Daniel Webster held that the charter of a\r\nprivate corporation was a contract which might not be impaired by an act\r\nof a state legislature. Chief Justice Marshall only restated and\r\namplified Webster's argument, when he rendered the opinion of the court\r\nand declared that New Hampshire might not by law impair the charter of\r\nDartmouth College. To the argument of the counsel for the Commonwealth,\r\ncontending that the framers of the Constitution never contemplated such\r\na broad use of the word \"contract,\" Marshall replied that it was not\r\nenough to say this particular use of the word was not in the mind of the\r\nConvention when the article was adopted. \"It is necessary to go farther,\r\nand to say that, had this particular case been suggested, the language\r\nwould have been so varied as to exclude it, or it would have been made a\r\nspecial exception.\"\r\n\r\nThe immense significance of this decision was not immediately apparent.\r\nThe peculiar immunity which it gave to private property could not be\r\nappreciated until the rise of corporations with concentrated capital.\r\nNot even the Chief Justice foresaw that the guaranty of inviolability\r\nwhich he had thrown about a private educational corporation would be\r\ndemanded with equal right by the great business corporations of the\r\nsucceeding era.\r\n\r\n[Map: Highways of the United States about 1825]\r\n\r\nIn the famous case of _Gibbons_ v. _Ogden_ (1824), the Supreme Court\r\ngave an interpretation of the commerce clause of the Constitution which\r\nalso had a profound effect upon subsequent history. In the course of its\r\ndecision the court declared unconstitutional a law of the State of New\r\nYork which had granted an exclusive right to operate steamboats in the\r\nwaters of New York. The regulation of commerce, the court held, had been\r\ngiven exclusively to Congress, and \"commerce\" as used in the\r\nConstitution comprehended not merely traffic and intercourse but also\r\nnavigation. The power to regulate was regarded as a unit. In regulating\r\ncommerce with foreign nations, the power of Congress does not stop at\r\nthe jurisdictional lines of the several States. \"If a foreign voyage may\r\ncommence or terminate at a port within a State, then the power of\r\nCongress may be exercised within a State.\" Similarly, the court reasoned\r\nthat commerce \"among the States\" cannot stop at the external boundary of\r\neach State. \"Commerce among the States must of necessity be commerce\r\nwith the States.\" In short, while expressly disclaiming that Congress\r\nhad the power to regulate the internal commerce of a State, the court\r\nasserted the complete control of Congress over inter-state commerce so\r\nfar as navigation was concerned. The deeper significance of this\r\ninterpretation of the commerce clause appeared only when railroads began\r\nto span the continent and the jurisdictional lines of States were\r\ncrossed and re-crossed by an ever-increasing volume of trade.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five years had wrought a vast change in the position of the\r\nnational judiciary in the American constitutional system. \"It is now\r\nseen on every hand,\" wrote Attorney-General Wirt, urging the appointment\r\nof Chancellor Kent to a vacancy on the Supreme Court bench, \"that the\r\nfunctions to be performed by the Supreme Court of the United States are\r\namong the most difficult and perilous which are to be performed under\r\nthe Constitution. They demand the loftiest range of talents and learning\r\nand a soul of Roman purity and firmness. The questions which come before\r\nthem frequently involve the fate of the Constitution, the happiness of\r\nthe whole Nation, and even its peace as it concerns other nations.\" In\r\nthe light of the decisions reviewed, the nationalizing tendency of the\r\nfederal judiciary is unmistakable. But a constitutional reaction had set\r\nin; and even while John Marshall was setting forth the doctrine of\r\nnational sovereignty in its most uncompromising form, John C. Calhoun in\r\nthe quiet of his estate in South Carolina was elaborating a defense of\r\nstate rights on premises which the great Chief Justice had combated for\r\na quarter of a century.\r\n\r\n\r\n     BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\r\n\r\n     An adequate history of the Supreme Court has yet to be written. H.\r\n     L. Carson, _The History of the Supreme Court of the United States,\r\n     with biographies of all the chief and associate justices_ (2 vols.,\r\n     1902-04), and H. Flanders, _The Lives and Times of the\r\n     Chief-Justices of the Supreme Court_ (2 vols., 1855-58), are\r\n     serviceable works. The best selection of cases on constitutional\r\n     law is that by J. B. Thayer, _Cases in Constitutional Law_ (2 vols.,\r\n     1894-95). Some of the more important decisions may be found\r\n     abridged in Allen Johnson's _Readings in American Constitutional\r\n     History_ (1912). W. W. Willoughby, _The Supreme Court: its History\r\n     and Influence in our Constitutional System_ (1890), and _The American\r\n     Constitutional System_ (1904), are interesting volumes by an\r\n     authority on constitutional law.
