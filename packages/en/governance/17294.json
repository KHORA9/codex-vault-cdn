COLLINS SONS & CO. LTD.\r\nGLASGOW MELBOURNE AUCKLAND\r\nCopyright 1922\r\n\r\n\r\n_Manufactured in Great Britain_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe papers contained in this volume are summaries--in some cases, owing\r\nto the defectiveness of the reports, very much abridged summaries--of a\r\nseries of discourses delivered at the Liberal Summer School at Oxford in\r\nthe first ten days of August, 1922. In two cases (\"The State and\r\nIndustry\" and \"The Machinery of Government\") two lectures have been\r\ncondensed into a single paper.\r\n\r\nThe Summer School was not arranged by any of the official organisations\r\nof the Liberal party, nor was any part of its expenses paid out of party\r\nfunds. It was the outcome of a spontaneous movement among a number of\r\nmen and women who, believing that Liberalism is beyond all other\r\npolitical creeds dependent upon the free discussion of ideas, came to\r\nthe conclusion that it was desirable to create a platform upon which\r\nsuch discussion could be carried on, in a manner quite different from\r\nwhat is usual, or indeed practicable, at ordinary official party\r\ngatherings. From the first the movement received cordial support and\r\nencouragement from the leaders of the party, who were more than content\r\nthat a movement so essentially Liberal in character should be carried\r\non quite independently of any official control. The meetings were\r\ninaugurated by an address by Mr. Asquith, and wound up by a valediction\r\nfrom Lord Grey, while nearly all the recognised leaders of the party\r\npresided at one or more of the meetings, or willingly consented to give\r\nlectures. In short, while wholly unofficial, the meetings drew together\r\nall that is most vital in modern Liberalism.\r\n\r\nIn some degree the Summer School represented a new departure in\r\npolitical discussion. Most of the lectures were delivered, not by active\r\npoliticians, but by scholars and experts whose distinction has been won\r\nin other fields than practical politics. One or two of the speakers\r\nwere, indeed, not even professed Liberals. They were invited to speak\r\nbecause it was known that on their subjects they would express the true\r\nmind of modern Liberalism. Whatever Lord Robert Cecil, for example, may\r\ncall himself, Liberals at any rate recognise that on most subjects he\r\nexpresses their convictions.\r\n\r\nAs a glance at the list of contents will show, the papers cover almost\r\nthe whole range of political interest, foreign, domestic, and imperial,\r\nbut the greatest emphasis is laid upon the problems of economic and\r\nindustrial organisation. Yet, since it is impossible to survey the\r\nuniverse in ten days, there are large and important themes which remain\r\nunexplored, while many subjects of vital significance are but lightly\r\ntouched upon. Perhaps the most notable of these omissions is that of any\r\ntreatment of local government, and of the immensely important\r\nsubjects--education, public health, housing, and the like--for which\r\nlocal authorities are primarily held responsible. These subjects are\r\nheld over for fuller treatment in later schools; and for that reason two\r\npapers--one on local government and one on education--which were\r\ndelivered at Oxford have not been included in the present volume.\r\n\r\nIt must be obvious, from what has been said above, that these papers\r\nmake no pretence to define what may be called an official programme or\r\npolicy for the Liberal party. It was with study rather than with\r\nprogramme-making that the School was concerned, and its aim was the\r\nstimulation of free inquiry rather than the formulation of dogmas. Every\r\nspeaker was, and is, responsible for the views expressed in his paper,\r\nthough not for the form which the abridged report of it has assumed; and\r\nthere are doubtless passages in this book which would not win the assent\r\nof all Liberals, for Liberalism has always encouraged and welcomed\r\nvarieties of opinion.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, taken as a whole, these papers do fairly represent the\r\noutlook and temper of modern Liberalism. And the candid reader will not\r\nfail to recognise in them a certain unity of tone and temper, in spite\r\nof the diversity of their authorship and subject-matter. Whether the\r\nsubject is foreign politics, or imperial problems, or government, or\r\nindustry, the same temper shows itself--a belief in freedom rather than\r\nin regimentation; an earnest desire to substitute law for force; a\r\nbelief in persuasion rather than in compulsion as the best mode of\r\nsolving difficult problems; an eagerness to establish organised methods\r\nof discussion and co-operation as the best solvent of strife, in\r\ninternational relations and in industrial affairs quite as much as in\r\nthe realm of national politics, to which these methods have long since\r\nbeen applied.\r\n\r\nThat is the spirit of modern Liberalism, which gives unity to the\r\ndiversity of this little volume. As has often been said, Liberalism is\r\nan attitude of mind rather than a body of definitely formulated\r\ndoctrine. It does not claim to know of any formula which will guide us\r\nout of all our troubles, or of any panacea that will cure every social\r\nill. It recognises that we are surrounded in every field of social and\r\npolitical life by infinitely difficult problems for which there is no\r\neasy solution. It puts its trust in the honest inquiry and thought of\r\nfree men who take their civic responsibilities seriously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n                                                            PAGE\r\nPreface                                                        v\r\n\r\nThe League of Nations and the\r\nRehabilitation of Europe          _Rt.

LORD ROBERT CECIL\r\n\r\nK.C., M.P., Assistant Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, 1918.\r\nMinister of Blockade, 1916-1918. Representative of Union of South Africa\r\nat Assembly of League of Nations.\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Robert Cecil said:--I ought to explain that I am here rather by\r\naccident. The speaker who was to have addressed you was my great\r\npersonal friend, Professor Gilbert Murray, and you have greatly suffered\r\nbecause he is not present. He is prevented by being at Geneva on a\r\nmatter connected with the League, and he suggested that I might take his\r\nplace. I was very glad to do so, for, let me say quite frankly, I am\r\nready to advocate the League of Nations before any assembly, certainly\r\nnot least an assembly of Liberals. But not only an assembly of\r\nLiberals--I should be ready to advocate it even before an assembly of\r\n\"Die-Hards.\"\r\n\r\nYour chairman has said, and said truly, that the League is not a party\r\nquestion. We welcome, we are anxious for support from every one. We have\r\nseen in another great country the very grave danger that may accrue to\r\nthe cause of the League if it unhappily becomes identified with party\r\npolitics. We welcome support, yes, I will say even from the Prime\r\nMinister; indeed no one will reject the support of the Prime Minister of\r\nEngland for any cause. I am bound to admit when I first read the speech\r\nto which reference has already been made, I was a little reminded of the\r\ncelebrated letter of Dr. Johnson to Lord Chesterfield. Lord Chesterfield\r\nonly began to recognise the value of Johnson's works when Johnson had\r\nalready succeeded, and in one of the bitter phrases Dr. Johnson then\r\nused he said, \"Is not a patron one who looks with unconcern on a man\r\nstruggling for life in the water, and when he has reached ground\r\nincommodes him with help?\" That was a passing phase in my mind, and I am\r\na little ashamed of it, because, after all, we cannot say the League has\r\nreached ground as yet. We need and are grateful for the help of any one\r\nwho will genuinely come to its assistance. I hope we may look not only\r\nfor words, but for deeds. The League needs all the support it can get in\r\nthe very perilous and menacing times which are before us. I was glad to\r\nnote that the Government has announced--it is one of the great test\r\nquestions--that not only is it in favour of the entry of Germany into\r\nthe League, but it would support the election of Germany to the Council\r\nof the League. That is an earnest of what we trust may be a real League\r\npolicy from the Government of this country. And yet, though I have\r\nthought it right to emphasise the non-party aspect of this question, I\r\nam conscious, and I am sure all of you are, there are two ways in which\r\nthe League is regarded. It is not only that, as your chairman would\r\nsay, some people have more faith than others, but there is really a\r\ndistinct attitude of mind adopted by some supporters of the League from\r\nthat adopted by others.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWO VIEWS OF THE LEAGUE\r\n\r\nThere is what I may call the empirical view of the League. There are\r\nthose of us in this country, and indeed all over the world, who,\r\nprofoundly impressed with the horrors of war, hating war from the bottom\r\nof their hearts as an evil thing--a company which must include, as far\r\nas I can see, all Christian men and women--these people, impressed with\r\nthe horrors of war, look about for some means of keeping it away, some\r\nsafeguard against its renewal. And they say: \"We have tried everything\r\nelse, we have tried the doctrine of the preparation for war as a great\r\nsafeguard of peace; we have tried the doctrine of the Balance of Power;\r\nwe have tried the doctrine of making one State or group of States so\r\npowerful that it can enforce its will on the rest of the world. We have\r\ntried all these expedients, and we are driven to the conclusion that\r\nthey lead not to peace, but to war. Is there anything else?\" And then\r\nthey come quite legitimately to the League as their last hope of\r\npreserving the peace of the world. I was talking to a distinguished\r\nFrenchman the other day, and that was his attitude. It is the attitude\r\nof a great many people. In my judgment it is quite sound as far as it\r\ngoes. But it is not inspiring. It depends in the last resort merely on\r\na frank appeal to the terrors of mankind.\r\n\r\nAgainst that view you may set the more fundamental way of approaching\r\nthis question. You may say if you are to have peace in the world it is\r\nnot enough merely to provide safeguards against war. You must aim at\r\ncreating a new international spirit, a new spirit in international\r\naffairs; you must build from the very foundations. That is the positive\r\nas opposed to the negative way of approaching this question. It is not\r\nenough to cast out the war spirit and leave its habitation swept and\r\ngarnished. You have to replace the war spirit by a spirit of\r\ninternational co-operation. And that is the way of regarding this great\r\nmovement which some people think can be disposed of by describing it as\r\nidealism--a favourite term of abuse, I learn, now, but which seems to me\r\nnot only good politics and good morality, but common sense as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEGATIVE AND THE POSITIVE\r\n\r\nThese two points of view do represent undoubtedly fundamental\r\ndifferences of political attitude, and you will find that the two sets\r\nof advocates or supporters of the League whom I have tried to describe,\r\nwill inevitably regard with different emphasis the provisions of the\r\nCovenant, and even the achievements of the League. For if you read the\r\nCovenant you will find two sets of provisions in that document. It does\r\nrecognise the two schools, as it were, that I have been describing. It\r\nhas a set of provisions which deal with the enforcement, the\r\nsafeguarding of peace, and a set of provisions which deal with the\r\nbuilding up of international co-operation. You will notice the two sets\r\nof provisions. There are those aiming directly at the settlement of\r\ndisputes without war. This is the central part of the League. It is the\r\nfirst thing before you can hope to do anything else. Before you can\r\nbegin to build up your international spirit you must get rid as far as\r\nyou can of the actual menace of war; and in that sense this is the\r\ncentral part of the Covenant. But, in my view, the most enduring and\r\nperhaps the most important part is that set of provisions which cluster\r\nround the group of articles beginning with Article 10 perhaps, certainly\r\nArticle 12, and going on to Article 17--the group which says in effect\r\nthat before nations submit their disputes to the arbitrament of war they\r\nare bound to try every other means of settling their differences. It\r\nlays down first the principle that every dispute should come to some\r\nkind of arbitration, either by the new Court of International\r\nJustice--one of the great achievements of the League--or discussion\r\nbefore a specially constituted Arbitration Court, or failing both, then\r\ndiscussion before the Council of the League; and Articles 15 and 16\r\nprovide that until that discussion has taken place, and until adequate\r\ntime has been allowed for the public opinion of the world to operate on\r\nthe disputants as the result of that examination, no war is to take\r\nplace, and if any war takes place the aggressor is to be regarded as\r\nperhaps what may be called an international outlaw.\r\n\r\nBefore you begin to build you must have freedom from actual war, and\r\nthe provisions have been effective. They are not merely theoretic. I am\r\nnot sure whether it is generally recognised, even in so instructed an\r\nassembly as this, how successful these provisions have actually been in\r\npractice. Let me give you briefly two illustrations: the dispute between\r\nSweden and Finland, and the much more urgent case of the dispute between\r\nSerbia and Albania. In the first case you had a dispute about the\r\npossession of certain islands in the Baltic. It was boiling up to be a\r\nserious danger to the peace of the world. It was referred to the League\r\nfor discussion. It was before the existence of the International Court.\r\nA special tribunal was constituted. The matter was threshed out with\r\ngreat elaboration; a decision was come to which, it is interesting to\r\nobserve, was a decision against the stronger of the two parties. It was\r\naccepted, not with enthusiasm by the party that lost, but with great\r\nloyalty. It has been adopted, worked out in its details by other organs\r\nof the League, and as far as one can tell, as far as it is safe to\r\nprophesy about anything, it has absolutely closed that dispute, and the\r\ntwo countries are living in a greater degree of amity than existed\r\nbefore the dispute became acute.\r\n\r\nBut the Albanian case is stronger. You had a very striking case: a small\r\ncountry only just struggling into international existence. Albania had\r\nonly just been created before the war as an independent State, and\r\nduring the war its independence had in effect vanished. The first thing\r\nthat happened was its application for membership of the League. That\r\nwas granted, and thereby Albania came into existence really for the\r\nfirst time as an independent State. Then came its effort to secure the\r\nboundaries to which it was entitled, which had been provisionally\r\nawarded to it before the war. While that dispute was still unsettled,\r\nits neighbour, following some rather disastrous examples given by\r\ngreater people in Europe, thought to solve the question by seizing even\r\nmore of the land of Albania than it already occupied. Thereupon the\r\nArticles of the Covenant were brought into operation. The Council was\r\nhastily summoned within a few days. It was known that this country was\r\nprepared to advocate before that Council the adoption of the coercive\r\nmeasures described in Article 16. The Council met, and the aggressive\r\nState immediately recognised that as a member of the League it had no\r\ncourse open but to comply with its obligations, and that as a prudent\r\nState it dared not face the danger which would be caused to it by the\r\noperation of Article 16. Immediately, before the dispute had actually\r\nbeen developed, before the Council, the Serbians announced that they\r\nwere prepared to withdraw from Albanian territory, and gave orders to\r\ntheir troops to retire beyond the boundary. Let us recognise that this\r\ndecision having been come to, it was carried out with absolute loyalty\r\nand completeness. The troops withdrew. The territory was restored to\r\nAlbania without a hitch. No ill-feeling remains behind, and the next\r\nthing we hear is that a commercial treaty is entered into between the\r\ntwo States, so that they can live in peace and amity together.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPIRIT OF THE LEAGUE\r\n\r\nI want to emphasise one point about these two cases. It is not so much\r\nthat the coercive powers provided in the Covenant were effectively used.\r\nIn Sweden and Finland they never came into the question at all, and in\r\nthe other case there was merely a suggestion of their operation. What\r\nreally brought about a settlement of these two disputes was that the\r\ncountries concerned really desired peace, and were really anxious to\r\ncomply with their obligations as members of the League of Nations. That\r\nis the essential thing--the League spirit. And if you want to see how\r\nessential it is you have to compare another international incident: the\r\ndispute between Poland and Lithuania, where the League spirit was\r\nconspicuous by its absence. There you had a dispute of the same\r\ncharacter. But ultimately you did secure this: that from the date of the\r\nintervention of the League till the present day--about two years--there\r\nhas been no fighting; actual hostilities were put an end to. Though that\r\nis in itself an immensely satisfactory result, and an essential\r\npreliminary for all future international progress, yet one must add that\r\nthe dispute still continues, and there is much recrimination and\r\nbitterness between the two countries. The reason why only partial\r\nsuccess has been attained is because one must say Poland has shown a\r\nmiserable lack of the true spirit of the League.\r\n\r\nLet me turn to the other parts of the Covenant--those which aim\r\ndirectly at building up international co-operation. I am not sure that\r\nit is always sufficiently realised that that is not only an implicit but\r\nalso an explicit object of the Covenant--that it is the main purpose for\r\nwhich the League exists. International co-operation are the very first\r\nwords of the preamble to the Covenant. This is the fundamental idea I\r\ncannot insist on too strongly, because it does really go down to the\r\nvery foundations of my whole creed in political matters. International\r\nco-operation, class co-operation, individual co-operation--that is the\r\nessential spirit if we are to solve the difficulties before us. Let me\r\nremind you of the two instances of the action of the League in dealing\r\nwith the threat of epidemics to Europe. A conference was called at\r\nWashington to consider what could be done to save Europe from the danger\r\nof epidemics coming from the East. What is interesting is that in that\r\nconference you had present not only members of the League considering\r\nand devising means for the safety of Europe, but you had representatives\r\nof Germany and Russia--a splendid example of the promotion of\r\ninternational co-operation extending even beyond the limits of the\r\nmembership of the League. Admirable work was done. All countries\r\nco-operated quite frankly and willingly under the presidency of a\r\ndistinguished Polish scientist.\r\n\r\nThat is one example of what we mean by international co-operation.\r\nPerhaps an even more striking example was the great work of Dr. Nansen\r\nin liberating the prisoners of war who were in Russia. He was entrusted\r\nwith the work on behalf of the League. The prisoners of war belonged to\r\nall nationalities, including our enemies in the late war. He\r\naccomplished his work because he went about it in the true spirit of the\r\nLeague, merely anxious to promote the welfare of all, leaving aside all\r\nprejudices whether arising from the war or from any other cause. Dr.\r\nNansen is in my judgment the incarnation of the spirit of the League,\r\nand his work, immensely successful, restored to their homes some 350,000\r\npersons, and he did it for less money than he originally estimated it\r\nwould cost.\r\n\r\nDo not put me down as a facile optimist in this matter. In the matter of\r\ninternational co-operation we have a long way to go before we reach our\r\ngoal, and we can already see one or two serious failures. I deeply\r\ndeplore that last year the League found itself unable, through the\r\ninstructions given by the Governments which composed it, to do anything\r\neffective on behalf of the famine in Russia. It was a most deplorable\r\nfailure for the League, and still more deplorable for this country. It\r\nwas a great opportunity for us to show that we really did mean to be\r\nactuated by a new spirit in international affairs, and that we did\r\nrecognise that the welfare of all human beings was part--if you like to\r\nput it so--of our national interests. We failed to make that\r\nrecognition. We have been trying feebly and unsuccessfully to repair\r\nthat great mistake ever since, and for my part I do not believe there is\r\nany hope of a solution of the Russian difficulty until we absolutely\r\nacknowledge the failure we then made, and begin even at this late hour\r\nto retrace the false step we then took.\r\n\r\nI could give other instances of failure, but I do not wish to depress\r\nyou, and there are cheering things we may look at. It is a matter of\r\ngreat relief and congratulation that the policy of mandates really does\r\nappear to be becoming effective, and one of the greatest activities of\r\nthe League. Nothing is better than the conception which the mandate\r\nclause embodies, that the old ideas of conquest are to be put aside;\r\nthat you are not to allow nations to go out and take chunks of territory\r\nfor themselves; that they must hold new territory not for themselves,\r\nbut on behalf of and for the benefit of mankind at large. This is at the\r\nbottom of mandates. Since I am speaking on behalf of Professor Murray, I\r\nought to remind you of the provisions of the Covenant for the protection\r\nof racial linguistic minorities, and minorities in different countries.\r\nIt has not yet become an effective part of the machinery of the League,\r\nbut I look forward to the time when we shall have established the\r\ndoctrine that all racial minorities are entitled to be treated on a\r\nfooting absolutely equal with other nationals of the country in which\r\nthey live. If that could be established, one of the great difficulties\r\nin the way of international co-operation in the spirit of peace will be\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MISTAKE OF VERSAILLES\r\n\r\nThese are the two aspects I wanted to bring before you. If we are to get\r\ndown to the root of the matter; if we are to uproot the old jungle\r\ntheory of international relations, we must recognise that the chief\r\ndanger and difficulty before us is what may be described as excessive\r\nnationalism. We have to recognise in this and other countries that a\r\nmere belief in narrow national interests will never really take you\r\nanywhere. You must recognise that humanity can only exist and prosper as\r\na whole, and that you cannot separate the nation in which you live, and\r\nsay you will work for its prosperity and welfare alone, without\r\nconsidering that its prosperity and welfare depend on that of others.\r\nAnd the differences on that point go right through a great deal of the\r\npolitical thought of the day.\r\n\r\nTake the question of reparations. I am not going to discuss in detail\r\nwhat ought to be done in that difficult and vexed question, but I want\r\nto call your attention to the mistake which was originally made, and\r\nwhich we have never yet been able to retrieve. The fundamental error of\r\nVersailles was the failure to recognise that even in dealing with a\r\nconquered enemy you can only successfully proceed by co-operation. That\r\nwas the mistake--the idea that the victorious Powers could impose their\r\nwill without regard to the feelings and desires and national sentiment\r\nof their enemy, even though he was beaten. For the first time in the\r\nhistory of peace conferences, the vanquished Power was not allowed to\r\ntake part in any real discussion of the terms of the treaty. The\r\nattitude adopted was, \"These are our terms, take or leave them, but you\r\nwill get nothing else.\" No attempt was made to appreciate, or even\r\ninvestigate the view put forward by the Germans on that occasion. And\r\nlast, but not least, they were most unfortunately excluded from\r\nmembership of the League at that time. I felt profoundly indignant with\r\nthe Germans and their conduct of the war. I still believe it was due\r\nalmost exclusively to the German policy and the policy of their rulers\r\nthat the war took place, and that it was reasonable and right to feel\r\nprofound indignation, and to desire that international misdeeds of that\r\ncharacter should be adequately punished. But what was wrong was to think\r\nthat you could as a matter of practice or of international ethics try to\r\nimpose by main force a series of provisions without regard to the\r\nconsent or dissent of the country on which you were trying to impose\r\nthem. That is part of the heresy that force counts for everything. I\r\nwish some learned person in Oxford or elsewhere would write an essay to\r\nshow how little force has been able to achieve in the world. And the\r\ncurious and the really remarkable thing is that it was this heresy which\r\nbrought Germany herself to grief. It is because of the false and immoral\r\nbelief in the all-powerfulness of force that Germany has fallen, and yet\r\nthose opposed to Germany, though they conquered her, adopted only too\r\nmuch of her moral code.\r\n\r\nIt was because the Allies really adopted the doctrine of the mailed fist\r\nthat we are now suffering from the terrible economic difficulties and\r\ndangers which surround us. I venture to insist on that now, because\r\nthere are a large number of people who have not abandoned that view.\r\nThere are still a number of people who think the real failure that has\r\nbeen committed is not that we went wrong, as I think, in our\r\nnegotiations at Versailles, but that we have not exerted enough force,\r\nand that the remedy for the present situation is more threats of force.\r\nI am sure it won't answer. I want to say that that doctrine is just as\r\npernicious when applied to France as when applied to Germany. You have\r\nmade an agreement. You have signed and ratified a treaty; you are\r\ninternationally bound by that treaty. It is no use turning round and\r\nwith a new incarnation of the policy of the mailed fist threatening one\r\nof your co-signatories that they are bound to abandon the rights which\r\nyou wrongly and foolishly gave to them under that treaty.\r\n\r\nI am against a policy based on force as applied to Germany. I am equally\r\nopposed to a policy based on force as applied to France. If we really\r\nunderstand the creed for which we stand, we must aim at co-operation all\r\nround. If we have made a mistake we must pay for it. If we are really\r\nanxious to bring peace to the world, and particularly to Europe, we must\r\nbe prepared for sacrifices. We have got to establish economic peace, and\r\nif we don't establish it in a very short time we shall be faced with\r\neconomic ruin. In the strictest, most nationalistic interests of this\r\ncountry, we have to see that economic war comes to an end. We have got\r\nto make whatever concessions are necessary in order to bring that peace\r\ninto being.\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC PEACE\r\n\r\nThat is true not only of the reparation question; it is true of our\r\nwhole economic policy. We have been preaching to Europe, and quite\r\nrightly, that the erection of economic barriers between countries is a\r\ntreachery to the whole spirit of the League of Nations, and all that it\r\nmeans, and yet with these words scarcely uttered we turn round and pass\r\nthrough Parliament a new departure in our economic system which is the\r\nvery contradiction of everything we have said in international\r\nconference.\r\n\r\nThe Safeguarding of Industries Act is absolutely opposed to the whole\r\nspirit and purpose which the League of Nations has in view. A reference\r\nwas made by your chairman to Lord Grey, and I saw in a very\r\ndistinguished organ of the Coalition an attack on his recent speech. We\r\nare told that he ought not at this crisis to be suggesting that the\r\npresent Government is not worthy of our confidence, but how can we trust\r\nthe present Government? How is it possible to trust them when one finds\r\nat Brussels, at Genoa, at the Hague, and elsewhere they preach the\r\nnecessity of the economic unity of Europe, and then go down to the House\r\nof Commons and justify this Act on the strictest, the baldest, the most\r\nunvarnished doctrine of economic particularism for this country? Nor\r\ndoes it stop there. I told you just now that for me this doctrine on\r\nwhich the League is based goes right through many other problems than\r\nthose of a strictly international character. You will never solve\r\nIndian or Egyptian difficulties by a reliance on force and force alone.\r\nI believe that the deplorable, the scandalous condition to which the\r\nneighbouring island of Ireland has been reduced is largely due to the\r\nfailure to recognise that by unrestricted unreasoning, and sometimes\r\nimmoral force, you cannot reach the solution of the difficulties of that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAnd in industry it is the same thing. If you are really to get a\r\nsolution of these great problems, depend upon it you will never do it by\r\nstrikes and lock-outs. I am an outsider in industrial matters. I am\r\nreproached when I venture to say anything about them with the\r\nobservation that I am no business man. I can only hope that in this case\r\nlookers-on may sometimes see most of the game. But to me it is\r\nprofoundly depressing when I see whichever section of the industrial\r\nworld happens to have the market with it--whether employers or\r\nwage-earners--making it its only concern to down the other party as much\r\nas it can. You will never reach a solution that way. You have to\r\nrecognise in industrial as in international affairs that the spirit of\r\nco-operation, the spirit of partnership, is your only hope of salvation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWO CAUSES OF UNREST\r\n\r\nWhat is the conclusion of what I have tried to say to you? There are at\r\nthe present time two great causes of fighting and hostility. There used\r\nto be three. There was a time when men fought about religious doctrine,\r\nand though I do not defend it, it was perhaps less sordid than some of\r\nour fights to-day. Now the two great causes of fighting are greed and\r\nfear. Generally speaking, I think we may say that greed in international\r\nmatters is a less potent cause of hostility than fear. The disease the\r\nworld is suffering from is the disease of fear and suspicion. You see it\r\nbetween man and man, between class and class, and most of all between\r\nnation and nation. People reproach this great country and other great\r\ncountries with being unreasonable or unwilling to make concessions. If\r\nyou look deeply into it you will find always the same cause. It is not\r\nmere perversity; it is fear and fear alone that makes men unreasonable\r\nand contentious. It is no new thing; it has existed from the foundation\r\nof the world. The Prime Minister the other day said, and said quite\r\ntruly, that the provisions of the Covenant, however admirable, were not\r\nin themselves sufficient to secure the peace of the world. He made an\r\nappeal, quite rightly, to the religious forces and organisations to\r\nassist. I agree, but after all something may be done by political\r\naction, and something by international organisation. In modern medicine\r\ndoctors are constantly telling us they cannot cure any disease--all they\r\ncan do is to give nature a chance. No Covenant will teach men to be\r\nmoral or peace-loving, but you can remove, diminish, or modify the\r\nconditions which make for war, and take obstacles out of the way of\r\npeace. We advocate partnership in industry and social life. We advocate\r\nself-government, international co-operation. We recognise that these are\r\nno ends in themselves; they are means to the end; they are the\r\ninfluences which will facilitate the triumph of the right and impede the\r\nsuccess of the wrong.\r\n\r\nBut looking deeper into the matter, to the very foundations, we\r\nrecognise, all of us, the most devoted adherents of the League, and all\r\nmen of goodwill, that in the end we must strive for the brotherhood of\r\nman. We admit we can do comparatively little to help it forward. We\r\nrecognise that our efforts, whether by covenant or other means, must\r\nnecessarily be imperfect; but we say, and say rightly, that we have been\r\ntold that perfect love casteth out fear, and that any step towards that\r\nlove, however imperfect, will at any rate mitigate the terrors of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BALANCE OF POWER\r\n\r\nBY PROFESSOR A.F. POLLARD\r\n\r\nHon. Litt.D.; Fellow of All Souls' College, Oxford; F.B.A.; Professor of\r\nEnglish History in the University of London; Chairman of the Institute\r\nof Historical Research.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Pollard said:--The usual alternative to the League of Nations,\r\nput forward as a means of averting war by those who desire or profess to\r\ndesire permanent peace, but dislike or distrust the League of Nations,\r\nis what they call the Balance of Power. It is a familiar phrase; but the\r\nthing for which the words are supposed to stand, has, if it can save us\r\nfrom war, so stupendous a virtue that it is worth while inquiring what\r\nit means, if it has any meaning at all. For words are not the same as\r\nthings, and the more a phrase is used the less it tends to mean: verbal\r\ncurrency, like the coinage, gets worn with use until in time it has to\r\nbe called in as bad. The time has come to recall the Balance of Power as\r\na phrase that has completely lost the value it possessed when originally\r\nit was coined.\r\n\r\nRecent events have made an examination of the doctrine of the Balance of\r\nPower a matter of some urgency. The Allies who won the war concluded a\r\npact to preserve the peace, but in that pact they have not yet been able\r\nto include Germany or Russia or the United States, three Powers which\r\nare, potentially at any rate, among the greatest in the world. So, some\r\nfifty years ago, Bismarck, who won three wars in the mid-Victorian age,\r\nset himself to build up a pact of peace. But his Triple Alliance was not\r\nonly used to restrain, but abused to repress, the excluded Powers; and\r\nthat abuse of a pact of peace drove the excluded Powers, France and\r\nRussia, into each other's arms. There resulted the Balance of Power\r\nwhich produced the war we have barely survived. And hardly was the great\r\nwar fought and won than we saw the wheel beginning to revolve once more.\r\nThe excluded Powers, repressed or merely restrained, began to draw\r\ntogether; others than Turkey might gravitate in the same direction,\r\nwhile the United States stands in splendid isolation as much aloof as we\r\nwere from the Triple Alliance and the Dual Entente a generation ago.\r\nAnother Balance of Power loomed on the horizon. \"Let us face the facts,\"\r\ndeclared the _Morning Post_ on 22nd April last, \"we are back again to\r\nthe doctrine of the Balance of Power, whatever the visionaries and the\r\nblind may say.\" I propose to deal, as faithfully as I can in the time at\r\nmy disposal, with the visionaries and the blind--when we have discovered\r\nwho they are.\r\n\r\nBy \"visionaries\" I suppose the _Morning Post_ means those who believe in\r\nthe League of Nations; and by the \"blind\" I suppose it means them, too,\r\nthough usually a distinction is drawn between those who see too much and\r\nthose who cannot see at all. Nor need we determine whether those who\r\nbelieve in the Balance of Power belong rather to the visionaries or to\r\nthe blind. A man may be receiving less than his due when he is asked\r\nwhether he is a knave or a fool, because the form of the question seems\r\nto preclude the proper answer, which may be \"both.\" Believers in the\r\nBalance of Power are visionaries if they see in it a guarantee of peace,\r\nand blind if they fail to perceive that it naturally and almost\r\ninevitably leads to war. The fundamental antithesis is between the\r\nBalance of Power and the League of Nations.\r\n\r\n\r\nBALANCE OR LEAGUE?\r\n\r\nThat antithesis comes out wherever the problem of preserving the peace\r\nof the world is seriously and intelligently discussed. Six years ago,\r\nwhen he began to turn his attention to this subject, Lord Robert Cecil\r\nwrote and privately circulated a memorandum in which he advocated\r\nsomething like a League of Nations. To that memorandum an able reply was\r\ndrafted by an eminent authority in the Foreign Office, in which it was\r\ncontended that out of the discussion \"the Balance of Power emerges as\r\nthe fundamental factor.\" That criticism for the time being checked\r\nofficial leanings towards a League of Nations. But the war went on,\r\nthreatening to end in a balance of power, which was anything but welcome\r\nto those who combined a theoretical belief in the Balance of Power with\r\na practical demand for its complete destruction by an overwhelming\r\nvictory for our Allies and ourselves. Meanwhile, before America came\r\nin, President Wilson was declaring that, in order to guarantee the\r\npermanence of such a settlement as would commend itself to the United\r\nStates, there must be, not \"a Balance of Power but a Community of\r\nPower.\"\r\n\r\nOpinion in England was moving in the same direction. The League of\r\nNations Society (afterwards called \"Union\") had been formed, and at a\r\ngreat meeting on 14th May, 1917, speeches advocating some such league as\r\nthe best means of preventing future wars were delivered by Lord Bryce,\r\nGeneral Smuts, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Hugh Cecil, and\r\nothers. Labour was even more emphatic; and, responding to popular\r\nopinion, the Government, at Christmas, 1917, appointed a small committee\r\nto explore the historical, juridical, and diplomatic bearings of the\r\nsuggested solution. A brief survey sufficed to show that attempts to\r\nguarantee the peace of the world resolved themselves into three\r\ncategories: (1) a Monopoly of Power, (2) Balance of Power, and (3)\r\nCommunity of Power. Rome had established the longest peace in history by\r\nsubjugating all her rivals and creating a _Pax Romana_ imposed by a\r\nworld-wide Empire. That Empire lasted for centuries, and the idea\r\npersisted throughout the middle ages. In modern times Philip II. of\r\nSpain, Louis XIV. of France, Napoleon, and even the Kaiser were\r\nsuspected of attempting to revive it; and their efforts provoked the\r\ncounter idea, first of a Balance of Power, and then in these latter days\r\nof a Community of Power. The conception of a Monopoly of Power was by\r\ncommon consent abandoned as impossible and intolerable, after the rise\r\nof nationality, by all except the particular aspirants to the monopoly.\r\nThe Balance of Power and the Community of Power--in other words, the\r\nLeague of Nations--thus became the two rival solutions of the problem of\r\npermanent peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THEORY OF BALANCE\r\n\r\nThe discussion of their respective merits naturally led to an inquiry\r\ninto what the alternative policies really meant. But inasmuch as the\r\nForeign Office committee found itself able to agree in recommending some\r\nform of League of Nations, the idea of the Balance of Power was not\r\nsubjected to so close a scrutiny or so searching an analysis as would\r\ncertainly have been the case had the committee realised the possibility\r\nthat reaction against an imperfect League of Nations might bring once\r\nmore to the front the idea of the Balance of Power. The fact was,\r\nhowever, elicited that the Foreign Office conception of the Balance of\r\nPower is a conception erroneously supposed to have been expressed by\r\nCastlereagh at the time of the Congress of Vienna, and adopted as the\r\nleading principle of nineteenth century British foreign policy.\r\n\r\nCastlereagh was not, of course, the author of the phrase or of the\r\npolicy. The phrase can be found before the end of the seventeenth\r\ncentury; and in the eighteenth the policy was always pleaded by\r\npotentates and Powers when on the defensive, and ignored by them when in\r\npursuit of honour or vital interests. But Castlereagh defined it afresh\r\nafter the colossal disturbance of the balance which Napoleon effected;\r\nand he explained it as \"a just repartition of force amongst the States\r\nof Europe.\" They were, so to speak, to be rationed by common agreement.\r\nThere were to be five or six Great Powers, whose independence was to be\r\nabove suspicion and whose strength was to be restrained by the jealous\r\nwatchfulness of one another. If any one State, like France under\r\nNapoleon, grew too powerful, all the rest were to combine to restrain\r\nit.\r\n\r\nNow, there is a good deal in common between Castlereagh's idea and that\r\nof the League of Nations. Of course, there are obvious differences.\r\nCastlereagh's Powers were monarchies rather than peoples; they were\r\nlimited to Europe; little regard was paid to smaller States, whose\r\nindependence sometimes rested on no better foundation than the inability\r\nof the Great Powers to agree about their absorption; and force rather\r\nthan law or public opinion was the basis of the scheme. But none of\r\nthese differences, important though they were, between Castlereagh's\r\nBalance of Power and the League of Nations is so fundamental as the\r\ndifference between two things which are commonly regarded as identical,\r\nviz., Castlereagh's idea of the Balance of Power and the meaning which\r\nhas since become attached to the phrase. There are at least two senses\r\nin which it has been used, and the two are wholly incompatible with one\r\nanother. The League of Nations in reality resembles Castlereagh's\r\nBalance of Power more closely than does the conventional notion of that\r\nbalance; and a verbal identity has concealed a real diversity to the\r\nconfusion of all political thought on the subject.\r\n\r\nCastlereagh's Balance of Power is what I believe mathematicians call a\r\nmultiple balance. It was not like a pair of scales, in which you have\r\nonly two weights or forces balanced one against the other. It was rather\r\nlike a chandelier, in which you have five or six different weights\r\nco-operating to produce a general stability or equilibrium. In\r\nCastlereagh's scheme it would not much matter if one of the weights were\r\na little heavier than the others, because there would be four or five of\r\nthese others to counterbalance it; and his assumption was that these\r\nother Powers would naturally combine for the purpose of redressing the\r\nbalance and preserving the peace. But a simple balance between two\r\nopposing forces is a very different thing. If there are only two, you\r\nhave no combination on which you can rely to counteract the increasing\r\npower of either, and the slightest disturbance suffices to upset the\r\nbalance. Castlereagh's whole scheme therefore presupposed the continued\r\nand permanent existence of some five or six great Powers always\r\npreserving their independence in foreign policy and war, and\r\nautomatically acting as a check upon the might and ambition of any\r\nsingle State.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHANGE SINCE CASTLEREAGH\r\n\r\nNow, it was this condition, essential to the maintenance of\r\nCastlereagh's Balance of Power, which completely broke down during the\r\ncourse of the nineteenth century. Like most of the vital processes in\r\nhistory, the change was gradual and unobtrusive, and its significance\r\nescaped the notice of politicians, journalists, and even historians. Men\r\nwent on repeating Castlereagh's phrases about the Balance of Power\r\nwithout perceiving that the circumstances, which alone had given it\r\nreality, had entirely altered. The individual independence and automatic\r\naction of the Great Powers in checking the growing ambitions and\r\nstrength of particular States were impaired, if not destroyed, by\r\nseparate Alliances, which formed units into groups for the purposes of\r\nwar and foreign policy, and broke up the unity of the European system,\r\njust as a similar tendency threatens to break up the League of Nations.\r\nThere was a good deal of shifting about in temporary alliances which\r\nthere is no need to recount; but the ultimate upshot was the severance\r\nof Europe into the two great groups with which we are all familiar, the\r\nTriple Alliance of Germany, Austria, and Italy on one side, and the\r\nTriple Entente between Russia, France, and Great Britain on the other.\r\nThe multiple Balance of Power was thus changed into a simple balance\r\nbetween two vast aggregations of force, and nothing remained outside to\r\nhold the balance, except the United States, which had apparently\r\nforsworn by the Monroe Doctrine the function of keeping it even.\r\n\r\nAnd yet men continued to speak of the Balance of Power as though there\r\nhad been no change, and as though Castlereagh's ideas were as applicable\r\nto the novel situation as they had been to the old! That illustrates\r\nthe tyranny of phrases. Cynics have said that language is used to\r\nconceal our thoughts. It is difficult to resist the conclusion that\r\nphrases are used to save us the trouble of thinking. We are always\r\ngiving things labels in order to put them away in their appropriate\r\npigeon-holes, and then we talk about the labels without thinking about\r\nthem, and often forgetting (if we ever knew) the things for which they\r\nstand. So we Pelmanised the Balance of Power, and continued to use the\r\nphrase without in the least troubling to ask what it means. When I asked\r\nat the Foreign Office whether diplomatists meant by the Balance of Power\r\nthe sort of simple balance between two great alliances like the Triple\r\nAlliance and the Triple Entente, I was told \"yes\"; and there was some\r\nsurprise--since the tradition of Castlereagh is strong in the\r\nservice--when I pointed out that that was an entirely different balance\r\nfrom that of which Castlereagh had approved as a guarantee of peace. You\r\nremember the Cheshire cat in _Alice in Wonderland_--an excellent\r\ntext-book for students of politics--and how the cat gradually faded away\r\nleaving only its grin behind it to perplex and puzzle the observer. So\r\nthe body and the substance of Castlereagh's Balance of Power passed\r\naway, and still men talk of the grin and look to the phrase to save them\r\nfrom war. Whether to call them visionaries or the blind, I do not know.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCHIEVOUS HALLUCINATION\r\n\r\nIn either case, it is a mischievous hallucination; for the simple\r\nBalance of Power between two great combinations is not only no guarantee\r\nof peace, but the great begetter of fear, of the race for armaments, and\r\nof war. Consider for a moment. If you want a balance, you want to have\r\nit perfect. What is a perfect balance between two opposing weights or\r\nforces? It is one which the addition of a feather-weight to either scale\r\nwill at once and completely upset. Now what will that equipoise produce?\r\nThe ease with which the balance may be destroyed will produce either on\r\none side the temptation to upset it, and on the other fear lest it be\r\nupset, or fear on both sides at once. What indeed was it but this even\r\nbalance and consequent fear which produced the race for armaments? And\r\nwhat does the race for armaments result in but in war? If we want war,\r\nwe need only aim at a Balance of Power, and it will do the rest. So far\r\nfrom being a guarantee of peace, the Balance of Power is a sovereign\r\nspecific for precipitating war.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are arguments for a Balance of Power. Plenty of them,\r\nalas! though they are not often avowed. It produces other things than\r\nwar. For one thing, it makes fortunes for munition firms. For another,\r\nit provides careers for those who have a taste for fighting or for\r\nmilitary pomp. Thirdly, in order to maintain armies and navies and\r\narmaments, it keeps up taxation and diverts money from social,\r\neducational, and other reforms which some people want to postpone.\r\nFourthly, it gratifies those who believe that force is the ultimate\r\nsanction of order, and, by necessitating the maintenance of large forces\r\nfor defensive purposes, incidentally provides means for dealing with\r\ndomestic discontent. Fifthly, it panders to those who talk of prestige\r\nand think that prestige depends upon the size of a nation's armaments.\r\nFor the sake of these things many would be willing to take the risk of\r\nwar which the Balance of Power involves. But most of those who use the\r\nphrase are unconscious of these motives, and use it as they use many\r\nanother phrase, simply because they know not what it means. For,\r\nassuredly, no sane person who had examined the Balance of Power, as it\r\nexisted before the war, could ever advocate it as a means of peace.\r\n\r\nIndeed, whenever there has been the prospect of a practical Balance of\r\nPower, its votaries have shown by their action that they knew their\r\ncreed was nonsense. The late war, for instance, might have been ended in\r\n1916 on the basis of a Balance of Power. There were a few who believed\r\nthat that was the best solution; but they were not our latter-day\r\nbelievers in the Balance of Power. Their cry was all for a fight to a\r\nfinish and a total destruction of the Balance of Power by an\r\noverwhelming victory for the Allies, and their one regret is that a\r\nfinal blow by Marshal Foch did not destroy the last vestige of a German\r\narmy. What is the point of expressing belief in the Balance of Power\r\nwhen you indignantly repudiate your own doctrine on every occasion on\r\nwhich you might be able to give it effect? And what is the point of the\r\npresent advocacy of the Balance of Power by those who think themselves\r\nneither visionaries nor blind? Do they wish to restore the military\r\nstrength of Germany and of Russia and to see an Alliance between them\r\nconfronting a Franco-British union, compelled thereby to be militarist\r\ntoo? Is it really that they wish to be militarists and that the League\r\nof Nations, with its promise of peace, retrenchment, and reform, is to\r\nthem a greater evil than the Balance of Power?\r\n\r\n\r\nWHERE THE LINE IS DRAWN\r\n\r\nThere is yet another fatal objection to the Balance of Power due to the\r\nchange in circumstances since the days of Castlereagh. He could afford\r\nto think only of Europe, but we have to think of the world; and if our\r\nspecific has any value it must be of world-wide application. We cannot\r\nproclaim the virtues of the Balance of Power and then propose to limit\r\nit to the land or to any particular continent. Now, did our believers in\r\nthe Balance of Power ever wish to see power balanced anywhere else than\r\non the continent of Europe? That, if we studied history in any other\r\nlanguage than our own, we should know was the gibe which other peoples\r\nflung at our addiction to the Balance of Power. We wanted, they said, to\r\nsee a Balance of Power on the continent of Europe, to see one half of\r\nEurope equally matched against the other, because the more anxiously\r\nContinental States were absorbed in maintaining their Balance of Power,\r\nthe keener would be their competition for our favour, and the freer\r\nwould be our hands to do what we liked in the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nWas that a baseless slander? Let us test it with a question or two. Did\r\nwe ever want a Balance of Power at sea? British supremacy, with a\r\ntwo-to-one or at least a sixteen-to-ten standard was, I fancy, our\r\nminimum requirement. Is British supremacy what we mean by a Balance of\r\nPower? Again, did we ever desire a Balance of Power in Africa, America,\r\nor Asia? We may have talked of it sometimes, but only when we were the\r\nweaker party and feared that another might claim in those continents the\r\nsort of Balance of Power we claimed on the sea. We never spoke of the\r\nBalance of Power in the interests of any nation except ourselves and an\r\noccasional ally. We cannot speak in those terms to-day. If we demand a\r\nBalance of Power on land, we must expect others to claim it at sea; if\r\nwe urge it on Europe as a means of peace, we cannot object if others\r\nturn our own argument against us in other quarters of the globe; and\r\nwherever you have a Balance of Power you will have a race for armaments\r\nand the fear of war.\r\n\r\nThe Balance of Power is, in fact, becoming as obsolete as the Monopoly\r\nof Power enjoyed by the Roman Empire. It is a bankrupt policy which went\r\ninto liquidation in 1914, and the high court of public opinion demands a\r\nreconstruction. The principle of that reconstruction was stated by\r\nPresident Wilson, a great seer whose ultimate fame will survive the\r\nobloquy in which he has been involved by the exigencies of American\r\nparty-politics and the short-sightedness of public opinion in Europe. We\r\nwant, he said, a Community of Power, and its organ must be the League of\r\nNations. Nations must begin to co-operate and cease to counteract.\r\n\r\nI am not advocating the League of Nations except in the limited way of\r\nattempting to show that the Balance of Power is impossible as an\r\nalternative unless you can re-create the conditions of a century ago,\r\nrestore the individual independence of a number of fairly equal Powers,\r\nand guarantee the commonwealth of nations against privy conspiracy and\r\nsedition in the form of separate groups and alliances. But there is one\r\nsupreme advantage in a Community of Power, provided it remains a\r\nreality, and that is that it need never be used. Its mere existence\r\nwould be sufficient to ensure the peace; for no rebel State would care\r\nto challenge the inevitable defeat and retribution which a Community of\r\nPower could inflict. It has even been urged, and I believe it myself,\r\nthat Germany would never have invaded Belgium had she been sure that\r\nGreat Britain, and still less had she thought that America, would\r\nintervene. It was the Balance of Power that provoked the war, and it was\r\nthe absence of a Community of Power which made it possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nBASIS OF SECURITY\r\n\r\nBut no one who thinks that power--whether a Monopoly, a Balance, or even\r\na Community of Power is the ultimate guardian angel of our peace, has\r\nthe root of the matter in him. Men, said Burke, are not governed\r\nprimarily by laws, still less by force; and behind all power stands\r\nopinion. To believe in public opinion rather than in might excludes the\r\nbeliever from the regular forces of militarism and condemns him as a\r\nvisionary and blind. For advocates of the Balance of Power bear a\r\nstriking resemblance to the Potsdam school; and even so moderate a\r\nGerman as the late Dr. Rathenau declared in his unregenerate days before\r\nthe war that Germans were not in the habit of reckoning with public\r\nopinion. Nevertheless, there is a frontier in the world which for a\r\ncentury and more has enjoyed a security which all the armaments of\r\nPrussian militarism could not give the German Fatherland; and the\r\nabsolute security of that frontier rests not upon a monopoly nor a\r\ncommunity, still less upon a balance of power, but on the opinion held\r\non both sides of that frontier that all power is irrational and futile\r\nas a guarantee of peace between civilised or Christian people.\r\n\r\nLet us look at that frontier for a moment. It is in its way the most\r\nwonderful thing on earth, and it holds a light to lighten the nations\r\nand to guide our feet into the way of peace. It runs, of course, between\r\nthe Dominion of Canada and the United States of America across the great\r\nlakes and three thousand miles of prairie; and from the military and\r\nstrategic point of view it is probably the worst frontier in the world.\r\nWhy then is it secure? Is it because of any monopoly or community or\r\nbalance of power? Is it because the United States and the British\r\nEmpire are under a common government, or because there is along that\r\nfrontier a nicely-balanced distribution of military strength? No, it is\r\nsecure, not in spite of the absence of force, but because of the absence\r\nof force; and if you want to destroy the peace of that frontier from end\r\nto end, all you need to do is to send a regiment to protect it, launch a\r\n_Dreadnought_ on those lakes, and establish a balance of power. For\r\nevery regiment or warship on one side will produce a regiment or warship\r\non the other; and then your race for armaments will begin, and the\r\npoison will spread until the whole of America becomes like Europe, an\r\narmed camp of victims to the theory of strategic frontiers and of the\r\nBalance of Power.\r\n\r\nThose theories, their application, and their consequences recently cost\r\nthe world thirty million casualties and thousands of millions of pounds\r\nwithin a brief five years, and yet left the frontiers of Europe less\r\nsecure than they were before. Three thousand miles of frontier in North\r\nAmerica have in more than a hundred years cost us hardly a life, or a\r\nlimb, or a penny. As we put those details side by side we realise\r\n_quantula regitur mundus sapientia_--with how little wisdom do men rule\r\nthe world. Yet the truth was told us long ago that he that ruleth his\r\nspirit is better than he that taketh a city, and we might have learnt by\r\nour experience of the peace that the only conquest that really pays is\r\nthe conquest of oneself.\r\n\r\nThe real peace of that North American frontier is due to no conquest of\r\nAmericans by Canadians or of Canadians by Americans, but to their\r\nconquest of themselves and of that foolish pride of \"heathen folk who\r\nput their trust in reeking tube and iron shard.\" Let us face the facts,\r\nwhatever the visionaries and the blind may say. So be it. The war is a\r\nfact, and so is the desolation it has wrought. But that Anglo-American\r\nfrontier is also a fact, and so is that century of peace which happily\r\nfollowed upon the resolution to depend for the defence of that frontier\r\non moral restraint instead of on military force. Verily, peace hath her\r\nvictories not less renowned than those of war.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ALTERNATIVE\r\n\r\nWe have, indeed, to face the facts, and the facts about the Balance of\r\nPower must dominate our deliberations and determine the fate of our\r\nprogrammes. There may be no more war for a generation, but there can be\r\nno peace with a Balance of Power. There can be nothing better than an\r\narmed truce; and an armed truce, with super-dreadnoughts costing from\r\nfour to eight times what they did before the war, is fatal to any\r\nprogramme of retrenchment and reform. We are weighted enough in all\r\nconscience with the debt of that war without the burden of preparation\r\nfor another; and a Balance of Power involves a progressive increase in\r\npreparations for war.\r\n\r\nUnless we can exorcise fear, we are doomed to repeat the sisyphean\r\ncycles of the past and painfully roll our programmes up the hill, only\r\nto see them dashed to the bottom, before we get to the top, by the\r\ncatastrophe of war. Fear is fatal to freedom; it is fear which alone\r\ngives militarism its strength, compels nations to spend on armaments\r\nwhat they fain would devote to social reform, drives them into secret\r\ndiplomacy and unnatural alliances, and leads them to deny their just\r\nliberties to subject populations. Fear is the root of reaction as faith\r\nis the parent of progress; and the incarnation of international fear is\r\nthe Balance of Power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL DISARMAMENT\r\n\r\nBY MAJOR-GENERAL SIR FREDERICK MAURICE, K.C.M.G., C.B.\r\n\r\nDirector of Military Operations--Imperial General Staff, 1915-16.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Frederick Maurice said:--This problem of the reduction of armaments\r\nis one of the most urgent of the international and national problems of\r\nthe day. It is urgent in its economic aspect, urgent also as regards its\r\nrelation to the future peace of the world. The urgency of its economic\r\naspect was proclaimed two years ago at the Brussels conference of\r\nfinanciers assembled by the League of Nations. These experts said quite\r\nplainly and definitely that, so far as they could see, the salvation of\r\nEurope from bankruptcy depended upon the immediate diminution of the\r\ncrushing burden of expenditure upon arms. That was two years ago. Linked\r\nup with this question is the whole question of the economic\r\nreconstruction of Europe. Linked up with it also is that deep and grave\r\nproblem of reparations. It is no longer the case to-day, if it has ever\r\nbeen the case since the war, which I doubt, that sober opinion in France\r\nconsiders it necessary for France to have large military forces in order\r\nto protect her from German aggression in the near future. For the past\r\ntwo years, however, it has been the custom of those who live upon alarms\r\nto produce the German menace. There is a great body of opinion in\r\nFrance at this moment which feels that unless France is able to put the\r\npistol to Germany's head, it will never be able to get a penny out of\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nYou have the further connection of the attitude of America to the\r\nproblem. America said, officially through Mr. Hoover and unofficially\r\nthrough a number of her leading financiers, that she was not ready to\r\ncome forward and take her share in the economic restoration of Europe so\r\nlong as Europe is squandering its resources upon arms. The connection is\r\nquite definitely and explicitly recognised in the Covenant of the League\r\nof Nations. Article 8 begins: \"The principles of the League recognise\r\nthat the maintenance of peace requires reduction of national armaments\r\nto the lowest point consistent with national safety, and the enforcement\r\nby common action of international obligations.\" These words were\r\npromulgated in 1919. Personally, I find myself in complete agreement\r\nwith what Lord Robert Cecil said this morning, and what Lord Grey said a\r\nfew days ago at Newcastle, that one of the prime causes of the war was\r\nPrussian militarism. By that I mean the influence of that tremendous\r\nmilitary machine, which had been built up through years of labour in\r\nGermany, in moulding the public opinion of that country.\r\n\r\n\r\nA GROUP OF NEW ARMIES\r\n\r\nWell, how do we stand in regard to that to-day? We stand to-day in the\r\nposition that the armaments of Germany, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, have\r\nall been compulsorily drastically reduced, but in their place you have a\r\nwhole group of new armies. You have armies to-day which did not exist\r\nbefore the war, in Finland, Esthonia, Poland, Lithuania, and\r\nCzecho-Slovakia, and the sum total is that at this moment there are more\r\narmed men in time of peace in Europe than in 1913. Is there no danger\r\nthat this machine will mould the minds of some other peoples, just as\r\nthe German machine moulded the minds of the Germans? This is the\r\nposition as regards the peace establishments of Europe to-day in their\r\nrelation to the future peace of the world. What about the economic\r\nposition? I have mentioned that certain Powers have had their forces\r\ndrastically reduced, and that has brought with it a drastic reduction of\r\nexpenditure, but I have before me the naval, military, and air force\r\nestimates of the eight principal Powers in Europe, leaving out Germany,\r\nAustria, and Bulgaria, whose forces have been compulsorily reduced.\r\n\r\nAt the economic conference of financiers in Brussels in 1920 it was\r\nmentioned with horror that 20 per cent. of the income of Europe was then\r\nbeing devoted to arms. I find that to-day 25 per cent. of the total\r\nincome of these eight Powers is devoted to arms. I find, further, that\r\nof these eight Powers who have budgeted for a smaller service, only\r\none--Yugo-Slavia--has managed to balance her budget, and the others have\r\nlarge deficits which are many times covered by their expenditure on\r\narms. And this is going on at a time when all these eight nations are\r\ntaxed almost up to their limit, when the whole of their industries are\r\nsuffering in consequence, and when the danger of bankruptcy, which\r\nhorrified the financiers in 1920, is even more imminent.\r\n\r\nThat being the case, what has been done in the last few years to remedy\r\nthis matter, and why is more not being done? As you all know, this\r\nquestion is in the forefront of the programme of the League of Nations.\r\nAnd the League began to deal with it at once. Lord Robert Cecil will\r\nagree with me that the framers of the Covenant, of which he is one of\r\nthe chief, could not foresee everything, and they did not foresee at the\r\ntime the Covenant was framed, that machinery would be required to deal\r\nwith this extraordinarily complex question of armaments. They created an\r\norganisation then called a Permanent Military Command, still in\r\nexistence, to advise the Council of the League on all military matters.\r\nBut when these gentlemen got to work upon such questions as reduction of\r\narmaments, they at once found themselves dealing with matters entirely\r\nbeyond their competence, because into this problem enter problems of\r\nhigh politics and finance, and a thousand other questions of which\r\nsoldiers, sailors, and airmen know nothing whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEAGUE'S COMMISSION\r\n\r\nThe first step was to remedy an oversight in the machinery, and that was\r\ndone at the first meeting of the Assembly. The first meeting of the\r\nAssembly created a temporary mixed commission on armaments, which was\r\ncomposed of persons of recognised competence in political, social, and\r\neconomic matters. It consisted of six members of the old Permanent\r\nCommission, and in addition a number of statesmen, employers, and\r\nrepresentatives of labour. This body started to tackle this grave\r\nquestion. Before it began the first Assembly of the League had suggested\r\none line of approach--that there should be an agreement to limit\r\nexpenditure; that an attempt should be made to limit armaments by\r\nlimiting budgets; and nations were asked to agree that they would not\r\nexceed in the two years following the acceptance of the resolution the\r\nbudgeted expenditure on armaments of the current year.\r\n\r\nThat proposal did not meet with great success. It was turned down by\r\nseven Powers, notably by France and Spain. On the whole, I think France\r\nand Spain and the other Powers had some reason on their side, because it\r\nis not possible to approach this problem solely from the financial\r\nstandpoint. You cannot get a financial common denominator and apply it\r\nto armaments. The varying costs of a soldier in Europe and in Japan have\r\nno relation to each other. The cost of a voluntary soldier in Great\r\nBritain has no relation to the cost of a conscript on the Continent.\r\nTherefore, that line of approach, when applied too broadly, is not\r\nfruitful. I think myself it is quite possible that you may be able to\r\napply financial limitations to the question of material, the\r\nconstruction of guns and other weapons of war, because the cost of these\r\nthings in foreign countries tends much more to a common level. I think\r\nthis is a possible line of approach, but to try to make a reduction of\r\narmaments by reducing budgets on a wholesale scale I do not think will\r\nlead us anywhere at all. I may safely say that for the present that line\r\nof approach has been abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe Temporary Mixed Commission got to work, and in its first year,\r\nfrankly, I cannot say it did very much. It concerned itself very largely\r\nwith the accumulation of information and the collection of statistics,\r\nbearing rather the same relation to world problems as a Royal Commission\r\ndoes to our domestic problems. By the time the second Assembly met\r\npractically nothing had been done by the Commission. But other people\r\nhad been at work, and our own League of Nations Union had put forward a\r\nproposal--a line of approach, rather, I would say, to this\r\nproblem--which I for one think is extremely useful. It began by\r\ninquiring as to what armaments were for, which after all is a useful way\r\nof beginning, and the inquiry came to the conclusion that nations\r\nrequired them for three purposes--to maintain internal order; as a last\r\nresort for the enforcement of law and order; and to protect overseas\r\npossessions. After these purposes were served there was a large residuum\r\nleft. That residuum could only be required for one purpose--to protect\r\nthe country in question from foreign aggression. When you had gone thus\r\nfar in your reasoning, you had obviously got into the zone where\r\nbargaining becomes possible, because it is obvious that by agreement you\r\ncan get the force by which a nation is liable to become reduced. That\r\nline of approach received the general blessing at the second Assembly of\r\nthe League of Nations. Things began to move, primarily because the\r\nDominion of South Africa took a keen interest in this problem of the\r\nreduction of armaments, and South Africa appointed Lord Robert Cecil as\r\nits representative, and instructed him to press the matter on, and he\r\ndid. The Assembly definitely instructed this temporary mixed Commission\r\nthat by the time the third Assembly met plans should be prepared and\r\nconcrete proposals put on paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON\r\n\r\nSoon after that came the Washington Conference--a great landmark in the\r\nhistory of this problem. For reasons I need not go into in detail, the\r\nnaval problem is very much easier than the military or air problem. You\r\nhave as the nucleus of naval forces something quite definite and\r\nprecise--the battleship--and it also happens that that particular unit\r\nis extremely costly, and takes a long time to build, and no man has yet\r\never succeeded in concealing the existence of a battleship. There you\r\nhad three important points--a large and important unit in the possession\r\nof everybody concerned, very costly, so that by reducing it you make\r\ngreat reductions in expenditure. There was no possibility of avoiding an\r\nagreement about the construction of battleships, and it is to these\r\nfacts mainly that the happy results of the Washington Conference were\r\ndue.\r\n\r\nBut for the furtherance of the problem the point is this. The Washington\r\nConference definitely established the principle of reduction of\r\narmaments on a great ratio. The ratio for battleships between Great\r\nBritain, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy, was settled as to\r\n5, 5, 3, and 1.75. They all agreed on a definite ratio. All agreed to\r\nscrap a certain number of ships, to bring their tonnage down to a\r\ncertain figure, and by doing that relatively they were left in the same\r\nposition as before, with this advantage--that they at once obtained an\r\nenormous reduction in expenditure on armaments.\r\n\r\nThat opened up a new line of approach for the attack on this problem\r\nfrom the military and air standpoint. And the next development took\r\nplace in February this year at the meeting of the Temporary Mixed\r\nCommission on armaments, when the Esher proposals were presented. There\r\nhas been a great deal of talk about the Esher proposals, and I am glad\r\nof it, because the one thing wanted in this question is public interest.\r\nThe Esher proposals were an endeavour to apply to land armaments this\r\nprinciple of reduction on a great ratio. And the line taken was this. It\r\nwas necessary to find some unit in land armaments which corresponded\r\nwith the battleships, and the unit selected by Lord Esher was the\r\n300,000 regular soldiers of the peace armies in France, England, and\r\nSpain. It was selected because it happened to be the number to which the\r\nAustrian army was reduced by treaty, and with that unit he proposed a\r\nratio for the armies of Europe, which would leave everybody relatively\r\nin much the same position as before, but would obtain an immediate\r\nreduction in numbers of standing armies and a great reduction of\r\nexpenditure.\r\n\r\nThis proposal was subjected to a great deal of criticism, and I am sorry\r\nto say nine-tenths of the criticism appears to emanate from persons who\r\nhave never read the proposal at all. It is a proposal which lends itself\r\nto a great deal of criticism, and the most effective criticism which\r\ncould have been applied at the time it was presented was that it put the\r\ncart before the horse, and approached the problem from the wrong\r\ndirection, for, as Lord Robert Cecil has said here this morning, what\r\nnations require is security. Some of them have clear ideas as to the way\r\nof obtaining it, but they all want it, and before you can expect people\r\nto reduce their armaments, which are, after all, maintained mainly for\r\nthe purpose of providing security, you must give them something that\r\nwill take the place of armaments.\r\n\r\n\r\nA GENERAL DEFENSIVE PACT\r\n\r\nIn June an important development took place in this Temporary\r\nCommission. It was increased by the addition of a number of statesmen,\r\nand, amongst others, of men who ought to have been on it long ago. Lord\r\nRobert Cecil was added, and he at once proceeded to remedy what was a\r\nreal difficulty in Lord Esher's proposals. He put forward a plan for\r\nproviding security in the form, as the Assembly of the League had asked,\r\nof a definite written proposal--really a brief treaty. The purport of\r\nthat treaty is included in the form of resolutions, which are roughly as\r\nfollows:--No scheme for the reduction of armaments can be effective\r\nunless it is general; that in the present state of the world no\r\nGovernment can accept the responsibility for a serious reduction of\r\narmaments unless it is given some other equally satisfactory guarantee\r\nof the safety of its country; such guarantee can only be found in a\r\ngeneral defensive agreement of all the countries concerned, binding them\r\nall to come to the assistance of any one of them if attacked.\r\n\r\nA general defensive pact, with a proviso! It is obviously unreasonable\r\nto expect the States of the American continent to be ready to come over\r\nat any moment to help in Europe. It is obviously unreasonable to expect\r\nthe States of Europe to bind themselves to come and fight in Asia.\r\nTherefore, there was this proviso added that an obligation to come to\r\nthe assistance of the attacked country should be limited to those\r\ncountries which belonged to the same quarter of the globe. Thus, you\r\nsee, you are getting the obligation of the League into regional\r\napplication. Personally my own conviction is that this is the line upon\r\nwhich many of the functions of the League will develop.\r\n\r\nThe main point of the situation as it is to-day is that you have got a\r\ncommittee working out in detail a general pact, which when it is\r\nformulated will be far more complete and satisfactory than the very\r\ngeneral and vague Clause 10 of the Covenant. We have reached the\r\nposition when practical proposals are beginning to emerge. What more is\r\nwanted? How can we help on this work? You will have gathered from what I\r\nsaid that it is my own conviction that with this problem of reduction of\r\narmaments is so closely linked up the problem of economic reconstruction\r\nand reparations that the whole ought to be taken together. I believe one\r\nof the reasons why so little progress has been made is that the economic\r\nproblems have been entrusted, with the blessing of our and other\r\nGovernments, to perambulating conferences, while the disarmament problem\r\nhas been left solely to the League of Nations. I believe if you could\r\nget the whole of these problems considered by one authority--and there\r\nis one obvious authority--progress would be far more rapid.\r\n\r\nThere is another matter which concerns us as citizens--the attitude of\r\nour own Government to this question. I was delighted to see recently an\r\nannouncement made by a Minister in the House of Commons that the\r\nGovernment was seriously in favour of a reduction of armaments on a\r\ngreat ratio. I was delighted to read the other day a speech, to which\r\nreference has already been made, by the Prime Minister. We have had a\r\ngreat many words on this question. The time has come for action, and\r\nquite frankly the action of our Government in the past two years with\r\nregard to this question has been neutral, and not always one of\r\nbenevolent neutrality. Our official representatives at Geneva have been\r\nvery careful to stress the difficulties, but up to the present I am\r\nunaware that our Government has ever placed its immense resources as\r\nregards information at the disposal of the one Englishman who has been\r\nstriving with all his power and knowledge to get a definite solution. I\r\nbelieve there is going to be a change; I hope so. In any case, the best\r\nthing we can do is to see that it is changed, and that Lord Robert Cecil\r\nis not left to fight a lone battle.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE APPEAL TO PUBLIC OPINION\r\n\r\nThere is something more. There is something wanted from each of us.\r\nPersonally, I am convinced myself that this problem is soluble on the\r\nlines by which it is now being approached. I speak to you as a\r\nprofessional who has given some study to the subject. I am convinced\r\nthat on the lines of a general pact as opposed to the particular pact, a\r\ngeneral defensive agreement as opposed to separate alliances, followed\r\nby reduction on a great ratio, the practicability of which has been\r\nproved at Washington, a solution can be reached. Given goodwill--that is\r\nthe point. At the last Assembly of the League of Nations a report was\r\npresented by the Commission, of which Lord Robert Cecil was a member,\r\nand it wound up with these words: \"Finally, the committee recognises\r\nthat a policy of disarmament, to be successful, requires the support of\r\nthe population of the world. Limitation of armaments will never be\r\nimposed by Governments on peoples, but it may be imposed by peoples on\r\nGovernments.\" That is absolutely true. How are we going to apply it?\r\nFrankly, myself, I do not see that there is a great deal of value to be\r\ngot by demonstrations which demand no more war. I have every sympathy\r\nwith their object, but we have got to the stage when we want to get\r\nbeyond words to practical resolutions. We want definite concrete\r\nproposals, and you won't get these merely by demonstrations. They are\r\nquite good in their way, but they are not enough. What you want in this\r\nmatter is an informed public opinion which sees what is practical and\r\ninsists on having it.\r\n\r\nI am speaking to you as one who for a great many years believed\r\nabsolutely that preparation for war was the means of securing peace. In\r\n1919--when I had a little time to look round, to study the causes of the\r\nwar and the events of the war--I changed my opinion. I then came quite\r\ndefinitely to the conclusion that preparation for war, carried to the\r\npoint to which it had been carried in 1914, was a direct cause of war. I\r\nhad to find another path, and I found it in 1919. Lord Robert may\r\npossibly remember that in the early days of the Peace Conference I came\r\nto him and made my confession of faith, and I promised to give him what\r\nlittle help I could. I have tried to keep my promise, and I believe this\r\nvital problem, upon which not only the economic reconstruction of Europe\r\nand the future peace of the world, but also social development at home\r\ndepend, can be solved provided you will recognise that the problem is\r\nvery complex; that there is fear to be overcome; that you are content\r\nwith what is practical from day to day, and accept each practical step\r\nprovided it leads forward to the desired goal. I therefore most\r\nearnestly trust that the Liberal party will take this question up, and\r\ntranslate it into practical politics. For that is what is required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPARATIONS AND INTER-ALLIED DEBT\r\n\r\nBY JOHN MAYNARD KEYNES\r\n\r\nM.A., C.B.; Fellow of King's College, Cambridge; Editor of _Economic\r\nJournal_ since 1912; principal representative of the Treasury at the\r\nParis Peace Conference, and Deputy for the Chancellor of the Exchequer\r\non the Supreme Economic Council, Jan.-June, 1919.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Keynes said:--I do not complain of Lord Balfour's Note, provided we\r\nassume, as I think we can, that it is our first move, and not our last.\r\nMany people seem to regard it as being really addressed to the United\r\nStates. I do not agree. Essentially it is addressed to France. It is a\r\nreply, and a very necessary reply, to the kites which M. Poincaré has\r\nbeen flying in _The Times_ and elsewhere, suggesting that this country\r\nshould sacrifice all its claims of every description in return\r\nfor--practically nothing at all, certainly not a permanent solution of\r\nthe general problem. The Note brings us back to the facts and to the\r\nproper starting-point for negotiations.\r\n\r\nIn this question of Reparations the position changes so fast that it may\r\nbe worth while for me to remind you just how the question stands at this\r\nmoment. There are in existence two inconsistent settlements, both of\r\nwhich still hold good in law. The first is the assessment of the\r\nReparation Commission, namely, 132 milliard gold marks. This is a\r\ncapital sum. The second is the London Settlement, which is not a capital\r\nsum at all, but a schedule of annual payments calculated according to a\r\nformula; but the capitalised value of these annual payments, worked out\r\non any reasonable hypothesis, comes to much less than the Reparation\r\nCommission's total, probably to not much more than a half.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BREAKDOWN OF GERMANY\r\n\r\nBut that is not the end of the story. While both the above settlements\r\nremain in force, the temporary régime under which Germany has been\r\npaying is different from, and much less than, either of them. By a\r\ndecision of last March Germany was to pay during 1922 £36,000,000 (gold)\r\nin cash, _plus_ deliveries in kind. The value of the latter cannot be\r\nexactly calculated, but, apart from coal, they do not amount to much,\r\nwith the result that the 1922 demands are probably between a third and a\r\nquarter of the London Settlement, and less than one-sixth of the\r\nReparation Commission's original total. It is under the weight of this\r\nreduced burden that Germany has now broken down, and the present crisis\r\nis due to her inability to continue these reduced instalments beyond the\r\npayment of July, 1922. In the long run the payments due during 1922\r\nshould be within Germany's capacity. But the insensate policy pursued by\r\nthe Allies for the last four years has so completely ruined her\r\nfinances, that for the time being she can pay nothing at all; and for a\r\nshorter or longer period it is certain that there is now no alternative\r\nto a moratorium.\r\n\r\nWhat, in these circumstances, does M. Poincaré propose? To judge from\r\nthe semi-official forecasts, he is prepared to cancel what are known as\r\nthe \"C\" Bonds, provided Great Britain lets France off the whole of her\r\ndebt and forgoes her own claims to Reparation. What are these \"C\" Bonds?\r\nThey are a part of the London Settlement of May, 1921, and, roughly\r\nspeaking, they may be said to represent the excess of the Reparation\r\nCommission's assessment over the capitalised value of the London\r\nSchedule of Payments, and a bit more. That is to say, they are pure\r\nwater. They mainly represent that part of the Reparation Commission's\r\ntotal assessment which will not be covered, even though the London\r\nSchedule of Payments is paid in full.\r\n\r\nIn offering the cancellation of these Bonds, therefore, M. Poincaré is\r\noffering exactly nothing. If Great Britain gave up her own claims to\r\nReparations, and the \"C\" Bonds were cancelled to the extent of France's\r\nindebtedness to us, France's claims against Germany would be actually\r\ngreater, even on paper, than they are now. For the demands under the\r\nLondon Settlement would be unabated, and France would be entitled to a\r\nlarger proportion of them. The offer is, therefore, derisory. And it\r\nseems to me to be little short of criminal on the part of _The Times_ to\r\nendeavour to trick the people of this country into such a settlement.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I do not think that at this juncture there is anything\r\nwhatever to be done except to grant a moratorium. It is out of the\r\nquestion that any figure, low enough to do Germany's credit any good\r\nnow, could be acceptable to M. Poincaré, in however moderate a mood he\r\nmay visit London next week. Apart from which, it is really impossible at\r\nthe present moment for any one to say how much Germany will be able to\r\npay in the long run. Let us content ourselves, therefore, with a\r\nmoratorium for the moment, and put off till next year the discussion of\r\na final settlement, when, with proper preparations beforehand, there\r\nought to be a grand Conference on the whole connected problem of\r\ninter-Governmental debt, with representatives of the United States\r\npresent, and possibly at Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ILLUSION OF A LOAN\r\n\r\nThe difficulties in the way of any immediate settlement now are so\r\nobvious that one might wonder why any one should be in favour of the\r\nattempt. The explanation lies in that popular illusion, with which it\r\nnow pleases the world to deceive itself--the International Loan. It is\r\nthought that if Germany's liability can now be settled once and for all,\r\nthe \"bankers\" will then lend her a huge sum of money by which she can\r\nanticipate her liabilities and satisfy the requirements of France.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the International Loan on a great scale is just as big an\r\nillusion as Reparations on a great scale. It will not happen. It cannot\r\nhappen. And it would make a most disastrous disturbance if it did\r\nhappen. The idea that the rest of the world is going to lend to\r\nGermany, for her to hand over to France, about 100 per cent. of their\r\nliquid savings--for that is what it amounts to--is utterly preposterous.\r\nAnd the sooner we get that into our heads the better. I am not quite\r\nclear for what sort of an amount the public imagine that the loan would\r\nbe, but I think the sums generally mentioned vary from £250,000,000 up\r\nto £500,000,000. The idea that any Government in the world, or all of\r\nthe Governments in the world in combination, let alone bankrupt Germany,\r\ncould at the present time raise this amount of new money (that is to\r\nsay, for other purposes than the funding or redemption of existing\r\nobligations) from investors in the world's Stock Exchanges is\r\nridiculous.\r\n\r\nThe highest figure which I have heard mentioned by a reliable authority\r\nis £100,000,000. Personally, I think even this much too high. It could\r\nonly be realised if subscriptions from special quarters, as, for\r\nexample, German hoards abroad, and German-Americans, were to provide the\r\ngreater part of it, which would only be the case if it were part of a\r\nsettlement which was of great and obvious advantage to Germany. A loan\r\nto Germany, on Germany's own credit, yielding, say, 8 to 10 per cent.,\r\nwould not in my opinion be an investor's proposition in any part of the\r\nworld, except on a most trifling scale. I do not mean that a larger\r\nanticipatory loan of a different character--issued, for example, in\r\nAllied countries with the guarantees of the Allied Government, the\r\nproceeds in each such country being handed over to the guaranteeing\r\nGovernment, so that no new money would pass--might not be possible. But\r\na loan of this kind is not at present in question.\r\n\r\nYet a loan of from £50,000,000 to £100,000,000--and I repeat that even\r\nthis figure is very optimistic except as the result of a settlement of a\r\nkind which engaged the active goodwill of individual Germans with\r\nforeign resources and of foreigners of German origin and\r\nsympathies--would only cover Germany's liabilities under the London\r\nSchedule for four to six months, and the temporarily reduced payments of\r\nlast March for little more than a year. And from such a loan, after\r\nmeeting Belgian priorities and Army of Occupation costs, there would not\r\nbe left any important sum for France.\r\n\r\nI see no possibility, therefore, of any final settlement with M.\r\nPoincaré in the immediate future. He has now reached the point of saying\r\nthat he is prepared to talk sense in return for an enormous bribe, and\r\nthat is some progress. But as no one is in a position to offer him the\r\nbribe, it is not much progress, and as the force of events will compel\r\nhim to talk sense sooner or later, even without a bribe, his bargaining\r\nposition is not strong. In the meantime he may make trouble. If so, it\r\ncan't be helped. But it will do him no good, and may even help to bring\r\nnearer the inevitable day of disillusion. I may add that for France to\r\nagree to a short moratorium is not a great sacrifice since, on account\r\nof the Belgian priority and other items, the amount of cash to which\r\nFrance will be entitled in the near future, even if the payments fixed\r\nlast March were to be paid in full, is quite trifling.\r\n\r\n\r\nA POLICY FOR THE LIBERAL PARTY\r\n\r\nSo much for the immediate situation and the politics of the case. If we\r\nlook forward a little, I venture to think that there is a clear, simple,\r\nand practical policy for the Liberal Party to adopt and to persist in.\r\nBoth M. Poincaré and Mr. Lloyd George have their hands tied by their\r\npast utterances. Mr. Lloyd George's part in the matter of Reparations is\r\nthe most discreditable episode in his career. It is not easy for him,\r\nwhose hands are not clean in the matter, to give us a clean settlement.\r\nI say this although his present intentions appear to be reasonable. All\r\nthe more reason why others should pronounce and persist in a clear and\r\ndecided policy. I was disappointed, if I may say so, in what Lord Grey\r\nhad to say about this at Newcastle last week. He said many wise things,\r\nbut not a word of constructive policy which could get any one an inch\r\nfurther forward. He seemed to think that all that was necessary was to\r\ntalk to the French sympathetically and to put our trust in international\r\nbankers. He puts a faith in an international loan as the means of\r\nsolution which I am sure is not justified. We must be much more concrete\r\nthan that, and we must be prepared to say unpleasant things as well as\r\npleasant ones.\r\n\r\nThe right solution, the solution that we are bound to come to in the\r\nend, is not complicated. We must abandon the claim for pensions and\r\nbring to an end the occupation of the Rhinelands. The Reparation\r\nCommission must be asked to divide their assessment into two parts--the\r\npart that represents pensions and separation allowances and the rest.\r\nAnd with the abandonment of the former the proportion due to France\r\nwould be correspondingly raised. If France would agree to this--which is\r\nin her interest, anyhow--and would terminate the occupation it would be\r\nright for us to forgive her (and our other Allies) all they owe us, and\r\nto accord a priority on all receipts in favour of the devastated areas.\r\nIf we could secure a real settlement by these sacrifices, I think we\r\nshould make them completely regardless of what the United States may say\r\nor do.\r\n\r\nIn declaring for this policy in the House of Commons yesterday, Mr.\r\nAsquith has given the Liberal Party a clear lead. I hope that they will\r\nmake it a principal plank in their platform. This is a just and\r\nhonourable settlement, satisfactory to sentiment and to expediency.\r\nThose who adopt it unequivocally will find that they have with them the\r\ntide and a favouring wind. But no one must suppose that, even with such\r\na settlement, any important part of Germany's payments can be\r\nanticipated by a loan. Any small loan that can be raised will be\r\nrequired for Germany herself, to put her on her legs again, and enable\r\nher to make the necessary annual payments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OUTLOOK FOR NATIONAL FINANCE\r\n\r\nBY SIR JOSIAH STAMP, K.B.E., D.SC.\r\n\r\nAssistant Secretary Board of Inland Revenue, 1916-19. Member of Royal\r\nCommission on Income Tax, 1919.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Josiah Stamp said:--In discussing the problem of National Finance we\r\nhave to decide which problem we mean, viz., the \"short period\" or the\r\n\"long period,\" for there are distinctly two issues. I can, perhaps,\r\nillustrate it best by the analogy of the household in which the chief\r\nearner or the head of the family has been stricken down by illness. It\r\nmay be that a heavy doctor's bill or surgeon's fee has to be met, and\r\nthat this represents a serious burden and involves the strictest economy\r\nfor a year or two; that all members of the household forgo some\r\nluxuries, and that there is a cessation of saving and perhaps a \"cut\"\r\ninto some past accumulations. But once these heroic measures have been\r\ntaken and the burden lifted, and the chief earner resumes his\r\noccupation, things proceed on the same scale and plan as before. It may\r\nbe, however, that the illness or operation permanently impairs his\r\nearning power, and that the changes which have to be made must be more\r\ndrastic and permanent. Then perhaps would come an alteration of the\r\nwhole ground plan of the life of that family, the removal to a smaller\r\nhouse with lower standing charges and a changed standard of living. What\r\nI call the \"short period\" problem involves a view only of the current\r\nyear and the immediate future for the purpose of ascertaining whether we\r\ncan make ends meet by temporary self-denial. What I term the \"long\r\ndistance\" problem involves an examination of the whole scale upon which\r\nour future outlay is conditioned for us.\r\n\r\nThe limit of further economies on the lines of the \"Geddes' cut\" that\r\ncan become effective in 1923, would seem to be some 50 or 60 millions,\r\nbecause every 10 per cent. in economy represents a much more drastic and\r\ndifficult task than the preceding, and it cuts more deeply into your\r\nessential national services. On the other side of the account one sees\r\nthe probable revenue diminish to an almost similar extent, having regard\r\nto the effect of reductions in the rate of tax and the depression in\r\ntrade, with a lower scale of profits, brought about by a lower price\r\nlevel, entering into the income-tax average. It looks as though 1923 may\r\njust pay its way, but if so, then, like the current year, it will make\r\nno contribution towards the reduction of the debt. So much for the\r\n\"short period.\" Our worst difficulties are really going to be\r\ndeep-seated ones.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWO PARTS OF A BUDGET\r\n\r\nNow a national budget may consist of two parts, one of which I will call\r\nthe \"responsive\" and the other the \"non-responsive\" portion. The\r\nresponsive portion is the part that may be expected to answer sooner or\r\nlater--later perhaps rather than sooner--to alterations in general\r\nconditions, and particularly to price alterations. If there is a very\r\nmarked difference in general price level, the salaries--both by the\r\naddition or remission of bonuses and the general alteration in scales\r\nfor new entrants--may be expected to alter, at any rate, in the same\r\ndirection, and that part of the expense which consists of the purchase\r\nof materials will also be responsive. The second, or non-responsive\r\npart, is the part that has a fixed expression in currency, and does not\r\nalter with changed conditions. This, for the most part, is the capital\r\nand interest for the public debt.\r\n\r\nNow the nature and gravity of the \"long distance\" problem is almost\r\nentirely a question of the proportions which these two sections bear to\r\neach other. If the non-responsive portion is a small percentage of the\r\ntotal the problem will not be important, but if it is larger, then the\r\nquestion must be faced seriously. Suppose, for example, that you have\r\nnow a total budget of 900 million pounds, and that, in the course of\r\ntime, all values are expressed at half the present currency figure.\r\nImagine that the national income in this instance is 3600 million\r\npounds. Then the burden, on a first approximation, is 25 per cent. Now,\r\nif the whole budget is responsive, we may find it ultimately at 450\r\nmillion pounds out of a national income of 1800 million pounds, _i.e._\r\nstill 25 per cent. But let the non-responsive portion be 400 million\r\npounds, then your total budget will be 650 million pounds out of a\r\nnational income of about 2000 million pounds, or 33-1/3 per cent., and\r\nevery alteration in prices--or what we call \"improvement\" in the cost of\r\nliving--becomes an extraordinarily serious matter as a burden upon new\r\nenterprise in the future.\r\n\r\nLet me give you a homely and familiar illustration. During the war the\r\nnation has borrowed something that is equivalent to a pair of boots.\r\nWhen the time comes for paying back the loan it repays something which\r\nis equivalent to two pairs or, possibly, even to three pairs. If the\r\ntotal number of boots produced has not altered, you will see what an\r\nincreasing \"pull\" this is upon production. There are, of course, two\r\nways in which this increasing pull--while a great boon to the person who\r\nis being repaid--must be an increased burden to the individual. Firstly,\r\nif the number of people making boots increases substantially, it may\r\nstill be only one pair of boots for the same volume of production, if\r\nthe burden is spread over that larger volume. Secondly, even supposing\r\nthat the number of individuals is not increased, if the arts of\r\nproduction have so improved that two pairs can be produced with the same\r\neffort as was formerly necessary for one, then the debt may be repaid by\r\nthem without the burden being actually heavier than before.\r\n\r\nNow, coming back to the general problem. The two ways in which the\r\nalteration in price level can be prevented from resulting in a heavier\r\nindividual burden than existed at the time when the transaction was\r\nbegun, are a large increase in the population with no lower average\r\nwealth, or a large increase in wealth with the same population--which\r\ninvolves a greatly increased dividend from our complex modern social\r\norganism with all its mechanical, financial, and other differentiated\r\nfunctions. Of course, some of the debt burden is responsive, so far as\r\nthe annual charge is concerned, on that part of the floating debt which\r\nis reborrowed continually at rates of interest which follow current\r\nmoney rates, but, even so, the burden of capital repayment remains. An\r\nopportunity occurs for putting sections of the debt upon a lower annual\r\ncharge basis whenever particular loans come to maturity, and there may\r\nbe some considerable relief in the annual charge in the course of time\r\nby this method.\r\n\r\nWhat are the prospects of the two methods that I have mentioned coming\r\nto our rescue in this \"long distance\" problem? It is a problem to which\r\nour present \"short distance\" contribution is, you will admit, a very\r\npoor one, for we have not so far really made any substantial\r\ncontribution from current revenue towards the repayment of the debt.\r\n\r\n\r\nA CENTURY OF THE NATIONAL DEBT\r\n\r\nHistorical surveys and parallels are notoriously risky, particularly\r\nwhere the conditions have no precedent. They ought, however, to be made,\r\nprovided that we keep our generalisations from them under careful\r\ncontrol. Now, after the Napoleonic wars we had a national debt somewhat\r\ncomparable in magnitude in its relation to the national wealth and\r\nincome with the present debt. What happened to that as a burden during\r\nthe 100 years just gone by? If it was alleviated, to what was the\r\nalleviation due? I would not burden you with a mass of figures, but I\r\nwould just give you one or two selected periods. You can find more\r\ndetails in my recent book on _Wealth and Taxable Capacity_. We had a\r\ntotal debt of--\r\n\r\n850 million pounds in 1817\r\n841    \"      \"    \"  1842\r\n836    \"      \"    \"  1857\r\n659    \"      \"    \"  1895\r\n800    \"      \"    \"  1903\r\n\r\nand before this last war it had been reduced to 707 million pounds. In\r\n1920, of course, it was over 8000 million pounds. Such incidents as the\r\nCrimean and the Boer wars added materially to the debt, but apart\r\ntherefrom you will see that there is no tremendous relief by way of\r\ncapital repayment to the original debt. Similarly, in a hundred years,\r\neven if we have no big wars, it is quite possible we may have additions\r\nto the national debt from smaller causes. Yet the volume of the debt per\r\nhead fell from £50 to £15.7, so you will see that the increasing\r\npopulation made an enormous difference. The real burden of the debt is\r\nof course felt mainly in its annual charge. I will take this, therefore,\r\nrather than the capital:--\r\n\r\nIn 1817 the charge was 32 million pounds\r\n\"  1842  \"    \"     \"  28    \"      \"\r\n\"  1857  \"    \"     \"  28.8  \"      \"\r\nIn 1895 the charge was 25 million pounds\r\n\"  1903  \"    \"     \"  27    \"      \"\r\n\"  1914  \"    \"     \"  24    \"      \"\r\n\r\nHere you will see that the reduction from 32 to 24 was 25 per cent. or a\r\nmuch greater reduction than the reduction of the _total_ capital debt,\r\nand this, of course, was contributed to by the lower rates of interest\r\nwhich had been brought about from time to time. When we take the annual\r\ncharge per head the fall is much more striking. In the hundred years it\r\ndecreased from 37s. to 10s. This, however, was a money reduction, and\r\nthe _real_ burden per head can only be judged after we have considered\r\nwhat the purchasing power of that money was. Now, the charge per head,\r\nreduced to a common basis of purchasing power, fell as follows:--\r\n\r\n        Index figure\r\n1817       260\r\n1842       242\r\n1857       191\r\n1895       210\r\n1914       118\r\n\r\nIn the year 1920 the charge per head was £7.16 and my purchasing power\r\nindex figure 629. You will see that the _real_ burden in commodities\r\nmoved down much less violently than the _money_ burden, and the relief\r\nwas not actually so great as it looks, because prices were far lower in\r\n1914 than they were early in the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that our debt is approximately ten times that of the\r\nlast century, let us ask ourselves the broad question: \"Can we look\r\nforward to nothing better than the reduction of our debt by 450\r\nmillions in thirty-seven years?\"\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth century was one long contest between two opposing forces.\r\nThe increase in the population, together with the power to make wealth,\r\nwere together enormously effective in decreasing the burden. Against\r\nthem was the ultimate tendency to lower prices, and the former of these\r\ntwo forces slowly won the day.\r\n\r\nI hesitate to say that we can expect anything at all comparable with the\r\nwonderful leap forward in productive power during the early Victorian\r\nera. I hope that in this I may prove to be wrong. Anyway I do not think\r\nthat in our lifetime we can expect these islands to double their\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAPITAL LEVY\r\n\r\nIf we cannot look forward to any great measure of relief through these\r\nchannels, to what then must we look? By far the most important\r\nalternative remedy which has been put to us is that of a Capital Levy;\r\nit has the enormous virtue that it would repay on one level of prices\r\nthe debts incurred at that level; in short, it would give back one pair\r\nof boots at once for every pair it has borrowed, instead of waiting and\r\nstretching out over future generations the burden of two pairs. It is so\r\nattractive that one cannot wonder there is a tendency to slur over its\r\nless obvious difficulties.\r\n\r\nAdvocates of this scheme fall into two camps, whom I would distinguish\r\nbroadly as the economist group and the Labour Party, and if you will\r\nexamine their advocacy carefully, you will see that they support it by\r\ntwo different sets of contentions, which are not easily reconciled. The\r\neconomists lay stress upon the fact that you not only pay off at a less\r\nonerous cost in real goods, but that it may, considered arithmetically\r\nor actuarially, be \"good business\" for a payer of high income-tax to\r\nmake an outright payment now and have a lighter income-tax in future.\r\nVery much of the economists' case rests indeed upon the argument drawn\r\nfrom the outright cut and the arithmetical relief. It will be seen that\r\nthis case depends upon two assumptions. The first is that the levy in\r\npractice as well as in theory is an outright cut, and the second, that\r\nit is not repeated, or rather that the income-tax is really effectively\r\nreduced. But if you look at the programme of the other supporters of the\r\nCapital Levy you will not find any convincing guarantees of its\r\nnon-repetition. I have not seen anywhere any scheme by which we can feel\r\npolitically insured against its repetition. You will find plenty of\r\nindication that some intend to have both the levy and a high tax as\r\nwell, the new money to be employed for other social purposes. The\r\narguments based upon arithmetical or actuarial superiority of the levy\r\nfor your pocket and for mine may therefore rather go by the board. But I\r\nam not going to discuss either the question of political guarantees or\r\nthe possible future socio-financial policy of the Labour Party. I will\r\nmerely ask you to consider whether the levy is likely to be in practice\r\nthe outright cut that is the basis of the chief and most valid\r\ncontention for it. Please understand that I am not attempting to sum up\r\nall the many reasons for and against this proposal, but only to deal\r\nwith the particular virtue claimed for it, bearing upon the increasing\r\nburden of the debt as prices decline.\r\n\r\nAny taxation scheme dependent upon general capital valuation, where the\r\namount to be paid is large--say larger than a year's revenue--falls, in\r\nmy judgment, into the second or third rate category of taxation\r\nexpedients. Whenever we are living in uncertain times, with no\r\nsteadiness of outlook, valuation of many classes of wealth is then a\r\ntremendous lottery, and collection--which takes time--may be no less so.\r\n\r\nThe fair face of the outright and graduated levy would be marred in many\r\nways. First, there are cases affected by valuation. The valuation of a\r\nfixed rate of interest on good security is easy enough. The valuation of\r\na field or a house in these days presents more difficulty, but is, of\r\ncourse, practicable. In practice, however, people do not own these\r\nthings outright. They have only an interest in them. This is where the\r\nrub comes. A very large part of the property in this country is held in\r\nlife interests, and on reversions or contingencies. It is not a question\r\nof saying that a given property is worth £10,000 and that it forms part\r\nof the fortune of Jones, who pays 40 per cent. duty. The point is that\r\nthe £10,000 is split between Jones and Robinson. Jones maybe has a life\r\ninterest in it, and Robinson a reversionary interest. You value Jones's\r\nwealth by his prospect of life on a life table, and Robinson has the\r\nbalance. But the life table does not indicate the actual likelihood of\r\nJones's life being fifteen years. It only represents the actuarial\r\naverage expectation of all the lives. This may be useful enough for\r\ninsurance dependent on the total experience, but it may be a shocking\r\ninjustice to the individual in taxation. Only some 10 per cent. of the\r\nJoneses will live for the allotted time, and for the rest your valuation\r\nand your tax will be dead wrong, either too much or too little. Jones\r\nwill be coming to you two years after he has paid, or rather his\r\nexecutors will come to you and say: \"We paid a tax based on Jones living\r\n15 years, and he has died; this ought, therefore, to be shifted to\r\nRobinson.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFICULTIES OF VALUATION\r\n\r\nPeople often say that a Capital Levy merely imagines everybody dying at\r\nthe same time. This parallel is wrong in degree when you are considering\r\nthe ease of paying duty or of changing the market values by a glut of\r\nshares, and it is still more wrong when you are thinking of ease of\r\nvaluation. When a man is dead, he is dead, and in estimating the death\r\nduty you have not to bother about how long he is going to live! But\r\nevery time you value a life interest and take a big slice of it for tax\r\nyou are probably doing a double injustice. The charge is incorrect for\r\ntwo taxpayers. On a flat rate of tax this difficulty might be made less,\r\nbut the essence of any effective levy is a progressive scale. Moreover,\r\nwhether you are right or wrong about Robinson's tax, he has nothing in\r\nhand with which to pay it. He has either to raise a mortgage on his\r\nexpectation (on which he pays _annual_ interest) or pay you by\r\ninstalments. So far as his burden is concerned, therefore, there is no\r\noutright cut. You will be getting an annual figure over nearly the whole\r\nclass of life interests and reversions. It is difficult to see how one\r\ncan escape making adjustments year after year for some time in the light\r\nof the ascertained facts, until the expiry of, say, nine or ten years\r\nhas reduced the disparities between the estimated valuations and the\r\nfacts of life to smaller proportions.\r\n\r\nNext come those valuations which depend for their accuracy upon being\r\nthe true mid-point of probabilities. A given mine may last for five\r\nyears in the view of some experts, or it may go on for fifteen in the\r\nview of others, and you may take a mid-point, say ten, and collect your\r\ntax, but, shortly after, this valuation turns out to be badly wrong,\r\n_though all your valuations in the aggregate are correct_. While the\r\nactive procedure of collecting the levy is in progress for a number of\r\nyears these assessments will simply shout at you for adjustment. There\r\nare other types of difficulty in assessment which involve annual\r\nadjustment, but you will appreciate most the necessity for care in the\r\ncollection. Enthusiastic advocates for the levy meet every hard case put\r\nforward where it is difficult to raise money, such as a private\r\nownership of an indivisible business, by saying: \"But that will be made\r\nin instalments, or the man can raise a mortgage.\" But the extent to\r\nwhich this is done robs the levy of all the virtues attaching to\r\noutrightness, for each instalment becomes, as the years roll on,\r\ndifferent in its real content upon a shifting price level, and every\r\npayment of interest on the mortgage--to say nothing of the ultimate\r\nrepayment of that mortgage--falls to be met as if reckoned upon the\r\noriginal currency level. Then those classes of wealth which are not\r\neasily realisable without putting down the market price also require\r\ntreatment by instalments, and those who wish to put forward a logical\r\nscheme also add a special charge upon salary-earners for some years--a\r\npseudo-capitalisation of their earning power.\r\n\r\nA really fair and practicable levy would certainly be honeycombed with\r\nannual adjustments and payments for some period of years, and one must\r\nconsider how far this would invalidate the economic case of the\r\n\"outright cut,\" and make it no better than a high income-tax; indeed far\r\nworse, for the high income-tax does at least follow closely upon the\r\nannual facts as they change, or is not stereotyped by a valuation made\r\nin obsolete conditions. Imagine three shipowners each with vessels\r\nvalued at £200,000, and each called upon to pay 20 per cent., or\r\n£40,000. One owning five small ships might have sold one of them, and\r\nthus paid his bill; the second, with one large ship, might have agreed\r\nto pay £8000 annually (plus interest) for five years; while the third\r\nmight have mortgaged his vessel for £40,000, having no other capital at\r\ndisposal. At to-day's values each might have been worth, say, £50,000,\r\nbut for the tax. The first would actually have ships worth £40,000, so\r\nhe would have borne the correct duty of 20 per cent. The second would\r\nhave £50,000, bringing in, say, £5000 annually, and would be attempting\r\nto pay £8000 out of it, while the third would be paying £2000 a year out\r\nof his income and still be faced with an 80 per cent. charge on his\r\nfortune! His assessment is computed at one point of time, and liquidated\r\nat another, when its incidence is totally different.\r\n\r\nIf one cannot have a levy complete at the time of imposition, it clearly\r\nought not to be launched at a time of rapidly changing prices. But that\r\nis, perhaps, when the economic case for it is strongest.\r\n\r\n\r\nA DESPERATE REMEDY\r\n\r\nI do not rule the Capital Levy out as impracticable by any means, but as\r\na taxation expedient I cannot be enthusiastic about it. It is a\r\ndesperate remedy. But if our present temper for \"annual\" tax relief at\r\nall costs continues, we may _need_ a desperate remedy. Without a levy\r\nwhat kind of position can you look forward to? Make some assumptions,\r\nnot with any virtue in their details, but just in order to determine the\r\npossible prospect. If in fifteen to twenty years reparation payments\r\nhave wiped out 1000 millions, debt repayments another 1000, and ordinary\r\nreductions by sinking funds another 1000 millions, you will have the\r\ndebt down to 5000 millions, and possibly the lower interest then\r\neffective may bring the annual charge down to some 200 or 225 million\r\npounds. If the population has reached sixty millions the nominal annual\r\ncharge will be reduced from £7 16s. by one-half, but if prices have\r\ndropped further, say half-way, to the pre-war level, the comparable\r\nburden will still be £4 10s. per head.\r\n\r\nIt is no good talking about \"holidays from taxation\" and imagining you\r\ncan get rid of this thing easily; you won't. We are still in the war\r\nfinancially. There is the same need of the true national spirit and\r\nheroism as there was then. Thus hard facts may ultimately force us to\r\nsome such expedient as the levy, but we should not accept it\r\nlight-heartedly, or regard it as an obvious panacea. Perhaps in two or\r\nthree years we may tell whether economic conditions are stable enough to\r\nrob it of its worst evils. The question whether the burden of rapidly\r\nrelieving debt by this means in an instalment levy over a decade is\r\nactually lighter than the sinking fund method, depends on the relation\r\nof the drop in prices over the short period to the drop over the ensuing\r\nperiod, with a proper allowance for discount--at the moment an insoluble\r\nproblem. I cannot yet with confidence join those who, on purely economic\r\nand non-political grounds, commend the scheme and treat it as \"good\r\nbusiness for the income-tax payer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFREE TRADE\r\n\r\nBY RT. HON. J.M. ROBERTSON\r\n\r\nP.C.; President of National Liberal Federation since 1920; M.P. (L.),\r\nTyneside Division, Northumberland, 1906-18; Parliamentary Secretary to\r\nBoard of Trade, 1911-15.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Robertson said:--At an early stage of the war Mr. H.G. Wells\r\npublished a newspaper article to the effect that while we remained Free\r\nTraders we were determined in future to accord free entry only to the\r\ngoods of those States which allowed it to us. The mere state of war, no\r\ndoubt, predisposed many to assent to such theses who a few years before\r\nwould have remembered that this was but the nominal position of the\r\naverage protectionist of the three preceding generations. War being in\r\nitself the negation of Free Trade, the inevitable restrictions and the\r\nwar temper alike prepared many to find reasons for continuing a\r\nrestrictive policy when the war was over. When, therefore, the Committee\r\nof Lord Balfour of Burleigh published its report, suggesting a variety\r\nof reasons for setting up compromises in a tariffist direction, there\r\nwere not wanting professed Free Traders who agreed that the small\r\ntariffs proposed would not do any harm, while others were even anxious\r\nto think that they might do good.\r\n\r\nYet the policy proposed by Lord Balfour's Committee has not been\r\nadopted by the Coalition Government in anything like its entirety. Apart\r\nfrom the Dyestuffs Act, and such devices as the freeing of home-made\r\nsugar from excise, we have only had the Safeguarding of Industries Bill,\r\na meticulously conditional measure, providing for the setting up of\r\nparticular tariffs in respect of particular industries which may at a\r\ngiven moment be adjudged by special committees _ad hoc_ to need special\r\nprotection from what is loosely called \"dumping.\" And even the findings\r\nof these committees so far have testified above all things to the lack\r\nof any accepted set of principles of a protectionist character. Six\r\nthousand five hundred articles have been catalogued as theoretically\r\nliable to protective treatment, and some dozen have been actually\r\nprotected. They have given protection to certain products and refused it\r\nto others; according it to fabric gloves and glass and aluminium goods\r\nand refusing it to dolls' eyes and gold leaf.\r\n\r\nFinally, the decision in favour of a tariff on fabric gloves has evoked\r\nsuch a storm of protest from the textile manufacturers who export the\r\nyarns with which foreign fabric gloves are made, that even the\r\nCoalitionist press has avowed its nervousness. When a professed\r\nprotectionist like Lord Derby, actually committed to this protectionist\r\nAct, declares that it will never do to protect one industry at the cost\r\nof injuring a much greater one, those of his party who have any\r\nforesight must begin to be apprehensive even when a House of Commons\r\nmajority backs the Government, which, hard driven by its tariffists,\r\ndecided to back its Tariff Committee against Lancashire. Protectionists\r\nare not much given to the searching study of statistics, but many of\r\nthem have mastered the comparatively simple statistical process of\r\ncounting votes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \"NEW CIRCUMSTANCES\" CRY\r\n\r\nIn a sense, there are new fiscal \"circumstances.\" But I can assure my\r\nyoung friends that they are just the kind of circumstances which were\r\nforeseen by their seniors in pre-war days as sure to arise when any\r\nattempt was made to apply tariffist principles to British industry. As a\r\nGerman professor of economics once remarked at a Free Trade Conference,\r\nit is not industries that are protected by tariffs: it is firms. When a\r\nmultitude of firms in various industries subscribed to a large Tariff\r\nReform fund for election-campaign purposes, they commanded a large\r\nConservative vote; but when for platform tariff propaganda, dealing in\r\nimaginative generalities and eclectic statistics, there are substituted\r\ndefinite proposals to meddle with specified interests, the real troubles\r\nof the tariffist begin. You might say that they began as soon as he met\r\nthe Free Trader in argument; but that difficulty did not arise with his\r\nusual audiences. It is when he undertakes to protect hides and hits\r\nleather, or to protect leather and hits boot-making, or to help shipping\r\nand hits shipbuilding that he becomes acutely conscious of difficulties.\r\nNow he is in the midst of them. The threat of setting up a general\r\ntariff which will hit everybody alike seems so far to create no alarm,\r\nbecause few traders now believe in it. Still, it would be very unwise to\r\ninfer that the project will not be proceeded with. It served as a party\r\nwar-cry in Opposition for ten years, and nearly every pre-war\r\nConservative statesman was committed to it--Earl Balfour and Lord\r\nLansdowne included. Even misgivings about Lancashire may fail to deter\r\nthe tariffist rump.\r\n\r\nSome of the people who even yet understand nothing of Free Trade\r\neconomics are still found to argue that, if only the duty on imported\r\ngloves is put high enough, sufficient gloves will be made at home to\r\nabsorb all the yarns now exported to German glove-makers. They are still\r\nblind, that is to say, to the elementary fact that since Germany\r\nmanufactures for a much larger glove-market than the English, the\r\nexclusion of the German gloves means the probable loss to the\r\nyarn-makers of a much larger market than England can possibly offer,\r\neven if we make all our own gloves. In a word, instead of having to\r\nfurnish new Free Trade arguments to meet a new situation, we find\r\nourselves called upon to propound once more the fundamental truths of\r\nFree Trade, which are still so imperfectly assimilated by the nation.\r\n\r\nSo far as I can gather, the circumstances alleged to constitute a new\r\nproblem are these; the need to protect special industries for war\r\npurposes; and the need to make temporary fiscal provision against\r\nindustrial fluctuation set up by variations in the international money\r\nexchanges. Obviously, the first of these pleas has already gone by the\r\nboard, as regards any comprehensive fiscal action. One of the greatest\r\nof all war industries is the production of food; and during the war some\r\nsupposed that after it was over, there could be secured a general\r\nagreement to protect British agriculture to the point at which it could\r\nbe relied on to produce at least a war ration on which the nation could\r\nsubsist without imports. That dream has already been abandoned by\r\npractical politicians, if any of them ever entertained it. The effective\r\nprotection of agriculture on that scale has been dismissed as\r\nimpossible; and we rely on foreign imports as before. Whatever may be\r\nsaid as to the need of subsidising special industries for the production\r\nof certain war material is nothing further to the fiscal purpose,\r\nwhether the alleged need be real or not. The production of war material\r\nis a matter of military policy on all fours with the maintenance of\r\nGovernment dockyards, and does not enter into the fiscal problem\r\nproperly so called. But to the special case of dyes, considered as a\r\n\"key\" or \"pivotal\" industry, I will return later.\r\n\r\nHow then stands the argument from the fluctuations of the exchanges? If\r\nthat argument be valid further than to prove that _all_ monetary\r\nfluctuations are apt to embarrass industry, why is it not founded on for\r\nthe protection of _all_ industries affected by German competition? The\r\nPrime Minister in his highly characteristic speech to the Lancashire\r\ndeputation, admitted that the fall of the mark had not had \"the effect\r\nwhich we all anticipated\"--that is, which he and his advisers\r\nanticipated--and this in the very act of pretending that the _further_\r\nfall of the mark is a reason for adhering to the course of taxing\r\nfabric gloves. All this is the temporising of men who at last realise\r\nthat the case they have been putting forward will bear no further\r\nscrutiny. The idea of systematically regulating an occasional tariff in\r\nterms of the day-to-day fluctuations of the exchanges is wholly\r\nchimerical. A tariff that is on even for one year and may be off the\r\nnext is itself as disturbing a factor in industry as any exchange\r\nfluctuations can be.\r\n\r\nNor is there, in the nature of things, any possibility of continuous\r\nadvantage in trade to any country through the low valuation of its\r\ncurrency. The Prime Minister confesses that Germany is _not_ obtaining\r\nany export trade as the result of the fall. Then the whole argument has\r\nbeen and is a false pretence. The plea that the German manufacturer is\r\nadvantaged because his wages bill does not rise as fast as the mark\r\nfalls in purchasing power is even in theory but a statement of one side\r\nof a fluctuating case, seeing that when the mark rises in value his\r\nwages bill will not fall as fast as the mark rises, and he is then, in\r\nthe terms of the case, at a competitive disadvantage.\r\n\r\nBut the worst absurdity of all in the tariffist reasoning on this topic\r\nis the assumption that in no other respect than wage-rates is German\r\nindustry affected by the fall of the mark. The wiseacres who point\r\nwarningly to the exchanges as a reason for firm action on fabric gloves\r\nnever ask how a falling currency relates to the process of purchasing\r\nraw materials from abroad. So plainly is the falling mark a bar to such\r\npurchase that there is _prima facie_ no cause to doubt the German\r\nofficial statement made in June, that foreign goods are actually\r\nunderbidding German goods in the German markets, and that the falling\r\nexchange makes it harder and harder for Germany to compete abroad. We\r\nare dealing with a four-square fallacy, the logical implication of which\r\nis that a bankrupt country is the best advantaged for trade, that\r\nAustria is even better placed for competition than Germany, and that\r\nRussia is to-day the best placed of all.\r\n\r\n\r\nTARIFFS AND WAGES\r\n\r\nThe argument from the exchanges, which is now admitted to be wholly\r\nfalse in practice, really brings us back to the old tariffist argument\r\nthat tariffs are required to protect us against the imports of countries\r\nwhose general rate of wages is lower than ours. On the one hand, they\r\nassured us that a tariff was the one means of securing good wages for\r\nthe workers in general. On the other, they declared that foreign goods\r\nentered our country to the extent they did because foreign employers in\r\ngeneral sweated their employees. That is to say--seeing that nearly all\r\nour competitors had tariffs--the tariffed countries pay the worst wages;\r\nand we were to raise ours by having tariffs also. But even that pleasing\r\nparalogism did not suffice for the appetite of tariffism in the way of\r\nfallacy. The same propaganda which affirmed the lowness of the rate of\r\nwages paid in tariffist countries affirmed also the _superiority_ of the\r\nrate of wages paid in the United States, whence came much of our\r\nimported goods which the tariffists wished to keep out. In this case,\r\nthe evidence for the statement lay in the high wage-rate figures for\r\nthree employments in particular--those of engine-drivers, compositors,\r\nand builders' labourers: three industries incapable of protection by\r\ntariffs.\r\n\r\nThus even the percentage of truth was turned to the account of delusion;\r\nfor the wages in the protected industries of the States were so far from\r\nbeing on the scale of the others just mentioned, that they were reported\r\nat times to be absolutely below those paid in the same industries in\r\nBritain. For the rest, _costs of living_ were shown by all the official\r\nstatistics to be lower with us than in any of the competing tariffed\r\ncountries; and in particular much lower than in the United States. There\r\nwere thus established the three facts that wages were higher in the Free\r\nTrade country than in the European tariffed countries; that real wages\r\nhere were higher than those of the protected industries in the United\r\nStates, and that Protection was thus so far from being a condition of\r\ngood wages as to be ostensibly a certain condition of bad. All the same,\r\nhigh wages in America and low wages on the Continent were alike given as\r\nreasons why we should have a protective tariff.\r\n\r\nThere stands out, then, the fact that the payment of lower wages by the\r\nprotected foreign manufacturer was one of the tariffist arguments of the\r\npre-war period, when there was no question of unequal currency\r\nexchanges. To-day, the argument from unequal currency exchanges is that\r\nin the country where the currency value is sinking in terms of other\r\ncurrencies the manufacturer is getting his labour cheaper, seeing that\r\nwages are slow to follow increase in cost of living. Both pleas alike\r\nevade the primary truth that if country A trades with country B at all,\r\nit must receive _some_ goods in payment for its exports, save in a case\r\nin which, for a temporary purpose, it may elect to import gold. But that\r\nfact is vital and must be faced if the issue is to be argued at all.\r\nUnless, then, the defender of the occasional tariff system contends that\r\nthat system will rectify trade conditions by keeping out goods which are\r\nmade at an artificial advantage, amounting to what is called \"unfair\r\ncompetition,\" and letting in only the goods not so produced, he is not\r\nfacing the true fiscal problem at all. Either he admits that exports and\r\nfreight charges and other credit claims must be balanced by imports or\r\nhe denies it. If he denies it, the discussion ceases: there is no use in\r\narguing further. If he admits it, and argues that by his tariff he can\r\nmore or less determine _what_ shall be imported, the debate soon narrows\r\nitself to one issue.\r\n\r\nThe pre-war tariffist argued, when he dealt with the problem, that\r\ntariffs would suffice at will to keep out manufactured goods and let in\r\nonly raw material. To that the answer was simple. An unbroken conversion\r\nof the whole yield of exports and freight returns and interest on\r\nforeign investments into imported raw material to be wholly converted\r\ninto new products, mainly for export, was something utterly beyond the\r\npossibilities. It would mean a rate of expansion of exports never\r\nattained and not only not attainable but not desirable. On such a\r\nfooting, the producing and exporting country would never concretely\r\ntaste of its _profit_, which is to be realised, if at all, only in\r\nconsumption of imported goods and foods. It is no less plainly\r\nimpossible to discriminate by classes between kinds of manufactured\r\nimports on the plea that inequality in the exchanges gives the foreign\r\ncompetitor an advantage in terms of the relatively lower wage-rate paid\r\nby him while his currency value is falling. Any such advantage, in the\r\nterms of the case, must be held to accrue to all forms of production\r\nalike, and cannot possibly be claimed to accrue in the manufacture of\r\none thing as compared with another, as fabric gloves in comparison with\r\ngold leaf. In a word, the refusal of protection to gold leaf is an\r\nadmission that the argument from inequality of currency exchanges counts\r\nfor nothing in the operation of the Safeguarding of Industries Bill. In\r\nthe case of any other import, then, the argument falls.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMBERS ONE OF ANOTHER\r\n\r\nBut that is not all. The case of Russia alone has brought home to all\r\ncapable of realising an economic truth the fact that the economic\r\ncollapse of any large mass of population which had in the past entered\r\ninto the totality of international trade is a condition of proportional\r\nimpoverishment to all the others concerned. He who sees this as to\r\nRussia cannot conceivably miss seeing it as to Germany; even tariffist\r\nhallucinations about a \"losing trade\" under German tariffs cannot shut\r\nout the fact that our trade with Russia and the United States was\r\ncarried on under still higher hostile tariffs. The unalterable fact\r\nremains that industrial prosperity rises and falls in the measure of the\r\ntotal mass of goods handled; and men who realise the responsibility of\r\nall Governments for the material wellbeing of their populations can come\r\nto only one conclusion. Trade must be facilitated all round for our own\r\nsake.\r\n\r\nOnce more we come in sight of the truth that the industrial health of\r\nevery trading country depends on the industrial health of the rest--a\r\nFree Trade truth that is perceptibly of more vital importance now than\r\never before. It is in the exchange of commodities, and the extension of\r\nconsumption where that is required on a large scale, that the prosperity\r\nof the industrial nations consists. And to say that, is to say that\r\nuntil the trade exchanges of the world in general return to something\r\nlike the old footing, there cannot be a return of the old degree of\r\nindustrial wellbeing. Not that industrial wellbeing is to be secured by\r\nthe sole means of industrial re-expansion: the question of the need of\r\nrestriction of rate of increase of population is now being more and more\r\nwidely recognised as vital. But the present argument is limited to the\r\nfiscal issue; and it must suffice merely to indicate the other as being\r\nof the highest concurrent importance.\r\n\r\nAdhering, then, to the fiscal issue, we reach the position that, just as\r\nforeign trade has been a main source of British wealth in the past, and\r\nparticularly in the Free Trade era, the wealth consumed in the war is\r\nrecoverable only on the same lines. It is not merely that British\r\nshipping--at present so lamentably paralysed and denuded of earning\r\npower--cannot be restored to prosperity without a large resumption of\r\ninternational exchanges: a large proportion of industrial employment\r\nunalterably depends upon that resumption. And it is wholly impossible to\r\nreturn to pre-war levels of employment by any plan of penalising\r\nimports.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DYESTUFFS ACT\r\n\r\nHow then does the persistent Free Trader relate to the special case of\r\nthe \"key industry,\" of which we heard so much during the war, and hear\r\nso little to-day? I have said that the question of maintaining any given\r\nindustry on the score that it is essential for the production of war\r\nmaterial is a matter of military administration, and not properly a\r\nmatter of fiscal policy at all. But the plea, we know, has been made the\r\nground of a fiscal proceeding by the present Government, inasmuch as the\r\nspecial measure known as the Dyestuffs (Import Regulation) Act of 1920\r\nforbids for ten years the importation of dyestuffs into this country\r\nexcept under licence of the Board of Trade. Dyestuffs include, by\r\ndefinition, all the coal-tar dyes, colours, and colouring matter, and\r\nall organic intermediate products used in the manufacture of these--the\r\nlast category including a large number of chemicals such as\r\nformaldehyde, formic acid, acetic acid, and methyl alcohol. The\r\nargument is, in sum, that all this protective control is necessary to\r\nkeep on foot, on a large scale, an industry which in time of war has\r\nbeen proved essential for the production of highly important munitions.\r\n\r\nWhat has actually happened under this Act I confess I am unable to tell.\r\nWeeks ago I wrote to the President of the Board of Trade asking if,\r\nwithout inconvenience, he could favour me with a general account of what\r\nhad been done in the matter of issuing licences, and my letter was\r\npromised attention, but up to the moment of delivering this address I\r\nhave had no further reply. I can only, then, discuss the proposed policy\r\non its theoretic merits.[1] The theoretic issues are fairly clear.\r\nEither the licensing power of the Board of Trade has been used to\r\nexclude competitive imports or it has not. If it has been so used, it is\r\nobvious that we have no security whatever for the maintenance of the\r\nindustry in question in a state of efficiency. In the terms of the case,\r\nit is enabled to persist in the use of plant and of methods which may be\r\ninferior to those used in the countries whose competition has been\r\nexcluded. Then the very object posited as the justification for the Act,\r\nthe securing of a thoroughly efficient key industry necessary to the\r\nproduction of munitions, is not attained by the fiscal device under\r\nnotice. If, on the other hand, there has been no barring of imports\r\nunder the licence system, the abstention from use of it is an admission\r\nthat it was either unnecessary or injurious or was felt to be useless\r\nfor its purpose.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The promised statistics were soon afterwards sent to Mr.\r\nRobertson by the Board of Trade. They will be found in the _Liberal\r\nMagazine_ for September, 1922, p. 348.--ED.]\r\n\r\nAnd the common-sense verdict on the whole matter is that if continuous\r\nand vigilant research and experiment in the chemistry of dye-making is\r\nheld to be essential to the national safety, the proper course is for\r\nthe Government to establish and maintain a department or arsenal for\r\nsuch research and experiment, unhampered by commercial exigencies. Such\r\nan institution may or may not be well managed. But a dividend-earning\r\ncompany, necessarily concerned first and last with dividend earning, and\r\nat the same time protected against foreign competition in the sale of\r\nits products, cannot be for the purpose in question well managed, being\r\nexpressly enabled and encouraged to persist in out-of-date practices.\r\n\r\nThis being so, the whole argument for protection of key industries goes\r\nby the board. It has been abandoned as to agriculture, surely the most\r\ntypical key industry of all; and it has never even been put forward in\r\nregard to shipbuilding, the next in order of importance. For the\r\nbuilding of ships of war the Government has its own dockyards: let it\r\nhave its own chemical works, if that be proved to be necessary.\r\nProtection cannot avail. If the Dyestuffs Act is put in operation so as\r\nto exclude the competition of foreign chemicals, it not only keeps our\r\nchemists in ignorance of the developments of the industry abroad: it\r\nraises the prices of dyestuffs against the dye-using industries at home,\r\nand thereby handicaps them dangerously in their never-ending competition\r\nwith the foreign industries, German and other, which offer the same\r\ngoods in foreign markets.\r\n\r\nThe really fatal competition is never that of goods produced at low\r\nwages-cost. It is that of superior goods; and if foreign textiles have\r\nthe aid of better dyes than are available to our manufacturers our\r\nindustry will be wounded incurably. It appears in fact to be the\r\nsuperior quality of German fabric gloves, and not their cheapness, that\r\nhas hitherto defeated the competition of the native product. To protect\r\ninferior production is simply the road to ruin for a British industry.\r\nDelicacy in dyes, in the pre-war days, gave certain French woollen goods\r\nan advantage over ours in our own markets; yet we maintained our vast\r\nsuperiority in exports by the free use of all the dyes available. Let\r\nprotection operate all round, and our foreign markets will be closed to\r\nus by our own political folly. Textiles which are neither well-dyed nor\r\ncheap will be unsaleable against better goods.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PARIS RESOLUTIONS\r\n\r\nIt is of a piece with that prodigy of self-contradiction that, when the\r\nLiberal leaders in the House of Commons expose the absurdity of\r\nprofessing to rectify the German exchanges by keeping out German fabric\r\ngloves, a tariffist leader replies by arguing that the Paris Resolutions\r\nof the first Coalition Government, under Mr. Asquith, conceded the\r\nnecessity of protecting home industries against unfair competition. Men\r\nwho are normally good debaters seem, when they are fighting for a\r\ntariff, to lose all sense of the nature of argument. As has been\r\nrepeatedly and unanswerably shown by my right hon. friend the Chairman,\r\nthe Paris Resolutions were expressly framed to guard against a state of\r\nthings which has never supervened--a state of things then conceived as\r\npossible after a war without a victory, but wholly excluded by the\r\nactual course of the war. And those Resolutions, all the same, expressly\r\nprovided that each consenting State should remain free to act on them\r\nupon the lines of its established fiscal system, Britain being thus left\r\nuntrammelled as to its Free Trade policy.\r\n\r\nHaving regard to the whole history, Free Traders are entitled to say\r\nthat the attempt of tariffists to cite the Paris Resolutions in support\r\nof the pitiful policy of taxing imports of German fabric gloves, or the\r\nrest of the ridiculous \"litter of mice\" that has thus far been yielded\r\nby the Safeguarding of Industries Act, is the crowning proof at once of\r\nthe insincerity and ineptitude of tariffism where it has a free hand,\r\nand of the adamantine strength of the Free Trade case. If any further\r\nillustration were needed, it is supplied by the other tariffist\r\nprocedure in regard to the promise made five years ago to Canada that\r\nshe, with the other Dominions, should have a relative preference in our\r\nmarkets for her products. In so far as that plan involved an advantage\r\nto our own Dominions over the Allies who, equally with them, bore with\r\nus the heat and burden of the war, it was as impolitic as it was unjust,\r\nand as unflattering as it was impolitic, inasmuch as it assumed that the\r\nDominions wanted a \"tip\" as a reward for their splendid comradeship.\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, the one concession that Canada really wanted was the\r\nremoval of the invidious embargo on Canadian store cattle in our ports.\r\nAnd whereas a promise to that effect was actually given by the tariffist\r\nCoalition during the war, it is only after five years that the promise\r\nis about to be reluctantly fulfilled. It was a promise, be it observed,\r\nof _free importation_, and it is fulfilled only out of very shame. It\r\nmay be surmised, indeed, that the point of the possible lifting of the\r\nCanadian embargo was used during the negotiations with Ireland to bring\r\nthe Sister State to terms; and that its removal may lead to new trouble\r\nin that direction. But that is another story, with which Free Traders\r\nare not concerned. Their withers are unwrung.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCIENCE AND EXPERIENCE\r\n\r\nOn the total survey, then, the case for Free Trade is not only unshaken,\r\nit is stronger than ever before, were it only because many of the enemy\r\nhave visibly lost faith in their own cause. The Coalition, in which\r\nprofessed Liberals were prepared to sacrifice something of Free Trade to\r\ncolleagues who were pledged in the past to destroy it, has quailed\r\nbefore the insuperable practical difficulties which arise the moment the\r\nscheme of destruction is sought to be framed.\r\n\r\nAll that has resulted, after four and a half years, is a puerile\r\ntinkering with three or four small industries--a tinkering that is on\r\nthe face of it open to suspicion of political corruption. To intelligent\r\nFree Traders there is nothing in it all that can give the faintest\r\nsurprise. They knew their ground. The doctrine of Free Trade is\r\n_science_, or it is nothing. It is not a passing cry of faction, or a\r\nsurvival of prejudice, but the unshakable inference of a hundred years\r\nof economic experience verifying the economic science on which the great\r\nexperiment was founded.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, let me say, the tactic of tinkering with Free Trade\r\nunder a system of special committees who make decisions that only the\r\nHouse of Commons should ever be able to make, is a \"felon blow\" at\r\nself-government. It puts national affairs under the control of cliques,\r\namenable to the pressures of private interests. Millions of men and\r\nwomen are thus taxable in respect of their living-costs at the caprice\r\nof handfuls of men appointed to do for a shifty Government what it is\r\nafraid to do for itself. It is a vain thing to have secured by statute\r\nthat the House of Commons shall be the sole authority in matters of\r\ntaxation, if the House of Commons basely delegates its powers to\r\nunrepresentative men. Here, as so often in the past, the Free Trade\r\nissue lies at the heart of sound democratic politics; and if the nation\r\ndoes not save its liberties in the next election it will pay the price\r\nin corrupted politics no less than in ruined trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIA\r\n\r\nBY SIR HAMILTON GRANT\r\n\r\nK.C.S.I., K.C.I.E.; Chief Commissioner, North-West Frontier Province,\r\nIndia; Deputy Commissioner of various Frontier districts; Secretary to\r\nFrontier Administration; Foreign Secretary, 1914-19; negotiated Peace\r\nTreaty with Afghanistan, 1919.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Hamilton Grant said:--I have been asked to address you on the\r\nsubject of India, that vast, heterogeneous continent, with its varied\r\nraces, its Babel of languages, its contending creeds. There are many\r\ndirections in which one might approach so immense a topic, presenting,\r\nas it does, all manner of problems, historical, ethnological,\r\nlinguistic, scientific, political, economic, and strategic. I do not\r\npropose, however, to attempt to give you any general survey of those\r\nquestions, or to offer you in tabloid form a resumé of the matters that\r\nconcern the government of India. I propose to confine my remarks to two\r\nmain questions which appear to be of paramount importance at the present\r\ntime, and which, I believe, will be of interest to those here present\r\nto-day, namely, the problems of the North-West Frontier, and the\r\nquestion of internal political unrest.\r\n\r\nLet me deal first with the North-West Frontier. As very few schoolboys\r\nknow, we have here a dual boundary--an inner and an outer line. The\r\ninner line is the boundary of the settled districts of the North-West\r\nFrontier Province, the boundary, in fact, of British India proper, and\r\nis known as the Administrative border. The outer line is the boundary\r\nbetween the Indian Empire and Afghanistan, and is commonly known as the\r\nDurand line, because it was settled by Sir Mortimer Durand and his\r\nmission in 1895 with the old Amir Abdur Rahman. These two lines give us\r\nthree tracts to be dealt with--first, the tract inside the inner line,\r\nthe settled districts of the North-West Frontier Province, inhabited for\r\nthe most part by sturdy and somewhat turbulent Pathans; second, the\r\ntract between the two lines, that welter of mountains where dwell the\r\nhardy brigand hillmen: the tribes of the Black Mountain, of Swat and\r\nBajur, the Mohmands, the Afridis, the Orakzais, the Wazirs, the Mahsuds,\r\nand a host of others, whose names from time to time become familiar\r\naccording as the outrageousness of their misconduct necessitates\r\nmilitary operations; third, the country beyond the outer line, \"the\r\nGod-granted kingdom of Afghanistan and its dependencies.\"\r\n\r\nNow each of these tracts presents its own peculiar problems, though all\r\nare intimately inter-connected and react one on the other. In the\r\nsettled districts we are confronted with the task of maintaining law and\r\norder among a backward but very virile people, prone to violence and\r\nimpregnated with strange but binding ideas of honour, for the most part\r\nat variance with the dictates of the Indian Penal Code. For this reason\r\nthere exists a special law called the Frontier Crimes Regulation, a most\r\nvaluable enactment enabling us to deal with cases through local\r\nCouncils of Elders, with the task of providing them with education,\r\nmedical relief etc., in accordance with their peculiar needs, and above\r\nall with the task of affording them protection from the raids and forays\r\nof their neighbours from the tribal hills. In the tribal area we are\r\nfaced with the task of controlling the wild tribesmen. This control\r\nvaries from practically direct administration as in the Lower Swat and\r\nKurram valleys to the most shadowy political influence, as in the remote\r\nhighlands of Upper Swat and the Dir Kohistan, where the foot of white\r\nman has seldom trod. Our general policy, however, with the tribes is to\r\nleave them independent in their internal affairs, so long as they\r\nrespect British territory and certain sacrosanct tracts beyond the\r\nborder, such as the Khyber road, the Kurram, and the Tochi. The problem\r\nis difficult, because when hardy and well-armed hereditary robbers live\r\nin inaccessible mountains which cannot support the inhabitants,\r\noverlooking fat plains, the temptation to raid is obviously\r\nconsiderable: and when this inclination to raid is reinforced by\r\nfanatical religion, there must be an ever-present likelihood of trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRONTIER RAIDS\r\n\r\nFew people here in England reading of raids on the North-West Frontier\r\nin India realise the full horror of these outrages. What generally\r\nhappens is that in the small hours of the morning, a wretched village is\r\nsuddenly assailed by a gang of perhaps 50, perhaps 200, well-armed\r\nraiders, who put out sentries, picket the approaches, and conduct the\r\noperation on the most skilful lines. The houses of the wealthiest men\r\nare attacked and looted; probably several villagers are brutally\r\nmurdered--and probably one or two unhappy youths or women are carried\r\noff to be held up to ransom. Sometimes the raid is on a larger scale,\r\nsometimes it is little more than an armed dacoity. But there is nearly\r\nalways a tale of death and damage. Not infrequently, however, our\r\ntroops, our militia, our frontier constabulary, our armed police, or the\r\nvillage _chigha_ or hue-and-cry party are successful in repelling and\r\ndestroying the raiders. Our officers are untiring in their vigilance,\r\nand not infrequently the district officers and the officers of their\r\ncivil forces are out three or four nights a week after raiding gangs.\r\nStatistics in such matters are often misleading and generally dull, but\r\nit may be of interest to state that from the 1st April, 1920, to the\r\n31st March, 1921, when the tribal ebullition consequent on the third\r\nAfghan war had begun to die down, there were in the settled districts of\r\nthe North-West Frontier Province 391 raids in which 153 British subjects\r\nwere killed and 157 wounded, in which 310 British subjects were\r\nkidnapped and some £20,000 of property looted. These raids are often led\r\nby outlaws from British territory; but each tribe is responsible for\r\nwhat emanates from or passes through its limits--and when the bill\r\nagainst a tribe has mounted up beyond the possibility of settlement,\r\nthere is nothing for it but punitive military operations. Hence the\r\nlarge number of military expeditions that have taken place on this\r\nborder within the last half century.\r\n\r\nNow this brings us to the question so often asked by the advocates of\r\nwhat is called the Forward policy: \"If the tribes give so much trouble,\r\nwhy not go in and conquer them once and for all and occupy the country\r\nup to the Durand line?\" It sounds an attractive solution, and it has\r\nfrequently been urged on paper by expert soldiers. But the truth is that\r\nto advance our frontier only means advancing the seat of trouble, and\r\nthat the occupation of tribal territory by force is a much more\r\nformidable undertaking than it sounds. We have at this moment before us\r\na striking proof of the immense difficulty and expense of attempting to\r\ntame and occupy even a comparatively small tract of tribal territory in\r\nthe Waziristan operations. Those operations have been going on for two\r\nand a half years. At the start there were ample troops, ample equipment,\r\nand no financial stringency. The operations were conducted, if a layman\r\nmay say so, with skill and determination, and our troops fought\r\ngallantly. But what is the upshot? We managed to advance into the heart\r\nof the Mahsud country on a single line, subjected and still subject to\r\nincessant attacks by the enemy; but we are very little nearer effective\r\noccupation than when we started; and now financial stringency has\r\nnecessitated a material alteration in the whole programme, and we are\r\nreverting more or less to the methods whereby we have always controlled\r\nthe tribes, namely, tribal levies or _khassadars_ belonging to the\r\ntribe itself, frontier militia or other armed civil force, backed by\r\ntroops behind.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRONTIER POLICY\r\n\r\nAnd for my own part I believe this is the best solution. We must not\r\nexpect a millennium on the North-West Frontier. The tribal lion will not\r\nlie down beside the district lamb in our time, and we must deal with the\r\nproblem as best we can in accordance with our means, and to this end my\r\nviews are briefly as follows:--\r\n\r\n(1) We should do everything possible to provide the younger trans-border\r\ntribesmen with all honourable employment for which they are suited:\r\nservice in the army, in the frontier civil forces, and in the Indian\r\npolice or similar forces overseas, and we should give labour and\r\ncontracts as far as possible to tribesmen for public works in their\r\nvicinity. For the problem is largely economic. Unless the lion gets\r\nother food he is bound to cast hungry eyes on the lamb.\r\n\r\n(2) We should do all that is possible to establish friendly relations\r\nwith the tribal elders through selected and sympathetic political\r\nofficers, to give them, by means of subsidies for service, an interest\r\nin controlling the hot-bloods of their tribe, and, where possible, to\r\ngive them assistance in education and enlightenment. We must remember\r\nthat we have duties to the tribes as well as rights against them.\r\n\r\n(3) We should extend the _khassadar_ or levy system; that is, we should\r\npay for tribal corps to police their own borders, arming themselves and\r\nproviding their own ammunition and equipment. In this way we give\r\nhonourable employment and secure an effective safeguard against raiders\r\nwithout pouring more arms into tribal territory.\r\n\r\n(4) We must have efficient irregular civil forces, militia, frontier\r\nconstabulary, and police, well paid and contented.\r\n\r\n(5) We should revert to the old system of a separate frontier force in\r\nthe army, specially trained in the work of guarding the marches. Those\r\nwho remember the magnificent old Punjab frontier force will agree with\r\nme in deploring its abolition in pursuance of a scheme of army\r\nreorganisation.\r\n\r\n(6) We should improve communications, telephones, telegraphs, and\r\nlateral M.T. roads.\r\n\r\n(7) We should give liberal rewards for the interception and destruction\r\nof raiding gangs, and the rounding up of villages from which raids\r\nemanate.\r\n\r\n(8) We should admit that the Amir of Afghanistani for religious reasons\r\nexercises a paramount influence over our tribes, and we should get him\r\nto use that influence for the maintenance of peace on our common border.\r\nIt has been the practise of our statesmen to adopt the attitude that\r\nbecause the Amir was by treaty precluded from interfering with our\r\ntribes, therefore he must have nothing to do with them. This is a\r\nshort-sighted view. We found during the Great War the late Amir's\r\ninfluence, particularly over the Mahsuds, of the greatest value, when he\r\nagreed to use it on our behalf.\r\n\r\n(9) Finally, there is a suggestion afoot that the settled districts of\r\nthe North-West Frontier Province should be re-amalgamated with the\r\nPunjab. I have shown, I think, clearly, how inseparable are the problems\r\nof the districts, the tribal area, and of Afghanistan; and any attempt\r\nto place the districts under a separate control could only mean\r\nfriction, inefficiency, and disaster. The proposal is, indeed, little\r\nshort of administrative lunacy. There is, however, an underlying method\r\nin the madness that has formulated it, namely, the self-interest of a\r\nclever minority, which I need not now dissect. I trust that if this\r\nproposal should go further it will be stoutly resisted.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFGHANISTAN\r\n\r\nLet me now turn to Afghanistan. Generally speaking, the story of our\r\ndealings with that country has been a record of stupid, arrogant muddle.\r\nFrom the days of the first Afghan war, when an ill-fated army was\r\ndespatched on its crazy mission to place a puppet king, Shah Shuja, on\r\nthe throne of Afghanistan, our statesmen have, with some notable\r\nexceptions, mishandled the Afghan problem. And yet it is simple enough\r\nin itself. For we want very little of Afghanistan, and she does\r\nnot really want much of us. All we want from the Amir is\r\ngood-neighbourliness; that he should not allow his country to become the\r\nfocus of intrigue or aggression against us by Powers hostile to us, and\r\nthat he should co-operate with us for the maintenance of peace on our\r\ncommon border. All he wants of us is some assistance in money and\r\nmunitions for the internal and external safeguarding of his realm,\r\ncommercial and other facilities, and honourable recognition, for the\r\nAfghan, like the Indian, has a craving for self-respect and the respect\r\nof others.\r\n\r\nNow, where our statesmen have failed is in regarding Afghanistan as a\r\npetty little State to be browbeaten and ordered about at our pleasure,\r\nwithout recognising the very valuable cards that the Amir holds against\r\nus. He sees his hand and appraises it at its value. He knows, in the\r\nfirst place, that nothing can be more embarrassing to us than the\r\nnecessity for another Afghan war, and the despatch of a large force to\r\nthe highlands of Kabul, to sit there possibly for years as an army of\r\noccupation, in a desolate country, incapable of affording supplies for\r\nthe troops, at enormous cost which could never be recovered, and at the\r\nexpense of much health and life, with no clear-cut policy beyond. He\r\nknows, in the second place, that such a war would be the signal for the\r\nrising of practically every tribe along our frontier. The cry of _Jehad_\r\nwould go forth, as in the third Afghan war, and we should be confronted\r\nsooner or later with an outburst from the Black Mountain to\r\nBaluchistan--a formidable proposition in these days. He knows, in the\r\nthird place, that with Moslem feeling strained as it is to-day on the\r\nsubject of Turkey, there would be sympathy for him in India, and among\r\nthe Moslem troops of the Indian army. Now these are serious\r\nconsiderations, but I do not suggest that they are so serious as to make\r\nus tolerate for a moment an offensive or unreasonable attitude on the\r\npart of the Amir. If the necessity should be forced on us, which God\r\nforbid, we should face the position with promptitude and firmness and\r\nhit at once; and apart from an advance into Afghanistan we have a\r\nvaluable card in the closing of the passes and the blockade of that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAll I suggest is that in negotiating with Afghanistan, we should\r\nremember these things and should not attempt to browbeat a proud and\r\nsensitive ruler, who, however inferior in the ordinary equipment for\r\nregular war, holds such valuable assets on his side. And my own\r\nexperience is that the Afghans are not unreasonable. Like every one\r\nelse, they will \"try it on,\" but if handled courteously, kindly, with\r\ngeniality, and, above all, with complete candour, they will generally\r\nsee reason. And remember one thing. In spite of all that has happened,\r\nour mistakes, our bluster, our occasional lapses from complete\r\ndisingenuousness, the Afghans still like us. Moreover, their hereditary\r\nmistrust of Russia still inclines them to lean on us. We have lately\r\nconcluded a treaty with Afghanistan--not by any means a perfect treaty,\r\nbut the best certainly that could be secured in the circumstances, and\r\nwe have sent a Minister to Kabul, Lt.-Colonel Humphrys, who was one of\r\nmy officers on the frontier. A better man for the post could not, I\r\nbelieve, be found in the Empire. Unless unduly hampered by a hectoring\r\ndiplomacy from Whitehall, he will succeed in establishing that goodwill\r\nand mutual confidence which between Governments is of more value than\r\nall the paper engagements ever signed. One word more of the Afghans.\r\nThere is an idea that they are a treacherous and perfidious people.\r\nThis, I believe, is wicked slander, so far as the rulers are concerned.\r\nIn 1857, during the Indian Mutiny, the Amir Dost Muhammed was true to\r\nhis bond, when he might have been a thorn in our side; and during the\r\nGreat War the late Amir Halilullah, in the face of appalling\r\ndifficulties, maintained the neutrality of his country, as he promised,\r\nand was eventually murdered, a martyr to his own good faith to us.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERNAL UNREST\r\n\r\nLet me now turn to our second question: internal political unrest. In\r\nclubs and other places where wise men in arm-chairs lay down the law\r\nabout affairs of state, one constantly hears expressions of surprise and\r\nindignation that there should be any unrest in India at all. \"We have,\"\r\nsay the die-hard wiseacres, \"governed India jolly well and jolly\r\nhonestly, and the Indians ought to be jolly grateful instead of kicking\r\nup all this fuss. If that meddlesome Montagu had not put these wicked\r\ndemocratic ideas into their heads, and stirred up all this mud, we\r\nshould have gone on quite comfortable as before.\" But if we face the\r\nfacts squarely, we shall see that the wonder is not that there has been\r\nso much, but that there has been so comparatively little unrest, and\r\nthat India should, on the whole, have waited so patiently for a definite\r\nadvance towards self-government.\r\n\r\nWhat are the facts? They are these. Partly by commercial enterprise,\r\npartly by adroit diplomacy, partly by accident, largely by the valour of\r\nour arms, we have obtained dominion over the great continent of India.\r\nWe have ruled it for more than a century through the agency of a handful\r\nof Englishmen, alien in creed, colour, and custom from the people whom\r\nthey rule--men who do not even make their permanent homes in the land\r\nthey administer. Now, however efficient, however honest, however\r\nimpartial, however disinterested such a rule may be, it cannot obviously\r\nbe really agreeable to the peoples ruled. This is the fundamental\r\nweakness of our position. That our rule on these lines has lasted so\r\nlong and has been so successful is due not to the fact alone that it has\r\nbeen backed by British bayonets, but rather to the fact that it has been\r\nremarkably efficient, honest, just, and disinterested--and, above all,\r\nthat we have in the past given and secured goodwill.\r\n\r\nSuperimposed on this underlying irritant, there have been of late years\r\na number of other more direct causes of unrest. Education, which we gave\r\nto India and were bound to give, had inevitably bred political\r\naspiration, and an _intelligensia_ had grown up hungry for political\r\nrights and powers. Simultaneously the voracious demands of a centralised\r\nbureaucracy for reports and returns had left the district officer little\r\nleisure for that close touch with the people which in the past meant\r\nconfidence and goodwill. Political restlessness had already for some\r\nyears begun to manifest itself in anarchical conspiracies and crimes of\r\nviolence, when the Great War began. In India, as elsewhere, the reflex\r\naction of the war was a disturbing element. High prices, stifled trade,\r\nhigh taxation, nationalist longings and ideas of self-determination and\r\nself-government served to reinforce subterranean agitation.\r\n\r\nBut throughout the war India not only remained calm and restrained, but\r\nher actual contribution to the war, in men and material, was colossal\r\nand was ungrudgingly given. She had a right to expect in return generous\r\ntreatment; but what did she get? She got the Rowlatt Bill. Now, of\r\ncourse, there was a great deal of wicked, lying nonsense talked by\r\nagitators about the provisions of the Rowlatt Bill, and the people were\r\ngrossly misled. But the plain fact remains that when India had emerged\r\nfrom the trying ordeal of the war, not only with honour untarnished, but\r\nhaving placed us under a great obligation, our first practical return\r\nwas to pass a repressive measure, for fear, forsooth, that if it was not\r\npassed then it might be pigeon-holed and forgotten. India asked for\r\nbread and we gave her a stone--a stupid, blundering act, openly\r\ndeprecated at the time by all moderate unofficial opinion in India. What\r\nwas the result? The Punjab disturbances and the preventive massacre of\r\nthe Jallianwala Bagh. I do not propose to dwell on this deplorable and\r\nsadly mishandled matter, save to say that so far from cowing agitation,\r\nit has left a legacy of hate that it will take years to wipe out; and\r\nthat the subsequent action of a number of ill-informed persons in\r\nraising a very large sum of money for the officer responsible for that\r\nmassacre has further estranged Indians and emphasised in their eyes the\r\nbrand of their subjection.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RISE OF GHANDI\r\n\r\nTo India, thus seething with bitterness over the Punjab disturbances,\r\nthere was added the Moslem resentment over the fate of Turkey. I was\r\nmyself in London and Paris in a humble capacity at the Peace Conference,\r\nand I know that our leading statesmen were fully informed of the Moslem\r\nattitude and the dangers of unsympathetic and dilatory action in this\r\nmatter. But an arrogant diplomacy swept all warnings aside and scorned\r\nthe Moslem menace as a bogey. What was the result? Troubles in Egypt, in\r\nMesopotamia, Kurdistan, Afghanistan, and the Khilifat movement in India.\r\nHindu agitators were not slow to exploit Moslem bitterness, and for the\r\nfirst time there was a genuine, if very ephemeral, _entente_ between the\r\ntwo great rival creeds.\r\n\r\nIt was in this electric atmosphere that Ghandi, emerging from his\r\nascetic retirement, found himself an unchallenged leader. Short of\r\nstature, frail, with large ears, and a gap in his front teeth, he had\r\nnone of the outward appearance of dominance. His appeal lay in the\r\nsimplicity of his life and character, for asceticism is still revered in\r\nthe East. But his intellectual equipment was mediocre, his political\r\nideas nebulous and impracticable to a degree, his programme archaic and\r\nvisionary; and from the start he was doomed to fail. The _Hijrat_\r\nmovement which he advocated brought ruin to thousands of Moslem homes;\r\nhis attack on Government educational establishments brought disaster to\r\nmany youthful careers; non-co-operation fizzled out. Government servants\r\nwould not resign their appointments, lawyers would not cease to\r\npractise, and title-holders, with a few insignificant exceptions, would\r\nnot surrender their titles; the \"back to the spinning-wheel\" call did\r\nnot attract, and the continual failure of Ghandi's predictions of the\r\nimmediate attainment of complete _Swaraj_ or self-government, which he\r\nwas careful never to define, like hope deferred turned the heart sick.\r\n\r\nFrom being a demi-god Ghandi gradually became a bore, and when he was at\r\nlast arrested, tragic to relate, there was hardly a tremor of resentment\r\nthrough the tired political nerves of India. The arrest was indeed a\r\ntriumph of wise timing that does credit to the sagacity of the\r\nGovernment of India. Had the arrest been effected when the name of\r\nGhandi was at its zenith, there would have been widespread trouble and\r\nbloodshed. As it was, people were only too glad to be rid of a gadfly\r\nthat merely goaded them into infructuous bogs.\r\n\r\nI apologise for this long excursus on the somewhat threadbare subject of\r\nthe causes of unrest in India. But I want those here present to realise\r\nwhat potent forces have been at work and to believe that the Indian\r\ngenerally is not the ungrateful, black-hearted seditionist he is painted\r\nby the reactionary press. India is going through an inevitable stage of\r\npolitical transition, and we must not hastily judge her peoples--for the\r\nmost part so gallant, so kindly, so law-abiding, so lovable--by the\r\npassing tantrums of political puberty.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESENT SITUATION\r\n\r\nAs things stand at present, there is a remarkable lull. It would be\r\nfutile to predict whether it will last. It is due in part, as I have\r\nsuggested, to general political weariness, in part to the drastic action\r\ntaken against the smaller agitating fry, in part to the depletion of the\r\ncoffers of the extremists, in part to the fact that the extremists are\r\nquarrelling amongst themselves as to their future programme. Some are\r\nfor continuing a boycott of the Councils; others are for capturing all\r\nthe seats and dominating the legislature; others are for re-beating the\r\ndead horse of non-co-operation. Meanwhile, with disunion in the\r\nextremist camp, the Councils conduct their business on moderate lines,\r\nand, so far as one can judge, with marked temperance and sanity.\r\n\r\nThe work of the first Councils has indeed been surprisingly good, and\r\naugurs well for the future. India has not yet, of course, by any means\r\ngrasped the full significance of representative government. The party\r\nsystem is still in embryo, although two somewhat vague and nebulous\r\nparties calling themselves the \"Nationalists\" and the \"Democrats\" do\r\nexist. But these parties have no clear-cut programme, and they do not\r\nfollow the lead of the Ministers, who are regarded, not as representing\r\nthe elected members of the Council, but as newly-appointed additional\r\nmembers of the official bureaucracy. There will doubtless in time be\r\ngradual sorting of politicians into definite groups, but there are two\r\nunbridgeable gulfs in the Indian social system which must always\r\nmilitate against the building up of a solid political party system:\r\nfirst, the gulf between Hindu and Moslem, which still yawns as wide as\r\never, and second, the gulf between the Brahman and the \"untouchables\"\r\nwho, by the way, have found their fears that they would be downtrodden\r\nunder the new Councils completely baseless.\r\n\r\nThere are and must be breakers ahead. Some we can see, and there are\r\ndoubtless others still bigger which we cannot yet glimpse over the\r\nwelter of troubled waters. What we can see is this: first, there is a\r\ndanger that unless Government and the Councils together can before the\r\nnext elections in 1923-24 take definite steps towards the industrial\r\ndevelopment and the self-defence of India, the extremist party are\r\nlikely to come in in full force and to create a deadlock in the\r\nadministration; second, unless the Councils continue to accept a fiscal\r\npolicy in accordance with the general interests of Great Britain and the\r\nEmpire, there will be trouble. The fiscal position is obscure, but it is\r\nthe crux, for the Councils can indirectly stultify any policy\r\ndistasteful to them, and this too may mean a deadlock; third, there is a\r\ndanger that the Indianisation of the Services will advance much more\r\nrapidly than was ever contemplated, or than is desirable in the\r\ninterests of India for many years to come, for the simple reason that\r\ncapable young Englishmen of the right stamp will not, without adequate\r\nguarantees for their future, accept employment in India. Those\r\nguarantees can be given satisfactorily by one authority alone, and that\r\nis by the Indian Legislatures voicing popular opinion. For a complex\r\nadministration bristling with technical questions, administrative,\r\npolitical, and economic, it is essential that India should have for many\r\nyears to come the assistance of highly-educated Britons with the\r\ntradition of administration in their blood. The Councils will be wise to\r\nrecognise this and make conditions which will secure for them in the\r\nfuture as in the past the best stamp of adventurous Briton.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Montagu-Chelmsford scheme, though a capable and\r\nconscientious endeavour to give gradual effect to a wise and generous\r\npolicy, has of necessity its weak points. The system of diarchy--of\r\nallotting certain matters to the bureaucratic authority of the Viceroy\r\nand of the Provincial Governors and other matters to the representatives\r\nof the people--is obviously a stop-gap, which is already moribund. The\r\nattempt to fix definite periods at which further advances towards\r\nself-government can be considered is bound to fail: you cannot give\r\npolitical concessions by a stop-watch; the advance will either be much\r\nmore rapid or much slower than the scheme anticipates. Again, the\r\npresent basis of election is absurdly small, but any attempt to broaden\r\nit must tend towards adult suffrage, which in itself would appear\r\nimpracticable with a population of over 200 millions.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR DUTY TO INDIA\r\n\r\nIt is a mistake, however, in politics to look too far ahead. Sufficient\r\nunto the day. For the time being we may be certain of one thing, and\r\nthat is that we cannot break the Indian connection and leave India. Both\r\nour interests and our obligations demand that we should remain at the\r\nhelm of Indian affairs for many years to come. That being so, let us\r\naccept our part cheerfully and with goodwill as in the past. Let us try\r\nto give India of our best, as we have done heretofore. Let us regive and\r\nregain, above all things, goodwill. Let us not resent the loss of past\r\nprivilege, the changes in our individual status, and let us face the\r\nposition in a practical and good-humoured spirit. Let us abandon all\r\ntalk of holding India by the sword, as we won it by the sword--because\r\nboth propositions are fundamentally false. Let us realise that we have\r\nheld India by integrity, justice, disinterested efficiency--and, above\r\nall, by goodwill--and let us continue to co-operate with India in India\r\nfor India on these same lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEGYPT\r\n\r\nBY J.A. SPENDER\r\n\r\nEditor of the _Westminster Gazette_, 1896 to 1922; Member of the Special\r\nMission to Egypt, 1919-1920.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Spender said:--The Egyptian problem resembles the Indian and all\r\nother Eastern problems in that there is no simple explanation or\r\nsolution of it. Among the many disagreeable surprises which awaited us\r\nafter the war, none was more disagreeable than the discovery in March,\r\n1919, that Egypt was in a state of rebellion. For years previously we\r\nhad considered Egypt a model of imperial administration. We had pulled\r\nher out of bankruptcy and given her prosperity. We had provided her with\r\ngreat public works which had enriched both pasha and fellah. We had\r\nscrupulously refrained from exploiting her in our own interests. No man\r\never worked so disinterestedly for a country not his own as Lord Cromer\r\nfor Egypt, and if ever a Nationalist movement could have been killed by\r\nkindness, it should have been the Egyptian. Nor were the Egyptian people\r\nungrateful. I have talked to Egyptian Nationalists of all shades, and\r\nseldom found any who did not handsomely acknowledge what Great Britain\r\nhad done for Egypt, but they asked for one thing more, which was that\r\nshe should restore them their independence. \"We won it from the Turks,\"\r\nthey said, \"and we cannot allow you to take it from us.\"\r\n\r\nThis demand was no new thing, but it was brought to a climax by events\r\nduring and after the war. When the war broke out, our representative in\r\nEgypt was still only \"Agent and Consul-General,\" and was theoretically\r\nand legally on the same footing with the representative of all other\r\nPowers; when it ended, he was \"High Commissioner,\" governing by martial\r\nlaw under a system which we called a \"protectorate.\" This to the\r\nEgyptians seemed a definite and disastrous change for the worse.\r\nThroughout the forty years of our occupation we have most carefully\r\npreserved the theory of Egyptian independence. We have occupied and\r\nadministered the country, but we have never annexed it or claimed it to\r\nbe part of the British Empire. We intervened in 1882 for the purpose of\r\nrestoring order, and five years later we offered to withdraw, and were\r\nonly prevented from carrying out our intention because the Sultan of\r\nTurkey declined, at the instigation of another Power, to sign the Firman\r\nwhich gave us the right of re-occupying the country if order should\r\nagain be disturbed. In the subsequent years we gave repeated assurances\r\nto Egyptians and to foreign Powers that we had no intention of altering\r\nthe status of the country as defined in its theoretical government by\r\nKhedive, Egyptian Ministers, and Egyptian Council or Assembly. And\r\nthough it was true that in virtue of the army of occupation we were in\r\nfact supreme, by leaving the forms of their government untouched and\r\nrefraining from all steps to legalise our position we reassured the\r\nEgyptians as to our ultimate objects.\r\n\r\nIn the eyes of the Egyptians the proclamation of the Protectorate and\r\nthe conversion of the \"Agent and Consul-General\" into a \"High\r\nCommissioner\" armed with the weapons of martial law seriously prejudiced\r\nthis situation, and though they acquiesced for the period of the war,\r\nthey were determined to have a settlement with us immediately it was\r\nover, and took us very seriously at our word when we promised to review\r\nthe whole situation when that time came. The truth about the\r\n\"Protectorate\" was that we adopted it as a way out of the legal\r\nentanglement which would otherwise have converted the Egyptians into\r\nenemy aliens when their suzerain, the Sultan of Turkey, entered the war\r\nagainst us, and we did it deliberately as the preferable alternative to\r\nannexing the country. But we have neither explained to the Egyptians nor\r\nmade clear to ourselves what exactly we meant by it, and in the absence\r\nof explanations it was interpreted in Egypt as a first step to the\r\nextinction of Egyptian nationality.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER-WAR MISTAKES\r\n\r\nHad we acted wisely and expeditiously at the end of the war we might\r\neven then have avoided the trouble that followed. But when Egyptian\r\nministers asked leave to come to London in December, 1918, we answered\r\nthat the time was not opportune for these discussions, and when the\r\nNationalist leaders proposed to send a delegation, we said that no good\r\npurpose could be served by their coming to Europe. This heightened the\r\nalarm, and the Nationalists retorted by raising their claims from\r\n\"complete autonomy\" to \"complete independence,\" and started a violent\r\nagitation. The Government retaliated by deporting Zaghlul to Malta,\r\nwhereupon the country broke into rebellion. Lord Allenby now came upon\r\nthe scene, and, while suppressing the rebellion, released Zaghlul and\r\ngave him and his delegation the permission to go to Europe which had\r\nbeen refused in January. It was now decided to send out the Milner\r\nMission, but there was a further delay of seven months before it\r\nstarted, and during all that time agitation continued.\r\n\r\nWhen the Mission arrived it quickly discovered that there was no\r\npossible \"Constitution under the Protectorate\" which would satisfy the\r\nEgyptians, and that the sole alternatives were further suppression or\r\nthe discovery of some means of settlement which dispensed with the\r\nProtectorate. The Mission unanimously came to the conclusion that though\r\nthe first was mechanically possible if the cost and discredit were\r\nfaced, the second was not only feasible but far preferable, and that the\r\nright method was a treaty of Alliance between Great Britain and Egypt,\r\nrecognising Egypt as a sovereign State, but affording all necessary\r\nguarantees for imperial interests. Working on those lines the Mission\r\ngradually broke down the boycott proclaimed against them, convinced the\r\nEgyptians of their goodwill, induced all parties of Egyptian\r\nNationalists to come to London, and there negotiated the basis of the\r\nTreaty which was described in the Report. The main points were that\r\nthere must be a British force in the country--not an army of occupation,\r\nbut a force to guard Imperial communications--that there must be British\r\nliaison officers for law and order and finance, that the control of\r\nforeign policy must remain in the hands of Great Britain, and that the\r\nSoudan settlement of 1898 must remain untouched, but that with these\r\nexceptions the Government of Egypt should be in fact what it had always\r\nbeen in theory: a Government of Egyptians by Egyptians.\r\n\r\nHad the Government accepted this in December, 1920 (instead of in March,\r\n1922), and instructed Lord Milner to go forward and draft a treaty on\r\nthis basis, it is extremely probable that a settlement would have been\r\nreached in a few weeks; but Ministers, unhappily, were unable to make up\r\ntheir minds, and there was a further delay of three months before the\r\nEgyptian Prime Minister, Adli Pasha, was invited to negotiate with the\r\nForeign Office. By this time the Nationalist parties which the Mission\r\nhad succeeded in uniting on a common platform had fallen apart, and the\r\nextremists once more started a violent agitation and upbraided the\r\nmoderates for tamely waiting on the British Government, which had\r\nevidently meant to deceive them. The situation had, therefore, changed\r\nagain for the worse when Adli came to London in April, 1921, and it was\r\nmade worse still by what followed. The negotiations dragged over six\r\nmonths, and finally broke down for reasons that have never been\r\nexplained, but the probability is that Egypt had now got entangled in\r\nCoalition domestic politics, and that the \"Die-Hards\" claimed to have\r\ntheir way in Egypt in return for their consent to the Irish settlement.\r\nThe door was now banged in the face of all schools of Egyptian\r\nNationalists, and Lord Allenby was instructed to send to the Sultan the\r\nunhappy letter in which Egypt was peremptorily reminded that she was a\r\n\"part of the communications of the British Empire,\" and many other\r\nthings said which were specially calculated to wound Egyptian\r\nsusceptibilities.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian Prime Minister resigned, and for the next five months Lord\r\nAllenby endeavoured to govern the country by martial law without an\r\nEgyptian Ministry. Then he came to London with the unanimous support of\r\nBritish officials in Egypt to tell the Government that the situation was\r\nimpossible and a settlement imperative. The Government gave way and\r\nBritish policy was again reversed, but three opportunities had now been\r\nthrown away, and at the fourth time of asking the difficulties were\r\ngreatly increased. The Nationalists were now divided and the Moderates\r\nin danger of being violently attacked if they accepted a moderate\r\nsolution. It was found necessary to deport Zaghlul Pasha and to put\r\nseveral of his chief adherents on trial. Suspicions had been aroused by\r\nthe delays and vacillations of the British Government. A settlement by\r\ntreaty was now impossible, and Lord Allenby had to give unconditionally\r\nthe recognition of sovereignty which the Mission intended to be part of\r\nthe treaty, putting the Egyptians under an honourable pledge to respect\r\nBritish rights and interests. In the circumstances there was nothing\r\nelse to do, but it is greatly to be desired that when the constitution\r\nhas been completed and the new Assembly convened, an effort should be\r\nmade to revert to the method of the treaty which particularly suited the\r\nEgyptian character and would be regarded as a binding obligation by\r\nEgyptians.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOPE OF THE FUTURE\r\n\r\nIn regard to the future, there is only one thing to do and that is to\r\nwork honestly to its logical conclusion the theory now adopted, that\r\nEgypt is a self-governing independent State. Egyptians must be\r\nencouraged to shoulder the full responsibilities of a self-governing\r\ncommunity. It would be folly to maintain a dual system which enabled an\r\nEgyptian Government to shunt the difficult or disagreeable part of its\r\ntask on to a British High Commissioner. Whatever the system of\r\nGovernment, there is no escape for either party from the most intimate\r\nmutual relations. Geography and circumstances decree them, but there is\r\nno necessary clash between the imperial interests which require us to\r\nguard the highway to the East that runs through Egyptian territory, and\r\nthe full exercise of their national rights by Egyptians. Egyptians must\r\nremember that for many years to come the world will hold us responsible\r\nfor law and order and solvency in Egypt, and we on our part must\r\nremember that Egyptians have the same pride in their country as other\r\npeoples, and that they will never consent to regard it as merely and\r\nprimarily \"a communication of the British Empire.\" In any wise solution\r\nof the question any sudden breach with the past will be avoided, and\r\nEgyptians will of their own free will enlist the aid of British\r\nofficials who have proved their devotion to the country by loyal and\r\nskilful service. The hope of the future lies in substituting a free\r\npartnership for a domination of one race by the other, and with a genial\r\nand good-humoured people, such as the Egyptians essentially are, there\r\nshould be no difficulty in restoring friendship and burying past\r\nanimosities. But there must be a real determination on both sides to\r\nmake Egyptian independence a success and no disposition on either to\r\ngive merely a reluctant consent to the conditions agreed upon by them\r\nand then to throw the onus of failure on the others.\r\n\r\nI deeply regret the schism between the different schools of Nationalists\r\nin Egypt. As we have seen in Ireland, Nationalism is threatened from\r\nwithin as well as from without, and it is a great misfortune that in\r\nsettling the Egyptian problem we missed the moment in 1920 when the\r\ndifferent Nationalist parties were all but united on a common platform.\r\nExtremist leaders have the power of compelling even their friends to\r\ndeport them and treat them as enemies, and I assume that Zaghlul put\r\nLord Allenby under this compulsion, when he decided that his deportation\r\nwas necessary. But Zaghlul was one of the few Nationalist leaders who\r\nwere of peasant origin, and his followers stand for something that needs\r\nto be strongly represented in the Government if it is not to take its\r\ncomplexion merely from the towns and the wealthy interests. The fellah\r\nis a very different man from what he was in the days of Ismail, and it\r\nis improbable that he will again submit to oppression as his forefathers\r\ndid but it is eminently desirable that there should be in the Government\r\nmen whom he would accept as leaders and whom he could trust to speak for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAbove all, it is to be hoped that, having conceded the independence of\r\nEgypt, we shall not slip back into governing the country by martial law\r\nwith the aid of one party among the Egyptians. That would be merely an\r\nevasion of the difficulty and a postponement of troubles. There are a\r\ngood many difficulties yet to be overcome, and the progress of events\r\nwill need careful watching by Liberals in and out of the House of\r\nCommons, but if at length we steer a straight course and bring political\r\ngood sense to the details of the problem, there is no reason why we\r\nshould not satisfy the Egyptians and put Anglo-Egyptian relations on a\r\ngood and enduring basis. In dealing with Egypt as with all Eastern\r\ncountries, it should constantly be borne in mind that manners,\r\ncharacter, and personality are a chief part of good politics. To a very\r\nlarge extent the estrangement has been caused by a failure to understand\r\nand respect the feelings of the Egyptian people, and here, as in India,\r\nit is important to understand that the demand of the Eastern man is not\r\nonly for self-government, but also for a new status which will enable\r\nhim to maintain his self-respect in his dealings with the West.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nBY RAMSAY MUIR\r\n\r\nProfessor of Modern History in the University of Manchester, 1913 to\r\n1921.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Ramsay Muir said:--One of the most marked, and one of the most\r\nominous, features of the political situation to-day is that there is an\r\nalmost universal decline of belief in and respect for our system of\r\ngovernment. This undermining of the confidence that a healthy community\r\nought to feel in its institutions is a perturbing fact which it is the\r\nplain duty of all good Liberals to consider seriously. We need not be\r\ndeterred by the old gibe that Liberalism has always cared more about\r\npolitical machinery than about social reorganisation. The gibe was never\r\ntrue. But, in any case, no projects of social reorganisation have much\r\nchance of success unless the political machinery by means of which they\r\nhave to be carried into effect is working efficiently. Moreover, since\r\nmost of the projects of social reform which are being urged upon our\r\nattention involve an enlargement of the activities of the State, it is\r\nobvious that we shall be running the risk of a breakdown unless we make\r\nsure that the machinery of the State is capable of meeting the demands\r\nwhich are made upon it. We must be satisfied that our engine has\r\nsufficient power before we require it to draw a double load. In truth,\r\none reason why the engine of government is not working well is that it\r\nhas been required to do a great deal more work than it was designed for.\r\nThe time has come to consider carefully the character and capacity of\r\nour machinery of government in view of the increased demands which are\r\ncertain to be made upon it in the future.\r\n\r\nOur national political system may be divided into two parts. On the one\r\nhand, there is the working machine, which goes on, year in, year out,\r\nwhether Parliament is sitting or not, and which would still go on quite\r\nwell for a time if Parliament never met again. We call it the\r\nGovernment, and we habitually and rightly hold it responsible for every\r\naspect of national policy and action, for legislation and finance as\r\nwell as for foreign policy and internal administration. On the other\r\nhand, there is what Burke used to call \"the control on behalf of the\r\nnation,\" mainly exercised through Parliament, whose chief function is to\r\ncriticise and control the action of Government, and to make the\r\nresponsibility of Government to the nation a real and a felt\r\nresponsibility. The discontents of to-day apply to both parts of the\r\nsystem, and I propose to deal with them in turn, first inquiring what is\r\nwrong with the working machine of government and how it can be amended,\r\nand then turning to consider how far the control on behalf of the nation\r\nis working badly, and how it can be made more efficient.\r\n\r\nIn what I have called the \"working machine\" of government there are two\r\ndistinct elements. First, there is the large, permanent, professional\r\nstaff, the Civil Service; secondly, there is the policy-directing body,\r\nthe Cabinet. Both of these are the objects of a great deal of\r\ncontemporary criticism. On the one hand, we are told that we are\r\nsuffering from \"bureaucracy,\" which means that the permanent officials\r\nhave too much independent and uncontrolled, or imperfectly controlled,\r\nauthority. On the other hand, we are told that we are suffering from\r\nCabinet dictatorship, or, alternatively, that the Cabinet system is\r\nbreaking down and being replaced by the autocracy of the Prime Minister.\r\nThere is a good deal of _prima facie_ justification for all these\r\ncomplaints.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GROWTH OF THE CIVIL SERVICE\r\n\r\nFirst, as to bureaucracy. It is manifest that there has been an immense\r\nincrease in the number, the functions, and the power of public\r\nofficials. This is not merely due to the war. It has been going on for a\r\nlong time--ever since, in fact, we began the deliberate process of\r\nnational reconstruction in the years following 1832. In itself this\r\nincrease has not been a bad thing; on the contrary, it has been the only\r\npossible means of carrying into effect the great series of reforms which\r\nmarked the nineteenth century. And may I here underline the fact that we\r\nLiberals, in particular, have no right to criticise the process, since\r\nwe have been mainly responsible for it, at any rate in all its early\r\nstages. When our predecessors set up the first Factory Inspectors in\r\n1833, and so rendered possible the creation of a whole code of factory\r\nlaws; when they created the first rudimentary Education Office in 1839,\r\nand so set to work the men who have really moulded our national system\r\nof education; when they set up a bureaucratic Poor Law Board in 1841,\r\nwhich shaped our Poor Law Policy, and a Public Health Board in 1848,\r\nwhich gradually worked out our system of Public Health--when they did\r\nthese things, they were beginning a process which has been carried\r\nfurther with every decade. If you like, they were laying the foundations\r\nof bureaucracy; but they were also creating the only machinery by which\r\nvast, beneficial and desperately needed measures of social reform could\r\nbe carried into effect.\r\n\r\nAnd there is yet another thing for which Liberalism must assume the\r\nresponsibility. When Gladstone instituted the Civil Service Commission\r\nin 1853, and the system of appointment by competitive examination in\r\n1870, he freed the Civil Service from the reputation for corruption and\r\ninefficiency which had clung to it; and he ensured that it should\r\nattract, as it has ever since done, much of the best intellect of the\r\nnation. But this very fact inevitably increased the influence of the\r\nCivil Service, and encouraged the expansion of its functions. If you put\r\na body of very able men in charge of a department of public service, it\r\nis certain that they will magnify their office, take a disproportionate\r\nview of its claims, and incessantly strive to increase its functions and\r\nits staff. This is not only natural, it is healthy--so long as the\r\nprocess is subjected to efficient criticism and control.\r\n\r\nBut the plain fact is that the control is inadequate. The vast machine\r\nof government has outgrown the power of the controlling mechanism.\r\n\r\nWe trust for the control of the immense bureaucratic machine, almost\r\nentirely to the presence, at the head of each department, of a political\r\nminister directly responsible to Parliament. We hold the minister\r\nresponsible for everything that happens in his office, and we regard\r\nthis ministerial responsibility as one of the keystones of our system.\r\nBut when we reflect that the minister is distracted by a multitude of\r\nother calls upon his time, and that he has to deal with officials who\r\nare generally his equals in ability, and always his superiors in special\r\nknowledge; when we realise how impossible it is that a tithe of the\r\nmultifarious business of a great department should come before him, and\r\nthat the business which does come before him comes with the\r\nrecommendations for action of men who know ten times more about it than\r\nhe does, it must be obvious that the responsibility of the minister must\r\nbe quite unreal, in regard to the normal working of the office. One\r\nthing alone he can do, and it is an important thing, quite big enough to\r\noccupy his attention. He can make sure that the broad policy of the\r\noffice, and its big new departures, are in accord with the ideas of the\r\nmajority in Parliament, and are co-ordinated, through the Cabinet, with\r\nthe policy of the other departments. That, indeed, is the true function\r\nof a minister; and if he tries to make his responsibility real beyond\r\nthat, he may easily neglect his main work. Beyond this consideration of\r\nbroad policy, I do not hesitate to say that the theory of ministerial\r\nresponsibility is not a check upon the growth of bureaucracy, but is\r\nrather the cover under which bureaucracy has grown up. For the position\r\nof the minister enables him, and almost compels him, to use his\r\ninfluence in Parliament for the purpose of diverting or minimising\r\nparliamentary criticism.\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHECK UPON BUREAUCRACY\r\n\r\nHow can this growth of inadequately controlled official power be\r\nchecked? Is it not apparent that this can only be done if a clear\r\ndistinction is drawn between the sphere of broad policy, in which the\r\nminister both can be and ought to be responsible, and the sphere of\r\nordinary administrative work for which the minister cannot be genuinely\r\nresponsible? If that distinction is accepted, it ought not to be\r\nimpossible for Parliament without undermining ministerial or cabinet\r\nresponsibility, to devise a means of making its control over the\r\nordinary working of the departments effective, through a system of\r\ncommittees or in other ways.\r\n\r\nThe current complaints of bureaucracy, however, are not directed mainly\r\nagainst the ineffectiveness of the machinery of control, but against the\r\nway in which public work is conducted by government officials--the\r\nformalism and red-tape by which it is hampered, the absence of\r\nelasticity and enterprise; and the methods of government departments are\r\noften compared, to their disadvantage, with those of business firms. But\r\nthe comparison disregards a vital fact. The primary function of a\r\ngovernment department is not creative or productive, but regulative. It\r\nhas to see that laws are exactly carried out, and that public funds are\r\nused for the precise purposes for which they were voted; and for this\r\nkind of work a good deal of red-tape is necessary. Moreover, it is\r\nessential that those who are charged with such functions should be above\r\nall suspicion of being influenced by fear or favour or the desire to\r\nmake profit; and for this purpose fixed salaries and security of tenure\r\nare essential.\r\n\r\nIn short, the fundamental principles upon which government departments\r\nare organised are right for the regulative functions which they\r\nprimarily exist to perform. But they are altogether wrong for creative\r\nand productive work, which demands the utmost elasticity, adaptability,\r\nand freedom for experiment. And it is just because the ordinary\r\nmachinery of government has been used on a large scale for this kind of\r\nwork that the outcry against bureaucracy has recently been so vehement.\r\nIt is not possible to imagine a worse method of conducting a great\r\nproductive enterprise than to put it under the control of an evanescent\r\nminister selected on political grounds, and supported by a body of men\r\nwhose work is carried on in accordance with the traditions of the Civil\r\nService.\r\n\r\nIf we are to avoid a breakdown of our whole system, we must abstain from\r\nplacing productive enterprises under the control of the ordinary\r\nmachinery of government--Parliament, responsible political ministers,\r\nand civil service staffs. But it does not follow that no productive\r\nconcern ought ever to be brought under public ownership and withdrawn\r\nfrom the sphere of private enterprise. As we shall later note, such\r\nconcerns can, if it be necessary, be organised in a way which would\r\navoid these dangers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CABINET\r\n\r\nWe turn next to the other element in the working machine of government,\r\nthe Cabinet, or policy-directing body, which is the very pivot of our\r\nwhole system. Two main functions fall to the Cabinet. In the first\r\nplace, it has to ensure an effective co-ordination between the various\r\ndepartments of government; in the second place, it is responsible for\r\nthe initiation and guidance of national policy in every sphere, subject\r\nto the watchful but friendly control of Parliament.\r\n\r\nLong experience has shown that there are several conditions which must\r\nbe fulfilled if a Cabinet is to perform these functions satisfactorily.\r\nIn the first place, its members must, among them, be able to speak for\r\nevery department of government; failing this, the function of\r\nco-ordination cannot be effectively performed. This principle was\r\ndiscarded in the later stages of the war, when a small War Cabinet was\r\ninstituted, from which most of the ministers were excluded. The result\r\nwas confusion and overlapping, and the attempt to remedy these evils by\r\nthe creation of a staff of _liaison_ officers under the control of the\r\nPrime Minister had very imperfect success, and in some respects only\r\nadded to the confusion. In the second place, the Cabinet must be\r\ncoherent and homogeneous, and its members must share the same ideals of\r\nnational policy. National business cannot be efficiently transacted if\r\nthe members of the Cabinet are under the necessity of constantly arguing\r\nabout, and making compromises upon, first principles. That is the\r\njustification for drawing the members of a Cabinet from the leaders of a\r\nsingle party, who think alike and understand one another's minds.\r\nWhenever this condition has been absent, confusion, vacillation and\r\ncontradiction have always marked the conduct of public affairs, and\r\ndisastrous results have followed.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, the procedure of the Cabinet must be intimate,\r\ninformal, elastic, and confidential; every member must be able to feel\r\nthat he has played his part in all the main decisions of policy, whether\r\nthey directly concern his department or not, and that he is personally\r\nresponsible for these decisions. Constitutional usage has always\r\nprescribed that it is the duty of a Cabinet Minister to resign if he\r\ndiffers from his colleagues on any vital matter, whether relating to his\r\ndepartment or not, and this usage is, in truth, the main safeguard for\r\nthe preservation of genuine conjoint responsibility, and the main\r\nbarrier against irresponsible action by a Prime Minister or a clique.\r\nWhen the practice of resignation in the sense of giving up office is\r\nreplaced by the other kind of resignation--shrugging one's shoulders and\r\nletting things slide--the main virtue of Cabinet government has been\r\nlost. In the fourth place, in order that every minister may fully share\r\nin every important discussion and decision, it is essential that the\r\nCabinet should be small. Sir Robert Peel, in whose ministry of 1841-6\r\nthe system probably reached perfection, laid it down that nine was the\r\nmaximum number for efficiency, because not more than about nine men can\r\nsit round a table in full view of one another, all taking a real share\r\nin every discussion. When the membership of a Cabinet largely exceeds\r\nthis figure, it is inevitable that the sense of joint and several\r\nresponsibility for every decision should be greatly weakened.\r\n\r\n\r\nMODERN CHANGES IN THE CABINET\r\n\r\nI do not think any one will deny that the Cabinet has in a large degree\r\nlost these four features which we have laid down as requisite for full\r\nefficiency. The process has been going on for a long time, but during\r\nthe last six years it has been accelerated so greatly that the Cabinet\r\nof to-day is almost unrecognisably different from what it was fifty\r\nyears ago. To begin with, it has grown enormously in size, owing to the\r\nincrease in the number of departments of government. This growth has\r\nmarkedly diminished the sense of responsibility for national policy as a\r\nwhole felt by the individual members, and the wholesome practice of\r\nresignation has gone out of fashion. It has led to frequent failures in\r\nthe co-ordination of the various departments, which are often seen\r\nworking at cross purposes. It has brought about a new formality in the\r\nproceedings of the Cabinet, in the establishment of a Cabinet\r\nSecretariat.\r\n\r\nThe lack of an efficient joint Cabinet control has encouraged a very\r\nmarked and unhealthy increase in the personal authority of the Prime\r\nMinister and of the clique of more intimate colleagues by whom he is\r\nsurrounded; and this is strengthened by the working of the new\r\nSecretariat. All these unhealthy features have been intensified by the\r\ncombination of the two strongest parties in Parliament to form a\r\ncoalition; for this has deprived the Cabinet of homogeneity and made it\r\nthe scene not of the definition of a policy guided by clear principles,\r\nbut rather the scene of incessant argument, bargaining, and compromise\r\non fundamentals. Finally, the responsibility of the Cabinet to\r\nParliament has been gravely weakened; it acts as the master of\r\nParliament, not as its agent, and its efficiency suffers from the fact\r\nthat its members are able to take their responsibility to Parliament\r\nvery lightly.\r\n\r\nAll these defects in the working of the Cabinet system have been much\r\nmore marked since the war than at any earlier time. But the two chief\r\namong them--lessened coherence due to unwieldiness of size, and\r\ndiminished responsibility to Parliament--were already becoming apparent\r\nduring the generation before the war. On the question of responsibility\r\nto Parliament we shall have something to say later. But it is worth\r\nwhile to ask whether there is any means whereby the old coherence,\r\nintimacy and community of responsibility can be restored. If it cannot\r\nbe restored, the Cabinet system, as we have known it, is doomed. I do\r\nnot think that it can be restored unless the size of the Cabinet can be\r\ngreatly reduced, without excluding from its deliberations a responsible\r\nspokesman for each department of government.\r\n\r\nBut this will only be possible if a considerable regrouping of the great\r\ndepartments can be effected. I do not think that such a regrouping is\r\nimpracticable. Indeed, it is for many reasons desirable. If it were\r\ncarried out, a Cabinet might consist of the following members, who would\r\namong them be in contact with the whole range of governmental activity.\r\nThere would be the Prime Minister; there would be the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer, responsible for national finance; there would be the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs; there would be a Minister for Imperial Affairs,\r\nspeaking for a sub-Cabinet which would include Secretaries for the\r\nDominions, for India, and for the Crown Colonies and Protectorates;\r\nthere would be a Minister of Defence, with a sub-Cabinet including\r\nMinisters of the Navy, the Army, and the Air Force; there would be a\r\nMinister for Justice and Police, performing most of the functions both\r\nof the Home Office and of the Lord Chancellor, who would cease to be a\r\npolitical officer and be able to devote himself to his judicial\r\nfunctions; there would be a Minister of Agriculture, Industry, and\r\nCommerce, with a sub-Cabinet representing the Board of Trade, the Board\r\nof Agriculture, the Ministry of Mines, the Ministry of Labour, and\r\nperhaps other departments.\r\n\r\nMinisters of Public Health and of Education would complete the list of\r\nactive administrative chiefs; but one or two additional members, not\r\nburdened with the charge of a great department might be added, such as\r\nthe Lord President of the Council, and one of these might very properly\r\nbe a standing representative upon the Council of the League of Nations.\r\nThe heads of productive trading departments--the Post Office and the\r\nPublic Works Department--should, I suggest, be excluded from the\r\nCabinet, and their departments should be separately organised in such a\r\nway as not to involve a change of personnel when one party succeeded\r\nanother in power. These departments have no direct concern with the\r\ndetermination of national policy.\r\n\r\nOn such a scheme we should have a Cabinet of nine or ten members,\r\nrepresenting among them all the departments which are concerned with\r\nregulative or purely governmental work. And I suggest that a\r\nrearrangement of this kind would not only restore efficiency to the\r\nCabinet, but would lead to very great administrative reforms, better\r\nco-ordination between closely related departments, and in many respects\r\neconomy. But valuable as such changes may be, they would not in\r\nthemselves be sufficient to restore complete health to our governmental\r\nsystem. In the last resort this depends upon the organisation of an\r\nefficient and unresting system of criticism and control.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE OF COMMONS\r\n\r\nIn any modern State the control of the action of Government is largely\r\nwielded by organs not formally recognised by law--by the general\r\nmovement of public opinion; by the influence of what is vaguely called\r\n\"the city\"; by the resolutions of such powerful bodies as trade union\r\ncongresses, federations of employers, religious organisations, and\r\npropagandist bodies of many kinds; and, above all, by the Press. No\r\nreview of our system would be complete without some discussion of these\r\nextremely powerful and in some cases dangerous influences. We cannot,\r\nhowever, touch upon them here. We must confine ourselves to the formal,\r\nconstitutional machinery of national control over the actions of\r\nGovernment, that is, to Parliament, as the spokesman of the nation.\r\n\r\nAn essential part of any full discussion of this subject would be a\r\ntreatment of the Second Chamber problem. But that would demand a whole\r\nhour to itself; and I propose to pass it over for the present, and to\r\nask you to consider the perturbing fact that the House of Commons, which\r\nis the very heart of our system, has largely lost the confidence and\r\nbelief which it once commanded.\r\n\r\nWhy has the House of Commons lost the confidence of the nation? There\r\nare two main reasons, which we must investigate in turn. In the first\r\nplace, in spite of the now completely democratic character of the\r\nelectorate, the House is felt to be very imperfectly representative of\r\nthe national mind. And in the second place, it is believed to perform\r\nvery inefficiently its primary function of criticising and controlling\r\nthe action of Government.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, why do men vaguely feel that the House of Commons is\r\nunrepresentative? I think there are three main reasons. The first is to\r\nbe found in the method of election. Since 1885 the House has been\r\nelected by equal electoral districts, each represented by a single\r\nmember. Now, if we suppose that every constituency was contested by two\r\ncandidates only, about 45 per cent. of the voters must feel that they\r\nhad not voted for anybody who sat at Westminster; while many of the\r\nremaining 55 per cent. must feel that they had been limited to a choice\r\nbetween two men, neither of whom truly represented them. But if in many\r\nconstituencies there are no contests, and in many others there are three\r\nor more candidates, the number of electors who feel that they have not\r\nvoted for any member of the House may rise to 60 per cent. or even 70\r\nper cent. of the total.\r\n\r\nThe psychological effect of this state of things must be profound. And\r\nthere is another consideration. The very name of the House of Commons\r\n(Communes, not common people) implies that it represents organised\r\ncommunities, with a character and personality and tradition of their\r\nown--boroughs or counties. So it did until 1885. Now it largely\r\nrepresents totally unreal units which exist only for the purpose of the\r\nelection. The only possible means of overcoming these defects\r\nof the single member system is some mode of proportional\r\nrepresentation--perhaps qualified by the retention of single members in\r\nthose boroughs or counties which are just large enough to be entitled to\r\none member.\r\n\r\nThe main objection taken to proportional representation is that it would\r\nprobably involve small and composite majorities which would not give\r\nsufficient authority to ministries. But our chief complaint is that the\r\nauthority of modern ministries is too great, their power too unchecked.\r\nIn the middle of the nineteenth century, when our system worked most\r\nsmoothly, parties _were_ composite, and majorities were small--as they\r\nusually ought to be, if the real balance of opinion in the country is to\r\nbe reflected. The result was that the control of Parliament over the\r\nCabinet was far more effective than it is to-day; the Cabinet could not\r\nride roughshod over the House; and debates really influenced votes, as\r\nthey now scarcely ever do. The immense majorities which have been the\r\nrule since 1885 are not healthy. They are the chief cause of the growth\r\nof Cabinet autocracy. And they are due primarily to the working of the\r\nsingle-member constituency.\r\n\r\nThe second ground of distrust is the belief that Parliament is unduly\r\ndominated by party; that its members cannot speak and vote freely; that\r\nthe Cabinet always gets its way because it is able to hold over members,\r\n_in terrorem_, the threat of a general election, which means a fine of\r\n£1000 a head; and that (what creates more suspicion than anything) the\r\npolicy of parties is unduly influenced by the subscribers of large\r\namounts to secret party funds. I am a profound believer in organised\r\nparties as essential to the working of our system. But I also believe\r\nthat there is real substance in these complaints, though they are often\r\nexaggerated. What is the remedy? First, smaller majorities, and a\r\ngreater independence of the individual member, which would follow from a\r\nchange in the methods of election. And, secondly, publicity of accounts\r\nin regard to party funds. There is no reason why an honest party should\r\nbe ashamed of receiving large gifts for the public ends it serves, and\r\nevery reason why it should be proud of receiving a multitude of small\r\ngifts. I very strongly hold that in politics, as in industry, the best\r\nsafeguard against dishonest dealings, and the surest means of restoring\r\nconfidence, is to be found in the policy of \"Cards on the table.\" Is\r\nthere any reason why we Liberals should not begin by boldly adopting, in\r\nour own case, this plainly Liberal policy?\r\n\r\n\r\nREPRESENTATION OF \"INTERESTS\"\r\n\r\nThere is a third reason for dissatisfaction with the composition of the\r\nHouse of Commons, which has become more prominent in recent years. It is\r\nthat, increasingly, organised interests are making use of the\r\ndeficiencies of our electoral system to secure representation for\r\nthemselves. If I may take as instances two men whom, in themselves,\r\neverybody would recognise as desirable members of the House, Mr. J.H.\r\nThomas plainly is, and is bound to think of himself as, a representative\r\nof the railwaymen rather than of the great community of Derby, while Sir\r\nAllan Smith as plainly represents engineering employers rather than\r\nCroydon. There used to be a powerful trade which chose as its motto \"Our\r\ntrade is our politics.\" Most of us have regarded that as an unsocial\r\ndoctrine, yet the growing representation of interests suggests that it\r\nis being widely adopted.\r\n\r\nIndeed, there are some who contend that we ought frankly to accept this\r\ndevelopment and universalise it, basing our political organisation upon\r\nwhat they describe (in a blessed, Mesopotamic phrase) as \"functional\r\nrepresentation.\" The doctrine seems to have, for some minds, a strange\r\nplausibility. But is it not plain that it could not be justly carried\r\nout? Who could define or enumerate the \"functions\" that are to be\r\nrepresented? If you limit them to economic functions (as, in practice,\r\nthe advocates of this doctrine do), will you provide separate\r\nrepresentation, for example, for the average-adjusters--a mere handful\r\nof men, who nevertheless perform a highly important function? But you\r\ncannot thus limit functions to the economic sphere without distorting\r\nyour representation of the national mind and will. If you represent\r\nminers merely as miners, you misrepresent them, for they are also\r\nBaptists or Anglicans, dog-fanciers, or lovers of Shelley,\r\nprize-fighters, or choral singers. The notion that you can represent the\r\nmind of the nation on a basis of functions is the merest moonshine. The\r\nmost you can hope for is to get a body of 700 men and women who will\r\nform a sort of microcosm of the more intelligent mind of the nation, and\r\ntrust to it to control your Government. Such a body will consist of men\r\nwho follow various trades. But the conditions under which they are\r\nchosen ought to be such as to impress upon them the duty of thinking of\r\nthe national interest as a whole in the first instance, and of their\r\ntrade interests only as they are consistent with that. The fundamental\r\ndanger of functional representation is that it reverses this principle,\r\nand impresses upon the representative the view that his trade is his\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nBut it is useless to deplore or condemn a tendency unless you see how it\r\ncan be checked. Why has this representation of economic interests become\r\nso strong? Because Parliament is the arena in which important industrial\r\nproblems are discussed and settled. It is not a very good body for that\r\npurpose. If we had a National Industrial Council charged, not with the\r\nfinal decision, but with the most serious and systematic discussion of\r\nsuch problems, they would be more wisely dealt with. And, what is quite\r\nas important, such a body would offer precisely the kind of sphere\r\nwithin which the representation of interests as such would be altogether\r\nwholesome and useful; and, once it became the main arena of discussion,\r\nit would satisfy the demand for interest-representation, which is\r\nundermining the character of Parliament. In other words, the true\r\nalternative to functional representation in Parliament is functional\r\ndevolution under the supreme authority of Parliament.\r\n\r\nBut still more important than the dissatisfaction aroused by the\r\ncomposition of the House is the dissatisfaction which is due to the\r\nbelief that its functions are very inefficiently performed. It is\r\nwidely believed that, instead of controlling Government, Parliament is\r\nin fact controlled by it. The truth is that the functions imposed upon\r\nParliament by increased legislative activity and the growth of the\r\nsphere of Government are so vast and multifarious that no part of them\r\n_can_ be adequately performed in the course of sessions of reasonable\r\nlength; and if the sessions are not of reasonable length--already they\r\nare too long--we shall be deprived of the services of many types of men\r\nwithout whom the House would cease to be genuinely representative of the\r\nmind of the nation.\r\n\r\nConsider how the three main functions of Parliament are\r\nperformed--legislation, finance, and the control of administration. The\r\ndiscussion of legislation by the whole House has been made to seem\r\nfutile by the crack of the party whip, by obstruction, and by the\r\nweapons designed to deal with obstruction--the closure, the guillotine,\r\nthe kangaroo. A real amendment has been brought about in this sphere by\r\nthe establishment of a system of committees to which legislative\r\nproposals of various kinds are referred, and this is one of the most\r\nhopeful features of recent development. But there is still one important\r\nsphere of legislation in which drastic reform is necessary: the costly\r\nand cumbrous methods of dealing with private bills promoted by\r\nmunicipalities or by railways and other public companies. It is surely\r\nnecessary that the bulk of this work should be devolved upon subordinate\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\nWhen we pass to finance, the inefficiency of parliamentary control\r\nbecomes painfully clear. It is true that a good deal of parliamentary\r\ntime is devoted to the discussion of the estimates. But how much of this\r\ntime is given to motions to reduce the salary of the Foreign Secretary\r\nby £100 in order to call attention to what is happening in China?\r\nParliament never, in fact, attempts any searching analysis of the\r\nexpenditure in this department or that. It cannot do so, because the\r\nnational accounts are presented in a form which makes such discussion\r\nvery difficult. The establishment of an Estimates Committee is an\r\nadvance. But even an Estimates Committee cannot do such work without the\r\naid of a whole series of special bodies intimately acquainted with the\r\nworking of various departments. In short, the House of Commons has\r\nlargely lost control over national expenditure. As for the control of\r\nadministration, we have already seen how inadequate that is, and why it\r\nis inadequate.\r\n\r\nThese deficiencies must be corrected if Parliament is to regain its\r\nprestige, and if our system of government is to attain real efficiency.\r\nFor this purpose two things are necessary: in the first place,\r\nsubstantial changes in the procedure of Parliament; in the second place,\r\nthe delegation to subordinate bodies of such powers as can be\r\nappropriately exercised by them without impairing the supreme authority\r\nof Parliament as the mouthpiece of the nation. I cannot here attempt to\r\ndiscuss these highly important matters in any detail. In regard to\r\nprocedure, I can only suggest that the most valuable reform would be the\r\ninstitution of a series of committees each concerned with a different\r\ndepartment of Government. The function of these committees would be to\r\ninvestigate and criticise the organisation and normal working of the\r\ndepartments, not to deal with questions of broad policy; for these ought\r\nto be dealt with in relation to national policy as a whole, and they\r\nmust, therefore, be the concern of the minister and of the Cabinet,\r\nsubject to the overriding authority of Parliament as a whole. In order\r\nto secure that this distinction is maintained, and in order to avoid the\r\ndefects of the French committee system under which independent\r\n_rapporteurs_ disregard and override the authority of the ministers, and\r\nthus gravely undermine their responsibility, it would be necessary not\r\nonly that each committee should include a majority of supporters of\r\nGovernment, but that the chair should be occupied by the minister or his\r\ndeputy.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVOLUTION\r\n\r\nNor can I stop to dwell upon the very important subject of the\r\ndelegation or devolution of powers by Parliament to subordinate bodies.\r\nI will only say that devolution may be, and I think ought to be, of two\r\nkinds, which we may define as regional and functional. To regional\r\nbodies for large areas (which might either be directly elected or\r\nconstituted by indirect election from the local government authorities\r\nwithin each area) might be allotted much of the legislative power of\r\nParliament in regard to private Bills, together with general control\r\nover those public functions, such as Education and Public Health, which\r\nare now mainly in the hands of local authorities. Of functional\r\ndevolution the most important expression would be the establishment of a\r\nNational Industrial Council and of a series of councils or boards for\r\nvarious industries endowed with quasi-legislative authority; by which I\r\nmean that they should be empowered by statute to draft proposals for\r\nlegislation of a defined kind, which would ultimately receive their\r\nvalidity from Parliament, perhaps without necessarily passing through\r\nthe whole of the elaborate process by which ordinary legislation is\r\nenacted. I believe there are many who share my conviction that a\r\ndevelopment in this direction represents the healthiest method of\r\nintroducing a real element of industrial self-government. But for the\r\nmoment we are concerned with it as a means of relieving Parliament from\r\nsome very difficult functions which Parliament does not perform\r\nconspicuously well, without qualifying its supreme and final authority.\r\n\r\nOne final point. If it is true, as I have argued, that the decay of the\r\nprestige and efficiency of Parliament is due to the fact that it is\r\nalready overloaded with functions and responsibilities, it must be\r\nobvious that to add to this burden the responsibility for controlling\r\nthe conduct of great industries, such as the railways and the mines,\r\nwould be to ensure the breakdown of our system of government, already on\r\nthe verge of dislocation. In so far as it may be necessary to undertake\r\non behalf of the community the ownership and conduct of any great\r\nindustrial or commercial concern, I submit that it is essential that it\r\nshould not be brought under the direct control of a ministerial\r\ndepartment responsible to Parliament. Yet the ultimate responsibility\r\nfor the right conduct of any such undertaking (_e.g._ the telephones,\r\nelectric supply, or forests) must, when it is assumed by the State, rest\r\nupon Parliament. How is this ultimate responsibility to be met? Surely\r\nin the way in which it is already met in the case of the Ecclesiastical\r\nCommissioners or the Port of London Authority--by setting up, under an\r\nAct of Parliament, an appropriate body in each case, and by leaving to\r\nit a large degree of freedom of action, subject to the terms of the Act\r\nand to the inalienable power of Parliament to alter the Act. In such a\r\ncase the Act could define how the authority should be constituted, on\r\nwhat principles its functions should be performed, and how its profits,\r\nif it made profits, should be distributed. And I suggest that there is\r\nno reason why the Post Office itself should not be dealt with in this\r\nway.\r\n\r\nIt is only a fleeting and superficial survey which I have been able to\r\ngive of the vast and complex themes on which I have touched; and there\r\nis no single one of them with which I have been able to deal fully. My\r\npurpose has been to show that in the political sphere as well as in the\r\nsocial and economic spheres vast tasks lie before Liberalism, and,\r\nindeed, that our social and economic tasks are not likely to be\r\nefficiently performed unless we give very serious thought to the\r\npolitical problem. Among the heavy responsibilities which lie upon our\r\ncountry in the troubled time upon which we are entering, there is none\r\nmore heavy than the responsibility which rests upon her as the pioneer\r\nof parliamentary government--the responsibility of finding the means\r\nwhereby this system may be made a respected and a trustworthy instrument\r\nfor the labours of reconstruction that lie before us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE AND INDUSTRY\r\n\r\nBY W.T. LAYTON\r\n\r\nM.A., C.H., C.B.E.; Editor of the _Economist_, 1922; formerly Member of\r\nMunitions Council, and Director of Economic and Financial Section of the\r\nLeague of Nations; Director of Welwyn Garden City; Fellow of Gonville\r\nand Caius College, Cambridge, 1910.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Layton said:--The existing system of private enterprise has been\r\nseriously attacked on many grounds. For my present purpose I shall deal\r\nwith four: (1) The critic points to the extreme differences of wealth\r\nand poverty which have emerged from this system of private enterprise;\r\n(2) it has produced and is producing to-day recurrent periods of\r\ndepression which result in insecurity and unemployment for the worker;\r\n(3) the critics say the system is producing great aggregations of\r\ncapital and monopolies, and that by throwing social power into the hands\r\nof those controlling the capital of the country, it leads to\r\nexploitation of the many by industrial and financial magnates; (4) it\r\nproduces a chronic state of internal war which saps industrial activity\r\nand the economic life of the community.\r\n\r\nI shall not attempt to minimise the force of these objections; but in\r\norder to get our ideas into correct perspective it should be observed\r\nthat the first two of these features are not new phenomena arising out\r\nof our industrial system. You find extreme inequalities of distribution\r\nin practically all forms of society--in the slave state, the feudal\r\nstate, in India and in China to-day. Nor is this the first period of\r\nhistory in which there has been insecurity. If you look at any primitive\r\ncommunity, and note the effect of harvest fluctuations and the\r\ninevitable famine following upon them, you will recognise that the\r\nvariations of fortune which affect such communities are more disastrous\r\nin their effect than the trade variations of the modern world.\r\n\r\nBut after all qualifications have been made these four indictments are\r\nsufficiently serious and must be met, for it is these and similar\r\nconsiderations which have driven many to desire the complete abolition\r\nof the system. Some wish to abolish private property, and desire a\r\nCommunist solution. Others practically attack the system of private\r\nenterprise, and wish to substitute either the community in some form or\r\nanother (_e.g._ state socialism), or some corporate form of industry\r\n(_e.g._ guild socialism).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIBERAL BIAS\r\n\r\nLiberals, on the other hand, reject these solutions, and desire not to\r\nend the present system but to mend it. The grounds for this conclusion\r\nneed to be clearly expressed, for after all it is the fundamental point\r\nof doctrine which distinguishes them from the Labour party. In the first\r\nplace, there is the fact that Liberals attach a special importance to\r\nthe liberty of the individual. The general relation of the individual\r\nto the State is rather outside my subject, but we start from the fact\r\nthat the bias of Liberals is towards liberty in every sphere, on the\r\nground that spiritual and intellectual progress is greatest where\r\nindividuality is least restricted by authority or convention. Variety,\r\noriginality in thought and action, are the vital virtues for the\r\nLiberal. It is still true that \"in this age the mere example of\r\nNonconformity, the mere refusal to bow the knee to custom, is itself a\r\nservice.\" The Liberal who no longer feels at the bottom of his heart a\r\nsympathy with the rebel who chafes against the institutions of society,\r\nwhether religious, political, social or economic, is well on the road to\r\nthe other camp. But the dynamic force of Liberty, that great motive\r\npower of progress, though a good servant, may be a bad master; and the\r\nperennial problem of society is to harmonise its aims with those of the\r\ncommon good.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to the more specific problem of industry, which is our\r\nimmediate concern, a glance at history shows that the era of most rapid\r\neconomic progress the world has ever seen has been the era of the\r\ngreatest freedom of the individual from statutory control in economic\r\naffairs. The features of the last hundred years have been the rapidity\r\nof development in industrial technique, and constant change in the form\r\nof industrial organisation and in the direction of the world's trade.\r\nCould any one suppose that in these respects industry, under the\r\ncomplete control of the State or of corporations representing large\r\ngroups of wage earners and persons engaged in trade, could have\r\nproduced a sufficiently elastic system to have permitted that progress\r\nto be made? In reply to this it may be said that though this was true\r\nduring the industrial revolution, it does not apply to-day; that our\r\nindustries have become organised; that methods of production,\r\npopulation, and economic conditions generally are stabilised, and that\r\nwe can now settle down to a new and standard form of industrial\r\norganisation. But this agreement is based on false premises. The\r\nindustrial revolution is far from complete. We are to-day in the full\r\nflood of it. Look at the changes in the last four decades--the evolution\r\nof electricity, the development of motor transport, or the discoveries\r\nin the chemical and metallurgical industries. Consider what lies ahead;\r\nthe conquest of the air, the possible evolution of new sources of power,\r\nand a hundred other phases which are opening up in man's conquest of\r\nnature, and you will agree that we are still at the threshold of\r\nindustrial revolution.\r\n\r\nI may mention here a consideration which applies practically to Great\r\nBritain. We are a great exporting country, living by international\r\ntrade, the world's greatest retail shopkeeper whose business is\r\nconstantly changing in character and direction. The great structure of\r\ninternational commerce on which our national life depends is essentially\r\na sphere in which elasticity is of the utmost importance, and in which\r\nstandardised or stereotyped methods of control of production or exchange\r\nwould be highly disastrous. Liberal policy, therefore, aims at keeping\r\nthe field of private enterprise in business as wide as possible. But in\r\nthe general discussion of political or personal liberty in economic\r\naffairs, we have to consider how far and in what way the freedom of\r\nprivate enterprise needs to be limited or curtailed for the common good.\r\nWe must solve that problem. For Liberals there is no inherent sanctity\r\nin the conceptions of private property, or of private enterprise. They\r\nwill survive, and we can support them only so long as they appear to\r\nwork better in the public interest than any possible alternatives.\r\n\r\n\r\nRETROSPECT AND PROSPECT\r\n\r\nMy object, then, is to show how a system which embodies a large amount\r\nof private enterprise can be made tolerable and acceptable to modern\r\nideas of equity. For this purpose we need to consider (1) what have we\r\ndone in that direction in the past? (2) what is the setting of the\r\neconomic problem to-day, and (3) what is to be our policy for the\r\nfuture?\r\n\r\nDealing first with wealth and wages, the whole field of social\r\nlegislation has a bearing upon them, including particularly education,\r\nelementary and technical, the Factory Acts, and a great mass of\r\nlegislation which has affected the earning powers of the worker and the\r\nconditions under which he labours. Just before the war we had come to\r\nthe point of fixing a minimum wage in the mines, but an even more\r\nimportant factor was that we had introduced the Trade Board system,\r\nwhich had begun to impose a minimum wage in certain trades where wages\r\nwere particularly low. But the most important direct attack upon the\r\nunequal distribution of wealth was by taxation in accordance with the\r\nLiberal policy of a graduated and differential income-tax, and still\r\nmore important by taxes upon inheritance; for it has long been\r\nrecognised that though it may be desirable to allow men to accumulate\r\ngreat wealth during their lifetime, it by no means follows that they\r\nshould be entitled to control the distribution of wealth in the next\r\ngeneration and launch their children on the world with a great advantage\r\nover their fellows of which they may be quite unworthy. On the question\r\nof insecurity it cannot be said that any serious attack has been made on\r\nthe problem of how to diminish fluctuations of trade, but again the\r\nLiberal solution for dealing with that difficulty was to remedy not the\r\ncause but its effects by insurance.\r\n\r\nOn the question of monopolies and exploitation, though we hear a great\r\ndeal of the growth of capitalistic organisation, in fact we find that,\r\nof the three greatest industrial countries in the world, Great Britain\r\nis the least trust-ridden, mainly because of its free trade system. In\r\nthe case of enterprises not subject to foreign competition, we had begun\r\nto develop a fairly satisfactory system of control of public utility\r\nservices which were of a monopolistic character.\r\n\r\nFinally, there had been growing up a complete system of collective\r\nbargaining and conciliation, and though we always heard of it whenever\r\nthere was dispute and strife, the ordinary public did not know that this\r\nmachinery was working and developing in many great and important\r\nindustries a feeling of co-operation or at all events of conciliation\r\nbetween the two sides. I only mention these points very briefly in\r\npassing in order to show that with the evolution of modern industry we\r\nwere already feeling our way, haltingly and far too slowly, it is true,\r\ntowards a solution of its most serious defects.\r\n\r\nTurning to the present situation, we have to face the fact that Great\r\nBritain is to-day faced with one of the most serious positions in its\r\neconomic history. We must make allowances for the readily understood\r\npessimism of a miners' leader, but it should arrest attention that Mr.\r\nFrank Hodges has recently described the present situation as the coming\r\nof the great famine in England. For nearly two decades before the war\r\nthere was occurring a slight fall in the real wages of British\r\nworkpeople. Food was becoming dearer, as the world's food supply was not\r\nincreasing as fast as the world's industrial population, and the\r\nindustrial workers of the world had, therefore, to offer more of their\r\nproduct to secure the food they needed. Hence the cost of living was\r\nrising faster than wages, except in trades where great technical\r\nadvances were being made. There is some reason to fear that the war may\r\nhave accentuated this tendency.\r\n\r\nFor some years the distant countries of the world have had to do without\r\nEuropean manufactured goods. You are all aware of the tendency, for\r\nexample, of India, Australia, and Canada to develop their own steel\r\nresources and to create manufacturing industries of all kinds. Moreover,\r\nwe have lost part of our hold on the food-producing countries of the\r\nworld by the sale of our capital investments in those countries to pay\r\nfor the war. These and other considerations all suggest that we may find\r\nit increasingly difficult to maintain our position as one of the main\r\nsuppliers of the manufactured goods of the world. In such circumstances\r\nwe shall be hard put to it to maintain, far less raise, the pre-war\r\nstandard of living.\r\n\r\nHow then are we to cope with this problem of retaining our economic\r\nposition? We can only hope to do it if the present financial\r\ndifficulties and obstructions working through the exchanges, by which\r\ninternational commerce is restricted and constrained, are removed. We\r\ncan only do it if and so long as the conception of international\r\ndivision of labour is maintained. And we can only do it if--granted that\r\nwe can induce the world to accept this principle of international\r\ndivision of labour--we can prove ourselves, by our economic and\r\nproductive efficiency, to be the best and cheapest producer of those\r\nclasses of goods in which our skilled labour and fixed capital is\r\ninvested.\r\n\r\nAssuming the financial difficulty is overcome, and that the old régime\r\nof international specialisation revives, can we still show to the world\r\nthat it is more profitable for them to buy goods and services from us\r\nthan from other people? Can we compete with other industrial countries\r\nof the world? The actual output of our labour in most cases is far less\r\nthan its potential capacity, partly because of technical conservatism,\r\nand partly for reasons connected with the labour situation. How are we\r\nto mobilise these reserve resources. I have only space to deal with the\r\nsecond of these problems. In Germany labour is well disciplined, and has\r\nthe military virtues of persistence and obedience to orders in the\r\nfactory. But we cannot hope to call forth the utmost product of our\r\nlabouring population by drill-sergeant methods.\r\n\r\nIn America this problem is a different one, because the American\r\nemployer is often able to take full advantage of his economic position.\r\nFor he has a labouring population of mixed nationality, which does not\r\nreadily combine, and he can play off one section against the other.\r\nBritish employers cannot, if they would, deal with British labour on the\r\nprinciple of Divide and Rule. There is only one method by which we can\r\nhope to call forth this great reserve capacity of British labour, and\r\nthat is by securing its confidence. If Free Trade is one of the legs on\r\nwhich British prosperity rests, the other is goodwill and active\r\nco-operation between the workman and his employer. How is that goodwill\r\nto be gained?\r\n\r\nThe solution of that problem is only partly in the hands of the\r\npolitician; that is one of the reasons why it is extremely difficult to\r\nsuggest an industrial policy which is going to hold out the hope of\r\nreaching Utopia in a short time. But it is obviously essential somehow\r\nor another to develop, particularly among employers, the sense of\r\ntrusteeship--the sense that a man who controls a large amount of capital\r\nis in fact not merely an individual pursuing his own fortune, but is\r\ntaking the very great responsibility of controlling a fragment of the\r\nnation's industrial resources. And we have also to develop a conception\r\nof partnership and joint enterprise between employer and employed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE OWNERSHIP: FOR AND AGAINST\r\n\r\nWhat policy in the political field can be adopted to further these\r\nobjects? Reverting once more to the fourfold division which I made at\r\nthe outset, but taking the points in a different order, there is first\r\nthe question whether there should be a great extension of State\r\nownership, management, or control of monopolies and big business. In\r\nspite of the experience of the war, I suggest tentatively that no case\r\nhas been made out for any wide or general extension of the field of\r\nState management in industry. This, however, is not a matter of\r\nprinciple, but of expediency, where each case must be considered on its\r\nmerits. Liberals should, indeed, keep an open mind in this connection\r\nand not be afraid to face an enlargement of the field of State\r\nmanagement from time to time. There are, however, two special cases to\r\nbe considered: the mines and the railways. As to the mines, the solution\r\nMr. McNair puts forward is on characteristically Liberal lines, because\r\nit will endeavour to harmonise the safeguarding of the interests of the\r\nState with the maximum freedom to private enterprise and the maximum\r\nscope for variety in methods of management. As to transport, we have\r\nrecently passed an Act altering the form of control of British railways.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think the question whether railways should or should not\r\nbe nationalised is very much on the balance. It is obviously one of the\r\nquestions where objections to State management are less serious than in\r\nmost other cases. On the other hand, we may be able to find methods of\r\ncontrol which may be even better than State management. I do not think\r\nthe Act of last year fulfils the conditions which Liberals would have\r\nimposed on the railways, for the principle of guaranteeing to a monopoly\r\na fixed income practically without any means of securing its efficiency,\r\nis the wrong way to control a public utility service. If we are going to\r\nleave public utilities in the hands of private enterprise, the principle\r\nmust be applied that profit should vary in proportion to the services\r\nrendered to the community. In this connection the old gas company\r\nprinciple developed before the war is an admirable one. Under it the gas\r\ncompanies were allowed to increase their dividends in proportion as they\r\nlowered their prices to the community. That is a key principle, and some\r\nadaptation of it is required wherever such services are left in private\r\nhands. My own view is that an amended form of railway control should\r\nfirst be tried, and if that fails we should be prepared for some form of\r\nnationalisation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRUSTS AND MONOPOLIES\r\n\r\nBut if we refuse at present to enlarge the sphere of State management,\r\nwe are still faced with the problem of dealing with trusts and\r\nmonopolies. In this matter, as in so many other instances, the right\r\npolicy has already been worked out. Under the stimulating conditions\r\nwhich obtained during the war, when old-established methods of thought\r\nhad been rudely shaken, progressive ideas had unusually free play; and\r\nyou will find in the general economic policy adumbrated during and\r\nimmediately after the war much that Liberals are looking for. On this\r\nquestion of monopolies, we should put into force the recommendation of\r\nthe Committee on Trusts of 1919, with one qualification. The policy I\r\nsuggest is the policy of the majority, namely, that we should give very\r\nmuch enlarged powers of inquiry to the Board of Trade, and that a\r\nTribunal should be set up by which investigations could be made. But I\r\nwould go further, and, taking one item from the Minority Report, I would\r\nadd that either to this Tribunal or to the Board of Trade department\r\nconcerned there should be given in reserve the power in special cases to\r\nregulate prices. I do not think it would be necessary often to use that\r\npower, indeed the mere inquiry and publicity of results would be\r\nsufficient to modify the action of monopolies. But such a power in\r\nreserve, even though price-fixing in ordinary circumstances is usually\r\nmischievous and to be deprecated, would have a very salutary effect.\r\n\r\nIn the case of public utilities of a standard kind, into which the\r\nelement of buying and selling profits does not greatly enter, we should\r\nendeavour to start the experiment of putting representatives of the\r\nworkpeople on the boards of directors, but in carefully selected cases,\r\nand not as a general rule. My own view is that if we are ready with the\r\nmachinery of investigation, and are prepared to deal in these ways with\r\npublic utilities at home where foreign competition is absent, we have\r\nlittle to fear from trusts.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nAs regards distribution and wages, in the first place we should adhere\r\nto our traditional policy, developing the system of differential and\r\ngraduated taxation, and we should be prepared, if unequal distribution\r\nof wealth continues, to limit further the right of inheritance. This is\r\nnot a new Liberal doctrine: it is many decades old. On the question of\r\nwages we have to recognise that unless we can secure an increase in\r\nterms of food and other commodities of the national production the State\r\ncannot radically modify the general standard of living in the country;\r\nor by administrative action raise the level of wages which economic\r\nconditions are imposing on us. But the State can and should enforce a\r\nminimum in certain industries, provided that minimum is reasonably in\r\nharmony with the competitive level of wages. Such action can prevent\r\nworkers whose economic position is not a strong one--and this applies\r\nparticularly to many women's employment--from being compelled to accept\r\nwages substantially less than the current standard. I therefore welcome\r\nthe gradual extension of the Trade Board system, provided it follows the\r\ngeneral principle recommended in the Cave Report--that the community\r\nshould use its full powers of compulsion only in regard to the minimum,\r\nand that so far as all other classes of wages are concerned, the State\r\nshould encourage collective bargaining. With this proviso, compulsory\r\nenforcement of a minimum could also be extended to the workpeople\r\ncovered by Whitley Councils.\r\n\r\nAs regards all wages above the minimum the Cave Committee recommended\r\nthat, provided they are reached by agreement on the Board, and provided\r\nthat a sufficiently large proportion of the Board concur, the wage so\r\ndetermined shall be enforced by civil process, whereas in the cases of\r\nthe minimum, the rates would be determined if necessary by arbitration\r\nof the State-appointed members of the Board, and non-payment would be a\r\npenal offence. The Trade Boards now cover three million workers. Two\r\nmillion are in occupations for which Trade Boards are under\r\nconsideration, and there are a further two million under Industrial\r\nCouncils or Whitley Councils. If State powers are to be employed in\r\ntrades employing seven millions of the eighteen million wage-earners of\r\nthe country, the scope of those powers needs to be very carefully\r\ndefined.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CASE FOR PROFIT-SHARING\r\n\r\nMany Liberals are, however, asking whether this is sufficient and\r\nwhether it is not possible for the State to intervene to alter the\r\ndistribution of the product of industry in favour of the wage-earner. In\r\nparticular, they are wondering whether it is possible to secure the\r\nuniversal application of some system of profit-sharing. The underlying\r\nprinciple of profit-sharing is indeed one which we must look to if the\r\nwhole-hearted assistance of labour is to be enlisted behind the\r\nproductive effort of the country. But the profit we have to consider is\r\nthe profit over which the worker has some influence. There is no merit\r\nin inviting him to share in purely commercial profits or losses which\r\nmay be due to some one else's speculation or business foresight. It is\r\nfutile to imagine you can reverse the functions of labour and capital,\r\nand say that capital should have a fixed wage, and that the employee\r\nshould bear all the risks of the industry.\r\n\r\nAgain, in some cases it is suitable that profits should be considered in\r\nregard to a whole industry, but in others only in regard to a particular\r\nfirm or section; and finally the rate of profit suitable to various\r\ntrades varies between very wide limits. In short, there can be no\r\nuniversal rule in this matter which can be enforced by Act of\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we must all desire to proceed along the lines of\r\nassociating the pecuniary interests of the worker in the success of the\r\nenterprise, and if any one can suggest a way in which direct assistance\r\nto that end can be given by political action, as distinct from\r\nindustrial, he will be doing a great service. I may add that there is an\r\nargument in favour of profit-sharing which is of the utmost importance\r\nand which was recently expressed by a prominent industrialist: who\r\ndeclared to me that at long last and after much opposition he has come\r\nround to believe in profit-sharing, _because it enables him to show his\r\nmen the balance sheet_. The solution adopted last year in the mining\r\nindustry contains the sort of elements we wish to see adopted in\r\nprinciple. The men are given, through their officials, the results of\r\nthe industry. They see that they cannot get more than the industry can\r\npay, and though the present economic conditions are putting the men in a\r\ndesperate state to-day, the miners, who were often regarded before the\r\nwar as the most pugnacious in the country, are not burning their\r\nemployers' houses, but are studying how the economic conditions of the\r\nindustry can be improved for the benefit of themselves and their\r\nemployers.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDUSTRIAL PUBLICITY\r\n\r\nThis brings me to the question of publicity, which is at the root of the\r\nwhole problem. We desire the principle of private enterprise to remain.\r\nThe one thing that can destroy it is secrecy. We argue that the\r\nself-interest of the investor makes capital flow into those channels\r\nwhere economic conditions need it most. But how can the investor know\r\nwhere it should go when the true financial condition of great industrial\r\ncompanies is a matter of guesswork? Again, we rely upon our bankers to\r\ncheck excessive industrial fluctuations. How can they do this if they do\r\nnot know the facts of production? The public should know what great\r\ncombines are doing, but they do not know; and how can we expect the man\r\nin the street to be satisfied when his mind is filled with suspicions\r\nthat can be neither confirmed nor removed?\r\n\r\nIt is of the utmost importance to seek for greater publicity on two\r\nmain lines. The illustration of the mines suggests one--production and\r\nwage data. There are only three industries in this country--coal, steel,\r\nand ships--in which production statistics exist. I suggest that in many\r\nof our great staple industries a few simple data with regard to\r\nproduction should be published promptly, say every three months. The\r\ndata I have in mind are the wages bill, the cost of materials, and the\r\nvalue of the product. It is desirable that this should be done, and I\r\nbelieve it can be done, for almost every great industry in the country.\r\nThese three facts alone will bring the whole wages discussion down to\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThen on finance, I suggest that one of the first things a Liberal\r\nGovernment should do should be to appoint a commission to overhaul the\r\nwhole of our Company Law. This is not the occasion to enter in detail\r\ninto a highly technical problem. But I would call attention to the\r\nfollowing points: There is no compulsion on any joint-stock company to\r\npublish a balance sheet. It is almost the universal practice to do so;\r\nbut as it is not an obligation, the Company Law lays down no rules as to\r\nwhat published balance sheets must contain. Again, the difference\r\nbetween private and public companies must be considered; a private\r\ncompany which employs a great mass of capital and large numbers of\r\nwork-people--a concern which may cover a whole town or district--should\r\nin the public interest be subject to the same rules as a public company.\r\nThirdly, in view of the amalgamation of industry, the linking up of\r\ncompany with company, there must be reconsideration as regards publicity\r\nin the case of subsidiary companies. Finally, I think we have been wrong\r\nin assuming that a law applicable to a company with a modest little\r\ncapital is suitable to regulate the publicity of a great combine\r\ncontrolling tens of millions of capital. Some attempt should therefore\r\nbe made to differentiate between what must be told by the big and by the\r\nlittle concerns respectively. I am well aware of the myriad difficulties\r\nthat this demand for publicity will encounter. But difficulties exist to\r\nbe overcome. And they must be overcome, for of this I feel certain: that\r\nif the system of private enterprise dies, it will be because the canker\r\nof secrecy has eaten into its vitals.\r\n\r\n\r\nA NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL COUNCIL\r\n\r\nI have left very little time for dealing specifically with the question\r\nof industrial relations, though much that I have said has a bearing upon\r\nit. There has been great disappointment with the results of the Whitley\r\nCouncil movement. Many thought they were going to bring in a new era.\r\nBut they have not lived up to these hopes, firstly, because they came\r\ninto being at a time of unexampled economic difficulty, and, secondly,\r\nbecause they were introduced into industries where there was no\r\ntradition of co-operative action--being established mainly in industries\r\nlying between the entirely unorganised and the highly organised trades.\r\nBut we must persist in encouraging Whitley Councils, and still more in\r\nthe associated objective of encouraging works committees. The basis of\r\nindustrial peace is in the individual works. Co-operation cannot be\r\ncreated by Act of Parliament, but depends upon the development of\r\nopinion among employers and workmen. Starting from Works Councils up\r\nthrough the Whitley Council, Trade Boards, or National Trade Union\r\nmachinery for the negotiation of wages, we arrive at the National\r\nIndustrial Council, which is the point at which the Government can most\r\ndirectly assist the movement towards more cordial relations. The plan of\r\nthis Council is ready. It was proposed and developed in 1919, and I\r\npersonally do not want to change that plan very much.\r\n\r\nBut I think it is of the utmost importance that we should embody in our\r\nLiberal programme the institution of a National Industrial Council or\r\nParliament representing the trade organisations on both sides. Whether\r\nit should represent the consumers, I, personally, am doubtful. It should\r\nbe consulted before economic and particularly industrial legislation is\r\nintroduced into Parliament. It should be the forum on which we should\r\nget a much better informed discussion of industrial problems than is\r\npossible in Parliament or through any other agency in the country. The\r\nNational Council also needs to have specific work to do. I would be\r\nprepared to see transferred to it many of the functions of the Ministry\r\nof Labour, or rather that it should be made obligatory for the Minister\r\nof Labour to consult this Council on such questions as whether it should\r\nhold a compulsory inquiry into an industrial dispute. I would also\r\nthrow upon it the duty of advising Parliament exactly how my proposals\r\nas to publicity are to be carried out, and would give it responsibility\r\nfor the Ministry of Labour index figures of the cost of living upon\r\nwhich so many industrial agreements depend. I believe if we could set\r\nout a series of specific functions to give the plan vitality, in\r\naddition to the more nebulous duty of advising the Government on\r\nindustrial questions, we should have created an important device for\r\npromoting the mutual confidence of which I have spoken.\r\n\r\nThe suggestions I have made are perhaps not very new, but they seem to\r\nme to be in the natural line of evolution of Liberal traditions. Above\r\nall, if they are accepted they should be pursued unflinchingly and\r\npersevered with, not as a concession to this or that section which may\r\nhappen to be strong at the moment, but as a corporate policy, which aims\r\nat combining the interests of us all in securing increased national\r\nwealth with justice to the component classes of the commonwealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REGULATION OF WAGES\r\n\r\nBY PROFESSOR L.T. HOBHOUSE\r\n\r\nProfessor of Sociology, London University.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Hobhouse said:--The wages, hours, and general conditions of\r\nindustrial workers are of interest to the community from two points of\r\nview. So far as the less skilled and lower paid workers are concerned,\r\nit is to the interest and it is the duty of the community to protect\r\nthem from oppression, and to secure that every one of its members, who\r\nis willing and able to contribute honest and industrious work to the\r\nservice of others, should be able in return to gain the means of a\r\ndecent and civilised life. In this relation the establishment of a\r\nminimum wage is analogous to the restriction of hours or the provision\r\nfor safety and health secured by Factory Legislation, and carries\r\nforward the provision for a minimum standard of life. The problem is to\r\ndetermine upon the minimum and adjust its enforcement to the conditions\r\nof trade in such wise as to avoid industrial dislocation and consequent\r\nunemployment.\r\n\r\nWith regard to workers of higher skill, who command wages or salaries on\r\na more generous scale, the interest of the community is of a different\r\nkind. Such workers hardly stand in need of any special protection. They\r\nare well able to take care of themselves, and sometimes through\r\ncombination are, in fact, the stronger party in the industrial bargain.\r\nIn this region the interest of the community lies in maintaining\r\nindustrial peace and securing the maximum of goodwill and co-operation.\r\nThe intervention of the community in industrial disputes, however, has\r\nnever been very popular with either party in the State. Both sides to a\r\ndispute are inclined to trust to their own strength, and are only ready\r\nto submit to an impartial judgment when convinced that they are\r\nmomentarily the weaker. Nor is it easy when we once get above the\r\nminimum to lay down any general principles which a court of arbitration\r\ncould apply in grading wages.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons the movement for compulsory arbitration has never in\r\nthis country advanced very far. We have an Industrial Court which can\r\ninvestigate a dispute, find a solution which commends itself as\r\nreasonable, and publish its finding, but without any power of\r\nenforcement. The movement has for the present stuck there, and is likely\r\nto take a long time to get further. Yet every one recognises the damage\r\ninflicted by industrial disputes, and would admit in the abstract the\r\ndesirability of a more rational method of settlement than that of\r\npitting combination against combination. Such a method may, I would\r\nsuggest, grow naturally out of the system which has been devised for the\r\nprotection of unskilled and unorganised workers, of which a brief\r\naccount may now be given.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ESTABLISHMENT OF TRADE BOARDS\r\n\r\nUtilising experience gained in Australia, Parliament in 1909 passed an\r\nAct empowering the Board of Trade (now the Ministry of Labour) to\r\nestablish a Trade Board in any case where the rate of wages prevailing\r\nin any branch was \"exceptionally low as compared with that in other\r\nemployments.\" The Board consisted of a number of persons selected by the\r\nMinister as representatives of employers, an equal number as\r\nrepresentatives of the workers, with a chairman and generally two\r\ncolleagues not associated with the trade, and known as the Appointed\r\nMembers. These three members hold a kind of casting vote, and can in\r\ngeneral secure a decision if the sides disagree.\r\n\r\nNo instruction was given in the statute as to the principles on which\r\nthe Board should determine wages, but the Board has necessarily in mind\r\non the one side the requirements of the worker, and on the other the\r\neconomic position of the trade. The workers' representatives naturally\r\nemphasise the one aspect and the employers the other, but the appointed\r\nmembers and the Board as a whole must take account of both. They must\r\nconsider what the trade in general can afford to pay and yet continue to\r\nprosper and to give full employment to the workers. They must also\r\nconsider the rate at which the worker can pay his way and live a decent,\r\ncivilised life. Mere subsistence is not enough. It is a cardinal point\r\nof economic justice that a well-organised society will enable a man to\r\nearn the means of living as a healthy, developed, civilised being by\r\nhonest and useful service to the community. I would venture to add that\r\nin a perfectly organised society he would not be able--charitable\r\nprovision apart--to make a living by any other method. There is nothing\r\nin these principles to close the avenues to personal initiative or to\r\ndeny a career to ability and enterprise. On the contrary, it is a point\r\nof justice that such qualities should have their scope, but not to the\r\ninjury of others. For this, I suggest with confidence to a Liberal\r\naudience, is the condition by which all liberty must be defined.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: I may perhaps be allowed to refer to my _Elements of Social\r\nJustice_, Allen & Unwin, 1921, for the fuller elaboration of these\r\nprinciples.]\r\n\r\nIf we grant that it is the duty of the Boards to aim at a decent\r\nminimum--one which in Mr. Seebohm Rowntree's phrase would secure the\r\n\"human needs\" of labour--we have still some very difficult points of\r\nprinciple and of detail to settle. First and foremost, do we mean the\r\nneeds of the individual worker or of a family, and if of the latter, how\r\nlarge a family? It has been generally thought that a man's wages should\r\nsuffice for a family on the ground that there ought to be no economic\r\ncompulsion--though there should be full legal and social liberty--for\r\nthe mother to eke out deficiencies in the father's payment by going out\r\nto work. It has also been thought that a woman is not ordinarily under a\r\nsimilar obligation to maintain a family, so that her \"human needs\" would\r\nbe met by a wage sufficient to maintain herself as an independent\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\nThese views have been attacked as involving a differentiation unfair in\r\nthe first instance to women, but in the second instance to men, because\r\nopening a way to undercutting. The remedy proposed is public provision\r\nfor children under the industrial age, and for the mother in return for\r\nher work in looking after them. With this subvention, it is conceived,\r\nthe rates for men or women might be equalised on the basis of a\r\nsufficiency for the individual alone. This would certainly simplify the\r\nwages question, but at the cost of a serious financial question. I do\r\nnot, myself, think that \"human needs\" can be fully met without the\r\ncommon provision of certain essentials for children. One such\r\nessential--education, has been long recognised as too costly to be put\r\nupon the wages of the worker. We may find that we shall have to add to\r\nthe list if we are to secure to growing children all that the community\r\nwould desire for them. On the other hand, the main responsibility for\r\ndirecting its own life should be left to each family, and this carries\r\nthe consequence, that the adult-man's wage should be based not on\r\npersonal but on family requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOMEN'S WAGES\r\n\r\nBut the supposed injustice to woman is illusory. Trade Boards will not\r\nknowingly fix women's rates at a point at which they can undercut men.\r\nNor if women are properly represented on them will they fix their rates\r\nat a point at which women will be discarded in favour of male workers.\r\nIn industries where both sexes are employed, if the women workers are of\r\nequal value with the men in the eyes of the employer, they will receive\r\nequal pay; if of less value, then, but only then, proportionately less\r\npay. It is because women have received not proportionately but quite\r\ndisproportionately less pay that they have been undercutting men, and\r\nthe Trade Boards are--very gradually, I admit--correcting this error.\r\nFor well-known historical reasons women have been at an economic\r\ndisadvantage, and their work has secured less than its worth as compared\r\nwith the work of men. The tendency of any impartial adjustment of wages\r\nis to correct this disadvantage, because any such system will attempt to\r\nsecure equality of opportunity for employment for all the classes with\r\nwhich it is dealing. But it is admitted that there is a \"lag\" in women's\r\nwages which has been but partially made good.\r\n\r\nIf the standard wage must provide for a family, what must be the size of\r\nthe family? Discussion on the subject generally assumes a \"statistical\"\r\nfamily of man and wife and three children under age. This is criticised\r\non the ground that it does not meet the human needs of larger families\r\nand is in excess for smaller ones. The reply to this is that a general\r\nrate can only meet general needs. Calculation easily shows that the\r\nminimum suited for three children is by no means extravagant if there\r\nshould be but two children or only one, while it gives the bachelor or\r\nnewly married couple some small chance of getting a little beforehand\r\nwith the world. On the other hand, it is impossible to cater on general\r\nprinciples for the larger needs of individuals. The standard wage gives\r\nan approximation to what is needed for the ordinary family, and the\r\nbalance must be made good by other provision, whether public or private\r\nI will not here discuss. I conclude that for adult men the minimum is\r\nreasonably fixed at a figure which would meet the \"human needs\" of a\r\nfamily of five, and that for women it should be determined by the value\r\nof their services relatively to that of men.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: I am assuming that this value is sufficient to cover the\r\nneeds of the independent woman worker. If not, these needs must also be\r\ntaken into account. As a fact both considerations are present to the\r\nminds of the Trade Boards. A Board would not willingly fix a wage which\r\nwould either (_a_) diminish the opportunity of women to obtain\r\nemployment, or (_b_) enable them to undercut men, or (_c_) fail to\r\nprovide for them if living alone.]\r\n\r\nHow far have Trade Boards actually succeeded in fixing such a minimum?\r\nMr. Seebohm Rowntree has put forward two sets of figures based on\r\npre-war prices, and, of course, requiring adjustment for the changes\r\nthat have subsequently taken place. One of these figures was designed\r\nfor a subsistence wage, the other for a \"human needs\" wage. The latter\r\nwas a figure which Mr. Rowntree himself did not expect to see reached in\r\nthe near future. I have compared these figures with the actual minima\r\nfor unskilled workers fixed by the Boards during 1920 and 1921, and I\r\nfind that the rates fixed are intermediate between the two. The\r\nsubsistence rate is passed, but the higher rate not attained, except for\r\nsome classes of skilled workers. The Boards have in general proceeded\r\nwith moderation, but the more serious forms of underpayment have been\r\nsuppressed so far as inspection has been adequately enforced. The ratio\r\nof the female to the male minimum averages 57.2 per cent., which may\r\nseem unduly low, but it must be remembered that in the case of women's\r\nwages a much greater leeway had to be made good, and there can be little\r\ndoubt that the increases secured for female workers considerably\r\nexceeded those obtained for men.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTION OF A SINGLE MINIMUM\r\n\r\nCriticism of Trade Boards has fastened on their power to determine\r\nhigher rates of wages for skilled workers, one of the additional powers\r\nthat they secured under the Act of 1918. There are many who agree that a\r\nbare minimum should be fixed by a statutory authority with legal powers,\r\nbut think that this should be the beginning and end of law's\r\ninterference. As to this, it must be said, first, that the wide margin\r\nbetween a subsistence wage and a human needs wage, brought out by Mr.\r\nRowntree's calculations, shows that there can be no question at present\r\nof a single minimum. To give the \"human needs\" figure legislative\r\nsanction would at present be Utopian. Very few Trade Boards ventured so\r\nfar even when trade was booming. The Boards move in the region between\r\nbare subsistence and \"human needs,\" as trade conditions allow, and can\r\nsecure a better figure for some classes of their clients when they\r\ncannot secure it for all. They therefore need all the elasticity which\r\nthe present law gives them.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is contended with some force by the Cave Committee\r\nthat it is improper for appointed members to decide questions of\r\nrelatively high wages for skilled men or for the law to enforce such\r\nwages by criminal proceedings, and the Committee accordingly propose to\r\ndifferentiate between higher and lower minima both as regards the method\r\nof determination and of enforcement. I have not time here to discuss the\r\ndetails of their proposal, but I wish to say a word on the retention--if\r\nin some altered shape--of the powers given by the Act of 1918. The Trade\r\nBoard system has been remarkable for the development of understanding\r\nand co-operation between representatives of employers and workers.\r\nParticularly in the work of the administrative committees, matters of\r\ndetail which might easily excite controversy and passion are habitually\r\nhandled with coolness and good sense in the common interest of the\r\ntrade. A number of the employers have not merely acquiesced in the\r\nsystem, but have become its convinced supporters, and this attitude\r\nwould be more common if certain irritating causes of friction were\r\nremoved. The employer who desires to treat his workers well and maintain\r\ngood conditions is relieved from the competition of rivals who care\r\nlittle for these things, and what he is chiefly concerned about is\r\nsimplicity of rules and rigid universality of enforcement. It is this\r\nsection of employers who have prevented the crippling of the Boards in a\r\ntime of general reaction. It is blindness to refuse to see in such\r\nco-operation a possible basis of industrial peace, and those were right\r\nwho in 1918 saw in the mechanism of the Boards the possibility, not\r\nmerely of preventing industrial oppression and securing a minimum living\r\nwage, but of advancing to a general regulation of industrial relations.\r\nAt that time it was thought that the whole of industry might be divided\r\nbetween Trade Boards and Whitley Councils, the former for the less, the\r\nlatter for the more organised trades. In the result the Whitley Councils\r\nhave proved to be hampered if not paralysed by the lack of an\r\nindependent element and of compulsory powers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRADE BOARDS HOLDING THE FIELD\r\n\r\nThe Trade Board holds the field as the best machinery for the\r\ndetermination of industrial conditions. It is better than unfettered\r\ncompetition, which leaves the weak at the mercy of the strong. It is\r\nbetter than the contest of armed forces, in which the battle is decided\r\nwith no reference to equity, to permanent economic conditions, or to the\r\ngeneral good, by the main strength of one combination or the other in\r\nthe circumstances of the moment. It is better than a universal\r\nState-determined wages-law which would take no account of fluctuating\r\nindustrial conditions, and better than official determinations which are\r\nexposed to political influences and are apt to ignore the technicalities\r\nwhich only the practical worker or employer understands. It is better\r\nthan arbitration, which acts intermittently and incalculably from\r\noutside, and makes no call on the continuous co-operation of the trade\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nMy hope is that as the true value of the Trade Board comes to be better\r\nunderstood, its powers, far from being jealously curtailed, or confined\r\nto the suppression of the worst form of underpayment, will be extended\r\nto skilled employments, and organised industries, and be used not merely\r\nto fulfil the duty of the community to its humblest members, but to\r\nserve its still wider interest in the development of peaceful industrial\r\nco-operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNEMPLOYMENT\r\n\r\nBY H.D. HENDERSON\r\n\r\nM.A.; Fellow of Clare College, Cambridge; Lecturer in Economics;\r\nSecretary to the Cotton Control Board from 1917-1919.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Henderson said:--From one point of view the existence of an\r\nunemployment problem is an enigma and a paradox. In a world, where even\r\nbefore the war the standard of living that prevailed among the mass of\r\nthe people was only what it was, even in those countries which we termed\r\nwealthy, it seems at first sight an utterly astonishing anomaly that at\r\nfrequent intervals large numbers of competent and industrious\r\nwork-people should find no work to do. The irony of the situation cannot\r\nbe more tersely expressed than in the words, which a man is supposed to\r\nhave uttered as he watched a procession of unemployed men: \"No work to\r\ndo. Set them to rebuild their own houses.\"\r\n\r\nBut, if we reflect just a shade more deeply, nothing should surprise us\r\nless than unemployment. We have more reason for surprise that it is\r\nusually upon so small a scale. The economic system under which we live\r\nin the modern world is very peculiar and only our familiarity with it\r\nkeeps us from perceiving how peculiar it is. In one sense it is highly\r\norganised; in another sense it is not organised at all. There is an\r\nelaborate differentiation of functions--the \"division of labour,\" to\r\ngive it its time-honoured name, under which innumerable men and women\r\nperform each small specialised tasks, which fit into one another with\r\nthe complexity of a jig-saw puzzle, to form an integral whole. Some men\r\ndig coal from the depths of the earth, others move that coal over land\r\nby rail and over the seas in ships, others are working in factories, at\r\nhome and abroad, which consume that coal, or in shipyards which build\r\nthe ships; and it is obvious, not to multiply examples further, that the\r\nnumbers of men engaged on those various tasks must somehow be adjusted,\r\n_in due proportions_ to one another. It is no use, for instance,\r\nbuilding more ships than are required to carry the stuff there is to\r\ncarry.\r\n\r\nAdjustment, co-ordination, must somehow be secured. Well, how is it\r\nsecured? Who is it that ordains that, say, a million men shall work in\r\nthe coal-mines, and 600,000 on the railways, and 200,000 in the\r\nshipyards, and so on? Who apportions the nation's labour power between\r\nthe innumerable different occupations, so as to secure that there are\r\nnot too many and not too few engaged in any one of them relatively to\r\nthe others? Is it the Prime Minister, or the Cabinet, or Parliament, or\r\nthe Civil Service? Is it the Trade Union Congress, or the Federation of\r\nBritish Industries, or does any one suppose that it is some hidden cabal\r\nof big business interests? No, there is no co-ordinator. There is no\r\nhuman brain or organisation responsible for fitting together this vast\r\njig-saw puzzle; and, that being so, I say that what should really excite\r\nour wonder is the fact that that puzzle should somehow get fitted\r\ntogether, usually with so few gaps left unfilled and with so few pieces\r\nleft unplaced.\r\n\r\nIt would, indeed, be a miracle, if it were not for the fact that those\r\nold economic laws, whose impersonal forces of supply and demand, whose\r\nexistence some people nowadays are inclined to dispute, or to regard as\r\nbeing in extremely bad taste, really do work in a manner after all. They\r\nare our co-ordinators, the only ones we have; and they do their work\r\nwith much friction and waste, only by correcting a maladjustment after\r\nit has taken place, by slow and often cruel devices, of which one of the\r\nmost cruel is, precisely, unemployment and all the misery it entails.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAUSES OF TRADE DEPRESSIONS\r\n\r\nI do not propose to deal with such branches of the problem of\r\nunemployment as casual labour or seasonal fluctuations. I confine myself\r\nto what we all, I suppose, feel to be the really big problem, to\r\nunemployment which is not special to particular industries or districts,\r\nbut which is common to them all, to a general depression of almost every\r\nform of business and industrial activity. General trade depressions are\r\nno new phenomenon, though the present depression is, of course, far\r\nworse than any we have experienced in modern times. They used to occur\r\nso regularly that long before the war people had come to speak of\r\ncyclical fluctuations, or to use a phrase which is now common, the trade\r\ncycle. That is a useful phrase, and a useful conception. It is well that\r\nwe should realise, when we speak of those normal pre-war conditions, to\r\nwhich we hope some day to revert, that in a sense trade conditions never\r\nwere normal; that, at any particular moment you care to take, we were\r\neither in full tide of a trade boom, with employment active and prices\r\nrising, and order books congested; or else right on the crest of the\r\nboom, when prices were no longer rising generally, though they had not\r\nyet commenced to fall, when employment was still good, but when new\r\norders were no longer coming in; or else in the early stages of a\r\ndepression, with prices falling, and every one trying to unload stocks\r\nand failing to do so, and works beginning to close down; or else right\r\nin the trough of the depression where we are to-day; that we were at one\r\nor other of the innumerable stages of the trade cycle, without any\r\nprospect of remaining there for very long, but always, as it were, in\r\nmotion, going round and round and round.\r\n\r\nWhat are the root causes which bring every period of active trade to an\r\ninevitable end? There are two which are almost invariably present\r\ntowards the end of every boom. First, the general level of prices and\r\nwages has usually become too high; it is straining against the limits of\r\nthe available supplies of currency and credit, and, unless inflation is\r\nto be permitted, a restriction of credit is inevitable which will bring\r\non a trade depression. In those circumstances, a reduction of the\r\ngeneral level of prices and wages is an essential condition of a trade\r\nrevival. A reduction of prices _and wages_. That point has a\r\nsignificance to which I will return.\r\n\r\nThe second cause is the distorted balance which grows up in every boom\r\nbetween different branches of industrial activity. When trade is good,\r\nwe invariably build ships, produce machinery, erect factories, make\r\nevery variety of what are termed \"constructional goods\" upon a scale\r\nwhich is altogether disproportionate to the scale upon which we are\r\nmaking \"consumable goods\" like food and clothes. And that condition of\r\nthings could not possibly endure for very long. If it were to continue\r\nindefinitely, it would lead in the end to our having, say, half a dozen\r\nships for every ton of wheat or cotton which there was to carry. You\r\nhave there a maladjustment, which must be corrected somehow; and the\r\nlonger the readjustment is postponed, the bigger the readjustment that\r\nwill ultimately be inevitable. Now that means, first on the negative\r\nside, that, when you are confronted with a trade depression, it is\r\nhopeless to try to cure it by looking for some device by which you can\r\ngive a general stimulus to all forms of industry. Devices of that nature\r\nmay be very useful in the later stages of a trade depression, when the\r\nnecessary readjustments both of the price-level and of the relative\r\noutputs of different classes of commodities have already been effected,\r\nand when trade remains depressed only because people have not yet\r\nplucked up the necessary confidence to start things going again. But in\r\nthe early stages of a depression, an indiscriminating stimulus to\r\nindustry in general will serve only to perpetuate the maladjustments\r\nwhich are the root of the trouble. It will only put off the evil day,\r\nand make it worse when it comes. The problem is not one of getting\r\neverybody back to work on their former jobs. It is one of getting them\r\nset to work on the _right_ jobs; and that is a far more difficult\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nOn the positive side, what this really comes to is, that if you wish to\r\nprevent depressions occurring you must prevent booms taking the form\r\nthey do. You must prevent prices rising so much, and so many\r\nconstructional goods being made during the period of active trade; and I\r\nam not going to pretend that that is an easy thing to do. It's all very\r\nwell to say that the bankers, through their control of the credit\r\nsystem, might endeavour to guide industry and keep it from straying out\r\nof the proper channels. But the bankers would have to know much more\r\nthan they do about these matters, and, furthermore, the problem is not\r\nmerely a national one--it is a world-wide problem. It would be of little\r\nuse to prevent an excess of ships being built here, if that only meant\r\nthat still more ships were built, say, in the United States.\r\n\r\nI do not say that even now the banks might not do something which would\r\nhelp; still less do I wish to convey the impression that mankind must\r\nalways remain passive and submissive, impotent to control these forces\r\nwhich so vitally affect his welfare. But I say that for any serious\r\nattempt to master this problem, the necessary detailed knowledge has\r\nstill to be acquired, and the rudiments of organisation have still to be\r\nbuilt up; and the problem is not one at this stage for policies and\r\nprogrammes. What you can do by means of policies and programmes lies, at\r\npresent, in the sphere of international politics. In that sphere,\r\nthough you cannot achieve all, you might achieve much. To reduce the\r\nproblem to its pre-war dimensions would be no small result; and that\r\nrepresents a big enough objective, for the time being, for the\r\nconcentration of our hardest thinking and united efforts. But into that\r\nsphere I am not going to enter. I pass to the problem of unemployment\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCALE OF RELIEF\r\n\r\nThe fundamental difficulty of the problem of relieving unemployment is a\r\nvery old one. It turns upon what used to be called, ninety years ago,\r\n\"the principle of less eligibility,\" the principle that the position of\r\nthe man who is unemployed and receiving support from the community\r\nshould be made upon the whole less eligible, less attractive than that\r\nof the man who is working and living upon the wages that he earns. That\r\nis a principle which has been exposed to much criticism and denunciation\r\nin these modern days. We are told that it is the false and antiquated\r\ndoctrine of a hard-hearted and coarse-minded age, which thought that\r\nunemployment was usually a man's own fault, which saw a malingerer in\r\nevery recipient of relief, which was obsessed by the bad psychology of\r\npains and penalties and looked instinctively for a deterrent as the cure\r\nfor every complex evil.\r\n\r\nBut, however that may be, this principle of less eligibility is one\r\nwhich you cannot ignore. It is not merely or mainly a matter of the\r\neffect on the character of the workmen who receive relief. The danger\r\nthat adequate relief will demoralise the recipient has, I agree, been\r\ngrossly exaggerated in the past. Prolonged unemployment is always in\r\nitself demoralising. But, given that a man is unemployed, it will not\r\ndemoralise him more that he should receive adequate relief rather than\r\ninadequate relief or no relief at all. On the contrary, on balance, it\r\nwill, I believe, demoralise him less. For nothing so unfits a man for\r\nwork as that he should go half-starved, or lack the means to maintain\r\nthe elementary decencies of life.\r\n\r\nBut there are other considerations which you have to take into account.\r\nIf you get a situation such that the man who loses his job becomes\r\nthereby much better-off than the man who remains at work, I do not say\r\nthat the former man will necessarily be demoralised, but I do say that\r\nthe latter man will become disgruntled. I do not want to put that\r\nconsideration too high. At the present time there are many such\r\nanomalies; in a great many occupations, the wages that the men at work\r\nare receiving amount to much less than the money they would obtain if\r\nthey lost their jobs and were labelled unemployed. But they have stuck\r\nto their jobs, they are carrying on, with a patience and good humour\r\nthat are beyond all praise. Yes, but that state of affairs is so\r\nanomalous, so contrary to our elementary sense of fairness that, as a\r\npermanent proposition it would prove intolerable. We cannot go on for\r\never with a system under which in many trades men receive much more when\r\nthey are unemployed than when they are at work. On the other hand, the\r\nattempt to avoid such anomalies leads us, so long as we have a uniform\r\nscale of relief, against an alternative which is equally intolerable.\r\nWages vary greatly from trade to trade; and, if the scale of relief is\r\nnot to exceed the wages paid in _any_ occupation it must be very low\r\nindeed. That is the root dilemma of the problem of unemployment\r\nrelief--how if your scale of relief is not to be too high for equity and\r\nprudence it is not to be too low for humanity and decency. We have not,\r\nas some people imagine, done anything in recent years to escape from it,\r\nwe have merely exchanged one horn of the dilemma for the other.\r\n\r\nIn any satisfactory system the scale of relief must vary from occupation\r\nto occupation, in accordance with the normal standard of wages ruling in\r\neach case. But it is very difficult, in fact I think it would always be\r\nimpracticable to do that under any system of relief, administered by the\r\nState, either the Central Government or the local authorities. It must\r\nbe done on an industrial basis; each industry settling its own scale,\r\nfinding its own money, and managing its own scheme. That is an idea\r\nwhich has received much ventilation in the last few years. But the\r\nreally telling arguments in favour of it do not seem to me to have\r\nreceived sufficient stress.\r\n\r\nForemost among them I place the consideration I have just indicated:\r\nthat in this way, and in this way alone, it becomes possible for\r\nwork-people who receive high wages when they are at work, and where\r\nhabits of expenditure and standards of family living are built up on\r\nthat basis, to receive when unemployed, adequate relief without that\r\nleading to anomalies which in the long run would prove intolerable. But\r\nthere are many other arguments.\r\n\r\n\r\nA MODEL SCHEME FROM LANCASHIRE\r\n\r\nAbout five years ago I had the opportunity of witnessing at very close\r\nquarters the working of an unemployment scheme on an industrial basis.\r\nThe great Lancashire cotton industry was faced during the war with a\r\nvery serious unemployment problem, owing to the difficulty of\r\ntransporting sufficient cotton from America. It met that situation with\r\na scheme of unemployment relief, devised and administered by one of\r\nthose war Control Boards, which in this case was essentially a\r\nrepresentative joint committee of employers and employed. The money was\r\nraised, every penny of it, from the employers in the industry itself;\r\nthe Cotton Control Board laid down certain rules and regulations as to\r\nthe scale of benefits, and the conditions entitling a worker to receive\r\nit; and the task of applying those rules and paying the money out was\r\nentrusted to the trade unions.\r\n\r\nWell, I was in a good position to watch that experiment. I do not think\r\nI am a particularly credulous person, or one prone to indulge in easy\r\nenthusiasms, and I certainly don't believe in painting a fairy picture\r\nin glowing colours by way of being encouraging. But I say deliberately\r\nthat there has never been an unemployment scheme in this country or in\r\nany other country which has worked with so little abuse, with so few\r\nanomalies, with so little demoralisation to any one, and at the same\r\ntime which has met so adequately the needs of a formidable situation, or\r\ngiven such general satisfaction all round as that Cotton Control Board\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\nI cannot describe as fully as I should like to do the various features\r\nwhich made that scheme attractive, and made it a success. I will take\r\njust one by way of illustration. It is technically possible in the\r\ncotton trade to work the mills with relays of workers, so that if a mill\r\nhas 100 work-people, and can only employ 80 work-people each week, the\r\nwhole 100 can work each for four weeks out of the five, and \"play off,\"\r\nas it is called, in regular sequence for the fifth week. And that was\r\nwhat was done for a long time. It was called the \"rota\" system; and the\r\n\"rota\" week of \"playing off\" became a very popular institution. Under\r\nthat system, benefits which would have been far from princely as the\r\nsole source of income week after week--they never amounted to more than\r\n30/- for a man and 18/- for a woman--assumed a much more liberal aspect.\r\nFor they came only as the occasional variants of full wages; and they\r\nwere accompanied not by the depressing circumstances of long-continued\r\nunemployment, but by what is psychologically an entirely different and\r\npositively exhilarating thing, a full week's holiday. That meant that\r\nthe available resources--and one of the difficulties of any scheme of\r\nunemployment relief is that the resources available are always\r\nlimited--did much more to prevent misery and distress, and went much\r\nfurther towards fulfilling all the objects of an unemployment scheme\r\nthan would have been possible otherwise.\r\n\r\nThat system was possible in the cotton trade; in other trades it might\r\nbe impossible for technical reasons, or, where possible, it might in\r\ncertain circumstances be highly undesirable. The point I wish to stress\r\nis that under an industrial scheme you have an immense flexibility, you\r\ncan adapt all the details to the special conditions of the particular\r\nindustry, and by that means you can secure results immeasurably superior\r\nto anything that is possible under a universal State system. Moreover,\r\nif certain features of the scheme should prove in practice\r\nunsatisfactory, they can be altered with comparatively little\r\ndifficulty. You don't need to be so desperately afraid of the\r\npossibility of making a mistake as you must when it is a case of a great\r\nnational scheme, which can only be altered by Act of Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MORAL OBLIGATION OF INDUSTRIES\r\n\r\nI do not underrate the difficulty of applying this principle of\r\nindustrial relief over the whole field of industry. There is the great\r\ndifficulty of defining an industry, or drawing the lines of demarcation\r\nbetween one trade and another. I have not time to elaborate those\r\ndifficulties, but I consider that they constitute an insuperable\r\nobstacle to anything in the nature of an Act of Parliament, which would\r\nimpose forcibly upon each industry the obligation to work out an\r\nunemployment scheme. The initiative must come from within the industry;\r\nthe organisations of employers and employed must get together and work\r\nout their own scheme, on their own responsibility and with a free hand.\r\nAnd, if it happens in this way--one industry taking the lead and others\r\nfollowing--these difficulties of demarcation become comparatively\r\nunimportant. You can let an industry define itself more or less as it\r\nlikes, and it does not matter much if its distinctions are somewhat\r\narbitrary. It is not a fatal drawback if some firms and work-people are\r\nleft outside who would like to be brought in. And if there are two\r\nindustries which overlap one another, each of which is contemplating a\r\nscheme of the kind, it is a comparatively simple matter for the\r\nresponsible bodies in the two industries to agree with one another as to\r\nthe lines of demarcation between them, as was actually done during the\r\nwar by the Cotton Control Board and the Wool Control Board, with\r\npractically no difficulty whatever. But for such agreements to work\r\nsmoothly it is essential that the industries concerned should be anxious\r\nto make their schemes a success; and that is another reason why you\r\ncannot impose this policy by _force majeure_ upon a reluctant trade. It\r\nis in the field of industry that the real move must be made.\r\n\r\nBut I think that Parliament and the Government might come in to the\r\npicture. In the first place, the ordinary national system of\r\nunemployment relief, which must in any case continue, might be so framed\r\nas to encourage rather than to discourage the institution of industrial\r\nschemes. Under the Insurance Act of 1920 \"contracting out\" was provided\r\nfor, but it was penalised, while at the present moment it is prohibited\r\naltogether. I say that it should rather be encouraged, that everything\r\nshould be done, in fact, to suggest that not a legal but a moral\r\nobligation lies upon each industry to do its best to work out a\r\nsatisfactory unemployment scheme. And, when an industry has done that, I\r\nthink the State should come in again. I think that the representative\r\njoint committee, formed to administer such a scheme, might well be\r\nendowed by statute with a formal status, and certain clearly-defined\r\npowers--such as the Cotton Control Board possessed during the war--of\r\nenforcing its decisions.\r\n\r\nBut--and, of course, there is a \"but\"--we cannot expect very much from\r\nthis in the near future. We must wait for better trade conditions before\r\nwe begin; and, as I have already indicated, the prospects of really good\r\ntrade in the next few years are none too well assured. For a long time\r\nto come, it is clear, we must rely upon the ordinary State machinery for\r\nthe provision of unemployment relief; and, of course, the machinery of\r\nthe State will always be required to cover a large part of the ground.\r\nThe liability which an industry assumes must necessarily be strictly\r\nlimited in point of time; and there are many occupations in which it\r\nwill probably always prove impracticable for the occupation to assume\r\neven a temporary liability. For the meantime, at any rate, we must rely\r\nmainly upon the State machinery. Is it possible to improve upon the\r\npresent working of this machinery? I think it is. By the State machinery\r\nI mean not merely the Central Government, but the local authorities and\r\nthe local Boards of Guardians.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESENT MACHINERY OF RELIEF\r\n\r\nAt present what is the situation? Most unemployed work-people are\r\nentitled to receive certain payments from the Employment Exchanges under\r\na so-called Insurance scheme, which is administered on a national basis;\r\nsome weeks they are entitled to receive those payments, other weeks they\r\nare not; but in any case those payments afford relief which is\r\nadmittedly inadequate, and they are supplemented--and very materially\r\nsupplemented--by sums varying from one locality to another, but within\r\neach locality on a uniform scale, which are paid by the Boards of\r\nGuardians in the form of outdoor relief. Now that situation is highly\r\nunsatisfactory. The system of outdoor relief and the machinery of the\r\nGuardians are not adapted for work of this kind. They are designed to\r\nmeet the problem of individual cases of distress, not necessarily\r\narising from unemployment, but in any event individual cases to be dealt\r\nwith, each on its own merits, after detailed inquiry into the special\r\ncircumstances of the case. That is the function which the Guardians are\r\nfitted to perform, and it is a most important function, which will still\r\nhave to be discharged by the Guardians, or by similar local bodies,\r\nwhatever the national system of unemployment relief may be. But for\r\ndealing with unemployment wholesale, for paying relief in accordance\r\nwith a fixed scale and without regard to individual circumstances--for\r\nthat work the Guardians are a most inappropriate body. They possess no\r\nqualification for it which the Central Government does not possess,\r\nwhile they have some special and serious disqualifications.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it is preposterous that you should have two agencies, each\r\nrelieving the same people in the same wholesale way, the Employment\r\nExchanges with their scale, asking whether a man is unemployed, and how\r\nmany children he has to support, and paying him so much, and the\r\nGuardians with their scale, asking only the same questions and paying\r\nhim so much more. It would obviously be simpler, more economical, and\r\nmore satisfactory in every way, if one or other of those agencies paid\r\nthe man the whole sum. And I have no hesitation in saying that that\r\nagency should be the Central Government. Perhaps the strongest argument\r\nin favour of that course is that, when relief is given locally, the\r\nmoney must be raised by one of the worst taxes in the whole of our\r\nfiscal system, local rates, which are tantamount to a tax, in many\r\ndistricts exceeding 100 per cent., upon erection of houses and buildings\r\ngenerally. It is foolish to imagine that any useful end is served by\r\nkeeping down taxes at the expense of rates.\r\n\r\nSerious as is the problem of national finance, the fiscal resources of\r\nthe Central Government are still far more elastic and less objectionable\r\nthan those which the local authorities possess. I suggest, accordingly,\r\nas a policy for the immediate future, the raising of the scale of\r\nnational relief to a more adequate level, coupled with the abolition of\r\nwhat I have termed wholesale outdoor relief in the localities. What it\r\nis right to pay on a uniform scale should be paid entirely by the\r\nCentral Government, and local outdoor relief should be restricted to its\r\nproper function of the alleviation of cases of exceptional distress\r\nafter special inquiries into the individual circumstances of each case.\r\n\r\nOne final word to prevent misconception. I have said that our present\r\nsystem of relief is unsatisfactory, and I have indicated certain\r\nrespects in which I think it could be improved. But I am far from\r\ncomplaining that relief is being granted throughout the country as a\r\nwhole upon too generous a scale. Anomalies there are which, if they\r\ncontinued indefinitely, would prove intolerable. But we have been\r\npassing through an unparalleled emergency. Unemployment in the last two\r\nyears has been far more widespread and intense than it has ever been\r\nbefore in modern times, and never was it less true that the men out of\r\nwork have mainly themselves to blame. But it has meant far less\r\ndistress, far less destruction of human vitality, and I will add far\r\nless demoralisation of human character than many of the bad years we had\r\nbefore the war. That is due to the system of doles, the national and\r\nlocal doles; and in the circumstances I prefer that system with all its\r\nanomalies to the alternative of a substantially lower scale of relief.\r\nWe are still in the midst of that emergency; and if we are faced, as I\r\nthink for this decade we must expect to be faced, with that dilemma\r\nwhich I indicated earlier, I should prefer, and I hope that every\r\nLiberal will prefer, to err by putting the scale of relief somewhat too\r\nhigh for prudence and equity rather than obviously too low for humanity\r\nand decency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEM OF THE MINES\r\n\r\nBY ARNOLD D. MCNAIR\r\n\r\nM.A., LL.M., C.B.E.; Fellow of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge;\r\nSecretary of Coal Conservation Committee, 1916-1918; Secretary of\r\nAdvisory Board of Coal Controller, 1917-1919; Secretary of Coal Industry\r\nCommission, 1919 (Sankey Commission).\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. McNair said:--Need I labour the point that there _is_ a problem of\r\nthe Mines? Can any one, looking back on the last ten years, when time\r\nafter time a crisis in the mining industry has threatened the internal\r\npeace and equilibrium of the State, deny that there is something\r\nseriously wrong with the present constitution of what our chairman has\r\ndescribed as this great pivotal industry? What is it that is wrong? If I\r\nmay take a historical parallel, will you please contrast the political\r\nsituation and aspirations of the working-class population at the close\r\nof the Napoleonic wars with their industrial situation and aspirations\r\nnow. Politically they were a hundred years ago unenfranchised; more or\r\nless constant political ferment prevailed until the Reform Bill, and\r\nlater, extensions of the franchise applied the Liberal solution of\r\nputting it within the power of the people, if they wished it, to take an\r\neffective share in the control of political affairs.\r\n\r\nIndustrially, their situation to-day is not unlike their political\r\nsituation a hundred years ago. Such influence as they have got is\r\nexerted almost entirely outside the constitution of industry, and very\r\noften in opposition to it. Their trade unions, workers' committees,\r\ncouncils of action, triple alliances, and so forth, are not part of the\r\nregular industrial machine, and too often are found athwart its path.\r\nThey are members of an industry with substantially no constitutional\r\ncontrol over it, just as a hundred years ago they were members of a\r\nState whose destinies they had no constitutional power to direct.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean that a hundred years ago every working man wanted the\r\npolitical vote, nor that now he wants to sit on a committee and control\r\nhis industry. It meant that a substantial number of the more enlightened\r\nand ambitious did--a large enough number to be a source of permanent\r\ndiscontent until they got it. The same is true to-day in the case of\r\nmany industries. Many men in all classes of society are content to do\r\ntheir job, take their money, go home and work in their gardens, or\r\ncourse dogs or fly pigeons. They are very good citizens. Many others,\r\nequally good citizens, take a more mental and active interest in their\r\njob, and want to have some share in the direction of it. This class is\r\nincreasing and should not be discouraged. They constitute our problem.\r\nThe Liberal solution of a gradually extended franchise has cured the\r\npolitical ferment. Political controversy is still acute, and long may it\r\nremain so, as it is the sign of a healthy political society. But the\r\nugly, ominous, revolutionary features of a hundred years ago in the\r\nsphere of politics have substantially gone or been transferred to the\r\nindustrial sphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIBERALISATION OF INDUSTRY\r\n\r\nThe same solution must be applied to that sphere. This does not mean\r\ntransferring the machinery of votes and elections to industry. It means\r\nfinding channels in industry whereby every person may exercise his\r\nlegitimate aspiration, if he should feel one, of being more than a mere\r\nroutine worker while still perhaps doing routine work, and of\r\ncontributing in an effective manner his ideas, thoughts, suggestions,\r\nexperience, to the direction and improvement of the industry. We have\r\nsatisfied the desire for self-expression as citizens, and we have now to\r\nfind some means of satisfying a similar desire for self-expression as\r\nworkers in industry. That is all very vague. Does it mean\r\nco-partnership, profit-sharing, co-operative societies, joint\r\ncommittees, national wages boards, guild socialism, nationalisation? It\r\nmay mean any or all of these things--one in one industry, one in\r\nanother, or several different forms in the same industry--whatever\r\nexperiment may prove to be best suited to each industry. But it must\r\nmean opportunity of experiment, and experiment by all concerned. It must\r\nmean greater recognition by employers of their trusteeship on behalf of\r\ntheir work-people as well as their shareholders; greater recognition of\r\nthe public as opposed to the purely proprietary view of industry; and\r\nrecognition that the man who contributes his manual skill and labour\r\nand risks his life and limb is as much a part of the industry as a man\r\nwho contributes skill in finance, management, or salesmanship, or the\r\nman who risks his capital.\r\n\r\nComing to the mines, that is, the coal mining industry (with a few\r\nincidental mines such as stratified ironstone, fireclay, etc., which\r\nneed not complicate our argument), the first step to the solution of the\r\nproblem of the mines, _i.e._ the collieries, the mining industry, is the\r\nsolution of the problem of the minerals. This distinction is not at\r\nfirst sight obvious to all, but it is fundamental. The ownership and\r\nleasing of the coal is one thing, the business or industry of mining it\r\nis quite another. State ownership of the former does not involve State\r\nownership of the latter. That is elementary and fundamental. It lies at\r\nthe root of what is to follow.\r\n\r\nWill you picture to yourself a section of the coal-mining industry in\r\nthe common form of the pictures one sees of an Atlantic liner cut neatly\r\nin two so as to expose to view what is taking place on each deck. On top\r\nyou have the landowner, under the surface of whose land coal, whether\r\nsuspected or not, has been discovered. He may decide to mine the coal\r\nhimself, but more frequently--indeed, usually--he grants to some persons\r\nor company a lease to mine that coal on payment of what is called a\r\nroyalty of so much for every ton extracted. Thereupon he is called the\r\nmineral-owner or royalty-owner, and the persons or company who actually\r\nengage in the business or industry of coal mining and pay him the\r\nroyalties we shall call the colliery-owners. Do not be misled by the\r\nconfusing term \"coal-owners.\" Very frequently the colliery-owners are\r\ncalled the \"coal-owners,\" and their associations \"coal-owners'\r\nassociations.\" That is quite a misnomer. The real _coal_-owner is the\r\nlandowner, the royalty-owner, though it may well happen that the two\r\nfunctions of owning the minerals and mining them may be combined in the\r\nsame person. Below the colliery-owners we find the managerial staff;\r\nbelow them what may be called the non-commissioned officers of the mine,\r\nsuch as firemen or deputies, who have most important duties as to\r\nsafety, and below them the miners as a whole, that is, both the actual\r\ncoal-getters or hewers or colliers and all the other grades of labour\r\nwho are essential to this the primary operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTION OF ROYALTIES\r\n\r\nComing back to the royalty-owner, you will see his functions are not\r\nvery onerous. He signs receipts for his royalties and occasionally\r\nnegotiates the terms of a lease. But as regards the coal-mining\r\nindustry, he \"toils not, neither does he spin.\" I do not say that\r\nreproachfully, for he (and his number has been estimated at 4000) is\r\ndoubtless a good husband, a kind father, a busy man, and a good citizen.\r\nBut as regards this industry he performs no essential function beyond\r\nallowing the colliery-owners to mine his coal.\r\n\r\nWhat is the total amount annually paid in coal royalties? We can arrive\r\nat an approximate estimate in this way: Average output of coal for five\r\nyears before the war, roughly, 270,000,000 tons; average royalty, 51/2d.\r\nper ton, which means, after deducting coal for colliery consumption and\r\nthe mineral rights duty paid to the State by the royalty-owner, roughly\r\n£5,500,000 per annum paid in coal royalties. Regarding this as an\r\nannuity, the capital value is 70 millions sterling if we allow a\r\npurchaser 8 per cent. on his money (12.5 years' purchase), or 551/2\r\nmillions sterling if we allow him 10 per cent. (10 years' purchase). For\r\nall practical purposes the annuity may be regarded as perpetual.\r\n\r\nNow the State must acquire these royalties. That is the only practicable\r\nsolution, and a condition precedent to any modification in the structure\r\nof the coal-mining industry so long as the participants in that industry\r\ncontinue unwilling or unable to agree upon those modifications\r\nthemselves. _Why and how?_ (1) First and foremost because until then the\r\nState is not master in its own house, and cannot make those experiments\r\nin modifying conditions in the industry which I believe to be essential\r\nto bring it into a healthy condition instead of being a standing menace\r\nto the equilibrium of the State--as it was before the war, and during\r\nthe war, and has been since the war; (2) the technical difficulties and\r\nobstacles resulting from the ownership of the minerals being in the\r\nhands of several thousand private landowners and preventing the economic\r\nworking of coal are enormous. You will find abundant evidence of this\r\nsecond statement in the testimony given by Sir Richard Redmayne and the\r\nlate Mr. James Gemmell and others before the Sankey Commission in 1919.\r\n\r\nHow is the State to acquire them? Not piece-meal, but once and for all\r\nin one final settlement, by an Act of Parliament providing adequate\r\ncompensation in the form of State securities. The assessment of the\r\ncompensation is largely a technical problem, and there is nothing\r\ninsuperable about it. It is being done every day for the purpose of\r\ndeath duties, transfer on sale, etc. Supposing, for the sake of\r\nargument, 551/2 millions sterling is the total capital value of the\r\nroyalties, an ingenious method which has been recommended is to set\r\naside that sum not in cash but in bonds and appoint a tribunal to divide\r\nit equitably amongst all the mineral-owners. That is called \"throwing\r\nthe bun to the bears.\" The State then knows its total commitments, is\r\nnot involved in interminable arbitrations, and can get on with what lies\r\nahead at once, leaving the claimants to fight out the compensation\r\namongst themselves. This does not mean that the State will have to find\r\n551/2 millions sterling in cash. It means this, in the words of Sir\r\nRichard Redmayne: \"The State would in effect say to each owner of a\r\nmineral tract: The value of your property to a purchaser is in present\r\nmoney £x, and you are required to lend to the State the amount of this\r\npurchase price at, say, 5 per cent. per annum, in exchange for which you\r\nwill receive bonds bearing interest at that rate in perpetuity, which\r\nbonds you can sell whenever you like.\"\r\n\r\nThe minerals or royalties being acquired by the State, what then? For\r\nthe first time the State would be placed in a strategic position for\r\nthe control and development of this great national asset. Having\r\nacquired the minerals and issued bonds to compensate the former owners,\r\nthe State enters into the receipt of the royalty payments, and these\r\npayments will be kept alive. We must now decide between at least two\r\ncourses: (_a_) Is the State to do nothing more and merely wait for\r\nexisting leases to expire and fall in, and then attach any new\r\nconditions it may consider necessary upon receiving applications for\r\nrenewals? Or (_b_) is the State to be empowered by Parliament to\r\ndetermine the existing leases at any time and so accelerate the time\r\nwhen it can attach new conditions, make certain re-grouping of mines,\r\netc.? My answer is that the latter course (_b_) must be adopted. The\r\nsame Act of Parliament which vests the coal and the royalties in the\r\nState, or another Act passed at the same time, should give the State\r\npower to determine the then existing leases if and when it chooses,\r\nsubject to just compensation for disturbance in the event of the\r\nexisting lessees refusing to take a fresh lease.\r\n\r\nWhy is course (_b_) recommended? (i) Most leases are granted for terms\r\nvarying from thirty to sixty years. They are falling in year by year,\r\nbut we cannot afford to wait until they have all fallen in if we are\r\neffectively to deal with a pressing problem. (ii) The second objection\r\nto merely waiting is that some colliery-owners (not many) might make up\r\ntheir minds not to apply for a renewal of their leases, and might\r\nconsequently be tempted to neglect the necessary development and\r\nmaintenance work, over-concentrating on output, and thus allowing the\r\ncolliery to get into a backward state from which it would cost much time\r\nand money to recover it--a state of affairs which could and would be\r\nprovided against in future leases, but which the framers of existing\r\nleases may not have visualised. I do not suggest that upon the\r\nacquisition by the State of the minerals all the existing leases should\r\nautomatically determine. But the State should have power to determine\r\nthem on payment of compensation for disturbance.\r\n\r\n\r\nA NATIONAL MINING BOARD\r\n\r\nAt the same time a National Mining Board consisting of representatives\r\nof all the interested elements, colliery-owners, managerial and\r\ntechnical staffs, miners, and other grades of workers, and coal\r\nconsumers would be formed (the Mines Department already has a National\r\nAdvisory Committee); the mining engineering element must be strongly\r\nrepresented, and provision must be made for first-class technical advice\r\nbeing always available. It would then be the business of the National\r\nMining Board to work out its policy and decide upon the broad principles\r\nwhich it wishes to weave into the existing structure of the coal-mining\r\nindustry by means of its power of granting leases. The following\r\nprinciples will readily occur to most people, and are supported by\r\nevidence which is, in my humble judgment, convincing, given before the\r\nvarious commissions and committees which have inquired into this\r\nindustry during recent years.\r\n\r\nFirstly, More Amalgamation or Unification of Collieries. At present\r\nthere are about 3000 pits owned by about 1500 companies or individuals,\r\nand producing an aggregate output of about 250 million tons per annum.\r\nAlready there have been many large amalgamations. (i) Many fortunately\r\nsituated small pits making a good profit will be found, but on the whole\r\nsmall collieries are economically unsound. In many cases at present the\r\nunits are too small, having regard to the class of work being done, to\r\nthe cost of up-to-date machinery and upkeep and to the variableness of\r\nthe trade. Broadly I believe it to be true that the larger collieries\r\nare as a general rule more efficient than the smaller ones. (ii) In\r\nrespect of co-operation in pumping, larger units would frequently make\r\nfor efficiency and reduced cost; Sir Richard Redmayne, speaking of South\r\nStaffordshire before the Sankey Commission, said that we had already\r\nlost a large part of that coalfield through disagreement between\r\nneighbouring owners as to pumping. (iii) The advantages of larger units\r\nin facilitating the advantageous buying of timber, ponies, rails,\r\nmachinery and the vast amount of other materials required in a colliery\r\nwill be obvious to most business men.\r\n\r\nI do not propose to chop up the coalfields into mathematical sections\r\nand compulsorily unify the collieries in those sections. I am merely\r\nlaying down the broad principle that to get the best out of our national\r\nasset the National Mining Board must bring about through its power of\r\ngranting leases the formation of larger working units than at present\r\nusually exist. The geological and other conditions in the different\r\ncoalfields vary enormously, and these form a very relevant factor in\r\ndeciding upon the ideal unit of size. It is conceivable that in certain\r\ndistricts all the colliery-owners in the district, with the aid of the\r\nNational Mining Board, would form a statutory company on the lines of\r\nthe District Coal Board, described in the Report made by Sir Arthur\r\nDuckham as a member of the Sankey Commission. One advantage accruing\r\nfrom unification (to which recent events have given more prominence) is\r\nthat it mitigates the tendency for the wages of the district to be just\r\nthose which the worst situated and the worst managed colliery can pay\r\nand yet keep going, and no more. This tendency seems to be recognised\r\nand mitigated in the Agreement of June, 1921, on which the mines are now\r\nbeing worked. Secondly, Provision for Progressive Joint Control, that\r\nis, for enabling all the persons engaged in the mining industry either\r\nin money, in brains, or in manual labour, or a combination of those\r\ninterests, gradually to exercise an effective voice in the direction of\r\ntheir industry.\r\n\r\nSome of the arguments for this principle appear to me to be (i) that, as\r\nindicated in my opening remarks, a sufficiently large number of the\r\nmanual or mainly manual workers in the industry ardently desire a\r\nprogressively effective share in the control of the industry; (ii) that\r\nthis desire is natural and legitimate, having regard to the great\r\nincrease in the education of the workers and the improvement in their\r\nstatus as citizens, and that so far from being repressed it should be\r\nencouraged; (iii) that it is the natural development of the system of\r\nConciliation Boards and (occasionally) Pit Committees which has\r\nprevailed in the industry for many years, though more highly developed\r\nin some parts of the country than others. So far, these organs have been\r\nmainly used for purposes of consultation and negotiation; the time has\r\ncome when with a more representative personnel, while not usurping the\r\nfunctions of a mine manager or, on a larger scale, the managing\r\ndirector, they must be developed so as to exercise some effective share\r\nin controlling the industry. (iv) While working conditions are not so\r\ndangerous and unpleasant as the public are sometimes asked to believe,\r\nthe workers in this industry are exposed to an unusually high risk of\r\ninjury and loss of life, and thus have a very direct interest in\r\ndevising and adopting measures for increased safety. These measures\r\nnearly always mean expenditure, and thus an increased cost of working,\r\nand so long as their adoption (except in so far as made compulsory by\r\nthe Mines Department) rests solely with bodies on which capital alone is\r\nrepresented and labour not at all, there will be fruitful cause for\r\nsuspicion and discontent. The miners are apt to argue that dividends and\r\nsafety precautions are mutually antipathetic, and will continue to do so\r\nas long as they have no part or lot in the reconciliation of these\r\ncompeting obligations. The question is not whether this argument of the\r\nminers is well-founded or not: the point is that their suspicion is\r\nnatural, and any excuse for it should be removed. (v) The exceptionally\r\nlarge items which wages form in the total cost of coal production\r\nindicates the important contribution made by the miners to the welfare\r\nof the industry and justifies some share in the direction of that\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nUpon the basis of typical pre-war years, the value of the labour put\r\ninto the coal mining industry is 70 per cent. of the capital employed,\r\nand 70 per cent. of the annual saleable value of the coal, and yet this\r\nlarge labour interest has no share in the management of the industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MYSTERY AS TO PROFITS\r\n\r\nThirdly, More Financial Publicity. Secrecy as to profits, which always\r\nsuggests that they are as large as to make one ashamed of them, has been\r\nthe bane of the coal-mining industry. For nearly half a century wages\r\nhave borne some relation to _selling prices_, and there have been\r\nquarterly audits of typical selected mines in each district by joint\r\nauditors appointed by the owners and the miners. But over _profits_ a\r\ncurtain was drawn, except in so far as the compulsory filing at Somerset\r\nHouse by public companies of a document called a Statement in the form\r\nof a balance sheet, enabled the curious to draw not very accurate\r\nconclusions. It is not easy for the plain man to read a balance sheet or\r\nestimate profits, especially when shares are being subdivided, or when\r\nbonus shares are being issued, or large sums carried to reserve. The\r\nresult has been continual and natural suspicion on the part of the\r\nminers, who doubtless imagined the colliery-owners' profits to be much\r\nlarger than they were. The miners knew that whenever they asked for an\r\nincrease in their wages they were liable to be told that such an\r\nincrease would turn a moderate profit into a substantial loss, but the\r\namount of the profit they had to take on trust. Selling prices, yes, but\r\nprofits, no.\r\n\r\nThe war and coal control partly killed that, and it must not return. By\r\nthe settlement of June, 1921, for the first time the miners have\r\nestablished the principle of the adjustment of their wages in accordance\r\nwith the proceeds of the industry \"as ascertained by returns to be made\r\nby the owners, checked by a joint test audit of the owners' books\r\ncarried out by independent accountants appointed by each side.\" That is\r\nan important step, but does not go anything like far enough.\r\n\r\nAt least two good results would accrue if colliery-owners conducted\r\ntheir business more in public: (i) a great deal of the suspicion and\r\nmistrust of the miners would be removed, and they would realise why and\r\nwhen their wages must undergo fluctuations, and the value of the many\r\nother factors besides wages which went to make up the pit-head cost of\r\ncoal; (ii) publicity coupled with _costing returns_ would make it\r\npossible to draw comparative conclusions as to the cost of production in\r\ndifferent mines and districts, which would be a fruitful source of\r\nexperiment and improvement. Publicity does not involve publication of\r\nlists of customers, British or foreign.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LESSEES OF THE FUTURE\r\n\r\nHow far will the lessees to whom the National Mining Board will grant\r\nleases to work the coal be the same persons and companies as the present\r\nlessees? In this matter it is desirable to maintain the maximum amount\r\nof flexibility and variety. I do not think we have yet discovered the\r\nideal unit, the ideal organisation for the development of our principal\r\nnational asset. So much do our coalfields differ in geological\r\nformation, in tradition, in the subdivision and classification of\r\nlabour, in outlet for trade, that it is unlikely that any single unit or\r\norganisation will be the ideal one for every coalfield. So we must\r\nresist any attempt, especially an early attempt, at stereotyping or\r\nstandardising the type of lessee. By trial and error we shall learn\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nAll the following types of lessee seem likely, sooner or later, to\r\ndemand the attention of the National Mining Board. (I shall not touch on\r\nthe question of distribution, inland and export. That is another and\r\nquite separate question):--\r\n\r\n(i) _The Present Lessees._--I see no reason to doubt that in the vast\r\nmajority of cases the present lessees would be prepared to continue to\r\noperate their mines, paying royalties to the State instead of to the\r\npresent royalty-owner. Where the unit is sufficiently large and the\r\nmanagement efficient, the National Mining Board would probably grant a\r\nfresh lease, incorporating such conditions as to unification, joint\r\ncontrol, and publicity as they might consider necessary. If the present\r\nlessees do not want the lease, there are others who will.\r\n\r\n(ii) _Larger Groups._--In a great many cases, however, the Board would\r\ndecline to grant separate leases in respect of each of a number of small\r\ncollieries, and would indicate that they were only prepared to receive\r\napplications for leases by groups of persons or companies prepared to\r\namalgamate themselves into a corporation representing an output of x\r\ntons _per annum_. This figure would vary in each coalfield. In South\r\nStaffordshire, in particular, divided ownership has had most prejudicial\r\neffects in the matter of pumping.\r\n\r\n(iii) _District Coal Boards._--Sir Arthur Duckham's scheme of statutory\r\ncompanies known as District Coal Boards requires consideration. Without\r\nnecessarily adopting his districts or his uniformity of type throughout\r\nthe country, there are many areas where it might be found that voluntary\r\namalgamation was impracticable, and that the desired result could only\r\nbe attained by an Act of Parliament providing for the compulsory\r\namalgamation of persons and companies working a specified area and the\r\nissue of shares in the new corporation in exchange for the previous\r\nholdings.\r\n\r\n(iv) _Public Authorities._--I should very much like to see, sooner or\r\nlater, in some area, a lessee in the form of an organisation which,\r\nthough not national--not the State--should be at any rate\r\npublic--something on the lines of the Port of London Authority.\r\n\r\nIt may well be that in one or more of our coalfields a public authority\r\nof this type, though with larger labour representation upon it and with\r\na large measure of joint control from top to bottom, would be a\r\nsuitable lessee of the minerals in that area. The important point is\r\nthat public management need not mean bureaucratic State-management with\r\nthe disadvantages popularly associated with it.\r\n\r\n(v) I have mentioned several types of possible lessees, but it will be\r\nnoticed that there is nothing in these suggestions which would prevent\r\nthe National Mining Board from making the experiment of working a few\r\nmines themselves.\r\n\r\nTo sum up. There _is_ a problem of the Mines. No sensible person should\r\nbe deceived by the quiescence of the last twelve abnormal months.\r\nWithout using extravagant language, the coal-mining industry is a\r\nvolcano liable at any moment to erupt and involve the whole community in\r\nloss and suffering. Therefore, as a body of citizens, we are under a\r\nduty to seek a solution which can be effected between the occurrence of\r\nthe recurring crises. As a body of Liberal citizens we shall naturally\r\nseek a Liberal solution, and the foregoing suggestions (for which no\r\noriginality is claimed) are inspired by the Liberal point of view. They\r\napply to the industrial sphere principles which have been tried and\r\nproved in the political sphere, both in the central and the local\r\ngovernment. Apart from State acquisition of the minerals, about which\r\nthere can surely be no question, these suggestions merely develop\r\ntendencies and organisations already existing within the industry. They\r\ninvolve no leap in the dark, such as has been attributed by some to\r\nnationalisation of the whole industry, and they provide for great\r\nflexibility and experimentation. The fact that the official spokesmen of\r\nneither miners nor colliery-owners may like them need not deter us. They\r\nhave had numerous opportunities of settling the problem amongst\r\nthemselves, but the \"die-hards\" in both camps have always prevented it.\r\nIt is time that the general public outside the industry took the matter\r\nin hand and propounded a solution likely to be acceptable to the vast\r\nbody of sensible and central feeling within the industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAND QUESTION\r\n\r\nBY A.S. COMYNS CARR\r\n\r\nMember of Acquisition of Land Committee, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Comyns Carr said:--The Land Question I believe to be the most\r\nimportant subject in purely domestic politics to-day, as it was in 1914.\r\nAt that date we were embarking, under the especial leadership of one who\r\nhas now deserted us, upon a comprehensive campaign dealing with that\r\nquestion in all its aspects. The present Government has filled a large\r\nportion of the Statute Book with legislation bearing on the land; it is\r\nnot the quantity we have to complain of, but the quality. In 1914 we had\r\nalready achieved one signal victory in carrying against the House of\r\nLords the Land Clauses of the Budget of 1909-10, and although many of us\r\nwere never satisfied with the form which those clauses took, they were\r\nvaluable both as a step in the direction of land taxation and for the\r\nmachinery of valuation which they established. Mr. Lloyd George in his\r\npresent alliance with the Tories has sunk so low as not only to repeal\r\nthose clauses, but actually to refund to the landlords every penny which\r\nthey have paid in taxation under them.\r\n\r\nThe campaign which was inaugurated in 1913 did not deal with the\r\nquestion of taxation only, and for my part, although I am an enthusiast\r\non this branch of the subject, I have never thought that other aspects\r\nshould be neglected. We put forward proposals for dealing with leases\r\nboth in town and country. The present Government has carried and\r\nrepealed again a series of statutes dealing with agriculture. Their\r\noriginal policy was to offer to the farmer guaranteed prices for his\r\nproduce, if necessary at the expense of the tax-payer, and to the\r\nlabourer guaranteed wages, to be fixed and enforced by Wages Boards.\r\nBefore this policy was fully in operation it was repealed. The farmer\r\ngot some cash compensation for his losses; the labourer has got nothing\r\nbut voluntary Conciliation Boards, with no power to do more than pass\r\npious resolutions. There has, however, survived this welter of\r\ncontradictory legislation, a series of clauses which do confer upon the\r\ntenant farmer a substantial part of the rights in his dealings with his\r\nlandlord for which we were agitating in 1914. The town lease-holder, on\r\nthe other hand, has got nothing, and it is one of the first duties of\r\nthe Liberal Party to provide him with security against the confiscation\r\nof his improvements and goodwill, to give him reasonable security of\r\ntenure, and to put an end once for all to the pestilent system of\r\nbuilding leases which extends all over London and to about half the\r\nother towns of England. The evils of this system are especially to be\r\nfound in those older parts of our great cities where the original leases\r\nare drawing to a close. In such cases a kind of blight appears to settle\r\non whole neighbourhoods, and no improvements can be carried out by\r\neither party because the landlord cannot obtain possession, and the\r\ntenant has not, and is unable to obtain, a sufficient length of term to\r\nmake it worth his while to risk his capital upon them.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSING\r\n\r\nThe branch of the land question to which the Government called the\r\ngreatest attention in their election promises was Housing. On this\r\nsubject the Government have placed many pages of legislation on the\r\nStatute Book. One can only wish that the houses occupied as much space.\r\nThey began by informing us, probably accurately, that up to the time of\r\nthe Armistice there was an accumulated shortage of 500,000 houses; in\r\npre-war days new working-class houses were required, and to a certain\r\nextent provided, although the shortage had then already begun, to an\r\naverage number of 90,000 a year. According to the official figures in\r\nJuly last, 123,000 houses had been completed by Local Authorities and\r\nPublic Utility Societies; 37,000 by private builders with Government\r\nsubsidies; 36,000 were under construction, and as the Government have\r\nnow limited the total scheme (thereby causing the resignation of Dr.\r\nAddison, its sponsor) there remain 17,000 to be built. This is the\r\nrecord of four years, so clearly the Government have not even succeeded\r\nin keeping pace with the normal annual demand, and the shortage has not\r\nbeen attacked, but actually accentuated.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the failure was mainly financial. Without attacking the\r\nroots of the evil in our land and rating system, and without attempting\r\nto control the output and supply of materials and building in the way in\r\nwhich munitions were controlled during the war, the Government brought\r\nforward gigantic schemes to be financed from the supposedly bottomless\r\npurse of the tax-payer. At the same time the demand for building\r\nmaterials and labour in every direction was at its maximum, and\r\nunfortunately both employers and employed in the building and allied\r\nindustries took the fullest advantage of the position to force up prices\r\nwithout regard to the unfortunate people who wanted houses. The Trade\r\nUnions concerned seem to have overlooked the fact that if wages were\r\nraised and output reduced houses would become so dear that their\r\nfellow-workmen who needed them could not attempt to pay the rents\r\nrequired, and the tax-payer would revolt against the burdens imposed\r\nupon him; thus the golden era for their own trade was bound to come to a\r\nrapid end, and, so far from employment being increased and prolonged,\r\nunemployment on a large scale was bound to result. With the Anti-Waste\r\npanic and the Geddes Axe, social reform was cut first, and, in their\r\nhurry to stop the provision of homes for heroes, the Government is\r\nindulging in such false economies as leaving derelict land acquired and\r\nlaid out at enormous cost, even covering over excavations already made,\r\nand paying out to members of the building trade large sums in\r\nunemployment benefit, while the demand for the houses on which they\r\nmight be employed is left wholly unsatisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAND FOR PUBLIC PURPOSES\r\n\r\nThe Acquisition and Valuation of Land for the purpose of public\r\nimprovements is a branch of the question to which a great deal of\r\nattention was drawn during and immediately after the war. The Government\r\nappointed a Committee, of which the present Solicitor-General was\r\nchairman, and which, in spite of a marked scarcity of advanced land\r\nreformers amongst its members, produced a series of remarkably unanimous\r\nand far-reaching recommendations. These recommendations dealt with four\r\nmain topics:--\r\n\r\n(_a_) Improvements in the machinery by which powers may be obtained by\r\npublic and private bodies for the acquisition of land for improvements\r\nof a public character;\r\n\r\n(_b_) Valuation of land which it is proposed to acquire;\r\n\r\n(_c_) Fair adjustment as between these bodies and the owners of other\r\nland, both of claims by owners for damage done by the undertaking to\r\nother lands, and of claims by the promoting bodies for increased value\r\ngiven by their undertaking to other lands; and\r\n\r\n(_d_) The application of these principles to the special subject of\r\nmining.\r\n\r\nThe Government in the Acquisition of Land Act, 1919, has adopted a great\r\npart of the Committee's recommendations under the second head, and this\r\nAct has undoubtedly effected an enormous improvement in the prices paid\r\nby public bodies for land which they require, although, most\r\nunfortunately, the same immunity from the extortion of the land-owner\r\nand the land speculator has not been extended to private bodies such as\r\nrailway companies who need land for the improvement of public services.\r\nMoreover, it has not attempted to bring the purchase price of land into\r\nany relation with its taxing valuation.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the rest of the Committee's recommendations dealing with\r\nthe other three points which I have mentioned, the Government has wholly\r\nignored. Powers for public development can still only be obtained by the\r\nslow, costly and antiquated processes in vogue before the war; private\r\nowners of lands adjoining works of a public character are still in a\r\nposition to put into their own pockets large increases in value due to\r\npublic improvements to which they have contributed nothing, and which\r\nthey may even have impeded; the development of minerals is still\r\nhampered by the veto of unreasonable owners, by the necessity of leaving\r\nunnecessary barriers between different properties, and by other\r\nobstacles which were dealt with in detail in the Committee's report. An\r\nillustration of the importance of this aspect of the question was put\r\nbefore the Committee and has been emphasised by recent events. It was\r\nstated on behalf of the railway companies that they were prepared with\r\nschemes for the extension of their systems in various parts of the\r\ncountry, which would not only provide temporary employment for a large\r\nnumber of men on construction, and permanent employment to a smaller\r\nnumber on the working of the lines, but would also open up new\r\nresidential and industrial districts, but that it was impossible for\r\nthem to find the necessary funds unless they could have some guarantee\r\nthat at least any loss upon the cost of construction would be charged\r\nupon the increased value of land in the new districts which would be\r\ncreated by the railway extensions. Remarkable instances were given of\r\nthe way in which the value of land had been multiplied many-fold by the\r\npromotion of new railways, which, nevertheless, had never succeeded in\r\npaying a dividend to their shareholders, and the capital cost of which\r\nhad been practically lost.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Committee were assured that, given a charge on\r\nthe increased value of land likely to be created, there would be no\r\ndifficulty in obtaining the necessary funds without Government\r\nassistance. When the pressure of the unemployment problem became acute,\r\nand not before--and then it was, of course, too late--the Government\r\nturned their attention to this problem, and have guaranteed the interest\r\nupon new capital to be expended on a few of these railway extensions,\r\nbut instead of charging the guarantee upon the increased value of land,\r\nthey have charged it upon the pocket of the tax-payer. The most striking\r\ninstance is that of the tube railway from Charing Cross to Golders\r\nGreen, now being extended under Government guarantee to Edgware. Those\r\nwho provided the original capital have never received any return upon\r\ntheir money, yet millions have been put into the pockets of the owners\r\nof what was undeveloped land now served by the line, and now that the\r\nextension is being carried out with the tax-payers' guarantee, the\r\nland-owners will again reap the benefit untaxed.\r\n\r\nThe development of the natural resources of our country was one of the\r\npromises held out by Mr. Lloyd George to the electors in 1918. Schemes\r\nwere ready, and are still in the official pigeon-holes, for the\r\nproduction of electricity on a very large scale both from water power\r\nand from coal, which would not only provide employment, but cheapen the\r\ncost of production in all our industries. France, Italy, and other\r\ncountries are at this moment carrying out similar schemes whereby they\r\nwill relieve themselves to a large extent from dependence on British\r\ncoal. But here, four years of Coalition Government have left us\r\npractically where we were. In France, although in many respects her\r\nsocial system seems to me less enlightened than our own, the power of\r\nthe land-owner to obstruct enterprise and development is by no means so\r\ngreat. Land Reform in this country is a necessary preliminary to the\r\nfulfilment of Mr. Lloyd George's promises. Development at the public\r\nexpense without such reforms will result chiefly in further burdens upon\r\nthe tax-payer and further enrichment of the landowner.\r\n\r\n\r\nRATING RELIEF FOR IMPROVEMENTS\r\n\r\nThis brings me to the last, and in my opinion the most important branch\r\nof the Land Question, that relating to the reform of our system of\r\nrating and taxation. I am myself an ardent supporter of the policy which\r\nI think has been rather unfortunately named the Taxation of Land\r\nValues. The vital point about this policy is not so much that we should\r\ntax land values, as that we should leave off taxing buildings and other\r\nimprovements of land. The policy would be better described as the Relief\r\nof Improvements from Taxation. Its economic merits seem to me so obvious\r\nas hardly to require examination. It is only because the present system\r\nhas been in force for over 300 years that it can find any supporters. If\r\nany one were to propose as a useful means of encouraging the steel trade\r\nor the boot trade, or as a desirable method of taxation, that a tax of,\r\nsay, 50 per cent. should be imposed upon the value of every ton of steel\r\nor every pair of boots turned out in our factories, he would be rightly\r\nand universally denounced as a lunatic. Yet this is the system which\r\never since the days of Queen Elizabeth has been in force with regard to\r\nthe building trade and all other industries which result in the\r\nproduction of improvements upon land.\r\n\r\nAs long as land remains unused it pays no rates or taxes, whatever its\r\nimmediate potential value. But the moment it is brought into use, as\r\nsoon as a house, a factory, or a railway is built upon it, or it is\r\ndrained or planted--rates and taxes, which in these days often exceed 50\r\nper cent. of its improved value, have to be paid, without regard even to\r\nthe question whether its use is successful in yielding profits or not.\r\nFamiliarity with this system, instead of breeding the contempt which it\r\ndeserves, has bred a kind of passive acquiescence which is exceedingly\r\ndifficult to shake. Even such a champion of our land system as the Duke\r\nof Bedford years ago in his book, _The Story of a Great Agricultural\r\nEstate_, perceived the absurdity, although he was apparently blind to\r\nthe remedy and to the application of it to some of his estates which are\r\nnot agricultural. He converted an ordinary arable field into a fruit\r\ngarden, and discovered that his rates were promptly trebled by reason of\r\nhis expenditure. Striking, but, nevertheless, everyday examples may be\r\nfound if we see how the system works out in urban districts. If a new\r\nfactory is built, rates and taxes are immediately levied on the full\r\nannual value of the building, which is a direct charge upon production,\r\nand has to be paid before a single person can be employed in the\r\nfactory. It therefore not only restricts the possibilities of\r\nemployment, but has to be added to the price at which the goods can be\r\nsold.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LESSON OF THE SLUMS\r\n\r\nOr take the illustration of a slum area. Each tumble-down tenement is\r\nrated and taxed on the assessment based upon its annual rental value. In\r\nmany places in the central parts of towns the total of these assessments\r\nis less than the sum for which the whole site could be sold as a\r\nbuilding area, nevertheless if all the tenements fall or are pulled down\r\nthe site may remain vacant for years and no rates or taxes are paid. But\r\nif substantial and decent buildings are erected on the site, immediately\r\nthe assessment is raised to their full annual value. The individual or\r\npublic body that has cleared away the slum and erected something decent\r\nin its place is thus immediately punished for doing so, with the result\r\nthat such a thing is seldom done except at the public expense. The\r\nremedy for all these absurdities is quite a simple one. No one disputes\r\nthat the sums necessary for municipal and imperial taxation have got to\r\nbe provided. The question is, in so far as they are to be raised from\r\nlands and buildings, how can they be assessed most fairly and with the\r\nleast injury to trade and commerce? They should be assessed upon the\r\nvalue of land which is not due to any effort of the owner or occupier;\r\nthey should not be assessed upon nor increased because of any buildings\r\nwhich he may have erected or any improvements which he may have carried\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThis question was closely investigated by the Land Enquiry Committee\r\nappointed by Mr. Lloyd George in 1913. They were unanimous in condemning\r\nthe existing system and in regarding the one which I have just described\r\nas the ideal. They were, however, met by great difficulties in its\r\nimmediate practical application, because, owing to the long prevalence\r\nof the wrong system, an immediate and total change would bring about\r\nrather startling alterations in the value of existing properties. The\r\nCommittee closely considered these objections, and a number of\r\nalternative methods of bringing the change into operation gradually and\r\nwithout these drastic changes in value were put forward. The one which\r\nimmediately suggested itself as the simplest, and from many points of\r\nview the most desirable, was to leave the rates and taxes of existing\r\nproperties on their present basis, to impose them at their present rate\r\non the annual value of all unoccupied land, but to exempt from rates and\r\ntaxes all future buildings and improvements of every kind.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the way in which this would work, let us revert to the\r\ncase of a block of slum property. As long as it remained in its present\r\ncondition the existing valuation based upon the annual rent obtainable\r\nfor it would apply, but any parts of it which now are or may hereafter\r\nbecome unoccupied, would, instead of escaping as they do now from all\r\nrates and taxes, contribute on the basis of the value of their sites,\r\nwhich would be assessed at an annual rent for the purpose of comparison\r\nwith the existing valuations, at least until the capital values of the\r\nwhole rating area could be ascertained. If any improvements were carried\r\nout the assessments would not be raised on that account, as they would\r\nbe under present conditions, and if a whole area were pulled down,\r\nreplanned and rebuilt, the assessment instead of being based, as it\r\nwould be to-day, on the annual value of the reconstructed property,\r\nwould be based upon the site value alone. Gradually in this way site\r\nvalue would become the prevalent basis of assessment. \"It is obvious,\"\r\nas the Committee said in 1913, \"that unrating of future improvements is\r\nfrom the economic point of view of far more importance than the unrating\r\nof existing improvements; if we want to encourage new buildings and new\r\nimprovements, what is really important is to ensure that new\r\nimprovements (not old ones) shall be exempt from the burden of rates.\"\r\nThe Committee were, however, compelled to reject this suggestion at that\r\ntime on the ground that \"it would cause an unfair differentiation\r\nbetween the man who had already put up buildings or improvements, and\r\nthe man who put up buildings or improvements after the passing of the\r\nAct.\" But as between buildings and improvements which existed before the\r\nwar and those which come into existence under post-war conditions no\r\nsuch unfairness could operate, because the increase in the cost of\r\nbuilding even to-day is greater than the benefit which would accrue from\r\nthe unrating of improvements. The present is therefore the unique\r\nopportunity for bringing into force this much-needed reform in the most\r\neffective way, free from the difficulties which had to be met in 1913.\r\nIf it had been carried out immediately after the Armistice it would, in\r\nmy opinion, have done more than anything else to solve the housing\r\nproblem, and even now it is not too late. In fact, in view of the\r\npresent unemployment it would be most opportune. Incidentally it would\r\nsoon render unnecessary the renewal of the Rent Restriction Act. I\r\nunderstand that something on these lines has been introduced in New York\r\nto meet a similar problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nA RATE AND A TAX UPON SITE VALUES\r\n\r\nThe Committee of 1913 were obliged to turn their attention to other\r\nsuggestions. They proposed:\r\n\r\n(_a_) That all future increases in the expenditure of each Local\r\nAuthority which had to be met out of rates should be met by a rate upon\r\nsite values instead of upon the existing assessments; and\r\n\r\n(_b_) That existing expenditure should be met to a small extent\r\ncompulsorily, and to a larger extent at the option of the Local\r\nAuthority, in the same manner.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason why these proposals should not be brought into force\r\nsimultaneously with that relating to new buildings and improvements.\r\nThey made these proposals conditional upon a substantial increase in the\r\ngrants in aid to Local Authorities, especially in necessitous areas,\r\nfrom the Imperial Exchequer; and they suggested, although they did not\r\ndefinitely recommend, that a part at least of this increased grant might\r\nbe raised by means of an additional tax upon site values. This, I think,\r\nshould certainly be done, and such a tax might be wholly or partially\r\nsubstituted for the present Land Tax and Income-Tax Schedule A, which\r\nare assessed on the wrong basis.\r\n\r\nThese proposals would, of course, involve the revival and revision of\r\nthe National Land Valuation established by the Finance Act, 1909-10,\r\nwhich should be made the basis of all taxation and rating relating to\r\nreal property. This would be both a reform and an economy, because there\r\nare at present several overlapping systems of valuation by Central and\r\nLocal Authorities, none of which are really satisfactory even on the\r\npresent unsatisfactory basis of assessment. The existence of such a\r\nvaluation frequently revised and kept up to date, and independent of\r\nlocal influences, would be invaluable not only for purposes of rating\r\nand taxation, but also in arriving at a fair price for the acquisition\r\nof land for public purposes, and for the levying of special charges upon\r\nthe increased value due to particular public improvements, such as\r\nrailway extensions, with which I have already dealt.\r\n\r\nI am not one of those who claim for these reforms that they would cure\r\nall the evils from which the community is at present suffering, but I do\r\nbelieve that there is no other and no better way of removing the\r\nunfairness and the restrictions of our present methods of rating and\r\ntaxation or of setting free and stimulating the energies of our people\r\nin the development of the resources of our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nBY RT. HON. F.D. ACLAND\r\n\r\nP.C.; M.P. (L.) North-West Cornwall; Financial Secretary, War Office,\r\n1908-10; Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, 1911-15;\r\nFinancial Secretary to Treasury, Feb.-June, 1915; Secretary to the Board\r\nof Agriculture, 1915-16; a Forestry Commissioner. Chairman of the\r\nAgricultural Organisation Society.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Acland said:--I begin by laying down in a didactic form five points\r\nwhich one would like to see firmly established in our rural life: (i)\r\nintensive production; (ii) plenty of employment at good wages; (iii)\r\neasy access to land, and a good chance of rising upon the land; (iv)\r\nreal independence in rural life; (v) co-operative association for many\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nIntensive production is most important. It is so easy to say the farmer\r\n_can_ get more out of the land, and the farmer _should_ get more out of\r\nthe land, that we are tempted to continue and say that the farmer _must\r\nbe made_ to get more out of the land. But it isn't so easy. It has been\r\ntried and failed, and when any subject in our British political life has\r\nbeen brought up to the boiling-point, and yet nothing effective has been\r\ndone, it is extremely difficult to bring it to the boil a second time.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while tracing out what has actually happened. The\r\nGovernment's Agriculture Act of 1921 contained four great\r\nprinciples:--(i) that we must have more food produced in this country\r\n(_a_) as an insurance against risk of war, (_b_) so as to meet our\r\npost-war conditions as a debtor nation by importing less of our food\r\nsupplies; (ii) that as the most productive farming is arable farming,\r\nand as by maintaining a proper proportion of arable we can on emergency\r\nmake ourselves independent for our food supplies for an indefinite time,\r\nfarmers should be guaranteed against loss on their arable rotations;\r\n(iii) that if farmers are to be required to produce more they must have\r\nclear legal rights to farm their land in the most productive way, a\r\ngreater compensation for disturbance; (iv) that as the first three\r\nprinciples give security to the nation and to the farmer, it is\r\ndesirable also to give security to the worker by permanently continuing\r\nthe war-time system of Agricultural Wages Boards.\r\n\r\nThese principles were duly embodied in the Bill as it left the House of\r\nCommons:--\r\n\r\n(i) The Ministry of Agriculture, acting through the County Agricultural\r\nCommittees, was given powers to insist on a certain standard of arable\r\ncultivation, as well as in minor matters, such as control of weeds and\r\nof rabbits;\r\n\r\n(ii) The difference between the ascertained market price and the\r\nestimated cost of production on his wheat and oat acreage was guaranteed\r\nto the farmer, the guarantee not to be altered except after four years'\r\nnotice;\r\n\r\n(iii) The landlord had to forfeit a year's rent if a tenant was\r\ndisturbed except for bad farming, or four years' rent if the disturbance\r\nwas capricious;\r\n\r\n(iv) The existing Wages Board system was continued.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DESTRUCTION OF A POLICY\r\n\r\nThe gradual destruction of this policy began in the House of Lords. They\r\nallowed themselves to be swept away by the popular cry against\r\nGovernment interference with industry, and cut out the power of control\r\nof cultivation. The Prime Minister had said that this was an absolutely\r\nessential part of the Bill, and of the Government's policy, but the\r\nGovernment quietly and characteristically accepted the Lords' amendment\r\nand the Bill was passed.\r\n\r\nThen troubles began. Other industries began to ask why the Government\r\nsatisfied agriculture and not them, and as the Government could not\r\nplead their control of agriculture in justification, no real reply was\r\npossible. Also the cold fit came on as regards national expenditure. The\r\nBill for the corn subsidies threatened to be very high. Though Europe\r\nwas starving, it could not buy, so cheap American grain flooded our\r\nmarkets; but cost of production here was still at its peak, and, for\r\noats especially, the amount to be paid to the farmer threatened to be\r\nlarge. It was realised that it might cost 25-30 millions to implement\r\nthe guarantees for the first year, and perhaps 10-12 millions a year\r\nlater. In short, the guarantees had to go. Instead of four years' notice\r\nof any change, a Bill to repeal the great Act was introduced five months\r\nafter it had been passed. And it was unfortunately part of the bargain\r\nwith the farmers who received for the single season perhaps six or\r\neight millions less than they might have been entitled to under the Act,\r\nthat the Wages Boards should be abolished--and they were. There remained\r\nof the original structure only the depreciation of the value of all\r\nagricultural landowners' property by about one-twentieth, owing to the\r\nextra compensation for disturbance.\r\n\r\nEvery one felt that they had been had, and they had been. The industry\r\nwhich had lately been talked up and made much of was dumped into the\r\ndustbin. The farmers had lost their guarantees on the strength of which,\r\nin many cases, they had bought their farms dear or planned their\r\nrotations. The labourers, who particularly needed the protection of\r\nWages Boards during a time of fall in cost of living and unemployment,\r\nhad lost all legal protection. The landlords, willing enough to give\r\nwhat was asked of them if any national purpose was to be served, found\r\nthat their loss brought no corresponding national gain. Agriculture\r\nretired as far as it could from any contact with perfidious Governments,\r\nto lick its wounds.\r\n\r\nThat is not a good basis upon which to build intensive cultivation or\r\nany other active policy. There being now no legal or patriotic call to\r\nintensive production, we are driven back to ask, \"Does intensive\r\nproduction pay?\" and the broad answer is that at a time of low prices it\r\ndoes not. There is no doubt that slowly and steadily education will\r\ngradually improve farming, and that farmers will learn to find out what\r\nparts of their business pay best and to concentrate upon them. There is\r\nalso no doubt that even at low prices there is plenty of scope for\r\nbetter farming, and that better manuring, particularly of grass land,\r\nwill pay. But the farmer is faced with an economic principle--the law of\r\ndiminishing returns. It may be stated thus: beyond a certain point which\r\nrises and falls directly with the value of the product, extra doses of\r\nlabour and manure do not give a corresponding return. It is this\r\nprinciple which accounts for what we see everywhere--that farmers are\r\ntending to economise as much as they can on their labour and to let\r\narable land go back to grass.\r\n\r\nAnd if this is clear to farmers who are thinking of intensive arable\r\nfarming, still more is it true in comparing arable with grass. If you\r\ntake the same sort of quantity of arable and grass farms, farmed by men\r\nof the same skill and diligence, over a range of seasons under low world\r\nprices for farm produce, you will, I believe, find something like this:\r\ngrass land needs half the capital and one-third of the labour of arable;\r\nit produces three-quarters the receipts with half the payments, and\r\nyields double the profit per acre and four times the profit on capital.\r\nThe moral of all this is clear. Unless the nation is willing to go back\r\nto protection for agriculture, which I am glad to believe in the general\r\ninterest unthinkable, and unless it is willing to guarantee the farmer\r\nagainst loss from that method of agriculture which means most production\r\nand most employment, we must let the farmer set the tune and farm in the\r\nway it best suits him to farm. We must try, in fact, not to talk too\r\nmuch nonsense about intensive production as the cure for agricultural\r\ndepression. It is useful to remember that all countries overseas which\r\ncombine high wages with agricultural prosperity have a very low output\r\nper acre judged by our standards.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMPLOYMENT AND WAGES\r\n\r\nIt follows directly from what I have just said that a time of high costs\r\nand low prices like the present, like the time of lower costs but still\r\nlower prices of the late '80's and early '90's, is not a favourable time\r\nfor expecting employment to be brisk or wages high. And reasons other\r\nthan those which we have yet considered make the farmer feel his labour\r\nto be specially burdensome at present. He finds that the prices he gets\r\non the average are one and one-third times what they were before the\r\nwar: what he has to buy costing from one and a half to one and\r\ntwo-thirds what it cost before the war; and he is expected in very many\r\ncounties in England and Wales to pay his workers about double what he\r\npaid before the war. This is a strong point for him. But the labourers'\r\nposition is just as strong. \"I was not sufficiently well paid before the\r\nwar. If this is to be recognised in any way at all, I must at the\r\npresent cost of living (185) have double my pre-war wages.\" It is\r\ncertainly beyond all question that 30/- a week, which is the present\r\nwage over a large part of England, is not, even with only 3/- a week\r\nrent for house and garden, enough to keep a man and his wife and family\r\nin a state of real efficiency. Yet I know from personal experience that\r\nthis fact is not properly recognised in practice. If one tries to pay\r\nmore one is regarded as a very rich man, and an extremely stupid one--an\r\nidea erroneous as to one's wealth and possibly exaggerated as to one's\r\nmentality.\r\n\r\nHow have the two conflicting views of farmer and labourer been\r\nreconciled in practice. I can only say that so far as my own knowledge\r\nextends--bearing in mind that the farmer has not the business man's\r\nhabit of cheerfully setting off a bad year against a good (for the\r\nbusiness man knows that trade must improve some time, and then he will\r\nmake profits, while the farmer has no certainty that things will\r\nimprove)--things might well have been worse. There has been a good deal\r\nof mutual consideration and desire to make the best of difficult\r\ncircumstances. I have, however, little doubt that it would have been\r\nbetter had the Wages Boards, which had controlled the rise in wages\r\nduring the rise in the cost of living, regulated the fall in wages\r\nduring its fall--relaxing control perhaps later when things became more\r\nstable.\r\n\r\nThe reason why I think that things might have been worse is that the\r\nDistrict Wages Committee left a good legacy to the voluntary\r\nConciliation Committees which followed them--the men serving on the\r\nlatter were those who under the Wages Board system had learned to\r\nnegotiate with and to know and respect the workers--generally some of\r\nthe best farmers in their districts--and they genuinely tried not to let\r\nthe workers down with too much of a bump; on the other hand, they knew\r\nthat the only value their recommendations could have was that they\r\nshould be voluntarily observed, and therefore they took care not to\r\nrecommend rates higher than those which the least favourably situated\r\nfarmers in the district could manage to pay--which meant rates lower\r\nthan many might have been willing to give. This means that any general\r\nrate agreed to voluntarily will be rather on the low side. But I would\r\nrather have a rate which is generally observed, even if it is rather\r\nlow, than that every farmer should be a law unto himself. If there is no\r\nrecognised standard, and one man with impunity pays a lower rate than\r\nhis neighbours, other rates also tend to come down, and then the process\r\nbegins over again.\r\n\r\nLooking to the future, the only thing that I can say with any certainty\r\nabout the wages question is that it needs very careful watching. Let us\r\nbe sure first of our principle, that the first charge on land, as on any\r\nother industry, should be a reasonable standard of living for the\r\nworkers. Then let us be sure of the fact that there is over a very large\r\npart of England and Wales no certain prospect of an improvement in the\r\ncondition of the labourer compared with conditions ten years ago. The\r\ndangers to be feared are that in the present lamentable weakness of the\r\nmen's unions large sections of farmers may break away from the\r\nrecommendations of their leaders; and that if depression continues and\r\nwar savings become depleted farmers will tend to push wages down in\r\nself-preservation. These things must be watched. If the general\r\ncondition of agriculture improves without a corresponding improvement in\r\nthe workers' condition, or if conditions get worse and the brunt of the\r\nburden is transferred to the labourer, we ought to be prepared to\r\nadvocate a return to the old Wages Boards or the adoption of a Trade\r\nBoard system. It must, I think, be a cardinal point of our Liberal faith\r\nthat though it is better to leave industrial questions to be adjusted as\r\nmuch as possible by the parties concerned in the industry, the State\r\nmust be ready to step in in any case in which the workers have not\r\ndeveloped the power by their own combination to secure reasonable\r\nconditions and prospects. It is to the prospects that I now turn.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCESS TO THE LAND\r\n\r\nI mean by this that there should be as many chances as possible for men\r\nand women who have an inclination for country pursuits to take up\r\ncultivation of the soil; the freest opportunity for experiment in making\r\na living out of the land; and good chances for those who have started on\r\nthe land ladder to rise to the top of it.\r\n\r\nThe three things which stand in the way are:--\r\n\r\n(i) The cost of building and equipment;\r\n\r\n(ii) The practice under which the cultivator provides all the movable\r\ncapital;\r\n\r\n(iii) The handicap on free use of land imposed upon its owners by the\r\ncompensation clauses of the Agriculture Act.\r\n\r\nThese obstacles do real harm, in the first place, because a very large\r\nproportion of farms in this country are the wrong size: too large for a\r\nman to work with his hands, and too much for him to work with his head,\r\nas Sir Thomas Middleton has well said. Figures show quite conclusively\r\nthat whether you take production per acre or production per man, the\r\nfarm of from 100 to 150 acres is economically the worst-sized unit.\r\nProbably more than half of our farms lie between 70 and 100 acres. We\r\nshould get far more out of the land if all were either below 80--so that\r\na man and his family could manage them--or above 180, so that there\r\nwould be a chance of applying to production the most scientific methods\r\nand up-to-date machinery.\r\n\r\nBut movement, either towards breaking up existing holdings or throwing\r\nthem together, will be extremely slow. The one process means building\r\nnew houses and buildings, which is prohibitive in price; and the other,\r\nalso fresh building and the abandonment of hearths and homes, which is\r\nprohibited both by price and by sentiment. Any change in either\r\ndirection is almost prohibitive to the new poor landowner class, because\r\nif one makes any change, except when a tenant dies or moves of his own\r\naccord, one forfeits a year's rent.\r\n\r\nI have not yet mentioned the difficulty about capital. Under our British\r\nmethod, if a man wants a farm he must have capital--about £10 per arable\r\nacre and about £5 for grass. This is a great bar to freedom of\r\nexperiment and the greatest bar on the way up the agricultural ladder.\r\nThere ought to be free access to our farms by town brains, which can\r\noften strike out new and profitable lines if given a chance. It is not\r\ngood for agriculture, and it does not promote that sympathy and contact\r\nand interchange which should exist between town and country, that a\r\nstart in farming should need a heavy supply of capital. If our\r\nlandlords were better off they might well try some of the continental\r\nsystems, under which the landlord provides not only the farm and\r\nbuildings, but the stock and equipment, and receives in addition to a\r\nfair rent for the land half the profits of the farm. But it is vain to\r\nhope for this under present conditions, and, for good or ill, the newly\r\nrich does not buy land. He knows too much, and he can get what he wants\r\nwithout it. He may lease a house, he does take shooting, but he won't\r\nbuy an estate.\r\n\r\nWhen thinking of the importance of freedom of experiment and of a ladder\r\nwith no missing rungs, I have my mind on the possibility of the owner of\r\none estate of from 5,000 to 10,000 acres throwing all the farms and many\r\nof the fields together and making his best tenants fellow-directors with\r\nhim of a joint enterprise, one doing the buying and selling, one looking\r\nafter the power and the tractors and implements, one planning the\r\nagricultural processes, one directing the labour and so on. This gives a\r\nprospect of the greatest production and the greatest profit, and it\r\ngives a really good labourer a chance which at present he has not got.\r\nAt present, unless he leaves the land, in nine cases out of ten once a\r\nlabourer always a labourer. My vision would give him a chance to become,\r\nfirst, foreman, then assistant manager, manager, director, and\r\nmanaging-director. It ought to be tried--but how one's tenants would\r\nloathe it, and quite natural too! At present if things go wrong, if it's\r\nnot the fault of the Government or the weather, it's the farmer's own\r\nfault. On my joint-stock estate every director and manager would feel\r\nthat all his colleagues were letting him down and destroying his\r\nprofits. It is hard to make people accept at all readily, in practice,\r\nthe teaching that they are their brothers' keeper.\r\n\r\nThe scheme could hardly be started with men accustomed to the present\r\nmethods, and the cost of obtaining vacant possession of land would make\r\nit difficult to try with new men. I am sure, however, that something of\r\nthe sort is a good and hopeful idea, and the best way of making the\r\nladder complete. And I am emboldened to think that something of the sort\r\nwill be tried gradually in some places, when I see the number of\r\nlandlords' sons who are in this and other universities taking the best\r\ncourses they can get in the science and economics of agriculture. They\r\nknow this is the only way to retain a remnant of the old acres. It is\r\nquite new since the war--and a most hopeful sign.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEPENDENCE\r\n\r\nI need not urge the importance in our villages of real independence of\r\nlife. It was the absence of independence combined with long working\r\nhours and little occupation for the hours of leisure, which, more than\r\nlow wages, caused the pre-war exodus from the country. Should the\r\nprospects of industry improve, but agriculture remain depressed, there\r\nwill be another exodus from the country-side of the best of the young\r\nmen who have come back to it after the war. It is of first-class\r\nimportance, both from the national and from the agricultural point of\r\nview, that they should stay, for there was a real danger before the war\r\nthat agriculture might become a residual industry, carried on mainly by\r\nthem, too lethargic in mind and body to do anything else.\r\n\r\nIn a preface which he wrote to Volume I of the Land Report, as chairman\r\nof Lloyd George's Land Inquiry Committee (it seems a long time ago now\r\nthat Lloyd George was a keen land reformer), my father sketched out the\r\nidea of setting up commissions to report parish by parish in each\r\ncounty, in the same way that commissions have reported on the parochial\r\ncharities. They would record how the land was distributed, whether the\r\ninfluence of the landowners told for freedom or against it, whether\r\nthere was a chance for the labourer to get on to the land and to mount\r\nthe ladder. Whether there was an efficient village institute, whether\r\nthere were enough allotments conveniently situated, whether the\r\ncottagers were allowed to keep pigs and poultry, and what the health and\r\nhousing were like.\r\n\r\nIt is a good idea, and should be borne in mind. I confess I do not know\r\nenough to know whether it is now as desirable as it seemed to be before\r\nthe war. I would fain hope not, but I am not sure. I believe that there\r\nis a good deal more real independent life in the villages now than there\r\nwas ten years ago. There are, I think, now fewer villages like some in\r\nNorth Yorkshire before the war, in which the only chance for a Liberal\r\ncandidate to have a meeting was to have it in the open-air, after dark\r\non a night with no moon, and even then he needed a big voice--for his\r\nimmediate audience was apt to be two dogs and a pig. Now, it seems to me\r\nthat people like having political meetings going on, but do not bother\r\nto listen to any of them.\r\n\r\nAs to the present, there has been lately, within my knowledge, a great\r\nbuilding of village institutes. There has been a tremendous development\r\nof football. Village industries, under the wise encouragement of the\r\nDevelopment Commission, are reviving. Motor buses make access to town\r\namusements much easier, and cinemas come out into the village. There is\r\nrevived interest and very keen competition in the allotment and cottage\r\ngarden shows. Thus it is, at any rate, down our way--but no one can know\r\nmore than his own bit of country. On these and similar matters we ought\r\nto think and watch and meet together to report and discuss. We need more\r\nMaurice Hewletts and Mrs. Sturge Grettons to tell us how things really\r\nare, for nothing is so difficult to visualise as what is going on slowly\r\nin one's own parish.\r\n\r\n\r\nCO-OPERATION\r\n\r\nI come lastly to co-operation. You will think me biased when I speak of\r\nits possibilities. I am. I have been for eighteen years on the governing\r\nbody of the Agricultural Organisation Society, and happen now to be its\r\nchairman, and am therefore closely in touch with the work of organising\r\nco-operative effort. One sees fairly clearly how difficult it is to make\r\nany class of English agriculturists combine for any mutual purpose, how\r\nworth while it is, and what almost unexpected opportunities of useful\r\nwork still exist. Thanks largely to untiring work by Sir Leslie\r\nScott--who gave up the chairmanship of the society on his recent\r\nappointment as Solicitor-General--the country is now fairly covered by\r\nsocieties for purchasing requirements co-operatively--principally\r\nfertilisers, feeding-stuffs, and seeds. There are also affiliated to the\r\nmovement I have mentioned, many useful co-operative auction marts,\r\nslaughter-house societies, bacon factories, wool societies, egg and\r\npoultry societies, and fruit and garden produce societies (but not\r\nnearly enough), besides a thousand or so societies of allotment holders\r\nwhich, thanks largely to our friend, George Nicholls, set all the others\r\nan example in keenness and loyalty to their parent body.\r\n\r\nThe _ideal_ is that where a society exists the main raw materials of the\r\nindustry shall be bought wholesale instead of retail, and the main\r\nproducts of the industry sold retail instead of wholesale; that thereby\r\nmiddlemen's and other profits shall be reduced to a reasonable figure,\r\nand that the consumer shall get the most efficient possible service with\r\nregard to his supplies. It is also the ideal that farmers and others\r\nshall learn more comradeship and brotherhood; that the big and small men\r\nalike shall become one community bound together for many common\r\npurposes, and that thus the cultivators of the soil shall lose that\r\nisolation and selfishness which is a reproach against them. The ideal\r\nis, however, not always realised. The farmer likes to have a\r\nco-operative society to keep down other people's prices, but, having\r\nhelped to form a society, he does not see why he should be loyal to it\r\nif a trader offers him anything a shilling a ton cheaper. A good\r\ncommittee is formed, but the members think they hold their offices\r\nmainly in order to get first cut for themselves at some good bargain the\r\nsociety has made, and they start with the delusion that they are good\r\nmen of business. Things, therefore, get into the hands of the manager,\r\nand it is astonishing how much more quickly a bad manager can lose money\r\nthan a good one can make it. And if in these and other ways it is uphill\r\nwork with farmers' societies, the work is still more uphill with\r\nsmall-holders. It is the breath of their nostrils to bargain\r\nindividually, and if a society is started they will only send their\r\nstuff to be sold when they and every one else have a glut, ungraded and\r\nbadly packed--and then they grumble at getting a low price.\r\n\r\nBut all co-operative work is abundantly worth while. And the field of\r\nco-operation is not limited to the purchase of supplies or the sale of\r\nproduce. It ought to cover the use of tractors and threshing sets and\r\nthe installation and distribution of power. And if agriculture gets a\r\nchance of settling down to a moderate amount of stability and\r\nprosperity, it would not be beyond the bounds of hope that part, at any\r\nrate, of the profits of co-operative enterprise should be used to\r\ndevelop the amenities of the common life of the community--to provide\r\nprizes for the sports and the flower show--the capital to start an\r\nindustry for the winter evenings, and even seats for the old people\r\nround the village green.\r\n\r\nTimes are not propitious for increasing the productivity of our land,\r\nexcepting by the slow processes of education--which work particularly\r\nslowly in agriculture. Nor are they immediately propitious for raising\r\nthe workers' standard of life, though we should never leave go of this\r\nas an essential. But many of us can, if we will, help a good man to\r\nstart on the land, or help a man who has made good on the land to do\r\nbetter. Many of us can help to develop real independence of life in the\r\nvillages and, through co-operation, those kindly virtues of friendliness\r\nand helpfulness to others and willingness to work for common ends which\r\nare sometimes not so common as they might be. And those who _can_ do any\r\nof these things _should_, without waiting for legislation--for the\r\nlegislator is a bruised reed.\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's Notes:\r\nThe following apparent printer's errors have been corrected for this\r\nelectronic edition:\r\n\r\nmisconduct necessitates military operations;\r\nwas \"operations:\"\r\n\r\nand if he tries to make his responsibility real\r\nwas \"responsiblity\"\r\n\r\nthings slide--the main virtue of Cabinet\r\nwas \"virture\"\r\n\r\nare two which are almost invariably present towards\r\nwas \"invarably\"]",
