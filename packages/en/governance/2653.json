On this point, the present rebellion\r\nbrought our republic to a severe test, and the Presidential election,\r\noccurring in regular course during the rebellion, added not a little\r\nto the strain.... The strife of the election is but human nature\r\npractically applied to the facts in the case. What has occurred in this\r\ncase must ever occur in similar cases. Human nature will not change. In\r\nany future great national trial, compared with the men of this, we shall\r\nhave as weak and as strong, as silly and as wise, as bad and as good.\r\nLet us therefore study the incidents in this as philosophy to learn\r\nwisdom from and none of them as wrongs to be avenged.... Now that the\r\nelection is over, may not all having a common interest reunite in a\r\ncommon fort to save our common country? For my own part, I have striven\r\nand shall strive to avoid placing any obstacle in the way. So long as I\r\nhave been here, I have not willingly planted a thorn in any man’s bosom.\r\nWhile I am deeply sensible to the high compliment of a re-election\r\nand duly grateful, as I trust, to Almighty God for having directed my\r\ncountrymen to a right conclusion, as I think for their own good, it adds\r\nnothing to my satisfaction that any other man may be disappointed or\r\npained by the result.”\r\n\r\nThis speech has not attracted much general attention, yet it is in a\r\npeculiar degree both illustrative and typical of the great statesman who\r\nmade it, alike in its strong common-sense and in its lofty standard of\r\nmorality. Lincoln’s life, Lincoln’s deeds and words, are not only of\r\nconsuming interest to the historian, but should be intimately known to\r\nevery man engaged in the hard practical work of American political life.\r\nIt is difficult to overstate how much it means to a nation to have as\r\nthe two foremost figures in its history men like Washington and Lincoln.\r\nIt is good for every man in any way concerned in public life to feel\r\nthat the highest ambition any American can possibly have will be\r\ngratified just in proportion as he raises himself toward the standards\r\nset by these two men.\r\n\r\nIt is a very poor thing, whether for nations or individuals, to advance\r\nthe history of great deeds done in the past as an excuse for doing\r\npoorly in the present; but it is an excellent thing to study the history\r\nof the great deeds of the past, and of the great men who did them, with\r\nan earnest desire to profit thereby so as to render better service in\r\nthe present. In their essentials, the men of the present day are much\r\nlike the men of the past, and the live issues of the present can be\r\nfaced to better advantage by men who have in good faith studied how the\r\nleaders of the nation faced the dead issues of the past. Such a study of\r\nLincoln’s life will enable us to avoid the twin gulfs of immorality and\r\ninefficiency—the gulfs which always lie one on each side of the careers\r\nalike of man and of nation. It helps nothing to have avoided one if\r\nshipwreck is encountered in the other. The fanatic, the well-meaning\r\nmoralist of unbalanced mind, the parlor critic who condemns others but\r\nhas no power himself to do good and but little power to do ill—all\r\nthese were as alien to Lincoln as the vicious and unpatriotic\r\nthemselves. His life teaches our people that they must act with wisdom,\r\nbecause otherwise adherence to right will be mere sound and fury without\r\nsubstance; and that they must also act high-mindedly, or else what seems\r\nto be wisdom will in the end turn out to be the most destructive kind of\r\nfolly.\r\n\r\nThroughout his entire life, and especially after he rose to leadership\r\nin his party, Lincoln was stirred to his depths by the sense of fealty\r\nto a lofty ideal; but throughout his entire life, he also accepted human\r\nnature as it is, and worked with keen, practical good sense to achieve\r\nresults with the instruments at hand. It is impossible to conceive of a\r\nman farther removed from baseness, farther removed from corruption, from\r\nmere self-seeking; but it is also impossible to conceive of a man of\r\nmore sane and healthy mind—a man less under the influence of that\r\nfantastic and diseased morality (so fantastic and diseased as to be in\r\nreality profoundly immoral) which makes a man in this work-a-day\r\nworld refuse to do what is possible because he cannot accomplish the\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nIn the fifth volume of Lecky’s History of England, the historian draws\r\nan interesting distinction between the qualities needed for a successful\r\npolitical career in modern society and those which lead to eminence in\r\nthe spheres of pure intellect or pure moral effort. He says:\r\n\r\n“....the moral qualities that are required in the higher spheres\r\nof statesmanship [are not] those of a hero or a saint. Passionate\r\nearnestness and self-devotion, complete concentration of every faculty\r\non an unselfish aim, uncalculating daring, a delicacy of conscience and\r\na loftiness of aim far exceeding those of the average of men, are here\r\nlikely to prove rather a hindrance than an assistance. The politician\r\ndeals very largely with the superficial and the commonplace; his art is\r\nin a great measure that of skilful compromise, and in the conditions\r\nof modern life, the statesman is likely to succeed best who possesses\r\nsecondary qualities to an unusual degree, who is in the closest\r\nintellectual and moral sympathy with the average of the intelligent\r\nmen of his time, and who pursues common ideals with more than common\r\nability.... Tact, business talent, knowledge of men, resolution,\r\npromptitude and sagacity in dealing with immediate emergencies, a\r\ncharacter which lends itself easily to conciliation, diminishes friction\r\nand inspires confidence, are especially needed, and they are more likely\r\nto be found among shrewd and enlightened men of the world than among men\r\nof great original genius or of an heroic type of character.”\r\n\r\nThe American people should feel profoundly grateful that the greatest\r\nAmerican statesman since Washington, the statesman who in this\r\nabsolutely democratic republic succeeded best, was the very man who\r\nactually combined the two sets of qualities which the historian thus\r\nputs in antithesis. Abraham Lincoln, the rail-splitter, the Western\r\ncountry lawyer, was one of the shrewdest and most enlightened men of the\r\nworld, and he had all the practical qualities which enable such a man to\r\nguide his countrymen; and yet he was also a genius of the heroic type,\r\na leader who rose level to the greatest crisis through which this nation\r\nor any other nation had to pass in the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nTHEODORE ROOSEVELT\r\n\r\nSAGAMORE HILL, OYSTER BAY, N. Y., September 22, 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\r\n\r\n\r\n“I have endured,” wrote Lincoln not long before his death, “a great\r\ndeal of ridicule without much malice, and have received a great deal of\r\nkindness not quite free from ridicule.” On Easter Day, 1865, the world\r\nknew how little this ridicule, how much this kindness, had really\r\nsignified. Thereafter, Lincoln the man became Lincoln the hero, year by\r\nyear more heroic, until to-day, with the swift passing of those who knew\r\nhim, his figure grows ever dimmer, less real. This should not be. For\r\nLincoln the man, patient, wise, set in a high resolve, is worth far more\r\nthan Lincoln the hero, vaguely glorious. Invaluable is the example of\r\nthe man, intangible that of the hero.\r\n\r\nAnd, though it is not for us, as for those who in awed stillness\r\nlistened at Gettysburg with inspired perception, to know Abraham\r\nLincoln, yet there is for us another way whereby we may attain such\r\nknowledge—through his words—uttered in all sincerity to those who\r\nloved or hated him. Cold, unsatisfying they may seem, these printed\r\nwords, while we can yet speak with those who knew him, and look into\r\neyes that once looked into his. But in truth it is here that we find his\r\nsimple greatness, his great simplicity, and though no man tried less so\r\nto show his power, no man has so shown it more clearly.\r\n\r\nThus these writings of Abraham Lincoln are associated with those of\r\nWashington, Hamilton, Franklin, and of the other “Founders of the\r\nRepublic,” not that Lincoln should become still more of the past, but,\r\nrather, that he with them should become still more of the present.\r\nHowever faint and mythical may grow the story of that Great Struggle,\r\nthe leader, Lincoln, at least should remain a real, living American.\r\nNo matter how clearly, how directly, Lincoln has shown himself in his\r\nwritings, we yet should not forget those men whose minds, from their\r\nvarious view-points, have illumined for us his character. As this nation\r\nowes a great debt to Lincoln, so, also, Lincoln’s memory owes a great\r\ndebt to a nation which, as no other nation could have done, has been\r\nable to appreciate his full worth. Among the many who have brought about\r\nthis appreciation, those only whose estimates have been placed in these\r\nvolumes may be mentioned here. To President Roosevelt, to Mr. Schurz\r\nand to Mr. Choate, the editor, for himself, for the publishers, and on\r\nbehalf of the readers, wishes to offer his sincere acknowledgments.\r\n\r\nThanks are also due, for valuable and sympathetic assistance rendered in\r\nthe preparation of this work, to Mr. Gilbert A. Tracy, of Putnam, Conn.,\r\nMajor William H. Lambert, of Philadelphia, and Mr. C. F. Gunther, of\r\nChicago, to the Chicago Historical Association and personally to\r\nits capable Secretary, Miss McIlvaine, to Major Henry S. Burrage, of\r\nPortland, Me., and to General Thomas J. Henderson, of Illinois.\r\n\r\nFor various courtesies received, the editor is furthermore indebted to\r\nthe Librarian of the Library of Congress; to Messrs. McClure, Phillips\r\n& Co., D. Appleton & Co., Macmillan & Co., Dodd, Mead & Co., and Harper\r\nBrothers, of New York; to Houghton, Mifflin & Co., Dana, Estes & Co.,\r\nand L. C. Page & Co., of Boston; to A. C. McClure & Co., of Chicago; to\r\nThe Robert Clarke Co., of Cincinnati, and to the J. B. Lippincott Co.,\r\nof Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to add that every effort has been made by the\r\neditor to bring into these volumes whatever material may there properly\r\nbelong, material much of which is widely scattered in public libraries\r\nand in private collections. He has been fortunate in securing certain\r\ninteresting correspondence and papers which had not before come into\r\nprint in book form. Information concerning some of these papers had\r\nreached him too late to enable the papers to find place in their proper\r\nchronological order in the set. Rather, however, than not to present\r\nthese papers to the readers they have been included in the seventh\r\nvolume of the set, which concludes the “Writings.”\r\n\r\n   [These later papers are, in this etext, re-arranged into chronologic\r\n    order.

L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN: AN ESSAY BY CARL SHURZ\r\n\r\n\r\nNo American can study the character and career of Abraham Lincoln\r\nwithout being carried away by sentimental emotions. We are always\r\ninclined to idealize that which we love,—a state of mind very\r\nunfavorable to the exercise of sober critical judgment. It is therefore\r\nnot surprising that most of those who have written or spoken on that\r\nextraordinary man, even while conscientiously endeavoring to draw a\r\nlifelike portraiture of his being, and to form a just estimate of his\r\npublic conduct, should have drifted into more or less indiscriminating\r\neulogy, painting his great features in the most glowing colors, and\r\ncovering with tender shadings whatever might look like a blemish.\r\n\r\nBut his standing before posterity will not be exalted by mere praise of\r\nhis virtues and abilities, nor by any concealment of his limitations\r\nand faults. The stature of the great man, one of whose peculiar charms\r\nconsisted in his being so unlike all other great men, will rather lose\r\nthan gain by the idealization which so easily runs into the commonplace.\r\nFor it was distinctly the weird mixture of qualities and forces in him,\r\nof the lofty with the common, the ideal with the uncouth, of that which\r\nhe had become with that which he had not ceased to be, that made him\r\nso fascinating a character among his fellow-men, gave him his singular\r\npower over their minds and hearts, and fitted him to be the greatest\r\nleader in the greatest crisis of our national life.\r\n\r\nHis was indeed a marvellous growth. The statesman or the military hero\r\nborn and reared in a log cabin is a familiar figure in American history;\r\nbut we may search in vain among our celebrities for one whose origin and\r\nearly life equalled Abraham Lincoln’s in wretchedness. He first saw the\r\nlight in a miserable hovel in Kentucky, on a farm consisting of a\r\nfew barren acres in a dreary neighborhood; his father a typical “poor\r\nSouthern white,” shiftless and without ambition for himself or his\r\nchildren, constantly looking for a new piece of land on which he might\r\nmake a living without much work; his mother, in her youth handsome and\r\nbright, grown prematurely coarse in feature and soured in mind by daily\r\ntoil and care; the whole household squalid, cheerless, and utterly void\r\nof elevating inspirations.... Only when the family had “moved” into the\r\nmalarious backwoods of Indiana, the mother had died, and a stepmother,\r\na woman of thrift and energy, had taken charge of the children, the\r\nshaggy-headed, ragged, barefooted, forlorn boy, then seven years old,\r\n“began to feel like a human being.” Hard work was his early lot. When a\r\nmere boy he had to help in supporting the family, either on his father’s\r\nclearing, or hired out to other farmers to plough, or dig ditches, or\r\nchop wood, or drive ox teams; occasionally also to “tend the baby,”\r\nwhen the farmer’s wife was otherwise engaged. He could regard it as an\r\nadvancement to a higher sphere of activity when he obtained work in a\r\n“crossroads store,” where he amused the customers by his talk over the\r\ncounter; for he soon distinguished himself among the backwoods folk\r\nas one who had something to say worth listening to. To win that\r\ndistinction, he had to draw mainly upon his wits; for, while his thirst\r\nfor knowledge was great, his opportunities for satisfying that thirst\r\nwere wofully slender.\r\n\r\nIn the log schoolhouse, which he could visit but little, he was taught\r\nonly reading, writing, and elementary arithmetic. Among the people\r\nof the settlement, bush farmers and small tradesmen, he found none of\r\nuncommon intelligence or education; but some of them had a few books,\r\nwhich he borrowed eagerly. Thus he read and reread, AEsop’s Fables,\r\nlearning to tell stories with a point and to argue by parables; he read\r\nRobinson Crusoe, The Pilgrim’s Progress, a short history of the United\r\nStates, and Weems’s Life of Washington. To the town constable’s he went\r\nto read the Revised Statutes of Indiana. Every printed page that fell\r\ninto his hands he would greedily devour, and his family and friends\r\nwatched him with wonder, as the uncouth boy, after his daily work,\r\ncrouched in a corner of the log cabin or outside under a tree, absorbed\r\nin a book while munching his supper of corn bread. In this manner he\r\nbegan to gather some knowledge, and sometimes he would astonish the\r\ngirls with such startling remarks as that the earth was moving around\r\nthe sun, and not the sun around the earth, and they marvelled where\r\n“Abe” could have got such queer notions. Soon he also felt the impulse\r\nto write; not only making extracts from books he wished to remember, but\r\nalso composing little essays of his own. First he sketched these with\r\ncharcoal on a wooden shovel scraped white with a drawing-knife, or on\r\nbasswood shingles. Then he transferred them to paper, which was a scarce\r\ncommodity in the Lincoln household; taking care to cut his expressions\r\nclose, so that they might not cover too much space,—a style-forming\r\nmethod greatly to be commended. Seeing boys put a burning coal on the\r\nback of a wood turtle, he was moved to write on cruelty to animals.\r\nSeeing men intoxicated with whiskey, he wrote on temperance. In\r\nverse-making, too, he tried himself, and in satire on persons offensive\r\nto him or others,—satire the rustic wit of which was not always fit for\r\nears polite. Also political thoughts he put upon paper, and some of\r\nhis pieces were even deemed good enough for publication in the county\r\nweekly.\r\n\r\nThus he won a neighborhood reputation as a clever young man, which he\r\nincreased by his performances as a speaker, not seldom drawing upon\r\nhimself the dissatisfaction of his employers by mounting a stump in the\r\nfield, and keeping the farm hands from their work by little speeches in\r\na jocose and sometimes also a serious vein. At the rude social frolics\r\nof the settlement he became an important person, telling funny, stories,\r\nmimicking the itinerant preachers who had happened to pass by, and\r\nmaking his mark at wrestling matches, too; for at the age of seventeen\r\nhe had attained his full height, six feet four inches in his stockings,\r\nif he had any, and a terribly muscular clodhopper he was. But he\r\nwas known never to use his extraordinary strength to the injury or\r\nhumiliation of others; rather to do them a kindly turn, or to enforce\r\njustice and fair dealing between them. All this made him a favorite in\r\nbackwoods society, although in some things he appeared a little odd,\r\nto his friends. Far more than any of them, he was given not only to\r\nreading, but to fits of abstraction, to quiet musing with himself, and\r\nalso to strange spells of melancholy, from which he often would pass in\r\na moment to rollicking outbursts of droll humor. But on the whole he\r\nwas one of the people among whom he lived; in appearance perhaps even\r\na little more uncouth than most of them,—a very tall, rawboned youth,\r\nwith large features, dark, shrivelled skin, and rebellious hair; his\r\narms and legs long, out of proportion; clad in deerskin trousers, which\r\nfrom frequent exposure to the rain had shrunk so as to sit tightly on\r\nhis limbs, leaving several inches of bluish shin exposed between their\r\nlower end and the heavy tan-colored shoes; the nether garment held\r\nusually by only one suspender, that was strung over a coarse homemade\r\nshirt; the head covered in winter with a coonskin cap, in summer with a\r\nrough straw hat of uncertain shape, without a band.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether he felt himself much superior to his\r\nsurroundings, although he confessed to a yearning for some knowledge\r\nof the world outside of the circle in which he lived. This wish was\r\ngratified; but how? At the age of nineteen he went down the Mississippi\r\nto New Orleans as a flatboat hand, temporarily joining a trade many\r\nmembers of which at that time still took pride in being called “half\r\nhorse and half alligator.” After his return he worked and lived in the\r\nold way until the spring of 1830, when his father “moved again,” this\r\ntime to Illinois; and on the journey of fifteen days “Abe” had to drive\r\nthe ox wagon which carried the household goods. Another log cabin was\r\nbuilt, and then, fencing a field, Abraham Lincoln split those historic\r\nrails which were destined to play so picturesque a part in the\r\nPresidential campaign twenty-eight years later.\r\n\r\nHaving come of age, Lincoln left the family, and “struck out for\r\nhimself.” He had to “take jobs whenever he could get them.” The first\r\nof these carried him again as a flatboat hand to New Orleans. There\r\nsomething happened that made a lasting impression upon his soul:\r\nhe witnessed a slave auction. “His heart bled,” wrote one of his\r\ncompanions; “said nothing much; was silent; looked bad. I can say,\r\nknowing it, that it was on this trip that he formed his opinion on\r\nslavery. It run its iron in him then and there, May, 1831. I have\r\nheard him say so often.” Then he lived several years at New Salem,\r\nin Illinois, a small mushroom village, with a mill, some “stores” and\r\nwhiskey shops, that rose quickly, and soon disappeared again. It was a\r\ndesolate, disjointed, half-working and half-loitering life, without any\r\nother aim than to gain food and shelter from day to day. He served as\r\npilot on a steamboat trip, then as clerk in a store and a mill; business\r\nfailing, he was adrift for some time. Being compelled to measure his\r\nstrength with the chief bully of the neighborhood, and overcoming him,\r\nhe became a noted person in that muscular community, and won the esteem\r\nand friendship of the ruling gang of ruffians to such a degree that,\r\nwhen the Black Hawk war broke out, they elected him, a young man of\r\ntwenty-three, captain of a volunteer company, composed mainly of roughs\r\nof their kind. He took the field, and his most noteworthy deed of valor\r\nconsisted, not in killing an Indian, but in protecting against his own\r\nmen, at the peril of his own life, the life of an old savage who had\r\nstrayed into his camp.\r\n\r\nThe Black Hawk war over, he turned to politics. The step from the\r\ncaptaincy of a volunteer company to a candidacy for a seat in the\r\nLegislature seemed a natural one. But his popularity, although great\r\nin New Salem, had not spread far enough over the district, and he was\r\ndefeated. Then the wretched hand-to-mouth struggle began again. He “set\r\nup in store-business” with a dissolute partner, who drank whiskey while\r\nLincoln was reading books. The result was a disastrous failure and a\r\nload of debt. Thereupon he became a deputy surveyor, and was appointed\r\npostmaster of New Salem, the business of the post-office being so small\r\nthat he could carry the incoming and outgoing mail in his hat. All this\r\ncould not lift him from poverty, and his surveying instruments and horse\r\nand saddle were sold by the sheriff for debt.\r\n\r\nBut while all this misery was upon him his ambition rose to higher aims.\r\nHe walked many miles to borrow from a schoolmaster a grammar with which\r\nto improve his language. A lawyer lent him a copy of Blackstone, and he\r\nbegan to study law.\r\n\r\nPeople would look wonderingly at the grotesque figure lying in the\r\ngrass, “with his feet up a tree,” or sitting on a fence, as, absorbed\r\nin a book, he learned to construct correct sentences and made himself\r\na jurist. At once he gained a little practice, pettifogging before a\r\njustice of the peace for friends, without expecting a fee. Judicial\r\nfunctions, too, were thrust upon him, but only at horse-races or\r\nwrestling matches, where his acknowledged honesty and fairness gave his\r\nverdicts undisputed authority. His popularity grew apace, and soon\r\nhe could be a candidate for the Legislature again. Although he called\r\nhimself a Whig, an ardent admirer of Henry Clay, his clever stump\r\nspeeches won him the election in the strongly Democratic district.\r\nThen for the first time, perhaps, he thought seriously of his outward\r\nappearance. So far he had been content with a garb of “Kentucky jeans,”\r\nnot seldom ragged, usually patched, and always shabby. Now, he borrowed\r\nsome money from a friend to buy a new suit of clothes—“store clothes”\r\nfit for a Sangamon County statesman; and thus adorned he set out for the\r\nstate capital, Vandalia, to take his seat among the lawmakers.\r\n\r\nHis legislative career, which stretched over several sessions—for\r\nhe was thrice re-elected, in 1836, 1838, and 1840—was not remarkably\r\nbrilliant. He did, indeed, not lack ambition. He dreamed even of making\r\nhimself “the De Witt Clinton of Illinois,” and he actually distinguished\r\nhimself by zealous and effective work in those “log-rolling” operations\r\nby which the young State received “a general system of internal\r\nimprovements” in the shape of railroads, canals, and banks,—a reckless\r\npolicy, burdening the State with debt, and producing the usual crop of\r\npolitical demoralization, but a policy characteristic of the time and\r\nthe impatiently enterprising spirit of the Western people. Lincoln,\r\nno doubt with the best intentions, but with little knowledge of the\r\nsubject, simply followed the popular current. The achievement in which,\r\nperhaps, he gloried most was the removal of the State government from\r\nVandalia to Springfield; one of those triumphs of political management\r\nwhich are apt to be the pride of the small politician’s statesmanship.\r\nOne thing, however, he did in which his true nature asserted itself, and\r\nwhich gave distinct promise of the future pursuit of high aims. Against\r\nan overwhelming preponderance of sentiment in the Legislature, followed\r\nby only one other member, he recorded his protest against a proslavery\r\nresolution,—that protest declaring “the institution of slavery to\r\nbe founded on both injustice and bad policy.” This was not only the\r\nirrepressible voice of his conscience; it was true moral valor, too; for\r\nat that time, in many parts of the West, an abolitionist was regarded\r\nas little better than a horse-thief, and even “Abe Lincoln” would hardly\r\nhave been forgiven his antislavery principles, had he not been known\r\nas such an “uncommon good fellow.” But here, in obedience to the great\r\nconviction of his life, he manifested his courage to stand alone, that\r\ncourage which is the first requisite of leadership in a great cause.\r\n\r\nTogether with his reputation and influence as a politician grew his law\r\npractice, especially after he had removed from New Salem to Springfield,\r\nand associated himself with a practitioner of good standing. He had now\r\nat last won a fixed position in society. He became a successful lawyer,\r\nless, indeed, by his learning as a jurist than by his effectiveness as\r\nan advocate and by the striking uprightness of his character; and it may\r\ntruly be said that his vivid sense of truth and justice had much to do\r\nwith his effectiveness as an advocate. He would refuse to act as the\r\nattorney even of personal friends when he saw the right on the other\r\nside. He would abandon cases, even during trial, when the testimony\r\nconvinced him that his client was in the wrong. He would dissuade those\r\nwho sought his service from pursuing an obtainable advantage when their\r\nclaims seemed to him unfair. Presenting his very first case in the\r\nUnited States Circuit Court, the only question being one of authority,\r\nhe declared that, upon careful examination, he found all the authorities\r\non the other side, and none on his. Persons accused of crime, when he\r\nthought them guilty, he would not defend at all, or, attempting their\r\ndefence, he was unable to put forth his powers. One notable exception is\r\non record, when his personal sympathies had been strongly aroused. But\r\nwhen he felt himself to be the protector of innocence, the defender\r\nof justice, or the prosecutor of wrong, he frequently disclosed such\r\nunexpected resources of reasoning, such depth of feeling, and rose to\r\nsuch fervor of appeal as to astonish and overwhelm his hearers, and make\r\nhim fairly irresistible. Even an ordinary law argument, coming from him,\r\nseldom failed to produce the impression that he was profoundly convinced\r\nof the soundness of his position. It is not surprising that the mere\r\nappearance of so conscientious an attorney in any case should have\r\ncarried, not only to juries, but even to judges, almost a presumption\r\nof right on his side, and that the people began to call him, sincerely\r\nmeaning it, “honest Abe Lincoln.”\r\n\r\nIn the meantime he had private sorrows and trials of a painfully\r\nafflicting nature. He had loved and been loved by a fair and estimable\r\ngirl, Ann Rutledge, who died in the flower of her youth and beauty, and\r\nhe mourned her loss with such intensity of grief that his friends feared\r\nfor his reason. Recovering from his morbid depression, he bestowed\r\nwhat he thought a new affection upon another lady, who refused him.\r\nAnd finally, moderately prosperous in his worldly affairs, and having\r\nprospects of political distinction before him, he paid his addresses to\r\nMary Todd, of Kentucky, and was accepted. But then tormenting doubts of\r\nthe genuineness of his own affection for her, of the compatibility\r\nof their characters, and of their future happiness came upon him. His\r\ndistress was so great that he felt himself in danger of suicide, and\r\nfeared to carry a pocket-knife with him; and he gave mortal offence\r\nto his bride by not appearing on the appointed wedding day. Now the\r\ntorturing consciousness of the wrong he had done her grew unendurable.\r\nHe won back her affection, ended the agony by marrying her, and became a\r\nfaithful and patient husband and a good father. But it was no secret\r\nto those who knew the family well that his domestic life was full of\r\ntrials. The erratic temper of his wife not seldom put the gentleness\r\nof his nature to the severest tests; and these troubles and struggles,\r\nwhich accompanied him through all the vicissitudes of his life from\r\nthe modest home in Springfield to the White House at Washington,\r\nadding untold private heart-burnings to his public cares, and sometimes\r\nprecipitating upon him incredible embarrassments in the discharge of his\r\npublic duties, form one of the most pathetic features of his career.\r\n\r\nHe continued to “ride the circuit,” read books while travelling in his\r\nbuggy, told funny stories to his fellow-lawyers in the tavern, chatted\r\nfamiliarly with his neighbors around the stove in the store and at the\r\npost-office, had his hours of melancholy brooding as of old, and became\r\nmore and more widely known and trusted and beloved among the people\r\nof his State for his ability as a lawyer and politician, for the\r\nuprightness of his character and the overflowing spring of sympathetic\r\nkindness in his heart. His main ambition was confessedly that of\r\npolitical distinction; but hardly any one would at that time have seen\r\nin him the man destined to lead the nation through the greatest crisis\r\nof the century.\r\n\r\nHis time had not yet come when, in 1846, he was elected to Congress. In\r\na clever speech in the House of Representatives he denounced President\r\nPolk for having unjustly forced war upon Mexico, and he amused the\r\nCommittee of the Whole by a witty attack upon General Cass. More\r\nimportant was the expression he gave to his antislavery impulses\r\nby offering a bill looking to the emancipation of the slaves in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, and by his repeated votes for the famous Wilmot\r\nProviso, intended to exclude slavery from the Territories acquired from\r\nMexico. But when, at the expiration of his term, in March, 1849, he left\r\nhis seat, he gloomily despaired of ever seeing the day when the cause\r\nnearest to his heart would be rightly grasped by the people, and when he\r\nwould be able to render any service to his country in solving the great\r\nproblem. Nor had his career as a member of Congress in any sense been\r\nsuch as to gratify his ambition. Indeed, if he ever had any belief in a\r\ngreat destiny for himself, it must have been weak at that period; for he\r\nactually sought to obtain from the new Whig President, General Taylor,\r\nthe place of Commissioner of the General Land Office; willing to\r\nbury himself in one of the administrative bureaus of the government.\r\nFortunately for the country, he failed; and no less fortunately, when,\r\nlater, the territorial governorship of Oregon was offered to him, Mrs.\r\nLincoln’s protest induced him to decline it. Returning to Springfield,\r\nhe gave himself with renewed zest to his law practice, acquiesced in the\r\nCompromise of 1850 with reluctance and a mental reservation, supported\r\nin the Presidential campaign of 1852 the Whig candidate in some\r\nspiritless speeches, and took but a languid interest in the politics of\r\nthe day. But just then his time was drawing near.\r\n\r\nThe peace promised, and apparently inaugurated, by the Compromise of\r\n1850 was rudely broken by the introduction of the Kansas-Nebraska Bill\r\nin 1854. The repeal of the Missouri Compromise, opening the Territories\r\nof the United States, the heritage of coming generations, to the\r\ninvasion of slavery, suddenly revealed the whole significance of the\r\nslavery question to the people of the free States, and thrust itself\r\ninto the politics of the country as the paramount issue. Something like\r\nan electric shock flashed through the North. Men who but a short time\r\nbefore had been absorbed by their business pursuits, and deprecated all\r\npolitical agitation, were startled out of their security by a sudden\r\nalarm, and excitedly took sides. That restless trouble of conscience\r\nabout slavery, which even in times of apparent repose had secretly\r\ndisturbed the souls of Northern people, broke forth in an utterance\r\nlouder than ever. The bonds of accustomed party allegiance gave way.\r\nAntislavery Democrats and antislavery Whigs felt themselves drawn\r\ntogether by a common overpowering sentiment, and soon they began to\r\nrally in a new organization. The Republican party sprang into being to\r\nmeet the overruling call of the hour. Then Abraham Lincoln’s time was\r\ncome. He rapidly advanced to a position of conspicuous championship in\r\nthe struggle. This, however, was not owing to his virtues and abilities\r\nalone. Indeed, the slavery question stirred his soul in its profoundest\r\ndepths; it was, as one of his intimate friends said, “the only one on\r\nwhich he would become excited”; it called forth all his faculties and\r\nenergies. Yet there were many others who, having long and arduously\r\nfought the antislavery battle in the popular assembly, or in the press,\r\nor in the halls of Congress, far surpassed him in prestige, and compared\r\nwith whom he was still an obscure and untried man. His reputation,\r\nalthough highly honorable and well earned, had so far been essentially\r\nlocal. As a stump-speaker in Whig canvasses outside of his State he had\r\nattracted comparatively little attention; but in Illinois he had been\r\nrecognized as one of the foremost men of the Whig party. Among the\r\nopponents of the Nebraska Bill he occupied in his State so important\r\na position, that in 1856 he was the choice of a large majority of the\r\n“Anti-Nebraska men” in the Legislature for a seat in the Senate of the\r\nUnited States which then became vacant; and when he, an old Whig, could\r\nnot obtain the votes of the Anti-Nebraska Democrats necessary to make\r\na majority, he generously urged his friends to transfer their votes\r\nto Lyman Trumbull, who was then elected. Two years later, in the\r\nfirst national convention of the Republican party, the delegation from\r\nIllinois brought him forward as a candidate for the vice-presidency, and\r\nhe received respectable support. Still, the name of Abraham Lincoln was\r\nnot widely known beyond the boundaries of his own State. But now it was\r\nthis local prominence in Illinois that put him in a position of peculiar\r\nadvantage on the battlefield of national politics. In the assault on the\r\nMissouri Compromise which broke down all legal barriers to the spread\r\nof slavery Stephen Arnold Douglas was the ostensible leader and central\r\nfigure; and Douglas was a Senator from Illinois, Lincoln’s State.\r\nDouglas’s national theatre of action was the Senate, but in his\r\nconstituency in Illinois were the roots of his official position and\r\npower. What he did in the Senate he had to justify before the people\r\nof Illinois, in order to maintain himself in place; and in Illinois all\r\neyes turned to Lincoln as Douglas’s natural antagonist.\r\n\r\nAs very young men they had come to Illinois, Lincoln from Indiana,\r\nDouglas from Vermont, and had grown up together in public life, Douglas\r\nas a Democrat, Lincoln as a Whig. They had met first in Vandalia, in\r\n1834, when Lincoln was in the Legislature and Douglas in the lobby; and\r\nagain in 1836, both as members of the Legislature. Douglas, a very able\r\npolitician, of the agile, combative, audacious, “pushing” sort, rose in\r\npolitical distinction with remarkable rapidity. In quick succession he\r\nbecame a member of the Legislature, a State’s attorney, secretary\r\nof state, a judge on the supreme bench of Illinois, three times a\r\nRepresentative in Congress, and a Senator of the United States when only\r\nthirty-nine years old. In the National Democratic convention of 1852 he\r\nappeared even as an aspirant to the nomination for the Presidency, as\r\nthe favorite of “young America,” and received a respectable vote. He had\r\nfar outstripped Lincoln in what is commonly called political success\r\nand in reputation. But it had frequently happened that in political\r\ncampaigns Lincoln felt himself impelled, or was selected by his Whig\r\nfriends, to answer Douglas’s speeches; and thus the two were looked\r\nupon, in a large part of the State at least, as the representative\r\ncombatants of their respective parties in the debates before\r\npopular meetings. As soon, therefore, as, after the passage of his\r\nKansas-Nebraska Bill, Douglas returned to Illinois to defend his cause\r\nbefore his constituents, Lincoln, obeying not only his own impulse, but\r\nalso general expectation, stepped forward as his principal opponent.\r\nThus the struggle about the principles involved in the Kansas-Nebraska\r\nBill, or, in a broader sense, the struggle between freedom and slavery,\r\nassumed in Illinois the outward form of a personal contest between\r\nLincoln and Douglas; and, as it continued and became more animated,\r\nthat personal contest in Illinois was watched with constantly increasing\r\ninterest by the whole country. When, in 1858, Douglas’s senatorial term\r\nbeing about to expire, Lincoln was formally designated by the Republican\r\nconvention of Illinois as their candidate for the Senate, to take\r\nDouglas’s place, and the two contestants agreed to debate the questions\r\nat issue face to face in a series of public meetings, the eyes of the\r\nwhole American people were turned eagerly to that one point: and the\r\nspectacle reminded one of those lays of ancient times telling of two\r\narmies, in battle array, standing still to see their two principal\r\nchampions fight out the contested cause between the lines in single\r\ncombat.\r\n\r\nLincoln had then reached the full maturity of his powers. His equipment\r\nas a statesman did not embrace a comprehensive knowledge of public\r\naffairs. What he had studied he had indeed made his own, with the eager\r\ncraving and that zealous tenacity characteristic of superior minds\r\nlearning under difficulties. But his narrow opportunities and the\r\nunsteady life he had led during his younger years had not permitted\r\nthe accumulation of large stores in his mind. It is true, in political\r\ncampaigns he had occasionally spoken on the ostensible issues between\r\nthe Whigs and the Democrats, the tariff, internal improvements, banks,\r\nand so on, but only in a perfunctory manner. Had he ever given much\r\nserious thought and study to these subjects, it is safe to assume that\r\na mind so prolific of original conceits as his would certainly have\r\nproduced some utterance upon them worth remembering. His soul had\r\nevidently never been deeply stirred by such topics. But when his moral\r\nnature was aroused, his brain developed an untiring activity until it\r\nhad mastered all the knowledge within reach. As soon as the repeal of\r\nthe Missouri Compromise had thrust the slavery question into politics\r\nas the paramount issue, Lincoln plunged into an arduous study of all\r\nits legal, historical, and moral aspects, and then his mind became a\r\ncomplete arsenal of argument. His rich natural gifts, trained by long\r\nand varied practice, had made him an orator of rare persuasiveness. In\r\nhis immature days, he had pleased himself for a short period with that\r\ninflated, high-flown style which, among the uncultivated, passes for\r\n“beautiful speaking.” His inborn truthfulness and his artistic instinct\r\nsoon overcame that aberration and revealed to him the noble beauty and\r\nstrength of simplicity. He possessed an uncommon power of clear and\r\ncompact statement, which might have reminded those who knew the story\r\nof his early youth of the efforts of the poor boy, when he copied his\r\ncompositions from the scraped wooden shovel, carefully to trim his\r\nexpressions in order to save paper. His language had the energy of\r\nhonest directness and he was a master of logical lucidity. He loved\r\nto point and enliven his reasoning by humorous illustrations, usually\r\nanecdotes of Western life, of which he had an inexhaustible store at his\r\ncommand. These anecdotes had not seldom a flavor of rustic robustness\r\nabout them, but he used them with great effect, while amusing the\r\naudience, to give life to an abstraction, to explode an absurdity, to\r\nclinch an argument, to drive home an admonition. The natural kindliness\r\nof his tone, softening prejudice and disarming partisan rancor, would\r\noften open to his reasoning a way into minds most unwilling to receive\r\nit.\r\n\r\nYet his greatest power consisted in the charm of his individuality. That\r\ncharm did not, in the ordinary way, appeal to the ear or to the eye. His\r\nvoice was not melodious; rather shrill and piercing, especially when it\r\nrose to its high treble in moments of great animation. His figure was\r\nunhandsome, and the action of his unwieldy limbs awkward. He commanded\r\nnone of the outward graces of oratory as they are commonly understood.\r\nHis charm was of a different kind. It flowed from the rare depth and\r\ngenuineness of his convictions and his sympathetic feelings. Sympathy\r\nwas the strongest element in his nature. One of his biographers, who\r\nknew him before he became President, says: “Lincoln’s compassion might\r\nbe stirred deeply by an object present, but never by an object absent\r\nand unseen. In the former case he would most likely extend relief, with\r\nlittle inquiry into the merits of the case, because, as he expressed it\r\nhimself, it ‘took a pain out of his own heart.’” Only half of this is\r\ncorrect. It is certainly true that he could not witness any individual\r\ndistress or oppression, or any kind of suffering, without feeling a pang\r\nof pain himself, and that by relieving as much as he could the suffering\r\nof others he put an end to his own. This compassionate impulse to help\r\nhe felt not only for human beings, but for every living creature. As in\r\nhis boyhood he angrily reproved the boys who tormented a wood turtle by\r\nputting a burning coal on its back, so, we are told, he would, when a\r\nmature man, on a journey, dismount from his buggy and wade waist-deep\r\nin mire to rescue a pig struggling in a swamp. Indeed, appeals to his\r\ncompassion were so irresistible to him, and he felt it so difficult\r\nto refuse anything when his refusal could give pain, that he himself\r\nsometimes spoke of his inability to say “no” as a positive weakness.\r\nBut that certainly does not prove that his compassionate feeling was\r\nconfined to individual cases of suffering witnessed with his own eyes.\r\nAs the boy was moved by the aspect of the tortured wood turtle to\r\ncompose an essay against cruelty to animals in general, so the aspect of\r\nother cases of suffering and wrong wrought up his moral nature, and set\r\nhis mind to work against cruelty, injustice, and oppression in general.\r\n\r\nAs his sympathy went forth to others, it attracted others to him.\r\nEspecially those whom he called the “plain people” felt themselves drawn\r\nto him by the instinctive feeling that he understood, esteemed, and\r\nappreciated them. He had grown up among the poor, the lowly, the\r\nignorant. He never ceased to remember the good souls he had met among\r\nthem, and the many kindnesses they had done him. Although in his mental\r\ndevelopment he had risen far above them, he never looked down upon them.\r\nHow they felt and how they reasoned he knew, for so he had once felt and\r\nreasoned himself. How they could be moved he knew, for so he had once\r\nbeen moved himself and practised moving others. His mind was much larger\r\nthan theirs, but it thoroughly comprehended theirs; and while he thought\r\nmuch farther than they, their thoughts were ever present to him. Nor had\r\nthe visible distance between them grown as wide as his rise in the world\r\nwould seem to have warranted. Much of his backwoods speech and manners\r\nstill clung to him. Although he had become “Mr. Lincoln” to his later\r\nacquaintances, he was still “Abe” to the “Nats” and “Billys” and “Daves”\r\nof his youth; and their familiarity neither appeared unnatural to\r\nthem, nor was it in the least awkward to him. He still told and\r\nenjoyed stories similar to those he had told and enjoyed in the Indiana\r\nsettlement and at New Salem. His wants remained as modest as they had\r\never been; his domestic habits had by no means completely accommodated\r\nthemselves to those of his more highborn wife; and though the “Kentucky\r\njeans” apparel had long been dropped, his clothes of better material\r\nand better make would sit ill sorted on his gigantic limbs. His cotton\r\numbrella, without a handle, and tied together with a coarse string to\r\nkeep it from flapping, which he carried on his circuit rides, is said to\r\nbe remembered still by some of his surviving neighbors. This rusticity\r\nof habit was utterly free from that affected contempt of refinement and\r\ncomfort which self-made men sometimes carry into their more affluent\r\ncircumstances. To Abraham Lincoln it was entirely natural, and all those\r\nwho came into contact with him knew it to be so. In his ways of thinking\r\nand feeling he had become a gentleman in the highest sense, but the\r\nrefining process had polished but little the outward form. The plain\r\npeople, therefore, still considered “honest Abe Lincoln” one of\r\nthemselves; and when they felt, which they no doubt frequently did, that\r\nhis thoughts and aspirations moved in a sphere above their own,\r\nthey were all the more proud of him, without any diminution\r\nof fellow-feeling. It was this relation of mutual sympathy and\r\nunderstanding between Lincoln and the plain people that gave him his\r\npeculiar power as a public man, and singularly fitted him, as we shall\r\nsee, for that leadership which was preeminently required in the great\r\ncrisis then coming on,—the leadership which indeed thinks and moves\r\nahead of the masses, but always remains within sight and sympathetic\r\ntouch of them.\r\n\r\nHe entered upon the campaign of 1858 better equipped than he had ever\r\nbeen before. He not only instinctively felt, but he had convinced\r\nhimself by arduous study, that in this struggle against the spread of\r\nslavery he had right, justice, philosophy, the enlightened opinion of\r\nmankind, history, the Constitution, and good policy on his side. It\r\nwas observed that after he began to discuss the slavery question his\r\nspeeches were pitched in a much loftier key than his former oratorical\r\nefforts. While he remained fond of telling funny stories in private\r\nconversation, they disappeared more and more from his public discourse.\r\nHe would still now and then point his argument with expressions of\r\ninimitable quaintness, and flash out rays of kindly humor and witty\r\nirony; but his general tone was serious, and rose sometimes to genuine\r\nsolemnity. His masterly skill in dialectical thrust and parry, his\r\nwealth of knowledge, his power of reasoning and elevation of sentiment,\r\ndisclosed in language of rare precision, strength, and beauty, not\r\nseldom astonished his old friends.\r\n\r\nNeither of the two champions could have found a more formidable\r\nantagonist than each now met in the other. Douglas was by far the most\r\nconspicuous member of his party. His admirers had dubbed him “the Little\r\nGiant,” contrasting in that nickname the greatness of his mind with the\r\nsmallness of his body. But though of low stature, his broad-shouldered\r\nfigure appeared uncommonly sturdy, and there was something lion-like in\r\nthe squareness of his brow and jaw, and in the defiant shake of his long\r\nhair. His loud and persistent advocacy of territorial expansion, in the\r\nname of patriotism and “manifest destiny,” had given him an enthusiastic\r\nfollowing among the young and ardent. Great natural parts, a highly\r\ncombative temperament, and long training had made him a debater\r\nunsurpassed in a Senate filled with able men. He could be as forceful in\r\nhis appeals to patriotic feelings as he was fierce in denunciation and\r\nthoroughly skilled in all the baser tricks of parliamentary pugilism.\r\nWhile genial and rollicking in his social intercourse—the idol of the\r\n“boys” he felt himself one of the most renowned statesmen of his time,\r\nand would frequently meet his opponents with an overbearing haughtiness,\r\nas persons more to be pitied than to be feared. In his speech opening\r\nthe campaign of 1858, he spoke of Lincoln, whom the Republicans had\r\ndared to advance as their candidate for “his” place in the Senate, with\r\nan air of patronizing if not contemptuous condescension, as “a kind,\r\namiable, and intelligent gentleman and a good citizen.” The Little Giant\r\nwould have been pleased to pass off his antagonist as a tall dwarf. He\r\nknew Lincoln too well, however, to indulge himself seriously in such a\r\ndelusion. But the political situation was at that moment in a curious\r\ntangle, and Douglas could expect to derive from the confusion great\r\nadvantage over his opponent.\r\n\r\nBy the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, opening the Territories to the\r\ningress of slavery, Douglas had pleased the South, but greatly alarmed\r\nthe North. He had sought to conciliate Northern sentiment by appending\r\nto his Kansas-Nebraska Bill the declaration that its intent was “not\r\nto legislate slavery into any State or Territory, nor to exclude it\r\ntherefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form\r\nand regulate their institutions in their own way, subject only to the\r\nConstitution of the United States.” This he called “the great principle\r\nof popular sovereignty.” When asked whether, under this act, the people\r\nof a Territory, before its admission as a State, would have the right\r\nto exclude slavery, he answered, “That is a question for the courts\r\nto decide.” Then came the famous “Dred Scott decision,” in which the\r\nSupreme Court held substantially that the right to hold slaves\r\nas property existed in the Territories by virtue of the Federal\r\nConstitution, and that this right could not be denied by any act of a\r\nterritorial government. This, of course, denied the right of the people\r\nof any Territory to exclude slavery while they were in a territorial\r\ncondition, and it alarmed the Northern people still more. Douglas\r\nrecognized the binding force of the decision of the Supreme Court, at\r\nthe same time maintaining, most illogically, that his great principle\r\nof popular sovereignty remained in force nevertheless. Meanwhile, the\r\nproslavery people of western Missouri, the so-called “border ruffians,”\r\nhad invaded Kansas, set up a constitutional convention, made\r\na constitution of an extreme pro-slavery type, the “Lecompton\r\nConstitution,” refused to submit it fairly to a vote of the people of\r\nKansas, and then referred it to Congress for acceptance,—seeking thus\r\nto accomplish the admission of Kansas as a slave State. Had Douglas\r\nsupported such a scheme, he would have lost all foothold in the North.\r\nIn the name of popular sovereignty he loudly declared his opposition to\r\nthe acceptance of any constitution not sanctioned by a formal popular\r\nvote. He “did not care,” he said, “whether slavery be voted up or down,”\r\nbut there must be a fair vote of the people. Thus he drew upon himself\r\nthe hostility of the Buchanan administration, which was controlled by\r\nthe proslavery interest, but he saved his Northern following. More\r\nthan this, not only did his Democratic admirers now call him “the true\r\nchampion of freedom,” but even some Republicans of large influence,\r\nprominent among them Horace Greeley, sympathizing with Douglas in his\r\nfight against the Lecompton Constitution, and hoping to detach him\r\npermanently from the proslavery interest and to force a lasting breach\r\nin the Democratic party, seriously advised the Republicans of Illinois\r\nto give up their opposition to Douglas, and to help re-elect him to the\r\nSenate. Lincoln was not of that opinion. He believed that great popular\r\nmovements can succeed only when guided by their faithful friends, and\r\nthat the antislavery cause could not safely be entrusted to the keeping\r\nof one who “did not care whether slavery be voted up or down.” This\r\nopinion prevailed in Illinois; but the influences within the Republican\r\nparty over which it prevailed yielded only a reluctant acquiescence, if\r\nthey acquiesced at all, after having materially strengthened Douglas’s\r\nposition. Such was the situation of things when the campaign of 1858\r\nbetween Lincoln and Douglas began.\r\n\r\nLincoln opened the campaign on his side at the convention which\r\nnominated him as the Republican candidate for the senatorship, with\r\na memorable saying which sounded like a shout from the watchtower of\r\nhistory: “A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this\r\ngovernment cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not\r\nexpect the Union to be dissolved. I do not expect the house to fall, but\r\nI expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing or\r\nall the other. Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further\r\nspread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the\r\nbelief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction, or its advocates\r\nwill push it forward, till it shall become alike lawful in all the\r\nStates,—old as well as new, North as well as South.” Then he proceeded\r\nto point out that the Nebraska doctrine combined with the Dred Scott\r\ndecision worked in the direction of making the nation “all slave.” Here\r\nwas the “irrepressible conflict” spoken of by Seward a short time later,\r\nin a speech made famous mainly by that phrase. If there was any new\r\ndiscovery in it, the right of priority was Lincoln’s. This utterance\r\nproved not only his statesmanlike conception of the issue, but also,\r\nin his situation as a candidate, the firmness of his moral courage.\r\nThe friends to whom he had read the draught of this speech before he\r\ndelivered it warned him anxiously that its delivery might be fatal to\r\nhis success in the election. This was shrewd advice, in the ordinary\r\nsense. While a slaveholder could threaten disunion with impunity, the\r\nmere suggestion that the existence of slavery was incompatible with\r\nfreedom in the Union would hazard the political chances of any public\r\nman in the North. But Lincoln was inflexible. “It is true,” said he,\r\n“and I will deliver it as written.... I would rather be defeated with\r\nthese expressions in my speech held up and discussed before the people\r\nthan be victorious without them.” The statesman was right in his\r\nfar-seeing judgment and his conscientious statement of the truth, but\r\nthe practical politicians were also right in their prediction of the\r\nimmediate effect. Douglas instantly seized upon the declaration that a\r\nhouse divided against itself cannot stand as the main objective point of\r\nhis attack, interpreting it as an incitement to a “relentless sectional\r\nwar,” and there is no doubt that the persistent reiteration of this\r\ncharge served to frighten not a few timid souls.\r\n\r\nLincoln constantly endeavored to bring the moral and philosophical side\r\nof the subject to the foreground. “Slavery is wrong” was the keynote of\r\nall his speeches. To Douglas’s glittering sophism that the right of the\r\npeople of a Territory to have slavery or not, as they might desire, was\r\nin accordance with the principle of true popular sovereignty, he made\r\nthe pointed answer: “Then true popular sovereignty, according to Senator\r\nDouglas, means that, when one man makes another man his slave, no\r\nthird man shall be allowed to object.” To Douglas’s argument that\r\nthe principle which demanded that the people of a Territory should be\r\npermitted to choose whether they would have slavery or not “originated\r\nwhen God made man, and placed good and evil before him, allowing him\r\nto choose upon his own responsibility,” Lincoln solemnly replied: “No;\r\nGod—did not place good and evil before man, telling him to make his\r\nchoice. On the contrary, God did tell him there was one tree of the\r\nfruit of which he should not eat, upon pain of death.” He did not,\r\nhowever, place himself on the most advanced ground taken by the radical\r\nanti-slavery men. He admitted that, under the Constitution, “the\r\nSouthern people were entitled to a Congressional fugitive slave law,”\r\nalthough he did not approve the fugitive slave law then existing. He\r\ndeclared also that, if slavery were kept out of the Territories during\r\ntheir territorial existence, as it should be, and if then the people of\r\nany Territory, having a fair chance and a clear field, should do such\r\nan extraordinary thing as to adopt a slave constitution, uninfluenced by\r\nthe actual presence of the institution among them, he saw no alternative\r\nbut to admit such a Territory into the Union. He declared further that,\r\nwhile he should be exceedingly glad to see slavery abolished in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, he would, as a member of Congress, with his\r\npresent views, not endeavor to bring on that abolition except on\r\ncondition that emancipation be gradual, that it be approved by the\r\ndecision of a majority of voters in the District, and that compensation\r\nbe made to unwilling owners. On every available occasion, he pronounced\r\nhimself in favor of the deportation and colonization of the blacks, of\r\ncourse with their consent. He repeatedly disavowed any wish on his part\r\nto have social and political equality established between whites and\r\nblacks. On this point he summed up his views in a reply to Douglas’s\r\nassertion that the Declaration of Independence, in speaking of all men\r\nas being created equal, did not include the negroes, saying: “I do not\r\nunderstand the Declaration of Independence to mean that all men were\r\ncreated equal in all respects. They are not equal in color. But I\r\nbelieve that it does mean to declare that all men are equal in some\r\nrespects; they are equal in their right to life, liberty, and the\r\npursuit of happiness.”\r\n\r\nWith regard to some of these subjects Lincoln modified his position at\r\na later period, and it has been suggested that he would have professed\r\nmore advanced principles in his debates with Douglas, had he not feared\r\nthereby to lose votes. This view can hardly be sustained. Lincoln had\r\nthe courage of his opinions, but he was not a radical. The man who\r\nrisked his election by delivering, against the urgent protest of his\r\nfriends, the speech about “the house divided against itself” would not\r\nhave shrunk from the expression of more extreme views, had he really\r\nentertained them. It is only fair to assume that he said what at the\r\ntime he really thought, and that if, subsequently, his opinions changed,\r\nit was owing to new conceptions of good policy and of duty brought\r\nforth by an entirely new set of circumstances and exigencies. It\r\nis characteristic that he continued to adhere to the impracticable\r\ncolonization plan even after the Emancipation Proclamation had already\r\nbeen issued.\r\n\r\nBut in this contest Lincoln proved himself not only a debater, but\r\nalso a political strategist of the first order. The “kind, amiable, and\r\nintelligent gentleman,” as Douglas had been pleased to call him, was by\r\nno means as harmless as a dove. He possessed an uncommon share of that\r\nworldly shrewdness which not seldom goes with genuine simplicity of\r\ncharacter; and the political experience gathered in the Legislature\r\nand in Congress, and in many election campaigns, added to his keen\r\nintuitions, had made him as far-sighted a judge of the probable effects\r\nof a public man’s sayings or doings upon the popular mind, and as\r\naccurate a calculator in estimating political chances and forecasting\r\nresults, as could be found among the party managers in Illinois. And\r\nnow he perceived keenly the ugly dilemma in which Douglas found himself,\r\nbetween the Dred Scott decision, which declared the right to hold slaves\r\nto exist in the Territories by virtue of the Federal Constitution, and\r\nhis “great principle of popular sovereignty,” according to which the\r\npeople of a Territory, if they saw fit, were to have the right to\r\nexclude slavery therefrom. Douglas was twisting and squirming to\r\nthe best of his ability to avoid the admission that the two were\r\nincompatible. The question then presented itself if it would be good\r\npolicy for Lincoln to force Douglas to a clear expression of his opinion\r\nas to whether, the Dred Scott decision notwithstanding, “the people of a\r\nTerritory could in any lawful way exclude slavery from its limits prior\r\nto the formation of a State constitution.” Lincoln foresaw and predicted\r\nwhat Douglas would answer: that slavery could not exist in a Territory\r\nunless the people desired it and gave it protection by territorial\r\nlegislation. In an improvised caucus the policy of pressing the\r\ninterrogatory on Douglas was discussed. Lincoln’s friends unanimously\r\nadvised against it, because the answer foreseen would sufficiently\r\ncommend Douglas to the people of Illinois to insure his re-election to\r\nthe Senate. But Lincoln persisted. “I am after larger game,” said he.\r\n“If Douglas so answers, he can never be President, and the battle of\r\n1860 is worth a hundred of this.” The interrogatory was pressed upon\r\nDouglas, and Douglas did answer that, no matter what the decision of\r\nthe Supreme Court might be on the abstract question, the people of\r\na Territory had the lawful means to introduce or exclude slavery by\r\nterritorial legislation friendly or unfriendly to the institution.\r\nLincoln found it easy to show the absurdity of the proposition that, if\r\nslavery were admitted to exist of right in the Territories by virtue\r\nof the supreme law, the Federal Constitution, it could be kept out or\r\nexpelled by an inferior law, one made by a territorial Legislature.\r\nAgain the judgment of the politicians, having only the nearest object in\r\nview, proved correct: Douglas was reelected to the Senate. But Lincoln’s\r\njudgment proved correct also: Douglas, by resorting to the expedient\r\nof his “unfriendly legislation doctrine,” forfeited his last chance of\r\nbecoming President of the United States. He might have hoped to win, by\r\nsufficient atonement, his pardon from the South for his opposition\r\nto the Lecompton Constitution; but that he taught the people of the\r\nTerritories a trick by which they could defeat what the proslavery men\r\nconsidered a constitutional right, and that he called that trick\r\nlawful, this the slave power would never forgive. The breach between\r\nthe Southern and the Northern Democracy was thenceforth irremediable and\r\nfatal.\r\n\r\nThe Presidential election of 1860 approached. The struggle in Kansas,\r\nand the debates in Congress which accompanied it, and which not\r\nunfrequently provoked violent outbursts, continually stirred the popular\r\nexcitement. Within the Democratic party raged the war of factions. The\r\nnational Democratic convention met at Charleston on the 23d of April,\r\n1860. After a struggle of ten days between the adherents and the\r\nopponents of Douglas, during which the delegates from the cotton States\r\nhad withdrawn, the convention adjourned without having nominated any\r\ncandidates, to meet again in Baltimore on the 18th of June. There was no\r\nprospect, however, of reconciling the hostile elements. It appeared very\r\nprobable that the Baltimore convention would nominate Douglas, while\r\nthe seceding Southern Democrats would set up a candidate of their own,\r\nrepresenting extreme proslavery principles.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the national Republican convention assembled at Chicago on\r\nthe 16th of May, full of enthusiasm and hope. The situation was easily\r\nunderstood. The Democrats would have the South. In order to succeed\r\nin the election, the Republicans had to win, in addition to the States\r\ncarried by Fremont in 1856, those that were classed as “doubtful,”—New\r\nJersey, Pennsylvania, and Indiana, or Illinois in the place of either\r\nNew Jersey or Indiana. The most eminent Republican statesmen and leaders\r\nof the time thought of for the Presidency were Seward and Chase, both\r\nregarded as belonging to the more advanced order of antislavery men.\r\nOf the two, Seward had the largest following, mainly from New York,\r\nNew England, and the Northwest. Cautious politicians doubted seriously\r\nwhether Seward, to whom some phrases in his speeches had undeservedly\r\ngiven the reputation of a reckless radical, would be able to command the\r\nwhole Republican vote in the doubtful States. Besides, during his long\r\npublic career he had made enemies. It was evident that those who thought\r\nSeward’s nomination too hazardous an experiment would consider Chase\r\nunavailable for the same reason. They would then look round for an\r\n“available” man; and among the “available” men Abraham Lincoln was\r\neasily discovered to stand foremost. His great debate with Douglas had\r\ngiven him a national reputation. The people of the East being eager\r\nto see the hero of so dramatic a contest, he had been induced to visit\r\nseveral Eastern cities, and had astonished and delighted large and\r\ndistinguished audiences with speeches of singular power and originality.\r\nAn address delivered by him in the Cooper Institute in New York, before\r\nan audience containing a large number of important persons, was then,\r\nand has ever since been, especially praised as one of the most logical\r\nand convincing political speeches ever made in this country. The people\r\nof the West had grown proud of him as a distinctively Western great man,\r\nand his popularity at home had some peculiar features which could be\r\nexpected to exercise a potent charm. Nor was Lincoln’s name as that of\r\nan available candidate left to the chance of accidental discovery. It\r\nis indeed not probable that he thought of himself as a Presidential\r\npossibility, during his contest with Douglas for the senatorship. As\r\nlate as April, 1859, he had written to a friend who had approached him\r\non the subject that he did not think himself fit for the Presidency.\r\nThe Vice-Presidency was then the limit of his ambition. But some of\r\nhis friends in Illinois took the matter seriously in hand, and Lincoln,\r\nafter some hesitation, then formally authorized “the use of his name.”\r\nThe matter was managed with such energy and excellent judgment that,\r\nin the convention, he had not only the whole vote of Illinois to start\r\nwith, but won votes on all sides without offending any rival. A large\r\nmajority of the opponents of Seward went over to Abraham Lincoln, and\r\ngave him the nomination on the third ballot. As had been foreseen,\r\nDouglas was nominated by one wing of the Democratic party at Baltimore,\r\nwhile the extreme proslavery wing put Breckinridge into the field as\r\nits candidate. After a campaign conducted with the energy of genuine\r\nenthusiasm on the antislavery side the united Republicans defeated the\r\ndivided Democrats, and Lincoln was elected President by a majority of\r\nfifty-seven votes in the electoral colleges.\r\n\r\nThe result of the election had hardly been declared when the disunion\r\nmovement in the South, long threatened and carefully planned and\r\nprepared, broke out in the shape of open revolt, and nearly a month\r\nbefore Lincoln could be inaugurated as President of the United States\r\nseven Southern States had adopted ordinances of secession, formed an\r\nindependent confederacy, framed a constitution for it, and elected\r\nJefferson Davis its president, expecting the other slaveholding\r\nStates soon to join them. On the 11th of February, 1861, Lincoln left\r\nSpringfield for Washington; having, with characteristic simplicity,\r\nasked his law partner not to change the sign of the firm “Lincoln\r\nand Herndon” during the four years unavoidable absence of the senior\r\npartner, and having taken an affectionate and touching leave of his\r\nneighbors.\r\n\r\nThe situation which confronted the new President was appalling: the\r\nlarger part of the South in open rebellion, the rest of the slaveholding\r\nStates wavering preparing to follow; the revolt guided by determined,\r\ndaring, and skillful leaders; the Southern people, apparently full of\r\nenthusiasm and military spirit, rushing to arms, some of the forts\r\nand arsenals already in their possession; the government of the Union,\r\nbefore the accession of the new President, in the hands of men some of\r\nwhom actively sympathized with the revolt, while others were hampered by\r\ntheir traditional doctrines in dealing with it, and really gave it aid\r\nand comfort by their irresolute attitude; all the departments full of\r\n“Southern sympathizers” and honeycombed with disloyalty; the treasury\r\nempty, and the public credit at the lowest ebb; the arsenals ill\r\nsupplied with arms, if not emptied by treacherous practices; the regular\r\narmy of insignificant strength, dispersed over an immense surface, and\r\ndeprived of some of its best officers by defection; the navy small and\r\nantiquated. But that was not all. The threat of disunion had so often\r\nbeen resorted to by the slave power in years gone by that most Northern\r\npeople had ceased to believe in its seriousness. But, when disunion\r\nactually appeared as a stern reality, something like a chill swept\r\nthrough the whole Northern country. A cry for union and peace at any\r\nprice rose on all sides. Democratic partisanship reiterated this cry\r\nwith vociferous vehemence, and even many Republicans grew afraid of\r\nthe victory they had just achieved at the ballot-box, and spoke of\r\ncompromise. The country fairly resounded with the noise of “anticoercion\r\nmeetings.” Expressions of firm resolution from determined antislavery\r\nmen were indeed not wanting, but they were for a while almost drowned\r\nby a bewildering confusion of discordant voices. Even this was not\r\nall. Potent influences in Europe, with an ill-concealed desire for the\r\npermanent disruption of the American Union, eagerly espoused the cause\r\nof the Southern seceders, and the two principal maritime powers of the\r\nOld World seemed only to be waiting for a favorable opportunity to lend\r\nthem a helping hand.\r\n\r\nThis was the state of things to be mastered by “honest Abe Lincoln” when\r\nhe took his seat in the Presidential chair,—“honest Abe Lincoln,” who\r\nwas so good-natured that he could not say “no”; the greatest achievement\r\nin whose life had been a debate on the slavery question; who had never\r\nbeen in any position of power; who was without the slightest experience\r\nof high executive duties, and who had only a speaking acquaintance with\r\nthe men upon whose counsel and cooperation he was to depend. Nor was\r\nhis accession to power under such circumstances greeted with general\r\nconfidence even by the members of his party. While he had indeed won\r\nmuch popularity, many Republicans, especially among those who had\r\nadvocated Seward’s nomination for the Presidency, saw the simple\r\n“Illinois lawyer” take the reins of government with a feeling little\r\nshort of dismay. The orators and journals of the opposition were\r\nridiculing and lampooning him without measure. Many people actually\r\nwondered how such a man could dare to undertake a task which, as he\r\nhimself had said to his neighbors in his parting speech, was “more\r\ndifficult than that of Washington himself had been.”\r\n\r\nBut Lincoln brought to that task, aside from other uncommon qualities,\r\nthe first requisite,—an intuitive comprehension of its nature. While\r\nhe did not indulge in the delusion that the Union could be maintained or\r\nrestored without a conflict of arms, he could indeed not foresee all the\r\nproblems he would have to solve. He instinctively understood, however,\r\nby what means that conflict would have to be conducted by the government\r\nof a democracy. He knew that the impending war, whether great or small,\r\nwould not be like a foreign war, exciting a united national enthusiasm,\r\nbut a civil war, likely to fan to uncommon heat the animosities of party\r\neven in the localities controlled by the government; that this war would\r\nhave to be carried on not by means of a ready-made machinery, ruled\r\nby an undisputed, absolute will, but by means to be furnished by the\r\nvoluntary action of the people:—armies to be formed by voluntary\r\nenlistments; large sums of money to be raised by the people, through\r\nrepresentatives, voluntarily taxing themselves; trust of extraordinary\r\npower to be voluntarily granted; and war measures, not seldom\r\nrestricting the rights and liberties to which the citizen was\r\naccustomed, to be voluntarily accepted and submitted to by the people,\r\nor at least a large majority of them; and that this would have to be\r\nkept up not merely during a short period of enthusiastic excitement; but\r\npossibly through weary years of alternating success and disaster, hope\r\nand despondency. He knew that in order to steer this government by\r\npublic opinion successfully through all the confusion created by the\r\nprejudices and doubts and differences of sentiment distracting the\r\npopular mind, and so to propitiate, inspire, mould, organize, unite, and\r\nguide the popular will that it might give forth all the means required\r\nfor the performance of his great task, he would have to take into\r\naccount all the influences strongly affecting the current of popular\r\nthought and feeling, and to direct while appearing to obey.\r\n\r\nThis was the kind of leadership he intuitively conceived to be needed\r\nwhen a free people were to be led forward en masse to overcome a\r\ngreat common danger under circumstances of appalling difficulty, the\r\nleadership which does not dash ahead with brilliant daring, no matter\r\nwho follows, but which is intent upon rallying all the available forces,\r\ngathering in the stragglers, closing up the column, so that the front\r\nmay advance well supported. For this leadership Abraham Lincoln was\r\nadmirably fitted, better than any other American statesman of his day;\r\nfor he understood the plain people, with all their loves and hates,\r\ntheir prejudices and their noble impulses, their weaknesses and their\r\nstrength, as he understood himself, and his sympathetic nature was apt\r\nto draw their sympathy to him.\r\n\r\nHis inaugural address foreshadowed his official course in characteristic\r\nmanner. Although yielding nothing in point of principle, it was by no\r\nmeans a flaming antislavery manifesto, such as would have pleased the\r\nmore ardent Republicans. It was rather the entreaty of a sorrowing\r\nfather speaking to his wayward children. In the kindliest language\r\nhe pointed out to the secessionists how ill advised their attempt at\r\ndisunion was, and why, for their own sakes, they should desist. Almost\r\nplaintively, he told them that, while it was not their duty to destroy\r\nthe Union, it was his sworn duty to preserve it; that the least he\r\ncould do, under the obligations of his oath, was to possess and hold the\r\nproperty of the United States; that he hoped to do this peaceably; that\r\nhe abhorred war for any purpose, and that they would have none\r\nunless they themselves were the aggressors. It was a masterpiece of\r\npersuasiveness, and while Lincoln had accepted many valuable amendments\r\nsuggested by Seward, it was essentially his own. Probably Lincoln\r\nhimself did not expect his inaugural address to have any effect upon the\r\nsecessionists, for he must have known them to be resolved upon disunion\r\nat any cost. But it was an appeal to the wavering minds in the North,\r\nand upon them it made a profound impression. Every candid man, however\r\ntimid and halting, had to admit that the President was bound by his oath\r\nto do his duty; that under that oath he could do no less than he said\r\nhe would do; that if the secessionists resisted such an appeal as\r\nthe President had made, they were bent upon mischief, and that the\r\ngovernment must be supported against them. The partisan sympathy with\r\nthe Southern insurrection which still existed in the North did indeed\r\nnot disappear, but it diminished perceptibly under the influence of such\r\nreasoning. Those who still resisted it did so at the risk of appearing\r\nunpatriotic.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed, however, that Lincoln at once succeeded in\r\npleasing everybody, even among his friends,—even among those nearest to\r\nhim. In selecting his cabinet, which he did substantially before he left\r\nSpringfield for Washington, he thought it wise to call to his assistance\r\nthe strong men of his party, especially those who had given evidence of\r\nthe support they commanded as his competitors in the Chicago convention.\r\nIn them he found at the same time representatives of the\r\ndifferent shades of opinion within the party, and of the different\r\nelements—former Whigs and former Democrats—from which the party had\r\nrecruited itself. This was sound policy under the circumstances. It\r\nmight indeed have been foreseen that among the members of a cabinet so\r\ncomposed, troublesome disagreements and rivalries would break out. But\r\nit was better for the President to have these strong and ambitious\r\nmen near him as his co-operators than to have them as his critics in\r\nCongress, where their differences might have been composed in a common\r\nopposition to him. As members of his cabinet he could hope to control\r\nthem, and to keep them busily employed in the service of a common\r\npurpose, if he had the strength to do so. Whether he did possess this\r\nstrength was soon tested by a singularly rude trial.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the foremost members of his cabinet, Seward\r\nand Chase, the most eminent Republican statesmen, had felt themselves\r\nwronged by their party when in its national convention it preferred\r\nto them for the Presidency a man whom, not unnaturally, they thought\r\ngreatly their inferior in ability and experience as well as in service.\r\nThe soreness of that disappointment was intensified when they saw this\r\nWestern man in the White House, with so much of rustic manner and speech\r\nas still clung to him, meeting his fellow-citizens, high and low, on a\r\nfooting of equality, with the simplicity of his good nature unburdened\r\nby any conventional dignity of deportment, and dealing with the great\r\nbusiness of state in an easy-going, unmethodical, and apparently\r\nsomewhat irreverent way. They did not understand such a man. Especially\r\nSeward, who, as Secretary of State, considered himself next to the\r\nChief Executive, and who quickly accustomed himself to giving orders and\r\nmaking arrangements upon his own motion, thought it necessary that he\r\nshould rescue the direction of public affairs from hands so unskilled,\r\nand take full charge of them himself. At the end of the first month of\r\nthe administration he submitted a “memorandum” to President Lincoln,\r\nwhich has been first brought to light by Nicolay and Hay, and is one of\r\ntheir most valuable contributions to the history of those days. In that\r\npaper Seward actually told the President that at the end of a month’s\r\nadministration the government was still without a policy, either\r\ndomestic or foreign; that the slavery question should be eliminated from\r\nthe struggle about the Union; that the matter of the maintenance of the\r\nforts and other possessions in the South should be decided with that\r\nview; that explanations should be demanded categorically from the\r\ngovernments of Spain and France, which were then preparing, one for the\r\nannexation of San Domingo, and both for the invasion of Mexico; that\r\nif no satisfactory explanations were received war should be declared\r\nagainst Spain and France by the United States; that explanations should\r\nalso be sought from Russia and Great Britain, and a vigorous continental\r\nspirit of independence against European intervention be aroused all over\r\nthe American continent; that this policy should be incessantly pursued\r\nand directed by somebody; that either the President should devote\r\nhimself entirely to it, or devolve the direction on some member of his\r\ncabinet, whereupon all debate on this policy must end.\r\n\r\nThis could be understood only as a formal demand that the President\r\nshould acknowledge his own incompetency to perform his duties, content\r\nhimself with the amusement of distributing post-offices, and resign his\r\npower as to all important affairs into the hands of his Secretary of\r\nState. It seems to-day incomprehensible how a statesman of Seward’s\r\ncalibre could at that period conceive a plan of policy in which the\r\nslavery question had no place; a policy which rested upon the utterly\r\ndelusive assumption that the secessionists, who had already formed their\r\nSouthern Confederacy and were with stern resolution preparing to fight\r\nfor its independence, could be hoodwinked back into the Union by some\r\nsentimental demonstration against European interference; a policy which,\r\nat that critical moment, would have involved the Union in a foreign war,\r\nthus inviting foreign intervention in favor of the Southern Confederacy,\r\nand increasing tenfold its chances in the struggle for independence. But\r\nit is equally incomprehensible how Seward could fail to see that this\r\ndemand of an unconditional surrender was a mortal insult to the head\r\nof the government, and that by putting his proposition on paper he\r\ndelivered himself into the hands of the very man he had insulted; for,\r\nhad Lincoln, as most Presidents would have done, instantly dismissed\r\nSeward, and published the true reason for that dismissal, it would\r\ninevitably have been the end of Seward’s career. But Lincoln did what\r\nnot many of the noblest and greatest men in history would have been\r\nnoble and great enough to do. He considered that Seward was still\r\ncapable of rendering great service to his country in the place in\r\nwhich he was, if rightly controlled. He ignored the insult, but\r\nfirmly established his superiority. In his reply, which he forthwith\r\ndespatched, he told Seward that the administration had a domestic policy\r\nas laid down in the inaugural address with Seward’s approval; that\r\nit had a foreign policy as traced in Seward’s despatches with the\r\nPresident’s approval; that if any policy was to be maintained or\r\nchanged, he, the President, was to direct that on his responsibility;\r\nand that in performing that duty the President had a right to the\r\nadvice of his secretaries. Seward’s fantastic schemes of foreign war\r\nand continental policies Lincoln brushed aside by passing them over in\r\nsilence. Nothing more was said. Seward must have felt that he was at\r\nthe mercy of a superior man; that his offensive proposition had been\r\ngenerously pardoned as a temporary aberration of a great mind, and that\r\nhe could atone for it only by devoted personal loyalty. This he did.\r\nHe was thoroughly subdued, and thenceforth submitted to Lincoln his\r\ndespatches for revision and amendment without a murmur. The war with\r\nEuropean nations was no longer thought of; the slavery question found in\r\ndue time its proper place in the struggle for the Union; and when, at\r\na later period, the dismissal of Seward was demanded by dissatisfied\r\nsenators, who attributed to him the shortcomings of the administration,\r\nLincoln stood stoutly by his faithful Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nChase, the Secretary of the Treasury, a man of superb presence, of\r\neminent ability and ardent patriotism, of great natural dignity and a\r\ncertain outward coldness of manner, which made him appear more difficult\r\nof approach than he really was, did not permit his disappointment to\r\nburst out in such extravagant demonstrations. But Lincoln’s ways were\r\nso essentially different from his that they never became quite\r\nintelligible, and certainly not congenial to him. It might, perhaps,\r\nhave been better had there been, at the beginning of the administration,\r\nsome decided clash between Lincoln and Chase, as there was between\r\nLincoln and Seward, to bring on a full mutual explanation, and to make\r\nChase appreciate the real seriousness of Lincoln’s nature. But, as it\r\nwas, their relations always remained somewhat formal, and Chase never\r\nfelt quite at ease under a chief whom he could not understand, and whose\r\ncharacter and powers he never learned to esteem at their true value.\r\nAt the same time, he devoted himself zealously to the duties of his\r\ndepartment, and did the country arduous service under circumstances of\r\nextreme difficulty. Nobody recognized this more heartily than Lincoln\r\nhimself, and they managed to work together until near the end of\r\nLincoln’s first Presidential term, when Chase, after some disagreements\r\nconcerning appointments to office, resigned from the treasury; and,\r\nafter Taney’s death, the President made him Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the cabinet consisted of men of less eminence, who\r\nsubordinated themselves more easily. In January, 1862, Lincoln found it\r\nnecessary to bow Cameron out of the war office, and to put in his place\r\nEdwin M. Stanton, a man of intensely practical mind, vehement impulses,\r\nfierce positiveness, ruthless energy, immense working power, lofty\r\npatriotism, and severest devotion to duty. He accepted the war office\r\nnot as a partisan, for he had never been a Republican, but only to\r\ndo all he could in “helping to save the country.” The manner in\r\nwhich Lincoln succeeded in taming this lion to his will, by frankly\r\nrecognizing his great qualities, by giving him the most generous\r\nconfidence, by aiding him in his work to the full of his power, by\r\nkindly concession or affectionate persuasiveness in cases of differing\r\nopinions, or, when it was necessary, by firm assertions of superior\r\nauthority, bears the highest testimony to his skill in the management of\r\nmen. Stanton, who had entered the service with rather a mean opinion\r\nof Lincoln’s character and capacity, became one of his warmest, most\r\ndevoted, and most admiring friends, and with none of his secretaries\r\nwas Lincoln’s intercourse more intimate. To take advice with candid\r\nreadiness, and to weigh it without any pride of his own opinion, was one\r\nof Lincoln’s preeminent virtues; but he had not long presided over his\r\ncabinet council when his was felt by all its members to be the ruling\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nThe cautious policy foreshadowed in his inaugural address, and pursued\r\nduring the first period of the civil war, was far from satisfying all\r\nhis party friends. The ardent spirits among the Union men thought that\r\nthe whole North should at once be called to arms, to crush the rebellion\r\nby one powerful blow. The ardent spirits among the antislavery men\r\ninsisted that, slavery having brought forth the rebellion, this powerful\r\nblow should at once be aimed at slavery. Both complained that the\r\nadministration was spiritless, undecided, and lamentably slow in its\r\nproceedings. Lincoln reasoned otherwise. The ways of thinking and\r\nfeeling of the masses, of the plain people, were constantly present to\r\nhis mind. The masses, the plain people, had to furnish the men for the\r\nfighting, if fighting was to be done. He believed that the plain people\r\nwould be ready to fight when it clearly appeared necessary, and that\r\nthey would feel that necessity when they felt themselves attacked. He\r\ntherefore waited until the enemies of the Union struck the first blow.\r\nAs soon as, on the 12th of April, 1861, the first gun was fired in\r\nCharleston harbor on the Union flag upon Fort Sumter, the call was\r\nsounded, and the Northern people rushed to arms.\r\n\r\nLincoln knew that the plain people were now indeed ready to fight in\r\ndefence of the Union, but not yet ready to fight for the destruction of\r\nslavery. He declared openly that he had a right to summon the people to\r\nfight for the Union, but not to summon them to fight for the abolition\r\nof slavery as a primary object; and this declaration gave him numberless\r\nsoldiers for the Union who at that period would have hesitated to do\r\nbattle against the institution of slavery. For a time he succeeded\r\nin rendering harmless the cry of the partisan opposition that the\r\nRepublican administration were perverting the war for the Union into an\r\n“abolition war.” But when he went so far as to countermand the acts of\r\nsome generals in the field, looking to the emancipation of the slaves\r\nin the districts covered by their commands, loud complaints arose from\r\nearnest antislavery men, who accused the President of turning his back\r\nupon the antislavery cause. Many of these antislavery men will now,\r\nafter a calm retrospect, be willing to admit that it would have been\r\na hazardous policy to endanger, by precipitating a demonstrative fight\r\nagainst slavery, the success of the struggle for the Union.\r\n\r\nLincoln’s views and feelings concerning slavery had not changed. Those\r\nwho conversed with him intimately upon the subject at that period know\r\nthat he did not expect slavery long to survive the triumph of the Union,\r\neven if it were not immediately destroyed by the war. In this he was\r\nright. Had the Union armies achieved a decisive victory in an early\r\nperiod of the conflict, and had the seceded States been received back\r\nwith slavery, the “slave power” would then have been a defeated power,\r\ndefeated in an attempt to carry out its most effective threat. It would\r\nhave lost its prestige. Its menaces would have been hollow sound, and\r\nceased to make any one afraid. It could no longer have hoped to expand,\r\nto maintain an equilibrium in any branch of Congress, and to control the\r\ngovernment. The victorious free States would have largely overbalanced\r\nit. It would no longer have been able to withstand the onset of a\r\nhostile age. It could no longer have ruled,—and slavery had to rule in\r\norder to live. It would have lingered for a while, but it would surely\r\nhave been “in the course of ultimate extinction.” A prolonged war\r\nprecipitated the destruction of slavery; a short war might only have\r\nprolonged its death struggle. Lincoln saw this clearly; but he saw also\r\nthat, in a protracted death struggle, it might still have kept disloyal\r\nsentiments alive, bred distracting commotions, and caused great mischief\r\nto the country. He therefore hoped that slavery would not survive the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nBut the question how he could rightfully employ his power to bring on\r\nits speedy destruction was to him not a question of mere sentiment. He\r\nhimself set forth his reasoning upon it, at a later period, in one\r\nof his inimitable letters. “I am naturally antislavery,” said he. “If\r\nslavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong. I cannot remember the time when\r\nI did not so think and feel. And yet I have never understood that the\r\nPresidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act upon that\r\njudgment and feeling. It was in the oath I took that I would, to the\r\nbest of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of\r\nthe United States. I could not take the office without taking the oath.\r\nNor was it my view that I might take an oath to get power, and break\r\nthe oath in using that power. I understood, too, that, in ordinary civil\r\nadministration, this oath even forbade me practically to indulge my\r\nprivate abstract judgment on the moral question of slavery. I did\r\nunderstand, however, also, that my oath imposed upon me the duty of\r\npreserving, to the best of my ability, by every indispensable means,\r\nthat government, that nation, of which the Constitution was the organic\r\nlaw. I could not feel that, to the best of my ability, I had even tied\r\nto preserve the Constitution—if, to save slavery, or any minor matter,\r\nI should permit the wreck of government, country, and Constitution\r\nall together.” In other words, if the salvation of the government, the\r\nConstitution, and the Union demanded the destruction of slavery, he\r\nfelt it to be not only his right, but his sworn duty to destroy it. Its\r\ndestruction became a necessity of the war for the Union.\r\n\r\nAs the war dragged on and disaster followed disaster, the sense of that\r\nnecessity steadily grew upon him. Early in 1862, as some of his friends\r\nwell remember, he saw, what Seward seemed not to see, that to give\r\nthe war for the Union an antislavery character was the surest means to\r\nprevent the recognition of the Southern Confederacy as an independent\r\nnation by European powers; that, slavery being abhorred by the moral\r\nsense of civilized mankind, no European government would dare to offer\r\nso gross an insult to the public opinion of its people as openly to\r\nfavor the creation of a state founded upon slavery to the prejudice of\r\nan existing nation fighting against slavery. He saw also that slavery\r\nuntouched was to the rebellion an element of power, and that in order\r\nto overcome that power it was necessary to turn it into an element\r\nof weakness. Still, he felt no assurance that the plain people were\r\nprepared for so radical a measure as the emancipation of the slaves by\r\nact of the government, and he anxiously considered that, if they were\r\nnot, this great step might, by exciting dissension at the North, injure\r\nthe cause of the Union in one quarter more than it would help it in\r\nanother. He heartily welcomed an effort made in New York to mould and\r\nstimulate public sentiment on the slavery question by public meetings\r\nboldly pronouncing for emancipation. At the same time he himself\r\ncautiously advanced with a recommendation, expressed in a special\r\nmessage to Congress, that the United States should co-operate with any\r\nState which might adopt the gradual abolishment of slavery, giving\r\nsuch State pecuniary aid to compensate the former owners of emancipated\r\nslaves. The discussion was started, and spread rapidly. Congress adopted\r\nthe resolution recommended, and soon went a step farther in passing a\r\nbill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia. The plain people\r\nbegan to look at emancipation on a larger scale as a thing to be\r\nconsidered seriously by patriotic citizens; and soon Lincoln thought\r\nthat the time was ripe, and that the edict of freedom could be ventured\r\nupon without danger of serious confusion in the Union ranks.\r\n\r\nThe failure of McClellan’s movement upon Richmond increased immensely\r\nthe prestige of the enemy. The need of some great act to stimulate the\r\nvitality of the Union cause seemed to grow daily more pressing. On\r\nJuly 21, 1862, Lincoln surprised his cabinet with the draught of a\r\nproclamation declaring free the slaves in all the States that should be\r\nstill in rebellion against the United States on the 1st of January, 1863.\r\nAs to the matter itself he announced that he had fully made up his mind;\r\nhe invited advice only concerning the form and the time of publication.\r\nSeward suggested that the proclamation, if then brought out, amidst\r\ndisaster and distress, would sound like the last shriek of a perishing\r\ncause. Lincoln accepted the suggestion, and the proclamation was\r\npostponed. Another defeat followed, the second at Bull Run. But when,\r\nafter that battle, the Confederate army, under Lee, crossed the Potomac\r\nand invaded Maryland, Lincoln vowed in his heart that, if the Union army\r\nwere now blessed with success, the decree of freedom should surely\r\nbe issued. The victory of Antietam was won on September 17, and the\r\npreliminary Emancipation Proclamation came forth on the a 22d. It was\r\nLincoln’s own resolution and act; but practically it bound the nation,\r\nand permitted no step backward. In spite of its limitations, it was the\r\nactual abolition of slavery. Thus he wrote his name upon the books of\r\nhistory with the title dearest to his heart, the liberator of the slave.\r\n\r\nIt is true, the great proclamation, which stamped the war as one for\r\n“union and freedom,” did not at once mark the turning of the tide on the\r\nfield of military operations. There were more disasters, Fredericksburg\r\nand Chancellorsville. But with Gettysburg and Vicksburg the whole aspect\r\nof the war changed. Step by step, now more slowly, then more rapidly,\r\nbut with increasing steadiness, the flag of the Union advanced from\r\nfield to field toward the final consummation. The decree of emancipation\r\nwas naturally followed by the enlistment of emancipated negroes in the\r\nUnion armies. This measure had a anther reaching effect than merely\r\ngiving the Union armies an increased supply of men. The laboring force\r\nof the rebellion was hopelessly disorganized. The war became like a\r\nproblem of arithmetic. As the Union armies pushed forward, the area\r\nfrom which the Southern Confederacy could draw recruits and supplies\r\nconstantly grew smaller, while the area from which the Union recruited\r\nits strength constantly grew larger; and everywhere, even within the\r\nSouthern lines, the Union had its allies. The fate of the rebellion\r\nwas then virtually decided; but it still required much bloody work to\r\nconvince the brave warriors who fought for it that they were really\r\nbeaten.\r\n\r\nNeither did the Emancipation Proclamation forthwith command universal\r\nassent among the people who were loyal to the Union. There were even\r\nsigns of a reaction against the administration in the fall elections of\r\n1862, seemingly justifying the opinion, entertained by many, that the\r\nPresident had really anticipated the development of popular feeling. The\r\ncry that the war for the Union had been turned into an “abolition war”\r\nwas raised again by the opposition, and more loudly than ever. But\r\nthe good sense and patriotic instincts of the plain people gradually\r\nmarshalled themselves on Lincoln’s side, and he lost no opportunity to\r\nhelp on this process by personal argument and admonition. There never\r\nhas been a President in such constant and active contact with the public\r\nopinion of the country, as there never has been a President who, while\r\nat the head of the government, remained so near to the people. Beyond\r\nthe circle of those who had long known him the feeling steadily grew\r\nthat the man in the White House was “honest Abe Lincoln” still, and\r\nthat every citizen might approach him with complaint, expostulation, or\r\nadvice, without danger of meeting a rebuff from power-proud authority,\r\nor humiliating condescension; and this privilege was used by so many\r\nand with such unsparing freedom that only superhuman patience could\r\nhave endured it all. There are men now living who would to-day read with\r\namazement, if not regret, what they ventured to say or write to him. But\r\nLincoln repelled no one whom he believed to speak to him in good faith\r\nand with patriotic purpose. No good advice would go unheeded. No candid\r\ncriticism would offend him. No honest opposition, while it might pain\r\nhim, would produce a lasting alienation of feeling between him and the\r\nopponent. It may truly be said that few men in power have ever been\r\nexposed to more daring attempts to direct their course, to severer\r\ncensure of their acts, and to more cruel misrepresentation of their\r\nmotives: And all this he met with that good-natured humor peculiarly his\r\nown, and with untiring effort to see the right and to impress it\r\nupon those who differed from him. The conversations he had and the\r\ncorrespondence he carried on upon matters of public interest, not only\r\nwith men in official position, but with private citizens, were almost\r\nunceasing, and in a large number of public letters, written ostensibly\r\nto meetings, or committees, or persons of importance, he addressed\r\nhimself directly to the popular mind. Most of these letters stand among\r\nthe finest monuments of our political literature. Thus he presented the\r\nsingular spectacle of a President who, in the midst of a great civil\r\nwar, with unprecedented duties weighing upon him, was constantly in\r\nperson debating the great features of his policy with the people.\r\n\r\nWhile in this manner he exercised an ever-increasing influence upon the\r\npopular understanding, his sympathetic nature endeared him more and\r\nmore to the popular heart. In vain did journals and speakers of the\r\nopposition represent him as a lightminded trifler, who amused himself\r\nwith frivolous story-telling and coarse jokes, while the blood of the\r\npeople was flowing in streams. The people knew that the man at the head\r\nof affairs, on whose haggard face the twinkle of humor so frequently\r\nchanged into an expression of profoundest sadness, was more than any\r\nother deeply distressed by the suffering he witnessed; that he felt\r\nthe pain of every wound that was inflicted on the battlefield, and the\r\nanguish of every woman or child who had lost husband or father; that\r\nwhenever he could he was eager to alleviate sorrow, and that his mercy\r\nwas never implored in vain. They looked to him as one who was with them\r\nand of them in all their hopes and fears, their joys and sorrows, who\r\nlaughed with them and wept with them; and as his heart was theirs; so\r\ntheir hearts turned to him. His popularity was far different from\r\nthat of Washington, who was revered with awe, or that of Jackson,\r\nthe unconquerable hero, for whom party enthusiasm never grew weary\r\nof shouting. To Abraham Lincoln the people became bound by a genuine\r\nsentimental attachment. It was not a matter of respect, or confidence,\r\nor party pride, for this feeling spread far beyond the boundary lines of\r\nhis party; it was an affair of the heart, independent of mere reasoning.\r\nWhen the soldiers in the field or their folks at home spoke of “Father\r\nAbraham,” there was no cant in it. They felt that their President was\r\nreally caring for them as a father would, and that they could go to him,\r\nevery one of them, as they would go to a father, and talk to him of what\r\ntroubled them, sure to find a willing ear and tender sympathy. Thus,\r\ntheir President, and his cause, and his endeavors, and his success\r\ngradually became to them almost matters of family concern. And this\r\npopularity carried him triumphantly through the Presidential election\r\nof 1864, in spite of an opposition within his own party which at first\r\nseemed very formidable.\r\n\r\nMany of the radical antislavery men were never quite satisfied with\r\nLincoln’s ways of meeting the problems of the time. They were very\r\nearnest and mostly very able men, who had positive ideas as to “how this\r\nrebellion should be put down.” They would not recognize the necessity\r\nof measuring the steps of the government according to the progress\r\nof opinion among the plain people. They criticised Lincoln’s cautious\r\nmanagement as irresolute, halting, lacking in definite purpose and in\r\nenergy; he should not have delayed emancipation so long; he should not\r\nhave confided important commands to men of doubtful views as to slavery;\r\nhe should have authorized military commanders to set the slaves free\r\nas they went on; he dealt too leniently with unsuccessful generals; he\r\nshould have put down all factious opposition with a strong hand instead\r\nof trying to pacify it; he should have given the people accomplished\r\nfacts instead of arguing with them, and so on. It is true, these\r\ncriticisms were not always entirely unfounded. Lincoln’s policy had,\r\nwith the virtues of democratic government, some of its weaknesses, which\r\nin the presence of pressing exigencies were apt to deprive governmental\r\naction of the necessary vigor; and his kindness of heart, his\r\ndisposition always to respect the feelings of others, frequently made\r\nhim recoil from anything like severity, even when severity was urgently\r\ncalled for. But many of his radical critics have since then revised\r\ntheir judgment sufficiently to admit that Lincoln’s policy was, on the\r\nwhole, the wisest and safest; that a policy of heroic methods, while it\r\nhas sometimes accomplished great results, could in a democracy like\r\nours be maintained only by constant success; that it would have quickly\r\nbroken down under the weight of disaster; that it might have been\r\nsuccessful from the start, had the Union, at the beginning of the\r\nconflict, had its Grants and Shermans and Sheridans, its Farraguts and\r\nPorters, fully matured at the head of its forces; but that, as the great\r\ncommanders had to be evolved slowly from the developments of the war,\r\nconstant success could not be counted upon, and it was best to follow\r\na policy which was in friendly contact with the popular force, and\r\ntherefore more fit to stand trial of misfortune on the battlefield. But\r\nat that period they thought differently, and their dissatisfaction with\r\nLincoln’s doings was greatly increased by the steps he took toward the\r\nreconstruction of rebel States then partially in possession of the Union\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1863, Lincoln issued an amnesty proclamation, offering\r\npardon to all implicated in the rebellion, with certain specified\r\nexceptions, on condition of their taking and maintaining an oath to\r\nsupport the Constitution and obey the laws of the United States and the\r\nproclamations of the President with regard to slaves; and also promising\r\nthat when, in any of the rebel States, a number of citizens equal to one\r\ntenth of the voters in 1860 should re-establish a state government in\r\nconformity with the oath above mentioned, such should be recognized\r\nby the Executive as the true government of the State. The proclamation\r\nseemed at first to be received with general favor. But soon another\r\nscheme of reconstruction, much more stringent in its provisions, was put\r\nforward in the House of Representatives by Henry Winter Davis. Benjamin\r\nWade championed it in the Senate. It passed in the closing moments of\r\nthe session in July, 1864, and Lincoln, instead of making it a law by\r\nhis signature, embodied the text of it in a proclamation as a plan of\r\nreconstruction worthy of being earnestly considered. The differences of\r\nopinion concerning this subject had only intensified the feeling against\r\nLincoln which had long been nursed among the radicals, and some of\r\nthem openly declared their purpose of resisting his re-election to\r\nthe Presidency. Similar sentiments were manifested by the advanced\r\nantislavery men of Missouri, who, in their hot faction-fight with the\r\n“conservatives” of that State, had not received from Lincoln the active\r\nsupport they demanded. Still another class of Union men, mainly in the\r\nEast, gravely shook their heads when considering the question whether\r\nLincoln should be re-elected. They were those who cherished in their\r\nminds an ideal of statesmanship and of personal bearing in high office\r\nwith which, in their opinion, Lincoln’s individuality was much out of\r\naccord. They were shocked when they heard him cap an argument upon grave\r\naffairs of state with a story about “a man out in Sangamon County,”—a\r\nstory, to be sure, strikingly clinching his point, but sadly lacking in\r\ndignity. They could not understand the man who was capable, in opening\r\na cabinet meeting, of reading to his secretaries a funny chapter from a\r\nrecent book of Artemus Ward, with which in an unoccupied moment he had\r\nrelieved his care-burdened mind, and who then solemnly informed the\r\nexecutive council that he had vowed in his heart to issue a proclamation\r\nemancipating the slaves as soon as God blessed the Union arms with\r\nanother victory. They were alarmed at the weakness of a President who\r\nwould indeed resist the urgent remonstrances of statesmen against his\r\npolicy, but could not resist the prayer of an old woman for the pardon\r\nof a soldier who was sentenced to be shot for desertion. Such men,\r\nmostly sincere and ardent patriots, not only wished, but earnestly set\r\nto work, to prevent Lincoln’s renomination. Not a few of them actually\r\nbelieved, in 1863, that, if the national convention of the Union party\r\nwere held then, Lincoln would not be supported by the delegation of a\r\nsingle State. But when the convention met at Baltimore, in June, 1864,\r\nthe voice of the people was heard. On the first ballot Lincoln received\r\nthe votes of the delegations from all the States except Missouri; and\r\neven the Missourians turned over their votes to him before the result of\r\nthe ballot was declared.\r\n\r\nBut even after his renomination the opposition to Lincoln within the\r\nranks of the Union party did not subside. A convention, called by the\r\ndissatisfied radicals in Missouri, and favored by men of a similar\r\nway of thinking in other States, had been held already in May, and\r\nhad nominated as its candidate for the Presidency General Fremont. He,\r\nindeed, did not attract a strong following, but opposition movements\r\nfrom different quarters appeared more formidable. Henry Winter Davis and\r\nBenjamin Wade assailed Lincoln in a flaming manifesto. Other Union men,\r\nof undoubted patriotism and high standing, persuaded themselves, and\r\nsought to persuade the people, that Lincoln’s renomination was ill\r\nadvised and dangerous to the Union cause. As the Democrats had put off\r\ntheir convention until the 29th of August, the Union party had, during\r\nthe larger part of the summer, no opposing candidate and platform to\r\nattack, and the political campaign languished. Neither were the tidings\r\nfrom the theatre of war of a cheering character. The terrible losses\r\nsuffered by Grant’s army in the battles of the Wilderness spread general\r\ngloom. Sherman seemed for a while to be in a precarious position before\r\nAtlanta. The opposition to Lincoln within the Union party grew louder in\r\nits complaints and discouraging predictions. Earnest demands were heard\r\nthat his candidacy should be withdrawn. Lincoln himself, not knowing\r\nhow strongly the masses were attached to him, was haunted by dark\r\nforebodings of defeat. Then the scene suddenly changed as if by magic.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats, in their national convention, declared the war a failure,\r\ndemanded, substantially, peace at any price, and nominated on such a\r\nplatform General McClellan as their candidate. Their convention had\r\nhardly adjourned when the capture of Atlanta gave a new aspect to the\r\nmilitary situation. It was like a sun-ray bursting through a dark\r\ncloud. The rank and file of the Union party rose with rapidly growing\r\nenthusiasm. The song “We are coming, Father Abraham, three hundred\r\nthousand strong,” resounded all over the land. Long before the decisive\r\nday arrived, the result was beyond doubt, and Lincoln was re-elected\r\nPresident by overwhelming majorities. The election over even his\r\nseverest critics found themselves forced to admit that Lincoln was the\r\nonly possible candidate for the Union party in 1864, and that neither\r\npolitical combinations nor campaign speeches, nor even victories in the\r\nfield, were needed to insure his success. The plain people had all the\r\nwhile been satisfied with Abraham Lincoln: they confided in him; they\r\nloved him; they felt themselves near to him; they saw personified in him\r\nthe cause of Union and freedom; and they went to the ballot-box for him\r\nin their strength.\r\n\r\nThe hour of triumph called out the characteristic impulses of his\r\nnature. The opposition within the Union party had stung him to the\r\nquick. Now he had his opponents before him, baffled and humiliated. Not\r\na moment did he lose to stretch out the hand of friendship to all. “Now\r\nthat the election is over,” he said, in response to a serenade, “may not\r\nall, having a common interest, reunite in a common effort to save our\r\ncommon country? For my own part, I have striven, and will strive, to\r\nplace no obstacle in the way. So long as I have been here I have not\r\nwillingly planted a thorn in any man’s bosom. While I am deeply\r\nsensible to the high compliment of a re-election, it adds nothing to\r\nmy satisfaction that any other man may be pained or disappointed by the\r\nresult. May I ask those who were with me to join with me in the same\r\nspirit toward those who were against me?” This was Abraham Lincoln’s\r\ncharacter as tested in the furnace of prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe war was virtually decided, but not yet ended. Sherman was\r\nirresistibly carrying the Union flag through the South. Grant had his\r\niron hand upon the ramparts of Richmond. The days of the Confederacy\r\nwere evidently numbered. Only the last blow remained to be struck. Then\r\nLincoln’s second inauguration came, and with it his second inaugural\r\naddress. Lincoln’s famous “Gettysburg speech” has been much and justly\r\nadmired. But far greater, as well as far more characteristic, was that\r\ninaugural in which he poured out the whole devotion and tenderness of\r\nhis great soul. It had all the solemnity of a father’s last admonition\r\nand blessing to his children before he lay down to die. These were\r\nits closing words: “Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this\r\nmighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet if God wills that it\r\ncontinue until all the wealth piled up by the bondman’s two hundred and\r\nfifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of\r\nblood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword,\r\nas was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said, ‘The\r\njudgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.’ With malice\r\ntoward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God\r\ngives us to see the right, let us strive to finish the work we are in;\r\nto bind up the nation’s wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the\r\nbattle, and for his widow and his orphan; to do all which may achieve\r\nand cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all\r\nnations.”\r\n\r\nThis was like a sacred poem. No American President had ever spoken words\r\nlike these to the American people. America never had a President who\r\nfound such words in the depth of his heart.\r\n\r\nNow followed the closing scenes of the war. The Southern armies fought\r\nbravely to the last, but all in vain. Richmond fell. Lincoln himself\r\nentered the city on foot, accompanied only by a few officers and a\r\nsquad of sailors who had rowed him ashore from the flotilla in the James\r\nRiver, a negro picked up on the way serving as a guide. Never had the\r\nworld seen a more modest conqueror and a more characteristic triumphal\r\nprocession, no army with banners and drums, only a throng of those who\r\nhad been slaves, hastily run together, escorting the victorious chief\r\ninto the capital of the vanquished foe. We are told that they pressed\r\naround him, kissed his hands and his garments, and shouted and danced\r\nfor joy, while tears ran down the President’s care-furrowed cheeks.\r\n\r\nA few days more brought the surrender of Lee’s army, and peace was\r\nassured. The people of the North were wild with joy. Everywhere\r\nfestive guns were booming, bells pealing, the churches ringing with\r\nthanksgivings, and jubilant multitudes thronging the thoroughfares, when\r\nsuddenly the news flashed over the land that Abraham Lincoln had been\r\nmurdered. The people were stunned by the blow. Then a wail of sorrow\r\nwent up such as America had never heard before. Thousands of Northern\r\nhouseholds grieved as if they had lost their dearest member. Many a\r\nSouthern man cried out in his heart that his people had been robbed\r\nof their best friend in their humiliation and distress, when Abraham\r\nLincoln was struck down. It was as if the tender affection which his\r\ncountrymen bore him had inspired all nations with a common sentiment.\r\nAll civilized mankind stood mourning around the coffin of the dead\r\nPresident. Many of those, here and abroad, who not long before had\r\nridiculed and reviled him were among the first to hasten on with their\r\nflowers of eulogy, and in that universal chorus of lamentation and\r\npraise there was not a voice that did not tremble with genuine emotion.\r\nNever since Washington’s death had there been such unanimity of judgment\r\nas to a man’s virtues and greatness; and even Washington’s death,\r\nalthough his name was held in greater reverence, did not touch so\r\nsympathetic a chord in the people’s hearts.\r\n\r\nNor can it be said that this was owing to the tragic character of\r\nLincoln’s end. It is true, the death of this gentlest and most merciful\r\nof rulers by the hand of a mad fanatic was well apt to exalt him beyond\r\nhis merits in the estimation of those who loved him, and to make his\r\nrenown the object of peculiarly tender solicitude. But it is also true\r\nthat the verdict pronounced upon him in those days has been affected\r\nlittle by time, and that historical inquiry has served rather to\r\nincrease than to lessen the appreciation of his virtues, his abilities,\r\nhis services. Giving the fullest measure of credit to his great\r\nministers,—to Seward for his conduct of foreign affairs, to Chase for\r\nthe management of the finances under terrible difficulties, to Stanton\r\nfor the performance of his tremendous task as war secretary,—and\r\nreadily acknowledging that without the skill and fortitude of the great\r\ncommanders, and the heroism of the soldiers and sailors under them,\r\nsuccess could not have been achieved, the historian still finds that\r\nLincoln’s judgment and will were by no means governed by those around\r\nhim; that the most important steps were owing to his initiative; that\r\nhis was the deciding and directing mind; and that it was pre-eminently\r\nhe whose sagacity and whose character enlisted for the administration\r\nin its struggles the countenance, the sympathy, and the support of the\r\npeople. It is found, even, that his judgment on military matters was\r\nastonishingly acute, and that the advice and instructions he gave to the\r\ngenerals commanding in the field would not seldom have done honor to the\r\nablest of them. History, therefore, without overlooking, or palliating,\r\nor excusing any of his shortcomings or mistakes, continues to place\r\nhim foremost among the saviours of the Union and the liberators of the\r\nslave. More than that, it awards to him the merit of having accomplished\r\nwhat but few political philosophers would have recognized as\r\npossible,—of leading the republic through four years of furious civil\r\nconflict without any serious detriment to its free institutions.\r\n\r\nHe was, indeed, while President, violently denounced by the opposition\r\nas a tyrant and a usurper, for having gone beyond his constitutional\r\npowers in authorizing or permitting the temporary suppression of\r\nnewspapers, and in wantonly suspending the writ of habeas corpus and\r\nresorting to arbitrary arrests. Nobody should be blamed who, when such\r\nthings are done, in good faith and from patriotic motives protests\r\nagainst them. In a republic, arbitrary stretches of power, even when\r\ndemanded by necessity, should never be permitted to pass without a\r\nprotest on the one hand, and without an apology on the other. It is well\r\nthey did not so pass during our civil war. That arbitrary measures were\r\nresorted to is true. That they were resorted to most sparingly, and only\r\nwhen the government thought them absolutely required by the safety of\r\nthe republic, will now hardly be denied. But certain it is that the\r\nhistory of the world does not furnish a single example of a government\r\npassing through so tremendous a crisis as our civil war was with so\r\nsmall a record of arbitrary acts, and so little interference with the\r\nordinary course of law outside the field of military operations. No\r\nAmerican President ever wielded such power as that which was thrust into\r\nLincoln’s hands. It is to be hoped that no American President ever\r\nwill have to be entrusted with such power again. But no man was ever\r\nentrusted with it to whom its seductions were less dangerous than they\r\nproved to be to Abraham Lincoln. With scrupulous care he endeavored,\r\neven under the most trying circumstances, to remain strictly within the\r\nconstitutional limitations of his authority; and whenever the boundary\r\nbecame indistinct, or when the dangers of the situation forced him\r\nto cross it, he was equally careful to mark his acts as exceptional\r\nmeasures, justifiable only by the imperative necessities of the civil\r\nwar, so that they might not pass into history as precedents for similar\r\nacts in time of peace. It is an unquestionable fact that during the\r\nreconstruction period which followed the war, more things were done\r\ncapable of serving as dangerous precedents than during the war itself.\r\nThus it may truly be said of him not only that under his guidance the\r\nrepublic was saved from disruption and the country was purified of the\r\nblot of slavery, but that, during the stormiest and most perilous crisis\r\nin our history, he so conducted the government and so wielded his almost\r\ndictatorial power as to leave essentially intact our free institutions\r\nin all things that concern the rights and liberties of the citizens.\r\nHe understood well the nature of the problem. In his first message to\r\nCongress he defined it in admirably pointed language: “Must a government\r\nbe of necessity too strong for the liberties of its own people, or\r\ntoo weak to maintain its own existence? Is there in all republics this\r\ninherent weakness?” This question he answered in the name of the great\r\nAmerican republic, as no man could have answered it better, with a\r\ntriumphant “No....”\r\n\r\nIt has been said that Abraham Lincoln died at the right moment for his\r\nfame. However that may be, he had, at the time of his death, certainly\r\nnot exhausted his usefulness to his country. He was probably the only\r\nman who could have guided the nation through the perplexities of the\r\nreconstruction period in such a manner as to prevent in the work of\r\npeace the revival of the passions of the war. He would indeed not have\r\nescaped serious controversy as to details of policy; but he could have\r\nweathered it far better than any other statesman of his time, for his\r\nprestige with the active politicians had been immensely strengthened by\r\nhis triumphant re-election; and, what is more important, he would have\r\nbeen supported by the confidence of the victorious Northern people that\r\nhe would do all to secure the safety of the Union and the rights of\r\nthe emancipated negro, and at the same time by the confidence of the\r\ndefeated Southern people that nothing would be done by him from motives\r\nof vindictiveness, or of unreasoning fanaticism, or of a selfish party\r\nspirit. “With malice toward none, with charity for all,” the foremost\r\nof the victors would have personified in himself the genius of\r\nreconciliation.\r\n\r\nHe might have rendered the country a great service in another direction.\r\nA few days after the fall of Richmond, he pointed out to a friend the\r\ncrowd of office-seekers besieging his door. “Look at that,” said he.\r\n“Now we have conquered the rebellion, but here you see something that\r\nmay become more dangerous to this republic than the rebellion itself.”\r\nIt is true, Lincoln as President did not profess what we now call civil\r\nservice reform principles. He used the patronage of the government\r\nin many cases avowedly to reward party work, in many others to form\r\ncombinations and to produce political effects advantageous to the Union\r\ncause, and in still others simply to put the right man into the right\r\nplace. But in his endeavors to strengthen the Union cause, and in his\r\nsearch for able and useful men for public duties, he frequently went\r\nbeyond the limits of his party, and gradually accustomed himself to the\r\nthought that, while party service had its value, considerations of\r\nthe public interest were, as to appointments to office, of far greater\r\nconsequence. Moreover, there had been such a mingling of different\r\npolitical elements in support of the Union during the civil war that\r\nLincoln, standing at the head of that temporarily united motley mass,\r\nhardly felt himself, in the narrow sense of the term, a party man.\r\nAnd as he became strongly impressed with the dangers brought upon the\r\nrepublic by the use of public offices as party spoils, it is by no means\r\nimprobable that, had he survived the all-absorbing crisis and found time\r\nto turn to other objects, one of the most important reforms of later\r\ndays would have been pioneered by his powerful authority. This was\r\nnot to be. But the measure of his achievements was full enough for\r\nimmortality.\r\n\r\nTo the younger generation Abraham Lincoln has already become a\r\nhalf-mythical figure, which, in the haze of historic distance, grows\r\nto more and more heroic proportions, but also loses in distinctness of\r\noutline and feature. This is indeed the common lot of popular heroes;\r\nbut the Lincoln legend will be more than ordinarily apt to become\r\nfanciful, as his individuality, assembling seemingly incongruous\r\nqualities and forces in a character at the same time grand and most\r\nlovable, was so unique, and his career so abounding in startling\r\ncontrasts. As the state of society in which Abraham Lincoln grew up\r\npasses away, the world will read with increasing wonder of the man who,\r\nnot only of the humblest origin, but remaining the simplest and\r\nmost unpretending of citizens, was raised to a position of power\r\nunprecedented in our history; who was the gentlest and most peace-loving\r\nof mortals, unable to see any creature suffer without a pang in his own\r\nbreast, and suddenly found himself called to conduct the greatest and\r\nbloodiest of our wars; who wielded the power of government when stern\r\nresolution and relentless force were the order of the day and then won\r\nand ruled the popular mind and heart by the tender sympathies of his\r\nnature; who was a cautious conservative by temperament and mental habit,\r\nand led the most sudden and sweeping social revolution of our time;\r\nwho, preserving his homely speech and rustic manner even in the most\r\nconspicuous position of that period, drew upon himself the scoffs of\r\npolite society, and then thrilled the soul of mankind with utterances of\r\nwonderful beauty and grandeur; who, in his heart the best friend of the\r\ndefeated South, was murdered because a crazy fanatic took him for its\r\nmost cruel enemy; who, while in power, was beyond measure lampooned and\r\nmaligned by sectional passion and an excited party spirit, and around\r\nwhose bier friend and foe gathered to praise him which they have since\r\nnever ceased to do—as one of the greatest of Americans and the best of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN, BY JOSEPH H. CHOATE\r\n\r\n\r\n[This Address was delivered before the Edinburgh Philosophical\r\nInstitution, November 13, 1900. It is included in this set with the\r\ncourteous permission of the author and of Messrs. Thomas Y. Crowell &\r\nCompany.]\r\n\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nWhen you asked me to deliver the Inaugural Address on this occasion,\r\nI recognized that I owed this compliment to the fact that I was the\r\nofficial representative of America, and in selecting a subject I\r\nventured to think that I might interest you for an hour in a brief study\r\nin popular government, as illustrated by the life of the most American\r\nof all Americans. I therefore offer no apology for asking your attention\r\nto Abraham Lincoln—to his unique character and the part he bore in\r\ntwo important achievements of modern history: the preservation of the\r\nintegrity of the American Union and the emancipation of the colored\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nDuring his brief term of power he was probably the object of more abuse,\r\nvilification, and ridicule than any other man in the world; but when he\r\nfell by the hand of an assassin, at the very moment of his stupendous\r\nvictory, all the nations of the earth vied with one another in paying\r\nhomage to his character, and the thirty-five years that have since\r\nelapsed have established his place in history as one of the great\r\nbenefactors not of his own country alone, but of the human race.\r\n\r\nOne of many noble utterances upon the occasion of his death was that in\r\nwhich ‘Punch’ made its magnanimous recantation of the spirit with which\r\nit had pursued him:\r\n\r\n  “Beside this corpse that bears for winding sheet\r\n   The stars and stripes he lived to rear anew,\r\n   Between the mourners at his head and feet,\r\n   Say, scurrile jester, is there room for you?\r\n\r\n          ...................\r\n\r\n  “Yes, he had lived to shame me from my sneer,\r\n   To lame my pencil, and confute my pen\r\n   To make me own this hind—of princes peer,\r\n   This rail-splitter—a true born king of men.”\r\n\r\nFiction can furnish no match for the romance of his life, and biography\r\nwill be searched in vain for such startling vicissitudes of fortune,\r\nso great power and glory won out of such humble beginnings and adverse\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nDoubtless you are all familiar with the salient points of his\r\nextraordinary career. In the zenith of his fame he was the wise,\r\npatient, courageous, successful ruler of men; exercising more power than\r\nany monarch of his time, not for himself, but for the good of the people\r\nwho had placed it in his hands; commander-in-chief of a vast military\r\npower, which waged with ultimate success the greatest war of the\r\ncentury; the triumphant champion of popular government, the deliverer\r\nof four millions of his fellowmen from bondage; honored by mankind as\r\nStatesman, President, and Liberator.\r\n\r\nLet us glance now at the first half of the brief life of which this was\r\nthe glorious and happy consummation. Nothing could be more squalid and\r\nmiserable than the home in which Abraham Lincoln was born—a one-roomed\r\ncabin without floor or window in what was then the wilderness of\r\nKentucky, in the heart of that frontier life which swiftly moved\r\nwestward from the Alleghanies to the Mississippi, always in advance of\r\nschools and churches, of books and money, of railroads and newspapers,\r\nof all things which are generally regarded as the comforts and even\r\nnecessaries of life. His father, ignorant, needy, and thriftless,\r\ncontent if he could keep soul and body together for himself and his\r\nfamily, was ever seeking, without success, to better his unhappy\r\ncondition by moving on from one such scene of dreary desolation to\r\nanother. The rude society which surrounded them was not much better. The\r\nstruggle for existence was hard, and absorbed all their energies. They\r\nwere fighting the forest, the wild beast, and the retreating savage.\r\nFrom the time when he could barely handle tools until he attained his\r\nmajority, Lincoln’s life was that of a simple farm laborer, poorly clad,\r\nhoused, and fed, at work either on his father’s wretched farm or hired\r\nout to neighboring farmers. But in spite, or perhaps by means, of this\r\nrude environment, he grew to be a stalwart giant, reaching six feet four\r\nat nineteen, and fabulous stories are told of his feats of strength.\r\nWith the growth of this mighty frame began that strange education which\r\nin his ripening years was to qualify him for the great destiny that\r\nawaited him, and the development of those mental faculties and moral\r\nendowments which, by the time he reached middle life, were to make him\r\nthe sagacious, patient, and triumphant leader of a great nation in the\r\ncrisis of its fate. His whole schooling, obtained during such odd times\r\nas could be spared from grinding labor, did not amount in all to as much\r\nas one year, and the quality of the teaching was of the lowest possible\r\ngrade, including only the elements of reading, writing, and ciphering.\r\nBut out of these simple elements, when rightly used by the right man,\r\neducation is achieved, and Lincoln knew how to use them. As so often\r\nhappens, he seemed to take warning from his father’s unfortunate\r\nexample. Untiring industry, an insatiable thirst for knowledge, and\r\nan ever-growing desire to rise above his surroundings, were early\r\nmanifestations of his character.\r\n\r\nBooks were almost unknown in that community, but the Bible was in\r\nevery house, and somehow or other Pilgrim’s Progress, AEsop’s Fables,\r\na History of the United States, and a Life of Washington fell into his\r\nhands. He trudged on foot many miles through the wilderness to borrow an\r\nEnglish Grammar, and is said to have devoured greedily the contents of\r\nthe Statutes of Indiana that fell in his way. These few volumes he read\r\nand reread—and his power of assimilation was great. To be shut in with\r\na few books and to master them thoroughly sometimes does more for the\r\ndevelopment of character than freedom to range at large, in a cursory\r\nand indiscriminate way, through wide domains of literature. This youth’s\r\nmind, at any rate, was thoroughly saturated with Biblical knowledge and\r\nBiblical language, which, in after life, he used with great readiness\r\nand effect. But it was the constant use of the little knowledge which he\r\nhad that developed and exercised his mental powers. After the hard\r\nday’s work was done, while others slept, he toiled on, always reading or\r\nwriting. From an early age he did his own thinking and made up his own\r\nmind—invaluable traits in the future President. Paper was such a scarce\r\ncommodity that, by the evening firelight, he would write and cipher\r\non the back of a wooden shovel, and then shave it off to make room for\r\nmore. By and by, as he approached manhood, he began speaking in the rude\r\ngatherings of the neighborhood, and so laid the foundation of that art\r\nof persuading his fellow-men which was one rich result of his education,\r\nand one great secret of his subsequent success.\r\n\r\nAccustomed as we are in these days of steam and telegraphs to have every\r\nintelligent boy survey the whole world each morning before breakfast,\r\nand inform himself as to what is going on in every nation, it is hardly\r\npossible to conceive how benighted and isolated was the condition of the\r\ncommunity at Pigeon Creek in Indiana, of which the family of Lincoln’s\r\nfather formed a part, or how eagerly an ambitious and high-spirited boy,\r\nsuch as he, must have yearned to escape. The first glimpse that he ever\r\ngot of any world beyond the narrow confines of his home was in 1828, at\r\nthe age of nineteen, when a neighbor employed him to accompany his son\r\ndown the river to New Orleans to dispose of a flatboat of produce—a\r\ncommission which he discharged with great success.\r\n\r\nShortly after his return from this his first excursion into the outer\r\nworld, his father, tired of failure in Indiana, packed his family and\r\nall his worldly goods into a single wagon drawn by two yoke of oxen, and\r\nafter a fourteen days’ tramp through the wilderness, pitched his camp\r\nonce more, in Illinois. Here Abraham, having come of age and being now\r\nhis own master, rendered the last service of his minority by ploughing\r\nthe fifteen-acre lot and splitting from the tall walnut trees of the\r\nprimeval forest enough rails to surround the little clearing with a\r\nfence. Such was the meagre outfit of this coming leader of men, at the\r\nage when the future British Prime Minister or statesman emerges from the\r\nuniversity as a double first or senior wrangler, with every advantage\r\nthat high training and broad culture and association with the wisest and\r\nthe best of men and women can give, and enters upon some form of public\r\nservice on the road to usefulness and honor, the University course being\r\nonly the first stage of the public training. So Lincoln, at twenty-one,\r\nhad just begun his preparation for the public life to which he soon\r\nbegan to aspire. For some years yet he must continue to earn his daily\r\nbread by the sweat of his brow, having absolutely no means, no home,\r\nno friend to consult. More farm work as a hired hand, a clerkship in a\r\nvillage store, the running of a mill, another trip to New Orleans on a\r\nflatboat of his own contriving, a pilot’s berth on the river—these were\r\nthe means by which he subsisted until, in the summer of 1832, when he\r\nwas twenty-three years of age, an event occurred which gave him public\r\nrecognition.\r\n\r\nThe Black Hawk war broke out, and, the Governor of Illinois calling for\r\nvolunteers to repel the band of savages whose leader bore that name,\r\nLincoln enlisted and was elected captain by his comrades, among whom he\r\nhad already established his supremacy by signal feats of strength and\r\nmore than one successful single combat. During the brief hostilities\r\nhe was engaged in no battle and won no military glory, but his local\r\nleadership was established. The same year he offered himself as a\r\ncandidate for the Legislature of Illinois, but failed at the polls. Yet\r\nhis vast popularity with those who knew him was manifest. The district\r\nconsisted of several counties, but the unanimous vote of the people\r\nof his own county was for Lincoln. Another unsuccessful attempt at\r\nstore-keeping was followed by better luck at surveying, until his horse\r\nand instruments were levied upon under execution for the debts of his\r\nbusiness adventure.\r\n\r\nI have been thus detailed in sketching his early years because upon\r\nthese strange foundations the structure of his great fame and service\r\nwas built. In the place of a school and university training fortune\r\nsubstituted these trials, hardships, and struggles as a preparation for\r\nthe great work which he had to do. It turned out to be exactly what\r\nthe emergency required. Ten years instead at the public school and the\r\nuniversity certainly never could have fitted this man for the unique\r\nwork which was to be thrown upon him. Some other Moses would have had to\r\nlead us to our Jordan, to the sight of our promised land of liberty.\r\n\r\nAt the age of twenty-five he became a member of the Legislature of\r\nIllinois, and so continued for eight years, and, in the meantime,\r\nqualified himself by reading such law books as he could borrow at\r\nrandom—for he was too poor to buy any to be called to the Bar. For\r\nhis second quarter of a century—during which a single term in Congress\r\nintroduced him into the arena of national questions—he gave himself up\r\nto law and politics. In spite of his soaring ambition, his two years\r\nin Congress gave him no premonition of the great destiny that awaited\r\nhim,—and at its close, in 1849, we find him an unsuccessful applicant\r\nto the President for appointment as Commissioner of the General Land\r\nOffice—a purely administrative bureau; a fortunate escape for\r\nhimself and for his country. Year by year his knowledge and power, his\r\nexperience and reputation extended, and his mental faculties seemed to\r\ngrow by what they fed on. His power of persuasion, which had always been\r\nmarked, was developed to an extraordinary degree, now that he became\r\nengaged in congenial questions and subjects. Little by little he rose to\r\nprominence at the Bar, and became the most effective public speaker in\r\nthe West. Not that he possessed any of the graces of the orator; but his\r\nlogic was invincible, and his clearness and force of statement impressed\r\nupon his hearers the convictions of his honest mind, while his broad\r\nsympathies and sparkling and genial humor made him a universal favorite\r\nas far and as fast as his acquaintance extended.\r\n\r\nThese twenty years that elapsed from the time of his establishment as\r\na lawyer and legislator in Springfield, the new capital of Illinois,\r\nfurnished a fitting theatre for the development and display of his great\r\nfaculties, and, with his new and enlarged opportunities, he obviously\r\ngrew in mental stature in this second period of his career, as if\r\nto compensate for the absolute lack of advantages under which he had\r\nsuffered in youth. As his powers enlarged, his reputation extended,\r\nfor he was always before the people, felt a warm sympathy with all that\r\nconcerned them, took a zealous part in the discussion of every public\r\nquestion, and made his personal influence ever more widely and deeply\r\nfelt.\r\n\r\nMy brethren of the legal profession will naturally ask me, how could\r\nthis rough backwoodsman, whose youth had been spent in the forest or\r\non the farm and the flatboat, without culture or training, education or\r\nstudy, by the random reading, on the wing, of a few miscellaneous law\r\nbooks, become a learned and accomplished lawyer? Well, he never did.\r\nHe never would have earned his salt as a ‘Writer’ for the ‘Signet’,\r\nnor have won a place as advocate in the Court of Session, where the\r\ntechnique of the profession has reached its highest perfection, and\r\ncenturies of learning and precedent are involved in the equipment of a\r\nlawyer. Dr. Holmes, when asked by an anxious young mother, “When should\r\nthe education of a child begin?” replied, “Madam, at least two centuries\r\nbefore it is born!” and so I am sure it is with the Scots lawyer.\r\n\r\nBut not so in Illinois in 1840. Between 1830 and 1880 its population\r\nincreased twenty-fold, and when Lincoln began practising law in\r\nSpringfield in 1837, life in Illinois was very crude and simple, and so\r\nwere the courts and the administration of justice. Books and libraries\r\nwere scarce. But the people loved justice, upheld the law, and followed\r\nthe courts, and soon found their favorites among the advocates. The\r\nfundamental principles of the common law, as set forth by Blackstone\r\nand Chitty, were not so difficult to acquire; and brains, common sense,\r\nforce of character, tenacity of purpose, ready wit and power of speech\r\ndid the rest, and supplied all the deficiencies of learning.\r\n\r\nThe lawsuits of those days were extremely simple, and the principles of\r\nnatural justice were mainly relied on to dispose of them at the Bar\r\nand on the Bench, without resort to technical learning. Railroads,\r\ncorporations absorbing the chief business of the community, combined\r\nand inherited wealth, with all the subtle and intricate questions they\r\nbreed, had not yet come in—and so the professional agents and the\r\nequipment which they require were not needed. But there were many highly\r\neducated and powerful men at the Bar of Illinois, even in those early\r\ndays, whom the spirit of enterprise had carried there in search of fame\r\nand fortune. It was by constant contact and conflict with these that\r\nLincoln acquired professional strength and skill. Every community and\r\nevery age creates its own Bar, entirely adequate for its present uses\r\nand necessities. So in Illinois, as the population and wealth of the\r\nState kept on doubling and quadrupling, its Bar presented a growing\r\nabundance of learning and science and technical skill. The early\r\npractitioners grew with its growth and mastered the requisite knowledge.\r\nChicago soon grew to be one of the largest and richest and certainly\r\nthe most intensely active city on the continent, and if any of my\r\nprofessional friends here had gone there in Lincoln’s later years, to\r\ntry or argue a cause, or transact other business, with any idea that\r\nEdinburgh or London had a monopoly of legal learning, science, or\r\nsubtlety, they would certainly have found their mistake.\r\n\r\nIn those early days in the West, every lawyer, especially every court\r\nlawyer, was necessarily a politician, constantly engaged in the public\r\ndiscussion of the many questions evolved from the rapid development\r\nof town, county, State, and Federal affairs. Then and there, in this\r\nregard, public discussion supplied the place which the universal\r\nactivity of the press has since monopolized, and the public speaker who,\r\nby clearness, force, earnestness, and wit; could make himself felt on\r\nthe questions of the day would rapidly come to the front. In the absence\r\nof that immense variety of popular entertainments which now feed the\r\npublic taste and appetite, the people found their chief amusement in\r\nfrequenting the courts and public and political assemblies. In either\r\nplace, he who impressed, entertained, and amused them most was the\r\nhero of the hour. They did not discriminate very carefully between the\r\neloquence of the forum and the eloquence of the hustings. Human nature\r\nruled in both alike, and he who was the most effective speaker in a\r\npolitical harangue was often retained as most likely to win in a cause\r\nto be tried or argued. And I have no doubt in this way many retainers\r\ncame to Lincoln. Fees, money in any form, had no charms for him—in\r\nhis eager pursuit of fame he could not afford to make money. He was\r\nambitious to distinguish himself by some great service to mankind, and\r\nthis ambition for fame and real public service left no room for avarice\r\nin his composition. However much he earned, he seems to have ended every\r\nyear hardly richer than he began it, and yet, as the years passed,\r\nfees came to him freely. One of L 1,000 is recorded—a very large\r\nprofessional fee at that time, even in any part of America, the paradise\r\nof lawyers. I lay great stress on Lincoln’s career as a lawyer—much\r\nmore than his biographers do because in America a state of things\r\nexists wholly different from that which prevails in Great Britain. The\r\nprofession of the law always has been and is to this day the principal\r\navenue to public life; and I am sure that his training and experience\r\nin the courts had much to do with the development of those forces of\r\nintellect and character which he soon displayed on a broader arena.\r\n\r\nIt was in political controversy, of course, that he acquired his wide\r\nreputation, and made his deep and lasting impression upon the people of\r\nwhat had now become the powerful State of Illinois, and upon the people\r\nof the Great West, to whom the political power and control of the United\r\nStates were already surely and swiftly passing from the older Eastern\r\nStates. It was this reputation and this impression, and the familiar\r\nknowledge of his character which had come to them from his local\r\nleadership, that happily inspired the people of the West to present him\r\nas their candidate, and to press him upon the Republican convention of\r\n1860 as the fit and necessary leader in the struggle for life which was\r\nbefore the nation.\r\n\r\nThat struggle, as you all know, arose out of the terrible question of\r\nslavery—and I must trust to your general knowledge of the history\r\nof that question to make intelligible the attitude and leadership of\r\nLincoln as the champion of the hosts of freedom in the final contest.\r\nNegro slavery had been firmly established in the Southern States from\r\nan early period of their history. In 1619, the year before the Mayflower\r\nlanded our Pilgrim Fathers upon Plymouth Rock, a Dutch ship had\r\ndischarged a cargo of African slaves at Jamestown in Virginia: All\r\nthrough the colonial period their importation had continued. A few had\r\nfound their way into the Northern States, but none of them in sufficient\r\nnumbers to constitute danger or to afford a basis for political power.\r\nAt the time of the adoption of the Federal Constitution, there is no\r\ndoubt that the principal members of the convention not only condemned\r\nslavery as a moral, social, and political evil, but believed that by\r\nthe suppression of the slave trade it was in the course of gradual\r\nextinction in the South, as it certainly was in the North. Washington,\r\nin his will, provided for the emancipation of his own slaves, and\r\nsaid to Jefferson that it “was among his first wishes to see some plan\r\nadopted by which slavery in his country might be abolished.” Jefferson\r\nsaid, referring to the institution: “I tremble for my country when I\r\nthink that God is just; that His justice cannot sleep forever,”—and\r\nFranklin, Adams, Hamilton, and Patrick Henry were all utterly opposed\r\nto it. But it was made the subject of a fatal compromise in the Federal\r\nConstitution, whereby its existence was recognized in the States as a\r\nbasis of representation, the prohibition of the importation of slaves\r\nwas postponed for twenty years, and the return of fugitive slaves\r\nprovided for. But no imminent danger was apprehended from it till, by\r\nthe invention of the cotton gin in 1792, cotton culture by negro labor\r\nbecame at once and forever the leading industry of the South, and gave\r\na new impetus to the importation of slaves, so that in 1808, when\r\nthe constitutional prohibition took effect, their numbers had vastly\r\nincreased. From that time forward slavery became the basis of a great\r\npolitical power, and the Southern States, under all circumstances and at\r\nevery opportunity, carried on a brave and unrelenting struggle for its\r\nmaintenance and extension.\r\n\r\nThe conscience of the North was slow to rise against it, though bitter\r\ncontroversies from time to time took place. The Southern leaders\r\nthreatened disunion if their demands were not complied with. To save the\r\nUnion, compromise after compromise was made, but each one in the end was\r\nbroken. The Missouri Compromise, made in 1820 upon the occasion of\r\nthe admission of Missouri into the Union as a slave State, whereby, in\r\nconsideration of such admission, slavery was forever excluded from the\r\nNorthwest Territory, was ruthlessly repealed in 1854, by a Congress\r\nelected in the interests of the slave power, the intent being to force\r\nslavery into that vast territory which had so long been dedicated to\r\nfreedom. This challenge at last aroused the slumbering conscience and\r\npassion of the North, and led to the formation of the Republican party\r\nfor the avowed purpose of preventing, by constitutional methods, the\r\nfurther extension of slavery.\r\n\r\nIn its first campaign, in 1856, though it failed to elect its\r\ncandidates; it received a surprising vote and carried many of the\r\nStates. No one could any longer doubt that the North had made up its\r\nmind that no threats of disunion should deter it from pressing its\r\ncherished purpose and performing its long neglected duty. From the\r\noutset, Lincoln was one of the most active and effective leaders and\r\nspeakers of the new party, and the great debates between Lincoln and\r\nDouglas in 1858, as the respective champions of the restriction and\r\nextension of slavery, attracted the attention of the whole country.\r\nLincoln’s powerful arguments carried conviction everywhere. His moral\r\nnature was thoroughly aroused his conscience was stirred to the quick.\r\nUnless slavery was wrong, nothing was wrong. Was each man, of whatever\r\ncolor, entitled to the fruits of his own labor, or could one man live\r\nin idle luxury by the sweat of another’s brow, whose skin was darker?\r\nHe was an implicit believer in that principle of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence that all men are vested with certain inalienable rights\r\nthe equal rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. On this\r\ndoctrine he staked his case and carried it. We have time only for one or\r\ntwo sentences in which he struck the keynote of the contest.\r\n\r\n“The real issue in this country is the eternal struggle between these\r\ntwo principles—right and wrong—throughout the world. They are the two\r\nprinciples that have stood face to face from the beginning of time, and\r\nwill ever continue to struggle. The one is the common right of humanity,\r\nand the other the divine right of kings. It is the same principle in\r\nwhatever shape it develops itself. It is the same spirit that says, ‘You\r\nwork and toil and earn bread and I’ll eat it.’”\r\n\r\nHe foresaw with unerring vision that the conflict was inevitable and\r\nirrepressible—that one or the other, the right or the wrong, freedom\r\nor slavery, must ultimately prevail and wholly prevail, throughout the\r\ncountry; and this was the principle that carried the war, once begun, to\r\na finish.\r\n\r\nOne sentence of his is immortal:\r\n\r\n“Under the operation of the policy of compromise, the slavery agitation\r\nhas not only not ceased, but has constantly augmented. In my opinion\r\nit will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed. ‘A\r\nhouse divided against itself cannot stand.’ I believe this government\r\ncannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect\r\nthe Union to be dissolved. I do not expect the house to fall, but I do\r\nexpect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing or\r\nall the other; either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further\r\nspread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the\r\nbelief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction, or its advocates\r\nwill push it forward till it shall become alike lawful in all the\r\nStates, old as well as new, North as well as South.”\r\n\r\nDuring the entire decade from 1850 to 1860 the agitation of the\r\nslavery question was at the boiling point, and events which have become\r\nhistorical continually indicated the near approach of the overwhelming\r\nstorm. No sooner had the Compromise Acts of 1850 resulted in a temporary\r\npeace, which everybody said must be final and perpetual, than new\r\noutbreaks came. The forcible carrying away of fugitive slaves by Federal\r\ntroops from Boston agitated that ancient stronghold of freedom to its\r\nfoundations. The publication of Uncle Tom’s Cabin, which truly exposed\r\nthe frightful possibilities of the slave system; the reckless attempts\r\nby force and fraud to establish it in Kansas against the will of the\r\nvast majority of the settlers; the beating of Summer in the Senate\r\nChamber for words spoken in debate; the Dred Scott decision in the\r\nSupreme Court, which made the nation realize that the slave power had at\r\nlast reached the fountain of Federal justice; and finally the execution\r\nof John Brown, for his wild raid into Virginia, to invite the slaves to\r\nrally to the standard of freedom which he unfurled:—all these events\r\ntend to illustrate and confirm Lincoln’s contention that the nation\r\ncould not permanently continue half slave and half free, but must become\r\nall one thing or all the other. When John Brown lay under sentence of\r\ndeath he declared that now he was sure that slavery must be wiped out in\r\nblood; but neither he nor his executioners dreamt that within four years\r\na million soldiers would be marching across the country for its final\r\nextirpation, to the music of the war-song of the great conflict:\r\n\r\n   “John Brown’s body lies a-mouldering in the grave,\r\n   But his soul is marching on.”\r\n\r\nAnd now, at the age of fifty-one, this child of the wilderness, this\r\nfarm laborer, rail-sputter, flatboatman, this surveyor, lawyer, orator,\r\nstatesman, and patriot, found himself elected by the great party which\r\nwas pledged to prevent at all hazards the further extension of slavery,\r\nas the chief magistrate of the Republic, bound to carry out that\r\npurpose, to be the leader and ruler of the nation in its most trying\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nThose who believe that there is a living Providence that overrules and\r\nconducts the affairs of nations, find in the elevation of this plain man\r\nto this extraordinary fortune and to this great duty, which he so\r\nfitly discharged, a signal vindication of their faith. Perhaps to this\r\nphilosophical institution the judgment of our philosopher Emerson will\r\ncommend itself as a just estimate of Lincoln’s historical place.\r\n\r\n“His occupying the chair of state was a triumph of the good sense of\r\nmankind and of the public conscience. He grew according to the need; his\r\nmind mastered the problem of the day: and as the problem grew, so did\r\nhis comprehension of it. In the war there was no place for holiday\r\nmagistrate, nor fair-weather sailor. The new pilot was hurried to\r\nthe helm in a tornado. In four years—four years of battle days—his\r\nendurance, his fertility of resource, his magnanimity, were sorely\r\ntried, and never found wanting. There, by his courage, his justice, his\r\neven temper, his fertile counsel, his humanity, he stood a heroic figure\r\nin the centre of a heroic epoch. He is the true history of the American\r\npeople in his time, the true representative of this continent—father\r\nof his country, the pulse of twenty millions throbbing in his heart, the\r\nthought of their mind—articulated in his tongue.”\r\n\r\nHe was born great, as distinguished from those who achieve greatness or\r\nhave it thrust upon them, and his inherent capacity, mental, moral, and\r\nphysical, having been recognized by the educated intelligence of a free\r\npeople, they happily chose him for their ruler in a day of deadly peril.\r\n\r\nIt is now forty years since I first saw and heard Abraham Lincoln, but\r\nthe impression which he left on my mind is ineffaceable. After his great\r\nsuccesses in the West he came to New York to make a political address.\r\nHe appeared in every sense of the word like one of the plain people\r\namong whom he loved to be counted. At first sight there was nothing\r\nimpressive or imposing about him—except that his great stature singled\r\nhim out from the crowd: his clothes hung awkwardly on his giant frame;\r\nhis face was of a dark pallor, without the slightest tinge of color; his\r\nseamed and rugged features bore the furrows of hardship and struggle;\r\nhis deep-set eyes looked sad and anxious; his countenance in repose gave\r\nlittle evidence of that brain power which had raised him from the lowest\r\nto the highest station among his countrymen; as he talked to me before\r\nthe meeting, he seemed ill at ease, with that sort of apprehension which\r\na young man might feel before presenting himself to a new and strange\r\naudience, whose critical disposition he dreaded. It was a great\r\naudience, including all the noted men—all the learned and cultured of\r\nhis party in New York editors, clergymen, statesmen, lawyers, merchants,\r\ncritics. They were all very curious to hear him. His fame as a powerful\r\nspeaker had preceded him, and exaggerated rumor of his wit—the worst\r\nforerunner of an orator—had reached the East. When Mr. Bryant presented\r\nhim, on the high platform of the Cooper Institute, a vast sea of eager\r\nupturned faces greeted him, full of intense curiosity to see what this\r\nrude child of the people was like. He was equal to the occasion. When\r\nhe spoke he was transformed; his eye kindled, his voice rang, his face\r\nshone and seemed to light up the whole assembly. For an hour and a half\r\nhe held his audience in the hollow of his hand. His style of speech and\r\nmanner of delivery were severely simple. What Lowell called “the\r\ngrand simplicities of the Bible,” with which he was so familiar, were\r\nreflected in his discourse. With no attempt at ornament or rhetoric,\r\nwithout parade or pretence, he spoke straight to the point. If any came\r\nexpecting the turgid eloquence or the ribaldry of the frontier, they\r\nmust have been startled at the earnest and sincere purity of his\r\nutterances. It was marvellous to see how this untutored man, by mere\r\nself-discipline and the chastening of his own spirit, had outgrown all\r\nmeretricious arts, and found his own way to the grandeur and strength of\r\nabsolute simplicity.\r\n\r\nHe spoke upon the theme which he had mastered so thoroughly. He\r\ndemonstrated by copious historical proofs and masterly logic that the\r\nfathers who created the Constitution in order to form a more perfect\r\nunion, to establish justice, and to secure the blessings of liberty\r\nto themselves and their posterity, intended to empower the Federal\r\nGovernment to exclude slavery from the Territories. In the kindliest\r\nspirit he protested against the avowed threat of the Southern States to\r\ndestroy the Union if, in order to secure freedom in those vast regions\r\nout of which future States were to be carved, a Republican President\r\nwere elected. He closed with an appeal to his audience, spoken with all\r\nthe fire of his aroused and kindling conscience, with a full outpouring\r\nof his love of justice and liberty, to maintain their political purpose\r\non that lofty and unassailable issue of right and wrong which alone\r\ncould justify it, and not to be intimidated from their high resolve and\r\nsacred duty by any threats of destruction to the government or of ruin\r\nto themselves. He concluded with this telling sentence, which drove the\r\nwhole argument home to all our hearts: “Let us have faith that right\r\nmakes might, and in that faith let us to the end dare to do our duty as\r\nwe understand it.” That night the great hall, and the next day the whole\r\ncity, rang with delighted applause and congratulations, and he who had\r\ncome as a stranger departed with the laurels of great triumph.\r\n\r\nAlas! in five years from that exulting night I saw him again, for the\r\nlast time, in the same city, borne in his coffin through its draped\r\nstreets. With tears and lamentations a heart-broken people accompanied\r\nhim from Washington, the scene of his martyrdom, to his last\r\nresting-place in the young city of the West where he had worked his way\r\nto fame.\r\n\r\nNever was a new ruler in a more desperate plight than Lincoln when\r\nhe entered office on the fourth of March, 1861, four months after his\r\nelection, and took his oath to support the Constitution and the Union.\r\nThe intervening time had been busily employed by the Southern States in\r\ncarrying out their threat of disunion in the event of his election.\r\nAs soon as the fact was ascertained, seven of them had seceded and had\r\nseized upon the forts, arsenals, navy yards, and other public property\r\nof the United States within their boundaries, and were making every\r\npreparation for war. In the meantime the retiring President, who had\r\nbeen elected by the slave power, and who thought the seceding States\r\ncould not lawfully be coerced, had done absolutely nothing. Lincoln\r\nfound himself, by the Constitution, Commander-in-Chief of the Army and\r\nNavy of the United States, but with only a remnant of either at hand.\r\nEach was to be created on a great scale out of the unknown resources of\r\na nation untried in war.\r\n\r\nIn his mild and conciliatory inaugural address, while appealing to the\r\nseceding States to return to their allegiance, he avowed his purpose to\r\nkeep the solemn oath he had taken that day, to see that the laws of the\r\nUnion were faithfully executed, and to use the troops to recover the\r\nforts, navy yards, and other property belonging to the government. It\r\nis probable, however, that neither side actually realized that war\r\nwas inevitable, and that the other was determined to fight, until the\r\nassault on Fort Sumter presented the South as the first aggressor\r\nand roused the North to use every possible resource to maintain the\r\ngovernment and the imperilled Union, and to vindicate the supremacy of\r\nthe flag over every inch of the territory of the United States. The\r\nfact that Lincoln’s first proclamation called for only 75,000 troops, to\r\nserve for three months, shows how inadequate was even his idea of what\r\nthe future had in store. But from that moment Lincoln and his loyal\r\nsupporters never faltered in their purpose. They knew they could win,\r\nthat it was their duty to win, and that for America the whole hope\r\nof the future depended upon their winning; for now by the acts of the\r\nseceding States the issue of the election to secure or prevent the\r\nextension of slavery—stood transformed into a struggle to preserve or\r\nto destroy the Union.\r\n\r\nWe cannot follow this contest. You know its gigantic proportions; that\r\nit lasted four years instead of three months; that in its progress,\r\ninstead of 75,000 men, more than 2,000,000 were enrolled on the side\r\nof the government alone; that the aggregate cost and loss to the nation\r\napproximated to 1,000,000,000 pounds sterling, and that not less than\r\n300,000 brave and precious lives were sacrificed on each side. History\r\nhas recorded how Lincoln bore himself during these four frightful years;\r\nthat he was the real President, the responsible and actual head of the\r\ngovernment, through it all; that he listened to all advice, heard all\r\nparties, and then, always realizing his responsibility to God and the\r\nnation, decided every great executive question for himself. His absolute\r\nhonesty had become proverbial long before he was President. “Honest Abe\r\nLincoln” was the name by which he had been known for years. His every\r\nact attested it.\r\n\r\nIn all the grandeur of the vast power that he wielded, he never ceased\r\nto be one of the plain people, as he always called them, never lost or\r\nimpaired his perfect sympathy with them, was always in perfect touch\r\nwith them and open to their appeals; and here lay the very secret of\r\nhis personality and of his power, for the people in turn gave him their\r\nabsolute confidence. His courage, his fortitude, his patience, his\r\nhopefulness, were sorely tried but never exhausted.\r\n\r\nHe was true as steel to his generals, but had frequent occasion to\r\nchange them, as he found them inadequate. This serious and painful duty\r\nrested wholly upon him, and was perhaps his most important function as\r\nCommander-in-Chief; but when, at last, he recognized in General Grant\r\nthe master of the situation, the man who could and would bring the war\r\nto a triumphant end, he gave it all over to him and upheld him with all\r\nhis might. Amid all the pressure and distress that the burdens of office\r\nbrought upon him, his unfailing sense of humor saved him; probably it\r\nmade it possible for him to live under the burden. He had always been\r\nthe great story-teller of the West, and he used and cultivated this\r\nfaculty to relieve the weight of the load he bore.\r\n\r\nIt enabled him to keep the wonderful record of never having lost his\r\ntemper, no matter what agony he had to bear. A whole night might be\r\nspent in recounting the stories of his wit, humor, and harmless sarcasm.\r\nBut I will recall only two of his sayings, both about General Grant, who\r\nalways found plenty of enemies and critics to urge the President to oust\r\nhim from his command. One, I am sure, will interest all Scotchmen. They\r\nrepeated with malicious intent the gossip that Grant drank. “What\r\ndoes he drink?” asked Lincoln. “Whiskey,” was, of course, the answer;\r\ndoubtless you can guess the brand. “Well,” said the President, “just\r\nfind out what particular kind he uses and I’ll send a barrel to each of\r\nmy other generals.” The other must be as pleasing to the British as\r\nto the American ear. When pressed again on other grounds to get rid of\r\nGrant, he declared, “I can’t spare that man, he fights!”\r\n\r\nHe was tender-hearted to a fault, and never could resist the appeals of\r\nwives and mothers of soldiers who had got into trouble and were under\r\nsentence of death for their offences. His Secretary of War and other\r\nofficials complained that they never could get deserters shot. As surely\r\nas the women of the culprit’s family could get at him he always gave\r\nway. Certainly you will all appreciate his exquisite sympathy with the\r\nsuffering relatives of those who had fallen in battle. His heart bled\r\nwith theirs. Never was there a more gentle and tender utterance than his\r\nletter to a mother who had given all her sons to her country, written at\r\na time when the angel of death had visited almost every household in the\r\nland, and was already hovering over him.\r\n\r\n“I have been shown,” he says, “in the files of the War Department a\r\nstatement that you are the mother of five sons who have died gloriously\r\non the field of battle. I feel how weak and fruitless must be any words\r\nof mine which should attempt to beguile you from your grief for a\r\nloss so overwhelming but I cannot refrain from tendering to you the\r\nconsolation which may be found in the thanks of the Republic they died\r\nto save. I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your\r\nbereavement and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and the\r\nlost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a\r\nsacrifice upon the altar of freedom.”\r\n\r\nHardly could your illustrious sovereign, from the depths of her queenly\r\nand womanly heart, have spoken words more touching and tender to soothe\r\nthe stricken mothers of her own soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe Emancipation Proclamation, with which Mr. Lincoln delighted the\r\ncountry and the world on the first of January, 1863, will doubtless\r\nsecure for him a foremost place in history among the philanthropists\r\nand benefactors of the race, as it rescued, from hopeless and degrading\r\nslavery, so many millions of his fellow-beings described in the law and\r\nexisting in fact as “chattels-personal, in the hands of their owners\r\nand possessors, to all intents, constructions, and purposes whatsoever.”\r\nRarely does the happy fortune come to one man to render such a service\r\nto his kind—to proclaim liberty throughout the land unto all the\r\ninhabitants thereof.\r\n\r\nIdeas rule the world, and never was there a more signal instance of this\r\ntriumph of an idea than here. William Lloyd Garrison, who thirty years\r\nbefore had begun his crusade for the abolition of slavery, and had lived\r\nto see this glorious and unexpected consummation of the hopeless cause\r\nto which he had devoted his life, well described the proclamation as\r\na “great historic event, sublime in its magnitude, momentous and\r\nbeneficent in its far-reaching consequences, and eminently just and\r\nright alike to the oppressor and the oppressed.”\r\n\r\nLincoln had always been heart and soul opposed to slavery. Tradition\r\nsays that on the trip on the flatboat to New Orleans he formed his\r\nfirst and last opinion of slavery at the sight of negroes chained and\r\nscourged, and that then and there the iron entered into his soul. No\r\nboy could grow to manhood in those days as a poor white in Kentucky and\r\nIndiana, in close contact with slavery or in its neighborhood, without a\r\ngrowing consciousness of its blighting effects on free labor, as well as\r\nof its frightful injustice and cruelty. In the Legislature of Illinois,\r\nwhere the public sentiment was all for upholding the institution and\r\nviolently against every movement for its abolition or restriction, upon\r\nthe passage of resolutions to that effect he had the courage with one\r\ncompanion to put on record his protest, “believing that the institution\r\nof slavery is founded both in injustice and bad policy.” No great\r\ndemonstration of courage, you will say; but that was at a time when\r\nGarrison, for his abolition utterances, had been dragged by an angry mob\r\nthrough the streets of Boston with a rope around his body, and in\r\nthe very year that Lovejoy in the same State of Illinois was slain by\r\nrioters while defending his press, from which he had printed antislavery\r\nappeals.\r\n\r\nIn Congress he brought in a bill for gradual abolition in the District\r\nof Columbia, with compensation to the owners, for until they raised\r\ntreasonable hands against the life of the nation he always maintained\r\nthat the property of the slaveholders, into which they had come by two\r\ncenturies of descent, without fault on their part, ought not to be taken\r\naway from them without just compensation. He used to say that, one way\r\nor another, he had voted forty-two times for the Wilmot Proviso, which\r\nMr. Wilmot of Pennsylvania moved as an addition to every bill which\r\naffected United States territory, “that neither slavery nor involuntary\r\nservitude shall ever exist in any part of the said territory,” and it is\r\nevident that his condemnation of the system, on moral grounds as a crime\r\nagainst the human race, and on political grounds as a cancer that was\r\nsapping the vitals of the nation, and must master its whole being or\r\nbe itself extirpated, grew steadily upon him until it culminated in his\r\ngreat speeches in the Illinois debate.\r\n\r\nBy the mere election of Lincoln to the Presidency, the further extension\r\nof slavery into the Territories was rendered forever impossible—Vox\r\npopuli, vox Dei. Revolutions never go backward, and when founded on a\r\ngreat moral sentiment stirring the heart of an indignant people their\r\nedicts are irresistible and final. Had the slave power acquiesced in\r\nthat election, had the Southern States remained under the Constitution\r\nand within the Union, and relied upon their constitutional and legal\r\nrights, their favorite institution, immoral as it was, blighting and\r\nfatal as it was, might have endured for another century. The great party\r\nthat had elected him, unalterably determined against its extension, was\r\nnevertheless pledged not to interfere with its continuance in the States\r\nwhere it already existed. Of course, when new regions were forever\r\nclosed against it, from its very nature it must have begun to shrink\r\nand to dwindle; and probably gradual and compensated emancipation,\r\nwhich appealed very strongly to the new President’s sense of justice and\r\nexpediency, would, in the progress of time, by a reversion to the ideas\r\nof the founders of the Republic, have found a safe outlet for both\r\nmasters and slaves. But whom the gods wish to destroy they first make\r\nmad, and when seven States, afterwards increased to eleven, openly\r\nseceded from the Union, when they declared and began the war upon the\r\nnation, and challenged its mighty power to the desperate and protracted\r\nstruggle for its life, and for the maintenance of its authority as\r\na nation over its territory, they gave to Lincoln and to freedom the\r\nsublime opportunity of history.\r\n\r\nIn his first inaugural address, when as yet not a drop of precious blood\r\nhad been shed, while he held out to them the olive branch in one hand,\r\nin the other he presented the guarantees of the Constitution, and after\r\nreciting the emphatic resolution of the convention that nominated\r\nhim, that the maintenance inviolate of the “rights of the States, and\r\nespecially the right of each State to order and control its own domestic\r\ninstitutions according to its own judgment exclusively, is essential\r\nto that balance of power on which the perfection and endurance of our\r\npolitical fabric depend,” he reiterated this sentiment, and declared,\r\nwith no mental reservation, “that all the protection which, consistently\r\nwith the Constitution and the laws, can be given, will be cheerfully\r\ngiven to all the States when lawfully demanded for whatever cause as\r\ncheerfully to one section as to another.”\r\n\r\nWhen, however, these magnanimous overtures for peace and reunion were\r\nrejected; when the seceding States defied the Constitution and every\r\nclause and principle of it; when they persisted in staying out of the\r\nUnion from which they had seceded, and proceeded to carve out of its\r\nterritory a new and hostile empire based on slavery; when they flew at\r\nthe throat of the nation and plunged it into the bloodiest war of the\r\nnineteenth century the tables were turned, and the belief gradually came\r\nto the mind of the President that if the Rebellion was not soon subdued\r\nby force of arms, if the war must be fought out to the bitter end, then\r\nto reach that end the salvation of the nation itself might require\r\nthe destruction of slavery wherever it existed; that if the war was to\r\ncontinue on one side for Disunion, for no other purpose than to preserve\r\nslavery, it must continue on the other side for the Union, to destroy\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\nAs he said, “Events control me; I cannot control events,” and as the\r\ndreadful war progressed and became more deadly and dangerous, the\r\nunalterable conviction was forced upon him that, in order that the\r\nfrightful sacrifice of life and treasure on both sides might not be all\r\nin vain, it had become his duty as Commander-in-Chief of the Army, as\r\na necessary war measure, to strike a blow at the Rebellion which,\r\nall others failing, would inevitably lead to its annihilation, by\r\nannihilating the very thing for which it was contending. His own words\r\nare the best:\r\n\r\n“I understood that my oath to preserve the Constitution to the best of\r\nmy ability imposed upon me the duty of preserving by every indispensable\r\nmeans that government—that nation—of which that Constitution was the\r\norganic law. Was it possible to lose the nation and yet preserve the\r\nConstitution? By general law, life and limb must be protected, yet often\r\na limb must be amputated to save a life; but a life is never wisely\r\ngiven to save a limb. I felt that measures otherwise unconstitutional\r\nmight become lawful by becoming indispensable to the preservation of the\r\nConstitution through the preservation of the nation. Right or wrong, I\r\nassumed this ground and now avow it. I could not feel that to the best\r\nof my ability I had ever tried to preserve the Constitution if to save\r\nslavery or any minor matter I should permit the wreck of government,\r\ncountry, and Constitution all together.”\r\n\r\nAnd so, at last, when in his judgment the indispensable necessity had\r\ncome, he struck the fatal blow, and signed the proclamation which has\r\nmade his name immortal. By it, the President, as Commander-in-Chief in\r\ntime of actual armed rebellion, and as a fit and necessary war measure\r\nfor suppressing the rebellion, proclaimed all persons held as slaves\r\nin the States and parts of States then in rebellion to be thenceforward\r\nfree, and declared that the executive, with the army and navy, would\r\nrecognize and maintain their freedom.\r\n\r\nIn the other great steps of the government, which led to the triumphant\r\nprosecution of the war, he necessarily shared the responsibility and the\r\ncredit with the great statesmen who stayed up his hands in his cabinet,\r\nwith Seward, Chase and Stanton, and the rest,—and with his generals and\r\nadmirals, his soldiers and sailors, but this great act was absolutely\r\nhis own. The conception and execution were exclusively his. He laid it\r\nbefore his cabinet as a measure on which his mind was made up and could\r\nnot be changed, asking them only for suggestions as to details. He chose\r\nthe time and the circumstances under which the Emancipation should be\r\nproclaimed and when it should take effect.\r\n\r\nIt came not an hour too soon; but public opinion in the North would not\r\nhave sustained it earlier. In the first eighteen months of the war its\r\nravages had extended from the Atlantic to beyond the Mississippi. Many\r\nvictories in the West had been balanced and paralyzed by inaction\r\nand disasters in Virginia, only partially redeemed by the bloody and\r\nindecisive battle of Antietam; a reaction had set in from the general\r\nenthusiasm which had swept the Northern States after the assault upon\r\nSumter. It could not truly be said that they had lost heart, but faction\r\nwas raising its head. Heard through the land like the blast of a\r\nbugle, the proclamation rallied the patriotism of the country to fresh\r\nsacrifices and renewed ardor. It was a step that could not be revoked.\r\nIt relieved the conscience of the nation from an incubus that had\r\noppressed it from its birth. The United States were rescued from the\r\nfalse predicament in which they had been from the beginning, and the\r\ngreat popular heart leaped with new enthusiasm for “Liberty and Union,\r\nhenceforth and forever, one and inseparable.” It brought not only moral\r\nbut material support to the cause of the government, for within two\r\nyears 120,000 colored troops were enlisted in the military service and\r\nfollowing the national flag, supported by all the loyalty of the North,\r\nand led by its choicest spirits. One mother said, when her son was\r\noffered the command of the first colored regiment, “If he accepts it\r\nI shall be as proud as if I had heard that he was shot.” He was shot\r\nheading a gallant charge of his regiment.... The Confederates replied to\r\na request of his friends for his body that they had “buried him under a\r\nlayer of his niggers...;” but that mother has lived to enjoy thirty-six\r\nyears of his glory, and Boston has erected its noblest monument to his\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the proclamation upon the actual progress of the war was\r\nnot immediate, but wherever the Federal armies advanced they carried\r\nfreedom with them, and when the summer came round the new spirit and\r\nforce which had animated the heart of the government and people were\r\nmanifest. In the first week of July the decisive battle of Gettysburg\r\nturned the tide of war, and the fall of Vicksburg made the great river\r\nfree from its source to the Gulf.\r\n\r\nOn foreign nations the influence of the proclamation and of these new\r\nvictories was of great importance. In those days, when there was no\r\ncable, it was not easy for foreign observers to appreciate what was\r\nreally going on; they could not see clearly the true state of affairs,\r\nas in the last year of the nineteenth century we have been able, by our\r\nnew electric vision, to watch every event at the antipodes and observe\r\nits effect. The Rebel emissaries, sent over to solicit intervention,\r\nspared no pains to impress upon the minds of public and private men\r\nand upon the press their own views of the character of the contest. The\r\nprospects of the Confederacy were always better abroad than at home. The\r\nstock markets of the world gambled upon its chances, and its bonds at\r\none time were high in favor.\r\n\r\nSuch ideas as these were seriously held: that the North was fighting for\r\nempire and the South for independence; that the Southern States, instead\r\nof being the grossest oligarchies, essentially despotisms, founded on\r\nthe right of one man to appropriate the fruit of other men’s toil and to\r\nexclude them from equal rights, were real republics, feebler to be sure\r\nthan their Northern rivals, but representing the same idea of freedom,\r\nand that the mighty strength of the nation was being put forth to\r\ncrush them; that Jefferson Davis and the Southern leaders had created\r\na nation; that the republican experiment had failed and the Union had\r\nceased to exist. But the crowning argument to foreign minds was that\r\nit was an utter impossibility for the government to win in the contest;\r\nthat the success of the Southern States, so far as separation was\r\nconcerned, was as certain as any event yet future and contingent could\r\nbe; that the subjugation of the South by the North, even if it could be\r\naccomplished, would prove a calamity to the United States and the world,\r\nand especially calamitous to the negro race; and that such a victory\r\nwould necessarily leave the people of the South for many generations\r\ncherishing deadly hostility against the government and the North, and\r\nplotting always to recover their independence.\r\n\r\nWhen Lincoln issued his proclamation he knew that all these ideas were\r\nfounded in error; that the national resources were inexhaustible;\r\nthat the government could and would win, and that if slavery were once\r\nfinally disposed of, the only cause of difference being out of the way,\r\nthe North and South would come together again, and by and by be as good\r\nfriends as ever. In many quarters abroad the proclamation was\r\nwelcomed with enthusiasm by the friends of America; but I think the\r\ndemonstrations in its favor that brought more gladness to Lincoln’s\r\nheart than any other were the meetings held in the manufacturing\r\ncentres, by the very operatives upon whom the war bore the hardest,\r\nexpressing the most enthusiastic sympathy with the proclamation, while\r\nthey bore with heroic fortitude the grievous privations which the war\r\nentailed upon them. Mr. Lincoln’s expectation when he announced to the\r\nworld that all slaves in all States then in rebellion were set free\r\nmust have been that the avowed position of his government, that the\r\ncontinuance of the war now meant the annihilation of slavery, would make\r\nintervention impossible for any foreign nation whose people were lovers\r\nof liberty—and so the result proved.\r\n\r\nThe growth and development of Lincoln’s mental power and moral force, of\r\nhis intense and magnetic personality, after the vast responsibilities of\r\ngovernment were thrown upon him at the age of fifty-two, furnish a rare\r\nand striking illustration of the marvellous capacity and adaptability of\r\nthe human intellect—of the sound mind in the sound body. He came to\r\nthe discharge of the great duties of the Presidency with absolutely no\r\nexperience in the administration of government, or of the vastly\r\nvaried and complicated questions of foreign and domestic policy which\r\nimmediately arose, and continued to press upon him during the rest of\r\nhis life; but he mastered each as it came, apparently with the facility\r\nof a trained and experienced ruler. As Clarendon said of Cromwell, “His\r\nparts seemed to be raised by the demands of great station.” His life\r\nthrough it all was one of intense labor, anxiety, and distress, without\r\none hour of peaceful repose from first to last. But he rose to every\r\noccasion. He led public opinion, but did not march so far in advance of\r\nit as to fail of its effective support in every great emergency. He\r\nknew the heart and thought of the people, as no man not in constant and\r\nabsolute sympathy with them could have known it, and so holding their\r\nconfidence, he triumphed through and with them. Not only was there this\r\nsteady growth of intellect, but the infinite delicacy of his nature and\r\nits capacity for refinement developed also, as exhibited in the\r\npurity and perfection of his language and style of speech. The rough\r\nbackwoodsman, who had never seen the inside of a university, became in\r\nthe end, by self-training and the exercise of his own powers of mind,\r\nheart, and soul, a master of style, and some of his utterances will rank\r\nwith the best, the most perfectly adapted to the occasion which produced\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHave you time to listen to his two-minutes speech at Gettysburg, at the\r\ndedication of the Soldiers’ Cemetery? His whole soul was in it:\r\n\r\n“Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this\r\ncontinent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the\r\nproposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a\r\ngreat civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived\r\nand so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of\r\nthat war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final\r\nresting-place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might\r\nlive. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But\r\nin a larger sense we cannot dedicate—we cannot consecrate—we cannot\r\nhallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here\r\nhave consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. The\r\nworld will little note, nor long remember, what we say here but it can\r\nnever forget what they did here. It is for us, the living, rather, to\r\nbe dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have\r\nthus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to\r\nthe great task remaining before us that from these honored dead we\r\ntake increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full\r\nmeasure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall\r\nnot have died in vain—that this nation under God shall have a new birth\r\nof freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, and for\r\nthe people shall not perish from the earth.”\r\n\r\nHe lived to see his work indorsed by an overwhelming majority of his\r\ncountrymen. In his second inaugural address, pronounced just forty days\r\nbefore his death, there is a single passage which well displays his\r\nindomitable will and at the same time his deep religious feeling,\r\nhis sublime charity to the enemies of his country, and his broad and\r\ncatholic humanity:\r\n\r\n“If we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offences\r\nwhich in the Providence of God must needs come, but which, having\r\ncontinued through the appointed time, He now wills to remove, and that\r\nHe gives to both North and South this terrible war, as the woe due to\r\nthose by whom the offence came, shall we discern therein any departure\r\nfrom those divine attributes which the believers in a living God always\r\nascribe to Him? Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this\r\nmighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it\r\ncontinue until all the wealth piled by the bondsmen’s two hundred and\r\nfifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of\r\nblood drawn with the lash shall be paid with another drawn by the sword,\r\nas was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said, ‘the\r\njudgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.’\r\n\r\n“With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the\r\nright as God gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the\r\nwork we are in to bind up the nation’s wounds; to care for him who shall\r\nhave borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan to do all which\r\nmay achieve, and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves, and\r\nwith all nations.”\r\n\r\nHis prayer was answered. The forty days of life that remained to\r\nhim were crowned with great historic events. He lived to see\r\nhis Proclamation of Emancipation embodied in an amendment of the\r\nConstitution, adopted by Congress, and submitted to the States for\r\nratification. The mighty scourge of war did speedily pass away, for it\r\nwas given him to witness the surrender of the Rebel army and the fall of\r\ntheir capital, and the starry flag that he loved waving in triumph over\r\nthe national soil. When he died by the madman’s hand in the supreme hour\r\nof victory, the vanquished lost their best friend, and the human race\r\none of its noblest examples; and all the friends of freedom and justice,\r\nin whose cause he lived and died, joined hands as mourners at his grave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WRITINGS OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN, 1832–1843\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1832\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE OF SANGAMON COUNTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch 9, 1832.\r\n\r\nFELLOW CITIZENS:—Having become a candidate for the honorable office of\r\none of your Representatives in the next General Assembly of this State,\r\nin according with an established custom and the principles of true\r\nRepublicanism it becomes my duty to make known to you, the people whom I\r\npropose to represent, my sentiments with regard to local affairs.\r\n\r\nTime and experience have verified to a demonstration the public utility\r\nof internal improvements. That the poorest and most thinly populated\r\ncountries would be greatly benefited by the opening of good roads, and\r\nin the clearing of navigable streams within their limits, is what no\r\nperson will deny. Yet it is folly to undertake works of this or\r\nany other without first knowing that we are able to finish them—as\r\nhalf-finished work generally proves to be labor lost. There cannot\r\njustly be any objection to having railroads and canals, any more than to\r\nother good things, provided they cost nothing. The only objection is to\r\npaying for them; and the objection arises from the want of ability to\r\npay.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the County of Sangamon, some....\r\n\r\nYet, however desirable an object the construction of a railroad through\r\nour country may be, however high our imaginations may be heated at\r\nthoughts of it,—there is always a heart-appalling shock accompanying\r\nthe amount of its cost, which forces us to shrink from our pleasing\r\nanticipations. The probable cost of this contemplated railroad is\r\nestimated at $290,000; the bare statement of which, in my opinion, is\r\nsufficient to justify the belief that the improvement of the Sangamon\r\nRiver is an object much better suited to our infant resources.......\r\n\r\nWhat the cost of this work would be, I am unable to say. It is probable,\r\nhowever, that it would not be greater than is common to streams of the\r\nsame length. Finally, I believe the improvement of the Sangamon River\r\nto be vastly important and highly desirable to the people of the county;\r\nand, if elected, any measure in the Legislature having this for its\r\nobject, which may appear judicious, will meet my approbation and receive\r\nmy support.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the practice of loaning money at exorbitant rates of\r\ninterest has already been opened as a field for discussion; so I suppose\r\nI may enter upon it without claiming the honor or risking the danger\r\nwhich may await its first explorer. It seems as though we are never\r\nto have an end to this baneful and corroding system, acting almost as\r\nprejudicially to the general interests of the community as a direct tax\r\nof several thousand dollars annually laid on each county for the benefit\r\nof a few individuals only, unless there be a law made fixing the limits\r\nof usury. A law for this purpose, I am of opinion, may be made without\r\nmaterially injuring any class of people. In cases of extreme necessity,\r\nthere could always be means found to cheat the law; while in all other\r\ncases it would have its intended effect. I would favor the passage of\r\na law on this subject which might not be very easily evaded. Let it be\r\nsuch that the labor and difficulty of evading it could only be justified\r\nin cases of greatest necessity.\r\n\r\nUpon the subject of education, not presuming to dictate any plan\r\nor system respecting it, I can only say that I view it as the most\r\nimportant subject which we as a people can be engaged in. That every\r\nman may receive at least a moderate education, and thereby be enabled to\r\nread the histories of his own and other countries, by which he may duly\r\nappreciate the value of our free institutions, appears to be an object\r\nof vital importance, even on this account alone, to say nothing of the\r\nadvantages and satisfaction to be derived from all being able to read\r\nthe Scriptures, and other works both of a religious and moral nature,\r\nfor themselves.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I desire to see the time when education—and by its means,\r\nmorality, sobriety, enterprise, and industry—shall become much more\r\ngeneral than at present, and should be gratified to have it in my power\r\nto contribute something to the advancement of any measure which might\r\nhave a tendency to accelerate that happy period.\r\n\r\nWith regard to existing laws, some alterations are thought to be\r\nnecessary. Many respectable men have suggested that our estray laws, the\r\nlaw respecting the issuing of executions, the road law, and some others,\r\nare deficient in their present form, and require alterations. But,\r\nconsidering the great probability that the framers of those laws were\r\nwiser than myself, I should prefer not meddling with them, unless they\r\nwere first attacked by others; in which case I should feel it both a\r\nprivilege and a duty to take that stand which, in my view, might tend\r\nmost to the advancement of justice.\r\n\r\nBut, fellow-citizens, I shall conclude. Considering the great degree of\r\nmodesty which should always attend youth, it is probable I have already\r\nbeen more presuming than becomes me. However, upon the subjects of\r\nwhich I have treated, I have spoken as I have thought. I may be wrong in\r\nregard to any or all of them; but, holding it a sound maxim that it is\r\nbetter only sometimes to be right than at all times to be wrong, so soon\r\nas I discover my opinions to be erroneous, I shall be ready to renounce\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nEvery man is said to have his peculiar ambition. Whether it be true or\r\nnot, I can say, for one, that I have no other so great as that of being\r\ntruly esteemed of my fellow-men, by rendering myself worthy of their\r\nesteem. How far I shall succeed in gratifying this ambition is yet to be\r\ndeveloped. I am young, and unknown to many of you. I was born, and have\r\never remained, in the most humble walks of life. I have no wealthy\r\nor popular relations or friends to recommend me. My case is thrown\r\nexclusively upon the independent voters of the county; and, if\r\nelected, they will have conferred a favor upon me for which I shall be\r\nunremitting in my labors to compensate. But, if the good people in\r\ntheir wisdom shall see fit to keep me in the background, I have been too\r\nfamiliar with disappointments to be very much chagrined.\r\n\r\nYour friend and fellow-citizen, A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nNew Salem, March 9, 1832.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1833\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO E. C. BLANKENSHIP.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW SALEM, Aug. 10, 1833\r\n\r\nE. C. BLANKENSHIP.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:—In regard to the time David Rankin served the enclosed\r\ndischarge shows correctly—as well as I can recollect—having no writing\r\nto refer. The transfer of Rankin from my company occurred as follows:\r\nRankin having lost his horse at Dixon’s ferry and having acquaintance in\r\none of the foot companies who were going down the river was desirous\r\nto go with them, and one Galishen being an acquaintance of mine and\r\nbelonging to the company in which Rankin wished to go wished to leave\r\nit and join mine, this being the case it was agreed that they should\r\nexchange places and answer to each other’s names—as it was expected\r\nwe all would be discharged in very few days. As to a blanket—I have no\r\nknowledge of Rankin ever getting any. The above embraces all the facts\r\nnow in my recollection which are pertinent to the case.\r\n\r\nI shall take pleasure in giving any further information in my power\r\nshould you call on me.\r\n\r\nYour friend, A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR POSTAGE RECEIPT\r\n\r\n\r\nTO Mr. SPEARS.\r\n\r\nMr. SPEARS:\r\n\r\nAt your request I send you a receipt for the postage on your paper. I am\r\nsomewhat surprised at your request. I will, however, comply with it.\r\nThe law requires newspaper postage to be paid in advance, and now that\r\nI have waited a full year you choose to wound my feelings by insinuating\r\nthat unless you get a receipt I will probably make you pay it again.\r\n\r\nRespectfully, A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1836\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANNOUNCEMENT OF POLITICAL VIEWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Salem, June 13, 1836.\r\n\r\nTO THE EDITOR OF THE “JOURNAL”—In your paper of last Saturday I see\r\na communication, over the signature of “Many Voters,” in which the\r\ncandidates who are announced in the Journal are called upon to “show\r\ntheir hands.” Agreed. Here’s mine.\r\n\r\nI go for all sharing the privileges of the government who assist in\r\nbearing its burdens. Consequently, I go for admitting all whites to\r\nthe right of suffrage who pay taxes or bear arms (by no means excluding\r\nfemales).\r\n\r\nIf elected, I shall consider the whole people of Sangamon my\r\nconstituents, as well those that oppose as those that support me.\r\n\r\nWhile acting as their representative, I shall be governed by their will\r\non all subjects upon which I have the means of knowing what their will\r\nis; and upon all others I shall do what my own judgment teaches me\r\nwill best advance their interests. Whether elected or not, I go for\r\ndistributing the proceeds of the sales of the public lands to the\r\nseveral States, to enable our State, in common with others, to dig\r\ncanals and construct railroads without borrowing money and paying the\r\ninterest on it. If alive on the first Monday in November, I shall vote\r\nfor Hugh L. White for President.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESPONSE TO POLITICAL SMEAR\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ROBERT ALLEN\r\n\r\nNew Salem, June 21, 1836\r\n\r\nDEAR COLONEL:—I am told that during my absence last week you passed\r\nthrough this place, and stated publicly that you were in possession of a\r\nfact or facts which, if known to the public, would entirely destroy the\r\nprospects of N. W. Edwards and myself at the ensuing election; but that,\r\nthrough favor to us, you should forbear to divulge them. No one has\r\nneeded favors more than I, and, generally, few have been less unwilling\r\nto accept them; but in this case favor to me would be injustice to the\r\npublic, and therefore I must beg your pardon for declining it. That\r\nI once had the confidence of the people of Sangamon, is sufficiently\r\nevident; and if I have since done anything, either by design or\r\nmisadventure, which if known would subject me to a forfeiture of that\r\nconfidence, he that knows of that thing, and conceals it, is a traitor\r\nto his country’s interest.\r\n\r\nI find myself wholly unable to form any conjecture of what fact or\r\nfacts, real or supposed, you spoke; but my opinion of your veracity will\r\nnot permit me for a moment to doubt that you at least believed what you\r\nsaid. I am flattered with the personal regard you manifested for me;\r\nbut I do hope that, on more mature reflection, you will view the public\r\ninterest as a paramount consideration, and therefore determine to let\r\nthe worst come. I here assure you that the candid statement of facts\r\non your part, however low it may sink me, shall never break the tie of\r\npersonal friendship between us. I wish an answer to this, and you are at\r\nliberty to publish both, if you choose.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MISS MARY OWENS.\r\n\r\n\r\nVANDALIA, December 13, 1836.\r\n\r\nMARY:—I have been sick ever since my arrival, or I should have written\r\nsooner. It is but little difference, however, as I have very little\r\neven yet to write. And more, the longer I can avoid the mortification\r\nof looking in the post-office for your letter and not finding it, the\r\nbetter. You see I am mad about that old letter yet. I don’t like very\r\nwell to risk you again. I’ll try you once more, anyhow.\r\n\r\nThe new State House is not yet finished, and consequently the\r\nLegislature is doing little or nothing. The governor delivered an\r\ninflammatory political message, and it is expected there will be some\r\nsparring between the parties about it as soon as the two Houses get to\r\nbusiness. Taylor delivered up his petition for the new county to one\r\nof our members this morning. I am told he despairs of its success, on\r\naccount of all the members from Morgan County opposing it. There are\r\nnames enough on the petition, I think, to justify the members from our\r\ncounty in going for it; but if the members from Morgan oppose it, which\r\nthey say they will, the chance will be bad.\r\n\r\nOur chance to take the seat of government to Springfield is better than\r\nI expected. An internal-improvement convention was held there since we\r\nmet, which recommended a loan of several millions of dollars, on the\r\nfaith of the State, to construct railroads. Some of the Legislature are\r\nfor it, and some against it; which has the majority I cannot tell.\r\nThere is great strife and struggling for the office of the United States\r\nSenator here at this time. It is probable we shall ease their pains in\r\na few days. The opposition men have no candidate of their own, and\r\nconsequently they will smile as complacently at the angry snarl of the\r\ncontending Van Buren candidates and their respective friends as the\r\nChristian does at Satan’s rage. You recollect that I mentioned at the\r\noutset of this letter that I had been unwell. That is the fact, though\r\nI believe I am about well now; but that, with other things I cannot\r\naccount for, have conspired, and have gotten my spirits so low that I\r\nfeel that I would rather be any place in the world than here. I really\r\ncannot endure the thought of staying here ten weeks. Write back as soon\r\nas you get this, and, if possible, say something that will please me,\r\nfor really I have not been pleased since I left you. This letter is\r\nso dry and stupid that I am ashamed to send it, but with my present\r\nfeelings I cannot do any better.\r\n\r\nGive my best respects to Mr. and Mrs. Able and family.\r\n\r\nYour friend, LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1837\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH IN ILLINOIS LEGISLATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary [?], 1837\r\n\r\nMr. CHAIRMAN:—Lest I should fall into the too common error of being\r\nmistaken in regard to which side I design to be upon, I shall make it\r\nmy first care to remove all doubt on that point, by declaring that I am\r\nopposed to the resolution under consideration, in toto. Before I proceed\r\nto the body of the subject, I will further remark, that it is not\r\nwithout a considerable degree of apprehension that I venture to cross\r\nthe track of the gentleman from Coles [Mr. Linder]. Indeed, I do not\r\nbelieve I could muster a sufficiency of courage to come in contact with\r\nthat gentleman, were it not for the fact that he, some days since,\r\nmost graciously condescended to assure us that he would never be found\r\nwasting ammunition on small game. On the same fortunate occasion,\r\nhe further gave us to understand, that he regarded himself as being\r\ndecidedly the superior of our common friend from Randolph [Mr. Shields];\r\nand feeling, as I really do, that I, to say the most of myself, am\r\nnothing more than the peer of our friend from Randolph, I shall\r\nregard the gentleman from Coles as decidedly my superior also, and\r\nconsequently, in the course of what I shall have to say, whenever I\r\nshall have occasion to allude to that gentleman, I shall endeavor\r\nto adopt that kind of court language which I understand to be due to\r\ndecided superiority. In one faculty, at least, there can be no dispute\r\nof the gentleman’s superiority over me and most other men, and that is,\r\nthe faculty of entangling a subject, so that neither himself, or\r\nany other man, can find head or tail to it. Here he has introduced a\r\nresolution embracing ninety-nine printed lines across common writing\r\npaper, and yet more than one half of his opening speech has been made\r\nupon subjects about which there is not one word said in his resolution.\r\n\r\nThough his resolution embraces nothing in regard to the\r\nconstitutionality of the Bank, much of what he has said has been with\r\na view to make the impression that it was unconstitutional in its\r\ninception. Now, although I am satisfied that an ample field may be found\r\nwithin the pale of the resolution, at least for small game, yet, as\r\nthe gentleman has traveled out of it, I feel that I may, with all due\r\nhumility, venture to follow him. The gentleman has discovered that some\r\ngentleman at Washington city has been upon the very eve of deciding our\r\nBank unconstitutional, and that he would probably have completed his\r\nvery authentic decision, had not some one of the Bank officers placed\r\nhis hand upon his mouth, and begged him to withhold it. The fact\r\nthat the individuals composing our Supreme Court have, in an official\r\ncapacity, decided in favor of the constitutionality of the Bank, would,\r\nin my mind, seem a sufficient answer to this. It is a fact known to all,\r\nthat the members of the Supreme Court, together with the Governor, form\r\na Council of Revision, and that this Council approved this Bank charter.\r\nI ask, then, if the extra-judicial decision not quite but almost made\r\nby the gentleman at Washington, before whom, by the way, the question of\r\nthe constitutionality of our Bank never has, nor never can come—is to\r\nbe taken as paramount to a decision officially made by that tribunal,\r\nby which, and which alone, the constitutionality of the Bank can ever be\r\nsettled? But, aside from this view of the subject, I would ask, if the\r\ncommittee which this resolution proposes to appoint are to examine into\r\nthe Constitutionality of the Bank? Are they to be clothed with power to\r\nsend for persons and papers, for this object? And after they have found\r\nthe bank to be unconstitutional, and decided it so, how are they to\r\nenforce their decision? What will their decision amount to? They cannot\r\ncompel the Bank to cease operations, or to change the course of its\r\noperations. What good, then, can their labors result in? Certainly none.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman asks, if we, without an examination, shall, by giving the\r\nState deposits to the Bank, and by taking the stock reserved for the\r\nState, legalize its former misconduct. Now I do not pretend to possess\r\nsufficient legal knowledge to decide whether a legislative enactment\r\nproposing to, and accepting from, the Bank, certain terms, would have\r\nthe effect to legalize or wipe out its former errors, or not; but I can\r\nassure the gentleman, if such should be the effect, he has already got\r\nbehind the settlement of accounts; for it is well known to all, that the\r\nLegislature, at its last session, passed a supplemental Bank charter,\r\nwhich the Bank has since accepted, and which, according to his doctrine,\r\nhas legalized all the alleged violations of its original charter in the\r\ndistribution of its stock.\r\n\r\nI now proceed to the resolution. By examination it will be found that\r\nthe first thirty-three lines, being precisely one third of the whole,\r\nrelate exclusively to the distribution of the stock by the commissioners\r\nappointed by the State. Now, Sir, it is clear that no question can arise\r\non this portion of the resolution, except a question between capitalists\r\nin regard to the ownership of stock. Some gentlemen have their stock in\r\ntheir hands, while others, who have more money than they know what to\r\ndo with, want it; and this, and this alone, is the question, to settle\r\nwhich we are called on to squander thousands of the people’s money.\r\nWhat interest, let me ask, have the people in the settlement of this\r\nquestion? What difference is it to them whether the stock is owned by\r\nJudge Smith or Sam Wiggins? If any gentleman be entitled to stock in the\r\nBank, which he is kept out of possession of by others, let him assert\r\nhis right in the Supreme Court, and let him or his antagonist, whichever\r\nmay be found in the wrong, pay the costs of suit. It is an old maxim,\r\nand a very sound one, that he that dances should always pay the fiddler.\r\nNow, Sir, in the present case, if any gentlemen, whose money is a burden\r\nto them, choose to lead off a dance, I am decidedly opposed to the\r\npeople’s money being used to pay the fiddler. No one can doubt that the\r\nexamination proposed by this resolution must cost the State some ten or\r\ntwelve thousand dollars; and all this to settle a question in which\r\nthe people have no interest, and about which they care nothing. These\r\ncapitalists generally act harmoniously and in concert, to fleece the\r\npeople, and now that they have got into a quarrel with themselves we are\r\ncalled upon to appropriate the people’s money to settle the quarrel.\r\n\r\nI leave this part of the resolution and proceed to the remainder. It\r\nwill be found that no charge in the remaining part of the resolution, if\r\ntrue, amounts to the violation of the Bank charter, except one, which I\r\nwill notice in due time. It might seem quite sufficient to say no more\r\nupon any of these charges or insinuations than enough to show they are\r\nnot violations of the charter; yet, as they are ingeniously framed and\r\nhandled, with a view to deceive and mislead, I will notice in their\r\norder all the most prominent of them. The first of these is in relation\r\nto a connection between our Bank and several banking institutions in\r\nother States. Admitting this connection to exist, I should like to see\r\nthe gentleman from Coles, or any other gentleman, undertake to show that\r\nthere is any harm in it. What can there be in such a connection, that\r\nthe people of Illinois are willing to pay their money to get a peep\r\ninto? By a reference to the tenth section of the Bank charter, any\r\ngentleman can see that the framers of the act contemplated the holding\r\nof stock in the institutions of other corporations. Why, then, is it,\r\nwhen neither law nor justice forbids it, that we are asked to spend our\r\ntime and money in inquiring into its truth?\r\n\r\nThe next charge, in the order of time, is, that some officer, director,\r\nclerk or servant of the Bank, has been required to take an oath of\r\nsecrecy in relation to the affairs of said Bank. Now, I do not know\r\nwhether this be true or false—neither do I believe any honest man\r\ncares. I know that the seventh section of the charter expressly\r\nguarantees to the Bank the right of making, under certain restrictions,\r\nsuch by-laws as it may think fit; and I further know that the requiring\r\nan oath of secrecy would not transcend those restrictions. What, then,\r\nif the Bank has chosen to exercise this right? Whom can it injure? Does\r\nnot every merchant have his secret mark? and who is ever silly enough\r\nto complain of it? I presume if the Bank does require any such oath of\r\nsecrecy, it is done through a motive of delicacy to those individuals\r\nwho deal with it. Why, Sir, not many days since, one gentleman upon this\r\nfloor, who, by the way, I have no doubt is now ready to join this hue\r\nand cry against the Bank, indulged in a philippic against one of the\r\nBank officials, because, as he said, he had divulged a secret.\r\n\r\nImmediately following this last charge, there are several insinuations\r\nin the resolution, which are too silly to require any sort of notice,\r\nwere it not for the fact that they conclude by saying, “to the great\r\ninjury of the people at large.” In answer to this I would say that it\r\nis strange enough, that the people are suffering these “great injuries,”\r\nand yet are not sensible of it! Singular indeed that the people should\r\nbe writhing under oppression and injury, and yet not one among them\r\nto be found to raise the voice of complaint. If the Bank be inflicting\r\ninjury upon the people, why is it that not a single petition is\r\npresented to this body on the subject? If the Bank really be a\r\ngrievance, why is it that no one of the real people is found to ask\r\nredress of it? The truth is, no such oppression exists. If it did, our\r\npeople would groan with memorials and petitions, and we would not be\r\npermitted to rest day or night, till we had put it down. The people know\r\ntheir rights, and they are never slow to assert and maintain them, when\r\nthey are invaded. Let them call for an investigation, and I shall ever\r\nstand ready to respond to the call. But they have made no such call. I\r\nmake the assertion boldly, and without fear of contradiction, that no\r\nman, who does not hold an office, or does not aspire to one, has ever\r\nfound any fault of the Bank. It has doubled the prices of the products\r\nof their farms, and filled their pockets with a sound circulating\r\nmedium, and they are all well pleased with its operations. No, Sir, it\r\nis the politician who is the first to sound the alarm (which, by\r\nthe way, is a false one.) It is he, who, by these unholy means, is\r\nendeavoring to blow up a storm that he may ride upon and direct. It is\r\nhe, and he alone, that here proposes to spend thousands of the people’s\r\npublic treasure, for no other advantage to them than to make valueless\r\nin their pockets the reward of their industry. Mr. Chairman, this work\r\nis exclusively the work of politicians; a set of men who have interests\r\naside from the interests of the people, and who, to say the most of\r\nthem, are, taken as a mass, at least one long step removed from honest\r\nmen. I say this with the greater freedom, because, being a politician\r\nmyself, none can regard it as personal.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is charged, or rather insinuated, that officers of the Bank\r\nhave loaned money at usurious rates of interest. Suppose this to be\r\ntrue, are we to send a committee of this House to inquire into it?\r\nSuppose the committee should find it true, can they redress the injured\r\nindividuals? Assuredly not. If any individual had been injured in this\r\nway, is there not an ample remedy to be found in the laws of the land?\r\nDoes the gentleman from Coles know that there is a statute standing in\r\nfull force making it highly penal for an individual to loan money at a\r\nhigher rate of interest than twelve per cent? If he does not he is too\r\nignorant to be placed at the head of the committee which his resolution\r\npurposes and if he does, his neglect to mention it shows him to be too\r\nuncandid to merit the respect or confidence of any one.\r\n\r\nBut besides all this, if the Bank were struck from existence, could\r\nnot the owners of the capital still loan it usuriously, as well as now?\r\nwhatever the Bank, or its officers, may have done, I know that\r\nusurious transactions were much more frequent and enormous before the\r\ncommencement of its operations than they have ever been since.\r\n\r\nThe next insinuation is, that the Bank has refused specie payments.\r\nThis, if true is a violation of the charter. But there is not the\r\nleast probability of its truth; because, if such had been the fact, the\r\nindividual to whom payment was refused would have had an interest in\r\nmaking it public, by suing for the damages to which the charter entitles\r\nhim. Yet no such thing has been done; and the strong presumption is,\r\nthat the insinuation is false and groundless.\r\n\r\nFrom this to the end of the resolution, there is nothing that merits\r\nattention—I therefore drop the particular examination of it.\r\n\r\nBy a general view of the resolution, it will be seen that a principal\r\nobject of the committee is to examine into, and ferret out, a mass of\r\ncorruption supposed to have been committed by the commissioners\r\nwho apportioned the stock of the Bank. I believe it is universally\r\nunderstood and acknowledged that all men will ever act correctly unless\r\nthey have a motive to do otherwise. If this be true, we can only suppose\r\nthat the commissioners acted corruptly by also supposing that they were\r\nbribed to do so. Taking this view of the subject, I would ask if the\r\nBank is likely to find it more difficult to bribe the committee of\r\nseven, which, we are about to appoint, than it may have found it to\r\nbribe the commissioners?\r\n\r\n(Here Mr. Linder called to order. The Chair decided that Mr. Lincoln\r\nwas not out of order. Mr. Linder appealed to the House, but, before the\r\nquestion was put, withdrew his appeal, saying he preferred to let the\r\ngentleman go on; he thought he would break his own neck. Mr. Lincoln\r\nproceeded:)\r\n\r\nAnother gracious condescension! I acknowledge it with gratitude. I know\r\nI was not out of order; and I know every sensible man in the House knows\r\nit. I was not saying that the gentleman from Coles could be bribed, nor,\r\non the other hand, will I say he could not. In that particular I leave\r\nhim where I found him. I was only endeavoring to show that there was at\r\nleast as great a probability of any seven members that could be selected\r\nfrom this House being bribed to act corruptly, as there was that the\r\ntwenty-four commissioners had been so bribed. By a reference to\r\nthe ninth section of the Bank charter, it will be seen that those\r\ncommissioners were John Tilson, Robert K. McLaughlin, Daniel Warm, A.G.\r\nS. Wight, John C. Riley, W. H. Davidson, Edward M. Wilson, Edward L.\r\nPierson, Robert R. Green, Ezra Baker, Aquilla Wren, John Taylor, Samuel\r\nC. Christy, Edmund Roberts, Benjamin Godfrey, Thomas Mather, A. M.\r\nJenkins, W. Linn, W. S. Gilman, Charles Prentice, Richard I. Hamilton,\r\nA.H. Buckner, W. F. Thornton, and Edmund D. Taylor.\r\n\r\nThese are twenty-four of the most respectable men in the State. Probably\r\nno twenty-four men could be selected in the State with whom the people\r\nare better acquainted, or in whose honor and integrity they would\r\nmore readily place confidence. And I now repeat, that there is less\r\nprobability that those men have been bribed and corrupted, than that\r\nany seven men, or rather any six men, that could be selected from the\r\nmembers of this House, might be so bribed and corrupted, even though\r\nthey were headed and led on by “decided superiority” himself.\r\n\r\nIn all seriousness, I ask every reasonable man, if an issue be joined\r\nby these twenty-four commissioners, on the one part, and any other\r\nseven men, on the other part, and the whole depend upon the honor and\r\nintegrity of the contending parties, to which party would the greatest\r\ndegree of credit be due? Again: Another consideration is, that we have\r\nno right to make the examination. What I shall say upon this head I\r\ndesign exclusively for the law-loving and law-abiding part of the House.\r\nTo those who claim omnipotence for the Legislature, and who in the\r\nplenitude of their assumed powers are disposed to disregard the\r\nConstitution, law, good faith, moral right, and everything else, I have\r\nnot a word to say. But to the law-abiding part I say, examine the Bank\r\ncharter, go examine the Constitution, go examine the acts that the\r\nGeneral Assembly of this State has passed, and you will find just as\r\nmuch authority given in each and every of them to compel the Bank to\r\nbring its coffers to this hall and to pour their contents upon this\r\nfloor, as to compel it to submit to this examination which this\r\nresolution proposes. Why, Sir, the gentleman from Coles, the mover of\r\nthis resolution, very lately denied on this floor that the Legislature\r\nhad any right to repeal or otherwise meddle with its own acts, when\r\nthose acts were made in the nature of contracts, and had been accepted\r\nand acted on by other parties. Now I ask if this resolution does not\r\npropose, for this House alone, to do what he, but the other day, denied\r\nthe right of the whole Legislature to do? He must either abandon the\r\nposition he then took, or he must now vote against his own resolution.\r\nIt is no difference to me, and I presume but little to any one else,\r\nwhich he does.\r\n\r\nI am by no means the special advocate of the Bank. I have long thought\r\nthat it would be well for it to report its condition to the General\r\nAssembly, and that cases might occur, when it might be proper to make an\r\nexamination of its affairs by a committee. Accordingly, during the\r\nlast session, while a bill supplemental to the Bank charter was pending\r\nbefore the House, I offered an amendment to the same, in these words:\r\n“The said corporation shall, at the next session of the General\r\nAssembly, and at each subsequent General Session, during the existence\r\nof its charter, report to the same the amount of debts due from said\r\ncorporation; the amount of debts due to the same; the amount of specie\r\nin its vaults, and an account of all lands then owned by the same, and\r\nthe amount for which such lands have been taken; and moreover, if said\r\ncorporation shall at any time neglect or refuse to submit its books,\r\npapers, and all and everything necessary for a full and fair examination\r\nof its affairs, to any person or persons appointed by the General\r\nAssembly, for the purpose of making such examination, the said\r\ncorporation shall forfeit its charter.”\r\n\r\nThis amendment was negatived by a vote of 34 to 15. Eleven of the 34 who\r\nvoted against it are now members of this House; and though it would\r\nbe out of order to call their names, I hope they will all recollect\r\nthemselves, and not vote for this examination to be made without\r\nauthority, inasmuch as they refused to receive the authority when it was\r\nin their power to do so.\r\n\r\nI have said that cases might occur, when an examination might be proper;\r\nbut I do not believe any such case has now occurred; and if it has,\r\nI should still be opposed to making an examination without legal\r\nauthority. I am opposed to encouraging that lawless and mobocratic\r\nspirit, whether in relation to the Bank or anything else, which is\r\nalready abroad in the land and is spreading with rapid and fearful\r\nimpetuosity, to the ultimate overthrow of every institution, of every\r\nmoral principle, in which persons and property have hitherto found\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\nBut supposing we had the authority, I would ask what good can result\r\nfrom the examination? Can we declare the Bank unconstitutional, and\r\ncompel it to desist from the abuses of its power, provided we find such\r\nabuses to exist? Can we repair the injuries which it may have done to\r\nindividuals? Most certainly we can do none of these things. Why\r\nthen shall we spend the public money in such employment? Oh, say the\r\nexaminers, we can injure the credit of the Bank, if nothing else, Please\r\ntell me, gentlemen, who will suffer most by that? You cannot injure, to\r\nany extent, the stockholders. They are men of wealth—of large capital;\r\nand consequently, beyond the power of malice. But by injuring the credit\r\nof the Bank, you will depreciate the value of its paper in the hands of\r\nthe honest and unsuspecting farmer and mechanic, and that is all you can\r\ndo. But suppose you could effect your whole purpose; suppose you could\r\nwipe the Bank from existence, which is the grand ultimatum of the\r\nproject, what would be the consequence? why, Sir, we should spend\r\nseveral thousand dollars of the public treasure in the operation,\r\nannihilate the currency of the State, render valueless in the hands of\r\nour people that reward of their former labors, and finally be once more\r\nunder the comfortable obligation of paying the Wiggins loan, principal\r\nand interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPPOSITION TO MOB-RULE\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS BEFORE THE YOUNG MEN’S LYCEUM OF SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS.\r\n\r\nJanuary 27, 1838.\r\n\r\nAs a subject for the remarks of the evening, “The Perpetuation of our\r\nPolitical Institutions” is selected.\r\n\r\nIn the great journal of things happening under the sun, we, the American\r\npeople, find our account running under date of the nineteenth century of\r\nthe Christian era. We find ourselves in the peaceful possession of the\r\nfairest portion of the earth as regards extent of territory, fertility\r\nof soil, and salubrity of climate. We find ourselves under the\r\ngovernment of a system of political institutions conducing more\r\nessentially to the ends of civil and religious liberty than any of which\r\nthe history of former times tells us. We, when mounting the stage of\r\nexistence, found ourselves the legal inheritors of these fundamental\r\nblessings. We toiled not in the acquirement or establishment of them;\r\nthey are a legacy bequeathed us by a once hardy, brave, and patriotic,\r\nbut now lamented and departed, race of ancestors. Theirs was the\r\ntask (and nobly they performed it) to possess themselves, and through\r\nthemselves us, of this goodly land, and to uprear upon its hills and its\r\nvalleys a political edifice of liberty and equal rights; it is ours only\r\nto transmit these—the former unprofaned by the foot of an invader, the\r\nlatter undecayed by the lapse of time and untorn by usurpation—to the\r\nlatest generation that fate shall permit the world to know. This task\r\ngratitude to our fathers, justice to ourselves, duty to posterity, and\r\nlove for our species in general, all imperatively require us faithfully\r\nto perform.\r\n\r\nHow then shall we perform it? At what point shall we expect the approach\r\nof danger? By what means shall we fortify against it? Shall we expect\r\nsome transatlantic military giant to step the ocean and crush us at a\r\nblow? Never! All the armies of Europe, Asia, and Africa combined, with\r\nall the treasure of the earth (our own excepted) in their military\r\nchest, with a Bonaparte for a commander, could not by force take a drink\r\nfrom the Ohio or make a track on the Blue Ridge in a trial of a thousand\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nAt what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer:\r\nIf it ever reach us it must spring up amongst us; it cannot come from\r\nabroad. If destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and\r\nfinisher. As a nation of freemen we must live through all time, or die\r\nby suicide.\r\n\r\nI hope I am over-wary; but if I am not, there is even now something\r\nof ill omen amongst us. I mean the increasing disregard for law which\r\npervades the country—the growing disposition to substitute the wild and\r\nfurious passions in lieu of the sober judgment of courts, and the\r\nworse than savage mobs for the executive ministers of justice. This\r\ndisposition is awfully fearful in any community; and that it now\r\nexists in ours, though grating to our feelings to admit, it would be a\r\nviolation of truth and an insult to our intelligence to deny. Accounts\r\nof outrages committed by mobs form the everyday news of the times.\r\nThey have pervaded the country from New England to Louisiana; they are\r\nneither peculiar to the eternal snows of the former nor the burning suns\r\nof the latter; they are not the creature of climate, neither are they\r\nconfined to the slave holding or the non-slave holding States. Alike\r\nthey spring up among the pleasure-hunting masters of Southern slaves,\r\nand the order-loving citizens of the land of steady habits. Whatever\r\nthen their cause may be, it is common to the whole country.\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious as well as useless to recount the horrors of all of\r\nthem. Those happening in the State of Mississippi and at St. Louis are\r\nperhaps the most dangerous in example and revolting to humanity. In the\r\nMississippi case they first commenced by hanging the regular gamblers—a\r\nset of men certainly not following for a livelihood a very useful or\r\nvery honest occupation, but one which, so far from being forbidden by\r\nthe laws, was actually licensed by an act of the Legislature passed but\r\na single year before. Next, negroes suspected of conspiring to raise an\r\ninsurrection were caught up and hanged in all parts of the State;\r\nthen, white men supposed to be leagued with the negroes; and finally,\r\nstrangers from neighboring States, going thither on business, were in\r\nmany instances subjected to the same fate. Thus went on this process of\r\nhanging, from gamblers to negroes, from negroes to white citizens, and\r\nfrom these to strangers, till dead men were seen literally dangling\r\nfrom the boughs of trees upon every roadside, and in numbers almost\r\nsufficient to rival the native Spanish moss of the country as a drapery\r\nof the forest.\r\n\r\nTurn then to that horror-striking scene at St. Louis. A single victim\r\nonly was sacrificed there. This story is very short, and is perhaps\r\nthe most highly tragic of anything of its length that has ever been\r\nwitnessed in real life. A mulatto man by the name of McIntosh was seized\r\nin the street, dragged to the suburbs of the city, chained to a tree,\r\nand actually burned to death; and all within a single hour from the time\r\nhe had been a freeman attending to his own business and at peace with\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nSuch are the effects of mob law, and such are the scenes becoming more\r\nand more frequent in this land so lately famed for love of law and\r\norder, and the stories of which have even now grown too familiar to\r\nattract anything more than an idle remark.\r\n\r\nBut you are perhaps ready to ask, “What has this to do with the\r\nperpetuation of our political institutions?” I answer, It has much to\r\ndo with it. Its direct consequences are, comparatively speaking, but\r\na small evil, and much of its danger consists in the proneness of\r\nour minds to regard its direct as its only consequences. Abstractly\r\nconsidered, the hanging of the gamblers at Vicksburg was of but little\r\nconsequence. They constitute a portion of population that is worse than\r\nuseless in any community; and their death, if no pernicious example be\r\nset by it, is never matter of reasonable regret with any one. If\r\nthey were annually swept from the stage of existence by the plague or\r\nsmallpox, honest men would perhaps be much profited by the operation.\r\nSimilar too is the correct reasoning in regard to the burning of the\r\nnegro at St. Louis. He had forfeited his life by the perpetration of an\r\noutrageous murder upon one of the most worthy and respectable citizens\r\nof the city, and had he not died as he did, he must have died by the\r\nsentence of the law in a very short time afterwards. As to him alone,\r\nit was as well the way it was as it could otherwise have been. But the\r\nexample in either case was fearful. When men take it in their heads\r\nto-day to hang gamblers or burn murderers, they should recollect that in\r\nthe confusion usually attending such transactions they will be as likely\r\nto hang or burn some one who is neither a gambler nor a murderer as one\r\nwho is, and that, acting upon the example they set, the mob of to-morrow\r\nmay, and probably will, hang or burn some of them by the very same\r\nmistake. And not only so: the innocent, those who have ever set their\r\nfaces against violations of law in every shape, alike with the guilty\r\nfall victims to the ravages of mob law; and thus it goes on, step by\r\nstep, till all the walls erected for the defense of the persons and\r\nproperty of individuals are trodden down and disregarded. But all this,\r\neven, is not the full extent of the evil. By such examples, by instances\r\nof the perpetrators of such acts going unpunished, the lawless in spirit\r\nare encouraged to become lawless in practice; and having been used to\r\nno restraint but dread of punishment, they thus become absolutely\r\nunrestrained. Having ever regarded government as their deadliest bane,\r\nthey make a jubilee of the suspension of its operations, and pray for\r\nnothing so much as its total annihilation. While, on the other hand,\r\ngood men, men who love tranquillity, who desire to abide by the laws and\r\nenjoy their benefits, who would gladly spill their blood in the defense\r\nof their country, seeing their property destroyed, their families\r\ninsulted, and their lives endangered, their persons injured, and seeing\r\nnothing in prospect that forebodes a change for the better, become tired\r\nof and disgusted with a government that offers them no protection, and\r\nare not much averse to a change in which they imagine they have nothing\r\nto lose. Thus, then, by the operation of this mobocratic spirit which\r\nall must admit is now abroad in the land, the strongest bulwark of\r\nany government, and particularly of those constituted like ours, may\r\neffectually be broken down and destroyed—I mean the attachment of the\r\npeople. Whenever this effect shall be produced among us; whenever the\r\nvicious portion of population shall be permitted to gather in bands\r\nof hundreds and thousands, and burn churches, ravage and rob\r\nprovision-stores, throw printing presses into rivers, shoot editors, and\r\nhang and burn obnoxious persons at pleasure and with impunity, depend on\r\nit, this government cannot last. By such things the feelings of the best\r\ncitizens will become more or less alienated from it, and thus it will\r\nbe left without friends, or with too few, and those few too weak to\r\nmake their friendship effectual. At such a time, and under such\r\ncircumstances, men of sufficient talent and ambition will not be wanting\r\nto seize the opportunity, strike the blow, and overturn that fair fabric\r\nwhich for the last half century has been the fondest hope of the lovers\r\nof freedom throughout the world.\r\n\r\nI know the American people are much attached to their government; I know\r\nthey would suffer much for its sake; I know they would endure evils\r\nlong and patiently before they would ever think of exchanging it for\r\nanother,—yet, notwithstanding all this, if the laws be continually\r\ndespised and disregarded, if their rights to be secure in their persons\r\nand property are held by no better tenure than the caprice of a mob,\r\nthe alienation of their affections from the government is the natural\r\nconsequence; and to that, sooner or later, it must come.\r\n\r\nHere, then, is one point at which danger may be expected.\r\n\r\nThe question recurs, How shall we fortify against it? The answer is\r\nsimple. Let every American, every lover of liberty, every well-wisher to\r\nhis posterity swear by the blood of the Revolution never to violate\r\nin the least particular the laws of the country, and never to tolerate\r\ntheir violation by others. As the patriots of seventy-six did to the\r\nsupport of the Declaration of Independence, so to the support of the\r\nConstitution and laws let every American pledge his life, his property,\r\nand his sacred honor. Let every man remember that to violate the law is\r\nto trample on the blood of his father, and to tear the charter of his\r\nown and his children’s liberty. Let reverence for the laws be breathed\r\nby every American mother to the lisping babe that prattles on her lap;\r\nlet it be taught in schools, in seminaries, and in colleges; let it be\r\nwritten in primers, spelling books, and in almanacs; let it be preached\r\nfrom the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative halls, and enforced in courts\r\nof justice. And, in short, let it become the political religion of the\r\nnation; and let the old and the young, the rich and the poor, the\r\ngrave and the gay of all sexes and tongues and colors and conditions,\r\nsacrifice unceasingly upon its altars.\r\n\r\nWhile ever a state of feeling such as this shall universally or even\r\nvery generally prevail throughout the nation, vain will be every effort,\r\nand fruitless every attempt, to subvert our national freedom.\r\n\r\nWhen, I so pressingly urge a strict observance of all the laws, let me\r\nnot be understood as saying there are no bad laws, or that grievances\r\nmay not arise for the redress of which no legal provisions have been\r\nmade. I mean to say no such thing. But I do mean to say that although\r\nbad laws, if they exist, should be repealed as soon as possible, still,\r\nwhile they continue in force, for the sake of example they should be\r\nreligiously observed. So also in unprovided cases. If such arise, let\r\nproper legal provisions be made for them with the least possible delay,\r\nbut till then let them, if not too intolerable, be borne with.\r\n\r\nThere is no grievance that is a fit object of redress by mob law. In any\r\ncase that may arise, as, for instance, the promulgation of abolitionism,\r\none of two positions is necessarily true—that is, the thing is right\r\nwithin itself, and therefore deserves the protection of all law and all\r\ngood citizens, or it is wrong, and therefore proper to be prohibited by\r\nlegal enactments; and in neither case is the interposition of mob law\r\neither necessary, justifiable, or excusable.\r\n\r\nBut it may be asked, Why suppose danger to our political institutions?\r\nHave we not preserved them for more than fifty years? And why may we not\r\nfor fifty times as long?\r\n\r\nWe hope there is no sufficient reason. We hope all danger may be\r\novercome; but to conclude that no danger may ever arise would itself be\r\nextremely dangerous. There are now, and will hereafter be, many causes,\r\ndangerous in their tendency, which have not existed heretofore, and\r\nwhich are not too insignificant to merit attention. That our government\r\nshould have been maintained in its original form, from its establishment\r\nuntil now, is not much to be wondered at. It had many props to support\r\nit through that period, which now are decayed and crumbled away. Through\r\nthat period it was felt by all to be an undecided experiment; now it is\r\nunderstood to be a successful one. Then, all that sought celebrity\r\nand fame and distinction expected to find them in the success of that\r\nexperiment. Their all was staked upon it; their destiny was inseparably\r\nlinked with it. Their ambition aspired to display before an admiring\r\nworld a practical demonstration of the truth of a proposition which had\r\nhitherto been considered at best no better than problematical—namely,\r\nthe capability of a people to govern themselves. If they succeeded they\r\nwere to be immortalized; their names were to be transferred to counties,\r\nand cities, and rivers, and mountains; and to be revered and sung,\r\ntoasted through all time. If they failed, they were to be called\r\nknaves and fools, and fanatics for a fleeting hour; then to sink and be\r\nforgotten. They succeeded. The experiment is successful, and thousands\r\nhave won their deathless names in making it so. But the game is caught;\r\nand I believe it is true that with the catching end the pleasures of\r\nthe chase. This field of glory is harvested, and the crop is already\r\nappropriated. But new reapers will arise, and they too will seek a\r\nfield. It is to deny what the history of the world tells us is true, to\r\nsuppose that men of ambition and talents will not continue to spring\r\nup amongst us. And when they do, they will as naturally seek the\r\ngratification of their ruling passion as others have done before them.\r\nThe question then is, Can that gratification be found in supporting\r\nand in maintaining an edifice that has been erected by others? Most\r\ncertainly it cannot. Many great and good men, sufficiently qualified for\r\nany task they should undertake, may ever be found whose ambition would\r\naspire to nothing beyond a seat in Congress, a Gubernatorial or a\r\nPresidential chair; but such belong not to the family of the lion, or\r\nthe tribe of the eagle. What! think you these places would satisfy an\r\nAlexander, a Caesar, or a Napoleon? Never! Towering genius disdains\r\na beaten path. It seeks regions hitherto unexplored. It sees no\r\ndistinction in adding story to story upon the monuments of fame erected\r\nto the memory of others. It denies that it is glory enough to serve\r\nunder any chief. It scorns to tread in the footsteps of any predecessor,\r\nhowever illustrious. It thirsts and burns for distinction; and if\r\npossible, it will have it, whether at the expense of emancipating slaves\r\nor enslaving freemen. Is it unreasonable, then, to expect that some man\r\npossessed of the loftiest genius, coupled with ambition sufficient to\r\npush it to its utmost stretch, will at some time spring up among us? And\r\nwhen such an one does it will require the people to be united with each\r\nother, attached to the government and laws, and generally intelligent,\r\nto successfully frustrate his designs.\r\n\r\nDistinction will be his paramount object, and although he would as\r\nwillingly, perhaps more so, acquire it by doing good as harm, yet,\r\nthat opportunity being past, and nothing left to be done in the way of\r\nbuilding up, he would set boldly to the task of pulling down.\r\n\r\nHere then is a probable case, highly dangerous, and such an one as could\r\nnot have well existed heretofore.\r\n\r\nAnother reason which once was, but which, to the same extent, is now no\r\nmore, has done much in maintaining our institutions thus far. I mean the\r\npowerful influence which the interesting scenes of the Revolution had\r\nupon the passions of the people as distinguished from their judgment. By\r\nthis influence, the jealousy, envy, and avarice incident to our nature,\r\nand so common to a state of peace, prosperity, and conscious strength,\r\nwere for the time in a great measure smothered and rendered inactive,\r\nwhile the deep-rooted principles of hate, and the powerful motive of\r\nrevenge, instead of being turned against each other, were directed\r\nexclusively against the British nation. And thus, from the force of\r\ncircumstances, the basest principles of our nature were either made to\r\nlie dormant, or to become the active agents in the advancement of\r\nthe noblest of causes—that of establishing and maintaining civil and\r\nreligious liberty.\r\n\r\nBut this state of feeling must fade, is fading, has faded, with the\r\ncircumstances that produced it.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to say that the scenes of the Revolution are now or ever\r\nwill be entirely forgotten, but that, like everything else, they must\r\nfade upon the memory of the world, and grow more and more dim by the\r\nlapse of time. In history, we hope, they will be read of, and recounted,\r\nso long as the Bible shall be read; but even granting that they will,\r\ntheir influence cannot be what it heretofore has been. Even then they\r\ncannot be so universally known nor so vividly felt as they were by the\r\ngeneration just gone to rest. At the close of that struggle, nearly\r\nevery adult male had been a participator in some of its scenes. The\r\nconsequence was that of those scenes, in the form of a husband, a\r\nfather, a son, or a brother, a living history was to be found in\r\nevery family—a history bearing the indubitable testimonies of its own\r\nauthenticity, in the limbs mangled, in the scars of wounds received, in\r\nthe midst of the very scenes related—a history, too, that could be read\r\nand understood alike by all, the wise and the ignorant, the learned and\r\nthe unlearned. But those histories are gone. They can be read no more\r\nforever. They were a fortress of strength; but what invading foeman\r\ncould never do the silent artillery of time has done—the leveling of\r\nits walls. They are gone. They were a forest of giant oaks; but the\r\nall-restless hurricane has swept over them, and left only here and\r\nthere a lonely trunk, despoiled of its verdure, shorn of its foliage,\r\nunshading and unshaded, to murmur in a few more gentle breezes, and to\r\ncombat with its mutilated limbs a few more ruder storms, then to sink\r\nand be no more.\r\n\r\nThey were pillars of the temple of liberty; and now that they have\r\ncrumbled away that temple must fall unless we, their descendants, supply\r\ntheir places with other pillars, hewn from the solid quarry of sober\r\nreason. Passion has helped us, but can do so no more. It will in future\r\nbe our enemy. Reason cold, calculating, unimpassioned reason—must\r\nfurnish all the materials for our future support and defense. Let those\r\nmaterials be moulded into general intelligence, sound morality, and\r\nin particular, a reverence for the Constitution and laws; and that we\r\nimproved to the last, that we remained free to the last, that we revered\r\nhis name to the last, that during his long sleep we permitted no hostile\r\nfoot to pass over or desecrate his resting place, shall be that which to\r\nlearn the last trump shall awaken our Washington.\r\n\r\nUpon these let the proud fabric of freedom rest, as the rock of its\r\nbasis; and as truly as has been said of the only greater institution,\r\n“the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTEST IN THE ILLINOIS LEGISLATURE ON THE SUBJECT OF SLAVERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch 3, 1837.\r\n\r\nThe following protest was presented to the House, which was read and\r\nordered to be spread in the journals, to wit:\r\n\r\n“Resolutions upon the subject of domestic slavery having passed both\r\nbranches of the General Assembly at its present session, the undersigned\r\nhereby protest against the passage of the same.\r\n\r\n“They believe that the institution of slavery is founded on both\r\ninjustice and bad policy, but that the promulgation of abolition\r\ndoctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils.\r\n\r\n“They believe that the Congress of the United States has no power under\r\nthe Constitution to interfere with the institution of slavery in the\r\ndifferent States.\r\n\r\n“They believe that the Congress of the United States has the power,\r\nunder the Constitution, to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia,\r\nbut that the power ought not to be exercised, unless at the request of\r\nthe people of the District.\r\n\r\n“The difference between these opinions and those contained in the said\r\nresolutions is their reason for entering this protest.\r\n\r\n“DAN STONE,\r\n\r\n“A. LINCOLN,\r\n\r\n“Representatives from the County of Sangamon.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MISS MARY OWENS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, May 7, 1837.\r\n\r\nMISS MARY S. OWENS.\r\n\r\nFRIEND MARY:—I have commenced two letters to send you before this, both\r\nof which displeased me before I got half done, and so I tore them up.\r\nThe first I thought was not serious enough, and the second was on the\r\nother extreme. I shall send this, turn out as it may.\r\n\r\nThis thing of living in Springfield is rather a dull business, after\r\nall; at least it is so to me. I am quite as lonesome here as I ever was\r\nanywhere in my life. I have been spoken to by but one woman since I have\r\nbeen here, and should not have been by her if she could have avoided it.\r\nI ’ve never been to church yet, and probably shall not be soon. I stay\r\naway because I am conscious I should not know how to behave myself.\r\n\r\nI am often thinking of what we said about your coming to live at\r\nSpringfield. I am afraid you would not be satisfied. There is a great\r\ndeal of flourishing about in carriages here, which it would be your doom\r\nto see without sharing it. You would have to be poor, without the means\r\nof hiding your poverty. Do you believe you could bear that patiently?\r\nWhatever woman may cast her lot with mine, should any ever do so, it is\r\nmy intention to do all in my power to make her happy and contented; and\r\nthere is nothing I can imagine that would make me more unhappy than to\r\nfail in the effort. I know I should be much happier with you than the\r\nway I am, provided I saw no signs of discontent in you. What you have\r\nsaid to me may have been in the way of jest, or I may have misunderstood\r\nyou. If so, then let it be forgotten; if otherwise, I much wish you\r\nwould think seriously before you decide. What I have said I will most\r\npositively abide by, provided you wish it. My opinion is that you had\r\nbetter not do it. You have not been accustomed to hardship, and it may\r\nbe more severe than you now imagine. I know you are capable of thinking\r\ncorrectly on any subject, and if you deliberate maturely upon this\r\nsubject before you decide, then I am willing to abide your decision.\r\n\r\nYou must write me a good long letter after you get this. You have\r\nnothing else to do, and though it might not seem interesting to you\r\nafter you had written it, it would be a good deal of company to me in\r\nthis “busy wilderness.” Tell your sister I don’t want to hear any more\r\nabout selling out and moving. That gives me the “hypo” whenever I think\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nYours, etc., LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN BENNETT.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., Aug. 5, 1837. JOHN BENNETT, ESQ.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:—Mr. Edwards tells me you wish to know whether the act to which\r\nyour own incorporation provision was attached passed into a law. It\r\ndid. You can organize under the general incorporation law as soon as you\r\nchoose.\r\n\r\nI also tacked a provision onto a fellow’s bill to authorize the\r\nrelocation of the road from Salem down to your town, but I am not\r\ncertain whether or not the bill passed, neither do I suppose I can\r\nascertain before the law will be published, if it is a law. Bowling\r\nGreene, Bennette Abe? and yourself are appointed to make the change. No\r\nnews. No excitement except a little about the election of Monday next.\r\n\r\nI suppose, of course, our friend Dr. Heney stands no chance in your\r\ndiggings.\r\n\r\nYour friend and humble servant, A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MARY OWENS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Aug. 16, 1837\r\n\r\nFRIEND MARY: You will no doubt think it rather strange that I should\r\nwrite you a letter on the same day on which we parted, and I can only\r\naccount for it by supposing that seeing you lately makes me think of you\r\nmore than usual; while at our late meeting we had but few expressions\r\nof thoughts. You must know that I cannot see you, or think of you, with\r\nentire indifference; and yet it may be that you are mistaken in regard\r\nto what my real feelings toward you are.\r\n\r\nIf I knew you were not, I should not have troubled you with this letter.\r\nPerhaps any other man would know enough without information; but I\r\nconsider it my peculiar right to plead ignorance, and your bounden duty\r\nto allow the plea.\r\n\r\nI want in all cases to do right; and most particularly so in all cases\r\nwith women.\r\n\r\nI want, at this particular time, more than any thing else to do right\r\nwith you; and if I knew it would be doing right, as I rather suspect it\r\nwould, to let you alone I would do it. And, for the purpose of making\r\nthe matter as plain as possible, I now say that you can drop the\r\nsubject, dismiss your thoughts (if you ever had any) from me for ever\r\nand leave this letter unanswered without calling forth one accusing\r\nmurmur from me. And I will even go further and say that, if it will add\r\nanything to your comfort or peace of mind to do so, it is my sincere\r\nwish that you should. Do not understand by this that I wish to cut your\r\nacquaintance. I mean no such thing. What I do wish is that our further\r\nacquaintance shall depend upon yourself. If such further acquaintance\r\nwould contribute nothing to your happiness, I am sure it would not to\r\nmine. If you feel yourself in any degree bound to me, I am now willing\r\nto release you, provided you wish it; while on the other hand I am\r\nwilling and even anxious to bind you faster if I can be convinced\r\nthat it will, in any considerable degree, add to your happiness. This,\r\nindeed, is the whole question with me. Nothing would make me more\r\nmiserable than to believe you miserable, nothing more happy than to know\r\nyou were so.\r\n\r\nIn what I have now said, I think I cannot be misunderstood; and to make\r\nmyself understood is the only object of this letter.\r\n\r\nIf it suits you best not to answer this, farewell. A long life and\r\na merry one attend you. But, if you conclude to write back, speak as\r\nplainly as I do. There can neither be harm nor danger in saying to me\r\nanything you think, just in the manner you think it. My respects to your\r\nsister.\r\n\r\nYour friend, LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEGAL SUIT OF WIDOW v.s. Gen. ADAMS\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PEOPLE.\r\n\r\n“SANGAMON JOURNAL,” SPRINGFIELD, ILL., Aug. 19, 1837.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with our determination, as expressed last week, we present\r\nto the reader the articles which were published in hand-bill form, in\r\nreference to the case of the heirs of Joseph Anderson vs. James Adams.\r\nThese articles can now be read uninfluenced by personal or party\r\nfeeling, and with the sole motive of learning the truth. When that is\r\ndone, the reader can pass his own judgment on the matters at issue.\r\n\r\nWe only regret in this case, that the publications were not made some\r\nweeks before the election. Such a course might have prevented the\r\nexpressions of regret, which have often been heard since, from different\r\nindividuals, on account of the disposition they made of their votes.\r\n\r\nTo the Public:\r\n\r\nIt is well known to most of you, that there is existing at this time\r\nconsiderable excitement in regard to Gen. Adams’s titles to certain\r\ntracts of land, and the manner in which he acquired them. As I\r\nunderstand, the Gen. charges that the whole has been gotten up by a knot\r\nof lawyers to injure his election; and as I am one of the knot to which\r\nhe refers, and as I happen to be in possession of facts connected with\r\nthe matter, I will, in as brief a manner as possible, make a statement\r\nof them, together with the means by which I arrived at the knowledge of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSometime in May or June last, a widow woman, by the name of Anderson,\r\nand her son, who resides in Fulton county, came to Springfield, for\r\nthe purpose as they said of selling a ten acre lot of ground lying near\r\ntown, which they claimed as the property of the deceased husband and\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached town they found the land was claimed by Gen. Adams.\r\nJohn T. Stuart and myself were employed to look into the matter, and if\r\nit was thought we could do so with any prospect of success, to commence\r\na suit for the land. I went immediately to the recorder’s office to\r\nexamine Adams’s title, and found that the land had been entered by one\r\nDixon, deeded by Dixon to Thomas, by Thomas to one Miller, and by Miller\r\nto Gen. Adams. The oldest of these three deeds was about ten or eleven\r\nyears old, and the latest more than five, all recorded at the same\r\ntime, and that within less than one year. This I thought a suspicious\r\ncircumstance, and I was thereby induced to examine the deeds very\r\nclosely, with a view to the discovery of some defect by which to\r\noverturn the title, being almost convinced then it was founded in fraud.\r\nI discovered that in the deed from Thomas to Miller, although Miller’s\r\nname stood in a sort of marginal note on the record book, it was nowhere\r\nin the deed itself. I told the fact to Talbott, the recorder, and\r\nproposed to him that he should go to Gen. Adams’s and get the original\r\ndeed, and compare it with the record, and thereby ascertain whether\r\nthe defect was in the original or there was merely an error in the\r\nrecording. As Talbott afterwards told me, he went to the General’s, but\r\nnot finding him at home, got the deed from his son, which, when compared\r\nwith the record, proved what we had discovered was merely an error of\r\nthe recorder. After Mr. Talbott corrected the record, he brought the\r\noriginal to our office, as I then thought and think yet, to show us\r\nthat it was right. When he came into the room he handed the deed to me,\r\nremarking that the fault was all his own. On opening it, another paper\r\nfell out of it, which on examination proved to be an assignment of a\r\njudgment in the Circuit Court of Sangamon County from Joseph Anderson,\r\nthe late husband of the widow above named, to James Adams, the judgment\r\nbeing in favor of said Anderson against one Joseph Miller. Knowing that\r\nthis judgment had some connection with the land affair, I immediately\r\ntook a copy of it, which is word for word, letter for letter and cross\r\nfor cross as follows:\r\n\r\nJoseph Anderson, vs. Joseph Miller.\r\n\r\nJudgment in Sangamon Circuit Court against Joseph Miller obtained on a\r\nnote originally 25 dolls and interest thereon accrued. I assign all my\r\nright, title and interest to James Adams which is in consideration of a\r\ndebt I owe said Adams.\r\n\r\nhis JOSEPH x ANDERSON. mark.\r\n\r\nAs the copy shows, it bore date May 10, 1827; although the judgment\r\nassigned by it was not obtained until the October afterwards, as may be\r\nseen by any one on the records of the Circuit Court. Two other strange\r\ncircumstances attended it which cannot be represented by a copy. One of\r\nthem was, that the date “1827” had first been made “1837” and, without\r\nthe figure “3,” being fully obliterated, the figure “2” had afterwards\r\nbeen made on top of it; the other was that, although the date was ten\r\nyears old, the writing on it, from the freshness of its appearance, was\r\nthought by many, and I believe by all who saw it, not to be more than a\r\nweek old. The paper on which it was written had a very old appearance;\r\nand there were some old figures on the back of it which made the\r\nfreshness of the writing on the face of it much more striking than I\r\nsuppose it otherwise might have been. The reader’s curiosity is no doubt\r\nexcited to know what connection this assignment had with the land in\r\nquestion. The story is this: Dixon sold and deeded the land to Thomas;\r\nThomas sold it to Anderson; but before he gave a deed, Anderson sold it\r\nto Miller, and took Miller’s note for the purchase money. When this\r\nnote became due, Anderson sued Miller on it, and Miller procured an\r\ninjunction from the Court of Chancery to stay the collection of the\r\nmoney until he should get a deed for the land. Gen. Adams was employed\r\nas an attorney by Anderson in this chancery suit, and at the October\r\nterm, 1827, the injunction was dissolved, and a judgment given in favor\r\nof Anderson against Miller; and it was provided that Thomas was to\r\nexecute a deed for the land in favor of Miller and deliver it to Gen.\r\nAdams, to be held up by him till Miller paid the judgment, and then to\r\ndeliver it to him. Miller left the county without paying the judgment.\r\nAnderson moved to Fulton county, where he has since died When the widow\r\ncame to Springfield last May or June, as before mentioned, and found the\r\nland deeded to Gen. Adams by Miller, she was naturally led to inquire\r\nwhy the money due upon the judgment had not been sent to them, inasmuch\r\nas he, Gen. Adams, had no authority to deliver Thomas’s deed to Miller\r\nuntil the money was paid. Then it was the General told her, or perhaps\r\nher son, who came with her, that Anderson, in his lifetime, had assigned\r\nthe judgment to him, Gen. Adams. I am now told that the General is\r\nexhibiting an assignment of the same judgment bearing date “1828” and\r\nin other respects differing from the one described; and that he is\r\nasserting that no such assignment as the one copied by me ever existed;\r\nor if there did, it was forged between Talbott and the lawyers, and\r\nslipped into his papers for the purpose of injuring him. Now, I can only\r\nsay that I know precisely such a one did exist, and that Ben. Talbott,\r\nWm. Butler, C.R. Matheny, John T. Stuart, Judge Logan, Robert Irwin, P.\r\nC. Canedy and S. M. Tinsley, all saw and examined it, and that at least\r\none half of them will swear that IT WAS IN GENERAL ADAMS’S HANDWRITING!!\r\nAnd further, I know that Talbott will swear that he got it out of the\r\nGeneral’s possession, and returned it into his possession again. The\r\nassignment which the General is now exhibiting purports to have been by\r\nAnderson in writing. The one I copied was signed with a cross.\r\n\r\nI am told that Gen. Neale says that he will swear that he heard Gen.\r\nAdams tell young Anderson that the assignment made by his father was\r\nsigned with a cross.\r\n\r\nThe above are ‘facts,’ as stated. I leave them without comment. I have\r\ngiven the names of persons who have knowledge of these facts, in order\r\nthat any one who chooses may call on them and ascertain how far they\r\nwill corroborate my statements. I have only made these statements\r\nbecause I am known by many to be one of the individuals against whom\r\nthe charge of forging the assignment and slipping it into the General’s\r\npapers has been made, and because our silence might be construed into\r\na confession of its truth. I shall not subscribe my name; but I hereby\r\nauthorize the editor of the Journal to give it up to any one that may\r\ncall for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN AND TALBOTT IN REPLY TO GEN. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n“SANGAMON JOURNAL,” SPRINGFIELD, ILL., Oct. 28, 1837.\r\n\r\nIn the Republican of this morning a publication of Gen. Adams’s appears,\r\nin which my name is used quite unreservedly. For this I thank the\r\nGeneral. I thank him because it gives me an opportunity, without\r\nappearing obtrusive, of explaining a part of a former publication of\r\nmine, which appears to me to have been misunderstood by many.\r\n\r\nIn the former publication alluded to, I stated, in substance, that\r\nMr. Talbott got a deed from a son of Gen. Adams’s for the purpose of\r\ncorrecting a mistake that had occurred on the record of the said deed\r\nin the recorder’s office; that he corrected the record, and brought the\r\ndeed and handed it to me, and that on opening the deed, another paper,\r\nbeing the assignment of a judgment, fell out of it. This statement\r\nGen. Adams and the editor of the Republican have seized upon as a most\r\npalpable evidence of fabrication and falsehood. They set themselves\r\ngravely about proving that the assignment could not have been in the\r\ndeed when Talbott got it from young Adams, as he, Talbott, would have\r\nseen it when he opened the deed to correct the record. Now, the truth\r\nis, Talbott did see the assignment when he opened the deed, or at least\r\nhe told me he did on the same day; and I only omitted to say so, in\r\nmy former publication, because it was a matter of such palpable and\r\nnecessary inference. I had stated that Talbott had corrected the record\r\nby the deed; and of course he must have opened it; and, just as the\r\nGeneral and his friends argue, must have seen the assignment. I omitted\r\nto state the fact of Talbott’s seeing the assignment, because its\r\nexistence was so necessarily connected with other facts which I did\r\nstate, that I thought the greatest dunce could not but understand\r\nit. Did I say Talbott had not seen it? Did I say anything that was\r\ninconsistent with his having seen it before? Most certainly I did\r\nneither; and if I did not, what becomes of the argument? These logical\r\ngentlemen can sustain their argument only by assuming that I did say\r\nnegatively everything that I did not say affirmatively; and upon the\r\nsame assumption, we may expect to find the General, if a little harder\r\npressed for argument, saying that I said Talbott came to our office with\r\nhis head downward, not that I actually said so, but because I omitted to\r\nsay he came feet downward.\r\n\r\nIn his publication to-day, the General produces the affidavit of Reuben\r\nRadford, in which it is said that Talbott told Radford that he did not\r\nfind the assignment in the deed, in the recording of which the error\r\nwas committed, but that he found it wrapped in another paper in the\r\nrecorder’s office, upon which statement the Genl. comments as follows,\r\nto wit: “If it be true as stated by Talbott to Radford, that he\r\nfound the assignment wrapped up in another paper at his office, that\r\ncontradicts the statement of Lincoln that it fell out of the deed.”\r\n\r\nIs common sense to be abused with such sophistry? Did I say what Talbott\r\nfound it in? If Talbott did find it in another paper at his office, is\r\nthat any reason why he could not have folded it in a deed and brought\r\nit to my office? Can any one be so far duped as to be made believe that\r\nwhat may have happened at Talbot’s office at one time is inconsistent\r\nwith what happened at my office at another time?\r\n\r\nNow Talbott’s statement of the case as he makes it to me is this, that\r\nhe got a bunch of deeds from young Adams, and that he knows he found the\r\nassignment in the bunch, but he is not certain which particular deed it\r\nwas in, nor is he certain whether it was folded in the same deed out of\r\nwhich it was taken, or another one, when it was brought to my office. Is\r\nthis a mysterious story? Is there anything suspicious about it?\r\n\r\n“But it is useless to dwell longer on this point. Any man who is not\r\nwilfully blind can see at a flash, that there is no discrepancy, and\r\nLincoln has shown that they are not only inconsistent with truth, but\r\neach other”—I can only say, that I have shown that he has done no such\r\nthing; and if the reader is disposed to require any other evidence than\r\nthe General’s assertion, he will be of my opinion.\r\n\r\nExcepting the General’s most flimsy attempt at mystification, in regard\r\nto a discrepance between Talbott and myself, he has not denied a single\r\nstatement that I made in my hand-bill. Every material statement that\r\nI made has been sworn to by men who, in former times, were thought as\r\nrespectable as General Adams. I stated that an assignment of a judgment,\r\na copy of which I gave, had existed—Benj. Talbott, C. R. Matheny, Wm.\r\nButler, and Judge Logan swore to its existence. I stated that it was\r\nsaid to be in Gen. Adams’s handwriting—the same men swore it was in\r\nhis handwriting. I stated that Talbott would swear that he got it out of\r\nGen. Adams’s possession—Talbott came forward and did swear it.\r\n\r\nBidding adieu to the former publication, I now propose to examine the\r\nGeneral’s last gigantic production. I now propose to point out some\r\ndiscrepancies in the General’s address; and such, too, as he shall not\r\nbe able to escape from. Speaking of the famous assignment, the General\r\nsays: “This last charge, which was their last resort, their dying\r\neffort to render my character infamous among my fellow citizens, was\r\nmanufactured at a certain lawyer’s office in the town, printed at the\r\noffice of the Sangamon Journal, and found its way into the world some\r\ntime between two days just before the last election.” Now turn to Mr.\r\nKeys’ affidavit, in which you will find the following, viz.: “I\r\ncertify that some time in May or the early part of June, 1837, I saw\r\nat Williams’s corner a paper purporting to be an assignment from Joseph\r\nAnderson to James Adams, which assignment was signed by a mark to\r\nAnderson’s name,” etc. Now mark, if Keys saw the assignment on the last\r\nof May or first of June, Gen. Adams tells a falsehood when he says\r\nit was manufactured just before the election, which was on the 7th of\r\nAugust; and if it was manufactured just before the election, Keys tells\r\na falsehood when he says he saw it on the last of May or first of\r\nJune. Either Keys or the General is irretrievably in for it; and in the\r\nGeneral’s very condescending language, I say “Let them settle it between\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nNow again, let the reader, bearing in mind that General Adams has\r\nunequivocally said, in one part of his address, that the charge in\r\nrelation to the assignment was manufactured just before the election,\r\nturn to the affidavit of Peter S. Weber, where the following will be\r\nfound viz.: “I, Peter S. Weber, do certify that from the best of\r\nmy recollection, on the day or day after Gen. Adams started for the\r\nIllinois Rapids, in May last, that I was at the house of Gen. Adams,\r\nsitting in the kitchen, situated on the back part of the house, it being\r\nin the afternoon, and that Benjamin Talbott came around the house, back\r\ninto the kitchen, and appeared wild and confused, and that he laid a\r\npackage of papers on the kitchen table and requested that they should be\r\nhanded to Lucian. He made no apology for coming to the kitchen, nor\r\nfor not handing them to Lucian himself, but showed the token of being\r\nfrightened and confused both in demeanor and speech and for what cause I\r\ncould not apprehend.”\r\n\r\nCommenting on Weber’s affidavit, Gen. Adams asks, “Why this fright and\r\nconfusion?” I reply that this is a question for the General himself.\r\nWeber says that it was in May, and if so, it is most clear that Talbott\r\nwas not frightened on account of the assignment, unless the General\r\nlies when he says the assignment charge was manufactured just before the\r\nelection. Is it not a strong evidence, that the General is not traveling\r\nwith the pole-star of truth in his front, to see him in one part of\r\nhis address roundly asserting that the assignment was manufactured\r\njust before the election, and then, forgetting that position, procuring\r\nWeber’s most foolish affidavit, to prove that Talbott had been engaged\r\nin manufacturing it two months before?\r\n\r\nIn another part of his address, Gen. Adams says: “That I hold an\r\nassignment of said judgment, dated the 20th of May, 1828, and signed\r\nby said Anderson, I have never pretended to deny or conceal, but stated\r\nthat fact in one of my circulars previous to the election, and also\r\nin answer to a bill in chancery.” Now I pronounce this statement\r\nunqualifiedly false, and shall not rely on the word or oath of any\r\nman to sustain me in what I say; but will let the whole be decided by\r\nreference to the circular and answer in chancery of which the General\r\nspeaks. In his circular he did speak of an assignment; but he did not\r\nsay it bore date 20th of May, 1828; nor did he say it bore any date. In\r\nhis answer in chancery, he did say that he had an assignment; but he\r\ndid not say that it bore date the 20th May, 1828; but so far from it, he\r\nsaid on oath (for he swore to the answer) that as well as recollected,\r\nhe obtained it in 1827. If any one doubts, let him examine the circular\r\nand answer for himself. They are both accessible.\r\n\r\nIt will readily be observed that the principal part of Adams’s defense\r\nrests upon the argument that if he had been base enough to forge an\r\nassignment he would not have been fool enough to forge one that would\r\nnot cover the case. This argument he used in his circular before the\r\nelection. The Republican has used it at least once, since then; and\r\nAdams uses it again in his publication of to-day. Now I pledge myself to\r\nshow that he is just such a fool that he and his friends have contended\r\nit was impossible for him to be. Recollect—he says he has a genuine\r\nassignment; and that he got Joseph Klein’s affidavit, stating that he\r\nhad seen it, and that he believed the signature to have been executed\r\nby the same hand that signed Anderson’s name to the answer in chancery.\r\nLuckily Klein took a copy of this genuine assignment, which I have been\r\npermitted to see; and hence I know it does not cover the case. In the\r\nfirst place it is headed “Joseph Anderson vs. Joseph Miller,” and heads\r\noff “Judgment in Sangamon Circuit Court.” Now, mark, there never was\r\na case in Sangamon Circuit Court entitled Joseph Anderson vs. Joseph\r\nMiller. The case mentioned in my former publication, and the only\r\none between these parties that ever existed in the Circuit Court, was\r\nentitled Joseph Miller vs. Joseph Anderson, Miller being the plaintiff.\r\nWhat then becomes of all their sophistry about Adams not being fool\r\nenough to forge an assignment that would not cover the case? It is\r\ncertain that the present one does not cover the case; and if he got\r\nit honestly, it is still clear that he was fool enough to pay for an\r\nassignment that does not cover the case.\r\n\r\nThe General asks for the proof of disinterested witnesses. Whom does he\r\nconsider disinterested? None can be more so than those who have already\r\ntestified against him. No one of them had the least interest on earth,\r\nso far as I can learn, to injure him. True, he says they had conspired\r\nagainst him; but if the testimony of an angel from Heaven were\r\nintroduced against him, he would make the same charge of conspiracy.\r\nAnd now I put the question to every reflecting man, Do you believe that\r\nBenjamin Talbott, Chas. R. Matheny, William Butler and Stephen T. Logan,\r\nall sustaining high and spotless characters, and justly proud of them,\r\nwould deliberately perjure themselves, without any motive whatever,\r\nexcept to injure a man’s election; and that, too, a man who had been a\r\ncandidate, time out of mind, and yet who had never been elected to any\r\noffice?\r\n\r\nAdams’s assurance, in demanding disinterested testimony, is surpassing.\r\nHe brings in the affidavit of his own son, and even of Peter S. Weber,\r\nwith whom I am not acquainted, but who, I suppose, is some black or\r\nmulatto boy, from his being kept in the kitchen, to prove his points;\r\nbut when such a man as Talbott, a man who, but two years ago, ran\r\nagainst Gen. Adams for the office of Recorder and beat him more than\r\nfour votes to one, is introduced against him, he asks the community,\r\nwith all the consequence of a lord, to reject his testimony.\r\n\r\nI might easily write a volume, pointing out inconsistencies between\r\nthe statements in Adams’s last address with one another, and with other\r\nknown facts; but I am aware the reader must already be tired with\r\nthe length of this article. His opening statements, that he was first\r\naccused of being a Tory, and that he refuted that; that then the\r\nSampson’s ghost story was got up, and he refuted that; that as a last\r\nresort, a dying effort, the assignment charge was got up is all as false\r\nas hell, as all this community must know. Sampson’s ghost first made\r\nits appearance in print, and that, too, after Keys swears he saw the\r\nassignment, as any one may see by reference to the files of papers; and\r\nGen. Adams himself, in reply to the Sampson’s ghost story, was the first\r\nman that raised the cry of toryism, and it was only by way of set-off,\r\nand never in seriousness, that it was bandied back at him. His effort is\r\nto make the impression that his enemies first made the charge of toryism\r\nand he drove them from that, then Sampson’s ghost, he drove them from\r\nthat, then finally the assignment charge was manufactured just before\r\nelection. Now, the only general reply he ever made to the Sampson’s\r\nghost and tory charges he made at one and the same time, and not in\r\nsuccession as he states; and the date of that reply will show, that it\r\nwas made at least a month after the date on which Keys swears he saw the\r\nAnderson assignment. But enough. In conclusion I will only say that I\r\nhave a character to defend as well as Gen. Adams, but I disdain to whine\r\nabout it as he does. It is true I have no children nor kitchen boys; and\r\nif I had, I should scorn to lug them in to make affidavits for me.\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN, September 6, 1837.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGen. ADAMS CONTROVERSY—CONTINUED\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PUBLIC.\r\n\r\n“SANGAMON JOURNAL,” Springfield, Ill, Oct.28, 1837.\r\n\r\nSuch is the turn which things have taken lately, that when Gen. Adams\r\nwrites a book, I am expected to write a commentary on it. In the\r\nRepublican of this morning he has presented the world with a new work\r\nof six columns in length; in consequence of which I must beg the room of\r\none column in the Journal. It is obvious that a minute reply cannot\r\nbe made in one column to everything that can be said in six; and,\r\nconsequently, I hope that expectation will be answered if I reply to\r\nsuch parts of the General’s publication as are worth replying to.\r\n\r\nIt may not be improper to remind the reader that in his publication of\r\nSept. 6th General Adams said that the assignment charge was manufactured\r\njust before the election; and that in reply I proved that statement to\r\nbe false by Keys, his own witness. Now, without attempting to explain,\r\nhe furnishes me with another witness (Tinsley) by which the same thing\r\nis proved, to wit, that the assignment was not manufactured just before\r\nthe election; but that it was some weeks before. Let it be borne in mind\r\nthat Adams made this statement—has himself furnished two witnesses to\r\nprove its falsehood, and does not attempt to deny or explain it. Before\r\ngoing farther, let a pin be stuck here, labeled “One lie proved and\r\nconfessed.” On the 6th of September he said he had before stated in\r\nthe hand-bill that he held an assignment dated May 20th, 1828, which in\r\nreply I pronounced to be false, and referred to the hand-bill for the\r\ntruth of what I said. This week he forgets to make any explanation of\r\nthis. Let another pin be stuck here, labelled as before. I mention these\r\nthings because, if, when I convict him in one falsehood, he is permitted\r\nto shift his ground and pass it by in silence, there can be no end to\r\nthis controversy.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that attracts my attention in the General’s present\r\nproduction is the information he is pleased to give to “those who are\r\nmade to suffer at his (my) hands.”\r\n\r\nUnder present circumstances, this cannot apply to me, for I am not\r\na widow nor an orphan: nor have I a wife or children who might by\r\npossibility become such. Such, however, I have no doubt, have been,\r\nand will again be made to suffer at his hands! Hands! Yes, they are\r\nthe mischievous agents. The next thing I shall notice is his favorite\r\nexpression, “not of lawyers, doctors and others,” which he is so fond of\r\napplying to all who dare expose his rascality. Now, let it be remembered\r\nthat when he first came to this country he attempted to impose himself\r\nupon the community as a lawyer, and actually carried the attempt so\r\nfar as to induce a man who was under a charge of murder to entrust the\r\ndefence of his life in his hands, and finally took his money and got\r\nhim hanged. Is this the man that is to raise a breeze in his favor by\r\nabusing lawyers? If he is not himself a lawyer, it is for the lack of\r\nsense, and not of inclination. If he is not a lawyer, he is a liar, for\r\nhe proclaimed himself a lawyer, and got a man hanged by depending on\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nPassing over such parts of the article as have neither fact nor argument\r\nin them, I come to the question asked by Adams whether any person ever\r\nsaw the assignment in his possession. This is an insult to common sense.\r\nTalbott has sworn once and repeated time and again, that he got it out\r\nof Adams’s possession and returned it into the same possession. Still,\r\nas though he was addressing fools, he has assurance to ask if any person\r\never saw it in his possession.\r\n\r\nNext I quote a sentence, “Now my son Lucian swears that when Talbott\r\ncalled for the deed, that he, Talbott, opened it and pointed out the\r\nerror.” True. His son Lucian did swear as he says; and in doing so, he\r\nswore what I will prove by his own affidavit to be a falsehood. Turn to\r\nLucian’s affidavit, and you will there see that Talbott called for the\r\ndeed by which to correct an error on the record. Thus it appears that\r\nthe error in question was on the record, and not in the deed. How then\r\ncould Talbott open the deed and point out the error? Where a thing is\r\nnot, it cannot be pointed out. The error was not in the deed, and of\r\ncourse could not be pointed out there. This does not merely prove that\r\nthe error could not be pointed out, as Lucian swore it was; but it\r\nproves, too, that the deed was not opened in his presence with a special\r\nview to the error, for if it had been, he could not have failed to see\r\nthat there was no error in it. It is easy enough to see why Lucian swore\r\nthis. His object was to prove that the assignment was not in the deed\r\nwhen Talbott got it: but it was discovered he could not swear this\r\nsafely, without first swearing the deed was opened—and if he swore it\r\nwas opened, he must show a motive for opening it, and the conclusion\r\nwith him and his father was that the pointing out the error would appear\r\nthe most plausible.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of showing that the assignment was not in the bundle\r\nwhen Talbott got it, is the story introduced into Lucian’s affidavit\r\nthat the deeds were counted. It is a remarkable fact, and one that\r\nshould stand as a warning to all liars and fabricators, that in this\r\nshort affidavit of Lucian’s he only attempted to depart from the truth,\r\nso far as I have the means of knowing, in two points, to wit, in the\r\nopening the deed and pointing out the error and the counting of the\r\ndeeds,—and in both of these he caught himself. About the counting, he\r\ncaught himself thus—after saying the bundle contained five deeds and\r\na lease, he proceeds, “and I saw no other papers than the said deed and\r\nlease.” First he has six papers, and then he saw none but two; for “my\r\nson Lucian’s” benefit, let a pin be stuck here.\r\n\r\nAdams again adduces the argument, that he could not have forged the\r\nassignment, for the reason that he could have had no motive for it. With\r\nthose that know the facts there is no absence of motive. Admitting the\r\npaper which he has filed in the suit to be genuine, it is clear that it\r\ncannot answer the purpose for which he designs it. Hence his motive for\r\nmaking one that he supposed would answer is obvious. His making the date\r\ntoo old is also easily enough accounted for. The records were not in his\r\nhands, and then, there being some considerable talk upon this particular\r\nsubject, he knew he could not examine the records to ascertain the\r\nprecise dates without subjecting himself to suspicion; and hence he\r\nconcluded to try it by guess, and, as it turned out, missed it a little.\r\nAbout Miller’s deposition I have a word to say. In the first place,\r\nMiller’s answer to the first question shows upon its face that he had\r\nbeen tampered with, and the answer dictated to him. He was asked if he\r\nknew Joel Wright and James Adams; and above three-fourths of his answer\r\nconsists of what he knew about Joseph Anderson, a man about whom nothing\r\nhad been asked, nor a word said in the question—a fact that can only be\r\naccounted for upon the supposition that Adams had secretly told him what\r\nhe wished him to swear to.\r\n\r\nAnother of Miller’s answers I will prove both by common sense and the\r\nCourt of Record is untrue. To one question he answers, “Anderson brought\r\na suit against me before James Adams, then an acting justice of the\r\npeace in Sangamon County, before whom he obtained a judgment.\r\n\r\n“Q.—Did you remove the same by injunction to the Sangamon Circuit\r\nCourt? Ans.—I did remove it.”\r\n\r\nNow mark—it is said he removed it by injunction. The word “injunction”\r\nin common language imports a command that some person or thing shall\r\nnot move or be removed; in law it has the same meaning. An injunction\r\nissuing out of chancery to a justice of the peace is a command to him to\r\nstop all proceedings in a named case until further orders. It is not an\r\norder to remove but to stop or stay something that is already moving.\r\nBesides this, the records of the Sangamon Circuit Court show that the\r\njudgment of which Miller swore was never removed into said Court by\r\ninjunction or otherwise.\r\n\r\nI have now to take notice of a part of Adams’s address which in the\r\norder of time should have been noticed before. It is in these words:\r\n“I have now shown, in the opinion of two competent judges, that the\r\nhandwriting of the forged assignment differed from mine, and by one of\r\nthem that it could not be mistaken for mine.” That is false. Tinsley no\r\ndoubt is the judge referred to; and by reference to his certificate it\r\nwill be seen that he did not say the handwriting of the assignment\r\ncould not be mistaken for Adams’s—nor did he use any other expression\r\nsubstantially, or anything near substantially, the same. But if Tinsley\r\nhad said the handwriting could not be mistaken for Adams’s, it would\r\nhave been equally unfortunate for Adams: for it then would have\r\ncontradicted Keys, who says, “I looked at the writing and judged it the\r\nsaid Adams’s or a good imitation.”\r\n\r\nAdams speaks with much apparent confidence of his success on attending\r\nlawsuits, and the ultimate maintenance of his title to the land in\r\nquestion. Without wishing to disturb the pleasure of his dream, I would\r\nsay to him that it is not impossible that he may yet be taught to sing a\r\ndifferent song in relation to the matter.\r\n\r\nAt the end of Miller’s deposition, Adams asks, “Will Mr. Lincoln now say\r\nthat he is almost convinced my title to this ten acre tract of land\r\nis founded in fraud?” I answer, I will not. I will now change the\r\nphraseology so as to make it run—I am quite convinced, &c. I cannot\r\npass in silence Adams’s assertion that he has proved that the forged\r\nassignment was not in the deed when it came from his house by Talbott,\r\nthe recorder. In this, although Talbott has sworn that the assignment\r\nwas in the bundle of deeds when it came from his house, Adams has\r\nthe unaccountable assurance to say that he has proved the contrary by\r\nTalbott. Let him or his friends attempt to show wherein he proved any\r\nsuch thing by Talbott.\r\n\r\nIn his publication of the 6th of September he hinted to Talbott, that\r\nhe might be mistaken. In his present, speaking of Talbott and me he says\r\n“They may have been imposed upon.” Can any man of the least penetration\r\nfail to see the object of this? After he has stormed and raged till he\r\nhopes and imagines he has got us a little scared he wishes to softly\r\nwhisper in our ears, “If you’ll quit I will.” If he could get us to say\r\nthat some unknown, undefined being had slipped the assignment into\r\nour hands without our knowledge, not a doubt remains but that he would\r\nimmediately discover that we were the purest men on earth. This is the\r\nground he evidently wishes us to understand he is willing to compromise\r\nupon. But we ask no such charity at his hands. We are neither mistaken\r\nnor imposed upon. We have made the statements we have because we know\r\nthem to be true and we choose to live or die by them.\r\n\r\nEsq. Carter, who is Adams’s friend, personal and political, will\r\nrecollect, that, on the 5th of this month, he (Adams), with a great\r\naffectation of modesty, declared that he would never introduce his own\r\nchild as a witness. Notwithstanding this affectation of modesty, he has\r\nin his present publication introduced his child as witness; and as if to\r\nshow with how much contempt he could treat his own declaration, he\r\nhas had this same Esq. Carter to administer the oath to him. And so\r\nimportant a witness does he consider him, and so entirely does the whole\r\nof his entire present production depend upon the testimony of his child,\r\nthat in it he has mentioned “my son,” “my son Lucian,” “Lucian, my son,”\r\nand the like expressions no less than fifteen different times. Let it\r\nbe remembered here, that I have shown the affidavit of “my darling son\r\nLucian” to be false by the evidence apparent on its own face; and I now\r\nask if that affidavit be taken away what foundation will the fabric have\r\nleft to stand upon?\r\n\r\nGeneral Adams’s publications and out-door maneuvering, taken in\r\nconnection with the editorial articles of the Republican, are not more\r\nfoolish and contradictory than they are ludicrous and amusing. One\r\nweek the Republican notifies the public that Gen. Adams is preparing\r\nan instrument that will tear, rend, split, rive, blow up, confound,\r\noverwhelm, annihilate, extinguish, exterminate, burst asunder, and grind\r\nto powder all its slanderers, and particularly Talbott and Lincoln—all\r\nof which is to be done in due time.\r\n\r\nThen for two or three weeks all is calm—not a word said. Again the\r\nRepublican comes forth with a mere passing remark that “public” opinion\r\nhas decided in favor of Gen. Adams, and intimates that he will give\r\nhimself no more trouble about the matter. In the meantime Adams himself\r\nis prowling about and, as Burns says of the devil, “For prey, and holes\r\nand corners tryin’,” and in one instance goes so far as to take an old\r\nacquaintance of mine several steps from a crowd and, apparently weighed\r\ndown with the importance of his business, gravely and solemnly asks him\r\nif “he ever heard Lincoln say he was a deist.”\r\n\r\nAnon the Republican comes again. “We invite the attention of the public\r\nto General Adams’s communication,” &c. “The victory is a great one, the\r\ntriumph is overwhelming.” I really believe the editor of the Illinois\r\nRepublican is fool enough to think General Adams leads off—“Authors\r\nmost egregiously mistaken &c. Most woefully shall their presumption be\r\npunished,” &c. (Lord have mercy on us.) “The hour is yet to come, yea,\r\nnigh at hand—(how long first do you reckon?)—when the Journal and its\r\njunto shall say, I have appeared too early.” “Their infamy shall be laid\r\nbare to the public gaze.” Suddenly the General appears to relent at the\r\nseverity with which he is treating us and he exclaims: “The condemnation\r\nof my enemies is the inevitable result of my own defense.” For your\r\nhealth’s sake, dear Gen., do not permit your tenderness of heart to\r\nafflict you so much on our account. For some reason (perhaps because we\r\nare killed so quickly) we shall never be sensible of our suffering.\r\n\r\nFarewell, General. I will see you again at court if not before—when and\r\nwhere we will settle the question whether you or the widow shall have\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN. October 18, 1837.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1838\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO Mrs. O. H. BROWNING—A FARCE\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, April 1, 1838.\r\n\r\nDEAR MADAM:—Without apologizing for being egotistical, I shall make the\r\nhistory of so much of my life as has elapsed since I saw you the subject\r\nof this letter. And, by the way, I now discover that, in order to give\r\na full and intelligible account of the things I have done and suffered\r\nsince I saw you, I shall necessarily have to relate some that happened\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nIt was, then, in the autumn of 1836 that a married lady of my\r\nacquaintance, and who was a great friend of mine, being about to pay a\r\nvisit to her father and other relatives residing in Kentucky, proposed\r\nto me that on her return she would bring a sister of hers with her on\r\ncondition that I would engage to become her brother-in-law with all\r\nconvenient despatch. I, of course, accepted the proposal, for you know\r\nI could not have done otherwise had I really been averse to it; but\r\nprivately, between you and me, I was most confoundedly well pleased with\r\nthe project. I had seen the said sister some three years before, thought\r\nher intelligent and agreeable, and saw no good objection to plodding\r\nlife through hand in hand with her. Time passed on; the lady took her\r\njourney and in due time returned, sister in company, sure enough. This\r\nastonished me a little, for it appeared to me that her coming so readily\r\nshowed that she was a trifle too willing, but on reflection it occurred\r\nto me that she might have been prevailed on by her married sister to\r\ncome without anything concerning me ever having been mentioned to her,\r\nand so I concluded that if no other objection presented itself, I would\r\nconsent to waive this. All this occurred to me on hearing of her arrival\r\nin the neighborhood—for, be it remembered, I had not yet seen her,\r\nexcept about three years previous, as above mentioned. In a few days we\r\nhad an interview, and, although I had seen her before, she did not look\r\nas my imagination had pictured her. I knew she was over-size, but she\r\nnow appeared a fair match for Falstaff. I knew she was called an\r\n“old maid,” and I felt no doubt of the truth of at least half of the\r\nappellation, but now, when I beheld her, I could not for my life avoid\r\nthinking of my mother; and this, not from withered features,—for\r\nher skin was too full of fat to permit of its contracting into\r\nwrinkles,—but from her want of teeth, weather-beaten appearance in\r\ngeneral, and from a kind of notion that ran in my head that nothing\r\ncould have commenced at the size of infancy and reached her present bulk\r\nin less than thirty-five or forty years; and in short, I was not at\r\nall pleased with her. But what could I do? I had told her sister that I\r\nwould take her for better or for worse, and I made a point of honor and\r\nconscience in all things to stick to my word especially if others had\r\nbeen induced to act on it which in this case I had no doubt they had,\r\nfor I was now fairly convinced that no other man on earth would have\r\nher, and hence the conclusion that they were bent on holding me to my\r\nbargain.\r\n\r\n“Well,” thought I, “I have said it, and, be the consequences what they\r\nmay, it shall not be my fault if I fail to do it.” At once I determined\r\nto consider her my wife; and, this done, all my powers of discovery were\r\nput to work in search of perfections in her which might be fairly set\r\noff against her defects. I tried to imagine her handsome, which, but\r\nfor her unfortunate corpulency, was actually true. Exclusive of this no\r\nwoman that I have ever seen has a finer face. I also tried to convince\r\nmyself that the mind was much more to be valued than the person; and in\r\nthis she was not inferior, as I could discover, to any with whom I had\r\nbeen acquainted.\r\n\r\nShortly after this, without coming to any positive understanding with\r\nher, I set out for Vandalia, when and where you first saw me. During\r\nmy stay there I had letters from her which did not change my opinion of\r\neither her intellect or intention, but on the contrary confirmed it in\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nAll this while, although I was fixed, “firm as the surge-repelling\r\nrock,” in my resolution, I found I was continually repenting the\r\nrashness which had led me to make it. Through life, I have been in no\r\nbondage, either real or imaginary, from the thraldom of which I so much\r\ndesired to be free. After my return home, I saw nothing to change my\r\nopinions of her in any particular. She was the same, and so was I. I now\r\nspent my time in planning how I might get along through life after my\r\ncontemplated change of circumstances should have taken place, and how I\r\nmight procrastinate the evil day for a time, which I really dreaded as\r\nmuch, perhaps more, than an Irishman does the halter.\r\n\r\nAfter all my suffering upon this deeply interesting subject, here I am,\r\nwholly, unexpectedly, completely, out of the “scrape”; and now I want to\r\nknow if you can guess how I got out of it——out, clear, in every sense\r\nof the term; no violation of word, honor, or conscience. I don’t believe\r\nyou can guess, and so I might as well tell you at once. As the lawyer\r\nsays, it was done in the manner following, to wit: After I had delayed\r\nthe matter as long as I thought I could in honor do (which, by the way,\r\nhad brought me round into the last fall), I concluded I might as well\r\nbring it to a consummation without further delay; and so I mustered\r\nmy resolution, and made the proposal to her direct; but, shocking to\r\nrelate, she answered, No. At first I supposed she did it through an\r\naffectation of modesty, which I thought but ill became her under the\r\npeculiar circumstances of her case; but on my renewal of the charge,\r\nI found she repelled it with greater firmness than before. I tried it\r\nagain and again but with the same success, or rather with the same want\r\nof success.\r\n\r\nI finally was forced to give it up; at which I very unexpectedly found\r\nmyself mortified almost beyond endurance. I was mortified, it seemed\r\nto me, in a hundred different ways. My vanity was deeply wounded by the\r\nreflection that I had been too stupid to discover her intentions, and at\r\nthe same time never doubting that I understood them perfectly, and also\r\nthat she, whom I had taught myself to believe nobody else would have,\r\nhad actually rejected me with all my fancied greatness. And, to cap the\r\nwhole, I then for the first time began to suspect that I was really a\r\nlittle in love with her. But let it all go. I’ll try and outlive it.\r\nOthers have been made fools of by the girls, but this can never with\r\ntruth be said of me. I most emphatically in this instance, made a fool\r\nof myself. I have now come to the conclusion never again to think of\r\nmarrying, and for this reason: I can never be satisfied with any one who\r\nwould be blockhead enough to have me.\r\n\r\nWhen you receive this, write me a long yarn about something to amuse me.\r\nGive my respects to Mr. Browning.\r\n\r\nYour sincere friend, A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1839\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS ON SALE OF PUBLIC LANDS\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, January 17, 1839.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln, from Committee on Finance, to which the subject was\r\nreferred, made a report on the subject of purchasing of the United\r\nStates all the unsold lands lying within the limits of the State of\r\nIllinois, accompanied by resolutions that this State propose to purchase\r\nall unsold lands at twenty-five cents per acre, and pledging the faith\r\nof the State to carry the proposal into effect if the government accept\r\nthe same within two years.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln thought the resolutions ought to be seriously considered. In\r\nreply to the gentleman from Adams, he said that it was not to enrich the\r\nState. The price of the lands may be raised, it was thought by some; by\r\nothers, that it would be reduced. The conclusion in his mind was that\r\nthe representatives in this Legislature from the country in which\r\nthe lands lie would be opposed to raising the price, because it would\r\noperate against the settlement of the lands. He referred to the lands in\r\nthe military tract. They had fallen into the hands of large speculators\r\nin consequence of the low price. He was opposed to a low price of land.\r\nHe thought it was adverse to the interests of the poor settler, because\r\nspeculators buy them up. He was opposed to a reduction of the price of\r\npublic lands.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln referred to some official documents emanating from Indiana,\r\nand compared the progressive population of the two States. Illinois\r\nhad gained upon that State under the public land system as it is. His\r\nconclusion was that ten years from this time Illinois would have no more\r\npublic land unsold than Indiana now has. He referred also to Ohio. That\r\nState had sold nearly all her public lands. She was but twenty years\r\nahead of us, and as our lands were equally salable—more so, as he\r\nmaintained—we should have no more twenty years from now than she has at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln referred to the canal lands, and supposed that the policy of\r\nthe State would be different in regard to them, if the representatives\r\nfrom that section of country could themselves choose the policy; but the\r\nrepresentatives from other parts of the State had a veto upon it, and\r\nregulated the policy. He thought that if the State had all the lands,\r\nthe policy of the Legislature would be more liberal to all sections.\r\n\r\nHe referred to the policy of the General Government. He thought that\r\nif the national debt had not been paid, the expenses of the government\r\nwould not have doubled, as they had done since that debt was paid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ——— ROW.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, June 11, 1839 DEAR ROW:\r\n\r\nMr. Redman informs me that you wish me to write you the particulars of\r\na conversation between Dr. Felix and myself relative to you. The Dr.\r\novertook me between Rushville and Beardstown.\r\n\r\nHe, after learning that I had lived at Springfield, asked if I was\r\nacquainted with you. I told him I was. He said you had lately been\r\nelected constable in Adams, but that you never would be again. I asked\r\nhim why. He said the people there had found out that you had been\r\nsheriff or deputy sheriff in Sangamon County, and that you came off and\r\nleft your securities to suffer. He then asked me if I did not know such\r\nto be the fact. I told him I did not think you had ever been sheriff or\r\ndeputy sheriff in Sangamon, but that I thought you had been constable. I\r\nfurther told him that if you had left your securities to suffer in that\r\nor any other case, I had never heard of it, and that if it had been so,\r\nI thought I would have heard of it.\r\n\r\nIf the Dr. is telling that I told him anything against you whatever, I\r\nauthorize you to contradict it flatly. We have no news here.\r\n\r\nYour friend, as ever, A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH ON NATIONAL BANK\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE HALL OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, December 20, 1839.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS:—It is peculiarly embarrassing to me to attempt a\r\ncontinuance of the discussion, on this evening, which has been conducted\r\nin this hall on several preceding ones. It is so because on each of\r\nthose evenings there was a much fuller attendance than now, without any\r\nreason for its being so, except the greater interest the community feel\r\nin the speakers who addressed them then than they do in him who is to do\r\nso now. I am, indeed, apprehensive that the few who have attended\r\nhave done so more to spare me mortification than in the hope of being\r\ninterested in anything I may be able to say. This circumstance casts\r\na damp upon my spirits, which I am sure I shall be unable to overcome\r\nduring the evening. But enough of preface.\r\n\r\nThe subject heretofore and now to be discussed is the subtreasury scheme\r\nof the present administration, as a means of collecting, safe-keeping,\r\ntransferring, and disbursing, the revenues of the nation, as contrasted\r\nwith a national bank for the same purposes. Mr. Douglas has said that we\r\n(the Whigs) have not dared to meet them (the Locos) in argument on this\r\nquestion. I protest against this assertion. I assert that we have again\r\nand again, during this discussion, urged facts and arguments against\r\nthe subtreasury which they have neither dared to deny nor attempted to\r\nanswer. But lest some may be led to believe that we really wish to avoid\r\nthe question, I now propose, in my humble way, to urge those arguments\r\nagain; at the same time begging the audience to mark well the positions\r\nI shall take and the proof I shall offer to sustain them, and that they\r\nwill not again permit Mr. Douglas or his friends to escape the force of\r\nthem by a round and groundless assertion that we “dare not meet them in\r\nargument.”\r\n\r\nOf the subtreasury, then, as contrasted with a national bank for the\r\nbefore-enumerated purposes, I lay down the following propositions, to\r\nwit: (1) It will injuriously affect the community by its operation on\r\nthe circulating medium. (2) It will be a more expensive fiscal agent.\r\n(3) It will be a less secure depository of the public money. To show\r\nthe truth of the first proposition, let us take a short review of our\r\ncondition under the operation of a national bank. It was the depository\r\nof the public revenues. Between the collection of those revenues and the\r\ndisbursement of them by the government, the bank was permitted to and\r\ndid actually loan them out to individuals, and hence the large amount of\r\nmoney actually collected for revenue purposes, which by any other\r\nplan would have been idle a great portion of the time, was kept almost\r\nconstantly in circulation. Any person who will reflect that money is\r\nonly valuable while in circulation will readily perceive that any device\r\nwhich will keep the government revenues in constant circulation, instead\r\nof being locked up in idleness, is no inconsiderable advantage. By the\r\nsubtreasury the revenue is to be collected and kept in iron boxes until\r\nthe government wants it for disbursement; thus robbing the people of the\r\nuse of it, while the government does not itself need it, and while the\r\nmoney is performing no nobler office than that of rusting in iron boxes.\r\nThe natural effect of this change of policy, every one will see, is\r\nto reduce the quantity of money in circulation. But, again, by\r\nthe subtreasury scheme the revenue is to be collected in specie. I\r\nanticipate that this will be disputed. I expect to hear it said that\r\nit is not the policy of the administration to collect the revenue\r\nin specie. If it shall, I reply that Mr. Van Buren, in his message\r\nrecommending the subtreasury, expended nearly a column of that document\r\nin an attempt to persuade Congress to provide for the collection of the\r\nrevenue in specie exclusively; and he concludes with these words:\r\n\r\n“It may be safely assumed that no motive of convenience to the citizens\r\nrequires the reception of bank paper.” In addition to this, Mr.\r\nSilas Wright, Senator from New York, and the political, personal and\r\nconfidential friend of Mr. Van Buren, drafted and introduced into the\r\nSenate the first subtreasury bill, and that bill provided for ultimately\r\ncollecting the revenue in specie. It is true, I know, that that clause\r\nwas stricken from the bill, but it was done by the votes of the Whigs,\r\naided by a portion only of the Van Buren senators. No subtreasury\r\nbill has yet become a law, though two or three have been considered by\r\nCongress, some with and some without the specie clause; so that I\r\nadmit there is room for quibbling upon the question of whether the\r\nadministration favor the exclusive specie doctrine or not; but I take it\r\nthat the fact that the President at first urged the specie doctrine,\r\nand that under his recommendation the first bill introduced embraced it,\r\nwarrants us in charging it as the policy of the party until their head\r\nas publicly recants it as he at first espoused it. I repeat, then, that\r\nby the subtreasury the revenue is to be collected in specie. Now mark\r\nwhat the effect of this must be. By all estimates ever made there are\r\nbut between sixty and eighty millions of specie in the United States.\r\nThe expenditures of the Government for the year 1838—the last for which\r\nwe have had the report—were forty millions. Thus it is seen that if the\r\nwhole revenue be collected in specie, it will take more than half of all\r\nthe specie in the nation to do it. By this means more than half of all\r\nthe specie belonging to the fifteen millions of souls who compose the\r\nwhole population of the country is thrown into the hands of the public\r\noffice-holders, and other public creditors comprising in number perhaps\r\nnot more than one quarter of a million, leaving the other fourteen\r\nmillions and three quarters to get along as they best can, with less\r\nthan one half of the specie of the country, and whatever rags and\r\nshinplasters they may be able to put, and keep, in circulation. By\r\nthis means, every office-holder and other public creditor may, and\r\nmost likely will, set up shaver; and a most glorious harvest will the\r\nspecie-men have of it,—each specie-man, upon a fair division, having to\r\nhis share the fleecing of about fifty-nine rag-men. In all candor let me\r\nask, was such a system for benefiting the few at the expense of the many\r\never before devised? And was the sacred name of Democracy ever before\r\nmade to indorse such an enormity against the rights of the people?\r\n\r\nI have already said that the subtreasury will reduce the quantity of\r\nmoney in circulation. This position is strengthened by the recollection\r\nthat the revenue is to be collected in Specie, so that the mere amount\r\nof revenue is not all that is withdrawn, but the amount of paper\r\ncirculation that the forty millions would serve as a basis to is\r\nwithdrawn, which would be in a sound state at least one hundred\r\nmillions. When one hundred millions, or more, of the circulation we\r\nnow have shall be withdrawn, who can contemplate without terror the\r\ndistress, ruin, bankruptcy, and beggary that must follow? The man\r\nwho has purchased any article—say a horse—on credit, at one hundred\r\ndollars, when there are two hundred millions circulating in the country,\r\nif the quantity be reduced to one hundred millions by the arrival of\r\npay-day, will find the horse but sufficient to pay half the debt; and\r\nthe other half must either be paid out of his other means, and thereby\r\nbecome a clear loss to him, or go unpaid, and thereby become a clear\r\nloss to his creditor. What I have here said of a single case of the\r\npurchase of a horse will hold good in every case of a debt existing at\r\nthe time a reduction in the quantity of money occurs, by whomsoever, and\r\nfor whatsoever, it may have been contracted. It may be said that\r\nwhat the debtor loses the creditor gains by this operation; but on\r\nexamination this will be found true only to a very limited extent. It is\r\nmore generally true that all lose by it—the creditor by losing more of\r\nhis debts than he gains by the increased value of those he collects; the\r\ndebtor by either parting with more of his property to pay his debts\r\nthan he received in contracting them, or by entirely breaking up his\r\nbusiness, and thereby being thrown upon the world in idleness.\r\n\r\nThe general distress thus created will, to be sure, be temporary,\r\nbecause, whatever change may occur in the quantity of money in any\r\ncommunity, time will adjust the derangement produced; but while that\r\nadjustment is progressing, all suffer more or less, and very many lose\r\neverything that renders life desirable. Why, then, shall we suffer a\r\nsevere difficulty, even though it be but temporary, unless we receive\r\nsome equivalent for it?\r\n\r\nWhat I have been saying as to the effect produced by a reduction of the\r\nquantity of money relates to the whole country. I now propose to\r\nshow that it would produce a peculiar and permanent hardship upon the\r\ncitizens of those States and Territories in which the public lands lie.\r\nThe land-offices in those States and Territories, as all know, form the\r\ngreat gulf by which all, or nearly all, the money in them is swallowed\r\nup. When the quantity of money shall be reduced, and consequently\r\neverything under individual control brought down in proportion, the\r\nprice of those lands, being fixed by law, will remain as now. Of\r\nnecessity it will follow that the produce or labor that now raises money\r\nsufficient to purchase eighty acres will then raise but sufficient\r\nto purchase forty, or perhaps not that much; and this difficulty and\r\nhardship will last as long, in some degree, as any portion of these\r\nlands shall remain undisposed of. Knowing, as I well do, the difficulty\r\nthat poor people now encounter in procuring homes, I hesitate not to say\r\nthat when the price of the public lands shall be doubled or trebled, or,\r\nwhich is the same thing, produce and labor cut down to one half or one\r\nthird of their present prices, it will be little less than impossible\r\nfor them to procure those homes at all....\r\n\r\nWell, then, what did become of him? (Postmaster General Barry) Why, the\r\nPresident immediately expressed his high disapprobation of his almost\r\nunequaled incapacity and corruption by appointing him to a foreign\r\nmission, with a salary and outfit of $18,000 a year! The party now\r\nattempt to throw Barry off, and to avoid the responsibility of his sins.\r\nDid not the President indorse those sins when, on the very heel of\r\ntheir commission, he appointed their author to the very highest and most\r\nhonorable office in his gift, and which is but a single step behind the\r\nvery goal of American political ambition?\r\n\r\nI return to another of Mr. Douglas’s excuses for the expenditures of\r\n1838, at the same time announcing the pleasing intelligence that this is\r\nthe last one. He says that ten millions of that year’s expenditure was\r\na contingent appropriation, to prosecute an anticipated war with Great\r\nBritain on the Maine boundary question. Few words will settle this.\r\nFirst, that the ten millions appropriated was not made till 1839, and\r\nconsequently could not have been expended in 1838; second, although it\r\nwas appropriated, it has never been expended at all. Those who heard Mr.\r\nDouglas recollect that he indulged himself in a contemptuous expression\r\nof pity for me. “Now he’s got me,” thought I. But when he went on to\r\nsay that five millions of the expenditure of 1838 were payments of the\r\nFrench indemnities, which I knew to be untrue; that five millions had\r\nbeen for the post-office, which I knew to be untrue; that ten millions\r\nhad been for the Maine boundary war, which I not only knew to be untrue,\r\nbut supremely ridiculous also; and when I saw that he was stupid enough\r\nto hope that I would permit such groundless and audacious assertions to\r\ngo unexposed,—I readily consented that, on the score both of veracity\r\nand sagacity, the audience should judge whether he or I were the more\r\ndeserving of the world’s contempt.\r\n\r\nMr. Lamborn insists that the difference between the Van Buren party and\r\nthe Whigs is that, although the former sometimes err in practice,\r\nthey are always correct in principle, whereas the latter are wrong in\r\nprinciple; and, better to impress this proposition, he uses a figurative\r\nexpression in these words: “The Democrats are vulnerable in the heel,\r\nbut they are sound in the head and the heart.” The first branch of the\r\nfigure—that is, that the Democrats are vulnerable in the heel—I admit\r\nis not merely figuratively, but literally true. Who that looks but for\r\na moment at their Swartwouts, their Prices, their Harringtons, and their\r\nhundreds of others, scampering away with the public money to Texas, to\r\nEurope, and to every spot of the earth where a villain may hope to find\r\nrefuge from justice, can at all doubt that they are most distressingly\r\naffected in their heels with a species of “running itch”? It seems\r\nthat this malady of their heels operates on these sound-headed and\r\nhonest-hearted creatures very much like the cork leg in the comic song\r\ndid on its owner: which, when he had once got started on it, the more he\r\ntried to stop it, the more it would run away. At the hazard of wearing\r\nthis point threadbare, I will relate an anecdote which seems too\r\nstrikingly in point to be omitted. A witty Irish soldier, who was always\r\nboasting of his bravery when no danger was near, but who invariably\r\nretreated without orders at the first charge of an engagement, being\r\nasked by his captain why he did so, replied: “Captain, I have as brave a\r\nheart as Julius Caesar ever had; but, somehow or other, whenever\r\ndanger approaches, my cowardly legs will run away with it.” So with Mr.\r\nLamborn’s party. They take the public money into their hand for the\r\nmost laudable purpose that wise heads and honest hearts can dictate; but\r\nbefore they can possibly get it out again, their rascally “vulnerable\r\nheels” will run away with them.\r\n\r\nSeriously this proposition of Mr. Lamborn is nothing more or less than\r\na request that his party may be tried by their professions instead of\r\ntheir practices. Perhaps no position that the party assumes is more\r\nliable to or more deserving of exposure than this very modest request;\r\nand nothing but the unwarrantable length to which I have already\r\nextended these remarks forbids me now attempting to expose it. For the\r\nreason given, I pass it by.\r\n\r\nI shall advert to but one more point. Mr. Lamborn refers to the late\r\nelections in the States, and from their results confidently predicts\r\nthat every State in the Union will vote for Mr. Van Buren at the next\r\nPresidential election. Address that argument to cowards and to knaves;\r\nwith the free and the brave it will effect nothing. It may be true; if\r\nit must, let it. Many free countries have lost their liberty, and ours\r\nmay lose hers; but if she shall, be it my proudest plume, not that I was\r\nthe last to desert, but that I never deserted her. I know that the great\r\nvolcano at Washington, aroused and directed by the evil spirit that\r\nreigns there, is belching forth the lava of political corruption in a\r\ncurrent broad and deep, which is sweeping with frightful velocity\r\nover the whole length and breadth of the land, bidding fair to leave\r\nunscathed no green spot or living thing; while on its bosom are riding,\r\nlike demons on the waves of hell, the imps of that evil spirit, and\r\nfiendishly taunting all those who dare resist its destroying course with\r\nthe hopelessness of their effort; and, knowing this, I cannot deny that\r\nall may be swept away. Broken by it I, too, may be; bow to it I never\r\nwill. The probability that we may fall in the struggle ought not to\r\ndeter us from the support of a cause we believe to be just; it shall not\r\ndeter me. If ever I feel the soul within me elevate and expand to those\r\ndimensions not wholly unworthy of its almighty Architect, it is when I\r\ncontemplate the cause of my country deserted by all the world beside,\r\nand I standing up boldly and alone, and hurling defiance at her\r\nvictorious oppressors. Here, without contemplating consequences, before\r\nhigh heaven and in the face of the world, I swear eternal fidelity to\r\nthe just cause, as I deem it, of the land of my life, my liberty, and\r\nmy love. And who that thinks with me will not fearlessly adopt the oath\r\nthat I take? Let none falter who thinks he is right, and we may succeed.\r\nBut if, after all, we shall fail, be it so. We still shall have the\r\nproud consolation of saying to our consciences, and to the departed\r\nshade of our country’s freedom, that the cause approved of our judgment,\r\nand adored of our hearts, in disaster, in chains, in torture, in death,\r\nwe never faltered in defending.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN T. STUART.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, December 23, 1839.\r\n\r\nDEAR STUART:\r\n\r\nDr. Henry will write you all the political news. I write this about some\r\nlittle matters of business. You recollect you told me you had drawn the\r\nChicago Masark money, and sent it to the claimants. A hawk-billed Yankee\r\nis here besetting me at every turn I take, saying that Robert Kinzie\r\nnever received the eighty dollars to which he was entitled. Can you tell\r\nme anything about the matter? Again, old Mr. Wright, who lives up South\r\nFork somewhere, is teasing me continually about some deeds which he says\r\nhe left with you, but which I can find nothing of. Can you tell me where\r\nthey are? The Legislature is in session and has suffered the bank to\r\nforfeit its charter without benefit of clergy. There seems to be little\r\ndisposition to resuscitate it.\r\n\r\nWhenever a letter comes from you to Mrs.____________ I carry it to her,\r\nand then I see Betty; she is a tolerable nice “fellow” now. Maybe I will\r\nwrite again when I get more time.\r\n\r\nYour friend as ever, A. LINCOLN\r\n\r\nP. S.—The Democratic giant is here, but he is not much worth talking\r\nabout. A.L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1840\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCULAR FROM WHIG COMMITTEE.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfidential.\r\n\r\nJanuary [1?], 1840.\r\n\r\nTo MESSRS ———\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:—In obedience to a resolution of the Whig State convention,\r\nwe have appointed you the Central Whig Committee of your county. The\r\ntrust confided to you will be one of watchfulness and labor; but we hope\r\nthe glory of having contributed to the overthrow of the corrupt powers\r\nthat now control our beloved country will be a sufficient reward for the\r\ntime and labor you will devote to it. Our Whig brethren throughout the\r\nUnion have met in convention, and after due deliberation and\r\nmutual concessions have elected candidates for the Presidency and\r\nVice-Presidency not only worthy of our cause, but worthy of the support\r\nof every true patriot who would have our country redeemed, and her\r\ninstitutions honestly and faithfully administered. To overthrow the\r\ntrained bands that are opposed to us whose salaried officers are ever\r\non the watch, and whose misguided followers are ever ready to obey their\r\nsmallest commands, every Whig must not only know his duty, but must\r\nfirmly resolve, whatever of time and labor it may cost, boldly and\r\nfaithfully to do it. Our intention is to organize the whole State, so\r\nthat every Whig can be brought to the polls in the coming Presidential\r\ncontest. We cannot do this, however, without your co-operation; and\r\nas we do our duty, so we shall expect you to do yours. After due\r\ndeliberation, the following is the plan of organization, and the duties\r\nrequired of each county committee:\r\n\r\n(1) To divide their county into small districts, and to appoint in each\r\na subcommittee, whose duty it shall be to make a perfect list of all the\r\nvoters in their respective districts, and to ascertain with certainty\r\nfor whom they will vote. If they meet with men who are doubtful as to\r\nthe man they will support, such voters should be designated in separate\r\nlines, with the name of the man they will probably support.\r\n\r\n(2) It will be the duty of said subcommittee to keep a constant watch on\r\nthe doubtful voters, and from time to time have them talked to by those\r\nin whom they have the most confidence, and also to place in their hands\r\nsuch documents as will enlighten and influence them.\r\n\r\n(3) It will also be their duty to report to you, at least once a month,\r\nthe progress they are making, and on election days see that every Whig\r\nis brought to the polls.\r\n\r\n(4) The subcommittees should be appointed immediately; and by the last\r\nof April, at least, they should make their first report.\r\n\r\n(5) On the first of each month hereafter we shall expect to hear from\r\nyou. After the first report of your subcommittees, unless there should\r\nbe found a great many doubtful voters, you can tell pretty accurately\r\nthe manner in which your county will vote. In each of your letters to\r\nus, you will state the number of certain votes both for and against us,\r\nas well as the number of doubtful votes, with your opinion of the manner\r\nin which they will be cast.\r\n\r\n(6) When we have heard from all the counties, we shall be able to\r\ntell with similar accuracy the political complexion of the State. This\r\ninformation will be forwarded to you as soon as received.\r\n\r\n(7) Inclosed is a prospectus for a newspaper to be continued until after\r\nthe Presidential election. It will be superintended by ourselves, and\r\nevery Whig in the State must take it. It will be published so low that\r\nevery one can afford it. You must raise a fund and forward us for extra\r\ncopies,—every county ought to send—fifty or one hundred dollars,—and\r\nthe copies will be forwarded to you for distribution among our political\r\nopponents. The paper will be devoted exclusively to the great cause\r\nin which we are engaged. Procure subscriptions, and forward them to us\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n(8) Immediately after any election in your county, you must inform us of\r\nits results; and as early as possible after any general election we will\r\ngive you the like information.\r\n\r\n(9) A senator in Congress is to be elected by our next Legislature. Let\r\nno local interests divide you, but select candidates that can succeed.\r\n\r\n(10) Our plan of operations will of course be concealed from every one\r\nexcept our good friends who of right ought to know them.\r\n\r\nTrusting much in our good cause, the strength of our candidates, and\r\nthe determination of the Whigs everywhere to do their duty, we go to\r\nthe work of organization in this State confident of success. We have\r\nthe numbers, and if properly organized and exerted, with the gallant\r\nHarrison at our head, we shall meet our foes and conquer them in all\r\nparts of the Union.\r\n\r\nAddress your letters to Dr. A. G. Henry, R. F, Barrett; A. Lincoln, E.\r\nD. Baker, J. F. Speed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN T. STUART.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, March 1, 1840\r\n\r\nDEAR STUART:\r\n\r\nI have never seen the prospects of our party so bright in these parts\r\nas they are now. We shall carry this county by a larger majority than\r\nwe did in 1836, when you ran against May. I do not think my prospects,\r\nindividually, are very flattering, for I think it probable I shall\r\nnot be permitted to be a candidate; but the party ticket will succeed\r\ntriumphantly. Subscriptions to the “Old Soldier” pour in without\r\nabatement. This morning I took from the post office a letter from Dubois\r\nenclosing the names of sixty subscribers, and on carrying it to Francis\r\nI found he had received one hundred and forty more from other quarters\r\nby the same day’s mail. That is but an average specimen of every day’s\r\nreceipts. Yesterday Douglas, having chosen to consider himself insulted\r\nby something in the Journal, undertook to cane Francis in the street.\r\nFrancis caught him by the hair and jammed him back against a market cart\r\nwhere the matter ended by Francis being pulled away from him. The\r\nwhole affair was so ludicrous that Francis and everybody else (Douglass\r\nexcepted) have been laughing about it ever since.\r\n\r\nI send you the names of some of the V.B. men who have come out for\r\nHarrison about town, and suggest that you send them some documents.\r\n\r\nMoses Coffman (he let us appoint him a delegate yesterday), Aaron\r\nCoffman, George Gregory, H.

LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESOLUTION IN THE ILLINOIS LEGISLATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovember 28, 1840.\r\n\r\nIn the Illinois House of Representatives, November 28, 1840, Mr. Lincoln\r\noffered the following:\r\n\r\nResolved, That so much of the governor’s message as relates to\r\nfraudulent voting, and other fraudulent practices at elections, be\r\nreferred to the Committee on Elections, with instructions to said\r\ncommittee to prepare and report to the House a bill for such an act as\r\nmay in their judgment afford the greatest possible protection of the\r\nelective franchise against all frauds of all sorts whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESOLUTION IN THE ILLINOIS LEGISLATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDecember 2, 1840.\r\n\r\nResolved, That the Committee on Education be instructed to inquire\r\ninto the expediency of providing by law for the examination as to the\r\nqualification of persons offering themselves as school teachers, that no\r\nteacher shall receive any part of the public school fund who shall not\r\nhave successfully passed such examination, and that they report by bill\r\nor otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS IN THE ILLINOIS LEGISLATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDecember 4, 1840\r\n\r\nIn the House of Representatives, Illinois, December 4, 1840, on\r\npresentation of a report respecting petition of H. N. Purple, claiming\r\nthe seat of Mr. Phelps from Peoria, Mr. Lincoln moved that the House\r\nresolve itself into Committee of the Whole on the question, and take\r\nit up immediately. Mr. Lincoln considered the question of the highest\r\nimportance whether an individual had a right to sit in this House or\r\nnot. The course he should propose would be to take up the evidence and\r\ndecide upon the facts seriatim.\r\n\r\nMr. Drummond wanted time; they could not decide in the heat of debate,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln thought that the question had better be gone into now.\r\nIn courts of law jurors were required to decide on evidence, without\r\nprevious study or examination. They were required to know nothing of\r\nthe subject until the evidence was laid before them for their immediate\r\ndecision. He thought that the heat of party would be augmented by delay.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker called Mr. Lincoln to order as being irrelevant; no mention\r\nhad been made of party heat.\r\n\r\nMr. Drummond said he had only spoken of debate. Mr. Lincoln asked what\r\ncaused the heat, if it was not party? Mr. Lincoln concluded by urging\r\nthat the question would be decided now better than hereafter, and he\r\nthought with less heat and excitement.\r\n\r\n(Further debate, in which Lincoln participated.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS IN THE ILLINOIS LEGISLATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDecember 4, 1840.\r\n\r\nIn the Illinois House of Representatives, December 4, 1840, House in\r\nCommittee of the Whole on the bill providing for payment of interest on\r\nthe State debt,—Mr. Lincoln moved to strike out the body and amendments\r\nof the bill, and insert in lieu thereof an amendment which in substance\r\nwas that the governor be authorized to issue bonds for the payment of\r\nthe interest; that these be called “interest bonds”; that the taxes\r\naccruing on Congress lands as they become taxable be irrevocably set\r\naside and devoted as a fund to the payment of the interest bonds. Mr.\r\nLincoln went into the reasons which appeared to him to render this plan\r\npreferable to that of hypothecating the State bonds. By this course we\r\ncould get along till the next meeting of the Legislature, which was\r\nof great importance. To the objection which might be urged that these\r\ninterest bonds could not be cashed, he replied that if our other bonds\r\ncould, much more could these, which offered a perfect security, a fund\r\nbeing irrevocably set aside to provide for their redemption. To another\r\nobjection, that we should be paying compound interest, he would reply\r\nthat the rapid growth and increase of our resources was in so great a\r\nratio as to outstrip the difficulty; that his object was to do the best\r\nthat could be done in the present emergency. All agreed that the faith\r\nof the State must be preserved; this plan appeared to him preferable\r\nto a hypothecation of bonds, which would have to be redeemed and the\r\ninterest paid. How this was to be done, he could not see; therefore he\r\nhad, after turning the matter over in every way, devised this measure,\r\nwhich would carry us on till the next Legislature.\r\n\r\n(Mr. Lincoln spoke at some length, advocating his measure.)\r\n\r\nLincoln advocated his measure, December 11, 1840.\r\n\r\nDecember 12, 1840, he had thought some permanent provision ought to be\r\nmade for the bonds to be hypothecated, but was satisfied taxation and\r\nrevenue could not be connected with it now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1841\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN T. STUART—ON DEPRESSION\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Jan 23, 1841\r\n\r\nDEAR STUART: I am now the most miserable man living. If what I feel were\r\nequally distributed to the whole human family, there would not be one\r\ncheerful face on earth. Whether I shall ever be better, I cannot tell; I\r\nawfully forbode I shall not. To remain as I am is impossible. I must die\r\nor be better, as it appears to me.... I fear I shall be unable to attend\r\nany business here, and a change of scene might help me. If I could be\r\nmyself, I would rather remain at home with Judge Logan. I can write no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS IN THE ILLINOIS LEGISLATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary 23, 1841\r\n\r\nIn the House of Representatives January 23, 1841, while discussing the\r\ncontinuation of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, Mr. Moore was afraid\r\nthe holders of the “scrip” would lose.\r\n\r\nMr. Napier thought there was no danger of that; and Mr. Lincoln said he\r\nhad not examined to see what amount of scrip would probably be needed.\r\nThe principal point in his mind was this, that nobody was obliged to\r\ntake these certificates. It is altogether voluntary on their part, and\r\nif they apprehend it will fall in their hands they will not take it.\r\nFurther the loss, if any there be, will fall on the citizens of that\r\nsection of the country.\r\n\r\nThis scrip is not going to circulate over an extensive range of country,\r\nbut will be confined chiefly to the vicinity of the canal. Now, we find\r\nthe representatives of that section of the country are all in favor of\r\nthe bill.\r\n\r\nWhen we propose to protect their interests, they say to us: Leave us\r\nto take care of ourselves; we are willing to run the risk. And this\r\nis reasonable; we must suppose they are competent to protect their own\r\ninterests, and it is only fair to let them do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCULAR FROM WHIG COMMITTEE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFebruary 9, 1841.\r\n\r\nAppeal to the People of the State of Illinois.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS:—When the General Assembly, now about adjourning,\r\nassembled in November last, from the bankrupt state of the public\r\ntreasury, the pecuniary embarrassments prevailing in every department\r\nof society, the dilapidated state of the public works, and the impending\r\ndanger of the degradation of the State, you had a right to expect\r\nthat your representatives would lose no time in devising and adopting\r\nmeasures to avert threatened calamities, alleviate the distresses of\r\nthe people, and allay the fearful apprehensions in regard to the future\r\nprosperity of the State. It was not expected by you that the spirit of\r\nparty would take the lead in the councils of the State, and make every\r\ninterest bend to its demands. Nor was it expected that any party would\r\nassume to itself the entire control of legislation, and convert the\r\nmeans and offices of the State, and the substance of the people, into\r\naliment for party subsistence. Neither could it have been expected by\r\nyou that party spirit, however strong its desires and unreasonable\r\nits demands, would have passed the sanctuary of the Constitution, and\r\nentered with its unhallowed and hideous form into the formation of the\r\njudiciary system.\r\n\r\nAt the early period of the session, measures were adopted by the\r\ndominant party to take possession of the State, to fill all public\r\noffices with party men, and make every measure affecting the interests\r\nof the people and the credit of the State operate in furtherance of\r\ntheir party views. The merits of men and measures therefore became the\r\nsubject of discussion in caucus, instead of the halls of legislation,\r\nand decisions there made by a minority of the Legislature have been\r\nexecuted and carried into effect by the force of party discipline,\r\nwithout any regard whatever to the rights of the people or the interests\r\nof the State. The Supreme Court of the State was organized, and judges\r\nappointed, according to the provisions of the Constitution, in 1824.\r\nThe people have never complained of the organization of that court; no\r\nattempt has ever before been made to change that department. Respect for\r\npublic opinion, and regard for the rights and liberties of the people,\r\nhave hitherto restrained the spirit of party from attacks upon the\r\nindependence and integrity of the judiciary. The same judges have\r\ncontinued in office since 1824; their decisions have not been the\r\nsubject of complaint among the people; the integrity and honesty of the\r\ncourt have not been questioned, and it has never been supposed that\r\nthe court has ever permitted party prejudice or party considerations\r\nto operate upon their decisions. The court was made to consist of four\r\njudges, and by the Constitution two form a quorum for the transaction\r\nof business. With this tribunal, thus constituted, the people have\r\nbeen satisfied for near sixteen years. The same law which organized the\r\nSupreme Court in 1824 also established and organized circuit courts\r\nto be held in each county in the State, and five circuit judges were\r\nappointed to hold those courts. In 1826 the Legislature abolished these\r\ncircuit courts, repealed the judges out of office, and required the\r\njudges of the Supreme Court to hold the circuit courts. The reasons\r\nassigned for this change were, first, that the business of the country\r\ncould be better attended to by the four judges of the Supreme Court than\r\nby the two sets of judges; and, second, the state of the public treasury\r\nforbade the employment of unnecessary officers. In 1828 a circuit was\r\nestablished north of the Illinois River, in order to meet the wants of\r\nthe people, and a circuit judge was appointed to hold the courts in that\r\ncircuit.\r\n\r\nIn 1834 the circuit-court system was again established throughout the\r\nState, circuit judges appointed to hold the courts, and the judges of\r\nthe Supreme Court were relieved from the performance of circuit court\r\nduties. The change was recommended by the then acting governor of the\r\nState, General W. L. D. Ewing, in the following terms:\r\n\r\n“The augmented population of the State, the multiplied number of\r\norganized counties, as well as the increase of business in all, has\r\nlong since convinced every one conversant with this department of\r\nour government of the indispensable necessity of an alteration in\r\nour judiciary system, and the subject is therefore recommended to the\r\nearnest patriotic consideration of the Legislature. The present system\r\nhas never been exempt from serious and weighty objections. The idea of\r\nappealing from the circuit court to the same judges in the Supreme Court\r\nis recommended by little hopes of redress to the injured party below.\r\nThe duties of the circuit, too, it may be added, consume one half of the\r\nyear, leaving a small and inadequate portion of time (when that required\r\nfor domestic purposes is deducted) to erect, in the decisions of the\r\nSupreme Court, a judicial monument of legal learning and research,\r\nwhich the talent and ability of the court might otherwise be entirely\r\ncompetent to.”\r\n\r\nWith this organization of circuit courts the people have never\r\ncomplained. The only complaints which we have heard have come from\r\ncircuits which were so large that the judges could not dispose of the\r\nbusiness, and the circuits in which Judges Pearson and Ralston lately\r\npresided.\r\n\r\nWhilst the honor and credit of the State demanded legislation upon the\r\nsubject of the public debt, the canal, the unfinished public works, and\r\nthe embarrassments of the people, the judiciary stood upon a basis\r\nwhich required no change—no legislative action. Yet the party in power,\r\nneglecting every interest requiring legislative action, and wholly\r\ndisregarding the rights, wishes, and interests of the people, has, for\r\nthe unholy purpose of providing places for its partisans and supplying\r\nthem with large salaries, disorganized that department of the\r\ngovernment. Provision is made for the election of five party judges\r\nof the Supreme Court, the proscription of four circuit judges, and the\r\nappointment of party clerks in more than half the counties of the\r\nState. Men professing respect for public opinion, and acknowledged to be\r\nleaders of the party, have avowed in the halls of legislation that\r\nthe change in the judiciary was intended to produce political results\r\nfavorable to their party and party friends. The immutable principles\r\nof justice are to make way for party interests, and the bonds of social\r\norder are to be rent in twain, in order that a desperate faction may\r\nbe sustained at the expense of the people. The change proposed in the\r\njudiciary was supported upon grounds so destructive to the institutions\r\nof the country, and so entirely at war with the rights and liberties\r\nof the people, that the party could not secure entire unanimity in its\r\nsupport, three Democrats of the Senate and five of the House voting\r\nagainst the measure. They were unwilling to see the temples of justice\r\nand the seats of independent judges occupied by the tools of faction.\r\nThe declarations of the party leaders, the selection of party men for\r\njudges, and the total disregard for the public will in the adoption of\r\nthe measure, prove conclusively that the object has been not reform, but\r\ndestruction; not the advancement of the highest interests of the State,\r\nbut the predominance of party.\r\n\r\nWe cannot in this manner undertake to point out all the objections to\r\nthis party measure; we present you with those stated by the Council\r\nof Revision upon returning the bill, and we ask for them a candid\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nBelieving that the independence of the judiciary has been destroyed,\r\nthat hereafter our courts will be independent of the people, and\r\nentirely dependent upon the Legislature; that our rights of property\r\nand liberty of conscience can no longer be regarded as safe from the\r\nencroachments of unconstitutional legislation; and knowing of no other\r\nremedy which can be adopted consistently with the peace and good order\r\nof society, we call upon you to avail yourselves of the opportunity\r\nafforded, and, at the next general election, vote for a convention of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n   S.

(2) It is a fatal blow at the independence\r\nof the judges and the constitutional term of their office. (3) It is a\r\nmeasure not asked for, or wished for, by the people. (4) It will greatly\r\nincrease the expense of our courts, or else greatly diminish their\r\nutility. (5) It will give our courts a political and partisan character,\r\nthereby impairing public confidence in their decisions. (6) It will\r\nimpair our standing with other States and the world. (7)It is a party\r\nmeasure for party purposes, from which no practical good to the people\r\ncan possibly arise, but which may be the source of immeasurable evils.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned are well aware that this protest will be altogether\r\nunavailing with the majority of this body. The blow has already fallen,\r\nand we are compelled to stand by, the mournful spectators of the ruin it\r\nwill cause.\r\n\r\n[Signed by 35 members, among whom was Abraham Lincoln.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSHUA F. SPEED—MURDER CASE\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD June 19, 1841.\r\n\r\nDEAR SPEED:—We have had the highest state of excitement here for a week\r\npast that our community has ever witnessed; and, although the public\r\nfeeling is somewhat allayed, the curious affair which aroused it is very\r\nfar from being even yet cleared of mystery. It would take a quire of\r\npaper to give you anything like a full account of it, and I therefore\r\nonly propose a brief outline. The chief personages in the drama are\r\nArchibald Fisher, supposed to be murdered, and Archibald Trailor, Henry\r\nTrailor, and William Trailor, supposed to have murdered him. The three\r\nTrailors are brothers: the first, Arch., as you know, lives in town;\r\nthe second, Henry, in Clary’s Grove; and the third, William, in Warren\r\nCounty; and Fisher, the supposed murdered, being without a family, had\r\nmade his home with William. On Saturday evening, being the 29th of May,\r\nFisher and William came to Henry’s in a one-horse dearborn, and there\r\nstayed over Sunday; and on Monday all three came to Springfield (Henry\r\non horseback) and joined Archibald at Myers’s, the Dutch carpenter.\r\nThat evening at supper Fisher was missing, and so next morning some\r\nineffectual search was made for him; and on Tuesday, at one o’clock\r\nP.M., William and Henry started home without him. In a day or two Henry\r\nand one or two of his Clary-Grove neighbors came back for him again, and\r\nadvertised his disappearance in the papers. The knowledge of the matter\r\nthus far had not been general, and here it dropped entirely, till about\r\nthe 10th instant, when Keys received a letter from the postmaster in\r\nWarren County, that William had arrived at home, and was telling a very\r\nmysterious and improbable story about the disappearance of Fisher, which\r\ninduced the community there to suppose he had been disposed of unfairly.\r\nKeys made this letter public, which immediately set the whole town and\r\nadjoining county agog. And so it has continued until yesterday. The mass\r\nof the people commenced a systematic search for the dead body, while\r\nWickersham was despatched to arrest Henry Trailor at the Grove, and Jim\r\nMaxcy to Warren to arrest William. On Monday last, Henry was brought in,\r\nand showed an evident inclination to insinuate that he knew Fisher to be\r\ndead, and that Arch. and William had killed him. He said he guessed the\r\nbody could be found in Spring Creek, between the Beardstown road and\r\nHickox’s mill. Away the people swept like a herd of buffalo, and cut\r\ndown Hickox’s mill-dam nolens volens, to draw the water out of the pond,\r\nand then went up and down and down and up the creek, fishing and raking,\r\nand raking and ducking and diving for two days, and, after all, no dead\r\nbody found.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime a sort of scuffling-ground had been found in the brush\r\nin the angle, or point, where the road leading into the woods past\r\nthe brewery and the one leading in past the brick-yard meet. From the\r\nscuffle-ground was the sign of something about the size of a man having\r\nbeen dragged to the edge of the thicket, where it joined the track\r\nof some small-wheeled carriage drawn by one horse, as shown by the\r\nroad-tracks. The carriage-track led off toward Spring Creek. Near this\r\ndrag-trail Dr. Merryman found two hairs, which, after a long scientific\r\nexamination, he pronounced to be triangular human hairs, which term, he\r\nsays, includes within it the whiskers, the hair growing under the arms\r\nand on other parts of the body; and he judged that these two were of the\r\nwhiskers, because the ends were cut, showing that they had flourished in\r\nthe neighborhood of the razor’s operations. On Thursday last Jim Maxcy\r\nbrought in William Trailor from Warren. On the same day Arch. was\r\narrested and put in jail. Yesterday (Friday) William was put upon his\r\nexamining trial before May and Lovely. Archibald and Henry were both\r\npresent. Lamborn prosecuted, and Logan, Baker, and your humble servant\r\ndefended. A great many witnesses were introduced and examined, but I\r\nshall only mention those whose testimony seemed most important. The\r\nfirst of these was Captain Ransdell. He swore that when William and\r\nHenry left Springfield for home on Tuesday before mentioned they did not\r\ntake the direct route,—which, you know, leads by the butcher shop,—but\r\nthat they followed the street north until they got opposite, or nearly\r\nopposite, May’s new house, after which he could not see them from where\r\nhe stood; and it was afterwards proved that in about an hour after they\r\nstarted, they came into the street by the butcher shop from toward the\r\nbrickyard. Dr. Merryman and others swore to what is stated about the\r\nscuffle-ground, drag-trail, whiskers, and carriage tracks. Henry was\r\nthen introduced by the prosecution. He swore that when they started for\r\nhome they went out north, as Ransdell stated, and turned down west\r\nby the brick-yard into the woods, and there met Archibald; that they\r\nproceeded a small distance farther, when he was placed as a sentinel to\r\nwatch for and announce the approach of any one that might happen that\r\nway; that William and Arch. took the dearborn out of the road a small\r\ndistance to the edge of the thicket, where they stopped, and he saw\r\nthem lift the body of a man into it; that they then moved off with the\r\ncarriage in the direction of Hickox’s mill, and he loitered about for\r\nsomething like an hour, when William returned with the carriage, but\r\nwithout Arch., and said they had put him in a safe place; that they went\r\nsomehow he did not know exactly how—into the road close to the brewery,\r\nand proceeded on to Clary’s Grove. He also stated that some time during\r\nthe day William told him that he and Arch. had killed Fisher the evening\r\nbefore; that the way they did it was by him William knocking him down\r\nwith a club, and Arch. then choking him to death.\r\n\r\nAn old man from Warren, called Dr. Gilmore, was then introduced on\r\nthe part of the defense. He swore that he had known Fisher for several\r\nyears; that Fisher had resided at his house a long time at each of two\r\ndifferent spells—once while he built a barn for him, and once while\r\nhe was doctored for some chronic disease; that two or three years ago\r\nFisher had a serious hurt in his head by the bursting of a gun, since\r\nwhich he had been subject to continued bad health and occasional\r\naberration of mind. He also stated that on last Tuesday, being the same\r\nday that Maxcy arrested William Trailor, he (the doctor) was from home\r\nin the early part of the day, and on his return, about eleven o’clock,\r\nfound Fisher at his house in bed, and apparently very unwell; that he\r\nasked him how he came from Springfield; that Fisher said he had come by\r\nPeoria, and also told of several other places he had been at more in the\r\ndirection of Peoria, which showed that he at the time of speaking did\r\nnot know where he had been wandering about in a state of derangement.\r\nHe further stated that in about two hours he received a note from one of\r\nTrailor’s friends, advising him of his arrest, and requesting him to go\r\non to Springfield as a witness, to testify as to the state of Fisher’s\r\nhealth in former times; that he immediately set off, calling up two\r\nof his neighbors as company, and, riding all evening and all night,\r\novertook Maxcy and William at Lewiston in Fulton County; that Maxcy\r\nrefusing to discharge Trailor upon his statement, his two neighbors\r\nreturned and he came on to Springfield. Some question being made as to\r\nwhether the doctor’s story was not a fabrication, several acquaintances\r\nof his (among whom was the same postmaster who wrote Keys, as before\r\nmentioned) were introduced as sort of compurgators, who swore that they\r\nknew the doctor to be of good character for truth and veracity, and\r\ngenerally of good character in every way.\r\n\r\nHere the testimony ended, and the Trailors were discharged, Arch. and\r\nWilliam expressing both in word and manner their entire confidence that\r\nFisher would be found alive at the doctor’s by Galloway, Mallory, and\r\nMyers, who a day before had been despatched for that purpose; which\r\nHenry still protested that no power on earth could ever show Fisher\r\nalive. Thus stands this curious affair. When the doctor’s story\r\nwas first made public, it was amusing to scan and contemplate the\r\ncountenances and hear the remarks of those who had been actively in\r\nsearch for the dead body: some looked quizzical, some melancholy, and\r\nsome furiously angry. Porter, who had been very active, swore he always\r\nknew the man was not dead, and that he had not stirred an inch to hunt\r\nfor him; Langford, who had taken the lead in cutting down Hickox’s\r\nmill-dam, and wanted to hang Hickox for objecting, looked most\r\nawfully woebegone: he seemed the “victim of unrequited affection,” as\r\nrepresented in the comic almanacs we used to laugh over; and Hart, the\r\nlittle drayman that hauled Molly home once, said it was too damned bad\r\nto have so much trouble, and no hanging after all.\r\n\r\nI commenced this letter on yesterday, since which I received yours of\r\nthe 13th. I stick to my promise to come to Louisville. Nothing new here\r\nexcept what I have written. I have not seen ______ since my last trip,\r\nand I am going out there as soon as I mail this letter.\r\n\r\nYours forever, LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATEMENT ABOUT HARRY WILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 25, 1841\r\n\r\nIt having been charged in some of the public prints that Harry Wilton,\r\nlate United States marshal for the district of Illinois, had used his\r\noffice for political effect, in the appointment of deputies for the\r\ntaking of the census for the year 1840, we, the undersigned, were called\r\nupon by Mr. Wilton to examine the papers in his possession relative\r\nto these appointments, and to ascertain therefrom the correctness or\r\nincorrectness of such charge. We accompanied Mr. Wilton to a room, and\r\nexamined the matter as fully as we could with the means afforded us. The\r\nonly sources of information bearing on the subject which were submitted\r\nto us were the letters, etc., recommending and opposing the various\r\nappointments made, and Mr. Wilton’s verbal statements concerning the\r\nsame. From these letters, etc., it appears that in some instances\r\nappointments were made in accordance with the recommendations of leading\r\nWhigs, and in opposition to those of leading Democrats; among which\r\ninstances the appointments at Scott, Wayne, Madison, and Lawrence are\r\nthe strongest. According to Mr. Wilton’s statement of the seventy-six\r\nappointments we examined, fifty-four were of Democrats, eleven of Whigs,\r\nand eleven of unknown politics.\r\n\r\nThe chief ground of complaint against Mr. Wilton, as we had understood\r\nit, was because of his appointment of so many Democratic candidates for\r\nthe Legislature, thus giving them a decided advantage over their\r\nWhig opponents; and consequently our attention was directed rather\r\nparticularly to that point. We found that there were many such\r\nappointments, among which were those in Tazewell, McLean, Iroquois,\r\nColes, Menard, Wayne, Washington, Fayette, etc.; and we did not\r\nlearn that there was one instance in which a Whig candidate for the\r\nLegislature had been appointed. There was no written evidence before\r\nus showing us at what time those appointments were made; but Mr. Wilton\r\nstated that they all with one exception were made before those\r\nappointed became candidates for the Legislature, and the letters, etc.,\r\nrecommending them all bear date before, and most of them long before,\r\nthose appointed were publicly announced candidates.\r\n\r\nWe give the foregoing naked facts and draw no conclusions from them.\r\n\r\nBEND. S. EDWARDS, A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MISS MARY SPEED—PRACTICAL SLAVERY\r\n\r\n\r\nBLOOMINGTON, ILL., September 27, 1841.\r\n\r\nMiss Mary Speed, Louisville, Ky.\r\n\r\nMY FRIEND: By the way, a fine example was presented on board the boat\r\nfor contemplating the effect of condition upon human happiness. A\r\ngentleman had purchased twelve negroes in different parts of Kentucky,\r\nand was taking them to a farm in the South. They were chained six and\r\nsix together. A small iron clevis was around the left wrist of each,\r\nand this fastened to the main chain by a shorter one, at a convenient\r\ndistance from the others, so that the negroes were strung together\r\nprecisely like so many fish upon a trotline. In this condition they\r\nwere being separated forever from the scenes of their childhood, their\r\nfriends, their fathers and mothers, and brothers and sisters, and many\r\nof them from their wives and children, and going into perpetual\r\nslavery where the lash of the master is proverbially more ruthless\r\nand unrelenting than any other; and yet amid all these distressing\r\ncircumstances, as we would think them, they were the most cheerful and\r\napparently happy creatures on board. One, whose offence for which he\r\nhad been sold was an overfondness for his wife, played the fiddle almost\r\ncontinually, and the others danced, sang, cracked jokes, and played\r\nvarious games with cards from day to day. How true it is that ‘God\r\ntempers the wind to the shorn lamb,’ or in other words, that he renders\r\nthe worst of human conditions tolerable, while he permits the best to\r\nbe nothing better than tolerable. To return to the narrative: When we\r\nreached Springfield I stayed but one day, when I started on this tedious\r\ncircuit where I now am. Do you remember my going to the city, while I\r\nwas in Kentucky, to have a tooth extracted, and making a failure of it?\r\nWell, that same old tooth got to paining me so much that about a week\r\nsince I had it torn out, bringing with it a bit of the jawbone, the\r\nconsequence of which is that my mouth is now so sore that I can neither\r\ntalk nor eat.\r\n\r\nYour sincere friend, A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1842\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSHUA F. SPEED—ON MARRIAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary 30, 1842.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SPEED:—Feeling, as you know I do, the deepest solicitude for\r\nthe success of the enterprise you are engaged in, I adopt this as the\r\nlast method I can adopt to aid you, in case (which God forbid!) you\r\nshall need any aid. I do not place what I am going to say on paper\r\nbecause I can say it better that way than I could by word of mouth, but,\r\nwere I to say it orally before we part, most likely you would forget\r\nit at the very time when it might do you some good. As I think it\r\nreasonable that you will feel very badly some time between this and the\r\nfinal consummation of your purpose, it is intended that you shall read\r\nthis just at such a time. Why I say it is reasonable that you will feel\r\nvery badly yet, is because of three special causes added to the general\r\none which I shall mention.\r\n\r\nThe general cause is, that you are naturally of a nervous temperament;\r\nand this I say from what I have seen of you personally, and what you\r\nhave told me concerning your mother at various times, and concerning\r\nyour brother William at the time his wife died. The first special cause\r\nis your exposure to bad weather on your journey, which my experience\r\nclearly proves to be very severe on defective nerves. The second is the\r\nabsence of all business and conversation of friends, which might divert\r\nyour mind, give it occasional rest from the intensity of thought which\r\nwill sometimes wear the sweetest idea threadbare and turn it to the\r\nbitterness of death. The third is the rapid and near approach of that\r\ncrisis on which all your thoughts and feelings concentrate.\r\n\r\nIf from all these causes you shall escape and go through triumphantly,\r\nwithout another “twinge of the soul,” I shall be most happily but most\r\negregiously deceived. If, on the contrary, you shall, as I expect you\r\nwill at sometime, be agonized and distressed, let me, who have some\r\nreason to speak with judgment on such a subject, beseech you to ascribe\r\nit to the causes I have mentioned, and not to some false and ruinous\r\nsuggestion of the Devil.\r\n\r\n“But,” you will say, “do not your causes apply to every one engaged in\r\na like undertaking?” By no means. The particular causes, to a greater\r\nor less extent, perhaps do apply in all cases; but the general\r\none,—nervous debility, which is the key and conductor of all\r\nthe particular ones, and without which they would be utterly\r\nharmless,—though it does pertain to you, does not pertain to one in a\r\nthousand. It is out of this that the painful difference between you and\r\nthe mass of the world springs.\r\n\r\nI know what the painful point with you is at all times when you are\r\nunhappy; it is an apprehension that you do not love her as you should.\r\nWhat nonsense! How came you to court her? Was it because you thought she\r\ndeserved it, and that you had given her reason to expect it? If it was\r\nfor that why did not the same reason make you court Ann Todd, and at\r\nleast twenty others of whom you can think, and to whom it would apply\r\nwith greater force than to her? Did you court her for her wealth? Why,\r\nyou know she had none. But you say you reasoned yourself into it. What\r\ndo you mean by that? Was it not that you found yourself unable to reason\r\nyourself out of it? Did you not think, and partly form the purpose, of\r\ncourting her the first time you ever saw her or heard of her? What had\r\nreason to do with it at that early stage? There was nothing at that time\r\nfor reason to work upon. Whether she was moral, amiable, sensible,\r\nor even of good character, you did not, nor could then know, except,\r\nperhaps, you might infer the last from the company you found her in.\r\n\r\nAll you then did or could know of her was her personal appearance and\r\ndeportment; and these, if they impress at all, impress the heart, and\r\nnot the head.\r\n\r\nSay candidly, were not those heavenly black eyes the whole basis of all\r\nyour early reasoning on the subject? After you and I had once been at\r\nthe residence, did you not go and take me all the way to Lexington and\r\nback, for no other purpose but to get to see her again, on our return\r\non that evening to take a trip for that express object? What earthly\r\nconsideration would you take to find her scouting and despising you, and\r\ngiving herself up to another? But of this you have no apprehension; and\r\ntherefore you cannot bring it home to your feelings.\r\n\r\nI shall be so anxious about you that I shall want you to write by every\r\nmail.\r\n\r\nYour friend, LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSHUA F. SPEED.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, February 3, 1842.\r\n\r\nDEAR SPEED:—Your letter of the 25th January came to hand to-day. You\r\nwell know that I do not feel my own sorrows much more keenly than I do\r\nyours, when I know of them; and yet I assure you I was not much hurt by\r\nwhat you wrote me of your excessively bad feeling at the time you wrote.\r\nNot that I am less capable of sympathizing with you now than ever, not\r\nthat I am less your friend than ever, but because I hope and believe\r\nthat your present anxiety and distress about her health and her life\r\nmust and will forever banish those horrid doubts which I know you\r\nsometimes felt as to the truth of your affection for her. If they can\r\nonce and forever be removed (and I almost feel a presentiment that the\r\nAlmighty has sent your present affliction expressly for that object),\r\nsurely nothing can come in their stead to fill their immeasurable\r\nmeasure of misery. The death-scenes of those we love are surely painful\r\nenough; but these we are prepared for and expect to see: they happen to\r\nall, and all know they must happen. Painful as they are, they are not\r\nan unlooked for sorrow. Should she, as you fear, be destined to an early\r\ngrave, it is indeed a great consolation to know that she is so well\r\nprepared to meet it. Her religion, which you once disliked so much,\r\nI will venture you now prize most highly. But I hope your melancholy\r\nbodings as to her early death are not well founded. I even hope that\r\nere this reaches you she will have returned with improved and still\r\nimproving health, and that you will have met her, and forgotten the\r\nsorrows of the past in the enjoyments of the present. I would say more\r\nif I could, but it seems that I have said enough. It really appears\r\nto me that you yourself ought to rejoice, and not sorrow, at this\r\nindubitable evidence of your undying affection for her. Why, Speed, if\r\nyou did not love her although you might not wish her death, you would\r\nmost certainly be resigned to it. Perhaps this point is no longer\r\na question with you, and my pertinacious dwelling upon it is a rude\r\nintrusion upon your feelings. If so, you must pardon me. You know the\r\nhell I have suffered on that point, and how tender I am upon it. You\r\nknow I do not mean wrong. I have been quite clear of “hypo” since you\r\nleft, even better than I was along in the fall. I have seen ______ but\r\nonce. She seemed very cheerful, and so I said nothing to her about what\r\nwe spoke of.\r\n\r\nOld Uncle Billy Herndon is dead, and it is said this evening that Uncle\r\nBen Ferguson will not live. This, I believe, is all the news, and enough\r\nat that unless it were better. Write me immediately on the receipt of\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nYour friend, as ever, LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSHUA F. SPEED—ON DEPRESSION\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, February 13, 1842.\r\n\r\nDEAR SPEED:—Yours of the 1st instant came to hand three or four days\r\nago. When this shall reach you, you will have been Fanny’s husband\r\nseveral days. You know my desire to befriend you is everlasting; that\r\nI will never cease while I know how to do anything. But you will always\r\nhereafter be on ground that I have never occupied, and consequently,\r\nif advice were needed, I might advise wrong. I do fondly hope, however,\r\nthat you will never again need any comfort from abroad. But should I be\r\nmistaken in this, should excessive pleasure still be accompanied with\r\na painful counterpart at times, still let me urge you, as I have ever\r\ndone, to remember, in the depth and even agony of despondency, that very\r\nshortly you are to feel well again. I am now fully convinced that you\r\nlove her as ardently as you are capable of loving. Your ever being happy\r\nin her presence, and your intense anxiety about her health, if there\r\nwere nothing else, would place this beyond all dispute in my mind. I\r\nincline to think it probable that your nerves will fail you occasionally\r\nfor a while; but once you get them firmly guarded now that trouble is\r\nover forever. I think, if I were you, in case my mind were not exactly\r\nright, I would avoid being idle. I would immediately engage in some\r\nbusiness, or go to making preparations for it, which would be the same\r\nthing. If you went through the ceremony calmly, or even with sufficient\r\ncomposure not to excite alarm in any present, you are safe beyond\r\nquestion, and in two or three months, to say the most, will be the\r\nhappiest of men.\r\n\r\nI would desire you to give my particular respects to Fanny; but perhaps\r\nyou will not wish her to know you have received this, lest she should\r\ndesire to see it. Make her write me an answer to my last letter to her;\r\nat any rate I would set great value upon a note or letter from her.\r\nWrite me whenever you have leisure. Yours forever, A. LINCOLN. P. S.—I\r\nhave been quite a man since you left.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO G. B. SHELEDY.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., Feb. 16, 1842.\r\n\r\nG. B. SHELEDY, ESQ.:\r\n\r\nYours of the 10th is duly received. Judge Logan and myself are doing\r\nbusiness together now, and we are willing to attend to your cases as you\r\npropose. As to the terms, we are willing to attend each case you prepare\r\nand send us for $10 (when there shall be no opposition) to be sent in\r\nadvance, or you to know that it is safe. It takes $5.75 of cost to\r\nstart upon, that is, $1.75 to clerk, and $2 to each of two publishers\r\nof papers. Judge Logan thinks it will take the balance of $20 to carry\r\na case through. This must be advanced from time to time as the services\r\nare performed, as the officers will not act without. I do not know\r\nwhether you can be admitted an attorney of the Federal court in your\r\nabsence or not; nor is it material, as the business can be done in our\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nThinking it may aid you a little, I send you one of our blank forms of\r\nPetitions. It, you will see, is framed to be sworn to before the Federal\r\ncourt clerk, and, in your cases, will have [to] be so far changed as to\r\nbe sworn to before the clerk of your circuit court; and his certificate\r\nmust be accompanied with his official seal. The schedules, too, must\r\nbe attended to. Be sure that they contain the creditors’ names, their\r\nresidences, the amounts due each, the debtors’ names, their residences,\r\nand the amounts they owe, also all property and where located.\r\n\r\nAlso be sure that the schedules are all signed by the applicants as well\r\nas the Petition. Publication will have to be made here in one paper,\r\nand in one nearest the residence of the applicant. Write us in each case\r\nwhere the last advertisement is to be sent, whether to you or to what\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nI believe I have now said everything that can be of any advantage. Your\r\nfriend as ever, A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE E. PICKETT—ADVICE TO YOUTH\r\n\r\n\r\nFebruary 22, 1842.\r\n\r\nI never encourage deceit, and falsehood, especially if you have got a\r\nbad memory, is the worst enemy a fellow can have. The fact is truth\r\nis your truest friend, no matter what the circumstances are.\r\nNotwithstanding this copy-book preamble, my boy, I am inclined to\r\nsuggest a little prudence on your part. You see I have a congenital\r\naversion to failure, and the sudden announcement to your Uncle Andrew of\r\nthe success of your “lamp rubbing” might possibly prevent your passing\r\nthe severe physical examination to which you will be subjected in order\r\nto enter the Military Academy. You see I should like to have a perfect\r\nsoldier credited to dear old Illinois—no broken bones, scalp wounds,\r\netc. So I think it might be wise to hand this letter from me in to\r\nyour good uncle through his room-window after he has had a comfortable\r\ndinner, and watch its effect from the top of the pigeon-house.\r\n\r\nI have just told the folks here in Springfield on this 111th anniversary\r\nof the birth of him whose name, mightiest in the cause of civil liberty,\r\nstill mightiest in the cause of moral reformation, we mention in solemn\r\nawe, in naked, deathless splendor, that the one victory we can ever call\r\ncomplete will be that one which proclaims that there is not one slave or\r\none drunkard on the face of God’s green earth. Recruit for this victory.\r\n\r\nNow, boy, on your march, don’t you go and forget the old maxim that “one\r\ndrop of honey catches more flies than a half-gallon of gall.” Load your\r\nmusket with this maxim, and smoke it in your pipe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS BEFORE THE SPRINGFIELD WASHINGTONIAN TEMPERANCE SOCIETY,\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 22, 1842.\r\n\r\nAlthough the temperance cause has been in progress for near twenty\r\nyears, it is apparent to all that it is just now being crowned with a\r\ndegree of success hitherto unparalleled.\r\n\r\nThe list of its friends is daily swelled by the additions of fifties, of\r\nhundreds, and of thousands. The cause itself seems suddenly transformed\r\nfrom a cold abstract theory to a living, breathing, active, and powerful\r\nchieftain, going forth “conquering and to conquer.” The citadels of his\r\ngreat adversary are daily being stormed and dismantled; his temple and\r\nhis altars, where the rites of his idolatrous worship have long been\r\nperformed, and where human sacrifices have long been wont to be made,\r\nare daily desecrated and deserted. The triumph of the conqueror’s fame\r\nis sounding from hill to hill, from sea to sea, and from land to land,\r\nand calling millions to his standard at a blast.\r\n\r\nFor this new and splendid success we heartily rejoice. That that success\r\nis so much greater now than heretofore is doubtless owing to rational\r\ncauses; and if we would have it continue, we shall do well to inquire\r\nwhat those causes are.\r\n\r\nThe warfare heretofore waged against the demon intemperance has somehow\r\nor other been erroneous. Either the champions engaged or the tactics\r\nthey adopted have not been the most proper. These champions for the most\r\npart have been preachers, lawyers, and hired agents. Between these and\r\nthe mass of mankind there is a want of approachability, if the term\r\nbe admissible, partially, at least, fatal to their success. They are\r\nsupposed to have no sympathy of feeling or interest with those very\r\npersons whom it is their object to convince and persuade.\r\n\r\nAnd again, it is so common and so easy to ascribe motives to men of\r\nthese classes other than those they profess to act upon. The preacher,\r\nit is said, advocates temperance because he is a fanatic, and desires a\r\nunion of the Church and State; the lawyer from his pride and vanity of\r\nhearing himself speak; and the hired agent for his salary. But when one\r\nwho has long been known as a victim of intemperance bursts the fetters\r\nthat have bound him, and appears before his neighbors “clothed and in\r\nhis right mind,” a redeemed specimen of long-lost humanity, and stands\r\nup, with tears of joy trembling in his eyes, to tell of the miseries\r\nonce endured, now to be endured no more forever; of his once naked and\r\nstarving children, now clad and fed comfortably; of a wife long weighed\r\ndown with woe, weeping, and a broken heart, now restored to health,\r\nhappiness, and a renewed affection; and how easily it is all done, once\r\nit is resolved to be done; how simple his language! there is a logic and\r\nan eloquence in it that few with human feelings can resist. They cannot\r\nsay that he desires a union of Church and State, for he is not a church\r\nmember; they cannot say he is vain of hearing himself speak, for his\r\nwhole demeanor shows he would gladly avoid speaking at all; they cannot\r\nsay he speaks for pay, for he receives none, and asks for none. Nor can\r\nhis sincerity in any way be doubted, or his sympathy for those he would\r\npersuade to imitate his example be denied.\r\n\r\nIn my judgment, it is to the battles of this new class of champions\r\nthat our late success is greatly, perhaps chiefly, owing. But, had the\r\nold-school champions themselves been of the most wise selecting, was\r\ntheir system of tactics the most judicious? It seems to me it was\r\nnot. Too much denunciation against dram-sellers and dram-drinkers\r\nwas indulged in. This I think was both impolitic and unjust. It was\r\nimpolitic, because it is not much in the nature of man to be driven to\r\nanything; still less to be driven about that which is exclusively his\r\nown business; and least of all where such driving is to be submitted\r\nto at the expense of pecuniary interest or burning appetite. When the\r\ndram-seller and drinker were incessantly told not in accents of entreaty\r\nand persuasion, diffidently addressed by erring man to an erring\r\nbrother, but in the thundering tones of anathema and denunciation with\r\nwhich the lordly judge often groups together all the crimes of the\r\nfelon’s life, and thrusts them in his face just ere he passes sentence\r\nof death upon him that they were the authors of all the vice and misery\r\nand crime in the land; that they were the manufacturers and material of\r\nall the thieves and robbers and murderers that infest the earth; that\r\ntheir houses were the workshops of the devil; and that their persons\r\nshould be shunned by all the good and virtuous, as moral pestilences—I\r\nsay, when they were told all this, and in this way, it is not wonderful\r\nthat they were slow to acknowledge the truth of such denunciations,\r\nand to join the ranks of their denouncers in a hue and cry against\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nTo have expected them to do otherwise than they did to have expected\r\nthem not to meet denunciation with denunciation, crimination with\r\ncrimination, and anathema with anathema—was to expect a reversal of\r\nhuman nature, which is God’s decree and can never be reversed.\r\n\r\nWhen the conduct of men is designed to be influenced, persuasion, kind,\r\nunassuming persuasion, should ever be adopted. It is an old and a true\r\nmaxim that “a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.”\r\nSo with men. If you would win a man to your cause, first convince him\r\nthat you are his sincere friend. Therein is a drop of honey that catches\r\nhis heart, which, say what he will, is the great highroad to his\r\nreason; and which, when once gained, you will find but little trouble\r\nin convincing his judgment of the justice of your cause, if indeed that\r\ncause really be a just one. On the contrary, assume to dictate to his\r\njudgment, or to command his action, or to mark him as one to be shunned\r\nand despised, and he will retreat within himself, close all the avenues\r\nto his head and his heart; and though your cause be naked truth itself,\r\ntransformed to the heaviest lance, harder than steel, and sharper than\r\nsteel can be made, and though you throw it with more than herculean\r\nforce and precision, you shall be no more able to pierce him than to\r\npenetrate the hard shell of a tortoise with a rye straw. Such is man,\r\nand so must he be understood by those who would lead him, even to his\r\nown best interests.\r\n\r\nOn this point the Washingtonians greatly excel the temperance advocates\r\nof former times. Those whom they desire to convince and persuade are\r\ntheir old friends and companions. They know they are not demons, nor\r\neven the worst of men; they know that generally they are kind, generous,\r\nand charitable even beyond the example of their more staid and sober\r\nneighbors. They are practical philanthropists; and they glow with\r\na generous and brotherly zeal that mere theorizers are incapable of\r\nfeeling. Benevolence and charity possess their hearts entirely; and out\r\nof the abundance of their hearts their tongues give utterance; “love\r\nthrough all their actions runs, and all their words are mild.” In this\r\nspirit they speak and act, and in the same they are heard and regarded.\r\nAnd when such is the temper of the advocate, and such of the audience,\r\nno good cause can be unsuccessful. But I have said that denunciations\r\nagainst dramsellers and dram-drinkers are unjust, as well as impolitic.\r\nLet us see. I have not inquired at what period of time the use of\r\nintoxicating liquors commenced; nor is it important to know. It is\r\nsufficient that, to all of us who now inhabit the world, the practice of\r\ndrinking them is just as old as the world itself that is, we have seen\r\nthe one just as long as we have seen the other. When all such of us as\r\nhave now reached the years of maturity first opened our eyes upon\r\nthe stage of existence, we found intoxicating liquor recognized by\r\neverybody, used by everybody, repudiated by nobody. It commonly entered\r\ninto the first draught of the infant and the last draught of the dying\r\nman. From the sideboard of the parson down to the ragged pocket of the\r\nhouseless loafer, it was constantly found. Physicians proscribed it in\r\nthis, that, and the other disease; government provided it for soldiers\r\nand sailors; and to have a rolling or raising, a husking or “hoedown,”\r\nanywhere about without it was positively insufferable. So, too, it was\r\neverywhere a respectable article of manufacture and merchandise. The\r\nmaking of it was regarded as an honorable livelihood, and he who could\r\nmake most was the most enterprising and respectable. Large and small\r\nmanufactories of it were everywhere erected, in which all the earthly\r\ngoods of their owners were invested. Wagons drew it from town to town;\r\nboats bore it from clime to clime, and the winds wafted it from nation\r\nto nation; and merchants bought and sold it, by wholesale and retail,\r\nwith precisely the same feelings on the part of the seller, buyer, and\r\nbystander as are felt at the selling and buying of ploughs, beef, bacon,\r\nor any other of the real necessaries of life. Universal public opinion\r\nnot only tolerated but recognized and adopted its use.\r\n\r\nIt is true that even then it was known and acknowledged that many were\r\ngreatly injured by it; but none seemed to think the injury arose from\r\nthe use of a bad thing, but from the abuse of a very good thing. The\r\nvictims of it were to be pitied and compassionated, just as are the\r\nheirs of consumption and other hereditary diseases. Their failing was\r\ntreated as a misfortune, and not as a crime, or even as a disgrace. If,\r\nthen, what I have been saying is true, is it wonderful that some should\r\nthink and act now as all thought and acted twenty years ago? and is it\r\njust to assail, condemn, or despise them for doing so? The universal\r\nsense of mankind on any subject is an argument, or at least an\r\ninfluence, not easily overcome. The success of the argument in favor\r\nof the existence of an overruling Providence mainly depends upon that\r\nsense; and men ought not in justice to be denounced for yielding to it\r\nin any case, or giving it up slowly, especially when they are backed by\r\ninterest, fixed habits, or burning appetites.\r\n\r\nAnother error, as it seems to me, into which the old reformers fell, was\r\nthe position that all habitual drunkards were utterly incorrigible, and\r\ntherefore must be turned adrift and damned without remedy in order that\r\nthe grace of temperance might abound, to the temperate then, and to all\r\nmankind some hundreds of years thereafter. There is in this some\r\nthing so repugnant to humanity, so uncharitable, so cold-blooded and\r\nfeelingless, that it, never did nor ever can enlist the enthusiasm of a\r\npopular cause. We could not love the man who taught it we could not hear\r\nhim with patience. The heart could not throw open its portals to it,\r\nthe generous man could not adopt it—it could not mix with his blood.\r\nIt looked so fiendishly selfish, so like throwing fathers and brothers\r\noverboard to lighten the boat for our security, that the noble-minded\r\nshrank from the manifest meanness of the thing. And besides this, the\r\nbenefits of a reformation to be effected by such a system were too\r\nremote in point of time to warmly engage many in its behalf. Few can\r\nbe induced to labor exclusively for posterity, and none will do it\r\nenthusiastically. —Posterity has done nothing for us; and, theorize on\r\nit as we may, practically we shall do very little for it, unless we are\r\nmade to think we are at the same time doing something for ourselves.\r\n\r\nWhat an ignorance of human nature does it exhibit to ask or to expect\r\na whole community to rise up and labor for the temporal happiness of\r\nothers, after themselves shall be consigned to the dust, a majority\r\nof which community take no pains whatever to secure their own eternal\r\nwelfare at no more distant day! Great distance in either time or\r\nspace has wonderful power to lull and render quiescent the human mind.\r\nPleasures to be enjoyed, or pains to be endured, after we shall be dead\r\nand gone are but little regarded even in our own cases, and much less\r\nin the cases of others. Still, in addition to this there is something so\r\nludicrous in promises of good or threats of evil a great way off as to\r\nrender the whole subject with which they are connected easily turned\r\ninto ridicule. “Better lay down that spade you are stealing, Paddy; if\r\nyou don’t you’ll pay for it at the day of judgment.” “Be the powers, if\r\nye’ll credit me so long I’ll take another jist.”\r\n\r\nBy the Washingtonians this system of consigning the habitual drunkard\r\nto hopeless ruin is repudiated. They adopt a more enlarged philanthropy;\r\nthey go for present as well as future good. They labor for all now\r\nliving, as well as hereafter to live. They teach hope to all-despair to\r\nnone. As applying to their cause, they deny the doctrine of\r\nunpardonable sin; as in Christianity it is taught, so in this they\r\nteach—“While—While the lamp holds out to burn, The vilest sinner may\r\nreturn.” And, what is a matter of more profound congratulation, they, by\r\nexperiment upon experiment and example upon example, prove the maxim\r\nto be no less true in the one case than in the other. On every hand we\r\nbehold those who but yesterday were the chief of sinners, now the chief\r\napostles of the cause. Drunken devils are cast out by ones, by sevens,\r\nby legions; and their unfortunate victims, like the poor possessed who\r\nwere redeemed from their long and lonely wanderings in the tombs, are\r\npublishing to the ends of the earth how great things have been done for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nTo these new champions and this new system of tactics our late\r\nsuccess is mainly owing, and to them we must mainly look for the final\r\nconsummation. The ball is now rolling gloriously on, and none are so\r\nable as they to increase its speed and its bulk, to add to its momentum\r\nand its magnitude—even though unlearned in letters, for this task none\r\nare so well educated. To fit them for this work they have been taught in\r\nthe true school. They have been in that gulf from which they would teach\r\nothers the means of escape. They have passed that prison wall which\r\nothers have long declared impassable; and who that has not shall dare to\r\nweigh opinions with them as to the mode of passing?\r\n\r\nBut if it be true, as I have insisted, that those who have suffered by\r\nintemperance personally, and have reformed, are the most powerful and\r\nefficient instruments to push the reformation to ultimate success, it\r\ndoes not follow that those who have not suffered have no part left them\r\nto perform. Whether or not the world would be vastly benefited by a\r\ntotal and final banishment from it of all intoxicating drinks seems\r\nto me not now an open question. Three fourths of mankind confess the\r\naffirmative with their tongues, and, I believe, all the rest acknowledge\r\nit in their hearts.\r\n\r\nOught any, then, to refuse their aid in doing what good the good of the\r\nwhole demands? Shall he who cannot do much be for that reason excused\r\nif he do nothing? “But,” says one, “what good can I do by signing the\r\npledge? I never drank, even without signing.” This question has already\r\nbeen asked and answered more than a million of times. Let it be answered\r\nonce more. For the man suddenly or in any other way to break off from\r\nthe use of drams, who has indulged in them for a long course of years\r\nand until his appetite for them has grown ten or a hundredfold stronger\r\nand more craving than any natural appetite can be, requires a most\r\npowerful moral effort. In such an undertaking he needs every moral\r\nsupport and influence that can possibly be brought to his aid and thrown\r\naround him. And not only so, but every moral prop should be taken from\r\nwhatever argument might rise in his mind to lure him to his backsliding.\r\nWhen he casts his eyes around him, he should be able to see all that he\r\nrespects, all that he admires, all that he loves, kindly and anxiously\r\npointing him onward, and none beckoning him back to his former miserable\r\n“wallowing in the mire.”\r\n\r\nBut it is said by some that men will think and act for themselves; that\r\nnone will disuse spirits or anything else because his neighbors do; and\r\nthat moral influence is not that powerful engine contended for. Let us\r\nexamine this. Let me ask the man who could maintain this position most\r\nstiffly, what compensation he will accept to go to church some Sunday\r\nand sit during the sermon with his wife’s bonnet upon his head? Not a\r\ntrifle, I’ll venture. And why not? There would be nothing irreligious\r\nin it, nothing immoral, nothing uncomfortable—then why not? Is it not\r\nbecause there would be something egregiously unfashionable in it? Then\r\nit is the influence of fashion; and what is the influence of fashion\r\nbut the influence that other people’s actions have on our actions—the\r\nstrong inclination each of us feels to do as we see all our neighbors\r\ndo? Nor is the influence of fashion confined to any particular thing or\r\nclass of things; it is just as strong on one subject as another. Let us\r\nmake it as unfashionable to withhold our names from the temperance cause\r\nas for husbands to wear their wives’ bonnets to church, and instances\r\nwill be just as rare in the one case as the other.\r\n\r\n“But,” say some, “we are no drunkards, and we shall not acknowledge\r\nourselves such by joining a reformed drunkard’s society, whatever our\r\ninfluence might be.” Surely no Christian will adhere to this objection.\r\nIf they believe as they profess, that Omnipotence condescended to take\r\non himself the form of sinful man, and as such to die an ignominious\r\ndeath for their sakes, surely they will not refuse submission to the\r\ninfinitely lesser condescension, for the temporal, and perhaps\r\neternal, salvation of a large, erring, and unfortunate class of their\r\nfellow-creatures. Nor is the condescension very great. In my judgment\r\nsuch of us as have never fallen victims have been spared more by the\r\nabsence of appetite than from any mental or moral superiority over those\r\nwho have. Indeed, I believe if we take habitual drunkards as a class,\r\ntheir heads and their hearts will bear an advantageous comparison with\r\nthose of any other class. There seems ever to have been a proneness\r\nin the brilliant and warm-blooded to fall into this vice—the demon of\r\nintemperance ever seems to have delighted in sucking the blood of genius\r\nand of generosity. What one of us but can call to mind some relative,\r\nmore promising in youth than all his fellows, who has fallen a sacrifice\r\nto his rapacity? He ever seems to have gone forth like the Egyptian\r\nangel of death, commissioned to slay, if not the first, the fairest born\r\nof every family. Shall he now be arrested in his desolating career? In\r\nthat arrest all can give aid that will; and who shall be excused that\r\ncan and will not? Far around as human breath has ever blown he keeps our\r\nfathers, our brothers, our sons, and our friends prostrate in the chains\r\nof moral death. To all the living everywhere we cry, “Come sound the\r\nmoral trump, that these may rise and stand up an exceeding great army.”\r\n“Come from the four winds, O breath! and breathe upon these slain\r\nthat they may live.” If the relative grandeur of revolutions shall be\r\nestimated by the great amount of human misery they alleviate, and the\r\nsmall amount they inflict, then indeed will this be the grandest the\r\nworld shall ever have seen.\r\n\r\nOf our political revolution of ‘76 we are all justly proud. It has given\r\nus a degree of political freedom far exceeding that of any other nation\r\nof the earth. In it the world has found a solution of the long-mooted\r\nproblem as to the capability of man to govern himself. In it was the\r\ngerm which has vegetated, and still is to grow and expand into the\r\nuniversal liberty of mankind. But, with all these glorious results,\r\npast, present, and to come, it had its evils too. It breathed forth\r\nfamine, swam in blood, and rode in fire; and long, long after, the\r\norphan’s cry and the widow’s wail continued to break the sad silence\r\nthat ensued. These were the price, the inevitable price, paid for the\r\nblessings it bought.\r\n\r\nTurn now to the temperance revolution. In it we shall find a stronger\r\nbondage broken, a viler slavery manumitted, a greater tyrant deposed; in\r\nit, more of want supplied, more disease healed, more sorrow assuaged.\r\nBy it no Orphans starving, no widows weeping. By it none wounded in\r\nfeeling, none injured in interest; even the drammaker and dram-seller\r\nwill have glided into other occupations so gradually as never to\r\nhave felt the change, and will stand ready to join all others in the\r\nuniversal song of gladness. And what a noble ally this to the cause of\r\npolitical freedom, with such an aid its march cannot fail to be on\r\nand on, till every son of earth shall drink in rich fruition the\r\nsorrow-quenching draughts of perfect liberty. Happy day when-all\r\nappetites controlled, all poisons subdued, all matter subjected-mind,\r\nall-conquering mind, shall live and move, the monarch of the world.\r\nGlorious consummation! Hail, fall of fury! Reign of reason, all hail!\r\n\r\nAnd when the victory shall be complete, when there shall be neither\r\na slave nor a drunkard on the earth, how proud the title of that land\r\nwhich may truly claim to be the birthplace and the cradle of both\r\nthose revolutions that shall have ended in that victory. How nobly\r\ndistinguished that people who shall have planted and nurtured to\r\nmaturity both the political and moral freedom of their species.\r\n\r\nThis is the one hundred and tenth anniversary of the birthday of\r\nWashington; we are met to celebrate this day. Washington is the\r\nmightiest name of earth long since mightiest in the cause of civil\r\nliberty, still mightiest in moral reformation. On that name no eulogy\r\nis expected. It cannot be. To add brightness to the sun or glory to the\r\nname of Washington is alike impossible. Let none attempt it. In solemn\r\nawe pronounce the name, and in its naked deathless splendor leave it\r\nshining on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSHUA F. SPEED.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, February 25, 1842.\r\n\r\nDEAR SPEED:—Yours of the 16th instant, announcing that Miss Fanny and\r\nyou are “no more twain, but one flesh,” reached me this morning. I\r\nhave no way of telling you how much happiness I wish you both, though I\r\nbelieve you both can conceive it. I feel somewhat jealous of both of you\r\nnow: you will be so exclusively concerned for one another, that I shall\r\nbe forgotten entirely. My acquaintance with Miss Fanny (I call her this,\r\nlest you should think I am speaking of your mother) was too short for me\r\nto reasonably hope to long be remembered by her; and still I am sure I\r\nshall not forget her soon. Try if you cannot remind her of that debt she\r\nowes me—and be sure you do not interfere to prevent her paying it.\r\n\r\nI regret to learn that you have resolved to not return to Illinois.\r\nI shall be very lonesome without you. How miserably things seem to be\r\narranged in this world! If we have no friends, we have no pleasure; and\r\nif we have them, we are sure to lose them, and be doubly pained by the\r\nloss. I did hope she and you would make your home here; but I own I have\r\nno right to insist. You owe obligations to her ten thousand times\r\nmore sacred than you can owe to others, and in that light let them be\r\nrespected and observed. It is natural that she should desire to remain\r\nwith her relatives and friends. As to friends, however, she could not\r\nneed them anywhere: she would have them in abundance here.\r\n\r\nGive my kind remembrance to Mr. Williamson and his family, particularly\r\nMiss Elizabeth; also to your mother, brother, and sisters. Ask little\r\nEliza Davis if she will ride to town with me if I come there again. And\r\nfinally, give Fanny a double reciprocation of all the love she sent me.\r\nWrite me often, and believe me\r\n\r\nYours forever, LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nP. S. Poor Easthouse is gone at last. He died awhile before day this\r\nmorning. They say he was very loath to die....\r\n\r\nL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSHUA F. SPEED—ON MARRIAGE CONCERNS\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, February 25,1842.\r\n\r\nDEAR SPEED:—I received yours of the 12th written the day you went down\r\nto William’s place, some days since, but delayed answering it till I\r\nshould receive the promised one of the 16th, which came last night.\r\nI opened the letter with intense anxiety and trepidation; so much so,\r\nthat, although it turned out better than I expected, I have hardly yet,\r\nat a distance of ten hours, become calm.\r\n\r\nI tell you, Speed, our forebodings (for which you and I are peculiar)\r\nare all the worst sort of nonsense. I fancied, from the time I received\r\nyour letter of Saturday, that the one of Wednesday was never to come,\r\nand yet it did come, and what is more, it is perfectly clear, both from\r\nits tone and handwriting, that you were much happier, or, if you think\r\nthe term preferable, less miserable, when you wrote it than when you\r\nwrote the last one before. You had so obviously improved at the\r\nvery time I so much fancied you would have grown worse. You say that\r\nsomething indescribably horrible and alarming still haunts you. You will\r\nnot say that three months from now, I will venture. When your nerves\r\nonce get steady now, the whole trouble will be over forever. Nor should\r\nyou become impatient at their being even very slow in becoming steady.\r\nAgain you say, you much fear that that Elysium of which you have dreamed\r\nso much is never to be realized. Well, if it shall not, I dare swear it\r\nwill not be the fault of her who is now your wife. I now have no doubt\r\nthat it is the peculiar misfortune of both you and me to dream dreams of\r\nElysium far exceeding all that anything earthly can realize. Far short\r\nof your dreams as you may be, no woman could do more to realize them\r\nthan that same black-eyed Fanny. If you could but contemplate her\r\nthrough my imagination, it would appear ridiculous to you that any one\r\nshould for a moment think of being unhappy with her. My old father\r\nused to have a saying that “If you make a bad bargain, hug it all the\r\ntighter”; and it occurs to me that if the bargain you have just closed\r\ncan possibly be called a bad one, it is certainly the most pleasant one\r\nfor applying that maxim to which my fancy can by any effort picture.\r\n\r\nI write another letter, enclosing this, which you can show her, if she\r\ndesires it. I do this because she would think strangely, perhaps, should\r\nyou tell her that you received no letters from me, or, telling her you\r\ndo, refuse to let her see them. I close this, entertaining the confident\r\nhope that every successive letter I shall have from you (which I here\r\npray may not be few, nor far between) may show you possessing a more\r\nsteady hand and cheerful heart than the last preceding it. As ever, your\r\nfriend, LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSHUA F. SPEED.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, March 27, 1842\r\n\r\nDEAR SPEED:—Yours of the 10th instant was received three or four days\r\nsince. You know I am sincere when I tell you the pleasure its contents\r\ngave me was, and is, inexpressible. As to your farm matter, I have\r\nno sympathy with you. I have no farm, nor ever expect to have, and\r\nconsequently have not studied the subject enough to be much interested\r\nwith it. I can only say that I am glad you are satisfied and pleased\r\nwith it. But on that other subject, to me of the most intense interest\r\nwhether in joy or sorrow, I never had the power to withhold my sympathy\r\nfrom you. It cannot be told how it now thrills me with joy to hear you\r\nsay you are “far happier than you ever expected to be.” That much I know\r\nis enough. I know you too well to suppose your expectations were not,\r\nat least, sometimes extravagant, and if the reality exceeds them all, I\r\nsay, Enough, dear Lord. I am not going beyond the truth when I tell you\r\nthat the short space it took me to read your last letter gave me more\r\npleasure than the total sum of all I have enjoyed since the fatal 1st\r\nof January, 1841. Since then it seems to me I should have been entirely\r\nhappy, but for the never-absent idea that there is one still unhappy\r\nwhom I have contributed to make so. That still kills my soul. I cannot\r\nbut reproach myself for even wishing to be happy while she is otherwise.\r\nShe accompanied a large party on the railroad cars to Jacksonville\r\nlast Monday, and on her return spoke, so that I heard of it, of having\r\nenjoyed the trip exceedingly. God be praised for that.\r\n\r\nYou know with what sleepless vigilance I have watched you ever since the\r\ncommencement of your affair; and although I am almost confident it is\r\nuseless, I cannot forbear once more to say that I think it is even yet\r\npossible for your spirits to flag down and leave you miserable. If they\r\nshould, don’t fail to remember that they cannot long remain so. One\r\nthing I can tell you which I know you will be glad to hear, and that is\r\nthat I have seen—and scrutinized her feelings as well as I could, and\r\nam fully convinced she is far happier now than she has been for the last\r\nfifteen months past.\r\n\r\nYou will see by the last Sangamon Journal, that I made a temperance\r\nspeech on the 22d of February, which I claim that Fanny and you shall\r\nread as an act of charity to me; for I cannot learn that anybody else\r\nhas read it, or is likely to. Fortunately it is not very long, and I\r\nshall deem it a sufficient compliance with my request if one of you\r\nlistens while the other reads it.\r\n\r\nAs to your Lockridge matter, it is only necessary to say that there\r\nhas been no court since you left, and that the next commences to-morrow\r\nmorning, during which I suppose we cannot fail to get a judgment.\r\n\r\nI wish you would learn of Everett what he would take, over and above a\r\ndischarge for all the trouble we have been at, to take his business out\r\nof our hands and give it to somebody else. It is impossible to collect\r\nmoney on that or any other claim here now; and although you know I am\r\nnot a very petulant man, I declare I am almost out of patience with Mr.\r\nEverett’s importunity. It seems like he not only writes all the letters\r\nhe can himself, but gets everybody else in Louisville and vicinity to\r\nbe constantly writing to us about his claim. I have always said that\r\nMr. Everett is a very clever fellow, and I am very sorry he cannot be\r\nobliged; but it does seem to me he ought to know we are interested to\r\ncollect his claim, and therefore would do it if we could.\r\n\r\nI am neither joking nor in a pet when I say we would thank him to\r\ntransfer his business to some other, without any compensation for what\r\nwe have done, provided he will see the court cost paid, for which we are\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\nThe sweet violet you inclosed came safely to hand, but it was so dry,\r\nand mashed so flat, that it crumbled to dust at the first attempt\r\nto handle it. The juice that mashed out of it stained a place in the\r\nletter, which I mean to preserve and cherish for the sake of her who\r\nprocured it to be sent. My renewed good wishes to her in particular, and\r\ngenerally to all such of your relations who know me.\r\n\r\nAs ever,\r\n\r\nLINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSHUA F. SPEED.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, July 4, 1842.\r\n\r\nDEAR SPEED:—Yours of the 16th June was received only a day or two\r\nsince. It was not mailed at Louisville till the 25th. You speak of the\r\ngreat time that has elapsed since I wrote you. Let me explain that. Your\r\nletter reached here a day or two after I started on the circuit. I\r\nwas gone five or six weeks, so that I got the letters only a few weeks\r\nbefore Butler started to your country. I thought it scarcely worth while\r\nto write you the news which he could and would tell you more in detail.\r\nOn his return he told me you would write me soon, and so I waited for\r\nyour letter. As to my having been displeased with your advice, surely\r\nyou know better than that. I know you do, and therefore will not labor\r\nto convince you. True, that subject is painful to me; but it is not your\r\nsilence, or the silence of all the world, that can make me forget it. I\r\nacknowledge the correctness of your advice too; but before I resolve\r\nto do the one thing or the other, I must gain my confidence in my own\r\nability to keep my resolves when they are made. In that ability you know\r\nI once prided myself as the only or chief gem of my character; that gem\r\nI lost—how and where you know too well. I have not yet regained it; and\r\nuntil I do, I cannot trust myself in any matter of much importance. I\r\nbelieve now that had you understood my case at the time as well as I\r\nunderstand yours afterward, by the aid you would have given me I should\r\nhave sailed through clear, but that does not now afford me sufficient\r\nconfidence to begin that or the like of that again.\r\n\r\nYou make a kind acknowledgment of your obligations to me for your\r\npresent happiness. I am pleased with that acknowledgment. But a thousand\r\ntimes more am I pleased to know that you enjoy a degree of happiness\r\nworthy of an acknowledgment. The truth is, I am not sure that there was\r\nany merit with me in the part I took in your difficulty; I was drawn to\r\nit by a fate. If I would I could not have done less than I did. I always\r\nwas superstitious; I believe God made me one of the instruments of\r\nbringing your Fanny and you together, which union I have no doubt He had\r\nfore-ordained. Whatever He designs He will do for me yet. “Stand still,\r\nand see the salvation of the Lord” is my text just now. If, as you say,\r\nyou have told Fanny all, I should have no objection to her seeing this\r\nletter, but for its reference to our friend here: let her seeing it\r\ndepend upon whether she has ever known anything of my affairs; and if\r\nshe has not, do not let her.\r\n\r\nI do not think I can come to Kentucky this season. I am so poor and make\r\nso little headway in the world, that I drop back in a month of idleness\r\nas much as I gain in a year’s sowing. I should like to visit you again.\r\nI should like to see that “sis” of yours that was absent when I was\r\nthere, though I suppose she would run away again if she were to hear I\r\nwas coming.\r\n\r\nMy respects and esteem to all your friends there, and, by your\r\npermission, my love to your Fanny.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nLINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LETTER FROM THE LOST TOWNSHIPS\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle written by Lincoln for the Sangamon Journal in ridicule of James\r\nShields, who, as State Auditor, had declined to receive State Bank notes\r\nin payment of taxes. The above letter purported to come from a poor\r\nwidow who, though supplied with State Bank paper, could not obtain a\r\nreceipt for her tax bill. This, and another subsequent letter by Mary\r\nTodd, brought about the “Lincoln-Shields Duel.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOST TOWNSHIPS\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust 27, 1842.\r\n\r\nDEAR Mr. PRINTER:\r\n\r\nI see you printed that long letter I sent you a spell ago. I ’m quite\r\nencouraged by it, and can’t keep from writing again. I think the\r\nprinting of my letters will be a good thing all round—it will give\r\nme the benefit of being known by the world, and give the world the\r\nadvantage of knowing what’s going on in the Lost Townships, and give\r\nyour paper respectability besides. So here comes another. Yesterday\r\nafternoon I hurried through cleaning up the dinner dishes and stepped\r\nover to neighbor S——— to see if his wife Peggy was as well as mout be\r\nexpected, and hear what they called the baby. Well, when I got there and\r\njust turned round the corner of his log cabin, there he was, setting on\r\nthe doorstep reading a newspaper. “How are you, Jeff?” says I. He sorter\r\nstarted when he heard me, for he hadn’t seen me before. “Why,” says he,\r\n“I ’m mad as the devil, Aunt ’Becca!” “What about?” says I; “ain’t\r\nits hair the right color? None of that nonsense, Jeff; there ain’t an\r\nhonester woman in the Lost Townships than....”—“Than who?” says he;\r\n“what the mischief are you about?” I began to see I was running the\r\nwrong trail, and so says I, “Oh! nothing: I guess I was mistaken a\r\nlittle, that’s all. But what is it you ’re mad about?”\r\n\r\n“Why,” says he, “I’ve been tugging ever since harvest, getting out wheat\r\nand hauling it to the river to raise State Bank paper enough to pay my\r\ntax this year and a little school debt I owe; and now, just as I ’ve got\r\nit, here I open this infernal Extra Register, expecting to find it full\r\nof ‘Glorious Democratic Victories’ and ‘High Comb’d Cocks,’ when, lo\r\nand behold! I find a set of fellows, calling themselves officers of the\r\nState, have forbidden the tax collectors, and school commissioners to\r\nreceive State paper at all; and so here it is dead on my hands. I don’t\r\nnow believe all the plunder I’ve got will fetch ready cash enough to pay\r\nmy taxes and that school debt.”\r\n\r\nI was a good deal thunderstruck myself; for that was the first I had\r\nheard of the proclamation, and my old man was pretty much in the same\r\nfix with Jeff. We both stood a moment staring at one another without\r\nknowing what to say. At last says I, “Mr. S——— let me look at that\r\npaper.” He handed it to me, when I read the proclamation over.\r\n\r\n“There now,” says he, “did you ever see such a piece of impudence and\r\nimposition as that?” I saw Jeff was in a good tune for saying some\r\nill-natured things, and so I tho’t I would just argue a little on the\r\ncontrary side, and make him rant a spell if I could. “Why,” says I,\r\nlooking as dignified and thoughtful as I could, “it seems pretty tough,\r\nto be sure, to have to raise silver where there’s none to be raised; but\r\nthen, you see, ‘there will be danger of loss’ if it ain’t done.”\r\n\r\n“Loss! damnation!” says he. “I defy Daniel Webster, I defy King Solomon,\r\nI defy the world—I defy—I defy—yes, I defy even you, Aunt ’Becca,\r\nto show how the people can lose anything by paying their taxes in State\r\npaper.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” says I, “you see what the officers of State say about it, and\r\nthey are a desarnin’ set of men. But,” says I, “I guess you ’re mistaken\r\nabout what the proclamation says. It don’t say the people will lose\r\nanything by the paper money being taken for taxes. It only says ‘there\r\nwill be danger of loss’; and though it is tolerable plain that the\r\npeople can’t lose by paying their taxes in something they can get easier\r\nthan silver, instead of having to pay silver; and though it’s just as\r\nplain that the State can’t lose by taking State Bank paper, however low\r\nit may be, while she owes the bank more than the whole revenue, and\r\ncan pay that paper over on her debt, dollar for dollar;—still there is\r\ndanger of loss to the ‘officers of State’; and you know, Jeff, we can’t\r\nget along without officers of State.”\r\n\r\n“Damn officers of State!” says he; “that’s what Whigs are always\r\nhurrahing for.”\r\n\r\n“Now, don’t swear so, Jeff,” says I, “you know I belong to the meetin’,\r\nand swearin’ hurts my feelings.”\r\n\r\n“Beg pardon, Aunt ’Becca,” says he; “but I do say it’s enough to make\r\nDr. Goddard swear, to have tax to pay in silver, for nothing only\r\nthat Ford may get his two thousand a year, and Shields his twenty-four\r\nhundred a year, and Carpenter his sixteen hundred a year, and all\r\nwithout ‘danger of loss’ by taking it in State paper. Yes, yes: it’s\r\nplain enough now what these officers of State mean by ‘danger of loss.’\r\nWash, I s’pose, actually lost fifteen hundred dollars out of the three\r\nthousand that two of these ‘officers of State’ let him steal from the\r\ntreasury, by being compelled to take it in State paper. Wonder if we\r\ndon’t have a proclamation before long, commanding us to make up this\r\nloss to Wash in silver.”\r\n\r\nAnd so he went on till his breath run out, and he had to stop. I\r\ncouldn’t think of anything to say just then, and so I begun to look over\r\nthe paper again. “Ay! here’s another proclamation, or something like\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“Another?” says Jeff; “and whose egg is it, pray?”\r\n\r\nI looked to the bottom of it, and read aloud, “Your obedient servant,\r\nJames Shields, Auditor.”\r\n\r\n“Aha!” says Jeff, “one of them same three fellows again. Well read it,\r\nand let’s hear what of it.”\r\n\r\nI read on till I came to where it says, “The object of this measure is\r\nto suspend the collection of the revenue for the current year.”\r\n\r\n“Now stop, now stop!” says he; “that’s a lie a’ready, and I don’t want\r\nto hear of it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, maybe not,” says I.\r\n\r\n“I say it-is-a-lie. Suspend the collection, indeed! Will the collectors,\r\nthat have taken their oaths to make the collection, dare to end it?\r\nIs there anything in law requiring them to perjure themselves at the\r\nbidding of James Shields?\r\n\r\n“Will the greedy gullet of the penitentiary be satisfied with swallowing\r\nhim instead of all of them, if they should venture to obey him? And\r\nwould he not discover some ‘danger of loss,’ and be off about the time\r\nit came to taking their places?\r\n\r\n“And suppose the people attempt to suspend, by refusing to pay; what\r\nthen? The collectors would just jerk up their horses and cows, and the\r\nlike, and sell them to the highest bidder for silver in hand, without\r\nvaluation or redemption. Why, Shields didn’t believe that story himself;\r\nit was never meant for the truth. If it was true, why was it not writ\r\ntill five days after the proclamation? Why did n’t Carlin and Carpenter\r\nsign it as well as Shields? Answer me that, Aunt ’Becca. I say it’s a\r\nlie, and not a well told one at that. It grins out like a copper dollar.\r\nShields is a fool as well as a liar. With him truth is out of the\r\nquestion; and as for getting a good, bright, passable lie out of him,\r\nyou might as well try to strike fire from a cake of tallow. I stick to\r\nit, it’s all an infernal Whig lie!”\r\n\r\n“A Whig lie! Highty tighty!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, a Whig lie; and it’s just like everything the cursed British Whigs\r\ndo. First they’ll do some divilment, and then they’ll tell a lie to hide\r\nit. And they don’t care how plain a lie it is; they think they can cram\r\nany sort of a one down the throats of the ignorant Locofocos, as they\r\ncall the Democrats.”\r\n\r\n“Why, Jeff, you ’re crazy: you don’t mean to say Shields is a Whig!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do.”\r\n\r\n“Why, look here! the proclamation is in your own Democratic paper, as\r\nyou call it.”\r\n\r\n“I know it; and what of that? They only printed it to let us Democrats\r\nsee the deviltry the Whigs are at.”\r\n\r\n“Well, but Shields is the auditor of this Loco—I mean this Democratic\r\nState.”\r\n\r\n“So he is, and Tyler appointed him to office.”\r\n\r\n“Tyler appointed him?”\r\n\r\n“Yes (if you must chaw it over), Tyler appointed him; or, if it was n’t\r\nhim, it was old Granny Harrison, and that’s all one. I tell you, Aunt\r\n’Becca, there’s no mistake about his being a Whig. Why, his very looks\r\nshows it; everything about him shows it: if I was deaf and blind, I\r\ncould tell him by the smell. I seed him when I was down in Springfield\r\nlast winter. They had a sort of a gatherin’ there one night among the\r\ngrandees, they called a fair. All the gals about town was there, and all\r\nthe handsome widows and married women, finickin’ about trying to look\r\nlike gals, tied as tight in the middle, and puffed out at both ends,\r\nlike bundles of fodder that had n’t been stacked yet, but wanted\r\nstackin’ pretty bad. And then they had tables all around the house\r\nkivered over with [———] caps and pincushions and ten thousand such\r\nlittle knick-knacks, tryin’ to sell ’em to the fellows that were bowin’,\r\nand scrapin’ and kungeerin’ about ’em. They would n’t let no Democrats\r\nin, for fear they’d disgust the ladies, or scare the little gals, or\r\ndirty the floor. I looked in at the window, and there was this same\r\nfellow Shields floatin’ about on the air, without heft or earthly\r\nsubstances, just like a lock of cat fur where cats had been fighting.\r\n\r\n“He was paying his money to this one, and that one, and t’ other one,\r\nand sufferin’ great loss because it was n’t silver instead of State\r\npaper; and the sweet distress he seemed to be in,—his very features,\r\nin the ecstatic agony of his soul, spoke audibly and distinctly, ‘Dear\r\ngirls, it is distressing, but I cannot marry you all. Too well I know\r\nhow much you suffer; but do, do remember, it is not my fault that I am\r\nso handsome and so interesting.’\r\n\r\n“As this last was expressed by a most exquisite contortion of his face,\r\nhe seized hold of one of their hands, and squeezed, and held on to it\r\nabout a quarter of an hour. ‘Oh, my good fellow!’ says I to myself, ‘if\r\nthat was one of our Democratic gals in the Lost Townships, the way you\r\n’d get a brass pin let into you would be about up to the head.’ He a\r\nDemocrat! Fiddlesticks! I tell you, Aunt ’Becca, he’s a Whig, and no\r\nmistake; nobody but a Whig could make such a conceity dunce of himself.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” says I, “maybe he is; but, if he is, I ’m mistaken the worst\r\nsort. Maybe so, maybe so; but, if I am, I’ll suffer by it; I’ll be a\r\nDemocrat if it turns out that Shields is a Whig, considerin’ you shall\r\nbe a Whig if he turns out a Democrat.”\r\n\r\n“A bargain, by jingoes!” says he; “but how will we find out?”\r\n\r\n“Why,” says I, “we’ll just write and ax the printer.”\r\n\r\n“Agreed again!” says he; “and by thunder! if it does turn out that\r\nShields is a Democrat, I never will——”\r\n\r\n“Jefferson! Jefferson!”\r\n\r\n“What do you want, Peggy?”\r\n\r\n“Do get through your everlasting clatter some time, and bring me a gourd\r\nof water; the child’s been crying for a drink this livelong hour.”\r\n\r\n“Let it die, then; it may as well die for water as to be taxed to death\r\nto fatten officers of State.”\r\n\r\nJeff run off to get the water, though, just like he hadn’t been saying\r\nanything spiteful, for he’s a raal good-hearted fellow, after all, once\r\nyou get at the foundation of him.\r\n\r\nI walked into the house, and, “Why, Peggy,” says I, “I declare we like\r\nto forgot you altogether.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” says she, “when a body can’t help themselves, everybody soon\r\nforgets ’em; but, thank God! by day after to-morrow I shall be well\r\nenough to milk the cows, and pen the calves, and wring the contrary\r\nones’ tails for ’em, and no thanks to nobody.”\r\n\r\n“Good evening, Peggy,” says I, and so I sloped, for I seed she was mad\r\nat me for making Jeff neglect her so long.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Mr. Printer, will you be sure to let us know in your next paper\r\nwhether this Shields is a Whig or a Democrat? I don’t care about it for\r\nmyself, for I know well enough how it is already; but I want to convince\r\nJeff. It may do some good to let him, and others like him, know who\r\nand what these officers of State are. It may help to send the present\r\nhypocritical set to where they belong, and to fill the places they now\r\ndisgrace with men who will do more work for less pay, and take fewer\r\nairs while they are doing it. It ain’t sensible to think that the same\r\nmen who get us in trouble will change their course; and yet it’s pretty\r\nplain if some change for the better is not made, it’s not long that\r\neither Peggy or I or any of us will have a cow left to milk, or a calf’s\r\ntail to wring.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nREBECCA ———.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINVITATION TO HENRY CLAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., Aug 29, 1842.\r\n\r\nHON. HENRY CLAY, Lexington, Ky.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:—We hear you are to visit Indianapolis, Indiana, on the 5th Of\r\nOctober next. If our information in this is correct we hope you will\r\nnot deny us the pleasure of seeing you in our State. We are aware of the\r\ntoil necessarily incident to a journey by one circumstanced as you are;\r\nbut once you have embarked, as you have already determined to do, the\r\ntoil would not be greatly augmented by extending the journey to our\r\ncapital. The season of the year will be most favorable for good roads,\r\nand pleasant weather; and although we cannot but believe you would be\r\nhighly gratified with such a visit to the prairie-land, the pleasure it\r\nwould give us and thousands such as we is beyond all question. You have\r\nnever visited Illinois, or at least this portion of it; and should you\r\nnow yield to our request, we promise you such a reception as shall be\r\nworthy of the man on whom are now turned the fondest hopes of a great\r\nand suffering nation.\r\n\r\nPlease inform us at the earliest convenience whether we may expect you.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully your obedient servants,\r\n\r\n   A. G. HENRY, A. T. BLEDSOE,\r\n   C. BIRCHALL, A. LINCOLN,\r\n   G. M. CABANNISS, ROB’T IRWIN,\r\n   P. A. SAUNDERS, J. M. ALLEN,\r\n   F. N. FRANCIS.\r\n   Executive Committee “Clay Club.”\r\n\r\n(Clay’s answer, September 6, 1842, declines with thanks.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORRESPONDENCE ABOUT THE LINCOLN-SHIELDS DUEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREMONT, September 17, 1842.\r\n\r\nABRA. LINCOLN, ESQ.:—I regret that my absence on public business\r\ncompelled me to postpone a matter of private consideration a little\r\nlonger than I could have desired. It will only be necessary, however, to\r\naccount for it by informing you that I have been to Quincy on business\r\nthat would not admit of delay. I will now state briefly the reasons of\r\nmy troubling you with this communication, the disagreeable nature of\r\nwhich I regret, as I had hoped to avoid any difficulty with any one in\r\nSpringfield while residing there, by endeavoring to conduct myself in\r\nsuch a way amongst both my political friends and opponents as to escape\r\nthe necessity of any. Whilst thus abstaining from giving provocation,\r\nI have become the object of slander, vituperation, and personal abuse,\r\nwhich were I capable of submitting to, I would prove myself worthy of\r\nthe whole of it.\r\n\r\nIn two or three of the last numbers of the Sangamon Journal, articles\r\nof the most personal nature and calculated to degrade me have made their\r\nappearance. On inquiring, I was informed by the editor of that paper,\r\nthrough the medium of my friend General Whitesides, that you are the\r\nauthor of those articles. This information satisfies me that I have\r\nbecome by some means or other the object of your secret hostility. I\r\nwill not take the trouble of inquiring into the reason of all this;\r\nbut I will take the liberty of requiring a full, positive, and\r\nabsolute retraction of all offensive allusions used by you in these\r\ncommunications, in relation to my private character and standing as a\r\nman, as an apology for the insults conveyed in them.\r\n\r\nThis may prevent consequences which no one will regret more than myself.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant, JAS. SHIELDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. SHIELDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREMONT, September 17, 1842\r\n\r\nJAS. SHIELDS, ESQ.:—Your note of to-day was handed me by General\r\nWhitesides. In that note you say you have been informed, through the\r\nmedium of the editor of the Journal, that I am the author of certain\r\narticles in that paper which you deem personally abusive of you; and\r\nwithout stopping to inquire whether I really am the author, or to point\r\nout what is offensive in them, you demand an unqualified retraction of\r\nall that is offensive, and then proceed to hint at consequences.\r\n\r\nNow, sir, there is in this so much assumption of facts and so much of\r\nmenace as to consequences, that I cannot submit to answer that note any\r\nfurther than I have, and to add that the consequences to which I suppose\r\nyou allude would be matter of as great regret to me as it possibly could\r\nto you.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A. LINCOLN FROM JAS. SHIELDS\r\n\r\n\r\nTREMONT, September 17, 1842.\r\n\r\nABRA. LINCOLN, ESQ.:—In reply to my note of this date, you intimate\r\nthat I assume facts and menace consequences, and that you cannot submit\r\nto answer it further. As now, sir, you desire it, I will be a little\r\nmore particular. The editor of the Sangamon Journal gave me to\r\nunderstand that you are the author of an article which appeared, I\r\nthink, in that paper of the 2d September instant, headed “The Lost\r\nTownships,” and signed Rebecca or ’Becca. I would therefore take the\r\nliberty of asking whether you are the author of said article, or any\r\nother over the same signature which has appeared in any of the late\r\nnumbers of that paper. If so, I repeat my request of an absolute\r\nretraction of all offensive allusions contained therein in relation to\r\nmy private character and standing. If you are not the author of any of\r\nthese articles, your denial will be sufficient. I will say further, it\r\nis not my intention to menace, but to do myself justice.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant, JAS. SHIELDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM OF INSTRUCTIONS TO E. H. MERRYMAN,\r\n\r\n\r\nLincoln’s Second,\r\n\r\nSeptember 19, 1842.\r\n\r\nIn case Whitesides shall signify a wish to adjust this affair without\r\nfurther difficulty, let him know that if the present papers be\r\nwithdrawn, and a note from Mr. Shields asking to know if I am the author\r\nof the articles of which he complains, and asking that I shall make him\r\ngentlemanly satisfaction if I am the author, and this without menace, or\r\ndictation as to what that satisfaction shall be, a pledge is made that\r\nthe following answer shall be given:\r\n\r\n“I did write the ‘Lost Townships’ letter which appeared in the Journal\r\nof the 2d instant, but had no participation in any form in any other\r\narticle alluding to you. I wrote that wholly for political effect—I had\r\nno intention of injuring your personal or private character or standing\r\nas a man or a gentleman; and I did not then think, and do not now think,\r\nthat that article could produce or has produced that effect against you;\r\nand had I anticipated such an effect I would have forborne to write it.\r\nAnd I will add that your conduct toward me, so far as I know, had always\r\nbeen gentlemanly; and that I had no personal pique against you, and no\r\ncause for any.”\r\n\r\nIf this should be done, I leave it with you to arrange what shall\r\nand what shall not be published. If nothing like this is done, the\r\npreliminaries of the fight are to be—\r\n\r\nFirst. Weapons: Cavalry broadswords of the largest size, precisely\r\nequal in all respects, and such as now used by the cavalry company at\r\nJacksonville.\r\n\r\nSecond. Position: A plank ten feet long, and from nine to twelve inches\r\nbroad, to be firmly fixed on edge, on the ground, as the line between\r\nus, which neither is to pass his foot over upon forfeit of his life.\r\nNext a line drawn on the ground on either side of said plank and\r\nparallel with it, each at the distance of the whole length of the sword\r\nand three feet additional from the plank; and the passing of his own\r\nsuch line by either party during the fight shall be deemed a surrender\r\nof the contest.\r\n\r\nThird. Time: On Thursday evening at five o’clock, if you can get it so;\r\nbut in no case to be at a greater distance of time than Friday evening\r\nat five o’clock.\r\n\r\nFourth. Place: Within three miles of Alton, on the opposite side of the\r\nriver, the particular spot to be agreed on by you.\r\n\r\nAny preliminary details coming within the above rules you are at liberty\r\nto make at your discretion; but you are in no case to swerve from these\r\nrules, or to pass beyond their limits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSHUA F. SPEED.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, October 4, 1842.\r\n\r\nDEAR SPEED:—You have heard of my duel with Shields, and I have now\r\nto inform you that the dueling business still rages in this city. Day\r\nbefore yesterday Shields challenged Butler, who accepted, and proposed\r\nfighting next morning at sunrise in Bob Allen’s meadow, one hundred\r\nyards’ distance, with rifles. To this Whitesides, Shields’s second, said\r\n“No,” because of the law. Thus ended duel No. 2. Yesterday Whitesides\r\nchose to consider himself insulted by Dr. Merryman, so sent him a kind\r\nof quasi-challenge, inviting him to meet him at the Planter’s House in\r\nSt. Louis on the next Friday, to settle their difficulty. Merryman made\r\nme his friend, and sent Whitesides a note, inquiring to know if he meant\r\nhis note as a challenge, and if so, that he would, according to the\r\nlaw in such case made and provided, prescribe the terms of the meeting.\r\nWhitesides returned for answer that if Merryman would meet him at the\r\nPlanter’s House as desired, he would challenge him. Merryman replied in\r\na note that he denied Whitesides’s right to dictate time and place, but\r\nthat he (Merryman) would waive the question of time, and meet him at\r\nLouisiana, Missouri. Upon my presenting this note to Whitesides and\r\nstating verbally its contents, he declined receiving it, saying he had\r\nbusiness in St. Louis, and it was as near as Louisiana. Merryman\r\nthen directed me to notify Whitesides that he should publish the\r\ncorrespondence between them, with such comments as he thought fit. This\r\nI did. Thus it stood at bedtime last night. This morning Whitesides, by\r\nhis friend Shields, is praying for a new trial, on the ground that\r\nhe was mistaken in Merryman’s proposition to meet him at Louisiana,\r\nMissouri, thinking it was the State of Louisiana. This Merryman hoots\r\nat, and is preparing his publication; while the town is in a ferment,\r\nand a street fight somewhat anticipated.\r\n\r\nBut I began this letter not for what I have been writing, but to\r\nsay something on that subject which you know to be of such infinite\r\nsolicitude to me. The immense sufferings you endured from the first days\r\nof September till the middle of February you never tried to conceal from\r\nme, and I well understood. You have now been the husband of a lovely\r\nwoman nearly eight months. That you are happier now than the day you\r\nmarried her I well know, for without you could not be living. But I have\r\nyour word for it, too, and the returning elasticity of spirits which is\r\nmanifested in your letters. But I want to ask a close question, “Are\r\nyou now in feeling as well as judgment glad that you are married as you\r\nare?” From anybody but me this would be an impudent question, not to\r\nbe tolerated; but I know you will pardon it in me. Please answer it\r\nquickly, as I am impatient to know. I have sent my love to your Fanny so\r\noften, I fear she is getting tired of it. However, I venture to tender\r\nit again.\r\n\r\nYours forever,\r\n\r\nLINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES S. IRWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, November 2, 1842.\r\n\r\nJAS. S. IRWIN ESQ.:\r\n\r\nOwing to my absence, yours of the 22nd ult. was not received till this\r\nmoment. Judge Logan and myself are willing to attend to any business\r\nin the Supreme Court you may send us. As to fees, it is impossible to\r\nestablish a rule that will apply in all, or even a great many cases.\r\nWe believe we are never accused of being very unreasonable in this\r\nparticular; and we would always be easily satisfied, provided we could\r\nsee the money—but whatever fees we earn at a distance, if not paid\r\nbefore, we have noticed, we never hear of after the work is done. We,\r\ntherefore, are growing a little sensitive on that point.\r\n\r\nYours etc.,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1843\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESOLUTIONS AT A WHIG MEETING AT SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, MARCH 1, 1843.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of the meeting was stated by Mr. Lincoln of Springfield, who\r\noffered the following resolutions, which were unanimously adopted:\r\n\r\nResolved, That a tariff of duties on imported goods, producing\r\nsufficient revenue for the payment of the necessary expenditures of the\r\nNational Government, and so adjusted as to protect American industry, is\r\nindispensably necessary to the prosperity of the American people.\r\n\r\nResolved, That we are opposed to direct taxation for the support of the\r\nNational Government.\r\n\r\nResolved, That a national bank, properly restricted, is highly necessary\r\nand proper to the establishment and maintenance of a sound currency, and\r\nfor the cheap and safe collection, keeping, and disbursing of the public\r\nrevenue.\r\n\r\nResolved, That the distribution of the proceeds of the sales of the\r\npublic lands, upon the principles of Mr. Clay’s bill, accords with the\r\nbest interests of the nation, and particularly with those of the State\r\nof Illinois.\r\n\r\nResolved, That we recommend to the Whigs of each Congressional district\r\nof the State to nominate and support at the approaching election a\r\ncandidate of their own principles, regardless of the chances of success.\r\n\r\nResolved, That we recommend to the Whigs of all portions of the State\r\nto adopt and rigidly adhere to the convention system of nominating\r\ncandidates.\r\n\r\nResolved, That we recommend to the Whigs of each Congressional district\r\nto hold a district convention on or before the first Monday of May next,\r\nto be composed of a number of delegates from each county equal to double\r\nthe number of its representatives in the General Assembly, provided,\r\neach county shall have at least one delegate. Said delegates to be\r\nchosen by primary meetings of the Whigs, at such times and places as\r\nthey in their respective counties may see fit. Said district conventions\r\neach to nominate one candidate for Congress, and one delegate to\r\na national convention for the purpose of nominating candidates for\r\nPresident and Vice-President of the United States. The seven delegates\r\nso nominated to a national convention to have power to add two delegates\r\nto their own number, and to fill all vacancies.\r\n\r\nResolved, That A. T. Bledsoe, S. T. Logan, and A. Lincoln be appointed a\r\ncommittee to prepare an address to the people of the State.\r\n\r\nResolved, That N. W. Edwards, A. G. Henry, James H. Matheny, John\r\nC. Doremus, and James C. Conkling be appointed a Whig Central State\r\nCommittee, with authority to fill any vacancy that may occur in the\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCULAR FROM WHIG COMMITTEE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAddress to the People of Illinois.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS:—By a resolution of a meeting of such of the Whigs of\r\nthe State as are now at Springfield, we, the undersigned, were appointed\r\nto prepare an address to you. The performance of that task we now\r\nundertake.\r\n\r\nSeveral resolutions were adopted by the meeting; and the chief object of\r\nthis address is to show briefly the reasons for their adoption.\r\n\r\nThe first of those resolutions declares a tariff of duties upon foreign\r\nimportations, producing sufficient revenue for the support of the\r\nGeneral Government, and so adjusted as to protect American industry, to\r\nbe indispensably necessary to the prosperity of the American people;\r\nand the second declares direct taxation for a national revenue to\r\nbe improper. Those two resolutions are kindred in their nature, and\r\ntherefore proper and convenient to be considered together. The question\r\nof protection is a subject entirely too broad to be crowded into a\r\nfew pages only, together with several other subjects. On that point we\r\ntherefore content ourselves with giving the following extracts from\r\nthe writings of Mr. Jefferson, General Jackson, and the speech of Mr.\r\nCalhoun:\r\n\r\n“To be independent for the comforts of life, we must fabricate them\r\nourselves. We must now place the manufacturer by the side of the\r\nagriculturalist. The grand inquiry now is, Shall we make our own\r\ncomforts, or go without them at the will of a foreign nation? He,\r\ntherefore, who is now against domestic manufactures must be for reducing\r\nus either to dependence on that foreign nation, or to be clothed in\r\nskins and to live like wild beasts in dens and caverns. I am not one of\r\nthose; experience has taught me that manufactures are now as necessary\r\nto our independence as to our comfort.” Letter of Mr. Jefferson to\r\nBenjamin Austin.\r\n\r\n“I ask, What is the real situation of the agriculturalist? Where has the\r\nAmerican farmer a market for his surplus produce? Except for cotton, he\r\nhas neither a foreign nor a home market. Does not this clearly prove,\r\nwhen there is no market at home or abroad, that there [is] too much\r\nlabor employed in agriculture? Common sense at once points out the\r\nremedy. Take from agriculture six hundred thousand men, women, and\r\nchildren, and you will at once give a market for more breadstuffs than\r\nall Europe now furnishes. In short, we have been too long subject to the\r\npolicy of British merchants. It is time we should become a little\r\nmore Americanized, and instead of feeding the paupers and laborers\r\nof England, feed our own; or else in a short time, by continuing our\r\npresent policy, we shall all be rendered paupers ourselves.”—General\r\nJackson’s Letter to Dr. Coleman.\r\n\r\n“When our manufactures are grown to a certain perfection, as they soon\r\nwill be, under the fostering care of government, the farmer will find\r\na ready market for his surplus produce, and—what is of equal\r\nconsequence—a certain and cheap supply of all he wants; his prosperity\r\nwill diffuse itself to every class of the community.” Speech of Hon. J.\r\nC. Calhoun on the Tariff.\r\n\r\nThe question of revenue we will now briefly consider. For several\r\nyears past the revenues of the government have been unequal to its\r\nexpenditures, and consequently loan after loan, sometimes direct and\r\nsometimes indirect in form, has been resorted to. By this means a\r\nnew national debt has been created, and is still growing on us with\r\na rapidity fearful to contemplate—a rapidity only reasonably to be\r\nexpected in time of war. This state of things has been produced by a\r\nprevailing unwillingness either to increase the tariff or resort to\r\ndirect taxation. But the one or the other must come. Coming expenditures\r\nmust be met, and the present debt must be paid; and money cannot always\r\nbe borrowed for these objects. The system of loans is but temporary in\r\nits nature, and must soon explode. It is a system not only ruinous while\r\nit lasts, but one that must soon fail and leave us destitute. As an\r\nindividual who undertakes to live by borrowing soon finds his original\r\nmeans devoured by interest, and, next, no one left to borrow from, so\r\nmust it be with a government.\r\n\r\nWe repeat, then, that a tariff sufficient for revenue, or a direct tax,\r\nmust soon be resorted to; and, indeed, we believe this alternative is\r\nnow denied by no one. But which system shall be adopted? Some of our\r\nopponents, in theory, admit the propriety of a tariff sufficient for\r\na revenue, but even they will not in practice vote for such a tariff;\r\nwhile others boldly advocate direct taxation. Inasmuch, therefore, as\r\nsome of them boldly advocate direct taxation, and all the rest—or so\r\nnearly all as to make exceptions needless—refuse to adopt the tariff,\r\nwe think it is doing them no injustice to class them all as advocates\r\nof direct taxation. Indeed, we believe they are only delaying an open\r\navowal of the system till they can assure themselves that the people\r\nwill tolerate it. Let us, then, briefly compare the two systems. The\r\ntariff is the cheaper system, because the duties, being collected in\r\nlarge parcels at a few commercial points, will require comparatively few\r\nofficers in their collection; while by the direct-tax system the land\r\nmust be literally covered with assessors and collectors, going forth\r\nlike swarms of Egyptian locusts, devouring every blade of grass and\r\nother green thing. And, again, by the tariff system the whole revenue is\r\npaid by the consumers of foreign goods, and those chiefly the luxuries,\r\nand not the necessaries, of life. By this system the man who contents\r\nhimself to live upon the products of his own country pays nothing at\r\nall. And surely that country is extensive enough, and its products\r\nabundant and varied enough, to answer all the real wants of its people.\r\nIn short, by this system the burthen of revenue falls almost entirely on\r\nthe wealthy and luxurious few, while the substantial and laboring many\r\nwho live at home, and upon home products, go entirely free. By the\r\ndirect-tax system none can escape. However strictly the citizen may\r\nexclude from his premises all foreign luxuries,—fine cloths, fine\r\nsilks, rich wines, golden chains, and diamond rings,—still, for\r\nthe possession of his house, his barn, and his homespun, he is to be\r\nperpetually haunted and harassed by the tax-gatherer. With these views\r\nwe leave it to be determined whether we or our opponents are the more\r\ntruly democratic on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe third resolution declares the necessity and propriety of a national\r\nbank. During the last fifty years so much has been said and written both\r\nas to the constitutionality and expediency of such an institution, that\r\nwe could not hope to improve in the least on former discussions of the\r\nsubject, were we to undertake it. We, therefore, upon the question of\r\nconstitutionality content ourselves with remarking the facts that the\r\nfirst national bank was established chiefly by the same men who formed\r\nthe Constitution, at a time when that instrument was but two years old,\r\nand receiving the sanction, as President, of the immortal Washington;\r\nthat the second received the sanction, as President, of Mr. Madison,\r\nto whom common consent has awarded the proud title of “Father of the\r\nConstitution”; and subsequently the sanction of the Supreme Court, the\r\nmost enlightened judicial tribunal in the world. Upon the question of\r\nexpediency, we only ask you to examine the history of the times during\r\nthe existence of the two banks, and compare those times with the\r\nmiserable present.\r\n\r\nThe fourth resolution declares the expediency of Mr. Clay’s land bill.\r\nMuch incomprehensible jargon is often used against the constitutionality\r\nof this measure. We forbear, in this place, attempting an answer to it,\r\nsimply because, in our opinion, those who urge it are through party\r\nzeal resolved not to see or acknowledge the truth. The question of\r\nexpediency, at least so far as Illinois is concerned, seems to us the\r\nclearest imaginable. By the bill we are to receive annually a large sum\r\nof money, no part of which we otherwise receive. The precise annual sum\r\ncannot be known in advance; it doubtless will vary in different years.\r\nStill it is something to know that in the last year—a year of almost\r\nunparalleled pecuniary pressure—it amounted to more than forty thousand\r\ndollars. This annual income, in the midst of our almost insupportable\r\ndifficulties, in the days of our severest necessity, our political\r\nopponents are furiously resolving to take and keep from us. And for\r\nwhat? Many silly reasons are given, as is usual in cases where a single\r\ngood one is not to be found. One is that by giving us the proceeds\r\nof the lands we impoverish the national treasury, and thereby render\r\nnecessary an increase of the tariff. This may be true; but if so, the\r\namount of it only is that those whose pride, whose abundance of means,\r\nprompt them to spurn the manufactures of our country, and to strut in\r\nBritish cloaks and coats and pantaloons, may have to pay a few cents\r\nmore on the yard for the cloth that makes them. A terrible evil, truly,\r\nto the Illinois farmer, who never wore, nor ever expects to wear, a\r\nsingle yard of British goods in his whole life. Another of their reasons\r\nis that by the passage and continuance of Mr. Clay’s bill, we prevent\r\nthe passage of a bill which would give us more. This, if it were sound\r\nin itself, is waging destructive war with the former position; for if\r\nMr. Clay’s bill impoverishes the treasury too much, what shall be said\r\nof one that impoverishes it still more? But it is not sound in itself.\r\nIt is not true that Mr. Clay’s bill prevents the passage of one more\r\nfavorable to us of the new States. Considering the strength and opposite\r\ninterest of the old States, the wonder is that they ever permitted one\r\nto pass so favorable as Mr. Clay’s. The last twenty-odd years’ efforts\r\nto reduce the price of the lands, and to pass graduation bills and\r\ncession bills, prove the assertion to be true; and if there were no\r\nexperience in support of it, the reason itself is plain. The States\r\nin which none, or few, of the public lands lie, and those consequently\r\ninterested against parting with them except for the best price, are\r\nthe majority; and a moment’s reflection will show that they must ever\r\ncontinue the majority, because by the time one of the original new\r\nStates (Ohio, for example) becomes populous and gets weight in Congress,\r\nthe public lands in her limits are so nearly sold out that in every\r\npoint material to this question she becomes an old State. She does not\r\nwish the price reduced, because there is none left for her citizens\r\nto buy; she does not wish them ceded to the States in which they lie,\r\nbecause they no longer lie in her limits, and she will get nothing\r\nby the cession. In the nature of things, the States interested in\r\nthe reduction of price, in graduation, in cession, and in all similar\r\nprojects, never can be the majority. Nor is there reason to hope that\r\nany of them can ever succeed as a Democratic party measure, because we\r\nhave heretofore seen that party in full power, year after year,\r\nwith many of their leaders making loud professions in favor of these\r\nprojects, and yet doing nothing. What reason, then, is there to believe\r\nthey will hereafter do better? In every light in which we can view this\r\nquestion, it amounts simply to this: Shall we accept our share of the\r\nproceeds under Mr. Clay’s bill, or shall we rather reject that and get\r\nnothing?\r\n\r\nThe fifth resolution recommends that a Whig candidate for Congress be\r\nrun in every district, regardless of the chances of success. We are\r\naware that it is sometimes a temporary gratification, when a friend\r\ncannot succeed, to be able to choose between opponents; but we believe\r\nthat that gratification is the seed-time which never fails to be\r\nfollowed by a most abundant harvest of bitterness. By this policy we\r\nentangle ourselves. By voting for our opponents, such of us as do it\r\nin some measure estop ourselves to complain of their acts, however\r\nglaringly wrong we may believe them to be. By this policy no one portion\r\nof our friends can ever be certain as to what course another portion\r\nmay adopt; and by this want of mutual and perfect understanding our\r\npolitical identity is partially frittered away and lost. And, again,\r\nthose who are thus elected by our aid ever become our bitterest\r\npersecutors. Take a few prominent examples. In 1830 Reynolds was elected\r\nGovernor; in 1835 we exerted our whole strength to elect Judge Young\r\nto the United States Senate, which effort, though failing, gave him the\r\nprominence that subsequently elected him; in 1836 General Ewing, was so\r\nelected to the United States Senate; and yet let us ask what three men\r\nhave been more perseveringly vindictive in their assaults upon all our\r\nmen and measures than they? During the last summer the whole State\r\nwas covered with pamphlet editions of misrepresentations against us,\r\nmethodized into chapters and verses, written by two of these same\r\nmen,—Reynolds and Young, in which they did not stop at charging us with\r\nerror merely, but roundly denounced us as the designing enemies of\r\nhuman liberty, itself. If it be the will of Heaven that such men shall\r\npolitically live, be it so; but never, never again permit them to draw a\r\nparticle of their sustenance from us.\r\n\r\nThe sixth resolution recommends the adoption of the convention system\r\nfor the nomination of candidates. This we believe to be of the very\r\nfirst importance. Whether the system is right in itself we do not stop\r\nto inquire; contenting ourselves with trying to show that, while our\r\nopponents use it, it is madness in us not to defend ourselves with\r\nit. Experience has shown that we cannot successfully defend ourselves\r\nwithout it. For examples, look at the elections of last year. Our\r\ncandidate for governor, with the approbation of a large portion of the\r\nparty, took the field without a nomination, and in open opposition to\r\nthe system. Wherever in the counties the Whigs had held conventions and\r\nnominated candidates for the Legislature, the aspirants who were not\r\nnominated were induced to rebel against the nominations, and to become\r\ncandidates, as is said, “on their own hook.” And, go where you would\r\ninto a large Whig county, you were sure to find the Whigs not contending\r\nshoulder to shoulder against the common enemy, but divided into\r\nfactions, and fighting furiously with one another. The election came,\r\nand what was the result? The governor beaten, the Whig vote being\r\ndecreased many thousands since 1840, although the Democratic vote\r\nhad not increased any. Beaten almost everywhere for members of the\r\nLegislature,—Tazewell, with her four hundred Whig majority, sending a\r\ndelegation half Democratic; Vermillion, with her five hundred, doing\r\nthe same; Coles, with her four hundred, sending two out of three; and\r\nMorgan, with her two hundred and fifty, sending three out of four,—and\r\nthis to say nothing of the numerous other less glaring examples; the\r\nwhole winding up with the aggregate number of twenty-seven Democratic\r\nrepresentatives sent from Whig counties. As to the senators, too, the\r\nresult was of the same character. And it is most worthy to be remembered\r\nthat of all the Whigs in the State who ran against the regular nominees,\r\na single one only was elected. Although they succeeded in defeating\r\nthe nominees almost by scores, they too were defeated, and the spoils\r\nchucklingly borne off by the common enemy.\r\n\r\nWe do not mention the fact of many of the Whigs opposing the convention\r\nsystem heretofore for the purpose of censuring them. Far from it.\r\nWe expressly protest against such a conclusion. We know they were\r\ngenerally, perhaps universally, as good and true Whigs as we ourselves\r\nclaim to be.\r\n\r\nWe mention it merely to draw attention to the disastrous result it\r\nproduced, as an example forever hereafter to be avoided. That “union is\r\nstrength” is a truth that has been known, illustrated, and declared in\r\nvarious ways and forms in all ages of the world. That great fabulist and\r\nphilosopher Aesop illustrated it by his fable of the bundle of sticks;\r\nand he whose wisdom surpasses that of all philosophers has declared\r\nthat “a house divided against itself cannot stand.” It is to induce our\r\nfriends to act upon this important and universally acknowledged truth\r\nthat we urge the adoption of the convention system. Reflection will\r\nprove that there is no other way of practically applying it. In its\r\napplication we know there will be incidents temporarily painful; but,\r\nafter all, those incidents will be fewer and less intense with than\r\nwithout the system. If two friends aspire to the same office it is\r\ncertain that both cannot succeed. Would it not, then, be much less\r\npainful to have the question decided by mutual friends some time before,\r\nthan to snarl and quarrel until the day of election, and then both be\r\nbeaten by the common enemy?\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this subject, we think proper to remark that we do not\r\nunderstand the resolution as intended to recommend the application of\r\nthe convention system to the nomination of candidates for the small\r\noffices no way connected with politics; though we must say we do not\r\nperceive that such an application of it would be wrong.\r\n\r\nThe seventh resolution recommends the holding of district conventions\r\nin May next, for the purpose of nominating candidates for Congress. The\r\npropriety of this rests upon the same reasons with that of the sixth,\r\nand therefore needs no further discussion.\r\n\r\nThe eighth and ninth also relate merely to the practical application of\r\nthe foregoing, and therefore need no discussion.\r\n\r\nBefore closing, permit us to add a few reflections on the present\r\ncondition and future prospects of the Whig party. In almost all the\r\nStates we have fallen into the minority, and despondency seems to\r\nprevail universally among us. Is there just cause for this? In 1840 we\r\ncarried the nation by more than a hundred and forty thousand majority.\r\nOur opponents charged that we did it by fraudulent voting; but whatever\r\nthey may have believed, we know the charge to be untrue. Where, now, is\r\nthat mighty host? Have they gone over to the enemy? Let the results of\r\nthe late elections answer. Every State which has fallen off from the\r\nWhig cause since 1840 has done so not by giving more Democratic votes\r\nthan they did then, but by giving fewer Whig. Bouck, who was elected\r\nDemocratic Governor of New York last fall by more than 15,000 majority,\r\nhad not then as many votes as he had in 1840, when he was beaten by\r\nseven or eight thousand. And so has it been in all the other States\r\nwhich have fallen away from our cause. From this it is evident that tens\r\nof thousands in the late elections have not voted at all. Who and what\r\nare they? is an important question, as respects the future. They can\r\ncome forward and give us the victory again. That all, or nearly all, of\r\nthem are Whigs is most apparent. Our opponents, stung to madness by\r\nthe defeat of 1840, have ever since rallied with more than their usual\r\nunanimity. It has not been they that have been kept from the polls.\r\nThese facts show what the result must be, once the people again rally\r\nin their entire strength. Proclaim these facts, and predict this result;\r\nand although unthinking opponents may smile at us, the sagacious ones\r\nwill “believe and tremble.” And why shall the Whigs not all rally again?\r\nAre their principles less dear now than in 1840? Have any of their\r\ndoctrines since then been discovered to be untrue? It is true, the\r\nvictory of 1840 did not produce the happy results anticipated; but it\r\nis equally true, as we believe, that the unfortunate death of General\r\nHarrison was the cause of the failure. It was not the election of\r\nGeneral Harrison that was expected to produce happy effects, but the\r\nmeasures to be adopted by his administration. By means of his death,\r\nand the unexpected course of his successor, those measures were never\r\nadopted. How could the fruits follow? The consequences we always\r\npredicted would follow the failure of those measures have followed, and\r\nare now upon us in all their horrors. By the course of Mr. Tyler the\r\npolicy of our opponents has continued in operation, still leaving them\r\nwith the advantage of charging all its evils upon us as the results of\r\na Whig administration. Let none be deceived by this somewhat plausible,\r\nthough entirely false charge. If they ask us for the sufficient and\r\nsound currency we promised, let them be answered that we only promised\r\nit through the medium of a national bank, which they, aided by Mr.\r\nTyler, prevented our establishing. And let them be reminded, too, that\r\ntheir own policy in relation to the currency has all the time been, and\r\nstill is, in full operation. Let us then again come forth in our might,\r\nand by a second victory accomplish that which death prevented in the\r\nfirst. We can do it. When did the Whigs ever fail if they were fully\r\naroused and united? Even in single States, under such circumstances,\r\ndefeat seldom overtakes them. Call to mind the contested elections\r\nwithin the last few years, and particularly those of Moore and Letcher\r\nfrom Kentucky, Newland and Graham from North Carolina, and the famous\r\nNew Jersey case. In all these districts Locofocoism had stalked\r\nomnipotent before; but when the whole people were aroused by its\r\nenormities on those occasions, they put it down, never to rise again.\r\n\r\nWe declare it to be our solemn conviction, that the Whigs are always a\r\nmajority of this nation; and that to make them always successful needs\r\nbut to get them all to the polls and to vote unitedly. This is the great\r\ndesideratum. Let us make every effort to attain it. At every election,\r\nlet every Whig act as though he knew the result to depend upon his\r\naction. In the great contest of 1840 some more than twenty one hundred\r\nthousand votes were cast, and so surely as there shall be that many,\r\nwith the ordinary increase added, cast in 1844 that surely will a Whig\r\nbe elected President of the United States.\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN. S. T. LOGAN. A. T. BLEDSOE.\r\n\r\nMarch 4, 1843.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN BENNETT.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, March 7, 1843.\r\n\r\nFRIEND BENNETT:\r\n\r\nYour letter of this day was handed me by Mr. Miles. It is too late now\r\nto effect the object you desire. On yesterday morning the most of the\r\nWhig members from this district got together and agreed to hold the\r\nconvention at Tremont in Tazewell County. I am sorry to hear that any\r\nof the Whigs of your county, or indeed of any county, should longer\r\nbe against conventions. On last Wednesday evening a meeting of all the\r\nWhigs then here from all parts of the State was held, and the question\r\nof the propriety of conventions was brought up and fully discussed, and\r\nat the end of the discussion a resolution recommending the system of\r\nconventions to all the Whigs of the State was unanimously adopted.\r\nOther resolutions were also passed, all of which will appear in the next\r\nJournal. The meeting also appointed a committee to draft an address\r\nto the people of the State, which address will also appear in the next\r\njournal.\r\n\r\nIn it you will find a brief argument in favor of conventions—and\r\nalthough I wrote it myself I will say to you that it is conclusive upon\r\nthe point and can not be reasonably answered. The right way for you to\r\ndo is hold your meeting and appoint delegates any how, and if there be\r\nany who will not take part, let it be so. The matter will work so well\r\nthis time that even they who now oppose will come in next time.\r\n\r\nThe convention is to be held at Tremont on the 5th of April and\r\naccording to the rule we have adopted your county is to have\r\ndelegates—being double your representation.\r\n\r\nIf there be any good Whig who is disposed to stick out against\r\nconventions get him at least to read the arguement in their favor in the\r\naddress.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSHUA F. SPEED.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, March 24, 1843.\r\n\r\nDEAR SPEED:—We had a meeting of the Whigs of the county here on last\r\nMonday to appoint delegates to a district convention; and Baker beat me,\r\nand got the delegation instructed to go for him. The meeting, in spite\r\nof my attempt to decline it, appointed me one of the delegates; so that\r\nin getting Baker the nomination I shall be fixed a good deal like a\r\nfellow who is made a groomsman to a man that has cut him out and is\r\nmarrying his own dear “gal.” About the prospects of your having a\r\nnamesake at our town, can’t say exactly yet.\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MARTIN M. MORRIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., March 26, 1843.\r\n\r\nFRIEND MORRIS:\r\n\r\nYour letter of the a 3 d, was received on yesterday morning, and for\r\nwhich (instead of an excuse, which you thought proper to ask) I tender\r\nyou my sincere thanks. It is truly gratifying to me to learn that, while\r\nthe people of Sangamon have cast me off, my old friends of Menard, who\r\nhave known me longest and best, stick to me. It would astonish, if\r\nnot amuse, the older citizens to learn that I (a stranger, friendless,\r\nuneducated, penniless boy, working on a flatboat at ten dollars per\r\nmonth) have been put down here as the candidate of pride, wealth, and\r\naristocratic family distinction. Yet so, chiefly, it was. There was,\r\ntoo, the strangest combination of church influence against me. Baker is\r\na Campbellite; and therefore, as I suppose, with few exceptions got all\r\nthat church. My wife has some relations in the Presbyterian churches,\r\nand some with the Episcopal churches; and therefore, wherever it would\r\ntell, I was set down as either the one or the other, while it was\r\neverywhere contended that no Christian ought to go for me, because I\r\nbelonged to no church, was suspected of being a deist, and had talked\r\nabout fighting a duel. With all these things, Baker, of course, had\r\nnothing to do. Nor do I complain of them. As to his own church going\r\nfor him, I think that was right enough, and as to the influences I\r\nhave spoken of in the other, though they were very strong, it would be\r\ngrossly untrue and unjust to charge that they acted upon them in a body\r\nor were very near so. I only mean that those influences levied a tax\r\nof a considerable per cent. upon my strength throughout the religious\r\ncontroversy. But enough of this.\r\n\r\nYou say that in choosing a candidate for Congress you have an equal\r\nright with Sangamon, and in this you are undoubtedly correct. In\r\nagreeing to withdraw if the Whigs of Sangamon should go against me, I\r\ndid not mean that they alone were worth consulting, but that if she,\r\nwith her heavy delegation, should be against me, it would be impossible\r\nfor me to succeed, and therefore I had as well decline. And in relation\r\nto Menard having rights, permit me fully to recognize them, and to\r\nexpress the opinion that, if she and Mason act circumspectly, they will\r\nin the convention be able so far to enforce their rights as to decide\r\nabsolutely which one of the candidates shall be successful. Let me show\r\nthe reason of this. Hardin, or some other Morgan candidate, will get\r\nPutnam, Marshall, Woodford, Tazewell, and Logan—making sixteen. Then\r\nyou and Mason, having three, can give the victory to either side.\r\n\r\nYou say you shall instruct your delegates for me, unless I object. I\r\ncertainly shall not object. That would be too pleasant a compliment for\r\nme to tread in the dust. And besides, if anything should happen (which,\r\nhowever, is not probable) by which Baker should be thrown out of the\r\nfight, I would be at liberty to accept the nomination if I could get\r\nit. I do, however, feel myself bound not to hinder him in any way from\r\ngetting the nomination. I should despise myself were I to attempt it.\r\nI think, then, it would be proper for your meeting to appoint three\r\ndelegates and to instruct them to go for some one as the first choice,\r\nsome one else as a second, and perhaps some one as a third; and if in\r\nthose instructions I were named as the first choice, it would gratify me\r\nvery much. If you wish to hold the balance of power, it is important for\r\nyou to attend to and secure the vote of Mason also: You should be sure\r\nto have men appointed delegates that you know you can safely confide in.\r\nIf yourself and James Short were appointed from your county, all would\r\nbe safe; but whether Jim’s woman affair a year ago might not be in the\r\nway of his appointment is a question. I don’t know whether you know it,\r\nbut I know him to be as honorable a man as there is in the world. You\r\nhave my permission, and even request, to show this letter to Short; but\r\nto no one else, unless it be a very particular friend who you know will\r\nnot speak of it.\r\n\r\nYours as ever, A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nP. S Will you write me again?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MARTIN M. MORRIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 14, 1843.\r\n\r\nFRIEND MORRIS:\r\n\r\nI have heard it intimated that Baker has been attempting to get you or\r\nMiles, or both of you, to violate the instructions of the meeting that\r\nappointed you, and to go for him. I have insisted, and still insist,\r\nthat this cannot be true. Surely Baker would not do the like. As well\r\nmight Hardin ask me to vote for him in the convention. Again, it is said\r\nthere will be an attempt to get up instructions in your county requiring\r\nyou to go for Baker. This is all wrong. Upon the same rule, Why\r\nmight not I fly from the decision against me in Sangamon, and get up\r\ninstructions to their delegates to go for me? There are at least twelve\r\nhundred Whigs in the county that took no part, and yet I would as soon\r\nput my head in the fire as to attempt it. Besides, if any one should get\r\nthe nomination by such extraordinary means, all harmony in the district\r\nwould inevitably be lost. Honest Whigs (and very nearly all of them\r\nare honest) would not quietly abide such enormities. I repeat, such an\r\nattempt on Baker’s part cannot be true. Write me at Springfield how the\r\nmatter is. Don’t show or speak of this letter.\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEN. J. J. HARDIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, May 11, 1843.\r\n\r\nFRIEND HARDIN:\r\n\r\nButler informs me that he received a letter from you, in which you\r\nexpressed some doubt whether the Whigs of Sangamon will support you\r\ncordially. You may, at once, dismiss all fears on that subject. We\r\nhave already resolved to make a particular effort to give you the very\r\nlargest majority possible in our county. From this, no Whig of the\r\ncounty dissents. We have many objects for doing it. We make it a matter\r\nof honor and pride to do it; we do it because we love the Whig cause; we\r\ndo it because we like you personally; and last, we wish to convince you\r\nthat we do not bear that hatred to Morgan County that you people have so\r\nlong seemed to imagine. You will see by the journals of this week that\r\nwe propose, upon pain of losing a barbecue, to give you twice as great\r\na majority in this county as you shall receive in your own. I got up the\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\nWho of the five appointed is to write the district address? I did the\r\nlabor of writing one address this year, and got thunder for my reward.\r\nNothing new here.\r\n\r\nYours as ever, A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nP. S.—I wish you would measure one of the largest of those swords we\r\ntook to Alton and write me the length of it, from tip of the point to\r\ntip of the hilt, in feet and inches. I have a dispute about the length.\r\n\r\nA. L.",
