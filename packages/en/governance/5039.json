Truman\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe addresses are separated by three asterisks: ***\r\n\r\nDates of addresses by Harry S. Truman in this eBook:\r\n\r\n  January 21, 1946\r\n  January 6, 1947\r\n  January 7, 1948\r\n  January 5, 1949\r\n  January 4, 1950\r\n  January 8, 1951\r\n  January 9, 1952\r\n  January 7, 1953\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nHarry S. Truman\r\nJanuary 21, 1946\r\n\r\nTo the Congress of the United States:\r\n\r\nA quarter century ago the Congress decided that it could no longer consider\r\nthe financial programs of the various departments on a piecemeal basis.\r\nInstead it has called on the President to present a comprehensive Executive\r\nBudget. The Congress has shown its satisfaction with that method by\r\nextending the budget system and tightening its controls. The bigger and\r\nmore complex the Federal Program, the more necessary it is for the Chief\r\nExecutive to submit a single budget for action by the Congress.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, it is clear that the budgetary program and the general\r\nprogram of the Government are actually inseparable. The president bears the\r\nresponsibility for recommending to the Congress a comprehensive set of\r\nproposals on all Government activities and their financing. In formulating\r\npolicies, as in preparing budgetary estimates, the Nation and the Congress\r\nhave the right to expect the President to adjust and coordinate the views\r\nof the various departments and agencies to form a unified program. And that\r\nprogram requires consideration in connection with the Budget, which is the\r\nannual work program of the Government.\r\n\r\nSince our programs for this period which combines war liquidation with\r\nreconversion to a peacetime economy are inevitably large and numerous it is\r\nimperative that they be planned and executed with the utmost efficiency and\r\nthe utmost economy. We have cut the war program to the maximum extent\r\nconsistent with national security. We have held our peacetime programs to\r\nthe level necessary to our national well-being and the attainment of our\r\npostwar objectives. Where increased programs have been recommended, the\r\nincreases have been held as low as is consistent with these goals. I can\r\nassure the Congress of the necessity of these programs. I can further\r\nassure the Congress that the program as a whole is well within our capacity\r\nto finance it. All the programs I have recommended for action are included\r\nin the Budget figures.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons I have chosen to combine the customary Message on the\r\nState of the Union with the annual Budget Message, and to include in the\r\nBudget not only estimates for functions authorized by the Congress, but\r\nalso for those which I recommend for its action.\r\n\r\nI am also transmitting herewith the Fifth Quarterly Report of the Director\r\nof War Mobilization and Reconversion.[1] It is a comprehensive discussion of\r\nthe present state of the reconversion program and of the immediate and\r\nlong-range needs and recommendations.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The report dated January 1, 1946, and entitled \"Battle for\r\nProduction\" is printed in House Document 398 (79th Cong., 2d sess.).]\r\n\r\nThis constitutes, then, as complete a report as I find it possible to\r\nprepare now. It constitutes a program of government in relation to the\r\nNation's needs.\r\n\r\nWith the growing responsibility of modern government to foster economic\r\nexpansion and to promote conditions that assure full and steady employment\r\nopportunities, it has become necessary to formulate and determine the\r\nGovernment program in the light of national economic conditions as a whole.\r\nIn both the executive and the legislative branches we must make\r\narrangements which will permit us to formulate the Government program in\r\nthat light. Such an approach has become imperative if the American\r\npolitical and economic system is to succeed under the conditions of\r\neconomic instability and uncertainty which we have to face. The Government\r\nneeds to assure business, labor, and agriculture that Government policies\r\nwill take due account of the requirements of a full employment economy. The\r\nlack of that assurance would, I believe, aggravate the economic\r\ninstability.\r\n\r\nWith the passage of a full employment bill which I confidently anticipate\r\nfor the very near future, the executive and legislative branches of\r\ngovernment will be empowered to devote their best talents and resources in\r\nsubsequent years to preparing and acting on such a program.\r\n\r\nI. FROM WAR TO PEACE--THE YEAR\r\n\r\nOF DECISION\r\n\r\nIn his last Message on the State of the Union, delivered one year ago,\r\nPresident Roosevelt said:\r\n\r\n\"This new year of 1945 can be the greatest year of achievement in human\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\"1945 can see the final ending of the Nazi-Fascist reign of terror in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\"1945 can see the closing in of the forces of retribution about the center\r\nof the malignant power of imperialistic Japan.\r\n\r\n\"Most important of all--1945 can and must see the substantial beginning of\r\nthe organization of world peace.\"\r\n\r\nAll those hopes, and more, were fulfilled in the year 1945. It was the\r\ngreatest year of achievement in human history. It saw the end of the\r\nNazi-Fascist terror in Europe, and also the end of the malignant power of\r\nJapan. And it saw the substantial beginning of world organization for\r\npeace. These momentous events became realities because of the steadfast\r\npurpose of the United Nations and of the forces that fought for freedom\r\nunder their flags. The plain fact is that civilization was saved in 1945 by\r\nthe United Nations.\r\n\r\nOur own part in this accomplishment was not the product of any single\r\nservice. Those who fought on land, those who fought on the sea, and those\r\nwho fought in the air deserve equal credit. They were supported by other\r\nmillions in the armed forces who through no fault of their own could not go\r\noverseas and who rendered indispensable service in this country. They were\r\nsupported by millions in all levels of government, including many\r\nvolunteers, whose devoted public service furnished basic organization and\r\nleadership. They were also supported by the millions of Americans in\r\nprivate life--men and women in industry, in commerce, on the farms, and in\r\nall manner of activity on the home front--who contributed their brains and\r\ntheir brawn in arming, equipping, and feeding them. The country was brought\r\nthrough four years of peril by an effort that was truly national in\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nEverlasting tribute and gratitude will be paid by all Americans to those\r\nbrave men who did not come back, who will never come back--the 330,000 who\r\ndied that the Nation might live and progress. All Americans will also\r\nremain deeply conscious of the obligation owed to that larger number of\r\nsoldiers, sailors, and marines who suffered wounds and sickness in their\r\nservice. They may be certain that their sacrifice will never be forgotten\r\nor their needs neglected.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the year 1946 finds the United States strong and\r\ndeservedly confident. We have a record of enormous achievements as a\r\ndemocratic society in solving problems and meeting opportunities as they\r\ndeveloped. We find ourselves possessed of immeasurable advantages--vast and\r\nvaried natural resources; great plants, institutions, and other facilities;\r\nunsurpassed technological and managerial skills; an alert, resourceful, and\r\nable citizenry. We have in the United States Government rich resources in\r\ninformation, perspective, and facilities for doing whatever may be found\r\nnecessary to do in giving support and form to the widespread and\r\ndiversified efforts of all our people.\r\n\r\nAnd for the immediate future the business prospects are generally so\r\nfavorable that there is danger of such feverish and opportunistic activity\r\nthat our grave postwar problems may be neglected. We need to act now with\r\nfull regard for pitfalls; we need to act with foresight and balance. We\r\nshould not be lulled by the immediate alluring prospects into forgetting\r\nthe fundamental complexity of modern affairs, the catastrophe that can come\r\nin this complexity, or the values that can be wrested from it.\r\n\r\nBut the long-range difficulties we face should no more lead to despair than\r\nour immediate business prospects should lead to the optimism which comes\r\nfrom the present short-range prospect. On the foundation of our victory we\r\ncan build a lasting peace, with greater freedom and security for mankind in\r\nour country and throughout the world. We will more certainly do this if we\r\nare constantly aware of the fact that we face crucial issues and prepare\r\nnow to meet them.\r\n\r\nTo achieve success will require both boldness in setting our sights and\r\ncaution in steering our way on an uncharted course. But we have no luxury\r\nof choice. We must move ahead. No return to the past is possible.\r\n\r\nOur Nation has always been a land of great opportunities for those people\r\nof the world who sought to become part of us. Now we have become a land of\r\ngreat responsibilities to all the people of all the world. We must squarely\r\nrecognize and face the fact of those responsibilities. Advances in science,\r\nin communication, in transportation, have compressed the world into a\r\ncommunity. The economic and political health of each member of the world\r\ncommunity bears directly on the economic and political health of each other\r\nmember.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of centuries has brought us to a new era in world history in\r\nwhich manifold relationships between nations must be formalized and\r\ndeveloped in new and intricate ways.\r\n\r\nThe United Nations Organization now being established represents a minimum\r\nessential beginning. It must be developed rapidly and steadily. Its work\r\nmust be amplified to fill in the whole pattern that has been outlined.\r\nEconomic collaboration, for example, already charted, now must be carried\r\non as carefully and as comprehensively as the political and security\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nIt is important that the nations come together as States in the Assembly\r\nand in the Security Council and in the other specialized assemblies and\r\ncouncils that have been and will be arranged. But this is not enough. Our\r\nultimate security requires more than a process of consultation and\r\ncompromise.\r\n\r\nIt requires that we begin now to develop the United Nations Organization as\r\nthe representative of the world as one society. The United Nations\r\nOrganization, if we have the will adequately to staff it and to make it\r\nwork as it should, will provide a great voice to speak constantly and\r\nresponsibly in terms of world collaboration and world well-being.\r\n\r\nThere are many new responsibilities for us as we enter into this new\r\ninternational era. The whole power and will and wisdom of our Government\r\nand of our people should be focused to contribute to and to influence\r\ninternational action. It is intricate, continuing business. Many\r\nconcessions and adjustments will be required.\r\n\r\nThe spectacular progress of science in recent years makes these necessities\r\nmore vivid and urgent. That progress has speeded internal development and\r\nhas changed world relationships so fast that we must realize the fact of a\r\nnew era. It is an era in which affairs have become complex and rich in\r\npromise. Delicate and intricate relationships, involving us all in\r\ncountless ways, must be carefully considered.\r\n\r\nOn the domestic scene, as well as on the international scene, we must lay a\r\nnew and better foundation for cooperation. We face a great peacetime\r\nventure; the challenging venture of a free enterprise economy making full\r\nand effective use of its rich resources and technical advances. This is a\r\nventure in which business, agriculture, and labor have vastly greater\r\nopportunities than heretofore. But they all also have vastly greater\r\nresponsibilities. We will not measure up to those responsibilities by the\r\nsimple return to \"normalcy\" that was tried after the last war.\r\n\r\nThe general objective, on the contrary, is to move forward to find the way\r\nin time of peace to the full utilization and development of our physical\r\nand human resources that were demonstrated so effectively in the war.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this, it is not intended that the Federal Government should\r\ndo things that can be done as well for the Nation by private enterprise, or\r\nby State and local governments. On the contrary, the war has demonstrated\r\nhow effectively we can organize our productive system and develop the\r\npotential abilities of our people by aiding the efforts of private\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nAs we move toward one common objective there will be many and urgent\r\nproblems to meet.\r\n\r\nIndustrial peace between management and labor will have to be\r\nachieved--through the process of collective bargaining--with Government\r\nassistance but not Government compulsion. This is a problem which is the\r\nconcern not only of management, labor, and the Government, but also the\r\nconcern of every one of us.\r\n\r\nPrivate capital and private management are entitled to adequate reward for\r\nefficiency, but business must recognize that its reward results from the\r\nemployment of the resources of the Nation. Business is a public trust and\r\nmust adhere to national standards in the conduct of its affairs. These\r\nstandards include as a minimum the establishment of fair wages and fair\r\nemployment practices.\r\n\r\nLabor also has its own new peacetime responsibilities. Under our collective\r\nbargaining system, which must become progressively more secure, labor\r\nattains increasing political as well as economic power, and this, as with\r\nall power, means increased responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe lives of millions of veterans and war workers will be greatly affected\r\nby the success or failure of our program of war liquidation and\r\nreconversion. Their transition to peacetime pursuits will be determined by\r\nour efforts to break the bottlenecks in key items of production, to make\r\nsurplus property immediately available where it is needed, to maintain an\r\neffective national employment service, and many other reconversion\r\npolicies. Our obligations to the people who won the war will not be paid if\r\nwe fail to prevent inflation and to maintain employment opportunities.\r\n\r\nWhile our peacetime prosperity will be based on the private enterprise the\r\ngovernment can and must assist in many ways. It is the Government's\r\nresponsibility to see that our economic system remains competitive, that\r\nnew businesses have adequate opportunities, and that our national resources\r\nare restored and improved. Government must realize the effect of its\r\noperations on the whole economy. It is the responsibility of Government to\r\ngear its total program to the achievement of full production and full\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\nOur basic objective--toward which all others lead--is to improve the\r\nwelfare of the American people. In addition to economic prosperity, this\r\nmeans that we use social security in the fullest sense of the word. And\r\npeople must be protected from excessive want during old age, sickness, and\r\nunemployment. Opportunities for a good economy and adequate medical care\r\nmust be readily available. Every family should build a decent home. The new\r\neconomic rights to which I have referred on previous occasions is a charter\r\nof economic freedom which seeks to assure that all who will may work toward\r\ntheir own security and the general advancement; that we become a\r\nwell-housed people, a well-nourished people, an educated people, a people\r\nsocially and economically secure, an alert and responsible people.\r\n\r\nThese and other problems which may face us can be met by the cooperation of\r\nall of us in furthering a positive and well-balanced Government program--a\r\nprogram which will further national and international well-being.\r\n\r\nII. THE FEDERAL PROGRAM\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS\r\n\r\nI. FOREIGN POLICY\r\n\r\nThe year 1945 brought with it the final defeat of our enemies. There lies\r\nbefore us now the work of building a just and enduring peace.\r\n\r\nOur most immediate task toward that end is to deprive our enemies\r\ncompletely and forever of their power to start another war. Of even greater\r\nimportance to the preservation of international peace is the need to\r\npreserve the wartime agreement of the United Nations and to direct it into\r\nthe ways of peace.\r\n\r\nLong before our enemies surrendered, the foundations had been laid on which\r\nto continue this unity in the peace to come. The Atlantic meeting in 1941\r\nand the conferences at Casablanca, Quebec, Moscow, Cairo, Tehran, and\r\nDumbarton Oaks each added a stone to the structure.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1945, at Yalta, the three major powers broadened and solidified\r\nthis base of understanding. There fundamental decisions were reached\r\nconcerning the occupation and control of Germany. There also a formula was\r\narrived at for the interim government of the areas in Europe which were\r\nrapidly being wrested from Nazi control. This formula was based on the\r\npolicy of the United States that people be permitted to choose their own\r\nform of government by their own freely expressed choice without\r\ninterference from any foreign source.\r\n\r\nAt Potsdam, in July 1945, Marshal Stalin, Prime Ministers Churchill and\r\nAttlee, and I met to exchange views primarily with respect to Germany. As a\r\nresult, agreements were reached which outlined broadly the policy to be\r\nexecuted by the Allied Control Council. At Potsdam there was also\r\nestablished a Council of Foreign Ministers which convened for the first\r\ntime in London in September. The Council is about to resume its primary\r\nassignment of drawing up treaties of peace with Italy, Rumania, Bulgaria,\r\nHungary, and Finland.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these meetings, and, in accordance with the agreement at\r\nYalta, the Foreign Ministers of Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and the\r\nUnited States conferred together in San Francisco last spring, in Potsdam\r\nin July, in London in September, and in Moscow in December. These meetings\r\nhave been useful in promoting understanding and agreement among the three\r\ngovernments.\r\n\r\nSimply to name all the international meetings and conferences is to suggest\r\nthe size and complexity of the undertaking to prevent international war in\r\nwhich the United States has now enlisted for the duration of history.\r\n\r\nIt is encouraging to know that the common effort of the United Nations to\r\nlearn to live together did not cease with the surrender of our enemies.\r\n\r\nWhen difficulties arise among us, the United States does not propose to\r\nremove them by sacrificing its ideals or its vital interests. Neither do we\r\npropose, however, to ignore the ideals and vital interests of our friends.\r\n\r\nLast February and March an Inter-American Conference on Problems of War and\r\nPeace was held in Mexico City. Among the many significant accomplishments\r\nof that Conference was an understanding that an attack by any country\r\nagainst any one of the sovereign American republics would be considered an\r\nact of aggression against all of them; and that if such an attack were made\r\nor threatened, the American republics would decide jointly, through\r\nconsultations in which each republic has equal representation, what\r\nmeasures they would take for their mutual protection. This agreement\r\nstipulates that its execution shall be in full accord with the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations Organization.\r\n\r\nThe first meeting of the General Assembly of the United Nations now in\r\nprogress in London marks the real beginning of our bold adventure toward\r\nthe preservation of world peace, to which is bound the dearest hope of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nWe have solemnly dedicated ourselves and all our will to the success of the\r\nUnited Nations Organization. For this reason we have sought to insure that\r\nin the peacemaking the smaller nations shall have a voice as well as the\r\nlarger states. The agreement reached at Moscow last month preserves this\r\nopportunity in the making of peace with Italy, Rumania, Bulgaria, Hungary,\r\nand Finland. The United States intends to preserve it when the treaties\r\nwith Germany and Japan are drawn.\r\n\r\nIt will be the continuing policy of the United States to use all its\r\ninfluence to foster, support, and develop the United Nations Organization\r\nin its purpose of preventing international war. If peace is to endure it\r\nmust rest upon justice no less than upon power. The question is how justice\r\namong nations is best achieved. We know from day-to-day experience that the\r\nchance for a just solution is immeasurably increased when everyone directly\r\ninterested is given a voice. That does not mean that each must enjoy an\r\nequal voice, but it does mean that each must be heard.\r\n\r\nLast November, Prime Minister Attlee, Prime Minister MacKenzie King, and I\r\nannounced our proposal that a commission be established within the\r\nframework of the United Nations to explore the problems of effective\r\ninternational control of atomic energy.\r\n\r\nThe Soviet Union, France, and China have joined us in the purpose of\r\nintroducing in the General Assembly a resolution for the establishment of\r\nsuch a commission. Our earnest wish is that the work of this commission go\r\nforward carefully and thoroughly, but with the greatest dispatch. I have\r\ngreat hope for the development of mutually effective safeguards which will\r\npermit the fullest international control of this new atomic force.\r\n\r\nI believe it possible that effective means can be developed through the\r\nUnited Nations Organization to prohibit, outlaw, and prevent the use of\r\natomic energy for destructive purposes.\r\n\r\nThe power which the United States demonstrated during the war is the fact\r\nthat underlies every phase of our relations with other countries. We cannot\r\nescape the responsibility which it thrusts upon us. What we think, plan,\r\nsay, and do is of profound significance to the future of every corner of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nThe great and dominant objective of United States foreign policy is to\r\nbuild and preserve a just peace. The peace we seek is not peace for twenty\r\nyears. It is permanent peace. At a time when massive changes are occurring\r\nwith lightning speed throughout the world, it is often difficult to\r\nperceive how this central objective is best served in one isolated complex\r\nsituation or another. Despite this very real difficulty, there are certain\r\nbasic propositions to which the United States adheres and to which we shall\r\ncontinue to adhere.\r\n\r\nOne proposition is that lasting peace requires genuine understanding and\r\nactive cooperation among the most powerful nations. Another is that even\r\nthe support of the strongest nations cannot guarantee a peace unless it is\r\ninfused with the quality of justice for all nations.\r\n\r\nOn October 27, 1945, I made, in New York City, the following public\r\nstatement of my understanding of the fundamental foreign policy of the\r\nUnited States. I believe that policy to be in accord with the opinion of\r\nthe Congress and of the people of the United States. I believe that that\r\npolicy carries out our fundamental objectives.\r\n\r\n1. We seek no territorial expansion or selfish advantage. We have no plans\r\nfor aggression against any other state, large or small. We have no\r\nobjective which need clash with the peaceful aims of any other nation.\r\n\r\n2. We believe in the eventual return of sovereign rights and\r\nself-government to all peoples who have been deprived of them by force.\r\n\r\n3. We shall approve no territorial changes in any friendly part of the\r\nworld unless they accord with the freely expressed wishes of the people\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n4. We believe that all peoples who are prepared for self-government should\r\nbe permitted to choose their own form of government by their own freely\r\nexpressed choice, without interference from any foreign source. That is\r\ntrue in Europe, in Asia, in Africa, as well as in the Western Hemisphere.\r\n\r\n5. By the combined and cooperative action of our war allies, we shall help\r\nthe defeated enemy states establish peaceful democratic governments of\r\ntheir own free choice. And we shall try to attain a world in which nazism,\r\nfascism, and military aggression cannot exist.\r\n\r\n6. We shall refuse to recognize any government imposed upon any nation by\r\nthe force of any foreign power. In some cases it may be impossible to\r\nprevent forceful imposition of such a government. But the United States\r\nwill not recognize any such government.\r\n\r\n7. We believe that all nations should have the freedom of the seas and\r\nequal rights to the navigation of boundary rivers and waterways and of\r\nrivers and waterways which pass through more than one country.\r\n\r\n8. We believe that all states which are accepted in the society of nations\r\nshould have access on equal terms to the trade and the raw materials of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n9. We believe that the sovereign states of the Western Hemisphere, without\r\ninterference from outside the Western Hemisphere, must work together as\r\ngood neighbors in the solution of their common problems.\r\n\r\n10. We believe that full economic collaboration between all nations, great\r\nand small, is essential to the improvement of living conditions all over\r\nthe world, and to the establishment of freedom from fear and freedom from\r\nwant.\r\n\r\n11. We shall continue to strive to promote freedom of expression and\r\nfreedom of religion throughout the peace-loving areas of the world.\r\n\r\n12. We are convinced that the preservation of peace between nations\r\nrequires a United Nations Organization composed of all the peace-loving\r\nnations of the world who are willing jointly to use force, if necessary, to\r\ninsure peace.\r\n\r\nThat is our foreign policy.\r\n\r\nWe may not always fully succeed in our objectives. There may be instances\r\nwhere the attainment of those objectives is delayed. But we will not give\r\nour full sanction and approval to actions which fly in the face of these\r\nideals.\r\n\r\nThe world has a great stake in the political and economic future of\r\nGermany. The Allied Control Council has now been in operation there for a\r\nsubstantial period of time. It has not met with unqualified success. The\r\naccommodation of varying views of four governments in the day-to-day civil\r\nadministration of occupied territory is a challenging task. In my judgment,\r\nhowever, the Council has made encouraging progress in the face of most\r\nserious difficulties. It is my purpose at the earliest practicable date to\r\ntransfer from military to civilian personnel the execution of United States\r\nparticipation in the government of occupied territory in Europe. We are\r\ndetermined that effective control shall be maintained in Germany until we\r\nare satisfied that the German people have regained the right to a place of\r\nhonor and respect.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the world, a method of international cooperation has\r\nrecently been agreed upon for the treatment of Japan. In this pattern of\r\ncontrol, the United States, with the full approval of its partners, has\r\nretained primary authority and primary responsibility. It will continue to\r\ndo so until the Japanese people, by their own freely expressed choice,\r\nchoose their own form of government.\r\n\r\nOur basic policy in the Far East is to encourage the development of a\r\nstrong, independent, united, and democratic China. That has been the\r\ntraditional policy of the United States.\r\n\r\nAt Moscow the United States, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and\r\nGreat Britain agreed to further this development by supporting the efforts\r\nof the national government and nongovernmental Chinese political elements\r\nin bringing about cessation of civil strife and in broadening the basis of\r\nrepresentation in the Government. That is the policy which General Marshall\r\nis so ably executing today.\r\n\r\nIt is the purpose of the Government of the United States to proceed as\r\nrapidly as is practicable toward the restoration of the sovereignty of\r\nKorea and the establishment of a democratic government by the free choice\r\nof the people of Korea.\r\n\r\nAt the threshold of every problem which confronts us today in international\r\naffairs is the appalling devastation, hunger, sickness, and pervasive human\r\nmisery that mark so many areas of the world.\r\n\r\nBy joining and participating in the work of the United Nations Relief and\r\nRehabilitation Administration the United States has directly recognized and\r\nassumed an obligation to give such relief assistance as is practicable to\r\nmillions of innocent and helpless victims of the war. The Congress has\r\nearned the gratitude of the world by generous financial contributions to\r\nthe United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.\r\n\r\nWe have taken the lead, modest though it is, in facilitating under our\r\nexisting immigration quotas the admission to the United States of refugees\r\nand displaced persons from Europe.\r\n\r\nWe have joined with Great Britain in the organization of a commission to\r\nstudy the problem of Palestine. The Commission is already at work and its\r\nrecommendations will be made at an early date.\r\n\r\nThe members of the United Nations have paid us the high compliment of\r\nchoosing the United States as the site of the United Nations headquarters.\r\nWe shall be host in spirit as well as in fact, for nowhere does there abide\r\na fiercer determination that this peace shall live than in the hearts of\r\nthe American people.\r\n\r\nIt is the hope of all Americans that in time future historians will speak\r\nnot of World War I and World War II, but of the first and last world wars.\r\n\r\n2. FOREIGN ECONOMIC POLICY\r\n\r\nThe foreign economic policy of the United States is designed to promote our\r\nown prosperity, and at the same time to aid in the restoration and\r\nexpansion of world markets and to contribute thereby to world peace and\r\nworld security. We shall continue our efforts to provide relief from the\r\ndevastation of war, to alleviate the sufferings of displaced persons, to\r\nassist in reconstruction and development, and to promote the expansion of\r\nworld trade.\r\n\r\nWe have already joined the International Monetary Fund and the\r\nInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development. We have expanded the\r\nExport-Import Bank and provided it with additional capital. The Congress\r\nhas renewed the Trade Agreements Act which provides the necessary framework\r\nwithin which to negotiate a reduction of trade barriers on a reciprocal\r\nbasis. It has given our support to the United Nations Relief and\r\nRehabilitation Administration.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the intentions of the Congress, lend-lease, except as to\r\ncontinuing military lend-lease in China, was terminated upon the surrender\r\nof Japan. The first of the lend-lease settlement agreements has been\r\ncompleted with the United Kingdom. Negotiations with other lend-lease\r\ncountries are in progress. In negotiating these agreements, we intend to\r\nseek settlements which will not encumber world trade through war debts of a\r\ncharacter that proved to be so detrimental to the stability of the world\r\neconomy after the last war.\r\n\r\nWe have taken steps to dispose of the goods which on VJ-day were in the\r\nlend-lease pipe line to the various lend-lease countries and to allow them\r\nlong-term credit for the purpose where necessary. We are also making\r\narrangements under which those countries may use the lend-lease inventories\r\nin their possession and acquire surplus property abroad to assist in their\r\neconomic rehabilitation and reconstruction. These goods will be accounted\r\nfor at fair values.\r\n\r\nThe proposed loan to the United Kingdom, which I shall recommend to the\r\nCongress in a separate message, will contribute to easing the transition\r\nproblem of one of our major partners in the war. It will enable the whole\r\nsterling area and other countries affiliated with it to resume trade on a\r\nmultilateral basis. Extension of this credit will enable the United Kingdom\r\nto avoid discriminatory trade arrangements of the type which destroyed\r\nfreedom of trade during the 1930's. I consider the progress toward\r\nmultilateral trade which will be achieved by this agreement to be in itself\r\nsufficient warrant for the credit.\r\n\r\nThe view of this Government is that, in the longer run, our economic\r\nprosperity and the prosperity of the whole world are best served by the\r\nelimination of artificial barriers to international trade, whether in the\r\nform of unreasonable tariffs or tariff preferences or commercial quotas or\r\nembargoes or the restrictive practices of cartels.\r\n\r\nThe United States Government has issued proposals for the expansion of\r\nworld trade and employment to which the Government of the United Kingdom\r\nhas given its support on every important issue. These proposals are\r\nintended to form the basis for a trade and employment conference to be held\r\nin the middle of this year. If that conference is a success, I feel\r\nconfident that the way will have been adequately prepared for an expanded\r\nand prosperous world trade.\r\n\r\nWe shall also continue negotiations looking to the full and equitable\r\ndevelopment of facilities for transportation and communications among\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of the nations of the world have chosen to work together\r\nto achieve, on a cooperative basis, world security and world prosperity.\r\nThe effort cannot succeed without full cooperation of the United States. To\r\nplay our part, we must not only resolutely carry out the foreign policies\r\nwe have adopted but also follow a domestic policy which will maintain full\r\nproduction and employment in the United States. A serious depression here\r\ncan disrupt the whole fabric of the world economy.\r\n\r\n3. OCCUPIED COUNTRIES\r\n\r\nThe major tasks of our Military Establishment in Europe following VE-day,\r\nand in the Pacific since the surrender of Japan, have been those of\r\noccupation and military government. In addition we have given much needed\r\naid to the peoples of the liberated countries.\r\n\r\nThe end of the war in Europe found Germany in a chaotic condition.\r\nOrganized government had ceased to exist, transportation systems had been\r\nwrecked, cities and industrial facilities had been bombed into ruins. In\r\naddition to the tasks of occupation we had to assume all of the functions\r\nof government. Great progress has been made in the repatriation of\r\ndisplaced persons and of prisoners of war. Of the total of 3,500,000\r\ndisplaced persons found in the United States zone only 460,000 now remain.\r\n\r\nThe extensive complications involved by the requirement of dealing with\r\nthree other governments engaged in occupation and with the governments of\r\nliberated countries require intensive work and energetic cooperation. The\r\ninflux of some 2 million German refugees into our zone of occupation is a\r\npressing problem, making exacting demands upon an already overstrained\r\ninternal economy.\r\n\r\nImprovements in the European economy during 1945 have made it possible for\r\nour military authorities to relinquish to the governments of all liberated\r\nareas, or to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration,\r\nthe responsibility for the provision of food and other civilian relief\r\nsupplies. The Army's responsibilities in Europe extend now only to our\r\nzones of occupation in Germany and Austria and to two small areas in\r\nnorthern Italy.\r\n\r\nBy contrast with Germany, in Japan we have occupied a country still\r\npossessing an organized and operating governmental system. Although\r\nseverely damaged, the Japanese industrial and transportation systems have\r\nbeen able to insure at least a survival existence for the population. The\r\nrepatriation of Japanese military and civilian personnel from overseas is\r\nproceeding as rapidly as shipping and other means permit.\r\n\r\nIn order to insure that neither Germany nor Japan will again be in a\r\nposition to wage aggressive warfare, the armament making potential of these\r\ncountries is being dismantled and fundamental changes in their social and\r\npolitical structures are being effected. Democratic systems are being\r\nfostered to the end that the voice of the common man may be heard in the\r\ncouncils of his government.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in history the legal culpability of war makers is being\r\ndetermined. The trials now in progress in Nurnberg-and those soon to begin\r\nin Tokyo--bring before the bar of international justice those individuals\r\nwho are charged with the responsibility for the sufferings of the past six\r\nyears. We have high hope that this public portrayal of the guilt of these\r\nevildoers will bring wholesale and permanent revulsion on the part of the\r\nmasses of our former enemies against war, militarism, aggression, and\r\nnotions of race superiority.\r\n\r\n4. DEMOBILIZATION OF OUR ARMED FORCES\r\n\r\nThe cessation of active campaigning does not mean that we can completely\r\ndisband our fighting forces. For their sake and for the sake of their loved\r\nones at home, I wish that we could. But we still have the task of clinching\r\nthe victories we have won--of making certain that Germany and Japan can\r\nnever again wage aggressive warfare, that they will not again have the\r\nmeans to bring on another world war. The performance of that task requires\r\nthat, together with our allies, we occupy the hostile areas, complete the\r\ndisarmament of our enemies, and take the necessary measures to see to it\r\nthat they do not rearm.\r\n\r\nAs quickly as possible, we are bringing about the reduction of our armed\r\nservices to the size required for these tasks of occupation and\r\ndisarmament. The Army and the Navy are following both length-of-service and\r\npoint systems as far as possible in releasing men and women from the\r\nservice. The points are based chiefly on length and character of service,\r\nand on the existence of dependents.\r\n\r\nOver 5 million from the Army have already passed through the separation\r\ncenters.\r\n\r\nThe Navy, including the Marine Corps and the Coast Guard, has discharged\r\nover one and a half million.\r\n\r\nOf the 12 million men and women serving in the Army and Navy at the time of\r\nthe surrender of Germany, one-half have already been released. The greater\r\npart of these had to be brought back to this country from distant parts of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nOf course there are cases of individual hardship in retention of personnel\r\nin the service. There will be in the future. No system of such size can\r\noperate to perfection. But the systems are rounded on fairness and justice,\r\nand they are working at full speed. We shall try to avoid mistakes,\r\ninjustices, and hardship--as far as humanly possible.\r\n\r\nWe have already reached the point where shipping is no longer the\r\nbottleneck in the return of troops from the European theater. The governing\r\nfactor now has become the requirement for troops in sufficient strength to\r\ncarry out their missions.\r\n\r\nIn a few months the same situation will exist in the Pacific. By the end of\r\nJune, 9 out of 10 who were serving in the armed forces on VE-day will have\r\nbeen released. Demobilization will continue thereafter, but at a slower\r\nrate, determined by our military responsibilities.\r\n\r\nOur national safety and the security of the world will require substantial\r\narmed forces, particularly in overseas service. At the same time it is\r\nimperative that we relieve those who have already done their duty, and that\r\nwe relieve them as fast as we can. To do that, the Army and the Navy are\r\nconducting recruiting drives with considerable success.\r\n\r\nThe Army has obtained nearly 400,000 volunteers in the past four months,\r\nand the Navy has obtained 80,000. Eighty percent of these volunteers for\r\nthe regular service have come from those already with the colors. The\r\nCongress has made it possible to offer valuable inducements to those who\r\nare eligible for enlistment. Every effort will be made to enlist the\r\nrequired number of young men.\r\n\r\nThe War and Navy Departments now estimate that by a year from now we still\r\nwill need a strength of about 2 million including officers, for the armed\r\nforces--Army, Navy, and Air. I have reviewed their estimates and believe\r\nthat the safety of the Nation will require the maintenance of an armed\r\nstrength of this size for the calendar year that is before us.\r\n\r\nIn case the campaign for volunteers does not produce that number, it will\r\nbe necessary by additional legislation to extend the Selective Service Act\r\nbeyond May 16, the date of expiration under existing law. That is the only\r\nway we can get the men and bring back our veterans. There is no other way.\r\nAction along this line should not be postponed beyond March, in order to\r\navoid uncertainty and disruption.\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC AFFAIRS\r\n\r\nI. THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK\r\n\r\nProphets of doom predicted that the United States could not escape a\r\nrunaway inflation during the war and an economic collapse after the war.\r\nThese predictions have not been borne out. On the contrary, the record of\r\neconomic stabilization during the war and during the period of reconversion\r\nhas been an outstanding accomplishment.\r\n\r\nWe know, however, that nothing is as dangerous as overconfidence, in war or\r\nin peace. We have had to fight hard to hold the line. We have made\r\nstrenuous efforts to speed reconversion. But neither the danger of a\r\npostwar inflation nor of a subsequent collapse in production and employment\r\nis yet overcome. We must base our policies not on unreasoning optimism or\r\npessimism but upon a candid recognition of our objectives and upon a\r\ncareful analysis of foreseeable trends.\r\n\r\nAny precise appraisal of the economic outlook at this time is particularly\r\ndifficult. The period of demobilization and reconversion is fraught with\r\nuncertainties. There are also serious gaps in our statistical information.\r\nCertain tendencies are, however, fairly clear and recognition of them\r\nshould serve as background for the consideration of next year's Federal\r\nProgram. In general, the outlook for business is good, and it is likely to\r\ncontinue to be good--provided we control inflation and achieve peace in\r\nmanagement labor relations.\r\n\r\nCivilian production and employment can be expected to increase throughout\r\nthe next year. This does not mean, however, that continuing full employment\r\nis assured. It is probable that demobilization of the armed forces will\r\nproceed faster than the increase in civilian employment opportunities. Even\r\nif substantial further withdrawals from the labor market occur,\r\nunemployment will increase temporarily. The extent to which this\r\nunemployment will persist depends largely on the speed of industrial\r\nexpansion and the effectiveness of the policies of the Federal Government.\r\n\r\nAlong with extraordinary demand there are still at this time many critical\r\nshortages resulting from the war. These extraordinary demands and shortages\r\nmay lead to a speculative boom, especially in the price of securities, real\r\nestate, and inventories.\r\n\r\nTherefore, our chief worry still is inflation. While we control this\r\ninflationary pressure we must look forward to the time when this\r\nextraordinary demand will subside. It will be years before we catch up with\r\nthe demand for housing. The extraordinary demand for other durable goods,\r\nfor the replenishment of inventories, and for exports may be satisfied\r\nearlier. No backlog of demand can exist very long in the face of our\r\ntremendous productive capacity. We must expect again to face the problem of\r\nshrinking demand and consequent slackening in sales, production, and\r\nemployment. This possibility of a deflationary spiral in the future will\r\nexist unless we now plan and adopt an effective full employment program.\r\n\r\n2. GENERAL POLICIES--IMMEDIATE AND LONG-RANGE\r\n\r\nDuring the war, production for civilian use was limited by war needs and\r\navailable manpower. Economic stabilization required measures, to spread\r\nlimited supplies equitably by rationing, price controls, increased taxes,\r\nsavings bond campaigns, and credit controls. Now, with the surrender of our\r\nenemies, economic stabilization requires that policies be directed toward\r\npromoting an increase in supplies at low unit prices.\r\n\r\nWe must encourage the development of resources and enterprises in all parts\r\nof the country, particularly in underdeveloped areas. For example, the\r\nestablishment of new peacetime industries in the Western States and in the\r\nSouth would, in my judgment, add to existing production and markets rather\r\nthan merely bring about a shifting of production. I am asking the\r\nSecretaries of Agriculture, Commerce, and Labor to explore jointly methods\r\nfor stimulating new industries, particularly in areas with surplus\r\nagricultural labor.\r\n\r\nWe must also aid small businessmen and particularly veterans who are\r\ncompetent to start their own businesses. The establishment and development\r\nof efficient small business ventures, I believe, will not take away from,\r\nbut rather will add to, the total business of all enterprises.\r\n\r\nEven with maximum encouragement of Production, we cannot hope to remove\r\nscarcities within a short time. The most serious deficiencies will persist\r\nin the fields of residential housing, building materials, and consumers'\r\ndurable goods. The critical situation makes continued rent control, price\r\ncontrol, and priorities, allocations, and inventory controls absolutely\r\nessential. Continued control of consumer credit will help to reduce the\r\npressure on prices of durable goods and will also prolong the period during\r\nwhich the backlog demand will be effective.\r\n\r\nWhile we are meeting these immediate needs we must look forward to a\r\nlong-range program of security and increased standard of living.\r\n\r\nThe best protection of purchasing power is a policy of full production and\r\nfull employment opportunities. Obviously, an employed worker is a better\r\ncustomer than an unemployed worker. There always will be, however, some\r\nfrictional unemployment. In the present period of transition we must deal\r\nwith such temporary unemployment as results from the fact that\r\ndemobilization will proceed faster than reconversion or industrial\r\nexpansion. Such temporary unemployment is probably unavoidable in a period\r\nof rapid change. The unemployed worker is a victim of conditions beyond his\r\ncontrol. He should be enabled to maintain a reasonable standard of living\r\nfor himself and his family.\r\n\r\nThe most serious difficulty in the path of reconversion and expansion is\r\nthe establishment of a fair wage structure.\r\n\r\nThe ability of labor and management to work together, and the wage and\r\nprice policies which they develop, are social and economic issues of first\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nBoth labor and management have a special interest. Labor's interest is very\r\ndirect and personal because working conditions, wages, and prices affect\r\nthe very life and happiness of the worker and his family.\r\n\r\nManagement has a no less direct interest because on management rests the\r\nresponsibility for conducting a growing and prosperous business.\r\n\r\nBut management and labor have identical interests in the long run. Good\r\nwages mean good markets. Good business means more jobs and better wages. In\r\nthis age of cooperation and in our highly organized economy the problems of\r\none very soon become the problems of all.\r\n\r\nBetter human relationships are an urgent need to which organized labor and\r\nmanagement should address themselves. No government policy can make men\r\nunderstand each other, agree, and get along unless they conduct themselves\r\nin a way to foster mutual respect and good will.\r\n\r\nThe Government can, however, help to develop machinery which, with the\r\nbacking of public opinion, will assist labor and management to resolve\r\ntheir disagreements in a peaceful manner and reduce the number and duration\r\nof strikes.\r\n\r\nAll of us realize that productivity--increased output per man--is in the\r\nlong run the basis of our standard of living. Management especially must\r\nrealize that if labor is to work wholeheartedly for an increase in\r\nproduction, workers must be given a just share of increased output in\r\nhigher wages.\r\n\r\nMost industries and most companies have adequate leeway within which to\r\ngrant substantial wage increases. These increases will have a direct effect\r\nin increasing consumer demand to the high levels needed. Substantial wage\r\nincreases are good business for business because they assure a large market\r\nfor their products; substantial wage increases are good business for labor\r\nbecause they increase labor's standard of living; substantial wage\r\nincreases are good business for the country as a whole because capacity\r\nproduction means an active, healthy, friendly citizenry enjoying the\r\nbenefits of democracy under our free enterprise system.\r\n\r\nLabor and management in many industries have been operating successfully\r\nunder the Government's wage-price policy. Upward revisions of wage scales\r\nhave been made in thousands of establishments throughout the Nation since\r\nVJ-day. It is estimated that about 6 million workers, or more than 20\r\npercent of all employees in nonagricultural and nongovernmental\r\nestablishments, have received wage increases since August 18, 1945. The\r\namounts of increases given by individual employers concentrate between 10\r\nand 15 percent, but range from less than 5 percent to over 30 percent.\r\n\r\nThe United States Conciliation Service since VJ-day has settled over 3,000\r\ndisputes affecting over 1,300,000 workers without a strike threat and has\r\nassisted in settling about 1,300 disputes where strikes were threatened\r\nwhich involved about 500,000 workers. Only workers directly involved, and\r\nnot those in related industries who might have been indirectly affected,\r\nare included in these estimates.\r\n\r\nMany of these adjustments have occurred in key industries and would have\r\nseemed to us major crises if they had not been settled peaceably.\r\n\r\nWithin the framework of the wage-price policy there has been definite\r\nsuccess, and it is to be expected that this success will continue in a vast\r\nmajority of the cases arising in the months ahead.\r\n\r\nHowever, everyone who realizes the extreme need for a swift and orderly\r\nreconversion must feel a deep concern about the number of major strikes now\r\nin progress. If long continued, these strikes could put a heavy brake on\r\nour program.\r\n\r\nI have already made recommendations to the Congress as to the procedure\r\nbest adapted to meeting the threat of work stoppages in Nation-wide\r\nindustries without sacrificing the fundamental rights of labor to bargain\r\ncollectively and ultimately to strike in support of their position.\r\n\r\nIf we manage our economy properly, the future will see us on a level of\r\nproduction half again as high as anything we have ever accomplished in\r\npeacetime. Business can in the future pay higher wages and sell for lower\r\nprices than ever before. This is not true now for all companies, nor will\r\nit ever be true for all, but for business generally it is true.\r\n\r\nWe are relying on all concerned to develop, through collective bargaining,\r\nwage structures that are fair to labor, allow for necessary business\r\nincentives, and conform with a policy designed to \"hold the line\" on\r\nprices.\r\n\r\nProduction and more production was the byword during the war and still is\r\nduring the transition from war to peace. However, when deferred demand\r\nslackens, we shall once again face the deflationary dangers which beset\r\nthis and other countries during the 1930's. Prosperity can be assured only\r\nby a high level of demand supported by high current income; it cannot be\r\nsustained by deferred needs and use of accumulated savings.\r\n\r\nIf we take the right steps in time we can certainly avoid the disastrous\r\nexcesses of runaway booms and headlong depressions. We must not let a year\r\nor two of prosperity lull us into a false feeling of security and a\r\nrepetition of the mistakes of the 1920's that culminated in the crash of\r\n1929.\r\n\r\nDuring the year ahead the Government will be called upon to act in many\r\nimportant fields of economic policy from taxation and foreign trade to\r\nsocial security and housing. In every case there will be alternatives. We\r\nmust choose the alternatives which will best measure up to our need for\r\nmaintaining production and employment in the future. We must never lose\r\nsight of our long-term objectives: the broadening of markets--the\r\nmaintenance of steadily rising demand. This demand can come from only three\r\nsources: consumers, businesses, or government.\r\n\r\nIn this country the job of production and distribution is in the hands of\r\nbusinessmen, farmers, workers, and professional people-in the hands of our\r\ncitizens. We want to keep it that way. However, it is the Government's\r\nresponsibility to help business, labor, and farmers do their jobs.\r\n\r\nThere is no question in my mind that the Government, acting on behalf of\r\nall the people, must assume the ultimate responsibility for the economic\r\nhealth of the Nation. There is no other agency that can. No other\r\norganization has the scope or the authority, nor is any other agency\r\naccountable, to all the people. This does not mean that the Government has\r\nthe sole responsibility, nor that it can do the job alone, nor that it can\r\ndo the job directly.\r\n\r\nAll of the policies of the Federal Government must be geared to the\r\nobjective of sustained full production and full employment-to raise\r\nconsumer purchasing power and to encourage business investment. The\r\nprograms we adopt this year and from now on will determine our ability to\r\nachieve our objectives. We must continue to pay particular attention to our\r\nfiscal, monetary, and tax policy, programs to aid business--especially\r\nsmall business--and transportation, labor-management relations and\r\nwage-price policy, social security and health, education, the farm program,\r\npublic works, housing and resource development, and economic foreign\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nFor example, the kinds of tax measures we have at different times--whether\r\nwe raise our revenue in a way to encourage consumer spending and business\r\ninvestment or to discourage it--have a vital bearing on this question. It\r\nis affected also by regulations on consumer credit and by the money market,\r\nwhich is strongly influenced by the rate of interest on Government\r\nsecurities. It is affected by almost every step we take.\r\n\r\nIn short, the way we handle the proper functions of government, the way we\r\ntime the exercise of our traditional and legitimate governmental functions,\r\nhas a vital bearing on the economic health of the Nation.\r\n\r\nThese policies are discussed in greater detail in the accompanying Fifth\r\nQuarterly Report of the Director of War Mobilization and Reconversion.\r\n\r\n3. LEGISLATION HERETOFORE RECOMMENDED\r\n\r\nAND STILL PENDING\r\n\r\nTo attain some of these objectives and to meet the other needs of the\r\nUnited States in the reconversion and postwar period, I have from time to\r\ntime made various recommendations to the Congress.\r\n\r\nIn making these recommendations I have indicated the reasons why I deemed\r\nthem essential for progress at home and abroad. A few--a very few--of these\r\nrecommendations have been enacted into law by the Congress. Most of them\r\nhave not. I here reiterate some of them, and discuss others later in this\r\nMessage. I urge upon the Congress early consideration of them. Some are\r\nmore urgent than others, but all are necessary.\r\n\r\n(1) Legislation to authorize the President to create fact-finding boards\r\nfor the prevention of stoppages of work in Nationwide industries after\r\ncollective bargaining and conciliation and voluntary arbitration have\r\nfailed--as recommended by me on December 3, 1945.\r\n\r\n(2) Enactment of a satisfactory full employment bill such as the Senate\r\nbill now in conference between the Senate and the House--as recommended by\r\nme on September 6, 1945.\r\n\r\n(3) Legislation to supplement the unemployment insurance benefits for\r\nunemployed workers now provided by the different States--as recommended by\r\nme on May 1945.\r\n\r\n(4) Adoption of a permanent Fair Employment Practice Act--as recommended by\r\nme on September 6, 1945.\r\n\r\n(5) Legislation substantially raising the amount of minimum wages now\r\nprovided by law--as recommended by me on September 6, 1945.\r\n\r\n(6) Legislation providing for a comprehensive program for scientific\r\nresearch--as recommended by me on September 6, 1945.\r\n\r\n(7) Legislation enacting a health and medical care program--as recommended\r\nby me on November 19, 1945.\r\n\r\n(8) Legislation adopting the program of universal training--as recommended\r\nby me on October 23, 1945.\r\n\r\n(9) Legislation providing an adequate salary scale for all Government\r\nemployees in all branches of the Government--as recommended by me on\r\nSeptember 6, 1945.\r\n\r\n(10) Legislation making provision for succession to the Presidency in the\r\nevent of the death or incapacity or disqualification of the President and\r\nVice President--as recommended by me on June 19, 1945.\r\n\r\n(11) Legislation for the unification of the armed services--as recommended\r\nby me on December 19, 1945.\r\n\r\n(12) Legislation for the domestic use and control of atomic energy--as\r\nrecommended by me on October 3, 1945.\r\n\r\n(13) Retention of the United States Employment Service in the Federal\r\nGovernment for a period at least up to June 30, 1947--as recommended by me\r\non September 6, 1945.\r\n\r\n(14) Legislation to increase unemployment allowances for veterans in line\r\nwith increases for civilians--as recommended by me on September 6, 1945.\r\n\r\n(15) Social security coverage for veterans for their period of military\r\nservice--as recommended by me on September 6, 1945.\r\n\r\n(16) Extension of crop insurance--as recommended by me on September 6,\r\n1945.\r\n\r\n(17) Legislation permitting the sale of ships by the Maritime Commission at\r\nhome and abroad--as recommended by me on September 6, 1945. I further\r\nrecommend that this legislation include adequate authority for chartering\r\nvessels both here and abroad.\r\n\r\n(18) Legislation to take care of the stock piling of materials in which the\r\nUnited States is naturally deficient--as recommended by me on September 6,\r\n1945.\r\n\r\n(19) Enactment of Federal airport legislation-as recommended by me on\r\nSeptember 6, 1945.\r\n\r\n(20) Legislation repealing the Johnson Act on foreign loans--as recommended\r\nby me on September 6, 1945.\r\n\r\n(21) Legislation for the development of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River\r\nBasin-as recommended by me on October 3, 1945.\r\n\r\n4. POLICIES IN SPECIFIC FIELDS\r\n\r\n(a) Extension of Price Control Act.\r\n\r\nToday inflation is our greatest immediate domestic problem. So far the\r\nfight against inflation has been waged successfully. Since May 1943,\r\nfollowing President Roosevelt's \"hold the line\" order and in the face of\r\nthe greatest pressures which this country has ever seen, the cost of living\r\nindex has risen only three percent. Wholesale prices in this same period\r\nhave been held to an increase of two and one-half percent.\r\n\r\nThis record has been made possible by the vigorous efforts of the agencies\r\nresponsible for this program. But their efforts would have been fruitless\r\nif they had not had the solid support of the great masses of our people.\r\nThe Congress is to be congratulated for its role in providing the\r\nlegislation under which this work has been carried out.\r\n\r\nOn VJ-day it was clear to all thinking people that the danger of inflation\r\nwas by no means over. Many of us can remember vividly our disastrous\r\nexperience following World War I. Then the very restricted wartime controls\r\nwere lifted too quickly, and as a result prices and rents moved more\r\nrapidly upward. In the year and a half following the armistice, rents,\r\nfood, and clothing shot to higher and still higher levels.\r\n\r\nWhen the inevitable crash occurred less than two years after the end of the\r\nwar, business bankruptcies were widespread. Profits were wiped out.\r\nInventory losses amounted to billions of dollars. Farm income dropped by\r\none-half. Factory pay rolls dropped 40 percent, and nearly one-fifth of all\r\nour industrial workers were walking the streets in search of jobs. This was\r\na grim greeting, indeed, to offer our veterans who had just returned from\r\noverseas.\r\n\r\nWhen I addressed the Congress in September, I emphasized that we must\r\ncontinue to hold the price line until the production of goods caught up\r\nwith the tremendous demands. Since then we have seen demonstrated the\r\nstrength of the inflationary pressures which we have to face.\r\n\r\nRetail sales in the closing months of 1945 ran 12 percent above the\r\nprevious peak for that season, which came in 1944. Prices throughout the\r\nentire economy have been pressing hard against the price ceilings. The\r\nprices of real estate, which cannot now be controlled under the law, are\r\nrising rapidly. Commercial rents are not included in the present price\r\ncontrol law and, where they are not controlled by State law, have been\r\nincreasing, causing difficulties to many businessmen.\r\n\r\nIt will be impossible to maintain a high purchasing power or an expanding\r\nproduction unless we can keep prices at levels which can be met by the vast\r\nmajority of our people. Full production is the greatest weapon against\r\ninflation, but until we can produce enough goods to meet the threat of\r\ninflation the Government will have to exercise its wartime control over\r\nprices.\r\n\r\nI am sure that the people of the United States are disturbed by the demands\r\nmade by several business groups with regard to price and rent control.\r\n\r\nI am particularly disturbed at the effect such thinking may have on\r\nproduction and employment. If manufacturers continue to hold back goods and\r\ndecline to submit bids when invited--as I am informed some are doing--in\r\nanticipation of higher prices which would follow the end of price controls,\r\nwe shall inevitably slow down production and create needless unemployment.\r\nOn the other hand, there are the vast majority of American businessmen who\r\nare not holding back goods, but who need certainty about the Government\r\npricing policy in order to fix their own long-range pricing policies.\r\n\r\nBusinessmen are entitled therefore to a dear statement of the policy of the\r\nGovernment on the subject. Tenants and housewives, farmers and\r\nworkers--consumers in general--have an equal right.\r\n\r\nWe are all anxious to eliminate unnecessary controls just as rapidly as we\r\ncan do so. The steps that we have already taken in many directions toward\r\nthat end are a clear indication of our policy.\r\n\r\nThe present Price Control Act expires on June 30, 1946. If we expect to\r\nmaintain a steady economy we shall have to maintain price and rent control\r\nfor many months to come. The inflationary pressures on prices and rents,\r\nwith relatively few exceptions, are now at an all-time peak. Unless the\r\nPrice Control Act is renewed there will be no limit to which our price\r\nlevels would soar. Our country would face a national disaster.\r\n\r\nWe cannot wait to renew the act until immediately before it expires.\r\nInflation results from psychological as well as economic conditions. The\r\ncountry has a clear right to know where the Congress stands on this\r\nall-important problem. Any uncertainty now as to whether the act will be\r\nextended gives rise to price speculation, to withholding of goods from the\r\nmarket in anticipation of rising prices, and to delays in achieving maximum\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nI do not doubt that the Congress will be beset by many groups who will urge\r\nthat the legislation that I have proposed should either be eliminated or\r\nmodified to the point where it is nearly useless. The Congress has a clear\r\nresponsibility to meet this challenge with courage and determination. I\r\nhave every confidence that it will do so.\r\n\r\nI strongly urge that the Congress now resolve all doubts and as soon as\r\npossible adopt legislation continuing rent and price control in effect for\r\na full year from June 30, 1946.\r\n\r\n(b) Food subsidies.\r\n\r\nIf the price line is to be held, if our people are to be protected against\r\nthe inflationary dangers which confront us, we must do more than extend the\r\nPrice Control Act. In September we were hopeful that the inflationary\r\npressures would by this time have begun to diminish. We were particularly\r\nhopeful on food. Indeed, it was estimated that food prices at retail would\r\ndrop from 3 to 5 percent in the first six months following the end of the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of this decline in food prices, it was our belief that food\r\nsubsidies could be removed gradually during the winter and spring months,\r\nand eliminated almost completely by June 30 of this year. It was our\r\nfeeling that the food subsidies could be dropped without an increase to the\r\nconsumer in the present level of food prices or in the over-all cost of\r\nliving.\r\n\r\nAs matters stand today, however, food prices are pressing hard against the\r\nceilings. The expected decline in food prices has not occurred, nor is it\r\nlikely to occur for many months to come. This brings me to the reluctant\r\nconclusion that food subsidies must be continued beyond June 30, 1946.\r\n\r\nIf we fail to take this necessary step, meat prices on July 1 will be from\r\n3 to 5 cents higher than their average present levels; butter will be at\r\nleast 12 cents a pound higher, in addition to the 5 cents a pound increase\r\nof last fall; milk will increase from 1 to 2 cents a quart; bread will\r\nincrease about 1 cent a loaf; sugar will increase over 1 cent a pound;\r\ncheese, in addition to the increase of 4 cents now planned for the latter\r\npart of this month, will go up an additional 8 cents. In terms of\r\npercentages we may find the cost-of-living index for food increased by more\r\nthan 8 percent, which in turn would result in more than a 3-percent\r\nincrease in the cost of living.\r\n\r\nIf prices of food were allowed to increase by these amounts, I must make it\r\nclear to the Congress that, in my opinion, it would become extremely\r\ndifficult for us to control the forces of inflation.\r\n\r\nNone of us likes subsidies. Our farmers, in particular, have always been\r\nopposed to them.\r\n\r\nBut I believe our farmers are as deeply conscious as any group in the land\r\nof the havoc which inflation can create. Certainly in the past eighteen\r\nmonths there has been no group which has fought any harder in support of\r\nthe Government's price control program. I am confident that, if the facts\r\nare placed before them and if they see clearly the evils between which we\r\nare forced to choose, they will understand the reasons why subsidies must\r\nbe continued.\r\n\r\nThe legislation continuing the use of food subsidies into the new fiscal\r\nyear should be tied down specifically to certain standards. A very proper\r\nrequirement, in my opinion, would be that subsidies be removed as soon as\r\nit is indicated that the cost of living will decline below the present\r\nlevels.\r\n\r\n(c) Extension of War Powers Act.\r\n\r\nThe Second War Powers Act has recently been extended by the Congress for\r\nsix months instead of for a year. It will now expire, unless further\r\nextended, on June 30, 1946. This act is the basis for priority and\r\ninventory controls governing the use of scarce materials, as well as for\r\nother powers essential to orderly reconversion.\r\n\r\nI think that this Administration has given adequate proof of the fact that\r\nit desires to eliminate wartime controls as quickly and as expeditiously as\r\npossible. However, we know that there will continue to be shortages of\r\ncertain materials caused by the war even after June 30, 1946. It is\r\nimportant that businessmen know now that materials in short supply are\r\ngoing to be controlled and distributed fairly as long as these war-born\r\nshortages continue.\r\n\r\nI, therefore, urge the Congress soon to extend the Second War Powers Act.\r\nWe cannot afford to wait until just before the act expires next June. To\r\nwait would cause the controls to break down in a short time, and would\r\nhamper our production and employment program.\r\n\r\n(d) Small business and competition.\r\n\r\nA rising birth rate for small business, and a favorable environment for its\r\ngrowth, are not only economic necessities but also important practical\r\ndemonstrations of opportunity in a democratic free society. A great many\r\nveterans and workers with new skills and experience will want to start in\r\nfor themselves. The opportunity must be afforded them to do so. They are\r\nthe small businessmen of the future.\r\n\r\nActually when we talk about small business we are talking about almost all\r\nof the Nation's individual businesses. Nine out of every ten concerns fall\r\ninto this category, and 45 percent of all workers are employed by them.\r\nBetween 30 and 40 percent of the total value of all business transactions\r\nare handled by small business.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious national policy to foster the sound development of small\r\nbusiness. It helps to maintain high levels of employment and national\r\nincome and consumption of the goods and services that the Nation can\r\nproduce. It encourages the competition that keeps our free enterprise\r\neconomy vigorous and expanding. Small business, because of its flexibility,\r\nassists in the rapid exploitation of scientific and technological\r\ndiscoveries. Investment in small business can absorb a large volume of\r\nsavings that might otherwise not be tapped.\r\n\r\nThe Government should encourage and is encouraging small-business\r\ninitiative and originality to stimulate progress through competition.\r\n\r\nDuring the war, the Smaller War Plants Corporation assisted small concerns\r\nto make a maximum contribution to victory. The work of the Smaller War\r\nPlants Corporation is being carried on in peacetime by the Federal Loan\r\nAgency and the Department of Commerce. The fundamental approach to the job\r\nof encouraging small concerns must be based on:\r\n\r\n1. Arrangements for making private and public financial resources available\r\non reasonable terms.\r\n\r\n2. Provision of technical advice and assistance to business as a whole on\r\nproduction, research, and management problems. This will help equalize\r\ncompetitive relationships between large and small companies, for many of\r\nthe small companies cannot afford expensive technical research, accounting,\r\nand tax advice.\r\n\r\n3. Elimination of trade practices and agreements which reduce competition\r\nand discriminate against new or small enterprises.\r\n\r\nWe speak a great deal about the free enterprise economy of our country. It\r\nis competition that keeps it free. It is competition that keeps it growing\r\nand developing. The truth is that we need far more competition in the\r\nfuture than we have had in the immediate past.\r\n\r\nBy strangling competition, monopolistic activity prevents or deters\r\ninvestment in new or expanded production facilities. This lessens the\r\nopportunity for employment and chokes off new outlets for idle savings.\r\nMonopoly maintains prices at artificially high levels and reduces\r\nconsumption which, with lower prices, would rise and support larger\r\nproduction and higher employment. Monopoly, not being subject to\r\ncompetitive pressure, is slow to take advantage of technical advances which\r\nwould lower prices or improve quality. All three of these monopolistic\r\nactivities very directly lower the standard of living--through higher\r\nprices and lower quality of product--which free competition would improve.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Government must protect legitimate business and consumers from\r\npredatory and monopolistic practices by the vigilant enforcement of\r\nregulatory legislation. The program will be designed to have a maximum\r\nimpact upon monopolistic bottlenecks and unfair competitive practices\r\nhindering expansion in employment.\r\n\r\nDuring the war, enforcement of antimonopoly laws was suspended in a number\r\nof fields. The Government must now take major steps not only to maintain\r\nenforcement of antitrust laws but to encourage new and competing\r\nenterprises in every way. The deferred demand of the war years and the\r\nlarge accumulations of liquid assets provide ample incentive for expansion.\r\nEqualizing of business opportunity, under full and free competition, must\r\nbe a prime responsibility in the reconversion period and in the years that\r\nfollow. Many leading businessmen have recognized the importance of such\r\naction both to themselves and to the economy as a whole.\r\n\r\nBut we must do more than break up trusts and monopolies after they have\r\nbegun to strangle competition. We must take positive action to foster new,\r\nexpanding enterprises. By legislation and by administration we must take\r\nspecific steps to discourage the formation or the strengthening of\r\ncompetition-restricting business. We must have an over-all antimonopoly\r\npolicy which can be applied by all agencies of the Government in exercising\r\nthe functions assigned to them--a policy designed to encourage the\r\nformation and growth of new and freely competitive enterprises.\r\n\r\nAmong the many departments and agencies which have parts in the program\r\naffecting business and competition, the Department of Commerce has a\r\nparticularly important role. That is why I have recommended a substantial\r\nincrease in appropriations for the next fiscal year for this Department.\r\n\r\nIn its assistance to industry, the Department of Commerce will concentrate\r\nits efforts on these primary objectives: Promotion of a large and\r\nwell-balanced foreign trade; provision of improved technical assistance and\r\nmanagement aids, especially for small enterprises; and strengthening of\r\nbasic statistics on business operations, both by industries and by regions.\r\nTo make new inventions and discoveries available more promptly to all\r\nbusinesses, small and large, the Department proposes to expand its own\r\nresearch activities, promote research by universities, improve Patent\r\nOffice procedures, and develop a greatly expanded system of field offices\r\nreadily accessible to the businesses they serve.\r\n\r\nMany gaps exist in the private financial mechanism, especially in the\r\nprovision of long-term funds for small- and medium sized enterprises. In\r\nthe peacetime economy the Reconstruction Finance Corporation will take the\r\nleadership in assuring adequate financing for small enterprises which\r\ncannot secure funds from other sources. Most of the funds should and will\r\nbe provided by private lenders; but the Reconstruction Finance Corporation\r\nwill share any unusual risks through guarantees of private loans, with\r\ndirect loans only when private capital is unwilling to participate on a\r\nreasonable basis.\r\n\r\n(e) Minimum wage.\r\n\r\nFull employment and full production may be achieved only by maintaining a\r\nlevel of consumer income far higher than that of the prewar period. A high\r\nlevel of consumer income will maintain the market for the output of our\r\nmills, farms, and factories, which we have demonstrated during the war\r\nyears that we can produce. One of the basic steps which the Congress can\r\ntake to establish a high level of consumer income is to amend the Fair\r\nLabor Standards Act to raise substandard wages to a decent minimum and to\r\nextend similar protection to additional workers who are not covered by the\r\npresent act.\r\n\r\nSubstandard wages are bad for business and for the farmer. Substandard\r\nwages provide only a substandard market for the goods and services produced\r\nby American industry and agriculture.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the Fair Labor Standards Act prescribes a minimum wage\r\nof 40 cents an hour for those workers who are covered by the act. The\r\npresent minimum wage represents an annual income of about $800 to those\r\ncontinuously employed for 50 weeks--clearly a wholly inadequate budget for\r\nan American family. I am in full accord with the proposal now pending in\r\nthe Congress that the statutory minimum be raised immediately to 65 cents\r\nan hour, with further increases to 70 cents after one year and to 75 cents\r\nafter two years. I also favor the proposal that the industry committee\r\nprocedure be used to set rates higher than 65 cents per hour during the\r\ntwo-year interval before the 75-cent basic wage would otherwise become\r\napplicable.\r\n\r\nThe proposed minimum wage of 65 cents an hour would assure the worker an\r\nannual income of about $1,300 a year in steady employment. This amount is\r\nclearly a modest goal. After considering cost-of-living increases in recent\r\nyears, it is little more than a 10-cent increase over the present legal\r\nminimum. In fact, if any large number of workers earn less than this\r\namount, we will find it impossible to maintain the levels of purchasing\r\npower needed to sustain the stable prosperity which we desire. Raising the\r\nminimum to 75 cents an hour will provide the wage earner with an annual\r\nincome of $1,500 if he is fully employed.\r\n\r\nThe proposed higher minimum wage levels are feasible without involving\r\nserious price adjustments or serious geographic dislocations.\r\n\r\nToday about 20 percent of our manufacturing wage earners--or about 2\r\nmillion-earn less than 65 cents an hour. Because wages in most industries\r\nhave risen during the war, this is about the same as the proportion-17\r\npercent--who were earning less than 40 cents an hour in 1941.\r\n\r\nI also recommend that minimum wage protection be extended to several groups\r\nof workers not now covered. The need for a decent standard of living is by\r\nno means limited to those workers who happen to be covered by the act as it\r\nnow stands. It is particularly vital at this period of readjustment in the\r\nnational economy and readjustment in employment of labor to extend minimum\r\nwage protection as far as possible.\r\n\r\nLifting the basic minimum wage is necessary, it is justified as a matter of\r\nsimple equity to workers, and it will prove not only feasible but also\r\ndirectly beneficial to the Nation's employers.\r\n\r\n(f) Agricultural programs.\r\n\r\nThe farmers of America generally are entering the crop year of 1946 in\r\nbetter financial condition than ever before. Farm mortgage debt is the\r\nlowest in 30 years. Farmers' savings are the largest in history. Our\r\nagricultural plant is in much better condition than after World War I. Farm\r\nmachinery and supplies are expected to be available in larger volume, and\r\nfarm labor problems will be less acute.\r\n\r\nThe demand for farm products will continue strong during the next year or\r\ntwo because domestic purchases will be supplemented by a high level of\r\nexports and foreign relief shipments. It is currently estimated that from 7\r\nto 10 percent of the total United States food supply may be exported in the\r\ncalendar year 1946.\r\n\r\nFarm prices are expected to remain at least at their present levels in the\r\nimmediate future, and for at least the next 12 months they are expected to\r\nyield a net farm income double the 1935-39 average and higher than in any\r\nyear prior to 1943.\r\n\r\nWe can look to the future of agriculture with greater confidence than in\r\nmany a year in the past. Agriculture itself is moving confidently ahead,\r\nplanning for another year of big production, taking definite and positive\r\nsteps to lead the way toward an economy of abundance.\r\n\r\nAgricultural production goals for 1946 call for somewhat greater acreage\r\nthan actually was planted in 1945. Agriculture is prepared to demonstrate\r\nthat it can make a peacetime contribution as great as its contribution\r\ntoward the winning of the war.\r\n\r\nIn spite of supplying our armed forces and our allies during the war with a\r\nfifth to a fourth of our total food output, farmers were still able to\r\nprovide our civilians with 8 percent more food per capita than the average\r\nfor the five years preceding the war. Since the surrender of Japan,\r\ncivilian food consumption has risen still further. By the end of 1945 the\r\namount of the increase in food consumption was estimated to be as high as\r\n15 percent over the prewar average. The record shows that the people of\r\nthis country want and need more food and that they will buy more food if\r\nonly they have the jobs and the purchasing power. The first essential\r\ntherefore in providing fully for the welfare of agriculture is to maintain\r\nfull employment and a high level of purchasing power throughout the\r\nNation.\r\n\r\nFor the period immediately ahead we shall still have the problem of\r\nsupplying enough food. If we are to do our part in aiding the war-stricken\r\nand starving countries some of the food desires of our own people will not\r\nbe completely satisfied, at least until these nations have had an\r\nopportunity to harvest another crop. During the next few months the need\r\nfor food in the world will be more serious than at any time during the war.\r\nAnd, despite the large shipments we have already made, and despite what we\r\nshall send, there remain great needs abroad.\r\n\r\nBeyond the relief feeding period, there will still be substantial foreign\r\noutlets for our farm commodities. The chief dependence of the farmer,\r\nhowever, as always, must be upon the buying power of our own people.\r\n\r\nThe first obligation of the Government to agriculture for the reconversion\r\nperiod is to make good on its price-support commitments. This we intend to\r\ndo, with realistic consideration for the sound patterns of production that\r\nwill contribute most to the long-time welfare of agriculture and the whole\r\nNation. The period during which prices are supported will provide an\r\nopportunity for farmers individually to strengthen their position in\r\nchanging over from a wartime to a peacetime basis of production. It will\r\nprovide an opportunity for the Congress to review the needs of agriculture\r\nand make changes in national legislation where experience has shown changes\r\nto be needed. In this connection, the Congress will wish to consider\r\nlegislation to take the place of the 1937 Sugar Act which expires at the\r\nend of this year. During this period we must do a thorough job of basic\r\nplanning to the end that agriculture shall be able to contribute its full\r\nshare toward a healthy national economy.\r\n\r\nOur long-range agricultural policies should have two main objectives:\r\nFirst, to assure the people on the farms a fair share of the national\r\nincome; and, second, to encourage an agricultural production pattern that\r\nis best fitted to the Nation's needs. To accomplish this second objective\r\nwe shall have to take into consideration changes that have taken place and\r\nwill continue to take place in the production of farm commodities--changes\r\nthat affect costs and efficiency and volume.\r\n\r\nWhat we seek ultimately is a high level of food production and consumption\r\nthat will provide good nutrition for everyone. This cannot be accomplished\r\nby agriculture alone. We can be certain of our capacity to produce food,\r\nbut we have often failed to distribute it as well as we should and to see\r\nthat our people can afford to buy it. The way to get good nutrition for the\r\nwhole Nation is to provide employment opportunities and purchasing power\r\nfor all groups that will enable them to buy full diets at market prices.\r\n\r\nWherever purchasing power fails to reach this level we should see that they\r\nhave some means of getting adequate food at prices in line with their\r\nability to buy. Therefore, we should have available supplementary programs\r\nthat will enable all our people to have enough of the right kind of food.\r\n\r\nFor example, one of the best possible contributions toward building a\r\nstronger, healthier Nation would be a permanent school-lunch program on a\r\nscale adequate to assure every school child a good lunch at noon. The\r\nCongress, of course, has recognized this need for a continuing school-lunch\r\nprogram and legislation to that effect has been introduced and hearings\r\nheld. The plan contemplates the attainment of this objective with a minimum\r\nof Federal expenditures. I hope that the legislation will be enacted in\r\ntime for a permanent program to start with the beginning of the school year\r\nnext fall.\r\n\r\nWe have the technical knowledge and the productive capacity to provide\r\nplenty of good food for every man, woman, and child in the United States.\r\nIt is time we made that possibility a reality.\r\n\r\n(g) Resource development.\r\n\r\nThe strength of our Nation and the welfare of the people rest upon the\r\nnatural resources of the country. We have learned that proper conservation\r\nof our lands, including our forests and minerals, and wise management of\r\nour waters will add immensely to our national wealth.\r\n\r\nThe first step in the Government's conservation program must be to find out\r\njust what are our basic resources, and how they should be used. We need to\r\ntake, as soon as possible, an inventory of the lands, the minerals, and the\r\nforests of the Nation.\r\n\r\nDuring the war it was necessary to curtail some of our long-range plans for\r\ndevelopment of our natural resources, and to emphasize programs vital to\r\nthe prosecution of the war. Work was suspended on a number of flood control\r\nand reclamation projects and on the development of our national forests and\r\nparks. This work must now be resumed, and new projects must be undertaken\r\nto provide essential services and to assist in the process of economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThe rivers of America offer a great opportunity to our generation in the\r\nmanagement of the national wealth. By a wise use of Federal funds, most of\r\nwhich will be repaid into the Treasury, the scourge of floods and drought\r\ncan be curbed, water can be brought to arid lands, navigation can be\r\nextended, and cheap power can be brought alike to the farms and to the\r\nindustries of our land.\r\n\r\nThrough the use of the waters of the Columbia River, for example, we are\r\ncreating a rich agricultural area as large as the State of Delaware. At the\r\nsame time, we are producing power at Grand Coulee and at Bonneville which\r\nplayed a mighty part in winning the war and which will found a great\r\npeacetime industry in the Northwest. The Tennessee Valley Authority will\r\nresume its peacetime program of promoting full use of the resources of the\r\nValley. We shall continue our plans for the development of the Missouri\r\nValley, the Arkansas Valley, and the Central Valley of California.\r\n\r\nThe Congress has shown itself alive to the practical requirements for a\r\nbeneficial use of our water resources by providing that preference in the\r\nsale of power be given to farmers' cooperatives and public agencies. The\r\npublic power program thus authorized must continue to be made effective by\r\nbuilding the necessary generating and transmission facilities to furnish\r\nthe maximum of firm power needed at the wholesale markets, which are often\r\ndistant from the dam sites.\r\n\r\nThese great developmental projects will open the frontiers of agriculture,\r\nindustry, and commerce. The employment opportunities thus offered will also\r\ngo far to ease the transition from war to peace.\r\n\r\n(h) Public works.\r\n\r\nDuring the war even urgently needed Federal, State, and local construction\r\nprojects were deferred in order to release sources for war production. In\r\nresuming public works construction, it is desirable to proceed only at a\r\nmoderate rate, since demand for private construction will be abnormally\r\nhigh for some time. Our public works program should be timed to reach its\r\npeak after demand for private construction has begun to taper off.\r\nMeanwhile, however, plans should be prepared if we are to act promptly when\r\nthe present extraordinary private demand begins to run out.\r\n\r\nThe Congress made money available to Federal agencies for their public\r\nworks planning in the fiscal year 1946. I strongly recommend that this\r\npolicy be continued and extended in the fiscal year 1947.\r\n\r\nState and local governments also have an essential role to play in a\r\nnational public works program. In my message of September 6, 1945, I\r\nrecommended that the Congress vote such grants to State and local\r\ngovernments as will insure that each level of government makes its proper\r\ncontribution to a balanced public construction program. Specifically, the\r\nFederal Government should aid State and local governments in planning their\r\nown public works programs, in undertaking projects related to Federal\r\nprograms of regional development, and in constructing such public works as\r\nare necessary to carry out the various policies of the Federal Government.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1945 the Congress made available advances to State and local\r\ngovernments for planning public works projects, and recently made\r\nadditional provision to continue these advances through the fiscal year\r\n1946. I believe that further appropriations will be needed for the same\r\npurpose for the fiscal year 1947.\r\n\r\nThe Congress has already made provision for highway programs. It is now\r\nconsidering legislation which would expand Federal grants and loans in\r\nseveral other fields, including construction of airports, hospital and\r\nhealth centers, housing, water pollution control facilities, and\r\neducational plant facilities. I hope that early action will be taken to\r\nauthorize these Federal programs.\r\n\r\nWith respect to public works of strictly local importance, State and local\r\ngovernments should proceed without Federal assistance except in planning.\r\nThis rule should be subject to review when and if the prospect of highly\r\nadverse general economic developments warrants it.\r\n\r\nAll loans and grants for public works should be planned and administered in\r\nsuch a way that they are brought into accord with the other elements of the\r\nFederal Program.\r\n\r\nOur long-run objective is to achieve a program of direct Federal and\r\nFederally assisted public works which is planned in advance and\r\nsynchronized with business conditions. In this way it can make its greatest\r\ncontribution to general economic stability.\r\n\r\n(1) National housing program.\r\n\r\nLast September I stated in my message to the Congress that housing was high\r\non the list of matters calling for decisive action.\r\n\r\nSince then the housing shortage in countless communities, affecting\r\nmillions of families, has magnified this call to action.\r\n\r\nToday we face both an immediate emergency and a major postwar problem.\r\n\r\nSince VJ-day the wartime housing shortage has been growing steadily worse\r\nand pressure on real estate values has increased. Returning veterans often\r\ncannot find a satisfactory place for their families to live, and many who\r\nbuy have to pay exorbitant prices. Rapid demobilization inevitably means\r\nfurther overcrowding.\r\n\r\nA realistic and practical attack on the emergency will require aggressive\r\naction by local governments, with Federal aid, to exploit all opportunities\r\nand to give the veterans as far as possible first chance at vacancies. It\r\nwill require continuation of rent control in shortage areas as well as\r\nlegislation to permit control of sales prices. It will require maximum\r\nconversion of temporary war units for veterans' housing and their\r\ntransportation to communities with the most pressing needs; the Congress\r\nhas already appropriated funds for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe inflation in the price of housing is growing daily.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the housing shortage, it is inevitable that the present\r\ndangers of inflation in home values will continue unless the Congress takes\r\naction in the immediate future.\r\n\r\nLegislation is now pending in the Congress which would provide for ceiling\r\nprices for old and new houses. The authority to fix such ceilings is\r\nessential. With such authority, our veterans and other prospective home\r\nowners would be protected against a skyrocketing of home prices. The\r\ncountry would be protected from the extension of the present inflation in\r\nhome values which, if allowed to continue, will threaten not only the\r\nstabilization program but our opportunities for attaining a sustained high\r\nlevel of home construction.\r\n\r\nSuch measures are necessary stopgaps-but only stopgaps. This emergency\r\naction, taken alone, is good--but not enough. The housing shortage did not\r\nstart with the war or with demobilization; it began years before that and\r\nhas steadily accumulated. The speed with which the Congress establishes the\r\nfoundation for a permanent, long-range housing program will determine how\r\neffectively we grasp the immense opportunity to achieve our goal of decent\r\nhousing and to make housing a major instrument of continuing prosperity and\r\nfull employment in the years ahead. It will determine whether we move\r\nforward to a stable and healthy housing enterprise and toward providing a\r\ndecent home for every American family.\r\n\r\nProduction is the only fully effective answer. To get the wheels turning, I\r\nhave appointed an emergency housing expediter. I have approved\r\nestablishment of priorities designed to assure an ample share of scarce\r\nmaterials to builders of houses for which veterans will have preference.\r\nAdditional price and wage adjustments will be made where necessary, and\r\nother steps will be taken to stimulate greater production of bottleneck\r\nitems. I recommend consideration of every sound method for expansion in\r\nfacilities for insurance of privately financed housing by the Federal\r\nHousing Administration and resumption of previously authorized low-rent\r\npublic housing projects suspended during the war.\r\n\r\nIn order to meet as many demands of the emergency situation as possible, a\r\nprogram of emergency measures is now being formulated for action. These\r\nwill include steps in addition to those already taken. As quickly as this\r\nprogram can be formulated, announcement will be made.\r\n\r\nLast September I also outlined to the Congress the basic principles for the\r\nkind of decisive, permanent legislation necessary for a long-range housing\r\nprogram.\r\n\r\nThese principles place paramount the fact that housing construction and\r\nfinancing for the overwhelming majority of our citizens should be done by\r\nprivate enterprise. They contemplate also that we afford governmental\r\nencouragement to privately financed house construction for families of\r\nmoderate income, through extension of the successful system of insurance of\r\nhousing investment; that research be undertaken to develop better and\r\ncheaper methods of building homes; that communities be assisted in\r\nappraising their housing needs; that we commence a program of Federal aid,\r\nwith fair local participation, to stimulate and promote the rebuilding and\r\nredevelopment of slums and blighted areas--with maximum use of private\r\ncapital. It is equally essential that we use public funds to assist\r\nfamilies of low income who could not otherwise enjoy adequate housing, and\r\nthat we quicken our rate of progress in rural housing.\r\n\r\nLegislation now under consideration by the Congress provides for a\r\ncomprehensive attack jointly by private enterprise, State and local\r\nauthorities, and the Federal Government. This legislation would make\r\npermanent the National Housing Agency and give it authority and funds for\r\nmuch needed technical and economic research. It would provide additional\r\nstimulus for privately financed housing construction. This stimulus\r\nconsists of establishing a new system of yield insurance to encourage\r\nlarge-scale investment in rental housing and broadening the insuring powers\r\nof the Federal Housing Administration and the lending powers of the Federal\r\nsavings and loan associations.\r\n\r\nWhere private industry cannot build, the Government must step in to do the\r\njob. The bill would encourage expansion in housing available for the lowest\r\nincome groups by continuing to provide direct subsidies for low-rent\r\nhousing and rural housing. It would facilitate land assembly for urban\r\nredevelopment by loans and contributions to local public agencies where the\r\nlocalities do their share.\r\n\r\nPrompt enactment of permanent housing legislation along these lines will\r\nnot interfere with the emergency action already under way. On the contrary,\r\nit would lift us out of a potentially perpetual state of housing emergency.\r\nIt would offer the best hope and prospect to millions of veterans and other\r\nAmerican families that the American system can offer more to them than\r\ntemporary makeshifts.\r\n\r\nI have said before that the people of the United States can be the best\r\nhoused people in the world. I repeat that assertion, and I welcome the\r\ncooperation of the Congress in achieving that goal.\r\n\r\n(j) Social security and health.\r\n\r\nOur Social Security System has just celebrated its tenth anniversary.\r\nDuring the past decade this program has supported the welfare and morale of\r\na large part of our people by removing some of the hazards and hardships of\r\nthe aged, the unemployed, and widows and dependent children.\r\n\r\nBut, looking back over 10 years' experience and ahead to the future, we\r\ncannot fail to see defects and serious inadequacies in our system as it now\r\nexists. Benefits are in many cases inadequate; a great many persons are\r\nexcluded from coverage; and provision has not been made for social\r\ninsurance to cover the cost of medical care and the earnings lost by the\r\nsick and the disabled.\r\n\r\nIn the field of old-age security, there seems to be no adequate reason for\r\nexcluding such groups as the self-employed, agricultural and domestic\r\nworkers, and employees of nonprofit organizations. Since many of these\r\ngroups earn wages too low to permit significant savings for old age, they\r\nare in special need of the assured income that can be provided by old-age\r\ninsurance.\r\n\r\nWe must take urgent measures for the readjustment period ahead. The\r\nCongress for some time has been considering legislation designed to\r\nsupplement at Federal expense, during the immediate reconversion period,\r\ncompensation payments to the unemployed. Again I urge the Congress to enact\r\nlegislation liberalizing unemployment compensation benefits and extending\r\nthe coverage. Providing for the sustained consumption by the unemployed\r\npersons and their families is more than a welfare policy; it is sound\r\neconomic policy. A sustained high level of consumer purchases is a basic\r\ningredient of a prosperous economy.\r\n\r\nDuring the war, nearly 5 million men were rejected for military service\r\nbecause of physical or mental defects which in many cases might have been\r\nprevented or corrected. This is shocking evidence that large sections of\r\nthe population are at substandard levels of health. The need for a program\r\nthat will give everyone opportunity for medical care is obvious. Nor can\r\nthere be any serious doubt of the Government's responsibility for helping\r\nin this human and social problem.\r\n\r\nThe comprehensive health program which I recommended on November 19, 1945,\r\nwill require substantial additions to the Social Security System and, in\r\nconjunction with other changes that need to be made, will require further\r\nconsideration of the financial basis for social security. The system of\r\nprepaid medical care which I have recommended is expected eventually to\r\nrequire amounts equivalent to 4 percent of earnings up to $3,600 a year,\r\nwhich is about the average of present expenditures by individuals for\r\nmedical care. The pooling of medical costs, under a plan which permits each\r\nindividual to make a free choice of doctor and hospital, would assure that\r\nindividuals receive adequate treatment and hospitalization when they are\r\nfaced with emergencies for which they cannot budget individually. In\r\naddition, I recommended insurance benefits to replace part of the earnings\r\nlost through temporary sickness and permanent disability.\r\n\r\nEven without these proposed major additions, it would now be time to\r\nundertake a thorough reconsideration of our social security laws. The\r\nstructure should be expanded and liberalized. Provision should be made for\r\nextending coverage credit to veterans for the period of their service in\r\nthe armed forces. In the financial provisions we must reconcile the\r\nactuarial needs of social security, including health insurance, with the\r\nrequirements of a revenue system that is designed to promote a high level\r\nof consumption and full employment.\r\n\r\n(k) Education.\r\n\r\nAlthough the major responsibility for financing education rests with the\r\nStates, some assistance has long been given by the Federal Government.\r\nFurther assistance is desirable and essential. There are many areas and\r\nsome whole States where good schools cannot be provided without imposing an\r\nundue local tax burden on the citizens. It is essential to provide adequate\r\nelementary and secondary schools everywhere, and additional educational\r\nopportunities for large numbers of people beyond the secondary level.\r\nAccordingly, I repeat the proposal of last year's Budget Message that the\r\nFederal Government provide financial aid to assist the States in assuring\r\nmore nearly equal opportunities for a good education. The proposed Federal\r\ngrants for current educational expenditures should be made for the purpose\r\nof improving the educational system where improvement is most needed. They\r\nshould not be used to replace existing non-Federal expenditures, or even to\r\nrestore merely the situation which existed before the war.\r\n\r\nIn the future we expect incomes considerably higher than before the war.\r\nHigher incomes should make it possible for State and local governments and\r\nfor individuals to support higher and more nearly adequate expenditures for\r\neducation. But inequality among the States will still remain, and Federal\r\nhelp will still be needed.\r\n\r\nAs a part of our total public works program, consideration should be given\r\nto the need for providing adequate buildings for schools and other\r\neducational institutions. In view of current arrears in the construction of\r\neducational facilities, I believe that legislation to authorize grants for\r\neducational facilities, to be matched by similar expenditures by State and\r\nlocal authorities, should receive the favorable consideration of the\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Government has not sought, and will not seek, to dominate\r\neducation in the States. It should continue its historic role of leadership\r\nand advice and, for the purpose of equalizing educational opportunity, it\r\nshould extend further financial support to the cause of education in areas\r\nwhere this is desirable.\r\n\r\n(l) Federal Government personnel.\r\n\r\nThe rapid reconversion of the Federal Government from war to peace is\r\nreflected in the demobilization of its civilian personnel. The number of\r\nthese employees in continental United States has been reduced by more than\r\n500,000 from the total of approximately 2,900,000 employed in the final\r\nmonths of the war. I expect that by next June we shall have made a further\r\nreduction of equal magnitude and that there will be continuing reductions\r\nduring the next fiscal year. Of the special wartime agencies now remaining,\r\nonly a few are expected to continue actively into the next fiscal year.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that we have curtailed the number of employees, we have\r\nshortened the workweek by one-sixth or more throughout the Government and\r\nhave restored holidays. The process of readjustment has been complicated\r\nand costs have been increased by a heavy turn-over in the remaining\r\npersonnel--particularly by the loss of some of our best administrators.\r\nThousands of war veterans have been reinstated or newly employed in the\r\ncivil service. Many civilians have been transferred from war agencies to\r\ntheir former peacetime agencies. Recruitment standards, which had to be\r\nrelaxed during the war, are now being tightened.\r\n\r\nThe elimination last autumn of overtime work for nearly all Federal\r\nemployees meant a sharp cut in their incomes. For salaried workers, the\r\nblow was softened but by no means offset by the increased rates of pay\r\nwhich had become effective July 1. Further adjustments to compensate for\r\nincreased living costs are required. Moreover, we have long needed a\r\ngeneral upward revision of Federal Government salary scales at all levels\r\nin all branches--legislative, judicial, and executive. Too many in\r\nGovernment have had to sacrifice too much in economic advantage to serve\r\nthe Nation.\r\n\r\nAdequate salaries will result in economies and improved efficiency in the\r\nconduct of Government business--gains that will far outweigh the immediate\r\ncosts. I hope the Congress will expedite action on salary legislation for\r\nall Federal employees in all branches of the Government. The only exception\r\nI would make is in the case of workers whose pay rates are established by\r\nwage boards; a blanket adjustment would destroy the system by which their\r\nwages are kept aligned with prevailing rates in particular localities. The\r\nwage boards should be sensitive now, as they were during the war, to\r\nchanges in local prevailing wage rates and should make adjustments\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nI hope also that the Congress may see fit to enact legislation for the\r\nadequate protection of the health and safety of Federal employees, for\r\ntheir coverage under a system of unemployment compensation, and for their\r\nreturn at Government expense to their homes after separation from wartime\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n(m) Territories, insular possessions, and the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nThe major governments of the world face few problems as important and as\r\nperplexing as those relating to dependent peoples. This Government is\r\ncommitted to the democratic principle that it is for the dependent peoples\r\nthemselves to decide what their status shall be. To this end I asked the\r\nCongress last October to provide a means by which the people of Puerto Rico\r\nmight choose their form of government and ultimate status with respect to\r\nthe United States. I urge, too, that the Congress promptly accede to the\r\nwishes of the people of Hawaii that the Territory be admitted to statehood\r\nin our Union, and that similar action be taken with respect to Alaska as\r\nsoon as it is certain that this is the desire of the people of that great\r\nTerritory. The people of the Virgin Islands should be given an increasing\r\nmeasure of self-government.\r\n\r\nWe have already determined that the Philippine Islands are to be\r\nindependent on July 4, 1946. The ravages of war and enemy occupation,\r\nhowever, have placed a heavy responsibility upon the United States. I urge\r\nthat the Congress complete, as promptly and as generously as may be\r\npossible, legislation which will aid economic rehabilitation for the\r\nPhilippines. This will be not only a just acknowledgment of the loyalty of\r\nthe people of the Philippines, but it will help to avoid the economic chaos\r\nwhich otherwise will be their heritage from our common war. Perhaps no\r\nevent in the long centuries of colonialism gives more hope for the pattern\r\nof the future than the independence of the Philippines.\r\n\r\nThe District of Columbia, because of its special relation to the Federal\r\nGovernment, has been treated since 1800 as a dependent area. We should move\r\ntoward a greater measure of local self-government consistent with the\r\nconstitutional status of the District. We should take adequate steps to\r\nassure that citizens of the United States are not denied their franchise\r\nmerely because they reside at the Nation's Capital.\r\n\r\nIII. THE BUDGET FOR THE FEDERAL PROGRAM\r\n\r\nFOR THE FISCAL YEAR 1947\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF THE BUDGET\r\n\r\nFor the first time since the fiscal year 1930 the Budget for the next\r\nfiscal year will require no increase in the national debt.\r\n\r\nExpenditures of all kinds, authorized and recommended, in the next year are\r\nestimated at just above 35.8 billion dollars. Net receipts are estimated at\r\n31.5 billion dollars. The estimated difference of 4.3 billion dollars will\r\nbe met by a reduction in the very substantial balance which will be in the\r\nTreasury during the next fiscal year.\r\n\r\nA large part of the activities outside defense and war liquidation,\r\naftermath of war, and international finance, classified as \"other\r\nactivities\" in a following table, is still due to repercussions of the war.\r\nThese \"other activities\" include more than 2 billion dollars for aids to\r\nagriculture and net outlays for the Commodity Credit Corporation-almost\r\ndouble the expenditures for the same purposes in prewar years. This\r\nincrease is due mainly to expenditures for purposes of price stabilization\r\nand price support resulting from the war food production program. Other\r\nincreases in this category are due to the fact that certain wartime\r\nagencies now in the process of liquidation are included in this group of\r\nactivities. If all expenditures for those activities which are directly or\r\nindirectly related to the war are excluded, the residual expenditures are\r\nbelow those for corresponding activities in prewar years. In making this\r\ncomparison account should be taken of the fact that, while prewar\r\nexpenditures were affected by direct relief and work relief for the\r\nunemployed, the postwar budgets are affected by the considerable increase\r\nin pay rates and other increases in costs and prices.\r\n\r\nTo elaborate, the Budget, as I have remarked above, reflects on both sides\r\nof the ledger the Government's program as recommended by the Executive. It\r\nincludes estimates not only of expenditures and receipts for which\r\nlegislative authority already exists, but also of expenditures and receipts\r\nfor which authorization is recommended.\r\n\r\nThe Budget total for the next fiscal year, the year that ends on June 30,\r\n1947, is estimated at just above 35.8 billion dollars-about a third of the\r\nbudgets for global war, although nearly four times the prewar budgets. This\r\nestimate is based on the assumption that a rapid liquidation of the war\r\nprogram will be associated with rapid reconversion and expansion of\r\npeacetime production. The total includes net outlays of Government\r\ncorporations.\r\n\r\nThe estimated expenditures in the next and current fiscal year compare as\r\nfollows with those of a year of global war and a prewar year:\r\n\r\nTotal Budget expenditures\r\n\r\nFiscal year: (in millions)\r\n\r\n1947 $35, 860\r\n\r\n1946 67,229\r\n\r\n1945 100, 031\r\n\r\n1940 9,252\r\n\r\nAlthough allowances for occupation, demobilization, and defense are\r\ndrastically reduced in the fiscal year 1947, they will still amount to 42\r\npercent of the total Budget. The so-called \"aftermath of war\" expenditures\r\naccount for a further 30 percent of the total. The total of all other\r\nprograms, which was drastically cut during the war, is increasing again as\r\nliquidation of the war program proceeds and renewed emphasis is placed on\r\nthe peacetime objectives of the Government.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the ledger, net receipts are estimated at 31.5 billion\r\ndollars. This estimate assumes that all existing taxes will continue all\r\nthrough the fiscal year 1947. Included are the extraordinary receipts from\r\nthe disposal of surplus property.\r\n\r\nAs a result, estimated expenditures will exceed estimated receipts by 4.3\r\nbillion dollars. This amount can be provided by a reduction in the cash\r\nbalance in the Treasury. Thus, after a long period of increasing public\r\ndebt resulting from depression budgets and war budgets, it is anticipated\r\nthat no increase in the Federal debt will be required next year.\r\n\r\nFEDERAL BUDGET EXPENDITURES AND BUDGET RECEIPTS\r\n\r\nIncluding net outlays of Government corporations and credit agencies (based\r\non existing and proposed legislation)\r\n\r\nFiscal year\r\n\r\nExpenditures: 1946 1947\r\n\r\nDefense, war, and war liquidation $49,000 $15,000\r\n\r\nAftermath of war: Veterans, interest, refunds 10,813 10,793\r\n\r\nInternational finance (including proposed legislation) 2,614 2,754\r\n\r\nOther activities 4,552 5,813\r\n\r\nActivities based on proposed legislation\r\n\r\n(excluding international finance) 2501,500\r\n\r\nTotal expenditures 67, 229 35, 860\r\n\r\nReceipts (net) 38, 60931,513\r\n\r\nExcess of expenditures 28,620 4,347\r\n\r\nThe current fiscal year, 1946, is a year of transition. When the year\r\nopened, in July 1945, we were still fighting a major war, and Federal\r\nexpenditures were running at an annual rate of about 100 billion dollars.\r\nBy June 1946 that rate will be more than cut in half. The Budget total for\r\nthe current fiscal year is now estimated at 67.2 billion dollars, of which\r\nmore than two-thirds provides for war and war liquidation. Since net\r\nreceipts are estimated at 38.6 billion dollars, there will be an excess of\r\nexpenditures of 28.6 billion dollars for the current fiscal year.\r\n\r\nFor all programs discussed in this Message I estimate the total of Budget\r\nappropriations and authorizations (including reappropriations and permanent\r\nappropriations) at 30,982 million dollars for the fiscal year 1947. Of this\r\namount, present permanent appropriations are expected to provide 5,755\r\nmillion dollars, principally for interest. This leaves 24,224 million\r\ndollars to be made available through new appropriations, exclusive of\r\nappropriations to liquidate contract authorizations; 900 million dollars in\r\nnew contract authorizations; and 103 million dollars through the\r\nreappropriation of unliquidated balances of previous appropriations. The\r\nappropriations needed to liquidate contract authorizations are estimated at\r\n1,113 million dollars.\r\n\r\nIn the Budget for the year ahead only over-all estimates are included at\r\nthis time for the major war agencies and for net outlays of Government\r\ncorporations. Detailed recommendations will be transmitted in the spring\r\nfor the war agencies; and the business-type budgets of Government\r\ncorporations will likewise be transmitted in accordance with the recently\r\nadopted Government Corporation Control Act.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, only over-all estimates are provided for new programs\r\nrecommended in this Message; detailed recommendations will be transmitted\r\nafter authorizing legislation has been enacted. It should be recognized\r\nthat many of the estimates for new programs recommended in this Message are\r\ninitial year figures. These figures will be affected by the date the\r\nlegislation is enacted and by the time needed for getting a program under\r\nway. New programs, such as that for a national research agency, will\r\nrequire larger amounts in later years. The estimates exclude major elements\r\nof the proposed national health program since the greater part of these\r\nwill be covered by expenditures from trust funds.\r\n\r\nThe Budget total includes expenditures for capital outlay as well as for\r\ncurrent operations. An estimated 1,740 million dollars will be expended in\r\nthe fiscal year 1947 for direct Federal public works and for loans and\r\ngrants for public works.\r\n\r\nTHE ECONOMIC IMPACT Of THE LIQUIDATION\r\n\r\nOF THE WAR PROGRAM\r\n\r\nGovernment programs are of such importance in the development of production\r\nand employment opportunities--domestic and international--that it has\r\nbecome essential to formulate and consider the Federal Budget in the light\r\nof the Nation's budget as a whole. The relationship between the receipts,\r\nexpenditures, and savings of consumers, business, and government is shown\r\nin the accompanying table.\r\n\r\nConsidering the whole Nation, total expenditures must equal the total\r\nreceipts, because what any individual or group spends becomes receipts of\r\nother individuals or groups. Such equality can be achieved on either a high\r\nlevel of incomes or on a low or depression level of incomes.\r\n\r\nTremendous orders for munitions during the war shifted production and\r\nemployment into high gear. Total goods produced and services rendered for\r\nprivate as well as for Government purposes--the Nation's budget-reached\r\nabout 200 billion dollars in the calendar year 1944. Federal, State, and\r\nlocal government expenditures represented half of this total.\r\n\r\nCorresponding estimates for the past 3 months depict the national economy\r\nin the process of demobilization and reconversion.\r\n\r\nThe wartime annual rate of Federal expenditures has been reduced by 32\r\nbillion dollars, while the Nation's budget total has dropped only half as\r\nmuch. The drop in total value of production and services has been less\r\ndrastic because increasing private activities have absorbed in large\r\nmeasure the manpower and materials released from war production and war\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nThe largest increase in private activities has occurred in business\r\ninvestments, which include residential and other construction, producers'\r\ndurable equipment, accumulation of inventories, and net exports. Under\r\nconditions of global war, expenditures for private construction and\r\nequipment were held to a minimum and inventories were depleted. With the\r\nbeginning of reconversion these developments have been reversed.\r\nResidential construction and outlays for plant and equipment are on the\r\nincrease; inventories, too, are being replenished. International\r\ntransactions (excluding lend-lease and international relief which are\r\nincluded under war expenditures) showed an import surplus under conditions\r\nof global war. In the past 3 months private exports have been slightly in\r\nexcess of imports, for the first time since 1941.\r\n\r\nConsumers' budgets show a significant change. On the income side, their\r\ntotal has declined but little because the reduction in \"take-home\" pay of\r\nwar workers is, to a large extent, offset for the time being by the\r\nmustering-out payments received by war veterans and by unemployment\r\ncompensation received by the unemployed. On the expenditure side, however,\r\nconsumers' budgets, restricted during the war, have in creased\r\nsubstantially as a result of the fact that scarce goods are beginning to\r\nappear on the market and wartime restraints are disappearing. Thus,\r\nconsumers' current savings are declining substantially from the\r\nextraordinarily high wartime rate and some wartime savings are beginning to\r\nbe used for long-delayed purchases.\r\n\r\nTHE GOVERNMENT'S BUDGET AND THE NATION'S BUDGET\r\n\r\nCalendar year 1944 and October-December 1945\r\n\r\nOct.-Dec. 1945 (start of\r\n\r\nreconversion) (in seasonally\r\n\r\nCalendar Year 1944 (global war) adjusted annual rates)\r\n\r\n______________________ ____________________\r\n\r\nExcess Excess\r\n\r\nExpendi- (+), def- Expendi- (+),def-\r\n\r\nEconomic Group Receipts tures icit(-) Receipts tures icit(-) CONSUMERS\r\n\r\nIncome after taxes $134 ....... ...... $132 ...... .......\r\n\r\nExpenditures ......$98............$107 .......\r\n\r\nExcess of receipts, savings (+) ...... ...... +$35 ...... ...... +$25\r\nBUSINESS\r\n\r\nUndistributed profits and reserves $13 ...... ...... $9 ...... ......\r\n\r\nGross capital formation:\r\n\r\nDomestic ...... $4 ...... ...... $15 ......\r\n\r\nNet exports1 ......--2............1......\r\n\r\nTotal, gross capital formation ......2............16......\r\n\r\nExcess of receipts (+) or capital\r\n\r\nformation (--) ...... ...... +$11 ...... ...... --$7\r\n\r\nSTATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nReceipts from the public, other\r\n\r\nthan borrowing $10 ...... ...... $11 ...... ......\r\n\r\nPayments to the public ...... $8............$9......\r\n\r\nExcess of receipts (+) ............+$2............+$2\r\n\r\nFEDERAL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nReceipts from the public, other\r\n\r\nthan borrowing $48 ...... ....... $44 ...... ......\r\n\r\nPayments to the public ......$96 .............$64......\r\n\r\nExcess of payments (--) ............--$48............. --$20\r\n\r\nLess: Adjustments2 $7 $7 ....... $14 $14 .......\r\n\r\nTOTAL: GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT\r\n\r\nReceipts $198 ....... ...... $182 ...... ......\r\n\r\nExpenditures ......$198............ $182......\r\n\r\nBalance ...... ...... 0 ...... ...... ......\r\n\r\n1 Excludes exports for lend-lease and relief which are included in Federal\r\nGovernment expenditures.\r\n\r\n2 Mainly government expenditures for other than goods and services, such as\r\nmustering-out pay and unemployment compensation.\r\n\r\nUnemployment has increased less than was expected during this first period\r\nof demobilization and reconversion. It is true that 6 million men and women\r\nhave been discharged from the armed forces since May 1945 and more than 5\r\nmillion have been laid off from war work. On the other hand, more than a\r\nmillion civilians have been enlisted in the armed forces, a considerable\r\nnumber of war veterans have not immediately sought jobs, and many war\r\nworkers, especially women, have withdrawn from the labor force. In\r\naddition, many industries, and especially service trades which were\r\nundermanned during the war, are beginning now, for the first time in years,\r\nto recruit an adequate labor force. The reduced workweek has also\r\ncontributed to the absorption of those released from war service and war\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nIn general, the drastic cut in war programs has thrown the economy into\r\nlower gear; it has not thrown it out of gear. Our economic machine\r\ndemonstrates remarkable resiliency, although there are many difficulties\r\nthat must still be overcome. The rapid termination of war contracts, prompt\r\nclearance of unneeded Government-owned equipment from private plants, and\r\nother reconversion policies have greatly speeded up the beginning of\r\npeacetime work in reconverted plants.\r\n\r\nAlthough the first great shock of demobilization and war-work termination\r\nhas thus been met better than many observers expected, specific industries\r\nand specific regions show much unevenness in the progress of reconversion.\r\n\r\nThe Quarterly Report of the Director of War Mobilization and Reconversion\r\nanalyzes the difficulties in recruiting personnel and obtaining materials\r\nthat hamper reconversion in certain industries and proposes policies to\r\ndeal with these situations. The lack of adequate housing is one of the main\r\nfactors checking the flow of workers into areas where job opportunities\r\nexist.\r\n\r\nFEDERAL REVENUE, BORROWING, AND THE\r\n\r\nPUBLIC DEBT\r\n\r\nI. FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS AND TAX POLICY\r\n\r\nRecommendations for tax legislation should be considered not only in the\r\nlight of the financial requirements of the ensuing year, but also in the\r\nlight of future years' financial requirements and a full consideration of\r\neconomic conditions.\r\n\r\nExpenditures are estimated at nearly 36 billion dollars in the fiscal year\r\n1947; they can hardly be expected to be reduced to less than 25 billion\r\ndollars in subsequent years. Net receipts in the fiscal year 1947 are\r\nestimated at 31.5 billion dollars.\r\n\r\nIncluded in this estimate are 2 billion dollars of receipts from disposal\r\nand rental of surplus property and 190 million dollars of receipts from\r\nrenegotiation of wartime contracts. These sources of receipts will\r\ndisappear in future years. Tax collections for the fiscal year 1947 also\r\nwill not yet fully reflect the reduction in corporate tax liabilities\r\nprovided in the Revenue Act of 1945. If the extraordinary receipts from the\r\ndisposal of surplus property and renegotiation of contracts be disregarded,\r\nand if the tax reductions adopted in the Revenue Act of 1945 were fully\r\neffective, present tax rates would yield about 27 billion dollars.\r\n\r\nThese estimates for the fiscal year 1947 are based on the assumption of\r\ngenerally favorable business conditions but not on an income reflecting\r\nfull employment and the high productivity that we hope to achieve. In\r\nfuture years the present tax system, in conjunction with a full employment\r\nlevel of national income, could be expected to yield more than 30 billion\r\ndollars, which is substantially above the anticipated peacetime level of\r\nexpenditures.\r\n\r\nIn view of the still extraordinarily large expenditures in the coming year\r\nand continuing inflationary pressures, I am making no recommendation for\r\ntax reduction at this time.\r\n\r\nWe have already had a substantial reduction in taxes from wartime peaks.\r\nThe Revenue Act of 1945 was a major tax-reduction measure. It decreased the\r\ntotal tax load by more than one-sixth, an amount substantially in excess of\r\nthe reductions proposed by the Secretary of the Treasury to congressional\r\ntax committees in October 1945. These proposed reductions were designed to\r\nencourage reconversion and peacetime business expansion.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of further tax reductions must depend on the budgetary\r\nsituation and the economic situation. The level of anticipated expenditures\r\nfor the fiscal year 1947 and the volume of outstanding public debt require\r\nthe maintenance of large revenues.\r\n\r\nMoreover, inflationary pressures still appear dangerously powerful, and\r\nill-advised tax reduction would operate to strengthen them still further.\r\n\r\nMy decision not to recommend additional tax reductions at this time is made\r\nin the light of existing economic conditions and prospects.\r\n\r\n2. BORROWING AND THE PUBLIC DEBT\r\n\r\nThe successful conclusion of the Victory loan marked the end of war\r\nborrowing and the beginning of the transition to postwar debt management.\r\n\r\nBecause of the success of the Victory loan, I am happy to report that the\r\nTreasury will not need to borrow any new money from the public during the\r\nremainder of the present fiscal year except through regular sales of\r\nsavings bonds and savings notes. Furthermore, a part of the large cash\r\nbalance now in the Treasury will be used for debt redemption so that the\r\npublic debt which now amounts to about 278 billion dollars will decrease by\r\nseveral billion dollars during the next 18 months. The present statutory\r\ndebt limit of 300 billion dollars will provide an ample margin for all of\r\nthe public-debt transactions through the fiscal year 1947. The net effect\r\nof the excess of expenditures and debt redemption on the Treasury cash\r\nbalance, as compared with selected previous years, is shown in the\r\nfollowing table:\r\n\r\nEXCESS Of BUDGET EXPENDITURES, THE PUBLIC DEBT, AND THE TREASURY CASH\r\nBALANCE IN SELECTED YEARS\r\n\r\nExcess of At end of period\r\n\r\nBudget ex- _____________________\r\n\r\npenditures Public Cash bal-\r\n\r\nFiscal Year over receipts debt ance\r\n\r\n1940 $3. 9 $43. 0 $1. 9\r\n\r\n1945 53. 6 258. 7 24. 7 1946:\r\n\r\nJuly-Dec. 1945 18. 1 278. 1 26. 0\r\n\r\nJan.-June 1946 10. 5 275. 0 11. 9\r\n\r\n1947 4. 3 271. 0 3. 2\r\n\r\nAlthough the public debt is expected to decline, a substantial volume of\r\nrefinancing will be required, because of the large volume of maturing\r\nobligations. Redemptions of savings bonds also have been running high in\r\nrecent months and are expected to remain large for some time. The issuance\r\nof savings bonds will be continued. These bonds represent a convenient\r\nmethod of investment for small savers, and also an anti-inflationary method\r\nof refinancing. Government agencies and trust funds are expected to buy\r\nabout 2.5 billion dollars of Government securities during the next 6\r\nmonths, and 2.8 billion dollars more during the fiscal year 1947. Through\r\nthese and other debt operations, the distribution of the Federal debt among\r\nthe various types of public and private owners will change, even though the\r\ntotal is expected to decline.\r\n\r\nThe interest policies followed in the refinancing operations will have a\r\nmajor impact not only on the provision for interest payments in future\r\nbudgets, but also on the level of interest rates prevailing in private\r\nfinancing. The average rate of interest on the debt is now a little under 2\r\npercent. Low interest rates will be an important force in promoting the\r\nfull production and full employment in the postwar period for which we are\r\nall striving. Close wartime cooperation between the Treasury Department and\r\nthe Federal Reserve System has made it possible to finance the most\r\nexpensive war in history at low and stable rates of interest. This\r\ncooperation will continue.\r\n\r\nNo less important than the level of interest rates paid on the debt is the\r\ndistribution of its ownership. Of the total debt, more than half represents\r\ndirect savings of individuals or investments of funds received from\r\nindividual savings by life insurance companies, mutual savings banks,\r\nsavings and loan associations, private or Government trust funds, and other\r\nagencies.\r\n\r\nMost of the remaining debt--more than 100 billion dollars--is held by the\r\ncommercial banks and the Federal Reserve banks. Heavy purchases by the\r\nbanks were necessary to provide adequate funds to finance war expenditures.\r\nA considerable portion of these obligations are short-term in character and\r\nhence will require refinancing in the coming months and years. Since they\r\nhave been purchased out of newly created bank funds, continuance of the\r\npresent low rates of interest is entirely appropriate. To do otherwise\r\nwould merely increase bank profits at the expense of the taxpayer.\r\n\r\nThe 275-billion dollar debt poses a problem that requires careful\r\nconsideration in the determination of financial and economic policies. We\r\nhave learned that the problem, serious as it is, can be managed. Its\r\nmanagement will require determined action to keep our Federal Budget in\r\norder and to relate our fiscal policies to the requirements of an expanding\r\neconomy. The more successful we are in achieving full production and full\r\nemployment the easier it will be to manage the debt and pay for the debt\r\nservice. Large though the debt is, it is within our economic capacity. The\r\ninterest charges on it amount to but a small proportion of our national\r\nincome. The Government is determined, by a resolute policy of economic\r\nstabilization, to protect the interests of the millions of American\r\ncitizens who have invested in its securities.\r\n\r\nDuring the past 6 months the net revenue receipts of the Federal Government\r\nhave been about 20 billion dollars, almost as much as during the closing 6\r\nmonths of 1944 when the country was still engaged in all-out warfare. The\r\nhigh level of these receipts reflects the smoothness of the reconversion\r\nand particularly the strength of consumer demand. But the receipts so far\r\ncollected, it must be remembered, do not reflect any of the tax reductions\r\nmade by the Revenue Act of 1945. These reductions will not have their full\r\neffect on the revenue collected until the fiscal year 1948.\r\n\r\nIt is good to move toward a balanced budget and a start on the retirement\r\nof the debt at a time when demand for goods is strong and the business\r\noutlook is good. These conditions prevail today. Business is good and there\r\nare still powerful forces working in the direction of inflation. This is\r\nnot the time for tax reduction.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR SPECIFIC FEDERAL ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\n1. WAR LIQUIDATION AND NATIONAL DEFENSE\r\n\r\n(a) War expenditures.\r\n\r\nThe fiscal year 1947 will see a continuance of war liquidation and\r\noccupation. During this period we shall also lay the foundation for our\r\npeacetime system of national defense.\r\n\r\nIn the fiscal year that ended on June 30, 1945, almost wholly a period of\r\nglobal warfare, war expenditures amounted to 90.5 billion dollars. For the\r\nfiscal year 1946 war expenditures were originally estimated at 70 billion\r\ndollars. That estimate was made a year ago while we were still engaged in\r\nglobal warfare. After victory over Japan this estimate was revised to 50.5\r\nbillion dollars. Further cut-backs and accelerated demobilization have made\r\npossible an additional reduction in the rate of war spending. During the\r\nfirst 6 months 32.9 billion dollars were spent. It is now estimated that\r\n16.1 billion dollars will be spent during the second 6 months, or a total\r\nof 49 billion dollars during the whole fiscal year.\r\n\r\nFor the fiscal year 1947 it is estimated, tentatively, that expenditures\r\nfor war liquidation, for occupation, and for national defense will be\r\nreduced to 15 billion dollars. The War and Navy Departments are expected to\r\nspend 13 billion dollars; expenditures of other agencies, such as the\r\nUnited States Maritime Commission, the War Shipping Administration, and the\r\nOffice of Price Administration, and payments to the United Nations Relief\r\nand Rehabilitation Administration are estimated at 3 billion dollars.\r\nAllowing for estimated net receipts of 1 billion dollars arising from war\r\nactivities of the Reconstruction finance Corporation, the estimated total\r\nof war expenditures is 15 billion dollars. At this time only a tentative\r\nbreak-down of the total estimate for war and defense activities can be\r\nindicated.\r\n\r\nAn expenditure of 15 billion dollars for war liquidation, occupation, and\r\nnational defense is a large sum for a year which begins 10 months after\r\nfighting has ended. It is 10 times our expenditures for defense before the\r\nwar; it amounts to about 10 percent of our expected national income. This\r\nestimate reflects the immense job that is involved in winding up a global\r\nwar effort and stresses the great responsibility that victory has placed\r\nupon this country. The large expenditures needed for our national defense\r\nemphasize the great scope for effective organization in furthering economy\r\nand efficiency. To this end I have recently recommended to the Congress\r\nadoption of legislation combining the War and Navy Departments into a\r\nsingle Department of National Defense.\r\n\r\nA large part of these expenditures is still to be attributed to the costs\r\nof the war. Assuming, somewhat arbitrarily, that about one-half of the\r\n15-billion-dollar outlay for the fiscal year 1947 is for war liquidation,\r\naggregate expenditures by this Government for the second World War are now\r\nestimated at 347 billion dollars through June 30, 1947. Of this, about 9\r\nbillion dollars will have been recovered through renegotiation and sale of\r\nsurplus property by June 30, 1947; this has been reflected in the estimates\r\nof receipts.\r\n\r\nDemobilization and strength of armed forces.--Demobilization of our armed\r\nforces is proceeding rapidly. At the time of victory in Europe, about 12.3\r\nmillion men and women were in the armed forces; 7.6 million were overseas.\r\nBy the end of December 1945 our armed forces had been reduced to below 7\r\nmillion. By June 30, 1946, they will number about 2.9 million, of whom 1.8\r\nmillion will be individuals enlisted and inducted after VE-day.\r\nMustering-out pay is a large item of our war liquidation expense; it will\r\ntotal 2.5 billion dollars in the fiscal year 1946, and about 500 million\r\ndollars in the fiscal year 1947.\r\n\r\nIn the fiscal year 1947 the strength of our armed forces will still be\r\nabove the ultimate peacetime level. As I have said, War and Navy Department\r\nrequirements indicate a strength of about 2 million in the armed forces a\r\nyear from now. This is necessary to enable us to do our share in the\r\noccupation of enemy territories and in the preservation of peace in a\r\ntroubled world. Expenditures for pay, subsistence, travel, and\r\nmiscellaneous expenses of the armed forces, excluding mustering-out pay,\r\nare estimated at 5 billion dollars.\r\n\r\nContract settlement and surplus property disposal.--The winding up of war\r\nprocurement is the second most important liquidation job. By the end of\r\nNovember a total of 301,000 prime contracts involving commitments of 64\r\nbillion dollars had been terminated. Of this total, 67,000 contracts with\r\ncommitments of 35 billion dollars remained to be settled. Termination\r\npayments on these contracts are estimated at about 3.5 billion dollars. It\r\nis expected that more than half of these terminated contracts will be\r\nsettled during the current fiscal year, leaving payments of about 1.5\r\nbillion dollars for the fiscal year 1947.\r\n\r\nAnother important aspect of war supply liquidation is the disposal of\r\nsurplus property. Munitions, ships, plants, installations, and supplies,\r\noriginally costing 50 billion dollars or more, will ultimately be declared\r\nsurplus. The sale value of this property will be far less than original\r\ncost and disposal expenses are estimated at 10 to 15 cents on each dollar\r\nrealized. Disposal units within existing agencies have been organized to\r\nliquidate surplus property under the direction of the Surplus Property\r\nAdministration. Overseas disposal activities have been centralized in the\r\nState Department to permit this program to be carried on in line with\r\nover-all foreign policy. Thus far only about 13 billion dollars of the\r\nultimate surplus, including 5 billion dollars of unsalable aircraft, has\r\nbeen declared. Of this amount, 2.3 billion dollars have been disposed of,\r\nin sales yielding 600 million dollars. The tremendous job of handling\r\nsurplus stocks will continue to affect Federal expenditures and receipts\r\nfor several years. The speed and effectiveness of surplus disposal\r\noperations will be of great importance for the domestic economy as well as\r\nfor foreign economic policies.\r\n\r\nWar supplies, maintenance, and relief.-Adequate provision for the national\r\ndefense requires that we keep abreast of scientific and technical advances.\r\nThe tentative estimates for the fiscal year 1947 make allowance for\r\nmilitary research, limited procurement of weapons in the developmental\r\nstate, and some regular procurement of munitions which were developed but\r\nnot mass-produced when the war ended. Expenditures for procurement and\r\nconstruction will constitute one-third or less of total defense outlays,\r\ncompared to a ratio of two-thirds during the war years.\r\n\r\nThe estimates also provide for the maintenance of our war-expanded naval\r\nand merchant fleets, military installations, and stocks of military\r\nequipment and supplies. Our naval combatant fleet is three times its\r\npre-Pearl Harbor tonnage. Our Merchant Marine is five times its prewar\r\nsize. The War Department has billions of dollars worth of equipment and\r\nsupplies. Considerable maintenance and repair expense is necessary for the\r\nequipment which we desire to retain in active status or in war reserve.\r\nExpenses will be incurred for winnowing the stocks of surpluses, for\r\npreparing lay-up facilities for the reserve fleets, and for storage of\r\nreserve equipment and supplies.\r\n\r\nMilitary expenditures .in the current fiscal year include 650 million\r\ndollars for civilian supplies for the prevention of starvation and disease\r\nin occupied areas. Expenditures on this account will continue in the fiscal\r\nyear 1947. The war expenditures also cover the expenses of civilian\r\nadministration in occupied areas.\r\n\r\nDuring the war, 15 cents of each dollar of our war expenditures was for\r\nlend-lease aid. With lend-lease terminated, I expect the direct operations\r\nunder this program to be substantially completed in the current fiscal\r\nyear. The expenditures estimated for the fiscal year 1947 under this\r\nprogram are mainly interagency reimbursements for past transactions.\r\n\r\nRelief and rehabilitation expenditures are increasing. It is imperative\r\nthat we give all necessary aid within our means to the people who have\r\nborne the ravages of war. I estimate that in the fiscal year 1946\r\nexpenditures for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation\r\nAdministration will total 1.3 billion dollars and in the following year 1.2\r\nbillion dollars. Insofar as possible, procurement for this purpose will be\r\nfrom war surpluses.\r\n\r\n(b) Authorizations for war and national defense.\r\n\r\nDuring the war, authorizations and appropriations had to be enacted well in\r\nadvance of obligation and spending to afford ample time for planning of\r\nproduction by the procurement services and by industry. Thus our cumulative\r\nwar program authorized in the period between July 1, 1940, and July 1,\r\n1945, was 431 billion dollars, including net war commitments of Government\r\ncorporations. Expenditures against those authorizations totaled 290 billion\r\ndollars. This left 141 billion dollars in unobligated authorizations and\r\nunliquidated obligations.\r\n\r\nWith the end of fighting, it became necessary to adjust war authorizations\r\nto the requirements of war liquidation and continuing national defense.\r\nIntensive review of the war authorizations by both the executive and the\r\nlegislative branches has been continued since VJ-day. As a result, the\r\nauthorized war program is being brought more nearly into line with\r\nexpenditures.\r\n\r\nRecisions and authorizations through the fiscal year 1946.--Readjusting the\r\nwar program, as the Congress well knows, is not an easy task.\r\nAuthorizations must not be too tight, lest we hamper necessary operations;\r\nthey must not be too ample, lest we lose control of spending. Last\r\nSeptember, I transmitted to the Congress recommendations on the basis of\r\nwhich the Congress voted H.R. 4407 to repeal 50.3 billion dollars of\r\nappropriations and authorizations. I found it necessary to veto this bill\r\nbecause it was used as a vehicle for legislation that would impair the\r\nreemployment program. However, in order to preserve the fine work of the\r\nCongress on the recisions, I asked the Director of the Bureau of the Budget\r\nto place the exact amounts indicated for repeal in a nonexpendable reserve,\r\nand to advise the departments and agencies accordingly. This has been\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nIn accord with Public Law 132 of the Seventy-ninth Congress, I have\r\ntransmitted recommendations for additional rescissions for the current\r\nfiscal year of appropriations amounting to 5.8 billion dollars and of\r\ncontract authorizations totaling 420 million dollars. The net reduction in\r\nauthority to obligate will be 5.0 billion dollars, because, of the\r\nappropriations, 1.2 billion dollars will have to be restored in subsequent\r\nyears to liquidate contract authorizations still on the books.\r\n\r\nThe appropriations recommended for repeal include 2,827 million dollars for\r\nthe Navy Department, 1,421 million dollars for the War Department, 850\r\nmillion dollars for lend-lease, 384 million dollars for the War Shipping\r\nAdministration, and 260 million dollars for the United States Maritime\r\nCommission. The contract authorizations proposed for repeal are for the\r\nMaritime Commission.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there are unused tonnage authorizations for construction of\r\nnaval vessels now valued at 5.4 billion dollars. In September 1945, I\r\nsuggested that this authority be reviewed by the appropriate committees of\r\nthe Congress, and the Congress has moved to bar construction under these\r\nauthorizations during the remainder of the fiscal year 1946. I propose to\r\ncontinue this prohibition in the Navy budget estimates for the fiscal year\r\n1947 and now renew my recommendation that legislation be enacted at the\r\nearliest time to dear the statute books of these authorizations.\r\n\r\nThe amounts indicated for repeal in H.R. 4407 and the further rescissions\r\nwhich I have recommended, excluding duplications and deferred cash payments\r\non existing authorizations, represent a cut in the authorized war program\r\nof 60.8 billion dollars. The war authorizations will also be reduced 3'7\r\nbillion dollars by carrying receipts of revolving accounts to surplus, by\r\nlapses, and by cancellation and repayment of commitments of the Government\r\nwar corporations.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, supplemental appropriations of 600 million dollars will\r\nbe required for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation\r\nAdministration.\r\n\r\nIn the net, it is estimated that the cumulative authorized war and national\r\ndefense program will amount to 368 billion dollars on June 30, 1946.\r\nExpenditures of 49 billion dollars during the fiscal year 1946 will have\r\npushed cumulative expenditures to 339 billion dollars. The unexpended\r\nbalances will be down to 28 billion dollars on June 30, 1946.\r\n\r\nNew authorizations for national defense and war liquidation in the fiscal\r\nyear 1947.-The expenditures of 15 billion dollars for national defense and\r\nwar liquidation in the fiscal year 1947 will be partly for payment of\r\ncontractual obligations incurred in the past, and partly for the payment of\r\nnew obligations. The unexpended balances on June 30, 1946, will be\r\nscattered among hundreds of separate appropriations. Thus, while some\r\nappropriation accounts will have unused balances, others will require\r\nadditional appropriations.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that authorizations to incur new obligations of 11,772\r\nmillion dollars will be needed during the fiscal year 1947, mainly for the\r\nWar and Navy Departments. Of the required authorizations, 11,365 million\r\ndollars will be in new appropriations, 400 million dollars in new contract\r\nauthority, and 7 million dollars in reappropriations of unobligated\r\nbalances. In addition, appropriations of 825 million dollars will be needed\r\nto liquidate obligations under existing contract authorizations.\r\n\r\nTaking into account the tentative authorizations and expenditures estimated\r\nfor the fiscal year 1947, and offsets of 3 billion dollars in war\r\ncommitments of Government corporations, the cumulative authorized war and\r\nnational defense program on June 30, 1947, will be 376 billion dollars;\r\ntotal expenditures, 354 billion dollars; and unexpended balances, 22\r\nbillion dollars.\r\n\r\nThe 22 billion dollars of unexpended balances tentatively indicated as of\r\nJune 30, 1947, comprise both unobligated authorizations and unliquidated\r\nobligations. Most of the unliquidated obligations result from transactions\r\nbooked during the war years. A large part of the 22 billion dollars would\r\nnever be spent even if not repealed, for the appropriations will lapse in\r\ndue course. For example, several billion dollars of these unliquidated\r\nobligations represent unsettled inter- and intra-departmental agency\r\naccounts for war procurement. Legislation is being requested to facilitate\r\nthe adjustment of some of these inter-agency accounts. Another 6 billion\r\ndollars is set aside for contract termination payments. If contract\r\nsettlement costs continue in line with recent experience, it is likely that\r\npart of the 6 billion dollars will remain unspent.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some of the 22 billion dollars would be available for\r\nobligation and expenditure unless impounded. In certain appropriations,\r\nsuch as those for long-cycle procurement, considerable carry-over of\r\nunliquidated obligations into future years is to be expected and is\r\nnecessary. However, substantial further rescissions can and should be made\r\nwhen the war liquidation program tapers off and budgetary requirements for\r\nnational defense are clarified. As I have said, I shall continue to review\r\nthe war authorizations and from time to time recommend excess balances for\r\nrepeal.\r\n\r\nAs in recent years, detailed recommendations concerning most appropriations\r\nfor the national defense program are postponed until the spring. In\r\nconnection with the war activities of the United States Maritime Commission\r\nand certain other agencies, however, I now make specific recommendations\r\nfor the fiscal year 1947. No additional authorizations or appropriations\r\nwill be necessary for the Maritime Commission since sufficient balances\r\nwill be left after the above-mentioned rescissions to carry out the program\r\nnow contemplated for the fiscal year 1947.\r\n\r\n2. AFTERMATH OF WAR\r\n\r\nNearly one-third--11 billion dollars--of estimated Federal expenditures in\r\nthe fiscal year 1947 will be for purposes that are largely inherited from\r\nthe war--payments to veterans, interest on the Federal debt, and refunds of\r\ntaxes.\r\n\r\n(a) For veterans.\r\n\r\n\"Veterans' pensions and benefits\" has become one of the largest single\r\ncategories in the Federal Budget. I am recommending for this purpose total\r\nappropriations of 4,787 million dollars for the fiscal year 1947.\r\nExpenditures in the fiscal year are estimated, under present legislation,\r\nat 4,208 million dollars. These expenditures will help our veterans through\r\ntheir readjustment period and provide lasting care for those who were\r\ndisabled.\r\n\r\nThe Congress has provided unemployment allowances for veterans during their\r\nreadjustment period. Expenditure of 850 million dollars for this purpose is\r\nanticipated for the fiscal year 1947. In addition, readjustment allowances\r\nfor self-employed veterans are expected to cost 340 million dollars in the\r\nfiscal year 1947.\r\n\r\nOn May 28, 1945, in asking the Congress to raise the ceiling on benefits\r\nfor civilian unemployed to not less than 25 dollars a week during the\r\nimmediate reconversion period, I suggested that the Congress also consider\r\nliberalizing veterans' allowances. Elsewhere in this Message I reiterate my\r\nrecommendation with respect to emergency unemployment compensation. I also\r\nrecommend increasing veterans' unemployment allowances from 20 dollars to\r\n25 dollars a week. This would involve additional expenditures estimated at\r\napproximately 220 million dollars for the fiscal year.\r\n\r\nIncluded in the 1947 Budget is an expenditure of 535 million dollars for\r\nveterans' education under provisions of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act.\r\nThis amount includes both tuition expenses and maintenance allowances. It\r\nis expected that half a million veterans will be enrolled in our schools\r\nand colleges during the year.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate benefit which veterans receive from the loan guarantee\r\nprovisions of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act depends largely on the\r\nsuccess of our stabilization program in restraining building costs and real\r\nestate values. Under the revised procedure contained in recent amendments,\r\nthe administrative workload will be minimized by the almost complete\r\ntransfer of authority for approving the guarantees to private lending\r\nagencies and private appraisers designated by the Veterans Administration.\r\nThis authority carries with it the responsibility for restricting the\r\nguarantees to loans on reasonably valued properties. Costs of the program,\r\nother than for administration, are estimated at 21 million dollars in the\r\nfiscal year 1947.\r\n\r\nPensions for veterans will require expenditures estimated at 1,748 million\r\ndollars for the fiscal year 1947. Two-thirds of this amount will be\r\nreceived by veterans of the war which we have just won. This figure\r\nincludes 55 million dollars of increased pensions for student-veterans in\r\nour vocational rehabilitation program. In addition, 170 million dollars\r\nwill be expended in transfers to the National Service Life Insurance fund\r\nfrom general and special accounts.\r\n\r\nExpenditures under the appropriation for salaries and expenses of the\r\nVeterans Administration are estimated at 528 million dollars in the fiscal\r\nyear 1947. This includes 260 million dollars for medical care and the\r\noperation of some 103,000 hospital and domiciliary beds.\r\n\r\nA separate appropriation for hospital and domiciliary facilities,\r\nadditional to the total for veterans' pensions and benefits, covers\r\nconstruction that will provide some 13,000 hospital beds as part of the\r\n500-million dollar hospital construction program already authorized by the\r\nCongress. The estimated expenditures of 130 million dollars for this\r\npurpose are classified in the Budget as part of the general public works\r\nprogram for the next fiscal year.\r\n\r\n(b) For interest.\r\n\r\nInterest payments on the public debt are estimated at 5 billion dollars in\r\nthe fiscal year 1947, an increase of 250 million dollars from the revised\r\nestimate for the current fiscal year. This increase reflects chiefly\r\npayment of interest on additions to the debt this year. Assuming\r\ncontinuance of present interest rates, the Government's interest bill is\r\nnow reaching the probable postwar level.\r\n\r\n(c) For refunds.\r\n\r\nAn estimated total of 1,585 million dollars of refunds will be paid to\r\nindividuals and corporations during the fiscal year 1947. Slightly over\r\nhalf of this amount, or 800 million dollars, will be accessory to the\r\nsimplified pay-as-you-go method of tax collection, and will be the result\r\nof overwithholding and over declaration of expected income. Most of the\r\nremainder will arise from loss and excess-profits credit carrybacks,\r\nrecomputed amortization on war plants, and special relief from the excess\r\nprofits tax.\r\n\r\nThis category of expenditures is thus losing gradually its\r\n\"aftermath-of-war\" character, and by the succeeding year will reflect\r\nalmost entirely the normal operation of loss carry-backs and current tax\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\n3. AGRICULTURAL PROGRAMS\r\n\r\nThe agricultural programs contemplated for the fiscal year 1947 are those\r\nwhich are essential for the provision of an adequate supply of food and\r\nother agricultural commodities with a fair return to American farmers. To\r\nsupport these objectives, expenditures by the Department of Agriculture\r\nestimated at 784 million dollars from general and special accounts will be\r\nrequired in the fiscal year 1947. This compares with estimated expenditures\r\nof 676 million dollars in 1946. These figures exclude expenditures by the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture on account of lend-lease, the United Nations\r\nRelief and Rehabilitation Administration, and other war expenditures. The\r\nexpenditure for the fiscal year 1947 is composed of 553 million dollars for\r\n\"aids to agriculture,\" 35 million dollars for general public works, and 196\r\nmillion dollars for other services of the Department.\r\n\r\nNet outlays for the price stabilization, price support, and other programs\r\nof the Commodity Credit Corporation are expected to increase from about 750\r\nmillion dollars in the fiscal year 1946 to about 1,500 million dollars in\r\n1947. Cash advances made on loans by the farm Security Administration and\r\nthe Rural Electrification Administration are expected to amount to 266\r\nmillion dollars in the fiscal year 1946 and 351 million dollars in 1947;\r\nand after receipts from principal and interest are taken into account, net\r\nloan expenditures of these two agencies will amount to 120 and 209 million\r\ndollars in the two fiscal years.\r\n\r\nTo provide for the expenditures from general and special accounts, I\r\nrecommend for the fiscal year 1947 appropriations of million dollars\r\n(including the existing permanent appropriation of an amount equal to 30\r\npercent of estimated annual customs receipts) and a reappropriation of 88\r\nmillion dollars of prior-year balances from customs receipts. In addition\r\nthere is a recommended authorization of 367.5 million dollars for borrowing\r\nfrom the Reconstruction finance Corporation for the loan programs of the\r\nfarm Security Administration and the Rural Electrification Administration.\r\nIt is expected that the operations of the Commodity Credit Corporation will\r\nbe financed during the coming year through the 500 million dollars of\r\nlend-lease funds which the Congress has earmarked for price support\r\npurposes, a supplemental appropriation to restore impaired capital of the\r\nCorporation, and the borrowing authority of the Corporation.\r\n\r\nSome detailed recommendations follow for major agricultural programs.\r\n\r\nConservation and use of land.--I am recommending that 270 million dollars\r\nbe appropriated for \"conservation and use of agricultural land\r\nresources\"--the so-called AAA program--for the fiscal year 1947, compared\r\nwith 356 million dollars in the current year. This reduction of 86 million\r\ndollars is in large part accounted for by elimination of the wartime flax\r\nproduction incentive project and other nonrecurring items; the proposed\r\nreduction in normal activities is less than 33 million dollars.\r\n\r\nFor the past several years, this program has consisted largely of payments\r\nto farmers for application of fertilizer and other approved soil management\r\npractices. I am convinced that farmers generally are now fully alert to the\r\nbenefits, both immediate and long-term, which they derive from the\r\npractices encouraged by this program. I believe, therefore, that this\r\nsubsidization should continue to be reduced.\r\n\r\nRural electrification.--It is proposed that the loan authorization for the\r\nRural Electrification Administration for the fiscal year 1947 be increased\r\nfrom 200 million dollars to 250 million dollars. During the war period, REA\r\nwas limited by the scarcity of materials and manpower. But that situation\r\nis rapidly changing, and the REA program, which was materially stepped up\r\nfor the fiscal year 1946, can be increased still more. It is my belief that\r\na feasible and practical rural electrification program should be carried\r\nforward as rapidly as possible. This will involve total loans of\r\napproximately 1,800 million dollars over the next 10 years, much of which\r\nwill be repaid during that period.\r\n\r\nOther programs.--It is recommended that the continuing forest\r\nland-acquisition program be resumed at the rate of 3 million dollars\r\nannually, which is about the minimum rate at which this program can be\r\neconomically carried on. The lands involved in this program can contribute\r\nfully to the national welfare only when brought into the national forest\r\nsystem for protection and development.\r\n\r\nSuch programs as those of the farm Security Administration and the farm\r\nCredit Administration are estimated to be continued during the fiscal year\r\n1947 at about the same level as in the fiscal year 1946. Recent action by\r\nthe Congress has Permitted some expansion of the school lunch program. I\r\nhope it will be continued and expanded. The budgets of the Federal Crop\r\nInsurance Corporation and the federal farm Mortgage Corporation will be\r\ntransmitted in the spring under the terms of the Government Corporation\r\nControl Act.\r\n\r\n4. TRANSPORTATION\r\n\r\nTransportation is one of the major fields for both public and private\r\ninvestment. Our facilities for transportation and communication must be\r\nconstantly improved to serve better the convenience of the public and to\r\nfacilitate the sound growth and development of the whole economy.\r\n\r\nFederal capital outlays for transportation facilities are expected to\r\napproximate 519 million dollars in the fiscal year 1947. State and local\r\ngovernments may spend 400 million dollars. Private investment, over half of\r\nit by railways, may approach 1,150 million dollars.\r\n\r\nThe Congress has already taken steps for the resumption of work on\r\nimprovement of rivers and harbors and on the construction of new\r\nFederal-aid highways. Much needed work on airports can begin when the\r\nCongress enacts legislation now in conference between the two Houses.\r\n\r\nThe Federal expenditure estimates for the fiscal year 1947 include 53\r\nmillion dollars for new construction in rivers, harbors, and the Panama\r\nCanal and 291 million dollars for highways and grade-crossing elimination,\r\nassuming that the States expend some 275 million dollars on the Federal-aid\r\nsystem. Additional expenditures for highways totaling 36 million dollars\r\nare anticipated by the forest Service, National Park Service, and the\r\nTerritory of Alaska. Civil airways and airports will involve expenditures\r\nof 35 million dollars under existing authority. Additional Federal\r\nexpenditures exceeding 20 million dollars (to be matched by States and\r\nmunicipalities) may be made during the fiscal year 1947 under the airport\r\nlegislation now in conference between the two Houses of the Congress.\r\n\r\nThe United States now controls almost two-thirds of the world's merchant\r\nshipping, most of it Government-owned, compared with little more than\r\none-seventh of the world's tonnage in 1939. This places a heavy\r\nresponsibility upon the Nation to provide for speedy and efficient world\r\ncommerce as a contribution to general economic recovery.\r\n\r\nThe estimates for the United States Maritime Commission and War Shipping\r\nAdministration provide for the transition of shipping operation from a war\r\nto a peace basis; the sale, chartering, or lay-up of much of the war-built\r\nfleet; and for a program of ship construction of some 84 million dollars in\r\nthe fiscal year 1947 to round out the merchant fleet for peacetime use.\r\n\r\nFederal aids, subsidies, and regulatory controls for transportation should\r\nfollow the general principle of benefiting the national economy as a whole.\r\nThey should seek to improve the transportation system and increase its\r\nefficiency with resulting lower rates and superior service. Differential\r\ntreatment which benefits one type of transportation to the detriment of\r\nanother should be avoided save when it is demonstrated clearly to be in the\r\npublic interest.\r\n\r\n5. RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\nTotal capital outlays for resource development are estimated at 653 million\r\ndollars in the fiscal year 1947 as compared with 452 million dollars in\r\n1946. These include capital expenditures by the Rural Electrification\r\nAdministration and expenditures for resource development by other\r\norganizational units in the Department of Agriculture which are also\r\nmentioned above under \"agricultural programs.\"\r\n\r\nThe reclamation and flood control projects which I am recommending for the\r\nfiscal year 1947 will involve capital outlays of approximately 319 million\r\ndollars as compared with 245 million dollars in the fiscal year 1946. These\r\nexpenditures cover programs of the Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of\r\nReclamation, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Department of Agriculture,\r\nand the International Boundary and Water Commission, United States and\r\nMexico. A number of these projects are multiple-purpose projects, providing\r\nnot only for reclamation and irrigation of barren land and flood control,\r\nbut also for the production of power needed for industrial development of\r\nthe areas.\r\n\r\nExpenditures for power transmission and distribution facilities by the\r\nBonneville Power Administration are expected to increase from 12 million\r\ndollars in the fiscal year 1946 to 15 million dollars in the next fiscal\r\nyear. In addition, the Southwestern Power Administration will undertake a\r\nnew program involving expenditures of about 16 million dollars in the\r\nfiscal year 1947. The Rural Electrification Administration will require\r\nexpenditures during the current fiscal year estimated at 156 million\r\ndollars; in the fiscal year 1947, at 241 million dollars.\r\n\r\nThe TVA program includes completion of major multiple-purpose\r\nprojects--navigation, flood control, and power facilities--and additions to\r\nchemical plants and related facilities. Expenditures for these capital\r\nimprovement programs are estimated at 30 million dollars in the fiscal year\r\n1946 and 39 million dollars in the fiscal year 1947.\r\n\r\nExpenditures for construction of roads and other developmental works in the\r\nnational forests, parks, and other public lands, and for capital outlays\r\nfor fish and wildlife development will increase from below 9 million\r\ndollars in the fiscal year 1946 to 24 million dollars in the fiscal year\r\n1947.\r\n\r\n6. SOCIAL SECURITY AND HEALTH\r\n\r\nBenefit payments out of the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust fund\r\nduring 1947 are estimated at 407 million dollars, while withdrawals by the\r\nStates from the Unemployment Trust fund for compensation payments are\r\nexpected to total 1 billion dollars. These disbursements are financed out\r\nof social security contributions.\r\n\r\nThe appropriations from general and special accounts for the social\r\nsecurity program, which cover Federal administrative expenses and grants to\r\nStates for assistance programs, are estimated at 593 million dollars for\r\nthe fiscal year 1947, an increase of 57 million dollars over the current\r\nyear. The increase anticipates greater administrative workload and higher\r\ngrants to match increasing State payments. The social security program does\r\nnot include all the Federal health services under existing legislation. For\r\nthe other health services classified under general government and national\r\ndefense, appropriations are estimated at 102 million dollars for the fiscal\r\nyear 1947.\r\n\r\nSome expansion in peacetime medical research and other programs of the\r\nPublic Health Service is provided for in the appropriation estimates for\r\nthese purposes totaling approximately 87 million dollars for the fiscal\r\nyear 1947 which are submitted under provisions of existing law. Part of\r\nthis will be provided through the social security appropriations, the\r\nremainder through other appropriations. About 28 million dollars is\r\nrecommended for maternity care and health services for children under\r\nexisting law, mainly under the emergency provision for the wives and\r\ninfants of servicemen. While we should avoid duplication of maternity and\r\nchild health services which will be provided through the proposed general\r\nsystem of prepaid medical care, legislation is needed to supplement such\r\nservices. For medical education, I have recommended legislation authorizing\r\ngrants-in-aid to public and nonprofit institutions. The existing sources of\r\nsupport for medical schools require supplementation to sustain the\r\nexpansion that is needed.\r\n\r\nHospitals, sanitation works, and additional facilities at medical schools\r\nwill be required for an adequate national health program. Legislation is\r\nnow pending in the Congress to authorize grants for the construction of\r\nhospitals and health centers and grants and loans for water-pollution\r\ncontrol. I hope the Congress will act favorably on generous authorizing\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n7. RESEARCH AND EDUCATION\r\n\r\nThe Budget provides for continuation and desirable expansion of the\r\nresearch activities that are carried on throughout the Federal\r\nestablishment and through previously authorized grants to the States.\r\nAdditional appropriations will be required for the proposed central Federal\r\nresearch agency which I recommended last September 6. That agency will\r\ncoordinate existing research activities and administer funds for new\r\nresearch activities wherever they are needed; it will not itself conduct\r\nresearch. The plan contemplates expenditures through the new research\r\nagency of approximately 40 million dollars for the first year.\r\n\r\nThese amounts are small in relation to the important contribution they can\r\nmake to the national income, the welfare of our people, and the common\r\ndefense. Expenditures must be limited for the time being by the capacity of\r\nresearch agencies to make wise use of funds. The maintenance of our\r\nposition as a nation, however, will require more emphasis on research\r\nexpenditures in the future than in the past.\r\n\r\nEducational expenditures will require a significant share of the national\r\nincome in the fiscal year 1947. State, local, and private expenditures for\r\nthe current support of elementary, secondary, and higher education are\r\nexpected to be substantially above 3 billion dollars in that year. These\r\nnonfederal expenditures will be supplemented by Federal expenditures\r\nestimated at 625 million dollars in the present Budget. Of this amount, the\r\nestimate for veterans' education, as previously mentioned, is 535 million\r\ndollars. Other amounts include 21 million dollars for the support of\r\nvocational education in public schools, 5 million dollars for the\r\nland-grant colleges, 50 million dollars for the present school-lunch and\r\nmilk program, 1 million dollars for the Office of Education, and\r\napproximately 13 million dollars for various other items. In view of the\r\nmajor policy issues which are still under study by the Congress and the\r\nAdministration, no specific amount has been determined for the Federal\r\ngrants, previously recommended in this Message, which would assist the\r\nStates generally in assuring more nearly equal opportunities for a good\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the urgent need for additional school and college\r\nbuildings, careful planning will be required for the expenditures to be\r\nmade under the proposed legislation to aid the States in providing\r\neducational facilities. A major share of the grants for the first year\r\nwould be for surveys and plans.\r\n\r\nI have already outlined the broad objectives of our foreign economic\r\npolicy. In the present section I shall indicate the Federal outlays which\r\nthe execution of these programs may require in the fiscal years 1946 and\r\n1947.\r\n\r\n(a) On the termination of lend-lease, the lend-lease countries were\r\nrequired to pay for goods in the lend-lease pipe line either in cash or by\r\nborrowing from the United States or by supplying goods and services to the\r\nUnited States. Credits for this purpose have already been extended to\r\nSoviet Union, France, the Netherlands, and Belgium amounting to 675 million\r\ndollars. The settlement credit of 650 million dollars to the United Kingdom\r\nincludes an amount preliminarily fixed at 118 million dollars which\r\nrepresents the excess of purchases by the United Kingdom from the pipe line\r\nover goods and services supplied by the United Kingdom to the United States\r\nsince VJ-day and the balance of various claims by one government against\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nCredits are also being negotiated with lend-lease countries to finance the\r\ndisposition of lend-lease inventories and installations and property\r\ndeclared to be surplus. For instance, 532 million dollars of the settlement\r\ncredit to the United Kingdom is for this purpose. These credits will\r\ninvolve no new expenditures by this Government, since they merely provide\r\nfor deferred repayment by other governments for good: services which have\r\nbeen financed from war appropriations.\r\n\r\n(b) Expenditures from the appropriations to United Nations Relief and\r\nRehabilitation Administration, which were discarded under war expenditures\r\nabove, are estimated to be 1.3 billion dollars in the fiscal year 1946 and\r\n1.2 billion dollars in the fiscal year 1947.\r\n\r\n(c) To assist other countries in the restoration of their economies the\r\nExport-Import Bank has already negotiated loans in the fiscal year 1946\r\namounting in total to about 1,010 million dollars and an additional 195\r\nmillion dollars will probably be committed shortly. The Bank is also\r\ngranting loans to carry out its original purpose of directly expanding the\r\nforeign trade of the United States. In this connection the Bank has\r\nestablished a fund of 100 million dollars to finance the export of cotton\r\nfrom the United States. The Export-Import Bank has thus loaned or committed\r\napproximately 1,300 million dollars during the current fiscal year and it\r\nis expected that demands on its resources will increase in the last 6\r\nmonths of the fiscal year 1946. Requests for loans are constantly being\r\nreceived by the Bank from countries desiring to secure goods and services\r\nin this country for the reconstruction or development of their economies.\r\nOn July 31, 1945, the lending authority of the Expert-Import Bank was\r\nincreased to a total of 3,500 million dollars. I anticipate that during the\r\nperiod covered by this Budget the Bank will reach this limit. The bulk of\r\nthe expenditures from the loans already granted will fall in the fiscal\r\nyear 1946 while the bulk of the expenditures from loans yet to be\r\nnegotiated will fall in the fiscal year 1947. In view of the urgent need\r\nfor the Bank's credit, I may find it necessary to request a further\r\nincrease in its lending authority at a later date.\r\n\r\n(d) The proposed line of credit of 3,750 million dollars to the United\r\nKingdom will be available up to the end of 1951 and will be used to assist\r\nthe United Kingdom in financing the deficit in its balance of payments\r\nduring the transition period. The rate at which the United Kingdom will\r\ndraw on the credit will depend on the rapidity with which it can reconvert\r\nits economy and adapt its trade to the postwar world. The anticipated rate\r\nof expenditure is likely to be heaviest during the next 2 years.\r\n\r\n(e) Since the Bretton Woods Agreements have now been approved by the\r\nrequired number of countries, both the International Monetary fund and the\r\nInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development will commence\r\noperations during 1946. The organization of these institutions will\r\nundoubtedly take some time, and it is unlikely that their operations will\r\nreach any appreciable scale before the beginning of the fiscal year 1947.\r\n\r\nOf the 2,750 million dollars required for the fund, 1,800 million dollars\r\nwill be provided in cash or notes from the exchange stabilization fund\r\nestablished under the Gold Reserve Act of 1934. The remaining 950 million\r\ndollars will be paid initially in the form of non-interest-bearing notes\r\nissued by the Secretary of the Treasury. It is not anticipated that the\r\nfund will require in cash any of the 950 million dollars during the fiscal\r\nyears 1946 and 1947. Consequently, no cash withdrawals from the Treasury\r\nwill be required in connection with the fund in these years.\r\n\r\nThe subscription to the Bank amounts to 3,175 million dollars. Of this\r\ntotal, 2 percent must be paid immediately and the Bank is required to call\r\na further 8 percent of the subscription during its first year of\r\noperations. The balance of the subscription is payable when required by the\r\nBank either for direct lending or to make good its guarantees. It is likely\r\nthat the United States will be required to pay little if any more than the\r\ninitial 10 percent before the end of the fiscal year 1947.\r\n\r\nI anticipate that net expenditures of the Export-Import Bank and\r\nexpenditures arising from the British credit and the Bretton Woods\r\nAgreements will amount to 2,614 million dollars, including the noncash item\r\nof 950 million dollars for the fund, in the fiscal year 1946, and 2,754\r\nmillion dollars in the fiscal year 1947.\r\n\r\nGENERAL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nThe responsibilities of the Government, in both domestic and international\r\naffairs, have increased greatly in the past decade. Consequently, the\r\nGovernment is larger than it was before the war, and its general operating\r\ncosts are higher. We cannot shrink the Government to prewar dimensions\r\nunless we slough off these new responsibilities--and we cannot do that\r\nwithout paying an excessive price in terms of our national welfare. We can,\r\nhowever, enhance its operating efficiency through improved organization. I\r\nexpect to make such improvements under the authority of the Reorganization\r\nAct of 1945.\r\n\r\nThe appropriations which I am recommending for general government for the\r\nfiscal year 1947 are 1,604 million dollars under existing legislation. This\r\nis an increase of 458 million dollars over the total of enacted\r\nappropriations for the current fiscal year, but a substantial part of this\r\nincrease is due to the fact that the appropriations for the fiscal year\r\n1946 were made prior to the general increase of employees' salaries last\r\nJuly 1, for which allowance is made in the anticipated supplemental\r\nappropriations for 1946. The recommended total for 1947 for general\r\ngovernment, like the estimates for national defense and other specific\r\nprograms, does not allow for the further salary increases for Government\r\nemployees which, I hope, will be authorized by pending legislation, but-the\r\ntentative lump-sum estimates under proposed legislation contemplate that\r\nsuch salary increases will be effective almost at once.\r\n\r\nExpenditures for general government in the fiscal year 1947 are expected to\r\ncontinue the slowly rising trend which began in 1943. This category\r\nincludes a great variety of items--not merely the overhead costs of the\r\nGovernment. It includes all the expenditures of the Cabinet departments,\r\nother than for national defense, aids to agriculture, general public works,\r\nand the social security program. It includes also expenditures of the\r\nlegislative branch, the Judiciary, and many of the independent agencies of\r\nthe executive branch. Consequently, the estimated increase in 1947 in the\r\ntotal of general government expenditures reflects a variety of influences.\r\n\r\nNow included in general government are certain activities formerly\r\nclassified under national defense. Some of these, such as certain functions\r\nof the former foreign Economic Administration and the War Manpower\r\nCommission, are still needed during the period of reconversion; others are\r\nin the process of liquidation. A few wartime activities, for example, the\r\ninternational information and foreign intelligence services and some of the\r\nwartime programs for controlling disease and crime, have become part of our\r\nregular government establishment. Expenditures for these former wartime\r\nfunctions explain about 40 percent of the increase in expenditures for\r\ngeneral government.\r\n\r\nOther increases are for civil aeronautics promotion, the business and\r\nmanufacturing censuses, and other expanded business services of the\r\nDepartment of Commerce which have been referred to above; the forest and\r\nSoil Conservation Services and other committees of the Department of\r\ncertain conservation activities of the Department of the Interior; and the\r\ncollection of internal revenue in the Treasury Department.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for reestablishing postal services curtailed during the war\r\nand advances in the rates of pay for postal employees have increased\r\nsubstantially the estimated expenditures for postal service for both the\r\ncurrent and the next fiscal year. It is not expected that this increase\r\nwill cause expenditures to exceed postal revenues in either year, although\r\nan excess of expenditures may occur in the fiscal year 1947 if salaries are\r\nincreased further.\r\n\r\nExpenditures for our share of the administrative budgets of the United\r\nNations and other permanent international bodies will increase sharply in\r\nthe fiscal year 1947, yet will remain a small part of our total Budget. The\r\nbudget for the United Nations has not yet been determined; an estimate for\r\nour contribution will be submitted later. Our contributions to the food and\r\nAgriculture Organization, the International Labor Office, the Pan American\r\nUnion, and other similar international agencies will aggregate about 3\r\nmillion dollars for the fiscal year 1947. The administrative expenses of\r\nthe International Monetary fund and the International Bank will be met from\r\ntheir general funds.\r\n\r\nWe have won a great war--we, the nations of plain people who hate war. In\r\nthe test of that war we found a strength of unity that brought us\r\nthrough--a strength that crushed the power of those who sought by force to\r\ndeny our faith in the dignity of man.\r\n\r\nDuring this trial the voices of disunity among us were silent or were\r\nsubdued to an occasional whine that warned us that they were still among\r\nus. Those voices are beginning to cry aloud again. We must learn constantly\r\nto turn deaf ears to them. They are voices which foster fear and suspicion\r\nand intolerance and hate. They seek to destroy our harmony, our\r\nunderstanding of each other, our American tradition of \"live and let live.\"\r\nThey have become busy again, trying to set race against race, creed against\r\ncreed, farmer against city dweller, worker against employer, people against\r\ntheir own governments. They seek only to do us mischief. They must not\r\nprevail.\r\n\r\nIt should be impossible for any man to contemplate without a sense of\r\npersonal humility the tremendous events of the 12 months since the last\r\nannual Message, the great tasks that confront us, the new and huge problems\r\nof the coming months and years. Yet these very things justify the deepest\r\nconfidence in the future of this Nation of free men and women.\r\n\r\nThe plain people of this country found the courage and the strength, the\r\nself-discipline, and the mutual respect to fight and to win, with the help\r\nof our allies, under God. I doubt if the tasks of the future are more\r\ndifficult. But if they are, then I say that our strength and our knowledge\r\nand our understanding will be equal to those tasks.\r\n\r\nAs printed above, references to tables appearing in the budget document\r\nhave been omitted.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nHarry S. Truman\r\nJanuary 6, 1947\r\n\r\nMr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Congress of the United States:\r\n\r\nIt looks like a good many of you have moved over to the left since I was\r\nhere last!\r\n\r\nI come before you today to report on the State of the Union and, in the\r\nwords of the Constitution, to recommend such measures as I judge necessary\r\nand expedient.\r\n\r\nI come also to welcome you as you take up your duties and to discuss with\r\nyou the manner in which you and I should fulfill our obligations to the\r\nAmerican people during the next 2 years.\r\n\r\nThe power to mold the future of this Nation lies in our hands--yours and\r\nmine, and they are joined together by the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIf in this year, and in the next, we can find the right course to take as\r\neach issue arises, and if, in spite of all difficulties, we have the\r\ncourage and the resolution to take that course, then we shall achieve a\r\nstate of well-being for our people without precedent in history. And if we\r\ncontinue to work with the other nations of the world earnestly, patiently,\r\nand wisely, we can--granting a will for peace on the part of our\r\nneighbors-make a lasting peace for the world.\r\n\r\nBut, if we are to realize these ends, the Congress and the President,\r\nduring the next 2 years, must work together. It is not unusual in our\r\nhistory that the majority of the Congress represents a party in opposition\r\nto the President's party. I am the twentieth President of the United States\r\nwho, at some time during his term of office, has found his own party to be\r\nin the minority in one or both Houses of Congress. The first one was George\r\nWashington. Wilson was number eighteen, and Hoover was number nineteen.\r\n\r\nI realize that on some matters the Congress and the President may have\r\nhonest differences of opinion. Partisan differences, however, did not cause\r\nmaterial disagreements as to the conduct of the war. Nor, in the conduct of\r\nour international relations, during and since the war, have such partisan\r\ndifferences been material.\r\n\r\nOn some domestic issues we may, and probably shall, disagree. That in\r\nitself is not to be feared. It is inherent in our form of Government. But\r\nthere are ways of disagreeing; men who differ can still work together\r\nsincerely for the common good. We shall be risking the Nation's safety and\r\ndestroying our opportunities for progress if we do not settle any\r\ndisagreements in this spirit, without thought of partisan advantage.\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL DOMESTIC ECONOMY\r\n\r\nAs the year 1947 begins, the state of our national economy presents great\r\nopportunities for all. We have virtually full employment. Our national\r\nproduction of goods and services is 50 percent higher than in any year\r\nprior to the war emergency. The national income in 1946 was higher than in\r\nany peacetime year. Our food production is greater than it has ever been.\r\nDuring the last 5 years our productive facilities have been expanded in\r\nalmost every field. The American standard of living is higher now than ever\r\nbefore, and when the housing shortage can be overcome it will be even\r\nhigher.\r\n\r\nDuring the past few months we have removed at a rapid rate the emergency\r\ncontrols that the Federal Government had to exercise during the war. The\r\nremaining controls will be retained only as long as they are needed to\r\nprotect the public. Private enterprise must be given the greatest possible\r\nfreedom to continue the expansion of economy.\r\n\r\nIn my proclamation of December 31, 1946 I announced the termination of\r\nhostilities. This automatically ended certain temporary legislation and\r\ncertain executive powers.\r\n\r\nTwo groups of temporary laws still remain: the first are those which by\r\nCongressional mandate are to last during the \"emergency\"; the second are\r\nthose which are to continue until the \"termination of the war,\"\r\n\r\nI shall submit to the Congress recommendations for the repeal of certain of\r\nthe statutes which by their terms continue for the duration of the\r\n\"emergency.\" I shall at the same time recommend that others within this\r\nclassification be extended until the state of war has been ended by treaty\r\nor by legislative action. As to those statutes which continue until the\r\nstate of war has been terminated, I urge that the Congress promptly\r\nconsider each statute individually, and repeal such emergency legislation\r\nwhere it is advisable.\r\n\r\nNow that nearly all wartime controls have been removed, the operation of\r\nour industrial system depends to a greater extent on the decisions of\r\nbusinessmen, farmers, and workers. These decisions must be wisely made with\r\ngenuine concern for public welfare. The welfare of businessmen, farmers,\r\nand workers depends upon the economic well-being of those who buy their\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nAn important present source of danger to our economy is the possibility\r\nthat prices might be raised to such an extent that the consuming public\r\ncould not purchase the tremendous volume of goods and services which will\r\nbe produced during 1947.\r\n\r\nWe all know that recent price increases have denied to many of our workers\r\nmuch of the value of recent wage increases. Farmers have found that a large\r\npart of their increased income has been absorbed by increased prices. While\r\nsome of our people have received raises in income which exceed price\r\nincreases, the great majority have not. Those persons who live on modest\r\nfixed incomes--retired persons living on pensions, for example--and workers\r\nwhose incomes are relatively inflexible, such as teachers and other civil\r\nservants--have suffered hardship.\r\n\r\nIn the effort to bring about a sound and equitable price structure, each\r\ngroup of our population has its own responsibilities.\r\n\r\nIt is up to industry not only to hold the line on existing prices, but to\r\nmake reductions whenever profits justify such action.\r\n\r\nIt is up to labor to refrain from pressing for unjustified wage increases\r\nthat will force increases in the price level.\r\n\r\nAnd it is up to Government to do everything in its power to encourage\r\nhigh-volume Production, for that is what makes possible good wages, low\r\nprices, and reasonable profits.\r\n\r\nIn a few days there will be submitted to the Congress the Economic Report\r\nof the President, and also the Budget Message. Those messages will contain\r\nmany recommendations. Today I shall outline five major economic policies\r\nwhich I believe the Government should pursue during 1947. These policies\r\nare designed to meet our immediate needs and, at the same time, to provide\r\nfor the long-range welfare of our free enterprise system:\r\n\r\nFirst, the promotion of greater harmony between labor and management.\r\n\r\nSecond, restriction of monopoly and unfair business practices; assistance\r\nto small business; and the promotion of the free competitive system of\r\nprivate enterprise.\r\n\r\nThird, continuation of an aggressive program of home construction.\r\n\r\nFourth, the balancing of the budget in the next fiscal year and the\r\nachieving of a substantial surplus to be applied to the reduction of the\r\npublic debt.\r\n\r\nFifth, protection of a fair level of return to farmers in post-war\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nLABOR AND MANAGEMENT\r\n\r\nThe year just past--like the year after the first World War--was marred by\r\nlabor management strife.\r\n\r\nDespite this outbreak of economic warfare in 1946, we are today producing\r\ngoods and services in record volume. Nevertheless, it is essential to\r\nimprove the methods for reaching agreement between labor and management and\r\nto reduce the number of strikes and lockouts.\r\n\r\nWe must not, however, adopt punitive legislation. We must not in order to\r\npunish a few labor leaders, pass vindictive laws which will restrict the\r\nproper rights of the rank and file of labor. We must not, under the stress\r\nof emotion, endanger our American freedoms by taking ill-considered action\r\nwhich will lead to results not anticipated or desired.\r\n\r\nWe must remember, in reviewing the record of disputes in 1946, that\r\nmanagement shares with labor the responsibility for failure to reach\r\nagreements which would have averted strikes. For that reason, we must\r\nrealize that industrial peace cannot be achieved merely by laws directed\r\nagainst labor unions.\r\n\r\nDuring the last decade and a half, we have established a national labor\r\npolicy in this country based upon free collective bargaining as the process\r\nfor determining wages and working conditions.\r\n\r\nThat is still the national policy.\r\n\r\nAnd it should continue to be the national policy!\r\n\r\nBut as yet, not all of us have learned what it means to bargain freely and\r\nfairly. Nor have all of us learned to carry the mutual responsibilities\r\nthat accompany the right to bargain. There have been abuses and harmful\r\npractices which limit the effectiveness of our system of collective\r\nbargaining. Furthermore, we have lacked sufficient governmental machinery\r\nto aid labor and management in resolving their differences.\r\n\r\nCertain labor-management problems need attention at once and certain\r\nothers, by reason of their complexity, need exhaustive investigation and\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nWe should enact legislation to correct certain abuses and to provide\r\nadditional governmental assistance in bargaining. But we should also\r\nconcern ourselves with the basic causes of labor-management difficulties.\r\n\r\nIn the light of these considerations, I propose to you and urge your\r\ncooperation in effecting the following four-point program to reduce\r\nindustrial strife:\r\n\r\nPoint number one is the early enactment of legislation to prevent certain\r\nunjustifiable practices.\r\n\r\nFirst, under this point, are jurisdictional strikes. In such strikes the\r\npublic and the employer are innocent bystanders who are injured by a\r\ncollision between rival unions. This type of dispute hurts production,\r\nindustry, and the public--and labor itself. I consider jurisdictional\r\nstrikes indefensible.\r\n\r\nThe National Labor Relations Act provides procedures for determining which\r\nunion represents employees of a particular employer. In some jurisdictional\r\ndisputes, however, minority unions strike to compel employers to deal with\r\nthem despite a legal duty to bargain with the majority union. Strikes to\r\ncompel an employer to violate the law are inexcusable. Legislation to\r\nprevent such strikes is clearly desirable.\r\n\r\nAnother form of inter-union disagreement is the jurisdictional strike\r\ninvolving the question of which labor union is entitled to perform a\r\nparticular task. When rival unions are unable to settle such disputes\r\nthemselves, provision must be made for peaceful and binding determination\r\nof the issues.\r\n\r\nA second unjustifiable practice is the secondary boycott, when used to\r\nfurther jurisdictional disputes or to compel employers to violate the\r\nNational Labor Relations Act.\r\n\r\nNot all secondary boycotts are unjustified. We must judge them on the basis\r\nof their objectives. For example, boycotts intended to protect wage rates\r\nand working conditions should be distinguished from those in furtherance of\r\njurisdictional disputes. The structure of industry sometimes requires\r\nunions, as a matter of self-preservation, to extend the conflict beyond a\r\nparticular employer. There should be no blanket prohibition against\r\nboycotts. The appropriate goal is legislation which prohibits secondary\r\nboycotts in pursuance of unjustifiable objectives, but does not impair the\r\nunion's right to preserve its own existence and the gains made in genuine\r\ncollective bargaining.\r\n\r\nA third practice that should be corrected is the use of economic force, by\r\neither labor or management, to decide issues arising out of the\r\ninterpretation of existing contracts.\r\n\r\nCollective bargaining agreements, like other contracts, should be\r\nfaithfully adhered to by both parties. In the most enlightened\r\nunion-management relationships, disputes over the interpretation of\r\ncontract terms are settled peaceably by negotiation or arbitration.\r\nLegislation should be enacted to provide machinery whereby unsettled\r\ndisputes concerning the interpretation of an existing agreement may be\r\nreferred by either party to final and binding arbitration.\r\n\r\nPoint number two is the extension of facilities within the Department of\r\nLabor for assisting collective bargaining.\r\n\r\nOne of our difficulties in avoiding labor strife arises from a lack of\r\norder in the collective bargaining process. The parties often do not have a\r\ndear understanding of their responsibility for settling disputes through\r\ntheir own negotiations. We constantly see instances where labor or\r\nmanagement resorts to economic force without exhausting the possibilities\r\nfor agreement through the bargaining process. Neither the parties nor the\r\nGovernment have a definite yardstick for determining when and how\r\nGovernment assistance should be invoked. There is need for integrated\r\ngovernmental machinery to provide the successive steps of mediation,\r\nvoluntary arbitration, and--ultimately in appropriate cases--ascertainment\r\nof the facts of the dispute and the reporting of the facts to the public.\r\nSuch machinery would facilitate and expedite the settlement of disputes.\r\n\r\nPoint number three is the broadening of our program of social legislation\r\nto alleviate the causes of workers' insecurity.\r\n\r\nOn June 11, 1946, in my message vetoing the Case Bill, I made a\r\ncomprehensive statement of my views concerning labor-management relations.\r\nI said then, and I repeat now, that the solution of labor-management\r\ndifficulties is to be found not only in legislation dealing directly with\r\nlabor relations, but also in a program designed to remove the causes of\r\ninsecurity felt by many workers in our industrial society. In this\r\nconnection, for example, the Congress should consider the extension and\r\nbroadening of our social security system, better housing, a comprehensive\r\nnational health program, and provision for a fair minimum wage.\r\n\r\nPoint number four is the appointment of a Temporary Joint Commission to\r\ninquire into the entire field of labor-management relations.\r\n\r\nI recommend that the Congress provide for the appointment of a Temporary\r\nJoint Commission to undertake this broad study.\r\n\r\nThe President, the Congress, and management and labor have a continuing\r\nresponsibility to cooperate in seeking and finding the solution of these\r\nproblems. I therefore recommend that the Commission be composed as follows:\r\ntwelve to be chosen by the Congress from members of both parties in the\r\nHouse and the Senate, and eight representing the public, management and\r\nlabor, to be appointed by the President.\r\n\r\nThe Commission should be charged with investigating and making\r\nrecommendations upon certain major subjects, among others:\r\n\r\nFirst, the special and unique problem of nationwide strikes in vital\r\nindustries affecting the public interest. In particular, the Commission\r\nshould examine into the question of how to settle or prevent such strikes\r\nwithout endangering our general democratic freedoms.\r\n\r\nUpon a proper solution of this problem may depend the whole industrial\r\nfuture of the United States. The paralyzing effects of a nationwide strike\r\nin such industries as transportation, coal, oil, steel, or communications\r\ncan result in national disaster. We have been able to avoid such disaster,\r\nin recent years, only by the use of extraordinary war powers. All those\r\npowers will soon be gone. In their place there must be created an adequate\r\nsystem and effective machinery in these vital fields. This problem will\r\nrequire careful study and a bold approach, but an approach consistent with\r\nthe preservation of the rights of our people. The need is pressing. The\r\nCommission should give this its earliest attention.\r\n\r\nSecond, the best methods and procedures for carrying out the collective\r\nbargaining process. This should include the responsibilities of labor and\r\nmanagement to negotiate freely and fairly with each other, and to refrain\r\nfrom strikes or lockouts until all possibilities of negotiation have been\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\nThird, the underlying causes of labor management disputes.\r\n\r\nSome of the subjects presented here for investigation involve long-range\r\nstudy. Others can be considered immediately by the Commission and its\r\nrecommendations can be submitted to the Congress in the near future.\r\n\r\nI recommend that this Commission make its first report, including specific\r\nlegislative recommendations, not later than March 15, 1947.\r\n\r\nRESTRICTION Of MONOPOLY AND PROMOTION OF PRIVATE ENTERPRISE\r\n\r\nThe second major policy I desire to lay before you has to do with the\r\ngrowing concentration of economic power and the threat to free competitive\r\nprivate enterprise. In 1941 the Temporary National Economic Committee\r\ncompleted a comprehensive investigation into the workings of the national\r\neconomy. The Committee's study showed that, despite a half century of\r\nanti-trust law enforcement, one of the gravest threats to our welfare lay\r\nin the increasing concentration of power in the hands of a small number of\r\ngiant organizations.\r\n\r\nDuring the war, this long-standing tendency toward economic concentration\r\nwas accelerated. As a consequence, we now find that to a greater extent\r\nthan ever before, whole industries are dominated by one or a few large\r\norganizations which can restrict production in the interest of higher\r\nprofits and thus reduce employment and purchasing power.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to assure full opportunity and free competition to business we\r\nwill vigorously enforce the anti-trust laws. There is much the Congress can\r\ndo to cooperate and assist in this program.\r\n\r\nTo strengthen and enforce the laws that regulate business practices is not\r\nenough. Enforcement must be supplemented by positive measures of aid to new\r\nenterprises. Government assistance, research programs, and credit powers\r\nshould be designed and used to promote the growth of new firms and new\r\nindustries. Assistance to small business is particularly important at this\r\ntime when thousands of veterans who are potential business and industrial\r\nleaders are beginning their careers.\r\n\r\nWe should also give special attention to the decentralization of industry\r\nand the development of areas that are now under-industrialized.\r\n\r\nHOUSING\r\n\r\nThe third major policy is also of great importance to the national economy:\r\nan aggressive program to encourage housing construction. The first federal\r\nprogram to relieve the veterans' housing shortage was announced in February\r\n1946. In 1946 one million family housing units have been put under\r\nconstruction and more than 665,000 units have already been completed. The\r\nrate of expansion in construction has broken all records.\r\n\r\nIn the coming year the number of dwelling units built will approach, if not\r\nsurpass, the top construction year of 1926. The primary responsibility to\r\ndeliver housing at reasonable prices that veterans can afford rests with\r\nprivate industry and with labor. The Government will continue to expedite\r\nthe flow of key building materials, to limit nonresidential construction,\r\nand to give financial support where it will do the most good. Measures to\r\nstimulate rental housing and new types of housing construction will receive\r\nspecial emphasis.\r\n\r\nTo reach our long-range goal of adequate housing for all our people,\r\ncomprehensive housing legislation is urgently required, similar to the\r\nnon-partisan bill passed by the Senate last year. At a minimum, such\r\nlegislation should open the way for rebuilding the blighted areas of our\r\ncities and should establish positive incentives for the investment of\r\nbillions of dollars of private capital in large-scale rental housing\r\nprojects. It should provide for improvement of housing in rural areas and\r\nfor the construction, over a 4-year period, of half a million units of\r\npublic low-rental housing. It should authorize a single peacetime federal\r\nhousing agency to assure efficient use of our resources on the vast housing\r\nfront.\r\n\r\nFISCAL AFFAIRS\r\n\r\nThe fourth major policy has to do with the balancing of the budget. In a\r\nprosperous period such as the present one, the budget of the Federal\r\nGovernment should be balanced. Prudent management of public finance\r\nrequires that we begin the process of reducing the public debt. The budget\r\nwhich I shall submit to you this week has a small margin of surplus. In the\r\nBudget Message I am making recommendations which, if accepted, will result\r\nin a substantially larger surplus which should be applied to debt\r\nretirement. One of these recommendations is that the Congress take early\r\naction to continue throughout the next fiscal year the war excise tax rates\r\nwhich, under the present law, will expire on June 30, 1947.\r\n\r\nExpenditures relating to the war are still high. Considerable sums are\r\nrequired to alleviate world famine and suffering. Aid to veterans will\r\ncontinue at peak level. The world situation is such that large military\r\nexpenditures are required. Interest on the public debt and certain other\r\ncosts are irreducible. For these reasons I have had to practice stringent\r\neconomy in preparing the budget; and I hope that the Congress will\r\ncooperate in this program of economy.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nThe fifth major policy has to do with the welfare of our farm population.\r\n\r\nProduction of food reached record heights in 1946. Much of our tremendous\r\ngrain crop can readily be sold abroad and thus will become no threat to our\r\ndomestic markets. But in the next few years American agriculture can face\r\nthe same dangers it did after World War I. In the early twenties the Nation\r\nfailed to maintain outlets for the new productive capacity of our\r\nagricultural plant. It failed to provide means to protect the farmer while\r\nhe adjusted his acreage to peacetime demands.\r\n\r\nThe result we all remember too well. Farm production stayed up while demand\r\nand prices fell, in contrast with industry where prices stayed up and\r\noutput declined, farm surpluses piled up, and disaster followed.\r\n\r\nWe must make sure of meeting the problems which we failed to meet after the\r\nfirst World War. Present laws give considerable stability to farm prices\r\nfor 1947 and 1948, and these 2 years must be utilized to maintain and\r\ndevelop markets for our great productive power.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of these laws was to permit an orderly transition from war to\r\npeace. The Government plan of support prices was not designed to absorb, at\r\ngreat cost, the unlimited surpluses of a highly productive agriculture.\r\n\r\nWe must not wait until the guarantees expire to set the stage for permanent\r\nfarm welfare.\r\n\r\nThe farmer is entitled to a fair income.\r\n\r\nWays can be found to utilize his new skills and better practices, to expand\r\nhis markets at home and abroad, and to carry out the objectives of a\r\nbalanced pattern of peacetime production without either undue sacrifice by\r\nfarm people or undue expense to the Government.\r\n\r\nHEALTH AND GENERAL WELFARE\r\n\r\nOf all our national resources, none is of more basic value than the health\r\nof our people. Over a year ago I presented to the Congress my views on a\r\nnational health program. The Congress acted on several of the\r\nrecommendations in this program-mental health, the health of mothers and\r\nchildren, and hospital construction. I urge this Congress to complete the\r\nwork begun last year and to enact the most important recommendation of the\r\nprogram--to provide adequate medical care to all who need it, not as\r\ncharity but on the basis of payments made by the beneficiaries of the\r\nprogram.\r\n\r\nOne administrative change would help greatly to further our national\r\nprogram in the fields of health, education, and welfare. I again recommend\r\nthe establishment of a well-integrated Department of Welfare.\r\n\r\nVETERANS\r\n\r\nFourteen million World War II servicemen have returned to civil life. The\r\ngreat majority have found their places as citizens of their communities and\r\ntheir Nation. It is a tribute to the fiber of our servicemen and to the\r\nflexibility of our economy that these adjustments have been made so rapidly\r\nand so successfully.\r\n\r\nMore than two million of these veterans are attending schools or acquiring\r\njob skills through the financial assistance of the Federal Government.\r\nThousands of sick and wounded veterans are daily receiving the best of\r\nmedical and hospital care. Half a million have obtained loans, with\r\nGovernment guarantees, to purchase homes or farms or to embark upon new\r\nbusinesses. Compensation is being paid in almost two million cases for\r\ndisabilities or death. More than three million are continuing to maintain\r\ntheir low-cost National Service Life Insurance policies. Almost seven\r\nmillion veterans have been aided by unemployment and self-employment\r\nallowances.\r\n\r\nExclusive of mustering-out payments and terminal leave pay, the program for\r\nveterans of all wars is costing over seven billion dollars a\r\nyear--one-fifth of our total federal budget. This is the most far-reaching\r\nand complete veterans program ever conceived by any nation.\r\n\r\nExcept for minor adjustments, I believe that our program of benefits for\r\nveterans is now complete. In the long run, the success of the program will\r\nnot be measured by the number of veterans receiving financial aid or by the\r\nnumber of dollars we spend. History will judge us not by the money we\r\nspend, but by the further contribution we enable our veterans to make to\r\ntheir country. In considering any additional legislation, that must be our\r\ncriterion.\r\n\r\nCIVIL RIGHTS\r\n\r\nWe have recently witnessed in this country numerous attacks upon the\r\nconstitutional rights of individual citizens as a result of racial and\r\nreligious bigotry. Substantial segments of our people have been prevented\r\nfrom exercising fully their right to participate in the election of public\r\nofficials, both locally and nationally. Freedom to engage in lawful\r\ncallings has been denied.\r\n\r\nThe will to fight these crimes should be in the hearts of every one of us.\r\n\r\nFor the Federal Government that fight is now being carried on by the\r\nDepartment of Justice to the full extent of the powers that have been\r\nconferred upon it. While the Constitution withholds from the Federal\r\nGovernment the major task of preserving peace in the several States, I am\r\nnot convinced that the present legislation reached the limit of federal\r\npower to protect the civil rights of its citizens.\r\n\r\nI have, therefore, by Executive Order,[1] established the President's\r\nCommittee on Civil Rights to study and report on the whole problem of\r\nfederally-secured civil rights, with a view to making recommendations to\r\nthe Congress.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Executive Order 9808 (3 CFR, 1943-1948 Comp., p. 590.)]\r\n\r\nNATURAL RESOURCES\r\n\r\nIn our responsibility to promote the general welfare of the people, we have\r\nalways to consider the natural resources of our country. They are the\r\nfoundation of our life. In the development of the great river systems of\r\nAmerica there is the major opportunity of our generation to contribute to\r\nthe increase of the national wealth. This program is already well along; it\r\nshould be pushed with full vigor.\r\n\r\nI must advise the Congress that we are rapidly becoming a \"have not\" Nation\r\nas to many of our minerals. The economic progress and the security of our\r\ncountry depend upon an expanding return of mineral discovery and upon\r\nimproved methods of recovery. The Federal Government must do its part to\r\nmeet this need.\r\n\r\nFOREIGN AFFAIRS\r\n\r\nProgress in reaching our domestic goals is closely related to our conduct\r\nof foreign affairs. All that I have said about maintaining a sound and\r\nprosperous economy and improving the welfare of our people has greater\r\nmeaning because of the world leadership of the United States. What we do,\r\nor fail to do, at home affects not only ourselves but millions throughout\r\nthe world. If we are to fulfill our responsibilities to ourselves and to\r\nother peoples, we must make sure that the United States is sound\r\neconomically, socially, and politically. Only then will we be able to help\r\nbring about the elements of peace in other countries--political stability,\r\neconomic advancement, and social progress.\r\n\r\nPeace treaties for Italy, Bulgaria, Rumania, and Hungary have finally been\r\nprepared. Following the signing of these treaties next month in Paris, they\r\nwill be submitted to the Senate for ratification. This Government does not\r\nregard the treaties as completely satisfactory. Whatever their defects,\r\nhowever, I am convinced that they are as good as we can hope to obtain by\r\nagreement among the principal wartime Allies. Further dispute and delay\r\nwould gravely jeopardize political stability in the countries concerned for\r\nmany years.\r\n\r\nDuring the long months of debate on these treaties, we have made it clear\r\nto all nations that the United States will not consent to settlements at\r\nthe expense of principles we regard as vital to a just and enduring peace.\r\nWe have made it equally dear that we will not retreat to isolationism. Our\r\npolicies will be the same during the forthcoming negotiations in Moscow on\r\nthe German and Austrian treaties, and during the future conferences on the\r\nJapanese treaty.\r\n\r\nThe delay in arriving at the first peace settlements is due partly to the\r\ndifficulty of reaching agreement with the Soviet Union on the terms of\r\nsettlement. Whatever differences there may have been between us and the\r\nSoviet Union, however, should not be allowed to obscure the fact that the\r\nbasic interests of both nations lie in the early making of a peace under\r\nwhich the peoples of all countries may return, as free men and women, to\r\nthe essential tasks of production and reconstruction. The major concern of\r\neach of us should be the promotion of collective security, not the\r\nadvancement of individual security.\r\n\r\nOur policy toward the Soviet Union is guided by the same principles which\r\ndetermine our policies toward all nations. We seek only to uphold the\r\nprinciples of international justice which have been embodied in the Charter\r\nof the United Nations.\r\n\r\nWe must now get on with the peace settlements. The occupying powers should\r\nrecognize the independence of Austria and withdraw their troops. The\r\nGermans and the Japanese cannot be left in doubt and fear as to their\r\nfuture; they must know their national boundaries, their resources, and what\r\nreparations they must pay. Without trying to manage their internal affairs,\r\nwe can insure that these countries do not re-arm.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL RELIEF AND DISPLACED PERSONS\r\n\r\nThe United States can be proud of its part in caring for the peoples\r\nreduced to want by the ravages of war, and in aiding nations to restore\r\ntheir national economies. We have shipped more supplies to the hungry\r\npeoples of the world since the end of the war than all other countries\r\ncombined!\r\n\r\nHowever, insofar as admitting displaced persons is concerned, I do not feel\r\nthat the United States has done its part. Only about 5,000 of them have\r\nentered this country since May, 1946. The fact is that the executive\r\nagencies are now doing all that is reasonably possible under the limitation\r\nof the existing law and established quotas. Congressional assistance in the\r\nform of new legislation is needed. I urge the Congress to turn its\r\nattention to this world problem, in an effort to find ways whereby we can\r\nfulfill our responsibilities to these thousands of homeless and suffering\r\nrefugees of all faiths.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL TRADE\r\n\r\nWorld economic cooperation is essential to world political cooperation. We\r\nhave made a good start on economic cooperation through the International\r\nBank, the International Monetary fund, and the Export-Import Bank. We must\r\nnow take other steps for the reconstruction of world trade and we should\r\ncontinue to strive for an international trade system as free from\r\nobstructions as possible.\r\n\r\nATOMIC ENERGY\r\n\r\nThe United States has taken the lead in the endeavor to put atomic energy\r\nunder effective international control. We seek no monopoly for ourselves or\r\nfor any group of nations. We ask only that there be safeguards sufficient\r\nto insure that no nation will be able to use this power for military\r\npurposes. So long as all governments are not agreed on means of\r\ninternational control of atomic energy, the shadow of fear will obscure the\r\nbright prospects for the peaceful use of this enormous power.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, the Commission\r\nestablished under that law is assuming full jurisdiction over domestic\r\natomic energy enterprise. The program of the Commission will, of course, be\r\nworked out in close collaboration with the military services in conformity\r\nwith the wish of the Congress, but it is my fervent hope that the military\r\nsignificance of atomic energy will steadily decline. We look to the\r\nCommission to foster the development of atomic energy for industrial use\r\nand scientific and medical research. In the vigorous and effective\r\ndevelopment of peaceful uses of atomic energy rests our hope that this new\r\nforce may ultimately be turned into a blessing for all nations.\r\n\r\nMILITARY POLICY\r\n\r\nIn 1946 the Army and Navy completed the demobilization of their wartime\r\nforces. They are now maintaining the forces which we need for national\r\ndefense and to fulfill our international obligations.\r\n\r\nWe live in a world in which strength on the part of peace-loving nations is\r\nstill the greatest deterrent to aggression. World stability can be\r\ndestroyed when nations with great responsibilities neglect to maintain the\r\nmeans of discharging those responsibilities.\r\n\r\nThis is an age when unforeseen attack could come with unprecedented speed.\r\nWe must be strong enough to defeat, and thus forestall, any such attack. In\r\nour steady Progress toward a more rational world order, the need for large\r\narmed forces is progressively declining; but the stabilizing force of\r\nAmerican military strength must not be weakened until our hopes are fully\r\nrealized. When a system of collective security under the United Nations has\r\nbeen established, we shall be willing to lead in collective disarmament,\r\nbut, until such a system becomes a reality, we must not again allow\r\nourselves to become weak and invite attack.\r\n\r\nFor those reasons, we need well-equipped, well-trained armed forces and we\r\nmust be able to mobilize rapidly our resources in men and material for our\r\nown defense, should the need arise.\r\n\r\nThe Army will be reduced to 1,070,000 officers and men by July 1, 1947.\r\nHalf of the Army will be used for occupation duties abroad and most of the\r\nremainder will be employed at home in the support of these overseas\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nThe Navy is supporting the occupation troops in Europe and in the Far East.\r\nIts fundamental mission--to support our national interests wherever\r\nrequired--is unchanged. The Navy, including the Marine Corps, will average\r\n571,000 officers and men during the fiscal year 1948.\r\n\r\nWe are encountering serious difficulties in maintaining our forces at even\r\nthese reduced levels. Occupation troops are barely sufficient to carry out\r\nthe duties which our foreign policy requires. Our forces at home are at a\r\npoint where further reduction is impracticable. We should like an Army and\r\na Navy composed entirely of long-term volunteers, but in spite of liberal\r\ninducements the basic needs of the Army are not now being met by voluntary\r\nenlistments.\r\n\r\nThe War Department has advised me that it is unable to make an accurate\r\nforecast at the present time as to whether it will be possible to maintain\r\nthe strength of the Army by relying exclusively on volunteers. The\r\nsituation will be much clearer in a few weeks, when the results of the\r\ncampaign for volunteers are known. The War Department will make its\r\nrecommendations as to the need for the extension of Selective Service in\r\nsufficient time to enable the Congress to take action prior to the\r\nexpiration of the present law on March 31st. The responsibility for\r\nmaintaining our armed forces at the strength necessary for our national\r\nsafety rests with the Congress.\r\n\r\nThe development of a trained citizen reserve is also vital to our national\r\nsecurity. This can best be accomplished through universal training. I have\r\nappointed an Advisory Commission on Universal Training to study the various\r\nplans for a training program, and I expect that the recommendations of the\r\nCommission will be of benefit to the Congress and to me in reaching\r\ndecisions on this problem.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the military establishment is substantial. There is one certain\r\nway by which we can cut costs and at the same time enhance our national\r\nsecurity. That is by the establishment of a single Department of National\r\nDefense. I shall communicate with the Congress in the near future with\r\nreference to the establishment of a single Department of National Defense.\r\n\r\nNational security does not consist only of an army, a navy, and an air\r\nforce. It rests on a much broader basis. It depends on a sound economy of\r\nprices and wages, on prosperous agriculture, on satisfied and productive\r\nworkers, on a competitive private enterprise free from monopolistic\r\nrepression, on continued industrial harmony and production, on civil\r\nliberties and human freedoms-on all the forces which create in our men and\r\nwomen a strong moral fiber and spiritual stamina.\r\n\r\nBut we have a higher duty and a greater responsibility than the attainment\r\nof our own national security. Our goal is collective security for all\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nIf we can work in a spirit of understanding and mutual respect, we can\r\nfulfill this solemn obligation which rests upon us.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the American people can set the course of world history. If\r\nwe maintain and strengthen our cherished ideals, and if we share our great\r\nbounty with war-stricken people over the world, then the faith of our\r\ncitizens in freedom and democracy will be spread over the whole earth and\r\nfree men everywhere will share our devotion to those ideals.\r\n\r\nLet us have the will and the patience to this job together.\r\n\r\nMay the Lord strengthen us in our faith.\r\n\r\nMay He give us wisdom to lead the peoples of the world in His ways of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nHarry S. Truman\r\nJanuary 7, 1948\r\n\r\nMr. President, Mr. Speaker, and Members of the 80th Congress:\r\n\r\nWe are here today to consider the state of the Union.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, above all others, the Congress and the President should\r\nconcentrate their attention, not upon party but upon the country; not upon\r\nthings which divide us but upon those which bind us together--the enduring\r\nprinciples of our American system, and our common aspirations for the\r\nfuture welfare and security of the people of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe United States has become great because [p.2] we, as a people, have been\r\nable to work together for great objectives even while differing about\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nThe elements of our strength are many. They include our democratic\r\ngovernment, our economic system, our great natural resources. But these are\r\nonly partial explanations.\r\n\r\nThe basic source of our strength is spiritual. For we are a people with a\r\nfaith. We believe in the dignity of man. We believe that he was created in\r\nthe image of the Father of us all.\r\n\r\nWe do not believe that men exist merely to strengthen the state or to be\r\ncogs in the economic machine. We do believe that governments are created to\r\nserve the people and that economic systems exist to minister to their\r\nwants. We have a profound devotion to the welfare and rights of the\r\nindividual as a human being.\r\n\r\nThe faith of our people has particular meaning at this time in history\r\nbecause of the unsettled and changing state of the world.\r\n\r\nThe victims of war in many lands are striving to rebuild their lives, and\r\nare seeking assurance that the tragedy of war will not occur again.\r\nThroughout the world new ideas are challenging the old. Men of all nations\r\nare reexamining the beliefs by which they live. Great scientific and\r\nindustrial changes have released new forces which will affect the future\r\ncourse of civilization.\r\n\r\nThe state of our Union reflects the changing nature of the modern world. On\r\nall sides there is heartening evidence of great energy--of capacity for\r\neconomic development-and even more important, capacity for spiritual\r\ngrowth. But accompanying this great activity there are equally great\r\nquestions, great anxieties, and great aspirations. They represent the\r\nconcern of an enlightened people that conditions should be so arranged as\r\nto make life more worthwhile.\r\n\r\nWe must devote ourselves to finding answers to these anxieties and\r\naspirations. We seek answers which will embody the moral and spiritual\r\nelements of tolerance, unselfishness, and brotherhood upon which true\r\nfreedom and opportunity must rest.\r\n\r\nAs we examine the state of our Union today, we can benefit from viewing it\r\non a basis of the accomplishments of the last decade and of our goals for\r\nthe next. How far have we come during the last 10 years and how far can we\r\ngo in the next 10?\r\n\r\nIt was 10 years ago that the determination of dictators to wage war upon\r\nmankind became apparent. The years that followed brought untold death and\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nWe shared in the human suffering of the war, but we were fortunate enough\r\nto escape most of war's destruction. We were able through these 10 years to\r\nexpand the productive strength of our farms and factories.\r\n\r\nMore important, however, is the fact that these years brought us new\r\ncourage, new confidence in the ideals of our free democracy. Our deep\r\nbelief in freedom and justice was reinforced in the crucible of war.\r\n\r\nOn the foundations of our greatly strengthened economy and our renewed\r\nconfidence in democratic values, we can continue to move forward.\r\n\r\nThere are some who look with fear and distrust upon planning for the\r\nfuture. Yet our great national achievements have been attained by those\r\nwith vision. Our Union was formed, our frontiers were pushed back, and our\r\ngreat industries were built by men who looked ahead.\r\n\r\nI propose that we look ahead today toward those goals for the future which\r\nhave the greatest bearing upon the foundations of our democracy and the\r\nhappiness of our people.\r\n\r\nI do so, confident in the thought that with clear objectives and with firm\r\ndetermination, we can, in the next 10 years, build upon the [p.3]\r\naccomplishments of the past decade to achieve a glorious future. Year by\r\nyear, beginning now, we must make a substantial part of this progress.\r\n\r\nOur first goal is to secure fully the essential human rights of our\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nThe United States has always had a deep concern for human rights. Religious\r\nfreedom, free speech, and freedom of thought are cherished realities in our\r\nland. Any denial of human rights is a denial of the basic beliefs of\r\ndemocracy and of our regard for the worth of each individual.\r\n\r\nToday, however, some of our citizens are still denied equal opportunity for\r\neducation, for jobs and economic advancement, and for the expression of\r\ntheir views at the polls. Most serious of all, some are denied equal\r\nprotection under laws. Whether discrimination is based on race, or creed,\r\nor color, or land of origin, it is utterly contrary to American ideals of\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\nThe recent report of the President's Committee on Civil Rights points the\r\nway to corrective action by the Federal Government and by State and local\r\ngovernments. Because of the need for effective Federal action, I shall send\r\na special message to the Congress on this important subject.\r\n\r\nWe should also consider our obligation to assure the fullest possible\r\nmeasure of civil rights to the people of our territories and possessions. I\r\nbelieve that the time has come for Alaska and Hawaii to be admitted to the\r\nUnion as States.\r\n\r\nOur second goal is to protect and develop our human resources.\r\n\r\nThe safeguarding of the rights of our citizens must be accompanied by an\r\nequal regard for their opportunities for development and their protection\r\nfrom economic insecurity. In this Nation the ideals of freedom and equality\r\ncan be given specific meaning in terms of health, education, social\r\nsecurity, and housing.\r\n\r\nOver the past 12 years we have erected a sound framework of social security\r\nlegislation. Many millions of our citizens are now protected against the\r\nloss of income which can come with unemployment, old age, or the death of\r\nwage earners. Yet our system has gaps and inconsistencies; it is only half\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\nWe should now extend unemployment compensation, old age benefits, and\r\nsurvivors' benefits to millions who are not now protected. We should also\r\nraise the level of benefits.\r\n\r\nThe greatest gap in our social security structure is the lack of adequate\r\nprovision for the Nation's health. We are rightly proud of the high\r\nstandards of medical care we know how to provide in the United States. The\r\nfact is, however, that most of our people cannot afford to pay for the care\r\nthey need.\r\n\r\nI have often and strongly urged that this condition demands a national\r\nhealth program. The heart of the program must be a national system of\r\npayment for medical care based on well-tried insurance principles. This\r\ngreat Nation cannot afford to allow its citizens to suffer needlessly from\r\nthe lack of proper medical care.\r\n\r\nOur ultimate aim must be a comprehensive insurance system to protect all\r\nour people equally against insecurity and ill health.\r\n\r\nAnother fundamental aim of our democracy is to provide an adequate\r\neducation for every person.\r\n\r\nOur educational systems face a financial crisis. It is deplorable that in a\r\nNation as rich as ours there are millions of children who do not have\r\nadequate schoolhouses or enough teachers for a good elementary or secondary\r\neducation. If there are educational inadequacies in any State, the whole\r\nNation suffers. The Federal Government has a responsibility for providing\r\nfinancial aid to meet this crisis.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we must make possible greater equality of opportunity to all\r\nour citizens for education. Only by so doing can we insure that our\r\ncitizens will be capable of understanding and sharing the responsibilities\r\nof democracy.\r\n\r\nThe Government's programs for health, education, and security are of such\r\ngreat importance to our democracy that we should now establish an executive\r\ndepartment for their administration.\r\n\r\nHealth and education have their beginning in the home. No matter what our\r\nhospitals or schools are like, the youth of our Nation are handicapped when\r\nmillions of them live in city slums and country shacks. Within the next\r\ndecade, we must see that every American family has a decent home. As an\r\nimmediate step we need the long-range housing program which I have\r\nrecommended on many occasions to this Congress. This should include\r\nfinancial aids designed to yield more housing at lower prices. It should\r\nprovide public housing for low-income families, and vigorous development of\r\nnew techniques to lower the cost of building.\r\n\r\nUntil we can overcome the present drastic housing shortage, we must extend\r\nand strengthen rent control.\r\n\r\nWe have had, and shall continue to have, a special interest in the welfare\r\nof our veterans. Over 14 million men and women who served in the armed\r\nforces in World War II have now returned to civilian life. Over 2 million\r\nveterans are being helped through school. Millions have been aided while\r\nfinding jobs, and have been helped in buying homes, in obtaining medical\r\ncare, and in adjusting themselves to physical handicaps.\r\n\r\nAll but a very few veterans have successfully made the transition from\r\nmilitary life to their home communities. The success of our veterans'\r\nprogram is proved by this fact. This Nation is proud of the eagerness shown\r\nby our veterans to become self-reliant and self-supporting citizens.\r\n\r\nOur third goal is to conserve and use our natural resources so that they\r\ncan contribute most effectively to the welfare of our people.\r\n\r\nThe resources given by nature to this country are rich and extensive. The\r\nmaterial foundations of our growth and economic development are the bounty\r\nof our fields, the wealth of our mines and forests, and the energy of our\r\nwaters. As a Nation, we are coming to appreciate more each day the dose\r\nrelationship between the conservation of these resources and the\r\npreservation of our national strength.\r\n\r\nWe are doing far less than we know how to do to make use of our resources\r\nwithout destroying them. Both the public and private use of these resources\r\nmust have the primary objective of maintaining and increasing these basic\r\nsupports for an expanding future.\r\n\r\nWe must continue to take specific steps toward this goal. We must\r\nvigorously defend our natural wealth against those who would misuse it for\r\nselfish gain.\r\n\r\nWe need accurate and comprehensive knowledge of our mineral resources and\r\nmust intensify our efforts to develop new supplies and to acquire\r\nstockpiles of scarce materials.\r\n\r\nWe need to protect and restore our land-public and private--through\r\ncombating erosion and rebuilding the fertility of the soil.\r\n\r\nWe must expand our reclamation program to bring millions of acres of arid\r\nland into production, and to improve water supplies for additional millions\r\nof acres. This will provide new opportunities for veterans and others,\r\nparticularly in the West, and aid in providing a rising living standard for\r\na growing population.\r\n\r\nWe must protect and restore our forests by sustained-yield forestry and by\r\nplanting [p.5] new trees in areas now slashed and barren.\r\n\r\nWe must continue to erect multiple-purpose dams on our great rivers--not\r\nonly to reclaim land, but also to prevent floods, to extend our inland\r\nwaterways and to provide hydroelectric power. This public power must not be\r\nmonopolized for private gain. Only through well-established policies of\r\ntransmitting power directly to its market and thus encouraging widespread\r\nuse at low rates can the Federal Government assure the people of their full\r\nshare of its benefits. Additional power--public and private--is needed to\r\nraise the ceilings now imposed by power shortages on industrial and\r\nagricultural development.\r\n\r\nWe should achieve the wise use of resources through the integrated\r\ndevelopment of our great river basins. We can learn much from our Tennessee\r\nValley experience. We should no longer delay in applying the lessons of\r\nthat vast undertaking to our other great river basins.\r\n\r\nOur fourth goal is to lift the standard of living for all our people by\r\nstrengthening our economic system and sharing more broadly among our people\r\nthe goods we produce.\r\n\r\nThe amazing economic progress of the past 10 years points the way for the\r\nnext 10.\r\n\r\nToday 14 million more people have jobs than in 1938.\r\n\r\nOur yearly output of goods and services has increased by two-thirds.\r\n\r\nThe average income of our people, measured in dollars of equal purchasing\r\npower, has increased--after taxes--by more than 50 percent.\r\n\r\nIn no other 10 years have farmers, businessmen, and wage earners made such\r\ngreat gains.\r\n\r\nWe may not be able to expand as rapidly in the next decade as in the last,\r\nbecause we are now starting from full employment and very high production.\r\nBut we can increase our annual output by at least one-third above the\r\npresent level. We can lift our standard of living to nearly double what it\r\nwas 10 years ago.\r\n\r\nIf we distribute these gains properly, we can go far toward stamping out\r\npoverty in our generation.\r\n\r\nTo do this, agriculture, business, and labor must move forward together.\r\n\r\nPermanent farm prosperity and agricultural abundance will be achieved only\r\nas our whole economy grows and prospers. The farmer can sell more food at\r\ngood prices when the incomes of wage earners are high and when there is\r\nfull employment. Adequate diets for every American family, and the needs of\r\nour industries at full production, will absorb a farm output well above our\r\npresent levels.\r\n\r\nAlthough the average farmer is now better off than ever before, farm\r\nfamilies as a whole have only begun to catch up with the standards of\r\nliving enjoyed in the cities. In 1946, the average income of farm people\r\nwas $779, contrasted with an average income of $1,288 for nonfarm people.\r\nWithin the next decade, we should eliminate elements of inequality in these\r\nliving standards.\r\n\r\nTo this end our farm program should enable the farmer to market his varied\r\ncrops at fair price levels and to improve his standard of living.\r\n\r\nWe need to continue price supports for major farm commodities on a basis\r\nwhich will afford reasonable protection against fluctuations in the levels\r\nof production and demand. The present price support program must be\r\nreexamined and modernized.\r\n\r\nCrop insurance should be strengthened and its benefits extended in order to\r\nprotect the farmer against the special hazards to which he is subject.\r\n\r\nWe also need to improve the means for getting farm products into markets\r\nand into the hands of consumers. Cooperatives which [p.6] directly or\r\nindirectly serve this purpose must be encouraged--not discouraged. The\r\nschool lunch program should be continued and adequately financed.\r\n\r\nWe need to go forward with the rural electrification program to bring the\r\nbenefits of electricity to all our farm population.\r\n\r\nWe can, and must, aid and encourage farmers to conserve their soil\r\nresources and restore the fertility of the land that has suffered from\r\nneglect or unwise use.\r\n\r\nAll these are practical measures upon which we should act immediately to\r\nenable agriculture to make its full contribution to our prosperity.\r\n\r\nWe must also strengthen our economic system within the next decade by\r\nenlarging our industrial capacity within the framework of our free\r\nenterprise system.\r\n\r\nWe are today far short of the industrial capacity we need for a growing\r\nfuture. At least $50 billion should be invested by industry to improve and\r\nexpand our productive facilities over the next few years. But this is only\r\nthe beginning. The industrial application of atomic energy and other\r\nscientific advances will constantly open up further opportunities for\r\nexpansion. Farm prosperity and high employment will call for an immensely\r\nincreased output of goods and services.\r\n\r\nGrowth and vitality in our economy depend on vigorous private enterprise.\r\nFree competition is the key to industrial development, full production and\r\nemployment, fair prices, and an ever improving standard of living.\r\nCompetition is seriously limited today in many industries by the\r\nconcentration of economic power and other elements of monopoly. The\r\nappropriation of sufficient funds to permit proper enforcement of the\r\npresent antitrust laws is essential. Beyond that we should go on to\r\nstrengthen our legislation to protect competition.\r\n\r\nAnother basic element of a strong economic system is the well-being of the\r\nwage earners.\r\n\r\nWe have learned that the well-being of workers depends on high production\r\nand consequent high employment. We have learned equally well that the\r\nwelfare of industry and agriculture depends on high incomes for our\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\nThe Government has wisely chosen to set a floor under wages. But our\r\n40-cent minimum wage is inadequate and obsolete. I recommend the lifting of\r\nthe minimum wage to 75 cents an hour.\r\n\r\nIn general, however, we must continue to rely on our sound system of\r\ncollective bargaining to set wage scales. Workers' incomes should increase\r\nat a rate consistent with the maintenance of sound price, profit, and wage\r\nrelationships and with increase of productivity.\r\n\r\nThe Government's part in labor-management relations is now largely\r\ncontrolled by the terms of the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947. I\r\nmade my attitude clear on this act in my veto message to the Congress last\r\nJune. Nothing has occurred since to change my opinion of this law. As long\r\nas it remains the law of the land, however, I shall carry out my\r\nconstitutional duty and administer it.\r\n\r\nAs we look ahead we can understand the crucial importance of restraint and\r\nwisdom in arriving at new labor-management contracts. Work stoppages would\r\nresult in a loss of production--a loss which could bring higher prices for\r\nour citizens and could also deny the necessities of life to the\r\nhard-pressed peoples of other lands. It is my sincere hope that the\r\nrepresentatives of labor and of industry will bear in mind that the Nation\r\nas a whole has a vital stake in the success of their bargaining efforts.\r\n\r\nIf we surmount our current economic difficulties, we can move ahead to a\r\ngreat increase [p.7] in our national income which will enable all our\r\npeople to enjoy richer and fuller lives.\r\n\r\nAll of us must advance together. One-fifth of our families now have average\r\nannual incomes of less than $850. We must see that our gains in national\r\nincome are made more largely available to those with low incomes, whose\r\nneed is greatest. This will benefit us all through providing a stable\r\nfoundation of buying power to maintain prosperity.\r\n\r\nBusiness, labor, agriculture, and Government, working together, must\r\ndevelop the policies which will make possible the realization of the full\r\nbenefits of our economic system.\r\n\r\nOur fifth goal is to achieve world peace based on principles of freedom and\r\njustice and the equality of all nations.\r\n\r\nTwice within our generation, world wars have taught us that we cannot\r\nisolate ourselves from the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nWe have learned that the loss of freedom in any area of the world means a\r\nloss of freedom to ourselves--that the loss of independence by any nation\r\nadds directly to the insecurity of the United States and all free nations.\r\n\r\nWe have learned that a healthy world economy is essential to world\r\npeace--that economic distress is a disease whose evil effects spread far\r\nbeyond the boundaries of the afflicted nation.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons the United States is vigorously following policies\r\ndesigned to achieve a peaceful and prosperous world.\r\n\r\nWe are giving, and will continue to give, our full support to the United\r\nNations. While that organization has encountered unforeseen and unwelcome\r\ndifficulties, I am confident of its ultimate success. We are also devoting\r\nour efforts toward world economic recovery and the revival of world trade.\r\nThese actions are closely related and mutually supporting.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the United States can be an effective force for world peace\r\nonly if it is strong. We look forward to the day when nations will decrease\r\ntheir armaments. Yet so long as there remains serious opposition to the\r\nideals of a peaceful world, we must maintain strong armed forces.\r\n\r\nThe passage of the National Security Act by the Congress at its last\r\nsession was a notable step in providing for the security of this country. A\r\nfurther step which I consider of even greater importance is the early\r\nprovision for universal training. There are many elements in a balanced\r\nnational security program, all interrelated and necessary, but universal\r\ntraining should be the foundation for them all. A favorable decision by the\r\nCongress at an early date is of world importance. I am convinced that such\r\naction is vital to the security of this Nation and to the maintenance of\r\nits leadership.\r\n\r\nThe United States is engaged today in many international activities\r\ndirected toward the creation of lasting peaceful relationships among\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nWe have been giving substantial aid to Greece and Turkey to assist those\r\nnations in preserving their integrity against foreign pressures. Had it not\r\nbeen for our aid, their situation today might well be radically different.\r\nThe continued integrity of those countries will have a powerful effect upon\r\nother nations in the Middle East and in Europe struggling to maintain their\r\nindependence while they repair the damages of war.\r\n\r\nThe United States has special responsibilities with respect to the\r\ncountries in which we have occupation forces: Germany, Austria, Japan, and\r\nKorea. Our efforts to reach agreements on peace settlements for these\r\ncountries have so far been blocked. But we [p.8] shall continue to exert\r\nour utmost efforts to obtain satisfactory settlements for each of these\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nMany thousands of displaced persons, still living in camps overseas, should\r\nbe allowed entry into the United States. I again urge the Congress to pass\r\nsuitable legislation at once so that this Nation may do its share in caring\r\nfor the homeless and suffering refugees of all faiths. I believe that the\r\nadmission of these persons will add to the strength and energy of this\r\nNation.\r\n\r\nWe are moving toward our goal of world peace in many ways. But the most\r\nimportant efforts which we are now making are those which support world\r\neconomic reconstruction. We are seeking to restore the world trading system\r\nwhich was shattered by the war and to remedy the economic paralysis which\r\ngrips many countries.\r\n\r\nTo restore world trade we have recently taken the lead in bringing about\r\nthe greatest reduction of world tariffs that the world has ever seen. The\r\nextension of the provisions of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, which\r\nmade this achievement possible, is of extreme importance. We must also go\r\non to support the International Trade Organization, through which we hope\r\nto obtain worldwide agreement on a code of fair conduct in international\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nOur present major effort toward economic reconstruction is to support the\r\nprogram for recovery developed by the countries of Europe. In my recent\r\nmessage to the Congress, I outlined the reasons why it is wise and\r\nnecessary for the United States to extend this support.\r\n\r\nI want to reaffirm my belief in the soundness and the promise of this\r\nproposal. When the European economy is strengthened, the product of its\r\nindustry will be of benefit to many other areas of economic distress. The\r\nability of free men to overcome hunger and despair will be a moral stimulus\r\nto the entire world.\r\n\r\nWe intend to work also with other nations in achieving world economic\r\nrecovery. We shall continue our cooperation with the nations of the Western\r\nHemisphere. A special program of assistance to China, to provide urgent\r\nrelief needs and to speed reconstruction, will be submitted to the\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, not all governments share the hope of the people of the\r\nUnited States that economic reconstruction in many areas of the world can\r\nbe achieved through cooperative effort among nations. In spite of these\r\ndifferences we will go forward with our efforts to overcome economic\r\nparalysis.\r\n\r\nNo nation by itself can carry these programs to success; they depend upon\r\nthe cooperative and honest efforts of all participating countries. Yet the\r\nleadership is inevitably ours.\r\n\r\nI consider it of the highest importance that the Congress should authorize\r\nsupport for the European recovery program for the period from April 1,\r\n1948, to June 30, 1952, with an initial amount for the first 15 months of\r\n$6.8 billion. I urge the Congress to act promptly on this vital measure of\r\nour foreign policy--on this decisive contribution to world peace.\r\n\r\nWe are following a sound, constructive, and practical course in carrying\r\nout our determination to achieve peace.\r\n\r\nWe are fighting poverty, hunger, and suffering.\r\n\r\nThis leads to peace--not war.\r\n\r\nWe are building toward a world where all nations, large and small alike,\r\nmay live free from the fear of aggression. This leads to peace--not war.\r\n\r\nAbove all else, we are striving to achieve a concord among the peoples of\r\nthe world based upon the dignity of the individual and the brotherhood of\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThis leads to peace--not war.\r\n\r\nWe can go forward with confidence that we are following sound policies,\r\nboth at home and with other nations, which will lead us toward our great\r\ngoals for economic, social and moral achievement.\r\n\r\nAs we enter the new year, we must surmount one major problem which affects\r\nall our goals. That is the problem of inflation.\r\n\r\nAlready inflation in this country is undermining the living standards of\r\nmillions of families. Food costs too much. Housing has reached fantastic\r\nprice levels. Schools and hospitals are in financial distress. Inflation\r\nthreatens to bring on disagreement and strife between labor and\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\nWorst of all, inflation holds the threat of another depression, just as we\r\nhad a depression after the unstable boom following the First World War.\r\n\r\nWhen I announced last October that the Congress was being called into\r\nsession, I described the price increases which had taken place since June\r\n1946. Wholesale prices had increased 40 percent; retail prices had\r\nincreased 23 percent.\r\n\r\nSince October prices have continued to rise. Wholesale prices have gone up\r\nat an annual rate of 18 percent. Retail prices have gone up at an annual\r\nrate of 10 percent.\r\n\r\nThe events which have occurred since I presented my 10-point anti-inflation\r\nprogram to the Congress in November have made it even clearer that all 10\r\npoints are essential.\r\n\r\nHigh prices must not be our means of rationing.\r\n\r\nWe must deal effectively and at once with the high cost of living.\r\n\r\nWe must stop the spiral of inflation.\r\n\r\nI trust that within the shortest possible time the Congress will make\r\navailable to the Government the weapons that are so desperately needed in\r\nthe fight against inflation.\r\n\r\nOne of the most powerful anti-inflationary factors in our economy today is\r\nthe excess of Government revenues over expenditures.\r\n\r\nGovernment expenditures have been and must continue to be held at the\r\nlowest safe levels. Since V-J day Federal expenditures have been sharply\r\nreduced. They have been cut from more than $63 billion in the fiscal year\r\n1946 to less than $38 billion in the present fiscal year. The number of\r\ncivilian employees has been cut nearly in half--from 3 3/4 million down to\r\n2 million.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Government revenues must not be reduced. Until inflation\r\nhas been stopped there should be no cut in taxes that is not offset by\r\nadditions at another point in our tax structure.\r\n\r\nCertain adjustments should be made within our existing tax structure that\r\nwill not affect total receipts, yet will adjust the tax burden so that\r\nthose least able to pay will have their burden lessened by the transfer of\r\na portion of it to those best able to pay.\r\n\r\nMany of our families today are suffering hardship because of the high cost\r\nof living. At the same time profits of corporations have reached an\r\nall-time record in 1947. Corporate profits total $17 billion after taxes.\r\nThis compared with $12.5 billion in 1946, the previous high year.\r\n\r\nBecause of this extraordinarily high level of profits, corporations can\r\nwell afford to carry a larger share of the taxload at this time.\r\n\r\nDuring this period in which the high cost of living is bearing down on so\r\nmany of our families, tax adjustments should be made to ease their burden.\r\nThe low-income group particularly is being pressed very hard. To this group\r\na tax adjustment would result in a saving that could be used to buy the\r\nnecessities of life.\r\n\r\nI recommend therefore that, effective January 1, 1948, a cost of living tax\r\ncredit be extended to our people consisting of a credit of $40 to each\r\nindividual taxpayer and an additional credit of $40 for each dependent.\r\n[p.10] Thus the income tax of a man with a wife and two children would be\r\nreduced $160. The credit would be extended to all taxpayers, but it would\r\nbe particularly helpful to those in the low-income group.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that such a tax credit would reduce Federal revenue by $3.2\r\nbillion. This reduction should be made up by increasing the tax on\r\ncorporate profits in an amount that will produce this sum--with appropriate\r\nadjustments for small corporations.\r\n\r\nThis is the proper method of tax relief at this time. It gives relief to\r\nthose who need it most without cutting the total tax revenue of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nWhen the present danger of inflation has passed we should consider tax\r\nreduction based upon a revision of our entire tax structure.\r\n\r\nWhen we have conquered inflation, we shall be in a position to move forward\r\ntoward our chosen goals.\r\n\r\nAs we do so, let us keep ever before us our high purposes. We are\r\ndetermined that every citizen of this Nation shall have an equal right and\r\nan equal opportunity to grow in wisdom and in stature and to take his place\r\nin the control of his Nation's destiny.\r\n\r\nWe are determined that the productive resources of this Nation shall be\r\nused wisely and fully for the benefit of all.\r\n\r\nWe are determined that the democratic faith of our people and the strength\r\nof our resources shall contribute their full share to the attainment of\r\nenduring peace in the world.\r\n\r\nIt is our faith in human dignity that underlies these purposes. It is this\r\nfaith that keeps us a strong and vital people.\r\n\r\nThis is a time to remind ourselves of these fundamentals. For today the\r\nwhole world looks to us for leadership.\r\n\r\nThis is the hour to rededicate ourselves to the faith in mankind that makes\r\nus strong.\r\n\r\nThis is the hour to rededicate ourselves to the faith in God that gives us\r\nconfidence as we face the challenge of the years ahead.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nHarry S. Truman\r\nJanuary 5, 1949\r\n\r\nMr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Congress:\r\n\r\nI am happy to report to this 81st Congress that the state of the Union is\r\ngood. Our Nation is better able than ever before to meet the needs of the\r\nAmerican people, and to give them their fair chance in the pursuit of\r\nhappiness. This great Republic is foremost among the nations of the world\r\nin the search for peace.\r\n\r\nDuring the last 16 years, our people have been creating a society which\r\noffers new opportunities for every man to enjoy his share of the good\r\nthings of life.\r\n\r\nIn this society, we are conservative about the values and principles which\r\nwe cherish; but we are forward-looking in protecting those values and\r\nprinciples and in extending their benefits. We have rejected the\r\ndiscredited theory that the fortunes of the Nation should be in the hands\r\nof a privileged few. We have abandoned the \"trickledown\" concept of\r\nnational prosperity. Instead, we believe that our economic system should\r\nrest on a democratic foundation and that wealth should be created for the\r\nbenefit of all.\r\n\r\nThe recent election shows that the people of the United States are in favor\r\nof this kind of society and want to go on improving it.\r\n\r\nThe American people have decided that poverty is just as wasteful and just\r\nas unnecessary as preventable disease. We have pledged our common resources\r\nto help one another in the hazards and struggles of individual life. We\r\nbelieve that no unfair prejudice or artificial distinction should bar any\r\ncitizen of the United States of America from an education, or from good\r\nhealth, or from a job that he is capable of performing.\r\n\r\nThe attainment of this kind of society demands the best efforts of every\r\ncitizen in every walk of life, and it imposes increasing responsibilities\r\non the Government.\r\n\r\nThe Government must work with industry, labor, and the farmers in keeping\r\nour economy running at full speed. The Government must see that every\r\nAmerican has a chance to obtain his fair share of our increasing abundance.\r\nThese responsibilities go hand in hand.\r\n\r\nWe cannot maintain prosperity unless we have a fair distribution of\r\nopportunity and a widespread consumption of the products of our factories\r\nand farms.\r\n\r\nOur Government has undertaken to meet these responsibilities.\r\n\r\nWe have made tremendous public investments in highways, hydroelectric\r\npower projects, soil conservation, and reclamation. We have established a\r\nsystem of social security. We have enacted laws protecting the rights and\r\nthe welfare of our working people and the income of our farmers. These\r\nFederal policies have paid for themselves many times over. They have\r\nstrengthened the material foundations of our democratic ideals. Without\r\nthem, our present prosperity would be impossible.\r\n\r\nReinforced by these policies, our private enterprise system has reached new\r\nheights of production. Since the boom year of 1929, while our population\r\nhas increased by only 20 percent, our agricultural production has increased\r\nby 45 percent, and our industrial production has increased by 75 percent.\r\nWe are turning out far more goods and more wealth per worker than we have\r\never done before.\r\n\r\nThis progress has confounded the gloomy prophets--at home and abroad who\r\npredicted the downfall of American capitalism. The people of the United\r\nStates, going their own way, confident in their own powers, have achieved\r\nthe greatest prosperity the world has even seen.\r\n\r\nBut, great as our progress has been, we still have a long way to go.\r\n\r\nAs we look around the country, many of our shortcomings stand out in bold\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nWe are suffering from excessively high prices.\r\n\r\nOur production is still not large enough to satisfy our demands.\r\n\r\nOur minimum wages are far too low.\r\n\r\nSmall business is losing ground to growing monopoly.\r\n\r\nOur farmers still face an uncertain future. And too many of them lack the\r\nbenefits of our modern civilization.\r\n\r\nSome of our natural resources are still being wasted.\r\n\r\nWe are acutely short of electric power, although the means for developing\r\nsuch power are abundant.\r\n\r\nFive million families are still living in slums and firetraps. Three\r\nmillion families share their homes with others.\r\n\r\nOur health is far behind the progress of medical science. Proper medical\r\ncare is so expensive that it is out of the reach of the great majority of\r\nour citizens.\r\n\r\nOur schools, in many localities, are utterly inadequate.\r\n\r\nOur democratic ideals are often thwarted by prejudice and intolerance.\r\n\r\nEach of these shortcomings is also an opportunity-an opportunity for the\r\nCongress and the President to work for the good of the people.\r\n\r\nOur first great opportunity is to protect our economy against the evils of\r\n\"boom and bust.\"\r\n\r\nThis objective cannot be attained by government alone. Indeed, the greater\r\npart of the task must be performed by individual efforts under our system\r\nof free enterprise. We can keep our present prosperity, and increase it,\r\nonly if free enterprise and free government work together to that end.\r\n\r\nWe cannot afford to float along ceaselessly on a postwar boom until it\r\ncollapses. It is not enough merely to prepare to weather a recession if it\r\ncomes. Instead, government and business must work together constantly to\r\nachieve more and more jobs and more and more production--which mean more\r\nand more prosperity for all the people.\r\n\r\nThe business cycle is man-made; and men of good will, working together, can\r\nsmooth it out.\r\n\r\nSo far as business is concerned, it should plan for steady, vigorous\r\nexpansion--seeking always to increase its output, lower its prices, and\r\navoid the vices of monopoly and restriction. So long as business does this,\r\nit will be contributing to continued prosperity, and it will have the help\r\nand encouragement of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe Employment Act of 1946 pledges the Government to use all its resources\r\nto promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power. This means\r\nthat the Government is firmly committed to protect business and the people\r\nagainst the dangers of recession and against the evils of inflation. This\r\nmeans that the Government must adapt its plans and policies to meet\r\nchanging circumstances.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, our prosperity is threatened by inflationary pressures\r\nat a number of critical points in our economy. And the Government must be\r\nin a position to take effective action at these danger spots. To that end,\r\nI recommend that the Congress enact legislation for the following\r\npurposes:\r\n\r\nFirst, to continue the power to control consumer credit and enlarge the\r\npower to control bank credit.\r\n\r\nSecond, to grant authority to regulate speculation on the commodity\r\nexchanges.\r\n\r\nThird, to continue export control authority and to provide adequate\r\nmachinery for its enforcement.\r\n\r\nFourth, to continue the priorities and allocation authority in the field of\r\ntransportation.\r\n\r\nFifth, to authorize priorities and allocations for key materials in short\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\nSixth, to extend and strengthen rent control.\r\n\r\nSeventh, to provide standby authority to impose price ceilings for scarce\r\ncommodities which basically affect essential industrial production or the\r\ncost of living, and to limit unjustified wage adjustments which would force\r\na break in an established price ceiling.\r\n\r\nEighth, to authorize an immediate study of the adequacy of production\r\nfacilities for materials in critically short supply, such as steel; and, if\r\nfound necessary, to authorize Government loans for the expansion of\r\nproduction facilities to relieve such shortages, and to authorize the\r\nconstruction of such facilities directly, if action by private industry\r\nfails to meet our needs.\r\n\r\nThe Economic Report, which I shall submit to the Congress shortly, will\r\ndiscuss in detail the economic background for these recommendations.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important factors in maintaining prosperity is the\r\nGovernment's fiscal policy. At this time, it is essential not only that the\r\nFederal budget be balanced, but also that there be a substantial surplus to\r\nreduce inflationary pressures, and to permit a sizable reduction in the\r\nnational debt, which now stands at $252 billion. I recommend, therefore,\r\nthat the Congress enact new tax legislation to bring in an additional $4\r\nbillion of Government revenue. This should come principally from additional\r\ncorporate taxes. A portion should come from revised estate and gift taxes.\r\nConsideration should be given to raising personal income rates in the\r\nmiddle and upper brackets.\r\n\r\nIf we want to keep our economy running in high gear, we must be sure that\r\nevery group has the incentive to make its full contribution to the national\r\nwelfare. At present, the working men and women of the Nation are unfairly\r\ndiscriminated against by a statute that abridges their rights, curtails\r\ntheir constructive efforts, and hampers our system of free collective\r\nbargaining. That statute is the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947,\r\nsometimes called the Taft-Hartley Act.\r\n\r\nThat act should be repealed!\r\n\r\nThe Wagner Act should be reenacted. However, certain improvements, which I\r\nrecommended to the Congress 2 years ago, are needed. Jurisdictional strikes\r\nand unjustified secondary boycotts should be prohibited. The use of\r\neconomic force to decide issues arising out of the interpretation of\r\nexisting contracts should be prevented. Without endangering our democratic\r\nfreedoms, means should be provided for setting up machinery for preventing\r\nstrikes in vital industries which affect the public interest.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Labor should be rebuilt and strengthened and those units\r\nproperly belonging within that department should be placed in it.\r\n\r\nThe health of our economy and its maintenance at high levels further\r\nrequire that the minimum wage fixed by law should be raised to at least 75\r\ncents an hour.\r\n\r\nIf our free enterprise economy is to be strong and healthy, we must\r\nreinvigorate the forces of competition. We must assure small business the\r\nfreedom and opportunity to grow and prosper. To this purpose, we should\r\nstrengthen our antitrust laws by closing those loopholes that permit\r\nmonopolistic mergers and consolidations.\r\n\r\nOur national farm program should be improved-not only in the interest of\r\nthe farmers, but for the lasting prosperity of the whole Nation. Our goals\r\nshould be abundant farm production and parity income for agriculture.\r\nStandards of living on the farm should be just as good as anywhere else in\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nFarm price supports are an essential part of our program to achieve these\r\nends. Price supports should be used to prevent farm price declines which\r\nare out of line with general price levels, to facilitate adjustments in\r\nproduction to consumer demands, and to promote good land use. Our price\r\nsupport legislation must be adapted to these objectives. The authority of\r\nthe Commodity Credit Corporation to provide adequate storage space for\r\ncrops should be restored.\r\n\r\nOur program for farm prosperity should also seek to expand the domestic\r\nmarket for agricultural products, particularly among low-income groups, and\r\nto increase and stabilize foreign markets.\r\n\r\nWe should give special attention to extending modern conveniences and\r\nservices to our farms. Rural electrification should be pushed forward. And\r\nin considering legislation relating to housing, education, health, and\r\nsocial security, special attention should be given to rural problems.\r\n\r\nOur growing population and the expansion of our economy depend upon the\r\nwise management of our land, water, forest, and mineral wealth. In our\r\npresent dynamic economy, the task of conservation is not to lockup our\r\nresources but to develop and improve them. Failure, today, to make the\r\ninvestments which are necessary to support our progress in the future would\r\nbe false economy.\r\n\r\nWe must push forward the development of our rivers for power, irrigation,\r\nnavigation, and flood control. We should apply the lessons of our Tennessee\r\nValley experience to our other great river basins.\r\n\r\nI again recommend action be taken by the Congress to approve the St.\r\nLawrence Seaway and Power project. This is about the fifth time I have\r\nrecommended it.\r\n\r\nWe must adopt a program for the planned use of the petroleum reserves under\r\nthe sea, which are--and must remain--vested in the Federal Government. We\r\nmust extend our programs of soil conservation. We must place our forests on\r\na sustained yield basis, and encourage the development of new sources of\r\nvital minerals.\r\n\r\nIn all this we must make sure that the benefits of these public\r\nundertakings are directly available to the people. Public power should be\r\ncarried to consuming areas by public transmission lines where necessary to\r\nprovide electricity at the lowest possible rates. Irrigation waters should\r\nserve family farms and not land speculators.\r\n\r\nThe Government has still other opportunities--to help raise the standard of\r\nliving of our citizens. These opportunities lie in the fields of social\r\nsecurity, health, education, housing, and civil rights.\r\n\r\nThe present coverage of the social security laws is altogether inadequate;\r\nthe benefit payments are too low. One-third of our workers are not covered.\r\nThose who receive old-age and survivors insurance benefits receive an\r\naverage payment of only $25 a month. Many others who cannot work because\r\nthey are physically disabled are left to the mercy of charity. We should\r\nexpand our social security program, both as to the size of the benefits and\r\nthe extent of coverage, against the economic hazards due to unemployment,\r\nold age, sickness, and disability.\r\n\r\nWe must spare no effort to raise the general level of health in this\r\ncountry. In a nation as rich as ours, it is a shocking fact that tens of\r\nmillions lack adequate medical care. We are short of doctors, hospitals,\r\nnurses. We must remedy these shortages. Moreover, we need--and we must have\r\nwithout further delay--a system of prepaid medical insurance which will\r\nenable every American to afford good medical care.\r\n\r\nIt is equally shocking that millions of our children are not receiving a\r\ngood education. Millions of them are in overcrowded, obsolete buildings. We\r\nare short of teachers, because teachers' salaries are too low to attract\r\nnew teachers, or to hold the ones we have. All these school problems will\r\nbecome much more acute as a result of the tremendous increase in the\r\nenrollment in our elementary schools in the next few years. I cannot repeat\r\ntoo strongly my desire for prompt Federal financial aid to the States to\r\nhelp them operate and maintain their school systems.\r\n\r\nThe governmental agency which now administers the programs of health,\r\neducation, and social security should be given full departmental status.\r\n\r\nThe housing shortage continues to be acute. As an immediate step, the\r\nCongress should enact the provisions for low-rent public housing, slum\r\nclearance, farm housing, and housing research which I have repeatedly\r\nrecommended. The number of low-rent public housing units provided for in the\r\nlegislation should be increased to 1 million units in the next 7 years.\r\nEven this number of units will not begin to meet our need for new housing.\r\n\r\nMost of the houses we need will have to be built by private enterprise,\r\nwithout public subsidy. By producing too few rental units and too large a\r\nproportion of high-priced houses, the building industry is rapidly pricing\r\nitself out of the market. Building costs must be lowered.\r\n\r\nThe Government is now engaged in a campaign to induce all segments of the\r\nbuilding industry to concentrate on the production of lower priced housing.\r\nAdditional legislation to encourage such housing will be submitted.\r\n\r\nThe authority which I have requested, to allocate materials in short supply\r\nand to impose price ceilings on such materials, could be used, if found\r\nnecessary, to channel more materials into homes large enough for family\r\nlife at prices which wage earners can afford.\r\n\r\nThe driving force behind our progress is our faith in our democratic\r\ninstitutions. That faith is embodied in the promise of equal rights and\r\nequal opportunities which the founders of our Republic proclaimed to their\r\ncountrymen and to the whole world.\r\n\r\nThe fulfillment of this promise is among the highest purposes of\r\ngovernment. The civil rights proposals I made to the 80th Congress, I now\r\nrepeat to the 81st Congress. They should be enacted in order that the\r\nFederal Government may assume the leadership and discharge the obligations\r\ndearly placed upon it by the Constitution.\r\n\r\nI stand squarely behind those proposals.\r\n\r\nOur domestic programs are the foundation of our foreign policy. The world\r\ntoday looks to us for leadership because we have so largely realized,\r\nwithin our borders, those benefits of democratic government for which most\r\nof the peoples of the world are yearning.\r\n\r\nWe are following a foreign policy which is the outward expression of the\r\ndemocratic faith we profess. We are doing what we can to encourage free\r\nstates and free peoples throughout the world, to aid the suffering and\r\nafflicted in foreign lands, and to strengthen democratic nations against\r\naggression.\r\n\r\nThe heart of our foreign policy is peace. We are supporting a world\r\norganization to keep peace and a world economic policy to create prosperity\r\nfor mankind. Our guiding star is the principle of international\r\ncooperation. To this concept we have made a national commitment as profound\r\nas anything in history.\r\n\r\nTo it we have pledged our resources and our honor.\r\n\r\nUntil a system of world security is established upon which we can safely\r\nrely, we cannot escape the burden of creating and maintaining armed forces\r\nsufficient to deter aggression. We have made great progress in the last\r\nyear in the effective organization of our Armed Forces, but further\r\nimprovements in our national security legislation are necessary. Universal\r\ntraining is essential to the security of the United States.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of this session I shall have occasion to ask the Congress\r\nto consider several measures in the field of foreign policy. At this time,\r\nI recommend that we restore the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act to full\r\neffectiveness, and extend it for 3 years. We should also open our doors to\r\ndisplaced persons without unfair discrimination.\r\n\r\nIt should be clear by now to all citizens that we are not seeking to freeze\r\nthe status quo. We have no intention of preserving the injustices of the\r\npast. We welcome the constructive efforts being made by many nations to\r\nachieve a better life for their citizens. In the European recovery program,\r\nin our good-neighbor policy and in the United Nations, we have begun to\r\nbatter down those national walls which block the economic growth and the\r\nsocial advancement of the peoples of the world.\r\n\r\nWe believe that if we hold resolutely to this course, the principle of\r\ninternational cooperation will eventually command the approval even of\r\nthose nations which are now seeking to weaken or subvert it.\r\n\r\nWe stand at the opening of an era which can mean either great achievement\r\nor terrible catastrophe for ourselves and for all mankind.\r\n\r\nThe strength of our Nation must continue to be used in the interest of all\r\nour people rather than a privileged few. It must continue to be used\r\nunselfishly in the struggle for world peace and the betterment of mankind\r\nthe world over.\r\n\r\nThis is the task before us.\r\n\r\nIt is not an easy one. It has many complications, and there will be strong\r\nopposition from selfish interests.\r\n\r\nI hope for cooperation from farmers, from labor, and from business. Every\r\nsegment of our population and every individual has a right to expect from\r\nour Government a fair deal.\r\n\r\nIn 1945, when I came down before the Congress for the first time on April\r\n16, I quoted to you King Solomon's prayer that he wanted wisdom and the\r\nability to govern his people as they should be governed. I explained to you\r\nat that time that the task before me was one of the greatest in the history\r\nof the world, and that it was necessary to have the complete cooperation of\r\nthe Congress and the people of the United States.\r\n\r\nWell now, we are taking a new start with the same situation. It is\r\nabsolutely essential that your President have the complete cooperation of\r\nthe Congress to carry out the great work that must be done to keep the\r\npeace in this world, and to keep this country prosperous.\r\n\r\nThe people of this great country have a right to expect that the Congress\r\nand the President will work in closest cooperation with one objective--the\r\nwelfare of the people of this Nation as a whole.\r\n\r\nIn the months ahead I know that I shall be able to cooperate with this\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nNow, I am confident that the Divine Power which has guided us to this time\r\nof fateful responsibility and glorious opportunity will not desert us now.\r\n\r\nWith that help from Almighty God which we have humbly acknowledged at every\r\nturning point in our national life, we shall be able to perform the great\r\ntasks which He now sets before us.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nHarry S. Truman\r\nJanuary 4, 1950\r\n\r\nMr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Congress:\r\n\r\nA year ago I reported to this Congress that the state of the Union was\r\ngood. I am happy to be able to report to you today that the state of the\r\nUnion continues to be good. Our Republic continues to increase in the\r\nenjoyment of freedom within its borders, and to offer strength and\r\nencouragement to all those who love freedom throughout the world.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year we have made notable progress in strengthening the\r\nfoundations of peace and freedom, abroad and at home.\r\n\r\nWe have taken important steps in securing the North Atlantic community\r\nagainst aggression. We have continued our successful support of European\r\nrecovery. We have returned to our established policy of expanding\r\ninternational trade through reciprocal agreement. We have strengthened our\r\nsupport of the United Nations.\r\n\r\nWhile great problems still confront us, the greatest danger has\r\nreceded--the possibility which faced us 3 years ago that most of Europe and\r\nthe Mediterranean area might collapse under totalitarian pressure. Today,\r\nthe free peoples of the world have new vigor and new hope for the cause of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nIn our domestic affairs, we have made notable advances toward broader\r\nopportunity and a better life for all our citizens.\r\n\r\nWe have met and reversed the first significant downturn in economic\r\nactivity since the war. In accomplishing this, Government programs for\r\nmaintaining employment and purchasing power have been of tremendous\r\nbenefit. As the result of these programs, and the wisdom and good judgment\r\nof our businessmen and workers, major readjustments have been made without\r\nwidespread suffering.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year, we have also made a good start in providing housing\r\nfor low-income groups; we have raised minimum wages; we have gone forward\r\nwith the development of our natural resources; we have given a greater\r\nassurance of stability to the farmer; and we have improved the organization\r\nand efficiency of our Government.\r\n\r\nToday, by the grace of God, we stand a free and prosperous nation with\r\ngreater possibilities for the future than any people ever had before in the\r\nhistory of the world.\r\n\r\nWe are now, in this year of 1950, nearing the midpoint of the 20th\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe first half of this century will be known as the most turbulent and\r\neventful period in recorded history. The swift pace of events promises to\r\nmake the next 50 years decisive in the history of man on this planet.\r\n\r\nThe scientific and industrial revolution which began two centuries ago has,\r\nin the last 50 years, caught up the peoples of the globe in a common\r\ndestiny. Two world-shattering wars have proved that no corner of the earth\r\ncan be isolated from the affairs of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe human race has reached a turning point. Man has opened the secrets of\r\nnature and mastered new powers. If he uses them wisely, he can reach new\r\nheights of civilization. If he uses them foolishly, they may destroy him.\r\n\r\nMan must create the moral and legal framework for the world which will\r\ninsure that his new powers are used for good and not for evil. In shaping\r\nthe outcome, the people of the United States will play a leading role.\r\n\r\nAmong all the great changes that have occurred in the last 50 years, none\r\nis more important than the change in the position of the United States in\r\nworld affairs. Fifty years ago we were a country devoted largely to our own\r\ninternal affairs. Our industry was growing, and we had new interests in the\r\nFar East and in the Caribbean, but we were primarily concerned with the\r\ndevelopment of vast areas of our own continental territory.\r\n\r\nToday, our population has doubled. Our national production has risen from\r\nabout $50 billion, in terms of today's prices, to the staggering figure of\r\n$255 billion a year. We have a more productive economic system and a\r\ngreater industrial potential than any other nation on the globe. Our\r\nstandard of living is an inspiration for all other peoples. Even the\r\nslightest changes in our economic and social life have their effect on\r\nother countries all around the world.\r\n\r\nOur tremendous strength has brought with it tremendous responsibilities. We\r\nhave moved from the outer edge to the center of world affairs. Other\r\nnations look to us for a wise exercise of our economic and military\r\nstrength, and for vigorous support of the ideals of representative\r\ngovernment and a free society. We will not fail them.\r\n\r\nOur objective in the world is peace. Our country has joined with others in\r\nthe task of achieving peace. We know now that this is not an easy task, or\r\na short one. But we are determined to see it through. Both of our great\r\npolitical parties are committed to working together--and I am sure they\r\nwill continue to work together--to achieve this end. We are prepared to\r\ndevote our energy and our resources to this task, because we know that our\r\nown security and the future of mankind are at stake.\r\n\r\nRight here, I want to say that no one appreciates more than I the\r\nbipartisan cooperation in foreign affairs which has been enjoyed by this\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nOur success in working with other nations to achieve peace depends largely\r\non what we do at home. We must preserve our national strength. Strength is\r\nnot simply a matter of arms and force. It is a matter of economic growth,\r\nand social health, and vigorous institutions, public and private. We can\r\nachieve peace only if we maintain our productive energy, our democratic\r\ninstitutions, and our firm belief in individual freedom.\r\n\r\nOur surest guide in the days that lie ahead will be the spirit in which\r\nthis great Republic was rounded. We must make our decisions in the\r\nconviction that all men are created equal, that they are equally entitled\r\nto life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and that the duty of\r\ngovernment is to serve these ends.\r\n\r\nThis country of ours has experienced many blessings, but none greater than\r\nits dedication to these principles. At every point in our history, these\r\nideals have served to correct our failures and shortcomings, to spur us on\r\nto greater efforts, and to keep clearly before us the primary purpose of\r\nour existence as a nation. They have enshrined for us, a principle of\r\ngovernment, the moral imperative to do justice, and the divine command to\r\nmen to love one another.\r\n\r\nThese principles give meaning to all that we do.\r\n\r\nIn foreign policy, they mean that we can never be tolerant of oppression or\r\ntyranny. They mean that we must throw our weight on the side of greater\r\nfreedom and a better life for all peoples. These principles confirm us in\r\ncarrying out the specific programs for peace which we have already begun.\r\n\r\nWe shall continue to give our wholehearted support to the United Nations.\r\nWe believe that this organization can ultimately provide the framework of\r\ninternational law and morality without which mankind cannot survive. It has\r\nalready set up new standards for the conduct of nations in the Declaration\r\nof Human Rights and the Convention on Genocide. It is moving ahead to give\r\nmeaning to the concept of world brotherhood through a wide variety of\r\ncultural, economic, and technical activities.\r\n\r\nThe events of the past year again showed the value of the United Nations in\r\nbringing about the peaceful adjustment of tense international\r\ncontroversies. In Indonesia and in Palestine the efforts of the United\r\nNations have put a stop to bloodshed and paved the way to peaceful\r\nsettlements.\r\n\r\nWe are working toward the time when the United Nations will control weapons\r\nof mass destruction and will have the forces to preserve international law\r\nand order. While the world remains unsettled, however, and as long as our\r\nown security and the security of the free world require, we will maintain a\r\nstrong and well-balanced defense organization. The Selective Service System\r\nis an essential part of our defense plans, and it must be continued.\r\n\r\nUnder the principles of the United Nations Charter we must continue to\r\nshare in the common defense of free nations against aggression. At the last\r\nsession this Congress laid the basis for this joint effort. We now must put\r\ninto effect the common defense plans that are being worked out.\r\n\r\nWe shall continue our efforts for world economic recovery, because world\r\nprosperity is the only sure foundation of a permanent peace.\r\n\r\nAs an immediate means to this end we must continue our support of the\r\nEuropean recovery program. This program has achieved great success in the\r\nfirst 2 years of its operation, but it has not yet been completed. If we\r\nwere to stop this program now, or cripple it, just because it is\r\nsucceeding, we should be doing exactly what the enemies of democracy want\r\nus to do. We should be just as foolish as a man who, for reasons of false\r\neconomy, failed to put a roof on his house after building the foundation\r\nand the walls.\r\n\r\nWorld prosperity also requires that we do all we can to expand world trade.\r\nAs a major step in this direction we should promptly join the International\r\nTrade Organization. The purpose of this organization, which the United\r\nStates has been foremost in creating, is to establish a code of fair\r\npractice, and an international authority for adjusting differences in\r\ninternational commercial relations. It is an effort to prevent the kind of\r\nanarchy and irresponsibility in world trade which did so much to bring\r\nabout the world depression of the 1930's. An expanding world economy\r\nrequires the improvement of living standards and the development of\r\nresources in areas where human poverty and misery now prevail. Without such\r\nimprovement the recovery of Europe and the future of our own economy will\r\nnot be secure. I urge that the Congress adopt the legislation now before it\r\nto provide for increasing the flow of technical assistance and capital\r\ninvestment in underdeveloped regions.\r\n\r\nIt is more essential now than ever, if the ideals of freedom and\r\nrepresentative government are to prevail in these areas, and particularly\r\nin the Far East, that their peoples experience, in their own lives, the\r\nbenefits of scientific and economic advances. This program will require the\r\nmovement of large amounts of capital from the industrial nations, and\r\nparticularly from the United States, to productive uses in the\r\nunderdeveloped areas of the world. Recent world events make prompt action\r\nimperative.\r\n\r\nThis program is in the interest of all peoples-and has nothing in common\r\nwith either the old imperialism of the last century or the new imperialism\r\nof the Communists.\r\n\r\nOur aim for a peaceful, democratic world of free peoples will be achieved\r\nin the long run, not by force of arms, but by an appeal to the minds and\r\nhearts of men. If the peace policy of the democratic nations is to be\r\nsuccessful, they must demonstrate that the benefits of their way of life\r\ncan be increased and extended to all nations and all races.\r\n\r\nIn the world today we are confronted with the danger that the rising demand\r\nof people everywhere for freedom and a better life may be corrupted and\r\nbetrayed by the false promises of communism. In its ruthless struggle for\r\npower, communism seizes upon our imperfections, and takes advantage of the\r\ndelays and setbacks which the democratic nations experience in their effort\r\nto secure a better life for their citizens. This challenge to us is more\r\nthan a military challenge. It is a challenge to the honesty of our\r\nprofession of the democratic faith; it is a challenge to the efficiency and\r\nstability of our economic system; it is a challenge to the willingness to\r\nwork with other peoples for world peace and for world prosperity.\r\n\r\nFor my part I welcome that challenge. I believe that our country, at this\r\ncrucial point in world history, will meet that challenge successfully. I\r\nbelieve that, in cooperation with the other free nations of the world, we\r\nshall extend the full benefits of the democratic way of life to millions\r\nwho do not now enjoy them, and preserve mankind from dictatorship and\r\ntyranny.\r\n\r\nI believe that we shall succeed in our struggle for this peace, because I\r\nhave seen the success we have had in our own country in following the\r\nprinciples of freedom. Over the last 50 years, the ideals of liberty and\r\nequal opportunity to which this Nation is dedicated have been increasingly\r\nrealized in the lives of our people.\r\n\r\nThe ideal of equal opportunity no longer means simply the opportunity which\r\na man has to advance beyond his fellows. Some of our citizens do achieve\r\ngreater success than others as a reward for individual merit and effort,\r\nand this is as it should be. At the same time our country must be more than\r\na land of opportunity for a select few. It must be a land of opportunity\r\nfor all of us. In such a land we can grow and prosper together.\r\n\r\nThe simple truth that we can all go forward together is often questioned by\r\nselfish or shortsighted persons. It is strange that this is so, for this\r\nproposition is so clearly demonstrated by our national history. During the\r\nlast 50 years, for example, our Nation has grown enormously in material\r\nwell-being. This growth has come about, not by concentrating the benefits\r\nof our progress in the hands of a few, but by increasing the wealth of the\r\ngreat body of our Nation and our citizens.\r\n\r\nIn the last 50 years the income of the average family has increased so\r\ngreatly that its buying power has doubled. The average hours of work have\r\ndeclined from 60 to 40 a week, the whole hourly production of the average\r\nworker has tripled. Average wages, allowing for price changes, have\r\nincreased from about 45 cents an hour to $1.40 an hour.\r\n\r\nWe have accomplished what to earlier ages of mankind would have been a\r\nmiracle--we work shorter hours, we produce more, and we live better.\r\n\r\nIncreasing freedom from poverty and drudgery has given a fuller meaning to\r\nAmerican life. Our people are better educated; we have more opportunities\r\nfor travel and recreation and enjoyment of the arts. We enjoy more personal\r\nliberty in the United States today than ever before.\r\n\r\nIf we can continue in the spirit of cooperative adventure which has marked\r\nthe recent years of our progress, we can expect further scientific\r\nadvances, further increases in our standard of living, and a still wider\r\nenjoyment of democratic freedom.\r\n\r\nNo one, of course, can foretell the future exactly. However, if we assume\r\nthat we shall grow as fast in the future as we have grown in the past, we\r\ncan get a good idea of how much our country should grow in the next 50\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nAt present our total national production is $255 billion a year. Our\r\nworking population and our output per worker are increasing. If our\r\nproductive power continues to increase at the same rate as it has increased\r\nover the past 50 years, our total national production 50 years from now\r\nwill be nearly four times as much as it is today. Allowing for the expected\r\ngrowth in population, this would mean that the real income of the average\r\nfamily in the year 2000 A.D. would be about three times what it is today.\r\n\r\nThese are estimates of what we can do in the future, but we can reach these\r\nheights only if we follow the right policies. We have learned by bitter\r\nexperience that progress is not automatic--that wrong policies lead to\r\ndepression and disaster. We cannot achieve these gains unless we have a\r\nstable economy and avoid the catastrophes of boom and bust that have set us\r\nback in the past.\r\n\r\nThese gains cannot be achieved unless our businessmen maintain their spirit\r\nof initiative and enterprise and operate in a competitive economy. They\r\ncannot be achieved unless our workingmen and women and their unions help to\r\nincrease productivity and obtain for labor a fair share of the benefits of\r\nour economic system. They cannot be achieved unless we have a stable and\r\nprosperous agriculture. They cannot be achieved unless we conserve and\r\ndevelop our natural resources in the public interest. Our system will not\r\nwork unless our people are healthy, well-educated, and confident of the\r\nfuture. It will not work unless all citizens can participate fully in our\r\nnational life.\r\n\r\nIn achieving these gains the Government has a special responsibility to\r\nhelp create and maintain the conditions which will permit the growth we\r\nknow is possible. Foremost among these conditions is the need for a fair\r\ndistribution of our increasing prosperity among all the great groups of our\r\npopulation who help to bring it about-labor, business, agriculture.\r\n\r\nBusinessmen must continue to have the incentives necessary for investment\r\nand for the development of new lines of enterprise. In the future growth of\r\nthis country, lie possibilities for hundreds of thousands of new and\r\nindependent businesses. As our national production increases, as it doubles\r\nand redoubles in the next 50 years, the number of independent and competing\r\nenterprises should also increase. If the number does not increase, our\r\nconstantly growing economy will fall under the control of a few dominant\r\neconomic groups whose powers will be so great that they will be a challenge\r\nto democratic institutions.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this danger, we must curb monopoly and provide aids to independent\r\nbusiness so that it may have the credit and capital to compete in a system\r\nof free enterprise. I recommend that the Congress complete action at this\r\nsession on the pending bill to close the loopholes in the Clayton Act which\r\nnow permit monopolistic mergers. I also hope before this session is over to\r\ntransmit to the Congress a series of proposals to strengthen the\r\nantimonopoly laws, to assist small business, and to encourage the growth of\r\nnew enterprises.\r\n\r\nIn the case of labor, free collective bargaining must be protected and\r\nencouraged. Collective bargaining is not only a fundamental economic\r\nfreedom for labor. It is also a strengthening and stabilizing influence for\r\nour whole economy.\r\n\r\nThe Federal statute now governing labor relations is punitive in purpose\r\nand one-sided in operation. This statute is, and always has been,\r\ninconsistent with the practice of true and effective collective bargaining.\r\nIt should be repealed and replaced by a law that is fair to all and in\r\nharmony with our democratic ideals.\r\n\r\nA full understanding of the problems of modern labor relations is of such\r\nimportance that I recommend the establishment of a labor extension service\r\nto encourage educational activities in this field.\r\n\r\nAnother essential for our continued growth is a stable and prosperous\r\nagriculture. For many years we have been building a program to give the\r\nfarmer a reasonable measure of protection against the special hazards to\r\nwhich he is exposed. That program was improved at the last session of the\r\nCongress. However, our farm legislation is still not adequate.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Congress has properly declared as a matter of national policy\r\nthat safeguards must be maintained against slumps in farm prices, there are\r\nserious shortcomings in the methods now available for carrying out this\r\npolicy. Mandatory price supports should be provided for the commodities not\r\nnow covered which are major sources of farm income.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we should provide a method of supporting farm income at fair\r\nlevels which will, at the same time, avoid piling up unmanageable surpluses\r\nand allow consumers to obtain the full benefit of our abundant agricultural\r\nproduction. A system of production payments gives the greatest promise of\r\naccomplishing this purpose. I recommend that the use of such a system be\r\nauthorized.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important factors in our continued growth is the\r\nconstruction of more good, up-to-date housing. In a country such as ours\r\nthere is no reason why decent homes should not be within the reach of all.\r\nWith the help of various Government programs we have made great progress in\r\nthe last few years in increasing the number of homes.\r\n\r\nDespite this increase, there is still an acute shortage of housing for the\r\nlower and middle-income groups, especially in large metropolitan areas. We\r\nhave laid the groundwork for relieving the plight of lower-income families\r\nin the Housing Act of 1949. To aid the middle-income families, I recommend\r\nthat the Congress enact new legislation authorizing a vigorous program to\r\nhelp cooperatives and other nonprofit groups build housing which these\r\nfamilies can afford.\r\n\r\nRent control has done a great deal to prevent the housing shortage from\r\nhaving had worse effects during this postwar period of adjustment. Rent\r\ncontrol is still necessary to prevent widespread hardship and sharp\r\ncurtailment of the buying power of millions of consumers in metropolitan\r\nareas. I recommend, therefore, that rent control be continued for another\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nIf we are to achieve a better life for all, the natural resources of the\r\ncountry must be regarded as a public trust. We must use our precious assets\r\nof soil, water, and forest, and grassland in such a way that they become\r\nconstantly more productive and more valuable. Government investment in the\r\nconservation and development of our resources is necessary to the future\r\neconomic expansion of the country.\r\n\r\nWe need to enlarge the production and transmission of public power. That is\r\ntrue not only in those regions which have already received great benefits\r\nfrom Federal power projects, but also in regions such as New England where\r\nthe benefits of large-scale public power development have not yet been\r\nexperienced.\r\n\r\nIn our hydroelectric and irrigation undertakings, as well as in our other\r\nresource programs, we must continue policies to assure that their benefits\r\nwill be spread among the many and not restricted to the favored few.\r\n\r\nImportant resource legislation which should be passed at this session\r\nincludes the authorization of the St. Lawrence seaway and power project and\r\nthe establishment of the Columbia Valley Administration--the establishment\r\nof the Columbia Valley Administration, I don't want you to miss that.\r\n\r\nThrough wise Government policies and Government expenditures for the\r\nconservation and development of our natural resources, we can be sure of\r\ntransmitting to our children and our children's children a country far\r\nricher and more productive than the one we know today.\r\n\r\nThe value of our natural resources is constantly being increased by the\r\nprogress of science. Research is finding new ways of using such natural\r\nassets as minerals, sea water, and plant life. In the peaceful development\r\nof atomic energy, particularly, we stand on the threshold of new wonders.\r\nThe first experimental machines for producing useful power from atomic\r\nenergy are now under construction. We have made only the first beginnings\r\nin this field, but in the perspective of history they may loom larger than\r\nthe first airplane, or even the first tools that started man on the road to\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nTo take full advantage of the increasing possibilities of nature we must\r\nequip ourselves with increasing knowledge. Government has a responsibility\r\nto see that our country maintains its position in the advance of science.\r\nAs a step toward this end, the Congress should complete action on the\r\nmeasure to create a National Science Foundation.\r\n\r\nAnother duty of the Government is to promote the economic security, the\r\nhealth, and the education of its citizens. By so doing, we strengthen both\r\nour economy and the structure of our society. In a nation as rich as ours,\r\nall citizens should be able to live in decency and health.\r\n\r\nOur Social Security System should be developed into the main reliance of\r\nour people for basic protection against the economic hazards of old-age,\r\nunemployment, and illness. I earnestly hope that the Congress will complete\r\naction at this session on legislation to increase the benefits and extend\r\nthe coverage of old-age and survivors' insurance. The widespread movement\r\nto provide pensions in private industry dramatizes the need for\r\nimprovements in the public insurance system.\r\n\r\nI also urge that the Congress strengthen our unemployment compensation law\r\nto meet present-day needs more adequately. The economic downturn of the\r\npast year was the first real test that our system of unemployment insurance\r\nhas had to meet. That test has proved the wisdom of the system, but it has\r\nalso made strikingly apparent the need for improving its operation and\r\nincreasing its coverage and its benefits.\r\n\r\nIn the field of health there are immense opportunities to extend to more of\r\nour people the benefits of the amazing advances in medical science. We have\r\nmade a good beginning in expanding our hospitals, but we must also go on to\r\nremedy the shortages of doctors, nurses, and public health services, and to\r\nestablish a system of medical insurance which will enable all Americans to\r\nafford good medical care.\r\n\r\nWe must take immediate steps to strengthen our educational system. In many\r\nparts of our country, young people are being handicapped for life because\r\nof a poor education. The rapidly increasing number of children of school\r\nage, coupled with the shortage of qualified teachers, makes this problem\r\nmore critical each year. I believe that the Congress should no longer delay\r\nin providing Federal assistance to the States so that they can maintain\r\nadequate schools.\r\n\r\nAs we go forward in achieving greater economic security and greater\r\nopportunity for all our people, we should make every effort to extend the\r\nbenefits of our democratic institutions to every citizen. The religious\r\nideals which we profess, and the heritage of freedom which we have received\r\nfrom the past, clearly place that duty upon us. I again urge the Congress\r\nto enact the civil rights proposals I made in February 1948. These\r\nproposals are for the enactment of Federal statutes which will protect all\r\nour people in the exercise of their democratic rights and their search for\r\neconomic opportunity, grant statehood to Alaska and Hawaii, provide a\r\ngreater measure of self-government for our island possessions, and accord\r\nhome rule to the District of Columbia. Some of those proposals have been\r\nbefore the Congress for a long time. Those who oppose them, as well as\r\nthose who favor them, should recognize that it is the duty of the elected\r\nrepresentatives of the people to let these proposals come to a vote.\r\n\r\nOur democratic ideals, as well as our best interests, require that we do\r\nour fair share in providing homes for the unfortunate victims of war and\r\ntyranny. In so doing, we shall add strength to our democracy through the\r\nabilities and skills which these men and women will bring here. I urge the\r\nprompt enactment by the Congress of the legislation now before it to extend\r\nand broaden the existing displaced persons law and remove its\r\ndiscriminatory features.\r\n\r\nThe measures I am recommending to the Congress concerning both our foreign\r\nand our domestic policies represent a carefully considered program to meet\r\nour national needs. It is a program which necessarily requires large\r\nexpenditures of funds. More than 70 percent of the Government's\r\nexpenditures are required to meet the costs of past wars and to work for\r\nworld peace. This is the dominant factor in our fiscal policy. At the same\r\ntime, the Government must make substantial expenditures which are necessary\r\nto the growth and expansion of the domestic economy.\r\n\r\nAt present, largely because of the ill-considered tax reduction of the Both\r\nCongress, the Government is not receiving enough revenue to meet its\r\nnecessary expenditures.\r\n\r\nTo meet this situation, I am proposing that Federal expenditures be held to\r\nthe lowest levels consistent with our international requirements and the\r\nessential needs of economic growth, and the well-being of our people. I\r\nthink I had better read that over; you interrupted me in the middle.\r\n\r\nTo meet this situation, I am proposing that Federal expenditures be held to\r\nthe lowest levels consistent with our international requirements and the\r\nessential needs of economic growth, and the well-being of our people. Don't\r\nforget that last phrase. At the same time, we must guard against the folly\r\nof attempting budget slashes which would impair our prospects for peace or\r\ncripple the programs essential to our national strength.\r\n\r\nThe budget recommendations I shall shortly transmit to the Congress show\r\nthat we can expect a substantial improvement in our fiscal position over\r\nthe next few years, as the cost of some of our extraordinary postwar\r\nprograms declines, and as the Government revenue rises as a result of\r\ngrowth in employment and national income. To further improve our fiscal\r\noutlook, we should make some changes in our tax system which will reduce\r\npresent inequities, stimulate business activity, and yield a moderate\r\namount of additional revenue. I expect to transmit specific recommendations\r\nto the Congress on this subject at a very early date.\r\n\r\nThe fiscal policy I am recommending is the quickest and safest way of\r\nachieving a balanced budget.\r\n\r\nAs we move forward into the second half of the 20th century, we must always\r\nbear in mind the central purpose of our national life. We do not seek\r\nmaterial prosperity for ourselves because we love luxury; we do not aid\r\nother nations because we wish to increase our power. We have not devised\r\nprograms for the security and well-being of our people because we are\r\nafraid or unwilling to take risks. This is not the meaning of our past\r\nhistory or our present course.\r\n\r\nWe work for a better life for all, so that all men may put to good use the\r\ngreat gifts with which they have been endowed by their Creator. We seek to\r\nestablish those material conditions of life in which, without exception,\r\nmen may live in dignity, perform useful work, serve their communities, and\r\nworship God as they see fit.\r\n\r\nThese may seem simple goals, but they are not little ones. They are worth a\r\ngreat deal more than all the empires and conquests of history. They are not\r\nto be achieved by military aggression or political fanaticism. They are to\r\nbe achieved by humbler means-by hard work, by a spirit of self-restraint in\r\nour dealings with one another, and by a deep devotion to the principles of\r\njustice and equality.\r\n\r\nIt should make us truly thankful, as we look back to the beginnings of this\r\ncountry, that we have come so far along the road to a better life for all.\r\nIt should make us humble to think, as we look ahead, how much farther we\r\nhave to go to accomplish, at home and abroad, the objectives that were set\r\nout for us at the founding of this great Nation.\r\n\r\nAs we approach the halfway mark of the 20th century, we should ask for\r\ncontinued strength and guidance from that Almighty Power who has placed\r\nbefore us such great opportunities for the good of mankind in the years to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nHarry S. Truman\r\nJanuary 8, 1951\r\n\r\nMr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Congress:\r\n\r\nThis 82d Congress faces as grave a task as any Congress in the history of\r\nour Republic. The actions you take will be watched by the whole world.\r\nThese actions will measure the ability of a free people, acting through\r\ntheir chosen representatives and their free institutions, to meet a deadly\r\nchallenge to their way of life.\r\n\r\nWe can meet this challenge foolishly or wisely. We can meet it timidly or\r\nbravely, shamefully or honorably.\r\n\r\nI know that the 82d Congress will meet this challenge in a way worthy of\r\nour great heritage. I know that your debates will be earnest, responsible,\r\nconstructive, and to the point. I know that from these debates there will\r\ncome the great decisions needed to carry us forward.\r\n\r\nAt this critical time, I am glad to say that our country is in a healthy\r\ncondition. Our democratic institutions are sound and strong. We have more\r\nmen and women at work than ever before. We are able to produce more than\r\never before--in fact, far more than any country ever produced in the\r\nhistory of the world.\r\n\r\nI am confident that we can succeed in the great task that lies before us.\r\n\r\nWe will succeed, but we must all do our part. We must all act together as\r\ncitizens of this great Republic.\r\n\r\nAs we meet here today, American soldiers are fighting a bitter campaign in\r\nKorea. We pay tribute to their courage, devotion, and gallantry.\r\n\r\nOur men are fighting, alongside their United Nations allies, because they\r\nknow, as we do, that the aggression in Korea is part of the attempt of the\r\nRussian Communist dictatorship to take over the world, step by step.\r\n\r\nOur men are fighting a long way from home, but they are fighting for our\r\nlives and our liberties. They are fighting to protect our right to meet\r\nhere today--our right to govern ourselves as a free nation.\r\n\r\nThe threat of world conquest by Soviet Russia endangers our liberty and\r\nendangers the kind of world in which the free spirit of man can survive.\r\nThis threat is aimed at all peoples who strive to win or defend their own\r\nfreedom and national independence.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the state of our Nation is in great part the state of our friends\r\nand allies throughout the world. The gun that points at them points at us,\r\nalso. The threat is a total threat and the danger is a common danger.\r\n\r\nAll free nations are exposed and all are in peril. Their only security lies\r\nin banding together. No one nation can find protection in a selfish search\r\nfor a safe haven from the storm.\r\n\r\nThe free nations do not have any aggressive purpose. We want only peace in\r\nthe world--peace for all countries. No threat to the security of any nation\r\nis concealed in our plans and programs.\r\n\r\nWe had hoped that the Soviet Union, with its security assured by the\r\nCharter of the United Nations, would be willing to live and let live. But I\r\nam sorry to say that has not been the case.\r\n\r\nThe imperialism of the czars has been replaced by the even more ambitious,\r\nmore crafty, and more menacing imperialism of the rulers of the Soviet\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nThis new imperialism has powerful military forces. It is keeping millions\r\nof men under arms. It has a large air force and a strong submarine force.\r\nIt has complete control of the men and equipment of its satellites. It has\r\nkept its subject peoples and its economy in a state of perpetual\r\nmobilization.\r\n\r\nThe present rulers of the Soviet Union have shown that they are willing to\r\nuse this power to destroy the free nations and win domination over the\r\nwhole world.\r\n\r\nThe Soviet imperialists have two ways of going about their destructive\r\nwork. They use the method of subversion and internal revolution, and they\r\nuse the method of external aggression. In preparation for either of these\r\nmethods of attack, they stir up class strife and disorder. They encourage\r\nsabotage. They put out poisonous propaganda. They deliberately try to\r\nprevent economic improvement.\r\n\r\nIf their efforts are successful, they foment a revolution, as they did in\r\nCzechoslovakia and China, and as they tried, unsuccessfully, to do in\r\nGreece. If their methods of subversion are blocked, and if they think they\r\ncan get away with outright warfare, they resort to external aggression.\r\nThis is what they did when they loosed the armies of their puppet states\r\nagainst the Republic of Korea, in an evil war by proxy.\r\n\r\nWe of the free world must be ready to meet both of these methods of Soviet\r\naction. We must not neglect one or the other.\r\n\r\nThe free world has power and resources to meet these two forms of\r\naggression--resources that are far greater than those of the Soviet\r\ndictatorship. We have skilled and vigorous peoples, great industrial\r\nstrength, and abundant sources of raw materials. And above all, we cherish\r\nliberty. Our common ideals are a great part of our strength. These ideals\r\nare the driving force of human progress.\r\n\r\nThe free nations believe in the dignity and the worth of man.\r\n\r\nWe believe in independence for all nations.\r\n\r\nWe believe that free and independent nations can band together into a world\r\norder based on law. We have laid the cornerstone of such a peaceful world\r\nin the United Nations.\r\n\r\nWe believe that such a world order can and should spread the benefits of\r\nmodern science and industry, better health and education, more food and\r\nrising standards of living--throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThese ideals give our cause a power and vitality that Russian communism can\r\nnever command.\r\n\r\nThe free nations, however, are bound together by more than ideals. They are\r\na real community bound together also by the ties of self-interest and\r\nself-preservation. If they should fall apart, the results would be fatal to\r\nhuman freedom.\r\n\r\nOur own national security is deeply involved with that of the other free\r\nnations. While they need our support, we equally need theirs. Our national\r\nsafety would be gravely prejudiced if the Soviet Union were to succeed in\r\nharnessing to its war machine the resources and the manpower of the free\r\nnations on the borders of its empire.\r\n\r\nIf Western Europe were to fall to Soviet Russia, it would double the Soviet\r\nsupply of coal and triple the Soviet supply of steel. If the free countries\r\nof Asia and Africa should fall to Soviet Russia, we would lose the sources\r\nof many of our most vital raw materials, including uranium, which is the\r\nbasis of our atomic power. And Soviet command of the manpower of the free\r\nnations of Europe and Asia would confront us with military forces which we\r\ncould never hope to equal.\r\n\r\nIn such a situation, the Soviet Union could impose its demands on the\r\nworld, without resort to conflict, simply through the preponderance of its\r\neconomic and military power. The Soviet Union does not have to attack the\r\nUnited States to secure domination of the world. It can achieve its ends by\r\nisolating us and swallowing up all our allies. Therefore, even if we were\r\ncraven enough I do not believe we could be--but, I say, even if we were\r\ncraven enough to abandon our ideals, it would be disastrous for us to\r\nwithdraw from the community of free nations.\r\n\r\nWe are the most powerful single member of this community, and we have a\r\nspecial responsibility. We must take the leadership in meeting the\r\nchallenge to freedom and in helping to protect the rights of independent\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nThis country has a practical, realistic program of action for meeting this\r\nchallenge.\r\n\r\nFirst, we shall have to extend economic assistance, where it can be\r\neffective. The best way to stop subversion by the Kremlin is to strike at\r\nthe roots of social injustice and economic disorder. People who have jobs,\r\nhomes, and hopes for the future will defend themselves against the\r\nunderground agents of the Kremlin. Our programs of economic aid have done\r\nmuch to turn back Communism,\r\n\r\nIn Europe the Marshall plan has had an electrifying result. As European\r\nrecovery progressed, the strikes led by the Kremlin's agents in Italy and\r\nFrance failed. All over Western Europe the Communist Party took worse and\r\nworse beatings at the polls.\r\n\r\nThe countries which have received Marshall plan aid have been able, through\r\nhard work, to expand their productive strength-in many cases, to levels\r\nhigher than ever before in their history. Without this strength they would\r\nbe completely incapable of defending themselves today. They are now ready\r\nto use this strength in helping to build a strong combined defense against\r\naggression.\r\n\r\nWe shall need to continue some economic aid to European countries. This aid\r\nshould now be specifically related to the building of their defenses.\r\n\r\nIn other parts of the world our economic assistance will need to be more\r\nbroadly directed toward economic development. In the Near East, in Africa,\r\nin Asia, we must do what we can to help people who are striving to advance\r\nfrom misery, poverty, and hunger. We must also continue to help the\r\neconomic growth of our good neighbors in this hemisphere. These actions\r\nwill bring greater strength for the free world. They will give many people\r\na real stake in the future and reason to defend their freedom. They will\r\nmean increased production of goods they need and materials we need.\r\n\r\nSecond, we shall need to continue our military assistance to countries\r\nwhich want to defend themselves.\r\n\r\nThe heart of our common defense effort is the North Atlantic community. The\r\ndefense of Europe is the basis for the defense of the whole free\r\nworld--ourselves included. Next to the United States, Europe is the largest\r\nworkshop in the world. It is also a homeland of the great religious beliefs\r\nshared by many of our citizens beliefs which are now threatened by the tide\r\nof atheistic communism.\r\n\r\nStrategically, economically, and morally, the defense of Europe is a part\r\nof our own defense. That is why we have joined with the countries of Europe\r\nin the North Atlantic Treaty, pledging ourselves to work with them.\r\n\r\nThere has been much discussion recently over whether the European countries\r\nare willing to defend themselves. Their actions are answering this\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nOur North Atlantic Treaty partners have strict systems of universal\r\nmilitary training. Several have recently increased the term of service. All\r\nhave taken measures to improve the quality of training. Forces are being\r\ntrained and expanded as rapidly as the necessary arms and equipment can be\r\nsupplied from their factories and ours. Our North Atlantic Treaty partners,\r\ntogether, are building armies bigger than our own.\r\n\r\nNone of the North Atlantic Treaty countries, including our own country, has\r\ndone enough yet. But real progress is being made. Together, we have worked\r\nout defense plans. The military leaders of our own country took part in\r\nworking out these plans, and are agreed that they are sound and within our\r\ncapabilities.\r\n\r\nTo put these plans into action, we sent to Europe last week one of our\r\ngreatest military commanders, General Dwight D. Eisenhower.\r\n\r\nGeneral Eisenhower went to Europe to assume command of the united forces of\r\nthe North Atlantic Treaty countries, including our own forces in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe people of Europe have confidence in General Eisenhower. They know his\r\nability to put together a fighting force of allies. His mission is vital to\r\nour security. We should all stand behind him, and give him every bit of\r\nhelp we can.\r\n\r\nPart of our job will be to reinforce the military strength of our European\r\npartners by sending them weapons and equipment as our military production\r\nexpands.\r\n\r\nOur program of military assistance extends to the nations in the Near East\r\nand the Far East which are trying to defend their freedom. Soviet communism\r\nis trying to make these nations into colonies, and to use their people as\r\ncannon fodder in new wars of conquest. We want their people to be free men\r\nand to enjoy peace.\r\n\r\nOur country has always stood for freedom for the peoples of Asia. Long,\r\nlong ago it stood for the freedom of the peoples of Asia. Our history shows\r\nthis. We have demonstrated it in the Philippines. We have demonstrated it\r\nin our relations with Indonesia, India, and with China. We hope to join in\r\nrestoring the people of Japan to membership in the community of free\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nIt is in the Far East that we have taken up arms, under the United Nations,\r\nto preserve the principle of independence for free nations. We are fighting\r\nto keep the forces of Communist aggression from making a slave state out of\r\nKorea.\r\n\r\nKorea has tremendous significance for the world. It means that free\r\nnations, acting through the United Nations, are fighting together against\r\naggression.\r\n\r\nWe will understand the importance of this best if we look back into\r\nhistory. If the democracies had stood up against the invasion of Manchuria\r\nin 1931, or the attack on Ethiopia in 1935, or the seizure of Austria in\r\n1938, if they had stood together against aggression on those occasions as\r\nthe United Nations has done in Korea, the whole history of our time would\r\nhave been different.\r\n\r\nThe principles for which we are fighting in Korea are right and just. They\r\nare the foundations of collective security and of the future of free\r\nnations. Korea is not only a country undergoing the torment of aggression;\r\nit is also a symbol. It stands for right and justice in the world against\r\noppression and slavery. The free world must always stand for these\r\nprinciples--and we will stand with the free world.\r\n\r\nAs the third part of our program, we will continue to work for peaceful\r\nsettlements in international disputes. We will support the United Nations\r\nand remain loyal to the great principles of international cooperation laid\r\ndown in its charter.\r\n\r\nWe are willing, as we have always been, to negotiate honorable settlements\r\nwith the Soviet Union. But we will not engage in appeasement.\r\n\r\nThe Soviet rulers have made it clear that we must have strength as well as\r\nright on our side. If we build our strength--and we are building it--the\r\nSoviet rulers may face the facts and lay aside their plans to take over the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThat is what we hope will happen, and that is what we are trying to bring\r\nabout. That is the only realistic road to peace.\r\n\r\nThese are the main elements of the course our Nation must follow as a\r\nmember of the community of free nations. These are the things we must do to\r\npreserve our security and help create a peaceful world. But they will be\r\nsuccessful only if we increase the strength of our own country.\r\n\r\nHere at home we have some very big jobs to do. We are building much\r\nstronger military forces--and we are building them fast. We are preparing\r\nfor full wartime mobilization, if that should be necessary. And we are\r\ncontinuing to build a strong and growing economy, able to maintain whatever\r\neffort may be required for as long as necessary.\r\n\r\nWe are building our own Army, Navy, and Air Force to an active strength of\r\nnearly 3 1/2 million men and women. We are stepping up the training of the\r\nreserve forces, and establishing more training facilities, so that we can\r\nrapidly increase our active forces far more on short notice.\r\n\r\nWe are going to produce all the weapons and equipment that such an armed\r\nforce will need. Furthermore, we will make weapons for our allies, and\r\nweapons for our own reserve supplies. On top of this, we will build the\r\ncapacity to turn out on short notice arms and supplies that may be needed\r\nfor a full-scale war.\r\n\r\nFortunately, we have a good start on this because of our enormous plant\r\ncapacity and because of the equipment on hand from the last war. For\r\nexample, many combat ships are being returned to active duty from the\r\n\"mothball fleet\" and many others can be put into service on very short\r\nnotice. We have large reserves of arms and ammunition and thousands of\r\nworkers skilled in arms production.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, however, our stocks of weapons are low. In other cases,\r\nthose on hand are not the most modern. We have made remarkable technical\r\nadvances. We have developed new types of jet planes and powerful new tanks.\r\nWe are concentrating on producing the newest types of weapons and producing\r\nthem as fast as we can.\r\n\r\nThis production drive is more selective than the one we had during World\r\nWar II, but it is just as urgent and intense. It is a big program and it is\r\na costly one.\r\n\r\nLet me give you two concrete examples. Our present program calls for\r\nexpanding the aircraft industry so that it will have the capacity to\r\nproduce 50,000 modern military planes a year. We are preparing the capacity\r\nto produce 35,000 tanks a year. We are not now ordering that many planes or\r\nthat many tanks, and we hope that we never have to, but we mean to be able\r\nto turn them out if we need them.\r\n\r\nThe planes we are producing now are much bigger, much better, and much more\r\nexpensive than the planes we had during the last war.\r\n\r\nWe used to think that the B-17 was a huge plane, and the blockbuster it\r\ncarried a huge load. But the B-36 can carry five of these blockbusters in\r\nits belly, and it can carry them five times as far. Of course, the B-36 is\r\nmuch more complicated to build than the B-17, and far more expensive. One\r\nB-17 costs $275,000, while now one B-36 costs $3 1/2 million.\r\n\r\nI ask you to remember that what we are doing is to provide the best and\r\nmost modern military equipment in the world for our fighting forces.\r\n\r\nThis kind of defense production program has two parts.\r\n\r\nThe first part is to get our defense production going as fast as possible.\r\nWe have to convert plants and channel materials to defense production. This\r\nmeans heavy cuts in civilian uses of copper, aluminum, rubber, and other\r\nessential materials. It means shortages in various consumer goods.\r\n\r\nThe second part is to increase our capacity to produce and to keep our\r\neconomy strong for the long pull. We do not know how long Communist\r\naggression will threaten the world.\r\n\r\nOnly by increasing our output can we carry the burden of preparedness for\r\nan indefinite period in the future. This means that we will have to build\r\nmore power plants and more steel mills, grow more cotton, mine more copper,\r\nand expand our capacity in many other ways.\r\n\r\nThe Congress will need to consider legislation, at this session, affecting\r\nall the aspects of our mobilization job. The main subjects on which\r\nlegislation will be needed are:\r\n\r\nFirst, appropriations for our military buildup.\r\n\r\nSecond, extension and revision of the Selective Service Act.\r\n\r\nThird, military and economic aid to help build up the strength of the free\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nFourth, revision and extension of the authority to expand production and to\r\nstabilize prices, wages, and rents.\r\n\r\nFifth, improvement of our agricultural laws to help obtain the kinds of\r\nfarm products we need for the defense effort.\r\n\r\nSixth, improvement of our labor laws to help provide stable\r\nlabor-management relations and to make sure that we have steady production\r\nin this emergency.\r\n\r\nSeventh, housing and training of defense workers and the full use of all\r\nour manpower resources.\r\n\r\nEighth, means for increasing the supply of doctors, nurses, and other\r\ntrained medical personnel critically needed for the defense effort.\r\n\r\nNinth, aid to the States to meet the most urgent needs of our elementary\r\nand secondary schools. Some of our plans will have to be deferred for the\r\ntime being. But we should do all we can to make sure our children are being\r\ntrained as good and useful citizens in the critical times ahead.\r\n\r\nTenth, a major increase in taxes to meet the cost of the defense effort.\r\n\r\nThe Economic Report and the Budget Message will discuss these subjects\r\nfurther. In addition, I shall send to the Congress special messages\r\ncontaining detailed recommendations on legislation needed at this Session.\r\n\r\nIn the months ahead the Government must give priority to activities that\r\nare urgent--like military procurement and atomic energy and power\r\ndevelopment. It must practice rigid economy in its nondefense activities.\r\nMany of the things we would normally do must be curtailed or postponed.\r\n\r\nBut in a long-term defense effort like this one, we cannot neglect the\r\nmeasures needed to maintain a strong economy and a healthy democratic\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nThe Congress, therefore, should give continued attention to the measures\r\nwhich our country will need for the long pull. And it should act upon such\r\nlegislation as promptly as circumstances permit.\r\n\r\nTo take just one example--we need to continue and complete the work of\r\nrounding out our system of social insurance. We still need to improve our\r\nprotection against unemployment and old age. We still need to provide\r\ninsurance against the loss of earnings through sickness, and against the\r\nhigh costs of modern medical care.\r\n\r\nAnd above all, we must remember that the fundamentals of our strength rest\r\nupon the freedoms of our people. We must continue our efforts to achieve\r\nthe full realization of our democratic ideals. We must uphold the freedom\r\nof speech and the freedom of conscience in our land. We must assure equal\r\nrights and equal opportunities to all our citizens.\r\n\r\nAs we go forward this year in the defense of freedom, let us keep dearly\r\nbefore us the nature of our present effort.\r\n\r\nWe are building up our strength, in concert with other free nations, to\r\nmeet the danger of aggression that has been turned loose on the world. The\r\nstrength of the free nations is the world's best hope of peace.\r\n\r\nI ask the Congress for unity in these crucial days.\r\n\r\nMake no mistake about my meaning. I do not ask, or expect, unanimity. I do\r\nnot ask for an end to debate. Only by debate can we arrive at decisions\r\nwhich are wise, and which reflect the desires of the American people. We do\r\nnot have a dictatorship in this country, and we never will have one in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWhen I request unity, what I am really asking for is a sense of\r\nresponsibility on the part of every Member of this Congress. Let us debate\r\nthe issues, but let every man among us weigh his words and his deeds. There\r\nis a sharp difference between harmful criticism and constructive criticism.\r\nIf we are truly responsible as individuals, I am sure that we will be\r\nunified as a government.\r\n\r\nLet us keep our eyes on the issues and work for the things we all believe\r\nin.\r\n\r\nLet each of us put our country ahead of our party, and ahead of our own\r\npersonal interests.\r\n\r\nI had the honor to be a Member of the Senate during World War II, and I\r\nknow from experience that unity of purpose and of effort is possible in the\r\nCongress without any lessening of the vitality of our two-party system.\r\n\r\nLet us all stand together as Americans. Let us stand together with all men\r\neverywhere who believe in human liberty.\r\n\r\nPeace is precious to us. It is the way of life we strive for with all the\r\nstrength and wisdom we possess. But more precious than peace are freedom\r\nand justice. We will fight, if fight we must, to keep our freedom and to\r\nprevent justice from being destroyed.\r\n\r\nThese are the things that give meaning to our lives, and which we\r\nacknowledge to be greater than ourselves.\r\n\r\nThis is our cause--peace, freedom, justice. We will pursue this cause with\r\ndetermination and humility, asking divine guidance that in all we do we may\r\nfollow the will of God.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nHarry S. Truman\r\nJanuary 9, 1952\r\n\r\nMr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Congress:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to report to the Congress on the state of the Union.\r\n\r\nAt the outset, I should like to speak of the necessity for putting first\r\nthings first as we work together this year for the good of our country.\r\n\r\nThe United States and the whole free world are passing through a period of\r\ngrave danger. Every action you take here in Congress, and every action that\r\nI take as President, must be measured against the test of whether it helps\r\nto meet that danger.\r\n\r\nThis will be a presidential election year-the year in which politics plays\r\na large part in our lives--a larger part than usual. That is perfectly\r\nproper. But we have a greater responsibility to conduct our political\r\nfights in a manner that does not harm the national interest.\r\n\r\nWe can find plenty of things to differ about without destroying our free\r\ninstitutions and without abandoning our bipartisan foreign policy for\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nWhen everything is said and done, all of us--Republicans and Democrats\r\nalike--all of us are Americans; and we are all going to sink or swim\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nWe are moving through a perilous time. Faced with a terrible threat of\r\naggression, our Nation has embarked upon a great effort to help establish\r\nthe kind of world in which peace shall be secure. Peace is our goal-not\r\npeace at any price, but a peace based on freedom and justice. We are now in\r\nthe midst of our effort to reach that goal. On the whole, we have been\r\ndoing very well.\r\n\r\nLast year, 1951, was a year in which we threw back aggression, added\r\ngreatly to our military strength, and improved the chances for peace and\r\nfreedom in many parts of the world.\r\n\r\nThis year, 1952, is a critical year in the defense effort of the whole free\r\nworld. If we falter we can lose all the gains we have made. If we drive\r\nahead, with courage and vigor and determination, we can by the end of 1952\r\nbe in a position of much greater security. The way will be dangerous for\r\nthe years ahead, but if we put forth our best efforts this year--and next\r\nyear--we can be \"over the hump\" in our effort to build strong defenses.\r\n\r\nWhen we look at the record of the past year, 1951, we find important things\r\non both the credit and the debit side of the ledger. We have made great\r\nadvances. At the same time we have run into new problems which must be\r\novercome.\r\n\r\nNow let us look at the credit side first.\r\n\r\nPeace depends upon the free nations sticking together, and making a\r\ncombined effort to check aggression and prevent war. In this respect, 1951\r\nwas a year of great achievement.\r\n\r\nIn Korea the forces of the United Nations turned hack the Chinese Communist\r\ninvasion-and did it without widening the area of conflict. The action of\r\nthe United Nations in Korea has been a powerful deterrent to a third world\r\nwar. However, the situation in Korea remains very hazardous. The outcome of\r\nthe armistice negotiation still remains uncertain.\r\n\r\nIn Indochina and Malaya, our aid has helped our allies to hold back the\r\nCommunist advance, although there are signs of further trouble in that\r\narea.\r\n\r\nIn 1951 we strengthened the chances of peace in the Pacific region by the\r\ntreaties with Japan and the defense arrangements with Australia, New\r\nZealand, and the Philippines.\r\n\r\nIn Europe combined defense has become a reality. The free nations have\r\ncreated a real fighting force. This force is not yet as strong as it needs\r\nto be; but it is already a real obstacle to any attempt by hostile forces\r\nto sweep across Europe to the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nIn 1951 we also moved to strengthen the security of Europe by the agreement\r\nto bring Greece and Turkey into the North Atlantic Treaty.\r\n\r\nThe United Nations, the world's greatest hope for peace, has come through a\r\nyear of trial stronger and more useful than ever. The free nations have\r\nstood together in blocking Communist attempts to tear up the charter.\r\n\r\nAt the present session of the United Nations in Paris, we, together with\r\nthe British and the French, offered a plan to reduce and control all\r\narmaments under a foolproof inspection system. This is a concrete,\r\npractical proposal for disarmament.\r\n\r\nBut what happened? Vishinsky laughed at it. Listen to what he said: \"I\r\ncould hardly sleep at all last night .... I could not sleep because I kept\r\nlaughing.\" The world will be a long time forgetting the spectacle of that\r\nfellow laughing at disarmament.\r\n\r\nDisarmament is not a joke. Vishinsky's laughter met with shock and anger\r\nfrom the people all over the world. And, as a result, Mr. Stalin's\r\nrepresentative received orders to stop laughing and start talking.\r\n\r\nIf the Soviet leaders were to accept this proposal, it would lighten the\r\nburden of armaments, and permit the resources of the earth to be devoted to\r\nthe good of mankind. But until the Soviet Union accepts a sound disarmament\r\nproposal, and joins in peaceful settlements, we have no choice except to\r\nbuild up our defenses.\r\n\r\nDuring this past year we added more than a million men and women to our\r\nArmed Forces. The total is now nearly 3 1/2 million. We have made rapid\r\nprogress in the field of atomic weapons. We have turned out billion worth\r\nof military supplies and equipment, three times as much as the year\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nEconomic conditions in the country are good. There are 61 million people on\r\nthe job; wages, farm incomes, and business profits are at high levels.\r\nTotal production of goods and services in our country has increased 8\r\npercent over last year--about twice the normal rate of growth.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most amazing thing about our economic progress is the way we\r\nare increasing our basic capacity to produce. For example, we are now in\r\nthe second year of a 3-year program which will double our output of\r\naluminum, increase our electric power supply by 40 percent, and increase\r\nour steelmaking capacity by 15 percent. We can then produce 120 million\r\ntons of steel a year, as much as all the rest of the world put together.\r\n\r\nThis expansion will mean more jobs and higher standards of living for all\r\nof us in the years ahead. At the present time it means greater strength for\r\nus and for the rest of the free world in the fight for peace.\r\n\r\nNow, I must turn to the debit side of the ledger for the past year.\r\n\r\nThe outstanding fact to note on the debit side of the ledger is that the\r\nSoviet Union, in 1951, continued to expand its military production and\r\nincrease its already excessive military power.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the Soviets have run into increasing difficulties. Their\r\nhostile policies have awakened stern resistance among free men throughout\r\nthe world. And behind the Iron Curtain the Soviet rule of force has created\r\ngrowing political and economic stresses in the satellite nations.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the grim fact remains that the Soviet Union is increasing its\r\narmed might. It is still producing more war planes than the free nations.\r\nIt has set off two more atomic explosions. The world still walks in the\r\nshadow of another world war.\r\n\r\nAnd here at home, our defense preparations are far from complete.\r\n\r\nDuring 1951 we did not make adequate progress in building up civil defense\r\nagainst atomic attack. This is a major weakness in our plans for peace,\r\nsince inadequate civilian defense is an open invitation to a surprise\r\nattack. Failure to provide adequate civilian defense has the same effect as\r\nadding to the enemy's supply of atomic bombs.\r\n\r\nIn the field of defense production we have run into difficulties and delays\r\nin designing and producing the latest types of airplanes and tanks. Some\r\nmachine tools and metals are still in extremely short supply.\r\n\r\nIn other free countries the defense buildup has created severe economic\r\nproblems. It has increased inflation in Europe and has endangered the\r\ncontinued recovery of our allies.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle East political tensions and the oil controversy in Iran are\r\nkeeping the region in a turmoil. In the Far East the dark threat of\r\nCommunist imperialism still hangs over many nations.\r\n\r\nThis, very briefly, is the good side and the bad side of the picture.\r\n\r\nTaking the good and bad together, we have made real progress this last year\r\nalong the road to peace. We have increased the power and unity of the free\r\nworld. And while we were doing this, we have avoided world war on the one\r\nhand, and appeasement on the other. This is a hard road to follow, but the\r\nevents of the last year show that it is the right road to peace.\r\n\r\nWe cannot expect to complete the job overnight. The free nations may have\r\nto maintain for years the larger military forces needed to deter\r\naggression. We must build steadily, over a period of years, toward\r\npolitical solidarity and economic progress among the free nations in all\r\nparts of the world.\r\n\r\nOur task will not be easy; but if we go at it with a will, we can look\r\nforward to steady progress. On our side are all the great resources of\r\nfreedom--the ideals of religion and democracy, the aspiration of people for\r\na better life, and the industrial and technical power of a free\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nThese advantages outweigh anything the slave world can produce. The only\r\nthing that can defeat us is our own state of mind. We can lose if we\r\nfalter.\r\n\r\nThe middle period of a great national effort like this is a very difficult\r\ntime. The way seems long and hard. The goal seems far distant. Some people\r\nget discouraged. That is only natural.\r\n\r\nBut if there are any among us who think we ought to ease up in the fight\r\nfor peace, I want to remind them of three things--just three things.\r\n\r\nFirst: The threat of world war is still very real. We had one Pearl\r\nHarbor--let's not get caught off guard again. If you don't think the threat\r\nof Communist armies is real, talk to some of our men back from Korea.\r\n\r\nSecond: If the United States had to try to stand alone against a\r\nSoviet-dominated world, it would destroy the life we know and the ideals we\r\nhold dear. Our allies are essential to us, just as we are essential to\r\nthem. The more shoulders there are to bear the burden the lighter that\r\nburden will be.\r\n\r\nThird: The things we believe in most deeply are under relentless attack. We\r\nhave the great responsibility of saving the basic moral and spiritual\r\nvalues of our civilization. We have started out well--with a program for\r\npeace that is unparalleled in history. If we believe in ourselves and the\r\nfaith we profess, we will stick to that job until it is victoriously\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\nThis is a time for courage, not for grumbling and mumbling.\r\n\r\nNow, let us take a look at the things we have to do.\r\n\r\nThe thing that is uppermost in the minds of all of us is the situation in\r\nKorea. We must, and we will, keep up the fight there until we get the kind\r\nof armistice that will put an end to the aggression and protect the safety\r\nof our forces and the security of the Republic of Korea. Beyond that we\r\nshall continue to work for a settlement in Korea that upholds the\r\nprinciples of the United Nations.\r\n\r\nWe went into Korea because we knew that Communist aggression had to be met\r\nfirmly if freedom was to be preserved in the world. We went into the fight\r\nto save the Republic of Korea, a free country, established under the United\r\nNations. These are our aims. We will not give up until we attain them.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, we must continue to strengthen the forces of freedom throughout\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nI hope the Senate will take early and favorable action on the Japanese\r\npeace treaty, on our security pacts with the Pacific countries, and on the\r\nagreement to bring Greece and Turkey into the North Atlantic Treaty.\r\n\r\nWe are also negotiating an agreement with the German Federal Republic under\r\nwhich it can play an honorable and equal part among nations and take its\r\nplace in the defense of Western Europe.\r\n\r\nBut treaties and plans are only the skeleton of our defense structure. The\r\nsinew and muscle of defense are the forces and equipment which must be\r\nprovided.\r\n\r\nIn Europe we must go on helping our friends and allies to build up their\r\nmilitary forces. This means we must send weapons in large volume to our\r\nEuropean allies. I have directed that weapons for Europe be given a very\r\nhigh priority. Economic aid is necessary, too, to supply the margin of\r\ndifference between success and failure in making Europe a strong partner in\r\nour joint defense.\r\n\r\nIn the long run we want to see Europe freed from any dependence on our aid.\r\nOur European allies want that just as bad as we do. The steps that are now\r\nbeing taken to build European unity should help bring that about. Six\r\nEuropean countries are pooling their coal and steel production under the\r\nSchuman plan. Work is going forward on the merger of European national\r\nforces on the Continent into a single army. These great projects should\r\nbecome realities in 1952.\r\n\r\nWe should do all we can to help and encourage the move toward a strong and\r\nunited Europe.\r\n\r\nIn Asia the new Communist empire is a daily threat to millions of people.\r\nThe peoples of Asia want to be free to follow their own way of life. They\r\nwant to preserve their culture and their traditions against communism, just\r\nas much as we want to preserve ours. They are laboring under terrific\r\nhandicaps--poverty, ill health, feudal systems of land ownership, and the\r\nthreat of internal subversion or external attack. We can and we must\r\nincrease our help to them.\r\n\r\nThis means military aid, especially to those places like Indochina which\r\nmight be hardest hit by some new Communist attack.\r\n\r\nIt also means economic aid, both technical know-how and capital\r\ninvestment.\r\n\r\nThis last year we made available millions of bushels of wheat to relieve\r\nfamine in India. But far more important, in the long run, is the work\r\nAmericans are doing in India to help the Indian farmers themselves raise\r\nmore grain. With the help of our technicians, Indian farmers, using simple,\r\ninexpensive means, have been able since 1948 to double the crops in one\r\narea in India. One farmer there raised 63 bushels of wheat to the acre,\r\nwhere 13 bushels had been the average before.\r\n\r\nThis is point 4--our point 4 program at work. It is working--not only in\r\nIndia but in Iran, Paraguay, Liberia--in 33 countries around the globe. Our\r\ntechnical missionaries are out there. We need more of them. We need more\r\nfunds to speed their efforts, because there is nothing of greater\r\nimportance in all our foreign policy. There is nothing that shows more\r\nclearly what we stand for, and what we want to achieve.\r\n\r\nMy friends of the Congress, less than one-third of the expenditure for the\r\ncost of World War II would have created the developments necessary to feed\r\nthe whole world so we wouldn't have to stomach communism. That is what we\r\nhave got to fight, and unless we fight that battle and win it, we can't win\r\nthe cold war or a hot one either.\r\n\r\nWe have recently lost a great public servant who was leading this effort to\r\nbring opportunity and hope to the people of half the world. Dr. Henry\r\nBennett and his associates died in line of duty on a point 4 mission. It is\r\nup to us to carry on the great work for which they gave their lives.\r\n\r\nDuring the coming year we must not forget the suffering of the people who\r\nlive behind the Iron Curtain. In those areas minorities are being\r\noppressed, human rights violated, religions persecuted. We should continue\r\nto expose those wrongs. We should continue and expand the activities of the\r\nVoice of America, which brings our message of hope and truth to those\r\npeoples and other peoples throughout the world.\r\n\r\nI have just had an opportunity to discuss many of these world problems with\r\nPrime Minister Churchill. We have had a most satisfactory series of\r\nmeetings. We thoroughly reviewed the situation in Europe, the Middle East,\r\nand the Far East. We both look forward to steady progress toward peace\r\nthrough the cooperative action and teamwork of the free nations.\r\n\r\nTurning from our foreign policies, let us consider the jobs we have here at\r\nhome as a part of our program for peace.\r\n\r\nThe first of these jobs is to move ahead full steam on the defense\r\nprogram.\r\n\r\nOur objective is to have a well-equipped active defense force large\r\nenough--in concert with the forces of our allies--to deter aggression and\r\nto inflict punishing losses on the enemy immediately if we should be\r\nattacked. This active force must be backed by adequate reserves, and by the\r\nplants and tools to turn out the tremendous quantities of new weapons that\r\nwould be needed if war came. We are not building an active force adequate\r\nto carry on full scale war, but we are putting ourselves in a position to\r\nmobilize very rapidly if we have to.\r\n\r\nThis year I shall recommend some increases in the size of the active force\r\nwe are building, with particular emphasis on air power. This means we shall\r\nhave to continue large-scale production of planes and other equipment for a\r\nlonger period of time than we had originally planned.\r\n\r\nPlanes and tanks and other weapons-what the military call \"hard goods\"--are\r\nnow beginning to come off the production lines in volume. Deliveries of\r\nhard goods now amount to about a billion and a half dollars worth a month.\r\nA year from now, we expect that rate to be doubled.\r\n\r\nWe shall have to hold to a high rate of military output for about a year\r\nafter that. In 1954 we hope to have enough equipment so that we can reduce\r\nthe production of most military items substantially. The next 2 years\r\nshould therefore be the peak period of defense production.\r\n\r\nDefense needs will take a lot of steel, aluminum, copper, nickel, and other\r\nscarce materials. This means smaller production of some civilian goods. The\r\ncutbacks will be nothing like those during World War II, when most civilian\r\nproduction was completely stopped. But there will be considerably less of\r\nsome goods than we have been used to these past 2 or 3 years.\r\n\r\nThe very critical part of our defense job this year is to keep down\r\ninflation.\r\n\r\nWe can control inflation if we make up our minds to do it.\r\n\r\nOn the executive side of the Government, we intend to hold the line on\r\nprices just as tightly as the law allows. We will permit only those wage\r\nincreases which are clearly justified under sound stabilization policies;\r\nand we will see to it that industries absorb cost increases out of earnings\r\nwherever feasible, before they are authorized to raise prices. We will do\r\nthat, at any rate, except where the recent amendments to the law\r\nspecifically require us to give further price increases.\r\n\r\nCongress has a tremendous responsibility in this matter. Our stabilization\r\nlaw was shot full of holes at the last session. This year, it will be one\r\nof the main tasks before the Congress to repair the damage and enact a\r\nstrong anti-inflation law.\r\n\r\nAs a part of our program to keep our country strong, we are determined to\r\npreserve the financial strength of the Government. This means high taxes\r\nover the next few years. We must see to it that these taxes are shared\r\namong the people as fairly as possible. I expect to discuss these matters\r\nin the Economic Report and the Budget Message which will soon be presented\r\nto the Congress.\r\n\r\nOur tax laws must be fair. And we must make absolutely certain they are\r\nadministered fairly, without fear or favor of any kind for anybody. To this\r\nend, steps have already been taken to remedy weaknesses which have been\r\ndisclosed in the administration of the tax laws. In addition, I hope the\r\nCongress will approve my reorganization plan for the Bureau of Internal\r\nRevenue. We must do everything necessary in order to make just as certain\r\nas is humanly possible that every taxpayer receives equal treatment under\r\nthe law.\r\n\r\nTo carry the burden of defense we must have a strong, productive, and\r\nexpanding economy here at home. We cannot neglect those things that have\r\nmade us the great and powerful nation we are today.\r\n\r\nOur strength depends upon the health, the morale, the freedom of our\r\npeople. We can take on the burden of leadership in the fight for world\r\npeace because, for nearly 20 years, the Government and the people have been\r\nworking together for the general welfare. We have given more and more of\r\nout citizens a fair chance at decent, useful, productive lives. That is the\r\nreason we are as strong as we are today.\r\n\r\nThis Government of ours--the Congress and the executive both--must keep on\r\nworking to bring about a fair deal for all the American people. Some people\r\nwill say that we haven't the time or the money this year for measures for\r\nthe welfare of the people. But if we want to win the fight for peace, this\r\nis a part of the job we cannot ignore.\r\n\r\nWe will have to give up some things, we will have to go forward on others\r\nat a slower pace. But, so far as I am concerned, I do not think we can give\r\nup the things that are vital to our national strength.\r\n\r\nI believe most people in this country will agree with me on that.\r\n\r\nI think most farmers understand that soil conservation and rural\r\nelectrification and agricultural research are not frills or luxuries, but\r\nreal necessities in order to boost our farm production.\r\n\r\nI think most workers understand that decent housing and good working\r\nconditions are not luxuries, but necessities if the working men and women\r\nof this country are to continue to out-produce the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nI think our businessmen know that scientific research and transportation\r\nservices and more steel mills and power projects are not luxuries, but\r\nnecessities to keep our business and our industry in the forefront of\r\nindustrial progress.\r\n\r\nI think everybody knows that social insurance and better schools and health\r\nservices are not frills, but necessities in helping all Americans to be\r\nuseful and productive citizens, who can contribute their full share in the\r\nnational effort to protect and advance our way of life.\r\n\r\nWe cannot do all we want to in times like these--we have to choose the\r\nthings that will contribute most to defense--but we must continue to make\r\nprogress if we are to be a strong nation in the years ahead.\r\n\r\nLet me give you some examples.\r\n\r\nWe are going right ahead with the urgently needed work to develop our\r\nnatural resources, to conserve our soil, and to prevent floods. We are\r\ngoing to produce essential power and build the lines that are necessary and\r\nthat we have to have to transmit it to our farms and factories. We are\r\ngoing to encourage exploration for new mineral deposits.\r\n\r\nWe are going to keep on building essential highways and taking any other\r\nsteps that will assure the Nation an adequate transportation system--on\r\nland, on the sea, and in the air.\r\n\r\nWe must move right ahead this year to see that defense workers and\r\nsoldiers' families get decent housing at rents they can afford to pay.\r\n\r\nWe must begin our long deferred program of Federal aid to education--to\r\nhelp the States meet the present crisis in the operation of our schools.\r\nAnd we must help with the construction of schools in areas where they are\r\ncritically needed because of the defense effort.\r\n\r\nWe urgently need to train more doctors and other health personnel, through\r\naid to medical education. We also urgently need to expand the basic public\r\nhealth services in our home communities--especially in defense areas. The\r\nCongress should go ahead with these two measures immediately.\r\n\r\nI have set up an impartial commission to make a thorough study of the\r\nNation's health needs. One of the things this commission is looking into is\r\nhow to bring the cost of modern medical care within the reach of all the\r\npeople. I have repeatedly recommended national health insurance as the best\r\nway to do this. So far as I know, it is still the best way. If there are\r\nany better answers, I hope this commission will find them. But of one thing\r\nI am sure: something must be done, and done soon.\r\n\r\nThis year we ought to make a number of urgently needed improvements in our\r\nsocial security law. For one thing, benefits under old-age and survivors\r\ninsurance should be raised $5 a month above the present average of $42. For\r\nanother thing, the States should be given special aid to help them increase\r\npublic assistance payments. By doing these things now, we can ease the\r\npressure of living costs for people who depend on those fixed payments.\r\n\r\nWe should also make some cost-of-living adjustments for those receiving\r\nveterans' compensation for death or disability incurred in the service of\r\nour country. In addition, now is the time to start a sensible program of\r\nreadjustment benefits for our veterans who have seen service since the\r\nfighting broke out in Korea.\r\n\r\nAnother thing the Congress should do at this session is to strengthen our\r\nsystem of farm price supports to meet the defense emergency. The \"sliding\r\nscale\" in the price support law should not be allowed to penalize farmers\r\nfor increasing production to meet defense needs. We should also find a new\r\nand less costly method for supporting perishable commodities than the law\r\nnow provides.\r\n\r\nWe need to act promptly to improve our labor law. The Taft-Hartley Act has\r\nmany serious and far-reaching defects. Experience has demonstrated this so\r\nclearly that even the sponsors of the act now admit that it needs to be\r\nchanged. A fair law, fair to both management and labor, is indispensable to\r\nsound labor relations and to full, uninterrupted production. I intend to\r\nkeep on working for a fair law until we get one.\r\n\r\nAs we build our strength to defend the freedom in the world, we ourselves\r\nmust extend the benefits of freedom more widely among all our own people.\r\nWe need to take action toward the wider enjoyment of civil rights. Freedom\r\nis the birthright of every American.\r\n\r\nThe executive branch has been making real progress toward full equality of\r\ntreatment and opportunity--in the Armed Forces, in the civil service, and\r\nin private firms working for the Government. Further advances require\r\naction by Congress, and I hope that means will be provided to give the\r\nMembers of the Senate and the House a chance to vote on them.\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear that home rule for the District of Columbia will be the\r\nfirst item of business before the Senate. I hope that it, as well as\r\nstatehood for Hawaii and Alaska, will be adopted promptly.\r\n\r\nAll these measures I have been talking about--measures to advance the\r\nwell-being of our people--demonstrate to the world the forward movement of\r\nour free society.\r\n\r\nThis demonstration of the way free men govern themselves has a more\r\npowerful influence on the people of the world--on both sides of the Iron\r\nCurtain--than all the trick slogans and pie-in-the-sky promises of the\r\nCommunists.\r\n\r\nBut our shortcomings, as well as our progress, are watched from abroad. And\r\nthere is one shortcoming I want to speak about plainly.\r\n\r\nOur kind of government above all others cannot tolerate dishonesty among\r\npublic servants.\r\n\r\nSome dishonest people worm themselves into almost every human organization.\r\nIt is all the more shocking, however, when they make their way into a\r\nGovernment such as ours, which is based on the principle of justice for\r\nall. Such unworthy public servants must be weeded out. I intend to see to\r\nit that Federal employees who have been guilty of misconduct are punished\r\nfor it. I also intend to see to it that the honest and hard-working great\r\nmajority of our Federal employees are protected against partisan slander\r\nand malicious attack.\r\n\r\nI have already made some recommendations to the Congress to help accomplish\r\nthese purposes. I intend to submit further recommendations to this end. I\r\nwill welcome the wholehearted cooperation of the Congress in this effort.\r\n\r\nI also think that the Congress can do a great deal to strengthen confidence\r\nin our institutions by applying rigorous standards of moral integrity to\r\nits own operations, and by finding an effective way to control campaign\r\nexpenditures, and by protecting the rights of individuals in congressional\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\nTo meet the crisis which now hangs over the world, we need many different\r\nkinds of strength--military, economic, political, and moral. And of all\r\nthese, I am convinced that moral strength is the most vital.\r\n\r\nWhen you come right down to it, it is the courage and the character of our\r\nNation--and of each one of us as individuals-that will really decide how\r\nwell we meet this challenge.\r\n\r\nWe are engaged in a great undertaking at home and abroad--the greatest, in\r\nfact, that any nation has ever been privileged to embark upon. We are\r\nworking night and day to bring peace to the world and to spread the\r\ndemocratic ideals of justice and self-government to all people. Our\r\naccomplishments are already remarkable. We ought to be full of pride in\r\nwhat we are doing, and full of confidence and hope in the outcome. No\r\nnation ever had greater resources, or greater energy, or nobler traditions\r\nto inspire it.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, day in and day out, we see a long procession of timid and fearful\r\nmen who wring their hands and cry out that we have lost the way, that we\r\ndon't know what we are doing, that we are bound to fail. Some say we should\r\ngive up the struggle for peace, and others say we should have a war and get\r\nit over with. That's a terrible statement. I had heard it made, but they\r\nwant us to forget the great objective of preventing another world war--the\r\nobjective for which our soldiers have been fighting in the hills of Korea.\r\n\r\nIf we are to be worthy of all that has been done for us by our soldiers in\r\nthe field, we must be true to the ideals for which they are fighting. We\r\nmust reject the counsels of defeat and despair. We must have the\r\ndetermination to complete the great work for which our men have laid down\r\ntheir lives.\r\n\r\nIn all we do, we should remember who we are and what we stand for. We are\r\nAmericans. Our forefathers had far greater obstacles than we have, and much\r\npoorer chances of success. They did not lose heart, or turn aside from\r\ntheir goals. In the darkest of all winters in American history, at Valley\r\nForge, George Washington said: \"We must not, in so great a contest, expect\r\nto meet with nothing but sunshine.\" With that spirit they won their fight\r\nfor freedom.\r\n\r\nWe must have that same faith and vision. In the great contest in which we\r\nare engaged today, we cannot expect to have fair weather all the way. But\r\nit is a contest just as important for this country and for all men, as the\r\ndesperate struggle that George Washington fought through to victory.\r\n\r\nLet us prove, again, that we are not merely sunshine patriots and summer\r\nsoldiers. Let us go forward, trusting in the God of Peace, to win the goals\r\nwe seek.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nHarry S. Truman\r\nJanuary 7, 1953\r\n\r\nTo the Congress of the United States:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to report to the Congress on the state of the Union.\r\n\r\nThis is the eighth such report that, as President, I have been privileged\r\nto present to you and to the country. On previous occasions, it has been my\r\ncustom to set forth proposals for legislative action in the coming year.\r\nBut that is not my purpose today. The presentation of a legislative program\r\nfalls properly to my successor, not to me, and I would not infringe upon\r\nhis responsibility to chart the forward course. Instead, I wish to speak of\r\nthe course we have been following the past eight years and the position at\r\nwhich we have arrived.\r\n\r\nIn just two weeks, General Eisenhower will be inaugurated as President of\r\nthe United States and I will resume--most gladly--my place as a private\r\ncitizen of this Republic. The Presidency last changed hands eight years ago\r\nthis coming April. That was a tragic time: a time of grieving for President\r\nRoosevelt--the great and gallant human being who had been taken from us; a\r\ntime of unrelieved anxiety to his successor, thrust so suddenly into the\r\ncomplexities and burdens of the Presidential office.\r\n\r\nNot so this time. This time we see the normal transition under our\r\ndemocratic system. One President, at the conclusion of his term, steps back\r\nto private life; his successor, chosen by the people, begins his tenure of\r\nthe office. And the Presidency of the United States continues to function\r\nwithout a moment's break.\r\n\r\nSince the election, I have done my best to assure that the transfer from\r\none Administration to another shall be smooth and orderly. From General\r\nEisenhower and his associates, I have had friendly and understanding\r\ncollaboration in this endeavor. I have not sought to thrust upon him--nor\r\nhas he sought to take--the responsibility which must be mine until twelve\r\no'clock noon on January twentieth. But together, I hope and believe we have\r\nfound means whereby the incoming President can obtain the full and detailed\r\ninformation he will need to assume the responsibility the moment he takes\r\nthe oath of office.\r\n\r\nThe President-elect is about to take up the greatest burdens, the most\r\ncompelling responsibilities, given to any man. And I, with you and all\r\nAmericans, wish for him all possible success in undertaking the tasks that\r\nwill so soon be his.\r\n\r\nWhat are these tasks? The President is Chief of State, elected\r\nrepresentative of all the people, national spokesman for them and to them.\r\nHe is Commander-in-Chief of our armed forces. He is charged with the\r\nconduct of our foreign relations. He is Chief Executive of the Nation's\r\nlargest civilian organization. He must select and nominate all top\r\nofficials of the Executive Branch and all Federal judges. And on the\r\nlegislative side, he has the obligation and the opportunity to recommend,\r\nand to approve or veto legislation. Besides all this, it is to him that a\r\ngreat political party turns naturally for leadership, and that, too, he\r\nmust provide as President.\r\n\r\nThis bundle of burdens is unique; there is nothing else like it on the face\r\nof the earth. Each task could be a full-time job. Together, they would be a\r\ntremendous undertaking in the easiest of times.\r\n\r\nBut our times are not easy; they are hard-as hard and complex, perhaps as\r\nany in our history. Now, the President not only has to carry on these tasks\r\nin such a way that our democracy may grow and flourish and our people\r\nprosper, but he also has to lead the whole free world in overcoming the\r\ncommunist menace--and all this under the shadow of the atomic bomb.\r\n\r\nThis is a huge challenge to the human being who occupies the Presidential\r\noffice. But it is not a challenge to him alone, for in reality he cannot\r\nmeet it alone. The challenge runs not just to him but to his whole\r\nAdministration, to the Congress, to the country.\r\n\r\nUltimately, no President can master his responsibilities, save as his\r\nfellow citizens-indeed, the whole people--comprehend the challenge of our\r\ntimes and move, with him, to meet it.\r\n\r\nIt has been my privilege to hold the Presidential office for nearly eight\r\nyears now, and much has been done in which I take great pride. But this is\r\nnot personal pride. It is pride in the people, in the Nation. It is pride\r\nin our political system and our form of government--balky sometimes,\r\nmechanically deficient perhaps, in many ways--but enormously alive and\r\nvigorous; able through these years to keep the Republic on the right\r\ncourse, rising to the great occasions, accomplishing the essentials,\r\nmeeting the basic challenge of our times.\r\n\r\nThere have been misunderstandings and controversies these past eight years,\r\nbut through it all the President of the United States has had that measure\r\nof support and understanding without which no man could sustain the burdens\r\nof the Presidential office, or hope to discharge its responsibilities.\r\n\r\nFor this I am profoundly grateful--grateful to my associates in the\r\nExecutive Branch--most of them non-partisan civil servants;\r\ngrateful--despite our disagreements-to the Members of the Congress on both\r\nsides of the aisle; grateful especially to the American people, the\r\ncitizens of this Republic, governors of us all.\r\n\r\nWe are still so close to recent controversies that some of us may find it\r\nhard to understand the accomplishments of these past eight years. But the\r\naccomplishments are real and very great, not as the President's, not as the\r\nCongress', but as the achievements of our country and all the people in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nLet me remind you of some of the things we have done since I first assumed\r\nmy duties as President of the United States.\r\n\r\nI took the oath of office on April 12, 1945. In May of that same year, the\r\nNazis surrendered. Then, in July, that great white flash of light, man-made\r\nat Alamogordo, heralded swift and final victory in World War II--and opened\r\nthe doorway to the atomic age.\r\n\r\nConsider some of the great questions that were posed for us by sudden,\r\ntotal victory in World War II. Consider also, how well we as a Nation have\r\nresponded.\r\n\r\nWould the American economy collapse, after the war? That was one question.\r\nWould there be another depression here--a repetition of 1921 or 1929? The\r\nfree world feared and dreaded it. The communists hoped for it and built\r\ntheir policies upon that hope.\r\n\r\nWe answered that question--answered it with a resounding \"no.\"\r\n\r\nOur economy has grown tremendously. Free enterprise has flourished as never\r\nfore. Sixty-two million people are now gainfully employed, compared with 51\r\nmillion seven years ago. Private businessmen and farmers have invested more\r\nthan 200 billion dollars in new plant and equipment since the end of World\r\nWar II. Prices have risen further than they should have done--but incomes,\r\nby and large, have risen even more, so that real living standards are now\r\nconsiderably higher than seven years ago. Aided by sound government\r\npolicies, our expanding economy has shown the strength and flexibility for\r\nswift and almost painless reconversion from war to peace, in 1945 and 1946;\r\nfor quick reaction and recovery--well before Korea--from the beginnings of\r\nrecession in 1949. Above all, this live and vital economy of ours has now\r\nshown the remarkable capacity to sustain a great mobilization program for\r\ndefense, a vast outpouring of aid to friends and allies all around the\r\nworld--and still to produce more goods and services for peaceful use at\r\nhome than we have ever known before.\r\n\r\nThis has been our answer, up to now, to those who feared or hoped for a\r\ndepression in this country.\r\n\r\nHow have we handled our national finances? That was another question\r\narising at war's end. In the administration of the Government, no problem\r\ntakes more of the President's time, year in and year out, than fashioning\r\nthe Budget, and the related problem of managing the public debt.\r\n\r\nFinancing World War II left us with a tremendous public debt, which reached\r\n279 billion dollars at its peak in February, 1946.\r\n\r\nBeginning in July, 1946, when war and reconversion financing had ended, we\r\nhave held quite closely to the sound standard that in times of high\r\nemployment and high national income, the Federal Budget should be balanced\r\nand the debt reduced.\r\n\r\nFor the four fiscal years from July 1, 1946, to June 30, 1950, we had a net\r\nsurplus of 4.3 billion dollars. Using this surplus, and the Treasury's\r\nexcess cash reserves, the debt was reduced substantially, reaching a low\r\npoint of 251 billion dollars in June, 1949, and ending up at 257 billion\r\ndollars on June 30, 1950.\r\n\r\nIn July of 1950, we began our rapid rearmament, and for two years held very\r\nclose to a pay-as-we-go policy. But in the current fiscal year and the\r\nnext, rising expenditures for defense will substantially outrun receipts.\r\nThis will pose an immediate and serious problem for the new Congress.\r\n\r\nNow let me turn to another question we faced at the war's end. Would we\r\ntake up again, and carry forward, the great projects of social welfare--so\r\nbadly needed, so long overdue--that the New Deal had introduced into our\r\nnational life? Would our Government continue to have a heart for the\r\npeople, or was the progress of the New Deal to be halted in the aftermath\r\nof war as decisively as the progress of Woodrow Wilson's New Freedom had\r\nbeen halted after the first world war?\r\n\r\nThis question, too, we have answered. We have answered it by doubling old\r\nage insurance benefits and extending coverage to ten million more people.\r\nWe have answered it by increasing our minimum wage. We have answered by the\r\nthree million privately constructed homes that the Federal Government has\r\nhelped finance since the war--and the 155 thousand units of low rent public\r\nhousing placed under construction since 1949.\r\n\r\nWe have answered with the 42 thousand new hospital beds provided since 1946\r\nthrough the joint efforts of the Federal Government and local communities.\r\n\r\nWe have answered by helping eight million veterans of World War II to\r\nobtain advanced education, 196 thousand to start in business, and 64\r\nthousand to buy farms.\r\n\r\nWe have answered by continuing to help farmers obtain electric power, until\r\ntoday nearly 90 per cent of our farms have power line electric service.\r\n\r\nIn these and other ways, we have demonstrated, up to now, that our\r\ndemocracy has not forgotten how to use the powers of the Government to\r\npromote the people's welfare and security.\r\n\r\nAnother of the big post-war questions was this: What we would do with the\r\nNation's natural resources--its soils and water, forests and grasslands.\r\nWould we continue the strong conservation movement of the 1930's, or would\r\nwe, as we did after the First World War, slip back into the practices of\r\nmonopoly, exploitation, and waste?\r\n\r\nThe answer is plain. All across our country, the soil conservation movement\r\nhas spread, aided by Government programs, enriching private and public\r\nlands, preserving them from destruction, improving them for future use. In\r\nour river basins, we have invested nearly 5 billion dollars of public funds\r\nin the last eight years--invested them in projects to control floods,\r\nirrigate farmlands, produce low-cost power and get it to the housewives and\r\nfarmers and businessmen who need it. We have been vigilant in protecting\r\nthe people's property--lands and forests and oil and minerals.\r\n\r\nWe have had to fight hard against those who would use our resources for\r\nprivate greed; we have met setbacks; we have had to delay work because of\r\ndefense priorities, but on the whole we can be proud of our record in\r\nprotecting our natural heritage, and in using our resources for the public\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nHere is another question we had to face at the war's close: Would we\r\ncontinue, in peace as well as war, to promote equality of opportunity for\r\nall our citizens, seeking ways and means to guarantee for all of them the\r\nfull enjoyment of their civil rights?\r\n\r\nDuring the war we achieved great economic and social gains for millions of\r\nour fellow citizens who had been held back by prejudice. Were we prepared,\r\nin peacetime, to keep on moving toward full realization of the democratic\r\npromise? Or would we let it be submerged, wiped out, in post-war riots and\r\nreaction, as after World War I?\r\n\r\nWe answered these questions in a series of forward steps at every level of\r\ngovernment and in many spheres of private life. In our armed forces, our\r\ncivil service, our universities, our railway trains, the residential\r\ndistricts of our cities--in stores and factories all across the Nation--in\r\nthe polling booths as well--the barriers are coming down. This is\r\nhappening, in part, at the mandate of the courts; in part, at the\r\ninsistence of Federal, State and local governments; in part, through the\r\nenlightened action of private groups and persons in every region and every\r\nwalk of life.\r\n\r\nThere has been a great awakening of the American conscience on the issues\r\nof civil rights. And all this progress--still far from complete but still\r\ncontinuing--has been our answer, up to now, to those who questioned our\r\nintention to live up to the promises of equal freedom for us all.\r\n\r\nThere was another question posed for us at the war's end, which equally\r\nconcerned the future course of our democracy: Could the machinery of\r\ngovernment and politics in this Republic be changed, improved, adapted\r\nrapidly enough to carry through, responsibly and well, the vast, new\r\ncomplicated undertakings called for in our time?\r\n\r\nWe have answered this question, too, answered it by tackling the most\r\nurgent, most specific, problems which the war experience itself had brought\r\ninto sharp focus. The reorganization of the Congress in 1946; the\r\nunification of our armed services, beginning in 1947; the closer\r\nintegration of foreign and military policy through the National Security\r\nCouncil created that same year; and the Executive reorganizations, before\r\nand after the Hoover-Acheson Commission Report in 1949--these are landmarks\r\nin our continuing endeavor to make government an effective instrument of\r\nservice to the people.\r\n\r\nI come now to the most vital question of all, the greatest of our concerns:\r\nCould there be built in the world a durable structure of security, a\r\nlasting peace for all the nations, or would we drift, as after World War I,\r\ntoward another terrible disaster--a disaster which this time might be the\r\nholocaust of atomic war?\r\n\r\nThat is still the overriding question of our time. We cannot know the\r\nanswer yet; perhaps we will not know it finally for a long time to come.\r\nBut day and night, these past eight years, we have been building for peace,\r\nsearching out the way that leads most surely to security and freedom and\r\njustice in the world for us and all mankind.\r\n\r\nThis, above all else, has been the task of our Republic since the end of\r\nWorld War II, and our accomplishment so far should give real pride to all\r\nAmericans. At the very least, a total war has been averted, each day up to\r\nthis hour. And at the most, we may already have succeeded in establishing\r\nconditions which can keep that kind of war from happening, for as far ahead\r\nas man can see.\r\n\r\nThe Second World War radically changed the power relationships of the\r\nworld. Nations once great were left shattered and weak, channels of\r\ncommunication, routes of trade, political and economic ties of many kinds\r\nwere ripped apart.\r\n\r\nAnd in this changed, disrupted, chaotic situation, the United States and\r\nthe Soviet Union emerged as the two strongest powers of the world. Each had\r\ntremendous human and natural resources, actual or potential, on a scale\r\nunmatched by any other nation.\r\n\r\nNothing could make plainer why the world is in its present state--and how\r\nthat came to pass--than an understanding of the diametrically opposite\r\nprinciples and policies of these two great powers in a war-ruined world.\r\n\r\nFor our part, we in this Republic were-and are--free men, heirs of the\r\nAmerican Revolution, dedicated to the truths of our Declaration of\r\nIndependence:\r\n\r\n\"... That all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator\r\nwith certain unalienable rights... That to secure these rights, governments\r\nare instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of\r\nthe governed.\"\r\n\r\nOur post-war objective has been in keeping with this great idea. The United\r\nStates has sought to use its pre-eminent position of power to help other\r\nnations recover from the damage and dislocation of the war. We held out a\r\nhelping hand to enable them to restore their national lives and to regain\r\ntheir positions as independent, self-supporting members of the great family\r\nof nations. This help was given without any attempt on our part to dominate\r\nor control any nation. We did not want satellites but partners.\r\n\r\nThe Soviet Union, however, took exactly the opposite course.\r\n\r\nIts rulers saw in the weakened condition of the world not an obligation to\r\nassist in the great work of reconstruction, but an opportunity to exploit\r\nmisery and suffering for the extension of their power. Instead of help,\r\nthey brought subjugation. They extinguished, blotted out, the national\r\nindependence of the countries that the military operations of World War II\r\nhad left within their grasp.\r\n\r\nThe difference stares at us from the map of Europe today. To the west of\r\nthe line that tragically divides Europe we see nations continuing to act\r\nand live in the light of their own traditions and principles. On the other\r\nside, we see the dead uniformity of a tyrannical system imposed by the\r\nrulers of the Soviet Union. Nothing could point up more clearly what the\r\nglobal struggle between the free world and the communists is all about.\r\n\r\nIt is a struggle as old as recorded history; it is freedom versus tyranny.\r\n\r\nFor the dominant idea of the Soviet regime is the terrible conception that\r\nmen do not have rights but live at the mercy of the state.\r\n\r\nInevitably this idea of theirs--and all the consequences flowing from\r\nit--collided with the efforts of free nations to build a just and peaceful\r\nworld. The \"cold war\" between the communists and the free world is nothing\r\nmore or less than the Soviet attempt to checkmate and defeat our peaceful\r\npurposes, in furtherance of their own dread objective.\r\n\r\nWe did not seek this struggle, God forbid. We did our utmost to avoid it.\r\nIn World War II, we and the Russians had fought side by side, each in our\r\nturn attacked and forced to combat by the aggressors. After the war, we\r\nhoped that our wartime collaboration could be maintained, that the\r\nfrightful experience of Nazi invasion, of devastation in the heart of\r\nRussia, had turned the Soviet rulers away from their old proclaimed\r\nallegiance to world revolution and communist dominion. But instead, they\r\nviolated, one by one, the solemn agreements they had made with us in\r\nwartime. They sought to use the rights and privileges they had obtained in\r\nthe United Nations, to frustrate its purposes and cut down its powers as an\r\neffective agent of world progress and the keeper of the world's peace.\r\n\r\nDespite this outcome, the efforts we made toward peaceful collaboration are\r\na source of our present strength. They demonstrated that we believed what\r\nwe proclaimed, that we actually sought honest agreements as the way to\r\npeace. Our whole moral position, our leadership in the free world today, is\r\nfortified by that fact.\r\n\r\nThe world is divided, not through our fault or failure, but by Soviet\r\ndesign. They, not we, began the cold war. And because the free world saw\r\nthis happen because men know we made the effort and the Soviet rulers\r\nspurned it--the free nations have accepted leadership from our Republic, in\r\nmeeting and mastering the Soviet offensive.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me especially important that all of us be clear, in our own\r\nthinking, about the nature of the threat we have faced-and will face for a\r\nlong time to come. The measures we have devised to meet it take shape and\r\npattern only as we understand what we were--and are--up against.\r\n\r\nThe Soviet Union occupies a territory of 8 million square miles. Beyond its\r\nborders, East and West, are the nearly five million square miles of the\r\nsatellite states--virtually incorporated into the Soviet Union--and of\r\nChina, now its close partner. This vast land mass contains an enormous\r\nstore of natural resources sufficient to support an economic development\r\ncomparable to our own.\r\n\r\nThat is the Stalinist world. It is a world of great natural diversity in\r\ngeography and climate, in distribution of resources, in population,\r\nlanguage, and living standards, in economic and cultural development. It is\r\na world whose people are not all convinced communists by any means. It is a\r\nworld where history and national traditions, particularly in its\r\nborderlands, tend more toward separation than unification, and run counter\r\nto the enforced combination that has been made of these areas today.\r\n\r\nBut it is also a world of great man-made uniformities, a world that bleeds\r\nits population white to build huge military forces; a world in which the\r\npolice are everywhere and their authority unlimited; a world where terror\r\nand slavery are deliberately administered both as instruments of government\r\nand as means of production; a world where all effective social power is the\r\nstate's monopoly--yet the state itself is the creature of the communist\r\ntyrants.\r\n\r\nThe Soviet Union, with its satellites, and China are held in the tight grip\r\nof communist party chieftains. The party dominates all social and political\r\ninstitutions. The party regulates and centrally directs the whole economy.\r\nIn Moscow's sphere, and in Peiping's, all history, philosophy, morality and\r\nlaw are centrally established by rigid dogmas, incessantly drummed into the\r\nwhole population and subject to interpretation--or to change by none except\r\nthe party's own inner circle.\r\n\r\nAnd lest their people learn too much of other ways of life, the communists\r\nhave walled off their world, deliberately and uniformly, from the rest of\r\nhuman society.\r\n\r\nThat is the communist base of operation in-their cold war. In addition,\r\nthey have at their command hundreds and thousands of dedicated foreign\r\ncommunists, people in nearly every free country who will serve Moscow's\r\nends. Thus the masters of the Kremlin are provided with deluded followers\r\nall through the free world whom they can manipulate, cynically and quite\r\nruthlessly, to serve the purposes of the Soviet state.\r\n\r\nGiven their vast internal base of operations, and their agents in foreign\r\nlands, what are the communist rulers trying to do?\r\n\r\nInside their homeland, the communists are trying to maintain and modernize\r\nhuge military forces. And simultaneously, they are endeavoring to weld\r\ntheir whole vast area and population into a completely self-contained,\r\nadvanced industrial society. They aim, some day, to equal or better the\r\nproduction levels of Western Europe and North America combined--thus\r\nshifting the balance of world economic power, and war potential, to their\r\nside.\r\n\r\nThey have a long way to go and they know it. But they are prepared to levy\r\nupon living generations any sacrifice that helps strengthen their armed\r\npower, or speed industrial development.\r\n\r\nExternally, the communist rulers are trying to expand the boundaries of\r\ntheir world, whenever and wherever they can. This expansion they have\r\npursued steadfastly since the close of World War II, using any means\r\navailable to them.\r\n\r\nWhere the Soviet army was present, as in the countries of Eastern Europe,\r\nthey have gradually squeezed free institutions to death.\r\n\r\nWhere post-war chaos existed in industrialized nations, as in Western\r\nEurope, the local Stalinists tried to gain power through political\r\nprocesses, politically-inspired strikes, and every available means for\r\nsubverting free institutions to their evil ends.\r\n\r\nWhere conditions permitted, the Soviet rulers have stimulated and aided\r\narmed insurrection by communist-led revolutionary forces, as in Greece,\r\nIndo-China, the Philippines, and China, or outright aggression by one of\r\ntheir satellites, as in Korea.\r\n\r\nWhere the forces of nationalism, independence, and economic change were at\r\nwork throughout the great sweep of Asia and Africa, the communists tried to\r\nidentify themselves with the cause of progress, tried to picture themselves\r\nas the friends of freedom and advancement--surely one of the most cynical\r\nefforts of which history offers record.\r\n\r\nThus, everywhere in the free world, the communists seek to fish in troubled\r\nwaters, to seize more countries, to enslave more millions of human souls.\r\nThey were, and are, ready to ally themselves with any group, from the\r\nextreme left to the extreme right, that offers them an opportunity to\r\nadvance their ends.\r\n\r\nGeography gives them a central position. They are both a European and an\r\nAsian power, with borders touching many of the most sensitive and vital\r\nareas in the free world around them. So situated, they can use their armies\r\nand their economic power to set up simultaneously a whole series of\r\nthreats--or inducements--to such widely dispersed places as Western\r\nGermany, Iran, and Japan. These pressures and attractions can be sustained\r\nat will, or quickly shifted from place to place.\r\n\r\nThus the communist rulers are moving, with implacable will, to create\r\ngreater strength in their vast empire, and to create weakness and division\r\nin the free world, preparing for the time their false creed teaches them\r\nmust come: the time when the whole world outside their sway will be so torn\r\nby strife and contradictions that it will be ripe for the communist\r\nplucking.\r\n\r\nThis is the heart of the distorted Marxist interpretation of history. This\r\nis the glass through which Moscow and Peiping look out upon the world, the\r\nglass through which they see the rest of us. They seem really to believe\r\nthat history is on their side. And they are trying to boost \"history\"\r\nalong, at every opportunity, in every way they can.\r\n\r\nI have set forth here the nature of the communist menace confronting our\r\nRepublic and the whole free world. This is the measure of the challenge we\r\nhave faced since World War II--a challenge partly military and partly\r\neconomic, partly moral and partly intellectual, confronting us at every\r\nlevel of human endeavor and all around the world.\r\n\r\nIt has been and must be the free world's purpose not only to organize\r\ndefenses against aggression and subversion, not only to build a structure\r\nof resistance and salvation for the community of nations outside the iron\r\ncurtain, but in addition to give expression and opportunity to the forces\r\nof growth and progress in the free world, to so organize and unify the\r\ncooperative community of free men that we will not crumble but grow\r\nstronger over the years, and the Soviet empire, not the free world, will\r\neventually have to change its ways or fall.\r\n\r\nOur whole program of action to carry out this purpose has been directed to\r\nmeet two requirements.\r\n\r\nThe first of these had to do with security. Like the pioneers who settled\r\nthis great continent of ours, we have had to carry a musket while we went\r\nabout our peaceful business. We realized that if we and our allies did not\r\nhave military strength to meet the growing Soviet military threat, we would\r\nnever have the opportunity to carry forward our efforts to build a peaceful\r\nworld of law and order--the only environment in which our free institutions\r\ncould survive and flourish.\r\n\r\nDid this mean we had to drop everything else and concentrate on armies and\r\nweapons? Of course it did not: side-by-side with this urgent military\r\nrequirement, we had to continue to help create conditions of economic and\r\nsocial progress in the world. This work had to be carried forward alongside\r\nthe first, not only in order to meet the non-military aspects of the\r\ncommunist drive for power, but also because this creative effort toward\r\nhuman progress is essential to bring about the kind of world we as free men\r\nwant to live in.\r\n\r\nThese two requirements--military security and human progress--are more\r\nclosely related in action than we sometimes recognize. Military security\r\ndepends upon a strong economic underpinning and a stable and hopeful\r\npolitical order; conversely, the confidence that makes for economic and\r\npolitical progress does not thrive in areas that are vulnerable to military\r\nconquest.\r\n\r\nThese requirements are related in another way. Both of them depend upon\r\nunity of action among the free nations of the world. This, indeed, has been\r\nthe foundation of our whole effort, for the drawing together of the free\r\npeople of the world has become a condition essential not only to their\r\nprogress, but to their survival as free people.\r\n\r\nThis is the conviction that underlies all the steps we have been taking to\r\nstrengthen and unify the free nations during the past seven years.\r\n\r\nWhat have these steps been? First of all, how have we gone about meeting\r\nthe requirement of providing for our security against this world-wide\r\nchallenge?\r\n\r\nOur starting point, as I have said on many occasions, has been and remains\r\nthe United Nations.\r\n\r\nWe were prepared, and so were the other nations of the free world, to place\r\nour reliance on the machinery of the United Nations to safeguard peace. But\r\nbefore the United Nations could give full expression to the concept of\r\ninternational security embodied in the Charter, it was essential that the\r\nfive permanent members of the Security Council honor their solemn pledge to\r\ncooperate to that end. This the Soviet Union has not done.\r\n\r\nI do not need to outline here the dreary record of Soviet obstruction and\r\nveto and the unceasing efforts of the Soviet representatives to sabotage\r\nthe United Nations. It is important, however, to distinguish clearly\r\nbetween the principle of collective security embodied in the Charter and\r\nthe mechanisms of the United Nations to give that principle effect. We must\r\nfrankly recognize that the Soviet Union has been able, in certain\r\ninstances, to stall the machinery of collective security. Yet it has not\r\nbeen able to impair the principle of collective security. The free nations\r\nof the world have retained their allegiance to that idea. They have found\r\nthe means to act despite the Soviet veto, both through the United Nations\r\nitself and through the application of this principle in regional and other\r\nsecurity arrangements that are fully in harmony with the Charter and give\r\nexpression to its purposes.\r\n\r\nThe free world refused to resign itself to collective suicide merely\r\nbecause of the technicality of a Soviet veto.\r\n\r\nThe principle of collective measures to forestall aggression has found\r\nexpression in the Treaty of Rio de Janeiro, the North Atlantic Treaty, now\r\nextended to include Greece and Turkey, and the several treaties we have\r\nconcluded to reinforce security in the Pacific area.\r\n\r\nBut the free nations have not this time fallen prey to the dangerous\r\nillusion that treaties alone will stop an aggressor. By a series of\r\nvigorous actions, as varied as the nature of the threat, the free nations\r\nhave successfully thwarted aggression or the threat of aggression in many\r\ndifferent parts of the world.\r\n\r\nOur country has led or supported these collective measures. The aid we have\r\ngiven to people determined to act in defense of their freedom has often\r\nspelled the difference between success and failure.\r\n\r\nWe all know what we have done, and I shall not review in detail the steps\r\nwe have taken. Each major step was a milepost in the developing unity,\r\nstrength and resolute will of the free nations.\r\n\r\nThe first was the determined and successful effort made through the United\r\nNations to safeguard the integrity and independence of Iran in 1945 and\r\n1946.\r\n\r\nNext was our aid and support to embattled Greece, which enabled her to\r\ndefeat the forces threatening her national independence.\r\n\r\nIn Turkey, cooperative action resulted in building up a bulwark of military\r\nstrength for an area vital to the defenses of the entire free world.\r\n\r\nIn 1949, we began furnishing military aid to our partners in the North\r\nAtlantic Community and to a number of other free countries.\r\n\r\nThe Soviet Union's threats against Germany and Japan, its neighbors to the\r\nWest and to the East, have been successfully withstood. Free Germany is on\r\nits way to becoming a member of the peaceful community of nations, and a\r\npartner in the common defense. The Soviet effort to capture Berlin by\r\nblockade was thwarted by the courageous Allied airlift. An independent and\r\ndemocratic Japan has been brought back into the community of free nations.\r\n\r\nIn the Far East, the tactics of communist imperialism have reached heights\r\nof violence unmatched elsewhere--and the problem of concerted action by the\r\nfree nations has been at once more acute and more difficult.\r\n\r\nHere, in spite of outside aid and support, the free government of China\r\nsuccumbed to the communist assault. Our aid has enabled the free Chinese to\r\nrebuild and strengthen their forces on the island of Formosa. In other\r\nareas of the Far East-in Indo-China, Malaya, and the Philippines--our\r\nassistance has helped sustain a staunch resistance against communist\r\ninsurrectionary attacks.\r\n\r\nThe supreme test, up to this point, of the will and determination of the\r\nfree nations came in Korea, when communist forces invaded the Republic of\r\nKorea, a state that was in a special sense under the protection of the\r\nUnited Nations. The response was immediate and resolute. Under our military\r\nleadership, the free nations for the first time took up arms, collectively,\r\nto repel aggression.\r\n\r\nAggression was repelled, driven back, punished. Since that time, communist\r\nstrategy has seen fit to prolong the conflict, in spite of honest efforts\r\nby the United Nations to reach an honorable truce. The months of deadlock\r\nhave demonstrated that the communists cannot achieve by persistence, or by\r\ndiplomatic trickery, what they failed to achieve by sneak attack. Korea has\r\ndemonstrated that the free world has the will and the endurance to match\r\nthe communist effort to overthrow international order through local\r\naggression.\r\n\r\nIt has been a bitter struggle and it has cost us much in brave lives and\r\nhuman suffering, but it has made it plain that the free nations will fight\r\nside by side, that they will not succumb to aggression or intimidation, one\r\nby one. This, in the final analysis, is the only way to halt the communist\r\ndrive to world power.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of the free world's defense is the military strength of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nFrom 1945 to 1949, the United States was sole possessor of the atomic bomb.\r\nThat was a great deterrent and protection in itself.\r\n\r\nBut when the Soviets produced an atomic explosion--as they were bound to do\r\nin time--we had to broaden the whole basis of our strength. We had to\r\nendeavor to keep our lead in atomic weapons. We had to strengthen our armed\r\nforces generally and to enlarge our productive capacity-our mobilization\r\nbase. Historically, it was the Soviet atomic explosion in the fall of 1949,\r\nnine months before the aggression in Korea, which stimulated the planning\r\nfor our program of defense mobilization.\r\n\r\nWhat we needed was not just a central force that could strike back against\r\naggression. We also needed strength along the outer edges of the free\r\nworld, defenses for our allies as well as for ourselves, strength to hold\r\nthe line against attack as well as to retaliate.\r\n\r\nWe have made great progress on this task of building strong defenses. In\r\nthe last two and one half years, we have more than doubled our own\r\ndefenses, and we have helped to increase the protection of nearly all the\r\nother free nations.\r\n\r\nAll the measures of collective security, resistance to aggression, and the\r\nbuilding of defenses, constitute the first requirement for the survival and\r\nprogress of the free world. But, as I have pointed out, they are interwoven\r\nwith the necessity of taking steps to create and maintain economic and\r\nsocial progress in the free nations. There can be no military strength\r\nexcept where there is economic capacity to back it. There can be no freedom\r\nwhere there is economic chaos or social collapse. For these reasons, our\r\nnational policy has included a wide range of economic measures.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, the grand design of the Marshall Plan permitted the people of\r\nBritain and France and Italy and a half dozen other countries, with help\r\nfrom the United States, to lift themselves from stagnation and find again\r\nthe path of rising production, rising incomes, rising standards of living.\r\nThe situation was changed almost overnight by the Marshall Plan; the people\r\nof Europe have a renewed hope and vitality, and they are able to carry a\r\nshare of the military defense of the free world that would have been\r\nimpossible a few years ago.\r\n\r\nNow the countries of Europe are moving rapidly towards political and\r\neconomic unity, changing the map of Europe in more hopeful ways than it has\r\nbeen changed for 500 years. Customs unions, European economic institutions\r\nlike the Schuman Plan, the movement toward European political integration,\r\nthe European Defense Community-all are signs of practical and effective\r\ngrowth toward greater common strength and unity. The countries of Western\r\nEurope, including the free Republic of Germany are working together, and\r\nthe whole free world is the gainer.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens, in the course of history, that steps taken to meet an\r\nimmediate necessity serve an ultimate purpose greater than may be apparent\r\nat the time. This, I believe, is the meaning of what has been going on in\r\nEurope under the threat of aggression. The free nations there, with our\r\nhelp, have been drawing together in defense of their free institutions. In\r\nso doing, they have laid the foundations of a unity that will endure as a\r\nmajor creative force beyond the exigencies of this period of history. We\r\nmay, at this close range, be but dimly aware of the creative surge this\r\nmovement represents, but I believe it to be of historic importance. I\r\nbelieve its benefits will survive long after communist tyranny is nothing\r\nbut an unhappy memory.\r\n\r\nIn Asia and Africa, the economic and social problems are different but no\r\nless urgent. There hundreds of millions of people are in ferment, exploding\r\ninto the twentieth century, thrusting toward equality and independence and\r\nimprovement in the hard conditions of their lives.\r\n\r\nPolitically, economically, socially, things cannot and will not stay in\r\ntheir pre-war mold in Africa and Asia. Change must come--is coming--fast.\r\nJust in the years I have been President, 12 free nations, with more than\r\n600 million people, have become independent: Burma, Indonesia, the\r\nPhilippines, Korea, Israel, Libya, India, Pakistan and Ceylon, and the\r\nthree Associated States of Indo-China, now members of the French Union.\r\nThese names alone are testimony to the sweep of the great force which is\r\nchanging the face of half the world.\r\n\r\nWorking out new relationships among the peoples of the free world would not\r\nbe easy in the best of times. Even if there were no Communist drive for\r\nexpansion, there would be hard and complex problems of transition from old\r\nsocial forms, old political arrangements, old economic institutions to the\r\nnew ones our century demands--problems of guiding change into constructive\r\nchannels, of helping new nations grow strong and stable. But now, with the\r\nSoviet rulers striving to exploit this ferment for their own purposes, the\r\ntask has become harder and more urgent--terribly urgent.\r\n\r\nIn this situation, we see the meaning and the importance of the Point IV\r\nprogram, through which we can share our store of know-how and of capital to\r\nhelp these people develop their economies and reshape their societies. As\r\nwe help Iranians to raise more grain, Indians to reduce the incidence of\r\nmalaria, Liberians to educate their children better, we are at once helping\r\nto answer the desires of the people for advancement, and demonstrating the\r\nsuperiority of freedom over communism. There will be no quick solution for\r\nany of the difficulties of the new nations of Asia and Africa--but there\r\nmay be no solution at all if we do not press forward with full energy to\r\nhelp these countries grow and flourish in freedom and in cooperation with\r\nthe rest of the free world.\r\n\r\nOur measures of economic policy have already had a tremendous effect on the\r\ncourse of events. Eight years ago, the Kremlin thought post-war collapse in\r\nWestern Europe and Japan--with economic dislocation in America--might give\r\nthem the signal to advance. We demonstrated they were wrong. Now they wait\r\nwith hope that the economic recovery of the free world has set the stage\r\nfor violent and disastrous rivalry among the economically developed\r\nnations, struggling for each other's markets and a greater share of trade.\r\nHere is another test that we shall have to meet and master in the years\r\nimmediately ahead. And it will take great ingenuity and effort--and much\r\ntime--before we prove the Kremlin wrong again. But we can do it. It is true\r\nthat economic recovery presents its problems, as does economic decline, but\r\nthey are problems of another order. They are the problems of distributing\r\nabundance fairly, and they can be solved by the process of international\r\ncooperation that has already brought us so far.\r\n\r\nThese are the measures we must continue. This is the path we must follow.\r\nWe must go on, working with our free associates, building an international\r\nstructure for military defense, and for economic, social, and political\r\nprogress. We must be prepared for war, because war may be thrust upon us.\r\nBut the stakes in our search for peace are immensely higher than they have\r\never been before.\r\n\r\nFor now we have entered the atomic age, and war has undergone a\r\ntechnological change which makes it a very different thing from what it\r\nused to be. War today between the Soviet empire and the free nations might\r\ndig the grave not only of our Stalinist opponents, but of our own society,\r\nour world as well as theirs.\r\n\r\nThis transformation has been brought to pass in the seven years from\r\nAlamogordo to Eniwetok. It is only seven years, but the new force of atomic\r\nenergy has turned the world into a very different kind of place.\r\n\r\nScience and technology have worked so fast that war's new meaning may not\r\nyet be grasped by all the .peoples who would be its victims; nor, perhaps,\r\nby the rulers in the Kremlin. But I have been President of the United\r\nStates, these seven years, responsible for the decisions which have brought\r\nour science and our engineering to their present place. I know what this\r\ndevelopment means now. I know something of what it will come to mean in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nWe in this Government realized, even before the first successful atomic\r\nexplosion, that this new force spelled terrible danger for all mankind\r\nunless it were brought under international control. We promptly advanced\r\nproposals in the United Nations to take this new source of energy out of\r\nthe arena of national rivalries, to make it impossible to use it as a\r\nweapon of war. These proposals, so pregnant with benefit for all humanity,\r\nwere rebuffed by the rulers of the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nThe language of science is universal, the movement of science is always\r\nforward into the unknown. We could not assume that the Soviet Union would\r\nnot develop the same weapon, regardless of all our precautions, nor that\r\nthere were not other and even more terrible means of destruction lying in\r\nthe unexplored field of atomic energy.\r\n\r\nWe had no alternative, then, but to press on, to probe the secrets of\r\natomic power to the uttermost of our capacity, to maintain, if we could,\r\nour initial superiority in the atomic field. At the same time, we sought\r\npersistently for some avenue, some formula, for reaching an agreement with\r\nthe Soviet rulers that would place this new form of power under effective\r\nrestraints--that would guarantee no nation would use it in war. I do not\r\nhave to recount here the proposals we made, the steps taken in the United\r\nNations, striving at least to open a way to ultimate agreement. I hope and\r\nbelieve that we will continue to make these efforts so long as there is the\r\nslightest possibility of progress. All civilized nations are agreed on the\r\nurgency of the problem, and have shown their willingness to agree on\r\neffective measures of control--all save the Soviet Union and its\r\nsatellites. But they have rejected every reasonable proposal.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the progress of scientific experiment has outrun our\r\nexpectations. Atomic science is in the full tide of development; the\r\nunfolding of the innermost secrets of matter is uninterrupted and\r\nirresistible. Since Alamogordo we have developed atomic weapons with many\r\ntimes the explosive force of the early models, and we have produced them in\r\nsubstantial quantities. And recently, in the thermonuclear tests at\r\nEniwetok, we have entered another stage in the world-shaking development of\r\natomic energy. From now on, man moves into a new era of destructive power,\r\ncapable of creating explosions of a new order of magnitude, dwarfing the\r\nmushroom clouds of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\r\n\r\nWe have no reason to think that the stage we have now reached in the\r\nrelease of atomic energy will be the last. Indeed, the speed of our\r\nscientific and technical progress over the last seven years shows no signs\r\nof abating. We are being hurried forward, in our mastery of the atom, from\r\none discovery to another, toward yet unforeseeable peaks of destructive\r\npower.\r\n\r\nInevitably, until we can reach international agreement, this is the path we\r\nmust follow. And we must realize that no advance we make is unattainable by\r\nothers, that no advantage in this race can be more than temporary.\r\n\r\nThe war of the future would be one in which man could extinguish millions\r\nof lives at one blow, demolish the great cities of the world, wipe out the\r\ncultural achievements of the past--and destroy the very structure of a\r\ncivilization that has been slowly and painfully built up through hundreds\r\nof generations.\r\n\r\nSuch a war is not a possible policy for rational men. We know this, but we\r\ndare not assume that others would not yield to the temptation science is\r\nnow placing in their hands.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, there is something I would say, to Stalin: You claim\r\nbelief in Lenin's prophecy that one stage in the development of communist\r\nsociety would be war between your world and ours. But Lenin was a\r\npre-atomic man, who viewed society and history with pre-atomic eyes.\r\nSomething profound has happened since he wrote. War has changed its shape\r\nand its dimension. It cannot now be a \"stage\" in the development of\r\nanything save ruin for your regime and your homeland.\r\n\r\nI do not know how much time may elapse before the communist rulers bring\r\nthemselves to recognize this truth. But when they do, they will find us\r\neager to reach understandings that will protect the world from the danger\r\nit faces today.\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder that some people wish that we had never succeeded in\r\nsplitting the atom. But atomic power, like any other force of nature, is\r\nnot evil in itself. Properly used, it is an instrumentality for human\r\nbetterment. As a source of power, as a tool of scientific inquiry, it has\r\nuntold possibilities. We are already making good progress in the\r\nconstructive use of atomic power. We could do much more if we were free to\r\nconcentrate on its peaceful uses exclusively.\r\n\r\nAtomic power will be with us all the days of our lives. We cannot legislate\r\nit out of existence. We cannot ignore the dangers or the benefits it\r\noffers.\r\n\r\nI believe that man can harness the forces of the atom to work for the\r\nimprovement of the lot of human beings everywhere. That is our goal. As a\r\nnation, as a people, we must understand this problem, we must handle this\r\nnew force wisely through our democratic processes. Above all, we must\r\nstrive, in all earnestness and good faith, to bring it under effective\r\ninternational control. To do this will require much wisdom and patience and\r\nfirmness. The awe-inspiring responsibility in this field now falls on a new\r\nAdministration and a new Congress. I will give them my support, as I am\r\nsure all our citizens will, in whatever constructive steps they may take to\r\nmake this newest of man's discoveries a source of good and not of ultimate\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nWe cannot tell when or whether the attitude of the Soviet rulers may\r\nchange. We do not know how long it may be before they show a willingness to\r\nnegotiate effective control of atomic energy and honorable settlements of\r\nother world problems. We cannot measure how deep-rooted are the Kremlin's\r\nillusions about us. We can be sure, however, that the rulers of the\r\ncommunist world will not change their basic objectives lightly or soon.\r\n\r\nThe communist rulers have a sense of time about these things wholly unlike\r\nour own. We tend to divide our future into short spans, like the two-year\r\nlife of this Congress, or the four years of the next Presidential term.\r\nThey seem to think and plan in terms of generations. And there is,\r\ntherefore, no easy, short-run way to make them see that their plans cannot\r\nprevail.\r\n\r\nThis means there is ahead of us a long hard test of strength and stamina,\r\nbetween the free world and the communist domain-our politics and our\r\neconomy, our science and technology against the best they can do--our\r\nliberty against their slavery--our voluntary concert Of free nations\r\nagainst their forced amalgam of \"people's republics\"--our strategy against\r\ntheir strategy-our nerve against their nerve.\r\n\r\nAbove all, this is a test of the will and the steadiness of the people of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThere has been no challenge like this in the history of our Republic. We\r\nare called upon to rise to the occasion, as no people before us.\r\n\r\nWhat is required of us is not easy. The way we must learn to live, the\r\nworld we have to live in, cannot be so pleasant, safe or simple as most of\r\nus have known before, or confidently hoped to know.\r\n\r\nAlready we have had to sacrifice a number of accustomed ways of working and\r\nof living, much nervous energy, material resources, even human life. Yet if\r\none thing is certain in our future, it is that more sacrifice still lies\r\nahead.\r\n\r\nWere we to grow discouraged now, were we to weaken and slack off, the whole\r\nstructure we have built, these past eight years, would come apart and fall\r\naway. Never then, no matter by what stringent means, could our free world\r\nregain the ground, the time, the sheer momentum, lost by such a move. There\r\ncan and should be changes and improvements in our programs, to meet new\r\nsituations, serve new needs. But to desert the spirit of our basic\r\npolicies, to step back from them now, would surely start the free world's\r\nslide toward the darkness that the communists have prophesied-toward the\r\nmoment for which they watch and wait.\r\n\r\nIf we value our freedom and our way of life and want to see them safe, we\r\nmust meet the challenge and accept its implications, stick to our guns and\r\ncarry out our policies.\r\n\r\nI have set out the basic conditions, as I see them, under which we have\r\nbeen working in the world, and the nature of our basic policies. What,\r\nthen, of the future? The answer, I believe, is this: As we continue to\r\nconfound Soviet expectations, as our world grows stronger, more united,\r\nmore attractive to men on both sides of the iron curtain, then inevitably\r\nthere will come a time of change within the communist world. We do not know\r\nhow that change will come about, whether by deliberate decision in the\r\nKremlin, by coup d'etat, by revolution, by defection of satellites, or\r\nperhaps by some unforeseen combination of factors such as these.\r\n\r\nBut if the communist rulers understand they cannot win by war, and if we\r\nfrustrate their attempts to win by subversion, it is not too much to expect\r\ntheir world to change its character, moderate its aims, become more\r\nrealistic and less implacable, and recede from the cold war they began.\r\n\r\nDo not be deceived by the strong face, the look of monolithic power that\r\nthe communist dictators wear before the outside world. Remember their power\r\nhas no basis in consent. Remember they are so afraid of the free world's\r\nideas and ways of life, they do not dare to let their people know about\r\nthem. Think of the massive effort they put forth to try to stop our\r\nCampaign of Truth from reaching their people with its message of freedom.\r\n\r\nThe masters of the Kremlin live in fear their power and position would\r\ncollapse were their own people to acquire knowledge, information,\r\ncomprehension about our free society. Their world has many elements of\r\nstrength, but this one fatal flaw: the weakness represented by their iron\r\ncurtain and their police state. Surely, a social order at once so insecure\r\nand so fearful, must ultimately lose its competition with our free\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nProvided just one thing--and this I urge you to consider\r\ncarefully--provided that the free world retains the confidence and the\r\ndetermination to outmatch the best our adversary can accomplish and to\r\ndemonstrate for uncertain millions on both sides of the iron curtain the\r\nsuperiority of the free way of life.\r\n\r\nThat is the test upon all the free nations; upon none more than our own\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nOur resources are equal to the task. We have the industry, the skills, the\r\nbasic economic strength. Above all, we have the vigor of free men in a free\r\nsociety. We have our liberties. And while we keep them, while we retain our\r\ndemocratic faith, the ultimate advantage in this hard competition lies with\r\nus, not with the communists.\r\n\r\nBut there are some things that could shift the advantage to their side. One\r\nof the things that could defeat us is fear--fear of the task we face, fear\r\nof adjusting to it, fear that breeds more fear, sapping our faith,\r\ncorroding our liberties, turning citizen against citizen, ally against\r\nally. Fear could snatch away the very values we are striving to defend.\r\n\r\nAlready the danger signals have gone up. Already the corrosive process has\r\nbegun. And every diminution of our tolerance, each new act of enforced\r\nconformity, each idle accusation, each demonstration of hysteria-each new\r\nrestrictive law--is one more sign that we can lose the battle against\r\nfear.\r\n\r\nThe communists cannot deprive us of our liberties--fear can. The communists\r\ncannot stamp out our faith in human dignity-fear can. Fear is an enemy\r\nwithin ourselves, and if we do not root it out, it may destroy the very way\r\nof life we are so anxious to protect.\r\n\r\nTo beat back fear, we must hold fast to our heritage as free men. We must\r\nrenew our confidence in one another, our tolerance, our sense of being\r\nneighbors, fellow citizens. We must take our stand on the Bill of Rights.\r\nThe inquisition, the star chamber, have no place in a free society.\r\n\r\nOur ultimate strength lies, not alone in arms, but in the sense of moral\r\nvalues and moral truths that give meaning and vitality to the purposes of\r\nfree people. These values are our faith, our inspiration, the source of our\r\nstrength and our indomitable determination.\r\n\r\nWe face hard tasks, great dangers. But we are Americans and we have faced\r\nhardships and uncertainty before, we have adjusted before to changing\r\ncircumstances. Our whole history has been a steady training for the work it\r\nis now ours to do.\r\n\r\nNo one can lose heart for the task, none can lose faith in our free ways,\r\nwho stops to remember where we began, what we have sought, and what\r\naccomplished, all together as Americans.\r\n\r\nI have lived a long time and seen much happen in our country. And I know\r\nout of my own experience, that we can do what must be done.\r\n\r\nWhen I think back to the country I grew up in--and then look at what our\r\ncountry has become--I am quite certain that having done so much, we can do\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nAfter all, it has been scarcely fifteen years since most Americans rejected\r\nout-of-hand the wise counsel that aggressors must be \"quarantined\". The\r\nvery concept of collective security, the foundation-stone of all our\r\nactions now, was then strange doctrine, shunned and set aside. Talk about\r\nadapting; talk about adjusting; talk about responding as a people to the\r\nchallenge of changed times and circumstances--there has never been a more\r\nspectacular example than this great change in America's outlook on the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nLet all of us pause now, think back, consider carefully the meaning of our\r\nnational experience. Let us draw comfort from it and faith, and confidence\r\nin our future as Americans.\r\n\r\nThe Nation's business is never finished. The basic questions we have been\r\ndealing with, these eight years past, present themselves anew. That is the\r\nway of our society. Circumstances change and current questions take on\r\ndifferent forms, new complications, year by year. But underneath, the great\r\nissues remain the same--prosperity, welfare, human rights, effective\r\ndemocracy, and above all, peace.\r\n\r\nNow we turn to the inaugural of our new President. And in the great work he\r\nis called upon to do he will have need for the support of a united people,\r\na confident people, with firm faith in one another and in our common cause.\r\nI pledge him my support as a citizen of our Republic, and I ask you to give\r\nhim yours.\r\n\r\nTo him, to you, to all my fellow citizens, I say, Godspeed.\r\n\r\nMay God bless our country and our cause.",
