NO. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A FEW PRACTICAL FACTS FOR SENATOR EDMUNDS._\r\n\r\n\r\nI am a physician practising in a small manufacturing town, and am\r\ndoing very well so far as getting business goes--might even be able to\r\nsave a little money if it were not for the bad debts. They make my\r\nincome pretty small, considering the amount of hard work I am\r\ncompelled to do; and the time spent in endeavoring to collect my bills\r\ntakes a great many hours which, in justice to my patients who pay,\r\nought to be used in brushing up my medical studies and trying to keep\r\nabreast with the rest of the profession.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to get out of a warm bed at night and tramp off a mile or\r\nso to look after a patient when you are not certain of ever getting\r\nyour pay, and it seems to grow worse instead of better. The number of\r\npeople who, because of their poverty, need a doctor the most are on\r\nthe increase; and yet so long as they are not poor because of vicious\r\nhabits, one really hasn't the heart to refuse when called upon. I hear\r\na great deal said about the prosperity of the workingman and the high\r\nwages he receives, but observe as a matter of experience that only a\r\nfew are able to save enough to carry them through a few weeks'\r\nillness, let alone paying the doctor, who is forced to wait months and\r\nsometimes even years for his pay, getting it then a dollar or two at a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, some of my patients own homes of their own, but the most\r\nof them are in debt, a mortgage being about as regular an attachment\r\nto a workingman's house as a chimney.\r\n\r\nWages, too, are not quite so high as they were when I began practice:\r\nthey fell pretty low at one time, and then, when human nature could\r\nendure it no longer, came a strike. The employers were horrified;\r\nthere never had been a strike in this town before: the working men,\r\nwomen, and children all received high wages. \"There is John Smith, for\r\ninstance--earns eighty dollars a month. There is Miss Jones, who makes\r\ntwo dollars a day. There are some who earn even more.\" True enough!\r\nBut one day I was called to see John Smith lying dead on his kitchen\r\nfloor; fell dead on coming home from work, died in the harness, worked\r\nto death; a young man at that, and ought to have been good for twenty\r\nyears more. His employers wouldn't have allowed one of their horses to\r\nwork that way.\r\n\r\nI remember the first time I ever saw Miss Jones--a bright, pretty,\r\nred-cheeked girl, fresh from the country and proud to think that she\r\ncould earn her own living; to-day you would not recognize her, bent,\r\nhaggard, and worn; the rosy cheeks all gone; and the sunken chest and\r\nhollow cough too plainly prophesy the end is not far off. High wages?\r\nYes! for flesh and blood are cheap.\r\n\r\nWell, the strikers compromised, got a raise in wages of five per\r\ncent., with pay once a month instead of half at the end of the month,\r\nand the balance at the end of the year, as had been the custom. Most\r\nof the employers gave up the \"pluck-me store\" system, and we had\r\nbetter times.\r\n\r\nEvery year there comes family after family, all skilled working men\r\nand women, from over the ocean, and I begin to see men standing on the\r\nstreet corners looking for work, while every now and then one of the\r\nemployers will cut down wages a little in some department of his\r\nfactory.\r\n\r\nI see the men and boys who were born here crowded out of their places\r\nby the imported labor, leaving town, and later hear of them beginning\r\nlife over again in some western village, or taking up government lands\r\non the prairies. If it were not for the emigration out of the town,\r\nwages would scarce be enough to support life, so fast does immigration\r\nto the town keep up with the demand for labor.\r\n\r\nThe place used to be full of little shops, and the business was\r\nconducted by hundreds of small manufacturers who were but one remove\r\nfrom their men; in fact, it was no uncommon thing for a man to begin\r\nmanufacturing for himself on the savings from two or three years'\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\nBut now these small shops are used as tenements, and a dozen large\r\nfirms do nearly all the business, crowding the few small manufacturers\r\nthat are left closer and closer to the wall every year. This is\r\nbecause much of our raw stock has to be imported: we can make only a\r\nfew kinds of our class of goods in this country. The large\r\nmanufacturer, who is generally an importer also, is thus able to offer\r\na full line of goods to the jobber, which the smaller fry can't do.\r\n\r\nThe business is a highly protected industry, the people being taxed by\r\na tariff of fifty per cent to support it.\r\n\r\nIn this connection a few figures may prove instructive:\r\n\r\n  The total value of gloves manufactured during the\r\n      census year was                                  $5,718,539\r\n  For making which, labor received as wages             1,245,013 or 22%\r\n  And the raw material cost                             3,404,937\r\n  Leaving a surplus to the manufacturers of             1,068,589 or 23%\r\n  Yet their capital invested was only                   2,690,048\r\n\r\nThe tariff of fifty per cent is sufficient therefore to enable the\r\nmanufacturer to pay, not the difference in wages between European\r\nlabor and American, but _all_ the wages and twenty-eight cents on the\r\ndollar's worth of finished product besides; while--there being no\r\ntariff on labor--foreign labor comes to compete with home labor just\r\nso fast as the difference in wages will warrant the making of the\r\njourney from the old country to the new.\r\n\r\nThe tariff on gloves in an unfinished state is, however, but twenty\r\nper cent, and at that rate many gloves are imported so nearly finished\r\nas to require but little labor to fit them for the market: and here\r\nthe large dealer who imports is able to obtain another serious\r\nadvantage over the small dealer, and at the same time, while\r\npretending to protect labor, defraud it.\r\n\r\nThe closing of the small shops, and the consequent driving of our\r\npeople into large factories, hurts the best skilled workman in that it\r\nlessens the number of employers competing for his services. I have\r\nbeen a protectionist in the past, for I was taught to believe that\r\nprotection raised wages; but the results of a careful inquiry as to\r\ncause and effect have shown me pretty conclusively that it does not\r\nand can not.\r\n\r\nI have talked with many workingmen who are beginning to perceive that\r\nthe tendency of wages to fall a little from time to time is due to the\r\ncompetition of the \"pauper labor of Europe,\" which coming to this\r\ncountry, underbids them at the shop door, takes away their work, and\r\nturns them out to shift for themselves; while the employer, who is\r\nprotected by a duty of fifty per cent, gets his labor in the lowest\r\nmarket and sells his goods in the highest.\r\n\r\nSaid a glove-cutter to me the other day: \"Doctor, if all the\r\nworkingmen born and brought up here and all that have come from the\r\nold country had remained here, wages would not be fifty cents a day. I\r\nunderstand very well what keeps wages up in America: it's the great\r\nWest, with its free land acting as a safety valve; and the worst is\r\nthat so much of it has been given to railroads or sold to cattle\r\nsyndicates for a mere song. When the remaining free land is\r\nappropriated, God help the workingman!\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we're protected in all that we have to buy: food, clothing, and\r\nshelter, in a way that increases the cost to us; but in what we have\r\nto sell, our labor, we have no protection at all. They give us good\r\nwages, for if they did not we would emigrate to the West and leave\r\nthem, and by reason of this confounded tariff they put up the price of\r\nall we need so high that wages, measured by their purchasing power,\r\nare not so large after all. If the difference in real wages was so\r\ngreat as the protectionists claim, there would be more immigrants\r\ncoming from Europe in one day than do now in a year.\"\r\n\r\nThe workingmen have been educating themselves in the last four years,\r\nand are no longer to be deceived by superficial comparisons of the\r\ndifferences in wages between countries; they will also examine into\r\nthe differences in conditions, productive power, and the like, which\r\nthe protectionist statistician omits to do.\r\n\r\n                                      WILLIAM C. WOOD, M. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_IRAR'S PEARL._\r\n\r\n\r\n\"One hundred golden pieces for this slave! Who bids?--who bids?\"\r\n\r\n\"One hundred golden pieces? Surely the man has some special talent to\r\nbe valued so highly.\"\r\n\r\nThe speaker stopped, and drew near to the crowd that had gathered\r\nabout the group of captives crouched in the center of the\r\nmarket-place. As he approached, one among the gathering said:\r\n\r\n\"Room for the vizier; room, room!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the assembled people drew back on either hand, leaving a pathway\r\nclear.\r\n\r\nThe man went forward, followed by his attendants, and faced the inner\r\ngroup of the crowd, a picturesque gathering of armed Bedouins, swarthy\r\nand turbaned, clustered about a number of captives whose lighter\r\ncomplexion and free-flowing hair told of a more northern nativity, and\r\nwhich the most ready-tongued of the warriors was now loudly offering\r\nfor sale.\r\n\r\n\"One hundred golden pieces buys this slave,\" he cried again, his eye\r\nquickly noticing the interest evinced by the glance of the new-comer;\r\nan interest that his ready wit told him might be utilized to\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\n\"And why one hundred golden pieces for this man? Methinks I have seen\r\nmuch stronger knaves sold for an hundred silver pieces; and, lo! you\r\nask for gold. Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your servant is a dog if he does not answer the question to the\r\nsatisfaction of the most exacting. This man comes from the sea that\r\nlies beyond our northern mountains, and can live in the water. There\r\nis no better diver than he; why, he has brought up pebbles that were\r\nten fathoms down, and surely each fathom's depth is worth ten golden\r\npieces.\"\r\n\r\nThe speaker turned to the crowd for approval, and the affirmative nods\r\nthat greeted his appeal brought a smile of satisfaction to his dark\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"If you speak truth, you are right,\" answered the vizier. \"But where\r\nis your proof?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ask the man; he will not lie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you do what he claims for you?\" questioned the vizier, turning to\r\nthe captive.\r\n\r\nA smile of mingled scorn and contempt passed like a flash across the\r\nman's face, and then he said:\r\n\r\n\"What will it matter to me whether I can or no?\"\r\n\r\n\"This,\" answered the vizier: \"if you can, I shall purchase you for the\r\nsultan's pearl fisheries. One pearl each day makes you free for the\r\nremaining hours, and the sultan is not a hard master. I have known him\r\ngive slaves their freedom.\"\r\n\r\n\"I need no freedom, for my people are here. Shall I have food and\r\nshelter?\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke his glance swept along the faces of the captives and\r\nturned away, a bitter disappointment in it, as though it could not\r\nfind those for whom it sought.\r\n\r\n\"You will have food and shelter; yea, and garments for all needs.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can do more than he says,\" said the man.\r\n\r\n\"Then I will give the golden pieces for him. Bring him to my palace\r\nbefore the sun sets.\"\r\n\r\nAnd as the man bowed low in answer, the vizier turned and went slowly\r\ndown the street that led to the sultan's palace.\r\n\r\nThat evening his new slave lay asleep on a rug in the rose-scented\r\ncorridor of the palace, and dreamt of freedom and love all through the\r\nlong hours of the night.\r\n\r\nThe next day the vizier carried the man to the sultan's divan, and\r\nhaving told of his accomplishments, presented him to his royal master,\r\nwhose great delight was the vast hoard of pearls that burned like\r\nsmothered sunbeams in his treasury.\r\n\r\nThat same day the man was sent to the pearl fisheries on the gulf, and\r\nit was ordered that should he prove successful he was to have a house\r\nfor his special accommodation, and, on his parole of honor, be allowed\r\nthe freedom of the city and ten leagues of the adjacent country.\r\n\r\nTaken to the fisheries, he soon proved himself the master of all\r\nengaged in that dangerous work, and was quickly made the favorite of\r\nthe sultan by the brilliancy and largeness of the pearls that he\r\nfound. He was given a small house seated in the center of a garden\r\nwhere fruits and flowers commingled in fragrant profusion, and his\r\nfood and clothing were such as he himself chose, for the orders of his\r\nroyal master made his wishes in these things law.\r\n\r\nHis labor for the day was soon over, one pearl, often the result of a\r\nfive minutes' bath, made him free for the remainder of the twenty-four\r\nhours. This time he employed in reading or in taking solitary walks\r\nalong the shore of the bay opposite to that where the fisheries were\r\nlocated. Here a mass of frowning cliffs rose in dark grandeur against\r\nthe sky, and over and among these he would clamber for hours, their\r\nsteep acclivities and the wind-notes that echoed among them seeming to\r\nhave a strange fascination for him.\r\n\r\nAt last there came a rumor to the court that the sovereign of a\r\ndistant Indian realm had become possessed of a pearl whose size and\r\nbrilliancy of hue were unequalled in the world; and the sultan,\r\nhearing of this, sent an envoy to ascertain the truth of the report.\r\nThe return of this messenger confirmed the statement, and filled the\r\nsultan's soul with envy. He knew that he could not purchase the gem,\r\nbut he determined to stimulate the efforts of his fishers, and for\r\nthis purpose he caused it to be announced that any slave who should\r\nfind a pearl more brilliant and larger than that possessed by the\r\nIndian monarch should be given his freedom and one hundred thousand\r\npieces of gold.\r\n\r\nTo Irar, for such was the name by which the northern diver had elected\r\nto be known, this proclamation brought no joy. Others of the fishers\r\nmade desperate exertions to obtain the prize. He brought his daily\r\npearl and went away, basking in the sunlight of his garden, or\r\nclimbing some rough cliff that he had not scaled before.\r\n\r\nWhen questioned concerning this indifference, he smiled, a scornful\r\nand bitter light burning for an instant in his eyes, as he answered:\r\n\r\n\"Why should I desire to change my life? I have food, a home, clothing;\r\nand life can give nothing beyond these. I have no country, no friends.\r\nThe foray that brought me here swept my people from the face of the\r\nearth. My labor is light, my holidays are many. What benefits can\r\nfreedom give me?\"\r\n\r\nIf the philosophy of his questioner could find no adequate reply to\r\nthis argument, the passion that slumbered within the slave was not to\r\nbe so dumb.\r\n\r\nHe had finished his daily task, and was loitering through a shaded\r\nlane just outside of the walls of the city, when he saw approaching\r\nthe veiled form of a woman. As she came near him, the wind, that\r\nkindly agent of man, came blustering down the lane, and before the\r\nlittle brown hands could grasp the filmy white gauze that told of\r\nmaidenhood, blew it back from the face, and gave Irar a vision that no\r\ntime nor distance could efface.\r\n\r\nHe was a strongly-built and handsome fellow, young and brave, just\r\nsuch a man as would please the eyes and heart of a maiden whose love\r\nwas waiting the call it would so gladly obey; and though a heightened\r\ncolor was hidden by the quickly captured veil, a pleased smile made\r\nanswer to Irar's look of respectful admiration.\r\n\r\nTo his salutation, a voice sweet as the nightingale's responded, and\r\nthen the little form went tripping on, and disappeared through a\r\ngateway a short distance from where he stood.\r\n\r\nThe sunshine of his garden, the conquering of mighty cliffs, ceased to\r\nhave an attraction for Irar, and his feet seemed drawn to the secluded\r\nlane in which this vision had come to him. It was strange how many\r\nerrands there were calling the little maid along that shaded way; and\r\nthe wind was ever at hand to give one or more glimpses of the face\r\nthat was growing sweeter and brighter every day. But while joy was\r\nalways a portion of these meetings, now and then a dark thought would\r\ngive its stab; for was he not a slave? And how could he dare to look\r\nforward to a time when one so beautiful should be his own?--aye, all\r\nand all his own?\r\n\r\nHe had discovered that were he free he could claim this jewel, for she\r\nwas a peasant's daughter: and yet how far above him, for she was\r\nfree.\r\n\r\nHe had but just left her, having felt the warmth of her breath so near\r\nhis cheek that it thrilled him like wine, and the clinging clasp of\r\nher hand was still tingling in his blood.\r\n\r\n\"Oh that I could own this pearl!\" he cried: and then he shouted aloud\r\nin great joyfulness, for the sultan's proclamation flashed up in his\r\nmind, recalled by the word he had used.\r\n\r\nHe would find the sultan a pearl; he would be free--yes, and rich. But\r\nhis northern blood was cool, and he made sure that his dear one should\r\nnot suffer should he not succeed at first.\r\n\r\nWhen he met her the next day he said:\r\n\r\n\"I have come to bid you good-bye for a time.\"\r\n\r\nHer little hand trembled, and her bosom heaved as though a sob were\r\nwelling up for utterance.\r\n\r\n\"Only for a time, remember,\" he went on. \"And when I come again it\r\nwill be to claim a bride.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a supreme confidence in his tone, a foreshadowed success\r\nthat inspired even himself, as he asked:\r\n\r\n\"Will she be ready for me?\"\r\n\r\nFor answer she nestled in his arms, and no wind was needed to tear the\r\nveil aside that his lips might claim love's pledge from hers.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I have to wait long?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"No, perhaps a month; but I hope it will be less even than that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh that Allah would make it less!\" she answered.\r\n\r\nA long time they lingered in the rose-scented shadows, and then Irar,\r\nwith her kiss of hope and prayer warm on his lips, strode rapidly back\r\nto his home.\r\n\r\nArrived there, he rubbed his body thoroughly with oil to make it\r\nmobile and supple, and then sought the slumber that would give him\r\nstrength for his search.\r\n\r\nWith the first glinting of dawn he arose, and having partaken of a\r\nplain repast, sat down to consider how he should act did he find the\r\npearl.\r\n\r\nShould he give the gem to the inspector of the fisheries?\r\n\r\nNo, for the man was not friendly to him, and might prove false.\r\n\r\nThe better way would be for himself to carry it to the sultan, and as\r\nhe laid it at the feet of his royal master, claim the reward that had\r\nbeen offered.\r\n\r\nThis plan satisfied him, and then another thought arose: How should he\r\nhide it from the keen eyes of the watchful guards, whose duty it was\r\nto see that no gem was carried away, and who stood ready to search\r\neach diver as he appeared above the water?\r\n\r\nThis was a more difficult problem to settle than was that concerning\r\nthe way in which the gem should be conveyed to the sultan; and the sun\r\nhad risen far above the mountains lying eastward from the city before\r\nhe could devise a plan that seemed to meet his needs.\r\n\r\nAt last a smile of satisfaction took the place of the perplexed look\r\nthat had pervaded his face, and rising, he hastened to the bay.\r\n\r\nThe divers were already at work, and one or two had finished their\r\nlabor and were going away, when Irar sprang into his skiff and was\r\nrowed out to the deeper water, where the pearls lay hidden. He was not\r\nso easy to please as he had previously been, but scanned the water\r\ncuriously, directing the boatmen to pull in many different directions,\r\nwhile he stood in the bow, watching.\r\n\r\nSuddenly some mysterious prompting whispered, \"Now!\"--and without a\r\nmoment's hesitation he sprang from the skiff and sank swiftly down to\r\nthe indistinct depths below.\r\n\r\nMerciful Allah--did he see aright?\r\n\r\nYes, there lay the pearl he sought, perfect, brilliant, a gem that\r\nroyalty itself could not outshine.\r\n\r\nTo grasp it and thrust it into his mouth, yes, and to swallow it, was\r\nbut an instant's work; and then he quickly found another gem, and with\r\nit sped upward to the surface.\r\n\r\nA half-hour had not passed, and now he was hastening back to the city,\r\nbuoyant, elate, his heart beating with swift throbs of joy.\r\n\r\nHe did not seek his home, but turning down a narrow and unfrequented\r\nstreet sought a dark, closely-curtained house, and knocking, was\r\nsilently admitted by a sallow-hued man, whose broad brow and gleaming\r\neyes, set deep under shaggy brows, told of a strange and subtle power\r\nthat only he could wield.\r\n\r\n\"Well, friend Irar,\" he said, when he had led the young man to a dim\r\nroom at the back of the house, \"can I do aught for you to-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"You can. Listen.\" And Irar told, as briefly as he could, of his love,\r\nthe sultan's promise, and his success.\r\n\r\nThis done, he went on.\r\n\r\n\"That you are skilled in the arts of surgery is well known. If the\r\npearl stays in my stomach it will be ruined. For an act that saved\r\nyour life, which I was glad to do, help me now.\"\r\n\r\nThe man thought for a moment, and then said:\r\n\r\n\"I will, but you will be sick for a week, and perhaps for a longer\r\ntime. What must be done in this case?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your word will be enough to excuse me from work. Will you not go to\r\nthe vizier and make the excuse I need?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; and now, was the gem hard to swallow?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sit quiet here, I shall soon be ready.\"\r\n\r\nSwiftly the man prepared two mixtures and brought out some thin knives\r\nand other curious instruments. These and some bandages he placed on a\r\nsmall table that he drew near to a slab standing in the middle of the\r\napartment.\r\n\r\n\"Lie down here,\" he said, and Irar obeyed.\r\n\r\n\"If you feel the pearl forced up into your throat, do not struggle,\r\nbut grasp the sides of the slab, and keep as quiet as you can: I will\r\nsee that no harm comes to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do as you say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now drink this;\" and he handed Irar one of the potions he had\r\nprepared.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had Irar swallowed this than he grew faint and chill; and\r\nthen a horrible sickness filled him, and with violent retchings he\r\nsought to relieve the oppression in his stomach. The man stood by, a\r\nknife in his grasp, and just as Irar felt a lump stick in his throat a\r\nhand was clasped tightly below it, and it was forced upward. Then a\r\nswift movement of gleaming steel followed; and just as the pressure on\r\nhis lungs grew to a suffocating intensity, the lump causing this was\r\nejected from his throat, and stinging pain told of rapid punctures,\r\nthrough which a thread was quickly drawn.\r\n\r\nThen a burning liquid was applied to his throat, and a bandage wound\r\nabout it, after which he was carried to a couch and told to remain\r\nquiet.\r\n\r\nThen the man picked up the pearl and, washing it, held it up to the\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n\"A right royal gem,\" he cried, his eyes gleaming. \"Here, take it, or I\r\nshall begin to envy you your prize;\" and he thrust the pearl fiercely\r\ninto Irar's hand, going immediately from the apartment.\r\n\r\nIn an hour he returned, holding a paper that bore the seal of the\r\nvizier.\r\n\r\n\"You are excused for a month,\" he said, \"and before that time you will\r\nbe well: in fact, you will be able to move to your own house in two\r\nweeks. The one thing needful is that you keep your neck quiet.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not hard for Irar to do this, for did he not know that love and\r\nfreedom were both waiting for him? The days passed swiftly, for dreams\r\nof a happy future filled both waking and sleeping hours, and the\r\ncontentment that pervaded his existence made his recovery rapid.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a week the bandages were removed, and the surgeon looked\r\nin surprise at the nearly healed cut.\r\n\r\n\"This is better--much better than I hoped for,\" he said. \"A week more\r\nof quiet, and you will be all right.\"\r\n\r\nHe bathed the wound with a lotion, replaced the bandages, and then\r\nwandered restlessly about the room. This was but a repetition of his\r\ncourse ever since Irar had come to him, and caused his guest no\r\nuneasiness.\r\n\r\nAfter a time he grew quiet, and going to the window, seemed to be\r\npondering some plan. Then his face lightened, and coming back to\r\nIrar's couch he said:\r\n\r\n\"I will make a cooling drink for you, and then go out.\" And he left\r\nthe room, soon returning with the draught, which he held out to his\r\npatient, who took it and drained the liquor to the dregs.\r\n\r\nAgain the surgeon wandered about the room in a restless way, furtively\r\nwatching Irar, who soon felt a delicious languor stealing over his\r\nsenses.\r\n\r\n\"Let me see your pearl once more,\" said the surgeon, and Irar\r\nlanguidly handed it to him.\r\n\r\nDid he dream it?--or did he see the surgeon clutch it fiercely, then\r\nthrust it hurriedly into his mouth and with a gleam of savage triumph\r\nhastily swallow it?\r\n\r\nThere was no certainty of this when he awoke, but a strange sensation\r\nof indistinctness in his mind, which gradually cleared as his eyes\r\ngrew accustomed to the light. But he could not rid himself of the\r\nthought, and he thrust his hand under the covering of the couch where\r\nhe had kept the pearl, and started up with a cry of horror.\r\n\r\nThe pearl was gone!\r\n\r\nA man came running in, alarmed by his cry; and of him Irar demanded,\r\nin a voice choked and hoarse with emotion:\r\n\r\n\"Your master, quick!--where is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not seen him for a week.\"\r\n\r\n\"A week? And I?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have been asleep. My master said you would not wake before a week\r\nhad passed, and that he would return ere your slumber was broken.\"\r\n\r\nIt was true, then, this horror that he had thought a dream; and he\r\nburied his face in his hands that the servant might not see his\r\nemotion. In a little time he grew calm, and raising his head, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Has your master returned?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\nHe put up his hand, and felt his throat--the bandage was gone. To his\r\nquestioning look, the man said:\r\n\r\n\"The master ordered it. It was taken off the third day after he went\r\naway, and you can eat if you desire to.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will. Bring me a light repast.\"\r\n\r\nIn a little time he was eating the food brought, and calling for his\r\nclothes he put them on and tried to walk. At first his steps were\r\nunsteady, but they quickly grew firm. Finding that the pouch\r\ncontaining his knife and purse was in its place, he went forth. But\r\ninstead of seeking his own home, or the lane that had so often been\r\nthe goal of his wanderings, he turned southward, and leaving the city\r\nwas soon pacing the sands leading towards the rocks that he had so\r\nfrequently explored.\r\n\r\nSoon he reached them, and began his usual clambering among them, going\r\non and on, but keeping near the sea. At times his hand would explore\r\nthe pouch where his knife was, and once he drew it forth, and his eyes\r\ngleamed with satisfaction as his finger tested the keenness of its\r\nblade.\r\n\r\nHis glance sought every shadowy hollow, and twice he turned into\r\nfissures that seemed to lead to a deeper gloom. But he returned and\r\nkept on, reaching at last a bold crag, beneath which a gully of the\r\nsea ran in--so narrow that he could almost step across it.\r\n\r\nThe garrulous call of a gull drew his attention to a dark object that\r\nrose and fell with the swelling and sinking of the tide, close to a\r\nlittle square of sand at the head of this opening. It had a strangely\r\nhuman look, and he made his way down to it. Taking off his sandals, he\r\ngathered his garments up above the wash of the waves, and soon had\r\ngrasped the floating clothes that streamed out from the central mass.\r\n\r\nThe strain caused this to turn over, and showed him the white and\r\nlivid face of the very man who had played him false.\r\n\r\nFor a moment a savage joy filled his soul, and then his manhood\r\nexerted its sway, and pity came; and as the softer feeling caused a\r\nmist to gather in his eyes, he noticed that there was a large,\r\nunnatural lump protruding from the dead man's throat.\r\n\r\nHastily drawing the body on the sands, he drew forth his knife, and\r\ncarefully cut the flesh about this.\r\n\r\nA cry of joy came, as his pearl dropped from the slit and lay, clear\r\nand shining, on the sand.\r\n\r\nHastily secreting it, his better thought prompted him to bury the man\r\nwhose avarice had come so near wrecking his life, and finding an oar\r\nblade on the sand, he dug a grave close to the rock, and dragged the\r\nbody to this.\r\n\r\nA small tablet fell from the clothing as he was doing this, and he\r\npicked it up and put it in his pouch. Then he covered the body, and\r\nheaped the sand high above it.\r\n\r\nResting for a little time, he clambered back to the top of the cliff\r\nand quickly returned to the city, hastening to the vizier's palace.\r\n\r\nHis request to have audience with the sultan was immediately granted,\r\nand the vizier being about to report to his royal master, Irar was\r\ntold to accompany him.\r\n\r\nArrived at the palace, the vizier quickly made Irar's wish known.\r\n\r\n\"The slave I gave your highness for a pearl-fisher desires to speak\r\nwith you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let him speak, for he has ever done his work well,\" said the sultan.\r\n\r\nBowing his head low, Irar held out his hand, closed over the pearl.\r\n\r\n\"Your highness promised freedom and gold to the slave who should bring\r\nyou the finest pearl on earth; will this one win the gift?\" And he\r\nunclasped his hand and showed the peerless gem it had hidden.\r\n\r\nWith a cry of delight, the sultan said:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you are free, and the golden pieces shall be paid you when you\r\nwish them--now, if it is your choice. More, I appoint you the\r\ninspector of my pearl fisheries. Hand me the gem, and do you see our\r\nwishes fulfilled.\"\r\n\r\nThe last commands were addressed to the vizier, who took the pearl and\r\nlaid it in the sultan's hand. Irar bowed low, and withdrew to the\r\nouter court by the palace gate. Here he was soon joined by the vizier,\r\nwho gave him the certificate of his freedom, and the royal decree\r\nannouncing his appointment to the inspectorship.\r\n\r\nHe also gave Irar some costly jewels, saying:\r\n\r\n\"You have done well. The sultan is overjoyed at this rare good\r\nfortune, for the pearl is much larger than that of the Sultan of\r\nCoromandel. He has remembered that I gave you to him, and so I share\r\nmy gain with you.\"\r\n\r\nIrar thanked him, and taking the papers, asked permission to be absent\r\nfrom duty for a time.\r\n\r\n\"You are free, and can do what you please, and you need not assume\r\nyour new duties for a week.\"\r\n\r\nThanking him, Irar hastened away. It was growing late, but the sun\r\nstill shone in the lane when he turned down its shadowy way. The gate\r\nwas quickly reached; but before he came to it, it was flung open, and\r\nthe light and gladness of his life shone on him.\r\n\r\nAs he clasped her in his arms, she murmured:\r\n\r\n\"I have watched for you every day; but now I shall have no more\r\nwatching or waiting.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, my darling, you will not. Lead me to your father: I would speak\r\nwith him.\"\r\n\r\nIt took but a short time for Irar to secure the consent that he\r\nsought. His royal appointment was a powerful factor in the argument,\r\nand he returned to his home a happy man.\r\n\r\nAs he was removing his garments before retiring, the tablet that he\r\nhad found on the surgeon's body fell to the floor. Picking it up, he\r\nopened it, and saw some partly obliterated writing. Closely scanning\r\nthis, he read the following:\r\n\r\n\"I have the pearl: it is mine. But since I have swallowed it I have\r\nbecome possessed with the thought that there is another like it--yes,\r\nlarger and more brilliant--waiting my seeking; and to-night I shall go\r\nout to the fisheries and find it. I shall go alone, in a skiff that I\r\nhave hired; and to-morrow I shall have two pearls, like which the\r\nworld has no more.\"\r\n\r\n\"The fool!--he could not swim,\" said Irar, \"for I rescued him from the\r\nsea when he tried to. Well, he wrought his own punishment, and may\r\nAllah forgive him as I do.\" And he sought his couch.\r\n\r\nOne week after this occurred Irar carried to the larger home that was\r\nallowed him as inspector of the pearl fisheries the sweetest and\r\nfairest bride in all the wide Persian realms, a bride more pure and\r\nlovely than the pearl that had given him his freedom and crowned his\r\nlove with triumph.\r\n\r\n                                           THOS. S. COLLIER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE FIRST REGIMENTS OF U. S. COLORED TROOPS_\r\n\r\nAND HOW THEY WERE RAISED.\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 22, 1863, a general order, No. 143, establishing a bureau \"for the\r\norganization of colored troops,\" and providing for the detail of three\r\nfield officers as Inspectors of these troops and for the creation of a\r\nboard to examine applicants was issued from the War Department.\r\n\r\nAlthough some colored men had been enlisted in Louisville and, under\r\nthe authority of General Hunter, in South Carolina, the above order\r\nwas the first formal recognition of this class of troops by the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe Inspectors were to supervise at such points as might be indicated\r\nby the War Department \"in the Northern and Western States,\" but\r\nrecruiting stations and depots were to be established by the\r\nAdjutant-general as circumstances should require: the first clause\r\nexpressing the conservatism of President Lincoln, and the second\r\naffording a wider range for the energies of Secretary Stanton.\r\n\r\nThe first Inspector detailed was Colonel William Birney, of the 4th\r\nNew Jersey Volunteers. He was an Alabamian by birth, the son of James\r\nG. Birney, who had been the Presidential candidate of the Liberty\r\nparty in 1840 and 1844. He had enlisted as a private and been elected\r\nCaptain in the 1st New Jersey, had served through the different\r\nregimental grades, and had just been nominated to the Senate as\r\nBrigadier-general. At the beginning of the war he predicted to his\r\nfriends, Secretary Chase and Henry Wilson (chairman of the Senate\r\nCommittee on military affairs), the exigency for calling colored\r\ntroops into the service, and had offered, in that event, to aid in\r\norganizing them without regard to his grade in the white troops. Hence\r\nhis detail after more than two years' waiting.\r\n\r\nReporting at Washington in the first days of June for his new duty,\r\nColonel Birney was kindly received by the Secretary of War, but found\r\nthat neither he nor Mr. Lincoln had marked out any definite line of\r\naction or had any orders ready to give him. Day after day his anxious\r\ninquiries were met by the same answer:\r\n\r\n\"Wait a little longer; we are not ready yet.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, about the 10th of June, weary with oscillating between the\r\nEbbitt House and the War Department, the Colonel asked leave of Mr.\r\nStanton to organize a colored regiment at Washington. Written orders\r\nwere refused, but oral permission to do what he could was granted him.\r\nHe went to work at once, and before the 18th of June he had enlisted,\r\nuniformed, armed, and equipped four hundred men, gathered from\r\nWashington, Georgetown, Alexandria, and the country beyond. They were\r\nof course very raw material, but their habits of obedience and\r\ntemperance were equivalent to the usual quickness and independence of\r\nthe white troops. They were proud of their new position and\r\nenthusiastic in learning the manual of arms, even rising at four\r\no'clock in the morning to begin their drill, which they practised\r\nincessantly through the day. The brightest among them were made\r\nsergeants and corporals, while young officers from the white regiments\r\naround Washington were detailed to serve as captains and lieutenants.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the month the 1st U. S. Colored Regiment was full, and\r\nColonel Birney marched it down the avenue, past the White House to the\r\nCapitol, and back; affording a rare spectacle to the crowds that\r\nfollowed it, and one which the old inhabitants of the city certainly\r\nhad never expected to see. But there they were, ten companies of\r\nblack, brown, and yellow men, ex-slaves, dressed in the uniform of the\r\nUnited States, armed and equipped like white soldiers, and pledged to\r\nstand by the Government in its struggle with their former masters.\r\nThey made a fine appearance, marching quite as well as white soldiers,\r\nand calling forth many compliments for themselves and their officers.\r\n\r\nStill no orders came from the War Department, and it was some time\r\nbefore Colonel Birney understood the cause of the delay. Recruiting\r\nfor colored troops had been begun in Philadelphia and Boston, but\r\nprogressed slowly; and at Washington men were not obtained in any\r\ngreat numbers from the resident free people of color, but were mostly\r\nfugitive slaves from Maryland and Virginia. Colonel Birney represented\r\nto Mr. Stanton the advantages of recruiting, in the States named, and\r\nthe superiority as soldiers of the men raised on farms to those\r\ngathered in the alleys and slums of northern cities.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary listened attentively, and after reflecting a few\r\nmoments, said:\r\n\r\n\"Go over to the White House and have a talk with the President. Don't\r\nsay that I sent you. We will talk the matter over afterwards.\"\r\n\r\nThe Colonel was promptly admitted to Mr. Lincoln's presence, and a\r\ncomplimentary remark of the President on the excellent appearance made\r\nby the colored regiment opened the way for his visitor to give his\r\nviews about recruiting from the Maryland farms.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed Mr. Lincoln; \"you surely do not mean that we should\r\ntake the slaves?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President,\" replied the Colonel, \"a man's allegiance to his\r\nGovernment is not subordinate to claims of private parties upon him.\r\nIf he is willing to fight for his country he should be allowed to do\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"But my pledge!\" said Mr. Lincoln. \"You forget my pledge to the loyal\r\nslave States, in my proclamation of emancipation.\"\r\n\r\nHere, then, was the point of difference between Mr. Stanton and the\r\nPresident. The former was willing to recruit colored troops in the\r\nloyal slave States, and the latter was opposed to it.\r\n\r\nOf course the subject was dropped.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of June Col. Birney was ordered to Norfolk to recruit\r\nslaves of rebels, but he had scarcely begun when another order brought\r\nhim back to Washington.\r\n\r\nArriving about the 4th of July, Mr. Stanton showed him a letter from\r\nGeneral Schenck, commanding the district of Maryland, stating that\r\nlarge numbers of free men of color had been gathered at Baltimore to\r\nwork on the fortifications, and that a competent officer, if sent at\r\nonce, might get a great many recruits among them. In answer to the\r\nSecretary's question of what he thought of this, Colonel Birney\r\nanswered:\r\n\r\n\"I can organize several regiments in Baltimore, but probably not from\r\nthe class mentioned by General Schenck. Free colored men will not\r\nfight to help the Government maintain slavery in Maryland; and that is\r\nthe President's pledge. But the slaves will enlist, for they will get\r\ntheir freedom by it. If you send me to Maryland it must be with the\r\nknowledge that I will never recognize one man's right of property in\r\nanother. I believe, with the Vermont justice, that the only proof of\r\nsuch a right is a deed signed and sealed by the Creator.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Stanton laughed. \"Well,\" he said, \"whatever you do, remember you\r\ndo it on your own responsibility.\" This was repeated and emphasized.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel accepted the terms, asking the favor, however, that Mr.\r\nStanton would do what he could for him in the event of the President's\r\ndispleasure. This was cheerfully promised, and the necessary orders\r\nwere then made out. A letter also was written to General Schenck\r\ndirecting him to recognize Colonel Birney as in charge of the\r\nrecruiting of colored troops in Maryland, and to have his requisitions\r\nhonored by the ordinance, commissary, and quartermaster officers.\r\nThat is, the Colonel was to have _carte blanche_ for his special\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nThe large barracks near Druid Hill Park having been assigned for his\r\nuse by General Schenck, who named them \"Birney Barracks,\" the Colonel\r\ntelegraphed for the 1st Regiment. As the \"Plug Uglies\" before the war,\r\nand the attacks made on the first northern volunteers by the Baltimore\r\npopulace, had given that city the reputation of being peopled chiefly\r\nby roughs and rebels, it was thought best to have a sufficient force\r\nthere to overawe the violent.\r\n\r\nThe regiment, under command of Colonel Holman, arrived at night\r\nwithout accident. It was put into good condition, and a few days\r\nlater, with Colonel Birney riding at its head, was marched, with\r\nmusic, flying colors, and fixed bayonets, through the principal\r\nstreets of the city, causing immense excitement and some apprehension\r\namong all classes. Doors and blinds were hastily closed, and the\r\npolice gathered in force to be ready to repress disorders. But none\r\noccurred. One man was arrested for hurrahing for Jeff Davis; but this,\r\nscarcely worth noticing, was the only incident that indicated rebel\r\nsentiment.\r\n\r\nFrom that date the populace accepted the situation, and it was quite\r\nsafe for recruiting squads of colored soldiers to march through every\r\nquarter of the city.\r\n\r\nIt was worth going some distance to see the sergeant selected to\r\ncommand these squads march his men out. Black as a coal, his grand,\r\nmartial air and proud assumption of authority were most impressive,\r\nwhile his stern, ringing voice made itself heard all over the drill\r\nground. No doubt his pompous manner, aided by his uniform, had much to\r\ndo in bringing in recruits.\r\n\r\nThe business of recruiting was, however, one of peculiar danger in\r\nother places. About this time a Lieutenant who had been left at\r\nNorfolk by Colonel Birney was foully murdered. A little later another\r\nwas shot down near Benedict, and a recruiting agent was mobbed and\r\nkilled in Frederick County. On two occasions armed men lay in ambush\r\nfor the purpose of shooting Colonel Birney, but he was forewarned.\r\n\r\nIt very soon became evident that more energetic means must be adopted\r\nfor filling up regiments. Accordingly, a requisition was made for a\r\nsmall steamboat for the purpose of recruiting along the eastern shore\r\nof Maryland. Before, however, completing his arrangements to do this,\r\nColonel Birney's attention was called to another matter, the result\r\nof which did not tend to make him more popular with Maryland\r\nslave-owners.\r\n\r\nCalling at General Schenck's office, one morning, a letter was handed\r\nhim to read by Adjutant-general Piatt, which I here copy _verbatim et\r\nliteratim_. It was addressed to President Lincoln and dated:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"BALTIMORE, June 15, 1863.\r\n\r\n    \"HON. PRESIDENT ABRAHAM LICCLN. _Sir_: i would like to inquire\r\n    from you sir that we slaves are entitle to Be confine In\r\n    prison By our masters or not sir. We have bin In Prison for\r\n    two years and a half and some are Bin in here for seventeen\r\n    months and so our masters are Rible General A. B. Steward and\r\n    are now in the Rible Army sir and put us slaves here Before He\r\n    went into the Rible Army and we are Bin here Ever sence and we\r\n    are waitin to Be inlisted in the army or navy sir to fite for\r\n    the stars and stripes there is about 20 of slaves in the Balto\r\n    city jail our masters says that they are going to keep we\r\n    slaves in Prison untill the war is over or soon as he can get\r\n    a chance to send us slaves Down South to the Rebilious and we\r\n    all would like to have our Liberty sir and i sir i wish you\r\n    would do something For we Poor Slaves we have no shoes or\r\n    clothing to put Put on only what we Beg from the soldiers and\r\n    citizens that comes to the Prison i would like to have my\r\n    liberty. Direct your letter to Captain James warden in the\r\n    city jail then he will give the Slaves their Libberty from\r\n    your humble Servant.\"\r\n\r\nNo name was signed to this document, probably from prudential reasons.\r\nThe name of the warden was, however, repeated, as though to emphasize\r\nthe address.\r\n\r\nSuch an appeal could not but make a profound impression on Colonel\r\nBirney. He caused some inquiries to be made among the colored people,\r\nand learned that there were in the city at least three slave-pens in\r\nwhich men, women, and children had been confined for safekeeping since\r\nthe beginning of the war. Thirty cents a head per day was the charge\r\nfor keeping them, and they were to remain in confinement until the\r\nclose of hostilities.\r\n\r\nCol. Birney decided that no time should be lost in attending to this\r\nbusiness. He called to see General Schenck about it, but the General\r\nhad gone to Washington. Colonel Piatt was in the office, however, and\r\nunhesitatingly gave the required permit to open the jails.\r\n\r\nTaking with him a few soldiers, Colonel Birney visited, one after the\r\nother, the dreadful pens where nearly one hundred human beings were\r\nfound in a condition of misery almost incredible to the present\r\ngeneration. Nearly all the men and many of the women were chained in\r\nsome manner or other. One aged man wore an iron collar to which a\r\nchain was fastened attached to an iron band around one ankle, and so\r\nshort that it was with difficulty a step could be taken. Another,\r\nalmost as old, was chained in a similar way from an iron belt to both\r\nankles. Some were handcuffed and some had only their ankles chained\r\ntogether. The only place for fresh air or exercise was a small\r\ncourt-yard inclosed by high brick walls which, being whitewashed, had\r\nseriously affected the eyes of all the prisoners. Only a few of them\r\ncould see well at night, and some were almost totally blind. A few\r\nafterwards recovered, but several lost their sight completely. In this\r\ncondition they had been kept for two years or more.\r\n\r\nA blacksmith was sent for, and in a few minutes every chain was broken\r\nand the captives were told that they were free. The younger ones\r\nreceived the announcement with shouts and laughter, and ran eagerly to\r\ngather up all their little belongings and make themselves as tidy as\r\npossible before leaving the prisons. Others were incredulous and timid\r\nabout accepting the boon offered to them, while the older ones, more\r\ndeeply imbued with the religious spirit, raised streaming eyes to\r\nheaven and thanked the Lord that their deliverance had come at last.\r\n\r\nThey were all marched to the barracks and examined by the surgeons. A\r\nfew only were found available as soldiers. The others were sent to the\r\nQuartermaster's Department in Washington and disposed of there. The\r\nexpressions of gratitude from those who remained with us were most\r\nfervent, but often a little amusing. Colonel Birney was spoken of\r\namong them as a man sent by the Lord, a second Moses come to deliver\r\nand lead His oppressed people. He was prayed for in their evening\r\nprayer-meetings, and the Lord implored to be with him and \"purtect him\r\nalways, on de right hand and on de left, in de front and in de rar;\"\r\nand one earnest old man was heard to pray: \"Eben as he hab done it\r\nunto de least ob dese, my chillun, say de Lord, he hab done it unto\r\nme, and we prays dat de Lord will recognize dat fact and bless him\r\naccordin'.\"\r\n\r\nThe opening of the slave pens, and the revelations concerning the\r\ntreatment of the prisoners confined there, caused, as may well be\r\nsupposed, a great sensation. Owners of slaves began to discuss\r\nmeasures to protect themselves from Colonel Birney's operations.\r\nReverdy Johnson was appealed to and secured as their representative,\r\nand complaints were forwarded to Washington. That these were not\r\nnoticed at that time was due, in a great measure, to the influence of\r\nthe Hon. Winter Davis, then member of Congress, and of Judge Hugh L.\r\nBond, between whom and Colonel Birney a warm friendship existed as\r\nwell as entire unanimity of opinion on the colored soldier question.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel now felt free to carry out the plans he had matured, of\r\nthe success of which he had not the slightest doubt. Taking with him a\r\nfew of his most reliable officers, he embarked on the steamer that had\r\nbeen furnished him and started on his first voyage of discovery. He\r\nwas absent a little over a week, and was so much encouraged by what he\r\nheard and saw that no delay was made in despatching the boat again,\r\nthis time in command of one of the lieutenant-colonels.\r\n\r\nAnd now all along the eastern and western shores the news flew that\r\nable-bodied men would be received as soldiers, transported to a place\r\nof safety, and no questions asked. On it went like the unseen blaze\r\nbeneath the pine brush, darting out now here, now there, still\r\ntravelling swiftly and silently until it reached the remotest\r\ndistricts of the State, and the black population knew that its\r\nemancipation was in its own hands. Soon one boat was not enough to\r\nbring away all who were willing to serve in the Union army. A second\r\nboat and then a third were added to the service, and recruiting\r\nstations were opened in various parts of the State. To these flocked\r\nthe slaves, fugitives from both rebel and loyal masters, many of them\r\nat the risk of their lives bringing their families with them, walking\r\noften forty and fifty miles to reach the station. Here they were\r\nprotected until the boats came along which carried them to Baltimore.\r\nA crowd always gathered to see them land, and followed as--often two\r\nand three hundred together--they were marched in double file through\r\nthe streets to the barracks.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly a grotesque but pathetic spectacle, that of these\r\npeople just escaped from bondage, all ragged, many of them with scarce\r\ntatters enough for decency, barefooted and bareheaded, or with\r\nhandkerchiefs around their heads, dirty and forlorn, each one carrying\r\na little bundle containing his entire earthly possessions.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon their arrival at the barracks the men were examined,\r\nthe able-bodied ones enlisted, the rest otherwise disposed of.\r\n\r\nBefore the 1st of August the 2d and 4th regiments were complete, the\r\n7th and 8th more than half full, and the 9th was begun.[1]\r\n\r\nIt was surprising how many men had to be rejected. Sometimes out of\r\na hundred recruits fifty would be found physically unfit for service.\r\nBut those accepted were, as a rule, fine, hearty fellows.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary process to becoming a soldier was not always relished.\r\nThe carbolic soap bath in the river, with the after clipping and\r\nshaving and shampooing, being in many cases a first experience, was\r\nnot submitted to in every instance without grumbling. A few even\r\nrebelled, positively refusing to go into the water. A facetious\r\nsergeant, detailed to supervise the scrubbing, originated an argument\r\nwhich proved most effective.\r\n\r\n\"Look at you now,\" he was heard to say, \"you ignorant nigger! You\r\ndon't know nothin'. Don't you see your ole close a burnin' up on de\r\nsho', and don't you know when you gits inter dat ribber and scrubs wid\r\nde guvment soap you washes all de slavery out ob you? Go 'long wid\r\nyou!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the subject, aided by a touch of the sergeant's foot, would make\r\nno further resistance.\r\n\r\nBut when, the bath and barbering over, comfortable under-clothing was\r\ngiven them and they were then arrayed in bright new uniforms and a\r\nglittering musket was put into their hands, surely Solomon in all his\r\nglory never experienced the glow of satisfaction that warmed the\r\nhearts of these ex-slaves as they viewed each other, and each man knew\r\nthat he looked just like his fellows. For the first time in their\r\nlives they were men, not \"boys,\"--not chattels to be disposed of at\r\nthe will of a master, but owning themselves, treated with respect, and\r\nconsidered worthy to take part with white men in defending the Union.\r\nIn many of them the almost immediate change in look and bearing from\r\ncringing humility or unmeaning levity to earnest willingness and\r\nself-confidence was strikingly apparent; in others the change came\r\ngradually, as though time were needed to make them realize the\r\nrevolution that had taken place. But it was surprising how quickly the\r\nvast majority learned well what was required of them, and how few\r\nrascals there were. Intemperance and profanity were exceedingly rare\r\namong them, and the guard-house opened its doors to a much less number\r\nthan was usual in white regiments.\r\n\r\nOf course there was general dissatisfaction among the abandoned\r\nmasters and mistresses, many of whom were left without a single\r\nfield-hand or house-servant. Scarcely a day passed without bringing\r\none or two of these owners or their agents to inquire for some Sam or\r\nTom or Dick. They were always invited up to headquarters to present\r\ntheir claims, and the records were examined for their satisfaction.\r\nIf the names of their slaves were among the enlisted men, the\r\nex-owners were required to produce a certificate of loyalty from the\r\nprovost marshal of their district; and, if this was satisfactory, they\r\nwere referred to the Board of Claims, to be organized in Baltimore for\r\nthe purpose of deciding upon such cases. If they could show no proper\r\ncertificate, they were summarily dismissed. Very often a man would\r\nchange his name when he enlisted, thus making it very difficult for\r\nhis master to trace him, besides causing confusion and a good deal of\r\nmerriment among the young officers, as those who took new names\r\ninvariably forgot them.\r\n\r\n\"Andy Smith!\" the sergeant would cry at roll-call; but no Andy Smith\r\nwould answer until, the name having been repeated several times, some\r\ncomrade would nudge the fellow who had assumed it, saying:\r\n\r\n\"You is Andy Smith; don't you 'member you is?\"\r\n\r\nAnd then there would be a start and an exclamation of:\r\n\r\n\"So I is--I done forgot!\" followed by a loud \"Here!\"\r\n\r\nAmusing and sometimes pathetic scenes between masters and servants\r\nwere of frequent occurrence. It was surprising in how short a time a\r\npoor, crying, slovenly slave became a bright, neat, self-asserting\r\nman.\r\n\r\nOne morning a tall, ungainly fellow, who had tramped several days to\r\nget to us, was brought to headquarters. He looked as though he had\r\nbeen driven and hunted all his life; but he was strongly built, and\r\nhis ebony countenance, though showing a good deal of anxiety,\r\nexpressed fearlessness and resolution. The officer who accompanied him\r\nreported him sound in every way except that he stuttered badly. Before\r\nthe Colonel could speak to him, the fellow managed, with much\r\ndifficulty, to get out an earnest request that he should not be\r\n\"'jected.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you could not give the countersign if challenged,\" said the\r\ncolonel.\r\n\r\n\"Jes try me, please, mars Colonel,\" the poor man stuttered. He was\r\ntried with the regular drill orders, and the proof of the man's pluck\r\nwas that, though surrounded by a crowd that laughed at his ridiculous\r\nefforts, he made an heroic stagger at every order, and with a certain\r\nair of dignity that had its effect. At any rate, the Colonel, pleased\r\nwith his manly bearing, told him that if he would come up the next\r\nmorning and give those orders without stuttering he should be mustered\r\ninto the service. Whether what his comrades asserted, that he spent\r\nthe night practising in the grove back of the barracks, was true or\r\nnot, it is a fact that the next morning he appeared bright and cheery,\r\nand in a voice that resounded over the campus he repeated every order\r\npromptly and intelligibly. He was accepted and a few days afterwards\r\nput on guard at the foot of the hill. As he was quietly pacing up and\r\ndown his beat, a man rode up, sprang to the ground, and saying, \"Look\r\nafter my horse, fellow,\" started to walk up the hill. He failed to\r\nrecognize in the neat, fine-looking soldier whom he had addressed his\r\nrunaway slave. But the slave knew his late master, and with the sense\r\nof security inspired by his uniform and his loaded musket, he stepped\r\nforward. He could now say \"Halt!\" without stuttering, and he said it\r\nin a very decided tone. And then the master, looking sharply at him,\r\nexclaimed with an oath:\r\n\r\n\"Sam, you stuttering idiot! what are you doing here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Defendin' de country, mas--sa,\" Sam stuttered.\r\n\r\nHis master burst out laughing, and with another oath ordered Sam to\r\nstand aside and let him pass, as he had come to take his man back\r\nhome, and intended to do it. But Sam was not alarmed. He lowered his\r\nmusket significantly, and managed to say:\r\n\r\n\"I aint nobody's slave no more, massa. I'se under the orders of de\r\nUnited States Guvement, and dem orders is to let nobody parss here\r\nwhat can't gib de countersign. Ef you kin do dat, you kin parss: ef\r\nnot--not!\"\r\n\r\nThe master raved and stormed in vain. Sam stood firm, until the\r\nofficer of the day who, unobserved, had witnessed the scene from a\r\nclump of trees, thought best to interfere. He escorted the irate\r\nMarylander to the Colonel's office, but it is hardly necessary to say\r\nhe was obliged to return home alone, as he came.[2]\r\n\r\nA very similar incident occurred shortly afterwards, which I believe\r\nfound its way into the papers: but it will bear repetition.\r\n\r\nA new recruit, feeling to an exaggerated extent the dignity and the\r\nimportance with which his uniform invested him, and realizing also,\r\nperhaps, the solemn obligations of his oath, was approached while on\r\nguard by his former master, and, with the usual oaths, ordered to get\r\nout of the way. This the sentinel declined to do, and the master began\r\nto abuse him for \"a coward,\" \"a black scoundrel,\" \"a sneaking thief,\"\r\netc., etc., all of which the soldier bore unmoved. But when the white\r\nman, still more infuriated by this indifference, damned the Union\r\nArmy and even the uniform the black man wore, the latter became\r\nexcited, and facing his angry master, said, in a very forcible manner:\r\n\r\n\"Massa, you kin 'buse dis nigger as a nigger as much as you please:\r\ndat don't hurt nobody. But when you damn dese buttons, you damns de\r\ngoviment, sar, and dat am treason, and I'se pledged to stop it. Now\r\nscoot!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he charged on the astonished master, driving him down the slope\r\nand into the road, and kept his musket levelled at him until he saw\r\nhim get on a street-car and ride away.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, curiosity brought many people from the city every\r\nafternoon to see the troops drill, and before the end of the summer it\r\nbecame the fashionable thing for ladies and gentlemen driving out to\r\nstop below the hill on which the barracks stood and remain during the\r\nwhole parade. Many even descended from their carriages and came up the\r\nslope to get a better view. As to the colored population, the\r\nbarracks, and all that took place there, were full of interest for\r\nthem. It seemed as though each one felt that he or she gained\r\nsomething in importance by belonging to a class that was attracting so\r\nmuch attention. Those especially who had sons or brothers among the\r\ntroops rose at once in their own estimation and in their social scale.\r\nI could cite a number of amusing illustrations of this vainglorious\r\nsentiment, but one will suffice.\r\n\r\nThe respectable matron who did my washing came to me one morning to\r\nsay that she would be obliged to give up my patronage, as her son had\r\njust enlisted and she could not think of disgracing him by continuing\r\nher business. Remonstrance was in vain; she retired from the suds, and\r\nlived on her importance and, presumably, on her son's pay.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon in the early fall two ladies came to headquarters. They\r\nwere dressed in fashionable mourning, were gentle of speech and\r\nmanner, and evidently belonged to the best society. They stated that\r\nthey owned a large farm in Calvert County, had been visiting in\r\nPhiladelphia, and had just learned that two \"valuable boys\" belonging\r\nto them had run away and enlisted in Baltimore. The \"boys\" had been\r\nbrought up in the family, had always been kindly treated, were\r\nperfectly contented, and must have been worked upon in some subtle\r\nmanner to have been induced to leave. They felt sure that if they\r\ncould see them they could persuade them to return, as they could not\r\nbear the thought of the hardships the \"boys\" must undergo in army\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel looked over the roll and found the names of the \"boys,\"\r\nwho had enlisted two weeks before. He informed the ladies that, even\r\nif willing, these soldiers could not be remanded to slavery; but if\r\nthey would like to see them, he would send for them. The ladies\r\nrequested that this should be done, and an orderly was dispatched to\r\nbring the fugitives.\r\n\r\nFew worse specimens, as regarded raggedness and general evidences of\r\nhard usage, than these two men had come up from the western shore.\r\nWhen they now made their appearance in the office, tall, good-looking\r\nfellows, in their clean uniforms and new shoes, and their countenances\r\nbeaming with satisfaction, it was no wonder that their mistresses did\r\nnot at first recognize them, and were embarrassed in addressing them.\r\nA short conversation ensued, during which the men, though perfectly\r\nrespectful, let the ladies understand that they were neither ashamed\r\nnor sorry for having left the old home. As the visitors, evidently\r\nmuch chagrined, at last arose to go, one of them, extending her hand\r\nto the younger one, said:\r\n\r\n\"Well, John, good-bye; I am going home to-morrow. What shall I tell\r\nthe people for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Give 'em my love, marm,\" said John, \"an' tell em I's mighty glad I's\r\nhere, an' I wish dey was all here, too.\"\r\n\r\nThe other lady had taken out her pocket-book, and now said to the\r\nother:\r\n\r\n\"And you, Will, what shall I say for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell 'em all, marm,\" he earnestly replied, \"dat de Lord hab broke my\r\nyoke an' made me free. Tell em I'se happier dan I eber 'spected to be\r\nin dis world--an' I blesses 'em all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" she said coldly, and dropped something into his hand.\r\nBoth ladies bowed and departed.\r\n\r\nThe man Will stood looking reflectively at what his mistress had given\r\nhim. As the door closed on her, he turned to the Colonel and, showing\r\na silver quarter, said:\r\n\r\n\"I'se worked fur dat woman mor'n twenty years, an' dis is de fust bit\r\nob money she eber gib me!\"\r\n\r\nTowards the last of September Secretary Chase, being in Baltimore, was\r\ninvited by Judge Bond to drive out to the barracks and witness the\r\nparade of the colored troops. His appearance was a pleasant surprise\r\nto Colonel Birney, who, up to that time, had failed to elicit from him\r\nany expression of interest in his work; though, on account of old\r\nfriendship and political sympathies, the Secretary was the first\r\nperson from whom the Colonel had expected support. But Mr. Chase had\r\nnot as yet gone beyond the President in his views concerning the\r\nenlistment of slaves. He, however, expressed himself greatly pleased\r\nas well as surprised at the fine display the troops made, and the next\r\nweek he repeated his visit, accompanied by Secretary Stanton.\r\n\r\nAs it happened, one of the recruiting boats arrived that very day,\r\nbringing over two hundred of the usual miserable crowd. Instead of\r\nhaving the men among them inspected at once, the Colonel saved them\r\nfor his afternoon programme.\r\n\r\nThe expected visit of the distinguished men became known in the city,\r\nand long before the time for parade the road in front of the barracks\r\nwas blocked with open carriages filled with ladies and gentlemen. The\r\ntwo secretaries, in a landau, were so placed that they had an\r\nuninterrupted view of everything.\r\n\r\nThe bugle sounded and the different companies, with bayonets and every\r\naccoutrement glistening, marched in splendid order to their respective\r\npositions. As the last company wheeled into line, and while the\r\nspectators were enthusiastically expressing their admiration of its\r\nsoldierly bearing, the raw recruits who had arrived in the morning\r\nfiled up and, each one grasping his little bundle, were placed in line\r\nwith the others. Their tattered garments, shoeless feet, and\r\ndisreputable appearance generally, afforded a striking and painful\r\ncontrast to their uniformed brethren. The suggestiveness of the\r\nspectacle could not but strike every beholder. Mr. Chase declared it\r\nwas the most impressive sight he had ever witnessed. Mr. Stanton\r\nwarmly congratulated Colonel Birney, and expressed his satisfaction\r\nand his thanks that so much had been accomplished without embarrassing\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe vigor with which recruiting had been pushed had taken the Maryland\r\nslave-holders by surprise. For some weeks they made no appeal to the\r\ngovernment. Then, recovering their self-possession, they set to work\r\nto procure a revocation of Colonel Birney's authority.\r\n\r\nTheir first applications were made singly or by delegations to General\r\nSchenck or, in his absence, to his Adjutant-general, Donn Piatt, both\r\nof whom had steadily and cordially given their official aid and\r\nsupport to Colonel Birney's operations, though, from the nature of his\r\norders, he was not subject to their command. The General, with quiet\r\ndignity, referred the envoys to Secretary Stanton, but held out no\r\nhope of change; but the adjutant gave them deep offence by his sturdy\r\npatriotism, expressed with the wit and humor for which he has always\r\nbeen celebrated.\r\n\r\nSecretary Stanton was deaf to remonstrances. But it was not long\r\nbefore Reverdy Johnson and Governor Swann discovered that the\r\nPresident was not aware of the enlistment of slaves. Petitions,\r\nletters of complaint, and charges against Colonel Birney were now\r\npoured in on Mr. Lincoln. Finally, Reverdy Johnson and the Governor,\r\nat the head of a Maryland delegation of slave-holders, called on him\r\nand presented the grievance with all the eloquence they could command.\r\n\r\nThe President was much disturbed, and supposing General Schenck to be\r\nthe responsible party, wrote to him intimating a purpose to disavow\r\nhis acts. Thereupon the General went to Washington and, explaining his\r\nposition in the matter, protested against censure or disavowal, and\r\ntendered his resignation as commandant in Maryland if such a step\r\nagainst him was intended. Mr. Lincoln listened patiently. Then, after\r\na short pause, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Schenck, do you know what a _galled prairie_ is?\"\r\n\r\nThe general knew every kind of prairie except that.\r\n\r\n\"The galled prairie,\" resumed Mr. Lincoln, \"lies on the slope back\r\nfrom the narrow river bottoms, and is so called because the waters\r\nfrom higher levels cut gulches in it. But it is rich land. On it grow\r\noak trees of a peculiar species. Their wood is almost as hard as iron,\r\nand their roots grow deep down. You can't cut them or dig them up.\r\nNow, general, how do you suppose the farmers treat them?\"\r\n\r\nThis was a poser.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Lincoln, \"they just let them alone and plough around\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nWith this the President arose and shook hands, and General Schenck\r\nreturned to Baltimore, pondering over the parable of the \"galled\r\nprairies.\"\r\n\r\nNothing further was said about censure, but Mr. Lincoln was troubled\r\non the score of his \"pledge,\" and did not let the matter drop.\r\n\r\nColonel Birney was very busy one day issuing the final orders for\r\ndespatching three boats to a point where, from information received,\r\nseveral hundred good recruits were waiting. He was interrupted by a\r\ntelegram direct from the White House, as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"How many slaves have you enlisted?\"\r\n\r\n                         (Signed)         \"ABRAHAM LINCOLN.\"\r\n\r\nThe answer reached the President while Governor Swann and his friends\r\nwere making another call on him.\r\n\r\n\"About three thousand,\" it said.[3]\r\n\r\nA short and, according to the report of the committee, a pretty sharp\r\ndiscussion followed the reading of this answer, ending in the despatch\r\nof another telegram to the colonel:\r\n\r\n    \"Hold on and care for what you have; enlist no more until\r\n    further orders.\r\n\r\n                         (Signed)          ABRAHAM LINCOLN.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Birney's disappointment can be imagined. In another hour his\r\nboats would have been off and out of reach of telegrams. Now, all\r\norders had to be countermanded and the boats tied up.\r\n\r\nThe next day the colonel went to Washington and had an interview with\r\nMr. Stanton, always his friend, and ready to do for him all that his\r\nposition towards the President permitted him to do.\r\n\r\nThe latter Colonel Birney did not see, but the encouragement,\r\nprotection, and aid he received from the great war secretary, with\r\nwhose patriotism mingled no selfish ambition, enabled him, after a few\r\nweeks, to reorganize his plans and continue the work which led to\r\nemancipation in the State of Maryland.\r\n\r\nA new order was issued, by consent of the President, authorizing the\r\nenlistment of slaves of rebels and of consenting loyal masters.\r\n\r\nThe final details of this novel recruiting business will be given in\r\nanother chapter.\r\n\r\n                                        CATHERINE H.

What a sweet shade that is!\r\n\r\nMAUD. Isn't it?\r\n\r\nETHEL. Are these the same price as the others?\r\n\r\n            [_Fingers the browns._\r\n\r\nNEWCOME. Exactly the same, madam; one dollar and fifty cents a yard,\r\nreduced from two and a half; all-wool.\r\n\r\nMAUD. Are you sure they are all-wool? This piece feels rather harsh to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nNEWCOME. Every thread, madam; that I will guarantee. We are not\r\nallowed to misrepresent anything in this establishment. You can see\r\nfor yourself.\r\n\r\n            [_Recklessly frays out a few inches of the brown._\r\n\r\nETHEL (_also fingering goods_). Yes, they are all-wool; French, did\r\nyou say?\r\n\r\nNEWCOME. Every piece imported. We keep no domestic woollen goods\r\nwhatever. We have no call for anything but the foreign goods.\r\n\r\nMAUD. How wide did you say?\r\n\r\nNEWCOME. Double width, madam--forty-four inches.\r\n\r\nETHEL. Five, seven--let me see, it would take about--how much do you\r\nusually sell for a costume?\r\n\r\nNEWCOME (_with hilarity, holding up the browns_). From eight to ten\r\nyards, madam, according to the size of the lady. For your size I\r\nshould say eight yards was an abundance--a great abundance.\r\n\r\nETHEL. She is just about my size, isn't she, Maud?\r\n\r\nMAUD. Just about. It wouldn't take eight yards, I shouldn't think, of\r\nsuch wide goods made in Empire style.\r\n\r\nETHEL. No, I suppose not; but then it's always nice to have a piece\r\nleft over for new sleeves, you know.\r\n\r\nMAUD. Yes, that's so.\r\n\r\nNEWCOME. An elegant shade, ladies, becoming to anyone, fair or dark. I\r\nam sure any lady must be pleased with a dress off of one of\r\nthese--serviceable, stylish, the height of fashion.\r\n\r\nETHEL. Is brown really so fashionable this season?\r\n\r\nNEWCOME. I am sure we have sold a thousand yards of these browns to\r\nten of any other color.\r\n\r\nMAUD. Is that so?\r\n\r\nETHEL. I do wonder if she really would prefer brown. What do you\r\nthink, dear?\r\n\r\nMAUD. Well, it depends somewhat, I think, on how she is going to have\r\nit made.\r\n\r\nETHEL. True. Well, I think she said in _directoire_.\r\n\r\nMAUD. Plain full skirt?\r\n\r\nETHEL. Yes, smocked all around--no drapery at all.\r\n\r\nMAUD. Candidly, love, do you like a skirt without any drapery at all?\r\n\r\nETHEL. Well, no, I can't say I do. Do you?\r\n\r\nMAUD. No. I like a little right in the back, you know--not too much.\r\nBut I think a little takes off that dreadfully plain look. Don't you?\r\n\r\nETHEL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMAUD. How are y-- I mean how is she going to have the waist?\r\n\r\nETHEL. I don't know. I heard her say that she was going to have a puff\r\non the sleeve.\r\n\r\nMAUD. At the elbow?\r\n\r\nETHEL. No, at the shoulder.\r\n\r\nMAUD. And revers, I suppose.\r\n\r\nETHEL. Yes, those stylish broad ones.\r\n\r\nMAUD. Of velvet?\r\n\r\nETHEL. Velvet or plush.\r\n\r\nNEWCOME (_who has been manfully holding the browns up above his head,\r\npermits them to gently descend_). We have a full line in plushes and\r\nvelvets, ladies, to match all these shades.\r\n\r\nMAUD. How nice!\r\n\r\nETHEL. So convenient!\r\n\r\nNEWCOME (_mildly_). Do you think you'll decide on the brown, madam?\r\n\r\nETHEL. Oh, dear! I don't know. It is so hard to shop for some one\r\nelse!\r\n\r\nMAUD. It is horrid.\r\n\r\nETHEL. I vow every time I do it that it shall be the last. I am always\r\nso afraid of getting something that the person won't like.\r\n\r\n            [_Sighs._\r\n\r\nNEWCOME. Any lady must like this brown, madam. Just feel the texture\r\nof this piece of goods, and take the trouble to examine the quality.\r\nWhy, I have never in all my experience sold a piece of goods of such a\r\nclass at a cent less than two dollars a yard--never.\r\n\r\nMAUD. It is very fine.\r\n\r\nETHEL (_vaguely eying the goods behind the counter on the shelves_).\r\nIs that a piece of claret-colored that I see up there?\r\n\r\nNEWCOME (_lays down the browns with a faint sigh of reluctance_). Yes,\r\noh, yes.\r\n\r\nETHEL. Never mind to get it down.\r\n\r\nNEWCOME. No trouble in the world to show anything; that's what I am\r\nhere for. (_Sighs as he attains the clarets and fetches them to the\r\ncounter._) Rich shades; ten tints in these also, calculated to suit\r\nany taste.\r\n\r\nMAUD. I always did like claret.\r\n\r\nETHEL. Yes, it is so becoming.\r\n\r\nMAUD. It has such a warm look, too!\r\n\r\nETHEL. Now, that--no, this one--no, please, that darker piece--yes.\r\nMaud, dear, that made up with plush and garnet buttons and\r\nbuckles--Oh, did I tell you I saw some such lovely garnet trimmings at\r\nBlank's last week, only seventy-five cents a yard, just a perfect\r\nmatch for this. Wouldn't it be too lovely for anything?\r\n\r\nMAUD. Indeed it would. I am almost tempted myself. Claret is my color,\r\nyou know.\r\n\r\nNEWCOME. A splendid shade, madam, and only just two dress lengths\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nETHEL. Is this the same goods as the others?\r\n\r\nNEWCOME. The very same; all-wool imported suitings, forty-four inches\r\nwide, reduced from two-fifty a yard to only one dollar and a half.\r\n\r\nMAUD. Wouldn't that be just perfect with that white muff and boa of\r\nmine, dearest?\r\n\r\nETHEL. Too startling, love. Do you know, I think you made a mistake in\r\ngetting that white set.\r\n\r\nMAUD. Why?\r\n\r\nETHEL. Too striking.\r\n\r\nMAUD. Do you think so?\r\n\r\nETHEL. Yes. Of course it's lovely for the theatre and opera.\r\n\r\nMAUD. It's awfully becoming.\r\n\r\nETHEL (_to Newcome_). Now, do you really sell as much claret color as\r\nyou do green or brown this season?\r\n\r\nNEWCOME. Oh yes, madam; if anything, more. You see claret is one of\r\nthe standards, becoming alike to young and old. Why, a child might\r\nwear this shade. Claret will always hold its own; there is a change in\r\nthe blues and the greens and the browns, but the claret is always\r\nelegant, and very stylish.\r\n\r\nMAUD. I think so too.\r\n\r\nETHEL (_meditatively_). I do wonder if she would like claret better\r\nthan brown.\r\n\r\nNEWCOME. I can show you the browns again, ladies.\r\n\r\nETHEL. Oh, never mind.\r\n\r\nNEWCOME. No trouble in the world. (_Holds up browns and clarets\r\nboth._) Now you can judge of the two by contrast.\r\n\r\nMAUD. Both lovely.\r\n\r\nETHEL. Which do you like best, love?\r\n\r\nMAUD. My dear, I don't know.\r\n\r\nNEWCOME. You can't go amiss, madam, with either of those, I am sure.\r\nAny lady must like either of them.\r\n\r\nETHEL. Oh, dear! I wish people would get well and do their own\r\nshopping; it is so trying!\r\n\r\nMAUD. Horrid!\r\n\r\nNEWCOME. An elegant piece of goods, madam; will wear like iron.\r\n\r\nETHEL. What would you do, dear?\r\n\r\nMAUD. I really don't know what to say. When does she want to wear it?\r\n\r\nETHEL. Dinner and theatre.\r\n\r\nMAUD. By gaslight, then?\r\n\r\nETHEL. Yes, of course.\r\n\r\nMAUD. Does the gaslight change the shade much?\r\n\r\nNEWCOME. Just a trifle, madam; it makes it richer.\r\n\r\nMAUD. Darker?\r\n\r\nNEWCOME. Just a half a tone.\r\n\r\nETHEL. Then that must be considered. Oh, dear!\r\n\r\n            [_Sighs plaintively._\r\n\r\nMAUD. Why not look at it by gaslight, love?\r\n\r\nETHEL. Oh, I hate to give so much trouble!\r\n\r\nNEWCOME. No trouble in the world, madam--a pleasure. I will gladly\r\nshow you these goods by gaslight, for I am confident you will only\r\nadmire them the more. Here, boy (_calls boy, and hands him a pile of\r\ngoods_), take these to the gaslight-room. This way ladies, please.\r\n(_They cross the aisle and enter the gaslight-room, preceded by the\r\nboy, who sets down the goods and retires._) There! look at that! Isn't\r\nthat a rich, warm, beautiful color!\r\n\r\n            [_Displays clarets._\r\n\r\nMAUD. Lovely!\r\n\r\nETHEL. Yes, lovely--but (_dubiously_) I am so afraid she won't like\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMAUD. It is very perplexing.\r\n\r\nETHEL. Yes. Oh, how sweet those browns do look in this light! Don't\r\nthey?\r\n\r\nNEWCOME. Ah, I just brought over the browns, madam, for I thought you\r\nmight care to see them too.\r\n\r\n            [_Displays browns._\r\n\r\nMAUD. How they do light up! Don't they?\r\n\r\nNEWCOME. Newest tints, every one of them. Not been in stock over a few\r\nweeks, and those browns have sold like wildfire.\r\n\r\nETHEL. For my own part I always did like brown.\r\n\r\nMAUD. Yes, so do I.\r\n\r\nETHEL. It's so ladylike.\r\n\r\nMAUD. Yes, and it's a color that is suitable to almost any occasion.\r\n\r\nETHEL. Yes. Now that lightest piece would be just too sweet, wouldn't\r\nit, made up with that new Persian trimming?\r\n\r\nMAUD. Exquisite! Say, do you know I priced some of that trimming the\r\nother day.\r\n\r\nETHEL. Did you? how much?\r\n\r\nMAUD. Awfully expensive! Five dollars a yard.\r\n\r\nETHEL. How wide?\r\n\r\nMAUD. Oh, not more than four inches.\r\n\r\nETHEL. It wouldn't take much, would it?\r\n\r\nMAUD. That depends on where you put it.\r\n\r\nETHEL. Well, just on the bodice and sleeves and collar.\r\n\r\nMAUD. About two yards and a half.\r\n\r\nETHEL. Fifteen dollars?\r\n\r\nMAUD. Yes.\r\n\r\nNEWCOME. This brown trimmed in the manner you mention, ladies, would\r\nbe very elegant.\r\n\r\nMAUD. Yes, so it would. I wish now that I had looked more particularly\r\nat the browns out by the daylight.\r\n\r\nNEWCOME. It is easy to look at them again, madam, I am sure. Here,\r\nboy, carry these goods back to the counter where you got them. (_Boy\r\ncrosses, laden with goods; Newcome and ladies follow._) That's it.\r\n(_Boy retires._) Now, madam, just look at that shade by this light.\r\nIsn't that perfect?\r\n\r\nETHEL. Yes, it's lovely, but--\r\n\r\nMAUD. Did she say she wished a brown especially, dear?\r\n\r\nETHEL. No, she left it to me entirely.\r\n\r\nMAUD. How trying!\r\n\r\nETHEL. Yes. I--I really, you know. I don't dare to take the\r\nresponsibility; would you?\r\n\r\n            [_Newcome's arms falter slightly in upholding the goods._\r\n\r\nMAUD. Frankly, my love, I think shopping for anyone else is something\r\ndreadful.\r\n\r\nETHEL. It is so trying and so embarrassing. I don't dare really to get\r\neither (_Newcome's arms fall helpless; he sighs_) one of them.\r\n\r\nMAUD. They are lovely, though; aren't they?\r\n\r\nETHEL. Yes, if (_Newcome revives a little_) I thought she would really\r\nbe satisfied.\r\n\r\n            [_He essays once again to hold up the browns._\r\n\r\nMAUD. But, dear, they never are. [_His arms again droop._\r\n\r\nETHEL. No, never. No matter how much trouble you take, or what pains\r\nyou are (_he sighs feebly_) at (_he totters_), they are so ungrateful.\r\n\r\nMAUD. Yes, always.\r\n\r\nETHEL. Well, I believe we can't venture to decide this morning (_he\r\nstaggers_) about the shade. We will very likely return to-morrow.\r\n\r\n            [_He raises a weakly deprecating hand._\r\n\r\nMAUD (_aside, as the two ladies are going_). Well, we got off quite\r\nnicely.\r\n\r\nETHEL. Yes, didn't we! I wouldn't be seen in either of those horrid\r\nthings; would you?\r\n\r\nMAUD. No.\r\n\r\n            [_Newcome falls to the earth with a groan of despair; the\r\n               Chorus rush forward and gently raise him in their arms.\r\n               As they bear him off, they sing, in a doleful and yet\r\n               half-malicious fashion_:\r\n\r\n_Chorus._\r\n\r\n            Poor Newcome!\r\n    You are not the first man they have ended,\r\n    And left on the cold ground extended;\r\n    Or to whom they have sweetly pretended,\r\n    On whose taste they have weakly depended;--\r\n    Whom they've left on the cold ground extended,\r\n    Minus money they never expended,\r\n    On goods that they never intended\r\n            To buy,\r\n            Heigh-o, heigh,\r\n            O--O--!\r\n\r\n            [_They retreat_, C., _as the ladies exeunt_, R., L. _Music\r\n               pianissimo as curtain falls._\r\n\r\n                                       FANNIE AYMAR MATHEWS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_IRISH NORAH TO ENGLISH JOHN._\r\n\r\n(Her theory of Home Rule under the Union.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"It manes, and shure and where's the harm?\"\r\n        Said Nora to her spouse;\r\n    \"It manes: if you must mind yer farm,\r\n        That I shall mind me house.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_BELLA'S BUREAU._[4]\r\n\r\nA STORY IN THREE SCARES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCARE THE FIRST.\r\n\r\nI almost flung myself into Dick Vandeleur's arms when he entered my\r\nlibrary that evening.\r\n\r\n\"Can you imagine why I sent for you in such a deuce of a hurry?\" I\r\nblurted out, embracing him effusively in my pleasure at seeing him.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I did think there might have been a woman in the case,\" he\r\ndrawled, in his deliberate way, stopping to adjust his neck-tie, which\r\nhad worked its way over his ear during the struggle. \"But then, as I\r\nhappened to have acted as your best man only two months ago, when you\r\nmarried the most charming of women, why, b'Jove, I--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it is a woman,\" I groaned, cutting his speech short.\r\n\r\n\"The devil!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and the very worst kind, I fancy, if thoroughly aroused.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, my deah boy, with such a wife it's--it's--it's--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it's all that and a good deal more,\" I growled, gloomily. \"Don't\r\nadd to my misery with your ill-timed reproaches. Richard, a back\r\nnumber of my unsavory career has turned up to deprive me of my\r\nappetite and blight my being. You remember Bella Bracebridge, of the\r\nnimble toes, at whose shrine I worshipped so long and so idiotically?\r\nWell, I received a letter from her only yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\"--incredulously.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!--little Bella who used to caper around in such airy garments at\r\nthe Alhambra?\"\r\n\r\n\"The very same. I only wish I could be mistaken,\" with a despairing\r\ngroan. \"It seems she married money and retired from the stage. By some\r\nmeans she disposed of her husband, and is now a rich and probably\r\ngood-looking widow. She has purchased an estate within half a mile of\r\nhere, and is going in heavy for style. She wants to make me the\r\nstepping-stone to social success; she sighs for the purple penetralia\r\nof the plutocracy. See what a predicament I am in! To introduce her in\r\nthis house would plant the most unjust suspicions in Ethel's\r\nVassarian mind, while her mother, Mrs. McGoozle, might institute\r\nawkward inquiries into the dear, dead past\"--with a shiver of\r\nanticipation. \"Now, my dear Vandeleur, that woman means mischief. She\r\nhas got about a hundred of my letters breathing the most devoted love:\r\nif dear Ethel got a glimpse of a line she would go into hysterics.\r\nBella has hinted, even politely threatened, that unless I show her\r\nsome attention, which means introducing her to my wife's circle of\r\nfriends, she will publish those letters to the world or send them to\r\nthe dramatic papers. Now you must help me out of this scrape.\"\r\n\r\n\"Delighted to be of any service, I'm sure,\" tapping his boots\r\nimpatiently with a jaunty little cane. \"But, really, you know, I don't\r\nsee--\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's easy enough. Don't you remember we were once the pride of\r\nthe school because we robbed watermelon patches so skilfully? What a\r\nnarrow shave that was in the apple orchard the night before\r\ncommencement, when you--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, I remember, deah boy; but what have those childish pranks\r\ngot to do with the present case? We don't want to rob an apple\r\norchard\"--by way of mild protest.\r\n\r\n\"It is another kind of fruit that we are after--the fruit of youthful\r\nfollies. Here,\" opening a cupboard and throwing out two pairs of\r\noveralls somewhat the worse for paint, two jumpers ditto, and several\r\nmuddy overshoes, \"Vandeleur, if you love me put these things on.\"\r\n\r\nI fancy I can see him now adjust his glass and survey me with bulging\r\neyes. I certainly did have nerve to ask that famous clubman, so\r\nirreproachable in his dress, to assume such inartistic and plebeian\r\ngarments.\r\n\r\nIt took a great deal of palavering before I could persuade him that I\r\nwas lost unless he consented. How he grunted as he reluctantly laid\r\naside his silk-lined white kersey coat and evening dress, and tried to\r\nput on the overalls with one hand while he held his aristocratic\r\naquiline nose with the other.\r\n\r\n\"Really, I hope I shan't be found dead in these togs,\" he remarked\r\nruefully, as he surveyed himself in the glass. \"What would Flossy say?\r\nand how the chaps at the Argentine would wonder what I'd been up to!\"\r\n\r\nI cut short his speculations by thrusting a soft slouched hat on his\r\nhead and dragging it down over his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"There now!\" I said, standing off and contemplating him critically\r\nand admiringly; \"you have no idea, my boy, how becoming this costume\r\nis. One might imagine you had been born a stevedore.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked rather sour at this doubtful compliment, and hitching up his\r\nbaggy trousers, asked, \"Well, what is the next misery?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is twelve o'clock,\" I said, referring to my watch. \"My wife has\r\ngone to bed. Like Claude Duval, we will take to the road.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a stiff libation of brandy and soda we stole softly downstairs\r\nand found ourselves in front of the house. Only one light glimmered in\r\nthe black pile, where Ethel was going to bed.\r\n\r\n\"Where away?\" asked Vandeleur, as I turned the path.\r\n\r\n\"To storm Bella's bureau,\" I cried, leading the way through the dark.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCARE THE SECOND.\r\n\r\nWith much difficulty we found ourselves at last in the spacious\r\ngrounds of Bella's estate. I had laid my plans carefully the day\r\nbefore, and there seemed no possibility that they would miscarry. By\r\nliberal fees I had learned from her butler that she was to spend that\r\nnight in New York with a friend, and for a further consideration he\r\noffered to leave one of the drawing-room windows open so that we\r\nshould have a clear field.\r\n\r\nEverything seemed to be working beautifully, and I already felt the\r\ncoveted letters in my grasp. We found the French window ajar, and with\r\ntremulous hearts stepped over the sill and into the room. After\r\nseveral collisions with the furniture, of which there seemed to be\r\nwhat we thought an unnecessary amount, we finally scraped our way into\r\nthe hall.\r\n\r\nHere was a quandary. We were in a hall, but what hall? Whether the\r\nstairs led in the right direction there was no one present to consult.\r\nWe walked or rather crawled up them, nevertheless. I tried the first\r\ndoor on the landing, and was rewarded with \"Is that you?\" by a female\r\nvoice that sent us scuttling along the passage in undignified haste.\r\n\r\nWell, at last, after many narrow escapes from breaking our necks, we\r\nreached Bella's room. I knew it the moment I saw the closet full of\r\nshoes. Bella was always proud of her feet, and had, I believe, a pair\r\nof boots for every hour of the day.\r\n\r\nTo make things even more sure that I had arrived at the chaste temple\r\nof my former flame, there was the famous bureau of ebony inlaid with\r\nivory--that bureau which contained enough of my inflammatory letters\r\nto reduce it to cinders.\r\n\r\n\"Can you regard that bureau with equanimity?\" I exclaimed,\r\nunconsciously assuming a dramatic attitude. \"Does it not recall your\r\nvanished youth--the red horizon of your adolescence? Ah,\" I cried,\r\novercome by the sight of that familiar bit of furniture, \"how often\r\nhave I slid a piece of jewelry into that top drawer as a surprise for\r\nBella! Her delighted shriek which followed the discovery rings in my\r\nears even now. Oh, halcyon days of happy holiday, mine no more, can a\r\nlifetime with a funded houri wholly fill your place?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all very well,\" cried Vandeleur, who can assume a disgustingly\r\npractical tone when he wants to. \"While you are rhapsodizing here over\r\nyour poetical past, some stalwart menial may arrive with a\r\nblunderbuss, and fill our several and symmetrical persons with No. 2\r\nbuckshot. Perhaps Bella may have missed her train or her friend. She\r\nmight return here at any moment and surprise us\"--looking around him\r\nuneasily.\r\n\r\n\"Anybody would think that you had never been in a boudoir at this time\r\nof night,\" I retort savagely.\r\n\r\nI begin to pull out the drawers of the bureau, breaking locks in the\r\nmost reckless way, and tossing the contents of these dainty\r\nreceptacles about in the most utter confusion. Vandeleur, with his\r\neyeglass adjusted, is poking into everything in the closet as if he\r\nwere looking for a mouse, only pausing now and then to glare around\r\nwith an apprehensive shiver.\r\n\r\n\"Dear me,\" I soliloquize, while the contents of those bureau drawers\r\nare tossed here and there in the fever of my search. \"How everything\r\nhere reminds me of the past! She has even preserved the menu card of\r\nthat memorable dinner at Torloni's; and here--here is a lock of brown\r\nhair tied with a pink ribbon! I really believe it must be mine!\"\r\n\r\n\"My deah boy,\" howls Vandeleur, shaking me by the arm vigorously,\r\n\"will you cut short your soliloquy? Is this a time for poetry, when we\r\nmight get ten years if we were found burglarizing this house?\"\r\n\r\nI pay no attention.\r\n\r\n\"And here is the steel buckle from her shoe that fell off the night we\r\ndanced together at the French ball. Poor dear Bella! that was not the\r\nonly dance we led where folly played the fiddle!\"--with a thrill of\r\nreminiscence.\r\n\r\n\"If you don't find those letters in just two minutes,\" interrupts the\r\ndreadful Vandeleur, \"I shall post for home.\"\r\n\r\n\"In one second, my boy--one second.\"\r\n\r\nNow I examine the bureau carefully for a concealed drawer. I seem to\r\nhave ransacked every corner of that precious article in vain. Visions\r\nof Bella's vengeance flash before my eyes. I can see the demoniac\r\nsmile on her face as she gloats over my downfall. The white wraith\r\nconjured up by the thought of those fateful letters fills me with a\r\nmad fury, and I long to dash that hateful bureau into a thousand\r\npieces and flee the house.\r\n\r\nBut the demolition could not be executed noiselessly, and the\r\nsituation is perilous enough already for a man of my delicately\r\norganized constitution, with a heart that runs down with a rumble like\r\na Waterbury movement; so I think I won't break the bureau.\r\n\r\nI renew my mad search for the missing drawer, that seems to be of a\r\nmost retiring disposition, as drawers go. I bethink me of stories of\r\nmissing treasure: how the hero counted off twenty paces across the\r\nfloor, and then dropped his dagger so that its blade would be imbedded\r\nin the wood, and then dug through several tons of masonry, until he\r\nfound a casket, sometimes of steel, sometimes of iron, and sometimes\r\nof both.\r\n\r\nAnd then he did a lot more mathematical calculating, and pressed a\r\nknob, and there you are! Ah! a thought--I had forgotten to apply\r\nmyself to the moulding of the bureau, as a hero of the middle ages\r\nwould have done under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nI begin from side to side, up, down, and around. Ha! ha! at last! A\r\nlittle drawer shoots out almost in my face, startling me like a\r\njack-in-the-box.\r\n\r\nA faint perfume of crushed violets salutes my nostrils. The\r\nletters--they are there in the bottom of the drawer! I know them too\r\nwell by the shape of the square large envelopes. They cost me many a\r\ndollar to send through the stage-door by the gouty Cerberus at the\r\ngate when Bella trod the boards.\r\n\r\nI reach out my hand to seize them, when an awful scream causes me to\r\nstagger back in dismay.\r\n\r\nBella Bracebridge, in a jaunty travelling dress, stands in the doorway\r\nin the attitude of a tragic queen--her eyes flashing, her bosom\r\nheaving, just as she looked the day she asked for a raise in salary\r\nand didn't get it.\r\n\r\nShe steps towards me: I retreat, transfixed by her defiant attitude.\r\nShe fear a common burglar? Never!\r\n\r\nI know she intends to seize me and scream for help, and I am afraid,\r\ntoo, that she may recognize my face. So I step back--back, edging\r\ntowards the window.\r\n\r\nShe reaches out her hand to seize me, then totters and falls in a dead\r\nfaint.\r\n\r\nI look around for Vandeleur. He has lost all presence of mind; is\r\nstaring at the figure on the floor, with wild, dilated eyes, and an\r\nexpression of hopeless idiocy on his face. I can hear people moving\r\nbelow stairs. Her scream must have aroused the house. \"Vandeleur,\"\r\nshaking him by the arm, \"we must run for it. Do you understand? Ten\r\nyears! Hard labor!\"--the last words hissed excitedly in his ear.\r\n\r\n\"What? where? who?\" he mumbles, with a face as expressive as that of\r\ncodfish.\r\n\r\nI rush to the balcony to see if we can make the jump below. It is\r\ndark, but the leap must be made. Better a broken leg than a ball and\r\nchain on a healthy limb for years and years.\r\n\r\nI drag Vandeleur in a helpless condition out on the balcony, boost him\r\nup on the railing, and push him off. Then I leap after him.\r\n\r\nFortunate fate! We fall into a clump of blackberry bushes, and not a\r\nmoment too soon. Lights flash out from above. I hear the hum of\r\nexcited voices, Bella's calm and distinct above the rest, as she gives\r\nthe ominous order, \"Let those bloodhounds loose!\"\r\n\r\nUgh! We scramble out of the bushes in the most undignified haste,\r\nleaving most of our outward resemblance to human beings on the thorny\r\ntwigs. Then helter-skelter over the fields and hedges, stumbling,\r\nstaggering, and traversing what I suppose to be miles of country.\r\n\r\nVandeleur is snorting like a steam calliope in bad repair, and I am\r\nbreathing with the jerky movement of an overworked accordion. \"I can\r\ngo no farther,\" he exclaims, dropping down in a huddled heap at the\r\nfoot of a scrubby pine-tree like a bag of old clothes.\r\n\r\nI don't feel much in a hurry either, but I try to infuse some life\r\ninto him by hustling him and shaking him in a brutal and unsympathetic\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\"Do you hear that?\" I howl in despair as the baying of the bloodhounds\r\nrolls towards us over the meadow like muttered thunder. \"There is\r\nnothing to do but climb this tree, unless you want to furnish a free\r\nlunch for those brutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Free lunch? get me some,\" he mumbles, relapsing into his old idiotic\r\nstate again. Then I fall upon that unfortunate man in a fury of rage,\r\nand pound him into a consciousness of his danger.\r\n\r\nHe consents at last to be pushed or rather dragged up in a tree, whose\r\nlowest limb I straddle with a feeling of wild joy and ecstasy just as\r\nthe hounds rush past below, their flashing eyes looking to me just\r\nthen as large as the headlights of a host of engines.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go home now,\" again murmurs the helpless creature at my side,\r\nshaking so on the limb that I am compelled to strap him there by his\r\nsuspenders.\r\n\r\n\"Ain't we going home?\" he chatters. \"I want a good supper, and then a\r\nbed--_bed_,\" lingering on the last word with soothing emphasis.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you'd like a nice supper, would you?\" I growl. \"Well, those\r\nbloodhounds are after the same thing. Perhaps you had better slide\r\ndown the tree and interview them on the chances. Then one or the other\r\nof you would be satisfied.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they've gone away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you needn't think you have been forgotten, just the same. Don't\r\nyou see, wretched man, that the morning is breaking,\" pointing to the\r\neast, where the sun had begun \"paintin' 'er red.\" \"Once in the high\r\nroad we should be discovered at once; here at least we are\r\nsafe--uncomfortably safe,\" as I moved across the limb and impaled\r\nmyself on a long two-inch splinter with spurs on it.\r\n\r\nHe fell into a doze after that, only rousing himself now and then to\r\nutter strange croaking sounds that frightened me almost as much as the\r\nbaying of the bloodhounds. I think I fell asleep too for a few\r\nmoments, for when I was roused by an awful yell proceeding from my\r\ncompanion I found that he had burst his bonds and fallen out of the\r\ntree, while the bright sun was shining in my eyes.\r\n\r\nVisions of Ethel's face over our charming breakfast-table rose before\r\nme, and I seemed to scent afar off the steam of fragrant mocha in a\r\ndainty Sèvres cup as she held it towards me. The thought of that\r\nmorning libation settled the business.\r\n\r\nI would march stalwartly home--yea, though a thousand bloodhounds with\r\ndangerous appetites barred my way!\r\n\r\nI slid down the tree and found Vandeleur still asleep. I don't believe\r\nthat even the fall had waked the poor fellow up.\r\n\r\nI had only to whisper the word \"Breakfast\" in his ears to have him\r\nstart as if he had received a galvanic shock.\r\n\r\n\"Where?\" he asked, with tears in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Home.\"\r\n\r\nWe crawled along through the bushes in the wildest haste our poor\r\ndisjointed and almost dismembered bodies would carry us; like a pair\r\nof mud-turtles who had seen better days did we take to all-fours.\r\n\r\nFortunately, my place was not far away, and we had just strength\r\nenough to crawl up on the porch and fall against the door heavily.\r\n\r\n\"Breakfast,\" I gasped, as Ethel's lovely face appeared suddenly at my\r\nside like a benignant angel's.\r\n\r\n\"What--what can I get you?\" murmured the dear girl, in an agony of\r\nmind, hurrying here and there, her eyes suffused with tears.\r\n\r\n\"Bloodhounds!\" murmured Vandeleur, relapsing into idiocy.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCARE THE THIRD.\r\n\r\nIf you have ever had the fortune to be married to a Vassar graduate of\r\nthe gushing and kittenish order, between nineteen and twenty, you will\r\nunderstand how difficult it was to explain my dilapidated appearance\r\nthat memorable morning.\r\n\r\nThe ingenuity of my fabrications would have stocked a popular romance\r\nwriter with all the modern conveniences; and I am sure the recording\r\nangel must have had difficulty in keeping pace with my transgressions\r\nunless he or she understood short-hand.\r\n\r\nVandeleur took an early opportunity to escape to the city, knowing\r\nvery well that he would be held accountable for my degraded and\r\ndilapidated condition. The friends of a married man always are held\r\nresponsible by his wife for any of his moral lapses, no matter when or\r\nwhere they may occur.\r\n\r\nIf I had only succeeded in my undertaking I might have viewed even my\r\nwounds--of which there were many--with some equanimity. But to have\r\nsuffered in vain was enough to try the strongest soul; and I am afraid\r\nI was unnecessarily brusque to Ethel when she insisted on soaking me\r\nhourly in the most horrible liniments of her mother's decoction. I was\r\npickled for about a week by her fair hands, and had become so\r\nimpregnated with camphor and aromatic compounds that I exhaled spices\r\nlike an Eastern mummy or a shopworn sachet-bag, and longed to get away\r\nfrom myself and the drugstore smell that clung to me closer than I\r\never want my brother to cling. I consented to the embalming process,\r\nbecause I wanted to look respectable when Ethel's mother, Mrs.\r\nMcGoozle, put in an appearance. I knew I could not so easily satisfy\r\nher mind regarding that night of folly without the sworn affidavits of\r\nhalf-a-dozen reputable citizens. She said I wrote so much fiction\r\nthat it had become a habit with me never to tell the truth.\r\n\r\nMy eyes had just begun to lay aside mourning when I received at the\r\ndinner-table one stormy night the local paper. I took it for my wife,\r\nwho had a penchant for reading the patent-medicine advertisements; but\r\non the present occasion I displayed an unholy eagerness to get at its\r\ncontents. More misery! More horrible complications!\r\n\r\nAlmost the entire sheet was given up to a description of the burglary.\r\nThere was a picture of Bella's house and of Bella herself; of the\r\ncook, of the coachman--yes, and even of the bloodhounds.\r\n\r\nI had puzzled my brain since that night in trying to imagine why the\r\nhounds had sped past our tree, our noble tree, instead of gathering in\r\nconvention at its base and talking the matter over among themselves\r\nwhile we starved to death upstairs. The paper gave the solution of the\r\nproblem. They were pursuing the trail that led to our milkman's\r\nfarm--the poor creature of whom I had basely borrowed our suits and\r\novershoes.\r\n\r\nThe worthy man had been arrested and haled before the nearest justice\r\nof the peace, and had he not been able to prove an _alibi_ to the\r\neffect that he was watering his cows at the time, he would have been\r\nsummarily dealt with.\r\n\r\nBut he had held his peace about my share in the transaction--bless\r\nhim! and being a thrifty man, had brought a suit against Bella for\r\nthreatening his life with her dogs.\r\n\r\nYet I had no cause for congratulation, for now I was in the milkman's\r\npower as well as Bella's; and the very next day the honest fellow put\r\nin an appearance, very humble and yet very decided, and insisted that\r\nI should present him with Ethel's prize Frisian cow as a premium on\r\nhis silence.\r\n\r\nAnd I had to consent, though my wife had hysterics in parting with the\r\nanimal, and sobbed out her determination to tell Mrs. McGoozle\r\neverything when that lady arrived in a few days.\r\n\r\nThis may not sound very terrible to you, but I knew the dreadful\r\nimport of her words.\r\n\r\nThere was a flash of light through the gloom of my suicidal thoughts\r\nthe next morning that made my heart beat high with hope.\r\n\r\nI read in the morning paper that Bella, the cause of all my trouble,\r\nwas dead, and that there was to be a sale of her effects at a New York\r\nauction-room the next day.\r\n\r\nOf course that dreadful bureau was in the lot, and I knew that if it\r\nfell into unscrupulous hands there was enough material in that little\r\ndrawer to stock a blackmailing establishment for years and years.\r\n\r\nI took the first train for the city on the day of the sale. The\r\nbureau--Bella's bureau--was just being put up as I entered the place.\r\n\r\nI had a thousand dollars in my pocket, so I felt rather contented in\r\nmind. The bidding on the bureau began in a discouraging way. The\r\nhunger of the crowd had been appeased before I came, and they\r\ndisplayed a lukewarm interest in the bureau. I bid two hundred dollars\r\nfinally to settle the argument. I was tired of the delay. I wanted to\r\nsettle forever the incubus that preyed upon my spirits. \"Two hundred,\"\r\nI cried exultantly.\r\n\r\n\"Three hundred dollars,\" came in quiet tones from the corner of the\r\nroom. The words seem to ripple in an icy stream down the back of my\r\nneck. Could it have been the echo of my voice that I heard?\r\n\r\n\"Four hundred,\" I cried uneasily. The terrible thought flashed over\r\nme, that perhaps another lover had turned up, who believed that his\r\nletters were in the bureau, and was just as anxious to get it as I.\r\nHorrible!\r\n\r\n\"Four hundred is bid for this beautiful Louis Fourteenth bureau,\"\r\nhowled the auctioneer, repeating my bid. \"Why, gents, this is a shame:\r\nit's--\"\r\n\r\n\"Five hundred,\" said the voice from the corner, in calm, cold tones.\r\n\r\nAh, if I could slip through the crowd and throttle his utterance\r\nforever.\r\n\r\n\"Six hundred,\" I screamed, in desperation.\r\n\r\nThen my unseen foe woke up and we began to bid in earnest. Six, seven,\r\neight hundred, ran the bids.\r\n\r\nIn one of the lulls of the storm, when the auctioneer began to wax\r\nloquacious regarding the beauties of that bureau, I slipped secretly\r\naround to the cashier's desk.\r\n\r\nWould he take a check? I implored. No, he would not; and I thought he\r\nwore a triumphant glitter in his fishy eyes. The terms of the sale\r\nwere cash: it was to conclude that day. I turned away, sick at heart.\r\n\r\n\"A thousand!\" I cried, in desperation, staking my last dollar. There\r\nwas a moment's ominous silence. I began to feel encouraged. I watched\r\nthe fateful gavel poised in the air, with my heart in my teeth. It\r\nwavered a moment, then began to slowly descend. Never had I seen such\r\na graceful gesture defined by man as the freckled fist of the\r\nauctioneer described at that moment of hope.\r\n\r\n\"Twelve hundred,\" croaked the demon in the corner.\r\n\r\nThe crowd blended into a pulp of color. I fainted.\r\n\r\nI lingered about the city all that night, searching in vain for a\r\nlethean draught at the haunts where consolation is retailed at two\r\nhundred per cent profit. I did not find the nepenthe I sought for\r\nanywhere on draught, so I went home in disgust.\r\n\r\nEthel received me in her usually effusive manner. She knows I object\r\nto being hugged at all hours of the day, yet I have never been able to\r\ncure her of that affection-garroting process so much in vogue with\r\nyoung wives of the gushing order.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think?\" she chirped, when I had staggered to a chair in a\r\nhalf-strangled condition. \"Dear mother has just sent us the most\r\nbeautiful present--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I suppose so,\" I sneer savagely. \"She generally does present us\r\nwith something beautifully useless. Perhaps this time it's a\r\ndancing-bear, or a tame codfish\"--with a wild laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how can you talk so!\" lifting a dab of cambric to her nose with a\r\npreliminary sniff that is generally the signal of tears, according to\r\nour matrimonial barometer. \"You know dear mother is so fond of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's a case of misplaced affection,\" I growl, lounging out of\r\nthe room just in time to avoid the rising storm.\r\n\r\nI dash upstairs and smoke a cigar in my own room. Then I feel better,\r\nand stroll into Ethel's boudoir, resolved to pitch her mother's\r\npresent in the fire if it doesn't suit me. She ought to be suppressed\r\nin this particular. \"Wha--what! No--yes, it is!\" The bureau, Bella's\r\nbureau, stands in the chaste confines of Ethel's satin-lined nest. I\r\nfling myself upon it, tear the little drawer open--hurl the bundle of\r\nletters into the grate with a cackling laugh.\r\n\r\nEthel enters timidly just then, and looks first at me and then at the\r\nburning papers with doubt and wonderment in her blue eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I have been paying some old debts,\" I say, with an uneasy laugh.\r\n\"These are some of the I.O.U.'s you see burning.\"\r\n\r\nShe lays a soft little arm around my neck and a curly head on my\r\nimmaculate shirt-front. Oh, spotless mask for such a darksome heart!\r\nI wonder she cannot catch the sound of its wicked beating.\r\n\r\n\"I have been worried about you lately, dear,\" she whispers, with a\r\ntender tremor in her voice. \"I thought perhaps you might--you\r\nmight--have become entangled with some other--other--\" Then she burst\r\ninto tears.\r\n\r\n\"How often must I tell you, darling,\" patting her cheek softly, \"that\r\nyou are the only woman I ever loved?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Jack!\"\r\n\r\n                                   ERNEST DE LANCEY PIERSON.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[4] The rights of dramatization of this story are reserved by the\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A SHOT ON THE MOUNTAIN._\r\n\r\n\r\n    An eagle drifting to the skies\r\n    To gild her wing in sunset dies,\r\n      To float into the golden,\r\n    To swing and sway in broad-winged might,\r\n    To toss and heel in free-born right,\r\n      High o'er the gray crags olden.\r\n\r\n    A dark bird reaching on aloft,\r\n    Till far adown her rugged croft\r\n      Lies limned in misty tracing--\r\n    Till, riding on in easy pride,\r\n    Her cloud-wet wings are ruby pied,\r\n      Are meshed in amber lacing.\r\n\r\n    An eagle dropping to her cave\r\n    On dizzy wing through riven air,\r\n      A bolt from heaven slanted;\r\n    A startled mother, arrow-winged,\r\n    A mountain copestone, vapor-ringed,\r\n      An eyry danger-haunted.\r\n\r\n    An eagle slanting from the skies\r\n    To stain her breast in crimson dyes\r\n      Beneath the gilt and golden;\r\n    A shred of smoke--the gray lead's might--\r\n    A folded wing--the dead bird's right--\r\n      Abreast the gray crags olden.\r\n\r\n    The blush light fades along the west,\r\n    The night mist rolls to crag, to crest,\r\n      To cowl the ghostly mountain;\r\n    Black shadows hush the eyry's calls;\r\n    Below, a broad brown pinion falls--\r\n      The last light from the fountain.\r\n\r\n                                               J. W. RUMPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_EDITORIAL DEPARTMENT._\r\n\r\n\r\nPURIFYING THE POLLS BY LAW.\r\n\r\nThe edifying efforts made by Congress to throw guards about the ballot\r\nwould be encouraging were they based on a little knowledge of the\r\nfact, and the reason for it. As it is, the _be-it-enacted_ agreed on\r\nis little better than a solemn protest. Our learned law-makers would\r\nenjoy greater progress if they would remember that we have had for a\r\ncentury all the law necessary to punish such corruption, and that the\r\ntrouble lies in our inability to enforce its provisions.\r\n\r\nWhat is really wanted is a tribunal to try and enforce the stringent\r\nenactments already in existence. This does not now exist. When a\r\ncandidate for Congress corruptly purchases enough votes to secure his\r\nreturn to either House, he knows that such Chamber, being the judge of\r\nsuch applicant's qualifications, forms a court without a judge to give\r\nthe law or an impartial jury to render a verdict. The Committee on\r\nElections in either House is made up of the Democratic or Republican\r\nparty, and so the jury is packed in advance.\r\n\r\nThis is not, however, the only evil feature in the business. There is\r\nprobably no organized body so ill-fitted for adjudication upon any\r\nsubject as Congress. Returned to place by parties, the members are\r\nnecessarily partisans. Their tenure of office is so brief that they\r\nhave no time in which to learn their legitimate duties through\r\nexperience, and these duties are so numerous, to say nothing of being\r\nencroached upon by services entirely foreign to their positions, that\r\nthey have no opportunities for study. The consideration then of any\r\nsubject from a judicial point of view is simply impossible. It is\r\n\"touch and go\" with them, and the _touch_ is feeble, and the go\r\nhurried. It seems that a case of purely judicial sort has no place in\r\nCongress; and yet we have seen an instance--for example, in the New\r\nIdria contention--where the courts had been exhausted, from an Alcalde\r\nto the Supreme Court of the United States, and yet the complainant,\r\nworsted in every one of these tribunals, came through the lobby into\r\nCongress, and for over ten years kept that body in a tumult. Of course\r\nthis was kept alive by the corrupt use of stock to the extent of ten\r\nmillions, based on the credit of a company that would be such when\r\nCongress gave its illegal approval. This fact alone proves the\r\ndangerous and uncertain character of a legislative body that takes on\r\njudicial functions.\r\n\r\nWhen a contested election goes before the standing committee called\r\ninto existence as a court, it passes into a secret committee-room,\r\nwhere the so-called evidence, put on paper, is supposed to be\r\nconsidered. What would be said of a jury impanelled avowedly from the\r\nparty of one side, and then made into a court to sit and deliberate\r\nwith closed doors against the public?\r\n\r\nIt is true that the finding is shaped into a report and goes before\r\nthe House. But no member of that body, especially of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, has either time or opportunity to read the evidence,\r\nor even to listen to the arguments made by contestants upon the floor.\r\nThat tribunal has lost all power in its loss of public confidence. It\r\nnot only brings the law into contempt, but itself into such disrepute\r\nthat its findings are worthless. This is the condition of Congress in\r\npublic opinion. So far as contested elections are concerned, it is\r\nregarded with contempt. To make matters worse, and pay a premium on\r\nvice, the losing party is allowed the same mileage and pay given his\r\nsuccessful competitors.\r\n\r\nIf all contests were turned over to the United States courts, to be\r\ntried in the locality where the wrong complained of was done and the\r\nwitnesses live, there would be few contested elections, and some\r\nchance given to punish bribery and other corruption.\r\n\r\nAgain, the prohibition against the subscription or payment of money\r\nhas exceptions that open wide the doors to corruption. To say that\r\nmoney may be used for any purpose is to leave the evil precisely where\r\nthe law-makers found it. It were better to have the government furnish\r\nthe tickets, as the government supplies the ballot-boxes, rents the\r\npolling-places, and pays the officials for their services. The ballot\r\nis as much a necessity to the machinery of election as the boxes; and\r\nbecause it would be difficult and troublesome to supply them is far\r\nfrom saying that it is impossible.\r\n\r\nThen, to punish both bribe-giver and bribe-taker in the same way is to\r\nthrow a guard about the iniquitous transaction. The bribe-taker should\r\ngo acquit. Of course this would be in a measure opening a door to\r\nblackmailers, and make the candidacy extremely dangerous. Such it\r\nought to be. The sooner we put a check on the shameless solicitations\r\nfor office the better it will be for the Republic. Let the offices, as\r\nof old, in the purer days of the fathers, seek the man--and not the\r\nman, as now, the offices. If the effect of this would be to drive\r\ntimid, decent men from office, it would not be worse than the present\r\nsystem. A candidate for the House of Representatives must not only pay\r\nhis two years' salary in advance to \"heelers,\" as they are called, but\r\nmust get drunk in every saloon in his district. We cannot make matters\r\nworse, and there is a chance in a change for an improvement.\r\n\r\nTrue reform to be effectual must be radical. A compromise with evil is\r\na surrender to hell. To cut a poisoned shrub even to the ground\r\nrelieves the eye for a time, but the root is made more vigorous by the\r\ntrimming. The constitutional governments of Europe have rid themselves\r\nof bribery and other corruption by digging out the roots. This is the\r\nonly course open to us. When members of the House can bribe their way\r\nto place, when Senate chairs are sold in open court, when it calls for\r\nonly two millions to purchase the Presidency, and all done by men of\r\nhigh social position, we have reached the lowest level, and our great\r\nRepublic is a mere sham and a delusion. We are not menaced with the\r\nloss of liberty and guaranteed rights. They are gone.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MUGWUMP ELEMENT.\r\n\r\nThe purchase of the Presidency in open market, now generally\r\nrecognized, is less disheartening than the apathetic indifference in\r\nwhich such corruption is regarded by the people. In all communities\r\nmen may be found to buy, and men to sell, the sacred privilege upon\r\nwhich our great Republic rests; but it is rare--so rare that this\r\nexperience is almost without precedent--that good citizens, knowing\r\nthe nature of their free institutions, are willing to have them\r\ndestroyed without an effort in behalf of their preservation.\r\n\r\nTo get at not only the fact but the reason of it we must remember that\r\npolitics to the average citizen has all the fanaticism of religion,\r\nand all the fascination of gambling. We have the country divided in\r\ntwo hostile camps, and in these organizations themselves we have lost\r\nthe objects for which they were organized. This is the tendency of\r\npoor human nature the world over. It is probably more pronounced in\r\nreligion than in any other form. A man will not only fight to the\r\nbitter end, but die as a martyr, for a sect whose dogmas he has never\r\nread, or, if read, fails to comprehend. Politics is our popular\r\nreligion. Taking the great mass of our citizens, we are pained to\r\nwrite that it is about our only religion.\r\n\r\nWe say that we have two hostile camps, in both of which the objects\r\nfor which they were organized have been entirely lost. The ordinary\r\nRepublican can give no reason for being such save that he is not a\r\nDemocrat, and the Democrat has the same reason, if it may be called\r\nsuch. Each will avow, without hesitation, that the other camp is made\r\nup of knaves and fools. The folly of thus designating over half our\r\nentire voting population does not strike the partisan.\r\n\r\nParties, however, are not called into existence and held together\r\nthrough intellectual processes. They are founded on feeling. For years\r\nand years the brightest minds and purest characters preached, with\r\nburning eloquence, upon the wrongs of negro slavery, and got ugly\r\nepithets and foul missiles in return, if indeed they were listened to\r\nat all. At a moment of wild frenzy an armed mob at Charleston shot\r\ndown our flag. In an instant the entire people of the North rose to\r\narms, and a frightful war was inaugurated. The flag sentiment\r\noutweighed the Abolition arguments.\r\n\r\nIt is not our purpose to give the philosophical view of that contest.\r\nWe use it only, so far, in illustration. The sectional feeling that\r\nbrought on that armed contest continues in another direction, and\r\ndivides the two great parties. It is so intense that each is willing\r\nto see the republic under which we live utterly destroyed, so that one\r\nmay be conquered or the other defeated.\r\n\r\nWe are all agreed that the ballot is the foundation-stone of our\r\nentire political structure. On this was built the form of government\r\ngiven us by the fathers, and was the grand result of all the blood and\r\ntreasure, of life and property, so patriotically poured out in the\r\nRevolution that made us independent. Yet this ballot is openly\r\nassailed, its processes corrupted with money, and its usefulness\r\nentirely destroyed, without arousing the indignation of an outraged\r\npublic. Men of wealth, of high social position, members of churches,\r\nand leaders in what are called the better classes, subscribe and pay\r\nthe money knowingly that is to be used in the purchase of \"floaters in\r\nblocks of five\" or more, while voters, well-to-do farmers, and\r\nso-called honest laborers are organized willingly into blocks and\r\nshamelessly sell that upon which they and their children depend for\r\nlife, liberty, and a right to a recompense for toil. When the result\r\nis announced bonfires are burned, and loud shouts go up amid the roar\r\nof artillery, expressive of the joy felt in such a triumph.\r\n\r\nThese men of means--it makes no odds how the means are\r\naccumulated--are not aware that in this they are cutting away the\r\nfoundations under their feet, and that, too, with ropes about their\r\nnecks. Their only security, not only to the enjoyment of their\r\nproperty but to their lives, lies in the very government they are so\r\neager to destroy. We have called attention to the fact that humanity\r\nsuffers more from an inequality of property than from an inequality of\r\npolitical rights. These last are rapidly getting to be recognized and\r\nsecured in constitutions throughout the civilized world. Kings and\r\nemperors have come to be mere figure-heads above constitutions, and\r\nthe political dignity of the poor man is generally acknowledged. But\r\nthe poor man remains, and the castle yet rears its lofty front above\r\nthe hovels of the suffering laborers. Humanity is yet divided between\r\nthe many who produce all and enjoy nothing, and the few who produce\r\nnothing and enjoy all. This is the inequality of property, and\r\ngovernments yet hold the sufferers to their hard condition. It is\r\ncalled \"law and order,\" as sacred in the eyes of the Church as it is\r\npotent in courts of justice.\r\n\r\nThere is no government so poorly fitted to the execution of the hard\r\ntask of holding labor down as this of the United States. In Europe\r\nthrough the dreary ages the masses have been born and bred to their\r\nwretched condition. With us, on the contrary, there has been a great\r\nexpenditure of toil and treasure to teach labor its rights. In Europe\r\ngreat armies are organized and kept upon a war footing for police\r\nduty. We have no such conservative force upon which to rely in our\r\nhour of peril, and yet so far our government has held sway through our\r\nhabitual respect for that which we created. These wealthy corruptors\r\nare rapidly destroying this respect. They are teaching the people that\r\ntheir ballots are merchantable products, and their ballot-box a rotten\r\naffair.\r\n\r\nViolence follows fraud as surely as night follows day, or a\r\nthunderstorm a poisoned atmosphere. The day is not distant when these\r\nmillionaires will be hunting holes in which to hide from the very mobs\r\nthey are now so assiduously calling into existence. God in his divine\r\nmercy forgives us our sins when we are repentant, but the law that\r\ngoverns our being--called nature--knows no forgiveness. The wound\r\ngiven the sapling by the woodman's axe is barked over, but that cut,\r\nslight as it seems, remains, and may hasten decay a hundred years\r\nafter. The wrong done the body politic may fester unseen, but it\r\nfesters on all the same.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the people there is yet a feature in the situation\r\nthat gives us hope. We are blessed with no inconsiderable body of men\r\nof sufficient sense and conscience to rise above party control and\r\nvote in support of good measures and honest, capable men. These are\r\nnot men dominated by one idea, and devoted to some one measure that is\r\nto remedy all our political ills. These are \"cranks,\" so called,\r\nbecause they believe that human nature is constructed like\r\nmachinery--something like a coffee-mill that has a crank that, if\r\nturned and turned vigorously, will put the entire machine in good\r\nrunning order. To some this is temperance, to others the tariff, to a\r\nthird our common-school system: and so they give their lives to a\r\nvociferous demand for help to turn the one peculiar crank.\r\n\r\nWe refer, not to such as these, but the thoughtful, patriotic few who\r\nrise above party obligations to a consideration of their country's\r\ngood. These men are not organized into a party,--unless the fact of\r\ntwo men thinking and feeling alike make a party,--and, as compared to\r\nthe Republican and Democratic camp-followers, are few in number. But,\r\nin the evenly divided condition of the two organizations, these men\r\nhold the balance of power, and are dreaded in consequence. Had it not\r\nbeen for the money used by Republicans, and the treachery practised by\r\na few leading Democrats, these independents would have given New York\r\nto the Democracy, and Grover Cleveland would be President for the next\r\nfour years.\r\n\r\nThese men are derided, scoffed at, and held in high disdain by the\r\npartisans of both parties. They are called Mugwumps; and when this\r\nstrange epithet is hurled at them the assailant seems to feel\r\nrelieved. This is no new thing. Among the traditions of the Church is\r\none to the effect that as the devil talks he spits fire. All reformers\r\nare treated to this. It is well remembered that in the troublous times\r\nof '61 the Mugwumps, then denounced as Abolitionists, came to the\r\nfront and carried the government through its dark hour of peril to a\r\ntriumphant close. They were brave, brainy, patriotic men, not\r\ndisturbed by the abuse heaped upon them.\r\n\r\nWe are comforted to observe the power of these few men as proved in\r\nthe debate on the civil-service law of the House when an appropriation\r\nwas called for to sustain the Commission. The debate proved what we\r\nall know--that probably not a member of the House but regards the\r\nreform in utter loathing and wrath. And yet, when the vote was taken,\r\nbut a small minority were willing to put themselves on record in\r\nopposition. The same clear appreciation of the evil consequences\r\nattending this corruption of the ballot, and the conscience that makes\r\nitself felt as that of the people, are forcing a reform in that\r\ndirection. The time is not distant when the now much-reviled Mugwumps\r\nwill be regarded, as are the Abolitionists, as the true patriots of\r\nthe day. God would have forgiven Sodom and Gomorrah could five\r\nrighteous men have been found in either city: this not out of regard\r\nfor the five, but from the evidence afforded that if that number\r\nexisted, these wicked places could not be altogether lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR HOUSE OF LORDS.\r\n\r\nThe dignity of this unnecessary and disagreeable body was somewhat\r\ndisturbed by a Senator in a wild state of intoxication, who from his\r\nplace in the Chamber assailed in unseemly language the presiding\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\nGreat consternation fell upon the British House of Commons when the\r\ndiscovery was made that an entire session had been gone through\r\nwithout \"that bauble,\" as Oliver Cromwell called it, being upon the\r\ntable. When Doctor Kenealy, friend and attorney of the Tichborne\r\nClaimant, was about being sworn in as a member of Parliament, it was\r\nobserved that he had a cotton umbrella under his arm. A horror too\r\nprofound for utterance fell upon the House, and all proceedings were\r\narrested until the obnoxious compound of cotton and whalebone was\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nWe refer to these events for the purpose of impressing upon our\r\ndelegated sovereigns from sovereign States, that unless the\r\nproprieties are preserved their dignity cannot be maintained. What\r\nwould be thought of the British House of Lords if Lord Tomnoddy, for\r\nexample, were to roll in very drunk, and make personal remarks\r\ntouching the integrity of the presiding officer? The thought of such\r\nan event threatens insanity. The British Empire would totter, the\r\nthrone shake, and the House of Lords disappear forever.\r\n\r\nThe inebriated Senator was not arrested, or even rebuked. We all know\r\nwhy. On his one vote depends the Republican control of the Senate. To\r\nseize upon, arrest, and cart away, under charge of drunken and\r\ndisorderly conduct, the Republican majority of the Senate was so\r\npreposterous as not to be entertained.\r\n\r\nAs force could not be used, strategy was resorted to, and the\r\ninebriate Solon was invited out to take more drinks, in the hope that\r\na little more liquid insanity would render him _hors de combat_.\r\n\r\nThis is not the first instance of embarrassment of like sort. When the\r\nmen who organized the Star Route dishonesty of the Post-office\r\nDepartment were indicted, it was found that the head and front of this\r\noffending was a United States Senator. He held the one vote that gave\r\nhis party its supremacy in the Senate. To send the Republican majority\r\nvote to the penitentiary was not to be thought of--and so the court\r\nwas packed to acquit.\r\n\r\nA body that subordinates its dignity to the supremacy of a party\r\ncannot long retain that awe-inspiring respect so necessary to its\r\nexistence. Our House of Lords should bear in mind that the only\r\nreason--if such it may be called--for its existence, is in this\r\ndignity. If the Senate is not the holy, embalmed mummy of a dead king\r\nonce known as State sovereignty, it is naught; therefore, when a\r\nSenator endangers this title to existence by unseemly conduct, either\r\nas an inebriate or as a bribe-taker, he should be incontinently\r\nexpelled. The expulsion should be conducted with great ceremony. He\r\nshould be divested of his robes in the presence of the august\r\nbody--robes being procured for the occasion. One might be borrowed\r\nfrom the Supreme Court. Then the culprit should be conducted by two\r\nassistant Sergeants-at-Arms, one having hold of each arm. The\r\nSergeant-at-Arms should march behind, bearing the mace. We believe the\r\nSenate has that utensil; if not, that of the House of Representatives\r\ncould be procured. At the main entrance the Sergeant-at-Arms should\r\nfetch the mace into a charge, and planting the eagle in the small of\r\nthe culprit's back, thrust him out. All the while the chaplain, in a\r\nsolemn but distinct voice, should read the Service for the Dead.\r\nAfter, the presiding officer should give three distinct raps of his\r\nivory gavel, and say in joyous but decorous voice, indicative of\r\ntriumphant yet seemly satisfaction: \"The expurgated Senate will now\r\nproceed with the business of legislating for the House of\r\nRepresentatives.\"\r\n\r\nSo necessary is dignity to the existence of this august body, that the\r\npresiding officer should have an eye continually to it; and when a\r\nSenator, in debate, makes himself ridiculous, he should at once be\r\ncalled to order. When, for example, the Hon. Senator from Vermont (Mr.\r\nEdmunds) gave his grotesque picture of a common American laborer being\r\npossessed of a piano, and a wife in silk attire, in his own cottage\r\nhome, he should have been promptly called to order. The presiding\r\nofficer should have remarked that the picture, being imperfect, was in\r\na measure untrue, and as such could not be entertained by the Senate.\r\nThe Senator, however, has the privilege of amending his sketch by\r\nsaying that the laborer has not only the luxury found in a piano and\r\nsilk-clad wife, but a mortgage on the premises. This, although\r\nimprobable, is not impossible for a common laborer; and if the Hon.\r\nSenator will vouch for the fact that he knows one such, his statement\r\nmay go on record for what it is worth.\r\n\r\nThis would serve to abridge the liberty of speech guaranteed to us by\r\nthe Constitution. But we must remember that the same larger freedom\r\nexercised in a bar-room, or upon the streets, or on the floor of the\r\nHouse of Representatives, is a menace to the dignity of the Senate;\r\nand in view of this, freedom of speech is somewhat circumscribed.\r\nWhen, therefore, the Hon. Senator from Indiana (Mr. Voorhees) shakes\r\nhis senatorial fist at the Hon. Senator from Kansas (Mr. Ingalls), and\r\ncalls him an anathematized offspring of a female canine, or words to\r\nthat effect, he fractures the dignity of the Senate, and further\r\nadjudication does not turn on the truth of the utterances as in a\r\ncourt, for we are forced to remember that it is one-half of the\r\nsovereign State of Indiana shaking its fist at one half of the\r\nsovereign State of Kansas. This is very like the old story of the\r\nsheriff of Posey County, Kentucky, who being agitated in a robust\r\nmanner by an angry citizen, called on his assailant to desist, as he\r\nwas \"shaking all Posey County.\"\r\n\r\nHow long the practical common-sense citizens of the United States\r\nwill submit to this worn-out superstition of a Senate is a question\r\nthat strikes every thoughtful mind. The body was born of a narrow\r\nsectional feeling, long before steam navigation and railroads made the\r\ncontinent more of one body than was a single colony before the\r\nRevolution; and was a concession to State sovereignty, with the new\r\nand accepted principle of home rule found in State rights. It further\r\nconfuses and demoralizes the civil rule of the majority under the\r\nConstitution, as it gives to Rhode Island or Delaware the same power\r\nheld by New York or Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nIt was believed by the framers of our government that it would be a\r\nconservative body, and serve as a restraint upon the popular impulses\r\nto be expected from the House. This has not proved to be the fact. The\r\ntenure of office given a Senator is of such length that it weakens the\r\nonly control found in public opinion, and this august body is more\r\nextravagant, corrupt, and impulsive than the more popular body at the\r\nother end of the Capitol. If any one doubts this, let such doubter\r\nfollow any appropriation bill, say that highway robbery called the\r\nRiver and Harbor Appropriation, or pensions, from the House to the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nThe Senate has long since survived its usefulness, if it ever had any;\r\nis to-day an object of contempt; and the sooner we have done with it\r\nthe better off we shall be.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR DIPLOMATIC ABSURDITY.\r\n\r\nThere is a deep-felt apprehension indulged in by a class of our\r\ncitizens over the grave diplomatic complication found in the dismissal\r\nof Lord Sackville West, and the refusal on the part of Her Gracious\r\nMajesty of England to refill the vacant post at Washington with\r\nanother lord. Our national dignity is menaced so long as Mr. Phelps,\r\nenvoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary residing at or near\r\nSt. James's, is permitted to remain. As soon as Sackville \"got the\r\nsack,\" to use a vulgar but expressive phrase, a reasonable time should\r\nhave been given Her Gracious Majesty to fill the place; and failing,\r\nthe Hon. Phelps should have been promptly recalled. This would have\r\nbeen hard on the Hon. Phelps, but with our flag insulted and our eagle\r\nscoffed at by an empty legation at the national capital, the Hon.\r\nPhelps should have been prepared to wrap the star-spangled banner\r\nabout his diplomatic body and die--if need be--to the fierce screams\r\nof the eagle. He might, after such a glorious demise, have been\r\nconsigned to that corner of Westminster Abbey that Dean Stanley\r\nreserved for a distinguished American. It is true that we, in common\r\nwith the American people, have designated Senator Ingalls as the one\r\nselected for that honor, and we are prepared to kill him any time, and\r\nforward his remains to the spot, provided the Westminster people are\r\nwilling to receive them. But this is carrying us from our diplomatic\r\nmutton.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances, it is a comfort to know that all this\r\napprehension of these sensitive citizens is quite uncalled for. This\r\nbecause we have no diplomatic service, no diplomatic agents, and\r\ntherefore no complications to speak of.\r\n\r\nThe framers of our government, through some oversight, neglected to\r\nsupply us with a diplomatic service. They saw, it is true, no use for\r\nsuch; nor was it possible to have a government as a trust, and give it\r\nsuch powers.\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic service pertains exclusively to a personal government.\r\nIt originated in a sovereign delegating certain powers, attributes of\r\nthe crown, to official agents whose duty was to reside near the courts\r\nof other sovereigns, keep a watchful eye upon their movements, report\r\nthe same to their masters, and, from time to time, negotiate treaties\r\nof advantage to their own sovereigns. To give these diplomatic agents\r\ndignity and influence they were clothed with sufficient power to\r\ncommit their sovereigns to their official acts. This is not possible\r\nwith us. The sovereignty in our great republic is in the people; and\r\nit finds expression, in this direction, through the Executive and\r\nSenate. It cannot be delegated. When, therefore, a treaty is\r\nnegotiated between us and any foreign power, it is necessary to send a\r\nspecial envoy to Washington to deal with the Executive. This has to be\r\nsanctioned by the Senate: and our absurd House of Lords has served\r\nnotice on the world that the President himself cannot commit our\r\ngovernment to any treaty.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, are our diplomatic agents, so called, sent abroad as\r\nministers? Ministers resident and _chargés d'affaires_ are merely\r\nclerks of the State Department--no more, no less--who are sent abroad\r\nto play at being diplomatists and get laughed at by the courts they\r\napproach.\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic corps of Europe, being an important part of their\r\nseveral governments, is made up of men possessed of fine intellect and\r\ngreat culture. To meet and associate with such, we send prominent\r\npoliticians who, being such, are ignorant of their own government, its\r\nhistory and character, let alone those of Europe; and they are\r\ntolerated from a good-natured wish to be agreeable, where there is no\r\nprofit in being otherwise. We do not suffer in this so much from our\r\nlack of good breeding--for it is difficult for a prominent American to\r\nbe other than a gentleman--as we do from the ignorance of our official\r\nagents. Ex-President Grant, for example, in his famous trip round the\r\nworld, posed at every court he approached as a royal personage.\r\nGeneral Badeau (\"Adjutant-in-waiting\"), acting as grand master of\r\nceremonies, arranged the household, and exacted from all comers the\r\netiquette due a sovereign. If our good citizens could have known the\r\nripple of laughter and ridicule that followed the result, in which our\r\ngreat man was spoken of as \"the King of the Yankee Doodles,\" they\r\nwould be more ashamed than proud of the performance.\r\n\r\nIt is this ignorance of ourselves and our political fabric that places\r\nus in a false position before the world. The clerk of the State\r\nDepartment sent abroad by our government as a diplomatic agent,\r\ninstead of putting up at a hotel and opening an office in a common\r\nbusiness way, sets up an establishment and \"takes on airs.\" As most\r\nof the diplomatic business is done in a social way, he attempts to\r\nentertain on a salary entirely inadequate to such work. As a court\r\ncostume is necessary--which means the sort of livery the diplomatic\r\nagent affects in the presence of his own sovereign--and as we, having\r\nno king, have no livery, our department clerk borrows one, either from\r\nsome European court or the theatre, and dances attendance in that.\r\n\r\nNo man ever stood higher in the estimation of the world, on account of\r\nhis genius, than James Russell Lowell. That esteem was considerably\r\nshaken, in the eyes of an admirer, when, calling on his minister at\r\nLondon, he found the poet's slender legs encased in tights, and his\r\nlittle body clad in a gorgeous coat covered with gold buttons. Of\r\ncourse, Mr. Lowell could masquerade in any dress and remain the\r\nbrilliant poet and patriot; but the significance of this livery, its\r\nshallow pretence and humble admission, made the admirer sick.\r\n\r\nThe clerk of our State Department sent abroad under this state of\r\nfacts finds nothing to do. He is not interested in the business of the\r\nforeign diplomatic corps; and if he were, his government has no hand\r\nin the game, nor is the agent sufficiently instructed to take part\r\neven were he interested. He is tolerated by those with whom he comes\r\nin contact, and his strange associates repay their good-nature by the\r\namusement they get out of the poor fellow.\r\n\r\nThere is no provision in our government for such an absurdity. The\r\nframers of our Constitution provided none; and if our recollection\r\nserves us right, it was not until 1856 that Congress recognized its\r\nexistence by a law fixing the rank and compensation.\r\n\r\nThe thing ought to be abolished. When Andrew Jackson was first elected\r\nPresident, he went to Washington fully resolved to put an end to the\r\nabsurd business. The politicians were too much for Old Hickory--and so\r\nthey are to-day too much for common-sense, the letter and spirit of\r\nour government, and the dignity of our people. With a House of Lords\r\nat home and a so-called diplomatic corps abroad, we are an object of\r\ncontempt from the rising of the sun till the setting thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE PASSING SHOW._\r\n\r\n\r\nSensationalism in art, as in literature, no doubt has its uses. It\r\nserves to present old truths in a new light, and by a startling\r\ngrouping of ascertained facts helps to overcome the inertia of the\r\naverage man and make him think. There is a value in novelty, provided\r\nit is rightly used, which is an important aid to the playwright or\r\nscenic artist. But where sensationalism is manifested by a distortion\r\nof facts, a falsification of history, or a violation of the principles\r\nof human nature, its effect is demoralizing both to the artist and the\r\nspectator, the author and the reader. Such an innovation has been\r\nattempted by Mr. Henry Irving and Miss Ellen Terry in their\r\npresentation of \"Macbeth\" at the Lyceum Theatre, London. It is\r\nexcellent acting, faithful reproduction of historic costumes,\r\nexquisite scenery, but--it is not Shakspere. Nor is it human nature.\r\n\r\nHad it been only occasional alterations of the dramatist's lines, or\r\neven the unnecessary division of the play into six acts instead of\r\nfive, or the cutting out of some of the characters, the genius of\r\nIrving and Terry might have been pardoned the perversion. But when\r\nthey attempt to represent the ambitious, plotting, fiendish murderess\r\nwhom Shakspere has depicted, as a loving, devoted wife, who only seeks\r\nto further a little job of killing for the purpose of promoting her\r\nhusband's interests, they meet with an infallible critic in the heart\r\nof every intelligent spectator. It is against human nature, and no\r\namount of wonderful declamation or scenic magnificence can gloss it\r\nover. The purpose of art is to portray nature, to refine it if you\r\nwill, but never to contradict. Lovers of the drama will be bitterly\r\ndisappointed that Mr. Irving, after having devoted the best years of\r\nhis life to the former, should at this late day, for the mere sake of\r\ninnovation, resort to the latter.\r\n\r\nShakspere, the great philosopher of human nature as well as the\r\ngreatest dramatist of the centuries, knew full well that unlawful\r\nambition which includes crime excludes the tender, womanly devotion of\r\nthe true wife, and, far from picturing Lady Macbeth as an admirer of\r\nher husband, shows her as sneering at him for his want of courage:\r\n\r\n                    \"Yet do I fear thy nature;\r\n    Is too full o' the milk of human kindness.\"\r\n\r\n                          \"Hie thee hither,\r\n    That I may pour _my_ spirits in thine ear.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this:\r\n\r\n                                    \"We fail.\r\n    But screw your courage to the sticking-place.\"\r\n\r\nIrving and Terry's play is not human nature and is not Shakspere; but,\r\noverlooking these points, their conception is well carried out. It is\r\na wonderful spectacle. The resources of stage machinery have been\r\ntaxed to their utmost, and the English press is one chorus of\r\nadmiration at the marvellous landscapes, and at the quaint\r\nornamentation and the low, groined arches of the old Saxon castle. It\r\nis a pity that these valuable adjuncts were not called unto the aid of\r\na more correct interpretation of the great ideal.\r\n\r\nAnd now we are likely to have an epidemic of Macbeths. Margaret Mather\r\nhas tried it at Niblo's, and Mrs. Langtry has been incubating a new\r\npresentation, like Terry's, with a \"few innovations.\" Irving's\r\nreputation as a stage manager is such that when his \"Macbeth\" comes to\r\nAmerica everyone will want to see it.\r\n\r\nBut will it ever come to America? For now, forsooth, there are some\r\nmembers of the dramatic profession in this country who avow their\r\nintention of appealing to Congress to regulate American taste by law,\r\nand to exclude foreign actors under the contract-labor statute. This\r\nbrilliant idea originated in the fertile brain of Mr. Louis Aldrich,\r\nand was nursed by the Actors' Order of Friendship. Into this Order\r\nMessrs. Booth and Barrett were initiated with darkened windows and\r\nmysterious rites, for the express purpose of fixing the stamp of their\r\napproval upon the scheme. A delegation appeared before Congressman\r\nFord's Immigration Committee and begged that the proposed undemocratic\r\nexclusion law shall contain a provision against the landing of foreign\r\npauper actors.\r\n\r\nBut these gentlemen lacked in logic what they possessed in assurance.\r\nThey were willing to except \"stars\" from the operation of the law.\r\nWell, why not exclude \"stars\"? Do they not compete quite as much with\r\nAmerican talent as the humbler aspirants of the stage? Even a \"star\"\r\nof the magnitude of Louis Aldrich himself would probably find his rays\r\noutshone in the presence of the brighter effulgence of an Irving or a\r\nCoquelin. It is the \"stars\" who compete most with native talent, and\r\non this principle they should be the first excluded. Besides that, if\r\nthey are excepted, who is to define a \"star\"? It would be amusing to\r\nsee the Supreme Court of the United States gravely sitting in judgment\r\non such a question. By all means, Mr. Aldrich, return at once to\r\nWashington and amend your petition. Let Mr. Ford include \"stars\" also\r\nin his bill. And then let every protectionist crank in the country\r\nhave absolute exclusion of every possible competitor and of all kinds\r\nof goods that he wants to sell, and pay a bounty to the farmers for\r\ntheir crops, and then we shall all be able to raise ourselves by our\r\nboot-straps into a region of perfect happiness.\r\n\r\nOf course there are two sides to every question, and, not wishing to\r\ndo an injustice, we will give the one maintained by the petitioners.\r\nWe have a law prohibiting the importation of labor contracted for\r\nabroad. This law the courts hold is applicable to cooks, coachmen, and\r\nministers of the Gospel. Now why should an exception be made in behalf\r\nof a theatrical manager who contracts for a lot of actors, more or\r\nless cheap, in London, to play for him in the United States? Mr.\r\nAldrich does not ask that the man, be he star or stock, who comes of\r\nhis own motives shall be prohibited; but he does protest against the\r\nimportation of the cheap histrionic labor which is brought here,\r\nprecisely as other skilled or unskilled labor is got over, to compete\r\nwith the same labor in the United States. In other words, it is not a\r\nquestion of taste, but one of bread.\r\n\r\nAnother fact is overlooked that has a decided bearing on the question.\r\nIn all matters of art we are such a set of snobs that we cannot\r\nrecognize any merit in our artists until after they have been indorsed\r\nby English critics and English audiences. If any law can be enacted to\r\ncorrect this miserable condition, let us have it at an early day. We\r\nknow that the greatest actress known to the English-speaking\r\nworld--our Clara Morris--has failed to secure the fame and fortune to\r\nwhich her genius entitled her simply because she neglected to secure\r\nEnglish approbation--which would have been heartily given her had she\r\never appeared in London.\r\n\r\nNor is it true that English stock is preferred to the American\r\nproduct because of its superior excellence. Mr. Daly has shown the\r\nabsurdity of this claim by taking his admirable company to London and\r\ncarrying off the honors. In the face of this and every other fact, we\r\nare told that the English comedian doing the society drama is superior\r\nto ours because of his superior social position. That is something to\r\nbe relegated to the things which amuse. There is an adaptability about\r\nthe American that makes him at home in all conditions. It is possible\r\nfor an American actor to wear a dress suit with an ease that is\r\nrivalled only by the French. What is the good of calling on an\r\nEnglishman to do on the stage what no Englishman can accomplish in\r\nprivate life? If there is a John Bull on earth who can wear a dress\r\nsuit with ease and elegance, he has not yet been discovered.\r\n\r\nThere now, we have given both sides.\r\n\r\nMr. Edwin Booth offered his brother-actors a much better kind of\r\nprotection when, on New Year's Eve, he presented to them \"The\r\nPlayers'\" club-house, with its fine library and its treasures of\r\ndramatic art. After all, education and self-development are the only\r\nlegitimate means of attaining success; and he who offers his\r\nfellow-beings facilities for improvement and self-help is a far\r\ngreater benefactor to them than he who endeavors to apply restrictive\r\nmethods. Such an institution has been Mr. Booth's dream for years. It\r\nis a spacious house at No. 16 Gramercy Place, adjoining the residence\r\nof the late Samuel J. Tilden. Mr. Booth purchased it for $75,000, and\r\nspent $125,000 in alterations. The library is probably the finest\r\ncollection of dramatic literature in the world. Twelve hundred volumes\r\nwere presented by Mr. Booth, and two thousand by Lawrence Barrett,\r\nbesides a large number of rare works given by Augustin Daly, T. B.\r\nAldrich, Laurence Hutton, and others. It was a touching scene when, a\r\nfew moments before the old year died, Mr. Booth placed in the hands of\r\nAugustin Daly for the Players' Club the title-deeds to this\r\nmagnificent property, and blushing like a girl before the assembled\r\nactors, listened awkwardly to the simple words which Mr. Daly spoke in\r\nreply. Then just after the midnight bells had rung he turned and lit\r\nthe Yule log, and the players began the enjoyment of their new home.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards Mr. Booth closed his very successful\r\nmetropolitan engagement at the Fifth Avenue Theatre with \"The Fool's\r\nRevenge,\" Lawrence Barrett appearing in \"Yorick's Love,\" and both the\r\ntragedians started on a Southern tour.\r\n\r\nMiss Mary Anderson appears in a late issue of a sensational\r\npublication as a severe censor of society ladies addicted to attempts\r\nupon the stage. We say Mary Anderson; for her name appears at the end\r\nof the article, and as she is a woman, we will not venture to say that\r\nthe property claimed is not her own. Some rude critics have charged\r\nthat Mary did not make this up out of her own fair head; and\r\nthroughout the profession a state of mind exists that is not\r\ncomplimentary to the would-be authoress.\r\n\r\nThe queerest part of the business, however, is, that such strictures\r\nshould come from Miss Anderson. She raided the stage as a society\r\nwoman, and struck at once for the honors. There was, if we remember\r\nrightly, no long, weary preparation and laborious training for the\r\nfootlights. She went from the parlor to the greenroom, and she went in\r\nwith a flourish. She was of Kentucky birth, and Henry Watterson, whose\r\nbright intellect is only surpassed by his good heart, not only\r\nindorsed the ambitious society girl, but made up his mind to put Mary\r\ndown the American throat whether the people would or not. Mary was not\r\nunpalatable to the American taste, but Watterson is her father--that\r\nis, dramatically speaking.\r\n\r\nThen Stepfather Griffin came in. Stepfather Griffin was born a\r\ntheatrical advance and advertising agent. He did not know this. If we\r\nwere to dwell on what Stepfather Griffin does not know, we should fill\r\nall the space of this magazine for the year.\r\n\r\nP. Griffin \"caught on\" to the provincial condition of our artistic,\r\nliterary, and dramatic life, which makes the approval of England\r\nnecessary to American success. So Poppy G. transported his American\r\nstar to London. He found the Prince of Wales necessary; and\r\nLabouchere, M. P. and proprietor of _Truth_, taught the paternal agent\r\nhow to work the oracle. The Prince of Wales is a corpulent,\r\ngood-natured son of Her Gracious Majesty who rules all the earth save\r\nIreland. He is ever open to the advances and blandishments of an\r\nAmerican woman, or African woman, or any sort of woman, provided she\r\nis lovely; and being approached, he expressed his desire to know the\r\nstar of Columbia. \"Now,\" said Labouchere, \"having got that far, the\r\nthing to startle England and capture Americans is for Mary to decline\r\nan introduction on high moral and republican grounds.\" This was done,\r\nand Great Britain was startled and the Yankee Doodles were captured.\r\nShe returned to her native land with an English troupe, and made\r\nYankee Doodle go wild.\r\n\r\nNow Mary is absolutely the worst actress ever sent sweeping from the\r\ndrawing-room to the footlights. Possessed of a tall, angular figure,\r\nand blessed with a sonorous and in some respects pliable voice, she\r\nhas the fatal gift of imitation. No actor can win the highest honors\r\nof his exalted profession who is a mimic. The actor capable of giving\r\nexpression to the thought of his author really assists that author in\r\nthe creation of a character. He or she is the creator. Now the mimic\r\nis one who reproduces second-hand the work of others. We are cursed\r\nwith a traditionary assortment of characters that have come down to us\r\nfrom the Kembles; and any one capable of filling what Shakspere or\r\nBacon or somebody called the rôle of \"a poor player who struts and\r\nfrets his hour upon the stage, and then is heard no more\" can win\r\napplause through mimicry, but never be great. We first saw Mary as Meg\r\nMerrilies, and the reproduction of Cushman was something marvellous.\r\nAnd so we have had it ever since. As Fechter said of Booth's Hamlet,\r\nthat \"he played everybody's Hamlet but his own,\" so it may be said of\r\nMiss Anderson, that she reproduces in an acceptable way the wearisome\r\nline of old characters that have come to be stage properties.\r\n\r\nMrs. James Brown Potter, who has been playing to New York and Brooklyn\r\naudiences in Tom Taylor's heavy drama, \"'Twixt Axe and Crown,\" shows\r\nconsiderable improvement over her acting of one year ago, but she\r\nchose a very inappropriate piece for her reappearance. Mrs. Potter\r\nreads her lines very well, is a very beautiful woman, and possesses\r\nthat indispensable adjunct of the modern actress, a very handsome\r\nwardrobe. But she is not fitted for the part of Lady Elizabeth, who in\r\nher youthful prison exhibits the same wilful capriciousness and\r\nheadstrong pride that she afterwards showed on England's throne. Mr.\r\nKyrle Bellew as Edward Courtenay, the romantic lover of Elizabeth,\r\nplayed his rôle quite well. Mrs. Potter is naturally better suited to\r\nfragile, feminine, girlish parts than she is to the heroic, and there\r\nis plenty of room for improvement; but she is painstaking, persistent,\r\nand has time before her.\r\n\r\nEdward Harrigan's drama of \"The Lorgaire,\" the only new play of the\r\nmonth, is a passable sketch of Irish life. It is much more ingeniously\r\ndevised than any of his previous efforts in this line, and since it\r\nwas first put upon the stage has been much improved, many offensive\r\nlines being eliminated.\r\n\r\nAdolph Müller's new comic opera, \"The King's Fool,\" was first\r\nwitnessed by an American audience in Chicago at the Columbia Theatre\r\non Christmas Eve. Its scene is laid at the court of Pampeluna, and the\r\nplot is the development of a conspiracy to secure the succession to\r\nthe throne, the rightful heir being brought up as a girl, the Salic\r\nlaw forbidding the accession of females. The king's fool discovers the\r\nimposition, the young prince regains his throne, and the conspirators\r\nare punished.\r\n\r\nA very enjoyable selection of pieces has been put on the boards at\r\nDaly's Theatre, including \"The Lottery of Love,\" \"Needles and Pins,\"\r\n\"She Would and She Wouldn't,\" and \"Rehearsing a Tragedy.\" Ada Rehan\r\nscored her usual successes. Daly's Theatre is one where the spectator\r\nis always sure of a pleasant evening's entertainment. At the Standard\r\n\"Miss Esmeralda\" replaced \"Monte Cristo, Jr.\" The new play was in\r\nevery way brighter and wittier, and offered more opportunities to the\r\ntalents of Nellie Farren and the admirable Gaiety Company. Margaret\r\nMather in her repertoire produced at Niblo's Garden shows steady\r\nimprovement. She makes a lovely Juliet, but in the difficult part of\r\nPeg Woffington she is a failure. The \"Yeomen of the Guard\" is\r\nwithdrawn from the Casino, not from any lack of popular favor, but\r\nbecause Manager Aronson has been obliged by a contract to restore\r\n\"Nadjy\" to the stage. Herr Junkermann has been giving several very\r\ncreditable presentations at the new Amberg Theatre, to the delight of\r\nour German citizens.\r\n\r\nMost admirable, yet most difficult and incomplete, was the first\r\nproduction in America of Wagner's \"Rheingold\" at the Metropolitan\r\nOpera House early in January. The stage machinery was very\r\ncomplicated, and the illusions were perfect. As the curtain rose the\r\ndepths of the Rhine waters appeared to fill the scene, the sun's\r\nstruggling rays caused the precious gold to gleam; and the three Rhine\r\nmaidens appointed by Wotan to watch it were seen gracefully swimming\r\nabout the treasure. From this novel opening to the close, when the\r\ngods cross the rainbow bridge that leads to Walhalla, the scenery was\r\na marvel of spectacular effect, but it did not rise to the excellence\r\nof the displays at the Bayreuth festivals. The orchestra was in best\r\nform, and the singing was the best that has been presented this\r\nseason--much better, for instance, than in the previous performance of\r\n\"Siegfried,\" where Herr Alvary's voice showed signs of wear, and Emil\r\nFischer actually became hoarse before the close.\r\n\r\n\"Faust,\" \"The Huguenots,\" \"L'Africaine,\" and \"Fidelio\" were among the\r\nmusical triumphs of the Metropolitan. Handel's \"Messiah\" was\r\nbeautifully given at the same theatre by the Oratorio Society, with\r\nthe Symphony Society's orchestra, under the direction of Walter\r\nDamrosch; while concerts by the Boston Symphony orchestra, by Theodore\r\nThomas, and by Anton Seidl complete the list of delightful musical\r\nentertainments of the season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_REVIEWS._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLOVEN HOOF UNDER PETTICOATS: _The Quick or the Dead_; _Eros_;\r\n_Miss Middleton's Lovers_.--The characteristic American novel of the\r\nday might be described as an episode clothed in epigram. It is\r\ncommonly little more than an incident, slight as to plot, startling in\r\ncontrasts of light and shade, and too often avowedly immoral in\r\ntone--a fragment of canvas, with ragged edges, cut at random from a\r\npicture by Gérôme, with figures questionably suggestive, and volcanic\r\nin color. It affects a myopic realism in details, not seldom of the\r\nsort which, with non-committal suavity, we have agreed to call\r\n\"improper.\" It is nothing if not erotic. It deals with humanity from\r\nthe anatomist's standpoint, and describes, with insistence and\r\nreiteration, the physical attributes of its characters, leaving the\r\nspiritual to be inferred from their somewhat indefinite actions, and\r\nthat sort of mental sauntering which is termed analysis, for want of a\r\nbetter name. It sets its women before you in the language of the\r\nslave-market. It leaves no doubt in your mind that they are\r\nfemale--female to a fault. \"You could not help feeling in her presence\r\nthat she was a woman; the atmosphere was redolent with her. You never\r\nso much as thought of her as a human being, a sentient, reasoning\r\npersonage like yourself. She was born to be a _woman_ solely, and she\r\nfulfilled her destiny.\" \"She was sensuous and voluptuous. You received\r\nfrom her a powerful impression of sex.\" \"She was a naked goddess--a\r\npagan goddess, and there was no help for it.\" Realistic this may\r\nindeed be, but it is hardly chivalrous, or consistent with that\r\nrespect which well-bred and sound-hearted men feel, or, for the\r\nconvenience of social intercourse, affect to feel toward that half of\r\nhuman nature to which the mothers, sisters, and wives of the race\r\nbelong. A woman must be philosophical indeed who can accept as a\r\nflattering testimony to her personal graces such a phrase as \"She is\r\nthe most appetizing thing I have seen.\" To be regarded in the light of\r\na veal cutlet may possess the charm of gastronomic reminiscence, but\r\nas a metaphor it is scarcely poetic.\r\n\r\nIn reading this class of fiction one is constrained to wonder what\r\nthese ingenious weavers of verbal tapestries would have done for plot\r\nand incident--such as they are--had the Seventh Commandment been\r\neliminated from the Tables of the Law. It is a never-failing\r\nwell-spring, a Fortunatus' pocket, a theme more rich in variations\r\nthan the Carnival of Venice; and it is amazing as well as instructive\r\nto the uninitiated to discover in how many original and striking ways\r\na wife may be unfaithful to her husband, and what startling and\r\ndramatic situations may be evolved out of the indiscretions of a too\r\nconfiding society-girl. But even the unmentionable has limits: the\r\nglacial smile of the nimblest ballet-dancer may lose somewhat of its\r\nfascination in the course of time; and in the overheated atmosphere of\r\nthe \"passionate\" novel may lurk the faintest intimations of a yawn.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, this multiform, many-worded element in current fiction is\r\nnot true passion at all. It is a theatrical presentation, often well\r\nset and brilliantly costumed; but too frequently you see the paint and\r\nhear the prompter calling forgotten cues from the wings. It is keen,\r\nwitty, cynical; but it is not real. It is daring, flippantly defiant,\r\nparoxysmal, and redundant in explosive adjectives; but it is not true\r\nto nature. It is as different from the genuine, living human emotion\r\nas the impetuous, fervid, and unpremeditated love-making of a youth is\r\nfrom the cold-blooded, carefully-rounded, and artificial gallantries\r\nof an aged suitor. Real passion is always poetic; there is a delicacy\r\nin its very vehemence, and if reprehensible from the moralist's point\r\nof view, it is never contemptible. Simulated passion, on the other\r\nhand, is always coarse and undignified--even when, as in the case with\r\nmany of these novels, expressed in graceful and smoothly-flowing\r\nsentences; often absurd and flavored with covert cynicism, as if it\r\ndespised itself and its object. Actual passion is almost entirely\r\nwanting in American fiction. The purer school of James and Howells\r\nmakes no pretence of it,--ignoring its existence in human nature, as\r\nif men and women were sentient shapes of ice,--and wisely, too; for\r\nthough the lack of it in romance is a fatal defect, it is better than\r\na poor imitation. Nathaniel Hawthorne, that isolated giant, drew from\r\nthe mysterious depths of his own great soul almost the only example of\r\ntrue passion in the literature of this country. \"The Scarlet Letter\"\r\ntowers aloft like the Olympian Jove among terra-cotta statuettes,\r\nperhaps the noblest work of fiction ever written. Here is passion,\r\nalmost awful in its intensity; suppressed, confined; struggling like a\r\nchained Titan, and at length breaking loose and overwhelming itself\r\nbeneath its own agony and despair--passion, beautiful with youth and\r\nhope, star-eyed, crowned with amaranth and clad in blood-red garments;\r\nled onward by his dark brothers, Sin and Death, in swift tumultuous\r\nflight, toward his unknown goal in the land of eternal shadows.\r\n\r\nCompared with this lordly poem, the erotic novel of the day, with its\r\nprurient platitudes, is as a satyr to Hyperion. Putting aside all\r\nquestion of the moral law in the relation of the sexes, is there not\r\nsomething foolishly undignified in these gasping, gurgling adjectives?\r\n\"Soul-scorching, flesh-melting flame of his eyes.\" \"Flammeous breath,\r\nsweeping her cheek, stirred her nature with a fierce, hungerous\r\nyearning.\" \"Ignescent passion.\" \"Gloating upon her hungerly.\" \"Gives\r\nher whole body a comprehensive voluptuous twist.\" \"All entangled in\r\nher sweet sinuous embrace.\" \"Languorously inviting.\"--But we pause\r\nupon the verge of the unquotable, daunted, stifled, in this mephitic\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nThis is called Realism!--this affected posturing, at which good-taste\r\nveils the face to hide the smile of contempt or the blush of common\r\ndecency--these ale-house stories transplanted to the drawing-room! Is\r\nthere--_is_ there nothing in that love, whose very name lingers upon\r\nthe lips like a song--that love which has inspired all poetry, all\r\nromance from the beginning of time; which has thrown down embattled\r\nwalls, taken strong cities, changed the boundaries of empires,\r\nmarshalled armed thousands upon memorable fields of blood; which in\r\nevery age has nerved men to great deeds and rewarded them for great\r\nsacrifices; the sunrise hope of youth, the evening meditation of the\r\nold, the spirit of home, the tender light which gleams about the\r\nhearth-stone, the glory of the world;--is there nothing, then, in this\r\nbut the blind impulse which draws animal to animal--which attracts the\r\ngroping inhabitants of the mire and the shapeless swimming lumps of\r\nthe sea? If it be so, then thrice sacred is that art which has power\r\nto throw a mist of glamour about this hideous reality, and make it\r\nseem beautiful to our eyes! Far better the divine lie than such truth!\r\nBut it is _not_ true: for real love, even though it pass the pale of\r\nthe law, and real passion, though it tempt to sin, have about them\r\nalways an inexpugnable dignity; and if condemned, it is not with\r\nlaughter or disgust.\r\n\r\nThe erotic in American fiction is a recent and exotic growth, not\r\nnative to the soil. It is therefore unhealthy and unwholesome. It is\r\nout of place in this cold northern air. In its own climate it is a\r\ngaudy flower; in this temperate zone it is a poisonous, spotted lily,\r\nrank of smell and blistering to the touch. The licentiousness of\r\nThéophile Gautier is elevated by the power of his transcendent genius\r\nto the plane of true art. In America it sinks into a denizen of the\r\ngutter.\r\n\r\nA remarkable feature of this noxious development is the prominent part\r\ntaken in it by women. It is somewhat startling to find upon the\r\ntitle-page of a work whose cold, deliberate immorality and cynical\r\ndisregard of all social decency have set the teeth on edge, the name\r\nof a woman as the author. We are so accustomed to associate modesty\r\nof demeanor, delicacy of thought and word, and purity of life with\r\nwoman, that a certain set of adjectives, expressive of virtue and\r\nmorality, have come to include the idea of femininity in their\r\nsignification. It is certainly surprising, if not repellent, to find\r\nwomen the most industrious laborers in the work of tearing down the\r\nstructure of honor and respect for their sex, which has so long been\r\nregarded as the basis of social existence. If this breaking of the\r\nholy images be but another manifestation of the revolt of women\r\nagainst the too narrow limits of ancient prejudice, it is only\r\nadditional proof that misguided revolution easily becomes mere\r\nanarchy. While the dispensation which would confine women to the\r\nnursery and kitchen, and exclude them from broader fields of action,\r\nis happily a dead letter, it is quite certain that no condition of\r\ncivilization, however liberal, will ever justify loose principles or\r\nlax manners, or what is almost as reprehensible and much more\r\ndespicable, the cynicism which sneers at virtue while it prudently\r\nkeeps its own skirts unsoiled. But it is probable that the women who\r\nwrite this kind of fiction are misled by vanity, rather than actuated\r\nby evil impulses. They imagine that in thus throwing off all restraint\r\nthey are giving evidence of originality of thought and force of\r\ncharacter; whereas they are, in fact, courting unworthy suspicion and\r\nwinning only that sort of applause which is thinly veiled contempt.\r\n\r\nIn America social licentiousness is not inherent as a national\r\ncharacteristic, nor inherited from a profligate ancestry. Whatever his\r\npractice may be, the ordinary American is theoretically moral. He\r\nrecognizes moral turpitude, at least to the extent of dreading\r\nexposure of his own backslidings. If he break the law, he nevertheless\r\ninsists upon the sanctity of the law. In a word, the social atmosphere\r\nis pure and wholesome, though perhaps a little chilly; and if anyone\r\nhappens to be the proprietor of a nuisance, he is very careful to keep\r\nit well concealed from his neighbors, and neutralize the evil odor\r\nwith lavish sprinklings of perfumery.\r\n\r\nWith us Licentiousness is not a gayly-clad reveller, a familiar figure\r\nat feasts and pleasure parties, taking his share in the festivities,\r\ndancing, laughing, and frisking as bravely as any. He is not a jovial\r\nBohemian, of too free life perhaps, but not half a bad fellow--a\r\ncareless, reckless, roaring blade. On the contrary, he is a dark,\r\nshadowy, saturnine personage: a loiterer in lonely places, a lover of\r\nthe night, skulking around corners and hiding his face in a ready\r\nmask. He dreads the law, for he knows that if detected his companions\r\nof yesterday will bear witness against him to-day, and lend their aid\r\nto set him in the stocks, to be jeered at by all the world. He is\r\nthin-blooded and pale; he shudders at the sound of his own footsteps,\r\nand shrinks from his own shadow. He knows no songs in praise of\r\nGillian and the wine-cup, and if he did he would never dare sing them.\r\nHe dresses in the seedy remains of a once respectable suit; he is an\r\noutcast, a beggar, a vagabond, down at the heels and owned by nobody.\r\nAltogether, he is as miserable and forlorn a wretch as one would care\r\nto see, and his _alter ego_ is hypocrisy.\r\n\r\nFor this reason the licentious in American literature is and must be\r\ncold, artificial, and repugnant. The erotic becomes mere bald\r\nimmorality, without grace, gayety, color, or warmth to lend it dignity\r\nor render it tolerable. In the opulent, fervid period of the\r\nRenaissance, art was born of passion and inspired by it to greatness.\r\nThe erotic was a legitimate element of all works of the imagination,\r\nbecause it was a part of the social life of the day, and because,\r\nbeing genuine, it could be made beautiful. When, after the Revolution\r\nin England and the spread of Calvinism on the Continent, the minds and\r\nmanners of men were brought under closer restraint, licentiousness in\r\nart began to be no longer natural and spontaneous, and therefore no\r\nlonger legitimate, until in the last century it degenerated into\r\nsimple indecency. When the erotic ceased to be quite as much a matter\r\nof course, in fiction or poetry, as hatred, jealousy, or revenge, and\r\nthe reader learned to pass it over with a frown or pick it out with a\r\nrelish, according to his natural disgust of or morbid craving for the\r\nimpure, it became a blemish. It was no longer real, but an indecent\r\nimitation. Compare \"Romeo and Juliet,\" that divine poem of passion,\r\nwith the abominations of Waters and Rochester, popular in their day,\r\nbut now happily forgotten, or even Wycherly, not yet quite forgotten,\r\nand mark how wide the difference between the true and the false, the\r\nnatural and the unnatural.\r\n\r\nTo-day, in America at least, the physical is subordinate to the\r\nspiritual. The mind is master, and the body in its bondage, if not\r\nenfeebled, has at least become trained to passive obedience. All\r\nimpulses are submitted to the severe scrutiny of reason. Categories of\r\nright and wrong, or perhaps the politic and the impolitic, are\r\nstrictly adhered to. Caution is largely in the ascendant. The world's\r\nopinion is an ever-present restraining element. All these are results,\r\nor at any rate concomitants of a loftier civilization. A society\r\nguided by moral and intellectual forces is unquestionably upon higher\r\nground than one dominated by the physical. The world is, moreover, a\r\nmore comfortable place to live in than it used to be when, on account\r\nof the color of the feather in one's hat, one must unsheathe and go at\r\nit, hammer and tongs, to save one's skin.\r\n\r\nPassion does still exist in the human heart, but it is restrained and\r\nmodified by the necessities and conditions of the social life of the\r\nday. To be a fit element of fiction it must be depicted in its\r\nnineteenth-century guise--in other words, decently. To be a truthful\r\npicture it can be depicted in no other way. To exhibit it posturing,\r\nwrithing, and gasping in mere hysteria is to lower it beneath the\r\nstandard of wholesome and worthy art. License without love, and\r\nimmorality without passion, are as unpardonable in a novel as they are\r\nin human nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Political Oratory of Emery A. Storrs_, by Isaac E. Adams (Belford,\r\nClarke & Co.).--The compiler of Mr. Storrs's political speeches begins\r\nhis introductory chapter with some questionable generalizations which\r\nare belittling and somewhat unjust to the large class of true orators\r\nto which his hero belongs. He says: \"Few examples of political oratory\r\nhave been embalmed in literature. Men, too, remembered for oratorical\r\npower are easily reckoned, and tower conspicuously along the shores of\r\ntime. There was once a Demosthenes, once a Cicero, once a Burke. The\r\ntime will come when, looking back upon the centuries of American\r\nhistory, it will be said there was, also, once a Webster and once a\r\nLincoln.\"\r\n\r\nWe must be permitted to observe that the line cannot be clearly drawn\r\nbetween political and other oratory. In a broad sense, all the great\r\norators known to history have been political orators, because they\r\ngained their fame chiefly in discussing the great and absorbing public\r\nquestions of their day.\r\n\r\nTo these belongs Emery A. Storrs. Let a few extracts from this volume\r\nof speeches suffice to show the style of his oratory. At Chicago, in\r\nthe darkest hours of our civil war, he said: \"I have no doubt but that\r\nthis, the most wicked rebellion that ever blackened the annals of\r\nhistory, will be ground to powder. I have no doubt but that our\r\nnational integrity will be preserved. I have no doubt but that the\r\nunion of these States will be restored, and that the nation will\r\nemerge from the fiery trial through which it has passed, brighter and\r\nbetter and stronger than it has ever been before. It would be\r\nimpossible, however, that a conflict mighty as that from which we are\r\nnow, I trust, emerging should not leave its deep and permanent impress\r\nupon our future national character. It will give tone to our politics,\r\nour literature, and our feelings as a people, for ages to come.\"\r\n\r\nAt Cleveland, in the campaign of 1880, he said: \"Have you seen any\r\ntrouble with the pillars of the government? The trouble was not with\r\nthe pillars--they did not rock; the trouble was with the gentlemen who\r\nwere looking at the pillars of the government. They were like the\r\ngentleman who had been attending a lecture on astronomy. Going home\r\nloaded with a great deal of Democratic logic, with a step weary and\r\nuncertain, with the earth revolving a great many times upon its axis,\r\nhe affectionately clasped a lamp-post and said, 'Old Galileo was right\r\nabout it: the world does move.'\"\r\n\r\nThe logic of Mr. Storrs's speeches on war topics, which were immensely\r\npopular, is embraced in the single sentence: \"I think there can be\r\nnothing more suicidal than to intrust into the hands of these men, who\r\nsought the destruction of our national life, the direction of our\r\nnational interests.\"\r\n\r\nHence the convenient 300-page volume under review will be valuable to\r\npolitical speakers and writers who want their party zeal warmed up by\r\nthe earnest appeals of an impassioned, conscientious, and clear-minded\r\norator. The diction of Mr. Storrs is admirable, his language is almost\r\nalways felicitous, and in his logic there is a happy blending of grace\r\nand force. If his range was not wide, he was always able to\r\nconcentrate learning and ability enough on any given occasion to show\r\na masterful oratorical power over immense masses of men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA STORM ASHORE.[5] BY JAMES H. CONNELLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nWHERE THE DEED WAS DONE.\r\n\r\nThree quarters of a century ago, when Sag Harbor was an important\r\nwhaling port, and before railroads were even dreamed of on that remote\r\npart of Long Island, there were dotted along the eastern shore only a\r\nfew quaint little villages, already old, with a small population\r\nscattered in their vicinity, consisting almost entirely of a hardy\r\nrace, who, though professedly cultivators of the soil, in reality drew\r\nmost of their subsistence from arduous and often perilous toil upon\r\nthe sea. Among the curiously inscribed tombstones in the graveyards,\r\nwhere even then six generations were lying, were not at all unfrequent\r\nthose that bore the legend \"killed by a whale.\" Of the younger men in\r\nthe community, there were few who did not aspire to go abroad as\r\nwhalers, and their elders, though settled agriculturists nominally, or\r\neven petty tradesmen, had generally \"been a-whaling,\" loved to spin\r\nyarns about their cruises, and were still more than semi-nautical in\r\nspeech, manners, and industries. They naturally spoke of \"the bow\" of\r\na horse, or his \"port-quarter,\" as occasion might require; belonged to\r\nshore whaling companies; fished for the New York market to a limited\r\nextent, and perhaps did some smuggling; as shore-living people, in\r\nthose days, generally seemed to think they had an inherent right to.\r\nIn their little \"sitting-rooms\" were many curious and interesting\r\nthings, brought from far distant lands, such as broad branches of fan\r\ncoral, stuffed birds of brilliant plumage, strange shells and sperm\r\nwhales' teeth adorned with queer rude pictures scratched upon them by\r\nsailors whose thoughts of loved ones at home had prompted them to such\r\nartistic endeavor.\r\n\r\nBetween the villages were long reaches of woodland, or perhaps it\r\nwould be more correct to say thicket--broken here and there, where the\r\nsandy soil seemed to give most promise, by tilled fields. Fierce\r\ngales, through the long hard winter months, dealt cruelly with the\r\nscrubby cedars and knotty little oaks in those woods, gnarling their\r\nboughs, twisting their trunks, and stunting their growth, so that not\r\nall the genial breath of spring, nor the ardent summer's sun could\r\nquite repair the damage wrought them in the season of ice and storm.\r\nBut the hardy trees stood close together, as if seeking support and\r\nconsolation from each other in their hours of trial, when they creaked\r\nand ground complaint to one another; so close that their interlaced\r\nfoliage kept always damp the leaf-strewn ground beneath, where the\r\nfragrant trailing arbutus bloomed in earliest spring, and the tangled\r\nwhortleberry bushes later bore their clusters of bluish-purple fruit.\r\nHere and there the dwarfed forest sloped gently down to broad expanses\r\nof salt meadow, where snipe and plover found their favorite feeding\r\ngrounds among the rank rushes and long grass, or the soft marshy\r\nslime, except when the full moon tides came rushing through the little\r\ninlets between the white round sand dunes on the beach and, whelming\r\nthe lowland, snatched brown-leaf trophies from the very edges of the\r\nwood. On the knolls between these meadows were favorite places for the\r\nlocation of the homes of the earlier settlers, among whom were the Van\r\nDeusts.\r\n\r\nThe Van Deust homestead was one of the oldest dwellings on that\r\nportion of the island, and those who at this time inhabited it were\r\nthe direct descendants of other Van Deusts, whose remote existence and\r\nremarkable longevity were alike attested by the quaintly graven\r\ntombstones in the ancient graveyard of the village, a mile away.\r\n\r\nIt was a rambling one-story house, built of small logs covered with\r\nboards now warped and rusty from age, but both roomy and comfortable\r\nas well as picturesque. Those by whom it was erected loved better the\r\nsea than the land, for they had not only sought out this, the most\r\ncommanding site they could obtain for its location, but had turned its\r\nback upon the forest and the lane, and reared its broad porch upon the\r\nside facing the ocean. Here, in the ample shade, the two old bachelor\r\nbrothers, its present occupants, inheriting as well the feeling as the\r\nproperty of their ancestors, loved to linger. The ceaseless roar of\r\nthe waves was in their ears a wild tumultuous music, and their eyes\r\nwere never weary of the ever-changing beauty and glory of the world of\r\nbillows, blushing with the dawn, laughing with the noon, and frowning\r\nbeneath storm and night. Three broad and rugged elm trees shaded the\r\nporch, and one gable of the house was rasped by the boughs of the\r\nnearest tree of a thickly grown and badly cared for little orchard.\r\nBats and swallows flitted undisturbed in the summer evenings to and\r\nfrom the low loft of the old homestead, through its various chinks and\r\nrefts; native song-birds build their nests and reared their young\r\nunder the eaves, and in the swinging branches of the venerable elms;\r\nbees buzzed among the thick honeysuckle, and clematis vines that\r\ntwined about the pillar of the porch, and threw their long sprays in\r\nflowery festoons between; and when the busy hum of those industrious\r\nlittle toilers ceased at nightfall, the crickets' cheery chirp, from\r\namong the rough stones of the old-fashioned fireplace within, took up\r\nthe refrain of insect melody. Neither insect, bird, nor beast feared\r\nthe two kindly old men who inhabited that home. One of the brothers\r\nloved all living things, and was at peace with all, and the other was\r\nlike unto him, with the sole exception that he liked not women, nor\r\nwas willing to be at peace with them. Yet he had never been married!\r\n\r\nPeter, the elder by a couple of years, was the woman hater, and to\r\nsuch an extent did he carry his antipathy toward the sex, that he\r\nwould tolerate no other female servant about the house than old black\r\nBetsy, who was the daughter of a couple of slaves his grandfather had\r\nowned, and who thoroughly considered herself one of the family, as\r\nindeed her indulgent masters regarded her. The three old people\r\noccupied the house alone. Brother Jacob once hinted to Peter that\r\nperhaps it might be as well to get a young woman to assist old Betsy\r\nin her work, and his so doing brought on what was more like a quarrel\r\nbetween him and Peter than anything that had disturbed the monotony of\r\ntheir uneventful lives up to that time. A compromise was finally\r\neffected, by virtue of which a neighbor was engaged to come over for a\r\ncouple of hours daily to do such chores about the house as the\r\nbrothers felt beyond their strength, and to bring his wife along on\r\nTuesdays to do the week's washing and scrubbing. But on Tuesdays Peter\r\nalways went a-fishing, regardless of the weather, and was gone all\r\nday, so avoiding sight of the neighbor's wife. Whatever the secret\r\ncause for his bitter and contemptuous aversion to women may have been,\r\nhe kept it to himself. That they were fair to look upon, he denied\r\nnot. \"But,\" said he, \"they are wrecker lights, and the truer and\r\nbetter a man is, the brighter they shine to lure him to the breakers.\r\nAnd look at yourself, Jacob,\" he would add, when his brother ventured\r\nto mildly expostulate against the vigor of his denunciations of the\r\nsex; whereupon Jacob would turn away with a sigh, and the discussion\r\nwould be at an end.\r\n\r\nBack of the house a narrow lane, bordered by a neglected garden and a\r\ncornfield beyond, led out to the distant highway. The Van Deust\r\nbrothers were not poor, as the humble style of their home might seem\r\nto indicate; indeed they had the reputation, in all the country\r\naround, of being wealthy, and were, at least, well off. The neglect\r\nand indifference of age in its owners was the sole cause that the\r\nsurroundings of the old homestead, which might easily have been made\r\ncharming, presented such a picture of disorder and decay.\r\n\r\nUp the little lane, at a very early hour one bright summer morning,\r\ntwo men might have been seen, driving in a light gig, approaching the\r\nVan Deust mansion. One of them was a stout, ruddy-faced gentleman, of\r\nfifty, or thereabouts, known to everybody in the county as Squire\r\nBodley. His companion, who held the reins, was a handsome young fellow\r\nof twenty-four or twenty-five years, rustic in personal appearance and\r\ngarb, with a good frank open countenance that bore a pleasing\r\nexpression of intelligence and good nature.\r\n\r\n\"Of course it's only a form, my going to be your security,\" said the\r\nolder man, as they jogged along, \"for the Van Deusts know you as well\r\nas I do, and knew your father, Dave Pawlett, before you, and a good\r\nman he was. But still, Lem, I don't know any young fellow in all the\r\ncountry round about that I'd take more pleasure in serving, even in a\r\nmatter of form, than you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir,\" replied the young man warmly, with a grateful flush\r\nupon his sun-burnt cheeks. \"It's very kind of you, I'm sure, and I\r\ncan't tell you how much I feel it so. You know I want the lease of\r\nthat lower farm, but you don't know how almightily much I want it; and\r\nnobody does but me and--one other person, perhaps.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aha!\" responded the Squire, with a chuckle, \"I can make a guess about\r\nwho the other person is. And some day you and that other person will\r\nbe coming to me for a little business in my line, I reckon,--a sort of\r\nmutual life lease, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, maybe so, Squire. I hope so,\" answered Lem, confusedly, and\r\nwith a little deeper flush, \"But here we are at the gate. Wait a\r\nmoment, while I jibe the bow wheels and make the horse fast.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he jumped lightly out of the vehicle, turned the horse a\r\nlittle to one side, so as to make the descent of his companion more\r\nconvenient, and, after hitching the reins to a fence-post, accompanied\r\nthe Squire to the door of the house. There was no sound, or sign, as\r\nyet, of any of the inmates of the old homestead being astir.\r\n\r\n\"Well, they must be late risers here,\" soliloquized the Squire, as Lem\r\nrapped and called at the door.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a few minutes, a voice answered indistinctly from\r\nwithin: \"Who's there? What d'ye want?\" And almost immediately after,\r\nthe shutters on the window of a little extension of the house, at the\r\nend farthest from the orchard, were pushed open, and the head of an\r\naged black woman appeared with the echoing query, \"Who dah? Wha' dy'e\r\nwan'?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's me--Squire Bodley,\" responded that gentleman, answering the\r\nfirst inquirer.\r\n\r\nPresently the door opened and Peter Van Deust appeared in it; a\r\nweazened, thin little man, with a fringe of gray hair surrounding a\r\nbig white bald place on the top of his head, with a well-formed nose\r\nand eyes still bright enough to suggest that he had been a\r\ngood-looking young fellow in his day; with lips that quivered, and\r\nlong lean fingers that trembled with the weakness of old age; but,\r\nwithal, a pleasant smile and a cheery ring, even yet, in his cracked\r\nold voice.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Squire!\" he exclaimed, as he threw open the door, \"I'm real glad\r\nto see you. And Lem! You, too? Well, this is a pleasant surprise-party\r\nfor us early in the morning!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not so very early, Peter,\" answered the Squire. \"It is almost\r\nseven o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that so? Well, I declare! I wonder why Jacob isn't up. He's mostly\r\nan early riser, and as he's the boy amongst us, why we old\r\nfolks--Betsy and me--rely on him to wake us up in the mornings. Old\r\npeople, you know, get back to being like babies again for wanting\r\ntheir good sleep. But Jacob has overslept himself this morning, sure.\r\nI'll soon roust him out, though.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he went to a closed door at one side of the central\r\nsitting-room, which was flanked by the separate apartments of the\r\nbrothers, and pounding upon it with his bony knuckles, called:\r\n\r\n\"Come, Jacob, bounce out, boy! You're late! It's breakfast time, and\r\nwe've got visitors. Get up!\"\r\n\r\nThere was no answering sound from within. He waited a moment, then\r\nknocked again, shouting: \"Hello, Jacob! Jake! I say, get up! What' the\r\nmatter with you?\"\r\n\r\nStill there was no response. The three men waiting, held their breath\r\nto listen, and a vague sense of uneasiness crept over them. The songs\r\nof the blue-birds, and the chirp of the martens; the humming of the\r\nbees; the stamping of the horse hitched to the gig, and the clatter\r\nold Betsy made in opening her door, were all sharply distinct in the\r\nquiet summer morning air; but from the closed room there was no sound\r\nwhatever. Peter tried the door, but it did not yield.\r\n\r\n\"He's locked his door!\" exclaimed the old man, with an intonation of\r\nsurprise in his voice.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe something has happened to him,\" suggested Lem.\r\n\r\n\"What could happen to him? He was all right last night; never better\r\nin his life. And he's younger than me. But it's queer he should have\r\nlocked his door. He don't mostly.\" He continued rapping and shouting\r\n\"Jacob, wake up!\" in a more and more anxious tone.\r\n\r\n\"The key isn't in the keyhole, I guess,\" he muttered half to himself,\r\nfumbling at the lock with a bit of stick he picked up from the floor,\r\n\"but,\" stooping down and trying to peer through, \"I can't see\r\nanything, because it's all dark inside.\"\r\n\r\n\"Haven't you some other key about the house that will fit the lock?\"\r\nasked the Squire.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Mine does, I guess. But I didn't think of it at first. I'll try\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nIt fitted: the bolt was thrown back, and the door pushed open. The\r\nsunshine darted in and fell, broad and clear, upon a still and ghastly\r\nthing that laid in the middle of the floor--the corpse of an old man,\r\nsurrounded by a pool of blood.\r\n\r\nPeter gave a wild cry of horror, and fell back senseless into the arms\r\nof Lem Pawlett, who was close behind him. They laid him on the old\r\nhair-cloth sofa in the sitting-room, called Betsy to attend to him,\r\nand then passed into the chamber he had opened.\r\n\r\nMurder had been done. Jacob Van Deust's skull had been beaten in by\r\nsome heavy instrument. One terrible crushing blow had mashed in his\r\nleft temple, and let out his little weak old life; but, as if for very\r\nlust of killing the assassin had struck again and again, and the skull\r\nwas fractured in several places. The old man, it appeared, had risen\r\nfrom his bed to meet his murderer, and had been struck down before he\r\ncould utter a cry of alarm. The window curtains were down, so that the\r\nroom was as yet only lighted from the door; but when those in front\r\nwere opened, and a flood of sunlight poured in, there were no\r\nevidences apparent that there had been any struggle between the slayer\r\nand his victim, nor were there at once visible any indications that\r\nrobbery, the only cause readily conceivable for the brutal murder of\r\nsuch an inoffensive old man, had been the purpose instigating the\r\ncrime. The contents of the bureau drawers were much tumbled and\r\ndisordered, but it was presumable that they were so usually, through\r\nthe careless habits of the occupant of the apartment. There were no\r\nmarks of blood upon anything they contained, but it was evident that\r\nthe murderer had made some attempt at least to wipe his crimsoned\r\nhands upon the old man's shirt after killing him, and that was\r\nprobably before he searched the bureau, if indeed he had troubled\r\nhimself to ransack it at all. On one pillow of the bed they found the\r\nmark of a bloody hand. Perhaps the assassin was in such haste for\r\nplunder that he groped where the old man's head had lain before\r\nthinking of his bloody hand. Beyond that nothing appeared to them to\r\nshow that robbery had been done.\r\n\r\nBut when Peter Van Deust had sufficiently recovered to be able to\r\nspeak coherently, he said that his brother habitually kept, somewhere\r\nin his room, a wallet containing something over three thousand\r\ndollars, and a bag of coin; how much he did not know. These were\r\nnowhere to be found.\r\n\r\nLem Pawlett was hastily dispatched by the Squire, soon after the\r\ndiscovery of the crime, to summon some near neighbors; and as he drove\r\nrapidly along the road, shouting to every person he saw--\"Jacob Van\r\nDeust has been murdered!\"--it was but a very little while before a\r\ndozen or more men were assembled at the scene of the crime. They were\r\nall innocent, simple-minded folks, who had never seen a murdered man\r\nbefore, had even been a little skeptical that such an awful thing as\r\nmurder was ever really done, except in the big cities where extreme\r\nwickedness was naturally to be expected, and were actually stunned by\r\nthe shock of finding themselves in the presence of the evidences of\r\nthe perpetration of such a deed. From them, of course, no aid in\r\nfinding a clue to the perpetrator of the crime, or divining its real\r\nmotive, could have been expected. Yet every man of them was wise in\r\nhis own conceit, and among them were furtively exchanged whispers of\r\nsuch hideous significance that the Squire, when they reached his ears,\r\nfelt himself compelled to take notice of and reply to them.\r\n\r\n\"The old men have been all the time quarrelling for two months past,\"\r\nsaid one to another.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied he who was addressed. \"I've heard 'em myself, cussing\r\neach other over the fortune that was left them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sam Folsom,\" added a third, \"told me that he'd heard that Peter had\r\nthreatened to knock Jake's head off more than once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! I've heard that myself,\" chimed in another. \"And I did hear that\r\nthey'd had a regular fight and Jake got the best of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's awful that two old men like them, on the edge of the grave, as\r\nyou may say, and brothers at that, should quarrel about money.\"\r\n\r\n\"And one for to go and kill the other.\"\r\n\r\nAt this point the Squire, who had overheard much of the preceding\r\nconversation, interposed: \"How do you know,\" he demanded abruptly,\r\nturning on the last speaker, \"who killed him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I dunno exactly, of course,\" whined the fellow, hesitatingly,\r\n\"but it looks mighty like it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! And that pimpled nose of yours, Rufe Stevens, looks mightily like\r\nyou were a hard drinker; but you are ready to take your Bible oath\r\nit's nothing but bad humors in your blood.\"\r\n\r\nThere were a few suppressed chuckles at the Squire's retort from those\r\nin the vicinity--for men will laugh even at the smallest things, and\r\nin the very presence of the King of Terrors--and Rufe moved away,\r\nmuttering indistinctly. But the Squire's interference and\r\nwell-intended reproof had only a momentary effect in diverting the\r\nattention of the neighbors from the evil bent of suspicion their minds\r\nhad taken; and they continued exchanging, and possibly augmenting, the\r\nrumors they had heard of differences between the Van Deust brothers,\r\nuntil the sentiment was general among them that Peter Van Deust should\r\nbe at once arrested for the murder of his brother.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nON INFORMATION AND BELIEF.\r\n\r\nThat the reader may be properly informed of certain antecedent events\r\nwhich, as will hereafter be seen, were intimately connected with, and\r\nindeed leading directly to the murder of Jacob Van Deust, it will be\r\nnecessary for us to make a brief retrogression in our narrative and to\r\nintroduce various other members of that little seaside community who\r\nbore their several important parts in the eventful drama of real life\r\nhere in progress of recital.\r\n\r\nNear the close of a day in earliest spring, when the sun, that had not\r\nyet sufficient power to melt the lingering patches of snow that still\r\nlaid here and there among the thickets and on northern slopes, was\r\nthrowing its last red rays upon the lowering, leaden-tinted masses of\r\nthe western sky, two young girls wandered, with their arms about each\r\nother's waists, in the shadows of the woods not far distant from the\r\nvillage of Easthampton. One of them, somewhat above the medium height\r\nof women, possessed a slender and graceful figure, and a face that,\r\nseen under the large, crimson-lined hood of the cloak with which her\r\nhead was covered, appeared almost pure Grecian in its regularity of\r\nfeature and delicacy of outline. Her complexion was pale, but the\r\nclear roseate flush of her cheeks, and the brilliancy of youth and\r\nhealth sparkling in her eyes, demonstrated sufficiently that that\r\npallidity was simply the added charm with which kindly nature at times\r\nenhances the loveliness of the most beautiful brunettes. The sentiment\r\nexpressed by her countenance was serious and earnest, but not sad, for\r\na faint smile, like the blossoming of some sweet hope, rested upon her\r\nsmall red lips. Her companion, who seemed to be of about the same\r\nage--not more than eighteen or nineteen years--was of a different\r\nmould; possibly less beautiful, but hardly less bewitching. She was\r\nsomewhat shorter of stature and rounder of form, with a face in which\r\nvivacity and determination were happily blended. Her laughing lips\r\nwere red and full, a merry mischievous light danced in her blue eyes,\r\nand her hood thrown back upon her neck, left bare a round head covered\r\nwith a wavy wealth of brown hair.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mary,\" said the brown-haired maid, bending forward and looking\r\nup archly in the face of her friend, \"let us drop this nonsense of\r\npretending to look for trailing arbutus, when you know, just as well\r\nas I do, that it will be a week, if not two, before there will be a\r\nsprig of it in bloom; and I know, just as well as you do, that you\r\ncalled me out for this walk to tell me something about Dorn Hackett,\r\nand for nothing else. Isn't that so, now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you sharp little thing. You have guessed rightly, as usual. I\r\nhave received another letter from Dorn.\"\r\n\r\n\"A letter from Dorn? The first for over a year, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, dear, it must seem almost like getting one from a stranger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whalers have so few chances to write home.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has been gone a great while, hasn't he?\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems so to me, I confess. And three years really is a long time,\r\nisn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me, yes. I wouldn't let Lem go away from me that way. Who knows\r\nbut what he might marry somebody else while he was gone? Have you\r\nnever been afraid that Dorn would?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, Ruth. Never. He loves me too well for that, I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you felt just as sure of that when you did not hear from him for\r\nnearly two years?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Mary, with a little hesitation, however: \"for I know\r\nthe girl whose lover goes a-whaling must have patience; and I have\r\nheard Uncle Thatcher tell a good deal about the countries to which the\r\nwhalers go, and I hardly think--\"\r\n\r\n\"That he would be likely to meet anybody there who would be able to\r\ncut you out. Well, there's some comfort in that reflection, anyway.\r\nBut the letter! What does he say for himself?\"\r\n\r\n\"That he is coming home, Ruth; coming home at last. He is on the way\r\nnow. A fast sailing packet-ship brought the letter on ahead, and he\r\nsupposed that he would arrive a couple of weeks after I received it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when he comes you'll get married?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--hope so,\" replied Mary, in a little lower tone and with tears\r\ngathering in her eyes. \"But you know we are poor; and besides, Uncle\r\nThatcher--\"\r\n\r\n\"That, for Uncle Thatcher,\" exclaimed little Ruth, snapping her\r\nfingers defiantly. \"What has he to say about whom you shall marry?\r\nThat is a matter which concerns nobody but you and Dorn.\"\r\n\r\n\"My mother, when she was dying in the big city, leaving me all alone,\r\nput me in his charge, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what of it? It would be as much as I'd do to let my father and\r\nmother interfere with my marrying any nice young man I liked, and I\r\ndon't believe parents can transfer that right--if it is a right--to\r\nanybody. Uncle Thatcher, indeed!\" she ejaculated scornfully, with a\r\ntoss of her little resolute round head. \"What does he want you to do,\r\nanyway? To live and die an old maid, to please him?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I have been ashamed to tell anybody heretofore--even you,\r\nRuth--but he wants me to marry Cousin Silas.\"\r\n\r\n\"That ugly, good-for-nothing cub of his?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; Silas asked me to once, and when I refused him, said that I was\r\nonly a pauper living on his father's charity, and threatened to tell\r\nsuch stories about me that nobody else would have me. He hurt and\r\nfrightened me terribly, and Dorn found me in the woods crying about\r\nit. In the fullness of my heart I told him all. I couldn't keep it to\r\nmyself when he asked me why I cried. And do you know what he did? He\r\nwent right off and gave Silas such an awful pounding that he was laid\r\nup for two weeks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good! I like Dorn Hackett better than I ever did before. That's just\r\nwhat I should expect of Lem in such a case.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was the time Silas was reported to be so sick, just before Dorn\r\nwent away. He never dared to talk about me as he said he would, I\r\nguess, but as soon as he got well went right off to New York. Uncle\r\nThatcher blamed Dorn for hurting Silas, and has hated the thought of\r\nhim ever since. And oh, Ruth! you don't know what I've had to suffer\r\nfrom Aunt Thatcher!\"\r\n\r\n\"Now you just take my advice and put your back right up at her; and as\r\nsoon as Dorn comes home, you two go right off and get married, and if\r\nUncle Thatcher tries to interfere, have Dorn pound him, too--worse\r\nthan he did Silas.\"\r\n\r\nMary smiled through her tears and replied: \"Dorn says he has done well\r\nand talks about buying a share in a coasting schooner--and a\r\nhouse--and--furniture--and I think he said something about getting\r\nmarried right away.\"\r\n\r\nIn sympathetic exuberance of joy the two girls embraced and kissed\r\neach other, Ruth exclaiming:\r\n\r\n\"And we'll get married on the same day, won't we? And in spite of\r\nUncle Thatcher, or anybody else, Mary Wallace will be Mrs. Dorman\r\nHackett, and Ruth Lenox will be Mrs. Lemuel Pawlett. But I wish Lem's\r\nname didn't rhyme with 'pullet' and 'gullet.'\"\r\n\r\nThe two charming young friends were so busy with their theme that not\r\nuntil they were close before him, in the little bridle path through\r\nwhich they wandered, did they notice the presence of a third person: a\r\nsmoothly-shaven, little, elderly gentleman, primly dressed in black\r\nand wearing a band of crape upon his tall silk hat. He was upon\r\nhorseback, sitting silent and motionless. He had seen the girls slowly\r\nstrolling toward him, waited until they almost collided with his\r\nhorse's nose and had executed a little concerted scream of surprise,\r\nand then addressed them in a slow, measured and precise manner,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n\"I am endeavoring to find the residence, or residences, of two persons\r\nknown as Peter and Jacob Van Deust, supposed to be brothers, who,\r\naccording to my present information and belief, reside somewhere in\r\nthis vicinity. Can either of you young ladies direct me definitely\r\nupon my way, and if able, will you be so kind as to do so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Follow the path you are on,\" answered Ruth, \"until you enter the main\r\nroad; turn to your right about a quarter of a mile, then go up a lane\r\nthat you will see on your left--the first that has an elm tree on each\r\nside of its entrance--and it will lead you straight up to the Van\r\nDeust homestead.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very much obliged to you for your apparent courtesy and the\r\nseeming accuracy of the details of your information,\" responded the\r\nlittle gentleman, with grave deliberation, bending almost to the\r\nhorse's mane as he spoke. Then straightening himself, and shaking the\r\nreins, he urged his steed into a gentle trot and soon disappeared in\r\nthe gathering evening shades at a bend of the path.\r\n\r\n\"'Supposed to be brothers'--indeed!\" exclaimed Ruth, when he was out\r\nof sight. \"I'm sure their faces will afford him sufficient\r\n'information and belief' on that score when he sees them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nA GOLDEN RAIN.\r\n\r\nThe Van Deust brothers sat smoking their pipes in the twilight on the\r\nwide porch of the old homestead overlooking the sea.\r\n\r\n\"I met Thatcher to-day when I was over at the village,\" said the\r\nyounger brother, Jacob, \"and he wanted to put the ten acre lot in corn\r\non shares.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" responded Peter, \"I suppose he might as well have it as\r\nanybody. Somebody will have to work it. We are getting too old, Jacob,\r\nfor ploughing and such-like hard toil ourselves, and a third will be\r\nall we'll want. What did you tell him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't give him any definite answer. I wish somebody else would\r\noffer to take the lot. I don't like that Thatcher.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a hard, severe-looking old fellow, and I'm sure he treats that\r\npretty niece of his badly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! He does, eh? And now, Jacob, what the mischief is that to you?\r\nAnd what has it to do with his putting the ten-acre lot in corn on\r\nshares?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've seen her crying.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! Girls are always crying. They like it. They do it for practice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Peter, you'd kick a boy for throwing stones at a wild bird, wouldn't\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's another matter. Birds are birds, and they're God's creatures;\r\nbut women are the devil's creatures, and you'll never see Peter Van\r\nDeust trouble himself to lift his foot to a boy that throws stones at\r\nthem. If the girl don't like the treatment her uncle gives her, I\r\nsuppose she can find some fellow fool enough to marry her. 'Most any\r\nof 'em can do that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Peter, you shouldn't talk that way. A poor girl has her feelings\r\nabout marrying where her liking goes, just as much as a man has.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yah!\" snarled Peter, contemptuously, vigorously puffing his pipe, and\r\nfor some minutes both men were silent. The younger of the two sank\r\ninto a reverie, and awoke from it with a start, when his brother\r\nresumed the conversation, saying:\r\n\r\n\"I tell you what it is, Jacob. You were spooney on Mary Wallace's\r\nmother forty years ago, and I'm blessed if I think you have got over\r\nit yet. She threw you overboard then, not for a better looking\r\nman--for you were a fine, trim, sailor-built young fellow in those\r\ndays--but for a richer one. She thought--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, Peter! No, no! Don't say that! Don't say that! She didn't\r\nwant to marry Wallace. I know she didn't. But her father and mother\r\ncompelled her to it. She loved me best, I know she did. But you are\r\nright in saying I haven't got over it, Peter. I never shall. I'll love\r\nher just the same still, if I meet her in heaven. And when I see\r\nMary's sweet young face, the love that is in my heart for her mother's\r\nmemory cries out like a voice from the grave of all my hopes and joys,\r\nand I can hardly keep from taking poor Lottie's child in my arms and\r\nweeping over her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which, if you were to do, she would think you were crazy, and right\r\nshe would be,\" commented Peter, snarlingly.\r\n\r\n\"Hello!\" sounded shortly, in a sharp wiry voice, from the little lane\r\nat the back of the house.\r\n\r\nPeter, rising from his bench and going to the end of the porch,\r\nreplied with a sailor-like \"Aye, aye, sir,\" to the hail of the\r\nstranger, who was none other than the little elderly gentleman already\r\nencountered by Ruth and Mary in the woods. Without dismounting, the\r\nvisitor asked, in a slow and cautious manner,\r\n\r\n\"Am I justified in presuming that I am upon the premises of the\r\nparties known as Peter and Jacob Van Deust?\"\r\n\r\n\"This is where we live,\" replied Peter, a little puzzled by the\r\nstranger's manner.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, sir, but your reply is not an answer to my question. Am I\r\nto understand that you are one of the said parties?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm Peter, and this is Jacob,\" responded the elder brother, pointing\r\nwith the stem of his pipe at the younger. \"But come alongside before\r\nyou get off any more of that lingo.\"\r\n\r\nMethodically and carefully the rider dismounted, fastened his nag to\r\nthe fence, and pushing open the little gate, stepped upon the low\r\nporch-floor, where, after an elaborate bow to each of the brothers\r\nseparately, he continued:\r\n\r\n\"Assuming your affirmation to be correct and capable of substantiation\r\nby documentary evidence, and believing that you are, as you represent\r\nyourselves--or, rather, as one of you has represented--Peter and Jacob\r\nVan Deust, permit me, gentlemen, to have the pleasure of offering you\r\nmy congratulations.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he raised his tall hat with old-time courtesy, repeated his\r\nbows to the brothers severally, and replaced his beaver with such\r\nexactitude that not a hair of his nicely-brushed wig was disarranged.\r\n\r\n\"Congratulations upon what? Upon being Peter and Jacob Van Deust?\"\r\ndemanded Peter, who began to look upon his visitor as a probably\r\nharmless lunatic.\r\n\r\n\"Naturally, sir. For reasons which you shall presently apprehend. Have\r\nyou, or have you had, sir, to your knowledge, an uncle named Dietrich\r\nVan Deust?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. It was Uncle Dietrich who went away to the Indies when we were\r\nboys, wasn't it, Peter?\" said the younger brother.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and settled somewhere there; I forget where. Batavia, I think,\r\nwas the name of the place; but I ain't sure, for it is an age since I\r\nheard from him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your remembrance is correct, nevertheless, sir,\" responded the\r\nstranger. \"It was in Batavia that he took up his residence, and in\r\nBatavia that he died, at an advanced age, an old bachelor, possessed\r\nof large wealth, as I have been given to understand; and I offer my\r\ncongratulations to you, gentlemen, for the reason that you are his\r\nfortunate heirs to the extent of one hundred thousand dollars.\"\r\n\r\nThe mere mention of that stupendous sum, as it seemed to them, fairly,\r\nstunned the two simple-minded old men who received this intelligence.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Peter! It can't be there's so much money,\" gasped Jacob.\r\n\r\n\"Let me turn it over in my mind. Take a seat, sir,\" said Peter,\r\npushing forward a stool for the visitor, reseating himself on his\r\nbench and slowly rubbing his forehead. Jacob went out to put away the\r\nlittle gentleman's horse, and while he was gone Peter relighted his\r\npipe and smoked in silence. When the younger brother returned, the\r\nvisitor resumed the conversation.\r\n\r\n\"My name,\" said he, \"is Pelatiah Holden, and my profession that of\r\ncounsellor-at-law. Here is my card,\" presenting one to each of the Van\r\nDeusts, and then continuing: \"Four months and fourteen days since, I\r\nreceived from the firm of Van Gulden & Dropp, of Amsterdam, Holland,\r\ninformation to the effect that a client of theirs named William Van\r\nDeust was joint heir in the estate of Dietrich Van Deust, deceased, of\r\nBatavia; and they desired me, in order to facilitate the partition of\r\nthe estate, to discover two other heirs, nephews of the deceased\r\nDietrich Van Deust, named respectively Peter and Jacob Van Deust, sons\r\nof Jan Van Deust.\r\n\r\n\"That was father's name,\" interpolated Jacob in an undertone.\r\n\r\n\"As I have been already informed, sir, and do not doubt your ability\r\nto establish by legal proof,\" replied Mr. Holden, bowing gravely to\r\nhim and going on with his narration. \"Since that time, until three\r\nweeks ago, I have been seeking you, and it has only been during four\r\ndays past that I have been satisfied that your claim to be the sons of\r\nJan Van Deust, and nephews of Dietrich--and consequently inheritors\r\nunder the will of the latter--could be legally established. Hence the\r\napparent delay. But you will perceive, gentlemen, from my explanation,\r\nthat I have notified you of the gratifying fact of the bequest, at the\r\nearliest practicable and proper moment.\"\r\n\r\nPeter nodded silently, not having yet completed, seemingly, the\r\nserious task of \"turning it over in his mind.\" But Jacob effusively\r\nstammered:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we were not in any hurry, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThe lawyer resumed, speaking with the deliberate precision of one who\r\nreads an indictment: \"Under the terms of the will, you are to enjoy\r\nthis inheritance jointly while you both live, and expend it all, if\r\nyou please, but by mutual consent. And should any of it remain at the\r\ntime of the demise of either of you, it must descend to the survivor,\r\nuntrammelled by any right of bequest on the part of the first\r\ndecedent. And no contract, bargain, agreement, stipulation, or\r\nunderstanding whatever between you, concerning its disposal shall be\r\nmade, by which the one surviving may be bound, or influenced in its\r\nadministration; and to the fact that he is in no wise so bound, the\r\nsurvivor must make oath when entering into sole possession, else the\r\nsum so remaining must lapse to residuary legatees belonging to a\r\nremote branch of your family in Holland. What your uncle's intentions\r\nmay have been in framing his will in this unusual manner, I do not\r\npretend to say; nor is it, indeed, my province to inquire; but the\r\nfacts are--as I know from an attested copy of the will in my\r\npossession--as I have had the honor of presenting them to you. And\r\nnow, gentlemen, permit me to renew my congratulations and express the\r\nhope that you may long be joint possessors of this handsome\r\ninheritance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nTRUE LOVE.\r\n\r\n    \"The winds are fair, the sky is bright,\r\n    The sails are drawing free,\r\n    And loud I sing, my heart is light,\r\n    My loves returns to me.\r\n\r\n          To the no'nothe east and the sou'sou' west,\r\n          And every other way,\r\n          He's sailed from the girl that loved him best,\r\n          But he comes back to-day.\r\n\r\n                \"Land ho!\" \"Land ho!\"\r\n                \"Land on the starboard bow!\"\r\n                \"Land ho!\" \"Land ho!\"\r\n                He's in the offing now.\r\n\r\n    The nights were dark, the days were drear,\r\n    When he was on the deep,\r\n    Now night is gone, the day is clear,\r\n    And I no more shall weep.\r\n\r\n          To the no'nothe east and the sou'sou' west,\r\n          And every other way,\r\n          He's sailed from the girl that loves him best,\r\n          But he comes back to-day.\r\n\r\n                \"Land ho!\" \"Land ho!\"\r\n                \"Land on the starboard bow!\"\r\n                \"Land ho!\" \"Land ho!\"\r\n                He's in the offing now.\"\r\n\r\nSo sung pretty Mary Wallace, as, sitting at the foot of a little tree,\r\nher favorite haunt and old time trysting-place in the woods, she\r\nabandoned herself to happy anticipations of her lover's return. Each\r\nhour might bring him now. Her bonnet was thrown aside and her black\r\ncurls rippled down loosely over her shoulders. Her head was thrown\r\nback into the palms of her hands interlocked behind it, and her\r\nbeautiful face, thus upraised, beamed with innocent gladness. And she\r\nsang, as the birds sing, from sheer happiness.\r\n\r\n\"He's in the offing now,\" sang a full, rich, manly voice, joining hers\r\nin the last line of her song, and with a little inarticulate cry of\r\nsurprise and joy she sprang to her feet, to be the next moment\r\nenfolded in the strong arms of her sailor lover, back from the sea.\r\n\r\nDorn Hackett was a fine-looking young fellow, of a size worthy of a\r\nwoman's liking, with a handsome, expressive face, hazel eyes, brown\r\nhair, broad and well-balanced head, square shoulders, deep chest, and\r\nsuch powerful arms as might have served for the model of a Hercules.\r\n\r\n\"Why, darling, you are crying!\" he exclaimed, as with gentle force he\r\nraised her face from his breast and looked into her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Dorn, they are happy tears. Do you not know that a woman weeps\r\nwhen her heart is full, just because it _is_ full, whether it be\r\nfilled with joy or sorrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you shall never cry for sorrow again, if I can prevent it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you will never again leave me for so long a time. Oh, Dorn, it\r\nseemed as if you never would come back; and my heart ached so with\r\nlonging for you. You don't know how unhappy I have been sometimes,\r\nwhile you were away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? Has that rascal Silas been making you any more trouble?\"\r\ndemanded the young man, his eyes blazing, and his hands involuntarily\r\nclenching in sudden anger.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, Dorn. He went away very soon after you did, and has not\r\nreturned since.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then that uncle of yours, I suppose--\"\r\n\r\n\"He has been no worse than before; rather better, perhaps as Silas was\r\nnot here to be urged upon me and you were gone--none but I knew\r\nwhere--and, as he no doubt hoped, never to come back. But I begin to\r\nthink, sir, that you didn't love me at all as much as you professed,\r\nor you would have felt something of the loneliness that I suffered and\r\nunderstand better why I was unhappy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Darling, I--\"\r\n\r\n\"What a foolish girl I have been! Crying my eyes out for one who was\r\nno doubt very merry without me and well contented.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! You only say that to make me tell you again how much I love you,\r\nlittle Mollie. I've felt lonely enough, sometimes, it is true; but\r\nnever enough to cry about it, I must confess; and I rather think the\r\nfellow is soft-headed as well as soft-hearted who pipes his eye and\r\ngets down in the mouth when he can say to himself that every day that\r\npasses, and every new exertion he makes, brings him nearer to the girl\r\nhe loves. Why, instead of getting blue with thoughts of my far-away\r\nlittle Mollie, they gave me courage, and strength, and happiness. They\r\nwarmed me as I lay along the yard furling sail in the icy gale; they\r\nmade short the long hours of the night when I took my trick at the\r\nwheel; they nerved my arm when I struck for the life of a whale.\"\r\n\r\n\"I find myself beginning to believe again that you really did love\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Love you? Why, I couldn't live without loving you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you never thought that while you were so long away I might learn\r\nto love somebody else?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Never even dreamed of such a thing,\" he replied simply.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Now I know you loved me, for only perfect love, knowing but its\r\nown fullness and truth, is so trustful. And you were right, dear Dorn.\r\nI could love no one but you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, my pet,\" continued Dorn, after the natural ceremonial of due\r\nrecognition of such a sweet avowal--the form and manner of which\r\nyouthful readers may readily figure to themselves, and older ones\r\nperhaps find suggested by memory--\"we'll not have much longer to wait\r\nnow. Our cruise was a good one, and when the shares are figured up and\r\npaid off, I'll have a handsome little sum coming to me. Then an owner\r\nin New Haven, Mr. Merriwether, wants me to take immediate command of a\r\nschooner trading between that port and the West Indies, and has\r\noffered me such a pretty share of the profits that I have agreed to\r\nmake a few trips for him. Then I shall have enough to build a cage for\r\nmy bird, and to buy, not simply a share in a schooner, but a whole\r\nschooner--all by myself, I hope, and we will be made folks for life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! You're going away again, Dorn?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but only for short voyages of a month or so at a time, and I'll\r\nbe over to see my little Mollie every time I'm in home port; and in\r\nthe fall, if not before, we'll be married. No more long voyages for\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm so glad to hear you say that, dear; and I can wait patiently,\r\neven happily, when I may see you sometimes.\" And, possibly for\r\nhappiness still, the girl began crying softly again.\r\n\r\n\"Come, come, little Mollie,\" said her sailor lover, consoling her with\r\na kiss, \"there's no occasion to rig the pumps in such fair weather as\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\nMary smiled through her tears, and dried her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" he continued, \"let me hear your voice, darling. Tell me\r\nsomething.\"\r\n\r\n\"What shall I tell you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me again if you still love me.\"\r\n\r\nFor answer she put her arm around his neck, drew his face down to\r\nhers, and kissed him. What words could have been so complete and\r\neloquent an assurance as that chaste and tender caress?\r\n\r\n\"My own dear little wife,\" he exclaimed, embracing her passionately.\r\n\r\n\"Don't call me 'wife' until I am one,\" she said, with assumed\r\nearnestness, \"for I'm told it's unlucky.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, maybe it may be,\" he answered slowly and doubtingly. \"There's\r\nno denying that there is something in luck. Every sailorman knows\r\nthere are unlucky things, such as sailing on a Friday, and drowning a\r\ncat, and lots more, and that may be so. Well, I won't take any chances\r\non it. But I've thought of you for eleven hundred days and nights as\r\nmy little wife, and the words sprang naturally to my lips. Still I'll\r\ntry not to call you so any more until we are married.\"\r\n\r\n\"And to prevent any harm from your indiscretion I suppose I must use\r\nthe counter-charm.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that is--?\"\r\n\r\n\"To call you,\" and winding her arms again about his neck she whispered\r\nin his ear, \"my big husband.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then, of course, there were more suitable ceremonials, endearments\r\nand caresses, and mutual protestations of undying affection, such as\r\nyoung people so circumstanced have always made, make yet, and\r\ndoubtless will make to the end of time.\r\n\r\nHow very short the time seemed to the lovers from the moment of their\r\nmeeting until by a glance at the stars, the true sailor's clock, Dorn\r\nsaw that it was near the hour for him to leave Elysium and hasten to\r\njoin a shipmate, who was waiting for him in a light sail-boat off\r\nNapeague Inlet, to take him back to New London and the stern realities\r\nof life. And so, after a final settlement as to the probable time of\r\nhis return from his first West Indian voyage; and a little more\r\nprevisionary talk about the happiness of which they were so well\r\nassured the enjoyment in the coming autumn; and consequently more\r\nlove-making and caressing, all of which could have no interest for\r\nanybody but themselves, the lovers parted.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nTHE POISON OF GOLD.\r\n\r\nThere was no difficulty whatever in establishing the identity of the\r\nVan Deust brothers, and no obstacles were interposed to prevent their\r\nentering into possession of their fortune as speedily as the forms of\r\nlaw and the time requisite for communication with Holland would\r\npermit; for in those days it had not yet become a branch of the legal\r\nbusiness to stir up vexatious will contests, based upon the fictitious\r\nclaims of presumptive heirs, in order that lawyers might fleece the\r\nreal inheritors. Even before the money arrived from Holland Peter\r\nwanted a few thousand dollars of it in the house as a tangible\r\nevidence of the reality of their wealth; and Mr. Holden very\r\ncheerfully humored his whim by making him an advance of the required\r\namount. The old man had no idea of investing the money, or buying\r\nanything with it; but he loved to run his fingers through the\r\nglittering coins from time to time and listen to the mellifluous music\r\nof their chinking; to count, and recount, and pile the yellow discs,\r\nand think what he could do with them if he had a mind to. The unhappy\r\nfact was that this sudden acquisition of wealth had developed a really\r\nmiserly disposition in the elder brother. As is very common,\r\nespecially among those who only acquire large fortunes late in life,\r\npossession begat in him a longing to possess. He even felt it an\r\ninjury that he had been all those years without that money, the\r\nexistence even of which he had not known, and for which, now that he\r\nclutched it, he really had not the slightest use. He had never been\r\none at whom the tongue of scandal might have wagged the reproach of\r\nprodigality, even in his youth; but his jealously careful economy was\r\ngreater now than it had ever before been.\r\n\r\nJacob proposed one day that they should purchase two black broadcloth\r\nsuits and crape-bound hats, to be worn as mourning for Uncle Dietrich;\r\nbut was completely discomfited by the look of pained surprise with\r\nwhich Peter regarded him, and the tone in which he replied:\r\n\r\n\"Now, Jacob, would you go to making ducks and drakes of our little\r\nmoney in that way, and at your time of life?\"\r\n\r\nNo, Jacob resigned his idea of a tribute to Uncle Dietrich's memory,\r\nand penitently declared he really had no notion of becoming a\r\nspendthrift; and thereafter he uncomplainingly and unquestioningly\r\nleft his elder brother to the sole administration of their joint\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\nWhen the bulk of their inheritance arrived and was placed in the hands\r\nof Mr. Holden for investment on bond and mortgage in New York, that it\r\nmight yield more dollars to covetous Peter's longings, then the old\r\nman's troubles indeed began. When he heard of a fire, he trembled to\r\nthink that perhaps it was property mortgaged to the Van Deust Fund\r\nthat was burned. When he read of a bankruptcy he shuddered for fear\r\nthat the delinquent might have been indebted to the Van Deust Fund.\r\nWhen he had no bad news, then his anxiety was even greater, for at\r\ntimes he was capable of thinking it possible that worthy little Mr.\r\nHolden might have run away with the Van Deust Fund bodily. All this\r\nmade him a very uneasy and unhappy old man. Jacob's kinder and more\r\ntrustful nature gave place to none of those anxieties, and Peter\r\nresented his seeming indifference to the Van Deust Fund.\r\n\r\n\"Jacob,\" said he, one day, \"we might live to see the Fund doubled.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Peter, if it were, what more good would it do us?\"\r\n\r\nThe elder brother felt almost sick with disgust at that unambitious\r\nreply, and said that he felt so.\r\n\r\nThus it was that Peter's temper, never a remarkably sweet one, became\r\nso sour that meek old Jacob grew to look upon him with actual dread\r\nand would shun him, or sit looking askance and timidly at him, when\r\nthey smoked together on the porch in the evenings, in the habit but\r\nnot the content of former days. And, seeing this, a new suspicion\r\nentered Peter's soul to plague him.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose,\" said he, one day, with a grim smile, \"that you think\r\nbecause I'm the oldest, I'll die first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, now, Peter, my dear Peter! I assure you I never had such a\r\nthought,\" protested horrified Jacob.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's only natural you should. I don't blame you. But I'm good for\r\na good many years yet, Jacob; a good many years yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I trust and fervently hope and pray, brother Peter, that you may be\r\ngood for very many years to come.\" And the tender-hearted old man's\r\nvoice trembled, and his eyes were moist as he spoke. \"Why,\" said he,\r\n\"to think of your dying, Peter, gives me a--a--a--\"\r\n\r\n\"An idea, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, Peter, not at all that. No. A cold shudder, I meant; but you\r\nstartled me so I couldn't think of the word. After all the many years\r\nwe have lived together, all by ourselves, with no other companions and\r\nhardly any other friends than each other! Why, Peter, if I were to\r\nlose you, I'd want to die myself, right off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph. Not you. I know what you'd want to do a heap more. And I don't\r\nblame you. Oh, no. It's natural for you. But I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Know what?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know what you'd do with the Fund if I was out of the way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you know much more, Peter, than I should know, even if I had it\r\nin my hands, to do what I pleased with this blessed minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you'd be a special Providence for the women. That's what you'd\r\nbe, you soft old noodle. You'd give it away to the young ones that\r\nwanted to marry, like Mary Wallace; to the middle-aged ones who were\r\nsorry they had married, like Mrs. Richards. Oh, you don't think I've\r\nnoticed and understood your hinting 'how poor she was,' and 'how hard\r\nshe must find it to get along with her five small children and\r\ndeserted by her worthless husband;' and I've no doubt, if the truth\r\nwere known, he had some good reasons for leaving her. And you'd give\r\nit to the old ones, just because they were old women. You'd give a lot\r\nof it to Mary Wallace, for her mother's sake, I've no doubt. Oh, yes.\r\nBeautiful ideas you'd have, and fine things you'd do with the Fund if\r\nI was out of the road.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I should do all that you have said, brother, I think the Fund\r\nwould be doing a great deal more good than it does now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aha! There! You admit it! I knew it! But you needn't think you'll\r\never get the chance. I'll live to bury you yet.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time he had worked himself up into a veritable passion; his\r\nlean old fingers trembled with the agitation of his wrath, and his\r\nperverted senses were deaf and blind to the loving kindness of Jacob's\r\nmeek and gentle response, \"And I hope, Peter, that you may.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't. You're a hypocrite,\" he retorted, furiously. Jacob looked\r\nat him sadly, shook his head, and after lighting his pipe in silence,\r\nstrolled away for his evening smoke to the woods, where he was wont to\r\nretire when Peter made the house too warm for him.\r\n\r\nBut the crushed worm, proverbially at least, eventually turns; and one\r\nday the younger brother, badgered beyond endurance by those\r\noft-repeated taunts and reproaches, which were always accompanied by\r\ncruel raspings of the old wound in his heart, faced his tormentor and\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, \"take it by and large, and I think if I should do all\r\nthat you have said with the money I'd make a better use of it than\r\nyou'd be likely to.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you know about what I'd do with it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No more than you know what I would; but I've got just as good a right\r\nto guess as you have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what do you 'guess'?\" retorted Peter, with a sneering wicked\r\ngrin.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I imagine that as long as you lived you would hang on to every\r\npenny of it, like an old miser as you are, and when Death loosed the\r\ngreedy clutch of your avaricious fingers from it, it would be\r\ndiscovered that you had left it all to found a home for worn-out,\r\ndried-up, useless, ill-natured old animals such as we are, creatures\r\nwho have outlived all love but that of self, and deserve no other; men\r\nwho, like you, have no without a blush for what they are, and a sigh\r\nfor what they might have been.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jacob, you're a chuckle-headed ass.\"\r\n\r\n\"Peter, you're a soulless old curmudgeon, and a brute.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you talk to me like that. For two cents I'd knock your head\r\noff.\"\r\n\r\n\"For a money consideration I've no doubt you'd try it; but I'll bet\r\nyou a thousand dollars you can't knock one side of it off.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll bet a thousand dollars! I'd like to know where you'd get 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right in the house. Half the money that's there belongs to me. It all\r\nbelongs to me just as much as to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, indeed! And you'd like to knock me in the head and get possession\r\nof it, wouldn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. But I'd like to jam some sense into your thick skull, and bleed\r\nout some of the meanness and selfishness that fills your heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Faw de Lo'd's sake. Is you boys a qwa'lin'?\" demanded old black\r\nBetsy, coming up on the porch; and they slunk away ashamed before her.\r\n\r\nBut when Jacob had once \"read the Declaration of Independence,\" as he\r\nstyled his self-assertion against Peter's domineering disposition, he\r\nsoon fell into the habit of repeating the precedent, and as Peter did\r\nnot willingly or easily relinquish his sovereignty--the prerogative of\r\nseniority in his opinion--they had many a wordy wrangle, and not\r\ninfrequently uttered to each other such threats as might well have\r\nseemed ominous if overheard by strangers. And they were overheard, and\r\ntheir quarrels were repeated and magnified in circulation from mouth\r\nto mouth; so that it was not long before it became matter of common\r\nnotoriety in the community that the two old men had actually had\r\nknock-down fights; and once, when Peter was laid up with the\r\nrheumatism, and Jacob was nursing him most tenderly and\r\nassiduously--notwithstanding the invalid's temper was just then even\r\nworse than usual--it was popularly believed that the elder brother had\r\nbeen almost killed by the younger in a bloody combat, and there were\r\nthose who even talked of \"speaking to the squire about it.\" But the\r\nbrothers never did come to blows, and the only immediate result of\r\ntheir quarrels was a formal division between them of the money on hand\r\nin the house, after which it was allowed to lie in two parts, as\r\nuseless as it before was in one. Jacob indeed had some idea of giving\r\nhis share to Mary Wallace, but could not exactly make up his mind upon\r\nwhat pretence or with what excuse to offer it, and feared to offend\r\nher.\r\n\r\nOne day he sat on a little mossy bank by the roadside when she passed\r\nhim, coming from the woods with a bunch of wild flowers in her hands\r\nand going toward her uncle's house. She was close to him, but did not\r\nsee him. Her thoughts were upon her absent lover, and in the\r\nexaltation of her happiness she was oblivious to all about her but her\r\nown joy. The old man's eyes were upon her, however, reading her secret\r\nin her countenance transfigured by love and hope. Ah! how her look\r\nbrought back her mother's face to his remembrance.\r\n\r\n\"Little she would care,\" he said softly to himself, \"for the money\r\nnow. She has love; and that is better than gold.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nWHAT WOULD STEADY SILAS.\r\n\r\nBut when approaching her home, Mary controlled her countenance and was\r\nquite demure. The happy ones do well to hide their felicity, lest the\r\nenvy it would beget should make the world intolerable. And about Uncle\r\nThatcher's house there was an atmosphere that made very easy the\r\nrepression of joyous emotion. It was a square frame dwelling, two\r\nstories high, in a bare sandy yard surrounded on three sides by a\r\nrickety fence of rails and on the forth--the front--by palings, with a\r\ngate in the middle of them. There were no shutters on the windows,\r\nthat looked like great staring dead eyes, sometimes with a blaze of\r\nfury in them when the sun, low in the west, glared upon them; and\r\nthere was no porch, but only a big stone for a step at the door. There\r\nwere no vines trailing against the walls; no flowers in the yard, but\r\nonly weeds in the fence corners; and no trees. Everything that might\r\nhave adorned or softened the expression of the place was lacking. The\r\nbirds always flew swiftly by it and never stopped there to sing.\r\n\r\nAt one end of this cheerless home was a crumbling well-curb, to which\r\ncame often, to draw water, a tall, gaunt, sallow and slatternly woman,\r\nwho continually wore a sun-bonnet and had her sleeves rolled up on her\r\nlean sinewy arms. A tangled wisp of unkempt sandy hair never failed to\r\ndangle below the curtain of the sun-bonnet on the back of her neck.\r\nThat woman was Aunt Thatcher.\r\n\r\nBehind the house, and separated from it by a stable-yard, knee-deep in\r\ntime of rain, with muck and foul green water, stood an old barn, from\r\nwhich was diffused a dull but quite perceptible odor of animal\r\ndecomposition, arising out of a great pile of crude whalebone, or\r\n\"ballein\", and some barrels of whale oil. Uncle Thatcher was captain\r\nof a shore whaling company, and in his barn those articles were\r\ngenerally stored until they could be sent to market. The \"ballein\"\r\nneeded to be kept some time, for cleaning, scraping, and splitting\r\nbefore it could be sold.\r\n\r\nAs Mary reached the gate, she stood still for a few minutes,\r\ncontemplating the scene of thriftlessness and apparent poverty before\r\nher; a picture for which, as she well knew, no good reason existed in\r\nfact, for Uncle Thatcher was by no means a poor man. As captain of the\r\nwhaling crew, his annual gains were considerable. Then he owned a\r\nfishing smack and a large share in a big coasting schooner that plied\r\nfrom Sag Harbor, both of which paid him well. But better than either\r\nof those to him was an industry, the nature and importance of which\r\nMary little understood, although she suspected something of its\r\nmysteries. At certain times each month Uncle Thatcher and one\r\nparticular neighbor used to go fishing in a stout whaleboat rigged\r\nwith a sail, on moonlit nights, and upon those occasions they were\r\nalmost always lucky enough to find one or two casks of rum--doubtless\r\nwashed overboard from some vessel homeward-bound to New Haven from the\r\nWest Indies. (It was wonderful how many casks of rum were thus lost\r\noverboard in those days, just off Napeague Inlet.) Or, by the\r\naccidental use of a grapnel, they would chance to fish up some bottles\r\nof valuable \"bay-oil\" from the bottom. Uncle Thatcher used to bury\r\nthat treasure-trove in the sand, back of his barn, and it always\r\nmysteriously disappeared at night, when nobody was watching it. Yet he\r\nnever seemed to take those losses to heart, but would find and bury\r\nmore rum and bay oil, in the same place, to be lost in just the same\r\nway. \"Smuggling, eh?\" Well, yes. But they didn't call it that. They\r\nspoke of it as \"finding and saving things.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Mary stood at the gate, Uncle Thatcher himself sat upon the\r\nstone door-step, sharpening with a whetstone the edge of a\r\n\"blubber-spade\"--a sort of huge long-handled chisel, used to cut a\r\nwhale's blubber from his carcass and into strips. He was a tall man,\r\nwirily and powerfully built, past middle-age, but still bearing well\r\nhis years. His gray eyes were overhung by exceedingly bushy iron-gray\r\nbrows; his nose was large and beak-shaped; his lips, thin and\r\nstraight; his ears wide and thick; and his hands big and bony, with\r\nthick fingers, flat at the ends and having great joints.\r\n\r\nLooking up from his work, he demanded of the young girl, in a tone of\r\nquerulous surprise, \"Where on earth have you been? I've been looking\r\neverywhere for you to turn the grindstone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm ready to do it now, uncle,\" responded Mary, evading a reply to\r\nhis question by the prompt proffer of her services.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't need you now. Your aunt turned it.\"\r\n\r\nHe gave a few rubs of the whetstone on the shining blade, in an\r\nabsent-minded way, and then laying the long spade across his knees,\r\nand looking sharply at Mary, said slowly, as if carefully choosing his\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\"You don't get used to our way of living out here on the beach, do\r\nyou, Mary? You'd rather be back in the city, where you lived when you\r\nwere a little girl, wouldn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, uncle. My memories of the city do not make me wish to return\r\nto it. Papa and mamma died there, and after we lost papa we had to\r\nlive in a very poor part of the city, where the tall houses hid the\r\nsunshine, and the air was always bad, and there was so much misery,\r\nand dirt, and sickness all about us. Oh, I loathed it as a child, and\r\nit makes me almost sick to think of it now. No, I do not wish to go\r\nback to the city. I like best the bright sunlight and the pure ocean\r\nbreezes. I love even the storms.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if you could live in a nice place in the city?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I think I would be afraid to go back there now.\" While talking\r\nshe had advanced from the gate, and now stood near her uncle.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down here beside me, Mary. I want to talk to you a little,\" said\r\nhe.\r\n\r\nShe obeyed, trembling slightly, for she felt a vague presentiment that\r\nhe proposed pressing a subject that she dreaded. But he was slow to\r\nbegin, seemed to hesitate, and relapsed into thought while he pared\r\nhis already stubby nails upon the sharp edge of the blubber-spade. At\r\nlength, he \"made out his bearings\" and opened the attack.\r\n\r\n\"You know,\" he said, \"that Silas has been a little wild, perhaps, in\r\ndays gone by, as a young man of spirit is most likely to be; but I\r\nhope you have no hard feelings against him on account of his\r\nfoolishness that time. You know he was only a boy, then; and he was,\r\nas you may say, carried away with you, and all struck of a heap when\r\nyou gave him the mitten so plainly. Maybe he deserved all he got that\r\ntime, and I guess it done him good; so we'll call that square and let\r\nby-gones be by-gones. Is that your idea?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, uncle,\" answered Mary timidly, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\"Give us your hand on it.\"\r\n\r\nWith a little smile the girl extended her hand, which Uncle Thatcher\r\ntook very seriously, and treated to a solemn pump-handle-like shake.\r\n\r\n\"And now here's the point,\" he went on, still holding her fingers;\r\n\"Silas is going to settle down and be steady. He wrote to me about\r\nthree months ago, from Boston, and said he'd got work there as a\r\nship-carpenter, and had quit his wild ways, and wasn't going to call\r\non me for any more money. Well, he has kept his own word about the\r\nmoney, and by that I judge he's all right, earning an honest living,\r\nand doing as he said. But he likes living in the city better than down\r\nhere on the beach. And now do you know what would do more than\r\nanything else to keep him steady?\"\r\n\r\nMary shook her head. She had an idea of what he meant, but did not\r\nwish to encourage him in the direction he was tending.\r\n\r\n\"A good wife would,\" said Uncle Thatcher very decidedly.\r\n\r\n\"Then I hope he will succeed in finding one in Boston,\" replied the\r\ngirl, with purposeful evasion of the direct attack.\r\n\r\n\"That's not my idea. I don't want him to marry a Boston girl. I've got\r\nmy eye on a girl who I know is all that a good wife should be, the\r\nvery one that Silas ought to have. You know who I mean. It's you,\r\nMary.\"\r\n\r\n\"A girl should never marry a man she doesn't love, uncle, and I don't\r\nlove Silas.\"\r\n\r\nHe bit his lips, was silent for a moment, and then resumed: \"You're\r\nonly a girl, yet, and can't rightly be expected to know your own mind;\r\nand besides, it's three years since you have seen Silas. You don't\r\nknow how you might feel towards him if you were to see him again now.\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head, for she thought she did know very well, as she\r\nmentally put Silas and Dorn in contrast, but did not answer.\r\n\r\n\"I hope,\" he continued, viewing her with a little growing suspicion,\r\n\"that you've got over that childish notion you had once about that\r\nyoung Hackett chap. He's gone, the Lord knows where, and I'll be\r\nbound, never thinks of you any more. Now, if you marry Silas, I can\r\ngive you a good start in life. I'm not poor, and if you and Silas\r\nprefer to live in the city, why I'll furnish a house for you there\r\nnicely, and start him in some business, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, no, uncle! Please do not talk any more about it. I can't\r\nmarry Silas. Indeed, I can't.\"\r\n\r\nUncle Thatcher's face crimsoned with anger, but he restrained himself,\r\nand said: \"Ah, I suppose you still think that young Hackett will come\r\nback of the same mind that he went away. Aha! Not he! Those young\r\nsailor chaps have a wife in every port. And he'd better not come\r\nsnooping around here, if he does come back, or I'll--\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly breaking off his speech, he sprang to his feet, clutched his\r\nhat from the ground, and started off for the beach, running at the top\r\nof his speed. His quick eye had seen, afar off upon the bluff\r\noverlooking the sea, a man on horseback, who waved, with excited\r\ngestures, a small red flag.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nPURSUIT AND CAPTURE.\r\n\r\nAs Uncle Thatcher ran, so ran his neighbors. Bounding across fields,\r\nleaping fences, rolling down the sandy face of the bluff, they arrived\r\nbreathlessly before a small wooden hut at the foot of a sand dune, a\r\nlittle distance up from the edge of the beach--the boat-house of the\r\nwhaling company. Their captain, having good legs and wind, timely\r\nnotice and the shortest distance to travel, was, as usual, first to\r\nreach the goal, and by the time the crew arrived, had already thrown\r\nopen the large double doors which constituted the entire front of the\r\nhut, revealing within a completely fitted whale-boat that stood\r\nchocked upon ways that ran down into the surf. There was too much\r\nexcitement, and too little breath among the eager men who joined him,\r\nfor waste of words. Each knew his place and busied himself with the\r\nduties pertaining to it. One looked to the harpoons. Another saw that\r\nthe lance was in its place, and the lashing of its wooden cap thrown\r\noff. A third was careful to see that the long line, nicely coiled in\r\nits tub, was free from loops or kinks in the coil. By this time all\r\nthe crew were assembled, and grasping the thwarts of the boat, from\r\nbeneath which the chocks were kicked out, ran her swiftly down to the\r\nwater's edge and launched her, springing in over her sides as she rode\r\nout upon a receding wave. Uncle Thatcher sat in the stern. The bow oar\r\nwas held by Lem Pawlett, a sturdy young fellow who had earned by his\r\nstrength, skill, and courage the envied post of harpooner.\r\n\r\nOnce launched, the men rested on their oars a few moments, and looked\r\nup inquiringly to the man on horseback, as if awaiting a signal from\r\nhim. During this brief period of inaction, a little good-natured\r\nchaffing passed between the younger men in the boat and their\r\ndisappointed neighbors who came too late to take places at the oars.\r\nAll belonged to the same company, but only the first comers were, by\r\ntheir rules, allowed to man the boat. The crew would have fatigue,\r\nperil, possibly death to encounter, but they would also have the\r\nexcitement of the chase and a somewhat greater share of the profits,\r\nin the event of success, than those who remained behind; so there was\r\nalways a great effort made by every man to be first to catch the\r\nsignal of the mounted lookout, who was on the bluffs all day long--and\r\nfirst, if possible, to reach the boat-house.\r\n\r\n\"Aha! There's Dan!\" exclaimed one in the boat. \"This is the third\r\ntime, hand-running, that he has missed going out. It looks as if he\r\nwas afraid since we tackled that finback.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you couldn't run any better than you can row, I'd beat you here\r\nevery time,\" retorted Dan.\r\n\r\n\"I dreamed last night of rolling a bar'l of oil,\" remarked a\r\nmiddle-aged man in the crew, \"and I'd a swore this morning that I'd be\r\nafter a whale before the day was over. I never knowed it to fail.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then,\" answered one on shore, \"you came down and sat on the beach\r\nall day, waiting for the signal. It isn't fair to play dreams on the\r\nrest of us that way, is it boys?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. We've got to pull him out of bed at daylight hereafter, and swear\r\nhim on what he dreamed the night before.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd better not try it. I keep a gun.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you don't know how to load it. You want to come right out of that\r\nboat now, and start fair, Billy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll run you fifty yards on the beach for your place, Billy.\"\r\n\r\n\"That wasn't what the dream meant, Billy.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did it mean then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, that you were going to find a bar'l of rum in the Napeague sedge\r\nnext light of the moon.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a general laugh, for Billy's operations against the peace\r\nand dignity of the customs authorities were, like those of Uncle\r\nThatcher, an open secret among his neighbors.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Uncle Thatcher raised his hand, and all were silent, turning\r\ntheir eyes to the man on the bluff, who was looking through a glass\r\nout upon the sea, while holding his little red flag extended at arm's\r\nlength and still. After a few moments he raised the bit of bunting\r\ntwice above his head, held it motionless for an instant, pointing\r\ntoward the east, then waved it once.\r\n\r\n\"She blows and breaches two points south of east, and a mile away,\"\r\nexclaimed Uncle Thatcher, translating the language of the flag. \"Pull,\r\nboys! Pull away!\"\r\n\r\nWith arrow-like swiftness the boat darted from the shore; but hardly a\r\nsound, as the oars plied rapidly in the rowlocks and the ashen blades\r\nbent in the heaving billows, could have been heard a half-dozen yards\r\naway. Nearer and nearer they drew to the whale, and by this time the\r\nrowers were panting with their exertions; but not a man lost his\r\nstroke, and not a word was uttered save the captain's low and earnest\r\ncaution: \"Harder a port.\" Although so close to the monster that they\r\ncould hear it blow, not one of the crew turned his head.\r\n\r\n\"Up bow!\" commanded the captain.\r\n\r\nIn an instant Lem Pawlett, throwing his oar into the boat, was upon\r\nhis feet, with a harpoon poised in both hands above his head, his face\r\ntoward the bow. He was within four or five fathoms of the whale.\r\nAnother stroke of the oars reduced the distance to two; and then, with\r\na mighty effort, he launched the keen-pointed iron into the huge,\r\nblack, shining mass that lay before him. Quick as thought the\r\nharpooner was in his seat, oar in hand, ready to respond to the\r\ninstantaneously given order, \"Back all!\" And the boat seemed to spring\r\naway from its dangerous proximity to the whale, almost as if its\r\nmotion was a recoil from Lem's powerful stroke. The huge creature,\r\nthus rudely startled, leaped clear of the water, in sudden fright and\r\npain; then darted straight downward toward the bottom. And now ensued\r\nthe most anxious moments of the chase. The line attached to the\r\nharpoon ran out from its coil in the tub abaft of 'midships, around\r\nthe logger-head astern, and thence forward, between the men as they\r\nsat at their oars, and over a roller in the bow, following the fleeing\r\nwhale so fast that it fairly hissed. Lem sat ready with a hatchet in\r\nhis hand to cut it, if necessary, as it might at any moment be, to\r\nsave a man's life. For, should a kink or loop occur in that swift\r\nspeeding rope, and catch one of the crew by arm, or leg, or neck, it\r\nwould either kill him at once or hurl him, like a stone from a sling,\r\ninto the sea, were it not quickly severed.\r\n\r\nFortunately for his hunters, nature has placed the whale under two\r\nserious disadvantages. His field of vision is so limited, owing to the\r\nposition of his eyes, that it is not difficult to approach him closely\r\nif his pursuers are cautious to keep back of his flukes; and he must,\r\nfrom time to time, come to the surface to breathe. However deep and\r\nfar he may plough his way beneath the waves, his enemies know that it\r\nis only a question of time when he will have to come up and subject\r\nhimself to another attack; and however mighty his energies, he must\r\neventually succumb, if the harpoon holds and the line is not cut.\r\n\r\nDown, down went the tortured animal, until the men began to cast\r\nanxious glances at the supply of line remaining in the tub. But\r\npresently the speed slackened. The whale was coming up again. Having\r\nonce more taken breath, and made a violent but vain effort to shake\r\nhimself free by beating the waves with his huge flukes and tail, the\r\nleviathan started off at his highest speed, swimming near the surface.\r\nThe boat, following in his wake, dragged along with such velocity that\r\ngreat sheets of water and crests of foam leaped from her bows, and the\r\ncrew were drenched with spray. Suddenly he again \"sounded,\" as his\r\ndiving toward the bottom is technically termed by whalers. But this\r\ntime his stay beneath the surface was less prolonged. He was becoming\r\nexhausted. Still he continued to make prodigious struggles to escape.\r\n\r\nAt length he lay quivering upon the surface, resting. Swiftly, once\r\nmore, the boat approached him, and Uncle Thatcher, jumping from his\r\nplace at the stern, stepped lightly forward upon the seats, carrying\r\nthe lance, a long, keen-edged and pointed blade of steel. It is the\r\npost of honor, which belongs of right to the officer in command of a\r\nwhale-boat, to give the _coup-de-grace_ to the whale, to launch this\r\nsteel \"into his life.\" With strong and practiced arms Uncle Thatcher\r\ndrove the weapon deep into the monster's vitals, and so quick was he\r\nthat he was enabled to strike with effect a second time before the\r\n\"flurry,\" or death-struggle, began, and the boat again backed away. As\r\nif mad with agony and despair, the dying mountain of flesh beat the\r\nwater about him into foam; rushed frantically to and fro, seeming to\r\nseek his enemies; rolled over and over; all the while, whenever he\r\nspouted, throwing crimson torrents of his life-blood into the air.\r\nGradually he became weaker and weaker; at last was still. The victory\r\nwas won.\r\n\r\nSlowly and laboriously the crew towed the enormous carcass to the\r\nbeach, followed closely by the back fins of several large sharks,\r\nattracted to the place by the scent of the whale's blood.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nSILAS'S FRIEND FROM BOSTON.\r\n\r\nA novel and animated scene was presented at the beach the night after\r\nthe capture of the whale. On a grassy little plateau that sloped\r\ngently down between two low sand-dunes toward the sea, was erected a\r\nrude shed, beneath which, set in brick-work furnaces over bright wood\r\nfires, were two huge kettles for the \"trying out\" of the oil from the\r\nwhale's blubber. Aboard whaling ships it is customary to leave the\r\nblubber to \"ripen\" for several days, in close rooms, before it is put\r\ninto the kettles, as this, it has been ascertained, increases the\r\nyield of oil; but the shore whalemen rarely do this. They simply begin\r\nat once with the tenderest and most easily treated portions, and by\r\nthe time they get through, unaccustomed olfactories in the vicinity\r\ngenerally attest that the \"ripening\" process has been perfected.\r\n\r\nHalf-a-dozen boys fed the furnaces--first with wood, and later with\r\nblubber \"scraps,\" or \"cracklings.\" When not doing that, they scuffled\r\nwith each other, wrestled on the grass, shouted with gleeful\r\nexcitement, and unceasingly munched corn and doughnuts cooked in the\r\nboiling oil. By the ruddy light of a bonfire before the shed, men cut\r\nin strips, with blubber-spades, the enormous masses and slabs of fat,\r\nstripped off the whale's carcass down in the surf, and dragged up here\r\non a low, broad-wheeled wagon, drawn by two scraggy horses. Other men\r\ncarried those strips inside the shed, where one who sat at a raised\r\nbench, with a two-handled knife, \"minced\" them for the kettles. Still\r\nothers tended the kettles; skimming out, from time to time, the crisp,\r\nbrown \"cracklings,\" and adding other masses of fat in their stead;\r\nsometimes ladling the oil into barrels. When not otherwise busy, they\r\nchewed cracklings. Several women came with panfuls of sweet dough,\r\ntwisted in curious shapes, which, when thrown into the seething oil,\r\nwere quickly converted into the toothsome doughnuts in which the boys\r\nso much delighted.\r\n\r\nAt one side laid a great pile of black, fibrous, ragged-looking\r\nmaterial, dug from the mouth of the whale, the \"ballein,\" which, when\r\ncarefully cleaned, dried, split, and otherwise prepared, is known as\r\nthe whalebone of commerce and corsets.\r\n\r\nThe work went on with unabated vigor all that night, and all the next\r\nday, and gave promise of continuing even three or four days longer,\r\nfor the \"trying out\" of the oil from a big whale, as this one was, is\r\nno light task.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the second day a well-dressed stranger appeared at\r\nthe scene of operations, inquiring for Mr. Thatcher; and upon finding\r\nthe grim old veteran--who had as yet taken no rest since starting in\r\npursuit of the whale--introduced himself as a friend of Silas's, from\r\nBoston, and expressed an earnest desire to meet the young man.\r\n\r\n\"Why, he is in Boston,\" said Uncle Thatcher.\r\n\r\n\"He was, but has left there, and I expected to meet him here,\" replied\r\nthe stranger.\r\n\r\n\"Here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I was out of town when he went away, rather suddenly, and so did\r\nnot see him, unfortunately. But he left word for me that he was going\r\nto New York to look for a better job, and would pay a visit to his\r\nfather's on the way.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you knew him well in Boston, did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; oh, yes; knew him very well. He was quite a friend of mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was doing well, I suppose? Working and keeping steady?\"\r\n\r\nThe father's voice faltered slightly; he hesitated a little, and\r\npicked up a bit of crackling, which he munched as a cover to his\r\nanxiety, while he looked wistfully at the stranger.\r\n\r\nThe man from Boston seemed just a little embarrassed, but only for an\r\ninstant, when he answered very reassuringly: \"Steady? Oh, yes. Steady\r\nas a deacon.\" Muttering to himself, \"some deacons, at least.\"\r\n\r\n\"Working at ship-carpentering, I believe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes. Certainly. A fine ship-carpenter he is, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did you see him last?\"\r\n\r\n\"H'm. Well, let me see. It must have been--yes, it was two weeks ago\r\nyesterday. I'm quite disappointed not to find him here.\"\r\n\r\n\"He may have stopped over somewhere on the road a day or two; and if\r\nyou're in no hurry, and will wait for him, you are welcome to stop\r\nwith me. I'll give you Silas's own room.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Thatcher; but I have already made\r\nother arrangements. I have promised to go over and stop with a friend\r\nin the village, and after I have looked on a little while at your very\r\ninteresting industry here, I think I'll go back there, and return\r\nto-morrow. Silas may have come by that time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well. Suit yourself, sir, Mr. ----; I didn't rightly catch your\r\nname--Mr. ----?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ketchum, Mr. Thatcher, Ketchum.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Ketchum. Glad to know you, Mr. Ketchum. Glad to know any friend\r\nof my son Silas's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Make yourself as comfortable as you can, and will you have a little\r\nsomething to take, to keep the cold out?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ketchum said he would not object to having \"a little of something\r\nto take,\" and Uncle Thatcher brought it out of a fence corner, from\r\namong the weeds, in a stone jug, with a corn-cob stopper. But Silas's\r\nfriend from Boston was surprised to find that the jug contained\r\ndelicious \"double-canned\" St. Croix rum, old and of magnificent\r\nflavor, and very accurately and shrewdly thought to himself, \"These\r\nbeach-combers never paid the duty on liquor like that; smugglers here,\r\nI'd bet my life.\"\r\n\r\nHe went over and stood near the kettles.\r\n\r\n\"Was this considered a very large whale?\" he asked the man who was\r\nstirring the oil.\r\n\r\n\"Well, pretty fair-sized.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you call pretty fair-sized?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, a whale eighty feet long is a pretty fair size.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was this one eighty feet long?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long was he, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"About sixty-five feet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you ever really get them eighty feet long?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes. I've killed whales ninety feet long.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've seen 'em a hundred feet long,\" volunteered the man who was\r\nmincing the blubber.\r\n\r\n\"I've know'd 'em to be a hundred and twenty feet long in the Indian\r\nOcean,\" put in another, lifting a pile of minced blubber on a\r\nfour-tined fork, and tossing it into a kettle.\r\n\r\n\"Whales is ketched a hundred and fifty feet long,\" said a\r\nsolemn-looking man, who stood leaning on the handle of his\r\nblubber-spade just outside the shed.\r\n\r\nA little silence fell upon the group, which Mr. Ketchum was the first\r\nto break, again addressing the man at the kettle, asking him:\r\n\r\n\"How much oil will you get out of this one?\"\r\n\r\n\"About eighty bar'ls, I guess.\"\r\n\r\n\"He must have been pretty fat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, so-so.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much have you obtained from one whale?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've seen a hundred bar'ls took.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've helped to 'try out' one hundred and fifty bar'ls from one\r\nwhale,\" said the mincer.\r\n\r\n\"Right whales, full-grown, not uncommon gives one hundred and\r\nseventy-five bar'ls, and sperms has been known to give as high as two\r\nhundred and twenty,\" spoke up the man with the fork.\r\n\r\nThe solemn blubber cutter once more came to the front, leaning on his\r\nspade, and said oracularly: \"I've know'd 'em yield two hundred and\r\nfifty bar'ls.\"\r\n\r\nThe relators of solid facts inside the shed perceived that they had no\r\nchance as long as that untrammelled person with the blubber-spade had\r\nthe advantage of the last call every time, and so relapsed into\r\ntaciturnity.\r\n\r\nUncle Thatcher did not somehow like the look of Silas's Boston friend,\r\nthough he could not tell why, and felt relieved when Mr. Ketchum at\r\nlength took his departure for the village. But when he went home at\r\nmidnight to take a little much-needed rest, he was almost convinced\r\nthat he saw the figure of the stranger near a clump of bushes a little\r\ndistance from the doorway.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Mr. Ketchum came, again, with seemingly unabated\r\ninterest in the process of trying out whale's blubber, and remained\r\nabout the shed all day, waiting with inexhaustible patience for his\r\nfriend Silas.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nTHE PRODIGAL'S RETURN.\r\n\r\nThat third evening, at an early hour, Uncle Thatcher said that he felt\r\nworn out and believed he would go home to bed, as the little sleep he\r\nhad caught the night before had not done him any good. Thereupon Mr.\r\nKetchum said that he, too, felt tired, and would go back to the\r\nvillage at once. Yet two hours afterward Mary Wallace saw, near her\r\nuncle's house, a man who, from his description, seemed to be Silas's\r\nBoston friend. Uncle Thatcher became very uneasy. A feeling like a\r\npresentiment of some impending calamity oppressed him and kept him\r\nawake.\r\n\r\nWhile he lay thus, silent and watchful, by the side of his snoring\r\nspouse, he heard a slight rasping noise, as of a window being\r\ncautiously raised, in an adjoining room at the back of the house.\r\nRising noiselessly, and passing to the apartment whence the sound\r\nproceeded, he reached it just in time to encounter a man who had that\r\nmoment entered by the window and, clutching the intruder, was about to\r\ndeal him a blow, when his hand was stayed by the man saying in a\r\nhoarsely suppressed, yet familiar voice:\r\n\r\n\"Look out, dad, it's me!\"\r\n\r\nSilas had come home. The unhappy father sank down upon a chair and was\r\nsilent for a few moments, mastering his agitation before he could\r\ncontrol his voice to demand:\r\n\r\n\"Why do you come in this way, like a thief in the night?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't want to wake the family up,\" answered Silas, in a sulky\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n\"Where do you come from?\"\r\n\r\n\"Boston.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you leave there?\"\r\n\r\n\"I heard of a chance for a better job in New York, and am going down\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you been working steadily in Boston, and behaving yourself as\r\nyou promised me you would?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a ring of insincerity in the young man's voice that did not\r\nescape his father's notice.\r\n\r\n\"Did you expect to meet a friend here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why of course, dad; I always expect to meet you as a friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean a friend of yours from Boston.\"\r\n\r\n\"From Boston? No. Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a man here looking for you; has been here two days; says he\r\nis a friend of yours.\"\r\n\r\nSilas dropped into a chair and in a low voice muttered an oath.\r\n\r\n\"Sit still there until I get a light. I want to have a look at you,\"\r\nsaid Uncle Thatcher, rising.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, dad. Don't get a light, or--wait a bit. I'll fix it.\"\r\n\r\nSilas quickly stripped of its blankets a spare bed that stood in the\r\nroom and carefully hung them up over the window upon the shade-roller,\r\nso as to prevent any ray of light straggling through to the outside.\r\nHis father waited patiently until this preparation was complete and\r\nthen went to the kitchen, whence he returned in a few moments with a\r\nlighted candle.\r\n\r\n\"Silas, you've been lying to me,\" was his first exclamation at sight\r\nof his son.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what do you want to ask a feller so many questions for?\" was\r\nthe scapegrace's dogged reply.\r\n\r\n\"You have, you young scoundrel. Your face isn't that of an honest\r\nworking-man, and your hands--let me see them! Yes, as I expected.\r\nHonest toil makes hands hard, and rough, and big, as mine are. Yours\r\nare not so. Now tell me the truth about what you've been doing, and\r\nwhat you are up to now--if you can tell the truth--or I'll break your\r\nback, you scamp.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well. There's no use a-makin' a fuss about it. I was at work. Not at\r\nship-carpentering, but at tending bar. I couldn't get anything else to\r\ndo. And I got into a little bit of trouble. That's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"'That's all,' eh? What sort of trouble?\"\r\n\r\nSilas hesitated; the old man, as he well knew by experience, was\r\nalmost certain to look through his most adroitly constructed lies, and\r\nhe did not dare to tell the truth.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't do nothin',\" said he at length, sullenly. \"It was some of\r\nthe rest of the boys, and I was mixed up with them, as they were\r\nfriends of mine--and--I was afraid of being arrested--by mistake.\r\nThat's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! And 'that's all,' eh? And what did your friends, 'the boys,' do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I dunno.\"\r\n\r\nUncle Thatcher gripped his son by the shoulder and stood silently\r\nregarding him for a few moments, as if debating with himself whether\r\nto carry out his threat or not. Then his hand dropped, and he said:\r\n\r\n\"Something tells me not to ask you. You'll either lie to me, or you'll\r\ntell me some truth that, coming from your lips, would sicken my heart\r\nwith shame that you are my son.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't do nothin', I tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No more uncalled-for falsehoods, Silas. You have come here for money,\r\nhaven't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you have a few dollars to spare, I'd like to have some. I'm\r\nbroke.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know why I should waste any more money on you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've always acted like a friend to you, dad. I could have made a good\r\nstake turnin' up your smugglin' business here, but I never did,\"\r\nreplied Silas in a suggestive tone.\r\n\r\nHis father looked at him with a countenance full of disgust, and\r\nanswered grimly: \"Oh, it's hush-money you're after, is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, no; I didn't exactly mean that, dad. But I want to borrow a few\r\ndollars.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when you get them, you'll leave?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nUncle Thatcher left the room. As soon as he was alone Silas proceeded\r\nto make a strange toilette. Drawing a bottle of some fluid from his\r\npocket, he poured its contents sparingly upon a comb that he found on\r\nthe bureau and vigorously combed his hair with it. From sandy brown\r\nhis head quickly became an intense black. Then hunting up his father's\r\nrazor, which he knew was kept in that room, he speedily removed his\r\nred moustache and goatee. While doing this before the mirror, he\r\nnoticed his eyebrows and carefully blackened them. Last of all, he put\r\na false black beard, which he drew from one of his pockets, upon his\r\nchin.\r\n\r\nHis father, returning with a roll of bank-notes in his hand, started\r\nwith surprise at sight of Silas's transformation, and the look of\r\ndisgust deepened on his face; but he made no remark upon it and Silas\r\nwasted no time in offering any explanation. Greedily the young man\r\nclutched the pile of money that was silently extended to him, saying\r\nas he did so:\r\n\r\n\"If that friend of mine from Boston turns up again, try to keep him\r\nhanging around here for a few days, if you can, and don't tell anybody\r\nthat I've been here. And now I'll be off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you wish to see your mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. It's no use. She needn't know I've been here. She'd be sure to\r\nchatter about it. Women are never to be trusted.\"\r\n\r\n\"How are you going?\"\r\n\r\n\"The way I came.\"\r\n\r\n\"Through the window?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's the most direct road to the boat I've left lying in the\r\ncove, and I don't care about going out at the front door, which my\r\ndear friend from Boston, if he's the man I think he is, will probably\r\nbe watching at this moment.\"\r\n\r\nHe made a movement towards the candle to extinguish it.\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\" said the old man. \"Before you go I have a few words to say to\r\nyou. This may be the last time I shall ever see you. I am almost\r\ntempted to say that I hope it may be, for fear I may next have to see\r\nyou in a felon's cell, or perhaps on the gallows, as I can only expect\r\na dark and terrible fate for you. I have done all that lay in my power\r\nto make a decent man of you, and what are you? A hunted fugitive,\r\ndisguised to evade an officer who seeks to arrest you for some crime,\r\nfor such I understand now to be the mission of the man who has been\r\nhere inquiring for you. Now, I never want you to come back here, or\r\nremind me of your existence until you can do so in open day, with a\r\nclear conscience and without fear of any man. I have given you there\r\ntwo hundred dollars, and it's all you'll ever get from me, alive or\r\ndead, if your life does not entirely change. Nor will you ever be able\r\nto squeeze any hush-money from me again. I smuggled, because I was\r\neager to amass money to leave to my son. I will never do so any more.\r\nThat source of income gone will still leave me enough for my lifetime,\r\nwhich will be sufficient, since I have no hope of you; but I will have\r\nnone to waste on a criminal profligate--not another dollar. I'm not a\r\npoor man, it is true, but neither am I rich one, with thousands that I\r\ndon't know what to do with, like the Van Deusts. All I have--\"\r\n\r\n\"Like the Van Deusts?\" interrupted Silas. \"Have they got so much\r\nmoney?\"\r\n\r\n\"All I have,\" continued the old man without noticing the interruption,\r\n\"has been gained by hard work and risk, and you have squandered\r\nviciously enough of my earnings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did the Van Deusts get their money?\"\r\n\r\n\"A distant relative left them a fortune of I don't know how many\r\nthousands. But that is nothing to you. Pay attention to what I am\r\ntelling you. Hereafter you will have to provide for yourself. Choose\r\nyour own way to do it, but I warn you that you will find an honest way\r\nthe best. I did hope to see you marry Mary Wallace. She has a little\r\nmoney coming to her, that I managed to get saved for her out of the\r\nwreck of her father's estate, of which she knows nothing. I thought it\r\nmight as well be kept in the family. But she is a good girl and I can\r\nnever again have the face to urge her to take the hand of my son until\r\nhe proves to me that he is worthy of a decent man's, or woman's\r\nregard. And now, there's your way. Take it, and go.\"\r\n\r\n\"No hard feelin's I hope, dad,\" growled the young man sullenly,\r\noffering his hand.\r\n\r\n\"'Hard feelings,' no. Grief and shame, yes. Go! And the best blessing\r\nI can give you is, may God save you from the gallows.\"\r\n\r\nSilas shuddered, dropped the extended hand which his father had not\r\ntaken, turned to the light and blew it out. Then he took down the\r\nblankets from the window, carefully and noiselessly raised the sash,\r\njumped out into the darkness and disappeared.\r\n\r\nUncle Thatcher stood for a long time at the window listening, waiting,\r\nfearing; but no unusual sound reached his ears.\r\n\r\nThe next morning he found Silas's friend from Boston already at the\r\ntrying-out shed when he arrived there, although it was yet only dawn;\r\nand leading him a little to one side, put to him the direct question:\r\n\r\n\"What did you wish to arrest my son for?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ketchum started slightly, looked sharply at his questioner, and\r\nthen as if comprehending that, however the old man's knowledge of his\r\nerrand was obtained, further attempts at concealment would be useless,\r\nreplied: \"Burglary.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\nTHE NIGHT BEFORE----\r\n\r\nThe days grew long and hot; bees came humming in at open windows; wild\r\nroses bloomed along the roadsides; the blackberries were turning from\r\nred to their riper hue; and the smell of new-mown hay was in the air.\r\nBut still, though weeks had passed since Silas's disappearance in the\r\ndarkness, no one but Uncle Thatcher knew aught of his son's visit, not\r\neven his lean, hard-visaged wife, who sometimes wondered \"why the boy\r\ndidn't write,\" but to whom, on that subject, he made no reply. He\r\nseemed to grow older and more careworn, day by day, but locked his\r\npain and grief in his own breast closely. Not only did he cease from\r\nall attempts to influence Mary in his son's behalf, but even, one day,\r\nwhen he overheard her aunt chiding her sharply for her repulsion of\r\nSilas's suit, he said roughly:\r\n\r\n\"Let the girl alone. She is old enough to choose for herself.\"\r\n\r\nMary could not understand the change that had come over him, but was\r\nvery glad of it, from whatever cause it sprang.\r\n\r\nDorn had been back twice from West Indian voyages and was again away.\r\nAfter probably two more voyages they were to be married. It was all\r\narranged. He had picked out the schooner he intended to buy and knew\r\nher price. He had selected the place he proposed purchasing to build\r\ntheir home, and already--through Lem Pawlett, who acted under Ruth's\r\ndirections, at Mary's instigation--knew what it would cost him; a\r\nmodest sum sufficiently within his means. And he even confessed that\r\nhe had already bought a lot of furniture and stored it in New Haven,\r\nin one of Mr. Merriwether's lofts. Yet in all these negotiations and\r\npreparations, Dorn had not once been seen in the vicinity of\r\nEasthampton by anybody but his betrothed. Her years of struggle with\r\nUncle and Aunt Thatcher on the subject of Silas had inspired her with\r\nan overpowering dread of what they might say or do, if they knew that\r\nshe actually contemplated the definitely conclusive step of marrying\r\nsomebody else than their boy; and yielding to her earnest petitions,\r\nDorn had consented to keep himself carefully out of sight, until such\r\ntime as he was ready to come for her with a pair of fleet horses and\r\ncarry her off to Sag Harbor, to make her his wife.\r\n\r\n\"But I'm sure I don't know what to make of Uncle Thatcher,\" said Mary\r\nto her friend Ruth, in the course of one of their little confidential\r\nevening chats in the woods, \"for he is kinder to me than he ever was\r\nbefore, and never once speaks to me about Silas. Sometimes I even\r\nthink he might not make much fuss about it if I were to marry Dorn\r\nright under his nose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you trust him for that, Mary. There's no telling how these men\r\nwill act, especially the old ones. As a rule, the quieter a man is the\r\nslyer he is, and the more he means mischief. Oh, I tell you, I've\r\nstudied Lem, and--But I haven't told you what Lem is going to do. You\r\nknow, I suppose, that poor Mrs. Richards has heard at last from her\r\nbrother in Philadelphia, and he has sent for her to come to him and\r\nbring her children, and she's going away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I heard Uncle Thatcher talking about it to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that will leave the Van Deust's lower farm without a tenant;\r\nthough it hasn't had one, as you may say, since Richards ran away; but\r\nthen the Van Deusts let her live along on it and do the best she\r\ncould; and I guess that must have been Jacob's doings that she was\r\nallowed to, for I believe that old curmudgeon Peter would have turned\r\nher out when she couldn't pay the rent, if he'd had his own way about\r\nit; and I never did like his looks, anyway, for I never heard of his\r\nhaving a good word or a pleasant face for any woman yet; and I think\r\nwhen a man always looks savage when he sees a woman he--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Ruth! Do go a little slower! You are the wildest talker. And you\r\ndo get a person so mixed up.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I get mixed myself sometimes, too. Where was I? Oh, I was saying\r\nthat Mrs. Richards was going away, and the Van Deust's lower farm\r\nwould be to let. Well, Lem is going up to the Van Deust's to-morrow\r\nmorning to get the lease of it, if he can, and Squire Bodley is going\r\nto be his security; and as soon as he gets it, you must try to be\r\nready, dear, so that we can all get married at the same time, for Lem\r\nis in an awful hurry--and maybe I don't care about waiting a great\r\nwhile longer myself, either.\"\r\n\r\n\"And neither do we,\" exclaimed a cheery, hearty voice at her elbow, as\r\nDorn stepped forward and put his arm around Mary's waist.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you, Dorn Hackett!\" cried Ruth, with a little scream. \"How you do\r\nfrighten a person!\"\r\n\r\n\"So you've been eaves-dropping, have you, sir?\" said Mary, looking up\r\narchly at her lover.\r\n\r\n\"No. I was just standing here waiting, in hope of seeing you, and you\r\ngirls were so busy talking that you walked right up to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how do you come to be at my elbow when I thought you were far\r\naway at sea?\"\r\n\r\n\"We sailed three days ahead of time, and made a much quicker trip than\r\nusual, so that I am over a week ahead of the time Mr. Merriwether\r\nlooked for me. As I was in port, of course I embraced the first\r\nopportunity, when I could leave the schooner in charge of the mate,\r\nand came to see my Mary.\"\r\n\r\n\"How good you are, Dorn,\" whispered the happy girl, pressing his\r\nhands, and with the love-light in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"And how much I love you!\" he whispered in reply.\r\n\r\n\"I guess I'd better be getting along home,\" suggested Ruth, stopping\r\nin the path, in readiness to turn back.\r\n\r\n\"Don't let me drive you away,\" replied Dorn, gallantly. \"It has been a\r\nlong time since we have met, and I have not yet even asked how you\r\nare.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you see I'm quite well, and you haven't really appeared to me to\r\nbe gone away at all, so far as I was concerned, for I've heard so much\r\nabout you all the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Ruth, are you going to tell tales?\" protested Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no. I'm no chatterer. Not the least bit. But I know when I'm in\r\nthe road, and I know it now. Two are company and three are not. And I\r\nsee signs of its getting too warm here for me. So good night, good\r\nfolks. I'll leave you to make your arrangements.\"\r\n\r\n\"So as not to keep you waiting a great while,\" retorted Dorn,\r\nmischievously.\r\n\r\nThe merry little maiden blushed and laughed as she turned and ran away\r\ndown the path.\r\n\r\n\"What a lucky chance that I have found you, darling!\" said the young\r\nman low and tenderly, drawing his beloved closely to his side and\r\nwalking slowly with her. \"And it was only a chance; for of course you\r\ndidn't expect me. But if I had not met you here I think I should have\r\nstormed Castle Thatcher to get sight of you. I do not believe I could\r\nhave waited until another evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if you were so impatient all the three long years you were\r\naway?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, of course I was not, for I knew just how long a time I had to\r\nlook forward to of separation from you, and made my mind up to it. A\r\nman should always be able to make his mind up to bear philosophically\r\nwhat he knows is inevitable. It is only when he is disappointed in\r\nwhat he has every reason to expect, that he has any right to growl.\r\nI've always had a great deal of sympathy with the old prophet who got\r\nso mad about the worm. He had made up his mind, no doubt, to stand\r\nlike a philosopher the heat of the sun when he hadn't any shelter,\r\nthough he did feel the heat mighty bad. But when he got a good shade\r\nover him, and was comfortable, it was enough to make a saint mad to\r\nhave a malicious grub come along and cut down his vine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear; I think you've got the story fixed up your own way, and\r\nare, maybe, not altogether sound upon its moral. But no matter now.\r\nWhen do you go away again?\"\r\n\r\n\"We will not sail for a week or ten days, probably, so that I'll have\r\na chance to come over and see you again, once at least, before we go.\r\nThe owner wants me to wait for the completion of a cargo, and they\r\ncan't be got together before about the time he expected me back,\r\nwhich, as I have already told you, I have forestalled by a week.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the cargo that you speak of as 'they'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mules. And I hate 'em,\" he replied savagely.\r\n\r\n\"You hate them? Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, of all the satanic brutes, the mule is the worst. He has the\r\ncunning and the malice of an imp. Every minute he is awake he is\r\neither planning or executing some mischief, and he's always awake. My\r\ncrew will need a barrel of arnica and an acre of sticking-plaster to\r\ncure them of the bites and kicks they'll get from those mules before\r\nthey are landed in the West Indies. And I suppose we'll have to wear\r\nout a wagon-load of hoop-poles on the brutes to keep them from\r\nrolling the schooner upside down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Dorn! How could they do that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Easily enough. When we are loading them we have to run lines from the\r\nmast-heads to the wharf, to keep them from rolling her over there.\r\nWhen they are shipped, they have to be tied, head to head, along a\r\nbeam running fore and aft, as close as they can well stand. By a\r\nconcerted arrangement among themselves, those on one side will sway\r\ntheir bodies as far back as they can, and those on the opposite will\r\nsway forward. Then they will reverse the motion; and so they'll go\r\nalternately--singing with their sweet voices while they are at\r\nit--backward and forward, giving their motion to the vessel, and\r\nrolling her more and more every moment; and they would very soon have\r\nher on her beam ends if we didn't wade in among them with hoop-poles\r\nto divert them from their fun. And they are liable to play that game\r\nany minute, day or night. Oh, I've taken out one load of mules and\r\nknow what to expect of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dorn, 'a man should always be able to make his mind up to bear\r\nphilosophically what he knows is inevitable.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, I give up. Let's don't talk about mules any more, little\r\nMollie. I get mad when I think about them--even if they do pay well.\r\nBut I have a pleasanter topic. Something to tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that is?\"\r\n\r\n\"That immediately upon my next return home, which will be in about six\r\nweeks, or seven, at the farthest, we will be married.\"\r\n\r\nWhen at length Mary's lover left her that evening and she returned\r\nhome, she was surprised to find Aunt Thatcher sitting on the front\r\ndoor step.\r\n\r\n\"Mary Wallace, I want to know where you've been all this night?\"\r\ndemanded the shrewish woman in a shrill key.\r\n\r\n\"I--met Ruth Lenox--and--we talked and walked,\" answered Mary\r\nhesitatingly, and with very natural evasion of the searching inquiry.\r\n\r\n\"And you've got the face to stand there and tell me that? Well, I\r\nexpected it of you, and made an errand over to Mrs. Lenox's myself,\r\nand Ruth was at home, where a decent young girl should be at night,\r\nwith Lem Pawlett sitting beside her on the porch. So I've caught you\r\nin one story, have I? Now I ask you again where you've been, and I\r\nwant to hear what you've got to say for yourself. Not that I expect to\r\nbelieve a word you say, but I want to hear what kind of a story a\r\nyoung woman can make up for herself after being out all night, nobody\r\nknows where, or who with.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, aunt! I have not been out all night. It is only nine o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's ten minutes past nine,\" retorted the shrew, craning her long\r\nneck around over her shoulder to see the face of the tall clock that\r\nstood against the wall near the bureau, upon which a solitary tallow\r\ncandle gave a smoky yellow light.\r\n\r\n\"Where have you been? I want to know,\" she demanded again.\r\n\"Gallivanting around with some young man, I suppose. I shouldn't\r\nwonder if that Dorn Hackett that you were so much took up with three\r\nyears ago, had come snooping around again. Has he? Eh? Why don't you\r\nanswer me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I--have nothing to say, aunt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oho! you've 'nothing to say,'\" sneered Aunt Thatcher, mimicking the\r\ngirl. \"Well, I shouldn't think you would have, after such goings on. I\r\nbelieve in my soul you've been with that fellow to-night. Can you look\r\nme in the face and tell me you haven't?\"\r\n\r\nNo, Mary could not look her in the face, or anywhere else, and lie\r\nabout it, for she was not accustomed to falsehood, so she held her\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I thought so,\" continued the termagent, with a snarl of\r\nmalicious triumph. \"I thought so. And I know what will come of it. Oh,\r\nyes. But you needn't think to stay in my house when everybody comes to\r\nknow of your disgrace. You can trapse after your lover, who'll be gone\r\nfar enough by that time, no doubt. And what would Silas think of you\r\nif he knew of your conduct? Do you suppose my boy would ever look at a\r\ngirl that get's herself talked about as you will? You shameless--\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut up! There's been enough of this jaw and too much,\" suddenly\r\ninterrupted Uncle Thatcher's rough voice, as he himself appeared in\r\nthe door, looking in his night-dress of close-fitting shirt and\r\ndrawers even bonier, longer, and more angular than ordinarily; like\r\nthe silhouette of a skeleton almost.\r\n\r\n\"I don't care! I will speak!\" snapped his vixenish wife, turning to\r\nface him.\r\n\r\n\"And ef you do I'll choke you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would? You'd raise your hand to the mother of Silas?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and wring your blasted neck if you don't mind me when I tell you\r\nto shut up.\"\r\n\r\nWhether Uncle Thatcher had ever found force necessary to maintain his\r\nauthority in the household or not, was best known to him and his wife;\r\nbut at all events she did not seem to regard his threat as an idle\r\none, for with a snort of baffled rage she sprang up and rushed into\r\nthe house, without uttering another word.\r\n\r\nMary was standing with her back toward the door, with her hands\r\ncovering her face, and crying. Uncle Thatcher laid one of his big\r\nhands on her shoulder and patting it gently, as he would have soothed\r\na horse, said to her:\r\n\r\n\"Come, little girl. Don't cry any more. I ain't a going to have you\r\nplagued out of your life about that cuss. Go to bed now. And just tell\r\nme if she tries to worry you any more.\"\r\n\r\nHe disappeared inside the door, and Mary, wiping her eyes, followed\r\nhim, passing to her little room, but sleep was slow in coming to her\r\nhot eyes and her last waking thought was:\r\n\r\n\"Who did uncle mean by 'that cuss'? Was it Dorn or Silas?\"\r\n\r\nBut at length the weary lids closed and in happy dreamland, far away\r\nfrom care, and fear, and strife, she wandered with her lover.\r\n\r\nThe night wore slowly on. Incoming billows of the rising tide moaned\r\nsullenly upon the sandy beach and sent a rustling hiss through the\r\nshivering reeds and rushes in marshy inlets; whippoorwills piped from\r\nthe cover of the leafy wood and drowsy cocks, awaking at the midnight\r\nhour, called to each other from their barn-yard roosts. All other\r\nsounds of motion and of life were hushed, save that an owl darted in\r\nsudden fright from one of the Van Deust elms, at sight of a pale-faced\r\nman who sprang out of a back window of the old homestead and ran down\r\nthe lane, looking back over his shoulder and wiping blood from his\r\nhands, as he ran.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\nWHAT LEM PAWLETT DISCOVERED.\r\n\r\nIt was on the morning succeeding that night, that Lem Pawlett and\r\nSquire Bodley made the discovery of the murder of Jacob Van Deust, as\r\nhas already been described. As the reader will remember, the neighbors\r\nassembled about the corpse of the murdered man, believed that they had\r\ngrounds for suspecting Peter Van Deust of the assassination of his\r\nbrother, and even discussed the advisability of his arrest. He,\r\nunconscious of the ugly rumors afloat about him, and regardless of the\r\ndark looks of those by whom he was surrounded, lay upon his face in\r\nhis room, weeping as one without hope for the lifelong companion so\r\ncruelly reft from his side. He had never known, until death parted\r\nthem, how dear to him was his gentle-hearted brother and how very\r\nlonely the world would be without him. And every unkind passionate\r\nword he had uttered, and every selfish thought to which the evil\r\npromptings of avarice had given birth in his heart, since that unlucky\r\nfortune came them, seemed now to rise up before him like an accusing\r\nghost, so that the old man, burying his face in his hands, sobbed\r\naloud:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Jacob, Jacob! I am so sorry for it all.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps the spirit freed from that weak lump of clay in the crimson\r\npool, might have heard the cry and, knowing the true meaning and the\r\npenitence of the sorrowing heart, have well forgiven; but a neighbor,\r\nleaning against the door-post and peering curiously in at the\r\ngrief-stricken old man, turned quickly to his comrade without the\r\nthreshold and exclaimed in a low excited whisper:\r\n\r\n\"Gosh! Joe. He's just as good as owned up that he did it, and says\r\nhe's 'sorry for it' now, 'cause he's scared of being found out.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then by the time this had been repeated to a half-dozen--as it was\r\nin little more than as many minutes--those who heard the story last,\r\nlearned that Peter had just made to somebody a full confession of\r\nhaving murdered his brother. But in the very height of the excitement\r\nto which this gave rise, Lem Pawlett, who was still prying about the\r\nroom, with something of an instinctive detective genius guiding his\r\nmovements, made an important discovery.\r\n\r\nDrawing aside the figured chintz curtains that hung close over the\r\nback window of the dead man's room, he noticed that a mud-wasp's nest\r\nof clay had fallen to the sill, from the place where the insect had\r\nstuck it in the angle of the sash and frame of the window, two or\r\nthree feet above. Knowing how firmly the ingenious little builders of\r\nthose houses are accustomed to place them, he recognized that some\r\nunusual violence must have been employed to break it loose. That it\r\nhad not been intentionally knocked down was probable, else the clay\r\nwould not have been left littering the window sill. That the mischief\r\nhad been freshly done, was manifest. He tried the sash, and found that\r\nit could easily be lifted. Its only fastening had been a nail, thrust\r\ninto a hole in the frame above the sash; but rust had corroded the\r\nnail to merely a thin rotten wire. The head of it came off in his\r\nfingers, when he felt it, and he observed that it had been broken,\r\nwith what seemed a fresh fracture, just where it entered the frame. It\r\nmust, he thought, have been broken by some one lifting the sash from\r\nwithout, as a person opening the window from the inside would have\r\nbeen likely to pull it out first, as a matter of convenience. He\r\nraised the sash fully, and uttered an exclamation of surprise, the\r\nfirst sound that had called anybody's attention to his investigations.\r\n\r\nThere, plain to be seen in the soft black wood of the old sill, were\r\ntwo deep dents that appeared to have been made by some flat,\r\nsquare-edged metal instrument, an inch wide. The one beneath that side\r\nof the sash upon which the nail was broken off, was a little the\r\ndeepest. Upon the bottom of the sash, on the outer side, were two deep\r\nimpressions corresponding with the dents in the sill, and seemingly\r\nmade by the same instrument, which, as Lem judged, was some sort of a\r\nstout chisel, used as a lever. All the marks were fresh.\r\n\r\nThe loose earth of the little garden just beneath the window, where\r\nthe drip of the eaves had kept it soft and damp, showed the treading\r\nthere of feet shod in high-heeled and square-toed shoes, or boots,\r\nsuch as might have been made for city wear, and not at all like those\r\nworn in the country. Following those tracks, they led Lem, and the\r\ncrowd now at his elbow, to a point where the weight of a person\r\ncrossing the rickety old \"worm\" fence had broken a rotten rail; and,\r\nnear by, one of the high-heeled shoes had trodden down the stem of a\r\nlily that was in its path. The fracture of the rail was fresh, and the\r\nlily, broken from its stem and lying on the humid earth, was not yet\r\nwithered. But the high heel had crushed one of its snowy petals.\r\n\r\nIn the lane, outside the fence, the tracks were lost.\r\n\r\nThe importance of these discoveries was at once apparent, even to the\r\ndullest of comprehension; and there was no longer a question in the\r\nminds of any but that the murder had been committed by some burglar\r\nwho had entered through the window, and that old Peter was innocent.\r\nThe reflection that there was in the community some one capable of\r\nsuch an awful deed, or that somebody from the wicked world outside had\r\ncome among them to strike so terrible a blow, sent a thrill of mingled\r\nhorror and fear through all present.\r\n\r\n\"Gracious alive!\" exclaimed a very old man, whose hollow cheeks,\r\nsunken and bleary eyes, white hair, and tottering limbs suggested that\r\nthe least possible thing of which he could be robbed was his remnant\r\nof life, \"we are none of us safe in our beds with such goings on!\"\r\n\r\n\"No. But the man who did this must be found and punished,\" responded\r\nLem Pawlett, excitedly.\r\n\r\n\"Sake's a mercy! Who can ever find out such things? The man that did\r\nit isn't going to tell on hisself!\"\r\n\r\n\"God's finger will point him out,\" said Squire Bodley, solemnly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, maybe so. But--I dunno,\" murmured the old man, whose faith in\r\nProvidence seemed somewhat shaky.\r\n\r\nSquire Bodley picked out a jury, and announced to all assembled that\r\nhe would hold the inquest at his office in the village one week from\r\nthat date, at six o'clock in the afternoon, at which time he hoped any\r\nperson who might meanwhile become cognizant of any new facts that\r\nmight have even the smallest possible bearing upon the subject to be\r\ninvestigated, would come before him and make them known. And--as it is\r\nalways the theory among country people that a crime among them must\r\nhave been perpetrated by some one from the nearest city--he exhorted\r\nall to use their utmost diligence to learn whether any suspicious\r\nstrangers had lately been seen in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon he despatched a message to New York, requesting the\r\nassistance of an experienced professional detective, to aid in\r\ndissipating the mystery that seemed to overhang the murder of poor\r\nold Jacob Van Deust, who, on the second day after his death, was laid\r\naway among the dust of many other Van Deusts in the village graveyard.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\nTHE INQUEST.\r\n\r\nDuring the week preceding the inquest, the Van Deust murder was the\r\nconstant theme of conversation through all the country-side; and when\r\nthe important day arrived upon which Squire Bodley proposed to begin\r\nthe official investigation into the affair, people came thronging into\r\nEasthampton from all directions; on horseback, afoot, in old-fashioned\r\ncarryalls, and upon rough farm-wagons; as if every homestead within\r\nten or fifteen miles around had been emptied for the occasion. It was\r\nnot mere curiosity by which they were actuated, but an earnest and\r\nwidely-spread desire to aid in the discovery and procure the\r\npunishment of the assassin; for in those days there was no community\r\non Long Island, as there has since appeared to be, in which murder\r\nwould be popularly winked at and condoned, and its perpetrators,\r\nthough known, permitted to go unscathed of justice.\r\n\r\nSquire Bodley's office was a small, one-story building, without any\r\nother partitions than a railing that shut in about one-third of it,\r\nwhere his table customarily stood. The sign \"Lumber\" over its one\r\ndoor, indicated that the worthy magistrate did not confine his\r\nenergies to his judicial duties. There were three windows--one\r\nopposite the door and one in each end--of such a good convenient\r\nheight from the ground that a man standing outside could rest his\r\nelbows on either of the sills, and witness comfortably all that\r\ntranspired within. Long before the hour for the commencement of the\r\nproceedings, the space outside the railing was densely packed; the\r\nlower halves of the windows were filled with elbows and heads; and as\r\nmany people as could find standing room within sight or hearing, upon\r\nwagons drawn up near the windows and door, were already perched and\r\nwaiting, while many late comers wandered uneasily about, watching for\r\nsome one in the front racks to give out through sheer exhaustion, and\r\nresign his advantageous place.\r\n\r\nAs a preliminary proceeding, the Squire had his sashes removed\r\nentirely from their frames, and carried away to a place of safety; but\r\neven yet the little room was oppressively hot and close. Then candles\r\nhad to be brought and lighted, for although it was midsummer, when the\r\ndays are long, this evening was cloudy, and but little of the dull\r\nlight could penetrate through the crowded windows. So it was that it\r\nwas almost seven o'clock when the Squire finally got himself seated at\r\nhis table, with three candles, pen, ink and paper before him, that he\r\nmight write down the evidence, and called the first witness.\r\n\r\nThat first witness was Lemuel Pawlett, who was somewhat abashed by his\r\nposition, and had a little difficulty, at first, in understanding that\r\nhe was required to give a circumstantial account of the finding of the\r\nbody of the murdered man, and what followed thereupon.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you know all about it, Squire, as well as I do. You were with\r\nme. What's the use of telling you?\"\r\n\r\n\"But I have to write down your statement, as your evidence, Lem, not\r\nsimply for my own knowledge, but for others, to promote the ends of\r\njustice. Go ahead and tell your story as if you were telling it to\r\nthese people here, and never mind what I know about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Squire;\" and Lem, turning his back upon the Squire, began\r\nreciting the affair to the audience. \"Him and I went up to Van Deust's\r\na week ago to-day--\"\r\n\r\n\"Who do you mean by 'him?' Who accompanied you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you! You yourself, Squire, you know you did!\"\r\n\r\nBut at length the little difficulty of starting him aright was\r\novercome, and then Lem went ahead, telling his story in a plain,\r\nstraightforward way, and the Squire duly wrote it all down.\r\n\r\nTwo neighbors corroborated Lem's narration of the finding of the\r\ntraces of the burglarious entry and the flight of the assassin.\r\n\r\nDeacon Harkins volunteered testimony as to having overheard quarrels\r\nand interchange of threats of violence between the Van Deust brothers\r\nmore than once. At this old Peter, who sat near the Squire, became\r\ngreatly excited. Springing to his feet, trembling with emotion, and\r\nwith his voice pitched to a high, unnatural key, he cried:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is true. I did threaten my brother--God forgive me!--more\r\nthan once. I was mean enough, cruel enough, wicked enough to say\r\nharsh, spiteful things to wound that gentle soul; but I never meant\r\nhim harm. No. The One above, who reads all hearts, knows well that I\r\nwould rather my right hand withered, rather put it into the fire and\r\nburn it off than raise it against Jacob's life. We wrangled sometimes,\r\nas old men will--no, _he_ didn't, the fault was all mine. And oh, to\r\nthink that he is gone, without my being able to ask him to forgive\r\nme!\"\r\n\r\nHis voice broke, and he dropped exhausted upon a chair, letting his\r\nface fall forward upon his arms, on the end of the Squire's table,\r\nwhere he wept bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"Arthur Wiltsey!\" called the Squire.\r\n\r\nA stout, plainly dressed, and honest looking countryman took the\r\nstand, and, having been sworn, testified:\r\n\r\n\"Last Thursday afternoon--\"\r\n\r\n\"The day succeeding the discovery of the murder of Jacob Van Deust?\"\r\ninterrupted Squire Bodley.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. The day after the murder. I was passing through the neck of\r\nwoods on the lower end of my place--\"\r\n\r\n\"How far is your place from the Van Deusts'?\" asked the Squire.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you know, Squire, as well as I do! I bought the place off you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind about what I know. Tell us what you know. How far is your\r\nplace from the Van Deusts'?\"\r\n\r\n\"About a mile and a half.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well. About a mile and a half. Go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"When near a path that makes a short cut to the Babylon road, I found\r\nthese things. They were lying among some huckleberry bushes, and the\r\nwhite bag was the first thing that caught my eye. Afterwards I saw the\r\nother.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he drew from his pocket and deposited upon the Squire's\r\ntable, two objects: an old worn-out sheepskin wallet, and an empty\r\ncanvas bag about nine inches long by three in width, and tied around\r\nwith a bit of fishing line.\r\n\r\n\"The bit of string,\" continued the witness, \"was a few feet away from\r\nthe other things; but I judged it might belong to them, and fetched it\r\nalong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever seen these things before, Mr. Van Deust?\" asked Squire\r\nBodley.\r\n\r\nThe old man who, buried in his freshly-awakened grief and remorse, had\r\npaid no attention to what was going on until he was called by name,\r\nlooked up dazedly. The Squire pushed before him the objects found by\r\nthe witness. He looked at them for a few moments, silently and without\r\nmoving, as if fascinated by them; then slowly reached out his\r\ntrembling hands, and took them up.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said, with an effort, after having carefully examined them,\r\n\"I recognize them. They belonged to my brother Jacob--his wallet and\r\ncoin bag. And I know that the wallet, at least, was in his possession\r\nthe day before he was found dead.\"\r\n\r\nAbsolute stillness reigned in the dense crowd from the commencement of\r\nFarmer Wiltsey's testimony until the conclusion of Peter Van Deust's\r\nidentification of his brother's property; and then such a buzz of\r\nexclamations, and remarks, and conjectures broke out that the Squire\r\nwas compelled to rap vigorously on his table, and call \"Order!\" and\r\n\"Silence!\" more than once before he could proceed with the business.\r\nBut there was little more to be offered.\r\n\r\nOne man thought he had heard a horse galloping down the Babylon road\r\nabout one o'clock on the morning of the discovery of the murder, but\r\nhe did not know if anybody was on the horse, and was not even positive\r\nthat it was a horse he heard; it might have been a cow. So his\r\nevidence went for nothing.\r\n\r\nPeter Van Deust testified, very briefly, that the last time he saw his\r\nbrother alive was about half-past nine o'clock on the night of his\r\ndeath. An old gentleman, a friend from New York--their lawyer in\r\nfact--had visited them in the afternoon on business, and had gone away\r\na little while after supper. Then they sat up somewhat later than\r\nusual, talking over what they would do with their lower farm, which\r\nwould be left without a tenant when the Richards family moved away. He\r\nhad looked at the clock when he went to bed, and knew it was half-past\r\nnine. Jacob was then in his usual health and spirits, except that he\r\ncomplained a little of a slight cough, and it was the witness's\r\nimpression that his brother, after going to bed, had called old Betsy\r\nto prepare him something to alleviate that. But he was not very sure\r\nabout that, as he was almost asleep at the time, and had not thought\r\nto speak to Betsy about it since.\r\n\r\nSquire Bodley hesitated as to whether he should press any inquiry\r\nabout the friend from New York, and cast an inquiring look at a\r\nstranger who sat near him. But the stranger, who seemed to understand\r\nperfectly what he would have asked, made a slight negative sign. Still\r\nthe Squire was not satisfied and, leaning over to him, whispered:\r\n\r\n\"That New Yorker must have been there nearer the time of the murder\r\nthan anybody else outside the family; most likely knew the old man had\r\nmoney in the house, and just where it was kept; may have laid around\r\nuntil all was quiet, and then gone back to--\"\r\n\r\n\"It's quite possible he did,\" interrupted the stranger, in a tone\r\naudible only to the Squire, \"and I'm not losing sight of it; but it\r\nwon't do to bring out too much on the inquest. He might get wind of\r\nthe suspicion against him and skip. Never show your hand if you want\r\nto win.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" assented the Squire, doubtfully, \"if you say so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, it's all right. Keep it shady, and I promise you the man\r\nfrom New York will be turned up in good time.\"\r\n\r\nPeter Van Deust's evidence was closed.\r\n\r\nBlack Betsy was the last witness. She said that on the night of the\r\nmurder, at about half-past ten o'clock, Jacob called her up to prepare\r\nhim something for his cough. She was lying down at the time, but not\r\nasleep, as rheumatism mostly troubled her a good deal in the early\r\npart of the night, and went to him as soon as he called. Having made\r\nfor him a cough mixture of honey, vinegar, and rum, she gave it to\r\nhim; he bade her good-night, and she went back to bed. Being asked how\r\nshe knew it was half-past ten when he called her, she said that she\r\nknew it by the line of the full moonshine on her floor, and was\r\npositive that she could not have been more than ten minutes wrong at\r\nfarthest. After returning to her bed the rheumatism kept her awake\r\nabout an hour, she supposed, or maybe an hour and a half. Then she\r\ndropped asleep, and did not awake until called up by Squire Bodley and\r\nMr. Pawlett. Her hearing, she affirmed, was very good, and she was\r\nsure that from the time she gave Jacob his medicine until she went to\r\nsleep there were no unusual noises about the house.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\nA STAB IN THE DARK.\r\n\r\nSquire Bodley adjourned the inquest for another week, in the hope that\r\nthere might be discovered in the interim some further evidence, and\r\nhis sweltering office was quickly cleared of jury, witnesses, and\r\nauditors, all save one man, the stranger to whom he had whispered\r\nwhile Peter Van Deust was on the stand. That person, a ruddy,\r\nsmooth-faced man of medium height, and probably forty or forty-five\r\nyears of age, with nothing distinctive about his appearance except,\r\nperhaps, a pair of very keen gray eyes, was the detective who had been\r\nsent from New York to apply his sagacity to ferreting out, if\r\npossible, the robber and assassin of Jacob Van Deust.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Turner,\" said the Squire, lighting his one remaining candle\r\nby the flickering flame of the last surviving of the three that had\r\nmelted and guttered down to the sockets of the candlesticks, \"I guess\r\nthis will be light enough for us to see to talk a little by. What do\r\nyou think of the case?\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't so blind as some I've had hold of, and cleared up, too; but\r\nit is dark enough, nevertheless. All I can see that we may say we\r\nthink we know is, that the old man was killed, probably after 11:30 or\r\n12 o'clock at night, by a burglar who got into his window by means of\r\na jimmy and who, after killing him and robbing the premises, escaped\r\nby the Babylon road, most likely.\"\r\n\r\n\"I neglected to bring it out when he was on the stand, but Peter has\r\ntold me that some other articles besides the money are missing; a set\r\nof garnet jewellery belonging to his mother that Jacob always kept in\r\nhis room; an old silver watch and a heavy square onyx seal, with a\r\nfoul anchor cut on one side of it. None of them of any great value.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's just as well you didn't mention them; just as well or better.\r\nSuch things, if looked for quietly, and nothing said about them, are\r\nsometimes valuable clues. And it is well you didn't ask about the\r\nlawyer from New York. All these are things we will have to look into\r\nquietly. There's nothing like doing things quietly. The great trouble\r\nabout inquests, generally is, that they bring out the very things\r\nwhich put criminals on their guard, and so make the detective's work\r\nall the harder--sometimes even baffle him altogether.\"\r\n\r\n\"Squire, are you busy?\" demanded a sharp nasal voice.\r\n\r\nThe two men looking up, and shading the candlelight from their eyes\r\nwith their hands, saw standing in the door a tall, thin,\r\nscraggy-looking woman, wearing a sun-bonnet.\r\n\r\n\"No, not particularly. Walk in, Mrs. Thatcher, walk in. What can I do\r\nfor you?\" replied the Squire.\r\n\r\nThe woman came forward with shuffling, hesitating steps; paused, made\r\na furtive attempt to poke up out of sight the wisp of unkempt sandy\r\nhair, dangling in its accustomed place on the back of her neck; and\r\nfinally answered, with a doubtful look at the stranger:\r\n\r\n\"Well, I had something to tell you, private-like, about that murder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed! Well, you can speak right out before this gentleman. He is\r\nhelping me to inquire into it. But why, if you have anything to tell,\r\ndid you not come up to the inquest?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't care to speak before so many folks; and I thought it would\r\nbe better to tell you quietly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is it you have to tell me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I expect, Squire, I know who killed Jake Van Deust.\"\r\n\r\n\"The deuce you do!\" exclaimed the detective, bouncing in his seat.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir; I was told what the Squire said a week ago to-day about\r\nsuspicious strangers in the neighborhood, and I thought to myself, I\r\nknow of one, and I ought to tell him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's a young man who used to live in this neighborhood, but who\r\ndisappeared--ran away, I guess, for some reason best known to\r\nhimself--about three years ago or a little better. He's been back\r\nlately, hiding around in the woods and meeting a foolish girl--\"\r\n\r\n\"Aha!\" interrupted the detective, with a chuckle, and rubbing his\r\nhands; \"if there's a girl in the case, we'll have him, sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, a foolish girl, who don't know the sin and the shame of\r\nwhat she's a-doing. And as far as I can find out, he has kept himself\r\nout of sight of everybody but her. But he was about the neighborhood\r\nlate on the night that Jake Van Deust was killed--that I'm sure of;\r\nand met the girl that night--I know he did.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who is the girl?\"\r\n\r\n\"My niece, Mary Wallace, sir. The more's the pity!\"\r\n\r\n\"And the young man?\"\r\n\r\n\"His name is Dorman Hackett.\"\r\n\r\nSquire Bodley gave a gasp of surprise. He remembered Dorn Hackett as a\r\nstrong, handsome orphan lad who had grown up almost to manhood in the\r\nneighborhood; a young fellow with a fine, frank, courageous face, and\r\nof whom he had never before heard an evil word; but he remembered,\r\ntoo, now that he came to think of it, that he had not seen the young\r\nfellow for a long time; and sighed to think that even the best boys\r\nsometimes grow up to be very wicked men when exposed to the\r\ntemptations of vicious life in the great cities, and it was possible\r\nthat Dorn Hackett, like many others, \"had gone to the bad.\"\r\n\r\n\"You say that this young man has been away for three years?\" asked the\r\ndetective.\r\n\r\n\"He hasn't dared to let anybody here, except that girl, see his face\r\nfor that long.\"\r\n\r\n\"And of course you know nothing of where he has been, and what he has\r\nbeen doing all that time?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; how should I? Loafing around New York, I dare say. Such\r\ncharacters mostly goes there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Around New York, eh? If he's a New York thief, I'll be sure to know\r\nhim. If we only knew what he's been doing.\"\r\n\r\n\"What would a fellow be likely to be doing who has no trade, and no\r\nmoney, and no home, and no respectable friends, and nobody to see to\r\nhim?\" snapped Aunt Thatcher.\r\n\r\n\"He might have told your niece.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he did, she wouldn't be likely to tell me. It's as much as I could\r\ndo to find out that he was sneaking around here in the woods, late on\r\nthe night Jake Van Deust was killed.\"\r\n\r\n\"She met him that night, did she?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, she did.\"\r\n\r\n\"What kind of a looking person in this Hackett?\"\r\n\r\n\"A big, ugly, red-headed fellow, with a face like a bull-dog.\"\r\n\r\nSquire Bodley smiled gently to himself, thinking how such a\r\ndescription would be apt to assist the detective. He had penetration\r\nenough to discern that there was some animus in the woman's mind\r\nstronger than a mere desire to aid the ends of justice; but said\r\nnothing about it at the time, feeling a little timid about seeming to\r\ninterfere in the work of the professional detective.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Turner and the squire had both thanked Mrs. Thatcher for her\r\n\"valuable information,\" she took her departure, and the two men were\r\nleft alone to discuss the course to be pursued. Squire Bodley had a\r\nvery good opinion of Mary Wallace; and if he had had his own way would\r\nhave directly questioned her about her lover; but against that course\r\nthe detective strenuously protested. Direct ways are never the chosen\r\nmethods of the professional fishers of men.\r\n\r\n\"By no means,\" said he. \"Let the girl know that her lover is suspected\r\nand she will be sure to get word to him somehow and he'll be off. Not\r\na word about it to anybody. Leave me to work it out my own way, and my\r\nname isn't Richard Turner if I don't soon lay my hand on the shoulder\r\nof Dorman Hackett.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\nA JOLLY, JOLLY SHIPMATE.\r\n\r\n\"The Whaler's Haven\" was in those days a place of no small pretensions\r\nand of no mean fame among the sailormen of New London, which was then\r\nquite an important shipping town, especially for the whaling interest.\r\n\r\nRailroad tracks now cover the ground it then occupied, and the cutting\r\naway of the bluff in that vicinity, to give place for some heavy\r\nindustries that require to be near the water and the iron road, has\r\ncompletely changed the appearance of all the surroundings, even, of\r\nthat once favorite resort of the marine element of the population of\r\nthe town, so that not one trace of it remains, save in memory. But it\r\nis not of the present we have to treat, or the many changes--some of\r\nthem very sad ones--that have been wrought in the maritime interests\r\nof our coast. Our story dates back to a time when a big American flag\r\nfloated above a long and wide two-story frame building where those\r\nrailroad tracks now lie; a building that was further adorned, as to\r\nits peak, by a carved and painted wooden statue of the goddess of\r\nliberty, that seemed to have been the figurehead of some vessel; and\r\nas to its front, by a very widely-spread and gayly-gilded American\r\neagle, holding in its beak, over the door, a huge and brilliantly red\r\nscroll, upon the flaming convolutions of which, in brightest blue, one\r\nmight read the legend \"The Whaler's Haven.\"\r\n\r\nBy day, there was little, except its size, to distinguish the Haven,\r\nto the eye of the casual observer, from several other establishments\r\nof kindred character in the vicinity; but at night, in the figurative\r\nlanguage of Jonathan Schoolcraft, its proprietor, \"the eagle\r\nscreamed.\" Then, until hours that were at once late and early--late\r\nfor revel and early for labor--the fiddle squeaked out jigs and reels;\r\nthe thumps and shuffles of dancing feet made the walls vibrate and the\r\nwindows jingle; glasses clinked merrily; noisy laughter, cheers, and\r\nsometimes--but not often--sounds of quarrel, broke upon the night. It\r\nwas Schoolcraft's boast \"that a sailor never was robbed in this\r\nhouse;\" and, truth to tell, he made the claim good, farther than most\r\nmen do who keep such establishments and make like affirmations. Over\r\nthe little bar, near the front door was a sign in letters so prominent\r\nthat they might have been regarded as a sort of painted shout,\r\ncommanding patrons of the house: \"Have your fun in a decent way;\" and\r\nJonathan was never weary of repeating that counsel to his guests. He\r\nwould not let a sailor in his house get too drunk--that is, too drunk\r\nto be able to find his money, when the liquor was to be paid for--and\r\nhe was sternly opposed to fights in the Haven; for, as he said, \"they\r\nbreak the peace, and break heads, and sometimes break glasses, which\r\nis worst of all.\"\r\n\r\nOne sultry evening in July, when it was too hot to dance and almost\r\ntoo warm to drink rum, a cloud of dullness seemed to settle down upon\r\nthe Whaler's Haven. Jonathan himself went out for a walk, to get cool;\r\nthe barkeeper languidly leaned over the bar and yawned; only four or\r\nfive sailors--boarders in the Haven when on shore--lounged between the\r\ndoor and the bar, \"swapping yarns\" concerning their seagoing\r\nexperiences, and all feeling so depressed and spiritless, through the\r\nheat, that they almost stuck to the truth in their narrations; and two\r\nor three of them were talking of going to bed, when a stranger, who\r\nwas evidently not a sailor, entered, called for a drink, and invited\r\nall present to join him. A stranger who was not a sailor was always\r\nthe object of a little suspicion in the Haven; still none present\r\ncared about offending one who introduced himself so courteously, and\r\nthe waiting sailors took their rum just as naturally as if liking, and\r\nnot simply complaisance, gave it its relish. Then one of them returned\r\nthe stranger's treat and soon another; and another, so that in a\r\nlittle while the heat was forgotten, tongues began to wag freely, the\r\nyarns became much more spirited, and the impression gained ground that\r\nthe stranger was a right good fellow.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was that, without his ever being able to tell exactly how it\r\ncame about, Billy Prangle, a stout old sailor, found himself in almost\r\nconfidential conversation with the pleasant stranger--a smooth-shaven,\r\ngray-eyed, ruddy man of forty or forty-five years--upon the subject of\r\nhis friend and ex-shipmate, Dorn Hackett.\r\n\r\n\"A nobler, braver lad never signed articles,\" said he, \"nor a better\r\nsailorman. We messed together for three years; and take him by and\r\nlarge, alow and aloft, I make bold to say that of the sixteen men in\r\nthe fo'cas'le,--and all good men, too, mind you--he was the best.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm delighted to hear you speak so highly of him,\" replied the\r\nstranger, with apparent heartiness, \"How long is it since you sailed\r\nwith him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only a little better than four months ago. We came off the cruise\r\ntogether, fishing in the North Pacific.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fishing? I thought you said he was in a whaling vessel?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, so I did, my hearty. We calls whales fishes. When we speak of\r\ntaking a whale we always says taking a fish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, excuse me. I didn't understand. And where is your friend now?\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment one of the old sailors called him aside and said to him\r\nin an undertone:\r\n\r\n\"Mind your eye, Billy. I've been a listenin' to you and that lubber\r\nthat doesn't know a whale's a fish, and it looks squally to me. As I\r\nmake him out, he's been a leadin' you on to talk about Dorn Hackett,\r\nand maybe it ain't for Dorn's good he means it.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I thought he meant the boy any harm he'd get his nose rove foul in\r\nthe shake of a fluke.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, just keep your weather eye skinned on him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, shipmate, it's as good as saying that Dorn may be in some sort\r\nof a scrape to be afraid to talk about him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so he may; and small blame to him, either, bein' a likely young\r\nfellow as he is. Shore is a mighty dangersome place for a good-looking\r\nyoung fellow like him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right you are, shipmate,\" assented Billy, solemnly shaking hands\r\nbefore returning to his conversation with the stranger. From that time\r\nhe did watch carefully; and having a little natural cunning of his\r\nown, managed to evade the numerous and artfully-put inquiries with\r\nwhich he was plied, and still to draw the stranger on, with hope of\r\ninformation, until he satisfied himself that his comrade's warning was\r\nnot uncalled for.\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on the drinks were call on freely, and the\r\nstranger unconsciously was falling a victim to the fiery potency of\r\nthe rum--a beverage to which he was not accustomed. He had tried to\r\nevade anything more than a mere show of drinking it, but believed that\r\nthis was looked upon with such suspicion by all about him, that it was\r\nbetter for him to drink and trust to the hardness of his head to carry\r\nthe liquor off safely. Little he knew how much he lacked of being a\r\nmatch for that tough old tar, Billy Prangle, in the consumption of\r\nthat seductive but treacherous fluid. Gradually he lost his customary\r\ncaution; and finding himself baffled in all his attempts to \"pump\" the\r\nold sailor, conceived that it would be a good idea to offer Billy a\r\nhundred dollars if he would conduct him to and point out Dorn Hackett.\r\n\"That sum,\" he thought to himself, \"would tempt a man like him to do\r\nalmost anything to gain it.\" So he made the proffer. Billy heard the\r\nproposition gravely, and even feigned to view it favorably; but\r\nmanifested a great deal of curiosity as to why his ex-shipmate was in\r\nsuch demand.\r\n\r\nThe stranger felt that he had gone too far for any reticence to be of\r\nservice, now, and that perhaps a confidence might make him more secure\r\nof this valuable ally; so he replied: \"I'll tell you; but mind you're\r\nnot to say a word about it to any living soul until we have captured\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would I be likely to throw away a chance to make a hundred dollars?\"\r\nexclaimed Billy.\r\n\r\nThat answer, critically considered, could hardly have been deemed a\r\npromise; but the stranger took it for one, and continued in a\r\nconfidential tone:\r\n\r\n\"He's wanted for murder and robbery.\"\r\n\r\n\"Murder and robbery! Dorn Hackett?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the murder and robbery of an old man near Easthampton, Long\r\nIsland, where he has been going to see his sweetheart, a girl named\r\nMary Wallace.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you tell me that Dorn Hackett is suspected of a thing like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed, he is. He was in the neighborhood on the night of the\r\nmurder, and everything points to him; and I bet my head--\"\r\n\r\n\"That you are a lying, landlubberly--\" broke out Billy Prangle, in a\r\ntorrent of quite unreportable expletives, the unregenerate lingo of\r\nthe fo'cas'le; and before the stranger recovered from his\r\nastonishment, the indignant tar had commenced to make good that threat\r\nwith reference to his nose.\r\n\r\nMr. Turner--for the stranger, now rolling on the floor with Billy, was\r\nno other than that experienced professional detective--was a sturdy\r\nfellow, well able, ordinarily, to take care of himself, and made as\r\ngood a fight as he could; but even had he been entirely sober he would\r\nhardly have been able to cope with this sinewy son of the sea who\r\nsmote him so suddenly. While they struggled on the floor, Billy's\r\nfriends looked on with placid interest; interfering not, nor\r\nquestioning, and seemingly cheerfully confident of the result. The\r\nbarkeeper--Schoolcraft being away--seemed to enjoy the excitement, and\r\nleaned over the bar to get a better view, while he shouted\r\nencouragingly: \"Go in, Billy! Wade in, old man!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Billy followed the advice so well that it was not long until the\r\ndetective cried \"enough,\" and was allowed to get up; when Billy led\r\nhim to the door and dismissed him with a parting kick.\r\n\r\nSelf-reproachfully, and much humbled in spirit by his defeat, Richard\r\nTurner left the Haven. But it was not in his nature to give up a chase\r\nfor one defeat. If he had not genius, he at least had that which is\r\nsometimes almost as good--persistence. He did not even waste time in\r\nthinking about the whipping and the kicking he had received, but he\r\ndid reflect that it was something singular that a poor old chap like\r\nthat sailor should have thrown a chance away whereby he might have\r\ngained one hundred dollars so easily--merely by selling a friend,\r\nperhaps to the gallows. Would he, Richard Turner, have been so stupid?\r\n\"Hardly,\" he said to himself. But he had to accept facts as he found\r\nthem, however strange they might seem, and the two most prominent ones\r\nclaiming his attention were: first, that he had made a blunder;\r\nsecond, that he must work all the more rapidly to forestall the\r\npossible chances of his indiscretion leading to the escape of the man\r\nhe hunted. Fortunately, the whipping had sobered him completely; and\r\nhaving repaired as well as he could the damages he had sustained in\r\nperson and raiment, he continued until late at night, in other\r\nsailor's haunts, his pursuit of information, but took care to give a\r\nwide berth to the \"Whaler's Haven.\" Before daylight he left the place\r\nin a fast sloop and with a fair wind, bound for New Haven. There\r\nfickle fortune made him amends for her unkind humor at New London, and\r\nfacts that seemed to go far toward establishing Dorn Hackett's guilt\r\ncame readily to his knowledge. The most important were these:\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon preceding the murder of Jacob Van Deust the young man\r\nwent over to Long Island on Mr. Hollis's sloop. Nobody but himself\r\nknew why he went. The men on the sloop expected him to return to New\r\nHaven with them that night, but he did not do so. They left the Long\r\nIsland shore about the hour that it was supposed the murder was\r\nperpetrated and, presumably, before he could have run from Van Deusts'\r\nto the cove where the sloop laid. When he re-appeared in New Haven the\r\nnext morning his clothing was dabbled with blood; and his hands,\r\nthough he had evidently tried to wash them, still showed sanguinary\r\nstains. He said that the blood was his own; that he had a severe fall\r\nwhile running through the woods on Long Island. That he had fallen\r\nseemed probable, since he had a bad cut on his head and one ankle was\r\nlame; but that the blood was all his own, at least admitted of\r\nquestion. Why he had been running through the woods he did not say;\r\nbut it was natural to suppose that he had been trying to reach the\r\nsloop and get to New Haven as quickly as possible, to make ground for\r\nclaiming an alibi in case he should be suspected of the murder.\r\n\r\nThe other significant discoveries that the detective made, and what he\r\ndid in New Haven, will be noted in their proper place. Suffice it here\r\nto say, that the agent of justice felt that he had reason to\r\ncongratulate himself upon a triumph.\r\n\r\nBilly Prangle, when he had kicked out the tempter, lost no time in\r\nfully imparting to his comrades the excellent cause he had for his\r\nsuddenly violent conduct, and was heartily censured by all for not\r\nhammering the stranger twice as much.\r\n\r\n\"What?--Dorn Hackett guilty of murder and robbery?\"\r\n\r\nThey who had known him for years; sailed with him; messed with him;\r\nfaced death by his side in the tempest and the perilous chase of the\r\nmonsters of the deep, knew how absurd such a charge must be. Every man\r\nof them had belonged to the same crew with Dorn for three years, and\r\nthere was not one of them who did not groan to think that he had not\r\nhad Billy's chance at the stranger. In consultation among them, it was\r\nunanimously resolved that it was plainly their duty to take the matter\r\nin hand.\r\n\r\n\"Jerry Slate has got a fast little sloop,\" said Billy Prangle, \"that I\r\ncan borrow to take me over to Napeague. I'll go there and see that\r\ngirl of Dorn's that he spoke of--Mary Wallace, he called her. Here,\r\nyou barkeep', log that on a bit of paper for me, so that I won't let\r\nit go adrift. You, Sam, go down by Wainright's packet in the morning\r\nto New Haven, which it was the last place I heard of Dorn hailing\r\nfrom, and see that you find him and tell him all about it.\"\r\n\r\nThus the jolly tars arranged it among themselves to serve their friend\r\nas best they could. And so it was that, on the afternoon of the\r\nsucceeding day, a weather-beaten old sailor--Billy Prangle\r\nhimself--after various inquiries in the neighborhood, \"ranged\r\nalongside\" of Uncle Thatcher's house, asking for \"a gal by the name of\r\nMary Wallace.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\" demanded Aunt Thatcher, who happened to \"answer\r\nhis hail.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be you Mary Wallace?\" asked Billy, with an affectation of profound\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n\"No, I ain't. But I'm her aunt, and you can tell me your business.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right you are, old gal, I can; but I'll see you furder, first,\"\r\nreplied the unabashed veteran, who had already been told by some\r\nneighbor that she was a \"snorter.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, you impudent fellow?\"\r\n\r\n\"I always does my business with the principals, mum.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Thatcher slammed the door in his face and retired. But half an\r\nhour afterward, when she happened to be out in the yard, she saw that\r\nthe sailor had lighted his pipe, seated himself on the stone step at\r\nthe door, and literally laid siege to the house. She reflected that\r\nUncle Thatcher would soon be home to his supper; and in view of the\r\nstrange way he had acted of late, did not know how he might take it\r\ninto his head to look upon her treatment of the visitor. Tartar as she\r\nwas, she had a wholesome respect for him when he chose to assert\r\nhimself, and deemed it most prudent to avoid an encounter.\r\n\r\nWith an ill-grace she went to Mary, who was sewing in her room, and\r\nsaid snarlingly:\r\n\r\n\"There's an old vagabond at the door who wants to see you.\"\r\n\r\nMary went out and found Billy calmly puffing his pipe and waiting. He\r\nlooked up at the sound of the opening of the door, and seeing the tall\r\nhandsome girl who stood there, sprang to his feet, with a beaming\r\nsmile and outstretched hand, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Ah! You're the right one. I thought I'd fetch you.\"\r\n\r\nMary gave him her hand, smilingly asking:\r\n\r\n\"Did you wish to see me, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; the mate has been out here trying to rig the pump on me, but it\r\nwouldn't draw. What I'm here for concerns nobody but you and Dorn.\r\nCome out to the gate, for she's a listening beside that window. I just\r\nsee the curtain shake.\"\r\n\r\nMary started at mention of her lover's name by this stranger, and\r\nunhesitatingly accompanied him as he requested; while Aunt Thatcher,\r\nwho was indeed listening by the window, could almost have torn her\r\nsun-bonnet strings with vexation and rage when they passed beyond\r\nrange of her hearing.\r\n\r\nBilly, like many other maladroits, flattered himself that he had no\r\nlittle skill in conducting a delicate mission, and thought it was\r\nrather a neat way of sparing the girl's feelings to affect to be very\r\nbusy refilling his pipe, without looking at her, as he put the blunt\r\nquestion:\r\n\r\n\"Be you Dorn Hackett's sweetheart?\"\r\n\r\nMary blushed and stammered, not knowing what to reply.\r\n\r\n\"'Cause,\" continued Billy, \"he's maybe in some trouble.\"\r\n\r\nTrouble! Trouble for Dorn! That thought swept away in an instant her\r\ntimidity and maiden bashfulness, and anxiously she replied:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes; he is very dear to me. What is it? What has happened to\r\nhim? Tell me quickly!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't get excited. It ain't no great matter. But they are looking for\r\nhim to arrest him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Arrest Dorn? For what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Murder and robbery.\"\r\n\r\nMary gave a little cry and would have fallen, had not Billy caught\r\nher; and holding her against the fence, awkwardly enough, but firmly,\r\nadjured her:\r\n\r\n\"Steady, steady! Brace up! Hold hard!\"\r\n\r\nIn a few moments she regained sufficient control over herself to\r\nlisten while the old sailor related to her, with characteristic\r\ncircumstantiality of detail, all the events of the preceding evening\r\nleading up to his visit to her. She did not for an instant imagine\r\nthat Dorn could possibly have been guilty of such crimes, but the mere\r\nidea of his being suspected of them so horrified her as almost to\r\ndeprive her of the power of reasoning. How could he have fallen under\r\nsuspicion? How could it come to be known that he was in the\r\nneighborhood on that fatal night? There was but one person, she\r\nbelieved, besides herself who knew of his visit, and that was Ruth\r\nLenox. Ah, yes! There was her aunt, who suspected it at least, and who\r\nhad questioned her so sharply about him. Ruth Lenox would never have\r\nbreathed such a foul calumny against Dorn. But her aunt? \"Yes, it\r\nwould be just like her,\" thought Mary.\r\n\r\nBilly had no further information to impart, no advice to give, and no\r\nconsolations to offer. The latter would have been especially out of\r\nhis line. It seemed to him enough to give a person warning to look out\r\nfor him or herself, as the case might be; which, he reasoned, would be\r\nall he would require under any circumstances; and so, having\r\ndischarged his errand to the best of his ability in the manner we have\r\nseen, he relighted his pipe and \"got under way,\" with a clear\r\nconscience as to having done his duty by a shipmate.\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\nAND THE TROUBLE BEGINS.\r\n\r\nRuth Lenox was, just at this time, on a brief visit to the house of a\r\nmarried brother, who lived near Babylon; so that Mary was not able to\r\nconsult with her only confidante until the second day after Billy\r\nPrangle's visit. Who could tell the agony of mind she felt during that\r\ntime as the leaden hours dragged slowly by? It seemed to her fearful\r\nand excited imagination as if at any moment she was liable to hear of\r\nher lover's capture and imprisonment, and she was powerless to do\r\naught to save him. One hope only suggested itself to her mind: that he\r\nmight have sailed away from New Haven before his pursuers could reach\r\nhim, and that by the time of his return from the West Indies the real\r\nmurderer might be discovered, and the foul suspicion against Dorn\r\nentirely dissipated. But she was not left to cherish in peace even\r\nthat small germ of comfort, for Aunt Thatcher, with the astuteness and\r\nmalice of a feminine fiend--and if there is a distinction of sex among\r\nthe devils, the female ones must surely be far the worst--divined that\r\nthe sailor who visited Mary had come from Dorn, or in his interest,\r\nand embittered every hour of the poor girl's life by the wagging of\r\nher venomous tongue. As soon as Billy had gone away she demanded to\r\nknow what his business was; and receiving no reply--for Mary felt that\r\nshe would rather have died than give her aunt the satisfaction of\r\nknowing the hideous intelligence he brought--proceeded to treat the\r\nsubject in her own lively fashion.\r\n\r\n\"Oho! So you don't want to tell! Well, I don't wonder at it. I'd be\r\nashamed, too, if I was in your place. But I can guess without your\r\ntelling me. It's some word from Dorn Hackett, I'll be bound. Wants you\r\nto go and take up with him while he's in port, maybe. If you do, you\r\nneedn't think to come back here with your disgrace. I s'pose he thinks\r\nhe's got a heap of money now. Did he let you know how much he got by\r\nkilling old Jake Van Deust?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, aunt!\" exclaimed Mary. \"You know that is a wicked falsehood! You\r\nknow Dorn never would have done such a thing!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't tell me I lie, you impudent, deceitful, good-for-nothing hussy!\r\nDon't you dare to talk back to me! I know what I know! Oh, I'll have\r\nthe satisfaction of seeing him hanged yet!\"\r\n\r\nMary burst into tears and left the house. That bit of dialogue was a\r\nsample of what the heart-sick miserable girl had to endure constantly\r\nwhen Uncle Thatcher was not present. When he was by, the vixen did\r\nnot dare to torment her victim, and Mary might have had a stop put to\r\nthe woman's malignant attacks had she appealed to him; but from that\r\nextreme measure she revolted.\r\n\r\nWhen Ruth returned home Mary hastened to her with her load of\r\ntroubles, and was not disappointed in her expectation of sympathy and\r\nconsolation.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you be afraid, dear,\" said little Ruth, in a very confident and\r\nprotecting tone. \"It will be all right. You'll see that it will. I'll\r\nmake Lem fix it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lem?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. He shall go and find out who did kill Mr. Van Deust, and then\r\nI'm sure there can't be any more talk about Dorn. And I know, just as\r\nwell as anything, that it was all started by that spiteful, wicked old\r\naunt of yours. Lem told me, the night before I went away, that he saw\r\nher go into the Squire's office the evening of the inquest, after\r\neverybody else was gone but a strange man, and she stayed a long time;\r\nand I'd just risk my neck on it that that was the time she put him up\r\nto the notion of Dorn doing it. And I think he might have had more\r\nsense--a man like him, who has known him from he was a boy, and no\r\nstranger to what she is. But don't be afraid, dear. I'll start Lem\r\nright out to catch the real murderer, and I'll tell him I won't marry\r\nhim until he finds him; and that'll bring him to his senses, I guess,\r\nfor he's getting in an awful hurry about it.\"\r\n\r\nRuth was very earnest and emphatic, and her friend understood and was\r\ncomforted by her, although it was not always easy to comprehend the\r\nbreathless torrent of words that the energetic little maid poured\r\nforth, with reckless disregard alike of punctuation and of pronouns,\r\nwhen she became excited, as she now was.\r\n\r\nLem was very reluctant to undertake the task that Ruth sought to\r\nimpose upon him.\r\n\r\n\"It ain't my business,\" he protested, \"and I don't know anything about\r\nit. I wouldn't even know how to begin. How would I look going around\r\nthe country asking people, 'who killed Jake Van Deust?' And I swon I\r\ndon't know any other way to tackle the job. Squire Bodley told me he's\r\ngot a real sharp fellow from New York at work--a chap that makes a\r\nbusiness of catching thieves and murderers, and knows all about it.\r\nAnd I might do no end of mischief if I went to meddling.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now don't talk to me that way, Lem Pawlett. I won't have it. You've\r\ngot a heap more sense than you give yourself credit for, and more than\r\nmost people would think, to look at you, I must say. Wasn't it you\r\nthat found the marks on the window, and tracked the murderer out to\r\nthe lane? Of course it was. None of them gawks standing around saw\r\nanything until you showed it to them. And as for that smart chap from\r\nNew York--why, he's the very one that went and bleated out his\r\nbusiness to a lot of sailors in New London,--Dorn's friends all of\r\nthem,--and they thrashed him, and served him right, too. And that's\r\nhow we come to know about his being after Dorn, which, if he had any\r\nsense, he wouldn't be. And you've got to find some way to clear Dorn\r\nfor Mary's sake, or I'll never forgive you, and I won't marry you\r\nuntil Dorn and Mary can stand up with us, and--so there, now.\"\r\n\r\nLem started home that evening, after his interview with Ruth, in a\r\nvery despondent mood, and at a much earlier hour than usual, almost\r\ninclined to rebel against her authority, yet feeling that he must\r\neventually succumb to her will. As he strolled moodily down the\r\nvillage street, wondering \"what on earth\" he should do, and thinking,\r\nas he subsequently confessed, that perhaps it might be as well to\r\namuse Ruth by letting her imagine him very busy in Dorn's affairs,\r\nwhile he simply left matters to take their own course, confiding in\r\nDorn coming out all right somehow, at last, his attention was\r\nattracted to the presence of an unwonted number of persons in the\r\nprincipal store, and the prevalence among them of some unusual\r\nexcitement. Entering to learn what was going on he was just in time\r\nto hear the mail-rider, who had arrived but a little before, conclude\r\na sentence with the words \"and so he's in Sag Harbor jail already.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's in jail?\" Lem demanded, with a sinking at the heart, for he\r\nwell knew that no idle putting off would do for Ruth if her friend's\r\nlover were really locked up.\r\n\r\n\"Dorn Hackett,\" replied the mail-rider, proud of his news, and glad to\r\nhave the opportunity of repetition to a new auditor,--\"for the murder\r\nand robbery of Jacob Van Deust.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" exclaimed Lem.\r\n\r\n\"It's so, I tell you. They caught him in New Haven last night. If\r\nthey'd missed him until to-day, he'd have been off for the West\r\nIndies; but a New York officer, who got on his track in New London,\r\ncaught him. And they say he fought like a tiger. Both the officer's\r\neyes are blacked; but one of 'em is a little staler color than the\r\nother, and I guess he must have been in two musses lately. Anyhow, he\r\nhad two New Haven constables to help him to put handcuffs on Dorn, and\r\nthen they brought him over in a sloop; and so he's in Sag Harbor jail\r\nalready.\"\r\n\r\n\"Him that sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed. The\r\nLord wouldn't let him escape,\" snuffled Deacon Harkins from his perch\r\non the sugar barrel.\r\n\r\n\"That's what comes of young men leaving their homes where they were\r\nbrought up, and going off to the big cities to make their fortunes and\r\nget into evil ways,\" sagely observed the store-keeper, reflectively,\r\nchipping off a bit of cheese for himself.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\" \"That's so.\" \"Just what a body might have expected,\" murmured\r\nseveral voices.\r\n\r\n\"How do they know he did it?\" asked Lem, in an aggressive tone,\r\nresenting the willing acceptance of Dorn's probable guilt, which was\r\nmanifestly the disposition of the group about him.\r\n\r\n\"Ain't he arrested? What more d'ye want?\" retorted Deacon Harkins.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! That's reason enough for you, is it? That's the sort of a\r\nChristian you are! Condemn a man before he's tried! Hang him on\r\nsuspicion! As if the law never got hold of the wrong person! Well, I\r\ndon't believe Dorn Hackett was the chap that ever would have done such\r\na deed, and I don't care if he was arrested a hundred times, I'd bet\r\nmy life no jury but a jury of Deacon Harkins's would ever find him\r\nguilty.\"\r\n\r\n\"There goes another young man I don't never expect any good of,\"\r\nremarked Deacon Harkins, in a self-satisfied tone, as though his\r\ncondemnation quite settled the here and the hereafter of Lem Pawlett,\r\nas that young man, having \"said his say,\" strode out angrily, and went\r\non his way.\r\n\r\nBut Lem heard him not, and would have cared little if he had, for just\r\nthen his mind was busy with a new and firm resolve.\r\n\r\n\"I'll do it,\" he muttered to himself, \"to spite that consarned old\r\ndeacon, who never was known to have a good word for anybody, as much\r\nas to please Ruth! I'll save Dorn Hackett; by the great horn spoon, I\r\nwill!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\nLEM OPENS THE CAMPAIGN.\r\n\r\nDorn Hackett sat moodily upon his low bed in a little cell of Sag\r\nHarbor jail. His elbows rested upon his knees, and his aching brow was\r\nsupported by his palms pressed against his temples. He might, had he\r\nwished to do so, have caught a glimpse of sunshine through the narrow\r\nwindow high up in the wall; might have seen the green branches of the\r\nvenerable elm that, swayed by the wind, swept its foliage from time to\r\ntime across that little space of sky; might have heard the blithe\r\ncarols of the song-birds that flitted among the old tree's boughs, and\r\neven perched and sang upon the stone window ledge; but he had no heart\r\nto look anywhere but on the ground; no thought for aught but his own\r\nmisery and shame. It seemed to him a terrible thing that he should be\r\nlocked in a jail. What would Mary say when she learned of it, as she\r\ninevitably must? Ah! She would not believe that he could be guilty,\r\ncertainly not; but the shame of him would break her heart.\r\n\r\nHis life had hitherto been one singularly free from reproach, and of\r\nthe many things to which even passably good men become accustomed and\r\nhardened, by contact with the world, he was almost as innocent as his\r\nsweetheart herself. He had not gone off to a big city to make his\r\nfortune and fall into evil ways, as the Easthampton storekeeper had\r\nsaid. Out of the three years and some months since he quitted the\r\nvillage, he had spent, altogether, but a few weeks on shore. He had\r\nbeen out at sea, doing bravely and well the manly work to which he had\r\ndedicated himself, and from even the ruder and, to some natures,\r\ndemoralizing influences by which he was there surrounded, he had been\r\nprotected by the purifying charm of his ever-faithful love. A\r\nretrospective view of his whole life brought to his memory no thought\r\nof regret or shame for aught that he had done, no remembrance of\r\nanything he would have wished to hide from the knowledge of her he\r\nloved best, and in whose regard he had most desire to stand well.\r\n\r\nBut there was one thing that, were it to do over again, he would not\r\nhave repeated. He would not have knocked down the officer who came to\r\narrest him, as he did in his first natural heat of indignation at\r\nhearing himself charged with being an assassin and a thief. No, he\r\nwould not do that over again, for after he was ironed he had heard men\r\nsay that he did it in a desperate hope of escape, and that he would\r\nnot have done it if he had not been guilty. And yet it seemed to him\r\nthe most natural thing for an innocent man to do under the\r\ncircumstances. Could he have imagined that such a construction would\r\nbe put upon it? And now what had he to look forward to? He knew\r\nnothing, absolutely, of the murder, of the inquest, or of the grounds\r\nupon which he was suspected, save that he had a vague remembrance of\r\nhearing it said, amid the excitement attendant upon his arrest, that\r\nhe had been in the vicinity of where Mr. Van Deust was murdered, on\r\nthe night that the old man was killed. Yes, that was probably true;\r\nand how could he prove, or even state, the innocent purpose of his\r\npresence there. Could he ask Mary to come into court and testify to\r\ntheir love-meeting in the woods? No. Not even to save his life.\r\n\r\nHis reflections were broken by the sound of footsteps in the corridor\r\nwithout, and the sound of the jailor's voice saying:\r\n\r\n\"This is his cell.\"\r\n\r\nThe prisoner looked up and met the frank, kindly face and outstretched\r\nhand of Lem Pawlett.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Dorn, old fellow, I'm mightily sorry to see you here,\" he said\r\ncordially, as the jailor walked away, leaving him standing in front of\r\nthe grated iron door of the cell, through which his hand was thrust to\r\ngrasp that of Mary's lover.\r\n\r\n\"Does--do they know of it?\" stammered Dorn.\r\n\r\n\"Does Mary, you mean. Well, yes, I guess she does. Uncle Thatcher was\r\nat the store last night when the mail-rider brought the news, and he\r\nhas most probably mentioned it at home. But, Lord bless you man! she\r\ndon't think anything of it. Cheer up. Don't get down in the mouth. She\r\nwon't believe a word against you, you may be sure. And it don't come\r\non her like a shock, as it were, because she has been expecting it.\"\r\n\r\n\"She expected it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. She has known for two or three days that they were after you,\r\nbut had no way of getting any word to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how did they come to be after me?\"\r\n\r\n\"That was Aunt Thatcher's doings, I believe; but I'll tell you all\r\nabout it, as far as I know.\"\r\n\r\nThereupon the good fellow proceeded to give as full and correct an\r\naccount, as his information enabled, of the facts already better known\r\nto the reader, beginning his narrative with the discovery of the\r\nmurder and concluding it with an expression of his determination of\r\nthe night before, to \"try to straighten out the tangle.\"\r\n\r\n\"God bless you, old fellow,\" responded Dorn, with tears of gratitude\r\nin his eyes. \"I can't tell you how it warms my heart to have one\r\nfriend stand by me in a time like this. But little did I ever think,\r\nwhen we were boys playing together, that you would ever have to do\r\nsuch a thing for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right, Dorn. Don't say any more about it. I'll be glad if\r\nI can do anything, and so will Ruth and Mary. And now, let's see what\r\nis to be done. The first thing is for you to tell me, as clearly and\r\nexactly as you can, every incident you can remember of where you were\r\nand what you did that night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything is as clear in my mind as the occurrences of yesterday.\r\nLet me begin at the beginning. I reached New Haven in the forenoon of\r\nthat day, and, having made a much quicker voyage than was expected,\r\nfound that I would have several days at my disposal. Of course my\r\nfirst thought was of going to see Mary. I left the schooner in charge\r\nof the mate, to see to the taking out of her cargo while I was gone,\r\nand got a man named Hollis to bring me over to Napeague in a little\r\nfishing smack. He had to come, any way, to get a couple of pipes of\r\nrum that had rolled off a trader's deck one night. I left him at the\r\nbeach, telling him that if I did not meet him there at half past nine\r\no'clock that evening he need not wait for me, as I might have to\r\nremain over a day, or even two; for you know, as Mary would not be\r\nexpecting me, I did not know whether I should meet her at the usual\r\nplace that evening or not, and I couldn't go to her uncle's to see\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I know all about that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I was fortunate enough to meet her, walking with Ruth, and\r\nnaturally remained with her as long as I could. It was nine o'clock,\r\nas near as I could judge by the rise of the moon, when we parted, and\r\nI set out for the beach to meet Hollis. I was a little afraid of being\r\nlate, and took a short cut through the woods that I thought I knew\r\njust as well as when we used to go huckleberrying in them when we were\r\nboys. But there had been at least one change that I knew nothing of--a\r\nnew road.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes. The new one across from Amagansett.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose so. Whatever it is, I found it very suddenly. I was running\r\nat the time, along a little path that I knew well, and all at once\r\nwent plunging down, head foremost, nine or ten feet into a cut. It's a\r\nwonder--and, as I then thought, a mercy--that I didn't break my neck.\r\nLately I've had my doubts as to whether it wouldn't have been better\r\nfor me if I had.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stow that, and pay out your yarn.\"\r\n\r\n\"When I could collect my scattered senses, I found that I had cut two\r\nugly gashes in my head, upon sharp pointed roots or stubs of some\r\nsort, and had sprained my left ankle so that it was exceedingly\r\npainful for me to attempt to walk. While I sat there, thinking what I\r\nshould do, a little elderly gentleman, on horseback, came along upon\r\nthe new road into which I had fallen. I told him I was hurt, and he\r\nvery kindly assisted me, first to fix up my head--giving me his\r\nhandkerchief to use with my own for the purpose,--and then to get over\r\nto the beach. Hollis was gone. The accident had delayed me far beyond\r\nmy time, and he, of course, supposed that I was not coming. When I got\r\nmy ankle in the cool sea-water it felt better, but still I could not\r\nwalk any distance on it. Just then a small smack came along, with an\r\nold man and a boy in it--strangers to me--probably out on some\r\nsmuggling errand, and I offered the old man ten dollars to take me\r\nover to New Haven, which he accepted gladly. The kind little gentleman\r\nhelped me into the boat and bade me good-night, saying that he had yet\r\nto ride to Sag Harbor. We had very little wind, and it was daylight\r\nwhen the old man landed me in New Haven. I had lost a good deal of\r\nblood from the cuts on my head, and felt half sick and drowsy from it,\r\nso that I slept nearly all the time I was in the boat. And that's all\r\nI can tell you about that night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, man alive, that's enough. All we've got to do is to find the\r\nlittle gentleman and the old man to prove that you left the island\r\nbefore eleven o'clock, for it was after that hour that Jacob Van Deust\r\nwas murdered. That will show clearly enough that whoever did kill him,\r\nat all events, you didn't; and that's all we care about just at\r\npresent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! If I had the slightest idea of who they were. But I never thought\r\nto ask their names, and indeed didn't take much notice of anything;\r\nfor, as I said, I was dizzy, and half-sick, and drowsy, with the loss\r\nof blood; so that even if they had told me who they were, I don't know\r\nthat I should have been able to remember. If the old man was, as I\r\nsuppose, a smuggler, he would hardly be likely to willingly expose\r\nhimself to inconvenient questioning in court. Old men are cautious\r\nabout taking such chances, especially for people who are nothing to\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you give me a description of the little gentleman on horseback?\r\nor tell me anything about him that might lead to his identification?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Only I remember he said he was a stranger, and knew nobody in the\r\nneighborhood except the Van Deusts. The way he came to mention that\r\nwas in talking of taking me somewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, as he mentioned the Van Deusts, old Peter doubtless knows who\r\nhe is. Ah! Come to think about it, he said at the inquest that his\r\nlawyer from New York had called on him that evening. Why, it's all\r\nplain sailing now. I'll go to the old man right away and ask him, and\r\nhe'll tell me who his lawyer is, and I'll go and see him, and we'll\r\nhave you out in a jiffy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lem, I can't tell you how I appreciate your kindness and the trouble\r\nyou are taking in my behalf.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't try to. It's all right, I tell you. You'd do the same for me; I\r\nknow you would. And I rather think I begin to like the job, knowing\r\nhow it will spite that old cuss, Deacon Harkins.\"\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the young men's chat at the cell door had no especial\r\nsignificance or bearing upon the progress of the events of our story,\r\nand may as well, therefore, be omitted. Suffice it to say, that when\r\nthey separated, Dorn felt infinitely more hopeful and cheerful than\r\nhe had before since his arrest, and Lem had far greater confidence in\r\nthe result of his novel undertaking of detective work. Of course Lem\r\ncarried away with him many loving messages to Mary, which were, in due\r\ntime, faithfully delivered through Ruth.\r\n\r\nIt was too late that evening when the young man reached his home for\r\nhim to call upon Peter Van Deust, but he went up to the homestead\r\nunder the elms the next morning, at as early an hour as he dared hoped\r\nto find anybody astir. He found the lonely old man, already seated\r\nupon the long bench on the porch, in his accustomed place, with his\r\npipe in his mouth, and his gaze turned toward the sea; but the pipe\r\nhad gone out unnoticed, and the eyes saw nothing of the glory of the\r\ndawn upon the ocean, for they were blinded by tears that unconsciously\r\nfilled them. Lem stood silently looking at him for some moments,\r\nhesitating to speak, and hoping to be noticed; but the old man did not\r\nseem to know that he was not alone, until Lem's voice, bidding him\r\n\"Good-morning,\" awoke him with a start from his reverie. Then the\r\nstart, with which he had been recalled, extended itself in a long fit\r\nof nervous trembling, and it was with a weak and quavering voice that\r\nhe responded to his visitor's salutation. It was painful to see how\r\nthe unhappy man had broken down in the little time that had passed\r\nsince the death of his brother. It seemed to have added at least ten\r\nyears to his age.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose, Mr. Van Deust, that you have heard of Dorn Hackett's\r\narrest,\" began the young man, after a failure to find any other way\r\nthan a direct plunge to arrive at his subject.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, I was told of it yesterday. Dorn Hackett? Dorn Hackett?\r\nThey say he used to live around here, but I don't remember him. I\r\nsuppose I used to know him, though. And he was raised in the\r\nneighborhood? It seems strange that any one who was raised near him,\r\nand knew him, could ever have had the heart to kill Jacob, don't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Mr. Van Deust, maybe he didn't do it at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Somebody did it; somebody climbed into his window and murdered him\r\nfor the sake of a little money. Beat in his skull and cut short his\r\nlittle remnant of life, just to get a few dollars. Oh! it was a cruel\r\nthing to do, to kill that poor, harmless, gentle, good old man. I wish\r\nwe had never heard of that cursed fortune. Jacob would be alive\r\nto-day, if we hadn't.\"\r\n\r\nHis agitation while he spoke was extreme. He trembled like a leaf in\r\nthe wind; tears ran down his withered cheeks; his voice was broken by\r\nsobs, and at length his emotion so obstructed his utterance that Lem\r\ncould not understand him as he went rambling on about his brother's\r\nuntimely end. After a little time, during which Lem silently waited\r\nfor him to regain a little calm, his mood seemed to change to one of\r\nsuspicion and fear for himself.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose they'll come to kill me next,\" he exclaimed. \"They'll think\r\nthere's more money; but there isn't--there isn't a dollar in the\r\nhouse. I'll never have a dollar in the house again; and I'll get a\r\ndog, a savage big dog, and I'll load the gun. Oh, I've got a gun,\r\nthough it hasn't been loaded in forty years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Van Deust, a little elderly gentleman on horseback was in this\r\nneighborhood the night your brother was murdered, and he said he knew\r\nyou. Who was he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, he's my lawyer, the man who brought us the intelligence of--But\r\nwhat do you want to know for? What right have you to come here asking\r\nme questions about my private affairs--about my lawyer? Do you think\r\nhe brings money here? No, he don't! he don't! there isn't a dollar in\r\nthe house. It's none of your business! Go away from here. I won't\r\nanswer any more of your questions. I was a fool to tell you so much!\r\nBegone! begone! Betsy! Betsy! Help! help!\"\r\n\r\nThe old man's excitement seemed to have crazed him, temporarily, at\r\nleast. He continued raving, and Lem, finding it impossible to get in a\r\nword of explanation, went away, no little disgusted with the rebuff he\r\nhad encountered at the very commencement of his task of hunting up an\r\n_alibi_ for Dorn. Returning to Sag Harbor, he succeeded in finding the\r\nman who had hired a horse to the little elderly gentleman on several\r\noccasions, but could learn nothing from him beyond that fact. The\r\ngentleman, according to the man's statement, always arrived by boat\r\nfrom New York, got the horse, rode away, came back, paid, and\r\ndisappeared, probably by boat again. And that was all that the owner\r\nof the horse knew about him.\r\n\r\nThen Lem went to New York, saying to himself that he \"would ask every\r\nlittle elderly lawyer in New York if he was the man,\" before he would\r\ngive up the pursuit. Little did the unsophisticated young fellow, who\r\nhad never before been away from home, imagine the magnitude of the job\r\nhe had cut out for himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.\r\n\r\nLOVE THAT IS NOT ASHAMED.\r\n\r\nThe closing of the inquest upon the body of Jacob Van Deust was a mere\r\nformality. It was generally understood that there was within reach, if\r\nnot in actual possession, some evidence that would go far to connect\r\nDorn Hackett with the crime, and Squire Bodley even hinted as much in\r\na few remarks that he made to the jury; but it was deemed injudicious\r\nto make it known at this juncture, and the jury, by the Squire's\r\ndirection, returned a verdict of \"death by violence at the hands of\r\nsome person unknown.\"\r\n\r\nMary Wallace, ignorant of the slow, serpentine, and deadly ways of the\r\nthing men amuse themselves by calling \"justice,\" when the finding of\r\nthe jury was told to her that night found it difficult to understand\r\nwhy Dorn should be kept in jail, when there seemed to be no evidence\r\nwhich the coroner's jury has found sufficient to connect him with the\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle,\" said she, timidly approaching grim Mr. Thatcher, as he sat on\r\nthe stone door-step, surrounded by a litter of fine shavings that he\r\nhad scraped from a whale-lance handle that he was finishing by the\r\nlast light of day, \"why is it that, if the jury gave their verdict\r\nthat the murder was done by some unknown person, they don't let Mr.\r\nHackett out of jail?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever see a cat playing with a live mouse that she had\r\ncaught?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, uncle.\"\r\n\r\n\"How she lets it go a little way off, making it think it is going to\r\nescape, and then pounces on it again? How she pretends she isn't\r\npaying any attention to it, and has no notion of hurting it, and then\r\nsuddenly tears it to pieces?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, uncle,\" repeated Mary with a shudder.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's the way the law does with a man.\"\r\n\r\nMary covered her face with her hands, and wept softly, while he went\r\non:\r\n\r\n\"If they still hold on to Dorn Hackett, it is because they hope to get\r\nproof enough against him to make him out guilty. I have heard lawyers\r\nsay that the law presumes every man to be innocent until he is proved\r\nguilty; and when I was a younger man, I actually believed that; but as\r\nI have got older, I have learned that practically, in the\r\nadministration of the law, when a crime is committed somebody has got\r\nto suffer for it, for the sake of the moral effect on the community;\r\nand it don't really make much difference who it is, so long as the\r\npoor devil who is caught cannot prove himself innocent, which is\r\nsometimes a mighty hard thing to do. He may not be guilty, but they\r\nwill try to make him out so. Better hang him than admit having made a\r\nblunder in his arrest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but uncle! you don't believe Dorn could be guilty, do you?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at her pale anxious face with a feeling of deep pity,--for\r\nhis eyes were keen enough to see that it was of her lover she\r\nspoke,--and replied with unwonted tenderness:\r\n\r\n\"No, my poor child. No, I don't; and I wouldn't if I knew nothing more\r\nabout him than your trust in him.\"\r\n\r\nTwo low sounds mingled softly, and were doubtless duly noted by the\r\nrecording angel on duty: a sigh from Uncle Thatcher, and a sniff of\r\ndisgust from his lean and rancorous wife in the dark room behind him.\r\nHe sighed to think, as he looked at Mary, and appreciated the worth of\r\nher full and perfect love, what a treasure his profligate son had lost\r\nin her, among all the good he had recklessly cast from him. Aunt\r\nThatcher sniffed because she did not dare to express openly her\r\ncontempt for his weakness in manifesting sympathy for the poor orphan\r\nwho had won her hearty and unextinguishable hatred by rejection of\r\nSilas's advances.\r\n\r\n\"And if Dorn cannot, as you say it is difficult to do, prove himself\r\ninnocent, what will they do with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"They'll hang him,\" exclaimed Aunt Thatcher, in a tone of malicious\r\ntriumph, unable longer to contain herself, and now appearing in the\r\ndoor to enjoy Mary's horror.\r\n\r\nUncle Thatcher turned upon her with a look of disgust and retorted:\r\n\r\n\"Sallie Thatcher, if the devil himself ain't ashamed of you, he's\r\nmeaner than I take him for.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, indeed! I'm so bad, am I? Thank you, Mr. Thatcher. Just because I\r\ndon't choose to take up for a murderer and a thief. I'm sure any body\r\nmight have known what he'd come to when he commenced by nearly killing\r\nmy poor boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your 'poor boy' deserved all he got, and more, too; and I've good\r\nreasons of my own for thinking that we'll both see the day we'll have\r\nto regret that Dorn Hackett didn't finish him then.\"\r\n\r\nAunt Thatcher's surprise and rage at hearing those words deprived her\r\nfor a moment of the power of articulation, and she could only give\r\nvent to her feelings by a sort of wild beast howl of fury. But very\r\nsoon her ready tongue loosened itself again, and she poured forth a\r\ntorrent of reproach, vituperation, and malediction directed at random\r\nagainst her husband, against Mary, against Dorn, against the world,\r\nindeed, excepting only her \"poor injured boy.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Uncle Thatcher had had enough of this, he straightened himself up\r\nbefore her, and she, as if fearing the weight of his heavy hand,\r\nretreated into the dark room. But he did not seem to have any\r\nintention of personal violence. He simply pulled the door to, locked\r\nit on the outside, and sat down again. A moment afterward the door was\r\ntried and rattled from the inside.\r\n\r\n\"Stay in there and keep quiet, if you know what's good for you,\"\r\ngrowled Uncle Thatcher.\r\n\r\nThe rattling ceased, and all was again quiet.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle,\" said Mary, after a little pause, \"I want to go and see Dorn.\"\r\n\r\n\"In jail?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he replied, a little doubtfully, \"people might talk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let them, if they will. I don't care--or, at least, I don't care\r\nenough to prevent my going to him when he is in trouble. What can they\r\nsay, but that we are lovers. Well, yes, we are, and it is no time for\r\nme to seek to hide it when others look coldly and cruelly on him. He\r\nloves me--I know he does; and I love him--with all my heart. And we\r\nwere going to be married very soon, uncle. I would have told you\r\nbefore, but I was afraid. Now you are so kind to me that I'm not\r\nafraid to tell you any more. And oh, Uncle, I _must_ go to him!\"\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me, little Mary--and may God forgive me for having made poor\r\nLottie's orphan child afraid to put confidence in me. You say you want\r\nto go and see him. You shall. I'll hitch up early to-morrow morning\r\nand take you over to Sag Harbor myself.\"\r\n\r\nLong before daylight the next morning Mary, who had not closed her\r\neyes during the seemingly interminable night, was up and had breakfast\r\nprepared. Whether Aunt Thatcher was still under the influence of the\r\nsullen fury that possessed her when the door was closed upon her the\r\nnight before, or had fresh fuel added to the fire of her temper by\r\noverhearing the arrangement between her husband and niece, did not\r\nappear. At all events she spoke no word of question or remark, and was\r\nstill abed when they took their departure.\r\n\r\nThe sun was not risen above the sea when Uncle Thatcher's old carryall\r\ncreaked through the one long rambling street of the little village,\r\nand entered upon the Sag Harbor road; but his upward glinting beams\r\nalready spread with gold and crimson the lower edges of the fleecy\r\nclouds on the eastern horizon. Diamonds of dew still clung to the long\r\ngrass blades, and the points of the forest leaves and the morning\r\nbreeze, heavy with the salt smell of the sea, was fresh and bracing.\r\nRobins flitted across the road with sharp notes, as of query why folks\r\nshould be abroad so early, and a belated rabbit, homeward bound to his\r\nburrow in the brush, sat up-reared upon his haunches and seemed\r\nparalyzed by astonishment until the horses were almost upon him, when\r\nhe bounded swiftly away. Higher and higher rose the sun, and as his\r\nardent rays licked up the dew, light clouds of yellow dust swirled and\r\nspread behind the rapidly-moving wheels. Past orchards, where red\r\nwinter apples glowed in the sunshine like balls of blood amid the\r\nfoliage of the trees; past fields still golden with the stubble of the\r\nearly ripened grain; past fallow lands, where the blue-bird carolled\r\ngayly on the hollow stump in which he and his mate had reared their\r\nspringtime brood; past leafy woods, where nuts were ripening, the\r\nwheels rolled fast until they reached the quaint old town--their\r\njourney's end--and halted beneath the old-time tavern's venerable\r\nelms.\r\n\r\nLeaving the horses hitched, after having carefully watered them, Uncle\r\nThatcher accompanied his niece to the jail and asked permission for\r\nher to see Dorn Hackett, which the jailor, having no orders to the\r\ncontrary, readily accorded. Mr. Thatcher did not enter. Though far\r\nfrom being a nervous man, he felt as if the close clammy atmosphere of\r\nthat stone warehouse of sin and sorrow sent a chill to his heart.\r\nBesides, he had no business with Dorn Hackett. With a great breath of\r\nrelief he turned his back upon the jail and wandered off down to the\r\nwharf to look at the shipping--for Sag Harbor had shipping in those\r\ndays--to learn if there was any change in the oil and whalebone\r\nmarkets, and perhaps to ascertain what was coming to his share of that\r\nschooner in which he was part owner.\r\n\r\nDorn was just bidding adieu to his lawyer, when Mary appeared in the\r\ncorridor.\r\n\r\n\"By jove! Here's a pretty girl come to see some prisoner!\" exclaimed\r\nthe lawyer at sight of her.\r\n\r\nDorn paid no attention to the remark. There was but one pretty girl in\r\nthe world about whom he cared to think, and he did not expect her to\r\ncome there. What, then, was his surprise when, the lawyer having\r\nstepped aside to give place to the visitor at his cell-door, he looked\r\nout and beheld the beautiful face of his own true-love, Mary. With a\r\ncry of surprise and joy he thrust his arms through between the bars,\r\ncatching her in an embrace, and their lips met in a long and ardent\r\nkiss. The lawyer, who was a young man, and possessed of a very lively\r\nappreciation of feminine beauty, lingered a few moments and then\r\nquietly took his departure.\r\n\r\n\"I hardly know whether I am most glad or ashamed to see you here,\r\ndarling,\" said Dorn, looking tenderly at his beloved.\r\n\r\n\"Glad, I hope, dearest. Should you feel ashamed of being unfortunate?\r\nIt is only guilt of which one need be ashamed; and that, I well know,\r\nmy dear Dorn has not.\"\r\n\r\n\"True. But it is very hard to wash the prison taint off, even from an\r\ninnocent man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not think so, my love. Everybody will know yet how true and good\r\nyou are, and will be all the kinder to you for the mistake that has\r\ngiven us so much pain and trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, my dear girl, it is your love and not your reason that tells me\r\nso. Even people who have no other reason for hating the man who has\r\nbeen the victim of such a mistake, will find sufficient the\r\nconsciousness that they have erred in supposing him guilty, and will\r\nalways profess to view him with suspicion, whether they feel it or\r\nnot. There is nothing that people generally abhor so much as a\r\nconfession of fallibility. But, no matter. I have your love and\r\nconfidence, dear Mary; I'm sure I have, or you would not be here; and\r\nfor all beyond that I'd ask small odds from the world if I were free\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you will be, dearest, I am sure of it. It can never be possible\r\nthat a man should be punished by law for that of which he is not\r\nguilty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you think so? Then you have not read much about people who have\r\nbeen convicted upon circumstantial evidence. I have read a whole book\r\nabout such cases, and I tell you it takes very little real proof to\r\nhang a man sometimes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Dorn! Don't talk so! You make me wild with horror and fear!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there,--there,--darling. I won't say any more about it. I\r\nshouldn't have said so much, but somehow I have got into a bad way of\r\ntalking back since I have had to make the acquaintance of a lawyer.\"\r\n\r\nAnd kissing her tenderly, he sought to remove the terror that he had\r\nunthinkingly given her, making light even of what he had just said,\r\nand forcing himself to speak much more hopefully than he dared to\r\nfeel.\r\n\r\n\"Lem, you know,\" he said, \"has gone to New York to find a witness who\r\nwill certainly clear me if we can bring him into court.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ruth told me that he had gone, and the object of his going, as far as\r\nshe knew, but he did not give her any particulars.\"\r\n\r\n\"No? Then I'll tell you all about it.\"\r\n\r\nThereupon he proceeded to inform her of all the untoward events that\r\nhad happened to him after his leaving her on the last night they were\r\ntogether; his running through the woods and falling into the new road;\r\nthe aid given him by the little elderly gentleman; the missing of the\r\nboat he had hoped to catch; the opportune arrival of the old man,\r\nprobably a smuggler, etc., etc., just as has already been narrated in\r\nhis interview with Lem, but much more slowly, as this time the story\r\nwas much broken by affectionate condolences and consequent digressions\r\nto love-making. He told her also of Lem's unsuccessful attempt to\r\nlearn from Peter Van Deust who the little gentleman was.\r\n\r\n\"What a pity it is,\" she said, \"that you did not think to ask him his\r\nname! Was there nothing about him that you can remember that might\r\nhelp to his identification--no personal peculiarity of look, or dress,\r\nor manner of speech?\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head regretfully, saying, \"I was not much in the humor to\r\nnotice peculiarities just then. But yes, come to think about it, there\r\nwas one little incident that rather amused me at the time, badly as I\r\nfelt; but I have not thought of it since until now. The little\r\ngentleman had a very slow, cautious, and precise way of speaking. I\r\nasked him what time it was, when we were down at the beach. He pulled\r\nout his watch and replied very deliberately: 'Without desiring to be\r\nunderstood as committing myself to an affirmation of the absolute\r\naccuracy of my time-piece, I may say that, to the best of my\r\ninformation and belief, it is now eleven minutes past ten o'clock.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I have seen him! I recognize his phrase, 'information and\r\nbelief'!\" exclaimed Mary, \"and know just how he said it. Ruth and I\r\nmet him the first time he came into the neighborhood, looking for the\r\nVan Deusts, 'supposed to be brothers' as he then said. Ruth imitates\r\nhim, sometimes, and does it very well. When we come to match together\r\nour remembrances of him, I am sure we will be able to give Lem some\r\ninformation that will help him to find the man.\"\r\n\r\n\"I certainly hope you may,\" answered Dorn, \"for I can do nothing more.\r\nI have got to resign myself to play the passive part of a football for\r\nother people to bounce about, without being able to help myself,\r\nwhether I am going into the goal or the ditch. I have a lawyer, but he\r\nseems to look rather blue over the prospect.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then get another.\"\r\n\r\n\"And have two of them looking blue? No, no. That would be more than I\r\ncould stand. One is enough. Sailors don't take very kindly to lawyers,\r\nany way, you know.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of an hour--a very short time as it seemed to them, but the\r\nlimit set by the jailor, who now appeared, looking in at the corridor\r\ndoor from time to time, with an air of expectation--Mary said she\r\nwould have to be going.\r\n\r\n\"How did you come over?\" asked Dorn.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Thatcher brought me.\"\r\n\r\n\"The--mischief he did! And did he know you were coming to see me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he brought me for the purpose. Oh, Dorn, he has turned to be\r\never so kind and good to me! I told him I loved you--\"\r\n\r\n\"God bless you, my darling!\" exclaimed her lover, interrupting her\r\nwith a kiss.\r\n\r\n\"--and that we were going to be married. And he did not say one word\r\nagainst it. He even said that he did not believe you were guilty; and\r\nwhen I told him I wanted to come and see you, he answered that he\r\nwould hitch up early this morning and bring me; and so he did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mary, if I've ever said a word against Uncle Thatcher I want to take\r\nit all back. A man who does me as good a turn as he has this day, I\r\ncan never after hold any grudge against.\"\r\n\r\nMary went home that night with a much lightened heart, and looked so\r\nnearly happy that Aunt Thatcher would have liked to have bitten her,\r\nfor sheer vexation and spite.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.\r\n\r\nDORN'S TERRIBLE MISTAKE.\r\n\r\nDorn Hackett's preliminary examination by a committing magistrate took\r\nplace before Squire Bodley, and was even a more important event, for\r\nall the country around, than the inquest had been. As upon the former\r\noccasion, the Squire's little office was crowded densely, and\r\napparently by exactly the same persons who filled it then,--with the\r\nexception that the small space within the railing was somewhat more\r\njammed by the addition of five more persons than were there at the\r\ntime of the inquest; the prisoner, Dorn Hackett; his lawyer, Mr. Dunn;\r\nthe prosecuting attorney; the officer who brought Dorn from Sag Harbor\r\njail, and a reporter from New York. Peter Van Deust was seated where\r\nhe sat before, looking fearfully worn and old, as was remarked by all\r\nwho knew him and viewed with surprise the great change that had been\r\nwrought in him within the few weeks since his brother's murder. He had\r\nmore command over himself now, however, than he showed on the first\r\nday of the inquest; and instead of bowing his head and weeping, leaned\r\nupon the end of the table and fixed his eyes with a hungrily keen gaze\r\nupon the witnesses and the prisoner, as if he would fain have\r\npenetrated their hearts to know the truth.\r\n\r\nLem Pawlett was called, but did not respond, and in his absence\r\nanother witness formally testified as to the facts of the discovery of\r\nthe murder. Peter Van Deust repeated his former testimony. Then the\r\nprosecuting attorney called the name of Mary Wallace.\r\n\r\n\"Stop a moment,\" interposed the prisoner's counsel. \"I desire to know\r\nthe object of the prosecution in calling this witness?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is neither customary nor requisite,\" responded the prosecutor,\r\n\"for the State to give such information. At the same time, I have no\r\nobjection, under the existing circumstances, to inform the counsel\r\nthat we intend to prove, by this witness, that the prisoner was in the\r\nvicinity of where this murder was perpetrated upon the night of its\r\nperpetration; keeping himself in the woods, evading the sight of\r\nformer friends and neighbors, though he had not re-visited them or\r\nmade himself known among them for three years or more, and that he\r\nparted from the person we have just called as a witness a little while\r\nbefore the hour at which the murder, as we have reason to believe, was\r\ncommitted.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are ready to admit,\" replied Mr. Dunn, \"that the prisoner was in\r\nthe woods within a half, or possibly a quarter, of a mile of the Van\r\nDeust homestead on the night of the murder; that for what seemed to\r\nhim good and sufficient reasons, yet very innocent ones--which the\r\nyounger portion of my hearers will possibly imagine and appreciate\r\nmore readily than the old ones--he _did_ seek to avoid meeting any\r\ninquisitive and gossiping friends; and that he parted from the person\r\nwhom the State has just called before the hour at which the murder was\r\ncommitted. I believe those admissions cover all the State desires to\r\nshow by this witness, and consequently, I do not see that there can be\r\nany necessity, at this time, for placing her on the stand.\"\r\n\r\n\"None at all. We are satisfied with the admissions,\" assented the\r\nprosecutor cheerfully, not at all dissatisfied with expediting\r\nbusiness in the close and heated quarters in which he found himself.\r\n\r\nA look of relief, almost of pleasure, passed over Dorn's face. He had\r\nhis Mary spared the embarrassment and unhappiness of appearing as a\r\nwitness against him, for that time at least.\r\n\r\nA man named Schooly, from New Haven, testified that he saw Dorn in his\r\nboarding-house in that city two days after the date of the murder, and\r\nhe was then suffering from some cuts, bruises, and sprains which he\r\nclaimed to have received while running through the Long Island woods\r\nat night.\r\n\r\nDetective Turner bore witness to the finding in the prisoner's room in\r\nNew Haven of a pair of pantaloons and a jacket stained with blood, and\r\na shirt which, though it had been washed, still bore blood stains. He\r\nfurther narrated that the prisoner had stoutly resisted arrest; had,\r\nindeed, fought hard to effect an escape; and upon being overcome and\r\nsearched, had been found to have, in a belt about his body, some three\r\nhundred dollars in gold coins--which the witness here produced for\r\ninspection by the magistrate, and possible identification by Mr. Peter\r\nVan Deust.\r\n\r\nThe old man looked them over a little, and then pushed them away with\r\na weary sigh, saying simply:\r\n\r\n\"Jacob had gold in his bag; I don't know how much. Minted coins are\r\nall alike.\"\r\n\r\nThe case looked very weak for the prosecution. There was really\r\nnothing beyond mere suspicion to connect the prisoner with the crime.\r\nThe prosecuting attorney, with a discontented look, whispered to the\r\ndetective,--who was evidently uneasy,--and shuffled over again the\r\npages of the testimony taken at the inquest, with a faint hope that he\r\nmight find there some previously overlooked clue to be of service now.\r\nBut there was nothing.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner's counsel leaned back to his client and whispered\r\nexultantly: \"I defy any jury, or magistrate, to find on that evidence\r\nanything worse than the Scotch verdict of 'Not Proven.'\"\r\n\r\n\"'Not Proven'?\" exclaimed Dorn, \"I don't want such a verdict as that.\r\nCast a cloud of suspicion and doubt over my whole life! No, I'd rather\r\nbe hanged at once and done with it. What I demand is a verdict of 'Not\r\nGuilty.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Better be satisfied with what you can get. 'Not Proven' would be just\r\nas good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not for me. I want to tell the Squire, and everybody, just what\r\nhappened to me that night. I'm sure that they will see I am telling\r\nthe truth, and I'll clear away this suspicion.\"\r\n\r\nAn older and shrewder practitioner than Mr. Dunn would have positively\r\nrefused to permit his client to imperil, by a word, the present\r\npromising condition of his case; but he could not help entering into\r\nthe feeling of the brave, handsome and earnest young fellow who\r\npleaded so hard to be permitted to defend himself with the truth, and\r\nyielded.\r\n\r\n\"If your honor pleases,\" he said simply, \"my client requests to be\r\npermitted to make his own statement of the events of the night in\r\nquestion affecting him, or in which he had a part.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be happy to hear him,\" answered Squire Bodley, who was\r\nconscious of feeling prepossessed in Dorn's favor, and desirous of\r\nseeing him clear himself from suspicion.\r\n\r\nThe prosecuting attorney looked up with a new light of hope in his\r\neyes. Well he knew how even innocent persons sometimes tangle\r\nthemselves up in trying to tell a straight story, and how their\r\nunpractised and unguarded utterances can be garbled, warped, and\r\nmisconstrued. But Dorn's manner gave him very little encouragement. In\r\na plain, straight-forward way, that went home with the force of truth\r\nto the hearts of all who heard him, the young man told his brief tale\r\nof mal-adventure on that luckless night.\r\n\r\nWhy he had come to Long Island that evening and tried to avoid being\r\nseen by anybody but the person he came to see was, he said, his own\r\nbusiness--had no bearing on this affair--and he did not propose to\r\nmake any statement about that. He did not need to. Already it had in\r\nsome way become matter of public knowledge all over that end of Long\r\nIsland that he had come to see Mary Wallace, his sweetheart, who stuck\r\nto him so well in his trouble that she had been to see him in jail.\r\nAnd nobody thought the worse of him for that, certainly.\r\n\r\nHaving disposed of that matter so simply, he retold his story, from\r\nthe time of his starting to run through the woods to catch Mr.\r\nHollis's sloop up to his final arrival at his home in New Haven the\r\nnext morning. \"Deeply I regret,\" he said, in concluding the narrative,\r\n\"that I do not know the two persons who assisted me; the gentleman on\r\nhorseback and the old man in the smack; and beyond measure grateful I\r\nwould be to them if they, learning of the trouble into which I have\r\ninnocently fallen, would come forward to corroborate my statement of\r\nwhat happened that night.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you know of absolutely nothing,\" said the prosecuting attorney,\r\nafter a little whispering with old Peter Van Deust, who was seen to\r\nviolently shake his head, \"which might lead to the discovery of the\r\nreal existence of either of those persons who, according to your very\r\nromantic story, came so opportunely to give you their aid?\" He spoke\r\nwith an affectation of incredulity, which in his heart he was very far\r\nfrom feeling.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing whatever, sir,\" replied Dorn. \"The only trace I have left of\r\neither of them, except the memory of their kindness to me, is the\r\nhandkerchief which the little gentleman bound around my head. It has\r\nbeen washed, with the rest of my clothing over which the blood flowed\r\nfrom my scalp wounds, and was sent to me yesterday in the valise which\r\nwas forwarded to me from my boarding house in New Haven. I have it\r\nwith me. Here it is.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying he drew from one of his pockets a large white linen\r\nhandkerchief, clean and neatly folded, which he handed to the\r\nprosecuting attorney. That official took it in an absent-minded way,\r\nlooked at it negligently, and--his mind busy with some trap he was\r\nminded to set for the young man--then tossed the light fabric\r\ncarelessly from him upon the table. It fell before old Peter Van\r\nDeust, who snatched it up and, after turning it from one corner to\r\nanother for close examination, suddenly startled everybody by a loud\r\ncry and the exclamations:\r\n\r\n\"It was his! It was Jacob's! I can swear to it!\"\r\n\r\nThe old man was immediately recalled to the witness-stand, and\r\ntestified with much demonstration of excitement:\r\n\r\n\"I felt that it was his as soon as I saw it, and when I examined it I\r\nwas sure of it. Jacob had some harmless, womanish ways about him. He\r\ncould sew, and knit, and embroider a little. He marked all his\r\nclothing himself--every article of it I believe--in a very modest way;\r\nhardly discernible at a casual glance, but very plain when you come\r\nto look for it, as you can see on that handkerchief. Look in that\r\ncorner and you'll see his initials '_J. V. D._' worked with a single\r\nwhite thread. You can hardly see it without you hold it so that the\r\nlight will show the lines of the letters lying across the threads of\r\nthe fabric. There! That way it shows plainly.\"\r\n\r\nIt was as he said. The letters \"_J. V. D._\" were unquestionably there.\r\n\r\nDorn sank back in his seat aghast and terrified by this astonishing\r\ndiscovery. Who now believed his story of the little gentleman and the\r\nold man in the smack? Nobody. Everybody saw that it was an artfully\r\nconcocted lie, and was indignant with him for duping them, by his\r\napparently ingenuous and honest manner, into momentarily believing\r\nhim. An audible murmur about the \"finger of Providence\" ran through\r\nthe throng, and Mr. Dunn groaned, half to himself and half to his\r\nclient:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I was afraid you'd play the devil somehow! Why couldn't you have\r\nlet well enough alone?\"\r\n\r\nSquire Bodley, having carefully examined for himself the marked\r\nhandkerchief, said solemnly to the accused:\r\n\r\n\"Young man, you have, I fear, placed the noose about your own neck.\r\nYou will stand committed to await the action of the Grand Jury.\r\nWithout bail, of course,\" he added, seeing that the prisoner's counsel\r\nhad risen and seemed about to say something.\r\n\r\nWhatever it was that Mr. Dunn had an idea of saying or doing when he\r\ngot upon his feet, he changed his mind and sat down again. The fact\r\nwas that he was as completely stunned as was his client by the\r\nrevelation that had been made. Dorn had sworn to him that he was\r\ninnocent, and he had believed it. But now--? He, even, began to have\r\nhis doubts.\r\n\r\nAt this moment a sharp-featured woman, wearing a sun-bonnet and with a\r\ntangled lock of sandy hair hanging down her back, having literally\r\nfought her way to the railing, leaned over it and asked the magistrate\r\nin an acidulous whisper:\r\n\r\n\"Squire, can't I swear to something against him?\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be useless, now, Mrs. Thatcher,\" replied the Squire, \"as he\r\nhas already been committed. But your evidence might be desired by the\r\nGrand Jury. What can you testify to?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can swear,\" answered the woman, with eager spite, \"that he's a\r\nhardened villain, and that I believe he killed Jake Van Deust, and\r\nthat he's been keeping that fool niece of mine out in the woods to the\r\nlatest and most indecent hours of the night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" said the Squire, with mingled dignity and contempt, \"you will\r\nexcuse my saying that you are simply disgusting! Go away!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE MAD AVENGER.\r\n\r\nNobody could devote himself with greater assiduity to an almost\r\nhopeless task than Lem Pawlett did to his pursuit of the unknown\r\nlawyer. The weather was exceedingly hot in the city, and he,\r\naccustomed to breathing the pure fresh breezes of the sea-shore, felt\r\nit terribly oppressive. The pavements were very hard to his feet, used\r\nto the soft earth and sand of the country, and he was actually lame\r\nmost of the time. The interminable streets and the multitude of people\r\nconfused him and gave him a horrible sense of isolation among them\r\nall. Then he very much missed little Ruth's affectionate despotism,\r\nand her practical good sense and encouragement, for he had so many\r\ndisappointments and discouragements to encounter that he was fairly\r\nheart-sick almost all the while. Still the good fellow did not give up\r\nhis chase. He had come to town for a purpose, he said to himself, and\r\nhe would succeed in it or die trying. Day after day he haunted the\r\ncourts and the streets where there were most lawyer's offices, and it\r\nwas not long before he became actually a terror to all the little\r\nelderly gentlemen who practised law in New York--and there were a\r\ngreat many of them, as there are even yet. Seeing one who, it seemed\r\nto him, might come within the somewhat wide specifications he alone\r\nhad for his guidance, of being small and past middle age, it was his\r\nhabit to buttonhole the suspected person and put to him directly the\r\nquestion:\r\n\r\n\"Do you know the Van Deusts of Easthampton?\"\r\n\r\nThey all said \"No.\" A very few of them, at first, had curiosity enough\r\nto add \"why?\" But upon his commencing his story which from his manner\r\npromised to be long, they would always exclaim, \"Ah! One\r\nmoment--excuse me. I see a man--\" and would dart away. Generally they\r\ndid not even ask \"why?\" but darted away about their own business all\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\nHis frequent repetitions of the same question were overheard by other\r\nmembers of the bar than those to whom it was addressed, and it was\r\nobserved that the interrogation was always directed to little, elderly\r\ngentlemen. So very speedily it became a stock-joke among the\r\nprofession for waggish counsellors to ask of his selected class of\r\nvictims, at the most inopportune times and unexpected places, \"_Do_\r\nyou know the Van Deusts of Easthampton?\" until they were almost\r\nmaddened by the iteration.\r\n\r\nOne jocose attorney christened Lem \"The Mad Avenger,\" and by that\r\ntitle he was soon generally known. The poor fellow was much puzzled to\r\naccount for the hilarity that his appearance in court sometimes seemed\r\nto occasion; for the general interest that appeared to be awakened\r\namong the lawyers when he approached one of whom he thought he should\r\nask his question; and for the angry haste with which the person so\r\napproached would reply, oft-times before he said more than \"Do you--\"\r\nwith an emphatic \"No. Never heard of them in my life.\" Sometimes he\r\nasked the same person, twice or thrice even, on different days, for he\r\ncould not be expected to remember them all.\r\n\r\nThere are always haunting the courts a few poor, harmless mad\r\npeople,--wrecks whose hearts and minds have been at some time crushed\r\nby the Juggernaut of the law. The mercy of forgetfulness has wiped\r\naway the memory of ruinous defeat and made place for ever-springing\r\nhope in their breasts. They imagine always that their cases are\r\n\"coming on very soon--to-morrow, perhaps;\" for the bitter,\r\nheart-sickening lesson of legal procrastination is deepest graven, and\r\nsurvives all else in their blighted brains. Lem got to be regarded as\r\none of those unfortunate beings. And then, even if he had got an\r\nopportunity to tell his story to anybody, the chances are that it\r\nwould have been taken for a fiction of his imagination. Still he\r\nplodded on indefatigably, with his eyes always open for the wanted\r\nwitness, and his one question ever trembling on his lips. His manner\r\nof operation was certainly not the best,--not the one that a skilful\r\ndetective would have adopted,--but it was the best he knew; and sooner\r\nor later Providence is pretty certain to help those who endeavor for\r\nthemselves as earnestly and well as they know how.\r\n\r\nOnce only he sought to make a divergence from the path upon which he\r\nhad set out. He went to the police, thinking to ask their aid. The\r\nsuperintendent received him brusquely, demanding as soon as he put\r\nhis foot over the threshold of the office:--\r\n\r\n\"Well, my man, what do you want?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have come, sir, to ask some help here in finding out about the\r\nmurder of Jacob Van Deust, of Easthampton, Long Island.\"\r\n\r\nThe superintendent referred to a book at his elbow, and replied\r\ncurtly, \"Man on that case now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know there is,\" answered Lem, \"but it seems to me that he's on\r\nthe wrong tack, and--\"\r\n\r\nThe superintendent did not trouble himself to hide his contempt for\r\nthe criticism of an unprofessional, and a countryman at that, upon one\r\nof his force of detectives, and interrupted with the abrupt retort:\r\n\r\n\"Very probably. But I guess you are not likely to teach him his\r\nbusiness. Martin!\"--turning to his messenger--\"Tell the captain I'll\r\nsee him now.\"\r\n\r\nLem accepted this discourteous dismissal, and found his way into the\r\nstreet without anybody seeming to have noticed that he said,\r\n\"Good-day, sir.\"\r\n\r\nSingularly enough as it might appear, in view of the notoriety that\r\nLem's question had obtained among the lawyers, but for a very\r\nexcellent reason, nevertheless, the one man of all of them who could\r\nhave responded \"yes;\" the one man of whom he was in search, had not in\r\nall this time heard that anybody was hunting an acquaintance of the\r\nVan Deusts and, though he was the only person in New York who had any\r\ndirect business interest in the Van Deusts, knew anything about them\r\nor would have been likely to know of any important event happening to\r\nthem, he had not even heard that Jacob Van Deust had been murdered.\r\nThat one man was Mr. Pelatiah Holden. Of late years he had practiced\r\nvery little in the courts. He had amassed a considerable fortune--one\r\nso regarded in those days, at least--by the exercise of his\r\nprofession; and as he grew older and attained a high and deserved\r\nreputation by his ability, gradually drifted into the comparatively\r\nquiet, easy, and lucrative life of an office lawyer--one who gives\r\ncounsel to other lawyers in difficult and important cases. His deep\r\nlearning in the law, his wide knowledge of rulings and precedents, and\r\nhis great caution in forming and framing opinions, gave weight and\r\nvalue to his advice, and put him in the position of a general who\r\nplans battles for others to fight, but seldom finds himself directly\r\nengaged in combat.\r\n\r\nIt was his custom to go to his office at an early hour every week-day\r\nmorning; lock himself in a little inner room, the walls of which were\r\ncovered with a magnificent legal library; receive there only persons\r\nwho came on such important business as could not be attended to by Mr.\r\nAnderson, his old and able confidential clerk; have a lunch handed\r\ninto him at noon precisely; and, at four o'clock to leave for his home\r\nsomewhere in the upper part of the city. During his seclusion in that\r\ninner room, he was constantly busy, poring over law books, reading\r\npoints submitted by counsel, and writing opinions. When a person was\r\nadmitted to see him, the very atmosphere by which he was surrounded,\r\nwas a warning against waste of time in idle conversation. Not one, of\r\neven his most intimate friends, would have dreamed of taking up his\r\ntime with mention of a new lunatic haunting the courts.\r\n\r\nSo it was that Lem met him and passed him by in the street,\r\nunconsciously, over and over again, not even knowing that he was a\r\nlawyer. The young man was so uneasy, restless and unhappy, as the days\r\nflew rapidly by, and the time for Dorn's trial was drawing nearer--for\r\nthe grand jury had found an indictment against him within a week\r\nafter his commitment by the magistrate, and he was to be tried for his\r\nlife at the next session of the court--that he could no more sleep at\r\nnight than rest in the daytime, and was almost constantly strolling\r\naimlessly about the streets, growing thinner, more careworn and\r\ndespondent daily.\r\n\r\nOne evening, as he was passing the front of the old Chatham Street\r\ntheatre, he was surprised to hear himself called by name, and turning,\r\nfound himself face to face with Silas Thatcher. He had not seen the\r\nscapegrace for more than three years, had never been at all intimate\r\nwith him, and hardly recognized him now, so greatly had his appearance\r\nchanged. Silas was dressed in black cloth, wore a silk hat, flashing\r\nbreast-pin and shining boots, had a moustache and goatee, and was\r\nsmoking a long cigar. In all respects he was a good sample of the lot\r\nof a dozen or more fellows lounging near the theatre door, every one\r\nof whom was known to the police as a gambler or a thief, and most of\r\nthem as deserving official notice in both characters. The vulgar\r\naffectation with which he sought to impress his rustic acquaintance,\r\ndid not lacquer over the coarse blackguardism of his customary\r\nmanners, and Lem, without well knowing why, felt an instinctive\r\ndislike for, and distrust of, him. Still, he stood and talked a little\r\nwhile, telling the last news he had from home; that Uncle and Aunt\r\nThatcher and Mary were all well; that Eben Stebbins had gone\r\na-whaling; that the schooner \"Pretty Polly,\" with Captain Marsh and\r\nthree men, had been lost in a gale; that Dorn Hackett had come back\r\nand been arrested on suspicion of having murdered Jacob Van Deust--\r\n\r\n\"Murdered old Jake Van Deust! You don't mean to say that you folks\r\ndown in that dead-alive little village, have had the sensation of a\r\nreal murder!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! yes. A terrible sensation, too, the killing and robbery of a\r\npoor, weak, old man, and the arrest of an innocent person for the\r\ncrime.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's go and get a drink, while you tell me all about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, thank you. I don't drink. But I can tell you all about it here,\r\nall the same.\" And he told the whole story, at least, as far as it was\r\nknown to the public, instinctively suppressing, however, all mention\r\nof the evidence he hoped to find in the city.\r\n\r\n\"That handkerchief business will be likely to hang him, won't it?\"\r\nasked Silas.\r\n\r\n\"It seems very serious to his friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mighty queer that he should have had the thing!--if he isn't guilty.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet I am as sure as that I am alive this moment, that if they\r\nhang Dorn Hackett for that murder, they will hang an innocent man for\r\nthe crime of another.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, let's go and take a drink, just one. Take something light if\r\nyou like. And then we'll go around and see some life. Come on. I want\r\na drink.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you'll have to excuse me, Silas. I never drink, and I feel pretty\r\ntired; and, I think I'll go to bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go to bed! now! Why, a man isn't a hen. Night is the only time to see\r\nlife in New York. I've only been up a couple of hours or so. Come\r\nalong, and I'll show you the elephant.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, thank you. I have no desire to see him. I'd rather go to bed.\r\nGood-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, good-night,--if you will go.\"\r\n\r\nSilas, when left alone, hastily entered the bar-room attached to the\r\ntheatre, and called for a glass of brandy. While he was pouring out\r\nthe fiery beverage, an acquaintance entered, and, looking at him with\r\nsurprise, exclaimed:--\r\n\r\n\"Why, Sile! What the deuce is the matter with you? You look as if\r\nyou'd seen a ghost!\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe I have. What'll you take?\" answered Silas, dryly.\r\n\r\n\"Brandy,\" replied his friend, and the young man's looks were no more\r\ncommented on.\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.\r\n\r\nRUTH'S LETTER.\r\n\r\nWhen Lem reached the humble hotel on Pearl Street, at which he put up,\r\nhe found a letter addressed to him in the clerk's rack. It had arrived\r\nwhile he was out that afternoon. No need for him to open it to know\r\nwho it came from. One glance at the superscription was enough for him\r\nto see that Ruth's chubby little hand had guided the pen. Retiring to\r\nhis little room he opened the missive, trimmed his solitary candle,\r\nand with a countenance of happy anticipation sat himself down to read.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR OLD LEM,\" she wrote, \"I'm beginning to think that you are away\r\nan awful long time, and I'm getting real anxious about you sometimes.\r\nPerhaps you have found some handsome city lady that you think you like\r\never so much better than me, and have no idea of coming back to the\r\nvillage. If so, just mention the fact while I have some chance left. I\r\nhear that Deacon Harkins is looking out for a fourth wife, and who\r\nknows--But there, I won't plague you any more, you big, good-hearted,\r\nstupid dear. I know you won't fall in love with anybody but your\r\nlittle Ruth, any more than she will with somebody else than her big\r\nLem, and I can answer for her. But there! I haven't much time to write\r\nabout you and I, for I've got something real serious to tell you,\r\nsomething that may be a great deal of help to you in what you are\r\ntrying to do; that is, supposing you are trying what you started for,\r\nand not just to capture the handsome city lady. Mary has been to see\r\nDorn in jail, and had a talk with him about the little elderly\r\ngentleman, and he has remembered something more than he told you that\r\nmakes us both sure we have seen him, and would know him again; and\r\nit's a wonder to me that he didn't think of telling you, for he's a\r\nman you couldn't mistake. But then you men are all so flighty and slow\r\nto think about things, and you never get them right until a woman\r\ntakes them in hand.\"\r\n\r\nLem scratched his head, looked perplexed, reread the long sentence,\r\nand then muttered to himself:\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes! I see. Dorn has remembered something more--and it's the\r\nlittle elderly gentleman she and Mary have seen--and it's a wonder\r\nDorn didn't think of telling me that something he has remembered--and\r\nthe little elderly gentleman is a man I couldn't mistake. Yes, it's\r\nall clear now.\" And he read on:\r\n\r\n\"I remember him just as well as if I saw him only yesterday, and I'll\r\ntell you exactly how he looked. He wore a wig, very dark brown, nearly\r\nblack, and very neatly brushed; and he had a shirt bosom with a\r\nfrill--like those queer old heroes of the revolution in our pictorial\r\nbook of American History; and his tall silk hat had a very wide crape\r\naround it; and he had a funny little breast-pin in his frill that\r\nlooked like a square of glass with gray hair under it, and little\r\npearls around it, like grandmother's brooch. He had on a stock, a\r\nvery wide, stiff stock, that kept his head up very straight; and when\r\nhe bowed he moved as if he was only hinged in the middle. He spoke\r\nvery deliberately, and seemed to be afraid somebody would snap him up\r\nright off if he didn't say exactly the right word, and he appeared to\r\nbe too cautious ever to say anything positive. He spoke of the Van\r\nDeusts as 'supposed to be brothers,' and when Dorn asked him what time\r\nit was, he looked at his watch and replied that, 'according to his\r\ninformation and belief it was eleven minutes past ten.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Now I'm sure, Lem, that such peculiarities as his must mark him out;\r\nso that when you know them you will have little difficulty in finding\r\nhim. Do your best, darling, and make haste, for the time is getting\r\nterribly short for poor Dorn and dear Mary,--and yet it seems awful\r\nlong to\r\n\r\n                                  \"Your own little\r\n\r\n                                                     \"RUTH.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is serious. This merits consideration and dissection,\" said Lem\r\nto himself, spreading the letter on the table before him, and squaring\r\nhimself to go at it as a study. It was nearly morning when he felt\r\nthat he had fully mastered all its contents, and threw himself on his\r\nbed for a short and troubled sleep.\r\n\r\nBut the earliest lawyers on the street--those who snatch a subsistence\r\nfrom the dregs and scum of humanity thrown up daily by the currents of\r\nmisfortune and vice, upon the strands of the police courts--saw \"the\r\nMad Avenger\" already prowling about the vicinity of their offices long\r\nbefore the hour at which the civil and principal criminal courts would\r\nbe opened for business. When the judicial mills commenced their\r\ngrinding, he was within sound of their clatter, and from one to\r\nanother he wandered, anxiously and wearily, as was his custom. When\r\nthe day's grist was completed, and the grinders hurried away to their\r\nrespective offices to prepare more grain for the morrow's grinding, he\r\nmechanically followed them.\r\n\r\nIt was getting late in the afternoon; he had not yet seen anybody\r\napproximating to the picture he had in his mind's eye--the portrait\r\ndrawn by Ruth--and he was just arrived at that period of the day when\r\nhe always felt most sick with disappointment, and most sorely tempted\r\nto give up the seemingly useless pursuit and go home. He stopped\r\nbefore the little hand-cart of a street fruit vender, which was drawn\r\nup to the curbstone, to buy an apple. While he made the purchase he\r\nheard the voice of a man, who halted just behind him, saying quickly:\r\n\r\n\"Ah! I was just coming up to see you. Are you in Fordyce vs. Baxter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not having been advised by my clerk,\" said a precise and deliberate\r\nspeaker in reply, \"that any papers in an action so entitled had been\r\ndeposited in his hands, and having no other knowledge of such action\r\nthan your present mention of its title, I believe that I am justified\r\nin saying, sir, that to the best of my information and belief--\"\r\n\r\n\"Aha!\" shouted Lem, wheeling around and seeing before him the living\r\noriginal of Ruth's very exact sketch--\"You're the man I'm looking\r\nfor!\"\r\n\r\n\"What the--the--the--mischief do you mean, sir,\" exclaimed the little\r\ngentleman, warding off the hand that Lem stretched out to clutch his\r\ncollar.\r\n\r\n\"It's the Mad Avenger,\" said, laughingly, the gentleman interested in\r\nFordyce vs. Baxter. \"He will ask you, in a moment, if you know the Van\r\nDeusts of Easthampton.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I will,\" retorted Lem, growing hot and angry, \"I don't know\r\nwhy you call me the Mad Avenger--my name is Lemuel Pawlett, and I do\r\nwant to know, for very serious reasons, if this gentleman is\r\nacquainted with the Van Deusts of Easthampton.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I reply that I am,\" answered Mr. Holden, sufficiently perturbed\r\nby the immediate excitement to forget his customary caution and make a\r\npositive statement without qualification.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! The deuce you are! Then there really are Van Deusts of\r\nEasthampton!\" exclaimed the other lawyer, with genuine surprise and\r\nbeginning to feel an interest in the affair.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God! I have found you, sir. Thank God!\" ejaculated Lem,\r\nfervently, \"for I believe you can be the means of saving an innocent\r\nman's life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless my soul!\" gasped Mr. Holden--\"But, here! This is no place for a\r\nconsultation. Come up to my office;\" and he began elbowing his way\r\nthrough the crowd that had already gathered.\r\n\r\n\"But _are_ you in Fordyce vs. Baxter?\" called after him the gentleman\r\nwhose lucky inquiry had brought to Lem the good fortune of this\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Mr. Holden answered, still moving off.\r\n\r\n\"Then remember that you are retained for the plaintiff!\"\r\n\r\n\"See Anderson about it,\" shouted back the little gentleman,\r\ndisappearing with Lem in the big doorway of the stairs leading to his\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nIt was with profound astonishment and genuine sorrow that the worthy\r\nlawyer heard of the murder of Jacob Van Deust, for he had achieved\r\nquite a liking for the younger of the two brothers.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said he, \"I am tempted to say that it seems to me somewhat\r\nstrange that I have not been notified of the fact by the surviving\r\nbrother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Old Peter is greatly broken down, sir; more shaken by the loss of his\r\nbrother than any one would have believed he could be, seeing how hard\r\nand selfish he always used to seem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" replied Mr. Holden, meditatively, his eyes resting upon the\r\nmourning band of his hat on the table before him. \"The rupture of\r\nlife-long ties gives deep pain. We are such creatures of habit, if\r\nnothing more. We miss a face to which we have long been accustomed; a\r\nvoice that we had thought was only in our ears, when it was in our\r\nhearts all the while. When the grave covers that face and there is\r\nonly silence, or the sadness of its own echoes in the lonely heart,\r\nthe world is no longer the same--But, there!--Don't talk about it any\r\nmore. You have not yet told me how I can, as you said in the street,\r\nsave the life of an innocent man.\"\r\n\r\n\"The man arrested for that murder, perpetrated at or about midnight,\r\nas is supposed, is the one you found in the road suffering from the\r\nconsequences of a severe fall, and whom you helped to leave Long\r\nIsland, in a disabled condition, nearly two hours earlier that night\r\nthan Mr. Van Deust was killed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! If I did not know of what the police are capable, I should be\r\nsurprised at it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know he is innocent, sir; and I know it, and Ruth, and Mary, his\r\nsweetheart; we all know it. But they would hang him if we couldn't\r\nprove it.\"\r\n\r\nThe reaction from his long sustained anxiety, the present excitement\r\nand his joyful emotion over finding the man upon whom he looked as\r\nDorn's saviour, so affected the poor fellow that he cried like a\r\nschoolboy.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" assented Mr. Holden reflectively, \"that is practically what the\r\nlaw seems to require sometimes--and it is hardly ever an easy thing to\r\ndo. But, come, my good fellow! Leave that crying for the girls you\r\nmentioned and give me all the facts you possess bearing on the case.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I--can't help it, sir. Don't mind me--I'll be over it directly. I\r\nknow it's weak, and foolish,--but I've been worked up so, fearing I\r\nwouldn't find you in time.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes Lem recovered his self-control, and then it took but\r\na very short time for the skilful lawyer to elicit every detail of the\r\nprogress of Dorn's case. Lem was surprised at seeing him smile when\r\nthe discovery of the handkerchief, the strongest point against the\r\naccused, as it was deemed, was mentioned, but did not dare to ask him\r\nwhy he did so. When the narration was concluded, Mr. Holden asked:\r\n\r\n\"When is his trial to come off?\"\r\n\r\n\"On Tuesday next, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tuesday next. H'm. Prosecution will take up first day; defence not be\r\nreached before Wednesday--and this is Thursday--leaves me four days to\r\nget through what I have on hand. Oh, Mr. Anderson!\"\r\n\r\nThe door opened noiselessly in response to his loud summons, and the\r\nold clerk poked in his head.\r\n\r\n\"If Mr. Sarcher comes to retain me in Fordyce _vs._ Baxter, you will\r\ndecline to take his papers unless he can wait for an opinion until\r\nafter next week.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is all, Mr. Anderson.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you.\"\r\n\r\nThe clerk bowed and retired his head, again carefully closing the\r\ndoor. Mr. Holden turned to Lem and said, cheerily:\r\n\r\n\"With Heaven's help, young man, we will save your friend's neck.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! I'm quite satisfied you will, sir, I'm easy in my mind about it,\r\nnow that I've seen you. Did you know there's a schooner goes to Sag\r\nHarbor, Tuesdays and Fridays, starting at five o'clock in the evening\r\nfrom Coenties Slip?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know. I have taken it before, and will again, God willing,\r\nnext Tuesday evening. Go home, see your friend and his sweetheart, and\r\ncheer them up, especially the girl. Tell them I'll--well, no; on\r\nsecond thoughts, you'd better say nothing about my evidence that you\r\ncan avoid;--he would tell his counsel who must be, metaphorically\r\nspeaking, an ass, or he would have kept his client quiet at the\r\npreliminary examination--and it might get to the other side. That\r\nmight do harm. It is always unwise to let your antagonist in law know\r\nyour weapons.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI.\r\n\r\nTHAT SWEET BOON--TRIAL BY JURY.\r\n\r\nOn the day that Dorn Hackett's trial commenced, the little court-house\r\nof Sag Harbor was by no means large enough to contain half the people\r\nwho came from all the country around to attend it. From the\r\nneighborhood in which the murder had been committed, they seemed to\r\nhave come in a body. Old acquaintances, neighbors, friends of the\r\nprisoner--who had known him since he was a child; who had heard as\r\nfresh the news that his father, William Hackett, had been swept\r\noverboard from a whaler's yard-arm and lost in a gale, and who had\r\nseen the drowned man's little orphan boy grow up to young manhood\r\namong them--were present by dozens; yet among them all one could\r\nhardly hear a few faint expressions of sympathy for him, or hope for\r\nthe demonstration of his innocence. There is nothing for which\r\nignorant people, particularly rustics, are so ready as the acceptance\r\nof the guilt of a person accused legally of a crime; nothing they\r\nresent so deeply as what they believe to be an attempt to deceive them\r\nby a false assumption of innocence. The discovery of the marked\r\nhandkerchief in his possession, had been, to their narrow minds,\r\nconclusive evidence of Dorn's guilt and each man of them felt it an\r\ninsult to what he deemed his intelligence, that Dorn had, just before\r\nthat discovery, betrayed him into a temporary fear that they might not\r\nhave the right man after all.\r\n\r\nDeacon Harkins, who, by the way, had tried to have Dorn, as a child,\r\nindentured to him by the county overseer of the poor, as soon as he\r\nheard of the drowning of the lad's father--a slavery from which the\r\nboy was saved by the kindness of a good old man, long since dead--was\r\nprominent in the crowd about the court-house, quoting texts and\r\nvaunting the foresight with which he had \"always looked forward to\r\nseeing that young man come to a bad end.\" Aunt Thatcher, was of\r\ncourse, present, and--as might have been expected--vindictively\r\nexultant. Mary Wallace, having been summoned as a witness by the\r\nprosecution, was compelled to attend, and made her way through the\r\nthrong to the county clerk's office, beneath the court-room, where she\r\nwas given a seat to wait until she should be called. Happily there was\r\nstill humanity enough among the rough people who were eagerly awaiting\r\nthe conviction of her lover, to prompt some little sympathetic feeling\r\nfor her; and, as she went by, they at least refrained from saying, in\r\nher hearing, that they hoped Dorn Hackett would be hanged. Aunt\r\nThatcher was incapable of such delicacy and reserve. She had been\r\nsaying that daily, and almost hourly, since she had heard of his\r\narrest, and she continued to say it now, loudly too, until the\r\ndisgusted county clerk ordered her to keep quiet or get out of his\r\noffice, to which she had forced her way with Mary.\r\n\r\nThere was little difficulty in getting a jury, for in those days fewer\r\nnewspapers were read than now are; fewer people sought to escape jury\r\nduty by deliberately \"forming and expressing opinions relative to the\r\nguilt or innocence of the accused\" in advance of the trial; and, above\r\nall, lawyers had not yet developed, as they since have, the science of\r\ndelay at that point of the proceedings. Twelve \"good men and true\"\r\nwere selected--perhaps a sample dozen as juries go. One of them heard\r\nwith great difficulty; two kept yawning and dropping asleep from time\r\nto time; a fourth belied his looks, if he was not at least\r\nsemi-idiotic; three were manifestly weak, simple-minded persons,\r\ndevoid of moral force and easy to be influenced by a stronger will,\r\nand the remaining five were evidently men who doubtless meant to do\r\nright, but were obstinate to the verge of pig-headedness, and showed,\r\nby the countenances with which they regarded the prisoner, that they\r\nwere already inimical to him. And before this \"jury of his peers\" Dorn\r\nHackett stood, to be tried for his life.\r\n\r\nIt would be time and space lost to recite the thrilling opening speech\r\nof the prosecuting attorney; to tell how vividly he depicted the\r\nhorrors of the crime that had been perpetrated; how artfully he\r\nseemed, by word and gesture, to connect the prisoner with the crime at\r\nevery stage of its progress; how scornfully he dwelt upon \"the absurd\r\nstory by which the murderer had sought to explain away the damning\r\nproofs against him, and which his counsel might have the audacity to\r\nask this intelligent jury to believe,\" etc. It was more like a closing\r\nthan an opening speech, and when it was ended, five of the jury looked\r\nas if they were satisfied that the proper thing to do would be to take\r\nthe prisoner right out and hang him to one of the big elms beside the\r\ncourt-house.\r\n\r\nMr. Dunn's heart sank within him. What had he to make headway with\r\nagainst that speech, before those five men and with that fatal marked\r\nhandkerchief ever fluttering before his eyes?\r\n\r\nThe hearing of the witnesses for the State continued slowly all the\r\nfirst day. All that had been sworn to before the committing\r\nmagistrate, was repeated now, and there was really very little more,\r\nbut that little was adroitly handled, and the temper of the jury was\r\nto make the most of it. Peter Van Deust produced a great effect when\r\nhe gave his testimony as to the identification of the handkerchief\r\nbelonging to his murdered brother, which was, in the language of the\r\nprosecutor, cunningly woven into questions \"voluntarily, confidently,\r\nand impudently exhibited by the prisoner to sustain his preposterous\r\nstory.\" Poor Mary Wallace had to go on the stand and testify that Dorn\r\nhad been with her, walking and conversing, in the edge of the woods,\r\nless than half a mile from the Van Deust homestead, on the night of\r\nthe murder, and that he left her about nine o'clock. Witnesses were\r\nbrought from New Haven to testify to Dorn's arrival in that city, the\r\nmorning after the murder, with his clothes bloody, head cut, and one\r\nankle sprained; and to his admissions that he had received those\r\ninjuries while running through the woods on Long Island the night\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\"Not,\" exclaimed the prosecuting-attorney, \"as he would have it\r\nbelieved, long before the murder, but when he was fleeing red-handed,\r\nconscious that the brand of Cain was on his brow!\"\r\n\r\nThe prisoner's counsel protested against this sort of interpolation of\r\ncomments, as irregular and unfair, and the court sustained him in that\r\nview, but the majority of the jury looked as if they would have\r\nthanked the prosecutor for expressing their sentiments so forcibly.\r\n\r\nThen other witnesses were called to prove, as experts, that a man\r\nwould have time after the hour at which it was believed the murder was\r\ncommitted,--say, at midnight--to run to the Napeague Inlet, take a\r\nsail-boat and reach New Haven early the next morning. One, indeed,\r\ntestified that he had tried and accomplished the feat.\r\n\r\nAnd that was all the State had to offer. Still, the popular feeling\r\nwas that it was sufficient.\r\n\r\n\"It would hardly amount to much before a city jury,\" said the\r\nprosecuting-attorney, in confidential chat with some other lawyers at\r\nthe close of the day's proceedings, \"but I guess it will be enough\r\ndown here.\"\r\n\r\nThe jury, at the adjournment of the court for the day, gravely heard\r\nthe injunction of the judge, that they \"should refrain from talking to\r\nanybody about the case,\" and then went out and discussed the evidence\r\nwith their friends and neighbors.\r\n\r\n\"The handkerchief must hang him; that's clear,\" said everybody. \"How\r\ncould he have had it if he hadn't killed the old man?\"\r\n\r\nDorn was remanded back to the jail, where Mary had a little interview\r\nwith him, during which she wept almost constantly, and he spent all\r\nhis time in trying to console her with loving words and foolish hopes,\r\nso that neither of them said or did anything particularly reasonable\r\nor worthy of the telling here. And then Mary went back to the room\r\nthat had been assigned her in the tavern, and cried so all night, that\r\nin the morning her eyes were red and swollen almost sufficiently to\r\njustify in some measure the gratified assurance of Aunt Thatcher, that\r\nshe \"looked like a fright.\"\r\n\r\nAs for Lem Pawlett, it must be admitted that he acted in what seemed\r\nto his friends a most reprehensible and unaccountable manner.\r\nFollowing even too strictly the injunctions of Mr. Pelatiah Holden\r\nabout saying nothing to anybody, he would not even give them the\r\nsatisfaction of knowing positively that he had found his man, and\r\nthat the much needed evidence would be forthcoming in due time. He did\r\ngo so far, under Ruth's most severe pressure, as to assure her that it\r\nwould \"be all right,\" but beyond that the little maiden found that for\r\nonce her power was set at naught. He felt resting upon him a\r\nresponsibility that temporarily out-weighted his love, and the gravity\r\nof his stubborn silence awed the girl, and made her look upon him with\r\na new respect. But how he suffered! Bearing alone and in silence his\r\nweighty secret, made him feel that virtually Dorn's salvation depended\r\nupon him, and should anything happen by which that evidence would not\r\nbe forthcoming, and Dorn be hanged in consequence of its failure, he\r\nwould be neither more nor less than the executioner of his friend. The\r\nnext most unhappy man in the town that night, after the prisoner\r\nhimself, was Lem Pawlett. When, from sheer exhaustion, he fell asleep,\r\nnearly at daylight, he had a horrid dream that he was tied hand and\r\nfoot, and powerless to speak, while his witness was fleeing swiftly\r\naway from him on horseback, and that Dorn was standing before him,\r\nunder the gallows-tree, with a noose about his neck and a horrible\r\nlook of haunting reproach in his eyes. From that dream he awoke with a\r\nhowl of fright, and, fearing to go to sleep again, sprang up, dressed\r\nhimself and hurried out into the deserted main street of the still\r\nslumbering town.\r\n\r\nHe took his way toward the wharf. \"Sometimes,\" he said to himself,\r\n\"the packet from New York gets in early; hardly so early as this, but\r\nthen she might have had an extraordinary good breeze last night.\" His\r\nroad led him by the jail. He shuddered as he passed the grim, gray\r\nbuilding, for never before had it seemed to him so big, so strong, so\r\nterrible. Not one living thing did he meet in his lonely walk, and\r\nwhen he reached the wharf the most profound silence surrounded him.\r\nThe tide was rising, but without the sound of its accustomed swash on\r\nthe piles. Its influx was indicated only by a slight ripple around the\r\nobstacles it met. As far out as he could see the surface of the bay\r\nwas as smooth as a mirror. Going down some slimy green steps to a\r\nboat-landing, he dipped one hand into the water, and held it above his\r\nhead. There was not even a breath of air moving. With sullen\r\nresignation he seated himself upon a pile of lumber and waited.\r\n\r\nThe dawn appeared, then suddenly the sun rose up behind the town,\r\ncasting upon the glassy surface of the water before him long shadows\r\nof the tall warehouses, and of the people who now began to busy\r\nthemselves in the vicinity. Not the smallest ripple broke the outlines\r\nof those shadows. He looked anxiously up at the sky. Ah! with what joy\r\nhe would have seen, in the direction of New York, a myriad of those\r\nragged fleecy clouds which sailors call \"mare's tails,\" and believe to\r\nbe sure harbingers of wind. But there was not one to give him hope.\r\nThe sky looked like a monster dome of unflecked, burnished brass. It\r\nwas high tide, and a dead calm.\r\n\r\nWith a groan he turned away and retraced his steps to the tavern. An\r\nunwonted excitement began to be perceptible in the streets, the\r\ncontinuation of that of the preceding day. Already people were\r\nflocking in from the country, determined to be nearest the court-room\r\ndoors when they were thrown open. The tavern bar-room was crowded,\r\neven before the sleepy bar-keeper had his eyes well rubbed open, and a\r\nsort of general picnic scene was presented by the people breakfasting\r\non cold lunches in the shade of the elms.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII.\r\n\r\nIN THE NAME OF JUSTICE.\r\n\r\nWhen the court was opened that morning, at the usual hour, and the\r\nexpectant multitude rushed, scrambled, and tumbled in, to fight first\r\nfor front places and then for any place at all; the lawyers--who had\r\nentered by the judge's private stairway--were already seated inside\r\nthe railing, chatting and laughing with cheerful indifference; the\r\nprisoner, looking worn and haggard, was seated in his place, and the\r\ntwo drowsy jurymen were already commencing to yawn.\r\n\r\nThe defence began the presentation of its evidence immediately. Mary\r\nWallace was recalled to the stand to testify that when her lover was\r\nleaving her on the evening of the night of the murder he told her that\r\nhe was going back to New Haven in Mr. Hollis's sloop. But the\r\nprosecuting attorney objected, and the court ruled that the prisoner's\r\nstatements at that time were not admissible. Mr. Hollis, of New Haven,\r\nbore witness that Dorn had come over from New Haven with him that\r\nevening, had said that he might not return that night, and did not\r\nreturn to the beach at the appointed hour to accompany him back.\r\nAltogether, Mr. Hollis's evidence was rather injurious than otherwise,\r\nand the prosecuting attorney looked pleased as he made a note of it.\r\nLem Pawlett was called to testify that the tracks left by the murderer\r\nin the soft earth of Mr. Van Deust's garden were those of a man\r\nwearing high-heeled, fashionable boots or shoes, and having much\r\nsmaller feet than Dorn Hackett; but as he had taken no measurements of\r\nthem, and only judged from memory, and didn't know the size of Dorn's\r\nfeet, and was, as he readily admitted, a friend of the prisoner, the\r\nprosecuting attorney in cross-examination made it to be inferred from\r\nhis manner, that there was no doubt in his mind that the witness was\r\ndeliberately perjuring himself in the hope of helping the case of the\r\naccused. And at least five of the jury responsively looked as if that\r\nwas the way they felt about it.\r\n\r\nThen witnesses were put forward as sea-faring experts to prove that on\r\nthe night of the murder there was almost a dead calm on the water,\r\nsuch as would have made it impossible for a sail-boat to go from\r\nNapeague Inlet to New Haven in the time that it was claimed by the\r\nprosecution Dorn had gone. But when the prosecuting-attorney got to\r\nbullying and confusing them in cross-examination, he made them say\r\nthat they could not really swear whether the calm was that night, or\r\nthe night before, or the night after, or two or three nights distant\r\neither way; and one of them even admitted that perhaps it might have\r\nblown a gale on that particular night, for all he was now prepared to\r\nmake oath to about it. Simple-minded people, who do not know how much\r\nmore lawyers bark than bite, when going through the ordeal of\r\ncross-examination are apt to feel much as the toad proverbially does\r\nwhen he finds himself under the harrow.\r\n\r\nThings were going swimmingly for the prosecution. The defence was forced\r\nto fall back upon its last and always weakest intrenchment--proof of\r\nprevious good character and reputation. A few persons were found to\r\nswear that they had known Dorn Hackett from his boyhood, and had\r\nalways considered him honest, industrious, truthful and kind-hearted,\r\nand they were confident that such was his general reputation. Uncle\r\nThatcher was one of those witnesses, at his own request, and the\r\nprosecuting attorney, who had, in some mysterious way, learned much\r\nmore than he should have been permitted to know about the witnesses\r\nfor the defence, asked him sneeringly:\r\n\r\n\"Did not this excellent young man, about three years ago, perpetrate\r\nan unprovoked and brutal assault on your son?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" replied, the old man sternly. \"He thrashed him, as he\r\ndeserved, for a contemptible action.\"\r\n\r\nBut all those witnesses to good character had to admit that they had\r\nknown nothing of Dorn for three years past, during which time he had\r\nbeen away from the village--whaling, it was said, but for all they\r\nknew to the contrary he might have been living the most vicious and\r\nill-regulated life in some big city. Then a stronger witness in that\r\ndirection took the stand, Mr. Merriwether, of New Haven, owner of the\r\nschooner of which Dorn was master, and he could, and did, swear\r\npositively that he knew Dorn had been on a three years' whaling\r\nvoyage, had since been steadily in his employ, and was in all respects\r\nmoral, sober, and an entirely trustworthy young man of irreproachable\r\ncharacter. The prosecuting attorney seeing that this witness was one\r\nwho could not be easily bluffed or confused, contented himself with\r\nasking:\r\n\r\n\"You are his employer, are you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"And interested in getting him back to work for you, as you deem him a\r\ngood sailor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. But--\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind. That will do, sir. I am through with this witness.\" And\r\nthe prosecutor sat down, looking with a scornful smile toward the\r\njury, as if he would have said to them confidentially: \"You see this\r\nman cares nothing whether the prisoner is guilty, or not, of all the\r\ncrimes forbidden by the Decalogue, if he only serves him well.\"\r\n\r\nIn those days, a person accused was not permitted to go upon the stand\r\nin his own behalf and give his testimony, under the sanctity of an\r\noath, as is now allowed him by the law. Then, he might be granted the\r\nprivilege of making his statement, but it would be merely a statement,\r\nand the prosecution was very careful always, when a prisoner thus\r\nspoke for himself, to impress upon the jury that his unsworn\r\naffirmation of innocence was of no value whatever, when weighed in the\r\nbalance against other men's affidavits. Stress would be laid upon the\r\ntime and knowledge the accused had had to enable his preparation of\r\nhis own version of the affair, and undue prominence and importance\r\ngiven to the fact that he could not be cross-examined. In this way an\r\nartful prosecutor could generally neutralize all good effect the\r\naccused might otherwise produce, if not, indeed, make the poor\r\nwretch's asseverations of innocence absolutely harmful to him, by\r\nstirring up the suspicion, antagonism, and secret consciousness of\r\ninfallibility in the minds of the jury, who resent attempts to deceive\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nDorn was duly warned of this, yet he persisted in demanding to be\r\nallowed to tell his own story, and the court granted him permission to\r\ndo so. He told it simply, clearly, and truthfully, as he had told it\r\nbefore to Lem, to Mary, to his lawyer, and to the magistrate who\r\ncommitted him, but he made no new converts to his innocence\r\nnow--unless it might have been the clear-sighted and experienced old\r\njudge on the bench, who believed that he heard the ring of truth in\r\nthe young man's voice, and saw honesty in his frank, manly face.\r\n\r\nBut at the conclusion of the statement, as Dorn left the stand and\r\nreturned to his seat by his counsel, the prosecuting attorney silently\r\nheld aloft before the jury the marked and identified handkerchief,\r\nand that action was more conclusive in its effect upon their minds\r\nthan all that the prisoner had said. Looking upon their faces, the\r\nlawyer for the defence murmured to himself, \"We are lost!\"\r\n\r\nAs the day wore on Lem Pawlett was in agony, for his witness did not\r\nappear. It made him dizzy and sick to see one witness after another\r\nleaving the stand in such rapid succession, for he did not know how\r\nsoon the supply of them would run out, and the weak defence be\r\ncompelled to close before the one upon whom all depended should make\r\nhis appearance. \"Why had he not come? The boat was due many hours ago,\r\nand had not yet arrived! Becalmed, doubtless, on this one day of all\r\nthe days in the year. Perhaps he might not be aboard. He might be\r\nsick. What if he should be a cunning villain, the real criminal, for\r\nall his smooth exterior, who had purposely given that handkerchief to\r\nDorn to cast the guilt apparently on him? He smiled when it was\r\nmentioned. And now he might be flying far away.\" These thoughts almost\r\nmaddened Lem. Bitterly he reproached himself that he had not staid in\r\nNew York and kept his witness under his eye until the last moment, and\r\nbrought him along by force, if necessary. Again and again he was\r\ntempted to make his way to Mr. Dunn, and urge him to fight the day\r\nthrough by all means; but each time he remembered what Mr. Holden had\r\nsaid the prisoner's counsel must be, and refrained. Parched with\r\nthirst, and blazing with fever, yet with a cold perspiration breaking\r\nout all over him, poor Lem could hardly understand half that was going\r\non. But when Dorn's lawyer arose and said, \"May it please the court,\r\nthe defence rests,\" the words came to his ears like a clap of thunder.\r\nIt seemed to him that that was the last moment of grace, and he\r\nstaggered to his feet, trying to say something; to cry a halt; to\r\nappeal to the judge for time; to do, he did not know what. But his\r\ntongue clave to the roof of his mouth, and a deputy sheriff, seeing\r\nhim standing there, waving his arms and looking as if he was about to\r\nspeak, shouted at him with such an awful voice, \"Silence in the\r\ncourt,\" that he sank down, stunned and speechless in his place, as\r\nhelpless as he had been in that awful dream of the night before.\r\n\r\nThe prosecuting attorney began summing up to the jury. If he was\r\nforcible in the opening, he was terrible now. Of course he assumed\r\nthat a clear case had been made out, as prosecutors always do; that\r\n\"there was no moral doubt of the guilt of the accused, any more than\r\nif the jury had actually beheld him battering in the skull of his aged\r\nvictim, wiping the dripping blood from his hands upon the raiment of\r\nthe corpse, and clutching the gold, for lust of which he had done this\r\nhideous deed.\" [Five of the jury looked as if they quite agreed with\r\nhim; three others glanced timidly and furtively at the faces of the\r\nfive, as if to read there what they too should think about it; the\r\nsleepy men were very wide awake now, having had a good nap while the\r\nevidence as to character was being introduced; and the deaf man had\r\nboth hands up to his ears to enable him to hear better, for if there\r\nis anything that country people do love, it is a good strong speech.]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of one of his most vigorous declamatory efforts the eye\r\nof the prosecutor caught sight of the judge, who was sitting with\r\nupraised gavel and a look as if he was only waiting for the end of a\r\nsentence to arrest his progress. The speaker stopped, and the judge,\r\nlaying down his gavel, held up a note and said:\r\n\r\n\"I am in receipt of a communication which is, if written in good\r\nfaith--that is, by the person whose name is signed to it--of so very\r\nimportant a character, and has such a decided bearing upon the\r\ninterests of justice in this case, that I feel it would be in the\r\nhighest degree unwise to ignore it. I will therefore ask the\r\nprosecuting attorney to have the kindness to at least postpone for a\r\nshort time the continuation of his address to the jury. The court will\r\nnow take a recess for half an hour.\"\r\n\r\nThe densely packed and excited audience hardly waited the conclusion\r\nof the sheriff's formal repetition of the formal order of the court,\r\nto break out into a loud murmur of exclamations, conjecture, and\r\ndiscussion as to what the important communication might be. The judge,\r\nupon rising from his seat, made a sign to the prosecuting attorney and\r\nthe counsel for the defence to accompany him to his room, and the trio\r\nwent out by the private door, which they closed behind them.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Lem? What do you suppose they are going to do now?\" Ruth\r\nasked anxiously of the young man, who sat in a semi-inanimate\r\ncondition at her side, and who actually had not heard a word of what\r\nthe judge had said. He started from his dream, into which reality had\r\nagain plunged him, and replied miserably:\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. Hang him, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk nonsense, Lem. What's the matter with you? Wake up. Didn't\r\nyou hear what the judge said about his receiving an important\r\ncommunication that had a decided bearing, and all that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, 'a decided bearing upon the interests of justice in this case.'\r\nThose were his very words; and he held up a letter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it's all right now, Ruth! All right at last! He has come! He has\r\ncome!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who has come?\"\r\n\r\n\"The man who will save Dorn Hackett.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII.\r\n\r\nTURNING OF THE TIDE.\r\n\r\nIt seems a little strange to some people that a prosecuting attorney\r\nshould so hungrily devote himself to the conviction of an accused\r\nperson, even when, as is sometimes beyond question, he feels in his\r\nheart that the individual against whom he is exerting all the force of\r\nhis trained legal ingenuity, eloquence, and mental power is, in fact,\r\nguiltless of the crime alleged against him. If his gains depended upon\r\nhis success in obtaining a conviction, many who are accustomed to look\r\nupon pecuniary interest as a sufficient excuse for almost anything not\r\nabsolutely prohibited by law, would understand him better. But such is\r\nnot the case. His salary is the same, whether he succeeds in hanging a\r\nguiltless unfortunate or not. Success, in many cases, may help him to\r\nre-election: but that is not always a serious consideration. Why,\r\nthen, when he cannot convict by clear proof of guilt, does he call to\r\nhis aid the technicalities of law, the power of precedent, and all\r\nthat may enable him to even prevent the prisoner accomplishing that\r\nherculean task--the proving of his innocence? Simply because of the\r\ndevelopment in him--and the conscious possession of the widest license\r\nin its exercise--of the hunting instinct that is inherent in all\r\ncarnivorous animals, man included. He hunts the accused down to\r\ndeath, with not even the cannibal's excuse of wishing to eat him, but\r\nthat he may have the joy of triumph in the achievement, and that his\r\nreputation as a hunter may be enhanced,--as some men used to kill\r\nbuffaloes on the plains, as long as there were any, simply for the\r\nsake of the killing. In other circumstances and relations of life he\r\nmay be gentle and kind-hearted; but put him in the chase, and he knows\r\nno pity. Perhaps there are times when, after a conviction, he secretly\r\nsays to himself:\r\n\r\n\"Thank God it was the jury's work, not mine! I did not convict him!\"\r\n\r\nBut he deceives himself. The average juryman, even one who is without\r\nprejudice and means to do rightly, is but a tool of the most cunning\r\nand able of the two lawyers pitted against each other before him. Some\r\ndrops of the innocent blood the jury sheds must cling to the hands of\r\nthe prosecutor.\r\n\r\nWhen the court resumed its session, after the brief recess, another\r\nperson sat within the railing among the lawyers, a little elderly\r\ngentleman, at sight of whom Lem Pawlett almost wept for joy, and the\r\nprisoner's heart felt a thrill of hope.\r\n\r\nDorn's counsel formally announced to the court that since the closing\r\nof the defence new and most important evidence, completely\r\ndemonstrating the innocence of the prisoner at the bar, had been put\r\nin his possession, and he asked that the court grant permission for\r\nthe reopening of the defence and the admission of this testimony.\r\n\r\nThe prosecuting attorney argued long and earnestly against the\r\nintroduction of any further evidence at the present stage of the\r\nproceedings. In view of the high character and standing in the\r\nprofession of the proposed witness, who had been made known to him in\r\nthe judge's private room, and with whose reputation he was well\r\nacquainted, he did not dare to cast a shadow of suspicion upon the\r\nproposed evidence as manufactured and unworthy of belief or\r\nconsideration. Evading that issue, he confined himself to opposing as\r\ninformal, irregular, and liable to be viewed as a dangerous and evil\r\nprecedent, the reopening of the case. Even if improperly convicted for\r\nlack of this evidence, the prisoner, he argued, would still have his\r\nrelief in a new trial, which the Court of Appeals would be sure to\r\ngrant if the new testimony was indeed material.\r\n\r\nMr. Dunn made a strong plea for the accused against the injustice of\r\ncondemning an innocent man to await in prison, under the shadow of a\r\nsentence of death, and in an agony of suspense, the slow action of the\r\nCourt of Appeals, rather than disturb the mere formality of a trial.\r\n\r\nFinally, the judge ruled--as he had intended to before either of the\r\nlawyers said a word--that the new evidence should be admitted.\r\n\r\nThe little elderly gentleman, responding promptly to the crier's call\r\nfor \"Pelatiah Holden,\" took the stand, was sworn, and testified:\r\n\r\n\"My name is Pelatiah Holden; I reside in New York, and am a lawyer by\r\nprofession. I have been the legal adviser of the brothers Peter and\r\nJacob Van Deust in certain money matters; and, upon business connected\r\nwith their affairs, visited their house on the evening of the 19th of\r\nJuly, coming from New York by boat to Sag Harbor and thence riding\r\nover on horseback.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was the night upon which Jacob Van Deust was murdered, was it\r\nnot?\" the prisoner's counsel interposed.\r\n\r\n\"To the best of my present information and belief the murder was\r\nperpetrated on the night of the 19th, or morning of the 20th.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. Proceed, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"I remained with the Van Deust brothers, taking supper with them,\r\nreceiving their signatures to some papers, and holding a consultation\r\nwith them in regard to the investment of certain monies belonging to\r\nthem jointly, until, as nearly as I can now remember, about fifteen\r\nminutes before nine o'clock in the evening. They pressed me to remain\r\nall night, which I declined to do, as I had business of importance to\r\nattend to in New York, for other clients, and was desirous of\r\nreturning as speedily as possible to the city. When I took my\r\ndeparture Jacob Van Deust accompanied me to where my horse was hitched\r\nin the lane, and we stood there talking a few minutes. There was no\r\nwind stirring, and the mosquitoes annoyed me very much. In switching\r\nthem from the back of my neck with my handkerchief I dropped it\r\naccidentally, and the horse chanced to step upon it, trampling it into\r\nthe dirt of the lane. Seeing that it had been rendered unfit for\r\npresent use, Mr. Jacob Van Deust was kind enough to offer me the loan\r\nof a clean one which he had in his pocket, and I thankfully accepted\r\nit. I mounted my horse, said good-by, and set out upon a new road that\r\nMr. Van Deust--the younger brother, I mean--had recommended to me as\r\nshortening considerably the distance I had to travel.\r\n\r\n\"I had ridden, as nearly as I can judge, about a mile, or perhaps only\r\nseven-eighths of a mile, when, in passing through a cutting that\r\ndepressed the roadway to a depth of nine or ten feet below the surface\r\nof the ground on either side, I found, lying upon the ground and\r\ngroaning, a young man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you recognize that man among those here present?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do, sir. It was the prisoner at the bar. He informed me that having\r\nbeen unacquainted with the existence of that new road, he had just\r\nsustained a severe fall into it. His injuries seemed to corroborate\r\nhis statement, at least so far as the severity of his fall was\r\nconcerned. His scalp was badly cut in at least two places, and he was\r\nbleeding profusely.\r\n\r\n\"When I assisted him to rise he found that one of his ankles--the\r\nleft, I believe--was so seriously sprained that he could not bear to\r\nrest his weight upon it, and could not walk a step without assistance.\r\nI used the clean handkerchief which was in my possession, together\r\nwith one he had, to bind up his head and stanch the flow of blood,\r\nafter which I supported him to the beach, where he hoped, he said, to\r\nfind a small vessel to take him to New Haven, where he resided. But he\r\nwas only able to move very slowly, and when we arrived at the water's\r\nedge no vessel was in sight. While we were debating what was best to\r\nbe done with him, under the circumstances, a small fishing-boat came\r\nwithin a short distance of the shore, and the person directing its\r\nmovements responded to his call. He offered the person in the\r\nboat--who appeared to be an old man, accompanied by a boy--the sum of\r\nten dollars to take him over to New Haven, which offer was accepted. I\r\nassisted him to enter the boat, and, when it had sailed away returned\r\nto where I had left my horse tied to tree, remounted him, and\r\nprosecuted my journey homeward.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the giving of this evidence, a stillness prevailed in the\r\ncourt-room as if the speaker had been alone, and when his voice ceased\r\nthere was such an enormous sigh from the crowded audience as if all\r\nwere at once exhaling the pent-up breath they had not dared to free\r\nbefore for fear of losing a word of what he said. Five jurymen and the\r\nprosecuting attorney looked equally disgusted.\r\n\r\n\"At what hour that night did you last see the prisoner?\" asked Mr.\r\nDunn.\r\n\r\n\"At twenty-seven minutes past ten o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"In a small boat, sailing from the shore?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. Very slowly, however, as there was very little wind.\"\r\n\r\n\"From your knowledge of his condition at that time, do you believe it\r\nwould have been possible for him to have returned that night to Mr.\r\nVan Deust's, entered that house, perpetrated the murder with which he\r\nis charged and made his escape?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. He was very weak from loss of blood, and I know, from\r\npersonal examination, that his ankle was so severely sprained that it\r\nwould have been a physical impossibility for him to have done what you\r\nsaid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! you say that you examined his ankle. Did you notice at the time\r\nwhat kind of shoes he wore?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did. He had on the low, broad, soft shoes, with hardly any heels,\r\nwhich sailors customarily wear.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is enough, sir. Thank you. Take the witness,\" said Mr. Dunn,\r\nwith an air of triumph, to the prosecuting attorney.\r\n\r\nThat official did not seem to care about taking the witness. He knew\r\nthat it was a master in the art of cross-examination who was thus\r\nlightly turned over to him, and had no hope of entrapping him or\r\nshaking his testimony. Still, he had to make some show.\r\n\r\nIndifferently he asked: \"Of course you have no idea of who the old man\r\nin the boat was?\"\r\n\r\n\"To the best of my information and belief, his name was Jabez Sanborn.\r\nI asked him and that was what he told me.\"\r\n\r\nJabez Sanborn! Why, everybody around Sag Harbor knew about him; a shy\r\nold man, reputed a miser, who lived with a lad, his grandson, in a hut\r\nin the woods and was known to be addicted to wandering all along the\r\ncoast at night, in a little fishing-smack, on errands best known to\r\nhimself. Yes, the most likely man in the world to be met under just\r\nsuch circumstances was old Jabez Sanborn. And the least likely man to\r\nhear that a murder trial was going on in which he might be an\r\nimportant witness--or perhaps to care if he had heard it--was also old\r\nJabez Sanborn. The prosecuting attorney felt that he had not drawn a\r\ntrump that time at least. While he cast about mentally for something\r\nelse that he might ask the witness, with at least the minimum of harm\r\nto his side of the case, a startling diversion occurred to interrupt\r\nthe proceedings.\r\n\r\nOld Peter Van Deust, who had been sitting near the prosecuting\r\nattorney and directly in front of the witness, suddenly sprang to his\r\nfeet, walked up to Mr. Holden, clutched with trembling fingers the\r\nseal that dangled from his watchguard and, after examining it a\r\nmoment, cried shrilly:\r\n\r\n\"It's all a lie! All a cunningly made up story! He is an accomplice of\r\nthe assassin! This was Jacob's seal. I'll swear to it!\"\r\n\r\nAlmost everybody had jumped up in the excitement of this interruption,\r\neven the sedate judge was standing, leaning over his desk to get a\r\nbetter view of what was going on before him but below his range of\r\nvision, and there was a deafening chorus of exclamations from all\r\nsides; but above all arose the sharp voice of Peter Van Deust, crying:\r\n\r\n\"Arrest him! arrest him! I demand the arrest of this man as an\r\naccomplice!\"\r\n\r\nThe only tranquil person in the assemblage was Mr. Pelatiah Holden. He\r\nwas surprised at his client's outbreak, but only for a moment. Then,\r\nblandly saying to the almost mad old man who stood before him, shaking\r\na long, lean finger in his face, \"Mr. Peter Van Deust, you seem to be\r\nexcited.\"\r\n\r\nHe very calmly drew his watch from his fob-pocket and with the seal\r\nattached to it, passed it up to the judge. The seal was a heavy,\r\nsquare onyx, with a foul anchor engraved on one side.\r\n\r\n\"I'd swear to it among a thousand,\" shrieked old Peter. \"It belonged\r\nto my father when he was in the navy. He left it to brother Jacob. It\r\nwas stolen by the thief who murdered him.\"\r\n\r\nThe judge rapped his gavel until order was restored in the court-room,\r\nand old Peter had been fairly dragged down into a seat by the\r\nprosecuting attorney, who was nearest him--after which, addressing the\r\nwitness, he asked:\r\n\r\n\"How did this seal come into your possession, Mr. Holden?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very simply, your Honor. But before I relate how, permit me to\r\nrequest your Honor to issue strict injunctions to the officers at the\r\ndoor to permit no exit from this court-room or communication by those\r\nwithin to persons on the outside.\"\r\n\r\nThe judge was evidently surprised, but his respect for the well-known\r\nand honored Mr. Holden was sufficient to induce him to comply with the\r\nrequest without asking its reasons. When the necessary instructions\r\nhad been issued to the court officers, Mr. Holden resumed:\r\n\r\n\"About three weeks ago, while I was taking lunch one afternoon at\r\nWindust's--a very popular and well conducted restaurant on Park Row,\r\nNew York--a young man came to the box in which I was seated and\r\noffered this seal for sale. I am, as a rule, averse to the purchase of\r\npersonal property from unknown persons and in an irregular way, but\r\nthis young man told a melancholy story of his present need for money\r\nfor the sake of a widowed mother and sister, said that the seal had\r\nbelonged to his father who was a naval officer and asked for the\r\narticle a price that was at least its full value. That influenced me\r\nto purchase it. I reflected that if it had been stolen it would have\r\nbeen, in all probability, offered at a cheap price to effect ready\r\ndisposal of it, whereas if he really needed money, as he said, for his\r\nmother and sister and the thing honestly belonged to him, he would\r\nnaturally try to get as much as he could. So I gave him seventeen\r\ndollars for it and have since worn it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What,\" asked the judge, \"was your reason for requesting the careful\r\ntyling of the doors before making that statement, Mr. Holden?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I recognized to-day, in the court-yard without, as I was\r\nentering this building, the young man from whom I purchased this\r\nseal.\"\r\n\r\n\"You believe so!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am certain of it. If your Honor will permit an officer to accompany\r\nme, I believe that I will be able to bring him before you in a few\r\nmoments. When I saw him he was seated at the root of an elm tree near\r\nthe door, and alone.\"\r\n\r\nAn officer was directed to accompany Mr. Holden and they went out\r\ntogether by the private staircase. The curious throng in the\r\ncourt-room, unwilling to lose a single incident of the eventful drama\r\nunfolding itself before them, struggled hard to get out and follow the\r\nofficer and his guide, but were not allowed to do so, and returned to\r\ntheir seats with a sense of injury. Everybody was intensely excited.\r\nThe prosecuting attorney leaning over the judge's bench held a long\r\nand earnest conversation with him. The prisoner and his counsel\r\nwhispered together. The jury jabbered to each other so that even the\r\nidiotic-looking one among them seemed to awake to an interest in the\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the little door behind the judge was flung open, and Mr.\r\nHolden entered, followed by the officer and a third person--a young\r\nman, attired in a flashy sort of vulgar fashion, and wearing a dyed\r\nmustache and goatee. Many audible exclamations of astonishment were\r\nuttered among the audience, numbers of whom recognized this new actor\r\nthus brought upon the scene.\r\n\r\n\"That, your honor,\" said Mr. Holden, \"is the young man who sold to me\r\nthe seal which you now have before you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE HAND OF PROVIDENCE.\r\n\r\n\"What is your name?\" demanded the judge of the young man thus brought\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\nThe fellow hesitated an instant, and a lie trembled on his lips; but\r\nthen looking around and seeing many who could identify him, he knew\r\nthat falsehood would be useless, and sullenly replied:\r\n\r\n\"Silas Thatcher.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where do you live?\"\r\n\r\n\"On Hester Street, near the Bowery, in New York.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is your business?\"\r\n\r\n\"Haint got none.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have you to say in reply to the statement which you have just\r\nheard made by this gentleman, to the effect that you sold this seal to\r\nhim?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothin',\" answered Silas after a little hesitation.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing? But do you not understand, young man, that this may be a\r\nvery serious matter? I do not ask you that you may criminate yourself\r\nin any way, but with the hope that if you have any reasonable\r\nexplanation to offer you will not withhold it. How did this seal come\r\ninto your possession?\"\r\n\r\nSilas paled, was visibly perturbed, and hesitated longer than before;\r\nthen responded doggedly:\r\n\r\n\"I haint got nothin' to say. I want a lawyer, I do.\" The judge was\r\nsilent for a moment, then replied drily.\r\n\r\n\"Of course you are entitled to counsel. You will stand committed for\r\nfurther examination. Mr. Sheriff, adjourn court until the usual hour\r\nto-morrow morning.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a loving and a hopeful interview that Dorn and Mary had at his\r\ncell door that evening, and Mr. Holden had the pleasure of being\r\npresent during at least a part of it, when he received the heartfelt\r\nthanks of both for his opportune aid in their darkest hour. Peter Van\r\nDeust, whose wits were manifestly failing, had not seemed to\r\ncomprehend what was done in the court-room after he had sustained the\r\nviolent mental shock of recognizing his murdered brother's seal, and\r\nhad clamored, at the adjournment of the court, for the arrest of the\r\nNew York lawyer. But the judge smilingly replied, that he would\r\nhimself be responsible for the attendance of Mr. Holden, whenever it\r\nmight be required, and had gone away down the main street to the\r\ntavern, arm in arm with that gentleman; a sight that had fairly\r\nstunned poor old Peter. After dinner Mr. Holden paid his visit to\r\nDorn's cell, and the judge said he, too, would like to go along \"but\r\nfor the looks of it,\" as he \"considered Dorn now virtually a free man,\r\nand had all along suspected that he was an innocent one.\"\r\n\r\nThe prosecuting attorney was alone in his office that evening, looking\r\nover a _resumé_ of another case, that of a mere horse-thief, which\r\nwould succeed Dorn Hackett's in order of trial--for he had already\r\ngiven up all hope of hanging Dorn--when the sheriff entered, with an\r\nair of mingled eagerness and caution, to inform him, in a sort of\r\nmelodramatic whisper:\r\n\r\n\"Silas Thatcher's father has asked permission to see his son in his\r\ncell, and I have had him delayed until I could tell you. Do you wish\r\nto overhear their interview?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--rather think--I'd like to,\" answered the prosecutor, meditatively.\r\n\"I shall have him in hand before long, no doubt, and might as well\r\nknow beforehand what he has to say for himself.\"\r\n\r\nThe men passed together through the sheriff's office, and by a private\r\nentrance therefrom into the rear part of the jail, first taking off\r\ntheir boots that their steps might not be heard on the stone floor.\r\n\r\nWhen they entered the corridor, along one side of which the cells were\r\nlocated, they moved with caution, and noiselessly entered a dark and\r\nunoccupied cell adjoining that in which Silas was confined. After a\r\nlittle quiet fumbling along the wall, the sheriff found the end of a\r\nstring, which he pulled, thus conveying to his assistant in the front\r\noffice of the jail, where Uncle Thatcher was waiting, a private signal\r\nthat all was ready. In a few minutes more the grim old man was shown\r\nin by the jailor, and permitted to enter his son's cell, the door of\r\nwhich was locked upon him. Every sound made there was clearly audible\r\nwhere the prosecutor and sheriff were.\r\n\r\nSilas, to whom the interior of a prison was not altogether a novelty,\r\nhad laid down with a sort of philosophical content upon his little cot\r\nbed, but sat up, somewhat surprised, when his father appeared. The\r\njailor put upon the stone floor the tin candlestick holding a tallow\r\ncandle which he had carried in, and went away.\r\n\r\nFor some moments neither father nor son spoke a word. The old man was\r\nthe first to break the oppressive silence.\r\n\r\n\"So,\" said he, \"this is where I find you at last.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is, and what of it?\" retorted Silas sullenly.\r\n\r\n\"My God! How I have dreaded this shame!--this horror! How the fear of\r\nit has haunted me, day and night, for years!\"\r\n\r\n\"If you've come here for to preach to me, why, you might as well drop\r\nit; that's all. I ain't no chicken. I'm a man, I am, and game for all\r\nthere is in the pot. I ain't afraid. I don't want no snivellins around\r\nme!\"\r\n\r\n\"Silas, I haven't come here either to preach or snivel. I have come to\r\nlearn, if I can, whether the agony and blighting shame of seeing a son\r\nhanged is likely to be mine or not.\"\r\n\r\nThe young reprobate winced visibly at his father's plain speech, and\r\nit was with a violent effort, belied by his pallid lips and quavering\r\nvoice, that he assumed sufficient bravado to reply:\r\n\r\n\"What's the use of making a fuss about a feller's getting into a\r\nlittle scrape? I'll get out of it all right. All I want is a good\r\nlawyer. It might happen to any feller to get into a hole. Fellers get\r\ninto 'em all the time and get out of 'em again. This morning everybody\r\nthought Dorn Hackett was in the worst kind of a hole, but to-night the\r\njailor tells me everybody says he's bound to get out of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dorn Hackett was innocent. Are you?\"\r\n\r\nSilas hesitated a moment before he replied:\r\n\r\n\"Course I am! Every fellow's innocent until he's proved guilty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did you get that seal?\"\r\n\r\n\"A--a--feller gave it to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who was he?\"\r\n\r\n\"I dunno--never saw him before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Silas, you are lying to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what business have you got to come here pestering me with\r\nquestions, as if you was trying to catch me?\"\r\n\r\nIt was hard work for the old man, who was naturally of rather a\r\nviolent temper, to keep his hands off his rebellious son;\r\nnevertheless, he restrained himself.\r\n\r\n\"Silas,\" he exclaimed after a brief pause, \"there is blood upon your\r\nhands.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where? No, there isn't! They're clean!\" ejaculated the young man in a\r\ntone of fright, starting to his feet and nervously examining his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\"Fool!\" said the old man, with contempt, \"did you think I meant red\r\ndrops that human eyes could see? No. But in the sight of God they are\r\ndripping with the stains of a foul murder. I read your guilt in your\r\nskulking eyes, your impudent assumption of brazen effrontery, your\r\nfalsehoods. Ah, you will not get out of this hole as easily as you\r\npretend to think. There is but one road open from here before you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is that, father?\" asked Silas, tremblingly, for he had already\r\nbegun to lose the fictitious nerve that had hitherto sustained him.\r\n\r\n\"The gallows!\" responded the grim old man, sternly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, for the Lord's sake, don't talk like that!\" pleaded the young\r\nwretch, with a piteous howl. \"It's all your fault, anyway. You\r\nwouldn't let me have any more money, and I was hard up. You told me\r\nthe Van Deusts had a mint of money. I didn't mean to harm anybody, but\r\nhe jumped out of bed and clinched me; the jimmy was in my hand, and I\r\nwas afraid of being caught, and I--Oh! my God! what have I said?\r\nYou've got me all unnerved, with your cursed croaking. I didn't know\r\nwhat I was saying. It wasn't true. I haven't been in a mile of Van\r\nDeusts' for more'n three years. I don't know who killed Jake Van Deust\r\nany more'n you do. Dorn Hackett did it. Why don't they hang him, curse\r\nhim! and be done with it!\"\r\n\r\nHe was crying, trembling. The unhappy father bowed his face in his\r\nhands and was silent a long time, while Silas went rambling on:\r\n\r\n\"I can prove I was in New York that night. There's lots of the fellers\r\nwill swear me out of it. What if I did have the seal? Didn't Dorn have\r\nthe handkerchief? I know where I got it. I buy'ed it one night from a\r\nstranger that got broke in a faro bank. I can get fellers to swear\r\nthey see me buy it. All I want is a lawyer. You've got to get me\r\none--a good one. You will, won't you? I'm broke or I wouldn't ask you.\r\nI've had awful bad luck lately. But I'll pay you back when I get out.\r\nAnd you wouldn't see your son h--h--hanged, would you?\"\r\n\r\nUncle Thatcher raised his head and, looking fixedly at his son, asked\r\nslowly:\r\n\r\n\"Why did you come here to-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" answered Silas, almost with desperation. \"Because I am\r\na damned fool, I suppose. I met Lem Pawlett in the city, and he told\r\nme about the trial, and--somehow--I had to come. I couldn't keep\r\naway.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you still think that a lawyer could get you out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes. A good, sharp lawyer, from New York. I know of one that's up\r\nto all the dodges. He gets lots of the fellers off. He'd clear me, I'm\r\nsure of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you do not see God's hand driving you here and giving you up to\r\nman's justice? You think to contend against His will? To employ a\r\nlawyer who shall shield you from the fate He has decreed? Foolish and\r\nunhappy boy! you have sown and the day of harvest is nigh; the\r\nharvest for both of us: for you the full sheaf of ripe dishonor and\r\ndeath; for me the gleaning of bitter shame and grief. And to the Lord\r\nof this harvest we may neither of us say 'nay.'\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he arose from the cot, where he had taken a seat early in\r\nthe interview, stood before his son, and continued:\r\n\r\n\"It is not probable that I shall ever see you again. In due course of\r\ntime you will be tried, convicted, and hanged, and I shall hear of it\r\nall: that will be enough for me. As far as other people will allow me\r\nto, I shall endeavor to forget that I ever had a son. You have simply\r\nto continue, as for years past, so far as affection or respect for his\r\ncounsels were concerned, in forgetting that you have a father. Send me\r\nno gallows-tree messages of penitence and love. Carry your penitence,\r\nif you have any, to your God; and may He, in his infinite knowledge\r\nand justice, grant you such mercy and pardon as you deserve.\"\r\n\r\nWith this farewell, the wretched father took his departure, preserving\r\nhis sternness of demeanor as long as he was in his son's sight; but in\r\nthe jail office without, he gave way to his natural grief, which he\r\ncould repress no longer, and much time elapsed ere he recovered\r\nhimself sufficiently to go home. Silas, left alone in his cell, threw\r\nhimself upon his bed, on his face, alternately weeping, cursing, and\r\npraying, in a delirium of remorse and fear, and no sound of stealthy\r\nfootsteps leaving the adjoining dungeon reached his ears.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV.\r\n\r\nTHE LESSON OF PETER VAN DEUST'S LIFE.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon the opening of the court, the morning after Silas\r\nThatcher's arrest, the prosecuting attorney arose and made a neat\r\nlittle speech, in which he admitted his conviction that an error had\r\nbeen made in the accusation of Dorn Hackett, expressed his\r\ngratification at the discovery of the new and unimpeachable evidence\r\nof the innocence of the accused afforded by his learned brother from\r\nNew York, and, in conclusion, desired to move the entry of a _nolle\r\nprosequi_ in the case of the People _vs._ Dorman Hackett. In short,\r\nnever did hunter retire with better grace from a hopeless chase. The\r\nmotion was promptly granted by the court, and Dorn Hackett was a free\r\nman once again.\r\n\r\nLem Pawlett shouted and hurrahed at the top of his voice, defying two\r\nsedate officers of the court who sought to hush him; and many others\r\njoined in his cheers--almost all, indeed, for so fickle are the\r\nmultitude, so worshipful of success, and so easily influenced by\r\nimpulse, that their purposes and the currents of their feelings vary\r\nlike the shifting winds. How many there were who now said that they\r\n\"had always looked upon Dorn Hackett as a noble fellow, one who could\r\nnot be guilty of a crime!\" How many who declared they had \"thought his\r\narrest a great mistake from the first!\" And they found it the easier\r\nto forgive Dorn for escaping since they had another victim in\r\nprospect, in his stead. Not even Deacon Harkins was altogether\r\nunhappy, for he still had a horrid example at whom to aim his homilies\r\nand texts. All that was necessary was to substitute the name of Silas\r\nfor that of Dorn, and his stream of malignant cant flowed steadily on.\r\n\r\nDorn was conducted into the judge's private room, where he found Mary\r\nawaiting him with open arms, glad smiles, and tears of joy in her\r\nbright eyes. How happy and how beautiful she looked. He pressed her to\r\nhis breast, again and again, with rapture: but the lovers' hearts\r\nwere too full for speech. The greatest joys, like the deepest griefs,\r\nare voiceless; mere words humble, even profane them. Could those two\r\nloving ones have phrased the gratitude, to the Giver of all Good, that\r\nthrilled their souls? Ah, no! They could only kiss and be happy.\r\n\r\nIn the court-room without it was very evident that, for a time at\r\nleast, there need not be any hope of doing business. Even after Lem\r\nhad been silenced,--thanks not to the two sedate officers but to\r\nlittle Ruth, who had by this time regained all her authority--there\r\nwas still kept up such a buzz of conversation, interchange of\r\nejaculations and comments, breaking out afresh in one place as soon as\r\nquelled in another, lulling for an instant and then recommencing with\r\neven greater vigor, that the judge and prosecuting attorney pantomimed\r\nto each other that there might just as well be an adjournment until\r\nthe afternoon. And after the prosecutor had laid his little sacrifice\r\nupon the altar of form, in a statement, audible only to those at his\r\nelbows, that he would not be ready until afternoon to go on with the\r\nnext case upon the docket, the judge ordered an adjournment and\r\nretired to his room.\r\n\r\n\"Well, young folks,\" he said cheerily, finding the lovers in each\r\nother's arms, of course, \"you seem to be enjoying yourselves!\"\r\n\r\nMary blushed and hung her head, but Dorn looked up manfully and\r\nreplied, with a glad ring in his voice:\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes, sir! I cannot tell you how happy we feel! But you, sir, may\r\nbe able to know what is in the heart of a man who has been very close\r\nto a shameful death, for a crime of which he was innocent, and who is\r\nsuddenly restored to life, and hope, and the love of the woman who is\r\ndearer to him than all the world beside.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my boy,\" responded the good-hearted judge warmly, shaking his\r\nhand. \"Yes, I do appreciate your feelings; and while congratulating\r\nyou on the fortunate end of your trial, join you most heartily in\r\nthanking God that another has not been added to the already too long\r\nlist of melancholy proofs of the fallibility of human wisdom in the\r\nadministration of justice. But it was a providential thing for you\r\nthat Mr. Holden arrived when he did, just in the nick of time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed it was, sir. I had ceased to hope for his coming. I would like\r\nto see him before he goes away, to offer him my thanks.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you shall. Right away, if you wish.\" And stepping to the door the\r\njudge called in the little elderly gentleman, who came looking as\r\nradiant with pleasure, almost, as if it had been himself who had just\r\nescaped the gallows.\r\n\r\nAfter shaking hands with Dorn, congratulating him, and receiving his\r\nthanks, Mr. Holden addressed himself to Mary and, with old-time\r\ncourtesy and gallantry, made her a pretty little speech of compliment.\r\n\r\n\"You young folks intend to get married, don't you?\" suddenly and\r\nbluntly asked the judge.\r\n\r\nMary flushed red as a peony, but smiled, and Dorn, too, felt the color\r\nrising in his cheeks as he replied, half laughingly:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, if Mary doesn't change her mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is that, Mary?\" demanded the judge. \"Have you any notion of\r\nchanging your mind?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, sir,\" answered the girl timidly, and with an affectionate\r\nglance at Dorn.\r\n\r\n\"I should think not, from the way I found you when I came in,\" added\r\nthe judge mischievously. \"Well, you know what Franklin says, 'never\r\nput off until to-morrow what can be done to-day.' Why not get the\r\nbusiness over right away, and complete the happiness of your day.\r\nStand right out there before me and I'll soon--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, sir,\" exclaimed Mary, in a half-frightened way, \"Please, no,\r\nsir. I promised Ruth that we would wait for her and Lem, and we are\r\nall to stand up together.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, indeed! Well where are your friends Ruth and her lover? They\r\nought to be here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think they are in the court-room outside,\" volunteered Mr. Holden.\r\n\"At least they were there a few moments ago, when I came in here. I\r\nhave the pleasure of knowing Mr. Pawlett, and can guess the relations\r\nbetween him and a very pretty little girl sitting beside him.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know Lem?\" exclaimed Dorn.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he hunted me up in New York, and it was at his instance that I\r\ncame here to give my testimony.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he didn't tell me a word about it when he came back; did not even\r\ncome to see me--left me to imagine that he had not succeeded in\r\nfinding you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, he followed my instructions somewhat too literally. I advised him\r\nnot to tell anybody, but I did not exactly mean that he should not\r\nmention it to you. Still, the fault, if any exists, is mine. And it's\r\nall right now.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right? Oh, sir, how can I ever sufficiently thank you and him for\r\nwhat you have done?\"\r\n\r\n\"You need not mind thanking me any more; and as for him, I guess he\r\nwill consider the obligation squared if you facilitate his matrimonial\r\nprojects by calling in him and his sweetheart, and carrying out the\r\njudge's suggestion for immediate action.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, by all means,\" urged the judge, \"call them in, and let us have a\r\nwholesale hymenial tournament at once.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Holden looked out into the court-room, which was by this time\r\nalmost emptied. Lem and Ruth were still there, however, and sturdy Mr.\r\nMerriwether, of New Haven, who was talking to Mr. Dunn; and three or\r\nfour loiterers near the door; and a man who sat at the prosecutor's\r\ntable, and bent over it, his head resting upon his arms.\r\n\r\n\"Come in here, Mr. Pawlett, and bring the young lady with you!\" called\r\nMr. Holden. \"And step this way, if you please, Mr. Dunn, and your\r\nfriend.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the persons thus indicated came forward, the loiterers at the\r\ndoor, seeing no chance of their being included in the invitation, went\r\naway. When Dorn had passed through another torrent of congratulations,\r\nthe judge genially resumed the direction of affairs.\r\n\r\n\"Come!\" said he. \"When justice gets hold of a man, she cannot let him\r\ngo scot free, even if he is innocent. Something must be done to him.\r\nIf we can't hang him, we must at least marry him. And as you young\r\nfolks, Lemuel Pawlett and Ruth--I haven't yet been told the rest of\r\nyour name, Miss.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ruth Lenox, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ruth Lenox, eh? A very pretty name--almost worthy of so pretty an\r\nowner. Very well; as you, Lem Pawlett--and you, Ruth Lenox, have\r\nconfessedly aided and comforted Dorn Hackett in evading the fate that\r\na very blind justice had marked out for him, it is deemed right and\r\nproper that you should suffer with him.\"\r\n\r\nLem and Ruth, knowing nothing of what had transpired before they\r\nentered the room, and not half understanding the judge's rapid and\r\nsomewhat figurative language, looked very much puzzled and even a\r\nlittle alarmed.\r\n\r\nMary led her friend to one side, and the two girls held a little\r\nwhispered consultation together, from which they returned blushing,\r\nbut apparently resigned, for each placed herself beside her lover.\r\nThen the two couples ranged themselves in order before the judge, who,\r\ndropping his jocose manner, and with the gravity befitting so solemn a\r\nceremonial as that of uniting two human lives \"until death does them\r\npart,\" proceeded to make the lovers husbands and wives.\r\n\r\nThen the judge resumed his jovial mood, and claimed as his fees the\r\nfirst kiss from each of the brides, and Mr. Holden and Mr. Merriwether\r\nfollowed suit, and Mr. Dunn was very certain not to let himself be\r\nforgotten when any such fun as that was going on. There was a great\r\ndeal of hand-shaking, and expression of kind thoughts and good wishes\r\nall around. And amid all this happiness nobody noticed for some little\r\ntime that the man, whom Mr. Holden had seen bowed over the\r\nprosecutor's table, had arisen, come forward, and was standing in the\r\ndoor. A weak, trembling old man he was, with thin, deeply furrowed\r\nface, and a sad, weary look in his eyes. It was Peter Van Deust.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose,\" said he, speaking in a slow, meditative way, and with a\r\nweak, quavering voice, \"that I have no right to come here as a\r\nkill-joy among you. Love and youth were done with me long ago. The\r\nfirst I drove from me, and the second left me. I can no more call back\r\none than the other, now. If Jacob were alive to-day, he'd be more at\r\nhome among you than I am.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment, sighed deeply, passed a tremulous hand over his\r\neyes, that were full of tears, and continued:\r\n\r\n\"But I feel as if I ought to speak to you, to two of you at least,\r\nand--beg your forgiveness. I erred, and I'm sorry. I ain't what I used\r\nto be; my head's failing me, a little, sometimes, I guess. But they've\r\ngot the right man now, haven't they? They've got him at last! And\r\nthey'll hang him, won't they?\"\r\n\r\nHis voice was becoming momentarily more shrill, and his manner more\r\nexcited. Mr. Holden took his hand with a gentle, sympathetic pressure\r\nthat seemed to recall him to himself, and in a lower tone, half-choked\r\nby a sob, the poor old man exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you don't know how I miss Jacob! I didn't know how much he was to\r\nme, how much we had grown together, until I lost him! He was so good,\r\nso kind! Ah! If I had been more like him, people would feel for me now\r\nmore than they do. But it has taken me all my life to learn that love\r\nis better than gold.\"\r\n\r\nSadly and slowly he turned and moved away, through the deserted\r\ncourt-room and the crowded street--lonely alike in both--to his\r\ndesolate home, from which, thereafter, he was seldom seen abroad. But\r\nthe lesson that it had taken him all his life to learn, he did not\r\nforget; for, when they laid him down by Jacob's dust--ere again the\r\ntrailing arbutus put forth its fragrant blossoms beneath the dead\r\nleaves of the forest--and read his will, they found that he had left\r\nall he possessed to Mary Wallace, \"for the sake of the kindly love my\r\ndear brother Jacob bore for her in memory of her mother.\"\r\n\r\nWhat need can be to say the rest? how justice laid her heavy hand\r\nupon profligate young Silas Thatcher, and his doom was that his\r\nfather had foretold; how Dorn entered into partnership with Mr.\r\nMerriwether, who proved his staunch and life-long friend; how faithful\r\nLem Pawlett flourished, and how happy Ruth and Mary were. The interest\r\nof our story is done. Even justice, good deeds, calm joys, and placid\r\nlives are tame to tell.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[5] Copyright, 1888, BELFORD, CLARKE & CO.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes:\r\n\r\nObvious typographical errors have been repaired, but archaic spellings\r\nand grammatical usages have been retained.\r\n\r\nBoth \"have'nt\" and \"haven't\" were used in the text--standardized to\r\n\"haven't.\"\r\n\r\nBoth \"its\" and \"it's\" were used for \"it is\" in the text--standardized\r\nto \"it's.\"\r\n\r\nP. 408-409, \"who, like you, have no without a blush for what they\r\nare\"; the page break was after \"no\", with possible loss of content,\r\nmaking this sentence difficult to interpret.",
