P. H. BRYCE, M. A., M. D.\r\n\r\nChief Medical Officer of the Indian Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. By Order in Council dated Jan. 22nd, 1904, the writer was\r\nappointed Medical Inspector to the Department of the Interior and of\r\nIndian Affairs, and was entrusted with the health interests of the\r\nIndians of Canada. The Order in Council recites:--\r\n\r\n“The undersigned has the honour to report that there is urgent\r\nnecessity for the appointment of a medical inspector to represent the\r\nDepartment of the Interior and Department of Indian Affairs. The\r\nundersigned believes that the qualifications for the position above\r\nmentioned are possessed in an eminent degree by Mr. Peter Henderson\r\nBryce, M. D., at present and for a number of years past Secretary for\r\nthe Provincial Board of Health of Ontario, and who has had large\r\nexperience in connection with the public health of the province.”\r\n\r\n  (Signed)    Clifford Sifton,\r\n           Minister of the Interior and\r\n           Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\r\n\r\nFor the first months after the writer’s appointment he was much\r\nengaged in organizing the medical inspection of immigrants at the\r\nsea ports; but he early began the systematic collection of health\r\nstatistics of the several hundred Indian Bands scattered over Canada.\r\nFor each year up to 1914 he wrote an annual report on the health of\r\nthe Indians, published in the Departmental report, and on instructions\r\nfrom the minister made in 1907 a special inspection of thirty-five\r\nIndian schools in the three prairie provinces. This report was\r\npublished separately; but the recommendations contained in the\r\nreport were never published and the public knows nothing of them. It\r\ncontained a brief history of the origin of the Indian Schools, of the\r\nsanitary condition of the schools and statistics of the health of the\r\npupils, during the 15 years of their existence. Regarding the health\r\nof the pupils, the report states that 24 per cent. of all the pupils\r\nwhich had been in the schools were known to be dead, while of one\r\nschool on the File Hills reserve, which gave a complete return to\r\ndate, 75 per cent. were dead at the end of the 16 years since the\r\nschool opened.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Recommendations of school report 1907.]\r\n\r\nBriefly the recommendations urged, (1) Greater school facilities,\r\nsince only 30 per cent. of the children of school age were in\r\nattendance; (2) That boarding schools with farms attached be\r\nestablished near the home reserves of the pupils; (3) That the\r\ngovernment undertake the complete maintenance and control of the\r\nschools, since it had promised by treaty to insure such; and\r\nfurther it was recommended that as the Indians grow in wealth and\r\nintelligence they should pay at least part of the cost from their\r\nown funds; (4) That the school studies be those of the curricula of\r\nthe several Provinces in which the schools are situated, since it\r\nwas assumed that as the bands would soon become enfranchised and\r\nbecome citizens of the Province they would enter into the common\r\nlife and duties of a Canadian community; (5) That in view of the\r\nhistorical and sentimental relations between the Indian schools and\r\nthe Christian churches the report recommended that the Department\r\nprovide for the management of the schools, through a Board of\r\nTrustees, one appointed from each church and approved by the minister\r\nof the Department. Such a board would have its secretary in the\r\nDepartment but would hold regular meetings, establish qualifications\r\nfor teachers, and oversee the appointments as well as the control of\r\nthe schools; (6) That Continuation schools be arranged for on the\r\nschool farms and that instruction methods similar to those on the\r\nFile Hills farm colony be developed; (7) That the health interests\r\nof the pupils be guarded by a proper medical inspection and that the\r\nlocal physicians be encouraged through the provision at each school of\r\nfresh air methods in the care and treatment of cases of tuberculosis.\r\n\r\nII. The annual medical reports from year to year made reference to\r\nthe unsatisfactory health of the pupils, while different local\r\nmedical officers urged greater action in view of the results of their\r\nexperience from year to year. As the result of one such report the\r\nMinister instructed the writer in 1909 to investigate the health of\r\nthe children in the schools of the Calgary district in a letter\r\ncontaining the following:--\r\n\r\n“As it is necessary that these residential schools should be filled\r\nwith a healthy class of pupils in order that the expenditure on\r\nIndian education may not be rendered entirely nugatory, it seems\r\ndesirable that you should go over the same ground as Dr. Lafferty and\r\ncheck his inspection.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Recommendations based upon examination of 243 school children.]\r\n\r\nThese instructions were encouraging and the writer gladly undertook\r\nthe work of examining with Dr. J. D. Lafferty the 243 children of 8\r\nschools in Alberta, with the following results:--\r\n\r\n(a) Tuberculosis was present equally in children at every age; (b) In\r\nno instance was a child awaiting admission to school found free from\r\ntuberculosis; hence it was plain that infection was got in the home\r\nprimarily; (c) The disease showed an excessive mortality in the\r\npupils between five and ten years of age; (d) The 10,000 children of\r\nschool age demanded the same attention as the thousand children\r\ncoming up each year and entering the schools annually.\r\n\r\nRecommendations, made in this report, on much the same lines as those\r\nmade in the report of 1907, followed the examination of the 243\r\nchildren; but owing to the active opposition of Mr. D. C. Scott, and\r\nhis advice to the then Deputy Minister, no action was taken by the\r\nDepartment to give effect to the recommendations made. This too was\r\nin spite of the opinion of Prof. George Adami, Pathologist of McGill\r\nUniversity, in reply to a letter of the Deputy Minister asking his\r\nopinion regarding the management and conduct of the Indian schools.\r\nProf. Adami had with the writer examined the children in one of the\r\nlargest schools and was fully informed as to the actual situation. He\r\nstated that it was only after the earnest solicitation of Mr. D. C.\r\nScott that the whole matter of Dr. Bryce’s report was prevented\r\nfrom becoming a matter of critical discussion at the annual meeting\r\nof the National Tuberculosis Association in 1910, of which he was\r\nthen president, and this was only due to Mr. Scott’s distinct\r\npromise that the Department would take adequate action along the\r\nlines of the report. Prof. Adami stated in his letter to the Deputy\r\nMinister:--\r\n\r\n“It was a revelation to me to find tuberculosis prevailing to such\r\nan extent amongst these children, and as many of them were only\r\nsuffering from the early incipient form of the disease, though\r\npractically everyone was affected, when under care it may be\r\narrested, I was greatly impressed with the responsibility of the\r\ngovernment in dealing with these children.... I can assure you my\r\nonly motive is a great sympathy for these children, who are the wards\r\nof the government and cannot protect themselves from the ravages of\r\nthis disease.”\r\n\r\nIII. In reviewing his correspondence the writer finds a personal\r\nletter, written by him to the Minister dated March 16th, 1911,\r\nfollowing an official letter regarding the inaction of the Department\r\nwith regard to the recommendations of the report. This letter refers\r\nto the most positive promises of Mr. D. C. Scott that the Department\r\nwould at once take steps to put the suggestions contained in the\r\nreport into effect. The letter further says:--\r\n\r\n“It is now over 9 months since these occurrences and I have not\r\nreceived a single communication with reference to carrying out the\r\nsuggestions of our report. Am I wrong in assuming that the vanity of\r\nMr. D. C. Scott, growing out of his success at manipulating the\r\nmental activities of Mr. Pedley, has led him to the fatal deception\r\nof supposing that his cleverness will be equal to that of Prospero in\r\ncalming any storm that may blow up from a Tuberculosis Association or\r\nany where else, since he knows that should he fail he has through\r\nmemoranda on file placed the responsibility on Mr. Pedley and\r\nyourself. In this particular matter, he is counting upon the\r\nignorance and indifference of the public to the fate of the Indians;\r\nbut with the awakening of the health conscience of the people, we are\r\nnow seeing on every hand, I feel certain that serious trouble will\r\ncome out of departmental inertia, and I am not personally disposed to\r\nhave any blame fall upon me.”\r\n\r\nIt will then be understood with what pleasure the writer hailed the\r\nappointment of Dr. W. A. Roche as Superintendent General of Indian\r\nAffairs after the year’s term of the Hon. R. Rogers, whose chief\r\nactivity was the investigation of the Deputy Minister, which led up\r\nto his retirement. Now at last he said, “A medical minister exists\r\nwho would understand the situation as relates to the health of the\r\nIndians.” So an early opportunity was taken to set forth in a\r\nmemorandum to Dr. Roche, dated Dec. 9th, 1912, data and statistics\r\nrelating to the several hundred scattered bands on whose health the\r\ntotal expenditure was but little more than $2 per capita, while the\r\ndeath rate in many of the bands was as high as forty per thousand.\r\nThe reply acknowledging receipt of this memorandum contained the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dr. Roche is urged to act.]\r\n\r\n“There is certainly something in your suggestion that should meet\r\nwith every consideration, and some time when I can find an\r\nopportunity and it is convenient for you, I shall be pleased to\r\ndiscuss this matter with you.” As Dr. Roche became ill and was\r\nabsent for some months nothing further was done; but on his return\r\nthe writer in a personal interview urged that this serious medical\r\nIndian problem be taken up in earnest. It was stated that medical\r\nscience now knows just what to do and what was necessary was to put\r\nour knowledge into practice. Dr. Roche stated that on his return from\r\nthe West he would certainly take the matter up. Since that moment\r\nhowever, to the present, the matter has awaited the promised action.\r\n\r\nThe writer had done no regular inspection work since Mr. D. C. Scott\r\nwas made Deputy minister in 1913, but had in each year up to 1914\r\nprepared his medical report, printed in the annual report of the\r\nDepartment. About this time the following letter was received:--\r\n\r\n  P. H. Bryce, M. D.\r\n  Medical Inspector,\r\n  Immigration Branch.\r\n                            Ottawa,\r\n                      June 17, 1914.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nIn reply to your letter of the first instant, asking that the files\r\nof the Department, containing our medical officers’ reports be\r\nplaced at your disposal, so that you may peruse them to enable you to\r\nfurnish a report for publication, I desire to point out, that by the\r\norganization of this Department, under the Civil Service Act of 1908\r\nyou were not included therein and since that time your whole salary\r\nhas been a charge against the Department of the Interior. It is true\r\nthat since then we have availed ourselves of your services on a few\r\noccasions; but during the past year, so far as I am aware, you have\r\nnot been called upon to do any duty for the Department. I may say\r\nalso that Dr. Grain of Winnipeg, has lately been appointed to oversee\r\nthe Western schools and reserves and his time is fully occupied in\r\nthe work. Under these circumstances, I do not think that you should\r\nbe asked to furnish a report on the medical work in connection with\r\nIndians during the fiscal year. I must thank you cordially for the\r\noffer to again prepare a report for publication.\r\n\r\n  Yours sincerely,\r\n    Duncan C. Scott,\r\n      D. S. G. I. A.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Scott’s malign influence.]\r\n\r\nThe transparent hypocrisy contained in this remarkable communication\r\nsent, not by the Minister Dr. W. A. Roche, but by his deputy, will\r\nbe seen in the fact that from 1908, five annual reports had been\r\nprepared by the writer, while the special report on the eight schools\r\nof the Calgary district with the recommendations already referred to\r\nhad been made on the instructions of the Department in 1909. The\r\nother reason given, to the effect that a certain physician, since\r\nretired for good cause, quite inexperienced in dealing with Indian\r\ndisease problems, had been appointed as Medical Inspector for the\r\nWestern Provinces, showed how little the Minister cared for the\r\nsolution of the tuberculosis problem. As a matter of fact the Order\r\nin Council appointing the writer had neither been changed nor\r\nrescinded, while the transfer to the Interior Department of the\r\npayment of the total salary was made in 1908 in order that his\r\nregular increase of pay under the new classification of the Civil\r\nService Act of that year might be made.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dr. Roche’s culpable apathy.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Value of man power of Indians.]\r\n\r\nIV. As the war broke out in 1914 and immigration was largely\r\nsuspended, an unexpected opportunity occurred through the greater\r\ntime at his disposal for the writer’s special knowledge and\r\nexperience to be utilised in improving the health of the Indians; but\r\nin no single instance, thereafter, were the services of the writer\r\nutilised by this medical Minister, who in 1917 was transferred to\r\npreside over the Civil Service Commission, and who must be held\r\nresponsible for the neglect of what proved to be a very serious\r\nsituation. In 1917, the writer prepared, at the request of the\r\nConservation Commission, a pamphlet on “The Conservation of the Man\r\nPower of Canada,” which dealt with the broad problems of health\r\nwhich so vitally affect the man power of a nation. The large demand\r\nfor this pamphlet led to the preparation of a similar study on “The\r\nConservation of the Man Power of the Indian Population of Canada,”\r\nwhich had already supplied over 2000 volunteer soldiers for the\r\nEmpire. For obvious reasons this memorandum was not published, but\r\nwas placed in the hands of a minister of the Crown in 1918, in order\r\nthat all the facts might be made known to the Government. This\r\nmemorandum began by pointing out that in 1916 4,862,303 acres were\r\nincluded in the Indian reserves and that 73,716 acres were then under\r\ncultivation; that while the total per capita income for farm crops in\r\nthat year in all Canada was $110, that from the Indian reserves was\r\n$69, while it was only $40 for Nova Scotia. It is thus obvious that\r\nfrom the lowest standard of wealth producers the Indian population of\r\nCanada was already a matter of much importance to the State. From the\r\nstatistics given in the “Man Power” pamphlet it was made plain\r\nthat instead of the normal increase in the Indian population being\r\n1.5 per cent. per annum as given for the white population, there had\r\nbeen between 1904 and 1917 an actual decrease in the Indian\r\npopulation in the age period over twenty years of 1,639 persons\r\nwhereas a normal increase would have added 20,000 population in the\r\n13 years. The comparisons showed that the loss was almost wholly due\r\nto a high death rate since, though incomplete, the Indian birth rate\r\nwas 27 per thousand or higher than the average for the whole white\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nThe memorandum states, “As the Indian people are an unusually\r\nstrong native race, their children at birth are large and sturdy, and\r\nunder good sanitary conditions have a low mortality. Thus of the 134\r\nchildren born in the File Hills Farm Colony in 17 years only 34 died,\r\nwhile of 15 births in 1916 only 1 died, giving the unusually low rate\r\nof 77 per thousand within the year.”\r\n\r\nAs it was further desirable to obtain the latest returns of deaths by\r\nage periods and causes the writer communicated with the Secretary of\r\nthe Indian Department asking for such returns. In reply he received\r\nthe following letter:--\r\n\r\n          Ottawa, May 7, 1918.\r\n\r\nDear Dr. Bryce,\r\n\r\nI have your letter of the third instant asking for certain vital\r\nstatistics. I am unable to give you the figures you ask as we are not\r\nreceiving any vital statistics now, and last year we obtained only\r\nthe total number of births and deaths from each Agency. These were\r\nnot printed and are not therefore available for distribution. The\r\ncauses of deaths have never been noted in our reports and we have no\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n  Your obedient servant,\r\n      (Signed) J. D. McLean,\r\n            Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Entire absence of causes of deaths.]\r\n\r\nThus after more than a hundred years of an organized Department of\r\nIndian Affairs in Canada, though the writer had at once begun in 1904\r\non his appointment the regular collection of statistics of diseases\r\nand deaths from the several Indian bands, he was officially informed\r\nthat in a Department with 287 paid medical officers, due to the\r\ndirect reactionary influence of the former Accountant and present\r\nDeputy Minister no means exists, such as is looked upon as elementary\r\nin any Health Department today, by which the public or the Indians\r\nthemselves can learn anything definite as to the actual vital\r\nconditions amongst these wards of the nation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The famous File Hills Farm colony.]\r\n\r\nA study of the 1916-17 statistics shows that in the wage earning\r\nperiod of life, from 21 to 65 years, the Indians of Alberta had 161\r\nless population, of British Columbia 901 less, of Ontario 991 less\r\nand of Nova Scotia 399 less. In order however to show how an Indian\r\npopulation may increase, the writer obtained from Mr. W. M. Graham,\r\nat that time Superintendent of the File Hills colony from 1901 to\r\n1917, the complete record for this period. In all there were 53\r\ncolonists from the neighbouring Indian schools, starting with five in\r\n1901, who had taken up homesteads in the colony. Most of them married\r\nalthough 15 either left or had died previous to marriage. In June\r\n1917 there were resident 38 men, 26 women and 106 children, or\r\n170 colonists in all. Thus we have the picture of a young Indian\r\npopulation of 49 males who remained in the colony, of whom 10 died of\r\ntuberculosis after an average sickness there of 2.7 years and of 29\r\nfemales of whom 3 died and to whom had been born in all 134 children.\r\nIn 1916 the colony had 3,991 acres under cultivation or over a\r\nhundred acres per farmer. This was one nineteenth of the total area\r\ncultivated by 105,000 persons in all the Indian bands in Canada,\r\nwhile 87,498 bushels of grain were grown, and 33,052 head of live\r\nstock were kept. That this variation from the normal is viewed as\r\nan anomaly may be judged from the following extract from the Deputy\r\nMinister’s Annual Report for 1917; “The Indian population does\r\nnot vary much from year to year.” How misleading this statement is\r\nmay be judged from the fact that between 1906 and 1917 in the age\r\nperiods over 20 years in every Province but two the Indians had\r\ndecreased in population by a total of 2,632 deaths.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Extraordinary mortality from tuberculosis.]\r\n\r\nNaturally it is asked; Why this decrease should have taken place? In\r\n1906 the report of the Chief Medical Officer shows that statistics\r\ncollected from 99 local medical officers having the care of a\r\npopulation of 70,000 gave a total of 3,169 cases of tuberculosis or\r\n1 case for every seven in a total of 23,109 diseases reported, and\r\nthe death rates in several large bands were 81.8, 82.6, and in a\r\nthird 86.4 per thousand; while the ordinary death rate for 115,000 in\r\nthe city of Hamilton was 10.6 in 1921. What these figures disclose\r\nhas been made more plain year by year, namely that tuberculosis,\r\ncontracted in infancy, creates diseases of the brain, joints, bones,\r\nand to a less degree of the lungs and also that if not fatal till\r\nadolescence it then usually progresses rapidly to a fatal termination\r\nin consumption of the lungs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The amazing reduction of tuberculosis in Hamilton.]\r\n\r\nThe memorandum prepared by the writer in 1918 further showed that the\r\ncity of Hamilton with a population greater than the total Indian\r\npopulation had reduced the death rate from tuberculosis in the same\r\nperiod, from 1904 to 1917, by nearly 75 per cent. having in 1916\r\nactually only 68 deaths. The memorandum further states, “If a\r\nsimilar method had been introduced amongst the bands on the\r\nhealth-giving uplands of Alberta, much might have been done to\r\nprevent such a splendid race of warriors as the Blackfeet from\r\ndecreasing from 842 in 1904 to 726 in 1916, or, allowing for natural\r\nincrease, an actual loss of 40 per cent. since they should have\r\nnumbered at least 1,011.”\r\n\r\nV. Such then is the situation made known to the Hon. N. W. Rowell,\r\nwho applied to the writer in 1918 to supply him with such facts and\r\narguments as would support the Bill he proposed to introduce into\r\nParliament for the creation of a Federal Department of Health.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Occult influences again rob the Indians of a chance.]\r\n\r\nIt was with pleasure that the memorandum dealing with Indian health\r\nmatters was given him, along with a proposed Bill for a Department of\r\nHealth, which contained amongst its provisions one for including the\r\nIndian Medical Service along with the other Medical Federal services\r\nin the new Department. In the special medical committee called by Mr.\r\nRowell to discuss the Bill, such inclusion was of course approved of\r\nand the clause appeared in the First Reading in Parliament. But\r\nsomething then happened: What special occult influences came into\r\naction may be imagined, when the Second Reading of the Bill took\r\nplace with this clause regarding the Indian Medical Service omitted.\r\nIt has been noted that from 1913 up to the time when Dr. W. A. Roche\r\nwas eliminated from the government in 1917 to make room for a more\r\nhardy and subtle representative of Unionism the activities of the\r\nChief Medical Inspector of the Indian Department, had in practice\r\nceased; yet now he was to see as the outcome of all this health\r\nlegislation for which he had been struggling for years, the failure\r\nof one of his special health dreams, which he has hoped to see\r\nrealized.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: One who failed them in their agony.]\r\n\r\nIf the writer had been much disturbed by the incapacity or inertia of\r\na medical Minister in the matter of the Indian health situation, he\r\nnow saw that it was hopeless to expect any improvement in it when the\r\nnew Minister of Health, who had posed as the Bayard of Social Uplift,\r\nthe Protagonist of Prohibition, the Champion of Oppressed Labour, the\r\nSir Galahad of Women’s rights, and the _preux Chevalier_ of Canadian\r\nNationalism, could with all the accumulated facts and statistics\r\nbefore him condemn to further indefinite suffering and neglect these\r\nWards of the Canadian people, whom one Government after another had\r\nmade treaties with and whom deputies and officials had sworn to\r\nassist and protect.\r\n\r\nA side light however, may serve to illumine the beclouded situation.\r\nWith the formation of the Unionist Government the usual shuffle of\r\nportfolios was made and the then dominating Solicitor General, grown\r\ncallous and hardened over a franchise Bill, which disfranchised many\r\nthousands of his fellow native-born citizens, had now become Minister\r\nof the Interior. That the desire for power and for the control\r\nappointments should override any higher consideration such as\r\nsaving the lives of the Indians must be inferred from the following\r\nstatement of the Hon. A. Meighen, Minister of the Interior and now\r\nPrime Minister. On June 8th, 1920, the estimates of the Indian\r\nDepartment were under consideration in Parliament. Page 3275 of\r\nHansard has the following:--\r\n\r\nMr. D. D. McKenzie, “I understand that frightful ravages are being\r\nmade amongst them (Indians) by tuberculosis and the conditions of\r\nlife are certainly not such as to preserve them from the ravages of\r\nthat dread disease. I should be pleased to know at the earliest\r\npossible moment if that branch of the Department was going to be\r\ntransferred to the Department of Health.”\r\n\r\nMr. Meighen, “The Health Department has no power to take over the\r\nmatter of the health of the Indians. That is not included in the Act\r\nestablishing the department. It was purposely left out of the Act. I\r\ndid not then think and do not think yet that it would be practicable\r\nfor the Health Department to do that work, because they would require\r\nto duplicate the organization away in the remote regions, where\r\nIndian reserves are, and there would be established a sort of divided\r\ncontrol and authority over the Indians.”\r\n\r\nMr. Beland, “Is tuberculosis increasing or decreasing amongst the\r\nIndians?”\r\n\r\nMr. Meighen, “I am afraid I cannot give a very encouraging answer\r\nto the question. We are not convinced that it is increasing, but it\r\nis not decreasing.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Red tape condemns the Indians because of a pitiable\r\ninertia.]\r\n\r\nIn this reply of the Minister we see fully illustrated the dominating\r\ninfluence, stimulated by the reactionary Deputy Minister, which\r\nprevents even the simplest effective efforts to deal with the health\r\nproblem of the Indians along modern scientific lines. To say that\r\nconfusion would arise is the equivalent of saying that co-operation\r\nbetween persons toward a desired social end is impracticable; whereas\r\nco-operation between Provincial and Federal Health Departments is the\r\nbasis upon which real progress is being made, while further a world\r\npeace is being made possible in a league of once discordant nations.\r\nThe Premier has frankly said he can give no encouraging answer to Dr.\r\nBeland’s question, while at the same moment he condemns the Indians\r\nto their fate by a pitiable confession of utter official helplessness\r\nand lack of initiative, based upon a cynical “non possumus.”\r\n\r\nThus we find a sum of only $10,000 has been annually placed in the\r\nestimates to control tuberculosis amongst 105,000 Indians scattered\r\nover Canada in over 300 bands, while the City of Ottawa, with about\r\nthe same population and having three general hospitals spent thereon\r\n$342,860.54 in 1919 of which $33,364.70 is devoted to tuberculous\r\npatients alone. The many difficulties of our problem amongst the\r\nIndians have been frequently pointed out, but the means to cope with\r\nthese have also been made plain. It can only be said that any cruder\r\nor weaker arguments by a Prime Minister holding the position of\r\nresponsibility to these treaty wards of Canada could hardly be\r\nconceived, and such recall the satirical jibe of Voltaire, regarding\r\nthe Treaty of Shackmaxon between Wm. Penn and the Indians, which he\r\ndescribes as “the only known treaty between savages and Christians\r\nthat was never sworn to and never broken.”\r\n\r\nThe degree and extent of this criminal disregard for the treaty\r\npledges to guard the welfare of the Indian wards of the nation may\r\nbe gauged from the facts once more brought out at the meeting of\r\nthe National Tuberculosis Association at its annual meeting held in\r\nOttawa on March 17th, 1922. The superintendent of the Qu’Appelle\r\nSanatorium, Sask., gave there the results of a special study of 1575\r\nchildren of school age in which advantage was taken of the most\r\nmodern scientific methods. Of these 175 were Indian children, and it\r\nis very remarkable that the fact given that some 93 per cent. of\r\nthese showed evidence of tuberculous infection coincides completely\r\nwith the work done by Dr. Lafferty and the writer in the Alberta\r\nIndian schools in 1909.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed pitiable that during the thirteen years since then this\r\ntrail of disease and death has gone on almost unchecked by any\r\nserious efforts on the part of the Department of Indian Affairs,\r\nplaced by the B. N. A. Act especially in charge of our Indian\r\npopulation, and that a Provincial Tuberculosis Commission now\r\nconsiders it to be its duty to publish the facts regarding these\r\nchildren living within its own Province.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis story should have been written years ago and then given to\r\nthe public; but in my oath of office as a Civil Servant swore that\r\n“without authority on that behalf, I shall not disclose or make\r\nknown any matter or thing which comes to my knowledge by reason of\r\nmy employment as Chief Medical Inspector of Indian Affairs.” Today I\r\nam free to speak, having been retired from the Civil Service and so\r\nam in a position to write the sequel to the story. It has already\r\nbeen stated that in 1918 and 1919 I had supplied to my then Minister\r\nof Immigration, the Hon. J. A. Calder and to the then President of\r\nthe Council, the Hon. N. W. Rowell various memoranda regarding\r\nthe establishment of a Federal Department of Health, amongst these\r\nbeing a draft of the Bill which later became the Act establishing the\r\nDepartment of Health. To my disappointment the position of Deputy\r\nMinister of Health to which I had a right to aspire after twenty-two\r\nyears as Chief Medical Officer of Ontario, and fifteen years as\r\nChief Medical Officer of Immigration and Indian Affairs was given to\r\nanother, wholly outside the Federal Civil Service and in violation\r\nof the principle of promotion, which was supposed to prevail when\r\nthe patronage system was to be done away with. The excuse was on the\r\nground of my advancing years, although at that moment the position\r\nof Auditor General was being filled by the promotion of one who had\r\nreached sixty-five years, while a Historian to the Militia Department\r\nwas appointed at a salary of $7,000 per year, who likewise had\r\nreached just then this age.\r\n\r\nNaturally I felt that it would be impossible to carry on and retain\r\nmy self respect as a subordinate, while performing the duties, which\r\nI had been engaged in for fifteen years as Chief Medical Officer and\r\nso asked that I be given other congenial work. That my claims to the\r\nposition were deemed reasonable may be judged from the following\r\nletter addressed to my brother the Rev. Professor Bryce, D.D., of\r\nWinnipeg. Writing from Victoria, B. C., on March 9th, 1920, to myself\r\nhe said, quoting from a letter received from the Hon. Mr. Calder in\r\nreply to one of his own:--\r\n\r\n“I quite appreciate the views of your brother in reference to his\r\nsituation here, and personally would be only too glad to do anything\r\nI can to help out. When the Public Health Department was created,\r\nyour brother certainly had claims to the appointment as Deputy\r\nMinister. Owing to his advanced age however, Council finally\r\nconcluded that a younger man should receive the appointment. The\r\ngovernment has on several occasions considered the question of\r\nplacing your brother in some other branch of the Service, and I have\r\nno doubt that this will be arranged in some way or other shortly.\r\nHe is now an official of the Public Health Department. He could of\r\ncourse remain there but this apparently is not agreeable to him.\r\nAs a consequence some other arrangement, if possible must be made.\r\n\r\n  Signed, J. A. Calder.”\r\n\r\nMy indignation at subsequent treatment may be imagined when the same\r\nMr. Calder introduced the Act in 1920, commonly known as the Calder\r\nAct, providing for the “Retirement of Certain Members of the Civil\r\nService.” This Act states that anyone retired thereunder shall\r\nreceive 1/60 of his salary for each year of service. So it came about\r\nthat on the 17th Sept. 1920, I received notice that I was recommended\r\nfor retirement under this Act. The clause of the Act quoted for my\r\ninformation states:--\r\n\r\n“Section 2(3). When it is decided to retire anyone under the\r\nprovisions of this Act, notice in writing giving the reasons for such\r\nretirement shall be sent to such person, and he shall have the right\r\nto appeal to the Civil Service Commission, and the Commission, after\r\ngiving such person an opportunity to be heard, shall make full report\r\nto the Governor in Council and the decision of the Council thereon\r\nshall be final.”\r\n\r\nI appealed and in my appeal stated that no reason was assigned as\r\nprovided in the Act, and further that I was still Chief Medical\r\nOfficer in the Department of Indian Affairs as set out in the Order\r\nin Council of 1904.\r\n\r\nAs bearing on this point made in my appeal I find the following in\r\nHansard of June 8th, 1921. The matter being dealt with is the\r\namendment to the Calder Act:\r\n\r\nMr. Fielding: But cases have been brought to my attention of men in\r\nadvanced years--some may think them old, I do not--being notified of\r\ntheir retirement, although they are blessed with good health and\r\nstrength, both mental and physical, and are well able to discharge\r\ntheir duties. How is such a man dealt with?\r\n\r\nMr. Calder: No man will be notified unless a proper official has\r\nadvised that his condition of life is such that in the public\r\ninterest he should be retired....\r\n\r\nMr. Calder: That in the main has been the practice in the past and\r\nthat is what the law contemplated last year. The question of age\r\nalone was not taken into consideration.\r\n\r\nBut it was hardly to be supposed that Dr. W. A. Roche, now Chairman\r\nof the Civil Service Commission, who during the years 1913-17\r\nreferred to had failed to utilise my services when he was\r\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs would now consider my services as\r\nnecessary in that Department. So my protest was of no avail; my\r\nelimination from the Service had been decreed and I received the\r\nfollowing Order in Council:\r\n\r\n    Ottawa, 14th Feb., 1921.\r\n\r\nThe Committee have had before them a report, dated Feb. 1st, 1921,\r\nfrom the acting Secretary of State, from the Civil Service\r\nCommission:\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the provisions of Cap. 67, 10-11 George V. “An\r\nAct to provide for the Retirement of Certain Members of the Public\r\nService” the Civil Service has to report that Dr. P. H. Bryce of\r\nthe Department of Health at Ottawa was recommended by the Deputy\r\nMinister of Health for retirement; that under Section 2 (3) of the\r\nsaid Act he was given a personal hearing, which has resulted in the\r\nCivil Service Commission now recommending that his appeal be not\r\nallowed, but that his retirement be made effective from the 1st\r\nof March, 1921. Dr. Bryce was born on August 17th, 1853, and is\r\nconsequently sixty-seven years of age. He was appointed temporarily\r\nto the Service on Feb. 1st, 1904, and was made permanent on September\r\n1st, 1908, and therefore will have been in the Service seventeen\r\nyears and one month on the 1st March, 1921, the date upon which his\r\nretirement is proposed to be effective.\r\n\r\nSo it came about that I was retired in March, 1921, without any years\r\nbeing added to my term of Federal service, though I had been brought\r\nto Ottawa as an expert after 22 years in the Ontario Health Service,\r\nas is provided for in the Superannuation Act of 1870. Neither did I\r\nget any gratuity on leaving the Ontario Service after twenty-two\r\nyears, the excuse being then given that I was improving my position.\r\n\r\nThe irony and injustice of this Order in Council will be seen when it\r\nis stated that a similar Order was passed on May 18th, 1921, retiring\r\n231 persons from the Customs Department as being over sixty-five\r\nyears of age; but which was recalled when the protests of the many\r\nfriends of men who were faithfully performing their duties were made.\r\nThese and hundreds of other Civil Servants of similar age are in\r\ndifferent Departments still performing their duties.\r\n\r\nIn view, therefore, of all the facts herein recited I make my appeal\r\nfor simple justice; that I be permitted to carry on my work as Chief\r\nMedical Officer of Indian Affairs, and I believe that I have the\r\nright to demand, after a thorough investigation into all the facts\r\nof the case, that the chief obstacle, as set forth in the story, to\r\ninsuring the health and prosperity of the one hundred thousand\r\nIndians, the Wards of the nation, be removed.\r\n\r\nSince the time of Edward I. the people have ever exercised their\r\nhistoric right to lay their petitions before the King and Parliament.\r\nI now desire herein respectfully to bring my appeal for the Indians\r\nof Canada before the King’s representative and the Parliament of\r\nCanada, feeling sure that justice will be done both to them and to\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\n    P. H. BRYCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s note:\r\n\r\nMinor punctuation and hyphenation errors in the original have\r\nbeen silently corrected.\r\n\r\nA few grammatically incomplete sentences that appear to have a word\r\nmissing have been left as printed.\r\n\r\nOther corrections of spelling misprints have been recorded in HTML\r\ncomments.",
