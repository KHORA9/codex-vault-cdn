M. G. WATKINS, M.A.\r\n\r\n [Illustration]\r\n\r\n ELLIOT STOCK, 62, PATERNOSTER ROW,\r\n LONDON, E.C.\r\n 1880\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Preface to\r\n Dame Juliana Berners’ Treatyse on Fysshynge\r\n wyth an Angle.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scholarly angler is here presented with an exact _facsimile_\r\nof the first English treatise on fishing. The book is of extreme\r\ninterest for several reasons, not the least curious being that it\r\nhas served as a literary quarry to so many succeeding writers on\r\nfishing, who have not disdained to adapt the authoress’s sentiments\r\nto their own use, and even to borrow them word for word without\r\nacknowledgment. Walton himself was evidently familiar with it, and\r\nhas clearly taken his “jury of flies” from its “xij flyes wyth\r\nwhyche ye shall angle to y^e trought & grayllyng;” while Burton,\r\nthat universal plunderer, has extracted her eloquent eulogy on the\r\nsecondary pleasures of angling for incorporation with the patchwork\r\nstructure of his “Anatomy of Melancholy.” Besides giving the earliest\r\naccount of the art of fishing, the estimate which the authoress forms\r\nof the moral value of the craft is not only very high, but has served\r\nto strike the keynote for all subsequent followers of the art both\r\nin their praises and their practice of it. To this little treatise\r\nmore than to any other belongs the credit of having assigned in\r\npopular estimation to the angler his meditative and gentle nature.\r\nMany pure and noble intellects have kindled into lasting devotion\r\nto angling on reading her eloquent commendation of it. Such men as\r\nDonne, Wotton, and Herbert, Paley, Bell, and Davy, together with many\r\nanother excellent and simple disposition, have caught enthusiasm\r\nfrom her lofty sentiments, and found that not their bodily health\r\nonly, but also their morals, were improved by angling. It became a\r\nschool of virtues, a quiet pastime in which, while looking into their\r\nown hearts, they learnt lessons of the highest wisdom, reverence,\r\nresignation, and love—love of their fellow-men, of the lower\r\ncreatures, and of their Creator.\r\n\r\nNothing definite is known of the reputed authoress, Dame Juliana\r\nBarnes or Berners. She is said to have been a daughter of Sir James\r\nBerners of Roding Berners in the county of Essex, a favourite of King\r\nRichard the Second, who was beheaded in 1388 as an evil counsellor\r\nto the king and an enemy to the public weal. She was celebrated\r\nfor her extreme beauty and great learning, and is reported to have\r\nheld the office of prioress of the Benedictine Nunnery of Sopwell\r\nin Hertfordshire, a cell to the Abbey of St. Alban, but of this\r\nno documentary evidence exists. The first edition of her “Book of\r\nSt. Alban’s,” printed by the schoolmaster-printer of St. Alban’s\r\nin 1486, treats of hawking, hunting, and coat-armour. In the next\r\nedition, “Enprynted at Westmestre by Wynkyn the Worde the yere\r\nof thyncarnacōn of our lorde. M . CCCC . lxxxxvi,” among the other\r\n“treatyfes perteynynge to hawkynge & huntynge with other dyuers\r\nplaysaunt materes belongynge vnto noblesse,” appeared the present\r\ntreatise on angling. The aristocratic instincts of the authoress\r\nprompted this mode of publication, as she herself explains in the\r\nconcluding paragraph—“by cause that this present treatyse sholde not\r\ncome to the hondys of eche ydle persone whyche wolde desire it yf it\r\nwere enprynted allone by itself & put in a lytyll plaunflet, therfore\r\nI haue compylyd it in a greter volume of dyuerse bokys concernynge\r\nto gentyll & noble men to the entent that the forsayd ydle persones\r\nwhyche sholde haue but lytyll mesure in the sayd dysporte of\r\nfysshyng sholde not by this meane vtterly dystroye it.” The present\r\npublication is the “little pamphlet” which was enclosed in this\r\n“greater volume.” An edition of it as a distinct treatise appears to\r\nhave been issued by Wynkyn de Worde soon after that of 1496, with the\r\ntitle, “Here begynnyth a treatyse of fysshynge wyth an Angle” over\r\nthe curious woodcut of the man fishing which is on the first page\r\nof the present _facsimile_, but only one copy of it is known to be\r\nin existence. At least ten more editions appeared before the year\r\n1600. This shows the great popularity of the book at the time of its\r\npublication, and considering how human nature remains the same, and\r\nthe charms of angling are equally grateful to every fresh generation\r\nof anglers, affords a sufficient reason for the strong antiquarian\r\ndelight which all literary anglers of the present century have felt\r\nin the book. It is worth while briefly to trace the bibliography of\r\nangling onwards until the appearance in 1653 of Walton’s _Compleat\r\nAngler_, when the reader will be on familiar ground. In the interval\r\nof more than a hundred and fifty years between these two names of\r\nBerners and Walton, so deeply reverenced by every true scholar of\r\nthe craft, there occur but four books on angling, though each one\r\nof these possesses a fame peculiar to itself. First came Leonard\r\nMascall’s _Booke of Fishing with Hooke and Line_, published in 1590.\r\nTaverner’s Certaine _Experiments concerning Fish and Fruite_ followed\r\nin 1600. Then came in 1613 the _Secrets of Angling_ of the celebrated\r\nangling poet, J. D. [John Dennys], whose verses have perhaps never\r\nyet been surpassed; and finally, in 1651, appeared Barker’s _Art of\r\nAngling_. With this fisherman and “ambassador’s cook,” as he calls\r\nhimself, Walton must often have conversed.\r\n\r\nIt is a further testimony to the attractions which angling has\r\nalways possessed for contemplative natures that the art appears here\r\nsystematised, so to speak, as early as the middle of the fifteenth\r\ncentury in England, where it has been practised ever since with more\r\nenthusiasm and skill than in other countries. There is a sad gap in\r\nangling literature from the days of Ausonius, at the commencement of\r\nthe fourth century, to those of Dame Juliana Berners. Fly-fishing,\r\nindeed, is not named between the time of Ælian and that of the\r\nTreatyse. It is clearly described by the former writer, who alone\r\namong the ancients mentions it, but in the present book it is spoken\r\nof under the term “angling with a dubbe,” as if it were well-known\r\nand practised. Not only so, but it is clear that the writer had books\r\nof angling lore before her, perhaps monkish manuscripts, as Hawkins\r\nsuggests, which would be of inestimable interest could they now be\r\nrecovered. Thus in speaking of the carp, the reader will find she\r\nwrites—“as touchynge his baytes I haue but lytyll knowlege of it. And\r\nme were loth to wryte more than I knowe & haue prouyd. But well I\r\nwote that the redde worme & the menow ben good baytys for hym at all\r\ntymes as I haue herde saye of persones credyble & also founde wryten\r\nin bokes of credence.” No better rules can be given for fly-fishing\r\nat present than the two which she prescribes for angling—“for the\r\nfyrste and pryncypall poynt in anglynge : kepe y^e euer fro the water\r\nfro the sighte of the fysshe,” and “also loke that ye shadow not the\r\nwater as moche as ye may.” The “troughte” is to be angled for “wyth a\r\ndubbe” [artificial fly] “in lepynge time;” but as for the salmon, “ye\r\nmay take hym : but it is seldom seen with a dubbe at suche tyme as\r\nwhan he lepith in lyke fourme & manere as ye doo take a troughte or a\r\ngryalynge.” With the imperfect tackle and clumsy rod of those days,\r\nit is no wonder that the capture of salmon with a fly, which is still\r\nthe crowning achievement of the craft, could seldom be effected.\r\n\r\nAfter the eloquent pleading for angling with which the treatise\r\nopens, the lady at once proceeds to teach the making of the “harnays”\r\nof it. The rod she orders to be constructed somewhat resembles, save\r\nin its larger size, the modern walking-stick rod. A hazel wand, or\r\nfailing it, one of willow or mountain ash, is to be procured, as\r\nthick as the arm and nine feet in length. This is to form the butt,\r\nand is to be hollowed out by means of divers red-hot irons into a\r\ntapering hole, which is to receive the “croppe,” or top, as we now\r\ncall it, when not in use. This “croppe” is to be made of a yard of\r\nhazel, joined to a length of blackthorn, crab, medlar, or “jenypre.”\r\nAll these are to be cut between Michaelmas and Candlemas, the lady\r\ngiving very particular directions as to their drying and the like.\r\nWhen the two portions of the “crop” are “fretted together,” the whole\r\nrod is to be shaved into a shapely taper form; the staff encircled\r\nwith long hoops of iron or latten at both ends, and finished with a\r\n“pyke in the nether ende fastnyd wyth a rennynge vyce : to take in\r\n& oute youre croppe.” The line is then to be wound round the crop\r\nand tied fast with a bow at the top. The reader will note that there\r\nis no mention of a reel; it was only used, seemingly until the\r\nbeginning of this century, for large salmon and pike. An angler who\r\nhooked a fish when armed with this ponderous rod (which must from\r\nits description have been nearly eighteen feet long, as large as a\r\nmodern salmon rod), would act as Izaak Walton would have done in the\r\nlike predicament,—throw the rod in to the fish and recover it when he\r\ncould. But the lady is wonderfully pleased with this mighty rod, and\r\nthus concludes—“Thus shall ye make you a rodde soo preuy that ye maye\r\nwalke therwyth : and there shall noo man wyte where abowte ye goo.\r\nIt woll be lyghte & full nymbyll to fysshe wyth at your luste. And\r\nfor the more redynesse loo here a fygure,” and she adds the curious\r\nwoodcut which the reader may see reproduced at page 5.\r\n\r\nThen follow directions how to dye and make lines and hooks. There\r\nwere evidently no manufacturers of hooks in the fifteenth century:\r\neach angler made his own. The casting of plummets and forming of\r\nfloats succeed. The six methods of angling and the mode of playing a\r\nfish are next treated, and the latter alone shows that Dame Juliana\r\nmust herself have been a proficient in the craft. No one but a\r\nthoroughly good fisher could have summed up the art of playing a\r\nfish in the words—“kepe hym euer vnder the rodde, and euermore holde\r\nhym streyghte : soo that your lyne may susteyne and beere his lepys\r\nand his plungys wyth the helpe of your croppe & of your honde.” The\r\nplace, the time of day, and the weather in which to fish, are next\r\nparticularly described after the exactitude peculiar to fishing\r\nmanuals of the olden time. These paragraphs are well worth the\r\nconsideration of a modern angler, especially the charge, “yf the\r\nwynde be in the Eest, that is worste For comynly neyther wynter nor\r\nsomer y^e fysshe woll not byte thenne.”\r\n\r\nThe following part of the treatise, with what baits and how to angle\r\nfor each kind of fish, together with a brief description of each,\r\ncertainly furnished Walton with a model for some of his chapters.\r\nThis portion of her book is regarded by the authoress as most\r\nnecessary to be known and proficiency in carrying out her rules “is\r\nall the effecte of the crafte.” She adds amusingly, “for ye can\r\nnot brynge an hoke in to a fyssh mouth wythout a bayte.” A few of\r\nthe quaint receipts of her age succeed; how to keep live baits, to\r\nmake pastes and the like, ending with a rule which is often given\r\nto flyfishers for trout at the present day: “Whan ye haue take a\r\ngrete fysshe : vndo the mawe, & what ye fynde therin make that your\r\nbayte : for it is beste.”\r\n\r\nJust as the authoress rises to eloquence at the beginning of the\r\ntreatise when comparing the fisher’s happy life with the toils and\r\ntroubles which too often fall to the lot of the hunter, hawker, and\r\nfowler, so the end of these rules once more recalls her enthusiasm.\r\nThe last two pages of the book give us a portrait of her conception\r\nof the perfect angler, and it is no presumption to say that a nobler\r\nand truer picture has never been limned. Simplicity of disposition,\r\nforbearance to our neighbours’ rights, and consideration for the\r\npoor, are strongly inculcated. All covetousness in fishing or\r\nemployment of its gentle art to increase worldly gain and fill the\r\nlarder is equally condemned. She holds the highest view of angling;\r\nthat it is to serve a man for solace, and to cause the health of his\r\nbody, but especially of his soul. So she would have him pursue his\r\ncraft alone for the most part, when his mind can rise to high and\r\nholy things, and he may serve God devoutly by saying from his heart\r\nhis customary prayer. Nor should a man ever carry his amusement to\r\nexcess, and catch too much at one time; this is to destroy his\r\nfuture pleasure and to interfere with that of his neighbours. A good\r\nsportsman too, she adds, will busy himself in nourishing the game\r\nand destroying all vermin. So will what Walton calls “the civil,\r\nwell-governed angler” escape the vices which spring from idleness,\r\nand enjoy the full delights of an elevating and noble recreation.\r\n“And all those that done after this rule shall haue the blessynge of\r\ngod & saynt Petyr, whyche he theym graunte that wyth his precyous\r\nblood vs boughte.”\r\n\r\n“And therefore to al you that ben vertuous : gentyll : and free borne\r\nI wryte & make this symple treatyse folowynge : by whyche ye may haue\r\nthe full crafte of anglynge to dysport you at your luste : to the\r\nentent that your aege maye the more floure and the more lenger to\r\nendure.”\r\n\r\nM.

Thus truly me semyth that this is not the\r\nbeste dysporte and game of the sayd foure. The dyspor | te and game\r\nof hawkynge is laboryous & noyouse also as me semyth. For often the\r\nfawkener leseth his hawkes as the {3} hunter his hoūdes. Thenne\r\nis his game & his dysporte goon. Full often cryeth he & whystelyth\r\ntyll that he be ryght euyll a thur | ste.

Many other suche I cowde\r\ntell : but drede of magre makith me for to leue.

A nother is at y^e grounde at an arche / or at a\r\nstange where it ebbyth and flowyth : for bleke : roche. and darse.\r\nThe thyrde is wyth a flote for all manere of fysshe.

The syxte is wyth a dubbyd hoke for the troughte & graylyng\r\n¶ And for the fyrste and pryncypall poynt in anglynge : kepe y^e\r\neuer fro the water fro the sighte of the fysshe : other ferre on the\r\nlonde : or ellys behynde a busshe that the fysshe se you not. For yf\r\nthey doo they wol not byte. ¶ Also loke that ye shadow not the water\r\nas moche as ye may. For it is that thynge that woll soone fraye the\r\nfysshe. And yf a fysshe be afrayed he woll not bi | te longe after.\r\nFor alle manere fysshe that fede by the grounde ye shall angle for\r\ntheim to the botom. soo that your hokys shall renne or lye on the\r\ngrounde. And for alle other fysshe that fede {12} aboue ye shall\r\nangle to theym in the myddes of the water or somdeale byneth or\r\nsomdeale aboue. For euer the gretter fisshe the nerer he lyeth the\r\nbotom of the water. And euer the smaller fysshe the more he smymmyth\r\naboue. ¶ The thyrde good poynt is whan the fysshe bytyth that ye be\r\nnot to hasty to smyte nor to late / For ye must abide tyll ye suppose\r\nthat the bayte be ferre in the mouth of the fysshe / and thenne abyde\r\nnoo longer. And this is for the groūde. ¶ And for the flote whan ye\r\nse it pul | lyd softly vnder the water : or elles caryed vpon the\r\nwater softly : thenne smyte. And loke that ye neuer ouersmyte the\r\nstrengthe of your lyne for brekynge. ¶ And yf it fortune you to smyte\r\na grete fysshe wyth a smalle harnays : thenne ye must lede hym in the\r\nwater and labour him there tyll he be drownyd and ouercome. Thenne\r\ntake hym as well as ye can or maye. and euer bewaar that ye holde not\r\nouer the strengthe of your lyne.

Ye shall angle in a pole or in a stondinge water in euery\r\nplace where it is ony thynge depe. The | re is not grete choyse of\r\nony places where it is ony thynge de | pe in a pole. For it is but\r\na pryson to fysshe. and they lyue for y^e more parte in hungre lyke\r\nprisoners : and therfore it is the lesse maystry to take theym.\r\nBut in a ryuer ye shall angle in euery place where it is depe and\r\nclere by the grounde : as grauell or claye wythout mudde or wedys.\r\nAnd in especyall yf that there be a manere whyrlynge of water or a\r\ncouert.

The seconde is yf your baytes be not good nor fyne. The\r\nthyrde is yf that ye angle not in bytynge tyme. The fourth is yf that\r\nthe fysshe be frayed w^t the syghte of a man.

Long s (“ſ”, Unicode character u+017f)\r\nhave been replaced by “s”. Words that were broken at the end of a\r\nline using a word continuation mark, either hyphen or double oblique\r\nhyphen (u+2e17), have been rejoined. Supposed words that were broken\r\nat the end of a line, but without a word continuation mark, have been\r\nrejoined by inserting a vertical line (u+7c) with thin spaces between\r\nthe two parts of the supposed word. For example, the word “whiche”\r\nwas often broken after the _i_, and would then be transcribed as\r\n“whi | che”. I produced the cover image and hereby assign it to\r\nthe public domain. In the text edition, italic text is marked with\r\nlow lines (“_”, u+5f); small capitals text is made uppercase;\r\nsuperscripted text is marked with “^” (u+5e). Original page images\r\nare available from archive.org—search for “treatyseoffysshy00bern”.\r\n\r\nThe blackletter pages of the original book had no printed page\r\nnumbers. Page numbers have been inserted into these ebook editions.\r\nIf a page number would properly lie within a broken word or a\r\nsupposed broken word, then the whole word was moved just below the\r\npage number.\r\n\r\nThere were throughout the blackletter part of the printed book\r\ninstances of a symbol that resembled a y with a smudge over it. These\r\nare likely variously e over y or t over y, i.e. abbreviations for\r\n_the_ and _that_. These symbols have been transcribed according to\r\ncontext as y^e or y^t. On page 16 there was what looks like a “d”\r\nwith a smudge over it, which has been transcribed as “d^r”. Other\r\nabbreviations that include a smudged small letter include “wy^t”,\r\n“w^t”, “togyd^r”, etc. In all these instances, the superscripted mark\r\nis a guess based on context.\r\n\r\nParagraphs or sections in the blackletter part were variously marked.\r\nSections were indicated by either _capitulum_ or else drop cap.\r\nSparsely supported capitulum (u+2e3f) is replaced by pilcrow (u+b6)\r\nin all editions. The text was justified, and sometimes a capitulum\r\nwould be preceded by white space on the right end of a line of\r\ntext and a line-break, sometimes by only a single space. Sometimes\r\nvertical white space preceded a capitulum or drop cap; sometimes not.\r\nThere are three instances (see pages 3 and 9) of white space on the\r\nright end of a line of text followed by a new sentence on a new line,\r\nbut without either capitulum or drop cap. In these ebook editions,\r\neither printed vertical space or a drop cap is transcribed as the\r\nbeginning of a new paragraph, i.e. as a new _< p >_ element in the\r\nhtml edition. Drop caps are indicated in the text edition by “++”\r\npreceding the letter.\r\n\r\nThe colon (u+3a) is used liberally throughout the blackletter part of\r\nthe book. It was usually printed with no space on either side; less\r\noften with a space only on the right side; and rarely with a space\r\nonly on the left side. Examples of the latter occur at page 4 line 4\r\nand at page 8 line 2. In this transcription, the colon spacing has\r\nbeen standardized in the blackletter part of the book to narrow space\r\non both sides.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the glyph we would call _period_ or _full stop_ (u+2e) was\r\nvariously printed with no space on either side, or space on one or\r\nboth sides. These have been standardized to modern usage: space on\r\nright side only. This glyph seems to have been used variously in the\r\nways we would use full stop or comma. In addition, roman numerals\r\nare transcribed with the full stop as in, for instance, “wyth .xij.\r\nheeres” (example is from page 10). In many places full stops seem to\r\nbe missing from the end of a sentence; these have not been corrected.\r\n\r\nIn the following sentence from page 1, “Salamon in his parablys sayth\r\nthat a good spyryte makyth a flourynge aege / that is a fayre aege &\r\na longe.”, the “ / ” is our transcription of a glyph shaped somewhat\r\nlike an abundantly distorted “3”, compressed horizontally. This glyph\r\nhas been interpreted herein as punctuation, similar to our modern\r\ncomma or virgule. The glyph was variously printed with no space on\r\neither side, or with space on both sides, or with space on the right\r\nside. In this ebook, the glyph has been transcribed as solidus (u+2f)\r\nwith thin space on both sides.\r\n\r\nThere is one exception. On page 20, line 1, the following sentence\r\nappears: “Ye shall fede and kepe them all in generall : but euery\r\nmanere by hymself wyth suche thyngꝭ in and on whiche they brede”.\r\nIn the html/epub/mobi editions, the mark after _thyng_ is shown\r\nas an image of the original mark. This mark strongly resembles the\r\nglyphs that have been elsewhere transcribed as solidus, but is bolder\r\nand more angular. The text edition transcribes this instance as “ꝭ”\r\n(u+a76d, Latin small letter IS)\r\n\r\n\r\nPage 2. The following sentence appears: “The seconde is labour not\r\noutrageoꝰ.” In the text edition, the mark following _outrageo_ has\r\nbeen transcribed as “ꝰ” (u+a770, modifier letter US). This character\r\noccurs only once in the text.\r\n\r\nPage 7. The phrase “For is is lyke y^e wedys” was changed to “For\r\nit is lyke y^e wedys”. In the phrase rendered herein as “that it\r\nwoll desyre ynough”, it has been suggested that the penultimate word\r\nshould perhaps be “befyxe” instead.\r\n\r\nPage 8. In “And gretter hokes ye shall mabe in the same wyse”, “mabe”\r\nshould perhaps be “make”?\r\n\r\nPage 10. In the illustration caption, “Pln̄be : Corke” should perhaps\r\nbe “Plūbe : Corke”.\r\n\r\nPage 12. In “the more he smymmyth aboue”, the word should perhaps be\r\n“swymmyth”.\r\n\r\nPage 13. In “in ony other placys where ye may se ony fyssh houe or\r\nha | ne ony fedynge”, “ha | ne” should perhaps be “ha | ue”?\r\n\r\nPage 17. In the phrase rendered herein “heeryd : & the hon | ie\r\ncombe.”, “hon | ie” was originally printed as “hou | ie”.\r\n\r\nPage 18. A smudge after the ampersand was ignored in the phrase “on\r\nthe osyer & the codworme”.\r\n\r\nPage 19. In “cast it in the water wyth a corde & a corke ”, the\r\nillegible mark ahead of “cord” has been transcribed “a ”. Also, the\r\nphrase “or ellis on y^e gron̄de” possibly should be “or ellis on y^e\r\ngroūde”.\r\n\r\nPage 20. In “But whan they ben in a slough”, the original print\r\nlooked like “ben|in”, with a thick black line between “ben” and “in”.\r\nIn the phrase “¶ A nother take the sewet”, there was a smudge after\r\n“nother” that might be taken for a comma, removed from this ebook\r\nedition. There were no other commas in the blackletter section of the\r\nbook.",
