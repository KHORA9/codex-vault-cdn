And upon His household and companions be abundant and abiding\r\nand eternal peace!\r\n\r\nFurther, we have harkened to what the nightingale of knowledge sang on the\r\nboughs of the tree of thy being, and learned what the dove of certitude\r\ncried on the branches of the bower of thy heart. Methinks I verily inhaled\r\nthe pure fragrances of the garment of thy love, and attained thy very\r\nmeeting from perusing thy letter. And since I noted thy mention of thy\r\ndeath in God, and thy life through Him, and thy love for the beloved of\r\nGod and the Manifestations of His Names and the Dawning-Points of His\r\nAttributes--I therefore reveal unto thee sacred and resplendent tokens from\r\nthe planes of glory, to attract thee into the court of holiness and\r\nnearness and beauty, and draw thee to a station wherein thou shalt see\r\nnothing in creation save the Face of thy Beloved One, the Honored, and\r\nbehold all created things only as in the day wherein none hath a mention.\r\n\r\nOf this hath the nightingale of oneness sung in the garden of\r\nGhawthiyyih.(4) He saith: \"And there shall appear upon the tablet of thine\r\nheart a writing of the subtle mysteries of 'Fear God and God will give you\r\nknowledge';(5) and the bird of thy soul shall recall the holy sanctuaries\r\nof preexistence and soar on the wings of longing in the heaven of 'walk\r\nthe beaten paths of thy Lord',(6) and gather the fruits of communion in\r\nthe gardens of 'Then feed on every kind of fruit.'\"(7)\r\n\r\nBy My life, O friend, wert thou to taste of these fruits, from the green\r\ngarden of these blossoms which grow in the lands of knowledge, beside the\r\norient lights of the Essence in the mirrors of names and\r\nattributes--yearning would seize the reins of patience and reserve from out\r\nthy hand, and make thy soul to shake with the flashing light, and draw\r\nthee from the earthly homeland to the first, heavenly abode in the Center\r\nof Realities, and lift thee to a plane wherein thou wouldst soar in the\r\nair even as thou walkest upon the earth, and move over the water as thou\r\nrunnest on the land. Wherefore, may it rejoice Me, and thee, and whosoever\r\nmounteth into the heaven of knowledge, and whose heart is refreshed by\r\nthis, that the wind of certitude hath blown over the garden of his being,\r\nfrom the Sheba of the All-Merciful.\r\n\r\nPeace be upon him who followeth the Right Path!\r\n\r\nAnd further: The stages that mark the wayfarer's journey from the abode of\r\ndust to the heavenly homeland are said to be seven. Some have called these\r\nSeven Valleys, and others, Seven Cities. And they say that until the\r\nwayfarer taketh leave of self, and traverseth these stages, he shall never\r\nreach to the ocean of nearness and union, nor drink of the peerless wine.\r\nThe first is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Valley of Search\r\n\r\n\r\nThe steed of this Valley is patience; without patience the wayfarer on\r\nthis journey will reach nowhere and attain no goal. Nor should he ever be\r\ndownhearted; if he strive for a hundred thousand years and yet fail to\r\nbehold the beauty of the Friend, he should not falter. For those who seek\r\nthe Ka'bih(8) of \"for Us\" rejoice in the tidings: \"In Our ways will We\r\nguide them.\"(9) In their search, they have stoutly girded up the loins of\r\nservice, and seek at every moment to journey from the plane of\r\nheedlessness into the realm of being. No bond shall hold them back, and no\r\ncounsel shall deter them.\r\n\r\nIt is incumbent on these servants that they cleanse the heart--which is the\r\nwellspring of divine treasures--from every marking, and that they turn away\r\nfrom imitation, which is following the traces of their forefathers and\r\nsires, and shut the door of friendliness and enmity upon all the people of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nIn this journey the seeker reacheth a stage wherein he seeth all created\r\nthings wandering distracted in search of the Friend. How many a Jacob will\r\nhe see, hunting after his Joseph; he will behold many a lover, hasting to\r\nseek the Beloved, he will witness a world of desiring ones searching after\r\nthe One Desired. At every moment he findeth a weighty matter, in every\r\nhour he becometh aware of a mystery; for he hath taken his heart away from\r\nboth worlds, and set out for the Ka'bih(10) of the Beloved. At every step,\r\naid from the Invisible Realm will attend him and the heat of his search\r\nwill grow.\r\n\r\nOne must judge of search by the standard of the Majnun of Love.(11) It is\r\nrelated that one day they came upon Majnun sifting the dust, and his tears\r\nflowing down. They said, \"What doest thou?\" He said, \"I seek for Layli.\"\r\nThey cried, \"Alas for thee! Layli is of pure spirit, and thou seekest her\r\nin the dust!\" He said, \"I seek her everywhere; haply somewhere I shall\r\nfind her.\"\r\n\r\nYea, although to the wise it be shameful to seek the Lord of Lords in the\r\ndust, yet this betokeneth intense ardor in searching. \"Whoso seeketh out a\r\nthing with zeal shall find it.\"(12)\r\n\r\nThe true seeker hunteth naught but the object of his quest, and the lover\r\nhath no desire save union with his beloved. Nor shall the seeker reach his\r\ngoal unless he sacrifice all things. That is, whatever he hath seen, and\r\nheard, and understood, all must he set at naught, that he may enter the\r\nrealm of the spirit, which is the City of God. Labor is needed, if we are\r\nto seek Him; ardor is needed, if we are to drink of the honey of reunion\r\nwith Him; and if we taste of this cup, we shall cast away the world.\r\n\r\nOn this journey the traveler abideth in every land and dwelleth in every\r\nregion. In every face, he seeketh the beauty of the Friend; in every\r\ncountry he looketh for the Beloved. He joineth every company, and seeketh\r\nfellowship with every soul, that haply in some mind he may uncover the\r\nsecret of the Friend, or in some face he may behold the beauty of the\r\nLoved One.\r\n\r\nAnd if, by the help of God, he findeth on this journey a trace of the\r\ntraceless Friend, and inhaleth the fragrance of the long-lost Joseph from\r\nthe heavenly messenger,(13) he shall straightway step into\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Valley of Love\r\n\r\n\r\nand be dissolved in the fire of love. In this city the heaven of ecstasy\r\nis upraised and the world-illuming sun of yearning shineth, and the fire\r\nof love is ablaze; and when the fire of love is ablaze, it burneth to\r\nashes the harvest of reason.\r\n\r\nNow is the traveler unaware of himself, and of aught besides himself. He\r\nseeth neither ignorance nor knowledge, neither doubt nor certitude; he\r\nknoweth not the morn of guidance from the night of error. He fleeth both\r\nfrom unbelief and faith, and deadly poison is a balm to him. Wherefore\r\nAttar(14) saith:\r\n\r\n  For the infidel, error--for the faithful, faith;\r\n  For Attar's heart, an atom of Thy pain.\r\n\r\nThe steed of this Valley is pain; and if there be no pain this journey\r\nwill never end. In this station the lover hath no thought save the\r\nBeloved, and seeketh no refuge save the Friend. At every moment he\r\noffereth a hundred lives in the path of the Loved One, at every step he\r\nthroweth a thousand heads at the feet of the Beloved.\r\n\r\nO My Brother! Until thou enter the Egypt of love, thou shalt never come to\r\nthe Joseph of the Beauty of the Friend; and until, like Jacob, thou\r\nforsake thine outward eyes, thou shalt never open the eye of thine inward\r\nbeing; and until thou burn with the fire of love, thou shalt never commune\r\nwith the Lover of Longing.\r\n\r\nA lover feareth nothing and no harm can come nigh him: Thou seest him\r\nchill in the fire and dry in the sea.\r\n\r\n  A lover is he who is chill in hell fire;\r\n  A knower is he who is dry in the sea.(15)\r\n\r\nLove accepteth no existence and wisheth no life: He seeth life in death,\r\nand in shame seeketh glory. To merit the madness of love, man must abound\r\nin sanity; to merit the bonds of the Friend, he must be full of spirit.\r\nBlessed the neck that is caught in His noose, happy the head that falleth\r\non the dust in the pathway of His love. Wherefore, O friend, give up thy\r\nself that thou mayest find the Peerless One, pass by this mortal earth\r\nthat thou mayest seek a home in the nest of heaven. Be as naught, if thou\r\nwouldst kindle the fire of being and be fit for the pathway of love.\r\n\r\n  Love seizeth not upon a living soul,\r\n  The falcon preyeth not on a dead mouse.(16)\r\n\r\nLove setteth a world aflame at every turn, and he wasteth every land where\r\nhe carrieth his banner. Being hath no existence in his kingdom; the wise\r\nwield no command within his realm. The leviathan of love swalloweth the\r\nmaster of reason and destroyeth the lord of knowledge. He drinketh the\r\nseven seas, but his heart's thirst is still unquenched, and he saith, \"Is\r\nthere yet any more?\"(17) He shunneth himself and draweth away from all on\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n  Love's a stranger to earth and heaven too;\r\n  In him are lunacies seventy-and-two.(18)\r\n\r\nHe hath bound a myriad victims in his fetters, wounded a myriad wise men\r\nwith his arrow. Know that every redness in the world is from his anger,\r\nand every paleness in men's cheeks is from his poison. He yieldeth no\r\nremedy but death, he walketh not save in the valley of the shadow; yet\r\nsweeter than honey is his venom on the lover's lips, and fairer his\r\ndestruction in the seeker's eyes than a hundred thousand lives.\r\n\r\nWherefore must the veils of the satanic self be burned away at the fire of\r\nlove, that the spirit may be purified and cleansed and thus may know the\r\nstation of the Lord of the Worlds.\r\n\r\n  Kindle the fire of love and burn away all things,\r\n  Then set thy foot into the land of the lovers.(19)\r\n\r\nAnd if, confirmed by the Creator, the lover escapes from the claws of the\r\neagle of love, he will enter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Valley of Knowledge\r\n\r\n\r\nand come out of doubt into certitude, and turn from the darkness of\r\nillusion to the guiding light of the fear of God. His inner eyes will open\r\nand he will privily converse with his Beloved; he will set ajar the gate\r\nof truth and piety, and shut the doors of vain imaginings. He in this\r\nstation is content with the decree of God, and seeth war as peace, and\r\nfindeth in death the secrets of everlasting life. With inward and outward\r\neyes he witnesseth the mysteries of resurrection in the realms of creation\r\nand the souls of men, and with a pure heart apprehendeth the divine wisdom\r\nin the endless Manifestations of God. In the ocean he findeth a drop, in a\r\ndrop he beholdeth the secrets of the sea.\r\n\r\n  Split the atom's heart, and lo!\r\n  Within it thou wilt find a sun.(20)\r\n\r\nThe wayfarer in this Valley seeth in the fashionings of the True One\r\nnothing save clear providence, and at every moment saith: \"No defect canst\r\nthou see in the creation of the God of Mercy: Repeat the gaze: Seest thou\r\na single flaw?\"(21) He beholdeth justice in injustice, and in justice,\r\ngrace. In ignorance he findeth many a knowledge hidden, and in knowledge a\r\nmyriad wisdoms manifest. He breaketh the cage of the body and the\r\npassions, and consorteth with the people of the immortal realm. He\r\nmounteth on the ladders of inner truth and hasteneth to the heaven of\r\ninner significance. He rideth in the ark of \"we shall show them our signs\r\nin the regions and in themselves,\"(22) and journeyeth over the sea of\r\n\"until it become plain to them that (this Book) is the truth.\"(23) And if\r\nhe meeteth with injustice he shall have patience, and if he cometh upon\r\nwrath he shall manifest love.\r\n\r\nThere was once a lover who had sighed for long years in separation from\r\nhis beloved, and wasted in the fire of remoteness. From the rule of love,\r\nhis heart was empty of patience, and his body weary of his spirit; he\r\nreckoned life without her as a mockery, and time consumed him away. How\r\nmany a day he found no rest in longing for her; how many a night the pain\r\nof her kept him from sleep; his body was worn to a sigh, his heart's wound\r\nhad turned him to a cry of sorrow. He had given a thousand lives for one\r\ntaste of the cup of her presence, but it availed him not. The doctors knew\r\nno cure for him, and companions avoided his company; yea, physicians have\r\nno medicine for one sick of love, unless the favor of the beloved one\r\ndeliver him.\r\n\r\nAt last, the tree of his longing yielded the fruit of despair, and the\r\nfire of his hope fell to ashes. Then one night he could live no more, and\r\nhe went out of his house and made for the marketplace. On a sudden, a\r\nwatchman followed after him. He broke into a run, with the watchman\r\nfollowing; then other watchmen came together, and barred every passage to\r\nthe weary one. And the wretched one cried from his heart, and ran here and\r\nthere, and moaned to himself: \"Surely this watchman is Izra'il, my angel\r\nof death, following so fast upon me; or he is a tyrant of men, seeking to\r\nharm me.\" His feet carried him on, the one bleeding with the arrow of\r\nlove, and his heart lamented. Then he came to a garden wall, and with\r\nuntold pain he scaled it, for it proved very high; and forgetting his\r\nlife, he threw himself down to the garden.\r\n\r\nAnd there he beheld his beloved with a lamp in her hand, searching for a\r\nring she had lost. When the heart-surrendered lover looked on his\r\nravishing love, he drew a great breath and raised up his hands in prayer,\r\ncrying: \"O God! Give Thou glory to the watchman, and riches and long life.\r\nFor the watchman was Gabriel, guiding this poor one; or he was Israfil,\r\nbringing life to this wretched one!\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, his words were true, for he had found many a secret justice in\r\nthis seeming tyranny of the watchman, and seen how many a mercy lay hid\r\nbehind the veil. Out of wrath, the guard had led him who was athirst in\r\nlove's desert to the sea of his loved one, and lit up the dark night of\r\nabsence with the light of reunion. He had driven one who was afar, into\r\nthe garden of nearness, had guided an ailing soul to the heart's\r\nphysician.\r\n\r\nNow if the lover could have looked ahead, he would have blessed the\r\nwatchman at the start, and prayed on his behalf, and he would have seen\r\nthat tyranny as justice; but since the end was veiled to him, he moaned\r\nand made his plaint in the beginning. Yet those who journey in the garden\r\nland of knowledge, because they see the end in the beginning, see peace in\r\nwar and friendliness in anger.\r\n\r\nSuch is the state of the wayfarers in this Valley; but the people of the\r\nValleys above this see the end and the beginning as one; nay, they see\r\nneither beginning nor end, and witness neither \"first\" nor \"last.\"(24) Nay\r\nrather, the denizens of the undying city, who dwell in the green garden\r\nland, see not even \"neither first nor last\"; they fly from all that is\r\nfirst, and repulse all that is last. For these have passed over the worlds\r\nof names, and fled beyond the worlds of attributes as swift as lightning.\r\nThus is it said: \"Absolute Unity excludeth all attributes.\"(25) And they\r\nhave made their dwelling-place in the shadow of the Essence.\r\n\r\nWherefore, relevant to this, Khajih 'Abdu'llah(26)--may God the Most High\r\nsanctify his beloved spirit--hath made a subtle point and spoken an\r\neloquent word as to the meaning of \"Guide Thou us on the straight\r\npath,\"(27) which is: \"Show us the right way, that is, honor us with the\r\nlove of Thine Essence, that we may be freed from turning toward ourselves\r\nand toward all else save Thee, and may become wholly Thine, and know only\r\nThee, and see only Thee, and think of none save Thee.\"\r\n\r\nNay, these even mount above this station, wherefore it is said:\r\n\r\n  Love is a veil betwixt the lover and the loved one;\r\n  More than this I am not permitted to tell.(28)\r\n\r\nAt this hour the morn of knowledge hath arisen and the lamps of wayfaring\r\nand wandering are quenched.(29)\r\n\r\n  Veiled from this was Moses\r\n  Though all strength and light;\r\n  Then thou who hast no wings at all,\r\n  Attempt not flight.(30)\r\n\r\nIf thou be a man of communion and prayer, soar up on the wings of\r\nassistance from Holy Souls, that thou mayest behold the mysteries of the\r\nFriend and attain to the lights of the Beloved, \"Verily, we are from God\r\nand to Him shall we return.\"(31)\r\n\r\nAfter passing through the Valley of knowledge, which is the last plane of\r\nlimitation, the wayfarer cometh to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Valley of Unity\r\n\r\n\r\nand drinketh from the cup of the Absolute, and gazeth on the\r\nManifestations of Oneness. In this station he pierceth the veils of\r\nplurality, fleeth from the worlds of the flesh, and ascendeth into the\r\nheaven of singleness. With the ear of God he heareth, with the eye of God\r\nhe beholdeth the mysteries of divine creation. He steppeth into the\r\nsanctuary of the Friend, and shareth as an intimate the pavilion of the\r\nLoved One. He stretcheth out the hand of truth from the sleeve of the\r\nAbsolute; he revealeth the secrets of power. He seeth in himself neither\r\nname nor fame nor rank, but findeth his own praise in praising God. He\r\nbeholdeth in his own name the name of God; to him, \"all songs are from the\r\nKing,\"(32) and every melody from Him. He sitteth on the throne of \"Say,\r\nall is from God,\"(33) and taketh his rest on the carpet of \"There is no\r\npower or might but in God.\"(34) He looketh on all things with the eye of\r\noneness, and seeth the brilliant rays of the divine sun shining from the\r\ndawning-point of Essence alike on all created things, and the lights of\r\nsingleness reflected over all creation.\r\n\r\nIt is clear to thine Eminence that all the variations which the wayfarer\r\nin the stages of his journey beholdeth in the realms of being, proceed\r\nfrom his own vision. We shall give an example of this, that its meaning\r\nmay become fully clear: Consider the visible sun; although it shineth with\r\none radiance upon all things, and at the behest of the King of\r\nManifestation bestoweth light on all creation, yet in each place it\r\nbecometh manifest and sheddeth its bounty according to the potentialities\r\nof that place. For instance, in a mirror it reflecteth its own disk and\r\nshape, and this is due to the sensitivity of the mirror; in a crystal it\r\nmaketh fire to appear, and in other things it showeth only the effect of\r\nits shining, but not its full disk. And yet, through that effect, by the\r\ncommand of the Creator, it traineth each thing according to the quality of\r\nthat thing, as thou observest.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, colors become visible in every object according to the\r\nnature of that object. For instance, in a yellow globe, the rays shine\r\nyellow; in a white the rays are white; and in a red, the red rays are\r\nmanifest. Then these variations are from the object, not from the shining\r\nlight. And if a place be shut away from the light, as by walls or a roof,\r\nit will be entirely bereft of the splendor of the light, nor will the sun\r\nshine thereon.\r\n\r\nThus it is that certain invalid souls have confined the lands of knowledge\r\nwithin the wall of self and passion, and clouded them with ignorance and\r\nblindness, and have been veiled from the light of the mystic sun and the\r\nmysteries of the Eternal Beloved; they have strayed afar from the jewelled\r\nwisdom of the lucid Faith of the Lord of Messengers, have been shut out of\r\nthe sanctuary of the All-Beauteous One, and banished from the Ka'bih(35)\r\nof splendor. Such is the worth of the people of this age!\r\n\r\nAnd if a nightingale(36) soar upward from the clay of self and dwell in\r\nthe rose bower of the heart, and in Arabian melodies and sweet Iranian\r\nsongs recount the mysteries of God--a single word of which quickeneth to\r\nfresh, new life the bodies of the dead, and bestoweth the Holy Spirit upon\r\nthe moldering bones of this existence--thou wilt behold a thousand claws of\r\nenvy, a myriad beaks of rancor hunting after Him and with all their power\r\nintent upon His death.\r\n\r\nYea, to the beetle a sweet fragrance seemeth foul, and to the man sick of\r\na rheum a pleasant perfume is as naught. Wherefore, it hath been said for\r\nthe guidance of the ignorant:\r\n\r\n  Cleanse thou the rheum from out thine head\r\n  And breathe the breath of God instead.(37)\r\n\r\nIn sum, the differences in objects have now been made plain. Thus when the\r\nwayfarer gazeth only upon the place of appearance--that is, when he seeth\r\nonly the many-colored globes--he beholdeth yellow and red and white; hence\r\nit is that conflict hath prevailed among the creatures, and a darksome\r\ndust from limited souls hath hid the world. And some do gaze upon the\r\neffulgence of the light; and some have drunk of the wine of oneness and\r\nthese see nothing but the sun itself.\r\n\r\nThus, for that they move on these three differing planes, the\r\nunderstanding and the words of the wayfarers have differed; and hence the\r\nsign of conflict doth continually appear on earth. For some there are who\r\ndwell upon the plane of oneness and speak of that world, and some inhabit\r\nthe realms of limitation, and some the grades of self, while others are\r\ncompletely veiled. Thus do the ignorant people of the day, who have no\r\nportion of the radiance of Divine Beauty, make certain claims, and in\r\nevery age and cycle inflict on the people of the sea of oneness what they\r\nthemselves deserve. \"Should God punish men for their perverse doings, He\r\nwould not leave on earth a moving thing! But to an appointed term doth He\r\nrespite them....\"(38)\r\n\r\nO My Brother! A pure heart is as a mirror; cleanse it with the burnish of\r\nlove and severance from all save God, that the true sun may shine within\r\nit and the eternal morning dawn. Then wilt thou clearly see the meaning of\r\n\"Neither doth My earth nor My heaven contain Me, but the heart of My\r\nfaithful servant containeth Me.\"(39) And thou wilt take up thy life in\r\nthine hand, and with infinite longing cast it before the new Beloved One.\r\n\r\nWhensoever the light of Manifestation of the King of Oneness settleth upon\r\nthe throne of the heart and soul, His shining becometh visible in every\r\nlimb and member. At that time the mystery of the famed tradition gleameth\r\nout of the darkness: \"A servant is drawn unto Me in prayer until I answer\r\nhim; and when I have answered him, I become the ear wherewith he\r\nheareth....\" For thus the Master of the house hath appeared within His\r\nhome, and all the pillars of the dwelling are ashine with His light. And\r\nthe action and effect of the light are from the Light-Giver; so it is that\r\nall move through Him and arise by His will. And this is that spring\r\nwhereof the near ones drink, as it is said: \"A fount whereof the near unto\r\nGod shall drink....\"(40)\r\n\r\nHowever, let none construe these utterances to be anthropomorphism, nor\r\nsee in them the descent of the worlds of God into the grades of the\r\ncreatures; nor should they lead thine Eminence to such assumptions. For\r\nGod is, in His Essence, holy above ascent and descent, entrance and exit;\r\nHe hath through all eternity been free of the attributes of human\r\ncreatures, and ever will remain so. No man hath ever known Him; no soul\r\nhath ever found the pathway to His Being. Every mystic knower hath\r\nwandered far astray in the valley of the knowledge of Him; every saint\r\nhath lost his way in seeking to comprehend His Essence. Sanctified is He\r\nabove the understanding of the wise; exalted is He above the knowledge of\r\nthe knowing! The way is barred and to seek it is impiety; His proof is His\r\nsigns; His being is His evidence.(41)\r\n\r\nWherefore, the lovers of the face of the Beloved have said: \"O Thou, the\r\nOne Whose Essence alone showeth the way to His Essence, and Who is\r\nsanctified above any likeness to His creatures.\"(42) How can utter\r\nnothingness gallop its steed in the field of preexistence, or a fleeting\r\nshadow reach to the everlasting sun? The Friend(43) hath said, \"But for\r\nThee, we had not known Thee,\" and the Beloved(44) hath said, \"nor attained\r\nThy presence.\"\r\n\r\nYea, these mentionings that have been made of the grades of knowledge\r\nrelate to the knowledge of the Manifestations of that Sun of Reality,\r\nwhich casteth Its light upon the Mirrors. And the splendor of that light\r\nis in the hearts, yet it is hidden under the veilings of sense and the\r\nconditions of this earth, even as a candle within a lantern of iron, and\r\nonly when the lantern is removed doth the light of the candle shine out.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, when thou strippest the wrappings of illusion from off\r\nthine heart, the lights of oneness will be made manifest.\r\n\r\nThen it is clear that even for the rays there is neither entrance nor\r\nexit--how much less for that Essence of Being and that longed-for Mystery.\r\nO My Brother, journey upon these planes in the spirit of search, not in\r\nblind imitation. A true wayfarer will not be kept back by the bludgeon of\r\nwords nor debarred by the warning of allusions.\r\n\r\n  How shall a curtain part the lover and the loved one?\r\n  Not Alexander's wall can separate them!(45)\r\n\r\nSecrets are many, but strangers are myriad. Volumes will not suffice to\r\nhold the mystery of the Beloved One, nor can it be exhausted in these\r\npages, although it be no more than a word, no more than a sign. \"Knowledge\r\nis a single point, but the ignorant have multiplied it.\"(46)\r\n\r\nOn this same basis, ponder likewise the differences among the worlds.\r\nAlthough the divine worlds be never ending, yet some refer to them as\r\nfour: The world of time (zaman), which is the one that hath both a\r\nbeginning and an end; the world of duration (dahr), which hath a\r\nbeginning, but whose end is not revealed; the world of perpetuity\r\n(sarmad), whose beginning is not to be seen but which is known to have an\r\nend; and the world of eternity (azal), neither a beginning nor an end of\r\nwhich is visible. Although there are many differing statements as to these\r\npoints, to recount them in detail would result in weariness. Thus, some\r\nhave said that the world of perpetuity hath neither beginning nor end, and\r\nhave named the world of eternity as the invisible, impregnable Empyrean.\r\nOthers have called these the worlds of the Heavenly Court (Lahut), of the\r\nEmpyrean Heaven (Jabarut), of the Kingdom of the Angels (Malakut), and of\r\nthe mortal world (Nasut).\r\n\r\nThe journeys in the pathway of love are reckoned as four: From the\r\ncreatures to the True One; from the True One to the creatures; from the\r\ncreatures to the creatures; from the True One to the True One.\r\n\r\nThere is many an utterance of the mystic seers and doctors of former times\r\nwhich I have not mentioned here, since I mislike the copious citation from\r\nsayings of the past; for quotation from the words of others proveth\r\nacquired learning, not the divine bestowal. Even so much as We have quoted\r\nhere is out of deference to the wont of men and after the manner of the\r\nfriends. Further, such matters are beyond the scope of this epistle. Our\r\nunwillingness to recount their sayings is not from pride, rather is it a\r\nmanifestation of wisdom and a demonstration of grace.\r\n\r\n  If Khidr did wreck the vessel on the sea,\r\n  Yet in this wrong there are a thousand rights.(47)\r\n\r\nOtherwise, this Servant regardeth Himself as utterly lost and as nothing,\r\neven beside one of the beloved of God, how much less in the presence of\r\nHis holy ones. Exalted be My Lord, the Supreme! Moreover, our aim is to\r\nrecount the stages of the wayfarer's journey, not to set forth the\r\nconflicting utterances of the mystics.\r\n\r\nAlthough a brief example hath been given concerning the beginning and\r\nending of the relative world, the world of attributes, yet a second\r\nillustration is now added, that the full meaning may be manifest. For\r\ninstance, let thine Eminence consider his own self; thou art first in\r\nrelation to thy son, last in relation to thy father. In thine outward\r\nappearance, thou tellest of the appearance of power in the realms of\r\ndivine creation; in thine inward being thou revealest the hidden mysteries\r\nwhich are the divine trust deposited within thee. And thus firstness and\r\nlastness, outwardness and inwardness are, in the sense referred to, true\r\nof thyself, that in these four states conferred upon thee thou shouldst\r\ncomprehend the four divine states, and that the nightingale of thine heart\r\non all the branches of the rosetree of existence, whether visible or\r\nconcealed, should cry out: \"He is the first and the last, the Seen and the\r\nHidden....\"(48)\r\n\r\nThese statements are made in the sphere of that which is relative, because\r\nof the limitations of men. Otherwise, those personages who in a single\r\nstep have passed over the world of the relative and the limited, and dwelt\r\non the fair plane of the Absolute, and pitched their tent in the worlds of\r\nauthority and command--have burned away these relativities with a single\r\nspark, and blotted out these words with a drop of dew. And they swim in\r\nthe sea of the spirit, and soar in the holy air of light. Then what life\r\nhave words, on such a plane, that \"first\" and \"last\" or other than these\r\nbe seen or mentioned! In this realm, the first is the last itself, and the\r\nlast is but the first.\r\n\r\n  In thy soul of love build thou a fire\r\n  And burn all thoughts and words entire.(49)\r\n\r\nO my friend, look upon thyself: Hadst thou not become a father nor\r\nbegotten a son, neither wouldst thou have heard these sayings. Now forget\r\nthem all, that thou mayest learn from the Master of Love in the\r\nschoolhouse of oneness, and return unto God, and forsake the inner land of\r\nunreality(50) for thy true station, and dwell within the shadow of the\r\ntree of knowledge.\r\n\r\nO thou dear one! Impoverish thyself, that thou mayest enter the high court\r\nof riches; and humble thy body, that thou mayest drink from the river of\r\nglory, and attain to the full meaning of the poems whereof thou hadst\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nThus it hath been made clear that these stages depend on the vision of the\r\nwayfarer. In every city he will behold a world, in every Valley reach a\r\nspring, in every meadow hear a song. But the falcon of the mystic heaven\r\nhath many a wondrous carol of the spirit in His breast, and the Persian\r\nbird keepeth in His soul many a sweet Arab melody; yet these are hidden,\r\nand hidden shall remain.\r\n\r\n  If I speak forth, many a mind will shatter,\r\n  And if I write, many a pen will break.(51) ,(52)\r\n\r\nPeace be upon him who concludeth this exalted journey and followeth the\r\nTrue One by the lights of guidance.\r\n\r\nAnd the wayfarer, after traversing the high planes of this supernal\r\njourney, entereth\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Valley of Contentment\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this Valley he feeleth the winds of divine contentment blowing from the\r\nplane of the spirit. He burneth away the veils of want, and with inward\r\nand outward eye, perceiveth within and without all things the day of: \"God\r\nwill compensate each one out of His abundance.\"(53) From sorrow he turneth\r\nto bliss, from anguish to joy. His grief and mourning yield to delight and\r\nrapture.\r\n\r\nAlthough to outward view, the wayfarers in this Valley may dwell upon the\r\ndust, yet inwardly they are throned in the heights of mystic meaning; they\r\neat of the endless bounties of inner significances, and drink of the\r\ndelicate wines of the spirit.\r\n\r\nThe tongue faileth in describing these three Valleys, and speech falleth\r\nshort. The pen steppeth not into this region, the ink leaveth only a blot.\r\nIn these planes, the nightingale of the heart hath other songs and\r\nsecrets, which make the heart to stir and the soul to clamor, but this\r\nmystery of inner meaning may be whispered only from heart to heart,\r\nconfided only from breast to breast.\r\n\r\n  Only heart to heart can speak the bliss of mystic knowers;\r\n  No messenger can tell it and no missive bear it.(54)\r\n\r\n  I am silent from weakness on many a matter,\r\n  For my words could not reckon them and my speech would fall short.(55)\r\n\r\nO friend, till thou enter the garden of such mysteries, thou shalt never\r\nset lip to the undying wine of this Valley. And shouldst thou taste of it,\r\nthou wilt shield thine eyes from all things else, and drink of the wine of\r\ncontentment; and thou wilt loose thyself from all things else, and bind\r\nthyself to Him, and throw thy life down in His path, and cast thy soul\r\naway. However, there is no other in this region that thou need forget:\r\n\"There was God and there was naught beside Him.\"(56) For on this plane the\r\ntraveler witnesseth the beauty of the Friend in everything. Even in fire,\r\nhe seeth the face of the Beloved. He beholdeth in illusion the secret of\r\nreality, and readeth from the attributes the riddle of the Essence. For he\r\nhath burnt away the veils with his sighing, and unwrapped the shroudings\r\nwith a single glance; with piercing sight he gazeth on the new creation;\r\nwith lucid heart he graspeth subtle verities. This is sufficiently\r\nattested by: \"And we have made thy sight sharp in this day.\"(57)\r\n\r\nAfter journeying through the planes of pure contentment, the traveler\r\ncometh to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Valley of Wonderment\r\n\r\n\r\nand is tossed in the oceans of grandeur, and at every moment his wonder\r\ngroweth. Now he seeth the shape of wealth as poverty itself, and the\r\nessence of freedom as sheer impotence. Now is he struck dumb with the\r\nbeauty of the All-Glorious; again is he wearied out with his own life. How\r\nmany a mystic tree hath this whirlwind of wonderment snatched by the\r\nroots, how many a soul hath it exhausted. For in this Valley the traveler\r\nis flung into confusion, albeit, in the eye of him who hath attained, such\r\nmarvels are esteemed and well beloved. At every moment he beholdeth a\r\nwondrous world, a new creation, and goeth from astonishment to\r\nastonishment, and is lost in awe at the works of the Lord of Oneness.\r\n\r\nIndeed, O Brother, if we ponder each created thing, we shall witness a\r\nmyriad perfect wisdoms and learn a myriad new and wondrous truths. One of\r\nthe created phenomena is the dream. Behold how many secrets are deposited\r\ntherein, how many wisdoms treasured up, how many worlds concealed.\r\nObserve, how thou art asleep in a dwelling, and its doors are barred; on a\r\nsudden thou findest thyself in a far-off city, which thou enterest without\r\nmoving thy feet or wearying thy body; without using thine eyes, thou\r\nseest; without taxing thine ears, thou hearest; without a tongue, thou\r\nspeakest. And perchance when ten years are gone, thou wilt witness in the\r\nouter world the very things thou hast dreamed tonight.\r\n\r\nNow there are many wisdoms to ponder in the dream, which none but the\r\npeople of this Valley can comprehend in their true elements. First, what\r\nis this world, where without eye and ear and hand and tongue a man puts\r\nall of these to use? Second, how is it that in the outer world thou seest\r\ntoday the effect of a dream, when thou didst vision it in the world of\r\nsleep some ten years past? Consider the difference between these two\r\nworlds and the mysteries which they conceal, that thou mayest attain to\r\ndivine confirmations and heavenly discoveries and enter the regions of\r\nholiness.\r\n\r\nGod, the Exalted, hath placed these signs in men, to the end that\r\nphilosophers may not deny the mysteries of the life beyond nor belittle\r\nthat which hath been promised them. For some hold to reason and deny\r\nwhatever the reason comprehendeth not, and yet weak minds can never grasp\r\nthe matters which we have related, but only the Supreme, Divine\r\nIntelligence can comprehend them:\r\n\r\n  How can feeble reason encompass the Qur'an,\r\n  Or the spider snare a phoenix in his web?(58)\r\n\r\nAll these states are to be witnessed in the Valley of Wonderment, and the\r\ntraveler at every moment seeketh for more, and is not wearied. Thus the\r\nLord of the First and the Last in setting forth the grades of\r\ncontemplation, and expressing wonderment hath said: \"O Lord, increase my\r\nastonishment at Thee!\"\r\n\r\nLikewise, reflect upon the perfection of man's creation, and that all\r\nthese planes and states are folded up and hidden away within him.\r\n\r\n  Dost thou reckon thyself only a puny form\r\n  When within thee the universe is folded?(59)\r\n\r\nThen we must labor to destroy the animal condition, till the meaning of\r\nhumanity shall come to light.\r\n\r\nThus, too, Luqman, who had drunk from the wellspring of wisdom and tasted\r\nof the waters of mercy, in proving to his son Nathan the planes of\r\nresurrection and death, advanced the dream as an evidence and an example.\r\nWe relate it here, that through this evanescent Servant a memory may\r\nendure of that youth of the school of Divine Unity, that elder of the art\r\nof instruction and the Absolute. He said: \"O Son, if thou art able not to\r\nsleep, then thou art able not to die. And if thou art able not to waken\r\nafter sleep, then thou shalt be able not to rise after death.\"\r\n\r\nO friend, the heart is the dwelling of eternal mysteries, make it not the\r\nhome of fleeting fancies; waste not the treasure of thy precious life in\r\nemployment with this swiftly passing world. Thou comest from the world of\r\nholiness--bind not thine heart to the earth; thou art a dweller in the\r\ncourt of nearness--choose not the homeland of the dust.\r\n\r\nIn sum, there is no end to the description of these stages, but because of\r\nthe wrongs inflicted by the peoples of the earth, this Servant is in no\r\nmood to continue:\r\n\r\n  The tale is still unfinished and I have no heart for it--\r\n  Then pray forgive me.(60)\r\n\r\nThe pen groaneth and the ink sheddeth tears, and the river(61) of the\r\nheart moveth in waves of blood. \"Nothing can befall us but what God hath\r\ndestined for us.\"(62) Peace be upon him who followeth the Right Path!\r\n\r\nAfter scaling the high summits of wonderment the wayfarer cometh to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Valley of True Poverty and Absolute Nothingness\r\n\r\n\r\nThis station is the dying from self and the living in God, the being poor\r\nin self and rich in the Desired One. Poverty as here referred to\r\nsignifieth being poor in the things of the created world, rich in the\r\nthings of God's world. For when the true lover and devoted friend reacheth\r\nto the presence of the Beloved, the sparkling beauty of the Loved One and\r\nthe fire of the lover's heart will kindle a blaze and burn away all veils\r\nand wrappings. Yea, all he hath, from heart to skin, will be set aflame,\r\nso that nothing will remain save the Friend.\r\n\r\n  When the qualities of the Ancient of Days stood revealed,\r\n  Then the qualities of earthly things did Moses burn away.(63)\r\n\r\nHe who hath attained this station is sanctified from all that pertaineth\r\nto the world. Wherefore, if those who have come to the sea of His presence\r\nare found to possess none of the limited things of this perishable world,\r\nwhether it be outer wealth or personal opinions, it mattereth not. For\r\nwhatever the creatures have is limited by their own limits, and whatever\r\nthe True One hath is sanctified therefrom; this utterance must be deeply\r\npondered that its purport may be clear. \"Verily the righteous shall drink\r\nof a winecup tempered at the camphor fountain.\"(64) If the interpretation\r\nof \"camphor\" become known, the true intention will be evident. This state\r\nis that poverty of which it is said, \"Poverty is My glory.\"(65) And of\r\ninward and outward poverty there is many a stage and many a meaning which\r\nI have not thought pertinent to mention here; hence I have reserved these\r\nfor another time, dependent on what God may desire and fate may seal.\r\n\r\nThis is the plane whereon the vestiges of all things (Kullu Shay') are\r\ndestroyed in the traveler, and on the horizon of eternity the Divine Face\r\nriseth out of the darkness, and the meaning of \"All on the earth shall\r\npass away, but the face of thy Lord....\"(66) is made manifest.\r\n\r\nO My friend, listen with heart and soul to the songs of the spirit, and\r\ntreasure them as thine own eyes. For the heavenly wisdoms, like the clouds\r\nof spring, will not rain down on the earth of men's hearts forever; and\r\nthough the grace of the All-Bounteous One is never stilled and never\r\nceasing, yet to each time and era a portion is allotted and a bounty set\r\napart, this in a given measure. \"And no one thing is there, but with Us\r\nare its storehouses; and We send it not down but in settled measure.\"(67)\r\nThe cloud of the Loved One's mercy raineth only on the garden of the\r\nspirit, and bestoweth this bounty only in the season of spring. The other\r\nseasons have no share in this greatest grace, and barren lands no portion\r\nof this favor.\r\n\r\nO Brother! Not every sea hath pearls; not every branch will flower, nor\r\nwill the nightingale sing thereon. Then, ere the nightingale of the mystic\r\nparadise repair to the garden of God, and the rays of the heavenly morning\r\nreturn to the Sun of Truth--make thou an effort, that haply in this\r\ndustheap of the mortal world thou mayest catch a fragrance from the\r\neverlasting garden, and live forever in the shadow of the peoples of this\r\ncity. And when thou hast attained this highest station and come to this\r\nmightiest plane, then shalt thou gaze on the Beloved, and forget all else.\r\n\r\n  The Beloved shineth on gate and wall\r\n  Without a veil, O men of vision.(68)\r\n\r\nNow hast thou abandoned the drop of life and come to the sea of the\r\nLife-Bestower. This is the goal thou didst ask for; if it be God's will,\r\nthou wilt gain it.\r\n\r\nIn this city, even the veils of light are split asunder and vanish away.\r\n\"His beauty hath no veiling save light, His face no covering save\r\nrevelation.\"(69) How strange that while the Beloved is visible as the sun,\r\nyet the heedless still hunt after tinsel and base metal. Yea, the\r\nintensity of His revelation hath covered Him, and the fullness of His\r\nshining forth hath hidden Him.\r\n\r\n  Even as the sun, bright hath He shined,\r\n  But alas, He hath come to the town of the blind!(70)\r\n\r\nIn this Valley, the wayfarer leaveth behind him the stages of the \"oneness\r\nof Being and Manifestation\"(71) and reacheth a oneness that is sanctified\r\nabove these two stations. Ecstasy alone can encompass this theme, not\r\nutterance nor argument; and whosoever hath dwelt at this stage of the\r\njourney, or caught a breath from this garden land, knoweth whereof We\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\nIn all these journeys the traveler must stray not the breadth of a hair\r\nfrom the \"Law,\" for this is indeed the secret of the \"Path\" and the fruit\r\nof the Tree of \"Truth\"; and in all these stages he must cling to the robe\r\nof obedience to the commandments, and hold fast to the cord of shunning\r\nall forbidden things, that he may be nourished from the cup of the Law and\r\ninformed of the mysteries of Truth.(72)\r\n\r\nIf any of the utterances of this Servant may not be comprehended, or may\r\nlead to perturbation, the same must be inquired of again, that no doubt\r\nmay linger, and the meaning be clear as the Face of the Beloved One\r\nshining from the \"Glorious Station.\"(73)\r\n\r\nThese journeys have no visible ending in the world of time, but the\r\nsevered wayfarer--if invisible confirmation descend upon him and the\r\nGuardian of the Cause assist him--may cross these seven stages in seven\r\nsteps, nay rather in seven breaths, nay rather in a single breath, if God\r\nwill and desire it. And this is of \"His grace on such of His servants as\r\nHe pleaseth.\"(74)\r\n\r\nThey who soar in the heaven of singleness and reach to the sea of the\r\nAbsolute, reckon this city--which is the station of life in God--as the\r\nfurthermost state of mystic knowers, and the farthest homeland of the\r\nlovers. But to this evanescent One of the mystic ocean, this station is\r\nthe first gate of the heart's citadel, that is, man's first entrance to\r\nthe city of the heart; and the heart is endowed with four stages, which\r\nwould be recounted should a kindred soul be found.\r\n\r\n  When the pen set to picturing this station,\r\n  It broke in pieces and the page was torn.(75)\r\n\r\nSalam!(76)\r\n\r\nO My friend! Many a hound pursueth this gazelle of the desert of oneness;\r\nmany a talon claweth at this thrush of the eternal garden. Pitiless ravens\r\ndo lie in wait for this bird of the heavens of God, and the huntsman of\r\nenvy stalketh this deer of the meadow of love.\r\n\r\nO Shaykh! Make of thine effort a glass, perchance it may shelter this\r\nflame from the contrary winds; albeit this light doth long to be kindled\r\nin the lamp of the Lord, and to shine in the globe of the spirit. For the\r\nhead raised up in the love of God will certainly fall by the sword, and\r\nthe life that is kindled with longing will surely be sacrificed, and the\r\nheart which remembereth the Loved One will surely brim with blood. How\r\nwell is it said:\r\n\r\n  Live free of love, for its very peace is anguish;\r\n  Its beginning is pain, its end is death.(77)\r\n\r\nPeace be upon him who followeth the Right Path!\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe thoughts thou hast expressed as to the interpretation of the common\r\nspecies of bird that is called in Persian Gunjishk (sparrow) were\r\nconsidered.(78) Thou appearest to be well-grounded in mystic truth.\r\nHowever, on every plane, to every letter a meaning is allotted which\r\nrelateth to that plane. Indeed, the wayfarer findeth a secret in every\r\nname, a mystery in every letter. In one sense, these letters refer to\r\nholiness.\r\n\r\nKaf or Gaf (K or G) referreth to Kuffi (\"free\"), that is, \"Free thyself\r\nfrom that which thy passion desireth; then advance unto thy Lord.\"\r\n\r\nNun referreth to Nazzih (\"purify\"), that is, \"Purify thyself from all else\r\nsave Him, that thou mayest surrender thy life in His love.\"\r\n\r\nJim is Janib (\"draw back\"), that is, \"Draw back from the threshold of the\r\nTrue One if thou still possessest earthly attributes.\"\r\n\r\nShin is Ushkur (\"thank\")--\"Thank thy Lord on His earth that He may bless\r\nthee in His heaven; albeit in the world of oneness, this heaven is the\r\nsame as His earth.\"\r\n\r\nKaf referreth to Kuffi, that is: \"Take off from thyself the wrappings of\r\nlimitations, that thou mayest come to know what thou hast not known of the\r\nstates of Sanctity.\"(79)\r\n\r\nWert thou to harken to the melodies of this mortal Bird,(80) then wouldst\r\nthou seek out the undying chalice and pass by every perishable cup.\r\n\r\nPeace be upon those who walk in the Right Path!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOUR VALLEYS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Four Valleys\r\n\r\n\r\n_He is the Strong, the Well-Beloved!_\r\n\r\n  O light of truth, Hisam-i-Din, the bounteous,\r\n  No prince hath the world begot like unto Thee!(81)\r\n\r\nI am wondering why the tie of love was so abruptly severed, and the firm\r\ncovenant of friendship broken. Did ever, God forbid, My devotion lessen,\r\nor My deep affection fail, that thou hast thus forgot Me and blotted Me\r\nfrom thy thoughts?\r\n\r\n\r\n    What fault of Mine hath made thee cease thy favors?\r\n\r\n    Is it that We are lowly and thou of high degree?(82) Or is that a\r\n    single arrow hath driven thee from the battle?(83) Have they not\r\n    told thee that faithfulness is a duty on those who follow the\r\n    mystic way, that it is the true guide to His Holy Presence? \"But\r\n    as for those who say, 'Our Lord is God,' and who go straight to\r\n    Him, the angels shall descend to them....\"(84)\r\n\r\n\r\nLikewise He saith, \"Go straight on then as thou hast been commanded.\"(85)\r\nWherefore, this course is incumbent on those who dwell in the presence of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n  I do as bidden, and I bring the message,\r\n  Whether it give thee counsel or offense.(86)\r\n\r\nAlbeit I have received no answer to My letters and it is contrary to the\r\nusage of the wise to express My regard anew, yet this new love hath broken\r\nall the old rules and ways.\r\n\r\n  Tell us not the tale of Layli or of Majnun's woe--\r\n  Thy love hath made the world forget the loves of long ago.\r\n  When once thy name was on the tongue, the lovers caught it\r\n  And it set the speakers and the hearers dancing to and fro.(87)\r\n\r\nAnd of divine wisdom and heavenly counsel, [Rumi says]:\r\n\r\n  Each moon, O my beloved, for three days I go mad;\r\n  Today's the first of these--'Tis why thou seest me glad.\r\n\r\nWe hear that thou hast journeyed to Tabriz and Tiflis to disseminate\r\nknowledge, or that some other high purpose hath taken thee to\r\nSanandaj.(88), (89)\r\n\r\nO My eminent friend! Those who progress in mystic wayfaring are of four\r\nkinds. I shall describe them in brief, that the grades and qualities of\r\neach kind may become plain to thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe First Valley\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the travelers seek after the goal of the Intended One (maqsud), this\r\nstation appertaineth to the self--but that self which is \"The Self of God\r\nstanding within Him with laws.\"(90)\r\n\r\nOn this plane, the self is not rejected but beloved; it is well-pleasing\r\nand not to be shunned. Although at the beginning, this plane is the realm\r\nof conflict, yet it endeth in attainment to the throne of splendor. As\r\nthey have said: \"O Abraham of this day, O Friend Abraham of the Spirit!\r\nKill these four birds of prey,\"(91) that after death the riddle of life\r\nmay be unraveled.\r\n\r\nThis is the plane of the soul who is pleasing unto God. Refer to the\r\nverse:\r\n\r\n  O thou soul who art well assured,\r\n  Return to thy Lord, well-pleased, and pleasing unto Him.(92)\r\n\r\nwhich endeth:\r\n\r\n  Enter thou among My servants,\r\n  And enter thou My paradise.(93)\r\n\r\nThis station hath many signs, unnumbered proofs. Hence it is said:\r\n\"Hereafter We will show them Our signs in the regions of the earth, and in\r\nthemselves, until it become manifest unto them that it is the truth,\"(94)\r\nand that there is no God save Him.\r\n\r\nOne must, then, read the book of his own self, rather than some treatise\r\non rhetoric. Wherefore He hath said, \"Read thy Book: There needeth none\r\nbut thyself to make out an account against thee this day.\"(95)\r\n\r\nThe story is told of a mystic knower, who went on a journey with a learned\r\ngrammarian as his companion. They came to the shore of the Sea of\r\nGrandeur. The knower straightway flung himself into the waves, but the\r\ngrammarian stood lost in his reasonings, which were as words that are\r\nwritten on water. The knower called out to him, \"Why dost thou not\r\nfollow?\" The grammarian answered, \"O Brother, I dare not advance. I must\r\nneeds go back again.\" Then the knower cried, \"Forget what thou didst read\r\nin the books of Sibavayh and Qawlavayh, of Ibn-i-Hajib and\r\nIbn-i-Malik,(96) and cross the water.\"\r\n\r\n  The death of self is needed here, not rhetoric:\r\n  Be nothing, then, and walk upon the waves.(97)\r\n\r\nLikewise is it written, \"And be ye not like those who forget God, and whom\r\nHe hath therefore caused to forget their own selves. These are the wicked\r\ndoers.\"(98)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Second Valley\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the wayfarer's goal be the dwelling of the Praiseworthy One\r\n(Mahmud),(99) this is the station of primal reason which is known as the\r\nProphet and the Most Great Pillar.(100) Here reason signifieth the divine,\r\nuniversal mind, whose sovereignty enlighteneth all created things--nor doth\r\nit refer to every feeble brain; for it is as the wise Sana'i hath written:\r\n\r\n  How can feeble reason encompass the Qur'an,\r\n  Or the spider snare a phoenix in his web?\r\n  Wouldst thou that the mind should not entrap thee?\r\n  Teach it the science of the love of God!\r\n\r\nOn this plane, the traveler meeteth with many a trial and reverse. Now is\r\nhe lifted up to heaven, now is he cast into the depths. As it hath been\r\nsaid: \"Now Thou drawest me to the summit of glory, again Thou castest me\r\ninto the lowest abyss.\" The mystery treasured in this plane is divulged in\r\nthe following holy verse from the Surih of THE CAVE:(101)\r\n\r\n\"And thou mightest have seen the sun when it arose, pass on the right of\r\ntheir cave, and when it set, leave them on the left, while they were in\r\nits spacious chamber. This is one of the signs of God. Guided indeed is he\r\nwhom God guideth; but for him whom He misleadeth, thou shalt by no means\r\nfind a patron.\"\r\n\r\nIf a man could know what lieth hid in this one verse, it would suffice\r\nhim. Wherefore, in praise of such as these, He hath said: \"Men whom\r\nneither merchandise nor traffic beguile from the remembrance of\r\nGod....\"(102)\r\n\r\nThis station conferreth the true standard of knowledge, and freeth man\r\nfrom tests. In this realm, to search after knowledge is irrelevant, for He\r\nhath said concerning the guidance of travelers on this plane, \"Fear God,\r\nand God will instruct thee.\"(103) And again: \"Knowledge is a light which\r\nGod casteth into the heart of whomsoever He willeth.\"(104)\r\n\r\nWherefore, a man should make ready his heart that it be worthy of the\r\ndescent of heavenly grace, and that the bounteous Cup-Bearer may give him\r\nto drink of the wine of bestowal from the merciful vessel. \"For the like\r\nof this let the travailers travail!\"(105)\r\n\r\nAnd now do I say, \"Verily we are from God, and to Him shall we\r\nreturn.\"(106)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Third Valley\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the loving seekers wish to live within the precincts of the Attracting\r\nOne (Majdhub),(107) no soul may dwell on this Kingly Throne save the\r\nbeauty of love. This realm is not to be pictured in words.\r\n\r\n  Love shunneth this world and that world too,\r\n  In him are lunacies seventy-and-two.\r\n  The minstrel of love harpeth this lay:\r\n  Servitude enslaveth, kingship doth betray.(108)\r\n\r\nThis plane requireth pure affection and the bright stream of fellowship.\r\nIn telling of these companions of the Cave He saith: \"They speak not till\r\nHe hath spoken; and they do His bidding.\"(109)\r\n\r\nOn this plane, neither the reign of reason is sufficient nor the authority\r\nof self. Hence, one of the Prophets of God hath asked: \"O my Lord, how\r\nshall we reach unto Thee?\" And the answer came, \"Leave thyself behind, and\r\nthen approach Me.\"\r\n\r\nThese are a people who deem the lowest place to be one with the throne of\r\nglory, and to them beauty's bower differeth not from the field of a battle\r\nfought in the cause of the Beloved.\r\n\r\nThe denizens of this plane speak no words--but they gallop their chargers.\r\nThey see but the inner reality of the Beloved. To them all words of sense\r\nare meaningless, and senseless words are full of meaning. They cannot tell\r\none limb from another, one part from another. To them the mirage is the\r\nreal river; to them going away is returning. Wherefore hath it been said:\r\n\r\n  The story of Thy beauty reached the hermit's dell;\r\n  Crazed, he sought the Tavern where the wine they buy and sell.\r\n  The love of Thee hath leveled down the fort of patience,\r\n  The pain of Thee hath firmly barred the gate of hope as well.(110)\r\n\r\nIn this realm, instruction is assuredly of no avail.\r\n\r\n  The lover's teacher is the Loved One's beauty,\r\n  His face their lesson and their only book.\r\n  Learning of wonderment, of longing love their duty,\r\n  Not on learned chapters and dull themes they look.\r\n  The chain that binds them is His musky hair,\r\n  The Cyclic Scheme,(111) to them, is but to Him a stair.(112)\r\n\r\nHere followeth a supplication to God, the Exalted, the Glorified:\r\n\r\n  O Lord! O Thou Whose bounty granteth wishes!\r\n  I stand before Thee, all save Thee forgetting.\r\n  Grant that the mote of knowledge in my spirit\r\n  Escape desire and the lowly clay;\r\n  Grant that Thine ancient gift, this drop of wisdom,\r\n  Merge with Thy mighty sea.(113)\r\n\r\nThus do I say: There is no power or might save in God, the Protector, the\r\nSelf-Subsistent.(114)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Valley\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the mystic knowers be of those who have reached to the beauty of the\r\nBeloved One (Mahbub), this station is the apex of consciousness and the\r\nsecret of divine guidance. This is the center of the mystery: \"He doth\r\nwhat He willeth, ordaineth what He pleaseth.\"(115)\r\n\r\nWere all the denizens of earth and heaven to unravel this shining\r\nallusion, this darksome riddle, until the Day when the Trumpet soundeth,\r\nyet would they fail to comprehend even a letter thereof, for this is the\r\nstation of God's immutable decree, His foreordained mystery. Hence, when\r\nsearchers inquired of this, He made reply, \"This is a bottomless sea which\r\nnone shall ever fathom.\"(116) And they asked again, and He answered, \"It\r\nis the blackest of nights through which none can find his way.\"\r\n\r\nWhoso knoweth this secret will assuredly hide it, and were he to reveal\r\nbut its faintest trace they would nail him to the cross. Yet, by the\r\nLiving God, were there any true seeker, I would divulge it to him; for\r\nthey have said: \"Love is a light that never dwelleth in a heart possessed\r\nby fear.\"\r\n\r\nVerily, the wayfarer who journeyeth unto God, unto the Crimson Pillar in\r\nthe snow-white path, will never reach unto his heavenly goal unless he\r\nabandoneth all that men possess: \"And if he feareth not God, God will make\r\nhim to fear all things; whereas all things fear him who feareth God.\"(117)\r\n\r\n  Speak in the Persian tongue, though the Arab please thee more;\r\n  A lover hath many a tongue at his command.(118)\r\n\r\nHow sweet is this couplet which revealeth such a truth:\r\n\r\n  See, our hearts come open like shells, when He raineth grace like\r\n              pearls,\r\n  And our lives are ready targets, when agony's arrows He hurls.\r\n\r\nAnd were it not contrary to the Law of the Book, I would verily bequeath a\r\npart of My possessions to the one who would put Me to death, and I would\r\nname him My heir; yea, I would bestow upon him a portion, would render him\r\nthanks, would seek to refresh Mine eyes with the touch of his hand. But\r\nwhat can I do? I have no possessions, no power, and this is what God hath\r\nordained.(119)\r\n\r\nMethinks at this moment, I catch the fragrance of His garment(120) blowing\r\nfrom the Egypt of Baha;(121) verily He seemeth near at hand, though men\r\nmay think Him far away.(122) My soul doth smell the perfume shed by the\r\nBeloved One; My sense is filled with the fragrance of My dear Companion.\r\n\r\n  The duty of long years of love obey\r\n  And tell the tale of happy days gone by,\r\n  That land and sky may laugh aloud today,\r\n  And it may gladden mind and heart and eye.(123)\r\n\r\nThis is the realm of full awareness, of utter self-effacement. Even love\r\nis no pathway to this region, and longing hath no dwelling here; wherefore\r\nis it said, \"Love is a veil betwixt the lover and the beloved.\" Here love\r\nbecometh an obstruction and a barrier, and all else save Him is but a\r\ncurtain. The wise Sana'i hath written:\r\n\r\n  Never the covetous heart shall come to the stealer of hearts,\r\n  Never the shrouded soul unite with beauty's rose.\r\n\r\nFor this is the realm of Absolute Command and is free of all the\r\nattributes of earth.\r\n\r\nThe exalted dwellers in this mansion do wield divine authority in the\r\ncourt of rapture, with utter gladness, and they do bear a kingly sceptre.\r\nOn the high seats of justice, they issue their commands, and they send\r\ndown gifts according to each man's deserving. Those who drink of this cup\r\nabide in the high bowers of splendor above the Throne of the Ancient of\r\nDays, and they sit in the Empyrean of Might within the Lofty Pavilion:\r\n\"Naught shall they know of sun or piercing cold.\"(124)\r\n\r\nHerein the high heavens are in no conflict with the lowly earth, nor do\r\nthey seek to excel it, for this is the land of mercy, not the realm of\r\ndistinction. Albeit at every moment these souls appear in a new office,\r\nyet their condition is ever the same. Wherefore of this realm it is\r\nwritten, \"No work withholdeth Him from another.\"(125) And of another state\r\nit is said: \"Every day doth some new work employ Him.\"(126) This is the\r\nfood whose savor changeth not, whose color altereth not. If thou eatest\r\nthereof, thou shalt verily chant this verse: \"I turn my face to Him Who\r\nhath created the Heavens and the earth ... I am not one of those who add\r\ngods to God.\"(127) \"And thus did we show Abraham the Kingdom of the\r\nHeavens and of the Earth, that He might be established in knowledge.\"(128)\r\nWherefore, put thy hand into thy bosom, then stretch it forth with power,\r\nand behold, thou shalt find it a light unto all the world.\"(129)\r\n\r\nHow crystal this cool water that the Cup-Bearer bringeth! How bright this\r\npure wine in the hands of the Beloved! How delicate this draught from the\r\nHeavenly Cup! May it do them good, whoso drink thereof, and taste of its\r\nsweetness and attain to its knowledge.\r\n\r\n  It is not fitting that I tell thee more,\r\n  For the stream's bed cannot hold the sea.(130)\r\n\r\nFor the mystery of this utterance is hid within the storehouse of the\r\nGreat Infallibility(131) and laid up in the treasuries of power. It is\r\nsanctified above the jewels of explanation; it is beyond what the most\r\nsubtle of tongues can tell.\r\n\r\nAstonishment here is highly prized, and utter poverty essential. Wherefore\r\nhath it been said, \"Poverty is My pride.\"(132) And again: \"God hath a\r\npeople beneath the dome of glory, whom He hideth in the clothing of\r\nradiant poverty.\"(133) These are they who see with His eyes, hear with His\r\nears, as it is written in the well-known tradition.\r\n\r\nConcerning this realm, there is many a tradition and many a verse, of\r\nbroad or special relevancy, but two of these will suffice to serve as a\r\nlight for men of mind and heart.\r\n\r\nThe first is His statement: \"O My Servant! Obey Me and I shall make thee\r\nlike unto Myself. I say 'Be,' and it is, and thou shalt say 'Be,' and it\r\nshall be.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the second: \"O Son of Adam! Seek fellowship with none until thou hast\r\nfound Me, and whenever thou shalt long for Me, thou shalt find Me close to\r\nthee.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever high proofs and wondrous allusions are recounted herein, concern\r\nbut a single Letter, a single Point. \"Such hath been the way of God ...\r\nand no change canst thou find in the way of God.\"(134)\r\n\r\nI began this epistle some time ago, in thy remembrance, and since thy\r\nletter had not reached me then, I began with some words of reproach. Now,\r\nthy new missive hath dispelled that feeling and causeth Me to write thee.\r\nTo speak of My love for thine Eminence is needless. \"God is a sufficient\r\nwitness!\"(135) For his Eminence Shaykh Muhammad--May God the Exalted bless\r\nhim!--I shall confine Myself to the two following verses which I request be\r\ndelivered to him:\r\n\r\n  I seek thy nearness, dearer than sweet Heaven;\r\n  I see thy visage, fairer than Paradise bowers.(136)\r\n\r\nWhen I entrusted this message of love to My pen, it refused the burden,\r\nand it swooned away. Then coming to itself, it spoke and said, \"Glory be\r\nto Thee! To Thee do I turn in penitence, and I am the first of them that\r\nbelieve.\"(137) Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds!\r\n\r\n  Let us tell, some other day\r\n  This parting hurt and woe;\r\n  Let us write, some other way,\r\n  Love's secrets--better so.\r\n  Leave blood and noise and all of these,\r\n  And say no more of Shams-i-Tabriz.(138)\r\n\r\nPeace be upon thee, and upon those who circle around thee and attain thy\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\nWhat I had written ere this hath been eaten by the flies, so sweet was the\r\nink. As Sa'di saith: \"I shall forbear from writing any longer, for my\r\nsweet words have drawn the flies about me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now the hand can write no more, and pleadeth that this is enough.\r\nWherefore do I say, \"Far be the glory of thy Lord, the Lord of all\r\ngreatness, from what they affirm of Him.\"(139)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n    1 The Manifestation.\r\n\r\n    2 Muhammad, Ahmad and Mahmud are names and titles of the Prophet,\r\n      derived from the verb \"to praise,\" \"to exalt.\"\r\n\r\n    3 Qur'an 17:110.\r\n\r\n    4 Sermon by 'Ali.\r\n\r\n    5 Qur'an 2:282.\r\n\r\n    6 Qur'an 16:71.\r\n\r\n    7 Qur'an 16:71.\r\n\r\n    8 The holy Sanctuary at Mecca.

Symbolizing true human\r\n      love bordering on the divine, the story has been made the theme of\r\n      many a Persian romantic poem, particularly that of Nizami, written\r\n      in 1188-1189 A.D.\r\n\r\n   12 Arabian proverb.\r\n\r\n   13 Refer to the story of Joesph in the Qur'an and the Old Testament.\r\n\r\n   14 Faridu'd-Din Attar (ca. 1150-1230 A.D.), the great Persian Sufi\r\n      poet.\r\n\r\n   15 Persian mystic poem.\r\n\r\n   16 Persian mystic poem.

Shari'at, or\r\n      Religious Laws; 2. Tariqat, or the Path on which the mystic wayfarer\r\n      journeys in search of the True One; this stage also includes\r\n      anchoretism. 3. Haqiqat, or the Truth which, to the Sufi, is the\r\n      goal of the journey through all three stages. Here Baha'u'llah\r\n      teaches that, contrary to the belief of certain Sufis who in their\r\n      search for the Truth consider themselves above all law, obedience to\r\n      the Laws of Religion is essential.\r\n\r\n   73 Maqam-i-Mahmud.
