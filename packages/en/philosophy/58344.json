Shadow flowed into his dark eyes in the mango groves, when\r\nplaying boyish games, when his mother sang, when he talked with the wise\r\nones. Siddhartha spent many hours in conversation with the wise ones, he\r\npractised his skills of rhetoric with Govinda, practised the art of\r\nthought with Govinda, in order to achieve mystic contemplation. He was\r\nalready able to utter the holy word, Om, in silence, the word of words, in\r\nsilence to utter it and draw it in with his breath, in silence to utter it\r\nand send it out with his breath, his mind collected, his brow surrounded\r\nwith the light of the clear-thinking soul. He was already able to\r\nunderstand, in his innermost being, the nature of Atman, indestructible,\r\nat one with the universe.\r\n\r\nJoy sprang up in his father’s heart when he saw his son, the learned\r\none, the one with a thirst for knowledge, joy sprang up when he foretold\r\nthat he would grow into a wise man and a priest, a prince among the\r\nbrahmins.\r\n\r\nBliss sprang up in his mother’s breast when she saw her son, when she\r\nsaw him walk, when she saw him sit down and stand up, Siddhartha, the\r\nstrong one, the handsome one, walking on his slender legs, when, with\r\nperfect decorum, he her offered her his greetings.\r\n\r\nLove was stirred in the hearts of the brahmins’ daughters when they saw\r\nSiddhartha walk through the streets of the town, his luminous brow, the\r\neyes of a king, his narrow hips.\r\n\r\nBut the one who loved him more than all the others was Govinda, his\r\nfriend, the brahmin’s son. He loved Siddhartha’s eyes and his noble\r\nvoice, he loved his walk and the perfect grace of his movements, he loved\r\neverything that Siddhartha did or said, and most of all he loved his soul,\r\nhis lofty and fiery thoughts, the bright glow of his will, his lofty\r\nvocation. Govinda knew that Siddhartha would never become a mediocre\r\nbrahmin, no lazy officiator of sacrifices, no greedy peddler of magic\r\nspells, no rhetorician of vain and empty speech, no sly or malevolent\r\npriest, and also never become a good but stupid sheep in the flock of\r\nmany. No, and he too, Govinda, had no wish to become one such, not one of\r\nthose brahmans that are numbered in their thousands. He wanted to be a\r\nfollower of Siddhartha, the beloved, the noble. And if Siddhartha ever\r\nbecame a god, if he ever went to join the luminous ones, then Govinda\r\nwould follow him, as his friend, as his companion, as his servant, as his\r\nspear carrier, his shadow.\r\n\r\nEveryone loved Siddhartha in the same way. To everyone he brought joy.\r\n\r\nTo himself, though, Siddhartha did not bring joy. Wandering between the\r\nroses in the fig garden, sitting in the bluish shade in the grove of\r\ncontemplation, washing his limbs in his daily act of atonement, performing\r\nsacrifice in the dark shade of the mango wood, all his movements as they\r\nshould be, loved by all, joy to all, he nonetheless carried no joy in his\r\nown heart. Tears came to him, restless thoughts came to him from the water\r\nof the river as it flowed, from the stars of the night as they sparkled,\r\nfrom the rays of the Sun as they blazed, dreams came to him and a\r\nrestlessness of the soul, from the smoke of his sacrifices, from the\r\nverses of the Rig Veda as he breathed them, from the teachings of the\r\nancient brahmins as they seeped into him.\r\n\r\nSiddhartha had begun to nurture discontent in himself. He had begun to\r\nfeel that his father’s love, and his mother’s love, and the love of\r\nhis friend, Govinda, would not always and for all time bring him\r\nhappiness, calm him, satisfy him, be enough for him. He had begun to see\r\nthat his venerable father and his other teachers, the wise brahmins, had\r\nalready given him almost all of their wisdom, all the best of their\r\nwisdom, that their fullness had already been poured into his vessel,\r\nreceptive and ready to accept it, and that the vessel was not full, the\r\nspirit was not satisfied, the soul was not quieted, the heart was not at\r\npeace. The washings were good, but they were water, they did not wash sins\r\naway, they did not assuage the thirst of the soul, they did not dispel the\r\npain of the heart. Most important of all were the sacrifices and the call\r\nof the gods - but was that all? Did the sacrifices bring happiness? And\r\nhow did the gods feel about that? Was it really Prajapati who had created\r\nthe world? Was it not Atman, him, the only one, the all-in-one? Were the\r\ngods not forms that had been created like you and me, subject to time,\r\nmortal? So was it good to make sacrifice to the gods, was it proper, was\r\nit a meaningful and elevated act? Whom else would you make sacrifice to,\r\nwhom else should you offer your veneration to other than Him, the one and\r\nonly, Atman? And where was Atman to be found, where did He live, where did\r\nHis eternal heart beat, where else but in the Self, in the Deepest, in the\r\nIndestructible that every man carried in himself? But where, where was\r\nthis Self, this Deepest, this Ultimate? It was not made of flesh and bone,\r\nit was not thought or consciousness, that is was the wisest men taught.\r\nWhere, where was it then? To pierce through to the Self, to me, to Atman -\r\nwas there any other way worth seeking out? But no-one showed him this way,\r\nno-one knew it, not his father, not his teachers or the wise men, not the\r\nsacred songs of sacrifice! They knew everything, the brahmins and their\r\nholy books, knew everything, they had made great efforts into everything\r\nand into more than everything, the creation of the world, the origins of\r\nspeech, food, breathing in and breathing out, the hierarchy of sins, the\r\nacts of the gods - their knowledge was boundless - but was it worth\r\nknowing all of this when there was one single thing they did not know, the\r\nthing of highest importance, the only thing of importance?\r\n\r\nIt was true that many verses in the holy scriptures, magnificent verses\r\nsuch as the Upanishads of the Samaveda, spoke of this deepest and ultimate\r\nthing. “Your soul is the entire world,” was written there, and it was\r\nwritten that man in his sleep, deep sleep, enters into his deepest part\r\nand lives in Atman. Great wisdom was written in these verses, all the\r\nknowledge of the wisest was collected here and presented in words of\r\nmagic, as pure as the honey collected from the bees. No, the enormous\r\namount of knowledge here, assembled and preserved through countless\r\ngenerations of wise brahmins, was not to be under-valued. - but where were\r\nthe brahmins, where were the priests, where were the wise men and the\r\npenitents who had succeeded not only in learning this deepest wisdom but\r\nin living it? Where was the gifted one who, by his magic, would draw the\r\nessence of Atman out of its sleep and make it alert, something that was\r\nalive in its coming and going, in word and deed? Siddhartha knew many\r\nvenerable brahmins, most of all he knew his father, the pure one, the\r\nlearned one, the most venerable of all. His father was an admirable man,\r\nquiet and noble in his manner, pure his life, wise his words, in his brow\r\nlived fine and noble thoughts - but even he, who had so much knowledge;\r\nDid he live in holiness, was he at peace, was he, too, not just another\r\nseeker, just another thirsty one? Did he not, over and again, need to go\r\nto the well to assuage his thirst, did he not need to make sacrifice, read\r\nbooks and debate his beliefs with the brahmins? Why did he, the immaculate\r\none, need to wash his sins away every day, strive to become pure every\r\nday, every day again and again? Was Atman not a part of him, did the\r\nsource not flow into his heart? The source of all things had to be found,\r\nthe source within us all, it had to be taken into ourselves! All else was\r\nmere seeking, mere straying from the path, mere delusion.\r\n\r\nThese were the thoughts of Siddhartha, this was his thirst, this was his\r\nsorrow.\r\n\r\nHe would often recite the words from one of the Chandogya Upanishads:\r\n“Forsooth, the name of Brahman is Satyam - forsooth, he who knows such\r\nthings goeth daily into the world of Heaven.” The world of Heaven often\r\nseemed near to him, but he had never quite been able to reach it, never\r\nbeen able to quench the ultimate thirst. And from all the wise men he\r\nknew, even from the wisest of all, whose teachings he enjoyed, there was\r\nnot one who ever had quite reached it, the world of Heaven, which would\r\nhave quenched the ultimate thirst for him.\r\n\r\n“Govinda,” said Siddhartha to his friend, “Govinda, dear friend,\r\ncome with me under the banyan tree, we have to nurture our skill of\r\ncontemplation.”\r\n\r\nThey went to the Banyan tree, they sat down beneath it, Siddhartha here\r\nand, twenty paces away, sat Govinda. As he sat down in preparedness to\r\nutter the word ‘Om,’ Siddhartha repeatedly muttered the verse:\r\n\r\n  Om is the bow, the arrow is the soul,\r\n  Brahman is the arrow’s goal,\r\n  The goal to reach directly.\r\n\r\nAfter they had practised contemplation for their usual length of time\r\nGovinda stood. The evening had come, it was time to wash in preparation\r\nfor the evening. He called out Siddhartha’s name. Siddhartha gave no\r\nanswer. Siddhartha sat deep in contemplation, his eyes were fixed on a\r\ngreatly distant object, the tip of his tongue protruded slightly from\r\nbetween his teeth, he seemed not to be breathing. So he sat, engrossed in\r\ncontemplation, his mind fixed on Om, his soul as the arrow sent out to\r\nBrahman.\r\n\r\nOne day samanas came through the town where Siddhartha lived, travelling\r\nascetics, three men wizened and close to death, neither old nor young,\r\ntheir shoulders were bloody and dusty, they were nearly naked and they\r\nwere scorched by the sun, an air of loneliness about them, alien to this\r\nworld and the enemy of the world, strangers, emaciated jackals in the\r\nempire of man. The odour of quiet suffering blew in from behind them, of\r\nservice that destroyed, of pitiless loss of self.\r\n\r\nThat evening, after their hour of contemplation, Siddhartha said to\r\nGovinda, “Tomorrow morning, my friend, Siddhartha will go to the\r\nsamanas. He will become a samana.”\r\n\r\nWhen Govinda heard these words and saw the unshakable resolution in his\r\nfriend’s face he turned pale. Siddhartha could no more be dissuaded from\r\nhis course than the arrow speeding from the bow. Just as soon as he saw\r\nthis, Govinda knew that this was where it started, Siddhartha would now go\r\non his way, now his destiny would begin to grow, and with Siddhartha’s\r\ndestiny so would Govinda’s. And he became as pale as a dried banana\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nOh, Siddhartha,” he exclaimed, “will your father allow that?”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha looked back at him as one who was awakening. With the speed of\r\nan arrow he saw the fear, saw the resignation in Govinda’s soul.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Govinda,” he said gently, “let us not waste words. Tomorrow, at\r\nthe break of day, I will embark on the life of a samana. Let us talk no\r\nmore about it.”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha went into the room where his father sat on a raffia mat and\r\nstood behind him until his father could feel that he was there. The\r\nbrahmin said, “Is that you, Siddhartha? Say what it is you have come to\r\ntell me.”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha answered, “If you will allow it, father, I have come to tell\r\nyou that I have been called on to leave your house in the morning and to\r\ngo among the ascetics. It is my vocation to become a samana. I hope my\r\nfather will not be opposed to this.”\r\n\r\nThe brahmin was silent, and remained silent so long that, before the\r\nsilence in the room came to an end, the stars outside the little window\r\nhad moved across the sky and formed new shapes. His son remained there,\r\nspeechless and immobile, his arms crossed, the father sat there on the\r\nmat, speechless and immobile, while the stars made their way across the\r\nsky. Finally, Siddhartha’s father spoke. “It is not seemly for a\r\nbrahmin to speak loud and angry words, but my heart is moved to oppose\r\nthis. I do not want to hear this request from your mouth a second time.”\r\n\r\nSlowly, the brahmin got to his feet, Siddhartha stood in silence, his arms\r\ncrossed.\r\n\r\n“What are you waiting for?” his father asked.\r\n\r\nSiddhartha said, “You know what I am waiting for.”\r\n\r\nDispleased, his father left the room, displeased he went to his bed and\r\nlay himself down.\r\n\r\nAn hour passed, as no sleep came to his eyes, the brahmin stood up, paced\r\nto and fro, left the house. He looked in through the little window of the\r\nroom, there he saw Siddhartha standing, his arms crossed, unchanged. His\r\nupper clothing shone palely. Unease in his heart, Siddhartha’s father\r\nwent back to his bed.\r\n\r\nAnother hour passed, as no sleep came to his eyes, the brahmin stood up\r\nagain, paced to and fro, went to the front of the house, saw that the moon\r\nhad risen. He looked in through the little window of the room, there he\r\nsaw Siddhartha standing, resolute, his arms crossed, moonlight reflecting\r\nfrom his bare legs. With worry in his heart, Siddhartha’s father went\r\nback to his bed.\r\n\r\nHe came again after an hour, and came again after two hours, looked in at\r\nthe little window, saw Siddhartha standing there, in the moonlight, in the\r\nstarlight, in the darkness. He came again hour after hour, in silence,\r\nlooked into the room, saw the resolute one standing there, it filled his\r\nheart with anger, filled his heart with anxiety, filled his heart with\r\ndoubts, filled it with sorrow.\r\n\r\nAnd in the last hour of the night, before the day began, he went back\r\nagain, entered the room, saw the young man standing there. He seemed great\r\nto him, and like a stranger.\r\n\r\n“Siddhartha,” he said, “what is it you are waiting for?”\r\n\r\n“You know what I am waiting for.”\r\n\r\n“Will you persist in standing like this and waiting until day comes,\r\nmidday comes, evening comes?”\r\n\r\n“I will stand and wait.”\r\n\r\n“You will become tired, Siddhartha.”\r\n\r\n“I will become tired.”\r\n\r\n“You will fall asleep, Siddhartha.”\r\n\r\n“I will not fall asleep.”\r\n\r\n“You will die, Siddhartha.”\r\n\r\n“I will die.”\r\n\r\n“And would you rather die than do as your father tells you?”\r\n\r\n“Siddhartha has always done as his father has told him.”\r\n\r\n“So will you give up this idea?”\r\n\r\n“Siddhartha will do as his father says.”\r\n\r\nThe first rays of daylight fell into the room. The brahmin saw that\r\nSiddhartha’s knees were trembling slightly. He saw no tremble in\r\nSiddhartha’s face, his eyes fixed on the far distance. Then his father\r\nrealised that Siddhartha was no longer with him in his native country,\r\nthat he had already left him.\r\n\r\nHis father touched Siddhartha’s shoulder.\r\n\r\n“You will go into the woods and become a samana,” he said. “If you\r\nfind holiness in the woods come and teach me about holiness. If you find\r\ndisappointment come back and we can make sacrifices to the gods together\r\nagain. Now go and kiss your mother, tell her where you’re going. For me,\r\nit is time now to go down to the river and start the first washing of the\r\nday.”\r\n\r\nHe took his hand off his son’s shoulder and went out. Siddhartha\r\nstaggered to one side as he tried to walk. He forced his limbs to do as he\r\nwanted, bowed to his father and went to his mother to do as his father had\r\ntold him.\r\n\r\nThe town, in the light of early morning, was still quiet as Siddhartha\r\nwalked out of it, moving slowly on his stiff legs. As he passed the last\r\nhut a shadow rose from where it had been crouching and approached the\r\npilgrim - Govinda.\r\n\r\n“You have come,” said Siddhartha with a smile.\r\n\r\n“I have come,” said Govinda.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMONG THE SAMANAS\r\n\r\nThey reached the samanas that evening, the emaciated samanas, and offered\r\nthem their company and their obedience. They were accepted.\r\n\r\nSiddhartha had given his coat to a poor brahmin on the way there. All he\r\nwore now were his loin cloth and an earth coloured, untailored cloak. He\r\nate just once a day and never had cooked food. He fasted for fifteen days.\r\nHe fasted for twenty-eight days. The flesh disappeared from his limbs and\r\nhis cheeks. Feverish dreams flickered from his bulging eyes, the nails\r\ngrew long on his desiccated fingers, a dry, unkempt beard. When he\r\nencountered a woman his eyes became icy; his mouth twitched with contempt\r\nwhen he entered a town and saw the people in their fine clothes. He saw\r\nbusinessmen doing business, he saw noblemen go hunting, he saw the\r\nbereaved grieving for their dead, whores offering their bodies, doctors\r\ntaking care of the sick, priests saying when to sow crops, lovers loving,\r\nmothers feeding their babies - and none of this was worth a glance from\r\nhim, all was lies, everything stank, everything stank of lies, everything\r\nmade a pretence of good sense and happiness and beauty, all was in decay\r\nand none could see it. The world tasted bitter. Life was a torment.\r\n\r\nSiddhartha had but one objective: to empty himself, to empty himself of\r\nthirst, of desire, of dreams, empty himself of joy and sorrow. To die away\r\nfrom himself, to no longer be himself, to find peace by emptying his own\r\nheart, to stand open to the miracle by alienating his own thoughts, that\r\nwas his objective. Once the whole of his self had been overcome and\r\ndestroyed, once every need and every drive of his heart was silent, that\r\nwas when the ultimate had to wake, the deepest part of his being, that\r\nwhich is no longer the self, the great secret.\r\n\r\nSiddhartha stood silent in the vertical glare of the Sun, aglow with pain,\r\naglow with thirst, and he stood there till he no longer felt pain nor\r\nthirst. He stood silent in the time of rains with the water flowing from\r\nhis hair onto his icy cold shoulders, over his icy cold hips and legs, and\r\nthe penitent remained standing there till his shoulders and his legs no\r\nlonger felt icy cold, till they became silent, till they were at peace. He\r\ncrouched silent in the thorny bushes, blood dropping from his burning\r\nskin, pus dropping from his wounds, and Siddhartha remained rigid,\r\nremained motionless, till the blood no longer flowed, till the thorns no\r\nlonger pierced his skin, till nothing more burned him.\r\n\r\nSiddhartha sat up straight and learned to control his breath, learned to\r\nneed little air, learned to stop his breath. He learned, starting with his\r\nbreath, to still the beats of his heart, learned to reduce the beats of\r\nhis heart till they became fewer and then till there were almost none.\r\n\r\nSiddhartha was taught by the eldest of the samanas, he trained in losing\r\nthe self, he trained in contemplation, learned new samana rules. A heron\r\nflew out of the bamboo forest - and Siddhartha took the heron into his\r\nsoul, he flew over the woods and mountains, he was a heron, he ate fish,\r\nhe hungered as a heron hungers, he spoke the heron language, he died the\r\ndeath of a heron. A dead jackal lay on the sand by the water, and\r\nSiddhartha’s soul slipped into the corpse, he was entirely a jackal, he\r\nlay on the shore, he bloated with gas, he stank, he decayed, he was torn\r\napart by hyenas, he lost his skin to the vultures, he became a skeleton,\r\nbecame dust, blew in the wind that crossed the meadows. And Siddhartha’s\r\nsoul came back to him, died, decayed, crumbled, it had tasted the dark\r\ninebriation of the circle of life, again endured thirst like the hunter in\r\nthe wasteland where the circle of life might be left behind, where cause\r\nand effect ended, where eternity without pain began. He brought death to\r\nhis senses, brought death to his memory, slipped out of his own self and\r\ninto a thousand alien forms, he was an animal, was carrion, was stone, was\r\nwood, was water, and each time found himself ever more aware, light of sun\r\nor moon, became again himself, swang in the circle, felt thirst, overcame\r\nthe thirst, felt the thirst anew.\r\n\r\nAmong the samanas Siddhartha learned many things, he learned many ways to\r\nleave his self behind. He learned the way of self-alienation by pain, by\r\nvoluntary suffering and how to overcome pain, hunger, thirst, fatigue. He\r\ntravelled on the way of self-alienation by meditation, by removing from\r\nhis thoughts any sense that he was perceiving what presented itself to\r\nhim. This he learned, and he learned many other ways to travel, he left\r\nhis self behind a thousand times, he persisted in the not-self for hours,\r\nfor days. But although these ways led him away from his self they always,\r\nat the end, led him back to it. Siddhartha fled from his self a thousand\r\ntimes, spent time in nothingness, in the animal, in a stone, but he was\r\nnever able to prevent his return, the hour of his return was not\r\navoidable, and he would find himself, once again, in the light of the sun\r\nor the moon, in shade or in rain, and Siddhartha and his self were there\r\nonce again, once again the suffering of the circle of life was placed upon\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAt his side lived Govinda, his shadow, travelling the same road,\r\nundergoing the same trials. They seldom spoke to each other, only when it\r\nwas needed for their service and their exercises. At times they would go\r\ntogether to the villages in order to beg for food for themselves and their\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\n“What do you think, Govinda,” Siddhartha once asked him as they were\r\non their way to beg. “Do you think we have made any progress? Have we\r\nreached any of our targets?”\r\n\r\nGovinda answered, “We have learned things, and we continue to learn. You\r\nwill be a great samana, Siddhartha. You have learned every exercise very\r\nquickly, and the old samanas have been amazed at you. One day, Siddhartha,\r\nyou will be a holy man.”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha said, “That is not how I see it, my friend. All that I have\r\nlearned so far I could have learned much faster and much easier in any bar\r\nwhere the whores are, my friend, among all the cheats and the gamblers.”\r\n\r\nGovinda said, “That is what you say, my friend, but you know that\r\nSiddhartha is not some cattle driver, and that a samana is not some\r\ndrunkard. The drunk can numb his senses, he can find escape and rest for a\r\nshort time, but then he comes back from his stupor and finds that all is\r\nas it was before. He makes himself no wiser, he has gathered no knowledge\r\nany sort, he has climbed not one step higher.”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha smiled and said, “I don’t know, I’ve never been a\r\ndrunkard. But I do know that in all my exercises and contemplations I have\r\nonly ever found a brief respite from suffering, and remained just as far\r\naway from wisdom and liberation as a child in its mother’s womb. I do\r\nknow that, Govinda, I do know that.”\r\n\r\nAnother time, when Siddhartha and Govinda came out of the woods together\r\nand down to the village to beg for food for their brothers and teachers,\r\nSiddhartha began to speak and said, “What about now, Govinda, do you\r\nthink we are on the right path? Are we getting any closer to knowledge?\r\nAre we getting any closer to liberation? Or are we just going round in\r\ncircles - we, who are trying to escape the circle of life?”\r\n\r\nGovinda said, “We have learnt many things, Siddhartha, and there is\r\nstill a lot more to learn. We are not going round in circles, we are\r\nmounting higher, the circle is a spiral, we have already climbed up many\r\nsteps.”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha answered, “How old do you think our eldest samana is, our\r\nvenerable teacher?”\r\n\r\nGovinda said, “He must be about sixty, our eldest samana.”\r\n\r\nAnd Siddhartha, “He has reached the age of sixty, and he still has not\r\nreached Nirvana. He will be seventy, and then eighty, and you and me, we\r\nwill become old in the same way and we will do our exercises, and we will\r\nfast, and we will meditate. But we will never reach Nirvana, he will not,\r\nwe will not. Govinda, of all the samanas that there are, I do not think\r\nany one of them is likely to reach Nirvana. We find consolation, we find\r\nrespite from pain, we learn the skills with which we deceive ourselves.\r\nBut that which is essential, the way of ways, that is what we are not\r\nfinding.”\r\n\r\n“Do not utter such shocking words, Siddhartha!” said Govinda. “We\r\nare among so many learned men, so many brahmins, so many strict and\r\nvenerable samanas, so many seekers, so many who strive with such effort,\r\nso many holy men; how could it be that none of these finds the way of\r\nways?”\r\n\r\nBut Siddhartha replied in a voice that was sad as much as it was mocking,\r\na gentle voice, a somewhat sad voice, somewhat mocking, “Soon now,\r\nGovinda, your friend will be leaving the way of the samanas along which he\r\nhas travelled so far with you. I suffer from thirst, Govinda, and my\r\nthirst has not become any the less on this long way of the samanas. I have\r\nalways been thirsty for knowledge, always been full of questions. I\r\nquestioned the brahmins year after year, I sought knowledge in the holy\r\nvedas year after year, and I put questions to the pious samanas year after\r\nyear. Perhaps, Govinda, it would have been just as good, just as clever\r\nand just as healing to go and put questions to the rhinoceros birds or the\r\nchimpanzees. I have taken much time to learn this, Govinda, and I am still\r\nnot at the end of it, I have learned that learning is impossible! I\r\nbelieve that in fact there is nothing in anything that we could call\r\n‘learning.’ There is only a kind of knowledge that is everywhere, my\r\nfriend, and that is Atman. Atman is in me and in everything else that has\r\nexistence. And so now I am beginning to believe that this knowledge has no\r\nworse enemy than the pursuit of knowledge, than learning.”\r\n\r\nAt this, Govinda stopped walking, raised his hands and said,\r\n“Siddhartha, please do not make your friend anxious with talk like this!\r\nWhat you are saying really does make me anxious in my heart. Think what\r\nyou are saying; where would that leave the holiness of prayer, where would\r\nthat leave the dignity of being a brahmin, where would that leave the\r\nholiness of the samanas if it were as you say, if it were not possible\r\never to learn?! Siddhartha, where would that leave anything on Earth that\r\nis holy or valuable or venerable?!”\r\n\r\nGovinda quietly muttered a verse, a verse from one of the Upanishads:\r\n\r\nThe purest soul that deeply thinks and sinks itself in Atman, His blessed\r\nheart will have no words to tell it to the world.\r\n\r\nSiddhartha, though, remained silent. He thought about the words that\r\nGovinda had just said to him, he thought about the words to their end.\r\n\r\nYes, he thought as he stood there with his head lowered, what would be\r\nleft of all the things that seem holy to us? What would remain? What would\r\nbe preserved? And he shook his head.\r\n\r\nAt an earlier time, when the two young men had lived with the samanas, and\r\nperformed their exercises together for about three years, there came to\r\nthem through many ways and turnings a message, a rumour, saying; One has\r\nappeared that will be called Gotama, the noble one, the buddha. He will\r\nhave overcome the pain of the world in himself and brought the wheel of\r\nrebirth to a halt. With his followers he travels through the land,\r\nteaching as he goes, without property, without a home, without a wife,\r\nwearing the yellow garb of an ascetic but with joy on his brow, a holy\r\nman, and brahmans and princes bow their knee to him and become his pupils.\r\n\r\nThis legend, this rumour, this folk tale sounded out, raised itself like a\r\nscent far and wide, brahmins spoke of it in the cities, samanas spoke of\r\nit in the woods, the name of Gotama, the buddha, was repeated over and\r\nagain in the ears of the young, in the good and in the evil, in praise and\r\nin contempt.\r\n\r\nAs when the plague is raging through a country and a rumour arises that\r\nsomewhere there is a man, a wise man, a knowledgeable man whose word and\r\nwhose breath alone is enough to heal anyone afflicted with it, when this\r\nrumour spreads through the land and all are talking of it, many believe\r\nit, many doubt it, but many set themselves straight on the road to seek\r\nout this wise man who can help them, so it was with the fragrant rumour of\r\nGotama, the buddha, the wise man from the line of the sakyas. He\r\npossessed, so the believers said, the highest enlightenment, he remembered\r\nhis previous lives, he had attained nirvana and would never more come back\r\nto the cycle of rebirth, never more submerge in the dark waters that\r\ncarried the forms of the lower world. Many things majestic and incredible\r\nwere reported of him, he had performed miracles, had overcome the Devil,\r\nhad spoken with the gods. His enemies, however, and those who did not\r\nbelieve, said that this Gotama was a vain seducer, he spent his days in\r\ncomfort, despised the acts of sacrifice, was without learning and\r\nperformed neither exercise nor self-castigation.\r\n\r\nSweet was this legend of the buddha, magical was the aroma of these\r\nrumours. Diseased was the world, hard to bear was life - and look, there\r\nappeared to flow water from a new spring, a call of good news seemed to be\r\nheard, reassuring, mild, and full of noble promises. Everywhere that the\r\nrumour of the buddha was heard, in every part of the lands of India, the\r\nyoung men listened, felt longing, felt hope, and every pilgrim or stranger\r\nwho came to the sons of brahmins in the towns and villages with news of\r\nhim, the noble one, the sakyamuni, was welcome.\r\n\r\nThis legend even penetrated into the woods where the samanas lived, even\r\nto Siddhartha, even to Govinda, slowly, drop by drop, each drop laden with\r\nhope, each drop laden with doubt. They seldom spoke of it, as the eldest\r\nof the samanas was no friend of this legend. He had been taught that\r\nanyone who seemed to be a buddha had first become an ascetic and lived in\r\nthe woods, and only then returned to the world of comfort and gaiety, and\r\nhe had no faith in this Gotama at all.\r\n\r\n“Siddhartha,” said Govinda to his friend one day. “I was in the\r\nvillage today and a brahman invited me into his house, and in his house\r\nwas a brahmin’s son from Magadha who had seen this buddha with his own\r\neyes and listened to his teachings. At that, the very breath in my lungs\r\ntruly caused me pain and I thought: I too would like, both of us,\r\nSiddhartha and I, would like to experience these teachings, to learn from\r\nthe mouth of one who had attained perfection! Tell me, my friend, should\r\nwe not go and learn from the mouth of this buddha himself?”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha answered, “Oh, Govinda, I had always thought Govinda would\r\nstay with the samanas, it was always my belief that it was his objective\r\nto live to the age of sixty or seventy and always practise the arts and\r\nexercises that the samanas display. But look at me now, I did not know\r\nGovinda well enough, I knew little of his heart. But now, dear friend, now\r\nyou want to set out on a new path and go there, where the buddha spreads\r\nhis teachings.”\r\n\r\nGovinda answered, “You like to laugh at me. I hope you always keep\r\nlaughing, Siddhartha! But do you not also feel the desire to hear these\r\nteachings rising within you, the wish to hear what is said? And did you\r\nnot once say to me that you would not stay for long among the samanas to\r\nfollow their way?”\r\n\r\nAt this Siddhartha laughed, in his way of laughing that took on a shadow\r\nof sorrow and a shadow of mockery, and said, “Quite right, Govinda, what\r\nyou say is quite right, you have remembered it rightly. But maybe you\r\nshould also remember something else you heard from me, that I had become\r\ntired and mistrustful of teachings and learning, and that my beliefs have\r\nlittle faith in the words that come to us from teachers. But anyway, my\r\nfriend, I am willing to come and hear these teachings - even though, in my\r\nheart, I think we have already tasted the best fruits of them.”\r\n\r\nGovinda answered, “Your readiness brings joy to my heart. But tell me,\r\nhow can that be possible? How could the teachings of Gotama have given us\r\ntheir best fruits even before we have tasted them?”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha answered, “Let us enjoy these fruits and wait to see what\r\nhappens, Govinda! But we can already be thankful to Gotama in that his\r\nfruits are calling us away from the samanas! Perhaps he has other fruit to\r\noffer, and better fruit my friend. Let us keep peace in our hearts and\r\nwait to see if this is so.”\r\n\r\nThat very day Siddhartha told the eldest of the samanas of his decision to\r\nleave him. He told him with all the humility and modesty as befits a\r\njunior and a pupil. The samana, however fell into a rage at the young\r\nmen’s decision to leave, he raised his voice and used foul language.\r\n\r\nGovinda was shocked and embarrassed, but Siddhartha put his mouth to\r\nGovinda’s ear and whispered, “Now I will show the elder that I have\r\nlearned something from him.”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha stood close in front of the samana, gathered his own spirit,\r\ncaptured the gaze of the old man with his own gaze, and thereby did he\r\nenthrall him, made him dumb, deprived him of his will, subjected him to\r\nhis own will, and without a word he ordered him to do as he commanded. The\r\nold man was unable to speak, unable to move his eyes, unable to direct his\r\nown will, his arms hung loose, he became powerless and was subject to the\r\nmagic worked by Siddhartha. Siddhartha’s thoughts overpowered those of\r\nthe samana, he had to carry out whatever commands they gave him. And so\r\nthe old man bowed down several times, performed gestures of blessing and\r\nhumbly stammered out wishes for a good journey. And the young men replied\r\nby thanking him for his prostrations, thanked him for his good wishes and\r\nwith those greetings made their departure.\r\n\r\nOn the way Govinda said, “Oh Siddhartha, you learned more from the\r\nsamanas than I had realised. It is not easy, not easy at all, to bewitch\r\nan ancient samana. I am sure that if you had stayed with them you would\r\nsoon have learned to walk on water.”\r\n\r\n“Why would I want to walk on water?” said Siddhartha. “If the\r\nancient samanas want to do tricks like that they can keep them!”\r\n\r\n\r\nGOTAMA\r\n\r\nIn the city of Savathi every child knew the name of the noble buddha, and\r\nevery house was ready to fill the begging bowls of Gotama’s disciples\r\nwhen they made their silent requests. Near the city was the grove of\r\nJetavana. This wood had been given to Gotama and his followers by\r\nAnathapindika, a rich businessman who was devoted to the noble one, and it\r\nwas the place that Gotama liked to visit most.\r\n\r\nAll the stories and all the answers that the two young ascetics had heard\r\nin their search for Gotama had directed them to this place. When they\r\narrived in Savathi they stood at the door of the first house silently\r\nbegging for food, which was given them. Siddhartha asked the woman who had\r\noffered them the food:\r\n\r\n“Generous lady, we would like to learn where the most venerable one, the\r\nbuddha, spends his time, for we are two samanas from the woods and have\r\ncome to see him, the perfect one, and to hear the teachings from his\r\nmouth.”\r\n\r\nThe woman said, “You have certainly arrived at the right place, samanas\r\nfrom the woods. You should know that Jetavana, the garden of\r\nAnathapindikas, is where the noble one spends his time. You will be able\r\nto spend the night there, pilgrims, as there is even enough room there for\r\nthe countless many who flood to this place to hear the teachings from his\r\nmouth.”\r\n\r\nThis was pleasing news to Govinda, and full of joy he declared, “That is\r\ngood, so we have reached our destination and our journey is at its end!\r\nBut tell us, mother of pilgrims, do you know him, the buddha, have you\r\nseen him with your own eyes?”\r\n\r\nThe woman said, “Many have seen him, the noble one. Many times I have\r\nseen him as he went on his way through the streets and alleys, silent in\r\nhis yellow robes, silent as he showed his begging bowl at the doors of\r\nhouses and, as he left those places, his begging bowl full.”\r\n\r\nGovinda listened with joy and wanted to put many questions and to hear\r\nmore. But Siddhartha urged that they should go on their way. They said\r\nthank you and left, and had hardly any need to ask the way for many\r\npilgrims were on their way to Jetavana, as well as monks from Gotama’s\r\ncommunity. They arrived there in the night time, there was a continuous\r\nflow of visitors arriving, calling to each other, talking about who was\r\nlooking for shelter and who had found it. The two samanas, used to life in\r\nthe woods, found a place to rest quickly and quietly and remained there\r\ntill morning.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun rose they were astonished to see the size of the crowd,\r\nbelievers or the curious, who had spent the night here. Monks in their\r\nyellow robes wandered along all the paths of the beautiful grove, here and\r\nthere under the trees sat people deep in meditation or engaged in\r\nspiritual discussion. The shady garden was like a city, full of people\r\nswarming like bees. Most of the monks were leaving with their begging\r\nbowls in order to collect food for midday, when they would have their only\r\nmeal of the day. Even the buddha himself, the enlightened one, made a\r\nhabit of going out to beg each morning.\r\n\r\nSiddhartha saw him, and as quickly as if he had been pointed out by a god,\r\nhe knew who it was. He saw him, a slight man in a yellow cloak, making his\r\nquiet way with his begging bowl in his hand.\r\n\r\n“Govinda, look!” whispered Siddhartha. “Just there, that is the\r\nbuddha.”\r\n\r\nGovinda stared at the monk in the yellow robe, indistinguishable from the\r\nhundreds of other monks there. And soon Govinda could see it too: it was\r\nhim. And they followed him and kept him in their sight.\r\n\r\nThe buddha followed his path with humility and deep in thought, the\r\npeaceful expression on his face was neither gay nor sad, it seemed to show\r\na gentle inward contentment. With a hidden smile, quiet, peaceful, not\r\nunlike a healthy child, the buddha wandered on, wearing his robes and\r\nplacing his feet in the same way as all his monks, in the way that was\r\nprescribed. But his face, his gait, his quiet lowered eyes, his hands\r\nhanging quietly from his arms, and even every finger on his quietly\r\nhanging hands spoke of peace, spoke of perfection, sought nothing, copied\r\nnothing, breathed gently with a peace that could not fade, in a light that\r\ncould not fade, a peace that could not be touched.\r\n\r\nSo, Gotama walked on slowly towards the town where he would gather alms,\r\nand the two samanas knew him simply from the perfection of his peace, the\r\nstillness of his form where no searching, no desire, no imitation, no\r\nstriving could be seen, only light and peace.\r\n\r\n“Today, we will hear the teachings from his own mouth,” said Govinda.\r\n\r\nSiddhartha made no answer. He had less curiosity about the teachings, he\r\ndid not believe they would teach him anything new, even though, like\r\nGovinda, he had heard many times about what the teachings of this buddha\r\ncontained, albeit from the reports he had heard at second or third hand.\r\nBut he looked attentively at Gotama’s head, at his shoulders, at his\r\nfeet, at his hand as it hung there without moving, and it seemed to him\r\nthat every part of every finger of that hand held a lesson, spoke,\r\nbreathed, was fragrant and shone with truth. This man, this buddha, was\r\ntruthful down to every movement of every finger. This man was holy.\r\nSiddhartha had never felt such veneration for anyone, he had never loved\r\nanyone as much as this man.\r\n\r\nThe two of them followed the buddha into the town and then they quietly\r\nturned back, as they too hoped to obtain food for themselves before the\r\nend of day. They saw Gotama as he too came back, saw him surrounded by his\r\nfollowers as they took their meal - what he ate was not enough to feed a\r\nbird - and they saw him withdraw into the shade of the mango trees.\r\n\r\nBut when evening came, when the heat of the day had lessened and everyone\r\nin the camp became more active and gathered together, they heard the\r\nbuddha speak. They heard his voice, and even that was a thing of\r\nperfection, of perfect stillness, of complete peace. Gotama taught the\r\nlesson of suffering, of the origin of suffering, of the way that leads to\r\nthe removal of suffering. His speech flowed on, calm, peaceful and clear,\r\nit was. Life was sorrow, the world was full of suffering, but release from\r\nsuffering could be found: release would be found by him who followed the\r\nway of the buddha. The noble one spoke in a voice that was gentle but\r\nfirm, he taught of the four principal doctrines, he taught of the\r\neight-fold path, the circle of reincarnation, his voice, clear and quiet,\r\nremained above his listeners like a light, like a star in the firmament.\r\n\r\nNight had fallen before the buddha came to the end of his speech. Many\r\npilgrims came forward and asked to be accepted into his community, sought\r\nrefuge in the teachings. Gotama did accept them, with the words, “You\r\nhave ingested the teachings well, they were conveyed to you well. Come,\r\nthen, among us and walk in holiness, that you may prepare an end to all\r\nsorrow.”\r\n\r\nThen Govinda, too, the shy one, was seen to come forward and he said,\r\n“I, too, seek refuge with the noble one and his teachings,” and asked\r\nto be accepted among the buddha’s followers, and he was accepted.\r\n\r\nSoon thereafter, as the buddha had withdrawn for his night’s rest,\r\nGovinda went to Siddhartha with great enthusiasm and said, “I am not\r\nentitled to reproach you for anything. We have both heard the noble one,\r\nwe have both received his teachings. Govinda heard the teaching, he has\r\ntaken refuge in them. But you, revered one, will you not take the path of\r\nliberation? Will you delay, will you continue to wait?”\r\n\r\nWhen he realised what Govinda had said Siddhartha woke as if he had been\r\nsleeping. Then, gently and with no mockery in his voice, he said,\r\n“Govinda, my friend, now you have taken the first step, now you have\r\nchosen your path. You have always been my friend, Govinda, you have always\r\nfollowed me one step behind. I have often asked myself whether Govinda\r\nwould one day take a step of his own, without me, from his own soul. Now\r\nsee, you have become a man and chosen your own way. I hope you will follow\r\nit to its end, my friend! I hope you will find liberation!”\r\n\r\nGovinda still did not fully understand, and impatiently repeated his\r\nquestion: “Speak, dear friend, I beg of you, speak! Tell me what cannot\r\nbe different, tell me my learned friend that you too will take refuge with\r\nthe noble buddha!”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha lay his hand on Govinda’s shoulder. “You have failed to\r\nhear my deepest wish for you, Govinda. I will repeat if for you: I hope\r\nyou will follow your path to its end, my friend! I hope you will find\r\nliberation!”\r\n\r\nAt that moment Govinda saw that his friend had left him, and he began to\r\nweep.\r\n\r\n“Siddhartha!” he implored.\r\n\r\nSiddhartha’s reply was friendly. “Govinda, do not forget that you now\r\nare one of the samanas of the buddha. You have forsaken your home and your\r\nparents, forsaken origins and possessions, by your own free will you have\r\nforsaken friendship. This is what is said in the teachings, this is what\r\nis said by the buddha. This is what you have chosen for yourself.\r\nTomorrow, Govinda, I will leave you.”\r\n\r\nThe two friends wandered long among the trees, long they lay but found no\r\nsleep. And Govinda asked his friend over and over again why he would not\r\ntake refuge in the teachings of Gotama, what fault could he find in these\r\nteachings. But Siddharth always rejected his insistence and said, “Learn\r\nto be in peace, Govinda. The teachings of the noble one are very good. How\r\nshould I find any fault in them?”\r\n\r\nAs morning was breaking one of the buddha’s followers, one of his eldest\r\nmonks, went through the garden and summoned all them who had newly chosen\r\nto take refuge in the teachings. They were to put on their yellow robes\r\nand receive their first instruction in the teachings and duties of their\r\nnew status. Govinda ran to Siddhartha, embraced his childhood friend on\r\nmore time, and went to join the ranks of the novices.\r\n\r\nSiddhartha, however, wandered among the trees, deep in thought.\r\n\r\nWhile he was there he came across Gotama, the noble one. Siddhartha\r\ngreeted him with veneration. There was so much peace and goodness to be\r\nseen in the buddha’s eyes that the young man took courage and asked the\r\nvenerable one’s permission to speak to him. The noble one gave his\r\nassent with a silent nod.\r\n\r\nSiddhartha said, “Noble one, I was yesterday privileged to hear your\r\nwonderful teachings. I had come here from afar with a friend to hear them.\r\nMy friend now will stay among your followers and take refuge with you. I,\r\nhowever, will start my pilgrimage anew.”\r\n\r\n“You are free to do as you wish,” said the noble one politely.\r\n\r\n“In speaking to you I have been more bold than I should have been,”\r\nSiddhartha continued, “but I would not want to depart from the noble one\r\nwithout having given him my sincere thoughts. Would the noble one be\r\nwilling to give me another moment of his time to hear me?”\r\n\r\nThe buddha gave his assent with a silent nod.\r\n\r\nSiddhartha said, “There is something, most venerable one, that I admired\r\nmost of all in what you said. Everything in your teachings is perfectly\r\nclear and supported with proof; you depict the world as a perfect chain,\r\nnever broken anywhere on its length, an eternal chain made up of causes\r\nand effects. This has never been made so clear, never set out so\r\nirrefutably; the heart of every brahman must surely beat at a higher level\r\nwhen he has heard your teachings and first sees the world of perfect\r\ncoherence, without omissions, as clear as crystal, not dependent on\r\nchance, not dependent on any gods. This could be good or bad, could bring\r\njoy or sorrow to life, but it is not something we need to consider, it\r\ncould well be that it is not of basic importance - but the unity of the\r\nworld, that all events are inter-related, the flow of existence that\r\nembraces all things great and small, the law of cause and effect,\r\nexistence and death, all these things shine brightly out from your noble\r\nteachings, o perfect one. But there is a place in your own teachings where\r\nthis cohesion, this sound argument that governs all things is interrupted,\r\nthere is a small hole where something strange, something new, something\r\nnot previously there flows into this world, it is something that cannot be\r\nshown, cannot be proved: this is your teaching about not being overcome by\r\nthe world, your teaching about liberation. With this tiny hole, with this\r\ntiny intrusion the entire coherent and eternal world-order is once again\r\nbroken down and cannot be maintained. I hope you will forgive me for\r\nvoicing this objection.”\r\n\r\nGotama had listened to him still and unmoving. Now, with his benevolent\r\nvoice, with his clear and polite voice, the perfect one spoke: “You have\r\nlistened to the teachings, brahmin’s son, and it is good that you have\r\nthought so deeply about them. You have found a gap in them, a mistake. I\r\nhope you will continue to think about the teachings, you have a thirst for\r\nknowledge, but you should be warned of the thickets of beliefs and of\r\nquibbles around words. Beliefs are not important, they can be beautiful or\r\nugly, clever or foolish, anyone can stay attached to them or throw them\r\naway. But the teachings that you heard from me are not beliefs and I was\r\nnot trying to explain the world to them who have a thirst for knowledge. I\r\nwas attempting something quite different, I was attempting to show how to\r\ngain liberation from suffering. This is what Gotama teaches, nothing\r\nelse.”\r\n\r\n“I hope you will not be cross with me, noble one,” the young man said.\r\n“I have no wish to argue with you but to argue about words, this is why\r\nI have spoken to you in this way. You are certainly quite right, beliefs\r\nalone are not of great importance. But allow me to say one thing more: I\r\nhave never for a moment had any doubts about you. I have never for a\r\nmoment doubted that you are a buddha, that you have reached the end of\r\nyour path, the highest objective that so many thousands of brahmins and\r\nbrahmins’ sons pursue. You have found liberation from death. You have\r\nattained this by your own searching, by travelling your own path, by\r\nthought, by meditation, by knowledge, by enlightenment. You have not\r\nattained it by listening to the teachings of others! And - this is what I\r\nhave come to believe, noble one - nobody can ever attain liberation by\r\nlistening to the teachings of others! Nobody, venerable one, will come to\r\nunderstand what happened to you in the hour of your enlightenment by\r\nhearing your words and your teachings! The enlightened one, the buddha,\r\nteaches many things about how to live a good and honest life and how to\r\navoid evil, but the teaching that is so clear, that is so noble, is not\r\nthere: the noble one does not give teaching about the secret that he alone\r\nhas experienced, he alone out of hundreds of thousands. This is what I\r\nthought, what I perceived, when I heard your teachings. This is the reason\r\nI will continue in my wanderings - not to find other teachings which may\r\nbe better, for I know there are none, but to abandon all teachings and all\r\nteachers and either to attain my goal alone or to die. But, noble one, I\r\nwill often think back to this day and this hour, for my eyes have seen a\r\nman of great holiness.”\r\n\r\nThe buddha looked quietly down at the ground, the buddha’s face,\r\npeaceful but inscrutable, shone with perfect serenity.\r\n\r\n“I hope your thoughts,” the venerable one said slowly, “are not\r\nmistaken! May you arrive at your objective! But tell me: have you seen how\r\nmany samanas I have, how many brothers who have taken refuge in my\r\nteachings? And do you think, samana from a foreign place, do you think all\r\nof these would be better off if they abandoned the teachings and went back\r\nto life in the world with all its enjoyments?”\r\n\r\n“Such a thought is far from me,” Siddhartha exclaimed. “I hope they\r\nwill all remain with the teachings, I hope they will reach their goal! It\r\nis not up to me to judge how others lead their lives. I can only judge my\r\nown life, I must choose for myself, must reject for myself. We samanas\r\nseek liberation from our selves, noble one. I fear, venerable one, that if\r\nI were one of your followers I might only seem to bring my self to peace,\r\nthat my liberation would be illusory and my self would in fact continue to\r\nexist and grow bigger, as then I would have the teachings, would have my\r\nfollowers, would have my love for you, would have the community of monks\r\nand all this I would have made into my self!”\r\n\r\nWith a half-smile, with unshakeable clarity and friendliness, Gotama\r\nlooked the stranger in the eye and took his leave of him with barely\r\nnoticeable gesture.\r\n\r\n“You are clever, samana,” the venerable one said. “Your arguments,\r\nmy friend, are very clever. Take care that you do not become too\r\nclever!”\r\n\r\nThe buddha walked slowly away, and his look and his half smile remained\r\nforever engraved in Siddhartha’s memory.\r\n\r\nI have never before seen anyone look and smile, sit and walk, like this\r\nman, he thought to himself. I truly hope that I, too, will be able to look\r\nand to smile, to sit and to walk as he does, so free, so venerable, so\r\nhidden, so open, so child-like and private. It is only the man who has\r\npenetrated to his innermost self who is truly able to look and to walk in\r\nthis way. I, too, will do my utmost to penetrate to my innermost self.\r\n\r\nI have seen one man, Siddhartha thought, just one, to whom I had to lower\r\nmy eyes. I will not lower my eyes to any other man, not anyone. I will not\r\nbe drawn into any teachings, as I was not drawn into the teachings of this\r\nman.\r\n\r\nI was robbed by this buddha, Siddhartha thought, he robbed me, but he gave\r\nme much more. He robbed me of my friend, of him who had faith in me and\r\nnow has faith in him, of him who was my shadow and is now the shadow of\r\nGotama. But he made the gift to me, to Siddhartha, of myself.\r\n\r\n\r\nAWAKENING\r\n\r\nAs Siddhartha left the grove where the buddha, the perfect one, remained\r\nbehind, where Govinda remained behind, he felt that he was also leaving\r\nbehind his life so far, that it was separating itself from him. This\r\nsensation filled him completely, and he thought about it as he slowly\r\nwalked on. He pondered deeply as if sinking through deep water, he allowed\r\nhimself to drop to the bottom of this feeling to the place where its\r\ncauses lay, as it seemed to him that identifying causes was to think, and\r\nthat is the only way to make sensations into knowledge and avoid losing\r\nthem altogether, the only way to make them substantial, the only way to\r\nmake them shine and show what they contain.\r\n\r\nHe pondered as he walked slowly on. He concluded that he was no longer a\r\nyouth but had become a man. He concluded that something had left him like\r\na snake that sloughs its skin, that something within him was no longer\r\nthere for him, something that had been with him all through his youth and\r\nhad belonged to him: the wish to have a teacher and to hear teachings. He\r\nhad even departed from last teacher who had come to him on his way, the\r\nhighest and wisest of teachers, the holiest of them all, the buddha, he\r\nhad had to separate himself from him, he had been unable to accept his\r\nteachings.\r\n\r\nSiddhartha continued to ponder as he walked, and his movement became\r\nslower as he asked himself: But what was it that you wanted to learn from\r\nthe teachers? What was it that those teachers who spent so much time\r\ngiving you their lessons were nonetheless unable to teach you? And\r\nSiddhartha found an answer: What I wanted to learn was my self, I wanted\r\nto learn the meaning and the essence of my self. I wanted to be rid of my\r\nself, wanted to overcome my self. But I was not able to overcome it, was\r\nable only to cheat it, was able only to flee from it, to hide from it.\r\nThere is truly nothing in the world that has occupied my thoughts as much\r\nas this self of mine, this puzzle that I am alive, that I am separate from\r\none and all, severed from them, that I am Siddhartha! And there is nothing\r\nin the world that I know less about than myself, about Siddhartha!\r\n\r\nSiddhartha walked more slowly as he pondered and then, gripped by these\r\nthoughts, came to a stop. And at that moment a new thought sprang out from\r\nthem: There is a reason why I know nothing about myself, a cause for\r\nSiddhartha remaining so strange and unfamiliar to me, just one cause; I\r\nwas in fear of myself, I was in flight from myself! I sought Atman, I\r\nsought Brahman, I had resolved to break my self apart, to flay it apart so\r\nthat in its innermost, least known part I could find the kernel within all\r\nshells, Atman, life, the divine, the ultimate. But in the process I lost\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nSiddhartha suddenly opened his eyes and looked around him, a smile covered\r\nhis face, and a profound sense of waking from a long period of dreams\r\nflowed through him all the way down to his toes. And as soon as he began\r\nto walk on he walked quickly, like a man who knows what he has to do.\r\n\r\nHe took in a deep breath and thought to himself: “I will not let\r\nSiddhartha get away from me now! I will no longer let my thoughts and my\r\nlife begin with Atman and the suffering of the world. I will no longer\r\nkill myself and dismember myself in order to see behind the ruins and find\r\na secret there. I will no longer take teachings from yoga-veda, nor from\r\natharva-veda, nor the ascetics nor any other kind of teaching. I will\r\nlearn by myself alone, be a student of myself, learn to know myself, the\r\nsecret of Siddhartha.”\r\n\r\nHe looked around him as if seeing the world for the first time. The world\r\nwas beautiful, filled with many colours, strange and puzzling was the\r\nworld! Blue here, yellow here, green here, sky and river flowed, trees and\r\nhills reached upwards, everything beautiful, everything puzzling and\r\nmagic, and in the middle of it all was he, Siddhartha, the awakening one,\r\non the way to himself. All this, all this yellow and blue, river and wood,\r\nentered into Siddhartha through his eyes for the first time, it was no\r\nlonger the sorcery of Mara, no longer the veil of maya, no longer the\r\nmeaningless and random diversity of the world of delusion that the deep\r\nthinking brahmin despises, that the deep thinking brahmin scorns in his\r\nsearch for unity. Blue was blue, river was river, this was where the\r\ndivine lived hidden, the blueness and the river lay within Siddhartha but\r\nthis was how the divine showed itself and it was nonetheless one; yellow\r\nhere, blue here, the sky there, the woods there, and here to be\r\nSiddhartha. Meaning and essence were not somewhere behind things, they\r\nwere within them, in everything.\r\n\r\n“I have been so deaf, so dull-witted!” he thought as he hurried\r\nforward. “When a man reads scripture in pursuit of its meaning he does\r\nnot despise the ciphers and letters, calling them deceitful, random or\r\nmeaningless shells, he reads it, he studies it and loves it, letter by\r\nletter. But I, who wanted to read the book of the world and the book of my\r\nown essence, I did despise the ciphers and letters for the sake of a\r\nmeaning I thought I knew beforehand, when I saw the world, when I touched\r\nthe world, I called it delusion, I called my eye and my tongue random and\r\nworthless appearances. No, this is in the past now, I have awoken, I have\r\ntruly awoken and today I am born for the first time.”\r\n\r\nAs Siddhartha had this thought he suddenly stopped walking again, as if\r\nthere lay a snake in front of him on the path, he also awoke to this\r\ninsight: I am not now that which I once was, I am no longer an ascetic, I\r\nam no longer a priest, I am no longer a brahmin. So what should I do at\r\nhome in the house of my father? Study? Perform sacrifices? Cultivate\r\nmeditation? All this lies now in the past, all this is no longer on my\r\npath.\r\n\r\nFor suddenly there was something else that had become clear to him: He,\r\nwho had in fact become like one awoken or newly born, he would have to\r\nstart his life anew and from its very beginning. That very morning, as he\r\nleft the grove of Jetavana, the grove of the noble one, already awaking,\r\nalready on the way to himself, it was his intention, an intention that\r\nseemed to be natural and a matter of course, that he would bring his years\r\nof living as an ascetic to an end and return home to his father. But now,\r\nonly now at this moment when he stopped walking as if a snake lay on the\r\npath in front of him, he awoke also to this insight: I am no longer the\r\nperson I once was, I am no longer an ascetic, I am no longer a priest, I\r\nam no longer a brahmin. So what should I do if I go back home to my\r\nfather? Study? Perform sacrifices? Cultivate meditation? These things are\r\nall in the past, these things no longer lie before me on my way.\r\n\r\nSiddhartha stood there motionless, and for one moment, for one intake of\r\nbreath, his heart remained frozen, he felt it freezing in his breast\r\ninside him like a small animal, a bird or a hare, as he saw how alone he\r\nwas. For many years he had been without a home and had not felt it. Now he\r\ndid feel it. Until now, even when immersed in the deepest meditation, he\r\nhad been his father’s son, a brahmin, a man of high status, a spiritual\r\nman. Now he was merely Siddhartha, the awoken one, nothing more. He drew\r\nin a deep breath, and for a moment he froze and shuddered. No-one was as\r\nalone as he was. No nobleman who did not belong among noblemen, no\r\nhandworker who did not belong among handworkers but found refuge among\r\nthem, sharing his life with theirs and speaking their language. No brahmin\r\nwho did not count as a brahmin and lived among them, no ascetic who found\r\nno refuge in his status as a samana, and not even the hermit lost deepest\r\nin the woods was single or alone, even he was surrounded by the things he\r\nbelonged to, even he belonged to a certain condition that made that place\r\nhis home. Govinda had become a monk and had a thousand monks as his\r\nbrothers, he wore his robes, believed his beliefs and spoke his language.\r\nBut he, Siddhartha, where did he belong? Whose life would he share? Whose\r\nlanguage would he speak?\r\n\r\nFrom this moment on, when the world around him was melting away, when he\r\nstood alone like a star in the sky, from this moment of coldness and\r\ndespair, Siddhartha always rose up more his self than he had been, more\r\nconcentrated than he had been. He felt: This was the final spasm of\r\nawakening, the last cramp of his birth. And he immediately stepped out\r\nagain, began to walk quickly and impatiently, no longer going home, no\r\nlonger going to his father, no longer going back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART TWO\r\n\r\nDedicated to Wilhem Gundert, my cousin in Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\nKAMALA\r\n\r\nAs Siddhartha went on his way the world was transformed and his heart was\r\nenchanted, and with every step he learnt something new. He saw the sun\r\nrise above the trees on the mountains and saw it set behind distant palmy\r\nbeaches. At night he saw the stars ranged across the sky and the crescent\r\nmoon like a boat swimming in a sea of blue. He saw trees, stars, animals,\r\nclouds, rainbows, crags, herbs, flowers, streams and rivers as they\r\nflowed, morning dew that glistened in the bushes, lofty mountains blue and\r\npale in the distance, birds and bees both gave their song, the wind blew,\r\nsoughing in the silver fields of rice. All of this, bright with colour\r\neverywhere, had always been there, the sun and moon had always shone,\r\nrivers rushed and bees did buzz, but for Siddhartha until then all of this\r\nhad been nothing but a fleeting and delusory veil before his eyes,\r\nsomething to be mistrusted, something to be pierced and destroyed by the\r\nintellect, for it was something that did not exist, for existence lay\r\nbeyond that which could be seen. But now his eye was free, it lingered on\r\nthis side of what could be seen, it looked and it acknowledged what could\r\nbe seen, it sought its home in this world, no longer sought the essence,\r\ndid not strive for the beyond. Seen in this way, without searching, so\r\nsimple, so child-like, the world was beautiful. The moon and stars were\r\nbeautiful, rivers and shores were beautiful, woods and crags, goats and\r\nbeetles, flowers and butterflies. Beautiful and lovely it was, so to go\r\nthrough the world, so child-like, so awake, so open to the things around\r\nhim, so without mistrust. The sun burnt on his head differently, the shade\r\nof the woods cooled him differently, the streams and ponds tasted\r\ndifferently, marrow and banana tasted differently. The days were short,\r\nthe nights were short, every hour flew swift away like a sailboat on the\r\nwater, the sailboat full of treasure, full of joy. Siddhartha saw a troop\r\nof monkeys travelling in the branches of the forest canopy, he heard their\r\nwild and greedy song. Siddhartha saw a ram pursue the ewe and mating with\r\nher. In a lake of reeds he saw the pike pursue his prey to still his\r\nevening hunger, the school of young fish who, in fear, rushed anxiously,\r\nflapping and flashing above the water, strength and passion forced their\r\nscent from the rapid-swirling water, from the fierce tumult worked up by\r\ntheir pursuer.\r\n\r\nAll these things had always been, and he had not seen them; he had not\r\nbeen with them. Now he was with them, he belonged to them. Light and shade\r\nran through his eyes, through his heart ran star and moon.\r\n\r\nOn his way Siddhartha also thought about all the things he had experienced\r\nin the garden of Jetavana, the teachings he had heard there, the divine\r\nbuddha, the farewell from Govinda, his conversation with the noble one. He\r\nthought again about the words that he had himself said to the noble one,\r\nremembered every word, and was astonished to suddenly realise that he had\r\nsaid things he had not known till then. What he had said to Gotama: his\r\nown, the buddha’s, treasures and secrets, these were not the teachings,\r\nthe ineffable was the teaching, something that could not be taught, what\r\nhe experienced at the moment of his enlightenment - yes, this was the\r\nthing that he was now striving for, what he was only now beginning to\r\nexperience. The thing that he had to experience now for himself. He had\r\nprobably long known that he was his own Atman, the same eternal essence as\r\nBrahman. But it was something he had never really found for himself\r\nbecause he had tried to capture it with the web of thought. The body too,\r\ncould certainly not be the thing he sought, nor playing games with\r\nthinking, not thought, not understanding, not the wisdom that has been\r\nlearned, not the art that has been learned that allows you to draw\r\nconclusions and spin new thoughts from the ones already spun. No, even\r\nthis world of thoughts was still on this side and it led nowhere to kill\r\nthe random self of the senses, only to cram the random self full of\r\nthoughts and doctrines. Both of them, thoughts and senses, were very\r\nbeautiful but both of them hid the ultimate sense, both of them were worth\r\nlistening to, worth playing with, neither should be either despised or\r\nover-valued, both of them offered to let you hear the secret voice of the\r\ninnermost. There was nothing he strove for other than what the voice told\r\nhim to strive for, nothing he would dwell on other than where the voice\r\ntold him to dwell. Why had Gotama sat under the bo tree at that moment of\r\nmoments where enlightenment came upon him? He had heard a voice, a voice\r\nin his own heart which told him to seek rest under this tree, he had not\r\nchosen rather to mortify his flesh, to perform sacrifice, ablution nor\r\nprayer, he had not sought food nor drink nor sleep nor dreams, he had done\r\nas the voice told him. This obedience was the one thing needed, not any\r\ncommand from outside himself, just the voice, to be ready, that was good,\r\nthat was needed, nothing else was needed.\r\n\r\nIn the night, while he slept by the river in the ferry man’s straw hut,\r\nSiddhartha had a dream: Govinda stood before him in the yellow robes of\r\nthe ascetic. Govinda looked sad, and sadly he asked, “Why have you\r\nabandoned me?” At this Siddhartha embraced Govinda, threw his arms\r\naround him, and as he drew him to his breast and kissed him it was Govinda\r\nno longer, it was a woman, and from the woman’s robe welled out her full\r\nbreast at which Siddhartha put his mouth and drank, sweet and strong was\r\nthe taste of the milk from this breast. It tasted of woman and man, of\r\nsunshine and forest, of beast and flower, of every fruit, of every joy. It\r\nmade him drunk and unaware of himself. When Siddhartha woke, the pale\r\nriver shimmered with light that came in through the door of the hut, and\r\nfrom the forest came the deep, dark, distinct call of an owl.\r\n\r\nAt the start of day Siddhartha asked his host, the ferry man, to take him\r\nacross the river. The ferry man put him on his bamboo raft and took him\r\nacross the river as the red light of morning shimmered on the expanse of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n“This is a beautiful river,” he said to his companion.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the ferry man, “it is a very beautiful river, I love it\r\nabove all else. I have many times listened to what it has to say, many\r\ntimes looked into its eyes, and it has always had something to teach me.\r\nThere is a great deal that you can learn from a river.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you for your help,” said Siddhartha as he stepped onto the\r\nother shore. “I have nothing I could give you for your hospitality, my\r\nfriend, nothing I could pay you. I have no home to live in, I am the son\r\nof a brahmin and a samana.”\r\n\r\n“That was easy to see,” said the ferry man, “and I never did expect\r\nany payment from you, no gift for my hospitality. You can give me\r\nsomething another time.”\r\n\r\n“You think so?” said Siddhartha with a laugh.\r\n\r\n“Certainly. That too is something I have learnt from the river:\r\neverything comes back again! Even you, samana, you will be back again. So,\r\nfarewell! My fee can be your friendship. Think of me always when you make\r\nsacrifice to the gods.”\r\n\r\nSmiling, they took their leave of each other. Smiling, Siddhartha was glad\r\nof the friendship and the friendliness of the ferry man. “He is so like\r\nGovinda,” he smiling thought, “everyone I come across on my ways is\r\nlike Govinda. Everyone gives me thanks, although it is they who have the\r\nright to receive thanks from me. Everyone is humble, everyone wishes to be\r\nmy friend, everyone wishes to obey me and to think little. People are like\r\nchildren.”\r\n\r\nAround midday he was walking through a village. In the street and in front\r\nof its mud huts there were children running about, playing with marrow\r\nseeds and mussels, they shouted and played rough games with each other,\r\nbut when this strange samana appeared they became timid and ran away. As\r\nit left the village the path led across a stream and there was a young\r\nwoman kneeling at the bank of the stream washing clothes. As Siddhartha\r\ngreeted her she raised her head and looked up at him with a smile so that\r\nhe could see the sparkling whiteness of her eyes. He declared a blessing\r\non her, as is usual among travellers, and asked her how far it still was\r\ntill he would reach the big city. At that, she stood up and went up to\r\nhim, her face looked young and the light sparkled appealingly on her moist\r\nlips. She exchanged a few jokey words with him, asked if he was hungry,\r\nand whether it was true that samanas sleep alone in the woods and are not\r\nallowed to have any women with them. As she said this she placed her left\r\nfoot on his right foot and made the kind of movement a woman makes when\r\nshe is leading a man into that sort of amorous pleasure which the books\r\ncall “climbing a tree.” Siddhartha felt his blood become warm, and as\r\nhis dream came back into his mind at that moment he leant down slightly\r\ntowards the woman and, with his lips, he kissed the brown tip of her\r\nbreast. When he looked up he saw the smile on her face, full of desire,\r\nand that her narrowed eyes yearned for him.\r\n\r\nSiddhartha also felt desire and felt the source of his gender as it began\r\nto move; but he had never touched a woman until then and he hesitated a\r\nmoment before his hands were ready to reach out for her. And in that\r\nmoment he shivered as he heard a voice from deep within him, and the voice\r\nsaid no. Then all the charm faded from the young woman’s smiling face,\r\nall he saw was the damp gaze of a woman impelled by lust like an animal.\r\nHe remained friendly, stroked her cheek, turned away from her and\r\ndisappeared nimbly into the bamboo forest, leaving her disappointed.\r\n\r\nBefore the day had passed into evening, Siddhartha reached a big city, and\r\nhe looked forward to having human company. He had lived long in the\r\nforests, the straw hut of the ferry man where he had slept the previous\r\nnight was the first time he had slept under any roof for a long time.\r\n\r\nBefore he entered the town, near a pleasant wood enclosed within a fence,\r\nthe wanderer met with a group of servants laden with baskets. In the\r\nmiddle of them was their mistress on a decorated palanquin borne by four\r\nmen, she was seated on red cushions and protected from the sun under a\r\nbrightly coloured roof. Siddhartha remained at the entrance to the wooded\r\npleasure garden and watched the procession as it passed, saw the servants,\r\nthe maids, the baskets, the palanquin, and on the palanquin saw the lady.\r\nUnder a high tower of black hair he saw a face that was very fair, very\r\ntender and very wise, he saw a mouth that was pink like a freshly opened\r\nfig, eyebrows that were carefully tended and painted into tall arches,\r\neyes that were intelligent and dark, a tall, a fair neck that rose up from\r\nthe green and golden clothing around it, fair hands that lay at rest, long\r\nand slender with wide gold rings over the joints.\r\n\r\nSiddhartha saw how beautiful she was, and his heart laughed. He bowed\r\ndeeply as the palanquin came near, and as he righted himself he looked\r\ninto that fair and noble face, into the intelligent eyes with their arched\r\nbrows, he breathed in a fragrance he did not know. The beautiful woman\r\nsmiled and briefly nodded to him before she disappeared into the wood,\r\nfollowed by her servers.\r\n\r\nThat is a good portent for the city I am now entering, thought Siddhartha.\r\nHe felt the urge to go into the wood but then thought better of it, and\r\nonly then did he become aware of how the servers and maids at the entrance\r\nhad looked at him, with what contempt, with what mistrust, with what\r\ndismissal.\r\n\r\nI am still a samana, he thought, still an ascetic and a beggar. I will\r\nnot, as such, be allowed to stay, not be allowed into the wood. And he\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he met someone on the road he asked about the wood and what the\r\nname of that woman was. He learned that it was the grove of Kamala, the\r\nfamous courtesan, and that she owned a house in the city as well as the\r\nwood.\r\n\r\nSiddhartha then made his way into the city. Now he knew where he should\r\ngo.\r\n\r\nIn order to arrive there he allowed the city to drink him in, followed the\r\ncrowds in the streets, stood still in the city squares, rested on the\r\nstone steps beside the river. As evening fell he made friends with a\r\nbarber’s assistant whom he had seen at work in the shade of a dome. He\r\ncame across him later that day as he prayed in a temple of Vishnu, and\r\ntold him the stories about Vishnu and Lakshmi. He slept that night among\r\nthe boats on the river and then, early in the morning, before the first\r\ncustomers arrived in his shop, he had the barber’s assistant shave him,\r\ncut his hair, comb his hair and dress it with fine oil. Then he went down\r\nto bathe in the river.\r\n\r\nLate that afternoon when the beautiful Kamala was approaching her grove on\r\nher palanquin she found Siddhartha waiting at the entrance. He bowed to\r\nher and accepted her greeting to him. When the train of servants had\r\nnearly passed him he caught the attention of the last of them and asked\r\nhim to inform his mistress that there was a young brahmin who wished to\r\nspeak with her. Siddhartha waited, after a while the servant came back,\r\ninvited him to follow him, led him in silence into a pavilion where Kamala\r\nlay on a couch and left him alone with her.\r\n\r\n“Was it not you who stood outside there yesterday and offered me\r\ngreeting? Kamala asked.\r\n\r\n“Indeed, I did see you yesterday and offer you greeting.”\r\n\r\n“But did you not have a beard yesterday, and long hair and dust in your\r\nhair?”\r\n\r\n“You observed well, you saw everything. You saw Siddhartha, the\r\nbrahmin’s son who left his home to become a samana and spent three years\r\nas a samana. Now, though, I have left that path and come to this city, and\r\nyou were the first to greet me her, even before I had set foot in it. I\r\ncan say that it is to you that I have come, o Kamala! You are the first\r\nwoman with whom Siddhartha has spoken without his eyes lowered. I will\r\nnever again lower my eyes when I meet with a beautiful woman.”\r\n\r\nKamala smiled and played with her fan of peacock feathers. And she asked,\r\n“And has Siddhartha come to me just to say this?”\r\n\r\n“To say this and to give you my thanks for your beauty. And if it will\r\nnot displease you, Kamala, I should like to ask you to be my friend and my\r\nteacher, for I still know nothing of the arts in which you are so\r\nexpert.”\r\n\r\nAt this Kamala laughed out loud.\r\n\r\n“This has never happened to me before, my friend, a samana comes to me\r\nout of the woods and wants to learn from me! It has never happened to me\r\nthat a long-haired samana in a ragged loin cloth has come to me! There are\r\nmany young men who do come to me, some of them are even the sons of\r\nbrahmins, but they come wearing beautiful clothes and expensive shoes,\r\nthey have perfumed hair and a purse full of money. That is what the young\r\nmen look like who come to me, samana.”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha said, “I am only beginning to learn from you. But I already\r\nlearned from you yesterday. I have had my beard nicely removed, I have\r\ncombed my hair and have oil in it. The things I lack are the things least\r\nimportant, most excellent lady: fine clothes, fine shoes, money in a\r\npurse. Do be aware that Siddhartha has undertaken much harder tasks than\r\ntrifles like that, and has achieved them. Why should I not now achieve the\r\ntask I undertook yesterday? To be your friend and to learn the pleasures\r\nof love from you! You will see what a good student I am, Kamala, I have\r\nlearned many thing that are harder than what you have to teach me. Do you\r\nsay, then, that Siddhartha is not good enough for you as he is, with oil\r\nin his hair but without clothes, without shoes, without money?”\r\n\r\nKamala laughed out loud and said, “No, worthy young man, he is not good\r\nenough! Not yet! He must have clothes, beautiful clothes, shoes must he\r\nhave, fine shoes, he must have plentiful money in his purse, and he must\r\nbring presents for Kamala. Do you understand now, samana from the woods?\r\nDo you see?”\r\n\r\n“I see it well,” Siddhartha exclaimed. “How could I have failed to\r\nsee what has just come from a mouth such as this? Your mouth is like a fig\r\nfreshly broken open, Kamala. My mouth, too, is red and fresh, it will suit\r\nyour mouth well, you will see. But, beautiful Kamala, are you not at all\r\nafraid of this samana from the woods who has come to you to learn the arts\r\nof love?”\r\n\r\n“Why should I be afraid of a samana, a stupid samana, come from the\r\nwoods where the jackals live and who still has no idea of what women\r\nare?”\r\n\r\n“The samana is strong, though. He fears nothing. He would be able to\r\nforce you, handsome girl. He could rob you. He could hurt you.”\r\n\r\n“No, samana, I’m not afraid of that. Has a samana or a brahmin ever\r\nbeen afraid that someone might come and attack him and rob him of his\r\nlearning, his piety or his deep understanding? No, for those things belong\r\nto him alone, and he gives them to others only when he wants to give and\r\nto whom he wants to give. It is just the same for Kamala and the joys of\r\nlove. Kamala’s mouth is red and lovely, but if you try to kiss it\r\nagainst Kamala’s will you will have not a drop of sweetness from it,\r\neven though it knows how to give so much sweetness. Siddhartha, you want\r\nto learn, so here is something for you to learn: You can beg for love, buy\r\nlove, receive love as a gift, you can find it on the street, but you\r\ncannot steal love. This way that you have invented for yourself is wrong.\r\nNo, and it would be such a pity if a charming young man such as yourself\r\ngrabbed for it in a way that is so mistaken.”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha smiled and bowed to her. “Yes, Kamala, you are quite right!\r\nIt would be a pity. It would be an awful pity. No, I do not want any drop\r\nof sweetness from your mouth to be wasted on me, nor any drop of mine\r\nwasted on you! Only one option remains for us. Siddhartha must come back\r\nwhen he has the things that, at present, are lacking: clothes, shoes,\r\nmoney. But, noble Kamala, tell me, can you not give me just one more piece\r\nof advice?”\r\n\r\n“A piece of advice Why not? Who would not be happy to give a piece of\r\nadvice to a poor and innocent samana, just come down from the woods where\r\nthe jackals live?”\r\n\r\n“So tell me, dear Kamala, tell me where I should go so that I can obtain\r\nthese three things as quickly as possible?”\r\n\r\n“There are many who would like to know that, my friend. You will have to\r\ndo what you have learnt to do, and take money for it, and clothes, and\r\nshoes. There is no other way for a poor man to obtain money. What can you\r\ndo then?”\r\n\r\n“I can think. I can wait. I can fast.”\r\n\r\n“Is that all?”\r\n\r\n“That is all. Wait, I can write poetry too. Will you give me a kiss in\r\nexchange for a poem?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I will give you a kiss, if I like the poem. What is the title of\r\nthis poem then?”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha thought about it for a moment, and then he spoke these verses:\r\n\r\n  The shadowy grove where went the lovely Kamala,\r\n  The entrance there, where stood the brown-skin’d samana,\r\n  There bowed he deep, he saw the lotus flower,\r\n  And Kamala thanked him with smiles and graciousness.\r\n  ‘Tis lovely, thought he, to offer praise to gods,\r\n  ‘Tis lovelier still to sacrifice all for her.\r\n  The lovely Kamala clapped her bangled hands.\r\n\r\n“Your verses are lovely, brown samana, and indeed I have nothing to lose\r\nif I let you have a kiss for them.”\r\n\r\nWith a gesture of her eyes she drew him to herself, he leant his face to\r\nhers and put his mouth on her mouth, which was like a fig newly broken\r\nopen. Kamala’s kiss was long, and Siddhartha felt deep astonishment at\r\nhow she taught him, at how wise she was, at how she mastered him, pushed\r\nhim away and drew him back, and at how this first kiss would be followed\r\nby many more, a long, well ordered, well-tested series of kisses, each of\r\nthem different from the last, that awaited him. He remained standing,\r\nbreathing deeply, and at that moment he was amazed at the fullness of\r\nknowledge, the fullness of things worth knowing, that promised themselves\r\nto him in front of his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Your verses are lovely,” Kamala declared, “if I were rich I would\r\ngive you a piece of gold for them. Though you will find it very hard to\r\ngather as much money as you need by making up verses. You will, after all,\r\nneed such a lot of money if you want to be the friend of Kamala.”\r\n\r\n“Th..the way you kiss, Kamala!” Siddhartha stammered.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I am good at that, aren’t I. That is why I am never short of\r\nclothes and shoes and jewelry and all those nice things. But what will\r\nbecome of you? Can you think of nothing else but thinking and fasting and\r\nmaking up verses?”\r\n\r\n“I know the songs for performing sacrifice, too,” said Siddhartha,\r\n“though I no longer wish to sing them. I know magic spells, too, though\r\nI no longer wish to cast them. I have read the scriptures ...”\r\n\r\n“Stop,” Kamala interrupted him. “You can read? And write?”\r\n\r\n“Of course I can. There are many who can.”\r\n\r\n“Most people cannot. Even I cannot. It is very good that you can read\r\nand write, very good. You will even be able to put the magic spells to\r\ngood use.”\r\n\r\nAt that moment a servant girl came running and whispered something into\r\nher mistress’s ear.\r\n\r\n“I have a visitor,” Kamala declared. You must go Siddhartha, quickly,\r\nyou need to be aware that no-one should ever see you here! I will see you\r\nagain tomorrow.”\r\n\r\nBut she ordered the maid to give the pious brahmin a white shirt. Before\r\nhe knew what was happening to him the maid had led Siddhartha away through\r\nindirect paths to a summerhouse, given him the shirt, drawn him into the\r\nundergrowth and emphasised to him that he should leave the grove as\r\nquickly as possible and without being seen by anyone.\r\n\r\nHe was content to do as he had been told. He was used to the woods and\r\nmade his way out of the grove and over the hedge without a sound. He was\r\ncontent to make his way back into the town, the shirt, rolled into a\r\nbundle, under his arm. He went to the door of a travellers’ hostel and\r\nasked silently for food, and silently accepted a piece of rice cake. This\r\nis probably the last day, he thought, when I will ever beg for food.\r\n\r\nPride suddenly flamed up in him. He was no longer a samana, it was no\r\nlonger appropriate for him to beg. He gave the rice cake to a dog and,\r\nhimself, went without food.\r\n\r\n“Life here in the world is simple,” Siddhartha thought. “There are\r\nno difficulties. When I was still a samana everything was difficult, it\r\ntook much effort and, in the end, it was without hope. Everything is easy\r\nnow, the lesson in kissing that Kamala gave me was easy. I need clothes\r\nand money, that is all, and aims like that are petty and close at hand,\r\nno-one would lose any sleep about them.”\r\n\r\nHe had long since discovered where Kamala’s house in the city was, and\r\nthe following day he arrived at its door.\r\n\r\n“It is going well,” she called out to him. “You are expected by\r\nKamaswami, and he is the richest businessman in the city. If he likes you\r\nhe will take you into his service, so do be clever, won’t you, brown\r\nsamana. I have had others tell him all about you. Be friendly to him, he\r\nis very powerful. But do not be too modest about yourself! I do not want\r\nyou to be just one of his servants, you will have to be his equal, or else\r\nI will not be happy with you. Kamaswami is getting old, he is becoming\r\ncomplacent. If he likes you he will place a lot of trust in you.”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha thanked her and laughed, and when he told her he had eaten\r\nnothing that day or the previous day she had bread and fruit brought for\r\nhim to eat.\r\n\r\n“You have been lucky,” she told him as he left, “one door after\r\nanother is opening up for you. How could that be possible? Are you\r\nperforming magic?”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha said, “Yesterday I told you I know how to think, to wait, and\r\nto fast, but you thought that would be of no use. But it is very useful,\r\nKamala, you will see. You will see that the stupid samanas in the wood\r\nlearn to know and to do many nice things that you do not know how to do.\r\nTwo days ago I was just a ragged beggar, one day ago I had already kissed\r\nKamala, and soon I will be a businessman with money and with all the\r\nthings that you think are important.”\r\n\r\n“I expect you will,” she conceded. “But where would you be without\r\nme? What would become of you if Kamala did not help you?”\r\n\r\n“Dear Kamala,” said Siddhartha, standing up straight, “when I came\r\nto you in your grove it was I who made the first step. I was resolved to\r\nlearn the art of love from this most beautiful of women. From the very\r\nmoment when I formed this resolution I also knew that I would succeed in\r\nit. I knew that you would help me, I knew it from the moment I first\r\nglimpsed you at the entrance to the grove.”\r\n\r\n“What if I had not wanted to?”\r\n\r\n“You did want to. Kamala, listen: if you throw a stone into water it\r\ndrops quickly to the bottom by the fastest route it can. Siddhartha does\r\nnothing, he waits, he thinks, he fasts, but he goes through the things of\r\nthe world like a stone through water without doing anything, without\r\nmaking any effort; he is drawn, he lets himself fall. His objective pulls\r\nhim to itself, for he allows nothing into his soul that might work against\r\nhis objective. That, Kamala, is what Siddhartha learnt among the samanas.\r\nThat, Kamala, is what fools call magic in the supposition that it is\r\nperformed by demons. Nothing is ever performed by demons, there are no\r\ndemons. Anyone can perform magic, anyone can attain his objectives if he\r\nis capable of thought, if he is capable of waiting, if he is capable of\r\nfasting.”\r\n\r\nKamala listened to him. She loved his voice, she loved the look in his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n“Maybe, my friend,” she said quietly, “you are right in what you\r\nsay. Maybe it is also true that Siddhartha is an attractive man, that the\r\nlook of him will appeal to women, maybe that is what brings him all his\r\nluck.”\r\n\r\nWith a kiss, Siddhartha took his leave. “I hope you are right, my\r\nteacher. I hope the look of me will always please you, I hope you will\r\nalways bring me luck!”\r\n\r\n\r\nAMONG THE CHILDLIKE PEOPLE\r\n\r\nSiddhartha went to see Kamaswami the businessman, he was shown into a\r\nhouse of opulence, servants led him past costly carpets into a chamber\r\nwhere he waited for the master of the house.\r\n\r\nKamaswami entered, a fast-moving, nimble man with very grey hair, with\r\nvery clever and cautious eyes and an acquisitive-looking mouth. Master and\r\nguest offered friendly greetings to each other.\r\n\r\n“I am told,” the businessman began, “that you are a brahmin, a man\r\nof learning, but you seek a position in the service of a businessman. Have\r\nyou fallen into need then, brahman, is that why you seek a position of\r\nservice?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Siddhartha, “I have not fallen into need and I never have\r\nhad difficulties. You should be aware that I come from the samanas, among\r\nwhom I lived for a long time.”\r\n\r\n“How can you not be in need if you have come from the samanas? Do\r\nsamanas not live completely without possessions?”\r\n\r\n“I am without possessions,” said Siddhartha, “if that is what you\r\nmean. Certainly, I am without possessions. But I am without possessions by\r\nmy own free will, so I am not in need.”\r\n\r\n“What do you think you will live on if you have no possessions?”\r\n\r\n“I have never thought about that, sir. I have been without possessions\r\nfor more than three years, and have never given a thought to what I should\r\nlive on.”\r\n\r\n“You have lived on the possessions of others then, have you?”\r\n\r\n“That is what some would say. But a businessman, too, lives on the\r\npossessions of others.”\r\n\r\n“Well said. But he does not take the possessions of others for nothing;\r\nhe gives them his goods for them.”\r\n\r\n“That does indeed seem to be their relationship. Each takes, each gives,\r\nthat is life.”\r\n\r\n“But, if I may ask: if you have no possessions what do you have to\r\ngive?”\r\n\r\n“Each gives what he has. The warrior gives strength, the businessman\r\ngives goods, the teacher gives teaching, the farmer gives rice, the\r\nfisherman gives fish.\r\n\r\n“Very well. And what is it, then, that you have to give? What is it that\r\nyou have learnt to do?”\r\n\r\n“I can think. I can wait. I can fast.”\r\n\r\n“Is that all?”\r\n\r\n“I think that is all!”\r\n\r\n“And what is the good of that? Fasting, for instance, what is the good\r\nof that?”\r\n\r\n“It is a lot of good, sir. If a man has nothing to eat then fasting is\r\nthe cleverest thing of all that he can do. If, for instance, Siddhartha\r\nhad never learnt to fast he would now have to perform some kind of\r\nservice, be it for you or anyone else, for hunger would force him into it.\r\nBut now Siddhartha can wait in peace, he knows no impatience, he knows no\r\nurgency, he can long withstand the siege of hunger and can laugh in its\r\nface. That, sir, is the good of fasting.”\r\n\r\n“You are right, samana. Wait a moment.”\r\n\r\nKamaswami went out and came back with a roll of paper which he handed to\r\nhis guest, asking, “Can you read this?”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha looked at the roll on which a business contract was written and\r\nbegan to read out what it said.\r\n\r\n“Excellent,” said Kamaswami. “And now will you write something on\r\nthis sheet for me?”\r\n\r\nHe gave him pen and paper, and Siddhartha wrote and gave the sheet of\r\npaper back.\r\n\r\nKamaswami read, “Writing is good, thinking is better. Cleverness is\r\ngood, patience is better.”\r\n\r\n“You can write very well,” the businessman praised him. We will have a\r\nlot to talk about together. For today, though, I ask you to be my guest\r\nand to take up residence in this house.”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha thanked him and accepted his offer, and now he lived in the\r\nmerchant’s house. Clothes were brought to him, and shoes, and a servant\r\nprepared his bath for him every day. Twice a day a copious meal was\r\nbrought in, but Siddhartha ate only once a day and he neither ate flesh\r\nnor drank wine. Kamaswami told him about his business, showed him his\r\ngoods and his warehouses, let him see his accounts. Siddhartha learned\r\nmany new things, he listened much and spoke little. He remembered the\r\nwords of Kamala and was never the merchant’s subordinate, he forced him\r\nto see him as his equal, even to treat him as more than his equal.\r\nKamaswami took great care over his business, often even showing passion\r\nfor it, but Siddhartha saw it all as a game. He made the effort to learn\r\nthe rules of the game, but the content of the game did not touch his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nSiddhartha had not been long in Kamaswami’s house before he took part in\r\nits owner’s business affairs. Every day, but at the time she stipulated,\r\nhe would visit the beautiful Kamala, wearing fine clothes, fine shoes, and\r\nhe soon began also to bring her presents. He learned a lot from her red\r\nand skillful mouth. He learned a lot from her gentle and supple hand. In\r\nmatters of love Siddhartha was still a child, he was inclined to throw\r\nhimself blindly and insatiably into his pleasures as if into a bottomless\r\npit, but Kamala taught him from the very basics, she taught him that you\r\ncannot receive pleasure without giving pleasure, that every gesture, every\r\nstroke, every touch, every look, every tiny part of the body has its\r\nsecret, and waking those secrets will bring happiness to whoever knows\r\nabout them. She taught him that lovers should never separate immediately\r\nafter the celebration of their love, not without each admiring the other,\r\nnot without having conquered and having been conquered, so that neither\r\nwill feel over-sated or abandoned or cross, or feel that one has misused\r\nthe other or feel to have been misused. The hours he spent with this\r\nclever and beautiful artist were a time of wonder, he became her student,\r\nher lover, her friend. The value and meaning of his life now lay here with\r\nKamala, not with the business affairs of Kamaswami.\r\n\r\nThe businessman delegated the writing of important letters and contracts\r\nto him, and formed the habit of seeking his advice on all important\r\ndecisions. He saw quickly that Siddhartha knew little about rice and wool,\r\nabout shipping and commerce, but he saw that what he did brought good\r\nluck, he saw that Siddhartha knew far more than he about peace and\r\nequanimity, about the art of listening, and saw his acumen in\r\nunderstanding strangers. “This brahmin,” he said to a friend, “is\r\nnot a proper businessman and he never will be, his soul never goes into\r\naffairs with any passion. But he has the secret of people to whom success\r\ncomes of itself. Maybe it is because he was born under a good star, maybe\r\nit is magic, and maybe it is something he learned when he lived with the\r\nsamanas. He only ever seems to be playing at business, business never\r\nseems to penetrate him, never to be his master, he never fears failure and\r\nhe is never bothered by making a loss.”\r\n\r\nThe friend advised the businessman, “Give him a third of the profit of\r\nall the business he does for you, and let him bear the same proportion of\r\nthe losses when they happen. That will make him more enthusiastic.”\r\n\r\nKamaswami followed this advice. But Siddhartha seemed little bothered by\r\nit. If he made a profit he accepted it with indifference; if he made a\r\nloss he would laugh and say, “Oh look, that did not go well!”\r\n\r\nIt did indeed seem that he was indifferent to affairs of business. One day\r\nhe went out to a village to buy up a large harvest of rice, but when he\r\narrived the rice had already been sold to another handler. Siddhartha\r\nnonetheless remained for several days in the village, making the farmers\r\nhis guests, giving copper coins to their children, attended a wedding\r\nceremony, and came back from his journey entirely happy and content.\r\nKamaswami accused him of squandering time and money by not having come\r\nstraight back. Siddhartha answered, “Do not tell me off, my friend!\r\nNothing has ever been achieved by telling anyone off. If I have caused you\r\nto make a loss just let me bear it. I am very satisfied with this journey.\r\nI met many new people, a brahmin is now my friend, children played on my\r\nknees, farmers showed me their fields, no-one treated me there like a\r\nbusinessman.”\r\n\r\n“That sounds all very nice,” exclaimed Kamaswami grudgingly, “but I\r\nshould have thought that a businessman is what you actually are! Or did\r\nyou go out there just for your own pleasure?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” laughed Siddhartha, “certainly it was for my own\r\npleasure that I went there. Why else would I have gone there? I have met\r\nnew people, seen new places, enjoyed trust and friendliness, found\r\nfriendship. Listen my friend, if I were Kamaswami I would have hurried\r\nback as soon as I saw that my attempt to purchase was in vain, I would\r\nhave been full of annoyance, and in that case then time and money really\r\nwould have gone to waste. As it is I have spent several days well, I have\r\nlearned things, I have enjoyed the company of friends, I have done no harm\r\nto myself or anyone else either by getting cross or by being in too much\r\nof a hurry. And if I ever go there again, to buy a harvest in advance for\r\ninstance or for any other reason, I will have a friendly welcome from\r\ncheerful people, and I will congratulate myself for not having been rushed\r\nor bad tempered this time. So leave things well enough alone, my friend,\r\ndon’t harm yourself by telling me off! If the day ever comes when you\r\nsee that Siddhartha has brought you any harm then just say the word and\r\nSiddhartha will go on his way. But till then let us just be content with\r\neach other as we are.”\r\n\r\nThe businessman tried to persuade Siddhartha by saying he was eating his,\r\nKamaswami’s, bread, but this too was in vain. It was his own bread that\r\nhe ate, or rather both of them ate the bread of others, the bread of\r\neveryone. Siddhartha never had an ear for Kamaswami’s worries, and\r\nKamaswami made many worries for himself. If a deal was in process that\r\nmight go badly, if goods dispatched seemed to have been lost, if a debtor\r\nseemed unable to pay, Kamaswami was never able to convince his co-worker\r\nthat it would be of any use to speak words of anger or concern, to furrow\r\none’s brow, to lose any sleep. One time when Kamaswami reproached\r\nSiddhartha the claim that everything he knew he had learned from him,\r\nSiddhartha replied, “Don’t be so ridiculous! What I have learnt from\r\nyou is the price of a basket of fish and how much interest you can exact\r\nfor money you lend. Those things are your kind of knowledge. You have\r\nnever taught me to think, my dear Kamaswami, it might be better if you\r\nwanted to learn thinking from me.”\r\n\r\nIt was true that Siddhartha’s heart was not in business. Business was\r\ngood for him to obtain money for Kamala, and he obtained much more than he\r\nneeded. Moreover, Siddhartha was only concerned with people. Their\r\nbusiness, craft, worries, pleasures and follies had earlier been as\r\nstrange and distant as the moon, but now he took an interest in them. He\r\nhad no difficulty in talking with everyone, to live with everyone, to\r\nlearn from everyone, but the easier this was the more he became aware that\r\nthere was something that separated him from them, and that was because he\r\nhad been a samana. He saw how people lived their lives in a way that was\r\nlike children or animals, something he both loved and despised. He saw\r\ntheir strivings, saw their sufferings and saw them turn grey about things\r\nthat seemed to him not worth that price, about money, about petty\r\npleasures, matters of petty honour, he saw them shouting and insulting\r\neach other, he saw them lamenting for pains which a samana would merely\r\nsmile at, and for losses which a samana does not feel.\r\n\r\nHe was open to everything that these people brought him. The businessman\r\nwas welcome who brought canvas for him to buy, the debtor was welcome who\r\ncame asking for a loan, the beggar was welcome who spent an hour to tell\r\nhim the story of his poverty but who was not half as poor as any samana.\r\nHe behaved toward the rich foreign businessman in the same way as to the\r\nservant who shaved him or the street seller, and would allow him to cheat\r\nhim of a few petty coins when he bought bananas. When Kamaswami came to\r\nhim to lament his troubles or to accuse him of having handled a deal badly\r\nhe listened to him with cheerful interest, wondered about him, tried to\r\nunderstand him, acknowledged that he was right on some small points when\r\nhe had to, and then he would turn away to the next person who wanted his\r\nattention. And there were many who did want it, many who came to do\r\nbusiness with him, many who came to cheat him, many who came to obtain\r\ninformation from him, many who wanted his pity, many who wanted his\r\nadvice. He gave advice, he showed pity, he gave advice, he allowed himself\r\nto be cheated, slightly, and all this game, and all the passion with which\r\nall these people played it, occupied his thoughts just as much as, at one\r\ntime, thoughts about the gods and about Brahman.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time he would feel, deep in his breast, a faint and tender\r\nvoice that gently admonished, gently complained, so gentle he was hardly\r\naware of it. Then he would become aware for an hour of what an odd life he\r\nwas leading, that he was doing all these things just as a game, that\r\nalthough he was cheerful and felt moments of pleasure his real life was\r\nflowing past without touching him. He played with his business affairs and\r\nthe people he came into contact with in the same way as a sportsman plays\r\nwith his ball, he watched them and found fun in so doing; in his heart, in\r\nthe source of his being, he was not present. There was a place where that\r\nsource flowed, but how far that place was from him, flowing and flowing\r\nout of sight, no longer had anything to do with his life. And there were\r\ntimes when he was alarmed at thoughts of this sort, and he wished he too\r\ncould be granted a passion for all the childish to activity of the day, to\r\ntake part in it with his heart, truly to live, truly to do, truly to enjoy\r\nlife instead of just standing at one side of it as an onlooker. But he\r\nalways went back to the beautiful Kamala, learned the art of love,\r\npractised the cult of lust by which, more than anywhere else, giving and\r\ntaking become the same thing, he talked with her, learned from her, gave\r\nher his advice, accepted her advice. She understood him better than\r\nGovinda once had, she was more like him than Govinda had been.\r\n\r\nOne day he said to her, “You are like me, you are different from most\r\npeople. You are Kamala, nothing else, and deep inside you there is peace\r\nand a refuge where you can go at any time and feel that that is your\r\nplace, just as I can. Few people have that, though all people could have\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“Not all people are clever,” said Kamala.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Siddhartha, “that is not what it is about. Kamaswami is\r\njust as clever as I am, but he has no place of refuge within himself.\r\nOthers have one, people whose understanding is like that of a small child.\r\nMost people, Kamala, are like a leaf falling through the air and is blown\r\nfrom side to side, it twists, it staggers, till it hits the ground. There\r\nare others, though not many, who are like the stars, they follow a fixed\r\ncourse, no wind blows them, they have their laws and their path set within\r\nthemselves. All the learned men and all the samanas - and I have known\r\nmany of them - had one of this sort among them, a perfect one, and I can\r\nnever forget him. He is Gotama, the noble one who disseminated that\r\nteaching. Thousands of young men listen to his teachings every day, they\r\nfollow his precepts every hour of every day, but each one of them is a\r\nfalling leaf, they do not have law and teachings within themselves.”\r\n\r\nKamala looked at him with a smile. “You are talking about him again,”\r\nshe said, “you have your samana thoughts again.”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha was silent, and they played the game of love, one of the thirty\r\nor forty different games that Kamala knew. Her body was as supple as a\r\njaguar’s, and as the bow of a hunter; whoever learned the art of love\r\nfrom her came to know many joys, many secrets. She played long with\r\nSiddhartha, she drew him close, pushed him back, manipulated him,\r\nenveloped him: he enjoyed his mastery until he had been defeated and then,\r\nexhausted, he would rest at her side.\r\n\r\nThe courtesan leant over him, looked long into his face, into his now\r\ntired eyes.\r\n\r\n“You are the best lover,” she said thoughtfully, “I have ever known.\r\nYou are stronger than the others, more supple, more willing. You have\r\nlearnt my art well, Siddhartha. One day, when I am older, I would like to\r\nhave a child from you. But, my love, you have never stopped being a\r\nsamana, and that means you do not love me, there is no-one whom you love.\r\nAm I right?”\r\n\r\n“You might well be right,” said Siddhartha, tired. “I am like you.\r\nYou do not love either - if you did, how could you carry on with love\r\nmaking as a craft? Perhaps people like you and me cannot love. The\r\nchildlike people can; that is their secret.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSANSARA\r\n\r\nSiddhartha had spent a long time in the world of pleasure, though without\r\nbeing a part of it. In his years as a devoted samana he had put his senses\r\nto death but now they woke anew, he had tasted riches, tasted\r\nvoluptuousness, tasted power; but in his heart he had remained a samana\r\nthroughout this lengthy time, just as Kamala, clever Kamala, had seen. His\r\nlife had been directed by the art of thinking, of waiting, of fasting, and\r\nit continued to be so. The people of the world, the childlike people,\r\ncontinued to be strangers for him, just as he was a stranger for them.\r\n\r\nThe years went by and Siddhartha, wrapped in affluence, barely noticed how\r\neach of them passed away. He had become rich, he had long been the owner\r\nof his own house with servants and a garden by the river just outside the\r\ncity. People liked him, they came to him when they needed money or advice,\r\nbut, apart from Kamala, no-one was close to him.\r\n\r\nThat lofty, bright awareness that he had once experienced at the high\r\npoint of his youth in the days after Gotama’s sermon, the time since the\r\nseparation from Govinda, that taut expectation, that proud independence\r\nwithout teachings and without a teacher, that readiness to hear the voice\r\nof the divine from many sources, including his own heart, all this had\r\nslowly turned into mere memories, had become something ephemeral; the\r\nsource of holiness that had once been near to had him become something\r\ndistant, something whose murmurings had become quiet, though it had once\r\nmurmured within him. It was true that much of what he had learned from the\r\nsamanas, that he had learned from Gotama, that he had learned from his\r\nfather the Brahmin, had remained within in him through this time: a modest\r\nlife, the joy of thinking, hours in meditation, secret knowledge of his\r\nself, the eternal self which is neither body nor awareness. Much of it\r\nremained within him, but the rest had little by little sunk down and\r\nbecome covered in dust. Like the potter’s wheel that, once set turning,\r\nwill continue long to turn, and only slowly will tire and lose its motion,\r\nthe wheel of asceticism in Siddhartha’s soul, the wheel of thinking, the\r\nwheel of discernment, continued to turn and was still turning, but it\r\nturned slowly and hesitantly and was close to stopping. Slowly, like damp\r\nthat soaks into the trunk of a dying tree, slowly filling it and making it\r\ndecay, the world and apathy had insidiously soaked into Siddhartha’s\r\nsoul, slowly filling it and making it heavy, making it tired. His senses,\r\nthough, gained vigour, for they had learned much, experienced much.\r\n\r\nSiddhartha had learned how to do business, how to exercise power over\r\npeople, to have pleasure with women, he had learned to wear nice clothes,\r\nto give orders to servants, to bathe in perfumed water. He had learned to\r\neat dainty and carefully prepared foods, even to eat fish and meat and\r\nfowl, spices and sweet things, to drink wine that makes you weary and\r\nforgetful. He had learned to play with dice and on the chess board, to\r\nobserve dancers, to be carried on a litter and to sleep on a soft bed. But\r\nhe had always felt he was different from others, superior to them, he\r\nalways looked on them with a touch of laughter, with a touch of jeering\r\ncontempt, with that very contempt that a samana always feels for people of\r\nthe world. When Kamaswami was in a bad mood, when he became quarrelsome,\r\nwhen he felt he had been treated badly, when he felt over-burdened with\r\nthe worries of business, Siddhartha had always found it laughable. But\r\nslowly and imperceptibly, as harvest times and rainy seasons came and\r\nwent, his contemptuous laughter became more tired, his sense of\r\nsuperiority became subdued. Only slowly, there among his increasing\r\nwealth, Siddhartha had taken on something of the character of the\r\nchildlike people, something of their naivety, something of their anxiety.\r\nAnd yet he envied them, and the more like them he became the more he\r\nenvied them. He envied them for the one thing he did not have and they did\r\nhave, he envied them for the importance they attributed to their lives, he\r\nenvied the passion they felt in their joys and sorrows, envied the worried\r\nbut sweet happiness they had in their never-ending loves. Their love for\r\nthemselves, for women, for their children, for money or honours, for hopes\r\nand plans, these people were always in love with something. But it was not\r\nfrom them that he learned this, especially not their childlike joys and\r\nchildlike follies; what he learned from them was the unpleasant things,\r\nthe things he himself despised. More and more often, in the morning after\r\nspending the evening with friends he would lie long in bed feeling dull\r\nand tired. When Kamaswami bored him with his worries he would become\r\nirritable and impatient. When he lost a game playing at dice he would\r\nlaugh much too loudly. His face was still cleverer and more spiritual than\r\nothers’ but it seldom laughed, and one by one it took on the features so\r\noften seen in the face of rich people, features of discontent, of poor\r\nhealth, of surliness, of apathy, of indifference to others. Slowly, the\r\nsickness of the soul seen in rich people took hold of him.\r\n\r\nWeariness sank over Siddhartha like a veil, like a light mist that with\r\nevery day became a little heavier, every month a little thicker, every\r\nyear a little heavier. As when a new garment becomes old with time, loses\r\nits bright colours with time, gathers stains, gathers creases, becomes\r\nworn at its hems and, here and there, begins to show places that are worn\r\nand threadbare, so Siddhartha’s new life that he had begun when he took\r\nhis leave of Govinda had become old, with the quickly passing years it had\r\nlost its colour and its sheen, it had gathered stains and creases. This\r\nugly sight was hidden at the base of it but here and there it could\r\nalready be seen, disappointment and disgust lay in wait for him.\r\nSiddhartha did not notice. He noticed only that the bright and certain\r\nvoice of his inside which once had woken within him and had led him\r\nthrough his years of splendour had now become silent.\r\n\r\nThe world had taken possession of him, fun, lust, apathy, and lastly that\r\nvery vice that he had most despised and for which he had had the most\r\ncontempt because of its folly, greed. Even property, the owning of riches,\r\nhad finally taken hold of him, it was no longer a frivolous game, it had\r\nbecome his chains and his burden. It was an odd and insidious path that\r\nhad led Siddhartha into this final and most contemptible of dependencies,\r\nplaying dice. To be exact, as soon as, in his heart, he had ceased to be a\r\nsamana, he had begun to gamble for money and dainty luxuries. He had\r\npreviously despised these things, he had previously taken part in them\r\nwith laughing indifference as one of the things done by the childlike\r\npeople, but now he took part with growing aggressivity and passion. Other\r\ngamblers viewed him with fear, few would dare to play against him because\r\nthe stakes he laid down were so high and audacious. Something in his heart\r\ncompelled him to gamble, money was something miserable and when he lost,\r\nwhen he threw it away, it brought him a haughty pleasure, there was no\r\nmore ostentatious way, no more contemptuous way that he could display his\r\ndisdain for riches, the idol of businessmen. So he gambled high and\r\nwithout reserve, he hated himself for this, he despised himself for it, he\r\nthrew it in by the thousand, threw it away by the thousand, he lost money,\r\nlost jewelry, lost a country house, then he won again, then he lost again.\r\nThe anxiety, every terrible and oppressive anxiety he felt while throwing\r\nthe dice for worryingly high stakes was something he loved, he always\r\nsought to renew it, always to raise it, always to tickle it a little\r\nhigher, for it was in this feeling alone that he could feel something like\r\nhappiness, something like inebriation, something like a higher kind of\r\nlife in among the sated, lukewarm, insipid life he led.\r\n\r\nEvery time he lost a large amount he thought of gaining new riches, threw\r\nhimself into business with new vigour and pressed his debtors harder to\r\nmake them pay, for he wished to gamble again, he wanted to squander again,\r\nwanted, again, to display the contempt he had for riches. Siddhartha no\r\nlonger had the indifference he had had when he lost, he no longer had the\r\npatience he had shown for bad debtors, no longer had the goodwill he had\r\npractised toward beggars, no longer had the joy he had felt when he made\r\ngifts or lent money to them who asked, knowing it would not be repaid. He\r\nwould stake ten thousand on a throw of the dice and laugh when he lost it,\r\nbut in his business affairs he became stricter and pettier, and at night\r\nhe sometimes dreamt of money! Whenever he awoke from this vile\r\nenchantment, whenever he looked in the mirror on the bedroom wall and saw\r\nhis face changed and uglier, whenever he felt beset by shame and disgust,\r\nthen he would flee from it, he would flee into new games of chance, flee\r\ninto the numbness of lust, the numbness of wine, and from there flee back\r\ninto piling up more possessions. He ran around in this meaningless circle\r\nuntil he was tired, until he was old, until he was ill.\r\n\r\nUntil he was admonished in a dream. He had spent the evening hours with\r\nKamala in her gorgeous pleasure garden. They had sat talking under the\r\ntrees, and Kamala offered some well-considered words, words with sorrow\r\nand tiredness hidden behind them. She had asked him to tell her about\r\nGotama and could not hear enough about him, the clarity of his eyes, the\r\nquiet beauty of his mouth, the benevolence of his smile, the peace of his\r\nwalk. He had to tell her about the noble buddha for great lengths of time,\r\nand Kamala would sigh and say, “One day, perhaps one day soon, I will go\r\nand follow this buddha too. I will give my pleasure garden to him and take\r\nrefuge in his teachings.” But then she would tease him, she would lead\r\nhim into playful lovemaking, she would chain him to her with a passion\r\nthat was painful, with biting, with tears, as if she wanted, just once\r\nmore, to press the last drops of sweetness out of this life of vain and\r\nshort-lived fun. Never had it been so exceptionally clear to Siddhartha\r\nhow close lust is to death. Then he would lie at her side and Kamala’s\r\nface would come close to his, and, clearer than ever before, he would read\r\na message of anxiety under her eyes and at the corners of her mouth, a\r\nscript of fine lines, of slight wrinkles, a script reminiscent of Autumn\r\nand of growing old just as Siddhartha was himself growing old, for he was\r\nnow in his forties and had noticed grey hairs here and there among the\r\nblack ones. Tiredness could be read on Kamala’s beautiful face,\r\ntiredness from traveling a long road that has no happy ending, tiredness\r\nand the start of her decline, and hidden there, not yet spoken of, was an\r\nanxiety that she was not yet aware of: fear of old age, fear of the\r\nAutumn, fear of the certainty of death. He had taken his leave of her with\r\na sigh, his soul full of lethargy, full of concealed anxiety.\r\n\r\nOne time, when Siddhartha had spent an evening at home with wine and\r\ndancing girls, when he had played the superior with his peers, though he\r\nno longer was their superior, when he had drunk a great deal of wine and,\r\ntired but excited, he had not gone to seek his rest until long after\r\nmidnight, he found himself in a state of despair and was close to tears.\r\nHe waited long in the vain pursuit of sleep, his heart full of a sorrow\r\nthat he thought he could no longer bear, full of disgust that seemed to\r\npermeate every part of him like the vile taste of lukewarm wine, like the\r\nover-sweet and vapid music, like the over-soft smiles on the dancers’\r\nfaces, like the over-sweet scent on their hair and their breasts. But what\r\ndisgusted him more than anything else was himself, his perfumed hair, the\r\nsmell of wine in his mouth, the tired slackness and the dullness of his\r\nskin. Just as one who has eaten or drunk too much will endure his vomiting\r\nand even feel glad at the relief it brings, so Siddhartha, unable to\r\nsleep, felt a gush of monstrous disgust and wished to be relieved of these\r\npleasures, these habits, this entire life of meaninglessness. It was only\r\nwhen the first light of morning came, and the activities in the street in\r\nfront of his house began to wake, that he drowsed, for a few moments felt\r\nsome slight assuagement of his anguish, found something resembling sleep.\r\nAnd that was when he began to dream:\r\n\r\nKamala had a small and rare songbird that she kept in a golden cage. It\r\nwas of this songbird that he dreamed. He dreamt: the bird had become\r\nsilent, though it had formerly always sung in the morning time, and when\r\nhe noticed this he went to the cage and looked in. There he saw the little\r\nbird lying dead and stiff on the floor. He took it out, held it for a\r\nwhile in his hand and then threw it away, out into the street. At that\r\nmoment he felt horror at what he had done and felt such pain in his heart\r\nas if he had thrown out everything of any value, everything of any good\r\nabout himself when he threw this bird out.\r\n\r\nWaking from this dream he felt himself possessed by a deep sorrow.\r\nWorthless, it seemed to him, worthless and meaningless was the life he had\r\nbeen leading; nothing living, nothing that was in anyway beautiful or\r\nworth keeping had remained with him. He stood there alone and empty, like\r\na castaway on the shore.\r\n\r\nIn low spirits, Siddhartha betook himself to one of the pleasure gardens\r\nhe owned, he locked the gate, sat down under a mango tree, felt the death\r\nin his heart and bleakness in his heart, he sat and felt how something in\r\nhim was dying, wilting, coming to its end. Gradually he gathered his\r\nthoughts together and, in his mind, walked once more along the whole of\r\nhis life’s path, beginning at the first day when he was able to think.\r\nWhen was it that he had ever been happy, felt any real joy? Oh yes, he had\r\nexperienced these things many times. He had tasted that joy when, as a\r\nboy, he had been praised by the brahmins and he felt it in his heart,\r\n“There is a path that follows from recitation of holy scripture, from\r\nargument with the learned ones, from excelling when assisting in the\r\nperformance of sacrifice,” Then, what he felt in his heart was, “There\r\nis a path for you to follow, the path to which you are called, the gods\r\nare expecting you.” And again when he was a young man because his\r\nthoughts rose ever higher, they tore out and away from the commonplace\r\nmany who had the same objectives, because he was in accord with the\r\nsufferings and the meanings of Brahman, because when he attained new\r\nwisdom it would only arouse thirst for more knowledge, because, held in\r\nthis thirst, held in the pain of this self, he had always again felt,\r\n“Forward! Forward! You have received the call!” He had accepted this\r\ncall when he left home and chose the life of a samana, and again when he\r\nleft the samanas and sought the path of perfection, although that was also\r\na path into the unknown. How long was it, now, that he had not heard that\r\nvoice, how long was it since he had attained any new heights, how level\r\nand barren had his path become? It had been many years, years without any\r\nhigher objective, no thirsting, no rising, content with petty pleasures\r\nand nonetheless never satisfied! Throughout all these years, without\r\nknowing it himself, he had striven to be a person like these masses, he\r\nhad longed for it, to be like these children and in the process had made a\r\nlife for himself that was much more poor and miserable than theirs, for\r\ntheir objectives were not his objectives, nor were their worries his\r\nworries, all this world of people like Kamaswami had been just a game for\r\nhim, a dance to be looked at, a comedy. Kamala alone was dear to him, was\r\nsomething he valued - but was she still? Did he still need him, or he her?\r\nWere they not playing a game without end? Was it necessary to live a life\r\nfor that? No, it was not necessary? The name of this game was sansara, a\r\nchildren’s game, a game that it was good to play one, twice, ten times -\r\nbut over and over again?\r\n\r\nThen Siddhartha came to see that the game was at its end, that he was no\r\nlonger able to play it. A shudder ran down his body, in his innermost\r\nparts, as he felt that something had died.\r\n\r\nAll that day he sat under the mango tree thinking of his father, thinking\r\nof Govinda, thinking of Gotama. Had he really had to leave these people\r\nand become a Kamaswami? He still sat there as night began to fall. When\r\nlooked up and saw the stars he thought, “Here I am, sitting under my own\r\nmango tree, in my own pleasure garden.” A faint smile came to his face -\r\nwas it necessary, then, was it proper, was it not a foolish game to be the\r\nowner of a mango tree, to be the owner of a garden?\r\n\r\nHe put an end to this too, this too died within him. He rose, took his\r\nleave of the mango tree, took his leave of the pleasure garden. He had not\r\neaten all day and so felt very hungry, he thought of his house in the\r\ncity, of his chambers there and his bed, he thought of the table laden\r\nwith food. With a weary smile he shook his head and took his leave of\r\nthese things.\r\n\r\nThere and then, at that hour of the night, Siddhartha left his garden,\r\nleft the city and never returned to them. Kamaswami had his servants\r\nsearch long for him, he thought he had fallen into the hands of bandits.\r\nKamala did not send anyone to search for him. She was not surprised when\r\nshe heard of Siddhartha’s disappearance. Was it not something she had\r\nalways expected? Was he not a samana, a pilgrim without a home? And she\r\nhad felt it most of all when she was last with him, and deep within her\r\npain at losing him she was glad, glad that she had drawn him so deep into\r\nher heart that last time she saw him, glad that she had once more felt so\r\nentirely possessed and pervaded by him.\r\n\r\nWhen she first received the news of Siddhartha’s disappearance she\r\ncrossed to the window, where she kept a rare songbird captive in a golden\r\ncage. She opened the door of the cage, took the bird out and let him fly\r\naway. She looked long after him as he flew. From that day on she received\r\nno more visitors and kept her house closed. But some while later she\r\nbecame aware that her last meeting with Siddhartha had left her pregnant.\r\n\r\n\r\nBESIDE THE RIVER\r\n\r\nSiddhartha wandered through the woods, already far from the city, and he\r\nknew just one thing, that he could never go back, that this life that he\r\nhad lived through many years was ended and gone, he had tasted its joys,\r\nsucked out its pleasures, till it disgusted him. The songbird he had\r\ndreamt of was dead. The songbird in his heart was dead. He had been\r\nentangled deep in sansara, he had drawn death and disgust into himself\r\nfrom every side, like a sponge sucking in water till it is saturated. He\r\nwas full of weariness, full of misery, full of death, there was nothing\r\nmore in the world that could appeal to him, could give him pleasure, could\r\ngive him reassurance.\r\n\r\nHe yearned to know nothing more about himself, to have peace, to be dead.\r\nIf only a thunderbolt would come and strike him down! If only a tiger\r\nwould come and eat him! If only he had wine, poison, that would numb his\r\nsenses, oblivion and sleep, never more to wake! Was there any kind of\r\nfilth left with which he had not already besmirched himself, was there any\r\nkind of sin or folly that he had not committed, anything he had not done\r\nthat for his soul was entirely fruitless? Was it even possible still to\r\nlive? Was it possible to draw in breath, let out breath over and over\r\nagain, to feel hunger, once more to eat, once more to sleep, once more to\r\nlay with a woman? Was this circle not, for him, exhausted and closed off?\r\n\r\nSiddhartha arrived at the great river that flowed through the wood, the\r\nsame river that the ferryman had taken him across when he was a young man\r\nand had just departed from Gotama’s community. On the bank of this river\r\nhe stopped and he stood there, uncertain what to do. He was weak from\r\ntiredness and hunger, and why should he go on, where to, what for? No, he\r\nhad no objectives any more, there was nothing but the deep and sorrowful\r\nyearning to shake all this barren dream from himself, to pour away this\r\nstale wine, to put an end to this pitiful and shameful life.\r\n\r\nThere was a tree that hung over the river bank, a coconut tree. Siddhartha\r\nleant his shoulder against it, put his arms around the trunk and looked\r\ndown into the green water as it continued to flow beneath him. He looked\r\ndown into it and found himself possessed with the wish to let go of the\r\ntree and to perish in the water. A grisly emptiness was reflected back at\r\nhim from the water, a reflection that showed the awful emptiness of his\r\nsoul. Yes, he had come to the end. There was nothing more for him than to\r\nextinguish himself, than to strike down the picture of deformity that was\r\nhis life, to throw it down at the feet of the gods who laugh at him in\r\ncontempt. This was the great breakthrough that he had longed for: death,\r\nthe destruction of the form he hated! The fish could come and eat him,\r\nSiddhartha the dog, the deluded, the decayed and putrid body and the\r\nflaccid and abused soul! The fish and the crocodiles could come and eat\r\nhim, the demons could dismember him!\r\n\r\nHis face distorted into a scowl he stared into the water, saw his\r\ndistorted face mirrored back at him, and he spat at it. Deep in tiredness\r\nhe loosened his arm from the tree trunk and twisted round slightly so that\r\nhe would fall vertically and finally go under. With eyes closed he sank\r\ndown to meet his death.\r\n\r\nFrom some distant place his soul began to twitch, from some time past in\r\nhis tired life came a sound. It was one word, one syllable which he\r\nuttered to himself without a thought and with voice that mumbled, the\r\nancient word that formed the beginning and the end of any brahmanist\r\nprayer, the holy word “OM”, meaning “perfection” or\r\n“completion.” And at the moment when the sound of “Om” touched\r\nSiddhartha’s ear his dormant spirit suddenly awoke and saw the folly of\r\nwhat he was doing.\r\n\r\nSiddhartha was deeply shocked. So this was the state he had come to, this\r\nwas how lost he was, how confused. He was so forsaken by any kind of\r\nwisdom that he was able to seek death, that this whim, this childish whim,\r\ncould have grown within him: to find peace by extinguishing his body! All\r\nthat he had recently suffered, all the disillusionment, all the doubts,\r\nnone of these things had the effect on him that Om had at that moment as\r\nit entered his consciousness: and he became able to see his misery and his\r\nfolly.\r\n\r\nOm! he said to himself: Om! And he knew of Brahman, knew that life could\r\nnot be destroyed, knew once more everything about the divine that he had\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nAll this, however, lasted for just one moment, just a flash. Siddhartha\r\nsank down at the foot of the coconut tree, lay down exhausted, and\r\nmuttering Om he laid his head on the root of the tree and sank into a deep\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nDeep was his sleep and free of dreams, he had not known sleep like this\r\nfor a long time. Many hours later when he woke it seemed to him that ten\r\nyears had gone by, he heard the gentle flow of the water, did not know\r\nwhere he was or who had brought him there, abruptly he opened his eyes and\r\nwas amazed to see trees and the sky above him, and then he remembered\r\nwhere he was and how he had arrived there. This process took a long time,\r\nthough, and the past seemed to him to have had a veil thrown over it, it\r\nwas infinitely far, it lay at infinite distance, infinitely meaningless.\r\nHe knew only that his previous life (at first as he came back to his\r\nsenses, this previous life seemed like something lying long in the past,\r\nan earlier incarnation, an early birth of his present self), that his\r\nprevious life was something he had left behind, that, full of disgust and\r\nmisery, he had even wanted to throw his life away, that instead he had\r\nregained consciousness at the side of a river under a coconut tree with\r\nthe holy word Om on his lips, that he had then slept and now had woken and\r\nhe looked at the world as a new person. Quietly, he spoke the word Om to\r\nhimself, as he had done while he was falling asleep, and it seemed that\r\nall the time that he had been asleep had been nothing but a long immersion\r\ninto saying Om, into thinking Om, a submersion and envelopment in Om, in\r\nthe nameless, in the perfect.\r\n\r\nIt had been such a wonderful sleep! Sleeping had never before left him so\r\nrefreshed, so renewed, so rejuvenated! Could it be that he really had\r\ndied, had gone under and now been reborn in a new form? No, he knew\r\nhimself, he knew his hand and his feet, knew the play where he lay, knew\r\nthis self in his breast, this Siddhartha, the headstrong, the odd, this\r\nSiddhartha however was transformed, renewed, he had slept remarkably well\r\nand now he was remarkably alert, joyful and inquisitive.\r\n\r\nSiddhartha sat up straight and saw a man facing him, a strange man, a monk\r\nin yellow robes with shaven head and in a position of meditation. He\r\nlooked at the man, who had hair neither on his head nor his face, and he\r\nhad not looked at him for long before he saw that this monk was Govinda,\r\nhis childhood friend, Govinda who had taken refuge with the noble Buddha.\r\nGovinda had changed, just as he had, but he still bore the old features in\r\nhis face that spoke of zeal, of loyalty, of searching, of fastidiousness.\r\nGovinda felt now that Siddhartha was watching him, opened his eyes and\r\nreturned his gaze. Siddhartha saw that Govinda did not recognise him.\r\nGovinda was glad to see that he had woken, he had clearly long been\r\nsitting here waiting for him to wake even though he did not know him.\r\n\r\n“I have been sleeping,” said Siddhartha. “What has brought you\r\nhere?”\r\n\r\n“You have been sleeping,” Govinda answered. “It is not good to sleep\r\nin places such as this where there are many snakes and where the beasts of\r\nthe forest follow their paths. I, sir, am a follower of the noble Gotama,\r\nof the buddha, of the Sakyamuni, and when I and a number of members of our\r\nmovement were travelling along this path in pilgrimage I saw you lying\r\nthere asleep in a place where to sleep is dangerous. I therefore tried to\r\nwake you, sir, and as I saw that your sleep was very deep I remained\r\nbehind my colleagues and sat beside you. And then, it seems, I fell asleep\r\nmyself despite my wish to watch over you as you slept. I performed my task\r\nbadly, tiredness overcame me. But now, now that you are awake, please\r\nallow me to leave you and catch up with my brothers.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you for watching over my sleep, samana,” said Siddhartha.\r\n“You followers of the noble one are helpful. You are free to go.”\r\n\r\n“I will go, sir. May you always fare well.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, samana.”\r\n\r\nGovinda made the gesture of greeting and said, “Farewell.”\r\n\r\n“Farewell, Govinda,” said Siddhartha.\r\n\r\nThe monk remained where he was.\r\n\r\n“Sir, may I ask how you know my name?”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha smiled.\r\n\r\n“I know you, Govinda, I know you from your father’s hut and from the\r\nbrahmins’ school, I know you from the sacrifices we performed and from\r\nour journey to join the samanas, I know you from that time when, in the\r\ngrove of Jetavana, you took refuge with the noble one.”\r\n\r\n“You are Siddhartha!” exclaimed Govinda out loud. “Now I recognise\r\nyou, and I cannot understand why I did not recognise immediately. Welcome,\r\nSiddhartha, it is a great joy for me to see you again.”\r\n\r\n“And it is a great joy for me too to see you. It was you who watched\r\nover me as I slept, and I thank you again for it, although I had no need\r\nof anyone to do so. Where are you going, my friend?”\r\n\r\n“I am not going anywhere. We monks are always travelling, except in the\r\nrainy season, we always move from place to place, we live according to our\r\nrules, we spread out teachings, accept alms and then we move on. It is\r\nalways so. But you, Siddhartha, where are you going?”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha said, “It is the same with me as with you, my friend. I am\r\nnot going anywhere. I am simply travelling. I am on a pilgrimage.”\r\n\r\nGovinda said, “You say you are on a pilgrimage, and I believe you. But,\r\nSiddhartha forgive me, you do not look like a pilgrim. You wear the\r\nclothes of a rich man, you wear the shoes of a man of elegance, your hair\r\nsmells of scented water and it is not the hair of a pilgrim, not the hair\r\nof a samana.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my friend, well observed, your sharp eye sees everything. But I\r\ndid not tell you I am a samana. I said I am on a pilgrimage, and that is\r\nwhat I am, on a pilgrimage.”\r\n\r\n“You are on a pilgrimage,” said Govinda. “I have been going on\r\npilgrimage for many years, but I have never come across a pilgrim like\r\nthis. There are not many who go on pilgrimage in clothes like this, or in\r\nshoes like this or with hair like this.”\r\n\r\n“I believe you, my friend. But now, today, you have just a pilgrim like\r\nthis, in shoes like this, with clothes like this. Remember this, my\r\nfriend: The world of forms is transitory, our clothes are highly\r\ntransitory, just like the way we have our hair and the hair itself and our\r\nbodies themselves. I am wearing the clothes of a rich man, you are quite\r\nright about what you have seen. I am wearing them because I was a rich\r\nman, and my hair is like the hair of a libertine or men of the world,\r\nbecause I was a libertine and a man of the world.”\r\n\r\n“And now, Siddhartha, what are you now?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know, I do not know it any more than you do. I am on a\r\njourney. I was a rich man and now I am not; and nor do I know what I will\r\nbe tomorrow.”\r\n\r\n“Did you lose all your riches?”\r\n\r\n“I lost them, or they lost me. I no longer have them. The wheel of forms\r\nspins fast, Govinda. Where is Siddhartha the brahmin? Where is Siddhartha\r\nthe samana. Where is the wealth of Siddhartha? Things that are transitory\r\nchange fast, Govinda, you know that.”\r\n\r\nGovinda stared long at his childhood friend, his eyes full of doubt. Then,\r\nusing words that were very polite, he said goodbye and went on his way.\r\n\r\nWith a smile on his face, Siddhartha watched him as he went, he loved him\r\nstill, faithful Govinda, conscientious Govinda. And how, at that moment,\r\nat that magnificent time after such a wonderful sleep permeated with Om,\r\nhow could he not have loved someone and something? This was the very magic\r\nthat had taken place in him by the power of Om while he was sleeping, he\r\nloved everything, he was filled with joyful love for everything he saw. It\r\nwas also the reason, it seemed to him now, why he had earlier been very\r\nill and unable to love anything or anyone.\r\n\r\nWith a smile on his face, Siddhartha watched the monk as he went. He felt\r\nmuch stronger after his sleep, but he was nonetheless painfully hungry as\r\nhe had not eaten for two days and the time was long past when he had been\r\nhardened against hunger. With some sorrow, but also with laughter, he\r\nthought about that time. In those days, he remembered, he had boasted of\r\nthree things to Kamala, three noble and invincible arts that he had\r\nmastered: fasting, waiting, thinking. These were his possessions, his\r\npower and his skill, his firm and trusty staff, these three arts were what\r\nhe had learned in the hard-working and arduous years of his youth, these\r\nand no others. And now he had abandoned them, not one of them was in his\r\npossession any longer, not fasting, not waiting, not thinking. He had\r\nthrown them away for the most miserable of desires, for the most\r\nshort-lived, for sensual pleasure, for affluence, for riches! They had\r\nrarely done him any good. And now, it seemed, he really had become one of\r\nthe childlike people.\r\n\r\nSiddhartha thought about his position. Thinking came hard to him, there\r\nwas nothing in him that wanted to do it, but he forced himself.\r\n\r\nNow, he thought, as all these transitory things have slipped away from me,\r\nnow I stand here under the sun again as I did before when I was a small\r\nchild, there is nothing that belongs to me, there is nothing I can do,\r\nnothing I am capable of doing, there is nothing I have learnt. This is\r\nwonderful! Now, when I am no longer young, when my hair is already\r\nhalf-grey, when my strength is beginning to fade, now is the time for me\r\nto start again from the beginning and be a child again! His fortunes had\r\nindeed been odd! He had been on a downward path and now he stood in the\r\nworld once again penniless and naked and stupid. But he was unable to feel\r\nany concern about this, no, he even felt a strong urge to laugh, to laugh\r\nat himself, to laugh at this bizarre, ridiculous world.\r\n\r\n“You’re on a downward path!” he said to himself, and laughed about\r\nit, and as he spoke his glance fell on the river, and he saw that the\r\nriver was on a downward path too, always migrating downwards and, as it\r\ndid so, it sang and was gay. He found that very pleasing, and he gave the\r\nriver a friendly smile. Was this not the river in which he had wanted to\r\ndrown himself, some time in the past, a hundred years ago, or had he\r\ndreamt it?\r\n\r\nMy life truly has been wonderful, he thought, wonderful are the varied\r\ncourses it has taken. As a boy I had nothing to do with anything but the\r\ngods and making sacrifices to them. As an adolescent I had nothing to do\r\nwith anything but asceticism, with thinking and meditation, I sought to\r\nfind Brahman, venerated the eternal in Atman. As a young man, though, I\r\nfollowed the path of penitence, lived in the forest, suffered heat and\r\nfrost, learnt to hunger, taught my body to die away. It was wonderful\r\nwhen, at that time, knowledge came to me through the teachings of the\r\ngreat buddha, I felt knowledge of the unity of the world, felt it flow\r\nwithin me like my own blood. But I had to go on my way even from the\r\nbuddha and that great knowledge. I went on and learnt the joy of love from\r\nKamala, learned business skills from Kamaswami, accumulated money, wasted\r\nmoney, learned to love my stomach, learned to flatter my senses. It took\r\nme many years to lose my spirit, to lose the ability to think, to forget\r\nunity. Is it not so, that I went slowly and by circuitous routes from\r\nbeing a man to being a child, from a thinking being to a childlike being?\r\nThis was a very good way, though, and the bird within my breast did not\r\ndie. But what a way it was! There was so much stupidity, so much vice, so\r\nmuch folly, so much disgust and disappointment and misery that I had to go\r\nthrough before simply becoming a child again and to be able to start anew.\r\nBut it was the right way, my heart tells me yes, my eyes laugh about it. I\r\nhad to experience doubt, I had to sink down to that most foolish of\r\nthoughts, the thought of suicide, before I could experience mercy, before\r\nI could hear Om again, before I could sleep properly again and before I\r\ncould wake properly again. I had to become a fool before I could find\r\nAtman within myself again. I had to commit sin before I could live again.\r\nWhere will my path lead me from here? This is a foolish path, it goes\r\nround in loops, perhaps it goes round in circles. Whichever way it chooses\r\nto go, I will follow it.\r\n\r\nIn his breast he felt a surge of wonderful joy.\r\n\r\nWhere from then, he asked his heart, where from do you have this gaiety?\r\nCould it be that it comes from that long and wholesome sleep that did me\r\nso much good? Or from the word Om that I spoke? Or could it be because I\r\nhave escaped, that my flight is completed, that I am at last free again\r\nand stand once more under the sky as a child? I have escaped, I have\r\nbecome free, and it is so good! How pure and lovely the air is here, how\r\ngood to breathe it! There, the place whence I escaped, everything smelt of\r\nointment, of spices, of wine, of excess, of lethargy. How I hated this\r\nworld of the rich, of the world of luxury, the world of gamblers! How I\r\nhated myself for staying so long in this dreadful world! How I hated\r\nmyself, robbed myself, poisoned and tortured myself, how I made myself old\r\nand bad tempered! No, I will never again delude myself, as I so much used\r\nto like doing, never again think that Siddhartha is a wise man! But this\r\nis something it was right to do, this is something that pleases me, this\r\nis something for which I should praise myself, that I have put an end to\r\nthis self-hatred, to this life of folly and barrenness! I praise you,\r\nSiddhartha, after so many years of folly you have once again had an idea,\r\nyou have done something, you have heard the bird singing in your breast\r\nand you have followed him!\r\n\r\nThus he praised himself, had pleasure in himself, listened with curiosity\r\nto his stomach, which was rumbling with hunger. In the last few days, he\r\nfelt, he had tasted pain, he had tasted sorrow, he had tasted them\r\ncompletely and thoroughly, he had eaten them totally to the point of doubt\r\nand of death and then he had spat them out. It was good, so. He could have\r\nremained much longer with Kamaswami, making money, wasting money, filling\r\nhis belly and letting his soul go thirsty, he could have lived much longer\r\nin this soft, well-cushioned Hell if this had not happened: that moment of\r\nperfect doubt and despair, that moment when he was at such an extreme that\r\nhe hung over the flowing water and was ready to destroy himself. He had\r\nfelt doubts and the deepest disgust but had not succumbed to them, the\r\nbird within him that was his voice and his source of gaiety was still\r\nliving, and this filled him with joy, this brought him to laughter, this\r\nmade his face, under his grey hair, beam.\r\n\r\n“It is good,” he thought, “to experience everything you need to know\r\nyourself. I learned as a child that wealth and worldly pleasures are not\r\ngood. It is something that I have long known but only now experienced. And\r\nnow I know it, I know it not only in my thoughts but with my eyes, with my\r\nheart, with my stomach. It is good for me that I know it!”\r\n\r\nHe thought long about his transformation, he listened to the bird as it\r\nsang for joy. Had this bird within him not died, had he not felt its\r\ndeath? No, it was something else within him that had died, something that\r\nhad long been yearning for death. Was it not this that in his earlier\r\nyears of fervent penitence he had wanted to kill off? Was it not his Self,\r\nhis petty, anxious and proud Self, that he had struggled against for so\r\nmany years that found victory over him again and again, that reappeared\r\neach time he killed it off, each time he forbade himself pleasure, each\r\ntime he was afraid? Was it not this that today had finally found its\r\ndeath, here in the woods by this lovely river? Was it not because of this\r\ndeath that he was now like a child, so full of trust, so without fear, so\r\nfull of joy?\r\n\r\nSiddhartha now also began to understand why his efforts against this Self\r\nwere in vain when he was a brahmin, when he was a penitent. He had been\r\nhindered by too much knowledge, too much of the holy verses, too many\r\nrules of sacrifice, too much castigation, too much doing and too much\r\nstriving! He had been full of pride, he had been always the cleverest,\r\nalways the keenest, always one step ahead of the others, always the one\r\nwho knew, the one who was spiritual, always the priest or the wise man.\r\nHis Self had crept into this priesthood, into this pride, into this\r\nspirituality, it sat firmly there and grew while Siddhartha thought he was\r\ndestroying it with fasting and penitence. Now he could see it, and he saw\r\nthat the secret voice had been right, that no teacher could ever have\r\nremoved this Self. That is why he had had to go out into the world, to\r\nlose himself in fun and power and women and money, had had to be a\r\nbusinessman, a gambler, a drinker and to be greedy, till the priest and\r\nthe samana within him were dead. That is why he had had to continue to\r\nendure these years of loathsomeness, to bear the disgust, the emptiness,\r\nthe meaninglessness, of a life that was lost and barren, right till the\r\nend, till the bitter doubt, till Siddhartha the sybarite, Siddhartha the\r\ngreedy, was even ready to die. He did die, a new Siddhartha awoke from\r\nthat sleep. Even he would grow old, even he would have to die one day,\r\nSiddhartha was impermanent, every form was impermanent. But today he was\r\nyoung, he was a child, and the new Siddhartha was full of joy.\r\n\r\nThese were his thoughts, he listened with a smile to his stomach, listened\r\nwith gratitude to a buzzing bee. He looked happily into the river as it\r\nflowed, water had never been to pleasing to him as this water, he had\r\nnever been so strongly aware of the beauty of water, of its voice, of what\r\nit represents. The river seemed to have something special to say to him,\r\nsomething he still did not know, something still waiting for him. This was\r\nthe river where Siddhartha had wanted to drown himself, this was the river\r\nwhere the old, tired, doubting Siddhartha today had drowned. But the new\r\nSiddhartha felt profound love for this rushing water and he promised\r\nhimself never again to be so rash in leaving it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FERRYMAN\r\n\r\nI would like to remain by this river, thought Siddhartha, it is the same\r\nriver that I once crossed on my way to the childlike people, that time I\r\nwas taken across by a friendly ferryman, I would like to go to him. It was\r\nfrom his hut that my way once led out into a new life, a life which now\r\nhas become old and dead - I hope the way I am now on, the new life that I\r\nhave begun, take its starting point from there!\r\n\r\nHe looked tenderly into the flowing water, into that transparent green,\r\ninto the crystal lines of its drawing that was so full of secrets. He saw\r\npearls of light rising from its depths, peaceful bubbles of air floating\r\non its surface, the blue of the sky reflected there. With its thousand\r\neyes the river looked back at him, eyes of green, eyes of white, eyes of\r\ncrystal, eyes of Heavenly blue. How he loved this water, how it delighted\r\nhim, how he was grateful to it! In his heart he heard the newly-woken\r\nvoice speak, and it said to him, “Love this water! Stay beside it! Learn\r\nfrom it!” Oh yes, he did want to learn from it, he did want to listen to\r\nit. Whoever understood this water and its secrets, it seemed to him, would\r\nalso have understanding of many other things, many secrets, all secrets.\r\n\r\nOf the river’s secrets, however, he saw today just one, and it was\r\nunderstood by his soul. He saw: this water flowed and flowed, it never\r\nceased to flow but was nonetheless always there, it was always and for all\r\ntime the same, yet each glance at it showed something new! Whoever could\r\ngrasp this would understand it! He understood but could not grasp it, he\r\nfelt no more than the rising of some vague notion, a distant memory,\r\nvoices of gods.\r\n\r\nSiddhartha stood up, for the power of hunger in his body was becoming\r\nunbearable. He walked on not caring whither he went, he followed the path\r\nalong the river bank as it led him upstream, he listened to its flow,\r\nlistened to growling hunger in his body.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the place where the ferry made its crossings he found the\r\nboat lying ready and standing in it was the same ferryman who had once\r\ntaken the young samana across. Siddhartha recognised him, though he too\r\nwas greatly altered.\r\n\r\n“Would you like to take me across?” he asked.\r\n\r\nThe ferryman, astonished to see such an elegant man travelling alone and\r\non foot, accepted him into the boat and pushed off from the bank.\r\n\r\n“You have chosen a nice life for yourself,” said the passenger. “It\r\nmust be nice to have a life beside this water every day and to travel on\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“It is very nice, sir,” said the oarsman, smiling as he rowed, “just\r\nas you say. But is not every life nice, is not every job a good job?”\r\n\r\n“You could well be right. But I still envy you your job.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you would soon become tired of it. It is not a job for a gentleman\r\nin fine clothes.”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha laughed. “This is not the first time today that I have been\r\njudged by the clothes I wear, judged and mistrusted. Ferryman, would you\r\nnot like to take these clothes from me? They have become burdensome to me.\r\nAnd I think you already know I have no money to pay your fare.”\r\n\r\n“The gentleman is joking with me,” the ferryman laughed.\r\n\r\n“I am not joking, my friend. Listen, you have once before carried me\r\nacross the water in your boat and you did it for the love of God. Do the\r\nsame today, and accept my clothes in return.”\r\n\r\n“Does the gentleman mean to continue his journey without clothes?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, most of all I would like not to continue my journey at all. Most of\r\nall, ferryman, I would like you to give me an old loincloth and take me on\r\nas your assistant, or rather as your apprentice, for I would need first to\r\nlearn how to handle the boat.”\r\n\r\nThe ferryman stared long and quizzically at the stranger.\r\n\r\n“Now I recognise you,” he said at last. “You slept in my hut once,\r\nthat was long ago, it must be more than twenty years, you were taken over\r\nthe river by me and we took leave of each other as good friends. Were you\r\nnot a samana? I can’t think what your name is any more.”\r\n\r\n“My name is Siddhartha, and I was a samana the last time you saw me.”\r\n\r\n“Welcome, Siddhartha. My name is Vasudeva. I hope you will again be my\r\nguest today and sleep in my hut and tell me all about where you have come\r\nfrom and why your fine clothes are such a burden to you.”\r\n\r\nThey had reached the middle of the river and Vasudeva pulled harder on the\r\noars in order to overcome the current. He worked quietly with his powerful\r\narms and with his eye on the bow. Siddhartha sat and watched him and\r\nremembered how, once before, in the last days of his time as a samana,\r\nlove for this man had arisen in his heart. He accepted Vasudeva’s\r\ninvitation with gratitude. When they reached the bank Siddhartha helped\r\nhim to tether the boat and the ferryman invited him into the hut where he\r\noffered him bread and water, and Siddhartha ate hungrily, and he ate\r\nhungrily of the mangoes that Vasudeva offered him.\r\n\r\nThe sun had begun to set, and they went to sit on a tree trunk at the side\r\nof the river where Siddhartha told the ferryman about where he was from\r\nand what his life had been, about how he had seen it before his eyes that\r\nday in his moment of doubt. His story continued late into the night.\r\n\r\nVasudeva listened with great attention. He took in all that he heard, his\r\norigin and childhood, all that learning, all that seeking, all that joy,\r\nall that suffering. This was one of the ferryman’s greatest virtues: few\r\nknew how to listen as well as he. Vasudeva would not say a word, but the\r\nspeaker would sense how he allowed the words to enter into him, quiet,\r\nopen, patient, never losing a word, never waiting impatiently for a word,\r\nnever offering praise nor censure, simply listening. Siddhartha was aware\r\nof what good fortune it was to have the company of a listener such as\r\nthis, one into whose heart he could sink his own life, his own searchings,\r\nhis own sorrows.\r\n\r\nAs Siddhartha neared the end of his story, though, as he spoke of the tree\r\nat the riverside and of the depth of his fall, of the holy Om and of how\r\nhe felt such love for the river when he woke from his sleep, then the\r\nferryman listened with twice as much attention, totally devoted to it with\r\nhis eyes shut.\r\n\r\nBut when Siddhartha became silent and there was a long period of\r\nstillness, Vasudeva said, “It is just as I thought. The river spoke to\r\nyou. He is the friend of you also, he speaks to you also. That is good,\r\nthat is very good. Stay with me, Siddhartha my friend. I had a wife once,\r\nher place was next to mine, but it is long since she died, I have lived\r\nlong alone. Now you live with me, there is room here and there is food\r\nhere for both of us.”\r\n\r\n“I thank you,” said Siddhartha, “I thank you and I accept. And I\r\nalso thank you, Vasudeva, for being such a good listener! There are few\r\npeople who know how to listen. And I have never come across anyone who\r\ncould do it as well as you. This is something else that I shall be\r\nlearning from you.”\r\n\r\n“You will learn,” said Vasudeva, “but not from me. It is the river\r\nthat taught me how to listen, and he will teach you too. He knows\r\neverything, the river, there is nothing you cannot learn from him. Look,\r\nthis is something else that you have already learned from the river, that\r\nit is good to strive to go down, to sink, to seek out the depths. The rich\r\nand courtly Siddhartha will become an apprentice oarsman, the learned\r\nbrahmin Siddhartha will become a ferryman: this is something else that the\r\nriver has told you. And there is more that you will learn from him.”\r\n\r\nThere was a long pause, and Siddhartha said, “What more, Vasudeva?”\r\n\r\nVasudeva stood up. “It is getting late,” he said, “let us go to bed.\r\nI cannot tell you what more, my friend. You will learn, perhaps you even\r\nknow it already. I am not a learned man, you see, I do not know how to\r\ngive speeches, I do not know how to think. All I know how to do is\r\nlistening and saying my prayers, there is nothing else I have learned how\r\nto do. If I could explain it to you and give lessons then that might mean\r\nI am a wise man, but as it is I am just a ferryman and it is my job to\r\ntake people across this river. It could have been thousands that I have\r\ntaken across and all that my river has ever been to them is something that\r\nhas gotten in the way on their journey. They have been travelling for the\r\nsake of money or business, going to weddings, going on a pilgrimage, and\r\nthe river was in their way and the ferryman was there so that they could\r\nget past that thing in their way as soon as possible. Some of those\r\nthousands though, some of them, though not many, four or five of them, for\r\nsome of them the river stopped being just something in their way, they\r\nheard his voice, they listened to him, and the river became something holy\r\nfor them, just like he has for me. Now let us go and take our rest,\r\nSiddhartha.”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha remained with the ferryman and learned how to operate the boat,\r\nand when there was no ferry work to do he would work with Vasudeva in the\r\nrice field, gathering wood, picking the fruits of the plantain trees. He\r\nlearned how to make an oar and how to repair the boat, he learned how to\r\nweave a basket and he was happy at all that he had learned and the days\r\nand the months passed quickly. The river, though, taught him more than\r\nVasudeva was able to. He learned from it without cease. Most of all he\r\nlearned from the river how to listen, to pay attention with a quiet heart,\r\nwith a patient and open soul, without passion, without desire, without\r\njudgement, without opinion.\r\n\r\nHe lived in friendly proximity with Vasudeva, and they would now and then\r\nexchange a few words, a few words which had long been considered. Vasudeva\r\nwas not a friend of words, it was rare for Siddhartha to move him to\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n“Have you,” he once asked him, “have you also learned from the river\r\nthe secret that there is no time?”|\r\n\r\nA bright smile spread over Vasudeva’s face.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Siddhartha,” he said. “Is this what you are saying: that the\r\nriver is the same along his whole length, at his source and at his\r\nestuary, at the waterfall, at the ferry crossing, at the rapids, at the\r\nsea, in the mountains, everywhere the same, and that for him there is only\r\nthe present, no shadow of the future?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that is right,” said Siddhartha. “And when I had learned this\r\nI looked at my life and saw that it too was a river, and separating the\r\nboy Siddhartha from the man Siddhartha, and the man Siddhartha from the\r\nold man Siddhartha, there was merely a shadow, nothing real. And\r\nSiddhartha’s previous births too were not in the past, and his death and\r\nhis return to Brahma were not in the future. Nothing has been and nothing\r\nwill be; everything is, everything has its essence and its presence.”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha spoke with delight, this elucidation had made him deeply happy.\r\nFor was not, then, all suffering time, was not all self-torture and\r\nself-fear time, was not all difficulty, all hostility in the world\r\nexpunged and overcome as soon a time has been overcome, as soon as time\r\ncould be removed from our thoughts? He spoke with gleeful passion, but\r\nVasudeva simple gave him a bright smile and nodded agreement, he nodded in\r\nsilence, touched Siddhartha’s shoulder and went back to his work.\r\n\r\nAnother time in the rainy season, and the swollen river made a mighty\r\nroar, Siddhartha said, “Would you say, my friend, that the river has\r\nmany voices, very many voices? Does he not have the voice of a king, and\r\nof a warrior, and of a bull, and of a bird at night, and of a mother\r\ngiving birth, and of a man who sighs and a thousand other voices?”\r\n\r\n“You are right,” Vasudeva nodded, “all the voices in creation are in\r\nhis voice.”\r\n\r\n“And do you know,” Siddhartha, “what word he says when you succeed\r\nin hearing all ten thousand voices at once?”\r\n\r\nHappy laughter appeared on Vasudeva’s face, he leant towards Siddhartha\r\nand into his ear he spoke the holy word Om. And this indeed was what\r\nSiddhartha also had heard.\r\n\r\nAnd little by little his smile became like the ferryman’s, became nearly\r\nas beaming, nearly as permeated with happiness, just as radiant from a\r\nthousand tiny wrinkles, just as child-like, just as mature. Many\r\ntravellers who saw the two ferrymen thought they must be brothers. In the\r\nevenings they would often sit together on the tree trunk at the riverside,\r\nthey would say nothing but both would listen to the water which, for them,\r\nwas not water but the voice of life, the voice of existence, of eternal\r\nbecoming. Sometimes, as the two of them listened to the river together,\r\nthey would both think of the same things, of a discussion that had taken\r\nplace two days earlier, of one of the travellers whose face and whose\r\ndestiny occupied them, of death, of their childhood. Sometimes, when the\r\nriver had said something good to them, they would each look at the other\r\nat the same moment, both thinking the same thing, both feeling the same\r\njoy at hearing the same answer to the same question.\r\n\r\nMany of the travellers felt there was something given out from the ferry\r\nand the two ferrymen. Sometimes a traveller would look into the face of\r\none of the ferrymen and begin to tell his life story, would tell of his\r\nsorrows, acknowledge where he had done wrong, ask for solace and advice.\r\nSometimes one of them would ask permission to spend the evening with them\r\nto listen to the river. Sometimes someone would come to them because he\r\nwas curious, someone who had heard about these two wise men or magicians\r\nor holy men who lived beside this ferry. They would ask many questions but\r\nreceived no answers, and they found neither magicians nor wise men, all\r\nthey found were two elderly and friendly little men who seemed unable to\r\nspeak and, in some special way, demented. They would laugh, and tell their\r\nfriends about how foolish and credulous those people were who spread such\r\nempty rumours.\r\n\r\nThe years went by and nobody counted them. One time there came monks on a\r\npilgrimage, disciples of Gotama, the buddha, and they asked the ferrymen\r\nto take them across the river, and the ferrymen learned that they were\r\nhurrying back to their great teacher because word was spreading that the\r\nnoble one was mortally ill and must soon suffer his last death as a human\r\nbefore going to his release. Not long after came a new flux of monks on\r\npilgrimage, and then another, and not only the monks but most of the other\r\ntravellers and wanderers spoke of nothing but Gotama and his impending\r\ndeath. There was a flow of people here from all parts as if they had been\r\nan army on campaign or were going to attend the coronation of a king, they\r\ncollected like ants, they flowed as if drawn by some kind of magic on\r\ntheir way to where the great buddha lay awaiting death, to the place where\r\nthat awful event would take place and the great perfect one of an era\r\nwould rise to majesty.\r\n\r\nAt this time Siddhartha thought a great deal about the wise man as he was\r\ndying, about the great teacher whose voice had admonished and who had\r\nbrought hundreds of thousands to an awakening, whose voice he too had\r\nlearned from and whose holy face he too had once looked on with\r\nveneration. He thought of him with kindness, saw his way to perfection\r\nbefore his eyes and, with a smile, thought of the words which he once, as\r\na young man, had put to him, the noble one. Those words now seemed proud\r\nand arrogant to him, and he remembered them with a smile. He had long\r\nknown that there was nothing that made him different from Gotama, though\r\nhe was not able to accept his teachings. No, a true seeker would never be\r\nable to accept any teachings, not if he truly wanted to find what he\r\nsought. But he who has found what he sought would find goodness in any\r\nteachings at all, any path, any objective, he would be in no way different\r\nfrom the thousands of others who lived in eternity, who breathed in the\r\nbreath of the divine.\r\n\r\nOne of those days, when there were so many making pilgrimage to the dying\r\nbuddha, Kamala, who had once been the most beautiful of the courtesans,\r\nalso made pilgrimage to him. She had long since withdrawn from her earlier\r\nway of life, had given her garden to Gotama’s monks, had sought refuge\r\nin his teachings, was one of the friends and benefactors of pilgrims.\r\nTogether with her son, Siddhartha, she had heard news of Gotama’s\r\nimpending death and set out, on foot and in simple clothes, on her way to\r\nhim. She was on her way with her little son along the river: but the lad\r\nsoon became tired, he wanted to go back home, he wanted to rest, he wanted\r\nsomething to eat, he became difficult and whining.\r\n\r\nKamala was frequently obliged to rest with him, he was used to imposing\r\nhis will on her, she had to feed him, had to comfort him, had to\r\ndiscipline him. The boy was unable to understand why he had to go on this\r\nsad and arduous pilgrimage with his mother, to go to a place he did not\r\nknow about, to go to a strange man who was something holy and who lay\r\ndying. So let him die! Why should it matter to him?\r\n\r\nThe pilgrims were not far from Vasudeva’s ferry when young Siddhartha\r\nonce more insisted he and his mother should stop and rest. Kamala, too,\r\nwas tired and while the lad munched on a banana she sank to the ground\r\nand, with eyes half closed, rested. Suddenly though, she gave out a\r\npiercing scream, the boy looked at her in shock and saw her face pale with\r\nhorror as out from her dress emerged a small black snake which had just\r\nbitten her.\r\n\r\nThe two of them now ran along the path to reach people as soon as they\r\ncould and were near the ferry crossing when Kamala collapsed, unable to go\r\nany further. But the lad raised a pitiful cry as he kissed and embraced\r\nhis mother, who added her own voice to the boy’s loud calls for help.\r\nThe sound reached the ears of Vasudeva as he stood by the ferry and he\r\nhurried to Kamala and her son. He took the woman by the arm and carried\r\nher into the boat, the boy also ran in, and they were all soon in the hut\r\nwhere Siddhartha stood at the stove, lighting the fire. He looked up and\r\nsaw, first of all, the face of the boy which reminded him, in a way that\r\nwas both wonderful and reproachful, of something he had forgotten. Then he\r\nsaw Kamala. He recognised her immediately even though she lay unconscious\r\nin the arms of the ferryman, and now he realised that it was the face of\r\nhis own son that had so reproached him, and his heart moved within his\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\nKamala’s wound was washed, but was already black and her body was\r\nswollen, a healing drink was poured into her. Consciousness returned to\r\nher as she lay on Siddhartha’s bed in the hut, Siddhartha leant over\r\nher, he who had once had such earnest love for her. She thought she was\r\ndreaming, and, with a smile, looked into the face of her friend, slowly\r\nbegan to realise where she was, remembered the snake bite, and called out\r\nanxiously for the boy.\r\n\r\n“He is with you. You need not worry,” said Siddhartha.\r\n\r\nKamala looked into his eyes. She spoke with a heavy tongue, made clumsy by\r\nthe venom. “You have grown old, my love,” she said, “you have gone\r\ngrey. But you are just like the young samana who once came to me in the\r\ngarden with no clothes and with dusty feet. You are much more like him\r\nthan you were then for you have gone away from me and Kamaswami. In your\r\neyes you are just like him, Siddhartha. Oh, I too have grown old, old -\r\ndid you still recognise me?”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha smiled. “I recognised you immediately, Kamala, my love.”\r\n\r\nKamala pointed to her boy and said, “Did you recognise him, too? He is\r\nyour son.”\r\n\r\nHer eyes became erratic and fell shut. The boy wept, Siddhartha took him\r\non his knee, let him cry, stroked his hair and, as he looked at the\r\nchild’s face, a brahmanic prayer that he had once learned came to his\r\nmind, one that he had learned when he himself was a lad. Slowly, with\r\nmelodic voice, he began to say it, the words flowed into him from the\r\npast, from his childhood. Affected by his sing-song the boy became quiet,\r\nsobbed now and then, and then fell asleep. Siddhartha put him down on\r\nVasudeva’s bed. Vasudeva stood at the stove cooking rice. Siddhartha\r\nthrew him a glance which he returned with a smile.\r\n\r\n“She’s dying,” said Siddhartha quietly.\r\n\r\nVasudeva nodded, the light of the fire in the stove ran over his friendly\r\nface.\r\n\r\nKamala became conscious once again. Her face was twisted with pain,\r\nSiddhartha’s eye could read the pain on her mouth, on her pale cheeks.\r\nHe read it in silence, watching, waiting, immersed in her suffering.\r\nKamala felt it, her eyes sought his.\r\n\r\nLooking at him, she said, “I can see, now, that your eyes have changed.\r\nThey have become quite different. How is it that I can still see that you\r\nare Siddhartha? You are Siddhartha, yet you are not.”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha said nothing, his eyes looked into hers in silence.\r\n\r\n“Have you achieved it?” she asked. “Have you found peace?”\r\n\r\nHe smiled, and laid his hand on hers.\r\n\r\n“I can see it,” she said, “I can see it. I will find peace too.”\r\n\r\n“You have found peace,” said Siddhartha in a whisper.\r\n\r\nKamala looked steadily into his eyes. She thought of how she had intended\r\nto make pilgrimage to Gotama in order to see the face of a perfect one, in\r\norder to breathe in his peace, and now instead of finding Gotama she had\r\nfound Siddhartha, and it was good so, just as good as if she had seen\r\nGotama. She wanted to tell him so, but her tongue would no longer do as\r\nshe wished. She looked at him in silence, and he saw in her eyes how her\r\nlife was fading. When her final pain filled her eyes, when the final\r\nshudder ran through her limbs, he put his finger to her eyelids and closed\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHe sat there long, looking at her now lifeless face. He looked long at her\r\nmouth, her aged tired mouth with its lips, that now had become thin, and\r\nhe remembered how once, in the springtime of his years, how he had once\r\ncompared this mouth with a freshly opened fig. He sat there long, studied\r\nthat pale face, those tired creases, filled himself with what he saw\r\nthere, saw his own face lying in the same way, just as white, just as\r\nextinguished, simultaneously saw his own face and hers with its red lips,\r\nits burning eyes, and the sense of the present and of simultaneity\r\npermeated his being, the sense of eternity. He felt it deeply, more deeply\r\nthan he had ever felt it before, now in that moment of the immortality of\r\nevery life, the eternity of every glance.\r\n\r\nWhen he raised himself Vasudeva had prepared rice for him. But Siddhartha\r\ndid not eat. In the stall where they kept their goat the two old men\r\nprepared a beds of straw for themselves, and Vasudeva lay down to sleep.\r\nSiddhartha, though, went outside and spent the night sitting in front of\r\nthe hut, listening to the river, the past flowing over him, all the ages\r\nof his life at the same time touching him and embracing him. From time to\r\ntime, though, he would raise himself, go to the door of the hut and listen\r\nto find out whether the boy was sleeping.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning, even before the sun had become visible, Vasudeva\r\ncame out of the stall and went to his friend.\r\n\r\n“You have not slept,” he said.\r\n\r\n“No, Vasudeva. I sat here listening to the river. He told me much, he\r\nfilled me deeply with the healing thought, the thought of unity.”\r\n\r\n“You have gone through pain, Siddhartha, but I can see that there is no\r\nsadness that has entered your heart.”\r\n\r\n“No, my friend, what do I have to be sad about? I used to be rich and\r\nhappy, and now I have become even richer and happier. I have received the\r\ngift of a son.”\r\n\r\n“Your son is also welcome. But now, Siddhartha, let us go to work, there\r\nis much to be done. Kamala died on the same bed as my wife did, long ago.\r\nLet us make her pyre on the same hill where I made hers.”\r\n\r\nThey built her pyre while the boy still slept.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SON\r\n\r\nAt his mother’s funeral the boy was shy and tearful, Siddhartha greeted\r\nhim as his son and told him he was welcome in Vasudeva’s hut and he was\r\nshy and gloomy as he listened. With pale face he sat all day on the hill\r\nof the dead, refused to eat, refused to look, refused to open his heart,\r\nstruggled to defend himself against fate.\r\n\r\nSiddhartha had respect for his grief and did nothing to change his\r\nbehaviour. He understood that his son did not know him and could not love\r\nhim as a father. Slowly, he also saw and understood that the eleven year\r\nold was spoilt, a mummy’s boy, as he grew he had become used to riches\r\nand fancy food, to a soft bed and to giving orders to servants. Siddhartha\r\nunderstood that, spoilt and grieving as the boy was, he would not become\r\ncontent with poverty in a strange place either quickly or with good grace.\r\nHe did not force him, he did many jobs for him, always found the daintiest\r\nfood for him. He hoped he could slowly win him over by friendliness and\r\npatience.\r\n\r\nHe had counted himself rich and happy when the lad came to him. But time\r\nflowed by and the boy continued to be alien and gloomy, he showed a heart\r\nthat was proud and truculent, wanted to do no work, showed no respect for\r\nhis elders, robbed Vasudeva of the fruit on his trees, and so Siddhartha\r\nbegan to understand that it was not peace and happiness that the boy had\r\nbrought with him but sorrow and worries. But Siddhartha loved him, and he\r\npreferred the sorrow and worries of love over the happiness he had enjoyed\r\nwithout the boy. Since the young Siddhartha had been in the hut the two\r\nold men had taken on separate tasks. Vasudeva had once more taken on the\r\noffice of ferryman by himself and, in order to be with his son, it was\r\nSiddhartha who did the work in the hut and the fields.\r\n\r\nSiddhartha waited long, through many months, for his son to understand\r\nhim, for him to accept his love, for him perhaps to return it. Vasudeva\r\nwaited long, while he watched and waited and said nothing. One day though,\r\nwhen the lad had again made his father suffer with his disobedience and\r\nbad humour and had broken both rice dishes, Vasudeva took his friend aside\r\nwhen evening had come and spoke to him.\r\n\r\n“Please forgive me,” he said, “if I say something to you, as I do so\r\nwith a friendly heart. I see that you are suffering, I see that you are\r\nworrying. Your son, my friend, is causing you worries and he is causing me\r\nworries too.”\r\n\r\n“He is used to a different life, he is a young bird used to a different\r\nnest. He did not run away from wealth and the city in weary disgust as you\r\ndid, he was made to leave all this behind him against his will. I have\r\nasked the river, my friend, I have asked him many times. But the river\r\nlaughs at me, he laughs at both of us and shakes his head at our folly.\r\nWater will be water, boys will be boys, your son is not in a place where\r\nhe can flourish. You too should ask the river, you too should listen to\r\nwhat he says!”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha looked anxiously at the friendly face which showed, in the many\r\nwrinkles it bore, that it was the home of constant cheerfulness.\r\n\r\n“Do you think, then, that I would be able to separate myself from\r\nhim?” he said gently, with some shame. “Allow me some time, my friend!\r\nLook, I am struggling for him, I am trying to win his heart, I am trying\r\nto gain it with love and with friendly patience. And one day the river\r\nwill speak also to him, he also has a calling.”\r\n\r\nVasudeva’s smile became warmer. “Oh yes, he also has a calling, he\r\nalso is part of the eternal life. But do we know, you and I, what it is\r\nthat he is called to, what path, what acts, what sufferings? His\r\nsufferings will not be light, he has a heart that is proud and hard, such\r\nas he must suffer greatly, make many mistakes, commit many injustices,\r\nburden themselves with many sins. Tell me, my friend; are you not bringing\r\nyour son up? Do you not compel him to do what he does not want to do? Do\r\nyou not strike him? Do you not punish him?”\r\n\r\n“No, Vasudeva, I do not do any of those things.”\r\n\r\n“I knew it. You do not compel him, you do not strike him, you give him\r\nno orders, because you know that softness is stronger than hardness, water\r\nstronger than stone, love stronger than violence. That is very good, and I\r\npraise you for it. But are you not mistaken in thinking you should not\r\ncompel him, should not punish him? Do you not bind him in the bondage of\r\nyour love? Do you not shame him every day, making it more difficult for\r\nhim with your goodness and patience? Do you not compel this arrogant and\r\nspoilt child to live in a hut with a pair of aged banana eaters for whom\r\neven rice is a luxury, whose thoughts cannot ever be his thoughts, whose\r\nheart is old and quiet and who are following a different path from his? Is\r\nall of this not a compulsion on him, not a punishment?”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha saw that Vasudeva was right and looked down at the ground.\r\nGently he asked him, “What is it you think I should do?”\r\n\r\nVasudeva said, “Take him to the city, take him to his mother’s house,\r\nthe servants will still be there, give him over to them. And if there are\r\nno servants still there then take him to a teacher, not for the sake of\r\nbeing taught but so that he can have the company of other boys, and of\r\ngirls, take him into the world which is his world. Have you never thought\r\nof that?”\r\n\r\n“You have seen into my heart,” said Siddhartha sadly. “I have often\r\nthought of doing that. But listen, how should I put him into this world\r\nwhen he does not have a gentle heart as it is? Will he not become\r\nextravagant, will he not lose himself in the pursuit of fun and of power,\r\nwill he not repeat all the errors of his father, might he not become\r\ntotally lost in sansara?”\r\n\r\nThe ferryman’s smile shone brightly; he gently touched Siddhartha’s\r\narm and said, “Ask the river about it, my friend! Listen to him laughing\r\nabout it! Do you really think that you have gone through these follies of\r\nyours so that your son would not have to? And can you protect your son\r\nfrom sansara? How? By teaching, by prayer, by admonishment? Dear friend,\r\nhave you entirely forgotten that story, that story of the well educated\r\nbrahmin’s son, Siddhartha, that you once told me once on this very spot?\r\nWho was it who held Siddhartha the samana back from sansara, from sin,\r\nfrom greed, from folly? The piety of his father, his teachings and his\r\nwarnings, his own wisdom and his own seekings, were these things able to\r\nkeep Siddhartha safe? What father, what teacher has been able to protect\r\nhim from living his own life, from soiling himself with the dirt of life,\r\nfrom taking guilt onto himself, from taking the bitter drink himself, from\r\nhaving to find his path for himself?\r\n\r\n“Do you really think, my friend, that there is anyone who is spared this\r\npath? Do you think your young son might be spared sorrow and pain and\r\ndisappointed because you love him and you want to save him from those\r\nthings? You could die for him ten times over, but you still would not take\r\neven the tiniest part of his destiny onto yourself.”\r\n\r\nVasudeva had never spoken so many words before. Siddhartha gave him his\r\nfriendly thanks, then, feeling anxious, he went into the hut, but was long\r\nunable to sleep. Vasudeva had said nothing to him that he had not already\r\nthought and known. But it was knowledge that he could not implement, his\r\nlove for the lad was stronger than that knowledge, his affection was\r\nstronger, the fear of losing him was stronger. Had he ever before lost his\r\nheart for anything so completely, had he ever loved anyone this much, so\r\nblindly, so passionately, so hopelessly and yet so happily?\r\n\r\nSiddhartha was not able to follow his friend’s advice, his was not able\r\nto give his son up. He allowed the boy to give him orders, he allowed him\r\nto show him contempt. He remained silent and waited, every day he would\r\nbegin the wordless struggle for friendliness, the soundless war of\r\npatience. Vasudeva, too, remained silent and waited, with friendship, with\r\nunderstanding, with forbearance. Both of them were masters of patience.\r\n\r\nOne time, when the boy’s face reminded him especially of Kamala,\r\nSiddhartha suddenly remembered something that Kamala, long before had said\r\nto him when he was young; she had once said to him, “you are not capable\r\nof love,” and he had conceded that she was right. He had been comparing\r\nhimself with a star, while comparing the childlike people with falling\r\nleaves, but he had nonetheless felt an accusation in every word. It was\r\ntrue that he had never been able to entirely lose himself in another\r\nperson and devote himself to them till he forgot himself, had never\r\nundergone the folly of love for another; he had never been capable of it,\r\nand it had seemed to him then that that was the great difference that\r\ndivided him from the childlike people. But now, since his son had been\r\nthere, even he, Siddhartha, had become entirely childlike, feeling sorrow\r\nfor someone, feeling love for someone, losing himself in love, becoming a\r\nfool for love. It was late, but now even he felt for once in his life this\r\nstrongest and oddest of passions, suffered for it, suffered grievously but\r\nwas nonetheless blessed, nonetheless somewhat rejuvenated, somewhat\r\nwealthier.\r\n\r\nHe was well aware that this love, this blind love for his son, was a\r\npassion, something very human, aware that it was sansara, a cloudy source,\r\na dark water. But he felt at the same time that it was not without value,\r\nthat it was something necessary, that it sprang from its own essence. Even\r\nthis craving had to be paid for, even these pains had to be tasted, even\r\nthese follies had to be gone through.\r\n\r\nDuring all this the son let him go through these follies, let him try to\r\nwin him over, every day he would humiliate him with his moods. This father\r\nof his had nothing that pleased him and nothing that he would be afraid\r\nof. He was a good man, this father, a good, good-natured and gentle man,\r\nperhaps a very pious man, perhaps a holy man - but none of these\r\ncharacteristics were anything that could win the boy over. He found his\r\nfather boring, keeping him prisoner in this miserable hut of his, he was\r\nboring, and every time he behaved badly he would respond with a smile,\r\nrespond to insults with friendliness, respond to malice with goodness.\r\nThis was probably the trick of the old creep that he hated most. The boy\r\nwould rather have had him threaten him and mistreat him.\r\n\r\nThe day came when the young Siddhartha felt it was time to break out, and\r\nhe turned against his father quite openly. Siddhartha had given him the\r\ntask of collecting firewood, but the boy did not leave the hut, he stood\r\nthere in angry defiance, stamped his foot, clenched his fists and burst\r\nout in a fit, screaming hatred and contempt in his father’s face.\r\n\r\n“Get the firewood yourself!” he shouted, frothing at the mouth,\r\n“I’m not your servant. I’m well aware you never hit me, ‘cause you\r\ndon’t dare to; I’m well aware you want to punish me a make me small\r\nwith your God-fearingness and your softness. You want me to be just like\r\nyou, all pious and all gentle and all full of wisdom! But listen! I’m\r\ngoing to make you sorry, I’d rather be a bandit on the roads, rather be\r\na murderer and go to Hell than be like you! I hate you, you’re not my\r\nfather even if you’d been my mother’s lover ten times over!”\r\n\r\nHe gushed over with anger and self-pity, spat a hundred vapid and spiteful\r\nwords out at his father. Then the boy ran off and did not come back until\r\nlate in the evening.\r\n\r\nBut by the following morning he had disappeared. The little basket, woven\r\nof fibres in two colours in which the ferrymen kept all the copper or\r\nsilvers coins they received as passengers’ fares, was also missing. Also\r\ntheir boat was missing, which Siddhartha saw lying at the other side of\r\nriver. The boy had run away.\r\n\r\n“I will have to go after him,” said Siddhartha, who was still shaken\r\nfrom the previous day’s tirade by the boy. “A child cannot go through\r\nthe forest by himself. He will be killed. We need to build a raft,\r\nVasudeva, to get across the water.”\r\n\r\n“We will build a raft,” said Vasudeva, “to fetch back our boat that\r\nthe lad took away. But you should let him go, my friend, he is not a child\r\nany more, he knows how to look after himself. He is looking for the way to\r\nthe city, and he is right, do not forget that. He is doing what you have\r\nfailed to do yourself. He is looking after himself, he is following his\r\nown path. Oh Siddhartha, I can see that you are suffering, but the pains\r\nyou are suffering are pains that could be laughed about, pains that you\r\ntoo will soon laugh about.”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha gave no answer. He already held the chopper in his hand and had\r\nbegun to build the raft from bamboo wood. Vasudeva helped him to tie them\r\ntogether with rope made of grass. Then they made the crossing, were\r\ncarried far off course and, on the opposite shore, pulled the raft back\r\nupstream.\r\n\r\n“Why have you brought the chopper with you?” asked Siddhartha.\r\n\r\nVasudeva answered, “It could be that the rudder of our boat will be\r\nmissing.”\r\n\r\nBut Siddhartha knew what his friend was thinking. He was thinking that the\r\nboy will have thrown the rudder away or smashed it in order to take his\r\nrevenge and to make it harder to follow him. And the rudder was indeed no\r\nlonger in the boat. Vasudeva pointed to the floor of the boat and looked\r\nat his friend with a smile, as if he meant to say, “Do you not see what\r\nit is that your son wants to tell you? Do you not see that he does not\r\nwant to be pursued?” He did not, however, say this in words. He set\r\nabout making a new rudder, but Siddhartha took his leave and went to\r\nsearch for the fugitive. Vasudeva did nothing to stop him.\r\n\r\nSiddhartha had long been making his way through the forest before it\r\noccurred to him that his search was pointless. On the one hand, he\r\nthought, the boy might be a long way ahead of him and had already reached\r\nthe city or, on the other, if he was still on his journey he would hide\r\nhimself from his pursuer. He continued to think about this, and he found\r\nthat he was not himself worried about his son for, deep within himself, he\r\nknew he had neither been killed nor faced any danger in the woods.\r\nSiddhartha nonetheless hurried on without rest, no longer in order to save\r\nhis son but just because there was something he wanted, just in order to\r\nhave the chance of seeing him again. He continued to hurry forward until\r\nhe was at the outskirts of the city.\r\n\r\nNear by the city, on the broad highway, he reached the entrance to the\r\nbeautiful pleasure garden which had once belonged to Kamala, where he had\r\nseen her for the first time carried on her litter, and there he stopped.\r\nThe memory rose up in his soul and he once more saw himself standing\r\nthere, a young and naked samana, bearded and with hair full of dust.\r\nSiddhartha stood there long, looking in through the open gate into the\r\ngarden where monks in yellow robes walked about under the beautiful trees.\r\n\r\nHe stood there long, thinking, seeing pictures, listening to the story of\r\nhis life. He stood there long, watching the monks, and instead of seeing\r\nthem he saw the young Siddhartha, saw the young Kamala as she moved about\r\nunder the lofty trees. He saw himself clearly, how Kamala made him her\r\nguest, how he accepted her first kiss, the pride and contempt he felt as\r\nhe looked back on his life as a brahmin, the pride and greed with which he\r\nbegan his secular life. He saw Kamaswami, saw the servants, saw the wild\r\nparties, the gamblers with their dice, the musicians, he saw Kamala’s\r\nsongbird in its cage, he lived through all this once again, he breathed\r\nsansara, he was once again old and tired, felt once again the wish to\r\nextinguish himself, was healed once again by the holy Om.\r\n\r\nHe stood long at the gateway into the garden until he saw that it was a\r\nfoolish wish that had driven him to this place, that he was unable to help\r\nhis son, that he should not stay too attached to him. He felt his love for\r\nthe fugitive deep in his heart, like a wound, and at the same time he saw\r\nthat the wound had not been given to him for him to dig at it, but that it\r\nwould blossom and had to shine.\r\n\r\nIt made him sad that by this time the wound still had not blossomed, still\r\ndid not shine. Instead of having an objective for his wishes, the\r\nobjective that had drawn him to this place in pursuit of his runaway son,\r\nhe now had nothing. Disheartened, he sat down, felt something die within\r\nhis heart, felt the emptiness, saw nothing to bring him joy, nothing to be\r\nhis objective. He sat there deep in thought and waited. This was what he\r\nhad learned at the riverside, just this: to wait, to be patient, to\r\nlisten. And he sat and listened, in the dust of the road, he listened to\r\nhis sad and tired heart, he waited for a voice. He remained there for many\r\nhours, crouched and listening, he saw no more pictures, he sank into\r\nemptiness, allowed himself to sink, and saw no path to follow. And when he\r\nfelt the wound burning he would silently utter Om, would fill himself with\r\nOm. The monks in the garden saw him, for he crouched there for many hours,\r\nand on his grey hair the dust accumulated, one of them came to him and put\r\ntwo bananas down in front of him. The old man did not see him.\r\n\r\nHe was woken from this stupor by a hand shaking his shoulder. He\r\nrecognised this gentle and tentative movement straight away, and came out\r\nof his state. He stood up and greeted Vasudeva who had come after him. And\r\nas he looked into Vasudeva’s friendly face, into those cheerful little\r\neyes surrounded by many laughter wrinkles, he smiled too. Now he saw the\r\nbananas lying in front of him, lifted them up, gave one to the ferryman\r\nand ate the other one himself. Then he and Vasudeva went in silence back\r\ninto the wood and back to their home at the ferry point. Neither spoke of\r\nwhat had happened that day, neither spoke the name of the lad, neither\r\nspoke of his flight, neither spoke of the wound. In the hut Siddhartha lay\r\ndown on his bed and a little while later, when Vasudeva came to him to\r\noffer him a cup of coconut milk, he found he was already asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nOM\r\n\r\nThe wound continued to cause pain. Siddhartha had to take many travellers\r\nacross the river who had a son or a daughter with them, and there was not\r\none of them whom Siddhartha did not look on with envy, and he would think,\r\n“There are so many, so many thousands, who have this noblest of\r\nhappiness - why do I not? Even evil people, even thieves and robbers have\r\nchildren whom they love and who are loved by them, and I alone do not\r\nhave.” This was the simplicity of his thoughts at that time, so lacking\r\nin understanding, so similar had he become to the child-like people.\r\n\r\nHe no longer looked on people in the way he had done, less clever, less\r\nproud, but with more warmth, more curiosity, more concerned. When he\r\ncarried people who were normal - child-people, businessmen, soldiers,\r\nwomen - these people did not seem as alien to him as they had done\r\npreviously: he understood them, he shared the life they led, a life which\r\nwas not directed by thoughts and insights but solely by drives and wishes,\r\nhe felt he was the same as they were. He was now near liberation, though\r\nhe still suffered from the wound which was still fresh. These people\r\nseemed to him nonetheless to be his brothers, these childlike people, with\r\nall their vanities, their greed and their ridiculousness, no longer seemed\r\nridiculous, they had become understandable, become deserving of love,\r\neven, it seemed to him, become venerable. The blind love of a mother for\r\nher child, the stupid blind pride of an over-proud father for his only\r\nlittle son, the vanity of a young woman who has a blind wild wish for more\r\njewelry and for admiration in the eyes of men, all these drives, all this\r\nchildishness, all these simple drives and greeds which were so foolish but\r\nso monstrously strong, strong for life, strong enough to make themselves\r\nfelt. For Siddhartha now, these drives and greeds were no longer childish,\r\nhe saw how they gave people life, he saw how people could achieve the\r\ninfinite, how they could go on journeys, wage war, bear infinite sorrows,\r\nand he was able to love them for it, he saw life, he saw the living, he\r\nsaw the indestructible, he saw Brahman in all their sorrows and all their\r\nactions. These people had a faith that was blind, blind was their strength\r\nand their tenderness, and that made them deserving of both love and of\r\nadmiration. There was nothing they lacked, there was no way that the wise\r\nman, the thinking man, was ahead of them except for one detail, one single\r\ntiny detail: consciousness, conscious awareness of the unity of all life.\r\nAnd Siddhartha was often in doubt as to whether he should value this\r\nknowledge, these thoughts, so highly, whether he would not also like to be\r\nas childlike as the thought-people the childlike thought-people. In all\r\nother respects the people of the world were the equals of the wise, in\r\nmany respects far superior, just like animals that do what they have to do\r\nwith harshness and without error, animals that can seem at many times\r\nsuperior to man.\r\n\r\nThe realisation, the knowledge of what wisdom actually is, and of what it\r\nwas that he had been seeking for so long, was slow to blossom, slow to\r\nripen in Siddhartha. It was nothing more than the readiness of the soul, a\r\ncapability, a secret talent, to think the thought of the one at every\r\nmoment, in the middle of life to feel the one, the ability to breathe the\r\none. This was slow to blossom in him, it shone on him back from the\r\nchild-like face of Vasudeva: harmony, knowledge of eternal perfection, the\r\nworld, a smile, the one.\r\n\r\nThe wound, however, still burned. Siddhartha yearned bitterly for his son,\r\nhe nurtured his love and tenderness in his heart, he allowed the pain to\r\nconsume him, he went through all the follies of love. This was a flame\r\nthat would not die away by itself.\r\n\r\nOne day, when the wound was burning fiercely, Siddhartha, impelled by the\r\nyearning for his son, crossed the river, disembarked and wanted to go to\r\nthe city to seek him out. The river flowed with gentle smoothness, it was\r\nthe dry time of year, but his voice sounded odd: it was the voice of\r\nlaughter. It was clearly the voice of laughter. The river was laughing,\r\nlaughing brightly and clearly at the aged ferryman. Siddhartha stopped and\r\nbent towards the water in order to hear it better, and in the smoothly\r\nflowing water he saw the reflection of his own face, and this reflection\r\nseemed to remind him of something, something forgotten, and as he thought\r\nabout it he found it: this face was the same as another face he had once\r\nknown and loved and feared. It was the same face as his father’s, the\r\nface of the brahmin. And he remembered how, long ago as a young man, he\r\nhad forced his father to let him go and join the penitents, how he had\r\ntaken his leave of him, how he had left and never gone back. Had his\r\nfather not suffered the same grief as he now suffered for his own son? Was\r\nhis father not now long dead, dying alone without ever having seen his son\r\nagain? Would he not now have to expect the same fate for himself? Was it\r\nnot a comedy, something peculiar and stupid, this repetition, this running\r\nround in circles that would lead only to his fate.\r\n\r\nThe river was laughing. It was true, everything came back to you that had\r\nnot been endured to the end and resolved, the same pains would be suffered\r\nagain and again. But Siddhartha got back into the boat and went back to\r\nthe hut, thinking of his father, thinking of his son, laughed at by the\r\nriver, in dispute with himself, inclined to doubt and no less inclined to\r\njoin in with the laughter at himself and at the whole world. But the wound\r\nhad still not matured into blossom, his heart still struggled against his\r\nfate, there was still no merriment, no victory, shining from his\r\nsuffering. He nonetheless felt hope, and when he had arrived back at the\r\nhut he felt a wish that he could not overcome to open himself to Vasudeva,\r\nto show him all, him the master of listening, to tell him everything.\r\n\r\nVasudeva sat in the hut weaving a basket. He no longer went out on the\r\nboat, his eyes were becoming weak, and not only his eyes; his arms and his\r\nhands were becoming weak too. It was only his joy and the cheerful\r\nbenevolence shown in his face that remained unchanged and flourishing.\r\n\r\nSiddhartha sat down by the old man and slowly began to speak. He told him\r\nof things they had never before discussed, of his journey to the city, of\r\nhis burning wound, of his envy when he saw a happy father, of his\r\nawareness of the folly of such wishes and his unsuccessful struggle\r\nagainst them. He told him all, he was able to tell him all, even the most\r\npainful, all could be said, all could be shown, all could he relate. He\r\ndisplayed his wound to him, even told him of his attempt to flee that very\r\nday, how he had crossed the river, fleeing like a child and wishing to\r\nwalk to the city, how the river had laughed at him.\r\n\r\nHe spoke long, Vasudeva listened with a quiet expression on his face,\r\nSiddhartha felt that Vasudeva listened more closely than he ever had\r\nbefore, he felt how his pain, his anxieties flowed over to him, how his\r\nsecret hopes flowed over to him, how he came across to meet him. To tell\r\nthis listener about his wounds was the same a bathing them in the river\r\ntill they became cool and became one with the river. As he continued to\r\nspeak, continued to acknowledge his faults, continued to make his\r\nconfession, Siddhartha felt more and more that this was no longer\r\nVasudeva, no longer a human being, that was listening to him, that\r\nVasudeva as he sat motionless and listening was drawing in his confession\r\nlike a tree draws up rainwater, that Vasudeva as he sat motionless was the\r\nriver himself, that he was God himself, that he was the eternal himself.\r\nAnd as Siddhartha ceased thinking about himself and his wounds awareness\r\nof Vasudeva’s changed nature took possession of him, the more he\r\nreceived it and penetrated it, the less wonderful it became and he saw\r\nthat all was as it should be, all was natural, he saw that Vasudeva had\r\nlong been in this state, he had almost always been in this state, he saw\r\nthat only he had not quite understood this, he saw that he himself was\r\nhardly separate from him. He perceived that he now saw the aged Vasudeva\r\nin the way that people see the gods, and that this was not something that\r\ncould last; he began, in his heart, to take his leave of Vasudeva. And as\r\nhe saw these things he continued to speak.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finally finished speaking Vasudeva raised his eyes, friendly\r\nbut grown somewhat weak, to Siddhartha. He said nothing, but in silence he\r\nremained cheerful and shone his love, his understanding, and his wisdom\r\nonto him. He took Siddhartha’s hand, led him out to their seat at the\r\nriverside, sat down with him, and smiled down at the water.\r\n\r\n“You heard him laughing,” he said. “But you did not hear everything.\r\nLet us listen, you will hear more.”\r\n\r\nThey listened. The song of the river, sung in his many voices, was sweet.\r\nSiddhartha looked into the water, pictures appeared to him in the water as\r\nit flowed: his father appeared to him, alone and in mourning for his son;\r\nhe appeared to himself, alone and he, too, was bound in the fetters of\r\nlonging for his son; his son appeared to him, also alone, as the lad\r\nhurried greedily along the burning road of his youthful desire. Each of\r\nthem was directed to his aim, each of them obsessed with his aim, each of\r\nthem suffering. The river sang with a voice of sorrow, with yearning it\r\nsang, with yearning it flowed towards its aim, its voice was one of\r\nlament.\r\n\r\nWithout speaking, Vasudeva looked at Siddhartha, and his look asked, “Do\r\nyou hear?” Siddhartha nodded.\r\n\r\n“Hear better,” Vasudeva whispered.\r\n\r\nSiddhartha strained to hear better. The image of his father, the image of\r\nhimself, the image of his son flowed in and out of each other, the image\r\nof Kamala also appeared and flowed away, the image of Govinda and other\r\nimages appeared, flowed in and out of each other, each became a part of\r\nthe river, each of them, as a part of the river, strove to reach its aim,\r\nyearning, greedy, suffering, and the voice of the river was full of\r\nyearning, full of burning pain, full of insatiable desire. The river\r\nstrove to reach its aim, Siddhartha saw it rushing, the river that was\r\nmade up of him and of those who belonged to him and all the people he had\r\never seen, all the waves and all the water rushed in sorrow to their aim,\r\nto their many aims, to the waterfall, to the lake, to the rapids, to the\r\nsea, and all the aims were achieved, and each one was followed by another,\r\nand water became steam and rose up to the sky, it became rain and poured\r\nfrom the sky, it became a spring, became a stream, became a river,\r\nstriving for the new, flowing into the new. But the voice of yearning had\r\nchanged. It could still be heard, full of sorrow, full of searching, but\r\nother voices came to keep it company, voices of joy and of sorrow, good\r\nvoices and bad voices, laughing and mourning, a hundred voices, a thousand\r\nvoices.\r\n\r\nSiddhartha listened. By now he was nothing but listener, engrossed in\r\nlistening, quite empty, sucking in, he felt he had now fully learned how\r\nto listen. He had heard all these things many times before, all these\r\nvoices in the river, but today it sounded new. He could no longer\r\ndistinguish these countless voices, not the gay from the plangent, not the\r\nchildish from the manly, they all belonged together, lamentations of\r\nyearning, laughter of the wise man, the shout of anger and the groans of\r\nthe dying, all was as one, all was interwoven and conjoined, interwoven in\r\na thousand places. And all of this together, all the voices, all the aims,\r\nall the yearning, all the sorrows, all the joys, all the good and all the\r\nbad, all of this together was the world. All of this together was the\r\nevents that happened, flowing like the river, all of this was the music of\r\nlife. And when Siddhartha listened carefully to this flow, to this river\r\nwith its thousand voices, when he listened not to the sorrow or the\r\nlaughter, when he bound his soul not with any one of those voices and went\r\ninto it with his Self, but when he heard everything, the whole, when he\r\nperceived the unity of the whole, that was when the great song of a\r\nthousand voices was made up of a single word, the word Om: Perfection.\r\n\r\nOnce more, Vasudeva’s glance asked, “Do you hear?”\r\n\r\nVasudeva’s smile shone brightly, all round Vasudeva’s face with all\r\nits wrinkles there was a glow of brightness, just as, over and around all\r\nthe voices of the river, there was the Om. His smile shone brightly as he\r\nlooked at his friend, also now, on Siddhartha’s face, the same smile\r\nbegan to glow brightly. His wounds blossomed, his sorrow glowed, his Self\r\nhad flowed into the unity.\r\n\r\nIt was at that moment that Siddhartha stopped struggling against his fate,\r\nstopped suffering. On his face there blossomed the gaiety of knowledge\r\nwhen there is no longer any will standing against it, the knowledge known\r\nby liberation, the knowledge that is in agreement with the flow of events,\r\nwith the river of life with all its shared sorrows, with all its shared\r\njoys, surrendering to the flow, belonging to the unity.\r\n\r\nVasudeva stood up from where he had been sitting on the bank of the river,\r\nhe looked in Siddhartha’s eyes and saw the gaiety of wisdom shining\r\nthere, he put his hand lightly in his careful and gentle way on\r\nSiddhartha’s shoulder and he said, “I have been waiting for this\r\nmoment, my friend. Now that it has come let me take my leave of you. I\r\nhave been waiting long for this moment, long have I been Vasudeva the\r\nferryman. It is now enough. Farewell hut, farewell river, farewell\r\nSiddhartha!”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha bowed deeply to Vasudeva as he took his leave.\r\n\r\n“I knew it,” he said gently. “Will you go into the woods?”\r\n\r\nVasudeva’s face shone, and he said, “I will go into the woods, I will\r\ngo into the unity.”\r\n\r\nStill beaming he went on his way; Siddhartha watched him as he went. With\r\nthe deepest joy, with the deepest earnestness, he watched him as he went,\r\nsaw his steps full of contentment, saw his head as it shone, saw his shape\r\nfull of light.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVINDA\r\n\r\nGovinda was spending a rest period with other monks in the pleasure garden\r\nwhich the courtesan, Kamala, had given to the followers of Gotama. He\r\nheard there about an aged ferryman who lived by a river about a day’s\r\njourney away, and whom many regarded as a wise man. When Govinda resumed\r\nhis walking he chose to take the path to the ferry, curious to see who\r\nthis ferryman was. All through his life he had lived according to the\r\nregimen of his order, and the younger monks regarded him with veneration\r\nbecause of his age and his modesty, but there was still unrest in his\r\nheart and a searching which had not been extinguished.\r\n\r\nHe arrived at the river and asked the old man to take him across. On the\r\nother bank, as they stepped out of the boat, he said to the old man,\r\n“You have been very good to us monks and pilgrims, and you have taken\r\nmany of us across the river. Could it be that you too, ferryman, are a\r\nseeker of the right path?”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha showed a smile in his aging eyes and said, “Do you call\r\nyourself a seeker, venerable sir, when you are already advanced in years\r\nand you wear the robes of a monk of Gotama?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I am old,” said Govinda, “but I have never stopped searching.\r\nI never will stop searching, this seems to be my destiny. And it seems to\r\nme that you, too, have been seeking. Would you like to say a word to me,\r\nhonoured one?”\r\n\r\n“What might I want to say to you, venerable sir?” Siddhartha asked.\r\n“Perhaps I should ask you if you are not seeking too hard. Or ask if it\r\nis your seeking that prevents you from finding.”\r\n\r\n“How do you mean that?” Govinda asked.\r\n\r\n“When someone is seeking,” said Siddhartha, “it is very easy for his\r\neye to see nothing but the thing sought, that he is unable to find, unable\r\nto receive into himself anything because he thinks only of that which he\r\nseeks, because he has an objective, because he is obsessed with that\r\nobjective. Seeking means having an objective, but finding means being\r\nfree, being receptive, having no objective. It could be, venerable sir,\r\nthat you are indeed a seeker, for in your efforts to reach your objective\r\nyou fail to see many things that are close before your eyes.”\r\n\r\n“I still do not quite understand,” Govinda asked, “how do you mean\r\nthat?”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha said, “Once before, venerable sir, many years ago, you were\r\nbeside this river, and you found there a man who was sleeping, and you sat\r\ndown beside him to watch over him as he slept. But, Govinda, you did not\r\nrecognise this sleeper.”\r\n\r\nAstonished as if bewitched, the monk looked into the ferryman’s eyes.\r\n\r\n“You are Siddhartha?” he asked, in timid voice. “Again, I failed to\r\nrecognise you! Hearty greetings, Siddhartha, I am heartily glad to see you\r\nagain! You have changed so much, my friend - and now, you have become a\r\nferryman?”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha gave a friendly laugh. “Yes, Govinda, a ferryman. There are\r\nmany who have to go through many changes, have to wear many different\r\nclothes, and I am one of them, my friend. Welcome Govinda! Come and stay\r\nthe night in my hut.”\r\n\r\nGovinda did stay the night in the hut and he slept in the place which had\r\nformerly been Vasudeva’s bed. He had many questions to put to his\r\nchildhood friend, Siddhartha had to recount many episodes of his life to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe following morning came and it was time for Govinda to resume his\r\nwandering. Govinda said, with some hesitation, “Before I continue my\r\njourney, Siddhartha, let me ask you one more thing. Do you have a\r\ndoctrine? Do you have a belief or a knowledge that you follow and which\r\nhelps you through life and to do the right thing?”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha said, “My friend, you know that when I was a young man,\r\nliving with you and the other penitents in the woods, that I had already\r\nbegun to mistrust doctrines and their teachers, and so I turned my back on\r\nthem. I have not changed my view. I have nonetheless had many teachers\r\nsince that time. There was a beautiful courtesan who was my teacher for a\r\nlong time, and a rich businessman was my teacher, as well as several\r\ngamblers. One time there was even a wandering disciple of the Buddha who\r\nwas my teacher; he was on pilgrimage but he sat beside me while I was\r\nasleep in the woods. I learned from him too, and I am grateful to him too,\r\nvery grateful. But most of all, I have learned from the river here, and\r\nfrom my predecessor, Vasudeva the ferryman. He was a very simple man,\r\nVasudeva, he was not a thinker but he knew the important things as well as\r\nGotama, he was a perfect man, he was a holy man.”\r\n\r\n“I think you’re mocking me again, Siddhartha,” said Govinda. “I\r\nbelieve you and I both know that you have never followed any teacher. But\r\neven if you have never followed a teacher have you not had certain\r\nthoughts, found certain kinds of knowledge yourself, knowledge which is\r\nyour own and which have helped you through life? If you would like to tell\r\nme something of this it would bring joy to my heart.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Siddhartha, “there are some things that I have thought\r\nfrom time to time, and some things that I have seen. There have been times\r\nwhen, for one hour or for one day, I have felt there is knowledge within\r\nme, just as it is possible to feel life in one’s heart. I have had many\r\nsuch thoughts, but I would find it very hard to tell you about them.\r\nGovinda, listen, here is one of the thoughts that I have found: wisdom\r\ncannot be taught. If a wise man tries to teach wisdom it will always sound\r\nlike folly.”\r\n\r\n“Are you joking now?” Govinda asked.\r\n\r\n“I am not joking. I am saying what I have found. Knowledge can be\r\ntaught, but not wisdom. It can be found, it can be lived, it can be what\r\ncarries you, it can work wonders, but it cannot be spoken and it cannot be\r\ntaught. This is what I had already begun to suspect when I was young, this\r\nis what drove me away from the teachers. I have found a thought, Govinda,\r\na thought that you will again suppose is folly or a joke, but it is the\r\nbest thought I have. It reads: For every truth, the opposite is equally\r\ntrue! This means that a truth that is one-sided can only ever be spoken,\r\nit is encased in words. All that is thought with thoughts and can be\r\nspoken in words will be one-sided, all will be half, all will be lacking\r\nin wholeness, in roundness, in unity. When the noble Gotama spoke of the\r\nworld in his teachings he had to divide it into sansara and nirvana, into\r\ndelusion and truth, into suffering and liberation. He who wishes to be a\r\nteacher has no choice in the matter, there is no other path for him to\r\nfollow. The world itself, though, that which exists around us and within\r\nus, is never one sided. It is never a person, never an act, never the\r\nwhole of sansara and never the whole of nirvana, and a person is never\r\nentirely holy and never entirely sinful. It does seem so because we are\r\nsubjected to delusion and believe that time is something real. Time is not\r\nreal, Govinda, that is something I have experienced many times. And if\r\ntime is not real then the gap that seems to lie between the world and\r\neternity, between suffering and being blessed, between evil and good, is\r\nalso just delusion.”\r\n\r\n“How do you mean that?” asked Govinda, with some anxiety.\r\n\r\n“Listen, my friend, listen well. The sinner, such as me, such as you, is\r\na sinner, but he will one day become once more Brahma, he will one day\r\nachieve nirvana, will become a buddha - but now think of this: this ‘one\r\nday’ is delusion, it is only a comparison! The sinner is not on his way\r\nto becoming a buddha, he is not engrossed in any kind of development, even\r\nthough it is not possible for our thought to imagine these things in any\r\nother way. No, the prospective buddha is already within the sinner, now\r\nand today, his future is all already there, within him, within you, within\r\neveryone is that which will be, that which is possible, that which is the\r\nhidden buddha to be honoured. The world, Govinda my friend, is not\r\nimperfect, nor is it trapped on a weary road to perfection: no, it has\r\nperfection in every glance of the eye, every sin contains mercy within it,\r\nevery little child has the old man within it, every suckling has death\r\nwithin it, every dying man has eternal life within him. No man is able to\r\nsee how far he has progressed along his path by looking at others, within\r\nthe thief and within the gambler the buddha is waiting, within the brahmin\r\nthe thief is waiting. In deep meditation it is possible to remove time and\r\nto see all that has been, all that is and all that will be in one moment,\r\nand in that moment all is good, all is perfect, all is Brahman. That is\r\nwhy it appears to me that all that is good, death appears to me as the\r\nsame as life, sin appears to me the same as holiness, wisdom appears to me\r\nthe same as folly, everything has to be thus, nothing needs anything more\r\nthan my agreement, more than my will, my loving involvement, and so, for\r\nme, it is good, it can only advance me and can never harm me. I have\r\nlearned through experience that I needed to sin, body and soul, I needed\r\nlust, I strove for more possessions, I was vain, and I needed only the\r\nslightest doubt to teach me to give up struggling against these things, to\r\nlearn to love the world, to stop comparing it with any kind of imaginary\r\nworld I might have wished for or any kind of perfection I might have\r\ninvented, I learned to leave the world as it is and to love it and to\r\nenjoy being a part of it. These, Govinda, are some of the thoughts that\r\nhave come into my mind.”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha reached down and picked up a stone from the ground, then he\r\nweighed it in his hand. “This,” he said playfully, “is a stone, and\r\nafter a certain time it might become soil, and then the soil might become\r\na plant or an animal or a person. But earlier I would have said: this\r\nstone is just a stone, it is worthless, it belongs to the world of maya;\r\nbut through the circle of metamorphoses it might become a person or a\r\nspirit, and that is why I attribute value to it. That is what I might have\r\nthought earlier. But now I think: this stone is a stone, it is also an\r\nanimal, it is also a god, it is also a buddha, I do not venerate it, I do\r\nnot love it because it might one day become this or that but because it\r\nhas always been everything and always will be - and that is exactly why I\r\nlove it, for being a stone, because it appears to me as a stone and always\r\nwill do, that is why I see value and meaning in each of its veins and each\r\nof its hollows, in the yellow, in the grey, in its hardness, in the sound\r\nit makes when I tap it, in the dryness or the wetness of its surface.\r\nThere are some stones that feel like oil or soap, others feel like leaves,\r\nothers like sand, and each of them is unique and each of them prays to Om\r\nin its own way, each of them is Brahman but at the same time each of them\r\nis a stone, all the more is it a stone, it is oily or juicy, and that is\r\nwhat appeals to me, that is what seems so wonderful to me and so worthy of\r\nworship. But do not let continue talking about this. Words are not good\r\nfor the invisible spirit, it always instantly becomes a little different\r\nwhen spoken about, a little false, a little foolish - and even that is\r\nsomething very good and something I like very much, something I fully\r\nconsent to, that which one man sees as valuable wisdom will always seem to\r\nanother to be folly.”\r\n\r\nGovinda listened in silence.\r\n\r\nAfter a pause he asked, hesitantly, “Why did you tell me all that about\r\nthe stone?”\r\n\r\n“It just happened. I did not plan it. Or perhaps I meant to say that I\r\nlove this stone, and the river, and all these things we think about and\r\nfrom which we can learn. I am capable of loving a stone, Govinda, and also\r\na tree or a piece of bark. Those are things, and it is possible to love\r\nthings. But it is not possible to love words. That is why teachings are\r\nnot for me, they have no hardness, no softness, no colours, no edges, no\r\nsmell, no taste, they have nothing but words. Maybe that is what is\r\npreventing you from finding peace, maybe it is all those words. As even\r\nredemption and virtue, even sansara and nirvana are nothing but words,\r\nGovinda. There is nothing for nirvana to be; there is only the word,\r\n‘nirvana’.”\r\n\r\nGovinda said, “Nirvana is not merely a word, my friend. It is a\r\nthought.”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha continued, “A thought, maybe it is. I have to admit, my\r\nfriend, I do not make any great distinction between thoughts and words. To\r\nput it simply, I do not have much respect for thoughts. I have more\r\nrespect for things. There was a man here on this ferryboat, for example,\r\nwho was my predecessor and my teacher, a holy man who, for many years,\r\nbelieved simply in the river, and nothing else. He had noticed that the\r\nriver’s voice spoke to him and he learned from it, it brought him up, it\r\nhelped him to develop, it taught him. The river seemed to him like a god,\r\nfor many years he did not know that every wind, every cloud, every bird,\r\nevery beetle is just as god-like as the river he venerated so much, and\r\nknew just as much, and had just as much to teach him. By the time this\r\nholy man went off into the woods he knew everything, he knew more than you\r\nand I, without a teacher, without books, and only because he believed in\r\nthe river.”\r\n\r\nGovinda said, “And is that what you mean by ‘things,’ something\r\nreal, something that exists? Is that not just the delusion of maya, just a\r\npicture, just an appearance? This stone of yours, this tree, this river,\r\nare they then reality?”\r\n\r\n“Even this question,” said Siddhartha, “no longer gives me much\r\nbother. Perhaps these things are delusory and perhaps they are not, but\r\nthen I too am an illusion and so they continue to be the same as me. That\r\nis what makes them so dear and so venerable for me: they are the same as\r\nme. That is why I can love them. And now, here is a teaching that will\r\nmake you laugh: it seems to me, Govinda, that love is the most important\r\nthing of all. Perhaps seeing through the world, explaining the world,\r\ndespising the world, is an important matter for the great thinkers, but\r\nonly one thing is important for me, the ability to love the world, not to\r\ndespise it, not to hate it or myself, but the ability to see it and myself\r\nand all that exists with love and admiration and honour.”\r\n\r\n“I can understand that,” said Govinda. “But this, too, is something\r\nthat the noble one has recognised as delusion. He instructs us to show\r\nbenevolence, mercy, compassion, patience, but not love; he has forbidden\r\nus to tether our hearts to the world with love.”\r\n\r\n“I know it well,” said Siddhartha, and his face shone with smile of\r\ngold. “I know it well, Govinda. But now look; we find ourselves now in\r\nthe middle of a thicket of meanings, we’re quibbling about words. I\r\ncannot deny that my words about love contradict - or seem to contradict -\r\nthe words of Gotama. And that is the very reason I mistrust words so much,\r\nI know that this contradiction is delusory. I know that I agree with\r\nGotama. For how could it be that he knew nothing of love, even he who\r\nacknowledged the transitoriness of all human existence, acknowledged it in\r\nall its nothingness, but nonetheless loved mankind so much that he devoted\r\nhis long and strenuous life to one thing, to help them and to teach them!\r\nAnd even the things about him, about your great teacher are more important\r\nfor me than his words, his actions and his life are more important than\r\nwhat he said, the movements of his hand are more important than his\r\nbeliefs. I don’t see his greatness in what he said or what he thought, I\r\nsee it only in his actions, in his life.”\r\n\r\nFor a long while the two old men remained silent. Then Govinda began to\r\ntake his leave of Siddhartha, saying, “Thank you for showing me\r\nsomething of your thoughts, Siddhartha. Some of them are odd, and I am not\r\nable to understand them all straight away. Be that as it may, I give you\r\nmy thanks and wish you peaceful days.”\r\n\r\n(Privately, though, Govinda thought to himself, “This Siddhartha is a\r\nwonderful man, these are wonderful thoughts he expresses, his teaching\r\nsounds foolish. The pure teachings of the noble one are different, they\r\nare clearer, purer, easier to understand, and contain nothing odd or\r\nfoolish or ridiculous. But Siddhartha’s hands and feet seem different\r\nfrom his thoughts. His eyes, his brow, his breath, his smile, his\r\ngreeting, his walk, they all seem different. Since our noble one, Gotama,\r\nwent into Nirvana I have never met any one about whom I have felt, ‘This\r\nis a holy man.’ He alone, this Siddhartha, is the only one I have found.\r\nHis teachings may sound odd, his words may sound foolish, but his look and\r\nhis hands, his skin and his hair, everything about him is radiant with\r\npurity, radiant with peace, radiant with gaiety and gentleness and\r\nholiness. Not since the recent death of our noble teacher have I seen this\r\non anyone.”)\r\n\r\nAs Govinda was thinking these things, things which his heart strongly\r\nresisted, he bowed to Siddhartha once again, drawn by love. He bowed\r\ndeeply as Siddhartha sat peacefully.\r\n\r\n“Siddhartha,” he said, “we have grown into old men. It seems hardly\r\nlikely that either of us will see the other in his present form ever\r\nagain. I see, my dear friend, that you have found peace. I admit that I\r\nhave not. Give me another word, venerated one, give me something that I\r\ncan grasp, something I can understand! Give me something to take as I go\r\non my way. My way is often difficult, often dark, Siddhartha.”\r\n\r\nSiddhartha remained silent and continued to look at him with the same\r\nquiet smile. Govinda stared into his face, with anxiety, with yearning.\r\nSorrow and a never ending search could be read in his expression, a never\r\nending search without finding.\r\n\r\nSiddhartha saw it, and grinned.\r\n\r\n“Bow down to me!” he whispered gently into Govinda’s ear. “Bow\r\ndown to me here! Yes, closer! Very close! Kiss me on the forehead,\r\nGovinda!”\r\n\r\nGovinda was puzzled but, drawn by the great love and trust he had for his\r\nfriend, did as he was told, he bowed down close to him and touched his\r\nforehead with his lips, and something wonderful happened to him. His\r\nthoughts remained with the wonderful words that Siddhartha had spoken, he\r\nstrove in vain to remove time from his thoughts and to see nirvana and\r\nsansara as one, he felt even a certain disdain for his friend’s words\r\nwhich competed with the enormous love and veneration he felt for him, and\r\nwhile all this was going on this is what happened to him:\r\n\r\nHe could no longer see his friend’s face, instead he saw other faces,\r\nmany other faces, a long sequence of them, a flowing river of faces,\r\nhundreds of them, thousands of them, all of them came and went yet all of\r\nthem seemed to be there at the same time, all of them were in continuous\r\nchange yet all of them were Siddhartha. He saw the face of a fish, a carp\r\nwith its mouth permanently gaping in pain, a fish that was dying as its\r\neyes broke open, he saw the face of a new-born child, wrinkly, red and\r\ncontorted in its tears, he saw the face of a murderer, saw him as he\r\nthrust the knife into his victim’s body - he saw, at the same moment,\r\nthis criminal as he knelt in chains and how the executioner struck off his\r\nhead with a blow of his sword - he saw the bodies of men and women naked\r\nand struggling in positions of fervent love - he saw corpses stretched\r\nout, still, cold, empty - he saw the heads of animals, of pigs, of\r\ncrocodiles, of elephants, of bulls, of birds - he saw gods, he saw Krsna,\r\nhe saw Agni - he saw all these forms and all these faces connected with\r\neach other in a thousand places, helping each other, loving each other,\r\nhating each other, destroying each other, giving birth to them anew, each\r\nof them was a death wish, a passionate torturous acknowledgement of the\r\npast, but none of them did die but only transformed itself, underwent\r\ncontinual rebirths, each time receiving a new face although no time passed\r\nbetween one face and the next - and all these forms and all these faces\r\nrested, flowed, appeared, swam one way and flowed in between each other\r\nand above all of this there was always something thin, something that had\r\nno essence but nonetheless existed, like a thin piece of glass or ice,\r\nlike a transparent skin, a shell or a shape or a mask of water, and this\r\nmask was smiling, and this mask was Siddhartha’s smiling face which he,\r\nGovinda, was at that very moment touching with his lips. And so it was\r\nthat Govinda saw the smile on the mask, the smile of unity over and above\r\nthe forms as they rushed past, the smile of simultaneity over the thousand\r\nbirths and deaths, this smile of Siddhartha’s was exactly the same, was\r\nexactly identical, calm, fine, impenetrable, perhaps benevolent, perhaps\r\nmocking, wise, the thousand-fold smile of Gotama, the buddha, the smile he\r\nhad seen and venerated a hundred times himself. Govinda knew that this was\r\nhow the perfect ones smiled.\r\n\r\nHe no longer knew whether time existed, he no longer knew whether this\r\nvision had lasted one second or a hundred years, he no longer knew whether\r\na Siddhartha or a Gotama or an I and you existed. It was as if his deepest\r\npart had been struck with an arrow from the divine, causing a wound that\r\ntasted so sweet, his innermost part was enchanted, was dissolved. Govinda\r\ncontinued to stand there bent over Siddhartha’s quiet face, the face he\r\nhad just kissed, the face that had just been the theatre for all forms,\r\nall becoming, all existence. That face, that under its surface had shown\r\nthe depths of the thousands, remained unchanged, it bore a peaceful smile,\r\na smile that was gentle and tender, perhaps very benevolent, perhaps very\r\nmocking, just like the smile on the face of the noble one.\r\n\r\nGovinda bowed deeply, tears that he was unaware of ran from his eyes and\r\nover his aged face, the sense of deepest love burnt in him like a fire,\r\nthe humblest veneration burnt in his heart. He bowed deeply, touching the\r\nground in front of Siddhartha who sat motionless, whose smile reminded him\r\nof everything in his life he had ever loved, of everything in his life\r\nthat had been worthwhile to him, and holy.\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCreative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International\r\nPublic License\r\n\r\nBy exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to\r\nbe bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons\r\nAttribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License\r\n(\"Public License\").

If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\r\n       information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\r\n       reasonably practicable.\r\n\r\nSection 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.\r\n\r\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply\r\nto Your use of the Licensed Material:\r\n\r\n a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to\r\n  extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of\r\n  the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only and\r\n  provided You do not Share Adapted Material;\r\n b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents\r\n  in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the\r\n  database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its\r\n  individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\r\n c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\r\n  all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\r\n\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\r\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\r\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\r\n\r\nSection 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\r\n\r\n a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent\r\n  possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and\r\n  as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind\r\n  concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory,\r\n  or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title,\r\n  merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement,\r\n  absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or\r\n  absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where\r\n  disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this\r\n  disclaimer may not apply to You.\r\n b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You\r\n  on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or\r\n  otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental,\r\n  consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses,\r\n  or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed\r\n  Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of\r\n  such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of\r\n  liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not\r\n  apply to You.\r\n\r\n c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\r\n  above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible,\r\n  most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all\r\n  liability.\r\n\r\nSection 6 – Term and Termination.\r\n\r\n a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar\r\n  Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public\r\n  License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate\r\n  automatically.\r\n b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\r\n  Section 6(a), it reinstates:\r\n\r\n    1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it\r\n       is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\r\n    2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\r\n\r\n  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\r\n  right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of\r\n  this Public License.\r\n c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed\r\n  Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the\r\n  Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate\r\n  this Public License.\r\n d.

To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\r\n  deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\r\n  minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\r\n  cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\r\n  without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\r\n  conditions.\r\n c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\r\n  failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\r\n  Licensor.\r\n d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a\r\n  limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that\r\n  apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of\r\n  any jurisdiction or authority.",
