For, _Destinie_ denyes\r\n    The utt’ring of such hidden _Mysteries_,\r\n    In these respects: First, _This_ contayneth nought\r\n    Which (in a proper sense) concerneth, ought,\r\n    The _present-Age_: Moreover, tis ordain’d,\r\n    That, none must know the _Secrecies_ contain’d\r\n    Within this PIECE; but, they who are so wise\r\n    To finde them out, by their owne _prudencies_;\r\n    And, hee that can unriddle them, to us,\r\n    Shall stiled be, the second OEDIPVS.\r\n      Tis, likewise, thought expedient, now and then,\r\n    To make some _Worke_, for those _All-knowing men_,\r\n    (To exercise upon) who thinke they see\r\n    The _secret-meanings_, of all things that bee.\r\n      And, lastly, since we finde, that, some there are,\r\n    Who best affect _Inuentions_, which appeare\r\n    Beyond their understandings; _This_, we knew\r\n    A _Representment_, worthy of their view;\r\n      And, here, wee placed it, to be, to these,\r\n      A FRONTISPIECE, in any sense they please.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EMBLEMES. _Illustrated by_ Geo: Wither.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   A\r\n                              COLLECTION\r\n                                  OF\r\n                               EMBLEMES,\r\n                              ANCIENT AND\r\n                               MODERNE:\r\n\r\n                               Quickened\r\n                  With METRICALL ILLVSTRATIONS, both\r\n               _Morall_ and _Divine_: And disposed into\r\n                              LOTTERIES,\r\n\r\n      That _Jnstruction_, and _Good Counsell_, may bee furthered\r\n                by an Honest and Pleasant _Recreation_.\r\n\r\n                          _By_ GEORGE WITHER.\r\n\r\n                          _The First Booke._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n                                LONDON,\r\n             Printed by _A.M._ for _Richard Royston_, and\r\n              are to be sold at his Shop in _Ivie_-Lane.\r\n                               MDCXXXV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Recensui hoc Poëma, cui titulus est =(A Collection and Illustration\r\nof Emblems Ancient and Moderne)= in quo nihil reperio, quò minus cum\r\nutilitate imprimatur, ita tamen, ut si non intra septem menses proximè\r\nsequentes Typis mandetur, hæc licentia sit omninò irrita._\r\n\r\nEx ædibus Lambithanis\r\n  _Iul. 2. 1634._\r\n                  GVIL.

where, now, my selfe I throw\r\n    To pay once more, the _Tributes_ which I owe.\r\n      _As many yeares are past, most beauteous QVEENE,\r\n    Since witnesses, mine eares and eyes, have beene\r\n    Of those Perfections; which the generall =Fame=\r\n    Hath sounded forth, in honour of your =Name=._\r\n      And, both your _beaming-splendors_ (oh yee faire,\r\n    Thrice blessed, and most fitly-matched PAIRE)\r\n    Vpon each other, make such bright reflections;\r\n    And have so sweetly mingled your _affections_,\r\n    Your _Praise_, your _Pow’re_, your _Vertues_, and your _Beautie_:\r\n    That, (if preserving of my _Soveraigne dutie_,\r\n    This may be said) you doe appeare, to me,\r\n    TWO PERSONS, in One MAIESTY, to be;\r\n    To whom, there, appertaines (in veneration\r\n    Of your large _Worth_) the right of some _Oblation_\r\n    And, best, I thought, my _Homage_ would be done,\r\n    If, thus, the tender were to BOTH-in-ONE.\r\n    Which, in this humble GVIFT, my _Love_ presents;\r\n    And, wisheth it may adde to your Contents.\r\n      Perhaps it shall: For, though I dare not shew\r\n    These _Figures_, as well meriting your view;\r\n    Nor boast, as if their _Moralls_ couched ought,\r\n    By which your sacred _Wisdomes_ may be taught:\r\n    Yet, I have humble _Hopings_, that, they might\r\n    Prove, some way, an occasion of delight;\r\n    Since, meane and common _Objects_, now and then,\r\n    Beget contentments in the _greatest-men_.\r\n      But, that before this _Booke_, I should propose\r\n    Your praisefull NAMES, there is (as I suppose)\r\n    A faire inducement: For, considering these\r\n    Are EMBLEMS, whose intention is to please\r\n    And profit vulgar Iudgements (by the view,\r\n    Of what they ought to follow, or eschew.)\r\n    And, I well knowing, that your MAIESTIES\r\n    Set foorth before my _Booke_, in _Emblem-wise_,\r\n    Throughout your Lands, more _Vertues_ might convay,\r\n    Than many _Volumes_, of these _Emblems_, may;\r\n    It seemed _Petty-treason_, to omit\r\n    This good occasion of endeavouring it.\r\n    For, (if your MAIESTIES, well heeded, were)\r\n    YOV, double-treble-foure-fold _Emblems_ are;\r\n    Which, fully to illustrate, would require\r\n    The _Wit_ I want; or, meanes to raise, that, higher\r\n    Which I have gain’d; (and, which, as yet, hath flowne\r\n    By no incouragements, but by her owne.)\r\n      Of all the _Vertues_ OECONOMICAL,\r\n    Of _Duties_ MORAL and POLITICALL,\r\n    Your _Lives_ are _Patternes_, and faire EMBLEMS; whether\r\n    Considered apart, or both together.\r\n      Your CHILDHOODS were bright _Mirrours_, which did show\r\n    What Duties, _Children_, to their _Parents_ owe:\r\n    And, by the sequele, we now understand,\r\n    That, they who best _obay’d_, can best command.\r\n    The glorious _Vertues_ of your NVPTIALL-_state_,\r\n    Your _Courtiers_, find so hard to imitate,\r\n    That, they admire them, rather; and would sweare,\r\n    (Had others told, what, now they see and heare)\r\n    That, all the former Times, were not acquainted,\r\n    With such a _Paire_, when _Kings_ and _Queenes_ were _Sainted_.\r\n    The chastest _Cupids_, and the gamesom’st _Graces_,\r\n    Are alwaies mingled in your _Deare-embraces_.\r\n    The mutuall enterchanges of your _Loves_,\r\n    May teach affection to the _Turtle-doves_:\r\n    And, such as are, with goodly sights, delighted,\r\n    May see in _You_, all _Excellence_ united.\r\n      You, SIR, who beare _Ioves_ Thunders in your Fist,\r\n    And, (shake this _Ilands_ EMPIRE, when You list)\r\n    Did never in your _Orbe_, a _Tempest_ move,\r\n    But, by the Beautious _Mistresse_ of your _Love_\r\n    It might be calm’d. _And, in your lofty =Spheare=,\r\n    Most lovely QVEENE, Your Motions ever, were\r\n    So smoath, and, so direct; that, none can say,\r\n    They have withdrawne his Royall-heart away\r\n    From Iust =Designes=; Which, loudly speakes your =Praise=,\r\n    And, intimates much more, than, yet, it saies._\r\n      Yea, both Your _Splendors_ doe so glorious growe,\r\n    And, You, each other have out-vyed so,\r\n    In these, and other _Vertues_; that, on You,\r\n    Should I conferre what praise, I thinke, is due,\r\n    My _Lines_, (which from that staine have, yet, beene cleare)\r\n    Would Flatt’ry seeme, unto an envious eare.\r\n      But, what needs _Flatt’ry_, where the _Truth_ may teach\r\n    To praise, beyond immodest _Flatt’ries_ reach?\r\n    Or, what needs he to feare a _sland’rous-mouth_,\r\n    Who seekes no _meed_, nor utters more than Truth?\r\n      Your Princely _Vertues_, what can better show,\r\n    Than _Peace_, and _Plenty_, which have thrived so,\r\n    Whilst You have raign’d that, yet, no people see,\r\n    A _Richer_, or more _Peacefull_ time, than wee?\r\n    Your _Civill Actions_ (to the publike eye)\r\n    Are faire _examples_ of _Moralitie_,\r\n    So manifest; That, if he Truth did sing,\r\n    Who said, _The World doth imitate the King_;\r\n    My _Muses_ dare, with boldnesse to presage,\r\n    A Chast, a Pious, and a Prosperous _Age_:\r\n    And, that, the stormes which, late, these Realmes deterr’d,\r\n    Shall all be quite removed, or deferr’d\r\n    Till you Ascend; And, future times have seene,\r\n    That, your Examples have not followed beene.\r\n      Thus, you are living _Emblems_, to this _Nation_:\r\n    Which being mark’d with heedefull speculation,\r\n    May serve, as well, to helpe us how to see\r\n    Our _Happinesse_, As, what our _Duties_ be.\r\n      And, if I might unlocke all _Mysteries_,\r\n    Which doe declare, how in a _foure-fold-wise_,\r\n    Your Lives are usefull EMBLEMS; I, perchance,\r\n    Should vexe blind _Zeale_, or anger _Ignorance_;\r\n    And, teach well-temper’d _Spirits_, how to see,\r\n    That, we, for Blessings, oft, Vnthankefull be.\r\n    For, as you, _Both_, Prime _Children_ are of those\r\n    Two _Sister-Churches_, betwixt whom, yet, growes\r\n    Vnseemely _strife_; So, _You_, perhaps, may be\r\n    An _Emblem_, how those MOTHERS may agree.\r\n    And, not by your _Example_, onely, show,\r\n    How wrought it may be; but, effect it so.\r\n    Yea, peradventure, GOD, united _You_,\r\n    That, such a blessed VNION might ensue:\r\n    And, that, Your _living-lovingly_, together;\r\n    Your Christian _hopefullnesse_, of one another;\r\n    Your milde _forbearance_, harsh attempts to proove;\r\n    Your _mutuall-waiting_, untill _God_ shall move\r\n    By some _calme-voice_, or peacefull _inspiration_,\r\n    That _Heart_ Which needeth better _Information_;\r\n    And, that, your _Charities_, might give a _signe_,\r\n    How, all the _Daughters_, of the SPOVSE _Divine_\r\n    Might reconciled be; And, shew, that, _Swords_,\r\n    _Flames_, _Threats_, and _Furie_, make no true _Accords_.\r\n      GOD grant a better VNION may appeare:\r\n    Yet, wish I not the _tollerating_, here,\r\n    Of _Politicke-Agreements_; (further than\r\n    Our wholsome _Lawes_, and, _Civill-vowes_ to man,\r\n    With _Piety_, approve) but, such, as may\r\n    Make up a blessed CONCORD, every way:\r\n    Might it be so; your _Vertues_, would become\r\n    A Glorious _Blessing_, to all CHRISTENDOME:\r\n    Your EMBLEM should, by future _Generations_;\r\n    Be plac’d among the famous _Constellations_,\r\n    And, _after-times_ (though, Mee, this _Age_ despise)\r\n    Would thinke, these _Verses_, had beene _Prophecies_.\r\n      What ever may succeed, my _Pray’rs_ and _Powr’s_\r\n    Are this way bent; with _Hope_, that _You_ or _Yours_\r\n    Shall _Helps_ (at least) become, that _Breach_ to close,\r\n    Which, in the SEAMLES-ROBE, yet, wider growes.\r\n      SO BE IT: And, let bright your _Glories_ bee,\r\n      For ever, though _You_ never shine on MEE.\r\n\r\n_Your_ MAIESTIES\r\n\r\n      _most Loyall Subject_,\r\n\r\n             =GEO: WITHER.=\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE READER.\r\n\r\n\r\n_If there had not beene some =Bookes= conceitedly composed, and sutable\r\nto meane capacities, I am doubtfull, whether I had ever beene so\r\ndelighted in reading, as thereby to attaine to the little Knowledge\r\nI have: For, I doe yet remember, that, things =honestly pleasant=,\r\nbrought mee by degrees, to love that which is =truely profitable=. And\r\nas =David= said, His =Heart shewed him the wickednesse of the Vngodly=;\r\n(meaning perhaps, that hee felt in himselfe, some =Experiments=, of\r\nthe same naturall Corruption, by which they are overcome, who resist\r\nnot evill suggestions at their first motions:) Even so, I may truly\r\nacknowledge, that mine owne =Experience= hath showne mee so much of the\r\ncommon =Ignorance= and =Infirmitie= in mine owne person, that it hath\r\ntaught mee, how those things may be wrought upon in others, to their\r\nbest advantage._\r\n\r\n_Therefore, though I can say no more to disswade from =Vice=, or\r\nto incourage men to =Vertue=, than hath already beene said in many\r\nlearned =Authors=; yet I may be an occasion by these =Endeavours=,\r\nto bring that, the oftner into remembrance, which they have, more\r\nlearnedly, expressed; and perhaps, by such circumstances, as they would\r\nnot descend unto, may insinuate further also with some Capacities,\r\nthan more applauded =Meanes=. =Viniger=, =Salt=, or common =Water=,\r\n(which are very meane =Ingredients=) make Sawces more pleasing to some\r\ntastes, than =Sugar=, and =Spices=. In like manner, plaine and vulgar\r\nnotions, seasoned with a little =Pleasantnesse=, and relished with a\r\nmoderate =Sharpnesse=, worke that, otherwhile, which the most admired\r\n=Compositions= could never effect in many =Readers=; yea, wee have had\r\nfrequent proofes, that a blunt =Iest= hath moved to more consideration,\r\nthan a judicious =Discourse=._\r\n\r\n_I take little pleasures in =Rymes=, =Fictions=, or conceited\r\n=Compositions=, for their owne sakes; neither could I ever take so\r\nmuch paines, as to spend time to put my meanings into other words than\r\nsuch as flowed forth, without =Studie=; partly because I delight more\r\nin Matter, than in =Wordy Flourishes=, But, chiefely, because those\r\n=Verball Conceites=, which by some, are accounted most =Elegant=,\r\nare not onely (for the greater part) =Emptie Sounds= and Impertinent\r\n=Clinches=, in themselves; but, such =Inventions=, as do sometime,\r\nalso, obscure the =Sense=, to common =Readers=; and, serve to little\r\nother purpose, but for =Wittie men= to shew =Tricks= one to another:\r\nFor, the =Ignorant= understand them not; and the =Wise= need them not._\r\n\r\n_So much of them, as (without darkning the matter, to them who most\r\nneed instruction) may be made use of, to stirre up the =Affections=,\r\nwinne =Attention=, or help the =Memory=, I approve and make use of, to\r\nthose good purposes, according as my leisure, and the measure of my\r\n=Facultie= will permit; that, =Vanitie= might not, to worse ends, get\r\nthem wholly into her =Possession=. For, I know that the meanest of such\r\nconceites are as pertinent to some, as =Rattles=, and =Hobby-horses=\r\nto Children; or as the =A. B. C.= and =Spelling=, were at first to\r\nthose =Readers=, who are now past them.

Neverthelesse, (if some have sayd, and thought\r\ntruly) my =Poems= have instructed, and rectified many People in the\r\nCourse of =Honest-living=, (which is the best =Wisedome=) much more\r\nthan the =Austerer Volumes= of some criticall =Authors=; who, are by\r\nthe =Common-sort=, therefore onely, judged Wise, because they composed\r\n=Books=, which few understand, save they who need them not._\r\n\r\n_In these =Lots= and =Emblems=, I have the same ayme which I had in\r\nmy other =Writings=: and, though I have not dressed them sutably to\r\ncurious =Fancies=, yet, they yield wholsome nourishment to strengthen\r\nthe constitution of a =Good-life=; and, have solidity enough for\r\na =Play game=, which was but Accidentally composed; and, by this\r\n=Occasion=._\r\n\r\n_These =Emblems=, graven in Copper by =Crispinus Passæus= (with a\r\n=Motto= in Greeke, Latine, or Italian, round about every =Figure=;\r\nand with two =Lines= (or =Verses=) in one of the same =Languages=,\r\nperiphrasing those =Motto’s=) came to my hands, almost twentie yeares\r\npast. The =Verses= were so meane, that, they were afterward cut off\r\nfrom the =Plates=; And, the =Collector= of the said Emblems, (whether\r\nhee were the =Versifier= or the =Graver=, was neither so well\r\nadvised in the =Choice= of them, nor so exact in observing the true\r\n=Proprieties= belonging to every =Figure=, as hee might have beene._\r\n\r\n_Yet, the =Workman-ship= being judged very good, for the most part;\r\nand the rest excusable; some of my Friends were so much delighted\r\nin the =Gravers= art, and, in those =Illustrations=, which for mine\r\nowne pleasure, I had made upon some few of them, that, they requested\r\nmee to =Moralize= the rest. Which I condiscended unto: And, they had\r\nbeene brought to view many yeares agoe, but that the =Copper Prints=\r\n(which are now gotten) could not be procured out of =Holland=, upon any\r\nreasonable Conditions._\r\n\r\n_If they were worthy of the =Gravers= and =Printers= cost, being\r\nonely dumbe =Figures=, little usefull to any but to young =Gravers=\r\nor =Painters=, and as little delightfull, except, to =Children=,\r\nand =Childish-gazers=: they may now be much more worthy; seeing the\r\nlife of =Speach= being added unto them, may make them =Teachers= and\r\n=Remembrancers= of profitable things._\r\n\r\n_I doe not arrogate so much unto my =Illustrations=, as to thinke, they\r\nwill be able to teach any thing to the =Learned=; yet if they cast\r\ntheir eyes upon them, perhaps, these =Emblems=, and their =Morals=, may\r\nremember them, either of some =Dutie=, which they might else forget,\r\nor minde them to beware of some =Danger=, which they might otherwise\r\nbe unheedfull to prevent.

Something, also, I was =Confined=, by obliging my\r\nselfe to observe the same number of =lines= in every =Illustration=;\r\nand, otherwhile, I was thereby constrained to conclude, when my best\r\n=Meditations= were but new begunne: which (though it hath pleased Some,\r\nby the more comely Vniformitie, in the Pages) yet, it hath much injured\r\nthe libertie of my =Muse=._\r\n\r\n_There be, no doubt, some faults committed by the =Printer=, both\r\nLiterall and Materiall, and some Errors of the =Gravers= in the\r\n=Figures=, (as in the =Tetragrammaton=; in the Figure of =Arîon=; and\r\nin the =Proprieties= due to some other =Hieroglyphicks=; but, for the\r\nmost part, they are such, as =Common-Readers= will never perceive; and\r\nI thinke, that they who are =Judicious= will so plainly finde them to\r\nbe no faults of mine; that, leaving them to be amended by those, to\r\nwhom they appertaine; and, =You=, to accept of these =Play-games= as\r\nyou please: I bid you =Farewell=._\r\n\r\n\r\n            The Occasion, _Intention_, and use of the Foure\r\n               _Lotteries_ adjoyned to these foure Books\r\n                             of _Emblems_.\r\n\r\nStultorum plena sunt omnia. _The world is growne so in Love with\r\n=Follie=, that the Imprinting of over-solid and serious =treatises=\r\nwould undoe the Book-sellers; especially, being so chargeable as the\r\nmany costly =Sculptures= have made this Booke: therefore, (to advance\r\ntheir =Profits=, rather than to satisfie my owne =Iudgement=) I was\r\nmoved to invent somewhat, which might be likely to please the vulgar\r\nCapacitie, without hindrance to my chiefe =End=.
