They must\r\nselect for this purpose easy subjects, and restrict themselves to the\r\nexposition of the simplest and the most essential points. Nevertheless,\r\nby an appropriate choice of the matter, the _charm_ and the _poetry_ of\r\nresearch can be conveyed by them. It is only necessary to set forth the\r\nattractive and the alluring features of a problem, and to show what\r\nbroad domains of fact can be illuminated by the light radiating from the\r\nsolution of a single and ofttimes unobtrusive point.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, such lectures can exercise a favorable influence by showing\r\nthe substantial sameness of scientific and every-day thought. The\r\npublic, in this way, loses its shyness towards scientific questions, and\r\nacquires an interest in scientific work which is a great help to the\r\ninquirer. The latter, in his turn, is brought to understand that his\r\nwork is a small part only of the universal process of life, and that the\r\nresults of his labors must redound to the benefit not only of himself\r\nand a few of his associates, but to that of the collective whole.\r\n\r\nI sincerely hope that these lectures, in the present excellent\r\ntranslation, will be productive of good in the direction indicated.\r\n\r\n    E. MACH.\r\n\r\nPRAGUE, December, 1894.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATOR'S NOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present third edition of this work has been enlarged by the addition\r\nof a new lecture, \"On Some Phenomena Attending the Flight of\r\nProjectiles.\" The additions to the second consisted of the following\r\nfour lectures and articles: Professor Mach's Vienna Inaugural Lecture,\r\n\"The Part Played by Accident in Invention and Discovery,\" the lecture on\r\n\"Sensations of Orientation,\" recently delivered and summing up the\r\nresults of an important psychological investigation, and two historical\r\narticles (see Appendix) on Acoustics and Sight.\r\n\r\nThe lectures extend over a long period, from 1864 to 1898, and differ\r\ngreatly in style, contents, and purpose. They were first published in\r\ncollected form in English; afterwards two German editions were called\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nAs the dates of the first five lectures are not given in the footnotes\r\nthey are here appended. The first lecture, \"On the Forms of Liquids,\"\r\nwas delivered in 1868 and published with that \"On Symmetry\" in 1872\r\n(Prague). The second and third lectures, on acoustics, were first\r\npublished in 1865 (Graz); the fourth and fifth, on optics, in 1867\r\n(Graz). They belong to the earliest period of Professor Mach's\r\nscientific activity, and with the lectures on electrostatics and\r\neducation will more than realise the hope expressed in the author's\r\nPreface.\r\n\r\nThe eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth lectures are of a more\r\nphilosophical character and deal principally with the methods and nature\r\nof scientific inquiry. In the ideas summarised in them will be found one\r\nof the most important contributions to the theory of knowledge made in\r\nthe last quarter of a century. Significant hints in psychological\r\nmethod, and exemplary specimen-researches in psychology and physics, are\r\nalso presented; while in physics many ideas find their first discussion\r\nthat afterwards, under other names and other authorship, became\r\nrallying-cries in this department of inquiry.\r\n\r\nAll the proofs of this translation have been read by Professor Mach\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n    T.

Is the holy holy because the gods love it, or are the gods\r\nholy because they love the holy? By such easy questions did the wise\r\nSocrates make the market-place of Athens unsafe and relieve presumptuous\r\nyoung statesmen of the burden of imaginary knowledge, by showing them\r\nhow confused, unclear, and self-contradictory their ideas were.\r\n\r\nYou know the fate of the importunate questioner. So called good society\r\navoided him on the promenade. Only the ignorant accompanied him. And\r\nfinally he drank the cup of hemlock--a lot which we ofttimes wish would\r\nfall to modern critics of his stamp.\r\n\r\nWhat we have learned from Socrates, however,--our inheritance from\r\nhim,--is scientific criticism. Every one who busies himself with science\r\nrecognises how unsettled and indefinite the notions are which he has\r\nbrought with him from common life, and how, on a minute examination of\r\nthings, old differences are effaced and new ones introduced. The\r\nhistory of science is full of examples of this constant change,\r\ndevelopment, and clarification of ideas.\r\n\r\nBut we will not linger by this general consideration of the fluctuating\r\ncharacter of ideas, which becomes a source of real uncomfortableness,\r\nwhen we reflect that it applies to almost every notion of life. Rather\r\nshall we observe by the study of a physical example how much a thing\r\nchanges when it is closely examined, and how it assumes, when thus\r\nconsidered, increasing definiteness of form.\r\n\r\nThe majority of you think, perhaps, you know quite well the distinction\r\nbetween a liquid and a solid. And precisely persons who have never\r\nbusied themselves with physics will consider this question one of the\r\neasiest that can be put. But the physicist knows that it is one of the\r\nmost difficult. I shall mention here only the experiments of Tresca,\r\nwhich show that solids subjected to high pressures behave exactly as\r\nliquids do; for example, may be made to flow out in the form of jets\r\nfrom orifices in the bottoms of vessels. The supposed difference of kind\r\nbetween liquids and solids is thus shown to be a mere difference of\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nThe common inference that because the earth is oblate in form, it was\r\noriginally fluid, is an error, in the light of these facts. True, a\r\nrotating sphere, a few inches in diameter will assume an oblate form\r\nonly if it is very soft, for example, is composed of freshly kneaded\r\nclay or some viscous stuff. But the earth, even if it consisted of the\r\nrigidest stone, could not help being crushed by its tremendous weight,\r\nand must perforce behave as a fluid. Even our mountains could not extend\r\nbeyond a certain height without crumbling. The earth _may_ once have\r\nbeen fluid, but this by no means follows from its oblateness.\r\n\r\nThe particles of a liquid are displaced on the application of the\r\nslightest pressure; a liquid conforms exactly to the shapes of the\r\nvessels in which it is contained; it possesses no form of its own, as\r\nyou have all learned in the schools. Accommodating itself in the most\r\ntrifling respects to the conditions of the vessel in which it is placed,\r\nand showing, even on its surface, where one would suppose it had the\r\nfreest play, nothing but a polished, smiling, expressionless\r\ncountenance, it is the courtier _par excellence_ of the natural bodies.\r\n\r\nLiquids have no form of their own! No, not for the superficial observer.\r\nBut persons who have observed that a raindrop is round and never\r\nangular, will not be disposed to accept this dogma so unconditionally.\r\n\r\nIt is fair to suppose that every man, even the weakest, would possess a\r\ncharacter, if it were not too difficult in this world to keep it. So,\r\ntoo, we must suppose that liquids would possess forms of their own, if\r\nthe pressure of the circumstances permitted it,--if they were not\r\ncrushed by their own weights.\r\n\r\nAn astronomer once calculated that human beings could not exist on the\r\nsun, apart from its great heat, because they would be crushed to pieces\r\nthere by their own weight. The greater mass of this body would also\r\nmake the weight of the human body there much greater. But on the moon,\r\nbecause here we should be much lighter, we could jump as high as the\r\nchurch-steeples without any difficulty, with the same muscular power\r\nwhich we now possess. Statues and \"plaster\" casts of syrup are\r\nundoubtedly things of fancy, even on the moon, but maple-syrup would\r\nflow so slowly there that we could easily build a maple-syrup man on the\r\nmoon, for the fun of the thing, just as our children here build\r\nsnow-men.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, if liquids have no form of their own with us on earth, they\r\nhave, perhaps, a form of their own on the moon, or on some smaller and\r\nlighter heavenly body. The problem, then, simply is to get rid of the\r\neffects of gravity; and, this done, we shall be able to find out what\r\nthe peculiar forms of liquids are.\r\n\r\nThe problem was solved by Plateau of Ghent, whose method was to immerse\r\nthe liquid in another of the same specific gravity.[1] He employed for\r\nhis experiments oil and a mixture of alcohol and water. By Archimedes's\r\nwell-known principle, the oil in this mixture loses its entire weight.\r\nIt no longer sinks beneath its weight; its formative forces, be they\r\never so weak, are now in full play.\r\n\r\nAs a fact, we now see, to our surprise, that the oil, instead of\r\nspreading out into a layer, or lying in a formless mass, assumes the\r\nshape of a beautiful and perfect sphere, freely suspended in the\r\nmixture, as the moon is in space. We can construct in this way a sphere\r\nof oil several inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nIf, now, we affix a thin plate to a wire and insert the plate in the oil\r\nsphere, we can, by twisting the wire between our fingers, set the whole\r\nball in rotation. Doing this, the ball assumes an oblate shape, and we\r\ncan, if we are skilful enough, separate by such rotation a ring from the\r\nball, like that which surrounds Saturn. This ring is finally rent\r\nasunder, and, breaking up into a number of smaller balls, exhibits to us\r\na kind of model of the origin of the planetary system according to the\r\nhypothesis of Kant and Laplace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nStill more curious are the phenomena exhibited when the formative forces\r\nof the liquid are partly disturbed by putting in contact with the\r\nliquid's surface some rigid body. If we immerse, for example, the wire\r\nframework of a cube in our mass of oil, the oil will everywhere stick to\r\nthe wire framework. If the quantity of oil is exactly sufficient we\r\nshall obtain an oil cube with perfectly smooth walls. If there is too\r\nmuch or too little oil, the walls of the cube will bulge out or cave in.\r\nIn this manner we can produce all kinds of geometrical figures of oil,\r\nfor example, a three-sided pyramid, a cylinder (by bringing the oil\r\nbetween two wire rings), and so on. Interesting is the change of form\r\nthat occurs when we gradually suck out the oil by means of a glass tube\r\nfrom the cube or pyramid. The wire holds the oil fast. The figure grows\r\nsmaller and smaller, until it is at last quite thin. Ultimately it\r\nconsists simply of a number of thin, smooth plates of oil, which extend\r\nfrom the edges of the cube to the centre, where they meet in a small\r\ndrop. The same is true of the pyramid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nThe idea now suggests itself that liquid figures as thin as this, and\r\npossessing, therefore, so slight a weight, cannot be crushed or deformed\r\nby their weight; just as a small, soft ball of clay is not affected in\r\nthis respect by its weight. This being the case, we no longer need our\r\nmixture of alcohol and water for the production of figures, but can\r\nconstruct them in the open air. And Plateau, in fact, found that these\r\nthin figures, or at least very similar ones, could be produced in the\r\nair, by dipping the wire nets described in a solution of soap and water\r\nand quickly drawing them out again. The experiment is not difficult. The\r\nfigure is formed of itself. The preceding drawing represents to the eye\r\nthe forms obtained with cubical and pyramidal nets. In the cube, thin,\r\nsmooth films of soap-suds proceed from the edges to a small, quadratic\r\nfilm in the centre. In the pyramid, a film proceeds from each edge to\r\nthe centre.\r\n\r\nThese figures are so beautiful that they hardly admit of appropriate\r\ndescription. Their great regularity and geometrical exactness evokes\r\nsurprise from all who see them for the first time. Unfortunately, they\r\nare of only short duration. They burst, on the drying of the solution in\r\nthe air, but only after exhibiting to us the most brilliant play of\r\ncolors, such as is often seen in soap-bubbles. Partly their beauty of\r\nform and partly our desire to examine them more minutely induces us to\r\nconceive of methods of endowing them with permanent form. This is very\r\nsimply done.[2] Instead of dipping the wire nets in solutions of soap,\r\nwe dip them in pure melted colophonium (resin). When drawn out the\r\nfigure at once forms and solidifies by contact with the air.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remarked that also solid fluid-figures can be constructed\r\nin the open air, if their weight be light enough, or the wire nets of\r\nvery small dimensions. If we make, for example, of very fine wire a\r\ncubical net whose sides measure about one-eighth of an inch in length,\r\nwe need simply to dip this net in water to obtain a small solid cube of\r\nwater. With a piece of blotting paper the superfluous water may be\r\neasily removed and the sides of the cube made smooth.\r\n\r\nYet another simple method may be devised for observing these figures. A\r\ndrop of water on a greased glass plate will not run if it is small\r\nenough, but will be flattened by its weight, which presses it against\r\nits support. The smaller the drop the less the flattening. The smaller\r\nthe drop the nearer it approaches the form of a sphere. On the other\r\nhand, a drop suspended from a stick is elongated by its weight. The\r\nundermost parts of a drop of water on a support are pressed against the\r\nsupport, and the upper parts are pressed against the lower parts because\r\nthe latter cannot yield. But when a drop falls freely downward all its\r\nparts move equally fast; no part is impeded by another; no part presses\r\nagainst another. A freely falling drop, accordingly, is not affected by\r\nits weight; it acts as if it were weightless; it assumes a spherical\r\nform.\r\n\r\nA moment's glance at the soap-film figures produced by our various wire\r\nmodels, reveals to us a great multiplicity of form. But great as this\r\nmultiplicity is, the common features of the figures also are easily\r\ndiscernible.\r\n\r\n    \"All forms of Nature are allied, though none is the same as the other;\r\n    Thus, their common chorus points to a hidden law.\"\r\n\r\nThis hidden law Plateau discovered. It may be expressed, somewhat\r\nprosily, as follows:\r\n\r\n1) If several plane liquid films meet in a figure they are always three\r\nin number, and, taken in pairs, form, each with another, nearly equal\r\nangles.\r\n\r\n2) If several liquid edges meet in a figure they are always four in\r\nnumber, and, taken in pairs, form, each with another, nearly equal\r\nangles.\r\n\r\nThis is a strange law, and its reason is not evident. But we might apply\r\nthis criticism to almost all laws. It is not always that the motives of\r\na law-maker are discernible in the form of the law he constructs. But\r\nour law admits of analysis into very simple elements or reasons. If we\r\nclosely examine the paragraphs which state it, we shall find that their\r\nmeaning is simply this, that the surface of the liquid assumes the shape\r\nof smallest area that is possible under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, some extraordinarily intelligent tailor, possessing a\r\nknowledge of all the artifices of the higher mathematics, should set\r\nhimself the task of so covering the wire frame of a cube with cloth that\r\nevery piece of cloth should be connected with the wire and joined with\r\nthe remaining cloth, and should seek to accomplish this feat with the\r\ngreatest saving of material, he would construct no other figure than\r\nthat which is here formed on the wire frame in our solution of soap and\r\nwater. Nature acts in the construction of liquid figures on the\r\nprinciple of a covetous tailor, and gives no thought in her work to the\r\nfashions. But, strange to say, in this work, the most beautiful fashions\r\nare of themselves produced.\r\n\r\nThe two paragraphs which state our law apply primarily only to soap-film\r\nfigures, and are not applicable, of course, to solid oil-figures. But\r\nthe principle that the superficial area of the liquid shall be the least\r\npossible under the circumstances, is applicable to all fluid figures. He\r\nwho understands not only the letter but also the reason of the law will\r\nnot be at a loss when confronted with cases to which the letter does not\r\naccurately apply. And this is the case with the principle of least\r\nsuperficial area. It is a sure guide for us even in cases in which the\r\nabove-stated paragraphs are not applicable.\r\n\r\nOur first task will now be, to show by a palpable illustration the mode\r\nof formation of liquid figures by the principle of least superficial\r\narea. The oil on the wire pyramid in our mixture of alcohol and water,\r\nbeing unable to leave the wire edges, clings to them, and the given mass\r\nof oil strives so to shape itself that its surface shall have the least\r\npossible area. Suppose we attempt to imitate this phenomenon. We take a\r\nwire pyramid, draw over it a stout film of rubber, and in place of the\r\nwire handle insert a small tube leading into the interior of the space\r\nenclosed by the rubber (Fig. 3). Through this tube we can blow in or\r\nsuck out air. The quantity of air in the enclosure represents the\r\nquantity of oil. The stretched rubber film, which, clinging to the wire\r\nedges, does its utmost to contract, represents the surface of the oil\r\nendeavoring to decrease its area. By blowing in, and drawing out the\r\nair, now, we actually obtain all the oil pyramidal figures, from those\r\nbulged out to those hollowed in. Finally, when all the air is pumped or\r\nsucked out, the soap-film figure is exhibited. The rubber films strike\r\ntogether, assume the form of planes, and meet at four sharp edges in the\r\ncentre of the pyramid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.]\r\n\r\nThe tendency of soap-films to assume smaller forms may be directly\r\ndemonstrated by a method of Van der Mensbrugghe. If we dip a square wire\r\nframe to which a handle is attached into a solution of soap and water,\r\nwe shall obtain on the frame a beautiful, plane film of soap-suds. (Fig.\r\n4.) On this we lay a thread having its two ends tied together. If, now,\r\nwe puncture the part enclosed by the thread, we shall obtain a soap-film\r\nhaving a circular hole in it, whose circumference is the thread. The\r\nremainder of the film decreasing in area as much as it can, the hole\r\nassumes the largest area that it can. But the figure of largest area,\r\nwith a given periphery, is the circle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.]\r\n\r\nSimilarly, by the principle of least superficial area, a freely\r\nsuspended mass of oil assumes the shape of a sphere. The sphere is the\r\nform of least surface for a given content. This is evident. The more we\r\nput into a travelling-bag, the nearer its shape approaches the spherical\r\nform.\r\n\r\nThe connexion of the two above-mentioned paragraphs with the principle\r\nof least superficial area may be shown by a yet simpler example. Picture\r\nto yourselves four fixed pulleys, _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, and two movable\r\nrings _f_, _g_ (Fig. 5); about the pulleys and through the rings imagine\r\na smooth cord passed, fastened at one extremity to a nail _e_, and\r\nloaded at the other with a weight _h_. Now this weight always tends to\r\nsink, or, what is the same thing, always tends to make the portion of\r\nthe string _e h_ as long as possible, and consequently the remainder of\r\nthe string, wound round the pulleys, as short as possible. The strings\r\nmust remain connected with the pulleys, and on account of the rings also\r\nwith each other. The conditions of the case, accordingly, are similar to\r\nthose of the liquid figures discussed. The result also is a similar one.\r\nWhen, as in the right hand figure of the cut, four pairs of strings\r\nmeet, a different configuration must be established. The consequence of\r\nthe endeavor of the string to shorten itself is that the rings separate\r\nfrom each other, and that now at all points only three pairs of strings\r\nmeet, every two at equal angles of one hundred and twenty degrees. As a\r\nfact, by this arrangement the greatest possible shortening of the string\r\nis attained; as can be easily proved by geometry.\r\n\r\nThis will help us to some extent to understand the creation of beautiful\r\nand complicated figures by the simple tendency of liquids to assume\r\nsurfaces of least superficial area. But the question arises, _Why_ do\r\nliquids seek surfaces of least superficial area?\r\n\r\nThe particles of a liquid cling together. Drops brought into contact\r\ncoalesce. We can say, liquid particles attract each other. If so, they\r\nseek to come as close as they can to each other. The particles at the\r\nsurface will endeavor to penetrate as far as they can into the interior.\r\nThis process will not stop, cannot stop, until the surface has become as\r\nsmall as under the circumstances it possibly can become, until as few\r\nparticles as possible remain at the surface, until as many particles as\r\npossible have penetrated into the interior, until the forces of\r\nattraction have no more work to perform.[3]\r\n\r\nThe root of the principle of least surface is to be sought, accordingly,\r\nin another and much simpler principle, which may be illustrated by some\r\nsuch analogy as this. We can _conceive_ of the natural forces of\r\nattraction and repulsion as purposes or intentions of nature. As a\r\nmatter of fact, that interior pressure which we feel before an act and\r\nwhich we call an intention or purpose, is not, in a final analysis, so\r\nessentially different from the pressure of a stone on its support, or\r\nthe pressure of a magnet on another, that it is necessarily unallowable\r\nto use for both the same term--at least for well-defined purposes.[4] It\r\nis the purpose of nature, accordingly, to bring the iron nearer the\r\nmagnet, the stone nearer the centre of the earth, and so forth. If such\r\na purpose can be realised, it is carried out. But where she cannot\r\nrealise her purposes, nature does nothing. In this respect she acts\r\nexactly as a good man of business does.\r\n\r\nIt is a constant purpose of nature to bring weights lower. We can raise\r\na weight by causing another, larger weight to sink; that is, by\r\nsatisfying another, more powerful, purpose of nature. If we fancy we are\r\nmaking nature serve our purposes in this, it will be found, upon closer\r\nexamination, that the contrary is true, and that nature has employed us\r\nto attain her purposes.\r\n\r\nEquilibrium, rest, exists only, but then always, when nature is brought\r\nto a halt in her purposes, when the forces of nature are as fully\r\nsatisfied as, under the circumstances, they can be. Thus, for example,\r\nheavy bodies are in equilibrium, when their so-called centre of gravity\r\nlies as low as it possibly can, or when as much weight as the\r\ncircumstances admit of has sunk as low as it can.\r\n\r\nThe idea forcibly suggests itself that perhaps this principle also holds\r\ngood in other realms. Equilibrium exists also in the state when the\r\npurposes of the parties are as fully satisfied as for the time being\r\nthey can be, or, as we may say, jestingly, in the language of physics,\r\nwhen the social potential is a maximum.[5]\r\n\r\nYou see, our miserly mercantile principle is replete with\r\nconsequences.[6] The result of sober research, it has become as fruitful\r\nfor physics as the dry questions of Socrates for science generally. If\r\nthe principle seems to lack in ideality, the more ideal are the fruits\r\nwhich it bears.\r\n\r\nBut why, tell me, should science be ashamed of such a principle? Is\r\nscience[7] itself anything more than--a business? Is not its task to\r\nacquire with the least possible work, in the least possible time, with\r\nthe least possible thought, the greatest possible part of eternal truth?\r\n\r\n\r\n  FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: _Statique expérimentale et théorique des liquids_,\r\n  1873.

How pretty that wooded dell must\r\nlook from yonder hill! Whither does that clear brook flow, that hides\r\nitself in yonder sedge? If I only knew how the landscape looked behind\r\nthat mountain! Thus even the child thinks in his first rambles. It is\r\nalso true of the natural philosopher.\r\n\r\nThe first questions are forced upon the attention of the inquirer by\r\npractical considerations; the subsequent ones are not. An irresistible\r\nattraction draws him to these; a nobler interest which far transcends\r\nthe mere needs of life. Let us look at a special case.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the structure of the organ of hearing has actively\r\nengaged the attention of anatomists. A considerable number of brilliant\r\ndiscoveries has been brought to light by their labors, and a splendid\r\narray of facts and truths established. But with these facts a host of\r\nnew enigmas has been presented.\r\n\r\nWhilst in the theory of the organisation and functions of the eye\r\ncomparative clearness has been attained; whilst, hand in hand with this,\r\nophthalmology has reached a degree of perfection which the preceding\r\ncentury could hardly have dreamed of, and by the help of the\r\nophthalmoscope the observing physician penetrates into the profoundest\r\nrecesses of the eye, the theory of the ear is still much shrouded in\r\nmysterious darkness, full of attraction for the investigator.\r\n\r\nLook at this model of the ear. Even at that familiar part by whose\r\nextent we measure the quantity of people's intelligence, even at the\r\nexternal ear, the problems begin. You see here a succession of helixes\r\nor spiral windings, at times very pretty, whose significance we cannot\r\naccurately state, yet for which there must certainly be some reason.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.]\r\n\r\nThe shell or concha of the ear, _a_ in the annexed diagram, conducts the\r\nsound into the curved auditory passage _b_, which is terminated by a\r\nthin membrane, the so-called tympanic membrane, _e_. This membrane is\r\nset in motion by the sound, and in its turn sets in motion a series of\r\nlittle bones of very peculiar formation, _c_. At the end of all is the\r\nlabyrinth _d_. The labyrinth consists of a group of cavities filled with\r\na liquid, in which the innumerable fibres of the nerve of hearing are\r\nimbedded. By the vibration of the chain of bones _c_, the liquid of the\r\nlabyrinth is shaken, and the auditory nerve excited. Here the process of\r\nhearing begins. So much is certain. But the details of the process are\r\none and all unanswered questions.\r\n\r\nTo these old puzzles, the Marchese Corti, as late as 1851, added a new\r\nenigma. And, strange to say, it is this last enigma, which, perhaps, has\r\nfirst received its correct solution. This will be the subject of our\r\nremarks to-day.\r\n\r\nCorti found in the cochlea, or snail-shell of the labyrinth, a large\r\nnumber of microscopic fibres placed side by side in geometrically\r\ngraduated order. According to Kölliker their number is three thousand.\r\nThey were also the subject of investigation at the hands of Max Schultze\r\nand Deiters.\r\n\r\nA description of the details of this organ would only weary you, besides\r\nnot rendering the matter much clearer. I prefer, therefore, to state\r\nbriefly what in the opinion of prominent investigators like Helmholtz\r\nand Fechner is the peculiar function of Corti's fibres. The cochlea, it\r\nseems, contains a large number of elastic fibres of graduated lengths\r\n(Fig. 7), to which the branches of the auditory nerve are attached.\r\nThese fibres, called the fibres, pillars, or rods of Corti, being of\r\nunequal length, must also be of unequal elasticity, and, consequently,\r\npitched to different notes. The cochlea, therefore, is a species of\r\npianoforte.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.]\r\n\r\nWhat, now, may be the office of this structure, which is found in no\r\nother organ of sense? May it not be connected with some special\r\nproperty of the ear? It is quite probable; for the ear possesses a very\r\nsimilar power. You know that it is possible to follow the individual\r\nvoices of a symphony. Indeed, the feat is possible even in a fugue of\r\nBach, where it is certainly no inconsiderable achievement. The ear can\r\npick out the single constituent tonal parts, not only of a harmony, but\r\nof the wildest clash of music imaginable. The musical ear analyses every\r\nagglomeration of tones.\r\n\r\nThe eye does not possess this ability. Who, for example, could tell from\r\nthe mere sight of white, without a previous experimental knowledge of\r\nthe fact, that white is composed of a mixture of other colors? Could it\r\nbe, now, that these two facts, the property of the ear just mentioned,\r\nand the structure discovered by Corti, are really connected? It is very\r\nprobable. The enigma is solved if we assume that every note of definite\r\npitch has its special string in this pianoforte of Corti, and,\r\ntherefore, its special branch of the auditory nerve attached to that\r\nstring. But before I can make this point perfectly plain to you, I must\r\nask you to follow me a few steps into the dry domain of physics.\r\n\r\nLook at this pendulum. Forced from its position of equilibrium by an\r\nimpulse, it begins to swing with a definite time of oscillation,\r\ndependent upon its length. Longer pendulums swing more slowly, shorter\r\nones more quickly. We will suppose our pendulum to execute one\r\nto-and-fro movement in a second.\r\n\r\nThis pendulum, now, can be thrown into violent vibration in two ways;\r\neither by a _single_ heavy impulse, or by a _number_ of properly\r\ncommunicated slight impulses. For example, we impart to the pendulum,\r\nwhile at rest in its position of equilibrium, a very slight impulse. It\r\nwill execute a very small vibration. As it passes a third time its\r\nposition of equilibrium, a second having elapsed, we impart to it again\r\na slight shock, in the same direction with the first. Again after the\r\nlapse of a second, on its fifth passage through the position of\r\nequilibrium, we strike it again in the same manner; and so continue. You\r\nsee, by this process the shocks imparted augment continually the motion\r\nof the pendulum. After each slight impulse, the pendulum reaches out a\r\nlittle further in its swing, and finally acquires a considerable\r\nmotion.[8]\r\n\r\nBut this is not the case under all circumstances. It is possible only\r\nwhen the impulses imparted synchronise with the swings of the pendulum.\r\nIf we should communicate the second impulse at the end of half a second\r\nand in the same direction with the first impulse, its effects would\r\ncounteract the motion of the pendulum. It is easily seen that our little\r\nimpulses help the motion of the pendulum more and more, according as\r\ntheir time accords with the time of the pendulum. If we strike the\r\npendulum in any other time than in that of its vibration, in some\r\ninstances, it is true, we shall augment its vibration, but in others\r\nagain, we shall obstruct it. Our impulses will be less effective the\r\nmore the motion of our own hand departs from the motion of the pendulum.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of the pendulum holds true of every vibrating body. A\r\ntuning-fork when it sounds, also vibrates. It vibrates more rapidly when\r\nits sound is higher; more slowly when it is deeper. The standard _A_ of\r\nour musical scale is produced by about four hundred and fifty vibrations\r\nin a second.\r\n\r\nI place by the side of each other on this table two tuning-forks,\r\nexactly alike, resting on resonant cases. I strike the first one a sharp\r\nblow, so that it emits a loud note, and immediately grasp it again with\r\nmy hand to quench its note. Nevertheless, you still hear the note\r\ndistinctly sounded, and by feeling it you may convince yourselves that\r\nthe other fork which was not struck now vibrates.\r\n\r\nI now attach a small bit of wax to one of the forks. It is thrown thus\r\nout of tune; its note is made a little deeper. I now repeat the same\r\nexperiment with the two forks, now of unequal pitch, by striking one of\r\nthem and again grasping it with my hand; but in the present case the\r\nnote ceases the very instant I touch the fork.\r\n\r\nWhat has happened here in these two experiments? Simply this. The\r\nvibrating fork imparts to the air and to the table four hundred and\r\nfifty shocks a second, which are carried over to the other fork. If the\r\nother fork is pitched to the same note, that is to say, if it vibrates\r\nwhen struck in the same time with the first, then the shocks first\r\nemitted, no matter how slight they may be, are sufficient to throw the\r\nsecond fork into rapid sympathetic vibration. But when the time of\r\nvibration of the two forks is slightly different, this does not take\r\nplace. We may strike as many forks as we will, the fork tuned to _A_ is\r\nperfectly indifferent to their notes; is deaf, in fact, to all except\r\nits own; and if you strike three, or four, or five, or any number\r\nwhatsoever, of forks all at the same time, so as to make the shocks\r\nwhich come from them ever so great, the _A_ fork will not join in with\r\ntheir vibrations unless another fork _A_ is found in the collection\r\nstruck. It picks out, in other words, from all the notes sounded, that\r\nwhich accords with it.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of all bodies which can yield notes. Tumblers resound\r\nwhen a piano is played, on the striking of certain notes, and so do\r\nwindow panes. Nor is the phenomenon without analogy in other provinces.\r\nTake a dog that answers to the name \"Nero.\" He lies under your table.\r\nYou speak of Domitian, Vespasian, and Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, you\r\ncall upon all the names of the Roman Emperors that occur to you, but the\r\ndog does not stir, although a slight tremor of his ear tells you of a\r\nfaint response of his consciousness. But the moment you call \"Nero\" he\r\njumps joyfully towards you. The tuning-fork is like your dog. It answers\r\nto the name _A_.\r\n\r\nYou smile, ladies. You shake your heads. The simile does not catch your\r\nfancy. But I have another, which is very near to you: and for punishment\r\nyou shall hear it. You, too, are like tuning-forks. Many are the hearts\r\nthat throb with ardor for you, of which you take no notice, but are\r\ncold. Yet what does it profit you! Soon the heart will come that beats\r\nin just the proper rhythm, and then your knell, too, has struck. Then\r\nyour heart, too, will beat in unison, whether you will or no.\r\n\r\nThe law of sympathetic vibration, here propounded for sounding bodies,\r\nsuffers some modification for bodies incompetent to yield notes. Bodies\r\nof this kind vibrate to almost every note. A high silk hat, we know,\r\nwill not sound; but if you will hold your hat in your hand when\r\nattending your next concert you will not only hear the pieces played,\r\nbut also feel them with your fingers. It is exactly so with men. People\r\nwho are themselves able to give tone to their surroundings, bother\r\nlittle about the prattle of others. But the person without character\r\ntarries everywhere: in the temperance hall, and at the bar of the\r\npublic-house--everywhere where a committee is formed. The high silk hat\r\nis among bells what the weakling is among men of conviction.\r\n\r\nA sonorous body, therefore, always sounds when its special note, either\r\nalone or in company with others, is struck. We may now go a step\r\nfurther. What will be the behaviour of a group of sonorous bodies which\r\nin the pitch of their notes form a scale? Let us picture to ourselves,\r\nfor example (Fig. 8), a series of rods or strings pitched to the notes\r\n_c d e f g_.... On a musical instrument the accord _c e g_ is struck.\r\nEvery one of the rods of Fig. 8 will see if its special note is\r\ncontained in the accord, and if it finds it, it will respond. The rod\r\n_c_ will give at once the note _c_, the rod _e_ the note _e_, the rod\r\n_g_ the note _g_. All the other rods will remain at rest, will not\r\nsound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.]\r\n\r\nWe need not look about us long for such an instrument. Every piano is an\r\ninstrument of this kind, with which the experiment mentioned may be\r\nexecuted with splendid success. Two pianos stand here by the side of\r\neach other, both tuned alike. We will employ the first for exciting the\r\nnotes, while we will allow the second to respond; after having first\r\npressed upon the loud pedal, so as to render all the strings capable of\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nEvery harmony struck with vigor on the first piano is distinctly\r\nrepeated on the second. To prove that it is the same strings that are\r\nsounded in both pianos, we repeat the experiment in a slightly changed\r\nform. We let go the loud pedal of the second piano and pressing on the\r\nkeys _c e g_ of that instrument vigorously strike the harmony _c e g_ on\r\nthe first piano. The harmony _c e g_ is now also sounded on the second\r\npiano. But if we press only on one key _g_ of one piano, while we strike\r\n_c e g_ on the other, only _g_ will be sounded on the second. It is\r\nthus always the like strings of the two pianos that excite each other.\r\n\r\nThe piano can reproduce any sound that is composed of its musical notes.\r\nIt will reproduce, for example, very distinctly, a vowel sound that is\r\nsung into it. And in truth physics has proved that the vowels may be\r\nregarded as composed of simple musical notes.\r\n\r\nYou see that by the exciting of definite tones in the air quite definite\r\nmotions are set up with mechanical necessity in the piano. The idea\r\nmight be made use of for the performance of some pretty pieces of\r\nwizardry. Imagine a box in which is a stretched string of definite\r\npitch. This is thrown into motion as often as its note is sung or\r\nwhistled. Now it would not be a very difficult task for a skilful\r\nmechanic to so construct the box that the vibrating cord would close a\r\ngalvanic circuit and open the lock. And it would not be a much more\r\ndifficult task to construct a box which would open at the whistling of a\r\ncertain melody. Sesame! and the bolts fall. Truly, we should have here a\r\nveritable puzzle-lock. Still another fragment rescued from that old\r\nkingdom of fables, of which our day has realised so much, that world of\r\nfairy-stories to which the latest contributions are Casselli's\r\ntelegraph, by which one can write at a distance in one's own hand, and\r\nProf. Elisha Gray's telautograph. What would the good old Herodotus have\r\nsaid to these things who even in Egypt shook his head at much that he\r\nsaw? [Greek: emoi men ou pista], just as simple-heartedly as then, when\r\nhe heard of the circumnavigation of Africa.\r\n\r\nA new puzzle-lock! But why invent one? Are not we human beings ourselves\r\npuzzle-locks? Think of the stupendous groups of thoughts, feelings, and\r\nemotions that can be aroused in us by a word! Are there not moments in\r\nall our lives when a mere name drives the blood to our hearts? Who that\r\nhas attended a large mass-meeting has not experienced what tremendous\r\nquantities of energy and motion can be evolved by the innocent words,\r\n\"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.\"\r\n\r\nBut let us return to the subject proper of our discourse. Let us look\r\nagain at our piano, or what will do just as well, at some other\r\ncontrivance of the same character. What does this instrument do?\r\nPlainly, it decomposes, it analyses every agglomeration of sounds set up\r\nin the air into its individual component parts, each tone being taken up\r\nby a different string; it performs a real spectral analysis of sound. A\r\nperson completely deaf, with the help of a piano, simply by touching the\r\nstrings or examining their vibrations with a microscope, might\r\ninvestigate the sonorous motion of the air, and pick out the separate\r\ntones excited in it.\r\n\r\nThe ear has the same capacity as this piano. The ear performs for the\r\nmind what the piano performs for a person who is deaf. The mind without\r\nthe ear is deaf. But a deaf person, with the piano, does hear after a\r\nfashion, though much less vividly, and more clumsily, than with the\r\near. The ear, thus, also decomposes sound into its component tonal\r\nparts. I shall now not be deceived, I think, if I assume that you\r\nalready have a presentiment of what the function of Corti's fibres is.\r\nWe can make the matter very plain to ourselves. We will use the one\r\npiano for exciting the sounds, and we shall imagine the second one in\r\nthe ear of the observer in the place of Corti's fibres, which is a model\r\nof such an instrument. To every string of the piano in the ear we will\r\nsuppose a special fibre of the auditory nerve attached, so that this\r\nfibre and this alone, is irritated when the string is thrown into\r\nvibration. If we strike now an accord on the external piano, for every\r\ntone of that accord a definite string of the internal piano will sound\r\nand as many different nervous fibres will be irritated as there are\r\nnotes in the accord. The simultaneous sense-impressions due to different\r\nnotes can thus be preserved unmingled and be separated by the attention.\r\nIt is the same as with the five fingers of the hand. With each finger I\r\ncan touch something different. Now the ear has three thousand such\r\nfingers, and each one is designed for the touching of a different\r\ntone.[9] Our ear is a puzzle-lock of the kind mentioned. It opens at the\r\nmagic melody of a sound. But it is a stupendously ingenious lock. Not\r\nonly one tone, but every tone makes it open; but each one differently.\r\nTo each tone it replies with a different sensation.\r\n\r\nMore than once it has happened in the history of science that a\r\nphenomenon predicted by theory, has not been brought within the range of\r\nactual observation until long afterwards. Leverrier predicted the\r\nexistence and the place of the planet Neptune, but it was not until\r\nsometime later that Galle actually found the planet at the predicted\r\nspot. Hamilton unfolded theoretically the phenomenon of the so-called\r\nconical refraction of light, but it was reserved for Lloyd some time\r\nsubsequently to observe the fact. The fortunes of Helmholtz's theory of\r\nCorti's fibres have been somewhat similar. This theory, too, received\r\nits substantial confirmation from the subsequent observations of V.\r\nHensen. On the free surface of the bodies of Crustacea, connected with\r\nthe auditory nerves, rows of little hairy filaments of varying lengths\r\nand thicknesses are found, which to some extent are the analogues of\r\nCorti's fibres. Hensen saw these hairs vibrate when sounds were excited,\r\nand when different notes were struck different hairs were set in\r\nvibration.\r\n\r\nI have compared the work of the physical inquirer to the journey of the\r\ntourist. When the tourist ascends a new hill he obtains of the whole\r\ndistrict a different view. When the inquirer has found the solution of\r\none enigma, the solution of a host of others falls into his hands.\r\n\r\nSurely you have often felt the strange impression experienced when in\r\nsinging through the scale the octave is reached, and nearly the same\r\nsensation is produced as by the fundamental tone. The phenomenon finds\r\nits explanation in the view here laid down of the ear. And not only this\r\nphenomenon but all the laws of the theory of harmony may be grasped and\r\nverified from this point of view with a clearness before undreamt of.\r\nUnfortunately, I must content myself to-day with the simple indication\r\nof these beautiful prospects. Their consideration would lead us too far\r\naside into the fields of other sciences.\r\n\r\nThe searcher of nature, too, must restrain himself in his path. He also\r\nis drawn along from one beauty to another as the tourist from dale to\r\ndale, and as circumstances generally draw men from one condition of life\r\ninto others. It is not he so much that makes the quests, as that the\r\nquests are made of him. Yet let him profit by his time, and let not his\r\nglance rove aimlessly hither and thither. For soon the evening sun will\r\nshine, and ere he has caught a full glimpse of the wonders close by, a\r\nmighty hand will seize him and lead him away into a different world of\r\npuzzles.\r\n\r\nRespected hearers, science once stood in an entirely different relation\r\nto poetry. The old Hindu mathematicians wrote their theorems in verses,\r\nand lotus-flowers, roses, and lilies, beautiful sceneries, lakes, and\r\nmountains figured in their problems.\r\n\r\n\"Thou goest forth on this lake in a boat. A lily juts forth, one palm\r\nabove the water. A breeze bends it downwards, and it vanishes two palms\r\nfrom its previous spot beneath the surface. Quick, mathematician, tell\r\nme how deep is the lake!\"\r\n\r\nThus spoke an ancient Hindu scholar. This poetry, and rightly, has\r\ndisappeared from science, but from its dry leaves another poetry is\r\nwafted aloft which cannot be described to him who has never felt it.\r\nWhoever will fully enjoy this poetry must put his hand to the plough,\r\nmust himself investigate. Therefore, enough of this! I shall reckon\r\nmyself fortunate if you do not repent of this brief excursion into the\r\nflowered dale of physiology, and if you take with yourselves the belief\r\nthat we can say of science what we say of poetry,\r\n\r\n    \"Who the song would understand,\r\n    Needs must seek the song's own land;\r\n    Who the minstrel understand\r\n    Needs must seek the minstrel's land.\"\r\n\r\n  FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 8: This experiment, with its associated reflexions, is due\r\n  to Galileo.]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 9: A development of the theory of musical audition\r\n  differing in many points from the theory of Helmholtz here\r\n  expounded, will be found in my _Contributions to the Analysis of the\r\n  Sensations_ (English translation by C. M. Williams), Chicago, The\r\n  Open Court Publishing Company, 1897.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE CAUSES OF HARMONY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are to speak to-day of a theme which is perhaps of somewhat more\r\ngeneral interest--_the causes of the harmony of musical sounds_. The\r\nfirst and simplest experiences relative to harmony are very ancient. Not\r\nso the explanation of its laws. These were first supplied by the\r\ninvestigators of a recent epoch. Allow me an historical retrospect.\r\n\r\nPythagoras (586 B. C.) knew that the note yielded by a string of steady\r\ntension was converted into its octave when the length of the string was\r\nreduced one-half, and into its fifth when reduced two-thirds; and that\r\nthen the first fundamental tone was consonant with the two others. He\r\nknew generally that the same string under fixed tension gives consonant\r\ntones when successively divided into lengths that are in the proportions\r\nof the simplest natural numbers; that is, in the proportions of 1:2,\r\n2:3, 3:4, 4:5.\r\n\r\nPythagoras failed to reveal the causes of these laws. What have\r\nconsonant tones to do with the simple natural numbers? That is the\r\nquestion we should ask to-day. But this circumstance must have appeared\r\nless strange than inexplicable to Pythagoras. This philosopher sought\r\nfor the causes of harmony in the occult, miraculous powers of numbers.\r\nHis procedure was largely the cause of the upgrowth of a numerical\r\nmysticism, of which the traces may still be detected in our\r\noneirocritical books and among some scientists, to whom marvels are more\r\nattractive than lucidity.\r\n\r\nEuclid (300 B. C.) gives a definition of consonance and dissonance that\r\ncould hardly be improved upon, in point of verbal accuracy. The\r\nconsonance ([Greek: symphônia]) of two tones, he says, is the mixture,\r\nthe blending ([Greek: krasis]) of those two tones; dissonance ([Greek:\r\ndiaphônia]), on the other hand, is the incapacity of the tones to blend\r\n([Greek: amixia]), whereby they are made harsh for the ear. The person\r\nwho knows the correct explanation of the phenomenon hears it, so to\r\nspeak, reverberated in these words of Euclid. Still, Euclid did not know\r\nthe true cause of harmony. He had unwittingly come very near to the\r\ntruth, but without really grasping it.\r\n\r\nLeibnitz (1646-1716 A. D.) resumed the question which his predecessors\r\nhad left unsolved. He, of course, knew that musical notes were produced\r\nby vibrations, that twice as many vibrations corresponded to the octave\r\nas to the fundamental tone, etc. A passionate lover of mathematics, he\r\nsought for the cause of harmony in the secret computation and comparison\r\nof the simple numbers of vibrations and in the secret satisfaction of\r\nthe soul at this occupation. But how, we ask, if one does not know that\r\nmusical notes are vibrations? The computation and the satisfaction at\r\nthe computation must indeed be pretty secret if it is unknown. What\r\nqueer ideas philosophers have! Could anything more wearisome be imagined\r\nthan computation as a principle of æsthetics? Yes, you are not utterly\r\nwrong in your conjecture, yet you may be sure that Leibnitz's theory is\r\nnot wholly nonsense, although it is difficult to make out precisely what\r\nhe meant by his secret computation.\r\n\r\nThe great Euler (1707-1783) sought the cause of harmony, almost as\r\nLeibnitz did, in the pleasure which the soul derives from the\r\ncontemplation of order in the numbers of the vibrations.[10]\r\n\r\nRameau and D'Alembert (1717-1783) approached nearer to the truth. They\r\nknew that in every sound available in music besides the fundamental note\r\nalso the twelfth and the next higher third could be heard; and further\r\nthat the resemblance between a fundamental tone and its octave was\r\nalways strongly marked. Accordingly, the combination of the octave,\r\nfifth, third, etc., with the fundamental tone appeared to them\r\n\"natural.\" They possessed, we must admit, the correct point of view; but\r\nwith the simple naturalness of a phenomenon no inquirer can rest\r\ncontent; for it is precisely this naturalness for which he seeks his\r\nexplanations.\r\n\r\nRameau's remark dragged along through the whole modern period, but\r\nwithout leading to the full discovery of the truth. Marx places it at\r\nthe head of his theory of composition, but makes no further application\r\nof it. Also Goethe and Zelter in their correspondence were, so to speak,\r\non the brink of the truth. Zelter knew of Rameau's view. Finally, you\r\nwill be appalled at the difficulty of the problem, when I tell you that\r\ntill very recent times even professors of physics were dumb when asked\r\nwhat were the causes of harmony.\r\n\r\nNot till quite recently did Helmholtz find the solution of the question.\r\nBut to make this solution clear to you I must first speak of some\r\nexperimental principles of physics and psychology.\r\n\r\n1) In every process of perception, in every observation, the attention\r\nplays a highly important part. We need not look about us long for proofs\r\nof this. You receive, for example, a letter written in a very poor hand.\r\nDo your best, you cannot make it out. You put together now these, now\r\nthose lines, yet you cannot construct from them a single intelligible\r\ncharacter. Not until you direct your attention to groups of lines which\r\nreally belong together, is the reading of the letter possible.\r\nManuscripts, the letters of which are formed of minute figures and\r\nscrolls, can only be read at a considerable distance, where the\r\nattention is no longer diverted from the significant outlines to the\r\ndetails. A beautiful example of this class is furnished by the famous\r\niconographs of Giuseppe Arcimboldo in the basement of the Belvedere\r\ngallery at Vienna. These are symbolic representations of water, fire,\r\netc.: human heads composed of aquatic animals and of combustibles. At a\r\nshort distance one sees only the details, at a greater distance only the\r\nwhole figure. Yet a point can be easily found at which, by a simple\r\nvoluntary movement of the attention, there is no difficulty in seeing\r\nnow the whole figure and now the smaller forms of which it is composed.\r\nA picture is often seen representing the tomb of Napoleon. The tomb is\r\nsurrounded by dark trees between which the bright heavens are visible as\r\nbackground. One can look a long time at this picture without noticing\r\nanything except the trees, but suddenly, on the attention being\r\naccidentally directed to the bright background, one sees the figure of\r\nNapoleon between the trees. This case shows us very distinctly the\r\nimportant part which attention plays. The same sensuous object can,\r\nsolely by the interposition of attention, give rise to wholly different\r\nperceptions.\r\n\r\nIf I strike a harmony, or chord, on this piano, by a mere effort of\r\nattention you can fix every tone of that harmony. You then hear most\r\ndistinctly the fixed tone, and all the rest appear as a mere addition,\r\naltering only the quality, or acoustic color, of the primary tone. The\r\neffect of the same harmony is essentially modified if we direct our\r\nattention to different tones.\r\n\r\nStrike in succession two harmonies, for example, the two represented in\r\nthe annexed diagram, and first fix by the attention the upper note _e_,\r\nafterwards the base _e_-_a_; in the two cases you will hear the same\r\nsequence of harmonies differently. In the first case, you have the\r\nimpression as if the fixed tone remained unchanged and simply altered\r\nits _timbre_; in the second case, the whole acoustic agglomeration seems\r\nto fall sensibly in depth. There is an art of composition to guide the\r\nattention of the hearer. But there is also an art of hearing, which is\r\nnot the gift of every person.\r\n\r\n[Music: Fig. 9.]\r\n\r\nThe piano-player knows the remarkable effects obtained when one of the\r\nkeys of a chord that is struck is let loose. Bar 1 played on the piano\r\nsounds almost like bar 2. The note which lies next to the key let loose\r\nresounds after its release as if it were freshly struck. The attention\r\nno longer occupied with the upper note is by that very fact insensibly\r\nled to the upper note.\r\n\r\n[Music: Fig. 10.]\r\n\r\nAny tolerably cultivated musical ear can perform the resolution of a\r\nharmony into its component parts. By much practice we can go even\r\nfurther. Then, every musical sound heretofore regarded as simple can be\r\nresolved into a subordinate succession of musical tones. For example, if\r\nI strike on the piano the note 1, (annexed diagram,) we shall hear, if\r\nwe make the requisite effort of attention, besides the loud fundamental\r\nnote the feebler, higher overtones, or harmonics, 2 ... 7, that is, the\r\noctave, the twelfth, the double octave, and the third, the fifth, and\r\nthe seventh of the double octave.\r\n\r\n[Music: Fig. 11.]\r\n\r\nThe same is true of every musically available sound. Each yields, with\r\nvarying degrees of intensity, besides its fundamental note, also the\r\noctave, the twelfth, the double octave, etc. The phenomenon is\r\nobservable with special facility on the open and closed flue-pipes of\r\norgans. According, now, as certain overtones are more or less distinctly\r\nemphasised in a sound, the _timbre_ of the sound changes--that peculiar\r\nquality of the sound by which we distinguish the music of the piano from\r\nthat of the violin, the clarinet, etc.\r\n\r\nOn the piano these overtones can be very easily rendered audible. If I\r\nstrike, for example, sharply note 1 of the foregoing series, whilst I\r\nsimply press down upon, one after another, the keys 2, 3, ... 7, the\r\nnotes 2, 3, ... 7 will continue to sound after the striking of 1,\r\nbecause the strings corresponding to these notes, now freed from their\r\ndampers, are thrown into sympathetic vibration.\r\n\r\nAs you know, this sympathetic vibration of the like-pitched strings with\r\nthe overtones is really not to be conceived as sympathy, but rather as\r\nlifeless mechanical necessity. We must not think of this sympathetic\r\nvibration as an ingenious journalist pictured it, who tells a gruesome\r\nstory of Beethoven's F minor sonata, Op. 2, that I cannot withhold from\r\nyou. \"At the last London Industrial Exhibition nineteen virtuosos played\r\nthe F minor sonata on the same piano. When the twentieth stepped up to\r\nthe instrument to play by way of variation the same production, to the\r\nterror of all present the piano began to render the sonata of its own\r\naccord. The Archbishop of Canterbury, who happened to be present, was\r\nset to work and forthwith expelled the F minor devil.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough, now, the overtones or harmonics which we have discussed are\r\nheard only upon a special effort of the attention, nevertheless they\r\nplay a highly important part in the formation of musical _timbre_, as\r\nalso in the production of the consonance and dissonance of sounds. This\r\nmay strike you as singular. How can a thing which is heard only under\r\nexceptional circumstances be of importance generally for audition?\r\n\r\nBut consider some familiar incidents of your every-day life. Think of\r\nhow many things you see which you do not notice, which never strike your\r\nattention until they are missing. A friend calls upon you; you cannot\r\nunderstand why he looks so changed. Not until you make a close\r\nexamination do you discover that his hair has been cut. It is not\r\ndifficult to tell the publisher of a work from its letter-press, and yet\r\nno one can state precisely the points by which this style of type is so\r\nstrikingly different from that style. I have often recognised a book\r\nwhich I was in search of from a simple piece of unprinted white paper\r\nthat peeped out from underneath the heap of books covering it, and yet I\r\nhad never carefully examined the paper, nor could I have stated its\r\ndifference from other papers.\r\n\r\nWhat we must remember, therefore, is that every sound that is musically\r\navailable yields, besides its fundamental note, its octave, its twelfth,\r\nits double octave, etc., as overtones or harmonics, and that these are\r\nimportant for the agreeable combination of several musical sounds.\r\n\r\n2) One other fact still remains to be dealt with. Look at this\r\ntuning-fork. It yields, when struck, a perfectly smooth tone. But if you\r\nstrike in company with it a second fork which is of slightly different\r\npitch, and which alone also gives a perfectly smooth tone, you will\r\nhear, if you set both forks on the table, or hold both before your ear,\r\na uniform tone no longer, but a number of shocks of tones. The rapidity\r\nof the shocks increases with the difference of the pitch of the forks.\r\nThese shocks, which become very disagreeable for the ear when they\r\namount to thirty-three in a second, are called \"beats.\"\r\n\r\nAlways, when one of two like musical sounds is thrown out of unison with\r\nthe other, beats arise. Their number increases with the divergence from\r\nunison, and simultaneously they grow more unpleasant. Their roughness\r\nreaches its maximum at about thirty-three beats in a second. On a still\r\nfurther departure from unison, and a consequent increase of the number\r\nof beats, the unpleasant effect is diminished, so that tones which are\r\nwidely apart in pitch no longer produce offensive beats.\r\n\r\nTo give yourselves a clear idea of the production of beats, take two\r\nmetronomes and set them almost alike. You can, for that matter, set the\r\ntwo exactly alike. You need not fear that they will strike alike. The\r\nmetronomes usually for sale in the shops are poor enough to yield, when\r\nset alike, appreciably unequal strokes. Set, now, these two metronomes,\r\nwhich strike at unequal intervals, in motion; you will readily see that\r\ntheir strokes alternately coincide and conflict with each other. The\r\nalternation is quicker the greater the difference of time of the two\r\nmetronomes.\r\n\r\nIf metronomes are not to be had, the experiment may be performed with\r\ntwo watches.\r\n\r\nBeats arise in the same way. The rhythmical shocks of two sounding\r\nbodies, of unequal pitch, sometimes coincide, sometimes interfere,\r\nwhereby they alternately augment and enfeeble each other's effects.\r\nHence the shock-like, unpleasant swelling of the tone.\r\n\r\nNow that we have made ourselves acquainted with overtones and beats, we\r\nmay proceed to the answer of our main question, Why do certain relations\r\nof pitch produce pleasant sounds, consonances, others unpleasant sounds,\r\ndissonances? It will be readily seen that all the unpleasant effects of\r\nsimultaneous sound-combinations are the result of beats produced by\r\nthose combinations. Beats are the only sin, the sole evil of music.\r\nConsonance is the coalescence of sounds without appreciable beats.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.]\r\n\r\nTo make this perfectly clear to you I have constructed the model which\r\nyou see in Fig. 12. It represents a claviatur. At its top a movable\r\nstrip of wood _aa_ with the marks 1, 2 ... 6 is placed. By setting this\r\nstrip in any position, for example, in that where the mark 1 is over the\r\nnote _c_ of the claviatur, the marks 2, 3 ... 6, as you see, stand over\r\nthe overtones of _c_. The same happens when the strip is placed in any\r\nother position. A second, exactly similar strip, _bb_, possesses the\r\nsame properties. Thus, together, the two strips, in any two positions,\r\npoint out by their marks all the tones brought into play upon the\r\nsimultaneous sounding of the notes indicated by the marks 1.\r\n\r\nThe two strips, placed over the same fundamental note, show that also\r\nall the overtones of those notes coincide. The first note is simply\r\nintensified by the other. The single overtones of a sound lie too far\r\napart to permit appreciable beats. The second sound supplies nothing\r\nnew, consequently, also, no new beats. Unison is the most perfect\r\nconsonance.\r\n\r\nMoving one of the two strips along the other is equivalent to a\r\ndeparture from unison. All the overtones of the one sound now fall\r\nalongside those of the other; beats are at once produced; the\r\ncombination of the tones becomes unpleasant: we obtain a dissonance. If\r\nwe move the strip further and further along, we shall find that as a\r\ngeneral rule the overtones always fall alongside each other, that is,\r\nalways produce beats and dissonances. Only in a few quite definite\r\npositions do the overtones partially coincide. Such positions,\r\ntherefore, signify higher degrees of euphony--they point out _the\r\nconsonant intervals_.\r\n\r\nThese consonant intervals can be readily found experimentally by cutting\r\nFig. 12 out of paper and moving _bb_ lengthwise along _aa_. The most\r\nperfect consonances are the octave and the twelfth, since in these two\r\ncases the overtones of the one sound coincide absolutely with those of\r\nthe other. In the octave, for example, 1_b_ falls on 2_a_, 2_b_ on 4_a_,\r\n3_b_ on 6_a_. Consonances, therefore, are simultaneous\r\nsound-combinations not accompanied by disagreeable beats. This, by the\r\nway, is, expressed in English, what Euclid said in Greek.\r\n\r\nOnly such sounds are consonant as possess in common some portion of\r\ntheir partial tones. Plainly we must recognise between such sounds, also\r\nwhen struck one after another, a certain affinity. For the second sound,\r\nby virtue of the common overtones, will produce partly the same\r\nsensation as the first. The octave is the most striking exemplification\r\nof this. When we reach the octave in the ascent of the scale we actually\r\nfancy we hear the fundamental tone repeated. The foundations of harmony,\r\ntherefore, are the foundations of melody.\r\n\r\nConsonance is the coalescence of sounds without appreciable beats! This\r\nprinciple is competent to introduce wonderful order and logic into the\r\ndoctrines of the fundamental bass. The compendiums of the theory of\r\nharmony which (Heaven be witness!) have stood hitherto little behind the\r\ncook-books in subtlety of logic, are rendered extraordinarily clear and\r\nsimple. And what is more, all that the great masters, such as\r\nPalestrina, Mozart, Beethoven, unconsciously got right, and of which\r\nheretofore no text-book could render just account, receives from the\r\npreceding principle its perfect verification.\r\n\r\nBut the beauty of the theory is, that it bears upon its face the stamp\r\nof truth. It is no phantom of the brain. Every musician can hear for\r\nhimself the beats which the overtones of his musical sounds produce.\r\nEvery musician can satisfy himself that for any given case the number\r\nand the harshness of the beats can be calculated beforehand, and that\r\nthey occur in exactly the measure that theory determines.\r\n\r\nThis is the answer which Helmholtz gave to the question of Pythagoras,\r\nso far as it can be explained with the means now at my command. A long\r\nperiod of time lies between the raising and the solving of this\r\nquestion. More than once were eminent inquirers nearer to the answer\r\nthan they dreamed of.\r\n\r\nThe inquirer seeks the truth. I do not know if the truth seeks the\r\ninquirer. But were that so, then the history of science would vividly\r\nremind us of that classical rendezvous, so often immortalised by\r\npainters and poets. A high garden wall. At the right a youth, at the\r\nleft a maiden. The youth sighs, the maiden sighs! Both wait. Neither\r\ndreams how near the other is.\r\n\r\nI like this simile. Truth suffers herself to be courted, but she has\r\nevidently no desire to be won. She flirts at times disgracefully. Above\r\nall, she is determined to be merited, and has naught but contempt for\r\nthe man who will win her too quickly. And if, forsooth, one breaks his\r\nhead in his efforts of conquest, what matter is it, another will come,\r\nand truth is always young. At times, indeed, it really seems as if she\r\nwere well disposed towards her admirer, but that admitted--never! Only\r\nwhen Truth is in exceptionally good spirits does she bestow upon her\r\nwooer a glance of encouragement. For, thinks Truth, if I do not do\r\nsomething, in the end the fellow will not seek me at all.\r\n\r\nThis one fragment of truth, then, we have, and it shall never escape us.\r\nBut when I reflect what it has cost in labor and in the lives of\r\nthinking men, how it painfully groped its way through centuries, a\r\nhalf-matured thought, before it became complete; when I reflect that it\r\nis the toil of more than two thousand years that speaks out of this\r\nunobtrusive model of mine, then, without dissimulation, I almost repent\r\nme of the jest I have made.\r\n\r\nAnd think of how much we still lack! When, several thousand years hence,\r\nboots, top-hats, hoops, pianos, and bass-viols are dug out of the earth,\r\nout of the newest alluvium as fossils of the nineteenth century; when\r\nthe scientists of that time shall pursue their studies both upon these\r\nwonderful structures and upon our modern Broadways, as we to-day make\r\nstudies of the implements of the stone age and of the prehistoric\r\nlake-dwellings--then, too, perhaps, people will be unable to comprehend\r\nhow we could come so near to many great truths without grasping them.\r\nAnd thus it is for all time the unsolved dissonance, for all time the\r\ntroublesome seventh, that everywhere resounds in our ears; we feel,\r\nperhaps, that it will find its solution, but we shall never live to see\r\nthe day of the pure triple accord, nor shall our remotest descendants.\r\n\r\nLadies, if it is the sweet purpose of your life to sow confusion, it is\r\nthe purpose of mine to be clear; and so I must confess to you a slight\r\ntransgression that I have been guilty of. On one point I have told you\r\nan untruth. But you will pardon me this falsehood, if in full repentance\r\nI make it good. The model represented in Fig. 12 does not tell the whole\r\ntruth, for it is based upon the so-called \"even temperament\" system of\r\ntuning. The overtones, however, of musical sounds are not tempered, but\r\npurely tuned. By means of this slight inexactness the model is made\r\nconsiderably simpler. In this form it is fully adequate for ordinary\r\npurposes, and no one who makes use of it in his studies need be in fear\r\nof appreciable error.\r\n\r\nIf you should demand of me, however, the full truth, I could give you\r\nthat only by the help of a mathematical formula. I should have to take\r\nthe chalk into my hands and--think of it!--reckon in your presence. This\r\nyou might take amiss. Nor shall it happen. I have resolved to do no more\r\nreckoning for to-day. I shall reckon now only upon your forbearance, and\r\nthis you will surely not gainsay me when you reflect that I have made\r\nonly a limited use of my privilege to weary you. I could have taken up\r\nmuch more of your time, and may, therefore, justly close with Lessing's\r\nepigram:\r\n\r\n    \"If thou hast found in all these pages naught that's worth the thanks,\r\n    At least have gratitude for what I've spared thee.\"\r\n\r\n  FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 10: Sauveur also set out from Leibnitz's idea, but arrived\r\n  by independent researches at a different theory, which was very near\r\n  to that of Helmholtz. Compare on this point Sauveur, _Mémoires de\r\n  l'Académie des Sciences_, Paris, 1700-1705, and R. Smith,\r\n  _Harmonics_, Cambridge, 1749. (See _Appendix_, p. 346.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VELOCITY OF LIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a criminal judge has a right crafty knave before him, one well\r\nversed in the arts of prevarication, his main object is to wring a\r\nconfession from the culprit by a few skilful questions. In almost a\r\nsimilar position the natural philosopher seems to be placed with respect\r\nto nature. True, his functions here are more those of the spy than the\r\njudge; but his object remains pretty much the same. Her hidden motives\r\nand laws of action is what nature must be made to confess. Whether a\r\nconfession will be extracted depends upon the shrewdness of the\r\ninquirer. Not without reason, therefore, did Lord Bacon call the\r\nexperimental method a questioning of nature. The art consists in so\r\nputting our questions that they may not remain unanswered without a\r\nbreach of etiquette.\r\n\r\nLook, too, at the countless tools, engines, and instruments of torture\r\nwith which man conducts his inquisitions of nature, and which mock the\r\npoet's words:\r\n\r\n    \"Mysterious even in open day,\r\n    Nature retains her veil, despite our clamors;\r\n    That which she doth not willingly display\r\n    Cannot be wrenched from her with levers, screws, and hammers.\"\r\n\r\nLook at these instruments and you will see that the comparison with\r\ntorture also is admissible.[11]\r\n\r\nThis view of nature, as of something designedly concealed from man, that\r\ncan be unveiled only by force or dishonesty, chimed in better with the\r\nconceptions of the ancients than with modern notions. A Grecian\r\nphilosopher once said, in offering his opinion of the natural science of\r\nhis time, that it could only be displeasing to the gods to see men\r\nendeavoring to spy out what the gods were not minded to reveal to\r\nthem.[12] Of course all the contemporaries of the speaker were not of\r\nhis opinion.\r\n\r\nTraces of this view may still be found to-day, but upon the whole we are\r\nnow not so narrow-minded. We believe no longer that nature designedly\r\nhides herself. We know now from the history of science that our\r\nquestions are sometimes meaningless, and that, therefore, no answer can\r\nbe forthcoming. Soon we shall see how man, with all his thoughts and\r\nquests, is only a fragment of nature's life.\r\n\r\nPicture, then, as your fancy dictates, the tools of the physicist as\r\ninstruments of torture or as engines of endearment, at all events a\r\nchapter from the history of those implements will be of interest to you,\r\nand it will not be unpleasant to learn what were the peculiar\r\ndifficulties that led to the invention of such strange apparatus.\r\n\r\nGalileo (born at Pisa in 1564, died at Arcetri in 1642) was the first\r\nwho asked what was the velocity of light, that is, what time it would\r\ntake for a light struck at one place to become visible at another, a\r\ncertain distance away.[13]\r\n\r\nThe method which Galileo devised was as simple as it was natural. Two\r\npractised observers, with muffled lanterns, were to take up positions in\r\na dark night at a considerable distance from each other, one at _A_ and\r\none at _B_. At a moment previously fixed upon, _A_ was instructed to\r\nunmask his lantern; while as soon as _B_ saw the light of _A_'s lantern\r\nhe was to unmask his. Now it is clear that the time which _A_ counted\r\nfrom the uncovering of his lantern until he caught sight of the light of\r\n_B_'s would be the time which it would take light to travel from _A_ to\r\n_B_ and from _B_ back to _A_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.]\r\n\r\nThe experiment was not executed, nor could it, in the nature of the\r\ncase, have been a success. As we now know, light travels too rapidly to\r\nbe thus noted. The time elapsing between the arrival of the light at _B_\r\nand its perception by the observer, with that between the decision to\r\nuncover and the uncovering of the lantern, is, as we now know,\r\nincomparably greater than the time which it takes light to travel the\r\ngreatest earthly distances. The great velocity of light will be made\r\napparent, if we reflect that a flash of lightning in the night\r\nilluminates instantaneously a very extensive region, whilst the single\r\nreflected claps of thunder arrive at the observer's ear very gradually\r\nand in appreciable succession.\r\n\r\nDuring his life, then, the efforts of Galileo to determine the velocity\r\nof light remained uncrowned with success. But the subsequent history of\r\nthe measurement of the velocity of light is intimately associated with\r\nhis name, for with the telescope which he constructed he discovered the\r\nfour satellites of Jupiter, and these furnished the next occasion for\r\nthe determination of the velocity of light.\r\n\r\nThe terrestrial spaces were too small for Galileo's experiment. The\r\nmeasurement was first executed when the spaces of the planetary system\r\nwere employed. Olaf Römer, (born at Aarhuus in 1644, died at Copenhagen\r\nin 1710) accomplished the feat (1675-1676), while watching with Cassini\r\nat the observatory of Paris the revolutions of Jupiter's moons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.]\r\n\r\nLet _AB_ (Fig. 14) be Jupiter's orbit. Let _S_ stand for the sun, _E_\r\nfor the earth, _J_ for Jupiter, and _T_ for Jupiter's first satellite.\r\nWhen the earth is at _E₁_ we see the satellite enter regularly into\r\nJupiter's shadow, and by watching the time between two successive\r\neclipses, can calculate its time of revolution. The time which Römer\r\nnoted was forty-two hours, twenty-eight minutes, and thirty-five\r\nseconds. Now, as the earth passes along in its orbit towards E₂, the\r\nrevolutions of the satellite grow apparently longer and longer: the\r\neclipses take place later and later. The greatest retardation of the\r\neclipse, which occurs when the earth is at _E₂_, amounts to sixteen\r\nminutes and twenty-six seconds. As the earth passes back again to _E₁_,\r\nthe revolutions grow apparently shorter, and they occur in exactly the\r\ntime that they first did when the earth arrives at _E₁_. It is to be\r\nremarked that Jupiter changes only very slightly its position during one\r\nrevolution of the earth. Römer guessed at once that these periodical\r\nchanges of the time of revolution of Jupiter's satellite were not\r\nactual, but apparent changes, which were in some way connected with the\r\nvelocity of light.\r\n\r\nLet us make this matter clear to ourselves by a simile. We receive\r\nregularly by the post, news of the political status at our capital.\r\nHowever far away we may be from the capital, we hear the news of every\r\nevent, later it is true, but of all equally late. The events reach us in\r\nthe same succession of time as that in which they took place. But if we\r\nare travelling away from the capital, every successive post will have a\r\ngreater distance to pass over, and the events will reach us more slowly\r\nthan they took place. The reverse will be the case if we are approaching\r\nthe capital.\r\n\r\nAt rest, we hear a piece of music played in the same _tempo_ at all\r\ndistances. But the _tempo_ will be seemingly accelerated if we are\r\ncarried rapidly towards the band, or retarded if we are carried rapidly\r\naway from it.[14]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.]\r\n\r\nPicture to yourself a cross, say the sails of a wind-mill (Fig. 15), in\r\nuniform rotation about its centre. Clearly, the rotation of the cross\r\nwill appear to you more slowly executed if you are carried very rapidly\r\naway from it. For the post which in this case conveys to you the light\r\nand brings to you the news of the successive positions of the cross will\r\nhave to travel in each successive instant over a longer path.\r\n\r\nNow this must also be the case with the rotation (the revolution) of the\r\nsatellite of Jupiter. The greatest retardation of the eclipse (16½\r\nminutes), due to the passage of the earth from _E₁_ to _E₂_, or to its\r\nremoval from Jupiter by a distance equal to the diameter of the orbit of\r\nthe earth, plainly corresponds to the time which it takes light to\r\ntraverse a distance equal to the diameter of the earth's orbit. The\r\nvelocity of light, that is, the distance described by light in a second,\r\nas determined by this calculation, is 311,000 kilometres,[15] or 193,000\r\nmiles. A subsequent correction of the diameter of the earth's orbit,\r\ngives, by the same method, the velocity of light as approximately\r\n186,000 miles a second.\r\n\r\nThe method is exactly that of Galileo; only better conditions are\r\nselected. Instead of a short terrestrial distance we have the diameter\r\nof the earth's orbit, three hundred and seven million kilometres; in\r\nplace of the uncovered and covered lanterns we have the satellite of\r\nJupiter, which alternately appears and disappears. Galileo, therefore,\r\nalthough he could not carry out himself the proposed measurement, found\r\nthe lantern by which it was ultimately executed.\r\n\r\nPhysicists did not long remain satisfied with this beautiful discovery.\r\nThey sought after easier methods of measuring the velocity of light,\r\nsuch as might be performed on the earth. This was possible after the\r\ndifficulties of the problem were clearly exposed. A measurement of the\r\nkind referred to was executed in 1849 by Fizeau (born at Paris in 1819).\r\n\r\nI shall endeavor to make the principle of Fizeau's apparatus clear to\r\nyou. Let _s_ (Fig. 16) be a disk free to rotate about its centre, and\r\nperforated at its rim with a series of holes. Let _l_ be a luminous\r\npoint casting its light on an unsilvered glass, _a_, inclined at an\r\nangle of forty-five degrees to the axis of the disk. The ray of light,\r\nreflected at this point, passes through one of the holes of the disk and\r\nfalls at right angles upon a mirror _b_, erected at a point about five\r\nmiles distant. From the mirror _b_ the light is again reflected, passes\r\nonce more through the hole in _s_, and, penetrating the glass plate,\r\nfinally strikes the eye, _o_, of the observer. The eye, _o_, thus, sees\r\nthe image of the luminous point _l_ through the glass plate and the hole\r\nof the disk in the mirror _b_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.]\r\n\r\nIf, now, the disk be set in rotation, the unpierced spaces between the\r\napertures will alternately take the place of the apertures, and the eye\r\no will now see the image of the luminous point in _b_ only at\r\ninterrupted intervals. On increasing the rapidity of the rotation,\r\nhowever, the interruptions for the eye become again unnoticeable, and\r\nthe eye sees the mirror _b_ uniformly illuminated.\r\n\r\nBut all this holds true only for relatively small velocities of the\r\ndisk, when the light sent through an aperture in _s_ to _b_ on its\r\nreturn strikes the aperture at almost the same place and passes through\r\nit a second time. Conceive, now, the speed of the disk to be so\r\nincreased that the light on its return finds before it an unpierced\r\nspace instead of an aperture, it will then no longer be able to reach\r\nthe eye. We then see the mirror _b_ only when no light is emitted from\r\nit, but only when light is sent to it; it is covered when light comes\r\nfrom it. In this case, accordingly, the mirror will always appear dark.\r\n\r\nIf the velocity of rotation at this point were still further increased,\r\nthe light sent through one aperture could not, of course, on its return\r\npass through the same aperture but might strike the next and reach the\r\neye by that. Hence, by constantly increasing the velocity of the\r\nrotation, the mirror _b_ may be made to appear alternately bright and\r\ndark. Plainly, now, if we know the number of apertures of the disk, the\r\nnumber of rotations per second, and the distance _sb_, we can calculate\r\nthe velocity of light. The result agrees with that obtained by Römer.\r\n\r\nThe experiment is not quite as simple as my exposition might lead you to\r\nbelieve. Care must be taken that the light shall travel back and forth\r\nover the miles of distance _sb_ and _bs_ undispersed. This difficulty\r\nis obviated by means of telescopes.\r\n\r\nIf we examine Fizeau's apparatus closely, we shall recognise in it an\r\nold acquaintance: the arrangement of Galileo's experiment. The luminous\r\npoint _l_ is the lantern _A_, while the rotation of the perforated disk\r\nperforms mechanically the uncovering and covering of the lantern.\r\nInstead of the unskilful observer _B_ we have the mirror _b_, which is\r\nunfailingly illuminated the instant the light arrives from _s_. The disk\r\n_s_, by alternately transmitting and intercepting the reflected light,\r\nassists the observer _o_. Galileo's experiment is here executed, so to\r\nspeak, countless times in a second, yet the total result admits of\r\nactual observation. If I might be pardoned the use of a phrase of\r\nDarwin's in this field, I should say that Fizeau's apparatus was the\r\ndescendant of Galileo's lantern.\r\n\r\nA still more refined and delicate method for the measurement of the\r\nvelocity of light was employed by Foucault, but a description of it here\r\nwould lead us too far from our subject.\r\n\r\nThe measurement of the velocity of sound is easily executed by the\r\nmethod of Galileo. It was unnecessary, therefore, for physicists to rack\r\ntheir brains further about the matter; but the idea which with light\r\ngrew out of necessity was applied also in this field. Koenig of Paris\r\nconstructs an apparatus for the measurement of the velocity of sound\r\nwhich is closely allied to the method of Fizeau.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus is very simple. It consists of two electrical clock-works\r\nwhich strike simultaneously, with perfect precision, tenths of seconds.\r\nIf we place the two clock-works directly side by side, we hear their\r\nstrokes simultaneously, wherever we stand. But if we take our stand by\r\nthe side of one of the works and place the other at some distance from\r\nus, in general a coincidence of the strokes will now not be heard. The\r\ncompanion strokes of the remote clock-work arrive, as sound, later. The\r\nfirst stroke of the remote work is heard, for example, immediately after\r\nthe first of the adjacent work, and so on. But by increasing the\r\ndistance we may produce again a coincidence of the strokes. For example,\r\nthe first stroke of the remote work coincides with the second of the\r\nnear work, the second of the remote work with the third of the near\r\nwork, and so on. If, now, the works strike tenths of seconds and the\r\ndistance between them is increased until the first coincidence is noted,\r\nplainly that distance is travelled over by the sound in a tenth of a\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nWe meet frequently the phenomenon here presented, that a thought which\r\ncenturies of slow and painful endeavor are necessary to produce, when\r\nonce developed, fairly thrives. It spreads and runs everywhere, even\r\nentering minds in which it could never have arisen. It simply cannot be\r\neradicated.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the velocity of light is not the only case in which\r\nthe direct perception of the senses is too slow and clumsy for use. The\r\nusual method of studying events too fleet for direct observation\r\nconsists in putting into reciprocal action with them other events\r\nalready known, the velocities of all of which are capable of comparison.\r\nThe result is usually unmistakable, and susceptible of direct inference\r\nrespecting the character of the event which is unknown. The velocity of\r\nelectricity cannot be determined by direct observation. But it was\r\nascertained by Wheatstone, simply by the expedient of watching an\r\nelectric spark in a mirror rotating with tremendous known velocity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.]\r\n\r\nIf we wave a staff irregularly hither and thither, simple observation\r\ncannot determine how quickly it moves at each point of its course. But\r\nlet us look at the staff through holes in the rim of a rapidly rotating\r\ndisk (Fig. 17). We shall then see the moving staff only in certain\r\npositions, namely, when a hole passes in front of the eye. The single\r\npictures of the staff remain for a time impressed upon the eye; we think\r\nwe see several staffs, having some such disposition as that represented\r\nin Fig. 18. If, now, the holes of the disk are equally far apart, and\r\nthe disk is rotated with uniform velocity, we see clearly that the staff\r\nhas moved slowly from _a_ to _b_, more quickly from _b_ to _c_, still\r\nmore quickly from _c_ to _d_, and with its greatest velocity from _d_ to\r\n_e_.\r\n\r\nA jet of water flowing from an orifice in the bottom of a vessel has the\r\nappearance of perfect quiet and uniformity, but if we illuminate it for\r\na second, in a dark room, by means of an electric flash we shall see\r\nthat the jet is composed of separate drops. By their quick descent the\r\nimages of the drops are obliterated and the jet appears uniform. Let us\r\nlook at the jet through the rotating disk. The disk is supposed to be\r\nrotated so rapidly that while the second aperture passes into the place\r\nof the first, drop 1 falls into the place of 2, 2 into the place of 3,\r\nand so on. We see drops then always in the same places. The jet appears\r\nto be at rest. If we turn the disk a trifle more slowly, then while the\r\nsecond aperture passes into the place of the first, drop 1 will have\r\nfallen somewhat lower than 2, 2 somewhat lower than 3, etc. Through\r\nevery successive aperture we shall see drops in successively lower\r\npositions. The jet will appear to be flowing slowly downwards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.]\r\n\r\nNow let us turn the disk more rapidly. Then while the second aperture is\r\npassing into the place of the first, drop 1 will not quite have reached\r\nthe place of 2, but will be found slightly above 2, 2 slightly above 3,\r\netc. Through the successive apertures we shall see the drops at\r\nsuccessively higher places. It will now look as if the jet were flowing\r\nupwards, as if the drops were rising from the lower vessel into the\r\nhigher.\r\n\r\nYou see, physics grows gradually more and more terrible. The physicist\r\nwill soon have it in his power to play the part of the famous lobster\r\nchained to the bottom of the Lake of Mohrin, whose direful mission, if\r\never liberated, the poet Kopisch humorously describes as that of a\r\nreversal of all the events of the world; the rafters of houses become\r\ntrees again, cows calves, honey flowers, chickens eggs, and the poet's\r\nown poem flows back into his inkstand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYou will now allow me the privilege of a few general remarks. You have\r\nseen that the same principle often lies at the basis of large classes of\r\napparatus designed for different purposes. Frequently it is some very\r\nunobtrusive idea which is productive of so much fruit and of such\r\nextensive transformations in physical technics. It is not otherwise here\r\nthan in practical life.\r\n\r\nThe wheel of a waggon appears to us a very simple and insignificant\r\ncreation. But its inventor was certainly a man of genius. The round\r\ntrunk of a tree perhaps first accidentally led to the observation of the\r\nease with which a load can be moved on a roller. Now, the step from a\r\nsimple supporting roller to a fixed roller, or wheel, appears a very\r\neasy one. At least it appears very easy to us who are accustomed from\r\nchildhood up to the action of the wheel. But if we put ourselves vividly\r\ninto the position of a man who never saw a wheel, but had to invent one,\r\nwe shall begin to have some idea of its difficulties. Indeed, it is\r\neven doubtful whether a single man could have accomplished this feat,\r\nwhether perhaps centuries were not necessary to form the first wheel\r\nfrom the primitive roller.[16]\r\n\r\nHistory does not name the progressive minds who constructed the first\r\nwheel; their time lies far back of the historic period. No scientific\r\nacademy crowned their efforts, no society of engineers elected them\r\nhonorary members. They still live only in the stupendous results which\r\nthey called forth. Take from us the wheel, and little will remain of the\r\narts and industries of modern life. All disappears. From the\r\nspinning-wheel to the spinning-mill, from the turning-lathe to the\r\nrolling-mill, from the wheelbarrow to the railway train, all vanishes.\r\n\r\nIn science the wheel is equally important. Whirling machines, as the\r\nsimplest means of obtaining quick motions with inconsiderable changes of\r\nplace, play a part in all branches of physics. You know Wheatstone's\r\nrotating mirror, Fizeau's wheel, Plateau's perforated rotating disks,\r\netc. Almost the same principle lies at the basis of all these apparatus.\r\nThey differ from one another no more than the pen-knife differs, in the\r\npurposes it serves, from the knife of the anatomist or the knife of the\r\nvine-dresser. Almost the same might be said of the screw.\r\n\r\nIt will now perhaps be clear to you that new thoughts do not spring up\r\nsuddenly. Thoughts need their time to ripen, grow, and develop in, like\r\nevery natural product; for man, with his thoughts, is also a part of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nSlowly, gradually, and laboriously one thought is transformed into a\r\ndifferent thought, as in all likelihood one animal species is gradually\r\ntransformed into new species. Many ideas arise simultaneously. They\r\nfight the battle for existence not otherwise than do the Ichthyosaurus,\r\nthe Brahman, and the horse.\r\n\r\nA few remain to spread rapidly over all fields of knowledge, to be\r\nredeveloped, to be again split up, to begin again the struggle from the\r\nstart. As many animal species long since conquered, the relicts of ages\r\npast, still live in remote regions where their enemies cannot reach\r\nthem, so also we find conquered ideas still living on in the minds of\r\nmany men. Whoever will look carefully into his own soul will acknowledge\r\nthat thoughts battle as obstinately for existence as animals. Who will\r\ngainsay that many vanquished modes of thought still haunt obscure\r\ncrannies of his brain, too faint-hearted to step out into the clear\r\nlight of reason? What inquirer does not know that the hardest battle, in\r\nthe transformation of his ideas, is fought with himself.\r\n\r\nSimilar phenomena meet the natural inquirer in all paths and in the most\r\ntrifling matters. The true inquirer seeks the truth everywhere, in his\r\ncountry-walks and on the streets of the great city. If he is not too\r\nlearned, he will observe that certain things, like ladies' hats, are\r\nconstantly subject to change. I have not pursued special studies on this\r\nsubject, but as long as I can remember, one form has always gradually\r\nchanged into another. First, they wore hats with long projecting rims,\r\nwithin which, scarcely accessible with a telescope, lay concealed the\r\nface of the beautiful wearer. The rim grew smaller and smaller; the\r\nbonnet shrank to the irony of a hat. Now a tremendous superstructure is\r\nbeginning to grow up in its place, and the gods only know what its\r\nlimits will be. It is not otherwise with ladies' hats than with\r\nbutterflies, whose multiplicity of form often simply comes from a slight\r\nexcrescence on the wing of one species developing in a cognate species\r\nto a tremendous fold. Nature, too, has its fashions, but they last\r\nthousands of years. I could elucidate this idea by many additional\r\nexamples; for instance, by the history of the evolution of the coat, if\r\nI were not fearful that my gossip might prove irksome to you.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have now wandered through an odd corner of the history of science.\r\nWhat have we learned? The solution of a small, I might almost say\r\ninsignificant, problem--the measurement of the velocity of light. And\r\nmore than two centuries have worked at its solution! Three of the most\r\neminent natural philosophers, Galileo, an Italian, Römer, a Dane, and\r\nFizeau, a Frenchman, have fairly shared its labors. And so it is with\r\ncountless other questions. When we contemplate thus the many blossoms of\r\nthought that must wither and fall before one shall bloom, then shall we\r\nfirst truly appreciate Christ's weighty but little consolatory words:\r\n\"Many be called but few are chosen.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the testimony of every page of history. But is history right?\r\nAre really only those chosen whom she names? Have those lived and\r\nbattled in vain, who have won no prize?\r\n\r\nI doubt it. And so will every one who has felt the pangs of sleepless\r\nnights spent in thought, at first fruitless, but in the end successful.\r\nNo thought in such struggles was thought in vain; each one, even the\r\nmost insignificant, nay, even the erroneous thought, that which\r\napparently was the least productive, served to prepare the way for those\r\nthat afterwards bore fruit. And as in the thought of the individual\r\nnaught is in vain, so, also, it is in that of humanity.\r\n\r\nGalileo wished to measure the velocity of light. He had to close his\r\neyes before his wish was realised. But he at least found the lantern by\r\nwhich his successor could accomplish the task.\r\n\r\nAnd so I may maintain that we all, so far as inclination goes, are\r\nworking at the civilisation of the future. If only we all strive for the\r\nright, then are we _all_ called and _all_ chosen!\r\n\r\n  FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 11: According to Mr. Jules Andrieu, the idea that nature\r\n  must be tortured to reveal her secrets is preserved in the name\r\n  _crucible_--from the Latin _crux_, a cross.

That the pretty symmetry of his face may not be\r\ndisturbed, the artist answers. That his second eye may furnish a\r\nsubstitute for his first if that be lost, says the far-sighted\r\neconomist. That we may weep with two eyes at the sins of the world,\r\nreplies the religious enthusiast.\r\n\r\nOdd opinions! Yet if you should approach a modern scientist with this\r\nquestion you might consider yourself fortunate if you escaped with less\r\nthan a rebuff. \"Pardon me, madam, or my dear sir,\" he would say, with\r\nstern expression, \"man fulfils no purpose in the possession of his eyes;\r\nnature is not a person, and consequently not so vulgar as to pursue\r\npurposes of any kind.\"\r\n\r\nStill an unsatisfactory answer! I once knew a professor who would shut\r\nwith horror the mouths of his pupils if they put to him such an\r\nunscientific question.\r\n\r\nBut ask a more tolerant person, ask me. I, I candidly confess, do not\r\nknow exactly why man has two eyes, but the reason partly is, I think,\r\nthat I may see you here before me to-night and talk with you upon this\r\ndelightful subject.\r\n\r\nAgain you smile incredulously. Now this is one of those questions that a\r\nhundred wise men together could not answer. You have heard, so far, only\r\nfive of these wise men. You will certainly want to be spared the\r\nopinions of the other ninety-five. To the first you will reply that we\r\nshould look just as pretty if we were born with only one eye, like the\r\nCyclops; to the second we should be much better off, according to his\r\nprinciple, if we had four or eight eyes, and that in this respect we are\r\nvastly inferior to spiders; to the third, that you are not just in the\r\nmood to weep; to the fourth, that the unqualified interdiction of the\r\nquestion excites rather than satisfies your curiosity; while of me you\r\nwill dispose by saying that my pleasure is not as intense as I think,\r\nand certainly not great enough to justify the existence of a double eye\r\nin man since the fall of Adam.\r\n\r\nBut since you are not satisfied with my brief and obvious answer, you\r\nhave only yourselves to blame for the consequences. You must now listen\r\nto a longer and more learned explanation, such as it is in my power to\r\ngive.\r\n\r\nAs the church of science, however, debars the question \"Why?\" let us put\r\nthe matter in a purely orthodox way: Man has two eyes, what _more_ can\r\nhe see with two than with one?\r\n\r\nI will invite you to take a walk with me? We see before us a wood. What\r\nis it that makes this real wood contrast so favorably with a painted\r\nwood, no matter how perfect the painting may be? What makes the one so\r\nmuch more lovely than the other? Is it the vividness of the coloring,\r\nthe distribution of the lights and the shadows? I think not. On the\r\ncontrary, it seems to me that in this respect painting can accomplish\r\nvery much.\r\n\r\nThe cunning hand of the painter can conjure up with a few strokes of his\r\nbrush forms of wonderful plasticity. By the help of other means even\r\nmore can be attained. Photographs of reliefs are so plastic that we\r\noften imagine we can actually lay hold of the elevations and\r\ndepressions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.]\r\n\r\nBut one thing the painter never can give with the vividness that nature\r\ndoes--the difference of near and far. In the real woods you see plainly\r\nthat you can lay hold of some trees, but that others are inaccessibly\r\nfar. The picture of the painter is rigid. The picture of the real woods\r\nchanges on the slightest movement. Now this branch is hidden behind\r\nthat; now that behind this. The trees are alternately visible and\r\ninvisible.\r\n\r\nLet us look at this matter a little more closely. For convenience sake\r\nwe shall remain upon the highway, I, II. (Fig. 20.) To the right and the\r\nleft lies the forest. Standing at I, we see, let us say, three trees (1,\r\n2, 3) in a line, so that the two remote ones are covered by the nearest.\r\nMoving further along, this changes. At II we shall not have to look\r\nround so far to see the remotest tree 3 as to see the nearer tree 2, nor\r\nso far to see this as to see 1. _Hence, as we move onward, objects that\r\nare near to us seem to lag behind as compared with objects that are\r\nremote from us, the lagging increasing with the proximity of the\r\nobjects._ Very remote objects, towards which we must always look in the\r\nsame direction as we proceed, appear to travel along with us.\r\n\r\nIf we should see, therefore, jutting above the brow of yonder hill the\r\ntops of two trees whose distance from us we were in doubt about, we\r\nshould have in our hands a very easy means of deciding the question. We\r\nshould take a few steps forward, say to the right, and the tree-top\r\nwhich receded most to the left would be the one nearer to us. In truth,\r\nfrom the amount of the recession a geometer could actually determine the\r\ndistance of the trees from us without ever going near them. It is simply\r\nthe scientific development of this perception that enables us to\r\nmeasure the distances of the stars.\r\n\r\n_Hence, from change of view in forward motion the distances of objects\r\nin our field of vision can be measured._\r\n\r\nRigorously, however, even forward motion is not necessary. For every\r\nobserver is composed really of _two_ observers. Man has _two_ eyes. The\r\nright eye is a short step ahead of the left eye in the right-hand\r\ndirection. Hence, the two eyes receive _different_ pictures of the same\r\nwoods. The right eye will see the near trees displaced to the left, and\r\nthe left eye will see them displaced to the right, the displacement\r\nbeing greater, the greater the proximity. This difference is sufficient\r\nfor forming ideas of distance.\r\n\r\nWe may now readily convince ourselves of the following facts:\r\n\r\n1. With one eye, the other being shut, you have a very uncertain\r\njudgment of distances. You will find it, for example, no easy task, with\r\none eye shut, to thrust a stick through a ring hung up before you; you\r\nwill miss the ring in almost every instance.\r\n\r\n2. You see the same object differently with the right eye from what you\r\ndo with the left.\r\n\r\nPlace a lamp-shade on the table in front of you with its broad opening\r\nturned downwards, and look at it from above. (Fig. 21.) You will see\r\nwith your right eye the image 2, with your left eye the image 1. Again,\r\nplace the shade with its wide opening turned upwards; you will receive\r\nwith your right eye the image 4, with your left eye the image 3. Euclid\r\nmentions phenomena of this character.\r\n\r\n3. Finally, you know that it is easy to judge of distances with both\r\neyes. Accordingly your judgment must spring in some way from a\r\nco-operation of the two eyes. In the preceding example the openings in\r\nthe different images received by the two eyes seem displaced with\r\nrespect to one another, and this displacement is sufficient for the\r\ninference that the one opening is nearer than the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.]\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that you, ladies, have frequently received delicate\r\ncompliments upon your eyes, but I feel sure that no one has ever told\r\nyou, and I know not whether it will flatter you, that you have in your\r\neyes, be they blue or black, little geometricians. You say you know\r\nnothing of them? Well, for that matter, neither do I. But the facts are\r\nas I tell you.\r\n\r\nYou understand little of geometry? I shall accept that confession. Yet\r\nwith the help of your two eyes you judge of distances? Surely that is a\r\ngeometrical problem. And what is more, you know the solution of this\r\nproblem: for you estimate distances correctly. If, then, _you_ do not\r\nsolve the problem, the little geometricians in your eyes must do it\r\nclandestinely and whisper the solution to you. I doubt not they are\r\nfleet little fellows.\r\n\r\nWhat amazes me most here is, that you know nothing about these little\r\ngeometricians. But perhaps they also know nothing about you. Perhaps\r\nthey are models of punctuality, routine clerks who bother about nothing\r\nbut their fixed work. In that case we may be able to deceive the\r\ngentlemen.\r\n\r\nIf we present to our right eye an image which looks exactly like the\r\nlamp-shade for the right eye, and to our left eye an image which looks\r\nexactly like a lamp-shade for the left eye, we shall imagine that we see\r\nthe whole lamp-shade bodily before us.\r\n\r\nYou know the experiment. If you are practised in squinting, you can\r\nperform it directly with the figure, looking with your right eye at the\r\nright image, and with your left eye at the left image. In this way the\r\nexperiment was first performed by Elliott. Improved and perfected, its\r\nform is Wheatstone's stereoscope, made so popular and useful by\r\nBrewster.\r\n\r\nBy taking two photographs of the same object from two different points,\r\ncorresponding to the two eyes, a very clear three-dimensional picture of\r\ndistant places or buildings can be produced by the stereoscope.\r\n\r\nBut the stereoscope accomplishes still more than this. It can visualise\r\nthings for us which we never see with equal clearness in real objects.\r\nYou know that if you move much while your photograph is being taken,\r\nyour picture will come out like that of a Hindu deity, with several\r\nheads or several arms, which, at the spaces where they overlap, show\r\nforth with equal distinctness, so that we seem to see the one picture\r\n_through_ the other. If a person moves quickly away from the camera\r\nbefore the impression is completed, the objects behind him will also be\r\nimprinted upon the photograph; the person will look transparent.\r\nPhotographic ghosts are made in this way.\r\n\r\nSome very useful applications may be made of this discovery. For\r\nexample, if we photograph a machine stereoscopically, successively\r\nremoving during the operation the single parts (where of course the\r\nimpression suffers interruptions), we obtain a transparent view, endowed\r\nwith all the marks of spatial solidity, in which is distinctly\r\nvisualised the interaction of parts normally concealed. I have employed\r\nthis method for obtaining transparent stereoscopic views of anatomical\r\nstructures.\r\n\r\nYou see, photography is making stupendous advances, and there is great\r\ndanger that in time some malicious artist will photograph his innocent\r\npatrons with solid views of their most secret thoughts and emotions. How\r\ntranquil politics will then be! What rich harvests our detective force\r\nwill reap!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy the joint action of the two eyes, therefore, we arrive at our\r\njudgments of distances, as also of the forms of bodies.\r\n\r\nPermit me to mention here a few additional facts connected with this\r\nsubject, which will assist us in the comprehension of certain phenomena\r\nin the history of civilisation.\r\n\r\nYou have often heard, and know from personal experience, that remote\r\nobjects appear perspectively dwarfed. In fact, it is easy to satisfy\r\nyourself that you can cover the image of a man a few feet away from you\r\nsimply by holding up your finger a short distance in front of your eye.\r\nStill, as a general rule, you do not notice this shrinkage of objects.\r\nOn the contrary, you imagine you see a man at the end of a large hall,\r\nas large as you see him near by you. For your eye, in its measurement of\r\nthe distances, makes remote objects correspondingly larger. The eye, so\r\nto speak, is aware of this perspective contraction and is not deceived\r\nby it, although its possessor is unconscious of the fact. All persons\r\nwho have attempted to draw from nature have vividly felt the difficulty\r\nwhich this superior dexterity of the eye causes the perspective\r\nconception. Not until one's judgment of distances is made uncertain, by\r\ntheir size, or from lack of points of reference, or from being too\r\nquickly changed, is the perspective rendered very prominent.\r\n\r\nOn sweeping round a curve on a rapidly moving railway train, where a\r\nwide prospect is suddenly opened up, the men upon distant hills appear\r\nlike dolls.[17] You have at the moment, here, no known references for\r\nthe measurement of distances. The stones at the entrance of a tunnel\r\ngrow visibly larger as we ride towards it; they shrink visibly in size\r\nas we ride from it.\r\n\r\nUsually both eyes work together. As certain views are frequently\r\nrepeated, and lead always to substantially the same judgments of\r\ndistances, the eyes in time must acquire a special skill in geometrical\r\nconstructions. In the end, undoubtedly, this skill is so increased that\r\na single eye alone is often tempted to exercise that office.\r\n\r\nPermit me to elucidate this point by an example. Is any sight more\r\nfamiliar to you than that of a vista down a long street? Who has not\r\nlooked with hopeful eyes time and again into a street and measured its\r\ndepth. I will take you now into an art-gallery where I will suppose you\r\nto see a picture representing a vista into a street. The artist has not\r\nspared his rulers to get his perspective perfect. The geometrician in\r\nyour left eye thinks, \"Ah ha! I have computed that case a hundred times\r\nor more. I know it by heart. It is a vista into a street,\" he continues;\r\n\"where the houses are lower is the remote end.\" The geometrician in the\r\nright eye, too much at his ease to question his possibly peevish comrade\r\nin the matter, answers the same. But the sense of duty of these punctual\r\nlittle fellows is at once rearoused. They set to work at their\r\ncalculations and immediately find that all the points of the picture are\r\nequally distant from them, that is, lie all upon a plane surface.\r\n\r\nWhat opinion will you now accept, the first or the second? If you accept\r\nthe first you will see distinctly the vista. If you accept the second\r\nyou will see nothing but a painted sheet of distorted images.\r\n\r\nIt seems to you a trifling matter to look at a picture and understand\r\nits perspective. Yet centuries elapsed before humanity came fully to\r\nappreciate this trifle, and even the majority of you first learned it\r\nfrom education.\r\n\r\nI can remember very distinctly that at three years of age all\r\nperspective drawings appeared to me as gross caricatures of objects. I\r\ncould not understand why artists made tables so broad at one end and so\r\nnarrow at the other. Real tables seemed to me just as broad at one end\r\nas at the other, because my eye made and interpreted its calculations\r\nwithout my intervention. But that the picture of the table on the plane\r\nsurface was not to be conceived as a plane painted surface but stood for\r\na table and so was to be imaged with all the attributes of extension was\r\na joke that I did not understand. But I have the consolation that whole\r\nnations have not understood it.\r\n\r\nIngenuous people there are who take the mock murders of the stage for\r\nreal murders, the dissembled actions of the players for real actions,\r\nand who can scarcely restrain themselves, when the characters of the\r\nplay are sorely pressed, from running in deep indignation to their\r\nassistance. Others, again, can never forget that the beautiful\r\nlandscapes of the stage are painted, that Richard III. is only the\r\nactor, Mr. Booth, whom they have met time and again at the clubs.\r\n\r\nBoth points of view are equally mistaken. To look at a drama or a\r\npicture properly one must understand that both are _shows_, simply\r\n_denoting_ something real. A certain preponderance of the intellectual\r\nlife over the sensuous life is requisite for such an achievement, where\r\nthe intellectual elements are safe from destruction by the direct\r\nsensuous impressions. A certain liberty in choosing one's point of view\r\nis necessary, a sort of humor, I might say, which is strongly wanting in\r\nchildren and in childlike peoples.\r\n\r\nLet us look at a few historical facts. I shall not take you as far back\r\nas the stone age, although we possess sketches from this epoch which\r\nshow very original ideas of perspective. But let us begin our\r\nsight-seeing in the tombs and ruined temples of ancient Egypt, where the\r\nnumberless reliefs and gorgeous colorings have defied the ravages of\r\nthousands of years.\r\n\r\nA rich and motley life is here opened to us. We find the Egyptians\r\nrepresented in all conditions of life. What at once strikes our\r\nattention in these pictures is the delicacy of their technical\r\nexecution. The contours are extremely exact and distinct. But on the\r\nother hand only a few bright colors are found, unblended and without\r\ntrace of transition. Shadows are totally wanting. The paint is laid on\r\nthe surfaces in equal thicknesses.\r\n\r\nShocking for the modern eye is the perspective. All the figures are\r\nequally large, with the exception of the king, whose form is unduly\r\nexaggerated. Near and far appear equally large. Perspective contraction\r\nis nowhere employed. A pond with water-fowl is represented flat, as if\r\nits surface were vertical.\r\n\r\nHuman figures are portrayed as they are never seen, the legs from the\r\nside, the face in profile. The breast lies in its full breadth across\r\nthe plane of representation. The heads of cattle appear in profile,\r\nwhile the horns lie in the plane of the drawing. The principle which the\r\nEgyptians followed might be best expressed by saying that their figures\r\nare pressed in the plane of the drawing as plants are pressed in a\r\nherbarium.\r\n\r\nThe matter is simply explained. If the Egyptians were accustomed to\r\nlooking at things ingenuously with both eyes at once, the construction\r\nof perspective pictures in space could not be familiar to them. They saw\r\nall arms, all legs on real men in their natural lengths. The figures\r\npressed into the planes resembled more closely, of course, in their eyes\r\nthe originals than perspective pictures could.\r\n\r\nThis will be better understood if we reflect that painting was developed\r\nfrom relief. The minor dissimilarities between the pressed figures and\r\nthe originals must gradually have compelled men to the adoption of\r\nperspective drawing. But physiologically the painting of the Egyptians\r\nis just as much justified as the drawings of our children are.\r\n\r\nA slight advance beyond the Egyptians is shown by the Assyrians. The\r\nreliefs rescued from the ruined mounds of Nimrod at Mossul are, upon the\r\nwhole, similar to the Egyptian reliefs. They were made known to us\r\nprincipally by Layard.\r\n\r\nPainting enters on a new phase among the Chinese. This people have a\r\nmarked feeling for perspective and correct shading, yet without being\r\nvery logical in the application of their principles. Here, too, it\r\nseems, they took the first step but did not go far. In harmony with this\r\nimmobility is their constitution, in which the muzzle and the bamboo-rod\r\nplay significant functions. In accord with it, too, is their language,\r\nwhich like the language of children has not yet developed into a\r\ngrammar, or, rather, according to the modern conception, has not yet\r\ndegenerated into a grammar. It is the same also with their music which\r\nis satisfied with the five-toned scale.\r\n\r\nThe mural paintings at Herculaneum and Pompeii are distinguished by\r\ngrace of representation, as also by a pronounced sense for perspective\r\nand correct illumination, yet they are not at all scrupulous in\r\nconstruction. Here still we find abbreviations avoided. But to offset\r\nthis defect, the members of the body are brought into unnatural\r\npositions, in which they appear in their full lengths. Abridgements are\r\nmore frequently observed in clothed than in unclothed figures.\r\n\r\nA satisfactory explanation of these phenomena first occurred to me on\r\nthe making of a few simple experiments which show how differently one\r\nmay see the same object, after some mastery of one's senses has been\r\nattained, simply by the arbitrary movement of the attention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.]\r\n\r\nLook at the annexed drawing (Fig. 22). It represents a folded sheet of\r\npaper with either its depressed or its elevated side turned towards you,\r\nas you wish. You can conceive the drawing in either sense, and in either\r\ncase it will appear to you differently.\r\n\r\nIf, now, you have a real folded sheet of paper on the table before you,\r\nwith its sharp edges turned towards you, you can, on looking at it with\r\none eye, see the sheet alternately elevated, as it really is, or\r\ndepressed. Here, however, a remarkable phenomenon is presented. When you\r\nsee the sheet properly, neither illumination nor form presents anything\r\nconspicuous. When you see it bent back you see it perspectively\r\ndistorted. Light and shadow appear much brighter or darker, or as if\r\noverlaid thickly with bright colors. Light and shadow now appear devoid\r\nof all cause. They no longer harmonise with the body's form, and are\r\nthus rendered much more prominent.\r\n\r\nIn common life we employ the perspective and illumination of objects to\r\ndetermine their forms and position. Hence we do not notice the lights,\r\nthe shadows, and the distortions. They first powerfully enter\r\nconsciousness when we employ a different construction from the usual\r\nspatial one. In looking at the planar image of a camera obscura we are\r\namazed at the plenitude of the light and the profundity of the shadows,\r\nboth of which we do not notice in real objects.\r\n\r\nIn my earliest youth the shadows and lights on pictures appeared to me\r\nas spots void of meaning. When I began to draw I regarded shading as a\r\nmere custom of artists. I once drew the portrait of our pastor, a friend\r\nof the family, and shaded, from no necessity, but simply from having\r\nseen something similar in other pictures, the whole half of his face\r\nblack. I was subjected for this to a severe criticism on the part of my\r\nmother, and my deeply offended artist's pride is probably the reason\r\nthat these facts remained so strongly impressed upon my memory.\r\n\r\nYou see, then, that many strange things, not only in the life of\r\nindividuals, but also in that of humanity, and in the history of general\r\ncivilisation, may be explained from the simple fact that man has two\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nChange man's eye and you change his conception of the world. We have\r\nobserved the truth of this fact among our nearest kin, the Egyptians,\r\nthe Chinese, and the lake-dwellers; how must it be among some of our\r\nremoter relatives,--with monkeys and other animals? Nature must appear\r\ntotally different to animals equipped with substantially different eyes\r\nfrom those of men, as, for example, to insects. But for the present\r\nscience must forego the pleasure of portraying this appearance, as we\r\nknow very little as yet of the mode of operation of these organs.\r\n\r\nIt is an enigma even how nature appears to animals closely related to\r\nman; as to birds, who see scarcely anything with two eyes at once, but\r\nsince their eyes are placed on opposite sides of their heads, have a\r\nseparate field of vision for each.[18]\r\n\r\nThe soul of man is pent up in the prison-house of his head; it looks at\r\nnature through its two windows, the eyes. It would also fain know how\r\nnature looks through other windows. A desire apparently never to be\r\nfulfilled. But our love for nature is inventive, and here, too, much has\r\nbeen accomplished.\r\n\r\nPlacing before me an angular mirror, consisting of two plane mirrors\r\nslightly inclined to each other, I see my face twice reflected. In the\r\nright-hand mirror I obtain a view of the right side, and in the\r\nleft-hand mirror a view of the left side, of my face. Also I shall see\r\nthe face of a person standing in front of me, more to the right with my\r\nright eye, more to the left with my left. But in order to obtain such\r\nwidely different views of a face as those shown in the angular mirror,\r\nmy two eyes would have to be set much further apart from each other than\r\nthey actually are.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.]\r\n\r\nSquinting with my right eye at the image in the right-hand mirror, with\r\nmy left eye at the image in the left-hand mirror, my vision will be the\r\nvision of a giant having an enormous head with his two eyes set far\r\napart. This, also, is the impression which my own face makes upon me. I\r\nsee it now, single and solid. Fixing my gaze, the relief from second to\r\nsecond is magnified, the eyebrows start forth prominently from above the\r\neyes, the nose seems to grow a foot in length, my mustache shoots forth\r\nlike a fountain from my lip, the teeth seem to retreat immeasurably. But\r\nby far the most horrible aspect of the phenomenon is the nose.\r\n\r\nInteresting in this connexion is the telestereoscope of Helmholtz. In\r\nthe telestereoscope we view a landscape by looking with our right eye\r\n(Fig. 24) through the mirror _a_ into the mirror _A_, and with our left\r\neye through the mirror _b_ into the mirror _B_. The mirrors _A_ and _B_\r\nstand far apart. Again we see with the widely separated eyes of a giant.\r\nEverything appears dwarfed and near us. The distant mountains look like\r\nmoss-covered stones at our feet. Between, you see the reduced model of a\r\ncity, a veritable Liliput. You are tempted almost to stroke with your\r\nhand the soft forest and city, did you not fear that you might prick\r\nyour fingers on the sharp, needle-shaped steeples, or that they might\r\ncrackle and break off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.]\r\n\r\nLiliput is no fable. We need only Swift's eyes, the telestereoscope, to\r\nsee it.\r\n\r\nPicture to yourself the reverse case. Let us suppose ourselves so small\r\nthat we could take long walks in a forest of moss, and that our eyes\r\nwere correspondingly near each other. The moss-fibres would appear like\r\ntrees. On them we should see strange, unshapely monsters creeping about.\r\nBranches of the oak-tree, at whose base our moss-forest lay, would seem\r\nto us dark, immovable, myriad-branched clouds, painted high on the vault\r\nof heaven; just as the inhabitants of Saturn, forsooth, might see their\r\nenormous ring. On the tree-trunks of our mossy woodland we should find\r\ncolossal globes several feet in diameter, brilliantly transparent,\r\nswayed by the winds with slow, peculiar motions. We should approach\r\ninquisitively and should find that these globes, in which here and there\r\nanimals were gaily sporting, were liquid globes, in fact that they were\r\nwater. A short, incautious step, the slightest contact, and woe betide\r\nus, our arm is irresistibly drawn by an invisible power into the\r\ninterior of the sphere and held there unrelentingly fast! A drop of dew\r\nhas engulfed in its capillary maw a manikin, in revenge for the\r\nthousands of drops that its big human counterparts have quaffed at\r\nbreakfast. Thou shouldst have known, thou pygmy natural scientist, that\r\nwith thy present puny bulk thou shouldst not joke with capillarity!\r\n\r\nMy terror at the accident brings me back to my senses. I see I have\r\nturned idyllic. You must pardon me. A patch of greensward, a moss or\r\nheather forest with its tiny inhabitants have incomparably more charms\r\nfor me than many a bit of literature with its apotheosis of human\r\ncharacter. If I had the gift of writing novels I should certainly not\r\nmake John and Mary my characters. Nor should I transfer my loving pair\r\nto the Nile, nor to the age of the old Egyptian Pharaohs, although\r\nperhaps I should choose that time in preference to the present. For I\r\nmust candidly confess that I hate the rubbish of history, interesting\r\nthough it may be as a mere phenomenon, because we cannot simply observe\r\nit but must also _feel_ it, because it comes to us mostly with\r\nsupercilious arrogance, mostly unvanquished. The hero of my novel would\r\nbe a cockchafer, venturing forth in his fifth year for the first time\r\nwith his newly grown wings into the light, free air. Truly it could do\r\nno harm if man would thus throw off his inherited and acquired\r\nnarrowness of mind by making himself acquainted with the world-view of\r\nallied creatures. He could not help gaining incomparably more in this\r\nway than the inhabitant of a small town would in circumnavigating the\r\nglobe and getting acquainted with the views of strange peoples.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have now conducted you, by many paths and by-ways, rapidly over hedge\r\nand ditch, to show you what wide vistas we may reach in every field by\r\nthe rigorous pursuit of a single scientific fact. A close examination of\r\nthe two eyes of man has conducted us not only into the dim recesses of\r\nhumanity's childhood, but has also carried us far beyond the bourne of\r\nhuman life.\r\n\r\nIt has surely often struck you as strange that the sciences are divided\r\ninto two great groups; that the so-called humanistic sciences, belonging\r\nto the so-called \"higher education,\" are placed in almost a hostile\r\nattitude to the natural sciences.\r\n\r\nI must confess I do not overmuch believe in this partition of the\r\nsciences. I believe that this view will appear as childlike and\r\ningenuous to a matured age as the want of perspective in the old\r\npaintings of Egypt does to us. Can it really be that \"higher culture\" is\r\nto be gotten only from a few old pots and palimpsests, which are at best\r\nmere scraps of nature, or that more is to be learned from them alone\r\nthan from all the rest of nature? I believe that both these sciences are\r\nsimply parts of the same science, which have begun at different ends. If\r\nthese two ends still act towards each other as the Montagues and\r\nCapulets, if their retainers still indulge in lively tilts, I believe\r\nthat after all they are not in earnest. On the one side there is surely\r\na Romeo, and on the other a Juliet, who, some day, it is hoped, will\r\nunite the two houses with a less tragic sequel than that of the play.\r\n\r\nPhilology began with the unqualified reverence and apotheosis of the\r\nGreeks. Now it has begun to draw other languages, other peoples and\r\ntheir histories, into its sphere; it has, through the mediation of\r\ncomparative linguistics, already struck up, though as yet somewhat\r\ncautiously, a friendship with physiology.\r\n\r\nPhysical science began in the witch's kitchen. It now embraces the\r\norganic and inorganic worlds, and with the physiology of articulation\r\nand the theory of the senses, has even pushed its researches, at times\r\nimpertinently, into the province of mental phenomena.\r\n\r\nIn short, we come to the understanding of much within us solely by\r\ndirecting our glance without, and _vice versa_. Every object belongs to\r\nboth sciences. You, ladies, are very interesting and difficult problems\r\nfor the psychologist, but you are also extremely pretty phenomena of\r\nnature. Church and State are objects of the historian's research, but\r\nnot less phenomena of nature, and in part, indeed, very curious\r\nphenomena. If the historical sciences have inaugurated wide extensions\r\nof view by presenting to us the thoughts of new and strange peoples, the\r\nphysical sciences in a certain sense do this in a still greater degree.\r\nIn making man disappear in the All, in annihilating him, so to speak,\r\nthey force him to take an unprejudiced position without himself, and to\r\nform his judgments by a different standard from that of the petty human.\r\n\r\nBut if you should ask me now why man has two eyes, I should answer:\r\n\r\nThat he may look at nature justly and accurately; that he may come to\r\nunderstand that he himself, with all his views, correct and incorrect,\r\nwith all his _haute politique_, is simply an evanescent shred of nature;\r\nthat, to speak with Mephistopheles, he is a part of the part, and that\r\nit is absolutely unjustified,\r\n\r\n    \"For man, the microcosmic fool, to see\r\n    Himself a whole so frequently.\"\r\n\r\n  FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 17: This effect is particularly noticeable in the size of\r\n  workmen on high chimneys and church-steeples--\"steeple Jacks.\" When\r\n  the cables were slung from the towers of the Brooklyn bridge (277\r\n  feet high), the men sent out in baskets to paint them, appeared,\r\n  against the broad background of heaven and water, like\r\n  flies.--_Trans._]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 18: See Joh. Müller, _Vergleichende Physiologie des\r\n  Gesichtssinnes_, Leipsic, 1826.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON SYMMETRY.[19]\r\n\r\n\r\nAn ancient philosopher once remarked that people who cudgelled their\r\nbrains about the nature of the moon reminded him of men who discussed\r\nthe laws and institutions of a distant city of which they had heard no\r\nmore than the name. The true philosopher, he said, should turn his\r\nglance within, should study himself and his notions of right and wrong;\r\nonly thence could he derive real profit.\r\n\r\nThis ancient formula for happiness might be restated in the familiar\r\nwords of the Psalm:\r\n\r\n    \"Dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.\"\r\n\r\nTo-day, if he could rise from the dead and walk about among us, this\r\nphilosopher would marvel much at the different turn which matters have\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nThe motions of the moon and the other heavenly bodies are accurately\r\nknown. Our knowledge of the motions of our own body is by far not so\r\ncomplete. The mountains and natural divisions of the moon have been\r\naccurately outlined on maps, but physiologists are just beginning to\r\nfind their way in the geography of the brain. The chemical constitution\r\nof many fixed stars has already been investigated. The chemical\r\nprocesses of the animal body are questions of much greater difficulty\r\nand complexity. We have our _Mécanique céleste_. But a _Mécanique\r\nsociale_ or a _Mécanique morale_ of equal trustworthiness remains to be\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\nOur philosopher would indeed admit that we have made great progress. But\r\nwe have not followed his advice. The patient has recovered, but he took\r\nfor his recovery exactly the opposite of what the doctor prescribed.\r\n\r\nHumanity is now returned, much wiser, from its journey in celestial\r\nspace, against which it was so solemnly warned. Men, after having become\r\nacquainted with the great and simple facts of the world without, are now\r\nbeginning to examine critically the world within. It sounds absurd, but\r\nit is true, that only after we have thought about the moon are we able\r\nto take up ourselves. It was necessary that we should acquire simple and\r\nclear ideas in a less complicated domain, before we entered the more\r\nintricate one of psychology, and with these ideas astronomy principally\r\nfurnished us.\r\n\r\nTo attempt any description of that stupendous movement, which,\r\noriginally springing out of the physical sciences, went beyond the\r\ndomain of physics and is now occupied with the problems of psychology,\r\nwould be presumptuous in this place. I shall only attempt here, to\r\nillustrate to you by a few simple examples the methods by which the\r\nprovince of psychology can be reached from the facts of the physical\r\nworld--especially the adjacent province of sense-perception. And I wish\r\nit to be remembered that my brief attempt is not to be taken as a\r\nmeasure of the present state of such scientific questions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that some objects please us, while others do\r\nnot. Generally speaking, anything that is constructed according to fixed\r\nand logically followed rules, is a product of tolerable beauty. We see\r\nthus nature herself, who always acts according to fixed rules,\r\nconstantly producing such pretty things. Every day the physicist is\r\nconfronted in his workshop with the most beautiful vibration-figures,\r\ntone-figures, phenomena of polarisation, and forms of diffraction.\r\n\r\nA rule always presupposes a repetition. Repetitions, therefore, will\r\nprobably be found to play some important part in the production of\r\nagreeable effects. Of course, the nature of agreeable effects is not\r\nexhausted by this. Furthermore, the repetition of a physical event\r\nbecomes the source of agreeable effects only when it is connected with\r\na repetition of sensations.\r\n\r\nAn excellent example that repetition of sensations is a source of\r\nagreeable effects is furnished by the copy-book of every schoolboy,\r\nwhich is usually a treasure-house of such things, and only in need of an\r\nAbbé Domenech to become celebrated. Any figure, no matter how crude or\r\npoor, if several times repeated, with the repetitions placed in line,\r\nwill produce a tolerable frieze.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.]\r\n\r\nAlso the pleasant effect of symmetry is due to the repetition of\r\nsensations. Let us abandon ourselves a moment to this thought, yet not\r\nimagine when we have developed it, that we have fully exhausted the\r\nnature of the agreeable, much less of the beautiful.\r\n\r\nFirst, let us get a clear conception of what symmetry is. And in\r\npreference to a definition let us take a living picture. You know that\r\nthe reflexion of an object in a mirror has a great likeness to the\r\nobject itself. All its proportions and outlines are the same. Yet there\r\nis a difference between the object and its reflexion in the mirror,\r\nwhich you will readily observe.\r\n\r\nHold your right hand before a mirror, and you will see in the mirror a\r\nleft hand. Your right glove will produce its mate in the glass. For you\r\ncould never use the reflexion of your right glove, if it were present to\r\nyou as a real thing, for covering your right hand, but only for covering\r\nyour left. Similarly, your right ear will give as its reflexion a left\r\near; and you will at once perceive that the left half of your body could\r\nvery easily be substituted for the reflexion of your right half. Now\r\njust as in the place of a missing right ear a left ear cannot be put,\r\nunless the lobule of the ear be turned upwards, or the opening into the\r\nconcha backwards, so, despite all similarity of form, the reflexion of\r\nan object can never take the place of the object itself.[20]\r\n\r\nThe reason of this difference between the object and its reflexion is\r\nsimple. The reflexion appears as far behind the mirror as the object is\r\nin front of it. The parts of the object, accordingly, which are nearest\r\nthe mirror will also be nearest the mirror in the reflexion.\r\nConsequently, the succession of the parts in the reflexion will be\r\nreversed, as may best be seen in the reflexion of the face of a watch or\r\nof a manuscript.\r\n\r\nIt will also be readily seen, that if a point of the object be joined\r\nwith its reflexion in the image, the line of junction will cut the\r\nmirror at right angles and be bisected by it. This holds true of all\r\ncorresponding points of object and image.\r\n\r\nIf, now, we can divide an object by a plane into two halves so that each\r\nhalf, as seen in the reflecting plane of division, is a reproduction of\r\nthe other half, such an object is termed symmetrical, and the plane of\r\ndivision is called the plane of symmetry.\r\n\r\nIf the plane of symmetry is vertical, we can say that the body is\r\nvertically symmetrical. An example of vertical symmetry is a Gothic\r\ncathedral.\r\n\r\nIf the plane of symmetry is horizontal, we can say that the object is\r\nhorizontally symmetrical. A landscape on the shores of a lake with its\r\nreflexion in the water, is a system of horizontal symmetry.\r\n\r\nExactly here is a noticeable difference. The vertical symmetry of a\r\nGothic cathedral strikes us at once, whereas we can travel up and down\r\nthe whole length of the Rhine or the Hudson without becoming aware of\r\nthe symmetry between objects and their reflexions in the water. Vertical\r\nsymmetry pleases us, whilst horizontal symmetry is indifferent, and is\r\nnoticed only by the experienced eye.\r\n\r\nWhence arises this difference? I say from the fact that vertical\r\nsymmetry produces a repetition of the same sensation, while horizontal\r\nsymmetry does not. I shall now show that this is so.\r\n\r\nLet us look at the following letters:\r\n\r\n  d b\r\n  q p\r\n\r\nIt is a fact known to all mothers and teachers, that children in their\r\nfirst attempts to read and write, constantly confound d and b, and q and\r\np, but never d and q, or b and p. Now d and b and q and p are the two\r\nhalves of a _vertically_ symmetrical figure, while d and q, and b and p\r\nare two halves of a _horizontally_ symmetrical figure. The first two are\r\nconfounded; but confusion is only possible of things that excite in us\r\nthe same or similar sensations.\r\n\r\nFigures of two flower-girls are frequently seen on the decorations of\r\ngardens and of drawing-rooms, one of whom carries a flower-basket in her\r\nright hand and the other a flower-basket in her left. All know how apt\r\nwe are, unless we are very careful, to confound these figures with one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nWhile turning a thing round from right to left is scarcely noticed, the\r\neye is not at all indifferent to the turning of a thing upside down. A\r\nhuman face which has been turned upside down is scarcely recognisable as\r\na face, and makes an impression which is altogether strange. The reason\r\nof this is not to be sought in the unwontedness of the sight, for it is\r\njust as difficult to recognise an arabesque that has been inverted,\r\nwhere there can be no question of a habit. This curious fact is the\r\nfoundation of the familiar jokes played with the portraits of unpopular\r\npersonages, which are so drawn that in the upright position of the page\r\nan exact picture of the person is presented, but on being inverted some\r\npopular animal is shown.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact, then, that the two halves of a vertically symmetrical\r\nfigure are easily confounded and that they therefore probably produce\r\nvery nearly the same sensations. The question, accordingly, arises,\r\n_why_ do the two halves of a vertically symmetrical figure produce the\r\nsame or similar sensations? The answer is: Because our apparatus of\r\nvision, which consists of our eyes and of the accompanying muscular\r\napparatus is itself vertically symmetrical.[21]\r\n\r\nWhatever external resemblances one eye may have with another they are\r\nstill not alike. The right eye of a man cannot take the place of a left\r\neye any more than a left ear or left hand can take the place of a right\r\none. By artificial means, we can change the part which each of our eyes\r\nplays. (Wheatstone's pseudoscope.) But we then find ourselves in an\r\nentirely new and strange world. What is convex appears concave; what is\r\nconcave, convex. What is distant appears near, and what is near appears\r\nfar.\r\n\r\nThe left eye is the reflexion of the right. And the light-feeling retina\r\nof the left eye is a reflexion of the light-feeling retina of the right,\r\nin all its functions.\r\n\r\nThe lense of the eye, like a magic lantern, casts images of objects on\r\nthe retina. And you may picture to yourself the light-feeling retina of\r\nthe eye, with its countless nerves, as a hand with innumerable fingers,\r\nadapted to feeling light. The ends of the visual nerves, like our\r\nfingers, are endowed with varying degrees of sensitiveness. The two\r\nretinæ act like a right and a left hand; the sensation of touch and the\r\nsensation of light in the two instances are similar.\r\n\r\nExamine the right-hand portion of this letter T: namely, T. Instead of\r\nthe two retinæ on which this image falls, imagine feeling the object, my\r\ntwo hands. The T, grasped with the right hand, gives a different\r\nsensation from that which it gives when grasped with the left. But if we\r\nturn our character about from right to left, thus: T, it will give the\r\nsame sensation in the left hand that it gave before in the right. The\r\nsensation is repeated.\r\n\r\nIf we take a whole T, the right half will produce in the right hand the\r\nsame sensation that the left half produces in the left, and _vice\r\nversa_.\r\n\r\nThe symmetrical figure gives the same sensation twice.\r\n\r\nIf we turn the T over thus: T, or invert the half T thus: L, so long as\r\nwe do not change the position of our hands we can make no use of the\r\nforegoing reasoning.\r\n\r\nThe retinæ, in fact, are exactly like our two hands. They, too, have\r\ntheir thumbs and index fingers, though they are thousands in number; and\r\nwe may say the thumbs are on the side of the eye near the nose, and the\r\nremaining fingers on the side away from the nose.\r\n\r\nWith this I hope to have made perfectly clear that the pleasing effect\r\nof symmetry is chiefly due to the repetition of sensations, and that\r\nthe effect in question takes place in symmetrical figures, only where\r\nthere is a repetition of sensation. The pleasing effect of regular\r\nfigures, the preference which straight lines, especially vertical and\r\nhorizontal straight lines, enjoy, is founded on a similar reason. A\r\nstraight line, both in a horizontal and in a vertical position, can cast\r\non the two retinæ the same image, which falls moreover on symmetrically\r\ncorresponding spots. This also, it would appear, is the reason of our\r\npsychological preference of straight to curved lines, and not their\r\nproperty of being the shortest distance between two points. The straight\r\nline is felt, to put the matter briefly, as symmetrical to itself, which\r\nis the case also with the plane. Curved lines are felt as deviations\r\nfrom straight lines, that is, as deviations from symmetry.[22] The\r\npresence of a sense for symmetry in people possessing only one eye from\r\nbirth, is indeed a riddle. Of course, the sense of symmetry, although\r\nprimarily acquired by means of the eyes, cannot be wholly limited to the\r\nvisual organs. It must also be deeply rooted in other parts of the\r\norganism by ages of practice and can thus not be eliminated forthwith by\r\nthe loss of one eye. Also, when an eye is lost, the symmetrical muscular\r\napparatus is left, as is also the symmetrical apparatus of innervation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt appears, however, unquestionable that the phenomena mentioned have,\r\nin the main, their origin in the peculiar structure of our eyes. It will\r\ntherefore be seen at once that our notions of what is beautiful and ugly\r\nwould undergo a change if our eyes were different. Also, if this view is\r\ncorrect, the theory of the so-called eternally beautiful is somewhat\r\nmistaken. It can scarcely be doubted that our culture, or form of\r\ncivilisation, which stamps upon the human body its unmistakable traces,\r\nshould not also modify our conceptions of the beautiful. Was not\r\nformerly the development of all musical beauty restricted to the narrow\r\nlimits of a five-toned scale?\r\n\r\nThe fact that a repetition of sensations is productive of pleasant\r\neffects is not restricted to the realm of the visible. To-day, both the\r\nmusician and the physicist know that the harmonic or the melodic\r\naddition of one tone to another affects us agreeably only when the added\r\ntone reproduces a part of the sensation which the first one excited.\r\nWhen I add an octave to a fundamental tone, I hear in the octave a part\r\nof what was heard in the fundamental tone. (Helmholtz.) But it is not my\r\npurpose to develop this idea fully here.[23] We shall only ask to-day,\r\nwhether there is anything similar to the symmetry of figures in the\r\nprovince of sounds.\r\n\r\nLook at the reflexion of your piano in the mirror.\r\n\r\nYou will at once remark that you have never seen such a piano in the\r\nactual world, for it has its high keys to the left and its low ones to\r\nthe right. Such pianos are not manufactured.\r\n\r\nIf you could sit down at such a piano and play in your usual manner,\r\nplainly every step which you imagined you were performing in the upward\r\nscale would be executed as a corresponding step in the downward scale.\r\nThe effect would be not a little surprising.\r\n\r\nFor the practised musician who is always accustomed to hearing certain\r\nsounds produced when certain keys are struck, it is quite an anomalous\r\nspectacle to watch a player in the glass and to observe that he always\r\ndoes the opposite of what we hear.\r\n\r\nBut still more remarkable would be the effect of attempting to strike a\r\nharmony on such a piano. For a melody it is not indifferent whether we\r\nexecute a step in an upward or a downward scale. But for a harmony, so\r\ngreat a difference is not produced by reversal. I always retain the same\r\nconsonance whether I add to a fundamental note an upper or a lower\r\nthird. Only the order of the intervals of the harmony is reversed. In\r\npoint of fact, when we execute a movement in a major key on our\r\nreflected piano, we hear a sound in a minor key, and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nIt now remains to execute the experiments indicated. Instead of playing\r\nupon the piano in the mirror, which is impossible, or of having a piano\r\nof this kind built, which would be somewhat expensive, we may perform\r\nour experiments in a simpler manner, as follows:\r\n\r\n1) We play on our own piano in our usual manner, look into the mirror,\r\nand then repeat on our real piano what we see in the mirror. In this way\r\nwe transform all steps upwards into corresponding steps downwards. We\r\nplay a movement, and then another movement, which, with respect to the\r\nkey-board, is symmetrical to the first.\r\n\r\n2) We place a mirror beneath the music in which the notes are reflected\r\nas in a body of water, and play according to the notes in the mirror. In\r\nthis way also, all steps upwards are changed into corresponding, equal\r\nsteps downwards.\r\n\r\n3) We turn the music upside down and read the notes from right to left\r\nand from below upwards. In doing this, we must regard all sharps as\r\nflats and all flats as sharps, because they correspond to half lines and\r\nspaces. Besides, in this use of the music we can only employ the bass\r\nclef, as only in this clef are the notes not changed by symmetrical\r\nreversal.\r\n\r\nYou can judge of the effect of these experiments from the examples which\r\nappear in the annexed musical cut. (Page 102.) The movement which\r\nappears in the upper lines is symmetrically reversed in the lower.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the experiments may be briefly formulated. The melody is\r\nrendered unrecognisable. The harmony suffers a transposition from a\r\nmajor into a minor key and _vice versa_. The study of these pretty\r\neffects, which have long been familiar to physicists and musicians, was\r\nrevived some years ago by Von Oettingen.[24]\r\n\r\n[Music: Fig. 26.\r\n\r\n(See pages 101 and 103.)]\r\n\r\nNow, although in all the preceding examples I have transposed steps\r\nupward into equal and similar steps downward, that is, as we may justly\r\nsay, have played for every movement the movement which is symmetrical to\r\nit, yet the ear notices either little or nothing of symmetry. The\r\ntransposition from a major to a minor key is the sole indication of\r\nsymmetry remaining. The symmetry is there for the mind, but is wanting\r\nfor sensation. No symmetry exists for the ear, because a reversal of\r\nmusical sounds conditions no repetition of sensations. If we had an ear\r\nfor height and an ear for depth, just as we have an eye for the right\r\nand an eye for the left, we should also find that symmetrical\r\nsound-structures existed for our auditory organs. The contrast of major\r\nand minor for the ear corresponds to inversion for the eye, which is\r\nalso only symmetry for the mind, but not for sensation.\r\n\r\nBy way of supplement to what I have said, I will add a brief remark for\r\nmy mathematical readers.\r\n\r\nOur musical notation is essentially a graphical representation of a\r\npiece of music in the form of curves, where the time is the abscissæ,\r\nand the logarithms of the number of vibrations the ordinates. The\r\ndeviations of musical notation from this principle are only such as\r\nfacilitate interpretation, or are due to historical accidents.\r\n\r\nIf, now, it be further observed that the sensation of pitch also is\r\nproportional to the logarithm of the number of vibrations, and that the\r\nintervals between the notes correspond to the differences of the\r\nlogarithms of the numbers of vibrations, the justification will be found\r\nin these facts of calling the harmonies and melodies which appear in the\r\nmirror, symmetrical to the original ones.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI simply wish to bring home to your minds by these fragmentary remarks\r\nthat the progress of the physical sciences has been of great help to\r\nthose branches of psychology that have not scorned to consider the\r\nresults of physical research. On the other hand, psychology is beginning\r\nto return, as it were, in a spirit of thankfulness, the powerful\r\nstimulus which it received from physics.\r\n\r\nThe theories of physics which reduce all phenomena to the motion and\r\nequilibrium of smallest particles, the so-called molecular theories,\r\nhave been gravely threatened by the progress of the theory of the senses\r\nand of space, and we may say that their days are numbered.\r\n\r\nI have shown elsewhere[25] that the musical scale is simply a species of\r\nspace--a space, however, of only one dimension, and that, a one-sided\r\none. If, now, a person who could only hear, should attempt to develop a\r\nconception of the world in this, his linear space, he would become\r\ninvolved in many difficulties, as his space would be incompetent to\r\ncomprehend the many sides of the relations of reality. But is it any\r\nmore justifiable for us, to attempt to force the whole world into the\r\nspace of our eye, in aspects in which it is not accessible to the eye?\r\nYet this is the dilemma of all molecular theories.\r\n\r\nWe possess, however, a sense, which, with respect to the scope of the\r\nrelations which it can comprehend, is richer than any other. It is our\r\nreason. This stands above the senses. It alone is competent to found a\r\npermanent and sufficient view of the world. The mechanical conception of\r\nthe world has performed wonders since Galileo's time. But it must now\r\nyield to a broader view of things. A further development of this idea is\r\nbeyond the limits of my present purpose.\r\n\r\nOne more point and I have done. The advice of our philosopher to\r\nrestrict ourselves to what is near at hand and useful in our researches,\r\nwhich finds a kind of exemplification in the present cry of inquirers\r\nfor limitation and division of labor, must not be too slavishly\r\nfollowed. In the seclusion of our closets, we often rack our brains in\r\nvain to fulfil a work, the means of accomplishing which lies before our\r\nvery doors. If the inquirer must be perforce a shoemaker, tapping\r\nconstantly at his last, it may perhaps be permitted him to be a\r\nshoemaker of the type of Hans Sachs, who did not deem it beneath him to\r\ntake a look now and then at his neighbor's work and to comment on the\r\nlatter's doings.\r\n\r\nLet this be my apology, therefore, if I have forsaken for a moment\r\nto-day the last of my specialty.\r\n\r\n  FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 19: Delivered before the German Casino of Prague, in the\r\n  winter of 1871.\r\n\r\n  A fuller treatment of the problems of this lecture will be found in\r\n  my _Contributions to the Analysis of the Sensations_ (Jena, 1886),\r\n  English Translation, Chicago, 1895. J. P. Soret, _Sur la perception\r\n  du beau_ (Geneva, 1892), also regards repetition as a principle of\r\n  æsthetics. His discussions of the _æsthetical_ side of the subject\r\n  are much more detailed than mine. But with respect to the\r\n  psychological and physiological foundation of the principle, I am\r\n  convinced that the _Contributions to the Analysis of the Sensations_\r\n  go deeper.--MACH (1894).]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 20: Kant, in his _Prolegomena zu jeder künftigen\r\n  Metaphysik_, also refers to this fact, but for a different purpose.]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 21: Compare Mach, _Fichte's Zeitschrift für Philosophie_,\r\n  1864, p. 1.]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 22: The fact that the first and second differential\r\n  coefficients of a curve are directly seen, but the higher\r\n  coefficients not, is very simply explained.

It would not be difficult, even within the brief\r\nlimits of an hour, to delight the eye with hosts of beautiful\r\nexperiments and to fill the imagination with numerous and varied\r\nconceptions. But we should, in such a case, be still far from a\r\nlucid and easy grasp of the phenomena. The means would still fail us\r\nfor reproducing the facts accurately in thought--a procedure which\r\nfor the theoretical and practical man is of equal importance. These\r\nmeans are the _metrical concepts_ of electricity.\r\n\r\nAs long as the pursuit of the facts of a given province of phenomena\r\nis in the hands of a few isolated investigators, as long as every\r\nexperiment can be easily repeated, the fixing of the collected facts\r\nby provisional description is ordinarily sufficient. But the case\r\nis different when the whole world must make use of the results\r\nreached by many, as happens when the science acquires broader\r\nfoundations and scope, and particularly so when it begins to supply\r\nintellectual nourishment to an important branch of the practical\r\narts, and to draw from that province in return stupendous empirical\r\nresults. Then the facts must be so described that individuals in all\r\nplaces and at all times can, from a few easily obtained elements,\r\nput the facts accurately together in thought, and reproduce them\r\nfrom the description. This is done with the help of the metrical\r\nconcepts and the international measures.\r\n\r\nThe work which was begun in this direction in the period of the\r\npurely scientific development of the science, especially by Coulomb\r\n(1784), Gauss (1833), and Weber (1846), was powerfully stimulated by\r\nthe requirements of the great technical undertakings manifested\r\nsince the laying of the first transatlantic cable, and brought to a\r\nbrilliant conclusion by the labors of the British Association, 1861,\r\nand of the Paris Congress, 1881, chiefly through the exertions of\r\nSir William Thomson.\r\n\r\nIt is plain, that in the time allotted to me I cannot conduct you\r\nover all the long and tortuous paths which the science has actually\r\npursued, that it will not be possible at every step to remind you of\r\nall the little precautions for the avoidance of error which the\r\nearly steps have taught us. On the contrary, I must make shift with\r\nthe simplest and rudest tools. I shall conduct you by the shortest\r\npaths from the facts to the ideas, in doing which, of course, it\r\nwill not be possible to anticipate all the stray and chance ideas\r\nwhich may and must arise from prospects into the by-paths which we\r\nleave untrodden.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere are two small, light bodies (Fig. 27) of equal size, freely\r\nsuspended, which we \"electrify\" either by friction with a third body\r\nor by contact with a body already electrified. At once a repulsive\r\nforce is set up which drives the two bodies away from each other in\r\nopposition to the action of gravity. This force could accomplish\r\nanew the same mechanical work which was expended to produce it.[27]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.]\r\n\r\nCoulomb, now, by means of delicate experiments with the\r\ntorsion-balance, satisfied himself that if the bodies in question,\r\nsay at a distance of two centimetres, repelled each other with the\r\nsame force with which a milligramme-weight strives to fall to the\r\nground, at half that distance, or at one centimetre, they would\r\nrepel each other with the force of four milligrammes, and at double\r\nthat distance, or at four centimetres, they would repel each other\r\nwith the force of only one-fourth of a milligramme. He found that\r\nthe electrical force acts inversely as the square of the distance.\r\n\r\nLet us imagine, now, that we possessed some means of measuring\r\nelectrical repulsion by weights, a means which would be supplied,\r\nfor example, by our electrical pendulums; then we could make the\r\nfollowing observation.\r\n\r\nThe body _A_ (Fig. 28) is repelled by the body _K_ at a distance of\r\ntwo centimetres with a force of one milligramme. If we touch _A_,\r\nnow, with an equal body _B_, the half of this force of repulsion\r\nwill pass to the body _B_; both _A_ and _B_, now, at a distance of\r\ntwo centimetres from _K_, are repelled only with the force of\r\none-half a milligramme. But both together are repelled still with\r\nthe force of one milligramme. Hence, _the divisibility of electrical\r\nforce_ among bodies in contact _is a fact_. It is a useful, but by\r\nno means a necessary supplement to this fact, to imagine an\r\nelectrical fluid present in the body _A_, with the quantity of which\r\nthe electrical force varies, and half of which flows over to _B_.\r\nFor, in the place of the new physical picture, thus, an old,\r\nfamiliar one is substituted, which moves spontaneously in its wonted\r\ncourses.\r\n\r\nAdhering to this idea, we define the _unit_ of electrical\r\nquantity, according to the now almost universally adopted\r\ncentimetre-gramme-second (C. G. S.) system, as that quantity which\r\nat a distance of one centimetre repels an equal quantity with unit\r\nof force, that is, with a force which in one second would impart to\r\na mass of one gramme a velocity-increment of a centimetre.\r\nAs a gramme mass acquires through the action of gravity a\r\nvelocity-increment of about 981 centimetres in a second,\r\naccordingly, a gramme is attracted to the earth with 981, or, in\r\nround numbers, 1000 units of force of the centimetre-gramme-second\r\nsystem, while a milligramme-weight would strive to fall to the earth\r\nwith approximately the unit force of this system.\r\n\r\nWe may easily obtain by this means a clear idea of what the unit\r\nquantity of electricity is. Two small bodies, _K_, weighing each a\r\ngramme, are hung up by vertical threads, five metres in length and\r\nalmost weightless, so as to touch each other. If the two bodies be\r\nequally electrified and move apart upon electrification to a\r\ndistance of one centimetre, their charge is approximately equivalent\r\nto the electrostatic unit of electric quantity, for the repulsion\r\nthen holds in equilibrium a gravitational force-component of\r\napproximately one milligramme, which strives to bring the bodies\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nVertically beneath a small sphere suspended from the equilibrated\r\nbeam of a balance a second sphere is placed at a distance of a\r\ncentimetre. If both be equally electrified the sphere suspended\r\nfrom the balance will be rendered apparently lighter by the\r\nrepulsion. If by adding a weight of one milligramme equilibrium is\r\nrestored, each of the spheres contains in round numbers the\r\nelectrostatic unit of electrical quantity.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that the same electrical bodies exert at\r\ndifferent distances different forces upon one another, exception\r\nmight be taken to the measure of quantity here developed. What kind\r\nof a quantity is that which now weighs more, and now weighs less, so\r\nto speak? But this apparent deviation from the method of\r\ndetermination commonly used in practical life, that by weight, is,\r\nclosely considered, an agreement. On a high mountain a heavy mass\r\nalso is less powerfully attracted to the earth than at the level of\r\nthe sea, and if it is permitted us in our determinations to neglect\r\nthe consideration of level, it is only because the comparison of a\r\nbody with fixed conventional weights is invariably effected at the\r\nsame level. In fact, if we were to make one of the two weights\r\nequilibrated on our balance approach sensibly to the centre of the\r\nearth, by suspending it from a very long thread, as Prof. von Jolly\r\nof Munich suggested, we should make the gravity of that weight, its\r\nheaviness, proportionately greater.\r\n\r\nLet us picture to ourselves, now, two different electrical fluids, a\r\npositive and a negative fluid, of such nature that the particles of\r\nthe one attract the particles of the other according to the law of\r\nthe inverse squares, but the particles of the same fluid repel each\r\nother by the same law; in non-electrical bodies let us imagine the\r\ntwo fluids uniformly distributed in equal quantities, in electric\r\nbodies one of the two in excess; in conductors, further, let us\r\nimagine the fluids mobile, in non-conductors immobile; having formed\r\nsuch pictures, we possess the conception which Coulomb developed and\r\nto which he gave mathematical precision. We have only to give this\r\nconception free play in our minds and we shall see as in a clear\r\npicture the fluid particles, say of a positively charged conductor,\r\nreceding from one another as far as they can, all making for the\r\nsurface of the conductor and there seeking out the prominent parts\r\nand points until the greatest possible amount of work has been\r\nperformed. On increasing the size of the surface, we see a\r\ndispersion, on decreasing its size we see a condensation of the\r\nparticles. In a second, non-electrified conductor brought into the\r\nvicinity of the first, we see the two fluids immediately separate,\r\nthe positive collecting itself on the remote and the negative on the\r\nadjacent side of its surface. In the fact that this conception\r\nreproduces, lucidly and spontaneously, all the data which arduous\r\nresearch only slowly and gradually discovered, is contained its\r\nadvantage and scientific value. With this, too, its value is\r\nexhausted. We must not seek in nature for the two hypothetical\r\nfluids which we have added as simple mental adjuncts, if we would\r\nnot go astray. Coulomb's view may be replaced by a totally\r\ndifferent one, for example, by that of Faraday, and the most proper\r\ncourse is always, after the general survey is obtained, to go back\r\nto the actual facts, to the electrical forces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.]\r\n\r\nWe will now make ourselves familiar with the concept of electrical\r\nquantity, and with the method of measuring or estimating it. Imagine\r\na common Leyden jar (Fig. 29), the inner and outer coatings of which\r\nare connected together by means of two common metallic knobs placed\r\nabout a centimetre apart. If the inside coating be charged with the\r\nquantity of electricity +_q_, on the outer coating a distribution of\r\nthe electricities will take place. A positive quantity almost\r\nequal[28] to the quantity +_q_ flows off to the earth, while a\r\ncorresponding quantity-_q_ is still left on the outer coating. The\r\nknobs of the jar receive their portion of these quantities and when\r\nthe quantity _q_ is sufficiently great a rupture of the insulating\r\nair between the knobs, accompanied by the self-discharge of the\r\njar, takes place. For any given distance and size of the knobs, a\r\ncharge of a definite electric quantity _q_ is always necessary for\r\nthe spontaneous discharge of the jar.\r\n\r\nLet us insulate, now, the outer coating of a Lane's unit jar _L_,\r\nthe jar just described, and put in connexion with it the inner\r\ncoating of a jar _F_ exteriorly connected with the earth (Fig. 30).\r\nEvery time that _L_ is charged with +_q_, a like quantity +_q_ is\r\ncollected on the inner coating of _F_, and the spontaneous discharge\r\nof the jar _L_, which is now again empty, takes place. The number of\r\nthe discharges of the jar _L_ furnishes us, thus, with a measure of\r\nthe quantity collected in the jar _F_, and if after 1, 2, 3, ...\r\nspontaneous discharges of _L_ the jar _F_ is discharged, it is\r\nevident that the charge of _F_ has been proportionately augmented.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.]\r\n\r\nLet us supply now, to effect the spontaneous discharge, the jar _F_\r\nwith knobs of the same size and at the same distance apart as those\r\nof the jar _L_ (Fig. 31). If we find, then, that five discharges of\r\nthe unit jar take place before one spontaneous discharge of the jar\r\n_F_ occurs, plainly the jar _F_, for equal distances between the\r\nknobs of the two jars, equal striking distances, is able to hold\r\nfive times the quantity of electricity that _L_ can, that is, has\r\nfive times the _capacity_ of _L_.[29]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.]\r\n\r\nWe will now replace the unit jar _L_, with which we measure\r\nelectricity, so to speak, _into_ the jar _F_, by a Franklin's pane,\r\nconsisting of two parallel flat metal plates (Fig. 32), separated\r\nonly by air. If here, for example, thirty spontaneous discharges of\r\nthe pane are sufficient to fill the jar, ten discharges will be\r\nfound sufficient if the air-space between the two plates be filled\r\nwith a cake of sulphur. Hence, the capacity of a Franklin's pane of\r\nsulphur is about three times greater than that of one of the same\r\nshape and size made of air, or, as it is the custom to say, the\r\nspecific inductive capacity of sulphur (that of air being taken as\r\nthe unit) is about 3.[30] We are here arrived at a very simple fact,\r\nwhich clearly shows us the significance of the number called\r\n_dielectric constant_, or _specific inductive capacity_, the\r\nknowledge of which is so important for the theory of submarine\r\ncables.\r\n\r\nLet us consider a jar _A_, which is charged with a certain quantity\r\nof electricity. We can discharge the jar directly. But we can also\r\ndischarge the jar _A_ (Fig. 33) partly into a jar _B_, by connecting\r\nthe two outer coatings with each other. In this operation a portion\r\nof the quantity of electricity passes, accompanied by sparks, into\r\nthe jar _B_, and we now find both jars charged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.]\r\n\r\nIt may be shown as follows that the conception of a constant\r\nquantity of electricity can be regarded as the expression of a pure\r\nfact. Picture to yourself any sort of electrical conductor (Fig.\r\n34); cut it up into a large number of small pieces, and place these\r\npieces by means of an insulated rod at a distance of one centimetre\r\nfrom an electrical body which acts with unit of force on an equal\r\nand like-constituted body at the same distance. Take the sum of the\r\nforces which this last body exerts on the single pieces of the\r\nconductor. The sum of these forces will be the quantity of\r\nelectricity on the whole conductor. It remains the same, whether we\r\nchange the form and the size of the conductor, or whether we bring\r\nit near or move it away from a second electrical conductor, so long\r\nas we keep it insulated, that is, do not discharge it.\r\n\r\nA basis of reality for the notion of electric quantity seems also to\r\npresent itself from another quarter. If a current, that is, in the\r\nusual view, a definite quantity of electricity per second, is sent\r\nthrough a column of acidulated water; in the direction of the\r\npositive stream, hydrogen, but in the opposite direction, oxygen is\r\nliberated at the extremities of the column. For a given quantity of\r\nelectricity a given quantity of oxygen appears. You may picture the\r\ncolumn of water as a column of hydrogen and a column of oxygen,\r\nfitted into each other, and may say the electric current is a\r\nchemical current and _vice versa_. Although this notion is more\r\ndifficult to adhere to in the field of statical electricity and with\r\nnon-decomposable conductors, its further development is by no means\r\nhopeless.\r\n\r\nThe concept quantity of electricity, thus, is not so aerial as might\r\nappear, but is able to conduct us with certainty through a multitude\r\nof varied phenomena, and is suggested to us by the facts in almost\r\npalpable form. We can collect electrical force in a body, measure it\r\nout with one body into another, carry it over from one body into\r\nanother, just as we can collect a liquid in a vessel, measure it out\r\nwith one vessel into another, or pour it from one into another.\r\n\r\nFor the analysis of mechanical phenomena, a metrical notion, derived\r\nfrom experience, and bearing the designation _work_, has proved\r\nitself useful. A machine can be set in motion only when the forces\r\nacting on it can perform work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.]\r\n\r\nLet us consider, for example, a wheel and axle (Fig. 35) having the\r\nradii 1 and 2 metres, loaded respectively with the weights 2 and 1\r\nkilogrammes. On turning the wheel and axle, the 1 kilogramme-weight,\r\nlet us say, sinks two metres, while the 2 kilogramme-weight rises\r\none metre. On both sides the product\r\n\r\nKGR. M. KGR. M.\r\n\r\n1 × 2 = 2 × 1.\r\n\r\nis equal. So long as this is so, the wheel and axle will not move of\r\nitself. But if we take such loads, or so change the radii of the\r\nwheels, that this product (kgr. × metre) on displacement is in\r\nexcess on one side, that side will sink. As we see, this product is\r\ncharacteristic for mechanical events, and for this reason has been\r\ninvested with a special name, _work_.\r\n\r\nIn all mechanical processes, and as all physical processes present a\r\nmechanical side, in all physical processes, work plays a\r\ndeterminative part. Electrical forces, also, produce only changes in\r\nwhich work is performed. To the extent that forces come into play in\r\nelectrical phenomena, electrical phenomena, be they what they may,\r\nextend into the domain of mechanics and are subject to the laws\r\nwhich hold in this domain. The universally adopted measure of work,\r\nnow, is the product of the force into the distance through which it\r\nacts, and in the C. G. S. system, the unit of work is the action\r\nthrough one centimetre of a force which would impart in one second\r\nto a gramme-mass a velocity-increment of one centimetre, that is, in\r\nround numbers, the action through a centimetre of a pressure equal\r\nto the weight of a milligramme. From a positively charged body,\r\nelectricity, yielding to the force of repulsion and performing work,\r\nflows off to the earth, providing conducting connexions exist. To a\r\nnegatively charged body, on the other hand, the earth under the\r\nsame circumstances gives off positive electricity. The electrical\r\nwork possible in the interaction of a body with the earth,\r\ncharacterises the electrical condition of that body. We will call\r\nthe work which must be expended on the unit quantity of positive\r\nelectricity to raise it from the earth to the body _K_ the\r\n_potential_ of the body _K_.[31]\r\n\r\nWe ascribe to the body _K_ in the C. G. S. system the potential +1,\r\nif we must expend the unit of work to raise the positive\r\nelectrostatic unit of electric quantity from the earth to that body;\r\nthe potential -1, if we gain in this procedure the unit of work; the\r\npotential 0, if no work at all is performed in the operation.\r\n\r\nThe different parts of one and the same electrical conductor in\r\nelectrical equilibrium have the same potential, for otherwise the\r\nelectricity would perform work and move about upon the conductor,\r\nand equilibrium would not have existed. Different conductors of\r\nequal potential, put in connexion with one another, do not exchange\r\nelectricity any more than bodies of equal temperature in contact\r\nexchange heat, or in connected vessels, in which the same pressures\r\nexist, liquids flow from one vessel to the other. Exchange of\r\nelectricity takes place only between conductors of different\r\npotentials, but in conductors of given form and position a definite\r\ndifference of potential is necessary for a spark, which pierces the\r\ninsulating air, to pass between them.\r\n\r\nOn being connected, every two conductors assume at once the same\r\npotential. With this the means is given of determining the potential\r\nof a conductor through the agency of a second conductor expressly\r\nadapted to the purpose called an electrometer, just as we determine\r\nthe temperature of a body with a thermometer. The values of the\r\npotentials of bodies obtained in this way simplify vastly our\r\nanalysis of their electrical behavior, as will be evident from what\r\nhas been said.\r\n\r\nThink of a positively charged conductor. Double all the electrical\r\nforces exerted by this conductor on a point charged with unit\r\nquantity, that is, double the quantity at each point, or what is the\r\nsame thing, double the total charge. Plainly, equilibrium still\r\nsubsists. But carry, now, the positive electrostatic unit towards\r\nthe conductor. Everywhere we shall have to overcome double the force\r\nof repulsion we did before, everywhere we shall have to expend\r\ndouble the work. By doubling the charge of the conductor a double\r\npotential has been produced. Charge and potential go hand in hand,\r\nare proportional. Consequently, calling the total quantity of\r\nelectricity of a conductor _Q_ and its potential _V_, we can write:\r\n_Q = CV_, where _C_ stands for a constant, the import of which will\r\nbe understood simply from noting that _C = Q/V_.[32] But the\r\ndivision of a number representing the units of quantity of a\r\nconductor by the number representing its units of potential tells us\r\nthe quantity which falls to the share of the unit of potential. Now\r\nthe number _C_ here we call the capacity of a conductor, and have\r\nsubstituted, thus, in the place of the old relative determination of\r\ncapacity, an absolute determination.[33]\r\n\r\nIn simple cases the connexion between charge, potential, and\r\ncapacity is easily ascertained. Our conductor, let us say, is a\r\nsphere of radius _r_, suspended free in a large body of air. There\r\nbeing no other conductors in the vicinity, the charge _q_ will then\r\ndistribute itself uniformly upon the surface of the sphere, and\r\nsimple geometrical considerations yield for its potential the\r\nexpression _V = q/r_. Hence, _q/V = r_; that is, the capacity of a\r\nsphere is measured by its radius, and in the C. G. S. system in\r\ncentimetres.[34] It is clear also, since a potential is a quantity\r\ndivided by a length, that a quantity divided by a potential must be\r\na length.\r\n\r\nImagine (Fig. 36) a jar composed of two concentric conductive\r\nspherical shells of the radii _r_ and _r₁_, having only air between\r\nthem. Connecting the outside sphere with the earth, and charging the\r\ninside sphere by means of a thin, insulated wire passing through the\r\nfirst, with the quantity _Q_, we shall have _V = (r₁-r)/(r₁r)Q_, and\r\nfor the capacity in this case _(r₁r)/(r₁-r)_, or, to take a specific\r\nexample, if _r = 16_ and _r₁ = 19_, a capacity of about 100\r\ncentimetres.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.]\r\n\r\nWe shall now use these simple cases for illustrating the principle\r\nby which capacity and potential are determined. First, it is clear\r\nthat we can use the jar composed of concentric spheres with its\r\nknown capacity as our unit jar and by means of this ascertain, in\r\nthe manner above laid down, the capacity of any given jar _F_. We\r\nfind, for example, that 37 discharges of this unit jar of the\r\ncapacity 100, just charges the jar investigated at the same\r\nstriking distance, that is, at the same potential. Hence, the\r\ncapacity of the jar investigated is 3700 centimetres. The large\r\nbattery of the Prague physical laboratory, which consists of sixteen\r\nsuch jars, all of nearly equal size, has a capacity, therefore, of\r\nsomething like 50,000 centimetres, or the capacity of a sphere, a\r\nkilometre in diameter, freely suspended in atmospheric space. This\r\nremark distinctly shows us the great superiority which Leyden jars\r\npossess for the storage of electricity as compared with common\r\nconductors. In fact, as Faraday pointed out, jars differ from simple\r\nconductors mainly by their great capacity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.]\r\n\r\nFor determining potential, imagine the inner coating of a jar _F_,\r\nthe outer coating of which communicates with the ground, connected\r\nby a long, thin wire with a conductive sphere _K_ placed free in a\r\nlarge atmospheric space, compared with whose dimensions the radius\r\nof the sphere vanishes. (Fig. 37.) The jar and the sphere assume at\r\nonce the same potential. But on the surface of the sphere, if that\r\nbe sufficiently far removed from all other conductors, a uniform\r\nlayer of electricity will be found. If the sphere, having the radius\r\n_r_, contains the charge _q_, its potential is _V = q/r_. If the\r\nupper half of the sphere be severed from the lower half and\r\nequilibrated on a balance with one of whose beams it is connected by\r\nsilk threads, the upper half will be repelled from the lower half\r\nwith the force _P = q²/8r² = 1/8V²_. This repulsion _P_ may be\r\ncounter-balanced by additional weights placed on the beam-end, and\r\nso ascertained. The potential is then _V = [sqrt](8P)_.[35]\r\n\r\nThat the potential is proportional to the square root of the force\r\nis not difficult to see. A doubling or trebling of the potential\r\nmeans that the charge of all the parts is doubled or trebled; hence\r\ntheir combined power of repulsion quadrupled or nonupled.\r\n\r\nLet us consider a special case. I wish to produce the potential 40\r\non the sphere. What additional weight must I give to the half sphere\r\nin grammes that the force of repulsion shall maintain the balance in\r\nexact equilibrium? As a gramme weight is approximately equivalent\r\nto 1000 units of force, we have only the following simple example to\r\nwork out: _40×40 = 8× 1000.x_, where _x_ stands for the number of\r\ngrammes. In round numbers we get _x_ = 0.2 gramme. I charge the jar.\r\nThe balance is deflected; I have reached, or rather passed, the\r\npotential 40, and you see when I discharge the jar the associated\r\nspark.[36]\r\n\r\nThe striking distance between the knobs of a machine increases with\r\nthe difference of the potential, although not proportionately to\r\nthat difference. The striking distance increases faster than the\r\npotential difference. For a distance between the knobs of one\r\ncentimetre on this machine the difference of potential is 110. It\r\ncan easily be increased tenfold. Of the tremendous differences of\r\npotential which occur in nature some idea may be obtained from the\r\nfact that the striking distances of lightning in thunder-storms is\r\ncounted by miles. The differences of potential in galvanic batteries\r\nare considerably smaller than those of our machine, for it takes\r\nfully one hundred elements to give a spark of microscopic striking\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe shall now employ the ideas reached to shed some light upon\r\nanother important relation between electrical and mechanical\r\nphenomena. We shall investigate what is the potential _energy_, or\r\nthe _store of work_, contained in a charged conductor, for example,\r\nin a jar.\r\n\r\nIf we bring a quantity of electricity up to a conductor, or, to\r\nspeak less pictorially, if we generate by work electrical force in a\r\nconductor, this force is able to produce anew the work by which it\r\nwas generated. How great, now, is the energy or capacity for work of\r\na conductor of known charge _Q_ and known potential _V_?\r\n\r\nImagine the given charge _Q_ divided into very small parts _q_,\r\n_q₁_, _q₂_ ..., and these little parts successively carried up to\r\nthe conductor. The first very small quantity _q_ is brought up\r\nwithout any appreciable work and produces by its presence a small\r\npotential _V__{'}. To bring up the second quantity, accordingly, we\r\nmust do the work _q__{'}_V__{'}, and similarly for the quantities\r\nwhich follow the work _q__{''}_V__{''}, _q__{'''}_V__{'''}, and so\r\nforth. Now, as the potential rises proportionately to the quantities\r\nadded until the value _V_ is reached, we have, agreeably to the\r\ngraphical representation of Fig. 38, for the total work performed,\r\n\r\n_W = 1/2QV_,\r\n\r\nwhich corresponds to the total energy of the charged conductor.\r\nUsing the equation _Q_ = _CV_, where _C_ stands for capacity, we\r\nalso have,\r\n\r\n_W = 1/2CV²_, or _W = Q²/2C_.\r\n\r\nIt will be helpful, perhaps, to elucidate this idea by an analogy\r\nfrom the province of mechanics. If we pump a quantity of liquid,\r\n_Q_, gradually into a cylindrical vessel (Fig. 39), the level of the\r\nliquid in the vessel will gradually rise. The more we have pumped\r\nin, the greater the pressure we must overcome, or the higher the\r\nlevel to which we must lift the liquid. The stored-up work is\r\nrendered again available when the heavy liquid _Q_, which reaches up\r\nto the level _h_, flows out. This work _W_ corresponds to the fall\r\nof the whole liquid weight _Q_, through the distance _h_/2 or\r\nthrough the altitude of its centre of gravity. We have\r\n\r\n_W = 1/2Qh_.\r\n\r\nFurther, since _Q_ = _Kh_, or since the weight of the liquid and the\r\nheight _h_ are proportional, we get also\r\n\r\n_W = 1/2Kh²_ and _W = Q²/2K_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39.]\r\n\r\nAs a special case let us consider our jar. Its capacity is _C_ =\r\n3700, its potential _V_ = 110; accordingly, its quantity _Q = CV_ =\r\n407,000 electrostatic units and its energy _W = 1/2QV_ = 22,385,000\r\nC. G. S. units of work.\r\n\r\nThe unit of work of the C. G. S. system is not readily appreciable\r\nby the senses, nor does it well admit of representation, as we are\r\naccustomed to work with weights. Let us adopt, therefore, as our\r\nunit of work the gramme-centimetre, or the gravitational pressure of\r\na gramme-weight through the distance of a centimetre, which in round\r\nnumbers is 1000 times greater than the unit assumed above; in this\r\ncase, our numerical result will be approximately 1000 times smaller.\r\nAgain, if we pass, as more familiar in practice, to the\r\nkilogramme-metre as our unit of work, our unit, the distance being\r\nincreased a hundred fold, and the weight a thousand fold, will be\r\n100,000 times larger. The numerical result expressing the work done\r\nis in this case 100,000 times less, being in round numbers 0.22\r\nkilogramme-metre. We can obtain a clear idea of the work done here\r\nby letting a kilogramme-weight fall 22 centimetres.\r\n\r\nThis amount of work, accordingly, is performed on the charging of\r\nthe jar, and on its discharge appears again, according to the\r\ncircumstances, partly as sound, partly as a mechanical disruption of\r\ninsulators, partly as light and heat, and so forth.\r\n\r\nThe large battery of the Prague physical laboratory, with its\r\nsixteen jars charged to equal potentials, furnishes, although the\r\neffect of the discharge is imposing, a total amount of work of only\r\nthree kilogramme-metres.\r\n\r\nIn the development of the ideas above laid down we are not\r\nrestricted to the method there pursued; in fact, that method was\r\nselected only as one especially fitted to familiarise us with the\r\nphenomena. On the contrary, the connexion of the physical processes\r\nis so multifarious that we can come at the same event from very\r\ndifferent directions. Particularly are electrical phenomena\r\nconnected with all other physical events; and so intimate is this\r\nconnexion that we might justly call the study of electricity the\r\ntheory of the general connexion of physical processes.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the principle of the conservation of energy which\r\nunites electrical with mechanical phenomena, I should like to point\r\nout briefly two ways of following up the study of this connexion.\r\n\r\nA few years ago Professor Rosetti, taking an influence-machine,\r\nwhich he set in motion by means of weights alternately in the\r\nelectrical and non-electrical condition with the same velocities,\r\ndetermined the mechanical work expended in the two cases and was\r\nthus enabled, after deducting the work of friction, to ascertain the\r\nmechanical work consumed in the development of the electricity.\r\n\r\nI myself have made this experiment in a modified, and, as I think,\r\nmore advantageous form. Instead of determining the work of friction\r\nby special trial, I arranged my apparatus so that it was eliminated\r\nof itself in the measurement and could consequently be neglected.\r\nThe so-called fixed disk of the machine, the axis of which is\r\nplaced vertically, is suspended somewhat like a chandelier by three\r\nvertical threads of equal lengths _l_ at a distance _r_ from the\r\naxis. Only when the machine is excited does this fixed disk, which\r\nrepresents a Prony's brake, receive, through its reciprocal action\r\nwith the rotating disk, a deflexion _[alpha]_ and a moment of\r\ntorsion which is expressed by _D = (Pr²/l)[alpha]_, where _P_ is the\r\nweight of the disk.[37] The angle _[alpha]_ is determined by a\r\nmirror set in the disk. The work expended in _n_ rotations is given\r\nby _2n[pi]D_.\r\n\r\nIf we close the machine, as Rosetti did, we obtain a continuous\r\ncurrent which has all the properties of a very weak galvanic\r\ncurrent; for example, it produces a deflexion in a multiplier which\r\nwe interpose, and so forth. We can directly ascertain, now, the\r\nmechanical work expended in the maintenance of this current.\r\n\r\nIf we charge a jar by means of a machine, the energy of the jar\r\nemployed in the production of sparks, in the disruption of the\r\ninsulators, etc., corresponds to a part only of the mechanical work\r\nexpended, a second part of it being consumed in the arc which forms\r\nthe circuit.[38] This machine, with the interposed jar, affords in\r\nminiature a picture of the transference of force, or more properly\r\nof work. And in fact nearly the same laws hold here for the\r\neconomical coefficient as obtain for large dynamo-machines.\r\n\r\nAnother means of investigating electrical energy is by its\r\ntransformation into heat. A long time ago (1838), before the\r\nmechanical theory of heat had attained its present popularity, Riess\r\nperformed experiments in this field with the help of his electrical\r\nair-thermometer or thermo-electrometer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.]\r\n\r\nIf the discharge be conducted through a fine wire passing through\r\nthe globe of the air-thermometer, a development of heat is observed\r\nproportional to the expression above-discussed _W = 1/2QV_. Although\r\nthe total energy has not yet been transformed into measurable heat\r\nby this means, in as much as a portion is left behind in the spark\r\nin the air outside the thermometer, still everything tends to show\r\nthat the total heat developed in all parts of the conductor and\r\nalong all the paths of discharge is the equivalent of the work\r\n1/2_QV_.\r\n\r\nIt is not important here whether the electrical energy is\r\ntransformed all at once or partly, by degrees. For example, if of\r\ntwo equal jars one is charged with the quantity _Q_ at the potential\r\n_V_ the energy present is 1/2_QV_. If the first jar be discharged\r\ninto the second, _V_, since the capacity is now doubled, falls to\r\n_V_/2. Accordingly, the energy 1/4_QV_ remains, while 1/4_QV_ is\r\ntransformed in the spark of discharge into heat. The remainder,\r\nhowever, is equally distributed between the two jars so that each on\r\ndischarge is still able to transform 1/8_QV_ into heat.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have here discussed electricity in the limited phenomenal form in\r\nwhich it was known to the inquirers before Volta, and which has been\r\ncalled, perhaps not very felicitously, \"statical electricity.\" It is\r\nevident, however, that the nature of electricity is everywhere one\r\nand the same; that a substantial difference between statical and\r\ngalvanic electricity does not exist. Only the quantitative\r\ncircumstances in the two provinces are so widely different that\r\ntotally new aspects of phenomena may appear in the second, for\r\nexample, magnetic effects, which in the first remained unnoticed,\r\nwhilst, _vice versa_, in the second field statical attractions and\r\nrepulsions are scarcely appreciable. As a fact, we can easily\r\nshow the magnetic effect of the current of discharge of an\r\ninfluence-machine on the galvanoscope although we could hardly have\r\nmade the original discovery of the magnetic effects with this\r\ncurrent. The statical distant action of the wire poles of a galvanic\r\nelement also would hardly have been noticed had not the phenomenon\r\nbeen known from a different quarter in a striking form.\r\n\r\nIf we wished to characterise the two fields in their chief and most\r\ngeneral features, we should say that in the first, high potentials\r\nand small quantities come into play, in the second small potentials\r\nand large quantities. A jar which is discharging and a galvanic\r\nelement deport themselves somewhat like an air-gun and the bellows\r\nof an organ. The first gives forth suddenly under a very high\r\npressure a small quantity of air; the latter liberates gradually\r\nunder a very slight pressure a large quantity of air.\r\n\r\nIn point of principle, too, nothing prevents our retaining the\r\nelectrostatical units in the domain of galvanic electricity and in\r\nmeasuring, for example, the strength of a current by the number of\r\nelectrostatic units which flow per second through its cross-section.\r\nBut this would be in a double aspect impractical. In the first\r\nplace, we should totally neglect the magnetic facilities for\r\nmeasurement so conveniently offered by the current, and substitute\r\nfor this easy means a method which can be applied only with\r\ndifficulty and is not capable of great exactness. In the second\r\nplace our units would be much too small, and we should find\r\nourselves in the predicament of the astronomer who attempted to\r\nmeasure celestial distances in metres instead of in radii of the\r\nearth and the earth's orbit; for the current which by the magnetic\r\nC. G. S. standard represents the unit, would require a flow of some\r\n30,000,000,000 electrostatic units per second through its\r\ncross-section. Accordingly, different units must be adopted here.\r\nThe development of this point, however, lies beyond my present\r\ntask.\r\n\r\n  FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 26: A lecture delivered at the International Electrical\r\n  Exhibition, in Vienna, on September 4, 1883.]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 27: If the two bodies were oppositely electrified they\r\n  would exert attractions upon each other.]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 28: The quantity which flows off is in point of fact less\r\n  than _q_. It would be equal to the quantity _q_ only if the inner\r\n  coating of the jar were wholly encompassed by the outer coating.]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 29: Rigorously, of course, this is not correct. First, it\r\n  is to be noted that the jar _L_ is discharged simultaneously with\r\n  the electrode of the machine. The jar _F_, on the other hand, is\r\n  always discharged simultaneously with the outer coating of the jar\r\n  _L_. Hence, if we call the capacity of the electrode of the machine\r\n  _E_, that of the unit jar _L_, that of the outer coating of _L_,\r\n  _A_, and that of the principal jar _F_, then this equation would\r\n  exist for the example in the text: _(F + A)/(L + E) = 5_. A cause of\r\n  further departure from absolute exactness is the residual charge.]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 30: Making allowance for the corrections indicated in the\r\n  preceding footnote, I have obtained for the dielectric constant of\r\n  sulphur the number 3.2, which agrees practically with the results\r\n  obtained by more delicate methods. For the highest attainable\r\n  precision one should by rights immerse the two plates of the\r\n  condenser first wholly in air and then wholly in sulphur, if the\r\n  ratio of the capacities is to correspond to the dielectric constant.\r\n  In point of fact, however, the error which arises from inserting\r\n  simply a plate of sulphur that exactly fills the space between the\r\n  two plates, is of no consequence.]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 31: As this definition in its simple form is apt to give\r\n  rise to misunderstandings, elucidations are usually added to it. It\r\n  is clear that we cannot lift a quantity of electricity to _K_,\r\n  without changing the distribution on _K_ and the potential on _K_.\r\n  Hence, the charges on _K_ must be conceived as fixed, and so small a\r\n  quantity raised that no appreciable change is produced by it. Taking\r\n  the work thus expended as many times as the small quantity in\r\n  question is contained in the unit of quantity, we shall obtain the\r\n  potential. The potential of a body _K_ may be briefly and precisely\r\n  defined as follows: If we expend the element of work _dW_ to raise\r\n  the element of positive quantity _dQ_ from the earth to the\r\n  conductor, the potential of a conductor _K_ will be given by _V =\r\n  dW/dQ_.]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 32: In this article the solidus or slant stroke is used\r\n  for the usual fractional sign of division.

The thermal capacity\r\n  of a body depends solely upon that body itself. The electrical\r\n  capacity of a body _K_ is influenced by all bodies in its vicinity,\r\n  inasmuch as the charge of these bodies is able to alter the\r\n  potential of _K_. To give, therefore, an unequivocal significance to\r\n  the notion of the capacity (_C_) of a body _K_, _C_ is defined as\r\n  the relation _Q_/_V_ for the body _K_ in a certain given position of\r\n  all neighboring bodies, and during connexion of all neighboring\r\n  conductors with the earth. In practice the situation is much\r\n  simpler. The capacity, for example, of a jar, the inner coating of\r\n  which is almost enveloped by its outer coating, communicating with\r\n  the ground, is not sensibly affected by charged or uncharged\r\n  adjacent conductors.]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 34: These formulæ easily follow from Newton's theorem that\r\n  a homogeneous spherical shell, whose elements obey the law of the\r\n  inverse squares, exerts no force whatever on points within it but\r\n  acts on points without as if the whole mass were concentrated at its\r\n  centre.

Letting _p_ denote the uniform electrical\r\n  pressure on unit of surface of the sphere, the work done is also\r\n  4_r_²[pi]_pdr_. Hence _p = (1/8r²[pi])(q²/r²)_. Subjected to the\r\n  same superficial pressure on all sides, say in a fluid, our half\r\n  sphere would be an equilibrium. Hence we must make the pressure _p_\r\n  act on the surface of the great circle to obtain the effect on the\r\n  balance, which is _r²[pi]p = 1/8(q²/r²) = 1/8V²_.]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 36: The arrangement described is for several reasons not\r\n  fitted for the actual measurement of potential.

The relation which obtains\r\n  between the expended and the available work may be gathered from the\r\n  following simple exposition. A Holtz machine _H_ (Fig. 40) is\r\n  charging a unit jar _L_, which after _n_ discharges of quantity _q_\r\n  and potential _v_, charges the jar _F_ with the quantity _Q_ at the\r\n  potential _V_. The energy of the unit-jar discharges is lost and\r\n  that of the jar _F_ alone is left. Hence the ratio of the available\r\n  work to the total work expended is\r\n\r\n_½QV/[½QV + (n/2)qv]_ and as _Q = nq_, also _V/(V + v)_.\r\n\r\n  If, now, we interpose no unit jar, still the parts of the machine\r\n  and the wires of conduction are themselves virtually such unit jars\r\n  and the formula still subsists _V/(V + [sum]v)_, in which [sum]_v_\r\n  represents the sum of all the successively introduced differences of\r\n  potential in the circuit of connexion.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE PRINCIPLE OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY.[39]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a popular lecture, distinguished for its charming simplicity and\r\nclearness, which Joule delivered in the year 1847,[40] that famous\r\nphysicist declares that the living force which a heavy body has acquired\r\nby its descent through a certain height and which it carries with it in\r\nthe form of the velocity with which it is impressed, is the _equivalent_\r\nof the attraction of gravity through the space fallen through, and that\r\nit would be \"absurd\" to assume that this living force could be destroyed\r\nwithout some restitution of that equivalent. He then adds: \"You will\r\ntherefore be surprised to hear that until very _recently_ the universal\r\nopinion has been that living force could be absolutely and irrevocably\r\ndestroyed at any one's option.\" Let us add that to-day, after\r\nforty-seven years, the _law of the conservation of energy_, wherever\r\ncivilisation exists, is accepted as a fully established truth and\r\nreceives the widest applications in all domains of natural science.\r\n\r\nThe fate of all momentous discoveries is similar. On their first\r\nappearance they are regarded by the majority of men as errors. J. R.\r\nMayer's work on the principle of energy (1842) was rejected by the first\r\nphysical journal of Germany; Helmholtz's treatise (1847) met with no\r\nbetter success; and even Joule, to judge from an intimation of Playfair,\r\nseems to have encountered difficulties with his first publication\r\n(1843). Gradually, however, people are led to see that the new view was\r\nlong prepared for and ready for enunciation, only that a few favored\r\nminds had perceived it much earlier than the rest, and in this way the\r\nopposition of the majority is overcome. With proofs of the fruitfulness\r\nof the new view, with its success, confidence in it increases. The\r\nmajority of the men who employ it cannot enter into a deep-going\r\nanalysis of it; for them, its success is its proof. It can thus happen\r\nthat a view which has led to the greatest discoveries, like Black's\r\ntheory of caloric, in a subsequent period in a province where it does\r\nnot apply may actually become an obstacle to progress by its blinding\r\nour eyes to facts which do not fit in with our favorite conceptions. If\r\na theory is to be protected from this dubious rôle, the grounds and\r\nmotives of its evolution and existence must be examined from time to\r\ntime with the utmost care.\r\n\r\nThe most multifarious physical changes, thermal, electrical, chemical,\r\nand so forth, can be brought about by mechanical work. When such\r\nalterations are reversed they yield anew the mechanical work in exactly\r\nthe quantity which was required for the production of the part reversed.\r\nThis is the _principle of the conservation of energy_; \"energy\" being\r\nthe term which has gradually come into use for that \"indestructible\r\nsomething\" of which the measure is mechanical _work_.\r\n\r\nHow did we acquire this idea? What are the sources from which we have\r\ndrawn it? This question is not only of interest in itself, but also for\r\nthe important reason above touched upon. The opinions which are held\r\nconcerning the foundations of the law of energy still diverge very\r\nwidely from one another. Many trace the principle to the impossibility\r\nof a perpetual motion, which they regard either as sufficiently proved\r\nby experience, or as self-evident. In the province of pure mechanics the\r\nimpossibility of a perpetual motion, or the continuous production of\r\n_work_ without some _permanent_ alteration, is easily demonstrated.\r\nAccordingly, if we start from the theory that all physical processes are\r\npurely _mechanical_ processes, motions of molecules and atoms, we\r\nembrace also, by this _mechanical_ conception of physics, the\r\nimpossibility of a perpetual motion in the _whole_ physical domain. At\r\npresent this view probably counts the most adherents. Other inquirers,\r\nhowever, are for accepting only a purely _experimental_ establishment of\r\nthe law of energy.\r\n\r\nIt will appear, from the discussion to follow, that _all_ the factors\r\nmentioned have co-operated in the development of the view in question;\r\nbut that in addition to them a logical and purely formal factor,\r\nhitherto little considered, has also played a very important part.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE PRINCIPLE OF THE EXCLUDED PERPETUAL MOTION.\r\n\r\nThe law of energy in its modern form is not identical with the principle\r\nof the excluded perpetual motion, but it is very closely related to it.\r\nThe latter principle, however, is by no means new, for in the province\r\nof mechanics it has controlled for centuries the thoughts and\r\ninvestigations of the greatest thinkers. Let us convince ourselves of\r\nthis by the study of a few historical examples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41.]\r\n\r\nS. Stevinus, in his famous work _Hypomnemata mathematica_, Tom. IV, _De\r\nstatica_, (Leyden, 1605, p. 34), treats of the equilibrium of bodies on\r\ninclined planes.\r\n\r\nOver a triangular prism _ABC_, one side of which, _AC_, is horizontal,\r\nan endless cord or chain is slung, to which at equal distances apart\r\nfourteen balls of equal weight are attached, as represented in\r\ncross-section in Figure 41. Since we can imagine the lower symmetrical\r\npart of the cord _ABC_ taken away, Stevinus concludes that the four\r\nballs on _AB_ hold in equilibrium the two balls on _BC_. For if the\r\nequilibrium were for a moment disturbed, it could never subsist: the\r\ncord would keep moving round forever in the same direction,--we should\r\nhave a perpetual motion. He says:\r\n\r\n     \"But if this took place, our row or ring of balls would come once\r\n     more into their original position, and from the same cause the\r\n     eight globes to the left would again be heavier than the six to the\r\n     right, and therefore those eight would sink a second time and these\r\n     six rise, and all the globes would keep up, of themselves, _a\r\n     continuous and unending motion, which is false_.\"[41]\r\n\r\nStevinus, now, easily derives from this principle the laws of\r\nequilibrium on the inclined plane and numerous other fruitful\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter \"Hydrostatics\" of the same work, page 114, Stevinus sets\r\nup the following principle: \"Aquam datam, datum sibi intra aquam locum\r\nservare,\"--a given mass of water preserves within water its given place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42.]\r\n\r\nThis principle is demonstrated as follows (see Fig. 42):\r\n\r\n     \"For, assuming it to be possible by natural means, let us suppose\r\n     that A does not preserve the place assigned to it, but sinks down\r\n     to D. This being posited, the water which succeeds A will, for the\r\n     same reason, also flow down to _D_; _A_ will be forced out of its\r\n     place in _D_; and thus this body of water, for the conditions in it\r\n     are everywhere the same, _will set up a perpetual motion, which is\r\n     absurd_.\"[42]\r\n\r\nFrom this all the principles of hydrostatics are deduced. On this\r\noccasion Stevinus also first develops the thought so fruitful for modern\r\nanalytical mechanics that the equilibrium of a system is not destroyed\r\nby the addition of rigid connexions. As we know, the principle of the\r\nconservation of the centre of gravity is now sometimes deduced from\r\nD'Alembert's principle with the help of that remark. If we were to\r\nreproduce Stevinus's demonstration to-day, we should have to change it\r\nslightly. We find no difficulty in imagining the cord on the prism\r\npossessed of unending uniform motion if all hindrances are thought away,\r\nbut we should protest against the assumption of an accelerated motion or\r\neven against that of a uniform motion, if the resistances were not\r\nremoved. Moreover, for greater precision of proof, the string of balls\r\nmight be replaced by a heavy homogeneous cord of infinite flexibility.\r\nBut all this does not affect in the least the historical value of\r\nStevinus's thoughts. It is a fact, Stevinus deduces apparently much\r\nsimpler truths from the principle of an impossible perpetual motion.\r\n\r\nIn the process of thought which conducted Galileo to his discoveries at\r\nthe end of the sixteenth century, the following principle plays an\r\nimportant part, that a body in virtue of the velocity acquired in its\r\ndescent can rise exactly as high as it fell. This principle, which\r\nappears frequently and with much clearness in Galileo's thought, is\r\nsimply another form of the principle of excluded perpetual motion, as we\r\nshall see it is also in Huygens.\r\n\r\nGalileo, as we know, arrived at the law of uniformly accelerated motion\r\nby _a priori_ considerations, as that law which was the \"simplest and\r\nmost natural,\" after having first assumed a different law which he was\r\ncompelled to reject. To verify his law he executed experiments with\r\nfalling bodies on inclined planes, measuring the times of descent by the\r\nweights of the water which flowed out of a small orifice in a large\r\nvessel. In this experiment he assumes as a fundamental principle, that\r\nthe velocity acquired in descent down an inclined plane always\r\ncorresponds to the vertical height descended through, a conclusion which\r\nfor him is the immediate outcome of the fact that a body which has\r\nfallen down one inclined plane can, with the velocity it has acquired,\r\nrise on another plane of any inclination only to the same vertical\r\nheight. This principle of the height of ascent also led him, as it\r\nseems, to the law of inertia. Let us hear his own masterful words in the\r\n_Dialogo terzo_ (_Opere_, Padova, 1744, Tom. III). On page 96 we read:\r\n\r\n     \"I take it for granted that the velocities acquired by a body in\r\n     descent down planes of different inclinations are equal if the\r\n     heights of those planes are equal.\"[43]\r\n\r\nThen he makes Salviati say in the dialogue:[44]\r\n\r\n     \"What you say seems very probable, but I wish to go further and by\r\n     an experiment so to increase the probability of it that it shall\r\n     amount almost to absolute demonstration. Suppose this sheet of\r\n     paper to be a vertical wall, and from a nail driven in it a ball of\r\n     lead weighing two or three ounces to hang by a very fine thread\r\n     _AB_ four or five feet long. (Fig. 43.) On the wall mark a\r\n     horizontal line _DC_ perpendicular to the vertical _AB_, which\r\n     latter ought to hang about two inches from the wall. If now the\r\n     thread _AB_ with the ball attached take the position _AC_ and the\r\n     ball be let go, you will see the ball first descend through the arc\r\n     _CB_ and passing beyond _B_ rise through the arc _BD_ almost to the\r\n     level of the line _CD_, being prevented from reaching it exactly by\r\n     the resistance of the air and of the thread. From this we may truly\r\n     conclude that its impetus at the point _B_, acquired by its descent\r\n     through the arc _CB_, is sufficient to urge it through a similar\r\n     arc _BD_ to the same height. Having performed this experiment and\r\n     repeated it several times, let us drive in the wall, in the\r\n     projection of the vertical _AB_, as at _E_ or at _F_, a nail five\r\n     or six inches long, so that the thread _AC_, carrying as before the\r\n     ball through the arc _CB_, at the moment it reaches the position\r\n     _AB_, shall strike the nail _E_, and the ball be thus compelled to\r\n     move up the arc _BG_ described about _E_ as centre. Then we shall\r\n     see what the same impetus will here accomplish, acquired now as\r\n     before at the same point _B_, which then drove the same moving body\r\n     through the arc _BD_ to the height of the horizontal _CD_. Now\r\n     gentlemen, you will be pleased to see the ball rise to the\r\n     horizontal line at the point _G_, and the same thing also happen if\r\n     the nail be placed lower as at _F_, in which case the ball would\r\n     describe the arc _BJ_, always terminating its ascent precisely at\r\n     the line _CD_. If the nail be placed so low that the length of\r\n     thread below it does not reach to the height of _CD_ (which would\r\n     happen if _F_ were nearer _B_ than to the intersection of _AB_ with\r\n     the horizontal _CD_), then the thread will wind itself about the\r\n     nail. This experiment leaves no room for doubt as to the truth of\r\n     the supposition. For as the two arcs _CB_, _DB_ are equal and\r\n     similarly situated, the momentum acquired in the descent of the arc\r\n     _CB_ is the same as that acquired in the descent of the arc _DB_;\r\n     but the momentum acquired at _B_ by the descent through the arc\r\n     _CB_ is capable of driving up the same moving body through the arc\r\n     _BD_; hence also the momentum acquired in the descent _DB_ is equal\r\n     to that which drives the same moving body through the same arc from\r\n     _B_ to _D_, so that in general every momentum acquired in the\r\n     descent of an arc is equal to that which causes the same moving\r\n     body to ascend through the same arc; but all the momenta which\r\n     cause the ascent of all the arcs _BD_, _BG_, _BJ_, are equal since\r\n     they are made by the same momentum acquired in the descent _CB_, as\r\n     the experiment shows: therefore all the momenta acquired in the\r\n     descent of the arcs _DB_, _GB_, _JB_ are equal.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43.]\r\n\r\nThe remark relative to the pendulum may be applied to the inclined plane\r\nand leads to the law of inertia. We read on page 124:[45]\r\n\r\n     \"It is plain now that a movable body, starting from rest at _A_ and\r\n     descending down the inclined plane _AB_, acquires a velocity\r\n     proportional to the increment of its time: the velocity possessed\r\n     at _B_ is the greatest of the velocities acquired, and by its\r\n     nature immutably impressed, provided all causes of new acceleration\r\n     or retardation are taken away: I say acceleration, having in view\r\n     its possible further progress along the plane extended;\r\n     retardation, in view of the possibility of its being reversed and\r\n     made to mount the ascending plane _BC_. But in the horizontal plane\r\n     _GH_ its equable motion, according to its velocity as acquired in\r\n     the descent from _A_ to _B_, will be continued _ad infinitum_.\"\r\n     (Fig. 44.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44.]\r\n\r\nHuygens, upon whose shoulders the mantel of Galileo fell, forms a\r\nsharper conception of the law of inertia and generalises the principle\r\nrespecting the heights of ascent which was so fruitful in Galileo's\r\nhands. He employs the latter principle in the solution of the problem of\r\nthe centre of oscillation and is perfectly clear in the statement that\r\nthe principle respecting the heights of ascent is identical with the\r\nprinciple of the excluded perpetual motion.\r\n\r\nThe following important passages then occur (Hugenii, _Horologium\r\noscillatorium, pars secunda_). _Hypotheses_:\r\n\r\n     \"If gravity did not exist, nor the atmosphere obstruct the motions\r\n     of bodies, a body would keep up forever the motion once impressed\r\n     upon it, with equable velocity, in a straight line.\"[46]\r\n\r\nIn part four of the _Horologium de centro oscillationis_ we read:\r\n\r\n     \"If any number of weights be set in motion by the force of gravity,\r\n     the common centre of gravity of the weights as a whole cannot\r\n     possibly rise higher than the place which it occupied when the\r\n     motion began.\r\n\r\n     \"That this hypothesis of ours may arouse no scruples, we will state\r\n     that it simply imports, what no one has ever denied, that heavy\r\n     bodies do not move _upwards_.--And truly if the devisers of the new\r\n     machines who make such futile attempts to construct a perpetual\r\n     motion would acquaint themselves with this principle, they could\r\n     easily be brought to see their errors and to understand that the\r\n     thing is utterly impossible by mechanical means.\"[47]\r\n\r\nThere is possibly a Jesuitical mental reservation contained in the words\r\n\"mechanical means.\" One might be led to believe from them that Huygens\r\nheld a non-mechanical perpetual motion for possible.\r\n\r\nThe generalisation of Galileo's principle is still more clearly put in\r\nProp. IV of the same chapter:\r\n\r\n     \"If a pendulum, composed of several weights, set in motion from\r\n     rest, complete any part of its full oscillation, and from that\r\n     point onwards, the individual weights, with their common connexions\r\n     dissolved, change their acquired velocities upwards and ascend as\r\n     far as they can, the common centre of gravity of all will be\r\n     carried up to the same altitude with that which it occupied before\r\n     the beginning of the oscillation.\"[48]\r\n\r\nOn this last principle now, which is a generalisation, applied to a\r\nsystem of masses, of one of Galileo's ideas respecting a single mass and\r\nwhich from Huygens's explanation we recognise as the principle of\r\nexcluded perpetual motion, Huygens grounds his theory of the centre of\r\noscillation. Lagrange characterises this principle as precarious and is\r\nrejoiced at James Bernoulli's successful attempt, in 1681, to reduce the\r\ntheory of the centre of oscillation to the laws of the lever, which\r\nappeared to him clearer. All the great inquirers of the seventeenth and\r\neighteenth centuries broke a lance on this problem, and it led\r\nultimately, in conjunction with the principle of virtual velocities, to\r\nthe principle enunciated by D'Alembert in 1743 in his _Traité de\r\ndynamique_, though previously employed in a somewhat different form by\r\nEuler and Hermann.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Huygenian principle respecting the heights of ascent\r\nbecame the foundation of the \"law of the conservation of living force,\"\r\nas that was enunciated by John and Daniel Bernoulli and employed with\r\nsuch signal success by the latter in his _Hydrodynamics_. The theorems\r\nof the Bernoullis differ in form only from Lagrange's expression in the\r\n_Analytical Mechanics_.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which Torricelli reached his famous law of efflux for\r\nliquids leads again to our principle. Torricelli assumed that the liquid\r\nwhich flows out of the basal orifice of a vessel cannot by its velocity\r\nof efflux ascend to a greater height than its level in the vessel.\r\n\r\nLet us next consider a point which belongs to pure mechanics, the\r\nhistory of the principle of _virtual motions_ or _virtual velocities_.\r\nThis principle was not first enunciated, as is usually stated, and as\r\nLagrange also asserts, by Galileo, but earlier, by Stevinus. In his\r\n_Trochleostatica_ of the above-cited work, page 72, he says:\r\n\r\n     \"Observe that this axiom of statics holds good here:\r\n\r\n     \"As the space of the body acting is to the space of the body acted\r\n     upon, so is the power of the body acted upon to the power of the\r\n     body acting.\"[49]\r\n\r\nGalileo, as we know, recognised the truth of the principle in the\r\nconsideration of the simple machines, and also deduced the laws of the\r\nequilibrium of liquids from it.\r\n\r\nTorricelli carries the principle back to the properties of the centre of\r\ngravity. The condition controlling equilibrium in a simple machine, in\r\nwhich power and load are represented by weights, is that the common\r\ncentre of gravity of the weights shall not sink. Conversely, if the\r\ncentre of gravity cannot sink equilibrium obtains, because heavy bodies\r\nof themselves do not move upwards. In this form the principle of virtual\r\nvelocities is identical with Huygens's principle of the impossibility of\r\na perpetual motion.\r\n\r\nJohn Bernoulli, in 1717, first perceived the universal import of the\r\nprinciple of virtual movements for all systems; a discovery stated in a\r\nletter to Varignon. Finally, Lagrange gives a general demonstration of\r\nthe principle and founds upon it his whole _Analytical Mechanics_. But\r\nthis general demonstration is based after all upon Huygens and\r\nTorricelli's remarks. Lagrange, as is known, conceives simple pulleys\r\narranged in the directions of the forces of the system, passes a cord\r\nthrough these pulleys, and appends to its free extremity a weight which\r\nis a common measure of all the forces of the system. With no difficulty,\r\nnow, the number of elements of each pulley may be so chosen that the\r\nforces in question shall be replaced by them. It is then clear that if\r\nthe weight at the extremity cannot sink, equilibrium subsists, because\r\nheavy bodies cannot of themselves move upwards. If we do not go so far,\r\nbut wish to abide by Torricelli's idea, we may conceive every individual\r\nforce of the system replaced by a special weight suspended from a cord\r\npassing over a pulley in the direction of the force and attached at its\r\npoint of application. Equilibrium subsists then when the common centre\r\nof gravity of all the weights together cannot sink. The fundamental\r\nsupposition of this demonstration is plainly the impossibility of a\r\nperpetual motion.\r\n\r\nLagrange tried in every way to supply a proof free from extraneous\r\nelements and fully satisfactory, but without complete success. Nor were\r\nhis successors more fortunate.\r\n\r\nThe whole of mechanics, thus, is based upon an idea, which, though\r\nunequivocal, is yet unwonted and not coequal with the other principles\r\nand axioms of mechanics. Every student of mechanics, at some stage of\r\nhis progress, feels the uncomfortableness of this state of affairs;\r\nevery one wishes it removed; but seldom is the difficulty stated in\r\nwords. Accordingly, the zealous pupil of the science is highly rejoiced\r\nwhen he reads in a master like Poinsot (_Théorie générale de l'équilibre\r\net du mouvement des systèmes_) the following passage, in which that\r\nauthor is giving his opinion of the _Analytical Mechanics_:\r\n\r\n     \"In the meantime, because our attention in that work was first\r\n     wholly engrossed with the consideration of its beautiful\r\n     development of mechanics, which seemed to spring complete from a\r\n     single formula, we naturally believed that the science was\r\n     completed or that it only remained to seek the demonstration of the\r\n     principle of virtual velocities. But that quest brought back all\r\n     the difficulties that we had overcome by the principle itself. That\r\n     law so general, wherein are mingled the vague and unfamiliar ideas\r\n     of infinitely small movements and of perturbations of equilibrium,\r\n     only grew obscure upon examination; and the work of Lagrange\r\n     supplying nothing clearer than the march of analysis, we saw\r\n     plainly that the clouds had only appeared lifted from the course of\r\n     mechanics because they had, so to speak, been gathered at the very\r\n     origin of that science.\r\n\r\n     \"At bottom, a general demonstration of the principle of virtual\r\n     velocities would be equivalent to the establishment of the whole of\r\n     mechanics upon a different basis: for the demonstration of a law\r\n     which embraces a whole science is neither more nor less than the\r\n     reduction of that science to another law just as general, but\r\n     evident, or at least more simple than the first, and which,\r\n     consequently, would render that useless.\"[50]\r\n\r\nAccording to Poinsot, therefore, a proof of the principle of virtual\r\nmovements is tantamount to a total rehabilitation of mechanics.\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance of discomfort to the mathematician is, that in the\r\nhistorical form in which mechanics at present exists, dynamics is\r\nfounded on statics, whereas it is desirable that in a science which\r\npretends to deductive completeness the more special statical theorems\r\nshould be deducible from the more general dynamical principles.\r\n\r\nIn fact, a great master, Gauss, gave expression to this desire in his\r\npresentment of the principle of least constraint (Crelle's _Journal für\r\nreine und angewandte Mathematik_, Vol. IV, p. 233) in the following\r\nwords: \"Proper as it is that in the gradual development of a science,\r\nand in the instruction of individuals, the easy should precede the\r\ndifficult, the simple the complex, the special the general, yet the\r\nmind, when once it has reached a higher point of view, demands the\r\ncontrary course, in which all statics shall appear simply as a special\r\ncase of mechanics.\" Gauss's own principle, now, possesses all the\r\nrequisites of universality, but its difficulty is that it is not\r\nimmediately intelligible and that Gauss deduced it with the help of\r\nD'Alembert's principle, a procedure which left matters where they were\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nWhence, now, is derived this strange part which the principle of virtual\r\nmotion plays in mechanics? For the present I shall only make this reply.\r\nIt would be difficult for me to tell the difference of impression which\r\nLagrange's proof of the principle made on me when I first took it up as\r\na student and when I subsequently resumed it after having made\r\nhistorical researches. It first appeared to me insipid, chiefly on\r\naccount of the pulleys and the cords which did not fit in with the\r\nmathematical view, and whose action I would much rather have discovered\r\nfrom the principle itself than have taken for granted. But now that I\r\nhave studied the history of the science I cannot imagine a more\r\nbeautiful demonstration.\r\n\r\nIn fact, through all mechanics it is this self-same principle of\r\nexcluded perpetual motion which accomplishes almost all, which\r\ndispleased Lagrange, but which he still had to employ, at least tacitly,\r\nin his own demonstration. If we give this principle its proper place and\r\nsetting, the paradox is explained.\r\n\r\nThe principle of excluded perpetual motion is thus no new discovery; it\r\nhas been the guiding idea, for three hundred years, of all the great\r\ninquirers. But the principle cannot properly be _based_ upon mechanical\r\nperceptions. For long before the development of mechanics the conviction\r\nof its truth existed and even contributed to that development. Its power\r\nof conviction, therefore, must have more universal and deeper roots. We\r\nshall revert to this point.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. MECHANICAL PHYSICS.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that an unmistakable tendency has prevailed, from\r\nDemocritus to the present day, to explain _all_ physical events\r\n_mechanically_. Not to mention earlier obscure expressions of that\r\ntendency we read in Huygens the following:[51]\r\n\r\n     \"There can be no doubt that light consists of the _motion_ of a\r\n     certain substance. For if we examine its production, we find that\r\n     here on earth it is principally fire and flame which engender it,\r\n     both of which contain beyond doubt bodies which are in rapid\r\n     movement, since they dissolve and destroy many other bodies more\r\n     solid than they: while if we regard its effects, we see that when\r\n     light is accumulated, say by concave mirrors, it has the property\r\n     of combustion just as fire has, that is to say, it disunites the\r\n     parts of bodies, which is assuredly a proof of _motion_, at least\r\n     in the _true philosophy_, in which the causes of all natural\r\n     effects are conceived as _mechanical_ causes. Which in my judgment\r\n     must be accomplished or all hope of ever understanding physics\r\n     renounced.\"[52]\r\n\r\nS. Carnot,[53] in introducing the principle of excluded perpetual motion\r\ninto the theory of heat, makes the following apology:\r\n\r\n     \"It will be objected here, perhaps, that a perpetual motion proved\r\n     impossible for _purely mechanical actions_, is perhaps not so when\r\n     the influence of _heat_ or of electricity is employed. But can\r\n     phenomena of heat or electricity be thought of as due to anything\r\n     else than to _certain motions of bodies_, and as such must they not\r\n     be subject to the general laws of mechanics?\"[54]\r\n\r\nThese examples, which might be multiplied by quotations from recent\r\nliterature indefinitely, show that a tendency to explain all things\r\nmechanically actually exists. This tendency is also intelligible.\r\nMechanical events as simple motions in space and time best admit of\r\nobservation and pursuit by the help of our highly organised senses. We\r\nreproduce mechanical processes almost without effort in our imagination.\r\nPressure as a circumstance that produces motion is very familiar to us\r\nfrom daily experience. All changes which the individual personally\r\nproduces in his environment, or humanity brings about by means of the\r\narts in the world, are effected through the instrumentality of\r\n_motions_. Almost of necessity, therefore, motion appears to us as the\r\nmost important physical factor. Moreover, mechanical properties may be\r\ndiscovered in all physical events. The sounding bell trembles, the\r\nheated body expands, the electrified body attracts other bodies. Why,\r\ntherefore, should we not attempt to grasp all events under their\r\nmechanical aspect, since that is so easily apprehended and most\r\naccessible to observation and measurement? In fact, no objection _is_ to\r\nbe made to the attempt to elucidate the properties of physical events by\r\nmechanical _analogies_.\r\n\r\nBut modern physics has proceeded _very far_ in this direction. The point\r\nof view which Wundt represents in his excellent treatise _On the\r\nPhysical Axioms_ is probably shared by the majority of physicists. The\r\naxioms of physics which Wundt sets up are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. All natural causes are motional causes.\r\n\r\n2. Every motional cause lies outside the object moved.\r\n\r\n3. All motional causes act in the direction of the straight line of\r\njunction, and so forth.\r\n\r\n4. The effect of every cause persists.\r\n\r\n5. Every effect involves an equal countereffect.\r\n\r\n6. Every effect is equivalent to its cause.\r\n\r\nThese principles might be studied properly enough as fundamental\r\nprinciples of mechanics. But when they are set up as axioms of physics,\r\ntheir enunciation is simply tantamount to a negation of all events\r\nexcept motion.\r\n\r\nAccording to Wundt, all changes of nature are mere changes of place. All\r\ncauses are motional causes (page 26). Any discussion of the\r\nphilosophical grounds on which Wundt supports his theory would lead us\r\ndeep into the speculations of the Eleatics and the Herbartians. Change\r\nof place, Wundt holds, is the _only_ change of a thing in which a thing\r\nremains identical with itself. If a thing changed _qualitatively_, we\r\nshould be obliged to imagine that something was annihilated and\r\nsomething else created in its place, which is not to be reconciled with\r\nour idea of the identity of the object observed and of the\r\nindestructibility of matter. But we have only to remember that the\r\nEleatics encountered difficulties of exactly the same sort in motion.\r\nCan we not also imagine that a thing is destroyed in _one_ place and in\r\n_another_ an exactly similar thing created? After all, do we really know\r\n_more_ why a body leaves one place and appears in another, than why a\r\n_cold_ body grows _warm_? Granted that we had a perfect knowledge of the\r\nmechanical processes of nature, could we and should we, for that reason,\r\n_put out of the world_ all other processes that we do not understand? On\r\nthis principle it would really be the simplest course to deny the\r\nexistence of the whole world. This is the point at which the Eleatics\r\nultimately arrived, and the school of Herbart stopped little short of\r\nthe same goal.\r\n\r\nPhysics treated in this sense supplies us simply with a diagram of the\r\nworld, in which we do not know reality again. It happens, in fact, to\r\nmen who give themselves up to this view for many years, that the world\r\nof sense from which they start as a province of the greatest\r\nfamiliarity, suddenly becomes, in their eyes, the supreme\r\n\"world-riddle.\"\r\n\r\nIntelligible as it is, therefore, that the efforts of thinkers have\r\nalways been bent upon the \"reduction of all physical processes to the\r\nmotions of atoms,\" it must yet be affirmed that this is a chimerical\r\nideal. This ideal has often played an effective part in popular\r\nlectures, but in the workshop of the serious inquirer it has discharged\r\nscarcely the least function. What has really been achieved in mechanical\r\nphysics is either the _elucidation_ of physical processes by more\r\nfamiliar _mechanical analogies_, (for example, the theories of light and\r\nof electricity,) or the exact _quantitative_ ascertainment of the\r\nconnexion of mechanical processes with other physical processes, for\r\nexample, the results of thermodynamics.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE PRINCIPLE OF ENERGY IN PHYSICS.\r\n\r\nWe can know only from _experience_ that mechanical processes produce\r\nother physical transformations, or _vice versa_. The attention was first\r\ndirected to the connexion of mechanical processes, especially the\r\nperformance of work, with changes of thermal conditions by the invention\r\nof the steam-engine, and by its great technical importance. Technical\r\ninterests and the need of scientific lucidity meeting in the mind of S.\r\nCarnot led to the remarkable development from which thermodynamics\r\nflowed. It is simply _an accident of history_ that the development in\r\nquestion was not connected with the practical applications of\r\n_electricity_.\r\n\r\nIn the determination of the maximum quantity of _work_ that, generally,\r\na heat-machine, or, to take a special case, a steam-engine, can perform\r\nwith the expenditure of a _given_ amount of heat of combustion, Carnot\r\nis guided by mechanical analogies. A body can do work on being heated,\r\nby expanding under pressure. But to do this the body must receive heat\r\nfrom a _hotter_ body. Heat, therefore, to do work, must pass from a\r\nhotter body to a colder body, just as water must fall from a higher\r\nlevel to a lower level to put a mill-wheel in motion. Differences of\r\ntemperature, accordingly, represent forces able to do work exactly as do\r\ndifferences of height in heavy bodies. Carnot pictures to himself an\r\nideal process in which no heat flows away unused, that is, without doing\r\nwork. With a given expenditure of heat, accordingly, this process\r\nfurnishes the maximum of work. An analogue of the process would be a\r\nmill-wheel which scooping its water out of a higher level would slowly\r\ncarry it to a lower level without the loss of a drop. A peculiar\r\nproperty of the process is, that with the expenditure of the same work\r\nthe water can be raised again exactly to its original level. This\r\nproperty of _reversibility_ is also shared by the process of Carnot. His\r\nprocess also can be reversed by the expenditure of the same amount of\r\nwork, and the heat again brought back to its original temperature level.\r\n\r\nSuppose, now, we had _two_ different reversible processes _A_, _B_, such\r\nthat in _A_ a quantity of heat, _Q_, flowing off from the temperature\r\n_t₁_ to the lower temperature _t₂_ should perform the work _W_, but in\r\n_B_ under the same circumstances it should perform a greater quantity of\r\nwork _W_ + _W'_; then, we could join _B_ in the sense assigned and _A_\r\nin the reverse sense into a _single_ process. Here _A_ would reverse the\r\ntransformation of heat produced by _B_ and would leave a surplus of work\r\n_W'_, produced, so to speak, from nothing. The combination would present\r\na perpetual motion.\r\n\r\nWith the feeling, now, that it makes little difference whether the\r\nmechanical laws are broken directly or indirectly (by processes of\r\nheat), and convinced of the existence of a _universal_ law-ruled\r\nconnexion of nature, Carnot here excludes for the first time from the\r\nprovince of _general_ physics the possibility of a perpetual motion.\r\n_But it follows, then, that the quantity of work W, produced by the\r\npassage of a quantity of heat Q from a temperature t₁ to a temperature\r\nt₂, is independent of the nature of the substances as also of the\r\ncharacter of the process, so far as that is unaccompanied by loss, but\r\nis wholly dependent upon the temperature t₁, t₂.\r\n\r\nThis important principle has been fully confirmed by the special\r\nresearches of Carnot himself (1824), of Clapeyron (1834), and of Sir\r\nWilliam Thomson (1849), now Lord Kelvin. The principle was reached\r\n_without any assumption whatever_ concerning the nature of heat, simply\r\nby the exclusion of a perpetual motion. Carnot, it is true, was an\r\nadherent of the theory of Black, according to which the sum-total of the\r\nquantity of heat in the world is constant, but so far as his\r\ninvestigations have been hitherto considered the decision on this point\r\nis of no consequence. Carnot's principle led to the most remarkable\r\nresults. W. Thomson (1848) founded upon it the ingenious idea of an\r\n\"absolute\" scale of temperature. James Thomson (1849) conceived a Carnot\r\nprocess to take place with water freezing under pressure and, therefore,\r\nperforming work. He discovered, thus, that the freezing point is lowered\r\n0·0075° Celsius by every additional atmosphere of pressure. This is\r\nmentioned merely as an example.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty years after the publication of Carnot's book a further\r\nadvance was made by J. R. Mayer and J. P. Joule. Mayer, while engaged as\r\na physician in the service of the Dutch, observed, during a process of\r\nbleeding in Java, an unusual redness of the venous blood. In agreement\r\nwith Liebig's theory of animal heat he connected this fact with the\r\ndiminished loss of heat in warmer climates, and with the diminished\r\nexpenditure of organic combustibles. The total expenditure of heat of a\r\nman at rest must be equal to the total heat of combustion. But since\r\n_all_ organic actions, even the mechanical actions, must be set down to\r\nthe credit of the heat of combustion, some connexion must exist between\r\nmechanical work and expenditure of heat.\r\n\r\nJoule started from quite similar convictions concerning the galvanic\r\nbattery. A heat of association equivalent to the consumption of the zinc\r\ncan be made to appear in the galvanic cell. If a current is set up, a\r\npart of this heat appears in the conductor of the current. The\r\ninterposition of an apparatus for the decomposition of water causes a\r\npart of this heat to disappear, which on the burning of the explosive\r\ngas formed, is reproduced. If the current runs an electromotor, a\r\nportion of the heat again disappears, which, on the consumption of the\r\nwork by friction, again makes its appearance. Accordingly, both the\r\nheat produced and the work produced, appeared to Joule also as\r\nconnected with the consumption of material. The thought was therefore\r\npresent, both to Mayer and to Joule, of regarding heat and work as\r\nequivalent quantities, so connected with each other that what is lost in\r\none form universally appears in another. The result of this was a\r\n_substantial_ conception of heat and of work, and _ultimately a\r\nsubstantial conception of energy_. Here every physical change of\r\ncondition is regarded as energy, the destruction of which generates work\r\nor equivalent heat. An electric charge, for example, is energy.\r\n\r\nIn 1842 Mayer had calculated from the physical constants then\r\nuniversally accepted that by the disappearance of one kilogramme-calorie\r\n365 kilogramme-metres of work could be performed, and _vice versa_.\r\nJoule, on the other hand, by a long series of delicate and varied\r\nexperiments beginning in 1843 ultimately determined the mechanical\r\nequivalent of the kilogramme-calorie, more exactly, as 425\r\nkilogramme-metres.\r\n\r\nIf we estimate every change of physical condition by the _mechanical\r\nwork_ which can be performed upon the _disappearance_ of that condition,\r\nand call this measure _energy_, then we can measure all physical changes\r\nof condition, no matter how different they may be, with the same common\r\nmeasure, and say: _the sum-total of all energy remains constant_. This\r\nis the form that the principle of excluded perpetual motion received at\r\nthe hands of Mayer, Joule, Helmholtz, and W. Thomson in its extension to\r\nthe whole domain of physics.\r\n\r\nAfter it had been proved that heat must _disappear_ if mechanical work\r\nwas to be done at its expense, Carnot's principle could no longer be\r\nregarded as a complete expression of the facts. Its improved form was\r\nfirst given, in 1850, by Clausius, whom Thomson followed in 1851. It\r\nruns thus: \"If a quantity of heat _Q'_ is transformed into work in a\r\nreversible process, _another_ quantity of heat _Q_ of the absolute[55]\r\ntemperature _T₁_ is lowered to the absolute temperature _T₂_.\" Here\r\n_Q'_ is dependent only on _Q_, _T₁_, _T₂_, but is independent of the\r\nsubstances used and of the character of the process, so far as that is\r\nunaccompanied by loss. Owing to this last fact, it is sufficient to find\r\nthe relation which obtains for some one well-known physical substance,\r\nsay a gas, and some definite simple process. The relation found will be\r\nthe one that holds generally. We get, thus,\r\n\r\n_Q'/(Q' + Q) = (T₁-T₂)/T₁_ (1)\r\n\r\nthat is, the quotient of the available heat _Q'_ transformed into work\r\ndivided by the sum of the transformed and transferred heats (the total\r\nsum used), the so-called _economical coefficient_ of the process, is,\r\n\r\n_(T₁-T₂)/T₁_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE CONCEPTIONS OF HEAT.\r\n\r\nWhen a cold body is put in contact with a warm body it is observed that\r\nthe first body is warmed and that the second body is cooled. We may say\r\nthat the first body is warmed _at the expense of_ the second body. This\r\nsuggests the notion of a thing, or heat-substance, which passes from the\r\none body to the other. If two masses of water _m_, _m'_, of unequal\r\ntemperatures, be put together, it will be found, upon the rapid\r\nequalisation of the temperatures, that the respective changes of\r\ntemperatures _u_ and _u'_ are inversely proportional to the masses and\r\nof opposite signs, so that the algebraical sum of the products is,\r\n\r\n_mu + m'u' = 0_.\r\n\r\nBlack called the products _mu_, _m'u'_, which are decisive for our\r\nknowledge of the process, _quantities of heat_. We may form a very clear\r\n_picture_ of these products by conceiving them with Black as measures of\r\nthe quantities of some substance. But the essential thing is not this\r\npicture but the _constancy_ of the sum of these products in simple\r\nprocesses of conduction. If a quantity of heat disappears at one point,\r\nan equally large quantity will make its appearance at some other point.\r\nThe retention of this idea leads to the discovery of specific heat.\r\nBlack, finally, perceives that also something else may appear for a\r\nvanished quantity of heat, namely: the fusion or vaporisation of a\r\ndefinite quantity of matter. He adheres here still to this favorite\r\nview, though with some freedom, and considers the vanished quantity of\r\nheat as still present, but as _latent_.\r\n\r\nThe generally accepted notion of a caloric, or heat-stuff, was strongly\r\nshaken by the work of Mayer and Joule. If the quantity of heat can be\r\nincreased and diminished, people said, heat cannot be a substance, but\r\nmust be a _motion_. The subordinate part of this statement has become\r\nmuch more popular than all the rest of the doctrine of energy. But we\r\nmay convince ourselves that the motional conception of heat is now as\r\nunessential as was formerly its conception as a substance. Both ideas\r\nwere favored or impeded solely by accidental historical circumstances.\r\nIt does not follow that heat is not a substance from the fact that a\r\nmechanical equivalent exists for quantity of heat. We will make this\r\nclear by the following question which bright students have sometimes put\r\nto me. Is there a mechanical equivalent of electricity as there is a\r\nmechanical equivalent of heat? Yes, and no. There is no mechanical\r\nequivalent of _quantity_ of electricity as there is an equivalent of\r\n_quantity_ of heat, because the same quantity of electricity has a very\r\ndifferent capacity for work, according to the circumstances in which it\r\nis placed; but there _is_ a mechanical equivalent of electrical energy.\r\n\r\nLet us ask another question. Is there a mechanical equivalent of water?\r\nNo, there is no mechanical equivalent of quantity of water, but there is\r\na mechanical equivalent of weight of water multiplied by its distance\r\nof descent.\r\n\r\nWhen a Leyden jar is discharged and work thereby performed, we do not\r\npicture to ourselves that the quantity of electricity disappears as work\r\nis done, but we simply assume that the electricities come into different\r\npositions, equal quantities of positive and negative electricity being\r\nunited with one another.\r\n\r\nWhat, now, is the reason of this difference of view in our treatment of\r\nheat and of electricity? The reason is purely historical, wholly\r\nconventional, and, what is still more important, is wholly indifferent.\r\nI may be allowed to establish this assertion.\r\n\r\nIn 1785 Coulomb constructed his torsion balance, by which he was enabled\r\nto measure the repulsion of electrified bodies. Suppose we have two\r\nsmall balls, _A_, _B_, which over their whole extent are similarly\r\nelectrified. These two balls will exert on one another, at a certain\r\ndistance _r_ of their centres, a certain repulsion _p_. We bring into\r\ncontact with _B_ now a ball _C_, suffer both to be equally electrified,\r\nand then measure the repulsion of _B_ from _A_ and of _C_ from _A_ at\r\nthe same distance _r_. The sum of these repulsions is again _p_.\r\nAccordingly something has remained constant. If we ascribe this effect\r\nto a substance, then we infer naturally its constancy. But the essential\r\npoint of the exposition is the divisibility of the electric force _p_\r\nand not the simile of substance.\r\n\r\nIn 1838 Riess constructed his electrical air-thermometer (the\r\nthermoelectrometer). This gives a measure of the quantity of heat\r\nproduced by the discharge of jars. This quantity of heat is not\r\nproportional to the quantity of electricity contained in the jar by\r\nCoulomb's measure, but if _Q_ be this quantity and _C_ be the capacity,\r\nis proportional to _Q_²/2_C_, or, more simply still, to the energy of\r\nthe charged jar. If, now, we discharge the jar completely through the\r\nthermometer, we obtain a certain quantity of heat, _W_. But if we make\r\nthe discharge through the thermometer into a second jar, we obtain a\r\nquantity less than _W_. But we may obtain the remainder by completely\r\ndischarging both jars through the air-thermometer, when it will again be\r\nproportional to the energy of the two jars. On the first, incomplete\r\ndischarge, accordingly, a part of the electricity's capacity for work\r\nwas lost.\r\n\r\nWhen the charge of a jar produces heat its energy is changed and its\r\nvalue by Riess's thermometer is decreased. But by Coulomb's measure the\r\nquantity remains unaltered.\r\n\r\nNow let us imagine that Riess's thermometer had been invented before\r\nCoulomb's torsion balance, which is not a difficult feat, since both\r\ninventions are independent of each other; what would be more natural\r\nthan that the \"quantity\" of electricity contained in a jar should be\r\nmeasured by the heat produced in the thermometer? But then, this\r\nso-called quantity of electricity would decrease on the production of\r\nheat or on the performance of work, whereas it now remains unchanged;\r\nin that case, therefore, electricity would not be a _substance_ but a\r\n_motion_, whereas now it is still a substance. The reason, therefore,\r\nwhy we have other notions of electricity than we have of heat, is purely\r\nhistorical, accidental, and conventional.\r\n\r\nThis is also the case with other physical things. Water does not\r\ndisappear when work is done. Why? Because we measure quantity of water\r\nwith scales, just as we do electricity. But suppose the capacity of\r\nwater for work were called quantity, and had to be measured, therefore,\r\nby a mill instead of by scales; then this quantity also would disappear\r\nas it performed the work. It may, now, be easily conceived that many\r\nsubstances are not so easily got at as water. In that case we should be\r\nunable to carry out the one kind of measurement with the scales whilst\r\nmany other modes of measurement would still be left us.\r\n\r\nIn the case of heat, now, the historically established measure of\r\n\"quantity\" is accidentally the work-value of the heat. Accordingly, its\r\nquantity disappears when work is done. But that heat is not a substance\r\nfollows from this as little as does the opposite conclusion that it is a\r\nsubstance. In Black's case the quantity of heat remains constant because\r\nthe heat passes into no _other_ form of energy.\r\n\r\nIf any one to-day should still wish to think of heat as a substance, we\r\nmight allow that person this liberty with little ado. He would only have\r\nto assume that that which we call quantity of heat was the energy of a\r\nsubstance whose quantity remained unaltered, but whose energy changed.\r\nIn point of fact we might much better say, in analogy with the other\r\nterms of physics, energy of heat, instead of quantity of heat.\r\n\r\nWhen we wonder, therefore, at the discovery that heat is motion, we\r\nwonder at something that was never discovered. It is perfectly\r\nindifferent and possesses not the slightest scientific value, whether we\r\nthink of heat as a substance or not. The fact is, heat behaves in some\r\nconnexions like a substance, in others not. Heat is latent in steam as\r\noxygen is latent in water.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE CONFORMITY IN THE DEPORTMENT OF THE ENERGIES.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing reflexions will gain in lucidity from a consideration of\r\nthe conformity which obtains in the behavior of all energies, a point to\r\nwhich I called attention long ago.[56]\r\n\r\nA weight _P_ at a height _H₁_ represents an energy _W₁ = PH₁_. If we\r\nsuffer the weight to sink to a lower height _H₂_, during which work is\r\ndone, and the work done is employed in the production of living force,\r\nheat, or an electric charge, in short, is transformed, then the energy\r\n_W₂ = PH₂_ is still _left_. The equation subsists\r\n\r\n_W₁/H₁ = W₂/H₂_, (2)\r\n\r\nor, denoting the _transformed_ energy by _W' = W₁-W₂_ and the\r\n_transferred_ energy, that transported to the lower level, by _W = W₂_,\r\n\r\n_W'/(W' + W) = (H₁-H₂)/H₁_, (3)\r\n\r\nan equation in all respects analogous to equation (1) at page 165. The\r\nproperty in question, therefore, is by no means peculiar to heat.\r\nEquation (2) gives the relation between the energy taken from the higher\r\nlevel and that deposited on the lower level (the energy left behind); it\r\nsays that these _energies_ are proportional to the _heights of the\r\nlevels_. An equation analogous to equation (2) may be set up for _every_\r\nform of energy; hence the equation which corresponds to equation (3),\r\nand so to equation (1), may be regarded as valid for every form. For\r\nelectricity, for example, _H₁_, _H₂_ signify the potentials.\r\n\r\nWhen we observe for the first time the agreement here indicated in the\r\ntransformative law of the energies, it appears surprising and\r\nunexpected, for we do not perceive at once its reason. But to him who\r\npursues the comparative historical method that reason will not long\r\nremain a secret.\r\n\r\nSince Galileo, mechanical work, though long under a different name, has\r\nbeen a _fundamental concept_ of mechanics, as also a very important\r\nnotion in the applied sciences. The transformation of work into living\r\nforce, and of living force into work, suggests directly the notion of\r\nenergy--the idea having been first fruitfully employed by Huygens,\r\nalthough Thomas Young first called it by the _name_ of \"energy.\" Let us\r\nadd to this the constancy of weight (really the constancy of mass) and\r\nwe shall see that with respect to mechanical energy it is involved in\r\nthe very definition of the term that the capacity for work or the\r\npotential energy of a weight is proportional to the height of the level\r\nat which it is, in the geometrical sense, and that it decreases on the\r\nlowering of the weight, on transformation, proportionally to the height\r\nof the level. The zero level here is wholly arbitrary. With this,\r\nequation (2) is given, from which all the other forms follow.\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect on the tremendous start which mechanics had over the\r\nother branches of physics, it is not to be wondered at that the attempt\r\nwas always made to apply the notions of that science wherever this was\r\npossible. Thus the notion of mass, for example, was imitated by Coulomb\r\nin the notion of quantity of electricity. In the further development of\r\nthe theory of electricity, the notion of work was likewise immediately\r\nintroduced in the theory of potential, and heights of electrical level\r\nwere measured by the work of unit of quantity raised to that level. But\r\nwith this the preceding equation with all its consequences is given for\r\nelectrical energy. The case with the other energies was similar.\r\n\r\n_Thermal_ energy, however, appears as a special case. Only by the\r\npeculiar experiments mentioned could it be discovered that heat is an\r\nenergy. But the measure of this energy by Black's quantity of heat is\r\nthe outcome of fortuitous circumstances. In the first place, the\r\naccidental slight variability of the capacity for heat _c_ with the\r\ntemperature, and the accidental slight deviation of the usual\r\nthermometrical scales from the scale derived from _the tensions of\r\ngases_, brings it about that the notion \"quantity of heat\" can be set up\r\nand that the quantity of heat _ct_ corresponding to a difference of\r\ntemperature _t_ is nearly proportional to the energy of the heat. It is\r\na quite accidental historical circumstance that Amontons hit upon the\r\nidea of measuring temperature by the tension of a gas. It is certain in\r\nthis that he did not think of the work of the heat.[57] But the numbers\r\nstanding for temperature, thus, are made proportional to the tensions of\r\ngases, that is, to the work done by gases, with otherwise equal changes\r\nof volume. It thus happens that _temperature heights_ and _level heights\r\nof work_ are proportional to one another.\r\n\r\nIf properties of the thermal condition varying greatly from the tensions\r\nof gases had been chosen, this relation would have assumed very\r\ncomplicated forms, and the agreement between heat and the other energies\r\nabove considered would not subsist. It is very instructive to reflect\r\nupon this point. A _natural law_, therefore, is not implied in the\r\nconformity of the behavior of the energies, but this conformity is\r\nrather conditioned by the uniformity of our modes of conception and is\r\nalso partly a matter of good fortune.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. THE DIFFERENCES OF THE ENERGIES AND THE LIMITS OF THE PRINCIPLE OF\r\nENERGY.\r\n\r\nOf every quantity of heat _Q_ which does work in a reversible process\r\n(one unaccompanied by loss) between the absolute temperatures _T₁_,\r\n_T₂_, only the portion\r\n\r\n_(T₁-T₂)/T₁_\r\n\r\nis transformed into work, while the remainder is transferred to the\r\nlower temperature-level _T₂_. This transferred portion can, upon the\r\nreversal of the process, with the same expenditure of work, again be\r\nbrought back to the level _T₁_. But if the process is not reversible,\r\nthen more heat than in the foregoing case flows to the lower level, and\r\nthe surplus can no longer be brought back to the higher level _T₂_\r\nwithout some _special_ expenditure. W. Thomson (1852), accordingly, drew\r\nattention to the fact, that in all non-reversible, that is, in all real\r\nthermal processes, quantities of heat are lost for mechanical work, and\r\nthat accordingly a dissipation or waste of mechanical energy is taking\r\nplace. In all cases, heat is only partially transformed into work, but\r\nfrequently work is wholly transformed into heat. Hence, a tendency\r\nexists towards a diminution of the _mechanical_ energy and towards an\r\nincrease of the _thermal_ energy of the world.\r\n\r\nFor a simple, closed cyclical process, accompanied by no loss, in which\r\nthe quantity of heat _Q₁_ is taken from the level _T₁_, and the quantity\r\n_Q₂_ is deposited upon the level _T₂_, the following relation, agreeably\r\nto equation (2), exists,\r\n\r\n_-(Q₁/T₁) + (Q₂/T₂) = 0_.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, for any number of compound reversible cycles Clausius finds\r\nthe algebraical sum\r\n\r\n_[sum]Q/T = 0_,\r\n\r\nand supposing the temperature to change continuously,\r\n\r\n_[integral]dQ/T = 0_ (4)\r\n\r\nHere the elements of the quantities of heat deducted from a given level\r\nare reckoned negative, and the elements imparted to it, positive. If the\r\nprocess is not reversible, then expression (4), which Clausius calls\r\n_entropy_, increases. In actual practice this is always the case, and\r\nClausius finds himself led to the statement:\r\n\r\n1. That the energy of the world remains constant.\r\n\r\n2. That the entropy of the world tends toward a maximum.\r\n\r\nOnce we have noted the above-indicated conformity in the behavior of\r\ndifferent energies, the _peculiarity_ of thermal energy here mentioned\r\nmust strike us. Whence is this peculiarity derived, for, generally every\r\nenergy passes only partly into another form, which is also true of\r\nthermal energy? The explanation will be found in the following.\r\n\r\nEvery transformation of a special kind of energy _A_ is accompanied with\r\na fall of potential of that particular kind of energy, including heat.\r\nBut whilst for the other kinds of energy a transformation and therefore\r\na loss of energy on the part of the kind sinking in potential is\r\nconnected with the fall of the potential, with heat the case is\r\ndifferent. Heat can suffer a fall of potential without sustaining a loss\r\nof energy, at least according to the customary mode of estimation. If a\r\nweight sinks, it must create perforce kinetic energy, or heat, or some\r\nother form of energy. Also, an electrical charge cannot suffer a fall of\r\npotential without loss of energy, i. e., without transformation. But\r\nheat can pass with a fall of temperature to a body of greater capacity\r\nand the same thermal energy still be preserved, so long as we regard\r\n_every quantity_ of heat as energy. This it is that gives to heat,\r\nbesides its property of energy, in many cases the character of a\r\nmaterial _substance_, or quantity.\r\n\r\nIf we look at the matter in an unprejudiced light, we must ask if there\r\nis any scientific sense or purpose in still considering as energy a\r\nquantity of heat that can no longer be transformed into mechanical work,\r\n(for example, the heat of a closed equably warmed material system). The\r\nprinciple of energy certainly plays in this case a wholly superfluous\r\nrôle, which is assigned to it only from habit.[58] To maintain the\r\nprinciple of energy in the face of a knowledge of the dissipation or\r\nwaste of mechanical energy, in the face of the increase of entropy is\r\nequivalent almost to the liberty which Black took when he regarded the\r\nheat of liquefaction as still present but latent.[59] It is to be\r\nremarked further, that the expressions \"energy of the world\" and\r\n\"entropy of the world\" are slightly permeated with scholasticism. Energy\r\nand entropy are _metrical_ notions. What meaning can there be in\r\napplying these notions to a case in which they are not applicable, in\r\nwhich their values are not determinable?\r\n\r\nIf we could really determine the entropy of the world it would represent\r\na true, absolute measure of time. In this way is best seen the utter\r\ntautology of a statement that the entropy of the world increases with\r\nthe time. Time, and the fact that certain changes take place only in a\r\ndefinite sense, are one and the same thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. THE SOURCES OF THE PRINCIPLE OF ENERGY.\r\n\r\nWe are now prepared to answer the question, What are the sources of the\r\nprinciple of energy? All knowledge of nature is derived in the last\r\ninstance from experience. In this sense they are right who look upon the\r\nprinciple of energy as a result of experience.\r\n\r\nExperience teaches that the sense-elements [alpha beta gamma delta ...]\r\ninto which the world may be decomposed, are subject to change. It tells\r\nus further, that certain of these elements are _connected_ with other\r\nelements, so that they appear and disappear together; or, that the\r\nappearance of the elements of one class is connected with the\r\ndisappearance of the elements of the other class. We will avoid here the\r\nnotions of cause and effect because of their obscurity and\r\nequivocalness. The result of experience may be expressed as follows:\r\n_The sensuous elements of the world ([alpha beta gamma delta ...]) show\r\nthemselves to be interdependent._ This interdependence is best\r\nrepresented by some such conception as is in geometry that of the mutual\r\ndependence of the sides and angles of a triangle, only much more varied\r\nand complex.\r\n\r\nAs an example, we may take a mass of gas enclosed in a cylinder and\r\npossessed of a definite volume ([alpha]), which we change by a pressure\r\n([beta]) on the piston, at the same time feeling the cylinder with our\r\nhand and receiving a sensation of heat ([gamma]). Increase of pressure\r\ndiminishes the volume and increases the sensation of heat.\r\n\r\nThe various facts of experience are not in all respects alike. Their\r\ncommon sensuous elements are placed in relief by a process of\r\nabstraction and thus impressed upon the memory. In this way the\r\nexpression is obtained of the features of _agreement_ of extensive\r\ngroups of facts. The simplest sentence which we can utter is, by the\r\nvery nature of language, an abstraction of this kind. But account must\r\nalso be taken of the _differences_ of related facts. Facts may be so\r\nnearly related as to contain the same kind of a [alpha beta gamma ...],\r\nbut the relation be such that the [alpha beta gamma ...] of the one\r\ndiffer from the [alpha beta gamma ...] of the other only by the number\r\nof equal parts into which they can be divided. Such being the case, if\r\nrules can be given for deducing _from one another_ the numbers which are\r\nthe measures of these [alpha beta gamma ...], then we possess in such\r\nrules the _most general_ expression of a group of facts, as also that\r\nexpression which corresponds to all its differences. This is the goal of\r\nquantitative investigation.\r\n\r\nIf this goal be reached what we have found is that between the [alpha\r\nbeta gamma ...] of a group of facts, or better, between the numbers\r\nwhich are their measures, a number of equations exists. The simple fact\r\nof change brings it about that the number of these equations must be\r\nsmaller than the number of the [alpha beta gamma ...]. If the former be\r\nsmaller by one than the latter, then one portion of the [alpha beta\r\ngamma ...] is _uniquely_ determined by the other portion.\r\n\r\nThe quest of relations of this last kind is the most important function\r\nof special experimental research, because we are enabled by it to\r\ncomplete in thought facts that are only partly given. It is self-evident\r\nthat only experience can ascertain that between the [alpha beta gamma\r\n...] relations exist and of what kind they are. Further, only experience\r\ncan tell that the relations that exist between the [alpha beta gamma\r\n...] are such that changes of them can be reversed. If this were not the\r\nfact all occasion for the enunciation of the principle of energy, as is\r\neasily seen, would be wanting. In experience, therefore, is buried the\r\nultimate well-spring of all knowledge of nature, and consequently, in\r\nthis sense, also the ultimate source of the principle of energy.\r\n\r\nBut this does not exclude the fact that the principle of energy has also\r\na logical root, as will now be shown. Let us assume on the basis of\r\nexperience that one group of sensuous elements [alpha beta gamma ...]\r\ndetermines _uniquely_ another group [lambda mu nu ...]. Experience\r\nfurther teaches that changes of [alpha beta gamma ...] can be\r\n_reversed_. It is then a logical consequence of this observation, that\r\nevery time that [alpha beta gamma ...] assume the same values this is\r\nalso the case with [lambda mu nu ...]. Or, that purely _periodical_\r\nchanges of [alpha beta gamma ...] can produce no _permanent_ changes of\r\n[lambda mu nu ...]. If the group [lambda mu nu ...] is a mechanical\r\ngroup, then a perpetual motion is excluded.\r\n\r\nIt will be said that this is a vicious circle, which we will grant. But\r\npsychologically, the situation is essentially different, whether I think\r\nsimply of the unique determination and reversibility of events, or\r\nwhether I exclude a perpetual motion. The attention takes in the two\r\ncases different directions and diffuses light over different sides of\r\nthe question, which logically of course are necessarily connected.\r\n\r\nSurely that firm, logical setting of the thoughts noticeable in the\r\ngreat inquirers, Stevinus, Galileo, and the rest, which, consciously or\r\ninstinctively, was supported by a fine feeling for the slightest\r\ncontradictions, has no other purpose than to limit the bounds of thought\r\nand so exempt it from the possibility of error. In this, therefore, the\r\nlogical root of the principle of excluded perpetual motion is given,\r\nnamely, in that universal conviction which existed even before the\r\ndevelopment of mechanics and co-operated in that development.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly natural that the principle of excluded perpetual motion\r\nshould have been first developed in the simple domain of pure mechanics.\r\nTowards the transference of that principle into the domain of general\r\nphysics the idea contributed much that all physical phenomena are\r\nmechanical phenomena. But the foregoing discussion shows how little\r\nessential this notion is. The issue really involved is the recognition\r\nof a general interconnexion of nature. This once established, we see\r\nwith Carnot that it is indifferent whether the mechanical laws are\r\nbroken directly or circuitously.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the excluded perpetual motion is very closely related\r\nto the modern principle of energy, but it is not identical with it, for\r\nthe latter is to be deduced from the former only by means of a definite\r\n_formal conception_. As may be seen from the preceding exposition, the\r\nperpetual motion can be excluded without our employing or possessing the\r\nnotion of _work_. The modern principle of energy results primarily from\r\na _substantial_ conception of work and of every change of physical\r\ncondition which by being reversed produces work. The strong need of such\r\na conception, which is by no means necessary, but in a formal sense is\r\nvery convenient and lucid, is exhibited in the case of J. R. Mayer and\r\nJoule. It was before remarked that this conception was suggested to both\r\ninquirers by the observation that both the production of heat and the\r\nproduction of mechanical work were connected with an expenditure of\r\nsubstance. Mayer says: \"Ex nihilo nil fit,\" and in another place, \"The\r\ncreation or destruction of a force (work) lies without the province of\r\nhuman activity.\" In Joule we find this passage: \"It is manifestly\r\n_absurd_ to suppose that the powers with which God has endowed matter\r\ncan be destroyed.\"\r\n\r\nSome writers have observed in such statements the attempt at a\r\n_metaphysical_ establishment of the doctrine of energy. But we see in\r\nthem simply the formal need of a simple, clear, and living grasp of the\r\nfacts, which receives its development in practical and technical life,\r\nand which we carry over, as best we can, into the province of science.\r\nAs a fact, Mayer writes to Griesinger: \"If, finally, you ask me how I\r\nbecame involved in the whole affair, my answer is simply this: Engaged\r\nduring a sea voyage almost exclusively with the study of physiology, I\r\ndiscovered the new theory for the sufficient reason that I _vividly felt\r\nthe need of it_.\"\r\n\r\nThe substantial conception of work (energy) is by no means a necessary\r\none. And it is far from true that the problem is solved with the\r\nrecognition of the need of such a conception. Rather let us see how\r\nMayer gradually endeavored to satisfy that need. He first regards\r\nquantity of motion, or momentum, _mv_, as the equivalent of work, and\r\ndid not light, until later, on the notion of living force (_mv²/2_). In\r\nthe province of electricity he was unable to assign the expression which\r\nis the equivalent of work. This was done later by Helmholtz. The formal\r\nneed, therefore, is _first_ present, and our conception of nature is\r\nsubsequently gradually _adapted_ to it.\r\n\r\nThe laying bare of the experimental, logical, and formal root of the\r\npresent principle of energy will perhaps contribute much to the removal\r\nof the mysticism which still clings to this principle. With respect to\r\nour formal need of a very simple, palpable, substantial conception of\r\nthe processes in our environment, it remains an open question how far\r\nnature corresponds to that need, or how far we can satisfy it. In one\r\nphase of the preceding discussions it would seem as if the substantial\r\nnotion of the principle of energy, like Black's material conception of\r\nheat, has its natural limits in facts, beyond which it can only be\r\nartificially adhered to.\r\n\r\n  FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 39: Published in Vol. 5, No. I, of _The Monist_, October,\r\n  1894, being in part a re-elaboration of the treatise _Ueber die\r\n  Erhaltung der Arbeit_, Prague, 1872.]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 40: _On Matter, Living Force, and Heat_, Joule:\r\n  _Scientific Papers_, London, 1884, I, p. 265.]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 41: \"Atqui hoc si sit, globorum series sive corona eundem\r\n  situm cum priore habebit, eademque de causa octo globi sinistri\r\n  ponderosiores erunt sex dextris, ideoque rursus octo illi\r\n  descendent, sex illi ascendent, istique globi ex sese _continuum et\r\n  aeternum motum efficient, quod est falsum_.\"]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 42: \"A igitur, (si ullo modo per naturam fieri possit)\r\n  locum sibi tributum non servato, ac delabatur in _D_; quibus positis\r\n  aqua quae ipsi _A_ succedit eandem ob causam deffluet in _D_, eademque\r\n  ab alia istinc expelletur, atque adeo aqua haec (cum ubique eadem\r\n  ratio sit) _motum instituet perpetuum, quod absurdum fuerit_.\"]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 43: \"Accipio, gradus velocitatis ejusdem mobilis super\r\n  diversas planorum inclinationes acquisitos tunc esse aequales, cum\r\n  eorundum planorum elevationes aequales sint.\"]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 44: \"Voi molto probabilmente discorrete, ma oltre al veri\r\n  simile voglio con una esperienza crescer tanto la probabilità, che\r\n  poco gli manchi all'agguagliarsi ad una ben necessaria\r\n  dimostrazione.

Hence that tendency, expressed in the\r\nphilosophy of all times, to compass by a few organic thoughts the\r\nfundamental features of reality. \"Life understands not death, nor death\r\nlife.\" So spake an old Chinese philosopher. Yet in his unceasing desire\r\nto diminish the boundaries of the incomprehensible, man has always been\r\nengaged in attempts to understand death by life and life by death.\r\n\r\nAmong the ancient civilised peoples, nature was filled with demons and\r\nspirits having the feelings and desires of men. In all essential\r\nfeatures, this animistic view of nature, as Tylor[61] has aptly termed\r\nit, is shared in common by the fetish-worshipper of modern Africa and\r\nthe most advanced nations of antiquity. As a theory of the world it has\r\nnever completely disappeared. The monotheism of the Christians never\r\nfully overcame it, no more than did that of the Jews. In the belief in\r\nwitchcraft and in the superstitions of the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies, the centuries of the rise of natural science, it assumed\r\nfrightful pathological dimensions. Whilst Stevinus, Kepler, and Galileo\r\nwere slowly rearing the fabric of modern physical science, a cruel and\r\nrelentless war was waged with firebrand and rack against the devils that\r\nglowered from every corner. To-day even, apart from all survivals of\r\nthat period, apart from the traces of fetishism which still inhere in\r\nour physical concepts,[62] those very ideas still covertly lurk in the\r\npractices of modern spiritualism.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the side of this animistic conception of the world, we meet from time\r\nto time, in different forms, from Democritus to the present day, another\r\nview, which likewise claims exclusive competency to comprehend the\r\nuniverse. This view may be characterised as the _physico-mechanical_\r\nview of the world. To-day, that view holds, indisputably, the first\r\nplace in the thoughts of men, and determines the ideals and the\r\ncharacter of our times. The coming of the mind of man into the full\r\nconsciousness of its powers, in the eighteenth century, was a period of\r\ngenuine disillusionment. It produced the splendid precedent of a life\r\nreally worthy of man, competent to overcome the old barbarism in the\r\npractical fields of life; it created the _Critique of Pure Reason_,\r\nwhich banished into the realm of shadows the sham-ideas of the old\r\nmetaphysics; it pressed into the hands of the mechanical philosophy the\r\nreins which it now holds.\r\n\r\nThe oft-quoted words of the great Laplace,[63] which I will now give,\r\nhave the ring of a jubilant toast to the scientific achievements of the\r\neighteenth century: \"A mind to which were given for a single instant all\r\nthe forces of nature and the mutual positions of all its masses, if it\r\nwere otherwise powerful enough to subject these problems to analysis,\r\ncould grasp, with a single formula, the motions of the largest masses as\r\nwell as of the smallest atoms; nothing would be uncertain for it; the\r\nfuture and the past would lie revealed before its eyes.\" In writing\r\nthese words, Laplace, as we know, had also in mind the atoms of the\r\nbrain. That idea has been expressed more forcibly still by some of his\r\nfollowers, and it is not too much to say that Laplace's ideal is\r\nsubstantially that of the great majority of modern scientists.\r\n\r\nGladly do we accord to the creator of the _Mécanique céleste_ the sense\r\nof lofty pleasure awakened in him by the great success of the\r\nEnlightenment, to which we too owe our intellectual freedom. But to-day,\r\nwith minds undisturbed and before _new_ tasks, it becomes physical\r\nscience to secure itself against self-deception by a careful study of\r\nits character, so that it can pursue with greater sureness its true\r\nobjects. If I step, therefore, beyond the narrow precincts of my\r\nspecialty in this discussion, to trespass on friendly neighboring\r\ndomains, I may plead in my excuse that the subject-matter of knowledge\r\nis common to all domains of research, and that fixed, sharp lines of\r\ndemarcation cannot be drawn.\r\n\r\nThe belief in occult magic powers of nature has gradually died away, but\r\nin its place a new belief has arisen, the belief in the magical power of\r\nscience. Science throws her treasures, not like a capricious fairy into\r\nthe laps of a favored few, but into the laps of all humanity, with a\r\nlavish extravagance that no legend ever dreamt of! Not without apparent\r\njustice, therefore, do her distant admirers impute to her the power of\r\nopening up unfathomable abysses of nature, to which the senses cannot\r\npenetrate. Yet she who came to bring light into the world, can well\r\ndispense with the darkness of mystery, and with pompous show, which she\r\nneeds neither for the justification of her aims nor for the adornment of\r\nher plain achievements.\r\n\r\nThe homely beginnings of science will best reveal to us its simple,\r\nunchangeable character. Man acquires his first knowledge of nature\r\nhalf-consciously and automatically, from an instinctive habit of\r\nmimicking and forecasting facts in thought, of supplementing sluggish\r\nexperience with the swift wings of thought, at first only for his\r\nmaterial welfare. When he hears a noise in the underbrush he constructs\r\nthere, just as the animal does, the enemy which he fears; when he sees a\r\ncertain rind he forms mentally the image of the fruit which he is in\r\nsearch of; just as we mentally associate a certain kind of matter with a\r\ncertain line in the spectrum or an electric spark with the friction of a\r\npiece of glass. A knowledge of causality in this form certainly reaches\r\nfar below the level of Schopenhauer's pet dog, to whom it was ascribed.\r\nIt probably exists in the whole animal world, and confirms that great\r\nthinker's statement regarding the will which created the intellect for\r\nits purposes. These primitive psychical functions are rooted in the\r\neconomy of our organism not less firmly than are motion and digestion.\r\nWho would deny that we feel in them, too, the elemental power of a long\r\npractised logical and physiological activity, bequeathed to us as an\r\nheirloom from our forefathers?\r\n\r\nSuch primitive acts of knowledge constitute to-day the solidest\r\nfoundation of scientific thought. Our instinctive knowledge, as we shall\r\nbriefly call it, by virtue of the conviction that we have consciously\r\nand intentionally contributed nothing to its formation, confronts us\r\nwith an authority and logical power which consciously acquired knowledge\r\neven from familiar sources and of easily tested fallibility can never\r\npossess. All so-called axioms are such instinctive knowledge. Not\r\nconsciously gained knowledge alone, but powerful intellectual instinct,\r\njoined with vast conceptive powers, constitute the great inquirer. The\r\ngreatest advances of science have always consisted in some successful\r\nformulation, in clear, abstract, and communicable terms, of what was\r\ninstinctively known long before, and of thus making it the permanent\r\nproperty of humanity. By Newton's principle of the equality of pressure\r\nand counterpressure, whose truth all before him had felt, but which no\r\npredecessor had abstractly formulated, mechanics was placed by a single\r\nstroke on a higher level. Our statement might also be historically\r\njustified by examples from the scientific labors of Stevinus, S. Carnot,\r\nFaraday, J. R. Mayer, and others.\r\n\r\nAll this, however, is merely the soil from which science starts. The\r\nfirst real beginnings of science appear in society, particularly in the\r\nmanual arts, where the necessity for the communication of experience\r\narises. Here, where some new discovery is to be described and related,\r\nthe compulsion is first felt of clearly defining in consciousness the\r\nimportant and essential features of that discovery, as many writers can\r\ntestify. The aim of instruction is simply the saving of experience; the\r\nlabor of one man is made to take the place of that of another.\r\n\r\nThe most wonderful economy of communication is found in language. Words\r\nare comparable to type, which spare the repetition of written signs and\r\nthus serve a multitude of purposes; or to the few sounds of which our\r\nnumberless different words are composed. Language, with its helpmate,\r\nconceptual thought, by fixing the essential and rejecting the\r\nunessential, constructs its rigid pictures of the fluid world on the\r\nplan of a mosaic, at a sacrifice of exactness and fidelity but with a\r\nsaving of tools and labor. Like a piano-player with previously prepared\r\nsounds, a speaker excites in his listener thoughts previously prepared,\r\nbut fitting many cases, which respond to the speaker's summons with\r\nalacrity and little effort.\r\n\r\nThe principles which a prominent political economist, E. Hermann,[64]\r\nhas formulated for the economy of the industrial arts, are also\r\napplicable to the ideas of common life and of science. The economy of\r\nlanguage is augmented, of course, in the terminology of science. With\r\nrespect to the economy of written intercourse there is scarcely a doubt\r\nthat science itself will realise that grand old dream of the\r\nphilosophers of a Universal Real Character. That time is not far\r\ndistant. Our numeral characters, the symbols of mathematical analysis,\r\nchemical symbols, and musical notes, which might easily be supplemented\r\nby a system of color-signs, together with some phonetic alphabets now in\r\nuse, are all beginnings in this direction. The logical extension of what\r\nwe have, joined with a use of the ideas which the Chinese ideography\r\nfurnishes us, will render the special invention and promulgation of a\r\nUniversal Character wholly superfluous.\r\n\r\nThe communication of scientific knowledge always involves description,\r\nthat is, a mimetic reproduction of facts in thought, the object of which\r\nis to replace and save the trouble of new experience. Again, to save the\r\nlabor of instruction and of acquisition, concise, abridged description\r\nis sought. This is really all that natural laws are. Knowing the value\r\nof the acceleration of gravity, and Galileo's laws of descent, we\r\npossess simple and compendious directions for reproducing in thought all\r\npossible motions of falling bodies. A formula of this kind is a complete\r\nsubstitute for a full table of motions of descent, because by means of\r\nthe formula the data of such a table can be easily constructed at a\r\nmoment's notice without the least burdening of the memory.\r\n\r\nNo human mind could comprehend all the individual cases of refraction.\r\nBut knowing the index of refraction for the two media presented, and the\r\nfamiliar law of the sines, we can easily reproduce or fill out in\r\nthought every conceivable case of refraction. The advantage here\r\nconsists in the disburdening of the memory; an end immensely furthered\r\nby the written preservation of the natural constants. More than this\r\ncomprehensive and condensed report about facts is not contained in a\r\nnatural law of this sort. In reality, the law always contains less than\r\nthe fact itself, because it does not reproduce the fact as a whole but\r\nonly in that aspect of it which is important for us, the rest being\r\neither intentionally or from necessity omitted. Natural laws may be\r\nlikened to intellectual type of a higher order, partly movable, partly\r\nstereotyped, which last on new editions of experience may become\r\ndownright impediments.\r\n\r\nWhen we look over a province of facts for the first time, it appears to\r\nus diversified, irregular, confused, full of contradictions. We first\r\nsucceed in grasping only single facts, unrelated with the others. The\r\nprovince, as we are wont to say, is not _clear_. By and by we discover\r\nthe simple, permanent elements of the mosaic, out of which we can\r\nmentally construct the whole province. When we have reached a point\r\nwhere we can discover everywhere the same facts, we no longer feel lost\r\nin this province; we comprehend it without effort; it is _explained_ for\r\nus.\r\n\r\nLet me illustrate this by an example. As soon as we have grasped the\r\nfact of the rectilinear propagation of light, the regular course of our\r\nthoughts stumbles at the phenomena of refraction and diffraction. As\r\nsoon as we have cleared matters up by our index of refraction we\r\ndiscover that a special index is necessary for each color. Soon after we\r\nhave accustomed ourselves to the fact that light added to light\r\nincreases its intensity, we suddenly come across a case of total\r\ndarkness produced by this cause. Ultimately, however, we see everywhere\r\nin the overwhelming multifariousness of optical phenomena the fact of\r\nthe spatial and temporal periodicity of light, with its velocity of\r\npropagation dependent on the medium and the period. This tendency of\r\nobtaining a survey of a given province with the least expenditure of\r\nthought, and of representing all its facts by some one single mental\r\nprocess, may be justly termed an economical one.\r\n\r\nThe greatest perfection of mental economy is attained in that science\r\nwhich has reached the highest formal development, and which is widely\r\nemployed in physical inquiry, namely, in mathematics. Strange as it\r\nmay sound, the power of mathematics rests upon its evasion of\r\nall unnecessary thought and on its wonderful saving of mental\r\noperations. Even those arrangement-signs which we call numbers are a\r\nsystem of marvellous simplicity and economy. When we employ the\r\nmultiplication-table in multiplying numbers of several places, and so\r\nuse the results of old operations of counting instead of performing the\r\nwhole of each operation anew; when we consult our table of logarithms,\r\nreplacing and saving thus new calculations by old ones already\r\nperformed; when we employ determinants instead of always beginning\r\nafresh the solution of a system of equations; when we resolve new\r\nintegral expressions into familiar old integrals; we see in this simply\r\na feeble reflexion of the intellectual activity of a Lagrange or a\r\nCauchy, who, with the keen discernment of a great military commander,\r\nsubstituted for new operations whole hosts of old ones. No one will\r\ndispute me when I say that the most elementary as well as the highest\r\nmathematics are economically-ordered experiences of counting, put in\r\nforms ready for use.\r\n\r\nIn algebra we perform, as far as possible, all numerical operations\r\nwhich are identical in form once for all, so that only a remnant of work\r\nis left for the individual case. The use of the signs of algebra and\r\nanalysis, which are merely symbols of operations to be performed, is due\r\nto the observation that we can materially disburden the mind in this way\r\nand spare its powers for more important and more difficult duties, by\r\nimposing all mechanical operations upon the hand. One result of this\r\nmethod, which attests its economical character, is the construction of\r\ncalculating machines. The mathematician Babbage, the inventor of the\r\ndifference-engine, was probably the first who clearly perceived this\r\nfact, and he touched upon it, although only cursorily, in his work, _The\r\nEconomy of Manufactures and Machinery_.\r\n\r\nThe student of mathematics often finds it hard to throw off the\r\nuncomfortable feeling that his science, in the person of his pencil,\r\nsurpasses him in intelligence,--an impression which the great Euler\r\nconfessed he often could not get rid of. This feeling finds a sort of\r\njustification when we reflect that the majority of the ideas we deal\r\nwith were conceived by others, often centuries ago. In great measure it\r\nis really the intelligence of other people that confronts us in science.\r\nThe moment we look at matters in this light, the uncanniness and magical\r\ncharacter of our impressions cease, especially when we remember that we\r\ncan think over again at will any one of those alien thoughts.\r\n\r\nPhysics is experience, arranged in economical order. By this order not\r\nonly is a broad and comprehensive view of what we have rendered\r\npossible, but also the defects and the needful alterations are made\r\nmanifest, exactly as in a well-kept household. Physics shares with\r\nmathematics the advantages of succinct description and of brief,\r\ncompendious definition, which precludes confusion, even in ideas where,\r\nwith no apparent burdening of the brain, hosts of others are contained.\r\nOf these ideas the rich contents can be produced at any moment and\r\ndisplayed in their full perceptual light. Think of the swarm of\r\nwell-ordered notions pent up in the idea of the potential. Is it\r\nwonderful that ideas containing so much finished labor should be easy to\r\nwork with?\r\n\r\nOur first knowledge, thus, is a product of the economy of\r\nself-preservation. By communication, the experience of _many_ persons,\r\nindividually acquired at first, is collected in _one_. The communication\r\nof knowledge and the necessity which every one feels of managing his\r\nstock of experience with the least expenditure of thought, compel us to\r\nput our knowledge in economical forms. But here we have a clue which\r\nstrips science of all its mystery, and shows us what its power really\r\nis. With respect to specific results it yields us nothing that we could\r\nnot reach in a sufficiently long time without methods. There is no\r\nproblem in all mathematics that cannot be solved by direct counting. But\r\nwith the present implements of mathematics many operations of counting\r\ncan be performed in a few minutes which without mathematical methods\r\nwould take a lifetime. Just as a single human being, restricted wholly\r\nto the fruits of his own labor, could never amass a fortune, but on the\r\ncontrary the accumulation of the labor of many men in the hands of one\r\nis the foundation of wealth and power, so, also, no knowledge worthy of\r\nthe name can be gathered up in a single human mind limited to the span\r\nof a human life and gifted only with finite powers, except by the most\r\nexquisite economy of thought and by the careful amassment of the\r\neconomically ordered experience of thousands of co-workers. What strikes\r\nus here as the fruits of sorcery are simply the rewards of excellent\r\nhousekeeping, as are the like results in civil life. But the business of\r\nscience has this advantage over every other enterprise, that from _its_\r\namassment of wealth no one suffers the least loss. This, too, is its\r\nblessing, its freeing and saving power.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of the economical character of science will now help us,\r\nperhaps, to understand better certain physical notions.\r\n\r\nThose elements of an event which we call \"cause and effect\" are certain\r\nsalient features of it, which are important for its mental reproduction.\r\nTheir importance wanes and the attention is transferred to fresh\r\ncharacters the moment the event or experience in question becomes\r\nfamiliar. If the connexion of such features strikes us as a necessary\r\none, it is simply because the interpolation of certain intermediate\r\nlinks with which we are very familiar, and which possess, therefore,\r\nhigher authority for us, is often attended with success in our\r\nexplanations. That _ready_ experience fixed in the mosaic of the mind\r\nwith which we meet new events, Kant calls an innate concept of the\r\nunderstanding (_Verstandesbegriff_).\r\n\r\nThe grandest principles of physics, resolved into their elements, differ\r\nin no wise from the descriptive principles of the natural historian. The\r\nquestion, \"Why?\" which is always appropriate where the explanation of a\r\ncontradiction is concerned, like all proper habitudes of thought, can\r\noverreach itself and be asked where nothing remains to be understood.\r\nSuppose we were to attribute to nature the property of producing like\r\neffects in like circumstances; just these like circumstances we should\r\nnot know how to find. Nature exists once only. Our schematic mental\r\nimitation alone produces like events. Only in the mind, therefore, does\r\nthe mutual dependence of certain features exist.\r\n\r\nAll our efforts to mirror the world in thought would be futile if we\r\nfound nothing permanent in the varied changes of things. It is this that\r\nimpels us to form the notion of substance, the source of which is not\r\ndifferent from that of the modern ideas relative to the conservation of\r\nenergy. The history of physics furnishes numerous examples of this\r\nimpulse in almost all fields, and pretty examples of it may be traced\r\nback to the nursery. \"Where does the light go to when it is put out?\"\r\nasks the child. The sudden shrivelling up of a hydrogen balloon is\r\ninexplicable to a child; it looks everywhere for the large body which\r\nwas just there but is now gone.\r\n\r\nWhere does heat come from? Where does heat go to? Such childish\r\nquestions in the mouths of mature men shape the character of a century.\r\n\r\nIn mentally separating a body from the changeable environment in which\r\nit moves, what we really do is to extricate a group of sensations on\r\nwhich our thoughts are fastened and which is of relatively greater\r\nstability than the others, from the stream of all our sensations.\r\nAbsolutely unalterable this group is not. Now this, now that member of\r\nit appears and disappears, or is altered. In its full identity it never\r\nrecurs. Yet the sum of its constant elements as compared with the sum of\r\nits changeable ones, especially if we consider the continuous character\r\nof the transition, is always so great that for the purpose in hand the\r\nformer usually appear sufficient to determine the body's identity. But\r\nbecause we can separate from the group every single member without the\r\nbody's ceasing to be for us the same, we are easily led to believe that\r\nafter abstracting all the members something additional would remain. It\r\nthus comes to pass that we form the notion of a substance distinct from\r\nits attributes, of a thing-in-itself, whilst our sensations are regarded\r\nmerely as symbols or indications of the properties of this\r\nthing-in-itself. But it would be much better to say that bodies or\r\nthings are compendious mental symbols for groups of sensations--symbols\r\nthat do not exist outside of thought. Thus, the merchant regards the\r\nlabels of his boxes merely as indexes of their contents, and not the\r\ncontrary. He invests their contents, not their labels, with real value.\r\nThe same economy which induces us to analyse a group and to establish\r\nspecial signs for its component parts, parts which also go to make up\r\nother groups, may likewise induce us to mark out by some single symbol a\r\nwhole group.\r\n\r\nOn the old Egyptian monuments we see objects represented which do not\r\nreproduce a single visual impression, but are composed of various\r\nimpressions. The heads and the legs of the figures appear in profile,\r\nthe head-dress and the breast are seen from the front, and so on. We\r\nhave here, so to speak, a mean view of the objects, in forming which the\r\nsculptor has retained what he deemed essential, and neglected what he\r\nthought indifferent. We have living exemplifications of the processes\r\nput into stone on the walls of these old temples, in the drawings of our\r\nchildren, and we also observe a faithful analogue of them in the\r\nformation of ideas in our own minds. Only in virtue of some such\r\nfacility of view as that indicated, are we allowed to speak of a body.\r\nWhen we speak of a cube with trimmed corners--a figure which is not a\r\ncube--we do so from a natural instinct of economy, which prefers to add\r\nto an old familiar conception a correction instead of forming an\r\nentirely new one. This is the process of all judgment.\r\n\r\nThe crude notion of \"body\" can no more stand the test of analysis than\r\ncan the art of the Egyptians or that of our little children. The\r\nphysicist who sees a body flexed, stretched, melted, and vaporised, cuts\r\nup this body into smaller permanent parts; the chemist splits it up into\r\nelements. Yet even an element is not unalterable. Take sodium. When\r\nwarmed, the white, silvery mass becomes a liquid, which, when the heat\r\nis increased and the air shut out, is transformed into a violet vapor,\r\nand on the heat being still more increased glows with a yellow light. If\r\nthe name sodium is still retained, it is because of the continuous\r\ncharacter of the transitions and from a necessary instinct of economy.\r\nBy condensing the vapor, the white metal may be made to reappear.\r\nIndeed, even after the metal is thrown into water and has passed into\r\nsodium hydroxide, the vanished properties may by skilful treatment still\r\nbe made to appear; just as a moving body which has passed behind a\r\ncolumn and is lost to view for a moment may make its appearance after a\r\ntime. It is unquestionably very convenient always to have ready the name\r\nand thought for a group of properties wherever that group by any\r\npossibility can appear. But more than a compendious economical symbol\r\nfor these phenomena, that name and thought is not. It would be a mere\r\nempty word for one in whom it did not awaken a large group of\r\nwell-ordered sense-impressions. And the same is true of the molecules\r\nand atoms into which the chemical element is still further analysed.\r\n\r\nTrue, it is customary to regard the conservation of weight, or, more\r\nprecisely, the conservation of mass, as a direct proof of the constancy\r\nof matter. But this proof is dissolved, when we go to the bottom of it,\r\ninto such a multitude of instrumental and intellectual operations, that\r\nin a sense it will be found to constitute simply an equation which our\r\nideas in imitating facts have to satisfy. That obscure, mysterious lump\r\nwhich we involuntarily add in thought, we seek for in vain outside the\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nIt is always, thus, the crude notion of substance that is slipping\r\nunnoticed into science, proving itself constantly insufficient, and ever\r\nunder the necessity of being reduced to smaller and smaller\r\nworld-particles. Here, as elsewhere, the lower stage is not rendered\r\nindispensable by the higher which is built upon it, no more than the\r\nsimplest mode of locomotion, walking, is rendered superfluous by the\r\nmost elaborate means of transportation. Body, as a compound of light and\r\ntouch sensations, knit together by sensations of space, must be as\r\nfamiliar to the physicist who seeks it, as to the animal who hunts its\r\nprey. But the student of the theory of knowledge, like the geologist and\r\nthe astronomer, must be permitted to reason back from the forms which\r\nare created before his eyes to others which he finds ready made for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAll physical ideas and principles are succinct directions, frequently\r\ninvolving subordinate directions, for the employment of economically\r\nclassified experiences, ready for use. Their conciseness, as also the\r\nfact that their contents are rarely exhibited in full, often invests\r\nthem with the semblance of independent existence. Poetical myths\r\nregarding such ideas,--for example, that of Time, the producer and\r\ndevourer of all things,--do not concern us here. We need only remind the\r\nreader that even Newton speaks of an _absolute_ time independent of all\r\nphenomena, and of an absolute space--views which even Kant did not shake\r\noff, and which are often seriously entertained to-day. For the natural\r\ninquirer, determinations of time are merely abbreviated statements of\r\nthe dependence of one event upon another, and nothing more. When we say\r\nthe acceleration of a freely falling body is 9·810 metres per second, we\r\nmean the velocity of the body with respect to the centre of the earth is\r\n9·810 metres greater when the earth has performed an additional 86400th\r\npart of its rotation--a fact which itself can be determined only by the\r\nearth's relation to other heavenly bodies. Again, in velocity is\r\ncontained simply a relation of the position of a body to the position of\r\nthe earth.[65] Instead of referring events to the earth we may refer\r\nthem to a clock, or even to our internal sensation of time. Now, because\r\nall are connected, and each may be made the measure of the rest, the\r\nillusion easily arises that time has significance independently of\r\nall.[66]\r\n\r\nThe aim of research is the discovery of the equations which subsist\r\nbetween the elements of phenomena. The equation of an ellipse expresses\r\nthe universal _conceivable_ relation between its co-ordinates, of which\r\nonly the real values have _geometrical_ significance. Similarly, the\r\nequations between the elements of _phenomena_ express a universal,\r\nmathematically conceivable relation. Here, however, for many values only\r\ncertain directions of change are _physically_ admissible. As in the\r\nellipse only certain _values_ satisfying the equation are realised, so\r\nin the physical world only certain _changes_ of value occur. Bodies are\r\nalways accelerated towards the earth. Differences of temperature, left\r\nto themselves, always grow less; and so on. Similarly, with respect to\r\nspace, mathematical and physiological researches have shown that the\r\nspace of experience is simply an _actual_ case of many conceivable\r\ncases, about whose peculiar properties experience alone can instruct us.\r\nThe elucidation which this idea diffuses cannot be questioned, despite\r\nthe absurd uses to which it has been put.\r\n\r\nLet us endeavor now to summarise the results of our survey. In the\r\neconomical schematism of science lie both its strength and its weakness.\r\nFacts are always represented at a sacrifice of completeness and never\r\nwith greater precision than fits the needs of the moment. The\r\nincongruence between thought and experience, therefore, will continue to\r\nsubsist as long as the two pursue their course side by side; but it will\r\nbe continually diminished.\r\n\r\nIn reality, the point involved is always the completion of some partial\r\nexperience; the derivation of one portion of a phenomenon from some\r\nother. In this act our ideas must be based directly upon sensations. We\r\ncall this measuring.[67] The condition of science, both in its origin\r\nand in its application, is a _great relative stability_ of our\r\nenvironment. What it teaches us is interdependence. Absolute forecasts,\r\nconsequently, have no significance in science. With great changes in\r\ncelestial space we should lose our co-ordinate systems of space and\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWhen a geometer wishes to understand the form of a curve, he first\r\nresolves it into small rectilinear elements. In doing this, however, he\r\nis fully aware that these elements are only provisional and arbitrary\r\ndevices for comprehending in parts what he cannot comprehend as a whole.\r\nWhen the law of the curve is found he no longer thinks of the elements.\r\nSimilarly, it would not become physical science to see in its\r\nself-created, changeable, economical tools, molecules and atoms,\r\nrealities behind phenomena, forgetful of the lately acquired sapience of\r\nher older sister, philosophy, in substituting a mechanical mythology for\r\nthe old animistic or metaphysical scheme, and thus creating no end of\r\nsuppositious problems. The atom must remain a tool for representing\r\nphenomena, like the functions of mathematics. Gradually, however, as the\r\nintellect, by contact with its subject-matter, grows in discipline,\r\nphysical science will give up its mosaic play with stones and will seek\r\nout the boundaries and forms of the bed in which the living stream of\r\nphenomena flows. The goal which it has set itself is the _simplest_ and\r\n_most economical_ abstract expression of facts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe question now remains, whether the same method of research which till\r\nnow we have tacitly restricted to physics, is also applicable in the\r\npsychical domain. This question will appear superfluous to the physical\r\ninquirer. Our physical and psychical views spring in exactly the same\r\nmanner from instinctive knowledge. We read the thoughts of men in their\r\nacts and facial expressions without knowing how. Just as we predict the\r\nbehavior of a magnetic needle placed near a current by imagining\r\nAmpère's swimmer in the current, similarly we predict in thought the\r\nacts and behavior of men by assuming sensations, feelings, and wills\r\nsimilar to our own connected with their bodies. What we here\r\ninstinctively perform would appear to us as one of the subtlest\r\nachievements of science, far outstripping in significance and ingenuity\r\nAmpère's rule of the swimmer, were it not that every child unconsciously\r\naccomplished it. The question simply is, therefore, to grasp\r\nscientifically, that is, by conceptional thought, what we are already\r\nfamiliar with from other sources. And here much is to be accomplished. A\r\nlong sequence of facts is to be disclosed between the physics of\r\nexpression and movement and feeling and thought.\r\n\r\nWe hear the question, \"But how is it possible to explain feeling by the\r\nmotions of the atoms of the brain?\" Certainly this will never be done,\r\nno more than light or heat will ever be deduced from the law of\r\nrefraction. We need not deplore, therefore, the lack of ingenious\r\nsolutions of this question. The problem is not a problem. A child\r\nlooking over the walls of a city or of a fort into the moat below sees\r\nwith astonishment living people in it, and not knowing of the portal\r\nwhich connects the wall with the moat, cannot understand how they could\r\nhave got down from the high ramparts. So it is with the notions of\r\nphysics. We cannot climb up into the province of psychology by the\r\nladder of our abstractions, but we can climb down into it.\r\n\r\nLet us look at the matter without bias. The world consists of colors,\r\nsounds, temperatures, pressures, spaces, times, and so forth, which now\r\nwe shall not call sensations, nor phenomena, because in either term an\r\narbitrary, one-sided theory is embodied, but simply _elements_. The\r\nfixing of the flux of these elements, whether mediately or immediately,\r\nis the real object of physical research. As long as, neglecting our own\r\nbody, we employ ourselves with the interdependence of those groups of\r\nelements which, including men and animals, make up _foreign_ bodies, we\r\nare physicists. For example, we investigate the change of the red color\r\nof a body as produced by a change of illumination. But the moment we\r\nconsider the special influence on the red of the elements constituting\r\nour body, outlined by the well-known perspective with head invisible, we\r\nare at work in the domain of physiological psychology. We close our\r\neyes, and the red together with the whole visible world disappears.\r\nThere exists, thus, in the perspective field of every sense a portion\r\nwhich exercises on all the rest a different and more powerful influence\r\nthan the rest upon one another. With this, however, all is said. In the\r\nlight of this remark, we call _all_ elements, in so far as we regard\r\nthem as dependent on this special part (our body), _sensations_. That\r\nthe world is our sensation, in this sense, cannot be questioned. But to\r\nmake a system of conduct out of this provisional conception, and to\r\nabide its slaves, is as unnecessary for us as would be a similar course\r\nfor a mathematician who, in varying a series of variables of a function\r\nwhich were previously assumed to be constant, or in interchanging the\r\nindependent variables, finds his method to be the source of some very\r\nsurprising ideas for him.[68]\r\n\r\nIf we look at the matter in this unbiassed light it will appear\r\nindubitable that the method of physiological psychology is none other\r\nthan that of physics; what is more, that this science is a part of\r\nphysics. Its subject-matter is not different from that of physics. It\r\nwill unquestionably determine the relations the sensations bear to the\r\nphysics of our body. We have already learned from a member of this\r\nacademy (Hering) that in all probability a sixfold manifoldness of the\r\nchemical processes of the visual substance corresponds to the sixfold\r\nmanifoldness of color-sensation, and a threefold manifoldness of the\r\nphysiological processes to the threefold manifoldness of\r\nspace-sensations. The paths of reflex actions and of the will are\r\nfollowed up and disclosed; it is ascertained what region of the brain\r\nsubserves the function of speech, what region the function of\r\nlocomotion, etc. That which still clings to our body, namely, our\r\nthoughts, will, when those investigations are finished, present no\r\ndifficulties new in principle. When experience has once clearly\r\nexhibited these facts and science has marshalled them in economic and\r\nperspicuous order, there is no doubt that we shall _understand_ them.\r\nFor other \"understanding\" than a mental mastery of facts never existed.\r\nScience does not create facts from facts, but simply _orders_ known\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nLet us look, now, a little more closely into the modes of research of\r\nphysiological psychology. We have a very clear idea of how a body moves\r\nin the space encompassing it. With our optical field of sight we are\r\nvery familiar. But we are unable to state, as a rule, how we have come\r\nby an idea, from what corner of our intellectual field of sight it has\r\nentered, or by what region the impulse to a motion is sent forth.\r\nMoreover, we shall never get acquainted with this mental field of view\r\nfrom self-observation alone. Self-observation, in conjunction with\r\nphysiological research, which seeks out physical connexions, can put\r\nthis field of vision in a clear light before us, and will thus first\r\nreally reveal to us our inner man.\r\n\r\nPrimarily, natural science, or physics, in its widest sense, makes us\r\nacquainted with only the firmest connexions of groups of elements.\r\nProvisorily, we may not bestow too much attention on the single\r\nconstituents of those groups, if we are desirous of retaining a\r\ncomprehensible whole. Instead of equations between the primitive\r\nvariables, physics gives us, as much the easiest course, equations\r\nbetween _functions_ of those variables. Physiological psychology teaches\r\nus how to separate the visible, the tangible, and the audible from\r\nbodies--a labor which is subsequently richly requited, as the division\r\nof the subjects of physics well shows. Physiology further analyses the\r\nvisible into light and space sensations; the first into colors, the last\r\nalso into their component parts; it resolves noises into sounds, these\r\ninto tones, and so on. Unquestionably this analysis can be carried much\r\nfurther than it has been. It will be possible in the end to exhibit the\r\ncommon elements at the basis of very abstract but definite logical acts\r\nof like form,--elements which the acute jurist and mathematician, as it\r\nwere, _feels_ out, with absolute certainty, where the uninitiated hears\r\nonly empty words. Physiology, in a word, will reveal to us the true real\r\nelements of the world. Physiological psychology bears to physics in its\r\nwidest sense a relation similar to that which chemistry bears to physics\r\nin its narrowest sense. But far greater than the mutual support of\r\nphysics and chemistry will be that which natural science and psychology\r\nwill render each other. And the results that shall spring from this\r\nunion will, in all likelihood, far outstrip those of the modern\r\nmechanical physics.\r\n\r\nWhat those ideas are with which we shall comprehend the world when the\r\nclosed circuit of physical and psychological facts shall lie complete\r\nbefore us, (that circuit of which we now see only two disjoined parts,)\r\ncannot be foreseen at the outset of the work. The men will be found who\r\nwill see what is right and will have the courage, instead of wandering\r\nin the intricate paths of logical and historical accident, to enter on\r\nthe straight ways to the heights from which the mighty stream of facts\r\ncan be surveyed. Whether the notion which we now call matter will\r\ncontinue to have a scientific significance beyond the crude purposes of\r\ncommon life, we do not know. But we certainly shall wonder how colors\r\nand tones which were such innermost parts of us could suddenly get lost\r\nin our physical world of atoms; how we could be suddenly surprised that\r\nsomething which outside us simply clicked and beat, in our heads should\r\nmake light and music; and how we could ask whether matter can feel, that\r\nis to say, whether a mental symbol for a group of sensations can feel?\r\n\r\nWe cannot mark out in hard and fast lines the science of the future, but\r\nwe can foresee that the rigid walls which now divide man from the world\r\nwill gradually disappear; that human beings will not only confront each\r\nother, but also the entire organic and so-called lifeless world, with\r\nless selfishness and with livelier sympathy. Just such a presentiment as\r\nthis perhaps possessed the great Chinese philosopher Licius some two\r\nthousand years ago when, pointing to a heap of mouldering human bones,\r\nhe said to his scholars in the rigid, lapidary style of his tongue:\r\n\"These and I alone have the knowledge that we neither live nor are\r\ndead.\"\r\n\r\n  FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 60: An address delivered before the anniversary meeting of\r\n  the Imperial Academy of Sciences, at Vienna, May 25, 1882.]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 61: _Primitive Culture._]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 62: Tylor, _loc. cit._]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 63: _Essai philosophique sur les probabilités_. 6th Ed.\r\n  Paris, 1840, p. 4.

The idea, though known to\r\n  philosophers, is unfamiliar to the majority of physicists. It is a\r\n  matter of deep regret to me, therefore, that the title and author of\r\n  a small tract which accorded with my views in numerous details and\r\n  which I remember having caught a glance of in a very busy period\r\n  (1879-1880), have so completely disappeared from my memory that all\r\n  efforts to obtain a clue to them have hitherto been fruitless.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON TRANSFORMATION AND ADAPTATION IN SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT.[69]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was towards the close of the sixteenth century that Galileo with a\r\nsuperb indifference to the dialectic arts and sophistic subtleties of\r\nthe Schoolmen of his time, turned the attention of his brilliant mind to\r\nnature. By nature his ideas were transformed and released from the\r\nfetters of inherited prejudice. At once the mighty revolution was felt,\r\nthat was therewith effected in the realm of human thought--felt indeed\r\nin circles far remote and wholly unrelated to the sphere of science,\r\nfelt in strata of society that hitherto had only indirectly recognised\r\nthe influence of scientific thought.\r\n\r\nAnd how great and how far-reaching that revolution was! From the\r\nbeginning of the seventeenth century till its close we see arising, at\r\nleast in embryo, almost all that plays a part in the natural and\r\ntechnical science of to-day, almost all that in the two centuries\r\nfollowing so wonderfully transformed the facial appearance of the earth,\r\nand all that is moving onward in process of such mighty evolution\r\nto-day. And all this, the direct result of Galilean ideas, the direct\r\noutcome of that freshly awakened sense for the investigation of natural\r\nphenomena which taught the Tuscan philosopher to form the concept and\r\nthe law of falling bodies from the _observation_ of a falling stone!\r\nGalileo began his investigations without an implement worthy of the\r\nname; he measured time in the most primitive way, by the efflux of\r\nwater. Yet soon afterwards the telescope, the microscope, the barometer,\r\nthe thermometer, the air-pump, the steam engine, the pendulum, and the\r\nelectrical machine were invented in rapid succession. The fundamental\r\ntheorems of dynamical science, of optics, of heat, and of electricity\r\nwere all disclosed in the century that followed Galileo.\r\n\r\nOf scarcely less importance, it seems, was that movement which was\r\nprepared for by the illustrious biologists of the hundred years just\r\npast, and formally begun by the late Mr. Darwin. Galileo quickened the\r\nsense for the simpler phenomena of _inorganic_ nature. And with the same\r\nsimplicity and frankness that marked the efforts of Galileo, and without\r\nthe aid of technical or scientific instruments, without physical or\r\nchemical experiment, but solely by the power of thought and observation,\r\nDarwin grasps a new property of _organic_ nature--which we may briefly\r\ncall its _plasticity_.[70] With the same directness of purpose, Darwin,\r\ntoo, pursues his way. With the same candor and love of truth, he points\r\nout the strength and the weakness of his demonstrations. With masterly\r\nequanimity he holds aloof from the discussion of irrelevant subjects and\r\nwins alike the admiration of his adherents and of his adversaries.\r\n\r\nScarcely thirty years have elapsed[71] since Darwin first propounded the\r\nprinciples of his theory of evolution. Yet, already we see his ideas\r\nfirmly rooted in every branch of human thought, however remote.\r\nEverywhere, in history, in philosophy, even in the physical sciences, we\r\nhear the watchwords: heredity, adaptation, selection. We speak of the\r\nstruggle for existence among the heavenly bodies and of the struggle for\r\nexistence in the world of molecules.[72]\r\n\r\nThe impetus given by Galileo to scientific thought was marked in every\r\ndirection; thus, his pupil, Borelli, founded the school of exact\r\nmedicine, from whence proceeded even distinguished mathematicians. And\r\nnow Darwinian ideas, in the same way, are animating all provinces of\r\nresearch. It is true, nature is not made up of two distinct parts, the\r\ninorganic and the organic; nor must these two divisions be treated\r\nperforce by totally distinct methods. Many _sides_, however, nature has.\r\nNature is like a thread in an intricate tangle, which must be followed\r\nand traced, now from this point, now from that. But we must never\r\nimagine,--and this physicists have learned from Faraday and J. R.\r\nMayer,--that progress along paths once entered upon is the _only_ means\r\nof reaching the truth.\r\n\r\nIt will devolve upon the specialists of the future to determine the\r\nrelative tenability and fruitfulness of the Darwinian ideas in the\r\ndifferent provinces. Here I wish simply to consider the growth of\r\nnatural _knowledge_ in the light of the theory of evolution. For\r\nknowledge, too, is a product of organic nature. And although ideas, as\r\nsuch, do not comport themselves in all respects like independent organic\r\nindividuals, and although violent comparisons should be avoided, still,\r\nif Darwin reasoned rightly, the general imprint of evolution and\r\ntransformation must be noticeable in ideas also.\r\n\r\nI shall waive here the consideration of the fruitful topic of the\r\ntransmission of ideas or rather of the transmission of the aptitude for\r\ncertain ideas.[73] Nor would it come within my province to discuss\r\npsychical evolution in any form, as Spencer[74] and many other modern\r\npsychologists have done, with varying success. Neither shall I enter\r\nupon a discussion of the struggle for existence and of natural selection\r\namong scientific theories.[75] We shall consider here only such\r\nprocesses of transformation as every student can easily observe in his\r\nown mind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe child of the forest picks out and pursues with marvellous acuteness\r\nthe trails of animals. He outwits and overreaches his foes with\r\nsurpassing cunning. He is perfectly at home in the sphere of his\r\npeculiar experience. But confront him with an unwonted phenomenon; place\r\nhim face to face with a technical product of modern civilisation, and he\r\nwill lapse into impotency and helplessness. Here are facts which he\r\ndoes not comprehend. If he endeavors to grasp their meaning, he\r\nmisinterprets them. He fancies the moon, when eclipsed, to be tormented\r\nby an evil spirit. To his mind a puffing locomotive is a living monster.\r\nThe letter accompanying a commission with which he is entrusted, having\r\nonce revealed his thievishness, is in his imagination a conscious being,\r\nwhich he must hide beneath a stone, before venturing to commit a fresh\r\ntrespass. Arithmetic to him is like the art of the geomancers in the\r\nArabian Nights,--an art which is able to accomplish every imaginable\r\nimpossibility. And, like Voltaire's _ingénu_, when placed in our social\r\nworld, he plays, as we think, the maddest pranks.\r\n\r\nWith the man who has made the achievements of modern science and\r\ncivilisation his own, the case is quite different. He sees the moon pass\r\ntemporarily into the shadow of the earth. He feels in his thoughts the\r\nwater growing hot in the boiler of the locomotive; he feels also the\r\nincrease of the tension which pushes the piston forward. Where he is not\r\nable to trace the direct relation of things he has recourse to his\r\nyard-stick and table of logarithms, which aid and facilitate his thought\r\nwithout predominating over it. Such opinions as he cannot concur in, are\r\nat least known to him, and he knows how to meet them in argument.\r\n\r\nNow, wherein does the difference between these two men consist? The\r\ntrain of thought habitually employed by the first one does not\r\ncorrespond to the facts that he sees. He is surprised and nonplussed at\r\nevery step. But the thoughts of the second man follow and anticipate\r\nevents, his thoughts have become adapted or accommodated to the larger\r\nfield of observation and activity in which he is located; he conceives\r\nthings as they are. The Indian's sphere of experience, however, is quite\r\ndifferent; his bodily organs of sense are in constant activity; he is\r\never intensely alert and on the watch for his foes; or, his entire\r\nattention and energy are engaged in procuring sustenance. Now, how can\r\nsuch a creature project his mind into futurity, foresee or prophesy?\r\nThis is not possible until our fellow-beings have, in a measure,\r\nrelieved us of our concern for existence. It is then that we acquire\r\nfreedom for observation, and not infrequently too that narrowness of\r\nthought which society helps and teaches us to disregard.\r\n\r\nIf we move for a time within a fixed circle of phenomena which recur\r\nwith unvarying uniformity, our thoughts gradually adapt themselves to\r\nour environment; our ideas reflect unconsciously our surroundings. The\r\nstone we hold in our hand, when dropped, not only falls to the ground in\r\nreality; it also falls in our thoughts. Iron-filings dart towards a\r\nmagnet in imagination as well as in fact, and, when thrown into a fire,\r\nthey grew hot in conception as well.\r\n\r\nThe impulse to complete mentally a phenomenon that has been only\r\npartially observed, has not its origin in the phenomenon itself; of this\r\nfact, we are fully sensible. And we well know that it does not lie\r\nwithin the sphere of our volition. It seems to confront us rather as a\r\npower and a law imposed from without and controlling both thought and\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nThe fact that we are able by the help of this law to prophesy and\r\nforecast, merely proves a sameness or uniformity of environment\r\nsufficient to effect a mental adaptation of this kind. A necessity of\r\nfulfilment, however, is not contained in this compulsory principle which\r\ncontrols our thoughts; nor is it in any way determined by the\r\npossibility of prediction. We are always obliged, in fact, to await the\r\ncompletion of what has been predicted. Errors and departures are\r\nconstantly discernible, and are slight only in provinces of great rigid\r\nconstancy, as in astronomy.\r\n\r\nIn cases where our thoughts follow the connexion of events with ease,\r\nand in instances where we positively forefeel the course of a\r\nphenomenon, it is natural to fancy that the latter is determined by and\r\nmust conform to our thoughts. But the belief in that mysterious agency\r\ncalled _causality_, which holds thought and event in unison, is\r\nviolently shaken when a person first enters a province of inquiry in\r\nwhich he has previously had no experience. Take for instance the strange\r\ninteraction of electric currents and magnets, or the reciprocal action\r\nof currents, which seem to defy all the resources of mechanical science.\r\nLet him be confronted with such phenomena and he will immediately feel\r\nhimself forsaken by his power of prediction; he will bring nothing with\r\nhim into this strange field of events but the hope of soon being able\r\nto adapt his ideas to the new conditions there presented.\r\n\r\nA person constructs from a bone the remaining anatomy of an animal; or\r\nfrom the visible part of a half-concealed wing of a butterfly he infers\r\nand reconstructs the part concealed. He does so with a feeling of\r\nhighest confidence in the accuracy of his results; and in these\r\nprocesses we find nothing preternatural or transcendent. But when\r\nphysicists adapt their thoughts to conform to the dynamical course of\r\nevents in time, we invariably surround their investigations with a\r\nmetaphysical halo; yet these latter adaptations bear quite the same\r\ncharacter as the former, and our only reason for investing them with a\r\nmetaphysical garb, perhaps, is their high practical value.[76]\r\n\r\nLet us consider for a moment what takes place when the field of\r\nobservation to which our ideas have been adapted and now conform,\r\nbecomes enlarged. We had, let us say, always seen heavy bodies sink when\r\ntheir support was taken away; we had also seen, perhaps, that the\r\nsinking of heavier bodies forced lighter bodies upwards. But now we see\r\na lever in action, and we are suddenly struck with the fact that a\r\nlighter body is lifting another of much greater weight. Our customary\r\ntrain of thought demands its rights; the new and unwonted event likewise\r\ndemands its rights. From this conflict between thought and fact the\r\n_problem_ arises; out of this partial contrariety springs the question,\r\n\"Why?\" With the new adaptation to the enlarged field of observation, the\r\nproblem disappears, or, in other words, is solved. In the instance\r\ncited, we must adopt the habit of always considering the mechanical work\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\nThe child just awakening into consciousness of the world, knows no\r\nproblem. The bright flower, the ringing bell, are all new to it; yet it\r\nis surprised at nothing. The out and out Philistine, whose only thoughts\r\nlie in the beaten path of his every-day pursuits, likewise has no\r\nproblems. Everything goes its wonted course, and if perchance a thing go\r\nwrong at times, it is at most a mere object of curiosity and not worth\r\nserious consideration. In fact, the question \"Why?\" loses all warrant in\r\nrelations where we are familiar with every aspect of events. But the\r\ncapable and talented young man has his head full of problems; he has\r\nacquired, to a greater or less degree, certain habitudes of thought, and\r\nat the same time he is constantly observing what is new and unwonted,\r\nand in his case there is no end to the questions, \"Why?\"\r\n\r\nThus, the factor which most promotes scientific thought is the gradual\r\nwidening of the field of experience. We scarcely notice events we are\r\naccustomed to; the latter do not really develop their intellectual\r\nsignificance until placed in contrast with something to which we are\r\nunaccustomed. Things that at home are passed by unnoticed, delight us\r\nwhen abroad, though they may appear in only slightly different forms.\r\nThe sun shines with heightened radiance, the flowers bloom in brighter\r\ncolors, our fellow-men accost us with lighter and happier looks. And,\r\nreturning home, we find even the old familiar scenes more inspiring and\r\nsuggestive than before.\r\n\r\nEvery motive that prompts and stimulates us to modify and transform our\r\nthoughts, proceeds from what is new, uncommon, and not understood.\r\nNovelty excites wonder in persons whose fixed habits of thought are\r\nshaken and disarranged by what they see. But the element of wonder never\r\nlies in the phenomenon or event observed; its place is in the person\r\nobserving. People of more vigorous mental type aim at once at an\r\n_adaptation of thought_ that will conform to what they have observed.\r\nThus does science eventually become the natural foe of the wonderful.\r\nThe sources of the marvellous are unveiled, and surprise gives way to\r\ncalm interpretation.\r\n\r\nLet us consider such a mental transformative process in detail. The\r\ncircumstance that heavy bodies fall to the earth appears perfectly\r\nnatural and regular. But when a person observes that wood floats upon\r\nwater, and that flames and smoke rise in the air, then the contrary of\r\nthe first phenomenon is presented. An olden theory endeavors to explain\r\nthese facts by imputing to substances the power of volition, as that\r\nattribute which is most familiar to man. It asserted that every\r\nsubstance seeks its proper place, heavy bodies tending downwards and\r\nlight ones upwards. It soon turned out, however, that even smoke had\r\nweight, that it, too, sought its place below, and that it was forced\r\nupwards only because of the downward tendency of the air, as wood is\r\nforced to the surface of water because the water exerts the greater\r\ndownward pressure.\r\n\r\nAgain, we see a body thrown into the air. It ascends. How is it that it\r\ndoes not seek its proper place? Why does the velocity of its \"violent\"\r\nmotion decrease as it rises, while that of its \"natural\" fall increases\r\nas it descends. If we mark closely the relation between these two facts,\r\nthe problem will solve itself. We shall see, as Galileo did, that the\r\ndecrease of velocity in rising and the increase of velocity in falling\r\nare one and the same phenomenon, viz., an increase of velocity towards\r\nthe earth. Accordingly, it is not a place that is assigned to the body,\r\nbut an increase of velocity towards the earth.\r\n\r\nBy this idea the movements of heavy bodies are rendered perfectly\r\nfamiliar. Newton, now, firmly grasping this new way of thinking, sees\r\nthe moon and the planets moving in their paths upon principles similar\r\nto those which determine the motion of a projectile thrown into the air.\r\nYet the movements of the planets were marked by peculiarities which\r\ncompelled him once more to modify slightly his customary mode of\r\nthought. The heavenly bodies, or rather the parts composing them, do not\r\nmove with constant accelerations towards each other, but \"attract each\r\nother,\" directly as the mass and inversely as the square of the\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nThis latter notion, which includes the one applying to terrestrial\r\nbodies as a special case, is, as we see, quite different from the\r\nconception from which we started. How limited in scope was the original\r\nidea and to what a multitude of phenomena is not the present one\r\napplicable! Yet there is a trace, after all, of the \"search for place\"\r\nin the expression \"attraction.\" And it would be folly, indeed, for us to\r\navoid, with punctilious dread, this conception of \"attraction\" as\r\nbearing marks of its pedigree. It is the historical base of the\r\nNewtonian conception and it still continues to direct our thoughts in\r\nthe paths so long familiar to us. Thus, the happiest ideas do not fall\r\nfrom heaven, but spring from notions already existing.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, a ray of light was first regarded as a continuous and\r\nhomogeneous straight line. It then became the path of projection for\r\nminute missiles; then an aggregate of the paths of countless different\r\nkinds of missiles. It became periodic; it acquired various sides; and\r\nultimately it even lost its motion in a straight line.\r\n\r\nThe electric current was conceived originally as the flow of a\r\nhypothetical fluid. To this conception was soon added the notion of a\r\nchemical current, the notion of an electric, magnetic, and anisotropic\r\noptical field, intimately connected with the path of the current. And\r\nthe richer a conception becomes in following and keeping pace with\r\nfacts, the better adapted it is to anticipate them.\r\n\r\nAdaptive processes of this kind have no assignable beginning, inasmuch\r\nas every problem that incites to new adaptation, presupposes a fixed\r\nhabitude of thought. Moreover, they have no visible end; in so far as\r\nexperience never ceases. Science, accordingly, stands midway in the\r\nevolutionary process; and science may advantageously direct and promote\r\nthis process, but it can never take its place. That science is\r\ninconceivable the principles of which would enable a person with no\r\nexperience to construct the world of experience, without a knowledge of\r\nit. One might just as well expect to become a great musician, solely by\r\nthe aid of theory, and without musical experience; or to become a\r\npainter by following the directions of a text-book.\r\n\r\nIn glancing over the history of an idea with which we have become\r\nperfectly familiar, we are no longer able to appreciate the full\r\nsignificance of its growth. The deep and vital changes that have been\r\neffected in the course of its evolution, are recognisable only from the\r\nastounding narrowness of view with which great contemporary scientists\r\nhave occasionally opposed each other. Huygens's wave-theory of light was\r\nincomprehensible to Newton, and Newton's idea of universal gravity was\r\nunintelligible to Huygens. But a century afterwards both notions were\r\nreconcilable, even in ordinary minds.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the original creations of pioneer intellects,\r\nunconsciously formed, do not assume a foreign garb; their form is their\r\nown. In them, childlike simplicity is joined to the maturity of manhood,\r\nand they are not to be compared with processes of thought in the average\r\nmind. The latter are carried on as are the acts of persons in the state\r\nof mesmerism, where actions involuntarily follow the images which the\r\nwords of other persons suggest to their minds.\r\n\r\nThe ideas that have become most familiar through long experience, are\r\nthe very ones that intrude themselves into the conception of every new\r\nfact observed. In every instance, thus, they become involved in a\r\nstruggle for self-preservation, and it is just they that are seized by\r\nthe inevitable process of transformation.\r\n\r\nUpon this process rests substantially the method of explaining by\r\nhypothesis new and uncomprehended phenomena. Thus, instead of forming\r\nentirely new notions to explain the movements of the heavenly bodies and\r\nthe phenomena of the tides, we imagine the material particles composing\r\nthe bodies of the universe to possess weight or gravity with respect to\r\none another. Similarly, we imagine electrified bodies to be freighted\r\nwith fluids that attract and repel, or we conceive the space between\r\nthem to be in a state of elastic tension. In so doing, we substitute\r\nfor new ideas distinct and more familiar notions of old\r\nexperience--notions which to a great extent run unimpeded in their\r\ncourses, although they too must suffer partial transformation.\r\n\r\nThe animal cannot construct new members to perform every new function\r\nthat circumstances and fate demand of it. On the contrary it is obliged\r\nto make use of those it already possesses. When a vertebrate animal\r\nchances into an environment where it must learn to fly or swim, an\r\nadditional pair of extremities is not grown for the purpose. On the\r\ncontrary, the animal must adapt and transform a pair that it already\r\nhas.\r\n\r\nThe construction of hypotheses, therefore, is not the product of\r\nartificial scientific methods. This process is unconsciously carried on\r\nin the very infancy of science. Even later, hypotheses do not become\r\ndetrimental and dangerous to progress except when more reliance is\r\nplaced on them than on the facts themselves; when the contents of the\r\nformer are more highly valued than the latter, and when, rigidly\r\nadhering to hypothetical notions, we overestimate the ideas we possess\r\nas compared with those we have to acquire.\r\n\r\nThe extension of our sphere of experience always involves a\r\ntransformation of our ideas. It matters not whether the face of nature\r\nbecomes actually altered, presenting new and strange phenomena, or\r\nwhether these phenomena are brought to light by an intentional or\r\naccidental turn of observation. In fact, all the varied methods of\r\nscientific inquiry and of purposive mental adaptation enumerated by John\r\nStuart Mill, those of observation as well as those of experiment, are\r\nultimately recognisable as forms of one fundamental method, the method\r\nof change, or variation. It is through change of circumstances that the\r\nnatural philosopher learns. This process, however, is by no means\r\nconfined to the investigator of nature. The historian, the philosopher,\r\nthe jurist, the mathematician, the artist, the æsthetician,[77] all\r\nilluminate and unfold their ideas by producing from the rich treasures\r\nof memory similar, but different, cases; thus, they observe and\r\nexperiment in their thoughts. Even if all sense-experience should\r\nsuddenly cease, the events of the days past would meet in different\r\nattitudes in the mind and the process of adaptation would still\r\ncontinue--a process which, in contradistinction to the adaptation of\r\nthoughts to facts in practical spheres, would be strictly theoretical,\r\nbeing an adaptation of thoughts to thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe method of change or variation brings before us like cases of\r\nphenomena, having partly the same and partly different elements. It is\r\nonly by comparing different cases of refracted light at changing angles\r\nof incidence that the common factor, the constancy of the refractive\r\nindex, is disclosed. And only by comparing the refractions of light of\r\ndifferent colors, does the difference, the inequality of the indices of\r\nrefraction, arrest the attention. Comparison based upon change leads the\r\nmind simultaneously to the highest abstractions and to the finest\r\ndistinctions.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, the animal also is able to distinguish between the similar\r\nand dissimilar of two cases. Its consciousness is aroused by a noise or\r\na rustling, and its motor centre is put in readiness. The sight of the\r\ncreature causing the disturbance, will, according to its size, provoke\r\nflight or prompt pursuit; and in the latter case, the more exact\r\ndistinctions will determine the mode of attack. But man alone attains to\r\nthe faculty of voluntary and conscious comparison. Man alone can, by his\r\npower of abstraction, rise, in one moment, to the comprehension of\r\nprinciples like the conservation of mass or the conservation of energy,\r\nand in the next observe and mark the arrangement of the iron lines in\r\nthe spectrum. In thus dealing with the objects of his conceptual life,\r\nhis ideas unfold and expand, like his nervous system, into a widely\r\nramified and organically articulated tree, on which he may follow every\r\nlimb to its farthermost branches, and, when occasion demands, return to\r\nthe trunk from which he started.\r\n\r\nThe English philosopher Whewell has remarked that two things are\r\nrequisite to the formation of science: facts and ideas. Ideas alone lead\r\nto empty speculation; mere facts can yield no organic knowledge. We see\r\nthat all depends upon the capacity of adapting existing notions to fresh\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nOver-readiness to yield to every new fact prevents fixed habits of\r\nthought from arising. Excessively rigid habits of thought impede freedom\r\nof observation. In the struggle, in the compromise between judgment and\r\nprejudgment (prejudice), if we may use the term, our understanding of\r\nthings broadens.\r\n\r\nHabitual judgment, applied to a new case without antecedent tests, we\r\ncall prejudgment or prejudice. Who does not know its terrible power! But\r\nwe think less often of the importance and utility of prejudice.\r\nPhysically, no one could exist, if he had to guide and regulate the\r\ncirculation, respiration, and digestion of his body by conscious and\r\npurposive acts. So, too, no one could exist intellectually if he had to\r\nform judgments on every passing experience, instead of allowing himself\r\nto be controlled by the judgments he has already formed. Prejudice is a\r\nsort of reflex motion in the province of intelligence.\r\n\r\nOn prejudices, that is, on habitual judgments not tested in every case\r\nto which they are applied, reposes a goodly portion of the thought and\r\nwork of the natural scientist. On prejudices reposes most of the conduct\r\nof society. With the sudden disappearance of prejudice society would\r\nhopelessly dissolve. That prince displayed a deep insight into the power\r\nof intellectual habit, who quelled the loud menaces and demands of his\r\nbody-guard for arrears of pay and compelled them to turn about and\r\nmarch, by simply pronouncing the regular word of command; he well knew\r\nthat they would be unable to resist that.\r\n\r\nNot until the discrepancy between habitual judgments and facts becomes\r\ngreat is the investigator implicated in appreciable illusion. Then\r\ntragic complications and catastrophes occur in the practical life of\r\nindividuals and nations--crises where man, placing custom above life,\r\ninstead of pressing it into the service of life, becomes the victim of\r\nhis error. The very power which in intellectual life advances, fosters,\r\nand sustains us, may in other circumstances delude and destroy us.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIdeas are not all of life. They are only momentary efflorescences of\r\nlight, designed to illuminate the paths of the will. But as delicate\r\nreagents on our organic evolution our ideas are of paramount importance.\r\nNo theory can gainsay the vital transformation which we feel taking\r\nplace within us through their agency. Nor is it necessary that we should\r\nhave a proof of this process. We are immediately assured of it.\r\n\r\nThe transformation of ideas thus appears as a part of the general\r\nevolution of life, as a part of its adaptation to a constantly widening\r\nsphere of action. A granite boulder on a mountain-side tends towards the\r\nearth below. It must abide in its resting-place for thousands of years\r\nbefore its support gives way. The shrub that grows at its base is\r\nfarther advanced; it accommodates itself to summer and winter. The fox\r\nwhich, overcoming the force of gravity, creeps to the summit where he\r\nhas scented his prey, is freer in his movements than either. The arm of\r\nman reaches further still; and scarcely anything of note happens in\r\nAfrica or Asia that does not leave an imprint upon his life. What an\r\nimmense portion of the life of other men is reflected in ourselves;\r\ntheir joys, their affections, their happiness and misery! And this too,\r\nwhen we survey only our immediate surroundings, and confine our\r\nattention to modern literature. How much more do we experience when we\r\ntravel through ancient Egypt with Herodotus, when we stroll through the\r\nstreets of Pompeii, when we carry ourselves back to the gloomy period of\r\nthe crusades or to the golden age of Italian art, now making the\r\nacquaintance of a physician of Molière, and now that of a Diderot or of\r\na D'Alembert. What a great part of the life of others, of their\r\ncharacter and their purpose, do we not absorb through poetry and music!\r\nAnd although they only gently touch the chords of our emotions, like the\r\nmemory of youth softly breathing upon the spirit of an aged man, we have\r\nnevertheless lived them over again in part. How great and comprehensive\r\ndoes self become in this conception; and how insignificant the person!\r\nEgoistical systems both of optimism and pessimism perish with their\r\nnarrow standard of the import of intellectual life. We feel that the\r\nreal pearls of life lie in the ever changing contents of consciousness,\r\nand that the person is merely an indifferent symbolical thread on which\r\nthey are strung.[78]\r\n\r\nWe are prepared, thus, to regard ourselves and every one of our ideas as\r\na product and a subject of universal evolution; and in this way we shall\r\nadvance sturdily and unimpeded along the paths which the future will\r\nthrow open to us.[79]\r\n\r\n  FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 69: Inaugural Address, delivered on assuming the Rectorate\r\n  of the University of Prague, October 18, 1883.\r\n\r\n  The idea presented in this essay is neither new nor remote. I have\r\n  touched upon it myself on several occasions (first in 1867), but\r\n  have never made it the subject of a formal disquisition. Doubtless,\r\n  others, too, have treated it; it lies, so to speak, in the air.\r\n  However, as many of my illustrations were well received, although\r\n  known only in an imperfect form from the lecture itself and the\r\n  newspapers, I have, contrary to my original intention, decided to\r\n  publish it. It is not my intention to trespass here upon the domain\r\n  of biology. My statements are to be taken merely as the expression\r\n  of the fact that no one can escape the influence of a great and\r\n  far-reaching idea.]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 70: At first sight an apparent contradiction arises from\r\n  the admission of both heredity and adaptation; and it is undoubtedly\r\n  true that a strong disposition to heredity precludes great\r\n  capability of adaptation. But imagine the organism to be a plastic\r\n  mass which retains the form transmitted to it by former influences\r\n  until new influences modify it; the _one_ property of _plasticity_\r\n  will then represent capability of adaptation as well as power of\r\n  heredity. Analogous to this is the case of a bar of magnetised steel\r\n  of high coercive force: the steel retains its magnetic properties\r\n  until a new force displaces them. Take also a body in motion: the\r\n  body retains the velocity acquired in (_inherited_ from) the\r\n  interval of time just preceding, except it be changed in the next\r\n  moment by an accelerating force. In the case of the body in motion\r\n  the _change_ of velocity (_Abänderung_) was looked upon as a matter\r\n  of course, while the discovery of the principle of _inertia_ (or\r\n  persistence) created surprise; in Darwin's case, on the contrary,\r\n  _heredity_ (or persistence) was taken for granted, while the\r\n  principle of _variation_ (_Abänderung_) appeared novel.\r\n\r\n  Fully adequate views are, of course, to be reached only by a study\r\n  of the original facts emphasised by Darwin, and not by these\r\n  analogies. The example referring to motion, if I am not mistaken, I\r\n  first heard, in conversation, from my friend J. Popper, Esq., of\r\n  Vienna.\r\n\r\n  Many inquirers look upon the stability of the species as something\r\n  settled, and oppose to it the Darwinian theory. But the stability of\r\n  the species is itself a \"theory.\" The essential modifications which\r\n  Darwin's views also are undergoing will be seen from the works of\r\n  Wallace [and Weismann], but more especially from a book of W. H.\r\n  Rolph, _Biologische Probleme_, Leipsic, 1882. Unfortunately, this\r\n  last talented investigator is no longer numbered among the living.]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 71: Written in 1883.]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 72: See Pfaundler, _Pogg.

But I would observe, that, judged by\r\n  the mischief which they have wrought, the metaphysical, of all\r\n  spooks, are the least fabulous. It is not to be denied that many\r\n  forms of thought were not originally acquired by the individual, but\r\n  were antecedently formed, or rather prepared for, in the development\r\n  of the species, in some such way as Spencer, Haeckel, Hering, and\r\n  others have supposed, and as I myself have hinted on various\r\n  occasions.]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 77: Compare, for example, _Schiller, Zerstreute\r\n  Betrachtungen über verschiedene ästhetische Gegenstände_.]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 78: We must not be deceived in imagining that the\r\n  happiness of other people is not a very considerable and essential\r\n  portion of our own.

The formal and\r\n  material limitation of the _ego_ is necessary and sufficient only\r\n  for the crudest practical objects, and cannot subsist in a broad\r\n  conception. Humanity in its entirety may be likened to a\r\n  polyp-plant. The material and organic bonds of individual union\r\n  have, indeed, been severed; they would only have impeded freedom of\r\n  movement and evolution.

E. von Baer, the subsequent opponent of Darwin and\r\n  Haeckel, has discussed in two beautiful addresses (_Das allgemeinste\r\n  Gesetz der Natur in aller Entwickelung_, and _Welche Auffassung der\r\n  lebenden Natur ist die richtige, und wie ist diese Auffassung auf\r\n  die Entomologie anzuwenden_?) the narrowness of the view which\r\n  regards an animal in its existing state as finished and complete,\r\n  instead of conceiving it as a phase in the series of evolutionary\r\n  forms and regarding the species itself as a phase of the development\r\n  of the animal world in general.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE PRINCIPLE OF COMPARISON IN PHYSICS.[80]\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago when Kirchhoff defined the object of mechanics as the\r\n\"description, in complete and very simple terms, of the motions\r\noccurring in nature,\" he produced by the statement a peculiar\r\nimpression. Fourteen years subsequently, Boltzmann, in the life-like\r\npicture which he drew of the great inquirer, could still speak of the\r\nuniversal astonishment at this novel method of treating mechanics, and\r\nwe meet with epistemological treatises to-day, which plainly show how\r\ndifficult is the acceptance of this point of view. A modest and small\r\nband of inquirers there were, however, to whom Kirchhoff's few words\r\nwere tidings of a welcome and powerful ally in the epistemological\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nNow, how does it happen that we yield our assent so reluctantly to the\r\nphilosophical opinion of an inquirer for whose scientific achievements\r\nwe have only words of praise? One reason probably is that few inquirers\r\ncan find time and leisure, amid the exacting employments demanded for\r\nthe acquisition of new knowledge, to inquire closely into that\r\ntremendous psychical process by which science is formed. Further, it is\r\ninevitable that much should be put into Kirchhoff's rigid words that\r\nthey were not originally intended to convey, and that much should be\r\nfound wanting in them that had always been regarded as an essential\r\nelement of scientific knowledge. What can mere description accomplish?\r\nWhat has become of explanation, of our insight into the causal connexion\r\nof things?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPermit me, for a moment, to contemplate not the results of science, but\r\nthe mode of its _growth_, in a frank and unbiassed manner. We know of\r\nonly _one_ source of _immediate revelation_ of scientific facts--_our\r\nsenses_. Restricted to this source alone, thrown wholly upon his own\r\nresources, obliged to start always anew, what could the isolated\r\nindividual accomplish? Of a stock of knowledge so acquired the science\r\nof a distant negro hamlet in darkest Africa could hardly give us a\r\nsufficiently humiliating conception. For there that veritable miracle of\r\nthought-transference has already begun its work, compared with which the\r\nmiracles of the spiritualists are rank monstrosities--_communication by\r\nlanguage_. Reflect, too, that by means of the magical characters which\r\nour libraries contain we can raise the spirits of the \"the sovereign\r\ndead of old\" from Faraday to Galileo and Archimedes, through ages of\r\ntime--spirits who do not dismiss us with ambiguous and derisive\r\noracles, but tell us the best they know; then shall we feel what a\r\nstupendous and indispensable factor in the formation of science\r\n_communication_ is. Not the dim, half-conscious _surmises_ of the acute\r\nobserver of nature or critic of humanity belong to science, but only\r\nthat which they possess clearly enough to _communicate_ to others.\r\n\r\nBut how, now, do we go about this communication of a newly acquired\r\nexperience, of a newly observed fact? As the different calls and\r\nbattle-cries of gregarious animals are unconsciously formed signs for a\r\ncommon observation or action, irrespective of the causes which produce\r\nsuch action--a fact that already involves the germ of the concept; so\r\nalso the words of human language, which is only more highly specialised,\r\nare names or signs for universally known facts, which all can observe or\r\nhave observed. If the mental representation, accordingly, follows the\r\nnew fact at once and _passively_, then that new fact must, of itself,\r\nimmediately be constituted and represented in thought by facts already\r\nuniversally known and commonly observed. Memory is always ready to put\r\nforward for _comparison_ known facts which resemble the new event, or\r\nagree with it in certain features, and so renders possible that\r\nelementary internal judgment which the mature and definitively\r\nformulated judgment soon follows.\r\n\r\nComparison, as the fundamental condition of communication, is the most\r\npowerful inner vital element of science. The zoölogist sees in the\r\nbones of the wing-membranes of bats, fingers; he compares the bones of\r\nthe cranium with the vertebræ, the embryos of different organisms with\r\none another, and the different stages of development of the same\r\norganism with one another. The geographer sees in Lake Garda a fjord, in\r\nthe Sea of Aral a lake in process of drying up. The philologist compares\r\ndifferent languages with one another, and the formations of the same\r\nlanguage as well. If it is not customary to speak of comparative physics\r\nin the same sense that we speak of comparative anatomy, the reason is\r\nthat in a science of such great experimental activity the attention is\r\nturned away too much from the _contemplative_ element. But like all\r\nother sciences, physics lives and grows by comparison.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the result of the comparison finds expression in the\r\ncommunication, varies of course very much. When we say that the colors\r\nof the spectrum are red, yellow, green, blue, and violet, the\r\ndesignations employed may possibly have been derived from the technology\r\nof tattooing, or they may subsequently have acquired the significance of\r\nstanding for the colors of the rose, the lemon, the leaf, the\r\ncorn-flower, and the violet. From the frequent repetition of such\r\ncomparisons, however, made under the most manifold circumstances, the\r\ninconstant features, as compared with the permanent congruent features,\r\nget so obliterated that the latter acquire a fixed significance\r\nindependent of every object and connexion, or take on as we say an\r\n_abstract_ or _conceptual_ import. No one thinks at the word \"red\" of\r\nany other agreement with the rose than that of color, or at the word\r\n\"straight\" of any other property of a stretched cord than the sameness\r\nof direction. Just so, too, numbers, originally the names of the fingers\r\nof the hands and feet, from being used as arrangement-signs for all\r\nkinds of objects, were lifted to the plane of abstract concepts. A\r\nverbal report (communication) of a fact that uses only these purely\r\nabstract implements, we call a _direct description_.\r\n\r\nThe direct description of a fact of any great extent is an irksome task,\r\neven where the requisite notions are already completely developed. What\r\na simplification it involves if we can say, the fact _A_ now considered\r\ncomports itself, not in _one_, but in _many_ or in _all_ its features,\r\nlike an old and well-known fact _B_. The moon comports itself as a heavy\r\nbody does with respect to the earth; light like a wave-motion or an\r\nelectric vibration; a magnet, as if it were laden with gravitating\r\nfluids, and so on. We call such a description, in which we appeal, as it\r\nwere, to a description already and elsewhere formulated, or perhaps\r\nstill to be precisely formulated, an _indirect description_. We are at\r\nliberty to supplement this description, gradually, by direct\r\ndescription, to correct it, or to replace it altogether. We see, thus,\r\nwithout difficulty, that what is called a _theory_ or a _theoretical\r\nidea_, falls under the category of what is here termed indirect\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat, now, is a theoretical idea? Whence do we get it? What does it\r\naccomplish for us? Why does it occupy a higher place in our judgment\r\nthan the mere holding fast to a fact or an observation? Here, too,\r\nmemory and comparison alone are in play. But instead of _a single_\r\nfeature of resemblance culled from memory, in this case _a great system_\r\nof resemblances confronts us, a well-known physiognomy, by means of\r\nwhich the new fact is immediately transformed into an old acquaintance.\r\nBesides, it is in the power of the idea to offer us more than we\r\nactually see in the new fact, at the first moment; it can extend the\r\nfact, and enrich it with features which we are first induced to _seek_\r\nfrom such suggestions, and which are often actually found. It is this\r\n_rapidity_ in extending knowledge that gives to theory a preference over\r\nsimple observation. But that preference is wholly _quantitative_.\r\nQualitatively, and in real essential points, theory differs from\r\nobservation neither in the mode of its origin nor in its last results.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of a theory, however, always involves a danger. For a\r\ntheory puts in the place of a fact _A_ in thought, always a _different_,\r\nbut simpler and more familiar fact _B_, which in _some_ relations can\r\nmentally represent _A_, but for the very reason that it is different, in\r\nother relations cannot represent it. If now, as may readily happen,\r\nsufficient care is not exercised, the most fruitful theory may, in\r\nspecial circumstances, become a downright obstacle to inquiry. Thus, the\r\nemission-theory of light, in accustoming the physicist to think of the\r\nprojectile path of the \"light-particles\" as an undifferentiated\r\nstraight-line, demonstrably impeded the discovery of the periodicity of\r\nlight. By putting in the place of light the more familiar phenomena of\r\nsound, Huygens renders light in many of its features a familiar event,\r\nbut with respect to polarisation, which lacks the longitudinal waves\r\nwith which alone he was acquainted, it had for him a doubly strange\r\naspect. He is unable thus to grasp in abstract thought the fact of\r\npolarisation, which is before his eyes, whilst Newton, merely by\r\nadapting to the observation his thoughts, and putting this question,\r\n\"_Annon radiorum luminis diversa sunt latera?_\" abstractly grasped\r\npolarisation, that is, directly described it, a century before Malus. On\r\nthe other hand, if the agreement of the fact with the idea theoretically\r\nrepresenting it, extends further than its inventor originally\r\nanticipated, then we may be led by it to unexpected discoveries, of\r\nwhich conical refraction, circular polarisation by total reflexion,\r\nHertz's waves offer ready examples, in contrast to the illustrations\r\ngiven above.\r\n\r\nOur insight into the conditions indicated will be improved, perhaps, by\r\ncontemplating the development of some theory or other more in detail.\r\nLet us consider a magnetised bar of steel by the side of a second\r\nunmagnetised bar, in all other respects the same. The second bar gives\r\nno indication of the presence of iron-filings; the first attracts them.\r\nAlso, when the iron-filings are absent, we must think of the magnetised\r\nbar as in a different condition from that of the unmagnetised. For, that\r\nthe mere presence of the iron-filings does not induce the phenomenon of\r\nattraction is proved by the second unmagnetised bar. The ingenuous man,\r\nwho finds in his will, as his most familiar source of power, the best\r\nfacilities for comparison, conceives a species of _spirit_ in the\r\nmagnet. The behavior of a warm body or of an _electrified_ body suggests\r\nsimilar ideas. This is the point of view of the oldest theory,\r\n_fetishism_, which the inquirers of the early Middle Ages had not yet\r\novercome, and which in its last vestiges, in the conception of forces,\r\nstill flourishes in modern physics. We see, thus, the _dramatic_ element\r\nneed no more be absent in a scientific description, than in a thrilling\r\nnovel.\r\n\r\nIf, on subsequent examination, it be observed that a cold body, in\r\ncontact with a hot body, warms itself, so to speak, _at the expense_ of\r\nthe hot body; further, that when the substances are the same, the cold\r\nbody, which, let us say, has twice the mass of the other, gains only\r\nhalf the number of degrees of temperature that the other loses, a wholly\r\nnew impression arises. The demoniac character of the event vanishes, for\r\nthe supposed spirit acts not by caprice, but according to fixed laws. In\r\nits place, however, _instinctively_ the notion of a _substance_ is\r\nsubstituted, part of which flows over from the one body to the other,\r\nbut the total amount of which, representable by the sum of the products\r\nof the masses into the respective changes of temperature, remains\r\nconstant. Black was the first to be _powerfully_ struck with this\r\nresemblance of thermal processes to the motion of a substance, and under\r\nits guidance discovered the specific heat, the heat of fusion, and the\r\nheat of vaporisation of bodies. Gaining strength and fixity, however,\r\nfrom these successes, this notion of substance subsequently stood in the\r\nway of scientific advancement. It blinded the eyes of the successors of\r\nBlack, and prevented them from seeing the manifest fact, which every\r\nsavage knows, that heat is _produced_ by friction. Fruitful as that\r\nnotion was for Black, helpful as it still is to the learner to-day in\r\nBlack's special field, permanent and universal validity as a _theory_ it\r\ncould never maintain. But what is essential, conceptually, in it, viz.,\r\nthe constancy of the product-sum above mentioned, retains its value and\r\nmay be regarded as a _direct description_ of Black's facts.\r\n\r\nIt stands to reason that those theories which push themselves forward\r\nunsought, instinctively, and wholly of their own accord, should have the\r\ngreatest power, should carry our thoughts most with them, and exhibit\r\nthe staunchest powers of self-preservation. On the other hand, it may\r\nalso be observed that when critically scrutinised such theories are\r\nextremely apt to lose their cogency. We are constantly busied with\r\n\"substance,\" its modes of action have stamped themselves indelibly upon\r\nour thoughts, our vividest and clearest reminiscences are associated\r\nwith it. It should cause us no surprise, therefore, that Robert Mayer\r\nand Joule, who gave the final blow to Black's substantial conception of\r\nheat, should have re-introduced the same notion of substance in a more\r\nabstract and modified form, only applying to a much more extensive\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nHere, too, the psychological circumstances which impart to the new\r\nconception its power, lie clearly before us. By the unusual redness of\r\nthe venous blood in tropical climates Mayer's attention is directed to\r\nthe lessened expenditure of internal heat and to the proportionately\r\nlessened _consumption of material_ by the human body in those climates.\r\nBut as every effort of the human organism, including its mechanical\r\nwork, is connected with the consumption of material, and as work by\r\nfriction can engender heat, therefore heat and work appear in kind\r\nequivalent, and between them a proportional relation must subsist. Not\r\n_every_ quantity, but the appropriately calculated _sum_ of the two, as\r\nconnected with a proportionate consumption of material, appears\r\n_substantial_.\r\n\r\nBy exactly similar considerations, relative to the economy of the\r\ngalvanic element, Joule arrived at his view; he found experimentally\r\nthat the sum of the heat evolved in the circuit, of the heat consumed in\r\nthe combustion of the gas developed, of the electro-magnetic work of\r\nthe current, properly calculated,--in short, the sum of all the effects\r\nof the battery,--is connected with a proportionate consumption of zinc.\r\nAccordingly, this sum itself has a substantial character.\r\n\r\nMayer was so absorbed with the view attained, that the indestructibility\r\nof _force_, in our phraseology _work_, appeared to him _a priori_\r\nevident. \"The creation or annihilation of a force,\" he says, \"lies\r\nwithout the province of human thought and power.\" Joule expressed\r\nhimself to a similar effect: \"It is manifestly absurd to suppose that\r\nthe powers with which God has endowed matter can be destroyed.\" Strange\r\nto say, on the basis of such utterances, not Joule, but Mayer, was\r\nstamped as a metaphysician. We may be sure, however, that both men were\r\nmerely giving expression, and that half-unconsciously, to a powerful\r\n_formal_ need of the new simple view, and that both would have been\r\nextremely surprised if it had been proposed to them that their principle\r\nshould be submitted to a philosophical congress or ecclesiastical synod\r\nfor a decision upon its validity. But with all agreements, the attitude\r\nof these two men, in other respects, was totally different. Whilst Mayer\r\nrepresented this _formal_ need with all the stupendous instinctive force\r\nof genius, we might say almost with the ardor of fanaticism, yet was\r\nwithal not wanting in the conceptive ability to compute, prior to all\r\nother inquirers, the mechanical equivalent of heat from old physical\r\nconstants long known and at the disposal of all, and so to set up for\r\nthe new doctrine a programme embracing all physics and physiology;\r\nJoule, on the other hand, applied himself to the exact verification of\r\nthe doctrine by beautifully conceived and masterfully executed\r\nexperiments, extending over all departments of physics. Soon Helmholtz\r\ntoo attacked the problem, in a totally independent and characteristic\r\nmanner. After the professional virtuosity with which this physicist\r\ngrasped and disposed of all the points unsettled by Mayer's programme\r\nand more besides, what especially strikes us is the consummate critical\r\nlucidity of this young man of twenty-six years. In his exposition is\r\nwanting that vehemence and impetuosity which marked Mayer's. The\r\nprinciple of the conservation of energy is no self-evident or _a priori_\r\nproposition for him. What follows, on the assumption that that\r\nproposition obtains? In this hypothetical form, he subjugates his\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nI must confess, I have always marvelled at the æsthetic and ethical\r\ntaste of many of our contemporaries who have managed to fabricate out of\r\nthis relation of things, odious national and personal questions, instead\r\nof praising the good fortune that made _several_ such men work together\r\nand of rejoicing at the instructive diversity and idiosyncrasies of\r\ngreat minds fraught with such rich consequences for us.\r\n\r\nWe know that still another theoretical conception played a part in the\r\ndevelopment of the principle of energy, which Mayer held aloof from,\r\nnamely, the conception that heat, as also the other physical processes,\r\nare due to motion. But once the principle of energy has been reached,\r\nthese auxiliary and transitional theories discharge no essential\r\nfunction, and we may regard the principle, like that which Black gave,\r\nas a contribution to the _direct description_ of a widely extended\r\ndomain of facts.\r\n\r\nIt would appear from such considerations not only advisable, but even\r\nnecessary, with all due recognition of the helpfulness of theoretic\r\nideas in research, yet gradually, as the new facts grow familiar, to\r\nsubstitute for indirect description _direct_ description, which contains\r\nnothing that is unessential and restricts itself absolutely to the\r\nabstract apprehension of facts. We might almost say, that the\r\ndescriptive sciences, so called with a tincture of condescension, have,\r\nin respect of scientific character, outstripped the physical expositions\r\nlately in vogue. Of course, a virtue has been made of necessity here.\r\n\r\nWe must admit, that it is not in our power to describe directly every\r\nfact, on the moment. Indeed, we should succumb in utter despair if the\r\nwhole wealth of facts which we come step by step to know, were presented\r\nto us all at once. Happily, only detached and unusual features first\r\nstrike us, and such we bring nearer to ourselves by _comparison_ with\r\nevery-day events. Here the notions of the common speech are first\r\ndeveloped. The comparisons then grow more manifold and numerous, the\r\nfields of facts compared more extensive, the concepts that make direct\r\ndescription possible, proportionately more general and more abstract.\r\n\r\nFirst we become familiar with the motion of freely falling bodies. The\r\nconcepts of force, mass, and work are then carried over, with\r\nappropriate modifications, to the phenomena of electricity and\r\nmagnetism. A stream of water is said to have suggested to Fourier the\r\nfirst distinct picture of currents of heat. A special case of vibrations\r\nof strings investigated by Taylor, cleared up for him a special case of\r\nthe conduction of heat. Much in the same way that Daniel Bernoulli and\r\nEuler constructed the most diverse forms of vibrations of strings from\r\nTaylor's cases, so Fourier constructs out of simple cases of conduction\r\nthe most multifarious motions of heat; and that method has extended\r\nitself over the whole of physics. Ohm forms his conception of the\r\nelectric current in imitation of Fourier's. The latter, also, adopts\r\nFick's theory of diffusion. In an analogous manner a conception of the\r\nmagnetic current is developed. All sorts of stationary currents are thus\r\nmade to exhibit common features, and even the condition of complete\r\nequilibrium in an extended medium shares these features with the\r\ndynamical condition of equilibrium of a stationary current. Things as\r\nremote as the magnetic lines of force of an electric current and the\r\nstream-lines of a frictionless liquid vortex enter in this way into a\r\npeculiar relationship of similarity. The concept of potential,\r\noriginally enunciated for a restricted province, acquires a\r\nwide-reaching applicability. Things as dissimilar as pressure,\r\ntemperature, and electromotive force, now show points of agreement in\r\nrelation to ideas derived by definite methods from that concept: viz.,\r\nfall of pressure, fall of temperature, fall of potential, as also with\r\nthe further notions of liquid, thermal, and electric strength of\r\ncurrent. That relationship between systems of ideas in which the\r\ndissimilarity of every two homologous concepts as well as the agreement\r\nin logical relations of every two homologous pairs of concepts, is\r\nclearly brought to light, is called an _analogy_. It is an effective\r\nmeans of mastering heterogeneous fields of facts in unitary\r\ncomprehension. The path is plainly shown in which _a universal physical\r\nphenomenology_ embracing all domains, will be developed.\r\n\r\nIn the process described we attain for the first time to what is\r\nindispensable in the direct description of broad fields of fact--the\r\nwide-reaching _abstract concept_. And now I must put a question smacking\r\nof the school-master, but unavoidable: What is a concept? Is it a hazy\r\nrepresentation, admitting withal of mental visualisation? No. Mental\r\nvisualisation accompanies it only in the simplest cases, and then merely\r\nas an adjunct. Think, for example, of the \"coefficient of\r\nself-induction,\" and seek for its visualised mental image. Or is,\r\nperhaps, the concept a mere word? The adoption of this forlorn idea,\r\nwhich has been actually proposed of late by a reputed mathematician\r\nwould only throw us back a thousand years into the deepest\r\nscholasticism. We must, therefore, reject it.\r\n\r\nThe solution is not far to seek. We must not think that sensation, or\r\nrepresentation, is a purely passive process. The lowest organisms\r\nrespond to it with a simple reflex motion, by engulfing the prey which\r\napproaches them. In higher organisms the centripetal stimulus encounters\r\nin the nervous system obstacles and aids which modify the centrifugal\r\nprocess. In still higher organisms, where prey is pursued and examined,\r\nthe process in question may go through extensive paths of circular\r\nmotions before it comes to relative rest. Our own life, too, is enacted\r\nin such processes; all that we call science may be regarded as parts, or\r\nmiddle terms, of such activities.\r\n\r\nIt will not surprise us now if I say: the definition of a concept, and,\r\nwhen it is very familiar, even its name, is an _impulse_ to some\r\naccurately determined, often complicated, critical, comparative, or\r\nconstructive _activity_, the usually sense-perceptive result of which is\r\na term or member of the concept's scope. It matters not whether the\r\nconcept draws the attention only to one certain sense (as sight) or to a\r\nphase of a sense (as color, form), or is the starting-point of a\r\ncomplicated action; nor whether the activity in question (chemical,\r\nanatomical, and mathematical operations) is muscular or technical, or\r\nperformed wholly in the imagination, or only intimated. The concept is\r\nto the physicist what a musical note is to a piano-player. A trained\r\nphysicist or mathematician reads a memoir like a musician reads a score.\r\nBut just as the piano-player must first learn to move his fingers singly\r\nand collectively, before he can follow his notes without effort, so the\r\nphysicist or mathematician must go through a long apprenticeship before\r\nhe gains control, so to speak, of the manifold delicate innervations of\r\nhis muscles and imagination. Think of how frequently the beginner in\r\nphysics or mathematics performs more, or less, than is required, or of\r\nhow frequently he conceives things differently from what they are! But\r\nif, after having had sufficient discipline, he lights upon the phrase\r\n\"coefficient of self-induction,\" he knows immediately what that term\r\nrequires of him. Long and thoroughly practised _actions_, which have\r\ntheir origin in the necessity of comparing and representing facts by\r\nother facts, are thus the very kernel of concepts. In fact, positive and\r\nphilosophical philology both claim to have established that all roots\r\nrepresent concepts and stood originally for muscular activities alone.\r\nThe slow assent of physicists to Kirchhoff's dictum now becomes\r\nintelligible. They best could feel the vast amount of individual labor,\r\ntheory, and skill required before the ideal of direct description could\r\nbe realised.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuppose, now, the ideal of a given province of facts is reached. Does\r\ndescription accomplish all that the inquirer can ask? In my opinion, it\r\ndoes. Description is a building up of facts in thought, and this\r\nbuilding up is, in the experimental sciences, often the condition of\r\nactual execution. For the physicist, to take a special case, the\r\nmetrical units are the building-stones, the concepts the directions for\r\nbuilding, and the facts the result of the building. Our mental imagery\r\nis almost a complete substitute for the fact, and by means of it we can\r\nascertain all the fact's properties. We do not know that worst which we\r\nourselves have made.\r\n\r\nPeople require of science that it should _prophesy_, and Hertz uses that\r\nexpression in his posthumous _Mechanics_. But, natural as it is, the\r\nexpression is too narrow. The geologist and the palæontologist, at times\r\nthe astronomer, and always the historian and the philologist, prophesy,\r\nso to speak, _backwards_. The descriptive sciences, like geometry and\r\nmathematics, prophesy neither forward or backwards, but seek from given\r\nconditions the conditioned. Let us say rather: _Science completes in\r\nthought facts that are only partly given_. This is rendered possible by\r\ndescription, for description presupposes the interdependence of the\r\ndescriptive elements: otherwise nothing would be described.\r\n\r\nIt is said, description leaves the sense of causality unsatisfied. In\r\nfact, many imagine they understand motions better when they picture to\r\nthemselves the pulling forces; and yet the _accelerations_, the facts,\r\naccomplish more, without superfluous additions. I hope that the science\r\nof the future will discard the idea of cause and effect, as being\r\nformally obscure; and in my feeling that these ideas contain a strong\r\ntincture of fetishism, I am certainly not alone. The more proper course\r\nis, _to regard the abstract determinative elements of a fact as\r\ninterdependent_, in a purely logical way, as the mathematician or\r\ngeometer does. True, by comparison with the will, forces are brought\r\nnearer to our feeling; but it may be that ultimately the will itself\r\nwill be made clearer by comparison with the accelerations of masses.\r\n\r\nIf we are asked, candidly, when is a fact _clear_ to us, we must say\r\n\"when we can reproduce it by very _simple_ and very familiar\r\nintellectual operations, such as the construction of accelerations, or\r\nthe geometrical summation of accelerations, and so forth.\" The\r\nrequirement of _simplicity_ is of course to the expert a different\r\nmatter from what it is to the novice. For the first, description by a\r\nsystem of differential equations is sufficient; for the second, a\r\ngradual construction out of elementary laws is required. The first\r\ndiscerns at once the connexion of the two expositions. Of course, it is\r\nnot disputed that the _artistic_ value of materially equivalent\r\ndescriptions may not be different.\r\n\r\nMost difficult is it to persuade strangers that the grand universal laws\r\nof physics, such as apply indiscriminately to material, electrical,\r\nmagnetic, and other systems, are not essentially different from\r\ndescriptions. As compared with many sciences, physics occupies in this\r\nrespect a position of vantage that is easily explained. Take, for\r\nexample, anatomy. As the anatomist in his quest for agreements and\r\ndifferences in animals ascends to ever higher and higher\r\n_classifications_, the individual facts that represent the ultimate\r\nterms of the system, are still so different that they must be _singly_\r\nnoted. Think, for example, of the common marks of the Vertebrates, of\r\nthe class-characters of Mammals and Birds on the one hand and of Fishes\r\non the other, of the double circulation of the blood on the one hand and\r\nof the single on the other. In the end, always _isolated_ facts remain,\r\nwhich show only a _slight_ likeness to one another.\r\n\r\nA science still more closely allied to physics, chemistry, is often in\r\nthe same strait. The abrupt change of the qualitative properties, in all\r\nlikelihood conditioned by the slight stability of the intermediate\r\nstates, the remote resemblance of the co-ordinated facts of chemistry\r\nrender the treatment of its data difficult. Pairs of bodies of different\r\nqualitative properties unite in different mass-ratios; but no connexion\r\nbetween the first and the last is to be noted, at first.\r\n\r\nPhysics, on the other hand, reveals to us wide domains of _qualitatively\r\nhomogeneous_ facts, differing from one another only in the number of\r\nequal parts into which their characteristic marks are divisible, that\r\nis, differing only _quantitatively_. Even where we have to deal with\r\nqualities (colors and sounds), quantitative characters of those\r\nqualities are at our disposal. Here the classification is so simple a\r\ntask that it rarely impresses us as such, whilst in infinitely fine\r\ngradations, in a _continuum of facts_, our number-system is ready\r\nbeforehand to follow as far as we wish. The co-ordinated facts are here\r\nextremely similar and very closely affined, as are also their\r\ndescriptions which consist in the determination of the numerical\r\nmeasures of one given set of characters from those of a different set by\r\nmeans of familiar mathematical operations--methods of derivation. Thus,\r\nthe common characteristics of all descriptions can be found here; and\r\nwith them a succinct, comprehensive description, or a rule for the\r\nconstruction of all single descriptions, is assigned,--and this we call\r\n_law_. Well-known examples are the formulæ for freely falling bodies,\r\nfor projectiles, for central motion, and so forth. If physics apparently\r\naccomplishes more by its methods than other sciences, we must remember\r\nthat in a sense it has presented to it much simpler problems.\r\n\r\nThe remaining sciences, whose facts also present a physical side, need\r\nnot be envious of physics for this superiority; for all its acquisitions\r\nultimately redound to their benefit as well. But also in other ways this\r\nmutual help shall and must change. Chemistry has advanced very far in\r\nmaking the methods of physics her own. Apart from older attempts, the\r\nperiodical series of Lothar Meyer and Mendelejeff are a brilliant and\r\nadequate means of producing an easily surveyed system of facts, which by\r\ngradually becoming complete, will take the place almost of a continuum\r\nof facts. Further, by the study of solutions, of dissociation, in fact\r\ngenerally of phenomena which present a continuum of cases, the methods\r\nof thermodynamics have found entrance into chemistry. Similarly we may\r\nhope that, at some future day, a mathematician, letting the\r\nfact-continuum of embryology play before his mind, which the\r\npalæontologists of the future will supposedly have enriched with more\r\nintermediate and derivative forms between Saurian and Bird than the\r\nisolated Pterodactyl, Archæopteryx, Ichthyornis, and so forth, which we\r\nnow have--that such a mathematician shall transform, by the variation of\r\na few parameters, as in a dissolving view, one form into another, just\r\nas we transform one conic section into another.\r\n\r\nReverting now to Kirchhoff's words, we can come to some agreement\r\nregarding their import. Nothing can be built without building-stones,\r\nmortar, scaffolding, and a builder's skill. Yet assuredly the wish is\r\nwell founded, that will show to posterity the complete structure in its\r\nfinished form, bereft of unsightly scaffolding. It is the pure logical\r\nand æsthetic sense of the mathematician that speaks out of Kirchhoff's\r\nwords. Modern expositions of physics aspire after his ideal; that, too,\r\nis intelligible. But it would be a poor didactic shift, for one whose\r\nbusiness it was to train architects, to say: \"Here is a splendid\r\nedifice; if thou wouldst really build, go thou and do likewise\".\r\n\r\nThe barriers between the special sciences, which make division of work\r\nand concentration possible, but which appear to us after all as cold and\r\nconventional restrictions, will gradually disappear. Bridge upon bridge\r\nis thrown over the gaps. Contents and methods, even of the remotest\r\nbranches, are compared. When the Congress of Natural Scientists shall\r\nmeet a hundred years hence, we may expect that they will represent a\r\nunity in a higher sense than is possible to-day, not in sentiment and\r\naim alone, but in method also. In the meantime, this great change will\r\nbe helped by our keeping constantly before our minds the fact of the\r\nintrinsic relationship of all research, which Kirchhoff characterised\r\nwith such classical simplicity.\r\n\r\n  FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 80: An address delivered before the General Session of the\r\n  German Association of Naturalists and Physicians, at Vienna, Sept.\r\n  24, 1894.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PART PLAYED BY ACCIDENT IN INVENTION AND DISCOVERY.[81]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is characteristic of the naïve and sanguine beginnings of thought in\r\nyouthful men and nations, that all problems are held to be soluble and\r\nfundamentally intelligible on the first appearance of success. The sage\r\nof Miletus, on seeing plants take their rise from moisture, believed he\r\nhad comprehended the whole of nature, and he of Samos, on discovering\r\nthat definite numbers corresponded to the lengths of harmonic strings,\r\nimagined he could exhaust the nature of the world by means of numbers.\r\nPhilosophy and science in such periods are blended. Wider experience,\r\nhowever, speedily discloses the error of such a course, gives rise to\r\ncriticism, and leads to the division and ramification of the sciences.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the necessity of a broad and general view of the world\r\nremains; and to meet this need philosophy parts company with special\r\ninquiry. It is true, the two are often found united in gigantic\r\npersonalities. But as a rule their ways diverge more and more widely\r\nfrom each other. And if the estrangement of philosophy from science can\r\nreach a point where data unworthy of the nursery are not deemed too\r\nscanty as foundations of the world, on the other hand the thorough-paced\r\nspecialist may go to the extreme of rejecting point-blank the\r\npossibility of a broader view, or at least of deeming it superfluous,\r\nforgetful of Voltaire's apophthegm, nowhere more applicable than here,\r\n_Le superflu--chose très nécessaire_.\r\n\r\nIt is true, the history of philosophy, owing to the insufficiency of its\r\nconstructive data, is and must be largely a history of error. But it\r\nwould be the height of ingratitude on our part to forget that the seeds\r\nof thoughts which still fructify the soil of special research, such as\r\nthe theory of irrationals, the conceptions of conservation, the doctrine\r\nof evolution, the idea of specific energies, and so forth, may be traced\r\nback in distant ages to philosophical sources. Furthermore, to have\r\ndeferred or abandoned the attempt at a broad philosophical view of the\r\nworld from a full knowledge of the insufficiency of our materials, is\r\nquite a different thing from never having undertaken it at all. The\r\nrevenge of its neglect, moreover, is constantly visited upon the\r\nspecialist by his committal of the very errors which philosophy long ago\r\nexposed. As a fact, in physics and physiology, particularly during the\r\nfirst half of this century, are to be met intellectual productions\r\nwhich for naïve simplicity are not a jot inferior to those of the Ionian\r\nschool, or to the Platonic ideas, or to that much reviled ontological\r\nproof.\r\n\r\nLatterly, there has been evidence of a gradual change in the situation.\r\nRecent philosophy has set itself more modest and more attainable ends;\r\nit is no longer inimical to special inquiry; in fact, it is zealously\r\ntaking part in that inquiry. On the other hand, the special sciences,\r\nmathematics and physics, no less than philology, have become eminently\r\nphilosophical. The material presented is no longer accepted\r\nuncritically. The glance of the inquirer is bent upon neighboring\r\nfields, whence that material has been derived. The different special\r\ndepartments are striving for closer union, and gradually the conviction\r\nis gaining ground that philosophy can consist only of mutual,\r\ncomplemental criticism, interpenetration, and union of the special\r\nsciences into a consolidated whole. As the blood in nourishing the body\r\nseparates into countless capillaries, only to be collected again and to\r\nmeet in the heart, so in the science of the future all the rills of\r\nknowledge will gather more and more into a common and undivided stream.\r\n\r\nIt is this view--not an unfamiliar one to the present generation--that I\r\npurpose to advocate. Entertain no hope, or rather fear, that I shall\r\nconstruct systems for you. I shall remain a natural inquirer. Nor expect\r\nthat it is my intention to skirt all the fields of natural inquiry. I\r\ncan attempt to be your guide only in that branch which is familiar to\r\nme, and even there I can assist in the furtherment of only a small\r\nportion of the allotted task. If I shall succeed in rendering plain to\r\nyou the relations of physics, psychology, and the theory of knowledge,\r\nso that you may draw from each profit and light, redounding to the\r\nadvantage of each, I shall regard my work as not having been in vain.\r\nTherefore, to illustrate by an example how, consonantly with my powers\r\nand views, I conceive such inquiries should be conducted, I shall treat\r\nto-day, in the form of a brief sketch, of the following special and\r\nlimited subject--of _the part which accidental circumstances play in the\r\ndevelopment of inventions and discoveries_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen we Germans say of a man that he was not the inventor of\r\ngunpowder,[82] we impliedly cast a grave suspicion on his abilities. But\r\nthe expression is not a felicitous one, as there is probably no\r\ninvention in which deliberate thought had a smaller, and pure luck a\r\nlarger, share than in this. It is well to ask, Are we justified in\r\nplacing a low estimate on the achievement of an inventor because\r\naccident has assisted him in his work? Huygens, whose discoveries and\r\ninventions are justly sufficient to entitle him to an opinion in such\r\nmatters, lays great emphasis on this factor. He asserts that a man\r\ncapable of inventing the telescope without the concurrence of accident\r\nmust have been gifted with superhuman genius.[83]\r\n\r\nA man living in the midst of civilisation finds himself surrounded by a\r\nhost of marvellous inventions, considering none other than the means of\r\nsatisfying the needs of daily life. Picture such a man transported to\r\nthe epoch preceding the invention of these ingenious appliances, and\r\nimagine him undertaking in a serious manner to comprehend their origin.\r\nAt first the intellectual power of the men capable of producing such\r\nmarvels will strike him as incredible, or, if we adopt the ancient view,\r\nas divine. But his astonishment is considerably allayed by the\r\ndisenchanting yet elucidative revelations of the history of primitive\r\nculture, which to a large extent prove that these inventions took their\r\nrise very slowly and by imperceptible degrees.\r\n\r\nA small hole in the ground with fire kindled in it constituted the\r\nprimitive stove. The flesh of the quarry, wrapped with water in its\r\nskin, was boiled by contact with heated stones. Cooking by stones was\r\nalso done in wooden vessels. Hollow gourds were protected from the fire\r\nby coats of clay. Thus, from the burned clay accidentally originated the\r\nenveloping pot, which rendered the gourd superfluous, although for a\r\nlong time thereafter the clay was still spread over the gourd, or\r\npressed into woven wicker-work before the potter's art assumed its final\r\nindependence. Even then the wicker-work ornament was retained, as a sort\r\nof attest of its origin.\r\n\r\nWe see, thus, it is by accidental circumstances, or by such as lie\r\nwithout our purpose, foresight, and power, that man is gradually led to\r\nthe acquaintance of improved means of satisfying his wants. Let the\r\nreader picture to himself the genius of a man who could have foreseen\r\nwithout the help of accident that clay handled in the ordinary manner\r\nwould produce a useful cooking utensil! The majority of the inventions\r\nmade in the early stages of civilisation, including language, writing,\r\nmoney, and the rest, could not have been the product of deliberate\r\nmethodical reflexion for the simple reason that no idea of their value\r\nand significance could have been had except from practical use. The\r\ninvention of the bridge may have been suggested by the trunk of a tree\r\nwhich had fallen athwart a mountain-torrent; that of the tool by the use\r\nof a stone accidentally taken into the hand to crack nuts. The use of\r\nfire probably started in and was disseminated from regions where\r\nvolcanic eruptions, hot springs, and burning jets of natural gas\r\nafforded opportunity for quietly observing and turning to practical\r\naccount the properties of fire. Only after that had been done could the\r\nsignificance of the fire-drill be appreciated, an instrument which was\r\nprobably discovered from boring a hole through a piece of wood. The\r\nsuggestion of a distinguished inquirer that the invention of the\r\nfire-drill originated on the occasion of a religious ceremony is both\r\nfantastic and incredible. And as to the use of fire, we should no more\r\nattempt to derive that from the invention of the fire-drill than we\r\nshould from the invention of sulphur matches. Unquestionably the\r\nopposite course was the real one.[84]\r\n\r\nSimilar phenomena, though still largely veiled in obscurity, mark the\r\ninitial transition of nations from a hunting to a nomadic life and to\r\nagriculture.[85] We shall not multiply examples, but content ourselves\r\nwith the remark that the same phenomena recur in historical times, in\r\nthe ages of great technical inventions, and, further, that regarding\r\nthem the most whimsical notions have been circulated--notions which\r\nascribe to accident an unduly exaggerated part, and one which in a\r\npsychological respect is absolutely impossible. The observation of steam\r\nescaping from a tea-kettle and of the clattering of the lid is supposed\r\nto have led to the invention of the steam-engine. Just think of the gap\r\nbetween this spectacle and the conception of the performance of great\r\nmechanical work by steam, for a man totally ignorant of the\r\nsteam-engine! Let us suppose, however, that an engineer, versed in the\r\npractical construction of pumps, should accidentally dip into water an\r\ninverted bottle that had been filled with steam for drying and still\r\nretained its steam. He would see the water rush violently into the\r\nbottle, and the idea would very naturally suggest itself of founding on\r\nthis experience a convenient and useful atmospheric steam-pump, which by\r\nimperceptible degrees, both psychologically possible and immediate,\r\nwould then undergo a natural and gradual transformation into Watt's\r\nsteam-engine.\r\n\r\nBut granting that the most important inventions are brought to man's\r\nnotice accidentally and in ways that are beyond his foresight, yet it\r\ndoes not follow that accident alone is sufficient to produce an\r\ninvention. The part which man plays is by no means a passive one. Even\r\nthe first potter in the primeval forest must have felt some stirrings of\r\ngenius within him. In all such cases, the inventor is obliged _to take\r\nnote_ of the new fact, he must discover and grasp its advantageous\r\nfeature, and must have the power to turn that feature to account in the\r\nrealisation of his purpose. He must _isolate_ the new feature, impress\r\nit upon his memory, unite and interweave it with the rest of his\r\nthought; in short, he must possess the capacity _to profit by\r\nexperience_.\r\n\r\nThe capacity to profit by experience might well be set up as a test of\r\nintelligence. This power varies considerably in men of the same race,\r\nand increases enormously as we advance from the lower animals to man.\r\nThe former are limited in this regard almost entirely to the reflex\r\nactions which they have inherited with their organism, they are almost\r\ntotally incapable of individual experience, and considering their simple\r\nwants are scarcely in need of it. The ivory-snail (_Eburna spirata_)\r\nnever learns to avoid the carnivorous Actinia, no matter how often it\r\nmay wince under the latter's shower of needles, apparently having no\r\nmemory for pain whatever.[86] A spider can be lured forth repeatedly\r\nfrom its hole by touching its web with a tuning-fork. The moth plunges\r\nagain and again into the flame which has burnt it. The humming-bird\r\nhawk-moth[87] dashes repeatedly against the painted roses of the\r\nwall-paper, like the unhappy and desperate thinker who never wearies of\r\nattacking the same insoluble chimerical problem. As aimlessly almost as\r\nMaxwell's gaseous molecules and in the same unreasoning manner common\r\nflies in their search for light and air stream against the glass pane of\r\na half-opened window and remain there from sheer inability to find their\r\nway around the narrow frame. But a pike separated from the minnows of\r\nhis aquarium by a glass partition, learns after the lapse of a few\r\nmonths, though only after having butted himself half to death, that he\r\ncannot attack these fishes with impunity. What is more, he leaves them\r\nin peace even after the removal of the partition, though he will bolt a\r\nstrange fish at once. Considerable memory must be attributed to birds of\r\npassage, a memory which, probably owing to the absence of disturbing\r\nthoughts, acts with the precision of that of some idiots. Finally, the\r\nsusceptibility to training evinced by the higher vertebrates is\r\nindisputable proof of the ability of these animals to profit by\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nA powerfully developed _mechanical_ memory, which recalls vividly and\r\nfaithfully old situations, is sufficient for avoiding definite\r\nparticular dangers, or for taking advantage of definite particular\r\nopportunities. But more is required for the development of _inventions_.\r\nMore extensive chains of images are necessary here, the excitation by\r\nmutual contact of widely different trains of ideas, a more powerful,\r\nmore manifold, and richer connexion of the contents of memory, a more\r\npowerful and impressionable psychical life, heightened by use. A man\r\nstands on the bank of a mountain-torrent, which is a serious obstacle to\r\nhim. He remembers that he has crossed just such a torrent before on the\r\ntrunk of a fallen tree. Hard by trees are growing. He has often moved\r\nthe trunks of fallen trees. He has also felled trees before, and then\r\nmoved them. To fell trees he has used sharp stones. He goes in search of\r\nsuch a stone, and as the old situations that crowd into his memory and\r\nare held there in living reality by the definite powerful interest which\r\nhe has in crossing just this torrent,--as these impressions are made to\r\npass before his mind in the _inverse order_ in which they were here\r\nevoked, he invents the bridge.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt but the higher vertebrates adapt their actions in\r\nsome moderate degree to circumstances. The fact that they give no\r\nappreciable evidence of advance by the accumulation of inventions, is\r\nsatisfactorily explained by a difference of degree or intensity of\r\nintelligence as compared with man; the assumption of a difference of\r\nkind is not necessary. A person who saves a little every day, be it ever\r\nso little, has an incalculable advantage over him who daily squanders\r\nthat amount, or is unable to keep what he has accumulated. A slight\r\nquantitative difference in such things explains enormous differences of\r\nadvancement.\r\n\r\nThe rules which hold good in prehistoric times also hold good in\r\nhistorical times, and the remarks made on invention may be applied\r\nalmost without modification to discovery; for the two are distinguished\r\nsolely by the use to which the new knowledge is put. In both cases the\r\ninvestigator is concerned with some _newly observed_ relation of new or\r\nold properties, abstract or concrete. It is observed, for example, that\r\na substance which gives a chemical reaction _A_ is also the cause of a\r\nchemical reaction _B_. If this observation fulfils no purpose but that\r\nof furthering the scientist's insight, or of removing a source of\r\nintellectual discomfort, we have a discovery; but an invention, if in\r\nusing the substance giving the reaction _A_ to produce the desired\r\nreaction _B_, we have a practical end in view, and seek to remove a\r\nsource of material discomfort. The phrase, _disclosure of the connexion\r\nof reactions_, is broad enough to cover discoveries and inventions in\r\nall departments. It embraces the Pythagorean proposition, which is a\r\ncombination of a geometrical and an arithmetical reaction, Newton's\r\ndiscovery of the connexion of Kepler's motions with the law of the\r\ninverse squares, as perfectly as it does the detection of some minute\r\nbut appropriate alteration in the construction of a tool, or of some\r\nappropriate change in the methods of a dyeing establishment.\r\n\r\nThe disclosure of new provinces of facts before unknown can only be\r\nbrought about by accidental circumstances, under which are _remarked_\r\nfacts that commonly go unnoticed. The achievement of the discoverer here\r\nconsists in his _sharpened attention_, which detects the uncommon\r\nfeatures of an occurrence and their determining conditions from their\r\nmost evanescent marks,[88] and discovers means of submitting them to\r\nexact and full observation. Under this head belong the first disclosures\r\nof electrical and magnetic phenomena, Grimaldi's observation of\r\ninterference, Arago's discovery of the increased check suffered by a\r\nmagnetic needle vibrating in a copper envelope as compared with that\r\nobserved in a bandbox, Foucault's observation of the stability of the\r\nplane of vibration of a rod accidentally struck while rotating in a\r\nturning-lathe, Mayer's observation of the increased redness of venous\r\nblood in the tropics, Kirchhoff's observation of the augmentation of the\r\n_D_-line in the solar spectrum by the interposition of a sodium lamp,\r\nSchönbein's discovery of ozone from the phosphoric smell emitted on the\r\ndisruption of air by electric sparks, and a host of others. All these\r\nfacts, of which unquestionably many were _seen_ numbers of times before\r\nthey were _noticed_, are examples of the inauguration of momentous\r\ndiscoveries by accidental circumstances, and place the importance of\r\nstrained attention in a brilliant light.\r\n\r\nBut not only is a significant part played in the beginning of an inquiry\r\nby co-operative circumstances beyond the foresight of the investigator;\r\ntheir influence is also active in its prosecution. Dufay, thus, whilst\r\nfollowing up the behavior of _one_ electrical state which he had\r\nassumed, discovers the existence of _two_. Fresnel learns by accident\r\nthat the interference-bands received on ground glass are seen to better\r\nadvantage in the open air. The diffraction-phenomenon of two slits\r\nproved to be considerably different from what Fraunhofer had\r\nanticipated, and in following up this circumstance he was led to the\r\nimportant discovery of grating-spectra. Faraday's induction-phenomenon\r\ndeparted widely from the initial conception which occasioned his\r\nexperiments, and it is precisely this deviation that constitutes his\r\nreal discovery.\r\n\r\nEvery man has pondered on some subject. Every one of us can multiply the\r\nexamples cited, by less illustrious ones from his own experience. I\r\nshall cite but one. On rounding a railway curve once, I accidentally\r\nremarked a striking apparent inclination of the houses and trees. I\r\ninferred that the direction of the total resultant _physical_\r\nacceleration of the body reacts _physiologically_ as the vertical.\r\nAfterwards, in attempting to inquire more carefully into this\r\nphenomenon, and this only, in a large whirling machine, the collateral\r\nphenomena conducted me to the sensation of angular acceleration,\r\nvertigo, Flouren's experiments on the section of the semi-circular\r\ncanals etc., from which gradually resulted views relating to sensations\r\nof direction which are also held by Breuer and Brown, which were at\r\nfirst contested on all hands, but are now regarded on many sides as\r\ncorrect, and which have been recently enriched by the interesting\r\ninquiries of Breuer concerning the _macula acustica_, and Kreidel's\r\nexperiments with magnetically orientable crustacea.[89] Not disregard of\r\naccident but a direct and purposeful employment of it advances research.\r\n\r\nThe more powerful the psychical connexion of the memory pictures\r\nis,--and it varies with the individual and the mood,--the more apt is\r\nthe same accidental observation to be productive of results. Galileo\r\nknows that the air has weight; he also knows of the \"resistance to a\r\nvacuum,\" expressed both in weight and in the height of a column of\r\nwater. But the two ideas dwelt asunder in his mind. It remained for\r\nTorricelli to vary the specific gravity of the liquid measuring the\r\npressure, and not till then was the air included in the list of\r\npressure-exerting fluids. The reversal of the lines of the spectrum was\r\nseen repeatedly before Kirchhoff, and had been mechanically explained.\r\nBut it was left for his penetrating vision to discern the evidence of\r\nthe connexion of this phenomenon with questions of heat, and to him\r\nalone through persistent labor was revealed the sweeping significance of\r\nthe fact for the mobile equilibrium of heat. Supposing, then, that such\r\na rich organic connexion of the elements of memory exists, and is the\r\nprime distinguishing mark of the inquirer, next in importance certainly\r\nis that _intense interest_ in a definite object, in a definite idea,\r\nwhich fashions advantageous combinations of thought from elements before\r\ndisconnected, and obtrudes that idea into every observation made, and\r\ninto every thought formed, making it enter into relationship with all\r\nthings. Thus Bradley, deeply engrossed with the subject of aberration,\r\nis led to its solution by an exceedingly unobtrusive experience in\r\ncrossing the Thames. It is permissible, therefore, to ask whether\r\naccident leads the discoverer, or the discoverer accident, to a\r\nsuccessful outcome in scientific quests.\r\n\r\nNo man should dream of solving a great problem unless he is so\r\nthoroughly saturated with his subject that everything else sinks into\r\ncomparative insignificance. During a hurried meeting with Mayer in\r\nHeidelberg once, Jolly remarked, with a rather dubious implication, that\r\nif Mayer's theory were correct water could be warmed by shaking. Mayer\r\nwent away without a word of reply. Several weeks later, and now\r\nunrecognised by Jolly, he rushed into the latter's presence exclaiming:\r\n\"Es ischt aso!\" (It is so, it is so!) It was only after considerable\r\nexplanation that Jolly found out what Mayer wanted to say. The incident\r\nneeds no comment.[90]\r\n\r\nA person deadened to sensory impressions and given up solely to the\r\npursuit of his own thoughts, may also light on an idea that will divert\r\nhis mental activity into totally new channels. In such cases it is a\r\npsychical accident, an intellectual experience, as distinguished from a\r\nphysical accident, to which the person owes his discovery--a discovery\r\nwhich is here made \"deductively\" by means of mental copies of the world,\r\ninstead of experimentally. _Purely_ experimental inquiry, moreover, does\r\nnot exist, for, as Gauss says, virtually we always experiment with our\r\nthoughts. And it is precisely that constant, corrective interchange or\r\nintimate union of experiment and deduction, as it was cultivated by\r\nGalileo in his _Dialogues_ and by Newton in his _Optics_, that is the\r\nfoundation of the benign fruitfulness of modern scientific inquiry as\r\ncontrasted with that of antiquity, where observation and reflexion\r\nofttimes pursued their respective courses like two strangers.\r\n\r\nWe have to wait for the appearance of a favorable physical accident. The\r\nmovement of our thoughts obeys the law of association. In the case of\r\nmeagre experience the result of this law is simply the mechanical\r\nreproduction of definite sensory experiences. On the other hand, if the\r\npsychical life is subjected to the incessant influences of a powerful\r\nand rich experience, then every representative element in the mind is\r\nconnected with so many others that the actual and natural course of the\r\nthoughts is easily influenced and determined by insignificant\r\ncircumstances, which accidentally are decisive. Hereupon, the process\r\ntermed imagination produces its protean and infinitely diversified\r\nforms. Now what can we do to guide this process, seeing that the\r\ncombinatory law of the images is without our reach? Rather let us ask,\r\nwhat influence can a powerful and constantly recurring idea exert on the\r\nmovement of our thoughts? According to what has preceded, the answer is\r\ninvolved in the question itself. The _idea_ dominates the thought of the\r\ninquirer, not the latter the former.\r\n\r\nLet us see, now, if we can acquire a profounder insight into the process\r\nof discovery. The condition of the discoverer is, as James has aptly\r\nremarked, not unlike the situation of a person who is trying to remember\r\nsomething that he has forgotten. Both are sensible of a gap, and have\r\nonly a remote presentiment of what is missing. Suppose I meet in a\r\ncompany a well-known and affable gentleman whose name I have forgotten,\r\nand who to my horror asks to be introduced to some one. I set to work\r\naccording to Lichtenberg's rule, and run down the alphabet in search of\r\nthe initial letter of his name. A vague sympathy holds me at the letter\r\n_G_. Tentatively I add the second letter and am arrested at _e_, and\r\nlong before I have tried the third letter _r_, the name \"Gerson\" sounds\r\nsonorously upon my ear, and my anguish is gone. While taking a walk I\r\nmeet a gentleman from whom I receive a communication. On returning home,\r\nand in attending to weightier affairs, the matter slips my mind.\r\nMoodily, but in vain, I ransack my memory. Finally I observe that I am\r\ngoing over my walk again in thought. On the street corner in question\r\nthe self-same gentleman stands before me and repeats his communication.\r\nIn this process are successively recalled to consciousness all the\r\npercepts which were connected with the percept that was lost, and with\r\nthem, finally, that, too, is brought to light. In the first case--where\r\nthe experience had already been made and is permanently impressed on our\r\nthought--a _systematic_ procedure is both possible and easy, for we know\r\nthat a name must be composed of a limited number of sounds. But at the\r\nsame time it should be observed that the labor involved in such a\r\ncombinatorial task would be enormous if the name were long and the\r\nresponsiveness of the mind weaker.\r\n\r\nIt is often said, and not wholly without justification, that the\r\nscientist has solved a _riddle_. Every problem in geometry may be\r\nclothed in the garb of a _riddle_. Thus: \"What thing is that _M_ which\r\nhas the properties _A_, _B_, _C_?\" \"What circle is that which touches\r\nthe straight lines _A_, _B_, but touches _B_ in the point _C_?\" The\r\nfirst two conditions marshal before the imagination the group of circles\r\nwhose centres lie in the line of symmetry of _A_, _B_. The third\r\ncondition reminds us of all the circles having centres in the straight\r\nline that stands at right angles to _B_ in _C_. The _common_ term, or\r\ncommon terms, of the two groups of images solves the riddle--satisfies\r\nthe problem. Puzzles dealing with things or words induce similar\r\nprocesses, but the memory in such cases is exerted in many directions\r\nand more varied and less clearly ordered provinces of ideas are\r\nsurveyed. The difference between the situation of a geometer who has a\r\nconstruction to make, and that of an engineer, or a scientist,\r\nconfronted with a problem, is simply this, that the first moves in a\r\nfield with which he is thoroughly acquainted, whereas the two latter are\r\nobliged to familiarise themselves with this field subsequently, and in a\r\nmeasure far transcending what is commonly required. In this process the\r\nmechanical engineer has at least always a definite goal before him and\r\ndefinite means to accomplish his aim, whilst in the case of the\r\nscientist that aim is in many instances presented only in vague and\r\ngeneral outlines. Often the very formulation of the riddle devolves on\r\nhim. Frequently it is not until the aim has been reached that the\r\nbroader outlook requisite for systematic procedure is obtained. By far\r\nthe larger portion of his success, therefore, is contingent on luck and\r\ninstinct. It is immaterial, so far as its character is concerned,\r\nwhether the process in question is brought rapidly to a conclusion in\r\nthe brain of one man, or whether it is spun out for centuries in the\r\nminds of a long succession of thinkers. The same relation that a word\r\nsolving a riddle bears to that riddle is borne by the modern conception\r\nof light to the facts discovered by Grimaldi, Römer, Huygens, Newton,\r\nYoung, Malus, and Fresnel, and only by the help of this slowly developed\r\nconception is our mental vision enabled to embrace the broad domain of\r\nfacts in question.\r\n\r\nA welcome complement to the discoveries which the history of\r\ncivilisation and comparative psychology have furnished, is to be found\r\nin the confessions of great scientists and artists. Scientists _and_\r\nartists, we might say, for Liebig boldly declared there was no essential\r\ndifference between the two. Are we to regard Leonardo da Vinci as a\r\nscientist or as an artist? If the artist builds up his work from a few\r\nmotives, the scientist discovers the motives which permeate reality. If\r\nscientists like Lagrange or Fourier are in a certain measure artists in\r\nthe presentation of their results, on the other hand, artists like\r\nShakespeare or Ruysdael are scientists in the insight which must have\r\npreceded their creations.\r\n\r\nNewton, when questioned about his methods of work, could give no other\r\nanswer but that he was wont to ponder again and again on a subject; and\r\nsimilar utterances are accredited to D'Alembert and Helmholtz.\r\nScientists and artists both recommend persistent labor. After the\r\nrepeated survey of a field has afforded opportunity for the\r\ninterposition of advantageous accidents, has rendered all the traits\r\nthat suit with the mood or the dominant thought more vivid, and has\r\ngradually relegated to the background all things that are inappropriate,\r\nmaking their future appearance impossible; then from the teeming,\r\nswelling host of fancies which a free and high-flown imagination calls\r\nforth, suddenly that particular form arises to the light which\r\nharmonises perfectly with the ruling idea, mood, or design. Then it is\r\nthat that which has resulted slowly as the result of a gradual\r\nselection, appears as if it were the outcome of a deliberate act of\r\ncreation. Thus are to be explained the statements of Newton, Mozart,\r\nRichard Wagner, and others, when they say that thoughts, melodies, and\r\nharmonies had poured in upon them, and that they had simply retained the\r\nright ones. Undoubtedly, the man of genius, too, consciously or\r\ninstinctively, pursues systematic methods wherever it is possible; but\r\nin his delicate presentiment he will omit many a task or abandon it\r\nafter a hasty trial on which a less endowed man would squander his\r\nenergies in vain. Thus, the genius accomplishes[91] in a brief space of\r\ntime undertakings for which the life of an ordinary man would far from\r\nsuffice. We shall hardly go astray if we regard genius as only a slight\r\ndeviation from the average mental endowment--as possessing simply a\r\ngreater sensitiveness of cerebral reaction and a greater swiftness of\r\nreaction. The men who, obeying their inner impulses, make sacrifices for\r\nan idea instead of advancing their material welfare, may appear to the\r\nfull-blooded Philistine as fools; yet we shall scarcely adopt Lombroso's\r\nview, that genius is to be regarded as a disease, although it is\r\nunfortunately true that the sensitive brains and fragile constitutions\r\nsuccumb most readily to sickness.\r\n\r\nThe remark of C. G. J. Jacobi that mathematics is slow of growth and\r\nonly reaches the truth by long and devious paths, that the way to its\r\ndiscovery must be prepared for long beforehand, and that then the truth\r\nwill make its long-deferred appearance as if impelled by some divine\r\nnecessity[92]--all this holds true of every science. We are astounded\r\noften to note that it required the combined labors of many eminent\r\nthinkers for a full century to reach a truth which it takes us only a\r\nfew hours to master and which once acquired seems extremely easy to\r\nreach under the right sort of circumstances. To our humiliation we learn\r\nthat even the greatest men are born more for life than for science. The\r\nextent to which even they are indebted to accident--to that singular\r\nconflux of the physical and the psychical life in which the continuous\r\nbut yet imperfect and never-ending adaptation of the latter to the\r\nformer finds its distinct expression--that has been the subject of our\r\nremarks to-day. Jacobi's poetical thought of a divine necessity acting\r\nin science will lose none of its loftiness for us if we discover in this\r\nnecessity the same power that destroys the unfit and fosters the fit.\r\nFor loftier, nobler, and more romantic than poetry is the truth and the\r\nreality.\r\n\r\n  FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 81: Inaugural lecture delivered on assuming the\r\n  Professorship of the History and Theory of Inductive Science in the\r\n  University of Vienna, October 21, 1895.]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 82: The phrase is, _Er hat das Pulver nicht erfunden_.]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 83: \"Quod si quis tanta industria exstitisset, ut ex\r\n  naturae principiis at geometria hanc rem eruere potuisset, eum ego\r\n  supra mortalium sortem ingenio valuisse dicendum crederem.

I presume that you are already acquainted with the\r\nphysiological part of the processes with which our sensations of\r\nmovement, or, more generally speaking, our sensations of orientation,\r\nare connected. Here I shall consider more particularly the physical side\r\nof the matter. In fact, I was originally led to the consideration of\r\nthese questions by the observation of extremely simple and perfectly\r\nwell-known physical facts, before I had any great acquaintance with\r\nphysiology and while pursuing unbiasedly my natural thoughts; and I am\r\nof the conviction that the way which I have pursued, and which is\r\nentirely free from hypotheses, will, if you will follow my exposition,\r\nbe that of easiest acquisition for the most of you.\r\n\r\nNo man of sound common sense could ever have doubted that a pressure or\r\nforce is requisite to set a body in motion in a given direction and that\r\na contrary pressure is required to stop suddenly a body in motion.\r\nThough the law of inertia was first formulated with anything like\r\nexactness by Galileo, the facts at the basis of it were known long\r\npreviously to men of the stamp of Leonardo da Vinci, Rabelais, and\r\nothers, and were illustrated by them with appropriate experiments.\r\nLeonardo knew that by a swift stroke with a ruler one can knock out from\r\na vertical column of checkers a single checker without over-throwing the\r\ncolumn. The experiment with a coin resting on a piece of pasteboard\r\ncovering a goblet, which falls into the goblet when the pasteboard is\r\njerked away, like all experiments of the kind, is certainly very old.\r\n\r\nWith Galileo the experience in question assumes greater clearness and\r\nforce. In the famous dialogue on the Copernican system which cost him\r\nhis freedom, he explains the tides in an unfelicitous, though in\r\nprinciple correct manner, by the analogue of a platter of water swung to\r\nand fro. In opposition to the Aristotelians of his time, who believed\r\nthe descent of a heavy body could be accelerated by the superposition\r\nof another heavy body, he asserted that a body could never be\r\naccelerated by one lying upon it unless the first in some way impeded\r\nthe superposed body in its descent. To seek to press a falling body by\r\nmeans of another placed upon it, is as senseless as trying to prod a man\r\nwith a lance when the man is speeding away from one with the same\r\nvelocity as the lance. Even this little excursion into physics can\r\nexplain much to us. You know the peculiar sensation which one has in\r\nfalling, as when one jumps from a high springboard into the water, and\r\nwhich is also experienced in some measure at the beginning of the\r\ndescent of elevators and swings. The reciprocal gravitational pressure\r\nof the different parts of our body, which is certainly felt in some\r\nmanner, vanishes in free descent, or, in the case of the elevator, is\r\ndiminished on the beginning of the descent. A similar sensation would be\r\nexperienced if we were suddenly transported to the moon where the\r\nacceleration of gravity is much less than upon the earth. I was led to\r\nthese considerations in 1866 by a suggestion in physics, and having also\r\ntaken into account the alterations of the blood-pressure in the cases in\r\nquestion, I found I coincided without knowing it with Wollaston and\r\nPurkinje. The first as early as 1810 in his Croonian lecture had touched\r\non the subject of sea-sickness and explained it by alterations of the\r\nblood-pressure, and later had laid similar considerations at the basis\r\nof his explanation of vertigo (1820-1826).[94]\r\n\r\nNewton was the first to enunciate with perfect generality that a body\r\ncan change the velocity and direction of its motion only by the action\r\nof a force, or the action of a second body. A corollary of this law\r\nwhich was first expressly deduced by Euler is that a body can never be\r\nset _rotating_ or made to cease rotating of itself but only by forces\r\nand other bodies. For example, turn an open watch which has run down\r\nfreely backwards and forwards in your hand. The balance-wheel will not\r\nfully catch the rapid rotations, it does not even respond fully to the\r\nelastic force of the spring which proves too weak to carry the wheel\r\nentirely with it.\r\n\r\nLet us consider now that whether we move ourselves by means of our legs,\r\nor whether we are moved by a vehicle or a boat, at first only a part of\r\nour body is directly moved and the rest of it is afterwards set in\r\nmotion by the first part. We see that pressures, pulls, and tensions are\r\nalways produced between the parts of the body in this action, which\r\npressures, pulls, and tensions give rise to sensations by which the\r\nforward or rotary movements in which we are engaged are made\r\nperceptible.[95] But it is quite natural that sensations so familiar\r\nshould be little noticed and that attention should be drawn to them only\r\nunder special circumstances when they occur unexpectedly or with unusual\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45.]\r\n\r\nThus my attention was drawn to this point by the sensation of falling\r\nand subsequently by another singular occurrence. I was rounding a sharp\r\nrailway curve once when I suddenly saw all the trees, houses, and\r\nfactory chimneys along the track swerve from the vertical and assume a\r\nstrikingly inclined position. What had hitherto appeared to me perfectly\r\nnatural, namely, the fact that we distinguish the vertical so perfectly\r\nand sharply from every other direction, now struck me as enigmatical.\r\nWhy is it that the same direction can now appear vertical to me and now\r\ncannot? By what is the vertical distinguished for us? (Compare Figure\r\n45.)\r\n\r\nThe rails are raised on the convex or outward side of the track in order\r\nto insure the stability of the carriage as against the action of the\r\ncentrifugal force, the whole being so arranged that the combination of\r\nthe force of gravity with the centrifugal force of the train shall give\r\nrise to a force perpendicular to the plane of the rails.\r\n\r\nLet us assume, now, that under all circumstances we somehow sense the\r\ndirection of the total resultant mass-acceleration whencesoever it may\r\narise as the vertical. Then both the ordinary and the extraordinary\r\nphenomena will be alike rendered intelligible.[96]\r\n\r\nI was now desirous of putting the view I had reached to a more\r\nconvenient and exact test than was possible on a railway journey where\r\none has no control over the determining circumstances and cannot alter\r\nthem at will. I accordingly had the simple apparatus constructed which\r\nis represented in Figure 46.\r\n\r\nIn a large frame _BB_, which is fastened to the walls, rotates about a\r\nvertical axis _AA_ a second frame _RR_, and within the latter a third\r\none _rr_, which can be set at any distance and position from the axis,\r\nmade stationary or movable, and is provided with a chair for the\r\nobserver.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46.\r\n\r\nFrom Mach's _Bewegungsempfindungen_, Leipsic, Engelmann, 1875.]\r\n\r\nThe observer takes his seat in the chair and to prevent disturbances of\r\njudgment is enclosed in a paper box. If the observer together with the\r\nframe _rr_ be then set in uniform rotation, he will feel and see the\r\nbeginning of the rotation both as to direction and amount very\r\ndistinctly although every outward visible or tangible point of reference\r\nis wanting. If the motion be uniformly continued the sensation of\r\nrotation will gradually cease entirely and the observer will imagine\r\nhimself at rest. But if _rr_ be placed outside the axis of rotation, at\r\nonce on the rotation beginning, a strikingly apparent, palpable,\r\nactually visible inclination of the entire paper box is produced, slight\r\nwhen the rotation is slow, strong when the rotation is rapid, and\r\ncontinuing as long as the rotation lasts. It is absolutely impossible\r\nfor the observer to escape perceiving the inclination, although here\r\nalso all outward points of reference are wanting. If the observer, for\r\nexample, is seated so as to look towards the axis, he will feel the box\r\nstrongly tipped backwards, as it necessarily must be if the direction of\r\nthe total resultant force is perceived as the vertical. For other\r\npositions of the observer the situation is similar.[97]\r\n\r\nOnce, while performing one of these experiments, and after rotating so\r\nlong that I was no longer conscious of the movement, I suddenly caused\r\nthe apparatus to be stopped, whereupon I immediately felt and saw myself\r\nwith the whole box rapidly flung round in rotation in the opposite\r\ndirection, although I knew that the whole apparatus was at rest and\r\nevery outward point of reference for the perception of motion was\r\nwanting. Every one who disbelieves in sensations of movement should be\r\nmade acquainted with these phenomena. Had Newton known them and had he\r\never observed how we may actually imagine ourselves turned and displaced\r\nin space without the assistance of stationary bodies as points of\r\nreference, he would certainly have been confirmed more than ever in his\r\nunfortunate speculations regarding absolute space.\r\n\r\nThe sensation of rotation in the opposite direction after the apparatus\r\nhas been stopped, slowly and gradually ceases. But on accidentally\r\ninclining my head once during this occurrence, the axis of apparent\r\nrotation was also observed to incline in exactly the same manner both as\r\nto direction and as to amount. It is accordingly clear that the\r\nacceleration or retardation of rotation is felt. The acceleration\r\noperates as a stimulus. The sensation, however, like almost all\r\nsensations, though it gradually decreases, lasts perceptibly longer than\r\nthe stimulus. Hence the long continued apparent rotation after the\r\nstopping of the apparatus. The organ, however, which causes the\r\npersistence of this sensation must have its seat in the _head_, since\r\notherwise the axis of apparent rotation could not assume the same motion\r\nas the head.\r\n\r\nIf I were to say, now, that a light had flashed upon me in making these\r\nlast observations, the expression would be a feeble one. I ought to say\r\nI experienced a perfect illumination. My juvenile experiences of vertigo\r\noccurred to me. I remembered Flourens's experiments relative to the\r\nsection of the semi-circular canals of the labyrinths of doves and\r\nrabbits, where this inquirer had observed phenomena similar to vertigo,\r\nbut which he preferred to interpret, from his bias to the acoustic\r\ntheory of the labyrinth, as the expression of painful auditive\r\ndisturbances. I saw that Goltz had nearly but not quite hit the bull's\r\neye with his theory of the semi-circular canals. This inquirer, who,\r\nfrom his happy habit of following his own natural thoughts without\r\nregard for tradition, has cleared up so much in science, spoke, as early\r\nas 1870, on the ground of experiments, as follows: \"It is uncertain\r\nwhether the semi-circular canals are auditive organs or not. In any\r\nevent they form an apparatus which serves for the preservation of\r\nequilibrium. They are, so to speak, the sense-organs of equilibrium of\r\nthe head and indirectly of the whole body.\" I remembered the galvanic\r\ndizziness which had been observed by Ritter and Purkinje on the passage\r\nof a current through the head, when the persons experimented upon\r\nimagined they were falling towards the cathode. The experiment was\r\nimmediately repeated, and sometime later (1874) I was enabled to\r\ndemonstrate the same objectively with fishes, all of which placed\r\nthemselves sidewise and in the same direction in the field of the\r\ncurrent as if at command.[98] Müller's doctrine of specific energies now\r\nappeared to me to bring all these new and old observations into a\r\nsimple, connected unity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47.\r\n\r\nThe labyrinth of a dove (stereoscopically reproduced), from R. Ewald,\r\n_Nervus Octavus_, Wiesbaden, Bergmann, 1892.]\r\n\r\nLet us picture to ourselves the labyrinth of the ear with its three\r\nsemi-circular canals lying in three mutually perpendicular planes (Comp.\r\nFig. 47), the mysterious position of which inquirers have endeavored to\r\nexplain in every possible and impossible way. Let us conceive the nerves\r\nof the ampullæ, or the dilated extensions of the semi-circular canals,\r\nequipped with a capacity for responding to every imaginable stimulus\r\nwith a sensation of rotation just as the nerves of the retina of the eye\r\nwhen excited by pressures, by electrical or chemical stimuli always\r\nrespond with the sensation of light; let us picture to ourselves,\r\nfurther, that the usual excitation of the ampullæ nerves is produced by\r\nthe inertia of the contents of the semi-circular canals, which contents\r\non suitable rotations in the plane of the semi-circular canal are left\r\nbehind in the motion, or at least have a tendency to remain behind and\r\nconsequently exert a pressure. It will be seen that on this supposition\r\nall the single facts which without the theory appear as so many\r\ndifferent individual phenomena, become from this single point of view\r\nclear and intelligible.\r\n\r\nI had the satisfaction, immediately after the communication in which I\r\nset forth this idea,[99] of seeing a paper by Breuer appear[100] in\r\nwhich this author had arrived by entirely different methods at results\r\nthat agreed in all essential points with my own. A few weeks later\r\nappeared the researches of Crum Brown of Edinburgh, whose methods were\r\neven still nearer mine. Breuer's paper was far richer in physiological\r\nrespects than mine, and he had particularly gone into greater detail in\r\nhis investigation of the collateral effects of the reflex motions and\r\norientation of the eyes in the phenomena under consideration.[101] In\r\naddition certain experiments which I had suggested in my paper as a test\r\nof the correctness of the view in question had already been performed by\r\nBreuer. Breuer has also rendered services of the highest order in the\r\nfurther elaboration of this field. But in a physical regard, my paper\r\nwas, of course, more complete.\r\n\r\nIn order to portray to the eye the behavior of the semi-circular canals,\r\nI have constructed here a little apparatus. (See Fig. 48.) The large\r\nrotatable disc represents the osseous semi-circular canal, which is\r\ncontinuous with the bones of the head; the small disc, which is free to\r\nrotate on the axis of the first, represents the mobile and partly liquid\r\ncontents of the semi-circular canal. On rotating the large disc, the\r\nsmall disc as you see remains behind. I have to turn some time before\r\nthe small disc is carried along with the large one by friction. But if I\r\nnow stop the large disc the small disc as you see continues to rotate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48.\r\n\r\nModel representing the action of the semi-circular canals.]\r\n\r\nSimply assume now that the rotation of the small disc, say in the\r\ndirection of the hands of a watch, would give rise to a sensation of\r\nrotation in the opposite direction, and conversely, and you already\r\nunderstand a good portion of the facts above set forth. The explanation\r\nstill holds, even if the small disc does not perform appreciable\r\nrotations but is checked by a contrivance similar to an elastic spring,\r\nthe tension of which disengages a sensation. Conceive, now, three such\r\ncontrivances with their mutually perpendicular planes of rotation joined\r\ntogether so as to form a single apparatus; then to this apparatus as a\r\nwhole, no rotation can be imparted without its being indicated by the\r\nsmall mobile discs or by the springs which are attached to them.\r\nConceive both the right and the left ear equipped with such an\r\napparatus, and you will find that it answers all the purposes of the\r\nsemi-circular canals, which you see represented stereoscopically in Fig.\r\n47 for the ear of a dove.\r\n\r\nOf the many experiments which I have made on my own person, and the\r\nresults of which could be predicted by the new view according to the\r\nbehavior of the model and consequently according to the rules of\r\nmechanics, I shall cite but one. I fasten a horizontal board in the\r\nframe _RR_ of my rotatory apparatus, lie down upon the same with my\r\nright ear upon the board, and cause the apparatus to be uniformly\r\nrotated. As soon as I no longer perceive the rotation, I turn around\r\nupon my left ear and immediately the sensation of rotation again starts\r\nup with marked vividness. The experiment can be repeated as often as one\r\nwishes. A slight turn of the head even is sufficient for reviving the\r\nsensation of rotation which in the perfectly quiescent state at once\r\ndisappears altogether.\r\n\r\nWe will imitate the experiment on the model. I turn the large disc until\r\nfinally the small disc is carried along with it. If, now, while the\r\nrotation continues uniform, I burn off a little thread which you see\r\nhere, the small disc will be flipped round by a spring into its own\r\nplane 180°, so as now to present its opposite side to you, when the\r\nrotation at once begins in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nWe have consequently a very simple means for determining whether one is\r\nactually the subject or not of uniform and imperceptible rotations. If\r\nthe earth rotated much more rapidly than it really does, or if our\r\nsemi-circular canals were much more sensitive, a Nansen sleeping at the\r\nNorth Pole would be waked by a sensation of rotation every time he\r\nturned over. Foucault's pendulum experiment as a demonstration of the\r\nearth's rotation would be superfluous under such circumstances. The only\r\nreason we cannot prove the rotation of the earth with the help of our\r\nmodel, lies in the small angular velocity of the earth and in the\r\nconsequent liability to great experimental errors.[102]\r\n\r\nAristotle has said that \"The sweetest of all things is knowledge.\" And\r\nhe is right. But if you were to suppose that the _publication_ of a new\r\nview were productive of unbounded sweetness, you would be mightily\r\nmistaken. No one disturbs his fellow-men with a new view unpunished. Nor\r\nshould the fact be made a subject of reproach to these fellow-men. To\r\npresume to revolutionise the current way of thinking with regard to any\r\nquestion, is no pleasant task, and above all not an easy one. They who\r\nhave advanced new views know best what serious difficulties stand in\r\ntheir way. With honest and praiseworthy zeal, men set to work in search\r\nof everything that does not suit with them. They seek to discover\r\nwhether they cannot explain the facts better or as well, or\r\napproximately as well, by the traditional views. And that, too, is\r\njustified. But at times some extremely artless animadversions are heard\r\nthat almost nonplus us. \"If a sixth sense existed it could not fail to\r\nhave been discovered thousands of years ago.\" Indeed; there was a time,\r\nthen, when only seven planets could have existed! But I do not believe\r\nthat any one will lay any weight on the philological question whether\r\nthe set of phenomena which we have been considering should be called a\r\nsense. The phenomena will not disappear when the name disappears. It was\r\nfurther said to me that animals exist which have no labyrinth, but which\r\ncan yet orientate themselves, and that consequently the labyrinth has\r\nnothing to do with orientation. We do not walk forsooth with our legs,\r\nbecause snakes propel themselves without them!\r\n\r\nBut if the promulgator of a new idea cannot hope for any great pleasure\r\nfrom its publication, yet the critical process which his views undergo\r\nis extremely helpful to the subject-matter of them. All the defects\r\nwhich necessarily adhere to the new view are gradually discovered and\r\neliminated. Over-rating and exaggeration give way to more sober\r\nestimates. And so it came about that it was found unpermissible to\r\nattribute all functions of orientation exclusively to the labyrinth. In\r\nthese critical labors Delage, Aubert, Breuer, Ewald, and others have\r\nrendered distinguished services. It can also not fail to happen that\r\nfresh facts become known in this process which could have been predicted\r\nby the new view, which actually were predicted in part, and which\r\nconsequently furnish a support for the new view. Breuer and Ewald\r\nsucceeded in electrically and mechanically exciting the labyrinth, and\r\neven single parts of the labyrinth, and thus in producing the movements\r\nthat belong to such stimuli. It was shown that when the semi-circular\r\ncanals were absent vertigo could not be produced, when the entire\r\nlabyrinth was removed the orientation of the head was no longer\r\npossible, that without the labyrinth galvanic vertigo could not be\r\ninduced. I myself constructed as early as 1875 an apparatus for\r\nobserving animals in rotation, which was subsequently reinvented in\r\nvarious forms and has since received the name of \"cyclostat.\"[103] In\r\nexperiments with the most varied kinds of animals it was shown that, for\r\nexample, the larvæ of frogs are not subject to vertigo until their\r\nsemi-circular canals which at the start are wanting are developed (K.\r\nSchäfer). A large percentage of the deaf and dumb are afflicted with\r\ngrave affections of the labyrinth. The American psychologist, William\r\nJames, has made whirling experiments with many deaf and dumb subjects,\r\nand in a large number of them found that susceptibility to giddiness is\r\nwanting. He also found that many deaf and dumb people on being ducked\r\nunder water, whereby they lose their weight and consequently have no\r\nlonger the full assistance of their muscular sense, utterly lose their\r\nsense of position in space, do not know which is up and which is down,\r\nand are thrown into the greatest consternation,--results which do not\r\noccur in normal men. Such facts are convincing proof that we do not\r\norientate ourselves entirely by means of the labyrinth, important as it\r\nis for us. Dr. Kreidl has made experiments similar to those of James and\r\nfound that not only is vertigo absent in deaf and dumb people when\r\nwhirled about, but that also the reflex movements of the eyes which are\r\nnormally induced by the labyrinth are wanting. Finally, Dr. Pollak has\r\nfound that galvanic vertigo does not exist in a large percentage of the\r\ndeaf and dumb. Neither the jerking movements nor the uniform movements\r\nof the eyes were observed which normal human beings exhibit in the\r\nRitter and Purkinje experiment.\r\n\r\nAfter the physicist has arrived at the idea that the semi-circular\r\ncanals are the organ of sensation of rotation or of angular\r\nacceleration, he is next constrained to ask for the organs that mediate\r\nthe sensation of acceleration noticed in forward movements. In\r\nsearching for an organ for this function, he of course is not apt to\r\nselect one that stands in no anatomical and spatial relation with the\r\nsemi-circular canals. And in addition there are physiological\r\nconsiderations to be weighed. The preconceived opinion once having been\r\nabandoned that the _entire_ labyrinth is auditory in its function, there\r\nremains after the cochlea is reserved for sensations of tone and the\r\nsemi-circular canals for the sensation of angular acceleration, the\r\nvestibule for the discharge of additional functions. The vestibule,\r\nparticularly the part of it known as the sacculus, appeared to me, by\r\nreason of the so-called otoliths which it contains, eminently adapted\r\nfor being the organ of sensation of forward acceleration or of the\r\nposition of the head. In this conjecture I again closely coincided with\r\nBreuer.\r\n\r\nThat a sensation of position, of direction and amount of\r\nmass-acceleration exists, our experience in elevators as well as of\r\nmovement in curved paths is sufficient proof. I have also attempted to\r\nproduce and destroy suddenly great velocities of forward movement by\r\nmeans of various contrivances of which I shall mention only one here.\r\nIf, while enclosed in the paper box of my large whirling apparatus at\r\nsome distance from the axis, my body is in uniform rotation which I no\r\nlonger feel, and I then loosen the connexions of the frame _rr_ with _R_\r\nthus making the former moveable and I then suddenly stop the larger\r\nframe, my forward motion is abruptly impeded while the frame _rr_\r\ncontinues to rotate. I imagine now that I am speeding on in a straight\r\nline in a direction opposite to that of the checked motion.\r\nUnfortunately, for many reasons it cannot be proved convincingly that\r\nthe organ in question has its seat in the head. According to the opinion\r\nof Delage, the labyrinth has nothing to do with this particular\r\nsensation of movement. Breuer, on the other hand, is of the opinion that\r\nthe organ of forward movement in man is stunted and the persistence of\r\nthe sensation in question is too brief to permit our instituting\r\nexperiments as obvious as in the case of rotation. In fact, Crum Brown\r\nonce observed while in an irritated condition peculiar vertical\r\nphenomena in his own person, which were all satisfactorily explained by\r\nan abnormally long persistence of the sensation of rotation, and I\r\nmyself in an analogous case on the stopping of a railway train felt the\r\napparent backward motion in striking intensity and for an unusual length\r\nof time.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt whatever that we feel changes of vertical\r\nacceleration, and it will appear from the following extremely probable\r\nthat the otoliths of the vestibule are the sense-organ for the\r\n_direction_ of the mass-acceleration. It will then be incompatible with\r\na really logical view to regard the latter as incapable of sensing\r\nhorizontal accelerations.\r\n\r\nIn the lower animals the analogue of the labyrinth is shrunk to a little\r\nvesicle filled with a liquid and containing tiny crystals, auditive\r\nstones, or otoliths, of greater specific gravity, suspended on minute\r\nhairs. These crystals appear physically well adapted for indicating both\r\nthe direction of gravity and the direction of incipient movements. That\r\nthey discharge the former function, Delage was the first to convince\r\nhimself by experiments with lower animals which on the removal of the\r\notoliths utterly lost their bearings and could no longer regain their\r\nnormal position. Loeb also found that fishes without labyrinths swim now\r\non their bellies and now on their backs. But the most remarkable, most\r\nbeautiful, and most convincing experiment is that which Dr. Kreidl\r\ninstituted with crustaceans. According to Hensen, certain Crustacea on\r\nsloughing spontaneously introduce fine grains of sand as auditive stones\r\ninto their otolith vesicle. At the ingenious suggestion of S. Exner, Dr.\r\nKreidl constrained some of these animals to put up with iron filings\r\n(_ferrum limatum_). If the pole of an electro-magnet be brought near the\r\nanimal, it will at once turn its back away from the pole accompanying\r\nthe movement with appropriate reflex motions of the eye the moment the\r\ncurrent is closed, exactly as if gravity had been brought to bear upon\r\nthe animal in the same direction as the magnetic force.[104] This, in\r\nfact, is what should be expected from the function ascribed to the\r\notoliths. If the eyes be covered with asphalt varnish, and the auditive\r\nsacs removed, the crustaceans lose their sense of direction utterly,\r\ntumble head over heels, lie on their side or their back indifferently.\r\nThis does not happen when the eyes only are covered. For vertebrates,\r\nBreuer has demonstrated by searching investigations that the otoliths,\r\nor better, statoliths, slide in three planes parallel to the planes of\r\nthe semi-circular canals, and are consequently perfectly adapted for\r\nindicating changes both in the amount and the direction of the\r\nmass-acceleration.[105]\r\n\r\nI have already remarked that not every function of orientation can be\r\nascribed exclusively to the labyrinth. The deaf and dumb who have to be\r\nimmersed in water, and the crustaceans who must have their eyes closed\r\nif they are to be perfectly disorientated, are proof of this fact. I saw\r\na blind cat at Hering's laboratory which to one who was not a very\r\nattentive observer behaved exactly like a seeing cat. It played nimbly\r\nwith objects rolling on the floor, stuck its head inquisitively into\r\nopen drawers, sprang dexterously upon chairs, ran with perfect accuracy\r\nthrough open doors, and never bumped against closed ones. The visual\r\nsense had here been rapidly replaced by the tactual and auditive senses.\r\nAnd it appears from Ewald's investigations that even after the\r\nlabyrinths have been removed, animals gradually learn to move about\r\nagain quite in the normal fashion, presumably because the eliminated\r\nfunction of the labyrinth is now performed by some part of the brain. A\r\ncertain peculiar weakness of the muscles alone is perceptible which\r\nEwald ascribes to the absence of the stimulus which is otherwise\r\nconstantly emitted by the labyrinth (the labyrinth-tonus). But if the\r\npart of the brain which discharges the deputed function be removed, the\r\nanimals are again completely disorientated and absolutely helpless.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that the views enunciated by Breuer, Crum Brown and\r\nmyself in 1873 and 1874, and which are substantially a fuller and richer\r\ndevelopment of Goltz's idea, have upon the whole been substantiated. At\r\nleast they have exercised a helpful and stimulative influence. New\r\nproblems have of course arisen in the course of the investigation which\r\nstill await solution, and much work remains to be done. At the same time\r\nwe see how fruitful the renewed co-operation of the various special\r\ndepartments of science may become after a period of isolation and\r\ninvigorating labor apart.\r\n\r\nI may be permitted, therefore, to consider the relation between hearing\r\nand orientation from another and more general point of view. What we\r\ncall the auditive organ is in the lower animals simply a sac containing\r\nauditive stones. As we ascend the scale, 1, 2, 3 semi-circular canals\r\ngradually develop from them, whilst the structure of the otolith organ\r\nitself becomes more complicated. Finally, in the higher vertebrates, and\r\nparticularly in the mammals, a part of the latter organ (the lagena)\r\nbecomes the cochlea, which Helmholtz explained as the organ for\r\nsensations of tone. In the belief that the entire labyrinth was an\r\nauditive organ, Helmholtz, contrary to the results of his own masterly\r\nanalysis, originally sought to interpret another part of the labyrinth\r\nas the organ of noises. I showed a long time ago (1873) that every tonal\r\nstimulus by shortening the duration of the excitation to a few\r\nvibrations, gradually loses its character of pitch and takes on that of\r\na sharp, dry report or noise.[106] All the intervening stages between\r\ntones and noises can be exhibited. Such being the case, it will hardly\r\nbe assumed that one organ is suddenly and at some given point replaced\r\nin function by another. On the basis of different experiments and\r\nreasonings S. Exner also regards the assumption of a special organ for\r\nthe sensing of noises as unnecessary.\r\n\r\nIf we will but reflect how small a portion of the labyrinth of higher\r\nanimals is apparently in the service of the sense of hearing, and how\r\nlarge, on the other hand, the portion is which very likely serves the\r\npurposes of orientation, how much the first anatomical beginnings of the\r\nauditive sac of lower animals resemble that part of the fully developed\r\nlabyrinth which does not hear, the view is irresistibly suggested which\r\nBreuer and I (1874, 1875) expressed, that the auditive organ took its\r\ndevelopment from an organ for sensing movements by adaptation to weak\r\nperiodic motional stimuli, and that many apparatuses in the lower\r\nanimals which are held to be organs of hearing are not auditive organs\r\nat all.[107]\r\n\r\nThis view appears to be perceptibly gaining ground. Dr. Kreidl by\r\nskilfully-planned experiments has arrived at the conclusion that even\r\nfishes do not hear, whereas E. H. Weber, in his day, regarded the\r\nossicles which unite the air-bladder of fishes with the labyrinth as\r\norgans expressly designed for conducting sound from the former to the\r\nlatter.[108] Störensen has investigated the excitation of sounds by the\r\nair-bladder of fishes, as also the conduction of shocks through Weber's\r\nossicles. He regards the air-bladder as particularly adapted for\r\nreceiving the noises made by other fishes and conducting them to the\r\nlabyrinth. He has heard the loud grunting tones of the fishes in South\r\nAmerican rivers, and is of the opinion that they allure and find each\r\nother in this manner. According to these views certain fishes are\r\nneither deaf nor dumb.[109] The question here involved might be solved\r\nperhaps by sharply distinguishing between the sensation of hearing\r\nproper, and the perception of shocks. The first-mentioned sensation may,\r\neven in the case of many vertebrates, be extremely restricted, or\r\nperhaps even absolutely wanting. But besides the auditive function,\r\nWeber's ossicles may perfectly well discharge some other function.\r\nAlthough, as Moreau has shown, the air-bladder itself is not an organ of\r\nequilibrium in the simple physical sense of Borelli, yet doubtless some\r\nfunction of this character is still reserved for it. The union with the\r\nlabyrinth favors this conception, and so a host of new problems rises\r\nhere before us.\r\n\r\nI should like to close with a reminiscence from the year 1863.\r\nHelmholtz's _Sensations of Tone_ had just been published and the\r\nfunction of the cochlea now appeared clear to the whole world. In a\r\nprivate conversation which I had with a physician, the latter declared\r\nit to be an almost hopeless undertaking to seek to fathom the function\r\nof the other parts of the labyrinth, whereas I in youthful boldness\r\nmaintained that the question could hardly fail to be solved, and that\r\nvery soon, although of course I had then no glimmering of how it was to\r\nbe done. Ten years later the question was substantially solved.\r\n\r\nTo-day, after having tried my powers frequently and in vain on many\r\nquestions, I no longer believe that we can make short work of the\r\nproblems of science. Nevertheless, I should not consider an\r\n\"ignorabimus\" as an expression of modesty, but rather as the opposite.\r\nThat expression is a suitable one only with regard to problems which are\r\nwrongly formulated and which are therefore not problems at all. Every\r\nreal problem can and will be solved in due course of time without\r\nsupernatural divination, entirely by accurate observation and close,\r\nsearching thought.\r\n\r\n  FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 93: A lecture delivered on February 24, 1897, before the\r\n  _Verein zur Verbreitung naturwissenschaftlicher Kenntnisse in\r\n  Wien_.]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 94: Wollaston, _Philosophical Transactions, Royal\r\n  Society_, 1810.

Since, then, shooting and all that\r\nappertains thereto, is a very important, if not the most important,\r\naffair of modern life, you will doubtless not be averse to giving your\r\nattention for an hour to some experiments which have been undertaken,\r\nnot for advancing the ends of war, but for promoting the ends of\r\nscience, and which throw some light on the phenomena attending the\r\nflight of projectiles.\r\n\r\nModern science strives to construct its picture of the world not from\r\nspeculations but so far as possible from facts. It verifies its\r\nconstructs by recourse to observation. Every newly observed fact\r\ncompletes its world-picture, and every divergence of a construct from\r\nobservation points to some imperfection, to some lacuna in it. What is\r\nseen is put to the test of, and supplemented by, what is thought, which\r\nis again naught but the result of things previously seen. It is always\r\npeculiarly fascinating, therefore, to subject to direct verification by\r\nobservation, that is, to render palpable to the senses, something which\r\nwe have only theoretically excogitated or theoretically surmised.\r\n\r\nIn 1881, on hearing in Paris the lecture of the Belgian artillerist\r\nMelsens, who hazarded the conjecture that projectiles travelling at a\r\nhigh rate of speed carry masses of compressed air before them which are\r\ninstrumental in producing in bodies struck by the projectiles certain\r\nwell-known facts of the nature of explosions, the desire arose in me of\r\nexperimentally testing his conjecture and of rendering the phenomenon,\r\nif it really existed, perceptible. The desire was the stronger as I\r\ncould say that all the means for realising it existed, and that I had in\r\npart already used and tested them for other purposes.\r\n\r\nAnd first let us get clear regarding the difficulties which have to be\r\nsurmounted. Our task is that of observing a bullet or other projectile\r\nwhich is rushing through space at a velocity of many hundred yards a\r\nsecond, together with the disturbances which the bullet causes in the\r\nsurrounding atmosphere. Even the opaque solid body itself, the\r\nprojectile, is only exceptionally visible under such circumstances--only\r\nwhen it is of considerable size and when we see its line of flight in\r\nstrong perspective abridgement so that the velocity is apparently\r\ndiminished. We see a large projectile quite clearly when we stand behind\r\nthe cannon and look steadily along its line of flight or in the less\r\npleasant case when the projectile is speeding towards us. There is,\r\nhowever, a very simple and effective method of observing swiftly moving\r\nbodies with as little trouble as if they were held at rest at some point\r\nin their path. The method is that of illumination by a brilliant\r\nelectric spark of extremely short duration in a dark room. But since,\r\nfor the full intellectual comprehension of a picture presented to the\r\neye, a certain, not inconsiderable interval of time is necessary, the\r\nmethod of instantaneous photography will naturally also be employed. The\r\npictures, which are of extremely minute duration, are thus permanently\r\nrecorded and can be examined and analysed at one's convenience and\r\nleisure.\r\n\r\nWith the difficulty just mentioned is associated still another and\r\ngreater difficulty which is due to the air. The atmosphere in its usual\r\ncondition is generally not visible even when at rest. But the task\r\npresented to us is to render visible masses of air which in addition\r\nare moving with a high velocity.\r\n\r\nTo be visible, a body must either emit light itself, must shine, or must\r\naffect in some way the light which falls upon it, must take up that\r\nlight entirely or partly, absorb it, or must have a deflective effect\r\nupon it, that is, reflect or refract it. We cannot see the air as we can\r\na flame, for it shines only exceptionally, as in a Geissler's tube. The\r\natmosphere is extremely transparent and colorless; it cannot be seen,\r\ntherefore, as a dark or colored body can, or as chlorine gas can, or\r\nvapor of bromine or iodine. Air, finally, has so small an index of\r\nrefraction and so small a deflective influence upon light, that the\r\nrefractive effect is commonly imperceptible altogether.\r\n\r\nA glass rod is visible in air or in water, but it is almost invisible in\r\na mixture of benzol and bisulphuret of carbon, which has the same mean\r\nindex of refraction as the glass. Powdered glass in the same mixture has\r\na vivid coloring, because owing to the decomposition of the colors the\r\nindices are the same for only one color which traverses the mixture\r\nunimpeded, whilst the other colors undergo repeated reflexions.[111]\r\n\r\nWater is invisible in water, alcohol in alcohol. But if alcohol be mixed\r\nwith water the flocculent streaks of the alcohol in the water will be\r\nseen at once and _vice versa_. And in like manner the air, too, under\r\nfavorable circumstances, may be seen. Over a roof heated by the burning\r\nsun, a tremulous wavering of objects is noticeable, as there is also\r\nover red-hot stoves, radiators, and registers. In all these cases tiny\r\nflocculent masses of hot and cold air, of slightly differing\r\nrefrangibility, are mingled together.\r\n\r\nIn like manner the more highly refracting parts of non-homogeneous\r\nmasses of glass, the so-called striæ or imperfections of the glass, are\r\nreadily detectible among the less refracting parts which constitute the\r\nbulk of the same. Such glasses are unserviceable for optical purposes,\r\nand special attention has been devoted to the investigation of the\r\nmethods for eliminating or avoiding these defects. The result has been\r\nthe development of an extremely delicate method for detecting optical\r\nfaults--the so-called method of Foucault and Toepler--which is suitable\r\nalso for our present purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49.]\r\n\r\nEven Huygens when trying to detect the presence of striæ in polished\r\nglasses viewed them under oblique illumination, usually at a\r\nconsiderable distance, so as to give full scope to the aberrations, and\r\nhad recourse for greater exactitude to a telescope. But the method was\r\ncarried to its highest pitch of perfection in 1867 by Toepler who\r\nemployed the following procedure: A small luminous source _a_ (Fig. 49)\r\nilluminates a lens _L_ which throws an image _b_ of the luminous source.\r\nIf the eye be so placed that the image falls on the pupil, the entire\r\nlens, if perfect, will appear equally illuminated, for the reason that\r\nall points of it send out rays to the eye. Coarse imperfections of form\r\nor of homogeneity are rendered visible only in case the aberrations are\r\nso large that the light from many spots passes by the pupil of the eye.\r\nBut if the image _b_ be partly intercepted by the edge of a small slide,\r\nthen those spots in the lens as thus partly darkened will appear\r\nbrighter whose light by its greater aberrations still reaches the eye in\r\nspite of the intercepting slide, while those spots will appear darker\r\nwhich in consequence of aberration in the other direction throw their\r\nlight entirely upon the slide. This artifice of the intercepting slide\r\nwhich had previously been employed by Foucault for the investigation of\r\nthe optical imperfections of mirrors enhances enormously the delicacy of\r\nthe method, which is still further augmented by Toepler's employment of\r\na telescope behind the slide. Toepler's method, accordingly, enjoys all\r\nthe advantages of the Huygens and the Foucault procedure combined. It is\r\nso delicate that the minutest irregularities in the air surrounding the\r\nlens can be rendered distinctly visible, as I shall show by an example.\r\nI place a candle before the lens _L_ (Fig. 50) and so arrange a second\r\nlens _M_ that the flame of the candle is imaged upon the screen _S_. As\r\nsoon as the intercepting slide is pushed into the focus, _b_, of the\r\nlight issuing from _a_, you see the images of the changes of density and\r\nthe images of the movements induced in the air by the flame quite\r\ndistinctly upon the screen. The distinctness of the phenomenon as a\r\nwhole depends upon the position of the intercepting slide _b_. The\r\nremoval of _b_ increases the illumination but decreases the\r\ndistinctness. If the luminous source _a_ be removed, we see the image of\r\nthe candle flame only upon the screen _S_. If we remove the flame and\r\nallow _a_ to continue shining, the screen _S_ will appear uniformly\r\nilluminated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50.]\r\n\r\nAfter Toepler had sought long and in vain to render the irregularities\r\nproduced in air by sound-waves visible by this principle, he was at last\r\nconducted to his goal by the favorable circumstances attending the\r\nproduction of electric sparks. The waves generated in the air by\r\nelectric sparks and accompanying the explosive snapping of the same, are\r\nof sufficiently short period and sufficiently powerful to be rendered\r\nvisible by these methods. Thus we see how by a careful regard for the\r\nmerest and most shadowy indications of a phenomenon and by slight\r\nprogressive and appropriate alterations of the circumstances and the\r\nmethods, ultimately the most astounding results can be attained.\r\nConsider, for example, two such phenomena as the rubbing of amber and\r\nthe electric lighting of modern streets. A person ignorant of the myriad\r\nminute links that join these two things together, will be absolutely\r\nnonplussed at their connexion, and will comprehend it no more than the\r\nordinary observer who is unacquainted with embryology, anatomy, and\r\npaleontology will understand the connexion between a saurian and a bird.\r\nThe high value and significance of the co-operation of inquirers through\r\ncenturies, where each has but to take up the thread of work of his\r\npredecessors and spin it onwards, is rendered forcibly evident by such\r\nexamples. And such knowledge destroys, too, in the clearest manner\r\nimaginable that impression of the marvellous which the spectator may\r\nreceive from science, and at the same time is a most salutary\r\nadmonishment to the worker in science against superciliousness. I have\r\nalso to add the sobering remark that all our art would be in vain did\r\nnot nature herself afford at least some slight guiding threads leading\r\nfrom a hidden phenomenon into the domain of the observable. And so it\r\nneed not surprise us that once under particularly favorable\r\ncircumstances an extremely powerful sound-wave which had been caused by\r\nthe explosion of several hundred pounds of dynamite threw a directly\r\nvisible shadow in the sunlight, as Boys has recently told us. If the\r\nsound-waves were absolutely without influence upon the light, this could\r\nnot have occurred, and all our artifices would then, too, be in vain.\r\nAnd so, similarly, the phenomenon accompanying projectiles which I am\r\nabout to show you was once in a very imperfect manner incidentally seen\r\nby a French artillerist, Journée, while that observer was simply\r\nfollowing the line of flight of a projectile with a telescope, just as\r\nalso the undulations produced by candle flames are in a weak degree\r\ndirectly visible and in the bright sunlight are imaged in shadowy waves\r\nupon a uniform white background.\r\n\r\n_Instantaneous illumination_ by the electric spark, the method of\r\nrendering visible small optical differences or striæ, which may hence be\r\ncalled the _striate_, or _differential_, method,[112] invented by\r\nFoucault and Toepler, and finally the _recording_ of the image by a\r\n_photographic_ plate,--these therefore are the chief means which are to\r\nlead us to our goal.\r\n\r\nI instituted my first experiments in the summer of 1884 with a\r\ntarget-pistol, shooting the bullet through a striate field as described\r\nabove, and taking care that the projectile whilst in the field should\r\ndisengage an illuminating electric spark from a Leyden jar or Franklin's\r\npane, which spark produced a photographic impression of the projectile\r\nupon a plate, especially arranged for the purpose. I obtained the image\r\nof the projectile at once and without difficulty. I also readily\r\nobtained, with the still rather defective dry plate which I was using,\r\nexceedingly delicate images of the sound-waves (spark-waves). But no\r\natmospheric condensation produced by the projectile was visible. I now\r\ndetermined the velocity of my projectile and found it to be only 240\r\nmetres per second, or considerably less than the velocity of sound\r\n(which is 340 metres per second). I saw immediately that under such\r\ncircumstances no noticeable compression of the air could be produced,\r\nfor any atmospheric compression must of necessity travel forward at the\r\nsame speed with sound (340 metres per second) and consequently would be\r\nalways ahead of and speeding away from the projectile.\r\n\r\nI was so thoroughly convinced, however, of the existence of the supposed\r\nphenomenon at a velocity exceeding 340 metres per second, that I\r\nrequested Professor Salcher, of Fiume, an Austrian port on the Gulf of\r\nQuarnero, to undertake the experiment with projectiles travelling at a\r\nhigh rate of speed. In the summer of 1886 Salcher in conjunction with\r\nProfessor Riegler conducted in a spacious and suitable apartment placed\r\nat their disposal by the Directors of the Royal Imperial Naval Academy,\r\nexperiments of the kind indicated and conforming in method exactly to\r\nthose which I had instituted, with the precise results expected. The\r\nphenomenon, in fact, accorded perfectly with the _a priori_ sketch of it\r\nwhich I had drafted previously to the experiment. As the experimenting\r\nwas continued, new and unforeseen features made their appearance.\r\n\r\nIt would be unfair, of course, to expect from the very first experiments\r\nfaultless and highly distinct photographs. It was sufficient that\r\nsuccess was secured and that I had convinced myself that further labor\r\nand expenditure would not be vain. And on this score I am greatly\r\nindebted to the two gentlemen above mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe Austrian Naval Department subsequently placed a cannon at Salcher's\r\ndisposal in Pola, an Adriatic seaport, and I myself, together with my\r\nson, then a student of medicine, having received and accepted a\r\ncourteous invitation from Krupp, repaired to Meppen, a town in Hanover,\r\nwhere we conducted with only the necessary apparatus several experiments\r\non the open artillery range. All these experiments furnished tolerably\r\ngood and complete pictures. Some little progress, too, was made. The\r\noutcome of our experience on both artillery ranges, however, was the\r\nsettled conviction that really good results could be obtained only by\r\nthe most careful conduct of the experiments in a laboratory especially\r\nadapted to the purpose. The expensiveness of the experiments on a large\r\nscale was not the determining consideration here, for the size of the\r\nprojectile is indifferent. Given the same velocity and the results are\r\nquite similar, whether the projectiles are large or small. On the other\r\nhand, in a laboratory the experimenter has perfect control over the\r\ninitial velocity, which, provided the proper equipment is at hand, can\r\nbe altered at will simply by altering the charge and the weight of the\r\nprojectile. The requisite experiments were accordingly conducted by me\r\nin my laboratory at Prague, partly in conjunction with my son and partly\r\nafterwards by him alone. The latter are the most perfect and I shall\r\naccordingly speak in detail here of these only.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51.]\r\n\r\nPicture to yourself an apparatus for detecting optical striæ set up in a\r\ndark room. In order not to make the description too complicated, I shall\r\ngive the essential features only of the apparatus, leaving out of\r\naccount altogether the minuter details which are rather of consequence\r\nfor the technical performance of the experiment than for its\r\nunderstanding. We suppose the projectile speeding on its path,\r\naccordingly, through the field of our differential optical apparatus.\r\nOn reaching the centre of the field (Fig. 51) the projectile disengages\r\nan illuminating electric spark _a_, and the image of the projectile, so\r\nproduced, is photographically impressed upon the plate of the camera\r\nbehind the intercepting slide _b_. In the last and best experiments the\r\nlens _L_ was replaced by a spherical silvered-glass mirror made by K.\r\nFritsch (formerly Prokesch) of Vienna, whereby the apparatus was\r\nnaturally more complicated than it appears in our diagram. The\r\nprojectile having been carefully aimed passes in crossing the\r\ndifferential field between two vertical isolated wires which are\r\nconnected with the two coatings of a Leyden jar, and completely filling\r\nthe space between the wires discharges the jar. In the axis of the\r\ndifferential apparatus the circuit has a second gap _a_ which furnishes\r\nthe illuminating spark, the image of which falls on the intercepting\r\nslide _b_. The wires in the differential field having occasioned\r\nmanifold disturbances were subsequently done away with. In the new\r\narrangement the projectile passes through a ring (see dotted line, Fig.\r\n51), to the air in which it imparts a sharp impulse which travels\r\nforward in the tube _r_ as a sound-wave having the approximate velocity\r\nof 340 metres per second, topples over through the aperture of an\r\nelectric screen the flame of a candle situated at the other opening of\r\nthe tube, and so discharges the jar. The length of the tube _r_ is so\r\nadjusted that the discharge occurs the moment the projectile enters the\r\ncentre of the now fully clear and free field of vision. We will also\r\nleave out of account the fact that to secure fully the success of the\r\nexperiment, a large jar is first discharged by the flame, and that by\r\nthe agency of this first discharge the discharge of a second small jar\r\nhaving a spark of very short period which furnishes the spark really\r\nilluminating the projectile is effected. Sparks from large jars have an\r\nappreciable duration, and owing to the great velocity of the projectiles\r\nfurnish blurred photographs only. By carefully husbanding the light of\r\nthe differential apparatus, and owing to the fact that much more light\r\nreaches the photographic plate in this way than would otherwise reach\r\nit, we can obtain beautiful, strong, and sharp photographs with\r\nincredibly small sparks. The contours of the pictures appear as very\r\ndelicate and very sharp, closely adjacent double lines. From their\r\ndistance from one another, and from the velocity of the projectile, the\r\nduration of the illumination, or of the spark, is found to be 1/800000\r\nof a second. It is evident, therefore, that experiments with mechanical\r\nsnap slides can furnish no results worthy of the name.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52.]\r\n\r\nLet us consider now first the picture of a projectile in the rough, as\r\nrepresented in Figure 52, and then let us examine it in its photographic\r\nform as seen in Figure 53. The latter picture is of a shot from an\r\nAustrian Mannlicher rifle. If I were not to tell you what the picture\r\nrepresented you would very likely imagine it to be a bird's eye view of\r\na boat _b_ moving swiftly through the water. In front you see the\r\nbow-wave and behind the body a phenomenon _k_ which closely resembles\r\nthe eddies formed in the wake of a ship. And as a matter of fact the\r\ndark hyperboloid arc which streams from the tip of the projectile really\r\nis a compressed wave of air exactly analogous to the bow-wave produced\r\nby a ship moving through the water, with the exception that the wave of\r\nair is not a surface-wave. The air-wave is produced in atmospheric space\r\nand encompasses the projectile in the form of a shell on all sides. The\r\nwave is visible for the same reason that the heated shell of air\r\nsurrounding the candle flame of our former experiments is visible. And\r\nthe cylinder of friction-heated air which the projectile throws off in\r\nthe form of vortex rings really does answer to the water in the wake of\r\na vessel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53. Photograph of a blunted projectile.]\r\n\r\nNow just as a slowly moving boat produces no bow-wave, but the bow-wave\r\nis seen only when the boat moves with a speed which is greater than the\r\nvelocity of propagation of surface-waves in water, so, in like manner,\r\nno wave of compression is visible in front of a projectile so long as\r\nthe speed of the projectile is less than the velocity of sound. But if\r\nthe speed of the projectile reaches and exceeds the velocity of sound,\r\nthen the head-wave, as we shall call it, augments noticeably in power,\r\nand is more and more extended, that is, the angle made by the contours\r\nof the wave with the direction of flight is more and more diminished,\r\njust as when the speed of a boat is increased a similar phenomenon is\r\nnoticed in connexion with the bow-wave. In fact, we can from an\r\ninstantaneous photograph so taken approximately estimate the speed with\r\nwhich the projectile is travelling.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of the bow-wave of a ship and that of the head-wave of a\r\nbody travelling in atmospheric space both repose upon the same\r\nprinciple, long ago employed by Huygens. Conceive a number of pebbles to\r\nbe cast into a pond of water at regular intervals in such wise that all\r\nthe spots struck are situate in the same straight line, and that every\r\nspot subsequently struck lies a short space farther to the right. The\r\nspots first struck will furnish then the wave-circles which are widest,\r\nand all of them together will, at the points where they are thickest,\r\nform a sort of cornucopia closely resembling the bow-wave. (Fig. 54.)\r\nThe resemblance is greater the smaller the pebbles are, and the more\r\nquickly they succeed each other. If a rod be dipped into the water and\r\nquickly carried along its surface, the falling of the pebbles will then\r\ntake place, so to speak, uninterruptedly, and we shall have a real\r\nbow-wave. If we put the compressed air-wave in the place of the\r\nsurface-waves of the water, we shall have the head-wave of the\r\nprojectile.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54.]\r\n\r\nYou may be disposed to say now, it is all very pretty and interesting to\r\nobserve a projectile in its flight, but of what practical use is it?\r\n\r\nIt is true, I reply, one cannot _wage war_ with photographed\r\nprojectiles. And I have likewise often had to say to medical students\r\nattending my lectures on physics, when they inquired for the practical\r\nvalue of some physical observation, \"You cannot, gentlemen, cure\r\ndiseases with it.\" I had also once to give my opinion regarding how much\r\nphysics should be taught at a school for millers, supposing the\r\ninstruction there to be confined _exactly_ to what was necessary for a\r\nmiller. I was obliged to reply: \"A miller always _needs_ exactly as much\r\nphysics as he _knows_.\" Knowledge which one does not possess one cannot\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nLet us forego entirely the consideration that as a general thing every\r\nscientific advance, every new problem elucidated, every extension or\r\nenrichment of our knowledge of facts, affords a better foundation for\r\npractical pursuits. Let us rather put the special question, Is it not\r\npossible to derive some really practical knowledge from our theoretical\r\nacquaintance with the phenomena which take place in the space\r\nsurrounding a projectile?\r\n\r\nNo physicist who has ever studied waves of sound or photographed them\r\nwill have the least doubt regarding the sound-wave character of the\r\natmospheric condensation encompassing the head of a flying projectile.\r\nWe have therefore, without ado, called this condensation the head-wave.\r\n\r\nKnowing this, it follows that the view of Melsens according to which the\r\nprojectile carries along with it masses of air which it forces into the\r\nbodies struck, is untenable. A forward-moving sound-wave is not a\r\nforward-moving mass of matter but a forward-moving form of motion, just\r\nas a water-wave or the waves of a field of wheat are only forward-moving\r\nforms of motion and not movements of masses of water or masses of wheat.\r\n\r\nBy interference-experiments, on which I cannot touch here but which will\r\nbe found roughly represented in Figure 55, it was found that the\r\nbell-shaped head-wave in question is an extremely thin shell and that\r\nthe condensations of the same are quite moderate, scarcely exceeding\r\ntwo-tenths of an atmosphere. There can be no question, therefore, of\r\nexplosive effects in the body struck by the projectile through so slight\r\na degree of atmospheric compression. The phenomena attending wounds from\r\nrifle balls, for example, are not to be explained as Melsens and Busch\r\nexplain them, but are due, as Kocher and Reger maintain, to the effects\r\nof the impact of the projectile itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55.]\r\n\r\nA simple experiment will show how insignificant is the part played by\r\nthe friction of the air, or the supposed conveyance of the air along\r\nwith the moving projectile. If the photograph of the projectile be\r\ntaken while passing through a flame, i. e., a visible gas, the flame\r\nwill be seen to be, not torn and deformed, but smoothly and cleanly\r\nperforated, like any solid body. Within and around the flame the\r\ncontours of the head-wave will be seen. The flickering, the extinction\r\nof the flame, etc., take place only after the projectile has travelled\r\non a considerable distance in its path, and is then affected by the\r\npowder gases which hurry after the bullet or by the air preceding the\r\npowder-gases.\r\n\r\nThe physicist who examines the head-wave and recognises its sound-wave\r\ncharacter also sees that the wave in question is of the same kind with\r\nthe short sharp waves produced by electric sparks, that it is a\r\n_noise_-wave. Hence, whenever any portion of the head-wave strikes the\r\near it will be heard as a report. Appearances point to the conclusion\r\nthat the projectile carries this report along with it. In addition to\r\nthis report, which advances with the velocity of the projectile and so\r\nusually travels at a speed greater than the velocity of sound, there is\r\nalso to be heard the report of the exploding powder which travels\r\nforward with the ordinary velocity of sound. Hence two explosions will\r\nbe heard, each distinct in time. The circumstance that this fact was\r\nlong misconstrued by practical observers but when actually noticed\r\nfrequently received grotesque explanations and that ultimately my view\r\nwas accepted as the correct one, appears to me in itself a sufficient\r\njustification that researches such as we are here speaking of are not\r\nutterly superfluous even in practical directions. That the flashes and\r\nsounds of discharging artillery are used for estimating the distances of\r\nbatteries is well known, and it stands to reason that any unclear\r\ntheoretical conception of the facts here involved will seriously affect\r\nthe correctness of practical calculations.\r\n\r\nIt may appear astonishing to a person hearing it for the first time,\r\nthat a single shot has a double report due to two different velocities\r\nof propagation. But the reflexion that projectiles whose velocity is\r\nless than the velocity of sound produce no head-waves (because every\r\nimpulse imparted to the air travels forward, that is, ahead, with\r\nexactly the velocity of sound), throws full light when logically\r\ndeveloped upon the peculiar circumstance above mentioned. If the\r\nprojectile moves faster than sound, the air ahead of it cannot recede\r\nfrom it quickly enough. The air is condensed and warmed, and thereupon,\r\nas all know, the velocity of sound is augmented until the head-wave\r\ntravels forward as rapidly as the projectile itself, so that there is no\r\nneed whatever of any additional augmentation of the velocity of\r\npropagation. If such a wave were left entirely to itself, it would\r\nincrease in length and soon pass into an ordinary sound-wave, travelling\r\nwith less velocity. But the projectile is always behind it and so\r\nmaintains it at its proper density and velocity. Even if the projectile\r\npenetrates a piece of cardboard or a board of wood, which catches and\r\nobstructs the head-wave, there will, as Figure 56 shows, immediately\r\nappear at the emerging apex a newly formed, not to say newly born,\r\nhead-wave. We may observe on the cardboard the reflexion and diffraction\r\nof the head-wave, and by means of a flame its refraction, so that no\r\ndoubt as to its nature can remain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56.]\r\n\r\nPermit me, now, to illustrate the most essential of the points that I\r\nhave just adduced, by means of a few rough drawings taken from older and\r\nless perfect photographs.\r\n\r\nIn the sketch of Figure 57 you see the projectile, which has just left\r\nthe barrel of the rifle, touch a wire and disengage the illuminating\r\nspark. At the apex of the projectile you already see the beginnings of\r\na powerful head-wave, and in front of the wave a transparent fungiform\r\ncluster. This latter is the air which has been forced out of the barrel\r\nby the projectile. Circular sound-waves, noise-waves, which are soon\r\novertaken by the projectile, also issue from the barrel. But behind the\r\nprojectile opaque puffs of powder-gas rush forth. It is scarcely\r\nnecessary to add that many other questions in ballistics may be studied\r\nby this method, as, for example, the movement of the gun-carriage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57.]\r\n\r\nA distinguished French artillerist, M. Gossot, has applied the views of\r\nthe head-wave here given in quite a different manner. The practice in\r\nmeasuring the velocity of projectiles is to cause the projectile to pass\r\nthrough wire screens placed at different points in its path, and by the\r\ntearing of these screens to give rise to electro-magnetic time-signals\r\non falling slabs or rotating drums. Gossot caused these signals to be\r\nmade directly by the impact of the head-wave, did away thus with the\r\nwire screens, and carried the method so far as to be able to measure the\r\nvelocities of projectiles travelling in high altitudes, where the use of\r\nwire screens was quite out of the question.\r\n\r\nThe laws of the resistance of fluids and of air to bodies travelling in\r\nthem form an extremely complicated problem, which can be reasoned out\r\nvery simply and prettily as a matter of pure philosophy but practice\r\noffers not a few difficulties. The same body having the velocity 2, 3, 4\r\n... displaces in the same interval 2, 3, 4 ... times the same mass of\r\nair, or the same mass of fluid, and imparts to it _in addition_ 2, 3, 4\r\n... times the same velocity. But for this, plainly, 4, 9, 16 ... times\r\nthe original force is required. Hence, the resistance, it is said,\r\nincreases with the square of the velocity. This is all very pretty and\r\nsimple and obvious. But practice and theory are at daggers' points here.\r\nPractice tells us that when we increase the velocity, the law of the\r\nresistance changes. For every portion of the velocity the law is\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nThe studies of the talented English naval architect, Froude, have thrown\r\nlight upon this question. Froude has shown that the resistance is\r\nconditioned by a combination of the most multifarious phenomena. A ship\r\nin motion is subjected to the friction of the water. It causes eddies\r\nand it generates in addition waves which radiate outward from it. Every\r\none of these phenomena are dependent upon the velocity in some different\r\nmanner, and it is consequently not astonishing that the law of the\r\nresistance should be a complicated one.\r\n\r\nThe preceding observations suggest quite analogous reflexions for\r\nprojectiles. Here also we have friction, the formation of eddies, and\r\nthe generation of waves. Here, also, therefore, we should not be\r\nsurprised at finding the law of the resistance of the air a complicated\r\none, nor puzzled at learning that in actuality the law of resistance\r\nchanges as soon as the speed of the projectile exceeds the velocity of\r\nsound, for this is the precise point at which one important element of\r\nthe resistance, namely, the formation of waves, first comes into play.\r\n\r\nNo one doubts that a pointed bullet pierces the air with less resistance\r\nthan a blunt bullet. The photographs themselves show that the head-wave\r\nis weaker for a pointed projectile. It is not impossible, similarly,\r\nthat forms of bullets will be invented which generate fewer eddies,\r\netc., and that we shall study these phenomena also by photography. I am\r\nof opinion from the few experiments which I have made in this direction\r\nthat not much more can be done by changing the form of the projectile\r\nwhen the velocity is very great, but I have not gone into the question\r\nthoroughly. Researches of the kind we are considering can certainly not\r\nbe detrimental to practical artillery, and it is no less certain that\r\nexperiments by artillerists on a large scale will be of undoubted\r\nbenefit to physics.\r\n\r\nNo one who has had the opportunity of studying modern guns and\r\nprojectiles in their marvellous perfection, their power and precision,\r\ncan help confessing that a high technical and scientific achievement has\r\nfound its incarnation in these objects. We may surrender ourselves so\r\ncompletely to this impression as to forget for a moment the terrible\r\npurposes they serve.\r\n\r\nPermit me, therefore, before we separate, to say a few words on this\r\nglaring contrast. The greatest man of war and of silence which the\r\npresent age has produced once asserted that perpetual peace is a dream,\r\nand not a beautiful dream at that. We may accord to this profound\r\nstudent of mankind a judgment in these matters and can also appreciate\r\nthe soldier's horror of stagnation from all too lengthy peace. But it\r\nrequires a strong belief in the insuperableness of mediæval barbarism to\r\nhope for and to expect no great improvement in international relations.\r\nThink of our forefathers and of the times when club law ruled supreme,\r\nwhen within the same country and the same state brutal assaults and\r\nequally brutal self-defence were universal and self-evident. This state\r\nof affairs grew so oppressive that finally a thousand and one\r\ncircumstances compelled people to put an end to it, and the cannon had\r\nmost to say in accomplishing the work. Yet the rule of club law was not\r\nabolished so quickly after all. It had simply passed to other clubs. We\r\nmust not abandon ourselves to dreams of the Rousseau type. Questions of\r\nlaw will in a sense forever remain questions of might. Even in the\r\nUnited States where every one is as a matter of principle entitled to\r\nthe same privileges, the ballot according to Stallo's pertinent remark\r\nis but a milder substitute for the club. Nor need I tell you that many\r\nof our own fellow-citizens are still enamored of the old original\r\nmethods. Very, very gradually, however, as civilisation progresses, the\r\nintercourse of men takes on gentler forms, and no one who really knows\r\nthe good old times will ever honestly wish them back again, however\r\nbeautifully they may be painted and rhymed about.\r\n\r\nIn the intercourse of the nations, however, the old club law still\r\nreigns supreme. But since its rule is taxing the intellectual, the\r\nmoral, and the material resources of the nations to the utmost and\r\nconstitutes scarcely less a burden in peace than in war, scarcely less a\r\nyoke for the victor than for the vanquished, it must necessarily grow\r\nmore and more unendurable. Reason, fortunately, is no longer the\r\nexclusive possession of those who modestly call themselves the upper ten\r\nthousand. Here, as everywhere, the evil itself will awaken the\r\nintellectual and ethical forces which are destined to mitigate it. Let\r\nthe hate of races and of nationalities run riot as it may, the\r\nintercourse of nations will still increase and grow more intimate. By\r\nthe side of the problems which separate nations, the great and common\r\nideals which claim the exclusive powers of the men of the future appear\r\none after another in greater distinctness and in greater might.\r\n\r\n  FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 110: A lecture delivered on Nov. 10, 1897.]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 111: Christiansen, _Wiedemann's Annalen_, XXIII.

But for centuries Latin\r\nand Greek _institutions_ exist in which our children spend a goodly\r\nportion of their days, and whose atmosphere constantly surrounds them,\r\neven when without their walls.\r\n\r\nFor centuries instruction in the ancient languages has been zealously\r\ncultivated. For centuries its necessity has been alternately championed\r\nand contested. More strongly than ever are authoritative voices now\r\nraised against the preponderance of instruction in the classics and in\r\nfavor of an education more suited to the needs of the time, especially\r\nfor a more generous treatment of mathematics and the natural sciences.\r\n\r\nIn accepting your invitation to speak here on the relative educational\r\nvalue of the classical and the mathematico-physical sciences in colleges\r\nand high schools, I find my justification in the duty and the necessity\r\nlaid upon every teacher of forming from his own experiences an opinion\r\nupon this important question, as partly also in the special circumstance\r\nthat in my youth I was personally under the influence of school-life for\r\nonly a short time, just previous to my entering the university, and had,\r\ntherefore, ample opportunity to observe the effects of widely different\r\nmethods upon my own person.\r\n\r\nPassing now, to a review of the arguments which the advocates of\r\ninstruction in the classics advance, and of what the adherents of\r\ninstruction in the physical sciences in their turn adduce, we find\r\nourselves in rather a perplexing position with respect to the arguments\r\nof the first named. For these have been different at different times,\r\nand they are even now of a very multifarious character, as must be where\r\nmen advance, in favor of an institution that exists and which they are\r\ndetermined to retain at any cost, everything they can possibly think of.\r\nWe shall find here much that has evidently been brought forward only to\r\nimpress the minds of the ignorant; much, too, that was advanced in good\r\nfaith and which is not wholly without foundation. We shall get a fair\r\nidea of the reasoning employed by considering, first, the arguments that\r\nhave grown out of the historical circumstances connected with the\r\noriginal introduction of the classics, and, lastly, those which were\r\nsubsequently adduced as accidental afterthoughts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nInstruction in Latin, as Paulsen[115] has minutely shown, was introduced\r\nby the Roman Church along with Christianity. With the Latin language\r\nwere also transmitted the scant and meagre remnants of ancient science.\r\nWhoever wished to acquire this ancient education, then the only one\r\nworthy of the name, for him the Latin language was the only and\r\nindispensable means; such a person had to learn Latin to rank among\r\neducated people.\r\n\r\nThe wide-spread influence of the Roman Church wrought many and various\r\nresults. Among those for which all are glad, we may safely count the\r\nestablishment of a sort of _uniformity_ among the nations and of a\r\nregular international intercourse by means of the Latin language, which\r\ndid much to unite the nations in the common work of civilisation,\r\ncarried on from the fifteenth to the eighteenth century. The Latin\r\nlanguage was thus long the language of scholars, and instruction in\r\nLatin the road to a liberal education--a shibboleth still employed,\r\nthough long inappropriate.\r\n\r\nFor scholars as a class, it is to be regretted, perhaps, that Latin has\r\nceased to be the medium of international communication. But the\r\nattributing of the loss of this function by the Latin language to its\r\nincapacity to accommodate itself to the numerous new ideas and\r\nconceptions which have arisen in the course of the development of\r\nscience is, in my opinion, wholly erroneous. It would be difficult to\r\nfind a modern scientist who had enriched science with as many new ideas\r\nas Newton has, yet Newton knew how to express those ideas very correctly\r\nand precisely in the Latin language. If this view were correct, it would\r\nalso hold true of every living language. Originally every language has\r\nto adapt itself to new ideas.\r\n\r\nIt is far more likely that Latin was displaced as the literary vehicle\r\nof science by the influence of the nobility. By their desire to enjoy\r\nthe fruits of literature and science, through a less irksome medium\r\nthan Latin, the nobility performed for the people at large an\r\nundeniable service. For the days were now past when acquaintance with\r\nthe language and literature of science was restricted to a caste, and in\r\nthis step, perhaps, was made the most important advance of modern times.\r\nTo-day, when international intercourse is firmly established in spite of\r\nthe many languages employed, no one would think of reintroducing\r\nLatin.[116]\r\n\r\nThe facility with which the ancient languages lend themselves to the\r\nexpression of new ideas is evidenced by the fact that the great majority\r\nof our scientific ideas, as survivals of this period of Latin\r\nintercourse, bear Latin and Greek designations, while in great measure\r\nscientific ideas are even now invested with names from these sources.\r\nBut to deduce from the existence and use of such terms the necessity of\r\nstill learning Latin and Greek on the part of all who employ them is\r\ncarrying the conclusion too far. All terms, appropriate and\r\ninappropriate,--and there are a large number of inappropriate and\r\nmonstrous combinations in science,--rest on convention. The essential\r\nthing is, that people should associate with the sign the precise idea\r\nthat is designated by it. It matters little whether a person can\r\ncorrectly derive the words _telegraph_, _tangent_, _ellipse_, _evolute_,\r\netc., if the correct idea is present in his mind when he uses them. On\r\nthe other hand, no matter how well he may know their etymology, his\r\nknowledge will be of little use to him if the correct idea is absent.\r\nAsk the average and fairly educated classical scholar to translate a few\r\nlines for you from Newton's _Principia_, or from Huygens's _Horologium_,\r\nand you will discover at once what an extremely subordinate rôle the\r\nmere knowledge of language plays in such things. Without its associated\r\nthought a word remains a mere sound. The fashion of employing Greek and\r\nLatin designations--for it can be termed nothing else--has a natural\r\nroot in history; it is impossible for the practice to disappear\r\nsuddenly, but it has fallen of late considerably into disuse. The terms\r\n_gas_, _ohm_, _Ampère_, _volt_, etc., are in international use, but they\r\nare not Latin nor Greek. Only the person who rates the unessential and\r\naccidental husk higher than its contents, can speak of the necessity of\r\nlearning Latin or Greek for such reasons, to say nothing of spending\r\neight or ten years on the task. Will not a dictionary supply in a few\r\nseconds all the information we wish on such subjects?[117]\r\n\r\nIt is indisputable that our modern civilisation took up the threads of\r\nthe ancient civilisation, that at many points it begins where the latter\r\nleft off, and that centuries ago the remains of the ancient culture were\r\nthe only culture existing in Europe. Then, of course, a classical\r\neducation really was the liberal education, the higher education, the\r\nideal education, for it was the _sole_ education. But when the same\r\nclaim is now raised in behalf of a classical education, it must be\r\nuncompromisingly contested as bereft of all foundation. For our\r\ncivilisation has gradually attained its independence; it has lifted\r\nitself far above the ancient civilisation, and has entered generally new\r\ndirections of progress. Its note, its characteristic feature, is the\r\nenlightenment that has come from the great mathematical and physical\r\nresearches of the last centuries, and which has permeated not only the\r\npractical arts and industries but is also gradually finding its way into\r\nall fields of thought, including philosophy and history, sociology and\r\nlinguistics. Those traces of ancient views that are still discoverable\r\nin philosophy, law, art, and science, operate more as hindrances than\r\nhelps, and will not long stand before the development of independent and\r\nmore natural views.\r\n\r\nIt ill becomes classical scholars, therefore, to regard themselves, at\r\nthis day, as the educated class _par excellence_, to condemn as\r\nuneducated all persons who do not understand Latin and Greek, to\r\ncomplain that with such people profitable conversations are not to be\r\ncarried on, etc. The most delectable stories have got into circulation,\r\nillustrative of the defective education of scientists and engineers. A\r\nrenowned inquirer, for example, is said to have once announced his\r\nintention of holding a free course of university lectures, with the word\r\n\"frustra\"; an engineer who spent his leisure hours in collecting insects\r\nis said to have declared that he was studying \"etymology.\" It is true,\r\nincidents of this character make us shudder or smile, according to our\r\nmood or temperament. But we must admit, the next moment, that in giving\r\nway to such feelings we have merely succumbed to a childish prejudice. A\r\nlack of tact but certainly no lack of education is displayed in the use\r\nof such half-understood expressions. Every candid person will confess\r\nthat there are many branches of knowledge about which he had better be\r\nsilent. We shall not be so uncharitable as to turn the tables and\r\ndiscuss the impression that classical scholars might make on a scientist\r\nor engineer, in speaking of science. Possibly many ludicrous stories\r\nmight be told of them, and of far more serious import, which should\r\nfully compensate for the blunders of the other party.\r\n\r\nThe mutual severity of judgment which we have here come upon, may also\r\nforcibly bring home to us how really scarce a true liberal culture is.\r\nWe may detect in this mutual attitude, too, something of that narrow,\r\nmediæval arrogance of caste, where a man began, according to the special\r\npoint of view of the speaker, with the scholar, the soldier, or the\r\nnobleman. Little sense or appreciation is to be found in it for the\r\n_common_ task of humanity, little feeling for the need of mutual\r\nassistance in the great work of civilisation, little breadth of mind,\r\nlittle truly liberal culture.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of Latin, and partly, also, a knowledge of Greek, is still a\r\nnecessity for the members of a few professions by nature more or less\r\ndirectly concerned with the civilisations of antiquity, as for lawyers,\r\ntheologians, philologists, historians, and generally for a small number\r\nof persons, among whom from time to time I count myself, who are\r\ncompelled to seek for information in the Latin literature of the\r\ncenturies just past.[118] But that all young persons in search of a\r\nhigher education should pursue for this reason Latin and Greek to such\r\nexcess; that persons intending to become physicians and scientists\r\nshould come to the universities defectively educated, or even\r\nmiseducated; and that they should be compelled to come only from schools\r\nthat do _not_ supply them with the proper preparatory knowledge is going\r\na little bit too far.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter the conditions which had given to the study of Latin and Greek\r\ntheir high import had ceased to exist, the traditional curriculum,\r\nnaturally, was retained. Then, the different effects of this method of\r\neducation, good and bad, which no one had thought of at its\r\nintroduction, were realised and noted. As natural, too, was it that\r\nthose who had strong interests in the preservation of these studies,\r\nfrom knowing no others or from living by them, or for still other\r\nreasons, should emphasise the _good_ results of such instruction. They\r\npointed to the good effects as if they had been consciously aimed at by\r\nthe method and could be attained only through its agency.\r\n\r\nOne real benefit that students might derive from a rightly conducted\r\ncourse in the classics would be the opening up of the rich literary\r\ntreasures of antiquity, and intimacy with the conceptions and views of\r\nthe world held by two advanced nations. A person who has read and\r\nunderstood the Greek and Roman authors has felt and experienced more\r\nthan one who is restricted to the impressions of the present. He sees\r\nhow men placed in different circumstances judge quite differently of the\r\nsame things from what we do to-day. His own judgments will be rendered\r\nthus more independent. Again, the Greek and Latin authors are\r\nindisputably a rich fountain of recreation, of enlightenment, and of\r\nintellectual pleasure after the day's toil, and the individual, not less\r\nthan civilised humanity generally, will remain grateful to them for all\r\ntime. Who does not recall with pleasure the wanderings of Ulysses, who\r\ndoes not listen joyfully to the simple narratives of Herodotus, who\r\nwould ever repent of having made the acquaintance of Plato's Dialogues,\r\nor of having tasted Lucian's divine humor? Who would give up the glances\r\nhe has obtained into the private life of antiquity from Cicero's\r\nletters, from Plautus or Terence? To whom are not the portraits of\r\nSuetonius undying reminiscences? Who, in fact, would throw away _any_\r\nknowledge he had once gained?\r\n\r\nYet people who draw from these sources only, who know only this culture,\r\nhave surely no right to dogmatise about the value of some other culture.\r\nAs objects of research for individuals, this literature is extremely\r\nvaluable, but it is a different question whether it is equally valuable\r\nas the almost exclusive means of education of our youth.\r\n\r\nDo not other nations and other literatures exist from which we ought to\r\nlearn? Is not nature herself our first school-mistress? Are our highest\r\nmodels always to be the Greeks, with their narrow provinciality of mind,\r\nthat divided the world into \"Greeks and barbarians,\" with their\r\nsuperstitions, with their eternal questioning of oracles? Aristotle with\r\nhis incapacity to learn from facts, with his word-science; Plato with\r\nhis heavy, interminable dialogues, with his barren, at times childish,\r\ndialectics--are they unsurpassable?[119] The Romans with their apathy,\r\ntheir pompous externality, set off by fulsome and bombastic phrases,\r\nwith their narrow-minded, philistine philosophy, with their frenzied\r\nsensuality, with their cruel and bestial indulgence in animal and man\r\nbaiting, with their outrageous maltreatment and plundering of their\r\nsubjects--are they patterns worthy of imitation? Or shall, perhaps, our\r\nscience edify itself with the works of Pliny who cites midwives as\r\nauthorities and himself stands on their point of view?\r\n\r\nBesides, if an acquaintance with the ancient world really were attained,\r\nwe might come to some settlement with the advocates of classical\r\neducation. But it is words and forms, and forms and words only, that are\r\nsupplied to our youth; and even collateral subjects are forced into the\r\nstrait-jacket of the same rigid method and made a science of words,\r\nsheer feats of mechanical memory. Really, we feel ourselves set back a\r\nthousand years into the dull cloister-cells of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nThis must be changed. It is possible to get acquainted with the views of\r\nthe Greeks and Romans by a shorter road than the intellect deadening\r\nprocess of eight or ten years of declining, conjugating, analysing, and\r\nextemporisation. There are to-day plenty of educated persons who have\r\nacquired through good translations vivider, clearer, and more just views\r\nof classical antiquity than the graduates of our gymnasiums and\r\ncolleges.[120]\r\n\r\nFor us moderns, the Greeks and the Romans are simply two objects of\r\narchæological and historical research like all others. If we put them\r\nbefore our youth in fresh and living pictures, and not merely in words\r\nand syllables, the effect will be assured. We derive a totally different\r\nenjoyment from the Greeks when we approach them after a study of the\r\nresults of modern research in the history of civilisation. We read many\r\na chapter of Herodotus differently when we attack his works equipped\r\nwith a knowledge of natural science, and with information about the\r\nstone age and the lake-dwellers. What our classical institutions\r\n_pretend_ to give can and actually will be given to our youth with much\r\nmore fruitful results by competent _historical_ instruction, which must\r\nsupply, not names and numbers alone, nor the mere history of dynasties\r\nand wars, but be in every sense of the word a true history of\r\ncivilisation.\r\n\r\nThe view still widely prevails that although all \"higher, ideal\r\nculture,\" all extension of our view of the world, is acquired by\r\nphilological and in a lesser degree by historical studies, still the\r\nmathematics and natural sciences should not be neglected on account of\r\ntheir usefulness. This is an opinion to which I must refuse my assent.\r\nIt were strange if man could learn more, could draw more intellectual\r\nnourishment, from the shards of a few old broken jugs, from inscribed\r\nstones, or yellow parchments, than from all the rest of nature. True,\r\nman is man's first concern, but he is not his sole concern.\r\n\r\nIn ceasing to regard man as the centre of the world; in discovering that\r\nthe earth is a top whirled about the sun, which speeds off with it into\r\ninfinite space; in finding that in the fixed stars the same elements\r\nexist as on earth; in meeting everywhere the same processes of which the\r\nlife of man is merely a vanishingly small part--in such things, too, is\r\na widening of our view of the world, and edification, and poetry. There\r\nare here perhaps grander and more significant facts than the bellowing\r\nof the wounded Ares, or the charming island of Calypso, or the\r\nocean-stream engirdling the earth. He only should speak of the relative\r\nvalue of these two domains of thought, of their poetry, who knows both.\r\n\r\nThe \"utility\" of physical science is, in a measure, only a _collateral_\r\nproduct of that flight of the intellect which produced science. No one,\r\nhowever, should underrate the utility of science who has shared in the\r\nrealisation by modern industrial art of the Oriental world of fables,\r\nmuch less one upon whom those treasures have been poured, as it were,\r\nfrom the fourth dimension, without his aid or understanding.\r\n\r\nNor may we believe that science is useful only to the practical man. Its\r\ninfluence permeates all our affairs, our whole life; everywhere its\r\nideas are decisive. How differently does the jurist, the legislator, or\r\nthe political economist think, who knows, for example, that a square\r\nmile of the most fertile soil can support with the solar heat annually\r\nconsumed only a definite number of human beings, which no art or science\r\ncan increase. Many economical theories, which open new air-paths of\r\nprogress, air-paths in the literal sense of the word, would be made\r\nimpossible by such knowledge.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe eulogists of classical education love to emphasise the cultivation\r\nof taste which comes from employment with the ancient models. I candidly\r\nconfess that there is something absolutely revolting in this to me. To\r\nform the taste, then, our youths must sacrifice ten years of their life!\r\nLuxury takes precedence over necessity. Have the future generations, in\r\nthe face of the difficult problems, the great social questions, which\r\nthey must meet, and that with strengthened mind and heart, no more\r\nimportant duties to fulfil than these?\r\n\r\nBut let us assume that this end were desirable. Can taste be formed by\r\nrules and precepts? Do not ideals of beauty change? Is it not a\r\nstupendous absurdity to force one's self artificially to admire things\r\nwhich, with all their historical interest, with all their beauty in\r\nindividual points, are for the most part foreign to the rest of our\r\nthoughts and feelings, provided we have such of _our own_. A nation that\r\nis truly such, has its own taste and will not go to others for it. And\r\nevery individual perfect man has his own taste.[121]\r\n\r\nAnd what, after all, does this cultivation of taste consist in? In the\r\nacquisition of the personal literary style of a few select authors! What\r\nshould we think of a people that would force its youth a thousand years\r\nfrom now, by years of practice, to master the tortuous or bombastic\r\nstyle of some successful lawyer or politician of to-day? Should we not\r\njustly accuse them of a woful lack of taste?\r\n\r\nThe evil effects of this imagined cultivation of the taste find\r\nexpression often enough. The young _savant_ who regards the composition\r\nof a scientific essay as a rhetorical exercise instead of a simple and\r\nunadorned presentation of the facts and the truth, still sits\r\nunconsciously on the school-bench, and still unwittingly represents the\r\npoint of view of the Romans, by whom the elaboration of speeches was\r\nregarded as a serious scientific (!) employment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFar be it from me to underrate the value of the development of the\r\ninstinct of speech and of the increased comprehension of our own\r\nlanguage which comes from philological studies. By the study of a\r\nforeign language, especially of one which differs widely from ours, the\r\nsigns and forms of words are first clearly distinguished from the\r\nthoughts which they express. Words of the closest possible\r\ncorrespondence in different languages never coincide absolutely with the\r\nideas they stand for, but place in relief slightly different aspects of\r\nthe same thing, and by the study of language the attention is directed\r\nto these shades of difference. But it would be far from admissible to\r\ncontend that the study of Latin and Greek is the most fruitful and\r\nnatural, let alone the _only_, means of attaining this end. Any one who\r\nwill give himself the pleasure of a few hours' companionship with a\r\nChinese grammar; who will seek to make clear to himself the mode of\r\nspeech and thought of a people who never advanced as far as the analysis\r\nof articulate sounds, but stopped at the analysis of syllables, to whom\r\nour alphabetical characters, therefore, are an inexplicable puzzle, and\r\nwho express all their rich and profound thoughts by means of a few\r\nsyllables with variable emphasis and position,--such a person, perhaps,\r\nwill acquire new, and extremely elucidative ideas upon the relation of\r\nlanguage and thought. But should our children, therefore, study Chinese?\r\nCertainly not. No more, then, should they be burdened with Latin, at\r\nleast in the measure they are.\r\n\r\nIt is a beautiful achievement to reproduce a Latin thought in a modern\r\nlanguage with the maximum fidelity of meaning and expression--for the\r\n_translator_. Moreover, we shall be very grateful to the translator for\r\nhis performance. But to demand this feat of every educated man, without\r\nconsideration of the sacrifice of time and labor which it entails, is\r\nunreasonable. And for this very reason, as classical teachers admit,\r\nthat ideal is never perfectly attained, except in rare cases with\r\nscholars possessed of special talents and great industry. Without\r\nslurring, therefore, the high importance of the study of the ancient\r\nlanguages as a profession, we may yet feel sure that the instinct for\r\nspeech which is part of every liberal education can, and must, be\r\nacquired in a different way. Should we, indeed, be forever lost if the\r\nGreeks had not lived before us?\r\n\r\nThe fact is, we must carry our demands further than the representatives\r\nof classical philology. We must ask of every educated man a fair\r\nscientific conception of the nature and value of language, of the\r\nformation of language, of the alteration of the meaning of roots, of the\r\ndegeneration of fixed forms of speech to grammatical forms, in brief, of\r\nall the main results of modern comparative philology. We should judge\r\nthat this were attainable by a careful study of our mother tongue and of\r\nthe languages next allied to it, and subsequently of the more ancient\r\ntongues from which the former are derived. If any one object that this\r\nis too difficult and entails too much labor, I should advise such a\r\nperson to place side by side an English, a Dutch, a Danish, a Swedish,\r\nand a German Bible, and to compare a few lines of them; he will be\r\namazed at the multitude of suggestions that offer themselves.[122] In\r\nfact, I believe that a really progressive, fruitful, rational, and\r\ninstructive study of languages can be conducted only on this plan. Many\r\nof my audience will remember, perhaps, the bright and encouraging\r\neffect, like that of a ray of sunlight on a gloomy day, which the meagre\r\nand furtive remarks on comparative philology in Curtius's Greek grammar\r\nwrought in that barren and lifeless desert of verbal quibbles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe principal result obtained by the present method of studying the\r\nancient languages is that which comes from the student's employment with\r\ntheir complicated grammars. It consists in the sharpening of the\r\nattention and in the exercise of the judgment by the practice of\r\nsubsuming special cases under general rules, and of distinguishing\r\nbetween different cases. Obviously, the same result can be reached by\r\nmany other methods; for example, by difficult games of cards. Every\r\nscience, the mathematics and the physical sciences included, accomplish\r\nas much, if not more, in this disciplining of the judgment. In addition,\r\nthe matter treated by those sciences has a much higher intrinsic\r\ninterest for young people, and so engages spontaneously their attention;\r\nwhile on the other hand they are elucidative and useful in other\r\ndirections in which grammar can accomplish nothing.\r\n\r\nWho cares, so far as the matter of it is concerned, whether we say\r\n_hominum_ or _hominorum_ in the genitive plural, interesting as the fact\r\nmay be for the philologist? And who would dispute that the intellectual\r\nneed of causal insight is awakened not by grammar but by the natural\r\nsciences?\r\n\r\nIt is not our intention, therefore, to gainsay in the least the good\r\ninfluence which the study of Latin and Greek grammar _also_ exercises on\r\nthe sharpening of the judgment. In so far as the study of words as such\r\nmust greatly promote lucidity and accuracy of expression, in so far as\r\nLatin and Greek are not yet wholly indispensable to many branches of\r\nknowledge, we willingly concede to them a place in our schools, but\r\nwould demand that the disproportionate amount of time allotted to them,\r\nwrongly withdrawn from other useful studies, should be considerably\r\ncurtailed. That in the end Latin and Greek will not be employed as the\r\nuniversal means of education, we are fully convinced. They will be\r\nrelegated to the closet of the scholar or professional philologist, and\r\ngradually make way for the modern languages and the modern science of\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nLong ago Locke reduced to their proper limits the exaggerated notions\r\nwhich obtained of the close connexion of thought and speech, of logic\r\nand grammar, and recent investigators have established on still surer\r\nfoundations his views. How little a complicated grammar is necessary for\r\nexpressing delicate shades of thought is demonstrated by the Italians\r\nand French, who, although they have almost totally discarded the\r\ngrammatical redundancies of the Romans, are yet not surpassed by the\r\nlatter in accuracy of thought, and whose poetical, but especially whose\r\nscientific literature, as no one will dispute, can bear favorable\r\ncomparison with the Roman.\r\n\r\nReviewing again the arguments advanced in favor of the study of the\r\nancient languages, we are obliged to say that in the main and as\r\napplied to the present, they are wholly devoid of force. In so far as\r\nthe aims which this study theoretically pursues are still worthy of\r\nattainment, they appear to us as altogether too narrow, and are\r\nsurpassed in this only by the means employed. As almost the sole,\r\nindisputable result of this study we must count the increase of the\r\nstudent's skill and precision in expression. One inclined to be\r\nuncharitable might say that our gymnasiums and classical academies turn\r\nout men who can speak and write, but, unfortunately, have little to\r\nwrite or speak about. Of that broad, liberal view, of that famed\r\nuniversal culture, which the classical curriculum is supposed to yield,\r\nserious words need not be lost. This culture might, perhaps, more\r\nproperly be termed the contracted or lopsided culture.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile considering the study of languages we threw a few side glances at\r\nmathematics and the natural sciences. Let us now inquire whether these,\r\nas branches of study, cannot accomplish much that is to be attained in\r\nno other way. I shall meet with no contradiction when I say that without\r\nat least an elementary mathematical and scientific education a man\r\nremains a total stranger in the world in which he lives, a stranger in\r\nthe civilisation of the time that bears him. Whatever he meets in\r\nnature, or in the industrial world, either does not appeal to him at\r\nall, from his having neither eye nor ear for it, or it speaks to him in\r\na totally unintelligible language.\r\n\r\nA real understanding of the world and its civilisation, however, is not\r\nthe only result of the study of mathematics and the physical sciences.\r\nMuch more essential for the preparatory school is the _formal_\r\ncultivation which comes from these studies, the strengthening of the\r\nreason and the judgment, the exercise of the imagination. Mathematics,\r\nphysics, chemistry, and the so-called descriptive sciences are so much\r\nalike in this respect, that, apart from a few points, we need not\r\nseparate them in our discussion.\r\n\r\nLogical sequence and continuity of ideas, so necessary for fruitful\r\nthought, are _par excellence_ the results of mathematics; the ability to\r\nfollow facts with thoughts, that is, to observe or collect experiences,\r\nis chiefly developed by the natural sciences. Whether we notice that the\r\nsides and the angles of a triangle are connected in a definite way, that\r\nan equilateral triangle possesses certain definite properties of\r\nsymmetry, or whether we notice the deflexion of a magnetic needle by an\r\nelectric current, the dissolution of zinc in diluted sulphuric acid,\r\nwhether we remark that the wings of a butterfly are slightly colored on\r\nthe under, and the fore-wings of the moth on the upper, surface:\r\nindiscriminately here we proceed from _observations_, from individual\r\nacts of immediate intuitive knowledge. The field of observation is more\r\nrestricted and lies closer at hand in mathematics; it is more varied and\r\nbroader but more difficult to compass in the natural sciences. The\r\nessential thing, however, is for the student to learn to make\r\nobservations in all these fields. The philosophical question whether our\r\nacts of knowledge in mathematics are of a special kind is here of no\r\nimportance for us. It is true, of course, that the observation can be\r\npractised by languages also. But no one, surely, will deny, that the\r\nconcrete, living pictures presented in the fields just mentioned possess\r\ndifferent and more powerful attractions for the mind of the youth than\r\nthe abstract and hazy figures which language offers, and on which the\r\nattention is certainly not so spontaneously bestowed, nor with such good\r\nresults.[123]\r\n\r\nObservation having revealed the different properties of a given\r\ngeometrical or physical object, it is discovered that in many cases\r\nthese properties _depend_ in some way upon one another. This\r\ninterdependence of properties (say that of equal sides and equal angles\r\nat the base of a triangle, the relation of pressure to motion,) is\r\nnowhere so distinctly marked, nowhere is the necessity and permanency of\r\nthe interdependence so plainly noticeable, as in the fields mentioned.\r\nHence the continuity and logical consequence of the ideas which we\r\nacquire in those fields. The relative simplicity and perspicuity of\r\ngeometrical and physical relations supply here the conditions of natural\r\nand easy progress. Relations of equal simplicity are not met with in\r\nthe fields which the study of language opens up. Many of you, doubtless,\r\nhave often wondered at the little respect for the notions of cause and\r\neffect and their connexion that is sometimes found among professed\r\nrepresentatives of the classical studies. The explanation is probably to\r\nbe sought in the fact that the analogous relation of motive and action\r\nfamiliar to them from their studies, presents nothing like the clear\r\nsimplicity and determinateness that the relation of cause and effect\r\ndoes.\r\n\r\nThat perfect mental grasp of all possible cases, that economical order\r\nand organic union of the thoughts which comes from it, which has grown\r\nfor every one who has ever tasted it a permanent need which he seeks to\r\nsatisfy in every new province, can be developed only by employment with\r\nthe relative simplicity of mathematical and scientific investigations.\r\n\r\nWhen a set of facts comes into apparent conflict with another set of\r\nfacts, and a problem is presented, its solution consists ordinarily in a\r\nmore refined distinction or in a more extended view of the facts, as may\r\nbe aptly illustrated by Newton's solution of the problem of dispersion.\r\nWhen a new mathematical or scientific fact is _demonstrated_, or\r\n_explained_, such demonstration also rests simply upon showing the\r\nconnexion of the new fact with the facts already known; for example,\r\nthat the radius of a circle can be laid off as chord exactly six times\r\nin the circle is explained or proved by dividing the regular hexagon\r\ninscribed in the circle into equilateral triangles. That the quantity of\r\nheat developed in a second in a wire conveying an electric current is\r\nquadrupled on the doubling of the strength of the current, we explain\r\nfrom the doubling of the fall of the potential due to the doubling of\r\nthe current's intensity, as also from the doubling of the quantity\r\nflowing through, in a word, from the quadrupling of the work done. In\r\npoint of principle, explanation and direct proof do not differ much.\r\n\r\nHe who solves scientifically a geometrical, physical, or technical\r\nproblem, easily remarks that his procedure is a _methodical_ mental\r\nquest, rendered possible by the economical order of the province--a\r\nsimplified purposeful quest as contrasted with unmethodical,\r\nunscientific guess-work. The geometer, for example, who has to construct\r\na circle touching two given straight lines, casts his eye over the\r\nrelations of symmetry of the desired construction, and seeks the centre\r\nof his circle solely in the line of symmetry of the two straight lines.\r\nThe person who wants a triangle of which two angles and the sum of the\r\nsides are given, grasps in his mind the determinateness of the form of\r\nthis triangle and restricts his search for it to a certain group of\r\ntriangles of the _same form_. Under very different circumstances,\r\ntherefore, the simplicity, the intellectual perviousness, of the\r\nsubject-matter of mathematics and natural science is felt, and promotes\r\nboth the discipline and the self-confidence of the reason.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably, much more will be attained by instruction in the\r\nmathematics and the natural sciences than now is, when more natural\r\nmethods are adopted. One point of importance here is that young students\r\nshould not be spoiled by premature abstraction, but should be made\r\nacquainted with their material from living pictures of it before they\r\nare made to work with it by purely ratiocinative methods. A good stock\r\nof geometrical experience could be obtained, for example, from\r\ngeometrical drawing and from the practical construction of models. In\r\nthe place of the unfruitful method of Euclid, which is only fit for\r\nspecial, restricted uses, a broader and more conscious method must be\r\nadopted, as Hankel has pointed out.[124] Then, if, on reviewing\r\ngeometry, and after it presents no substantial difficulties, the more\r\ngeneral points of view, the principles of scientific method are placed\r\nin relief and brought to consciousness, as Von Nagel,[125] J. K.\r\nBecker,[126] Mann,[127] and others have well done, fruitful results will\r\nbe surely attained. In the same way, the subject-matter of the natural\r\nsciences should be made familiar by pictures and experiment before a\r\nprofounder and reasoned grasp of these subjects is attempted. Here the\r\nemphasis of the more general points of view is to be postponed.\r\n\r\nBefore my present audience it would be superfluous for me to contend\r\nfurther that mathematics and natural science are justified constituents\r\nof a sound education,--a claim that even philologists, after some\r\nresistance, have conceded. Here I may count upon assent when I say that\r\nmathematics and the natural sciences pursued alone as means of\r\ninstruction yield a richer education in matter and form, a more general\r\neducation, an education better adapted to the needs and spirit of the\r\ntime,--than the philological branches pursued alone would yield.\r\n\r\nBut how shall this idea be realised in the curricula of our intermediate\r\neducational institutions? It is unquestionable in my mind that the\r\nGerman _Realschulen_ and _Realgymnasien_, where the exclusive classical\r\ncourse is for the most part replaced by mathematics, science, and modern\r\nlanguages, give the _average_ man a more timely education than the\r\ngymnasium proper, although they are not yet regarded as fit preparatory\r\nschools for future theologians and professional philologists. The German\r\ngymnasiums are too one-sided. With these the first changes are to be\r\nmade; of these alone we shall speak here. Possibly a _single_\r\npreparatory school, suitably planned, might serve all purposes.\r\n\r\nShall we, then, in our gymnasiums fill out the hours of study which\r\nstand at our disposal, or are still to be wrested from the classicists,\r\nwith as great and as varied a quantity of mathematical and scientific\r\nmatter as possible? Expect no such proposition from me. No one will\r\nsuggest such a course who has himself been actively engaged in\r\nscientific thought. Thoughts can be awakened and fructified as a field\r\nis fructified by sunshine and rain. But thoughts cannot be juggled out\r\nand worried out by heaping up materials and the hours of instruction,\r\nnor by any sort of precepts: they must grow naturally of their own free\r\naccord. Furthermore, thoughts cannot be accumulated beyond a certain\r\nlimit in a single head, any more than the produce of a field can be\r\nincreased beyond certain limits.\r\n\r\nI believe that the amount of matter necessary for a useful education,\r\nsuch as should be offered to _all_ the pupils of a preparatory school,\r\nis very small. If I had the requisite influence, I should, in all\r\ncomposure, and fully convinced that I was doing what was best, first\r\ngreatly curtail in the lower classes the amount of matter in both the\r\nclassical and the scientific courses; I should cut down considerably the\r\nnumber of the school hours and the work done outside the school. I am\r\nnot with many teachers of opinion that ten hours work a day for a child\r\nis not too much. I am convinced that the mature men who offer this\r\nadvice so lightly are themselves unable to give their attention\r\nsuccessfully for as long a time to any subject that is new to them, (for\r\nexample, to elementary mathematics or physics,) and I would ask every\r\none who thinks the contrary to make the experiment upon himself.\r\nLearning and teaching are not routine office-work that can be kept up\r\nmechanically for long periods. But even such work tires in the end. If\r\nour young men are not to enter the universities with blunted and\r\nimpoverished minds, if they are not to leave in the preparatory schools\r\ntheir vital energy, which they should there gather, great changes must\r\nbe made. Waiving the injurious effects of overwork upon the body, the\r\nconsequences of it for the mind seem to me positively dreadful.\r\n\r\nI know of nothing more terrible than the poor creatures who have learned\r\ntoo much. Instead of that sound powerful judgment which would probably\r\nhave grown up if they had learned nothing, their thoughts creep timidly\r\nand hypnotically after words, principles, and formulæ, constantly by the\r\nsame paths. What they have acquired is a spider's web of thoughts too\r\nweak to furnish sure supports, but complicated enough to produce\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nBut how shall better methods of mathematical and scientific education be\r\ncombined with the decrease of the subject-matter of instruction? I\r\nthink, by abandoning systematic instruction altogether, at least in so\r\nfar as that is required of _all_ young pupils. I see no necessity\r\nwhatever that the graduates of our high schools and preparatory schools\r\nshould be little philologists, and at the same time little\r\nmathematicians, physicists, and botanists; in fact, I do not see the\r\npossibility of such a result. I see in the endeavor to attain this\r\nresult, in which every instructor seeks for his own branch a place apart\r\nfrom the others, the main mistake of our whole system. I should be\r\nsatisfied if every young student could come into living contact with\r\nand pursue to their ultimate logical consequences merely a _few_\r\nmathematical or scientific discoveries. Such instruction would be mainly\r\nand naturally associated with selections from the great scientific\r\nclassics. A few powerful and lucid ideas could thus be made to take root\r\nin the mind and receive thorough elaboration. This accomplished, our\r\nyouth would make a different showing from what they do to-day.[128]\r\n\r\nWhat need is there, for example, of burdening the head of a young\r\nstudent with all the details of botany? The student who has botanised\r\nunder the guidance of a teacher finds on all hands, not indifferent\r\nthings, but known or unknown things, by which he is stimulated, and his\r\ngain made permanent. I express here, not my own, but the opinion of a\r\nfriend, a practical teacher. Again, it is not at all necessary that all\r\nthe matter that is offered in the schools should be learned. The best\r\nthat we have learned, that which has remained with us for life, outlived\r\nthe test of examination. How can the mind thrive when matter is heaped\r\non matter, and new materials piled constantly on old, undigested\r\nmaterials? The question here is not so much that of the accumulation of\r\npositive knowledge as of intellectual discipline. It seems also\r\nunnecessary that _all_ branches should be treated at school, and that\r\nexactly the same studies should be pursued in all schools. A single\r\nphilological, a single historical, a single mathematical, a single\r\nscientific branch, pursued as common subjects of instruction for all\r\npupils, are sufficient to accomplish all that is necessary for the\r\nintellectual development. On the other hand, a wholesome mutual stimulus\r\nwould be produced by this greater variety in the positive culture of\r\nmen. Uniforms are excellent for soldiers, but they will not fit heads.\r\nCharles V. learned this, and it should never be forgotten. On the\r\ncontrary, teachers and pupils both need considerable latitude, if they\r\nare to yield good results.\r\n\r\nWith John Karl Becker I am of the opinion that the utility and amount\r\nfor individuals of every study should be precisely determined. All that\r\nexceeds this amount should be unconditionally banished from the lower\r\nclasses. With respect to mathematics, Becker,[129] in my judgment, has\r\nadmirably solved this question.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the upper classes the demand assumes a different form.\r\nHere also the amount of matter obligatory on all pupils ought not to\r\nexceed a certain limit. But in the great mass of knowledge that a young\r\nman must acquire to-day for his profession it is no longer just that ten\r\nyears of his youth should be wasted with mere preludes. The upper\r\nclasses should supply a truly useful preparation for the professions,\r\nand should not be modelled upon the wants merely of future lawyers,\r\nministers, and philologists. Again, it would be both foolish and\r\nimpossible to attempt to prepare the same person properly for all the\r\ndifferent professions. In such case the function of the schools would\r\nbe, as Lichtenberg feared, simply to select the persons best fitted for\r\nbeing drilled, whilst precisely the finest special talents, which do not\r\nsubmit to indiscriminate discipline, would be excluded from the contest.\r\nHence, a certain amount of liberty in the choice of studies must be\r\nintroduced in the upper classes, by means of which it will be free for\r\nevery one who is clear about the choice of his profession to devote his\r\nchief attention either to the study of the philologico-historical or to\r\nthat of the mathematico-scientific branches. Then the matter now treated\r\ncould be retained, and in some branches, perhaps, judiciously\r\nextended,[130] without burdening the scholar with many branches or\r\nincreasing the number of the hours of study. With more homogeneous work\r\nthe student's capacity for work increases, one part of his labor\r\nsupporting the other instead of obstructing it. If, however, a young man\r\nshould subsequently choose a different profession, then it is _his_\r\nbusiness to make up what he has lost. No harm certainly will come to\r\nsociety from this change, nor could it be regarded as a misfortune if\r\nphilologists and lawyers with mathematical educations or physical\r\nscientists with classical educations should now and then appear.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe view is now wide-spread that a Latin and Greek education no longer\r\nmeets the general wants of the times, that a more opportune, a more\r\n\"liberal\" education exists. The phrase, \"a liberal education,\" has been\r\ngreatly misused. A truly liberal education is unquestionably very rare.\r\nThe _schools_ can hardly offer such; at best they can only bring home to\r\nthe student the necessity of it. It is, then, his business to acquire,\r\nas best he can, a more or less liberal education. It would be very\r\ndifficult, too, at any one time to give a definition of a \"liberal\"\r\neducation which would satisfy every one, still more difficult to give\r\none which would hold good for a hundred years. The educational ideal, in\r\nfact, varies much. To one, a knowledge of classical antiquity appears\r\nnot too dearly bought \"with early death.\" We have no objection to this\r\nperson, or to those who think like him, pursuing their ideal after their\r\nown fashion. But we may certainly protest strongly against the\r\nrealisation of such ideals on our own children. Another,--Plato, for\r\nexample,--puts men ignorant of geometry on a level with animals.[131]\r\nIf such narrow views had the magical powers of the sorceress Circe, many\r\na man who perhaps justly thought himself well educated would become\r\nconscious of a not very flattering transformation of himself. Let us\r\nseek, therefore, in our educational system to meet the wants of the\r\npresent, and not establish prejudices for the future.\r\n\r\nBut how does it come, we must ask, that institutions so antiquated as\r\nthe German gymnasiums could subsist so long in opposition to public\r\nopinion? The answer is simple. The schools were first organised by the\r\nChurch; since the Reformation they have been in the hands of the State.\r\nOn so large a scale, the plan presents many advantages. Means can be\r\nplaced at the disposal of education such as no private source, at least\r\nin Europe, could furnish. Work can be conducted upon the same plan in\r\nmany schools, and so experiments made of extensive scope which would be\r\notherwise impossible. A single man with influence and ideas can under\r\nsuch circumstances do great things for the promotion of education.\r\n\r\nBut the matter has also its reverse aspect. The party in power works for\r\nits own interests, uses the schools for its special purposes.\r\nEducational competition is excluded, for all successful attempts at\r\nimprovement are impossible unless undertaken or permitted by the State.\r\nBy the uniformity of the people's education, a prejudice once in vogue\r\nis permanently established. The highest intelligences, the strongest\r\nwills cannot overthrow it suddenly. In fact, as everything is adapted to\r\nthe view in question, a sudden change would be physically impossible.\r\nThe two classes which virtually hold the reins of power in the State,\r\nthe jurists and theologians, know only the one-sided, predominantly\r\nclassical culture which they have acquired in the State schools, and\r\nwould have this culture alone valued. Others accept this opinion from\r\ncredulity; others, underestimating their true worth for society, bow\r\nbefore the power of the prevalent opinion; others, again, affect the\r\nopinion of the ruling classes even against their better judgment, so as\r\nto abide on the same plane of respect with the latter. I will make no\r\ncharges, but I must confess that the deportment of medical men with\r\nrespect to the question of the qualification of graduates of your\r\n_Realschulen_ has frequently made that impression upon me. Let us\r\nremember, finally, that an influential statesman, even within the\r\nboundaries which the law and public opinion set him, can do serious harm\r\nto the cause of education by considering his own one-sided views\r\ninfallible, and in enforcing them recklessly and inconsiderately--which\r\nnot only _can_ happen, but has, repeatedly, happened.[132] The monopoly\r\nof education by the State[133] thus assumes in our eyes a somewhat\r\ndifferent aspect. And to revert to the question above asked, there is\r\nnot the slightest doubt that the German gymnasiums in their present\r\nform would have ceased to exist long ago if the State had not supported\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAll this must be changed. But the change will not be made of itself, nor\r\nwithout our energetic interference, and it will be made slowly. But the\r\npath is marked out for us, the will of the people must acquire and exert\r\nupon our school legislation a greater and more powerful influence.\r\nFurthermore, the questions at issue must be publicly and candidly\r\ndiscussed that the views of the people may be clarified. All who feel\r\nthe insufficiency of the existing _régime_ must combine into a powerful\r\norganisation that their views may acquire impressiveness and the\r\nopinions of the individual not die away unheard.\r\n\r\nI recently read, gentlemen, in an excellent book of travels, that the\r\nChinese speak with unwillingness of politics. Conversations of this sort\r\nare usually cut short with the remark that they may bother about such\r\nthings whose business it is and who are paid for it. Now it seems to me\r\nthat it is not only the business of the State, but a very serious\r\nconcern of all of us, how our children shall be educated in the public\r\nschools at _our_ cost.\r\n\r\n  FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 113: An address delivered before the Congress of Delegates\r\n  of the German Realschulmännerverein, at Dortmund, April 16, 1886.\r\n  The full title of the address reads: \"On the Relative Educational\r\n  Value of the Classics and the Mathematico-Physical Sciences in\r\n  Colleges and High Schools.\"\r\n\r\n  Although substantially contained in an address which I was to have\r\n  made at the meeting of Natural Scientists at Salzburg in 1881\r\n  (deferred on account of the Paris Exposition), and in the\r\n  Introduction to a course of lectures on \"Physical Instruction in\r\n  Preparatory Schools,\" which I delivered in 1883, the invitation of\r\n  the German Realschulmännerverein afforded me the first opportunity\r\n  of putting my views upon this subject before a large circle of\r\n  readers. Owing to the place and circumstances of delivery, my\r\n  remarks apply of course, primarily, only to German schools, but,\r\n  with slight modifications, made in this translation, are not without\r\n  force for the institutions of other countries. In giving here\r\n  expression to a strong personal conviction formed long ago, it is a\r\n  matter of deep satisfaction to me to find that they agree in many\r\n  points with the views recently advanced in independent form by\r\n  Paulsen (_Geschichte des gelehrten Unterrichts_, Leipsic, 1885) and\r\n  Frary (_La question du latin_, Paris, Cerf, 1885). It is not my\r\n  desire nor effort here to say much that is new, but merely to\r\n  contribute my mite towards bringing about the inevitable revolution\r\n  now preparing in the world of elementary instruction. In the opinion\r\n  of experienced educationists the first result of that revolution\r\n  will be to make Greek and mathematics alternately optional subjects\r\n  in the higher classes of the German Gymnasium and in the\r\n  corresponding institutions of other countries, as has been done in\r\n  the splendid system of instruction in Denmark. The gap between the\r\n  German classical Gymnasium and the German Realgymnasium, or between\r\n  classical and scientific schools generally, can thus be bridged\r\n  over, and the remaining inevitable transformations will then be\r\n  accomplished in relative peace and quiet.

Did it not require the almost incredible industry\r\n  of the Grimms and other Teutonic philologists to throw the merest\r\n  glimmerings of light upon the origin and growth of our own\r\n  mother-tongue? Besides, do not thousands of people of so-called\r\n  classical education use every moment hosts of words of foreign\r\n  origin whose derivation they do not know? Very few of them think it\r\n  worth while to look up such words in the dictionaries, although they\r\n  love to maintain that people should study the ancient languages for\r\n  the sake of etymology alone.\"]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 118: Standing remote from the legal profession I should\r\n  not have ventured to declare that the study of Greek was not\r\n  necessary for the jurists; yet this view was taken in the debate\r\n  that followed this lecture by professional jurists of high standing.\r\n  According to this opinion, the preparatory education obtained in the\r\n  German Realgymnasium would also be sufficient for the future jurists\r\n  and insufficient only for theologians and philologists.

Their importance must not be measured by the fact that our\r\n  speculative philosophy still moves to a great extent in their paths\r\n  of thought. The more probable conclusion is that this branch has\r\n  made very little progress in the last two thousand years. Natural\r\n  science also was implicated for centuries in the meshes of the\r\n  Aristotelian thought, and owes its rise mainly to having thrown off\r\n  those fetters.]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 120: I would not for a moment contend that we derive\r\n  exactly the same profit from reading a Greek author in a translation\r\n  as from reading him in the original; but the difference, the excess\r\n  of gain in the second case, appears to me, and probably will to most\r\n  men who are not professional philologists, to be too dearly bought\r\n  with the expenditure of eight years of valuable time.]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 121: \"The temptation,\" Judge Hartwich writes, \"to regard\r\n  the 'taste' of the ancients as so lofty and unsurpassable appears to\r\n  me to have its chief origin in the fact that the ancients were\r\n  unexcelled in the representation of the nude. First, by their\r\n  unremitting care of the human body they produced splendid models;\r\n  and secondly, in their gymnasiums and in their athletic games they\r\n  had these models constantly before their eyes. No wonder, then, that\r\n  their statues still excite our admiration! For the form, the ideal\r\n  of the human body has not changed in the course of the centuries.\r\n  But with intellectual matters it is totally different; they change\r\n  from century to century, nay, from decennium to decennium. It is\r\n  very natural now, that people should unconsciously apply what is\r\n  thus so easily seen, namely, the works of sculpture, as a universal\r\n  criterion of the highly developed taste of the ancients--a fallacy\r\n  against which people cannot, in my judgment, be too strongly\r\n  warned.\"]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 122: English: \"In the beginning God created the heaven and\r\n  the earth.

It is astonishing how extraordinarily near Sauveur was to the\r\nview which Helmholtz was the first to adopt in its full extent a hundred\r\nand fifty years later.\r\n\r\nThe _Histoire de l'Académie_ for 1700, p. 131, tells us that Sauveur had\r\nsucceeded in making music an object of scientific research, and that he\r\nhad invested the new science with the name of \"acoustics.\" On five\r\nsuccessive pages a number of discoveries are recorded which are more\r\nfully discussed in the volume for the year following.\r\n\r\nSauveur regards the _simplicity_ of the ratios obtaining between the\r\nrates of vibration of consonances as something universally known.[135]\r\nHe is in hope, by further research, of determining the chief rules of\r\nmusical composition and of fathoming the \"metaphysics of the agreeable,\"\r\nthe main law of which he asserts to be the union of \"simplicity with\r\nmultiplicity.\" Precisely as Euler[136] did a number of years later, he\r\nregards a consonance as more perfect according as the ratio of its\r\nvibrational rates is expressed in smaller whole numbers, because the\r\nsmaller these whole numbers are the oftener the vibrations of the two\r\ntones coincide, and hence the more readily they are apprehended. As the\r\nlimit of consonance, he takes the ratio 5:6, although he does not\r\nconceal the fact that practice, sharpened attention, habit, taste, and\r\neven prejudice play collateral rôles in the matter, and that\r\nconsequently the question is not a purely scientific one.\r\n\r\nSauveur's ideas took their development from his having instituted at\r\nall points more exact quantitative investigations than his predecessors.\r\nHe is first desirous of determining as the foundation of musical tuning\r\na fixed note of one hundred vibrations which can be reproduced at any\r\ntime; the fixing of the notes of musical instruments by the common\r\ntuning pipes then in use with rates of vibration unknown, appearing to\r\nhim inadequate. According to Mersenne (_Harmonie Universelle_, 1636), a\r\ngiven cord seventeen feet long and weighted with eight pounds executes\r\neight visible vibrations in a second. By diminishing its length then in\r\na given proportion we obtain a proportionately augmented rate of\r\nvibration. But this procedure appears too uncertain to Sauveur, and he\r\nemploys for his purpose the beats (_battemens_), which were known to the\r\norgan-makers of his day, and which he correctly explains as due to the\r\nalternate coincidence and non-coincidence of the same vibrational phases\r\nof differently pitched notes.[137] At every coincidence there is a\r\nswelling of the sound, and hence the number of beats per second will be\r\nequal to the difference of the rates of vibration. If we tune two of\r\nthree organ-pipes to the remaining one in the ratio of the minor and\r\nmajor third, the mutual ratio of the rates of vibration of the first two\r\nwill be as 24: 25, that is to say, for every 24 vibrations to the lower\r\nnote there will be 25 to the higher, and one beat. If the two pipes give\r\ntogether four beats in a second, then the higher has the fixed tone of\r\n100 vibrations. The open pipe in question will consequently be five feet\r\nin length. We also determine by this procedure the absolute rates of\r\nvibration of all the other notes.\r\n\r\nIt follows at once that a pipe eight times as long or 40 feet in length\r\nwill yield a vibrational rate of 12½, which Sauveur ascribes to the\r\nlowest audible tone, and further also that a pipe 64 times as small will\r\nexecute 6,400 vibrations, which Sauveur took for the highest audible\r\nlimit. The author's delight at his successful enumeration of the\r\n\"imperceptible vibrations\" is unmistakably asserted here, and it is\r\njustified when we reflect that to-day even Sauveur's principle, slightly\r\nmodified, constitutes the simplest and most delicate means we have for\r\nexactly determining rates of vibration. Far more important still,\r\nhowever, is a second observation which Sauveur made while studying\r\nbeats, and to which we shall revert later.\r\n\r\nStrings whose lengths can be altered by movable bridges are much easier\r\nto handle than pipes in such investigations, and it was natural that\r\nSauveur should soon resort to their use.\r\n\r\nOne of his bridges accidentally not having been brought into full and\r\nhard contact with the string, and consequently only imperfectly impeding\r\nthe vibrations, Sauveur discovered the harmonic overtones of the string,\r\nat first by the unaided ear, and concluded from this fact that the\r\nstring was divided into aliquot parts. The string when plucked, and\r\nwhen the bridge stood at the third division for example, yielded the\r\ntwelfth of its fundamental note. At the suggestion of some\r\nacademician[138] probably, variously colored paper riders were placed at\r\nthe nodes (_noeuds_) and ventral segments (_ventres_), and the division\r\nof the string due to the excitation of the overtones (_sons\r\nharmoniques_) belonging to its fundamental note (_son fondamental_) thus\r\nrendered visible. For the clumsy bridge the more convenient feather or\r\nbrush was soon substituted. . While engaged in these investigations\r\nSauveur also observed the sympathetic vibration of a string induced by\r\nthe excitation of a second one in unison with it. He also discovered\r\nthat the overtone of a string can respond to another string tuned to its\r\nnote. He even went further and discovered that on exciting one string\r\nthe overtone which it has in common with another, differently pitched\r\nstring can be produced on that other; for example, on strings having for\r\ntheir vibrational ratio 3:4, the fourth of the lower and the third of\r\nthe higher may be made to respond. It follows indisputably from this\r\nthat the excited string yields overtones simultaneously with its\r\nfundamental tone. Previously to this Sauveur's attention had been drawn\r\nby other observers to the fact that the overtones of musical instruments\r\ncan be picked out by attentive listening, particularly in the\r\nnight.[139] He himself mentions the simultaneous sounding of the\r\novertones and the fundamental tone.[140] That he did not give the proper\r\nconsideration to this circumstance was, as will afterwards be seen,\r\nfatal to his theory.\r\n\r\nWhile studying beats Sauveur makes the remark that they are\r\n_displeasing_ to the ear. He held the beats were distinctly audible only\r\nwhen less than six occurred in a second. Larger numbers were not\r\ndistinctly perceptible and gave rise accordingly to no disturbance. He\r\nthen attempts to reduce the difference between consonance and dissonance\r\nto a question of beats. Let us hear his own words.[141]\r\n\r\n     \"Beats are unpleasing to the ear because of the unevenness of the\r\n     sound, and it may be held with much plausibility that the reason\r\n     why octaves are so pleasing is that we never hear their beats.[142]\r\n\r\n     \"In following out this idea, we find that the chords whose beats we\r\n     cannot hear are precisely those which the musicians call\r\n     consonances and that those whose beats are heard are the\r\n     dissonances, and that when a chord is a dissonance in one octave\r\n     and a consonance in another, it beats in the one and does not beat\r\n     in the other. Consequently it is called an imperfect consonance. It\r\n     is very easy by the principles of M. Sauveur, here established, to\r\n     ascertain what chords beat and in what octaves, above or below the\r\n     fixed note. If this hypothesis be correct, it will disclose the\r\n     true source of the rules of composition, hitherto unknown to\r\n     science, and given over almost entirely to judgment by the ear.\r\n     These sorts of natural judgment, marvellous though they may\r\n     sometimes appear, are not so but have very real causes, the\r\n     knowledge of which belongs to science, provided it can gain\r\n     possession thereof.\"[143]\r\n\r\nSauveur thus correctly discerns in beats the cause of the disturbance\r\nof consonance, to which all disharmony is \"probably\" to be referred. It\r\nwill be seen, however, that according to his view all distant intervals\r\nmust necessarily be consonances and all near intervals dissonances. He\r\nalso overlooks the absolute difference in point of principle between his\r\nold view, mentioned at the outset, and his new view, rather attempting\r\nto obliterate it.\r\n\r\nR. Smith[144] takes note of the theory of Sauveur and calls attention to\r\nthe first of the above-mentioned defects. Being himself essentially\r\ninvolved in the old view of Sauveur, which is usually attributed to\r\nEuler, he yet approaches in his criticism a brief step nearer to the\r\nmodern theory, as appears from the following passage.[145]\r\n\r\n     \"The truth is, this gentleman confounds the distinction between\r\n     perfect and imperfect consonances, by comparing imperfect\r\n     consonances which beat because the succession of their short\r\n     cycles[146] is periodically confused and interrupted, with perfect\r\n     ones which cannot beat, because the succession of their short\r\n     cycles is never confused nor interrupted.\r\n\r\n     \"The _fluttering roughness_ above mentioned is perceivable in all\r\n     other perfect consonances, in a smaller degree in proportion as\r\n     their cycles are shorter and simpler, and their pitch is higher;\r\n     and is of a _different kind_ from the _smoother beats_ and\r\n     undulations of _tempered consonances_; because we can alter the\r\n     rate of the latter by altering the temperament, but not of the\r\n     former, the consonance being perfect at a given pitch: And because\r\n     a judicious ear can often hear, at the same time, both the\r\n     flutterings and the beats of a tempered consonance; sufficiently\r\n     distinct from each other.\r\n\r\n     \"For nothing gives greater offence to the hearer, though ignorant\r\n     of the cause of it, than those rapid, piercing beats of high and\r\n     loud sounds, which make imperfect consonances with one another. And\r\n     yet a few slow beats, like the slow undulations of a close shake\r\n     now and then introduced, are far from being disagreeable.\"\r\n\r\nSmith is accordingly clear that other \"roughnesses\" exist besides the\r\nbeats which Sauveur considered, and if the investigations had been\r\ncontinued on the basis of Sauveur's idea, these additional roughnesses\r\nwould have turned out to be the beats of the overtones, and the theory\r\nthus have attained the point of view of Helmholtz.\r\n\r\nReviewing the differences between Sauveur's and Helmholtz's theories, we\r\nfind the following:\r\n\r\n1. The theory according to which consonance depends on the frequent and\r\nregular coincidence of vibrations and their ease of enumeration, appears\r\nfrom the new point of view inadmissible. The simplicity of the ratios\r\nobtaining between the rates of vibration is indeed a _mathematical_\r\ncharacteristic of consonance as well as a _physical_ condition thereof,\r\nfor the reason that the coincidence of the overtones as also their\r\nfurther physical and physiological consequences is connected with this\r\nfact. But no _physiological_ or _psychological_ explanation of\r\nconsonance is given by this fact, for the simple reason that in the\r\nacoustic nerve-process nothing corresponding to the periodicity of the\r\nsonant stimulus is discoverable.\r\n\r\n2. In the recognition of beats as a disturbance of consonance, both\r\ntheories agree. Sauveur's theory, however, does not take into account\r\nthe fact that clangs, or musical sounds generally, are composite and\r\nthat the disturbance in the consonances of distant intervals principally\r\narise from the beats of the overtones. Furthermore, Sauveur was wrong in\r\nasserting that the number of beats must be less than six in a second in\r\norder to produce disturbances. Even Smith knows that very slow beats are\r\nnot a cause of disturbance, and Helmholtz found a much higher number\r\n(33) for the maximum of disturbance. Finally, Sauveur did not consider\r\nthat although the number of beats increases with the recession from\r\nunison, yet their _strength_ is diminished. On the basis of the\r\nprinciple of specific energies and of the laws of sympathetic vibration\r\nthe new theory finds that two atmospheric motions of like amplitude but\r\ndifferent periods, _a_ sin(_rt_) and _a_ sin[(_r_ + [rho])(_t_ +\r\n[tau])], cannot be communicated with the same amplitude to the same\r\nnervous end-organ. On the contrary, an end-organ that reacts best to the\r\nperiod _r_ responds more weakly to the period _r_ + [rho], the two\r\namplitudes bearing to each other the proportion _a_: [phi]_a_. Here\r\n[phi] decreases when [rho] increases, and when [rho] = 0 it becomes\r\nequal to 1, so that only the portion of the stimulus [phi]_a_ is subject\r\nto beats, and the portion (1-[phi])_a_ continues smoothly onward without\r\ndisturbance.\r\n\r\nIf there is any moral to be drawn from the history of this theory, it is\r\nthat considering how near Sauveur's errors were to the truth, it\r\nbehooves us to exercise some caution also with regard to the new theory.\r\nAnd in reality there seems to be reason for doing so.\r\n\r\nThe fact that a musician will never confound a more perfectly consonant\r\nchord on a poorly tuned piano with a less perfectly consonant chord on a\r\nwell tuned piano, although the roughness in the two cases may be the\r\nsame, is sufficient indication that the degree of roughness is not the\r\nonly characteristic of a harmony. As the musician knows, even the\r\nharmonic beauties of a Beethoven sonata are not easily effaced on a\r\npoorly tuned piano; they scarcely suffer more than a Raphael\r\ndrawing executed in rough unfinished strokes. The _positive\r\nphysiologico-psychological_ characteristic which distinguishes one\r\nharmony from another is not given by the beats. Nor is this\r\ncharacteristic to be found in the fact that, for example, in sounding a\r\nmajor third the fifth partial tone of the lower note coincides with the\r\nfourth of the higher note. This characteristic comes into consideration\r\nonly for the investigating and abstracting reason. If we should regard\r\nit also as characteristic of the sensation, we should lapse into a\r\nfundamental error which would be quite analogous to that cited in (1).\r\n\r\nThe _positive physiological_ characteristics of the intervals would\r\ndoubtless be speedily revealed if it were possible to conduct aperiodic,\r\nfor example galvanic, stimuli to the single sound-sensing organs, in\r\nwhich case the beats would be totally eliminated. Unfortunately such an\r\nexperiment can hardly be regarded as practicable. The employment of\r\nacoustic stimuli of short duration and consequently also free from\r\nbeats, involves the additional difficulty of a pitch not precisely\r\ndeterminable.\r\n\r\n  FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 134: This article, which appeared in the Proceedings of\r\n  the German Mathematical Society of Prague for the year 1892, is\r\n  printed as a supplement to the article on \"The Causes of Harmony,\"\r\n  at page 32.]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 135: The present exposition is taken from the volumes for\r\n  1700 (published in 1703) and for 1701 (published in 1704), and\r\n  partly also from the _Histoire de l'Académie_ and partly from the\r\n  _Mémoires_.

In\r\nsuch an event, of course, and if the supposition is correct, the\r\nmagnitudes of the residua with which the percepts or representations are\r\ncoalesced (the helps to coalescence) are of cardinal influence.\r\nFurthermore, since the coalescences must first be fully perfected before\r\nthey make their appearance, and since upon their appearance the\r\ninhibitory ratios are brought into play, ultimately, then, if we leave\r\nout of account the accidental order of time in which the percepts are\r\ngiven, everything in spatial vision depends on the oppositions and\r\naffinities, or, in brief, on the qualities of the percepts, which enter\r\ninto series.\r\n\r\nLet us see how the theory stands with respect to the special facts\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\n1. If intersecting series only, running anteriorly and posteriorly, are\r\nrequisite for the production of spatial sensation, why are not analogues\r\nof them found in all the senses?\r\n\r\n2. Why do we measure differently colored objects and variegated objects\r\nwith one and the same spatial measure? How do we recognise differently\r\ncolored objects as the same in size? Where do we get our measure of\r\nspace from and what is it?\r\n\r\n3. Why is it that differently colored figures of the same form reproduce\r\none another and are recognised as the same?\r\n\r\nHere are difficulties enough. Herbart is unable to solve them by his\r\ntheory. The unprejudiced student sees at once that his \"inhibition by\r\nreason of form\" and \"preference by reason of form\" are absolutely\r\nimpossible. Think of Herbart's example of the red and black letters.\r\n\r\nThe \"help to coalescence\" is a passport, so to speak, made out to the\r\nname and person of the percept. A percept which is coalesced with\r\nanother cannot reproduce all others qualitatively different from it for\r\nthe simple reason that the latter are in like manner coalesced with one\r\nanother. Two qualitatively different series certainly do not reproduce\r\nthemselves because they present the same order of degree of coalescence.\r\n\r\nIf it is certain that only things simultaneous and things which are\r\nalike are reproduced, a basic principle of Herbart's psychology which\r\neven the most absolute empiricists will not deny, nothing remains but to\r\nmodify the theory of spatial perception or to invent in its place a new\r\nprinciple in the manner indicated, a step which hardly any one would\r\nseriously undertake. The new principle could not fail to throw all\r\npsychology into the most dreadful confusion.\r\n\r\nAs to the modification which is needed there can be hardly any doubt as\r\nto how in the face of the facts and conformably to Herbart's own\r\nprinciples it is to be carried out. If two differently colored figures\r\nof equal size reproduce each other and are recognised as equal, the\r\nresult can be due to nothing but to the existence in both series of\r\npresentations of a presentation or percept which is qualitatively _the\r\nsame_. The colors are different. Consequently, like or equal percepts\r\nmust be connected with the colors which are yet independent of the\r\ncolors. We have not to look long for them, for they are the like effects\r\nof the muscular feelings of the eye when confronted by the two figures.\r\nWe might say we reach the vision of space by the registering of\r\nlight-sensations in a schedule of graduated muscle-sensations.[148]\r\n\r\nA few considerations will show the likelihood of the rôle of the\r\nmuscle-sensations. The muscular apparatus of _one_ eye is unsymmetrical.\r\nThe two eyes together form a system which is vertical in symmetry. This\r\nalready explains much.\r\n\r\n1. The _position_ of a figure influences its view. According to the\r\nposition in which objects are viewed different muscle-sensations come\r\ninto play and the impression is altered. To recognise inverted letters\r\nas such long experience is required. The best proof of this are the\r\nletters d, b, p, q, which are represented by the same figure in\r\ndifferent positions and yet are always distinguished as different.[149]\r\n\r\n2. It will not escape the attentive observer that for the same reasons\r\nand even with the same figure and in the same position the fixation\r\npoint is also decisive. The figure seems to change _during_ the act of\r\nvision. For example, an eight-pointed star constructed by successively\r\njoining in a regular octagon the first corner with the fourth, the\r\nfourth with the seventh, etc., skipping in every case two corners,\r\nassumes alternately, according to where we suffer the centre of vision\r\nto rest, a predominantly architectonic or a freer and more open\r\ncharacter. Vertical and horizontal lines are always differently\r\napprehended from what oblique lines are.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58.]\r\n\r\n3. The reason why we prefer vertical symmetry and regard it as something\r\nspecial in its kind, whereas we do not recognise horizontal symmetry at\r\nall immediately, is due to the vertical symmetry of the muscular\r\napparatus of the eye. The left-hand side _a_ of the accompanying\r\nvertically-symmetrical figure induces in the left eye the same muscular\r\nfeelings as the right-hand side _b_ does in the right eye. The pleasing\r\neffect of symmetry has its cause primarily in the repetition of muscular\r\nfeelings. That a repetition actually occurs here, sometimes sufficiently\r\nmarked in character as to lead to the confounding of objects, is proved\r\napart from the theory by the fact which is familiar to every one _quem\r\ndii oderunt_ that children frequently reverse figures from the right to\r\nthe left, but never from above downwards; for example, write [epsilon]\r\ninstead of 3 until they finally come to notice the slight difference.\r\nFigure 50 shows how pleasing the repetition of muscular feelings may be.\r\nAs will be readily understood, vertical and horizontal lines exhibit\r\nrelations similar to symmetrical figures which are immediately disturbed\r\nwhen oblique positions are chosen for the lines. Compare what Helmholtz\r\nsays regarding the repetition and coincidence of partial tones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59.]\r\n\r\nI may be permitted to add a general remark. It is a quite universal\r\nphenomenon in psychology that certain qualitatively quite different\r\nseries of percepts mutually awaken and reproduce one another and in a\r\ncertain aspect produce the appearance of sameness or similarity. We say\r\nof such series that they are of like or of similar form, naming their\r\nabstracted likeness _form_.\r\n\r\n     1. Of spatial figures we have already spoken.\r\n\r\n     2. We call two melodies like melodies when they present the same\r\n     succession of pitch-ratios; the absolute pitch (or key) may be as\r\n     different as can be. We can so select the melodies that not even\r\n     two partial tones of the notes in each are common. Yet we recognise\r\n     the melodies as alike. And, what is more, we notice the form of the\r\n     melody more readily and recognise it again more easily than the key\r\n     (the absolute pitch) in which it was played.\r\n\r\n     3. We recognise in two different melodies the same rhythm no matter\r\n     how different the melodies may be otherwise. We know and recognise\r\n     the rhythm more easily even than the absolute duration (the tempo).\r\n\r\nThese examples will suffice. In all these and in all similar cases the\r\nrecognition and likeness cannot depend upon the qualities of the\r\npercepts, for these are different. On the other hand recognition,\r\nconformably to the principles of psychology, is possible only with\r\npercepts which are the same in quality. Consequently there is no other\r\nescape than to imagine the qualitatively unlike percepts of the two\r\nseries as necessarily connected with other percepts which are\r\nqualitatively alike.\r\n\r\nSince in differently colored figures of like form, like muscular\r\nfeelings are necessarily induced if the figures are recognised as alike,\r\nso there must necessarily lie at the basis of all forms also, and we\r\nmight even say at the basis of all abstractions, percepts of a peculiar\r\nquality. And this holds true for space and form as well as for time,\r\nrhythm, pitch, the form of melodies, intensity, etc. But whence is\r\npsychology to derive all these qualities? Have no fear, they will all be\r\nfound, as were the sensations of muscles for the theory of space. The\r\norganism is at present still rich enough to meet all the requirements of\r\npsychology in this direction, and it is even time to give serious ear to\r\nthe question of \"corporeal resonance\" which psychology so loves to dwell\r\non.\r\n\r\nDifferent psychical qualities appear to bear a very intimate mutual\r\nrelation to one another. Special research on the subject, as well also\r\nas the demonstration that this remark may be generally employed in\r\nphysics, will follow later.[150]\r\n\r\n  FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 147: This article, designed to illustrate historically\r\n  that on Symmetry, at page 89, first appeared in Fichte's\r\n  _Zeitschrift für Philosophie_, for 1865.]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 148: Comp.

Professor Mach is a striking instance of the combination of\r\ngreat mathematical knowledge with experimental skill, as exemplified not\r\nonly by the elegant illustrations of mechanical principles which abound\r\nin this treatise, but also from his brilliant experiments on the\r\nphotography of bullets.... A careful study of Professor Mach's work, and\r\na treatment with more experimental illustration, on the lines laid down\r\nin the interesting diagrams of his _Science of Mechanics_, will do much\r\nto revivify theoretical mechanical science, as developed from the\r\nelements by rigorous logical treatment.\"--Prof. A. G. Greenhill, in\r\n_Nature_, London.\r\n\r\n\"Those who are curious to learn how the principles of mechanics have\r\nbeen evolved, from what source they take their origin, and how far they\r\ncan be deemed of positive and permanent value, will find Dr. Mach's able\r\ntreatise entrancingly interesting.... The book is a remarkable one in\r\nmany respects, while the mixture of history with the latest scientific\r\nprinciples and absolute mathematical deductions makes it exceedingly\r\nattractive.\"--_Mechanical World_, Manchester and London, England.\r\n\r\n\"Mach's Mechanics is unique. It is not a text-book, but forms a useful\r\nsupplement to the ordinary text-book. The latter is usually a skeleton\r\noutline, full of mathematical symbols and other abstractions. Mach's\r\nbook has 'muscle and clothing,' and being written from the historical\r\nstandpoint, introduces the leading contributors in succession, tells\r\nwhat they did and how they did it, and often what manner of men they\r\nwere. Thus it is that the pages glow, as it were, with a certain\r\nhumanism, quite delightful in a scientific book.... The book is\r\nhandsomely printed, and deserves a warm reception from all interested in\r\nthe progress of science.\"--_The Physical Review_, New York and London.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. T. J. McCormack, by his effective translation, where translation\r\nwas no light task, of this masterly treatise upon the earliest and most\r\nfundamental of the sciences, has rendered no slight service to the\r\nEnglish speaking student. The German and English languages are generally\r\naccounted second to none in their value as instruments for the\r\nexpression of scientific thought; but the conversion bodily of an\r\nabstruse work from one into the other, so as to preserve all the meaning\r\nand spirit of the original and to set it easily and naturally into its\r\nnew form, is a task of the greatest difficulty, and when performed so\r\nwell as in the present instance, merits great commendation. Dr. Mach has\r\ncreated for his own works the severest possible standard of judgment. To\r\nexpect no more from the books of such a master than from the elementary\r\nproductions of an ordinary teacher in the science would be undue\r\nmoderation. Our author has lifted what, to many of us, was at one time a\r\ncourse of seemingly unprofitable mental gymnastics, encompassed only at\r\nvast expenditure of intellectual effort, into a study possessing a deep\r\nphilosophical value and instinct with life and interest. 'No profit\r\ngrows where is no pleasure ta'en,' and the emancipated collegian will\r\nturn with pleasure from the narrow methods of the text-book to where the\r\nscience is made to illustrate, by a treatment at once broad and deep,\r\nthe fundamental connexion between all the physical sciences, taken\r\ntogether.\"--_The Mining Journal_, London, England.\r\n\r\n\"As a history of mechanics, the work is admirable.\"--_The Nation_, New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\n\"An excellent book, admirably illustrated.\"--_The Literary World_,\r\nLondon, England.\r\n\r\n\"Sets forth the elements of its subject with a lucidity, clearness, and\r\nforce unknown in the mathematical text-books ... is admirably fitted to\r\nserve students as an introduction on historical lines to the principles\r\nof mechanical science.\"--_Canadian Mining and Mechanical Review_,\r\nOttawa, Can.\r\n\r\n\"A masterly book.... To any one who feels that he does not know as much\r\nas he ought to about physics, we can commend it most heartily as a\r\nscholarly and able treatise ... both interesting and profitable.\"--A. M.\r\nWellington, in _Engineering News_, New York.\r\n\r\n\"The book as a whole is unique, and is a valuable addition to any\r\nlibrary of science or philosophy.... Reproductions of quaint old\r\nportraits and vignettes give piquancy to the pages. The numerous\r\nmarginal titles form a complete epitome of the work; and there is that\r\ninvaluable adjunct, a good index. Altogether the publishers are to be\r\ncongratulated upon producing a technical work that is thoroughly\r\nattractive in its make-up.\"--Prof. D. W. Hering, in _Science_.\r\n\r\n\"There is one other point upon which this volume should be commended,\r\nand that is the perfection of the translation. It is a common fault that\r\nbooks of the greatest interest and value in the original are oftenest\r\nbutchered or made ridiculous by a clumsy translator. The present is a\r\nnoteworthy exception.\"--_Railway Age_.\r\n\r\n\"The book is admirably printed and bound.... The presswork is\r\nunexcelled by any technical books that have come to our hands for some\r\ntime, and the engravings and figures are all clearly and well\r\nexecuted.\"--_Railroad Gazette_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONIALS OF PROMINENT EDUCATORS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am delighted with Professor Mach's _Science of Mechanics_.\"--_M.

F. Magie_, Professor of Physics,\r\nPrinceton University, Princeton, N. J.\r\n\r\n\"The _Science of Mechanics_ by Mach, translated by T. J. McCormack, I\r\nregard as a most valuable work, not only for acquainting the student\r\nwith the history of the development of Mechanics, but as serving to\r\npresent to him most favorably the fundamental ideas of Mechanics and\r\ntheir rational connexion with the highest mathematical developments. It\r\nis a most profitable book to read along with the study of a text-book of\r\nMechanics, and I shall take pleasure in recommending its perusal by my\r\nstudents.\"--_S. W.

For\r\nlightness of touch and yet solid value of information the chapter 'Why\r\nHas Man Two Eyes?' has scarcely a rival in the whole realm of popular\r\nscientific writing.\"--_The Boston Traveller_.\r\n\r\n\"Truly remarkable in the insight they give into the relationship of the\r\nvarious fields cultivated under the name of Physics.... A vein of humor\r\nis met here and there reminding the reader of Heaviside, never offending\r\none's taste. These features, together with the lightness of touch with\r\nwhich Mr. McCormack has rendered them, make the volume one that may be\r\nfairly called rare. The spirit of the author is preserved in such\r\nattractive, really delightful, English that one is assured nothing has\r\nbeen lost by translation.\"--Prof. Henry Crew, in _The Astrophysical\r\nJournal_.\r\n\r\n\"A very delightful and useful book.... The author treats some of the\r\nmost recondite problems of natural science, in so charmingly untechnical\r\na way, with such a wealth of bright illustration, as makes his meaning\r\nclear to the person of ordinary intelligence and education.... This is a\r\nwork that should find a place in every library, and that people should\r\nbe encouraged to read.\"--_Daily Picayune_, New Orleans.\r\n\r\n\"In his translation Mr. McCormack has well preserved the frank, simple,\r\nand pleasing style of this famous lecturer on scientific topics.\r\nProfessor Mach deals with the live facts, the salient points of science,\r\nand not with its mysticism or dead traditions. He uses the simplest of\r\nillustrations and expresses himself clearly, tersely, and with a\r\ndelightful freshness that makes entertaining reading of what in other\r\nhands would be dull and prosy.\"--_Engineering News_, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\"The general reader is led by plain and easy steps along a delightful\r\nway through what would be to him without such a help a complicated maze\r\nof difficulties. Marvels are invented and science is revealed as the\r\nnatural foe to mysteries.\"--_The Chautauquan_.\r\n\r\n\"The beautiful quality of the work is not marred by abstruse discussions\r\nwhich would require a scientist to fathom, but is so simple and so clear\r\nthat it brings us into direct contact with the matter treated.\"--_The\r\nBoston Post_.\r\n\r\n\"A masterly exposition of important scientific truths.\"--_Scotsman_,\r\nEdinburgh.\r\n\r\n\"These lectures by Dr. Mach are delightfully simple and frank; there is\r\nno dryness or darkness of technicalities, and science and common life do\r\nnot seem separated by a gulf....

Thus, the religion of\r\n_The Open Court_ is the Religion of Science, that is, the religion of\r\nverified and verifiable truth.\r\n\r\nAlthough opposed to irrational orthodoxy and narrow bigotry, _The Open\r\nCourt_ does not attack the properly religious element of the various\r\nreligions. It criticises their errors unflinchingly but without\r\nanimosity, and endeavors to preserve of them all that is true and good.\r\n\r\nThe current numbers of _The Open Court_ contain valuable original\r\narticles from the pens of distinguished thinkers. Accurate and\r\nauthorised translations are made in Philosophy, Science, and Criticism\r\nfrom the literature of Continental Europe, and reviews of noteworthy\r\nrecent investigations are presented. Portraits of eminent philosophers\r\nand scientists are published, and appropriate illustrations accompany\r\nsome of the articles.\r\n\r\nTerms: $1.00 a year; $1.35 to foreign countries in the Postal Union.\r\nSingle Copies, 10 cents.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MONIST\r\n\r\nA QUARTERLY MAGAZINE OF\r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHY AND SCIENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE MONIST_ discusses the fundamental problems of Philosophy in their\r\npractical relations to the religious, ethical, and sociological\r\nquestions of the day.
