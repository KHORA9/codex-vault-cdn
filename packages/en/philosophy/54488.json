We see a flower slowly\r\n    developing from a bud, and the bud from its seed. But whence the\r\n    latter, with all its predetermined programme of physical\r\n    transformation, and its invisible, therefore _spiritual_, forces\r\n    which gradually develop its form, colour, and odour? The word\r\n    _evolution_ speaks for itself. The germ of the present human race\r\n    must have preëxisted in the parent of this race, as the seed, in\r\n    which lies hidden the flower of next summer, was developed in the\r\n    capsule of its parent flower; the parent may be but _slightly_\r\n    different, but it still differs from its future progeny. The\r\n    antediluvian ancestors of the present elephant and lizard were,\r\n    perhaps, the mammoth and the plesiosaurus; why should not the\r\n    progenitors of our human race have been the “giants” of the\r\n    _Vedas_, the _Voluspa_, and the _Book of Genesis_? While it is\r\n    positively absurd to believe the “transformation of species” to\r\n    have taken place according to some of the more materialistic views\r\n    of the Evolutionists, it is but natural to think that each genus,\r\n    beginning with the molluscs and ending with monkey‐man, has\r\n    modified from its own primordial and distinctive form.—ISIS\r\n    UNVEILED, I. 152‐3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY NOTES ON THE ARCHAIC STANZAS, AND THE FOUR PRE‐HISTORIC\r\nCONTINENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacies totius universi, quamvis infinitis modis variet,\r\nManet tamen semper eadem.—SPINOZA.\r\n\r\nThe Stanzas, with the Commentaries thereon, in this Volume, are drawn from\r\nthe same Archaic Records as the Stanzas on Cosmogony in Volume I. As far\r\nas possible a verbatim translation is given: but some of the Stanzas are\r\ntoo obscure to be understood without explanation, and therefore, as in\r\nVolume I, they are first given in full as they stand, and then, when taken\r\nverse by verse with their Commentaries, an attempt is made to make them\r\nclearer, by words added in foot‐notes, in anticipation of the fuller\r\nexplanation of the Commentary.\r\n\r\nAs regards the Evolution of mankind, the Secret Doctrine postulates three\r\nnew propositions, which stand in direct antagonism to Modern Science as\r\nwell as to current religious dogmas. It teaches: (_a_) the simultaneous\r\nevolution of seven human Groups on seven different portions of our globe;\r\n(_b_) the birth of the _astral_, before the _physical_ body, the former\r\nbeing a model for the latter; and (_c_) that man, in this Round, preceded\r\nevery mammalian—the anthropoids included—in the animal kingdom.(1)\r\n\r\nThe Secret Doctrine is not alone in speaking of primeval Men born\r\nsimultaneously on the seven divisions of our Globe. In the _Divine\r\nPymander_ of Hermes Trismegistus, we find the same seven primeval Men(2)\r\nevolving from Nature and the Heavenly Man, in the collective sense of the\r\nword, namely, from the Creative Spirits; and in the fragments of Chaldæan\r\ntablets, collected by George Smith, on which is inscribed the Babylonian\r\nLegend of Creation, in the first column of the Cutha tablet, seven human\r\nBeings “with the faces of ravens,” that is to say, of black swarthy\r\ncomplexions, whom “the [seven] Great Gods created,” are mentioned. Or, as\r\nexplained in lines 16, 17 and 18:\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the earth they grew up and became great,\r\nAnd increased in number,\r\nSeven kings, brothers of the same family.(3)\r\n\r\nThese are the seven Kings of Edom to whom reference is made in the\r\n_Kabalah_; the First Race, which was _imperfect_, that is to say, was born\r\nbefore the “balance” (sexes) existed, and which was therefore\r\ndestroyed.(4)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Seven Kings, brethren, appeared and begat children, 6,000 in\r\n    number were their peoples. The God Nergas [death] destroyed them.\r\n    “How did he destroy them?” By bringing into equilibrium [or\r\n    balance] those who did not yet exist.(5)\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were “destroyed,” as a Race, by being merged in their own progeny (by\r\nexudation): that is to say, the sexless Race reïncarnated in the\r\n(potentially) bisexual; the latter, in the androgynes; these again, in the\r\nsexual, the later Third Race. Were the tablets less mutilated, they would\r\nbe found to contain word for word the same account as is given in the\r\nArchaic Records and in Hermes, at least as regards the fundamental facts,\r\nif not as regards minute details; for Hermes is a good deal disfigured by\r\nmistranslations.\r\n\r\nIt is quite certain that the seeming supernaturalism of these teachings,\r\nalthough allegorical, is so diametrically opposed to the dead‐letter\r\nstatements of the Bible,(6) as well as to the latest hypotheses of\r\nScience, that it will evoke passionate denial. The Occultists, however,\r\nknow that the traditions of Esoteric Philosophy must be the right ones,\r\nsimply because they are the most logical, and reconcile every difficulty.\r\nBesides, we have the Egyptian _Books of Thoth_, and _Book of the Dead_,\r\nand the Hindû _Purânas_ with their seven Manus, as well as the Chaldæo‐\r\nAssyrian accounts, whose tiles mention seven primitive Men, or Adams, the\r\nreal meaning of which name may be ascertained by means of the _Kabalah_.\r\nThose who know anything of the Samothracian Mysteries will also remember\r\nthat the generic name of the Kabiri was the “Holy Fires,” which created on\r\nseven localities of the island of Electria, or Samothrace, the “Kabir born\r\nof the Holy Lemnos”—the island sacred to Vulcan.\r\n\r\nAccording to Pindar, this Kabir, whose name was Adamas,(7) was, in the\r\ntraditions of Lemnos, the type of the primitive man born from the bosom of\r\nthe Earth. He was the archetype of the first males in the order of\r\ngeneration, and was one of the seven autochthonous ancestors or\r\nprogenitors of mankind.(8) If, coupling with this the fact that Samothrace\r\nwas colonized by the Phœnicians, and before them by the mysterious\r\nPelasgians who came from the East, we also remember the identity of the\r\n“Mystery” Gods of the Phœnicians, Chaldæans, and Israelites, it will be\r\neasy to discover whence came also the confused account of the Noachian\r\nDeluge. It has become undeniable of late that the Jews, who obtained their\r\nprimitive ideas about creation from Moses, who had them from the\r\nEgyptians, compiled their Genesis and first cosmogonic traditions, when\r\nrewritten by Ezra and others, from the Chaldæo‐Akkadian account. It is,\r\ntherefore, sufficient to examine the Babylonian and Assyrian cuneiform and\r\nother inscriptions to find also therein, scattered here and there, not\r\nonly the original meaning of the name Adam, Admi, or Adami, but also the\r\ncreation of seven Adams or roots of Men, born of Mother Earth, physically,\r\nand of the Divine Fire of the Progenitors, spiritually or astrally. The\r\nAssyriologists, ignorant of the Esoteric teachings, could hardly be\r\nexpected to pay any greater attention to the mysterious and ever‐recurring\r\nnumber _seven_ on the Babylonian cylinders, than they pay to it on finding\r\nit in _Genesis_ and the rest of the _Bible_. Yet the numbers of the\r\nancestral spirits and their seven groups of human progeny are on the\r\ncylinders, notwithstanding the dilapidated condition of the fragments, and\r\nare to be found as plainly, as they are in _Pymander_ and in the _Book of\r\nthe Concealed Mystery_ of the _Kabalah_. In the latter Adam Kadmon is the\r\nSephirothal Tree, as also the “Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.”\r\nAnd that Tree, says verse 32, “hath around it seven columns,” or palaces,\r\nof the seven creative Angels operating in the Spheres of the seven Planets\r\non our Globe. As Adam Kadmon is a _collective_ name, so also is the name\r\nof the man Adam. Says George Smith, in his _Chaldean Account of Genesis_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The word Adam used in these legends for the first human being is\r\n    evidently _not a proper name, but is only used as a term for\r\n    mankind_. Adam appears as a proper name in _Genesis_, but\r\n    certainly in some passages is only used in the same sense as the\r\n    Assyrian word.(9)\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, neither the Chaldæan nor the Biblical Deluge, with their stories\r\nof Xisuthrus and Noah, is based on the universal or even on the Atlantean\r\nDeluges, recorded in the Indian allegory of Vaivasvata Manu. They are the\r\nexoteric allegories based on the Esoteric Mysteries of Samothrace. If the\r\nolder Chaldæans knew the Esoteric truth concealed in the Purânic legends,\r\nthe other nations were aware only of the Samothracian Mystery, and\r\nallegorized it. They adapted it to their astronomical and anthropological,\r\nor rather phallic, notions. Samothrace is known historically to have been\r\nfamous in antiquity for a deluge, which submerged the country and reached\r\nthe top of the highest mountains; an event which happened before the age\r\nof the Argonauts. It was overflowed very suddenly by waters from the\r\nEuxine, which had been regarded up to that time as a lake.(10) But the\r\nIsraelites had, moreover, another legend upon which to base their\r\nallegory, the legend of the Deluge, that transformed the present Gobi\r\nDesert into a sea _for the last time_, some 10,000 or 12,000 years ago,\r\nand which drove many Noahs and their families to the surrounding\r\nmountains. As the Babylonian accounts are only now restored from hundreds\r\nof thousands of broken fragments—the mound of Kouyunjik alone having\r\nyielded from Layard’s excavations upwards of twenty thousand fragments of\r\ninscriptions—the proofs here cited are comparatively scanty; yet such as\r\nthey are, they corroborate almost every one of our teachings; three most\r\ncertainty, at the very least. These are:\r\n\r\n(1) That the race which was the first to fall into generation was a dark\r\nrace (zalmat‐qaqadi), which they call the Adamu or Dark Race, and that\r\nSarku, or the Light Race, remained pure for a long while subsequently.\r\n\r\n(2) That the Babylonians recognized two principal Races at the time of the\r\nFall, the Race of the Gods, the Ethereal Doubles of the Pitris, having\r\npreceded these two. This is Sir H. Rawlinson’s opinion. These Races are\r\nour Second and Third Root‐Races.\r\n\r\n(3) That these seven Gods, each of whom created a Man, or Group of men,\r\nwere “the Gods imprisoned or incarnated.” These Gods were: the God Zi; the\r\nGod Zi‐ku, Noble Life, Director of Purity; the God Mir‐ku, Noble Crown,\r\n“Saviour from death of the Gods [later on] imprisoned,” and the creator of\r\n“the dark races which his hand has made”; the God Libzu, “wise among the\r\nGods”; the God Nissi; the God Suhhab; and Hea or Sa, their synthesis, the\r\nGod of Wisdom and of the Deep, identified with Oannes‐Dagon, at the time\r\nof the Fall, and called, collectively, the Demiurge, or Creator.(11)\r\n\r\nThere are two “Creations” so‐called, in the Babylonian fragments, and as\r\n_Genesis_ has adhered to this, we find its first two chapters\r\ndistinguished as the Elohite and the Jehovite Creations. Their proper\r\norder, however, is not preserved in these or in any other exoteric\r\naccounts. Now these “Creations,” according to the Occult Teachings, refer\r\nrespectively to the formation of the primordial seven Men by the\r\nProgenitors, the Pitris, or Elohim, and to that of the human Groups after\r\nthe Fall.\r\n\r\nAll this will be examined in the light of Science and comparisons drawn\r\nfrom the scriptures of all the ancient nations, the _Bible_ included, as\r\nwe proceed. Meanwhile, before we turn to the Anthropogenesis of the\r\nprehistoric Races, it may be useful to agree upon the names to be given to\r\nthe Continents on which the four great Races, which preceded our Adamic\r\nRace, were born, lived, and died. Their archaic and Esoteric names were\r\nmany, and varied with the language of the nation which mentioned them in\r\nits annals and scriptures. That which in the _Vendîdâd_, for instance, is\r\nreferred to as Airyana Vaêjô(12) wherein was born the original\r\nZoroaster,(13) is called in the Purânic literature Shveta Dvîpa, Mount\r\nMeru, the Abode of Vishnu, etc.; and in the Secret Doctrine is simply\r\nnamed the “Land of the Gods,” under their chiefs, the “Spirits of this\r\nPlanet.”\r\n\r\nTherefore, in view of the possible, and even very probable confusion, that\r\nmay arise, it is considered more convenient to adopt, for each of the four\r\nContinents constantly referred to, a name more familiar to the cultured\r\nreader. It is proposed, then, to call the first Continent, or rather the\r\nfirst _terra firma_ on which the First Race was evolved by the divine\r\nProgenitors:\r\n\r\nI. The Imperishable Sacred Land.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the name is that it is stated that: this “Imperishable\r\nSacred Land” never shared the fate of the other Continents, because it is\r\nthe only one whose destiny it is to last from the beginning to the end of\r\nthe Manvantara throughout each Round. It is the cradle of the first man\r\nand the dwelling of the last _divine_ mortal, chosen as a Shishta for the\r\nfuture seed of humanity. Of this mysterious and sacred land very little\r\ncan be said, except, perhaps, according to a poetical expression in one of\r\nthe Commentaries, that the “_Pole‐star has its watchful eye upon it, from\r\nthe dawn to the close of the twilight of a Day of the Great Breath_.”(14)\r\n\r\nII. The Hyperborean.\r\n\r\nThis will be the name chosen for the second Continent, the land which\r\nstretched out its promontories southward and westward from the North Pole\r\nto receive the Second Race, and comprised the whole of what is now known\r\nas Northern Asia. Such was the name given by the oldest Greeks to the far‐\r\noff and mysterious region, whither their tradition made Apollo, the\r\nHyperborean, travel every year. Astronomically, Apollo is, of course, the\r\nSun, who, abandoning his Hellenic sanctuaries, loved to annually visit his\r\nfar‐away country, where the Sun was said to never set for one half of the\r\nyear. “Ἐγγὺς γὰρ νυκτός τε καὶ ἤματος εἰσι κέλευθοι,” says a verse in the\r\nOdyssey.(15)\r\n\r\nBut historically, or better, perhaps, ethnologically and geologically, the\r\nmeaning is different. The land of the Hyperboreans, the country that\r\nextended beyond Boreas, the frozen‐hearted God of snows and hurricanes,\r\nwho loved to slumber heavily on the chain of Mount Rhipæus, was neither an\r\nideal country, as surmized by the Mythologists, nor yet a land in the\r\nneighbourhood of Scythia and the Danube.(16) It was a real Continent, a\r\n_bonâ fide_ land, which knew no winter in those early days, nor have its\r\nsorry remains more than one night and day during the year, even now. The\r\nnocturnal shadows never fall upon it, said the Greeks; for it is the “Land\r\nof the Gods,” the favourite abode of Apollo, the God of light, and its\r\ninhabitants are his beloved priests and servants. This may be regarded as\r\npoetized _fiction_ now; but it was poetized _truth_ then.\r\n\r\nIII. Lemuria.\r\n\r\nThe third Continent, we propose to call Lemuria. The name is an invention,\r\nor an idea, of Mr. P. L. Sclater, who, between 1850 and 1860, asserted on\r\nzoological grounds the actual existence, in prehistoric times, of a\r\nContinent which he showed to have extended from Madagascar to Ceylon and\r\nSumatra. It included some portions of what is now Africa; but otherwise\r\nthis gigantic Continent, which stretched from the Indian Ocean to\r\nAustralia, has now wholly disappeared beneath the waters of the Pacific,\r\nleaving here and there only some of its highland tops which are now\r\nislands. Mr. A. R. Wallace, the Naturalist, writes Mr. Charles Gould:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Extends the Australia of Tertiary periods to New Guinea and the\r\n    Solomon Islands, and perhaps to Fiji, and from its marsupial types\r\n    infers a connection with the northern continent during the\r\n    Secondary period.(17)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject is treated at length elsewhere.(18)\r\n\r\nIV. Atlantis.\r\n\r\nThus we name the fourth Continent. It would be the first historical land,\r\nwere the traditions of the Ancients to receive more attention than they\r\nhave hitherto. The famous island of Plato of that name was but a fragment\r\nof this great Continent.(19)\r\n\r\nV. Europe.\r\n\r\nThe fifth Continent was America; but, as it is situated at the Antipodes,\r\nit is Europe and Asia Minor, almost coëval with it, which are generally\r\nreferred to by the Indo‐Aryan Occultists as the fifth. If their teaching\r\nfollowed the appearance of the Continents in their geological and\r\ngeographical order, then this classification would have to be altered. But\r\nas the sequence of the Continents is made to follow the order of evolution\r\nof the Races, from the First to the Fifth, our Âryan Root‐Race, Europe\r\nmust be called the fifth great Continent. The Secret Doctrine takes no\r\naccount of islands and peninsulas, nor does it follow the modern\r\ngeographical distribution of land and sea. Since the day of its earliest\r\nteachings and the destruction of the great Atlantis, the face of the Earth\r\nhas changed more than once. There was a time when the delta of Egypt and\r\nNorthern Africa belonged to Europe, before the formation of the Straits of\r\nGibraltar and a further upheaval of the Continent entirely changed the\r\nface of the map of Europe. The last serious change occurred some 12,000\r\nyears ago,(20) and was followed by the submersion of Plato’s little\r\nAtlantic island, which he calls Atlantis after its parent continent.\r\nGeography was part of the Mysteries, in days of old. Says the _Zohar_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    These secrets [of land and sea] were divulged to the _men of the\r\n    secret science_, but not to the geographers.(21)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe claim that physical man was originally a colossal pre‐tertiary giant,\r\nand that he existed 18,000,000 years ago, must of course appear\r\npreposterous to admirers of, and believers in, modern learning. The whole\r\n_posse comitatus_ of Biologists will turn away from the conception of this\r\nThird Race Titan of the Secondary Age, a being fit to fight successfully\r\nwith the then gigantic monsters of the air, sea, and land; so his\r\nforefathers, the ethereal prototypes of the Atlantean, had little need to\r\nfear that which could not hurt them. The modern Anthropologist is quite\r\nwelcome to laugh at our Titans, as he laughs at the Biblical Adam, and as\r\nthe Theologian laughs at the former’s pithecoid ancestor. The Occultists\r\nand their severe critics may feel that they have pretty well mutually\r\nsquared their accounts by this time. Occult Sciences claim less and give\r\nmore, at all events, than either Darwinian Anthropology or Biblical\r\nTheology.\r\n\r\nNor ought the Esoteric Chronology to frighten anyone; for, with regard to\r\nfigures, the greatest authorities of the day are as fickle and as\r\nuncertain as the Mediterranean waves. As regards the duration of the\r\ngeological periods alone, the learned men of the Royal Society are all\r\nhopelessly at sea, and jump from one million to five hundred millions of\r\nyears with the utmost ease, as will be seen more than once during this\r\ncomparison.\r\n\r\nTake one instance for our present purpose—the calculations of Mr. Croll.\r\nWhether, according to this authority, 2,500,000 years represent the time\r\nsince the beginning of the Tertiary Age, or the Eocene period, as an\r\nAmerican geologist makes him say;(22) or whether again Mr. Croll “allows\r\nfifteen millions since the beginning of the Eocene period,” as quoted by\r\nan English geologist,(23) both sets of figures cover the claims made by\r\nthe Secret Doctrine.(24) For assigning as the latter does from four to\r\nfive million years between the incipient and the final evolution of the\r\nFourth Root‐Race, on the Lemuro‐Atlantean Continents; one million years\r\nfor the Fifth, or Âryan Race, to the present date; and about 850,000 since\r\nthe submersion of the last large peninsula of the great Atlantis—all this\r\nmay have easily taken place within the 15,000,000 years conceded by Mr.\r\nCroll to the Tertiary Age. But, chronologically speaking, the duration of\r\nthe period is of secondary importance, as we have, after all, certain\r\nAmerican Scientists to fall back upon. These gentlemen, unmoved by the\r\nfact that their assertions are called not only dubious but absurd, yet\r\nmaintain that man existed so far back as in the Secondary Age. They have\r\nfound human footprints on rocks of that formation; and furthermore, M. de\r\nQuatrefages finds no valid scientific reason why man should not have\r\nexisted during the Secondary Age.\r\n\r\nThe Ages and periods in Geology are, in sober truth, purely conventional\r\nterms, as they are still barely delineated, and, moreover, no two\r\nGeologists or Naturalists agree as to the figures. Thus, there is a wide\r\nmargin for choice offered to the Occultist by the learned fraternity.\r\nShall we take for one of our supports Mr. T. Mellard Read? This gentleman,\r\nin a paper on “Limestone as an Index of Geological Time,” read by him in\r\n1878 before the Royal Society, claims that the _minimum_ time required for\r\nthe formation of the sedimentary strata and the elimination of the\r\ncalcareous matter is in round numbers 600 million years;(25) or shall we\r\nask support for our chronology from Mr. Darwin’s works, wherein, according\r\nto his theory, he demands for the organic transformations from 300 to 500\r\nmillion years? Sir Charles Lyell and Prof. Houghton were satisfied with\r\nplacing the beginning of the Cambrian Age at 200 and 240 millions of years\r\nago, respectively. Geologists and Zoologists claim the maximum time,\r\nthough Mr. Huxley, at one time, placed the beginning of the incrustation\r\nof the earth at 1,000 million years ago, and would not surrender a\r\nmillennium of it.\r\n\r\nBut the main point for us lies not in the agreement or disagreement of the\r\nNaturalists as to the duration of geological periods, but rather in their\r\nperfect accord on one point, for a wonder, and this a very important one.\r\nThey all agree that during the Miocene Age—whether one or ten million\r\nyears ago—Greenland and even Spitzbergen, the remnants of our second or\r\nHyperborean Continent, “had an almost tropical climate.” Now the pre‐\r\nHomeric Greeks had preserved a vivid tradition of this “Land of the\r\nEternal Sun,” whither their Apollo journeyed yearly. Science tells us:\r\n\r\n\r\n    During the Miocene age, Greenland (in N. Lat. 70°) developed an\r\n    abundance of trees, such as the yew, the redwood, the sequoia,\r\n    allied to the Californian species, beeches, planes, willows, oaks,\r\n    poplars and walnuts, as well as a magnolia and a zamia.(26)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn short Greenland had southern plants unknown to northern regions.\r\n\r\nAnd now arises this natural question. If the Greeks, in the days of Homer,\r\nknew of a Hyperborean land, _i.e._, a blessed land beyond the reach of\r\nBoreas, the God of winter and of the hurricane, an ideal region which the\r\nlater Greeks and their writers have vainly tried to locate beyond Scythia,\r\na country where nights were short and days long, and beyond that a land\r\nwhere the Sun never set and the palm grew freely—if they knew of all this,\r\nwho then told them of it? In their day, and for ages previously, Greenland\r\nmust certainly have been already covered with perpetual snows, with never‐\r\nthawing ice, just as it is now. Everything tends to show that the land of\r\nthe short nights and the long days was Norway or Scandinavia, beyond which\r\nwas the blessed land of eternal light and summer. For the Greeks to know\r\nof this, the tradition must have descended to them from some people more\r\nancient than themselves, who were acquainted with those climatic details\r\nof which the Greeks themselves could know nothing. Even in our day,\r\nScience suspects that beyond the Polar seas, at the very circle of the\r\nArctic Pole, there exists a sea which never freezes and a continent which\r\nis ever green. The Archaic Teachings, and also the _Purânas_—for one who\r\nunderstands their allegories—contain the same statements. Suffice, then,\r\nfor us the strong probability that, during the Miocene period of Modern\r\nScience, at a time when Greenland was an almost tropical land, there lived\r\na people, now unknown to history.\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThe reader is requested to bear in mind that the following Sections are\r\nnot strictly consecutive in order of time.

ANTHROPOGENESIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwelve Stanzas From the “Book Of Dzyan,”(27)\r\n\r\nWith Commentaries.\r\n\r\nIn primeval times, a maiden,\r\nBeauteous Daughter of the Ether,\r\nPassed for ages her existence\r\nIn the great expanse of Heaven.\r\n\r\nSeven hundred years she wandered,\r\n\r\nSeven hundred years she laboured,\r\nEre her first‐born was delivered.\r\n\r\nEre a beauteous duck descending,\r\nHastens toward the water‐mother,\r\n\r\nLightly on the knee she settles,\r\nFinds a nesting‐place befitting,\r\nWhere to lay her eggs in safety.\r\n\r\nLays her eggs within, at pleasure,\r\nSix, the golden eggs she lays there,\r\nThen a Seventh, an egg of iron.\r\n\r\n_Kalevala_ (CRAWFORD).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nText.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStanza I.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Lha which turns the Fourth is Servant to the Lha(s) of the Seven,\r\nthey who revolve, driving their Chariots around their Lord, the One Eye of\r\nour World. His Breath gave Life to the Seven. It gave Life to the First.\r\n\r\n2. Said the Earth: “Lord of the Shining Face, my House is empty.... Send\r\nthy Sons to people this Wheel. Thou hast sent thy Seven Sons to the Lord\r\nof Wisdom. Seven times doth he see thee nearer to himself, seven times\r\nmore doth he feel thee. Thou hast forbidden thy Servants, the small Rings,\r\nto catch thy Light and Heat, thy great Bounty to intercept on its passage.\r\nSend now to thy Servant the same.”\r\n\r\n3. Said the Lord of the Shining Face: “I shall send thee a Fire when thy\r\nwork is commenced. Raise thy voice to other Lokas; apply to thy Father,\r\nthe Lord of the Lotus, for his Sons.... Thy People shall be under the rule\r\nof the Fathers. Thy Men shall be mortals. The Men of the Lord of Wisdom,\r\nnot the Sons of Soma, are immortal. Cease thy complaints. Thy Seven Skins\r\nare yet on thee.... Thou art not ready. Thy Men are not ready.”\r\n\r\n4. After great throes she cast off her old Three and put on her new Seven\r\nSkins, and stood in her first one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStanza II.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. The Wheel whirled for thirty crores more. It constructed Rûpas; soft\r\nStones that hardened, hard Plants that softened. Visible from invisible,\r\nInsects and small Lives. She shook them off her back whenever they overran\r\nthe Mother.... After thirty crores, she turned round. She lay on her back:\r\non her side.... She would call no Sons of Heaven, she would ask no Sons of\r\nWisdom. She created from her own Bosom. She evolved Water‐Men, terrible\r\nand bad.\r\n\r\n6. The Water‐Men, terrible and bad, she herself created from the remains\r\nof others. From the dross and slime of her First, Second, and Third, she\r\nformed them. The Dhyâni came and looked ... the Dhyâni from the bright\r\nFather‐Mother, from the White Regions they came, from the Abodes of the\r\nimmortal Mortals.\r\n\r\n7. Displeased they were. “Our Flesh is not there. No fit Rûpas for our\r\nBrothers of the Fifth. No Dwellings for the Lives. Pure Waters, not\r\nturbid, they must drink. Let us dry them.”\r\n\r\n8. The Flames came. The Fires with the Sparks; the Night‐Fires and the\r\nDay‐Fires. They dried out the turbid dark Waters. With their heat they\r\nquenched them. The Lhas of the High, the Lhamayin of Below, came. They\r\nslew the Forms which were two‐ and four‐faced. They fought the Goat‐Men,\r\nand the Dog‐Headed Men, and the Men with fishes’ bodies.\r\n\r\n9. Mother‐Water, the Great Sea, wept. She arose, she disappeared in the\r\nMoon, which had lifted her, which had given her birth.\r\n\r\n10. When they were destroyed, Mother Earth remained bare. She asked to be\r\ndried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStanza III.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. The Lord of the Lords came. From her Body he separated the Waters, and\r\nthat was Heaven above, the First Heaven.\r\n\r\n12. The great Chohans called the Lords of the Moon, of the Airy Bodies:\r\n“Bring forth Men, Men of your nature. Give them their Forms within. She\r\nwill build Coverings without. Males‐Females will they be. Lords of the\r\nFlame also....”\r\n\r\n13. They went each on his allotted Land; Seven of them, each on his Lot.\r\nThe Lords of the Flame remain behind. They would not go, they would not\r\ncreate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStanza IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n14. The Seven Hosts, the Will‐Born Lords, propelled by the Spirit of Life‐\r\nGiving, separate Men from themselves, each on his own Zone.\r\n\r\n15. Seven times seven Shadows of Future Men were born, each of his own\r\nColour and Kind. Each inferior to his Father. The Fathers, the Boneless,\r\ncould give no Life to Beings with Bones. Their progeny were Bhûta, with\r\nneither Form nor Mind. Therefore they are called the Chhâyâ Race.\r\n\r\n16. How are the Manushya born? The Manus with minds, how are they made?\r\nThe Fathers called to their help their own Fire, which is the Fire that\r\nburns in Earth. The Spirit of the Earth called to his help the Solar Fire.\r\nThese Three produced in their joint efforts a good Rûpa. It could stand,\r\nwalk, run, recline, or fly. Yet it was still but a Chhâyâ, a Shadow with\r\nno Sense....\r\n\r\n17. The Breath needed a Form; the Fathers gave it. The Breath needed a\r\nGross Body; the Earth moulded it. The Breath needed the Spirit of Life;\r\nthe Solar Lhas breathed it into its Form. The Breath needed a Mirror of\r\nits Body; “We gave it our own!”—said the Dhyânis. The Breath needed a\r\nVehicle of Desires; “It has it!”—said the Drainer of Waters. But Breath\r\nneeds a Mind to embrace the Universe; “We cannot give that!”—said the\r\nFathers. “I never had it!”—said the Spirit of the Earth. “The Form would\r\nbe consumed were I to give it mine!”—said the Great Fire.... Man remained\r\nan empty senseless Bhûta.... Thus have the Boneless given Life to those\r\nwho became Men with Bones in the Third.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStanza V.\r\n\r\n\r\n18. The First were the Sons of Yoga. Their sons, the children of the\r\nYellow Father and the White Mother.\r\n\r\n19. The Second Race was the product by budding and expansion, the A‐sexual\r\nfrom the Sexless.(28) Thus was, O Lanoo, the Second Race produced.\r\n\r\n20. Their Fathers were the Self‐born. The Self‐born, the Chhâyâ from the\r\nbrilliant Bodies of the Lords, the Fathers, the Sons of Twilight.\r\n\r\n21. When the Race became old, the old Waters mixed with the fresher\r\nWaters. When its Drops became turbid, they vanished and disappeared in the\r\nnew Stream, in the hot Stream of Life. The Outer of the First became the\r\nInner of the Second. The old Wing became the new Shadow, and the Shadow of\r\nthe Wing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStanza VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n22. Then the Second evolved the Egg‐born, the Third. The Sweat grew, its\r\nDrops grew, and the Drops became hard and round. The Sun warmed it; the\r\nMoon cooled and shaped it; the Wind fed it until its ripeness. The White\r\nSwan from the Starry Vault overshadowed the big Drop. The Egg of the\r\nFuture Race, the Man‐swan of the later Third. First male‐female, then man\r\nand woman.\r\n\r\n23. The Self‐born were the Chhâyâs, the Shadows from the Bodies of the\r\nSons of Twilight. Neither water nor fire could destroy them. Their sons\r\nwere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStanza VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n24. The Sons of Wisdom, the Sons of Night, ready for rebirth, came down.\r\nThey saw the vile forms of the First Third. “We can choose,” said the\r\nLords, “we have wisdom.” Some entered the Chhâyâs. Some projected a Spark.\r\nSome deferred till the Fourth. From their own Rûpa they filled the Kâma.\r\nThose who entered became Arhats. Those who received but a Spark, remained\r\ndestitute of knowledge; the Spark burned low. The Third remained mind‐\r\nless. Their Jîvas were not ready. These were set apart among the Seven.\r\nThey became narrow‐headed. The Third were ready. “In these shall we\r\ndwell,” said the Lords of the Flame and of the Dark Wisdom.\r\n\r\n25. How did the Mânasa, the Sons of Wisdom, act? They rejected the Self‐\r\nborn. They are not ready. They spurned the Sweat‐born. They are not quite\r\nready. They would not enter the first Egg‐born.\r\n\r\n26. When the Sweat‐born produced the Egg‐born, the twofold, the mighty,\r\nthe powerful with bones, the Lords of Wisdom said: “Now shall we create.”\r\n\r\n27. The Third Race became the Vâhan of the Lords of Wisdom. It created\r\nSons of Will and Yoga, by Kriyâshakti it created them, the Holy Fathers,\r\nAncestors of the Arhats....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStanza VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n28. From the drops of sweat, from the residue of the substance, matter\r\nfrom dead bodies of men and animals of the Wheel before, and from cast‐off\r\ndust, the first animals were produced.\r\n\r\n29. Animals with bones, dragons of the deep, and flying Sarpas were added\r\nto the creeping things. They that creep on the ground got wings. They of\r\nthe long necks in the water became the progenitors of the fowls of the\r\nair.\r\n\r\n30. During the Third, the boneless animals grew and changed; they became\r\nanimals with bones, their Chhâyâs became solid.\r\n\r\n31. The animals separated the first. They began to breed. The two‐fold man\r\nseparated also. He said: “Let us as they; let us unite and make\r\ncreatures.” They did....\r\n\r\n32. And those which had no Spark took huge she‐animals unto them. They\r\nbegat upon them dumb races. Dumb they were themselves. But their tongues\r\nuntied. The tongues of their progeny remained still. Monsters they bred. A\r\nrace of crooked red‐hair‐covered monsters going on all fours. A dumb race\r\nto keep the shame untold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStanza IX.\r\n\r\n\r\n33. Seeing which, the Lhas who had not built men, wept, saying:\r\n\r\n34. “The Amânasa have defiled our future abodes. This is Karma. Let us\r\ndwell in the others. Let us teach them better, lest worse should happen.”\r\nThey did....\r\n\r\n35. Then all men became endowed with Manas. They saw the sin of the\r\nmindless.\r\n\r\n36. The Fourth Race developed speech.\r\n\r\n37. The one became two; also all the living and creeping things that were\r\nstill one, giant fish, birds and serpents with shell‐heads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStanza X.\r\n\r\n\r\n38. Thus, two by two, on the seven Zones, the Third Race gave birth to the\r\nFourth; the Sura became A‐sura.\r\n\r\n39. The First, on every Zone, was moon‐coloured; the Second yellow like\r\ngold; the Third red; the Fourth brown, which became black with sin. The\r\nfirst seven human shoots were all of one complexion. The next seven began\r\nmixing.\r\n\r\n40. Then the Third and Fourth became tall with pride. “We are the kings;\r\nwe are the gods.”\r\n\r\n41. They took wives fair to look upon. Wives from the mindless, the\r\nnarrow‐headed. They bred monsters, wicked demons, male and female, also\r\nKhado, with little minds.\r\n\r\n42. They built temples for the human body. Male and female they\r\nworshipped. Then the Third Eye acted no longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStanza XI.\r\n\r\n\r\n43. They built huge cities. Of rare earths and metals they built. Out of\r\nthe fires vomited, out of the white stone of the mountains and of the\r\nblack stone, they cut their own images, in their size and likeness, and\r\nworshipped them.\r\n\r\n44. They built great images nine yatis high, the size of their bodies.\r\nInner fires had destroyed the land of their fathers. The water threatened\r\nthe Fourth.\r\n\r\n45. The first great waters came. They swallowed the seven great islands.\r\n\r\n46. All holy saved, the unholy destroyed. With them most of the huge\r\nanimals, produced from the sweat of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStanza XII.\r\n\r\n\r\n47. Few remained. Some yellow, some brown and black, and some red\r\nremained. The moon‐coloured were gone for ever.\r\n\r\n48. The Fifth produced from the holy stock remained; it was ruled over by\r\nthe first Divine Kings.\r\n\r\n49. ... The Serpents who re‐descended, who made peace with the Fifth, who\r\ntaught and instructed it....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommentaries On the Twelve Stanzas and Their Terms, According To Their\r\nNumeration, In Stanzas And Shlokas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStanza I. Beginnings of Sentient Life.\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. The Lha, or Spirit of the Earth. 2. Invocation of the Earth to\r\n    the Sun. 3. What the Sun answers. 4. Transformation of the Earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE LHA (_a_) WHICH TURNS THE FOURTH(29) IS SERVANT TO THE LHA(S) OF\r\nTHE SEVEN(30) (_b_), THEY WHO REVOLVE, DRIVING THEIR CHARIOTS AROUND THEIR\r\nLORD, THE ONE EYE(31) OF OUR WORLD. HIS BREATH GAVE LIFE TO THE SEVEN.(32)\r\nIT GAVE LIFE TO THE FIRST (_c_).\r\n\r\n“_They are all Dragons of Wisdom_,” adds the Commentary (_d_).\r\n\r\n(_a_) “Lha” is the ancient term in Trans‐Himâlayan regions for “Spirit,”\r\nany celestial or _super‐human_ Being, and it covers the whole series of\r\nheavenly hierarchies, from an Archangel, or Dhyâni, down to an Angel of\r\ndarkness, or terrestrial Spirit.\r\n\r\n(_b_) This expression shows in plain language that the Spirit‐Guardian of\r\nour Globe, which is the fourth in the Chain, is subordinate to the chief\r\nSpirit (or God) of the Seven Planetary Genii or Spirits. As already\r\nexplained, the Ancients had, in their Kyriel of Gods, seven chief Mystery‐\r\nGods, whose leader was, _exoterically_, the visible Sun, or the eighth,\r\nand, _Esoterically_, the Second Logos, the Demiurge. The Seven—who have\r\nnow, in the Christian religion, become the “Seven Eyes of the Lord”—were\r\nthe Regents of the seven _chief_ planets; but these were not reckoned\r\naccording to the enumeration devised later by people who had forgotten, or\r\nwho had an inadequate notion of, the real Mysteries, and included neither\r\nthe Sun, the Moon, nor the Earth. The Sun was the chief, exoterically, of\r\nthe twelve Great Gods, or zodiacal constellations; and, Esoterically, the\r\nMessiah, the Christos—the subject “anointed” by the Great Breath, or the\r\nOne—surrounded by his twelve subordinate powers, also subordinate, in\r\nturn, to each of the seven Mystery‐Gods of the planets.\r\n\r\n“_The Seven Higher make the Seven Lhas create the world_,” states a\r\nCommentary; which means that our Earth—to leave aside the rest—was\r\n“created” or fashioned by Terrestrial Spirits, the Regents being simply\r\nthe supervisors. This is the first germ of that which grew later into the\r\nTree of Astrology and Astrolatry. The Higher Ones were the Cosmocratores,\r\nthe fabricators of our Solar System. This is borne out by all the ancient\r\nCosmogonies, such as those of Hermes, of the Chaldæans, of the Aryans, of\r\nthe Egyptians, and even of the Jews. The Signs of the Zodiac—the “_Sacred\r\nAnimals_” or “Heaven’s Belt”—are as much the Bne’ Alhim—Sons of the Gods\r\nor the Elohim—as the Spirits of the Earth; but they are prior to them.\r\nSoma and Sin, Isis and Diana, are all lunar Gods or Goddesses, called the\r\nFathers and Mothers of our Earth, which is subordinate to them. But these,\r\nin their turn, are subordinate to their “Fathers” and “Mothers”—the latter\r\nbeing interchangeable and varying with each nation—the Gods and their\r\nPlanets, such as Jupiter, Saturn, Bel, Brihaspati, etc.\r\n\r\n(_c_) “His Breath gave Life to the Seven,” refers as much to the Sun, who\r\ngives life to the Planets, as to the “High One,” the _Spiritual Sun_, who\r\ngives life to the whole Kosmos. The astronomical and astrological keys\r\nopening the gate leading to the mysteries of Theogony can be found only in\r\nthe later glossaries, which accompany the Stanzas.\r\n\r\nIn the apocalyptic Shlokas of the Archaic Records, the language is as\r\nsymbolical, if less mythical, than in the _Purânas_. Without the help of\r\nthe later Commentaries, compiled by generations of Adepts, it would be\r\nimpossible to understand the meaning correctly. In the ancient\r\nCosmogonies, the visible and the invisible worlds are the double links of\r\none and the same chain. As the Invisible Logos, with its Seven\r\nHierarchies—each represented or personified by its chief Angel or\r\nRector—form one POWER, the inner and the invisible; so, in the world of\r\nForms, the Sun and the seven chief Planets constitute the visible and\r\nactive potency; the latter Hierarchy being, so to speak, the visible and\r\nobjective Logos of the Invisible and—except in the lowest grades—ever‐\r\nsubjective Angels.\r\n\r\nThus—to anticipate a little by way of illustration—every Race in its\r\nevolution is said to be born under the direct influence of one of the\r\nPlanets; Race the First receiving its breath of life from the Sun, as will\r\nbe seen later on; while the Third Humanity—those who fell into generation,\r\nor from androgynes became separate entities, one male and the other\r\nfemale—is said to be under the direct influence of Venus, “_the\r\n__‘__little sun__’__ in which the solar orb stores his light_.”\r\n\r\nThe summary of the Stanzas in Volume I showed the genesis(33) of Gods and\r\nmen taking rise in, and from, one and the same Point, which is the One\r\nUniversal, Immutable, Eternal, and Absolute UNITY. In its primary\r\nmanifested aspect we have seen it become: (1) in the sphere of objectivity\r\nand Physics, PRIMORDIAL SUBSTANCE and FORCE—centripetal and centrifugal,\r\npositive and negative, male and female, etc.; (2) in the world of\r\nMetaphysics, the SPIRIT OF THE UNIVERSE, or Cosmic Ideation, called by\r\nsome the LOGOS.\r\n\r\nThis Logos is the apex of the Pythagorean Triangle. When the Triangle is\r\ncomplete it becomes the Tetraktys, or the Triangle in the Square, and is\r\nthe dual symbol of the four‐lettered Tetragrammaton in the manifested\r\nKosmos, and of its radical triple Ray in the unmanifested—its Noumenon.\r\n\r\nPut more metaphysically, the classification given here of Cosmic\r\nUltimates, is more one of convenience than of absolute philosophical\r\naccuracy. At the commencement of a great Manvantara, Parabrahman manifests\r\nas Mûlaprakriti and then as the Logos. This Logos is equivalent to the\r\n“Unconscious Universal Mind,” etc., of Western Pantheists. It constitutes\r\nthe Basis of the _subject_‐side of manifested Being, and is the source of\r\nall manifestations of individual consciousness. Mûlaprakriti or Primordial\r\nCosmic Substance, is the foundation of the _object_‐side of things—the\r\nbasis of all objective evolution and cosmo‐genesis. Force, then, does not\r\nemerge with Primordial Substance from Parabrahmanic latency. It is the\r\n_transformation into energy of the supra‐conscious thought of the Logos_,\r\ninfused, so to speak, into the objectivation of the latter out of\r\npotential latency in the One Reality. Hence spring the wondrous laws of\r\nMatter; hence the “primal impress” so vainly discussed by Bishop Temple.\r\nForce thus is _not synchronous_ with the first objectivation of\r\nMûlaprakriti. Nevertheless as, apart from it, the latter is absolutely and\r\nnecessarily inert—_a mere abstraction_—it is unnecessary to weave too fine\r\na cobweb of subtleties as to the order of succession of the Cosmic\r\nUltimates. Force _succeeds_ Mûlaprakriti; but, _minus_ Force, Mûlaprakriti\r\nis for all practical intents and purposes non‐existent.(34)\r\n\r\nThe Heavenly Man or Tetragrammaton, who is the Protogonos, Tikkoun, the\r\nFirstborn from the passive Deity and the first manifestation of that\r\nDeity’s Shadow, is the Universal Form and Idea, which engenders the\r\nManifested Logos, Adam Kadmon, or the four‐lettered symbol, in the\r\nKabalah, of the Universe itself, also called the Second Logos. The Second\r\nsprings from the First and develops the Third Triangle;(35) from the last\r\nof which (the lower host of Angels) _Men_ are generated. It is with this\r\nthird aspect that we shall deal at present.\r\n\r\nThe reader must bear in mind that there is a great difference between the\r\nLogos and the Demiurgos, for one is _Spirit_ and the other is _Soul_; or\r\nas Dr. Wilder has it:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Dianoia and Logos are synonymous, Nous being superior and closely\r\n    in affinity with Τὸ Ἀγαθὸν, one being the superior apprehending,\r\n    the other the comprehending—one noëtic and the other phrenic.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, Man was regarded in several systems as the Third Logos. The\r\nEsoteric meaning of the word Logos—Speech or Word, Verbum—is the rendering\r\nin objective expression, as in a photograph, of the concealed thought. The\r\nLogos is the mirror reflecting DIVINE MIND, and the Universe is the mirror\r\nof the Logos, though the latter is the _esse_ of that Universe. As the\r\nLogos reflects _all_ in the Universe of Plerôma, so Man reflects in\r\nhimself all that he sees and finds in _his_ Universe, the Earth. It is the\r\nThree Heads of the Kabalah—“_unum intra alterum, et alterum super\r\nalterum._”(36) “Every Universe (World or Planet) has its own Logos,” says\r\nthe Doctrine. The Sun was always called by the Egyptians the “Eye of\r\nOsiris,” and was himself the Logos, the First‐begotten, or Light made\r\nmanifest to the world, “which is the Mind and divine Intellect of the\r\nConcealed.” It is only by the seven‐fold Ray of this Light that we can\r\nbecome cognizant of the Logos through the Demiurge, regarding the latter\r\nas the “Creator” of our Planet and everything pertaining to it, and the\r\nformer as the guiding Force of that “Creator”—good and bad at the same\r\ntime, the origin of good and the origin of evil. This “Creator” is neither\r\ngood nor bad _per se_, but its differentiated aspects in Nature make it\r\nassume one or the other character. With the invisible and the unknown\r\nUniverses disseminated through Space, none of the Sun‐Gods had anything to\r\ndo. The idea is expressed very clearly in the Books of Hermes, and in\r\nevery ancient folk‐lore. It is symbolized generally by the Dragon and the\r\nSerpent—the Dragon of Good and the Serpent of Evil, represented on Earth\r\nby the right and the left‐hand Magic. In the epic poem of Finland, the\r\n_Kalevala_,(37) the origin of the Serpent of Evil is given: it is born\r\nfrom the spittle of Suoyatar, and endowed with a Living Soul by the\r\nPrinciple of Evil, Hisi. A strife is described between the two, the “thing\r\nof evil,” the Serpent or Sorcerer, and Ahti, the Dragon of the white\r\nmagician, Lemminkainen. The latter is one of the seven sons of Ilmatar,\r\nthe virgin “daughter of the air,” she “who fell from heaven into the sea,”\r\nbefore Creation, _i.e._, Spirit transformed into the matter of sensuous\r\nlife. There is a world of meaning and Occult thought in the following few\r\nlines, admirably rendered by Dr. J. M. Crawford, of Cincinnati. The hero\r\nLemminkainen,\r\n\r\n\r\n    Hews the wall with might of magic,\r\n    Breaks the palisade in pieces,\r\n    Hews to atoms _seven_ pickets,\r\n    Chops the _serpent‐wall_ to fragments.\r\n\r\n    When the monster little heeding,\r\n\r\n    Pounces with his mouth of venom\r\n    At the head of Lemminkainen.\r\n    But the hero, quick recalling,\r\n    Speaks the _master‐words of knowledge_,\r\n    Words that came from distant ages,\r\n    Words his ancestors had taught him.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) In China the men of Fohi, or the “Heavenly Man,” are called the\r\ntwelve Tien‐Hoang, the twelve Hierarchies of Dhyânis or Angels, with human\r\nfaces, and dragon bodies; the Dragon standing for Divine Wisdom or\r\nSpirit;(38) and they create men by incarnating themselves in seven figures\r\nof clay—earth and water—made in the shape of these Tien‐Hoang, a third\r\nallegory.(39) The twelve Æsers of the Scandinavian Eddas do the same. In\r\nthe Secret Catechism of the Druses of Syria—a legend which is repeated\r\nword for word by the oldest tribes about and around the Euphrates—men were\r\ncreated by the “Sons of God,” who descended on Earth, and after gathering\r\nseven Mandragoras, they animated the roots, which forthwith became\r\nmen.(40)\r\n\r\nAll these allegories point to one and the same origin—to the dual and\r\ntriple nature of man; dual, as male and female; triple, as being of\r\nspiritual and psychic essence _within_, and of a material fabric without.\r\n\r\n2. SAID THE EARTH, “LORD OF THE SHINING FACE,(41) MY HOUSE IS EMPTY....\r\nSEND THY SONS TO PEOPLE THIS WHEEL.(42) THOU HAST SENT THY SEVEN SONS TO\r\nTHE LORD OF WISDOM (_A_). SEVEN TIMES DOTH HE SEE THEE NEARER TO HIMSELF;\r\nSEVEN TIMES MORE DOTH HE FEEL THEE (_B_). THOU HAST FORBIDDEN THY\r\nSERVANTS, THE SMALL RINGS, TO CATCH THY LIGHT AND HEAT, THY GREAT BOUNTY\r\nTO INTERCEPT ON ITS PASSAGE. SEND NOW TO THY SERVANT THE SAME!”\r\n\r\n(_a_) The “Lord of Wisdom” is Mercury, or Budha.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The modern Commentary explains the words as a reference to a well‐\r\nknown astronomical fact, that Mercury receives seven times more light and\r\nheat from the Sun than the Earth, or even the beautiful Venus, which\r\nreceives but twice the amount falling on our insignificant Globe. Whether\r\nthe fact was known in antiquity may be inferred from the prayer of the\r\n“Earth Spirit” to the Sun as given in the text.(43) The Sun, however,\r\nrefuses to people the Globe, as it is not ready to receive life as yet.\r\n\r\nMercury, as an astrological Planet, is still more Occult and mysterious\r\nthan Venus. It is identical with the Mazdean Mithra, the Genius, or God,\r\n“established between the Sun and the Moon, the perpetual companion of the\r\n‘Sun’ of Wisdom.” Pausanias (Bk. v.) shows him as having an altar in\r\ncommon with Jupiter. He had wings to express his attendance upon the Sun\r\nin its course; and he was called the Nuntius and Sun‐wolf, “_solaris\r\nluminis particeps_.” He was the leader and evocator of Souls, the great\r\nMagician and the Hierophant. Virgil depicts him as taking his wand to\r\nevoke from Orcus the souls plunged therein—_tum virgam capit, hac animas\r\nille evocat Orco_.(44) He is the Golden‐coloured Mercury, the Χρυσοφαὴς\r\nἙρμῆς whom the Hierophants forbade to name. He is symbolized in Grecian\r\nmythology by one of the “dogs” (vigilance), which watch over the celestial\r\nflock (Occult Wisdom), or Hermes Anubis, or again Agathodæmon. He is the\r\nArgus watching over the Earth, mistaken by the latter for the Sun itself.\r\nIt is through the intercession of Mercury that the Emperor Julian prayed\r\nto the Occult Sun every night; for, as says Vossius:\r\n\r\n\r\n    All the theologians assert that _Mercury and the Sun are one_....\r\n    He was the most eloquent and the most wise of all the Gods, which\r\n    is not to be wondered at, since _Mercury is in such close\r\n    proximity to the Wisdom and the Word of God_ [the Sun] that he was\r\n    confused with both.(45)\r\n\r\n\r\nVossius here utters a greater Occult truth than he suspected. The Hermes\r\nof the Greeks is closely related to the Hindû Saramâ and Sârameya, the\r\ndivine watchman, “who watches over the golden flock of stars and solar\r\nrays.”\r\n\r\nIn the clearer words of the Commentary:\r\n\r\n_The Globe, propelled onward by the Spirit of the Earth and his six\r\nAssistants, gets all its vital forces, life, and powers through the medium\r\nof the seven planetary Dhyânis from the Spirit of the Sun. They are his\r\nmessengers of Light and Life._\r\n\r\n_Like each of the Seven Regions of the Earth, each of the seven_(_46_)_\r\nFirst‐born [the primordial Human Groups] receives its light and life from\r\nits own especial Dhyâni—spiritually, and from the Palace [House, the\r\nPlanet] of that Dhyâni—physically; so with the seven great Races to be\r\nborn on it. The First is born under the Sun; the Second under Brihaspati\r\n[Jupiter]; the Third under Lohitânga [Mars, the __“__Fiery‐bodied,__”__\r\nand also under Venus or Shukra]; the Fourth, under Soma [the Moon, our\r\nGlobe also, the Fourth Sphere being born under and from the Moon] and\r\nShani, Saturn,_(_47_)_ the Krûra‐lochana [Evil‐eyed], and the Asita [the\r\nDark]; the Fifth, under Budha [Mercury]._\r\n\r\n_So also with man and every __“__man__”__ [every principle] in man. Each\r\ngets its specific quality from its Primary [the Planetary Spirit],\r\ntherefore every man is a septenate [or a combination of principles, each\r\nhaving its origin in a quality of that special Dhyâni]. Every active power\r\nor force __ of the Earth comes to her from one of the seven Lords. Light\r\ncomes through Shukra [Venus], who receives a triple supply, and gives one‐\r\nthird of it to the Earth. Therefore the two are called __“__Twin‐\r\nsisters,__”__ but the Spirit of the Earth is subservient to the\r\n__“__Lord__”__ of Shukra. Our wise men represent the two Globes, one over,\r\nthe other under the double Sign [the primeval Svastika bereft of its four\r\narms, or the cross, ☩]._(48)\r\n\r\nThe “double sign” is, as every student of Occultism knows, the symbol of\r\nthe male and the female principles in Nature, of the positive and the\r\nnegative, for the Svastika or 卐 is all that and much more. All antiquity,\r\never since the birth of Astronomy—imparted to the Fourth Race by one of\r\nthe Kings of the Divine Dynasty—and also of Astrology, represented Venus\r\nin its astronomical tables as a _Globe poised over a Cross_, and the\r\nEarth, as a _Globe under a Cross_. The Esoteric meaning of this is the\r\nEarth fallen into generation, or into the production of its species\r\nthrough sexual union. But the later Western nations have not failed to\r\ngive it quite a different interpretation. They explained the sign through\r\ntheir Mystics—guided by the light of the Latin Church—as meaning that our\r\nEarth and all on it were redeemed _by the Cross_, while Venus—otherwise\r\nLucifer or Satan—was trampling upon it. Venus is the most Occult,\r\npowerful, and mysterious of all the Planets; the one whose influence upon,\r\nand relation to, the Earth is most prominent. In exoteric Brâhmanism,\r\nVenus or Shukra—a male deity(49)—is the son of Bhrigu, one of the\r\nPrajâpati and a Vedic sage, and is Daitya‐Guru, or the priest‐instructor\r\nof the primeval giants. The whole history of Shukra in the _Purânas_,\r\nrefers to the Third and Fourth Races. As says the Commentary:\r\n\r\n_It is through Shukra that the __“__double ones__”__ [the hermaphrodites]\r\nof the Third [__Root‐Race__] descended from the first __“__Sweat‐\r\nborn.__”__ Therefore it is represented under the symbol [Symbol: circle\r\nwith horizontal line through it] [the circle and diameter], during the\r\nThird [Race], and [Symbol: circle with horizontal line through it, and\r\nanother from center to bottom], during the Fourth._\r\n\r\nThis needs explanation. The diameter, when found isolated in a circle,\r\nstands for female Nature; for the first ideal World, _self‐generated_ and\r\n_self‐impregnated_ by the universally diffused Spirit of Life—thus also\r\nreferring to the primitive Root‐Race. It becomes androgynous as the Races\r\nand all else on Earth develop into their physical forms, and the symbol is\r\ntransformed into a circle with a diameter from which runs a vertical line,\r\nexpressive of male and female, not separated as yet—the first and earliest\r\nEgyptian Tau; [Symbol: circle with horizontal line through it, and another\r\nfrom center to bottom] after which it becomes ☩, or male female\r\nseparated(50) and fallen into generation. Venus (the Planet), is\r\nsymbolized by the sign of a globe over a cross, which shows the former as\r\npresiding over the natural generation of man. The Egyptians symbolized\r\nAnkh, “life,” by the ansated cross, or ☥, which is only another form of\r\nVenus (Isis), ♀, and meant, Esoterically, that mankind and all animal life\r\nhad stepped out of the divine spiritual circle and had fallen into\r\nphysical male and female generation. This sign, from the end of the Third\r\nRace, has the same phallic significance as the “_Tree_ of Life” in Eden.\r\nAnouki, a form of Isis, is the Goddess of Life; and Ankh was taken by the\r\nHebrews from the Egyptians. It was introduced into the language by Moses,\r\none learned in the Wisdom of the priests of Egypt, with many other\r\nmystical words. The word Ankh in Hebrew, with the personal suffix, means\r\n“my life”—my being—which “is the personal pronoun Anochi,” from the name\r\nof the Egyptian Goddess Anouki.(51)\r\n\r\nIn one of the most ancient Catechisms of Southern India, Madras\r\nPresidency, the hermaphrodite Goddess Ardhanârî,(52) has the ansated\r\ncross, the Svastika, the “male and female sign,” right in the central\r\npart, to denote the pre‐sexual state of the Third Race. Vishnu, who is now\r\nrepresented with a lotus growing out of his navel—or the Universe of\r\nBrahmâ evolving out of the central point, Nara—is shown in one of the\r\noldest carvings as double‐sexed (Vishnu and Lakshmî) standing on a lotus‐\r\nleaf floating on the water, the water rising in a semicircle and pouring\r\nthrough the Svastika, “the source of generation,” or of the descent of\r\nman.\r\n\r\nPythagoras calls Shukra‐Venus the _Sol alter_, the “other Sun.” Of the\r\n“seven Palaces of the Sun,” that of Lucifer‐Venus is the third in\r\nChristian and Jewish Kabalah, the _Zohar_ making of it the abode of\r\nSamael. According to the Occult Doctrine, this Planet is our Earth’s\r\n_primary_, and its spiritual prototype. Hence, Shukra’s car (Venus‐\r\nLucifer’s) is said to be drawn by an _Ogdoad_ of “_earth‐born_ horses,”\r\nwhile the steeds of the chariots of the other Planets are different.\r\n\r\n_Every sin committed on Earth is felt by Ushanas‐Shukra. The Guru of the\r\nDaityas is the Guardian Spirit of the Earth and Men. Every change on\r\nShukra is felt on, and reflected by, the Earth._\r\n\r\nShukra, or Venus, is thus represented as the Preceptor of the Daityas, the\r\ngiants of the Fourth Race, who, in the Hindû allegory, at one time\r\nobtained the sovereignty of all the Earth, and defeated the minor Gods.\r\nThe Titans of the Western allegory also are as closely connected with\r\nVenus‐Lucifer, which was identified by later Christians with Satan. And,\r\nas Venus, equally with Isis, was represented with cow’s horns on her head,\r\nthe symbol of mystic Nature—one convertible with, and significant of, the\r\nMoon, since all these were lunar Goddesses—the configuration of this\r\nPlanet is now placed by theologians between the horns of the mystic\r\nLucifer.(53) It is owing to the fanciful interpretation of the archaic\r\ntradition, which states that Venus changes simultaneously (geologically)\r\nwith the Earth, that whatever takes place on the one takes place on the\r\nother, and that many and great were their common changes—it is for these\r\nreasons that St. Augustine repeats it, applying the several changes of\r\nconfiguration, colour, and even of the orbital paths, to that\r\ntheologically‐woven character of Venus‐Lucifer. He even goes so far in his\r\npious fancy as to connect the last changes of the Planet with the Noachian\r\nand mythical Deluge alleged to have taken place 1796 B.C.(54)\r\n\r\nAs Venus has no satellites, it is stated allegorically, that Âsphujit\r\n(this “Planet”) adopted the Earth, the progeny of the Moon, “_who overgrew\r\nits parent and gave much trouble_”—a reference to the Occult connection\r\nbetween the two. The Regent (of the Planet) Shukra(55) loved his adopted\r\nchild so well that he incarnated as Ushanas and gave it perfect laws,\r\nwhich were disregarded and rejected in later ages. Another allegory, in\r\nthe _Harivansha_, is that Shukra went to Shiva and asked him to protect\r\nhis pupils, the Daityas and Asuras, from the fighting Gods; and that to\r\nfurther his object he performed a Yoga rite “imbibing the _smoke_ of chaff\r\nwith his _head downwards_ for 1,000 years.” This refers to the great\r\ninclination of the axis of Venus—amounting to fifty degrees—and to its\r\nbeing enveloped in eternal clouds. But it relates only to the physical\r\nconstitution of the Planet. It is with its Regent, the informing Dhyân\r\nChohan, that Occult Mysticism has to deal. The allegory which states that\r\nVishnu was cursed by Shukra to be _reborn seven times_ on the Earth as a\r\npunishment for killing his (Shukra’s) mother, is full of Occult\r\nphilosophical meaning. It does not refer to Vishnu’s Avatâras, since these\r\nnumber nine—the tenth being still to come—but to the Races on Earth.\r\nVenus, or Lucifer—also Shukra and Ushanas—the Planet, is the light‐bearer\r\nof our Earth, in both the physical and mystic sense. The Christians knew\r\nit well in early times, since one of the earliest popes of Rome is known\r\nby his pontiff‐name as Lucifer.\r\n\r\n_Every world has its parent Star and sister Planet. Thus Earth is the\r\nadopted, child and younger brother of Venus, but its inhabitants are of\r\ntheir own kind.... All sentient complete beings [full septenary men or\r\nhigher beings] are furnished, in their beginnings, with forms and\r\norganisms in full harmony with the nature and state of the Sphere they\r\ninhabit._(56)\r\n\r\n_The Spheres of Being, or Centres of Life, which are isolated nuclei\r\nbreeding their men and their animals, are numberless; not one has any\r\nresemblance to its sister‐companion or to any other in its own special\r\nprogeny._(57)\r\n\r\n_All have a double physical and spiritual nature._\r\n\r\n_The nucleoles are eternal and everlasting; the nuclei periodical and\r\nfinite. The nucleoles form part of the Absolute. They are the embrasures\r\nof that black impenetrable fortress, which is for ever concealed from\r\nhuman or even Dhyânic sight. The nuclei are the light of eternity escaping\r\ntherefrom._\r\n\r\n_It is that __LIGHT__ which condenses into the Forms of the __“__Lords of\r\nBeing__”__—the first and the highest of which are, collectively,\r\n__JÎVÂTMÂ__, or Pratyagâtmâ [which is said figuratively to issue from\r\nParamâtmâ. It is the Logos of the Greek philosophers—appearing at the\r\nbeginning of every new Manvantara]. From these downwards—formed from the\r\never‐consolidating waves of that Light, which becomes on the objective\r\nplane gross Matter—proceed the numerous Hierarchies of the Creative\r\nForces; some formless, others having their own distinctive form, others,\r\nagain, the lowest [Elementals], having no form of their own, but assuming\r\nevery form according to the surrounding conditions._\r\n\r\n_Thus there is but one Absolute Upâdhi [Basis] in the spiritual sense,\r\nfrom, on, and in which, are built for manvantaric purposes the countless\r\nbasic centres on which proceed the universal, cyclic, and individual\r\nEvolutions during the active period._\r\n\r\n_The informing Intelligences, which animate these various Centres of\r\nBeing, are referred to indiscriminately by men beyond the Great\r\nRange_(_58_)_ as the Manus, the Rishis, the Pitris,_(_59_)_ the Prajâpati,\r\nand so on; and as Dhyâni‐Buddhas, the Chohans, Melhas [Fire‐Gods],\r\nBodhisattvas,_(_60_)_ and others, on this side. The truly ignorant call\r\nthem Gods; the learned profane, the One God; and the wise, the Initiates,\r\nhonour in them only the manvantaric manifestations of __THAT__ which\r\nneither our Creators [the Dhyân Chohans] nor their creatures can ever\r\ndiscuss or know anything about. The __ABSOLUTE__ is not to be defined, and\r\nno mortal or immortal has ever seen or comprehended it during the periods\r\nof Existence. The mutable cannot know the Immutable, nor can that which\r\nlives perceive Absolute Life._\r\n\r\n“Therefore, man cannot know higher Beings than his own Progenitors.” “_Nor\r\nshall he worship them_,” but he ought to learn _how_ he came into the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nNumber Seven, the fundamental figure among all other figures in every\r\nnational religious system, from Cosmogony down to man, must have its\r\n_raison d’être_. It is found among the ancient Americans, as prominently\r\nas among the archaic Âryans and Egyptians. The question will be fully\r\ndealt with in the second Part of this Volume; meanwhile a few facts may be\r\ngiven here. Says the author of the _Sacred Mysteries among the Mayas and\r\nthe Quiches, 11,500 years ago_:(61)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Seven seems to have been the sacred number _par excellence_ among\r\n    all civilized nations of antiquity. Why? This query has never been\r\n    satisfactorily answered. Each separate people has given a\r\n    different explanation, according to the peculiar tenets of their\r\n    [exoteric] religion. That it was the number of numbers for those\r\n    initiated to the sacred mysteries there can be no doubt.\r\n    Pythagoras ... calls it the “Vehicle of life,” containing body and\r\n    soul, since it is formed of a quaternary, that is: _Wisdom and\r\n    Intellect_; and a Trinity, or _action_ and _matter_. The Emperor\r\n    Julian, in _Matrem_ and in _Oratio_,(62) expresses himself thus:\r\n    “Were I to touch upon the initiation into our secret mysteries,\r\n    which the Chaldees bacchized respecting the _seven‐rayed_ god,\r\n    lighting up the soul through him, I should say things unknown to\r\n    the rabble, very unknown, but well known to the blessed\r\n    Theurgists.”(63)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd who that is acquainted with the _Purânas_, the _Book of the Dead_, the\r\n_Zendavesta_, the Assyrian Tiles, and finally the _Bible_, and has\r\nobserved the constant occurrence of the number seven in these records of\r\npeople from the remotest times upwards unconnected and so far apart, can\r\nregard as a coincidence the following fact, given by the same explorer of\r\nancient Mysteries? Speaking of the prevalence of seven as a mystic number,\r\namong the inhabitants of the “Western Continent” of America, he adds that\r\nit is not less remarkable. For:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It frequently occurs in the _Popul‐Vuh_. We find it besides in the\r\n    _seven families_ said by Sahagun and Clavigero to have accompanied\r\n    the mystical personage named _Votan_, the reputed founder of the\r\n    great city of Nachan, identified by some with Palenque. In the\r\n    _seven caves_(64) from which the ancestors of the Nahualts are\r\n    reported to have emerged. In the _seven cities_ of Cibola,\r\n    described by Coronado and Niza.... In the _seven Antilles_; in the\r\n    _seven heroes_ who, we are told, escaped the Deluge.\r\n\r\n\r\nHeroes, moreover, whose number is found the same in every Deluge\r\nstory—from the seven Rishis who were saved with Vaivasvata Manu, down to\r\nNoah’s ark, into which beasts, fowls, and living creatures were taken by\r\n“sevens.” Thus we see the figures 1, 3, 5, 7, as perfect, because\r\nthoroughly mystic, numbers playing a prominent part in every Cosmogony and\r\nevolution of living Beings. In China, 1, 3, 5, 7, are called “celestial\r\nnumbers” in the canonical “Book of Changes”—_Yi King_, or\r\n_transformation_, as in “evolution.”\r\n\r\nThe explanation of it becomes evident when one examines the ancient\r\nSymbols: all these are based upon and start from the figures given from\r\nthe Archaic Manuscript in the Proem of Volume I. [Symbol: circle with\r\nhorizontal line through it, and another from center to bottom], the symbol\r\nof evolution and fall into generation or Matter, is reflected in the old\r\nMexican sculptures or paintings, as it is in the Kabalistic Sephiroth, and\r\nthe Egyptian Tau. Examine the Mexican MS. (_Add. MSS._ Brit. Mus.\r\n9789)(65); you will find it in a tree whose trunk is covered with _ten_\r\nfruits ready to be plucked by a male and female, one on each side of it,\r\nwhile from the top of the trunk two branches shoot horizontally to the\r\nright and left, thus forming a perfect Τ (Tau), the ends of the two\r\nbranches, moreover, each bearing a triple bunch, with a bird—the bird of\r\nimmortality, Âtmâ or the Divine Spirit—sitting between the two, and thus\r\nmaking the _seventh_. This represents the same idea as the Sephirothal\r\nTree, _ten_ in all, yet, when separated from its upper triad, leaving\r\n_seven_. These are the celestial fruits, the ten, or [Symbol: circle with\r\n“i” inside], 10, born out of the two invisible male and female seeds,\r\nmaking up the 12, or the Dodecahedron of the Universe. The mystic system\r\ncontains the ·, the central point; the 3, or [symbol: triangle]; the 5,\r\n[symbol: 5‐point star]; and the 7, or [symbol: triangle in square]; or\r\nagain [symbol: 6‐point star]; the triangle in the square and the\r\nsynthesizing point in the interlaced double triangles. This for the world\r\nof the archetypes. The phenomenal world receives its culmination and the\r\nreflex of all in MAN. Therefore he is the mystic square—in his\r\nmetaphysical aspect—the Tetraktys; and becomes the Cube on the creative\r\nplane. His symbol is the cube unfolded(66) and 6 becoming 7, or the\r\n[Symbol: cross], 3 crossways (the female) and 4 vertically; and this is\r\nman, the culmination of the deity on earth, whose body is the cross of\r\nflesh, _on_, _through_, and _in_ which he is ever crucifying and putting\r\nto death the divine Logos, or his HIGHER SELF. Says every Philosophy and\r\nCosmogony:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The universe hath a Ruler [Rulers collectively] set over it, which\r\n    is called the WORD (Logos); the fabricating Spirit is its Queen:\r\n    which two are the First Power after the ONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are the Spirit and Nature, which two form our Illusory Universe. The\r\ntwo inseparables remain in the _Universe of Ideas_ so long as it lasts,\r\nand then merge back into Parabrahman, the One ever changeless. “The\r\nSpirit, whose essence is eternal, one and self‐existent,” emanates a pure\r\nethereal Light—a dual light not perceptible to the elementary\r\nsenses—according to the _Purânas_, the _Bible_, the _Sepher Yetzirah_, the\r\nGreek and Latin Hymns, the _Book of Hermes_, the Chaldæan _Book of\r\nNumbers_, the Esotericism of Lao‐tse, and everywhere else. In the Kabalah,\r\nwhich explains the secret meaning of _Genesis_, this Light is the Dual‐\r\nMan, or the Androgyne (rather Sexless) Angels, whose generic name is Adam\r\nKadmon. It is they who complete man, whose ethereal form is emanated by\r\nother divine, but far lower Beings, who solidify the body with clay, or\r\nthe “dust of the ground”—an allegory indeed, but as scientific as any\r\nDarwinian evolution and more _true_.\r\n\r\nThe author of the _Source of Measures_ says that the foundation of the\r\nKabalah and of all its mystic books is made to rest upon the _ten_\r\nSephiroth; which is a fundamental truth. He shows these Ten Sephiroth or\r\nthe 10 Numbers as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Circle with numbers 2 through 9, and vertical line through\r\n                                   it]\r\n\r\nThe circle is the _naught_; its vertical diameter line is the first or\r\nprimal _One_ [the Word or Logos], from which spring the 2, the 3, and so\r\non to 9, the limit of the digits. The 10 is the first Divine\r\nManifestation,(67) which contains every possible power of exact expression\r\nof proportion—the sacred _Jod_. By this Cabbalah we are taught that these\r\nSephiroth were the _numbers_ or emanations of the heavenly Light (20612 to\r\n6561), they were the 10 Words, DBRIM, 41224, the light of which they were\r\nthe flux was the Heavenly man, the Adam‐KDM (the 144‐144); and the Light,\r\nby the New Testament or Covenant (41224) created God; just as by the Old\r\nTestament God (Alhim, 31415) creates Light (20612 to 6561).(68)\r\n\r\nNow there are three kinds of Light in Occultism, as in the Kabalah. (1)\r\nThe Abstract and Absolute Light, which is Darkness; (2) The Light of the\r\nManifested‐Unmanifested, called by some the Logos: and (3) The latter\r\nLight reflected in the Dhyân Chohans, the minor Logoi—the Elohim,\r\ncollectively—who, in their turn, shed it on the objective Universe. But in\r\nthe Kabalah—reëdited and carefully adjusted to fit the Christian tenets by\r\nthe Kabalists of the thirteenth century—the three Lights are described as:\r\n(1) The clear and penetrating, that of Jehovah; (2) reflected light; and\r\n(3) light _in the abstract_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This Light, abstractly taken, (in a metaphysical or symbolical\r\n    sense) is Alhim (Elohim, God), while the clear penetrating Light\r\n    is Jehovah. The light of Alhim belongs to the world in general, in\r\n    its allness and general fulness, but the light of Jehovah is that\r\n    pertaining to the chiefest production, man, whom this light\r\n    penetrated to and made.(69)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author of the _Source of Measures_ pertinently refers the reader to\r\nInman’s _Ancient Faiths Embodied in Ancient Names_, ii. 648. There, an\r\nengraving of\r\n\r\n\r\n    The _vesica piscis_, Mary, and the female emblem, copied from a\r\n    Rosary of the blessed Virgin Mary, which was printed at Venice,\r\n    1542,\r\n\r\n\r\nand therefore, as Inman remarks, “with a licence from the Inquisition, and\r\nconsequently orthodox,” will show the reader what the Latin Church\r\nunderstood by this “penetrating power of light and its effects.” How sadly\r\ndisfigured—applied as they were to the grossest anthropomorphic\r\nconceptions—have, under Christian interpretation, become the noblest and\r\ngrandest, as the most exalted, ideas of Deity of the Eastern Philosophy!\r\n\r\nThe Occultists in the East call this Light Daiviprakriti, and in the West\r\nthe Light of Christos. It is the Light of the Logos, the direct reflection\r\nof the ever Unknowable on the plane of Universal Manifestation. But here\r\nis the interpretation thereof given by the modern Christians from the\r\nKabalah. As declared by the author just cited;\r\n\r\n\r\n    To the fulness of the world in general with its chiefest content,\r\n    man, the term Elohim‐Jehovah applies. In extracts from Sohar, the\r\n    Rev. Dr. Cassell [a Kabalist], to prove that the Cabbalah sets\r\n    forth the doctrine of the Trinity, among other things says:\r\n    “Jehovah is Elohim (Alhim)” ... By _three_ steps God, (Alhim) and\r\n    Jehovah become the same, and though separated, each and together\r\n    they are of the same One.(70)\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Vishnu becomes the Sun, the visible symbol of the Impersonal\r\nDeity. Vishnu is described as “striding through the seven regions of the\r\nUniverse in _three steps_.” But with the Hindûs this is an _exoteric_\r\naccount, a surface tenet and an allegory, while the Kabalists give it out\r\nas the Esoteric and final meaning. But to proceed:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Now Light, as shown, is 20612 to 6561, as the proper enunciation\r\n    of the integral and numerical relation of diameter to\r\n    circumference of a circle. God (Alhim, that is, 31415 to One, a\r\n    modified form of the above) is the reduction of this, so as to\r\n    obtain a standard unit _One_, as the basis, in general, of all\r\n    calculation and all mensuration. But for the production of animal\r\n    life, and for especial _time measure_, or the lunar year, that\r\n    influence which causes conception and embryotic development, the\r\n    numbers of the Jehovah measure (the “_man even Jehovah_” measure),\r\n    viz., 113 to 355, have to be specialized.(71) But this last ratio\r\n    is but a modified form of Light, or 20612 to 6561, as a _pi\r\n    value_, being only a variation of the same (that is 20612 to 6561\r\n    is 31415 to one, and 355 to 113 is 31415 or Alhim or God), and in\r\n    such a manner that one can be made to flow into and be derived\r\n    from the other:—and these are the three steps by which the _Unity_\r\n    and sameness can be shown of the Divine names. That is, the two\r\n    are but variations of the same ratio, viz., that of _pi_. The\r\n    object of this comment is to show the same symbolic measuring use\r\n    for the Cabbalah, as taught, with that of the Three Covenants of\r\n    the _Bible_, and with that of Masonry as just noticed.\r\n\r\n    First, then, the Sephiroth are described as _Light_, that is, they\r\n    themselves are a function of, indeed, the same as, the\r\n    manifestation of the Ain Soph; and they are so from the fact that\r\n    “_Light_” represents the ratio 20612 to 6561, as part of the\r\n    “Words,” DBRIM, 41224, or, as to the Word, Dabar, 206 (= 10\r\n    cubits). “_Light_” is so much the burden of the Cabbalah as to\r\n    explaining the Sephiroth, that the most famous book on the\r\n    Cabbalah is called _Sohar_, or “_Light_.” In this we find\r\n    expressions of this kind: “The infinite was entirely unknown and\r\n    diffused no light before the luminous point violently broke\r\n    through into vision.” “When He first assumed the form (of the\r\n    crown, or the first Sephira), He caused 9 splendid lights to\r\n    emanate from it, which, shining through it, diffused a bright\r\n    light in all directions:”—that is, these 9 with his one (which was\r\n    the origin, as above, of the 9), together, made the 10, that is\r\n    [Symbol: circle with vertical line through it], or [Symbol: circle\r\n    with “x” inside], or the sacred Ten (numbers or Sephiroth), or\r\n    _Jod_—and these numbers were “_the Light_.” Just as in the Gospel\r\n    of St. John, God (Alhim, 31415 to one) was that Light (20612 to\r\n    6561) by which (Light) all things were made.(72)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the _Sepher Yetzirah_, or “Number of Creation,” the whole process of\r\nevolution is given out in numbers. In its “thirty‐two Paths of Wisdom” the\r\nnumber 3 is repeated four times, and the number 4 five times. Therefore,\r\nthe Wisdom of God is contained in numbers (Sephrim or Sephiroth), for\r\nSepher (or S‐ph‐r when unvowelled) means “to cipher.” And therefore, also,\r\nwe find Plato stating that the Deity “geometrizes” in fabricating the\r\nUniverse.\r\n\r\nThe Kabalistic book, the _Sepher Yetzirah_, opens with a statement of the\r\nhidden wisdom of Alhim in Sephrim, _i.e._, the Elohim in the Sephiroth.\r\n\r\n\r\n    In thirty and two paths, hidden wisdom, established Jah, IHVH,\r\n    Tzabaoth, Elohi of Israel, Alhim of Life, El of Grace and\r\n    Mercy—exalted uplifted Dweller on high, and King of Everlasting,\r\n    and His name—Holy! in Three Sephrim, viz.:\r\n\r\n    B—S’ph‐r, V—S’ph‐r, V—Siph‐o‐r.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Ralston Skinner goes on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n    This comment sets forth the “_hidden wisdom_” of the original text\r\n    by hidden wisdom, that is, by the use of words carrying a special\r\n    set of numbers and a special phraseology, which will set forth the\r\n    very explanatory system which we find to fit so accurately in the\r\n    Hebrew Bible.... In setting forth his scheme, to enforce it, and\r\n    to finish out his detailed exposition in a general\r\n    postulate,—viz., the one word “_Sephrim_” (_Sephiroth_), of the\r\n    Number Jezirah, the author explains the separation of this word in\r\n    the three subordinate ones, a play upon a common word, _s‐ph‐r_,\r\n    or number.\r\n\r\n    The prince Al‐Chazari(73) says to the Rabbi: “I wish now that thou\r\n    wouldest impart to me some of the chiefest or leading principles\r\n    of _Natural Philosophy_, which, as thou sayest, were in former\r\n    times worked out by them (the ancient wise ones);”—to which the\r\n    Rabbi makes answer: “To such principles appertains the Number of\r\n    Creation of our race‐father Abraham” that is Abram and Abraham, or\r\n    numbers 41224 and 41252. He then says that this book of number\r\n    treats of teaching the “_Alhim_‐ness and _One_‐ness through\r\n    (DBRIM)” viz., the numbers of the word “_Words_.” That is, it\r\n    teaches the use of the ratio 31415 to One, through 41224, which\r\n    last, in the description of the Ark of the Covenant, was divided\r\n    into two parts by the _two_ tables of stone, on which these DBRIM,\r\n    or 41224, were written or engraved—or 20612 × 2. He then comments\r\n    on these three subordinately used words, and takes care as to one\r\n    of them to make the comment, “and _Alhim_ (31415 to One) said let\r\n    there be Light (20612 to 6561).”\r\n\r\n    The words as given in the text are:\r\n\r\n    ספר ספר סיפור\r\n\r\n    and the Rabbi, in commenting upon them, says: “It teaches the\r\n    _Alhim_‐ness (31415) and _One_‐ness (the diameter to Alhim),\r\n    through Words (DBRIM = 41224), by which on the one side there is\r\n    infinite expression in heterogeneous creations, and on the other a\r\n    final harmonic tendency to _One_‐ness” (which, as everyone knows,\r\n    is the mathematical function of _pi_ of the schools, which\r\n    measures, weighs, and numbers the stars of heaven, and yet\r\n    resolves them back into the final oneness of the Uni‐verse)\r\n    “through Words. Their final accord perfects itself in that\r\n    _One_‐ness that ordains them, and which consists in\r\n\r\n    ספר ספר ספור ”\r\n\r\n    that is, the Rabbi, in his first comment, leaves the _jod_, or\r\n    _i_, out of one of the words, whereas afterwards he restores it\r\n    again. If we take the values of those subordinate words, we find\r\n    them to be 340, 340 and 346;—together these are 1026, and the\r\n    division of the general word into these has been to produce these\r\n    numbers—which by T’mura may be changed in various ways, for\r\n    various purposes.(74)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader is asked to turn to Stanza IV of Volume I, Shloka 3 and\r\nCommentary,(75) to find that the 3, 4, (7), and the thrice seven, or 1065,\r\nthe number of Jehovah, is the number of the 21 Prajâpati mentioned in the\r\n_Mahâbhârata_, or the three Sephrim (words in ciphers or figures). And\r\nthis comparison between the Creative Powers of Archaic Philosophy and the\r\nanthropomorphic Creator of _exoteric_ Judaism (since the _Esotericism_ of\r\nthe Jews shows its identity with the Secret Doctrine) will lead the\r\nstudent to perceive and discover that, in truth, Jehovah is but a “lunar”\r\nand “generation” God. It is a fact well known to every conscientious\r\nstudent of the Kabalah, that the deeper he dives into it, the more he\r\nfeels convinced that unless the Kabalah—or what is left of it—is read by\r\nthe light of the Eastern Esoteric Philosophy, its study leads only to the\r\ndiscovery that, on the lines traced by exoteric Judaism and Christianity,\r\nthe monotheism of both is nothing more exalted than ancient Astrolatry,\r\nnow vindicated by modern Astronomy. The Kabalists never cease to repeat\r\nthat Primal Intelligence can never be understood. It cannot be\r\ncomprehended, nor can it be located, therefore it has to remain nameless\r\nand negative. Hence the Ain Suph—the “Unknowable” and “UNNAMEABLE”—as It\r\ncould not be made manifest, was imagined as emanating Manifesting Powers.\r\nIt is then with its Emanations alone that human intellect has to, and can,\r\ndeal. Christian theology, having rejected the doctrine of Emanations and\r\nreplaced them with direct, conscious Creations of Angels and the rest out\r\nof _nothing_, now finds itself hopelessly stranded between\r\nSupernaturalism, or Miracle, and Materialism. An _extra_‐cosmic God is\r\nfatal to Philosophy: an _intra_‐cosmic Deity—_i.e._, Spirit and Matter\r\ninseparable from each other—is a philosophical necessity. Separate them\r\nand that which is left is a gross superstition under a mask of\r\nemotionalism. But why “geometrize,” as Plato has it, why represent these\r\nEmanations under the form of an immense arithmetical table? The question\r\nis well answered by the author just cited, who says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mental perception, to become physical perception, must have the\r\n    cosmic principle of _Light_:—and, by this, our mental circle must\r\n    become visible through light; or, for its complete manifestation,\r\n    the circle must be that of physical visibility, or Light itself.\r\n\r\n    Such conceptions, thus formulated, became the ground‐work of the\r\n    philosophy of the Divine manifesting in the universe.(76)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is Philosophy. It is otherwise when we find the Rabbi in _Al‐Chazari_\r\nsaying that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Under s’ph‐r is to be understood—_calculation_ and _weighing_ of\r\n    the created bodies. For the _calculation_, by means of which a\r\n    body must be constructed in harmony or symmetry, by which it must\r\n    be in construction rightly arranged and made to correspond to the\r\n    object in design, consists at last in _number_, _extension_,\r\n    _mass_, _weight_;—co‐ordinate relation of movements, then harmony\r\n    of music, must consist altogether _by number_, that is s’ph‐r....\r\n    By Sippor (s’phor) is to be understood the words of Alhim (206—1\r\n    of 31415 to one), whereunto joins or adapts itself the design to\r\n    the frame or form of construction; for example—it was said “Let\r\n    Light be.” The work became as the _words_ were spoken, that is, as\r\n    the numbers of the work came forth.(77)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is _materializing_ the _spiritual_ without scruple. But the Kabalah\r\nwas not always so well adapted to anthropo‐monotheistic conceptions.\r\nCompare this with any of the six schools of India. For instance in\r\nKapila’s Sânkhya Philosophy, unless, allegorically speaking, Purusha\r\nmounts on the shoulders of Prakriti, the latter remains irrational, while\r\nthe former remains inactive without her. Therefore Nature (in man) must\r\nbecome a compound of Spirit and Matter before he becomes what he is; and\r\nthe Spirit latent in Matter must be awakened to life and consciousness\r\ngradually. The Monad has to pass through its mineral, vegetable and animal\r\nforms, before the Light of the Logos is awakened in the animal man.\r\nTherefore, till then, the latter cannot be referred to as “man,” but has\r\nto be regarded as a Monad imprisoned in ever‐changing forms. _Evolution_,\r\nnot _Creation_, by means of _Words_ is recognized in the Philosophies of\r\nthe East, even in their exoteric records. _Ex oriente lux._ Even the name\r\nof the first man in the Mosaic _Bible_ had its origin in India, Professor\r\nMax Müller’s negation notwithstanding. The Jews got their Adam from\r\nChaldæa; and Adam‐Adami is a compound word and therefore a manifold\r\nsymbol, and proves the Occult dogmas.\r\n\r\nThis is no place for philological disquisitions. But the reader may be\r\nreminded that the words _Ad_ and _Adi_ mean in Sanskrit the “first”; in\r\nAramæan, “one” (_Ad‐ad_, the “only one”); in Assyrian, “Father,” whence\r\n_Ak‐ad_ or “father‐creator.”(78) And once the statement is found correct,\r\nit becomes rather difficult to confine Adam to the Mosaic _Bible_ alone,\r\nand to see therein simply a Jewish name.\r\n\r\nThere is frequent confusion in the attributes and genealogies of the Gods\r\nin their Theogonies, the Alpha and the Omega of the records of that\r\nsymbolical science, as given to the world by the half‐initiated writers,\r\nBrâhmanical and Biblical. Yet there could be no such confusion made by the\r\nearliest nations, the descendants and pupils of the Divine Instructors;\r\nfor both the attributes and the genealogies were inseparably linked with\r\ncosmogonical symbols, the “Gods” being the life and animating “soul‐\r\nprinciple” of the various regions of the Universe. Nowhere and by no\r\npeople was speculation allowed to range _beyond_ those _manifested_ Gods.\r\nThe boundless and infinite Unity remained with every nation a virgin\r\nforbidden soil, untrodden by man’s thought, untouched by fruitless\r\nspeculation. The only reference made to it was the brief conception of its\r\ndiastolic and systolic property, of its periodical expansion, or\r\ndilatation, and contraction. In the Universe, with all its incalculable\r\nmyriads of Systems and Worlds disappearing and reäppearing in eternity,\r\nthe anthropomorphized Powers, or Gods, their Souls, had to disappear from\r\nview with their Bodies. As our _Catechism_ says:\r\n\r\n“_The Breath returning to the Eternal Bosom which exhales and inhales\r\nthem_.”\r\n\r\nIdeal Nature, the Abstract Space in which everything in the Universe is\r\nmysteriously and invisibly generated, is the same female side of the\r\nprocreative power in Nature in the Vedic as in every other Cosmogony.\r\nAditi is Sephira, and the Sophia of the Gnostics, and Isis, the Virgin\r\nMother of Horus. In every Cosmogony, behind and higher than the “Creative”\r\nDeity, there is a Superior Deity, a Planner, an Architect, of whom the\r\nCreator is but the executive agent. And still higher, _over_ and _around_,\r\n_within_ and _without_, there is the Unknowable and the _Unknown_, the\r\nSource and Cause of all these Emanations.\r\n\r\nIt thus becomes easy to account for the reason why Adam‐Adami is found in\r\nthe Chaldæan scripture, certainly earlier than the Mosaic Books. In\r\nAssyrian _Ad_ is the “father,” and in Aramæan _Ad_ is “one,” and _Ad‐ad_\r\nthe “only one,” while _Ak_ is in Assyrian “creator.” Thus _Ad‐am‐ak‐ad‐\r\nmon_ became Adam‐Kadmon in the Kabalah (_Zohar_), meaning as it did, the\r\n“One (Son) of the divine Father, or the Creator,” for the words _am_ and\r\n_om_ meant at one time in nearly every language the _divine_, or the\r\n_deity_. Thus Adam‐Kadmon and Adam‐Adami came to mean “The first Emanation\r\nof the Father‐Mother or Divine Nature,” and literally the “first Divine\r\nOne.” And it is easy to see that _Ad_‐Argat (or Aster’t, the Syrian\r\nGoddess, the consort of _Ad‐on_, the Lord God of Syria or the Jewish\r\nAdonai), and Venus, Isis, Ister, Mylitta, Eve, etc., are identical with\r\nthe Aditi and Vâch of the Hindûs. They are all the “Mothers of all living”\r\nand “of the Gods.” On the other hand—cosmically and astronomically—all the\r\nmale Gods became at first “Sun‐Gods,” then, theologically, the “Suns of\r\nRighteousness,” and the Logoi, all symbolized by the Sun.(79) They are all\r\nProtogonoi—First‐born—and Mikroprosopoi. With the Jews Adam‐Kadmon was the\r\nsame as Athamaz, Tamaz, or the Adonis of the Greeks—“the One _with_, and\r\n_of_ his Father”—the “Father” becoming during the later Races Helios, the\r\nSun, as Apollo Karneios,(80) for instance, who was the “Sun‐born”; Osiris,\r\nOrmazd, and so on, were all followed by, and found themselves transformed\r\nlater on into, still more earthly types: such as Prometheus, the crucified\r\nof Mount Kajbee, Hercules, and so many others, Sun‐Gods and Heroes, until\r\nall of them came to have no better significance than phallic symbols.\r\n\r\nIn the _Zohar_ it is said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Man was created by the Sephiroth (Elohim‐Javeh, also) and they\r\n    engendered by common power the _earthly_ Adam.\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore in _Genesis_ the Elohim say: “Behold Man is become _as one of\r\nus_.” But in Hindû Cosmogony or “Creation,” Brahmâ‐Prajâpati _creates_\r\nVirâj and the Rishis, spiritually; therefore the latter are distinctly\r\ncalled the “Mind‐born Sons of Brahmâ”; and this specified mode of\r\n_engendering_ precluded every idea of Phallicism, at any rate in the\r\nearlier human nations. This instance well illustrates the respective\r\n_spirituality_ of the two nations.\r\n\r\n3. SAID THE LORD OF THE SHINING FACE: “I SHALL SEND THEE A FIRE WHEN THY\r\nWORK IS COMMENCED. RAISE THY VOICE TO OTHER LOKAS; APPLY TO THY FATHER,\r\nTHE LORD OF THE LOTUS(81) (_A_), FOR HIS SONS.... THY PEOPLE SHALL BE\r\nUNDER THE RULE OF THE FATHERS.(82) THY MEN SHALL BE MORTALS. THE MEN OF\r\nTHE LORD OF WISDOM,(83) NOT THE SONS OF SOMA,(84) ARE IMMORTAL. CEASE THY\r\nCOMPLAINTS (_B_). THY SEVEN SKINS ARE YET ON THEE.... THOU ART NOT READY.\r\nTHY MEN ARE NOT READY” (_C_).\r\n\r\n(_a_) Kumuda‐Pati is the Moon, the Earth’s parent, in his region of Soma‐\r\nloka. Though the Pitris, or Fathers, are Sons of the Gods, elsewhere Sons\r\nof Brahmâ and even Rishis, they are generally known as the Lunar\r\nAncestors.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Pitri‐Pati is the Lord or King of the Pitris, Yama, the God of Death\r\nand the Judge of mortals. The men of Budha, Mercury, are metaphorically\r\n“immortal” through their Wisdom. Such is the common belief of those who\r\ncredit every Star or Planet with being inhabited—and there are men of\r\nScience, M. Flammarion among others, who believe in this fervently, on\r\nlogical as well as on astronomical data. The Moon being an inferior\r\nbody—even to the Earth, to say nothing of other Planets, the terrestrial\r\nmen produced by her Sons—the Lunar Men or Ancestors—from her shell or\r\nbody, cannot be immortal. They cannot hope to become real, self‐conscious\r\nand intelligent men, unless they are “finished,” so to say, by other\r\ncreators. Thus in the Purânic legend, the son of the Moon (Soma) is Budha\r\n(Mercury), the intelligent and the wise, because he is the offspring of\r\nSoma, the Regent of the visible Moon, not of Indu, the physical Moon. Thus\r\nMercury is the elder brother of the Earth, metaphorically—his step‐\r\nbrother, so to say, the offspring of Spirit—while she (the Earth) is the\r\nprogeny of the Body. These allegories have a deeper and more scientific\r\nmeaning—astronomically and geologically—than our modern Physicists are\r\nwilling to admit. The whole cycle of the first “War in Heaven,” the\r\nTârakâ‐maya, is as full of philosophical as of cosmogonical and\r\nastronomical truths. One can trace therein the biographies of all the\r\nPlanets by the history of their Gods and Rulers. Ushanas (Shukra, or\r\nVenus), the bosom‐friend of Soma and the foe of Brihaspati (Jupiter), the\r\n“Instructor of the Gods,” whose wife Târâ, or Tarakâ, had been carried\r\naway by the Moon, Soma—“of whom he begat Budha”—took also an active part\r\nin this war against the “Gods” and forthwith was degraded into a Demon\r\n(Asura) Deity, and so he remains to this day.(85)\r\n\r\nHere the word “men” refers to the Celestial men, or what are called in\r\nIndia the Pitaras or Pitris, the Fathers, the Progenitors of men. This\r\ndoes not remove the seeming difficulty, in view of modern hypotheses, of\r\nthe teaching, which shows these Progenitors or Ancestors creating the\r\nfirst human Adams out of their sides, as astral shadows. And though it is\r\nan improvement on Adam’s rib, still geological and climatic difficulties\r\nwill be brought forward. Such, however, is the teaching of Occultism.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Man’s organism was adapted in every Race to its surroundings. The\r\nfirst Root‐Race was as ethereal as ours is material. The progeny of the\r\nSeven Creators, who evolved the Seven Primordial Adams,(86) surely\r\nrequired no purified gases to breathe and live upon. Therefore, however\r\nstrongly the impossibility of this teaching may be urged by the devotees\r\nof Modern Science, the Occultist maintains that the case was as stated\r\n_æons of years_ before even the evolution of the Lemurian, the first\r\nphysical man, which took place 18,000,000 years ago. Archaic Scripture\r\nteaches that at the commencement of every local Kalpa, or Round, the Earth\r\nis reborn, and preliminary evolution is described in one of the _Books of\r\nDzyan_ and the Commentaries thereon in this wise:\r\n\r\n“_As the human Jîva [Monad], when passing into a new womb, gets recovered\r\nwith a new body, so does the Jîva of the Earth; it gets a more perfect and\r\nsolid covering with each Round after reëmerging once more from the matrix\r\nof space into objectivity._”\r\n\r\nThis process is attended, of course, by the throes of the new birth, or\r\ngeological convulsions.\r\n\r\nThe only reference to it is contained in one verse of the volume of the\r\n_Book of Dzyan_ before us, where it says:\r\n\r\n4. AFTER GREAT THROES SHE(87) CAST OFF HER OLD THREE AND PUT ON HER NEW\r\nSEVEN SKINS, AND STOOD IN HER FIRST ONE.\r\n\r\nThis refers to the growth of the Earth, whereas in the Stanza treating of\r\nthe First Round it is said in the Commentary:\r\n\r\n“_After the changeless [Avikâra] immutable Nature [Essence, Sadaikarûpa]\r\nhad awakened and changed [differentiated] into [a state of] causality\r\n[Avyakta], and from cause [Kârana] had become its own discrete effect\r\n[Vyakta], from invisible it became visible. The smallest of the small [the\r\nmost atomic of atoms, or anîyânsam anîyasâm] became one and the many\r\n[Ekânekarûpa]; and producing the Universe produced also the fourth Loka\r\n[our Earth] in the garland of the seven lotuses. The Achyuta then became\r\nthe Chyuta._”(88)\r\n\r\nThe Earth is said to cast off “her old _three_” Skins, because this refers\r\nto the three preceding Rounds she has already passed through; the present\r\nbeing the Fourth Round out of the seven. At the beginning of every new\r\nRound, after a period of Obscuration, the Earth—as do also the other six\r\n“Earths”—casts off, or is supposed to cast off, her old Skins as the\r\nSerpent does; therefore she is called in the _Aitareya‐Brâhmana_ the\r\nSarpa‐Râjnî, the “Queen of the Serpents,” and “the mother of all that\r\nmoves.” The “Seven Skins,” in the first of which she now stands, refer to\r\nthe seven geological changes which accompany and correspond to the\r\nevolution of the Seven Root‐Races of Humanity.\r\n\r\nStanza II, which speaks of this Round, begins with a few words of\r\ninformation concerning the age of our Earth. The chronology will be given\r\nin its place. In the Commentary appended to the Stanza, two personages are\r\nmentioned, Nârada and Asuramaya, especially the latter. All the\r\ncalculations are attributed to this archaic celebrity; and what follows\r\nwill make the reader superficially acquainted with some of these figures.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo Antediluvian Astronomers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the mind of the Eastern student of Occultism, two figures are\r\nindissolubly connected with mystic Astronomy, Chronology, and their\r\ncycles. Two grand and mysterious figures, towering like two giants in the\r\nArchaic Past, emerge before him, whenever he has to refer to Yugas and\r\nKalpas. When, at what period of pre‐history they lived, none save a few\r\nmen in the world know, or ever can know, with that certainty which is\r\nrequired by exact chronology. It may have been 100,000 years ago, it may\r\nhave been 1,000,000, for all that the outside world will ever know. The\r\nmystic West and Freemasonry talk loudly of Enoch and Hermes. The mystic\r\nEast speaks of Nârada, the old Vedic Rishi, and of Asuramaya, the\r\nAtlantean.\r\n\r\nIt has already been hinted that of all the incomprehensible characters in\r\nthe _Mahâbhârata_ and the _Purânas_, Nârada, the son of Brahmâ in the\r\n_Matsya Purâna_, the progeny of Kashyapa and the daughter of Daksha, in\r\nthe _Vishnu Purâna_, is the most mysterious. He is referred to by the\r\nhonourable title of Deva‐Rishi (Divine Rishi, rather than Demi‐God) by\r\nParâshara, and yet he is cursed by Daksha and even by Brahmâ. He informs\r\nKansha that Bhagavân, or Vishnu in exotericism, would incarnate in the\r\neighth child of Devakî, and thus brings the wrath of the Indian Herod upon\r\nKrishna’s mother; and then, from the cloud on which he is seated—invisible\r\nas a true Mânasaputra—he lauds Krishna, in delight at the Avatâr’s feat of\r\nkilling the monster Keshin. Nârada is here, there, and everywhere; and\r\nyet, none of the _Purânas_ gives the true characteristics of this great\r\nenemy of physical procreation. Whatever those characteristics may be in\r\nHindû Esotericism, Nârada—who is called in Cis‐Himâlayan Occultism Pesh‐\r\nHun, the “Messenger,” or the Greek Angelos—is the sole confidant and the\r\nexecutor of the universal decrees of Karma and Adi‐Budha: a kind of active\r\nand ever‐incarnating Logos, who leads and guides human affairs from the\r\nbeginning to the end of the Kalpa.\r\n\r\nPesh‐Hun is a general not a special Hindû possession. He is the mysterious\r\nguiding intelligent power, which gives the impulse to, and regulates the\r\nimpetus of Cycles, Kalpas and universal events.(89) He is Karma’s visible\r\nadjuster on a general scale; the inspirer and the leader of the greatest\r\nheroes of this Manvantara. In the exoteric works he is referred to by some\r\nvery uncomplimentary names; such as Kali‐kâraka, Strife‐maker, Kapi‐\r\nvaktra, Monkey‐faced, and even Pishuna, the Spy, though elsewhere he is\r\ncalled Deva‐Brahmâ. Even Sir William Jones was strongly impressed with\r\nthis mysterious character from what he gathered in his Sanskrit studies.\r\nHe compares him to Hermes and Mercury, and calls him “the eloquent\r\nmessenger of the gods.”(90) All this, besides the fact that the Hindûs\r\nbelieve him to be a great Rishi, “who is for ever wandering about the\r\nearth, giving good counsel,” led the late Dr. Kenealy(91) to see in him\r\none of his twelve Messiahs. He was, perhaps, not so far off the real track\r\nas some imagine.\r\n\r\nWhat Nârada _really_ is, cannot be explained in print; nor would the\r\nmodern generations of the profane gather much from the information. But it\r\nmay be remarked, that if there be in the Hindû Pantheon a Deity which\r\nresembles Jehovah, in tempting by “suggestion” of thoughts, and\r\n“hardening” of the hearts of those whom he would make his tools and\r\nvictims, it is Nârada. Only with the latter it is no desire to obtain a\r\npretext for “plaguing,” and thus showing that “_I am_ the Lord God.” Nor\r\nis it through any ambitious or selfish motive; but, verily, to serve and\r\nguide universal progress and evolution.\r\n\r\nNârada is one of the few prominent characters, if we except some Gods, in\r\nthe _Purânas_, who visit the so‐called nether or infernal regions, Pâtâla.\r\nWhether or not it was from his intercourse with the thousand‐headed\r\nShesha, the Serpent who bears the Seven Pâtâlas and the entire world like\r\na diadem upon his heads, and who is the great teacher of Astronomy,(92)\r\nthat Nârada learned all that he knew, certain it is that he surpasses\r\nGarga’s Guru in his knowledge of cyclic intricacies. It is he who has\r\ncharge of our progress and national weal or woe. It is he who brings on\r\nwars and puts an end to them. In the old Stanzas, Pesh‐Hun is credited\r\nwith having calculated and recorded all the astronomical and cosmic Cycles\r\nto come, and with having taught the Science to the first gazers at the\r\nstarry vault. And it is Asuramaya, who is said to have based all his\r\nastronomical works upon those records, to have determined the duration of\r\nall the past geological and cosmical periods, and the length of all the\r\nCycles to come, till the end of this Life‐Cycle, or the end of the Seventh\r\nRace.\r\n\r\nThere is a work among the Secret Books, called the _Mirror of Futurity_,\r\nwherein all the Kalpas within Kalpas, and Cycles within the bosom of\r\nShesha, or infinite Time, are recorded. This work is ascribed to Pesh‐Hun‐\r\nNârada. There is another old work which is attributed to various\r\nAtlanteans. It is these two records which furnish us with the figures of\r\nour Cycles, and the possibility of calculating the date of Cycles to come.\r\nThe chronological calculations which will presently be given are, however,\r\nthose of the Brâhmans, as explained further on: but most of them are also\r\nthose of the Secret Doctrine.\r\n\r\nThe chronology and computations of the Brâhman Initiates are based upon\r\nthe zodiacal records of India, and the works of the above‐mentioned\r\nAstronomer and Magician—Asuramaya. The Atlantean zodiacal records cannot\r\nerr, as they were compiled under the guidance of those who first taught\r\nAstronomy, among other things, to mankind.\r\n\r\nBut here again we are deliberately and recklessly facing a new difficulty.\r\nWe shall be told that our statement is contradicted by Science, in the\r\nperson of a man regarded as a great authority (in the West) upon all\r\nsubjects of Sanskrit literature—Professor Albrecht Weber, of Berlin. This,\r\nto our great regret, cannot be helped; and we are ready to maintain what\r\nis now stated. Asuramaya, to whom the epic tradition points as the\r\nearliest Astronomer in Âryâvarta, one to whom “the Sun‐God imparted the\r\nknowledge of the stars,” _in propriâ personâ_, as Dr. Weber himself\r\nstates, is identified by him, in some very mysterious way, with the\r\n“Ptolemaios” of the Greeks. No more valid reason is given for this\r\nidentification than that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    This latter name (Ptolemaios), as we see from the inscription of\r\n    Piyadasi, became the Indian “Turamaya,” out of which the name\r\n    “Asura Maya” might very easily grow.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo doubt it “might,” but the vital question is: Are there any good proofs\r\nthat it _has_ thus grown? The only evidence that is given for this is,\r\nthat it _must_ be so:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Since ... this Maya is distinctly assigned to Romaka‐pura in the\r\n    West.(93)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mâyâ is evident, since no Sanskritist among Europeans can tell where\r\nthat locality of Romaka‐pura was, except, indeed, that it was somewhere\r\n“in the West.” In any case, as no member of the Asiatic Society, or\r\nWestern Orientalist, will ever listen to a Brâhmanical teaching, it is\r\nuseless to take the objections of European Orientalists into\r\nconsideration. Romaka‐pura was “in the West,” certainly, since it was part\r\nand parcel of the lost continent of Atlantis. And it is equally certain\r\nthat it is Atlantis, to which is assigned in the Hindû _Purânas_ the\r\nbirth‐place of Asuramaya, “as great a Magician as he was an Astrologer and\r\nan Astronomer.” Moreover, Prof. Weber refuses to assign any great\r\nantiquity to the Indian Zodiac, and feels inclined to think that the\r\nHindûs never knew of a Zodiac at all till\r\n\r\n\r\n    They had borrowed one from the Greeks.(94)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis statement clashes with the most ancient traditions of India, and must\r\ntherefore be ignored. We are the more justified in ignoring it, as the\r\nlearned German Professor himself tells us in the introduction to his work,\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In addition to the natural obstacles which impede investigation\r\n    [in India], there still prevails a dense mist of prejudice and\r\n    preconceived opinions hovering over the land, and enfolding it as\r\n    with a veil.(95)\r\n\r\n\r\nCaught in that veil, it is no wonder that Dr. Weber should himself have\r\nbeen led into involuntary errors. Let us hope that he knows better now.\r\n\r\nNow whether Asuramaya is to be considered a modern myth, a personage who\r\nflourished in the day of the Macedonian Greeks, or that which he is\r\nclaimed to be by the Occultists, in any case his calculations agree\r\nentirely with those of the Secret Records.\r\n\r\nFrom fragments of immensely old works attributed to the Atlantean\r\nAstronomer, and found in Southern India, the calendar elsewhere mentioned\r\nwas compiled by two very learned Brâhmans(96) in 1884 and 1885. The work\r\nis proclaimed by the best Pandits as faultless—from the Brâhmanical\r\nstandpoint—and thus far relates to the chronology of the orthodox\r\nteachings. If we compare its statements with those made several years\r\nearlier in _Isis Unveiled_, with the fragmentary teachings published by\r\nsome Theosophists, and with the present data derived from the Secret Books\r\nof Occultism, the whole will be found to agree perfectly, save in some\r\ndetails which may not be explained; for secrets of higher Initiation—as\r\nunknown to the writer as they are to the reader—would have to be revealed,\r\nand that _cannot be done_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStanza II. Nature Unaided Fails.\r\n\r\n\r\n    5. After enormous periods the Earth creates monsters. 6. The\r\n    “Creators” are displeased. 7. They dry the Earth. 8.

THE WHEEL WHIRLED FOR THIRTY CRORES MORE.(97) IT CONSTRUCTED RÛPAS;(98)\r\nSOFT STONES THAT HARDENED,(99) HARD PLANTS THAT SOFTENED.(100) VISIBLE\r\nFROM INVISIBLE, INSECTS AND SMALL LIVES.(101) SHE(102) SHOOK THEM OFF HER\r\nBACK WHENEVER THEY OVERRAN THE MOTHER (_A_).... AFTER THIRTY CRORES, SHE\r\nTURNED ROUND. SHE LAY ON HER BACK; ON HER SIDE.... SHE WOULD CALL NO SONS\r\nOF HEAVEN, SHE WOULD ASK NO SONS OF WISDOM. SHE CREATED FROM HER OWN\r\nBOSOM. SHE EVOLVED WATER‐MEN, TERRIBLE AND BAD (_B_).\r\n\r\n(_a_) This relates to an inclination of the axis—of which there were\r\nseveral—to a consequent deluge and chaos on Earth (having, however, no\r\nreference to Primeval Chaos), in which monsters, half‐human, half‐animal,\r\nwere generated. We find it mentioned in the _Book of the Dead_, and also\r\nin the Chaldæan account of creation, on the Cutha Tablets, however\r\nmutilated.\r\n\r\nIt is not even allegory. Here we have _facts_, that are found repeated in\r\nthe account of the _Pymander_, as well as in the Chaldæan tablets of\r\ncreation. The verses may almost be checked by the Cosmogony, as given by\r\nBerosus, which has been disfigured out of recognition by Eusebius, but\r\nsome of the features of which may yet be found in fragments left by\r\nancient Greek authors—Apollodorus, Alexander Polyhistor, etc. “The water‐\r\nmen terrible and bad”—who were the production of Physical Nature alone, a\r\nresult of the “evolutionary impulse” and the first attempt to create\r\n“man,” the crown, and the aim and goal of all animal life on Earth—are\r\nshown to be failures in our Stanzas. Do we not find the same in the\r\nBerosian Cosmogony, denounced with such vehemence as the culmination of\r\nheathen absurdity? And yet who of the Evolutionists can say that things in\r\nthe beginning have not come to pass as they are described? That, as\r\nmaintained in the _Purânas_, the Egyptian and Chaldæan fragments, and even\r\nin _Genesis_, there have not been two, and even more, “creations,” before\r\nthe last formation of the Globe; which, changing its geological and\r\natmospheric conditions, changed also its flora, its fauna, and its men?\r\nThis claim agrees not only with every ancient Cosmogony, but also with\r\nModern Science, and even, to a certain degree, with the theory of\r\nevolution, as may be demonstrated in a few words.\r\n\r\nThere is no “Dark Creation,” no “Evil Dragon” conquered by a Sun‐God, in\r\nthe earliest World‐Cosmogonies. Even with the Akkads, the Great Deep—the\r\nWatery Abyss, or Space—was the birthplace and abode of Ea, Wisdom, the\r\nincognizable infinite Deity. But with the Semites and the later Chaldæans,\r\nthe fathomless Deep of Wisdom becomes gross Matter, sinful substance, and\r\nEa is changed into Tiamat, the Dragon slain by Merodach, or Satan, in the\r\nastral waves.\r\n\r\nIn the Hindû _Purânas_, Brahmâ, the Creator, is seen recommencing _de\r\nnovo_ several “Creations” after as many failures; and two great Creations\r\nare mentioned,(103) the Pâdma and the Vârâha, the present, when the Earth\r\nwas lifted out of the water by Brahmâ, in the shape of a Boar, the Varâha\r\nAvatâra. Creation is shown as a sport, an amusement (Lîlâ) of the Creative\r\nGod. The _Zohar_ speaks of primordial worlds, which perished as soon as\r\nthey came into existence. And the same is said in the _Midraish_, Rabbi\r\nAbahu explaining distinctly(104) that “the Holy One” had successively\r\ncreated and destroyed sundry Worlds, before he succeeded in the present\r\none. This does not relate only to other Worlds in Space, but to a mystery\r\nof our own Globe contained in the allegory about the “Kings of Edom.” For\r\nthe words, “This one pleases me,” are repeated in _Genesis_,(105) though\r\nin disfigured terms, as usual. The Chaldæan fragments of Cosmogony in the\r\ncuneiform inscriptions, and elsewhere, show two distinct creations of\r\nanimals and men, the first being destroyed, as it was a failure. The\r\nCosmogonical tablets prove that this our actual creation was preceded by\r\nothers;(106) and as shown by the author of _The Qabbalah_, in the _Zohar_,\r\n_Siphra Dtzenioutha_, in _Jovah Rabba_, 128a, etc., the Kabalah states the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Oannes, or Dagon, the Chaldæan “Man‐fish,” divides his Cosmogony and\r\nGenesis into two portions. First the abyss of waters and darkness, wherein\r\nresided most hideous beings—men with wings, four and two‐winged men, human\r\nbeings with two heads, with the legs and horns of a goat—our “goat‐\r\nmen”(107)—hippocentaurs, bulls with the heads of men, and dogs with tails\r\nof fishes. In short, combinations of various animals and men, of fishes,\r\nreptiles and other monstrous animals, assuming each other’s shapes and\r\ncountenances. The feminine element they resided in is personified by\r\nThalatth—the Sea, or “Water”—which was finally conquered by Belus, the\r\nmale principle. And Polyhistor says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Belus came, and cut the woman asunder; and of one half of her he\r\n    formed the earth, and of the other half the heavens; and at the\r\n    same time destroyed the animals within her.(108)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs pertinently remarked by Isaac Myer:\r\n\r\n\r\n    With the Akkadians each object and power of Nature had its _Zi_ or\r\n    Spirit. The Akkadians formed their deities into triads, usually of\r\n    males [sexless, rather?], the Semites also had triadic deities,\r\n    but introduced sex(109)\r\n\r\n\r\n—or phallicism. With the Âryan and the earliest Akkadians all things are\r\nemanations _through_, not _by_, a Creator or Logos. With the Semites\r\neverything is _begotten_.\r\n\r\n6. THE WATER‐MEN, TERRIBLE AND BAD, SHE HERSELF CREATED FROM THE REMAINS\r\nOF OTHERS.(110) FROM THE DROSS AND SLIME OF HER FIRST, SECOND, AND\r\nTHIRD,(111) SHE FORMED THEM. THE DHYÂNI CAME AND LOOKED.... THE DHYÂNI\r\nFROM THE BRIGHT FATHER‐MOTHER, FROM THE WHITE(112) REGIONS THEY(113) CAME,\r\nFROM THE ABODES OF THE IMMORTAL MORTALS (_A_).\r\n\r\n(_a_) The explanations given in our Stanzas are far more clear than that\r\nwhich the legend of creation from the Cutha tablet would give, even were\r\nit complete. What is preserved on it, however, corroborates them. For, in\r\nthe tablet, the “Lord of Angels” destroys the men in the abyss, when\r\n“there were not left the carcases and waste” after they were slaughtered.\r\nAfter which they, the Great Gods, create men with the bodies of birds of\r\nthe desert, human beings, “seven kings, brothers of the same family,”\r\netc., which is a reference to the locomotive qualities of the primary\r\nethereal bodies of men, which could fly as well as they could walk,(114)\r\nbut who “were destroyed” because they were not “perfect,” _i.e._, they\r\n“were sexless, like the Kings of Edom.”\r\n\r\nWeeded of metaphors and allegories, what will Science say to this idea of\r\na primordial creation of species? It will object to the “Angels” and\r\n“Spirits” having anything to do therewith; but if it be Nature and the\r\nphysical law of evolution that are the creators of all there is now on\r\nEarth, why could there be “no such abyss,” when the Globe was covered with\r\nwaters, in which numbers of monstrous beings were generated? Is it the\r\n“human beings” and animals with human heads and double faces, which are a\r\npoint of the objection? But if man is only a higher animal and has evolved\r\nfrom the brute species by an infinite series of transformations, why could\r\nnot the “missing links” have had human heads attached to the bodies of\r\nanimals, or, being two‐headed, have heads of beasts and _vice versâ_, in\r\nNature’s early efforts? Are we not shown, during the geological periods,\r\nin the ages of the reptiles and the mammalia, lizards with birds’ wings,\r\nand serpents’ heads on animal bodies?(115) And, arguing from the\r\nstandpoint of Science, does not even our modern human race occasionally\r\nfurnish us with monster‐specimens: two‐headed children, animal bodies with\r\nhuman heads, dog‐headed babies, etc.? And this proves that, if Nature will\r\nstill play such freaks now that she has been settled for ages in the order\r\nof her evolutionary work, monsters, like those described by Berosus, were\r\na possibility in her opening programme; a possibility which may even have\r\nexisted once upon a time as a law, before she sorted out her species and\r\nbegan regular work upon them. And this indeed now admits of definite proof\r\nby the bare fact of “Reversion,” as Science puts it.\r\n\r\nThis is what the Doctrine teaches, and demonstrates by numerous proofs.\r\nBut we shall not wait for the approval of either dogmatic Theology or\r\nMaterialistic Science, but proceed with the Stanzas. Let these speak for\r\nthemselves, with the help of the light thrown on them by the Commentaries\r\nand their explanations; the scientific aspect of these questions will be\r\nconsidered later on.\r\n\r\nThus Physical Nature, when left to herself in the creation of animal and\r\nman, is shown to have failed. She can produce the first two kingdoms, as\r\nwell as that of the lower animals, but when it comes to the turn of man,\r\nspiritual, independent and intelligent powers are required for his\r\ncreation, besides the “coats of skin” and the “breath of animal life.” The\r\nhuman Monads of preceding Rounds need something higher than purely\r\nphysical materials with which to build their personalities, under the\r\npenalty of remaining even below any “Frankenstein” animal.(116)\r\n\r\n7. DISPLEASED THEY WERE. “OUR FLESH IS NOT THERE.(117) NO FIT RÛPAS FOR\r\nOUR BROTHERS OF THE FIFTH. NO DWELLINGS FOR THE LIVES.(118) PURE WATERS,\r\nNOT TURBID, THEY MUST DRINK (_A_). LET US DRY THEM.”(119)\r\n\r\n(_a_) Says the _Catechism_ on the Commentaries:\r\n\r\n_It is from the material Worlds that descend they, who fashion physical\r\nman at the new Manvantaras. They are inferior Lha [Spirits], possessed of\r\na dual body [an Astral within an Ethereal Form]. They are the fashioners\r\nand creators of our body of illusion_....\r\n\r\n_Into the forms projected by the Lha [Pitris] the Two Letters_(_120_)_\r\n[the Monad, called also the __“__Double Dragon__”__] descend from the\r\nSpheres of Expectation._(_121_)_ But they are like a roof with no walls,\r\nnor pillars to rest upon_....\r\n\r\n_Man needs four Flames and three Fires to become one on Earth, and he\r\nrequires the essence of the forty‐nine Fires_(_122_)_ to be perfect. It is\r\nthose who have deserted the Superior Spheres, the Gods of Will,_(_123_)_\r\nwho complete the Manu of illusion. For the __“__Double Dragon__”__ has no\r\nhold upon the mere form. It is like the breeze where there is no tree or\r\nbranch to receive and harbour it. It cannot affect the form where there is\r\nno agent of transmission [Manas, __“__Mind__”__] and the form knows it\r\nnot._\r\n\r\n_In the highest worlds, the three are one,_(_124_)_ on Earth [at first]\r\nthe one becomes two. They are like the two [side] lines of a triangle that\r\nhas lost its bottom line—which is the third Fire._(125)\r\n\r\nNow this requires some explanation before proceeding any further. To do so\r\nespecially for the benefit of our Âryan Hindû brethren—whose Esoteric\r\ninterpretations may differ from our own—we shall have to explain to them\r\nthe foregoing by certain passages in their own exoteric books, namely, the\r\n_Purânas_. In the allegories of the latter, Brahmâ, who is collectively\r\nthe Creative Force of the Universe, is thus described:\r\n\r\n\r\n    At the beginning of the Yugas [Cycles] ... possessed of the desire\r\n    and of the power to create, and impelled by the potencies of what\r\n    is to be created, again and again does he, at the outset of a\r\n    Kalpa, put forth a similar creation.(126)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is now proposed to examine the exoteric account in the _Vishnu Purâna_,\r\nand see how much it may agree or disagree with our Occult version.\r\n\r\n\r\nCreation of Divine Beings in the Exoteric Accounts.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the _Vishnu Purâna_, which is certainly the earliest of all the\r\nscriptures of that name, we find, as in all the others, Brahmâ, as the\r\nmale God, assuming, for purposes of creation, “_four_ Bodies invested by\r\n_three_ qualities.”(127) It is said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In this manner, Maitreya, Jyotsnâ (dawn), Râtri (night), Ahan\r\n    (day), and Sandhyâ (evening [twilight]) are the four bodies of\r\n    Brahmâ.(128)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Parâshara explains it, when Brahmâ wishes to create the world anew and\r\nconstruct progeny _through his will_, in the fourfold condition, or the\r\nfour Orders of Beings, termed Gods (Dhyân Chohans), Demons(129) (_i.e._,\r\nmore material Devas), Progenitors (Pitris) and Men, “he collects [Yoga‐\r\nlike] his mind into itself” (Yûyuge).\r\n\r\nStrange to say, he begins by creating Demons, who thus take precedence\r\nover the Angels or Gods. This is no incongruity, nor is it due to\r\ninconsistency, but has, like all the rest, a profound Esoteric meaning,\r\nquite clear to one free from Christian theological prejudice. He who bears\r\nin mind that the principle Mahat, or Intellect, the “Universal Mind”\r\n(literally the “Great”), which Esoteric Philosophy explains as the\r\n“Manifested Omniscience”—the “first product” of Pradhâna, Primordial\r\nMatter, as the _Vishnu Purâna_ says, but the first Cosmic Aspect of\r\nParabrahman or the Esoteric Sat, the Universal Soul,(130) as Occultism\r\nteaches—is at the root of SELF‐Consciousness, will understand the reason\r\nwhy. The so‐called Demons—who are Esoterically the Self‐asserting and\r\nintellectually active Principle—are the _positive pole of creation_, so to\r\nsay; hence, the first produced. This is in brief the process as narrated\r\nallegorically in the _Purânas_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Having concentrated his mind into itself and the Quality of\r\n    Darkness pervading Brahmâ’s assumed body, the Asuras, issuing from\r\n    his Thigh, were first produced; after which, abandoning this body,\r\n    it was transformed into Night.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo important points are involved herein: (_a_) Primarily in the _Rig\r\nVeda_, the Asuras are shown as _spiritual divine Beings_; their etymology\r\nis derived from Asu, breath, the “Breath of God,” and they mean the same\r\nas the Supreme Spirit or the Zoroastrian Ahura. It is later on, for\r\npurposes of theology and dogma, that they are shown issuing from Brahmâ’s\r\nThigh, and that their name began to be derived from _a_, privative, and\r\n_Sura_, a God, or “not‐a‐God,” and that they became the enemies of the\r\nGods. (_b_) Every ancient Theogony without exception—from the Aryan and\r\nthe Egyptian down to that of Hesiod—in the order of Cosmogonical\r\nevolution, places Night before Day; even _Genesis_, where “darkness is\r\nupon the face of the deep” before the “first day.” The reason for this is\r\nthat every Cosmogony—except in the Secret Doctrine—begins by the\r\n“Secondary Creation” so‐called; to wit, the _Manifested_ Universe, the\r\nGenesis of which has to begin by a marked differentiation between the\r\neternal Light of “Primary Creation,” whose mystery must remain for ever\r\n“Darkness” to the prying finite conception and intellect of the profane,\r\nand the Secondary Evolution of manifested visible Nature. The _Veda_\r\ncontains the whole philosophy of that division, without having ever been\r\ncorrectly explained by our Orientalists, since it has _never been\r\nunderstood_ by them.\r\n\r\nContinuing to create, Brahmâ assumes another form, that of the Day, and\r\ncreates from his Breath the Gods, who are endowed with the Quality of\r\nGoodness (Passivity).(131) In his next body the Quality of great Passivity\r\nprevailed, which is also (negative) goodness, and from the side of that\r\npersonage issued the Pitris, the Progenitors of men, because, as the text\r\nexplains, Brahmâ “thought of himself [during the process] as the father of\r\nthe world.”(132) This is Kriyâ‐shakti—the mysterious Yoga‐power explained\r\nelsewhere. This body of Brahmâ when cast off became the Sandhyâ, Evening\r\nTwilight, the interval between Day and Night.\r\n\r\nFinally Brahmâ assumed his last form pervaded by the Quality of Foulness.\r\n\r\n\r\n    And from this, Men, in whom foulness (or passion) predominates,\r\n    were produced.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis body when cast off became the Dawn, or Morning Twilight—the Twilight\r\nof Humanity. Here Brahmâ stands Esoterically for the Pitris. He is\r\ncollectively the Pitâ, “Father.”\r\n\r\nThe true Esoteric meaning of this allegory must now be explained. Brahmâ\r\nhere symbolizes personally the Collective Creators of the World and\r\nMen—the Universe with all its numberless productions of things movable and\r\n(seemingly) immovable.(133) He is collectively the Prajâpatis, the Lords\r\nof Being; and the four bodies typify the four Classes of Creative Powers\r\nor Dhyân Chohans, described in the Commentary on Shloka I, Stanza VII, in\r\nVolume I. The whole philosophy of the so‐called “Creation” of the good and\r\nevil in this World, and of the whole Cycle of Manvantaric results\r\ntherefrom, hangs on the correct comprehension of these Four Bodies of\r\nBrahmâ.\r\n\r\nThe reader will now be prepared to understand the real, the Esoteric\r\nsignificance of what follows. Moreover there is an important point to be\r\ncleared up. Christian Theology having arbitrarily settled and agreed that\r\nSatan with his Fallen Angels belonged to the earliest creation, Satan\r\nbeing the first‐created, the wisest and most beautiful of God’s\r\nArchangels, the word was given, the key‐note struck. Henceforth all the\r\nPagan Scriptures were made to yield the same meaning, and all were shown\r\nto be demoniacal, and it _was_ and _is_ claimed that _truth and fact_\r\nbelong to, and commence only with, Christianity. Even the Orientalists and\r\nMythologists, some of them no Christians at all but “infidels,” or men of\r\nScience, entered, unconsciously to themselves and by the mere force of\r\nassociation of ideas and habit, into the theological groove.\r\n\r\nPurely Brâhmanical considerations, based on greed of power and ambition,\r\nallowed the masses to remain in ignorance of great truths; and the same\r\ncauses led the Initiates among the early Christians to remain silent,\r\nwhile those who had never known the truth disfigured the order of things,\r\njudging of the Hierarchy of “Angels” by their exoteric form. Thus, as the\r\nAsuras had become the rebellious inferior Gods fighting the higher ones in\r\npopular creeds, so the highest Archangel, in truth the Agathodæmon, the\r\neldest benevolent Logos, became in theology the “Adversary” or Satan. But\r\nis this warranted by the correct interpretation of any old Scripture? The\r\nanswer is: most certainly not. As the Mazdean Scriptures of the _Zend\r\nAvesta_, the _Vendidâd_ and others correct and expose the later cunning\r\nshuffling of the Gods in the Hindû Pantheon, and restore through Ahura the\r\nAsuras to their legitimate place in Theogony, so the recent discoveries of\r\nthe Chaldæan tablets vindicate the good name of the first divine\r\nEmanations. This is easily proved. Christian Angelology is directly and\r\nsolely derived from that of the Pharisees, who brought their tenets from\r\nBabylonia. The Sadducees, the real guardians of the Laws of Moses, knew\r\nnot of any Angels, opposing even the immortality of the human Soul (not\r\nthe impersonal Spirit). In the _Bible_ the only Angels spoken of are the\r\n“Sons of God” mentioned in _Genesis_ vi—who are now regarded as the\r\nNephilim, the Fallen Angels—and several Angels in human form, the\r\n“Messengers” of the Jewish God, whose own rank needs a closer analysis\r\nthan heretofore given. As shown above, the early Akkadians called Ea\r\nWisdom, which was disfigured by the later Chaldees and Semites into\r\nTiamat, Tisalat and the Thalatth of Berosus, the female Sea Dragon, now\r\nSatan. Truly—“How art thou fallen [by the hand of man], O bright Star and\r\nSon of the Morning”!\r\n\r\nNow what do the Babylonian accounts of “Creation,” as found on the\r\nAssyrian fragments of tiles, tell us; those very accounts upon which the\r\nPharisees built their Angelology? Compare Mr. George Smith’s _Assyrian\r\nDiscoveries_,(134) and his _Chaldean Account of Genesis_.(135) The Tablet\r\nwith the story of the Seven Wicked Gods or Spirits, has the following\r\naccount; we print the important passages in italics:\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. In the _first days_ the evil Gods,\r\n\r\n    2. the _angels who were in rebellion_, who _in the lower part of\r\n    heaven_\r\n\r\n    3. _had been created_,\r\n\r\n    4. they caused their evil work\r\n\r\n    5. devising with wicked heads ... etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus we are shown, as plainly as can be, on a fragment which remained\r\nunbroken, so that there can be no dubious reading, that the “Rebellious\r\nAngels” had been created in the “lower part of heaven,” _i.e._, that they\r\nbelonged and do belong to a _material plane of evolution_, although as it\r\nis not the plane of which we are made cognizant through our senses, it\r\nremains generally invisible to us, and is thus regarded as subjective.\r\nWere the Gnostics so wrong, after this, in affirming that this our Visible\r\nWorld, and especially the Earth, had been created by _Lower_ Angels, the\r\ninferior Elohim, of which, as they taught, the God of Israel was one?\r\nThese Gnostics were nearer in time to the records of the Archaic Secret\r\nDoctrine, and therefore ought to be allowed to have known what it\r\ncontained better than non‐initiated Christians, who took upon themselves,\r\nhundreds of years later, to remodel and _correct_ what was said. But let\r\nus see what the same Tablet says further on:\r\n\r\n\r\n    7. There were seven of them [the wicked gods].\r\n\r\n\r\nThen follows the description of these, the fourth being a “serpent,” the\r\nphallic symbol of the Fourth Race in human Evolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n    15. The seven of them, messengers of the God Anu their king.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow Anu belongs to the Chaldæan Trinity, and is identical with Sin, the\r\n“Moon,” in one aspect. And the Moon in the Hebrew Kabalah is the Argha of\r\nthe seed of all material life, and is still more closely connected,\r\nkabalistically, with Jehovah, who is double‐sexed, as Anu is. They are\r\nboth represented in Esotericism, and viewed, from a dual aspect: male or\r\nspiritual, female or material, or Spirit and Matter, the two antagonistic\r\nprinciples. Hence the “Messengers of Anu,” who is Sin, the “Moon,” are\r\nshown, in lines 28 to 41, as being finally overpowered by the same Sin\r\nwith the help of Bel, the Sun, and Ishtar, Venus. This is regarded as a\r\ncontradiction by the Assyriologists, but it is simply _metaphysics_ in the\r\nEsoteric teaching.\r\n\r\nThere is more than one interpretation, for there are seven keys to the\r\nmystery of the “Fall.” Moreover there are two “Falls” in Theology: the\r\nrebellion of the Archangels and their “Fall,” and the “Fall” of Adam and\r\nEve. Thus the lower as well as the higher Hierarchies are charged with a\r\nsupposed crime. The word “supposed” is the true and correct term, for in\r\nboth cases it is founded on misconception. Both are considered in\r\nOccultism as Karmic effects, and both belong to the law of\r\nEvolution—intellectual and spiritual on the one hand, physical and psychic\r\non the other. The “Fall” is a universal allegory. It sets forth at one end\r\nof the ladder of Evolution the “rebellion,” _i.e._, the action of\r\ndifferentiating intellection, or consciousness, on its various planes,\r\nseeking union with Matter; and at the other, the lower end, the rebellion\r\nof Matter against Spirit, or of action against spiritual inertia. And here\r\nlies the germ of an error which has had such disastrous effects on the\r\nintelligence of civilized societies for over 1,800 years. In the original\r\nallegory it is Matter—hence the more material Angels—which was regarded as\r\nthe conqueror of Spirit, or the Archangels who “fell” on this plane.\r\n\r\n\r\n    They of the _flaming sword_ [or animal passions] had put to flight\r\n    the Spirits of Darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\nYet it is the latter who fought for the supremacy of the conscious and\r\ndivine spirituality on Earth and failed, succumbing to the power of\r\nMatter. But in theological dogma we see the reverse. It is Michael, “who\r\nis like unto God,” the representative of Jehovah, who is the Leader of the\r\nCelestial Hosts—as Lucifer, in Milton’s fancy, is of the Infernal\r\nHosts—who has the best of Satan. It is true that the nature of Michael\r\ndepends upon that of his Creator and Master. Who the latter is, one may\r\nfind out by carefully studying the allegory of the “War in Heaven” with\r\nthe astronomical key. As shown by Bentley, the “War of the Titans against\r\nthe Gods” in Hesiod, and also the War of the Asuras, or the Târakâmaya,\r\nagainst the Devas in Purânic legend, are identical in all save the names.\r\nThe aspects of the stars show—Bentley taking the year 945 B.C. as the\r\nnearest date for such conjunction—that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    All the planets, except Saturn, were on the same side of the\r\n    heavens as the Sun and Moon.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd hence were his opponents. And yet it is Saturn, or the Jewish “Moon‐\r\nGod,” who is shown as prevailing, both by Hesiod and Moses, neither of\r\nwhom was understood. Thus it was that the real meaning became distorted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStanza II.—_Continued._\r\n\r\n\r\n8. THE FLAMES CAME. THE FIRES WITH THE SPARKS; THE NIGHT‐FIRES AND THE\r\nDAY‐FIRES (_A_). THEY DRIED OUT THE TURBID DARK WATERS. WITH THEIR HEAT\r\nTHEY QUENCHED THEM. THE LHAS(136) OF THE HIGH; THE LHAMAYIN(137) OF BELOW,\r\nCAME (_B_). THEY SLEW THE FORMS, WHICH WERE TWO‐ AND FOUR‐FACED. THEY\r\nFOUGHT THE GOAT‐MEN, AND THE DOG‐HEADED MEN, AND THE MEN WITH FISHES’\r\nBODIES.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The “Flames” are a Hierarchy of Spirits parallel to, if not\r\nidentical with, the “burning” fiery Saraph (Seraphim), mentioned by\r\nIsaiah(138) those who, according to Hebrew Theogony, attend the “Throne of\r\nthe Almighty.” Melha is the Lord of the “Flames.” When he appears on\r\nEarth, he assumes the personality of a Buddha, says a popular legend. He\r\nis one of the most ancient and revered Lhas, a Buddhist St. Michael.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The word “Below” must not be taken to mean Infernal Regions, but\r\nsimply a spiritual, or rather ethereal, Being of a lower grade, because\r\nnearer to the Earth, or one step higher than our Terrestrial Sphere; while\r\nthe Lhas are Spirits of the highest Spheres—whence the name of the capital\r\nof Tibet, Lha‐ssa.\r\n\r\nBesides a statement of a purely physical nature and belonging to the\r\nevolution of life on Earth, there may be another allegorical meaning\r\nattached to this shloka, or indeed, as is taught, several. The “Flames,”\r\nor “Fires,” represent Spirit, or the male element, and “Water,” Matter, or\r\nthe opposite element. And here again we find, in the action of the Spirit\r\nslaying the purely material form, a reference to the eternal struggle, on\r\nthe physical and psychic planes, between Spirit and Matter, besides a\r\nscientific cosmic fact. For, as said in the next verse:\r\n\r\n9. MOTHER‐WATER, THE GREAT SEA, WEPT. SHE AROSE, SHE DISAPPEARED IN THE\r\nMOON, WHICH HAD LIFTED HER, WHICH HAD GIVEN HER BIRTH.\r\n\r\nNow what can this mean? Is it not an evident reference to tidal action in\r\nthe early stage of the history of our Planet in its Fourth Round? Modern\r\nresearch has been busy of late in its speculations on the Palæozoic high‐\r\ntides. Mr. G. H. Darwin’s theory was that not less than 52,000,000 years\r\nago—and probably much more—the Moon originated from the Earth’s plastic\r\nmass. Starting from the point where research was left by Helmholtz,\r\nFerrel, Sir William Thomson and others, he retraced the course of tidal\r\nretardation of the Earth’s rotary motions far back into the very night of\r\ntime, and placed the Moon during the infancy of our Planet at only “a\r\nfraction of its present distance.” In short, his theory was that it was\r\nthe Moon which separated from the Earth. The tidal elevation concurring\r\nwith the swing of the globular mass—centrifugal tendency being then nearly\r\nequal to gravity—the latter was overcome, and the tidally elevated mass\r\ncould thus separate completely from the Earth.(139)\r\n\r\nThe Occult teaching is the reverse of this. The Moon is far older than the\r\nEarth; and, as explained in Volume I, it is the latter which owes its\r\nbeing to the former, however Astronomy and Geology may explain the fact.\r\nHence, the tides and the attraction to the Moon, as shown by the liquid\r\nportion of the Globe ever striving to raise itself towards its parent.\r\nThis is the meaning of the sentence that the Mother‐Water “arose, she\r\ndisappeared in the Moon, which had lifted her, which had given her birth.”\r\n\r\n10. WHEN(140) THEY WERE DESTROYED, MOTHER EARTH REMAINED BARE.(141) SHE\r\nASKED TO BE DRIED.(142)\r\n\r\nThe time for the Earth’s incrustation had arrived. The waters had\r\nseparated and the process was started. It was the beginning of a new life.\r\nThis is what one key divulges to us. Another key teaches the origin of\r\nWater, its admixture with Fire—“Liquid Fire” it calls it—and enters upon\r\nan Alchemical description of the progeny of the two—solid matters such as\r\nminerals and earths. From the “Waters of Space,” the progeny of the male\r\nSpirit‐Fire and the female (gaseous) Water has become the Oceanic expanse\r\non Earth. Varuna is dragged down from the infinite Space, to reign as\r\nNeptune over the finite Seas. As always, the popular fancy is found to be\r\nbased on a strictly scientific foundation.\r\n\r\nWater is the symbol of the Female Element everywhere; Mater, from which\r\ncomes the letter M, is derived pictorially from [Symbol like three\r\nmountains, rather like the letter “M”], a water hieroglyph. It is the\r\nUniversal Matrix or the “Great Deep.” Venus, the great Mother‐Virgin,\r\nissues forth from the sea‐wave, and Cupid or Erôs is her son. But Venus is\r\nthe later mythological variant of Gæa, Gaia, the Earth, which, in its\r\nhigher aspect is Prakriti, Nature, and metaphysically Aditi, and even\r\nMûlaprakriti, the Root of Prakriti, or its noumenon.\r\n\r\nHence Cupid or Love in his primitive sense is Erôs, the Divine Will, or\r\nDesire of manifesting itself through visible creation. Thence Fohat, the\r\nprototype of Erôs, becomes on Earth the Great Power “Life‐Electricity,” or\r\nthe Spirit of “Life‐giving.” Let us remember the Greek Theogony and enter\r\ninto the spirit of its Philosophy. We are taught by the Greeks that all\r\nthings, Gods included, owe their being to the Ocean and his wife Tethys,\r\nthe latter being Gæa, the Earth or Nature. But who is Ocean? Ocean is the\r\nimmeasurable Space—Spirit in Chaos—which, is the Deity; and Tethys is not\r\nthe Earth, but Primordial Matter in the process of formation. In our case\r\nit is no longer Aditi‐Gæa who begets Ouranos or Varuna, the chief Âditya\r\namong the seven Planetary Gods, but Prakriti, materialized and localized.\r\nThe Moon, masculine in its theogonic character, is, in its cosmic aspect\r\nonly, the female generative principle, as the Sun is the male emblem\r\nthereof. Water is the progeny of the Moon, an androgyne deity with every\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nEvolution proceeds on the laws of analogy in Kosmos as in the formation of\r\nthe smallest Globe. Thus the above, applying to the _modus operandi_ at\r\nthe time when the Universe was appearing, applies also in the case of our\r\nEarth’s formation.\r\n\r\nThe Stanza now being commented upon opens by speaking of thirty crores,\r\n300,000,000 of years. We may be asked: What could the ancients know of the\r\nduration of geological periods, when no modern Scientist or Mathematician\r\nis able to calculate their duration with anything like approximate\r\naccuracy? Whether they had or had not better means—and it is maintained\r\nthat they had them as is evidenced by their Zodiacs—still the chronology\r\nof the ancient Brâhmans shall now be given as faithfully as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chronology of the Brâhmans.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo greater riddle exists in Science, no problem is more hopelessly\r\ninsoluble, than the question: How old—even approximately—are the Sun and\r\nMoon, the Earth and Man? What does Modern Science know of the duration of\r\nthe Ages of the World, or even of the length of Geological Periods?\r\n\r\nNothing; absolutely nothing.\r\n\r\nIf one turns to Science for chronological information, one is told by\r\nthose who are straightforward and truthful, as for instance Mr. Pengelly,\r\nthe eminent Geologist, “We do not know.”(143) One will learn that, so far,\r\nno trustworthy numerical estimate of the ages of the World and Man could\r\nbe made, and that both Geology and Anthropology are at sea. Yet when a\r\nstudent of Esoteric Philosophy presumes to bring forward the teachings of\r\nOccult Science, he is at once sat upon. Why should this be so, since, when\r\nreduced to their own physical methods, the greatest Scientists have failed\r\nto arrive even at an approximate agreement?\r\n\r\nIt is true that Science can hardly be blamed for it. Indeed, in the\r\nCimmerian darkness of the prehistoric ages, the explorers are lost in a\r\nlabyrinth, whose great corridors are doorless, allowing no visible exit\r\ninto the archaic past. Lost in the maze of their own conflicting\r\nspeculations, rejecting, as they have always done, the evidence of Eastern\r\ntradition, without any clue, or one single certain milestone to guide\r\nthem, what can Geologists or Anthropologists do but pick up the slender\r\nthread of Ariadne where they first perceive it, and then proceed at\r\nperfect random? Therefore we are first told that the farthest date to\r\nwhich documentary record extends is now generally regarded by Anthropology\r\nas but “the earliest distinctly visible point of the pre‐historic\r\nperiod”—in the words of the writer of the article in the _Encyclopædia\r\nBritannica_.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it is confessed that “beyond that period stretches back a\r\nvast indefinite series of pre‐historic ages.”\r\n\r\nIt is with those specified “ages” that we shall begin. They are “pre‐\r\nhistoric” to the naked eye of Matter only. To the spiritual eagle eye of\r\nthe Seer and the Prophet of every race, Ariadne’s thread stretches beyond\r\nthat “historic period” without break or flaw, surely and steadily, into\r\nthe very night of time; and the hand which holds it is too mighty to drop\r\nit, or even let it break. Records exist, although they may be rejected as\r\nfanciful by the profane; though, indeed, many of them are tacitly accepted\r\nby Philosophers and men of great learning, and meet with an unvarying\r\nrefusal only from the official and collective body of _orthodox_ Science.\r\nAnd since the latter refuses to give us even an approximate idea of the\r\nduration of the geological Ages—save in a few conflicting and\r\ncontradictory hypotheses—let us see what Âryan Philosophy can teach us.\r\n\r\nSuch computations as are given in _Manu_ and the _Purânas_—save trifling\r\nand most evidently _intentional_ exaggerations—are, as already stated,\r\nalmost identical with those taught in Esoteric Philosophy. This may be\r\nseen by comparing the two in any Hindû calendar of recognized orthodoxy.\r\n\r\nThe best and most complete of all such calendars, at present, as vouched\r\nfor by the learned Brâhmans of Southern India, is the already mentioned\r\nTamil calendar called the _Tirukkanda Panchanga_, compiled, as we are\r\ntold, from, and in full accordance with, secret fragments of Asuramaya’s\r\ndata. As Asuramaya is said to have been the greatest Astronomer, so he is\r\nwhispered to have also been the most powerful “Sorcerer” of the “White\r\nIsland, which had become Black with sin,” _i.e._, of the islands of\r\nAtlantis.\r\n\r\nThe “White Island” is a symbolical name. Asuramaya is said to have lived,\r\nas in the tradition of the _Jñâna‐bhâskara_, in Romaka‐pura, in the West;\r\nbecause the name is an allusion to the land and cradle of the “Sweat‐born”\r\nof the Third Race. That land or continent had disappeared ages before\r\nAsuramaya lived, since he was an Atlantean; but he was a direct descendant\r\nof the Wise Race, _the Race that never dies_. Many are the legends\r\nconcerning this hero, the pupil of Sûrya, the Sun‐God, himself, as the\r\nIndian accounts allege. It matters little whether he lived on one or\r\nanother island, but the question is to prove that he was no myth, as Dr.\r\nWeber and others would make him. The fact of Romaka‐pura, in the West,\r\nbeing named as the birthplace of this hero of the Archaic Ages, is the\r\nmore interesting because it is so very suggestive of the Esoteric Teaching\r\nabout the Sweat‐born Races, the men born from the “pores of their\r\nparents.” “_Roma‐kûpas_” mean “hair‐pores” in Sanskrit. In the\r\n_Mahâbhârata_,(144) a people named Raumas are said to have been created\r\nfrom the pores of Vîrabhadra, the terrible giant, who destroyed Daksha’s\r\nsacrifice. Other tribes and people are also represented as born in this\r\nway. All these are references to the later Second and the earlier Third\r\nRoot‐Races.\r\n\r\nThe following figures are from the calendar just referred to; a foot‐note\r\nmarks the points of disagreement with the figures of the Ârya Samâj\r\nschool:\r\n\r\nI. From the beginning of Cosmic Evolution,(145) up to the Hindû year\r\nTarana (or 1887), 1,955,884,687 years.\r\n\r\nII. The (astral), mineral, vegetable and animal kingdoms up to Man, have\r\ntaken to evolve, 300,000,000 years.(146)\r\n\r\nIII. Time, from the first appearance of “Humanity” (on our Planetary\r\nChain), 1,664,500,987 years.(147)\r\n\r\nIV. The number that elapsed since the Vaivasvata, Manvantara(148)—or the\r\n_Human_ Period—up to the year 1887, is just 18,618,728 years.\r\n\r\nV. The full period of one Manvantara is 308,448,000 years.\r\n\r\nVI. Fourteen Manvantaras, _plus_ the period of one Satya Yuga make one Day\r\nof Brahmâ, or a complete Manvantara, or 4,320,000,000 years.\r\n\r\nTherefore a Mahâ Yuga consists of 4,320,000 years.(149)\r\n\r\nThe year 1887 is from the commencement of Kali Yuga, 4,989 years.\r\n\r\nTo make this still clearer in its details, the following computations by\r\nRao Bahadur P. Sreenivas Row, are given from the _Theosophist_ of\r\nNovember, 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\n    360 days of mortals make a year\r\n\r\n    Krita Yuga contains 1,728,000\r\n\r\n    Tretâ Yuga contains 1,296,000\r\n\r\n    Dvâpara Yuga contains 864,000\r\n\r\n    Kali Yuga contains 432,000\r\n\r\n    The total of the said four Yugas constitute a Mahâ Yuga, 4,320,000\r\n\r\n    Seventy‐one of such Mahâ Yugas form the period of the reign of one\r\n    Manu, 306,720,000\r\n\r\n    The reign of fourteen Manus embraces the duration of 994 Mahâ\r\n    Yugas, which is equal to 4,294,080,000\r\n\r\n    Add Sandhis, _i.e._, intervals between the reign of each Manu,\r\n    which amount to six Mahâ Yugas, equal to 25,920,000\r\n\r\n    The total of these reigns and interregnums of fourteen Manus, is\r\n    1,000 Mahâ Yugas, which constitute a Kalpa, _i.e._, one Day of\r\n    Brahmâ, 4,320,000,000\r\n\r\n    As Brahmâ’s Night is of equal duration, one Day and Night of\r\n    Brahmâ would contain 8,640,000,000\r\n\r\n    360 of such days and nights make one Year of Brahmâ equal to\r\n    3,110,400,000,000\r\n\r\n    100 such Years constitute the whole period of Brahmâ’s Age,\r\n    _i.e._, Mahâ Kalpa, 311,040,000,000,000\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are the exoteric figures accepted throughout India, and they\r\ndovetail pretty nearly with those of the Secret Works. The latter,\r\nmoreover, amplify them by a division into a number of Esoteric Cycles,\r\nnever mentioned in Brâhmanical popular writings—one of which, the division\r\nof the Yugas into Racial Cycles, is given elsewhere as an instance. The\r\nrest, in their details, have of course never been made public. They are,\r\nnevertheless, known to every “Twice‐born” (Dvija, or Initiated) Brâhman,\r\nand the _Purânas_ contain references to some of them in veiled terms,\r\nwhich no matter‐of‐fact Orientalist has yet endeavoured to make out, nor\r\ncould he if he would.\r\n\r\nThese sacred Astronomical Cycles are of immense antiquity, and most of\r\nthem pertain, as stated, to the calculations of Nârada and Asuramaya. The\r\nlatter has the reputation of a Giant and a Sorcerer. But the Antediluvian\r\nGiants—the Gibborim of the Bible—were not all bad or Sorcerers, as\r\nChristian Theology, which sees in every Occultist a servant of the Evil\r\nOne, would have it; nor were they worse than many of “the faithful sons of\r\nthe Church.” A Torquemada and a Catherine de Médicis certainly did more\r\nharm in their day, and in the name of their Master, than any Atlantean\r\nGiant or Demigod of antiquity ever did, whether named Cyclops, or Medusa,\r\nor yet the Orphic Titan, the anguipedal monster known as Ephialtes. There\r\nwere _good_ “giants” in days of old just as there are _bad_ “pigmies” now;\r\nand the Râkshasas and Yakshas of Lankâ are no worse than our modern\r\ndynamiters, and certain Christian and civilized generals during modern\r\nwars. Nor are they myths.\r\n\r\n\r\n    He who would laugh at Briareus and Orion ought to abstain from\r\n    going to, or even talking of, Carnac or Stonehenge.\r\n\r\n\r\nremarks somewhere a modern writer.\r\n\r\nAs the Brâhmanical figures given above are approximately the basic\r\ncalculations of our Esoteric System, the reader is requested to carefully\r\nkeep them in mind.\r\n\r\nIn the _Encyclopædia Britannica_ we find, as the last word of Science,\r\nthat the antiquity of man is allowed to stretch _only over_ “tens of\r\nthousands of years.” It becomes evident that as these figures may be made\r\nto fluctuate between 10,000 and 100,000, therefore they mean very little\r\nif anything, and only render still denser the darkness surrounding the\r\nquestion. Moreover, what matters it that Science places the birth of man\r\nin the “pre‐ or post‐ glacial drift,” if we are told at the same time that\r\nthe so‐called “Ice Age” is simply a long succession of ages which\r\n\r\n\r\n    Shaded without abrupt change of any kind into what is termed the\r\n    human or recent period ... the overlapping of geological periods\r\n    having been the rule from the beginning of time.(150)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe latter “rule” only results in the still more puzzling, even if\r\nstrictly scientific and correct, information, that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Even to‐day man is contemporary with the ice‐age in the Alpine\r\n    valleys and in the Finmark.(151)\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, had it not been for the lessons taught by the Secret Doctrine, and\r\neven by exoteric Hindûism and its traditions, we should to this day be\r\nleft to float in perplexed uncertainty between the indefinite “Ages” of\r\none school of Science, the “tens of thousands” of years of the other, and\r\nthe 6,000 years of the Bible interpreters. This is one of the several\r\nreasons why, with all the respect due to the conclusions of the men of\r\nlearning of our modern day, we are forced to ignore them in all such\r\nquestions of pre‐historic antiquity.\r\n\r\nModern Geology and Anthropology must, of course, disagree with our views.\r\nBut Occultism will find as many weapons against these two Sciences as it\r\nhas against astronomical and physical theories, in spite of Mr. Laing’s\r\nassurances that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In [chronological] calculations of this sort, concerning older and\r\n    later formations, there is no _theory_, they are based on positive\r\n    facts, limited only by a certain possible [?] amount of error\r\n    either way.(152)\r\n\r\n\r\nOccultism will prove, scientific confessions in hand, that Geology is very\r\nmuch in error, and very often even more so than Astronomy. In this very\r\npassage by Mr. Laing, which gives to Geology preëminence for correctness\r\nover Astronomy, we find a passage in flagrant contradiction to the\r\nadmissions of the best Geologists themselves. Says the author:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In short, the conclusions of Geology, at any rate up to the\r\n    Silurian period(153) when the present order of things was fairly\r\n    inaugurated, are approximate [truly so] _facts_ and not\r\n    _theories_, while the astronomical conclusions are _theories_\r\n    based on _data_ so uncertain, that while in some cases they give\r\n    results incredibly short, ... in others they give results almost\r\n    incredibly long.(154)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter which, the reader is advised that the “safest course”\r\n\r\n\r\n    Seems to be to assume that Geology really proves the duration of\r\n    the present order of things to have been somewhere over 100\r\n    millions of years, and that Astronomy gives an enormous though\r\n    unknown time beyond in the past, and to come in the future, for\r\n    the birth, growth, maturity, decline, and death of the solar\r\n    system, of which our earth is a small planet now passing through\r\n    the habitable phase.(155)\r\n\r\n\r\nJudging from past experience, we do not entertain the slightest doubt\r\nthat, once called upon to answer “the absurd unscientific and preposterous\r\nclaims of exoteric (and Esoteric) Âryan chronology,” the Scientist of the\r\n“results incredibly short,” _i.e._, only 15,000,000 years, and the\r\nScientist, who “would require 600,000,000 years,” together with those who\r\naccept Mr. Huxley’s figures of 1,000,000,000(156) “since sedimentation\r\nbegan in Europe,” would all be as dogmatic the one as the other. Nor would\r\nthey fail to remind the Occultist and the Brâhman, that it is the modern\r\nmen of Science alone who represent exact Science, whose duty it is to\r\nfight “inaccuracy” and “superstition.”\r\n\r\nThe Earth is passing through the “habitable phase” only for the _present\r\norder_ of things, and as far as our present mankind is concerned with its\r\nactual “coats of skin” and phosphorus for bones and brain.\r\n\r\nWe are ready to concede the 100 millions of years offered by Geology,\r\nsince we are taught that our present physical mankind—or the Vaivasvata\r\nHumanity—began only eighteen millions of years ago. But Geology has no\r\nfacts to give us for the duration of geological periods, as we have shown,\r\nno more indeed than has Astronomy. The authentic letter from Mr. W.\r\nPengelly, F.R.S., quoted elsewhere, says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is at present, and perhaps always will be, _impossible_ to\r\n    reduce, even approximately, geological time into years or even\r\n    into millenniums.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd having never, hitherto, excavated a fossil man of any other than the\r\n_present form_—what does Geology know of him? It has traced zones or\r\nstrata and, with these, primordial zoological life, down to the Silurian.\r\nWhen it has, in the same way, traced man down to his primordial\r\nprotoplasmic form, then we will admit that it may know something of\r\nprimordial man. If it is not very material to “the bearings of modern\r\nscientific discovery on modern thought,” whether\r\n\r\n\r\n    Man has existed in a state of constant though slow progression for\r\n    the last 50,000 years of a period of 15 millions, or for the last\r\n    500,000 years of a period of 150 millions,(157)\r\n\r\n\r\nas Mr. S. Laing tells his readers, it is very much so for the claims of\r\nthe Occultists. Unless the latter show that it is a _possibility_, if not\r\na perfect certainty, that man lived eighteen millions of years ago, the\r\n_Secret Doctrine_ might as well have remained unwritten. An attempt must,\r\ntherefore, be made in this direction, and it is our modern Geologists and\r\nmen of Science generally who will be brought to testify to this fact in\r\nthe Third Part of this Volume. Meanwhile, and notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat Hindû Chronology is constantly represented by the Orientalists as a\r\nfiction based on no “actual” computation,(158) but simply a “childish\r\nboasting,” it is nevertheless often twisted out of recognition to make it\r\nyield to, and fit in with, Western theories. No figures have ever been\r\nmore meddled with and tortured than the famous 4, 3, 2, followed by\r\ncyphers, of the Yugas and Mahâ Yugas.\r\n\r\nAs the whole Cycle of pre‐historic events, such as the evolution and\r\ntransformation of Races and the extreme antiquity of man, hangs upon the\r\nsaid Chronology, it becomes extremely important to check it by other\r\nexisting calculations. If the Eastern Chronology is rejected, we shall at\r\nleast have the consolation of proving that no other—whether in the figures\r\nof Science or of the Churches—is one whit more reliable. As Professor Max\r\nMüller expresses it, it is often as useful to prove what a thing is not as\r\nto show what it may be. And once we succeed in pointing out the fallacies\r\nof both Christian and Scientific computations—by allowing them a fair\r\nchance of comparison with our Chronology—neither of these will have a\r\nreasonable ground to stand upon, in pronouncing the Esoteric figures less\r\nreliable than its own.\r\n\r\nWe may here refer the reader to our earlier work, _Isis Unveiled_,(159)\r\nfor some remarks concerning the figures which were cited a few pages back.\r\n\r\nTo‐day a few more facts may be added to the information there given, which\r\nis already known to every Orientalist. The sacredness of the cycle of\r\n4,320, with additional cyphers, lies in the fact that the figures which\r\ncompose it, taken separately or joined in various combinations, are each\r\nand all symbolical of the greatest mysteries in Nature. Indeed, whether\r\none takes the 4 separately, or the 3 by itself, or the two together making\r\n7, or again the three, 4, 3, 2, added together and yielding 9, all these\r\nnumbers have their application in the most sacred and Occult matters, and\r\nrecord the workings of Nature in her eternally periodical phenomena. They\r\nare never erring, perpetually recurring numbers, unveiling, to him who\r\nstudies the secrets of Nature, a truly divine System, an intelligent plan\r\nin Cosmogony, which results in natural cosmic divisions of times, seasons,\r\ninvisible influences, astronomical phenomena, with their action and\r\nreäction on terrestrial and even moral nature; on birth, death, and\r\ngrowth, on health and disease. All these natural events are based and\r\ndepend upon cyclical processes in the Kosmos itself, producing periodic\r\nagencies which, acting from without, affect the Earth and all that lives\r\nand breathes on it, from the one end to the other of any Manvantara.\r\nCauses and effects are esoteric, exoteric and “endexoteric,” so to say.\r\n\r\nIn _Isis Unveiled_ we wrote that which we now repeat: _We are at the\r\nbottom of a cycle and evidently in a transitory state_. Plato divides the\r\nintellectual progress of the Universe during every Cycle into fertile and\r\nbarren periods. In the sublunary regions, the spheres of the various\r\nelements remain eternally in perfect harmony with the Divine Nature, he\r\nsays; “but their parts,” owing to a too close proximity to earth, and\r\ntheir commingling with the earthly (which is Matter, and therefore the\r\nrealm of evil), “are sometimes according, and sometimes contrary to\r\n(Divine) Nature.” When those circulations—which Éliphas Lévi calls\r\n“currents of the Astral Light”—in the universal Ether which contains in\r\nitself every element, take place in harmony with the Divine Spirit, our\r\nEarth and everything pertaining to it enjoys a fertile period. The Occult\r\npowers of plants, animals, and minerals magically sympathize with the\r\n“superior natures,” and the Divine Soul of man is in perfect intelligence\r\nwith these “inferior” ones. But during the barren periods, the latter lose\r\ntheir magic sympathy, and the spiritual sight of the majority of mankind\r\nis so blinded as to lose every notion of the superior powers of its own\r\nDivine Spirit. We are in a barren period; the eighteenth century, during\r\nwhich the malignant fever of scepticism broke out so irrepressibly, has\r\nentailed unbelief as a hereditary disease upon the nineteenth. The divine\r\nintellect is veiled in man; his animal brain alone “philosophizes.” And\r\nphilosophizing alone, how can it understand the “Soul Doctrine”?\r\n\r\nIn order not to break the thread of the narrative we shall give some\r\nstriking proofs of these cyclic laws in Part II, proceeding meanwhile with\r\nour explanations of Geological and Racial Cycles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStanza III. Attempts To Create Man.\r\n\r\n\r\n    11. The Descent of the Demiurge. 12. The Lunar Gods ordered to\r\n    create. 13. The Higher Gods refuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. THE LORD OF THE LORDS CAME. FROM HER BODY HE SEPARATED THE WATERS, AND\r\nTHAT WAS HEAVEN ABOVE, THE FIRST HEAVEN.(160)\r\n\r\nHere tradition falls again into the Universal. As in the earliest version,\r\nrepeated in the _Purânas_, so in the latest, the Mosaic account. In the\r\nfirst it is said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    He the Lord [the God who has the form of Brahmâ], when the world\r\n    had become one ocean, concluding that within the waters lay the\r\n    earth, and desirous to raise it up [to separate it], created\r\n    himself in another form. As in the preceding Kalpa [Manvantara] he\r\n    had assumed the shape of a tortoise, so in this one he took the\r\n    shape of a boar, etc.(161)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Elohistic “creation,”(162) “God” creates “a firmament in the midst\r\nof the waters,” and says “let _dry land_ appear.” And now comes the\r\ntraditional peg whereunto is hung the Esoteric portion of the Kabalistic\r\ninterpretation.\r\n\r\n12. THE GREAT CHOHANS(163) CALLED THE LORDS OF THE MOON, OF THE AIRY\r\nBODIES: “BRING FORTH MEN,(164) MEN OF YOUR NATURE. GIVE THEM(165) THEIR\r\nFORMS WITHIN. SHE(166) WILL BUILD COVERINGS WITHOUT.(167) MALES‐FEMALES\r\nWILL THEY BE. LORDS OF THE FLAME ALSO....”\r\n\r\nWho are the “Lords of the Moon”? In India they are called Pitris or “Lunar\r\nAncestors,” but in the Hebrew scrolls it is Jehovah himself who is the\r\n“Lord of the Moon,” collectively as the Host, and also as one of the\r\nElohim. The Astronomy of the Hebrews and their “observance of _times_” was\r\nregulated by the Moon. A Kabalist, having shown that “Daniel ... told off\r\nGod’s providence by set _times_” and that the _Revelation_ of John “speaks\r\nof a carefully measured _cubical_ city descending out of the heavens,”\r\netc., adds:\r\n\r\n\r\n    But the vitalizing power of heaven lay chiefly with _the moon_....\r\n    It was the Hebrew יהוה [Jehovah],—and St. Paul enjoins:—“Let no\r\n    man judge you for your observance of the 7th day, and the day of\r\n    _new moon,—which are a shadow of things to come_; but the body (or\r\n    substance) is of Christ,” _i.e._, Jehovah,—that function of this\r\n    power that “made the barren woman the joyful mother of\r\n    children,”—“for they are the gift of Jehovah,” ... which is a key\r\n    to the objection which her husband made to the Shunamite, as to\r\n    her going to the man of God:—“for it is neither the 7th day nor\r\n    the day of _new moon_.” The living spiritual powers of the\r\n    constellations had mighty wars marked by the movements and\r\n    positions of the stars and planets, and especially as the result\r\n    of the conjunction of the moon, earth and sun. Bentley comments on\r\n    the Hindû “war between the gods and the giants,” as marked by the\r\n    eclipse of the sun at the ascending node of the moon, 945 B.C.\r\n    [!], at which time was born,(168) or produced from the sea, SRI\r\n    (Sarai), S‐r‐i, the wife of the Hebrew Abram(169), who was the\r\n    Venus‐Aphroditus [_sic_] of the Westerns, emblem “of the luni‐\r\n    solar year, or the moon, [as Sri is the wife of the Moon; see\r\n    foot‐note], the goddess of increase.”(170) ... [Therefore] the\r\n    grand monument and land‐mark of the exact period of the lunar year\r\n    and month, by which this cycle [of 19 tropical years of the sun\r\n    and 235 revolutions of the moon] could be calculated, was Mount\r\n    Sinai,—the Lord Jehovah coming down thereon.... Paul speaks [then]\r\n    as a mystagogue, when he says concerning the freed woman and bond\r\n    woman of Abraham:—“For this Hagar (the bond woman of Abraham) is\r\n    Mount Sinai in Arabia.” How could a woman be a mountain? and such\r\n    a mountain! Yet, in one sense, ... she was, and in a very\r\n    marvellously true one. Her name was Hagar, הגר whose numbers read\r\n    235, or in exact measure, the very number of lunar months to equal\r\n    19 tropical years to complete this cycle and make the likeness and\r\n    similitude good; Mount Sinai being, in the esoteric language of\r\n    this wisdom, the monument of the exact time of the lunar year and\r\n    month, by which this spiritual vitalizing cycle could be computed,\r\n    and which mountain, indeed, was called (Fuerst) “the Mountain of\r\n    the Moon (Sin).” So also Sarai (SRI), the wife of Abram, could\r\n    have no child until her name was changed to Sarah, שרה, giving to\r\n    her the property of this lunar influence.(171)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis may be regarded as a digression from the main subject; but it is a\r\nvery necessary one with a view to Christian readers. For who, after\r\nstudying dispassionately the respective legends of Abram or Abraham, Sarai\r\nor Sarah, who was “fair to look upon,” and those of Brahmâ and Sarasvatî,\r\nor Shrî, Lakshmî‐Venus, with the relations of all these to the Moon and\r\nWater;—and especially one who understands the real Kabalistic meaning of\r\nthe name Jehovah and its relation to, and connection with, the Moon—who\r\ncan doubt that the story of Abram is based upon that of Brahmâ, or that\r\n_Genesis_ was written upon the old lines used by every ancient nation? All\r\nin the ancient Scriptures is allegorical—all based upon and inseparably\r\nconnected with Astronomy and Cosmolatry.\r\n\r\n13. THEY(172) WENT EACH ON HIS ALLOTTED LAND: SEVEN OF THEM, EACH ON HIS\r\nLOT. THE LORDS OF THE FLAME REMAIN BEHIND. THEY WOULD NOT GO, THEY WOULD\r\nNOT CREATE.\r\n\r\nThe Secret Teachings show the divine Progenitors creating men on seven\r\nportions of the Globe “each on his lot”—_i.e._, each a different Race of\r\nmen externally and internally, and on different Zones. This polygenistic\r\nclaim is considered elsewhere, in Stanza VII. But who are “They” who\r\ncreate, and the “Lords of the Flame,” “who would not”? Occultism divides\r\nthe “Creators” into Twelve Classes; of which four have reached\r\n“Liberation” to the end of the “Great Age,” the fifth is ready to reach\r\nit, but still remains active on the intellectual planes, while seven are\r\nstill under direct Karmic Law. These last act on the man‐bearing Globes of\r\nour Chain.\r\n\r\nExoteric Hindû books mention Seven Classes of Pitris, and among them two\r\ndistinct kinds of Progenitors or Ancestors: the Barhishad and the\r\nAgnishvâtta; or those possessed of the “sacred fire” and those devoid of\r\nit. Hindû ritualism seems to connect them with sacrificial fires, and with\r\nGrihastha Brâhmans in earlier incarnations; those who have, and those who\r\nhave _not_ attended as they should to their household sacred fires in\r\ntheir previous births. The distinction, as said, is derived from the\r\n_Vedas_. The first and highest class (Esoterically), the Agnishvâtta, are\r\nrepresented in the exoteric allegory as Grihastha or Brâhman‐householders,\r\nwho, having failed to maintain their domestic fires and to offer burnt\r\nsacrifices, in their past births in other Manvantaras, have lost every\r\nright to have oblations with fire presented to them. Whereas the\r\nBarhishad, being Brâhmans who have kept up their household sacred fires,\r\nare thus honoured to this day. Thence the Agnishvâtta are represented as\r\ndevoid of, and the Barhishad as possessed of, fires.\r\n\r\nBut Esoteric Philosophy explains the original qualifications as being due\r\nto the difference between the natures of the two Classes: the Agnishvâtta\r\nPitris are devoid of “fire” _i.e._, of creative passion, because they are\r\ntoo divine and pure; whereas the Barhishad, being the Lunar Spirits more\r\nclosely connected with Earth, became the creative Elohim of form, or the\r\nAdam of dust.\r\n\r\nThe allegory says that Sanandana and other Vedhas, the Sons of Brahmâ, his\r\nfirst progeny:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Were without desire or passion, inspired with holy wisdom,\r\n    estranged from the universe and _undesirous of progeny_.(173)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis also is what is meant in the shloka by the words, “They would not\r\ncreate,” and is explained as follows:\r\n\r\n“_The Primordial Emanations from the Creative Power are too near the\r\nAbsolute Cause. They are transitional and latent forces, which will\r\ndevelop only in the next and subsequent removes._”\r\n\r\nThis makes it plain. Hence Brahmâ is said to have felt wrathful when he\r\nsaw that those\r\n\r\n\r\n    Embodied spirits, produced from his limbs [_gâtra_], would not\r\n    multiply themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter which, in the allegory, he creates other seven Mind‐born Sons(174)\r\nnamely, Marichi, Atri, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu and Vasishtha, the\r\nlatter being often replaced by Daksha, the most prolific of the Creators.\r\nIn most of the texts these Seven Sons of Vasishtha‐Daksha are called the\r\nSeven Rishis of the _Third_ Manvantara; the latter referring both to the\r\nThird Round and also to the Third Root‐Race and its Branch‐Races in the\r\nFourth Round. These are all the Creators of the various Beings on this\r\nEarth, the Prajâpati, and at the same time they appear as divers\r\nreïncarnations in the early Manvantaras or Races.\r\n\r\nIt thus becomes clear why the Agnishvâtta, devoid of the grosser “creative\r\nfire,” hence unable to create physical man, having no Double, or Astral\r\nBody, to project, since they were without any “form,” are shown in\r\nexoteric allegories as Yogîs, Kumâras (chaste youths), who became\r\n“rebels,” Asuras, fighting and opposing Gods,(175) etc. Yet it is they\r\nalone who could complete man, _i.e._, make of him a self‐conscious, almost\r\na divine Being—a God on Earth. The Barhishad, though possessed of\r\n“creative fire,” were devoid of the higher Mahat‐ic element. Being on a\r\nlevel with the lower “Principles”—those which precede gross objective\r\nmatter—they could only give birth to the outer man, or rather to the model\r\nof the physical, the astral man. Thus, though we see them intrusted with\r\nthe task by Brahmâ—the collective Mahat or Universal Divine Mind—the\r\n“Mystery of Creation” is repeated on Earth, only in an inverted sense, as\r\nin a _mirror_.\r\n\r\nIt is those who are unable to create the spiritual immortal man, who\r\nproject the senseless model (the Astral) of the physical Being; and, as\r\nwill be seen, it was those who would not multiply, who sacrificed\r\nthemselves to the good and salvation of Spiritual Humanity. For, to\r\ncomplete the _septenary man_, to add to his three lower Principles and\r\ncement them with the Spiritual Monad—which could never dwell in such a\r\nform otherwise than in an _absolutely latent state_—two connecting\r\n“Principles” are needed: Manas and Kâma. This requires a living Spiritual\r\nFire of the middle Principle from the Fifth and Third States of Plerôma.\r\nBut this Fire is the possession of the Triangles, not of the (perfect)\r\nCubes, which symbolize the Angelic Beings;(176) the former having from the\r\nFirst Creation possessed themselves of it and being said to have\r\nappropriated it for themselves, as in the allegory of Prometheus. These\r\nare the active, and therefore—in Heaven—no longer “pure” Beings. They have\r\nbecome the independent and free Intelligences, shown in every Theogony as\r\nfighting for that independence and freedom, and hence—in the ordinary\r\nsense—“rebellious to the divine passive law.” These are then those\r\n“Flames”—the Agnishvâtta—who, as shown in the shloka, “remain behind,”\r\ninstead of going along with the others to create men on Earth. But the\r\ntrue Esoteric meaning is that most of them were destined to incarnate as\r\nthe Egos of the forthcoming crop of Mankind.\r\n\r\nThe human Ego is neither Âtman nor Buddhi, but the Higher Manas; the\r\nintellectual fruitage and the efflorescence of the intellectual self‐\r\nconscious Egotism—in the higher spiritual sense. The ancient works refer\r\nto it as Kârana Sharîra on the plane of Sûtrâtmâ, which is the “golden\r\nthread” on which, like beads, the various Personalities of this Higher Ego\r\nare strung. If the reader were told, as in the _semi‐Esoteric_ allegories,\r\nthat these Beings were returning Nirvânîs from preceding\r\nMahâ‐Manvantaras—Ages of incalculable duration which have rolled away in\r\nthe Eternity, a still more incalculable time ago—he would hardly\r\nunderstand the text correctly; while some Vedântins might say: “This is\r\nnot so; the Nirvânî can never return”; which is true during the Manvantara\r\nhe belongs to, and erroneous where Eternity is concerned. For it is said\r\nin the Sacred Shlokas:\r\n\r\n“_The Thread of Radiance which is imperishable and dissolves only in __\r\nNirvâna, reëmerges from it in its integrity on the day when the Great Law\r\ncalls all things back into action._”\r\n\r\nHence, as the higher Pitris or Dhyânîs had no hand in his physical\r\ncreation, we find Primeval Man—issued from the bodies of his _spiritually_\r\n“fireless” Progenitors—described as aëriform, devoid of compactness, and\r\n“mindless.” He had no middle Principle to serve him as a medium between\r\nthe Highest and the Lowest—the Spiritual Man and the physical brain—for he\r\nlacked Manas. The Monads which incarnated in those _empty_ Shells,\r\nremained as unconscious as when separated from their previous incomplete\r\nforms and vehicles. There is no potentiality for Creation, or Self‐\r\nConsciousness, in a _pure_ Spirit on this our plane, unless its too\r\nhomogeneous, perfect—because divine—nature is, so to say, mixed with, and\r\nstrengthened by, an essence already differentiated. It is only the lower\r\nline of the Triangle—representing the first Triad that emanates from the\r\nUniversal Monad—that can furnish this needed consciousness on the plane of\r\ndifferentiated Nature. But how could these pure Emanations, which, on this\r\nprinciple, must have originally been themselves “unconscious” (in our\r\nsense), be of any use in supplying the required Principle, as they could\r\nhardly have possessed it themselves?\r\n\r\nThe answer is difficult to comprehend, unless one is well acquainted with\r\nthe philosophical metaphysics of a beginningless and endless series of\r\nCosmic Re‐births, and becomes well impressed and familiarized with that\r\nimmutable law of Nature which is ETERNAL MOTION, cyclic and\r\nspiral—therefore progressive even in its seeming retrogression. The one\r\nDivine Principle, the nameless THAT of the _Vedas_, is the Universal\r\nTotal, which, neither in its spiritual aspects and emanations, nor in its\r\nphysical Atoms, can ever be at “Absolute Rest” except during the Nights of\r\nBrahmâ. Hence, also, the “First‐born” are those who are first set in\r\nmotion at the beginning of a Manvantara, and thus the first to fall into\r\nthe lower spheres of materiality. They who are called in Theology the\r\n“Thrones,” and are the “Seat of God,” must be the first incarnated men on\r\nEarth; and it becomes comprehensible, if we think of the endless series of\r\npast Manvantaras, to find that the last had to come first, and the first\r\nlast. We find, in short, that the higher Angels had broken, countless æons\r\nbefore, through the “Seven Circles,” and thus “robbed” them of the Sacred\r\nFire; this means in plain words, that they had assimilated during their\r\npast incarnations, in lower as well as in higher Worlds, all the wisdom\r\ntherefrom—the reflection of Mahat in its various degrees of intensity. No\r\nEntity, whether angelic or human, can reach the state of Nirvâna, or of\r\nabsolute purity, except through æons of suffering and the _knowledge_ of\r\nevil as well as of good, as otherwise the latter would remain\r\nincomprehensible.\r\n\r\nBetween man and the animal—whose Monads, or Jîvas, are fundamentally\r\nidentical—there is the impassable abyss of Mentality and Self‐\r\nconsciousness. What is human mind in its higher aspect, whence comes it,\r\nif it be not a portion of the essence—and, in some rare cases of\r\nincarnation, the _very essence_—of a higher Being; one from a higher and\r\ndivine plane? Can man—a God in the animal form—be the product of Material\r\nNature by evolution alone, even as is the animal which differs from man in\r\nexternal shape, but by no means in the materials of its physical fabric,\r\nand is informed by the same, though undeveloped, Monad—seeing that the\r\nintellectual potentialities of the two differ as the sun does from the\r\nglow‐worm? And what is it that creates such difference, unless man is an\r\nanimal _plus a living God_ within his physical shell? Let us pause and ask\r\nourselves seriously the question, regardless of the vagaries and sophisms\r\nof both the materialistic and the psychological modern Sciences.\r\n\r\nTo some extent, it is admitted that even the Esoteric Teaching is\r\nallegorical. To make the latter comprehensible to the average\r\nintelligence, the use of symbols cast in an intelligible form is needed.\r\nHence the allegorical and semi‐mythical narratives in the exoteric, and\r\nthe only _semi_‐metaphysical and objective representations in the Esoteric\r\nTeachings. For the purely and transcendentally spiritual conceptions are\r\nadapted only to the perceptions of those who “_see without eyes, hear\r\nwithout ears, and sense without organs_,” according to the graphic\r\nexpression of the Commentary. The too puritan Idealist is at liberty to\r\nspiritualize the tenet, whereas the modern Psychologist would simply try\r\nto spirit away our “fallen,” yet still divine, human Soul—divine in its\r\nconnection with Buddhi.\r\n\r\nThe mystery attached to the highly spiritual Ancestors of the _Divine_ Man\r\nwithin the earthly man is very great. His dual creation is hinted at in\r\nthe _Purânas_, though its Esoteric meaning can be approached only by\r\ncollating together the many varying accounts, and reading them in their\r\nsymbolical and allegorical character. So it is in the _Bible_, both in\r\n_Genesis_ and even in the _Epistles_ of Paul. For that “Creator,” who is\r\ncalled in the second chapter of _Genesis_ the “Lord God,” is in the\r\noriginal the Elohim, or Gods (the Lords), in the plural; and while one of\r\nthem makes the earthly Adam of Dust, the other breathes into him the\r\nBreath of Life, and the third makes of him a Living Soul, all of which\r\nreadings are implied in the plural number of the word Elohim.(177) Or\r\nagain, as Paul says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The first man is of the earth, the second [the last, or rather\r\n    highest] is the Lord from heaven.(178)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Âryan allegory the rebellious Sons of Brahmâ are all represented as\r\nholy Ascetics and Yogîs. Re‐born in every Kalpa, they generally try to\r\nimpede the work of human procreation. When Daksha, the chief of the\r\nPrajâpatis or Creators, brings forth 10,000 sons for the purpose of\r\npeopling the world, Nârada—a son of Brahmâ, the great Rishi, and\r\n_virtually_ a Kumâra, if not so in name—interferes with, and twice\r\nfrustrates Daksha’s aim, by persuading those Sons to remain holy Ascetics\r\nand eschew marriage. For this, Daksha curses Nârada to be “re‐born as a\r\nman,” as Brahmâ had cursed him before for refusing to marry, and obtain\r\nprogeny, saying: “Perish in thy (present [Deva or Angelic] form); and take\r\nup thy abode in the womb”—_i.e._, become a man.(179)\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding several conflicting versions of the same story, it is easy\r\nto see that Nârada belongs to that Class of Brahmâ’s “First‐born,” who\r\nhave all proven rebellious to the law of animal procreation, for which\r\nthey had to incarnate as _men_. Of all the Vedic Rishis, Nârada, as\r\nalready shown, is the most incomprehensible, because the most closely\r\nconnected with the Occult Doctrines—especially with the Secret Cycles and\r\nKalpas.\r\n\r\nCertain contradictory statements about this Sage have much distracted the\r\nOrientalists. Thus he is shown as refusing positively to “create” or have\r\nprogeny, and even as calling his father Brahmâ a “false teacher” for\r\nadvising him to get married, as related in the _Nârada‐Pancha‐Râtra_;\r\nnevertheless, he is referred to as one of the Prajâpatis or Progenitors!\r\nIn the _Nâradîya Purâna_, he describes the laws and the duties of the\r\ncelibate Adepts; and as these Occult duties do not happen to be found in\r\nthe fragment of about 3,000 Stanzas in the possession of European museums,\r\nthe Brâhmans are proclaimed liars; the Orientalists forgetting that the\r\n_Nâradîya_ is credited with containing 25,000 Stanzas, and that it is not\r\nvery likely that such MSS. should be found in the hands of the Hindû\r\nprofane, those who are ready to sell any precious Olla for a red pottage.\r\nSuffice it to say, that Nârada is _the_ Deva‐Rishi of Occultism _par\r\nexcellence_, and that the Occultist who does not ponder, analyze, and\r\nstudy Nârada from his seven Esoteric facets, will never be able to fathom\r\ncertain anthropological, chronological, and even cosmic Mysteries. He is\r\none of the Fires above‐mentioned, and plays a part in the evolution of\r\nthis Kalpa from its incipient down to its final stage. He is an actor who\r\nappears in each of the successive acts, or Root‐Races, of the present\r\nManvantaric drama, in the world‐allegories which strike the key‐note of\r\nEsotericism, and are now becoming more familiar to the reader. But shall\r\nwe turn to other ancient Scriptures and documents for the corroboration of\r\nthe “Fires,” “Sparks,” and “Flames”? They are plentiful, if one only seeks\r\nfor them in the right places.\r\n\r\nIn the Kabalistic _Book of the Concealed Mystery_ they are clearly\r\nenunciated, as also in the _Ha Idra Zuta Qadisha_, or “The Lesser Holy\r\nAssembly.” The language is very mystical and veiled, yet still\r\ncomprehensible. In the latter, among the sparks of Prior Worlds,\r\n“vibrating Flames and Sparks,” from the divine flint, the “Workman”\r\nproceeds to create man, “male and female” (427). These “Flames and\r\nSparks”—Angels and their Worlds, Stars and Planets—are said, figuratively,\r\nto become extinct and die, that is to say, remain “unmanifested” until a\r\ncertain process of Nature is accomplished. To show how thickly veiled from\r\npublic view are the most important facts of Anthropogenesis, two passages\r\nare now quoted from two Kabalistic books. The first is from the _Ha Idra\r\nZuta Qadisha_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    429. From a Light‐Bearer [one of the Seven Sacred Planets] of\r\n    insupportable brightness proceeded a Radiating Flame, dashing off\r\n    like a vast and mighty hammer those sparks which were the Prior\r\n    Worlds.\r\n\r\n    430. And with most subtle ether were these intermingled and bound\r\n    mutually together, but _only when they were conjoined together_,\r\n    even the Great Father and Great Mother.\r\n\r\n    431. From _Hoa_, Himself, is AB, the Father; and from _Hoa_,\r\n    Himself, is Ruach, the Spirit; Who are hidden in the Ancient of\r\n    Days, and therein is that ether concealed.\r\n\r\n    432. And It was connected with a light‐bearer [a Planet and its\r\n    Angel or Regent], which went forth from that Light‐Bearer of\r\n    insupportable brightness, which is hidden in the bosom of Aima,\r\n    the Great Mother.(180)\r\n\r\n\r\nNow the following extract from the _Zohar_,(181) under the heading, “The\r\nPre‐Adamite Kings,” also deals with the same mystery:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We have learned in the Siphrah D’Tznioothah: That the _At‐tee’ kah\r\n    D’At‐tee’ keen_, Ancient of Ancients, before He prepared His Form,\r\n    built kings and engraved kings, and sketched out kings [men, the\r\n    “kings” of the animals], and they could not exist: till He\r\n    overthrew them and _hid them until after a time_, therefore it is\r\n    written; “And these are the kings which reigned in the land of\r\n    Edom.”... And they could not exist till _Resha’Hiv’rah_, the White\r\n    Head, the _At’‐tee’‐kah D’At‐tee’‐keen_, Ancient of the Ancients,\r\n    arranged Himself. When he arranged Himself He formed all forms\r\n    Above and Below.... Before He arranged Himself in His Form, had\r\n    not been formed all those whom He desired to form, and all worlds\r\n    have been destroyed.... They did not remain in their places,\r\n    because the form of the kings had not been formed as it ought to\r\n    be, and _the Holy City had not been prepared_.(182)\r\n\r\n\r\nNow the plain meaning of these two allegorical and metaphysical\r\ndisquisitions is simply this: Worlds and men were in turn formed and\r\ndestroyed, _under the law of evolution_ and _from preëxisting material_,\r\nuntil both the Planets and their men, in our case our Earth and its animal\r\nand human races, became what they are now in the present cycle—opposite\r\npolar forces, an equilibrized compound of Spirit and Matter, of the\r\npositive and the negative, of the male and the female. Before man could\r\nbecome male and female _physically_, his prototype, the creating Elohim,\r\nhad to arrange his Form on this sexual plane _astrally_. That is to say,\r\nthe Atoms and the organic forces, descending into the plane of the given\r\ndifferentiation, had to be marshalled in the order intended by Nature, so\r\nas to be ever carrying out, in an immaculate way, that law which the\r\nKabalah calls the “Balance,” through which everything that exists does so\r\nas male and female in its final perfection, in this present stage of\r\nmateriality. Chokmah, Wisdom, the Male Sephira, had to diffuse itself\r\n_in_, and _through_, Binah, intelligent Nature, or Understanding.\r\nTherefore the First Root‐Race of men, sexless and mindless, had to be\r\noverthrown and “hidden until after a time”; _i.e._, the First Race,\r\ninstead of dying, disappeared _in_ the Second Race, as certain lower lives\r\nand plants do in their progeny. It was a wholesale transformation. The\r\nFirst became the Second Root‐Race, without either begetting it,\r\nprocreating it, or dying.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “They _passed by_ together,” as it is written: “And he died” and\r\n    another “reigned in his stead.”(183)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy? Because the “_Holy City_ had not been prepared.” And what is the\r\n“Holy City”? The Ma‐qom—the Secret Place or the Shrine—on Earth; in other\r\nwords, the human womb, the microcosmic copy and reflection of the Heavenly\r\nMatrix, the female Space or primeval Chaos, in which the male Spirit\r\nfecundates the germ of the Son, or the visible Universe. So much so, that\r\nin the paragraph on “The Emanation of the Male and Female Principles” in\r\nthe _Zohar_, it is said that, on this Earth, the Wisdom from the “Holy\r\nAncient” “does not shine except in male and female.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    (_Hokhmah_ Wisdom, is the Father, and _Binah_ Understanding, is\r\n    the Mother.)... And when they connect one with the other, they\r\n    bring forth and diffuse and emanate Truth. In the sayings of Rabbi\r\n    Ye‐yeva, Sabbah, _i.e._, the Old, we learned this; What is Binah\r\n    Understanding? But when they connect in one another, the י (Yod)\r\n    in the ה (Heh), they become impregnated and produce a Son. And,\r\n    therefore, it is called _Binah_, Understanding. It means BeN YaH,\r\n    _i.e._, Son of YaH. This is the completeness of the Whole.(184)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is also the “completeness” of phallicism by the Rabbis, its perfect\r\napotheosis, the divine being dragged into the animal, the sublime into the\r\ngrossness of the terrestrial. Nothing so graphically gross exists in\r\nEastern Occultism, nor in the primitive Kabalah—the Chaldæan _Book of\r\nNumbers_. We have said so already in _Isis Unveiled_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We find it rather unwise on the part of Catholic writers to pour\r\n    out their vials of wrath in such sentences as these: “In a\r\n    multitude of pagodas, the phallic stone, ever and always assuming,\r\n    like the Grecian _batylos_, the brutally indecent form of the\r\n    _lingham_ ... the Mahâ Deva.” Before casting slurs on a symbol\r\n    whose profound metaphysical meaning is too much for the modern\r\n    champions of that religion of sensualism _par excellence_, Roman\r\n    Catholicism, to grasp, they are in duty bound to destroy their\r\n    oldest churches, and change the form of the cupolas of their own\r\n    temples. The Mahadeo of Elephanta, the Round Tower of Bhagulpore,\r\n    the minarets of Islam—either rounded or pointed—are the originals\r\n    of the Campanile column of San Marco, at Venice, of Rochester\r\n    Cathedral, and of the modern Duomo of Milan. All of these\r\n    steeples, turrets, domes, and Christian temples, are the\r\n    reproductions of the primitive idea of the _lithos_, the upright\r\n    phallus.(185)\r\n\r\n\r\nNevertheless, and however it may be, the fact that all these Hebrew\r\nElohim, Sparks, and Cherubs are identical with the Devas, Rishis and the\r\nFires and Flames, the Rudras and the forty‐nine Agnis of the ancient\r\nÂryas, is sufficiently proven by and in the Kabalah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStanza IV. Creation Of The First Races.\r\n\r\n\r\n    14. Creation of men. 15. They are empty shadows. 16. The Creators\r\n    are perplexed how to create a _thinking_ man. 17. What is needed\r\n    for the formation of a perfect Man.\r\n\r\n\r\n14. THE SEVEN HOSTS, THE WILL‐BORN(186) LORDS, PROPELLED BY THE SPIRIT OF\r\nLIFE‐GIVING,(187) SEPARATE MEN FROM THEMSELVES, EACH ON HIS OWN ZONE.\r\n\r\nThey threw off their “Shadows” or Astral Bodies—if such an ethereal being\r\nas a “Lunar Spirit” may be supposed to rejoice in an Astral, besides a\r\nhardly tangible Body. In another Commentary it is said that the Ancestors\r\n_breathed_ out the first man, as Brahmâ is explained to have breathed out\r\nthe Suras, or Gods, when they became Asuras (from Asu, breath). In a third\r\nit is said that they, the newly‐created Men, were the “shadows of the\r\nShadows.”\r\n\r\nWith regard to this sentence—“They were the shadows of the Shadows”—a few\r\nmore words may be said and a fuller explanation attempted. This first\r\nprocess of the evolution of mankind is far easier to accept than the one\r\nwhich follows it, though one and all such processes will be rejected and\r\ndoubted even by some Kabalists, especially the Western, who study the\r\npresent effects, but have neglected to study their primary causes. Nor\r\ndoes the writer feel competent to explain a mode of procreation so\r\ndifficult of appreciation save for an Eastern Occultist. Therefore it is\r\nuseless to enter here into details concerning the process, though it is\r\nminutely described in the Secret Books, as it would only lead to speaking\r\nof facts hitherto unknown to the profane world, and hence to their being\r\nmisunderstood. An Adam made of the dust of the ground will always be found\r\npreferable, by a certain class of students, to one projected out of the\r\nethereal body of his creator; though the former process has never been\r\nheard of, while the latter is familiar, as all know, to many Spiritualists\r\nin Europe and America, who, of all men, ought to understand it. For who of\r\nthose who have witnessed the phenomenon of a materializing form oozing out\r\nof the pores of a medium or, at other times, out of his _left side_, can\r\nfail to credit the possibility, at least, of such a _birth_? If there are\r\nin the Universe such beings as Angels or Spirits, whose _incorporeal_\r\nessence may constitute an intelligent Entity, notwithstanding the absence\r\nof any (to us) solid organism; and if there are those who believe that a\r\nGod made the first man out of dust, and breathed into him a living\r\nSoul—and there are millions upon millions who believe both—what does this\r\ndoctrine of ours contain that is so impossible? Very soon the day will\r\ndawn, when the world will have to choose whether it will accept the\r\nmiraculous creation of man (and Kosmos too) out of _nothing_, according to\r\nthe dead letter of _Genesis_, or a first man born from a fantastic\r\nlink—absolutely “missing” so far—the common ancestor of man, and of the\r\n“true ape.”(188) Between these two fallacies, Occult Philosophy steps in.\r\nIt teaches that the first human stock was projected by higher and semi‐\r\ndivine Beings out of their own essences. If the latter process is to be\r\nconsidered as abnormal or even inconceivable—because obsolete in Nature at\r\nthis point of evolution—it is yet proven possible on the authority of\r\ncertain “spiritualistic” _facts_. Which, then, we ask of the three\r\nhypotheses or theories is the most reasonable and the least absurd?\r\nCertainly no one—provided he be not a soul‐blind Materialist—can ever\r\nobject to the Occult Teaching.\r\n\r\nNow, as shown, we gather from the latter that man was not “created” the\r\ncomplete being he is now, however imperfect he still remains. There was a\r\nspiritual, a psychic, an intellectual, and an animal evolution, from the\r\nhighest to the lowest, as well as a physical development—from the simple\r\nand homogeneous, up to the more complex and heterogeneous; though not\r\nquite on the lines traced for us by the modern Evolutionists. This double\r\nevolution in two contrary directions, required various ages, of divers\r\nnatures and degrees of spirituality and intellectuality, to fabricate the\r\nbeing now known as man. Furthermore, the one absolute, ever acting and\r\nnever erring law, which proceeds on the same lines from one Eternity (or\r\nManvantara) to the other—ever furnishing an ascending scale for the\r\nmanifested, or that which we call the great Illusion (Mahâ‐Mâyâ), but\r\nplunging Spirit deeper and deeper into materiality on the one hand, and\r\nthen _redeeming it through flesh_ and liberating it—this law, we say, uses\r\nfor these purposes the Beings from other and higher planes, men, or Minds\r\n(Manus), in accordance with their Karmic exigencies.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, the reader is again asked to turn to the Indian\r\nPhilosophy and Religion. The Esotericism of both is at one with our Secret\r\nDoctrine, however much the form may differ and vary.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn The Identity And Differences Of The Incarnating Powers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Progenitors of Man, called in India Fathers, Pitaras, or Pitris, are\r\nthe “Creators” of our bodies and lower principles. They are ourselves, as\r\nthe _first personalities_, and _we are they_. Primeval man would be “the\r\nbone of their bone and the flesh of their flesh,” if they had bones and\r\nflesh. As stated, they were “Lunar Beings.”\r\n\r\nThe endowers of man with his conscious, immortal Ego, are the “Solar\r\nAngels”—whether so regarded metaphorically or literally. The mysteries of\r\nthe Conscious Ego or Human Soul are great. The Esoteric name of these\r\nSolar Angels is, literally, the “Lords” (Nâth) of “persevering ceaseless\r\ndevotion” (Pranidhâna). Therefore they of the _Fifth_ Principle (Manas)\r\nseem to be connected with, or to have originated the system of the Yogîs\r\nwho make of Pranidhâna their _fifth_ observance.(189) It has already been\r\nexplained why the Trans‐Himâlayan Occultists regard them as evidently\r\nidentical with those who in India are termed Kumâras, Agnishvâttas, and\r\nthe Barhishads.\r\n\r\nHow precise and true is Plato’s expression, how profound and philosophical\r\nhis remark on the (Human) Soul or Ego, when he defined it as “a compound\r\nof the _same_ and the _other_.” And yet how little this hint has been\r\nunderstood, since the world took it to mean that the Soul was the Breath\r\nof God, of Jehovah. It is “the _same_ and the _other_,” as the great\r\nInitiate‐Philosopher said; for the Ego—the “Higher Self” when merged with\r\nand in the Divine Monad—is Man, and yet the _same_ as the “_other_”; the\r\nAngel in him incarnated is the same with the Universal Mahat. The great\r\nclassical writers and philosophers felt this truth, when saying that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    There must be something within us which produces our thoughts.\r\n    Something very subtle; it is a breath; it is fire; it is ether; it\r\n    is quintessence; it is a slender likeness; it is an intellection;\r\n    it is a number; it is harmony.(190)\r\n\r\n\r\nAll these are the Mânasas and Râjasas; the Kumâras, Asuras, and other\r\nRulers and Pitris, who incarnated in the Third Race, and in this and\r\nvarious other ways endowed mankind with Mind.\r\n\r\nThere are Seven Classes of Pitris, as shown below, three Incorporeal and\r\nfour Corporeal; and two kinds, the Agnishvâtta and the Barhishad. And we\r\nmay add that, as there are two kinds of Pitris, so there is a double and a\r\ntriple set of Barhishad and Agnishvâtta. The former, having given birth to\r\ntheir Astral Doubles, are reborn as Sons of Atri, and are the “Pitris of\r\nthe Demons,” or Corporeal Beings, on the authority of Manu;(191) while the\r\nAgnishvâtta are reborn as Sons of Marîchi, a Son of Brahmâ, and are the\r\n“Pitris of the Gods.”(192)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The _Vâyu Purâna_ declares the Seven Orders of Pitris to have been\r\n    originally the _first Gods_, the Vairâjas, whom Brahmâ, with the\r\n    eye of Yoga, beheld in the eternal spheres, and who are the _gods\r\n    of the gods_.... The _Matsya_ ... adds, that the Gods worshipped\r\n    them.(193)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Harivamsha_ distinguishes the Vairâjas as one class of the Pitris\r\nonly,(194) a statement corroborated in the Secret Teachings, which,\r\nhowever, identify the Vairâjas with the _elder_ Agnishvâttas(195) and the\r\nRâjasas, or Âbhûtarajasas, who are Incorporeal without even an Astral\r\nPhantom. Vishnu is said, in most of the MSS., to have incarnated in and\r\nthrough them.\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the Raivata Manvantara, again, Hari, best of gods, was born of\r\n    Sambhûti, as the divine Mânasa—originating with the deities called\r\n    Râjasas.(196)\r\n\r\n\r\nSambhûti was a daughter of Daksha, and wife of Marîchi, the father of the\r\nAgnishvâtta, who, along with the Râjasas, are ever associated with\r\nMânasas. As remarked by a far more able Sanskritist than Wilson, Mr.\r\nFitzedward Hall:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mânasa is no inappropriate name for a deity associated with the\r\n    Râjasas. We appear to have in it _mânasam_—the same as\r\n    _manas_—with the change of termination required to express male\r\n    personification.(197)\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the Sons of Virâja are Mânasa, says Nîlakantha. And Virâja is Brahmâ,\r\nand, therefore, the Incorporeal Pitris are called Vairâjas from being the\r\nSons of Virâja, says _Vayu Purâna_.\r\n\r\nWe could multiply our proofs _ad infinitum_, but it is useless. The wise\r\nwill understand our meaning, the unwise are not required to. There are\r\nthirty‐three crores, or three hundred and thirty millions, of Gods in\r\nIndia. But, as remarked by the learned lecturer on the _Bhagavad Gîtâ_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    They may be all devas, but are by no means all “gods,” in the high\r\n    spiritual sense one attributes to the term.\r\n\r\n    This is an unfortunate blunder generally committed by Europeans.\r\n    Deva is a kind of spiritual being, and because the same word is\r\n    used in ordinary parlance to mean god, it by no means follows that\r\n    we have and worship thirty‐three crores of gods. These beings, as\r\n    may be naturally inferred, have a _certain affinity_ with one of\r\n    the three component Upâdhis [basic principles] into which we have\r\n    divided man.(198)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe names of the deities of a certain mystic class change with every\r\nManvantara. Thus the twelve Great Gods, Jayas, created by Brahmâ to assist\r\nhim in the work of creation in the very beginning of the Kalpa, and who,\r\nlost in Samâdhi, neglected to create—whereupon they were cursed to be\r\nrepeatedly born in each Manvantara till the seventh—are respectively\r\ncalled Ajitas, Tushitas, Satyas, Haris, Vaikunthas, Sâdhyas, and\r\nAdityas:(199) they are Tushitas, in the second Kalpa, and Âdityas in this\r\nVaivasvata Period,(200) besides other names for each age. But they are\r\nidentical with the Mânasas or Râjasas, and these with our incarnating\r\nDhyân Chohans.\r\n\r\nYes; besides those Beings, who, like the Yakshas, Gandharvas, Kinnaras,\r\netc., taken in their _individualities_, inhabit the Astral Plane, there\r\nare real Devas, and to these classes belong the Adityas, the Vairâjas, the\r\nKumâras, the Asuras, and all those high celestial Beings whom Occult\r\nteaching calls Manasvin, the Wise, foremost of all, and who would have\r\nmade all men the _self‐conscious_ spiritually intellectual Beings they\r\nwill be, had they not been “cursed” to fall into generation, and to be\r\nreborn themselves as mortals for their neglect of duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStanza IV.—_Continued._\r\n\r\n\r\n15. SEVEN TIMES SEVEN SHADOWS(201) OF FUTURE MEN(202) (_A_) WERE(203)\r\nBORN, EACH OF HIS OWN COLOUR(204) AND KIND (_B_). EACH(205) INFERIOR TO\r\nHIS FATHER.(206) THE FATHERS, THE BONELESS, COULD GIVE NO LIFE TO BEINGS\r\nWITH BONES. THEIR PROGENY WERE BHÛTA,(207) WITH NEITHER FORM NOR MIND.\r\nTHEREFORE THEY ARE CALLED THE CHHÂYÂ(208) RACE(_C_).\r\n\r\n(_a_) Manu, as already remarked, comes from the root _man_, to think,\r\nhence a “thinker.” It is from this Sanskrit word very likely that sprung\r\nthe Latin _mens_, Mind, the Egyptian _Menes_, the “Master‐Mind,” the\r\nPythagorean _monas_, or conscious “thinking unit,” mind also, and even our\r\n_manas_ or mind, the fifth principle in man. Hence these Shadows are\r\ncalled _Amânasa_, “Mindless.”\r\n\r\nWith the Brâhmans, the Pitris are very sacred, because they are the\r\nProgenitors,(209) or Ancestors of men—the first Manushyas on this\r\nEarth—and offerings are made to them by the Brâhman when a son is born\r\nunto him. They are more honoured and their ritual is more important than\r\nthe worship of the Gods.(210)\r\n\r\nMay we not now search for a philosophical meaning in this dual group of\r\nProgenitors?\r\n\r\nThe Pitris being divided into _seven_ Classes, we have here the mystic\r\nnumber again. Nearly all the _Purânas_ agree that three of these are\r\nArûpa, formless, while four are Corporeal; the former being intellectual\r\nand spiritual, the latter material and devoid of intellect. Esoterically,\r\nit is the Asuras who form the first three Classes of Pitris—“born in the\r\nBody of Night”—whereas the other four were produced from the “Body of\r\nTwilight.” Their Fathers, the Gods, were doomed to be born fools on Earth,\r\naccording to the _Vâyu Purâna_. The legends are purposely mixed up and\r\nmade very hazy: the Pitris being in one the Sons of the Gods, and, in\r\nanother, those of Brahmâ; while a third makes them instructors of their\r\nown Fathers. It is the Hosts of the four material Classes who create men\r\nsimultaneously on the seven Zones.\r\n\r\nNow, with regard to the seven Classes of Pitris, each of which is again\r\ndivided into seven, a word to students and a query to the profane. That\r\nClass of the “Fire Dhyânîs,” which we identify on undeniable grounds with\r\nthe Agnishvâttas, is called in our school the “Heart” of the Dhyân‐\r\nChohanic Body, and is said to have incarnated in the Third Race of men and\r\nmade them perfect. The Esoteric Mystagogy speaks of the mysterious\r\nrelation existing between the hebdomadic essence or substance of this\r\nangelic Heart and that of man, whose every physical organ, and psychic,\r\nand spiritual function, is a reflection, so to say, a copy on the\r\nterrestrial plane, of the model or prototype _above_. Why, it is asked,\r\nshould there be such a strange repetition of the number seven in the\r\nanatomical structure of man? Why should the heart have _four lower_\r\ncavities and _three higher_ divisions, answering so strangely to the\r\nseptenary division of the human principles, separated into two groups, the\r\nhigher and the lower; and why should the same division be found in the\r\nvarious classes of Pitris, and especially our Fire Dhyânîs? For, as\r\nalready stated, these Beings fall into four Corporeal, or grosser, and\r\nthree Incorporeal, or subtler, “Principles,” or call them by any other\r\nname you please. Why do the seven nervous plexuses of the body radiate\r\nseven rays? Why are there these seven plexuses, and why seven distinct\r\nlayers in the human skin?\r\n\r\nSays the Commentary:\r\n\r\n_Having projected their Shadows and made men of one Element [Ether], the\r\nProgenitors reäscend to Mahâ‐Loka, whence they descend periodically, when\r\nthe World is renewed, to give birth to new Men._\r\n\r\n_The Subtle Bodies remain without understanding [Manas] until the advent\r\nof the Suras [Gods] now called Asuras [Not‐Gods]._\r\n\r\n“Not‐Gods,” for the Brâhmans, perhaps, but the highest “Breaths,” for the\r\nOccultist; since those Progenitors (Pitaras), the formless and the\r\nintellectual, refuse to build man, but endow him with Mind; the four\r\ncorporeal Classes creating only his body.\r\n\r\nThis is very plainly shown in various texts of the _Rig Veda_—the highest\r\nauthority for a Hindû of any sect whatever. Therein Asura means\r\n“spiritual, divine,” and the word is used as a synonym for Supreme Spirit,\r\nand the term Asura, in the sense of a “God,” is applied to Varuna and\r\nIndra and preëminently to Agni—the three having been in days of old the\r\nthree _highest_ Gods, before Brâhmanical Theo‐Mythology distorted the true\r\nmeaning of almost everything in the Archaic Scriptures. But, as the key is\r\nnow lost, the Asuras are hardly mentioned.\r\n\r\nIn the _Zend Avesta_ the same is found. In the Mazdean, or Magian,\r\nreligion, Asura is the Lord Asura Vishvavedas, the “all‐knowing” or\r\n“omniscient Lord”; and Asura Mazdhâ, becoming later Ahura Mazdhâ, is, as\r\nBenfey shows, “the Lord who bestows _Intelligence_”—Asura Medhâ and Ahura\r\nMazdâo.(211) Elsewhere in this work it is shown, on equally good\r\nauthority, that the Indo‐Iranian Asura was always regarded as _sevenfold_.\r\nThis fact, combined with the name Mazdhâ, as above, which makes of the\r\nsevenfold Asura the “Lord,” or “Lords” collectively “who bestow\r\n_Intelligence_,” connects the Amshaspands with the Asuras and with our\r\nincarnating Dhyân Chohans, as well as with the Elohim, and the seven\r\ninforming Gods of Egypt, Chaldæa, and every other country.\r\n\r\nWhy these “Gods” refused to create men is not, as stated in exoteric\r\naccounts, because their pride was too great to share the celestial power\r\nof their essence with the Children of Earth, but for reasons already\r\nsuggested. However, allegory has indulged in endless fancies and Theology\r\nhas taken advantage thereof in every country, to make out its case against\r\nthese First‐born, or the Logoi, and to impress it as a truth on the minds\r\nof the ignorant and credulous.(212)\r\n\r\nThe Christian system is not the only one which has degraded these Gods\r\ninto Demons. Zoroastrianism and even Brâhmanism have profited thereby to\r\nobtain hold over the people’s mind. Even in Chaldæan exotericism, Beings\r\nwho _refuse to create_, and are said to oppose thereby the Demiurgus, are\r\nalso denounced as Spirits of Darkness. The Suras, who win their\r\nintellectual independence, fight the Suras, who are devoid thereof and are\r\nshown as passing their lives in profitless ceremonial worship based on\r\nblind faith—a hint now ignored by the _orthodox_ Brâhmans—and forthwith\r\nthe former become _A_‐Suras. The First‐ and Mind‐born Sons of the Deity\r\nrefuse to create progeny, and are _cursed_ by Brahmâ to be _born as men_.\r\nThey are hurled _down to Earth_, which, later on, is transformed, in\r\ntheological dogma, into the _Infernal_ Regions. Ahriman destroys the Bull\r\ncreated by Ormazd—which is the emblem of terrestrial _illusive_ life, the\r\n“germ of sorrow”—and, forgetting that the perishing finite seed must die,\r\nin order that the plant of immortality, the plant of spiritual, eternal\r\nlife, should sprout and live, Ahriman is proclaimed the enemy, the\r\nopposing power, the Devil. Typhon cuts Osiris into fourteen pieces, in\r\norder to prevent him peopling the world and thus creating misery; and\r\nTyphon becomes, in the exoteric, theological teaching, the Power of\r\nDarkness. But all this is the exoteric shell. It is the worshippers of the\r\nlatter who attribute to disobedience and rebellion the effort and self‐\r\nsacrifice of those who would help men to their original status of divinity\r\nthrough _self‐conscious_ efforts; and it is these worshippers of _form_\r\nwho have made Demons of the Angels of Light.\r\n\r\nEsoteric Philosophy, however, teaches that _one‐third_(213) of the\r\nDhyânîs—_i.e._, the three Classes of the Arûpa Pitris, endowed with\r\nintelligence, “which is a formless breath, composed of _intellectual_ not\r\nelementary substances”(214)—was simply _doomed by the law of Karma and\r\nevolution to be re‐born_, or incarnated, on Earth.(215) Some of these were\r\nNirmânakâyas from other Manvantaras. Hence we see them, in all the\r\n_Purânas_, re‐appearing on this Globe, in the Third Manvantara—read Third\r\nRoot‐Race—as Kings, Rishis and Heroes. This tenet, being too philosophical\r\nand metaphysical to be grasped by the multitudes, was, as already stated,\r\ndisfigured by the priesthood for the purpose of preserving a hold over the\r\nformer through superstitious fear.\r\n\r\nThe supposed “Rebels,” then, were simply those who, compelled by Karmic\r\nlaw to drink the cup of gall to its last bitter drop, _had to incarnate_\r\nanew, and thus make responsible thinking entities of the astral statues\r\nprojected by their inferior brethren. Some are said to have refused,\r\nbecause they had not in them the requisite materials—_i.e._, an astral\r\nbody—for they were Arûpa. The refusal of others had reference to their\r\nhaving been Adepts and Yogîs of long past preceding Manvantaras; another\r\nmystery. But, later on, as Nirmânakâyas, they sacrificed themselves for\r\nthe good and salvation of the Monads which were waiting for their turn,\r\nand which otherwise would have had to linger for countless ages in\r\nirresponsible, animal‐like, though in appearance human, forms. It may be a\r\nparable and an allegory _within an allegory_. Its solution is left to the\r\nintuition of the student, if he only reads that which follows with his\r\n_spiritual_ eye.\r\n\r\nAs to their Fashioners or Ancestors—those Angels who, in the exoteric\r\nlegends, obeyed the law—they must be identical with the Barhishad Pitris,\r\nor the Pitri‐Devatâs, _i.e._, those possessed of the _physical creative\r\nfire_. They could only create, or rather clothe, the human Monads with\r\ntheir own astral Selves, but they could not make man in their image and\r\nlikeness. “Man must not be like one of us,” say the _Creative_ Gods,\r\nentrusted with the fabrication of the lower animal—but higher.(216) Their\r\ncreating the semblance of men out of their own divine Essence means,\r\nEsoterically, that it is they who became the First Race, and thus shared\r\nits destiny and further evolution. They _would_ not, simply because they\r\n_could_ not, give to man that sacred spark which burns and expands into\r\nthe flower of human reason and self‐consciousness, for they had it not to\r\ngive. This was left to that Class of Devas who became symbolized in Greece\r\nunder the name of Prometheus; to those who had nought to do with the\r\nphysical body, yet everything with the purely spiritual man.\r\n\r\nEach Class of Creators endows man with what it has to give: the one builds\r\nhis external form; the other gives him its essence, which later on becomes\r\nthe Human Higher Self owing to the _personal exertion of the individual_;\r\nbut they could not make men as they were themselves—perfect, because\r\nsinless; sinless, because having only the first, pale shadowy outlines of\r\nattributes, and these all perfect—from the human standpoint—white, pure\r\nand cold as the virgin snow. Where there is no struggle, there is no\r\nmerit. Humanity, “of the earth earthy,” was not destined to be created by\r\nthe Angels of the First Divine Breath. Therefore they are said to have\r\n_refused_ to create, and man had to be formed by more material\r\nCreators,(217) who, in their turn, could give only what they had in their\r\nown natures, and no more. Subservient to eternal law, the pure Gods could\r\nonly project out of themselves _shadowy_ men, a little less ethereal and\r\nspiritual, less _divine_ and _perfect_ than themselves—shadows still. The\r\nfirst Humanity, therefore, was a pale copy of its Progenitors; too\r\nmaterial, even in its ethereality, to be a hierarchy of Gods; too\r\nspiritual and pure to be Men—endowed as it is with every _negative_\r\n(nirguna) perfection. Perfection, to be fully such, must be born out of\r\nimperfection, the _incorruptible_ must grow out of the corruptible, having\r\nthe latter as its vehicle and basis and contrast. Absolute Light is\r\nabsolute Darkness, and _vice versâ_. In fact, there is neither Light nor\r\nDarkness in the realms of Truth. Good and Evil are twins, the progeny of\r\nSpace and Time, under the sway of Mâyâ. Separate them, by cutting off one\r\nfrom the other, and they will both die. Neither exists _per se_, since\r\neach has to be generated and created out of the other, in order to come\r\ninto being; both must be known and appreciated before becoming objects of\r\nperception, hence, in mortal mind, they must be divided.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, as the illusionary distinction exists, it requires a _lower_\r\nOrder of Creative Angels to “create” inhabited Globes—especially ours—or\r\nto deal with Matter on this earthly plane. The philosophical Gnostics were\r\nthe first to think so, in the historical period, and to invent various\r\nsystems upon this theory. Therefore in their schemes of creation, one\r\nalways finds their “Creators” occupying a place at the very foot of the\r\nladder of Spiritual Being. With them, those who created our Earth and its\r\nmortals were placed on the very limit of mâyâvic Matter, and their\r\nfollowers were taught to think—to the great disgust of the Church\r\nFathers—that for the creation of those wretched races, in a spiritual and\r\nmoral sense, which grace our Globe, no high Divinity could be made\r\nresponsible, but only Angels of a low Hierarchy,(218) to which Class they\r\nrelegated the Jewish God, Jehovah.\r\n\r\nMankinds different from the present are mentioned in all the ancient\r\nCosmogonies. Plato speaks, in the _Phædrus_, of a “winged” race of men.\r\nAristophanes, in Plato’s _Banquet_, speaks of a race androgynous and with\r\nround bodies. In _Pymander_, all the animal kingdom even is double‐sexed.\r\nThus it is said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The circuit having been accomplished, _the knot was loosened_ ...\r\n    and all the animals, which were equally androgynous, were _untied_\r\n    [separated] _together with man_ ... [for] ... the causes had to\r\n    produce effects on earth.(219)\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, in the ancient Quiché Manuscript, the _Popol Vuh_—published by the\r\nlate Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg—the first men are described as a race\r\n“whose sight was unlimited, and who knew all things at once”; thus showing\r\nthe _divine knowledge of Gods_, not mortals. The Secret Doctrine,\r\ncorrecting the unavoidable exaggerations of popular fancy, gives the facts\r\nas they are recorded in the archaic symbols.\r\n\r\n(_b_) These “Shadows” were born “each of his own colour and kind,” each\r\nalso “inferior to his Father,” or Creator, because the latter was a\r\ncomplete Being of his kind. The Commentaries refer the first sentence to\r\nthe colour or complexion of each human race thus evolved. In _Pymander_,\r\nthe Seven Primitive Men, created by Nature from the “Heavenly Man,” all\r\npartake of the qualities of the Seven “Governors,” or Rulers, who loved\r\nMan—their own reflection and synthesis.\r\n\r\nIn the Norse Legends, one recognizes in Asgard, the habitat of the Gods,\r\nas also in the Ases themselves, the same mystical Loci and\r\npersonifications woven into the popular “myths,” as in our Secret\r\nDoctrine; and we find them in the _Vedas_, the _Purânas_, the Mazdean\r\nScriptures and the _Kabalah_. The Ases of Scandinavia, the Rulers of the\r\nWorld which preceded ours, whose name means literally the “Pillars of the\r\nWorld,” its “Supports,” are thus identical with the Greek Cosmocratores,\r\nthe seven “Workmen” or Rectors of _Pymander_, the seven Rishis and Pitris\r\nof India, the seven Chaldæan Gods and seven Evil Spirits, the seven\r\nKabalistic Sephiroth, synthesized by the upper Triad, and even the seven\r\nPlanetary Spirits of the Christian Mystics. The Ases create the earth, the\r\nseas, the sky and the clouds, the whole visible world, from the remains of\r\nthe slain giant Ymir; but they do not create MAN, but only his form from\r\nthe Ask or Ash tree. It is Odin who endows him with life and soul, after\r\nLodur had given him blood and bones, and finally it is Hönir who furnishes\r\nhim with his intellect (Manas) and with his conscious senses.(220) The\r\nNorse Ask, the Hesiodic Ash‐tree, whence issued the men of the generation\r\nof bronze, the Third Root‐Race, and the Tzité tree of the _Popol Vuh_, out\r\nof which the Mexican _third_ race of men was created, are all one. This\r\nmay be plainly seen by any reader. But the Occult reason why the Norse\r\nYggdrasil, the Hindû Ashvattha, the Gogard, the Hellenic tree of life, and\r\nthe Tibetan Zampun, are one with the Kabalistic Sephirothic Tree, and even\r\nwith the Holy Tree made by Ahura Mazda, and the Tree of Eden—who among the\r\nWestern scholars can tell?(221) Nevertheless, the fruits of all those\r\n“Trees,” whether Pippala, or Haoma, or even the more prosaic Apple, are\r\nthe “plants of life,” in fact and verity. The prototypes of our races were\r\nall enclosed in the Microcosmic Tree, which grew and developed _within and\r\nunder_ the great mundane Macrocosmic Tree;(222) and the mystery is half\r\nrevealed in the _Dîrghotamas_, where it is said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Pippala, the sweet fruit of that tree upon which come _spirits who\r\n    love the science_, and where the gods produce all marvels.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs in the Gogard, among the luxuriant branches of all these Mundane Trees,\r\nthe “Serpent” dwells. But while the Macrocosmic Tree is the Serpent of\r\nEternity and of absolute Wisdom itself, those who dwell in the Microcosmic\r\nTree are the Serpents of the Manifested Wisdom. One is the One and All;\r\nthe others are its _reflected_ parts. The “Tree” is man himself, of\r\ncourse, and the Serpent dwelling in each, the conscious Manas, the\r\nconnecting link between Spirit and Matter, Heaven and Earth.\r\n\r\nEverywhere, it is the same. The “Creating” Powers produce Man, but fail in\r\ntheir final object. All these Logoi strive to endow man with _conscious_\r\nimmortal Spirit, reflected in the Mind (Manas) alone; they fail, and they\r\nare all represented as being punished for the failure, if not for the\r\nattempt. What is the nature of the punishment? A sentence of imprisonment\r\nin the lower or nether region, which is _our Earth, the lowest_ in its\r\nChain; an “Eternity”—meaning the duration of the Life‐cycle—in the\r\n_darkness_ of Matter, or _within animal Man_. It pleased the half ignorant\r\nand half designing Church Fathers to disfigure the graphic symbol. They\r\ntook advantage of the metaphor and allegory in every old religion to turn\r\nthem to the benefit of the new one. Thus man was transformed into the\r\ndarkness of a material Hell; his divine consciousness, obtained from his\r\nindwelling Principle, the Mânasa, or the incarnated Deva, became the\r\nglaring flames of the Infernal Region, and our Globe that Hell itself.\r\nPippala, Haoma, the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, were denounced as the\r\n_forbidden_ fruit, and the “Serpent of Wisdom,” the voice of reason and\r\nconsciousness, remained identified for ages with the Fallen Angel, which\r\nis the old Dragon, the Devil!\r\n\r\nThe same for the other high symbols. The Svastika, the most sacred and\r\nmystic symbol in India, the “Jaina Cross” as it is now called by the\r\nMasons, notwithstanding its direct connection, and even identity, with the\r\nChristian Cross, has become dishonoured in the same manner. It is the\r\n“devil’s sign,” we are told by the Indian missionaries. Does it not shine\r\non the head of the great Serpent of Vishnu, on the thousand‐headed Shesha‐\r\nAnanta, in the depths of Pâtâla, the Hindû Naraka or Hell? It does: but\r\nwhat is Ananta? As Shesha, it is the almost endless Manvantaric Cycle of\r\nTime, and becomes _Infinite_ Time itself, when called Ananta, the great\r\nSeven‐headed Serpent, on which rests Vishnu, the _Eternal Deity_, during\r\nPralayic inactivity. What has Satan to do with this highly metaphysical\r\nsymbol? The Svastika is the most philosophically scientific of all\r\nsymbols, as also the most comprehensible. It is the summary in a few lines\r\nof the whole work of “creation,” or evolution as one should rather say,\r\nfrom Cosmotheogony down to Anthropogony, from the indivisible unknown\r\nParabrahman to the humble Moneron of materialistic Science, whose _genesis\r\nis as unknown_ to that Science as is that of the All‐Deity Itself. The\r\nSvastika is found heading the religious symbols of every old nation. It is\r\nthe “Worker’s Hammer” in the Chaldæan _Book of Numbers_, the “Hammer,”\r\nabove referred to, in the _Book of Concealed Mystery_, “which striketh\r\nsparks from the flint” (Space), those sparks becoming Worlds. It is Thor’s\r\nHammer, the magic weapon forged by the Dwarfs against the Giants, or the\r\nPre‐cosmic Titanic Forces of Nature, which rebel and, while alive in the\r\nregion of Matter, will not be subdued by the Gods—the agents of Universal\r\nHarmony—but have first to be destroyed. This is why the World is formed\r\nout of the relics of the murdered Ymir. The Svastika is the Miölnir, the\r\n“Storm‐hammer”; and therefore it is said that when the Ases, the holy\r\nGods, after having been purified by fire—the fire of the passions and\r\nsuffering in their life‐incarnations—become fit to dwell in Ida in eternal\r\npeace, then Miölnir will become useless. This will be when the bonds of\r\nHel—the Goddess‐queen of the region of the Dead—will bind them no longer,\r\nfor the kingdom of evil will have passed away.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Surtur’s flames had not destroyed them, nor yet had the raging\r\n    waters [of the several deluges].... There were ... the sons of\r\n    Thor. They brought Miölnir with them, not as a weapon of war, but\r\n    as the hammer with which to consecrate the new heavens and the new\r\n    earth.(223)\r\n\r\n\r\nVerily many are its meanings! In the macrocosmic work, the “Hammer of\r\nCreation,” with its four arms bent at right angles, refers to the\r\ncontinual _motion_ and revolution of the invisible Kosmos of Forces. In\r\nthat of the manifested Cosmos and our Earth, it points to the rotation in\r\nthe Cycles of Time of the world’s axes and their equatorial belts; the two\r\nlines forming the Svastika 卐, meaning Spirit and Matter, the four hooks\r\nsuggesting the motion in the revolving cycles. Applied to the microcosm,\r\nMan, it shows him to be a link between Heaven and Earth; the right hand\r\nbeing raised at the end of a horizontal arm, the left pointing to the\r\nEarth. In the _Smaragdine Tablet_ of Hermes, the uplifted right hand is\r\ninscribed with the word “Solve,” the left with the word “Coagula.” It is\r\nat one and the same time an Alchemical, Cosmogonical, Anthropological, and\r\nMagical sign, with seven keys to its inner meaning. It is not too much to\r\nsay that the compound symbolism of this universal and most suggestive of\r\nsigns contains the key to the seven great mysteries of Kosmos. Born in the\r\nmystical conceptions of the early Âryans, and by them placed at the very\r\nthreshold of eternity, on the head of the serpent Ananta, it found its\r\nspiritual death in the scholastic interpretations of mediæval\r\nAnthropomorphists. It is the Alpha and the Omega of universal Creative\r\nForce, evolving from pure Spirit and ending in gross Matter. It is also\r\nthe key to the Cycle of Science, divine and human; and he who comprehends\r\nits full meaning is for ever liberated from the toils of Mahâ‐Mâyâ, the\r\ngreat Illusion and Deceiver. The Light that shines from under the Divine\r\nHammer, now degraded into the mallet or gavel of the Grand Masters of\r\nMasonic Lodges, is sufficient to dissipate the darkness of any human\r\nschemes or fictions.\r\n\r\nHow prophetic are the songs of the three Norse Goddesses, to whom the\r\nravens of Odin whisper of the past and the future, as they flutter round\r\nin their abode of crystal beneath the flowing river. The songs are all\r\nwritten down in the “Scrolls of Wisdom,” of which many are lost but some\r\nstill remain; and they repeat in poetical allegory the teachings of the\r\nArchaic Ages. To summarize from Dr. Wagner’s _Asgard and the Gods_,\r\nconcerning the “Renewal of the World,” which is a prophecy about the\r\nSeventh Race of our Round told in the past tense.\r\n\r\nThe Miölnir had done its duty in this Round, and:\r\n\r\n\r\n    On the field of Ida, the field of resurrection [for the Fifth\r\n    Round], the sons of the highest gods assembled, and _in them their\r\n    fathers rose again_ [the Egos of all their past incarnations].\r\n    They talked of the Past and the Present, and remembered the wisdom\r\n    and prophecies of their ancestors which had all been fulfilled.\r\n    Near them, but _unseen by them_, was the strong, the mighty One,\r\n    who rules all things, makes peace between those who are angry with\r\n    each other, and ordains the eternal laws that govern the world.\r\n    _They all knew he was there, they felt his presence and his power,\r\n    but were ignorant of his name. At his command the new earth rose\r\n    out of the waters_ [of Space]. To the south above the Field of\r\n    Ida, he made another heaven called Audlang, and further off, a\r\n    third, known as Widblain. Over Gimil’s cave a wondrous palace was\r\n    erected, which was covered with gold and shining bright in the\r\n    sun. [These are the three gradually ascending Globes of our\r\n    Chain.] There the gods were enthroned, as _they used to be_, and\r\n    they rejoiced in the restoration and in the better time. From\r\n    Gimil’s heights [the Seventh Globe, the highest and purest], they\r\n    looked down upon the happy descendants of Lif [and Lifthrasir, the\r\n    coming Adam and Eve of purified Humanity] and signed to them to\r\n    _climb up higher_, to _rise in knowledge and wisdom_, in piety and\r\n    in deeds of love, step by step, from one heaven to another, until\r\n    they were at last fit to be united to the divinities in the house\r\n    of All father.(224)\r\n\r\n\r\nHe who knows the doctrines of Esoteric Budhism, or Wisdom, though so\r\nimperfectly sketched hitherto, will see clearly the allegory contained in\r\nthe above.\r\n\r\nIts more philosophical meaning will be better understood if the reader\r\nthinks carefully over the myth of Prometheus. It is examined, further on,\r\nin the light of the Hindû Pramantha. Degraded into a purely physiological\r\nsymbol by some Orientalists, and taken in connection with terrestrial fire\r\nonly, their interpretation is an insult to every religion, including\r\nChristianity, whose greatest mystery is thus dragged down to Matter. The\r\n“friction” of divine Pramantha and Arani could suggest itself under this\r\nimage only to the brutal conceptions of the German Materialists—than whom\r\nthere are none worse. It is true that the Divine Babe, Agni with the\r\nSanskrit‐speaking Race, who became Ignis with the Latins, is born from the\r\nconjunction of Pramantha and Arani—the Svastika—during the sacrificial\r\nceremony. But what of that? Tvashtri (Vishvakarman) is the “divine artist\r\nand _carpenter_,”(225) and is also the Father of the Gods and of “Creative\r\nFire” in the _Vedas_. So ancient is the symbol and so sacred, that there\r\nis hardly an excavation made on the sites of old cities without its being\r\nfound. A number of such terra‐cotta discs, called _fusaïoles_, were found\r\nby Dr. Schliemann _under_ the ruins of ancient Troy. Both the forms,\r\n[Symbol: swastika with dots around the center] and [Symbol: Cross with dot\r\nin the middle], were excavated in great abundance; their presence being\r\none more proof that the ancient Trojans and their ancestors were pure\r\nAryans.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Chhâyâ, as already explained, is the Astral Image. It bears this\r\nmeaning in Sanskrit works. Thus Sanjnâ, Spiritual Consciousness, the wife\r\nof Sûrya, the Sun, is shown retiring into the jungle to lead an ascetic\r\nlife, and leaving behind to her husband her Chhâyâ, Shadow or Image.\r\n\r\n16. HOW ARE THE MANUSHYA(226) BORN? THE MANUS WITH MINDS, HOW ARE THEY\r\nMADE? (_A_) THE FATHERS(227) CALLED TO THEIR HELP THEIR OWN FIRE,(228)\r\nWHICH IS THE FIRE THAT BURNS IN EARTH. THE SPIRIT OF THE EARTH CALLED TO\r\nHIS HELP THE SOLAR FIRE.(229) THESE THREE(230) PRODUCED IN THEIR JOINT\r\nEFFORTS A GOOD RÛPA. IT(231) COULD STAND, WALK, RUN, RECLINE, OR FLY. YET\r\nIT WAS STILL BUT A CHHÂYÂ, A SHADOW WITH NO SENSE. (_B_) ...\r\n\r\n(_a_) Here an explanation again becomes necessary in the light and with\r\nthe help of the exoteric added to the Esoteric Scriptures. The Manushyas\r\n(Men) and the Manus are here equivalent to the Chaldæan Adam—this term not\r\nmeaning at all the first man, as with the Jews, or one solitary\r\nindividual, but Mankind collectively, as with the Chaldæans and Assyrians.\r\nIt is the four Orders or Classes of Dhyân Chohans out of the Seven, says\r\nthe Commentary, “_who were the Progenitors of the Concealed Man_”—_i.e._,\r\nthe subtle Inner Man. The Lha of the Moon, the Lunar Spirits, were, as\r\nalready stated, only the Ancestors of his Form, _i.e._, of the model\r\naccording to which Nature began her external work upon him. Thus Primitive\r\nMan was, when he appeared, only a senseless Bhûta(232) or “phantom.” This\r\n“creation” was a failure.\r\n\r\n(_b_) This attempt again was a failure. It allegorizes the vanity of\r\n_physical_ Nature’s unaided attempts to construct even a perfect\r\nanimal—let alone man. For the Fathers, the Lower Angels, are all Nature‐\r\nSpirits, and the higher Elementals also possess an intelligence of their\r\nown; but this is not enough to construct a _thinking_ man. “_Living_ Fire”\r\nwas needed, that Fire which gives the human mind its self‐perception and\r\nself‐consciousness, or Manas; and the progeny of Pârvaka and Shuchi are\r\nthe Animal‐Electric and Solar Fires, which create animals, and could thus\r\nfurnish only a physical living constitution to that first astral model of\r\nman. The first Creators, then, were the Pygmalions of Primeval Man: they\r\nfailed to animate the statue—_intellectually_.\r\n\r\nThis Stanza we shall see is very suggestive. It explains the mystery of,\r\nand fills the gap between, the Informing Principle in man—the Higher Self\r\nor Human Monad—and the Animal Monad, both one and the same, although the\r\nformer is endowed with _divine_ intelligence, the latter with\r\n_instinctual_ faculty alone. How is the difference to be explained, and\r\nthe presence of that Higher Self in man accounted for?\r\n\r\nSays the Commentary:\r\n\r\n_The Sons of Mahat are the quickeners of the human Plant. They are the\r\nWaters falling upon the arid soil of latent life, and the Spark that\r\nvivifies the human Animal. They are the Lords of Spiritual Life\r\nEternal.... In the beginning [in the Second Race] some [of the Lords] only\r\nbreathed of their essence into Manushya [men], and some took in man their\r\nabode._\r\n\r\nThis shows that not all men became incarnations of the “Divine Rebels,”\r\nbut only a few among them. The remainder had their fifth Principle simply\r\nquickened by the spark thrown into it, which accounts for the great\r\ndifference between the intellectual capacities of men and races. Had not\r\nthe “Sons of Mahat,” speaking allegorically, skipped the Intermediate\r\nWorlds, in their impulse toward intellectual freedom, the animal man would\r\nnever have been able to reach upward from this Earth, and attain through\r\nself‐exertion his ultimate goal. The Cyclic Pilgrimage would have had to\r\nbe performed through all the planes of existence half unconsciously, if\r\nnot entirely so, as in the case of the animals. It is owing to this\r\nrebellion of intellectual life against the morbid inactivity of pure\r\nspirit, that we are what we are—self‐conscious, thinking men, with the\r\ncapabilities and attributes of Gods in us, for good as much as for evil.\r\nHence the Rebels are our Saviours. Let the Philosopher ponder well over\r\nthis, and more than one mystery will become clear to him. It is only by\r\nthe attractive force of the contrasts that the two opposites—Spirit and\r\nMatter—can be cemented together on Earth, and, smelted in the fire of\r\nself‐conscious experience and suffering, find themselves wedded in\r\nEternity. This will reveal the meaning of many hitherto incomprehensible\r\nallegories, foolishly called “fables.”\r\n\r\nIt explains, to begin with, the statement made in _Pymander_, that the\r\n“Heavenly Man,” the “Son of the Father,” who partook of the nature and\r\nessence of the Seven Governors, or Creators and Rulers of the Material\r\nWorld,\r\n\r\n\r\n    Peeped through the Harmony, and breaking through the strength of\r\n    the [Seven] Circles [of Fire], so showed and made manifest the\r\n    downward‐borne nature.(233)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt explains every verse in the Hermetic narrative, as also the Greek\r\nallegory of Prometheus. Most important of all, it explains the many\r\nallegorical accounts about the “Wars in Heaven,” including that of\r\n_Revelation_ with respect to the Christian dogma of the “Fallen Angels.”\r\nIt explains the “Rebellion” of the oldest and highest Angels, and the\r\nmeaning of their being cast down from Heaven into the depths of Hell,\r\n_i.e._, Matter. It even solves the recent perplexity of the\r\nAssyriologists, who express their wonder through the late George Smith, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    My first idea of this part [of the rebellion] was that the war\r\n    with the powers of evil _preceded_ the Creation; I now think it\r\n    followed the account of the Fall.(234)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same work,(235) Mr. George Smith gives an engraving, from an early\r\nBabylonian Cylinder, of the Sacred Tree, the Serpent, man and woman. The\r\nTree has seven branches; _three_ on the man’s side, _four_ on that of the\r\nfemale. These branches are typical of the seven Root‐Races, in the _third_\r\nof which, at its very close, occurred the separation of the sexes and the\r\nso‐called Fall into generation. The three earliest Races were sexless,\r\nthen hermaphrodite; the other four, male and female, as distinct from each\r\nother. As the writer tells us:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The dragon, which, in the Chaldean account of the Creation, leads\r\n    man to sin, is the creature of Tiamat, the living principle of the\r\n    sea and of chaos ... which was opposed to the deities at the\r\n    creation of the world.(236)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an error. The Dragon is the male principle, or Phallus,\r\npersonified, or rather _animalized_; and Tiamat, “the embodiment of the\r\nspirit of chaos,” of the Deep, or Abyss, is the female principle, the\r\nWomb. The “spirit of chaos and disorder” refers to the mental perturbation\r\nwhich it led to. It is the sensual, attractive, magnetic principle which\r\nfascinates and seduces, the ever‐living active element which throws the\r\nwhole world into disorder, chaos and sin. The Serpent seduces the woman,\r\nbut it is the latter who seduces man, and both are included in the Karmic\r\ncurse, though only as a natural result of a cause produced. Says George\r\nSmith:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is clear that the dragon is included in the curse for the Fall,\r\n    and that the gods [the Elohim, jealous at seeing the man of clay\r\n    becoming a Creator in his turn, like all the animals] invoke on\r\n    the head of the human Race all the evils which afflict humanity.\r\n    Wisdom and knowledge shall injure him, he shall have family\r\n    quarrels, shall submit to tyranny, he will anger the gods ... he\r\n    shall be disappointed in his desires, he shall pour out _useless\r\n    prayer_, ... he shall commit future sin. No doubt subsequent lines\r\n    continue these topics, but again our narrative is broken, and it\r\n    only reopens where the gods are preparing for war with the powers\r\n    of evil, which are led by Tiamat (the woman).(237)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis account is omitted in _Genesis_, for monotheistic purposes. But it is\r\na mistaken policy—born no doubt of fear, and regard for dogmatic religion\r\nand its superstitions—to seek to restore the Chaldæan fragments by\r\n_Genesis_, whereas it is the latter, far younger than any of the\r\nfragments, which ought to be explained by the former.\r\n\r\n17. THE BREATH(238) NEEDED A FORM; THE FATHERS GAVE IT. THE BREATH NEEDED\r\nA GROSS BODY; THE EARTH MOULDED IT. THE BREATH NEEDED THE SPIRIT OF LIFE;\r\nTHE SOLAR LHAS BREATHED IT INTO ITS FORM. THE BREATH NEEDED A MIRROR OF\r\nITS BODY;(239) “WE GAVE IT OUR OWN!”—SAID THE DHYÂNÎS. THE BREATH NEEDED A\r\nVEHICLE OF DESIRES;(240) “IT HAS IT!”—SAID THE DRAINER OF WATERS.(241) BUT\r\nBREATH NEEDS A MIND TO EMBRACE THE UNIVERSE; “WE CANNOT GIVE THAT!”—SAID\r\nTHE FATHERS. “I NEVER HAD IT!”—SAID THE SPIRIT OF THE EARTH. “THE FORM\r\nWOULD BE CONSUMED WERE I TO GIVE IT MINE!”—SAID THE GREAT FIRE.(242)...\r\nMAN(243) REMAINED AN EMPTY SENSELESS BHÛTA.... THUS HAVE THE BONELESS\r\nGIVEN LIFE TO THOSE WHO(244) BECAME MEN WITH BONES IN THE THIRD.(245)\r\n\r\nAs a full explanation is found in the commentary on Stanza V, a few\r\nremarks will now suffice. The “Father” of primitive physical man, or of\r\nhis body, is the Vital Electric Principle residing in the Sun. The Moon is\r\nits “Mother,” because of that mysterious power in the Moon, which has as\r\ndecided an influence upon human gestation and generation, which it\r\nregulates, as it has on the growth of plants and animals. The “Wind” or\r\nEther, standing in this case for the agent of transmission by which those\r\ninfluences are carried down from the two luminaries and diffused upon\r\nearth, is referred to as the “Nurse”;(246) while “Spiritual Fire” alone\r\nmakes of man a divine and perfect entity.\r\n\r\nNow what is that “Spiritual Fire”? In Alchemy it is Hydrogen, in general;\r\nwhile in Esoteric actuality it is the emanation, or the Ray which proceeds\r\nfrom its Noumenon, the “Dhyân of the First Element.” Hydrogen is _gas_\r\nonly on our terrestrial plane. But even in Chemistry, Hydrogen “would be\r\nthe only existing form of matter, in our sense of the term,”(247) and is\r\nvery nearly allied to Protyle, which is our Layam. It is the father and\r\ngenerator, so to say, or rather the Upâdhi (basis), of both Air and Water,\r\nand is “fire, air and water,” in fact: _one_ under three aspects; hence\r\nthe chemical and alchemical trinity. In the world of manifestation, or\r\nMatter, it is the objective symbol and the material emanation from the\r\nsubjective and purely spiritual entitative Being in the region of Noumena.\r\nWell might Godfrey Higgins have compared Hydrogen to, and even identified\r\nit with, the To On, the “One” of the Greeks. For, as he remarks, Hydrogen\r\nis _not_ water, though it generates it; Hydrogen is not fire, though it\r\nmanifests or creates it; nor is it air, though air may be regarded as a\r\nproduct of the union of water and fire—since Hydrogen is found in the\r\naqueous element of the atmosphere. It is three in one.\r\n\r\nIf one studies comparative Theogony, it is easy to find that the secret of\r\nthese “Fires” was taught in the Mysteries of every ancient people,\r\npreëminently in Samothrace. There is not the smallest doubt that the\r\nKabiri, the most arcane of all the ancient Deities, Gods and Men, great\r\nDeities and Titans, are identical with the Kumâras and Rudras headed by\r\nKârttikeya—a Kumâra also. This is quite evident even exoterically; and\r\nthese Hindû Deities were, like the Kabiri, the _personified sacred Fires\r\nof the most Occult Powers of Nature_. The several branches of the Âryan\r\nRace, the Asiatic and the European, the Hindû and the Greek, did their\r\nbest to conceal their true nature, if not their importance. As in the case\r\nof the Kumâras, the number of the Kabiri is uncertain. Some say that there\r\nwere three or four only; others say seven. Axierus, Axiocersa, Axiocersus,\r\nand Casmilus may very well stand for the _alter egos_ of the four\r\nKumâras—Sanat‐Kumâra, Sananda, Sanaka, and Sanâtana. The former deities,\r\nwhose reputed father was Vulcan, were often confounded with the Dioscori,\r\nCorybantes, Anactes, etc.; just as the Kumâras, whose reputed father is\r\nBrahmâ—or rather, the “Flame of his Wrath,” which prompted him to perform\r\nthe ninth or Kaumâra Creation, resulting in Rudra or Nîlalohita (Shiva)\r\nand the Kumâras—were confounded with the Asuras, the Rudras, and the\r\nPitris, for the simple reason that they are all one—_i.e._, correlative\r\nForces and Fires. There is no space to describe these “Fires” and their\r\nreal meaning here, though we may attempt to do so if the rest of this work\r\nis ever published. Meanwhile a few more explanations may be added.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing are all mysteries which must be left to the personal\r\nintuition of the student for solution, rather than described. If he would\r\nlearn something of the secret of the Fires, let him turn to certain works\r\nof the Alchemists, who very correctly connect Fire with every Element, as\r\ndo the Occultists. The reader must remember that the Ancients considered\r\nReligion and the Natural Sciences along with Philosophy, as closely and\r\ninseparably linked together. Æsculapius was the Son of Apollo—the Sun or\r\nFire of Life; at once Helius, Pythius, and the God of oracular Wisdom. In\r\nexoteric religions, as much as in Esoteric Philosophy, the\r\nElements—especially Fire, Water, and Air—are made the Progenitors of our\r\n_five physical senses_, and hence are directly connected, in an Occult\r\nway, with them. These physical senses pertain even to a lower Creation\r\nthan the one called in the _Purânas_ Pratisarga, or “Secondary Creation.”\r\n“_Liquid Fire proceeds from Indiscrete Fire_,” says an Occult axiom.\r\n\r\n_The Circle is the Thought; the Diameter [or the line] is the Word; and\r\ntheir union is Life._\r\n\r\nIn the Kabalah, Bath‐Kol is the Daughter of the Divine Voice, or\r\nPrimordial Light, Shekinah. In the _Purânas_ and Hindû exotericism, Vâch,\r\nthe Voice, is the female Logos of Brahmâ—a permutation of Aditi,\r\nPrimordial Light. And if Bath‐Kol, in Jewish Mysticism, is an articulate\r\npræter‐natural voice from heaven, revealing to the “chosen people” the\r\nsacred traditions and laws, it is only because Vâch was called, before\r\nJudaism, the “Mother of the _Vedas_,” who entered into the Rishis and\r\ninspired them by her revelations; just as Bath‐Kol is said to have\r\ninspired the prophets of Israël and the Jewish High‐Priests. And both\r\nexist to this day, in their respective sacred symbologies, because the\r\nAncients associated Sound or Speech with the Ether of Space, of which\r\nSound is the characteristic. Hence Fire, Water and Air are the primordial\r\nCosmic Trinity.\r\n\r\n\r\n    I am thy Thought, thy God, more ancient than the Moist Principle,\r\n    the _Light that radiates within Darkness_ [Chaos], and the shining\r\n    Word of God [Sound] is the Son of the Deity.(248)\r\n\r\n\r\nThus we have to study well the “Primary Creation” before we can understand\r\nthe Secondary. The first Race had three _rudimentary_ Elements in it; and\r\n_no Fire_ as yet; because, with the Ancients, the evolution of man, and\r\nthe growth and development of his spiritual and physical senses, were\r\nsubordinate to the evolution of the Elements on the Cosmic plane of this\r\nEarth. All proceeds from Prabhavâpyaya, the evolution of the creative and\r\nsentient principles in the Gods, and even of the so‐called Creative Deity\r\nhimself. This is found in the names and appellations given to Vishnu in\r\nexoteric Scriptures. As the Orphic Protologos, he is called Pûrvaja,\r\n“pregenetic,” and the other names connect him in their descending order\r\nmore and more with Matter.\r\n\r\nThe following order on parallel lines may be found in the evolution of the\r\nElements and the Senses; or in Cosmic Terrestrial “Man” or “Spirit,” and\r\nmortal physical man:\r\n\r\n1. Ether ... Hearing ... Sound.\r\n2. Air ... Touch ... Sound and Touch.\r\n3. Fire, or Light ... Sight ... Sound, Touch and Colour.\r\n4. Water ... Taste ... Sound, Touch, Colour and Taste.\r\n5. Earth ... Smell ... Sound, Touch, Colour, Taste and Smell.\r\n\r\nAs seen, each Element adds to its own characteristics, those of its\r\npredecessor; as each Root‐Race adds the characterizing sense of the\r\npreceding Race. The same is true in the septenary “creation” of man, who\r\nevolves gradually in seven stages, and on the same principles, as will be\r\nshown further on.\r\n\r\nThus, while Gods, or Dhyân Chohans (Devas), proceed from the First\r\nCause—which is not Parabrahman, for the latter is the ALL CAUSE, and\r\ncannot be referred to as the “_First_ Cause,”—which First Cause is called\r\nin the Brâhmanical Books Jagad‐Yoni, the “Womb of the World,” mankind\r\nemanates from these active agents in Kosmos. But men, during the First and\r\nSecond Races, were not physical beings, but merely _rudiments_ of the\r\nfuture men; Bhûtas, which proceeded from Bhûtâdi, “origin,” or the\r\n“original place whence sprang the Elements.” Hence they proceeded with all\r\nthe rest from Prabhavâpyaya, “the place whence is the origination, and\r\ninto which is the resolution of all things,” as explained by the\r\nCommentator on the _Vishnu Purâna_. Whence also our physical senses.\r\nWhence even the highest “created” Deity itself, in our Philosophy. As one\r\nwith the Universe, whether we call him Brahmâ, Îshvara, or Purusha, he is\r\na Manifested Deity—hence “created,” or limited and conditioned. This is\r\neasily proven, even from the exoteric teachings.\r\n\r\nAfter being called the _incognizable_, eternal Brahma (neuter or\r\nabstract), the Pundarîkâksha, “supreme and imperishable glory,” once that\r\ninstead of Sadaika‐Rûpa, “changeless” or “immutable” Nature, he is\r\naddressed as Ekâneka‐Rûpa, “both single and manifold,” he, the Cause,\r\nbecomes merged with his own effects; and his names, if placed in Esoteric\r\norder, show the following descending scale:\r\n\r\nMahâpurusha or Paramâtman: Supreme Spirit.\r\nÂtman or Pûrvaja (Protologos): The Living Spirit of Nature.\r\nIndriyâtman, or Hrishîkesha: Spiritual or Intellectual Soul (one with the\r\n            senses).\r\nBhûtâtman: The Living, or Life Soul.\r\nKshetrajña: Embodied Soul, or the Universe of Spirit and Matter.\r\nBhrântidarshanatah: False Perception—Material Universe.\r\n\r\nThe last name means something perceived or conceived of, owing to false\r\nand erroneous apprehension, as a material form, but is, in fact, only\r\nMâyâ, Illusion, as all is in our physical universe.\r\n\r\nIt is in strict analogy with the attributes of this Brahma in both the\r\nspiritual and material worlds, that the evolution of the Dhyân‐Chohanic\r\nEssences takes place; the characteristics of the latter being reflected,\r\nin their turn, in Man, collectively, and in each of his principles; _every\r\none of which contains in itself, in the same progressive order, a portion\r\nof their various __“__Fires__”__ and Elements_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStanza V. The Evolution of the Second Race.\r\n\r\n\r\n    18. The Sons of Yoga. 19. The Sexless Second Race. 20. The Sons of\r\n    the “Sons of Twilight.” 21. The “Shadow,” or the Astral Man,\r\n    retires within, and man develops a Physical Body.\r\n\r\n\r\n18. THE FIRST(249) WERE THE SONS OF YOGA. THEIR SONS, THE CHILDREN OF THE\r\nYELLOW FATHER AND THE WHITE MOTHER.\r\n\r\nIn the later Commentary, the sentence is translated:\r\n\r\n_The Sons of the Sun and of the Moon, the nursling of Ether [or the\r\n__“__Wind__”__] (a)_....\r\n\r\n_They were the shadows of the Shadows of the Lords (b). They [the shadows]\r\nexpanded. The Spirits of the Earth clothed them; the Solar Lhas warmed\r\nthem [__i.e.__, preserved the Vital Fire in the nascent physical Forms].\r\nThe Breaths had life, but had no understanding. They had no Fire or Water\r\nof their own (c)._\r\n\r\n(_a_) Remember in this connection the _Tabula Smaragdina_ of Hermes, the\r\nEsoteric meaning of which has seven keys to it. The Astro‐chemical is well\r\nknown to students, the Anthropological may now be given. The “One Thing”\r\nmentioned in it is Man. It is said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Father of that One Only Thing is the Sun; its Mother the Moon;\r\n    the Wind carries it in his bosom, and its Nurse is the Spirituous\r\n    Earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Occult rendering of the same it is added: “and _Spiritual_ Fire is\r\nits instructor [Guru].”\r\n\r\nThis Fire is the Higher Self, the Spiritual Ego, or that which is\r\neternally reïncarnating under the influence of its lower personal Selves,\r\nchanging with every re‐birth, full of Tanha or desire to live. It is a\r\nstrange law of Nature that, on this plane, the higher (Spiritual) Nature\r\nshould be, so to say, in bondage to the lower. Unless the Ego takes refuge\r\nin the Âtman, the ALL‐SPIRIT, and merges entirely into the essence\r\nthereof, the personal Ego may goad it to the bitter end. This cannot be\r\nthoroughly understood unless the student makes himself familiar with the\r\nmystery of evolution, which proceeds on triple lines—Spiritual, Psychic\r\nand Physical.\r\n\r\nThat which propels towards, and forces evolution, _i.e._, compels the\r\ngrowth and development of Man towards perfection, is (_a_) the Monad, or\r\nthat which acts in it unconsciously through a Force inherent in itself;\r\nand (_b_) the lower Astral Body or the _Personal_ Self. The former,\r\nwhether imprisoned in a vegetable or an animal body, is endowed with, is\r\nindeed itself, that Force. Owing to its identity with the ALL‐FORCE,\r\nwhich, as said, is inherent in the Monad, it is all‐potent on the Arûpa,\r\nor formless plane. On our plane, its essence being too pure, it remains\r\nall‐potential, but individually becomes inactive. For instance, the rays\r\nof the Sun, which contribute to the growth of vegetation, do not select\r\nthis or that plant to shine upon. Uproot the plant and transfer it to a\r\npiece of soil where the sunbeam cannot reach it, and the latter will not\r\nfollow it. So with the Âtman: unless the Higher Self or Ego gravitates\r\ntowards its Sun—the Monad—the Lower Ego, or _Personal_ Self, will have the\r\nupper hand in every case. For it is this Ego, with its fierce selfishness\r\nand animal desire to live a senseless life (Tanha), which is the “maker of\r\nthe tabernacle,” as Buddha calls it in the _Dhammapada_.(250) Hence the\r\nexpression, the Spirits of the Earth clothed the shadows and expanded\r\nthem. To these “Spirits” belong temporarily the human Astral Selves; and\r\nit is they who give, or build, the physical tabernacle of man, for the\r\nMonad and its conscious principle, Manas, to dwell in. But the “Solar”\r\nLhas, or Spirits, warm the Shadows. This is physically and literally true;\r\nmetaphysically, or on the psychic and spiritual plane, it is equally true\r\nthat the Âtman alone _warms_ the Inner Man; _i.e._, it enlightens it with\r\nthe Ray of Divine Life and alone is able to impart to the Inner Man, or\r\nthe Reïncarnating Ego, its immortality. Thus, we shall find, for the first\r\nthree and a half Root‐Races, up to the middle or turning point, it is the\r\nAstral Shadows of the “Progenitors,” the Lunar Pitris, which are the\r\nformative powers in the Races, and which build and gradually force the\r\nevolution of the physical form towards perfection—this, at the cost of a\r\nproportionate loss of Spirituality. Then, from the turning point, it is\r\nthe Higher Ego, or Incarnating Principle, the Nous or Mind, which reigns\r\nover the Animal Ego, and rules it whenever it is not carried down by the\r\nlatter. In short, Spirituality is on its ascending arc, and the animal or\r\nphysical impedes it from steadily progressing on the path of its\r\nevolution, only when the selfishness of the Personality has so strongly\r\ninfected the real Inner Man with its lethal _virus_, that the upward\r\nattraction has lost all its power on the thinking reasonable man. In sober\r\ntruth, vice and wickedness are an _abnormal, unnatural_ manifestation, at\r\nthis period of our human evolution—at least they ought to be so. The fact\r\nthat mankind was never more selfish and vicious than it is now—civilized\r\nnations having succeeded in making of the former an ethical\r\ncharacteristic, of the latter an art—is an additional proof of the\r\nexceptional nature of the phenomenon.\r\n\r\nThe entire scheme is in the _Chaldæan Book of Numbers_, and even in the\r\n_Zohar_, if one only understands the meaning of the apocalyptic hints.\r\nFirst comes Ain Suph, the “Concealed of the Concealed,” then the _Point_,\r\nSephira and the later Sephiroth; then the Atzilatic World, a _World of\r\nEmanations_ that gives birth to three other Worlds—the first the Briatic\r\nWorld called the Throne, the abode of pure Spirits; the second, the _World\r\nof Formation_, or Jetziratic, the habitat of the Angels who sent forth the\r\nThird, or _World of Action_, the Asiatic World, which is the Earth or\r\n_our_ World; and yet it is said of this World—also called Kliphoth,\r\ncontaining the (six other) Spheres, נלגלים, and Matter—that it is the\r\nresidence of the “Prince of Darkness.” This is as clearly stated as can\r\nbe; for Metatron, the Angel of the second Briatic World, the first\r\nhabitable World, means Messenger, Ἄγγελος, Angel, called the great\r\nTeacher; and under him are the Angels of the third World, or Jetziratic,\r\nwhose ten and seven classes are the Sephiroth,(251) of whom it is said\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n\r\n    They inhabit or vivify this world as essential [_entities_ and]\r\n    _intelligences_, and their _correlates_ and logical _contraries_\r\n    inhabit the third habitable world, called the Asiatic.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese “contraries” are called the “Shells,” קליפות, or Demons,(252) who\r\ninhabit the seven habitations called Sheba Hachaloth, which are simply the\r\nseven Zones of our Globe.(253) Their prince is called in the Kabalah\r\nSamaël, the Angel of Death, who is also the seducing Serpent Satan; but\r\nthis Satan is also Lucifer, the bright Angel of Light, the Light‐ and\r\nLife‐bringer, the “Soul” alienated from the Holy Ones, the other Angels,\r\nand for a period, _anticipating the time_ when they would descend on Earth\r\nto incarnate in their turn.\r\n\r\nThe _Book of Wisdom_ teaches that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    All Souls [Monads] are preëxistent in the Worlds of\r\n    Emanations.(254)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the _Zohar_ teaches that in the “Soul” is the _real man_, _i.e._, the\r\nEgo and the conscious _I am_, the Manas.\r\n\r\nSays Josephus, repeating the belief of the Essenes,\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Souls] descend from the pure air to be _chained to bodies_.(255)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd Philo states that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The air was full of [Souls], and that those which were nearest the\r\n    earth, descending to be tied to mortal bodies, return back to\r\n    bodies, being desirous to live in them.(256)\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause through, and in, the human form they will become _progressive_\r\nBeings, whereas the nature of the Angel is purely _intransitive_;\r\ntherefore Man has in him the potency of transcending the faculties of the\r\nAngels. Hence the Initiates in India say that it is the Brâhman, the\r\nTwice‐born, who rules the Gods or Devas; and Paul repeated it in his\r\n_Epistle to the Corinthians_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Know ye not that we [the Initiates] shall judge angels?(257)\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, it is shown in every ancient Scripture and Cosmogony that man\r\nevolved primarily as a _luminous incorporeal form_, over which, like\r\nmolten brass poured into the model of the sculptor, the physical frame of\r\nhis body was built by, through and from, the lower forms and types of\r\nanimal terrestrial life. Says the _Zohar_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Soul and the _Form_ when descending on Earth put on an earthly\r\n    garment.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis protoplastic body was not formed of that matter of which our mortal\r\nframes are fashioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n    When Adam dwelled in the garden of Eden, he was dressed in the\r\n    celestial garment, which is the garment of heavenly light ...\r\n    _light of that light which was used in the garden of Eden_.(258)\r\n    Man [the Heavenly Adam] was _created_ by the ten Sephiroth of the\r\n    Jetziratic World, and by their _common power_ the seven Angels of\r\n    a still lower World engendered the Earthly Adam. First Samaël\r\n    fell, and then _deceiving_ (?) man, caused his fall also.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) The sentence, “they were the shadows of the Shadows of the\r\nLords”—_i.e._, the Progenitors created man out of their own Astral\r\nBodies—explains a universal belief. The Devas are credited in the East\r\nwith having no “shadows” of their own. “The Devas cast no shadows,” and\r\nthis is the sure sign of a _good holy Spirit_.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Why had they “no Fire or Water of their own”?(259) Because that\r\nwhich Hydrogen is to the elements and gases on the objective plane, its\r\nNoumenon is in the world of mental or subjective phenomena; since its\r\ntrinitarian latent nature is mirrored in its three active emanations from\r\nthe three higher principles in man, namely, Spirit, Soul, and Mind, or\r\nÂtmâ, Buddhi, and Manas. It is the spiritual and also the material human\r\nbasis. Rudimentary man, having been nursed by the “Air” or the “Wind,”\r\nbecomes the perfect man later on; when, with the development of “Spiritual\r\nFire,” the Noumenon of the “Three in One” within his Self, he acquires\r\nfrom his Inner Self, or Instructor, the Wisdom of Self‐Consciousness,\r\nwhich he does not possess in the beginning. Thus here again Divine Spirit\r\nis symbolized by the Sun or Fire; Divine Soul by Water and the Moon, both\r\nstanding for the Father and Mother of Pneuma, the Human Soul, or Mind,\r\nsymbolized by the Wind or Air, for Pneuma, means “Breath.”\r\n\r\nHence in the _Smaragdine Tablet_, disfigured by Christian hands:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Superior agrees with the Inferior; and the Inferior with the\r\n    Superior; to effect that one truly wonderful work—[which is Man].\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the Secret Work of Chiram, or King Hiram in the Kabalah, “one in\r\nessence, but three in aspect,” is the Universal Agent or Lapis\r\nPhilosophorum. The culmination of the Secret Work is Spiritual Perfect\r\nMan, at one end of the line; the union of the three Elements is the Occult\r\nSolvent in the “Soul of the World,” the Cosmic Soul or Astral Light, at\r\nthe other; and, on the material plane, it is Hydrogen in its relation to\r\nthe other gases. The TO ON, truly; the ONE “whom no person has seen except\r\nthe Son”; this sentence applying both to the metaphysical and physical\r\nKosmos, and to the spiritual and material Man. For how could the latter\r\nunderstand the TO ON, the “One Father,” if his Manas, the “Son,” does not\r\nbecome (_as_) “One with the Father,” and through this absorption receive\r\nenlightenment from the divine “Instructor,” or Guru—Âtmâ‐Buddhi?\r\n\r\nAs says the Commentary:\r\n\r\n_If thou would’st understand the_ SECONDARY [“Creation,” so‐called], _O\r\nLanoo, thou should’st first study its relation to the_ PRIMARY.(260)\r\n\r\nThe First Race had three Elements, but no _Living_ Fire. Why? Because:\r\n\r\n“We say _four_ Elements, my Son, but ought to say three,” says Hermes\r\nTrismegistus. “In the Primary Circle,” or Creation that which is marked\r\n[Symbol: Like a large letter H, with dots above and below, and tildes\r\nabove and below] reads “Root,” as in the Secondary likewise.\r\n\r\nThus in Alchemy or Western Hermeticism—a variant on Eastern Esotericism—we\r\nfind:\r\n\r\nSulphur ... Flamma ... Spiritus\r\nMercury ... Natura ... Aqua\r\nSalt ... Mater ... Sanguis\r\n\r\nAnd these three are all quaternaries completed by their Root, Fire. The\r\nSpirit, beyond Manifested Nature, is the Fiery BREATH in its absolute\r\nUnity. In the Manifested Universe, it is the Central Spiritual Sun, the\r\nelectric Fire of all Life. In our System it is the visible Sun, the Spirit\r\nof Nature, the terrestrial God. And in, on, and around the Earth, the\r\nfiery spirit thereof—Air, fluidic Fire; Water, liquid Fire; Earth, solid\r\nFire. All is Fire—Ignis, in its ultimate constitution, or I, the root of\r\nwhich is 0 (nought) in our conceptions, the All in Nature and its Mind.\r\n“Pro‐Metor” is divine Fire. It is the Creator, the Destroyer, the\r\nPreserver. The primitive names of the Gods are all connected with fire,\r\nfrom Agni, the Âryan, to the Jewish God who is a “consuming fire.” In\r\nIndia, God is called in various dialects, Eashoor, Esur, Iswur, and\r\nÎshvara, in Sanskrit, the Lord, from Isha, but this is primarily the name\r\nof Shiva, the Destroyer; and the three chief Vedic Gods are Agni (Ignis),\r\nVâyu, and Sûrya—Fire, Air, and the Sun, three Occult degrees of Fire. In\r\nthe Hebrew, אזא (Aza) means to “illuminate,” and אשא (Asha) is “Fire.” In\r\nOccultism, to “kindle a fire” is synonymous to evoking one of the three\r\ngreat Fire‐powers, or to “call on God.” In Sanskrit the root Ush is fire\r\nor heat; and the Egyptian word Osiris is compounded, as shown by\r\nSchelling, of the two primitives Aish and Asr, or a “fire‐enchanter.”\r\nAesar in the old Etruscan meant a God, being perhaps derived from Asura of\r\nthe _Vedas_. Îshvara is an analogous term, as Dr. Kenealy thought, who\r\nquotes the _Bhagavad Gitâ_ to the effect that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Îshvara resides in every mortal being and puts in motion, by his\r\n    supernatural powers, all things which mount on the wheel of time.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the Creator and the Destroyer, truly.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The primitive Fire was supposed to have an insatiable appetite for\r\n    devouring. Maximus of Tyre relates that the ancient Persians threw\r\n    into the fire combustible matter crying, _Devour, O Lord!_ In the\r\n    Irish language _easam_, or _asam_, means to _make_ or _create_.\r\n\r\n    [And] _Aesar_ was the name also of one of the ancient Irish gods;\r\n    the literal meaning of the word is “to kindle a fire.”(261)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Christian Kabalists and Symbologists who disfigured\r\n_Pymander_—prominent among them the Bishop of Ayre, François de Tours, in\r\nthe 16th century—divide the Elements in the following way:\r\n\r\n_The four Elements formed from divine Substances and the Spirits of the\r\nSalts of Nature represented by_:\r\n\r\n[Symbol: Root symbol] ... St. Matthew ... Angel‐Man ... Water (Jesus‐\r\n            Christ, Angel‐Man, Mikael)\r\nΑ‐Ω ... St. Mark ... The Lion ... Fire\r\nΕ‐Υ ... St. Luke ... The Bull ... Earth\r\nΙ‐Ο ... St. John ... The Eagle ... Air(262)\r\nΗ ... _The Quintessence_, Ἡ ΦΛΟΞ, _Flamma‐Virgo_ [Virgin Oil], _Flamma\r\n            Durissima_, _Virgo_, _Lucis Æterna Mater_.\r\n\r\nThe First Race of men were, then, simply the Images, the Astral Doubles,\r\nof their Fathers, who were the pioneers, or the most progressed Entities\r\nfrom a preceding though _lower_ Sphere, the shell of which is now our\r\nMoon. But even this shell is all‐potential, for, the Moon having generated\r\nthe Earth, its _phantom_, attracted by magnetic affinity, sought to form\r\nits first inhabitants, the pre‐human monsters. To assure himself of this,\r\nthe student has again to turn to the Chaldæan Fragments, and read what\r\nBerosus says. Berosus obtained his information, he tells us, from Ea, the\r\nmale‐female Deity of Wisdom. While the Gods were generated in the\r\nandrogynous bosom of this Wisdom (Svabhâvat, Mother‐Space), its\r\nreflections became on Earth the woman Omorôka, who is the Chaldæan\r\nThavatth (or Thalatth), the Greek Thalassa, the Deep or the Sea, which\r\nEsoterically and even exoterically is the _Moon_. It was the Moon\r\n(Omorôka) who presided over the monstrous creation of nondescript beings\r\nwhich were slain by the Dhyânîs.(263)\r\n\r\nEvolutionary law compelled the Lunar Fathers to pass, in their monadic\r\ncondition, through all the forms of life and being on this Globe; but at\r\nthe end of the Third Round, they were already human in their divine\r\nnature, and were thus called upon to become the creators of the forms\r\ndestined to fashion the tabernacles of the less progressed Monads, whose\r\nturn it was to incarnate. These “Forms” are called “Sons of Yoga,” because\r\nYoga—union with Brahmâ, exoterically—is the supreme condition of the\r\npassive infinite Deity, since it contains all the divine energies and is\r\nthe essence of Brahmâ, who is said, as Brahmâ, to create everything\r\nthrough Yoga power. Brahmâ, Vishnu and Shiva are the most powerful\r\nenergies of God, Brahma (Neuter), says a Paurânic text. Yoga here is the\r\nsame as Dhyâna, which word is again synonymous with Yoga in the Tibetan\r\ntext, where the “Sons of Yoga” are called “Sons of Dhyâna,” or of that\r\nabstract meditation through which the Dhyâni‐Buddhas create their\r\ncelestial sons, the Dhyâni‐Bodhisattvas.\r\n\r\n\r\n    All the creatures in the world have each a superior above. This\r\n    superior, whose inner pleasure it is _to emanate into them_,\r\n    cannot impart efflux until they have adored [_i.e._, meditated as\r\n    during Yoga].(264)\r\n\r\n\r\n19. THE SECOND RACE (WAS) THE PRODUCT BY BUDDING AND EXPANSION, THE A‐\r\nSEXUAL(265) FROM THE SEXLESS.(266) THUS WAS, O LANOO, THE SECOND RACE\r\nPRODUCED.\r\n\r\nWhat will be most contested by scientific authorities is this A‐sexual\r\nRace, the Second, the Fathers of the “Sweat‐born” so‐called, and perhaps\r\nstill more the Third Race, the “Egg‐born” Androgynes. These two modes of\r\nprocreation are the most difficult to comprehend, especially for the\r\nWestern mind. It is evident that no explanation can be attempted for those\r\nwho are not students of Occult Metaphysics. European language has no words\r\nto express things which Nature repeats no more at this stage of evolution,\r\nthings which therefore can have no meaning for the Materialist. But there\r\nare analogies. It is not denied that in the beginning of physical\r\nevolution there must have been processes in Nature, spontaneous\r\ngeneration, for instance, now extinct, which are repeated in other forms.\r\nThus we are told that microscopic research shows no permanence of any\r\nparticular mode of reproducing life. For it shows that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The same organism may run through various metamorphoses in the\r\n    course of its life‐cycle, during some of which it may be _sexual_,\r\n    and in others _a‐sexual_, _i.e._, it may reproduce itself\r\n    alternately by the coöperation of two beings of opposite sex, and\r\n    also by fissure or _budding_ from one being only, which is of no\r\n    sex.(267)\r\n\r\n\r\n“Budding” is the very word used in the Stanza. How could these Chhâyâs\r\nreproduce themselves otherwise; viz., procreate the Second Race, since\r\nthey were ethereal, a‐sexual, and even devoid, as yet, of the vehicle of\r\ndesire, or Kâma Rûpa, which evolved only in the Third Race? They evolved\r\nthe Second Race unconsciously, as do some plants. Or, perhaps, as the\r\nAmœba, only on a more ethereal, impressive, and larger scale. If, indeed,\r\nthe cell‐theory applies equally to Botany and Zoology, and extends to\r\nMorphology, as well as to the Physiology of organisms, and if the\r\nmicroscopic cells are looked upon by Physical Science as independent\r\nliving beings—just as Occultism regards the “Fiery Lives”—there is no\r\ndifficulty in the conception of the primitive process of procreation.\r\n\r\nConsider the first stages of the development of a germ‐cell. Its nucleus\r\ngrows, changes, and forms a double cone or spindle, thus, [Symbol: Large X\r\nwith horizontal lines across tops and bottoms] _within_ the cell. This\r\nspindle approaches the surface of the cell, and one half of it is\r\n_extruded_ in the form of what are called the “polar cells.” These polar\r\ncells _now_ die, and the embryo develops from the growth and segmentation\r\nof the remaining part of the nucleus which is _nourished_ by the substance\r\nof the cell. Then why could not beings have lived thus, and been created\r\nin _this_ way—at the very beginning of _human and mammalian evolution_?\r\n\r\nThis may, perhaps, serve as an analogy to give some idea of the process by\r\nwhich the Second Race was formed from the First.\r\n\r\nThe Astral Form clothing the Monad was surrounded, as it still is, by its\r\negg‐shaped sphere of Aura, which here corresponds to the substance of the\r\ngerm‐cell or Ovum. The Astral Form itself is the nucleus, now, as then,\r\ninstinct with the Principle of Life.\r\n\r\nWhen the season of reproduction arrives, the _Sub_‐astral “extrudes” a\r\nminiature of itself from the egg of surrounding Aura. This germ grows and\r\nfeeds on the Aura till it becomes fully developed, when it gradually\r\nseparates from its parent, carrying with it its own sphere of Aura; just\r\nas we see living cells reproducing their like by growth and subsequent\r\ndivision into two.\r\n\r\nThe analogy with the “polar cells” would seem to hold good, since their\r\ndeath would _now_ correspond to the change introduced by the separation of\r\nthe sexes, when gestation _in utero_, _i.e._, within the cell, became the\r\nrule.\r\n\r\nAs the Commentary tells us:\r\n\r\n\r\n    _The early Second [Root] Race were the Fathers of the __“__Sweat‐\r\n    born__”__; the later Second [Root] Race were __“__Sweat‐born__”__\r\n    themselves._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis passage from the Commentary refers to the work of evolution from the\r\nbeginning of a Race to its close. The “Sons of Yoga,” or the Primitive\r\nAstral Race, had seven stages of evolution _racially_, or collectively; as\r\nevery individual Being in it had, and has now. It is not Shakespeare only\r\nwho divided the ages of man into a series of seven, but Nature herself.\r\nThus the first Sub‐races of the Second Race were born at first by the\r\nprocess described on the law of analogy; while the last began gradually,\r\n_pari passu_ with the evolution of the human body, to be formed otherwise.\r\nThe process of reproduction had seven stages also in each Race, each\r\ncovering æons of time. What Physiologist or Biologist can tell whether the\r\npresent mode of generation, with all its phases of gestation, is older\r\nthan half a million, or at most one million of years, since their cycle of\r\nobservation began hardly half a century ago?\r\n\r\nPrimeval human Hermaphrodites are a fact in Nature well known to the\r\nAncients, and form one of Darwin’s greatest perplexities. Yet there is\r\ncertainly no impossibility, but, on the contrary, a great probability that\r\nhermaphroditism existed in the evolution of the early Races; while on the\r\ngrounds of analogy, and on that of the existence of one universal law in\r\nphysical evolution, acting indifferently in the construction of plant,\r\nanimal, and man, it must be so. The mistaken theories of Monogenesis, and\r\nthe descent of man from the mammal, instead of the mammals from man, are\r\nfatal to the completeness of evolution as taught in modern schools on\r\nDarwinian lines, and they will have to be abandoned in view of the\r\ninsuperable difficulties which they encounter. Occult tradition—if the\r\nterms Science and Knowledge are denied in this particular to Antiquity—can\r\nalone reconcile the inconsistencies and fill the gap. Says a Talmudic\r\naxiom:\r\n\r\n\r\n    If thou wilt know the invisible, open thine eyes wide on the\r\n    visible.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the _Descent of Man_ occurs the following passage, which shows how near\r\nDarwin came to the acceptance of this ancient teaching.\r\n\r\n\r\n    It has long been known that in the vertebrate kingdom one sex\r\n    bears rudiments of various accessory parts, appertaining to the\r\n    reproductive system, which properly belong to the opposite sex....\r\n    Some remote progenitor of the whole vertebrate kingdom appears to\r\n    have been hermaphrodite or androgynous.(268) But here we encounter\r\n    a singular difficulty. _In the mammalian class the males possess\r\n    rudiments of a uterus with the adjacent passages in the vesiculæ\r\n    prostaticæ; they bear also rudiments of mammæ, and some male\r\n    marsupials have traces of a marsupial sac._ Other analogous facts\r\n    could be added. Are we, then, to suppose that some extremely\r\n    ancient mammal continued androgynous, after it had acquired the\r\n    chief distinctions of its class, and therefore after it had\r\n    diverged from the lower classes of the vertebrate kingdom? This\r\n    seems very improbable,(269) _for we have to look to fishes, the\r\n    lowest of all the classes, to find any still existent androgynous\r\n    forms_.(270)\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin is evidently strongly disinclined to adopt the hypothesis which\r\nthe facts so forcibly suggest, viz., that of a primeval androgynous stem\r\nfrom which the Mammalia sprang. His explanation runs:\r\n\r\n\r\n    That various accessory organs, proper to each sex, are found in a\r\n    rudimentary condition in the opposite sex, may be explained by\r\n    such organs having been gradually acquired by the one sex, and\r\n    then transmitted in a more or less imperfect state to the\r\n    other.(271)\r\n\r\n\r\nHe instances the case of “spurs, plumes, and brilliant colours, acquired\r\nfor battle or ornament by male birds” and only _partially_ inherited by\r\ntheir female descendants. In the problem to be dealt with, however, the\r\nneed of a more satisfactory explanation is evident, the facts being of so\r\nmuch more prominent and important a character than the mere superficial\r\ndetails with which they are compared by Darwin. Why not candidly admit the\r\nargument in favour of the hermaphroditism which characterizes the old\r\nfauna? Occultism proposes a solution which embraces the facts in a most\r\ncomprehensive and simple manner. These relics of a prior androgyne stock\r\nmust be placed in the same category as the pineal gland, and other organs\r\nequally mysterious, which afford us silent testimony as to the reality of\r\nfunctions which have long since become atrophied in the course of animal\r\nand human progress, but which once played a signal part in the general\r\neconomy of primeval life.\r\n\r\nThe Occult doctrine, in any case, can be advantageously compared with that\r\nof the most liberal men of Science, who have theorized upon the origin of\r\nthe first man.\r\n\r\nLong before Darwin, Naudin, who gave the name of Blastema to that which\r\nthe Darwinists call Protoplasm, put forward a theory half Occult and half\r\nscientifico‐materialistic. He made Adam, the A‐sexual, spring suddenly\r\nfrom the _clay_, as it is called in the _Bible_, the Blastema of Science.\r\nAs Naudin explains:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is from this larval form of mankind, that the evolutive force\r\n    effected the completion of species. For the accomplishment of this\r\n    great phenomenon, Adam had to pass through a phase of immobility\r\n    and unconsciousness, very analogous to the nymphal state of\r\n    animals undergoing metamorphosis.(272)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the eminent Botanist, Adam was not one man, however, but _mankind_,\r\nwhich remained\r\n\r\n\r\n    Concealed within a temporary organism, already distinct from all\r\n    others, and incapable of contracting an alliance with any of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe shows the differentiation of sexes accomplished by\r\n\r\n\r\n    A process of germination similar to that of medusæ and ascidians.\r\n\r\n\r\nMankind, thus constituted physiologically,\r\n\r\n\r\n    Would retain a sufficient evolutive force for the rapid production\r\n    of the various great human races.\r\n\r\n\r\nDe Quatrefages criticizes this position in _The Human Species_. It is\r\n_unscientific_, he says, or, properly speaking, Naudin’s ideas “do not\r\nform a scientific theory,” inasmuch as Primordial Blastema is connected in\r\nhis theory with the “_first cause_,” which is credited with having made\r\npotentially in the Blastema all past, present, and future beings, and thus\r\nof having in reality _created_ these beings _en masse_; moreover, Naudin\r\ndoes not even consider the “_second causes_,” or their action in this\r\nevolution of the organic world. Science, which is only occupied with\r\n“second causes,” has thus\r\n\r\n\r\n    Nothing to say to the theory of M. Naudin.(273)\r\n\r\n\r\nNor will it have any more to say to the Occult teachings, which are to\r\nsome extent approached by Naudin. For if we but see in his “Primordial\r\nBlastema” the Dhyân‐Chohanic Essence, the Chhâyâ or Double of the Pitris,\r\nwhich contains within itself the potentiality of all forms, we are quite\r\nin accord. But there are two real and vital differences between our\r\nteachings. M. Naudin declares that evolution has progressed by sudden\r\nleaps and bounds, instead of extending slowly over millions of years; and\r\nhis Primordial Blastema is endowed only with blind instincts—a kind of\r\n_unconscious_ First Cause in the Manifested Kosmos—which is an absurdity.\r\nWhereas it is our Dhyân‐Chohanic Essence—the _Causality_ of the Primal\r\nCause which creates _physical_ man—which is the living, active and\r\npotential Matter (pregnant _per se_ with that animal consciousness of a\r\nsuperior kind, such as is found in the ant and the beaver) which produces\r\nthe long series of physiological differentiations. Apart from this, his\r\n“ancient and general process of _creation_” from Proto‐organisms is as\r\nOccult as any theory of Paracelsus or Khunrath could be.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Kabalistic works are full of the proof of this. The _Zohar_,\r\nfor instance, says that every type in the visible has its prototype in the\r\ninvisible Universe.\r\n\r\n\r\n    All that which is in the Lower (our) World is found in the Upper.\r\n    The Lower and the Upper act and reäct upon each other.(274)\r\n\r\n\r\n20. THEIR FATHERS WERE THE SELF‐BORN. THE SELF‐BORN, THE CHHÂYÂ FROM THE\r\nBRILLIANT BODIES OF THE LORDS, THE FATHERS, THE SONS OF TWILIGHT.\r\n\r\nThe “Shadows,” or Chhâyâs, are called the Sons of the “Self‐born,” as the\r\nlatter name is applied to all the Gods and Beings, born through the Will,\r\nwhether of Deity or Adept. The Homunculi of Paracelsus would, perhaps, be\r\nalso given this name, though the latter process is on a far more material\r\nplane. The name “Sons of Twilight” shows that the “Self‐born” Progenitors\r\nof our Doctrine are identical with the Pitris of the Brâhmanical System,\r\nas the title is a reference to their mode of birth; these Pitris being\r\nstated to have issued from Brahmâ’s “Body of Twilight,” as stated in the\r\n_Purânas_.\r\n\r\n21. WHEN THE RACE BECAME OLD, THE OLD WATERS MIXED WITH THE FRESHER WATERS\r\n(_A_). WHEN ITS DROPS BECAME TURBID, THEY VANISHED AND DISAPPEARED IN THE\r\nNEW STREAM, IN THE HOT STREAM OF LIFE. THE OUTER OF THE FIRST BECAME THE\r\nINNER OF THE SECOND (_B_). THE OLD WING BECAME THE NEW SHADOW, AND THE\r\nSHADOW OF THE WING (_C_).\r\n\r\n(_a_) The old or Primitive Race merged in the Second Race, and became one\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\n(_b_) This is the mysterious process of the transformation and evolution\r\nof mankind. The material of the first Forms—shadowy, ethereal, and\r\nnegative—was drawn or absorbed into, and thus became the complement of the\r\nForms of the Second Race. The Commentary explains this by saying that, as\r\nthe First Race was simply composed of the Astral Shadows of the Creative\r\nProgenitors, having of course neither astral nor physical bodies of its\r\nown—the Race _never died_. Its “Men” melted gradually away, becoming\r\nabsorbed in the bodies of their own “Sweat‐born” progeny, more solid than\r\ntheir own. The old Form vanished and was absorbed by, disappeared in, the\r\nnew Form, more human and physical. There was no death in those days of a\r\nperiod more blissful than the Golden Age; but the first, or parent,\r\nmaterial was used for the formation of the new being, to form the Body and\r\neven the inner or _lower_ Principles or Bodies of the progeny.\r\n\r\n(_c_) When the “Shadow” retires, _i.e._, when the Astral Body becomes\r\ncovered with more solid flesh, man develops a Physical Body. The “Wing,”\r\nor the ethereal Form that produced its Shadow and Image, became the Shadow\r\nof the Astral Body and its own progeny. The expression is queer and\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\nAs there may be no occasion to refer to this mystery later, it is as well\r\nto point out at once the dual meaning contained in the Greek myth bearing\r\nupon this particular phase of evolution. It is found in the several\r\nvariants of the allegory of Leda and her two sons Castor and Pollux, each\r\nof which variants has a special meaning. Thus in Book XI of the _Odyssey_,\r\nLeda is spoken of as the spouse of Tyndarus, who gave birth by her husband\r\n“to two sons of valiant heart”—Castor and Pollux. Jupiter endows them with\r\na marvellous gift and privilege. They are semi‐immortal; they live and\r\ndie, each in turn, and every alternate day (ἑτερήμεροι(275)). As the\r\nTyndaridæ, the twin brothers are an astronomical symbol, and stand for Day\r\nand Night; their two wives, Phœbe and Hilaeira, the daughters of Apollo or\r\nthe Sun, personifying the Dawn and the Twilight.(276) Again, in the\r\nallegory where Zeus is shown as the father of the two heroes—born from the\r\nEgg to which Leda gives birth—the myth is entirely theogonical. It relates\r\nto that group of cosmic allegories in which the world is described as born\r\nfrom an Egg. For Leda assumes in it the shape of a white swan, when\r\nuniting herself to the Divine Swan or Brahma‐Kalahamsa. Leda is the\r\nmythical Bird, then, to which, in the traditions of various peoples of the\r\nÂryan race, are attributed various ornithological forms of birds which all\r\nlay golden Eggs.(277) In the _Kalevala_, the Epic Poem of Finland, the\r\nbeauteous daughter of the Ether, the “Water‐Mother,” creates the World in\r\nconjunction with a “Duck”—another form of the Swan or Goose, Kalahamsa—who\r\nlays six golden eggs, and the seventh, an “egg of iron,” in her lap. But\r\nthe variant of the Leda allegory which has a direct reference to mystic\r\nman is found in Pindar(278) only, with a slighter reference to it in the\r\nHomeric Hymns.(279) Castor and Pollux are in it no longer the Dioscuri of\r\nApollodorus(280); but become the highly significant symbol of the dual\r\nman, the Mortal and the Immortal. Not only this, but as will now be seen,\r\nthey are also the symbol of the Third Race, and its transformation from\r\nthe Animal‐man into a God‐man with only an animal body.\r\n\r\nPindar shows Leda uniting herself in the same night to her husband and\r\nalso to the Father of the Gods—Zeus. Thus Castor is the son of the Mortal,\r\nPollux the progeny of the Immortal. In the allegory made up for the\r\noccasion, it is said that in a riot of vengeance against the\r\nApharides,(281) Pollux kills Lynceus—“of all mortals he whose sight is the\r\nmost penetrating”—but Castor is wounded by Idas, “he who sees and knows.”\r\nZeus puts an end to the fight by hurling his thunderbolt and killing the\r\nlast two combatants. Pollux finds his brother dying.(282) In his despair\r\nhe calls upon Zeus to slay him also. “Thou canst not die altogether,”\r\nanswers the master of the Gods; “thou art of a divine race.” But he gives\r\nhim the choice: Pollux will either remain immortal, living eternally in\r\nOlympus; or, if he would share his brother’s fate in all things, he must\r\npass half his existence underground, and the other half in the golden\r\nheavenly abodes. This semi‐immortality, which is also to be shared by\r\nCastor, is accepted by Pollux.(283) _And thus the twin brothers live\r\nalternately, one during the day, and the other during the night._(284)\r\n\r\nIs this a poetical fiction only? An allegory, one of those “solar myth”\r\ninterpretations, higher than which no modern Orientalist seems able to\r\nsoar? Indeed, it is much more. Here we have an allusion to the “Egg‐born”\r\nThird Race; the first half of which is mortal, _i.e._, unconscious in its\r\nPersonality, and having nothing within itself to survive;(285) and the\r\nlatter half of which becomes immortal in its Individuality, by reason of\r\nits Fifth Principle being called to life by the _Informing Gods_, and thus\r\nconnecting the Monad with this Earth. This is Pollux; while Castor\r\nrepresents the _personal_, mortal man, an animal of not even a superior\r\nkind, when unlinked from the divine _Individuality_. “Twins” truly; yet\r\ndivorced by death for ever, unless Pollux, moved by the voice of twinship,\r\nbestows on his less favoured mortal brother a share of his own divine\r\nnature, thus associating him with his own immortality.\r\n\r\nSuch is the Occult meaning of the metaphysical aspect of the allegory. The\r\nwidely spread modern interpretation of it—so celebrated in antiquity,\r\nPlutarch tells us,(286) as symbolical of brotherly devotion—namely, that\r\nit was an image of the Sun and Moon borrowed from the spectacle of Nature,\r\nis weak and inadequate to explain the secret meaning. Besides the fact\r\nthat the Moon, with the Greeks, was feminine in exoteric mythology, and\r\ncould therefore hardly be regarded as Castor, and at the same time be\r\nidentified with Diana, ancient Symbologists who held the Sun, the king of\r\nall sidereal orbs, as the visible image of the highest Deity, would not\r\nhave personified it by Pollux, a demi‐god only.(287)\r\n\r\nIf from Greek mythology we pass to the Mosaic allegories and symbolism, we\r\nshall find a still more striking corroboration of the same tenet under\r\nanother form. Unable to trace in them the “Egg‐born,” we shall still\r\nunmistakably find in the first four chapters of _Genesis_ the Androgynes\r\nand the first Three Races of the Secret Doctrine, hidden under most\r\ningenious symbology.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Divine Hermaphrodite.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn impenetrable veil of secrecy was thrown over the Occult and Religious\r\nMysteries, after the submersion of the last remnant of the Atlantean Race,\r\nsome 12,000 years ago, lest they should be shared by the unworthy, and so\r\ndesecrated. Of these Sciences several have now become exoteric—such as\r\nAstronomy, for instance, in its purely mathematical and physical aspects.\r\nBut their dogmas and tenets, being all symbolized and left to the sole\r\nguardianship of parable and allegory, have been forgotten, and hence the\r\nmeaning has become perverted. Nevertheless, one finds the Hermaphrodite in\r\nthe scriptures and traditions of almost every nation; and why such\r\nunanimous agreement if the statement is only a fiction?\r\n\r\nUnder cover of this secrecy the Fifth Race were led to the establishment,\r\nor rather the reëstablishment of the Religious Mysteries, in which ancient\r\ntruths might be taught to the coming generations under the veil of\r\nallegory and symbolism. Behold the imperishable witness to the evolution\r\nof the Human Races from the Divine, and especially from the Androgynous\r\nRace—the Egyptian Sphinx, that riddle of the Ages! Divine Wisdom\r\nincarnating on Earth, and forced to taste of the bitter fruit of personal\r\nexperience of pain and suffering, generated on Earth only under the shade\r\nof the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil—a secret first known only to\r\nthe Elohim, the Self‐Initiated, “Higher Gods.”(288)\r\n\r\nIn the _Book of Enoch_ we have Adam,(289) the first Divine Androgyne,\r\nseparating into man and woman, and becoming Jah‐Heva in one form, or Race,\r\nand Cain and Abel(290)—male and female—in its other form or Race—the\r\ndouble‐sexed Jehovah,(291) an echo of its Âryan prototype, Brahmâ‐Vâch.\r\nAfter which come the Third and Fourth Root‐Races of mankind(292)—that is\r\nto say, Races of men and women, or individuals of opposite sexes, no\r\nlonger sexless Semi‐spirits and Androgynes, as were the two Races which\r\nprecede them. This fact is hinted at in every Anthropogony. It is found in\r\nfable and allegory, in myth and revealed Scriptures, in legend and\r\ntradition. For, of all the great Mysteries, inherited by Initiates from\r\nhoary antiquity, this is _one of the greatest_. It accounts for the bi‐\r\nsexual element found in every Creative Deity, in Brahmâ‐Virâj‐Vâch, as in\r\nAdam‐Jehovah‐Eve, also in Cain‐Jehovah‐Abel. For “The Book of the\r\nGenerations of Adam” does not even mention Cain and Abel, but says only:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Male and female created he them; ... and called their name\r\n    Adam.(293)\r\n\r\n\r\nThen it proceeds to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n    And Adam ... begat a son in _his own likeness_, after his image;\r\n    and called his name Seth.(294)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter which he begets other sons and daughters, thus proving that Cain and\r\nAbel are his own allegorical permutations. Adam stands for the primitive\r\n_Human_ Race, especially in its cosmo‐sidereal sense. Not so, however, in\r\nits theo‐anthropological meaning. The compound name of Jehovah, or Jah‐\r\nHovah, meaning _male life_ and _female life_—first androgynous, then\r\nseparated into sexes—is used in this sense in _Genesis_ from Chapter V\r\nonwards. As the author of the _Source of Measures_ says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The two words of which _Jehovah_ is composed make up the original\r\n    idea of male‐female, as the birth originator.(295)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the Hebrew letter _Jod_ was the _membrum virile_ and _Hovah_ was Eve,\r\nthe mother of all living, or the procreatrix, Earth and Nature. The author\r\nbelieves, therefore, that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is seen that the _perfect one_ [the perfect female circle or\r\n    Yoni, 20612, numerically], as _originator of measures_, takes also\r\n    the form of _birth_ origin, as _hermaphrodite one_; hence the\r\n    phallic form and use.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrecisely; only “the phallic form and use” came long ages later; and the\r\nfirst and original meaning of Enos, the son of Seth, was the first Race\r\nborn in the present usual way from man and woman—for Seth is no man, but a\r\n_race_. Before him humanity was hermaphrodite. While Seth is the first\r\nresult (physiologically) after the “Fall,” he is also the first _man_;\r\nhence his son Enos is referred to as the “Son of _Man_.” Seth represents\r\nthe _later_ Third Race.\r\n\r\nTo screen the real mystery name of Ain Suph—the Boundless and Endless No‐\r\nThing—the Kabalists have brought forward the compound attribute‐\r\nappellation of one of the personal Creative Elohim, whose name was Yah or\r\nJah—the letters _i_ or _j_ or _y_ being interchangeable—or Jah‐Hovah,\r\n_i.e._, _male_ and _female_;(296) Jah‐Eve a hermaphrodite, or the _first\r\nform of humanity_, the original Adam of Earth, not even Adam Kadmon, whose\r\n“Mind‐born Son” is the earthly Jah‐Hovah, mystically. And knowing this,\r\nthe crafty Rabbin‐Kabalist has made of it a name so _secret_, that he\r\ncould not divulge it later on without exposing the whole scheme; and thus\r\nhe was obliged to make it _sacred_.\r\n\r\nHow close is the identity between Brahmâ‐Prajâpati and Jehovah‐Sephiroth,\r\nbetween Brahmâ‐Virâj and Jehovah‐Adam, the _Bible_ and the _Purânas_\r\ncompared alone can show. Analyzed, and read in the same light, they afford\r\ncogent evidence that they are two copies of the same original—made at two\r\nperiods far distant from each other. Compare once more in relation to this\r\nsubject _Genesis_ iv. 1 and 26 and _Manu_ i. 32 and they will both yield\r\ntheir meaning. In Manu, Brahmâ, who, like Jehovah or Adam in _Genesis_, is\r\nboth man and God, and divides his body into male and female, stands, in\r\nhis Esoteric meaning, for the symbolical personification of creative and\r\n_generative_ power, both divine and human. The _Zohar_ affords still more\r\nconvincing proof of identity, while some Rabbins repeat word for word\r\ncertain original Paurânic expressions; _e.g._, the “creation” of the world\r\nis generally considered in the Brâhmanical books to be the Lîlâ, the\r\ndelight or sport, the amusement of the Supreme Creator.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Vishnu, being thus discrete and indiscrete substance, spirit, and\r\n    time, sports like a playful boy, as you shall learn by listening\r\n    to his frolics.(297)\r\n\r\n\r\nNow compare this with what is said in the Book, _Nobeleth ’Hokhmah_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Qabbalists say, that the entering into existence of the worlds\r\n    happened through delight, in that Ain Suph [? !] rejoiced in\r\n    Itself, and flashed and beamed from Itself to Itself ... which are\r\n    all called delight.(298)\r\n\r\n\r\nThus it is not a “curious idea of the Qabbalists,” as the author just\r\nquoted remarks, but a purely Paurânic, Âryan idea. Only, why make of Ain\r\nSuph a Creator?\r\n\r\nThe “Divine Hermaphrodite” is, then, Brahmâ‐Vâch‐Virâj; and that of the\r\nSemites, or rather of the Jews, is Jehovah‐Cain‐Abel. Only the “Heathen”\r\nwere, and are, more sincere and frank than were the later Israëlites and\r\nRabbis, who undeniably knew the real meaning of their exoteric deity. The\r\nJews regard the name given to them—the Yah‐oudi—as an insult. Yet they\r\nhave, or would have if they only wished it, as undeniable a right to call\r\nthemselves the ancient Yah‐oudi, “Jah‐hovians,” as the Brâhmans have to\r\ncall themselves Brâhmans _after their national deity_. For Jah‐hovah is\r\nthe generic name of that Group or Hierarchy of Creative Planetary Angels,\r\nunder whose Star their nation has evolved. He is one of the Planetary\r\nElohim of the Regent Group of Saturn. Verse 26 of Chapter iv of _Genesis_,\r\nwhen read correctly, would alone give them such a right, for it calls the\r\nnew Race of men—sprung from Seth and Enos—_Jehovah_, something quite\r\ndifferent from the translation adopted in the _Bible_, which ought to\r\nread:\r\n\r\n\r\n    To him also, was born a son, Enos; then began men to call\r\n    themselves Jah, or Yah‐hovah,\r\n\r\n\r\nto wit, _men and women_, the “Lords of Creation.” One has but to read the\r\nabove‐mentioned verse in the original Hebrew text and by the light of the\r\nKabalah, to find that, instead of the words as they now stand translated,\r\nthe correct translation should be:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Then began men to _call themselves_ Jehovah;\r\n\r\n\r\nand not:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Then began men to call upon the name of the Lord\r\n\r\n\r\nthe latter being a mistranslation, whether deliberate or not. Again the\r\nwell‐known passage:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I have gotten a man from the Lord,\r\n\r\n\r\nshould read:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I have gotten a man, even Jehovah.(299)\r\n\r\n\r\nLuther translated the passage one way, the Roman Catholics quite\r\ndifferently. Bishop Wordsworth renders it:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Cain—_I have gotten—Kain_, from _Kâ’nithi, I have gotten_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLuther:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I have gotten a man—even the Lord [Jehovah].\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the author of _The Source of Measures_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I have _measured a man_, even _Jehovah_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last is the correct rendering for—(_a_) a famous Rabbin, a Kabalist,\r\nexplained the passage to the writer in precisely this way, and (_b_) this\r\nrendering is identical with that in the Secret Doctrine of the East with\r\nregard to Brahmâ.\r\n\r\nIn _Isis Unveiled_,(300) it was explained by the writer that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Cain ... is the son of the “Lord” not of Adam.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “Lord” is Adam Kadmon, the “Father” of Yod‐Heva, “Adam‐Eve,” or\r\nJehovah, the son of sinful thought, not the progeny of flesh and blood.\r\nSeth, on the other hand, is the _leader and the progenitor of the Races of\r\nthe Earth_; for he is the son of Adam, exoterically, but Esoterically he\r\nis the progeny of Cain and Abel, since Abel or Hebel is a female, the\r\ncounterpart and female half of the male Cain, and Adam is the collective\r\nname for man and woman:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Male and female (_zachar va nakobeh_) created he them ... and\r\n    called _their_ name Adam.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe verses in _Genesis_ from Chapters i to v, are purposely mixed up for\r\nKabalistic reasons. After the “Man” of _Genesis_ i. 26, and Enos, the Son\r\nof Man, of iv. 26; after Adam, the first Androgyne; after Adam Kadmon—the\r\nsexless (the first) Logos—Adam and Eve once separated, come finally\r\nJehovah‐Eve and Cain‐Jehovah. These represent distinct Root‐Races, for\r\nmillions of years elapsed between them.\r\n\r\nHence the Âryan and the Semitic Theo‐anthropographies are two leaves on\r\nthe same stem; their respective personifications and symbolic personages\r\nstanding in relation to each other in the following way:\r\n\r\nI. The “Unknowable” referred to in various ways in Rig Vedic verse, such\r\nas “_Nought_ was,” called, later on, Parabrahman—the אין, Ain, No‐thing,\r\nor Ain Suph of the Kabalists—and again, the “Spirit” (of God) that moves\r\nupon the face of the Waters, in _Genesis_. All these are _identical_.\r\nMoreover, in _Genesis_ i, verse 2 is placed as verse 1 in the _secret_\r\nKabalistic texts, where it is followed by the Elohim “creating the Heaven\r\nand the Earth.” This deliberate shifting of the order of the verses was\r\nnecessary for _monotheistic_ and Kabalistic purposes. Jeremiah’s curse\r\nagainst those Elohim (Gods) who _have not created_ the Heavens and the\r\nEarth,(301) shows that there were other Elohim who had.\r\n\r\nII. The Heavenly Manu‐Svâyambhuva, who sprang from Svayambhû‐Nârâyana, the\r\n“Self‐existent,” the Adam Kadmon of the Kabalists, and the Androgyne\r\n“Man,” of _Genesis_ i, are also identical.\r\n\r\nIII. Manu‐Svâyambhuva is Brahmâ, or the Logos; and he is Adam Kadmon, who\r\nin _Genesis_, iv. 5, separates himself into two halves, male and female,\r\nthus becoming Jah‐Hovah or Jehovah‐Eve; as Manu‐Svâyambhuva, or Brahmâ,\r\nseparates himself to become “Brahmâ‐Virâj and Vâch‐Virâj,” male and\r\nfemale. All the rest of the texts and versions are “blinds.”\r\n\r\nIV. Vâch is the daughter of Brahmâ and is named Shata‐Rûpâ, “the hundred‐\r\nformed,” and Sâvitrî, Generatrix, the Mother of the Gods and of all\r\nliving. She is identical with Eve, “the Mother [of all the Lords or Gods\r\nor] of all living.” Besides this there are many other Occult meanings.\r\n\r\nWhat is written on the subject in _Isis Unveiled_, although scattered\r\nabout and very cautiously expressed at the time, is correct.\r\n\r\nExplaining Esoterically Ezekiel’s Wheel, it is said of Jodhevah or\r\nJehovah:\r\n\r\n\r\n    When the Ternary is taken in the beginning of the Tetragram, it\r\n    expresses the Divine Creation _spiritually_, _i.e._, without any\r\n    carnal sin: taken at its opposite end it expresses the latter; it\r\n    is feminine. The name of Eve is composed of three letters, that of\r\n    the primitive or heavenly Adam, is written with one letter, Jod or\r\n    Yod; therefore it must not be read Jehovah but Ieva, or Eve. The\r\n    Adam of the first chapter is the spiritual, therefore pure\r\n    androgyne, Adam Kadmon. When woman issues from the left rib of the\r\n    second Adam (of dust), the pure Virgo is separated, and falling\r\n    into “generation,” or the downward cycle, becomes Scorpio, emblem\r\n    of sin and matter. While the ascending cycle points to the purely\r\n    Spiritual Races, or the ten Prediluvian Patriarchs, the Prajâpatis\r\n    and Sephiroth, led on by the creative Deity itself, who is Adam\r\n    Kadmon or Yodcheva, [spiritually,] the lower one [Jehovah] is that\r\n    of the Terrestrial Races, led on by Enoch or Libra, the seventh;\r\n    who, because he is half‐divine, half‐terrestrial, is said to have\r\n    been taken by God alive. Enoch, or Hermes, or Libra, are one.(302)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is only one of the several meanings. No need to remind the scholar\r\nthat Scorpio is the astrological sign of the organs of reproduction. Like\r\nthe Indian Rishis, the Patriarchs are all convertible in their numbers, as\r\nwell as interchangeable. According to the subject to which they relate\r\nthey become ten, twelve, seven or five, and even _fourteen_, and they have\r\nthe same Esoteric meaning as the Manus or Rishis.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Jehovah, as may be shown, has a variety of etymologies, but only\r\nthose are _true_ which are found in the Kabalah. יהוה (Ieve) is the _Old\r\nTestament_ term, and was pronounced Ya‐va. Inman suggests that it is\r\ncontracted from the two words יהו יה, Yaho‐Iah, Jaho‐Jah, or Jaho is Jah.\r\nPunctuated it is יְהוֶֹה, which is, however, a Rabbinical caprice to\r\nassociate it with the name Adoni, or אֲדנָי, which has the same points. It\r\nis curious, and indeed hardly conceivable, that the Jews anciently read\r\nthe name יהוה Adoni, when they had so many names of which Jeho, and Jah,\r\nand Iah, constituted a part. But so it was; and Philo Byblus, who gives us\r\nthe so‐called fragment of Sanchuniathon, spelt it in Greek letters Ιευω,\r\nJavo or Jevo. Theodoret says that the Samaritans pronounced it Yahva, and\r\nthe Jews Yaho. Prof. Gibbs, however, suggests its punctuation thus:\r\nיֵהִוֶה (Ye‐hou‐vih); and he cut the Gordian knot of its true Occult\r\nmeaning. For in this last form, as a Hebrew verb, it means “he\r\nwill—be.”(303) It was also derived from the Chaldaic verb הֲוָא, or הִוָה,\r\neue (eve), or eua (eva), “to be.” And so it was, since from Enosh, the\r\n“Son of Man,” only, were the truly human Races to begin and “to be,” as\r\nmales and females. This statement receives further corroboration, inasmuch\r\nas Parkhurst makes the verb הוה to mean, (1) “to fall down” (_i.e._ into\r\ngeneration or Matter); and (2) “to be, to continue”—as a _race_. The\r\naspirate of the word eua (Eva), “to be,” being הוה, Heve (Eve), which is\r\nthe feminine of יהוה, and the same as Hebe, the Grecian Goddess of youth\r\nand the Olympian bride of Heracles, makes the name Jehovah appear still\r\nmore clearly in its primitive double‐sexed form.\r\n\r\nFinding in Sanskrit such syllables as Jah and Yah, _e.g._, Jâh‐navî,\r\n“Ganges,” and Jagan‐nâtha, “Lord of the World,” it becomes clear why Mr.\r\nRawlinson is so very confident in his works of an Âryan or Vedic influence\r\non the early mythology of Babylon. Nor is it to be much wondered at that\r\nthe alleged ten tribes of Israel disappeared during the captivity period,\r\nwithout leaving a trace behind them, when we are informed that the Jews\r\nhad _de facto_ but two tribes—those of Judah and of Levi. The Levites,\r\nmoreover, were not a tribe at all, but a priestly caste. The descendants\r\nhave only followed their progenitors, the various patriarchs, into thin,\r\nsidereal air. There were _Brahms_ and _A‐brahms_, in days of old, truly,\r\nand before the first Jew had been born. Every nation held its first God\r\nand Gods to be androgynous; nor could it be otherwise, since they regarded\r\ntheir distant primeval progenitors, their dual‐sexed ancestors, as divine\r\nBeings and Gods, just as do the Chinese to this day. And they were divine\r\nin one sense, as also was their first human progeny, the “mind‐born”\r\nprimitive humanity, which was most assuredly bi‐sexual, as all the more\r\nancient symbols and traditions show.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Under the emblematical devices and peculiar phraseology of the\r\n    priesthood of old, lie latent hints of sciences as yet\r\n    undiscovered during the present cycle. Well acquainted as may be a\r\n    scholar with the hieratic writing and hieroglyphical system of the\r\n    Egyptians, he must first of all learn to sift their records. He\r\n    has to assure himself, compasses and rule in hand, that the\r\n    picture‐writing he is examining fits, to a line, _certain fixed\r\n    geometrical figures_ which are the hidden keys to such records,\r\n    before he ventures on an interpretation.\r\n\r\n    But there are myths which speak for themselves. In this class we\r\n    may include the double‐sexed first creators of every Cosmogony.\r\n    The Greek Zeus‐Zên (Æther), and Chthonia (the Chaotic Earth) and\r\n    Metis (Water), his wives; Osiris and Isis‐Latona—the former God\r\n    also representing Æther, the first emanation of the Supreme Deity,\r\n    Amun, the primeval source of Light; the Goddess Earth and Water\r\n    again; Mithras, the rock‐born God, the symbol of the male Mundane\r\n    Fire, or the personified Primordial Light, and Mithra, the Fire‐\r\n    Goddess, at once his mother and his wife; the pure element of Fire\r\n    (the active, or male principle) regarded as light and heat, in\r\n    conjunction with Earth and Water, or Matter (the female or passive\r\n    element of cosmical generation).(304)\r\n\r\n\r\nAll these are records of the primeval divine Hermaphrodite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStanza VI. The Evolution Of The “Sweat‐Born.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    22. The evolution of the three Races continued. 23. The Second\r\n    Race creates the Third and perishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n22. THEN THE SECOND EVOLVED THE EGG‐BORN, THE THIRD.(305) THE SWEAT GREW,\r\nITS DROPS GREW, AND THE DROPS BECAME HARD AND ROUND. THE SUN WARMED IT;\r\nTHE MOON COOLED AND SHAPED IT; THE WIND FED IT UNTIL ITS RIPENESS. THE\r\nWHITE SWAN FROM THE STARRY VAULT(306) OVERSHADOWED THE BIG DROP. THE EGG\r\nOF THE FUTURE RACE, THE MAN‐SWAN(307) OF THE LATER THIRD (_A_). FIRST\r\nMALE‐FEMALE, THEN MAN AND WOMAN (_B_).\r\n\r\n(_a_) The text of the Stanza clearly implies that the human embryo was\r\nnourished _ab extra_ by Cosmic Forces, and that the “Father‐Mother”\r\nfurnished apparently the germ that ripened; in all probability a “sweat‐\r\nborn egg,” to be hatched out, in some mysterious way, disconnected from\r\nthe “double” parent. It is comparatively easy to conceive of an oviparous\r\nhumanity, since even now man is, in one sense, “egg‐born.” Magendie,\r\nmoreover, in his _Precis Élémentaire de Physiologie_, citing\r\n\r\n\r\n    A case where the umbilical cord was ruptured and perfectly\r\n    cicatrized,\r\n\r\n\r\nyet the infant was born alive, pertinently asks:\r\n\r\n\r\n    How was the circulation carried on in this organ?\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the next page he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Nothing is at present known respecting the use of digestion in the\r\n    fœtus.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd respecting its nutrition, he propounds this query:\r\n\r\n\r\n    What, then, can we say of the nutrition of the fœtus?\r\n    Physiological works contain only _vague conjectures_ on this\r\n    point.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Ah, but,” the sceptic may urge, “Magendie’s book belongs to the last\r\ngeneration, and Science has since made such strides that his stigma of\r\nignorance can no longer be fixed upon the profession.” Indeed; then let us\r\nturn to a very great authority upon Physiology, viz., Sir Michael Foster,\r\nand, to the disadvantage of Modern Science, we shall find him saying:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Concerning the rise and development of the functional activities\r\n    of the embryo, our knowledge is almost a blank. We know scarcely\r\n    anything about the various steps by which the primary fundamental\r\n    qualities of the protoplasm of the ovum are differentiated into\r\n    the complex phenomena which we have attempted in this book to\r\n    explain.(308)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe students of Trin. Coll. Cantab, will now kindly draw a veil before the\r\nstatue of Hygieia and bandage the eyes of the busts of Galen and\r\nHippocrates, lest they look reproachfully at their degenerate descendants.\r\nOne further fact we must note. Sir Michael Foster is discreetly silent\r\nabout the case of the ruptured umbilical cord cited by his great French\r\n_confrère_.\r\n\r\n(_b_) This is a very curious statement as explained in the Commentaries.\r\nTo make it clear: The First Race having created the Second by “budding,”\r\nas explained above, the Second Race gives birth to the Third—which itself\r\nis separated into three distinct divisions, consisting of men differently\r\nprocreated. The first two of these are produced by an oviparous method,\r\npresumably unknown to modern Natural History. While the early sub‐races of\r\nthe Third Humanity procreated their species by a kind of exudation of\r\nmoisture or vital fluid, the drops of which coalescing formed an oviform\r\nball—or shall we say egg—that served as an extraneous vehicle for the\r\ngeneration therein of a fœtus and child, the mode of procreation by the\r\nlater sub‐races changed, in its results at all events. The little ones of\r\nthe earlier sub‐races were entirely sexless—shapeless even for all one\r\nknows;(309) but those of the later sub‐races were born androgynous. It is\r\nin the Third Race that the separation of sexes occurred. From being\r\npreviously a‐sexual, Humanity became distinctly hermaphrodite or bi‐\r\nsexual; and finally the man‐bearing Eggs began to give birth, gradually\r\nand almost imperceptibly in their evolutionary development, first, to\r\nbeings in which one sex predominated over the other, and, finally, to\r\ndistinct men and women. And now let us search for corroboration of these\r\nstatements in the religious legends of East and West. Let us take the\r\n“Egg‐born Race” first. Think of Kashyapa, the Vedic sage, and the most\r\nprolific of creators. He was the son of Marichi, Brahmâ’s Mind‐born Son;\r\nand he is made to become the father of the Nâgas, or Serpents, among other\r\nbeings. Exoterically, the Nâgas are semi‐divine beings which have a human\r\nface and the tail of a serpent. Yet there was a race of Nâgas, said to be\r\na thousand in number only, born or rather sprung from Kadrû, Kashyapa’s\r\nwife, for _the purpose of peopling Pâtâla_, which is undeniably America,\r\nas will be shown; and there was a Nâga‐Dvîpa, one of the seven divisions\r\nof Bhâratavarsha, India, inhabited by a people bearing the same name, who\r\nare allowed, even by some Orientalists, to be _historical_, and to have\r\nleft many a trace behind them to this day.\r\n\r\nNow the point most insisted upon at present is that, whatever origin be\r\nclaimed for man, his evolution took place in this order: (1) sexless, as\r\nall the earlier forms are; (2) then, by a natural transition, he became a\r\n“solitary hermaphrodite,” a bi‐sexual being; and (3) finally separated and\r\nbecame what he is now. Science teaches us that all the primitive forms,\r\nthough sexless, “still retained the power of undergoing the processes of\r\na‐sexual multiplication”; why, then, should man be excluded from that law\r\nof Nature? Bi‐sexual reproduction is an evolution, a specialized and\r\nperfected form on the scale of Matter of the fissiparous act of\r\nreproduction. Occult teachings are preëminently panspermic, and the early\r\nhistory of humanity is hidden only “from ordinary mortals”; nor is the\r\nhistory of the primitive Races buried for the Initiates in the tomb of\r\ntime, as it is for profane Science. Therefore, supported on the one hand\r\nby that Science which shows us progressive development and an internal\r\ncause for every external modification, as a law in Nature; and, on the\r\nother hand, by an implicit faith in the Wisdom—we may say Pansophia\r\neven—of the universal traditions gathered and preserved by the Initiates,\r\nwho have perfected them into an almost faultless system—thus supported, we\r\nventure to state the doctrine clearly.\r\n\r\nIn an able article, written some fifteen years ago, our learned and\r\nrespected friend Prof. Alexander Wilder, of New York, shows the absolute\r\nlogic and necessity of believing “The Primeval Race Double‐Sexed,” and\r\ngives a number of scientific reasons for it.(310) He argues firstly, that\r\na large part of the vegetable creation exhibits the phenomenon of bi‐\r\nsexuality, the Linnæan classification enumerating thus almost all plants.\r\nThis is the case in the superior families of the vegetable kingdoms as\r\nmuch as in the lower forms, from the hemp to the Lombardy poplar and\r\nailanthus. In the animal kingdom also it is the same. In insect life, the\r\nmoth generates a worm, and the worm becomes a moth, as in the Mysteries\r\nthe great secret was expressed—_Taurus __ Taurus Draconem genuit, et\r\nTaurum Draco_. The coral‐producing family, which, according to Agassiz,\r\nhas spent many hundreds of thousands of years, during the present\r\ngeological period, in building out the peninsula of Florida, produce their\r\noffspring from themselves like the buds and ramifications in a tree. Bees\r\nare somewhat in the same line. The aphides, or plant lice, keep house like\r\nAmazons, and _virgin parents_ perpetuate the race for ten successive\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nWhat say the old Sages, the Philosopher‐teachers of antiquity?\r\nAristophanes speaks thus on the subject in Plato’s _Banquet_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Our nature of old was not the same as it is now. It was\r\n    _androgynous_; the form and name partaking of, and being common to\r\n    both the male and female.... Their bodies ... were round, and the\r\n    manner of their running circular.(311) They were terrible in force\r\n    and strength and had prodigious ambition. Hence Zeus divided each\r\n    of them into two, making them weaker; Apollo, under his direction,\r\n    closed up the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeshia and Meshiane were but a single individual with the old Persians.\r\n\r\n\r\n    They also taught that man was the product of the Tree of Life,\r\n    growing in androgynous pairs, till they were separated at a\r\n    subsequent modification of the human form.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Book of the Generations (_Toleduth_) of Adam, the verse:\r\n\r\n\r\n    God created (_bara_, brought forth) man in his image, in the image\r\n    of God created he him, male and female created he them,\r\n\r\n\r\n—if read Esoterically will yield the true sense, viz.:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Elohim [Gods] brought forth from themselves [by modification]\r\n    man in their image ... created they _him_ [collective Humanity, or\r\n    Adam], male and female created _he_ [collective Deity] them.(312)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis will show the Esoteric point. The _Sexless_ Race was their first\r\nproduction, a modification _of_ and _from_ themselves, the pure Spiritual\r\nExistences; and this was Adam _solus_. Thence came the _Second_ Race:\r\nAdam‐Eve, or Jod‐Heva, inactive Androgynes; and finally the _Third_, or\r\nthe “_Separating_ Hermaphrodite,” Cain and Abel, who produce the Fourth,\r\nSeth‐Enos, etc. It is this Third, the last semi‐spiritual Race, which was\r\nalso the last vehicle of the divine and innate Wisdom, ingenerate in the\r\nEnochs, the Seers of that Mankind. The _Fourth_, which had tasted of the\r\nfruit of the Tree of Good and Evil—Wisdom already united to earthy, and\r\ntherefore _impure_, intelligence(313)—had consequently to acquire that\r\nWisdom by initiation and great struggle. And the union of Wisdom and\r\nIntelligence, the former _ruling_ the latter, is called in the Hermetic\r\nbooks “the God possessing the double fecundity of the two sexes.”\r\n\r\nMystically Jesus was held to be man‐woman. So also in the Orphic Hymns,\r\nsung during the Mysteries, we find: “Zeus is a male, Zeus is an immortal\r\nmaid.” The Egyptian Ammon was the Goddess Neïth, in his other half.\r\nJupiter has female breasts, Venus is bearded in some of her statues, and\r\nIlâ, the Goddess, is also Su‐dyumna, the God, as Vaivasvata’s progeny.\r\n\r\nSays Professor Wilder:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The name _Adam_, or man, itself implies this double form of\r\n    existence. It is identical with _Athamas_, or _Thomas_ (Tamil,\r\n    _Tam_), which is rendered by the Greek _Didumos_, a twin; if,\r\n    therefore, the first woman was formed subsequently to the first\r\n    man, she must, as a logical necessity, be “taken out of man.”\r\n    Accordingly we read: “And the _side_ which the Lord God [Elohim]\r\n    had taken from man, made he a woman.” The Hebrew word here used is\r\n    _Tzala_, which bears the translation we have given. It is easy to\r\n    trace the legend in Berosus, who says that _Thalatth_ (the\r\n    _Omorôka_, or Lady of Urka) was the beginning of creation. She was\r\n    also Telita [? Melita], the queen of the Moon....\r\n\r\n    The two memorable twin‐births of _Genesis_, that of Cain and Abel,\r\n    and of Esau and Jacob, shadow the same idea. The name _Hebel_ is\r\n    the same as Eve, and its characteristic seems to be feminine.\r\n    “Unto thee shall be his desire,” said the Lord God to Cain; “and\r\n    thou shalt rule over him.” The same language had been uttered to\r\n    Eve: “Thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over\r\n    thee.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThus the pristine bi‐sexual unity of the human Third Root‐Race is an axiom\r\nin the Secret Doctrine. Its virgin individuals were raised to “Gods,”\r\nbecause that Race represented their “Divine Dynasty.” The moderns are\r\nsatisfied with worshipping the male heroes of the Fourth Race, who created\r\nGods after their own sexual image, whereas the Gods of primeval mankind\r\nwere “male _and_ female.”\r\n\r\nAs stated in Volume I, the Humanities developed coördinately, and on\r\nparallel lines with the four Elements, every new Race being\r\nphysiologically adapted to meet the additional Element. Our Fifth Race is\r\nrapidly approaching the Fifth Element—call it interstellar ether, if you\r\nwill—which has more to do, however, with psychology than with physics. We\r\nmen have learned to live in every climate, whether frigid or tropical, but\r\nthe first two Races had nought to do with climate, nor were they\r\nsubservient to any temperature or change therein. And thus, we are taught,\r\nmen lived down to the close of the Third Root‐Race, when eternal spring\r\nreigned over the whole Globe, such as is now enjoyed by the inhabitants of\r\nJupiter; a world, which, as M. Camille Flammarion says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Is not subject like our own to the vicissitudes of seasons nor to\r\n    abrupt alternations of temperature, but is enriched with all the\r\n    treasures of eternal spring.(314)\r\n\r\n\r\nThose Astronomers who maintain that Jupiter is in a molten condition, in\r\nour sense of the term, are invited to settle their dispute with this\r\nlearned French Astronomer.(315) It must, however, be always borne in mind\r\nthat the “eternal spring” referred to is only a condition _cognized as\r\nsuch by the Jovians_. It is not “spring,” _as we know it_. In this\r\nreservation is to be found the reconciliation between the two theories\r\nhere cited. Both embrace _partial_ truths.\r\n\r\nIt is thus a universal tradition that mankind has evolved gradually into\r\nits present shape from an almost transparent condition of texture, and\r\nneither by miracle nor by sexual intercourse. Moreover, this is in full\r\naccord with the ancient Philosophies; from those of Egypt and India, with\r\ntheir Divine Dynasties, down to that of Plato. And all these universal\r\nbeliefs must be classed with the “presentiments” and “obstinate\r\nconceptions,” some of them ineradicable, in popular faiths. Such beliefs,\r\nas remarked by Louis Figuier, are:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Frequently the outcome of the wisdom and observation of an\r\n    infinite number of generations of men.... [For], a tradition which\r\n    has a uniform and universal existence, has all the weight of\r\n    scientific testimony.(316)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd there is more than one such tradition in the Paurânic allegories, as\r\nhas been shown. Moreover, the doctrine that the First Race of mankind was\r\nformed out of the Chhâyâs, or Astral Images, of the Pitris, is fully\r\ncorroborated in the _Zohar_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the _Tzelem_, shadow image of Elohim [the Pitris], He made Adam\r\n    (man).(317)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been repeatedly urged as an objection that, however high the degree\r\nof metaphysical thought in ancient India, yet the old Egyptians had\r\nnothing but crass idolatry and zoolatry to boast of; Hermes, as alleged,\r\nbeing the work of Greek Mystics who lived in Egypt. To this, an answer can\r\nbe given: a direct proof that the Egyptians believed in the Secret\r\nDoctrine is, that it was taught to them at Initiation. Let the objectors\r\nopen the _Eclogæ Physicœ et Ethicæ_ of Stobæus, the Greek compiler of\r\nancient fragments, who lived in the fifth century, A.D. The following is a\r\ntranscription by him of an old Hermetic fragment, showing the Egyptian\r\ntheory of the Soul. Translated word for word, it says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    From one Soul, that of All, spring all the souls, which spread\r\n    themselves as if purposely distributed through the world. These\r\n    souls undergo many transformations; those which are already\r\n    creeping creatures turn into aquatic animals; from these aquatic\r\n    animals are derived land animals; and from the latter the birds.\r\n    From the beings who live aloft in the air (heaven) men are born.\r\n    On reaching that status of men, the souls receive the principle of\r\n    (conscious) immortality, become spirits, then pass into the choir\r\n    of Gods.\r\n\r\n\r\n23. THE SELF‐BORN WERE THE CHHÂYÂS, THE SHADOWS FROM THE BODIES OF THE\r\nSONS OF TWILIGHT. NEITHER WATER NOR FIRE COULD DESTROY THEM. THEIR SONS\r\nWERE.(318)\r\n\r\nThis verse cannot be understood without the help of the Commentaries. It\r\nmeans that the First Root‐Race, the “Shadows” of the Progenitors, could\r\nnot be injured, or destroyed by death. Being so ethereal and so little\r\nhuman in constitution, they could not be affected by any element—flood or\r\nfire. But their “Sons,” the Second Root‐Race, could be and were so\r\ndestroyed. As the Progenitors merged wholly in their own Astral Bodies,\r\nwhich were their progeny, so that progeny was absorbed in its descendants,\r\nthe “Sweat‐born.” These were the Second Humanity—composed of the most\r\nheterogeneous gigantic semi‐human monsters—the first attempts of material\r\nnature at building human bodies. The ever‐blooming lands (Greenland, among\r\nothers) of the Second Continent were transformed, successively, from Edens\r\nwith their eternal spring, into hyperborean Hades. This transformation was\r\ndue to the displacement of the great waters of the Globe, to oceans\r\nchanging their beds; and the bulk of the Second Race perished in this\r\nfirst great throe of the evolution and consolidation of the Globe during\r\nthe human period. Of such great cataclysms there have already been\r\nfour.(319) And we may expect a fifth for ourselves in due course of time.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Few Words About “Deluges” And “Noahs.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accounts in the various _Purânas_ about our Progenitors are as\r\ncontradictory, _in their details_, as everything else. Thus while, in the\r\n_Rig Veda_, Idâ, or Ilâ, is called the Instructress of Vaivasvata Manu,\r\nSâyana makes of her a Goddess presiding over the Earth, and the\r\n_Shatapatha Brâhmana_ shows her to be the Manu’s daughter, an offspring of\r\n_his sacrifice_, and later on, his (Vaivasvata’s) _wife, by whom he begat\r\nthe race of Manus_. In the _Purânas_ she is, again, Vaivasvata’s daughter,\r\nyet the wife of Budha (Wisdom), the illegitimate son of the Moon (Soma)\r\nand the planet Jupiter’s (Brihaspati’s) wife, Târâ. All this, which seems\r\na jumble to the profane, is full of philosophical meaning to the\r\nOccultist. On the very face of the narrative a secret and sacred meaning\r\nis perceivable; all the details, however, being so purposely mixed up that\r\nthe experienced eye of an Initiate alone can follow them and place the\r\nevents in their proper order.\r\n\r\nThe story as told in the _Mahâbhârata_ strikes the key‐note, and yet it\r\nneeds to be explained by the secret sense contained in the _Bhagavad\r\nGîtâ_. It is the _prologue_ to the drama of our (Fifth) Humanity. While\r\nVaivasvata was engaged in devotion on the river bank, a fish craves his\r\nprotection from a bigger fish. He saves it and places it in a jar; where,\r\ngrowing larger and larger, it communicates to him the news of the\r\nforthcoming Deluge. This Fish is the well‐known Matsya Avatâra, the first\r\nAvatâra of Vishnu, the Dagon(320) of the Chaldæan Xisuthrus, and many\r\nother things besides. The story is too well known to need repetition.\r\nVishnu orders a ship to be built, in which Manu is saved along with the\r\nseven Rishis, according to the _Mahâbhârata_; this, however, being absent\r\nfrom other texts. Here the seven Rishis stand for the seven Races, the\r\nseven Principles, and various other things; for there is again a double\r\nmystery involved in this manifold allegory.\r\n\r\nWe have said elsewhere that the Great Flood had several meanings, and that\r\nit referred, as also does the “Fall,” to both spiritual and physical, both\r\ncosmic and terrestrial, events: as above, so it is below. The Ship or\r\nArk—Navis—in short, being the symbol of the female generative Principle,\r\nis typified in the heavens by the Moon, and on Earth by the Womb; both\r\nbeing the vessels and bearers of the seeds of life and being, which the\r\nSun, or Vishnu, the male Principle, vivifies and fructifies. The First\r\nCosmic Flood refers to Primordial Creation, or the formation of Heaven and\r\nthe Earths; in which case Chaos and the great Deep stand for the “Flood,”\r\nand the Moon for the “Mother,” from whom proceed all the life‐germs.(321)\r\nBut the Terrestrial Deluge and its story has also its dual application. In\r\none case it has reference to that mystery when mankind was saved from\r\nutter destruction, by the mortal woman being made the receptacle of the\r\nhuman seed at the end of the Third Race,(322) and in the other to the real\r\nand historical Atlantean Submersion. In both cases the “Host”—or the Manu\r\nwhich saved the “seed”—is called Vaivasvata Manu. Hence the diversity\r\nbetween the Paurânic and other versions; while in the _Shatapatha\r\nBrâhmana_, Vaivasvata produces a daughter and begets from her the race of\r\nManu—a reference to the first human Manushyas, who had to create women by\r\nWill (Kriyâshakti), before they were naturally born from the\r\nHermaphrodites as an independent sex, and were, therefore, regarded as\r\ntheir creator’s “daughters.” The Paurânic accounts make Idâ, or Ilâ, the\r\nwife of Budha (Wisdom). This version refers to the events of the Atlantean\r\nFlood, when Vaivasvata, the great Sage on Earth, saved the Fifth Root‐Race\r\nfrom being destroyed along with the remnants of the Fourth.\r\n\r\nThis is shown very clearly in the _Bhagavad Gîtâ_, where Krishna is made\r\nto say:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The seven Great Rishis, the _four preceding_ Manus, partaking of\r\n    my essence, were born from my mind: from them sprang (was born)\r\n    the human race and the world.(323)\r\n\r\n\r\nHere the four preceding Manus, out of the seven, are the four Races(324)\r\nwhich have already lived, for Krishna belongs to the Fifth Race, his death\r\nhaving inaugurated the Kali Yuga. Thus Vaivasvata Manu, the son of Sûrya,\r\nthe Sun, and the Saviour of our Race, is connected with the “Seed of\r\nLife,” both physically and spiritually. But, at present, while speaking of\r\nall, we have to concern ourselves only with the first two.\r\n\r\nThe “Deluge” is undeniably a “universal tradition.” “Glacial Periods” were\r\nnumerous, and so were the “Deluges,” for various reasons. Stockwell and\r\nCroll enumerate some half‐dozen Glacial Periods and subsequent Deluges—the\r\nearliest of all being dated by them 850,000, and the last about 100,000\r\nyears ago.(325) But which was _our_ Deluge? Assuredly the former, the one\r\nwhich to this date remains recorded in the traditions of all the peoples\r\nfrom the remotest antiquity; the one that finally swept away the last\r\npeninsulas of Atlantis, beginning with Ruta and Daitya and ending with the\r\ncomparatively small island mentioned by Plato. This is shown by the\r\nagreement of certain details in all the legends. It was the last of its\r\ngigantic character. The little deluge, the traces of which Baron Bunsen\r\nfound in Central Asia, and which he places at about 10,000 years B.C., had\r\nnothing to do with either the _semi_‐universal Deluge, or Noah’s Flood—the\r\nlatter being a purely mythical rendering of old traditions—nor even with\r\nthe submersion of the last Atlantean island; or, at least, having with\r\nthem only a moral connection.\r\n\r\nOur Fifth Race—the non‐initiated portions of it—hearing of many Deluges,\r\nhave confused them, and now know of but one. This one altered the whole\r\naspect of the Globe in its interchange, and shifting, of land and sea.\r\n\r\nWe may compare the tradition of the Peruvians that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Incas, _seven_ in number, have repeopled the earth after the\r\n    deluge.(326)\r\n\r\n\r\nHumboldt mentions the Mexican version of the same legend, but confuses\r\nsomewhat the details of the still‐preserved legend concerning the American\r\nNoah. Nevertheless, the eminent Naturalist mentions _twice seven_\r\ncompanions and the “divine bird” which preceded the boat of the Aztecs,\r\nand thus makes fifteen elect instead of the seven and the fourteen. This\r\nwas written probably under some involuntary reminiscence of Moses, who is\r\nsaid to have mentioned fifteen grandsons of Noah, who escaped with their\r\ngrandsire. Then again Xisuthrus, the Chaldæan Noah, is saved and\r\ntranslated “alive” to heaven—like Enoch—with the seven Gods, the Kabirim,\r\nor the seven divine Titans. Again the Chinese Yao has _seven_ figures\r\nwhich sail with him and which he will “animate” when he lands, and use for\r\n“human seed.” Osiris, when he enters the Ark, or Solar Boat, takes _seven_\r\nRays with him, etc.\r\n\r\nSanchuniathon makes the Aletæ or Titans (the Kabirim) contemporary with\r\nAgruerus, the great Phœnician God—whom Faber sought to identify with\r\nNoah;(327) further, it is suspected that the name “Titan” is derived from\r\nTit‐Ain,—the “fountains of the chaotic abyss”(328) (Tit‐Theus, or Tityus\r\nis the “divine deluge”); and thus the Titans, who are _seven_, are shown\r\nto be connected with the Flood and the seven Rishis saved by Vaivasvata\r\nManu.(329)\r\n\r\nThese Titans are the sons of Kronos, Time, and Rhea, the Earth; and as\r\nAgruerus, Saturn and Sydyk are one and the same personage, and as the\r\nseven Kabiri are also said to be the sons of Sydyk or Kronos‐Saturn, the\r\nKabiri and Titans are identical. For once the pious Faber was right in his\r\nconclusions when he wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I have no doubt of the seven Titans or Cabiri being the same also\r\n    as the seven Rishis of the Hindoo mythology (?), who are said to\r\n    have escaped in a boat along with Menu the head (?) of the\r\n    family.(330)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut he is less fortunate in his speculations when he adds:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Hindoos, in their wild _legends_ have variously perverted the\r\n    _history_ of the Noachidæ (? !), yet it is remarkable that they\r\n    seem to have religiously adhered to the number seven:(331) hence\r\n    Capt. Wilford very judiciously observes, that, “perhaps, the seven\r\n    Menus, the seven Brahmâdicas, with the seven Rishis, are the same,\r\n    and make only seven individual persons.(332) The seven Brahmâdicas\r\n    were _prajâpatis_, or lords of the _prajas_, or creatures. From\r\n    them mankind was born, and they are probably the same with the\r\n    seven Menus.... These seven grand ancestors of the human race were\r\n    ... created for the purpose of replenishing the earth with\r\n    inhabitants.”(333) The mutual resemblance of the Cabiri, the\r\n    Titans, the Rishis, and the Noëtic family, is too striking to be\r\n    the effect of mere accident.(334)\r\n\r\n\r\nFaber was led into this mistake, and subsequently built his entire theory\r\nconcerning the Kabiri, on the fact that the name of the scriptural Japhet\r\nis on the list of the Titans contained in a verse of the Orphic Hymns.\r\nAccording to Orpheus the names of the seven Arkite Titans—whom Faber\r\nrefuses to identify with the _impious_ Titans, their descendants—were\r\nKœus, Krœus, Phorcys, Cronus, Oceanus, Hyperion, and _Iapetus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Κοιον τε, Κροιον τε μεγαν, Φορκυν τε κραταιον,\r\n    Και Κρονον, Ὠκεανον θ᾽, Ὑπεριονα τ᾽, Ἰαπετον τε.(335)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut why could not the Babylonian Ezra have adopted the name of Iapetus for\r\none of Noah’s sons? The Kabiri, who are the Titans, are also called Manes\r\nand their mother Mania, according to Arnobius.(336) The Hindûs can\r\ntherefore claim with far more reason that the Manes mean their Manus, and\r\nthat Mania is the _female_ Manu of the _Râmâyana_. Mania is Ilâ, or Idâ,\r\nthe wife and daughter of Vaivasvata Manu, from whom “he begat the race of\r\nManus.” Like Rhea, the mother of the Titans, she is the Earth—Sâyana\r\nmaking her the Goddess of the Earth—and she is but the second edition and\r\nrepetition of Vâch. Both Idâ and Vâch are turned into males and females;\r\nIdâ becoming Sudyumna, and Vâch, the “female Virâj,” turning into a woman\r\nin order to punish the Gandharvas; one version referring to cosmic and\r\ndivine Theogony, the other to the later period. The Manes and Mania of\r\nArnobius are names of Indian origin, appropriated by the Greeks and Latins\r\nand disfigured by them.\r\n\r\nThus it is no accident, but the result of one archaic doctrine, common to\r\nall, of which the Israëlites, through Ezra, the author of the modernized\r\nMosaic books, were the latest adapters. So unceremonious were they with\r\nother people’s property, that the Pseudo‐Berosus,(337) shows that Titæa—of\r\nwhom Diodorus Siculus(338) makes the mother of the Titans or Diluvians—was\r\nthe _wife of Noah_. Faber calls him the “Pseudo‐Berosus,” yet accepts the\r\ninformation in order to register one proof more that the Pagans have\r\nborrowed all their Gods from the Jews, by transforming patriarchal\r\nmaterial. According to our humble opinion, this is one of the best proofs\r\npossible of exactly the reverse. It shows as clearly as facts can show,\r\nthat it is the Biblical pseudo‐personages which are all borrowed from\r\nPagan myths, if myths they must be. It shows, at any rate, that Berosus\r\nwas well aware of the source of _Genesis_, and that it bore the same\r\ncosmic astronomical character as the allegories of Isis‐Osiris, and the\r\nArk, and other older “Arkite” symbols. For, Berosus says that “Titæa\r\nMagna” was afterwards called Aretia,(339) and worshipped with the Earth;\r\nand this identifies Titæa, Noah’s consort, with Rhea, the Mother of the\r\nTitans, and with Idâ; both being Goddesses who preside over the Earth, and\r\nthe Mothers of the Manus and Manes, or Titan‐Kabiri. And Titæa‐Aretia was\r\nworshipped as Horchia, says the same Berosus, and this is a title of\r\nVesta, Goddess of the Earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Sicanus deificavit Aretiam, et nominavit eam linguâ Janigenâ\r\n    Horchiam.(340)\r\n\r\n\r\nScarcely an ancient poet of historic or prehistoric days fails to mention\r\nthe sinking of the two continents—often called isles—in one form or\r\nanother. Hence the destruction, besides Atlantis, of the Phlegyan Island.\r\nPausanius and Nonnus both tell how:\r\n\r\n\r\n    From its deep‐rooted base the Phlegyan isle\r\n    Stern Neptune shook, and plunged beneath the waves\r\n    Its impious inhabitants.(341)\r\n\r\n\r\nFaber felt convinced that the Phlegyan Island was Atlantis. But all such\r\nallegories are more or less distorted echoes of the Hindû tradition about\r\nthat great Cataclysm, which befell the Fourth, really human, though\r\ngigantic, Race, the one which preceded the Âryan. Yet, as just said, like\r\nall other legends, the legend of the Deluge has more than one meaning. It\r\nrefers, in Theogony, to _pre‐cosmic transformations_, to _spiritual\r\ncorrelations_—however absurd the term may sound to a scientific ear—and\r\nalso to subsequent Cosmogony; to the great Flood of Waters (Matter) in\r\nChaos, awakened and fructified by those Spirit‐Rays which were swamped by,\r\nand _perished_ in, the mysterious differentiation—a pre‐cosmic mystery,\r\nthe Prologue to the drama of Being. Anu, Bel, and Noah preceded Adam\r\nKadmon, Adam the Red, and Noah; just as Brahmâ, Vishnu, and Shiva preceded\r\nVaivasvata and the rest.(342)\r\n\r\nAll this goes to show that the _semi_‐universal deluge known to\r\nGeology—the first Glacial Period—must have occurred just at the time\r\nallotted to it by the Secret Doctrine: namely, 200,000 years, in round\r\nnumbers, after the commencement of our Fifth Race, or about the time\r\nassigned by Messrs. Croll and Stockwell for the first Glacial Period:\r\n_i.e._, about 850,000 years ago. Thus, as the latter disturbance is\r\nattributed by Geologists and Astronomers to “an extreme eccentricity of\r\nthe earth’s orbit,” and as the Secret Doctrine attributes it to the same\r\nsource, but with the addition of another factor, the shifting of the\r\nEarth’s axis—a proof of which may be found in the _Book of Enoch_,(343) if\r\nthe veiled language of the _Purânas_ be not understood—all this should\r\ntend to show that the Ancients knew something of the “modern discoveries”\r\nof Science. Enoch, when speaking of “the great inclination of the Earth,”\r\nwhich “is in travail,” is quite significant and clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Is not this evident? Nuah is Noah, _floating on the waters_ in his\r\n    ark; the latter being the emblem of the Argha, or Moon, the\r\n    feminine Principle; Noah is the “Spirit” falling into Matter. We\r\n    find him, as soon as he descends upon the Earth, planting a\r\n    vineyard, drinking of the wine, and getting drunk thereon, _i.e._,\r\n    the pure Spirit becomes intoxicated as soon as it is finally\r\n    imprisoned in Matter. The seventh chapter of _Genesis_ is only\r\n    another version of the first. Thus, while the latter reads: “And\r\n    darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God\r\n    moved upon the face of the waters”; in the former it is said: “And\r\n    the waters prevailed; ... and the ark went [with Noah, the Spirit]\r\n    upon the face of the waters.” Thus Noah, if identical with the\r\n    Chaldæan Nuah, is the Spirit vivifying Matter, which latter is\r\n    Chaos, represented by the Deep, or the Waters of the Flood. In the\r\n    Babylonian legend (the pre‐cosmical blended with the terrestrial\r\n    event) it is Istar (Ashteroth, or Venus, the Lunar Goddess) who is\r\n    shut up in the ark and sends out a _dove_ in search of dry\r\n    land.(344)\r\n\r\n    George Smith notes in the “Tablets,” first the creation of the\r\n    Moon, and then that of the Sun: “Its beauty and perfection are\r\n    extolled, and the regularity of its orbit, which led to its being\r\n    considered the type of a judge and the regulator of the world.” If\r\n    this story related simply to a cosmogonical cataclysm‐even were\r\n    this latter universal‐why should the goddess Istar or Ashteroth,\r\n    the Moon, speak of the _creation of the sun_ after the deluge? The\r\n    waters might have reached as high as the mountain of Nizir of the\r\n    Chaldæan version, or Jebel Djudi, the deluge mountains of the\r\n    Arabian legend, or yet Ararat of the Biblical narrative, and even\r\n    the Himalaya of the Hindû tradition, and yet not have reached the\r\n    Sun; the _Bible_ itself stopped short of such a miracle! It is\r\n    evident that the deluge to the people who first recorded it had\r\n    another meaning, less problematical and far more philosophical\r\n    than that of a _universal_ deluge, of which there are no\r\n    geological traces whatever.(345)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs all such Cataclysms are periodical and cyclical, and as Manu Vaivasvata\r\nfigures as a _generic_ character, under various circumstances and events,\r\nthere seems to be no serious objection to the supposition that the first\r\n“great flood” had an allegorical, as well as a cosmic meaning, and that it\r\nhappened at the end of the Satya Yuga, the “Age of Truth,” when the Second\r\nRoot‐Race, “the Manu with bones,” made its primeval appearance as the\r\n“Sweat‐born.”\r\n\r\nThe Second Flood—the so‐called “universal”—which affected the Fourth Root‐\r\nRace—now conveniently regarded by Theology as “the accursed race of\r\ngiants,” the Cainites, and the “sons of Ham”—is the flood which was first\r\nperceived by Geology. If one carefully compares the accounts in the\r\nvarious legends of the Chaldees and other exoteric works of the nations,\r\nit will be found that all of them agree with the orthodox narratives given\r\nin the Brâhmanical books. And it may be perceived that while, in the first\r\naccount, “there is no God or mortal yet on Earth,” when Manu Vaivasvata\r\nlands on Himavân, in the second, the Seven Rishis are allowed to keep him\r\ncompany; thus showing that whereas some accounts refer to the Sidereal and\r\nCosmic Flood before the so‐called “Creation,” the others treat, one of the\r\nGreat Flood of Matter on Earth, and the other of a real watery deluge. In\r\nthe _Shatapatha Brâhmana_, Manu finds that the Flood had swept away all\r\nliving creatures, and he alone was left—_i.e._, _the seed of life_ alone\r\nremained from the previous Dissolution of the Universe, or Mahâpralaya,\r\nafter a “Day of Brahmâ”; and the _Mahâbhârata_ refers simply to the\r\ngeological cataclysm which swept away nearly all the Fourth Race to make\r\nroom for the Fifth. Therefore is Vaivasvata Manu shown under three\r\ndistinct attributes in our Esoteric Cosmogony:(346) as the “Root‐Manu,” on\r\nGlobe A, in the First Round; (_b_) as the “_Seed_ of Life,” on Globe D, in\r\nthe Fourth Round; and (_c_) as the “Seed of Man,” at the beginning of\r\nevery Root‐Race—in our Fifth Race especially. The very commencement of the\r\nlatter witnesses, during the Dvâpara Yuga,(347) the destruction of the\r\naccursed sorcerers;\r\n\r\n\r\n    Of that island [Plato speaks only of its last island] beyond the\r\n    Pillars of Hercules, in the Atlantic Ocean, from which there was\r\n    an easy transition to other islands in the neighbourhood of\r\n    another _large continent_ [America].\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is this Atlantic Land which was connected with the “White Island,” and\r\nthis White Island was Ruta; but it was not the Atala and the “White Devil”\r\nof Colonel Wilford,(348) as already shown. It may well be remarked here\r\nthat the Dvâpara Yuga lasts 864,000 years, according to the Sanskrit\r\ntexts; and that, if the Kali Yuga began only about 5,000 years ago, that\r\nit is just 869,000 years since that destruction took place. Again, these\r\nfigures are not very widely different from those given by the Geologists,\r\nwho place their Glacial Period at 850,000 years ago.\r\n\r\nThe _Shatapatha_ then tells us that a woman was produced who came to Manu\r\nand declared _herself his daughter, with whom he lived and begat the\r\noffspring of Manu_. This refers to the physiological transformation of\r\nsexes during the Third Root‐Race. And the allegory is too transparently\r\nclear to need much explanation. Of course, as already remarked, in the\r\nseparation of sexes an androgyne being was supposed to divide his body\r\ninto two halves—as in the case of Brahmâ and Vâch, and even of Adam and\r\nEve—and thus the female is, in a certain sense, his daughter, just as he\r\nwill be her son, “the flesh of his [and her] flesh and the bone of his\r\n[and her] bone.” Let it be also well remembered that not one of our\r\nOrientalists has yet learned to discern in those “contradictions and\r\namazing nonsense,” as some call the _Purânas_, that a reference to a Yuga\r\nmay mean a Round, a Root‐Race, and often a sub‐race, as well as form a\r\npage torn out of pre‐cosmic Theogony. This double and triple meaning is\r\nproved by various references to one and the same individual apparently,\r\nunder an identical name, while in reality the references are to events\r\ndivided by entire Kalpas. A good instance is that of Ilâ. She is first\r\nrepresented as one thing and then as another. In the exoteric legends it\r\nis said that Manu Vaivasvata, desiring to create sons, instituted a\r\nsacrifice to Mitra and Varuna; but, through a mistake of the officiating\r\nBrâhman, a daughter only was obtained—Ilâ or Idâ. Then, “through the\r\nfavour of the two deities,” her _sex is changed_ and she becomes a man,\r\nSudyumna. Then she is again turned into a woman, and so on; the fable\r\nadding that Shiva and his consort were pleased that “she should be a male\r\none month and a female another.” This has a direct reference to the Third\r\nRoot‐Race, whose men were androgynes. But some very learned\r\nOrientalists(349) think and have declared that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Idâ is primarily food, nourishment, or a libation of milk; thence\r\n    a stream of praise, personified as the goddess of speech.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “profane” are not told, however, the reason why “a libation of milk,”\r\nor “a stream of praise,” should be _male_ and _female_ by turn: unless,\r\nindeed, there is some “internal evidence” which the Occultists fail to\r\nperceive.\r\n\r\nIn its most mystical meaning, the union of Svâyambhuva Manu with Vâch‐\r\nShata‐Rûpâ, his own daughter—this being the first “euhemerization” of the\r\ndual principle of which Vaivasvata Manu and Ilâ are a secondary and a\r\nthird form—stands in cosmic symbolism as the Root‐Life, the Germ from\r\nwhich spring all the Solar Systems, the Worlds, Angels and the Gods. For,\r\nas says Vishnu:\r\n\r\n\r\n    From Manu all creation, gods, Asuras, man must be produced:\r\n    By him the world must be created, that which moves and moveth not.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut we may find worse opponents than even the Western Scientists and\r\nOrientalists. If, on the question of figures, Brâhmans may agree with our\r\nteaching, we are not so sure that some of the orthodox conservatives may\r\nnot raise objections to the modes of procreation attributed to their Pitri\r\nDevatâs. We shall be called upon to produce the works from which we quote,\r\nand we will invite them to read their own _Purânas_ a little more\r\ncarefully and with an eye to the esoteric meaning. And then, we repeat\r\nagain, they will find, under the veil of more or less transparent\r\nallegories, every statement made herein corroborated by their own works.\r\nOne or two instances have already been given as regards the appearance of\r\nthe Second Race, which is called the “Sweat‐born.” This allegory is\r\nregarded as a fairy‐tale, and yet it conceals a psycho‐physiological\r\nphenomenon, and one of the greatest mysteries of Nature.\r\n\r\nBut in view of the chronological statements made herein, it is natural to\r\nask:\r\n\r\nCOULD MEN EXIST 18,000,000 YEARS AGO?\r\n\r\nTo this Occultism answers in the affirmative, notwithstanding all\r\nscientific objectors. Moreover, this duration covers only the Vaivasvata‐\r\nManu Man, _i.e._, the male and female entity already separated into\r\ndistinct sexes. The two and a half Races that preceded that event may have\r\nlived 300,000,000 years ago for all that Science can tell. For the\r\ngeological and physical difficulties in the way of the theory could not\r\nexist for the _primeval, ethereal_ Man of the Occult Teachings. _The whole\r\nissue of the quarrel between the Profane and the Esoteric Sciences depends\r\nupon the belief in, and demonstration of, the existence of an Astral Body\r\nwithin the Physical_, the former independent of the latter. Paul d’Assier,\r\nthe Positivist, seems to have proven the fact pretty plainly,(350) not to\r\nspeak of the accumulated testimony of the ages, and that of the modern\r\n“Spiritualists” and Mystics. It will be found difficult to reject this\r\nfact in our age of proofs, tests, and ocular demonstrations.\r\n\r\nThe Secret Doctrine maintains that, notwithstanding the general cataclysms\r\nand disturbances of the Fourth Round of our Globe, which—owing to its\r\nbeing the period of its greatest physical development, for the Fourth\r\nRound is the middle‐point of the Life Cycle allotted to it—were far more\r\nterrible and intense than during any of the three preceding Rounds—the\r\nCycles of its earlier psychic and spiritual life and of its semi‐ethereal\r\nconditions—Physical Humanity has existed upon it for the last 18,000,000\r\nyears.(351) This period was preceded by 300,000,000 years of the mineral\r\nand vegetable development. To this, all those who refuse to accept the\r\ntheory of a “boneless,” purely ethereal, man, will object. Science, which\r\nknows only of physical organisms, will feel indignant; and materialistic\r\nTheology still more so. The former will object on logical and reasonable\r\ngrounds, based on the preconception that all animate organisms have always\r\nexisted on the same plane of materiality in all the ages; the latter on a\r\ntissue of most absurd fictions. The ridiculous claim usually brought\r\nforward by Theologians is based on the virtual assumption that mankind\r\n(read Christians) on this Planet have the honour of being the only human\r\nbeings in the whole Kosmos, who dwell on a Globe, and that they are\r\nconsequently, the best of their kind.(352)\r\n\r\nThe Occultists, who believe firmly in the teachings of the Mother‐\r\nPhilosophy, repel the objections of both Theologians and Scientists. They\r\nmaintain, on their side, that, even during those periods when there must\r\nhave been insufferable heat, even at the two poles, with successive\r\nfloods, upheaval of the valleys and constant shifting of the great waters\r\nand seas, none of these circumstances could form an impediment to human\r\nlife and organization, such _as is assigned by them_ to early mankind.\r\nNeither the heterogeneity of ambient regions, full of deleterious gases,\r\nnor the perils of a crust hardly consolidated, could prevent the First and\r\nSecond Races from making their appearance even during the Carboniferous,\r\nor the Silurian Age itself.\r\n\r\nThus the Monads destined to animate future Races were ready for the new\r\ntransformation. They had passed their phases of “immetalization,” of plant\r\nand animal life, from the lowest to the highest, and were waiting for\r\ntheir human, more intelligent form. Yet what could the Plastic Modellers\r\ndo but follow the laws of evolutionary Nature? Could they, as claimed by\r\nthe biblical dead‐letter, form, “Lord‐God”‐like, or as Pygmalion in the\r\nGreek allegory, Adam‐Galatea out of volcanic dust, and breathe a “Living\r\nSoul” into Man? No; because the Soul was already there, latent in its\r\nMonad, and needed but a “coating.” Pygmalion, who fails to _animate his\r\nstatue_, and Bahak Zivo of the Nazaræan Gnostics, who fails to construct\r\n“a human soul in the creature,” are, as conceptions, far more\r\nphilosophical and scientific than Adam, taken in the dead‐letter sense, or\r\nthe biblical Elohim‐Creators. Esoteric Philosophy, which teaches\r\nspontaneous generation—after the Shishta and Prajâpati have thrown the\r\nseed of life on the Earth—shows the Lower Angels able to construct\r\n_physical_ man only, even with the help of Nature, after having evolved\r\nthe Ethereal Form out of themselves, and leaving the physical form to\r\nevolve gradually from its ethereal, or what would now be called,\r\nprotoplasmic, model.\r\n\r\nThis will again be objected to; “spontaneous generation” is an exploded\r\ntheory, we shall be told. Pasteur’s experiments disposed of it twenty\r\nyears ago, and Professor Tyndall is against it. Well, suppose he is? He\r\nought to know that, should spontaneous generation be indeed proven\r\nimpossible in our present world‐period and actual conditions—which the\r\nOccultists deny—still it would be no demonstration that it could not have\r\ntaken place under different cosmic conditions, not only in the seas of the\r\nLaurentian Period, but even on the then convulsed Earth. It would be\r\ninteresting to know how Science could ever account for the appearance of\r\nspecies and life on Earth, especially of Man, once that she rejects both\r\nthe biblical teachings and spontaneous generation. Pasteur’s observations,\r\nhowever, are far from being perfect or proven. Blanchard and Dr. Lutaud\r\nreject their importance, and, in fact, show that they have none. The\r\nquestion is so far left _sub judice_, as well as the other as to when, at\r\nwhat period, life appeared on the Earth? As to the idea that Hæckel’s\r\nMoneron—a pinch of salt!—has solved the problem of the origin of life; it\r\nis simply absurd. Those Materialists, who feel inclined to pooh‐pooh the\r\ntheory of the “Self‐existent,” the “Self‐born Heavenly Man,” represented\r\nas an Ethereal, Astral Man, must excuse even a tyro in Occultism laughing,\r\nin his turn, at some speculations of Modern Thought. After proving most\r\nlearnedly that the primitive speck of Protoplasm (Moneron) is neither\r\nanimal nor plant, but both, and that it has _no ancestors_ among either of\r\nthese, since it is that Moneron which serves as a point of departure for\r\nall organized existence, we are finally told that the Monera are _their\r\nown ancestors_. This may be very scientific, but it is very metaphysical\r\nalso; too much so, even for the Occultist.\r\n\r\nIf spontaneous generation has changed its methods now—owing, perhaps, to\r\naccumulated material on hand—so as to almost escape detection, it was,\r\nnevertheless, in full swing in the genesis of terrestrial life. Even the\r\nsimple physical form and the evolution of species show how Nature\r\nproceeds. The scale‐bound, gigantic Saurian, the winged Pterodactyl, the\r\nMegalosaurus, and the hundred feet long Iguanodon of the later period, are\r\nthe transformations of the earliest representatives of the animal kingdom\r\nfound in the sediments of the primary epoch. There was a time when all the\r\nabove enumerated “antediluvian” monsters appeared as filamentoid Infusoria\r\nwithout shell or crust, with neither nerves, muscles, organs nor sex, and\r\nreproduced their kind by gemmation; as do microscopical animals also, the\r\narchitects and builders of our mountain ranges, agreeably to the teachings\r\nof Science. Why not man in this case? Why should he not have followed the\r\nsame law in his growth, _i.e._, gradual condensation? Every unprejudiced\r\nperson would prefer to believe that Primeval Humanity had at first an\r\nEthereal—or, if so preferred, a huge filamentoid, jelly‐like Form, evolved\r\nby Gods or natural “Forces,” which grew, condensed throughout millions of\r\nages, and became gigantic in its physical impulse and tendency, until it\r\nsettled into the huge, physical form of the Fourth Race Man—rather than\r\nbelieve him created of the dust of the Earth (literally), or from some\r\nunknown anthropoid ancestor.\r\n\r\nNor does our Esoteric theory clash with scientific data, except on first\r\nappearance, as Dr. A. Wilson, F.R.S., says, in a letter to _Knowledge_\r\n(Dec. 23, 1881):\r\n\r\n\r\n    Evolution—rather nature, in the light of evolution—has only been\r\n    studied for some _twenty‐five years or so_. That is, of course, a\r\n    mere fractional space in the history of human thought.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd just because of this we do not lose all hope that Materialistic\r\nScience will amend its ways, and will gradually accept the Esoteric\r\nTeachings—if even at first divorced from their (to Science) too\r\nmetaphysical elements.\r\n\r\nHas the last word on the subject of human evolution yet been said? As\r\nProcessor Huxley says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Each such answer to the great question [man’s real place in\r\n    nature], invariably asserted by the followers of its propounder,\r\n    if not by himself, to be _complete and final_, remains in high\r\n    authority and esteem, it may be for one century, it may be for\r\n    twenty: but, as invariably, Time proves each reply to have been a\r\n    _mere approximation to the truth—tolerable chiefly on account of\r\n    the ignorance of those by whom it was accepted, and wholly\r\n    intolerable when tested by the larger knowledge of their\r\n    successors_.(353)\r\n\r\n\r\nWill this eminent Darwinian admit the possibility of his “Pithecoid\r\nAncestry” being assignable to the list of “wholly intolerable beliefs,” in\r\nthe “larger knowledge” of Occultists? But whence the savage? Mere “rising\r\nto the civilized state” does not account for the evolution of form.\r\n\r\nIn the same letter, “The Evolution of Man,” Dr. Wilson makes other strange\r\nconfessions. Thus, he observes, in answer to the queries put to\r\n_Knowledge_, by “G. M.”:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Has evolution effected any change in man? If so, what change? If\r\n    not, why not?”... If we refuse to admit [as science does] that man\r\n    was created a perfect being, and then became degraded, there\r\n    exists only another supposition—that of evolution. If man has\r\n    arisen from a savage to a civilized state, that surely is\r\n    evolution. _We do not yet know because such knowledge is difficult\r\n    to acquire, if the human frame is subject to the same influences\r\n    as those of lower animals._ But there is little doubt that\r\n    elevation from savagery to civilized life means and implies\r\n    “evolution,” and that of considerable extent. Mentally, man’s\r\n    evolution cannot be doubted; the ever‐widening sphere of thought\r\n    has sprung from small and rude beginnings, like language itself.\r\n    But man’s ways of life, his power of adaptation to his\r\n    surroundings, and countless other circumstances, have made the\r\n    facts and course of his “evolution” very difficult to trace.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis very difficulty ought to make the Evolutionists more cautious in\r\ntheir affirmations. But why is evolution impossible, if “man was created a\r\nperfect being, and then became degraded”? At best it can only apply to the\r\n_outward, physical man_. As remarked in _Isis Unveiled_, Darwin’s\r\nevolution begins at the middle point, instead of commencing for man, as\r\nfor everything else, from universals. The Aristotle‐Baconian method may\r\nhave its advantages, but it has, undeniably, already demonstrated its\r\ndefects. Pythagoras and Plato, who proceeded from universals downwards,\r\nare now shown more learned, in the light of Modern Science, than was\r\nAristotle. For the latter opposed and denounced the idea of the revolution\r\nof the Earth and even of its rotundity, when writing:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Almost all those who affirm that they have studied heaven in its\r\n    uniformity, claim that the earth is in the centre, but the\r\n    philosophers of the Italian School, otherwise called the\r\n    Pythagoreans, teach entirely the contrary.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis, because the Pythagoreans were Initiates, and followed the deductive\r\nmethod. Whereas Aristotle, the father of the inductive system, complained\r\nof those who taught that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The centre of our system was occupied by the sun, and the earth\r\n    was only a star, which by a rotatory motion around the same\r\n    centre, produces night and day.(354)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same with regard to man. The theory taught in the Secret Doctrine, and\r\nnow expounded, is the only one, which—without falling into the absurdity\r\nof a “miraculous” man created out of the dust of the earth, or the still\r\ngreater fallacy of man evolving from a pinch of lime‐salt, the ex‐\r\nprotoplasmic Moneron—can account for his appearance on Earth.\r\n\r\n_Analogy_ is the guiding law in Nature, the only true Ariadne’s thread\r\nthat can lead us, through the inextricable paths of her domain, toward her\r\nprimal and final mysteries. Nature, as a creative potency, is infinite,\r\nand no generation of Physical Scientists can ever boast of having\r\nexhausted the list of her ways and methods, however uniform the laws upon\r\nwhich she proceeds. If we can conceive of a ball of “fire‐mist”—as it\r\nrolls through æons of time in the interstellar spaces—becoming gradually a\r\nPlanet, a self‐luminous Globe, to settle into a _man‐bearing_ World or\r\nEarth, thus having passed from a soft plastic body into a rock‐bound\r\nGlobe; and if we see on it everything evolving from the non‐nucleated\r\njelly‐speck that becomes the Sarcode(355) of the Moneron, then passes from\r\nits protistic state(356) into the form of an animal, to grow into a\r\ngigantic reptilian monster of the Mesozoic times; then dwindling again\r\ninto the (comparatively) dwarfish crocodile, now confined solely to\r\ntropical regions, and the universally common lizard(357)—if we can\r\nconceive all this, then how can man alone escape the general law? “There\r\nwere giants on earth in those days” says _Genesis_, repeating the\r\nstatement of all the other Eastern Scriptures; and the Titans are founded\r\non an anthropological and physiological fact.\r\n\r\nAnd, as the hard‐shelled crustacean was once upon a time a jelly‐speck, a\r\n“thoroughly homogeneous particle of albumen in a firmly adhesive\r\ncondition,” so was the outward covering of primitive man, his early “coat\r\nof skin,” _plus_ an immortal spiritual Monad, and a psychic temporary form\r\nand body within that shell. The modern, hard, muscular man, almost\r\nimpervious to any climate, was, perhaps, some 25,000,000 years ago, just\r\nwhat the Hæckelian Moneron is, strictly an “organism without organs,” an\r\nentirely homogeneous substance with a structureless albumen body within,\r\nand a human form only outwardly.\r\n\r\nNo man of Science has the right, in this century, to find the figures of\r\nthe Brâhmans in the question of chronology preposterous; for their own\r\ncalculations often exceed by far the claims made by Esoteric Science. This\r\nmay easily be shown.\r\n\r\nHelmholtz calculated that the cooling of our Earth from a temperature of\r\n2,000° to 200° Cent. must have occupied a period of no less than\r\n350,000,000 years. Western Science (including Geology) seems generally to\r\nallow our Globe an age of about 500,000,000 years altogether. Sir William\r\nThomson, however, limits the appearance of the earliest vegetable life to\r\n100,000,000 years ago—a statement respectfully contradicted by the Archaic\r\nRecords. Speculations, furthermore, vary daily in the domains of Science.\r\nMeanwhile, some Geologists are very much opposed to such limitation.\r\nVolger calculates:\r\n\r\n\r\n    That the time requisite for the deposit of the strata known to us\r\n    must at least have amounted to 648 millions of years.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth time and space are infinite and eternal.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The earth, as a material existence, is indeed infinite; the\r\n    changes only which it has undergone can be determined by finite\r\n    periods of time....\r\n\r\n    We must therefore assume that the starry heaven is not merely in\r\n    space, which no astronomer doubts, but also in time, without\r\n    beginning or end; that it never was created, and is\r\n    imperishable.(358)\r\n\r\n\r\nCzolbe repeats exactly what the Occultists say. But the Âryan Occultists,\r\nwe may be told, knew nothing of these later speculations. As Coleman says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    They were even ignorant of the globular form of our earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this the _Vishnu Purâna_ contains a reply, which has forced certain\r\nOrientalists to open their eyes very wide.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The sun is stationed, for all time, in the middle of the day, and\r\n    over against mid‐night, in all the Dvîpas [Continents], Maitreya.\r\n    But the rising and the setting _of the sun_ being perpetually\r\n    opposite _to each other_,—and, in the same way, all the cardinal\r\n    points, and so the cross‐points, Maitreya, people speak of the\r\n    rising of the sun where they see it; and where the sun disappears,\r\n    there, _to them_, is his setting. Of the sun, which is always _in\r\n    one and the same place_, there is neither setting nor rising; for\r\n    what is called rising and setting are _only_ the seeing and the\r\n    not seeing the sun.(359)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this Fitzedward Hall remarks:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The heliocentricism taught in this passage is remarkable. It is\r\n    contradicted, however, a little further on.(360)\r\n\r\n\r\nContradicted _purposely_, because it was a secret temple‐teaching. Martin\r\nHaug remarked the same teaching in another passage. It is useless to\r\ncalumniate the Âryans any longer.\r\n\r\nTo return to the chronology of the Geologists and Anthropologists. We are\r\nafraid Science has no reasonable grounds on which she could oppose the\r\nviews of the Occultists in this direction. Except that “of man, the\r\nhighest organic being of creation, not a trace was found in the primary\r\nstrata; only in the uppermost, the so‐called alluvial layer,” is all that\r\ncan be urged, so far. That man was _not the last member in the mammalian\r\nfamily_, but the _first_ in _this_ Round, is something that Science will\r\nbe forced to acknowledge one day. A similar view also has already been\r\nmooted in France on very high authority.\r\n\r\nThat man can be shown to have lived in the Mid‐Tertiary Period, and in a\r\ngeological age _when there did not yet exist one single specimen of the\r\nnow known species of mammals_, is a statement that Science _cannot_ deny\r\nand which has now been proven by de Quatrefages.(361) But even supposing\r\nhis existence in the Eocene Period is not yet demonstrated, what period of\r\ntime has elapsed since the Cretaceous Period? We are aware of the fact\r\nthat only the boldest Geologists dare place man further back than the\r\nMiocene Age. But how long, we ask, is the duration of those ages and\r\nperiods since the Mesozoic time? On this, after a good deal of speculation\r\nand wrangling, Science is silent, the greatest authorities upon the\r\nsubject being compelled to answer to the question: “We do not know.” This\r\nought to show that the men of Science are no greater authorities in this\r\nmatter than are the profane. If, according to Professor Huxley, “the time\r\nrepresented by the Coal formation alone would be six millions of\r\nyears,”(362) how many more millions would be required to cover the time\r\nfrom the Jurassic Period, or the middle of the so‐called Reptilian\r\nAge—when the Third Race appeared—up to the Miocene, when the bulk of the\r\nFourth Race was submerged?(363)\r\n\r\nThe writer is aware that those specialists, whose computations of the ages\r\nof the Globe and Man are the most liberal, have always had the shyer\r\nmajority against them. But this proves very little, since the majority\r\nrarely, if ever, turns out to be right in the long run. Harvey stood alone\r\nfor many years. The advocates for crossing the Atlantic with steamers were\r\nin danger of ending their days in a lunatic asylum. Mesmer is classed to\r\nthis day—in the Encyclopædias—along with Cagliostro and St. Germain, as a\r\ncharlatan and impostor. And now that Messrs. Charcot and Richet have\r\nvindicated Mesmer’s claims, and that Mesmerism under its new name of\r\n“Hypnotism”—a false nose on a very old face—is accepted by Science, it\r\ndoes not strengthen our respect for that majority, when we see the ease\r\nand unconcern with which its members treat of “Hypnotism,” of “telepathic\r\nimpacts,” and its other phenomena. They speak of it, in short, as if they\r\nhad believed therein since the days of Solomon, and had not, only a few\r\nyears ago, called its votaries lunatics and impostors!(364)\r\n\r\nThe same revulsion of thought is in store for the long period of years\r\nwhich Esoteric Philosophy claims as the age of sexual and physiological\r\nmankind. Therefore even the Stanza which says: “_The Mind‐born, the\r\nboneless, gave being to the Will‐born with bones_;”—adding that this took\r\nplace in the middle of the Third Race 18,000,000 years ago—has yet a\r\nchance of being accepted by future Scientists.\r\n\r\nAs far as nineteenth century thought is concerned, we shall be told, even\r\nby some personal friends who are imbued with an abnormal respect for the\r\nshifting conclusions of Science, that such a statement is absurd. How much\r\nmore improbable will appear our further assertion, viz., that the\r\nantiquity of the First Race dates back millions of years beyond this\r\nagain. For, although the exact figures are withheld—and it is out of the\r\nquestion to refer the incipient evolution of the primeval Divine Races\r\nwith _certainty_ to either the early Secondary, or the Primary Ages of\r\nGeology—one thing is clear, that the figures 18,000,000 of years, which\r\nembrace the duration of _sexual, physical_, man, have to be enormously\r\nincreased if the whole process of spiritual, astral and physical\r\ndevelopment is taken into account. Many Geologists, indeed, consider that\r\nthe duration of the Quaternary and Tertiary Ages demands the concession of\r\nsuch an estimate; and it is quite certain that no terrestrial conditions\r\nwhatever negative the hypothesis of an Eocene man, if evidence for his\r\nreality is forthcoming. Occultists, who maintain that the above date\r\ncarries us far back into the Secondary or “Reptilian” Age, may refer to M.\r\nde Quatrefages in support of the possible existence of man in that remote\r\nantiquity. But with regard to the earliest Root‐Races the case is very\r\ndifferent. If the thick agglomeration of vapours, charged with carbonic\r\nacid, that escaped from the soil, or was held in suspension in the\r\natmosphere since the commencement of sedimentation, offered a fatal\r\nobstacle to the life of human organisms as now known, how, it will be\r\nasked, could the primeval men have existed? This consideration is, in\r\nreality, out of court. Such terrestrial conditions as were then operative\r\nhad no touch with the plane on which the evolution of the _ethereal\r\nastral_ Races proceeded. Only in relatively recent geological periods, has\r\nthe spiral course of cyclic law swept mankind into the lowest grade of\r\nphysical evolution—the plane of gross material causation. In those early\r\nages, _astral_ evolution was alone in progress, and the two planes, the\r\nastral and the physical,(365) though developing on parallel lines, had no\r\ndirect point of contact with one another. It is obvious that a shadow‐like\r\n_ethereal_ man is related by virtue of his organization—if such it can be\r\ncalled—only to that plane from which the substance of his Upâdhi is\r\nderived.\r\n\r\nThere are things, perhaps, that may have escaped the far‐seeing—but not\r\n_all‐seeing_—eyes of our modern Naturalists; yet it is Nature herself who\r\nundertakes to furnish the missing links. Agnostic speculative thinkers\r\nhave to choose between the version given by the Secret Doctrine of the\r\nEast, and the hopelessly materialistic Darwinian and Biblical accounts of\r\nthe origin of man; between no soul and no spiritual evolution, and the\r\nOccult doctrine which repudiates “special creation” and the “Evolutionist”\r\nanthropogenesis equally.\r\n\r\nAgain, to take up the question of “spontaneous generation”; life—as\r\nScience shows—has not always reigned on this terrestrial plane. There was\r\na time when even the Hæckelian Moneron—that simple globule of\r\nProtoplasm—had not yet appeared at the bottom of the seas. Whence came the\r\n_Impulse_ which caused the molecules of Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, etc., to\r\ngroup themselves into the Urschleim of Oken, that organic “Slime,” now\r\nchristened Protoplasm? What were the prototypes of the Monera? They, at\r\nleast, could not have fallen in meteorites from other Globes already\r\nformed, Sir William Thomson’s wild theory to this effect notwithstanding.\r\nAnd even if they had so fallen; if our Earth got its supply of life‐germs\r\nfrom other Planets; who, or _what_, had carried them on to these Planets?\r\nHere, again, unless the Occult Teaching is accepted, we are compelled once\r\nmore to face a _miracle_—to accept the theory of a personal,\r\nanthropomorphic Creator, the attributes and definitions of whom, as\r\nformulated by the Monotheists, clash as much with philosophy and logic, as\r\nthey degrade the ideal of an infinite Universal Deity, before whose\r\nincomprehensible awful grandeur the highest human intellect feels dwarfed.\r\nLet not the modern Philosopher, while arbitrarily placing himself on the\r\nhighest pinnacle of human intellectuality hitherto evolved, show himself\r\nspiritually and intuitionally so far below the conceptions of even the\r\nancient Greeks, themselves on a far lower level, in these respects, than\r\nthe Philosophers of Eastern Âryan antiquity. Hylozoism, when\r\nphilosophically understood, is the highest aspect of Pantheism. It is the\r\nonly possible escape from idiotic Atheism based on lethal materiality, and\r\nthe still more idiotic anthropomorphic conceptions of the Monotheists;\r\nbetween which it stands on its own entirely neutral ground. Hylozoism\r\n_demands_ absolute Divine Thought, which would _pervade_ the numberless\r\nactive, creating Forces, or “Creators,” which _Entities_ are moved by, and\r\nhave their being in, from, and through, that Divine Thought; the latter,\r\nnevertheless, having no more personal concern in them or _their_\r\ncreations, than the Sun has in the sun‐flower and its seeds, or in\r\nvegetation in general. Such active “Creators” are known to exist and are\r\nbelieved in, because perceived and sensed by the _Inner_ Man in the\r\nOccultist. Thus the latter says that an Absolute Deity, having to be\r\nunconditioned and unrelated, cannot be thought of at the same time as an\r\nactive, creating, one living God, without immediate degradation of the\r\nideal.(366) A Deity that manifests in Space and Time—these two being\r\nsimply the forms of THAT which is the Absolute ALL—can be but a fractional\r\npart of the whole. And since that “All” cannot be divided in its\r\nabsoluteness, therefore that _sensed_ Creator (we say Creators) can be at\r\nbest but the mere _aspect_ thereof. To use the same metaphor—inadequate to\r\nexpress the full idea, yet well adapted to the case in hand—these Creators\r\nare like the numerous rays of the solar orb, which remains unconscious of,\r\nand unconcerned in, the work; while its mediating agents, the rays, become\r\nthe instrumental media every spring—the Manvantaric dawn of the Earth—in\r\nfructifying and awakening the dormant vitality inherent in Nature and its\r\ndifferentiated matter. This was so well understood in antiquity, that even\r\nthe moderately religious Aristotle remarked that such work of direct\r\ncreation would be quite unbecoming to God—ἀπρεπὲς τῷ Θεῷ. Plato and other\r\nphilosophers taught the same: deity cannot set its own hand to\r\ncreation—αὐτουργεῖν ἅπαντα. This Cudworth calls “Hylozoism.” As old Zeno\r\nis credited by Laërtius with having said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Nature is a habit moved from itself, according to seminal\r\n    principles; perfecting and containing those several things which\r\n    in determinate times are produced from it, and acting agreeably to\r\n    that from which it was secreted.(367)\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us return to our subject, pausing to think over it. Indeed, if there\r\nwas vegetable life during those periods that could feed on the then\r\ndeleterious elements; and if there was even animal life whose aquatic\r\norganization could be developed, notwithstanding the supposed scarcity of\r\nOxygen, why could there not be human life also, in its incipient physical\r\nform, _i.e._, in a race of beings adapted for that geological period and\r\nits surroundings? Besides, Science confesses that it knows nothing of the\r\nreal length of geological periods.\r\n\r\nBut the chief question before us is, whether it is quite certain that,\r\nfrom the time of that which is called the Azoic Age, there ever was such\r\nan atmosphere as that hypothesized by the Naturalists. Not all the\r\nPhysicists agree with this idea. Were the writer anxious to corroborate\r\nthe teachings of the Secret Doctrine by exact Science, it would be easy to\r\nshow, on the admission of more than one Physicist, that the atmosphere has\r\nchanged little, if at all, since the first condensation of the\r\noceans—_i.e._, since the Laurentian Period, the Pyrolithic Age. Such, at\r\nany rate, is the opinion of Blanchard, S. Meunier, and even of Bischof—as\r\nthe experiments of the last Scientist with basalts have shown. For were we\r\nto take the word of the majority of Scientists as to the quantity of\r\ndeadly gases, and of elements entirely saturated with Carbon and Nitrogen,\r\nin which the vegetable and animal kingdoms are shown to have lived,\r\nthriven, and developed, then one would have to come to the curious\r\nconclusion that there were, in those days, oceans of _liquid carbonic\r\nacid_, instead of water. With such an element, it becomes doubtful whether\r\nthe Ganoids, or even the Primitive Trilobites themselves could live in the\r\noceans of the Primary Age—let alone in those of the Silurian, as shown by\r\nBlanchard.\r\n\r\nThe conditions that were necessary for the earliest Race of mankind,\r\nhowever, require no elements, whether simple or compound. That which was\r\nstated at the beginning is maintained. The spiritual ethereal Entity which\r\nlived in Spaces unknown to Earth, before the first sidereal “jelly‐speck”\r\nevolved in the Ocean of crude Cosmic Matter—billions and trillions of\r\nyears before our globular speck in infinity, called Earth, came into being\r\nand generated the Monera in its drops, called oceans—needed no “elements.”\r\nThe “Manu with soft bones,” could well dispense with Calcium Phosphate, as\r\nhe had no bones, save in a figurative sense. And while even the Monera,\r\nhowever homogeneous their organism, still required physical conditions of\r\nlife that would help them toward further evolution, the Being which became\r\nPrimitive Man and the “Father of Man,” after evolving on planes of\r\nexistence undreamed of by Science, could well remain impervious to any\r\nstate of atmospheric conditions around him. The primitive ancestor, in\r\nBrasseur de Bourbourg’s _Popol Vuh_, who—in the Mexican legends—could act\r\nand live with equal ease under ground and water as upon the earth, answers\r\nonly to the Second and early Third Races in our texts. And if the three\r\nkingdoms of Nature were so different in pre‐diluvian ages, why should not\r\nman have been composed of materials and combinations of atoms now entirely\r\nunknown to Physical Science? The plants and animals now known, in almost\r\nnumberless varieties and species, have all developed, according to\r\nscientific hypotheses, from primitive and far fewer organic forms. Why\r\nshould not the same have occurred in the case of man, the elements, and\r\nthe rest? As the Commentary says:\r\n\r\n_Universal Genesis starts from the One, breaks into Three, then Five, and\r\nfinally culminates in Seven, to return into Four, Three, and One._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStanza VII. From The Semi‐Divine Down To The First Human Races.\r\n\r\n\r\n    24. The higher Creators reject in their pride the Forms evolved by\r\n    the “Sons of Yoga.” 25. They will not incarnate in the early Egg‐\r\n    born. 26. They select the later Androgynes. 27. The first man\r\n    endowed with mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n24. THE SONS OF WISDOM, THE SONS OF NIGHT,(368) READY FOR REBIRTH, CAME\r\nDOWN. THEY SAW THE VILE(369) FORMS OF THE FIRST THIRD(370) (_A_). “WE CAN\r\nCHOOSE,” SAID THE LORDS, “WE HAVE WISDOM.” SOME ENTERED THE CHHÂYÂS. SOME\r\nPROJECTED A SPARK. SOME DEFERRED TILL THE FOURTH.(371) FROM THEIR OWN RÛPA\r\nTHEY FILLED(372) THE KÂMA.(373) THOSE WHO ENTERED BECAME ARHATS. THOSE WHO\r\nRECEIVED BUT A SPARK, REMAINED DESTITUTE OF KNOWLEDGE;(374) THE SPARK\r\nBURNED LOW (_B_). THE THIRD REMAINED MIND‐LESS. THEIR JÎVAS(375) WERE NOT\r\nREADY. THESE WERE SET APART AMONG THE SEVEN.(376) THEY BECAME NARROW‐\r\nHEADED. THE THIRD WERE READY. “IN THESE SHALL WE DWELL,” SAID THE LORDS OF\r\nTHE FLAME AND OF THE DARK WISDOM (_C_).\r\n\r\nThis Stanza contains, in itself, the whole key to the mysteries of evil,\r\nthe so‐called Fall of the Angels, and the many problems that have puzzled\r\nthe brains of the Philosophers from the time that the memory of man began.\r\nIt solves the secret of the subsequent inequalities or intellectual\r\ncapacity, of birth or social position, and gives a logical explanation to\r\nthe incomprehensible Karmic course throughout the æons which followed. The\r\nbest explanation which can be given, in view of the difficulties of the\r\nsubject, will now be attempted.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Up to the Fourth Round, and even to the later part of the Third Race\r\nin this Round, _Man_—if the ever‐changing forms that clothed the Monads\r\nduring the first three Rounds and the first two and a half Races of the\r\npresent Round can be given that misleading name—is, so far, only an animal\r\nintellectually. It is only in the present _midway_ Round that he entirely\r\ndevelops in himself the Fourth Principle as a fit vehicle for the Fifth.\r\nBut Manas will be relatively _fully_ developed only in the following\r\nRound, when it will have an opportunity of becoming entirely divine until\r\nthe end of the Rounds. As Christian Schœttgen says in _Horæ Hebraicæ_,\r\netc., the first terrestrial Adam “had only the breath of life,”—Nephesh,\r\n_but not the living Soul_.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Here the inferior Races, of which there are still some analogues\r\nleft—as the Australians, now fast dying out, and some African and Oceanic\r\ntribes—are meant. “They were not ready” signifies that the Karmic\r\ndevelopment of these Monads had not yet fitted them to occupy the forms of\r\nmen destined for incarnation in higher intellectual Races. But this is\r\nexplained later on.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The _Zohar_ speaks of “Black Fire,” which is Absolute Light—Wisdom.\r\nTo those who, prompted by old theological prejudice, may say: But the\r\nAsuras are the rebel Devas, the opponents of the Gods—hence Devils, and\r\nthe Spirits of Evil—it is answered: Esoteric Philosophy admits neither\r\ngood nor evil _per se_, as existing independently in Nature. The cause for\r\nboth is found, as regards the Kosmos, in the necessity of contraries or\r\ncontrasts, and with respect to man, in his human nature, his ignorance and\r\npassions. There are no Devils or the utterly depraved, as there are no\r\nAngels absolutely perfect, though there may be Spirits of Light and of\r\nDarkness; thus Lucifer—the Spirit of Intellectual Enlightenment and\r\nFreedom of Thought—is metaphorically the guiding beacon, which helps man\r\nto find his way through the rocks and sand‐banks of Life, for Lucifer is\r\nthe Logos in his highest, and the “Adversary” in his lowest aspect—both of\r\nwhich are reflected in our Ego. Lactantius, speaking of the Nature of\r\nChrist, makes the Logos, the Word, “the _first‐born brother of Satan_, and\r\n_the first of all creatures_.”(377)\r\n\r\nThe _Vishnu Purâna_ describes these primeval creatures (Tiryaksrotas) with\r\n_crooked_ digestive canals:\r\n\r\n\r\n    [They were] endowed with inward manifestations, but mutually in\r\n    ignorance _about their kind and nature_.(378)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe twenty‐eight kinds of Badhas, or “imperfections,” do not apply, as\r\nWilson thought, to the animals now known, which are specified by him, for\r\nthey did not exist in those geological periods. This is quite plain from\r\nthe said work, in which the first created are the “five‐fold (immovable)\r\nworld,” minerals and vegetables; then come those fabulous animals,\r\nTiryaksrotas—the monsters of the Abyss, slain by the “Lords,” of Stanzas\r\nII and III; then the Ûrdhvasrotas, the happy celestial beings, which feed\r\non ambrosia; and lastly, the Arvâksrotas, human beings—Brahmâ’s seventh\r\n“creation” so‐called. But these “creations,” including the latter, did not\r\noccur on this Globe, wherever else they may have taken place. It is not\r\nBrahmâ who creates things and men on this Earth, but the Chief and Lord of\r\nthe Prajâpatis, the Lords of Being and terrestrial Creation. “Obeying the\r\ncommand of Brahmâ,” Daksha—the synthesis, or the aggregate, of the\r\nTerrestrial Creators and Progenitors, the Pitris included—made superior\r\nand inferior (vara and avara) things, “referring to putra” progeny, and\r\n“_bipeds_ and _quadrupeds_, and subsequently, by his will [referring to\r\nthe Sons of Will and Yoga], gave birth to females”(379)—_i.e._, separated\r\nthe androgynes. Here, again, we have “bipeds” or men, created before the\r\n“quadrupeds” as in the Esoteric Teachings.\r\n\r\nSince, in the exoteric accounts, the Asuras are the first Beings created\r\nfrom the “Body of Night,” while the Pitris issue from that of “Twilight”;\r\nthe “Gods” being placed by Parâshara, in the _Vishnu Purâna_, between the\r\ntwo, and shown to evolve from the “Body of the Day,” it is easy to\r\ndiscover a determined purpose to veil the order of creation. Man is the\r\nArvâksrota coming from the “Body of the Dawn”; and elsewhere, man is again\r\nreferred to, when the Creator of the World, Brahmâ, is shown “creating\r\nfierce beings, who were denominated Bhûtas, and eaters of flesh,” or as\r\nthe text has it, “fiends, frightful from being monkey‐coloured and\r\ncarnivorous.”(380) Whereas the Râkshasas are generally translated by “evil\r\nSpirits” and “enemies of the Gods,” which identifies them with the Asuras.\r\nIn the _Râmâyana_, when Hanumân is reconnoitering the enemy in Lankâ, he\r\nfinds there Râkshasas, some hideous, “while some were beautiful to look\r\nupon,” and, in the _Vishnu Purâna_, there is a direct reference to their\r\nbecoming the Saviours of “Humanity,” or of Brahmâ.\r\n\r\nThe allegory is very ingenious. Great intellect and too much knowledge are\r\na two‐edged weapon in life, and instruments for evil as well as for good.\r\nWhen combined with selfishness, they will make of the whole of Humanity a\r\nfootstool for the elevation of him who possesses them, and a means for the\r\nattainment of his objects; while, applied to altruistic humanitarian\r\npurposes, they may become the means of the salvation of many. At all\r\nevents, the absence of self‐consciousness and intellect will make of man\r\nan idiot, a brute in human form. Brahmâ is Mahat, the Universal Mind;\r\nhence the too selfish among the Râkshasas showing the desire to become\r\npossessed of it all—to “devour” Mahat. The allegory is transparent.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, Esoteric Philosophy identifies the pre‐Brâhmanical Asuras,\r\nRudras,(381) Râkshasas and all the “Adversaries” of the Gods in the\r\nallegories, with the Egos, which, by incarnating in the still witless man\r\nof the Third Race, made him _consciously_ immortal. They are, then, during\r\nthe cycle of Incarnations, the true _dual_ Logos—the conflicting and two‐\r\nfaced Divine Principle in Man. The Commentary that follows, and the next\r\nStanzas may, no doubt, throw more light on this very difficult tenet, but\r\nthe writer does not feel competent to give it out fully. Of the succession\r\nof Races, however, the Commentary says:\r\n\r\n_First come the __SELF‐EXISTENT__ on this Earth. They are the\r\n__“__Spiritual Lives__”__ projected by the absolute __WILL__ and __LAW__,\r\nat the Dawn of every Rebirth of the Worlds. These Lives are the divine\r\n__“__Shishta__”__ [the Seed‐Manus, or the Prajâpatis and the Pitris]._\r\n\r\nFrom these proceed:\r\n\r\n1. _The First Race, the __“__Self‐born,__”__ which are the [Astral]\r\nShadows of their Progenitors. The Body was devoid of all understanding\r\n[mind, intelligence, and will]. The Inner Being [the Higher Self, or\r\nMonad], though within the earthly frame, was unconnected with it. The\r\nlink, the Manas, was not there as yet._\r\n\r\n2. _From the First [Race] emanated the Second, called the __“__Sweat‐\r\nborn__”_(_382_)_ and the __“__Boneless.__”__ This is the Second Root‐Race,\r\nendowed by the Preservers [Râkshasas]_(_383_)_ and the Incarnating Gods\r\n[the Asuras and Kumâras] with the first primitive and weak Spark [the germ\r\nof intelligence]...._\r\n\r\nAnd from these in turn proceeds:\r\n\r\n3. _The Third Root‐Race, the __“__Two‐fold__”__ [Androgynes]. The first\r\nRaces thereof are Shells, till the last is __“__inhabited__”__ [i.e.,\r\ninformed] by the Dhyânîs._\r\n\r\nThe Second Race, as stated above, being also sexless, evolved out of\r\nitself, at its beginning, the Third, Androgyne Race by an analogous, but\r\nalready more complicated process. As described in the Commentary, the very\r\nearliest of that Race were:\r\n\r\n_The __“__Sons of Passive Yoga.__”_(_384_)_ They issued from the Second\r\nManushyas [Human Race], and became oviparous. The emanations that came out\r\nof their bodies during the seasons of procreation were ovulary; the small\r\nspheroidal nuclei developing into a large soft, egg‐like vehicle,\r\ngradually hardened, when, after a period of gestation, it broke and the\r\nyoung human animal issued from it unaided, as the fowls do in our Race._\r\n\r\nThis must seem to the reader ludicrously absurd. Nevertheless, it is\r\nstrictly on the lines of evolutionary analogy, which Science perceives in\r\nthe development of the living animal species. First the moneron‐like\r\nprocreation by “self‐division”; then, after a few stages, the oviparous,\r\nas in the case of the reptiles, which are followed by the birds; then,\r\nfinally, the mammals with their ovoviviparous modes of producing their\r\nyoung ones.\r\n\r\nIf the term “ovoviviparous” is applied to some fish and reptiles, which\r\nhatch their eggs within their bodies, why should it not be applied to\r\nfemale mammalians, including woman? The ovule, in which, after\r\nimpregnation, the development of the fœtus takes place, is an egg.\r\n\r\nAt all events, this conception is more philosophical than that of Eve with\r\na suddenly created placenta giving birth to Cain, because of the “apple,”\r\nwhen even the marsupial, the earliest of mammals, is not placental yet.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the progressive order of the methods of reproduction, as\r\nunveiled by Science, is a brilliant confirmation of Esoteric Ethnology, It\r\nis only necessary to tabulate the data in order to prove our\r\nassertion.(385)\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Fission.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) As seen in the division of the homogeneous speck of Protoplasm,\r\nknown as Moneron or Amœba, into two.\r\n\r\n(_b_) As seen in the division of the nucleated cell, in which the cell‐\r\nnucleus splits into two sub‐nuclei, which either develop within the\r\noriginal cell‐wall or burst it, and multiply outside as independent\r\nentities. (_Cf._ the First Root‐Race.)\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Budding.\r\n\r\n\r\nA small portion of the parent structure swells out at the surface and\r\nfinally parts company, growing to the size of the original organism;\r\n_e.g._, many vegetables, the sea‐anemone, etc. (_Cf._ the Second Root‐\r\nRace.)(386)\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Spores.\r\n\r\n\r\nA single cell thrown off by the parent organism, which develops into a\r\nmulticellular organism reproducing the features of the latter, _e.g._,\r\nBacteria and mosses.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Intermediate Hermaphroditism.\r\n\r\n\r\nMale and female organs inhering in the same individual; _e.g._, the\r\nmajority of plants, worms, and snails, etc.; allied to budding. (_Cf._\r\nSecond and early Third Root‐Races.)\r\n\r\n\r\nV. True Sexual Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_Cf._ later Third Root‐Race.)\r\n\r\nWe now come to an important point with regard to the double evolution of\r\nthe human race. The Sons of Wisdom, or the _Spiritual_, Dhyânîs had become\r\n“intellectual” through their contact with Matter, because they had already\r\nreached, during previous cycles of incarnation, that degree of intellect\r\nwhich enabled them to become independent and self‐conscious entities, _on\r\nthis plane_ of Matter. They were reborn only by reason of Karmic effects.\r\nThey _entered_ those who were “ready,” and became the Arhats, or Sages,\r\nalluded to above. This needs explanation.\r\n\r\nIt does not mean that Monads entered Forms in which other Monads already\r\nwere. They were “Essences,” “Intelligences,” and Conscious Spirits;\r\nEntities seeking to become still more conscious by uniting with more\r\ndeveloped Matter. Their essence was too pure to be distinct from the\r\nUniversal Essence; but their “Egos,” or Manas (since they are called\r\nMânasaputra, born of Mahat, or Brahmâ) had to pass through earthly human\r\nexperiences to become _all‐wise_, and be able to start on the returning\r\nascending cycle. The Monads are not _discrete_ principles, limited or\r\nconditioned, but rays from that one universal _absolute_ Principle. The\r\nentrance of one ray of sunlight following another through the same\r\naperture into a dark room will not constitute _two_ rays, but one ray\r\nintensified. It is not in the course of natural law that man should become\r\na _perfect_ Septenary Being before the Seventh Race in the Seventh Round.\r\nYet he has all these principles latent in him from his birth. Nor is it\r\npart of the evolutionary law that the Fifth Principle (Manas), should\r\nreceive its complete development before the Fifth Round. All such\r\nprematurely developed intellects (on the _spiritual_ plane) in our Race\r\nare _abnormal_; they are those whom we have called the “Fifth‐Rounders.”\r\nEven in the coming Seventh Race, at the close of this Fourth Round, while\r\nour four lower principles will be fully developed, that of Manas will be\r\nonly proportionately so. This limitation, however, refers solely to the\r\nspiritual development. The intellectual, on the physical plane, was\r\nreached during the Fourth Root‐Race. Thus, those who were “half ready,”\r\nwho received “but a spark,” constitute the average humanity which have to\r\nacquire their intellectuality during the present Manvantaric evolution,\r\nafter which they will be ready in the next for the full reception of the\r\n“Sons of Wisdom.” While those which “were not ready” at all, the latest\r\nMonads, which had hardly evolved from their last transitional and lower\r\nanimal forms at the close of the Third Round, remained the “narrow‐\r\nbrained” of the Stanza. This explains the otherwise unaccountable degrees\r\nof intellectuality among the various races of men—the savage Bushman and\r\nthe European—even now. Those tribes of savages, whose reasoning powers are\r\nvery little above the level of the animals, are not the unjustly\r\ndisinherited, or the “unfavoured,” as some may think—nothing of the kind.\r\nThey are simply those _latest arrivals_ among the human Monads, which\r\n“were not ready”; which have to evolve during the present Round, as also\r\non the three remaining Globes—hence on four different planes of being—so\r\nas to arrive at the level of the average class when they reach the Fifth\r\nRound. One remark may prove useful, as food for thought to the student in\r\nthis connection. The Monads of the lowest specimens of humanity—the\r\n“narrow‐brained”(387) savage South‐Sea Islander, the African, the\r\nAustralian—_had no Karma to work out when first born as men, as their more\r\nfavoured brethren in intelligence had_. The former are spinning out Karma\r\nonly now; the latter are burdened with past, present and future Karma. In\r\nthis respect the poor savage is more fortunate than the greatest genius of\r\n_civilized countries_.\r\n\r\nLet us pause before giving any more such strange teachings. Let us try and\r\nfind out how far any ancient Scriptures, and even Science, permit the\r\npossibility of, or even distinctly corroborate, such wild notions as are\r\nfound in our Anthropogenesis.\r\n\r\nRecapitulating that which has been said, we find that the Secret Doctrine\r\nclaims for man: (1) a polygenetic origin; (2) a variety of modes of\r\nprocreation before humanity fell into the ordinary method of generation;\r\n(3) that the evolution of animals—of the mammalians at any rate—follows\r\nthat of man instead of preceding it. And this is diametrically opposed to\r\nthe now generally accepted theories of evolution and the descent of man\r\nfrom an animal ancestor.\r\n\r\nLet us, giving to Cæsar what is Cæsar’s, examine, first of all, the\r\nchances for the polygenetic theory among the men of Science.\r\n\r\nNow the majority of the Darwinian Evolutionists incline to a polygenetic\r\nexplanation of the origin of races. On this particular question, however,\r\nas in many other cases, Scientists are at sixes and sevens; they agree to\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Does man descend from one _single couple_ or from _several\r\n    groups_—monogenism or polygenism? As far as one can venture to\r\n    pronounce on what in the absence of witnesses [?] will never be\r\n    known [?], the second hypothesis is far the most probable.(388)\r\n\r\n\r\nAbel Hovelacque, in his _Science of Language_, comes to a similar\r\nconclusion, arguing from the evidence available to a linguistic enquirer.\r\n\r\nIn an address delivered before the British Association, Professor W. H.\r\nFlower remarked on this question:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The view which appears best to accord with what is now known of\r\n    the characters and distribution of the races of man ... is a\r\n    modification of the monogenistic hypothesis[!]. Without entering\r\n    into the difficult question of the method of man’s first\r\n    appearance upon the world, we must assume for it a vast antiquity,\r\n    at all events as measured by any historical standard. _If we had\r\n    any approach to a complete palæontological record, the history of\r\n    man could be re‐constructed, but nothing of the kind is\r\n    forthcoming._\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch an admission must be regarded as fatal to the dogmatism of the\r\nPhysical Evolutionists, and as opening a wide margin to Occult\r\nspeculations. The opponents of the Darwinian theory were, and still\r\nremain, polygenists. Such “intellectual giants” as John Crawford and James\r\nHunt discussed the problem and favoured polygenesis, and in their day\r\nthere was a far stronger feeling in favour of than against this theory. It\r\nwas only in 1864 that Darwinians began to be wedded to the theory of\r\nunity, of which Messrs. Huxley and Lubbock became the first coryphæi.\r\n\r\nAs regards the other question, of the priority of man to the animals in\r\nthe order of evolution, the answer is as promptly given. If man is really\r\nthe Microcosm of the Macrocosm, then the teaching has nothing so very\r\nimpossible in it, and is but logical. For, man becomes that Macrocosm for\r\nthe three lower kingdoms under him. Arguing from a physical standpoint,\r\nall the lower kingdoms, save the mineral—which is light itself,\r\ncrystallized and immetallized—from plants to the creatures which preceded\r\nthe first mammalians, all have been consolidated in their physical\r\nstructures by means of the “cast‐off dust” of those minerals, and _the\r\nrefuse of the human matter, whether from living or dead bodies, on which\r\nthey fed and which gave them their outer bodies_. In his turn also, man\r\ngrew more physical, by reäbsorbing into his system that which he had given\r\nout, and which became transformed in the living animal crucibles through\r\nwhich it had passed, owing to Nature’s alchemical transmutations. There\r\nwere animals in those days of which our Modern Naturalists have never\r\ndreamed; and the stronger became physical material man—the giants of those\r\ntimes—the more powerful were his emanations. Once that Androgyne Humanity\r\nseparated into sexes, transformed by Nature into child‐bearing engines, it\r\nceased to procreate its like through drops of vital energy oozing out of\r\nthe body. But while man was still ignorant of his procreative powers on\r\nthe human plane—before his Fall, as a believer in Adam would say—all this\r\nvital energy, scattered far and wide from him, was used by Nature for the\r\nproduction of the first mammal‐animal forms. Evolution is _an eternal\r\ncycle of becoming_, we are taught; and Nature never leaves an atom unused.\r\nMoreover, from the beginning of the Round, all in Nature tends to become\r\nMan. All the impulses of the dual, centripetal and centrifugal Force are\r\ndirected towards one point—_Man_. The progress in the succession of\r\nbeings, says Agassiz:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Consists in an increasing similarity of the living fauna, and\r\n    among the vertebrates, especially, in the increasing resemblance\r\n    to man. Man is the end towards which all _animal_ creation has\r\n    tended from the first appearance of the first palæozoic\r\n    fishes.(389)\r\n\r\n\r\nJust so; but the “palæozoic fishes” are at the lower curve of the arc of\r\nthe evolution of _forms_, and this Round began with Astral Man, the\r\n_reflection_ of the Dhyân Chohans, called the “Builders.” Man is the\r\n_alpha and the omega_ of objective creation. As said in _Isis Unveiled_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    All things had their origin in Spirit—evolution having originally\r\n    begun from above and proceeding downwards, instead of the reverse,\r\n    as taught in the Darwinian theory.(390)\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, the tendency spoken of by the eminent Naturalist above quoted\r\nis one inherent in every atom. Only, were one to apply it to both sides of\r\nevolution, the observations made would greatly interfere with the modern\r\ntheory, which has now almost become (Darwinian) law.\r\n\r\nBut in citing the passage from Agassiz’ work with approval, it must not be\r\nunderstood that the Occultists are making any _concession_ to the theory\r\nwhich derives man from the animal kingdom. The fact that in this Round he\r\npreceded the mammalia is obviously not impugned by the consideration that\r\nthe latter follow in the wake of man.\r\n\r\n25. HOW DID THE MÂNASA, THE SONS OF WISDOM, ACT? THEY REJECTED THE SELF‐\r\nBORN.(391) THEY ARE NOT READY. THEY SPURNED THE SWEAT‐BORN.(392) THEY ARE\r\nNOT QUITE READY. THEY WOULD NOT ENTER THE FIRST EGG‐BORN.(393)\r\n\r\nTo a Theist or a Christian this verse would suggest a rather theological\r\nidea: that of the Fall of the Angels through Pride. In the Secret\r\nDoctrine, however, the reasons for the refusal to incarnate in _half‐\r\nready_ physical bodies seem to be more connected with physiological than\r\nmetaphysical reasons. Not all the organisms were sufficiently ready. The\r\nIncarnating Powers chose the ripest fruits and spurned the rest.\r\n\r\nBy a curious coincidence, when selecting a familiar name for the continent\r\non which the first Androgynes, the Third Root‐Race, separated, the writer\r\nchose, on geographical considerations, that of “Lemuria,” invented by Mr.\r\nP. L. Sclater. It was only later that, on reading Hæckel’s _Pedigree of\r\nMan_, it was found that the German “Animalist” had chosen the name for his\r\nlate continent. He traces, properly enough, the centre of human evolution\r\nto Lemuria, but with a slight scientific variation. Speaking of it as that\r\n“cradle of mankind,” he pictures the gradual transformation of the\r\nanthropoid mammal into the primeval savage!! Vogt, again, holds that in\r\nAmerica man sprang from a branch of the platyrrhine apes, _independently_\r\nof the origination of the African and Asian root‐stocks from the old world\r\ncatarrhinians. Anthropologists are, as usual, at loggerheads on this\r\nquestion, as on many others. We shall examine this claim in the light of\r\nEsoteric Philosophy in Stanza VIII. Meanwhile, let us give a few moments\r\nof attention to the various consecutive modes of procreation according to\r\nthe laws of Evolution.\r\n\r\nLet us begin by the mode of reproduction of the later sub‐races of the\r\nThird Human Race, by those who found themselves endowed with the “Sacred\r\nFire” from the Spark of higher and then independent Beings, who were the\r\npsychic and spiritual Parents of Man, as the lower Pitri Devatâs (the\r\nPitris) were the Progenitors of his physical body. That Third and holy\r\nRace consisted of men who, at their zenith, were described as “towering\r\ngiants of godly strength and beauty, and the depositories of all the\r\nmysteries of Heaven and Earth.” Have they likewise _fallen_, if, then,\r\nincarnation was the “Fall”?\r\n\r\nOf this presently. The only thing now to be noted of these is, that the\r\nchief Gods and Heroes of the Fourth and Fifth Races, as of later\r\nantiquity, are the _deified images of these Men of the Third_. The days of\r\ntheir physiological purity, and those of their so‐called Fall, have\r\nequally survived in the hearts and memories of their descendants. Hence,\r\nthe dual nature shown in these Gods, both virtue and sin being exalted to\r\ntheir highest degree, in the biographies composed by posterity. They were\r\nthe Pre‐Adamite and the Divine Races, with which even Theology, in whose\r\nsight they are all the “accursed Cainite races,” now begins to busy\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nBut the action of the “Spiritual Progenitors” of that Race has first to be\r\ndisposed of. A very difficult and abstruse point has to be explained with\r\nregard to Shlokas 26 and 27.\r\n\r\n26. WHEN THE SWEAT‐BORN PRODUCED THE EGG‐BORN, THE TWO‐FOLD,(394) THE\r\nMIGHTY, THE POWERFUL WITH BONES, THE LORDS OF WISDOM SAID: “NOW SHALL WE\r\nCREATE.”\r\n\r\nWhy “now”—and not earlier? This the following Shloka explains.\r\n\r\n27. THE THIRD RACE BECAME THE VÂHAN(395) OF THE LORDS OF WISDOM. IT\r\nCREATED SONS OF WILL AND YOGA, BY KRIYÂSHAKTI IT CREATED THEM, THE HOLY\r\nFATHERS, ANCESTORS OF THE ARHATS....\r\n\r\nHow did they “create,” since the “Lords of Wisdom” are identical with the\r\nHindû Devas, who refuse to “create”? Clearly they are the Kumâras of the\r\nHindû Pantheon and _Purânas_, those Elder Sons of Brahmâ:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Sanandana and the other sous of Vedhas [who], previously created\r\n    by him ... without desire or passion, [remained chaste] inspired\r\n    with holy wisdom ... and undesirous of progeny.(396)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe power, by which they first created, is that which has since caused\r\nthem to be degraded from their high status to the position of Evil\r\nSpirits, of Satan and his Host—created in their turn by the unclean fancy\r\nof exoteric creeds. It was by Kriyâshakti, that mysterious and divine\r\npower, latent in the _will_ of every man, which, if not called to life,\r\nquickened and developed by Yoga‐training, remains dormant in 999,999 men\r\nout of a million, and so gets atrophied. This power is explained in the\r\n“Twelve Signs of the Zodiac,”(397) as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Kriyâshakti_:—The mysterious _power of thought_ which enables it\r\n    to produce external, perceptible, phenomenal results by its own\r\n    inherent energy. The ancients held that any idea will manifest\r\n    itself _externally_, if one’s attention [and _will_] is deeply\r\n    concentrated upon it. Similarly, an intense volition will be\r\n    followed by the desired result.\r\n\r\n    A Yogî generally performs his wonders by means of Ichchhâshakti\r\n    (Will‐power) and Kriyâshakti.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Third Race had thus created the so‐called “Sons of Will and Yoga,” or\r\nthe “Ancestors”—the _Spiritual_ Forefathers—of all the subsequent and\r\npresent Arhats, or Mahâtmâs, in a truly _immaculate_ way. They were indeed\r\n_created_, not _begotten_, as were their brethren of the Fourth Race, who\r\nwere generated sexually after the separation of sexes, the “Fall of Man.”\r\nFor Creation is but the result of Will acting on phenomenal Matter, the\r\ncalling forth out of it the Primordial Divine Light and Eternal Life. They\r\nwere the “Holy Seed Grain” of the future Saviours of Humanity.\r\n\r\nHere we have to again make a break, in order to explain certain difficult\r\npoints, of which there are so many. It is almost impossible to avoid such\r\ninterruptions.(398)\r\n\r\nThe order of the evolution of the Human Races stands as follows in the\r\nFifth Book of the Commentaries, and has already been given:\r\n\r\n_The first men were Chhâyâs (1); the Second, the __“__Sweat‐born__”__ (2);\r\nthe Third, __“__Egg‐born,__”__ and the holy Fathers born by the power of\r\nKriyâshakti (3); the Fourth were the children of the Padmapâni [Chenresi]\r\n(4)._\r\n\r\nOf course such primeval modes of procreation—by the evolution of one’s\r\nimage; through drops of perspiration; after that by Yoga; and then by what\r\npeople will regard as magic (Kriyâshakti)—are doomed beforehand to be\r\nregarded as fairy‐tales. Nevertheless, beginning with the first and ending\r\nwith the last, there is really nothing miraculous in them, nor anything\r\nwhich may not be shown to be natural. This must be proven.\r\n\r\n1. Chhâyâ‐birth, or that primeval mode of _sexless_ procreation—the First\r\nRace having _oozed out_, so to say, from the bodies of the Pitris—is\r\nhinted at in a cosmic allegory in the _Purânas_.(399) It is the beautiful\r\nallegory and story of Sanjñâ, the daughter of Vishvakarman—married to the\r\nSun, who, “unable to endure the fervours of her Lord,” gave him her Chhâyâ\r\n(shadow, image, or astral body), while she herself repaired to the jungle\r\nto perform religious devotions, or Tapas. The Sun, supposing the Chhâyâ to\r\nbe his wife, begat by her children, like Adam with Lilith—an _ethereal\r\nshadow_ also, as in the legend, though an actual living female monster\r\nmillions of years ago.\r\n\r\nBut, perhaps, this instance proves little except the exuberant fancy of\r\nthe Paurânic authors. We have another proof ready. If the materialized\r\nforms, which are sometimes seen oozing out of the bodies of certain\r\nmediums could, instead of vanishing, be fixed and made solid—the\r\n“creation” of the First Race would become quite comprehensible. This kind\r\nof procreation cannot fail to be suggestive to the student. Neither the\r\nmystery nor the impossibility of such a mode is certainly any\r\ngreater—while it is far more comprehensible to the mind of the true\r\nmetaphysical thinker—than the mystery of the conception of the fœtus, its\r\ngestation and birth as a child, as we now know it.\r\n\r\nNow to the curious and little understood corroboration in the _Purânas_\r\nabout the “Sweat‐born.”\r\n\r\n2. Kandu is a sage and a Yogî, eminent in holy wisdom and pious\r\nausterities, which, finally, awaken the jealousy of the Gods, who are\r\nrepresented in the Hindû Scriptures as being in never‐ending strife with\r\nthe Ascetics. Indra, the “King of the Gods,”(400) finally sends one of his\r\nfemale Apsarases to tempt the sage. This is no worse than Jehovah sending\r\nSarah, Abraham’s wife, to tempt Pharaoh; but in truth it is these Gods\r\n(and God), who are ever trying to disturb Ascetics and thus make them lose\r\nthe fruit of their austerities, who ought to be regarded as “tempting\r\ndemons,” instead of applying the term to the Rudras, Kumâras, and Asuras,\r\nwhose great sanctity and chastity seem a standing reproach to the Don\r\nJuanic Gods of the Pantheon. But it is the reverse that we find in all the\r\nPaurânic allegories, and not without good esoteric reason.\r\n\r\nThe King of the Gods, or Indra, sends a beautiful Apsaras (nymph) named\r\nPramlochâ to seduce Kandu and disturb his penance. She succeeds in her\r\nunholy purpose and “nine hundred and seven years six months and three\r\ndays”(401) spent in her company seem to the Sage as one day. When this\r\npsychological or hypnotic state ends, the Muni bitterly curses the\r\ncreature who has seduced him, thus disturbing his devotions. “Depart,\r\nbegone!” he cries, “vile bundle of delusions!” And Pramlochâ, terrified,\r\nflies away, _wiping the perspiration __ from her body_ with the leaves of\r\nthe trees as she passes through the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The nymph went from tree to tree, and, as, with the dusky shoots\r\n    that crowned their summits, she dried her limbs, the child she had\r\n    conceived by the Rishi came forth from the pores of her skin in\r\n    drops of perspiration. The trees received the living dews; and the\r\n    winds collected them into one mass. “This,” said Soma [the Moon],\r\n    “I matured by my rays; and gradually it increased in size, till\r\n    the exhalation that had rested on the tree tops became the lovely\r\n    girl named Mârishâ.”(402)\r\n\r\n\r\nNow Kandu stands for the First Race. He is a son of the Pitris, hence one\r\n“devoid of mind,” a fact hinted at by his being unable to discern a period\r\nof nearly one thousand years from one day; therefore he is shown to be so\r\neasily deluded and blinded. Here is a variant of the allegory in\r\n_Genesis_, of Adam, born an image of clay, into which the “Lord God”\r\nbreathes the “breath of life” but not of intellect and discrimination,\r\nwhich are developed only after he had tasted of the fruit of the Tree of\r\nKnowledge; in other words when he has acquired the first development of\r\nMind, and had implanted in him Manas, whose terrestrial aspect is of the\r\nearth earthy, though its highest faculties connect it with Spirit and the\r\nDivine Soul. Pramlochâ is the Hindû Lilith of the Âryan Adam; and Mârishâ,\r\nthe daughter born of the perspiration from her pores, is the “Sweat‐born,”\r\nand stands as a symbol for the Second Race of mankind.\r\n\r\nIt is not Indra, who in this case figures in the _Purânas_, but Kâmadeva,\r\nthe God of love and desire, who sends Pramlochâ on Earth. Logic, as well\r\nas the Esoteric Doctrine, shows that it must be so. For Kâma is the king\r\nand lord of the Apsarases, of whom Pramlochâ is one; and, therefore, when\r\nKandu, cursing her, exclaims: “Thou hast performed the office assigned by\r\nthe monarch of the gods, go!”—he must mean by that monarch Kâma, and not\r\nIndra, to whom the Apsarases are not subservient. For Kâma, again, is in\r\nthe _Rig Veda_(403) the personification of that feeling which leads and\r\npropels to creation. He was the _First Movement_ that stirred the ONE,\r\nafter its manifestation from the purely Abstract Principle, to create.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Desire first arose in IT, which was the Primal Germ of Mind; and\r\n    which Sages, searching with their intellect, have discovered to be\r\n    the bond which connects Entity with Non‐Entity.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Hymn in the _Atharva Veda_ exalts Kâma into a supreme God and Creator,\r\nand says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Kâma was born the first. Him, neither Gods nor Fathers [Pitris]\r\n    nor Men have equalled.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Atharva Veda_ identifies him with Agni, but makes him superior to\r\nthat God. The _Taittirîya Brâhmana_ makes him allegorically the son of\r\nDharma (moral religious duty, piety and justice) and of Shraddhâ (faith).\r\nElsewhere Kâma is born from the heart of Brahmâ; therefore he is Âtmabhû\r\n“Self‐Existent,” and Aja, the “Unborn.” His sending Pramlochâ has a deep\r\nphilosophical meaning; sent by Indra—the narrative has none. As Erôs was\r\nconnected in early Greek mythology with the world’s creation, and only\r\nafterwards became the sexual Cupid, so was Kâma in his original Vedic\r\ncharacter; the _Harivamsha_ making him a son of Lakshmî, who is Venus. The\r\nallegory, as said, shows the psychic element developing the physiological,\r\nbefore the birth of Daksha—_the progenitor of real physical men_—who is\r\nmade to be born from Mârishâ and before whose time living beings and men\r\nwere procreated “by the will, by sight, by touch, and by yoga,” as will be\r\nshown.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the allegory on the mode of procreation of the Second or\r\nthe “Sweat‐born.” The same for the Third Race in its final development.\r\n\r\nMârishâ, through the exertions of Soma, the Moon, is taken to wife by the\r\nPrachetases, the production of the “Mind‐born” sons of Brahmâ also,(404)\r\nfrom whom they beget the Patriarch Daksha—a son of Brahmâ also in a former\r\nKalpa or life, explain and add the _Purânas_, in order to mislead, yet\r\nspeaking the truth.\r\n\r\n3. The early Third Race, then, is formed from drops of “Sweat,” which,\r\nafter many a transformation, grow into human bodies. This is not more\r\ndifficult to imagine or realize than the growth of the fœtus from an\r\nimperceptible germ, and its subsequent development into a child, and then\r\ninto a strong, heavy man. But the Third Race changes yet again its mode of\r\nprocreation according to the Commentaries. It is said to have emanated a\r\n_vis formativa_, which changed the drops of perspiration into greater\r\ndrops, which grew, expanded, and became ovoid bodies—huge eggs. In these\r\nthe human fœtus gestated for several years. In the _Purânas_, Mârishâ, the\r\ndaughter of Kandu, the sage, becomes the wife of the Prachetases, and the\r\nmother of Daksha. Now Daksha is the father of the first _human‐like_\r\nProgenitors, having been born in this way. He is mentioned later on. The\r\nevolution of man, the microcosm, is analogous to that of the universe, the\r\nmacrocosm. His evolution stands between that of the latter and that of the\r\nanimal, for which man, in his turn, is a macrocosm.\r\n\r\nThen the Third Race becomes:\r\n\r\n4. The Androgyne, or Hermaphrodite. This process of men‐bearing explains,\r\nperhaps, why Aristophanes, in Plato’s _Banquet_, describes the nature of\r\nthe old race as “androgynous,” the form of every individual being rounded,\r\n“having the back and sides as _in a circle_,” whose “manner of running was\r\ncircular ... terrible in force and strength and with prodigious ambition.”\r\nTherefore, to make them weaker, “Zeus divided them [in the Third Root‐\r\nRace] into two, and Apollo [the Sun], under his direction, closed up the\r\nskin.”\r\n\r\nThe Madagascans—the island belonged to Lemuria—have a tradition about the\r\nfirst man. He lived at first without eating, and, having indulged in food,\r\na swelling appeared in his leg; this bursting, there emerged from it a\r\nfemale, who became the mother of their race. Truly, “we have our sciences\r\nof Heterogenesis and Parthenogenesis, showing that the field is yet\r\nopen.... The polyps ... produce their offspring from themselves, like the\r\nbuds and ramifications of a tree....” Why not the primitive _human_ polyp?\r\nThe very interesting polyp Stauridium passes alternately from gemmation\r\ninto the sex method of reproduction. Curiously enough, though it grows\r\nmerely as a polyp on a stalk, it produces gemmules, which ultimately\r\ndevelop into a sea‐nettle or Medusa. The Medusa is utterly dissimilar to\r\nits parent‐organism, the Stauridium. It also reproduces itself\r\ndifferently, by sexual method, and from the resulting eggs Stauridia once\r\nmore put in an appearance. This striking fact may assist many to\r\nunderstand that a form may be evolved—as in the _sexual_ Lemurians from\r\n_hermaphrodite_ parentage—quite unlike its immediate progenitors. It is,\r\nmoreover, unquestionable that in the case of _human_ incarnations the law\r\nof Karma, racial or individual, overrides the subordinate tendencies of\r\nHeredity, its servant.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of the last sentence in the above‐quoted Commentary on Shloka\r\n27, namely, that the Fourth Race were the children of Padmapâni, may find\r\nits explanation in a certain letter from the Inspirer of _Esoteric\r\nBuddhism_:\r\n\r\n_The majority of mankind belongs to the seventh sub‐race of the Fourth\r\nRoot‐Race—the above‐mentioned Chinamen and their off‐shoots and branchlets\r\n(Malayans, Mongolians, Tibetans, Hungarians, Finns, and even the Esquimaux\r\nare all remnants of this last offshoot)._\r\n\r\nPadmapâni or Avalokiteshvara, in Sanskrit, is, in Tibetan, Chenresi. Now,\r\nAvalokiteshvara is the great Logos in its higher aspect and in the divine\r\nregions. But in the manifested planes, he is, like Daksha, the Progenitor\r\n(in a spiritual sense) of men. Padmapâni‐Avalokiteshvara is called\r\n_esoterically_ Bodhisattva (or Dhyân Chohan) Chenresi Vanchug, “the\r\npowerful and all‐seeing.” He is considered now as the greatest protector\r\nof Asia in general, and of Tibet in particular. In order to guide the\r\nTibetans and Lamas in holiness, and preserve the great Arhats in the\r\nworld, this heavenly Being is credited with manifesting himself from age\r\nto age in human form. A popular legend has it that whenever faith begins\r\nto die out in the world, Padmapâni Chenresi, the “Lotus‐bearer,” emits a\r\nbrilliant ray of light, and forthwith incarnates himself in one of the two\r\ngreat Lamas—the Dalai and Teschu Lamas; finally, it is believed that he\r\nwill incarnate as the “most perfect Buddha” in Tibet, instead of in India,\r\nwhere his predecessors, the great Rishis and Manus had appeared in the\r\nbeginning of our Race, but now appear no longer. Even the exoteric\r\nappearance of Dhyâni Chenresi is suggestive of the Esoteric Teaching. He\r\nis evidently, like Daksha, the synthesis of all the preceding Races and\r\nthe progenitor of all the _human_ Races after the Third—the first complete\r\none—and thus is represented as the _culmination_ of the _four_ Primeval\r\nRaces in his _eleven‐faced_ form. This is a column built in four rows,\r\neach series having three faces or heads of different complexions; the\r\nthree faces for each Race being typical of its three fundamental\r\nphysiological transformations. The first is white (moon‐coloured); the\r\nsecond is yellow; the third, red‐brown; the fourth, in which are only two\r\nfaces—the third face being left a blank; a reference to the untimely end\r\nof the Atlanteans—is brown‐black. Padmapâni (Daksha) is seated on the\r\ncolumn, and forms the apex. In this reference compare Shloka 39. The Dhyân\r\nChohan is represented with four arms, another allusion to the four Races.\r\nFor while two are folded, the third hand holds a lotus—Padmapâni, the\r\n“Lotus‐bearer”; the flower symbolizing generation—and the fourth holds a\r\nserpent, emblem of the Wisdom in his power. On his neck is a rosary, and\r\non his head the sign of water [Symbol: two horizontal rows of wave‐like\r\nsymbols]—matter, deluge—while on his brow rests the third eye, Shiva’s\r\neye, that of spiritual insight. His name is “Protector” (of Tibet),\r\n“Saviour of Humanity.” On other occasions when he has only two arms, he is\r\nChenresi the Dhyânî, and Bodhisattva, Chakna Padma Karpo, “he who holds a\r\nwhite lotus.” His other name is Chantong, “he of the thousand eyes,” when\r\nhe is endowed with a thousand arms and hands, on the palm of each of which\r\nis represented an eye of Wisdom, these arms radiating from his body like a\r\nforest of rays. Another of his names in Sanskrit is Lokapati or Lokanâtha,\r\n“Lord of the World”; and in Tibetan Jigten Gonpo, “Protector and Saviour”\r\nagainst evil of any kind.(405)\r\n\r\nPadmapâni, however, is the “Lotus‐bearer” symbolically only for the\r\nprofane; esoterically, it means the supporter of the Kalpas, the last of\r\nwhich is called Pâdma, and represents one half of the life of Brahmâ.\r\nThough really a minor Kalpa, it is called Mahâ, “great,” because it\r\ncomprises the age in which Brahmâ sprang from a lotus. Theoretically, the\r\nKalpas are infinite, but practically they are divided and subdivided in\r\nSpace and Time, each division—down to the smallest—having its own Dhyânî\r\nas patron or regent. Padmapâni (Avalokiteshvara) becomes, in China, in his\r\nfemale aspect, Kwan‐yin, “who assumes any form, at pleasure, in order to\r\nsave mankind.” The knowledge of the astrological aspect of the\r\nconstellations on the respective “birthdays” of these Dhyânîs—Amitabha\r\n(the A‐mi‐to Fo, of China), included: _e.g._, on the 19th day of the\r\nsecond month, on the 17th day of the eleventh month, and on the 7th day of\r\nthe third month,(406) etc.—gives the Occultist the greatest facilities for\r\nperforming what are called “magic” feats. The future of an individual is\r\nseen, with all its coming events marshalled in order, in a _magic_ mirror\r\nplaced under the ray of certain constellations. But—beware of the reverse\r\nof the medal, SORCERY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStanza VIII. Evolution Of The Animal Mammalians: The First Fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n    28. How the first mammals were produced. 29. A quasi‐Darwinian\r\n    evolution. 30. The animals get solid bodies. 31. Their separation\r\n    into sexes. 32. The first sin of the mindless men.\r\n\r\n\r\n28. FROM THE DROPS OF SWEAT, FROM THE RESIDUE OF THE SUBSTANCE, MATTER\r\nFROM DEAD BODIES OF MEN AND ANIMALS OF THE WHEEL BEFORE,(407) AND FROM\r\nCAST‐OFF DUST, THE FIRST ANIMALS(408) WERE PRODUCED.\r\n\r\nThe Occult Doctrine maintains that, in this Round, the mammalians were a\r\nlater work of evolution than man. Evolution proceeds in Cycles. The great\r\nManvantaric Cycle of Seven Rounds, beginning in the First Round with the\r\nmineral, vegetable, and animal, brings its evolutionary work on the\r\ndescending arc to a dead stop in the middle of the Fourth Race, at the\r\nclose of the first half of the Fourth Round. It is on our Earth, then—the\r\nFourth Sphere and the lowest—and in the present Round, that this middle\r\npoint has been reached. And since the Monad has passed, after its first\r\n“immetallization” on Globe A, through the mineral, vegetable, and animal\r\nworlds in every degree of the three states of matter, except the last\r\ndegree of the third or solid state, which it reached only at the “mid‐\r\npoint of evolution,” it is but logical and natural that at the beginning\r\nof the Fourth Round on Globe D, Man should be the first to appear; and\r\nalso that his frame should be of the most tenuous matter that is\r\ncompatible with objectivity. To make it still clearer: if the Monad begins\r\nits cycle of incarnations through the three objective kingdoms on the\r\ndescending curved line, it has necessarily to enter on the reäscending\r\ncurved line of the Sphere as a man also. On the descending arc it is the\r\nspiritual which gradually transforms into the material. On the middle line\r\nof the base, Spirit and Matter are equilibrized in Man. On the ascending\r\narc, Spirit is slowly reässerting itself at the expense of the physical,\r\nor Matter, so that, at the close of the Seventh Race of the Seventh Round,\r\nthe Monad will find itself as free from Matter and all its qualities as it\r\nwas in the beginning; having gained in addition the experience and wisdom,\r\nthe fruitage of all its personal lives, without their evil and\r\ntemptations.\r\n\r\nThis order of evolution is found also in the first and second chapters of\r\n_Genesis_, if one reads it in its true esoteric sense; for Chapter i\r\ncontains the history of the first Three Rounds, as well as that of the\r\nfirst Three Races of the Fourth, up to the moment when Man is called to\r\nconscious life by the Elohim of Wisdom. In Chapter i, animals, whales and\r\nfowls of the air, are created before the androgyne Adam.(409) In Chapter\r\nii, Adam (the sexless) comes first, and the animals only appear after him.\r\nEven the state of mental torpor and unconsciousness of the first two\r\nRaces, and of the first half of the Third Race, is symbolized, in the\r\nsecond chapter of _Genesis_, by the _deep sleep of Adam_. It is the\r\ndreamless sleep of mental inaction, the slumber of the Soul and Mind,\r\nwhich is meant by that “sleep,” and not at all the physiological process\r\nof differentiation of sexes, as a learned French theorist, M. Naudin,\r\nimagined.\r\n\r\nThe _Purânas_, the Chaldæan and Egyptian fragments, and also the Chinese\r\ntraditions, all show an agreement with the Secret Doctrine as to the\r\nprocess and order of evolution. We find in them the corroboration of\r\nalmost all our teaching: for instance, the statement concerning the\r\noviparous mode of procreation of the Third Race, and even a hint at a less\r\ninnocent mode of procreation of the first mammal forms. “_Gigantic,\r\ntransparent, dumb and monstrous they were_,” says the Commentary. Study in\r\nthis connection the stories of the several Rishis and their multifarious\r\nprogeny. Pulastya is the father of all the Serpents and Nâgas—an oviparous\r\nbrood; Kashyapa is grandsire, through his wife Tâmrâ, of the birds and of\r\nGaruda, king of the feathered tribe; while by his wife Surabhi, he was the\r\nparent of cows and buffaloes, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the Secret Doctrine, the first Nâgas—Beings wiser than Serpents—are the\r\n“Sons of Will and Yoga,” born before the complete separation of the sexes,\r\n“matured in the man‐bearing eggs(410) produced by the power (Kriyâshakti)\r\nof the holy Sages” of the early Third Race.(411)\r\n\r\n“In these were incarnated the Lords of the three [upper] worlds—the\r\nvarious classes of Rudras, who had been Tushitas, who had been Jayas, who\r\nare Âdityas;” for, as explained by Parâshara: “There are a hundred\r\nappellations of the immeasurably mighty Rudras.”\r\n\r\nSome of the descendants of the primitive Nâgas, the Serpents of Wisdom,\r\npeopled America, when its continent arose during the palmy days of the\r\ngreat Atlantis; America being the Pâtâla or Antipodes of Jambu‐dvîpa, not\r\nof Bhârata‐varsha. Otherwise, whence the traditions and legends—the latter\r\n_always more true than history_, as says Augustin Thierry—and even the\r\nidentity in the names of certain “medicine men” and priests, who exist to\r\nthis day in Mexico? We shall have to say something of the Nargals and the\r\nNagals, and also of Nagalism, called “devil‐worship” by the missionaries.\r\n\r\nIn almost all the _Purânas_, the story of the “Sacrifice of Daksha” is\r\ngiven, the oldest account of which is to be found in the _Vâyu Purâna_.\r\nAllegorical as it is, there is more meaning and biological revelation in\r\nit to a Naturalist, than in all the pseudo‐scientific vagaries, which are\r\nregarded as learned theories and hypotheses.\r\n\r\nDaksha, who is regarded as the Chief Progenitor, is, moreover, pointed out\r\nas the creator of _physical man_, in the “fable” which makes him lose his\r\nhead from his body in the general strife between the Gods and the Raumas.\r\nThis head, being burnt in the fire, is replaced by the _head of a ram_,\r\naccording to the Kâshi Khanda of the _Skanda Purâna_. Now the ram’s head\r\nand horns are ever the symbol of generating power and of reproductive\r\nforce, and are phallic. As we have shown, it is Daksha who establishes the\r\nera of men engendered by sexual intercourse. This mode of procreation did\r\nnot occur suddenly, however, as one might think, but required long ages\r\nbefore it became the one “natural” way. Therefore, Daksha’s sacrifice to\r\nthe Gods is shown to have been interfered with by Shiva—the _Destroying_\r\nDeity, _Evolution and Progress personified_, who is the _Regenerator_ at\r\nthe same time; who destroys things under one form but to recall them to\r\nlife under another more perfect type. Shiva‐Rudra creates the terrible\r\nVîrabhadra, born of his breath, the “thousand‐headed, thousand‐armed”\r\nmonster, and commissions him to destroy the sacrifice prepared by Daksha.\r\nThen Vîrabhadra, “abiding in the region of ghosts (ethereal men) ...\r\ncreated from _the pores of his skin_ (Roma‐kûpas) powerful Raumas.”(412)\r\nNow, however mythical the allegory, the _Mahâbhârata_(413)—which is as\r\nmuch history as is the _Iliad_—shows the Raumas and other races springing\r\nin the same manner from the Roma‐kûpas, hair or skin pores. This\r\nallegorical description of Daksha’s “sacrifice” is full of significance to\r\nthe students of the Secret Doctrine who know of the “Sweat‐born.”\r\n\r\nIn the _Vâyu Purâna’s_ account of the sacrifice, moreover, it is said to\r\nhave taken place in the presence of creatures _born from the egg_, from\r\nthe vapour, vegetation, pores of the skin, and, finally only, from the\r\nwomb.(414)\r\n\r\nDaksha typifies the early Third Race, holy and pure, as yet devoid of an\r\nIndividual Ego, and possessing passive capacities only. Brahmâ, therefore,\r\ncommands him to create (in the exoteric texts); when, obeying the command,\r\nhe made “inferior and superior” (Avara and Vara) progeny (Putra), _bipeds_\r\nand _quadrupeds_; and by his _will_, gave birth to females, to the Gods,\r\nthe Daityas (Giants of the Fourth Race), the snake‐gods, animals, cattle\r\nand the Dânavas (Titans and Demon Magicians) and other beings.\r\n\r\n\r\n    From that period forward, _living creatures were engendered by\r\n    sexual intercourse. Before the time of Daksha, they were variously\r\n    propagated_—by the _will_, by sight, by touch, and by the\r\n    influence of religious austerities practised by devout sages and\r\n    holy saints.(415)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now comes the simply zoölogical teaching.\r\n\r\n29. ANIMALS WITH BONES, DRAGONS OF THE DEEP, AND FLYING SARPAS(416) WERE\r\nADDED TO THE CREEPING THINGS. THEY THAT CREEP ON THE GROUND GOT WINGS.\r\nTHEY OF THE LONG NECKS IN THE WATER BECAME THE PROGENITORS OF THE FOWLS OF\r\nTHE AIR.\r\n\r\nThis is a point on which the teachings and modern biological speculation\r\nare in perfect accord. The missing links representing this transition\r\nprocess between reptile and bird are apparent to the veriest bigot,\r\nespecially in the Ornithoscelidæ, Hesperornis, and the Archæopteryx of\r\nVogt.\r\n\r\n30. DURING THE THIRD,(417) THE BONELESS ANIMALS GREW AND CHANGED; THEY\r\nBECAME ANIMALS WITH BONES, THEIR CHHÂYÂS BECAME SOLID.(418)\r\n\r\nVertebrates, and after that mammalians. Before that the animals were also\r\nethereal proto‐organisms, just as man was.\r\n\r\n31. THE ANIMALS SEPARATED THE FIRST.(419) THEY BEGAN TO BREED. THE TWO‐\r\nFOLD MAN(420) SEPARATED ALSO. HE(421) SAID: “LET US AS THEY; LET US UNITE\r\nAND MAKE CREATURES.” THEY DID....\r\n\r\n32. AND THOSE WHICH HAD NO SPARK(422) TOOK HUGE SHE‐ANIMALS UNTO THEM.\r\nTHEY BEGAT UPON THEM DUMB RACES. DUMB THEY(423) WERE THEMSELVES. BUT THEIR\r\nTONGUES UNTIED.(424) THE TONGUES OF THEIR PROGENY REMAINED STILL. MONSTERS\r\nTHEY BRED. A RACE OF CROOKED RED‐HAIR‐COVERED MONSTERS GOING ON ALL\r\nFOURS.(425) A DUMB RACE, TO KEEP THE SHAME UNTOLD.(426)\r\n\r\nThe fact of former hermaphrodite mammals and the subsequent separation of\r\nsexes is now indisputable, even from the standpoint of Biology. As Prof.\r\nOscar Schmidt, an avowed Darwinist, shows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Use and disuse, combined with selection, elucidate [?] _the\r\n    separation of the sexes_, and the existence, otherwise totally\r\n    incomprehensible, of rudimentary sexual organs. In the Vertebrata\r\n    especially, _each sex possesses such distinct traces of the\r\n    reproductive apparatus characteristic of the other_, that even\r\n    antiquity assumed hermaphroditism as a natural primæval condition\r\n    of mankind.... The tenacity with which these rudiments of sexual\r\n    organs are inherited is remarkable. In the class of mammals,\r\n    actual hermaphroditism is unheard of, although through the whole\r\n    period of their development they drag along with them these\r\n    residues, borne by _their unknown ancestry_, no one can say how\r\n    long.(427)\r\n\r\n\r\n“The animals separated the first,” says Shloka 31. Bear in mind that at\r\nthat period men were different, even physiologically, to what they are\r\nnow; the middle point of the Fifth Race being already passed. We are not\r\ntold what the “huge she‐animals” were; but they certainly were as\r\ndifferent from any we now know, as were the “men” from the men of to‐day.\r\n\r\nThis was the first physical “fall into matter” of some of the then\r\nexisting and lower races. Bear in mind Shloka 24. The “Sons of Wisdom” had\r\nspurned the _early_ Third Race, _i.e._, the non‐developed, and are shown\r\nincarnating in, and thereby endowing with intellect, the _later_ Third\r\nRace. Thus the sin of the brainless or “mindless” Races, who had no\r\n“spark” and were irresponsible, fell upon those who failed to do by them\r\ntheir Karmic duty.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat May Be The Objections To The Foregoing.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus Occultism rejects the idea that Nature developed man from the ape, or\r\neven from an ancestor common to both; but, on the contrary, traces some of\r\nthe most anthropoid species to the Third Race man of the early Atlantean\r\nPeriod. As this proposition will be maintained and defended elsewhere, a\r\nfew words more are all that are needed at present. For greater clearness,\r\nhowever, we shall repeat in brief what was said previously in Volume I,\r\nStanza VI.\r\n\r\nOur teachings show that, while it is quite correct to say that Nature had,\r\nat one time, built round the human astral form an _ape‐like external_\r\nshape, it is also as correct that this shape was no more that of the\r\n“missing link,” than were the multitudinous other coverings of that astral\r\nform, during the course of its natural evolution through all the kingdoms\r\nof Nature. Nor was it, as has been shown, on this Fourth Round Planet that\r\nsuch evolution took place, but only during the First, Second, and Third\r\nRounds, when Man was, in turn, “a stone, a plant, and an animal” until he\r\nbecame what he was in the First Root‐Race of present Humanity. The real\r\nline of evolution differs from the Darwinian, and the two systems are\r\nirreconcilable, unless the latter is divorced from the dogmas of “natural\r\nselection” and the like. Indeed, between the Moneron of Hæckel and the\r\nSarîsripa of Manu, there lies an impassable chasm in the shape of the\r\nJîva; for the “human” Monad, whether “immetallized” in the stone‐atom, or\r\n“in‐vegetalized” in the plant, or “inanimalized” in the animal, is still\r\never a divine, hence also a _human_ Monad. It ceases to be human only when\r\nit becomes _absolutely divine_. The terms “mineral,” “vegetable” and\r\n“animal” Monad are intended to create a superficial distinction: there is\r\nno such thing as a Monad (Jîva) other than divine, and consequently having\r\nonce been, or having in the future to become, human. The latter term has\r\nto remain meaningless unless this difference is well understood. The Monad\r\nis a drop out of the Shoreless Ocean beyond, or, to be correct, _within_,\r\nthe plane of primæval differentiation. It is _divine_ in its higher and\r\n_human_ in its lower condition—the adjectives “higher” and “lower” being\r\nused for lack of better words—but a Monad it remains at all times, save in\r\nthe Nirvânic state, under whatever conditions, or whatever external forms.\r\nAs the Logos reflects the Universe in the Divine Mind, and the Manifested\r\nUniverse reflects itself in each of its Monads, as Leibnitz put it\r\nrepeating an Eastern teaching, so the Monad has, during the cycle of its\r\nincarnations, to reflect in itself every _root‐form_ of each kingdom.\r\nTherefore, the Kabalists say correctly that “Man becomes a stone, a plant,\r\nan animal, a man, a spirit, and finally God,” thus accomplishing his cycle\r\nor circuit and returning to the point from which he had started as the\r\n_Heavenly Man_. But by “Man” the Divine Monad is meant, and not the\r\nThinking Entity, much less his Physical Body. The men of Science now try\r\nto trace the immortal Soul, while rejecting its existence, through a\r\nseries of animal forms from the lowest to the highest; whereas, in truth,\r\nall the present fauna are the descendants of those primordial monsters of\r\nwhich the Stanzas speak. The animals—the creeping beasts and those in the\r\nwaters that preceded Man in this Fourth Round, as well as those\r\ncontemporary with the Third Race, and again the mammalia that are\r\nposterior to the Third and Fourth Races—all are either directly or\r\nindirectly the mutual and correlative product, _physically_, of Man. It is\r\ncorrect to say that the man of this Manvantara, _i.e._, of the three\r\npreceding Rounds, has passed through all the kingdoms of Nature. That he\r\nwas “a stone, a plant, an animal.” But (_a_) these stones, plants, and\r\nanimals were the prototypes, the filmy presentments of those of the Fourth\r\nRound; and (_b_) even those at the beginning of the Fourth Round were the\r\nastral shadows, as the Occultists express it, of the present stones,\r\nplants and animals. And finally, neither the forms nor genera of either\r\nman, animal, or plant were what they became later. Thus the astral\r\nprototypes of the lower beings of the animal kingdom of the Fourth Round,\r\nwhich _preceded_ the Chhâyâs of Men, were the consolidated, though still\r\nvery ethereal _sheaths_ of the still more ethereal forms, or models,\r\nproduced at the close of the Third Round on Globe D, as set forth in\r\n_Esoteric Buddhism_; produced “from the residue of the substance; matter\r\nfrom dead bodies of men and [other _extinct_] animals of the Wheel\r\nbefore,” or the previous _Third_ Round—as Shloka 28 tells us. Hence, while\r\nthe nondescript “animals” that preceded the Astral Man at the beginning of\r\nthis Life‐cycle on our Earth were still, so to speak, the progeny of the\r\nMan of the Third Round, the mammalians of this Round owe their existence,\r\nin a great measure, to Man again. Moreover, the “ancestor” of the present\r\nanthropoid animal, the ape, is the direct production of the yet mindless\r\nMan, who desecrated his human dignity by putting himself physically on the\r\nlevel of an animal.\r\n\r\nThe above accounts for some of the alleged physiological proofs, brought\r\nforward by the Anthropologists as a demonstration of the descent of man\r\nfrom the animals.\r\n\r\nThe point most insisted upon by the Evolutionists is that, “The history of\r\nthe embryo is an epitome of that of the race.” That:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Every organism, in its development from the egg, runs through a\r\n    series of forms, through which, in like succession, its ancestors\r\n    have passed in the long course of earth’s history.(428) The\r\n    history of the embryo ... is a picture in little, and outline of\r\n    that of the race. _This conception forms the gist of our\r\n    fundamental biogenetic law, which we are obliged to place at the\r\n    head of the study of the fundamental law of organic\r\n    development._(429)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis modern theory was known as a fact to, and far more philosophically\r\nexpressed by, the Sages and Occultists from the remotest ages. A passage\r\nfrom _Isis Unveiled_ may here be cited to furnish a few points of\r\ncomparison. It was asked why, with all their great learning, Physiologists\r\nwere unable to explain teratological phenomena?\r\n\r\n\r\n    Any Anatomist who has made the development and growth of the\r\n    embryo ... “a subject of special study,” can tell, without much\r\n    brain‐work, what daily experience and the evidence of his own eyes\r\n    show him, viz., that up to a certain period, the human embryo is a\r\n    facsimile of a young batrachian in its first remove from the\r\n    spawn—a tadpole. But no Physiologist or Anatomist seems to have\r\n    had the idea of applying to the development of the human\r\n    being—from the first instant of its physical appearance as a germ\r\n    to its ultimate formation and birth—the Pythagorean esoteric\r\n    doctrine of metempsychosis, so erroneously interpreted by critics.\r\n    The meaning of the Kabalistic axiom: “A stone becomes a plant; a\r\n    plant, a beast; a beast, a man,” etc., was mentioned in another\r\n    place in relation to the spiritual and physical evolution of men\r\n    on this Earth. We will now add a few more words to make the matter\r\n    clearer.\r\n\r\n    What is the primitive shape of the future man? A grain, a\r\n    corpuscle, say some Physiologists; a molecule, an ovum of the\r\n    ovum, say others. If it could be analyzed—by the microscope or\r\n    otherwise—of what ought we to expect to find it composed?\r\n    Analogically, we should say, of a nucleus of inorganic matter,\r\n    deposited from the circulation at the germinating point, and\r\n    united with a deposit of organic matter. In other words, this\r\n    infinitesimal nucleus of the future man is composed of the same\r\n    elements as a stone—of the same elements as the Earth, which the\r\n    man is destined to inhabit. Moses is cited by the Kabalists as\r\n    authority for the remark, that it required earth and water to make\r\n    a living being, and thus it may be said that man first appears as\r\n    a stone.\r\n\r\n    At the end of three or four weeks the ovum has assumed a plant‐\r\n    like appearance, one extremity having become spheroidal and the\r\n    other tapering, like a carrot. Upon dissection it is found to be\r\n    composed, like an onion, of very delicate laminæ or coats,\r\n    enclosing a liquid. The laminæ approach each other at the lower\r\n    end, and the embryo hangs from the root of the umbilicus almost\r\n    like the fruit from the bough. The stone has now become changed,\r\n    by “metempsychosis,” into a plant. Then the embryonic creature\r\n    begins to shoot out, from the inside outward, its limbs, and\r\n    develops its features. The eyes are visible as two black dots; the\r\n    ears, nose, and mouth form depressions, like the points of a\r\n    pineapple, before they begin to project. The embryo develops into\r\n    an animal‐like fœtus—the shape of a tadpole—and, like an\r\n    amphibious reptile, lives in water and develops from it. Its monad\r\n    has not yet become either human or immortal, for the Kabalists\r\n    tell us that this only occurs at the “fourth hour.” One by one the\r\n    fœtus assumes the characteristics of the human being, the first\r\n    flutter of the immortal breath passes through its being: it moves;\r\n    ... and the divine essence settles in the infant frame, which it\r\n    will inhabit until the moment of physical death, when man becomes\r\n    a spirit.\r\n\r\n    This mysterious process of a nine‐months’ formation, the Kabalists\r\n    call the completion of the “individual cycle of evolution.” As the\r\n    fœtus develops amidst the _liquor amnii_ in the womb, so the\r\n    Earths germinate in the Universal Ether, or Astral Fluid, in the\r\n    Womb of the Universe. These cosmic children, like their pigmy\r\n    inhabitants, are first nuclei; then ovules; then gradually mature;\r\n    and becoming mothers, in their turn, develop mineral, vegetable,\r\n    animal, and human forms. From centre to circumference, from the\r\n    imperceptible vesicle to the uttermost conceivable bounds of the\r\n    cosmos, those glorious thinkers, the Occultists, trace cycle\r\n    merging into cycle, containing and contained in an endless series.\r\n    The embryo evolving in its pre‐natal sphere, the individual in his\r\n    family, the family in the state, the state in mankind, the earth\r\n    in our system, that system in its central universe, the universe\r\n    in the Kosmos, and the Kosmos in the ONE CAUSE—the Boundless and\r\n    Endless.(430)\r\n\r\n\r\nThus runs _their_ philosophy of evolution, differing as we see, from that\r\nof Hæckel.\r\n\r\n\r\n    All are but parts of one stupendous whole,\r\n    Whose body Nature is, and (Parabrahm) the Soul.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are the proofs of Occultism, and they are rejected by Science. But\r\nhow is the chasm between the mind of man and animal to be bridged in this\r\ncase? How, if the anthropoid and homo primigenius had, _argumenti gratiâ_,\r\na common ancestor—in the way modern speculation puts it—how did the two\r\ngroups diverge so widely from one another as regards mental capacity?\r\nTrue, the Occultist may be told that in every case Occultism does what\r\nScience repeats; it gives a _common_ ancestor to ape and man, since it\r\nmakes the former issue from Primæval Man. Aye, but that “Primæval Man” was\r\n_man_ only in external form. He was _mindless_ and _soulless_ at the time\r\nhe begot, with a female animal monster, the forefather of a series of\r\napes. This speculation—if speculation it be—is at least logical, and fills\r\nthe chasm between the mind of man and animal. Thus it accounts for and\r\nexplains the hitherto unaccountable and inexplicable. The fact—of which\r\nScience is almost certain—that, in the present stage of evolution, no\r\nissue can follow from the union of man and animal, is considered and\r\nexplained elsewhere.\r\n\r\nNow what is the fundamental difference between the accepted (or nearly so)\r\nconclusions—as enunciated in _The Pedigree of Man_—that man and ape have a\r\ncommon ancestor, and the teachings of Occultism, which deny this\r\nconclusion and accept the fact that all things and all living beings have\r\noriginated from one common source? Materialistic Science makes man evolve\r\ngradually to what _he is now_. Starting from the first protoplasmic speck\r\ncalled Moneron—which we are told has, like the rest, “originated in the\r\ncourse of immeasurable ages from a few, or from one simple, _spontaneously\r\narising_ original form, that has obeyed one law of evolution”—he is made\r\nto pass through “unknown and unknowable” types up to the ape, and thence\r\nto the human being. Where the transitional shapes are discoverable we are\r\nnot told; for the simple reason that no “missing‐links” between man and\r\nthe apes have ever yet been found, though this fact in no way prevents men\r\nlike Hæckel from inventing them _ad libitum_.\r\n\r\nNor will they ever be met with; simply, again, because that link which\r\nunites man with his real ancestry is searched for on the objective plane\r\nand in the material world of forms, whereas it is safely hidden from the\r\nmicroscope and dissecting knife _within_ the animal tabernacle of man\r\nhimself. We repeat what we have said in _Isis Unveiled_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    All things had their origin in Spirit—evolution having originally\r\n    begun from above and proceeded downward, instead of the reverse,\r\n    as taught in the Darwinian theory. In other words, there has been\r\n    a gradual materialization of forms until a fixed ultimate of\r\n    debasement is reached. This point is that at which the doctrine of\r\n    modern evolution enters into the arena of speculative hypothesis.\r\n    Arrived at this period we shall find it easier to understand\r\n    Hæckel’s _Anthropogeny_, which traces the pedigree of man “from\r\n    its protoplasmic root, sodden in the mud of seas which existed\r\n    before the oldest of the fossiliferous rocks were deposited,”\r\n    according to Mr. Huxley’s exposition. We may more easily still\r\n    believe man (of the Third Round) evolved “by gradual modification\r\n    of an [astral] mammal of ape‐like organization,” when we remember\r\n    that the same theory, in a more condensed and less elegant, but\r\n    equally comprehensible, phraseology, was said by Berosus to have\r\n    been taught many thousands of years before his time by the man‐\r\n    fish Oannes or Dagon, the semi‐demon of Babylonia(431) (though on\r\n    somewhat modified lines).\r\n\r\n    But what lies back of the Darwinian line of descent? So far as\r\n    Darwin is concerned nothing but “unverifiable hypotheses.” For, as\r\n    he puts it, he views all beings “as the lineal descendants of some\r\n    few beings which lived long before the first bed of the Silurian\r\n    system was deposited.”(432) He does not attempt to show us what\r\n    these “few beings” were. But it answers our purpose quite as well,\r\n    for, in the bare admission of their existence, recourse to the\r\n    ancients for corroboration and elaboration of the idea receives\r\n    the stamp of scientific approbation.(433)\r\n\r\n\r\nTruly, as we said in our first work, if we accept Darwin’s theory of the\r\ndevelopment of species, we find that his starting‐point lies in front of\r\nan open door. We are at liberty either to remain within with him, or cross\r\nthe threshold, beyond which lies the limitless and the incomprehensible,\r\nor rather the Unutterable. If our mortal language is inadequate to express\r\nwhat our spirit—while on this earth—dimly foresees in the great “Beyond,”\r\nit _must_ realize it at some point in the timeless Eternity. But what lies\r\n“beyond” Hæckel’s theory? Why Bathybius Hæckelii, and no more!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStanza IX. The Final Evolution Of Man.\r\n\r\n\r\n    33. The creators repent. 34.

SEEING WHICH,(434) THE LHAS(435) WHO HAD NOT BUILT MEN,(436) WEPT,\r\nSAYING:\r\n\r\n34. “THE AMÂNASA(437) HAVE DEFILED OUR FUTURE ABODES. THIS IS KARMA. LET\r\nUS DWELL IN THE OTHERS. LET US TEACH THEM BETTER, LEST WORSE SHOULD\r\nHAPPEN.” THEY DID....\r\n\r\n35. THEN ALL MEN BECAME ENDOWED WITH MANAS.(438) THEY SAW THE SIN OF THE\r\nMINDLESS.\r\n\r\nBut they had already _separated_, before the ray of divine reason had\r\nenlightened the dark region of their hitherto slumbering minds, and had\r\n_sinned_. That is to say, they had committed evil unconsciously, by\r\nproducing an effect which was unnatural. Yet, like the other six primitive\r\nbrother or fellow races, even so this seventh, henceforth degenerated\r\nrace, which will have to bide its time for its final development on\r\naccount of the _sin_ committed—even this race will find itself _on the\r\nlast day_ on one of the Seven Paths. For:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Wise(439) guard the home of nature’s order, they assume\r\n    excellent forms in secret.(440)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut we must see whether the “animals” tampered with, were of the same kind\r\nas those known to Zoölogy.\r\n\r\nThe “Fall” occurred, according to the testimony of ancient Wisdom and the\r\nold records, as soon as Daksha—the reïncarnated Creator of men and things\r\nin the early Third Race—disappeared to make room for that portion of\r\nmankind which had “separated.” This is how one Commentary explains the\r\ndetails that preceded the “Fall”:\r\n\r\n_In the initial period of man’s Fourth Evolution, the human kingdom\r\nbranched off in several and various directions. The outward shape of its\r\nfirst specimens was not uniform, for the vehicles [the egg‐like, external\r\nshells, in which the future fully physical man gestated] were often\r\ntampered with, before they hardened, by huge animals, of species now\r\nunknown, and belonging to the tentative efforts of Nature. The result was\r\nthat intermediate races of monsters, half animals, half men, were\r\nproduced. But as they were failures, they were not allowed to breathe long\r\nand live, although, the intrinsically paramount power of psychic over\r\nphysical nature being yet very weak, and hardly established, the __“__Egg‐\r\nborn__”__ Sons had taken several of their females unto themselves as\r\nmates, and bred other human monsters. Later, animal species and human\r\nraces becoming gradually equilibrized, they separated, and mated no\r\nlonger. Man created no more—he begot. But he also begot animals as well as\r\nmen, in days of old. Therefore the Sages [or wise men], who speak of males\r\nwho had no more will‐begotten offspring, but begat various animals along\r\nwith Dânavas [Giants] on females of other species—animals being as [or in\r\nthe manner of] sons putative to them; and they [the human males] refusing\r\nin time to be regarded as [putative] fathers of dumb creatures—spoke\r\ntruthfully and wisely. Upon seeing this [state of things], the Kings and\r\nLords of the last Races [of the Third and the Fourth] placed the seal of\r\nprohibition upon the sinful intercourse. It interfered with Karma, it\r\ndeveloped new [Karma]_(_441_)_. They [the Divine Kings] struck the\r\nculprits with sterility. They destroyed the Red and Blue Races._(442)\r\n\r\nIn another we find:\r\n\r\n_There were blue and red‐faced animal‐men even in later times; not from\r\nactual intercourse [between the human and animal species], but by\r\ndescent._\r\n\r\nAnd still another passage mentions:\r\n\r\n_Red‐haired, swarthy men going on all‐fours, who bend and unbend [stand\r\nerect and fall on their hands again], who speak as their forefathers, and\r\nrun on their hands as their giant fore‐mothers._\r\n\r\nPerchance in these specimens Hæckelians might recognize, not the “Homo\r\nPrimigenius,” but some of the lower tribes, such as some tribes of the\r\nAustralian savages. Nevertheless, even these are not descended from the\r\nanthropoid apes, but from human fathers and semi‐human mothers, or, to\r\nspeak more correctly, from human monsters—those “failures” mentioned in\r\nthe first Commentary. The real anthropoids, Hæckel’s Catarrhini and\r\nPlatyrrhini, came far later, in the closing times of Atlantis. The Orang‐\r\nOutang, the Gorilla, the Chimpanzee and Cynocephalus are the latest and\r\npurely physical evolutions from lower anthropoid mammalians. They have a\r\nspark of the purely human essence in them; man on the other hand, has not\r\none drop of pithecoid(443) blood in his veins. Thus saith old Wisdom and\r\nuniversal tradition.\r\n\r\nHow was the separation of sexes effected? it is asked. Are we to believe\r\nin the old Jewish fable of the rib of Adam yielding Eve? Even such belief\r\nis more logical and reasonable than the descent of man from the Quadrumana\r\nwithout any reservation; as the former hides an Esoteric truth under a\r\nfabulous version, while the latter conceals no deeper fact than a desire\r\nto force upon mankind a materialistic fiction. The rib is bone, and when\r\nwe read in _Genesis_ that Eve was made out of the rib, it only means that\r\nthe Race “with bones” was produced out of a previous Race and Races, which\r\nwere “boneless.” This is an Esoteric tenet spread far and wide. It is\r\nalmost universal under its various forms. A Tahitian tradition states that\r\nman was created out of Aræa, “red earth.” Taaroa, the Creative Power, the\r\nchief God, “put man to sleep for long years, for several lives.” This\r\nmeans racial periods, and is a reference to his _mental sleep_, as shown\r\nelsewhere. During that time the deity pulled an Ivi (bone) out of man and\r\nshe became a woman.(444)\r\n\r\nNevertheless, whatever the allegory may signify, even its exoteric meaning\r\nnecessitates a _divine_ Builder of man—a “Progenitor.” Do we then believe\r\nin such “supernatural” Beings? We say: No. Occultism has never believed in\r\nanything, whether animate or inanimate, _outside_ Nature. Nor are we\r\nCosmolaters or Polytheists for believing in “Heavenly Man” and Divine Men,\r\nfor we have the accumulated testimony of the ages, with its unvarying\r\nevidence on every essential point, to support us in this; the Wisdom of\r\nthe Ancients and _universal_ tradition. We reject, however, such\r\ngroundless and baseless traditions as have outgrown strict allegory and\r\nsymbolism, although they may have found acceptance in exoteric creeds. But\r\nthat which is preserved in _unanimous_ tradition, only the wilfully blind\r\ncould reject. Hence we believe in races of Beings other than our own in\r\nfar remote geological periods; in races of ethereal, following\r\n_incorporeal_ (Arûpa) Men, with form but no solid substance, giants who\r\npreceded us pigmies; in Dynasties of Divine Beings, those Kings and\r\nInstructors of the Third Race in arts and sciences, compared with which\r\nour little Modern Science stands less chance than elementary arithmetic\r\nwith geometry.\r\n\r\nNo, certainly not. We do not believe in _supernatural_ but only in\r\n_superhuman_, or rather _interhuman_, intelligences. One can easily\r\nappreciate the feeling of reluctance that an educated person would have to\r\nbeing classed with the superstitious and ignorant; and even realize the\r\ngreat truth uttered by Renan when he says that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The supernatural has become like the original sin, a blemish that\r\n    everyone seems ashamed of—even those most religious persons who\r\n    refuse in our day to accept be it a minimum of Bible miracles in\r\n    all their crudeness, and who, seeking to reduce them to the\r\n    minimum, hide and conceal it in the furthermost corners of the\r\n    past.(445)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the “supernatural” of Renan belongs to dogma and its dead letter. It\r\nhas nought to do with its spirit nor with the reality of facts in Nature.\r\nIf Theology asks us to believe that it was only four or five thousand\r\nyears ago that men lived 900 years and more, that a portion of mankind,\r\nthe enemies of the people of Israel exclusively, was composed of giants\r\nand monsters, we decline to believe that such a thing existed in Nature\r\nonly five _thousand_ years back. For Nature never proceeds by jumps and\r\nstarts, and logic and common sense, besides Geology, Anthropology and\r\nEthnology, have justly rebelled against such assertions. But if this same\r\nTheology, giving up her fantastic chronology, had claimed that men lived\r\n969 years—the age of Methuselah—five _million_ years ago, we should have\r\nnothing to say against the claim. For in those days the physical frame of\r\nmen was, compared to the present human body, as that of a Megalosaurus to\r\na common lizard.\r\n\r\nA Naturalist suggests another difficulty. The human is the only species\r\nwhich, however unequal in its races, can breed together. “There is no\r\nquestion of selection between _human races_,” say the anti‐Darwinists, and\r\nno Evolutionist can deny the argument—one which very triumphantly proves\r\n_specific unity_. How then can Occultism insist that a portion of the\r\nFourth Race humanity begot young ones from females of another, only semi‐\r\nhuman, if not quite an animal, race; the hybrids resulting from which\r\nunion not only bred freely but produced the ancestors of the modern\r\nanthropoid apes? Esoteric Science replies to this that it was in the very\r\nbeginnings of physical man. Since then, Nature has changed her ways, and\r\nsterility is the only result of the crime of man’s bestiality. But we have\r\neven to‐day proofs of this. The Secret Doctrine teaches that the _specific\r\nunity of mankind_ is not without exceptions even now. For there are, or\r\nrather still were a few years ago, descendants of these half‐animal tribes\r\nor races, both of remote Lemurian and Lemuro‐Atlantean origin. The world\r\nknows them as Tasmanians (now extinct), Australians, Andaman Islanders,\r\netc. The descent of the Tasmanians can be almost proved by a fact, which\r\nstruck Darwin a good deal, without his being able to make anything of it.\r\nThis fact deserves notice.\r\n\r\nDe Quatrefages and other Naturalists, who seek to prove Monogenesis by the\r\nvery fact of every race of mankind being capable of crossing with every\r\nother, have left out of their calculations _exceptions_, which do not in\r\nthis case confirm the rule. Human crossing may have been a general rule\r\nfrom the time of the separation of sexes, but this does not prevent\r\nanother law asserting itself, viz., sterility between two human races,\r\njust as between two animal species of different kinds, in those rare cases\r\nwhen a European, condescending to see in a female of a savage tribe a\r\nmate, happens to choose a member of such mixed tribes.(446) Darwin notes\r\nsuch a case in a Tasmanian tribe, whose women were suddenly struck with\r\nsterility, _en masse_, some time after the arrival among them of European\r\ncolonists. The great Naturalist tried to explain this fact by change of\r\ndiet, food conditions, etc., but finally gave up the solution of the\r\nmystery. For the Occultist it is very evident. “Crossing,” as it is\r\ncalled, of Europeans with Tasmanian women—_i.e._, the representatives of a\r\nrace, whose progenitors were a “soulless”(447) and mindless monster, with\r\na real human, though still as mindless a man—brought on sterility; and\r\nthis, not only as a consequence of a physiological law, but also as a\r\ndecree of Karmic evolution in the question of further survival of the\r\nabnormal race. In no one point of the above is Science prepared to believe\r\n_as yet_—but it will have to in the long run. Esoteric Philosophy, let us\r\nremember, only fills the gaps left by Science and corrects her false\r\npremisses.\r\n\r\nYet, in this particular, Geology and even Botany and Zoology support the\r\nEsoteric Teachings. It has been suggested by many Geologists that the\r\nAustralian native—coëxisting as he does with an _archaic fauna and\r\nflora_—must date back to an enormous antiquity. The whole environment of\r\nthis mysterious race, about whose origin Ethnology is silent, is a\r\ntestimony to the truth of the Esoteric position. As Jukes says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is a very curious fact that not only these marsupial animals\r\n    [the mammals found in the Oxfordshire Stone‐field Slates], but\r\n    several of the shells—as for instance, the Trigonias and even some\r\n    of the plants found fossil in the Oolitic rocks—much more nearly\r\n    resemble those now living in Australia than the living forms of\r\n    any other part of the globe. This might be explained on the\r\n    supposition that, since the Oolitic [Jurassic] period _less change\r\n    has taken place in Australia than elsewhere_, and that the\r\n    Australian flora and fauna consequently retain something of the\r\n    Oolitic type, _while it had been altogether supplanted and\r\n    replaced on the rest of the globe_ [! !].(448)\r\n\r\n\r\nNow why has less change taken place in Australia than elsewhere? Where is\r\nthe _raison d’être_ for such a “curse of retardation”? It is simply\r\nbecause the nature of the environment develops _pari passu_ with the race\r\nconcerned. Correspondences rule in every quarter. The survivors of those\r\nlater Lemurians, who escaped the destruction of their fellows when the\r\nmain Continent was submerged, became the ancestors of a portion of the\r\npresent native tribes. Being a very low sub‐race, begotten originally of\r\nanimals, of monsters, whose very fossils are now resting miles under the\r\nsea floors, their stock has since existed in an environment strongly\r\nsubjected to the _law of retardation_. Australia is one of the oldest\r\nlands now above the waters, and in the senile decrepitude of old age, its\r\n“_virgin_ soil” notwithstanding. It can produce no new forms, unless\r\nhelped by new and fresh races, and artificial cultivation and breeding.\r\n\r\nTo return once more, however, to the history of the Third Race, the\r\n“Sweat‐born,” the “Egg‐bearing,” and the “Androgyne.” Almost sexless, in\r\nits early beginnings, it became bisexual or androgynous; very gradually of\r\ncourse. The passage from the first to the last transformation required\r\nnumberless generations, during which the simple cell that issued from the\r\nearliest parent (the two in one), first developed into a bisexual being;\r\nand then the cell, becoming a regular egg, gave forth a unisexual\r\ncreature. The Third Race mankind is the most mysterious of all the five\r\nhitherto developed Races. The mystery of the “How” of the generation of\r\nthe distinct sexes must, of course, be very obscure here, as it is the\r\nbusiness of an embryologist and a specialist; the present work giving only\r\nfaint outlines of the process. But it is evident that the units of the\r\nThird Race humanity began to separate in their pre‐natal shells, or\r\neggs,(449) and to issue out of them as distinct male and female babes,\r\nages after the appearance of its early progenitors. And, as time rolled on\r\nits geological periods, the newly born sub‐races began to lose their natal\r\ncapacities. Toward the end of the fourth sub‐race of the Third Race, the\r\nbabe lost its faculty of walking as soon as liberated from its shell, and\r\nby the end of the fifth, mankind was born under the same conditions and by\r\nidentically the same process as our historical generations. This required,\r\nof course, millions of years. The reader has been made acquainted with the\r\napproximate figures, at least of the exoteric calculations.(450)\r\n\r\nWe are approaching the turning‐point of the evolution of the Races. Let us\r\nsee what Occult Philosophy says on the origin of language.\r\n\r\n36. THE FOURTH RACE DEVELOPED SPEECH.\r\n\r\nThe Commentaries explain that the First Race—the ethereal or astral Sons\r\nof Yoga, also called “Self‐born”—was, in our sense, speechless, for it was\r\ndevoid of mind on our plane. The Second Race had a “sound‐language,” to\r\nwit, chant‐like sounds composed of vowels alone. The Third Race developed\r\nin the beginning a kind of language which was only a slight improvement on\r\nthe various sounds in Nature, on the cry of gigantic insects and of the\r\nfirst animals, which, however, were hardly nascent in the day of the\r\n“Sweat‐born” or the _early_ Third Race. In its second half, when the\r\n“Sweat‐born” gave birth to the “Egg‐born,” the _middle_ Third Race; and\r\nwhen these, instead of “hatching out”—may the reader pardon the rather\r\nridiculous expression when applied to human beings in our age—as\r\nandrogynous beings, began to evolve into separate males and females; and\r\nwhen the same law of evolution led them to reproduce their kind\r\nsexually—an act which forced the Creative Gods, compelled by Karmic law,\r\nto incarnate in _mindless_ men; then only was speech developed. But even\r\nthen it was still no better than a tentative effort. The whole human race\r\nwas at that time of “one language and of one lip.” This did not prevent\r\nthe last two sub‐races of the Third Race(451) from building cities, and\r\nsowing far and wide the first seeds of civilization under the guidance of\r\ntheir Divine Instructors,(452) and their own already awakened minds. Let\r\nthe reader also bear in mind that, as each of the seven Races is divided\r\ninto four Ages—the Golden, Silver, Bronze, and Iron Age—so is every\r\nsmallest division of such Races. Speech then developed, according to\r\nOccult Teaching, in the following order:\r\n\r\nI. _Monosyllabic speech_: that of the first approximately fully developed\r\nhuman beings at the close of the Third Root‐Race, the “golden‐coloured,”\r\nyellow‐complexioned men, after their separation into sexes, and the full\r\nawakening of their minds. Before that, they communicated through what\r\nwould now be called “thought‐transference,” though, with the exception of\r\nthe Race called the “Sons of Will and Yoga”—the first in whom the “Sons of\r\nWisdom” had incarnated—thought was but very little developed in nascent\r\nphysical man, and never soared above a low terrestrial level. Their\r\nphysical bodies belonging to the Earth, their Monads remained on a higher\r\nplane altogether. Language could not be well developed before the full\r\nacquisition and development of their reasoning faculties. This\r\nmonosyllabic speech was the vowel‐parent, so to speak, of the monosyllabic\r\nlanguages mixed with hard consonants, still in use amongst the yellow\r\nraces which are known to the Anthropologist.(453)\r\n\r\nII. _Agglutinative speech_: these linguistic characteristics developed\r\ninto the agglutinative languages. The latter were spoken by some Atlantean\r\nraces, while other parent stocks of the Fourth Race preserved the mother‐\r\nlanguage. And as languages have their cyclic evolution, their childhood,\r\npurity, growth, _fall into matter_, admixture with other languages,\r\nmaturity, decay and finally death,(454) so the primitive speech of the\r\nmost civilized Atlantean races—that language, which is referred to as\r\nRâkshasî Bhâshâ, in old Sanskrit works—decayed and almost died out. While\r\nthe “cream” of the Fourth Race gravitated more and more toward the apex of\r\nphysical and intellectual evolution, thus leaving as an heirloom to the\r\nnascent Fifth (the Âryan) Race the inflectional, highly developed\r\nlanguages, the agglutinative decayed and remained as a fragmentary fossil\r\nidiom, now scattered, and nearly limited to the aboriginal tribes of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nIII. _Inflectional speech_: the root of the Sanskrit, very erroneously\r\ncalled the “elder sister” of the Greek, instead of its mother—was the\r\nfirst language, now the mystery tongue of the Initiates, of the Fifth\r\nRace. The “Semitic” languages are the bastard descendants of the first\r\nphonetic corruptions of the eldest children of the early Sanskrit. The\r\nOccult Doctrine admits of no such divisions as the Âryan and the Semite,\r\nand accepts even the Turanian with ample reservations. The Semites,\r\nespecially the Arabs, are later Âryans—degenerate in spirituality and\r\nperfected in materiality. To these belong all the Jews and the Arabs. The\r\nformer are a tribe descended from the Chandâlas of India, the outcasts,\r\nmany of them ex‐Brâhmans, who sought refuge in Chaldæa, in Scinde, and\r\nAria (Iran), and were truly born from their father A‐Bram (No‐Brâhman)\r\nsome 8,000 years B.C. The latter, the Arabs, are the descendants of those\r\nÂryans who would not go into India at the time of the dispersion of\r\nnations, some of whom remained on the borderlands thereof, in Afghanistan\r\nand Kabul(455) and along the Oxus, while others penetrated into and\r\ninvaded Arabia. But this was when Africa had already been raised as a\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nWe have meanwhile to follow, as closely as limited space will permit, the\r\ngradual evolution of the now truly human species. It is in the suddenly\r\narrested evolution of certain sub‐races, and their forced and violent\r\ndiversion into the purely animal line by artificial cross‐breeding, truly\r\nanalogous to the hybridization which we have now learned to utilize in the\r\nvegetable and animal kingdoms, that we have to look for the origin of the\r\nanthropoids.\r\n\r\nIn these red‐haired and hair‐covered monsters, the fruit of the unnatural\r\nconnection between men and animals, the “Lords of Wisdom” did not\r\nincarnate, as we see. Thus through a long series of transformations due to\r\nunnatural cross‐breeding—unnatural “sexual selection”—originated in due\r\ncourse of time the lowest specimens of humanity; while further bestiality\r\nand the fruit of their first animal efforts of reproduction begat a\r\nspecies which developed into mammalian apes ages later.(456)\r\n\r\nAs to the separation of sexes, it did not occur suddenly, as one may\r\nthink. Nature proceeds slowly in whatever she does.\r\n\r\n37. THE ONE(457) BECAME TWO; ALSO ALL THE LIVING AND CREEPING THINGS THAT\r\nWERE STILL ONE, GIANT FISH, BIRDS AND SERPENTS WITH SHELL‐HEADS.\r\n\r\nThis relates evidently to the so‐called age of amphibious reptiles, during\r\nwhich Science denies that man existed! But what could the Ancients know of\r\nantediluvian prehistoric animals and monsters? Nevertheless, in Book VI of\r\nthe Commentaries is found a passage which, freely translated, says:\r\n\r\n_When the Third separated and fell into sin by breeding men‐animals, these\r\n[the animals] became ferocious, and men and they mutually destructive.\r\nTill then, there was no sin, no life taken. After [the separation] the\r\nSatya [Yuga] was at an end. The eternal spring became constant change and\r\nseasons succeeded. Cold forced men to build shelters and devise clothing.\r\nThen man appealed to the superior Fathers [the higher Gods or Angels]. The\r\nNirmânakâyas,  of the Nâgas, the wise Serpents and Dragons of Light, came,\r\nand the precursors of the Enlightened [the Buddhas]. Divine Kings\r\ndescended and taught men sciences and arts, for man could live no longer\r\nin the first land [Âdi‐Varsha, the Eden of the first Races], which had\r\nturned into a white frozen corpse._\r\n\r\nThe above is suggestive. We will see what can be inferred from this brief\r\nstatement. Some may incline to think that there is more in it than is\r\napparent at first sight.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdens, Serpents, And Dragons.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhence the idea, and the true meaning of the term “Eden”? Christians will\r\nmaintain that the Garden of Eden is the holy Paradise, the place\r\n_desecrated by the sin_ of Adam and Eve; the Occultist will deny this\r\ndead‐letter interpretation, and show the reverse. One need not believe in\r\nthe _Bible_ and see in it divine revelation, to say that this ancient\r\nbook, if read esoterically, is based upon the same universal traditions as\r\nthe other ancient scriptures. What Eden was is partially shown in _Isis\r\nUnveiled_, where it is said that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Garden of Eden as a locality is no myth at all; it belongs to\r\n    those landmarks of history which occasionally disclose to the\r\n    student that the _Bible_ is not all mere allegory. “Eden, or the\r\n    Hebrew גן עדן, Gan‐Eden, meaning the Park or the Garden of Eden,\r\n    is an archaic name of the country watered by the Euphrates and its\r\n    many branches, from Asia and Armenia to the Erythraian sea.”(458)\r\n    In the Chaldæan _Book of Numbers_, its location is designated in\r\n    numerals, and in the cypher Rosicrucian manuscript, left by Count\r\n    St. Germain, it is fully described. In the Assyrian _Tablets_ it\r\n    is rendered Gan‐duniyas. “Behold,” say the אלהִם, Elohim, of\r\n    _Genesis_, “the man is become as one of us.” The Elohim may be\r\n    accepted in one sense for _gods_ or powers, and in another for\r\n    Aleim, or priests—the hierophants initiated into the good and evil\r\n    of this world; for there was a college of priests called the\r\n    Aleim, while the head of their caste, or the chief of the\r\n    hierophants, was known as Java‐Aleim. Instead of becoming a\r\n    neophyte, and gradually obtaining his esoteric knowledge through a\r\n    regular initiation, an Adam, or Man, uses his intuitional\r\n    faculties and, prompted by the serpent—_Woman_ and Matter—tastes\r\n    of the Tree of Knowledge, the Esoteric or Secret Doctrine,\r\n    unlawfully. The priests of Hercules, or Mel‐karth, the “Lord” of\r\n    the Eden, all wore “coats of skin.” The text says: “And Java‐Aleim\r\n    made for Adam and his wife, כתנותעור. Chitonuth‐our.” The first\r\n    Hebrew word, Chiton, is the Greek Χιτὼν (Chitôn). It became a\r\n    Slavonic word by adoption from the _Bible_, and means a _coat_, an\r\n    upper garment.\r\n\r\n    Though containing the same substratum of esoteric truth as does\r\n    every early Cosmogony, the Hebrew Scripture wears on its face the\r\n    marks of a double origin. Its _Genesis_ is purely a reminiscence\r\n    of the Babylonian captivity. The names of places, men, and even\r\n    objects, can be traced from the original text to the Chaldæans and\r\n    the Akkadians, the progenitors and Âryan instructors of the\r\n    former. It is strongly contested that the Akkad tribes of Chaldæa,\r\n    Babylonia and Assyria were in any way cognate with the Brâhmans of\r\n    Hindûstan; but there are more proofs in favour of this opinion\r\n    than otherwise. The Shemite or Assyrian ought, perchance, to have\r\n    been called the Turanian, and the Mongolians have been denominated\r\n    Scyths. But if the Akkadians ever existed, otherwise than in the\r\n    imagination of some Philologists and Ethnologists, they certainly\r\n    would never have been a Turanian tribe, as some Assyriologists\r\n    have striven to make us believe. They were simply emigrants on\r\n    their way to Asia Minor from India, the cradle of humanity, and\r\n    their sacerdotal adepts tarried to civilize and initiate a\r\n    barbarian people. Halévy proved the fallacy of the Turanian mania\r\n    in regard to Akkadian people, and other scientists have proved\r\n    that the Babylonian civilization was neither born nor developed in\r\n    that country. It was imported from India, and the importers were\r\n    Brâhmanical Hindûs.(459)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now, ten years after this was written, we find ourselves corroborated\r\nby Professor Sayce, who says in his first Hibbert Lecture that the culture\r\nof the Babylonian city Eridu was of “foreign importation.” It came from\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Much of the theology was borrowed by the Semites from the non‐\r\n    Semitic Akkadians or Proto‐Chaldæans, whom they supplanted, and\r\n    whose local cults they had neither the will nor the power to\r\n    uproot. Indeed, throughout a long course of ages the two races,\r\n    Semites and Akkadians, lived side by side, their notions and\r\n    worship of the gods blending insensibly together.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, the Akkadians are called “non‐Semitic,” as we had insisted they were\r\nin _Isis Unveiled_, which is another corroboration. Nor are we less right\r\nin always maintaining that the Jewish biblical history was a compilation\r\nof _historical_ facts, arranged from other people’s history in Jewish\r\ngarb—_Genesis_ excluded, which is Esotericism pure and simple. But it is\r\nreally from the Euxine to Kashmir, and beyond, that Science has to search\r\nfor the cradle—or rather one of the chief cradles—of mankind and the sons\r\nof Ad‐ah; especially in after times, when the Garden of Ed‐en on the\r\nEuphrates became the College of the Astrologers and Magi, the Aleim.\r\n\r\nBut this College and this Eden belong to the Fifth Race, and are simply a\r\nfaint reminiscence of the Âdi‐Varsha, of the primeval Third Race. What is\r\nthe etymological meaning of the word Eden? In Greek it is ἡδονὴ,\r\nsignifying “voluptuousness.” In this aspect it is no better than the\r\nOlympus of the Greeks, Indra’s Heaven, Svarga, on Mount Meru, and even the\r\nParadise full of Houris, promised by Mahomet to the faithful. The Garden\r\nof Eden was never the property of the Jews, for China, which can hardly be\r\nsuspected of having known anything of the Jews 2,000 B.C., had such a\r\nprimitive Garden in Central Asia inhabited by the “Dragons of Wisdom,” the\r\nInitiates. And according to Klaproth, the hieroglyphical chart copied from\r\na Japanese Cyclopædia in the book of _Foĕ‐kouĕ‐ki_(460) places its “Garden\r\nof Wisdom” on the Plateau of Pamir between the highest peaks of the\r\nHimâlayan ranges; and, describing it as the culminating point of Central\r\nAsia, shows the four rivers—Oxus, Indus, Ganges, and Silo—flowing from a\r\ncommon source, the “Lake of the Dragons.”\r\n\r\nBut this is not the Genetic Eden; nor is it the Kabalistical Garden of\r\nEden. For the former—Eden Illa‐ah—means in one sense Wisdom, a state like\r\nthat of Nirvâna, a Paradise of Bliss; while in another sense it refers to\r\nIntellectual Man himself, the container of the Eden in which grows the\r\nTree of Knowledge of good and evil; man being the Knower thereof.\r\n\r\nRenan and Barthélemy St. Hilaire, basing themselves “on the most solid\r\ninductions,” think it impossible to doubt any longer, and both place the\r\ncradle of humanity “in the region of the Timaus.” Finally, the _Journal\r\nAsiatique_(461) concludes that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    All the traditions of the human race gathering its primitive\r\n    families at the region of their birth‐place, show them to us\r\n    grouped around the countries where Jewish tradition places the\r\n    Garden of Eden; where the Âryans [Zoroastrians] established their\r\n    Airyana Vaêjô or the Meru [?]. They are hemmed in to the North by\r\n    the countries which join Lake Aral, and to the South by Baltistan,\r\n    or Little Tibet. Everything concurs in proving that there was the\r\n    abode of that primitive humanity to which we have to be traced.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat “primitive humanity” was in its Fifth Race, when the “Four‐mouthed\r\nDragon,” the lake, of which very few traces are now left, was the abode of\r\nthe “Sons of Wisdom,” the first Mind‐born Sons of the Third Race. Yet it\r\nwas neither the only nor the primitive cradle of humanity, though it was\r\nthe copy of the cradle, verily, of the first thinking _divine_ Man. It was\r\nthe Paradesha, the highland of the first Sanskrit‐speaking people, the\r\nHedone, the country of delight of the Greeks, but it was not the “Bower of\r\nVoluptuousness” of the Chaldæans, for the latter was but the reminiscence\r\nof it; nor again was it there that the “Fall of Man” occurred after the\r\n“separation.” The Eden of the Jews was _copied_ from the Chaldæan _copy_.\r\n\r\nThat the Fall of Man into generation occurred during the earliest portion\r\nof what Science calls the Mesozoic times, or the age of the reptiles, is\r\nevidenced by the bible phraseology concerning the serpent, the nature of\r\nwhich is explained in the _Zohar_. The question is not whether Eve’s\r\nincident with the tempting reptile is allegorical or textual, for no one\r\ncan doubt that it is the former, but to show the antiquity of the\r\nsymbolism on the very face of it, and that it was not a Jewish but a\r\nuniversal idea.\r\n\r\nNow we find in the _Zohar_ a very strange assertion, one that is\r\ncalculated to provoke the reader to merry laughter by its ludicrous\r\nabsurdity. It tells us that the serpent, which was used by Shamaël, the\r\nsupposed Satan, to seduce Eve, was a kind of “flying\r\ncamel”—καμηλόμορφον.(462)\r\n\r\nA “flying camel” is indeed too much for the most liberal‐minded F.R.S.\r\nNevertheless, the _Zohar_, which can hardly be expected to use the\r\nlanguage of a Cuvier, was right in its description; for we find it called\r\nin the old Zoroastrian MSS. Aschmogh, which in the _Avesta_ is represented\r\nas having after the Fall lost its _nature_ and its _name_, and is\r\ndescribed as a huge serpent with a camel’s neck.\r\n\r\nSalverte asserts that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    There are no winged serpents nor veritable dragons....\r\n    Grasshoppers are still called by the Greeks _winged serpents_, and\r\n    this metaphor may have created several narratives on the existence\r\n    of winged serpents.(463)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are none _now_; but there is no reason why they should not have\r\nexisted during the Mesozoic Age; and Cuvier, who has reconstructed their\r\nskeletons, is a witness to “flying camels.” Already, after finding simple\r\nfossils of certain saurians, the great Naturalist has written, that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    If anything can justify the hydras and other monsters, whose\r\n    figures were so often repeated by mediæval historians, it is\r\n    incontestably the Plesiosaurus.(464)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are unaware if Cuvier has added anything in the way of a further _mea\r\nculpa_, but we may well imagine his confusion for all his slanders against\r\narchaic veracity, when he found himself in the presence of a _flying_\r\nsaurian, the Pterodactyl, found in Germany, seventy‐eight feet long, and\r\ncarrying vigorous wings attached to its reptilian body. This fossil is\r\ndescribed as a reptile, the _little fingers of whose hands_ are so\r\nelongated as to bear a long membranous wing. Here, then, the “flying\r\ncamel” of the _Zohar_ is vindicated. For surely, between the long neck of\r\nthe Plesiosaurus and the membranous wing of the Pterodactyl, or still\r\nbetter the Mosasaurus, there is enough scientific probability on which to\r\nbuild a “flying camel,” or a long‐necked dragon. Prof. Cope, of\r\nPhiladelphia, has shown that the Mosasaurus fossil in the chalk was a\r\nwinged serpent of this kind. There are characters in its vertebræ, which\r\nindicate union with the Ophidia rather than with the Lacertilia.\r\n\r\nAnd now to the main question. It is well known that Antiquity has never\r\nclaimed Palæontography and Palæontology among its arts and sciences; and\r\nit never had its Cuviers. Yet on Babylonian tiles, and especially in old\r\nChinese and Japanese drawings, in the oldest Pagodas and monuments, and in\r\nthe Imperial Library at Pekin, many a traveller has seen and recognized\r\nperfect representations of Plesiosauri and Pterodactyls in the multiform\r\nChinese dragons.(465) Moreover, the prophets speak in the _Bible_ of the\r\nflying fiery serpents,(466) and Job mentions the Leviathan.(467) Now the\r\nfollowing questions are put very directly:\r\n\r\nI. How could the ancient nations know anything of the extinct monsters of\r\nthe Carboniferous and Mesozoic times, and even represent and describe them\r\norally and pictorially, unless they had either _seen those monsters\r\nthemselves_ or _possessed descriptions of them in their traditions_; which\r\ndescriptions necessitate _living and intelligent eye‐witnesses_?\r\n\r\nII. And if such eye‐witnesses are once admitted (unless retrospective\r\nclairvoyance is granted), how can humanity and the first palæolithic men\r\nbe no earlier than about the middle of the Tertiary period? We must bear\r\nin mind that most of the men of Science do not allow man to have appeared\r\nbefore the Quaternary period, and thus shut him out completely from the\r\nCainozoic times. Here we have extinct species of animals, which\r\ndisappeared from the face of the Earth millions of years ago, described\r\nby, and known to, nations whose civilization, it is said, could hardly\r\nhave begun a few thousand years ago. How is this? Evidently either the\r\nMesozoic time has to be made to overlap the Quaternary period, or man must\r\nbe made the contemporary of the Pterodactyl and the Plesiosaurus.\r\n\r\nIt does not follow that, because the Occultists believe in and defend\r\nAncient Wisdom and Science, even though winged saurians are called “flying\r\ncamels” in the translations of the _Zohar_, we therefore as readily\r\nbelieve in all the stories which the Middle Ages give us of such dragons.\r\nPterodactyls and Plesiosauri ceased to exist with the bulk of the Third\r\nRace. When, therefore, we are gravely asked by Roman Catholic writers to\r\ncredit Christopher Scherer’s and Father Kircher’s cock‐and‐bull stories of\r\ntheir having seen with their own eyes living fiery and flying dragons,\r\nrespectively in 1619 and 1669, we may be allowed to regard their\r\nassertions as either dreams or fibs.(468) Nor shall we regard otherwise\r\nthan as a “poetical license” the story told of Petrarch, who, while\r\nfollowing one day his Laura in the woods and passing near a cave, is\r\ncredited with having found a dragon, whom he forthwith stabbed with his\r\ndagger and killed, thus preventing the monster from devouring the lady of\r\nhis heart.(469) We would willingly believe the story had Petrarch lived in\r\nthe days of Atlantis, when such antediluvian monsters may still have\r\nexisted. We deny their existence in our present era. The sea‐serpent is\r\none thing, the dragon quite another. The former is denied by the majority\r\nbecause it lives in the very depths of the ocean, is very scarce, and\r\nrises to the surface only when compelled, perhaps, by hunger. Thus keeping\r\ninvisible, it may exist and still be denied. But if there was such a thing\r\nas a dragon of the above description, how could it have ever escaped\r\ndetection? It is a creature contemporary with the earliest Fifth Race, and\r\nexists no more.\r\n\r\nThe reader may enquire why we speak of dragons at all? We answer: firstly,\r\nbecause the knowledge of such animals is a proof of the enormous antiquity\r\nof the human race; and, secondly, to show the difference between the real\r\nzoological meaning of the words “Dragon,” “Nâga,” and “Serpent,” and the\r\nmetaphorical meaning, when used symbolically. The profane reader, who\r\nknows nothing of the mystery language, is likely, whenever he finds one of\r\nthese words mentioned, to accept it literally. Hence, the _quidproquos_\r\nand unjust accusations. A couple of instances will suffice.\r\n\r\n“Sed et Serpens?” Aye: but what was the nature of the serpent? Mystics\r\nintuitionally see in the serpent of _Genesis_ an animal emblem and a high\r\nspiritual essence: a cosmic force, superintelligent, a “great fallen\r\nlight,” a spirit, sidereal, aërial and tellurian at the same time, “whose\r\ninfluence circumambulates the globe” (_qui circumambulat terram_), as De\r\nMirville,(470) a Christian fanatic of the dead‐letter, has it, and which\r\nonly “manifested itself under the physical emblem which agreed the better\r\nwith its moral and intellectual _coils_”—_i.e._, under the ophidian form.\r\n\r\nBut what will Christians make of the Brazen Serpent, the “Divine Healer,”\r\nif the serpent is to be regarded as the emblem of cunning and evil; the\r\n“Evil One” itself? How can the line of demarcation ever be settled, when\r\nit is traced arbitrarily in a sectarian theological spirit? For, if the\r\nfollowers of the Roman Church are taught that Mercury and Æsculapius, or\r\nAsclepios, who are, in truth, one, are “devils and sons of devils,” and\r\nthe wand and serpent of the latter, the “Devil’s wand”; how about the\r\nBrazen Serpent of Moses? Every scholar knows that both the Heathen “wand”\r\nand the Jewish “serpent” are one and the same, namely, the Caduceus of\r\nMercury, son of Apollo‐Python. It is easy to comprehend why the Jews\r\nadopted the ophidian shape for their “seducer.” With them it was purely\r\n_physiological_ and _phallic_; and no amount of casuistical reasoning on\r\nthe part of the Roman Catholic Church can give it another meaning, once\r\nthat the mystery language is well studied, and that the Hebrew scrolls are\r\nread numerically. The Occultists know that the Serpent, the Nâga, and the\r\nDragon have each a septenary meaning; that the Sun, for instance, was the\r\nastronomical and cosmic emblem of the two contrasted Lights and the two\r\nSerpents of the Gnostics, the good and the evil. They also know that, when\r\n_generalized_, the conclusions of both Science and Theology present two\r\nmost ridiculous extremes. For, when the former tells us that it is\r\nsufficient to trace the legends of the serpents to their primal source,\r\nthe astronomical legend, and to meditate seriously on the Sun, the\r\nconqueror of Python, and the celestial Virgin in the Zodiac forcing back\r\nthe devouring Dragon, if we would have the key of all the subsequent\r\nreligious dogmas—it is easy to perceive that, instead of generalizing, the\r\nauthor simply has his eye on Christian religion and _Revelation_. We call\r\nthis the one extreme. We see the other when Theology, repeating the famous\r\ndecision of the Council of Trent, seeks to convince the masses that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    From the fall of man until the hour of his baptism the Devil has\r\n    full power over him, and possesses him _by right_—_diabolum\r\n    dominium et potestatem super homines habere et jure eos\r\n    possidere_.(471)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this Occult Philosophy answers: Prove first the existence of the Devil\r\n_as an entity_, and then we may believe in such congenital possession. A\r\nvery small amount of observation and knowledge of human nature may be\r\nsufficient to prove the fallacy of this theological dogma. Had Satan any\r\nreality, in the objective or even subjective world (in the ecclesiastical\r\nsense), it is the poor Devil who would find himself chronically obsessed\r\nand even possessed by the wicked—hence by the bulk of mankind. It is\r\nhumanity itself, and especially the clergy, headed by the haughty,\r\nunscrupulous and intolerant Roman Church, which has begotten, given birth\r\nto, and reared in love the Evil One. But this is a digression.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The whole world of thought is reproached by the Church with having\r\n    adored the serpent.\r\n\r\n    The whole of humanity burnt incense to it or stoned it. The\r\n    _Zends_ speak of it as do the _Kings_ and _Vedas_, as the _Edda_\r\n    ... and the _Bible_.... Everywhere the sacred serpent [the Nâga]\r\n    has its shrine and its priest; in Rome it is the Vestal who ...\r\n    prepares its meal with the same care that she bestows on the\r\n    sacred fire. In Greece, Æsculapius cannot cure without its\r\n    assistance, and delegates to it his powers. Every one has heard of\r\n    the famous Roman embassy sent by the Senate to the god of medicine\r\n    and its return with the not less famous serpent, which proceeded\r\n    of its own will and by itself toward its master’s temple on one of\r\n    the islands of the Tiber. Not a Bacchante that did not wind it\r\n    [the serpent] in her hair, not an Augur but questioned it with\r\n    care, not a Necromancer whose tombs are free from its presence!\r\n    The Cainites and the Ophites call it Creator, while recognizing,\r\n    as Schelling did, that the serpent is “evil in substance and in\r\n    person.”(472)\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, the author is right, and if one would have a complete idea of the\r\nprestige which the serpent enjoys to our own day, he ought to study the\r\nmatter in India and learn all that is believed about, and still attributed\r\nto, the Nâgas (cobras) in that country; one should also visit the Africans\r\nof Whydah, the Voodoos of Port‐au‐Prince and Jamaica, the Nagals of\r\nMexico, and the Pâ, or Men‐serpents of China, etc. But why wonder that the\r\nserpent is “adored” and at the same time cursed, since we know that from\r\nthe beginning it was a symbol? In every ancient language the word _dragon_\r\nsignified what it now does in Chinese, _long_ or “the being who excels in\r\nintelligence,” and in Greek, δράκων, or “he who sees and watches.”(473) Is\r\nit to the animal of this name that any of these epithets can apply? Is it\r\nnot evident, wherever superstition and oblivion of the primitive meaning\r\nmay have led savages now, that the above qualifications were intended to\r\napply to the human originals, who were symbolized by Serpents and Dragons?\r\nThese originals—called to this day in China the “Dragons of Wisdom”—were\r\nthe first disciples of the Dhyânîs, who were their Instructors; in short,\r\nthe Primitive Adepts of the Third Race, and later, of the Fourth and Fifth\r\nRaces. The name became universal, and no sane man before the Christian era\r\nwould ever have confounded the man and the symbol.\r\n\r\nThe symbol of Chnouphis, or the Soul of the World, writes Champollion:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Is among others that of an enormous serpent standing on human\r\n    legs; this reptile, the emblem of the Good Genius, is a veritable\r\n    Agathodæmon. It is often represented bearded.... This sacred\r\n    animal, identical with the serpent of the Ophites, is found\r\n    engraved on numerous Gnostic or Basilidean stones.... The serpent\r\n    has various heads, but is constantly inscribed with the letters\r\n    ΧΝΟΥΒΙΣ.(474)\r\n\r\n\r\nAgathodæmon was endowed “with the knowledge of good and evil,” _i.e._,\r\nwith Divine Wisdom, for without the latter the former is impossible.(475)\r\nRepeating Jamblichus, Champollion shows him to be:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The deity called Εἰχτῶν [or the Fire of the Celestial Gods—the\r\n    Great Thot‐Hermes],(476) to whom Hermes Trismegistus attributes\r\n    the invention of magic.(477)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “invention of magic”! A strange term to use, as though the unveiling\r\nof the eternal and actual mysteries of Nature could be _invented_! As well\r\nattribute, millenniums hence, the _invention_ instead of the discovery of\r\nradiant matter to Mr. Crookes. Hermes was not the inventor, or even the\r\ndiscoverer, for, as said in the last footnote but one, Thot‐Hermes is a\r\ngeneric name, as is Enoch—Enoïchion, the “inner, spiritual eye”—Nebo, the\r\nprophet and seer, etc. It is not the proper name of any one living man,\r\nbut a generic title of many Adepts. Their connection with the serpent in\r\nsymbolic allegories is due to their enlightenment by the Solar and\r\nPlanetary Gods during the earliest intellectual Race, the Third. They are\r\nall the representative patrons of the Secret Wisdom. Asclepios is the son\r\nof the Sun‐God Apollo, and he is Mercury; Nebo is the son of Bel‐Merodach;\r\nVaivasvata Manu, the great Rishi, is the son of Vivasvat—the Sun or Sûrya,\r\netc. And while, astronomically, the Nâgas along with the Rishis, the\r\nGandharvas, Apsarases, Grâmanîs (or Yakshas, minor Gods), Yâtudhânas and\r\nDevas, are the Sun’s attendants throughout the twelve solar months; in\r\ntheogony, and also in anthropological evolution, they are Gods and\r\nMen—when incarnated in the _Nether_ World. Let the reader be reminded, in\r\nthis connection, of the fact that Apollonius met in Kashmir Buddhist\r\nNâgas. These are neither serpents zoologically, nor yet the Nâgas\r\nethnologically, but “wise men.”\r\n\r\nThe _Bible_, from _Genesis_ to _Revelation_, is but a series of historical\r\nrecords of the great struggle between White and Black Magic, between the\r\nAdepts of the Right Path, the Prophets, and those of the Left, the\r\nLevites, the clergy of the brutal masses. Even the students of Occultism,\r\nthough some of them have more archaic MSS. and direct teaching to rely\r\nupon, find it difficult to draw a line of demarcation between the Sodales\r\nof the Right Path and those of the Left. The great schism that arose\r\nbetween the sons of the Fourth Race, as soon as the first Temples and\r\nHalls of Initiation had been erected under the guidance of the “Sons of\r\nGod,” is allegorized in the Sons of Jacob. That there were two Schools of\r\nMagic, and that the orthodox Levites did not belong to the holy one, is\r\nshown in the words pronounced by the dying Jacob. And here it may be well\r\nto quote a few sentences from _Isis Unveiled_.(478)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The dying Jacob thus describes his sons: “Dan,” he says, “shall be\r\n    a _serpent_ by the way, an _adder_ in the path, that biteth the\r\n    horse‐heels, so that his rider shall fall backwards [_i.e._, he\r\n    will teach candidates _Black_ Magic]. I have waited for thy\r\n    salvation, O Lord!” Of Simeon and Levi the patriarch remarks that\r\n    they “are brethren; instruments of _cruelty_ are in their\r\n    habitations. O my soul, come not thou into their _secret_; unto\r\n    their _assembly_.”(479) Now in the original, the words “their\r\n    secret” read—“their Sod.”(480) And Sod was the name for the great\r\n    Mysteries of Baal, Adonis and Bacchus, who were all Sun‐Gods and\r\n    had serpents for symbols. The Kabalists explain the allegory of\r\n    the fiery serpents by saying that this was the name given to the\r\n    tribe of Levi, to all the Levites, in short, and that Moses was\r\n    the chief of the Sodales.(481)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is to the Mysteries that the original meaning of the “Dragon‐Slayers”\r\nhas to be traced, and the question is fully treated of hereafter.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile it follows that, if Moses was the Chief of the Mysteries, he was\r\nthe Hierophant thereof; and further, if, at the same time, we find the\r\nProphets thundering against the “abominations” of the people of Israël,\r\nthat there were two Schools. “Fiery serpents” was, then, simply the\r\nepithet given to the Levites of the priestly caste, after they had\r\ndeparted from the Good Law, the traditional teachings of Moses, and to all\r\nthose who followed Black Magic. Isaiah, when referring to the “rebellious\r\nchildren” who will have to carry their riches into the lands whence come\r\n“the viper and _fiery_ flying _serpent_,”(482) or Chaldæa and Egypt, whose\r\nInitiates had already greatly degenerated in his day (700 B.C.), meant the\r\nsorcerers of those lands.(483) But these must be carefully distinguished\r\nfrom the “Fiery Dragons of Wisdom” and the “Sons of the Fire‐Mist.”\r\n\r\nIn the _Great Book of the Mysteries_ we are told that:\r\n\r\n_Seven Lords created seven Men; three Lords [Dhyân Chohans or Pitris] were\r\nholy and good, four less heavenly and full of passion.... The Chhâyâs\r\n[phantoms] of the Fathers were as they._\r\n\r\nThis accounts for the differences in human nature, which is divided into\r\nseven gradations of good and evil. There were seven tabernacles ready to\r\nbe inhabited by Monads under seven different Karmic conditions. The\r\nCommentaries explain on this basis the easy spread of evil, as soon as the\r\nhuman Forms had become real men. Some ancient philosophers, however, in\r\ntheir genetical accounts, ignored the seven and gave only four. Thus the\r\nMexican local _Genesis_ has “four _good_ men,” described as the four real\r\nancestors of the human race, “who were neither begotten by the Gods nor\r\nborn of woman”; but whose creation was a wonder wrought by the Creative\r\nPowers, and who were made only after “_three attempts at manufacturing men\r\nhad failed_.” The Egyptians in their theology had only “four Sons of\r\nGod”—whereas in _Pymander_ _seven_ are given—thus avoiding any mention of\r\nthe evil nature of man. When, however, Set from a God sank into Set‐\r\nTyphon, he began to be called the “seventh son”; whence probably arose the\r\nbelief that “the seventh son of the seventh son” is always a natural‐born\r\nmagician—though at first only a _sorcerer_ was meant. Apap, the serpent\r\nsymbolizing evil, is slain by Aker, Set’s serpent;(484) therefore Set‐\r\nTyphon could not be that evil. In the _Book of the Dead_, it is commanded\r\nthat Chapter clxiii should be read “in the presence of a serpent on two\r\nlegs,” which means a high Initiate, a Hierophant, for the discus and ram’s\r\nhorns(485) that adorn his “serpent’s” head in the hieroglyphics of the\r\ntitle of the said chapter, denote this. Over the “serpent” are represented\r\nthe two mystic eyes of Ammon,(486) the hidden “Mystery God.” The above\r\npassages corroborate our assertion, and show what the word “serpent”\r\nreally meant in antiquity.\r\n\r\nBut as to the Nagals and Nargals; whence came the similarity or names\r\nbetween the Indian Nâgas and the American Nagals?\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Nargal was the Chaldæan and Assyrian chief of the Magi [Rab‐\r\n    Mag], and the Nagal was the chief sorcerer of the Mexican Indians.\r\n    Both derive their names from Nergal‐Serezer, the Assyrian god, and\r\n    the Hindû Nâgas. Both have the same faculties and the power to\r\n    have an attendant Dæmon, with whom they identify themselves\r\n    completely. The Chaldæan and Assyrian Nargal kept his Dæmon, in\r\n    the shape of some animal considered sacred, inside the temple; the\r\n    Indian Nagal keeps his wherever he can—in the neighbouring lake,\r\n    or wood, or in the house, in the shape of some household\r\n    animal.(487)\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch similarity cannot be attributed to _coincidence_. A new world is\r\ndiscovered, and we find that, for our forefathers of the Fourth Race, it\r\nwas already an old one; that Arjuna, Krishna’s companion and Chelâ, is\r\nsaid to have descended into Pâtâla, the “antipodes” and therein married\r\nUlûpî,(488) a Nâga, or Nâgî rather, the daughter of the king of the Nâgas,\r\nKauravya.(489)\r\n\r\nAnd now it may be hoped the full meaning of the serpent emblem is proven.\r\nIt is neither that of evil, nor, least of all, that of the devil; but is,\r\nindeed, the ΣΕΜΕΣ ΕΙΛΑΜ ΑΒΡΑΣΑΞ, the “Eternal Sun Abrasax,” the Central\r\nSpiritual Sun of all the Kabalists, represented in some diagrams by the\r\ncircle of Tiphereth.\r\n\r\nAnd here, again, we may quote from our earlier volumes and enter into\r\nfurther explanations.\r\n\r\n\r\n    From this region of unfathomable Depth (Bythos, Aditi, Shekinah,\r\n    the Veil of the Unknown) issues forth a Circle formed of spirals.\r\n    This is Tiphereth; which, in the language of symbolism, means a\r\n    grand Cycle, composed of smaller ones. Coiled within, so as to\r\n    follow the spirals, lies the Serpent—emblem of Wisdom and\r\n    Eternity—the Dual Androgyne; the cycle representing Ennoia, or the\r\n    Divine Mind (a Power which does not create but which must\r\n    assimilate), and the Serpent, the Agathodæmon, the Ophis, the\r\n    _Shadow_ of the Light (non‐eternal, yet the greatest Divine Light\r\n    on our plane). Both were the Logoi of the Ophites; or the Unity as\r\n    Logos manifesting itself as a double principle of Good and\r\n    Evil.(490)\r\n\r\n\r\nWere it Light alone, inactive and absolute, the human mind could not\r\nappreciate nor even realize it. Shadow is that which enables Light to\r\nmanifest itself, and gives it objective reality. Therefore, Shadow is not\r\nevil, but is the necessary and indispensable corollary which completes\r\nLight or Good; it is its _creator_ on Earth.\r\n\r\nAccording to the views of the Gnostics, these two principles are immutable\r\nLight and Shadow; Good and Evil being virtually one and having existed\r\nthrough all eternity, as they will ever continue to exist so long as there\r\nare manifested worlds.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This symbol accounts for the adoration by this sect of the\r\n    Serpent, as the Saviour, coiled either round the sacramental loaf,\r\n    or a Tau (the phallic emblem). As a unity, Ennoia and Ophis are\r\n    the Logos. When separated, one is the Tree of Spiritual Life, the\r\n    other, the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. Therefore, we find\r\n    Ophis urging the first human couple—the material production of\r\n    Ilda‐baoth, but owing its spiritual principle to Sophia‐\r\n    Achamoth—to eat of the forbidden fruit, although Ophis represents\r\n    divine Wisdom.\r\n\r\n    The Serpent, the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and the Tree\r\n    of Life, are all symbols transplanted from the soil of India. The\r\n    Arasa‐maram [?], the banyan tree, so sacred with the Hindûs—since\r\n    Vishnu during one of his incarnations, reposed under its mighty\r\n    shade and there taught human philosophy and sciences—is called the\r\n    Tree of Knowledge and the Tree of Life. Under the protecting\r\n    foliage of this king of the forests, the Gurus teach their pupils\r\n    their first lessons on immortality and initiate them into the\r\n    mysteries of life and death. The Java‐Aleim of the Sacerdotal\r\n    College are said, in the Chaldæan tradition, to have taught the\r\n    sons of men to become like one of them. To the present day Foh‐\r\n    tchou(491) who lives in his Foh‐Maëyu, or the temple of Buddha, on\r\n    the top of the Kouin‐Long‐Sang,(492) the great mountain, produces\r\n    his greatest religious miracles under a tree called in Chinese\r\n    Sung‐Ming‐Shŭ, or the Tree of Knowledge and the Tree of Life, for\r\n    ignorance is death, and knowledge alone gives immortality. This\r\n    marvellous display takes place every three years, when an immense\r\n    concourse of Chinese Buddhists assembles in pilgrimage at the holy\r\n    place.(493)\r\n\r\n\r\nNow it may become comprehensible why the earliest Initiates and Adepts, or\r\nthe “Wise Men,” who are claimed to have been initiated into the Mysteries\r\nof Nature by the Universal Mind, represented by the highest Angels, were\r\nnamed the “Serpents of Wisdom” and “Dragons”; and also how the first\r\nphysiologically complete couples—after being initiated into the Mystery of\r\nHuman Creation through Ophis, the Manifested Logos and the Androgyne, by\r\neating of the fruit of knowledge—gradually began to be accused by the\r\nmaterial spirit of posterity of having _committed sin_, of having\r\ndisobeyed the “Lord God,” and of having been tempted by the Serpent.\r\n\r\nSo little have the first Christians—who despoiled the Jews of their\r\n_Bible_—understood the first four chapters of _Genesis_ in their esoteric\r\nmeaning, that they have never perceived that not only was no sin intended\r\nin this disobedience, but that the “Serpent” was actually the “Lord God”\r\nhimself, who, as the Ophis, the Logos, or the bearer of divine creative\r\nwisdom, taught mankind to become creators in their turn.(494) They never\r\nrealized that the Cross was an evolution from the Tree and the Serpent,\r\nand thus became the _salvation of mankind_. By this it would become the\r\nvery first fundamental symbol of Creative Cause, applying to geometry, to\r\nnumbers, to astronomy, to measure and to animal reproduction. According to\r\nthe _Kabalah_, _the curse on man came with the formation of woman_.(495)\r\nThe circle was separated from its diameter line.\r\n\r\n\r\n    From the possession of the double principle in one, that is, the\r\n    Androgyne condition, the separation of the dual principle was\r\n    made, presenting two opposites, whose destiny it was, for ever\r\n    after, to seek reünion into the original _one_ condition. The\r\n    curse was this, viz., that Nature, impelling the search, evaded\r\n    the desired result by the production of a new being, distinct from\r\n    that reünion or oneness desired, by which the natural longing to\r\n    recover a lost state was and is for ever being cheated. It is by\r\n    this tantalizing process of a continued curse that Nature\r\n    lives.(496)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe allegory of Adam being driven away from the Tree of Life means,\r\nEsoterically, that the newly separated Race abused and dragged down the\r\nmystery of Life into the region of animalism and bestiality. For, as the\r\n_Zohar_ shows, Matronethah—Shekinah, the wife of Metatron symbolically—“is\r\nthe way to the great Tree of Life, the Mighty Tree,” and Shekinah is\r\nDivine Grace. As explained, this Tree reaches the heavenly vale and is\r\nhidden between three mountains (the upper Triad of Principles, in man).\r\nFrom these three mountains, the Tree ascends above (the Adept’s knowledge\r\naspires heavenward), and then redescends below (into the Adept’s Ego on\r\nearth). This Tree is revealed in the day time and is hidden during the\r\nnight, _i.e._, revealed to an enlightened mind and hidden to ignorance,\r\nwhich is night.(497) As says the Commentary:\r\n\r\n_The Tree of the Knowledge of the Good and the Evil grows from the roots\r\nof the Tree of Life._\r\n\r\nBut then also, as the author of _The Source of Measures_ writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the Kabalah it is plainly to be found that the “Tree of Life”\r\n    was the ansated cross in its sexual aspect, and that the “Tree of\r\n    Knowledge” was the separation and the coming together again to\r\n    fulfil the fatal condition. To display this in numbers the values\r\n    of the letters composing the word Otz (עץ), tree, are 7 and 9, the\r\n    seven being the holy feminine number and the nine the number of\r\n    the phallic or male energy. This ansated cross is the symbol of\r\n    the Egyptian _female‐male_, Isis‐Osiris, the germinal principle in\r\n    all forms, based on the primal manifestation applicable in all\r\n    directions and in all senses.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the Kabalistic view of the Western Occultists, and it differs from\r\nthe more philosophical Eastern or Âryan views upon the subject.(498) The\r\nseparation of the sexes was in the programme of Nature and of natural\r\nevolution; and the creative faculty in male and female was a gift of\r\nDivine Wisdom. In the truth of such traditions the whole of Antiquity,\r\nfrom the patrician philosopher to the humblest spiritually inclined\r\nplebeian, has believed. And as we proceed, we may successfully show that\r\nthe _relative_ truth of such legends, if not their absolute\r\nexactness—vouched for by such giants of intellect as were Solon,\r\nPythagoras, Plato, and others—begins to dawn upon more than one modern\r\nScientist. He is perplexed; he stands startled and confused before proofs\r\nthat are being daily accumulated before him; he feels that there is no way\r\nof solving the many historical problems that stare him in the face, unless\r\nhe begins by accepting ancient traditions. Therefore, in saying that we\r\nbelieve absolutely in ancient records and _universal_ legends, we need\r\nhardly plead guilty before the impartial observer, for other and far more\r\nlearned writers, and that too among those who belong to the modern\r\nScientific School, evidently believe in much that the Occultists do—in\r\n“dragons,” for instance, and not only symbolically, but also in their\r\nactual existence at one time.\r\n\r\n\r\n    It would have indeed been a bold step for anyone, some thirty\r\n    years ago, to have thought of treating the public to a collection\r\n    of stories ordinarily reputed fabulous, and of claiming for them\r\n    the consideration due to genuine realities, or to have advocated\r\n    tales, time‐honoured as fictions, as actual facts; and those of\r\n    the nursery as being, in many instances, legends, more or less\r\n    distorted, descriptive of real beings or events. Nowadays it is a\r\n    less hazardous proceeding.(499)\r\n\r\n\r\nThus opens the Introduction to a recent (1886) and most interesting work\r\nby Mr. Charles Gould, called _Mythical Monsters_. He boldly states his\r\nbelief in most of these monsters. He submits that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Many of the so‐called mythical animals, which throughout long ages\r\n    and in all nations have been the fertile subjects of fiction and\r\n    fable, come legitimately within the scope of plain matter‐of‐fact\r\n    Natural History, and that they may be considered, not as the\r\n    outcome of exuberant fancy, but as creatures which really once\r\n    existed, and of which, unfortunately, only imperfect and\r\n    inaccurate descriptions have filtered down to us, probably very\r\n    much refracted, through the mists of time; ... traditions of\r\n    creatures _once coëxisting with man, some of which are so weird\r\n    and terrible as to appear at first sight to be impossible_....\r\n\r\n    For me the major part of those creatures are not chimeras but\r\n    objects of rational study. The dragon, in place of being a\r\n    creature evolved out of the imagination of Âryan man by the\r\n    contemplation of lightning flashing through the caverns which he\r\n    tenanted, as is held by some mythologists, is an animal which once\r\n    lived and dragged its ponderous coils and perhaps flew....\r\n\r\n    To me the specific existence of the unicorn seems not incredible,\r\n    and, in fact, more probable than that theory which assigns its\r\n    origin to a lunar myth.(500)...\r\n\r\n    For my part I doubt the general derivation of myths from “the\r\n    contemplation of the visible workings of external nature.” It\r\n    seems to me easier to suppose that the palsy of time has enfeebled\r\n    the utterance of these oft‐told tales until their original\r\n    appearance is almost unrecognizable, than that _uncultured savages\r\n    should possess powers of imagination and poetical invention far\r\n    beyond those enjoyed by the most instructed nations of the present\r\n    day_; less hard to believe that these wonderful stories of gods\r\n    and demigods, of giants and dwarfs, of dragons and monsters of all\r\n    descriptions are _transformations_ than to believe them to be\r\n    _inventions_.(501)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is shown by the same Geologist that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Palæontologists have successively traced back the existence of man\r\n    to periods variously estimated at from _thirty thousand to one\r\n    million_ years—to periods when he coëxisted with animals which\r\n    have long since become extinct.(502)\r\n\r\n\r\nThese animals, “weird and terrible,” were, to give a few instances: (1)\r\nThe genus Cidastes, whose huge bones and vertebræ show them to have\r\nattained a length of nearly two hundred feet. The remains of such\r\nmonsters, no less than ten in number, were seen by Professor Marsh in the\r\nMauvaises Terres of Colorado, strewn upon the plains. (2) The Titanosaurus\r\nMontanus, reaching fifty or sixty feet in length. (3) The Dinosaurians, in\r\nthe Jurassic beds of the Rocky Mountains, of still more gigantic\r\nproportions. (4) The Atlantosaurus Immanis, a femur of which alone is over\r\nsix feet in length, and which would be thus over one hundred feet in\r\nlength. But even yet the line has not been reached, and we hear of the\r\ndiscovery of remains of such titanic proportions as to possess a thigh‐\r\nbone over twelve feet in length!(503) Then we read of the monstrous\r\nSivatherium in the Himâlayas, the four‐horned stag, as large as an\r\nelephant, and exceeding the latter in height; of the gigantic Megatherium;\r\nof colossal flying lizards, Pterodactyli, with crocodile jaws on a duck’s\r\nhead, etc. _All these were coëxistent with man, most probably attacked\r\nman, as man attacked them._ And we are asked to believe that the said man\r\nwas no larger then than he is now! Is it possible to conceive that,\r\nsurrounded in Nature with such monstrous creatures, man, unless himself a\r\ncolossal giant, could have survived, while all his foes have perished? Is\r\nit with his stone hatchet that he had the best of a Sivatherium or a\r\ngigantic flying saurian? Let us always bear in mind that at least one\r\ngreat man of Science, de Quatrefages, sees no good scientific reasons why\r\nman should not have been “contemporaneous with the earliest mammalia and\r\ngo back _as far as the Secondary Period_.”(504)\r\n\r\nThe very conservative Professor Jukes writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It appears that the flying dragons of romance had something like a\r\n    real existence in former ages of the world.(505)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the author goes on to ask.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Does the written history of man, comprising a few thousand years,\r\n    embrace the whole course of his intelligent existence? Or have we\r\n    in the long mythical eras, extending over hundreds of thousands of\r\n    years, and recorded in the chronologies of Chaldæa and China,\r\n    shadowy mementoes of prehistoric man, handed down by tradition,\r\n    and perhaps transported by a few survivors to existing lands, from\r\n    others which, like the fabled Atlantis of Plato, may have been\r\n    submerged, or the scene of some great catastrophe which destroyed\r\n    them with all their civilization?(506)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe few remaining giant animals, such as elephants—themselves smaller than\r\ntheir ancestors the Mastodons—and hippopotami, are the only surviving\r\nrelics, and tend to disappear more entirely every day. But even they have\r\nalready had a few pioneers of their future genus, and have decreased in\r\nsize in the same proportion as men have done. For the remains of a pigmy\r\nelephant, E. Falconeri, were found in the cave deposits of Malta; and the\r\nsame author asserts that they were associated with the remains of pigmy\r\nhippopotami, the former being only two feet six inches high. There is also\r\nthe still existing Hippopotamus (Chœropsis) Liberiensis, “which M. Milne‐\r\nEdwards figures as little more than two feet in height.”(507)\r\n\r\nSceptics may smile and denounce our work as full of nonsense or fairy‐\r\ntales. But by so doing they only justify the wisdom of the Chinese\r\nphilosopher Chuang, who said that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The things that men do know can in no way be compared, numerically\r\n    speaking, to the things that are unknown.(508)\r\n\r\n\r\nThus they laugh only at their own ignorance.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “Sons Of God” And The “Sacred Island.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “legend” given in _Isis Unveiled_(509) in relation to a portion of the\r\nglobe which Science now concedes to have been the cradle of\r\nhumanity—though it was but one of the _seven_ cradles, in truth—runs as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Tradition says, and the records of the _Great Book_ (the _Book of\r\n    Dzyan_) explain, that long before the days of Ad‐am, and his\r\n    inquisitive wife, He‐va, where now are found but salt lakes and\r\n    desolate barren deserts, there was a vast inland sea, which\r\n    extended over Middle Asia, north of the proud Himâlayan range, and\r\n    its western prolongation. In it an island, which, for its\r\n    unparalleled beauty, had no rival in the world, was inhabited by\r\n    the last remnant of the Race which preceded ours.\r\n\r\n\r\n“The last remnant” means the “Sons of Will and Yoga,” who, with a few\r\ntribes, survived the great cataclysm. For it was the Third Race,\r\ninhabiting the great Lemurian Continent, which preceded the veritable and\r\ncomplete human Races—the Fourth and the Fifth. Therefore was it said in\r\n_Isis Unveiled_ that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    This race could live with equal ease in water, air, or fire, for\r\n    it had an unlimited control over the elements. These were the\r\n    “Sons of God”; not those who saw the daughters of men, but the\r\n    real Elohim, though in the oriental _Kabalah_ they have another\r\n    name. It was they who imparted Nature’s most weird secrets to men,\r\n    and revealed to them the ineffable, and now _lost_ “word.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “Island,” according to belief, exists to the present hour, as an oasis\r\nsurrounded by the dreadful wildernesses of the great Gobi Desert—whose\r\nsands “no foot hath crossed in the memory of man.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    This word, which is no word, has travelled once round the globe,\r\n    and still lingers as a far‐off dying echo in the hearts of some\r\n    privileged men. The hierophants of all the Sacerdotal Colleges\r\n    were aware of the existence of this island; but the “word” was\r\n    known only to the Java Aleim (Mahâ Chohan in another tongue), or\r\n    chief Lord of every College, and was passed to his successor only\r\n    at the moment of death. There were many such Colleges, and the old\r\n    classical authors speak of them.\r\n\r\n    There was no communication with the fair island by sea, but\r\n    subterranean passages, known only to the chiefs, communicated with\r\n    it in all directions.(510)\r\n\r\n\r\nTradition asserts, and Archæology accepts the truth of the legend, that\r\nthere is more than one city now flourishing in India, which is built on\r\nseveral other cities, making thus a subterranean city of six or seven\r\nstories high. Delhi is one of them, Allahabad another; examples being\r\nfound even in Europe, _e.g._, in Florence, which is built on several\r\ndefunct Etruscan and other cities. Why, then, could not Ellora, Elephanta,\r\nKarli, and Ajunta have been built over subterranean labyrinths and\r\npassages, as it is claimed? Of course we do not allude to the caves which\r\nare known to every European, whether _de visu_ or by hearsay,\r\nnotwithstanding their enormous antiquity, though that even is disputed by\r\nmodern Archæology; but to a fact, known to the initiated Brâhmans of India\r\nand especially to Yogîs, viz., that there is not a cave‐temple in the\r\ncountry but has its subterranean passages running in every direction, and\r\nthat these underground caves and endless corridors have in their turn\r\n_their_ caves and corridors.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Who can tell whether the lost Atlantis—which is also mentioned in\r\n    the _Secret Book_, but, again, under another name, peculiar to the\r\n    sacred language—did not still exist in those days?—\r\n\r\n\r\nwe went on to ask. It _did_ exist most assuredly, for it was approaching\r\nits greatest days of glory and civilization when the last of the Lemurian\r\ncontinents went down.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The great lost Continent might have, perhaps, been situated south\r\n    of Asia, extending from India to Tasmania.(511) If the\r\n    hypothesis—now so much doubted, and positively denied by some\r\n    learned authors, who regard it as a joke of Plato—is ever\r\n    verified, then, perhaps, will the Scientists believe that the\r\n    description of the God‐inhabited continent was not altogether a\r\n    fable.(512) And they may then perceive that Plato’s guarded hints\r\n    and his attributing the narrative to Solon and the Egyptian\r\n    priests, were but a prudent way of imparting the fact to the\r\n    world, and at the same time, by cleverly combining truth and\r\n    fiction, of disconnecting himself from a story which the\r\n    obligations imposed at Initiation forbade him to divulge.\r\n\r\n    To continue the tradition, we have to add that the class of\r\n    hierophants was divided into two distinct categories;(513) those\r\n    who were instructed by the “Sons of God” of the island, and who\r\n    were initiated in the divine doctrine of pure revelation; and\r\n    others who inhabited the lost Atlantis—if such must be its\r\n    name—and who, being of another race (produced _sexually_ but of\r\n    _divine_ parents), were born with a sight which embraced all\r\n    hidden things, and was independent of both distance and material\r\n    obstacle. In short, they were the Fourth Race of men mentioned in\r\n    the _Popol Vuh_, whose sight was unlimited, and who knew all\r\n    things at once.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn other words, they were the Lemuro‐Atlanteans, the first who had a\r\nDynasty of Spirit‐Kings; not of Manes, or “Ghosts,” as some believe,(514)\r\nbut of actual living Devas, or Demi‐gods or Angels, again, who had assumed\r\nbodies to rule over this Race, and who, in their turn, instructed them in\r\narts and sciences. Only, as these Dhyânîs were Rûpa or material Spirits,\r\nthey were not always good. Their King Thevetat was one of the latter, and\r\nit is under the evil influence of this King‐Demon that the Atlantis‐Race\r\nbecame a nation of wicked “magicians.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    In consequence of this, war was declared, the story of which would\r\n    be too long to narrate; its substance may be found in the\r\n    disfigured allegories of the race of Cain, the giants, and that of\r\n    Noah and his righteous family. The conflict came to an end by the\r\n    submersion of Atlantis, which finds its imitation in the stories\r\n    of the Babylonian and Mosaic flood. The giants and magicians “and\r\n    all flesh died ... and every man.” All except Xisuthrus and Noah,\r\n    who are substantially identical with the great Father of the\r\n    Thlinkithians,(515) who, they say, also escaped in a large boat\r\n    like the Hindû Noah Vaivasvata.\r\n\r\n    If we believe the tradition at all, we have to credit the further\r\n    story that, from the intermarrying of the progeny of the\r\n    hierophants of the island and the descendants of the Atlantean\r\n    Noah, a mixed race of righteous and wicked sprang up. On the one\r\n    side the world had its Enochs, Moseses, various Buddhas, its\r\n    numerous “Saviours,” and great hierophants; on the other hand, its\r\n    “_natural_ magicians” who, through lack of the restraining power\r\n    of proper spiritual enlightenment, ... perverted their gifts to\r\n    evil purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may supplement this by the testimony of some records and traditions. In\r\n_L’Histoire des Vierges: les Peuples et les Continents Disparus_, Louis\r\nJacolliot says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    One of the most ancient legends of India, preserved in the temples\r\n    by oral and written tradition, relates that several hundred\r\n    thousand years ago there existed in the Pacific Ocean an immense\r\n    continent, which was destroyed by geological upheaval, and the\r\n    fragments of which must be sought in Madagascar, Ceylon, Sumatra,\r\n    Java, Borneo, and the principal isles of Polynesia.\r\n\r\n    The high plateaux of Hindûstan and Asia, according to this\r\n    hypothesis, would only have been represented in those distant\r\n    epochs by great islands contiguous to the central continent....\r\n    According to the Brâhmans, this country had attained a high\r\n    civilization, and the peninsula of Hindûstan, enlarged by the\r\n    displacement of the waters, at the time of the grand cataclysm,\r\n    has but continued the chain of the primitive traditions born in\r\n    this place. These traditions give the name of Rutas to the peoples\r\n    which inhabited this immense equinoctial continent, and from their\r\n    speech _was derived the Sanskrit_. The Indo‐Hellenic tradition,\r\n    preserved by the most intelligent population which emigrated from\r\n    the plains of India, also relates the existence of a continent and\r\n    a people to which it gives the name of Atlantis and Atlantides,\r\n    and which it locates in the Atlantic in the northern portion of\r\n    the Tropics.\r\n\r\n    Apart from this fact, the supposition of an ancient continent in\r\n    those latitudes, the vestiges of which may be found in the\r\n    volcanic islands and mountainous surface of the Azores, the\r\n    Canaries and Cape de Verd Islands, is not devoid of geographical\r\n    probability. The Greeks, who, moreover, never dared to pass beyond\r\n    the Pillars of Hercules, on account of their dread of the\r\n    mysterious Ocean, appeared too late in antiquity for the stories\r\n    preserved by Plato to be anything else than an echo of the Indian\r\n    legend. Moreover, when we cast a look on a planisphere, at the\r\n    sight of the islands and islets strewn from the Malayan\r\n    Archipelago to Polynesia, from the Straits of Sunda to Easter\r\n    Island, it is impossible, upon the hypothesis of continents\r\n    preceding those which we inhabit, not to place there the most\r\n    important of all.\r\n\r\n    A religious belief, common to Malacca and Polynesia, that is to\r\n    say, to the two opposite extremes of the Oceanic world, affirms\r\n    “that all these islands once formed two immense countries,\r\n    inhabited by yellow men and black men, always at war; and that the\r\n    gods, wearied with their quarrels, having charged Ocean to pacify\r\n    them, the latter swallowed up the two continents, and, since then,\r\n    it has been impossible to make him give up his captives. Alone,\r\n    the mountain‐peaks and high plateaux escaped the flood, by the\r\n    power of the gods, who perceived too late the mistake they had\r\n    committed.”\r\n\r\n    Whatever there may be in these traditions, and whatever may have\r\n    been the place where a civilization more ancient than that of\r\n    Rome, of Greece, of Egypt, and of India was developed, it is\r\n    certain that this civilization did exist, and it is highly\r\n    important to Science to recover its traces, however feeble and\r\n    fugitive they may be.(516)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Oceanic tradition corroborates the legend given from the “Records of\r\nthe Secret Doctrine.” The war mentioned between the yellow and the black\r\nmen, relates to a struggle between the “Sons of Gods” and the “Sons of\r\nGiants,” or the inhabitants and magicians of Atlantis.\r\n\r\nThe final conclusion of the author, who personally visited all the islands\r\nof Polynesia, and devoted years to the study of the religion, language,\r\nand traditions of nearly all the peoples, is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    As to the Polynesian continent which disappeared at the time of\r\n    the final geological cataclysms, its existence rests on such\r\n    proofs that to be logical we can doubt no longer.\r\n\r\n    The three summits of this continent, the Sandwich Islands, New\r\n    Zealand, Easter Island, are distant from each other from fifteen\r\n    to eighteen hundred leagues, and the groups of intermediate\r\n    islands, Viti (Fiji), Samoa, Tonga, Foutouna (? Foutouha), Ouvea\r\n    (? Oueeha), the Marquesas, Tahiti, Poumoutou (? Pomatou), the\r\n    Gambiers, are themselves distant from these extreme points from\r\n    seven or eight hundred to one thousand leagues.\r\n\r\n    All navigators agree in saying that the extreme and the central\r\n    groups could never have communicated in view of their actual\r\n    geographical position, and with the insufficient means they had at\r\n    hand. It is physically impossible to cross such distances in a\r\n    pirogue ... without a compass, and travel months without\r\n    provisions.\r\n\r\n    On the other hand, the aborigines of the Sandwich Islands, of\r\n    Viti, of New Zealand, of the central groups, of Samoa, Tahiti,\r\n    etc., _had never known each other, had never heard of each other_,\r\n    before the arrival of the Europeans. _And yet each of these people\r\n    maintained that their island had at one time formed part of an\r\n    immense stretch of land which extended towards the West on the\r\n    side of Asia._ And all, brought together, were found to speak the\r\n    same language, to have the same usages, the same customs, the same\r\n    religious belief. And all to the question, “Where is the cradle of\r\n    your race?” for sole response, _extended their hand toward the\r\n    setting sun_.(517)\r\n\r\n\r\nGeographically, this description clashes slightly with the facts in the\r\nSecret Records; but it shows the existence of such traditions, and this is\r\nall one cares for. For, as there is no smoke without fire, so a tradition\r\nmust be based on some approximate truth.\r\n\r\nIn its proper place we will show Modern Science fully corroborating the\r\nabove and other traditions of the Secret Doctrine with regard to the two\r\nlost Continents. The Easter Island relics, for instance, are the most\r\nastounding and eloquent memorials of the primeval giants. They are as\r\ngrand as they are mysterious; and one has but to examine the heads of the\r\ncolossal statues, that have remained unbroken, to recognize at a glance\r\nthe features of the type and character attributed to the Fourth Race\r\ngiants. They seem of one cast though different in features—of a distinctly\r\nsensual type, such as the Atlanteans (the Daityas and “Atalantians”) are\r\nsaid to have had in the Esoteric Hindû books. Compare these with the faces\r\nof some other colossal statues in Central Asia—those near Bamian, for\r\ninstance—the portrait‐statues, tradition tells us, of Buddhas belonging to\r\n_previous_ Manvantaras; of those Buddhas and heroes who are mentioned in\r\nthe Buddhist and Hindû works, as men of fabulous size,(518) the good and\r\nholy brothers of their wicked coüterine brothers generally, just as\r\nRâvana, the giant king of Lankâ, was the brother of Kumbhakarna; all\r\ndescendants of the Gods through the Rishis, and thus, like “Titan and his\r\nenormous brood,” all “Heaven’s first‐born.” These “Buddhas,” though often\r\nspoilt by the symbolical representation of great pendent ears, show a\r\nsuggestive difference, perceived at a glance, in the expression of their\r\nfaces from that of the Easter Island statues. They may be of one race—but\r\nthe former are “Sons of Gods”; the latter the brood of mighty sorcerers.\r\nAll these are reïncarnations however, and, apart from unavoidable\r\nexaggerations in popular fancy and tradition, they are _historical\r\ncharacters_.(519) When did they live? How long ago lived the two Races,\r\nthe Third and Fourth; and how long after did the various tribes of the\r\nFifth begin their strife, the wars between Good and Evil? We are assured\r\nby the Orientalists that chronology is both hopelessly mixed and absurdly\r\nexaggerated in the _Purânas_ and other Hindû Scriptures. We feel quite\r\nprepared to agree with the accusation. But, if Âryan writers have\r\noccasionally allowed their chronological pendulum to swing too far one\r\nway, beyond the legitimate limit of fact; nevertheless, when the distance\r\nof that deviation is compared with the distance of the Orientalists’\r\ndeviation in the opposite direction, moderation will be found on the\r\nBrâhmanical side. It is the Pandit who will, in the long run, be found\r\nmore truthful and nearer to fact than the Sanskritist. The Sanskritist’s\r\ncurtailing—even when proved to have been resorted to in order to fit a\r\npersonal hobby—is regarded by Western public opinion as “a _cautious_\r\nacceptance of facts,” whereas the Pandit is brutally treated in print as a\r\n“_liar_.” But, surely, this is no reason why everyone should be compelled\r\nto see this in the same light! An impartial observer may judge it\r\notherwise. He may either proclaim both unscrupulous historians, or justify\r\nboth, each on his respective ground, and say: Hindû Âryans wrote for their\r\nInitiates, who read truth between the lines; not for the masses. If they\r\ndid mix up events and confuse Ages _intentionally_, it was not with the\r\nview of deceiving any one, but in order to preserve their knowledge from\r\nthe prying eye of the foreigner. But, to him who can count the\r\n_generations_ from the Manus, and the _series of incarnations_ specified\r\nin the cases of some heroes,(520) in the _Purânas_, the meaning and\r\nchronological order are very clear. As for the Western Orientalist, he\r\nmust be excused, on account of his undeniable ignorance of the methods\r\nused by archaic Esotericism.\r\n\r\nBut such existing prejudices will have to give way and disappear very soon\r\nbefore the light of new discoveries. Already Dr. Weber’s and Prof. Max\r\nMüller’s favourite theories—namely, that writing was not known in India,\r\neven in the days of Pânini (!); that the Hindûs had all their arts and\r\nsciences—even to the Zodiac and their architecture (Fergusson)—from the\r\nMacedonian Greeks; these and other such cock‐and‐bull hypotheses, are\r\nthreatened with ruin. It is the ghost of old Chaldæa that comes to the\r\nrescue of truth. In his third Hibbert Lecture (1887) Professor Sayce of\r\nOxford, speaking of newly‐discovered Assyrian and Babylonian cylinders,\r\nrefers at length to Ea, the God of Wisdom, now identified with the Oannes\r\nof Berosus, the half‐man, half‐fish, who taught the Babylonians culture\r\nand the _art of writing_. This Ea, to whom, thanks only to the Biblical\r\nDeluge, an antiquity of hardly 1,500 B.C. had been hitherto allowed, is\r\nnow spoken of in the following terms, to summarize from the Professor:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The city of Ea was Eridu, which stood 6,000 years ago on the\r\n    shores of the Persian Gulf. The name means “the good city,” a\r\n    particularly holy spot, since it was the centre from which the\r\n    earliest Chaldæan civilization made its way to the north. As the\r\n    culture‐god was represented as coming from the sea, it was\r\n    possible that the culture of which Eridu was the seat was of\r\n    foreign importation. We now know that there was intercourse at a\r\n    very early period between Chaldæa and the Sinaitic peninsula, as\r\n    well as with India. The statues discovered by the French at Tel‐\r\n    loh (dating from at latest B.C. 4,000) were made of the extremely\r\n    hard stone known as diorite, and the inscriptions on them stated\r\n    the diorite to have been brought from Magan—_i.e._, the Sinaitic\r\n    peninsula, which was then ruled by the Pharaohs. The statues are\r\n    known to resemble in general style the diorite statue, Kephren,\r\n    the builder of the second Pyramid, while, according to Mr. Petrie,\r\n    the unit of measurement marked on the plan of the city, which one\r\n    of the Tel‐loh figures holds on his lap, is the same as that\r\n    employed by the Pyramid builders. Teak wood has been found at\r\n    Mugheir, or Ur of the Chaldees, although that wood is an Indian\r\n    special product; add to this that an ancient Babylonian list of\r\n    clothing mentions _sindhu_ or “muslin,” explained as “vegetable\r\n    cloth.”(521)\r\n\r\n\r\nMuslin, best known now as Dacca muslin, known in Chaldæa as Hindu\r\n(Sindhu), and teak wood used 4,000 years B.C., and yet the Hindûs, to whom\r\nChaldæa owes its civilization, as has been well proven by Colonel Vans\r\nKennedy, were _ignorant of the art of writing_ before the Greeks taught\r\nthem their alphabet—if, at least, we have to believe Orientalists!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStanza X. The History Of The Fourth Race.\r\n\r\n\r\n    38. The birth of the Fourth (Atlantean) Race. 39. The sub‐races of\r\n    the Fourth Humanity begin to divide and interblend; they form the\r\n    first mixed races of various colours. 40. The superiority of the\r\n    Atlantean over other Races. 41. They fall into sin and beget\r\n    children and monsters. 42. The first germs of anthropomorphism and\r\n    sexual religion. They lose their “third eye.”\r\n\r\n\r\n38. THUS, TWO BY TWO, ON THE SEVEN ZONES, THE THIRD RACE GAVE BIRTH TO THE\r\nFOURTH; THE SURA BECAME A‐SURA.(522)\r\n\r\n39. THE FIRST,(523) ON EVERY ZONE, WAS MOON‐COLOURED;(524) THE SECOND\r\nYELLOW LIKE GOLD; THE THIRD RED; THE FOURTH BROWN, WHICH BECAME BLACK WITH\r\nSIN.(525) THE FIRST SEVEN HUMAN SHOOTS WERE ALL OF ONE COMPLEXION.(526)\r\nTHE NEXT SEVEN,(527) BEGAN MIXING.(528)\r\n\r\nTo understand Shloka 38, it must be read together with the Shlokas of\r\nStanza IX. Up to this point of evolution man belongs more to metaphysical\r\nthan physical Nature. It is only after the so‐called “Fall,” that the\r\nRaces began to develop rapidly into a purely human shape. In order that\r\nthe student may correctly comprehend the full meaning of the Fall—so\r\nmystic and transcendental in its real significance—he must at once be told\r\nthe details which preceded it, seeing that modern Theology has made of the\r\nevent a pivot on which its most pernicious and absurd dogmas and beliefs\r\nare made to turn.\r\n\r\nThe Archaic Commentaries, as the reader may remember, explain that, of the\r\nHost of Dhyânîs, whose turn it was to incarnate as the Egos of the\r\nimmortal, but, _on this plane_, senseless Monads—some “obeyed” (the Law of\r\nEvolution) immediately the men of the Third Race became physiologically\r\nand physically ready, _i.e._, when they had separated into sexes. These\r\nwere those early conscious Beings who, now adding conscious knowledge and\r\nwill to their inherent divine purity, “created” by Kriyâshakti the semi‐\r\ndivine man, who became the Seed on Earth for future Adepts. Those, on the\r\nother hand, who, jealous of their intellectual freedom—unfettered as it\r\nthen was by the bonds of Matter—said: “We can choose, ... we have\r\nwisdom,”(529) and so incarnated far later—these had their first Karmic\r\npunishment prepared for them. They got bodies inferior (physiologically)\r\nto their Astral Models, because their Chhâyâs had belonged to Progenitors\r\nof an inferior degree in the seven Classes. As to those “Sons of Wisdom”\r\nwho “deferred” their incarnation till the Fourth Race, which was already\r\ntainted (physiologically) with sin and impurity, these produced a terrible\r\ncause, the Karmic result of which weighs on them to this day. It was\r\nproduced in themselves, and they became the carriers of that seed of\r\niniquity for æons to come, because the bodies they had to inform had\r\nbecome defiled through their own procrastination.(530)\r\n\r\nThis was the “Fall of the Angels,” owing to their rebellion against Karmic\r\nLaw. The “fall of _man_” was no fall, _for he was irresponsible_. But\r\n“creation” having been invented on the dualistic system as the\r\n“prerogative of God alone”—the legitimate _attribute_ patented by Theology\r\nin the name of an _infinite_ Deity of their own making—the power of\r\nKriyâshakti had to be regarded as “Satanic,” and as a usurpation of divine\r\nrights. Thus, in the light of such narrow views, the foregoing must\r\nnaturally be considered as a terrible slander on man, “created in the\r\nimage of God,” and a still more dreadful blasphemy in the face of the\r\ndead‐letter dogma. “Your doctrine,” the Occultists have already been told,\r\n“makes of man, created out of dust in the likeness of his God, a vehicle\r\nof the Devil, from the first.” “Why do you make of your God a Devil—both,\r\nmoreover, created in _your own_ image?”—is our reply. The Esoteric\r\ninterpretation of the _Bible_, however, sufficiently refutes this\r\nslanderous invention of Theology; the Secret Doctrine must some day become\r\nthe just Karma of the Churches—more anti‐Christian than the representative\r\nassemblies of the most confirmed Materialists and Atheists.\r\n\r\nThe true meaning of the old doctrine of the “Fallen Angels,” in its\r\nanthropological and evolutionary sense, is contained in the _Kabalah_, and\r\nexplains the _Bible_. It is found preëminently in _Genesis_ when the\r\nlatter is read in a spirit of research for truth, with no eye to dogma,\r\nand in no mood of preconception. This is easily proven. In _Genesis_ (vi),\r\nthe “Sons of God”—B’ne Aleim—become enamoured of the daughters of men,\r\nmarry, and reveal to their wives the mysteries unlawfully learnt by them\r\nin Heaven, according to Enoch; and this is the “Fall of the Angels.”(531)\r\nBut what, in reality, is the _Book of Enoch_ itself, from which the author\r\nof _Revelation_ and even the St. John of the Fourth Gospel(532) have so\r\nprofusely quoted? Simply a _Book of Initiation_, giving out in allegory\r\nand cautious phraseology the programme of certain Archaic Mysteries\r\nperformed in the _inner_ Temples. The author of the _Sacred Mysteries\r\namong the Mayas and Quichés_ very justly suggests that the so‐called\r\n“Visions” of Enoch relate to his (Enoch’s) experience at Initiation, and\r\nwhat he learned in the Mysteries; while he very erroneously states his\r\nopinion that Enoch had learned them before being converted to Christianity\r\n(! !); furthermore, he believes that this book was written “at the\r\nbeginning of the Christian era, when ... the customs and religion of the\r\nEgyptians fell into decadency”! This is hardly possible, since Jude, in\r\nhis Epistle,(533) quotes from the _Book of Enoch_; and, therefore, as\r\nArchbishop Laurence, the translator of the _Book of Enoch_ from the\r\nEthiopic version, remarks, it “could not have been the production of a\r\nwriter who lived after ... or was even coëval with” the writers of the\r\n_New Testament_, unless, indeed, Jude and the Gospels, and all that\r\nfollows, were also a production of the already established Church—which,\r\nsome critics say, is not impossible. But we are now concerned with the\r\n“Fallen Angels” of Enoch, rather than with Enoch himself.\r\n\r\nIn Indian exotericism, these Angels (Asuras) are also denounced as the\r\n“enemies of the Gods”; those who oppose sacrificial worship offered to the\r\nDevas. In Christian Theology they are broadly referred to as the “Fallen\r\nSpirits,” the heroes of various conflicting and contradictory legends,\r\ngathered from Pagan sources. The _coluber tortuosus_, the “tortuous\r\nsnake”—a qualification said to have originated with the Jews—had quite\r\nanother meaning before the Roman Church distorted it; among others, _a\r\npurely astronomical_ signification.\r\n\r\nThe “Serpent” fallen from on high (_deorsum fluens_) was credited with the\r\npossession of the Keys of the Empire of the Dead (τοῦ θανάτου ἀρχή) to the\r\nday when Jesus saw it fall “as lightning ... from heaven,”(534)\r\nnotwithstanding the Roman Catholic interpretation of “_cadebat ut\r\nfulgur_.” It means indeed that even “the devils are subject” to the\r\nLogos—who is Wisdom, but at the same time, as the opponent of ignorance,\r\nSatan or Lucifer. This remark refers to divine Wisdom falling like\r\nlightning on, and so quickening, the intellects of those who fight the\r\ndevils of ignorance and superstition. Up to the time when Wisdom, in the\r\nshape of the incarnating Spirits of Mahat, descended from on high to\r\nanimate and call the Third Race to real conscious life—Humanity, if it can\r\nbe so called in its animal, senseless state, was of course doomed to\r\n_moral_ as well as to physical death. The Angels _fallen into generation_\r\nare referred to metaphorically as Serpents and Dragons of Wisdom. On the\r\nother hand, regarded in the light of the Logos, the Christian Saviour,\r\nlike Krishna, whether as man or Logos, may be said to have saved those who\r\nbelieved in the Secret Teachings, from “eternal death,” and to have\r\nconquered the Kingdom of Darkness, or Hell, as every Initiate does. This\r\nis the human, terrestrial form of the Initiates, and also—because the\r\nLogos is Christos—that “principle” of our inner nature which develops in\r\nus into the Spiritual Ego—the Higher Self—formed of the indissoluble union\r\nof Buddhi, the sixth, and the spiritual efflorescence of Manas, the fifth\r\n“principle.”(535) “The Logos is passive Wisdom in Heaven and conscious,\r\nself‐active Wisdom on Earth,” we are taught. It is the Marriage of the\r\n“Heavenly Man” with the “Virgin of the World,” or Nature, as described in\r\n_Pymander_; the result of which is their progeny—immortal man. It is this\r\nwhich is called in St. John’s _Revelation_(536) the marriage of the Lamb\r\nwith his Bride. This “wife” is now identified with the Church of Rome\r\nowing to the arbitrary interpretations of her votaries. But they seem to\r\nforget that her “linen” may be “clean and white” _outwardly_, like the\r\n“whited sepulchre,” but that the rottenness she is inwardly filled with,\r\nis not the “righteousness of saints,”(537) but rather the blood of the\r\nsaints she has “slain upon the earth.”(538) Thus the remark made by the\r\ngreat Initiate, in _Luke_—referring allegorically to the ray of\r\nenlightenment and reason, _falling like lightning_ from on high into the\r\nhearts and minds of the converts to the old Wisdom‐Religion, then\r\npresented in a new form by the wise Galilean Adept(539)—was distorted out\r\nof all recognition, as was also his own personality, and made to fit in\r\nwith one of the most cruel and the most pernicious of all theological\r\ndogmas.\r\n\r\nBut if Western Theology alone holds the patent and copyright of Satan—in\r\nall the dogmatic horror of that fiction—other nationalities and religions\r\nhave committed equal errors in their misinterpretation of a tenet, which\r\nis one of the most profoundly philosophical and ideal conceptions of\r\nancient thought. They have both disfigured, and hinted at, the correct\r\nmeaning of it in their numerous allegories on the subject. Nor have the\r\nsemi‐esoteric dogmas of Paurânic Hindûism failed to evolve very suggestive\r\nsymbols and allegories concerning the rebellious and fallen Gods. The\r\n_Purânas_ teem with them; and we find a direct hint at the truth in the\r\nfrequent allusions of Parâshara, in the _Vishnu Purâna_, to all those\r\nRudras, Rishis, Asuras, Kumâras and Munis, who have _to be born in every\r\nage_—to reïncarnate in every Manvantara. This, Esoterically, is equivalent\r\nto saying that the “Flames” born of the Universal Mind, or Mahat, owing to\r\nthe mysterious workings of Karmic Will and the impulse of Evolutionary\r\nLaw, had—without any gradual transition—landed on this Earth, after\r\nhaving, as in _Pymander_, broken through the “Seven Circles of Fire,” or,\r\nin short, the seven intermediate Worlds.\r\n\r\nThere is an Eternal Cyclic Law of Re‐births, and the series is headed at\r\nevery new Manvantaric Dawn by those who have enjoyed their rest from\r\nreïncarnations in previous Kalpas for incalculable Æons—by the highest and\r\nthe earliest Nirvânîs. It was the turn of these “Gods” to incarnate in the\r\npresent Manvantara; hence their presence on Earth, and the ensuing\r\nallegories; hence, also, the perversion of the original meaning.(540) The\r\nGods who had “_fallen_ into generation,” whose mission it was to complete\r\n_Divine_ Man, are found represented later on as Demons, Evil Spirits, and\r\nFiends, at feud and war with Gods, or the irresponsible agents of the one\r\nEternal Law. But no conception of such creatures as the Devils and the\r\nSatan of the Christian, Jewish, and Mahommedan religions was ever intended\r\nby these thousand and one Âryan allegories.(541)\r\n\r\nThe true Esoteric view about “Satan,” the opinion held on this subject by\r\nthe whole of philosophic antiquity, is admirably brought out in an\r\nAppendix, entitled “The Secret of Satan,” to the second edition of Dr. A.\r\nKingsford’s _Perfect Way_.(542) No better and clearer indication of the\r\ntruth could be offered to the intelligent reader, and it is therefore\r\nquoted here at some length:\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. And on the seventh day [seventh creation of the Hindûs],(543)\r\n    there went forth from the presence of God a _mighty Angel_, full\r\n    of wrath and consuming, and God gave him the dominion of the\r\n    outermost sphere.(544)\r\n\r\n    2. Eternity brought forth Time; the Boundless gave birth to Limit;\r\n    Being descended into generation.(545)\r\n\r\n    4. _Among the Gods is none like unto him_, into whose hands are\r\n    committed the kingdoms, the power and the glory of the worlds:\r\n\r\n    5. Thrones and empires, the dynasties of kings,(546) the fall of\r\n    nations, the birth of churches, the triumphs of Time.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor, as is said in Hermes:\r\n\r\n\r\n    20. Satan is the door‐keeper of the _Temple of the King_; he\r\n    standeth in Solomon’s porch; he holdeth _the Keys of the\r\n    Sanctuary_;\r\n\r\n    21. That no man may enter therein save the anointed, having the\r\n    arcanum of Hermes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese suggestive and majestic verses had reference, with the ancient\r\nEgyptians and other civilized peoples of antiquity, to the _creative and\r\n__ generative Light of the Logos_—Horus, Brahmâ, Ahura Mazda, etc., as\r\nprimeval manifestations of the Ever‐unmanifested Principle, whether called\r\nAin Suph, Parabrahman, or Zeruâna Akerne, or Boundless Time, Kâla—but the\r\nmeaning is now degraded in the _Kabalah_. The “Anointed”—who has the\r\nsecrets and mysteries of Hermes, or Budha, Wisdom, and who alone is\r\nentrusted with the “Keys of the Sanctuary,” the Womb of Nature, in order\r\nto fructify it and call to active life and being the whole Kosmos—has\r\nbecome, with the Jews, Jehovah, the “God of Generation” on the Lunar\r\nMountain—Sinai, the Mountain of the Moon (Sin). The “Sanctuary” has become\r\nthe “Holy of Holies,” and the arcanum has been anthropomorphized, and\r\n“phallicized,” and dragged down into Matter, indeed. Hence arose the\r\nnecessity of making of the “Dragon of Wisdom,” the “Serpent” of _Genesis_;\r\nof the conscious God who needed a body to clothe his too subjective\r\ndivinity, Satan. But the “innumerable incarnations of Spirit,” and “the\r\nceaseless pulse and current of Desire,”(547) refer, the first, to our\r\ndoctrine of Karmic and Cyclic Rebirths, the second—to Erôs, not the later\r\nGod of material, physiological love, but to the Divine Desire in the Gods,\r\nas well as in all Nature, to create and give life to Beings. This, the\r\nRays of the one “Dark,” because invisible and incomprehensible, “Flame”\r\ncould achieve only by themselves descending into Matter. Therefore, as\r\ncontinued in the Appendix:\r\n\r\n\r\n    12. Many names hath God given him [Satan], names of mystery,\r\n    secret and terrible.\r\n\r\n    13. ... The Adversary, because Matter opposeth Spirit, and Time\r\n    accuseth even the saints of the Lord.\r\n\r\n    28. Stand in awe of him, and sin not: speak his name with\r\n    trembling....\r\n\r\n    29. For Satan is the magistrate of the Justice of God [Karma]; he\r\n    beareth the balance and the sword.\r\n\r\n    31. For to him are committed _Weight and Measure and Number_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompare the last sentence with what the Rabbi, who explains the Kabalah to\r\nthe Prince in the Book of _Al Chazari_, says, and it will be found that\r\nWeight and Measure and Number are, in the _Sepher Jetzirah_, the\r\nattributes of the Sephiroth (the three Sephrim, or figures, ciphers),\r\ncovering the whole collective number of 10; and that the Sephiroth are the\r\ncollective Adam Kadmon, the “Heavenly Man” or the Logos. Thus Satan and\r\nthe Anointed were identified in ancient thought. Therefore:\r\n\r\n\r\n    33. Satan is the minister of God, Lord of the seven mansions of\r\n    Hades, the Angel of the manifest Worlds.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe seven Lokas, or Saptaloka, of the Earth with the Hindûs; for Hades, or\r\nthe Limbo of Illusion, of which Theology makes a region bordering on Hell,\r\n_is simply our Globe_, the Earth, and thus Satan is called the “Angel of\r\nthe _manifest_ Worlds.”\r\n\r\nIt is “Satan who is the God of our planet and _the only_ God,” and this\r\nwithout any metaphorical allusion to its wickedness and depravity. For he\r\nis one with the Logos.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The first and “eldest of the gods,” in the order of microcosmic\r\n    [divine] evolution, Saturn (Satan) [astronomically] is the\r\n    _seventh and last_ in the order of macrocosmic emanation, being\r\n    the circumference of the Kingdom of which Phœbus [the Light of\r\n    Wisdom, also the Sun] is the centre.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Gnostics were right, then, in calling the Jewish God an “Angel of\r\nMatter,” or he who breathed (conscious) life into Adam, and whose Planet\r\nwas Saturn.\r\n\r\n\r\n    34. And God hath put a girdle about his loins [the rings of\r\n    Saturn], and the name of the girdle is Death.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Anthropogony this “girdle” is the human body with its two lower\r\nprinciples. These three die, while the innermost Man is immortal. And now\r\nwe approach the _secret_ of Satan.\r\n\r\n\r\n    37. ... Upon Satan only _is the shame of generation_.\r\n\r\n    38. He hath lost his virginal estate [so hath the Kumâra, by\r\n    incarnating]: _uncovering heavenly secrets_, he hath entered into\r\n    bondage.\r\n\r\n    39. He encompasseth with bonds and limits all things....\r\n\r\n    42. Twain are the armies of God: in heaven the hosts of Michael;\r\n    in the abyss [the manifested world] the legions of Satan.\r\n\r\n    43. These are the Unmanifest and the Manifest; the free and the\r\n    bound [in Matter]; the virginal and the fallen.\r\n\r\n    44. And both are the ministers of the Father, fulfilling the Word\r\n    divine.\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore:\r\n\r\n\r\n    55. Holy and venerable is the Sabbath of God: _blessed and\r\n    sanctified is the name of the Angel of Hades_ [Satan].\r\n\r\n\r\nFor:\r\n\r\n\r\n    41. The glory of Satan is the shadow of the Lord [God in the\r\n    manifested World]: the throne of Satan is the footstool of Adonai\r\n    [the whole Kosmos].\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Church, therefore, curses Satan, it curses the Kosmic reflection\r\nof God; it anathematizes God made manifest in Matter or in the objective;\r\nit maledicts God, or the ever‐incomprehensible Wisdom, revealing itself as\r\nLight and Shadow, Good and Evil in Nature, in the only manner\r\ncomprehensible to the limited intellect of Man.\r\n\r\nThis is the true philosophical and metaphysical interpretation of Samael,\r\nor Satan, the Adversary in the _Kabalah_; the same tenets and spirit being\r\nfound in the allegorical interpretations of every other ancient religion.\r\nThis philosophical view does not interfere, however, with the historical\r\nrecords connected with it. We say “historical,” because allegory and\r\nmythical ornamentation round the kernel of tradition, in nowise prevent\r\nthat kernel being a record of real events. Thus, the _Kabalah_, repeating\r\nthe time‐honoured revelations of the once universal history of our Globe\r\nand the evolution of its Races, has presented it under the legendary form\r\nof the various records which have formed the _Bible_. Its historical\r\nfoundation, in however imperfect a form, is now offered in these pages\r\nfrom the Secret Doctrine of the East; and thus the allegorical and\r\nsymbolical meaning of the Serpent of _Genesis_ is found explained by the\r\n“Sons of Wisdom”—or Angels from higher Spheres, though all and each\r\npertain to the Kingdom of Satan, or Matter—revealing to men the mysteries\r\nof Heaven. Hence, also, all the so‐called myths of the Hindû, Grecian,\r\nChaldæan, and Jewish Pantheons are found to be built on fact and truth.\r\nThe Giants of _Genesis_ are the historical Atlanteans of Lankâ, and the\r\nGreek Titans.\r\n\r\nWho can forget that Troy was once upon a time proclaimed a myth, and Homer\r\na non‐existent personage, while the existence of such cities as\r\nHerculaneum and Pompeii was denied, and attributed to mere fairy legends?\r\nYet Schliemann has proved that Troy did really exist, and the two latter\r\ncities, though buried for long ages under the Vesuvian lava, have had\r\ntheir resurrection day, and live again on the surface of the Earth. How\r\nmany more cities and localities called “fabulous” are on the list of\r\nfuture discoveries, how many more personages regarded as mythical(548)\r\nwill one day become historical, those alone can tell who read the decrees\r\nof Fate in the Astral Light.\r\n\r\nAs the tenets of the Eastern Doctrine, however, have always been kept\r\nsecret, and as the reader can hardly hope to be shown the original texts\r\nunless he becomes an accepted disciple, let the Greek and Latin scholar\r\nturn to the original texts of Hermetic literature. Let him, for instance,\r\nread carefully the opening pages of the _Pymander_ of Hermes Trismegistus,\r\nand he will see our doctrines corroborated therein, however veiled its\r\ntext. There also he will find the evolution of the Universe, of our Earth,\r\ncalled “Nature” in _Pymander_, as of everything else, from the “Moyst\r\nPrinciple,” or the great Deep, Father‐Mother—the first differentiation in\r\nthe manifested Kosmos. First the “Universal Mind,” which the hand of the\r\nChristian translator has metamorphosed in the earliest renderings into\r\nGod, the Father; then the “Heavenly Man,”(549) the great Total of that\r\nHost of Angels, which was too pure for the creation of the inferior Worlds\r\nor of the Men of our Globe, but which nevertheless _fell_ into Matter by\r\nvirtue of that same evolution, as the Second Logos of the “Father.”(550)\r\n\r\nSynthetically, every Creative Logos, or “the Son who is one with the\r\nFather,” is the Host of the Rectores Mundi in itself. Even Christian\r\nTheology makes of the seven “Angels of the Presence” the Virtues, or the\r\npersonified attributes, of God, which, being created by him, as the Manus\r\nwere by Brahmâ, became Archangels. The Roman Catholic Theodice itself,\r\nrecognizing in its creative Verbum Princeps the Head of these Angels\r\n(_caput angelorum_) and the Angel of the great Counsel (_magni consilii\r\nangelus_), thus recognizes the identity of Christ with them.\r\n\r\n“The Sura became A‐Sura”—the Gods became No‐Gods—says the text; _i.e._,\r\nGods became Fiends—Satan, when read literally. But Satan will now be\r\nshown, in the teaching of the Secret Doctrine, to be allegorized as Good\r\nand Sacrifice, a God of Wisdom, under different names.\r\n\r\nThe _Kabalah_ teaches that Pride and Presumption—the two chief prompters\r\nof Selfishness and Egotism—are the causes that emptied Heaven of _one‐\r\nthird_ of its divine denizens, mystically, and of _one‐third_ of the\r\nstars, astronomically; in other words, the first statement is an allegory,\r\nand the second a fact. The former, nevertheless, is, as shown, intimately\r\nconnected with humanity.\r\n\r\nIn their turn the Rosicrucians, who were well acquainted with the secret\r\nmeaning of the tradition, kept it to themselves, teaching merely that the\r\nwhole of “creation” was due to, and the result of, that legendary “War in\r\nHeaven,” brought on by the rebellion of the Angels(551) against Creative\r\nLaw, or the Demiurge. The statement is correct, but the _inner_ meaning is\r\nto this day a mystery. To elude further explanation of the difficulty, by\r\nappealing to divine mystery, or to the sin of prying into its policy—is to\r\nsay nothing at all. It may prove sufficient for believers in the Pope’s\r\ninfallibility, but will hardly satisfy the philosophical mind. Yet the\r\ntruth, although known to most of the higher Kabalists, has never been told\r\nby any of their number. One and all, Kabalists and Symbologists, have\r\nshown an extraordinary reluctance to confess the primitive meaning of the\r\nFall of the Angels. In a Christian such silence is only natural. Neither\r\nAlchemist nor Philosopher during the Mediæval Ages could have uttered\r\nthat(552) which in the sight of Orthodox Theology was terrible blasphemy,\r\nfor it would have led them directly through the “Holy” Office of the\r\nInquisition, to rack and stake. But for our modern Kabalists and\r\nFreethinkers the case is different. With the latter, we fear, it is merely\r\nhuman pride, vanity based on a loudly rejected but ineradicable\r\nsuperstition. Since the Church, in her struggle with Manicheeïsm, invented\r\nthe Devil, and by placing a theological extinguisher on the radiant Star‐\r\nGod Lucifer, the “Son of the Morning,” thus created the most gigantic of\r\nall her paradoxes, _a black and tenebrous_ Light—the myth has struck its\r\nroots too deeply into the soil of blind faith to permit, in our age, even\r\nthose, who do not acquiesce in her dogmas, and laugh at her horned and\r\ncloven‐footed Satan, to come out bravely and confess the antiquity of the\r\noldest of all traditions. In a few brief words it is this. Semi‐\r\nexoterically, the “First‐born” of the Almighty—Fiat Lux—or the Angels of\r\nPrimordial Light, were commanded to “create”; one‐third of them rebelled\r\nand “refused”; while those who “obeyed” as Fetahil did—_failed_ most\r\nsignally.\r\n\r\nTo realize the refusal and failure in their correct physical meaning, one\r\nmust study and understand Eastern Philosophy; one has to be acquainted\r\nwith the fundamental mystical tenets of the Vedântins, as to the utter\r\nfallacy of attributing functional activity to the Infinite and Absolute\r\nDeity. Esoteric Philosophy maintains that during the Sandhyâs, the\r\n“Central Sun” emits _Creative Light_—passively, so to say. Causality is\r\nlatent. It is only during the active periods of Being that it gives rise\r\nto a stream of ceaseless Energy, whose vibrating currents acquire more\r\nactivity and potency with every rung of the hebdomadic ladder of Being\r\nwhich they descend. Hence it becomes comprehensible how the process of\r\n“creating,” or rather of fashioning, the organic Universe, with all its\r\nunits of the seven kingdoms, necessitated intelligent Beings—who became\r\ncollectively a Being or Creative God, differentiated already from the One\r\nAbsolute Unity, unrelated as the latter is to conditioned “creation.”(553)\r\n\r\nNow the Vatican MS. of the _Kabalah_—the only copy of which (in Europe) is\r\nsaid to have been in the possession of Count St. Germain—contains the most\r\ncomplete exposition of the doctrine, including the peculiar version\r\naccepted by the Luciferians(554) and other Gnostics; and in that parchment\r\nthe “Seven Suns of Life” are given in the order in which they are found in\r\nthe Saptasûrya. Only four of these, however, are mentioned in the editions\r\nof the _Kabalah_ which are procurable in public libraries, and that even\r\nin a more or less veiled phraseology. Nevertheless even this reduced\r\nnumber is amply sufficient to show an identical origin, as it refers to\r\nthe quaternary group of the Dhyân Chohans, and proves the speculation to\r\nhave had its origin in the Secret Doctrines of the Âryans. As is well\r\nknown, the _Kabalah_ did not originate with the Jews, for the latter got\r\ntheir ideas from the Chaldæans and the Egyptians.\r\n\r\nThus even the _exoteric_ Kabalistic teachings speak of a “Central Sun,”\r\nand of three secondary Suns in each Solar System—our own included. As\r\nshown in that able though too materialistic work, _New Aspects of Life and\r\nReligion_, which is a synopsis of the views of the Kabalists in an aspect\r\ndeeply thought out and assimilated:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The central sun ... was to them [as much as to the Âryans] the\r\n    _centre of rest_; the centre to which all motion was to be\r\n    ultimately referred. Round this central sun ... “the first of\r\n    three systemic suns ... revolved on a polar plane ... the second,\r\n    on an equatorial plane” ... and the third only was our visible\r\n    sun. These four solar bodies were “_the organs on whose action\r\n    what man calls the creation, the evolution of life on the planet\r\n    earth, depends_.” The channels through which the influence of\r\n    these bodies was conveyed to the earth they [the Kabalists] held\r\n    to be electrical.... The radiant energy flowing from the central\r\n    sun(555) called the earth into being as a watery globe, ... [whose\r\n    tendency], as the nucleus of a planetary body, was to rush to the\r\n    (central) sun ... within the sphere of whose attraction it had\r\n    been created.... But the radiant energy, similarly electrifying\r\n    both, withheld the one from the other, and so changed motion\r\n    towards into motion round the centre of attraction, which the\r\n    revolving planet [earth] thus sought to reach.\r\n\r\n    In the organic cell the _visible sun_ found its own proper matrix,\r\n    and produced through this the animal [while maturing the\r\n    vegetable] kingdom, finally placing man at its head, in whom,\r\n    through the animating action of that kingdom, it originated the\r\n    psychic cell. But the man so placed at the head of the animal\r\n    kingdom, at the head of the creation, was the animal, the _soul‐\r\n    less, the perishable man_.... Hence man, although apparently its\r\n    crown, would, by his advent have marked the close of creation;\r\n    since creation, culminating in him, would at his death have\r\n    entered on its decline.(556)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Kabalistic view is here quoted, to show its perfect identity in\r\nspirit with the Eastern Doctrine. Explain, or complete the teaching of the\r\nSeven Suns with the seven systems of Planes of Being, of which the “Suns”\r\nare the central bodies, and you have the seven Angelic Planes, whose\r\n“Host” collectively are the Gods thereof.(557) They are the Head Group\r\ndivided into four Classes, from the Incorporeal down to the Semi‐\r\ncorporeal. These Classes are directly connected—though in very different\r\nways as regards voluntary connection and functions—with our mankind. They\r\nare three, synthesized by the fourth, the first and highest, which is\r\ncalled the “Central Sun” in the Kabalistic doctrine just quoted. This is\r\nthe great difference between the Semitic and the Âryan Cosmogony—one\r\nmaterializing, humanizes the mysteries of Nature; the other spiritualizes\r\nMatter, and its physiology is always made subservient to metaphysics.\r\nThus, though the seventh “principle” reaches man through all the phases of\r\nBeing, pure as an indiscrete element and an impersonal unity, it passes\r\nthrough—the _Kabalah_ teaches _from_—the Central Spiritual Sun and Group\r\nthe Second, the Polar Sun, which two radiate on man his Âtmâ. Group Three,\r\nthe Equatorial Sun, cements the Buddhi to Âtman and the higher attributes\r\nof Manas; while Group Four, the Spirit of our visible Sun, endows him with\r\nhis Manas and its vehicle, the Kâma Rûpa, or body of passions and\r\ndesires—the two elements of Ahamkâra which evolve _individualized\r\nconsciousness_, the personal Ego. Finally, it is the Spirit of the Earth,\r\nin its triple unity, that builds the Physical Body, attracting to it the\r\nSpirits of Life and forming his Linga Sharîra.\r\n\r\nBut everything proceeds cyclically, the evolution of man like everything\r\nelse, and the order in which he is generated is described fully in the\r\nEastern Teachings, whereas it is only hinted at in the _Kabalah_. Says the\r\n_Book of Dzyan_ with regard to Primeval Man when first projected by the\r\n“Boneless,” the Incorporeal Creator:\r\n\r\n_First, the Breath, then Buddhi, and the Shadow‐Son [the Body] were\r\n__“__created.__”__ But where was the Pivot [the Middle Principle, Manas]?\r\nMan is doomed. When alone, the Indiscrete [Undifferentiated Element] and\r\nthe Vâhan [Buddhi]—the Cause of the Causeless—break asunder from\r\nmanifested life._\r\n\r\n“_Unless_,” explains the Commentary:\r\n\r\n_Unless cemented and held together by the Middle Principle, the Vehicle of\r\nthe personal consciousness of Jîva._\r\n\r\nIn other words, the two higher “principles” _can have no individuality on\r\nEarth_, cannot be _man_, unless there is (_a_) the Mind, the Manas‐Ego, to\r\ncognize itself, and (_b_) the terrestrial false Personality, or the Body\r\nof egotistical desires and personal Will, to cement the whole, as if round\r\na Pivot—which it is, truly—to the physical form of man. It is the _fifth_\r\nand the _fourth_ “principles”(558)—Manas and Kâma Rûpa—that contain the\r\ndual Personality; the real immortal Ego, if it assimilates itself to the\r\ntwo higher, and the false and transitory Personality, the Mâyâvi or Astral\r\nBody, so‐called, or the Animal‐human Soul—the two having to be closely\r\nblended for purposes of a _full_ terrestrial existence. Incarnate the\r\nSpiritual Monad of a Newton, grafted on that of the greatest saint on\r\nEarth, in a physical body the most perfect you can think of—_i.e._, in a\r\ntwo or even a three‐principled Body composed of its Sthûla Sharîra, Prâna\r\n(Life‐principle) and Linga Sharîra—and, if it lacks its middle and fifth\r\n“principles,” you will have created _an idiot_—at best a beautiful, soul‐\r\nless, empty and unconscious appearance. “_Cogito—ergo sum_” can find no\r\nroom in the brain of such a creature, not on this plane, at any rate.\r\n\r\nThere are students, however, who have long ago understood the\r\nphilosophical meaning underlying the allegory—so tortured and disfigured\r\nby the Roman Church—of the “Fallen Angels.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    The kingdom of spirits and spiritual action, which flows from and\r\n    is the product of spirit volition, is outside and contrasted with\r\n    and in contradiction to the kingdom of [divine] souls and divine\r\n    action.(559)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs said in the text of Commentary xiv:\r\n\r\n_Like produces like and no more at the genesis of Being, and evolution\r\nwith its limited conditioned laws comes later. The Self Existent_(_560_)_\r\nare called __“__Creations,__”__ for they appear in the Spirit‐Ray,\r\nmanifested through the potency inherent in its Unborn Nature, which is\r\nbeyond Time and [limited or conditioned] Space. Terrene products, animate\r\nand inanimate, including mankind, are falsely called creation and\r\ncreatures; they are the development [evolution] of the Discrete Elements._\r\n\r\nAgain:\r\n\r\n_The Heavenly Rûpa [Dhyân Chohan] creates [man] in his own form; it is a\r\nspiritual ideation consequent on the first differentiation and awakening\r\nof the universal [manifested] Substance; that form is the ideal Shadow of\r\nItself: and this is the Man of the First Race._\r\n\r\nTo express it in still clearer form, limiting the explanation to this\r\nEarth only, it was the duty of the first “differentiated” Egos—the Church\r\ncalls them Archangels—to imbue Primordial Matter with the evolutionary\r\nimpulse and guide its formative powers in the fashioning of its\r\nproductions. This it is which is referred to in the sentences both in the\r\nEastern and Western tradition—“the Angels were _commanded to create_.”\r\nAfter the Earth had been made ready by the _lower_ and more material\r\nPowers, and its three Kingdoms fairly started on their way to be “fruitful\r\nand multiply,” the higher Powers, the Archangels or Dhyânîs, were\r\ncompelled by the Evolutionary Law to descend on Earth, in order to\r\nconstruct the crown of its evolution—Man. Thus the “Self‐created” and the\r\n“Self‐existent” projected their pale Shadows; but Group the Third, the\r\nFire‐Angels, _rebelled and refused_ to join their fellow Devas.\r\n\r\nHindû exotericism represents them all as Yogins, whose piety inspired them\r\nto refuse to “create,” as they desired to remain eternally Kumâras,\r\n“Virgin Youths,” in order, if possible, to anticipate their fellows in\r\nprogress towards Nirvâna‐the final liberation. But, agreeably to Esoteric\r\ninterpretation, it was a self‐sacrifice for the benefit of mankind. The\r\n“Rebels” would not create will‐less irresponsible men, as the “obedient”\r\nAngels did; nor could they endow human beings with even the temporary\r\nreflections of their own attributes; for the latter, belonging to another\r\nand a so much higher plane of consciousness, would leave man still\r\nirresponsible, hence interfere with any possibility of higher progress. No\r\nspiritual and psychic evolution is possible on Earth—the lowest and most\r\nmaterial plane—for one who, on that plane at all events, is inherently\r\n_perfect_ and cannot accumulate either merit or demerit. Had Man remained\r\nthe pale Shadow of the inert, immutable, and motionless Perfection, the\r\none negative and passive attribute of the real _I am that I am_, he would\r\nhave been doomed to pass through life on Earth as in a heavy dreamless\r\nsleep; hence a failure on this plane. The Beings, or the Being,\r\ncollectively called Elohim, who first pronounced (if, indeed, they ever\r\nwere pronounced) the cruel words, “Behold, the man is become _as one of\r\nus_, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take\r\nalso of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever ...”—must have been\r\nindeed the Ilda‐baoth, the Demiurge of the Nazarenes, filled with rage and\r\nenvy against his own creature, the reflection of which created\r\nOphiomorphos. In this case it is but natural—even from the dead‐letter\r\nstandpoint—to view Satan, the Serpent of _Genesis_, as the real creator\r\nand benefactor, the Father of Spiritual Mankind. For it is he who was the\r\n“Harbinger of Light,” bright radiant Lucifer, who opened the eyes of the\r\nautomaton “created” by Jehovah, as alleged. And he who was the first to\r\nwhisper, “in the day ye eat thereof ye shall be as Elohim, knowing good\r\nand evil,” can only be regarded in the light of a Saviour. An “Adversary”\r\nto Jehovah, the “_personating_ spirit,” he still remains in Esoteric Truth\r\nthe ever‐loving “Messenger,” the Angel, the Seraphim and Cherubim who both\r\n“knew” well, and “loved” still more, and who conferred on us Spiritual,\r\ninstead of Physical Immortality—the latter a kind of _static_ immortality\r\nthat would have transformed man into an undying “Wandering Jew.”\r\n\r\nAs narrated in King’s _Gnostics and their Remains_ concerning Ildabaoth,\r\nwhom several sects regarded as the God of Moses:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ildabaoth was far from being a pure spirit; ambition and pride\r\n    dominated in his composition. He therefore resolved to break off\r\n    all connection with his mother, Achamoth, and to create a world\r\n    entirely for himself. Aided by his own Six Spirits, he created\r\n    Man, intending him for the image of his power; but he failed\r\n    utterly in his work, his Man proving a vast, soulless monster,\r\n    crawling upon the earth. The Six Spirits were obliged to bring\r\n    their work again before their father, to be animated: he did so by\r\n    communicating the ray of Divine Light which he himself had\r\n    inherited from Achamoth, who by this loss punished him for his\r\n    pride and self‐sufficiency.\r\n\r\n    Man, thus favoured by Achamoth at the expense of her own son,\r\n    followed the impulse of the Divine Light that she had transferred\r\n    to him, collected a further supply out of the creation with which\r\n    it was intermingled, and began to present not the image of his\r\n    creator Ildabaoth, but rather that of the Supreme Being, the\r\n    “Primal Man.” At this spectacle the Demiurgus was filled with rage\r\n    and envy at having produced a being so superior to himself. His\r\n    looks, inspired by his passions, were reflected in the Abyss, as\r\n    in a mirror, the image became instinct with life, and forth arose\r\n    “Satan Serpent‐formed,” _Ophiomorphos_, the embodiment of envy and\r\n    cunning.(561)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the exoteric rendering of the Gnostics, and the allegory, though a\r\nsectarian version, is suggestive, and seems true to life. It is the\r\nnatural deduction from the dead‐letter text of Chapter iii of _Genesis_.\r\nHence the allegory of Prometheus, who steals the Divine Fire so as to\r\nallow men to proceed consciously on the path of Spiritual Evolution, thus\r\ntransforming the most perfect of _animals_ on Earth into a potential God,\r\nand making him free to “take the kingdom of heaven by violence.” Hence,\r\nalso, the _curse_ pronounced by Zeus against Prometheus, and by Jehovah‐\r\nIlda‐baoth against his “rebellious son,” Satan. The cold, pure snows of\r\nthe Caucasian mountain and the never‐dying, singeing fire and flames of an\r\ninextinguishable Hell, two poles, yet the same idea, the dual aspect of a\r\nrefined torture; a “Fire‐producer”—the personified emblem of Φωσφόρος\r\n(_Phósphoros_), of the Astral Fire and Light in the Anima Mundi (that\r\nElement of which the German materialist philosopher Moleschott said: “ohne\r\n_Phosphor_ kein Gedanke,” or “without phosphorus no thought”)—burning in\r\nthe fierce Flames of his terrestrial Passions; the conflagration fired by\r\nhis Thought, discerning as it now does good from evil, and yet a slave to\r\nthe passions of its earthly Adam; feeling the vulture of doubt and full\r\nconsciousness gnawing at its heart—a Prometheus indeed, because a\r\n_conscious_, and hence a _responsible_ entity.(562) The curse of life is\r\ngreat, yet, with the exception of some Hindû and Sufi mystics, how few are\r\nthose who would exchange all the tortures of conscious life, all the evils\r\nof a responsible existence, for the unconscious perfection of a passive\r\n(objectively) _incorporeal_ Being, or even the universal static Inertia\r\npersonified in Brahmâ during his “Night’s” Rest. For, to quote from an\r\nable article by one(563) who, confusing the planes of existence and\r\nconsciousness, fell a victim thereto:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Satan [or Lucifer] represents the _Active_, or, as [M. Jules]\r\n    Baissac calls it, the “Centrifugal” Energy of the Universe [in a\r\n    cosmic sense]. He is Fire, Light, Life, Struggle, Effort, Thought,\r\n    Consciousness, Progress, Civilization, Liberty, Independence. At\r\n    the same time he is _Pain_, which is the Reaction of the\r\n    _Pleasure_ of Action, and _Death_—which is the Revolution of\r\n    _Life_—Satan, burning in his own Hell, produced by the fury of his\r\n    own momentum—the expansive disintegration of the Nebula which is\r\n    to concentrate into New Worlds. And fitly is he again and again\r\n    baffled by the Eternal Inertia of the _Passive_ Energy of the\r\n    Kosmos—the inexorable “_I am_”—the Flint from which the sparks are\r\n    beaten out. And fitly ... are he and his adherents ... consigned\r\n    to the “Sea of Fire”—because _it is_ the Sun [in one sense only in\r\n    the cosmic allegory], the Fount of Life in _our_ system, where\r\n    they are purified (meaning thereby disintegrated) and churned up\r\n    to reärrange them for another life (the Resurrection)—that _Sun_\r\n    which, as the Origin of the Active Principle of our Earth, is at\r\n    once the _Home_ and the _Source_ of the Mundane Satan....\r\n\r\n    Furthermore, as if to demonstrate the accuracy of Baissac’s\r\n    general theory [in _Le Diable et Satan_] cold is known to have a\r\n    “Centripetal” effect. Under the influence of Cold everything\r\n    contracts.... Under it Life _hybernates_, or dies out, Thought\r\n    congeals, and Fire is extinguished. Satan is immortal in his own\r\n    Fire‐Sea—it is only in the “Nifl‐Heim” [the cold Hell of the\r\n    Scandinavian _Eddas_] of the “_I am_” that he cannot exist. But\r\n    for all that there is a kind of _Immortal_ Existence in Nifl‐Heim,\r\n    and that Existence must be _Painless_ and _Peaceful_, because it\r\n    is _Unconscious_ and _Inactive_. In the Kingdom of _Jehovah_ [if\r\n    this God were all that the Jews and Christians claim for him]\r\n    there is no misery, no war, no marrying and giving in marriage, no\r\n    change, no _Individual Consciousness_.(564) All is absorbed in the\r\n    spirit of the Most Powerful. _It is emphatically a Kingdom of\r\n    Peace and loyal Submission, as that of the __“__Arch‐Rebel__”__ is\r\n    one of War and Revolution...._ It [the former] is in fact what\r\n    Theosophy calls Nirvâna. But then Theosophy teaches that\r\n    Separation from the Primal Source _having once occurred_, Reünion\r\n    can only be achieved by _Will‐Effort_—which is distinctly Satanic\r\n    in the sense of this essay.(565)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt _is_ “Satanic” from the standpoint of orthodox Romanism, for it is\r\nowing to the prototype of that which became in time the Christian Devil—to\r\nthe Radiant Archangels, Dhyân Chohans, who refused to create, because they\r\nwanted Man _to become his own creator_ and an immortal God—that men can\r\nreach Nirvâna and the Haven of heavenly Divine Peace.\r\n\r\nTo close this rather lengthy comment, the Secret Doctrine teaches that the\r\nFire‐Devas, the Rudras, and the Kumâras, the “Virgin‐Angels,” (to whom the\r\nArchangels, Michael and Gabriel, both belong,) the Divine “Rebels”—called\r\nby the all‐materializing and positive Jews, the Nahash or\r\n“Deprived”—preferred the _curse_ of _incarnation_ and the long cycles of\r\nterrestrial existence and rebirths, to seeing the misery, even if\r\n_unconscious_, of the beings who were evolved as Shadows out of their\r\nBrethren, through the semi‐passive energy of their _too spiritual_\r\nCreators. If “man’s uses of life should be such as neither to animalize\r\nnor to spiritualize, but to _humanize_ Self,”(566) to do so, he must be\r\nborn _human_ not angelic. Hence, tradition shows the celestial Yogîs\r\noffering themselves as voluntary victims in order to redeem Humanity,\r\nwhich was created god‐like and perfect at first, and endow him with human\r\naffections and aspirations. To do this they had to give up their natural\r\nstatus, descend on our Globe, and take up their abode on it for the whole\r\ncycle of the Mahâyuga, thus exchanging their impersonal Individualities\r\nfor individual Personalities—the bliss of sidereal existence for the curse\r\nof terrestrial life. This voluntary sacrifice of the Fiery Angels, whose\r\nnature was _Knowledge_ and _Love_, has been construed by the exoteric\r\ntheologies into a statement that shows “the Rebel Angels hurled down from\r\nHeaven into the darkness of Hell”—our Earth. Hindû Philosophy hints at the\r\ntruth by teaching that the Asuras, hurled down by Shiva, are only in an\r\n_intermediate state_, in which they prepare for higher degrees of\r\npurification and redemption from their wretched condition; but Christian\r\nTheology—claiming to be based on the rock of the divine love, charity, and\r\njustice of him it appeals to as its Saviour—to paradoxically enforce that\r\nclaim, has invented the dreary dogma of Hell, that Archimedean lever of\r\nRoman Catholic philosophy.\r\n\r\nWhereas Rabbinical wisdom—than which there is none more positive,\r\nmaterialistic, or grossly terrestrial, as it brings everything down to\r\nphysiological mysteries—calls these Beings, the “Evil One”; and the\r\nKabalists—Nahash, “Deprived,” as just said, and the Souls that have,\r\n_after having been alienated in Heaven from the Holy One_, thrown\r\nthemselves into an Abyss at the dawn of their very existence, and have\r\nanticipated the time when they are to descend on Earth.(567)\r\n\r\nAnd let me explain at once that our quarrel is not with the _Zohar_ or any\r\nother book of the _Kabalah_ in its right interpretation—for the latter is\r\nthe same as our own—but only with the gross, _pseudo_‐esoteric\r\nexplanations of the later, and especially of the Christian Kabalists.\r\n\r\nSays the Commentary:\r\n\r\n_Our earth and man [are] the products of the three Fires._\r\n\r\nThe names of these three answer, in Sanskrit, to the “Electric Fire,” the\r\n“Solar Fire,” and the “Fire produced by Friction.” Explained on the cosmic\r\nand human planes, these three Fires are Spirit, Soul, and Body, the three\r\ngreat Root Groups, with their four additional divisions. These vary with\r\nthe Schools, and—according to their applications—become the Upâdhis and\r\nthe Vehicles, or the Noumena of these. In the exoteric accounts, they are\r\npersonified by the “three sons of surpassing brilliancy and splendour” of\r\nAgni Abhimânin, the eldest son of Brahmâ, the Cosmic Logos, by Svâhâ, one\r\nof Daksha’s(568) daughters. In the metaphysical sense, the “Fire by\r\nFriction” means the union between Buddhi, the sixth, and Manas, the fifth\r\n“principle,” which thus are united or cemented together, the fifth merging\r\npartially into and becoming part of the Monad; in the physical, it relates\r\nto the “creative spark,” or germ, which fructifies and generates the human\r\nbeing. The three Fires, whose names are Pâvaka, Pavamâna and Shuchi, were\r\ncondemned, it is said, by a curse of Vasishtha, the great Sage, “to be\r\nborn over and over again.”(569) This is clear enough.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the Flames, whose functions are confused in the exoteric books,\r\nand who are called indifferently Prajâpatis, Pitris, Manus, Asuras,\r\nRishis, Kumâras,(570) etc., are said to incarnate personally in the Third\r\nRoot‐Race and thus find themselves “reborn over and over again.” In the\r\nEsoteric Doctrine they are generally named Asuras, or the Asura Devatâ or\r\nPitar Devatâ (Gods), for, as said, they were first Gods—and the\r\nhighest—before they became “_No_‐Gods,” and had from Spirits of Heaven\r\nfallen into Spirits of Earth(571)—_exoterically_, note well, in orthodox\r\ndogma.\r\n\r\nNo Theologian or Orientalist can ever understand the genealogies of the\r\nPrajâpatis, the Manus, and the Rishis, or the direct connection of\r\nthese—their correlation rather—with the Gods, unless he has the key to the\r\nold primitive Cosmogony and Theogony, which all nations originally had in\r\ncommon. All these Gods and Demi‐gods are found reborn on Earth, in various\r\nKalpas and in as various characters; each, moreover, _having his Karma\r\ndistinctly traced, and every effect assigned to its cause_.\r\n\r\nBefore other Stanzas could be explained, it was, as may be seen,\r\nabsolutely necessary to show that the Sons of “Dark Wisdom,” though\r\nidentical with the Archangels which Theology has chosen to call the\r\n“Fallen,” are as divine and as pure, if not more pure, than all the\r\nMichaels and Gabriels so glorified in the Churches. The “Old Book” also\r\ngoes into various details of Astral Life, which at this juncture would be\r\nquite incomprehensible to the reader. It must, therefore, be left for\r\nlater explanation, and the First and Second Races will now receive only\r\nbare notice. Not so the Third Race—the Root‐Race which separated into\r\nsexes, and which was the first to be endowed with reason; men evolving\r\n_pari passu_ with the Globe, and the latter having “incrustated” more than\r\na hundred millions of years before the first human sub‐race had yet begun\r\nto materialize or solidify, so to say. But, as the Stanza has it:\r\n\r\n_The Inner Man [the Conscious Entity] was not._\r\n\r\nThis “Conscious Entity” Occultism says, comes from, nay, in many cases\r\n_is_, the very essence and _esse_ of the high Intelligences, condemned, by\r\nthe undeviating law of Karmic evolution, to reïncarnate in this\r\nManvantara.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Shloka 39 relates exclusively to the racial divisions. Strictly\r\nspeaking, Esoteric Philosophy teaches a modified polygenesis. For, while\r\nit assigns to humanity a oneness of origin, in so far that its Forefathers\r\nor “Creators” were all Divine Beings—though of different classes or\r\ndegrees of perfection in their Hierarchy—it teaches that men were\r\nnevertheless born at seven different centres of the Continent of that\r\nperiod. Though all were of one common origin, yet, for reasons given,\r\ntheir potentialities and mental capabilities, outward or physical forms,\r\nand future characteristics, were very different.(572) As to their\r\ncomplexions, there is a suggestive allegory told in _Linga Purâna_. The\r\nKumâras—the Rudra Gods, so called—are described as incarnations of Shiva,\r\nthe Destroyer (of _outward forms_), called also Vâmadeva. The latter, as a\r\nKumâra, the “Eternal Celibate,” the chaste Virgin Youth, springs from\r\nBrahmâ in each great Manvantara, and “again becomes four”; a reference to\r\nthe four great divisions of the human Races, as regards complexion and\r\ntype—and the three chief variations of these. Thus in the twenty‐ninth\r\nKalpa—in this case a reference to the transformation and evolution of the\r\nhuman form, which Shiva ever destroys and remodels periodically down to\r\nthe great Manvantaric turning point, about the middle of the Fourth\r\n(Atlantean) Race—in the twenty‐ninth Kalpa, Shiva, as Shvetalohita, the\r\nRoot‐Kumâra, from moon‐coloured becomes _white_; in his next\r\ntransformation, he is _red_ (and in this the exoteric version differs from\r\nthe Esoteric Teaching); in the third, _yellow_; in the fourth, _black_.\r\n\r\nEsotericism now classes these seven variations, with their four great\r\ndivisions, into only three distinct primeval Races—as it does not take\r\ninto consideration the First Race, which had neither type nor colour, and\r\na hardly objective, though colossal, form. The evolution of these Races,\r\ntheir formation and development, proceeded on parallel lines with the\r\nevolution, formation, and development of three geological strata, from\r\nwhich the human complexion was as much derived as it was determined by the\r\nclimates of these zones. The Esoteric Teaching names three great\r\ndivisions, namely, the _red‐yellow_, the _black_, and the _brown‐\r\nwhite_.(573) The Âryan races, for instance, now varying from dark brown,\r\nalmost black, red‐brown‐yellow, down to the whitest creamy colour, are\r\nnevertheless all of one and the same stock, the Fifth Root‐Race, and\r\nspring from one single Progenitor, called in Hindû _exotericism_ by the\r\ngeneric name of Vaivasvata Manu; the latter, remember, being that Generic\r\nPersonage, the Sage, who is said to have lived over 18,000,000 years ago,\r\nand also 850,000 years ago—at the time of the sinking of the last remnants\r\nof the Great Continent of Atlantis,(574) and who is said to live even now\r\nin his mankind.(575) The light yellow is the colour of the first _solid_\r\nhuman race, which appeared after the middle of the Third Root‐Race—after\r\nits fall into generation, as just explained—bringing on the final changes.\r\nFor, it is only at that period that the last transformation took place,\r\nwhich brought forth man as he is now, only on a magnified scale. This Race\r\ngave birth to the Fourth Race; “Shiva” gradually transforming that portion\r\nof Humanity which became “black with sin” into red‐yellow, of which the\r\nred Indians and the Mongolians are the descendants, and finally into\r\nbrown‐white races—which now, together with the yellow races, form the\r\ngreat bulk of Humanity. The allegory in _Linga Purâna_ is curious, as\r\nshowing the great ethnological knowledge of the ancients.\r\n\r\nWhen reading of the “last transformation,” which is said to have taken\r\nplace 18,000,000 years ago, let the reader at this juncture, consider how\r\nmany millions more it must have required to reach that final stage. And if\r\nMan, in his gradual consolidation, developed _pari passu_ with the Earth,\r\nhow many millions of years must have elapsed during the First, Second, and\r\nthe first half of the Third Race. For the Earth was in a comparatively\r\nethereal condition before it reached its last consolidated state. The\r\nArchaic Teachings, moreover, tell us that, during the middle period of the\r\nLemuro‐Atlantean Race, three and a half Races after the Genesis of Man,\r\nthe Earth, Man, and everything on the Globe, were of a still grosser and\r\nmore material nature, while such things as corals and some shells were\r\nstill in a semi‐gelatinous, astral state. The cycles that have intervened\r\nsince then, have already carried us onward, on the opposite ascending arc,\r\nsome steps toward our “dematerialization,” as the Spiritualists would say.\r\nThe Earth, ourselves, and all things have softened since then—aye, even\r\nour brains. But it has been objected by some Theosophists that an ethereal\r\nEarth even some 15 or 20,000,000 years ago, “does not square with\r\nGeology,” which teaches us that winds blew, rains fell, waves broke on the\r\nshore, sands shifted and accumulated, etc.; that, in short, all natural\r\ncauses now in operation were then in force, “in the very earliest ages of\r\ngeological time, aye, that of the oldest palæozoic rocks.” To this the\r\nfollowing answers are given. Firstly, what is the date assigned by Geology\r\nto these “oldest palæozoic rocks”? And secondly, why could not the winds\r\nblow, rain fall, and waves—of “carbonic acid” apparently, as Science seems\r\nto imply—break on the shore, on an Earth semi‐astral, _i.e._, viscid? The\r\nword “astral” does not necessarily, in Occult phraseology, mean as thin as\r\nsmoke, but rather “starry,” shining or pellucid, in various and numerous\r\ndegrees, from a quite filmy to a viscid state, as just observed. But it is\r\nfurther objected: “How could an astral Earth have affected the other\r\nPlanets in this System? Would not the whole process get out of gear now if\r\nthe attraction of one Planet were suddenly removed?” The objection is\r\nevidently invalid, since our System is composed of older and younger\r\nPlanets, some dead—like the Moon—others in process of formation, for all\r\nthat Astronomy knows to the contrary. Nor has the latter ever affirmed, so\r\nfar as we know, that all the bodies of our System have sprung into\r\nexistence and developed simultaneously. The Cis‐Himâlayan Secret Teachings\r\ndiffer from those of India in this respect. Hindû Occultism teaches that\r\nthe Vaivasvata Manu Humanity is 18,000,000 and odd years old. We say, yes;\r\nbut only so far as _physical_ or approximately physical, Man is concerned,\r\nwho dates from the close of the Third Root‐Race. Beyond that period _Man_,\r\nor his filmy image, may have existed for 300,000,000 years, for all we\r\nknow; _since we are not taught figures_ which are and will remain secret\r\nwith the Masters of Occult Science, as justly stated in _Esoteric\r\nBuddhism_. Moreover, whereas the Hindû _Purânas_ speak of one Vaivasvata\r\nManu, we affirm that there were several, the name being a generic one.\r\n\r\nWe must now say a few more words on the physical evolution of man.\r\n\r\n\r\nArchaic Teachings In The “Purânas” And “Genesis.” Physical Evolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe writer cannot give too much proof that the system of Cosmogony and\r\nAnthropogony above described actually existed, that its records _are_\r\npreserved, and that it is found mirrored even in the modern versions of\r\nancient Scriptures.\r\n\r\nThe _Purânas_ on the one hand, and the Jewish Scriptures on the other, are\r\nbased on the same scheme of evolution, which, if read Esoterically and\r\nexpressed in modern language, would be found to be quite as scientific as\r\nmuch of what now passes current as the final word of recent discovery. The\r\nonly difference between the two schemes is, that the _Purânas_, giving as\r\nmuch, and perhaps more, attention to causes than to effects, allude to the\r\npre‐cosmic and pre‐genetic periods rather than to those of so‐called\r\n“creation,” whereas the _Bible_, after saying only a few words on the\r\nformer period, plunges forthwith into material genesis, and, while almost\r\nskipping the Pre‐Adamic races, proceeds with its allegories concerning the\r\nFifth Race.\r\n\r\nNow, whatever the onslaught made on the “order of creation” in\r\n_Genesis_—and its dead‐letter account certainly lends itself admirably to\r\ncriticism(576)—the Hindû _Purânas_, notwithstanding their allegorical\r\nexaggerations will be found quite in accordance with Physical Science.\r\n\r\nEven what, on the face of it, appears to be the perfectly nonsensical\r\nallegory of Brahmâ assuming the form of a Boar to rescue the Earth from\r\nunder the waters, finds a perfectly scientific explanation in the Secret\r\nCommentaries, relating as it does to the many risings and sinkings, the\r\nconstant alternation of water and land from the earliest to the latest\r\ngeological periods of our Globe; for Science teaches us now that nine‐\r\ntenths of the stratified formations of the Earth’s crust have been\r\ngradually constructed beneath the water at the bottom of the seas. The\r\nancient Âryans are credited with having known nothing whatever of Natural\r\nHistory, Geology, and so on. The Jewish race is, on the other hand,\r\nproclaimed even by its severest critic, an uncompromising opponent of the\r\n_Bible_, to have the merit of having conceived the idea of monotheism\r\n“earlier, and retained it more firmly, than any of the _less philosophical\r\nand more immoral religions_ (!!) of the ancient world.”(577) Only, while\r\nin biblical Esotericism, we find physiological sexual mysteries\r\nsymbolized, and very little more, something for which _very little real\r\nPhilosophy_ is requisite—in the _Purânas_ one can find the most scientific\r\nand philosophical “dawn of creation,” which, if impartially analyzed and\r\nrendered into plain language from its fairy‐tale‐like allegories, would\r\nshow that modern Zoology, Geology, Astronomy, and nearly all the branches\r\nof modern knowledge, have been anticipated in ancient Science, and were\r\nknown to ancient Philosophers in their general features, if not in such\r\ndetail as at present.\r\n\r\nPaurânic Astronomy, with all its deliberate concealment and confusion for\r\nthe purpose of leading the profane off the real track, has been shown even\r\nby Bentley to be a real science; and those who are versed in the mysteries\r\nof Hindû astronomical treatises, will prove that the modern theories of\r\nthe progressive condensation of nebulæ, nebulous stars and suns, with the\r\nmost minute details about the cyclic progress of asterisms for\r\nchronological and other purposes—far more correct than Europeans have even\r\nnow—were known in India to perfection.\r\n\r\nIf we turn to Geology and Zoology we find the same. What are all the myths\r\nand endless genealogies of the seven Prajâpatis, of their sons, the seven\r\nRishis or Manus, and of their wives, sons and progeny, but a vast detailed\r\naccount of the progressive development and evolution of animal creation,\r\none species after the other? Were the highly philosophical and\r\nmetaphysical Âryans—the authors of the most perfect philosophical system\r\nof transcendental Psychology, of codes of Ethics, of such a grammar as\r\nPânini’s, of the Sânkhya and Vedânta systems, of a moral code (Buddhism),\r\nproclaimed by Max Müller the most perfect on earth—were the Âryans such\r\nfools, or children, as to lose their time in writing “fairy tales,” such\r\nas the _Purânas_ now seem to be in the eyes of those who have not the\r\nremotest idea of their secret meaning? What is the “fable,” the genealogy\r\nand origin of Kashyapa, with his twelve wives by whom he had a numerous\r\nand diversified progeny of serpents (Nâgas), reptiles, birds, and all\r\nkinds of living things, who was thus the “father” of all kinds of animals,\r\nbut a _veiled_ record of the order of evolution in _this_ Round? So far,\r\nwe do not see that any Orientalist has ever had the remotest conception of\r\nthe truths concealed under the allegories and personifications. The\r\n_Shatapatha Brâhmana_, says one, gives “_a not very intelligible_ account”\r\nof Kashyapa’s origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n    According to the _Mahâbhârata_, the _Râmâyana_, and the _Purânas_,\r\n    he was the son of Marîchi, the son of Brahmâ, the father of\r\n    Vivasvat, the father of Manu, the progenitor of mankind.\r\n\r\n    According to the _Shatapatha Brahmâna_: Having assumed the form of\r\n    a tortoise, Prajâpati created offspring. That which he created he\r\n    made (_akarot_); hence the word _kûrma_ (tortoise). Kashyapa means\r\n    tortoise; hence men say, “All creatures are descendants of\r\n    Kashyapa.”(578)\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was all this; he was also the father of the bird Garuda, the “king of\r\nthe feathered tribe,” who _descends from_, and is of one stock with _the\r\nreptiles_, the Nâgas, and who becomes their mortal enemy _subsequently_—as\r\nhe is also a _cycle_, a period of time, when, in the course of evolution,\r\nthe birds which developed from reptiles in their “struggle for life” and\r\n“survival of the fittest,” etc., turned in preference on those from whom\r\nthey issued to devour them, perhaps prompted by natural law, in order to\r\nmake room for other and more perfect species.\r\n\r\nIn that admirable epitome, _Modern Science and Modern Thought_, a lesson\r\nin Natural History is offered to Mr. Gladstone, showing the utter variance\r\nof the _Bible_ with it. The author remarks that Geology traces the “dawn\r\nof creation” through a line of scientific research:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Commencing with the earliest known fossil, the Eozoon Canadense of\r\n    the Laurentian, and continued in a chain, every link of which is\r\n    firmly welded, through the Silurian, with its abundance of\r\n    molluscous, crustacean, and vermiform life, and first indication\r\n    of fishes; the Devonian, with its predominance of fish and first\r\n    appearance of reptiles; the Mesozoic with its batrachians; the\r\n    Secondary formations, in which reptiles of the sea, land and air\r\n    preponderated, and the first humble forms of vertebrate land\r\n    animals began to appear; and finally the Tertiary, in which\r\n    mammalian life has become abundant, and type succeeding to type\r\n    and species to species, are gradually differentiated and\r\n    specialized, through the Eocene, Miocene, and Pliocene periods,\r\n    until we arrive at the Glacial and Prehistoric periods, and at\r\n    positive proof of the existence of man.(579)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same order, _plus_ the description of animals unknown to Modern\r\nScience, is found in the Commentaries on the _Purânas_ in general, and in\r\nthe _Book of Dzyan_ especially. The only difference—a grave one, no doubt,\r\nas implying a spiritual and divine nature of man independent of his\r\nphysical body in this illusionary world, in which the _false personality_\r\nand its cerebral basis alone is known to orthodox Psychology—is as\r\nfollows. Having been in all the so‐called seven “creations,” which stand\r\nallegorically for the seven evolutionary changes, or sub‐races, as we may\r\ncall them, of the First Root‐Race of Mankind—Man has been on Earth in this\r\nRound from the beginning. Having passed through all the Kingdoms of Nature\r\nin the previous _three_ Rounds,(580) his _physical_ frame—one adapted to\r\nthe thermal conditions of those early periods—was ready to receive the\r\nDivine Pilgrim at the first dawn of human life, _i.e._, 18,000,000 years\r\nago. It is only at the mid‐point of the Third Root‐Race that man was\r\nendowed with Manas. Once united, the Two and then the Three made One; for\r\nthough the lower animals, from the amœba to man, received _their_ Monads,\r\nin which all the higher qualities are potential, these qualities have to\r\nremain dormant till the animal reaches its human form, before which stage\r\nManas (mind) has no development in them. In the animals every principle is\r\nparalyzed, and in a fœtus‐like state, save the second, the Vital, and the\r\nthird, the Astral, and the rudiments of the fourth, Kâma, which is desire,\r\ninstinct—whose intensity and development varies and changes with the\r\nspecies. To the materialist wedded to the Darwinian theory, this will read\r\nlike a fairy‐tale, a mystification; to the believer in the inner,\r\nspiritual man, the statement will have nothing unnatural in it.\r\n\r\nAs Commentary ix says:\r\n\r\n_Men are made complete only during their Third, toward the Fourth Cycle\r\n[Race]. They are made __“__Gods__”__ for good and evil, and responsible,\r\nonly when the two arcs meet [after three and a half Rounds towards the\r\nFifth Race]. They are made so by the Nirmânakâya [Spiritual or Astral\r\nremains] of the Rudra‐Kumâras, __“__cursed to be reborn on Earth\r\nagain__”__ [meaning—doomed in their natural turn to reïncarnation in the\r\nhigher ascending arc of the terrestrial Cycle]._\r\n\r\nNow the writer is certain to be met with what will be termed insuperable\r\nobjections. We shall be told that the line of embryology, the gradual\r\ndevelopment of every individual life, and the progress of what is known to\r\ntake place in the order of progressive stages of specialization—that all\r\nthis is opposed to the idea of man preceding mammals. Man begins as the\r\nhumblest and most primitive vermiform creature:\r\n\r\n\r\n    From the primitive speck of protoplasm, and the nucleated cell in\r\n    which all life originates ... and “is developed through stages\r\n    undistinguishable from those of fish, reptile and mammal, until\r\n    the cell finally attains the highly specialized development of the\r\n    quadrumanous, and, last of all, of the human type.”(581)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is perfectly scientific, and we have nothing against _that_; for it\r\nall relates to the _shell_ of man—his body, which, in its growth, is\r\nsubject, of course, like every other once so‐called morphological unit, to\r\nsuch metamorphoses. It is not those who teach the transformation of the\r\nmineral atom through crystallization—which is the same function, and bears\r\nthe same relation to its so‐called _inorganic_ Upâdhi, or basis, as the\r\nformation of _cells_ to their organic nuclei, through plant, insect and\r\nanimal into man—it is not they who will reject this theory, as it will\r\nfinally lead to the recognition of a Universal Deity in Nature, ever‐\r\npresent, and as ever invisible and unknowable, and of intra‐cosmic Gods,\r\nwho were all once men.(582)\r\n\r\nBut we would ask, what does Science and its exact discoveries and now\r\naxiomatic theories prove against _our_ Occult theory? Those who believe in\r\nthe law of evolution and gradual progressive development from a cell—which\r\nfrom a vital became a morphological cell, until it finally awoke as\r\nprotoplasm pure and simple—can surely never limit their belief to one line\r\nof evolution! The types of life are innumerable; and the progress of\r\nevolution, moreover, does not go at the same rate in every kind of\r\nspecies. The constitution of primordial matter in the Silurian age—we mean\r\nthe “primordial” _matter_ of Science—was the same in every essential\r\nparticular, save its degree of present grossness, as the primordial\r\n_living_ matter of to‐day. Nor do we find that which ought to be found, if\r\nthe now orthodox theory of evolution were _quite_ correct, namely, a\r\nconstant, ever‐flowing progress in every species of being. Instead of\r\nthis, what does one see? While the intermediate groups of animal beings\r\nall tend toward a higher type, and while specializations, now of one type\r\nand now of another, develop through the geological ages, change forms,\r\nassume new shapes, appear and disappear with a kaleidoscopic rapidity, in\r\nthe description of Palæontologists from one period to another, the two\r\nsolitary exceptions to the general rule are those at the two opposite\r\npoles of life and type, namely—_man_ and the _lower genera_ of being!\r\n\r\n\r\n    Certain well‐marked forms of living beings have existed through\r\n    enormous epochs, surviving not only the changes of physical\r\n    conditions, _but persisting comparatively unaltered_, while other\r\n    forms of life have appeared and disappeared. Such forms may be\r\n    termed “persistent types” of life; and examples of them are\r\n    abundant enough in both the animal and the vegetable worlds.(583)\r\n\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we are not given any good reason why Darwin links together\r\nreptiles, birds, amphibians, fishes, mollusca, etc., as off‐shoots of a\r\nmoneric ancestry. Nor are we told whether reptiles, for instance, are\r\ndirect descendants of the amphibia, the latter of fishes, and fishes of\r\nlower forms—which they certainly are. For the Monads have passed through\r\nall these forms of being up to Man, on every Globe, in the _three\r\npreceding_ Rounds; every Round, as well as every subsequent Globe, from A\r\nto G, having been, and still having to be, the arena of the same\r\nevolution, only repeated each time on a more solid material basis.\r\nTherefore the question, “What relation is there between the Third Round\r\nastral prototypes and ordinary physical development in the course of the\r\norigination of pre‐mammalian organic species?”—is easily answered. One is\r\nthe shadowy prototype of the other, the preliminary, hardly defined, and\r\nevanescent sketch on the canvas, of objects which are destined to receive\r\ntheir final and vivid form under the brush of the painter. The fish\r\nevolved into an amphibian—a frog—in the _shadows_ of ponds, and man passed\r\nthrough all his metamorphoses on this Globe in the Third Round as he did\r\nin this, his Fourth Cycle. The Third Round types contributed to the\r\nformation of the types in the present Round. On strict analogy, the cycle\r\nof seven Rounds in their work of the gradual formation of man through\r\nevery Kingdom of Nature, is repeated on a microscopical scale in the first\r\nseven months of gestation of a future human being. Let the student think\r\nover and work out this analogy. As the seven months’ old unborn baby,\r\nthough quite ready, yet needs two months more in which to acquire strength\r\nand consolidate; so man, having perfected his evolution during seven\r\nRounds, remains two periods more in the womb of Mother‐Nature before he is\r\nborn, or rather reborn a Dhyâni, still more perfect than he was before he\r\nlaunched forth as a Monad on the newly built Chain of Worlds. Let the\r\nstudent ponder over this mystery, and then he will easily convince himself\r\nthat, as there are also physical links between many classes, so there are\r\nprecise domains wherein the Astral merges into Physical Evolution. Of this\r\nScience breathes not one word. Man has evolved with and from the monkey,\r\nit says. But now see the contradiction.\r\n\r\nHuxley proceeds to point out plants, ferns, club‐mosses, some of them\r\ngenerically identical with those now living, which are met with in the\r\nCarboniferous epoch, for:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The cone of the oolitic Araucaria is hardly distinguishable from\r\n    that of existing species.... Sub‐kingdoms of animals yield the\r\n    same instances. The Globigerina of the Atlantic soundings is\r\n    identical with the cretaceous species of the same genus ... the\r\n    tabulate corals of the Silurian epoch are wonderfully like the\r\n    millepores of our own seas.... The Arachnida, the highest group of\r\n    which, the scorpions, is represented in the coal by a genus\r\n    differing from its living congeners only in ... the eyes. [etc.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of which may be closed with Dr. Carpenter’s authoritative statement\r\nabout the Foraminifera:\r\n\r\n\r\n    There is no evidence of any fundamental modification or advance in\r\n    the foraminiferous type from the palæozoic period to the present\r\n    time.... The foraminiferous fauna of our own series probably\r\n    present a greater range of variety than existed at any previous\r\n    period; but _there is no indication of any tendency to elevation\r\n    towards a higher type_.(584)\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, as in the Foraminifera, Protozoa of the lowest type of life,\r\nmouthless and eyeless, there is no indication of change except their now\r\ngreater variety—so man, who is on the uppermost rung of the ladder of\r\nbeing, indicates still less change, as we have seen; the skeleton of his\r\npalæolithic ancestor being even found superior in some respects to his\r\npresent frame. Where is, then, the uniformity of law which is claimed—the\r\n_absolute rule_ for one species shading off into another and thus, by\r\ninsensible gradations, into higher types? We see Sir William Thomson\r\nadmitting as much as 400,000,000 years for the time since the surface of\r\nthe Globe became sufficiently cool to permit of the presence of living\r\nthings;(585) and during that enormous lapse of time in the Oolitic period\r\nalone, the so‐called “Age of Reptiles,” we find a most extraordinary\r\nvariety and abundance of Saurian forms, the Amphibian type reaching _its\r\nhighest development_. We learn of Ichthyosauri and Plesiosauri in the\r\nlakes and rivers, and of winged crocodiles or lizards flying in the air.\r\nAfter which, in the Tertiary period:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We find the Mammalian type exhibiting remarkable divergences from\r\n    previously existing forms ... Mastodons, Megatheriums, and other\r\n    unwieldy denizens of the ancient forests and plains.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd, subsequently, we are notified of:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The gradual modification of one of the ramifications of the\r\n    Quadrumanous order, into those beings from whom primeval Man\r\n    himself may claim to have been evolved.(586)\r\n\r\n\r\nHe _may_; but no one, except a Materialist, can see why he should; as\r\nthere is not the slightest necessity for it, nor is such an evolution\r\nwarranted by facts, for those most interested in the proofs thereof\r\nconfess their utter failure to find one single fact to support their\r\ntheory. There is no need for the numberless types of life to represent the\r\nmembers of one progressive series. They are “the products of various and\r\ndifferent evolutional divergences, taking place now in one direction and\r\nnow in another.” Therefore it is far more justifiable to say that the\r\nmonkey evolved into the quadrumanous order, than that primeval man—who has\r\n_remained stationary_ in his human specialization since the first fossil\r\nskeleton found in the oldest strata, and of whom no variety is found save\r\nin colour and facial type—has developed from a common ancestor together\r\nwith the ape.\r\n\r\nThat man originates like other animals in a cell and develops “through\r\nstages indistinguishable from those of fish, reptile, and mammal until the\r\ncell attains the highly specialized development of the quadrumanous and\r\n_at last the human type_,” is an Occult axiom thousands of years old. The\r\nKabalistic axiom: “A stone becomes a plant; a plant a beast; a beast a\r\nman; a man a God,” holds good throughout the ages. Hæckel, in his\r\n_Schöpfungsgeschichte_, shows a double drawing representing two\r\nembryos—that of a dog six weeks old, and that of a man, eight weeks. The\r\ntwo, with the exception of a slight difference in the head, which is\r\nlarger and wider about the brain in the man, are indistinguishable.\r\n\r\n\r\n    In fact, we may say that every human being passes through the\r\n    stage of fish and reptile before arriving at that of mammal, and\r\n    finally of man.\r\n\r\n    If we take him up at the more advanced stage, where the embryo has\r\n    already passed the reptilian form, we find that for a considerable\r\n    time, the line of development remains the same as that of other\r\n    mammalia. The rudimentary limbs are exactly similar, the five\r\n    fingers and toes develop in the same way, and the resemblance\r\n    after the first four weeks’ growth _between the embryo of a man\r\n    and a dog is such that it is scarcely possible to distinguish\r\n    them_. Even at the age of eight weeks the embryo man is an animal\r\n    with a tail, hardly to be distinguished from an embryo puppy.(587)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy, then, not make man and dog evolve from a common ancestor, or from a\r\nreptile—a Nâga, instead of coupling man with the Quadrumana? This would be\r\njust as logical as the latter, if not more so. The shape and the stages of\r\nthe human embryo have not changed since historical times, and these\r\nmetamorphoses were known to Æsculapius and Hippocrates as well as to Mr.\r\nHuxley. Therefore, since the Kabalists had remarked it from prehistoric\r\ntimes, it is no new discovery.(588)\r\n\r\nAs the embryo of man has no more of the ape in it than of any other\r\nmammal, but contains in itself _the totality of the kingdoms of nature_,\r\nand since it seems to be a “persistent type” of life, far more so than\r\neven the Foraminifera, it seems as illogical to make him evolve from the\r\nape as it would be to trace his origin to the frog or the dog. Both Occult\r\nand Eastern Philosophies believe in Evolution, which Manu and Kapila(589)\r\ngive with far more clearness than any Scientist does at present. No need\r\nto repeat what has been fully debated in _Isis Unveiled_, as the reader\r\nmay find all these arguments and the description of the basis on which all\r\nthe Eastern doctrines of Evolution rest, in our earlier volumes.(590) But\r\nno Occultist can accept the unreasonable proposition that all the now\r\nexisting forms, “from the structureless Amœba to man,” are the direct\r\nlineal descendants of organisms which lived millions and millions of years\r\nbefore the birth of man, in the pre‐Silurian epochs, in the sea or land‐\r\nmud. The Occultists believe in an _Inherent Law of Progressive\r\nDevelopment_.(591) Mr. Darwin never did, and says so himself; for we find\r\nhim stating that, since _there can be no advantage_ “to the infusorian\r\nanimalcule or an intestinal worm ... to become highly organized,”\r\ntherefore, “natural selection,” _not necessarily including progressive\r\ndevelopment_—leaves the animalcule and the worm, the “persistent types,”\r\nquiet.(592)\r\n\r\nThere does not appear much _uniform_ law in such behaviour of Nature; and\r\nit looks more like the discriminative action of some _super_‐physical\r\nselection; perhaps, that aspect of Karma, which Eastern Occultists would\r\ncall the “Law of Retardation,” may have something to do with it.\r\n\r\nBut there is every reason to doubt whether Mr. Darwin himself ever gave\r\nsuch an importance to his law as is now given to it by his atheistic\r\nfollowers. The knowledge of the various living forms in the geological\r\nperiods that have gone by is very meagre. The reasons given for this by\r\nDr. Bastian are very suggestive:\r\n\r\n\r\n    First, on account of the imperfect manner in which the several\r\n    forms may be represented in the strata pertaining to the period;\r\n    secondly, on account of the extremely limited nature of the\r\n    explorations which have been made in these imperfectly\r\n    representative strata; and, thirdly, because so many parts of the\r\n    record are absolutely inaccessible to use—nearly all beneath the\r\n    Silurian system having been blotted out by time, whilst those two‐\r\n    thirds of the earth’s surface in which the remaining strata are to\r\n    be found are now covered over by seas. Hence Mr. Darwin says: “For\r\n    my part, following out Lyell’s metaphor, I look at the geological\r\n    record as a history of the world imperfectly kept, and written in\r\n    a changing dialect; _of this history we possess the last volume\r\n    alone_, relating only to two or three countries. Of this volume,\r\n    _only here and there a short chapter has been preserved_; and of\r\n    each page _only here and there a few lines_.”(593)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not on such meagre data, certainly, that the last word of Science\r\ncan be said. Nor is it on any ground of human pride, or unreasonable\r\nbelief in man’s representing even here on Earth—in _our_ period,\r\nperhaps—the highest type of life, that Occultism denies that all the\r\npreceding forms of human life belonged to types lower than our own; for it\r\nis not so. But simply because the “missing link,” which will prove the\r\nexisting theory undeniably, will never be found by Palæontologists.\r\nBelieving as we do that man has, during the preceding Rounds, evolved\r\nfrom, and passed through, the lowest forms of every life, vegetable and\r\nanimal, on Earth, there is nothing very degrading in the idea of having\r\nthe Orang Outang as an ancestor of our physical form. Quite the reverse;\r\nas it would most irresistibly forward the Occult Doctrine with regard to\r\nthe final evolution of everything in terrestrial nature into man. One may\r\neven enquire how it is that Biologists and Anthropologists, having once\r\nfirmly accepted the theory of the descent of man from the ape—how it is\r\nthat they have hitherto left untouched the future evolution of the\r\nexisting apes into man? This is only a logical sequence of the first\r\ntheory—unless Science would make of man a privileged being, and his\r\nevolution a _non_‐precedent in Nature, quite a _special_ and unique case.\r\nAnd that is what all this leads Physical Science to. The reason, however,\r\nwhy the Occultists reject the Darwinian, and especially the Hæckelian,\r\nhypothesis is because it is the ape, not man, which is, in sober truth, a\r\nspecial and unique instance. The Pithecoid is _an accidental creation_, a\r\nforced growth, the result of an unnatural process.\r\n\r\nThe Occult Doctrine is, we think, more logical. It teaches a cyclic, never\r\nvarying Law in Nature, the latter having no personal “special design,” but\r\nacting on a uniform plan that prevails through the whole Manvantaric\r\nperiod and deals with the land‐worm as it deals with man. Neither the one\r\nnor the other have sought to come into being, hence both are under the\r\nsame Evolutionary Law, and both have to progress according to Karmic Law.\r\nBoth have started from the same Neutral Centre of Life and both have to\r\nre‐merge into it at the consummation of the Cycle.\r\n\r\nIt is not denied that in the preceding Round man _was_ a gigantic ape‐like\r\ncreature; and when we say “man” we ought perhaps to say, the rough mould\r\nthat was developing for the use of man in this Round only—the middle, or\r\nthe transition, point of which we have hardly reached. Nor was man during\r\nthe first two and a half Root‐Races what he is now. That point he reached,\r\nas said before, only 18,000,000 years ago, during the Secondary period, as\r\nwe claim.\r\n\r\nTill then he was, according to tradition and Occult Teaching, “a God on\r\nEarth who had fallen into Matter,” or generation. This may or may not be\r\naccepted, since the Secret Doctrine does not impose itself as an\r\ninfallible dogma, and since, whether its prehistoric records are accepted\r\nor rejected, it has nothing to do with the question of the _actual_ Man\r\nand his Inner Nature; the Fall mentioned above having left no “original\r\nsin” on Humanity. But all this has been sufficiently dealt with.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we are taught that the transformations through which man\r\npassed on the descending arc—which is centrifugal for Spirit and\r\ncentripetal for Matter—and those he is preparing to go through,\r\nhenceforward, on his ascending path, which will reverse the direction of\r\nthe two forces—viz., Matter will become centrifugal and Spirit\r\ncentripetal—that all such transformations _are next in store for the\r\nanthropoid apes also_; all those, at any rate, who have reached the remove\r\nnext to man in this Round—for these will all be men in the Fifth Round,\r\njust as the present men inhabited ape‐like forms in the Third, the\r\npreceding Round.\r\n\r\nBehold, then, in the modern denizens of the great forests of Sumatra the\r\ndegraded and dwarfed examples—“blurred copies,” as Mr. Huxley has it—of\r\nourselves, as we (the majority of mankind) were in the earliest sub‐races\r\nof the Fourth Root‐Race during the period of what is called the “fall into\r\ngeneration.” The ape we know is not the product of natural evolution but\r\nan _accident_, a cross‐breed between an animal being, or form, and man. As\r\nhas been shown in the present volume, it is the speechless animal that\r\nfirst began sexual connection, for it was the first to separate into male\r\nand female. Nor was it intended by Nature that man should follow this\r\nbestial example—as is now shown by the comparatively painless procreation\r\nof their species by animals, and the terrible suffering and danger of the\r\nsame in woman. The ape is, indeed, as remarked in _Isis Unveiled_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    A transformation of species most directly connected with that of\r\n    the human family‐_a bastard branch engrafted on their own stock\r\n    before the final perfection of the latter_.(594)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe apes are millions of years later than the speaking human being, and\r\nare the latest contemporaries of our Fifth Race. Thus, it is most\r\nimportant to remember that the “Egos” of the apes are entities compelled\r\nby their Karma to incarnate in the animal forms, which resulted from the\r\nbestiality of the _latest_ Third and the earliest Fourth Race men. They\r\nare entities who had already reached the “human stage” before this Round.\r\nConsequently, they form an exception to the general rule. The numberless\r\ntraditions about Satyrs are no fables, but represent an extinct race of\r\nanimal men. The animal “Eves” were their foremothers, and the human\r\n“Adams” their forefathers; hence the Kabalistic allegory of Lilith or\r\nLilatu, Adam’s _first_ wife, whom the Talmud describes as a “charming”\r\nwoman, “with long wavy hair,” _i.e._—a female hairy animal of a character\r\nnow unknown, still a female animal, who in the Kabalistic and Talmudic\r\nallegories is called the female reflection of Samael, Samael‐Lilith, or\r\nman‐animal united, a being called, in the _Zohar_, Hayo Bischat, the Beast\r\nor Evil Beast. It is from this unnatural union that the present apes\r\ndescended. The latter are truly “speechless men,” and will become speaking\r\nanimals, or men of a lower order, in the Fifth Round, while the Adepts of\r\na certain School hope that some of the “Egos” of the apes of a higher\r\nintelligence will reäppear at the close of the Sixth Root‐Race. What their\r\nform will be is of secondary consideration. The form means nothing. Genera\r\nand species of the flora, fauna, and the highest animal, its crown—man,\r\nchange and vary according to the environments and climatic variations, not\r\nonly with every Round, but every Root‐Race likewise, as well as after\r\nevery geological cataclysm that puts an end to, or produces a turning\r\npoint in, the latter. In the Sixth Root‐Race, the fossils of the Orang,\r\nthe Gorilla and the Chimpanzee will be those of extinct quadrumanous\r\nmammals; and new forms—though fewer and ever wider apart as ages pass on\r\nand the close of the Manvantara approaches—will develop from the “cast\r\noff” types of the human races as they revert once again to astral, out of\r\nthe mire of physical, life. There were no apes before man, and they will\r\nbe extinct before the Seventh Race develops. Karma will lead on the Monads\r\nof the unprogressed men of our Race and lodge them in the newly evolved\r\nhuman frames of the thus physiologically regenerated Baboon.\r\n\r\nThis will take place, of course, millions of years hence. But the picture\r\nof this cyclic precession of all that lives and breathes now on Earth, of\r\neach species in its turn, is a true one, and needs no “special creation”\r\nor miraculous formation of man, beast, and plant _ex nihilo_.\r\n\r\nThis is how Occult Science explains the absence of any link between ape\r\nand man, and shows the former evolving from the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Panoramic View Of The Early Races.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a period of a few millions of years to cover between the first\r\n“mindless” race and the highly intelligent and intellectual later\r\nLemurians; there is another between the earliest civilization of the\r\nAtlanteans and the historic period.\r\n\r\nAs witnesses to the Lemurians but a few silent records in the shape of\r\nhalf a dozen broken colossi and old cyclopean ruins are left. These are\r\nnot allowed a hearing, as they are “productions of blind natural forces,”\r\nwe are assured by some; “quite modern” we are told by others. Tradition is\r\nleft contemptuously unnoticed by Sceptic and Materialist, and made\r\nsubservient to the _Bible_ in every case by the too zealous Churchman.\r\nWhenever a legend, however, refuses to fit in with the Noachian Deluge\r\ntheory, it is declared by the Christian clergy to be “the insanely\r\ndelirious voice of old superstition.” Atlantis is denied, when not\r\nconfused with Lemuria and other departed Continents, because, perhaps,\r\nLemuria is half the creation of Modern Science, and has, therefore, to be\r\nbelieved in; while Plato’s Atlantis is regarded by most of the Scientists\r\nas a dream.\r\n\r\nAtlantis is often described by believers in Plato as a prolongation of\r\nAfrica. An old continent is also suspected to have existed on the Eastern\r\ncoast. But Africa, as a continent, was never part and parcel of either\r\nLemuria or Atlantis, as we have agreed to call the Third and Fourth\r\nContinents. Their archaic appellations are never mentioned in the\r\n_Purânas_, nor anywhere else. But with only one of the Esoteric keys in\r\nhand, it becomes an easy task to identify these departed lands in the\r\nnumberless “Lands of the Gods,” Devas and Munis described in the\r\n_Purânas_, in their Varshas, Dvîpas, and Zones. Their Shveta‐dvîpa, during\r\nthe early days of Lemuria, stood out like a giant‐peak from the bottom of\r\nthe sea; the area between Atlas and Madagascar being occupied by the\r\nwaters till about the early period of Atlantis, after the disappearance of\r\nLemuria, when Africa emerged from the bottom of the ocean, and Atlas was\r\nhalf‐sunk.\r\n\r\nIt is of course impossible to attempt, within the compass of even several\r\nvolumes, a consecutive and detailed account of the evolution and progress\r\nof the first three Races‐except so far as to give a general view of it, as\r\nwill be done presently. Race the First had no history of its own. Of Race\r\nthe Second the same may be said. We shall have, therefore, to pay careful\r\nattention to the Lemurians and the Atlanteans only, before the history of\r\nour own Race, the Fifth, can be attempted.\r\n\r\nWhat is known of other Continents, besides our own, and what does history\r\nknow or accept of the early Races? Everything outside the repulsive\r\nspeculations of Materialistic Science is daubed with the contemptuous term\r\n“superstition.” The wise men of to‐day will believe nothing. Plato’s\r\n“winged” and “hermaphrodite” races, and his Golden Age, under the reign of\r\nSaturn and the Gods, are quietly brought back by Hæckel to their _new_\r\nplace in Nature; our Divine Races are shown to be the descendants of\r\nCatarrhine apes, and our ancestor, a piece of “sea slime”!\r\n\r\nNevertheless, as expressed by Faber:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The _fictions_ of ancient poetry ... will be found to comprehend\r\n    some portion of historical truth.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever one‐sided the efforts of the learned author of _A Dissertation on\r\nthe Mysteries of the Cabiri_—efforts directed throughout his two volumes\r\nto constrain the classical myths and symbols of old Paganism, “to bear\r\ntestimony to the truth of Scripture”—time and further research have\r\navenged, partially at least, that “truth” by showing it unveiled. Thus it\r\nis the clever adaptations of Scripture, on the contrary, which are made to\r\nbear evidence to the great wisdom of Archaic Paganism. This,\r\nnotwithstanding the inextricable confusion into which the truth about the\r\nKabiri—the most mysterious Gods of antiquity—has been thrown by the wild\r\nand contradictory speculations of Bishop Cumberland, Dr. Shuckford,\r\nCudworth, Vallancey, etc., and finally by Faber. Nevertheless, all of\r\nthese scholars, from first to last, had to come to a certain conclusion\r\nframed by the latter, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We have no reason to think that the idolatry of the Gentile world\r\n    was of a merely arbitrary contrivance; on the contrary, it seems\r\n    to have been built, almost universally, upon _a traditional\r\n    remembrance of certain real events. These events I apprehend to be\r\n    the destruction of the first_ [the Fourth in Esoteric Teaching]\r\n    _race of mankind by the waters of the Deluge_.(595)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this, Faber adds:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I am persuaded that the tradition of the sinking of the Phlegyan\r\n    isle is the very same as that of the sinking of the island\r\n    Atlantis. They both appear to me to allude to one great event, the\r\n    sinking of the whole world beneath the waters of the deluge, or,\r\n    if we suppose the arch of the earth to have remained in its\r\n    original position, the rising of the central water above it. M.\r\n    Bailly indeed in his work upon the Atlantis of Plato, the object\r\n    of which is evidently to depreciate the authority of the\r\n    scriptural chronology, labours to prove that the Atlantians were a\r\n    very ancient northern nation, long prior to the Hindoos, the\r\n    Phenicians, and the Egyptians.(596)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this Faber is in agreement with Bailly, who shows himself more learned\r\nand intuitional than those who accept biblical chronology. Nor is the\r\nlatter wrong when saying that the Atlanteans were the same as the Titans\r\nand the Giants.(597) Faber adopts the more willingly the opinion of his\r\nFrench _confrère_, as Bailly mentions Cosmas Indicopleustes, who preserved\r\nan ancient tradition about Noah—that he “formerly inhabited the _island_\r\nAtlantis.” This island, whether it was the “Poseidonis” mentioned in\r\n_Esoteric Buddhism_, or the Continent of Atlantis, does not much matter.\r\nThe tradition is there, recorded by a Christian.\r\n\r\nNo Occultist would ever think of dispossessing Noah of his prerogatives if\r\nhe is claimed to be an Atlantean; for this would simply show that the\r\nIsraelites repeated the story of Vaivasvata Manu, Xisuthrus, and so many\r\nothers, and that they only changed the name, which they had the same right\r\nto do as any other nation or tribe. What we object to is the literal\r\nacceptation of biblical chronology, as it is absurd, and in accord with\r\nneither geological data nor reason. Moreover, if Noah was an Atlantean,\r\nthen he was a Titan, a Giant, as Faber shows; and if a Giant, then why is\r\nhe not shown as such in _Genesis_?(598)\r\n\r\nBailly’s mistake was to reject the submersion of Atlantis, and to call the\r\nAtlanteans simply a Northern and _post‐diluvian_ nation, which, however,\r\nas he says, certainly flourished before the foundation of the Hindû,\r\nEgyptian, and Phœnician empires. In this, had he only known of the\r\nexistence of what we have agreed to call Lemuria, he would have again been\r\nright. For the Atlanteans were post‐diluvian to the Lemurians, and Lemuria\r\nwas not submerged as Atlantis was, but was _sunk_ under the waves, owing\r\nto earthquakes and subterranean fires, as Great Britain and Europe will be\r\none day. It is the ignorance of our men of Science, who will accept\r\nneither the tradition that several Continents have already sunk, nor the\r\nperiodical law which acts throughout the Manvantaric Cycle—it is this\r\nignorance that is the chief cause of all the confusion. Nor is Bailly\r\nwrong again in assuring us that the Hindûs, Egyptians, and Phœnicians came\r\nafter the Atlanteans, for the latter belonged to the Fourth, while the\r\nÂryans and their Semitic Branch are of the Fifth Race. Plato, while\r\nrepeating the story as narrated to Solon by the priests of Egypt,\r\nintentionally confuses—as every Initiate would—the two Continents, and\r\nassigns to the small island which last sunk, all the events pertaining to\r\nthe two enormous Continents, the prehistoric and traditional. Therefore,\r\nhe describes the _first couple_, from whom the whole island was peopled,\r\nas being formed of the Earth. In so saying, he means neither Adam and Eve,\r\nnor yet his own Hellenic forefathers. His language is simply allegorical,\r\nand by alluding to “Earth,” he means Matter, as the Atlanteans were really\r\nthe first purely _human_ and _terrestrial_ Race—those that preceded it\r\nbeing more divine and ethereal than human and solid.\r\n\r\nYet Plato must have known, as would any other initiated Adept, about the\r\nhistory of the Third Race after its “Fall,” though as one pledged to\r\nsilence and secrecy he never showed his knowledge in so many words.\r\nNevertheless, it may become easier now, after acquainting oneself with\r\neven the approximate chronology of the Eastern nations—all of which was\r\nbased upon, and followed the early Âryan calculations—to realize the\r\nimmense periods of time that must have elapsed since the separation of the\r\nsexes, without mentioning the First or even the Second Root‐Races. As\r\nthese must remain beyond the comprehension of minds trained in Western\r\nthought, it is found useless to speak in detail of the First and Second,\r\nand even of the Third Race in its earliest stage.(599) It is only when the\r\nlatter has reached its full human period that a beginning can be made,\r\nwithout the uninitiated reader finding himself hopelessly bewildered.\r\n\r\nThe Third Race _fell_—and created no longer; it _begat_ its progeny. Being\r\nstill mindless at the period of separation, it begat, moreover, anomalous\r\noffspring, until its physiological nature had adjusted its instincts in\r\nthe right direction. Like the “Lords Gods” of the _Bible_, the “Sons of\r\nWisdom,” the Dhyân Chohans, had warned it to leave alone the fruit\r\nforbidden by Nature; but the warning proved of no value. Men realized the\r\nunfitness—we must not say sin—of what they had done, only when too late;\r\nafter the Angelic Monads from higher Spheres had incarnated in, and\r\nendowed them with understanding. To that day they had remained simply\r\nphysical, like the animals generated from them. For what is the\r\ndistinction? The Doctrine teaches that the only difference between animate\r\nand inanimate objects on Earth, between an animal and a human frame, is\r\nthat in some the various “Fires” are latent, and in others they are\r\nactive. The _Vital_ Fires are in all things and not an atom is devoid of\r\nthem. But no animal has the three higher “principles” awakened in him;\r\nthey are simply potential, latent, and thus _non‐existing_. And so would\r\nthe animal frames of men be to this day, had they been left as they came\r\nout from the bodies of their Progenitors, whose Shadows they were, to\r\ngrow, unfolded only by the powers and forces immanent in Matter. But as\r\nsaid in _Pymander_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    This is a Mystery that to this day was sealed and hidden.\r\n    Nature(600) being mingled with Man(601) brought forth a wondrous\r\n    miracle; the harmonious commingling of the _essence of the Seven_\r\n    [Pitris, or Governors] and her own; the _Fire_ and the _Spirit_\r\n    and _Nature_ [the Noumenon of Matter]; which [commingling]\r\n    forthwith brought forth seven men of opposite sexes [negative and\r\n    positive] according to the essences of the Seven Governors.(602)\r\n\r\n\r\nThus saith Hermes, the thrice great Initiate,(603) the “Power of the\r\nThought Divine.” St. Paul, another Initiate, called our World, “the\r\nenigmatical mirror of pure truth,” and St. Gregory of Nazianzen\r\ncorroborated Hermes by stating that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Things visible are but the shadow and delineation of things that\r\n    we cannot see.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is an eternal combination, and images are repeated from the higher rung\r\nof the Ladder of Being down to the lower. The “Fall of the Angels,” and\r\nthe “War in Heaven” are repeated on every plane, the lower “mirror”\r\ndisfiguring the image of the superior “mirror,” and each repeating it in\r\nits own way. Thus the Christian dogmas are but the reminiscences of the\r\nparadigms of Plato, who spoke of these things cautiously, as every\r\nInitiate would. But it is all as expressed in these few sentences of the\r\n_Desatir_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    All that is on earth, saith the Lord [Ormazd], is the _shadow of\r\n    something that is in the superior spheres_. This luminious object\r\n    [light, fire, etc.] is the shadow of that which is still more\r\n    luminous than itself, and so on till it reaches me, who am the\r\n    light of lights.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Kabalistic books, in the _Zohar_ prëeminently, the idea that every\r\nobjective thing on Earth or in this Universe is the “Shadow” (Dyooknah) of\r\nthe eternal Light or Deity, is very strong.\r\n\r\nThe Third Race was prëeminently the bright “Shadow,” at first, of the\r\nGods, whom tradition exiles on to the Earth after the allegorical War in\r\nHeaven. This became still more allegorical on Earth, for it was the War\r\nbetween Spirit and Matter. This War will last till the Inner and Divine\r\nMan adjusts his outer terrestrial self to his own spiritual nature. Till\r\nthen the dark and fierce passions of that self will be at eternal feud\r\nwith his Master, the Divine Man. But the animal will be tamed one day,\r\nbecause its nature will be changed, and harmony will reign once more\r\nbetween the two as before the “Fall,” when even mortal man was “created”\r\nby the Elements and was not born.\r\n\r\nThe above is made clear in all the great Theogonies, principally in the\r\nGrecian, as in that of Hesiod. The _mutilation_ of Uranus by his son\r\nCronus, who thus condemns him to impotency, has never been understood by\r\nthe modern Mythographers. Yet, it is very plain; and as it was\r\nuniversal(604) it must have contained a great abstract and philosophical\r\nidea, now lost to our modern sages. This punishment in the allegory marks,\r\nindeed, “a new period, a second phase in the development of creation,” as\r\njustly remarked by Decharme,(605) who, however, does not attempt to\r\nexplain it. Uranus tried to oppose an impediment to that development, or\r\nnatural evolution, by _destroying all his children as soon as born_.\r\nUranus, who personifies all the creative powers of, and in, Chaos—Space,\r\nor the Unmanifested Deity—is thus made to pay the penalty; for it is these\r\npowers which cause the Pitris to evolve primordial “men” from\r\nthemselves—as, later on, these men, in their turn, evolve _their_\r\nprogeny—without any sense or desire for procreation. The work of\r\ngeneration, suspended for a moment, passes into the hands of Cronus\r\n(_Chronos_) Time,(606) who unites himself with Rhea (the Earth—‐in\r\nEsotericism, Matter in general), and thus produces celestial and\r\nterrestrial Titans. The whole of this symbolism relates to the mysteries\r\nof evolution.\r\n\r\nThis allegory is the exoteric version of the Esoteric Doctrine given in\r\nthis part of our work. For in Cronus we see the same story repeated again.\r\nAs Uranus destroyed his children by Gæa (one in the world of manifestation\r\nwith Aditi, or the Great Cosmic Deep), by confining them in the bosom of\r\nthe Earth, Titæa, so Cronus, at this second stage of creation, destroyed\r\nhis children by Rhea—by devouring them. This is an allusion to the\r\nfruitless efforts of Earth, or Nature, alone to create real _human_\r\n“men.”(607) Time swallows its own fruitless work. Then comes Zeus,\r\nJupiter, who dethrones his father in his turn.(608) Jupiter the Titan, is\r\nPrometheus, in one sense,(609) and varies from Zeus, the great “Father of\r\nthe Gods.” He is the “disrespectful son” in Hesiod. Hermes calls him the\r\n“Heavenly Man” in _Pymander_; and even in the _Bible_ he is found again\r\nunder the name of Adam, and, later on—by transmutation—under that of Ham.\r\nYet these are all personifications of the “Sons of Wisdom.” The necessary\r\ncorroboration that Jupiter belongs to the purely _human_ Atlantean\r\nCycle—if Uranus and Cronus who precede him are found insufficient—may be\r\nread in Hesiod, who tells us that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Immortals made the race of the Golden and Silver Age [First\r\n    and Second Races]; Jupiter made the generation of Bronze [an\r\n    admixture of _two_ elements], that of the Heroes, and of the Iron\r\n    Age.(610)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this he sends his fatal present, Pandora, to Epimetheus.(611) Hesiod\r\ncalls this present of the _first woman_ “a fatal gift.” It was a\r\npunishment, he explains, sent to man “for the theft of [divine creative]\r\nfire.” Her apparition on Earth is the signal for every kind of evil.\r\nBefore her appearance, the human races lived happy, exempt from sickness\r\nand suffering—as the same races are made to live under Yima’s rule, in the\r\nMazdean _Vendidâd_.\r\n\r\nTwo Deluges may also be traced, in universal tradition, by carefully\r\ncomparing Hesiod, the _Rig Veda_, the _Zend Avesta_, etc., but no _first_\r\nman is ever mentioned in any of the Theogonies save in the _Bible_.(612)\r\nEverywhere the man of _our_ Race appears after a cataclysm of water. After\r\nthis, tradition mentions only the several designations of continents and\r\nislands which sink under the ocean waves in due time.(613) Gods and\r\nmortals have one common origin according to Hesiod;(614) and Pindar echoes\r\nthe statement.(615) Deucalion and Pyrrha, who escape the Deluge by\r\nconstructing an Ark like Noah’s,(616) ask Jupiter to reänimate the human\r\nrace whom he had made to perish under the waters of the Flood. In the\r\nSlavonian mythology all men are drowned, and two old people, a man and his\r\nwife, alone remain. Then Pram’zimas, the “master of all,” advises them to\r\njump seven times on the rocks of the Earth, and seven new races (couples)\r\nare born, from which come the nine Lithuanian tribes.(617) As well\r\nunderstood by the author of _Mythologie de la Grèce Antique_—the Four Ages\r\nsignify periods of time, and are also an allegorical allusion to the\r\nRaces. As he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The successive races, destroyed and replaced by others, without\r\n    any period of transition, are characterized in Greece by the name\r\n    of metals, to express their ever‐decreasing value. Gold, the most\r\n    brilliant and precious of all, symbol of brightness ... qualifies\r\n    the first race.... The men of the second race, those of the Age of\r\n    Silver, are already far inferior to the first. Inert and weak\r\n    creatures, all their life is no better than a long and stupid\r\n    infancy.... They disappear.... The men of the Age of Bronze are\r\n    robust and violent [the Third Race]; ... their strength is\r\n    extreme. “They had arms made of bronze, habitations of bronze;\r\n    used nought but bronze. Iron, the black metal, was yet\r\n    unknown.”(618) The fourth race is, with Hesiod, that of the heroes\r\n    who fell before Thebes,(619) or under the walls of Troy.(620)\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, as the four Races are found mentioned by the oldest Greek poets,\r\nthough very much confused and anachronistically, our doctrines are once\r\nmore corroborated in the classics. But this is all “mythology” and poetry.\r\nWhat can Modern Science have to say to such a euhemerization of old\r\nfictions? The verdict is not difficult to foresee. Therefore, an attempt\r\nmust be made to answer by anticipation, and to prove that so much of the\r\ndomain of this same Science is taken up by fictions and empirical\r\nspeculations that none of the men of learning have the slightest right,\r\nwith such a heavy beam in their own eye, to point to the speck in the eye\r\nof the Occultist, even supposing that speck were not a figment of their\r\nown imagination.\r\n\r\n40. THEN THE THIRD AND FOURTH(621) BECAME TALL WITH PRIDE. “WE ARE THE\r\nKINGS;(622) WE ARE THE GODS” (_A_).\r\n\r\n41. THEY TOOK WIVES FAIR TO LOOK UPON. WIVES FROM THE MINDLESS, THE\r\nNARROW‐HEADED. THEY BRED MONSTERS, WICKED DEMONS, MALE AND FEMALE, ALSO\r\nKHADO,(623) WITH LITTLE MINDS (_B_).\r\n\r\n42. THEY BUILT TEMPLES FOR THE HUMAN BODY. MALE AND FEMALE THEY WORSHIPPED\r\n(_C_). THEN THE THIRD EYE ACTED NO LONGER (_D_).\r\n\r\n(_a_) Such were the first truly physical men, whose first characteristic\r\nwas—pride! It is the memory of this Third Race and the gigantic\r\nAtlanteans, which has lingered from one generation and race to another\r\ngeneration and race down to the days of Moses, and has found an objective\r\nform in those antediluvian giants, those terrible sorcerers and magicians,\r\nof whom the Roman Church has preserved such vivid, and at the same time\r\ndistorted, legends. Anyone who has read and studied the Commentaries on\r\nthe Archaic Doctrine, will easily recognize in some of these Atlanteans\r\nthe prototypes of the Nimrods, the Builders of the Tower of Babel, the\r\nHamites, and all those _tutti quanti_ of “accursed memory,” as theological\r\nliterature expresses it; of those, in short, who have furnished posterity\r\nwith the orthodox types of Satan. And this naturally leads us to enquire\r\ninto the religious ethics of these early Races, mythical as they may be.\r\n\r\nWhat was the religion of the Third and Fourth Races? In the common\r\nacceptation of the term, neither the Lemurians, nor yet their progeny, the\r\nLemuro‐Atlanteans, had any; for they knew no dogma, nor had they to\r\nbelieve _on faith_. No sooner had the mental eye of man been opened to\r\nunderstanding, than the Third Race felt itself one with the ever‐present,\r\nas also the ever to be unknown and invisible, All, the One Universal\r\nDeity. Endowed with divine powers, and feeling in himself his _inner_ God,\r\neach felt he was a Man‐God in his nature, though an animal in his physical\r\nself. The struggle between the two began from the very day they tasted of\r\nthe fruit of the Tree of Wisdom; a struggle for life between the spiritual\r\nand the psychic, the psychic and the physical. Those who conquered the\r\nlower “principles” by obtaining mastery over the body, joined the “Sons of\r\nLight.” Those who fell victims to their lower natures, became the slaves\r\nof Matter. From “Sons of Light and Wisdom” they ended by becoming the\r\n“Sons of Darkness.” They fell in the battle of mortal life with Life\r\nImmortal, and all those so fallen became the seed of the future\r\ngenerations of Atlanteans.(624)\r\n\r\nAt the dawn of his consciousness, the man of the Third Root‐Race had thus\r\nno beliefs that could be called _religion_. That is to say, he was not\r\nonly ignorant of “gay religions, full of pomp and gold” but even of any\r\nsystem of faith or outward worship. But if the term is to be defined as\r\nthe binding together of the masses in one form of reverence paid to those\r\nwe feel higher than ourselves, of piety—as a feeling expressed by a child\r\ntoward a loved parent—then even the earliest Lemurians from the very\r\nbeginning of their intellectual life, had a religion, and a most beautiful\r\none. Had they not their bright Gods of the Elements around them, and even\r\nwithin themselves?(625) Was not their childhood passed with, nursed and\r\ntended by, those who had given them being and called them forth to\r\nintelligent, conscious life? We are assured it was so, and we believe it.\r\nFor the evolution of Spirit into Matter could never have been achieved,\r\nnor would it have received its first impulse, had not the bright Spirits\r\nsacrificed their own respective super‐ethereal essences to animate the man\r\nof clay, by endowing each of his inner “principles” with a portion, or\r\nrather, a reflection, of that essence. The Dhyânîs of the Seven\r\nHeavens—the seven planes of Being—are the Noumena of the actual and the\r\nfuture Elements, just as the Angels of the Seven Powers of Nature—the\r\ngrosser effects of which we perceive in what Science is pleased to call\r\n“modes of motion,” the imponderable forces and what not—are the still\r\nhigher Noumena of still higher Hierarchies.\r\n\r\nIt was the “Golden Age” in those days of old, the Age when the “Gods\r\nwalked the earth, and mixed freely with the mortals.” When it ceased, the\r\nGods departed—_i.e._, became invisible—and later generations ended by\r\nworshipping their kingdoms—the Elements.\r\n\r\nIt was the Atlanteans, the first progeny of semi‐divine man after his\r\nseparation into sexes—hence the first‐begotten and humanly‐born\r\nmortals—who became the first “sacrificers” to the _God of Matter_. They\r\nstand, in the dim far‐away past, in ages more than prehistoric, as the\r\nprototype on which the great symbol of Cain was built,(626) as the first\r\nAnthropomorphists who worshipped Form and Matter—a worship which very soon\r\ndegenerated into _self‐worship_, and thence led to phallicism, which\r\nreigns supreme to this day in the symbolism of every exoteric religion of\r\nritual, dogma, and form. Adam and Eve _became matter_, or furnished the\r\nsoil, Cain and Abel—the latter the life‐bearing soil, the former “the\r\ntiller of that ground or field.”\r\n\r\nThus the first Atlantean races, born on the Lemurian Continent, separated\r\nfrom their earliest tribes into the righteous and the unrighteous; into\r\nthose who worshipped the one unseen Spirit of Nature, the Ray of which man\r\nfeels within himself—or the Pantheists, and those who offered fanatical\r\nworship to the Spirits of the Earth, the dark, cosmic, anthropomorphic\r\nPowers, with whom they made alliance. These were the earliest Gibborim,\r\nthe “mighty men ... of renown” in those days,(627) who become with the\r\nFifth Race the Kabirim, Kabiri with the Egyptians and the Phœnicians,\r\nTitans with the Greeks, and Râkshasas and Daityas with the Indian races.\r\n\r\nSuch was the secret and mysterious origin of all the subsequent and modern\r\nreligions, especially of the worship of the later Hebrews for their tribal\r\nGod. At the same time this sexual religion was closely allied to, based\r\nupon, and, so to say, blended with, astronomical phenomena. The Lemurians\r\ngravitated toward the North Pole, or the Heaven of their Progenitors—the\r\nHyperborean Continent; the Atlanteans, toward the South Pole, the “_Pit_,”\r\ncosmically and terrestrially—whence breathe the hot passions blown into\r\nhurricanes by the cosmic Elementals, whose abode it is. The two Poles were\r\ndenominated, by the Ancients, Dragons and Serpents—hence good and bad\r\nDragons and Serpents, and also the names given to the “Sons of God”—Sons\r\nof Spirit and Matter—the good and bad Magicians. This is the origin of the\r\ndual and triple nature in man. The legend of the “Fallen Angels” in its\r\nEsoteric signification, contains the key to the manifold contradictions of\r\nhuman character; it points to the secret of man’s self‐consciousness; it\r\nis the support on which hinges his entire Life‐Cycle—the history of his\r\nevolution and growth.\r\n\r\nOn a firm grasp of this doctrine depends the correct understanding of\r\nEsoteric Anthropogenesis. It gives a clue to the vexed question of the\r\nOrigin of Evil; and shows how man himself is the separator of the One into\r\nvarious contrasted aspects.\r\n\r\nThe reader, therefore, will not be surprised if so much space is devoted\r\nto an attempt to elucidate this difficult and obscure subject every time\r\nit presents itself. A good deal must necessarily be said on its\r\nsymbological aspect; because, by so doing, hints are given to the\r\nthoughtful student for his own investigations, and more light can thus be\r\nsuggested than it is possible to convey in the technical phrases of a more\r\nformal, philosophical exposition. The “Fallen Angels,” so‐called, are\r\n_Humanity_ itself. The Demon of Pride, Lust, Rebellion, and Hatred, had no\r\nbeing _before_ the appearance of physical conscious man. It is man who has\r\nbegotten and nurtured the fiend, and allowed it to develop in his heart;\r\nit is he, again, who has contaminated the Indwelling God in himself, by\r\nlinking the pure Spirit with the impure Demon of Matter. And, if the\r\nKabalistic saying, “_Demon est Deus inversus_,” finds its metaphysical and\r\ntheoretical corroboration in dual manifested Nature, nevertheless, its\r\npractical application is found in Mankind alone.\r\n\r\nThus it has now become self‐evident that, postulating as we do, (_a_) the\r\nappearance of Man before that of other Mammalia, and even before the Ages\r\nof the huge Reptiles; (_b_) Periodical Deluges and Glacial Periods owing\r\nto the Karmic disturbance of the axis; and chiefly (_c_) the birth of man\r\nfrom a Superior Being, or what Materialism would call a “supernatural”\r\nBeing, though it is only super‐_human_—our teachings have very few chances\r\nof an impartial hearing. Add to it the claim that a portion of Mankind in\r\nthe Third Race—all those Monads of men who had reached the highest point\r\nof Merit and Karma in the preceding Manvantara—owed their psychic and\r\nrational natures to divine Beings “hypostasizing” into their Fifth\r\nPrinciples, and the Secret Doctrine must lose caste in the eyes of not\r\nonly Materialism but even of dogmatic Christianity. For, no sooner will\r\nthe latter have learned that these Angels are identical with their\r\n“Fallen” Spirits, than the Esoteric tenet will be proclaimed most terribly\r\nheretical and pernicious.(628) The _Divine_ Man dwelt in the animal, and\r\ntherefore, when the physiological separation took place in the natural\r\ncourse of evolution—when also “all the animal creation was _untied_,” and\r\nmales were attracted to females—_that race fell_; not because they had\r\neaten of the Fruit of Knowledge and knew Good from Evil, but because they\r\nknew no better. Propelled by the sexless creative instinct, the early sub‐\r\nraces had evolved an intermediate race in which, as hinted in the Stanzas,\r\nthe higher Dhyân Chohans had incarnated.(629) “When we have ascertained\r\nthe extent of the universe (and learnt to know all that there is in it) we\r\nwill multiply our race,” answer the Sons of Will and Yoga to their\r\nbrethren of the same race, who invite them to do as they do. This means\r\nthat the great Adepts and Initiated Ascetics will “multiply,” _i.e._, once\r\nmore produce “mind‐born” immaculate sons—in the Seventh Root‐Race.\r\n\r\nIt is so stated in the _Vishnu_ and _Brahmâ Purânas_, in the\r\n_Mahâbhârata_(630) and in the _Harivamsha_. In one portion of the\r\n_Pushkara Mâhâtmya_, moreover, the separation of the sexes is allegorized\r\nby Daksha, who, seeing that his will‐born progeny, the “Sons of passive\r\nYoga,” will not create men, “_converts half himself into a female_ by whom\r\nhe begets daughters,” the future females of the Third Race which begat the\r\nGiants of Atlantis, the Fourth Race, so called. In the _Vishnu Purâna_ it\r\nis simply said that Daksha, the father of mankind, established sexual\r\nintercourse as the means of peopling the world.(631)\r\n\r\nHappily for the Human Race the “Elect Race” had already become the vehicle\r\nof incarnation of the highest Dhyânîs (intellectually and spiritually)\r\nbefore Humanity had become quite material. When the last sub‐races—save\r\nsome of the lowest—of the Third Race had perished with the great Lemurian\r\nContinent, the “Seeds of the _Trinity of Wisdom_” had already acquired the\r\nsecret of immortality on Earth, that gift which allows the same Great\r\nPersonality to step _ad libitum_ from one worn‐out body into another.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The first War that Earth knew, the first shedding of human gore, was\r\nthe result of man’s eyes and senses being opened, which made him see that\r\nthe daughters of his brethren were fairer than his own—and their wives\r\nalso. There were rapes committed before that of the Sabines, and\r\nMenelauses robbed of their Helens before the Fifth Race was born. The\r\nTitans or Giants were the stronger; their adversaries, the wiser. This\r\ntook place during the Fourth Race—that of the Giants.\r\n\r\nFor “there _were_ Giants” in the days of old, indeed.(632) The\r\nevolutionary series of the animal world is a warrant that the same thing\r\ntook place within the human races. Lower still in the order of creation we\r\nfind witnesses for the same proportionate size in the flora going _pari\r\npassu_ with the fauna. The pretty ferns we collect and dry among the\r\nleaves of our favourite volumes are the descendants of the gigantic ferns\r\nwhich grew during the Carboniferous period.\r\n\r\nScriptures, and fragments of philosophical and scientific works—in short,\r\nalmost every record that has come down to us from antiquity—contain\r\nreferences to Giants. No one can fail to recognize the Atlanteans of the\r\nSecret Doctrine in the Râkshasas of Lankâ—the opponents conquered by Râma.\r\nAre these accounts no better than the production of empty fancy? Let us\r\ngive the subject a few moments’ attention.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre Giants A Fiction?\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, again, we come into collision with Science, which so far denies that\r\nman has ever been much larger than the average of tall and powerful men\r\nnow met with occasionally. Dr. Henry Gregor denounces the traditions of\r\nGiants as resting upon ill‐digested facts, and instances of mistaken\r\njudgments are brought forward as disproof of such traditions. Thus, in\r\n1613, in a locality, called from time immemorial the “Field of Giants,” in\r\nLower Dauphiné, France, four miles from St. Romans, enormous bones were\r\nfound deeply buried in the sandy soil. They were attributed to human\r\nremains, and even to Teutobodus, the Teuton chief slain by Marius. But\r\nCuvier’s later research proved them to be the fossil remains of the\r\nDinotherium Giganteum, 18 feet long. Ancient buildings are pointed to as\r\nan evidence that our earliest ancestors were not much larger than we are,\r\nthe entrance doors being of no larger size then than now. The tallest man\r\nof antiquity known to us, we are told, was the Roman Emperor Maximus,\r\nwhose height was only seven and a half feet. Nevertheless, in our modern\r\nday, every year we see men taller than this. The Hungarian who exhibited\r\nhimself in the London Pavilion was nearly 9 feet high. In America a giant\r\nwas shown 9 feet 6 inches tall; the Montenegrin Danilo was 8 feet 7\r\ninches. In Russia and Germany one often sees men in the lower classes\r\nabove 7 feet. Now, as the ape‐theorists are told by Mr. Darwin that the\r\nspecies of animals which result from cross breeding always betray “_a\r\ntendency to revert to the original type_,” they ought to apply the same\r\nlaw to men. Had there been no giants as a type in ancient days, there\r\nwould be none now.\r\n\r\nAll this applies only to the historic period. And if the skeletons of the\r\nprehistoric ages have failed so far to prove undeniably in the opinion of\r\nScience the claim here advanced, it is but a question of time. We,\r\nhowever, positively deny the reality of the failure. Moreover, as already\r\nstated, human stature is little changed since the last Racial Cycle. The\r\ngiants of old are all buried under the oceans, and hundreds of thousands\r\nof years of constant friction by water would reduce to dust a brazen, much\r\nmore a human skeleton. And whence the testimony of well‐known classical\r\nwriters, of philosophers and men who, otherwise, never had the reputation\r\nfor lying? Let us bear in mind, furthermore, that before the year 1847,\r\nwhen Boucher de Perthes forced it upon the attention of Science, hardly\r\nanything was known of fossil man, for Archæology complacently ignored his\r\nexistence. Of giants who were “in the earth in those days” of old, the\r\n_Bible_ alone had spoken to the wise men of the West; the Zodiac being the\r\nsolitary witness called upon to corroborate the statement in the persons\r\nof Orion or Atlas, whose mighty shoulders were said to support the world.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, even the giants have not been left without their witnesses,\r\nand one may as well examine both sides of the question. The three\r\nSciences—geological, sidereal and scriptural, the latter in its universal\r\ncharacter—may furnish us with the needed proofs. To begin with Geology: it\r\nhas already confessed that the older the excavated skeletons, the larger,\r\ntaller and the more powerful their structure. This is already a certain\r\nproof in hand. Frédéric de Rougemont, who, though believing too piously in\r\nthe _Bible_ and Noah’s Ark, is none the less a scientific witness, writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n    All those bones, found in the Departments of the Gard, in Austria,\r\n    Liège, etc., those skulls which all remind one of the negro type\r\n    ... and which by reason of their type might be mistaken for\r\n    animals, have all belonged to men of _high stature_.(633)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same is repeated by Lartet, an authority, who attributes a “tall\r\nstature” to those who were submerged in the Deluge—not necessarily\r\n“Noah’s”—and a smaller stature to the races which lived subsequently.\r\n\r\nAs for the evidence furnished by ancient writers, we need not trouble\r\nourselves with that of Tertullian, who assures us that in his day a number\r\nof giants were found at Carthage—for, before his testimony can be\r\naccepted, his own identity,(634) if not actual existence, would have to be\r\nproven. We may, however, turn to the papers of 1858, which speak of a\r\n“sarcophagus of giants” found that year on the site of this same city. As\r\nto the ancient Pagan writers, we have the evidence of Philostratus, who\r\nspeaks of a giant skeleton twenty‐two cubits long, as well as of another\r\nof twelve cubits, seen by himself on the promontory of Sigæum. This\r\nskeleton may perhaps not have belonged, as believed by Protesilas, to the\r\ngiant killed by Apollo at the siege of Troy; nevertheless, it was that of\r\na giant, as was that of the other discovered by Messecrates of Stira, in\r\nLemnos—“horrible to behold,” according to Philostratus.(635) Is it\r\npossible that prejudice would carry Science so far as to class _all_ these\r\nmen as either fools or liars?\r\n\r\nPliny speaks of a giant in whom he thought he recognized Orion, or Otus,\r\nthe brother of Ephialtes.(636) Plutarch declares that Sertorius saw the\r\ntomb of Antæus, the Giant; and Pausanias vouches for the actual existence\r\nof the tombs of Asterius and of Geryon, or of Hillus, son of Hercules—all\r\nGiants, Titans and mighty men. Finally the Abbé Pegues, affirms in his\r\ncurious work, _Les Volcans de la Grèce_, that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the neighbourhood of the volcanoes of the isle of Thera, giants\r\n    with enormous skulls were found laid out under colossal stones,\r\n    the erection of which in every place must have necessitated the\r\n    use of titanic powers, and which tradition associates in all\r\n    countries with the ideas about giants, volcanoes and magic.(637)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same work above cited, the author wonders why in the _Bible_ and\r\ntradition the Gibborim, the giants or the “mighty ones,” the Rephaim, the\r\nspectres or the “phantoms,” the Nephilim, or the “fallen ones”\r\n(_irruentes_), are shown as if identical, though they are “all _men_,”\r\nsince the _Bible_ calls them the primitive and the mighty ones—_e.g._,\r\nNimrod. The Secret Doctrine explains the secret. These names, which belong\r\nby right only to the four preceding Races and the earliest beginning of\r\nthe Fifth, allude very clearly to the first two _Phantom_ (Astral) Races,\r\nto the “Fallen” Race—the Third, and to the Race of the Atlantean\r\nGiants—the Fourth, after which “men began to decrease in stature.”\r\n\r\nBossuet sees the cause of subsequent universal idolatry in the “original\r\nsin.” “Ye shall be as Gods,” says the Serpent of _Genesis_ to Eve, thus\r\nlaying the first germ of the worship of _false divinities_.(638) Hence, he\r\nthinks, came idolatry, or the cult and adoration of _images_, of\r\nanthropomorphized or human figures. But, if it is this that idolatry is\r\nmade to rest upon, then the two Churches—the Greek, and the Latin\r\nespecially—are as idolatrous and pagan as any other religion.(639) It was\r\nonly in the Fourth Race that men, who had lost all right to be considered\r\ndivine, resorted to body worship, in other words to phallicism. Till then,\r\nthey had been truly Gods, as pure and as divine as their Progenitors, and\r\nthe expression of the allegorical “Serpent,” as has been sufficiently\r\nshown in the preceding pages, does not refer at all to the physiological\r\n“Fall” of men, but to their acquiring the Knowledge of Good and Evil; and\r\nthis knowledge came to them _prior_ to their fall. It must not be\r\nforgotten that it is only after his forced expulsion from Eden that “Adam\r\nknew Eve his wife.” We shall not, however, check the tenets of the Secret\r\nDoctrine by the dead‐letter of the Hebrew _Bible_, but rather point out\r\nthe great similarities between the two in their Esoteric meaning.\r\n\r\nIt was only after his defection from the Neo‐Platonists, that Clement of\r\nAlexandria began to translate _gigantes_ by _serpentes_, explaining that\r\n“serpents and giants signify _demons_.”(640)\r\n\r\nWe may be told that, before we draw parallels between our tenets and those\r\nof the _Bible_, we have to show better evidence of the existence of the\r\nGiants of the Fourth Race than the reference to them found in _Genesis_.\r\nWe answer, that the proofs we give are more satisfactory, at any rate are\r\nsupported by more literary and scientific evidence, than those of Noah’s\r\nDeluge will ever be. Even the historical works of China are full of such\r\nreminiscences about the Fourth Race. In the French translation of the\r\n_Shoo‐King_,(641) we read:\r\n\r\n\r\n    When the Miao‐tse (that antediluvian and perverted race [explains\r\n    the annotator] which retired in the days of old to the rocky\r\n    caves, and the descendants of whom are said to be still found in\r\n    the neighbourhood of Canton),(642) _according to our ancient\r\n    documents_, had, owing to the beguilements of Tchy‐Yeoo, troubled\r\n    all the earth, it became full of brigands.... The Lord (Chang‐ty\r\n    [a King of the _Divine_ Dynasty]) cast his eyes over the people,\r\n    and saw no longer among them any trace of virtue. Then he\r\n    commanded Tchong and Ly [two lower Dhyân Chohans] to cut away\r\n    every communication between heaven and earth. Since then, there\r\n    has been no more _going up and down_!(643)\r\n\r\n\r\n“Going up and down” means an untrammelled communication and intercourse\r\nbetween the two Worlds.\r\n\r\nAs we are not in a position to give out a full and detailed history of the\r\nThird and Fourth Races, as many isolated facts concerning them as are\r\npermitted must be now collated together, especially those corroborated by\r\ndirect as well as by inferential evidence found in ancient literature and\r\nhistory. As the “coats of skin” of men thickened, and they fell more and\r\nmore into physical sin, the intercourse between Physical and Ethereal\r\n_Divine_ Man was stopped. The Veil of Matter between the two planes became\r\ntoo dense for even the Inner Man to penetrate. The Mysteries of Heaven and\r\nEarth, revealed to the Third Race by their Celestial Teachers in the days\r\nof their purity, became a great focus of light, the rays from which became\r\nnecessarily weakened as they were diffused and shed upon an uncongenial,\r\nbecause too material, soil. With the masses they degenerated into Sorcery,\r\ntaking later on the shape of exoteric religions, of idolatry full of\r\nsuperstitions, and man‐, or hero‐worship. Alone a handful of primitive\r\nmen—in whom the spark of Divine Wisdom burnt bright, and became only\r\nstrengthened in its intensity as it got dimmer and dimmer with every age\r\nin those who turned it to evil purposes—remained the elect custodians of\r\nthe Mysteries revealed to mankind by the Divine Teachers. There were those\r\namong them, who remained in their Kaumâric condition from the beginning;\r\nand tradition whispers, what the Secret Teachings affirm, namely, that\r\nthese Elect were the germ of a Hierarchy _which has never died since that\r\nperiod_. As the _Catechism_ of the Inner Schools says:\r\n\r\n_The Inner Man of the First ... only changes his body from time to time;\r\nhe is ever the same, knowing neither rest nor Nirvâna, spurning Devachan\r\nand remaining constantly on Earth for the salvation of mankind.... Out of\r\nthe seven Virgin‐men [Kumâra]_(_644_)_ four sacrificed themselves for the\r\nsins of the world and the instruction of the ignorant, to remain till the\r\nend of the present Manvantara. Though unseen, they are ever present. When\r\npeople say of one of them, __“__He is dead__”__; behold, he is alive __\r\nand under another form. These are the Head, the Heart, the Soul, and the\r\nSeed of undying Knowledge [Jñâna]. Thou shall never speak, O Lanoo, of\r\nthese great ones [Mahâ ...] before a multitude, mentioning them by their\r\nnames. The wise alone will understand._(645)\r\n\r\nIt is these sacred “Four” who have been allegorized and symbolized in the\r\n_Linga Purâna_, which states that Vâmadeva (Shiva) as a Kumâra is reborn\r\nin each Kalpa (Race, in this instance), as four youths—four, white; four,\r\nred; four, yellow; and four, dark or brown. Let us remember that Shiva is\r\npreëminently and chiefly an ascetic, the patron of all Yogîs and Adepts,\r\nand the allegory will become quite comprehensible. It is the spirit of\r\nDivine Wisdom and chaste Asceticism itself which incarnates in these\r\nElect. It is only after _getting married_ and being dragged by the Gods\r\nfrom his terrible ascetic life, that Rudra becomes Shiva, a God—and not\r\none of a very virtuous or merciful type—in the Hindû Pantheon. Higher than\r\nthe “Four” is only ONE on Earth as in Heavens—that still more mysterious\r\nand solitary Being described in Volume I.\r\n\r\nWe have now to examine the nature of the “Sons of the Flame” and of “Dark\r\nWisdom,” as well as the _pros_ and _cons_ of the Satanic assumption.\r\n\r\nSuch broken sentences as could be made out from the fragments of the tile,\r\nwhich George Smith calls “The Curse after the Fall,”(646) are of course\r\nallegorical; yet they corroborate that which is taught of the true nature\r\nof the Fall of the Angels in our Books. Thus, it is said that the “Lord of\r\nthe Earth his name called out, the Father Elu [Elohim],” and pronounced\r\nhis “curse,” which “the God Hea heard, and his liver was angry, because\r\n_his_ man [Angelic Man] had corrupted his purity,” for which Hea expresses\r\nthe desire that “_wisdom and knowledge_ hostilely may they injure him\r\n[man].”(647)\r\n\r\nThe latter sentence points to the direct connection of the Chaldæan with\r\nthe Genetic account. While Hea tries to bring to nought the wisdom and\r\nknowledge gained by man, through his newly‐acquired intellectual and\r\nconscious capacity of creating in his turn—thus taking the monopoly of\r\ncreation out of the hands of God (the Gods)—the Elohim do the same in the\r\nthird chapter of _Genesis_. Therefore the Elohim sent him out of Eden.\r\n\r\nBut this was of no avail. For the Spirit of Divine Wisdom being upon and\r\n_in_ man—verily the Serpent of Eternity and all Knowledge, that Mânasic\r\nSpirit, which made him learn the secret of “creation” on the Kriyâshaktic,\r\nand of procreation on the Earthly planes—led him as naturally to discover\r\nhis way to immortality, notwithstanding the jealousy of all the Gods.\r\n\r\nThe early Atlanto‐Lemurians are charged with taking unto themselves (the\r\ndivine incarnations) wives of a lower race, namely, the race of the\r\nhitherto mindless men. Every ancient Scripture has the same, more or less\r\ndisfigured, legend. Primarily, the Angelic “Fall,” which has transformed\r\nthe “First‐born” of God into the Asuras, or into the Ahriman or Typhon of\r\nthe “Pagans”—_i.e._, if the accounts given in the _Book of Enoch_,(648)\r\nand in _Hermes_, in _Purânas_ and _Bible_ are taken literally—has, when\r\nread Esoterically, the following simple signification:\r\n\r\nSentences such as, “In his [Satan’s] ambition he raises his hand against\r\nthe Sanctuary of the God of Heaven,” etc., ought to read: Prompted by the\r\nLaw of Eternal Evolution and Karma, the Angel incarnated on Earth in Man;\r\nand as his Wisdom and Knowledge are still divine, although his Body is\r\nearthly, he is (allegorically) accused of divulging the Mysteries of\r\nHeaven. He combines and uses the two for purposes of human, instead of\r\nsuper‐human, procreation. Henceforth, “man will _beget_, not\r\n_create_.”(649) But as, by so doing, he has to use his weak Body as the\r\nmeans of procreation, that Body will pay the penalty for this Wisdom,\r\ncarried from Heaven down to the Earth; hence the corruption of physical\r\npurity will become a temporary curse.\r\n\r\nThe Mediæval Kabalists knew this well, since one of them did not fear to\r\nwrite:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Kabalah was first taught by God himself to a select Company of\r\n    Angels who formed a theosophic school in Paradise. After the Fall\r\n    the Angels most _graciously communicated this heavenly doctrine to\r\n    the disobedient child of Earth_, to furnish the protoplasts with\r\n    the means of returning to their pristine nobility and\r\n    felicity.(650)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis shows how the incident of the Sons of God, marrying and imparting the\r\nDivine Secrets of Heaven to the Daughters of Men—as allegorically told by\r\nEnoch and in the sixth chapter of _Genesis_—was interpreted by the\r\nChristian Kabalists. The whole of this period may be regarded as the\r\n_pre_‐human period, that of Divine Man, or as plastic Protestant Theology\r\nnow has it—the _Pre_‐Adamite period. But even _Genesis_ begins its _real_\r\nhistory (Chap. vi) by the giants of “those days” and the “sons of God”\r\nmarrying and teaching their wives—the “daughters of men.”\r\n\r\nThis period is the one described in the _Purânas_; and relating as it does\r\nto days lost in archaic ages, hence pre‐historic, how can any\r\nAnthropologist feel certain whether the mankind of that period was or was\r\nnot as he knows it now? The whole _personnel_ of the _Brâhmanas_ and\r\n_Purânas_—the Rishis, Prajâpatis, Manus, their wives and progeny—belong to\r\nthat pre‐human period. All these are the _Seed_ of Humanity, so to speak.\r\nIt is around these “Sons of God,” the “mind‐born” astral Children of\r\nBrahmâ, that our physical frames have grown and developed to what they are\r\nnow. For, the Paurânic histories of all those men are those of our Monads,\r\nin their various and numberless incarnations on this and other Spheres,\r\nevents perceived by the “Shiva Eye” of the ancient Seers—the “Third Eye”\r\nof our Stanzas—and described allegorically. Later on, they were disfigured\r\nfor sectarian purposes; mutilated, but still left with a considerable\r\nground‐work of truth in them. Nor is the philosophy less profound in such\r\nallegories for being so thickly veiled by the overgrowth of fancy.\r\n\r\nBut with the Fourth Race we reach the purely human period. Those who were\r\nhitherto semi‐divine Beings, self‐imprisoned in bodies which were human\r\nonly in appearance, became physiologically changed and took unto\r\nthemselves wives who were entirely human and fair to look upon, but in\r\nwhom _lower, more material_, though sidereal, Beings had incarnated. These\r\nBeings in female forms—Lilith is the prototype of them in the Jewish\r\ntraditions—are called in the Esoteric accounts Khado (Dâkinî, in\r\nSanskrit). Allegorical legends call the Chief of these Liliths Sangye\r\nKhado (Buddha Dâkinî, in Sanskrit); all are credited with the art of\r\n“walking in the air,” and the “greatest _kindness to mortals_;” but with\r\nno _mind_—only animal instinct.(651)\r\n\r\n(_c_) This is the beginning of a worship which, ages later, was doomed to\r\ndegenerate into phallicism and sexual worship. It began by the worship of\r\nthe human body—that “miracle of miracles,” as an English author calls\r\nit—and ended by that of its respective sexes. The worshippers were giants\r\nin stature; but they were not giants in knowledge and learning, though it\r\ncame to them more easily than it does to the men of our modern times.\r\nTheir science was innate in them. The Lemuro‐Atlantean had no need of\r\ndiscovering and fixing in his memory that which his informing principle\r\n_knew_ at the moment of its incarnation. Time alone, and the ever‐growing\r\nobtuseness of the Matter in which the “principles” had clothed themselves,\r\ncould, the one, weaken the memory of their pre‐natal knowledge, the other,\r\nblunt and even extinguish every spark of the spiritual and divine in them.\r\nTherefore had they, from the first, fallen victims to their animal natures\r\nand bred “monsters”—_i.e._, men of distinct varieties from themselves.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the Giants, Creuzer well describes them in saying that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Those children of Heaven and Earth were endowed at their birth by\r\n    the _Sovereign Powers_, the authors of their being, with\r\n    extraordinary faculties both moral and physical. They _commanded\r\n    the Elements, knew the secrets of Heaven and the Earth, of the sea\r\n    and the whole world, and read futurity in_ the stars.... It seems,\r\n    indeed, as though, when reading of them, one has to deal _not with\r\n    men as we are_ but with Spirits of the Elements sprung from the\r\n    bosom of Nature and having full sway over her.... All these beings\r\n    are marked with a character of _magic_ and _sorcery_....\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so they were, those now legendary heroes of the pre‐historic, still\r\nonce really existing, races. Creuzer was wise in his generation, for he\r\ndid not charge with deliberate deceit, or dulness and superstition, an\r\nendless series of recognized Philosophers, who mention these races and\r\nassert that, even in their own time, they had seen their fossils. There\r\nwere sceptics in days of old—as many and great as they are now. But even a\r\nLucian, a Democritus and an Epicurus, yielded to the evidence of _facts_\r\nand showed the discriminative capacity of really great intellects, which\r\ncan distinguish fiction from fact, and truth from exaggeration and fraud.\r\nAncient writers were no more fools than are our modern wise men; for, as\r\nwell remarked by the author of “Notes on Aristotle’s Psychology in\r\nRelation to Modern Thought,” in _Mind_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The common division of history into ancient and modern is ...\r\n    misleading. The Greeks in the fourth century, B.C., were in many\r\n    respects moderns; especially, we may add, in their scepticism.\r\n    They were not very likely to accept _fables_ so easily.\r\n\r\n\r\nYet the Lemurians and the Atlanteans, those “children of Heaven and\r\nEarth,” were indeed marked with a character of _sorcery_; for the Esoteric\r\nDoctrine charges them precisely with what, if believed, would put an end\r\nto the difficulties of Science with regard to the origin of man, or\r\nrather, his anatomical similarities to the anthropoid ape. It accuses them\r\nof having committed the (to us) abominable crime of breeding with so‐\r\ncalled “animals,” and thus producing a truly pithecoid species, now\r\nextinct. Of course, as also in the question of spontaneous generation—in\r\nwhich Esoteric Science believes, and which it teaches—the possibility of\r\nsuch a cross‐breed between man and an animal of any kind will be denied.\r\nBut apart from the consideration that in those early days, as already\r\nremarked, neither the human Atlantean Giants, nor yet the “animals,” were\r\nthe physiologically perfect men and mammalians that are now known to us,\r\nthe modern notions upon this subject—those of the Physiologists\r\nincluded—are too uncertain and fluctuating to permit them an absolute _à\r\npriori_ denial of such a fact.\r\n\r\nA careful perusal of the Commentaries would make one think that the Being\r\nwith which the new “Incarnate” bred, was called an “animal,” not because\r\nhe was no human being, but rather because he was so dissimilar physically\r\nand mentally to the more perfect races, which had developed\r\nphysiologically at an earlier period. Remember Stanza VII and what is said\r\nin Shloka 24, viz., that when the “Sons of Wisdom” came to incarnate the\r\nfirst time, some of them incarnated fully, others projected into the forms\r\nonly a Spark, while some of the Shadows were left over from the _filling_\r\nand perfecting, till the Fourth Race. Those races, then, which “remained\r\ndestitute of knowledge,” or those again which were left “mindless,”\r\nremained as they were, even after the natural separation of the sexes. It\r\nis these who committed the first cross‐breeding, so to speak, and bred\r\nmonsters; and it is from the descendants of these that the Atlanteans\r\nchose their wives. Adam and Eve, with Cain and Abel, were supposed to be\r\nthe only _human_ family on Earth. Yet we see Cain going to the land of Nod\r\nand taking there a wife. Evidently one race only was supposed perfect\r\nenough to be called human; and, even in our own day, while the Sinhalese\r\nregard the Veddhas of their jungles as _speaking animals_ and no more,\r\nsome British people, in their arrogance, firmly believe that every other\r\nhuman family—especially the dark Indians—is an _inferior_ race. Moreover\r\nthere are Naturalists who have seriously considered the problem whether\r\nsome savage tribes—like the Bushmen, for instance—can be regarded as _men_\r\nat all. The Commentary says, in describing that species (or race) of\r\nanimals “fair to look upon,” as a biped:\r\n\r\n_Having human shape, but having the lower extremities, from the waist\r\ndown, covered with hair._\r\n\r\nHence the race of the satyrs, perhaps.\r\n\r\nIf men existed two million years ago, they must have been—just as were the\r\nanimals—quite different physically and anatomically from what they have\r\nnow become, and nearer then to the type of pure mammalian animal than they\r\nare now. Anyhow, we learn that the animal world has bred strictly _inter\r\nse_—_i.e._, in accordance with genus and species—only since the appearance\r\n_on this Earth_ of the Atlantean Race. As demonstrated by the author of\r\nthat able work, _Modern Science and Modern Thought_, this idea of the\r\nrefusal to breed with another species, or that sterility is the only\r\nresult of such breeding, “appears to be a _primâ facie_ deduction rather\r\nthan an absolute law” even now. He shows that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Different species do, in fact, often breed together, as is seen in\r\n    the familiar instance of the horse and ass. It is true that in\r\n    this case the mule is sterile.... But this rule is not universal,\r\n    and quite recently one new hybrid race, that of the leporine, or\r\n    hare‐rabbit, has been created which is perfectly fertile.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe progeny of wolf and dog is also instanced, as also that of several\r\nother domestic animals; foxes and dogs again, and the modern Swiss cattle\r\nshown by Rütimeyer as descended from “three distinct species of fossil‐\r\noxen, the _Bos primigenius_, _Bos longifrons_ and _Bos frontosus_.”(652)\r\nYet some of those species, _as the ape family_, which so clearly resembles\r\nman in physical structure, contain, we are told,\r\n\r\n\r\n    Numerous branches, which graduate into one another, but the\r\n    extremes of which differ more widely than man does from the\r\n    highest of the ape series.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gorilla and chimpanzee, for instance.\r\n\r\nThus Mr. Darwin’s remark—or shall we say the remark of Linnæus?—_natura\r\nnon facit saltum_, is not only corroborated by Esoteric Science but\r\nwould—were there any chance of the real doctrine being accepted by any\r\nothers than its direct votaries—reconcile the modern evolution theory, in\r\nmore than one way, if not entirely, with facts, as also with the absolute\r\nfailure of the Anthropologists to meet with the “missing link” in our\r\nFourth Round geological formations.\r\n\r\nWe will show elsewhere that Modern Science, however unconsciously to\r\nitself, pleads our case by its own admissions, and that de Quatrefages is\r\nperfectly right, when he suggests in his last work, that it is far more\r\nlikely that the anthropoid ape should be discovered to be _the descendant\r\nof man_, than that these two types should have a common, fantastic and\r\nnowhere‐to‐be‐found ancestor. Thus the wisdom of the compilers of the old\r\nStanzas is vindicated by at least one eminent man of Science, and the\r\nOccultist prefers to believe, as he has ever done, that, as the Commentary\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n_Man was the first and highest [mammalian] animal that appeared in this\r\n[Fourth Round] creation. Then came still huger animals; and last of all\r\nthe dumb man who walks on all fours. [For] the Râkshasas [Giant‐Demons]\r\nand Daityas [Titans] of the White Dvipa [Continent] spoiled his [the dumb\r\nman’s] sires._\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as we see, there are Anthropologists who have traced man back\r\nto an epoch which goes far to break down the apparent barrier that exists\r\nbetween the chronologies of Modern Science and the Archaic Doctrine. It is\r\ntrue that English Scientists generally have declined to commit themselves\r\nto the sanction of the hypothesis of even a Tertiary man. They, each and\r\nall, measure the antiquity of Homo Primigenius by their own lights and\r\nprejudices. Huxley, indeed, ventures to speculate on a possible Pliocene\r\nor Miocene man. Prof. Seeman and Mr. Grant Allen have relegated his advent\r\nto the Eocene, but, speaking generally, English Scientists consider that\r\nwe cannot safely go beyond the Quaternary. Unfortunately, the facts do not\r\naccommodate the too cautious reserve of these latter. The French school of\r\nAnthropology, basing their views on the discoveries of l’Abbé Bourgeois,\r\nCapellini, and others, has accepted, almost without exception, the\r\ndoctrine that the traces of our ancestors are certainly to be found in the\r\nMiocene, while M. de Quatrefages now inclines to postulate a Secondary‐Age\r\nman. Further on we shall compare such estimates with the figures given in\r\nthe Brâhmanical exoteric books which approximate to the Esoteric Teaching.\r\n\r\n(_d_) “Then the Third Eye acted no longer,” says the Shloka, because Man\r\nhad sunk too deep into the mire of Matter.\r\n\r\nWhat is the meaning of this strange and weird statement in Shloka 42,\r\nconcerning the Third Eye of the Third Race which had died and acted no\r\nlonger?\r\n\r\nA few more Occult Teachings must now be given with reference to this point\r\nas well as some others. The history of the Third and Fourth Races must be\r\namplified, in order that it may throw some more light on the development\r\nof our present humanity; and show how the faculties, called into activity\r\nby Occult training, restore man to the position he previously occupied in\r\nreference to spiritual perception and consciousness. But the phenomenon of\r\nthe Third Eye has to be first explained.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Races With The “Third Eye.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject is so unusual, the paths pursued so intricate, so full of\r\ndangerous pitfalls prepared by adverse theories and criticism, that good\r\nreasons have to be given for every step taken. While turning the light of\r\nthe bull’s‐eye, called Esotericism, on almost every inch of the Occult\r\nground travelled over, we have also to use its lens to throw into stronger\r\nobjectivity the regions explored by exact Science; this, not only in order\r\nto contrast the two, but to defend our position.(653)\r\n\r\nIt may be complained by some that too little is said of the physical,\r\n_human_ side of the extinct races, in the history of their growth and\r\nevolution. Much more might be said, assuredly, if simple prudence did not\r\nmake us hesitate at the threshold of every new revelation. All that finds\r\npossibility and landmarks in the discoveries of Modern Science, is given;\r\nall that of which exact knowledge knows nothing and upon which it is\r\nunable to speculate—and therefore denies as fact in nature—is withheld.\r\n\r\nBut even such statements as, for instance, that, of all the mammalians,\r\nman was the earliest, that it is man who is the indirect ancestor of the\r\nape, and that he was a kind of Cyclops in days of old—all will be\r\ncontested; yet Scientists will never be able to prove, except to their own\r\nsatisfaction, that _it was not so_. Nor can they admit that the first two\r\nRaces of men were too ethereal and phantom‐like in their constitution,\r\norganism, and _shape_ even, to be called physical men. For, if they do, it\r\nwill be found that this is one of the reasons why their relics can never\r\nbe expected to be exhumed among other fossils. Nevertheless all this is\r\nmaintained. Man was the Store‐house, so to speak, of _all the seeds of\r\nlife_ for this Round, vegetable and animal alike.(654) As Ain Suph is\r\n“One, _notwithstanding the innumerable forms which are in him_,”(655) so\r\nis man, on Earth the microcosm of the macrocosm.\r\n\r\n\r\n    As soon as man appeared, everything was complete ... for\r\n    everything is comprised in man. He _unites in himself all\r\n    forms_.(656)\r\n\r\n    The mystery of the _earthly_ man is after the mystery of the\r\n    Heavenly Man.(657)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe human form—so called because it is the vehicle (under whatever shape)\r\nof the _Divine_ Man—is, as so intuitionally remarked by the author of\r\n“Esoteric Studies,” the _new type_, at the beginning of every Round.\r\n\r\n\r\n    As man never can be, so he never has been, manifested in a shape\r\n    belonging to the animal kingdom _in esse_, _i.e._, he never formed\r\n    part of that kingdom. Derived, only derived, from the most\r\n    finished class of the latter, a new human form must always have\r\n    been _the_ new type of the cycle. The human shape in one ring [?],\r\n    as I imagine, becomes cast‐off clothes in the next; it is then\r\n    appropriated by the highest order in the servant‐kingdom\r\n    below.(658)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the idea is what we understand it to mean—for the “rings” spoken of\r\nsomewhat confuse the matter—then it is the correct Esoteric Teaching.\r\nHaving appeared at the very beginning, and at the head of sentient and\r\nconscious life, Man—the Astral, or the “Soul,” for the _Zohar_, repeating\r\nthe Archaic Teaching, distinctly says that “the _real_ man is the soul,\r\nand his material frame no part of him”—Man became the living and animal\r\n_Unit_, from which the “cast‐off clothes” determined the shape of every\r\nlife and animal in this Round.(659)\r\n\r\nThus, he “created,” for ages, the insects, reptiles, birds, and animals,\r\nunconsciously to himself, from his remains and relics from the Third and\r\nthe Fourth Rounds. The same idea and teaching are as distinctly given in\r\nthe _Vendîdâd_ of the Mazdeans, as they are in the Chaldæan and Mosaic\r\nallegory of the Ark, all of which are the many national versions of the\r\noriginal legend given in the Hindû Scriptures. It is found in the allegory\r\nof Vaivasvata Manu and _his_ Ark with the Seven Rishis, each of whom is\r\nshown the Father and Progenitor of specified animals, reptiles, and even\r\nmonsters, as in the _Vishnu_ and other _Purânas_. Open the Mazdean\r\n_Vendîdâd_, and read the command of Ahura Mazda to Yima, a Spirit of the\r\nEarth, who symbolizes the three Races, after telling him to build a\r\nVara—“an enclosure,” an Argha or Vehicle.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Thither [into the Vara] thou shalt bring _the seeds of men and\r\n    women_, of the greatest, best, and finest kinds on this earth;\r\n    thither thou shalt bring the seeds of every kind of cattle,\r\n    etc.... All those seeds shalt thou bring, two of every kind _to be\r\n    kept inexhaustible there_, so long _as those men shall stay in the\r\n    Vara_.(660)\r\n\r\n\r\nThose “men” in the “Vara” are the “Progenitors,” the Heavenly Men or\r\nDhyânîs, the future Egos who are commissioned to inform mankind. For the\r\nVara, or Ark, or again the Vehicle, simply means _Man_.(661)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Thou shalt seal up the Vara [after filling it up with the seeds],\r\n    and thou shalt make a door, and a window _self‐shining within_\r\n    [which is the Soul].(662)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd when Yima enquires of Ahura Mazda how he shall manage to make that\r\nVara, he is answered:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Crush the earth ... and knead it with thy hands, as the potter\r\n    does when kneading the potter’s clay.(663)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian ram‐headed God makes man of clay on a potter’s wheel, and so\r\nin _Genesis_ do the Elohim fashion him out of the same material.\r\n\r\nWhen the “Maker of the material world,” Ahura Mazda, is asked,\r\nfurthermore, what is to give light “to the Vara which Yima made,” he\r\nanswers that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    There are _uncreated_ lights and _created_ lights. There [in\r\n    Airyana Vaêjô, where Vara is built], the stars, the moon, and the\r\n    sun are only once (a year) seen to rise and set, and a year seems\r\n    only as a day [and night].(664)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a clear reference to the “Land of the Gods” or the (now) Polar\r\nRegions. Moreover another hint is contained in this verse, a distinct\r\nallusion to the “uncreated lights” which enlighten man within—his\r\n“principles.” Otherwise, no sense or reason could be found in Ahura\r\nMazda’s answer which is forthwith followed by the words:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Every fortieth year, to every couple [hermaphrodite] _two are\r\n    born, a male and female_.(665)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe latter is a distinct echo of the Secret Doctrine, of a Stanza which\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n_At the expiration of every forty [annual] Suns, at the end of every\r\nfortieth Day, the double one becomes four; male and female in one, in the\r\nfirst and second and the third...._\r\n\r\nThis is clear, since every “Sun” meant a whole year, the latter being\r\ncomposed of one Day then, as in the Arctic Circle it is now composed of\r\nsix months. According to the old teaching, the axis of the Earth gradually\r\nchanges its inclination to the ecliptic, and at the period referred to,\r\nthis inclination was such that a polar Day lasted during the whole period\r\nof the Earth’s revolution about the Sun, when a kind of twilight of very\r\nshort duration intervened; after which the polar land resumed its position\r\ndirectly under the solar rays. This may be contrary to Astronomy as now\r\ntaught and understood; but who can say that changes in the motion of the\r\nEarth, which do not take place now, did not occur millions of years back?\r\n\r\nReturning once more to the statement that Vara meant the Man of the Fourth\r\nRound, as much as the Earth of those days, the Moon, and even Noah’s Ark,\r\nif one will so have it—this is again shown in the dialogue between Ahura\r\nMazda and Zarathushtra. Thus when the latter asks:\r\n\r\n\r\n    O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Who is he who\r\n    brought the law of Mazda into the Vara which Yima made?\r\n\r\n    Ahura Mazda answered: “It was the bird Karshipta, O holy\r\n    Zarathushtra!”(666)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the note explains:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The bird Karshipta dwells in the heavens: were he living on the\r\n    earth, he would be king of birds. He brought the law into the Var\r\n    of Yima, and recites the Avesta _in the language of birds_.(667)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis again is an allegory and a symbol misunderstood by the Orientalists\r\nonly, who see in this bird “an incarnation of lightning,” and say its song\r\nwas “often thought to be the utterance of a god and a revelation,” and\r\nwhat not. Karshipta is the human Mind‐Soul, and the deity thereof,\r\nsymbolized in ancient Magianism by a bird, as the Greeks symbolized it by\r\na butterfly. No sooner had Karshipta entered the Vara or Man, than he\r\nunderstood the law of Mazda, or Divine Wisdom. In the “Book of Concealed\r\nMystery” it is said of the Tree, which is the Tree of knowledge of good\r\nand evil:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In its branches the birds lodge and build their nests (the _souls_\r\n    and the angels have their place).(668)\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, with the Kabalists it was a like symbol. “Bird” was a Chaldæan,\r\nand has become a Hebrew, synonym and symbol for Angel, a Soul, a Spirit,\r\nor Deva; and the “Bird’s Nest” was, with both, Heaven, and is God’s Bosom,\r\nin the _Zohar_. The perfect Messiah enters Eden “into that place which is\r\ncalled the Bird’s Nest.”(669)\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Like a bird that is flying from its nest,” and that is the Soul\r\n    from which the She’kheen‐ah [divine wisdom or grace] does not move\r\n    away.(670)\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Nest of the Eternal Bird, the flutter of whose wings produces Life,\r\nis boundless Space_,\r\n\r\n—says the Commentary, meaning Hamsa, the Bird of Wisdom.\r\n\r\nIt is Adam Kadmon who is the tree of the Sephiroth, and it is he who\r\nbecomes the “tree of knowledge of good and evil,” Esoterically. And that\r\n“tree hath around it seven columns [seven pillars] of the world, or\r\nRectores [the same Progenitors or Sephiroth again], operating through the\r\nrespective orders of Angels in the spheres of the seven planets,” etc.,\r\none of which orders begets Giants (Nephilim) on Earth.\r\n\r\nIt was the belief of all antiquity, Pagan and Christian, that the earliest\r\nmankind was a race of giants. Certain excavations in America in mounds and\r\nin caves, have already, in isolated cases, yielded groups of skeletons of\r\nnine and twelve feet high.(671) These belong to tribes of the early Fifth\r\nRace, now degenerated to an average size of between five and six feet. But\r\nwe can easily believe that the Titans and Cyclopes of old really belonged\r\nto the Fourth (Atlantean) Race, and that all the subsequent legends and\r\nallegories found in the Hindû _Purânas_ and the Greek poems of Hesiod and\r\nHomer, were based on the hazy reminiscences of real Titans—men of a\r\ntremendous super‐human physical power, which enabled them to defend\r\nthemselves, and hold at bay the gigantic monsters of the Mesozoic and\r\nearly Cenozoic times—and of actual Cyclopes, “three‐eyed” mortals.\r\n\r\nIt has been often remarked by observant writers, that the “origin of\r\nnearly every popular myth and legend could be traced invariably to a fact\r\nin Nature.”\r\n\r\nIn these fantastic creations of an exuberant subjectivism, there is always\r\nan element of the objective and real. The imagination of the masses,\r\ndisorderly and ill‐regulated as it may be, could never have conceived and\r\nfabricated _ex nihilo_ so many monstrous figures, such a wealth of\r\nextraordinary tales, had it not had, to serve it as a central nucleus,\r\nthose floating reminiscences, obscure and vague, which unite the broken\r\nlinks of the chain of time to form with them the mysterious, dream\r\nfoundation of our collective consciousness.(672)\r\n\r\nThe evidence for the Cyclopes—a race of Giants—will, in forthcoming\r\nSections, be pointed out in the Cyclopean remnants, which are so called to\r\nthis day. An indication that the early Fourth Race—during its evolution\r\nand before the final adjustment of the human organism, which became\r\nperfect and symmetrical only in the Fifth Race—may have been three‐eyed,\r\nwithout having necessarily a third eye in the middle of the brow, like the\r\nlegendary Cyclops, is also furnished by Science.\r\n\r\nTo Occultists who believe that spiritual and psychic _involution_ proceeds\r\non parallel lines with physical _evolution_—that the _inner_ senses,\r\ninnate in the first human races, atrophied during racial growth and the\r\nmaterial development of the outer senses—to the students of Esoteric\r\nsymbology the above statement is no conjecture or possibility, but simply\r\n_a phase of the law of growth_, a proven fact, in short. They understand\r\nthe meaning of the passage in the Commentaries which says:\r\n\r\n_There were four‐armed human creatures in those early days of the male‐\r\nfemales [hermaphrodites]; with one head, yet three eyes. They could see\r\nbefore them and behind them._(_673_)_ A Kalpa later [after the separation\r\nof the sexes] men having fallen into matter, their spiritual vision became\r\ndim; and coördinately the Third Eye commenced to lose its power.... When\r\nthe Fourth [Race] arrived at its middle age, the Inner Vision had to be\r\nawakened, and acquired by artificial stimuli, the process of which was\r\nknown to the old Sages._(_674_)_... The Third Eye, likewise, getting\r\ngradually petrified,_(_675_)_ soon disappeared. The double‐faced became\r\nthe one‐faced, and the eye was drawn deep into the head and is now buried\r\nunder the hair. During the activity of the Inner Man [during trances and\r\nspiritual visions] the eye swells and expands. The Arhat sees and feels\r\nit, and regulates his action accordingly.... The undefiled Lanoo\r\n[Disciple, Chelâ] need fear no danger; he who keeps himself not in purity\r\n[who is not chaste] will receive no help from the __“__Deva Eye.__”_\r\n\r\nUnfortunately not. The “Deva Eye” exists no more for the majority of\r\nmankind. The Third Eye _is dead_, and acts no longer; but it has left\r\nbehind a witness to its existence. This witness is now the Pineal Gland.\r\nAs for the “four‐armed” men, it is they who became the prototypes of the\r\nfour‐armed Hindû Gods, as shown in a preceding footnote.\r\n\r\nSuch is the mystery of the _human eye_ that some Scientists have been\r\nforced to resort to Occult explanations in their vain endeavours to\r\nexplain and account for all the difficulties surrounding its action. The\r\ndevelopment of the human eye gives more support to Occult Anthropology\r\nthan to that of the Materialistic Physiologists. “The eyes in the human\r\nembryo grow _from within without_”—out of the brain, instead of being part\r\nof the skin, as in the insects and cuttlefish. Professor\r\nLankester—thinking the brain a queer place for the eye, and attempting to\r\nexplain the phenomenon on Darwinian lines—suggests the curious view that\r\n“our” earliest vertebrate ancestor was a “_transparent_” creature and\r\nhence did not mind where the eye was! And so was man a “transparent\r\ncreature” once upon a time, we are taught; and hence our theory holds\r\ngood. But how does the Lankester hypothesis square with the Hæckelian view\r\nthat the vertebrate eye originated by changes _in the epidermis_? If it\r\nstarted _inside_, the latter theory goes into the waste basket. This seems\r\nto be proved by embryology. Moreover, Professor Lankester’s extraordinary\r\nsuggestion—or shall we say admission?—is perhaps rendered necessary by\r\nevolutionist necessities. Occultism, with its teaching as to the gradual\r\ndevelopment of senses “_from within without_,” from astral prototypes, is\r\nfar more satisfactory. The Third Eye _retreated inwards_ when its course\r\nwas run—another point in favour of Occultism.\r\n\r\nThe allegorical expression of the Hindû mystics who speak of the “Eye of\r\nShiva,” the Tri‐lochana, or “three‐eyed,” thus receives its justification\r\nand _raison d’être_: the transference of the Pineal Gland (once that Third\r\nEye) to the forehead, being an exoteric licence. This throws also a light\r\non the mystery—incomprehensible to some—of the connection between\r\n_abnormal_, or spiritual Seership, and the physiological purity of the\r\nSeer. The question is often asked: Why should celibacy and chastity be a\r\n_sine quâ non_ condition of regular Chelâship, or the development of\r\npsychic and occult powers? The answer is contained in the Commentary. When\r\nwe learn that the Third Eye was once a physiological organ, and that later\r\non, owing to the gradual disappearance of spirituality and increase of\r\nmateriality, the spiritual nature being extinguished by the physical, it\r\nbecame an atrophied organ, as little understood now by Physiologists as is\r\nthe spleen—when we learn this, the connection becomes clear. During human\r\nlife the greatest impediment in the way of spiritual development, and\r\nespecially to the acquirement of Yoga powers, is the activity of our\r\nphysiological senses. Sexual action also being closely connected, by\r\ninteraction, with the spinal cord and the grey matter of the brain, it is\r\nuseless to give any longer explanation. Of course, the normal and abnormal\r\nstate of the brain, and the degree of active work in the Medulla\r\nOblongata, reacts powerfully on the Pineal Gland, for, owing to the number\r\nof “centres” in that region, which controls by far the greatest number of\r\nthe physiological actions of the animal economy, and also owing to the\r\nclose and intimate neighbourhood of the two, a very powerful “inductive”\r\naction must be exerted by the Medulla on the Pineal Gland.\r\n\r\nAll this is quite plain to the Occultist, but is very vague in the sight\r\nof the general reader. The latter must then be shown the possibility of a\r\nthree‐eyed man in Nature, in those periods when his formation was yet in a\r\ncomparatively chaotic state. Such a possibility may be inferred from\r\nanatomical and zoological knowledge, first of all, and then it may rest on\r\nthe assumptions of Materialistic Science itself.\r\n\r\nIt is asserted upon the authority of Science, and upon evidence, which is\r\nthis time not merely a fiction of theoretical speculation, that many of\r\nthe animals—especially among the lower orders of the vertebrata—have a\r\n_third_ eye, now atrophied, but which was necessarily active in its\r\norigin.(676) The Hatteria species, a lizard of the order Lacertilia,\r\nrecently discovered in New Zealand—_a part of ancient Lemuria so called,\r\nmark well_—presents this peculiarity in a most extraordinary manner; and\r\nnot only the Hatteria Punctata, but the Chameleon, and certain reptiles,\r\nand even fishes. It was thought, at first, that this was no more than the\r\nprolongation of the brain which ended with a small protuberance, called\r\nEpiphysis, a little bone separated from the main bone by a cartilage, and\r\nfound in every animal. But it was soon found to be more than this. As its\r\ndevelopment and anatomical structure showed, it offered such an analogy\r\nwith that of the eye, that it was found impossible to see in it anything\r\nelse. There are Palæontologists who to this day feel convinced that this\r\nThird Eye originally functioned, and they are certainly right. For this is\r\nwhat is said of the Pineal Gland in Quain’s _Anatomy_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is from this part, constituting at first the whole and\r\n    subsequently the hinder part of the anterior primary encephalic\r\n    vesicle, that the optic vesicles are developed in the earliest\r\n    period, and the fore part is that in connection with which the\r\n    cerebral hemispheres and accompanying parts are formed. The\r\n    thalamus opticus of each side is formed by a lateral thickening of\r\n    the medullary wall, while the interval between, descending towards\r\n    the base, constitutes the cavity of the third ventricle with its\r\n    prolongation in the infundibulum. The grey commissure afterwards\r\n    stretches across the ventricular cavity.... The hinder part of the\r\n    roof is developed by a peculiar process to be noticed later into\r\n    the pineal gland, which remains united on each side by its\r\n    pedicles to the thalamus, and behind these a transverse band is\r\n    formed as posterior commissure.\r\n\r\n    The lamina terminalis (lamina cinerea) continues to close the\r\n    third ventricle in front, below it the optic commissure forms the\r\n    floor of the ventricle, and further back the infundibulum descends\r\n    to be united in the sella turcica with the tissue adjoining the\r\n    posterior lobe of the pituitary body.\r\n\r\n    The two _optic thalami_, formed from the posterior and outer part\r\n    of the anterior vesicle, consist at first of a single hollow sac\r\n    of nervous matter, the cavity of which communicates on each side\r\n    in front with that of the commencing cerebral hemispheres, and\r\n    behind with that of the middle cephalic vesicle (corpora\r\n    quadrigemina). Soon, however, by increased deposit taking place in\r\n    their interior behind, below, and at the sides, the thalami become\r\n    solid, and at the same time a cleft or fissure appears between\r\n    them above, and penetrates down to the internal cavity, which\r\n    continues open at the back part opposite the entrance of the\r\n    Sylvian aqueduct. This cleft or fissure is the _third ventricle_.\r\n    Behind, the two thalami continue united by the _posterior\r\n    commissure_, which is distinguishable about the end of the third\r\n    month, and also by the _peduncles of the pineal gland_....\r\n\r\n    At an early period the _optic tracts_ may be recognized as hollow\r\n    prolongations from the outer part of the wall of the thalami while\r\n    they are still vesicular. At the fourth month these tracts are\r\n    distinctly formed. They subsequently are prolonged backwards into\r\n    connection with the corpora quadrigemina.\r\n\r\n    The formation of the pineal gland and pituitary body presents some\r\n    of the most interesting phenomena which are connected with the\r\n    development of the thalamencephalon.(677)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above is specially interesting when it is remembered that, were it not\r\nfor the development of the posterior part of the cerebral hemispheres, the\r\nPineal Gland would be perfectly visible on the removal of the parietal\r\nbones. It is very interesting also to note the obvious connection which\r\ncan be traced between the originally hollow Optic Tract and the Eyes\r\nanteriorly, and the Pineal Gland and its Peduncles posteriorly, and\r\nbetween all of these and the Optic Thalami. So that the recent discoveries\r\nin connection with the third eye of Hatteria Punctata have a very\r\nimportant bearing on the history of the development of the human senses,\r\nand on the Occult assertions in the text.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that Descartes saw in the Pineal Gland the _Seat of the\r\nSoul_, though this is now regarded as a fiction by those who have ceased\r\nto believe in the existence of an immortal principle in man. Although the\r\nSoul is joined to every part of the body, he said, there is one special\r\nportion of the latter in which the Soul exercises its functions more\r\nspecially than in any other. And, as neither the heart, nor yet the brain\r\ncould be that “special” locality, he concluded that it was that little\r\ngland which was tied to the brain, and yet had an action independent of\r\nit, as it could easily be put into a kind of swinging motion “by the\r\n_animal spirits_(678) which cross the cavities of the skull in every\r\nsense.”\r\n\r\nUnscientific as this may appear in our day of exact learning, Descartes\r\nwas yet far nearer the Occult truth than is any Hæckel. For the Pineal\r\nGland is, as shown, far more closely connected with Soul and Spirit than\r\nwith the physiological senses of man. Had the leading Scientists a glimmer\r\nof the _real_ processes employed by the Evolutionary Impulse, and the\r\nwinding _cyclic_ course of this great Law, they would _know_ instead of\r\nconjecturing, and would feel certain of the future physical\r\ntransformations which await the human kind by the knowledge of its past\r\nforms. Then would they see the fallacy and the absurdity of their modern\r\n“blind‐force” and “mechanical” processes of Nature; and, in consequence of\r\nsuch knowledge, would realize that the said Pineal Gland, for instance,\r\ncould not but be disabled for _physical_ use at this stage of our Cycle.\r\nIf the odd “eye” is now atrophied in man, it is a proof that, as in the\r\nlower animal, it has once been active; for Nature never creates the\r\nsmallest, the most insignificant, form without some definite purpose and\r\nfor some use. It was an active organ, we say, at that stage of evolution\r\nwhen the spiritual element in man reigned supreme over the hardly nascent\r\nintellectual and psychic elements. And, as the Cycle ran down towards that\r\npoint where the physiological senses were developed by, and went _pari\r\npassu_ with, the growth and consolidation of physical man—the interminable\r\nand complex vicissitudes and tribulations of zoological development—this\r\nmedian “eye” at last atrophied together with the early spiritual and\r\npurely psychic characteristics in man. The eye is the mirror and also the\r\nwindow of the Soul, says popular wisdom,(679) and _Vox populi, vox Dei_.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, every class and family of the living species was\r\nhermaphrodite and objectively one‐eyed. In the animal—whose form was as\r\nethereal (astrally) as that of man, before the bodies of both began to\r\nevolve their “coats of skin,” viz., to evolve, from _within without_, the\r\nthick coating of physical substance or matter with its internal\r\nphysiological mechanism—the Third Eye was primarily, as in man, the only\r\nseeing organ. The two physical front eyes only developed(680) later on in\r\nboth brute and man, whose organ of physical sight was, at the commencement\r\nof the Third Race, in the same position as that of some of the blind\r\nvertebrates, in our day, _i.e._, beneath an opaque skin.(681) Only, the\r\nstages of the odd, or primeval, eye, in man and brute, are now inverted,\r\nas the former has already passed that animal non‐rational stage in the\r\nThird Round, and is ahead of mere brute creation by a whole plane of\r\nconsciousness. Therefore, while the Cyclopean eye was, and still _is_, in\r\nman the organ of _spiritual_ sight, in the animal it was that of objective\r\nvision. And this eye, having performed its function, was replaced, in the\r\ncourse of physical evolution from the simple to the complex, by two eyes,\r\nand thus was stored and laid aside by Nature for further use in æons to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nThis explains why the Pineal Gland reached its highest development\r\nproportionately with the lowest physical development. It is in the\r\nVertebrata that it is the most prominent and objective, whereas in man it\r\nis most carefully hidden and inaccessible, except to the Anatomist. No\r\nless light, however, is thereby thrown on the future physical, spiritual,\r\nand intellectual state of mankind, in periods corresponding on parallel\r\nlines with other past periods, and always on the lines of ascending and\r\ndescending cyclic evolution and development. Thus, a few centuries before\r\nthe Kali Yuga—the Age which began nearly 5,000 years ago—it was said in\r\nCommentary Twenty, if it is paraphrased into comprehensible sentences:\r\n\r\n_We [the Fifth Root‐Race] in our first half [of duration] onward [on the\r\nnow ascending arc of the Cycle] are on the mid point of [or between] the\r\nFirst and Second Races—falling downward [i.e., the Races were then on the\r\ndescending arc of the Cycle].... Calculate for thyself, Lanoo, and see._\r\n\r\nCalculating as advised, we find that during that transitional\r\nperiod—namely, in the second half of the First spiritual ethereo‐astral\r\nRace—nascent mankind was devoid of the intellectual brain element, as it\r\nwas on its _descending_ line. And as we are parallel to it, on the\r\n_ascending_, we are, therefore, devoid of the spiritual element, which is\r\nnow replaced by the intellectual. For, remember well, as we are in the\r\nMânasa period of our Cycle of Races, or in the Fifth, we have, therefore,\r\ncrossed the meridian point of the perfect adjustment of Spirit and\r\nMatter—or the equilibrium between brain intellect and spiritual\r\nperception. One important point, has, however, to be borne in mind.\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: Evolution of Root‐Races in the Fourth Round]\r\n\r\n[Transcriber’s Note: The graph shows, to the left, “Downward Cycle.\r\nEvolution of Physical and Intellectual Nature and the Gradual Regression\r\nof Spirituality.” To the right is “Ascending Cycle. Reëvolution or\r\nReversion of Spirituality and the Gradual Decrease of Materiality and mere\r\nBrain‐intellectuality.” Below is “Meridian of Races.”]\r\n\r\nWe are only in the Fourth Round, and it is in the Fifth that the full\r\ndevelopment of Manas, as a direct ray from the Universal Mahat—a ray\r\nunimpeded by Matter—will be finally reached. Nevertheless, as every sub‐\r\nrace and nation have their cycles and stages of evolutionary development\r\nrepeated on a smaller scale, much more must it be so in the case of a\r\nRoot‐Race. Our Race then has, as a Root‐Race, crossed the equatorial line\r\nand is cycling onward on the spiritual side; but some of our sub‐races\r\nstill find themselves on the shadowy descending arc of their respective\r\nnational cycles; while others again—the oldest—having crossed the crucial\r\npoint, which alone decides whether a race, a nation, or a tribe, will live\r\nor perish, are at the apex of spiritual development as sub‐races.\r\n\r\nIt now becomes comprehensible why the Third Eye was gradually transformed\r\ninto a simple gland, after the physical Fall of those we have agreed to\r\ncall the Lemurians.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that in human beings the cerebral hemispheres and the\r\nlateral ventricles have been especially developed, whereas it is the Optic\r\nThalami, Corpora Quadrigemina, and Corpora Striata which are the principal\r\nparts developed in other mammalian brains. Moreover, it is asserted that\r\nthe intellect of a man may, to some extent, be gauged by the development\r\nof the central convolutions and the fore part of the cerebral hemispheres.\r\nIt would seem a natural corollary to this that if the development of the\r\nPineal Gland may be considered to be an index of the astral capacities and\r\nspiritual proclivities of any man, there will be a corresponding\r\ndevelopment of that part of the cranium, or an increase in the size of the\r\nPineal Gland at the expense of the posterior part of the cerebral\r\nhemispheres. This is a curious speculation and would receive confirmation\r\nin the present case. We should see, below and behind, the cerebellum which\r\nhas been held to be the seat of all the animal proclivities of the human\r\nbeing, and which is allowed by Science to be the great centre for all the\r\nphysiologically coördinated movements of the body, such as walking,\r\neating, etc.; in front, the fore‐part of the brain, the cerebral\r\nhemispheres, the part especially connected with the development of the\r\nintellectual powers in man; and in the middle, dominating them both, and\r\nespecially the animal functions, the developed Pineal Gland, in connection\r\nwith the more highly evolved, or spiritual man.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that these are only physical correspondences; just\r\nas the ordinary human brain is the registering organ of memory, but not\r\nmemory itself.\r\n\r\nThis is, then, the organ which has given rise to so many legends and\r\ntraditions, among others to that of men with one head but two faces. These\r\nlegends may be found in several Chinese works, besides being referred to\r\nin the Chaldæan fragments. Apart from the work already cited, the _Shan\r\nHai King_, compiled by Kung Chia from engravings on nine urns made by the\r\nEmperor Yü, 2,255 B.C., they may be found in another work, called the\r\n_Bamboo Books_, and in a third, the _’Rh Ya_, whose author was “initiated\r\naccording to tradition by Chow Kung, uncle of Wu Wang, the first Emperor\r\nof the Chow Dynasty, 1,122 B.C.” The _Bamboo Books_ contain the ancient\r\nannals of China, found A.D. 279 on opening the grave of King Seang of Wei,\r\nwho died 295 B.C.(682) Both these works mention men with two faces on one\r\nhead—one in front and one behind.\r\n\r\nNow what students of Occultism ought to know is that the Third Eye _is\r\nindissolubly connected with Karma_. The tenet is so mysterious that very\r\nfew have heard of it.\r\n\r\nThe “Eye of Shiva” did not become entirety atrophied before the close of\r\nthe Fourth Race. When spirituality and all the divine powers and\r\nattributes of the Deva‐Man of the Third Race had been made the hand‐\r\nmaidens of the newly‐awakened physiological and psychic passions of the\r\nphysical man, instead of the reverse, the Eye lost its powers. But such\r\nwas the law of evolution, and it was, in strict accuracy, no _Fall_. The\r\nsin was not in using those newly‐developed powers, but in _misusing_ them;\r\nin making of the tabernacle, designed to contain a God, the fane of every\r\n_spiritual_ iniquity. And if we say “sin” it is merely that everyone\r\nshould understand our meaning, for Karma(683) would be the more correct\r\nterm to use in this case; moreover the reader who should feel perplexed at\r\nthe use of the term “spiritual” instead of “physical” iniquity, is\r\nreminded of the fact that there can be no physical iniquity. The body is\r\nsimply the irresponsible organ, the tool of the Psychic, if not of the\r\nSpiritual, Man. And in the case of the Atlanteans, it was precisely the\r\nSpiritual Being which sinned, the Spirit Element being still the “Master”\r\nPrinciple in man, in those days. Thus it is in those days that the\r\nheaviest Karma of the Fifth Race was generated by our Monads.\r\n\r\nAs this sentence may again be found puzzling, it is better that it should\r\nbe explained for the benefit of those who are ignorant of Theosophical\r\nTeachings.\r\n\r\nQuestions with regard to Karma and Re‐births are constantly being put\r\nforward, and great confusion seems to exist upon the subject. Those who\r\nare born and bred in the Christian faith, and have been trained in the\r\nidea that a new Soul is created by God for every newly‐born infant, are\r\namong the most perplexed. They ask whether the number of Monads\r\nincarnating on Earth is limited; to which they are answered in the\r\naffirmative. For, however countless, in our conception, the number of the\r\nincarnating Monads, still, there must be a limit. This is so even if we\r\ntake into account the fact that ever since the Second Race, when their\r\nrespective seven Groups were furnished with bodies, several births and\r\ndeaths may be allowed for every second of time in the æons already passed.\r\nIt has been stated that Karma‐Nemesis, whose bond‐maid is Nature, adjusted\r\neverything in the most harmonious manner; and that, therefore, the fresh\r\npouring‐in, or arrival of new Monads, ceased as soon as Humanity had\r\nreached its full physical development. No fresh Monads have incarnated\r\nsince the middle‐point of the Atlanteans. Let us remember that, save in\r\nthe case of young children, and of individuals whose lives have been\r\nviolently cut off by some accident, no Spiritual Entity can reïncarnate\r\nbefore a period of many centuries has elapsed, and such gaps alone must\r\nshow that the number of Monads is necessarily finite and limited.\r\nMoreover, a reasonable time must be given to other animals for their\r\nevolutionary progress.\r\n\r\nHence the assertion that many of us are now working off the effects of the\r\nevil Karmic causes produced by us in Atlantean bodies. The Law of Karma is\r\ninextricably interwoven with that of Reïncarnation.\r\n\r\nIt is only the knowledge of the constant re‐births of one and the same\r\nIndividuality throughout the Life‐Cycle; the assurance that the same\r\nMonads—among whom are many Dhyân Chohans, or the “Gods” themselves—have to\r\npass through the “Circle of Necessity,” rewarded or punished by such\r\nrebirth for the suffering endured or crimes committed in the former life;\r\nthat those very Monads, which entered the empty, senseless Shells, or\r\nAstral Figures of the First Race emanated by the Pitris, are the same who\r\nare now amongst us—nay, ourselves, perchance; it is only this doctrine, we\r\nsay, that can explain to us the mysterious problem of Good and Evil, and\r\nreconcile man to the terrible _apparent_ injustice of life. Nothing but\r\nsuch certainty can quiet our revolted sense of justice. For, when one\r\nunacquainted with the noble doctrine looks around him, and observes the\r\ninequalities of birth and fortune, of intellect and capacities; when one\r\nsees honour paid to fools and profligates, on whom fortune has heaped her\r\nfavours by mere privilege of birth, and their nearest neighbour, with all\r\nhis intellect and noble virtues—far more deserving in every way—perishing\r\nof want and for lack of sympathy; when one sees all this and has to turn\r\naway, helpless to relieve the undeserved suffering, one’s ears ringing and\r\nheart aching with the cries of pain around him—that blessed knowledge of\r\nKarma alone prevents him from cursing life and men, as well as their\r\nsupposed Creator.(684)\r\n\r\nOf all the terrible blasphemies and what are virtually accusations thrown\r\nat their God by the Monotheists, none is greater or more unpardonable than\r\nthat (almost always) false humility which makes the presumably “pious”\r\nChristian assert, in the face of every evil and undeserved blow, that\r\n“such _is the will_ of God.”\r\n\r\nDolts and hypocrites! Blasphemers and impious Pharisees who speak in the\r\nsame breath of the endless merciful love and care of their God and Creator\r\nfor helpless man, and of that God _scourging the good, the very best of\r\nhis creatures, bleeding them to death like an insatiable Moloch_! Shall we\r\nbe answered to this, in Congreve’s words:\r\n\r\n\r\n    But who shall dare to tax Eternal Justice?\r\n\r\n\r\nLogic and simple common sense, we answer. If we are asked to believe in\r\n“original sin,” in _one_ life _only_ on this Earth for every Soul, and in\r\nan anthropomorphic Deity, who seems to have created some men only for the\r\npleasure of condemning them to eternal hell‐fire—and this whether they be\r\ngood or bad, says the Predestinarian(685)—why should not everyone of us\r\nwho is endowed with reasoning powers, condemn in his turn such a\r\nvillainous Deity? Life would become unbearable, if one had to believe in\r\nthe God created by man’s unclean fancy. Luckily he exists only in human\r\ndogmas, and in the unhealthy imagination of some poets, who believe they\r\nhave solved the problem by addressing him as:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Thou great Mysterious Power, who hast _involved_\r\n    The pride of human wisdom, _to confound_\r\n    The _daring scrutiny_ and prove _the faith_\r\n    Of thy _presuming_ creatures!\r\n\r\n\r\nTruly a robust “faith” is required to believe that it is “presumption” to\r\nquestion the justice of one, who creates helpless little man but to\r\n“perplex” him, and to test a “faith” with which that “Power,” moreover,\r\nmay have forgotten, if not neglected, to endow him, as happens sometimes.\r\n\r\nCompare this blind faith with the philosophical belief, based on every\r\nreasonable evidence and on life‐experience, in Karma‐Nemesis, or the Law\r\nof Retribution. This Law—whether Conscious or Unconscious—predestines\r\nnothing and no one. It exists from and in Eternity, truly, for it is\r\nEternity itself; and as such, since no act can be coëqual with Eternity,\r\nit cannot be said to act, for it is Action itself. It is not the _wave_\r\nwhich drowns a man, but the _personal_ action of the wretch who goes\r\ndeliberately and places himself under the _impersonal_ action of the laws\r\nthat govern the _ocean’s_ motion. Karma creates nothing, nor does it\r\ndesign. It is man who plans and creates causes, and Karmic Law adjusts the\r\neffects, which adjustment is not an act, but universal harmony, tending\r\never to resume its original position, like a bough, which, bent down too\r\nforcibly, rebounds with corresponding vigour. If it happen to dislocate\r\nthe arm that tried to bend it out of its natural position, shall we say\r\nthat it is the bough which broke our arm, or that our own folly has\r\nbrought us to grief? Karma has never sought to destroy intellectual and\r\nindividual liberty, like the God invented by the Monotheists. It has not\r\ninvolved its decrees in darkness purposely to perplex man; nor shall it\r\npunish him who dares to scrutinize its mysteries. On the contrary, he who\r\nthrough study and meditation unveils its intricate paths, and throws light\r\non those dark ways, in the windings of which so many men perish owing to\r\ntheir ignorance of the labyrinth of life—is working for the good of his\r\nfellow‐men. Karma is an Absolute and Eternal Law in the World of\r\nManifestation; and as there can only be one Absolute, as One eternal ever‐\r\npresent Cause, believers in Karma cannot be regarded as Atheists or\r\nMaterialists—still less as Fatalists,(686) for Karma is one with the\r\nUnknowable, of which it is an aspect, in its effects in the phenomenal\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIntimately, or rather indissolubly, connected with Karma, then, is the Law\r\nof Re‐birth, or of the reïncarnation of the same spiritual Individuality\r\nin a long, almost interminable, series of Personalities. The latter are\r\nlike the various characters played by the same actor, with each of which\r\nthat actor identifies himself and is identified by the public, for the\r\nspace of a few hours. The _inner_, or real Man, who personates those\r\ncharacters, knows the whole time that he is Hamlet only for the brief\r\nspace of a few acts, which, however, on the plane of human illusion,\r\nrepresent the whole life of Hamlet. He knows also that he was, the night\r\nbefore, King Lear, the transformation in his turn of the Othello of a\r\nstill earlier preceding night. And though the outer, visible character is\r\nsupposed to be ignorant of the fact, and in actual life that ignorance is,\r\nunfortunately, but too real, nevertheless, the _permanent_ Individuality\r\nis fully aware of it, and it is through the atrophy of the “spiritual” Eye\r\nin the physical body, that that knowledge is unable to impress itself on\r\nthe consciousness of the false Personality.\r\n\r\nThe possession of a physical Third Eye, we are told, was enjoyed by the\r\nmen of the Third Root‐Race down to nearly the middle period of the third\r\nsub‐race of the Fourth Root‐Race, when the consolidation and perfection of\r\nthe human frame caused it to disappear from the outward anatomy of man.\r\nPsychically and spiritually, however, its mental and visual perception\r\nlasted till nearly the end of the Fourth Race, when its functions, owing\r\nto the materiality and depraved condition of mankind, died out altogether.\r\nThis was prior to the submersion of the bulk of the Atlantean Continent.\r\nAnd now we may return to the Deluges and their many “Noahs.”\r\n\r\nThe student has to bear in mind that there were many such Deluges as that\r\nmentioned in _Genesis_, and three far more important ones, which will be\r\nmentioned and described in the Section of Part III devoted to the subject\r\nof pre‐historic “Submerged Continents.” To avoid erroneous conjectures,\r\nhowever, with regard to the claim that the Esoteric Doctrine has much in\r\ncommon with the legends contained in the Hindû Scriptures; that, again,\r\nthe chronology of the latter is almost that of the former—only explained\r\nand made clear; and that finally the belief that Vaivasvata Manu—a generic\r\nterm indeed!—was the Noah of the Âryans and the prototype of the biblical\r\npatriarch, all this—as pertaining also to the belief of the\r\nOccultists—necessitates a new explanation at this juncture.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Primeval Manus Of Humanity.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who are aware that the “Great Flood,” which was connected with the\r\nsinking of an entire Continent (save only a few islands) could not have\r\nhappened so far back as 18,000,000 years ago, and that Vaivasvata Manu is\r\nthe Indian Noah connected with the Matsya, or the Fish, Avatâra of Vishnu,\r\nmay feel perplexed at the apparent discrepancy between the facts stated\r\nand the chronology previously given. But there is no discrepancy in truth.\r\nThe reader is asked to turn to _The Theosophist_ of July, 1883, for by\r\nstudying the article therein, on “The Septenary Principle in Esotericism,”\r\nthe whole question can be explained to him. It is in the explanation there\r\ngiven, I believe, that the Occultists differ from the Brâhmans.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of those, however, who may not have _The Theosophist_ of\r\nthat date to hand, a passage or two may now be quoted from it:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Who was Manu, the son of Svâyambhuva? The Secret Doctrine tells us\r\n    that _this_ Manu was no man, but the representation of the first\r\n    human races, evolved with the help of the Dhyân Chohans (Devas),\r\n    at the beginning of the First Round. But we are told in his _Laws_\r\n    (i. 80) that there are fourteen Manus for every Kalpa, or\r\n    “interval from creation to creation”—read rather interval from one\r\n    _minor_ Pralaya to another(687)—and that “in the present divine\r\n    age, there have been as yet _seven_ Manus.” Those who know that\r\n    there are seven Rounds, of which we have passed three, and are now\r\n    in the Fourth; and who are taught that there are seven Dawns and\r\n    seven Twilights, or fourteen Manvantaras; that at the beginning of\r\n    every Round and at the end, and on, and between, the planets\r\n    [Globes] there is an “awakening to _illusive_ life,” and an\r\n    “awakening to _real_ life”; and that, moreover, there are Root‐\r\n    Manus, and what we have to clumsily translate as Seed‐Manus—_the\r\n    seeds for the human races of the forthcoming_ Round (or the\r\n    Shishtas—the surviving fittest(688); a mystery divulged only to\r\n    those who have passed their third degree in Initiation)—those who\r\n    have learned all this will be better prepared to understand the\r\n    meaning of the following. We are told in the Hindû Sacred\r\n    Scriptures that, “The first Manu produced _six_ other Manus\r\n    [_seven_ primary Manus in all], and these produced in their turn\r\n    each seven other Manus”(689) (_Bhrigu_, i. 61‐63)—the production\r\n    of the latter standing in the Occult treatises as 7 x 7. Thus it\r\n    becomes clear that Manu—the last one, the Progenitor of our\r\n    Fourth‐Round Humanity—must be the _seventh_, since we are on our\r\n    Fourth Round,(690) and there is a _Root_‐Manu at Globe A, and a\r\n    _Seed_‐Manu at Globe G. Just as each planetary Round commences\r\n    with the appearance of a Root‐Manu (Dhyân Chohan) and closes with\r\n    a Seed‐Manu, so a Root‐ and a Seed‐Manu appear respectively at the\r\n    beginning and the termination of the human period on any\r\n    particular planet [Globe].(691) It will be easily seen from the\r\n    foregoing statement that a Manvantaric period (Manu‐antara) means,\r\n    as the term implies, the time _between_ the appearance of two\r\n    Manus or Dhyân Chohans; and hence a Minor Manvantara is the\r\n    duration of the _seven_ Races on any particular planet [Globe],\r\n    and a Major Manvantara is the period of one human Round along the\r\n    Planetary Chain. Moreover, as it is said that each of the seven\r\n    Manus _creates_ 7 x 7 Manus, and that there are 49 Root‐Races on\r\n    the seven planets [Globes] during each Round, then every Root‐Race\r\n    has its Manu. The present seventh Manu is called “Vaivasvata” and\r\n    stands in the exoteric texts for that Manu who in India represents\r\n    the Babylonian Xisuthrus and the Jewish Noah.\r\n\r\n    But in the Esoteric books we are told that Manu Vaivasvata, the\r\n    progenitor of our _Fifth_ Race—who saved it from the flood that\r\n    nearly exterminated the Fourth or Atlantean—is not the seventh\r\n    Manu, mentioned in the nomenclature of the Root or Primitive\r\n    Manus, but one of the 49 Manus emanated from this Root‐Manu.\r\n\r\n    For clearer comprehension we here give the names of the 14 Manus\r\n    in their respective order and in their relation to each Round:\r\n\r\n    1st Round, 1st (Root) Manu on Planet A—Svâyambhuva.\r\n    1st Round, 1st (Seed) Manu on Planet G—Svârochi, or Svârochisha.\r\n    2nd Round, 2nd (Root) Manu on Planet A—Auttami.\r\n    2nd Round, 2nd (Seed) Manu on Planet G—Tâmasa.\r\n    3rd Round, 3rd (Root) Manu on Planet A—Raivata.\r\n    3rd Round, 3rd (Seed) Manu on Planet G—Châkshusha.\r\n    4th Round, 4th (Root) Manu on Planet A—Vaivasvata (our\r\n                Progenitor).\r\n    4th Round, 4th (Seed) Manu on Planet G—Sâvarna.\r\n    5th Round, 5th (Root) Manu on Planet A—Daksha‐sâvarna.\r\n    5th Round, 5th (Seed) Manu on Planet G—Brahma‐sâvarna.\r\n    6th Round, 6th (Root) Manu on Planet A—Dharma‐sâvarna.\r\n    6th Round, 6th (Seed) Manu on Planet G—Rudra‐sâvarna.\r\n    7th Round, 7th (Root) Manu on Planet A—Rauchya.\r\n    7th Round, 7th (Seed) Manu on Planet G—Bhautya.\r\n\r\n    Vaivasvata, thus, though seventh in the order given, is the\r\n    primitive Root‐Manu of our Fourth Human Wave (the reader must\r\n    always remember that Manu is not a man but collective humanity),\r\n    while _our_ Vaivasvata was but one of the seven Minor Manus, who\r\n    are made to preside over the seven Races of this our planet\r\n    [Globe]. Each of these has to become the witness of one of the\r\n    periodical and ever‐recurring cataclysms (by fire and water) that\r\n    close the cycle of every Root‐Race. And it is this Vaivasvata—the\r\n    Hindû ideal embodiment, called respectively Xisuthrus, Deucalion,\r\n    Noah and other names—who is the allegorical “Man” who rescued our\r\n    Race, when nearly the whole population of one hemisphere perished\r\n    by water, while the other hemisphere was awakening from its\r\n    temporary obscuration.(692)\r\n\r\n\r\nThus it is shown that there is no real discrepancy in speaking of the\r\nVaivasvata Manvantara (Manu‐antara, lit., “between two Manus”) as\r\n18,000,000 odd years ago, when physical, or the truly human, Man first\r\nappeared in his Fourth Round on this Earth; and of the other Vaivasvatas,\r\n_e.g._, the Manu of the Great Cosmic or Sidereal Flood—a mystery—or again\r\nthe Manu Vaivasvata of the submerged Atlantis, when the _Racial_\r\nVaivasvata saved the elect of Humanity, the Fifth Race, from utter\r\ndestruction. As these several and quite distinct events are purposely\r\nblended in the _Vishnu_ and other _Purânas_ in one narrative, there may\r\nyet be a great deal of perplexity left in the profane reader’s mind.\r\nTherefore, as constant elucidation is needed, we must be forgiven\r\nunavoidable repetitions. The “blinds” which conceal the real mysteries of\r\nEsoteric Philosophy are great and puzzling, and even now the last word\r\ncannot be given. The veil, however, may be a little more removed, and some\r\nexplanations, hitherto denied, may now be offered to the earnest student.\r\n\r\nAs Colonel Vans Kennedy, if we do not mistake, remarked: “the first\r\nprinciple in Hindû religious philosophy is _unity in diversity_.” If all\r\nthose Manus and Rishis are called by one generic name, it is due to the\r\nfact that they are one and all the manifested Energies of one and the same\r\nLogos, the celestial as well as the terrestrial Messengers and\r\nPermutations of that Principle which is ever in a state of\r\nactivity—conscious during the period of Cosmic Evolution, unconscious\r\n(from our point of view) during Cosmic Rest—for the Logos sleepeth in the\r\nbosom of THAT which “sleepeth not,” nor is it ever awake, for it is Sat or\r\n“Be‐ness,” not a Being. It is from IT that issues the great _Unseen_\r\nLogos, who evolves all the other Logoi; the Primeval Manu who gives being\r\nto the other Manus, who emanate the universe and all in it collectively,\r\nand who represent in their aggregate the _Manifested_ Logos.(693) Hence we\r\nlearn in the Commentaries that while no Dhyân Chohan, not even the\r\nhighest, can realize completely\r\n\r\n_The condition of the preceding Cosmic Evolution, ... the Manus retain a\r\nknowledge of their experiences in all the Cosmic Evolutions throughout\r\nEternity._\r\n\r\nThis is very plain: the first Manu is called Svâyambhuva, the “Self‐\r\nmanifested,” the Son of the _Unmanifested_ Father. The Manus are the\r\nCreators of the Creators of our First Race—the Spirit of Mankind—which\r\ndoes not prevent the _seven_ Manus from having been the first “Pre‐Adamic”\r\nMen on Earth.\r\n\r\nManu declares himself created by Virâj,(694) or Vaishvânara, the Spirit of\r\nHumanity,(695) which means that his Monad emanates from the never resting\r\nPrinciple in the beginning of every new Cosmic Activity—that Logos or\r\nUniversal Monad (collective Elohim) which radiates _from within himself_\r\nall those Cosmic Monads that become the centres of activity—Progenitors of\r\nthe numberless Solar Systems as well as of the yet undifferentiated\r\n_human_ Monads of Planetary Chains as well as of every being thereon.\r\nSvâyambhuva, or Self‐born, is the name of every Cosmic Monad _which\r\nbecomes the Centre of Force, from within which emerges a Planetary Chain_\r\n(of which Chains there are seven in our System). And the radiations of\r\nthis Centre become again so many Manus Svâyambhuva (a mysterious generic\r\nname, meaning far more than appears), each of them becoming, as a Host,\r\nthe Creator of his own Humanity.\r\n\r\nAs to the question of the four distinct Races of mankind that preceded our\r\nFifth Race, there is nothing mystical in the subject, except the ethereal\r\nbodies of the first Races; and this is a matter of legendary, nevertheless\r\nvery correct, history. The legend is universal. And if the Western\r\n_savant_ pleases to see in it only a myth, it does not make the slightest\r\ndifference. The Mexicans had, and still have, the tradition of the\r\nfourfold destruction of the world by fire and water, just as the Egyptians\r\nhad, and the Hindûs have, to this day.\r\n\r\nTrying to account for the community of legends held by Chinese, Chaldæans,\r\nEgyptians, Indians and Greeks, in remote antiquity, and for the absence of\r\nany certain vestige of civilization more ancient than 5,000 years, the\r\nauthor of _Mythical Monsters_ remarks that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We must ... not be surprised if we do not immediately discover the\r\n    vestiges of the people of ten, fifteen, or twenty thousand years\r\n    ago. With an ephemeral architecture ... [as in China], the sites\r\n    of vast cities may have become entirely lost to recollection in a\r\n    few thousands of years from natural decay, and how much more ...\r\n    if ... minor cataclysms have intervened, such as local\r\n    inundations, earthquakes, deposition of volcanic ashes, ... the\r\n    spread of sandy deserts, destruction of life by deadly pestilence,\r\n    by miasma, or by the outpour of sulphurous fumes.(696)\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many of such cataclysms have changed the whole surface of the earth\r\nmay be inferred from the following Stanza of Commentary Twenty‐two:\r\n\r\n_During the first seven crores [70,000,000 years] of the Kalpa the Earth\r\nand its two Kingdoms [mineral and vegetable], one already having achieved\r\nits seventh circle, the other, hardly nascent, are luminous and semi‐\r\nethereal, cold, lifeless, and translucid. In the eleventh crore_(_697_)_\r\nthe Mother [Earth] grows opaque, and in the fourteenth_(_698_)_ the throes\r\nof adolescence take place. These convulsions of Nature [geological\r\nchanges] last till her twentieth crore of years, uninterruptedly, after\r\nwhich they become periodical, and at long intervals._\r\n\r\n_The last change took place nearly twelve crores [120,000,000] of years\r\nago. But the Earth with everything on her face had become cool, hard and\r\nsettled ages earlier._\r\n\r\nThus, if we are to believe Esoteric Teaching, _universal_ geological\r\ndisturbances and changes have not occurred for the last 120 million years,\r\nbut the Earth, even before that time, was ready to receive her human\r\nstock. The appearance of the latter, however, in its full physical\r\ndevelopment, as already stated, took place only about 18,000,000 years\r\nago, after the first great failure of Nature to create beings\r\nalone—_i.e._, without the help of the divine “Fashioners”—had been\r\nfollowed by the successive evolution of the first three Races.(699) The\r\nactual duration of the first two and a half Races is withheld from all but\r\nthe higher Initiates. The history of the Races begins at the separation of\r\nthe sexes, when the preceding egg‐bearing androgynous Race perished\r\nrapidly, and the subsequent sub‐races of the Third Root‐Race appeared as\r\nan entirely new race _physiologically_. It is this “Destruction” which is\r\nallegorically called the great “Vaivasvata Manu Deluge,” when the account\r\nshows Vaivasvata Manu, or Humanity, remaining alone on Earth in the Ark of\r\nSalvation towed by Vishnu in the shape of a monstrous fish, and the Seven\r\nRishis “with him.” The allegory is very plain.\r\n\r\nIn the symbolism of every nation, the “Deluge” stands for chaotic\r\nunsettled Matter—Chaos itself; and Water for the Feminine Principle—the\r\n“Great Deep.” As the Greek Lexicon of Parkhurst gives it:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ἀρχὴ answers to the Hebrew _rasit_, or Wisdom ... and [at the same\r\n    time] to the emblem of the female generative power, the _arg_ or\r\n    _arca_, in which the germ of nature [and of mankind] floats or\r\n    broods on the great abyss of the waters, during the interval which\r\n    takes place after every mundane [or racial] cycle.\r\n\r\n\r\nArchê (Ἀρχὴ) or Ark is also the mystic name of the Divine Spirit of Life\r\nwhich broods over Chaos. Now Vishnu _is_ the Divine Spirit, as an abstract\r\nprinciple, and also as the Preserver and Generator, or Giver of Life—the\r\nthird Person of the Trimûrti—composed of Brahmâ, the Creator, Shiva, the\r\nDestroyer, and Vishnu, the Preserver. Vishnu is shown, in the allegory,\r\nunder the form of a _Fish_, guiding the Ark of Vaivasvata Manu across the\r\nWaters of the Flood. There is no use in expatiating upon the esoteric\r\nmeaning of the word _Fish_ (as Payne Knight, Inman, Gerald Massey, and\r\nothers have done). Its theological meaning is phallic, but the\r\nmetaphysical, divine. Jesus was called the Fish, as were Vishnu and\r\nBacchus; ΙΗΣ, the “Saviour” of Mankind, being but the monogram of the God\r\nBacchus, who was also called ΙΧΘΥΣ, the Fish.(700) Moreover, the Seven\r\nRishis in the Ark symbolized the seven “principles,” which became complete\r\nin man only after he had separated, and become a _human_, and thus ceased\r\nto be a divine creature.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the Races; details as to the submersion of the Continent\r\ninhabited by the Second Root‐Race are not numerous. The history of the\r\nThird, or Lemuria, is given, as is also that of Atlantis, but the others\r\nare only alluded to. Lemuria is said to have perished about 700,000 years\r\nbefore the commencement of what is now called the Tertiary Age (the\r\nEocene).(701) During this Deluge—an actual geological deluge this\r\ntime—Vaivasvata Manu is also shown saving mankind, allegorically—in\r\nreality, a portion of it, the Fourth Race—just as he saved the Fifth Race\r\nduring the destruction of the last Atlanteans, the remnants that perished\r\n850,000 years ago,(702) after which there was no great submersion until\r\nthe day of Plato’s Atlantis, or Poseidonis, which was known to the\r\nEgyptians only because it happened in such relatively recent times.\r\n\r\nIt is the submersion of the great Atlantis which is the most interesting.\r\nThis is the Cataclysm of which the old records, as in the _Book of Enoch_,\r\nsay, “the ends of the Earth got loose”; and upon which have been built the\r\nlegends and allegories of Vaivasvata, Xisuthrus, Noah, Deucalion and all\r\nthe _tutti quanti_ of the Elect Saved. Tradition, not taking into account\r\nthe difference between sidereal and geological phenomena, calls both\r\n“Deluges” indifferently. Yet there is a great difference. The Cataclysm\r\nwhich destroyed the huge Continent of which Australia is the largest\r\nrelic, was due to a series of subterranean convulsions and the breaking\r\nasunder of the ocean floors. That which put an end to its successor—the\r\nFourth Continent—was brought on by successive disturbances in the axial\r\nrotation. It began during the earliest Tertiary periods, and, continuing\r\nfor long ages, carried away successively the last vestige of Atlantis,\r\nwith the exception, perhaps, of Ceylon and a small portion of what is now\r\nAfrica. It changed the face of the globe, and no memory of its flourishing\r\ncontinents and isles, of its civilizations and sciences, have remained in\r\nthe annals of history, save in the Sacred Records of the East.\r\n\r\nHence, Modern Science denies the existence of Atlantis. It even denies any\r\nviolent shiftings of the Earth’s axis, and would attribute the change of\r\nclimate to other causes. But this question is still an open one. If Dr.\r\nCroll will have it that all such alterations can be accounted for by the\r\neffects of nutation and the precession of the equinoxes, there are others,\r\nsuch as Sir Henry James and Sir John Lubbock,(703) who feel more inclined\r\nto accept the idea that they are due to a change in the position of the\r\naxis of rotation. Against this the majority of the Astronomers are again\r\narrayed. But then, what have they not denied before now, and what have\r\nthey not denounced—only to accept it later on, whenever the hypothesis\r\nbecame undeniable fact?\r\n\r\nHow far our figures agree, or rather disagree, with Modern Science will be\r\nseen further in the Addenda to this Volume, where the Geology and\r\nAnthropology of our modern day are carefully compared with the teachings\r\nof Archaic Science. At any rate, the period assigned by the Secret\r\nDoctrine for the sinking of Atlantis, does not seem to disagree very much\r\nwith the calculations of Modern Science, which, however, calls Atlantis\r\n“Lemuria” whenever it accepts such a submerged Continent. With regard to\r\nthe pre‐human period, all that can be said, at present, is, that even\r\nprior to the appearance of the “mindless” First Race, the Earth was not\r\nwithout its inhabitants. We might, however, add that what Science, which\r\nrecognizes _physical man only_, has a right to regard as the _pre‐human_\r\nperiod, may be conceded to have extended from the First Race down to the\r\nfirst half of the Atlantean Race, since it is only then that man became\r\nthe “complete _organic_ being he is now.” And this would make Adamic Man\r\nno older than a few millions of years.(704)\r\n\r\nThe author of the _Qabbalah_ truly remarks that: “Man to‐day, as an\r\nindividual, is only a concatenation of the being‐hood of precedent human\r\nlife,” or _lives_, rather.\r\n\r\n\r\n    According to the Qabbalah, the soul sparks contained in Adam, went\r\n    into three principal classes corresponding to his three sons,\r\n    viz.: _Hesed_, Habel, _Ge’boor‐ah_, Qai‐yin and _Ra’h‐min_ Seth.\r\n    These three were divided into ... 70 species, called; the\r\n    principal roots of the human race.(705)\r\n\r\n    Said Rabbi Yehudah: “How many garments [of the incorporeal man]\r\n    are these which are crowned (from the day man was created)?” Said\r\n    R. El’azar: “The mountains of the world (the great men of the\r\n    generation) are in discussion upon it, but there are three: one to\r\n    clothe in that garment the _Rua’h_ spirit, which is in the garden\r\n    (of Eden) on earth: one which is more precious than all, in which\r\n    the _Neshamah_ is clothed in that Bundle of Life, between the\r\n    angels of the Kings ...: and one outside garment, which exists and\r\n    does not exist, is seen and not seen. In that garment, the\r\n    _Nephesh_ is clothed, and she goes and flies in it, to and fro in\r\n    the world.”(706)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis relates to the Races, their “garments,” or degree of materiality, and\r\nto the three “principles” of man in their three vehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStanza XI. The Civilization And Destruction Of The Fourth And Fifth Races.\r\n\r\n\r\n    43. The Lemuro‐Atlanteans build cities and spread civilization.\r\n    The incipient stage of anthropomorphism. 44. Statues, witnesses to\r\n    the size of the Lemuro‐Atlanteans. 45. Lemuria destroyed by fire,\r\n    Atlantis by water. The Flood. 46. The destruction of the Fourth\r\n    Race and of the last antediluvian monster‐animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n43. THEY(707) BUILT HUGE CITIES. OF RARE EARTHS AND METALS THEY BUILT. OUT\r\nOF THE FIRES(708) VOMITED, OUT OF THE WHITE STONE(709) OF THE MOUNTAINS\r\nAND OF THE BLACK STONE,(710) THEY CUT THEIR OWN IMAGES, IN THEIR SIZE AND\r\nLIKENESS, AND WORSHIPPED THEM.\r\n\r\nAt this point, as the history of the first two _human_ races—the last of\r\nthe Lemurians and the first of the future Atlanteans—proceeds, we have to\r\nblend the two, and speak of them for a time collectively.\r\n\r\nHere reference is also made to the _divine_ Dynasties, which were claimed\r\nby the Egyptians, Chaldæans, Greeks, etc., to have preceded their _human_\r\nKings. These are still believed in by the modern Hindûs, and are\r\nenumerated in their sacred books. Of these, however, we shall treat in\r\ntheir proper place. What remains to be shown is, that our modern\r\nGeologists are now being driven into admitting the demonstrable existence\r\nof submerged continents. But to confess the existence of the continents is\r\nquite a different thing from admitting that there were men on them during\r\nthe early geological periods(711)—ay, men and civilized nations, not\r\nPalæolithic savages only; who, under the guidance of their _divine_\r\nRulers, built large cities, cultivated Arts and Sciences, and knew\r\nAstronomy, Architecture and Mathematics to perfection. The primeval\r\ncivilization of the Lemurians did not, as one may think, immediately\r\nfollow their physiological transformation. Between the final physiological\r\nevolution and the first city built, many hundred thousands of years had\r\npassed. Nevertheless, we find the Lemurians in their sixth sub‐race\r\nbuilding their first rock‐cities out of stone and lava.(712) One of these\r\ngreat cities of primitive structure was built entirely of lava, some\r\nthirty miles west from where Easter Island now stretches its narrow strip\r\nof sterile ground, and was totally destroyed by a series of volcanic\r\neruptions. The oldest remains of Cyclopean buildings were all the\r\nhandiwork of the last sub‐races of the Lemurians; and an Occultist,\r\ntherefore, shows no surprise on learning that the stone relics which were\r\nfound on the small piece of land called Easter Island by Captain Cook, are\r\n\r\n\r\n    Very much like the walls of the Temple of Pachacamac or the Ruins\r\n    of Tia‐Huanaco in Peru,(713)\r\n\r\n\r\nand also that they are in the _Cyclopean style_. The first large cities,\r\nhowever, were built in that region of the Continent which is now known as\r\nthe island of Madagascar. There were civilized people and savages in those\r\ndays as there are now. Evolution achieved its work of perfection on the\r\nformer, and Karma—its work of destruction on the latter. The Australians\r\nand their like are the descendants of those, who, instead of vivifying the\r\nSpark projected into them by the “Flames,” extinguished it by long\r\ngenerations of bestiality.(714) Whereas the Âryan nations could trace\r\ntheir descent through the Atlanteans from the more spiritual races of the\r\nLemurians, in whom the “Sons of Wisdom” had personally incarnated.(715)\r\n\r\nIt is with the advent of the divine Dynasties that the first civilizations\r\nwere started. And while, in some regions of the Earth, a portion of\r\nmankind preferred leading a nomadic and patriarchal life, and in others\r\nsavage man was hardly learning to build a fire and to protect himself\r\nagainst the Elements—his brothers, more favoured than he by their Karma,\r\nand helped by the divine intelligence which informed them, built cities,\r\nand cultivated Arts and Sciences. Nevertheless, notwithstanding\r\ncivilization, while their pastoral brethren enjoyed wondrous powers as\r\ntheir birthright, the “builders” could now obtain their powers only\r\ngradually; even those they did obtain being generally used for conquest\r\nover physical nature and selfish and unholy purposes. Civilization has\r\never developed the physical and the intellectual at the cost of the\r\npsychic and spiritual. The command over and the guidance of one’s own\r\npsychic nature, which foolish men now associate with the supernatural,\r\nwere with early Humanity innate and congenital, and came to man as\r\nnaturally as walking and thinking.\r\n\r\n“There is no such thing as magic” philosophizes “She”—the author\r\nforgetting that “magic” in early days still meant the great Science of\r\nWisdom, and that Ayesha could not possibly know anything of the modern\r\nperversion of thought—“though,” she adds, “there is such a thing as\r\nknowledge of the Secrets of Nature.”(716) But they have become “Secrets”\r\nonly in our Race, and were public property with the Third.\r\n\r\nGradually, mankind decreased in stature, for, even before the real advent\r\nof the Fourth or Atlantean Race, the majority of mankind had fallen into\r\niniquity and sin, save only the Hierarchy of the “Elect,” the followers\r\nand disciples of the “Sons of Will and Yoga”—called later the “Sons of the\r\nFire‐Mist.”\r\n\r\nThen came the Atlanteans; the giants whose physical beauty and strength\r\nreached their climax, in accordance with evolutionary law, toward the\r\nmiddle period of their fourth sub‐race. But, as said in the Commentary:\r\n\r\n_The last survivors of the fair child of the White Island [the primitive\r\nShveta‐dvîpa] had perished ages before. Their [Lemuria’s] Elect, had taken\r\nshelter on the Sacred Island [now the __“__fabled__”__ Shamballah, in the\r\nGobi Desert], while some of their accursed races, separating from the main\r\nstock, now lived in the jungles and underground [__“__cave‐men__”__], when\r\nthe golden yellow Race [the Fourth] became in its turn __“__black with\r\nsin.__”__ From pole to pole the Earth had changed her face for the third\r\ntime, and was no longer inhabited by the Sons of Shveta‐dvîpa, the\r\nblessed, and Adbhitanya [?], east and west, the first, the one and the\r\npure, had become corrupted.... The Demi‐Gods of the Third had made room\r\nfor the Semi‐Demons of the Fourth Race. Shveta‐dvîpa,_(_717_)_ the White\r\nIsland, had veiled her face. Her children now lived on the Black Land,\r\nwherein, later on, Daityas from the seventh Dvîpa (Pushkara) and Râkshasas\r\nfrom the seventh climate replaced the Sâdhus and the Ascetics of the Third\r\nAge, who had descended to them from other and higher regions...._\r\n\r\nIn their dead letter, the _Purânas_, in general, read like an absurd\r\ntissue of fairy tales and no better. And if one were to read the first\r\nthree chapters of Book II of _Vishnu Purâna_ and accept _verbatim_ the\r\ngeography, geodesy, and ethnology in the account of Priyavrata’s seven\r\nsons among whom their father divides the seven Dvîpas (Islands or\r\nContinents); and then proceed to study how his eldest son, Agnîdhra, the\r\nKing of Jambu‐dvîpa, apportioned Jambu‐dvîpa among his nine sons; and then\r\nhow Nâbhi, _his_ son, had a hundred sons and apportioned lands to all\r\nthese in his turn—he would most likely throw the book away and pronounce\r\nit a farrago of nonsense. But the student of Esotericism will understand\r\nthat, when the _Purânas_ were written, their true meaning was intended to\r\nbe clear only to the Initiated Brâhmans, and so the compilers wrote these\r\nworks allegorically and would not give the _whole_ truth to the masses.\r\nAnd he will, further, explain to the Orientalists—who, beginning with\r\nColonel Wilford and ending with Professor Weber, have made and still are\r\nmaking such a mess of it—that the first three chapters purposely confuse\r\nthe following subjects and events:\r\n\r\nI. The series of Kalpas, or Ages, and also of Races, are never taken into\r\naccount; and events which have happened in one are allowed to stand along\r\nwith those which took place in another. The chronological order is\r\nentirely ignored. This is shown by several of the Sanskrit commentators,\r\nwho explain the incompatibility of events and calculations in saying:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Whenever any contradictions in different Purânas are observed,\r\n    they are ascribed ... to differences of Kalpas and the like.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. The several meanings of the words “Manvantara” and “Kalpa” or Age, are\r\nwithheld, the general signification only being given.\r\n\r\nIII. In the genealogy of the Kings and the geography of their dominions,\r\nthe Varshas (countries) and Dvîpas are all regarded as terrestrial\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nNow, the truth is that, without entering into too minute details, it is\r\npermissible and easy to show that:\r\n\r\n(_a_) The Seven Dvîpas apportioned to Priyavrata’s septenary progeny refer\r\nto several localities—first of all to our Planetary Chain. In this Jambu‐\r\ndvîpa alone represents our Globe, while the six others are the (to us)\r\ninvisible companion Globes of the Chain. This is shown by the very nature\r\nof the allegorical and symbolic descriptions. Jambu‐dvîpa “is _in the\r\ncentre of all_ these”—the so‐called “Insular Continents”—and is surrounded\r\nby a _sea of salt water_ (Lavana), whereas Plaksha, Shâlmalia, Kusha,\r\nKrauncha, Shâka, and Pushkara, are surrounded severally “by great seas ...\r\nof sugar‐cane juice, of wine, of clarified butter, of curds, of milk,”\r\netc., and such like metaphorical names.(718)\r\n\r\n(_b_) Bhâskara Âchârya, who uses expressions from the books of the Secret\r\nDoctrine, in his description of the sidereal position of all these Dvîpas,\r\nspeaks of: “the sea of milk and the sea of curds,” etc., as meaning the\r\nMilky Way, and the various congeries of Nebulæ; the more so, since he\r\ncalls “the country to the south of the equator” Bhûr Loka, that to the\r\nnorth Bhuva, Svar, Mahar, Jana, Tapo and Satya Lokas; and adds: “These\r\nlokas are gradually attained by increasing religious merits,” _i.e._, they\r\nare various “Paradises.”(719)\r\n\r\n(_c_) That this geographical distribution of seven allegorical continents,\r\nislands, mountains, seas and countries, does not belong only to _our_\r\nRound, or even to _our_ Races—the name of Bhârata‐varsha (India)\r\nnotwithstanding—is explained in the texts themselves by the narrator of\r\n_Vishnu Purâna_, who tells us that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Bharata [the son of Nâbhi, who gave his name to Bhârata‐varsha or\r\n    India] ... consigned the kingdom to his son Sumati ... and\r\n    abandoned his life at ... Shâlagrâma. He was afterwards born\r\n    again, as a Brahman, in a distinguished family of ascetics....\r\n    Under these princes [Bharata’s descendants] Bhârata‐varsha was\r\n    divided into nine portions; and their descendants successively\r\n    held possession of the country for seventy‐one periods of the\r\n    aggregate of the four ages (or for the reign of a Manu)\r\n    [representing a Mahâyuga of 4,320,000 years].(720)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut having said so much, Parâshara suddenly explains that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    This was the creation of Svâyambhuva (Manu), by which the earth\r\n    was peopled when he presided over the _first_ Manvantara, in the\r\n    Kalpa of Varâha [_i.e._, the _Boar_ incarnation, or Avatâra].\r\n\r\n\r\nNow every Brâhman knows that _our_ Humanity began on this Earth (or Round)\r\n_only with Vaivasvata Manu_. And if the Western reader turns to the sub‐\r\nsection on “The Primeval Manus of Humanity,”(721) he will see that\r\nVaivasvata is the _seventh_ of the fourteen Manus who preside over our\r\nPlanetary Chain during its Life Cycle; but as every Round has two Manus (a\r\nRoot‐ and a Seed‐Manu), he is the Root‐Manu of the Fourth Round, hence the\r\nseventh. Wilson finds in this only incongruity, and speculates that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The patriarchial genealogies are older than the chronological\r\n    system of Manvantaras and Kalpas, and [thus] have been rather\r\n    clumsily distributed amongst the different periods.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is nothing of the kind; but as Orientalists know nothing of the Secret\r\nTeaching, they persist in taking everything _literally_, and then turn\r\nround and abuse the writers for that which they do not comprehend!\r\n\r\nThese Genealogies embrace a period of _three and a half_ Rounds; they\r\nspeak of _pre‐human_ periods, and explain the descent into generation of\r\nevery Manu—the first manifested sparks of the One Unity—and, furthermore,\r\nshow each of these human Sparks dividing into, and multiplying by, first,\r\nthe Pitaras, the human Ancestors, then by the human Races. No Being can\r\nbecome God, or Deva, unless he passes through the human Cycles. Therefore\r\nthe Shloka says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Happy are those who are born, even from the [latent] condition of\r\n    gods, _as men_, in Bhârata‐varsha; as that is the way to ... final\r\n    liberation.(722)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Jambu‐dvîpa Bhârata is considered _the best of its divisions_, because\r\nit is _the land of works_. In it alone it is that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The succession of four Yugas, or ages, the Krita, the Tretâ, the\r\n    Dvâpara, and Kali take place.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, Parâshara, on being asked by Maitreya “to give him the\r\ndescriptions of the Earth,” returns again to the enumeration of the same\r\nDvîpas with the same seas, etc., as those he had described in the\r\nSvâyambhuva Manvantara—it is simply a “blind”; yet, to him who reads\r\nbetween the lines, the Four great Races and the Fifth are there, ay, with\r\ntheir sub‐divisions, islands and continents, some of which were called by\r\nthe names of celestial Lokas, and by those of other Globes. Hence the\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nAll these islands and lands are called by the Orientalists “mythical” and\r\n“fabulous.”(723) Very true, some are _not of this Earth_, but they still\r\nexist. The White Island and Atala, at all events, are no myths, since\r\nAtala was the name contemptuously applied by the earliest pioneers of the\r\nFifth Race to the Land of Sin—Atlantis, in general, not to Plato’s island\r\nalone; and since the White Island was (_a_) the Shveta‐dvîpa of Theogony,\r\nand (_b_) Shâka‐dvîpa, or Atlantis (its earliest portions rather) in its\r\nbeginnings. This was when it yet had its “seven holy rivers that washed\r\naway all sin,” and its “seven districts, wherein there was no dereliction\r\nof virtue, no contention, no deviation from virtue,” as it was then\r\ninhabited by the caste of the Magas—that caste which even the Brâhmans\r\nacknowledged as not inferior to their own, and which was the nursery of\r\nthe first Zarathushtra. The Brâhmans are shown consulting with Gauramukha,\r\non Nârada’s advice, who told them to invite the Magas as priests of the\r\nSun to the temple built by Sâmba the _reputed_ son of Krishna, for in\r\nreality the latter had none. In this the _Purânas_ are _historical_,\r\nallegory notwithstanding, and Occultism is stating facts.\r\n\r\nThe whole story is told in _Bhavishya Purâna_. It is stated that Sâmba\r\nhaving been cured of leprosy by Sûrya (the Sun), built a temple and\r\ndedicated it to the Deity. But when he was looking for pious Brâhmans to\r\nperform the appointed rites in it, and receive donations made to the God,\r\nNârada—the virgin Ascetic who is found in every age in the\r\n_Purânas_—advised him not to do so, as Manu forbade the Brâhmans to\r\nreceive emoluments for the performance of religious rites. He therefore\r\nreferred Sâmba to Gauramukha (White‐face), the Purohita, or family priest,\r\nof Ugrasena, King of Mathura, who would tell him whom he could best\r\nemploy. The priest directed Sâmba to invite the Magas, the worshippers of\r\nSûrya, to discharge the duty. But as he was ignorant of the place where\r\nthey lived, Sûrya, the Sun himself, directs Sâmba to Shâka‐dvîpa _beyond\r\nthe salt water_. Then Sâmba performs the journey, using Garuda, the Great\r\nBird, the vehicle of Vishnu and Krishna, who transports him to the Magas,\r\netc.(724)\r\n\r\nNow Krishna, who lived 5,000 years ago, and Nârada, who is found reborn in\r\nevery Cycle (or Race), in addition to Garuda—the symbol Esoterically of\r\nthe Great Cycle—give the key to the allegory; nevertheless the Magas are\r\nthe Magi of Chaldæa, and their caste and worship were born on the earlier\r\nAtlantis, in Shâka‐dvîpa, the Sinless. All the Orientalists are agreed\r\nthat the Magas of Shâka‐dvîpa are the forefathers of the fire‐worshipping\r\nParsîs. Our quarrel with them rests, as usual, on their dwarfing periods\r\nof hundreds of thousands of years this time into only a few centuries; in\r\nspite of Nârada and Sâmba, they carry the event only to the days of the\r\nflight of the Parsîs to Gujerat. This is simply absurd, as this took place\r\nonly in the eighth century of our era. True, the Magas are credited in the\r\n_Bhavishya Purâna_ with still living in Shâka‐dvîpa in the day of\r\nKrishna’s “son,” nevertheless the last portion of that Continent—Plato’s\r\n“Atlantis”—had perished 6,000 years before. They were Magas “late of”\r\nShâkadvîpa, and in those days lived in Chaldæa. This, again, is an\r\nintentional confusion.\r\n\r\nThe earliest pioneers of the Fourth Race were not Atlanteans, nor yet were\r\nthey the human Asuras and the Râkshasas which they became later. In those\r\ndays large portions of the future Continent of Atlantis were yet part and\r\nparcel of the ocean floors. Lemuria, as we have called the Continent of\r\nthe Third Race, was then a gigantic land.(725) It covered the whole area\r\nfrom the foot of the Himâlayas, which separated it from the inland sea\r\nrolling its waves over what is now Tibet, Mongolia, and the Great Desert\r\nof Shamo (Gobi); from Chittagong, westward to Hardwar, and eastward to\r\nAssam [? Annam]. From thence, it stretched south across what is known to\r\nus as Southern India, Ceylon, and Sumatra; then embracing on its way, as\r\nwe go south, Madagascar on its right hand and Australia and Tasmania on\r\nits left, it ran down to within a few degrees of the Antarctic Circle; and\r\nfrom Australia, an inland region on the Mother Continent in those ages, it\r\nextended far into the Pacific Ocean, beyond Rapa‐nui (Teapy, or Easter\r\nIsland) which now lies in latitude 26°S., and longitude 110°W.(726) This\r\nstatement seems to be corroborated by Science—even if only partially. When\r\ndiscussing continental trends, and showing the infra‐Arctic masses\r\ntrending generally with the meridian, several ancient continents are\r\nmentioned, though inferentially. Among such are mentioned the “Mascarene\r\ncontinent,” which included Madagascar, stretching north and south, and\r\nanother ancient continent which “stretched from Spitzbergen to the Straits\r\nof Dover, while most of the other parts of Europe were sea bottom.”(727)\r\nThis corroborates the Occult teaching which says that what are now the\r\npolar regions were formerly the earliest of the seven cradles of Humanity,\r\nand the tomb of the bulk of the Mankind of that region during the Third\r\nRace, when the gigantic Continent of Lemuria began separating into smaller\r\ncontinents. This is due, according to the explanation in the Commentary,\r\nto a decrease of velocity in the Earth’s rotation:\r\n\r\n_When the Wheel runs at the usual rate, its extremities [the poles] agree\r\nwith its middle Circle [the equator], when it runs slower and tilts in\r\nevery direction, there is a great disturbance on the face of the Earth.\r\nThe waters flow toward the two ends, and new lands arise in the middle\r\nBelt [equatorial lands], while those at the ends are subject to Pralayas\r\nby submersion._\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n_Thus the Wheel [the Earth] is subject to, and regulated by, the Spirit of\r\nthe Moon, for the breath of its waters [tides]. Toward the close of the\r\nage [Kalpa] of a great [Root‐] Race, the Regents of the Moon [the Fathers,\r\nor Pitris] begin drawing harder, and thus flatten the Wheel about its\r\nBelt, when it goes down in some places and swells in others, and the\r\nswelling running toward the extremities [poles], new lands will arise and\r\nold ones be sucked in._\r\n\r\nWe have only to read astronomical and geological works, to see the meaning\r\nof the above very clearly. Scientists—_modern_ Specialists—have\r\nascertained the influence of the tides on the geological distribution of\r\nland and water on the planet, and have noted the shifting of the oceans\r\nwith a corresponding subsidence and rise of continents and new lands.\r\nScience knows, or thinks it knows, that this occurs periodically.(728)\r\nProfessor Todd believes he can trace the series of oscillations backward\r\nto the periods of the Earth’s first incrustation.(729) Therefore it seems\r\neasy for Science to verify the Esoteric statement. We propose to treat of\r\nthis at greater length in the Addenda.\r\n\r\nSome Theosophists who have understood from a few words in _Esoteric\r\nBuddhism_ that “old continents” which have been submerged will reäppear,\r\nhave asked the question: “What will Atlantis be like when raised?” Here,\r\nagain, there is a slight misconception. Were identically the _same_ lands\r\nof Atlantis that were submerged to be raised again, then they would,\r\nindeed, be _barren for ages_. But because the Atlantic sea‐bottom is\r\ncovered with some 5,000 feet of chalk at present, and more is forming—a\r\nnew “cretaceous formation” of strata, in fact—that is no reason why, when\r\nthe time for a new Continent to appear arrives, a geological convulsion\r\nand upraising of the sea‐bottom should not dispose of these 5,000 feet of\r\nchalk for the formation of some mountains and 5,000 more come to the\r\nsurface. The Racial Cataclysms are not a Noah’s Deluge of forty days—a\r\nkind of Bombay monsoon.\r\n\r\nThat the periodical sinking and reäppearance of the mighty Continents, now\r\ncalled Atlantis and Lemuria by modern writers, is no fiction, will be\r\ndemonstrated in the Section in which all the evidence has been collated\r\ntogether. The most archaic Sanskrit and Tamil works teem with references\r\nto both Continents. The seven sacred Islands (Dvîpas) are mentioned in the\r\n_Sûrya Siddhânta_, the oldest astronomical work in the whole world, and in\r\nthe works of Asura Maya, the Atlantean Astronomer whom Professor Weber has\r\nmade out to be “reïncarnated” in Ptolemy. Yet, it is a mistake to call\r\nthese “Sacred Islands” Atlantean—as is done by us; for, like everything\r\nelse in the Hindû Sacred Books, they are made to refer to several things.\r\nThe heirloom left by Priyavrata, the Son of Svâyambhuva Manu, to his seven\r\nsons—was not Atlantis, even though one or two of these Islands survived\r\nthe subsidence of their fellows, and offered shelter, ages later, to\r\nAtlanteans, whose Continent had been submerged in its turn. When first\r\nmentioned by Parâshara in the _Vishnu Purâna_, the seven refer to an\r\nEsoteric Doctrine which is explained further on. In this connection, of\r\nall the seven Islands, Jambu‐dvîpa (our Globe) is the only one that is\r\nterrestrial. In the _Purânas_ every reference to the North of Meru is\r\nconnected with that Primeval Eldorado, now the North Polar region, which,\r\nwhen the magnolia blossomed where now we see an unexplored endless desert\r\nof ice, was then a Continent. Science speaks of an “ancient continent”\r\nwhich stretched from Spitzbergen down to the Straits of Dover. The Secret\r\nDoctrine teaches that, in the earliest geological periods, these regions\r\nformed a horse‐shoe‐like continent, whose one end, the Eastern, far more\r\nnorthward than North Cornwall, included Greenland, and the other contained\r\nBehring’s Straits as an inland piece of ground, and descended southward in\r\nits natural trend down to the British Isles, which in those days must have\r\nbeen right under the lower curve of the semi‐circle. This Continent was\r\nraised simultaneously with the submersion of the equatorial portions of\r\nLemuria. Ages later, some of the Lemurian remains reäppeared again on the\r\nface of the oceans. Therefore, though it can be said, without departing\r\nfrom truth, that Atlantis is included in the seven great Insular\r\nContinents since the Fourth Race Atlanteans came into possession of some\r\nof the Lemurian relics, and settling on the islands, included them among\r\n_their_ lands and continents, yet a difference should be made and an\r\nexplanation given, once that a fuller and more accurate account is\r\nattempted, as in the present work. Easter Island was also taken possession\r\nof in this manner by some Atlanteans; who, having escaped from the\r\nCataclysm which befell their own land, settled on this remnant of Lemuria,\r\nbut only to perish thereon, when it was destroyed in one day by volcanic\r\nfires and lava. This may be regarded as fiction by certain Geographers and\r\nGeologists; to the Occultists, however, it is _history_. What does Science\r\nknow to the contrary?\r\n\r\n\r\n    Until the appearance of a map, published at Basle in 1522, wherein\r\n    the name of America appears for the first time, _the latter was\r\n    believed to be part of India_.... Science also refuses to sanction\r\n    the wild hypothesis that there was a time when the Indian\r\n    peninsula at one end of the line, and South America at the other,\r\n    connected by a belt of islands and continents. The India of the\r\n    pre‐historic ages ... was doubly connected with the two Americas.\r\n    The lands of the ancestors of those whom Ammianus Marcellinus\r\n    calls the “Brâhmans of Upper India,” stretched from Kashmir far\r\n    into the (now) deserts of Shamo. A pedestrian from the north might\r\n    then have reached—hardly wetting his feet—the Alaskan Peninsula,\r\n    through Manchooria, across the _future_ Gulf of Tartary, the\r\n    Kurile and Aleutian Islands; while another traveller, furnished\r\n    with a canoe, and starting from the south, could have walked over\r\n    from Siam, crossed the Polynesian Islands and trudged into any\r\n    part of the continent of South America.(730)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was written from the words of a Master—a rather doubtful authority\r\nfor the Materialists and Sceptics. But here we have one of their own\r\nflock, and a bird of the same feather, Ernst Hæckel, who, in _his_\r\ndistribution of races, corroborates the statement almost _verbatim_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It would seem that the region on the earth’s surface where the\r\n    evolution of these primitive men from the _closely related\r\n    catarrhine apes_ [!!] took place, must be sought either in\r\n    Southern Asia or Eastern Africa [which, by the bye, was not even\r\n    in existence when the Third Race flourished], or in Lemuria.\r\n    Lemuria is an ancient continent now sunk beneath the waters of the\r\n    Indian Ocean which, lying to the South of the Asia of to‐day,\r\n    stretched on the one hand eastwards to Upper India and Sunda\r\n    Island, on the other westward as far as Madagascar and\r\n    Africa.(731)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the epoch of which we are treating, the Continent of Lemuria had\r\nalready broken asunder in many places, and formed new separate continents.\r\nNevertheless, neither Africa nor the Americas, still less Europe, existed\r\nin those days; all of them slumbering as yet on the ocean‐floors. Nor was\r\nthere much of present Asia; for the Cis‐Himâlayan regions were covered\r\nwith seas, and beyond them stretched the “lotus leaves” of Shveta‐dvîpa,\r\nthe countries now called Greenland, Eastern and Western Siberia, etc. The\r\nimmense Continent, which had once reigned supreme over the Indian,\r\nAtlantic, and Pacific Oceans, now consisted of huge islands which were\r\ngradually disappearing one after the other, until the final convulsion\r\nengulfed the last remains of it. Easter Island, for instance, belongs to\r\nthe earliest civilization of the Third Race. It was a volcanic and sudden\r\nuplifting of the ocean‐floor, which raised this small relic of the Archaic\r\nAges—after it had been submerged with the rest—untouched, with its volcano\r\nand statues, during the Champlain epoch of north polar submersion, as a\r\nstanding witness to the existence of Lemuria. It is said that some of the\r\nAustralian tribes are the last remnants of the last descendants of the\r\nThird Race.\r\n\r\nIn this we are again corroborated to a degree by Materialistic Science.\r\nHæckel, when speaking of Blumenbach’s brown or Malay race, and the\r\nAustralians and Papuans, remarks:\r\n\r\n\r\n    There is much likeness between these last and the Aborigines of\r\n    Polynesia, that Australian island‐world, that _seems to have been\r\n    once on a time a gigantic and continuous continent_.(732)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt certainly was “a gigantic and continuous continent,” for, during the\r\nThird Race, it stretched east and west, as far as where the two Americas\r\nnow lie. The present Australia was but a portion of it, and in addition to\r\nthis there are a few surviving islands strewn hither and thither on the\r\nface of the Pacific, and a large strip of California, which belonged to\r\nit. Funnily enough, Hæckel, in his fantastic _Pedigree of Man_, considers:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Australians of to‐day as the lineal descendants, almost\r\n    unchanged [?!], of that _second_ branch of the primitive human\r\n    race ... that spread northwards, at first chiefly in Asia, from\r\n    the home of man’s infancy, and seems to have been the parent of\r\n    all the other straight‐haired races of men.... The one, woolly‐\r\n    haired, migrated in part westwards [_i.e._, to Africa and\r\n    eastwards to New Guinea, which countries had then, as said, no\r\n    existence as yet].... The other, straight‐haired, was evolved\r\n    farther to the North, in Asia, and ... peopled Australia.(733)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs writes a Master:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Behold the relics of that once great nation [Lemuria of the Third\r\n    Race] in _some_ of the flat‐headed aborigines of your\r\n    Australia.(734)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut they belong to the last remnants of the seventh sub‐race of the Third.\r\nProfessor Hæckel must also have _dreamt_ a dream and seen for once a\r\n_true_ vision!\r\n\r\nIt is to this period that we have to look for the first appearance of the\r\nancestors of those, whom we term the most ancient peoples of the world—now\r\ncalled respectively the Âryan Hindûs, the Egyptians, and the oldest\r\nPersians, on the one hand, and the Chaldees and Phœnicians on the other.\r\nThese were governed by the Divine Dynasties, _i.e._, Kings and Rulers who\r\nhad of mortal man only his physical appearance _as it was then_, but who\r\nwere Beings from Spheres higher and more celestial than our own Sphere\r\nwill be, long Manvantaras hence. It is, of course, useless to attempt to\r\nforce the existence of such Beings on sceptics. _Their_ greatest pride\r\nconsists in proving their patronymic denomination as Catarrhinides—a fact\r\nwhich they try to demonstrate on the alleged authority of the Coccyx\r\nappended to their Os Sacrum, that rudimentary tail which, if it were only\r\nlong enough, they would wag with joy and for ever, in honour of its\r\neminent discoverer. These will remain as faithful to their Ape‐ancestors\r\nas Christians will to tailless Adam. The Secret Doctrine, however, sets\r\nTheosophists and students of the Occult Sciences right on this point.\r\n\r\nIf we regard the second portion of the Third Race as the first\r\nrepresentatives of the _really human race_ with solid bones, then Hæckel’s\r\nsurmise that “the evolution of the primitive men took place ...in _either_\r\nSouthern Asia or ... Lemuria”—Africa, whether Eastern or Western being out\r\nof the question—is correct enough, if not entirely so. To be accurate,\r\nhowever, just as the evolution of the First Race, from the bodies of the\r\nPitris, took place on seven distinctly separated regions, at the Arctic\r\nPole of the (then) only Earth—so did the ultimate transformation of the\r\nThird occur. It began in those northern regions, which have just been\r\ndescribed as including Behring’s Straits, and what there then was of dry\r\nland in Central Asia, when the climate was semi‐tropical even in the\r\nArctic regions and excellently adapted to the primitive wants of nascent\r\nphysical man. That region, however, has been more than once frigid and\r\ntropical in turn since the appearance of man. The Commentary tells us that\r\nthe Third Race was only about the middle point of its development when:\r\n\r\n_The axle of the Wheel tilted. The Sun and Moon shone no longer over __\r\nthe heads of that portion of the Sweat‐born; people knew snow, ice, and\r\nfrost, and men, plants, and animals were dwarfed in their growth. Those\r\nthat did not perish remained as half‐grown babes_(_735_)_ in size and\r\nintellect. This was the third Pralaya of the Races._(736)\r\n\r\nThis means again, that our Globe is subject to seven periodical and\r\n_entire_ changes which go _pari passu_ with the Races. For the Secret\r\nDoctrine teaches that, during this Round, there must be seven terrestrial\r\nPralayas, occasioned by the change in the inclination of the Earth’s axis.\r\nIt is a Law which acts at its appointed time, and not at all blindly, as\r\nScience may think, but in strict accordance and harmony with Karmic Law.\r\nIn Occultism this Inexorable Law is referred to as the “Great Adjuster.”\r\nScience confesses its ignorance of the cause producing climatic\r\nvicissitudes and also the changes in the axial direction, which are always\r\nfollowed by these vicissitudes. In fact, it does not seem at all sure of\r\nthe axial changes. And being unable to account for them, it is prepared to\r\ndeny the axial phenomena altogether, rather than admit the intelligent\r\nhand of the Karmic Law which alone can reasonably explain these sudden\r\nchanges and their accompanying results. It has tried to account for them\r\nby various and more or less fantastic speculations; one of which, as de\r\nBoucheporn imagined, would be the sudden collision of our Earth with a\r\nComet, thus causing all the geological revolutions. But we prefer holding\r\nto our Esoteric explanation, since Fohat is as good as any Comet, and, in\r\naddition, has universal Intelligence to guide him.\r\n\r\nThus, since Vaivasvata Manu’s Humanity appeared on this Earth, there have\r\nalready been four such axial disturbances. The old Continents—save the\r\nfirst—were sucked in by the oceans, other lands appeared, and huge\r\nmountain chains arose where there had been none before. The face of the\r\nGlobe was completely changed each time; the “survival of the fittest”\r\nnations and races was secured through timely help; and the unfit ones—the\r\nfailures—were disposed of by being swept off the Earth. Such sorting and\r\nshifting does not happen between sunset and sunrise, as one may think, but\r\nrequires several thousands of years before the new house is set in order.\r\n\r\nThe sub‐races are also subject to the same cleansing process, and the\r\nside‐branchlets or family‐races as well. Let any one, well acquainted with\r\nastronomy and mathematics, throw a retrospective glance into the twilight\r\nand shadows of the Past. Let him observe and take notes of what he knows\r\nof the history of peoples and nations, and collate their respective rises\r\nand falls with what is known of astronomical cycles—especially with the\r\nSidereal Year, which is equal to 25,868 of our solar years.(737) Then, if\r\nthe observer is gifted with the faintest intuition, he will find how the\r\nweal and woe of nations are intimately connected with the beginning and\r\nclose of this Sidereal Cycle. True, the non‐occultist has the disadvantage\r\nthat he has no such far distant times to rely upon. He knows nothing,\r\nthrough exact Science, of what took place nearly 10,000 years ago; yet he\r\nmay find consolation in the knowledge of, or—if he so prefers—speculation\r\nabout, the fate of every one of the modern nations he knows of—some 16,000\r\nyears hence. Our meaning is very clear. Every Sidereal Year the tropics\r\nrecede from the pole _four degrees_ in each revolution from the\r\nequinoctial points, as the equator turns through the Zodiacal\r\nconstellations. Now, as every Astronomer knows, at present the tropic is\r\nonly twenty‐three degrees and a fraction less than half a degree from the\r\nequator. Hence it has still two and a half degrees to run before the end\r\nof the Sidereal Year. This gives humanity in general, and our civilized\r\nraces in particular, a reprieve of about 16,000 years.\r\n\r\nAfter the Great Flood of the Third Race (the Lemurians) as Commentary\r\nThirty‐three tells us:\r\n\r\n_Men decreased considerably in stature, and the duration of their lives\r\nwas diminished. Having fallen down in godliness they mixed with animal\r\nraces, and intermarried among giants and pigmies [the dwarfed races of the\r\nPoles].... Many acquired divine, nay more—unlawful knowledge, and followed\r\nwillingly the Left Path._\r\n\r\nThus were the Atlanteans approaching destruction in their turn. How many\r\ngeological periods it took to accomplish this _fourth_ destruction who can\r\ntell! But we are told that:\r\n\r\n44. THEY(738) BUILT GREAT IMAGES NINE YATIS HIGH,(739) THE SIZE OF THEIR\r\nBODIES (_a_). INNER FIRES HAD DESTROYED THE LAND OF THEIR FATHERS.(740)\r\nWATER THREATENED THE FOURTH(741) (_b_).\r\n\r\n(_a_) It is well worth noticing that most of the gigantic statues\r\ndiscovered on Easter Island, a portion of an undeniably submerged\r\ncontinent, as also those found on the outskirts of Gobi, a region which\r\nhad been submerged for untold ages, are all between twenty and thirty feet\r\nhigh. The statues found by Cook on Easter Island measured almost all\r\ntwenty‐seven feet in height, and eight feet across the shoulders.(742) The\r\nwriter is well aware that the modern Archæologists have decided that\r\n“these statues are not very old,” as declared by one of the high officials\r\nof the British Museum, where some of them now are. But this is one of\r\nthose arbitrary decisions of Modern Science which does not carry much\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nWe are told that after the destruction of Lemuria by subterranean fires\r\nmen went on steadily decreasing in stature—a process already commenced\r\nafter their _physical_ Fall—and that finally, some millions of years\r\nlater, they decreased to between six and seven feet, and are now, as in\r\nthe older Asiatic races, dwindling down to nearer five than six feet. As\r\nPickering shows, there is in the Malay race (a sub‐race of the Fourth\r\nRoot‐Race) a singular diversity of stature; the members of the Polynesian\r\nfamily, such as the Tahitians, Samoans, and Tonga islanders, are of a\r\n_higher stature than the rest of mankind_; but the Indian tribes and the\r\ninhabitants of the Indo‐Chinese countries are decidedly below the general\r\naverage. This is easily explained. The Polynesians belong to the very\r\nearliest of the surviving sub‐races, the others to the very latest and\r\nmost transitory stock. As the Tasmanians are now completely extinct, and\r\nthe Australians rapidly dying out, so will the other old races soon\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\n(_b_) How could those records have been preserved? we may be asked. Even\r\nthe knowledge of the Zodiac by the Hindûs is denied by our kind and\r\nlearned Orientalists, who conclude that the Âryan Hindûs knew nothing of\r\nit, before the Greeks brought it into the country. This uncalled‐for\r\nslander has been so sufficiently refuted by Bailly, and what is more, by\r\nthe clear _evidence of facts_, as not to need very much additional\r\nrefutation. While the Egyptian Zodiacs(743) preserve irrefutable proofs of\r\nrecords embracing more than three‐and‐a‐half Sidereal Years—or about\r\n87,000 years—the Hindû calculations cover nearly thirty‐three such years,\r\nor 850,000 years. The Egyptian priests assured Herodotus that the Pole of\r\nthe Earth and the Pole of the Ecliptic had formerly coincided. But, as\r\nremarked by the author of the _Sphinxiad_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    These _poor benighted_ Hindoos have registered a knowledge of\r\n    Astronomy for ten times 25,000 years since the [last local] Flood\r\n    [in Asia], or Age of Horror.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd they possess recorded observations from the date of the first Great\r\nFlood within the Âryan _historical_ memory—the Flood which submerged the\r\nlast portions of Atlantis 850,000 years ago. The Floods which preceded\r\nare, of course, more traditional than historical.\r\n\r\nThe sinking and transformation of Lemuria began nearly at the Arctic\r\nCircle (Norway), and the Third Race ended its career in Lankâ, or rather\r\non that which became Lankâ with the Atlanteans. The small remnant now\r\nknown as Ceylon is the Northern highland of ancient Lankâ, while the\r\nenormous Island of that name was, in the Lemurian period, the gigantic\r\nContinent already described. As a Master says:\r\n\r\n_Why should not your geologists bear in mind that under the continents\r\nexplored and fathomed by them ... there may be hidden, deep in the\r\nfathomless, or rather unfathomed ocean beds, other and far older\r\ncontinents whose strata have never been geologically explored; and that\r\nthey may some day upset entirely their present theories? Why not admit\r\nthat our present continents have, like Lemuria and Atlantis, been several\r\ntimes already submerged, and had the time to reäppear again, and bear\r\ntheir new groups of mankind and civilizations; and that at the first great\r\ngeological upheaval at the next cataclysm, in the series of periodical\r\ncataclysms that occur from the beginning to the end of every Round, our\r\nalready autopsized continents will go down, and the Lemurias and\r\nAtlantises come up again?_(744)\r\n\r\nNot identically the _same_ Continents, of course. But here an explanation\r\nis needed. No confusion need arise as regards the postulation of a\r\nNorthern Lemuria. The prolongation of that great Continent into the North\r\nAtlantic Ocean is in no way subversive of the opinions so widely held as\r\nto the site of the lost Atlantis, and one corroborates the other. It must\r\nbe noted that the Lemuria, which served as the cradle of the Third Root‐\r\nRace, not only embraced a vast area in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, but\r\nextended in the shape of a horse‐shoe past Madagascar, round “South\r\nAfrica” (then a mere fragment in process of formation), through the\r\nAtlantic up to Norway. The great English fresh‐water deposit called the\r\nWealden—which every Geologist regards as the mouth of a former great\r\nriver—is the bed of _the main stream which drained Northern Lemuria in the\r\nSecondary age_. The former actual existence of this river is a fact of\r\nScience—its votaries acknowledge the necessity of accepting the Secondary‐\r\nage Northern Lemuria, demanded by their data? Professor Berthold Seemann\r\nnot only accepted the reality of such a mighty continent, but regarded\r\nAustralia and Europe _as formerly portions of one continent_—thus\r\ncorroborating the whole “horse‐shoe” doctrine already enunciated. No more\r\nstriking confirmation of our position could be given, than the fact that\r\nthe _elevated ridge_ in the Atlantic basin, 9,000 feet in height, which\r\nruns for some two or three thousand miles southwards from a point near the\r\nBritish Islands, first slopes towards South America, then _shifts almost\r\nat right angles_ to proceed in a _south‐easterly_ line _toward the African\r\ncoast_, whence it runs on southward to Tristan d’Acunha. This ridge is a\r\nremnant of an Atlantic continent, and, could it be traced further, would\r\nestablish the reality of a submarine horse‐shoe junction with a former\r\ncontinent in the Indian Ocean.(745)\r\n\r\nThe _Atlantic portion of Lemuria_ was the geological basis of what is\r\ngenerally known as Atlantis, but which must be regarded rather as a\r\ndevelopment of the Atlantic prolongation of Lemuria than as an entirely\r\nnew mass of land upheaved to meet the special requirements of the Fourth\r\nRoot‐Race. Just as in the case of Race evolution, so in that of the\r\nshifting and re‐shifting of Continental masses, no hard and fast line can\r\nbe drawn as to where a new order ends and another begins. Continuity in\r\nnatural processes is never broken. Thus the Fourth‐Race Atlanteans were\r\ndeveloped from a nucleus of Northern Lemurian Third‐Race Men, centred,\r\nroughly speaking, toward a point of land in what is now the mid‐Atlantic\r\nOcean. Their Continent was formed by the coalescence of many islands and\r\npeninsulas which were upheaved in the ordinary course of time and\r\nultimately became the true home of the great Race known as the Atlanteans.\r\nAfter this consummation was once attained it follows, as stated on the\r\nhighest Occult authority, that:\r\n\r\n_Lemuria should no more be confounded with the Atlantis Continent, than\r\nEurope with America._(746)\r\n\r\nThe above, coming from quarters so discredited by orthodox Science, will,\r\nof course, be regarded as a more or less happy fiction. Even the clever\r\nwork of Donnelly, already mentioned, is put aside, notwithstanding that\r\nits statements are all confined within a frame of strictly scientific\r\nproofs. But we write for the future. New discoveries in this direction\r\nwill vindicate the claim of the Asiatic Philosophers, that\r\nsciences—Geology, Ethnology, and History included—were pursued by the\r\nAntediluvian nations who lived untold ages ago. Future “finds” will\r\njustify the correctness of the present observations of such acute minds as\r\nH. A. Taine and Renan. The former shows that the civilizations of such\r\narchaic nations as the Egyptians, Âryans of India, Chaldæans, Chinese, and\r\nAssyrians are the result of preceding civilizations lasting “_myriads_ of\r\ncenturies”;(747) and the latter points to the fact that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Egypt at the beginning appears mature, old, and entirely without\r\n    mythical and heroic ages, as if the country had never known youth.\r\n    Its civilization has no infancy, and its art no archaic period.\r\n    The civilization of the Old Monarchy did not begin with infancy.\r\n    It was already mature.(748)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this Professor R. Owen adds that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Egypt is recorded to have been a civilized and governed community\r\n    _before_ the time of Menes.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd Winchell states that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    At the epoch of Menes the Egyptians were already a civilized and\r\n    numerous people. Manetho tells us that Athotis, the son of this\r\n    first king Menes, built the palace of Memphis; that he was a\r\n    physician, and left _anatomical books_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is quite natural if we are to believe the statement of Herodotus, who\r\nrecords in Euterpe (cxlii), that the written history of the Egyptian\r\npriests dated from about 12,000 years before his time. But what are 12,000\r\nor even 120,000 years compared with the millions of years which have\r\nelapsed since the Lemurian period? The latter, however, has not been left\r\nwithout witnesses, notwithstanding its tremendous antiquity. The complete\r\nrecords of the growth, development, social and even political life of the\r\nLemurians, have been preserved in the Secret Annals. Unfortunately, few\r\nare those who can read them; and those who could would still be unable to\r\nunderstand the language, unless acquainted with all the seven keys of its\r\nsymbolism. For the comprehension of the Occult Doctrine is based on that\r\nof the Seven Sciences; and these Sciences find their expression in the\r\nseven different applications of the Secret Records to the exoteric texts.\r\nThus we have to deal with modes of thought on seven entirely different\r\nplanes of Ideality. Every text relates to, and has to be rendered from,\r\none of the following standpoints:\r\n\r\n1. The Realistic Plane of Thought.\r\n\r\n2. The Idealistic.\r\n\r\n3. The purely Divine or Spiritual.\r\n\r\nThe other planes too far transcend the average consciousness, especially\r\nof the materialistic mind, to admit of their being even symbolized in\r\nterms of ordinary phraseology. There is no purely _mythical_ element in\r\nany of the ancient religious texts; but the mode of thought in which they\r\nwere originally written has to be found out and closely adhered to during\r\nthe process of interpretation. For it is symbolical, the archaic mode of\r\nthought; emblematical, a later though very ancient mode of thought;\r\nparabolical or allegorical; hieroglyphical; or again logogrammical, the\r\nmost difficult method of all; every letter, as in the Chinese language,\r\nrepresenting a whole word. Thus, almost every proper name, whether in the\r\n_Vedas_, the _Book of the Dead_, or, to a certain degree, in the _Bible_,\r\nis composed of such logograms. No one not initiated into the mystery of\r\nthe Occult religious logography can presume to know what a name in any\r\nancient fragment means, before he has mastered the meaning of every letter\r\nthat composes it. How is it to be expected that the merely profane\r\nthinker, however great may be his erudition in orthodox symbolism, so to\r\nsay—_i.e._, in that symbolism which can never get out of the old grooves\r\nof solar myth and sexual worship—how is it to be expected that the profane\r\nscholar should penetrate into the arcana behind the veil? One who deals\r\nwith the husk or shell of the dead‐letter, and devotes himself to the\r\nkaleidoscopic transformation of barren word‐symbols, can never expect to\r\nget beyond the vagaries of modern Mythologists.\r\n\r\nThus, Vaivasvata, Xisuthrus, Deucalion, Noah, etc.,—all the head‐figures\r\nof the World‐Deluges, universal and partial, astronomical or\r\ngeological—all furnish in their very names the records of the causes and\r\neffects which led to the event, if one can but read them fully. All such\r\nDeluges are based on events that took place in Nature, and stand as\r\n_historical_ records, therefore—whether they were sidereal, geological, or\r\neven simply allegorical—of a moral event on other and higher planes of\r\nbeing. This we believe has now been sufficiently demonstrated during the\r\nlong explanation necessitated by the allegorical Stanzas.\r\n\r\nTo speak of a race nine “yatis,” or twenty‐seven feet, high, in a work\r\nclaiming a more scientific character than, let us say, the story of “Jack\r\nthe Giant‐Killer,” is a somewhat unusual proceeding. Where are your\r\nproofs?—the writer will be asked. In history and tradition, is the answer.\r\nTraditions about a race of giants in days of old are universal; they exist\r\nin oral and written lore. India had her Dânavas and Daityas; Ceylon had\r\nher Râkshasas; Greece, her Titans; Egypt, her colossal Heroes; Chaldæa,\r\nher Izdubars (Nimrod); and the Jews their Emims of the land of Moab, with\r\nthe famous giants, Anakim.(749) Moses speaks of Og, a king whose\r\n“bedstead” was nine cubits long (15ft. 4in.) and four wide,(750) and\r\nGoliath was “six cubits and a span in height” (or 10ft. 7in.). The only\r\ndifference found between “revealed scripture” and the evidence furnished\r\nto us by Herodotus, Diodorus Siculus, Homer, Pliny, Plutarch,\r\nPhilostratus, etc., is this: While the Pagans mention only the _skeletons\r\nof giants_, dead untold ages before, relics that some of them _had\r\npersonally seen_, the _Bible_ interpreters unblushingly demand that\r\nGeology and Archæology should believe, that several countries were\r\ninhabited by such giants in the day of Moses; giants before whom the Jews\r\nwere as grasshoppers, and who still existed in the days of Joshua and\r\nDavid. Unfortunately their own chronology is in the way. Either the latter\r\nor the giants has to be given up.\r\n\r\nOf yet standing witnesses to the submerged Continents, and the colossal\r\nmen that inhabited them, there are still a few. Archæology claims several\r\nsuch on this Earth, though beyond wondering “what these may be”—it has\r\nnever made any serious attempt to solve the mystery. Not to speak of the\r\nEaster Island statues already mentioned, to what epoch belong the colossal\r\nstatues, still erect and intact near Bamian? Archæology, as usual, assigns\r\nthem to the first centuries of Christianity, and errs in this as it does\r\nin many other speculations. A few words of description will show the\r\nreaders what are the statues of both Easter Isle and Bamian. We will first\r\nexamine what is known of them to orthodox Science.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Teapi, Rapa‐nui, or Easter Island, is an isolated spot almost\r\n    2,000 miles from the South American coast.... In length it is\r\n    about twelve miles, in breadth four ... and there is an extinct\r\n    crater 1,050 feet high in its centre. The island abounds in\r\n    craters, which have been extinct for so long that no tradition of\r\n    their activity remains.(751)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut who made the great stone images(752) which are now the chief\r\nattraction of the island to visitors? “_No one knows_,” says a reviewer.\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is more than likely that they were here when the present\r\n    inhabitants [a handful of Polynesian savages] arrived.... Their\r\n    workmanship _is of a high order_, ... and it is believed that the\r\n    race who formed them were the frequenters of the natives of Peru\r\n    and other portions of South America.... Even at the date of Cook’s\r\n    visit, some of the statues, measuring twenty‐seven feet in height\r\n    and eight across the shoulders, were lying overthrown, while\r\n    others still standing appeared much larger. One of the latter was\r\n    so lofty that the shade was sufficient to shelter a party of\r\n    thirty persons from the heat of the sun. The platforms on which\r\n    these colossal images stood averaged from thirty to forty feet in\r\n    length, twelve to sixteen broad ... all built of hewn stone in the\r\n    Cyclopean style, very much like the walls of the Temple of\r\n    Pachacamac, _or the ruins of Tia‐Huanaco in Peru_.(753)\r\n\r\n\r\n“_There is no reason to believe that any of the statues have been built\r\nup, bit by bit, by scaffolding erected around them_,” adds the reviewer\r\nvery suggestively—without explaining _how_ they could be built otherwise,\r\nunless made by giants of the same size as the statues themselves. Two of\r\nthe best of these colossal images are now in the British Museum. The\r\nimages at Ronororaka are four in number, three deeply sunk in the soil,\r\nand one resting on the back of its head like a man asleep. Their types,\r\nthough all are long‐headed, are different; and they are evidently meant\r\nfor portraits, as the noses, the mouths, and chins differ greatly in form;\r\ntheir head‐dress, moreover—a kind of flat cap with a piece attached to it\r\nto cover the back portion of the head—shows that the originals were no\r\nsavages of the stone period. Verily the question may be asked, Who made\r\nthem?—but it is not Archæology nor yet Geology that is likely to answer,\r\neven though the latter recognizes in the island a portion of a submerged\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nBut who cut the Bamian, still more colossal, statues, the tallest and the\r\nmost gigantic in the whole world?—for Bartholdi’s “Statue of Liberty,” now\r\nat New York, _is a dwarf_ when compared with the largest of the five\r\nimages. Burnes, and several learned Jesuits who have visited the place,\r\nspeak of a mountain “all honeycombed with gigantic cells,” with two\r\nimmense giants cut in the same rock. They are referred to as the modern\r\nMiaotse (_vide supra_, quotation from _Shoo‐King_), the last surviving\r\nwitnesses of the Miaotse who had “troubled the earth”; the Jesuits are\r\nright, and the Archæologists, who see Buddhas in the largest of these\r\nstatues, are mistaken. For all those numberless gigantic ruins which are\r\ndiscovered one after the other in our day, all those immense avenues of\r\ncolossal ruins that cross North America along and beyond the Rocky\r\nMountains, are the work of the Cyclopes, the true and actual Giants of\r\nold. “Masses of enormous human bones” were found “in America, near Munte\r\n[?]” a celebrated modern traveller tells us, precisely on the spot which\r\nlocal tradition points out as the landing spot of those giants who overran\r\nAmerica when it had hardly arisen from the waters.(754)\r\n\r\nCentral Asian traditions say the same of the Bamian statues. What are\r\nthey, and what is the place where they have stood for countless ages,\r\ndefying the cataclysms around them, and even the hand of man, as in the\r\ninstance of the hordes of Timoor and the Vandal‐warriors of Nadir Shah?\r\nBamian is a small, miserable, half‐ruined town in Central Asia, half‐way\r\nbetween Cabul and Balkh, at the foot of Koh‐i‐baba, a huge mountain of the\r\nParopamisian, or Hindu‐Kush, Chain, some 8,500 feet above the level of the\r\nsea. In days of old, Bamian was a portion of the ancient city of\r\nDjooljool, ruined and destroyed to the last stone by Tchengis‐Khan in the\r\nthirteenth century. The whole valley is hemmed in by colossal rocks, which\r\nare full of partially natural and partially artificial caves and grottoes,\r\nonce the dwellings of Buddhist monks who had established in them their\r\nVihâras. Such Vihâras are to be met with in profusion, to this day, in the\r\nrock‐cut temples of India and the valleys of Jellalabad. In front of some\r\nof these caves five enormous statues—of what is regarded as Buddha—have\r\nbeen discovered or rather _rediscovered_ in our century, for the famous\r\nChinese traveller Hiouen Thsang speaks of having seen them, when he\r\nvisited Bamian in the seventh century.\r\n\r\nThe contention that no larger statues exist on the whole globe, is easily\r\nproven on the evidence of all the travellers who have examined them and\r\ntaken their measurements. Thus, the largest is 173 feet high, or _seventy_\r\nfeet higher than the “Statue of Liberty” now at New York, as the latter is\r\nonly 105 feet or 34 mètres high. The famous Colossus of Rhodes itself,\r\nbetween whose legs the largest vessels of those days passed with ease,\r\nmeasured only 120 to 130 feet in height. The second largest statue, which\r\nis also cut out in the rock like the first, is only 120 feet or fifteen\r\nfeet taller than the said “Liberty.”(755) The third statue is only 60 feet\r\nhigh, the two others still smaller, the last being only a little larger\r\nthan the average tall man of our present Race. The first and largest of\r\nthe colossi represents a man draped in a kind of “toga”; M. de Nadeylac\r\nthinks that the general appearance of the figure, the lines of the head,\r\nthe drapery, and especially the large hanging ears, are undeniable\r\nindications that Buddha was meant to be represented. But they really prove\r\nnothing. Notwithstanding the fact that most of the now existing figures of\r\nBuddha, represented in the posture of Samâdhi, have large drooping ears,\r\nthis is a later innovation and an afterthought. The primitive idea was due\r\nto Esoteric allegory. The unnaturally large ears symbolize the omniscience\r\nof wisdom, and were meant as a reminder of the power of Him who _knows and\r\nhears all_, and whose benevolent love and attention for all creatures\r\nnothing can escape. As a Shloka says:\r\n\r\n_The merciful Lord, our Master, hears the cry of agony of the smallest of\r\nthe small, beyond vale and mountain, and hastens to its deliverance._\r\n\r\nGautama Buddha was an Âryan Hindû, and an approach to such ears is found\r\nonly among the Mongolian Burmese and Siamese, who, as in Cochin, distort\r\ntheir ears artificially. The Buddhist monks, who turned the grottoes of\r\nthe Miao‐tse into Vihâras and cells, came into Central Asia about or in\r\nthe first century of the Christian era. Therefore, Hiouen Thsang, speaking\r\nof the colossal statue, says that “the shining of the gold ornamentation\r\nthat overlaid the statue” in his day “dazzled one’s eyes,” but of such\r\ngilding there remains not a vestige in modern times. The drapery, in\r\ncontrast to the figure itself, which is cut out of the standing rock, is\r\nmade of plaster and modelled over the stone image. Talbot, who has made\r\nthe most careful examination, found that this drapery belonged to a far\r\nlater epoch. The statue itself has therefore to be assigned to a far\r\nearlier period than Buddhism. In such case, it may be asked, Whom does it\r\nrepresent?\r\n\r\nOnce more tradition, corroborated by written records, answers the query,\r\nand explains the mystery. The Buddhist Arhats and Ascetics found the five\r\nstatues, and many more, now crumbled down to dust. Three of them standing\r\nin colossal niches at the entrance of their future abode, they covered\r\nwith plaster, and, over the old, modelled new statues made to represent\r\nLord Tathâgata. The interior walls of the niches are covered to this day\r\nwith bright paintings of human figures, and the sacred image of Buddha is\r\nrepeated in every group. These frescoes and ornaments—which remind one of\r\nthe Byzantine style of painting—are all due to the piety of the monk‐\r\nascetics, as also are some other minor figures and rock‐cut\r\nornamentations. But the five statues belong to the handiwork of the\r\nInitiates of the Fourth Race, who, after the submersion of their\r\nContinent, sought refuge in the fastnesses and on the summits of the\r\nCentral Asian mountain chains. Thus, the five statues are an imperishable\r\nrecord of the Esoteric Teaching as to the gradual evolution of the Races.\r\n\r\nThe largest is made to represent the First Race of mankind, its ethereal\r\nbody being commemorated in hard, everlasting stone, for the instruction of\r\nfuture generations, as its remembrance would otherwise never have survived\r\nthe Atlantean Deluge. The second—120 feet high—represents the Sweat‐born;\r\nand the third—measuring 60 feet—immortalizes the Race that fell, and\r\nthereby inaugurated the first _physical_ Race, born of father and mother,\r\nthe last descendants of which are represented in the statues found on\r\nEaster Isle. These were only from 20 to 25 feet in stature at the epoch\r\nwhen Lemuria was submerged, after it had been nearly destroyed by volcanic\r\nfires. The Fourth Race was still smaller, though gigantic in comparison\r\nwith our present Fifth Race, and the series culminated finally in the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nThese are, then, the “Giants” of antiquity, the ante‐ and post‐diluvian\r\nGibborim of the _Bible_. They lived and flourished one million years ago\r\nrather than between three and four thousand only. The Anakim of Joshua,\r\nwhose hosts were as “grasshoppers” in comparison with the Jews, are thus a\r\npiece of Israelite fancy, unless indeed the people of Israel claim for\r\nJoshua an antiquity and origin in the Eocene, or at any rate in the\r\nMiocene age, and change the millenniums of their chronology into millions\r\nof years.\r\n\r\nIn everything that pertains to prehistoric times the reader ought to bear\r\nin mind the wise words of Montaigne. Saith the great French Philosopher:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is a sottish presumption to disdaine and condemne that for\r\n    false, which unto us seemeth to beare no show of likelihood or\r\n    truth: which is an ordinarie fault in those who perswade\r\n    themselves to be of more sufficiencie than the vulgar sort....\r\n\r\n    But reason hath taught me, that so resolutely to condemne a thing\r\n    for false and impossible, is to assume unto himself the advantage\r\n    to have the bounds and limits of God’s will, and the power of our\r\n    common mother Nature tied to his sleeve, and that there is no\r\n    greater folly in the world than to reduce them to the measure of\r\n    our capacitie and bounds of our sufficiencie....\r\n\r\n    If we term those things monsters or miracles to which our reason\r\n    cannot attain, how many such doe daily present themselves unto our\r\n    sight? Let us consider through what cloudes, and how blinde‐folde,\r\n    we are led to the knowledge of most things that passe our hands;\r\n    verily we shall finde it is rather custome than science that\r\n    receiveth the strangenesse of them from us: and that those things,\r\n    were they newly presented unto us, wee should doubtless deeme them\r\n    as much or more unlikely and incredible than any other.(756)\r\n\r\n\r\nA fair‐minded scholar, before denying the possibility of _our_ history and\r\nrecords, should search modern history, as well as the universal traditions\r\nscattered throughout ancient and modern literature, for traces left by\r\nthese marvellous early races. Few among the unbelievers suspect the wealth\r\nof corroborative evidence which is to be found scattered about and buried,\r\neven in the British Museum alone. The reader is asked to throw one more\r\nglance at the subject‐matter treated of in the Section which follows.\r\n\r\n\r\nCyclopean Ruins And Colossal Stones As Witnesses To Giants.\r\n\r\n\r\nDe Mirville, in his enormous works, “Mémoires Adressées aux Académies,”\r\ncarrying out the task of proving the reality of the Devil and showing his\r\nabode in every ancient and modern idol, has collected several hundred\r\npages of “historical evidence” that, in the days of “miracle,” both pagan\r\nand biblical, stones walked, spoke, delivered oracles, and even sang. That\r\nfinally, the “Christ‐stone,” or Christ‐rock, “the spiritual Rock” that\r\nfollowed Israel,(757) “became a Jupiter‐lapis,” swallowed by his father\r\nSaturn, “under the shape of a stone.”(758) We will not stop to discuss the\r\nevident misuse and materialization of biblical metaphors simply for the\r\nsake of proving the “Satanism” of idols, though a good deal might be\r\nsaid(759) on this subject. But without claiming any such peripateticism\r\nand innate psychic faculties for our stones, we may collect, in our turn,\r\nevery available evidence to hand, to show that: (_a_) had there been no\r\ngiants to move such colossal rocks, there could never have been a\r\nStonehenge, a Carnac (Brittany), or other such Cyclopean structures; and\r\n(_b_) were there no such thing as Magic, there could never have been so\r\nmany witnesses to “oracular” and “speaking” stones.\r\n\r\nIn the _Achaica_ we find Pausanias confessing that, in beginning his work,\r\nhe had regarded the Greeks as mighty _stupid_ “for worshipping stones.”\r\nBut, having reached Arcadia, he adds: “I have changed my way of\r\nthinking.”(760) Therefore, without worshipping stones or stone idols and\r\nstatues, which is the same thing—a crime with which Roman Catholics are\r\nunwise to reproach Pagans, as they do—one may be allowed to believe in\r\nwhat so many great Philosophers and holy men have believed in, without\r\ndeserving to be called an “idiot” by modern Pausaniuses.\r\n\r\nThe reader is referred to the _Académie des Inscriptions_, if he would\r\nstudy the various properties of flints and pebbles from the standpoint of\r\nmagic and psychic powers. In a poem on “Stones” attributed to Orpheus,\r\nthese stones are divided into Ophites and Sideritês, the “Serpent‐stone”\r\nand “Star‐stone.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Ophitês is shaggy, hard, heavy, black, and has _the gift of\r\n    speech_; when one prepares to cast it away, it produces a sound\r\n    _similar to the cry of a child_. It is by means of this stone that\r\n    Helenus foretold the ruin of Troy, his fatherland.(761)\r\n\r\n\r\nSanchuniathon and Philo Byblus, in referring to these “bétyles,” call them\r\n“_animated_ stones.” Photius repeats what Damascius, Asclepiades, Isidorus\r\nand the physician Eusebius had asserted before him. Eusebius especially\r\nnever parted with his Ophitês, which he carried in his bosom, and received\r\noracles from it, delivered _in a small voice resembling a low\r\nwhistling_.(762) Arnobius, a holy man, who “from a Pagan had become one of\r\nthe _lights of the Church_,” as Christians tell their readers, confesses\r\nhe could never meet with one of such stones without putting it a question,\r\n“which it answered occasionally in a _clear and sharp small voice_.”\r\nWhere, then, is the difference between the Christian and the Pagan\r\nOphitês, we ask?\r\n\r\nThe famous stone at Westminster was called _liafail_, “the speaking\r\nstone,” and raised its voice only to name the king that had to be chosen.\r\nCambry, in his _Monuments Celtiques_, says he saw it when it still bore\r\nthe inscription:(763)\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Ni fallat fatum, Scoti quocumque locatum_\r\n    _Invenient lapidem, regnasse tenentur ibidem_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, Suidas speaks of a certain Heræscus, who could distinguish at a\r\nglance the inanimate stones from those which were endowed with motion; and\r\nPliny mentions stones which “ran away when a hand approached them.”(764)\r\n\r\nDe Mirville—who seeks to justify the _Bible_—enquires very pertinently,\r\nwhy the monstrous stones of Stonehenge were called in days of old _chior‐\r\ngaur_ or the “dance of giants” (from _côr_, “dance,” whence _chorea_, and\r\n_gaur_, “giant”)? And then he sends the reader to receive his reply from\r\nthe Bishop St. Gildas. But the authors of such works as _Voyage dans le\r\nComté de Cornouailles, sur les Traces des Géants_, and of various learned\r\nworks on the ruins of Stonehenge,(765) Carnac, and West Hoadley, give far\r\nfuller and more reliable information upon this particular subject. In\r\nthose regions—true forests of rocks—immense monoliths are found, “some\r\nweighing over 500,000 kilograms.” These “hanging stones” of Salisbury\r\nPlain are believed to be the remains of a Druidical temple. But the Druids\r\nwere historical men and not Cyclopes, or giants. Who then, _if not\r\ngiants_, could ever raise such masses—especially those at Carnac and West\r\nHoadley—range them in such symmetrical order that they should represent\r\nthe planisphere, and place them in such wonderful equipoise that they seem\r\nto hardly touch the ground, and though set in motion at the slightest\r\ntouch of the finger, would nevertheless resist the efforts of twenty men\r\nshould they attempt to displace them.\r\n\r\nNow if we say that most of these stones are relics of the last Atlanteans,\r\nwe shall be answered that all the Geologists claim them to be of a natural\r\norigin; that, a rock when “weathering”—_i.e._, losing flake after flake of\r\nits substance under the influence of the weather—assumes this form; that,\r\nthe “tors” in West England exhibit curious forms, also produced by this\r\ncause. And thus since all Scientists consider the “rocking stones to be of\r\npurely natural origin, wind, rain, etc., causing disintegration of rocks\r\nin layers”—our statement will be justly denied, especially as “we see this\r\nprocess of rock‐modification in progress around us to‐day.” Let us then\r\nexamine the case.\r\n\r\nFirst read what Geology has to say, and you will then learn that often\r\nthese gigantic masses are entire strangers in the countries wherein they\r\nare now fixed; that their geological congeners often pertain to strata\r\nunknown in those countries and which are only to be found far beyond the\r\nseas. Mr. William Tooke, in speculating upon the enormous blocks of\r\ngranite which are strewn over Southern Russia and Siberia, tells the\r\nreader that where they now rest, there are neither rocks nor mountains;\r\nand that they must have been brought over “from immense distances and with\r\nprodigious efforts.”(766) Charton speaks of a specimen of such rock from\r\nIreland, which had been submitted to the analysis of an eminent English\r\nGeologist, who assigned to it a foreign origin “_perhaps even\r\nAfrican_.”(767)\r\n\r\nThis is a strange _coincidence_, for Irish tradition attributes the origin\r\nof her circular stones to a _Sorcerer who brought them from Africa_. De\r\nMirville sees in this Sorcerer “an accursed Hamite.”(768) We see in him a\r\ndark Atlantean, or perhaps even some earlier Lemurian, who had survived\r\ntill the birth of the British Islands—a giant in any and every case.(769)\r\nSays Cambry, naively:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Men have nothing to do with it ... for never could _human_ power\r\n    and industry undertake anything of this kind. Nature alone has\r\n    accomplished it all [!!] and Science will demonstrate it some day\r\n    [!!].(770)\r\n\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it was _human_, though gigantic power, which accomplished\r\nit, and no more “Nature” alone than God or Devil.\r\n\r\n“Science,” having undertaken to demonstrate that even the Mind and Spirit\r\nof man are simply the production of “blind forces,” is quite capable of\r\naccepting the task, and it may be that she will come out some fine\r\nmorning, and seek to prove that Nature alone has marshalled the gigantic\r\nrocks of Stonehenge, traced their position with mathematical precision,\r\ngiven them the form of the Dendera planisphere and of the signs of the\r\nZodiac, and brought stones weighing over one million of pounds from Africa\r\nand Asia to England and Ireland!\r\n\r\nIt is true that Cambry recanted later on, when saying:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I believed for a long time in _Nature_, but I _recant_, ... for\r\n    chance _is unable to create_ such marvellous combinations, ... and\r\n    those who placed the said rocks in equipoise, are the same who\r\n    have raised the moving masses of the pond of Huelgoat, near\r\n    Concarneau.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. John Watson, quoted by the same author, when speaking of the _moving_\r\nrocks, or “rocking stones” situated on the slope of Golcar (the\r\n“Enchanter”) says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The astonishing movement of those masses poised in equilibrium\r\n    made the Celts compare them to Gods.(771)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn _Stonehenge_, by Flinders Petrie, it is said that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Stonehenge is built of the stone of the district, a red sandstone,\r\n    or “sarsen” stone, locally called “grey wethers.” But some of the\r\n    stones, especially those which are said to have been devoted to\r\n    astronomical purposes, have been brought from a distance, probably\r\n    the North of Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo close, the reflections of a man of Science, in an article upon the\r\nsubject published in 1850 in the _Revue Archéologique_, are worthy of\r\nbeing quoted:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Every stone is a block whose weight would try the most powerful\r\n    machines. There are, in a word, scattered throughout the globe,\r\n    masses, before which the word _materials_ seems to remain\r\n    inexplicable, at the sight of which imagination is confounded, and\r\n    that had to be endowed with a name as colossal as the things\r\n    themselves. Besides which, these _immense rocking_ stones, called\r\n    sometimes _routers_, placed upright on one of their sides as on a\r\n    point, their equipoise being so perfect that the slightest touch\r\n    is sufficient to set them in motion ... betray a most positive\r\n    knowledge of statics. Reciprocal counter‐motion, surfaces, plane,\r\n    convex and concave, in turn ... all this allies them to Cyclopean\r\n    monuments, of which it can be said with good reason, repeating De\r\n    la Vega, that “the demons seem to have worked on them more than\r\n    men.”(772)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor once we agree with our friends and foes, the Roman Catholics, and ask\r\nwhether such prodigies of statics and equilibrium, with masses weighing\r\nmillions of pounds, can be the work of Palæolithic _savages_, of cave‐men,\r\ntaller than the average man in our century, yet ordinary mortals as we\r\nare? It is not our purpose to refer to the various traditions attached to\r\nthe rocking stones. Still, it may be as well to remind the English reader\r\nof Giraldus Cambrensis, who speaks of such a stone on the Isle of Mona,\r\nwhich returned to its place, notwithstanding every effort to keep it\r\nelsewhere. At the time of the conquest of Ireland by Henry II, a Count\r\nHugo Cestrensis, desiring to convince himself of the reality of the fact,\r\ntied the Mona stone to a far larger one and had them thrown into the sea.\r\nOn the following morning it was found in its accustomed place. The learned\r\nWilliam of Salisbury warrants the fact by testifying to its presence in\r\nthe wall of a church where he had seen it in 1554. And this reminds one of\r\nwhat Pliny said of the stone left by the Argonauts at Cyzicum, which the\r\nCyzicans had placed in the Prytaneum, “whence it _ran away several times_,\r\nand so they were forced to weight it with lead.”(773) Here we have immense\r\nstones stated by all antiquity to be “living, moving, speaking, and self‐\r\nperambulating.” They were also capable, it seems, of making people run\r\naway, since they were called _routers_, from the word to “rout,” or “put\r\nto flight”; and Des Mousseaux shows them all to be prophetic stones, and\r\nsometimes called “_mad_ stones.”(774)\r\n\r\nThe rocking stone is accepted by Science. But why did it rock? One must be\r\nblind not to see that this motion was one more means of divination, and\r\nthat they were called for this very reason the “stones of truth.”(775)\r\n\r\n_This is history_, the past of prehistoric times warranting the same in\r\nlater ages. The Dracontia, sacred to the Moon and the Serpent, were the\r\nmore ancient “rocks of destiny” of older nations; and their motion, or\r\n_rocking_, was a code perfectly clear to the initiated priests, who alone\r\nhad the key to this ancient _reading_. Vormius and Olaus Magnus show that\r\nit was according to the orders of the oracle, whose voice spoke through\r\n“these immense rocks raised by the colossal powers of [ancient] giants,”\r\nthat the kings of Scandinavia were elected. Says Pliny:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In India and Persia it is she (the Persian Otizoë) whom the Magi\r\n    had to consult for the election of their sovereigns;(776)\r\n\r\n\r\nand he further describes a rock overshadowing Harpasa, in Asia, and placed\r\nin such a manner that “a single finger can move it, while the weight of\r\nthe whole body makes it resist.”(777) Why then should not the rocking\r\nstones of Ireland, or those of Brimham, in Yorkshire, have served for the\r\nsame mode of _divination_ or oracular communications? The hugest of them\r\nare evidently the relics of the Atlanteans; the smaller, such as Brimham\r\nRocks, with revolving stones on their summit, are copies from the more\r\nancient lithoi. Had not the Bishops of the Middle Ages destroyed all the\r\nplans of the Dracontia they could lay their hands on, Science would know\r\nmore of these.(778) As it is, we know that they were universally used\r\nduring long prehistoric ages, and all for the same purposes of prophecy\r\nand _magic_. É. Biot, a member of the Institute of France, published in\r\nthe _Antiquités de France_ (vol. ix), an article showing the Chatampéramba\r\n(the “Field of Death,” or ancient burial ground in Malabar), to be\r\nidentical in situation with the old tombs at Carnac; that is to say, “a\r\nprominence and a central tomb.” Bones are found in the tombs, and Mr.\r\nHalliwell tells us that some of these are enormous, the natives calling\r\nthe tombs the “dwellings of the Râkshasas” or giants. Several stone\r\ncircles, “considered the work of the Panch Pândava (five Pândus), as all\r\nsuch monuments are in India, where they are to be found in such great\r\nnumbers,” when opened by the direction of Rajah Vasariddi, “were found to\r\ncontain _human bones of a very large size_.”(779)\r\n\r\nAgain, De Mirville is right in his _generalization_, if not in his\r\nconclusions. As the long cherished theory that the Dracontia are mostly\r\nwitnesses to “great natural geological commotions” (Charton), and “the\r\nwork of Nature” (Cambry), is now exploded, his remarks are very just:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We advise Science to reflect .... and, above all, no longer to\r\n    class Titans and Giants among primitive legends; for their works\r\n    are there, under our eyes, and those rocking masses will oscillate\r\n    on their basis to the end of the world to help them to realize\r\n    once for all, that one is not altogether a candidate for Charenton\r\n    for believing in wonders certified to by the whole of\r\n    Antiquity.(780)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is just what we can never repeat too often, though it may be that the\r\nvoices of both Occultists and Roman Catholics are raised in the desert.\r\nNevertheless, no one can fail to see that Science is as inconsistent, to\r\nsay the least, in its modern speculations, as was ancient and mediæval\r\nTheology in _its_ interpretations of the so‐called _Revelation_. Science\r\nwould have men descend from the pithecoid ape—a transformation requiring\r\nmillions of years—and yet fears to make Mankind older than 100,000 years!\r\nScience teaches the gradual transformation of species, natural selection\r\nand evolution from the lowest form to the highest, from mollusc to fish,\r\nfrom reptile to bird and mammalian—yet it refuses to man, who is\r\nphysiologically only a higher mammal and animal, such a transformation of\r\nhis external form. But if the monstrous Iguanodon of the Wealden may have\r\nbeen the ancestor of the diminutive Iguana of to‐day, why could not the\r\nmonstrous man of the Secret Doctrine have become the modern man—the link\r\nbetween Animal and Angel? Is there anything more unscientific in this\r\n“theory” than in that of refusing to man a spiritual immortal Ego, making\r\nof him an automaton, and ranking him, at the same time, _as a distinct\r\ngenus_ in the system of Nature? Occult Sciences may be less scientific\r\nthan the present Exact Sciences, they are nevertheless more logical and\r\nconsistent in their teachings. Physical forces, and the natural affinities\r\nof atoms may be sufficient as factors to transform a plant into an animal;\r\nbut it requires more than the mere interplay between certain material\r\naggregates and their environment, to call to life a _fully conscious man_,\r\neven though he were no more indeed than a ramification between two “poor\r\ncousins” of the quadrumanous order. Occult Sciences admit with Hæckel that\r\n(objective) Life on our Globe “is a logical postulate of scientific\r\nnatural history,” but add that the rejection of a like _spiritual_\r\ninvolution, from _within without_, of invisible subjective Spirit‐\r\nLife—Eternal and a Principle in Nature—is more illogical, if possible,\r\nthan to say that the Universe and all in it has been gradually built by\r\n“blind forces” inherent in Matter, without any _external_ help.\r\n\r\nSuppose an Occultist were to claim that the first grand organ of a\r\ncathedral had come originally into being as follows: first, there was a\r\nprogressive and gradual elaboration in space of an organizable material,\r\nwhich resulted in the production of a state of matter named _organic\r\nprotein_; then, under the influence of incident forces, these states\r\nhaving been thrown into a phase of unstable equilibrium, they slowly and\r\nmajestically evolved into new combinations of carved and polished wood, of\r\nbrass pins and staples, of leather and ivory, wind‐pipes and bellows;\r\nafter which, having adapted all its parts into one harmonious and\r\nsymmetrical machine, the organ suddenly pealed forth Mozart’s “Requiem”;\r\nthis was followed by a Sonata of Beethoven, etc., _ad infinitum_, its keys\r\nplaying of themselves and the wind blowing into the pipes by its own\r\ninherent force and fancy. What would Science say to such a theory? Yet, it\r\nis precisely in such wise that the materialistic _savants_ tell us that\r\nthe Universe was formed, with its millions of beings, and man, its\r\nspiritual crown.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the real inner thought of Mr. Herbert Spencer, when\r\nwriting on the subject of the gradual transformation of species, his words\r\napply to our doctrine.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Construed in terms of evolution, every kind of being is conceived\r\n    as a product of modifications wrought by insensible gradations _on\r\n    a preëxisting kind of being_.(781)\r\n\r\n\r\nThen why, in this case, should not historical man be the product of a\r\nmodification on a preëxistent and prehistorical kind of man, even\r\nsupposing for argument’s sake that there is _nothing_ within him to last\r\nlonger than, or live independently of, his physical structure? But this is\r\nnot so! For, when we are told that “organic matters are produced in the\r\nlaboratory by what we may literally call _artificial evolution_”(782)—we\r\nanswer the distinguished English philosopher, that Alchemists and great\r\nAdepts did as much, and, indeed, far more, before the Chemists ever\r\nattempted to “build out of dissociated elements complex combinations.” The\r\nHomunculi of Paracelsus are a fact in Alchemy, and will become one in\r\nChemistry very likely, and then Mrs. Shelley’s Frankenstein’s monster will\r\nhave to be regarded as a prophecy. But no Chemist, or Alchemist either,\r\nwill ever endow such a monster with more than animal instinct, unless\r\nindeed he does that with which the “Progenitors” are credited, namely,\r\nleave his own Physical Body, and incarnate in the “Empty Form.” But even\r\nthis would be an _artificial_, not a natural man, for our “Progenitors”\r\nhad, in the course of eternal evolution, to become _Gods_ before they\r\nbecame Men.\r\n\r\nThe above digression—if indeed it is one—is an attempt at justification\r\nbefore the few thinking men of the coming century who may read this.\r\n\r\nIt also gives the reason why the best and most spiritual men of our\r\npresent day can no longer be satisfied with either Science or Theology,\r\nand why they prefer any “psychic craze” to the dogmatic assertions of the\r\npair, since neither of them, in its infallibility, has anything better to\r\noffer than _blind_ faith. _Universal_ tradition is by far the safer guide\r\nin life. And universal tradition shows Primitive Man living for ages\r\ntogether with his Creators and first Instructors—the Elohim—in the World’s\r\n“Garden of Eden,” or “Delight.”(783)\r\n\r\n45. THE FIRST GREAT WATERS CAME. THEY SWALLOWED THE SEVEN GREAT ISLANDS\r\n(_A_).\r\n\r\n46. ALL HOLY SAVED, THE UNHOLY DESTROYED. WITH THEM MOST OF THE HUGE\r\nANIMALS, PRODUCED FROM THE SWEAT OF THE EARTH (_B_).\r\n\r\n(_a_) As this subject—the fourth great Deluge on our Globe in this\r\nRound—is fully treated in the Sections that follow the last Stanza, to say\r\nanything more at present would be a mere anticipation. The seven Great\r\nIslands (Dvîpas) belonged to the Continent of Atlantis. The Secret\r\nTeachings show that the Deluge overtook the Fourth, Giant Race, not on\r\naccount of its depravity, or because it had become “black with sin,” but\r\nsimply because such is the fate of every Continent, which—like everything\r\nelse under our Sun—is born, lives, becomes decrepit, and dies. This was\r\nwhen the Fifth Race was in its infancy.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Thus the Giants perished—the Magicians and the Sorcerers, adds the\r\nfancy of popular tradition. But “all holy saved,” and alone the “unholy”\r\nwere “destroyed.” This was due, however, as much to the _prevision_ of the\r\n“holy” ones, who had not lost the use of their Third Eye, as to Karma and\r\nNatural Law. Speaking of the subsequent Race, our Fifth Humanity, the\r\nCommentary says:\r\n\r\n_Alone the handful of those Elect, whose Divine Instructors had gone to __\r\ninhabit that Sacred Island—__“__from whence the last Saviour will\r\ncome__”__—now kept mankind from becoming one‐half the exterminator of the\r\nother [as mankind is now_—H.

Two‐\r\nthirds of it were ruled by Dynasties of lower, material Spirits of the\r\nEarth, who took possession of the easily accessible bodies; one‐third\r\nremained faithful, and joined with the nascent Fifth Race—the Divine\r\nIncarnates. When the Poles moved [for the fourth time] this did not affect\r\nthose who were protected, and who had separated from the Fourth Race.

THE SERPENTS WHO RE‐DESCENDED, WHO MADE PEACE WITH THE FIFTH,(787)\r\nWHO TAUGHT AND INSTRUCTED IT (_b_)....\r\n\r\n(_a_) This Shloka relates to the Fifth Race. History does not begin with\r\nit, but living and ever‐recurring tradition does. History—or what is\r\ncalled history—does not go back further than the fantastic origins of our\r\nfifth sub‐race, a “few thousands” of years. It is the sub‐divisions of the\r\nfirst sub‐race of the Fifth Root‐Race which are referred to in the\r\nsentence, “Some yellow, some brown and black, and some red remained.” The\r\n“moon‐coloured”—_i.e._, the First and the Second Races—were gone for ever;\r\nay, without leaving any traces whatever—and that, so far back as the third\r\n“Deluge” of the Third Lemurian Race, that “Great Dragon,” whose tail\r\nsweeps whole nations out of existence in the twinkling of an eye. And this\r\nis the true meaning of the verse in the Commentary which says:\r\n\r\n_The Great Dragon has respect but for the Serpents of Wisdom, the Serpents\r\nwhose holes are now under the Triangular Stones._\r\n\r\nOr in other words, “the pyramids, at the four corners of the world.”\r\n\r\n(_b_) This puts clearly what is mentioned more than once elsewhere in the\r\nCommentaries; namely, that the Adepts or “Wise” men of the Third, Fourth\r\nand Fifth Races dwelt in subterranean habitats, generally under some kind\r\nof pyramidal structure, if not actually under a pyramid. For such\r\n“pyramids” existed in the “four corners of the world” and were never the\r\nmonopoly of the land of the Pharaohs, though indeed until they were found\r\nscattered all over the two Americas, under and above ground, beneath and\r\namidst virgin forests, and also in plain and vale, they were generally\r\nsupposed to be the exclusive property of Egypt. If true geometrically\r\ncorrect pyramids are no longer found in European regions, nevertheless\r\nmany of the supposed early neolithic caves, of the colossal triangular\r\npyramidal and conical “menhirs” in Morbihan, and Brittany generally, many\r\nof the Danish “tumuli” and even of the “giant tombs” of Sardinia with\r\ntheir inseparable companions, the “nuraghi,” are so many more or less\r\nclumsy copies of the pyramids. Most of these are the works of the first\r\nsettlers on the newly‐born continent and isles of Europe, the “some\r\nyellow, some brown and black, and some red” races that remained after the\r\nsubmersion of the last Atlantean continents and islands, 850,000 years\r\nago—Plato’s Island excepted—and before the arrival of the great Âryan\r\nraces; while others were built by the earliest immigrants from the East.\r\nThose who can hardly accept the placing of the antiquity of the human race\r\nso far back as the 57,000 years, the age assigned by Dr. Dowler to the\r\nskeleton found by him at New Orleans on the banks of the Mississippi,\r\nwill, of course, reject these facts. But they may find themselves mistaken\r\nsome day. We may disparage the foolish self‐glorification of the Arcadians\r\nwho styled themselves “older than the Moon” (προσέληνοι), and of the\r\npeople of Attica, who claimed that they had existed before the Sun\r\nappeared in Heaven—but not their undeniable antiquity. Nor can we laugh at\r\nthe universal belief that we had giant ancestors. The fact that the bones\r\nof the Mammoth and Mastodon, and, in one case, those of a gigantic\r\nSalamander, have been mistaken for human bones, does not make away with\r\nthe difficulty that, of all the Mammalians, man is the only one whom\r\nScience will not allow to have dwarfed down, like all other animal frames,\r\nfrom the giant Homo Diluvii to the creature between five and six feet that\r\nhe is now.\r\n\r\nBut the “Serpents of Wisdom” have preserved their records well, and the\r\nhistory of human evolution _is_ traced in Heaven as it is traced on\r\nunderground walls. Humanity and the _Stars_ are bound together\r\nindissolubly, because of the _Intelligences_ that rule the latter.\r\n\r\nModern Symbologists may scoff at this and call it “fancy,” but as Mr.\r\nStaniland Wake writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is unquestionable that the Deluge has [ever] been associated in\r\n    the legends of some Eastern peoples not only with the Pyramids,\r\n    but also with the constellations.(788)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “Old Dragon” is identical with the “Great Flood,” says Mr. Proctor:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We know that in the past the constellation of the Dragon was at\r\n    the pole, or boss, of the celestial sphere. In stellar temples,\r\n    ... the Dragon would be the uppermost or ruling constellation....\r\n    It is singular how closely these constellations ... correspond in\r\n    sequence and in range of right ascension with the events recorded\r\n    respecting the [Biblical] Flood.(789)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reasons for this _singularity_, however, have been made abundantly\r\nclear in this work. It only shows that there were _several_ Deluges\r\nconfused in the memories and traditions of the sub‐races of the Fifth\r\nRace. The first great Flood was astronomical and cosmical, while several\r\nothers were terrestrial. And yet our very learned friend Mr. Gerald\r\nMassey—an initiate truly in the mysteries of the British Museum, still\r\nonly a self‐initiate—declared and insisted that the Atlantean Submersion\r\nand Deluge were only the anthropomorphized fancies of ignorant people, and\r\nthat Atlantis was no better than an “astronomical allegory.” But the great\r\nzodiacal allegory is based upon historical events, and allegory can hardly\r\ninterfere with history; moreover, every student of Occultism knows what\r\nthat astronomical and zodiacal allegory means. Dr. Smith shows in the\r\nNimrod Epic of the Assyrian tablets the real meaning of the allegory.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Its twelve cantos] refer to the annual course of the Sun through\r\n    the twelve months of the year. Each tablet answers to a special\r\n    month, and contains a distinct reference to the animal forms in\r\n    the signs of the Zodiac; ... [the eleventh canto being]\r\n    consecrated to Rimmon, the God of storms and rain, and harmonizes\r\n    with the eleventh sign of the Zodiac—Aquarius, or the\r\n    Waterman.(790)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut even this is preceded in the old Records by the _pre_‐astronomical\r\nCosmic Flood, which became allegorized and symbolized in the above\r\nZodiacal or Noah’s Flood. But this has nothing to do with Atlantis. The\r\nPyramids are closely connected with the ideas of both the constellation of\r\nthe Great Dragon, the “Dragons of Wisdom,” or the great Initiates of the\r\nThird and Fourth Races, and the floods of the Nile, regarded as a divine\r\nreminder of the great Atlantic Flood. The astronomical records of\r\nUniversal History, however, are said to have had their beginnings with the\r\nthird sub‐race of the Fourth Root‐Race or the Atlanteans. When was it?\r\nOccult data show that even since the time of the regular establishment of\r\nthe zodiacal calculations in Egypt, _the poles have been thrice inverted_.\r\n\r\nWe will presently return again to this statement. Such symbols as are\r\nrepresented by the Signs of the Zodiac—a fact which offers a handle to\r\nMaterialists upon which to hang their one‐sided theories and opinions—have\r\ntoo profound a signification, and their bearing upon our Humanity is too\r\nimportant, to suffer dismissal in a few words. Meanwhile, we have to\r\nconsider the meaning of the statement, in Shloka 48, concerning the “first\r\nDivine Kings,” who are said to have “redescended,” guided and _instructed_\r\nour Fifth Race after the last Deluge! We shall consider this last claim\r\nhistorically in the Sections that follow, but must end with a few more\r\ndetails on the subject of “Serpents.”\r\n\r\nThe rough commentaries on the Archaic Stanzas have to end here. Further\r\nelucidation requires proofs obtained from ancient, mediæval, and modern\r\nworks which have treated of these subjects. All such evidence has now to\r\nbe gathered in, collated and brought together in better order, so as to\r\ncompel the attention of the reader to this wealth of historical proofs.\r\nAnd as the manifold meaning of the weird and suggestive symbol (so often\r\nreferred to) of the “tempter of man”—in the orthodox light of the\r\nChurch—can never be too strongly insisted upon, it seems more advisable to\r\nexhaust the subject by every available proof, at this juncture, even at\r\nthe risk of repetition. The Titans and Kabirs have been invariably made\r\nout by our Theologians and some pious Symbologists to be indissolubly\r\nconnected with the grotesque personage called the “Devil,” and every proof\r\nwhich goes against their theory has been hitherto as invariably rejected\r\nand ignored. The Occultist must, therefore, neglect nothing which may tend\r\nto defeat this conspiracy of slander. And so we propose to divide the\r\nsubjects involved in these last three Verses into several groups, and to\r\nexamine them as carefully and as fully as space permits. A few more\r\ndetails may thus be added to the general evidences of antiquity, on the\r\nmost disputed tenets of Occultism and the Esoteric Doctrine—the bulk of\r\nwhich, however, will be found in Part II, on Symbology.\r\n\r\n\r\nSerpents And Dragons Under Different Symbolisms.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name of the Dragon in Chaldæa was not written phonetically, but was\r\nrepresented by two monograms, meaning _probably_, according to the\r\nOrientalists, the “scaly one.” “This description,” very pertinently\r\nremarks G. Smith, “of course might apply either to a fabulous dragon, a\r\nserpent, or a fish.” To this we may add that, in one aspect, it applies to\r\nMakara, the tenth Zodiacal Sign, the Sanskrit term for a nondescript\r\namphibious animal, generally called Crocodile, but really signifying\r\nsomething else. This, then, is a virtual admission that the\r\nAssyriologists, at all events, know nothing certain as to the status of\r\nthe Dragon in ancient Chaldæa. It was from Chaldæa that the Hebrews got\r\n_their_ symbolism, only to be afterwards robbed of it by the Christians,\r\nwho made of the “scaly one” a living entity and a maleficent power.\r\n\r\nA specimen of Dragons, “winged and scaled,” may be seen in the British\r\nMuseum. In this representation of the events of the Fall, according to the\r\nsame authority, there are also two figures sitting on each side of a\r\n“tree,” and holding out their hands to the “apple,” while at the back of\r\nthe “tree” is the Dragon‐Serpent. Esoterically, the two figures are two\r\n“Chaldees” ready for Initiation, the Serpent symbolizing the Initiator;\r\nwhile the jealous Gods, who curse the three, are the exoteric profane\r\nclergy. Not much of the literal “biblical event” there, as any Occultist\r\ncan see!\r\n\r\n“The Great Dragon has respect but for the Serpents of Wisdom,” says the\r\nStanza; thus proving the correctness of our explanation of the two figures\r\nand the “Serpent.”\r\n\r\n“The Serpents who redescended, .... who taught and instructed” the Fifth\r\nRace. What sane man, in our day, is capable of believing that _real_\r\nserpents are hereby meant? Hence the rough guess—now become almost an\r\naxiom with men of Science—that those who in antiquity wrote upon various\r\nsacred Dragons and Serpents were either superstitious and credulous\r\npeople, or were bent upon deceiving those more ignorant than themselves.\r\nYet, from Homer downwards, the term implied something hidden from the\r\nProfane.\r\n\r\n“Terrible are the Gods when they manifest themselves”—those _Gods_ whom\r\nmen call _Dragons_. And Ælianus, treating in his _De Naturâ Animalium_ of\r\nthese ophidian symbols, makes certain remarks which show that he well\r\nunderstood the nature of these most ancient of symbols. Thus with\r\nreference to the above Homeric verse he most pertinently explains:\r\n\r\n\r\n    For the Dragon, while sacred and to be worshipped, _has within\r\n    himself something still more of the divine nature_ of which it is\r\n    better [for others?] to remain in ignorance.(791)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “Dragon” symbol has a septenary meaning, and of these seven meanings,\r\nthe highest and the lowest may be given. The highest is identical with the\r\n“Self‐born,” the Logos, the Hindû Aja. With the Christian Gnostics called\r\nthe Naasenians, or Serpent‐worshippers, he was the Second Person of the\r\nTrinity, the Son. His symbol was the constellation of the Dragon.(792) Its\r\nseven “Stars” are the seven stars held in the hand of the “Alpha and\r\nOmega” in _Revelation_. In its most terrestrial meaning, the term “Dragon”\r\nwas applied to the “Wise” men.\r\n\r\nThis portion of the religious symbolism of antiquity is very abstruse and\r\nmysterious, and may remain incomprehensible to the profane. In our modern\r\nday it so jars on the Christian ear that, in spite of our boasted\r\ncivilization, it can hardly escape being regarded as a direct denunciation\r\nof the most cherished of Christian dogmas. Such a subject required, to do\r\nit justice, the pen and genius of Milton, whose poetical fiction has now\r\ntaken root in the Church as a revealed dogma.\r\n\r\nDid the allegory of the Dragon and his supposed conqueror in Heaven\r\noriginate with St. John, in his _Revelation_? Emphatically we answer—No.\r\nSt. John’s “Dragon” is Neptune, the symbol of Atlantean Magic.\r\n\r\nIn order that we may demonstrate this negation, the reader is asked to\r\nexamine the symbolism of the Serpent or the Dragon under its several\r\naspects.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sidereal And Cosmic Glyphs.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery Astronomer—not to speak of Occultists and Astrologers—knows that,\r\nfiguratively speaking, the Astral Light, the Milky Way, and also the Path\r\nof the Sun to the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, as well as the Circles\r\nof the Sidereal or Tropical Year, were always called “Serpents” in the\r\nallegorical and mystic phraseology of the Adepts.\r\n\r\nThis, cosmically, as well as metaphorically. Poseidon is a “Dragon”—the\r\nDragon “Chozzar, called by the profane Neptune” according to the Peratæ\r\nGnostics, the “Good and Perfect Serpent,” the Messiah of the Naaseni,\r\nwhose symbol in Heaven is Draco.\r\n\r\nBut we ought to discriminate between the various characters of this\r\nsymbol. Now Zoroastrian Esotericism is identical with that of the Secret\r\nDoctrine, and when an Occultist reads in the _Vendîdâd_ complaints uttered\r\nagainst the “Serpent,” whose bites have transformed the beautiful, eternal\r\nspring of Airyana Vaêjô, changing it into winter, generating disease and\r\ndeath, and at the same time mental and psychic consumption—he knows that\r\nthe Serpent alluded to is the North Pole, and also the Pole of the\r\nHeavens.(793) These two axes produce the seasons according to their angle\r\nof inclination to each other. The two axes were _no more parallel_; hence\r\nthe eternal spring of Airyana Vaêjô “by the good river Dâitya” had\r\ndisappeared, and “the Âryan Magi had to emigrate to Sogdiana”—say the\r\nexoteric accounts. But the Esoteric Teaching states that the pole had\r\npassed from the equator, and that the “Land of Bliss” of the Fourth Race,\r\nits inheritance from the Third, had now become the region of desolation\r\nand woe. This alone ought to be an incontrovertible proof of the great\r\nantiquity of the Zoroastrian Scriptures. The Neo‐Âryans of the post‐\r\ndiluvian age could, of course, hardly recognize the mountains, on the\r\nsummits of which their forefathers had met _before_ the Flood, and\r\nconversed with the pure “Yazatas” or celestial Spirits of the Elements,\r\nwhose life and _food_ they had once shared. As shown by Eckstein:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The _Vendîdâd_ seems to point out a great change in the atmosphere\r\n    of central Asia; strong volcanic eruptions and the collapse of a\r\n    whole range of mountains in the neighbourhood of the Kara‐Korum\r\n    chain.(794)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians, according to Eusebius, who, for a wonder, once wrote the\r\ntruth, symbolized Kosmos by a large fiery circle, with a serpent with a\r\nhawk’s head lying across its diameter.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Here we see the pole of the earth within the plane of the\r\n    ecliptic, attended with all the fiery consequences that must arise\r\n    from such a state of the heavens: when the whole Zodiac, in 25,000\r\n    [odd] years, must have “redden’d with the solar blaze”; and _each\r\n    sign must have been vertical_ to the polar region.(795)\r\n\r\n\r\nMeru, the Abode of the Gods, as explained before, was placed in the North\r\nPole, while Pâtâla, the Nether Region, was supposed to lie towards the\r\nSouth. As each symbol in Esoteric Philosophy has _seven_ keys, Meru and\r\nPâtâla have, geographically, one significance and represent localities,\r\nwhile, astronomically, they have another, and mean the “two poles”; the\r\nlatter meaning led to their being often rendered in _exoteric_\r\nsectarianism as the “Mountain” and the “Pit,” or Heaven and Hell. If we\r\nfor the present hold only to the astronomical and geographical\r\nsignificance, it may be found that the Ancients knew the topography and\r\nnature of the Arctic and Antarctic regions better than any of our modern\r\nAstronomers. They had reasons, and good ones, for naming one the\r\n“Mountain” and the other the “Pit.” As the author just quoted half\r\nexplains, Helion and Acheron meant nearly the same. “Heli‐on is the Sun in\r\nhis highest,” Heli‐os or Eli‐os meaning the “most high,” and Acheron is 32\r\ndegrees above the pole, and 32 below it, the allegorical river being thus\r\nsupposed to touch the northern horizon in the latitude of 32 degrees. The\r\nvast concave, that is for ever hidden from our sight and which surrounded\r\nthe southern pole, the first astronomers called the Pit, while observing,\r\ntoward the northern pole, that a certain circuit in the heavens always\r\nappeared above the horizon—they called it the Mountain. As Meru is the\r\nhigh abode of the Gods, these were said to _ascend_ and _descend_\r\nperiodically; by which (astronomically) the _Zodiacal_ Gods were meant,\r\nthe passing of the original north pole of the Earth to the south pole of\r\nthe Heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n    In that age at noon, the ecliptic would be parallel with the\r\n    meridian, and part of the Zodiac would descend from the north pole\r\n    to the north horizon; crossing the _eight coils of the serpent_\r\n    [eight sidereal years, or over 200,000 solar years], which would\r\n    seem like an imaginary _ladder_ with _eight staves_ reaching from\r\n    the earth up to the pole, _i.e._, the throne of Jove. Up this\r\n    ladder, then, the Gods, _i.e._, the Signs of the Zodiac, ascended\r\n    and descended. [Jacob’s ladder and the Angels] .... It is more\r\n    than 400,000 years since the Zodiac formed the sides of this\r\n    ladder.(796)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an ingenious explanation, even if it is not altogether free from\r\nOccult heresy. Yet it is nearer the truth than many of a more scientific\r\nand especially theological character. As said, the Christian Trinity was\r\npurely astronomical from its beginning. This it was which made Rutilius\r\nsay of those who euhemerized it: “_Judæa gens, radix stultorum_.”\r\n\r\nBut the profane, and especially Christian fanatics who are ever in search\r\nof scientific corroboration for their dead‐letter texts, persist in seeing\r\nin the Celestial Pole the true Serpent of _Genesis_, Satan, the enemy of\r\nmankind; whereas it is really—a cosmic metaphor. When the Gods are said to\r\nforsake the Earth, it means not only the Gods, the Protectors and\r\nInstructors, but also the _minor_ Gods—the Regents of the Zodiacal Signs.\r\nThe former, as actual and existing Entities which gave birth to, nursed,\r\nand instructed Mankind in its early youth, appear in every Scripture, in\r\nthat of the Zoroastrians as well as in the Hindû Gospels. Ormazd, or Ahura\r\nMazda, the “Lord of Wisdom,” is the synthesis of the Amshaspands, or\r\nAmesha Spentas, the “Immortal Benefactors,”(797) the “Word,” or the Logos,\r\nand its six highest aspects in Mazdeanism. These “Immortal Benefactors”\r\nare described in _Zamyad Yasht_ as:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Amesha Spentas, the shining, having efficacious eyes, great,\r\n    helpful ... imperishable and pure ... which are all seven of like\r\n    mind, like speech, all seven doing alike ... which are _the\r\n    creators and destroyers of the creatures_ of Ahura Mazda, their\r\n    creators and overseers, their protectors and rulers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese few lines are sufficient to indicate the dual and even the triple\r\ncharacter of the Amshaspands, our Dhyân Chohans or the “Serpents of\r\nWisdom.” They are identical with, and yet separate from Ormazd (Ahura\r\nMazda). They are also the Angels of the Stars of the Christians—the Star‐\r\nYazatas of the Zoroastrians—or again the seven Planets (including the Sun)\r\nof every religion.(798) The epithet, “the shining, having efficacious\r\neyes,” proves it. This on the physical and sidereal planes. On the\r\nspiritual, they are the Divine Powers of Ahura Mazda; but on the astral or\r\npsychic plane again, they are the “Builders,” the “Watchers,” the Pitris,\r\nor Fathers, and the first Preceptors of Mankind.\r\n\r\nWhen mortals have become sufficiently spiritualized, there will be no more\r\nneed of _forcing_ them into a correct comprehension of ancient Wisdom. Men\r\nwill _know_ then, that there never yet was a great World‐reformer whose\r\nname has passed into our generation, who (_a_) was not a direct emanation\r\nof the Logos (under whatever name known to us) _i.e._, an _essential_\r\nincarnation of one of the “Seven,” of the “Divine Spirit who is\r\nsevenfold”; and (_b_) who had not appeared before, in past Cycles. They\r\nwill recognize, then, the cause which produces certain riddles of the\r\nages, in both history and chronology; the reason, for instance, why it is\r\nimpossible _for them_ to assign any reliable date to Zoroaster, who is\r\nfound multiplied by twelve and fourteen in the _Dabistan_; why the numbers\r\nand individualities of the Rishis and Manus are so mixed up; why Krishna\r\nand Buddha speak of themselves as reïncarnations, Krishna identifying\r\nhimself with the Rishi Nârâyana, and Gautama giving a series of his\r\nprevious births; and why the former, especially, being “the _very supreme_\r\nBrahmâ,” is yet called Anshânshâvatâra—“a part of a part” only of the\r\nSupreme on Earth; finally, why Osiris is a Great God, and at the same time\r\na “Prince on Earth,” who reäppears in Thoth Hermes; and why Jesus (in\r\nHebrew, Joshua) of Nazareth is recognized, kabalistically, in Joshua, the\r\nson of Nun, as well as in other personages. The Esoteric Doctrine explains\r\nall this by saying that each of these, as also many others, had first\r\nappeared on Earth as one of the Seven Powers of the Logos, individualized\r\nas a God or Angel (Messenger); then, mixed with Matter, they had\r\nreäppeared in turn as great Sages and Instructors who “taught” the Fifth\r\nRace, after having instructed the two preceding Races, had ruled during\r\nthe Divine Dynasties, and had finally sacrificed themselves, to be reborn\r\nunder various circumstances for the good of Mankind, and for its salvation\r\nat certain critical periods; until in their last incarnations they had\r\nbecome truly only the “parts of a part” on Earth, though _de facto_ the\r\nOne Supreme in Nature.\r\n\r\nThis is the metaphysics of Theogony. Now every “Power” among the Seven,\r\nonce he is individualized, has in his charge one of the elements of\r\ncreation, and rules over it;(799) hence the many meanings in every symbol.\r\nThese, unless interpreted according to the Esoteric methods, generally\r\nlead to inextricable confusion.\r\n\r\nDoes the Western Kabalist, who is generally an opponent of the Eastern\r\nOccultist, require a proof? Let him open Éliphas Lévi’s _Histoire de la\r\nMagie_,(800) and carefully examine his “Grand Symbole Kabbalistique” from\r\nthe _Zohar_. He will find there, in the engraving, a development of the\r\n“interlaced triangles,” a _white_ man above and a _black_ woman below\r\nreversed, the legs passing under the extended arms of the male figure, and\r\nprotruding behind the shoulders, while their hands join at an angle on\r\neach side. Éliphas Lévi makes of this symbol, God and Nature; or God,\r\n“Light,” mirrored inversely in Nature and Matter, “Darkness.”\r\nKabalistically and symbolically he is right; but only so far as\r\nemblematical cosmogony goes. Neither has he invented the symbol, nor have\r\nthe Kabalists. The two figures in white and black stone have existed in\r\nthe temples of Egypt from time immemorial, agreeably to tradition, and\r\nhistorically‐ever since the day of King Cambyses, who personally saw them.\r\nTherefore the symbol must have been in existence for nearly 2,500 years.\r\nThis, at the very least, for Cambyses, who was a son of Cyrus the Great,\r\nsucceeded his father in the year 529 B.C. These figures were the two\r\nKabiri personifying the _opposite poles_. Herodotus(801) tells posterity\r\nthat when Cambyses entered the temple of the Kabirim, he burst into an\r\ninextinguishable fit of laughter, on perceiving what he thought to be a\r\nman erect and a woman standing on the top of her head before him. These\r\nwere the poles, however, whose symbol was intended to commemorate “the\r\npassing of the original north pole of the earth to the south pole of the\r\nheaven,” as perceived by Mackey.(802) But they also represented the poles\r\n_inverted_, in consequence of the great inclination of the axis, which\r\neach time resulted in the displacement of the oceans, the submersion of\r\nthe polar lands, and the consequent upheaval of new continents in the\r\nequatorial regions, and _vice versâ_. These Kabirim were the “Deluge”\r\nGods.\r\n\r\nThis may help us to get at the key of the seemingly hopeless confusion\r\namong the numbers of names and titles given to one and the same Gods, and\r\nclasses of Gods. Faber, at the beginning of this century, showed the\r\nidentity of the Corybantes, Curetes, Dioscuri, Anactes, Dii Magni, Idei,\r\nDactyli, Lares, Penates, Manes,(803) Titans, and Aletæ with the Kabiri.\r\nAnd we have shown that the latter were the same as the Manus, the Rishis,\r\nand our Dhyân Chohans who incarnated in the Elect of the Third and Fourth\r\nRaces. Thus, while in Theogony the Kabiri‐Titans were seven Great Gods,\r\ncosmically and astronomically the Titans were called Atlantes, because,\r\nperhaps, as Faber says, they were connected with _at‐al‐as_, the “divine\r\nsun,” and with _tit_, the “deluge.” But this, if true, is only the\r\nexoteric version. Esoterically, the meaning of their symbols depends on\r\nthe appellation, or title, used. The seven mysterious, awe‐inspiring Great\r\nGods—the Dioscuri,(804) the deities surrounded with the darkness of Occult\r\nNature—become the Idei Dactyli, or Ideic “Fingers,” with the Adept‐healers\r\nby metals. The true etymology of the name Lares, now signifying “Ghosts,”\r\nmust be sought in the Etruscan word _lars_, “conductor,” “leader.”\r\nSanchuniathon translates the word Aletæ as “fire worshippers,” and Faber\r\nbelieves it to be derived from _al‐orit_, the “God of fire.” Both are\r\nright, for in both cases it is a reference to the Sun, the “highest” God,\r\ntoward whom the Planetary Gods “gravitate” (astronomically and\r\nallegorically), and whom they worship. As Lares, they are truly the Solar\r\nDeities, though Faber’s etymology, that “Lar is a contraction of El‐Ar,\r\nthe solar deity,”(805) is not very correct. They are the Lares, the\r\nConductors and Leaders of men. As Aletæ, they were the seven\r\nPlanets—astronomically; and as Lares, the Regents of these Planets, our\r\nProtectors and Rulers—mystically. For purposes of exoteric or phallic\r\nworship, and also cosmically, they were the Kabiri, whose attributes and\r\ndual capacities were denoted by the names of the temples to which they\r\nrespectively belonged, and also by those of their priests. They all\r\nbelonged, however, to the septenary creative and informing groups of Dhyân\r\nChohans. The Sabæans, who worshipped the “Regents of the Seven Planets”\r\njust as the Hindûs worship their Rishis, held Seth and his son Hermes\r\n(Enoch or Enos) as the highest among the Planetary Gods. Seth and Enos\r\nwere borrowed from the Sabæans and then disfigured by the Jews\r\n(exoterically); but the truth about them can still be discovered even in\r\n_Genesis_.(806) Seth is the “Progenitor” of those early men of the Third\r\nRace in whom the Planetary Angels had incarnated; he was himself a Dhyân\r\nChohan and belonged to the _informing_ Gods, and Enos (Hanoch or Enoch),\r\nor Hermes, was said to be his _son_—Enos being a generic name for all the\r\nearly “Seers” (Enoïchion). Thence the worship. The Arabic writer Soyuti\r\nsays that the earliest records mention Seth, or Set, as the founder of\r\nSabaism, and that the pyramids which embody the planetary system were\r\nregarded as the place of sepulchre of both Seth and Idrus (Hermes or\r\nEnoch);(807) that thither Sabæans proceeded on pilgrimage, and chanted\r\nprayers _seven times_ a day, _turning to the North_ (Mount Meru, Kaph,\r\nOlympus, etc.).(808) Abd Allatif also tells us some curious things about\r\nthe Sabæans and their books. So also does Eddin Ahmed Ben Yahya, who wrote\r\n200 years later. While the latter maintains “that each pyramid was\r\nconsecrated to a _star_” (a Star _Regent_ rather), Abd Allatif assures us\r\nthat he had read in ancient Sabæan books that “one pyramid was the tomb of\r\nAgathodæmon and the other of Hermes”:(809)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Agathodæmon was none other than Seth, and, according to some\r\n    writers, Hermes was his son,\r\n\r\n\r\nadds Mr. Staniland Wake in _The Great Pyramid_.(810)\r\n\r\nThus, while in Samothrace and the oldest Egyptian temples the Kabiri were\r\nthe Great Cosmic Gods—the Seven and the _Forty‐nine_ Sacred Fires—in the\r\nGrecian fanes their rites became mostly phallic, and therefore, to the\r\nprofane, obscene. In the latter case they were three and four, or\r\nseven—the male and female principles—the _crux ansata_. This division\r\nshows why some classical writers held that they were only three, while\r\nothers named four. And these were Axieros (in his female aspect Demeter);\r\nAxiokersa (Persephone);(811) Axiokersos (Pluto or Hades); and Kadmos or\r\nKasmilos (Hermes—not the ithyphallic Hermes mentioned by Herodotus,(812)\r\nbut “he of the sacred legend,” which was explained only during the\r\nSamothracian Mysteries). This identification, which is due, according to\r\nthe Scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius,(813) to an indiscretion of Mnaseas,\r\nis really no identification at all, as names alone do not reveal\r\nmuch.(814) Others again have maintained, being equally right in their way,\r\nthat there were only two Kabiri. These were, esoterically, the two\r\nDioscuri, Castor and Pollux, and exoterically, Jupiter and Bacchus. These\r\ntwo personified the terrestrial poles, geodesically; the terrestrial pole,\r\nand the pole of the heavens, astronomically; and also the physical and the\r\nspiritual man. The story of Semele and Jupiter and the birth of Bacchus,\r\nBimater, with all the circumstances attending it, needs only to be read\r\nesoterically for the understanding of the allegory. The parts played in\r\nthe event by the Fire, Water, Earth, etc., in the many versions, will show\r\nhow the “Father of the Gods” and the “merry God of Wine” were also made to\r\npersonify the two terrestrial poles. The telluric, metalline, magnetic,\r\nelectric and the fiery elements are all so many allusions and references\r\nto the cosmic and astronomic character of the diluvian tragedy. In\r\nAstronomy, the poles are indeed the “heavenly measure”; and so are the\r\nKabiri‐Dioscuri, as will be shown, and the Kabiri‐Titans, to whom Diodorus\r\nascribes the “invention of Fire”(815) and the art of manufacturing iron.\r\nMoreover, Pausanias(816) shows that the original Kabiric deity was\r\nPrometheus.\r\n\r\nBut the fact that, astronomically, the Titan‐Kabirim were also the\r\nGenerators and Regulators of the Seasons, and, cosmically, the great\r\nVolcanic Energies—the Gods presiding over all the metals and terrestrial\r\nworks—does not prevent them from being, in their original divine\r\ncharacters, the beneficent Entities who, symbolized in Prometheus, brought\r\nlight to the world, and endowed Humanity with intellect and reason. They\r\nare preëminently in every Theogony—especially in the Hindû—the Sacred\r\nDivine Fires, Three, Seven, or Forty‐nine, according as the allegory\r\ndemands it. Their very names prove it, for they are the Agni‐putra, or\r\nSons of the Fire, in India, and the Genii of the Fire under numerous names\r\nin Greece and elsewhere. Welcker, Maury, and now Decharme, show the name\r\n_kabeiros_ meaning “the powerful through fire,” from the Greek καίω “to\r\nburn.” The Semitic word _kabirim_ contains the idea of “the powerful, the\r\nmighty, and the great,” answering to the Greek μεγάλοι, δυνατοί, but these\r\nare later epithets. These Gods were universally worshipped, and their\r\norigin is lost in the night of time. Yet whether propitiated in Phrygia,\r\nPhœnicia, the Troad, Thrace, Egypt, Lemnos or Sicily, their cult was\r\nalways connected with Fire, their temples ever built in the most volcanic\r\nlocalities, and in exoteric worship they belonged to the Chthonian\r\nDivinities, and therefore has Christianity made of them _Infernal_ Gods.\r\n\r\nThey are truly “the great, beneficent and powerful Gods,” as Cassius\r\nHermone calls them.(817) At Thebes, Core and Demeter, the Kabirim, had a\r\nsanctuary,(818) and at Memphis, the Kabiri had a temple so sacred, that\r\nnone, excepting the priests, were suffered to enter its holy\r\nprecincts.(819) But we must not, at the same time, lose sight of the fact\r\nthat the title of Kabiri was generic; that the Kabiri, the mighty Gods as\r\nwell as mortals, were of both sexes, and also terrestrial, celestial and\r\ncosmic; that while, in their later capacity of rulers of sidereal and\r\nterrestrial powers, a purely geological phenomenon—as it is now\r\nregarded—was symbolized in the persons of those rulers, they were also, in\r\nthe beginning of times, the Rulers of Mankind, when, incarnated as Kings\r\nof the “Divine Dynasties,” they gave the first impulse to civilization,\r\nand directed the mind with which they had endued men, to the invention and\r\nperfection of all the arts and sciences. Thus the Kabiri are said to have\r\nappeared as the benefactors of men, and as such they lived for ages in the\r\nmemory of nations. To these Kabiri or Titans is ascribed the invention of\r\nletters (the Deva‐nâgari, or alphabet and language of the Gods), of laws\r\nand legislature, of architecture, as also of the various modes of magic,\r\nso‐called, and of the medical use of plants. Hermes, Orpheus, Cadmus,\r\nAsclepius, all those Demi‐gods and Heroes, to whom is ascribed the\r\nrevelation of sciences to men, and in whom Bryant, Faber, Bishop\r\nCumberland, and so many other Christian writers—too zealous for plain\r\ntruth—would force posterity to see only Pagan copies of one sole\r\nprototype, named Noah—all are generic names.\r\n\r\nIt is the Kabiri who are credited with having revealed the great boon of\r\nagriculture, by _producing_ corn or wheat. What Isis‐Osiris, the once\r\nliving Kabiria, did in Egypt, that Ceres is said to have done in Sicily;\r\nthey all belong to one class.\r\n\r\nThat serpents were ever emblems of wisdom and prudence is again shown by\r\nthe Caduceus of Mercury, one with Thot, the God of Wisdom, with Hermes,\r\nand so on. The two serpents, entwined round the rod, are phallic symbols\r\nof Jupiter and other Gods who transformed themselves into snakes for\r\npurposes of seducing Goddesses—only in the unclean fancies of profane\r\nSymbologists. The serpent has ever been the symbol of the Adept, and of\r\nhis powers of immortality and divine knowledge. Mercury, in his\r\npsychopompic character, conducting and guiding the souls of the dead to\r\nHades with his Caduceus and even raising them to life with it, is a simple\r\nand very transparent allegory. It shows the dual power of the Secret\r\nWisdom: black and white Magic. It shows this personified Wisdom guiding\r\nthe Soul after death, and displaying the power of calling to life that\r\nwhich is dead—a very deep metaphor if one but thinks over its meaning. All\r\nthe peoples of antiquity, with one exception, reverenced this symbol; the\r\nexception being the Christians, who chose to forget the “brazen serpent”\r\nof Moses, and even the implied acknowledgment of the great wisdom and\r\nprudence of the “serpent” by Jesus himself, “Be ye _wise_ as serpents and\r\nharmless as doves.” The Chinese, one of the oldest nations of our Fifth\r\nRace, made of it the emblem of their Emperors, who are thus the degenerate\r\nsuccessors of the “Serpents” or Initiates, who ruled the early races of\r\nthe Fifth Humanity. The Emperor’s throne is the “Dragon’s Seat,” and his\r\ndresses of State are embroidered with the likeness of the Dragon. The\r\naphorisms in the oldest books of China, moreover, say plainly that the\r\nDragon is a human, albeit _divine_, Being. Speaking of the “Yellow\r\nDragon,” the chief of the others, the _Twan‐ying‐t’u_ says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    His wisdom and virtue are unfathomable ... he does not go in\r\n    company and does not live in herds [he is an ascetic].... He\r\n    wanders in the wilds beyond the heavens. He goes and comes,\r\n    fulfilling the decree [Karma]; at the proper seasons if there is\r\n    perfection he comes forth, if not he remains [invisible].\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd Lü‐lan asserts that Confucius said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Dragon feeds in the pure (water) [of Wisdom] and disports in\r\n    the clear (water) [of Life].(820)\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Divine Instructors.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow Atlantis and the Phlegyan Isle are not the only records left of the\r\nDeluge. China has also her tradition and the story of an island or\r\ncontinent, which it calls Ma‐li‐ga‐si‐ma, and which Kæmpfer and Faber\r\nspell “Maurigasima,” for some mysterious phonetic reasons of their own.\r\nKæmpfer, in his _Japan_,(821) gives the tradition: The island, owing to\r\nthe iniquity of its giants, sinks to the bottom of the ocean, and Peiruun,\r\nthe king, the Chinese Noah, escapes alone with his family owing to a\r\nwarning of the Gods through two idols. It is that pious prince and his\r\ndescendants who have peopled China. The Chinese traditions speak of the\r\nDivine Dynasties of Kings as frequently as do those of any other nation.\r\n\r\nAt the same time there is not an old fragment but shows belief in a\r\nmultiform and even multigeneric evolution of human beings—spiritual,\r\npsychic, intellectual, and physical—just as is described in the present\r\nwork. A few of these claims have now to be considered.\r\n\r\nOur races—they all show—have sprung from Divine Races, by whatever name\r\nthe latter may be called. Whether we deal with the Indian Rishis or\r\nPitris; with the Chinese Chim‐nang and Tchan‐gy—their “Divine Man” and\r\nDemi‐gods; with the Akkadian Dingir and Mul‐lil—the Creative God and the\r\n“Gods of the Ghost‐world”; with the Egyptian Isis‐Osiris and Thot; with\r\nthe Hebrew Elohim; or again with Manco‐Capac and his Peruvian progeny—the\r\nstory varies nowhere. Every nation has either the _seven_ and _ten_ Rishi‐\r\nManus and Prajâpatis; the seven and ten Ki‐y; or _ten_ and _seven_\r\nAmshaspands(822) (six exoterically); ten and seven Chaldæan Annedoti; ten\r\nand seven Sephiroth, etc. One and all have been derived from the primitive\r\nDhyân Chohans of the Esoteric Doctrine, or the “Builders” of the Stanzas\r\nof Volume I. From Manu, Thot‐Hermes, Oannes‐Dagon, and Edris‐Enoch, down\r\nto Plato Panodorus, all tell us of seven Divine Dynasties, of seven\r\nLemurian, and seven Atlantean divisions of the Earth; of the seven\r\nprimitive and dual Gods who descend from their Celestial Abode(823) and\r\nreign on Earth, teaching mankind Astronomy, Architecture, and all the\r\nother sciences that have come down to us. These Beings appear first as\r\nGods and Creators; then they merge in nascent man, to finally emerge as\r\n“Divine Kings and Rulers.” But this fact has been gradually forgotten. As\r\nBasnage shows, the Egyptians themselves confessed that Science had\r\nflourished in their country only since the time of Isis‐Osiris, whom they\r\ncontinued to adore as Gods, “though they had become princes in human\r\nform.” And he adds of the Divine Androgyne:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is said that this prince [Isis‐Osiris] built cities in Egypt,\r\n    stopped the overflowing of the Nile; invented agriculture, the use\r\n    of the vine, music, astronomy, and geometry.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Abul Feda, in his _Historia Anteïslamitica_,(824) says that the\r\n“Sabæan language” was established by Seth and Edris (Enoch)—he means\r\nAstronomy. In the _Melelwa Nahil_,(825) Hermes is called the disciple of\r\nAgathodæmon. And in another account,(826) Agathodæmon is mentioned as a\r\n“King of Egypt.” The _Celepas Geraldinus_ gives us some curious traditions\r\nabout Henoch, who is called the “Divine Giant.” In his _Book of the\r\nVarious Names of the Nile_, the historian Ahmed Ben Yusouf Eltiphas tells\r\nus of the belief among the Semitic Arabs that Seth, who became later the\r\nEgyptian Typhon, Set, had been one of the Seven Angels, or Patriarchs, in\r\nthe _Bible_; then he became a mortal and Adam’s son, after which he\r\ncommunicated the gift of prophecy and astronomical science to Jared, who\r\npassed it to his son Henoch. But Henoch (Idris), “the author of thirty\r\nbooks,” was “Sabæan by origin”—_i.e._, belonged to the Saba, “a Host”:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Having established the rites and ceremonies of primitive worship,\r\n    he went to the East, where he constructed one hundred and forty\r\n    cities, of which Edessa was the least important, then returned to\r\n    Egypt where he became its King.(827)\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, he is identified with Hermes. But there were five Hermes—or rather\r\none, who appeared, as did some Manus and Rishis, in several different\r\ncharacters. In the _Burham i Kati_, he is mentioned as Hormig, a name of\r\nthe Planet Mercury or Budha; and Wednesday was sacred both to Hermes and\r\nThot.(828) The Hermes of Oriental tradition was worshipped by the\r\nPhineatæ, and is said to have fled after the death of Argus into Egypt,\r\nand civilized it under the name of Thoth.(829) But under whichever of\r\nthese characters, he is always credited with having transferred all the\r\nsciences from _latent to active potency_, _i.e._, with having been the\r\nfirst to teach Magic to Egypt and to Greece, before the days of Magna\r\nGræcia, and when the Greeks were not even Hellenes.\r\n\r\nNot only does Herodotus, the “father of history,” tell us of the\r\nmarvellous Dynasties of Gods that preceded the reign of mortals, followed\r\nby the Dynasties of Demi‐gods, Heroes, and finally men, but the whole\r\nseries of classical authors support him. Diodorus, Eratosthenes, Plato,\r\nManetho, etc., repeat the same story, and never vary in the order given.\r\n\r\nAs Creuzer shows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is, indeed, from the spheres of the stars wherein dwell the\r\n    gods of light, that wisdom descends to the inferior spheres.... In\r\n    the system of the ancient priests [Hierophants and Adepts] all\r\n    things without exception, Gods, Genii, Souls [Manes], the whole\r\n    world, are conjointly developed in space and duration. The pyramid\r\n    may be considered as the symbol of this magnificent hierarchy of\r\n    spirits.(830)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the modern historians—French Academicians, like Renan, chiefly—who\r\nhave made more efforts to suppress truth by ignoring the ancient annals of\r\nDivine Kings, than is strictly consistent with honesty. But M. Renan could\r\nnever have been more unwilling than was Eratosthenes (260 B.C.) to accept\r\nthe unpalatable fact; and yet the latter found himself obliged to\r\nrecognize its truth. For this, the great Astronomer is treated with much\r\ncontempt by his colleagues 2,000 years later. Manetho becomes with them “a\r\nsuperstitious priest born and bred in the atmosphere of other lying\r\npriests of Heliopolis.” As the Demonologist De Mirville justly remarks:\r\n\r\n\r\n    All those historians and priests, so _veracious_ when repeating\r\n    stories of _human_ kings and men, suddenly become _extremely\r\n    suspicious_ no sooner do they go back _to their gods_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut there is the synchronistic table of Abydos, which, thanks to the\r\ngenius of Champollion, has now vindicated the good faith of the priests of\r\nEgypt (of Manetho above all), and of Ptolemy, in the Turin papyrus, the\r\nmost remarkable of all. In the words of the Egyptologist, De Rougé:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Champollion, struck with amazement, found that he had under his\r\n    own eyes the remains of a list of Dynasties embracing the furthest\r\n    mythic times, or the _Reigns of the Gods and Heroes_.... At the\r\n    very beginning of this curious papyrus we have to arrive at the\r\n    conviction that, so far back as even the period of Ramses, these\r\n    mythic and heroical traditions were just as Manetho had\r\n    transmitted them to us; we see figuring in them, as Kings of\r\n    Egypt, the Gods Seb, Osiris, Set, Horus, Thoth‐Hermes, and the\r\n    Goddess Ma, a long period of centuries being assigned to the reign\r\n    of each of these.(831)\r\n\r\n\r\nThese synchronistic tables, besides the fact that they were disfigured by\r\nEusebius for dishonest purposes, had never gone beyond Manetho. The\r\nchronology of the Divine Kings and Dynasties, like that of the age of\r\nhumanity, has ever been in the hands of the priests, and kept secret from\r\nthe profane multitudes.\r\n\r\nNow though Africa, as a continent, it is said, appeared before that of\r\nEurope, nevertheless it came up later than Lemuria and even the earliest\r\nAtlantis. The whole region of what is now Egypt and the deserts was once\r\nupon a time covered with the sea. This was made known, firstly, by\r\nHerodotus, Strabo, Pliny, and others, and, secondly, through Geology.\r\nAbyssinia was once upon a time an island, and the Delta was the first\r\ncountry occupied by the pioneer emigrants who came with their Gods from\r\nthe north‐east.\r\n\r\nWhen was it? History is silent upon the subject. Fortunately we have the\r\nDendera Zodiac, the planisphere on the ceiling of one of the oldest\r\nEgyptian temples, to record the fact. This Zodiac, with its mysterious\r\nthree Virgos between Leo and Libra, has found its Œdipus to understand the\r\nriddle of its signs, and justify the truthfulness of those priests who\r\ntold Herodotus, that their Initiates taught (_a_) that the poles of the\r\nEarth and the Ecliptic had formerly coincided, and (_b_) that even since\r\ntheir first Zodiacal records were commenced, the Poles have been three\r\ntimes within the plane of the Ecliptic.\r\n\r\nBailly had not sufficient words at command to express his surprise at the\r\n_sameness_ of all such traditions about the Divine Races, and exclaims:\r\n\r\n\r\n    What are finally all those reigns of Indian Devas and [Persian]\r\n    Peris; or, those reigns of the Chinese legends; those Tien‐hoang\r\n    or the Kings of Heaven, quite distinct from the Ti‐hoang, or Kings\r\n    on Earth, and the Gin‐hoang, the King men, distinctions which are\r\n    in perfect accord with those of the Greeks and Egyptians, in\r\n    enumerating their Dynasties of Gods, of Demi‐gods and\r\n    Mortals.(832)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs says Panodorus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Now, it is during these thousand years [before the Deluge], that\r\n    the _Reign of the Seven Gods_ who rule the world took place. It\r\n    was during that period that those benefactors of humanity\r\n    _descended_ on Earth and taught men to calculate the course of the\r\n    sun and moon by the twelve signs of the Ecliptic.(833)\r\n\r\n\r\nNearly five hundred years before the present era, the priests of Egypt\r\nshowed Herodotus the statues of their human Kings and Pontiffs‐Piromis—the\r\nArch‐prophets or Mahâ Chohans of the temples, _born one from the other_,\r\nwithout the intervention of woman—who had reigned before Menes, their\r\nfirst _human_ King. These statues, he says, were enormous colossi in wood,\r\nthree hundred and forty‐five in number, _each of which had its name,\r\nhistory and annals_. They also assured Herodotus—unless the most truthful\r\nof historians, the “father of history,” is now to be accused of fibbing,\r\n_just in this instance_—that no historian could ever understand or write\r\nan account of these superhuman Kings, unless he had studied and learned\r\nthe history of the _three_ Dynasties that preceded the human—namely, the\r\nDynasties of the Gods, of the Demi‐gods, and of the Heroes, or\r\nGiants.(834) These “three” Dynasties are the three Races.\r\n\r\nTranslated into the language of the Esoteric Doctrine, these three\r\nDynasties would also be those of the Devas, of the Kimpurushas, and of the\r\nDânavas and Daityas—otherwise Gods, Celestial Spirits, and Giants or\r\nTitans. “Happy are those who are born, even from the condition of Gods, as\r\nmen in Bhârata‐varsha!”—exclaim the incarnated Gods themselves, during the\r\nThird Root‐Race. Bhârata is generally India, but in this case it\r\nsymbolizes the Chosen Land of those days, which was considered the best of\r\nthe divisions of Jambu‐dvîpa, as it was the land of active (spiritual)\r\nworks _par excellence_; the land of Initiation and of Divine\r\nKnowledge.(835)\r\n\r\nCan one fail to recognize in Creuzer great powers of intuition, when,\r\nalthough he was almost unacquainted with the Âryan Hindû philosophies,\r\nwhich were but little known in his day, we find him writing:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We modern Europeans feel surprised when hearing talk of the\r\n    Spirits of the Sun, Moon, etc. But we repeat again, _the natural\r\n    good sense and the upright judgment_ of the ancient peoples, quite\r\n    foreign to our _entirely material_ ideas of mechanics and physical\r\n    sciences ... could not see in the stars and planets nothing but\r\n    simple masses of light, or opaque bodies moving in circuits in\r\n    sidereal space, merely according to the laws of attraction or\r\n    repulsion; they saw in them _living_ bodies, _animated_ by spirits\r\n    as they saw the same in every kingdom of nature.... _This doctrine\r\n    of spirits, so consistent and conformable to nature_, from which\r\n    it was derived, formed a grand and unique conception, wherein the\r\n    physical, the moral, and the political aspects were all blended\r\n    together.(836)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is such a conception only that can lead man to form a correct\r\nconclusion about his origin and the genesis of everything in the\r\nUniverse—of Heaven and Earth, between which he is a living link. Without\r\nsuch a psychological link, and the feeling of its presence, no Science can\r\never progress, and the realm of knowledge must be limited to the analysis\r\nof physical matter only.\r\n\r\nOccultists believe in “spirits,” because they _feel_—and some\r\nsee—themselves surrounded by them on every side.(837) Materialists do not.\r\nThey live on this Earth, just as some creatures, in the world of insects\r\nand even of fishes, live surrounded by myriads of their own genus, without\r\nseeing, or so much as sensing them.(838)\r\n\r\nPlato is the first sage among classical writers who speaks at length of\r\nthe Divine Dynasties. He locates them on a vast continent which he calls\r\nAtlantis. Nor was Bailly the first or last to believe this. He had been\r\npreceded and anticipated in this theory by Father Kircher, the learned\r\nJesuit, who in his _Œdipus Ægyptiacus_, writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I confess, for a long time I had regarded all this [the Dynasties\r\n    and Atlantis] as pure fables (_meras nugas_) to the day when,\r\n    better instructed in Oriental languages, I judged that all those\r\n    legends must be, after all, only the development of a great\r\n    truth.(839)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs De Rougemont shows, Theopompus, in his _Meropis_, made the priests of\r\nPhrygia and Asia Minor speak exactly as did the priests of Saïs when they\r\nrevealed to Solon the history and fate of Atlantis. According to\r\nTheopompus, it was a unique continent of an indefinite size, containing\r\ntwo countries inhabited by two races—a fighting, warrior race, and a\r\npious, meditative race(840)—which Theopompus symbolizes by two\r\ncities.(841) The pious “city” was _continually visited by the Gods_: the\r\nbelligerent “city” was inhabited by various beings _invulnerable_ by iron,\r\nwho could be _mortally wounded_ only by stone and wood.(842) De Rougemont\r\ntreats this as a pure _fiction_ of Theopompus and even sees a fraud\r\n(_supercherie_) in the assertion of the Saïtic priests. This was denounced\r\nby the Demonologists as illogical. In the ironical words of De Mirville:\r\n\r\n\r\n    A _supercherie_ which was based on a belief, the product of the\r\n    faith of the whole of antiquity; a _supposition_ which yet gave\r\n    its name to a whole mountain chain (Atlas); which specified with\r\n    the greatest precision a topographical region (by placing this\r\n    land at a small distance from Cadiz and the Strait of Calpe),\r\n    which prophesied, 2,000 years before Columbus, _the great\r\n    transoceanic land_ situated beyond that Atlantis and which “is\r\n    reached,” it said, “by the Islands not of the Blessed, but of the\r\n    Good Spirits,” εὐδαιμόνια (our Îles Fortunées)—such a supposition\r\n    can well be nothing else but a _universal chimera_!(843)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is certain that, whether “chimera” or reality, the priests of the whole\r\nworld had it from one and the same source—the universal tradition about\r\nthe third great Continent which perished some 850,000 years ago,(844) a\r\nContinent inhabited by two distinct races, distinct physically and\r\nespecially morally, both deeply versed in primeval wisdom and the secrets\r\nof nature, and mutually antagonistic in their struggle, during the course\r\nand progress of their double evolution. For whence even the Chinese\r\nteachings upon the subject, if it is but a “fiction”? Have they not\r\nrecorded the existence once upon a time of a _Holy_ Island beyond the sun,\r\nTcheou, beyond which were situated the lands of _Immortal_ Men?(845) Do\r\nthey not still believe that the remnants of those Immortal Men—who\r\nsurvived when the Holy Island became black with sin and perished—have\r\nfound refuge in the great Desert of Gobi, where they still reside,\r\ninvisible to all and defended from approach by hosts of Spirits?\r\n\r\nAs the very unbelieving Boulanger writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n    If one has to lend ear to traditions, the latter place before the\r\n    reign of Kings, that of the Heroes and Demi‐gods; and still\r\n    earlier beyond they place the marvellous reign of the Gods and all\r\n    the fables of the Golden Age.... One feels surprised that annals\r\n    so interesting should have been rejected by almost all our\r\n    historians. And yet the ideas presented by them were once\r\n    universally admitted and revered by all nations; not a few revere\r\n    them still, making them the basis of their daily life. Such\r\n    considerations seem to necessitate a less hurried judgment.... The\r\n    ancients, from whom we hold these traditions, which _we accept no\r\n    longer because we no longer understand them_, must have had\r\n    motives for believing in them, furnished by their greater\r\n    proximity to the first ages, which the distance that separates us\r\n    from them refuses to us.... Plato in the fourth book of his\r\n    _Laws_, says that, long before the construction of the first\r\n    cities, Saturn had established on earth a _certain_ form of\r\n    government under which man was very happy. Now as it is the Golden\r\n    Age he refers to, or to that reign of Gods so celebrated in\r\n    ancient fables, ... let us see the ideas he had of that happy age,\r\n    and what was the occasion he had to introduce this _fable_ into a\r\n    treatise on politics. According to Plato, in order to obtain clear\r\n    and precise ideas on royalty, its origin and power, one has to\r\n    turn back to the first principles of history and tradition. Great\r\n    changes, he says, have occurred in days of old, _in heaven and on\r\n    earth_, and the present state of things is one of the results\r\n    [Karma]. Our traditions tell us of many marvels, of changes that\r\n    have taken place in the course of the sun, of Saturn’s reign, and\r\n    of a thousand other matters that remain scattered in human memory;\r\n    but _one never hears anything of the evil which has produced these\r\n    revolutions, nor of the evil which directly followed them_. Yet\r\n    ... that Evil is the principle one has to talk about, to be able\r\n    to treat of royalty and the origin of power.(846)\r\n\r\n\r\nThat Evil, Plato seems to see in the sameness or consubstantiality of the\r\nnatures of the rulers and the ruled, for he says that long before man\r\nbuilt his cities, in the Golden Age, there was naught but happiness on\r\nEarth, for there were no needs. Why? Because Saturn, knowing that man\r\ncould not rule man, without injustice forthwith filling the universe\r\nthrough his whims and vanity, would not allow any mortal to obtain power\r\nover his fellow creatures. To do this the God used the same means we\r\nourselves use with regard to our flocks. We do not place a bullock or a\r\nram over our bullocks and rams, but give them a leader, a shepherd,\r\n_i.e._, _a being of a species quite different from their own and of a\r\nsuperior nature_. This is just what Saturn did. He loved mankind and\r\nplaced to rule over it no mortal king or prince but—“Spirits and Genii\r\n(δαίμονες) of a divine nature more excellent than that of man.”\r\n\r\nIt was God (the Logos, the Synthesis of the Host), who thus presiding over\r\nthe Genii became the first Shepherd and Leader of men.(847) When the world\r\nhad ceased to be so governed and the Gods retired, ferocious beasts\r\ndevoured a portion of mankind. Left to their own resources and industry,\r\nInventors then appeared among them successively and discovered fire,\r\nwheat, wine; and public gratitude deified them.(848)\r\n\r\nAnd mankind was right, as fire by friction was the first mystery of\r\nnature, the first and chief property of matter that was revealed to man.\r\n\r\nAs say the Commentaries:\r\n\r\n_Fruits and grain, unknown to Earth to that day, were brought by the\r\n__“__Lords of Wisdom,__”__ for the benefit of those they ruled from other\r\nLokas [Spheres]._\r\n\r\nNow:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The earliest inventions [?] of mankind are the most wonderful that\r\n    the race has ever made.... The _first use of fire_, and the\r\n    discovery of the methods by which it can be kindled; the\r\n    domestication of animals; and, above all, _the processes by which\r\n    the various cereals were first developed_ out of some wild grasses\r\n    [?]—these are all _discoveries with which, in ingenuity and in\r\n    importance, no subsequent discoveries may compare_. They are all\r\n    unknown to history—all lost in the light of an _effulgent\r\n    dawn_.(849)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis will be doubted and denied in our proud generation. But if it be\r\nasserted that there are no grains and fruits _unknown to earth_, then we\r\nmay remind the reader _that wheat has never been found in the wild state;\r\nit is not a product of the earth_. All the other cereals have been traced\r\nto their primogenital forms in various species of wild grasses, but wheat\r\nhas hitherto defied the efforts of Botanists to trace it to its origin.\r\nAnd let us bear in mind, in this connection, how sacred was this cereal\r\nwith the Egyptian priests; wheat was placed even in their mummies, and has\r\nbeen found thousands of years later in their coffins. Remember how the\r\nservants of Horus glean the wheat in the field of Aanroo, wheat _seven\r\ncubits high_.(850)\r\n\r\nSays the Egyptian Isis:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I am the Queen of these regions; I was the first to reveal to\r\n    mortals the mysteries of wheat and corn.... I am she who rises in\r\n    the constellation of the Dog.... Rejoice, O Egypt! thou who wert\r\n    my nurse.(851)\r\n\r\n\r\nSirius was called the Dog‐star. It was the star of Mercury or Budha,\r\ncalled the great Instructor of Mankind.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese _Y‐King_ attributes the discovery of agriculture to “the\r\ninstruction given to men by celestial genii.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    Woe, woe to the men who know nought, observe nought, nor will they\r\n    see. They are all blind,(852) since they remain ignorant how full\r\n    the world is of various and invisible creatures which crowd even\r\n    in the most sacred places.(853)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “Sons of God” _have_ existed and _do_ exist. From the Hindû\r\nBrahmaputras and Mânasaputras, Sons of Brahmâ and Mind‐born Sons, down to\r\nthe Bne Aleim of the Jewish _Bible_, the faith of the centuries and\r\nuniversal tradition force reason to yield to such evidence. Of what value\r\nis “independent criticism” so‐called, or “internal evidence”—based usually\r\non the respective hobbies of the critics—in the face of the universal\r\ntestimony, which has never varied throughout the historical cycles? For\r\ninstance, read Esoterically the sixth chapter of _Genesis_, which repeats\r\nthe statements of the Secret Doctrine, though slightly changing its form,\r\nand drawing a different conclusion which clashes even with the _Zohar_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    There were giants in the earth in those days; _and also after\r\n    that_, when the sons of God Bne Aleim came in unto the daughters\r\n    of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men\r\n    which were of old, men of renown [or giants].(854)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat does this sentence, “and also after that,” signify unless it means:\r\nThere were Giants in the Earth _before_, _i.e._, before the Sinless Sons\r\nof the Third Race; _and also after that_ when other Sons of God, lower in\r\nnature, inaugurated sexual connection on Earth—as Daksha did, when he saw\r\nthat his Mânasaputras would not people the Earth? And then comes a long\r\nbreak in the chapter between verses 4 and 5. For surely, it was not in or\r\nthrough the wickedness of the “mighty men ... men of renown,” among whom\r\nis placed Nimrod the “mighty hunter before the Lord,” that “God saw that\r\nthe wickedness of man was great,” nor in the builders of Babel, for this\r\nwas _after_ the Deluge; but in the progeny of the Giants who produced\r\n_monstra quædam de genere giganteo_, monsters from whence sprang the lower\r\nraces of men, now represented on Earth by a few miserable dying‐out tribes\r\nand the huge anthropoid apes.\r\n\r\nAnd if we are taken to task by Theologians, whether Protestant or Roman\r\nCatholic, we have only to refer them to their own literal texts. The above\r\nquoted verse has ever been a dilemma, not alone for the men of Science and\r\nbiblical scholars, but also for priests. For, as the Rev. Father Péronne\r\nputs it:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Either they (the Bne Aleim) were good Angels, and in such case how\r\n    could they fall? Or they were bad (Angels), and in that case could\r\n    not be called Bne Aleim, or sons of God.(855)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis biblical riddle—“the real sense of which no author has ever\r\nunderstood,” as is candidly confessed by Fourmont(856)—can only be\r\nexplained by the Occult doctrine, through the _Zohar_ to the Western, and\r\nthe _Book of Dzyan_ to the Eastern. What the latter says we have seen;\r\nwhat the _Zohar_ tells us is that Bne Aleim was a name common to the\r\nMalachim, the good Messengers, and to the Ischins, the lower Angels.(857)\r\n\r\nWe may add for the benefit of the Demonologists that their Satan, the\r\n“Adversary,” is included in _Job_ among the “sons” of God or Bne Aleim who\r\nvisit their father.(858) But of this later on.\r\n\r\nNow the _Zohar_ says that the Ischins, the beautiful Bne Aleim, were _not_\r\nguilty, but mixed _themselves with mortal men because they were sent on\r\nearth to do so_.(859) Elsewhere the same volume shows these Bne Aleim\r\nbelonging to the tenth sub‐division of the “Thrones.”(860) It also\r\nexplains that the Ischins—“Men‐spirits,” _viri spirituales_(861)—now that\r\nmen can see them no longer, help Magicians to produce, by their Science,\r\nHomunculi which are not “small men” but “men _smaller_ (in the sense of\r\ninferiority) than men.” Both show themselves under the form that the\r\nIschins had then, _i.e._, gaseous and ethereal. Their chief is Azazel.\r\n\r\nBut Azazel, whom the Church dogma persists in associating with Satan, is\r\nnothing of the kind. Azazel is a _mystery_, as explained elsewhere, and it\r\nis so expressed by Maimonides:\r\n\r\n\r\n    There is an impenetrable mystery in the narrative concerning\r\n    Azazel.(862)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so there is, as Lanci, a librarian to the Vatican, whom we have quoted\r\nbefore, and one who ought to know, says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    This venerable divine name (_nome divino e venerabile_) has become\r\n    through the pen of biblical scholars, a devil, a wilderness, a\r\n    mountain, and a he‐goat.(863)\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore it seems foolish to derive the name, as Spencer does, from Azal\r\n(separated) and El (God), hence “one separated from God”—the Devil. In the\r\n_Zohar_, Azazel is rather the “sacrificial victim” than the “formal\r\nadversary of Jehovah,” as Spencer would have it.(864)\r\n\r\nThe amount of malicious fancy and fiction bestowed on this “Host” by\r\nvarious fanatical writers is quite extraordinary. Azazel and his “Host”\r\nare simply the Hebrew “Prometheus,” and ought to be viewed from the same\r\nstandpoint. The _Zohar_ shows the Ischins chained to the mountain in the\r\ndesert. This is allegorical, and simply alludes to these “Spirits” as\r\nbeing chained to the Earth during the Cycle of Incarnation. Azazel, or\r\nAzazyel, is one of the chiefs of the “transgressing” Angels in the _Book\r\nof Enoch_, who descending upon Ardis, the top of Mount Armon, bound\r\nthemselves by swearing loyalty to each other. It is said that Azazyel\r\ntaught men to make swords, knives, shields, to fabricate mirrors (?), to\r\nmake _one see what is behind him_—viz., “magic mirrors.” Amazarak taught\r\nall the sorcerers and dividers of roots; Amers taught the solution of\r\nMagic; Barkayal, Astrology; Akibeel, the meaning of portents and signs;\r\nTamiel, Astronomy; and Asaradel taught the motion of the Moon.(865) “These\r\nseven were the first instructors of the fourth man” (_i.e._, of the Fourth\r\nRace). But why should allegory be always understood as meaning just what\r\nits dead‐letter expresses?\r\n\r\nIt is the symbolical representation of the great struggle between Divine\r\nWisdom, Nous, and its Earthly Reflection, Psyche, or between Spirit and\r\nSoul, in Heaven and on Earth. In Heaven—because the Divine Monad had\r\nvoluntarily exiled itself therefrom, to descend, for incarnating purposes,\r\nto a lower plane and thus transform the _animal_ of clay into an immortal\r\n_God_. For, as Éliphas Lévi tells us:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Angels aspire to become Men; for the perfect Man, the Man‐God,\r\n    is above even Angels.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Earth—because no sooner had Spirit descended than it was strangled in\r\nthe coils of Matter.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, the Occult Teaching reverses the characters; it is the\r\nanthropomorphous Archangel in the case of the Christians, and the man‐like\r\nGod with the Hindûs, which represent Matter in this case; and the Dragon,\r\nor Serpent, Spirit. Occult symbolism furnishes the key to the mystery;\r\ntheological symbolism conceals it still more. For the former explains many\r\na saying in the _Bible_ and even in the _New Testament_ which has hitherto\r\nremained incomprehensible; while the latter, owing to its dogma of Satan\r\nand his rebellion, has belittled the character and nature of its would‐be\r\ninfinite, absolutely perfect God, and created the greatest evil and curse\r\non Earth—belief in a personal Devil. This mystery is now partially\r\nrevealed. The key to its metaphysical interpretation has now been\r\nrestored, while the key to its theological interpretation shows the Gods\r\nand Archangels standing as symbols for the dead‐letter or dogmatic\r\nreligions, as arrayed against the pure truths of Spirit, naked and\r\nunadorned with fancy.\r\n\r\nMany were the hints thrown out in this direction in _Isis Unveiled_, and a\r\nstill greater number of references to the mystery may be found scattered\r\nthroughout these volumes. To make the point clear once for all; that which\r\nthe clergy of every dogmatic religion, preëminently the Christian, points\r\nout as Satan, the enemy of God, is, in reality, the highest divine\r\nSpirit—Occult Wisdom on Earth—which is naturally antagonistic to every\r\nworldly, evanescent illusion, dogmatic or ecclesiastical religions\r\nincluded. Thus, the Latin Church, intolerant, bigoted and cruel to all who\r\ndo not choose to be its slaves, the Church which calls itself the “bride”\r\nof Christ, and at the same time the trustee of Peter, to whom the rebuke\r\nof the Master “Get thee behind me, Satan” was justly addressed; and again\r\nthe Protestant Church which, while calling itself Christian, paradoxically\r\nreplaces the New Dispensation by the old Law of Moses which Christ openly\r\nrepudiated—both these Churches are fighting against divine Truth, when\r\nrepudiating and slandering the Dragon of Esoteric Divine Wisdom. Whenever\r\nthey anathematize the Gnostic Solar Chnouphis, the Agathodæmon Christos,\r\nor the Theosophical Serpent of Eternity, or even the Serpent of\r\n_Genesis_—they are moved by the same spirit of dark fanaticism that moved\r\nthe Pharisees to curse Jesus with the words: “Say we not well thou hast a\r\ndevil?”\r\n\r\nRead the account of Indra (Vâyu) in the _Rig Veda_, the Occult volume _par\r\nexcellence_ of Âryanism, and then compare it with the same in the\r\n_Purânas_—the exoteric version thereof, and the purposely garbled account\r\nof the true Wisdom Religion. In the _Rig Veda_, Indra is the highest and\r\ngreatest of the Gods, and his Soma‐drinking is allegorical of his highly\r\nspiritual nature. In the _Purânas_, Indra becomes a profligate, and a\r\nregular drunkard on the Soma‐juice, in the ordinary terrestrial way. He is\r\nthe conqueror of all the “enemies of the Gods” the Daityas, Nâgas\r\n(Serpents), Asuras, all the Serpent‐gods, and of Vritra, the Cosmic\r\nSerpent. Indra is the St. Michael of the Hindû Pantheon—the chief of the\r\n_militant_ Host. Turning to the _Bible_, we find Satan, one of the “Sons\r\nof God,”(866) becoming in exoteric interpretation the Devil, and the\r\nDragon, in its infernal, evil sense. But in the _Kabalah_,(867) Samael,\r\nwho is Satan, is shown to be identical with St. Michael, the Slayer of the\r\nDragon. How is this, when it is said that Tselem (the Image) reflects\r\nalike Michael and Samael, _who are one_? Both proceed, it is taught, from\r\nRuach (Spirit), Neshamah (Soul) and Nephesh (Life). In the Chaldæan _Book\r\nof Numbers_ Samael is the concealed (Occult) Wisdom, and Michael the\r\nhigher _terrestrial_ Wisdom, both emanating from the same source, but\r\ndiverging after their issue from the Mundane Soul, which on Earth is\r\nMahat, intellectual understanding, or Manas, the seat of intellect. They\r\ndiverge, because the one (Michael) is _influenced_ by Neshamah, while the\r\nother (Samael) remains _uninfluenced_. This tenet was perverted by the\r\ndogmatic spirit of the Church, which, loathing independent Spirit,\r\nuninfluenced by the external form, hence by dogma, forthwith made of\r\nSamael‐Satan—the most wise and spiritual spirit of all—the Adversary of\r\nits anthropomorphic God and sensual physical man, the Devil!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Origin Of The Satanic Myth.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us, then, fathom this creation of the Patristic fancy still deeper,\r\nand find its prototype with the Pagans. The origin of the new Satanic myth\r\nis easy to trace. The tradition of the Dragon and the Sun is echoed in\r\nevery part of the world, both in its civilized and semi‐savage regions. It\r\ntook rise in the whisperings about secret Initiations among the profane,\r\nand was once universally established through the formerly universal\r\nheliolatrous religion. There was a time when the four parts of the world\r\nwere covered with the temples sacred to the Sun and the Dragon; but the\r\ncult is now preserved mostly in China and Buddhist countries,\r\n\r\n\r\n    Bel and the Dragon being uniformly coupled together, and the\r\n    priest of the Ophite religion as uniformly assuming the name of\r\n    his God.(868)\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the religions of the past, it is in Egypt we have to seek for its\r\nWestern origin. The Ophites adopted their rites from Hermes Trismegistus,\r\nand heliolatrous worship with its Sun‐gods crossed over into the land of\r\nthe Pharaohs from India. In the Gods of Stonehenge we recognize the\r\ndivinities of Delphi and Babylon, and in those of the latter the Devas of\r\nthe Vedic nations. Bel and the Dragon, Apollo and Python, Krishna and\r\nKâliya, Osiris and Typhon, are all one under many names—the latest of\r\nwhich are Michael and the Red Dragon, and St. George and his Dragon. As\r\nMichael is “one as God,” or his “Double” for terrestrial purposes, and is\r\none of the Elohim, the fighting Angel, he is thus simply a permutation of\r\nJehovah. Whatever the cosmic or astronomical event that first gave rise to\r\nthe allegory of the “War in Heaven,” its earthly origin has to be sought\r\nin the temples of Initiation and archaic crypts; and the proof is that we\r\nfind (_a_) the priests assuming the name of the Gods they served; (_b_)\r\nthe “Dragons” held throughout all antiquity as the symbols of Immortality\r\nand Wisdom, of secret Knowledge and of Eternity; and (_c_) the Hierophants\r\nof Egypt, of Babylon, and India, styling themselves generally the “Sons of\r\nthe Dragon” and “Serpents”; thus corroborating the teachings of the Secret\r\nDoctrine.\r\n\r\nThere were numerous catacombs in Egypt and Chaldæa, some of them of a very\r\nvast extent. The most renowned of these were the subterranean crypts of\r\nThebes and Memphis. The former, beginning on the western side of the Nile,\r\nextended towards the Libyan desert, and were known as the Serpent’s\r\nCatacombs, or passages. It was there that were performed the Sacred\r\nMysteries of the Kuklos Anagkês, the “Unavoidable Cycle,” more generally\r\nknown as the “Circle of Necessity”; the inexorable doom imposed upon every\r\nSoul after bodily death, when it has been judged in the Amentian region.\r\n\r\nIn De Bourbourg’s book, Votan, the Mexican Demi‐god, in narrating his\r\nexpedition, describes a subterranean passage which ran on underground, and\r\nterminated at the root of the heavens, adding that this passage was a\r\nSnake’s hole, “_un agujero de colubra_”; and that he was admitted to it\r\nbecause he was himself a “Son of the Snakes,” or a Serpent.(869)\r\n\r\nThis is, indeed, very suggestive; for his description of the “Snake’s\r\nhole” is that of the ancient Egyptian crypt, as above mentioned. The\r\nHierophants, moreover, of Egypt, and also of Babylon, generally styled\r\nthemselves during the Mysteries, the “Sons of the Serpent‐god,” or “Sons\r\nof the Dragon.”\r\n\r\n“The Assyrian priest always bore the name of his God,” says Movers. The\r\nDruids of the Celto‐Britannic regions also called themselves Snakes. “I am\r\na Serpent, I am a Druid,” they exclaimed. The Egyptian Karnak is twin\r\nbrother to the Carnac of Bretagne, the latter Carnac meaning the Serpent’s\r\nMount. The Dracontia once covered the surface of the globe, and these\r\ntemples were sacred to the Dragon, only because it was the symbol of the\r\nSun, which, in its turn, was the symbol of the Highest God—the Phœnician\r\nElon or Elion, whom Abraham recognized as El Elion.(870) Besides the\r\nsurname of Serpents, they had also the appellation of “Builders” or\r\n“Architects,” for the immense grandeur of their temples and monuments was\r\nsuch that even now the pulverized remains of them “frighten the\r\nmathematical calculations of our modern engineers,” as Taliesin says.(871)\r\n\r\nDe Bourbourg hints that the chiefs of the name of Votan, the Quetzo‐\r\nCohuatl, or Serpent deity of the Mexicans, are the descendants of Ham and\r\nCanaan. “I am Hivim,” they say. “Being a Hivim, I am of the great race of\r\nthe Dragon (Snake). I am a Snake myself, for I am a Hivim.”(872)\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the “War in Heaven” is shown, in one of its significations,\r\nto have referred to those terrible struggles in store for the Candidate\r\nfor Adeptship—struggles between himself and his (by Magic) personified\r\nhuman passions, when the enlightened _Inner Man_ had to either slay them\r\nor fail. In the former case he became the “Dragon‐Slayer,” as having\r\nhappily overcome all the temptations, and a “Son of the Serpent” and a\r\nSerpent himself, having cast off his old skin and being born in a _new_\r\nbody, becoming a Son of Wisdom and Immortality in Eternity.\r\n\r\nSeth, the reputed forefather of Israel, is only a Jewish travesty of\r\nHermes, the God of Wisdom, called also Thoth, Tat, Seth, Set, and Satan.\r\nHe is also Typhon, the same as Apophis, the Dragon slain by Horus; for\r\nTyphon was also called Set. He is simply the _dark side_ of Osiris, his\r\nbrother, as Angra Mainyu is the black shadow of Ahura Mazda.\r\nTerrestrially, all these allegories were connected with the trials of\r\nAdeptship and Initiation. Astronomically, they referred to the Solar and\r\nLunar eclipses, the mythical explanations of which we find to this day in\r\nIndia and Ceylon, where anyone can study the allegorical narratives and\r\ntraditions which have remained unchanged for many thousands of years.\r\n\r\nRâhu, mythologically, is a Daitya—a Giant, a Demi‐god, the lower part of\r\nwhose body ended in a Dragon’s or Serpent’s tail. During the Churning of\r\nthe Ocean, when the Gods produced the Amrita, the Water of Immortality, he\r\nstole some of it, and, drinking, became immortal. The Sun and Moon, who\r\nhad detected him in his theft, denounced him to Vishnu, who placed him in\r\nthe stellar spheres, the upper portion of his body representing the\r\nDragon’s head and the lower (Ketu) the Dragon’s tail; the two being the\r\nascending and descending nodes. Since then, Râhu wreaks his vengeance on\r\nthe Sun and Moon by occasionally swallowing them. But this fable has\r\nanother mystic meaning, for Râhu, the Dragon’s head, played a prominent\r\npart in the Mysteries of the Sun’s (Vikartana’s) Initiation, when the\r\nCandidate and the Dragon had a supreme fight.\r\n\r\nThe caves of the Rishis, the abodes of Teiresias and the Greek seers, were\r\nmodelled on those of the Nâgas—the Hindû King‐Snakes, who dwelt in\r\ncavities of the rocks under the ground. From Shesha, the thousand‐headed\r\nSerpent, on which Vishnu rests, down to Python, the Dragon‐serpent oracle,\r\nall point to the secret meaning of the myth. In India we find the fact\r\nmentioned in the earliest _Purânas_. The children of Surasâ are the mighty\r\n“Dragons.” The _Vâyu Purâna_ replacing the “Dragons” of Surasâ of the\r\n_Vishnu Purâna_ by the Dânavas, the descendants of Danu by the sage\r\nKashyapa, and these Dânavas being the Giants, or Titans, who warred\r\nagainst the Gods, they are thus shown identical with the “Dragons” and\r\n“Serpents” of Wisdom.\r\n\r\nWe have only to compare the Sun‐gods of every country, to find their\r\nallegories agreeing perfectly with each other; and the more the\r\nallegorical symbol is Occult the more its corresponding symbol in exoteric\r\nsystems agrees with it. Thus, if from three systems widely differing from\r\neach other in appearance—the old Âryan, the ancient Greek, and the modern\r\nChristian schemes—several Sun‐gods and Dragons are selected at random,\r\nthey will be found to be copied from each other.\r\n\r\nLet us take Agni the Fire‐god, Indra the firmament, and Kârttikeya from\r\nthe Hindûs; the Greek Apollo; and Michael, the “Angel of the Sun,” the\r\nfirst of the Æons, called by the Gnostics the “Saviour”—and proceed in\r\norder.\r\n\r\n(1) Agni, the Fire‐god, is called Vaishvânara in the _Rig Veda_. Now\r\nVaishvânara is a Dânava, a Giant‐demon,(873) whose daughters Pulomâ and\r\nKâlakâ are the mothers of numberless Dânavas (30 millions), by\r\nKashyapa,(874) and live in Hiranyapura, “_the golden city, floating in the\r\nair_.”(875) Therefore, Indra is, in a fashion, the step‐son of these two\r\nas a son of Kashyapa; and Kashyapa is, in this sense, identical with Agni,\r\nthe Fire‐god, or Sun (Kashyapa‐Âditya). To this same group belongs Skanda\r\nor Kârttikeya, God of War, the _six‐faced_ planet Mars astronomically, a\r\nKumâra, or Virgin‐youth, born of Agni,(876) for the purpose of destroying\r\nTâraka, the Dânava Demon, the grandson of Kashyapa by his son\r\nHiranyâksha.(877) Târaka’s Yoga austerities were so extraordinary that\r\nthey became formidable to the Gods, who feared such a rival in power.(878)\r\nWhile Indra, the bright God of the Firmament, kills Vritra, or Ahi, the\r\nSerpent‐Demon—for which feat he is called Vritra‐han, the “Destroyer of\r\nVritra”—he also leads the hosts of Devas (Angels or Gods) against other\r\nGods who rebel against Brahmâ, for which he is surnamed Jishnu, “Leader of\r\nthe Celestial Host.” Kârttikeya is also found bearing the same titles. For\r\nkilling Târaka, the Dânava, he is called Târaka‐jit, “Vanquisher of\r\nTâraka,”(879) Kumâra Guha, the “mysterious Virgin‐youth,” Siddha‐sena,\r\n“Leader of the Siddhas,” and Shakti‐dhara, “Spear‐holder.”\r\n\r\n(2) Now take Apollo, the Grecian Sun‐god, and by comparing the mythical\r\naccounts given of him, see whether he does not answer both to Indra,\r\nKârttikeya, and even Kashyapa‐Âditya, and at the same time to Michael (as\r\nthe Angelic form of Jehovah) the “Angel of the Sun,” who is “like,” and\r\n“one with, God.” Later ingenious interpretations for monotheistic\r\npurposes, elevated though they be into not‐to‐be‐questioned Church dogmas,\r\nprove nothing, except, perhaps, the abuse of human authority and power.\r\n\r\nApollo is Helios, the Sun, Phoibos‐Apollo, the “Light of Life and of the\r\nWorld,”(880) who arises out of the Golden‐winged Cup (the Sun); hence he\r\nis the Sun‐god _par excellence_. At the moment of his birth he asks for\r\nhis bow to kill Python, the Demon Dragon, who attacked his mother before\r\nhis birth,(881) and whom he is divinely commissioned to destroy—like\r\nKârttikeya, who is born for the purpose of killing Târaka, the _too holy\r\nand wise_ Demon. Apollo is born on a sidereal island called Asteria—the\r\n“golden star island,” the “earth which floats in the air,” which is the\r\nHindû golden Hiranyapura; he is called the Pure (ἁγνὸς) Agnus Dei, the\r\nIndian Agni, as Dr. Kenealy thinks; and in the primal myth he is exempt\r\n“from all sensual love.”(882) He is, therefore, a Kumâra, like Kârttikeya,\r\nand as Indra was in his earlier life and biographies. Python, moreover,\r\nthe “red Dragon,” connects Apollo with Michael, who fights the Apocalyptic\r\nDragon, seeking to attack the woman in child‐birth, as Python attacks\r\nApollo’s mother. Can any one fail to see the identity? Had the Rt. Hon. W.\r\nE. Gladstone, who prides himself on his Greek scholarship and\r\nunderstanding of the spirit of Homer’s allegories, ever had a real inkling\r\nof the _esoteric_ meaning of the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_, he would have\r\nunderstood St. John’s _Revelation_, and even the _Pentateuch_, better than\r\nhe does. For the way to the _Bible_ lies through Hermes, Bel, and Homer,\r\nas the way to these is through the Hindû and Chaldæan religious symbols.\r\n\r\n(3) The repetition of this archaic tradition is found in chapter xii of\r\nSt. John’s _Revelation_, and comes from the Babylonian legends, without\r\nthe smallest doubt, though the Babylonian story, in its turn, had its\r\norigin in the allegories of the Âryans. The fragment read by the late\r\nGeorge Smith is sufficient to disclose the source of this chapter of the\r\nApocalypse. Here it is as given by the eminent Assyriologist:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Our ... fragment refers to the creation of mankind, called Adam,\r\n    as [the man] in the Bible; he is made perfect, ... but afterwards\r\n    he joins with the dragon of the deep, the animal of Tiamat, the\r\n    spirit of chaos, and offends against his god, who _curses him_,\r\n    and calls down on his head all the evils and troubles of\r\n    humanity.(883)\r\n\r\n    This is followed by a war between the dragon and the powers of\r\n    evil, or chaos on one side and the gods on the other.\r\n\r\n    The gods have weapons forged for them,(884) and Merodach [the\r\n    Archangel Michael in _Revelation_] undertakes to lead the heavenly\r\n    host against the dragon. The war, which is described with spirit,\r\n    ends of course in the triumph of the principles of good.(885)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis War of the Gods with the Powers of the Deep, refers also, in its last\r\nand terrestrial application, to the struggle between the Âryan Adepts of\r\nthe nascent Fifth Race and the Sorcerers of Atlantis, the Demons of the\r\nDeep, the Islanders surrounded with water who disappeared in the Deluge.\r\n\r\nThe symbols of the “Dragon” and “War in Heaven” have, as already stated,\r\nmore than one significance; religious, astronomical and geological events\r\nbeing included in the one common allegory. But they had also a\r\ncosmological meaning. In India the Dragon story is repeated in one of its\r\nforms in the battles of Indra with Vritra. In the _Vedas_ this Ahi‐Vritra\r\nis referred to as the Demon of Drought, the terrible hot Wind. Indra is\r\nshown to be constantly at war with him; and with the help of his thunder\r\nand lightning the God compels Ahi‐Vritra to pour down in rain on Earth,\r\nand then slays him. Hence, Indra is called the Vritra‐han or the “Slayer\r\nof Vritra,” as Michael is called the Conqueror and “Slayer of the Dragon.”\r\nBoth these “Enemies” are then the “Old Dragon” precipitated into the\r\ndepths of the Earth, in this one sense.\r\n\r\nThe Avestaic Amshaspands are a Host with a leader like St. Michael over\r\nthem, and seem identical with the legions of Heaven, to judge from the\r\naccount in the _Vendîdâd_. Thus in Fargard xix, Zarathushtra is told by\r\nAhura Mazda to “invoke the Amesha Spentas who rule over the seven\r\nKarshvares(886) of the Earth”;(887) which Karshvares in their seven\r\napplications refer equally to the seven Spheres of our Planetary Chain, to\r\nthe seven Planets, the seven Heavens, etc., according to whether the sense\r\nis applied to a physical, supra‐mundane, or simply a sidereal World. In\r\nthe same Fargard, in his invocation against Angra Mainyu and his Host,\r\nZarathushtra appeals to them in these words: “I invoke the seven bright\r\nSravah with their sons and their flocks.”(888) The “Sravah”—a word which\r\nthe Orientalists have given up as one “of unknown meaning”—means the same\r\nAmshaspands, but in their highest Occult meaning. The Sravah are the\r\nNoumenoi of the phenomenal Amshaspands, the Souls or Spirits of those\r\n_manifested_ Powers; and “their sons and their flocks” refer to the\r\nPlanetary Angels and their sidereal flocks of stars and constellations.\r\n“Amshaspand” is the exoteric term used in terrestrial combinations and\r\naffairs only. Zarathushtra addresses Ahura Mazda constantly as the “maker\r\nof the _material_ world.” Ormazd is the father of our Earth (Spenta\r\nÂrmaiti), who is referred to, when personified, as “the fair daughter of\r\nAhura Mazda,”(889) who is also the creator of the Tree (of Occult and\r\nSpiritual Knowledge and Wisdom) from which the mystic and mysterious\r\nBaresma is taken. But the Occult name of the bright God was never\r\npronounced outside the temple.\r\n\r\nSamael or Satan the seducing Serpent of _Genesis_, and one of the primeval\r\nAngels who rebelled, is the name of the “Red Dragon.” He is the Angel of\r\nDeath, for the _Talmud_ says that “the Angel of Death and Satan are the\r\nsame.” He is killed by Michael, and once more killed by St. George, who\r\nalso is a Dragon Slayer. But see the transformations of this. Samael is\r\nidentical with the Simoom, the hot wind of the desert, or again with the\r\nVedic Demon of Drought, as Vritra. “Simoon is called Atabutos”\r\nor—Diabolos, the Devil.\r\n\r\nTyphon, or the Dragon Apophis—the Accuser in the _Book of the Dead_—is\r\nworsted by Horus, who pierces his opponent’s head with a spear; and Typhon\r\nis the all‐destroying wind of the desert, the rebellious element that\r\nthrows everything into confusion. As Set, he is the darkness of night, the\r\nmurderer of Osiris, who is the light of day and the Sun. Archæology\r\ndemonstrates that Horus is identical with Anubis,(890) whose effigy was\r\ndiscovered upon an Egyptian monument, with a cuirass and a spear, like\r\nMichael and St. George. Anubis is also represented as slaying a Dragon,\r\nthat has the head and tail of a serpent.(891)\r\n\r\nCosmologically, then, all the Dragons and Serpents conquered by their\r\n“Slayers” are, in their origin, the turbulent confused principles in\r\nChaos, brought to order by the Sun‐gods or _Creative_ Powers. In the _Book\r\nof the Dead_ those principles are called the “Sons of Rebellion.”(892)\r\n\r\n\r\n    In that night, the oppressor, the murderer of Osiris, otherwise\r\n    called the _deceiving Serpent_ ... calls the Sons of Rebellion in\r\n    _Air_, and when they arrive to the East of the Heavens, then there\r\n    is War in Heaven and in the entire World.(893)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Scandinavian _Eddas_ the “War” of the Ases with the Hrimthurses or\r\nFrost giants, and of Asathor with the Jotuns, the Serpents and Dragons and\r\nthe “Wolf” who comes out of “Darkness”—is the repetition of the same myth.\r\nThe “Evil Spirits,”(894) who began by being simply the emblems of Chaos,\r\nhave become euhemerized by the superstition of the rabble, until they have\r\nfinally won the right of citizenship in what are claimed to be the most\r\ncivilized and learned races of this globe _since its creation_, and have\r\nbecome a dogma with Christians. As George Smith has it:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The evil principles [Spirits], emblems of Chaos [in Chaldæa and\r\n    Assyria as in Egypt, we see], ... resist this change and make war\r\n    on the Moon, the eldest son of Bel, drawing over to their side the\r\n    Sun, Venus and the atmospheric god Vul.(895)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is only another version of the Hindû “War in Heaven,” between Soma,\r\nthe Moon, and the Gods; Indra being the atmospheric Vul—which shows it\r\nplainly to be both a cosmogonical and an astronomical allegory, woven into\r\nand drawn from the earliest Theogony as taught in the Mysteries.\r\n\r\nIt is in the religious doctrines of the Gnostics that we can best see the\r\nreal meaning of the Dragon, the Serpent, the Goat, and all those symbols\r\nof Powers now called Evil; for it is they who, in their teachings,\r\ndivulged the Esoteric nature of the Jewish substitute for Ain Suph, the\r\ntrue meaning of which the Rabbins concealed, while the Christians, with a\r\nfew exceptions, knew nothing of it. Surely Jesus of Nazareth would have\r\nhardly advised his apostles to show themselves as _wise_ as the serpent,\r\nhad the latter been a symbol of the Evil One; nor would the Ophites, the\r\nlearned Egyptian Gnostics of the “Brotherhood of the Serpent,” have\r\nreverenced a living snake in their ceremonies as the emblem of _Wisdom_,\r\nthe divine Sophia, and a type of the All‐good, not the All‐bad, were that\r\nreptile so closely connected with Satan. The fact is, that even as a\r\ncommon ophidian it has ever been a dual symbol, and as a dragon it has\r\nnever been anything else than a symbol of the Manifested Deity in its\r\ngreat Wisdom. The _draco volans_, the “flying dragon” of the early\r\npainters, may be an exaggerated picture of the real extinct antediluvian\r\nanimal, and those who have faith in the Occult Teachings believe that in\r\nthe days of old there were such creatures as flying dragons, a kind of\r\nPterodactyl, and that it is those gigantic winged lizards that served as\r\nprototypes for the Seraph of Moses and his great Brazen Serpent.(896) The\r\nJews formerly worshipped the latter _idol_ themselves, but, after the\r\nreligious reforms brought about by Hezekiah, they turned round, and called\r\nthat symbol of the Great or Higher God of every other nation a Devil, and\r\ntheir own usurper—the “One God.”(897)\r\n\r\nThe appellation Sa’tan, in Hebrew Sâtân, an “Adversary” (from the verb\r\n_shatana_, “to be adverse,” “to persecute”) belongs by right to the first\r\nand cruellest “Adversary” _of all the other Gods_—Jehovah; not to the\r\nSerpent, which spoke only words of sympathy and wisdom, and is at the\r\nworst, even in the dogma, the “Adversary” _of men_. This dogma, based as\r\nit is on the third chapter of _Genesis_, is as illogical and unjust as it\r\nis paradoxical. For who was the first to _create_ that original and\r\nhenceforward universal tempter of man—the woman? Not the Serpent surely,\r\nbut the “Lord God” himself, who, saying, “It is not good that the man\r\nshould be alone,” made woman, and “brought her unto the man.”(898) If the\r\nunpleasant little incident that followed _was_ and is still to be regarded\r\nas the “original sin,” then it exhibits the Creator’s divine foresight in\r\na poor light indeed. It would have been far better for the first Adam of\r\nthe first chapter to have been left either “male and female,” or “alone.”\r\nIt is the Lord God, evidently, who was the real cause of all the mischief,\r\nthe “_agent provocateur_,” and the Serpent—only a prototype of Azazel,\r\n“the scapegoat for the sin of [the God of] Israel,” the poor Tragos having\r\nto pay the penalty for his Master’s and Creator’s blunder. This, of\r\ncourse, is addressed only to those who accept the opening events of the\r\ndrama of humanity in _Genesis_ in their dead‐letter sense. Those who read\r\nthem Esoterically, are not reduced to fanciful speculations and\r\nhypotheses; they _know_ how to read the symbolism therein contained, and\r\ncannot err.\r\n\r\nThere is at present no need to touch upon the mystic and manifold meaning\r\nof the name Jehovah in its abstract sense, one independent of the Deity\r\nfalsely called by that name. It was a “blind” purposely created by the\r\nRabbins, a secret preserved by them with ten‐fold care after the\r\nChristians had despoiled them of this God‐name which was their own\r\nproperty.(899) The following statement, however, is now made. The\r\npersonage who is named in the first four chapters of _Genesis_ variously\r\nas “God,” the “Lord God,” and “Lord” simply, is not one and the same\r\nperson; certainly it is not Jehovah. There are three distinct classes or\r\ngroups of the Elohim called Sephiroth in the _Kabalah_. Jehovah appears\r\nonly in chapter iv of _Genesis_, in the first verse of which he is named\r\nCain, and in the last transformed into _mankind_—male and female, Jah‐\r\nveh.(900) The Serpent, moreover, is not Satan, but the bright Angel, one\r\nof the Elohim clothed in radiance and glory, who—promising the woman, if\r\nthey ate of the forbidden fruit, “ye shall not surely die”—kept his\r\npromise, and made man immortal in his _incorruptible nature_. He is the\r\nIao of the Mysteries, the chief of the Androgyne Creators of men. Chapter\r\niii contains (Esoterically) the withdrawal of the veil of ignorance that\r\nclosed the perceptions of the Angelic Man, made in the image of the\r\n“boneless” Gods, and the opening of his consciousness to his real nature;\r\nthus showing the Bright Angel (Lucifer) in the light of a giver of\r\nImmortality, and as the “Enlightener”; while the real Fall into generation\r\nand matter is to be sought in chapter iv. There, Jehovah‐Cain, the male\r\npart of Adam the _dual_ man, having separated himself from Eve, creates in\r\nher Abel, _the first natural woman_,(901) and sheds the _virgin blood_.\r\nNow Cain, being shown identical with Jehovah, on the authority of the\r\ncorrect reading of the first verse of chapter iv of _Genesis_, in the\r\noriginal Hebrew text, and the Rabbins teaching that “Kin (Cain) the Evil\r\nwas the Son of Eve by Samael, the Devil, who occupied the place of\r\nAdam,”(902) and the _Talmud_ adding that “the evil Spirit, Satan, and\r\nSamael, the angel of Death, are the same”(903)—it becomes easy to see that\r\nJehovah (mankind, or Jah‐hovah) and Satan (therefore the tempting Serpent)\r\nare one and the same in every particular. _There is no Devil, no Evil\r\noutside mankind to produce a Devil._ Evil is a necessity in, and one of\r\nthe supporters of the Manifested Universe. It is a necessity for progress\r\nand evolution, as night is necessary for the production of day, and death\r\nfor that of life—_that man may live for ever_.\r\n\r\nSatan represents metaphysically simply the _reverse_ or the _polar\r\nopposite_ of everything in Nature.(904) He is the “Adversary,”\r\nallegorically, the “Murderer,” and the great Enemy of _all_, because there\r\nis nothing in the whole Universe that has not two sides—the reverses of\r\nthe same medal. But in that case, light, goodness, beauty, etc., may be\r\ncalled Satan with as much propriety as the Devil, since they are the\r\nAdversaries of darkness, badness, and ugliness. And now the philosophy and\r\nthe _rationale_ of certain early Christian sects—called _heretical_ and\r\nviewed as the abomination of the times—will become more comprehensible. We\r\nmay understand how it was that the sect of Satanians came to be degraded,\r\nand were anathematized without any hope of vindication in a future day,\r\nsince they kept their tenets secret. How, on the same principle, the\r\nCainites came to be degraded, and even the (Judas) Iscariotes; the true\r\ncharacter of the _treacherous_ apostle having never been correctly\r\npresented before the tribunal of humanity.\r\n\r\nAs a direct consequence, the tenets of the Gnostic sects also become\r\nclear. Each of these sects was founded by an Initiate, while their tenets\r\nwere based on the correct knowledge of the symbolism of every nation. Thus\r\nit becomes comprehensible why Ilda‐baoth was regarded by most of them as\r\nthe God of Moses, and was held to be a proud, ambitious, and impure\r\nSpirit, who had abused his power by usurping the place of the Highest God,\r\nthough he was no better, and in some respects far worse than his brother\r\nElohim; the latter representing the all‐embracing, manifested Deity only\r\nin their collectivity, since they were the Fashioners of the first\r\ndifferentiations of the primary Cosmic Substance for the creation of the\r\nphenomenal Universe. Therefore Jehovah was called by the Gnostics the\r\nCreator of, and one with, Ophiomorphos, the Serpent, Satan, or Evil.(905)\r\nThey taught that Iurbo and Adonai were names of Iao‐Jehovah, who is an\r\nemanation of Ilda‐baoth.(906) This, in their language, amounted to saying\r\nwhat the Rabbins expressed in a more veiled way, by stating that “Cain had\r\nbeen generated by Samael or Satan.”\r\n\r\nThe Fallen Angels, in every ancient system, are made the prototypes of\r\n_fallen_ men—allegorically, and _those men themselves_—Esoterically. Thus\r\nthe Elohim of the hour of creation became the Beni‐Elohim, the Sons of\r\nGod, among whom is Satan, in the Semitic traditions. War in Heaven between\r\nThrætaona and Azhi‐dahaka, the destroying Serpent, ends on Earth,\r\naccording to Burnouf, in the battle of pious men against the power of\r\nEvil, “of the Iranians with the Âryan Brâhmans of India.” And the conflict\r\nof the Gods with the Asuras is repeated in the Great War—the Mahâbhârata.\r\nIn the latest religion of all, Christianity, all the combatants, Gods and\r\nDemons, Adversaries in both the camps, are now transformed into Dragons\r\nand Satans, simply in order to connect Evil personified with the Serpent\r\nof _Genesis_, and thus prove the new dogma.\r\n\r\n\r\nNoah Was A Kabir, Hence He Must Have Been A Demon.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt matters little whether it were Isis, or Ceres, the Kabiria, or again\r\nthe Kabiri, who taught men agriculture; but it is very important to\r\nprevent fanatics from monopolizing all the facts in history and legend,\r\nand from fathering their distortions of truth, history, and legend upon\r\none man. Noah is either a _myth_ along with the others, or one whose\r\nlegend was built upon the Kabirian or Titanic tradition, as taught in\r\nSamothrace; he has, therefore, no claim to be monopolized by either Jew or\r\nChristian. If, as Faber tried to demonstrate at such cost of learning and\r\nresearch, Noah is an Atlantean and a Titan, and his family are the Kabiri\r\nor pious Titans, etc.—then biblical chronology falls by its own weight,\r\nand along with it all the Patriarchs—the Antediluvian and Pre‐Atlantean\r\nTitans. As has now been discovered and proven, Cain is Mars, the God of\r\n_power and generation_, and of the first (sexual) bloodshed.(907) Tubal‐\r\nCain is a Kabir, “an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron”;\r\nor—if this will please better—he is one with Hephæstus or Vulcan. Jabal\r\nagain is taken from the Kabiri, instructors in agriculture, “such as have\r\ncattle,” and Jubal is “the father of all those who handle the harp,” he,\r\nor _they_ who fabricated the harp for Cronus and the trident for\r\nPoseidon.(908)\r\n\r\nThe history or “fables” about the mysterious Telchines—fables echoing each\r\nand all the archaic events of our Esoteric Teachings—furnish us with a key\r\nto the origin of Cain’s genealogy in the third chapter of _Genesis_; they\r\ngive the reason why the Roman Catholic Church identifies “the accursed\r\nblood” of Cain and Ham with Sorcery, and makes it responsible for the\r\nDeluge. Were not the Telchines—it is argued—the mysterious ironworkers of\r\nRhodes; they who were the first to raise statues to the Gods, furnish them\r\nwith weapons, and men with magic arts? And is it not they who were\r\ndestroyed by a Deluge at the command of Zeus, as the Cainites were by that\r\nof Jehovah?\r\n\r\nThe Telchines are simply the Kabiri and the Titans, in another form. They\r\nare the Atlanteans also. Says Decharme:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Like Lemnos and Samothrace, Rhodes, the birth‐place of the\r\n    Telchines, is an island of volcanic formation.(909)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe island of Rhodes emerged suddenly out of the seas, after having been\r\npreviously engulfed by the Ocean, say the traditions. Like the Samothrace\r\nof the Kabiri, it is connected by the memory of men with the Flood\r\nlegends. As enough has been said on this subject, however, it may be left\r\nfor the present.\r\n\r\nBut we may add a few more words about Noah, the Jewish representative of\r\nnearly every Pagan God in one or another character. The Homeric songs\r\ncontain, in poetized form, all the later fables about the Patriarchs, who\r\nare all sidereal, cosmic, and numerical symbols and signs. The attempt to\r\ndisconnect the two genealogies of Seth and Cain,(910) and the further\r\nequally futile attempt to show them as _real_, _historical_ men, has only\r\nled to more serious enquiries into the history of the past, and to\r\ndiscoveries which have damaged for ever the supposed _revelation_. For\r\ninstance, the identity of Noah and Melchizedek being established, the\r\nfurther identity of Melchizedek, or Father Sadik, with Cronus‐Saturn is\r\nalso proved.\r\n\r\nThat it is so may be easily demonstrated. It is not denied by any of the\r\nChristian writers. Bryant(911) concurs with all those who are of opinion\r\nthat Sydic, or Sadic, was the Patriarch Noah, and also Melchizedek; and\r\nthat the name by which he is called, Sadic, corresponds with the character\r\ngiven him in _Genesis_.(912)\r\n\r\n\r\n    He was צדיק, Sadic, a _just man_, and perfect in his generation.\r\n    All science and every useful art were attributed to him, and\r\n    through his sons transmitted to posterity.(913)\r\n\r\n\r\nNow it is Sanchuniathon, who informs the world that the Kabiri were the\r\nSons of Sydic or Zedek (Melchi‐zedek). True enough, as this information\r\nhas descended to us through the _Preparatio Evangelica_ of Eusebius, it\r\nmay be regarded with a certain amount of suspicion, as it is more than\r\nlikely that he dealt with Sanchuniathon’s works as he has with Manetho’s\r\nSynchronistic Tables. But let us suppose that the identification of Sydic,\r\nCronus, or Saturn, with Noah and Melchizedek, is based on one of the\r\nEusebian pious hypotheses. Let us accept it as such, along with Noah’s\r\ncharacteristic as a _just man_, and his supposed duplicate, the mysterious\r\nMelchizedek, “king of Salem, and priest of the most high God,” after “his\r\nown order”;(914) and finally, having seen what they all were spiritually,\r\nastronomically, psychically and cosmically, let us now see what they\r\nbecame rabbinically and kabalistically.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of Adam, Cain, Mars, etc., as _personifications_, we find the\r\nauthor of the _Source of Measures_ enunciating our very Esoteric Teachings\r\nin his kabalistic researches. Thus he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Now, Mars was the Lord of _birth_, and of _death_, of _generation_\r\n    and of _destruction_, of _ploughing_, of _building_, of\r\n    _sculpture_ or stone‐cutting, of _architecture_, ... in fine, of\r\n    all comprised under our English word ARTS. He was the _primal\r\n    principle_, disintegrating into the modification of _two opposites\r\n    for production_. Astronomically, too,(915) he held the birthplace\r\n    of the day and year, _the place of its increase of strength_,\r\n    Aries, and likewise the place of its death, Scorpio. He held the\r\n    house of Venus, and that of the Scorpion. He, as _birth_, was\r\n    _Good_; as _death_, was _Evil_. As _good_, he was _light_; as\r\n    _bad_, he was _night_. As _good_, he was _man_; as _bad_, he was\r\n    _woman_. He held the cardinal points, and as _Cain_, or\r\n    _Vulcan_,(916) or _Pater Sadic_, or _Melchizadek_, he was lord of\r\n    the _ecliptic_, or _balance_, or _line of adjustment_, and\r\n    therefore was _The Just One_. The ancients held to there being\r\n    seven planets, or great gods, growing out of eight, and Pater\r\n    Sadic, _The Just or Right One_, was Lord of the eighth, which was\r\n    _Mater Terra_.(917)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis makes their functions, after they had been degraded, plain enough,\r\nand establishes the identity.\r\n\r\nThe Noachian Deluge, as described in its dead‐letter and within the period\r\nof biblical chronology, having been shown to have never existed, the\r\npious, but very arbitrary, supposition of Bishop Cumberland has but to\r\nfollow that Deluge into the land of fiction. Indeed it seems rather\r\nfanciful to any impartial observer to be told that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    There were two distinct races of Cabiri, the first consisting of\r\n    Ham and Mizraim, whom he conceives to be Jupiter and Dionusus of\r\n    Mnaseas; the second, of the children of Shem, who are the Cabiri\r\n    of Sanchoniatho, while their father Sydyk is consequently the\r\n    scriptural Shem.(918)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Kabirim, the “Mighty Ones,” are identical with our primeval Dhyân\r\nChohans, with the corporeal and the incorporeal Pitris, and with all the\r\nRulers and Instructors of the primeval races, who are referred to as the\r\nGods and Kings of the Divine Dynasties.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Oldest Persian Traditions About The Polar, And The Submerged\r\nContinents.\r\n\r\n\r\nLegendary lore could not distort facts so effectually as to reduce them to\r\nunrecognizable shape. Between the traditions of Egypt and Greece on the\r\none hand, and Persia on the other—a country ever at war with the\r\nformer—there is too great a similarity of figures and numbers to admit of\r\nsuch coincidence being due to simple chance. This has been well proven by\r\nBailly. Let us pause for a moment to examine these traditions from every\r\navailable source, in order to the better compare those of the Magi with\r\nthe so‐called Grecian “fables.”\r\n\r\nThose legends have now passed into popular tales, the folklore of Persia,\r\nas many a real fiction has found its way into our universal history. The\r\nstories of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table are also fairy\r\ntales to all appearance; yet they are based on facts, and pertain to the\r\nhistory of England. Why should not the folklore of Iran be part and parcel\r\nof the history and the pre‐historic events of Atlantis? That folklore says\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nBefore the creation of Adam, two races lived on Earth, the one succeeding\r\nthe other; the Devs who reigned 7,000 years, and the Peris (the Izeds) who\r\nreigned but 2,000, and while the former were still in existence. The Devs\r\nwere giants, strong and wicked; the Peris were smaller in stature, but\r\nwiser and kinder.\r\n\r\nHere we recognize the Atlantean Giants and the Âryans, or the Râkshasas of\r\nthe _Râmâyana_ and the children of Bharata‐varsha, or India; the Ante‐ and\r\nthe Post‐diluvians of the _Bible_.\r\n\r\nGyan (or Gnan, Jnâna, True or Occult Wisdom and Knowledge), also called\r\nGian‐ben‐Gian (or Wisdom, son of Wisdom), was the king of the Peris.(919)\r\nHe had a shield as famous as that of Achilles, only instead of serving\r\nagainst an enemy in war, it served as a protection against black magic,\r\nthe _sorcery_ of the Devs. Gian‐ben‐Gian had reigned 2,000 years when\r\nIblis, the Devil, was permitted by God to defeat the Peris and scatter\r\nthem to the other end of the world. Even the magic shield, which, by being\r\nproduced on the principles of Astrology, destroyed charms, enchantments,\r\nand bad spells, could not prevail against Iblis, who was an agent of Fate,\r\nor Karma.(920) They count ten kings in their last metropolis called\r\nKhanoom, and make the tenth, Kaimurath, identical with the Hebrew Adam.\r\nThese kings answer to the ten antediluvian generations of kings as given\r\nby Berosus.\r\n\r\nDistorted as these legends are now found to be, one can hardly fail to\r\nidentify them with the Chaldæan, Egyptian, Greek, and even Hebrew\r\ntraditions, for the Jewish myth, though disdaining in its exclusiveness to\r\nspeak of Pre‐Adamite nations, nevertheless allows these to be clearly\r\ninferred, by sending out Cain—_one of the only two living men on\r\nearth_—into the land of Nod, where he gets married and builds a city.(921)\r\n\r\nNow if we compare the 9,000 years mentioned by the Persian tales with the\r\n9,000 years which Plato declared had passed since the submersion of the\r\nlast Atlantis, a very strange fact is made apparent. Bailly remarked on\r\nthis, but distorted it by his interpretation. The Secret Doctrine may\r\nrestore the figures to their true meaning. We read in the _Critias_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    First of all one must remember that 9,000 years have elapsed\r\n    _since the war of the nations_, which lived above and outside the\r\n    Pillars of Hercules, and those which peopled the lands on this\r\n    side.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the _Timæus_ Plato says the same. The Secret Doctrine declaring that\r\nmost of the later islander Atlanteans perished in the interval between\r\n850,000 and 700,000 years ago, and that the Âryans were 200,000 years old\r\nwhen the first great “Island,” or Continent, was submerged, there seems\r\nhardly any reconciliation possible between the figures. But there is, in\r\ntruth. Plato, being an Initiate, had to use the veiled language of the\r\nSanctuary, and so had the Magi of Chaldæa and Persia through whose\r\nexoteric revelations the Persian legends were preserved and passed to\r\nposterity. Thus, we find the Hebrews calling a week “seven days,” and\r\nspeaking of a “week of years” when each of its days represents 360 solar\r\nyears, and the whole “week” is 2,520 years, in fact. They had a Sabbatical\r\nweek, a Sabbatical year, etc., and their Sabbath lasted indifferently 24\r\nhours or 24,000 years, in the secret calculations of their Sods. We of the\r\npresent times call an age a “century.” They of Plato’s day, the initiated\r\nwriters, at any rate, by a millennium meant not 1,000 but 100,000 years;\r\nwhile the Hindûs, more independent than any, have never concealed their\r\nchronology. Thus, for 9,000 years, the Initiates will read 900,000 years,\r\nduring which space of time—_i.e._, from the first appearance of the Âryan\r\nRace, when the Pliocene portions of the once great Atlantis began\r\ngradually sinking(922) and other continents to appear on the surface, down\r\nto the final disappearance of Plato’s small island of Atlantis—the Âryan\r\nraces had never ceased to fight with the descendants of the first giant\r\nraces. This war lasted till nearly the close of the age which preceded the\r\nKali Yuga, and was the Mahâbhârata, or Great War, so famous in Indian\r\nhistory. Such blending of events and epochs, and the bringing down of\r\nhundreds of thousands into thousands of years, does not interfere with the\r\nnumbers of years that have elapsed, according to the statement made by the\r\nEgyptian priests to Solon, since the destruction of the last portion of\r\nAtlantis. The 9,000 years were the correct figures. The latter event had\r\nnever been kept a secret, and had only faded out of the memory of the\r\nGreeks. The Egyptians had their records complete, because of their\r\nisolation; being surrounded by sea and desert, they had been left\r\nuntrammelled by other nations, till about a few millenniums before our\r\nera.\r\n\r\nHistory catches a glimpse of Egypt and its great Mysteries for the first\r\ntime through Herodotus, if we do not take into account the _Bible_, and\r\nits queer chronology.(923) And how little Herodotus _could_ tell is\r\nconfessed by himself when, speaking of a mysterious tomb of an Initiate at\r\nSaïs, in the sacred precinct of Minerva, he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Behind the chapel ... is the tomb of One, _whose name I consider\r\n    it impious to divulge_.... In the enclosure stand large obelisks\r\n    and there is a _lake_ near, surrounded with a stone wall formed\r\n    _in a circle_.... In this lake they perform by night, that\r\n    person’s adventures, which the Egyptians call _Mysteries_: on\r\n    these matters, however, though I am accurately acquainted with the\r\n    particulars of them, _I must observe a discreet silence_.(924)\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is well to know that no secret was so well preserved\r\nand so sacred with the Ancients, as that of their cycles and computations.\r\nFrom the Egyptians down to the Jews it was held as the highest sin to\r\ndivulge anything pertaining to the correct measure of time. It was for\r\ndivulging the secrets of the Gods, that Tantalus was plunged into the\r\ninfernal regions; the keepers of the sacred Sibylline Books were\r\nthreatened with the death penalty for revealing a word from them.\r\nSigalions, or images of Harpocrates, were in every temple—especially in\r\nthose of Isis and Serapis—each pressing a finger to the lips. And the\r\nHebrews taught that to divulge the secrets of the Kabalah, after\r\ninitiation into the Rabbinical Mysteries, was like eating of the fruit of\r\nthe Tree of Knowledge; it was punishable by death.\r\n\r\nAnd yet we Europeans have accepted the exoteric chronology of the Jews!\r\nWhat wonder that it has ever since influenced and coloured all our\r\nconceptions of Science and the duration of things!\r\n\r\nThe Persian traditions, then, are full of two nations or races, now\r\nentirely extinct, as some think. But this is not so; they are only\r\ntransformed. These traditions are ever speaking of the Mountains of Kaf\r\n(Kafaristan?), which contain a gallery built by the giant Argeak, wherein\r\nstatues of the ancient men under all their forms are preserved. They call\r\nthem Sulimans (Solomons) or the wise kings of the East, and count seventy‐\r\ntwo kings of that name.(925) Three among them reigned for 1,000 years\r\neach.(926)\r\n\r\nSiamek, the beloved son of Kaimurath (Adam), their first king, was\r\nmurdered by his giant brother. His father had a perpetual fire preserved\r\nin the tomb which contained his cremated ashes; hence—the origin of fire‐\r\nworship, as some Orientalists think!\r\n\r\nThen came Huschenk, the prudent and the wise. It was his Dynasty which re‐\r\ndiscovered metals and precious stones, after they had been concealed by\r\nthe Devs or Giants in the bowels of the Earth, and also how to make brass‐\r\nwork, to cut canals, and improve agriculture. As usual, it is Huschenk,\r\nagain, who is credited with having written the work called _Eternal\r\nWisdom_, and even with having built the cities of Luz, Babylon and\r\nIspahan, though indeed they were built ages later. But as modern Delhi is\r\nbuilt on six other older cities, so these cities may be built on\r\nemplacements of other cities of an immense antiquity. As to his date, it\r\ncan only be inferred from another legend.\r\n\r\nIn the same tradition this wise prince is credited with having made war\r\nagainst the Giants on a twelve‐legged Horse, whose birth is attributed to\r\nthe _amours_ of a crocodile with a female hippopotamus. This “Dodecapod”\r\nwas found on the “dry island” or new continent; much force and cunning had\r\nto be used to secure the wonderful animal, but no sooner had Huschenk\r\nmounted him, than he defeated every enemy. No Giants could withstand his\r\ntremendous power. Finally, however, this king of kings was killed by an\r\nenormous rock which the Giants threw at him from the great mountains of\r\nDamavend.(927)\r\n\r\nTahmurath is the third king of Persia, the St. George of Iran, the knight\r\nwho always has the best of, and finally kills, the Dragon. He is the great\r\nenemy of the Devs who, in his day, dwelt in the Mountains of Kaf, and\r\noccasionally made raids on the Peris. The old French chronicles of the\r\nPersian folklore call him the Dev‐bend, the conqueror of the Giants. He,\r\ntoo, is credited with having founded Babylon, Nineveh, Diarbek, etc. Like\r\nhis grand‐sire Huschenk, Tahmurath (Taimuraz) also had his steed, only far\r\nmore rare and rapid—a bird called Simorgh‐Anke. A marvellous bird, in\r\ntruth, intelligent, a polyglot, and even very religious.(928) What says\r\nthat Persian Phœnix? It complains of its old age, for it was born cycles\r\nand cycles before the days of Adam (Kaimurath). It has witnessed the\r\nrevolutions of long centuries. It has seen the birth and the close of\r\ntwelve cycles of 7,000 years each, which multiplied Esoterically will give\r\nus again 840,000 years.(929) Simorgh is born with the last Deluge of the\r\nPre‐Adamites, says the “Romance of Simorgh and the good Khalif”!(930)\r\n\r\nWhat says the _Book of Numbers_? Esoterically, Adam Rishoon is the Lunar\r\nSpirit (Jehovah, in a sense, or the Pitris), and his three sons—Ka‐yin,\r\nHabel, and Seth—represent the three Races, as already explained. Noah‐\r\nXisuthrus represents, in his turn (in the cosmo‐geological key), the Third\r\nRace separated, and his three sons, its last three races; Ham, moreover,\r\nsymbolizing that race which uncovered the “nakedness” of the Parent Race,\r\nand of the “Mindless,” _i.e._, committed sin.\r\n\r\nTahmurath visits on his winged steed the Mountains of Koh‐Kaf or Kaph. He\r\nfinds there the Peris ill‐treated by the Giants, and slays Argen, and the\r\ngiant Demrusch. Then he liberates the good Peri, Mergiana,(931) whom\r\nDemrusch had kept as a prisoner, and takes her over to the “dry island,”\r\n_i.e._, the new continent of Europe.(932) After him came Giamschid, who\r\nbuilds Esikekar, or Persepolis. This king reigns 700 years, and, in his\r\ngreat pride, believes himself immortal, and demands divine honours. Fate\r\npunishes him; he wanders for 100 years in the world under the name of\r\nDhulkarnayn, the “two‐horned.” But this epithet has no connection with the\r\n“two‐horned” gentleman of the cloven foot. The “two‐horned” is the epithet\r\ngiven in Asia—which is uncivilized enough to know nothing of the\r\nattributes of the Devil—to those conquerors who have subdued the world\r\nfrom the East to the West.\r\n\r\nThen come the usurper Zohac, and Feridan, one of the Persian heroes, who\r\nvanquishes the former, and shuts him up in the mountains of Damavend.\r\nThese are followed by many others down to Kaikobad, who founded a new\r\nDynasty.\r\n\r\nSuch is the legendary history of Persia, and we have to analyze it. To\r\nbegin with, what are the Mountains of Kaf?\r\n\r\nWhatever they may be in their geographical status, whether they are the\r\nCaucasian or Central Asian mountains, legend places the Devs and Peris far\r\nbeyond these mountains to the North, the Peris being the remote ancestors\r\nof the Parsîs or Farsîs. Oriental tradition is ever referring to an\r\nunknown glacial, gloomy sea, and to a dark region, within which,\r\nnevertheless, are situated the “Fortunate Islands,” wherein, from the\r\nbeginning of life on earth, bubbles the “Fountain of Life.”(933) The\r\nlegend asserts, moreover, that a portion of the first “dry island”\r\n(continent), having detached itself from the main body, has remained,\r\nsince then, beyond the Mountains of Koh‐Kaf, “the stony girdle that\r\nsurrounds the world.” A journey of seven months’ duration will bring him\r\nwho is possessed of “Soliman’s Ring” to that “Fountain,” if he keep on\r\njourneying North, straight before him as the bird flies. Journeying,\r\ntherefore, from Persia _straight_ North, will bring one along the sixtieth\r\ndegree of longitude, holding to the West, to Nova Zembla; and from the\r\nCaucasus to the eternal ice beyond the Arctic Circle would land one\r\nbetween the sixtieth and forty‐fifth degrees of longitude, or between Nova\r\nZembla and Spitzbergen. This, of course, if one has the dodecapodian Horse\r\nof Huschenk or the winged Simorgh of Tahmurath, or Taimuraz, upon which to\r\ncross over the Arctic Ocean.(934)\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the wandering songsters of Persia and the Caucasus will\r\nmaintain, to this day, that far beyond the snow‐capped summits of Kap, or\r\nCaucasus, _there is a great continent now concealed from all_; that it is\r\nreached by those who can secure the services of the twelve‐legged progeny\r\nof the crocodile and the female hippopotamus, whose legs become at will\r\ntwelve _wings_,(935) or by those who have the patience to wait for the\r\ngood pleasure of Simorgh‐Anke, who promised that before she dies she will\r\nreveal the hidden continent to all, and make it once more visible and\r\nwithin easy reach, by means of a bridge, which the Ocean Devs will build\r\nbetween that portion of the “dry island” and its severed parts.(936) This\r\nrelates, of course, to the Seventh Race, Simorgh being the Manvantaric\r\nCycle.\r\n\r\nIt is very curious that Cosmas Indicopleustes, who lived in the sixth\r\ncentury A.D., should have always maintained that man was born, and dwelt\r\nat first, in a country “beyond the Ocean,” a proof of which had been given\r\nhim in India, by a learned Chaldæan. He says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The lands we live in are surrounded by the Ocean, but beyond that\r\n    Ocean there is another land which touches the walls of the sky;\r\n    and it is in this land that man was created and lived in Paradise.\r\n    During the Deluge, Noah was carried in his ark into the land his\r\n    posterity now inhabits.(937)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe twelve‐legged Horse of Huschenk was found on that continent named the\r\n“dry island.”\r\n\r\nThe “Christian Topography” of Cosmas Indicopleustes and its merits are\r\nwell known; but here the good father repeats a universal tradition, which\r\nhas now, moreover, been corroborated by facts. Every arctic traveller\r\nsuspects a continent or a “dry island” beyond the line of eternal ice.\r\nPerhaps now the meaning of the following passage from one of the\r\nCommentaries may become clearer.\r\n\r\n_In the first beginnings of [human] life, the only dry land was on the\r\nright end_(_938_)_ of the Sphere, where it [the Globe] is\r\nmotionless._(_939_)_ The whole Earth was one vast watery desert, and the\r\nwaters were tepid.... There, man was born on the seven zones of the\r\nimmortal, the indestructible of the Manvantara._(_940_)_ There was eternal\r\nspring in darkness. [But] that which is darkness to the man of to‐day, was\r\nlight to the man of his dawn. There, the Gods rested, and Fohat_(_941_)_\r\nreigns ever since.... Thus the wise Fathers say that man is born in the\r\nhead of his Mother [Earth], and that her feet at the left end generated\r\n[begot] the evil winds that blow from the mouth of the lower Dragon ...\r\nBetween the First and Second [Races] the Eternal Central [Land] was\r\ndivided by the Water of Life._(_942_)\r\n\r\n_It flows around and animates her [Mother Earth’s] body. Its one end\r\nissues from her head; it becomes foul at her feet [the Southern Pole]. It\r\ngets purified [on its return] to her heart—which beats under the foot of\r\nthe sacred Shambalah, which then [in the beginnings] was not yet born. For\r\nit is in the belt of man’s dwelling [the Earth] that lies concealed the\r\nlife and health of all that lives and breathes._(_943_)_ During the First\r\nand Second [Races] the belt was covered with the great waters. [But] the\r\ngreat __ Mother travailed under the waves and a new land was joined to the\r\nfirst one which our wise men call the head‐gear [the cap]. She travailed\r\nharder for the Third [Race] and her waist and navel appeared above the\r\nwater. It was the belt, the sacred Himavat, which stretches around the\r\nWorld._(_944_)_ She broke toward the setting Sun from her neck_(_945_)_\r\ndownward [to the South‐West], into many lands and islands, but the Eternal\r\nLand [the cap] broke not asunder. Dry lands covered the face of the silent\r\nwaters to the four sides of the World. All these perished [in their turn].\r\nThen appeared the abode of the wicked [the Atlantis]. The Eternal Land was\r\nnow hid, for the waters became solid [frozen] under the breath of her\r\nnostrils and the evil winds from the Dragon’s mouth, etc._\r\n\r\nThis shows that Northern Asia is as old as the Second Race. One may even\r\nsay that Asia is contemporary with man, since from the very beginnings of\r\nhuman life its Root‐Continent, so to speak, already existed, and that part\r\nof the world now known as Asia was only cut off from it in a later age,\r\nand divided by the glacial waters.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the teaching is understood correctly, the first Continent which\r\ncame into existence capped over the whole North Pole like one unbroken\r\ncrust, and remains so to this day, beyond that inland sea which seemed\r\nlike an unreachable _mirage_ to the few arctic travellers who perceived\r\nit.\r\n\r\nDuring the Second Race more land emerged from under the waters as a\r\ncontinuation of the “head” from the “neck.” Beginning on both hemispheres,\r\non the line above the most noryhern part of Spitzbergen,(946) on\r\nMercator’s Projection, on our side, it may have included, on the American\r\nside, the localities that are now occupied by Baffin’s Bay and the\r\nneighbouring islands and promontories. _There_ it hardly reached,\r\nsouthward, the seventieth degree of latitude; _here_ it formed the\r\nhorseshoe continent of which the Commentary speaks; of the two ends of\r\nwhich, one included Greenland with a prolongation which crossed the\r\nfiftieth degree a little South‐West, and the other Kamschatka, the two\r\nends being united by what is now the northern fringe of the coasts of\r\nEastern and Western Siberia. This broke asunder and disappeared. In the\r\nearly part of the Third Race, Lemuria was formed. When it was destroyed in\r\nits turn, Atlantis appeared.\r\n\r\n\r\nWestern Speculations, Founded On The Greek And Paurânic Traditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus it becomes natural to find that, on even such meagre data as have\r\nreached the profane historian, Rudbeck, a Swedish Scientist, about two\r\ncenturies ago, tried to prove that Sweden was the Atlantis of Plato. He\r\neven thought that he had found in the configuration of ancient Upsala, the\r\nsituation and measurements of the capital of “Atlantis” as given by the\r\nGreek sage. As Bailly proved, Rudbeck was mistaken; but so was Bailly\r\nlikewise, and still more so, for Sweden and Norway had formed part and\r\nparcel of ancient Lemuria, and also of Atlantis on the European side, just\r\nas Eastern and Western Siberia and Kamschatka had belonged to it, on the\r\nAsiatic. Only, once more, when was it? We can find it out approximately\r\nonly by studying the _Purânas_, that is to say if we will have nought to\r\ndo with the Secret Teachings.\r\n\r\nThree‐quarters of a century have already elapsed since Wilford brought\r\nforward his fanciful theories about the British islands being the “White\r\nIsland,” the Atala of the _Purânas_. This was sheer nonsense, as the Atala\r\nis one of the seven Dvîpas, or Islands, belonging to the nether Lokas, one\r\nof the seven regions of Pâtâla (the antipodes). Moreover, as Wilford(947)\r\nshows, the _Purânas_ place it “on the seventh zone or seventh\r\nclimate”—rather, on the seventh measure of heat—which thus locates it\r\nbetween the latitudes of 24° and 28° North. It is then to be sought on the\r\nsame degree as the Tropic of Cancer, whereas England is between the\r\nlatitudes of 50° and 60°. Wilford speaks of it as Atala, Atlantis, the\r\nWhite Island. Its enemy is called the “White Devil,” the Demon of Terror,\r\nfor he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In their [the Hindû and Persian] romances, we see Cai‐caus going\r\n    to the mountain of _Az‐burj_, or _As‐burj_, _at the foot of which_\r\n    the sun sets, to fight the _Div‐sefid_, or white devil, the _Târa‐\r\n    daitya_ of the _Purânas_, and whose abode was on the _seventh\r\n    stage_ of the world, answering to the seventh zone of the\r\n    Bauddhists; ... or, in other words, to the White Island.(948)\r\n\r\n\r\nNow here the Orientalists have been, and are still, facing the Sphinx’s\r\nriddle, the erroneous solution of which will ever destroy their\r\nauthority—if not their persons—in the eyes of every Hindû scholar, whether\r\nor not an Initiate. For there is not a statement in the _Purânas_—on the\r\nconflicting details of which Wilford based his speculations—which has not\r\nseveral meanings, and which does not apply to both the physical and the\r\nmetaphysical worlds. If the old Hindûs divided the face of the Globe into\r\nseven Zones, Climates, Dvîpas, geographically, and into seven Hells and\r\nseven Heavens, allegorically, the measure of seven did not apply in both\r\ncases to the same localities. Now it is the North Pole, the country of\r\n“Meru,” which is the seventh division, as it answers to the seventh\r\nPrinciple (or fourth metaphysically), of the Occult calculation. It\r\nrepresents the region of Âtmâ, of pure Soul, and Spirituality. Hence\r\nPushkara is shown as the seventh Zone, or Dvîpa, which encompasses the\r\nKshîra Ocean, or Ocean of Milk (the ever‐frozen white region) in the\r\n_Vishnu_ and other _Purânas_.(949) And Pushkara, with its two Varshas,\r\nlies directly at the foot of Meru. For it is said that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The two countries north and south of Meru are _shaped like a bow_,\r\n    ... [and that] one half of the surface of the earth is on the\r\n    south of Meru and the other half on the north of Meru—_beyond\r\n    which is half of Pushkara_.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeographically, then, Pushkara is America, Northern and Southern; and\r\nallegorically it is the prolongation of Jambu‐dvîpa,(950) in the middle of\r\nwhich stands Meru, for it is the country inhabited by beings who live ten\r\nthousand years, who are free from sickness or failing; where there is\r\nneither virtue nor vice, caste or laws, for these men are “of the same\r\nnature as the Gods.”(951) Wilford is inclined to see Meru in Mount Atlas,\r\nand locates there also the Lokâloka. Now Meru, we are told, which is the\r\nSvar‐loka, the abode of Brahmâ, of Vishnu, and the Olympus of Indian\r\nexoteric religions, is described geographically as “passing through the\r\nmiddle of the earth‐globe, and protruding on either side.”(952) On its\r\nupper station are the Gods, at the nether, or South Pole, is the abode of\r\nDemons (Hells). How then can Meru be Mount Atlas? Besides which,\r\nTâradaitya, a Demon, cannot be placed on the seventh zone if the latter be\r\nidentified with the White Island, which is Shveta‐dvîpa, for reasons given\r\nin the foot‐note above.\r\n\r\nWilford accuses the modern Brâhmans “of having jumbled them [islands and\r\ncountries] all together”; but it is _he_ who has jumbled them still more.\r\nHe believes that as the _Brahmânda_ and _Vâyu Purânas_ divide the old\r\nContinent into seven Dvîpas, said to be surrounded by a vast ocean, beyond\r\nwhich lie the regions and mountains of Atala, hence:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Most probably the Greeks derived their notion of the celebrated\r\n    Atlantis, which, as it could not be found after having once been\r\n    discovered, they conceived to have been destroyed by some shock of\r\n    nature.(953)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we find certain difficulties in believing that the Egyptian priests,\r\nPlato, and even Homer, all built their notions of Atlantis on Atala—a\r\nnether region located at the Southern Pole—we prefer holding to the\r\nstatements given in the Secret Books. We believe in the seven Continents,\r\nfour of which have already lived their day, the fifth still exists, and\r\ntwo are to appear in the future. We believe that each of these is not\r\nstrictly a continent in the modern sense of the word, but that each name,\r\nfrom Jambu down to Pushkara,(954) refers to the geographical names given\r\n(i) to the dry lands covering the face of the whole Earth during the\r\nperiod of a Root‐Race, in general; (ii) to what remained of these after a\r\ngeological Race Pralaya, as Jambu, for instance; and (iii) to those\r\nlocalities which will enter, after future cataclysms, into the formation\r\nof new universal Continents, Peninsulas, or Dvîpas(955)—each Continent\r\nbeing, in one sense, a greater or smaller region of dry land surrounded\r\nwith water. Thus, that whatever “jumble” the nomenclature of these may\r\nrepresent to the profane, there is none, in fact, to him who has the key.\r\n\r\nThus, we believe we know that, though two of the Paurânic Islands—the\r\nSixth and Seventh Continents—are yet to come, nevertheless there _were_,\r\nor there _are_, lands which will enter into the composition of the future\r\ndry lands, of new Earths whose geographical faces will be entirely\r\nchanged, as were those of the past. Therefore we find in the _Purânas_\r\nthat Shâka‐dvîpa is (or will be) a Continent, and that Shankha‐dvîpa, as\r\nshown in the _Vâyu Purâna_, is only “a minor island,” one of the nine\r\ndivisions (to which _Vâyu_ adds six more) of Bhârata‐varsha. Because\r\nShankha‐dvîpa was peopled by “Mlechchhas [unclean foreigners], who\r\nworshipped Hindû divinities,” therefore they were connected with\r\nIndia.(956) This accounts for Shankhâsura, a King of a portion of Shankha‐\r\ndvîpa, who was killed by Krishna; that King who resided in the palace\r\n“which was an ocean shell, and whose subjects lived in shells also,” says\r\nWilford.\r\n\r\n\r\n    On the banks of the Nîlâ(957) there were frequent contests between\r\n    the Devatâs [Divine Beings, Demi‐gods] and the Daityas [Giants]:\r\n    but the latter tribe having prevailed, their king and leader,\r\n    Shankhâsura, who resided in the ocean, made frequent incursions\r\n    ... in the night.(958)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not on the banks of the Nile, as Wilford supposes, but on the coasts\r\nof Western Africa, South of where now lies Morocco, that these battles\r\ntook place. There was a time when the whole of the Sahara Desert was a\r\nsea, then a continent as fertile as the Delta, and then, only after\r\nanother temporary submersion, it became a desert similar to that other\r\nwilderness, the Desert of Shamo or Gobi. This is shown in Paurânic\r\ntradition, for on the same page as above cited, it is said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The people were between two fires; for, while Shankhâsura was\r\n    ravaging one side of the continent, Cracacha [or Krauncha], king\r\n    of Crauncha‐dwîp [Krauncha‐dvîpa], used to desolate the other:\r\n    both armies ... thus _changed the most fertile of regions into a\r\n    barren desert_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat not only the last island of Atlantis, spoken of by Plato, but a large\r\nContinent, first divided, and then broken later on into seven peninsulas\r\nand islands (called Dvîpas), preceded Europe, is sure. It covered the\r\nwhole of the North and South Atlantic regions, as well as portions of the\r\nNorth and South Pacific, and had islands even in the Indian Ocean (relics\r\nof Lemuria). The claim is corroborated by Indian _Purânas_, Greek writers,\r\nand Asiatic, Persian, and Mahommedan traditions. Wilford, who sorely\r\nconfuses the Hindû and the Mussulman legends, shows this, however,\r\nclearly.(959) His facts and quotations from the _Purânas_ give direct and\r\nconclusive evidence that the Âryan Hindûs and other ancient nations were\r\nearlier navigators than the Phœnicians, who are now credited with having\r\nbeen the first seamen that appeared in the post‐diluvian times. This is\r\nwhat we read in the _Asiatick Researches_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In this distress the few natives, who survived [in the war between\r\n    Devatâs and Daityas] raised their hands and hearts to Bhagavân,\r\n    and exclaimed, “Let him that can deliver us ... be our king”;\r\n    using the word ÎT [a _magic_ term not understood by Wilford,\r\n    evidently] which reëchoed through the whole country.(960)\r\n\r\n\r\nThen comes a violent storm, the waters of the Kâlî are strangely agitated,\r\n“when there appeared from the waves ... a man, afterwards called ÎT, at\r\nthe head of a numerous army, saying ‘_abhayan_,’ or _there is no fear_”;\r\nand scattered the enemy. “The King ÎT,” explains Wilford, “is a\r\nsubordinate incarnation of Mrīra”—Mrida, a form of Rudra, probably?—who\r\n“reëstablished peace and prosperity throughout all Shankha‐dvîpa, through\r\nBarbaradêsa, Misra‐st’hân and Arva‐st’hân, or Arabia,”(961) etc.\r\n\r\nSurely, if the Hindû _Purânas_ give a description of wars on continents\r\nand islands situated beyond Western Africa in the Atlantic Ocean; if their\r\nwriters speak of Barbaras and other people such as Arabs—they who were\r\nnever known to navigate, or cross the Kâla‐pâni, the Black Waters of the\r\nOcean, in the days of Phœnician navigation—then these _Purânas_ must be\r\nolder than those Phœnicians who are placed at from 2,000 to 3,000 years\r\nB.C. At any rate, their traditions must have been older,(962) for an Adept\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n_In the above accounts, the Hindûs speak of this island as existing and in\r\ngreat power; it must, therefore, have been more than eleven thousand years\r\nago._\r\n\r\nBut another proof may be adduced of the great antiquity of these Hindû\r\nÂryans who described the last surviving island of Atlantis, or rather of\r\nthat remnant of the Eastern portion of that Continent which had perished\r\nsoon after the upheaval of the two Americas(963)—the two Varshas of\r\nPushkara. And they described what they knew, for they had once dwelt on\r\nit. This may be demonstrated, moreover, on an astronomical calculation by\r\nan Adept who criticizes Wilford. Recalling what that Orientalist had\r\nbrought forward concerning the Mount Ashburj “at the foot of which the sun\r\nsets,” where was the war between the Devatâs and the Daityas,(964) he\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n_We will consider, then, the latitude and longitude of the lost island,\r\nand of the remaining Mount Ashburj. It was on the seventh stage of the\r\nworld_, _i.e._, _in the seventh climate (which is between the latitude of\r\n24 degrees and latitude 28 degrees north).... This island, the daughter of\r\nthe Ocean, is frequently described as lying in the West; and the Sun is\r\nrepresented as setting at the foot of its mountain (Ashburj, Atlas,\r\nTeneriffe or Nila, no matter the name), and fighting the White Devil of\r\nthe __“__White Island.__”_\r\n\r\nNow, if we consider this statement from its astronomical aspect, as\r\nKrishna is the incarnated Sun (Vishnu), a solar God, and as he is said to\r\nhave killed Div‐sefid, the White Devil—a _possible_ personification of the\r\nancient inhabitants at the foot of the Atlas—he may perchance be only a\r\nrepresentation of the vertical beams of the Sun. Again, these inhabitants,\r\nthe Atlantides, as we have seen, are accused by Diodorus of daily\r\n_cursing_ the Sun, and ever fighting his influence. This is, however, only\r\nan astronomical interpretation. It will now be proved that Shankhâsura,\r\nand Shankha‐dvîpa, and all their history, is also geographically and\r\nethnologically Plato’s Atlantis in Hindû dress.\r\n\r\nIt has just been remarked that since, in the Paurânic accounts, the island\r\nis _still existing_, these accounts must be older than the 11,000 years\r\nwhich have elapsed since Shankha‐dvîpa, or the Poseidonis of Atlantis,\r\ndisappeared. But is it not barely possible that Hindûs should have known\r\nthe island still earlier? Let us turn again to astronomical\r\ndemonstrations, which make this quite plain if with the said Adept one\r\nassumes that:\r\n\r\n_At the time when the summer tropical __“__colure__”__ passed through the\r\nPleiades, when Cor Leonis would be upon the equator, and when Leo_ was\r\nvertical _to Ceylon at sunset, then would Taurus be vertical to the island\r\nof Atlantis at noon_.\r\n\r\nThis explains, perhaps, why the Sinhalese, the heirs of the Râkshasas and\r\nGiants of Lankâ, and the direct descendants of Sinha, or Leo, became\r\nconnected with Shankha‐dvîpa or Poseidonis (Plato’s Atlantis). Only, as\r\nshown by Mackey’s _Sphinxiad_, this must have occurred about 23,000 years\r\nago, _astronomically_; at which time the obliquity of the ecliptic must\r\nhave been rather more than 27 degrees, and consequently Taurus must have\r\npassed over Atlantis or Shankha‐dvîpa. And that it was so is clearly\r\ndemonstrated. Say the Commentaries:\r\n\r\n_The sacred bull Nandi was brought from Bhârata to Shankha to meet\r\nRishabha [Taurus] every Kalpa. But when those of the White Island [who\r\ndescended originally from Shveta‐dvîpa],_(_965_)_ who had mixed with the\r\nDaityas [Giants] of the land of iniquity, had become black with sin, then\r\nNandi remained for ever in the White Island [or Shveta‐dvîpa].... Those of\r\nthe Fourth World [Race] lost AUM._\r\n\r\nAsburj, or Azburj, whether the peak of Teneriffe or not, was a volcano,\r\nwhen the sinking of the “Western Atala,” or Hell, began, and those who\r\nwere saved told the tale to their children. Plato’s Atlantis perished\r\nbetween water below and fire above; the great mountain vomiting flames all\r\nthe while.\r\n\r\n_The __“__fire‐vomiting Monster__”__ survived alone out of the ruins of\r\nthe unfortunate island._\r\n\r\nDo the Greeks, who are accused of borrowing a Hindû fiction (Atala), and\r\ninventing from it another (Atlantis), stand also accused of getting their\r\ngeographical notions and the number seven from them?\r\n\r\n\r\n    “The famous Atlantis exists no longer, but we can hardly doubt\r\n    that it did once,” says Proclus, “for Marcellus, who wrote a\r\n    history of Ethiopian affairs, says that such, and so great, an\r\n    island once existed, and this is evidenced by those who composed\r\n    histories relative to the external sea. For _they relate that in\r\n    this time there were seven islands_ in the Atlantic sea sacred to\r\n    Proserpine; and besides these, three of immense magnitude, sacred\r\n    to Pluto, ... Jupiter, ... and Neptune. And, besides this, the\r\n    inhabitants of the last island [Poseidonis] _preserved the memory\r\n    of the prodigious magnitude_ of the Atlantic island as related by\r\n    their ancestors, and of its governing for many periods all the\r\n    islands in the Atlantic sea. From this _isle_ one may pass to\r\n    other large islands beyond, which are not far from the firm land,\r\n    near which is the true sea.”\r\n\r\n    These seven Dvîpas [inaccurately rendered islands] constitute,\r\n    according to Marcellus, the body of the famous Atlantis.... This\r\n    evidently shows that _Atlantis is the old continent_.... The\r\n    Atlantis was destroyed after a violent storm [?]: this is well\r\n    known to the Paurâunics, some of whom assert that in consequence\r\n    of this dreadful convulsion of nature, six of the Dvîpas\r\n    disappeared.(966)\r\n\r\n\r\nEnough proofs have now been given to satisfy the greatest sceptic.\r\nNevertheless, direct proofs based on exact Science will also be added. And\r\nyet even though volumes were written, it would be to no purpose for those\r\nwho will neither see nor hear, except through the eyes and ears of their\r\nrespective authorities.\r\n\r\nHence the teaching of the Roman Catholic scholiasts, namely, that Hermon,\r\nthe mount in the land of Mizpeth—meaning “anathema,” “destruction”—is the\r\nsame as Mount Armon. As a proof of this, Josephus is often quoted, as\r\naffirming that still in his own day enormous bones of giants were daily\r\ndiscovered on it. But it was the land of Balaam the prophet, whom the\r\n“Lord loved well.” And so mixed up are facts and personages in the said\r\nscholiasts’ brains, that, when the _Zohar_ explains the “Birds” which\r\ninspired Balaam to mean “Serpents,” to wit, the Wise Men and Adepts at\r\nwhose School he had learnt the mysteries of prophecy—the opportunity is\r\nagain taken of showing Mount Hermon inhabited by the “winged dragons of\r\nEvil, whose chief is Samael”—the Jewish Satan! As Spencer says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is to those unclean spirits chained on Mount Hermon of the\r\n    Desert, that the scape‐goat of Israel, who assumed the name of one\r\n    of them [Azaz(y)el], was sent.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe say it is not so. The _Zohar_ has the following explanation on the\r\npractice of magic which is called in Hebrew Nehhaschim, or the “Serpents’\r\nWorks.” It says (part iii. col. 302):\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is called Nehhaschim, because the magicians [practical\r\n    Kabalists] work _surrounded by the light of the Primordial\r\n    Serpent_, which they perceive in heaven as a luminous zone\r\n    composed of myriads of small stars.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis means simply the Astral Eight, so called by the Martinists, by\r\nÉliphas Lévi, and now by all the modern Occultists.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “Curse” From A Philosophical Point Of View.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing teachings of the Secret Doctrine, supplemented by universal\r\ntraditions, must now have demonstrated that the _Brâhmanas_ and _Purânas_,\r\nthe _Vendîdâd_ and other Mazdean scriptures, down to the Egyptian, Greek,\r\nand Roman, and finally to the Jewish sacred records, all have the same\r\norigin. None are meaningless and baseless stories, invented to entrap the\r\nunwary profane; all are allegories intended to convey, under a more or\r\nless fantastic veil, the great truths gathered in the same field of pre‐\r\nhistoric tradition. Space forbids us, in these volumes, from entering into\r\nfurther and more minute details with respect to the four Races which\r\npreceded our own. But before offering to the student the history of the\r\npsychic and spiritual evolution of the direct antediluvian fathers of our\r\nFifth (Âryan) Humanity, and before demonstrating its bearing upon all the\r\nother side branches grown from the same trunk, we have to elucidate a few\r\nmore facts. It has been shown, on the evidence of the whole ancient\r\nliterary world, and the intuitional speculations of more than one\r\nPhilosopher and Scientist of the later ages, that the tenets of our\r\nEsoteric Doctrine are, in almost every case, corroborated by inferential\r\nas well as by direct proof, that neither the “legendary” Giants, nor the\r\nlost Continents, nor yet the evolution of the preceding Races, are quite\r\nbaseless tales. In the Addenda which close this volume, Science will find\r\nitself more than once unable to reply; these Addenda, will, it is hoped,\r\nfinally dispose of every sceptical remark with regard to the sacred number\r\nin nature, and our figures in general.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, one task is left incomplete—the disposing of that most\r\npernicious of all the theological dogmas, the Curse under which man‐kind\r\nis alleged to have suffered ever since the supposed disobedience of Adam\r\nand Eve in the bower of Eden.\r\n\r\nCreative powers in man were the gift of Divine Wisdom, not the result of\r\nsin. This is clearly instanced in the paradoxical behaviour of Jehovah,\r\nwho first _curses_ Adam and Eve (or Humanity) for the supposed crime\r\ncommitted, and then _blesses_ his “chosen people” by saying, “Be fruitful,\r\nand multiply, and replenish the earth.”(967) The Curse was not brought on\r\nmankind by the Fourth Race, for the comparatively sinless Third Race, the\r\nstill more gigantic Antediluvians, had perished in the same way; hence the\r\nDeluge was no punishment, but simply a result of a periodical and\r\ngeological law. Nor was the Curse of Karma called down upon them for\r\nseeking _natural_ union, as all the mindless animal‐world does in its\r\nproper seasons; but, for abusing the creative power, for desecrating the\r\ndivine gift, and wasting the life‐essence for no purpose except bestial\r\npersonal gratification. When understood, the third chapter of _Genesis_\r\nwill be found to refer to the Adam and Eve of the closing Third and the\r\ncommencing Fourth Races. In the beginning, conception was as easy for\r\nwoman as it was for all animal creation. Nature had never intended that\r\nwoman should bring forth her young ones “in sorrow.” Since that period,\r\nhowever, during the evolution of the Fourth Race, there came enmity\r\nbetween its seed and the “Serpent’s” seed, the seed or product of Karma\r\nand Divine Wisdom. For the seed of woman, or lust, _bruised the head_ of\r\nthe seed of _the fruit of wisdom and knowledge_, by turning the holy\r\nmystery of procreation into animal gratification; hence the Law of Karma\r\n“bruised the _heel_” of the Atlantean Race, by gradually changing\r\nphysiologically, morally, physically, and mentally, the whole nature of\r\nthe Fourth Race of mankind,(968) until, from being the healthy king of\r\nanimal creation in the Third Race, man became in the Fifth, our Race, a\r\nhelpless, scrofulous being, and has now become the wealthiest heir on the\r\nGlobe to constitutional and hereditary diseases, the most consciously and\r\nintelligently bestial of all animals!(969)\r\n\r\nThis is the real Curse from the physiological standpoint, almost the only\r\none touched upon in Kabalistic Esotericism. Viewed from this aspect, the\r\nCurse is undeniable, for it is evident. The intellectual evolution, in its\r\nprogress hand‐in‐hand with the physical, has certainly been a curse\r\ninstead of a blessing—a gift quickened by the “Lords of Wisdom,” who have\r\npoured on the human Manas the fresh dew of their own Spirit and Essence.\r\nThe Divine Titan has then suffered in vain; and one feels inclined to\r\nregret his benefaction to mankind, and sigh for those days so graphically\r\ndepicted by Æschylus in his “Prometheus Bound,” when, at the close of the\r\nfirst Titanic Age (the Age that followed that of Ethereal Man, of the\r\npious Kandu and Pramlochâ), nascent, physical mankind, still mindless and\r\n(physiologically) senseless, is described as—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Seeing, they saw in vain;\r\n    Hearing, they heard not; but like shapes in dreams,\r\n    Through the long time all things at random mixed.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Saviours, the Agnishvâtta and other divine “Sons of the Flame of\r\nWisdom”—personified by the Greeks in Prometheus(970)—may well be left\r\nunrecognized and unthanked, in the injustice of the human heart. They may,\r\nin our ignorance of the truth, be indirectly cursed for Pandora’s gift;\r\nbut to find themselves proclaimed and declared by the mouth of the clergy,\r\nas the Evil Ones, is too heavy a Karma for “Him” who, when Zeus “ardently\r\ndesired” to quench the entire human race, “dared alone” to save that\r\n“mortal race” from perdition, or, as the suffering Titan is make to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n    From sinking blasted down to Hades’ gloom.\r\n    For this by these dire tortures I am bent,\r\n    Grievous to suffer, piteous to behold,\r\n    I who did mortals pity....\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chorus remarking very pertinently:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Vast boon was this thou gavest unto mortals!\r\n\r\n\r\nPrometheus answers:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Yea, and besides ’twas I that gave them fire.\r\n\r\n    CHORUS: Have now these short‐lived creatures flame‐eyed fire?\r\n\r\n    PROM.: Ay, and by it full many arts will learn....\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, with the arts, the “fire” received has turned into the greatest\r\ncurse; the animal element, and _consciousness_ of its possession, has\r\nchanged periodical instinct into chronic animalism and sensuality.(971) It\r\nis this which hangs over humanity like a heavy funereal pall. Thus arises\r\nthe responsibility of free‐will; the Titanic passions which represent\r\nhumanity in its darkest aspect;\r\n\r\n\r\n    The restless insatiability of the lower passions and desires,\r\n    when, with self‐asserting insolence, they bid defiance to the\r\n    restraints of law.(972)\r\n\r\n\r\nPrometheus having endowed man, according to Plato’s _Protagoras_, with\r\nthat “wisdom which ministers to physical well‐being,” but the lower aspect\r\nof Manas of the animal (Kâma) having remained unchanged, instead of “an\r\nuntainted mind, heaven’s first gift,” there was created the eternal\r\nvulture of ever unsatisfied desire, of regret and despair, coupled with\r\n“the dreamlike feebleness that fetters the blind race of mortals” (556),\r\nunto the day when Prometheus is released by his heaven‐appointed\r\ndeliverer, Herakles.\r\n\r\nNow Christians—Roman Catholics especially—have tried to prophetically\r\nconnect this drama with the coming of Christ. No greater mistake could be\r\nmade. The true Theosophist, the pursuer of Divine Wisdom and worshipper of\r\nAbsolute Perfection—the Unknown Deity which is neither Zeus nor\r\nJehovah—will demur to such an idea. Pointing to antiquity he will prove\r\nthat there never has been an _original_ sin, but only an abuse of physical\r\nintelligence—the Psychic being guided by the Animal, and both putting out\r\nthe light of the Spiritual. He will say: All you who can read between the\r\nlines, study Ancient Wisdom in the old dramas, the Indian and the Greek;\r\nread carefully the “Prometheus Bound,” enacted in the theatres of Athens\r\n2,400 years ago! The myth belongs to neither Hesiod nor Æschylus; but, as\r\nBunsen says, it “is older than the Hellenes themselves,” for it belongs,\r\nin truth, to the dawn of human consciousness. The _crucified_ Titan is the\r\npersonified symbol of the collective Logos, the “Host,” and of the “Lords\r\nof Wisdom” or the Heavenly Man, who incarnated in Humanity. Moreover, as\r\nhis name (_Pro_‐me‐_theus_, “he who sees before him” or futurity)\r\nshows(973)—in the arts he devised and taught to humanity, psychological\r\ninsight was not the least. For as he complains to the daughters of\r\nOceanus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Of prophecies the various modes I fixed, (492)\r\n    And among dreams did first discriminate\r\n    The truthful vision ... and mortals guided\r\n    To a mysterious art....\r\n    All arts to mortals from Prometheus came....\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaving for a few pages the main subject, let us pause and see what may be\r\nthe hidden meaning of this, the most ancient as it is the most suggestive\r\nof traditional allegories. As it relates directly to the early Races, this\r\nwill be no real digression.\r\n\r\nThe subject of Æschylus’ trilogy, of which two plays are lost, is known to\r\nall cultured readers. The Demi‐god robs the Gods (the Elohim) of their\r\nsecret—the mystery of the _Creative Fire_. For this sacrilegious attempt\r\nhe is struck down by Cronus(974) and delivered unto Zeus, the Father and\r\nCreator of a mankind which he would have wished to have blind\r\nintellectually, and animal‐like; a _Personal_ Deity, which will not see\r\nMan “like one of us.” Hence Prometheus, the “Fire and Light‐giver,” is\r\nchained on Mount Caucasus and condemned to suffer torture. But the triform\r\nFates (Karma), whose decrees, as the Titan says, even Zeus—\r\n\r\n\r\n    E’en he the fore‐ordained cannot escape....\r\n\r\n\r\n—ordain that those sufferings will last only to that day when a son of\r\nZeus—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ay, a son bearing stronger than his sire (787)\r\n\r\n    One of thine [Io’s] own descendants it must be (791)\r\n\r\n\r\n—is born. This “Son” will deliver Prometheus (suffering Humanity) from his\r\nown fatal gift. His name is, “He who has to come.”\r\n\r\nOn the authority, then, of these few lines, which, like any other\r\nallegorical sentence, may be twisted into almost any meaning—on the\r\nauthority of the words pronounced by Prometheus and addressed to Io, the\r\ndaughter of Inachus, persecuted by Zeus—a whole prophecy is constructed by\r\nsome Catholic writers. Says the crucified Titan:\r\n\r\n\r\n    And, portent past belief, the speaking oaks\r\n    By which full clearly, in no riddling phrase,\r\n    Wast hailed _as the illustrious spouse of Zeus_ ... (853)\r\n    ... stroking thee\r\n    With _touch alone of unalarming hand_;\r\n    Then thou _dark Epaphos_ shalt bear, whose name\r\n    Records his sacred gendering ... (870).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was construed by several fanatics—Des Mousseaux and De Mirville\r\namongst others—into a clear prophecy. Io “is the mother of God,” we are\r\ntold, and “dark Epaphos”—Christ. But, the latter has not dethroned his\r\nFather, except metaphorically, if one has to regard Jehovah as that\r\nFather; nor has the Christian Saviour hurled _his_ Father down into Hades.\r\nPrometheus says (in verse 930) that Zeus will be humbled yet:\r\n\r\n\r\n    ... such marriage he prepares\r\n    Which from his throne of power to nothingness\r\n    Shall hurl him down; so shall be all fulfilled\r\n    His father Kronos’ curse....\r\n    .... Then let him sit\r\n    Confiding in his lofty thunder‐peals,\r\n    And wielding with both hands the fiery bolt;\r\n    For _these shall not avail, but fall he shall,_\r\n    _A fall disgraceful_, not to be endured.... (980).\r\n\r\n\r\n“Dark Epaphos” was the Dionysus‐Sabasius, the son of Zeus and of Demeter\r\nin the Sabasian Mysteries, during which the “Father of the Gods,” assuming\r\nthe shape of a _Serpent_, begot on Demeter Dionysus, or the Solar Bacchus.\r\nIo is the Moon, and at the same time the Eve of a _new race_, and so is\r\nDemeter—in the present case. The Promethean myth is a prophecy indeed; but\r\nit does not relate to any of the cyclic Saviours who have appeared\r\nperiodically in various countries and among various nations, in their\r\ntransitionary conditions of evolution. It points to the last of the\r\nmysteries of cyclic transformations, in the series of which mankind,\r\nhaving passed from the ethereal to the solid physical state, from\r\nspiritual to physiological procreation, is now carried onward on the\r\nopposite arc of the cycle, toward that second phase of its primitive\r\nstate, when _woman knew no man_, and human progeny _was created, not\r\nbegotten_.\r\n\r\nThat state will return to it and to the world at large, when the latter\r\nshall discover and really appreciate the truths which underlie this vast\r\nproblem of sex. It will be like “the light that never shone on sea or\r\nland,” and has to come to men through the Theosophical Society. That light\r\nwill lead on and up to _true spiritual intuition_. Then, as expressed once\r\nin a letter to a Theosophist,\r\n\r\n\r\n    _The world will have a race of Buddhas and Christs, for the world\r\n    will have discovered that individuals have it in their own powers\r\n    to procreate Buddha‐like children—or Demons_.... When that\r\n    knowledge comes, all dogmatic religions, and with these the\r\n    Demons, will die out.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we reflect upon the serial development of the allegory, and the\r\ncharacter of the heroes, the mystery may be unriddled. Cronus is of course\r\n“Time” in its cyclic course. He swallows his children—the _personal_ Gods\r\nof exoteric dogmas included. Instead of Zeus he has swallowed his stone\r\nidol; but the symbol has grown, and has only developed in human fancy as\r\nmankind has been cycling down toward only its physical and\r\nintellectual—not spiritual—perfection. When it is as far advanced in its\r\nspiritual evolution Cronus will be no longer deceived. Instead of the\r\nstone image he will have swallowed the anthropomorphic fiction itself.\r\nBecause, the Serpent of Wisdom, represented in the Sabasian Mysteries by\r\nthe anthropomorphized Logos, the unity of spiritual and physical Powers,\r\nwill have begotten in Time (Cronus) a progeny—Dionysus‐Bacchus, or the\r\n“dark Epaphos,” the “mighty one,” the Race that will overthrow him. Where\r\nwill he be born? Prometheus traces him to his origin and birth‐place in\r\nhis prophecy to Io. Io is the Moon‐goddess of generation—for she is Isis\r\nand she is Eve, the Great Mother.(975) He traces the path of the (racial)\r\nwanderings as plainly as words can express it. She has to quit Europe and\r\ngo to Asia’s continent, reaching there the highest of the mountains of\r\nCaucasus (v. 737), the Titan telling her:\r\n\r\n\r\n    When thou hast crossed the flood, limit betwixt\r\n    Two continents, fronting the burning East.... (810)—\r\n\r\n\r\nthat she must travel Eastward, after passing the “Kimmerian Bosphorus,”\r\nand cross what is evidently the Volga and now Astrakhân on the Caspian\r\nSea. After this she will encounter “fierce northern blasts” and cross\r\nthither to the land of the “Arimaspian host” (East of Herodotus’ Scythia)\r\nto—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Pluto’s gold‐abounding flood.... (825).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is rightly conjectured by Professor Newman to have meant the Ural,\r\nthe Arimaspi of Herodotus being “the recognized inhabitants of this golden\r\nregion.”\r\n\r\nAnd here comes (between verses 825 and 835) a puzzle to all the European\r\ninterpreters. Says the Titan:\r\n\r\n\r\n    To these [Arimaspi and Grypes] approach not; a far border land\r\n    Thou next shalt reach, where dwells a swarthy race\r\n    Near the Sun’s founts, whence is the Æthiop river;\r\n    Along its banks proceed till thou attain\r\n    The mighty rapids, where from Bybline heights\r\n    Pure draughts of sacred water Neilos sends.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere Io was ordained to found a colony for herself and her sons. Now we\r\nmust see how the passage is interpreted. Io is told that she has to travel\r\nEastward till she comes to the river Ethiops, which she is to follow till\r\nit falls into the Nile—hence the perplexity. “According to the\r\ngeographical theories of the earliest Greeks,” we are informed by the\r\nauthor of the version of “Prometheus Bound”:\r\n\r\n\r\n    This condition was fulfilled by the river Indus. Arrian (vi. 1)\r\n    mentions that Alexander the Great, when preparing to sail down the\r\n    Indus [having seen crocodiles in the river Indus, and in no other\r\n    river except the Nile ...], seemed to himself to have discovered\r\n    the sources of the Nile; as though the Nile, rising from some\r\n    place in India, and flowing through much desert land, and thereby\r\n    losing its name Indus, next ... flowed through inhabited land,\r\n    being now called Nile by the Ethiopians of those parts and\r\n    afterwards by the Egyptians. Virgil in the IVth Georgic echoes the\r\n    obsolete error.(976)\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth Alexander and Virgil may have erred considerably in their\r\ngeographical notions; but the prophecy of Prometheus has not in the least\r\nso sinned—not, at any rate, in its Esoteric spirit. When a certain Race is\r\nsymbolized, and events pertaining to its history are rendered\r\nallegorically, no topographical accuracy ought to be expected in the\r\nitinerary traced for its personification. Yet it so happens, that the\r\nriver Ethiops is certainly the Indus, and it is also the Nîl or Nîlâ. It\r\nis the river born on the Kailâsa Heaven mountain, the Mansion of the\r\nGods—22,000 feet above the level of the sea. It was the Ethiops river, and\r\nwas so called by the Greeks, long before the days of Alexander, because\r\nits banks, from Attock down to Sind, were peopled by tribes generally\r\nreferred to as the Eastern Ethiopians. India and Egypt were two kindred\r\nnations, and the Eastern Ethiopians—the mighty builders—have come from\r\nIndia, as is pretty well proved, it is hoped, in _Isis Unveiled_.(977)\r\n\r\nThen why could not Alexander, and even the learned Virgil, have used the\r\nword Nile or Neilos when speaking of the Indus, since it is one of its\r\nnames? To this day the Indus is called, in the regions around Kalabagh,\r\nNîl, “blue,” and Nîlâ, the “blue river.” The water there is of such a dark\r\nblue colour that this name was given to it from time immemorial; a small\r\ntown on its banks being called by the same name, and existing to this day.\r\nEvidently Arrian, who wrote far later than the days of Alexander, and who\r\nwas ignorant of the old name of the Indus, has unconsciously slandered the\r\nGreek conqueror. Nor are our modern historians much wiser, in judging as\r\nthey do, for they often make the most sweeping declarations on mere\r\nappearances, as much as their ancient colleagues ever did in days of old,\r\nwhen no Encyclopædias were yet ready for them.\r\n\r\nThe race of Io, the “cow‐horned maid,” is then simply the first pioneer\r\nrace of the Æthiopians brought by her from the Indus to the Nile, which\r\nreceived its name in memory of the mother river of the colonists from\r\nIndia.(978) Therefore Prometheus says to Io(979) that the sacred\r\nNeilos—the God, not the river—shall guide her “to the land, _three‐\r\ncornered_,” namely, to the Delta, where her sons are foreordained to found\r\n“that far‐off colony.” (833 _et seqq._)\r\n\r\nIt is there that a new race (the Egyptians) will begin, and a “female\r\nrace” (873) which, “fifth in descent” from dark Epaphos—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Fifty in number shall return to Argos.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen one of the fifty virgins will fail through love and shall—\r\n\r\n\r\n    ... A kingly race in Argos bear....\r\n\r\n    But from this seed shall dauntless heroes spring,\r\n    Bow—famous, who shall free me from these ills.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen these heroes shall arise, the Titan does not reveal; for as he\r\nremarks:\r\n\r\n\r\n    This, to set forth at large needs lengthy speech.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut “Argos” is Arghyavarsha, the Land of Libations of the old Hierophants,\r\nwhence the Deliverer of Humanity will appear, a name which became ages\r\nlater that of its neighbour, India—the Aryâvarta of old.\r\n\r\nThat the subject formed part of the Sabasian Mysteries is made known by\r\nseveral ancient writers; among others by Cicero(980) and by Clemens\r\nAlexandrinus.(981) The latter writers are the only ones who attribute the\r\nfact of Æschylus being charged by the Athenians with sacrilege and\r\ncondemned to be stoned to death to its true cause. They say that being\r\nhimself uninitiated, Æschylus had profaned the Mysteries by exposing them\r\nin his Trilogies on a public stage.(982) But he would have incurred the\r\nsame condemnation had he been initiated; which must have been the case, as\r\notherwise he must, like Socrates, have had a Daimon to reveal to him the\r\nsecret and sacred allegorical Drama of Initiation. At all events, it is\r\nnot the “father of the Greek tragedy” who invented the prophecy of\r\nPrometheus; for he only repeated in dramatic form that which was revealed\r\nby the priests during the Mysteria of the Sabasia.(983) The latter was one\r\nof the oldest sacred festivals, whose origin is to this day unknown to\r\nhistory. Mythologists connect it through Mithras, the Sun, called Sabasius\r\non some old monuments, with Jupiter and Bacchus. It was never, however,\r\nthe property of the Greeks, but dates from days immemorial.\r\n\r\nThe translator of the drama wonders how Æschylus could become guilty of\r\nsuch\r\n\r\n\r\n    Discrepancy between the character of Zeus as portrayed in the\r\n    “Prometheus Bound” and that depicted in the remaining dramas.(984)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is just because Æschylus, like Shakespeare, was and will ever remain\r\nthe intellectual “Sphinx” of the ages. Between Zeus, the Abstract Deity of\r\nGrecian thought, and the Olympic Zeus, there was an abyss. The latter\r\nrepresented in the Mysteries no higher a principle than the lower aspect\r\nof human physical intelligence—Manas wedded to Kâma; whereas\r\nPrometheus—the divine aspect of Manas merging into and aspiring to\r\nBuddhi—was the divine Soul. Zeus, whenever shown as yielding to his lower\r\npassions, is the Human Soul and nothing more—the _jealous_ God, revengeful\r\nand cruel in its Egotism or “I‐am‐ness.” Hence, Zeus is represented as a\r\nSerpent—the intellectual tempter of man—which, nevertheless, begets in the\r\ncourse of cyclic evolution the “Man‐Saviour,” the Solar Bacchus or\r\nDionysus—_more than a man_.\r\n\r\nDionysus is one with Osiris, with Krishna, and with Buddha, the heavenly\r\nWise One, and with the coming (tenth) Avatâra, the glorified Spiritual\r\nChristos, who will deliver the suffering Chrestos—mankind, or Prometheus,\r\non its trial. This, say Brâhmanical and Buddhistic legends, echoed by the\r\nZoroastrian and now by the Christian teachings (the latter only\r\noccasionally), will happen at the end of the Kali Yuga. It is only after\r\nthe appearance of Kalki Avatâra, or Sosiosh, that man will be born from\r\nwoman without sin. Then will Brahmâ, the Hindû deity, Ahura Mazda\r\n(Ormazd), the Zoroastrian, Zeus, the Greco‐Olympian Don Juan, Jehovah, the\r\njealous, repenting, cruel, tribal God of the Israelites, and all their\r\nlikes in the universal Pantheon of human fancy—vanish and disappear in\r\nthin air. And along with these will vanish their shadows, the _dark\r\naspects_ of all these Deities, ever represented as their “twin brothers”\r\nand creatures, in exoteric legend—their own _reflection_ on Earth, in\r\nEsoteric Philosophy. The Ahrimans and Typhons, the Samaels and Satans,\r\nmust be all dethroned on that day, when every dark evil passion will be\r\nsubdued.\r\n\r\nThere is one Eternal Law in Nature, one that always tends to adjust\r\ncontraries, and to produce final harmony. It is owing to this Law of\r\nspiritual development superseding the physical and purely intellectual,\r\nthat mankind will become freed from its false Gods, and find itself\r\nfinally—Self‐redeemed.\r\n\r\nIn its final revelation, the old myth of Prometheus, of whom the proto‐\r\nand anti‐types are found in every ancient Theogony, stands in each of them\r\nat the very origin of physical evil, because at the threshold of human\r\nphysical life. Cronus is “Time,” whose first law is that the order of the\r\nsuccessive and harmonious phases, in the process of evolution during\r\ncyclic development, should be strictly preserved—under the severe penalty\r\nof abnormal growth with all its ensuing results. It was not in the\r\nprogramme of natural development, that man—higher animal though he may\r\nbe—should become at once, intellectually, spiritually, and psychically,\r\nthe Demi‐god he is on Earth, while his physical frame remains weaker, more\r\nhelpless and ephemeral, than that of almost any huge mammal. The contrast\r\nis too grotesque and violent; the tabernacle much too unworthy of its\r\nindwelling God. The gift of Prometheus thus became a Curse—though\r\n_foreknown_ and _foreseen_ by the Host personified in that personage, as\r\nhis name well shows.(985) It is in this that rests, at one and the same\r\ntime, its sin and its redemption. For the Host that incarnated in a\r\nportion of humanity, though led to it by Karma or Nemesis, preferred free‐\r\nwill to passive slavery, intellectual self‐conscious pain and even\r\ntorture, “while myriad time shall flow,” to inane, imbecile, instinctual\r\nbeatitude. Knowing such an incarnation was premature and not in the\r\nprogramme of Nature, the Heavenly Host, “Prometheus,” still sacrificed\r\nitself to benefit thereby, at least, one portion of mankind.(986) But\r\nwhile saving man from mental darkness, they inflicted upon him the\r\ntortures of the self‐consciousness of his responsibility—the result of his\r\nfree will—besides every ill to which mortal man and flesh are heir. This\r\ntorture Prometheus accepted for himself, since the Host became\r\nhenceforward blended with the tabernacle prepared for them, which was\r\nstill un‐achieved at that period of formation.\r\n\r\nSpiritual evolution being incapable of keeping pace with the physical,\r\nonce its homogeneity was broken by the admixture, the gift thus became the\r\nchief cause, if not the sole origin, of Evil.(987) Highly philosophical is\r\nthe allegory which shows Cronus cursing Zeus for dethroning him, in the\r\nprimitive Golden Age of Saturn, when all men were Demi‐gods, and for\r\ncreating a physical race of men weak and helpless in comparison; and then\r\nas delivering to his (Zeus’) revenge the culprit, who despoiled the Gods\r\nof their prerogative of creation and who thereby raised man to their\r\nlevel, intellectually and spiritually. In the case of Prometheus, Zeus\r\nrepresents the Host of the Primeval Progenitors, of the Pitaras, the\r\n“Fathers” who created man senseless and without mind; while the Divine\r\nTitan stands for the Spiritual Creators, the Devas who “fell” into\r\ngeneration. The former are spiritually lower, but physically stronger,\r\nthan the “Prometheans”; therefore, the latter are shown conquered. “The\r\nlower Host, whose work the Titan spoiled and thus defeated the plans of\r\nZeus,” was on this Earth in its own sphere and plane of action; whereas\r\nthe superior Host was an exile from Heaven, who had got entangled in the\r\nmeshes of Matter. The inferior Host were masters of all the Cosmic and\r\nlower Titanic Forces; the higher Titan possessed only the Intellectual and\r\nSpiritual Fire. This drama of the struggle of Prometheus with the Olympic\r\ntyrant and despot, sensual Zeus, one sees enacted daily within our actual\r\nmankind; the lower passions chain the higher aspirations to the rock of\r\nMatter, to generate in many a case the vulture of sorrow, pain, and\r\nrepentance. In every such case one sees once more—\r\n\r\n\r\n    A god ... in fetters, anguish fraught;\r\n    The foe of Zeus, in hatred held of all—\r\n\r\n\r\na God, bereft even of that supreme consolation of Prometheus, who suffered\r\nin self‐sacrifice—\r\n\r\n\r\n    For that to men he [I] bore too fond a mind—\r\n\r\n\r\nas the divine Titan is moved by altruism, but the mortal man by\r\nselfishness and egoïsm in every instance.\r\n\r\nThe modern Prometheus has now become Epi‐metneus, “he who sees only after\r\nthe event”; because the universal philanthropy of the former has long ago\r\ndegenerated into selfishness and self‐adoration. Man will become the\r\n_free_ Titan of old, but not before cyclic evolution has reestablished the\r\nbroken harmony between the two natures—the terrestrial and the divine;\r\nafter which he becomes impermeable to the lower Titanic Forces,\r\ninvulnerable in his Personality, and immortal in his Individuality—but\r\nthis cannot happen before every animal element is eliminated from his\r\nnature. When man understands that “_Deus non __ fecit mortem_,”(988) but\r\nthat man has created it himself, he will re‐become the Prometheus before\r\nhis Fall.\r\n\r\nFor the full symbolism of Prometheus and the origin of this mythos in\r\nGreece, the reader is referred to Part II of this Volume, Section XX,\r\n“Prometheus, the Titan,” etc. In the said Part—a kind of supplement to the\r\npresent portion—every additional information is given upon those tenets\r\nthat will be the most controverted and questioned. This work is so\r\nheterodox, when confronted with the acknowledged standards of Theology and\r\nModern Science, that no proof which tends to show that these standards\r\noften usurp an illegal authority should be neglected.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Fragments From A Commentary On The Verses Of Stanza XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe MS. from which these additional explanations are taken belongs to the\r\ngroup called _Tongshaktchi Sangye Songa_, or the “Records of the Thirty‐\r\nfive Buddhas of Confession,” as they are _exoterically_ called. These\r\npersonages, however, though called in the Northern Buddhist religion\r\nBuddhas, may just as well be called Rishis, Avatâras, etc., as they are\r\n“Buddhas who have preceded Shâkyamuni” only for the Northern followers of\r\nthe ethics preached by Gautama. These great Mahâtmâs, or Buddhas, are a\r\nuniversal and common property; they are _historical_ Sages—at any rate for\r\nall the Occultists who believe in such a Hierarchy of Sages, and who have\r\nhad its existence proved to them by the learned ones of the Fraternity.\r\nThey are chosen from among some ninety‐seven Buddhas in one group, and\r\nfifty‐three in another,(989) mostly imaginary personages, who are really\r\nthe personifications of the powers of the first‐named.(990) These\r\n“Baskets” of the oldest writings on “palm leaves” are kept very secret.\r\nEach MS. has appended to it a short synopsis of the history of that sub‐\r\nrace to which the particular Buddha‐Lha belonged. The one special MS. from\r\nwhich the fragments which follow have been extracted, and then rendered\r\ninto more comprehensible language, is said to have been copied from stone\r\ntablets which belonged to a Buddha of the earliest days of the Fifth Race,\r\nwho had witnessed the Deluge and the submersion of the chief continents of\r\nthe Atlantean Race. The day when much, if not all, of that which is given\r\nhere from the Archaic Records, will be found correct, is not far distant.\r\nThen the modern Symbologists will acquire the certitude that even Odin, or\r\nthe God Woden, the highest God in the German and Scandinavian mythology,\r\nis one of these thirty‐five Buddhas; one of the earliest, indeed, for the\r\nContinent to which he and his Race belonged is also one of the earliest—so\r\nearly, in truth, that in those days tropical nature was to be found, where\r\nnow lie eternal unthawing snows, and one could cross almost by dry land\r\nfrom Norway _viâ_ Iceland and Greenland, to the lands that at present\r\nsurround Hudson’s Bay.(991) In similar fashion, in the palmy days of the\r\nAtlantean Giants, the sons of the “Giants from the East,” a pilgrim could\r\nperform a journey from what in our days is termed the Sahara Desert, to\r\nthe lands which now rest in dreamless sleep at the bottom of the waters of\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. Events which were never written\r\noutside the human memory, but which were religiously transmitted from one\r\ngeneration to another, and from race to race, may have been preserved by\r\nconstant transmission “within the book volume of the brain,” and through\r\ncountless æons, with more truth and accuracy than inside any written\r\ndocument or record. “That which is part of our souls is eternal,” says\r\nThackeray; and what can be nearer to our Souls than that which happens at\r\nthe dawn of our lives? Those lives are countless, but the Soul or Spirit\r\nthat animates us throughout these myriads of existences is the same; and\r\nthough “the book volume” of the _physical brain_ may forget events within\r\nthe scope of one terrestrial life, the bulk of collective recollections\r\ncan never desert the Divine Soul within us. Its whispers may be too soft,\r\nthe sound of its words too far off the plane perceived by our physical\r\nsenses; yet the shadow of events _that were_, just as much as the shadow\r\nof the events _that are to come_, is within its perceptive powers, and is\r\never present before its mind’s eye.\r\n\r\nIt is this Soul‐voice, perhaps, which tells those who believe in tradition\r\nmore than in written history, that what is said below is all true, and\r\nrelates to pre‐historic facts.\r\n\r\nThis is what is written in one passage:\r\n\r\n_The Kings of Light have departed in wrath. The sins of men have become so\r\nblack that Earth quivers in her great agony.... The Azure Seats remain\r\nempty. Who of the Brown, who of the Red, or yet among the Black [Races],\r\ncan sit in the Seats of the Blessed, the Seats of Knowledge and Mercy? Who\r\ncan assume the Flower of Power, the Plant of the Golden Stem and the Azure\r\nBlossom?_\r\n\r\nThe “Kings of Light” is the name given in all old records to the\r\nSovereigns of the Divine Dynasties. The “Azure Seats” are translated\r\n“Celestial Thrones” in certain documents. The “Flower of Power” is now the\r\nLotus; what it may have been at that period, who can tell?\r\n\r\nThe writer proceeds, like the later Jeremiah, to bewail the fate of his\r\npeople. They had become bereft of their “Azure” (Celestial) Kings, and\r\n“they of the deva‐hue,” the moon‐like complexion, and “they of the\r\nrefulgent (golden) face” have gone “to the Land of Bliss, the Land of Fire\r\nand Metal”—or, agreeably with the rules of symbolism, to the lands lying\r\nNorth and East, from whence “the Great Waters have been swept away, sucked\r\nin by the Earth and dissipated in the Air.” The wise races had perceived\r\n“the black Storm‐dragons, called down by the Dragons of Wisdom”—and “had\r\nfled, led on by the shining Protectors of the most Excellent Land”—the\r\ngreat ancient Adepts, presumably; those the Hindûs refer to as their Manus\r\nand Rishis. One of them was Vaivasvata Manu.\r\n\r\nThey “of the yellow hue” are the forefathers of those whom Ethnology now\r\nclasses as the Turanians, the Mongols, Chinese and other ancient nations;\r\nand the land they fled to was no other than Central Asia. There, entirely\r\nnew races were born; there, they lived and died until the separation of\r\nthe nations. But this “separation” did not take place either in the\r\nlocalities assigned for it by Modern Science, nor in the way the Âryans\r\nare shown to have divided and separated by Prof. Max Müller and other\r\nÂryanists. Nearly two‐thirds of one million years have elapsed since that\r\nperiod. The yellow‐faced giants of the Post‐Atlantean day had ample time,\r\nthrough this forced confinement to one part of the world, with the same\r\nracial blood and without any fresh infusion or admixture in it, during a\r\nperiod of nearly 700,000 years, to branch off into the most heterogeneous\r\nand diversified types. The same is shown in Africa; nowhere does a more\r\nextraordinary variability of types exist, from black to almost white, from\r\ngigantic men to dwarfish races; and this only because of their forced\r\nisolation. The Africans have not left their continent for several hundred\r\nthousands of years. If to‐morrow the continent of Europe were to disappear\r\nand other lands to reëmerge instead, and if the African tribes were to\r\nseparate and scatter on the face of the Earth, it is they who, in about a\r\nhundred thousand years hence, would form the bulk of the civilized\r\nnations. And it is the descendants of those of our highly cultured\r\nnations, who might have survived on some one island, without any means of\r\ncrossing the new seas, that would fall back into a state of relative\r\nsavagery. Thus the reason given for dividing humanity into _superior_ and\r\n_inferior_ races falls to the ground and becomes a fallacy.\r\n\r\nSuch are the facts given in the Archaic Records. Collating and comparing\r\nthem with some modern theories of evolution, _minus_ Natural\r\nSelection,(992) these statements appear quite reasonable and logical.\r\nThus, while the Âryans are the descendants of the _yellow_ Adam, the\r\ngigantic and highly civilized Atlanto‐Âryan race, the Semites—and the Jews\r\nalong with them—are those of the _red_ Adam, and thus both De Quatrefages\r\nand the writers of the Mosaic _Genesis_ are right. For, could chapter v of\r\nthe First Book of Moses be compared with the genealogies found in our\r\nArchaic Bible, the period from Adam unto Noah would be found noticed\r\ntherein, though of course under different names, the respective years of\r\nthe Patriarchs being turned into periods, and the whole being symbolical\r\nand allegorical. In the MS. under consideration many and frequent are the\r\nreferences to the great knowledge and civilization of the Atlantean\r\nnations, showing the polity of several of them and the nature of their\r\narts and sciences. If the Third Root‐Race, the Lemuro‐Atlanteans, are\r\nalready spoken of as having been drowned “with their high civilizations\r\nand Gods,”(993) how much more may the same be said of the Atlanteans!\r\n\r\nIt is from the Fourth Race that the early Âryans got their knowledge of\r\n“the bundle of wonderful things,” the Sabhâ and Mâyâsabhâ, mentioned in\r\nthe _Mahâbhârata_, the gift of Mâyâsura to the Pândavas. It is from them\r\nthat they learnt æronautics, Vimâna Vidyâ, the “knowledge of flying in\r\nair‐vehicles,” and, therefore, their great arts of Meteorography and\r\nMeteorology. It is from them, again, that the Âryans inherited their most\r\nvaluable Science of the hidden virtues of precious and other stones, of\r\nChemistry, or rather Alchemy, of Mineralogy, Geology, Physics and\r\nAstronomy.\r\n\r\nSeveral times the writer has put to herself the question: Is the story of\r\n_Exodus_—in its details at least—as narrated in the _Old Testament_,\r\noriginal? Or is it, like the story of Moses himself and many others,\r\nsimply another version of the legends told of the Atlanteans? For who,\r\nupon hearing the story told of the latter, will fail to perceive the great\r\nsimilarity of the fundamental features? Remember the anger of “God” at the\r\nobduracy of Pharaoh, his command to the “chosen” ones to spoil the\r\nEgyptians, before departing, of their “jewels of silver and jewels of\r\ngold,”(994) and finally the Egyptians and their Pharaoh drowned in the Red\r\nSea. Then read the following fragment of the earlier story from the\r\nCommentary:\r\n\r\n_And the __“__Great King of the Dazzling Face__”__ the chief of all the\r\nYellow‐faced, was sad, seeing the sins of the Black‐faced._\r\n\r\n_He sent his air‐vehicles [Vimânas] to all his brother‐chiefs [chiefs of\r\nother nations and tribes] with pious men within, saying:_\r\n\r\n“_Prepare. Arise, ye men of the Good Law, and cross the land while [yet]\r\ndry._\r\n\r\n“_The Lords of the storm are approaching. Their chariots are nearing the\r\nland. One night and two days only shall the Lords of the Dark Face [the\r\nSorcerers] live on this patient land. She is doomed, and they have to\r\ndescend with her. The nether Lords of the Fires [the Gnomes and Fire\r\nElementals] are preparing their magic Agnyastra [fire‐weapons worked by\r\nMagic]. But the Lords of the Dark Eye [__‘__Evil Eye__’__] are stronger\r\nthan they [the Elementals] and they are the slaves of the mighty ones.\r\nThey are versed in Astra [Vidyâ, the highest magical knowledge]._(_995_)_\r\nCome and use yours_ [i.e., _your magic powers, in order to counteract\r\nthose of the Sorcerers]. Let every Lord of the Dazzling Face [an Adept of\r\nthe White Magic] cause the Vimâna of every Lord of the Dark Face to come\r\ninto his hands [or possession], lest any [of the Sorcerers] should by its\r\nmeans escape from the waters, avoid the Rod of the Four [Karmic Deities],\r\nand save his wicked [followers, or people]._\r\n\r\n“_May every Yellow Face send sleep from himself to [mesmerize?] every\r\nBlack Face. May even they [the Sorcerers] avoid pain and suffering. May __\r\nevery man true to the Solar Gods bind [paralyze] every man under the Lunar\r\nGods, lest he should suffer or escape his destiny._\r\n\r\n“_And may every Yellow Face offer of his life‐water [blood] to the\r\nspeaking animal of a Black Face, lest he awaken his master._(996)\r\n\r\n“_The hour has struck, the black night is ready._\r\n\r\n“_Let their destiny be accomplished. We are the servants of the Great\r\nFour._(_997_)_ May the Kings of Light return._”\r\n\r\n_The great King fell upon his Dazzling Face and wept...._\r\n\r\n_When the Kings assembled, the waters had already moved...._\r\n\r\n_[But] the nations had now crossed the dry lands. They were beyond the\r\nwater‐mark. Their Kings reached them in their Vimânas, and led them on to\r\nthe lands of Fire and Metal [East and North]._\r\n\r\nStill, in another passage, it is said:\r\n\r\n_Stars [meteors] showered on the lands of the Black Faces; but they\r\nslept._\r\n\r\n_The speaking beasts [the magic watchers] kept quiet._\r\n\r\n_The nether Lords waited for orders, but they came not, for their masters\r\nslept._\r\n\r\n_The waters arose, and covered the valleys from one end of the Earth to\r\nthe other. High lands remained, the bottom of the Earth [the lands of the\r\nantipodes] remained dry. There dwelt those who escaped; the men of the\r\nYellow Faces and of the straight eye [the frank and sincere people]._\r\n\r\n_When the Lords of the Dark Faces awoke and bethought themselves of their\r\nVimânas in order to escape from the rising waters, they found them gone._\r\n\r\nThen a passage shows some of the more powerful Magicians of the “Dark\r\nFaces,” who awoke earlier than the others, pursuing those who had “spoilt\r\nthem” and who were in the rear‐guard, for—“the nations that were led away\r\nwere as thick as the stars of the milky way,” says a more modern\r\nCommentary, written in Sanskrit only.\r\n\r\n_Like as a dragon‐snake uncoils slowly its body, so the Sons of Men, led\r\non by the Sons of Wisdom, opened their folds, and spreading out, expanded\r\nlike a running stream of sweet waters ... many of the faint‐hearted among\r\nthem perished on their way. But most were saved._\r\n\r\nYet the pursuers, “whose heads and chests soared high above the water,”\r\nchased them “for three lunar terms” until finally reached by the rising\r\nwaves, they perished to the last man, the soil sinking under their feet\r\nand the Earth engulfing those who had desecrated her.\r\n\r\nThis sounds a good deal like the original material upon which the similar\r\nstory in _Exodus_ was built many hundred thousands of years later. The\r\nbiography of Moses, the story of his birth, childhood and rescue from the\r\nNile by Pharaoh’s daughter, is now shown to have been adapted from the\r\nChaldæan narrative about Sargon. And if so, the Assyrian tiles in the\r\nBritish Museum being a good proof of it, why not that of the Jews robbing\r\nthe Egyptians of their jewels, the death of Pharaoh and his army, and so\r\non? The gigantic Magicians of Ruta and Daitya, the “Lords of the Dark\r\nFace,” may, in the later narrative, have become the Egyptian Magi, and the\r\nyellow‐faced nations of the Fifth Race, the virtuous sons of Jacob, the\r\n“chosen people”! One more statement has to be made. There have been\r\nseveral Divine Dynasties—a series for every Root‐Race beginning with the\r\nThird, each series according and adapted to its Humanity. The last seven\r\nDynasties referred to in the Egyptian and Chaldæan records belonged to the\r\nFifth Race, which, though generally called Âryan, was not entirely so, as\r\nit was ever largely mixed up with races to which Ethnology gives other\r\nnames. It would be impossible, in view of the limited space at our\r\ndisposal, to go any further into the description of the Atlanteans, in\r\nwhom the whole East believes as much as we believe in the ancient\r\nEgyptians, but whose existence the majority of the Western Scientists\r\ndeny, as they have denied, before this, many a truth, from the existence\r\nof Homer down to that of the carrier pigeon. The civilization of the\r\nAtlanteans was greater than even that of the Egyptians. It is their\r\ndegenerate descendants, the nation of Plato’s Atlantis, who built the\r\nfirst Pyramids in the country, and that certainty before the advent of the\r\n“Eastern Æthiopians,” as Herodotus calls the Egyptians. This may be well\r\ninferred from the statement made by Ammianus Marcellinus, who says of the\r\nPyramids that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    There are also subterranean passages and winding retreats, which,\r\n    it is said, men skilful in the ancient mysteries, by means of\r\n    which they divined the coming of a flood, constructed in different\r\n    places lest the memory of all their sacred ceremonies should be\r\n    lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese men who “divined the coming of floods” were not Egyptians, who never\r\nhad any, except the periodical rising of the Nile. Who were they? The last\r\nremnants of the Atlanteans, we maintain; those races which are dimly\r\nsuspected by Science, and thinking of which Mr. Charles Gould, the well‐\r\nknown Geologist, says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Can we suppose that we have at all exhausted the great museum of\r\n    nature? Have we, in fact, penetrated yet beyond its antechambers?\r\n    Does the written history of man, comprising a few thousand years,\r\n    embrace the whole course of his intelligent existence? or have we\r\n    in the long mythical eras, extending over hundreds of thousands of\r\n    years, and recorded in the chronologies of Chaldæa and of China,\r\n    shadowy mementoes of pre‐historic man, handed down by tradition,\r\n    and perhaps transported by a few survivors to existing lands from\r\n    others, which, like the fabled (?) Atlantis of Plato, may have\r\n    been submerged, or the scene of some great catastrophe which\r\n    destroyed them with all their civilization.(998)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this one can turn with more confidence to the words of a Master who\r\nwrote, several years before these words were penned by Mr. Gould:\r\n\r\n_The Fourth Race had its periods of the highest civilization. Greek and\r\nRoman and even Egyptian civilizations are nothing compared to the\r\ncivilizations that began with the Third Race [—after its separation]._\r\n\r\nBut if this civilization and the mastery of arts and sciences are denied\r\nto the Third and Fourth Races, no one will deny that between the great\r\ncivilizations of antiquity, such as those of Egypt and India, there\r\nstretched the dark ages of crass ignorance and barbarism ever since the\r\nbeginning of the Christian era up to our modern civilization, during which\r\nperiod all recollection of these traditions was lost. As said in _Isis\r\nUnveiled_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Why should we forget that, ages before the prows of the\r\n    adventurous Genoese clove the Western waters, the Phœnician\r\n    vessels had circumnavigated the Globe, and spread civilization in\r\n    regions now silent and deserted? What Archæologist will dare\r\n    assert that the same hand which planned the Pyramids of Egypt,\r\n    Karnak, and the thousand ruins now crumbling to oblivion on the\r\n    sandy banks of the Nile, did _not_ erect the monumental Nagkon‐Wat\r\n    of Cambodia; or trace the hieroglyphics on the obelisks and doors\r\n    of the deserted Indian village, newly discovered in British\r\n    Columbia by Lord Dufferin; or those on the ruins of Palenque and\r\n    Uxmal, of Central America? Do not the relics we treasure in our\r\n    museums—last mementoes of the long “lost arts”—speak loudly in\r\n    favour of ancient civilization? And do they not prove, over and\r\n    over again, that nations and continents that have passed away have\r\n    buried along with them arts and sciences, which neither the first\r\n    crucible ever heated in a mediæval cloister, nor the last cracked\r\n    by a modern chemist, have revived, nor will—at least, in the\r\n    present century.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the same question may be put now that was put then; it may be once\r\nmore asked:\r\n\r\n\r\n    How does it happen that the most advanced standpoint that has been\r\n    reached in our times, only enables us to see in the dim distance\r\n    up the Alpine path of knowledge the monumental proofs that earlier\r\n    explorers have left to mark the plateaux they had reached and\r\n    occupied?\r\n\r\n    If modern masters are so much in advance of the old ones, why do\r\n    they not restore to us the lost arts of our postdiluvian\r\n    forefathers? Why do they not give us the unfading colours of\r\n    Luxor—the Tyrian purple, the bright vermilion, and dazzling blue\r\n    which decorate the walls of this place, and are as bright as on\r\n    the first day of their application; the indestructible cement of\r\n    the pyramids and of ancient aqueducts; the Damascus blade, which\r\n    can be turned like a corkscrew in its scabbard without breaking;\r\n    the gorgeous, unparalleled tints of the stained glass that is\r\n    found amid the dust of old ruins and beams in the windows of\r\n    ancient cathedrals; and the secret of the true malleable glass?\r\n    And if Chemistry is so little able to rival even the early\r\n    mediæval ages in some arts, why boast of achievements which,\r\n    according to strong probability, were perfectly known thousands of\r\n    years ago. The more Archæology and Philology advance, the more\r\n    humiliating to our pride are the discoveries which are daily made,\r\n    the more glorious testimony do they bear in behalf of those who,\r\n    perhaps on account of the distance of their remote antiquity, have\r\n    been until now considered ignorant flounderers in the deepest mire\r\n    of superstition.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong other Arts and Sciences, the Ancients—ay, as an heirloom from the\r\nAtlanteans—had those of Astronomy and Symbolism, which included the\r\nknowledge of the Zodiac.\r\n\r\nAs already explained, the whole of Antiquity believed, with good reason,\r\nthat humanity and its races are all intimately connected with the Planets,\r\nand these with the Zodiacal Signs. The whole world’s history is recorded\r\nin the latter. In the ancient temples of Egypt there is an example in the\r\nDendera Zodiac; but except in an Arabic work, the property of a Sûfî, the\r\nwriter has never met with a correct copy of these marvellous records of\r\nthe past—and also of the _future_—history of our Globe. Yet the original\r\nrecords exist, most undeniably.\r\n\r\nAs Europeans are unacquainted with the real Zodiacs of India, and those\r\nthey do happen to know of they fail to understand, as witness Bentley, the\r\nreader is advised, in order to verify the statement, to turn to the work\r\nof Denon(999) in which the two famous Egyptian Zodiacs can be found and\r\nexamined. Having seen them personally, the writer has no longer need to\r\ntrust to what other students—who have examined and studied both very\r\ncarefully—have to say of them. The assertion of the Egyptian Priests to\r\nHerodotus, that the terrestrial Pole and the Pole of the Ecliptic had\r\nformerly coincided, has been corroborated by Mackey, who states that the\r\nPoles are represented on the Zodiacs in both positions.\r\n\r\n\r\n    And in that which shows the Poles [polar axes] at right angles,\r\n    there are marks which show, that it was not the last time they\r\n    were in that position; _but the first_ [—after the Zodiacs had\r\n    been traced]. Capricorn, is, therein, represented at the North\r\n    Pole; and Cancer is divided, near its middle, at the South Pole;\r\n    which is a confirmation that, originally they had their winter\r\n    when the Sun was in Cancer. But the chief characteristics of its\r\n    being a monument commemorating the _first time_ that the Pole had\r\n    been in that position, are the Lion and the Virgin.(1000)\r\n\r\n\r\nBroadly calculated, it is believed by Egyptologists that the Great Pyramid\r\nwas built 3,350 B.C.;(1001) and that Menes and his Dynasty existed 750\r\nyears before the appearance of the Fourth Dynasty—during which the\r\nPyramids are _supposed_ to have been built. Thus 4,100 years B.C. is the\r\nage assigned to Menes. Now Sir J. Gardner Wilkinson’s declaration that all\r\nthe facts lead to the conclusion that the Egyptians had already—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Made very great progress in the arts of civilization _before the\r\n    age of Menes, and perhaps before they immigrated into the valley\r\n    of the Nile_—(1002)\r\n\r\n\r\nis very suggestive, as destroying this hypothesis of the comparatively\r\nmodern civilizing of Egypt. It points to a great civilization in _pre‐\r\nhistoric_ times, and a still greater antiquity. The Schesoo‐Hor, the\r\n“servants of Horus,” were the people who had settled in Egypt; and, as M.\r\nMaspéro affirms, it is to this “pre‐historic race” that—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Belongs the honour of having constituted Egypt, such as we know\r\n    it, from the commencement of the historic period.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd Staniland Wake adds:\r\n\r\n\r\n    They founded the principal cities of Egypt, and established the\r\n    most important sanctuaries.(1003)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was _before_ the Great Pyramid epoch, and when Egypt had hardly\r\narisen from the waters. Yet:\r\n\r\n\r\n    They possessed the hieroglyphic form of writing special to the\r\n    Egyptians, and must have been already considerably advanced in\r\n    civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs says Lenormant:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It was the country of the great pre‐historic sanctuaries, seats of\r\n    the sacerdotal dominion, which played the most important part in\r\n    the origin of civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the date assigned to this people? We hear of 4,000, at the utmost\r\nof 5,000, years B.C. (Maspéro). Now it is claimed that it is by means of\r\nthe Cycle of 25,868 years (the Sidereal Year) that the approximate year of\r\nthe erection of the Great Pyramid can be ascertained.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Assuming that the long narrow downward passage leading from the\r\n    entrance was directed towards the pole‐star of the pyramid\r\n    builders, astronomers have shown that in the year 2,170 B.C. the\r\n    passage pointed to Alpha Draconis, the then pole‐star.... Mr.\r\n    Richard A. Proctor, the astronomer, after stating that the pole‐\r\n    star was in the required position about 3,350 B.C., as well as in\r\n    2,170 B.C., says: “either of these would correspond with the\r\n    position of the descending passage in the Great Pyramid; but\r\n    Egyptologists tell us there can absolutely be no doubt that the\r\n    later epoch is far too late.”(1004)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut we are also told that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    This relative position of Alpha Draconis and Alcyone being an\r\n    extraordinary one ... it could not occur again for a whole\r\n    Sidereal Year.(1005)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis demonstrates that, since the Dendera Zodiac shows the passage of\r\nthree Sidereal Years, the Great Pyramid must have been built 78,000 years\r\nago, or in any case that this possibility deserves to be accepted at least\r\nas readily as the later date of 3,350 B.C.\r\n\r\nNow on the Zodiac of a certain temple in far Northern India, the same\r\ncharacteristics of the signs as on the Dendera Zodiac are found. Those who\r\nknow the Hindû symbols and constellations well, will be able to find out\r\nfrom the description of the Egyptian, whether the indications of time are\r\ncorrect or not. On the Dendera Zodiac, as preserved by the modern Egyptian\r\nCoptic and Greek Adepts, and explained a little differently by Mackey, the\r\nDion stands upon the Hydra and his tail is almost straight, pointing\r\ndownwards at an angle of forty or fifty degrees, this position agreeing\r\nwith the _original_ conformation of these constellations. But adds Mackey:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In many places we see the Lion [Sinha], with his tail turned up\r\n    over his back, and ending with a Serpent’s head; thereby, shewing\r\n    that the Lion had been _inverted_: which, indeed, must have been\r\n    the case with the whole Zodiac, and every other Constellation,\r\n    when the Pole had been inverted.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the _circular_ Zodiac, which is also given by Denon, he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    There ... the Lion is standing _on_ the Serpent, and his tail\r\n    forming a curve downward, from which we find that, _though six or\r\n    seven hundred thousand years_ must have passed between the two\r\n    positions, yet they had made but little or no difference in the\r\n    Constellations of Leo and the Hydra; while Virgo is represented\r\n    very differently in the two—in the circular Zodiac, the Virgin is\r\n    _nursing her child_: but it seems that they had not had that idea\r\n    when the Pole was first within the plane of the Ecliptic; for in\r\n    _this_ Zodiac, as given by Denon, we see three Virgins between the\r\n    Lion and the Scales, the last of which holds, in her hand, an ear\r\n    of wheat. It is much to be lamented that, there is in this Zodiac\r\n    a breach of the figures in the latter part of Leo and the\r\n    beginning of Virgo, which has taken away one _Decan_ out of each\r\n    sign.(1006)\r\n\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the meaning is plain, as the three Zodiacs belong to three\r\ndifferent epochs; namely, to the last three family races of the fourth\r\nsub‐race of the Fifth Root‐Race, each of which must have lived\r\napproximately from 25,000 to 30,000 years. The first of these, the “Âryan‐\r\nAsiatics,” witnessed the doom of the last of the populations of the Giant\r\nAtlanteans(1007) (the Ruta and Daitya Island‐Continents) who perished some\r\n850,000 years ago, toward the close of the Miocene Age.(1008) The fourth\r\nsub‐race witnessed the destruction of the last remnant of the\r\nAtlanteans—the Âryo‐Atlanteans in the last island of Atlantis, namely,\r\nsome 11,000 years ago. In order to understand this, the reader is asked to\r\nglance at the diagram of the Genealogical Tree of the Fifth Root‐\r\nRace—generally, though hardly correctly, called the Âryan Race—and the\r\nexplanations appended to it.\r\n\r\nLet the reader remember well that which is said of the divisions of Root‐\r\nRaces and the evolution of Humanity in this work, and stated clearly and\r\nconcisely in Mr. Sinnett’s _Esoteric Buddhism_.\r\n\r\n1. There are seven Rounds in every Manvantara; this Round is the Fourth,\r\nand we are in the Fifth Root‐Race, at present.\r\n\r\n2. Each Root‐Race has seven sub‐races.\r\n\r\n3. Each sub‐race has, in its turn, seven ramifications, which may be\r\ncalled “branch” or “family” races.\r\n\r\n4. The little tribes, shoots, and offshoots of the last‐named are\r\ncountless, and depend on Karmic action.\r\n\r\nExamine the Genealogical Tree hereto appended, and you will understand.\r\nThe illustration is purely diagrammatic, and is only intended to assist\r\nthe reader in obtaining a slight grasp of the subject, amidst the\r\nconfusion which exists between the terms which have been used at different\r\ntimes for the divisions of Humanity. It is also here attempted to express\r\nin figures—but only within approximate limits, for the sake of\r\ncomparison—the duration of time through which it is possible to definitely\r\ndistinguish one division from another. It would only lead to hopeless\r\nconfusion if any attempt were made to give accurate dates to a few; for\r\nthe Races, sub‐races, etc., down to their smallest ramifications, overlap\r\nand are entangled with each other until it is nearly impossible to\r\nseparate them.\r\n\r\n        [Illustration: Genealogical Tree of the Fifth Root‐Race.]\r\n\r\nThe Human Race has been compared to a tree, and this serves admirably as\r\nan illustration.\r\n\r\nThe main stem of a tree may be compared to the Root‐Race (A).\r\n\r\nIts larger limbs to the various sub‐races; seven in number (B1, B2, etc.).\r\n\r\nOn each of these limbs are seven “branches,” or “family” races (C).\r\n\r\nAfter this the cactus‐plant is a better illustration, for its fleshy\r\n“leaves” are covered with sharp spines, each of which may be compared to a\r\nnation or tribe of human beings.\r\n\r\nNow our Fifth Root‐Race has already been in existence—as a Race _sui\r\ngeneris_ and quite free from its parent stem—about 1,000,000 years;\r\ntherefore it must be inferred that each of the four preceding sub‐races\r\nhas lived approximately 210,000 years; thus each family race has an\r\naverage existence of about 30,000 years, and thus the European “family\r\nrace” has still a good many thousand years to run, although the nations or\r\nthe innumerable spines upon it, vary with each succeeding “season” of\r\nthree or four thousand years. It is somewhat curious to mark the\r\ncomparative approximation of duration between the lives of a “family race”\r\nand a Sidereal Year.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of the foregoing, and the absolutely correct divisions of\r\ntime, formed part and parcel of the Mysteries, where these Sciences were\r\ntaught to the Disciples, and where they were transmitted by one Hierophant\r\nto another. Everyone is aware that the European Astronomers\r\nassign—arbitrarily enough—the date of the invention of the Egyptian Zodiac\r\nto the years 2,000 or 2,400 B.C. (Proctor); and insist that the date of\r\nthis invention coincides with that of the erection of the Great Pyramid.\r\nThis, to an Occultist and Eastern Astronomer, must appear quite absurd.\r\nThe Cycle of the Kali Yuga is said to have begun between the 17th and 18th\r\nof February in the year 3,102 B.C. Now the Hindûs claim that in the year\r\n20,400 before Kali Yugam, the origin of their Zodiac coincided with the\r\nSpring Equinox—there being at the time a conjunction of the Sun and\r\nMoon—and Bailly proved by a lengthy and careful computation of that date,\r\nthat, even if fictitious, the epoch from which they had started to\r\nestablish the beginning of their Kali Yuga was _very real_. That “epoch is\r\nthe year 3,102 before our era,” he writes.(1009) The lunar eclipse\r\narriving just a fortnight after the beginning of the Black Age—it took\r\nplace in a point situated between the Wheat Ear of Virgo and the star Θ of\r\nthe same constellation. One of their most esoteric Cycles is based upon\r\ncertain conjunctions and respective positions of Virgo and the Pleiades\r\n(Krittika). Hence, as the Egyptians brought their Zodiac from Southern\r\nIndia and Lankâ,(1010) the esoteric meaning was evidently identical. The\r\n“three Virgins,” or Virgo in three different positions, meant, with both,\r\nthe record of the first three “Divine or Astronomical Dynasties,” who\r\ntaught the Third Root‐Race; and after having abandoned the Atlanteans to\r\ntheir doom, returned, or redescended rather, during the third sub‐race of\r\nthe Fifth, in order to reveal to saved humanity the mysteries of their\r\nbirth‐place—the Sidereal Heavens. The same symbolical record of the human\r\nRaces and the three Dynasties (Gods, Manes—Semi‐divine Astrals of the\r\nThird and Fourth—and the Heroes of the Fifth Race) which preceded the\r\npurely human kings, was found in the distribution of the tiers and\r\npassages of the Egyptian Labyrinth. As the three inversions of the Poles\r\nof course changed the face of the Zodiac, a new one had to be constructed\r\neach time. In Mackey’s _Sphinxiad_ the speculations of the bold author\r\nmust have horrified the orthodox portion of the population of Norwich, for\r\nhe says, fantastically enough:\r\n\r\n\r\n    But, after all, the greatest length of time recorded by those\r\n    monuments [the Labyrinth, the Pyramids and the Zodiacs] _does not\r\n    exceed five millions of years_:(1011) which falls short of the\r\n    records given us both by the [esoteric] Chinese and Hindoos: which\r\n    latter nation has registered a knowledge of time for seven or\r\n    eight millions of years:(1012) which I have seen upon a talisman\r\n    of porcelain.(1013)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian priests had the Zodiacs of the Atlantean Asura Maya, as the\r\nmodern Hindûs still have. As stated in _Esoteric Buddhism_, the Egyptians,\r\nas well as the Greeks and “Romans” some thousand years ago, were “remnants\r\nof the Atlanto‐Âryans”—the former, of the older, or the Ruta Atlanteans;\r\nthe last‐named, the descendants of the last race of that island, whose\r\nsudden disappearance was narrated to Solon by the Egyptian Initiates. The\r\n_human_ Dynasty of the older Egyptians, beginning with Menes, had all the\r\n_knowledge_ of the Atlanteans, though there was no longer Atlantean blood\r\nin their veins. Nevertheless, they had preserved all their Archaic\r\nRecords. All this has been shown long ago.(1014) And it is just because\r\nthe Egyptian Zodiac is between 75,000 and 80,000 years old that the Zodiac\r\nof the Greeks is far later. Volney has correctly pointed out that it is\r\nonly 16,984 years old, or up to the present date 17,082.(1015)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpace forbids us to say anything more, and this part of _The Secret\r\nDoctrine_ has to be closed. The forty‐nine Stanzas and the few fragments\r\nfrom the Commentaries which have been given are all that can be published\r\nin these Volumes. These, with some still older Records—to which none but\r\nthe highest Initiates have access—and a whole library of comments,\r\nglossaries, and explanations, form the synopsis of Man’s Genesis.\r\n\r\nIt is from these Commentaries that we have hitherto quoted and tried to\r\nexplain the hidden meaning of some of the allegories, thus showing the\r\ntrue views of Esoteric Antiquity upon Geology, Anthropology, and even\r\nEthnology. In the Part which follows we will endeavour to establish a\r\nstill closer metaphysical connection between the earliest Races and their\r\nCreators, the _Divine_ Men from other Worlds; accompanying the statements\r\nproffered with the most important demonstrations of the same in Esoteric\r\nAstronomy and Symbolism.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the “periods” that separate, in space and time, the Fourth\r\nfrom the Fifth Race—in the historical(1016) or even the legendary\r\nbeginnings of the latter—is too tremendous for us to offer, even to a\r\nTheosophist, any more detailed accounts of them. During the course of the\r\nPost‐diluvian Ages, which were marked at certain periodical epochs by the\r\nmost terrible cataclysms, too many races and nations were born, and\r\ndisappeared almost without leaving a trace, for anyone to offer any\r\ndescription of the slightest value concerning them. Whether the Masters of\r\nWisdom have a full and consecutive history of our Race from its incipient\r\nstage down to the present times; whether they possess the uninterrupted\r\nrecord of man since he developed into a complete physical being, and\r\nbecame thereby the king of the animals and master on this Earth—is not for\r\nthe writer to say. Most probably they have, and such is our own personal\r\nconviction. But if so, this knowledge is only for the highest Initiates,\r\nwho do not take their students into their confidence. The writer can,\r\ntherefore, give but what she has herself been taught, and no more, and\r\neven this will appear to the profane reader rather as a weird, fantastic\r\ndream, than as a possible reality.\r\n\r\nThis is only natural and as it should be, since for years such was the\r\nimpression made upon the humble writer of these pages herself. Born and\r\nbred in European, matter‐of‐fact and presumably civilized, countries, she\r\nassimilated the foregoing with the utmost difficulty. But there are proofs\r\nof a certain character which become irrefutable and are undeniable in the\r\nlong run, to every earnest and unprejudiced mind. For a series of years\r\nsuch were offered to her, and now she has the full certitude that our\r\npresent Globe and its human Races must have been born, grown and developed\r\nin this, and in no other way.\r\n\r\nBut this is the personal view of the writer; and her orthodoxy cannot be\r\nexpected to have any more weight than any other “doxy,” in the eyes of\r\nthose to whom every fresh theory is heterodox until otherwise proved.\r\nTherefore are we Occultists fully prepared for such questions as these:\r\nHow do we know that the writer has not invented the whole scheme? And\r\nsupposing _she_ has not, how can one tell that the whole of the foregoing,\r\nas given in the Stanzas, is not the product of the imagination of the\r\nancients? How could they have preserved the records of such an immense,\r\nsuch an incredible antiquity?\r\n\r\nThe answer that the history of this world since its formation and to its\r\nend is “written in the stars,” _i.e._, is recorded in the Zodiac and\r\nUniversal Symbolism, whose keys are in the keeping of the Initiates, will\r\nhardly satisfy the doubters. The antiquity of the Zodiac in Egypt is much\r\ndoubted, and it is denied point‐blank with regard to India. “Your\r\nconclusions are often excellent, but your premises are always doubtful,”\r\nthe writer was once told by a profane friend. To this, the answer came\r\nthat it was at least one point gained on scientific syllogisms, for, with\r\nthe exception of a few problems from the domain of purely Physical\r\nScience, both the premises and conclusions of men of Science are as\r\nhypothetical as they are almost invariably erroneous. And if they do not\r\nso appear to the profane, the reason is simply this: the said profane are\r\nvery little aware, taking as they do their scientific data on faith, that\r\nboth premises and conclusions are generally the product of the same\r\nbrains, which, however learned, are not infallible—a truism demonstrated\r\ndaily by the shifting and re‐shifting of scientific theories and\r\nspeculations.\r\n\r\nHowever it may be, the records of the temples, zodiacal and traditional,\r\nas well as the ideographic records of the East, as read by the Adepts of\r\nthe Sacred Science or Vidyâ, are not a whit more doubtful than the so‐\r\ncalled ancient history of the European nations, now edited, corrected, and\r\namplified by half a century of archæological discoveries, and the very\r\nproblematical readings of the Assyrian tiles, cuneiform fragments, and\r\nEgyptian hieroglyphics. Our data also are based upon the same\r\n“readings”—in addition to an almost inexhaustible number of secret works\r\nof which Europe knows nothing—_plus_ the perfect knowledge by the\r\nInitiates of the symbolism of every word so recorded. Some of these\r\nrecords belong to an immense antiquity. Every Archæologist and\r\nPalæontologist is acquainted with the ideographic productions of certain\r\nsemi‐savage tribes, who from time immemorial have aimed at rendering their\r\nthoughts symbolically. This is the earliest mode of recording events and\r\nideas. And how old this knowledge is in the human race may be inferred\r\nfrom some signs, evidently ideographic, found on hatchets of the\r\nPalæolithic period. The Red Indian tribes of America, only a few years\r\nago, comparatively speaking, petitioned the President of the United States\r\nto grant them possession of four small lakes, the petition being written\r\non the tiny surface of a piece of fabric, which was covered with barely a\r\ndozen representations of animals and birds. The American savages have a\r\nnumber of such different kinds of writing, but not one of our Scientists\r\nis yet familiar with, or even knows of, the early hieroglyphic cypher,\r\nstill preserved in some Fraternities, and named in Occultism the Senzar.\r\nMoreover, all those who have decided to regard such modes of\r\nwriting—_e.g._, the ideographs of the Red Indians, and even the Chinese\r\ncharacters—as “attempts of the early races of mankind to express their\r\nuntutored thoughts,” will decidedly object to our statement, that writing\r\nwas invented by the Atlanteans, and not at all by the Phœnicians. Indeed,\r\nsuch a claim as that writing was known to mankind many hundreds of\r\nmillenniums ago, in the face of the Philologists who have decreed that\r\nwriting was unknown in the days of Pânini, in India, as also to the Greeks\r\nin the time of Homer, will be met by general disapprobation, if not with\r\nsilent scorn. All denial and ridicule notwithstanding, the Occultists will\r\nmaintain the claim, and simply for this reason: from Bacon down to our\r\nmodern Royal Society, we have too long a period full of the most ludicrous\r\nmistakes made by Science, to warrant our believing in modern scientific\r\nassumptions rather than in the statements of our Teachers. Writing, our\r\nScientists say, was unknown to Pânini; and this Sage nevertheless composed\r\na grammar which contains 3,996 rules, and is the most perfect of all the\r\ngrammars that were ever made! Pânini is made out to have lived barely a\r\nfew centuries B.C., by the most liberal; and the rocks in Iran and Central\r\nAsia—whence the Philologists and Historians show us the ancestors of the\r\nsame Pânini, the Brâhmans, coming into India—are _covered with writing_,\r\ntwo and three thousand years old, at least, and twelve thousand, according\r\nto some fearless Palæontologists.\r\n\r\nWriting was an _ars incognita_ in the days of Hesiod and Homer, agreeably\r\nto Grote, and was unknown to the Greeks so late as 770 B.C.; and the\r\nPhœnicians who had _invented_ it, and knew writing as far back as 1,500\r\nB.C. at the earliest,(1017) were living among the Greeks, and elbowing\r\nthem, all the time! All these scientific and contradictory conclusions\r\ndisappeared, however, into thin air, when Schliemann discovered (_a_) the\r\nsite of ancient Troy, whose actual existence had been so long regarded as\r\na fable, and (_b_) excavated from that site earthenware vessels with\r\ninscriptions _in characters unknown_ to Palæontologists and the all‐\r\ndenying Sanskritists. Who will now deny Troy, or these archaic\r\ninscriptions? As Professor Virchow witnesses:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I was myself an eye‐witness of two such discoveries, and helped to\r\n    gather the articles together. The slanderers have long since been\r\n    silenced, who were not ashamed to charge the discoverer with an\r\n    imposture.(1018)\r\n\r\n\r\nNor were truthful women spared any more than truthful men. Du Chaillu,\r\nGordon Cumming, Madame Merian,(1019) Bruce, and a host of others were\r\ncharged with lying.\r\n\r\nSays the author of _Mythical Monsters_, who gives this information in the\r\nIntroduction:(1020)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Madame Merian was accused of deliberate falsehood in reference to\r\n    her description of a bird‐eating spider nearly two hundred years\r\n    ago. But now‐a‐days ... reliable observers have confirmed it in\r\n    regard to South America, India, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n    Audubon was similarly accused by botanists of having invented the\r\n    yellow water‐lily, which he figured in his _Birds of the South_\r\n    under the name of Nymphæa lutea, and after having lain under the\r\n    imputation for years, was confirmed at last by the discovery of\r\n    the long‐lost flower in Florida ... in ... 1876.(1021)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd, as Audubon was called a liar for this, and for his Haliætus\r\nWashingtonii,(1022) so Victor Hugo was ridiculed for his marvellous word‐\r\npainting of the devil‐fish, and his description of a man becoming its\r\nhelpless victim.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The thing was derided as a monstrous impossibility; yet within a\r\n    few years were discovered, on the shores of Newfoundland, cuttle‐\r\n    fishes with arms extending to thirty feet in length, and capable\r\n    of dragging a good‐sized boat beneath the surface; and their\r\n    action has been reproduced _for centuries past_ ... by Japanese\r\n    artists.(1023)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd if Troy was denied, and regarded as a myth; the existence of\r\nHerculaneum and Pompeii declared a fiction; the travels of Marco Polo\r\nlaughed at and called as absurd a fable as one of Baron Münchausen’s\r\ntales, why should the writer of _Isis Unveiled_ and of _The Secret\r\nDoctrine_ be any better treated? Mr. Charles Gould, the author of the\r\nabove‐cited volume quotes, in his excellent work, a few lines from\r\n_Macmillan_ (1860), which are as true as life, and too much to the point\r\nnot to be reproduced:\r\n\r\n\r\n    When a naturalist, either by visiting such spots of earth as are\r\n    still out of the way, or by his good fortune, finds a very queer\r\n    plant or animal, he is forthwith accused of inventing his game....\r\n    As soon as the creature is found to sin against preconception, the\r\n    great (mis?) guiding spirit, _à priori_ by name, who furnishes\r\n    philosophers with their omniscience _pro re natâ_, whispers that\r\n    no such thing _can_ be, and forthwith there is a charge of hoax.\r\n    The heavens themselves have been charged with hoaxes. When\r\n    Leverrier and Adams predicted a planet by calculation, it was\r\n    gravely asserted in some quarters that the planet which had been\r\n    calculated was not _the_ planet but another which had\r\n    clandestinely and improperly got into the neighbourhood of the\r\n    true body. _The disposition to suspect hoax is stronger than the\r\n    disposition to hoax._ Who was it that first announced that the\r\n    classical writings of Greece and Rome were one huge hoax\r\n    perpetrated by the monks in what the announcer would be as little\r\n    or less inclined than Dr. Maitland to call the dark ages?(1024)\r\n\r\n\r\nThus let it be. No disbeliever who takes _The Secret Doctrine_ for a\r\n“hoax” is forced, or even asked, to credit our statements, which have\r\nalready been proclaimed to be such by certain very clever American\r\njournalists even before the work went to press.(1025)\r\n\r\nNor, after all, is it necessary that any one should believe in the Occult\r\nSciences and the Old Teachings, before he knows anything of, or even\r\nbelieves in his own Soul. No great truth has ever been accepted _à __\r\npriori_, and generally a century or two has passed before it has begun to\r\nglimmer in the human consciousness as a possible verity, except in such\r\ncases as the positive discovery of the thing claimed as a fact. The truths\r\nof to‐day are the falsehoods and errors of yesterday, and _vice versà_. It\r\nis only in the twentieth century that portions, if not the whole, of the\r\npresent work will be vindicated.\r\n\r\nIt is not destructive of our statements, therefore, even if Sir John Evans\r\ndoes affirm that writing was unknown in the Stone Age. For it may have\r\nbeen unknown during that period in the Fifth Âryan Race, and yet have been\r\nperfectly known to the Atlanteans of the Fourth, in the palmy days of\r\ntheir highest civilization. The cycles of the rise and fall of nations and\r\nraces are there to account for it.\r\n\r\nIf told that there have been cases before now of forged pseudographs being\r\npalmed off on the credulous, and that our work may be classed with\r\nJacolliot’s _Bible in India_—although, by the way, there are more truths\r\nmixed up with its errors than are found in the works of orthodox and\r\nrecognized Orientalists—the charge and comparison will dismay us very\r\nlittle. We bide our time. Even the famous _Ezour Veda_ of the last\r\ncentury, considered by Voltaire “the most precious gift from the East to\r\nthe West,” and by Max Müller “about the silliest book that can be read,”\r\nis not altogether without facts and truths in it. The cases when the _à\r\npriori_ negations of specialists have become justified by subsequent\r\ncorroborations, form but an insignificant percentage of those that have\r\nbeen fully vindicated by subsequent discoveries and confirmed, to the\r\ngreat dismay of the learned objectors. _Ezour Veda_ was a very small bone\r\nof contention compared with the triumph of Sir William Jones, Anquetil du\r\nPerron, and others in the matter of Sanskrit and its literature. Such\r\nfacts are recorded by Professor Max Müller himself, who, speaking of the\r\ndiscomfiture of Dugald Stewart and Co. in connection with this, states\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n\r\n    If the facts about Sanskrit were true, Dugald Stewart was too wise\r\n    not to see that the conclusions drawn from them were inevitable.\r\n    He therefore denied the reality of such a language as Sanskrit\r\n    altogether, and wrote his famous essay to prove that Sanskrit had\r\n    been put together after the model of Greek and Latin, by those\r\n    arch‐forgers and liars, the Brâhmans, and that the whole of\r\n    Sanskrit literature was an imposition.(1026)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe writer is quite willing and feels proud to keep company with these\r\nBrâhmans, and other _historical_ “liars,” in the opinion of our modern\r\nDugald Stewarts. She has lived too long, and her experience has been too\r\nvaried and personal, for her not to know at least something of human\r\nnature. “When you doubt, abstain,” says the wise Zoroaster, whose prudent\r\naphorism is found corroborated in every case by daily life and experience.\r\nYet, like St. John the Baptist, this Sage of the past ages is found\r\npreaching in the desert, in company with a more modern Philosopher, namely\r\nBacon, who offers the same priceless bit of practical wisdom, when saying:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In contemplation [in any question of knowledge, we add], if a man\r\n    begin with certainties, he shall end in doubts; but _if he will be\r\n    content to begin with doubts, he shall end in certainties_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith this piece of advice from the father of English Philosophy to the\r\nrepresentatives of British Scepticism we ought to close the debate, but\r\nour Theosophical readers are entitled to a final piece of Occult\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nEnough has been said to show that evolution in general, events, mankind,\r\nand everything else in Nature proceed in cycles. We have spoken of seven\r\nRaces, five of which have nearly completed their earthly career, and have\r\nclaimed that every Root‐Race, with its sub‐races and innumerable family\r\ndivisions and tribes, was entirely distinct from its preceding and\r\nsucceeding Race. This will be objected to, on the authority of uniform\r\nexperience, in the question of Anthropology and Ethnology. Man—save in\r\ncolour and type, and perhaps a difference in facial peculiarities and\r\ncranial capacity—has been ever the same under every climate and in every\r\npart of the world, say the Naturalists; ay, even in stature—this, while\r\nmaintaining that man descends from the same unknown ancestor as the ape; a\r\nclaim that is logically impossible without an infinite variation of\r\nstature and form from his first evolution into a biped. The very logical\r\npersons who maintain both propositions are welcome to their paradoxical\r\nviews. Once more we address only those who, doubting the general\r\nderivation of myths from “the contemplation of the visible workings of\r\nexternal nature,” think it\r\n\r\n\r\n    Less hard to believe that these wonderful stories of gods and\r\n    demi‐gods, of giants and dwarfs, of dragons and monsters of all\r\n    descriptions, are transformations, than to believe them to be\r\n    inventions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is only such “transformations” in physical nature, as much as in the\r\nmemory and conceptions of our present mankind, that the Secret Doctrine\r\nteaches. It confronts the purely speculative hypotheses of Modern Science,\r\nbased upon the experience and exact observations of barely a few\r\ncenturies, with the unbroken tradition and records of its Sanctuaries; and\r\nbrushing away that tissue of cobweb‐like theories, spun in the darkness\r\nthat covers a period of hardly a few millenniums, which Europeans call\r\ntheir “history,” the Old Science says to us: Listen, now, to my version of\r\nthe memoirs of Humanity.\r\n\r\nThe Human Races are born one from the other, grow, develop, become old,\r\nand die. Their sub‐races and nations follow the same rule. If your all‐\r\ndenying Modern Science and so‐called Philosophy do not contest that the\r\nhuman family is composed of a variety of well‐defined types and races, it\r\nis only because the fact is undeniable; no one would say that there was no\r\nexternal difference between an Englishman, an African negro, and a\r\nJapanese or Chinaman. On the other hand, it is formally denied by most\r\nNaturalists that _mixed_ human races, _i.e._, the seeds for entirely new\r\nraces, are any longer formed in our days, although indeed the latter is\r\nmaintained on good grounds by De Quatrefages and some others.\r\n\r\nNevertheless our general proposition will not be accepted. It will be said\r\nthat whatever forms man has passed through in the long pre‐historic past\r\nthere are no more changes for him—save certain variations, as at\r\npresent—in the future. Hence that our Sixth and Seventh Root‐Races are\r\nfictions.\r\n\r\nTo this it is again answered: How do you know? Your experience is limited\r\nto a few thousand years, to less than a day in the whole age of Humanity\r\nand to the present types of the actual continents and isles of our Fifth\r\nRace. How can you tell what will or will not be? Meanwhile, such is the\r\nprophecy of the Secret Books and their not uncertain statements.\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of the Atlantean Race many million years have passed,\r\nyet we find the last of the Atlanteans still mixed up with the Âryan\r\nelement, 11,000 years ago. This shows the enormous overlapping of one Race\r\nover the Race which succeeds it, though in characters and external type\r\nthe elder loses its characteristics, and assumes the new features of the\r\nyounger Race. This is proved in all the formations of mixed human races.\r\nNow, Occult Philosophy teaches that even now, under our very eyes, the new\r\nRace and races are preparing to be formed, and that it is in America that\r\nthe transformation will take place, and has already silently commenced.\r\n\r\nPure Anglo‐Saxons hardly three hundred years ago, the Americans of the\r\nUnited States have already become a nation apart, and, owing to a strong\r\nadmixture of various nationalities and inter‐marriage, almost a race _sui\r\ngeneris_, not only mentally, but also physically. To quote from De\r\nQuatrefages:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Every mixed race, when uniform and settled, has been able to play\r\n    the part of a primary race in fresh crossings. Mankind, in its\r\n    present state, has thus been formed, certainly for the greatest\r\n    part, by the successive crossing of a number of races _at present\r\n    undetermined_.(1027)\r\n\r\n\r\nThus the Americans have become in only three centuries a “primary race,”\r\ntemporarily, before becoming a race apart, and strongly separated from all\r\nother now existing races. They are, in short, the germs of the _sixth_\r\nsub‐race, and in some few hundred years more, will become most decidedly\r\nthe pioneers of that race which must succeed to the present European or\r\nfifth sub‐race, in all its new characteristics. After this, in about\r\n25,000 years, they will launch into preparations for the seventh sub‐race;\r\nuntil, in consequence of cataclysms—the first series of those which must\r\none day destroy Europe, and still later the whole Âryan Race (and thus\r\naffect both Americas), as also most of the lands directly connected with\r\nthe confines of our continent and isles—the Sixth Root‐Race will have\r\nappeared on the stage of our Round. When shall this be? Who knows save the\r\ngreat Masters of Wisdom, perchance, and they are as silent upon the\r\nsubject as the snow‐capped peaks that tower above them. All we know is,\r\nthat it will silently come into existence; so silently, indeed, that for\r\nlong millenniums will its pioneers—the peculiar children who will grow\r\ninto peculiar men and women—be regarded as anomalous _lusûs naturæ_,\r\nabnormal oddities physically and mentally. Then, as they increase, and\r\ntheir numbers become with every age greater, one day they will awake to\r\nfind themselves in a majority. Then the present men will begin to be\r\nregarded as exceptional mongrels, until they die out in their turn in\r\ncivilized lands, surviving only in small groups on islands—the mountain\r\npeaks of to‐day—where they will vegetate, degenerate, and finally die out,\r\nperhaps millions of years hence, as the Aztecs have, as the Nyam‐Nyam and\r\nthe dwarfish Moola Koorumba of the Nilghiri Hills are dying. All these are\r\nthe remnants of once mighty races, the recollection of whose existence has\r\nentirely died out of the remembrance of modern generations, just as we\r\nshall vanish from the memory of the Sixth Race Humanity. The Fifth will\r\noverlap the Sixth Race for many hundreds of millenniums, changing with it\r\nmore slowly than its new successor, still changing in stature, general\r\nphysique, and mentality, just as the Fourth overlapped our Âryan Race, and\r\nthe Third had overlapped the Atlanteans.\r\n\r\nThis process of preparation for the Sixth great Race must last throughout\r\nthe whole sixth and seventh sub‐races.(1028) But the _last_ remnants of\r\nthe Fifth Continent will not disappear until some time after the birth of\r\nthe _new_ Race; when another and _new_ dwelling, the Sixth Continent, will\r\nhave appeared above the _new_ waters on the face of the Globe, so as to\r\nreceive the new stranger. To it also will emigrate and there will settle\r\nall those who will be fortunate enough to escape the general disaster.\r\nWhen this shall be—as just said—it is not for the writer to know. Only, as\r\nNature no more proceeds by sudden jumps and starts, than man changes\r\nsuddenly from a child into a mature man, the final cataclysm will be\r\npreceded by many smaller submersions and destructions both by wave and\r\nvolcanic fires. The exultant pulse will beat high in the heart of the race\r\nnow in the American zone, but there will be no more Americans when the\r\nSixth Race commences; no more, in fact, than Europeans; for they will have\r\nnow become a _new Race, and many new nations_. Yet the Fifth will not die,\r\nbut will survive for a while; overlapping the new Race for many hundred\r\nthousands of years to come, it will, as we have just said, become\r\ntransformed with it more slowly than its new successor—still getting\r\nentirely altered in mentality, general physique, and stature. Mankind will\r\nnot grow again into giant bodies as in the case of the Lemurians and the\r\nAtlanteans; because while the evolution of the Fourth Race led the latter\r\ndown to the very bottom of materiality in its physical development, the\r\npresent Race is on its ascending arc; and the Sixth will be rapidly\r\ngrowing out of its bonds of matter, and even of flesh.\r\n\r\nThus it is the mankind of the New World, the senior by far of our Old\r\none—a fact men had also forgotten—of Pâtâla (the Antipodes, or the Nether\r\nWorld, as America is called in India), whose mission and Karma it is, to\r\nsow the seeds for a forthcoming, grander, and far more glorious Race than\r\nany of those we know of at present. The Cycles of Matter will be succeeded\r\nby Cycles of Spirituality and a fully developed mind. On the law of\r\nparallel history and races, the majority of the future mankind will be\r\ncomposed of glorious Adepts. Humanity is the child of Cyclic Destiny, and\r\nnot one of its Units can escape its unconscious mission, or get rid of the\r\nburden of its coöperative work with Nature. Thus will Mankind, race after\r\nrace, perform its appointed Cyclic Pilgrimage. Climates will, and have\r\nalready begun to, change, each Tropical Year after the other dropping one\r\nsub‐race, but only to beget another higher race on the ascending cycle;\r\nwhile a series of other less favoured groups—the failures of Nature—will,\r\nlike some individual men, vanish from the human family without even\r\nleaving a trace behind.\r\n\r\nSuch is the course of Nature under the sway of Karmic Law; of Ever‐present\r\nand Ever‐becoming Nature. For, in the words of a Sage, known only to a few\r\nOccultists:\r\n\r\n_The Present is the child of the Past; the Future, the begotten of the\r\nPresent. And yet, O present moment! knowest thou not that thou hast no\r\nparent, nor canst thou have a child; that thou art ever begetting but\r\nthyself? Before thou hast even begun to say __“__I am the progeny of the\r\ndeparted moment, the child of the past,__”__ thou hast become that past\r\nitself. Before thou utterest the last syllable, behold! thou art no more\r\nthe Present but verily that Future. Thus, are the Past, the Present, and\r\nthe Future the Ever‐living Trinity in One—the Mahámâyâ of the Absolute\r\n__“__IS.__”_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II. THE ARCHAIC SYMBOLISM OF THE WORLD‐RELIGIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The narratives of the Doctrine are its cloak. The simple look only\r\n    at the garment—that is, upon the narrative of the Doctrine; more\r\n    they know not. The instructed, however, see not merely the cloak,\r\n    but what the cloak covers.—_Zohar_ (iii. 152; FRANCK, 119).\r\n\r\n    The Mysteries of the Faith (are) not to be divulged to all.... It\r\n    is requisite to hide in a mystery the wisdom spoken.—_Stromateis_\r\n    (12; CLEMENS ALEXANDRINUS).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection I. Esoteric Tenets Corroborated in Every Scripture.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn view of the strangeness of the teachings, and of many a doctrine which\r\nfrom the modern scientific standpoint must seem absurd, some necessary and\r\nadditional explanations have to be made. The theories contained in the\r\nStanzas of Volume II are even more difficult to assimilate than those\r\nwhich are embodied in Volume I, on Cosmogony. Theology, therefore, has to\r\nbe questioned here, in Part II, as Science will be in Part III, for since\r\nour doctrines differ so widely from the current ideas of both Materialism\r\nand Theology, the Occultists must be ever prepared to repel the attacks of\r\neither or of both.\r\n\r\nThe reader can never be too often reminded that, as the abundant\r\nquotations from various old Scriptures prove, these teachings are as old\r\nas the world; and that the present work is simply an attempt to render, in\r\nmodern language and in a phraseology with which the scientific and\r\neducated student is familiar, archaic Genesis and History as taught in\r\ncertain Asiatic centres of Esoteric Learning. These must be accepted or\r\nrejected on their own merits, fully or partially; but not before they have\r\nbeen carefully compared with the corresponding theological dogmas and the\r\nmodern scientific theories and speculations.\r\n\r\nOne feels serious doubt whether, with all its intellectual acuteness, our\r\nage is destined to discover in each Western nation even one solitary\r\n_uninitiated_ Scholar or Philosopher capable of fully comprehending the\r\nspirit of Archaic Philosophy. Nor can either be expected to do so, before\r\nthe real meaning of the Alpha and the Omega of Eastern Esotericism, the\r\nterms Sat and Asat—so freely used in the _Rig Veda_ and elsewhere—is\r\nthoroughly assimilated. Without this key to Âryan Wisdom, the Cosmogony of\r\nthe Rishis and the Arhats is in danger of remaining a dead letter to the\r\naverage Orientalist. Asat is not merely the negation of Sat, nor is it the\r\n“not yet existing”; for Sat is in itself neither the “existent,” nor\r\n“being.” Sat is the immutable, the ever‐present, changeless, and eternal\r\nRoot, from and through which all proceeds. But it is far more than the\r\npotential force in the seed, which propels onward the process of\r\ndevelopment, or what is now called evolution. It is the ever becoming,\r\nthough the never manifesting.(1029) Sat is born from Asat, and Asat is\r\nbegotten by Sat—perpetual motion in a circle, truly; yet a circle that can\r\nbe squared only at the Supreme Initiation, at the threshold of\r\nParinirvâna.\r\n\r\nBarth started a reflection on the _Rig Veda_ which was meant for a stern\r\ncriticism, an unusual, therefore, as was thought, an original, view of\r\nthis archaic volume. It so happened, however, that, in his criticism, this\r\nscholar revealed a truth, without being himself aware of its full\r\nimportance. He premises by saying that “neither in the language nor in the\r\nthought of the _Rig Veda_” has he “been able to discover that quality _of\r\nprimitive natural simplicity_, which so many are fain to see in it.” Barth\r\nhad Max Müller in his mind’s eye when writing this. For the famous Oxford\r\nprofessor has throughout characterized the hymns of the _Rig Veda_, as the\r\nunsophisticated expression of the religious feeling of a pastoral innocent\r\npeople. “In the Vedic hymns the ideas and myths appear in their simplest\r\nand freshest form”—the Sanskrit scholar thinks. Barth is of a different\r\nopinion, however.\r\n\r\nSo divided and personal are the opinions of Sanskritists as to the\r\nimportance and intrinsic value of the _Rig Veda_, that these opinions\r\nbecome entirely biassed whichever way they incline. Thus Prof. Max Müller\r\ndeclares that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Nowhere is the wide distance which separates the ancient poems of\r\n    India from the most ancient literature of Greece more clearly\r\n    felt, than when we compare the growing myths of the Veda with the\r\n    full grown and decayed myths on which the poetry of Homer is\r\n    founded. The Veda is the real Theogony of the _Aryan races_, while\r\n    that of Hesiod is a distorted caricature of the original image.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a sweeping assertion, and perhaps rather unjust in its general\r\napplication. But why not try to account for it? Orientalists cannot do so,\r\nfor they reject the chronology of the Secret Doctrine, and can hardly\r\nadmit the fact that between the Rig Vedic hymns and Hesiod’s Theogony tens\r\nof thousands of years have elapsed. So they fail to see that the Greek\r\nmyths are no longer the primitive symbolical language of the Initiates,\r\nthe Disciples of the Gods‐Hierophants, the divine ancient “Sacrificers,”\r\nand that disfigured by the distance, and encumbered by the exuberant\r\ngrowth of human _profane_ fancy, they now stand like distorted images of\r\nstars in running waves. But if Hesiod’s Cosmogony and Theogony are to be\r\nviewed as caricatures of the original images, how much more so the myths\r\nin the Hebrew _Genesis_, in the sight of those for whom they are no more\r\ndivine revelation or the word of God, than is Hesiod’s Theogony for Mr.\r\nGladstone.\r\n\r\nAs Barth says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The poetry it [the _Rig Veda_] contains appears to me, on the\r\n    contrary, to be of a singularly refined character and artificially\r\n    elaborated, full of allusions and reticences, of pretensions [?]\r\n    to mysticism and theosophic insight; and the manner of its\r\n    expression is such as reminds one more frequently of the\r\n    phraseology in use among certain small groups of initiated than\r\n    the poetic language of a large community.(1030)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will not stop to enquire of the critic what he can know of the\r\nphraseology in use among the “initiated,” or whether he belongs himself to\r\nsuch a group; for, in the latter case, he would hardly have used such\r\nlanguage. But the above shows the remarkable disagreement between scholars\r\neven with regard to the _external_ character of the _Rig Veda_. What,\r\nthen, can any of the modern Sanskritists know about its _internal_ or\r\n_esoteric_ meaning, beyond the correct inference of Barth, that this\r\nScripture _has been compiled by Initiates_?\r\n\r\nThe whole of the present work is an endeavour to prove this truth. The\r\nancient Adepts have solved the great problems of Science, however\r\nunwilling modern Materialism may be to admit the fact. The mysteries of\r\nLife and Death _were_ fathomed by the great master‐minds of antiquity; and\r\nif they have preserved them in secresy and silence, it is because these\r\nproblems formed part of the Sacred Mysteries, which must have remained\r\nincomprehensible to the vast majority of men then, as they do now. If such\r\nteachings are still regarded as chimeras by our opponents in Philosophy,\r\nit may be a consolation to Theosophists to learn, on good proof, that the\r\nspeculations of modern Psychologists—whether serious Idealists, like Mr.\r\nHerbert Spencer, or wool‐gathering Pseudo‐idealists—are far more\r\nchimerical. Indeed, instead of resting on the firm foundation of facts in\r\nNature, they are the unhealthy will‐o’‐the‐wisps of materialistic\r\nimagination, of the brains that evolved them—and no more. While they deny,\r\nwe affirm; and our affirmation is corroborated by almost all the Sages of\r\nantiquity. Believing in Occultism and a host of invisible Potencies for\r\ngood reasons, we say, _Certus sum, scio quod credidi_; to which our\r\ncritics reply, _Credat Judæus Apella_. Neither is converted by the other,\r\nnor does such result affect even our little planet. _E pur se muove!_\r\n\r\nNor is there any need of proselytizing. As remarked by the wise Cicero:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Time destroys the speculations of man, but it confirms the\r\n    judgment of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us bide our time. Meanwhile, it is not in the human constitution to\r\nwitness in silence the destruction of one’s Gods, whether they be true or\r\nfalse. And as Theology and Materialism have combined together to destroy\r\nthe old Gods of antiquity and seek to disfigure every old philosophical\r\nconception, it is but just that the lovers of the Old Wisdom should defend\r\ntheir position, by proving that the whole arsenal of the two is, at best,\r\nformed of new weapons made out of very old material.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection II. Adam=Adami.\r\n\r\n\r\nNames such as Adam‐Adami, used by Dr. Chwolsohn in his _Nabathean\r\nAgriculture_ and derided by M. Renan, may prove little to the profane. To\r\nthe Occultist, however, once that the term is found in a work of such\r\nimmense antiquity as that above cited, it proves a good deal. It proves,\r\nfor instance, that Adami was a manifold symbol, originating with the Âryan\r\npeople, as the root word shows, and having been taken from them by the\r\nSemites and the Turanians—as many other things were.\r\n\r\nAdam‐Adami is a generic compound name as old as language is. The Secret\r\nDoctrine teaches that Ad‐i was the name given by the Âryans to the first\r\n_speaking_ race of mankind, in this Round. Hence the terms Adonim and\r\nAdonai (the ancient plural form of the word Adon), which the Jews applied\r\nto their Jehovah and Angels, who were simply the first spiritual and\r\nethereal sons of the Earth, and the God Adonis, who in his many variations\r\nstood for the “First Lord.” Adam is the Sanskrit Âdi‐Nâth, also meaning\r\nFirst Lord, as Âd‐Îshvara, or any Ad (the First) prefixed to an adjective\r\nor substantive. The reason for this is that such truths were a common\r\ninheritance. It was a revelation received by the _first_ mankind before\r\nthat time which, in biblical phraseology, is called “the period of one\r\n_lip_ and word,” or speech; knowledge expanded by man’s own intuition\r\nlater on, still later hidden from profanation under an adequate symbology.\r\nThe author of the _Qabbalah_, according to the philosophical writings of\r\nIbn Gebirol, shows the Israelites using Ad‐onaï (A Do Na Y), “Lord,”\r\ninstead of Eh’yeh, “I am,” and YHVH, and adds that, while Adonaï is\r\nrendered “Lord” in the _Bible_,\r\n\r\n\r\n    The lowest designation, or the Deity in Nature, the more general\r\n    term Elohim, is translated God.(1031)\r\n\r\n\r\nA curious work was translated in 1860 or thereabout, by the Orientalist\r\nChwolsohn, and presented to ever‐incredulous and flippant Europe under the\r\ninnocent title of _Nabathean Agriculture_. In the opinion of the\r\ntranslator that archaic volume _is a complete initiation_ into the\r\nmysteries of the Pre‐Adamite nations, on the authority of _undeniably\r\nauthentic documents_. It is an invaluable compendium, the full epitome of\r\nthe doctrines, arts and sciences, not only of the Chaldæans, but also of\r\nthe Assyrians and Canaanites of the pre‐historic ages.(1032) These\r\nNabatheans—as some critics thought—were simply the Sabæans, or Chaldæan\r\nstar‐worshippers. The work is a retranslation from the Arabic, into which\r\nlanguage it was at first translated from the Chaldæan.\r\n\r\nMasoudi, the Arabian historian, speaks of these Nabatheans, and explains\r\ntheir origin in this wise:\r\n\r\n\r\n    After the Deluge [?] the nations established themselves in various\r\n    countries. Among these were the Nabatheans, who founded the city\r\n    of Babylon, and were those descendants of Ham who settled in the\r\n    same province under the leadership of Nimrod, the son of Cush, who\r\n    was the son of Ham and great‐grandson of Noah. This took place at\r\n    the time when Nimrod received the governorship of Babylonia as the\r\n    delegate of Dzahhak named Biourasp.(1033)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe translator, Chwolsohn, finds that the assertions of this historian are\r\nin perfect accord with those of Moses in _Genesis_; while more irreverent\r\ncritics might express the opinion that for this very reason their truth\r\nshould be suspected. It is useless, however, to argue the point, which is\r\nof no value in the present question. The weather‐beaten, long‐since‐buried\r\nproblem, and the difficulty of accounting, on any logical ground, for the\r\nphenomenal derivation of millions of people of various races, of many\r\ncivilized nations and tribes, from _three_ couples—Noah’s sons and their\r\nwives—in 346 years(1034) after the Deluge, may be left to the Karma of the\r\nauthor of _Genesis_, whether he is called Moses or Ezra. That which is\r\ninteresting in the work under notice, however, are its contents, the\r\ndoctrines enunciated in it, which are again, if read Esoterically, almost\r\nall of them identical with the Secret Teachings.\r\n\r\nQuatremère suggested that this book might have been simply a copy made\r\nunder Nebuchadnezzar II from some Hamitic treatise, “infinitely more\r\nancient,” while the author maintains, on internal and external evidence,\r\nthat its Chaldæan original was written out from the oral discourses and\r\nteachings of a wealthy Babylonian landowner, named Qû‐tâmy, who had used\r\nfor those lectures still more ancient materials. The first Arabic\r\ntranslation is placed by Chwolsohn so far back as the thirteenth century\r\nB.C. On the first page of this “revelation,” the author, or amanuensis,\r\nQû‐tâmy, declares that “the doctrines propounded therein, _were originally\r\ntold by Saturn ... to the Moon, who communicated them to her idol,_” _and\r\nthe idol revealed them to her devotee, the writer_—the Adept Scribe of\r\nthat work—Qû‐tâmy.\r\n\r\nThe details given by the God for the benefit and instruction of mortals,\r\nshow periods of incalculable duration and a series of numberless kingdoms\r\nand Dynasties that preceded the appearance on Earth of Adami (the “red‐\r\nearth”). These periods, as might have been expected, have roused the\r\ndefenders of the chronology of the biblical dead‐letter meaning almost to\r\nfury. De Rougemont was the first to make a _levée_‐in‐arms against the\r\ntranslator. He reproaches him with _sacrificing_ Moses to anonymous\r\nauthors.(1035) Berosus, he urges, however great were _his chronological\r\nerrors_, was at least in perfect accord with the prophet with regard to\r\nthe first men, since he speaks of Alorus‐Adam, of Xisuthrus‐Noah, and of\r\nBelus‐Nimrod, etc. Therefore, he adds, the work must be an _apocryphon_ to\r\nbe ranged with its contemporaries—the _Fourth Book of Esdras_, the _Book\r\nof Enoch_, the _Sibylline Oracles_, and the _Book of Hermes_—_every one of\r\nthese dating no further back than two or three centuries B.C._ Ewald came\r\ndown still harder on Chwolsohn, and finally M. Renan, who in the _Revue\r\nGermanique_(1036) asks him to show reason why his _Nabathean Agriculture_\r\nshould not be the fraudulent work of some Jew of the third or fourth\r\ncentury of our era? It can hardly be otherwise—argues the romancer of the\r\n_Vie de Jésus_, since, in this _in‐folio_ on Astrology and Sorcery:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We recognize in the personages introduced Qû‐tâmy, all the\r\n    patriarchs of the biblical legends, such as Adam‐Adami, Anouka‐\r\n    Noah, and his Ibrahim‐Abraham, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut this is no reason, since Adam and others are generic names. Meanwhile\r\nit is humbly submitted that, all things considered, an _apocryphon_—if\r\neven of the third century A.D., instead of the thirteenth century B.C., is\r\nold enough to appear _genuine_ as a document, and so satisfy the demands\r\nof the most exacting archæologist and critic. For even admitting, for\r\nargument’s sake, that this literary relic has been compiled by “some Jew\r\nof the third century of our era”—what of that? Leaving the credibility of\r\nits doctrines for a moment aside, why should it be less entitled to a\r\nhearing, or less instructive as reflecting older opinions, than any other\r\nreligious work, also a “compilation from old texts” or oral tradition—of\r\nthe same or even a later age? In such case we should have to reject and\r\ncall “apocryphal” the _Kurân_—three centuries later, though we know it to\r\nhave sprung, Minerva‐like, direct from the brain of the Arabian prophet;\r\nand we should have to pooh‐pooh all the information we can get from the\r\n_Talmud_, which, in its present form, was also compiled from older\r\nmaterials, and is not earlier than the ninth century of our era.\r\n\r\nThis curious “Bible” of the Chaldæan Adept and the various criticisms upon\r\nit (as in Chwolsohn’s translation) are noticed, because it has an\r\nimportant bearing upon a great portion of the present work. With the\r\nexception of the contention of M. Renan, an iconoclast on principle—so\r\npointedly called by Jules Lemaître “_le Paganini du néant_”—the worst\r\nfault found with the work is, it would seem, that the _apocryphon_\r\npretends to have been communicated _as a revelation_ to an Adept by, and\r\nfrom, the “idol of the Moon,” who received it from “Saturn.” Hence, very\r\nnaturally, it is “a fairy tale all round.” To this there is but one\r\nanswer: It is no more a fairy tale than the _Bible_, and if one falls, the\r\nother must follow it. Even the mode of divination through “the idol of the\r\nMoon” is the same as that practised by David, Saul and the High Priests of\r\nthe Jewish Tabernacle by means of the Teraphim.\r\n\r\nThe _Nabathean Agriculture_ is a compilation indeed; it is no\r\n_apocryphon_, but the repetition of the tenets of the Secret Doctrine\r\nunder the exoteric Chaldæan form of national symbols, for the purpose of\r\n“cloaking” the tenets, just as the _Books of Hermes_ and the _Purânas_ are\r\nlike attempts by Egyptians and Hindûs. The work was as well known in\r\nantiquity as it was during the Middle Ages. Maimonides speaks of it, and\r\nrefers more than once to this Chaldæo‐Arabic MS., calling the Nabatheans\r\nby the name of their co‐religionists, the “star‐worshippers,” or Sabæans,\r\nbut yet failing to see in the disfigured word “Nabathean” the mystic name\r\nof the caste devoted to Nebo, the God of _Secret_ Wisdom, which shows on\r\nits face that the Nabatheans were an Occult Brotherhood.(1037) The\r\nNabatheans who, according to the Persian Yezidi, originally came to Syria\r\nfrom Busrah, were the degenerate members of that fraternity; still their\r\nreligion, even at that late day, was purely kabalistic.(1038) Nebo is the\r\nDeity of the Planet Mercury, and Mercury is the God of Wisdom, or Hermes,\r\nor Budha, which the Jews called Kokab (ככב), “the Lord on high, the\r\naspiring,” and the Greeks Nabo (Ναβώ), hence Nabatheans. Notwithstanding\r\nthat Maimonides calls their doctrines “heathenish foolishness” and their\r\narchaic literature “_Sabæorum fœtum_,” he places their “agriculture,” the\r\nBible of Qû‐tâmy, in the first rank of archaic literature; and Abarbanel\r\npraises it in unmeasured terms. Spencer,(1039) quoting the latter, speaks\r\nof it as that “most excellent oriental work,” adding that by Nabatheans,\r\nthe Sabæans, the Chaldæans, and the Egyptians, in short all those nations\r\n_against whom the laws of Moses were most severely enacted_, have to be\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nNebo, the oldest God of Wisdom of Babylonia and Mesopotamia, was identical\r\nwith the Hindû Budha and the Hermes‐Mercury of the Greeks. A slight change\r\nin the sexes of the parents is the only alteration. As Budha was the Son\r\nof Soma (the Moon) in India, and of the wife of Brihaspati (Jupiter), so\r\nNebo was the son of Zarpanitu (the Moon) and of Merodach, who became\r\nJupiter, after having been a Sun‐god. As Mercury the Planet, Nebo was the\r\n“overseer” among the seven Gods of the Planets; and as the personification\r\nof the Secret Wisdom he was Nabin, a seer and a prophet. Moses is made to\r\ndie and disappear on the mount sacred to Nebo. This shows him to have been\r\nan Initiate, and a priest of that God under another name; for this God of\r\nWisdom was the great Creative Deity, and was worshipped as such. And this\r\nnot only at Borsippa in his gorgeous Temple, or Planet‐tower; he was\r\nlikewise adored by the Moabites, the Canaanites, the Assyrians, and\r\nthroughout the whole of Palestine. Then why not by the Israelites? “The\r\nplanetary temple of Babylon” had its “Holy of Holies” within the shrine of\r\nNebo, the Prophet‐God of Wisdom. We are told in the Hibbert Lectures:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The ancient Babylonians had an intercessor between men and the\r\n    gods ... and Nebo, was the “proclaimer” or “prophet,” as he made\r\n    known the desire of his father Merodach.(1040)\r\n\r\n\r\nNebo is a Creator, like Budha, of the Fourth, and also of the Fifth, Race.\r\nFor the former starts a new race of Adepts, and the latter, the Solar‐\r\nLunar Dynasty, or the men of these Races and Round. Both are the Adams of\r\ntheir respective creatures. Adam‐Adami is a personation of the _dual_\r\nAdam: of the paradigmatic Adam‐Kadmon, the Creator, and of the lower Adam,\r\nthe terrestrial, who, as the Syrian Kabalists have it, had only Nephesh,\r\nthe “breath of life,” but _no Living Soul_, until after his Fall.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, Renan persists in regarding the Chaldæan Scriptures—or what\r\nremains of them—as apocryphal, it is quite immaterial to truth and fact.\r\nThere are other Orientalists who may be of a different opinion; and even\r\nwere they not, it would still really matter very little. These doctrines\r\ncontain the teachings of Esoteric Philosophy, and this must suffice. To\r\nthose who understand nothing of symbology it may appear astrolatry, pure\r\nand simple, or to him who would conceal the Esoteric Truth, even\r\n“heathenish foolishness.” Maimonides, however, while expressing scorn for\r\nthe Esotericism in the religion of other nations, confessed Esotericism\r\nand Symbology in his own, preached silence and secrecy upon the true\r\nmeaning of Mosaic sayings, and thus came to grief. The Doctrines of\r\nQû‐tâmy, the Chaldæan, are, in short, the allegorical rendering of the\r\nreligion of the earliest nations of the Fifth Race.\r\n\r\nWhy then should M. Renan treat the name “Adam‐Adami” with such academical\r\ncontempt? The author of the _Origins of Christianity_ evidently knows\r\nnothing of the origins of Pagan symbolism or of Esotericism either,\r\notherwise he would have known that the name Adam‐Adami was a form of a\r\nuniversal symbol, referring, _even with the Jews_, not to one man, but to\r\nfour distinct humanities or mankinds. This is very easily proven.\r\n\r\nThe Kabalists teach the existence of four distinct Adams, or the\r\ntransformation of four consecutive Adams, the emanations from the\r\nDyooknah, or Divine Phantom, of the Heavenly Man, an ethereal combination\r\nof Neshamah, the highest Soul or Spirit; this Adam having, of course,\r\nneither a gross human body, nor a _body of desire_. This Adam is the\r\nPrototype (Tzure) of the second Adam. That they represent our Five Races,\r\nis certain, as everyone can see by their description in the _Kabalah_. The\r\nfirst is the Perfect Holy Adam, “a shadow that disappeared” (the Kings of\r\nEdom), produced from the divine Tzelem (Image); the second is called the\r\nProtoplastic Androgyne Adam of the future terrestrial and separated Adam;\r\nthe third Adam is the man made of “dust” (the first, Innocent Adam); and\r\nthe fourth, is the supposed forefather of our own race—the Fallen Adam.\r\nSee, however, the admirably clear description of these in Isaac Myer’s\r\n_Qabbalah_. He gives only four Adams, because of the Kings of Edom, no\r\ndoubt, and adds:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The fourth Adam ... was clothed with skin, flesh, nerves, etc.\r\n    This answers to the Lower _Nephesh_ and _Guff_, _i.e._, body,\r\n    united. He has the animal power of reproduction and continuance of\r\n    species.(1041)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the _human_ Root‐Race.\r\n\r\nIt is just at this point that the modern Kabalists—led into error by the\r\nlong generations of Christian Mystics who have tampered with the\r\nkabalistic records wherever they could—diverge from the Occultists in\r\ntheir interpretations, and take the later thought for the earlier idea.\r\nThe original _Kabalah_ was entirely metaphysical, and had no concern with\r\nanimal, or terrestrial, sexes; the later _Kabalah_ has suffocated the\r\ndivine ideal under the heavy phallic element. The Kabalists say: “God made\r\nman male and female.” Says the author of the _Qabbalah_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Among the Qabbalists, the necessity to continued creation and\r\n    existence is called the Balance.(1042)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd being without this “Balance,” connected with Maqom (the mysterious\r\n“Place”),(1043) even the First Race is not, as we have seen, recognized by\r\nthe Sons of the Fifth Adam. From the highest Heavenly Man, the Upper Adam\r\nwho is “male‐female” or Androgyne, down to the Adam of dust, these\r\npersonified symbols are all connected with sex and procreation. With the\r\nEastern Occultists it is entirely the reverse. The sexual relation they\r\nconsider as a “Karma” pertaining only to the mundane relation of man, who\r\nis dominated by Illusion, a thing to be put aside, the moment that the\r\nperson becomes “wise.” They considered it a most fortunate circumstance if\r\nthe Guru (teacher) found in his pupil an aptitude for the pure life of\r\nBrahmâchârya. Their dual symbols were to them but the poetical imagery of\r\nthe sublime correlation of creative cosmic forces. And this ideal\r\nconception is found beaming like a golden ray upon each idol, however\r\ncoarse and grotesque, in the crowded galleries of the sombre fanes of\r\nIndia and other mother‐lands of cults.\r\n\r\nThis will be demonstrated in the following Section.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, it may be added that, with the Gnostics, the second Adam also\r\nemanates from the Primeval Man, the Ophite Adamas, in “whose image he is\r\nmade”; the third, from this second—an Androgyne. The latter is symbolized\r\nin the sixth and seventh pairs of the male‐female Æons, Amphain‐Essumen\r\n(Ἀμφαὶν Ἐσσουμὲν), and Vananin‐Lamertade (Οὐανανίν Λαμερτάδε)—Father and\r\nMother(1044)—while the fourth Adam, or Race, is represented by a Priapean\r\nmonster. The latter—a Post‐Christian fancy—is the degraded copy of the\r\nAnte‐Christian Gnostic symbol of the “Good One,” or “He, _who created\r\nbefore anything existed_,” the Celestial Priapus—truly born from Venus and\r\nBacchus _when that God returned from his expedition into India_, for Venus\r\nand Bacchus are the post‐types of Aditi and the Spirit. The later Priapus,\r\none, however, with Agathodæmon, the Gnostic Saviour, and even with\r\nAbraxas, is no longer the glyph for _abstract creative_ Power, but\r\nsymbolizes the four Adams, or Races, the fifth being represented by the\r\n_five_ branches cut off from the Tree of Life on which the old man stands\r\nin the Gnostic gems. The number of the Root‐Races was recorded in the\r\nancient Greek temples by the seven vowels, of which _five_ were framed in\r\na panel in the Initiation Halls of the Adyta. The Egyptian glyph for it\r\nwas a hand with five fingers spread out, the fifth or little finger being\r\nonly half‐grown, and also _five_ “N’s”—hieroglyphs standing for that\r\nletter. The Romans used the five vowels A E I O V in their fanes; and this\r\narchaic symbol was adopted during the Middle Ages as a motto by the House\r\nof the Hapsburgs. _Sic transit gloria!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection III. The “Holy of Holies.” Its Degradation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sanctum Sanctorum of the Ancients, also called the Adytum—the recess\r\nat the West end of the Temple which was enclosed on three sides by blank\r\nwalls and had its only aperture or door hung over with a curtain—was\r\ncommon to all ancient nations.\r\n\r\nA great difference is now found between the secret meaning of this\r\nsymbolical place as given in the Esotericism of the Pagans and in that of\r\nthe later Jews, though its symbology was originally identical throughout\r\nthe ancient races and nations. The _Gentiles_ placed in the Adytum a\r\n_sarcophagus_, or a tomb (_taphos_), in which was the Solar God to whom\r\nthe temple was consecrated, holding it, as Pantheists, in the greatest\r\nveneration. They regarded it, in its Esoteric meaning, as the symbol of\r\n_resurrection_, cosmic, solar, or diurnal, and human. It embraced the wide\r\nrange of periodical, and (in time) punctual, Manvantaras, or the\r\nreäwakenings of Kosmos, Earth, and Man to new existences; the Sun being\r\nthe most poetical and also the most grandiose symbol of such Cycles in\r\nHeaven, and man—in his reïncarnations—on Earth. The _Jews_—whose realism,\r\nif judged by the dead‐letter, was as practical and gross in the days of\r\nMoses as it is now(1045)—in the course of their estrangement from the Gods\r\nof their Pagan neighbours, consummated a national and levitical polity, by\r\nthe device of setting forth their Holy of Holies as the most solemn sign\r\nof their Monotheism—exoterically, while seeing in it but a universal\r\nphallic symbol—esoterically. While the Kabalists knew but Ain Suph and the\r\n“Gods” of the Mysteries, the Levites had no tomb, no God in their Adytum\r\nbut the “Sacred” Ark of the Covenant—their “Holy of Holies.”\r\n\r\nWhen the esoteric meaning of this recess is made clear, however, the\r\nprofane will be better able to understand why David danced “uncovered”\r\nbefore the _Ark_ of the Covenant, and was so anxious to appear _vile_ for\r\nthe sake of his “Lord,” and _base_ in his own sight.(1046)\r\n\r\nThe Ark is the navi‐form Argha of the Mysteries. Parkhurst, who has a long\r\ndissertation upon it in his Greek dictionary, and who never breathes a\r\nword about it in his Hebrew lexicon, explains it thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Archê (Ἀρχὴ) in this application answers to the Hebrew Rasit or\r\n    wisdom, ... a word which had the meaning of the emblem of the\r\n    female generative power, the Arg or Arca, in which the germ of all\r\n    nature was supposed to float or brood on the great abyss during\r\n    the interval which took place after every mundane cycle.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuite so; and the Jewish Ark of the Covenant had _precisely the same\r\nsignificance_; with the supplementary addition that, instead of a\r\nbeautiful and chaste sarcophagus (the symbol of the Matrix of Nature and\r\nResurrection), as in the Sanctum Sanctorum of the Pagans, they had the Ark\r\nmade still more _realistic_ in its construction by the two Cherubs set up\r\non the coffer or Ark of the Covenant, facing each other, with their wings\r\nspread in such a manner as to form a perfect Yoni (as now seen in India).\r\nBesides which, this generative symbol had its significance enforced by the\r\nfour mystic letters of Jehovah’s name, namely, IHVH (יהוה); Jod (י)\r\nmeaning the _membrum virile_; Hé (ה), the _womb_; Vau (ו), a crook or a\r\nhook, a nail, and Hé (ה) again, meaning also “an opening”; the whole\r\nforming the perfect _bisexual_ emblem or symbol or I(e)H(o)V(a)H, the male\r\nand female symbol.\r\n\r\nPerhaps also, when people realize the true meaning of the office and title\r\nof the Kadesh Kadeshim, the “holy ones,” or “the consecrated to the\r\n_Temple of the Lord_”—the “Holy of Holies” of these “holy ones” may assume\r\nan aspect far from edifying.\r\n\r\nIacchus again is Iao or Jehovah; and Baal or Adon, like Bacchus, was a\r\nphallic God.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Who shall ascend into the hill [the high place] of the Lord?”\r\n    asks the holy king David, “Who shall stand in the place of his\r\n    Kadushu (קדשו)?”(1047) Kadesh may mean in one sense to “devote,”\r\n    “hallow,” “sanctify,” and even to “initiate” or to “set apart”;\r\n    but it also means the ministry of lascivious rites—the Venus‐\r\n    worship—and the true interpretation of the word Kadesh is bluntly\r\n    rendered in _Deuteronomy_, xxiii. 17; _Hosea_, iv. 14; and\r\n    _Genesis_, xxxviii. 15‐22. The “holy” Kadeshim of the _Bible_ were\r\n    identical, as to the duties of their office, with the Nautch‐girls\r\n    of the later Hindû pagodas. The Hebrew Kadeshim, or Galli, lived\r\n    “by the house of the Lord, where the women wove hangings for the\r\n    grove,” or the bust of Venus‐Astarte.(1048)\r\n\r\n    The dance performed by David round the Ark was the “circle‐dance,”\r\n    said to have been prescribed by the Amazons for the Mysteries.\r\n    Such was the dance of the daughters of Shiloh,(1049) and the\r\n    leaping of the prophets of Baal.(1050) It was simply a\r\n    characteristic of the Sabæan worship, for it denoted the motion of\r\n    the Planets round the Sun. That the dance was a Bacchic frenzy is\r\n    apparent. Sistra were used on the occasion, and the taunt of\r\n    Michal and the King’s reply are very expressive.(1051)\r\n\r\n    The Ark, in which are preserved the germs of all living things\r\n    necessary to repeople the Earth, represents the survival of life,\r\n    and the supremacy of Spirit over Matter, through the conflict of\r\n    the opposing powers of Nature. In the Astro‐theosophic chart of\r\n    the Western Rite, the Ark corresponds with the navel, and is\r\n    placed at the sinister side, the side of the woman (the Moon), one\r\n    of whose symbols is the left pillar of Solomon’s Temple—Boaz. The\r\n    umbilicus is connected (through the placenta) with the receptacle\r\n    in which are fructified the embryos of the race. The Ark is the\r\n    sacred Argha of the Hindûs, and thus the relation in which it\r\n    stands to Noah’s Ark may be easily inferred when we learn that the\r\n    Argha was an oblong vessel, used by the high priests as a\r\n    sacrificial chalice in the worship of Isis, Astarte, and Venus‐\r\n    Aphrodite, all of whom were Goddesses of the generative powers of\r\n    Nature, or of Matter—hence representing symbolically the Ark\r\n    containing the germs of all living things.(1052)\r\n\r\n\r\nMistaken is he who accepts the kabalistic works of to‐day, and the\r\ninterpretations of the _Zohar_ by the Rabbis, for the genuine kabalistic\r\nlore of old!(1053) For no more to‐day than in the day of Frederick von\r\nSchelling does the _Kabalah_ accessible to Europe and America contain much\r\nmore than\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ruins and fragments, much distorted, remnants still of that\r\n    _primitive system which is the key to all religious\r\n    systems_.(1054)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe oldest system and the Chaldæan _Kabalah_ were identical. The latest\r\nrenderings of the _Zohar_ are those of the Synagogue in the early\r\ncenturies—_i.e._, the Thorah (or Law), dogmatic and uncompromising.\r\n\r\nThe “King’s Chamber” in Cheops’ Pyramid is thus an Egyptian “Holy of\r\nHolies.” On the days of the Mysteries of Initiation, the Candidate,\r\nrepresenting the Solar God, had to descend into the Sarcophagus, and\r\nrepresent the energizing ray, entering into the fecund womb of Nature.\r\nEmerging from it on the following morning, he typified the resurrection of\r\nLife after the change called Death. In the Great Mysteries his figurative\r\n“death” lasted two days, when with the Sun he arose on the third morning,\r\nafter a last night of the most cruel trials. While the Postulant\r\nrepresented the Sun—the all‐vivifying orb that “resurrects” every morning\r\nbut to impart life to all—the Sarcophagus was symbolic of the female\r\nprinciple. This, in Egypt; its form and shape changed with every country,\r\nprovided it remained a vessel, a symbolic “navis” or boat‐shaped vehicle,\r\nand a “container,” symbolically, of germs or the germ of life. In India,\r\nit is the “Golden” Cow through which the Candidate for Brâhmanism has to\r\npass if he desires to be a Brâhman, and to become _Dvi_‐ja, “born a\r\n_second_ time.” The crescent‐form Argha of the Greeks was the type of the\r\nQueen of Heaven—Diana, or the Moon. She was the Great Mother of all\r\nExistences, as the Sun was the Father. The Jews, previous to, as well as\r\nafter, their metamorphosis of Jehovah into a _male_ God, worshipped\r\nAstoreth, which made Isaiah declare: “_Your new moons and ... feasts_ my\r\nsoul hateth”;(1055) in saying which, he was evidently unjust. Astoreth and\r\nthe New Moon (the crescent Argha) Festivals, had no worse significance as\r\na form of public worship than had the hidden meaning of the Moon in\r\ngeneral, which was kabalistically connected directly with, and sacred to,\r\nJehovah, as is well known; with the sole difference, however, that one was\r\nthe female and the other the male aspect of the Moon, and of the star\r\nVenus.\r\n\r\nThe Sun (the Father), the Moon (the Mother), and Mercury‐Thoth (the Son),\r\nwere the earliest Trinity of the Egyptians, who personified them in\r\nOsiris, Isis, and Thoth (Hermes). In the Gnostic Gospel _Pistis Sophia_,\r\nthe seven Great Gods, divided into two Triads and the highest God (the\r\nSun), are the lower Triple Powers (Τριδυνάμεις), whose powers reside\r\nrespectively in Mars, Mercury and Venus; and the higher Triad—the three\r\n“Unseen Gods,” who dwell in the Moon, Jupiter and Saturn.(1056)\r\n\r\nThis requires no proof. Astoreth was in one sense an impersonal symbol of\r\nNature, the Ship of Life carrying throughout the boundless Sidereal Ocean\r\nthe germs of all being. And when she was not identified with Venus, like\r\nevery other “Queen of Heaven” to whom cakes and buns were offered in\r\nsacrifice, Astoreth became the reflection of the Chaldæan “Nuah, the\r\nUniversal Mother” (the female Noah, considered as one with the Ark), and\r\nof the female Triad, Ana, Belita and Davkina; called, when blended into\r\none, “Sovereign Goddess, Lady of the Nether Abyss, Mother of Gods, Queen\r\nof the Earth, and Queen of Fecundity.” Later, Belita or Tamtu(1057) (the\r\nsea), the Mother of the City of Erech (the great Chaldæan Necropolis),\r\nbecame Eve; and now she is Mary the Virgin, in the Latin Church,\r\nrepresented as standing on the Crescent Moon, and, at times on the Globe,\r\nto vary the programme. The Navis, or ship‐like form of the crescent, which\r\nblends in itself all those common symbols of the Ship of Life, such as\r\nNoah’s Ark, the Yoni of the Hindûs, and the Ark of the Covenant, is the\r\nfemale symbol of the Universal “Mother of the Gods,” and is now found\r\nunder its Christian symbol in every Church, as the “nave” (from\r\n_navis_).(1058) The Navis, the Sidereal Vessel, is fructified by the\r\nSpirit of Life—the male God; or, as the learned Kenealy, in his\r\n_Apocalypse_, very appropriately calls it—the Holy Spirit. In Western\r\nreligious symbology the crescent was the male, the full Moon the female,\r\naspect of that universal Spirit. The mystic word ALM, which the prophet\r\nMahomet prefixed to many chapters of the _Korân_, alludes to _her_ as the\r\nAlm, the Immaculate Virgin of the Heavens.(1059) And—the sublime ever\r\nfalling into the ridiculous—it is from this root Alm that we have to\r\nderive the word Almeh—the Egyptian dancing‐girls. The latter are “virgins”\r\nof the same type as the Nautchees in India, and the (female) Kadeshim, the\r\n“holy ones” of the Jewish temples—consecrated to Jehovah, who represented\r\nboth sexes—whose _holy_ functions in the Israelite fanes were _identical_\r\nwith those of the Nautchees.\r\n\r\nNow Eustathius declares that IO (ΙΩ) means the Moon, in the dialect of the\r\nArgians; it was also one of the names of the Moon in Egypt. Says\r\nJablonski:\r\n\r\n\r\n    ΙΩ, _Ioh, Ægyptiis Lunam significat neque habent illi, in communi\r\n    sermonis usu, aliud nomen quo Lunam designent præter IO_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pillar and Circle (IO), which with Pythagoras was the perfect number\r\ncontained in the Tetraktys,(1060) became later a _preëminently phallic_\r\nnumber—amongst the Jews, foremost of all, with whom it is the male and\r\nfemale Jehovah.\r\n\r\nThis is how a scholar explains it:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I find, on the Rosetta stone of Uhlemann, the word _mooth_ (also\r\n    in Seiffarth), the name of the _moon_, used as a cycle of time,\r\n    hence the lunar month, from the hieroglyph [Symbol: half circle],\r\n    with [Symbol: five‐pointed star] and [Symbol: circle with middle\r\n    dot] as determinatives, given as the Coptic I O H, or I O H. The\r\n    Hebrew הוי may also be used as I O H, for the letter _vau_ (ו) was\r\n    used for _o_ and for _u_, and for _v_ or _w_. This, before the\r\n    Massora, of which the point (·) was used as וֹ = o, וּ = u, and ו\r\n    = v or w. Now I had worked it out by original search that the\r\n    great distinctive function of the god‐name Jehovah was designative\r\n    of the influence of the moon as the _causative_ of _generation_,\r\n    and as of its exact value as a lunar year in the natural _measure\r\n    of days_, as you will fully see,... And here comes this linguistic\r\n    same word from a source far more ancient; viz., the Coptic, or\r\n    rather from the old Egyptian in time of the Coptic.(1061)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the more remarkable when Egyptology compares this with the little\r\nwhich it knows about the Theban Triad—composed of Ammon, Mooth (or Moot),\r\nand their son Khonsoo. This Triad was, when united, contained in the Moon\r\nas their common symbol; and when separated, it was Khonsoo who was the God\r\nLunus, being thus confounded with Thoth and Phtah. His mother Moot—the\r\nname signifying “Mother,” by the bye, and not the Moon, which was only her\r\nsymbol—is called the “Queen of Heaven,” the “Virgin,” etc., as she is an\r\naspect of Isis, Hathor, and other Mother Goddesses. She was less the wife\r\nthan the mother of Ammon, whose distinct title is the “husband of his\r\nmother.” In a statuette at Boulaq, Cairo, this Triad is represented as a\r\nmummy‐god holding in his hand three different sceptres, and bearing the\r\nlunar disk on his head, the characteristic tress of hair showing the\r\ndesign of representing it as that of an _infant_ God, or the “Sun,” in the\r\nTriad. He was the God of Destinies in Thebes, and appears under two\r\naspects (1) as Khonsoo, the Lunar God, and Lord of Thebes, Nofir‐hotpoo,\r\n“he who is in absolute repose,” and (2) as “Khonsoo p. iri‐sokhroo,” or\r\n“Khonsoo, who executes Destiny”; the former preparing the events and\r\nconceiving them for those born under his generative influence, the latter\r\nputting them into action.(1062) Under theogonic permutations Ammon becomes\r\nHorus, Hor‐Ammon, and Moot(h)‐Isis is seen suckling him in a statuette of\r\nthe Saïtic period.(1063) In his turn, in this transformed Triad, Khonsoo\r\nbecomes Thoth‐Lunus, “he who operates salvation.” His brow is crowned with\r\nthe head of an ibis decorated with the lunar disk and the diadem called\r\nIo‐tef (IO‐tef).(1064)\r\n\r\nNow all these symbols are certainly found reflected in (some believe them\r\nidentical with) the Yave, or Jehovah of the _Bible_. This will be made\r\nplain to anyone who reads _The Source of Measures_, or “The Hebrew‐\r\nEgyptian Mystery,” and understands its undeniable, clear, and mathematical\r\nproofs that the _esoteric foundations_, or the system used in the building\r\nof the Great Pyramid, and the architectural measurements in the Temple of\r\nSolomon (whether the latter be mythical or real), Noah’s Ark, and the Ark\r\nof the Covenant, are the same. If anything in the world can settle the\r\ndispute that the old, as much as the later Post‐Babylonian, Jews, and\r\nespecially the former, built their Theogony and Religion on the very same\r\nfoundation as did all the Pagans, it is the work in question.\r\n\r\nAnd now it may be as well to remind the reader of what we said of IAO in\r\n_Isis Unveiled_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    No other deity affords such a variety of etymologies as Iaho, nor\r\n    is there any name which can be so variously pronounced. It is only\r\n    by associating it with the Masoretic points that the later Rabbins\r\n    succeeded in making Jehovah read “Adonaï”—or Lord. Philo Byblus\r\n    spells it in Greek letters ΙΕΥΩ—IEVO. Theodoret says that the\r\n    Samaritans pronounced it Iabé (Yahva), and the Jews Yaho; which\r\n    would make it as we have shown, I—Ah—O. Diodorus states that\r\n    “among the Jews they relate that Moses called the God IAO.” It is\r\n    on the authority of the _Bible_ itself, that we maintain that,\r\n    before his initiation by Jethro, his father‐in‐law, Moses had\r\n    never known the word Iaho.(1065)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above receives corroboration in a private letter from a very learned\r\nKabalist. In our first volume,(1066) it is stated that exoterically Brahma\r\n(neuter), so flippantly and so often confused by the Orientalists with\r\nBrahmâ (the male), is sometimes called Kâla‐hansa, the “Swan in Eternity,”\r\nand the Esoteric meaning of Aham‐sa, is given as “I [am] he,” So‐ham being\r\nequal to Sah “he,” and Aham “I”—a mystic anagram and permutation. It is\r\nalso the “four‐faced” Brahmâ, the Chatur‐mukham (the Perfect Cube) forming\r\nitself _within_, and _from_, the Infinite Circle; and again the use of the\r\n1, 3, 5, and 7/7 = 14, as the Esoteric Hierarchy of the Dhyân Chohans, is\r\nexplained. On this, the said correspondent comments in the following\r\nmanner:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Of the 1, 3, 5, and twice 7, intending, and very especially,\r\n    13514, which on a circle may be read as 31415 (or π value), I\r\n    think there cannot be a possibility of doubting; and especially\r\n    when considered with symbol marks on Sacr’,(1067) “Chakra,” or\r\n    Circle of Vishnu.\r\n\r\n    But let me carry your description a step further: You say, “The\r\n    One from the Egg, the _Six_, and the _Five_,(1068) give the\r\n    numbers 1065, the value of the First‐born.” If it be so, then in\r\n    1065 we have the famous Jehovah’s name, the Jve or Jave, or\r\n    Jupiter, and by change of ה to נ, or _h_ to _n_, then נוי or the\r\n    Latin Jun or Juno, the base of the Chinese riddle, the key\r\n    measuring numbers of Sni (Sinai) and Jehovah coming down on that\r\n    Mount, which numbers (1065) are but the use of our ratio of 113 to\r\n    355, because 1065 = 355 × 3 which is circumference to a diameter\r\n    of 113 × 3 = 339. Thus the first born of Brahmâ‐Prajâpati (or any\r\n    Demiurgus) indicates a measuring use of a circular relation taken\r\n    from the Chakra (or Vishnu) and, as stated above, the Divine\r\n    Manifestation takes the form of Life and the First‐born.\r\n\r\n           [Illustration: Slope of entrance to King’s Chamber]\r\n\r\n    It is a most singular thing: At the entrance passage to the King’s\r\n    Chamber the measurement _from the surface_ of the Great Step(1069)\r\n    and the Grand Gallery to the top of the said Gallery is, by the\r\n    very careful measures of Piazzi Smyth, 339 inches. Take _a_ as a\r\n    centre and with this radius describe a circle; the diameter of\r\n    that circle will be 339 × 2 = 678, and these numbers are those of\r\n    the expression _and the raven_, in the “dove and raven” scenes or\r\n    pictures of the Flood of Noah; (the radius is taken to show\r\n    division into two parts, which are 1065 each) for 113 (_man_) × 6\r\n    = 678, and the diameter to a circumference of 1065 × 2—so we have\r\n    here an indication of cosmic _man_ on this high grade or step, at\r\n    the _entrance_ of the King’s Chamber (the Holy of Holies)—_which\r\n    is the womb_. Now this passage is of such a height that a man to\r\n    enter it _must stoop_. But a man _upright_ is 113, and broken, or\r\n    stooping, he becomes 113/2 = 56·5 or 5·65 x 10 (יהוה), or Jehovah.\r\n    That is, he personifies(1070) him as entering the Holy of Holies.\r\n    But by Hebrew Esotericism the _chief function_ of Jehovah was\r\n    _child giving_, etc., and that because, by the numbers of his\r\n    name, he was the _measure of the lunar year_, which cycle of\r\n    time—because by its factor of 7 (seven) it ran so coördinately\r\n    with the periods of the quickening, viability, and gestation—was\r\n    taken as the _causative of the generative action_ and therefore\r\n    was worshipped and besought.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis discovery connects Jehovah still more with all the other Creative and\r\nGenerative Gods, Solar and Lunar, and especially with “King” Soma, the\r\nHindû Deus Lunus, the Moon, because of the Esoteric influence attributed\r\nto this Planet in Occultism. There are other corroborations of this,\r\nhowever, in Hebrew tradition itself. Adam is spoken of in the _More\r\nNevochim_ (or “Guide of the Perplexed”—truly!) of Maimonides in two\r\naspects; as a man, like all others born of a man and a woman, and—as the\r\n_Prophet of the Moon_; the reason of which is now made apparent, and has\r\nto be explained.\r\n\r\nAdam, as the supposed great “Progenitor of the Human Race,” is, as Adam\r\nKadmon, made in the _image_ of God—a priapic image, therefore. The Hebrew\r\nwords Sacr’ and N’cabvah are, literally translated, Lingam (Phallus) and\r\nYoni (Cteïs), notwithstanding their translation in the _Bible_ “male and\r\nfemale.”(1071) As said there, “God creates ‘_man in his own image_,’ in\r\nthe image of God created he him; _male and female_ created he them”—the\r\nandrogyne Adam Kadmon. Now this kabalistic name is not that of a living\r\nman, nor even of a human or divine Being, but of the two sexes or organs\r\nof procreation, called in Hebrew with that usual sincerity of language\r\npreëminently biblical, Sacr’ and N’cabvah(1072); these two being,\r\ntherefore, the _image_ under which the “Lord God” appeared usually to his\r\nchosen people. That this is so, is now undeniably proven by almost all the\r\nsymbologists and Hebrew scholars as well as by the _Kabalah_. Therefore\r\nAdam is in one sense Jehovah. This makes plain another general tradition\r\nin the East mentioned in Gregorie’s _Notes and Observations upon several\r\nPassages in Scripture_,(1073) and quoted by Hargrave Jennings in his\r\n_Phallicism_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    That Adam was commanded by God that his dead body should be kept\r\n    above ground till a fulness of time should come to commit it ...\r\n    to the _middle of the earth_ by a priest of the Most High God....\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore,\r\n\r\nNoah daily prayed in the Ark before the “Body of Adam”—(1074)\r\n\r\nor before the Phallus in the Ark, or Holy of Holies, again. He who is a\r\nKabalist and accustomed to the incessant permutation of biblical names,\r\nonce they are interpreted numerically and symbolically, will understand\r\nwhat is meant.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The two words of which Jehovah is composed, make up the original\r\n    idea of male‐female, as birth‐originator, for the י was the\r\n    _membrum virile_ and _Hovah_ was _Eve_. So ... the _perfect one_,\r\n    as originator of measures, takes also the form of _birth_ origin,\r\n    as _hermaphrodite one_; hence, the phallic use of form.(1075)\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides, the same author shows and demonstrates numerically and\r\ngeometrically that (_a_) Arets, “earth,” Adam, “man,” and H‐adam‐h, are\r\ncognate with each other, and are _personified_ in the _Bible_ under one\r\nform, as the Egyptian and Hebrew Mars, God of Generation;(1076) and (_b_)\r\nthat Jehovah, or Jah, is Noah, for _Jehovah is Noah_ in Hebrew would be\r\nינח or literally in English, _Inch_.\r\n\r\nThe above affords, then, a key to the said traditions. Noah, a divine\r\npermutation, the supposed Saviour of Humanity, who carries in his Ark or\r\nArgha (the Moon), the germs of all living things, worships before the\r\n“Body of Adam,” which body is the image of the Creator, and a Creator\r\nitself. Hence Adam is called the “Prophet of the Moon,” the Argha or “Holy\r\nof Holies” of the Yod (י). This also shows the origin of the Jewish\r\npopular belief that the face of Moses _is in the Moon_—_i.e._, the spots\r\nin the Moon. For Moses and Jehovah are kabalistically once more\r\npermutations, as has been shown. Says the author of _The Source of\r\nMeasures_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    There is one fact in regard to Moses and his works too important\r\n    to be omitted. When he is instructed by the Lord as to his\r\n    mission, the _power_ name assumed by the Deity is, _I am that I\r\n    am_, the Hebrew words being\r\n\r\n    אהיה אשר אהיה ;\r\n\r\n    a various reading of יהוה. Now, Moses is משה, and equals\r\n\r\n    345.\r\n\r\n    Add the values of the _new form_ of the name Jehovah, 21 + 501 +\r\n    21 = 543, or, by a reverse reading, 345; thus showing Moses to be\r\n    a form of Jehovah in this combination. 21 ÷ 2 = 105, or, reversed,\r\n    501, so that the _asher_ or the _that_ in _I am‐that‐I am_ is\r\n    simply a guide to a use of 21 or 7 × 3.501^2 = 251 +, a very\r\n    valuable pyramid number, etc.(1077)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a clearer explanation for the benefit of Non‐Kabalists we put it thus:\r\n“I am that I am” is in Hebrew:\r\n\r\nÂhiyé is ה י ה א, or 5 10 5 1.\r\n\r\nAsher is ר ש א, or 200 300 1.\r\n\r\nÂhiyé is ה י ה א, or 5 10 5 1.\r\n\r\nAdd the numbers of these separate words and you have:\r\n\r\nאהיה (21) אשר (501) אהיה (21).\r\n\r\nThis relates to the process of descending in Fire on the Mount to make\r\nMan, etc., and is explained to be but a _check_ and use of the numbers of\r\nthe mountains; for on one side we have 10 + 5 + 6 = 21, down the middle\r\n501, and on the other side 6 + 5 + 10 = 21.(1078)\r\n\r\nThe “Holy of Holies,” both kabalistic and rabbinical, is thus shown as an\r\ninternational symbol, and common property. Neither had originated with the\r\nHebrews; but owing to the too realistic handling of the half‐initiated\r\nLevites, the symbol had acquired with them a significance which it\r\nscarcely has with any other people to this day, and which it was\r\noriginally never meant to have by the true Kabalist. The Lingam and Yoni\r\nof the modern average Hindû is, on the face of it, of course, no better\r\nthan the rabbinical “Holy of Holies”—but _it is no worse_; and this is a\r\npoint gained on the Christian traducers of the Asiatic religious\r\nPhilosophies. For, in such religious myths, in the hidden symbolism of a\r\ncreed and philosophy, the _spirit_ of the tenets propounded ought to\r\ndecide their relative value. And who will say, that, examined either way,\r\nthis so‐called “Wisdom,” applied solely to the uses and benefit of one\r\nlittle nation, has ever developed in it anything like national ethics. The\r\nProphets are there, to show the walk in life of the chosen but “stiff‐\r\nnecked” people before, during, and after, the days of Moses. That they\r\nhave had at one time the Wisdom‐Religion and the use of its universal\r\nlanguage and symbols is proved by the same Esotericism existing to this\r\nday in India with regard to the “Holy of Holies.” This, as said above, was\r\nand still is the passage through the “Golden” Cow in the same _stooping\r\nposition_ as was necessitated by the Gallery of the Pyramid, which\r\nidentified man with Jehovah in Hebrew Esotericism. The whole difference\r\nlies in the spirit of the interpretation. With the Hindûs as with the\r\nancient Egyptians that spirit was and is entirely metaphysical and\r\npsychological; with the Hebrews it was _realistic_ and _physiological_. It\r\npointed to the first sexual separation of the human race—Eve giving birth\r\nto Cain‐Jehovah, as shown in _The Source of Measures_; to the consummation\r\nof terrestrial physiological union and conception—as in the allegory of\r\nCain shedding Abel’s blood, Habel being the feminine principle; and to\r\nchild‐bearing—a process shown to have begun in the Third Race, or with\r\nAdam’s Third Son, Seth, with whose Son Henoch, men began to call\r\nthemselves Jehovah or Jah‐hovah, the male Jod and Havah or Eve, to wit,\r\nmale and female beings.(1079) Thus the difference lies in the religious\r\nand ethical feeling, but the two symbols are identical. There is no doubt\r\nthat, with the fully initiated Judæan Tanaim, the inner sense of the\r\nsymbolism was as holy in its abstraction as with the ancient Âryan Dvijas.\r\nThe worship of the “God in the Ark” dates only from David; and for a\r\nthousand years Israel knew of no phallic Jehovah. And now the old\r\n_Kabalah_ edited and reëdited, has become tainted with it.\r\n\r\nWith the ancient Âryans the hidden meaning was grandiose, sublime and\r\npoetical, however much the external appearance of their symbol may now\r\nmilitate against the claim. The ceremony of passing through the Holy of\r\nHolies—now symbolized by the Cow, but in the beginning through the temple\r\nHiranya‐garbha, the Radiant Egg, in itself a symbol of Universal, Abstract\r\nNature—meant spiritual conception and birth, or rather the _re‐birth_ of\r\nthe individual and his regeneration; the _stooping_ man at the entrance of\r\nthe Sanctum Sanctorum, ready to pass through the Matrix of Mother Nature,\r\nor the physical creature ready to re‐become the original Spiritual Being,\r\n_pre_‐natal MAN. With the Semite, that _stooping_ man meant the _fall_ of\r\nSpirit into Matter, and that _fall_ and _degradation_ were apotheosized by\r\nhim with the result of dragging Deity down to the level of man. For the\r\nÂryan, the symbol represented the divorce of Spirit from Matter, its\r\nmerging into and return to its primal Source; for the Semite, the wedlock\r\nof Spiritual Man with Material Female Nature, the physiological taking\r\npreëminence over the psychological and the purely immaterial. The Âryan\r\nviews of the symbolism were those of the whole Pagan world; the Semite\r\ninterpretations emanated from, and were preëminently those of a small\r\ntribe, thus marking its national features and the idiosyncratic defects\r\nthat characterize many of the Jews to this day—gross realism, selfishness,\r\nand sensuality. They had made a bargain, through their father Jacob, with\r\ntheir tribal deity, self‐exalted above all others, and a _covenant_ that\r\nhis “seed shall be as the dust of the earth”; and that deity could have no\r\nbetter image henceforth than that of the symbol of generation, and as\r\nrepresentation a _number_ and numbers.\r\n\r\nCarlyle has wise words for both these nations. With the Hindû Âryan—the\r\nmost metaphysical and spiritual people on earth—religion has ever been, in\r\nhis words,\r\n\r\n\r\n    An everlasting lode‐star, that beams the brighter in the heavens\r\n    the darker here on earth grows the night around him.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe religion of the Hindû detaches him from this Earth; therefore, even\r\nnow, the cow‐symbol is one of the grandest and most philosophical among\r\nall others in its inner meaning. To the “Masters” and “Lords” of European\r\npotencies, the Israelites, certain words of Carlyle apply still more\r\nadmirably; for them\r\n\r\n\r\n    Religion is a wise prudential feeling grounded on _mere\r\n    calculation_—\r\n\r\n\r\nand it was so from its beginnings. Having burdened themselves with it,\r\nChristian nations feel bound to defend and _poetize_ it, at the expense of\r\nall other religions.\r\n\r\nBut it was not so with the ancient nations. For them the passage‐entrance\r\nand the sarcophagus in the King’s Chamber meant regeneration—not\r\ngeneration. It was the most solemn symbol, a _Holy of Holies_, indeed,\r\nwherein were created Immortal Hierophants and “Sons of God”—never mortal\r\nmen and sons of lust and flesh, as now in the hidden sense of the Semite\r\nKabalist. The reason for the difference in the views of the two races is\r\neasy to account for. The Âryan Hindû belongs to the oldest races now on\r\nEarth; the Semite Hebrew to the latest. The former is nearly one million\r\nyears old; the latter is a small sub‐race some 8,000 years of age and no\r\nmore.(1080)\r\n\r\nBut phallic worship has developed only with the gradual loss of the keys\r\nto the inner meaning of religious symbols, and there was a day when the\r\nIsraelites had beliefs as pure as the Âryans have. But now Judaism, built\r\n_solely_ on phallic worship, has become one of the latest creeds in Asia,\r\nand theologically a religion of hate and malice toward everyone and\r\neverything outside itself. Philo Judæus shows what was the genuine Hebrew\r\nfaith. The Sacred Writings, he says, prescribe what we ought to do,\r\n_commanding us to hate the heathen and their laws and institutions_. True,\r\nthey did hate Baal or Bacchus worship publicly, but left its worst\r\nfeatures to be followed secretly. It is with the Talmudic Jews that the\r\ngrand symbols of Nature were the most profaned. With them, as now shown by\r\nthe discovery of the key to the correct _Bible_ reading, Geometry, the\r\n_fifth_ Divine Science—“fifth” in the series of the Seven Keys to the\r\nuniversal Esoteric Language and Symbology—was desecrated, and by them\r\napplied to conceal the most terrestrial and grossly sexual mysteries,\r\nwherein both Deity and Religion were degraded.\r\n\r\nWe are told that it is just the same with our Brahmâ‐Prajâpati, with\r\nOsiris and all other _Creative_ Gods. Quite so, when their rites are\r\njudged exoterically and externally; the reverse when their _inner_ meaning\r\nis unveiled, as we see. The Hindû Lingam is identical with Jacob’s\r\n“Pillar”—most undeniably. But the difference, as said, seems to consist in\r\nthe fact that the Esoteric significance of the Lingam was too truly sacred\r\nand metaphysical to be revealed to the profane and the vulgar; hence its\r\nsuperficial appearance was left to the speculations of the mob. Nor would\r\nthe Âryan Hierophant and Brâhman, in their proud exclusiveness and the\r\nsatisfaction of their knowledge, go to the trouble of concealing its\r\nprimeval _nakedness_ under cunningly devised fables; whereas the Rabbi,\r\nhaving interpreted the symbol to suit his own tendencies, had to veil the\r\ncrude significance; and this served a double purpose—that of keeping his\r\nsecret to himself and of exalting himself in his supposed monotheism over\r\nthe Heathen, whom his Law commanded him to hate(1081)—a commandment now\r\ngladly accepted by the Christian too, in spite of another and later\r\ncommandment, “Love one another.” Both India and Egypt had and have their\r\nsacred lotuses, symbolic of the same “Holy of Holies”—the lotus growing in\r\nthe water, a double feminine symbol—the _bearer_ of its own seed and root\r\nof all. Virâj and Horus are both male symbols, emanating from Androgyne\r\nNature, one from Brahmâ and his female counterpart Vâch, the other, from\r\nOsiris and Isis—never from the One Infinite God. In the Judæo‐Christian\r\nsystems it is different. Whereas the lotus, containing Brahmâ, the\r\nUniverse, is shown growing out of Vishnu’s Navel, the Central Point in the\r\nWaters of Infinite Space, and whereas Horus springs from the lotus of the\r\nCelestial Nile—all these abstract pantheistic ideas are dwarfed and made\r\nterrestrially concrete in the _Bible_. One is almost inclined to say that\r\nin the _esoteric_ they are _grosser and still more anthropomorphic_, than\r\nin their _exoteric_ rendering. Take as an example the same symbol, even in\r\nits Christian application—the _lilies_ in the hand of the Archangel\r\nGabriel.(1082) In Hindûism—the “Holy of Holies” is a universal\r\nabstraction, whose _dramatis personæ_ are Infinite Spirit and Nature; in\r\nChristian Judaism, it is a _personal_ God, _outside_ of that Nature, and\r\nthe human womb—Eve, Sarah, etc.; hence, an anthropomorphic phallic God,\r\nand his image—man.\r\n\r\nThus it is maintained, that with regard to the contents of the _Bible_,\r\none of two hypotheses has to be admitted. Either behind the symbolic\r\nsubstitute Jehovah, there was the Unknown, Incognizable Deity, the\r\nkabalistic Ain Suph; or, the Jews have been from the beginning no better\r\nthan the dead‐letter Lingam‐worshippers(1083) of the India of to‐day. We\r\nsay it was the former; and that, therefore, the secret or esoteric worship\r\nof the Jews was the same Pantheism that the Vedântin Philosophers are\r\nreproached with to‐day; Jehovah was a _substitute_ for purposes of an\r\nexoteric national faith, and had no importance or reality in the eyes of\r\nthe erudite Priests and Philosophers—the Sadducees, the most refined and\r\nthe most learned of all the Israelite sects, who stand as a living proof\r\nof it, with their contemptuous rejection of every belief, save the Law.\r\nFor how could those who invented the stupendous scheme now known as the\r\n_Bible_, or their successors who knew, as all Kabalists do, that it was so\r\ninvented for a popular “blind”—how could they, we ask, feel reverence for\r\nsuch a phallic symbol and a _number_, as Jehovah is shown most undeniably\r\nto be in the kabalistic works? How could anyone worthy of the name of a\r\nPhilosopher, and knowing the real _secret_ meaning of their “Pillar of\r\nJacob,” their Bethels, oil‐anointed Phalli, and their “Brazen Serpent,”\r\nworship such a gross symbol, and minister unto it, seeing in it their\r\n“Covenant”—the Lord Himself! Let the reader turn to _Gemara Sanhedrim_ and\r\njudge. As various writers have shown, and as brutally stated in Hargrave\r\nJennings’ _Phallicism_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    _We know from the Jewish records_ that the Ark contained a _table\r\n    of stone_; and if it can be demonstrated that that stone was\r\n    phallic, and yet identical with the sacred name Jehovah or\r\n    Yehovah, which, written in unpointed Hebrew with four letters, is\r\n    J‐E‐V‐E or J‐H‐V‐H (the H being merely an aspirate and the same as\r\n    E). This process leaves us the two letters I and V (or in another\r\n    of its forms U); then if we place the I _in_ the U we have the\r\n    “Holy of Holies”; we also have the Linga and Yoni and Argha of the\r\n    Hindûs, the Iswarra [Îshvara] or “supreme Lord”; and here we have\r\n    the whole secret of its mystic and arc‐celestial import, confirmed\r\n    in itself by being identical with the Linyoni [?] of the Ark of\r\n    the Covenant.(1084)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe biblical Jews of to‐day do not date from Moses but from David—even\r\nadmitting the identity of the old and genuine with the later and\r\nremodelled Mosaic scrolls. Before that time their nationality is lost in\r\nthe mists of pre‐historic darkness, the veil from which is now withdrawn\r\nas much as we have space to do. It is only to the days of the Babylonian\r\ncaptivity that the _Old Testament_ may be referred by the most lenient\r\ncriticism as the approximately correct views that were current about the\r\ndays of Moses. Even such fanatical Christians and worshippers of Jehovah\r\nas the Rev. Mr. Horne, have to admit the numerous changes and alterations\r\nmade by the later compilers of the “Book of God,” since it was _found_ by\r\nHilkiah,(1085) and since\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Pentateuch arose out of the _primitive or older_ documents, by\r\n    means of a _supplementary_ one.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Elohistic texts were re‐written 500 years after the date of Moses; the\r\nJehovistic 800, on the authority of the biblical chronology itself. Hence,\r\nit is maintained that the deity, represented as the organ of generation in\r\nhis pillar‐form, and as a symbol of the double‐sexed organ in the numeral\r\nvalue of the letters of his name—the Yod, י or “phallus,” and Hé, ה, the\r\n“opening,” or the “womb,” according to kabalistic authority—is of a far\r\nlater date than the Elohim‐symbols and is borrowed from the Pagan\r\n_exoteric_ rites; and Jehovah is thus on a par with the Lingam and Yoni\r\nfound on every roadside in India.\r\n\r\nJust as the Iao of the Mysteries was distinct from Jehovah, so was the\r\nlater Iao and Abraxas, or Abrasax, of some Gnostic sects identical with\r\nthe God of the Hebrews, who was the same as the Egyptian Horus. This is\r\nundeniably proven on “Heathen” as on the Gnostic “Christian” gems. In\r\nMatter’s collection of such gems there is a “Horus”—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Seated on the lotus, inscribed ΑΒΡΑΣΑΞ ΙΑΩ (Abrasax Iao)—an\r\n    address exactly parallel to the so frequent ΕΙΣ ΖΕΥΣ ΣΑΡΑΠΙ (Eis\r\n    Zeus Sarapi) on the contemporary Heathen gems, and therefore only\r\n    to be translated by “Abraxas is the One Jehovah.”(1086)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut who was Abraxas? As the same author shows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The numerical or Kabbalistic value of the name Abraxas directly\r\n    refers to the Persian title of the god “Mithras,” Ruler of the\r\n    year, worshipped from the earliest times under the appellation of\r\n    Iao.(1087)\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, he was the Sun, in one aspect, the Moon or the Lunar Genius, in\r\nanother, that Generative Deity whom the Gnostics saluted as “Thou that\r\npresidest over the Mysteries of the Father and the Son, who shinest in the\r\nnight‐time, holding _the second rank_, the first Lord of Death.”\r\n\r\nIt is only in his capacity of the Genius of the Moon—the latter being\r\ncredited in the old cosmogony with being the parent of our Earth—that\r\nJehovah could ever be regarded as the _Creator_ of our Globe and _its_\r\nHeaven, namely, the Firmament.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of all this will be no proof, however, to the average bigot.\r\nMissionaries will go on with the most virulent attacks on the religions of\r\nIndia, and Christians read with the same benighted smile of satisfaction\r\nas ever these preposterously unjust words of Coleridge:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is highly worthy of observation that the inspired writings\r\n    received by Christians are distinguishable from all other books\r\n    _pretending to inspiration_, from the Scriptures of the Brahmins,\r\n    and even from the Koran, in their strong and frequent\r\n    _recommendation of truth_ [!!].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection IV. On the Myth of the “Fallen Angels” in its Various Aspects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. The Evil Spirit: Who, And What?\r\n\r\n\r\nOur present quarrel is exclusively with Theology. The Church enforces\r\nbelief in a Personal God and a Personal Devil, while Occultism shows the\r\nfallacy of such a belief. For the Pantheists and Occultists, as much as\r\nfor the Pessimists, “Nature” is no better than “a comely mother, but stone\r\ncold”; but this is true only so far as regards _external_ Physical Nature.\r\nThey both agree that, to the superficial observer, she is no better than\r\nan immense slaughter‐house wherein butchers become victims, and victims\r\nexecutioners in their turn. It is quite natural that the pessimistically\r\ninclined profane, once convinced of Nature’s numerous shortcomings and\r\nfailures, and especially of her autophagous propensities, should imagine\r\nthis to be the best evidence that there is no Deity _in abscondito_ within\r\nNature, nor anything divine in her. Nor is it less natural that the\r\nMaterialist and the Physicist should imagine that everything is due to\r\nblind force and chance, and to the survival of the _strongest_, even more\r\noften than of the _fittest_. But the Occultists, who regard Physical\r\nNature as a bundle of most varied illusions on the plane of deceptive\r\nperceptions; who recognize in every pain and suffering but the necessary\r\npangs of incessant procreation; a series of stages toward an ever‐growing\r\nperfectibility, which is visible in the silent influence of never‐erring\r\nKarma, or _Abstract_ Nature—the Occultists, we say, view the Great Mother\r\notherwise. Woe to those who live without suffering. Stagnation and death\r\nis the future of all that vegetates without change. And how can there be\r\nany change for the better without proportionate suffering during the\r\npreceding stage? Is it not those only who have learnt the deceptive value\r\nof earthly hopes and the illusive allurements of external nature who are\r\ndestined to solve the great problems of life, pain, and death?\r\n\r\nIf our modern Philosophers—preceded by the mediæval scholars—have helped\r\nthemselves to more than one fundamental idea of antiquity, Theologians\r\nhave built their God and his Archangels, their Satan and his Angels, along\r\nwith the Logos and his staff, entirely out of the _dramatis personæ_ of\r\nthe old heathen Pantheons. They would have been welcome to these, had they\r\nnot cunningly distorted the original characters, perverted the\r\nphilosophical meaning, and, taking advantage of the ignorance of\r\nChristendom—the result of long ages of mental sleep, during which humanity\r\nwas permitted to think only by proxy—tossed every symbol into the most\r\ninextricable confusion. One of their most sinful achievements in this\r\ndirection, was the transformation of the divine _Alter Ego_ into the\r\ngrotesque Satan of their Theology.\r\n\r\nAs the whole philosophy of the problem of evil hangs upon the correct\r\ncomprehension of the constitution of the _Inner_ Being of Nature and Man,\r\nof the divine within the animal, and hence also the correctness of the\r\nwhole system as given in these pages, with regard to the crown piece of\r\nevolution—Man—we cannot take sufficient precautions against theological\r\nsubterfuges. When the good St. Augustine and the fiery Tertullian call the\r\nDevil the “monkey of God,” we can attribute it to the ignorance of the age\r\nthey lived in. It is more difficult to excuse our modern writers on the\r\nsame ground. The translation of Mazdean literature has afforded Roman\r\nCatholic writers the pretext for proving their point in the same direction\r\nonce more. They have taken advantage of the dual nature of Ahura Mazda and\r\nof his Amshaspands in the _Zend Avesta_ and the _Vendîdâd_, to emphasize\r\nstill further their wild theories. Satan is the _plagiarist and the\r\ncopyist by anticipation_ of the religion which came ages later. This was\r\none of the master strokes of the Latin Church, its best trump‐card after\r\nthe appearance of Spiritualism in Europe. Though only a _succès d’estime_,\r\nin general, even among those who are not interested in either Theosophy or\r\nSpiritualism, yet the weapon is often used by the Christian (Roman\r\nCatholic) Kabalists against the Eastern Occultists.\r\n\r\nNow even the Materialists are quite harmless, and may be regarded as the\r\nfriends of Theosophy, when compared to some fanatical “Christian”—as they\r\ncall themselves, “Sectarian” as we call them—Kabalists, on the Continent.\r\nThese read the _Zohar_, not to find in it ancient Wisdom, but, by mangling\r\nthe texts and meaning, to discover in its verses Christian dogmas, where\r\nnone could ever have been meant; and, having fished them out with the\r\ncollective help of Jesuitical casuistry and learning, the supposed\r\n“Kabalists” proceed to write books and to mislead less far‐sighted\r\nstudents of the Kabalah.(1088)\r\n\r\nMay we not then be permitted to drag the deep rivers of the Past, and thus\r\nbring to the surface the root idea that led to the transformation of the\r\nWisdom‐God, who had first been regarded as the Creator of everything that\r\nexists, into an Angel of Evil—a ridiculous horned biped, half goat and\r\nhalf monkey, with hoofs and a tail? We need not go out of the way to\r\ncompare the Pagan Demons of either Egypt, India, or Chaldæa with the Devil\r\nof Christianity, for no such comparison is possible. But we may stop to\r\nglance at the biography of the Christian Devil, a piratical reprint from\r\nthe Chaldæo‐Judæan mythology.\r\n\r\nThe primitive origin of this personification rests upon the Akkadian\r\nconception of the Cosmic Powers—the Heavens and the Earth—in eternal feud\r\nand struggle with Chaos. Their Silik‐Muludag (? Murudug), “the God amongst\r\nall the Gods,” the “merciful guardian of men on Earth,” was the son of Hea\r\n(or Ea) the great God of Wisdom, called by the Babylonians Nebo. With both\r\npeoples, as also in the case of the Hindû Gods, their deities were both\r\nbeneficent and maleficent. As evil and punishment are the agents of Karma,\r\nin an absolutely just retributive sense, so Evil was the servant of the\r\nGood.(1089) The reading of the Chaldæo‐Assyrian tiles has now demonstrated\r\nthis beyond a shadow of doubt. We find the same idea in the _Zohar_. Satan\r\nwas a Son and an Angel of God. With all the Semitic nations, the Spirit of\r\nthe Earth was as much the Creator in his own realm as the Spirit of the\r\nHeavens. They were twin brothers and interchangeable in their functions,\r\nwhen not two in one. Nothing of that which we find in _Genesis_ is absent\r\nfrom the Chaldæo‐Assyrian religious beliefs, even in the little that has\r\nhitherto been deciphered. The great “Face of the Deep” of _Genesis_ is\r\ntraced in the Tohu Bohu (“Deep” or “Primeval Space”), or Chaos, of the\r\nBabylonians. Wisdom, the Great Unseen God—called in _Genesis_ the “Spirit\r\nof God”—lived, for the older Babylonians as for the Akkadians, in the Sea\r\nof Space. Toward the days described by Berosus, this Sea became the\r\nVisible Waters on the face of the Earth—the crystalline abode of the Great\r\nMother, the Mother of Ea and all the Gods, which became, still later, the\r\ngreat Dragon Tiamat, the Sea Serpent. Its last stage of development was\r\nthe great struggle of Bel with the Dragon—the Devil!\r\n\r\nWhence the Christian idea that God cursed the Devil? The God of the Jews,\r\nwhosoever he was, forbids cursing Satan. Philo Judæus and Josephus both\r\nstate that the Law (the _Pentateuch_ and the _Talmud_) undeviatingly\r\nforbid one to curse the Adversary, and also the Gods of the Gentiles.\r\n“Thou shalt not revile the Gods,” quoth the God of Moses,(1090) for it is\r\nGod who “hath divided [them] unto all nations”;(1091) and those who speak\r\nevil of “Dignities” (Gods) are called “filthy dreamers” by Jude.\r\n\r\n\r\n    For even Michael the Archangel ... durst not bring against him\r\n    [the Devil] a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke\r\n    thee.(1092)\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally the same is repeated in the _Talmud_:(1093)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Satan appeared one day to a man who used to curse him daily, and\r\n    said to him: “Why dost thou this?” Consider that _God himself_\r\n    would not curse me, but merely said: “The Lord rebuke thee,\r\n    Satan.”(1094)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis piece of Talmudic information shows plainly (_a_) that St. Michael is\r\ncalled “God” in the _Talmud_, and somebody else the “Lord,” and (_b_) that\r\nSatan is _a_ God, of whom even the “Lord” is in fear. All we read in the\r\n_Zohar_ and other kabalistic works on Satan shows plainly that this\r\n“personage” is simply the personification of the abstract Evil, which is\r\nthe weapon of Karmic Law and Karma. It is our human nature and man\r\nhimself, as it is said that “Satan is always near and inextricably\r\ninterwoven with man.” It is only a question of that Power being latent or\r\nactive in us.\r\n\r\nIt is a well‐known fact—to learned Symbologists at all events—that in\r\nevery great religion of antiquity, it is the Logos Demiurge—the Second\r\nLogos, or the first emanation from the Mind, Mahat—who is made to strike,\r\nso to say, the key‐note of that which may be called the correlation of\r\nIndividuality and Personality in the subsequent scheme of evolution. It is\r\nthe Logos who is shown, in the mystic symbolism of Cosmogony, Theogony,\r\nand Anthropogony, playing two parts in the drama of Creation and\r\nBeing—that of the purely human Personality and the divine Impersonality of\r\nthe so‐called Avatâras, or divine Incarnations, and of the Universal\r\nSpirit, called Christos by the Gnostics, and the Fravarshi (or Ferouer) of\r\nAhura Mazda in the Mazdean Philosophy. On the lower rungs of Theogony the\r\nCelestial Beings of lower Hierarchies had each a Fravarshi, or a Celestial\r\n“Double.” It is the same, only still more mystic, reässertion of the\r\nkabalistic axiom, “_Deus est Demon inversus_”; the word “Demon,” however,\r\nas in the case of Socrates, and in the spirit of the meaning given to it\r\nby the whole of antiquity, standing for the Guardian Spirit, an “Angel,”\r\nnot a Devil of Satanic descent as Theology would have it. The Roman\r\nCatholic Church shows its usual logic and consistency by accepting St.\r\nMichael as the Ferouer of Christ. This Ferouer was his “Angel Guardian,”\r\nas _proved_ by St. Thomas,(1095) who, however, calls the prototypes and\r\nsynonyms of Michael, such as Mercury for example, Devils!\r\n\r\nThe Church positively accepts the tenet that Christ has his Ferouer as any\r\nother God or mortal has. Writes De Mirville:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Here we have the two heroes of the Old Testament, the _Verbum_ [?]\r\n    (or _second_ Jehovah), and his _Face_ [“Presence,” as the\r\n    Protestants translate], both making but one, and yet being two, a\r\n    mystery which seemed to us unsolvable before we had studied the\r\n    doctrine of the Mazdean _Ferouers_, and learnt that the _Ferouer_\r\n    was the spiritual potency, at once _image_, _face_, and _guardian_\r\n    of the Soul which finally assimilates the _Ferouer_.(1096)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is _almost_ correct.\r\n\r\nAmong other absurdities, the Kabalists maintain that the word Metatron,\r\nbeing divided into _meta‐thronon_ (μετὰ, θρόνον), means “near the\r\nthrone.”(1097) It means quite the reverse, as _meta_ means “beyond” and\r\nnot “near.” This is of great importance in our argument. St. Michael,\r\nthen, the “_quis ut Deus_,” is the translator, so to speak, of the\r\ninvisible world into the visible and the objective.\r\n\r\nThey maintain, furthermore, along with the Roman Catholic Church, that in\r\nthe Biblical and Christian Theology there does not exist a “higher\r\ncelestial personality, after the Trinity, than that of the Archangel, or\r\nthe Seraphim, Michael.” According to them, the conqueror of the Dragon is\r\nthe Archisatrap of the Sacred Militia, the Guardian of the Planets, the\r\nKing of the Stars, the Slayer of Satan and the Powerful Rector. In the\r\nmystic Astronomy of these gentlemen, he is the Conqueror of Ahriman, who\r\nhaving upset the Sidereal Throne of the usurper, bathes in his stead in\r\nthe Solar Fires; and, Defender of the Christ‐Sun, he approaches so near\r\nhis Master, “that he seems to become one with him.”(1098) Owing to this\r\nfusion with the Word (Verbum) the Protestants, and among them Calvin,\r\nended by losing sight entirely of the duality, and saw no Michael “but\r\nonly his Master,” writes the Abbé Caron. The Roman Catholics, and\r\nespecially their Kabalists, know better; and it is they who explain to the\r\nworld this duality, which affords them the means of glorifying the chosen\r\nones of the Church, and of rejecting and anathematizing all those Gods who\r\nmay be in the way of their dogmas.\r\n\r\nThus the same titles and the same names are given in turn to God and the\r\nArchangel. Both are called Metatron, “both have the name of Jehovah\r\napplied to them when they speak _one in the other_” (_sic_), for,\r\naccording to the _Zohar_, the term signifies equally the Master and the\r\nAmbassador. Both are the Angel of the Face, because, as we are informed,\r\nif on the one hand the “Word” is called “the Face [or the Presence] and\r\nthe Image of the Substance of God,” on the other, “when speaking of the\r\n_Saviour_ to the Israelites, Isaiah [?] tells them” that “the Angel of his\r\nPresence saved them in their affliction”—“so he was their Saviour.”(1099)\r\nElsewhere Michael is called very plainly the “Prince of the Faces of the\r\nLord,” the “Glory of the Lord.” Both Jehovah and Michael are the “Guides\r\nof Israel(1100) ... Chiefs of the Armies of the Lord, Supreme Judges of\r\nthe Souls and even Seraphs.”(1101)\r\n\r\nThe whole of the above is given on the authority of various works by Roman\r\nCatholics, and must, therefore, be orthodox. Some expressions are\r\ntranslated to show what subtle Theologians and Casuists mean by the term\r\nFerouer,(1102) a word borrowed by some French writers from the _Zend\r\nAvesta_, as said, and utilized in Roman Catholicism for a purpose\r\nZoroaster was very far from anticipating. In Fargard xix (verse 14), of\r\nthe _Vendîdâd_ it is said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Invoke, O Zarathushtra! my Fravarshi, who am Ahura Mazda, the\r\n    greatest, the best, the fairest of all beings, the most solid, the\r\n    most intelligent, ... and whose soul is the holy Word (Mâthra\r\n    Spenta).(1103)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe French Orientalists translate _Fravarshi_ by _Ferouer_.\r\n\r\nNow what is a Ferouer, or Fravarshi? In some Mazdean works it is plainly\r\nimplied that Fravarshi is the _inner_, immortal Man, or the Ego which\r\nreïncarnates; that it existed before the physical body and survives all\r\nsuch bodies it happens to be clothed in.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Not only man was endowed with a Fravarshi, _but gods too_, and the\r\n    sky, fire, waters, and plants.(1104)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis shows as plainly as can be shown that the Ferouer is the “spiritual\r\ncounterpart” of either God, animal, plant, or even element, _i.e._, the\r\nrefined and the _purer_ part of the grosser creation, the soul of the\r\nbody, whatever the body may happen to be. Therefore does Ahura Mazda\r\nrecommend Zarathushtra to invoke his Fravarshi and not himself (Ahura\r\nMazda); that is to say, the impersonal and _true_ Essence of Deity, one\r\nwith Zoroaster’s own Âtmâ (or Christos), not the _false_ and personal\r\nappearance. This is quite clear.\r\n\r\nNow it is on this divine and ethereal prototype that the Roman Catholics\r\nhave seized so as to build up the supposed difference between their God\r\nand Angels and the Deity and its aspects, or the Gods of the old\r\nreligions. Thus, while calling Mercury, Venus, Jupiter (whether as Gods or\r\nPlanets) Devils, they at the same time make of the same Mercury the\r\nFerouer of their Christ. This fact is undeniable. Vossius(1105) proves\r\nthat Michael is the Mercury of the Pagans, and Maury and other French\r\nwriters corroborate him, and add that according to great Theologians\r\n_Mercury and the Sun are one_, (?) and no wonder, they think, since\r\nMercury being so near the Wisdom and the Verbum (the Sun), must be\r\nabsorbed by and confounded with him.(1106)\r\n\r\nThis “Pagan” view was accepted from the first century of our era, as shown\r\nin the original _Acts of the Apostles_ (the English translation being\r\nworthless). So much is Michael the Mercury of the Greeks and other\r\nnations, that when the inhabitants of Lystra mistook Paul and Barnabas for\r\nMercury and Jupiter, saying, “The Gods have come down to us in the\r\nlikeness of men”—the text adds: “And they called Barnabas Zeus, and Paul,\r\nHermes, because he was the _leader of the Word_ (Logos),” and not “the\r\nchief speaker,” as erroneously translated in the Authorized, and repeated\r\neven in the Revised, English _Bible_. Michael is the Angel of the vision\r\nin _Daniel_, the Son of God, “who was like unto a Son of Man.” It is the\r\nHermes‐Christos of the Gnostics, the Anubis‐Syrius of the Egyptians, the\r\nCounsellor of Osiris in Amenti, the Leontoid Michael‐Ophiomorphos\r\n(ὀφιομόρφος) of the Ophites, who wears on certain Gnostic jewels a lion’s\r\n_head_, like his father Ildabaoth.(1107)\r\n\r\nNow to all this the Roman Catholic Church tacitly consents, many of her\r\nwriters even avowing it publicly. Unable to deny the flagrant “borrowing”\r\nof their Church, who “spoiled” her seniors of their symbols, as the Jews\r\nhad “spoiled” the Egyptians of their jewels of silver and gold, they\r\nexplain the fact quite coolly and seriously. Thus the writers who have\r\nhitherto been _timid_ enough to see, in this repetition by Christian\r\ndogmas of old Pagan ideas, “a _legendary plagiarism_ perpetrated by man,”\r\nare gravely assured that, far from such a simple solution of the almost\r\nperfect resemblance, it has to be attributed to quite another cause—“to a\r\n_pre‐historical_ plagiarism, of a _superhuman_ origin.”\r\n\r\nIf the reader would know how, he must again kindly turn to the same volume\r\nof De Mirville’s work.(1108) Please note that this author was the\r\n_official and recognized defender_ of the Roman Church, and was helped by\r\nthe learning of all the Jesuits. There we read:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We have pointed out several demi‐gods, and also “very historical”\r\n    heroes of the Pagans, who were predestined from the moment of\r\n    their birth, _to ape_, while at the same time they dishonoured,\r\n    the nativity of the hero, _who was quite God_, before whom the\r\n    whole earth had to bow; we have traced them being born as _he_\r\n    was, from an immaculate mother; we have seen them strangling\r\n    serpents in their cradles, fighting against demons, performing\r\n    miracles, dying as martyrs, descending to the nether world and\r\n    rising again from the dead. And we have bitterly deplored that\r\n    timid and shy Christians should feel compelled to explain all such\r\n    identities on the ground of coincidence of myth and symbol. They\r\n    forget apparently these words of the Saviour, _all that came\r\n    before me are thieves and robbers_—a word which explains all\r\n    without any absurd negation and which I have commented on in these\r\n    words, “The Evangel is a sublime drama, _parodied and played\r\n    before its appointed time by ruffians_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “ruffians” (_les drôles_), are of course Demons whose manager is\r\nSatan. Now this is the easiest and the most sublime and simple way of\r\ngetting out of the difficulty! The Rev. Dr. Lundy, a Protestant De\r\nMirville, followed the happy suggestion in his _Monumental Christianity_,\r\nand so did Dr. Sepp of Munich in his works written to prove the divinity\r\nof Jesus and the Satanic origin of all other Saviours. So much greater the\r\npity that a systematic and collective plagiarism which went on for several\r\ncenturies on the most gigantic scale, should be explained by another\r\nplagiarism, this time in the fourth Gospel. For the sentence quoted from\r\nit, “All that ever came before me,” etc., is a _verbatim_ repetition of\r\nwords written in the _Book of Enoch_. In the Introduction to Archbishop\r\nLaurence’s translation from an Ethiopic MS. in the Bodleian Library, the\r\neditor, author of the _Evolution of Christianity_, remarks:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In revising the proof‐sheets of the Book of Enoch, we have been\r\n    still further impressed by relationship with New Testament\r\n    Scripture. Thus, the parable of the sheep, rescued by the good\r\n    Shepherd from hireling guardians and ferocious wolves, is\r\n    _obviously borrowed_ by the fourth Evangelist from Enoch lxxxix,\r\n    in which the author depicts the shepherds as killing and\r\n    destroying the sheep before the advent of their Lord, and thus\r\n    discloses the true meaning of that hitherto mysterious passage in\r\n    the Johannine parable—“All that ever came before me are thieves\r\n    and robbers”—language in which we now detect an obvious reference\r\n    to the allegorical shepherds of Enoch.(1109)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is too late in the day to claim that it is Enoch who borrowed from the\r\n_New Testament_, instead of _vice versâ_. Jude (14, 15) quotes _verbatim_\r\nfrom Enoch a long passage about the coming of the Lord with his ten\r\nthousand saints, and naming the prophet specifically _acknowledges_ the\r\nsource.\r\n\r\n\r\n    In ... perfecting the parallelism between prophet and apostle,\r\n    [we] have placed beyond controversy that, _in the eyes of the\r\n    author of an Epistle accepted as Divine revelation_, the Book of\r\n    Enoch _was the inspired production of an antediluvian\r\n    patriarch_....\r\n\r\n    The cumulative coincidence of language and ideas in Enoch and the\r\n    authors of New Testament Scripture, ... clearly indicates that the\r\n    work of the Semitic Milton was the inexhaustible source from which\r\n    Evangelists and Apostles, or the men who wrote in their names,\r\n    borrowed their conceptions of the resurrection, judgment,\r\n    immortality, perdition, and of the universal reign of\r\n    righteousness under the eternal dominion of the Son of Man. This\r\n    _evangelical plagiarism_ culminates in the Revelation of John,\r\n    which adapts the visions of Enoch to Christianity, with\r\n    modifications in which we miss the sublime simplicity of the great\r\n    master of apocalyptic prediction, who prophesied in the name of\r\n    the antediluvian Patriarch.(1110)\r\n\r\n\r\n“Antediluvian,” truly; but if the phraseology of the text dates hardly a\r\nfew centuries or even millenniums before the historical era, then it is no\r\nlonger the original _prediction_ of the events to come, but is, in its\r\nturn, a copy of some scripture of a pre‐historic religion.\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the Krita age, Vishnu, in the form of Kapila and other\r\n    (inspired teachers) ... imparts ... true wisdom [as Enoch did]. In\r\n    the Tretâ age he restrains the wicked, in the form of a universal\r\n    monarch [Chakravartin, the “Everlasting King” of Enoch(1111)] and\r\n    protects the three worlds [or Races]. In the Dvâpara age, in the\r\n    person of Veda‐vyâsa, he divides the one Veda into four, and\r\n    distributes it into hundreds (Shata) of branches.(1112)\r\n\r\n\r\nTruly so; the Veda of the earliest Âryans, before it was written, went\r\nforth into every nation of the Atlanto‐Lemurians, and sowed the first\r\nseeds of all the now existing old religions. The off‐shoots of the never\r\ndying Tree of Wisdom have scattered their dead leaves even on Judæo‐\r\nChristianity. And at the end of the Kali, our present Age, Vishnu, or the\r\n“Everlasting King,” will appear as Kalki, and reëstablish righteousness\r\nupon earth. The minds of those who live at that time shall be awakened,\r\nand become as pellucid as crystal.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The men who are thus changed by virtue of that peculiar time [the\r\n    Sixth Race] _shall be as the seeds_ of other human beings, and\r\n    shall give birth to a race who shall follow the laws of the Krita\r\n    age of purity;\r\n\r\n\r\n_i.e._, it shall be the Seventh Race, the Race of “Buddhas,” the “Sons of\r\nGod,” born of _immaculate_ parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB. The Gods Of Light Proceed From The Gods Of Darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus it is pretty well established that Christ, the Logos, or the God in\r\nSpace and the Saviour on Earth, is but one of the echoes of this same\r\nantediluvian and sorely misunderstood Wisdom. Its history begins by the\r\ndescent on Earth of the “Gods” who incarnate in mankind, and this is the\r\n“Fall.” Whether Brahmâ hurled down on Earth by Bhagavân in the allegory,\r\nor Jupiter by Cronus, all are the symbols of the human races. Once having\r\ntouched this Planet of dense Matter, the snow‐white wings of even the\r\nhighest Angel can no longer remain immaculate, or the Avatâra (or\r\nincarnation) be perfect, as every such Avatâra is the fall of a God into\r\ngeneration. Nowhere is the metaphysical truth more clear, when explained\r\nEsoterically, or more hidden from the average comprehension of those who\r\ninstead of appreciating the sublimity of the idea can only degrade it—than\r\nin the _Upanishads_, the Esoteric glossaries of the _Vedas_. The _Rig\r\nVeda_, as Guignault characterized it, “is the most sublime conception of\r\nthe great highways of humanity.” The _Vedas_ are, and will remain for\r\never, in the Esotericism of the _Vedânta_ and the _Upanishads_, “the\r\nmirror of the Eternal Wisdom.”\r\n\r\nFor upwards of sixteen centuries the new masks, forced over the faces of\r\nthe old Gods, have screened them from public curiosity, but they have\r\nfinally proved a misfit. Yet the metaphorical Fall, and the as\r\nmetaphorical Atonement and Crucifixion, have led Western Humanity through\r\nroads knee‐deep in blood. Worse than all, they have led it to believe in\r\nthe dogma of the Evil Spirit distinct from the Spirit of all Good, whereas\r\nthe former lives in all Matter and preëminently in man. Finally it has\r\ncreated the God‐slandering dogma of Hell and eternal perdition; it has\r\nspread a thick film between the higher intuitions of man and divine\r\nverities; and, most pernicious result of all, it has made people remain\r\nignorant of the fact that there were no fiends, no dark demons in the\r\nUniverse before man’s own appearance on this, and probably on other\r\nEarths. Hence the people have been led to accept, as the problematical\r\nconsolation for this world’s sorrows, the thought of original sin.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy of that Law in Nature, which implants in man as well as in\r\nevery beast a passionate, inherent, and instinctive desire for freedom and\r\nself‐guidance, pertains to Psychology and cannot be touched on now, for to\r\ndemonstrate this feeling in higher Intelligences, to analyze and give a\r\nnatural reason for it, would necessitate an endless philosophical\r\nexplanation for which there here is no room. Perhaps the best synthesis of\r\nthis feeling is found in three lines of Milton’s _Paradise Lost_. Says the\r\n“Fallen One”:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Here we may reign secure; and in my choice,\r\n    To reign is worth ambition, though in hell!\r\n    Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven!\r\n\r\n\r\nBetter be man, the crown of terrestrial production and king over its _opus\r\noperatum_, than be lost among the will‐less Spiritual Hosts in Heaven.\r\n\r\nWe have said elsewhere that the dogma of the first Fall rested on a few\r\nverses in _Revelation_, which are now shown to be a plagiarism from Enoch\r\nby some scholars. These have given rise to endless theories and\r\nspeculations, which have gradually acquired the importance of dogma and\r\ninspired tradition. Every one sought to explain the verse about the seven‐\r\nheaded dragon with his ten horns and seven crowns, whose tail “drew the\r\nthird part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth,” and\r\nwhose place, with that of his Angels, “was found no more in heaven.” What\r\nthe seven heads of the Dragon (or Cycle) mean, and its _five_ wicked kings\r\nalso, may be learned in the Addenda which close Part III of this Volume.\r\n\r\nFrom Newton to Bossuet speculations were incessantly evolved in Christian\r\nbrains with regard to these obscure verses. Says Bossuet:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The star that falls is the heresiarch Theodosius.... The clouds of\r\n    smoke are the heresies of the Montanists.... The third part of the\r\n    stars are the martyrs, and especially the doctors of divinity.\r\n\r\n\r\nBossuet ought to have known, however, that the events described in\r\n_Revelation_ were not original, and may, as shown, be found in other and\r\nPagan traditions. There were no scholastics nor Montanists during Vedic\r\ntimes, nor yet far earlier in China. But Christian _Theology_ had to be\r\n_protected and saved_.\r\n\r\nThis is only natural. But why should truth be sacrificed in order to\r\nprotect from destruction the lucubrations of Christian Theologians?\r\n\r\nThe “_princeps aeris hujus_,” the “Prince of the Air,” of St. Paul, is not\r\nthe Devil, but the effects of the Astral Light, as Éliphas Lévi correctly\r\nexplains. The Devil is not the “God _of this period_,” as he says, for it\r\nis the Deity of every age and period since Man appeared on Earth, and\r\nMatter in its countless forms and states had to fight for its evanescent\r\nexistence against other disintegrating Forces.\r\n\r\nThe “Dragon” is simply the symbol of the Cycle and of the “Sons of\r\nManvantaric Eternity,” who had descended on Earth during a certain epoch\r\nof its formative period. The “clouds of smoke” are geological phenomena.\r\nThe “third part of the stars of heaven,” cast down to the Earth, refers to\r\nthe Divine Monads—the Spirits of the Stars in Astrology—that\r\ncircumambulate our Globe; _i.e._, the _human_ Egos destined to perform the\r\nwhole Cycle of Incarnations. The sentence, “_qui circumambulat terram_,”\r\nhowever, is again referred to the Devil in Theology, the mythical Father\r\nof Evil being said to “fall like lightning.” Unfortunately for this\r\ninterpretation, the “Son of Man,” or Christ, is expected, on the personal\r\ntestimony of Jesus, to descend on Earth likewise, “as the lightning cometh\r\nout of the East,”(1113) just in the same shape and under the same symbol\r\nas Satan, who is seen to fall “as lightning ... from heaven.”(1114) All\r\nthese metaphors and figures of speech, preëminently Oriental in their\r\ncharacter, must have their origin searched for in the East. In all the\r\nancient Cosmogonies _Light_ comes from _Darkness_. In Egypt, as elsewhere,\r\n_Darkness_ was “the principle of all things.” Hence Pymander, the “Thought\r\nDivine,” issues as Light from Darkness. Behemoth(1115) is the principle of\r\nDarkness, or Satan, in Roman Catholic Theology, and yet Job says of him\r\nthat Behemoth is “the chief [principle] of the ways of God”—“_Principium\r\nviarum Domini Behemoth!_”(1116)\r\n\r\nConsistency does not seem to be a favourite virtue in any portion of\r\nDivine Revelation, so‐called—not as interpreted by Theologians, at any\r\nrate.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians and the Chaldæans referred the birth of their Divine\r\nDynasties to that period when creative Earth was in her last final throes\r\nin giving birth to her pre‐historic mountain ranges, which have since\r\ndisappeared, her seas and her continents. Her face was covered with “deep\r\nDarkness and in that [Secondary] Chaos was the principle of all things”\r\nthat developed on the Globe later on. Our Geologists have now ascertained\r\nthat there was such a terrestrial conflagration in the early geological\r\nperiods, several hundred millions of years ago.(1117) As to the tradition\r\nitself, every country and nation had it, each under its respective\r\nnational form.\r\n\r\nIt is not alone Egypt, Greece, Scandinavia or Mexico, that had its Typhon,\r\nPython, Loki, and its “falling” Demon, but China also. The Celestials have\r\na whole literature upon the subject. It is said that in consequence of the\r\nrebellion against Ti of a proud Spirit, who said he was Ti himself, seven\r\nChoirs of Celestial Spirits were exiled upon Earth, which “_brought a\r\nchange in all Nature_, Heaven itself _bending_ down and uniting with\r\nEarth.”\r\n\r\nIn the _Y‐King_, one reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The flying Dragon, superb and rebellious, suffers now, and his\r\n    pride is punished; he thought he would reign in Heaven, he reigns\r\n    only on the Earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, the _Tchoon‐Tsieoo_ says allegorically:\r\n\r\n\r\n    One night the stars ceased shining in darkness, and deserted it,\r\n    falling down like rain upon the Earth, _where they are now\r\n    hidden_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese stars are the Monads.\r\n\r\nChinese Cosmogonies have their “Lord of the Flame” and their “Celestial\r\nVirgin,” with little “Spirits to help and minister to her; and big Spirits\r\nto fight those who are the enemies of other Gods.” But all this does not\r\nprove that the said allegories are _presentments_ or _prophetic_ writings\r\nwhich all refer to Christian Theology.\r\n\r\nThe best proof one can offer to Christian Theologians that the Esoteric\r\nstatements in the _Bible_—in both Testaments—are the assertion of the same\r\nidea as in our Archaic Teachings, to wit, that the “Fall of the Angels”\r\nreferred simply to the Incarnation of Angels “who had broken through the\r\nSeven Circles”—is found in the _Zohar_. Now the _Kabalah_ of Simeon Ben\r\nIochaï is the soul and essence of the allegorical narrative, as the later\r\n_Christian Kabalah_ is the “dark cloaked” Mosaic Pentateuch. And it says\r\n(in the Agrippa MSS.):\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Wisdom of the Kabalah rests in the Science of the Equilibrium\r\n    and Harmony.\r\n\r\n    Forces that manifest without having been first equilibrized perish\r\n    in Space [“equilibrized” meaning differentiated].\r\n\r\n    Thus perished the first Kings [the Divine Dynasties] of the\r\n    Ancient World, the _self‐produced_ Princes of Giants. They fell\r\n    like rootless trees, and were seen no more; for _they were the\r\n    Shadow of the Shadow_ [to wit, the Chhâyâ of the Shadowy\r\n    Pitris].(1118)\r\n\r\n    But those that came after them, who shooting down like falling\r\n    stars were enshrined in the Shadows—prevailed to this day\r\n    [Dhyânîs, who by incarnating in those “empty Shadows,” inaugurated\r\n    the era of mankind].\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery sentence in the ancient Cosmogonies unfolds to him who can read\r\nbetween the lines the identity of the ideas, though under different garbs.\r\n\r\nThe first lesson taught in Esoteric Philosophy is, that the Incognizable\r\nCause does not put forth evolution, whether consciously or unconsciously,\r\nbut only exhibits periodically _different aspects_ of Itself to the\r\nperception of _finite_ minds. Now the Collective Mind—the\r\nUniversal—composed of various and numberless Hosts of Creative Powers,\r\nhowever infinite in Manifested Time, is still finite when contrasted with\r\nthe Unborn and Undecaying Space in its supreme essential aspect. That\r\nwhich is finite cannot be perfect. Therefore there are inferior Beings\r\namong those Hosts, but there never have been any Devils or “disobedient\r\nAngels,” for the simple reason that they are all governed by Law. The\r\nAsuras (call them by any other name you will) who incarnated, followed in\r\nthis a law as implacable as any other. They had manifested prior to the\r\nPitris, and as Time (in Space) proceeds in Cycles, their turn had\r\ncome—hence the numerous allegories. The name “Asura” was first given by\r\nthe Brâhmans indiscriminately to those who opposed their mummeries and\r\nsacrifices, as did the great Asura called Asurendra. It is to those ages,\r\nprobably, that the origin of the idea of the Demon, as opposer and\r\nadversary, has to be traced.\r\n\r\nThe Hebrew Elohim, called “God” in the translations, who create “Light,”\r\nare identical with the Âryan Asuras. They are also referred to as the\r\n“Sons of Darkness,” as a philosophical and logical contrast to Light\r\nImmutable and Eternal. The earliest Zoroastrians did not believe in Evil\r\nor Darkness being _coëternal_ with Good or Light, and they give the same\r\ninterpretation. Ahriman is the manifested _Shadow_ of Ahura Mazda (Asura\r\nMazda), himself issued from Zeruâna Âkerne, the “Boundless [Circle of]\r\nTime,” or the Unknown Cause. They say of the latter:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Its glory is too exalted, its light too resplendent for either\r\n    human intellect or mortal eye to grasp and see.\r\n\r\n\r\nIts primal emanation _is Eternal Light, which, from having been previously\r\nconcealed in Darkness, was called to manifest itself and thus was formed\r\nOrmazd, the __“__King of Life.__”_ He is the “First‐born” in Boundless\r\nTime, but, like his own antetype (preëxisting spiritual idea), _has lived\r\nwithin Darkness from all Eternity_. The six Amshaspands—seven with\r\nhimself, the Chief of all—the primitive _Spiritual Angels and Men_, are\r\n_collectively_ his Logos. The Zoroastrian Amshaspands create the World in\r\nsix Days or periods also, and rest on the seventh; but in the Esoteric\r\nPhilosophy, that _seventh_ is the _first_ period or “Day,” the so‐called\r\n_Primary Creation_ in Âryan Cosmogony. It is that intermediate Æon which\r\nis the _Prologue_ to Creation, and which stands on the borderland between\r\nthe Uncreated Eternal Causation and the produced finite effects; a state\r\nof _nascent_ activity and energy as the first aspect of the Eternal\r\nImmutable Quiescence. In _Genesis_, on which no metaphysical energy has\r\nbeen spent, but only an extraordinary acuteness and ingenuity to veil the\r\nEsoteric Truth, Creation begins at the third stage of manifestation. “God”\r\nor the Elohim are the “Seven Regents” of _Pymander_. They are identical\r\nwith all the other Creators. But even in _Genesis_ that period is hinted\r\nat by the abruptness of the picture, and the “Darkness” that was on the\r\nface of the Deep. The Elohim are shown to “create”—that is to say, to\r\nbuild or to produce the two Heavens or “double” Heaven (_not_ Heaven and\r\nEarth); which means, in so many words, that they separated the upper\r\nmanifested (Angelic) Heaven, or plane of consciousness, from the lower or\r\nterrestrial plane; the (to us) Eternal and Immutable Æons from those\r\nPeriods that are in space, time and duration; Heaven from Earth, the\r\nUnknown from the Known—to the profane. Such is the meaning of the sentence\r\nin _Pymander_, which says that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Thought, the _divine_, which is Light and Life [Zeruâna Âkerne]\r\n    produced through its Word, or first aspect, the other, _operating_\r\n    Thought, which being the God of Spirit and Fire, constructed Seven\r\n    Regents enclosing within their Circle the World of Senses named\r\n    “Fatal Destiny.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe latter refers to Karma; the “Seven Circles” are the seven planets and\r\nplanes, as also the seven Invisible Spirits, in the Angelic Spheres, whose\r\nvisible symbols are the seven planets,(1119) the seven Rishis of the Great\r\nBear and other glyphs. As said of the Âdityas by Roth:\r\n\r\n\r\n    They are neither sun, nor moon, nor stars, nor dawn, but the\r\n    eternal sustainers of this luminous life which exists as it were\r\n    behind all these phenomena.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is they—the “Seven Hosts”—who, having “considered in their Father\r\n[Divine Thought] the plan of the operator,” as says _Pymander_, _desired_\r\nto operate (or build the world with its creatures) likewise; for, having\r\nbeen born “_within_ the Sphere of Operation”—the manifesting Universe—such\r\nis the Manvantaric Law. And now comes the second portion of the passage,\r\nor rather of two passages merged into one to conceal the full meaning.\r\nThose who were born within the Sphere of Operation were “the brothers who\r\nloved _him_ well.” The latter—the “him”—were the Primordial Angels; the\r\nAsuras, the Ahriman, the Elohim, or “Sons of God,” of whom Satan was\r\none—all those Spiritual Beings who were called the “Angels of Darkness,”\r\nbecause that Darkness is _absolute_ Light, a fact now neglected if not\r\nentirely forgotten in Theology. Nevertheless, the spirituality of those\r\nmuch abused “Sons of Light” which is Darkness, must be evidently as great,\r\nin comparison with that of the Angels next in order, as the ethereality of\r\nthe latter would be when contrasted with the density of the human body.\r\nThe former are the “First‐born,” and therefore so near to the confines of\r\nPure Quiescent Spirit as to be merely the “privations”—in the Aristotelian\r\nsense—the Ferouers or the ideal types of those who followed. They could\r\nnot create material, _corporeal_ things; and, therefore, were said in\r\nprocess of time to have “refused” to create, as “commanded” by\r\n“God”—otherwise, to have “_rebelled_.”\r\n\r\nPerchance, this is justified on the principle of the _scientific_ theory\r\nwhich teaches us as to the effect of two sound waves of equal length\r\nmeeting:\r\n\r\n\r\n    If the two sounds be of the same intensity, their coincidence\r\n    produces a sound four times the intensity of either, while their\r\n    interference produces _absolute silence_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile explaining some of the “heresies” of his day, Justin Martyr shows\r\nthe identity of all the world religions at their starting points. The\r\nfirst _Beginning_ opens invariably with the _Unknown_ and _Passive_ Deity,\r\nfrom which emanates a certain Active Power or Virtue, the Mystery that is\r\nsometimes called Wisdom, sometimes the Son, very often God, Angel, Lord,\r\nand Logos.(1120) The latter is sometimes applied to the very first\r\nEmanation, but in several systems it proceeds from the first Androgyne or\r\nDouble Ray produced at the beginning by the Unseen. Philo depicts this\r\nWisdom as male and female. But though its first manifestation had a\r\nbeginning—for it proceeded from Oulom(1121) (Aiôn, Time), the highest of\r\nthe Æons when emitted from the Father—it had remained with the Father\r\n_before all creations_, for it is part of him.(1122) Therefore Philo\r\nJudæus calls Adam Kadmon by the name “Mind”—the Ennoia of Bythos in the\r\nGnostic System. “The Mind, let it be named Adam.”(1123)\r\n\r\nAs the old Magian books explain it, the whole event becomes clear. A thing\r\ncan only exist through its opposite—Hegel teaches us; and only a little\r\nphilosophy and spirituality are needed to comprehend the origin of the\r\nlater dogma, which is so truly satanic and infernal in its cold and cruel\r\nwickedness. The Magians accounted for the Origin of Evil in their exoteric\r\nteachings in this way. “Light can produce nothing but Light, and can never\r\nbe the origin of Evil”; how then was Evil produced, since there was\r\nnothing coëqual or like the Light in its production? Light, say they,\r\nproduced several Beings, all of them spiritual, luminous, and powerful.\r\nBut a Great One (the “Great Asura,” Ahriman, Lucifer, etc.) had an _evil\r\nthought_, contrary to the Light. He doubted, and by that doubt he became\r\ndark.\r\n\r\nThis is a little nearer to the truth, but still wide of the mark. There\r\nwas _no_ “_evil_ thought” that originated the opposing Power, but simply\r\nThought _per se_; something which, being cogitative, and containing design\r\nand purpose, is therefore finite, and must thus find itself naturally in\r\nopposition to pure Quiescence, the as natural state of absolute\r\nSpirituality and Perfection. It was simply the Law of Evolution that\r\nasserted itself; the progress of Mental Unfolding, differentiated from\r\nSpirit, involved and entangled already with Matter, into which it is\r\nirresistibly drawn. Ideas, in their very nature and essence, as\r\nconceptions bearing relation to objects, whether true or imaginary, are\r\nopposed to Absolute Thought, that Unknowable All of whose mysterious\r\noperations Mr. Spencer predicates that nothing can be said, but that “it\r\nhas no kinship of nature with Evolution”(1124)—which it certainly has\r\nnot.(1125)\r\n\r\nThe _Zohar_ gives it very suggestively. When the “Holy One” (the Logos)\r\ndesired to create man, he called the _highest_ Host of Angels and spake\r\nunto them what he wanted, but they _doubted_ the wisdom of this desire and\r\nanswered: “Man will not continue one night in his glory”—for which they\r\nwere burnt (annihilated?), by the “Holy” Lord. Then he called another,\r\nlower Host, and said the same. And they contradicted the “Holy One”: “What\r\nis the good of Man?”—they argued. Still Elohim created Man, and when Man\r\n_sinned_ there came the Hosts of Uzza and Azael, and twitted God: “Here is\r\nthe Son of Man that thou hast made”—they said. “Behold, he sinned!” Then\r\nthe Holy One replied: “If you had been among them [Men] you would have\r\nbeen worse than they.” And he threw them from their exalted position in\r\nHeaven even down on to the Earth; and “they were changed [into Men] and\r\nsinned after the women of the earth.”(1126) This is quite plain. No\r\nmention is made in _Genesis_ (vi) of these “Sons of God” receiving\r\n_punishment_. The only reference to it in the _Bible_ is in _Jude_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    And the angels which kept not their first estate but left their\r\n    own habitation, he hath reserved in _everlasting chains_ under\r\n    _darkness_ unto the _judgment of the great day_.(1127)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd this means simply that the “Angels,” doomed to incarnation, are in the\r\n_chains_ of flesh and matter, under the _darkness_ of ignorance, till the\r\n“_Great Day_,” which will come as always after the Seventh Round, after\r\nthe expiration of the “Week,” on the Seventh Sabbath, or in the Post‐\r\nManvantaric Nirvâna.\r\n\r\nHow truly Esoteric and consonant with the Secret Doctrine is Pymander, the\r\nThought Divine, of Hermes, may be inferred from its original and primitive\r\ntranslations in Latin and Greek only. On the other hand how disfigured it\r\nhas been later on by Christians in Europe, is seen from the remarks and\r\nunconscious _confessions_ made by De St. Marc, in his Preface and Letter\r\nto the Bishop of Ayre, in 1578. Therein, the whole cycle of\r\ntransformations from a Pantheistic and Egyptian into a Mystic Roman\r\nCatholic treatise is given, and we see how _Pymander_ has become what it\r\nis now. Still, even in St. Marc’s translation, traces are found of the\r\nreal Pymander—the “Universal Thought” or “Mind.” This is the translation\r\nfrom the old French translation, the original being given in the foot‐\r\nnote(1128) in its quaint old French:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Seven men [principles] were generated in Man.... The nature of the\r\n    harmony of the Seven of the Father and of the Spirit. Nature ...\r\n    produced seven men in accordance with the natures of the Seven\r\n    Spirits ... having in them, potentially, the two sexes.\r\n\r\n\r\nMetaphysically, the Father and the Son are the “Universal Mind” and the\r\n“Periodical Universe”; the “Angel” and the “Man.” It is the Son and the\r\nFather at one and the same time; in Pymander, the _active_ Idea and the\r\n_passive_ Thought that generates it; the radical keynote in Nature which\r\ngives birth to the seven notes—the septenary scale of the Creative Forces,\r\nand to the seven prismatic _aspects_ of colour, all born from the one\r\nWhite Ray, or Light—itself generated in Darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC. The Many Meanings Of The “War In Heaven.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Secret Doctrine points out, as a self‐evident fact, that Mankind,\r\ncollectively and individually, is with all manifested Nature the vehicle\r\n(_a_) of the Breath of One Universal Principle, in its primal\r\ndifferentiation; and (_b_) of the countless “breaths” proceeding from that\r\nOne Breath in its secondary and further differentiations, as Nature with\r\nits many “mankinds” proceeds downwards toward the planes that are ever\r\nincreasing in materiality. The Primary Breath informs the higher\r\nHierarchies; the secondary—the lower, on the constantly descending planes.\r\n\r\nNow there are many passages in the _Bible_ which prove on their face,\r\n_exoterically_, that this belief was at one time _universal_; and the two\r\nmost convincing are _Ezekiel_, xxviii and _Isaiah_, xiv. Christian\r\nTheologians are welcome to interpret both as referring to the great War\r\nbefore Creation, the Epos of Satan’s Rebellion, etc., if they so choose,\r\nbut the absurdity of the idea is too apparent. Ezekiel addresses his\r\nlamentations and reproofs to the King of Tyre; Isaiah—to King Ahaz, who\r\nindulged in the worship of idols, as did the rest of the nation with the\r\nexception of a few Initiates (the Prophets, so‐called), who tried to\r\narrest it on its way to exotericism—or idolatry, which is the same thing.\r\nLet the student judge.\r\n\r\nIn _Ezekiel_, it is said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Son of Man, say unto the prince of Tyrus, Thus saith the Lord God\r\n    [as we understand it, the “God” Karma]; Because thine heart is\r\n    lifted up, and thou hast said I am a God, ... yet thou art a\r\n    man.... Behold, therefore, I will bring strangers upon thee: ...\r\n    and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom,\r\n    ... and they shall bring thee down to the pit [or Earth‐\r\n    life].(1129)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe origin of the “prince of Tyrus” is to be traced to the “Divine\r\nDynasties” of the iniquitous Atlanteans, the Great Sorcerers. There is no\r\nmetaphor in the words of Ezekiel, but actual _history_ this time. For the\r\nvoice _in_ the prophet, the voice of the “Lord,” his own Spirit, which\r\nspake unto him, says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Because ... thou hast said, I am a God, I sit in the seat of\r\n    God(s) [Divine Dynasties], in the midst of the seas; yet thou art\r\n    a man.... Behold, thou art wiser than Daniel; there is no secret\r\n    that they can hide from thee: with thy wisdom ... thou hast\r\n    increased thy riches, and thine heart is lifted up because of thy\r\n    riches. Behold, therefore ... strangers ... shall draw their\r\n    swords against the beauty of thy wisdom ... They shall bring thee\r\n    down ... and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in\r\n    the midst of the seas.(1130)\r\n\r\n\r\nAll such imprecations are not _prophecy_, but simply _reminders_ of the\r\nfate of the Atlanteans, the “Giants on Earth.”\r\n\r\nWhat can be the meaning of this last sentence if it is not a narrative of\r\nthe fate of the Atlanteans? Again, “Thine heart was lifted up because of\r\nthy beauty,”(1131) may refer to the “Heavenly Man” in _Pymander_, or to\r\nthe Fallen Angels, who are accused of having fallen through pride on\r\naccount of the great beauty and wisdom which became their lot. There is no\r\nmetaphor here, except in the preconceived ideas of our Theologians,\r\nperhaps. These verses relate to the Past and belong more to the Knowledge\r\nacquired at the Mysteries of Initiation than to retrospective\r\nclairvoyance! Says the voice, again:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Thou hast been in Eden, the garden of God [in the Satya Yuga];\r\n    every precious stone was thy covering: ... the workmanship of thy\r\n    tabrets and thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day thou wast\r\n    created. Thou art the anointed cherub; ... thou hast walked up and\r\n    down in the midst of the stones of fire.... Thou wast perfect in\r\n    thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was\r\n    found in thee. Therefore I will cast thee ... out of the mountain\r\n    of God, and ... destroy thee.(1132)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “Mountain of God” means the “Mountain of the Gods” or Meru, whose\r\nrepresentative in the Fourth Race was Mount Atlas, the _last form of one\r\nof the divine Titans_, so high in those days that the ancients believed\r\nthat the Heavens rested on its top. Did not Atlas assist the Giants in\r\ntheir War against the Gods (Hyginus)? Another version shows the _fable_ as\r\narising from the fondness of Atlas, son of Iapetus and Clymene, for\r\nAstronomy, and from his dwelling for that reason on the highest mountain\r\npeaks. The truth is that Atlas, the “Mountain of the Gods,” and also the\r\nhero of that name, are the Esoteric symbols of the Fourth Race, and his\r\nseven daughters, the Atlantides, are the symbols of its seven sub‐races.\r\nMount Atlas, according to all the legends, was three times as high as it\r\nis now; for it has sunk at two different times. It is of a volcanic\r\norigin, and therefore the voice within Ezekiel says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Therefore will I _bring forth a fire from the midst of thee_, it\r\n    shall devour thee.(1133)\r\n\r\n\r\nSurely it does not mean, as seems to be the case from the translated\r\ntexts, that this fire was to be brought from the midst of the Prince of\r\nTyrus, or his people, but from Mount Atlas, symbolizing the proud Race,\r\nlearned in Magic and high in arts and civilization, whose last remnant was\r\ndestroyed almost at the foot of the range of those once gigantic\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nTruly, “thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more”;(1134)\r\nas the very name of the Race and its fate is now annihilated from man’s\r\nmemory. Bear in mind that almost every ancient king and priest was an\r\nInitiate; that from toward the close of the Fourth Race there had been a\r\nfeud between the Initiates of the Right and those of the Left Path;\r\nfinally, that the Garden of Eden is referred to by other personages than\r\nthe Jews of the Adamic Race, since even Pharaoh is compared to the fairest\r\ntree of Eden by this same Ezekiel, who shows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    All the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, ...\r\n    comforted in the nether parts of the earth. [For] they also went\r\n    down into hell with him [Pharaoh](1135)\r\n\r\n\r\n—unto the nether parts, which are in fact the bottom of the ocean, whose\r\nfloor gaped wide to devour the lands of the Atlanteans and themselves. If\r\none bears all this in mind and compares the various accounts, then one\r\nwill find out that chapters xxviii and xxxi of _Ezekiel_ do not relate to\r\nBabylon, Assyria, nor yet to Egypt, since none of these have been so\r\ndestroyed, having simply fallen into ruins on the _surface_, not _beneath_\r\nthe earth—but indeed to Atlantis and most of its nations. And he will see\r\nthat the “Garden of Eden” of the Initiates was no myth, but a locality now\r\nsubmerged. Light will dawn upon him, and he will appreciate such sentences\r\nas these at their true Esoteric value: “Thou hast been in Eden; ... thou\r\nwast upon the holy mountain of God”(1136)—for every nation had and many\r\nstill have _holy_ mountains; some Himâlayan Peaks, others Parnassus and\r\nSinai. They were all places of Initiation and the abodes of the Chiefs of\r\nthe communities of ancient and even modern Adepts. And again:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Behold, the Assyrian [why not Atlantean, Initiate?] was a cedar in\r\n    Lebanon; ... his height was exalted above all the trees.... The\r\n    cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: ... so that all\r\n    the trees of Eden ... envied him.(1137)\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout all Asia Minor, the Initiates were called the “Trees of\r\nRighteousness,” and the Cedars of Lebanon, as also were some kings of\r\nIsrael. So were the great Adepts in India, but only the Adepts of the Left\r\nHand. When _Vishnu Purâna_ narrates that “the world was over‐run with\r\ntrees,” while the Prachetasas, who “passed 10,000 years of austerity in\r\nthe vast ocean,” were absorbed in their devotions, the allegory relates to\r\nthe Atlanteans and the Adepts of the early Fifth Race—the Âryans. Other\r\n“_trees_ [Adept Sorcerers] spread, and over‐shadowed the unprotected\r\nearth; and the people perished ... unable to labour for ten thousand\r\nyears.” Then the Sages, the Rishis of the Âryan Race, called Prachetasas,\r\nare shown “coming forth _from the deep_,”(1138) and destroying by the wind\r\nand flame issuing from their mouths the iniquitous “Trees” and the whole\r\nvegetable kingdom; until Soma (the Moon), the sovereign of the vegetable\r\nworld, pacifies them by making alliance with the Adepts of the Right Path,\r\nto whom he offers as bride Mârishâ, the “offspring of the trees.”(1139)\r\nThis hints at the great struggle between the “Sons of God” and the Sons of\r\nthe Dark Wisdom—our forefathers; or the Atlantean and the Âryan Adepts.\r\n\r\nThe whole history of that period is allegorized in the _Râmâyana_, which\r\nis the mystic narrative in epic form of the struggle between Râma—the\r\nfirst king of the Divine Dynasty of the early Âryans—and Râvana, the\r\nsymbolical personation of the Atlantean (Lankâ) Race. The former were the\r\nincarnations of the Solar Gods; the latter, of the Lunar Devas. This was\r\nthe great battle between Good and Evil, between White and Black Magic, for\r\nthe supremacy of the divine forces over the lower terrestrial, or cosmic\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nIf the student would understand better the last statement, let him turn to\r\nthe Anugîtâ episode of the _Mahâbhârata_, where the Brâhmana tells his\r\nwife:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I have perceived by means of the Self the seat abiding in the\r\n    Self—(the seat) where dwells the Brahman free from the pairs of\r\n    opposites, and the moon, together with the fire [or the sun],\r\n    upholding (all) beings (as) the mover of the intellectual\r\n    principle.(1140)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Moon _is_ the deity of the mind (Manas) but only on the lower plane.\r\nSays a Commentary:\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Manas is dual—Lunar in the lower, Solar in its upper portion._\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is to say, it is attracted in its higher aspect towards Buddhi, and\r\nin its lower descends into, and listens to the voice of, its _animal_ Soul\r\nfull of selfish and sensual desires; and herein is contained the mystery\r\nof an Adept’s and of a profane man’s life, as also that of the _post\r\nmortem_ separation of the divine from the animal Man. The\r\n_Mahâbhârata_—every line of which has to be read Esoterically—discloses in\r\nmagnificent symbolism and allegory the tribulations of both Man and Soul.\r\nSays the Brâhmana in the _Anugîtâ_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the interior (within the body), in the midst of all these\r\n    (life‐winds) [? principles], which move about in the body and\r\n    swallow up one another,(1141) blazes the Vaishvânara fire(1142)\r\n    sevenfold.(1143)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the chief “Soul” is Manas or mind; hence, Soma, the Moon, is shown as\r\nmaking an alliance with the solar portion in it, personified as the\r\nPrachetasas. But of the seven keys that open the seven aspects of the\r\n_Râmâyana_, as of every other Scripture, this is only one—the\r\nmetaphysical.\r\n\r\nThe symbol of the “Tree” standing for various Initiates was almost\r\nuniversal. Jesus is called the “Tree of Life,” as are also all the Adepts\r\nof the Good Law, while those of the Left Path are referred to as the\r\n“withering trees.” John the Baptist speaks of the “axe” which “is laid to\r\nthe root of the trees”;(1144) and the king of Assyria’s armies are called\r\n“trees.”(1145)\r\n\r\nThe true meaning of the Garden of Eden has been sufficiently given in\r\n_Isis Unveiled_. Now the writer has more than once heard surprise\r\nexpressed that _Isis Unveiled_ should contain so few of the doctrines now\r\ntaught. This is quite erroneous. For the allusions to such teachings are\r\nplentiful, even if the teachings themselves were withheld. The time had\r\nnot arrived then, as the hour has not struck even now, _to say all_. “No\r\nAtlanteans, or the Fourth Race which preceded our Fifth Race, are\r\nmentioned in _Isis Unveiled_,” wrote a critic on _Esoteric Buddhism_ one\r\nday. I, who wrote _Isis Unveiled_, maintain that the Atlanteans _are_\r\nmentioned as our predecessors. For what can be plainer than the following\r\nstatement, when speaking of the Book of Job:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the original text, instead of “dead things,” it is written dead\r\n    _Rephaim_ (giants, or mighty primitive men), from whom “Evolution”\r\n    _may one day trace our present race_.(1146)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is invited to do so now, now that this hint is explained quite openly;\r\nbut Evolutionists are as sure to decline nowadays as they did ten years\r\nago. Science and Theology are against us: therefore we question both, and\r\nhave to do so in self‐defence. On the strength of hazy metaphors scattered\r\nthroughout the prophets, and in St. John’s _Revelation_, a grand but\r\nreëdited version of the _Book of Enoch_, on these insecure grounds\r\nChristian Theology has built its dogmatic Epos of the War in Heaven. It\r\nhas done more: it has used the symbolical visions, intelligible only to\r\nthe Initiates, as pillars upon which to support the whole bulky edifice of\r\nits religion; and now the pillars have been found very weak reeds, and the\r\ncunning structure is foundering. The entire Christian scheme rests upon\r\nthis Jakin and Boaz—the two contrary forces of Good and Evil, Christ and\r\nSatan, αἱ ἀγαθαὶ καὶ αἱ κακαὶ δυνάμεις. Take away from Christianity its\r\nmain prop of the Fallen Angels, and the Eden Bower vanishes, with its Adam\r\nand Eve, into thin air; and Christ, in the exclusive character of the One\r\nGod and Saviour, and the Victim of Atonement for the sin of animal‐man,\r\nbecomes forthwith a useless, meaningless myth.\r\n\r\nIn an old number of the _Revue Archéologique_, a French writer, M. Maury,\r\nremarks:\r\n\r\n\r\n    This universal strife between good and bad spirits seems to be\r\n    only the reproduction of _another more ancient and more terrible\r\n    strife_, which, according to an ancient myth, took place before\r\n    the creation of the universe, between the faithful and the\r\n    rebellious legions.(1147)\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce more, it is a simple question of priority. Had John’s _Revelation_\r\nbeen written during the Vedic period, and were not one sure now of its\r\nbeing simply another version of the _Book of Enoch_ and the Dragon legends\r\nof Pagan antiquity—the grandeur and the beauty of the imagery might have\r\nbiassed the critics’ opinion in favour of the Christian interpretation of\r\nthat first War, whose battle‐field was starry Heaven, and the first\r\nslaughterers—the Angels. As the matter now stands, however, one has to\r\ntrace _Revelation_, event by event, to other and far older visions. For\r\nthe better comprehension of the apocalyptic allegories and of the Esoteric\r\nepos we ask the reader to turn to _Revelation_, and to read chapter xii,\r\nfrom verse 1 to verse 7.\r\n\r\nThis has several meanings, and much has been found out with regard to the\r\nastronomical and numerical keys of this universal myth. That which may be\r\nnow given, is a fragment, a few hints as to its secret meaning, as\r\nembodying the record of a real war, the struggle between the Initiates of\r\nthe two Schools. Many and various are the still existing allegories built\r\non this same foundation stone. The true narrative—that which gives the\r\nfull Esoteric meaning—is in the Secret Books, but the writer has had no\r\naccess to these.\r\n\r\nIn the exoteric works, however, the episode of the Târaka War, and some\r\nEsoteric Commentaries, may offer a clue perhaps. In every _Purâna_ the\r\nevent is described with more or less variations which show its allegorical\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nIn the Mythology of the earliest Vaidic Âryans as in the later Paurânic\r\nnarratives, mention is made of Budha, the “Wise,” one “learned in the\r\nSecret Wisdom,” who is the planet Mercury in his euhemerization. The\r\n_Hindû Classical Dictionary_ credits Budha with being the author of a hymn\r\nin the _Rig Veda_. Therefore, he can by no means be “a later fiction of\r\nthe Brâhmans,” but is a very old personation indeed.\r\n\r\nIt is by enquiring into his genealogy, or theogony rather, that the\r\nfollowing facts are disclosed. As a myth, he is the son of Târâ, the wife\r\nof Brihaspati, the “gold coloured,” and of Soma, the (male) Moon who,\r\nParis‐like, carries this new Helen of the Hindû Sidereal Kingdom away from\r\nher husband. This causes a great strife and _war_ in Svarga (Heaven). The\r\nepisode brings on a battle between the Gods and the Asuras. King Soma\r\nfinds allies in Ushanas (Venus), the leader of the Dânavas; and the Gods\r\nare led by Indra and Rudra, who side with Brihaspati. The latter is helped\r\nby Shankara (Shiva), who, having had for his Guru Brihaspati’s father,\r\nAngiras, befriends his son. Indra is here the Indian prototype of Michael,\r\nthe Archistrategus and the slayer of the “Dragon’s” Angels—since one of\r\nhis names is Jishnu, “leader of the celestial host.” Both fight, as some\r\nTitans did against other Titans in defence of revengeful Gods, the one\r\nparty in defence of Jupiter Tonans (in India, Brihaspati is the planet\r\nJupiter, which is a curious coincidence); the other in support of the\r\never‐thundering Rudra. During this war, Indra is deserted by his body‐\r\nguard, the Storm‐Gods (Maruts). The story is very suggestive in some of\r\nits details.\r\n\r\nLet us examine some of them, and seek to discover their meaning.\r\n\r\nThe presiding Genius, or “Regent” of the planet Jupiter is Brihaspati, the\r\nwronged husband. He is the Instructor or Spiritual Guru of the Gods, who\r\nare the representatives of the Procreative Powers. In the _Rig Veda_, he\r\nis called Brahmanaspati, the name “of a deity in whom _the action of the\r\nworshipped_ upon the gods is personified.” Hence Brahmanaspati represents\r\nthe materialization of the “Divine Grace,” so to say, by means of ritual\r\nand ceremonies, or the exoteric worship.\r\n\r\nTârâ,(1148) his wife, is, on the other hand, the personification of the\r\npowers of one initiated into Gupta Vidyâ (Secret Knowledge), as will be\r\nshown.\r\n\r\nSoma is the Moon astronomically; but in mystical phraseology it is also\r\nthe name of the sacred beverage drunk by the Brâhmans and the Initiates\r\nduring their mysteries and sacrificial rites. The Soma plant is the\r\n_asclepias acida_, which yields a juice from which that mystic beverage,\r\nthe Soma drink, is made. Alone the descendants of the Rishis, the\r\nAgnihotris, or Fire‐priests, of the great Mysteries knew all its powers.\r\nBut the real property of the _true_ Soma was (and _is_) to make a “new\r\nman” of the Initiate, after he is “reborn,” namely once that he begins to\r\nlive in his _Astral_ Body;(1149) for, his spiritual nature overcoming the\r\nphysical, he would soon snap it off and part even from that etherealized\r\nform.(1150)\r\n\r\nSoma was never given in days of old to the non‐initiated Brâhman—the\r\nsimple Grihasta, or priest of the exoteric ritual. Thus Brihaspati, “Guru\r\nof the Gods” though he was, still represented the dead‐letter form of\r\nworship. It is Târâ, his _wife_, the symbol of one who, though wedded to\r\ndogmatic worship, longs for true Wisdom, who is shown as initiated into\r\nhis mysteries by King Soma, the giver of that Wisdom. Soma is thus made\r\n_to carry her away_ in the allegory. The result of this is the birth of\r\nBudha, _Esoteric Wisdom_—Mercury, or Hermes, in Greece and Egypt. He is\r\nrepresented as “so beautiful,” that even the husband, though well aware\r\nthat Budha is not the progeny of his dead‐letter worship—claims the “new‐\r\nborn” as his Son, the fruit of his ritualistic and meaningless\r\nforms.(1151) Such is, in brief, _one_ of the meanings of the allegory.\r\n\r\nThe War in Heaven refers to several events of this kind on various and\r\ndifferent planes of being. The first is a purely astronomical and cosmical\r\nfact pertaining to Cosmogony. Mr. John Bentley thought that with the\r\nHindûs the War in Heaven was only a figure referring to their calculations\r\nof time periods.(1152)\r\n\r\nThis served as a prototype, he thinks, for the Western nations to build\r\ntheir War of the Titans upon. The author is not quite wrong, but neither\r\nis he quite right. If the sidereal prototype refers indeed to a pre‐\r\nmanvantaric period, and rests entirely on the knowledge which the Âryan\r\nInitiates claim they have of the whole programme and progress of\r\ncosmogony,(1153) the War of the Titans is but a legendary and deified copy\r\nof the real war that took place in the Himâlayan Kailâsa (Heaven) instead\r\nof in the depths of cosmic interplanetary Space. It is the record of the\r\nterrible strife between the “Sons of God” and the “Sons of the Shadow” of\r\nthe Fourth and the Fifth Races. It is on these two events, blended\r\ntogether by legends borrowed from the exoteric account of the War waged by\r\nthe Asuras against the Gods, that every subsequent national tradition on\r\nthe subject has been built.\r\n\r\nEsoterically, the Asuras, transformed subsequently into evil Spirits and\r\nlower Gods, who are eternally at war with the _Great_ Deities—are the Gods\r\nof the Secret Wisdom. In the oldest portions of the _Rig Veda_, they are\r\nthe Spiritual and the Divine, the term Asura being used for the Supreme\r\nSpirit and being the same as the great Ahura of the Zoroastrians.(1154)\r\nThere was a time when the Gods Indra, Agni, and Varuna themselves belonged\r\nto the Asuras.\r\n\r\nIn the _Taittirîya Brâhmana_, the Breath (Asu) of Brahmâ‐Prajâpati became\r\nalive, and from that Breath he created the Asuras. Later on, after the\r\nWar, the Asuras are called the enemies of the Gods, hence—“_A_‐suras,” the\r\ninitial _a_ being a negative prefix—or “_No_‐Gods”; the “Gods” being\r\nreferred to as Suras. This then connects the Asuras and their “Hosts,”\r\nenumerated further on, with the “Fallen Angels” of the Christian Churches,\r\na Hierarchy of Spiritual Beings to be found in every Pantheon of ancient\r\nand even modern nations—from the Zoroastrian down to that of the Chinaman.\r\nThey are the Sons of the primeval Creative Breath at the beginning of\r\nevery new Mahâ Kalpa, or Manvantara, in the same rank as the Angels who\r\nhad remained “faithful.” These were the _allies_ of Soma (the parent of\r\nthe Esoteric Wisdom) as against Brihaspati (representing ritualistic or\r\nceremonial worship). Evidently they have been degraded in Space and Time\r\ninto opposing Powers or Demons by the ceremonialists, on account of their\r\nrebellion against hypocrisy, sham‐worship, and the dead‐letter form.\r\n\r\nNow what is the real character of all those who fought along with them?\r\nThey are:\r\n\r\n(1) Ushanas, or the “Host” of the Planet Venus, become now in Roman\r\nCatholicism Lucifer, the Genius of the “day star,”(1155) the Tsaba, or\r\nArmy of “Satan.”\r\n\r\n(2) The Daityas and Dânavas are the Titans, the Demons and Giants whom we\r\nfind in the _Bible_(1156)—the progeny of the “Sons of God” and the\r\n“Daughters of Men.” Their generic name shows their alleged character, and\r\ndiscloses at the same time the secret _animus_ of the Brâhmans; for they\r\nare the Kratu‐dvishas—the “enemies of the sacrifices” or exoteric _shams_.\r\nThese are the “Hosts” that fought against Brihaspati, the representative\r\nof _exoteric_ popular and national religions; and Indra—the God of the\r\n_visible_ Heaven, the Firmament, who, in the early _Veda_, is the\r\n_highest_ God of cosmic Heaven, the fit habitation for an _extra_‐cosmic\r\nand personal God, higher than whom no exoteric worship can ever soar.\r\n\r\n(3) Then come the Nâgas,(1157) the Sarpas, Serpents or Seraphs. These,\r\nagain, show their character by the hidden meaning of their glyph. In\r\nmythology they are _semi‐divine_ beings with a human face and the tail of\r\na dragon. They are therefore, undeniably, the Jewish Seraphim (compare\r\nSerapis, Sarpa, Serpent); the singular being Saraph, “burning, fiery.”\r\nChristian and Jewish angelology distinguishes between the Seraphim and the\r\nCherubim or Cherubs, who come second in order: Esoterically, and\r\nkabalistically, they are identical; the Cherubim being simply the name for\r\nthe images or likenesses of any of the divisions of the celestial Hosts.\r\nNow, as said before, the Dragons and Nâgas were the names given to the\r\nInitiate‐hermits, on account of their great Wisdom and Spirituality and\r\ntheir living in caves. Thus, when Ezekiel(1158) applies the adjective\r\nCherub to the King of Tyre, and tells him that by his _wisdom_ and his\r\n_understanding_ there is _no secret_ that can be hidden from him, he shows\r\nthe Occultist that it is a “Prophet,” perhaps still a follower of\r\n_exoteric_ worship, who fulminates against an Initiate of another school\r\nand not against an imaginary Lucifer, a fallen Cherub from the stars, and\r\nthen from the Garden of Eden. Thus the so‐called “War” is, in one of its\r\nmany meanings, also an allegorical record of the strife between the two\r\nclasses of Adepts—of the Right and of the Left Path. There were three\r\nclasses of Rishis in India, who were the earliest Adepts known; the Royal,\r\nor Râjarshis, kings and princes, who adopted the ascetic life; the Divine,\r\nor Devarshis, or the sons of Dharma or Yoga; and the Brahmarshis,\r\ndescendants of those Rishis who were the founders of Gotras of Brâhmans,\r\nor caste‐races. Now, leaving the mythical and astronomical keys for one\r\nmoment aside, the secret teachings show many Atlanteans who belonged to\r\nthese divisions; and there were strifes and wars between them, _de facto_\r\nand _de jure_. Nârada, one of the greatest Rishis, was a Devarshi; and he\r\nis shown in constant and everlasting feud with Brahmâ, Daksha, and other\r\nGods and Sages. Therefore we may safely maintain that whatever the\r\n_astronomical_ meaning of this universally accepted legend may be, its\r\nhuman phase is based on real and historical events, disfigured into a\r\ntheological dogma only to suit ecclesiastical purposes. As above so below.\r\nSidereal phenomena, and the behaviour of the celestial bodies in the\r\nHeavens, were taken as a model, and the plan was carried out below, on\r\nEarth. Thus, Space, in its abstract sense, was called the “realm of divine\r\nknowledge,” and by the Chaldees or Initiates Ab Soo, the habitat (or\r\nfather, _i.e._, the source) of knowledge, because it is in Space that\r\ndwell the intelligent Powers which _invisibly_ rule the Universe.(1159)\r\n\r\nIn the same manner, and on the plan of the Zodiac in the _upper_ Ocean or\r\nthe Heavens, a certain realm on Earth, an inland sea, was consecrated and\r\ncalled the “Abyss of Learning”; twelve centres on it, in the shape of\r\ntwelve small islands, representing the Zodiacal Signs—two of which\r\nremained for ages the “mystery Signs”(1160)—were the abodes of twelve\r\nHierophants and Masters of Wisdom. This “Sea of Knowledge” or\r\nlearning(1161) remained for ages there, where now stretches the Shamo or\r\nGobi Desert. It existed until the last great glacial period, when a local\r\ncataclysm, which swept the waters South and West and so formed the present\r\ngreat desolate desert, left only a certain oasis, with a lake and one\r\nisland in the midst of it, as a relic of the Zodiacal Ring on Earth. For\r\nages the Watery Abyss—which, with the nations that preceded the later\r\nBabylonians, was the abode of the “Great Mother,” the terrestrial post‐\r\ntype of the “Great Mother Chaos” in Heaven, the parent of Ea (Wisdom),\r\nhimself the early prototype of Oannes, the Man‐Fish of the Babylonians—for\r\nages, then, the “Abyss” or Chaos was the abode of Wisdom and not of Evil.\r\nThe struggle of Bel and then of Merodach, the Sun‐God, with Tiamat, the\r\nSea and its Dragon—a “War” which ended in the defeat of the latter—has a\r\npurely cosmic and geological meaning, as well as a historical one. It is a\r\npage torn out of the history of the Secret and Sacred Sciences, their\r\nevolution, growth and _death—for the profane masses_. It relates (_a_) to\r\nthe systematic and gradual drying up of immense territories by the fierce\r\nSun at a certain pre‐historic period, one of the terrible droughts which\r\nended by a gradual transformation of once fertile lands abundantly watered\r\ninto the sandy deserts which they are now; and (_b_) to the as systematic\r\npersecution of the Prophets of the Right Path by those of the Left. The\r\nlatter, having inaugurated the birth and evolution of the sacerdotal\r\ncastes, have finally led the world into all those exoteric religions,\r\nwhich have been invented to satisfy the depraved taste of the “hoi polloi”\r\nand the ignorant for ritualistic pomp and the materialization of the ever‐\r\nimmaterial and Unknowable Principle.\r\n\r\nThis was a certain improvement on the Atlantean sorcery, the memory of\r\nwhich lingers in the remembrance of all the literary and Sanskrit‐reading\r\nportion of India, as well as in the popular legends. Still it was a parody\r\non, and the desecration of, the Sacred Mysteries and their Science. The\r\nrapid progress of anthropomorphism and idolatry led the early Fifth, as it\r\nhad already led the Fourth Race, into sorcery once more, though on a\r\nsmaller scale. Finally, even the four “Adams” (symbolizing, under other\r\nnames, the four preceding Races) were forgotten, and, passing from one\r\ngeneration into another, each loaded with some additional myths, were at\r\nlast drowned in that ocean of popular symbolism called the Pantheons. Yet\r\nthey exist to this day in the oldest Jewish traditions: the first as the\r\nTzelem, the “Shadow‐Adam,” the Chhâyâs of our doctrine; the second, the\r\n“Model” Adam, the copy of the first, and the “male and female” of the\r\nexoteric _Genesis_; the third, the “Earthly Adam” before the Fall, an\r\nandrogyne; and the fourth, the Adam after his “fall,” _i.e._, separated\r\ninto sexes, or the pure Atlantean. The Adam of the Garden of Eden, or the\r\nforefather of our Race—the fifth—is an ingenious compound of the above\r\nfour. As stated in the _Zohar_, Adam, the first Man, is not found now on\r\nEarth, he “is not found in all Below.” For where does the lower Earth come\r\nfrom? “From the _Chain of the Earth_, and from the _Heaven Above_,”\r\n_i.e._, from the superior Globes, those which precede and are above our\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\n\r\n    And there came out from it [the Chain] creatures differing one\r\n    from the other. Some of them in garments [solid] (skins), some in\r\n    shells (_Q’lippoth_), ... some in red shells, some in black, some\r\n    in white, and some from all the colours.(1162)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs in the Chaldæan Cosmogony of Berosus and the Stanzas just given, some\r\ntreatises on the _Kabalah_ speak of creatures with two faces, some with\r\nfour, and some with one face; for “the highest Adam did not come down in\r\nall the countries, or produce progeny and have many wives,” but is a\r\nmystery.\r\n\r\nSo is the Dragon a mystery. Truly says Rabbi Simeon Ben Iochaï, that to\r\nunderstand the meaning of the Dragon is not given to the “companions”\r\n(students, or Chelâs), but only to the “little ones,” _i.e._, the perfect\r\nInitiates.(1163)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The work of the beginning the companions understand; but it is\r\n    only the little ones who understand the parable on the work in the\r\n    Principium by the _Mystery of the Serpent of the Great Sea_.(1164)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd those Christians, who may happen to read this, will also understand by\r\nthe light of the above sentence who their “Christ” was. For Jesus states\r\nrepeatedly that he who “shall not receive the Kingdom of God as a _little\r\nchild_, he shall not enter therein”; and if some of his sayings have been\r\nmeant to apply to children without any metaphor, most of the references to\r\nthe “little ones” in the Gospels, relate to the Initiates, _of whom Jesus\r\nwas one_. Paul (Saul) is referred to in the _Talmud_ as the “little one.”\r\n\r\nThe “Mystery of the Serpent” was this: Our Earth, or rather _terrestrial\r\nlife_, is often referred to in the Secret Teachings as the Great Sea, the\r\n“Sea of Life” having remained to this day a favourite metaphor. The\r\n_Siphra Dtzenioutha_ speaks of Primeval Chaos and the Evolution of the\r\nUniverse after a Destruction (Pralaya), comparing it to an uncoiling\r\nserpent:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Extending hither and thither, its tail in its mouth, the head\r\n    twisting on its neck, it is enraged and angry.... It watches and\r\n    conceals itself. Every thousand _Days_ it is manifested.(1165)\r\n\r\n\r\nA commentary on the _Purânas_ says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ananta‐Shesha is a form of Vishnu, the Holy Spirit of\r\n    Preservation, and a symbol of the Universe, on which it is\r\n    supposed to sleep during the intervals of the _Days_ of Brahmâ.\r\n    The seven heads of Shesha support the Universe.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the Spirit of God “sleeps,” or is “breathing” over the Chaos of\r\nUndifferentiated Matter, before each new “Creation,” says the _Siphra\r\nDtzenioutha_. Now one Day of Brahmâ is composed, as already explained, of\r\n_one thousand_ Mahâ Yugas; and as each Night, or period of rest, is equal\r\nin duration to this Day, it is easy to see what this sentence in the\r\n_Siphra Dtzenioutha_ refers to—viz., that the Serpent manifests “once in a\r\nthousand days.” Nor is it more difficult to see whither the initiated\r\nwriter of the _Siphra_ is leading us, when he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Its head is broken in the waters of the Great Sea, as it is\r\n    written: Thou dividest the sea by thy strength, thou brakest the\r\n    _heads_ of the _dragons_ in the waters.(1166)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt refers to the trials of the Initiates in this physical life, the “Sea\r\nof Sorrow,” if read with one key; it hints at the successive destruction\r\nof the seven Spheres of a Chain of Worlds in the Great Sea of Space, when\r\nread with another key; for every sidereal globe or sphere, every world,\r\nstar, or group of stars, is called in symbolism a “Dragon’s Head.” But\r\nhowever it may read, the Dragon was never regarded as Evil, nor was the\r\nSerpent either—in antiquity. In the metaphors, whether astronomical,\r\ncosmical, theogonical or simply physiological (or phallic), the Serpent\r\nwas always regarded as a _divine_ symbol. When mention is made of “the\r\n[Cosmic] Serpent which runs with 370 leaps,”(1167) it means the cyclic\r\nperiods of the great Tropical Year of 25,868 years, divided in the\r\nEsoteric calculation into 370 periods or cycles, as one solar year is\r\ndivided into 365 days. And if Michael was regarded by the Christians as\r\nthe Conqueror of Satan, the Dragon, it is because in the _Talmud_ this\r\nfighting personage is represented as the Prince of Waters, who had seven\r\nsubordinate Spirits under him—a good reason why the Latin Church made him\r\nthe patron saint of every promontory in Europe. In the _Siphra\r\nDtzenioutha_ the Creative Force “makes sketches and spiral lines of his\r\ncreation _in the shape of a Serpent_.” It “holds its tail in its mouth,”\r\nbecause it is the symbol of endless eternity and of cyclic periods. Its\r\nmeanings, however, would require a volume, and we must end.\r\n\r\nThus the reader may now see for himself what are the several meanings of\r\nthe “War in Heaven,” and of the “Great Dragon.” Thus the most solemn and\r\ndreaded of Church dogmas, the alpha and omega of the Christian faith, and\r\nthe pillar of its Fall and Atonement, dwindles down to a Pagan symbol, in\r\nthe many allegories of these pre‐historic struggles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection V. Is Plerôma Satan’s Lair?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject is not yet exhausted, and has to be examined from still other\r\naspects.\r\n\r\nWhether Milton’s grandiose description of the three _days’_ Battle of the\r\nAngels of Light against those of Darkness justifies the suspicion that he\r\nmust have heard of the corresponding Eastern tradition—it is impossible to\r\nsay. Nevertheless, if not himself in connection with some Mystic, then it\r\nmust have been through some one who had obtained access to the secret\r\nworks of the Vatican. Among these there is a tradition concerning the\r\n“Beni Shamash”—the “Children of the Sun”—relating to the Eastern allegory,\r\nwith far more minute details _in its triple version_, than one can get\r\neither from the _Book of Enoch_, or the far more recent _Revelation_ of\r\nSt. John concerning the “Old Dragon” and his various Slayers, as has been\r\njust shown.\r\n\r\nIt seems inexplicable to find, to this day, authors belonging to mystical\r\nsocieties who yet continue in their preconceived doubts as to the\r\n“alleged” antiquity of the _Book of Enoch_. Thus, while the author of the\r\n_Sacred Mysteries among the Mayas and Quiches_ is inclined to see in Enoch\r\nan Initiate converted to Christianity (!!),(1168) the English compiler of\r\nÉliphas Lévi’s works, _The Mysteries of Magic_, is also of a like opinion.\r\nHe remarks that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Outside the erudition of Dr. Kenealy, no modern scholarship\r\n    attributes any more remote antiquity to the latter work [the _Book\r\n    of Enoch_] than the fourth century B.C.(1169)\r\n\r\n\r\nModern scholarship has been guilty of worse errors than this one. It seems\r\nbut yesterday that the _greatest_ literary critics in Europe denied the\r\nvery authenticity of that work, together with the Orphic Hymns, and even\r\nthe Book of Hermes or Thoth, until whole verses from the latter were\r\ndiscovered on Egyptian monuments and tombs of the earliest dynasties. The\r\nopinion of Archbishop Laurence is quoted elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe “Old Dragon” and Satan, which have now become singly and collectively\r\nthe symbol of, and the theological term for, the “Fallen Angel,” are not\r\nso described either in the _original_ Kabalah (the Chaldæan _Book of\r\nNumbers_) or in the modern. For the most learned, if not the greatest of\r\nmodern Kabalists, namely Éliphas Lévi, describes Satan in the following\r\nglowing terms:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is that Angel who was proud enough to believe himself God;\r\n    brave enough to buy his independence at the price of eternal\r\n    suffering and torture; beautiful enough to have adored himself in\r\n    full divine light; strong enough to still reign in darkness amidst\r\n    agony, and to have made himself a throne out of his\r\n    inextinguishable pyre. It is the Satan of the republican and\r\n    heretical Milton ... the prince of anarchy, served by a hierarchy\r\n    of pure spirits(!!).(1170)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis description—one which reconciles so cunningly Theological dogma and\r\nKabalistic allegory, and even contrives to include a political compliment\r\nin its phraseology—is, when read in the right spirit, quite correct.\r\n\r\nYes, indeed; it is this grandest of ideals, this ever‐living symbol—nay\r\napotheosis—of self‐sacrifice for the intellectual independence of\r\nhumanity; this ever Active Energy protesting against Static Inertia—the\r\nprinciple to which Self‐assertion is a crime, and Thought and the Light of\r\nKnowledge odious. As Éliphas says with unparalleled justice and irony:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is this pretended hero of tenebrous eternities, who,\r\n    slanderously charged with ugliness, is decorated with horns and\r\n    claws, which would fit far better his implacable tormentor.(1171)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is he who has been finally transformed into a Serpent—the Red Dragon.\r\nBut Éliphas Lévi was yet too subservient to his Roman Catholic\r\nauthorities—one may add, too jesuitical—to confess that this Devil was\r\nmankind, and never had any existence on Earth outside of that\r\nmankind.(1172)\r\n\r\nIn this, Christian Theology, although following slavishly in the steps of\r\nPaganism, has only been true to its own time‐honoured policy. It had to\r\nisolate itself, and to assert its authority. Hence it could not do better\r\nthan turn every Pagan Deity into a Devil. Every bright Sun‐God of\r\nantiquity—a glorious Deity by day, and its own Opponent and Adversary by\r\nnight, named the Dragon of Wisdom, because it was supposed to contain the\r\ngerms of night and day—has now been turned into the antithetical Shadow of\r\nGod, and has become Satan on the sole and unsupported authority of\r\ndespotic human dogma. After which all these producers of light and shadow,\r\nall the Sun‐ and the Moon‐Gods, have been cursed, and thus the one God\r\nchosen out of the many and Satan have both been anthropomorphized. But\r\nTheology seems to have lost sight of the human capacity for discriminating\r\nand finally analyzing all that is artificially forced upon its reverence.\r\nHistory shows in every race and even tribe, especially in the Semitic\r\nnations, the natural impulse to exalt its own tribal deity above all\r\nothers to the hegemony of the Gods, and proves that the God of the\r\nIsraelites was such a _tribal_ God, and no more, even though the Christian\r\nChurch, following the lead of the “chosen” people, is pleased to enforce\r\nthe worship of that one particular deity, and to anathematize all the\r\nothers. Whether originally a conscious or an unconscious blunder,\r\nnevertheless, it _was_ one. Jehovah has ever been in antiquity only a God\r\n“among” other “Gods.”(1173) The _Lord_ appears to Abraham, and while\r\nsaying, “I am the _Almighty God_,” yet adds, “I will establish my covenant\r\n... to be _a_ God unto thee” (Abraham); and unto _his seed_ after\r\nhim(1174)—but not unto Âryan Europeans.\r\n\r\nBut, then, there was the grandiose and ideal figure of Jesus of Nazareth\r\nto be set off against a dark background, to gain in radiance by the\r\ncontrast; _and a darker one the Church could hardly invent_. Lacking the\r\n_Old Testament_ symbology, ignorant of the real connotation of the name of\r\nJehovah—the Rabbinical secret substitute for the Ineffable and\r\nUnpronounceable Name—the Church mistook the cunningly fabricated shadow\r\nfor the reality, the anthropomorphized _generative_ symbol for the one\r\nSecondless Reality, the ever Unknowable Cause of All. As a logical\r\nsequence the Church, for purposes of duality, had to invent an\r\nanthropomorphic Devil—created, as taught by her, by God himself. Satan has\r\nnow turned out to be the monster fabricated by the Jehovah‐\r\nFrankenstein—his father’s curse and a thorn in the divine side, a monster,\r\nthan whom no earthly Frankenstein could have fabricated a more ridiculous\r\nbogey.\r\n\r\nThe author of _New Aspects of Life_ describes the Jewish God very\r\ncorrectly from the kabalistic standpoint as:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Spirit of the Earth, which had revealed itself to the Jew as\r\n    Jehovah.(1175)... It was that Spirit again who, after the death of\r\n    Jesus, assumed his form and personated him as the risen Christ\r\n\r\n\r\n—the doctrine of Cerinthus and several Gnostic sects with slight\r\nvariation, as one can see. But the author’s explanations and deductions\r\nare remarkable:\r\n\r\n\r\n    None knew ... better than Moses, ... [and] so well as he, how\r\n    great was the power of those [Gods of Egypt] with whose priests he\r\n    had contended, ... the gods of which Jehovah is claimed to be the\r\n    God [by the Jews only].\r\n\r\n\r\nAsks the author:\r\n\r\n\r\n    What were these gods, these Achar of which Jehovah, the Achad, is\r\n    claimed to be the God ... by overcoming them?\r\n\r\n\r\nTo which our Occultism answers: Those whom the Church now calls the Fallen\r\nAngels and collectively Satan, the Dragon—overcome, if we have to accept\r\n_her_ dictum, by Michael and his Host, that Michael being simply Jehovah\r\nhimself, one of the subordinate Spirits at best. Therefore, the author is\r\nagain right in saying:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Greeks believed in the existence of ... _daimons_. But ...\r\n    they were anticipated by the Hebrews, who held _that there was a\r\n    class of personating spirits_ which they designated _demons_,\r\n    “personators.”... Admitting with Jehovah, who expressly asserts\r\n    it, the existence of other gods, which ... were personators of the\r\n    One God, were these other gods simply a higher class of\r\n    personating spirits, ... which had acquired and exercised greater\r\n    powers? And is not personation _the key to the mystery of the\r\n    spirit state_? But once granting this position, _how are we to\r\n    know that Jehovah was not a personating spirit_, a spirit which\r\n    arrogated to itself that it was, and thus became, the personator\r\n    of the one unknown and unknowable God? Nay, how do we know that\r\n    the spirit calling itself Jehovah, in arrogating to itself his\r\n    attributes did not thus cause its own designation to be imputed to\r\n    the One who is in reality as nameless as incognizable?(1176)\r\n\r\n\r\nThen the author shows that “the spirit Jehovah _is_ a personator” on its\r\nown admission. It acknowledged to Moses “that it had appeared to the\r\npatriarchs as the God Shaddai” and the “God Helion.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    With the same breath it assumed the name of Jehovah; and it is on\r\n    the faith of the assertion of this personator that the names El,\r\n    Eloah, Elohim, and Shaddai, have been read and interpreted in\r\n    juxtaposition with Jehovah as the “Lord God Almighty.” [Then when]\r\n    the name Jehovah became ineffable, the designation Adonai, “Lord,”\r\n    was substituted for it, and ... it was owing to this substitution\r\n    that the “Lord” passed from the Jewish to the Christian “Word” and\r\n    World as a designation of God.(1177)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd how are we to know, the author may add, that Jehovah was not many\r\nspirits personating even that seemingly one—Jod or Jod‐He?\r\n\r\nBut if the Christian Church was the first to make the existence of Satan a\r\ndogma, it was because, as shown in _Isis Unveiled_, the Devil—the powerful\r\nEnemy of God (?!!) had to become the corner stone and pillar of the\r\nChurch. For, as a Theosophist, M. Jules Baissac, truly observes in his\r\n_Satan ou le Diable_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Il fallait éviter de paraître autoriser le dogme du double\r\n    principe en faisant de ce Satan créateur une puissance réelle, et\r\n    pour expliquer le mal originel, on profère contre Manes\r\n    l’hypothèse d’une permission de l’unique Tout‐Puissant.(1178)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe choice and policy were unfortunate, anyhow. Either the personator of\r\nthe lower God of Abraham and Jacob ought to have been made entirely\r\ndistinct from the mystic “Father” of Jesus, or—the “Fallen” Angels should\r\nhave been left unslandered by further fictions.\r\n\r\nEvery God of the Gentiles is connected with, and closely related to,\r\nJehovah—the Elohim; for they are all One Host, whose units differ only in\r\nname in the Esoteric Teachings. Between the “Obedient” and the “Fallen”\r\nAngels there is no difference whatever, except in their respective\r\nfunctions, or rather in the inertia of some, and the activity of others,\r\namong those Dhyân Chohans, or Elohim, who were “commissioned to create,”\r\n_i.e._, to fabricate the manifested world out of the eternal material.\r\n\r\nThe Kabalists say that the true name of Satan is that of Jehovah turned\r\nupside down, for “Satan is not a black God but the negation of the white\r\nDeity,” or the Light of Truth. God is Light and Satan is the necessary\r\nDarkness or _Shadow_ to set it off, without which pure Light would be\r\ninvisible and incomprehensible.(1179) “For the Initiates,” says Éliphas\r\nLévi, “the Devil is not a person but a creative Force, for Good as for\r\nEvil.” The Initiates represented this Force, which presides at physical\r\ngeneration, under the mysterious form of God Pan—or Nature; whence the\r\nhorns and hoofs of that mythical and symbolic figure, as also the\r\nChristian “goat” of the “Witches’ Sabbath.” With regard to this too,\r\nChristians have imprudently forgotten that the “goat” was also the victim\r\nselected for the atonement of all the sins of Israel, that the scape‐goat\r\nwas indeed the sacrificial martyr, the symbol of the greatest mystery on\r\nearth—the “fall into generation.” Only, the Jews have long forgotten the\r\nreal meaning of their (to the non‐initiated) ridiculous hero, selected\r\nfrom the drama of life in the Great Mysteries enacted by them in the\r\ndesert; and the Christians have never known it.\r\n\r\nÉliphas Lévi seeks to explain the dogma of his Church by paradoxes and\r\nmetaphors, but succeeds very poorly in the face of the many volumes\r\nwritten by pious Roman Catholic Demonologists under the approbation and\r\nauspices of Rome, in this nineteenth century of ours. For the true Roman\r\nCatholic, the Devil or Satan is a _reality_; the drama enacted in the\r\nSidereal Light according to the seer of Patmos—who desired, perhaps, to\r\nimprove upon the narrative in the _Book of Enoch_—is as real, and as\r\nhistorical a fact as any other allegory and symbolical event in the\r\n_Bible_. But the Initiates give an explanation which differs from that\r\ngiven by Éliphas Lévi, whose genius and crafty intellect had to submit to\r\na certain compromise dictated to him from Rome.\r\n\r\nThus, the true and “uncompromising” Kabalists admit that, for all purposes\r\nof Science and Philosophy, it is enough that the profane should know that\r\nthe Great Magic Agent—called by the followers of the Marquis de St.\r\nMartin, the Martinists, the Astral Light, by the mediæval Kabalists and\r\nAlchemists the Sidereal Virgin and the Mysterium Magnum, and by the\r\nEastern Occultists Æther, the reflection of Âkâsha—is that which the\r\nChurch calls Lucifer. That the Latin scholastics have succeeded in\r\ntransforming the Universal Soul and Plerôma—the _Vehicle of Light_ and the\r\nreceptacle of all forms, a Force spread throughout the whole Universe,\r\nwith its direct and indirect effects—into Satan and his works, is no news\r\nto any one. But now they are prepared to give out to the above‐mentioned\r\nprofane even the secrets hinted at by Éliphas Lévi, without _adequate\r\nexplanation_, for the latter’s policy of veiled revelations could only\r\nlead to further superstition and misunderstanding. What, indeed, can a\r\nstudent of Occultism, who is a beginner, gather from the following highly\r\npoetical sentences of Éliphas Lévi, which are as apocalyptic as the\r\nwritings of any of the Alchemists?\r\n\r\n\r\n    Lucifer [the Astral Light] ... is an intermediate force existing\r\n    in all creation; it serves to create and to destroy, and the Fall\r\n    of Adam was an erotic intoxication which has rendered his\r\n    generation a slave to this fatal Light, ... every sexual passion\r\n    that overpowers our senses is a whirlwind of that Light which\r\n    seeks to drag us towards the abyss of death. Madness,\r\n    hallucinations, visions, extasies, are all forms of a very\r\n    dangerous excitation due to this _interior phosphorus_[?]. Thus\r\n    light, finally, is of the nature of fire, the intelligent use of\r\n    which warms and vivifies, and the excess of which, on the\r\n    contrary, dissolves and annihilates.\r\n\r\n    Thus man is called upon to assume a sovereign empire over this\r\n    [Astral] Light and conquer thereby his immortality, and is\r\n    threatened at the same time with being intoxicated, absorbed, and\r\n    eternally destroyed by it.\r\n\r\n    This Light, therefore, inasmuch as it is devouring, revengeful,\r\n    and fatal, would thus really be hell‐fire, the serpent of the\r\n    legend; the tormented errors of which it is full, the tears and\r\n    the gnashing of teeth of the abortive beings it devours, the\r\n    phantom of life that escapes them, and seems to mock and insult\r\n    their agony, all this would be the Devil or Satan indeed.(1180)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no _false_ statement in all this; nothing save a superabundance\r\nof ill‐applied metaphors, as, for instance, in the application of the myth\r\nof Adam to the illustration of the astral effects. Âkâsha,(1181) the\r\nAstral Light, can be defined in a few words; it is the Universal Soul, the\r\nMatrix of the Universe, the Mysterium Magnum from which all that exists is\r\nborn by separation or _differentiation_. It is the cause of existence; it\r\nfills all the infinite Space, _is_ Space itself, in one sense, or both its\r\n_sixth_ and seventh principles.(1182) But as the finite in the Infinite,\r\nas regards manifestation this Light must have its _shadowy_ side—as\r\nalready remarked. And as the Infinite can never be manifested, hence the\r\nfinite world has to be satisfied with the _shadow alone_, which its\r\nactions draw upon humanity and which men attract and _force into __\r\nactivity_. Hence, while the Astral Light is the Universal Cause in its\r\nunmanifested unity and infinity, it becomes, with regard to mankind,\r\nsimply the effects of the causes produced by men in their sinful lives. It\r\nis not its bright denizens—whether they are called Spirits of Light or\r\nDarkness—that produce Good or Evil, but mankind itself that determines the\r\nunavoidable action and reaction in the Great Magic Agent. It is mankind\r\nwhich has become the “Serpent of Genesis,” and thus causes daily and\r\nhourly the Fall and Sin of the “Celestial Virgin”—which thus becomes the\r\nMother of Gods and Devils at one and the same time; for she is the ever‐\r\nloving, beneficent Deity to all those who stir her _Soul_ and _Heart_,\r\ninstead of attracting to themselves her shadowy manifested essence, called\r\nby Éliphas Lévi—the “fatal light” which kills and destroys. Humanity, in\r\nits units, can overpower and master its effects; but only by the holiness\r\nof their lives and by producing good causes. It has power only on the\r\nmanifested _lower_ principles—the shadow of the Unknown and Incognizable\r\nDeity in Space. But in antiquity and _reality_, Lucifer, or Luciferus, is\r\nthe name of the Angelic Entity presiding over the Light of Truth as over\r\nthe light of the day. In the great Valentinian Gospel _Pistis Sophia_ it\r\nis taught that of the three Powers emanating from the Holy Names of the\r\nthree Triple Powers (Τριδυνάμεις), that of Sophia (the Holy Ghost\r\naccording to these Gnostics—the most cultured of all), resides in the\r\nplanet Venus or Lucifer.\r\n\r\nThus to the profane, the Astral Light may be God and Devil at once—_Demon\r\nest Deus inversus_—that is to say, through every point of Infinite Space\r\nthrill the magnetic and electrical currents of _animate_ Nature, the life‐\r\ngiving and death‐giving waves, for death on earth becomes life on another\r\nplane. Lucifer is divine and terrestrial Light, the “Holy Ghost” and\r\n“Satan,” at one and the same time, _visible_ Space being truly filled with\r\nthe differentiated Breath invisibly; and the Astral Light, the manifested\r\neffects of the two who are one, guided and attracted by ourselves, is the\r\n_Karma_ of Humanity, both a personal and impersonal entity—personal,\r\nbecause it is the mystic name given by St. Martin to the Host of Divine\r\nCreators, Guides and Rulers of this Planet; _impersonal_, as the Cause and\r\nEffect of Universal Life and Death.\r\n\r\nThe Fall was the _result of man’s knowledge_, for his “eyes were opened.”\r\nIndeed, he was taught Wisdom and the Hidden Knowledge by the “Fallen\r\nAngel,” for the latter had become from that day his Manas, Mind and Self‐\r\nconsciousness. In each of us that golden thread of continuous\r\nLife—periodically broken into active and passive cycles of sensuous\r\nexistence on Earth, and super‐sensuous in Devachan—_is_ from the beginning\r\nof our appearance upon this Earth. It is the Sûtrâtmâ, the luminous thread\r\nof immortal _impersonal_ Monadship, on which our earthly “lives” or\r\nevanescent Egos are strung as so many beads—according to the beautiful\r\nexpression of the Vedântic Philosophy.\r\n\r\nAnd now it stands proven that Satan, or the Red Fiery Dragon, the “Lord of\r\nPhôsphoros”—brimstone was a Theological improvement—and Lucifer, or\r\n“Light‐Bearer,” is in us: it is our Mind, our Tempter and Redeemer, our\r\nintelligent Liberator and Saviour from pure animalism. Without this\r\nprinciple—the emanation of the very essence of the pure divine principle\r\nMahat (Intelligence), which radiates direct from the Divine Mind—we would\r\nbe surely no better than animals. The first _man_ Adam was made only a\r\n_living soul_ (Nephesh), the last Adam was made a _quickening\r\nspirit_(1183)—says Paul, his words referring to the building or _creation_\r\nof man. Without this _quickening_ spirit, or _human mind_ or soul, there\r\nwould be no difference between man and beast; as there is none, in fact,\r\nbetween animals with respect to their actions. The tiger and the donkey,\r\nthe hawk and the dove, are each one as pure and as innocent as the other,\r\nbecause _irresponsible_. Each follows its instinct, the tiger and the hawk\r\nkilling with the same unconcern as the donkey eats a thistle, or the dove\r\npecks at a grain of corn. If the Fall had the significance given to it by\r\nTheology; if that Fall occurred as a result of an act never intended by\r\nNature—a _sin_, how about the animals? If we are told that they procreate\r\ntheir species in consequence of that same “original sin,” for which God\r\ncursed the Earth—hence everything living on it—we will put another\r\nquestion. We are told by Theology, as also by Science, that the animal was\r\non Earth far earlier than man. We ask the former: How did it _procreate\r\nits species_, before the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil\r\nhad been plucked off? As said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Christians—far less clear‐sighted than the great Mystic and\r\n    Liberator whose name they have assumed, whose doctrines they have\r\n    misunderstood and travestied, _and whose memory they have\r\n    blackened by their deeds_—took the Jewish Jehovah as he was, and\r\n    of course strove vainly to reconcile the _Gospel of Light and\r\n    Liberty_ with the Deity of Darkness and Submission.(1184)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it is sufficiently proven now that all the _soi‐disant_ evil Spirits\r\nwho are credited with having made war on the Gods, are identical as\r\npersonalities; that, moreover, all the ancient religions taught the same\r\ntenet, save the final conclusion, which differs from the Christian. The\r\nseven primeval Gods had all a dual state, one essential, the other\r\naccidental. In their essential state they were all the Builders or\r\nFashioners, the Preservers and the Rulers of this World; and in the\r\naccidental state, clothing themselves in visible corporeality, they\r\ndescended on the Earth and reigned on it as Kings and Instructors of the\r\nlower Hosts, who had incarnated once more upon it as men.\r\n\r\nThus, Esoteric Philosophy shows that man is truly the manifested deity in\r\nboth its aspects—good and evil, but Theology cannot admit this\r\nphilosophical truth. Teaching as it does the dogma of the Fallen Angels in\r\nits dead‐letter meaning, and having made of Satan the corner‐stone and\r\npillar of the dogma of redemption—to do so would be suicidal. Having once\r\nshown the rebellious Angels _distinct_ from God and the Logos in their\r\npersonalities, to admit that the downfall of the _disobedient_ Spirits\r\nmeans simply their fall into generation and matter, would be equivalent to\r\nsaying that God and Satan were identical. For since the Logos, or God, is\r\nthe aggregate of that once divine Host accused of having fallen, it would\r\nnaturally follow that the Logos and Satan are one.\r\n\r\nYet such was the real philosophical view in antiquity of the now\r\ndisfigured tenet. The Verbum, or the “Son,” was shown in a dual aspect by\r\nthe Pagan Gnostics—in fact, he was a _duality_ in full _unity_. Hence, the\r\nendless and various national versions. The Greeks had Jupiter, the son of\r\nCronus, the Father, who hurls him down into the depths of Kosmos. The\r\nÂryans had Brahmâ (in later theology) precipitated by Shiva into the Abyss\r\nof Darkness, etc. But the Fall of all these Logoi and Demiourgoi from\r\ntheir primitive exalted position, contained in all cases one and the same\r\nEsoteric signification; the Curse, in its philosophical meaning, of being\r\nincarnated on this Earth; an unavoidable rung in the Ladder of Cosmic\r\nEvolution, a highly philosophical and fitting Karmic Law, without which\r\nthe presence of Evil on Earth would have to remain for ever a closed\r\nmystery to the understanding of true Philosophy. To say, as the author of\r\n_Esprits Tombés des Paiens_ does, that since—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Christianity is made to rest on two pillars, that of evil\r\n    (πουηροῦ), and of good (ἀγαθοῦ); on two forces, in short (ἀγαθαὶ\r\n    καὶ κακαὶ δυνάμεις): hence, if we suppress the punishment of the\r\n    _evil forces_, the protecting mission of the good powers will have\r\n    neither value nor sense\r\n\r\n\r\n—is to utter the most unphilosophical absurdity. If it fits in with, and\r\nexplains, Christian dogma, it obscures the facts and truths of the\r\nprimitive Wisdom of the ages. The cautious hints of Paul have all the true\r\nEsoteric meaning, and it took centuries of scholastic casuistry to give\r\nthem the false colouring in their present interpretations. The Verbum and\r\nLucifer are one in their dual aspect; and the “Prince of the Air”\r\n(_princeps aeris hujus_) is not the “God of _that_ period,” but an\r\neverlasting principle. When the latter was said to be ever _circling_\r\naround the world (_qui circumambulat terram_), the great Apostle referred\r\nsimply to the never‐ceasing cycles of human incarnations, in which evil\r\nwill ever predominate unto the day when Humanity is redeemed by the true\r\ndivine Enlightenment which gives the correct perception of things.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to disfigure vague expressions written in dead and long‐\r\nforgotten languages, and palm them off on the ignorant masses as truths\r\nand _revealed_ facts. The identity of thought and meaning is the one thing\r\nthat strikes the student in all the religions which mention the tradition\r\nof the Fallen Spirits, and in those great religions there is not one that\r\nfails to mention and describe it in one or another form. Thus, Hoang‐ty,\r\nthe Great Spirit, sees his Sons, who had acquired _active wisdom_, falling\r\ninto the Valley of Pain. Their leader, the Flying Dragon, having drunk of\r\nthe forbidden Ambrosia, _fell to the Earth_ with his Host (Kings). In the\r\n_Zend Avesta_, Angra Mainyu (Ahriman), surrounding himself with Fire (the\r\n“Flames” of the Stanzas), seeks to conquer the Heavens,(1185) when Ahura\r\nMazda, descending from the _solid_ Heaven he inhabits, to the help of the\r\nHeavens _that revolve_ (in time and space, the manifested worlds of cycles\r\nincluding those of incarnation), and the Amshaspands, the “seven bright\r\nSravah,” accompanied by their stars, fight Ahriman, and the vanquished\r\nDevas fall to the Earth along with him.(1186) In the _Vendîdâd_ the Daêvas\r\nare called “evil‐doing,” and are shown to rush away “into the depths of\r\nthe ... world of hell,” or Matter.(1187) This is an allegory which shows\r\nthe Devas _compelled to incarnate_, once that they have separated\r\nthemselves from their Parent Essence, or, in other words, after the Unit\r\nhad become multiple, after differentiation and manifestation.\r\n\r\nTyphon the Egyptian Python, the Titans, the Suras and the Asuras, all\r\nbelong to the same legend of Spirits peopling the Earth. They are not\r\n“_Demons_ commissioned to create and organize this visible universe,” but\r\nthe Fashioners or “Architects” of the Worlds, and the Progenitors of Man.\r\nThey are the _Fallen_ Angels, metaphorically—the “true mirrors” of the\r\n“Eternal Wisdom.”\r\n\r\nWhat is the complete truth as well as the Esoteric meaning about this\r\nuniversal myth? The whole essence of truth _cannot be transmitted from\r\nmouth to ear_. Nor can any pen describe it, not even that of the Recording\r\nAngel, unless man finds the answer in the sanctuary of his own heart, in\r\nthe innermost depths of his divine intuition. It is the great _Seventh\r\nMystery_ of Creation, the first and the last; and those who read St.\r\nJohn’s _Apocalypse_ may find its shadow lurking under the _seventh seal_.\r\nIt can be represented only in its apparent, objective form, like the\r\neternal riddle of the Sphinx. If the Sphinx threw herself into the sea and\r\nperished, it is not because Œdipus _had_ unriddled the secret of the ages,\r\nbut because, by anthropomorphizing the ever‐spiritual and the subjective,\r\nhe had dishonoured the great truth for ever. Therefore, we can give it\r\nonly from its philosophical and intellectual planes, unlocked with three\r\nkeys respectively—for the last four keys of the seven that throw wide open\r\nthe portals to the Mysteries of Nature are in the hands of the highest\r\nInitiates, and cannot be divulged to the masses at large—not in this\r\ncentury, at any rate.\r\n\r\nThe dead‐letter is everywhere the same. The dualism in the Mazdean\r\nreligion was born from exoteric interpretation. The holy Airyaman, the\r\n“bestower of weal,”(1188) invoked in the prayer called Airyama‐ishyô, is\r\nthe divine aspect of Ahriman, “the deadly, the Daêva of the Daêvas,”(1189)\r\nand Angra Mainyu is the dark material aspect of the former. “Keep us from\r\nour hater, O Mazda and Ârmaita Spenta,”(1190) has, as a prayer and\r\ninvocation, an identical meaning with “Lead us not into temptation,” and\r\nis addressed by man to the terrible _spirit of duality_ in man himself.\r\nFor Ahura Mazda is the Spiritual, Divine, and Purified Man, and Ârmaita\r\nSpenta, the Spirit of the Earth or materiality, is the same as Ahriman or\r\nAngra Mainyu in one sense.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the Magian or Mazdean literature—or what remains of it—is\r\nmagical, occult, hence allegorical and symbolical, even its “mystery of\r\nthe law.”(1191) Now the Mobed and the Parsî keep their eye on the Baresma\r\nduring the sacrifice—the divine twig off Ormazd’s “Tree” having been\r\ntransformed into a bunch of metallic rods—and wonder why neither the\r\nAmesha Spentas, nor “the high and beautiful golden Haômas, nor even their\r\nVohu‐Manô (good thoughts), nor their Râta (sacrificial offering),” help\r\nthem much. Let them meditate on the “Tree of Wisdom,” and by study\r\nassimilate, one by one, the fruits thereof. The way to the Tree of Eternal\r\nLife, the white Haôma, the Gaokerena, is through one end of the Earth to\r\nthe other; and Haôma is in Heaven as it is on Earth. But to become once\r\nmore a priest of it, and a “healer,” man must heal himself, for this must\r\nbe done before he can heal others.\r\n\r\nThis proves once more that, in order to be dealt with, with at least an\r\napproximate degree of justice, the so‐called “myths” have to be closely\r\nexamined from all their aspects. In truth, every one of the seven keys has\r\nto be used in its right place, and never mixed with the others—if we would\r\nunveil the entire cycle of mysteries. In our day of dreary soul‐killing\r\nMaterialism, the ancient Priest‐Initiates have become, in the opinion of\r\nour learned generations, the synonyms of clever impostors, kindling the\r\nfires of superstition in order to obtain an easier sway over the minds of\r\nmen. This is an unfounded calumny, generated by scepticism and\r\nuncharitable thoughts. No one believed more than they did in Gods—or, we\r\nmay call them, the spiritual and now invisible Powers, or Spirits, the\r\nNoumena of the phenomena; and they believed simply because _they knew_.\r\nAnd though after being initiated into the Mysteries of Nature, they were\r\nforced to withhold their knowledge from the profane, who would have surely\r\nabused it, such secrecy was undeniably less dangerous than the policy of\r\ntheir usurpers and successors. The former taught only that which they well\r\nknew. The latter, teaching what _they do not know_, have invented, as a\r\nsecure haven for their ignorance, a jealous and cruel Deity, who forbids\r\nman to pry into his mysteries under the penalty of damnation; as well they\r\nmay, for _his_ mysteries can at best be only hinted at in polite ears,\r\nnever described. Turn to King’s _Gnostics and their Remains_, and see for\r\nyourself what was the primitive Ark of the Covenant, according to the\r\nauthor, who says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    There is a Rabbinical tradition ... that the Cherubim placed over\r\n    it were represented as male and female, in the act of copulation,\r\n    in order to express the grand doctrine of the Essence of _Form_\r\n    and _Matter_, the two principles of all things. When the Chaldeans\r\n    broke into the Sanctuary and beheld this most astounding emblem,\r\n    they naturally enough exclaimed, “Is this your God, of whom you\r\n    boast, that He is such a lover of purity!”(1192)\r\n\r\n\r\nKing thinks that this tradition “savours too much of Alexandrian\r\nphilosophy to demand any credit,” to which we demur. The shape and form of\r\nthe wings of the two Cherubim standing on the right and left sides of the\r\nArk, these wings meeting over the “Holy of Holies,” are an _emblem_ quite\r\neloquent in itself, not to speak of the “holy” Jod within the Ark! The\r\nMystery of Agathodæmon, whose legend states, “I am Chnumis, Sun of the\r\nUniverse, 700,” can alone solve the mystery of Jesus, the number of whose\r\nname is “888.” It is not the key of St. Peter, or the Church dogma, but\r\nthe Narthex—the Wand of the Candidate for Initiation—that has to be\r\nwrenched from the grasp of the long‐silent Sphinx of the ages. Meanwhile:\r\n\r\nThe augurs, who, upon meeting each other, have to thrust their tongues\r\ninto their cheeks to suppress a fit of laughter, may be more numerous in\r\nour own age than they ever were in the day of Sylla.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection VI. Prometheus, the Titan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHis Origin In Ancient India.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our modern day there is not the slightest doubt in the minds of the\r\nbest European symbologists that the name Prometheus possessed the greatest\r\nand most mysterious significance in antiquity. While giving the history of\r\nDeucalion, whom the Bœotians regarded as the ancestor of the human races,\r\nand who was the son of Prometheus, according to the significant legend,\r\nthe author of the _Mythologie de la Grèce Antique_ remarks:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Thus Prometheus is something more than the archetype of humanity;\r\n    he is its _generator_. In the same way that we saw Hephæstus\r\n    moulding the first woman [Pandora] and endowing her with life, so\r\n    Prometheus kneads the moist clay, of which he fashions the body of\r\n    the first man whom he will endow with the soul‐spark.(1193) After\r\n    the flood of Deucalion, Zeus, they said, had commanded Prometheus\r\n    and Athena to call forth a new race of men from the mire left by\r\n    the waters of the deluge,(1194) and, in the day of Pausanias, the\r\n    slime which the hero had used for this purpose was still shown in\r\n    Phocis.(1195) On several archaic monuments we still see Prometheus\r\n    modelling a human body, either alone or with Athena’s help.(1196)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same author reminds us of another equally mysterious personage, though\r\none less generally known than Prometheus, whose legend offers remarkable\r\nanalogies with that of the Titan. The name of this second ancestor and\r\ngenerator is Phoroneus, the hero of an ancient poem, now unfortunately no\r\nlonger extant, the Phoroneidæ. His legend was localized in Argolis, where\r\na perpetual flame was preserved on his altar as a reminder that he was the\r\nbringer of fire upon earth.(1197) A benefactor of men, like Prometheus, he\r\nhad made them participators of every bliss on earth. Plato(1198) and\r\nClemens Alexandrinus(1199) say that Phoroneus was the first man, or the\r\n“father of mortals.” His genealogy, which assigns to him the river Inachos\r\nas his father, reminds us of that of Prometheus, which makes that Titan\r\nthe son of the Oceanid Clymene. But the mother of Phoroneus was the nymph\r\nMelia: a significant descent which distinguishes him from\r\nPrometheus.(1200)\r\n\r\nMelia, Decharme thinks, is the personification of the “Ash‐tree,” whence,\r\naccording to Hesiod, issued the race of the age of Bronze,(1201) and which\r\nwith the Greeks is the _celestial tree_ common to every Âryan mythology.\r\nThis Ash is the Yggdrasil of Norse antiquity, which the Norns sprinkle\r\ndaily with the waters from the fountain of Urd, that it may not wither. It\r\nremains verdant till the last days of the Golden Age. Then the Norns—the\r\nthree sisters who gaze respectively into the Past, the Present, and the\r\nFuture—make known the decree of Orlog or Fate (Karma), but men are\r\nconscious only of the Present.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [But when] Gultweig (gold‐ore) comes, the bewitching enchantress\r\n    ... who, thrice cast into the fire, arises each time more\r\n    beautiful than before and fills the souls of gods and men with\r\n    unappeasable longing, then the Norns ... enter into being, and the\r\n    blessed peace of childhood’s dreams passes away, and sin comes\r\n    into existence with all its evil consequences [and Karma].(1202)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thrice‐purified Gold is—Manas, the Conscious Soul.\r\n\r\nWith the Greeks, the Ash‐tree represented the same idea. Its luxuriant\r\nboughs are the Sidereal Heaven, golden by day and studded with stars by\r\nnight—the fruits of Melia and Yggdrasil, under whose protecting shadow\r\nhumanity lived during the Golden Age without desire as without fear. “That\r\ntree had a fruit, or an inflamed bough, _which was lightning_”—Decharme\r\nguesses.\r\n\r\nAnd here steps in the killing Materialism of the age, that peculiar twist\r\nin the modern mind, which, like a Northern blast, bends all on its way,\r\nand freezes every intuition, allowing it no hand in the physical\r\nspeculations of the day. After having seen in Prometheus no more than\r\n“fire by friction,” the learned author of the _Mythologie de la Grèce\r\nAntique_ perceives in this “fruit” a trifle more than an allusion to\r\nterrestrial fire and its discovery. It is no longer fire, owing to the\r\nfall of lightning setting some dry fuel in a blaze, and thus revealing all\r\nits priceless benefits to palæolithic men—but something more mysterious\r\nthis time, though still as earthly!\r\n\r\n\r\n    A divine bird, nestled in the branches [of the celestial Ash‐\r\n    tree], stole that bough [or the fruit] and carried it down on the\r\n    earth in its bill. Now the Greek word Φορώνευς is the rigid\r\n    equivalent of the Sanskrit word _bhuranyu_, “the rapid,” an\r\n    epithet of Agni, considered as the carrier of the divine spark.\r\n    Phoroneus, son of Melia or of the celestial ash, thus corresponds\r\n    to a conception far more ancient, probably, than that one which\r\n    transformed the _pramantha_ [of the old Âryan Hindûs] into the\r\n    Greek Prometheus. Phoroneus is the [personified] bird, that brings\r\n    the heavenly lightning to the earth. Traditions relating to the\r\n    birth of the race of Bronze, and those which made of Phoroneus the\r\n    father of the Argolians, are an evidence to us that this\r\n    thunderbolt [or lightning], as in the legend of Hephæstus or\r\n    Prometheus, was the origin of the human race.(1203)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis still affords us no more than the external meaning of the symbols and\r\nthe allegory. It is now supposed that the name of Prometheus has been\r\nunriddled. But the modern Mythologists and Orientalists see in it no\r\nlonger what their fathers saw on the authority of the whole of classical\r\nantiquity. They only find therein something far more appropriate to the\r\nspirit of the age, namely, a phallic element. But the name of Phoroneus,\r\nas well as that of Prometheus, bears not one, nor even two, but a series\r\nof esoteric meanings. Both relate to the _seven_ Celestial Fires; to Agni\r\nAbhimânin, his three sons, and their forty‐five sons, constituting the\r\nForty‐nine Fires. Do all these numbers relate only to the terrestrial mode\r\nof fire and to the flame of sexual passion? Did the Hindû Âryan mind never\r\nsoar above such purely sensual conceptions; that mind which is declared by\r\nProf. Max Müller to be the most spiritual and mystically inclined on the\r\nwhole globe? The number of those fires alone ought to have suggested an\r\ninkling of the truth.\r\n\r\nWe are told that one is no longer permitted, in this age of rational\r\nthought, to explain the name of Pro‐metheus as the old Greeks did. The\r\nlatter, it seems:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Basing themselves on the apparent analogy of προμηθεύς with the\r\n    verb προμανθύνειν, saw in him the type of the “foreseeing” man, to\r\n    whom, for the sake of symmetry, a brother was added—Epi‐metheus,\r\n    or “he who takes counsel _after_ the event.”(1204)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut now the Orientalists have decided otherwise. They know the real\r\nmeaning of the two names better than those who invented them. The legend\r\nis based upon an event of universal importance. It was built to\r\ncommemorate\r\n\r\n\r\n    A great event which must have strongly impressed itself upon the\r\n    imagination of the first witnesses, and its remembrance has never\r\n    since faded out from popular memory.(1205)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was this? Laying aside every poetical _fiction_, all those dreams of\r\nthe Golden Age, let us imagine—argue the modern scholars—in all its gross\r\nrealism, the first miserable state of humanity, the striking picture of\r\nwhich was traced for us after Æschylus by Lucretius, and the exact truth\r\nof which is now confirmed by Science; and then we may understand better\r\nthat a new life really began for man, on that day when he saw the first\r\nspark produced by the friction of two pieces of wood, or from the veins of\r\na flint. How could men help feeling gratitude to that mysterious and\r\nmarvellous being which they were henceforth enabled to create at their\r\nwill, and which was no sooner born, than it grew and expanded, developing\r\nwith singular power.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This terrestrial flame, was it not analogous in nature to that\r\n    which sent them from above its light and heat, or which frightened\r\n    them in the thunderbolt? Was it not derived from the same source?\r\n    And if its origin was in heaven, must it not have been brought\r\n    down some day on earth? If so, who was the powerful being, the\r\n    beneficent being, God or man, who had conquered it? Such are the\r\n    questions which the curiosity of the Âryans offered in the early\r\n    days of their existence, and which found their answer in the myth\r\n    of Prometheus.(1206)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Philosophy of Occult Science finds two weak points in the above\r\nreflections, and proceeds to point them out. The miserable state of\r\nHumanity described by Æschylus and Lucretius was no more wretched then, in\r\nthe early days of the Âryans, than it is now. That “state” was limited to\r\nthe savage tribes; and the now‐existing savages are not a whit more happy\r\nor unhappy than their forefathers were a million years ago.\r\n\r\nIt is an accepted fact in Science that “rude implements, exactly\r\nresembling those in use _among existing savages_,” are found in river‐\r\ngravels and caves, geologically “implying an enormous antiquity.” So great\r\nis that resemblance that, as the author of _The Modern Zoroastrian_ tells\r\nus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    If the collection in the Colonial Exhibition of stone celts and\r\n    arrow‐heads used by the Bushmen of South Africa were placed side\r\n    by side with one from the British Museum of similar objects from\r\n    Kent’s Cavern or the Caves of Dordogne, no one but an expert could\r\n    distinguish between them.(1207)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd if there are Bushmen existing now, in our age of the highest\r\ncivilization, who are no higher intellectually than the race of men which\r\ninhabited Devonshire and Southern France during the Palæolithic age, why\r\ncould not the latter have lived simultaneously with, and have been the\r\ncontemporary of, other races as highly civilized for their day as we are\r\nfor ours? That the sum of knowledge increases daily in mankind, “but that\r\nintellectual capacity does not increase with it,” is shown when the\r\nintellect, if not the physical knowledge, of the Euclids, Pythagorases,\r\nPâninis, Kapilas, Platos, and Socrates, is compared with that of the\r\nNewtons, Kants, and the modern Huxleys and Hæckels. On comparing the\r\nresults obtained by Dr. J. Barnard Davis, the Craniologist,(1208) with\r\nregard to the internal capacity of the skull—its volume being taken as the\r\nstandard and test for judging of the intellectual capacities—Dr. Pfaff\r\nfinds that this capacity among the French (certainly in the highest rank\r\nof mankind) is 88.4 cubic inches, being thus “perceptibly smaller than\r\nthat of the Polynesians generally, which, even among many Papuans and\r\nAlfuras of the lowest grade, amounts to 89 and 89.7 cubic inches”; which\r\nshows that it is the _quality_ and not the _quantity_ of the brain that is\r\nthe cause of intellectual capacity. The average index of skulls among\r\nvarious races having been now recognized to be “one of the most\r\ncharacteristic marks of difference between different races,” the following\r\ncomparison is suggestive:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The index of breadth among the Scandinavians [is] at 75; among the\r\n    English at 76; among Holsteiners at 77; in Bresgau at 80;\r\n    Schiller’s skull shows an index of breadth even of 82 ... the\r\n    Madurese also 82!\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, the same comparison between the oldest skulls known and the\r\nEuropean, brings to light the startling fact that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Most of these old skulls, belonging to the stone period, are\r\n    above rather than below the average of the brain of the now living\r\n    man in volume._\r\n\r\n\r\nCalculating the measures for the height, breadth, and length in inches\r\nfrom the average measurements of several skulls, the following sums are\r\nobtained:\r\n\r\n1. Old Northern skulls of the stone age:                    18.877 ins.\r\n2. Average of 48 skulls of the same period from England:    18.858 ins.\r\n3. Average of 7 skulls of the same period from Wales:       18.649 ins.\r\n4. Average of 36 skulls of the stone age from France:       18.220 ins.\r\n\r\nThe average of the now living Europeans is 18.579 inches; of Hottentots,\r\n17.795 inches!\r\n\r\nThese figures show plainly that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The size of the brain of the oldest populations known to us is not\r\n    such as to place them on a lower level than that of the now living\r\n    inhabitants of the Earth.(1209)\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides which, they show the “missing link” vanishing into thin air. Of\r\nthese, however, more anon: we must return to our direct subject.\r\n\r\nAs the “Prometheus Vinctus” of Æschylus tells us, the race which Jupiter\r\nso ardently desired “to quench, and plant a new one in its stead” (v.\r\n241), suffered _mental_, not physical misery. The first boon Prometheus\r\ngave to mortals, as he tells the Chorus, was to hinder them “from\r\n_foreseeing_ death” (v. 256); he “saved the mortal race from sinking\r\nblasted down to Hades’ gloom” (v. 244); and then only, “besides” that, he\r\ngave them fire (v. 260). This shows plainly the dual character at any rate\r\nof the Promethean myth, if Orientalists will not accept the existence of\r\nthe _seven keys_ taught in Occultism. This relates to the first opening of\r\nman’s spiritual perceptions, not to his first seeing or “discovering”\r\nfire. For fire was never _discovered_, but existed on Earth since its\r\nbeginning. It existed in the seismic activity of the early ages, volcanic\r\neruptions being as frequent and constant in those periods as fog is in\r\nEngland now. And if we are told that men appeared so late on Earth that\r\nall but a few volcanoes were already extinct, and that geological\r\ndisturbances had made room for a more settled state of things, we answer:\r\nLet a new race of men—whether evolved from Angel or Gorilla—appear now on\r\nany uninhabited spot of the Globe, with the exception perhaps of the\r\nSahara, and a thousand to one it would not be a year or two old before\r\n“discovering fire,” through lightning setting the grass or something else\r\nin flames. This assumption, that primitive man lived ages on Earth before\r\nhe was made acquainted with fire, is one of the most painfully illogical\r\nof all. But old Æschylus was an Initiate, and knew well what he was giving\r\nout.(1210)\r\n\r\nNo Occultist acquainted with symbology and the fact that Wisdom came to us\r\nfrom the East, will for a moment deny that the myth of Prometheus has\r\nreached Europe from Âryâvarta. Nor is he likely to deny that in one sense\r\nPrometheus represents “fire by friction.” Therefore, he admires the\r\nsagacity of M. F. Baudry, who shows in “Les Mythes du Feu et du Breuvage\r\nCéleste”(1211) one of the aspects of Prometheus and his origin from India.\r\nHe shows the reader the _supposed_ primitive process to obtain fire, still\r\nin use to‐day in India to light the sacrificial flame. This is what he\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\r\n    This process, such as it is minutely described in the Vedic\r\n    Sûtras, consists in rapidly turning a stick in a socket made in\r\n    the centre of a piece of wood. The friction develops intense heat\r\n    and ends by setting on fire the particles of wood in contact. The\r\n    motion of the stick is not a continuous rotation, but a series of\r\n    motions in contrary senses, by means of a cord fixed to the stick\r\n    in its middle; the operator holds one of the ends in each hand and\r\n    pulls them alternately.... The full process is designated in\r\n    Sanskrit by the verb _manthâmi, mathnáni_, which means “to rub,\r\n    agitate, shake and obtain by rubbing,” and is especially applied\r\n    to rotatory friction, as is proved by its derivative _mandala_,\r\n    which signifies a circle.... The pieces of wood serving for the\r\n    production of fire have each their name in Sanskrit. The stick\r\n    which turns is called _pramantha_; the discus which receives it is\r\n    called _arani_ and _aranî_: “the two aranis” designating the\r\n    _ensemble_ of the instrument.(1212)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt remains to be seen what the Brâhmans will say to this. But even\r\nsupposing that Prometheus, in one of the aspects of his myth, was\r\nconceived as the producer of fire by means of the Pramantha, or as an\r\nanimate and divine Pramantha, would this imply that the symbolism had no\r\nother than the phallic meaning attributed to it by modern symbologists?\r\nDecharme, at any rate, seems to have a correct glimmering of the truth;\r\nfor he unconsciously corroborates all that the Occult Sciences teach with\r\nregard to the Mânasa Devas, who have endowed man with the consciousness of\r\nhis immortal soul—that consciousness which hinders man “from foreseeing\r\ndeath,” and makes him _know_ he is immortal.(1213) “How did Prometheus\r\ncome into possession of the [divine] spark?” he asks.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Fire having its abode in heaven, it is there he must have gone to\r\n    find it before he could carry it down to men, and, to approach the\r\n    gods, he must have been a god himself.(1214)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Greeks held that he was of the _Divine_ Race, “the son of the Titan\r\nIapetos”;(1215) the Hindûs, that he was a Deva.\r\n\r\n\r\n    But celestial fire belonged in the beginning to the gods alone; it\r\n    was a treasure they reserved for themselves ... over which they\r\n    jealously watched.... “The prudent son of Iapetus,” says Hesiod,\r\n    “deceived Jupiter by stealing and concealing in the cavity of a\r\n    narthex, the indefatigable fire of the resplendent glow.”(1216)\r\n    ... Thus the gift made by Prometheus to men was a conquest made\r\n    from heaven. Now according to Greek ideas [in this identical with\r\n    those of the Occultists], this possession forced from Jupiter,\r\n    this human trespassing upon the property of the gods, had to be\r\n    followed by an expiation.... Prometheus, moreover, belongs to that\r\n    race of Titans who had rebelled(1217) against the gods, and whom\r\n    the master of Olympus had hurled down into Tartarus; like them, he\r\n    is the genius of evil, doomed to cruel suffering.(1218)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is most revolting in the explanations that follow, is the one‐sided\r\nview taken of this grandest of all myths. The most intuitional among\r\nmodern writers cannot, or will not, rise in their conceptions above the\r\nlevel of the Earth and cosmic phenomena. It is not denied that the moral\r\nidea in the myth, as presented in the _Theogony_ of Hesiod, plays a\r\ncertain part in the primitive Greek conception. The Titan is more than a\r\nthief of the celestial fire. He is the representation of humanity—active,\r\nindustrious, intelligent, but at the same time ambitious, which aims at\r\nequalling divine powers. Therefore it is humanity punished in the person\r\nof Prometheus, but it is only so with the Greeks. With them, Prometheus is\r\nnot a criminal, save in the eyes of the Gods. In his relation with the\r\nEarth, he is, on the contrary, a God himself, a friend of mankind\r\n(φιλάνθρωπος), which he has raised to civilization and initiated into the\r\nknowledge of all the arts; a conception which found its most poetical\r\nexpounder in Æschylus. But with all other nations Prometheus is—what? The\r\nFallen Angel, Satan, as the Church would have it? Not at all. _He is\r\nsimply the image of the pernicious and dreaded effects of lightning._ He\r\nis the “evil fire” (_mal feu_)(1219) _and the symbol of the divine\r\nreproductive male organ_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Reduced to its simple expression, the myth we are trying to\r\n    explain is then simply a [cosmic] genius of fire.(1220)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the former idea (the phallic) which was _preëminently_ Âryan, if we\r\nbelieve Adalbert Kuhn(1221) and F. Baudry. For:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The fire used by man being the result of the action of _pramantha_\r\n    in the _arani_, the Âryas _must have_ ascribed [?] the same origin\r\n    to celestial fire, and they _must have_(1222) imagined [?] that a\r\n    god armed with the pramantha, or a divine pramantha, caused a\r\n    violent friction in the bosom of the clouds, which gave birth to\r\n    lightning and thunderbolts.(1223)\r\n\r\n    This idea is supported by the fact that, according to Plutarch’s\r\n    testimony,(1224) the Stoics thought that thunder was the result of\r\n    the struggle of storm‐clouds, and lightning a conflagration due to\r\n    friction; while Aristotle saw in the thunderbolt only the action\r\n    of clouds which clashed with each other. What was this theory, if\r\n    not the scientific translation of the production of fire by\r\n    friction?... Everything leads us to think that, from the highest\r\n    antiquity, and before the dispersion of the Âryas, it was believed\r\n    that the pramantha lighted the fire in the storm‐cloud as well as\r\n    in the aranis.(1225)\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, suppositions and idle hypotheses are made to stand for discovered\r\ntruths. Defenders of the biblical dead‐letter could not help the writers\r\nof missionary tracts more effectually than do materialistic Symbologists\r\nin thus taking for granted that the ancient Âryans based their religious\r\nconceptions on no higher thought than the physiological.\r\n\r\nBut it is not so, and the very spirit of Vedic Philosophy is against such\r\nan interpretation. For if, as Decharme himself confesses:\r\n\r\n\r\n    This idea of the creative power of fire is explained ... by the\r\n    ancient assimilation of the human soul to a celestial spark(1226)\r\n\r\n\r\n—as shown by the imagery often made use of in the _Vedas_ when speaking of\r\nArani, it would mean something higher than simply a gross sexual\r\nconception. A Hymn to Agni in the _Veda_ is cited as an example:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Here is the pramantha; the generator is ready. Bring the mistress\r\n    of the race (the female aranî). Let us produce Agni by attrition,\r\n    according to ancient custom.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis means no worse than an abstract idea expressed in the tongue of\r\nmortals. The female Aranî, the “mistress of the race,” is Aditi, the\r\nMother of the Gods, or Shekinah, Eternal Light—in the World of Spirit, the\r\n“Great Deep” and Chaos; or Primordial Substance in its first remove from\r\nthe Unknown, in the Manifested Kosmos. If, ages later, the same epithet is\r\napplied to Devakî, the Mother of Krishna, or the incarnated Logos; and if\r\nthe symbol, owing to the gradual and irrepressible spread of exoteric\r\nreligions, may now be regarded as having a sexual significance, this in no\r\nway mars the original purity of the image. The subjective had been\r\ntransformed into the objective; Spirit had fallen into Matter. The\r\nuniversal kosmic polarity of Spirit‐Substance had become, in human\r\nthought, the mystic, but still sexual, union of Spirit and Matter, and had\r\nthus acquired an anthropomorphic colouring which it had never had in the\r\nbeginning. Between the _Vedas_ and the _Purânas_ there is an abyss of\r\nwhich they are the poles, like as are the seventh principle, the Âtmâ, and\r\nthe first or lowest principle, the Physical Body, in the septenary\r\nconstitution of Man. The primitive and purely spiritual language of the\r\n_Vedas_, conceived many decades of millenniums earlier than the Paurânic\r\naccounts, found a purely human expression for the purpose of describing\r\nevents which took place 5,000 years ago, the date of Krishna’s death, from\r\nwhich day the Kali Yuga, or Black Age, began for mankind.\r\n\r\nAs Aditi is called Surârani, the Matrix or “Mother” of the Suras or Gods,\r\nso Kuntî, the mother of the Pândavas, is called in the _Mahâbhârata_\r\nPândavârani(1227)—and the term is now _physiologized_. But Devakî, the\r\nantetype of the Roman Catholic Madonna, is a later anthropomorphized form\r\nof Aditi. The latter is the Goddess‐mother, or Deva‐mâtri, of seven Sons\r\n(the six and the seven Âdityas of early Vedic times); the mother of\r\nKrishna, Devakî, has six embryos conveyed into her womb by Jagad‐dhâtri,\r\nthe “Nurse of the World,” the seventh, Krishna, the Logos, being\r\ntransferred to that of Rohinî. Mary, the mother of Jesus, is the mother of\r\nseven children, of five sons and two daughters (a later transformation of\r\nsex), in Matthew’s Gospel.(1228) No one of the worshippers of the Roman\r\nCatholic Virgin would object to reciting in her honour the prayer\r\naddressed by the Gods to Devakî. Let the reader judge.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Thou art that Prakriti [essence], infinite and subtile, which\r\n    formerly bore Brahmâ in its womb.... Thou, eternal being,\r\n    comprising, in thy substance, the essence of all created things,\r\n    wast identical with creation; thou wast the parent of the tri‐form\r\n    sacrifice, becoming the germ of all things. Thou art sacrifice,\r\n    whence all fruit proceeds; thou art the Aranî, whose attrition\r\n    engenders fire.(1229) As Aditi, thou art the parent of the\r\n    gods.... Thou art light [Jyotsnâ, the morning twilight],(1230)\r\n    whence day is begotten. Thou art humility [Samnati, a daughter of\r\n    Daksha], the mother of wisdom; thou art Niti, the parent of\r\n    harmony (Naya);(1231) thou art modesty, the progenitrix of\r\n    affection [Prashraya, explained by Vinaya]; thou art desire, of\r\n    whom love is born.... Thou art ... the mother of knowledge\r\n    [Avabodha]; thou art patience [Dhriti], the parent of fortitude\r\n    [Dhairya].(1232)\r\n\r\n\r\nThus Aranî is shown here to be the same as the Roman Catholic “Vase of\r\nElection.” As to its primitive meaning, it was purely metaphysical. No\r\nunclean thought traversed these conceptions in the ancient mind. Even in\r\nthe _Zohar_—far less metaphysical in its symbology than any other\r\nsymbolism—the idea is an abstraction and nothing more. Thus, when the\r\n_Zohar_ says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    All that which exists, all that which has been formed by the\r\n    ancient, whose name is holy, can only exist through a male and\r\n    female principle.(1233)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt means no more than that the divine Spirit of Life is ever coalescing\r\nwith Matter. It is the Will of the Deity that acts; and the idea is purely\r\nSchopenhauerian.\r\n\r\n\r\n    When Atteekah Kaddosha, the ancient and the concealed of the\r\n    concealed, desired to form all things, it formed all things like\r\n    male and female. This wisdom comprises _all_ when it goeth forth.\r\n\r\n\r\nHence Chokmah (male Wisdom) and Binah (female Consciousness or Intellect)\r\nare said to create all between the two—the active and the passive\r\nprinciples. As the eye of the expert jeweller discerns under the rough and\r\nuncouth oyster shell the pure immaculate pearl, enshrined within its\r\nbosom, his hand touching the shell but to get at its contents, so the eye\r\nof the true Philosopher reads between the lines of the _Purânas_ the\r\nsublime Vedic truths, and corrects the form with the help of the Vedântic\r\nWisdom. Our Orientalists, however, never perceive the pearl under the\r\nthick coating of the shell and—act accordingly.\r\n\r\nFrom all that has been said in this Section, one sees clearly that,\r\nbetween the Serpent of Eden and the Devil of Christianity, there is an\r\nabyss. Alone the sledge hammer of Ancient Philosophy can kill this dogma.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection VII. Enoïchion‐Henoch.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the evolution of the Satanic Myth would not be complete if\r\nwe omitted to notice the character of the mysterious and cosmopolitan\r\nEnoch, variously called Enos, Hanoch, and finally Enoïchion by the Greeks.\r\nIt is from his book that the first notions of the Fallen Angels were taken\r\nby the early Christian writers.\r\n\r\nThe _Book of Enoch_ is declared apocryphal. But what is an _apocryphon_?\r\nThe very etymology of the term shows that it is simply a _secret_ book,\r\n_i.e._, one that belonged to the catalogue of temple‐libraries under the\r\nguardianship of the Hierophants and Initiated Priests, and was never meant\r\nfor the profane. _Apocryphon_ comes from the verb _crypto_ (κρύπτω), “to\r\nhide.” For ages the _Enoïchion_, the Book of the Seer, was preserved in\r\nthe “city of letters” and secret works—the ancient Kirjath‐sepher, later\r\non, Debir.(1234)\r\n\r\nSome of the writers interested in the subject—especially Masons—have tried\r\nto identify Enoch with Thoth of Memphis, the Greek Hermes, and even with\r\nthe Latin Mercury. As individuals, all of these are distinct one from the\r\nother; professionally—if one may use this word, now so limited in its\r\nsense—one and all belong to the same category of sacred writers, of\r\nInitiators and Recorders of Occult and ancient Wisdom. Those who in the\r\n_Korân_(1235) are generically termed the Edris, or the “Learned,” the\r\nInitiated, bore in Egypt the name of “Thoth,” the inventor of Arts,\r\nSciences, of writing or letters, of Music and Astronomy. Among the Jews\r\nEdris became “Enoch,” who, according to Bar‐Hebræus, “was the first\r\ninventor of writing,” books, Arts, and Sciences, the first who reduced to\r\na system the progress of the planets.(1236) In Greece he was called\r\nOrpheus, and thus changed his name with every nation. The number seven\r\nbeing attached to, and connected with, each of those primitive\r\nInitiators,(1237) as well as the number 365, of the days in the year,\r\nastronomically, it identifies the mission, character, and the sacred\r\noffice of all these men, but certainly not their personalities. Enoch is\r\nthe _seventh_ Patriarch; Orpheus is the possessor of the Phorminx, the\r\nseven‐stringed lyre, which is the seven‐fold mystery of Initiation. Thoth,\r\nwith the seven‐rayed Solar Discus on his head, travels in the Solar Boat\r\n(the 365 degrees), jumping out every fourth (leap) year for one day.\r\nFinally, Thoth‐Lunus is the septenary God of the seven days, or the week.\r\nEsoterically and spiritually, Enoïchion means the “Seer of the Open Eye.”\r\n\r\nThe story about Enoch, told by Josephus, namely, that he had concealed his\r\nprecious Rolls or Books under the pillars of Mercury or Seth, is the same\r\nas that told of Hermes, the “Father of Wisdom,” who concealed his Books of\r\nWisdom under a pillar, and then, discovering the two pillars of stone,\r\nfound the Science written thereon. Yet Josephus, notwithstanding his\r\nconstant efforts in the direction of Israel’s unmerited glorification, and\r\nthough he does attribute that Science (of Wisdom) to the _Jewish_\r\nEnoch—writes _history_. He shows these pillars as still existing during\r\nhis own time.(1238) He tells us that they were built by Seth; and so they\r\nmay have been, only neither by the Patriarch of that name, the fabled son\r\nof Adam, nor by the Egyptian God of Wisdom—Teth, Set, Thoth, Tat, Sat (the\r\nlater Sat‐an), or Hermes, who are all one—but by the “Sons of the Serpent‐\r\nGod,” or “Sons of the Dragon,” the name under which the Hierophants of\r\nEgypt and Babylon were known before the Deluge, as were their forefathers,\r\nthe Atlanteans.\r\n\r\nWhat Josephus tells us, therefore, with the exception of the application\r\nmade of it, must be true _allegorically_. According to his version the two\r\nfamous pillars were entirely covered with hieroglyphics, which, after\r\ntheir discovery, were copied and reproduced in the most secret corners of\r\nthe inner temples of Egypt, and thus became the source of its Wisdom and\r\nexceptional learning. These two “pillars,” however, are the prototypes of\r\nthe two “tables of stones” hewn by Moses at the command of the “Lord.”\r\nHence, in saying that all the great Adepts and Mystics of antiquity—such\r\nas Orpheus, Hesiod, Pythagoras and Plato—got the elements of their\r\nTheology from those hieroglyphics, he is right in one sense, and wrong in\r\nanother. The Secret Doctrine teaches us that the Arts, Sciences, Theology,\r\nand especially the Philosophy of every nation which preceded the last\r\n_universally known_, but not universal, Deluge, had been recorded\r\nideographically from the primitive oral records of the Fourth Race, and\r\nthat these were the inheritance of the latter from the early Third Root‐\r\nRace before the allegorical Fall. Hence, also, the Egyptian pillars, the\r\ntablets, and even the “white oriental porphyry stone” of the Masonic\r\nlegend—which Enoch, fearing that the real and precious secrets would be\r\nlost, concealed before the Deluge in the bowels of the Earth—were simply\r\nthe more or less symbolical and allegorical copies from the primitive\r\nRecords. The _Book of Enoch_ is one of such copies, and is, moreover, a\r\nChaldæan, and now very incomplete, compendium. As already said, Enoïchion\r\nmeans in Greek the “Inner Eye,” or the Seer; in Hebrew, _with the help of\r\nMasoretic points_, it means the “Initiator” and “Instructor” (חֲנוֹךּ).\r\nEnoch is a generic title; and, moreover, his legend is that of several\r\nother prophets, Jewish and Heathen, with changes of made‐up details, the\r\nroot‐form being the same. Elijah is also taken up into Heaven “alive”; and\r\nthe Astrologer, at the court of Isdubar, the Chaldæan Hea‐bani, is\r\nlikewise raised to Heaven by the God Hea, who was _his_ patron, as Jehovah\r\nwas of Elijah, whose name means in Hebrew “God‐Jah,” Jehovah\r\n(אֶלְיָה),(1239) and again of Elihu, which has the same meaning. This kind\r\nof easy death, or _euthanasia_, has an Esoteric meaning. It symbolizes the\r\n“death” of any Adept who has reached the power and degree, and also the\r\npurification, which enable him to “die” in the Physical Body, and _still\r\nlive and lead a conscious life_ in his Astral Body. The variations on this\r\ntheme are endless, but the secret meaning is ever the same. The Pauline\r\nexpression,(1240) “that he should not see death” (_ut non videret\r\nmortem_), has thus an Esoteric meaning, but nothing _supernatural_ in it.\r\nThe mangled interpretation given of some biblical hints to the effect that\r\nEnoch, “whose years will equal those of the world” (of the _solar_ year,\r\n365 days), will share with Christ and the prophet Elijah the honours and\r\nbliss of the last Advent and of the destruction of\r\nAntichrist(1241)—signify Esoterically, that some of the Great Adepts will\r\nreturn in the Seventh Race, when all Error will be made away with, and the\r\nadvent of Truth will be heralded by those Shishta, the holy “Sons of\r\nLight.”\r\n\r\nThe Latin Church is not always logical, nor prudent. She declares the\r\n_Book of Enoch_ an _apocryphon_, and has gone so far as to claim, through\r\nCardinal Cajetan and other luminaries of the Church, the rejection from\r\nthe Canon of even the Book of Jude, who, otherwise, as an _inspired_\r\napostle, would quote from and thus sanctify the _Book of Enoch_, which is\r\nalleged to be an apocryphal work. Fortunately, some of the dogmatics\r\nperceived the peril in time. Had they accepted Cajetan’s resolution, they\r\nwould have been forced to reject likewise the Fourth Gospel; as St. John\r\nborrows literally from Enoch, and places _a whole sentence_ from him, in\r\nthe mouth of Jesus!(1242)\r\n\r\nLudolph, the “father of Ethiopic literature,” commissioned to investigate\r\nthe various Enochian MSS. presented by Pereisc, the traveller, to the\r\nMazarine Library, declared that “no _Book of Enoch_ could exist among the\r\nAbyssinians”! Further researches and discoveries worsted this too dogmatic\r\nassertion, as all know. Bruce and Ruppel did find the _Book of Enoch_ in\r\nAbyssinia, and what is more, brought it to Europe some years later, and\r\nBishop Laurence translated it. But Bruce despised it, and scoffed at its\r\ncontents; as did all the rest of the Scientists. He declared it a\r\n_Gnostic_ work, concerning the Age of Giants who devour men—and bearing a\r\nstrong resemblance to the _Apocalypse_.(1243) Giants! another _fairy‐\r\ntale_!\r\n\r\nSuch, however, has not been the opinion of all the best critics. Dr.\r\nHanneberg places the _Book of Enoch_ along with the _Third Book of the\r\nMaccabees—at the head of the list of those whose authority stands the\r\nnearest to that of the canonical works_.(1244)\r\n\r\nVerily, “where doctors disagree...”!\r\n\r\nAs usual, however, they are all right and all wrong. To accept Enoch as a\r\nbiblical character, a single living person, is like accepting Adam as the\r\nfirst man. Enoch was a generic title, applied to, and borne by, scores of\r\nindividuals, at all times and ages, and in every race and nation. This may\r\nbe easily inferred from the fact that the ancient Talmudists and the\r\nteachers of Midrashim are not agreed generally in their views about\r\nHanokh, the Son of Yered. Some say Enoch was a great Saint, beloved by\r\nGod, and “taken alive to heaven,” _i.e._, one who reached Mukti or\r\nNirvâna, on Earth, as Buddha did and others still do; and others maintain\r\nthat he was a sorcerer, a wicked magician. This shows only that “Enoch,”\r\nor its equivalent, was a term, even during the days of the later\r\nTalmudists, which meant “Seer,” “Adept in the Secret Wisdom,” etc.,\r\nwithout any specification as to the character of the title‐bearer.\r\nJosephus, speaking of Elijah and Enoch,(1245) remarks that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is written in the sacred books they [Elijah and Enoch]\r\n    disappeared, but so that nobody knew that they died.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt means simply that _they had died in their personalities_, as Yogîs die\r\nto this day in India, or even some Christian monks—to the world. They\r\ndisappear from the sight of men and die—on the terrestrial plane—even for\r\nthemselves. A seemingly figurative way of speaking, yet _literally true_.\r\n\r\n“Hanokh transmitted the science of (astronomical) calculation and of\r\ncomputing the seasons to Noah,” says the Midrash _Pirkah_;(1246) R.\r\nEliezar referring to Enoch that which others did to Hermes Trismegistus,\r\nfor the two are identical in their Esoteric meaning. “Hanokh” in this\r\ncase, and his “Wisdom,” belong to the cycle of the Fourth Atlantean\r\nRace,(1247) and Noah to that of the Fifth.(1248) In this case both\r\nrepresent the Root‐Races, the present one and the one that preceded it. In\r\nanother sense, Enoch disappeared, “he walked with God, and he was not, for\r\nGod took him”; the allegory referring to the disappearance of the Sacred\r\nand Secret Knowledge from among men; for “God” (or Java Aleim—the high\r\nHierophants, the Heads of the Colleges of Initiated Priests(1249)) took\r\nhim; in other words, the Enochs or the Enoïchions, the Seers and their\r\nKnowledge and Wisdom, became strictly confined to the Secret Colleges of\r\nthe Prophets with the Jews, and to the Temples with the Gentiles.\r\n\r\nInterpreted with the help of merely the symbolical key, Enoch is the type\r\nof the dual nature of man—spiritual and physical. Hence he occupies the\r\ncentre of the Astronomical Cross, as given by Éliphas Lévi from a secret\r\nwork, which is a Six‐pointed Star, the “Adonai.” In the upper angle of the\r\nupper Triangle is the Eagle; in the left lower angle stands the Lion; in\r\nthe right, the Bull; while between the Bull and the Lion, over them and\r\nunder the Eagle, is the face of Enoch or Man.(1250) Now the figures on the\r\nupper Triangle represent the Four Races, omitting the First, the Chhâyâs\r\nor Shadows, and the “Son of Man,” Enos or Enoch, is in the centre, where\r\nhe stands between the Fourth and the Fifth Races, for he represents the\r\nSecret Wisdom of both. These are the four Animals of _Ezekiel_ and of the\r\n_Revelation_. This Double Triangle which, in _Isis Unveiled_, is faced by\r\nthe Hindû Ardhanârî, is by far the best. For in the latter, only the three\r\n(for us) historical Races are symbolized; the Third, the Androgynous, by\r\nArdha‐nârî; the Fourth, symbolized by the strong, powerful Lion; and the\r\nFifth, the Âryan, by that which is its most sacred symbol to this day, the\r\nBull (and the Cow).\r\n\r\nA man of great erudition, a French _savant_, M. de Sacy, finds several\r\nmost singular statements in the _Book of Enoch_, “worthy of the most\r\nserious examination,” he says. For instance:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The author [Enoch] makes the solar year consist of 364 days, and\r\n    seems to know periods of three, of five, and of eight years,\r\n    followed by _four_ supplementary days, which, in his system,\r\n    appear to be those of the equinoxes and solstices.(1251)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo which he adds, later on:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I see but one means to palliate them [these “absurdities”]; it is\r\n    to suppose that the author expounds some fanciful system which may\r\n    have existed _before the order of Nature had been altered at the\r\n    period of the Universal Deluge_.(1252)\r\n\r\n\r\nPrecisely so; and the Secret Doctrine teaches that this “order of nature”\r\nhas been thus altered, and the series of the Earth’s humanities too. For,\r\nas the angel Uriel tells Enoch:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Behold, I have showed thee all things, O Enoch; and all things\r\n    have I revealed to thee. Thou seest the sun, the moon, and _those\r\n    which conduct the stars_ of heaven, which cause all their\r\n    operations, seasons, and arrivals to return. In the days of\r\n    sinners _the years shall be shortened_.... The moon shall change\r\n    its laws....(1253)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn those days also, years before the Great Deluge that carried away the\r\nAtlanteans and changed the face of the whole Earth (because “the _Earth_\r\n[or its axis] _became inclined_”), Nature, geologically, astronomically,\r\nand cosmically in general, could not have been the same, just because the\r\nEarth _had inclined_. To quote from Enoch:\r\n\r\n\r\n    And Noah cried with a bitter voice, Hear me; hear me; hear me;\r\n    three times. And he said,... The earth labours and is violently\r\n    shaken. Surely, I shall perish with it.(1254)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis, by the way, looks like one of those many “inconsistencies,” if the\r\n_Bible_ is read literally. For, to say the least, this is a very strange\r\nfear in one who had “found grace in the eyes of the Lord” and been told to\r\nbuild an Ark! But here we find the venerable Patriarch expressing as much\r\nfear as if, instead of a “friend” of God, he had been one of the Giants\r\ndoomed by the wrathful Deity. The Earth had already _inclined_, and the\r\ndeluge of waters had become simply a question of time, and yet Noah seems\r\nto know nothing of his intended salvation.\r\n\r\nA decree had come indeed; the decree of Nature and the Law of Evolution,\r\nthat the Earth should change its Race, and that the Fourth Race should be\r\ndestroyed to make room for a better one. The Manvantara had reached its\r\nturning point of _three and a half_ Rounds, and gigantic physical Humanity\r\nhad reached the acme of gross materiality. Hence the apocalyptic verse\r\nthat speaks of a commandment gone forth that they may be destroyed, “that\r\n_their end may be_”—the end of the Race:\r\n\r\n\r\n    For they _knew_ [truly] every secret of the angels, every\r\n    oppressive and secret power of the _Satans_, and every power of\r\n    those who commit sorcery, as well as of those who make molten\r\n    images in the whole earth.(1255)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now a natural question. Who could have informed the apocryphal author\r\nof this powerful vision—no matter to what age he may be assigned before\r\nthe day of Galileo—that the Earth could occasionally incline her axis?\r\nWhence did he derive such astronomical and geological knowledge if the\r\nSecret Wisdom, of which the ancient Rishis and Pythagoras had drunk, is\r\nbut a fancy, an invention of later ages? Has Enoch read prophetically\r\nperchance in Fréderic Klée’s work on the Deluge the lines:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The position of the terrestrial globe with reference to the sun\r\n    has evidently been, in primitive times, different from what it is\r\n    now; and this difference must have been caused by a displacement\r\n    of the axis of rotation of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis reminds one of that _unscientific_ statement made by the Egyptian\r\npriests to Herodotus, namely, that the Sun has not always risen where it\r\nrises _now_, and that in former times the ecliptic had cut the equator at\r\nright angles.(1256)\r\n\r\nThere are many such “dark sayings” scattered throughout the _Purânas_,\r\n_Bible_ and other Mythologies, and to the Occultist they divulge two\r\nfacts; (_a_) that the Ancients knew as well as, and perhaps better than,\r\nthe moderns do, Astronomy, Geognosy and Cosmography in general; and (_b_)\r\nthat the behaviour of the Globe has altered more than once since the\r\nprimitive state of things. Thus, Xenophantes—on the _blind_ faith of _his_\r\n“ignorant” religion, which taught that Phaeton, in his desire to learn the\r\n_hidden_ truth, made the Sun deviate from its usual course—asserts\r\nsomewhere that, “the Sun turned toward another country”; which is a\r\nparallel—slightly more scientific, however, if not as bold—of Joshua\r\nstopping the course of the Sun altogether. Yet it may explain the teaching\r\nof the Northern Mythology that before the _actual order_ of things the Sun\r\narose in the South, and its placing the Frigid Zone (Jeruskoven) in the\r\nEast, whereas now it is in the North.(1257)\r\n\r\nThe _Book of Enoch_, in short, is a _résumé_, a compound of the main\r\nfeatures of the history of the Third, Fourth and Fifth Races; a very few\r\nprophecies from the present age of the world; a long retrospective,\r\nintrospective and prophetic summary of universal and quite _historical_\r\nevents—geological, ethnological, astronomical, and psychic—with a touch of\r\nTheogony out of the antediluvian records. The Book of this mysterious\r\npersonage is referred to and quoted copiously in the _Pistis Sophia_, and\r\nalso in the _Zohar_ and its most ancient Midrashim. Origen and Clement of\r\nAlexandria held it in the highest esteem. To say, therefore, that it is a\r\nPost‐Christian forgery is to utter an absurdity and to become guilty of an\r\nanachronism, for Origen, among others, who lived in the second century of\r\nthe Christian era, mentions it as an ancient and venerable work. The\r\nsecret and sacred Name and its potency are well and clearly though\r\nallegorically described in the old volume. From the eighteenth to the\r\nfiftieth chapter, the Visions of Enoch are all descriptive of the\r\nMysteries of Initiation, one of which is the Burning Valley of the “Fallen\r\nAngels.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps St. Augustine was quite right in saying that the Church rejected\r\nthe _Book of Enoch_ out of her canon owing to its too great antiquity (_ob\r\nnimiam antiquitatem_).(1258) There was no room for the events noticed in\r\nit within the limit of the 4004 years B.C. assigned to the world from its\r\n“creation”!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection VIII. The Symbolism of the Mystery‐Names Iao and Jehovah, with\r\ntheir Relation to the Cross and Circle.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Abbé Louis Constant, better known as Éliphas Lévi, said in his\r\n_Histoire de la Magie_ that the _Sepher Jetzirah_, the _Zohar_, and the\r\n_Apocalypse_ of St. John, are the masterpieces of the Occult Sciences, he\r\nought, if he had wished to be correct and clear, to have added—in Europe.\r\nIt is quite true that these works contain “more _significance_ than\r\nwords”; and that their “expression is poetical,” while “in numbers” they\r\nare “exact.” Unfortunately, however, before any one can appreciate the\r\n_poetry_ of the expressions, or the _exactness_ of the numbers, he will\r\nhave to learn the real significance and meaning of the terms and symbols\r\nemployed. But man will never learn this so long as he remains ignorant of\r\nthe fundamental principle of the Secret Doctrine, whether in Oriental\r\nEsotericism, or in the kabalistical Symbology—the _key, or value, in all\r\ntheir aspects_, of the God‐names, Angel‐names, and Patriarch‐names in the\r\n_Bible_, their mathematical or geometrical value, and their relations to\r\nmanifested Nature.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if, on the one hand, the _Zohar_ “astonishes” the mystic, by\r\nthe profundity of its views and the great simplicity of its images, or the\r\nother hand, that work misleads the student by such expressions as those\r\nused with respect to Ain Suph and Jehovah, notwithstanding the assurance\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The book is careful to explain that the human form with which it\r\n    clothes God is but _an image of the Word_, and that God should not\r\n    be expressed by any thought, or any form.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is well known that Origen Clement, and the Rabbis confessed that the\r\n_Kabalah_ and the _Bible_ were _veiled and secret_ books; but few know\r\nthat the Esotericism of the kabalistic books in their present _reëdited_\r\nform is simply another and still more cunning veil thrown upon the\r\nprimitive symbolism of these secret volumes.\r\n\r\nThe idea of representing the _hidden_ Deity by the circumference of a\r\ncircle, and the Creative Power—male and female, or the Androgynous Word—by\r\nthe diameter across it, is one of the oldest symbols. It is upon this\r\nconception that every great Cosmogony has been built. With the old Âryans,\r\nthe Egyptians, and the Chaldæans, the symbol was complete, as it embraced\r\nthe idea of the eternal and immovable Divine Thought in its absoluteness,\r\nseparated entirely from the incipient stage of the so‐called “creation,”\r\nand comprised psychological and even spiritual evolution, and its\r\nmechanical work, or cosmogonical construction. With the Hebrews, however,\r\nthough the former conception is to be distinctly found in the _Zohar_, and\r\nthe _Sepher Jetzirah_, or what remains of the latter—that which has been\r\nsubsequently embodied in the _Pentateuch_ proper, and especially in\r\n_Genesis_, is simply this secondary stage, to wit, the mechanical law of\r\ncreation, or rather of construction; while Theogony is hardly, if at all,\r\noutlined.\r\n\r\nIt is only in the first six chapters of _Genesis_, in the rejected _Book\r\nof Enoch_, and the misunderstood and mistranslated poem of _Job_, that\r\ntrue echoes of the Archaic Doctrine may now be found. The key to it is\r\nlost now, even among the most learned Rabbis, whose predecessors in the\r\nearly period of the Middle Ages, in their national exclusiveness and\r\npride, and especially in their profound hatred of Christianity, preferred\r\nto cast it into the deep sea of oblivion, rather than to share their\r\nknowledge with their relentless and fierce persecutors. Jehovah was their\r\nown tribal property, inseparable from, and unfit to play a part in, any\r\nother but the Mosaic Law. Violently torn out of his original frame, which\r\nhe fitted and which fitted him, the “Lord God of Abraham and Jacob” could\r\nhardly be crammed without damage and breakage into the new Christian\r\nCanon. Being the weaker, the Judeans could not help the desecration. They\r\nkept, however, the secret of the origin of their Adam Kadmon, or male‐\r\nfemale Jehovah, and the new tabernacle proved a complete misfit for the\r\nold God. They were, indeed, avenged!\r\n\r\nThe statement that Jehovah was the tribal God of the Jews and no higher,\r\nwill be denied like many other things. Yet the Theologians are not in a\r\nposition to tell us, in that case, the meaning of the verses in\r\n_Deuteronomy_, which say quite plainly:\r\n\r\n\r\n    When the Most High [not the “Lord,” or “Jehovah” either] divided\r\n    to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of\r\n    Adam, he set the bounds ... according to the number of the\r\n    children of Israel.... _The Lord’s_ [Jehovah’s] _portion is his\r\n    people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance_.(1259)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis settles the question. So impudent have been the modern translators of\r\nBibles and Scriptures, and so damaging are these verses, that, following\r\nin the steps traced for them by their worthy Church Fathers, each\r\ntranslator has rendered these lines in his own way. While the above‐cited\r\nquotation is taken _verbatim_ from the English Authorized Version, in the\r\nFrench Bible,(1260) we find the “Most High” translated by “Souverain”\r\n(Sovereign!!), the “sons of Adam” rendered by “the children of men,” and\r\nthe “Lord” changed into the “Eternal.” For impudent sleight‐of‐hand, the\r\nFrench Protestant Church seems thus to have surpassed even English\r\necclesiasticism.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, one thing is patent: the “Lord’s [Jehovah’s] portion” is his\r\n“chosen people” and none else, for, _Jacob alone is the lot of his\r\ninheritance_. What, then, have other nations, who call themselves Âryans,\r\nto do with this Semitic Deity, the tribal God of Israel? Astronomically,\r\nthe “Most High” is the Sun, and the “Lord” is one of his seven planets,\r\nwhether it be Iao, the Genius of the Moon, or Ildabaoth‐Jehovah, the\r\nGenius of Saturn, according to Origen and the Egyptian Gnostics.(1261) Let\r\nthe “Angel Gabriel,” the “Lord” of Iran, watch over his people, and\r\nMichael‐Jehovah, over his Hebrews. These are not the Gods of other\r\nnations, nor were they ever those of Jesus. As each Persian Dev is chained\r\nto his planet,(1262) so each Hindû Deva (a “Lord”) has its allotted\r\nportion, a world, a planet, a nation or a race. Plurality of worlds\r\nimplies plurality of Gods. We believe in the former, and may recognize,\r\nbut will never worship the latter.(1263)\r\n\r\nIt has been repeatedly stated in this work that every religious and\r\nphilosophical symbol had seven meanings attached to it, each pertaining to\r\nits legitimate plane of thought, _i.e._, either purely metaphysical or\r\nastronomical; psychic or physiological, etc. These seven meanings and\r\ntheir applications are difficult enough to learn when taken by themselves;\r\nbut the interpretation and the right comprehension of them become tenfold\r\nmore puzzling, when, instead of being correlated, or made to flow\r\nconsecutively out of, and to follow, each other, each, or any one of these\r\nmeanings, is accepted as the one and sole explanation of the whole\r\nsymbolical idea. An instance may be given, as it admirably illustrates the\r\nstatement. Here are two interpretations, given by two learned Kabalists\r\nand scholars, of one and the same verse in _Exodus_. Moses beseeches the\r\nLord to show him his “glory.” Evidently it is not the crude dead‐letter\r\nphraseology as found in the _Bible_ that is to be accepted. There are\r\n_seven_ meanings in the _Kabalah_, of which we may give two as interpreted\r\nby the said two scholars. One of them translates while explaining:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Thou canst not see My face;... I will put thee in a cleft of the\r\n    rock and I will cover thee with My hand while I pass by. And then\r\n    I will take away Mine hand, and thou shalt see My _a’hoor_,”\r\n    _i.e._, My back.(1264)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then the translator adds in a gloss:\r\n\r\n\r\n    That is, I will show you “My back,” _i.e._, My visible universe,\r\n    My lower manifestations, but, as a man still in the flesh, thou\r\n    canst not see My invisible nature. So proceeds the Qabbalah.(1265)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is correct, and is the cosmo‐metaphysical explanation. And now speaks\r\nthe other Kabalist, giving the numerical meaning. As it involves a good\r\nmany suggestive ideas, and is far more fully given, we may allow it more\r\nspace. This synopsis is from an unpublished MS., and explains more fully\r\nwhat was given in Section III, on the “Holy of Holies.”(1266)\r\n\r\nThe numbers of the name “Moses” are those of “I am that I am,” so that the\r\nnames Moses and Jehovah are at one in numerical harmony. The word Moses is\r\nמשה (5 + 300 + 40), and the sum of the values of its letters is 345;\r\nJehovah—the Genius _par excellence_ of the Lunar Year—assumes the value of\r\n543, or the reverse of 345.\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the third chapter of Exodus, in the 13th and 14th verses, it is\r\n    said: And Moses said, ... Behold I come unto the children of\r\n    Israel, and shall say unto them. The God of your fathers hath sent\r\n    me unto you; and they shall say unto me, What is his name? What\r\n    shall I say unto them? And God said unto Moses,\r\n\r\n    I Am That I Am.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hebrew words for this expression are _âhiyé asher âhiyé_, and in the\r\nvalue of the sums of their letters stand thus:\r\n\r\nאהיה     אשר     אהיה\r\n21      501      21\r\n\r\n\r\n    ... This being his [God’s] name, the sum of the values composing\r\n    it, 21, 501, 21 is 543, or simply a use of the simple digit\r\n    numbers in the name of Moses, ... but now so ordered that the name\r\n    of 345 is reversed, and reads 543.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo that when Moses asks, “Let me see Thy face or glory,” the other rightly\r\nand truly replies, “Thou canst not see my face ... but thou _shalt see me\r\nbehind_”—the true sense, though not the precise words; for the corner and\r\nthe _behind_ of 543 is the _face_ of 345. This is\r\n\r\n\r\n    For check and to keep a _strict use_ of a set of numbers to\r\n    develop certain _grand_ results, for the object of which they are\r\n    specifically employed.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the learned Kabalist adds:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In other uses of the numbers, they saw each other face to face. It\r\n    is strange that if we add 345 to 543 we have 888, which was the\r\n    Gnostic Cabbalistic value of the name Christ, who was Jehoshua or\r\n    Joshua. And so also the division of the 24 hours of the day gives\r\n    three eights as quotient.... The chief end of all this system of\r\n    Number Checks was to preserve in perpetuity the exact value of the\r\n    Lunar Year in the Natural measure of Days.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are the astronomical and numerical meanings in the secret Theogony\r\nof sidereo‐cosmical Gods invented by the Chaldæo‐Hebrews,—two meanings out\r\nof seven. The other five would astonish the Christians still more.\r\n\r\nThe series of Œdipuses who have endeavoured to interpret the riddle of the\r\nSphinx, is long indeed. For many ages she has been devouring the brightest\r\nand the noblest intellects of Christendom; but now the Sphinx is\r\nconquered. In the great intellectual struggle which has ended in the\r\ncomplete victory of the Œdipuses of Symbolism, it is, however, not the\r\nSphinx, who, burning with the shame of defeat, has had to bury herself in\r\nthe sea, but verily the many‐sided symbol, named Jehovah, whom\r\nChristians—the _civilized_ nations—have accepted for their God. The\r\nJehovah symbol has collapsed under the too close analysis, and is—drowned.\r\nSymbologists have discovered with dismay that their adopted Deity was only\r\na mask for many other Gods, a _euhemerized_ extinct planet, at best, the\r\nGenius of the Moon and Saturn with the Jews, of the Sun and Jupiter with\r\nearly Christians; that the Trinity—unless they accepted the more abstract\r\nand metaphysical meanings given to it by the Gentiles—was, in truth, only\r\nan astronomical triad, composed of the Sun (the Father), and the two\r\nplanets Mercury (the Son) and Venus (the Holy Ghost), Sophia, the Spirit\r\nof Wisdom, Love and Truth, and Lucifer, as Christ, the “bright and morning\r\nstar.”(1267) For, if the Father is the Sun (the “Elder Brother,” in the\r\nEastern Inner Philosophy), the nearest planet to it is Mercury (Hermes,\r\nBudha, Thoth), the name of whose Mother on Earth was Maia. Now this planet\r\nreceives seven times more light than any other; a fact which led the\r\nGnostics to call their Christos, and the Kabalists their Hermes (in the\r\nastronomical meaning), the “Seven‐fold Light.” Finally, _this_ God was\r\nBel—the Sun being Bel with the Gauls; Helios, with the Greeks; Baal, with\r\nthe Phœnicians; El, in Chaldæan, hence El‐ohim, Emanu‐el, and El, “God,”\r\nin Hebrew. But even the kabalistic God has vanished in the rabbinical\r\nworkmanship, and one has now to turn to the innermost metaphysical sense\r\nof the _Zohar_ to find in it anything like Ain Suph, the Nameless Deity\r\nand the Absolute, so authoritatively and loudly claimed by the Christians.\r\nBut it is certainly not to be found in the Mosaic books, at any rate by\r\nthose who try to read without a key to them. Ever since this key was lost,\r\nJews and Christians have tried their best to blend these two conceptions,\r\nbut in vain. They have only succeeded in finally robbing even the\r\nUniversal Deity of Its majestic character and primitive meaning.\r\n\r\nAs was said in _Isis Unveiled_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It would seem, therefore, but natural to make a difference between\r\n    the mystery‐god Ιαω, adopted from the highest antiquity by all who\r\n    participated in the esoteric knowledge of the priests, and his\r\n    phonetic counterparts, whom we find treated with so little\r\n    reverence by the Ophites and other Gnostics.(1268)\r\n\r\n    In the Ophite gems of King,(1269) we find the name of Iao\r\n    repeated, and often confounded with that of Ievo, while the latter\r\n    simply represents one of the Genii antagonistic to Abraxas.... But\r\n    the name Iao neither originated with, nor was it the sole property\r\n    of the Jews. Even if it had pleased Moses to bestow the name upon\r\n    the tutelary “Spirit,” the alleged protector and national deity of\r\n    the “chosen people of Israel,” there is yet no possible reason why\r\n    other nationalities should receive Him as the Highest and One‐\r\n    living God. But we deny the assumption altogether. Besides, there\r\n    is the fact that Iaho or Iao was a “mystery name” from the\r\n    beginning, for יהיה and יה never came into use before the time of\r\n    king David. Anterior to his time, few or no proper names were\r\n    compounded with Iah or Jah. It looks rather as though David, being\r\n    a sojourner among the Tyrians and Philistines,(1270) brought\r\n    thence the name of Jehovah. He made Zadok high priest, from whom\r\n    came the Zadokites or Sadducees. He lived and ruled first at\r\n    Hebron (חברון), Habir‐on or Kabeir‐town, where the rites of the\r\n    four (mystery‐gods) were celebrated. Neither David nor Solomon\r\n    recognized either Moses or the law of Moses. They aspired to build\r\n    a temple to יהוה, like the structures erected by Hiram to Hercules\r\n    and Venus, Adon and Astarte.\r\n\r\n    Says Fürst: “The very ancient name of God, Yâho, written in the\r\n    Greek Ιαω, appears, apart _from its derivation_, to have been an\r\n    old mystic name of the Supreme Deity of the Shemites. Hence it was\r\n    told to Moses when he was initiated at Hor‐eb—the _Cave_—under the\r\n    direction of Jethro, the Kenite (or Cainite) priest of Midian. In\r\n    an old religion of the Chaldæans, whose remains are to be found\r\n    among the Neo‐Platonists, the highest Divinity, enthroned above\r\n    the seven Heavens, representing the Spiritual Light‐Principle, ...\r\n    and also conceived of as Demiurgus,(1271) was called Ιαω (יהו),\r\n    who was, like the Hebrew Yâho, mysterious and unmentionable, and\r\n    whose name was communicated to the Initiated. The Phœnicians had a\r\n    Supreme God, whose name was triliteral and _secret_, and he was\r\n    Ιαω.”(1272)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cross, say the Kabalists, repeating the lesson of the Occultists, is\r\none of the most ancient—nay, perhaps, the _most_ ancient of symbols. This\r\nhas been demonstrated at the very beginning of the Proem in Volume I. The\r\nEastern Initiates show it coëval with the circle of Deific Infinitude and\r\nthe first differentiation of the Essence, the union of Spirit and Matter.\r\nThis interpretation has been rejected, and the astronomical allegory alone\r\nhas been accepted and made to fit into cunningly imagined terrestrial\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nLet us demonstrate this statement. In Astronomy, as said, Mercury is the\r\nson of Cœlus and Lux—of the Sky and Light, or the Sun; in Mythology he is\r\nthe progeny of Jupiter and Maia. He is the “Messenger” of his Father\r\nJupiter, the Messiah of the Sun; in Greek, his name Hermes means, among\r\nother things, the “Interpreter”—the Word, the Logos, or Verbum. Now\r\nMercury is born on Mount Cyllene among shepherds, and is the patron of the\r\nlatter. As a psychopompic Genius, he conducted the Souls of the Dead to\r\nHades and brought them back again, an office attributed to Jesus after his\r\nDeath and Resurrection. The symbols of Hermes‐Mercury (Dii Termini) were\r\nplaced along, and at the turning points of, highways, as crosses are now\r\nplaced in Italy, and they were _cruciform_.(1273) Every seventh day the\r\npriests anointed these Termini with oil, and once a year hung them with\r\ngarlands, hence they were the _anointed_. Mercury, when speaking through\r\nhis oracles, says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I am he whom you call the Son of the Father [Jupiter] and Maia.\r\n    Leaving the King of Heaven [the Sun] I come to help you, mortals.\r\n\r\n\r\nMercury heals the blind and restores sight, mental and physical.(1274) He\r\nwas often represented as three‐headed and called Tricephalus, Triplex, as\r\none with the Sun and Venus. Finally, Mercury, as Cornutus(1275) shows, was\r\nsometimes figured under a cubic form, without arms, because “the power of\r\nspeech and eloquence can prevail without the assistance of arms or feet.”\r\nIt is this cubic form which connects the Termini directly with the cross,\r\nand it is the eloquence or the power of speech of Mercury which made the\r\ncrafty Eusebius say, “Hermes is the emblem of the Word which creates and\r\ninterprets all,” for it is the Creative Word; and he shows Porphyry\r\nteaching that the Speech of Hermes—now interpreted “Word of God” (!) in\r\n_Pymander_—a Creative Speech (Verbum), is the Seminal Principle scattered\r\nthroughout the Universe.(1276) In Alchemy “Mercury” is the radical “Moyst”\r\nPrinciple, Primitive or Elementary Water, containing the Seed of the\r\nUniverse, fecundated by the Solar Fires. To express this fecundating\r\nprinciple, a phallus was often added to the cross (the male and female, or\r\nthe vertical and the horizontal united) by the Egyptians. The cruciform\r\nTermini also represented this dual idea, which was found in Egypt in the\r\n_cubic_ Hermes. The author of _Source of Measures_ tells us why.(1277)\r\n\r\nAs shown by him, the cube unfolded becomes in display a cross of the Tau,\r\nor the Egyptian, form; or again, “the circle attached to the Tau gives the\r\nansated cross” of the old Pharaohs. They had known this from their priests\r\nand their “King‐Initiates” for ages, and also what was meant by “the\r\nattachment of a man to the cross,” which idea “was made to coördinate with\r\nthat of the origin of human life, and hence the _phallic form_.” Only the\r\nlatter came into action æons and ages after the idea of the Carpenter and\r\nArtificer of the Gods, Vishva‐karmâ, crucifying the “Sun‐Initiate” on the\r\ncruciform lathe. As the same author writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n    _The attachment of a man to the cross_ ... was made use of in this\r\n    form of display by the Hindûs.(1278)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, it was made “to coördinate” with the idea of the new rebirth of man\r\nby _spiritual_, not physical regeneration. The Candidate for Initiation\r\nwas attached to the Tau or astronomical cross with a far grander and\r\nnobler idea than that of the origin of mere _terrestrial_ life.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Semites seem to have had no other or higher purpose\r\nin life than that of procreating their species. Thus, geometrically, and\r\naccording to the reading of the _Bible_ by means of the numerical method,\r\nthe author of _The Source of Measures_ is quite correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The entire [Jewish] system seems to have been anciently regarded\r\n    as one resting in nature, and one which was adopted by nature, or\r\n    God, as the _basis or law_ of the exertion practically of creative\r\n    power—_i.e._, it was the _creative design_, of which creation was\r\n    practically the application. This seems to be established by the\r\n    fact that, under the system set forth, measures of _planetary\r\n    times_ serve coördinately as measures of the _size_ of planets,\r\n    and of the peculiarity of their shapes—_i.e._, in the extension of\r\n    their equatorial and polar diameters.... This system [that of\r\n    creative design] seems to underlie the whole Biblical structure,\r\n    as a foundation for its _ritualism_ and for its display of the\r\n    works of the Deity in the way of _architecture_, by use of the\r\n    sacred unit of measure in the Garden of Eden, the Ark of Noah, the\r\n    Tabernacle, and the Temple of Solomon.(1279)\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, on the very showing of the defenders of this system, the Jewish\r\nDeity is proved to be, at best, only the manifested Duad, never the One\r\nAbsolute All. Geometrically demonstrated, he is a _number_; symbolically,\r\na _euhemerized_ Priapus; and this can hardly satisfy a mankind thirsting\r\nafter the demonstration of real spiritual truths, and the possession of a\r\nGod with a divine, not anthropomorphic, nature. It is strange that the\r\nmost learned of modern Kabalists can see in the cross and circle nothing\r\nbut a symbol of the manifested _creative_ and _androgyne_ Deity in its\r\nrelation to, and interference with, this phenomenal world.(1280) One\r\nauthor believes that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    However man [read, the Jew and Rabbi] obtained knowledge of the\r\n    practical measure, ... by which nature was thought to adjust the\r\n    planets in size to harmonize with the notation of their movements,\r\n    it seems he did obtain it, and esteemed its possession as the\r\n    means of his realization of the Deity—that is, he approached _so\r\n    nearly to a conception of a Being having a mind like his own_,\r\n    only infinitely more powerful, as to be able to realize _a law of\r\n    creation_ established by that Being, which must have existed prior\r\n    to any creation (kabalistically called the Word).(1281)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis may have satisfied the practical _Semite_ mind, but the Eastern\r\nOccultist has to decline the offer of such a God; indeed, a Deity, a\r\nBeing, “having a mind like that of man, only infinitely more powerful,” is\r\n_no_ God that has any room _beyond_ the cycle of creation. He has nought\r\nto do with the _ideal_ conception of the Eternal Universe. He is, at best,\r\none of the _subordinate creative_ powers, the Totality of which is called\r\nthe Sephiroth, the Heavenly Man, and Adam Kadmon, the Second Logos of the\r\nPlatonists.\r\n\r\nThis very same idea is clearly found at the bottom of the ablest\r\ndefinitions of the _Kabalah_ and its mysteries, _e.g._, by John A. Parker,\r\nas quoted in the same work:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The key of the Kabala is _thought to be the geometrical relation\r\n    of the area of the circle inscribed in the square_, or of the cube\r\n    to the sphere, giving rise to the relation of diameter to\r\n    circumference of a circle, with the numerical value of this\r\n    relation expressed in integrals. The relation of diameter to\r\n    circumference, being a supreme one connected with the god‐names\r\n    Elohim and Jehovah (which terms are expressions numerically of\r\n    these relations, respectively—the first being of circumference,\r\n    the latter of diameter), embraces all other subordinations under\r\n    it. Two expressions of circumference to diameter in integrals are\r\n    used in the Bible: (1) The perfect, and (2) The imperfect. One of\r\n    the relations between these is such that (2) subtracted from (1)\r\n    will leave a _unit_ of a diameter value in terms, or in the\r\n    denomination of the circumference value of the perfect circle, or\r\n    a unit straight line having a perfect circular value, or a factor\r\n    of circular value.(1282)\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch calculations can lead one no further than to unriddle the mysteries\r\nof the _third_ stage of Evolution, or the “Third Creation of Brahmâ.” The\r\ninitiated Hindûs know how to “square the circle” far better than any\r\nEuropean. But of this more anon. The fact is that the Western Mystics\r\ncommence their speculation only at that stage when the Universe “falls\r\ninto matter,” as the Occultists say. Throughout the whole series of\r\nkabalistic books we have not met with one sentence that would hint in the\r\nremotest way at the psychological and spiritual, as well as at the\r\nmechanical and _physiological_ secrets of “creation.” Shall we, then,\r\nregard the evolution of the Universe as simply a prototype, on a gigantic\r\nscale, of the act of procreation; as “divine” _phallicism_, and rhapsodize\r\non it as the evilly‐inspired author of a late work of this name has done?\r\nThe writer does not think so. And she feels justified in saying so, since\r\nthe most careful reading of the _Old Testament_—esoterically, as well as\r\nexoterically—seems to have carried the most enthusiastic enquirers no\r\nfurther than a certainty on mathematical grounds that from the first to\r\nthe last chapter of the _Pentateuch_ every scene, every character or event\r\nare shown connected, directly or indirectly, with the _origin of birth_ in\r\nits crudest and most brutal form. Thus, however interesting and ingenious\r\nthe rabbinical methods, the writer, in common with other Eastern\r\nOccultists, must prefer those of the Pagans.\r\n\r\nIt is not, then, in the _Bible_ that we have to search for the origin of\r\nthe cross and circle, but beyond the Flood. Therefore, returning to\r\nÉliphas Lévi and the _Zohar_, we answer for the Eastern Occultists and say\r\nthat, applying practice to principle, they agree entirely with Pascal, who\r\nsays that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    God is a circle, the centre of which is everywhere and the\r\n    circumference nowhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas the Kabalists say the reverse, and maintain it, solely out of\r\ntheir desire to veil their doctrine. By the way, the definition of Deity\r\nby the circle is not Pascal’s at all, as Éliphas Lévi thought. It was\r\n_borrowed_ by the French Philosopher from either Mercury Trismegistus or\r\nCardinal Cusa’s Latin work, _De Doctâ Ignorantiâ_, in which he makes use\r\nof it. It is, moreover, disfigured by Pascal, who replaces the words\r\n“Cosmic Circle,” which stand symbolically in the original inscription, by\r\nthe word Theos. With the Ancients both words were synonymous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Cross And Circle.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the minds of the ancient Philosophers something of the divine and the\r\nmysterious has ever been ascribed to the shape of the circle. The old\r\nworld, consistent in its symbolism and with its Pantheistic intuitions,\r\nuniting the visible and the invisible Infinitudes into one, represented\r\nDeity and its outward Veil alike—by a circle. This merging of the two into\r\na unity, and the name Theos being given indifferently to both, is\r\nexplained, and becomes thereby still more _scientific_ and philosophical.\r\nPlato’s etymological definition of the word _theos_ (θεός) has, been given\r\nelsewhere. In his _Cratylus_, he derives it from the verb _the‐ein_\r\n(θέειν), “to move,” as suggested by the motion of the heavenly bodies\r\nwhich he connects with Deity. According to the Esoteric Philosophy, this\r\nDeity, during its “Nights” and its “Days,” or Cycles of Rest and Activity,\r\nis the “Eternal Perpetual Motion,” the “Ever‐Becoming, as well as the ever\r\nuniversally Present, and the Ever‐Existing.” The latter is the root‐\r\nabstraction; the former is the only possible conception in the human mind,\r\nif it disconnects this Deity from any shape or form. It is a perpetual,\r\nnever‐ceasing evolution, circling back in its incessant progress through\r\næons of duration into its original status—Absolute Unity.\r\n\r\nIt was only the minor Gods who were made to carry the symbolical\r\nattributes of the higher ones. Thus, the God Shoo, the personification of\r\nRa, who appears as the “Great Cat of the Basin of Persæa in An”(1283) was\r\noften represented in the Egyptian monuments seated and holding a cross,\r\nsymbol of the four Quarters, or the Elements, attached to a circle.\r\n\r\nIn that very learned work, _The Natural Genesis_, by Gerald Massey, under\r\nthe heading, “Typology of the Cross,” there is more information to be had\r\non the cross and circle than in any other work we know of. He who would\r\nfain have proofs of the antiquity of the cross is referred to these two\r\nvolumes. The author says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The circle and cross are inseparable.... The Crux Ansata unites\r\n    the circle and cross of the four corners. From this origin the\r\n    circle and the cross came to be interchangeable at times. For\r\n    example, the Chakra, or Disk of Vishnu, is a circle. The name\r\n    denotes the circling, wheeling round, periodicity, the wheel of\r\n    time. This the god uses as a weapon to hurl at the enemy. In like\r\n    manner, Thor throws his weapon, the Fylfot, a form of the four‐\r\n    footed cross [Svastika], and a type of the four quarters. Thus the\r\n    cross is equivalent to the circle of the year. The wheel emblem\r\n    unites the cross and circle in one, as does the hieroglyphic cake\r\n    and the Ankh‐tie ☥.(1284)\r\n\r\n\r\nNor was the double glyph sacred with the profane, but only with the\r\nInitiates. For Raoul Rochette shows that:(1285)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The sign ♀ occurs as the _reverse_ of a Phœnician coin, with a Ram\r\n    as the obverse.... The same sign, sometimes called Venus’ Looking‐\r\n    Glass, because it typified reproduction, was employed to mark the\r\n    hind‐quarters of valuable brood mares of Corinthian and other\r\n    beautiful breeds of horses.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis proves that so far back as those early days the cross had already\r\nbecome the symbol of human procreation, and that oblivion of the _divine_\r\norigin of cross and circle had begun.\r\n\r\nAnother form of the cross is given from the _Journal of the Royal Asiatic\r\nSociety_:(1286)\r\n\r\n\r\n    At each of the four corners is placed a quarter arc of an oviform\r\n    curve, and when the four are put together they form an oval; thus\r\n    the figure combines the cross with the circle round it in four\r\n    parts, corresponding to the four corners of the cross. The four\r\n    segments answer to the four feet of the Swastica cross and the\r\n    Fylfot of Thor. The four‐leaved lotus flower of Buddha, is\r\n    likewise figured at the centre of this cross, the lotus being an\r\n    Egyptian and Hindu type of the four quarters. The four quarter\r\n    arcs, if joined together, would form an ellipse, and the ellipse\r\n    is also figured on each arm of the cross. This ellipse therefore\r\n    denotes the path of the earth.... Sir J. Y. Simpson copied the\r\n    following specimen, [Symbol: Oval, with large letter “Z” inside,\r\n    with horizontal crossbar] which is here presented, as the cross of\r\n    the two equinoxes and the two solstices placed within the figure\r\n    of the earth’s path. The same ovoid or boat‐shaped figure appears\r\n    at times in the Hindu drawings with seven steps at each end as a\r\n    form or a mode of Meru.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the astronomical aspect of the double glyph. There are six more\r\naspects, however, and an attempt may be made to interpret a few of these.\r\nThe subject is so vast that it would require in itself alone many volumes.\r\n\r\nBut the most curious of these Egyptian symbols of cross and circle, spoken\r\nof in the above cited work, is one which receives its full explanation and\r\nfinal colour from Âryan symbols of the same nature. Says the author:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The four‐armed Cross is simply the cross of the four quarters, but\r\n    the cross‐sign is not always simple.(1287) This is a type that was\r\n    developed from an identifiable beginning, which was adapted to the\r\n    expression of various ideas afterwards. The most sacred cross of\r\n    Egypt that was carried in the hands of the Gods, the Pharaohs, and\r\n    the mummied dead, is the Ankh ☥ the sign of life, the living, an\r\n    oath, the covenant.... The top of this is the hieroglyphic Ru\r\n    [Symbol: Horizontal oval] set upright on the Tau‐cross. The Ru is\r\n    the door, gate, mouth, the place of outlet. This denotes the\r\n    _birthplace_ in the northern quarter of the heavens, from which\r\n    the Sun is reborn. Hence the _Ru of the Ankh‐sign is the feminine\r\n    type of the birthplace, representing the north_. It was in the\r\n    _northern quarter_ that the Goddess of the Seven Stars, called the\r\n    “Mother of the Revolutions,” gave birth to time in the earliest\r\n    cycle of the year. The first sign of this primordial circle and\r\n    cycle made in heaven is the earliest shape of the Ankh‐cross\r\n    [Symbol: Horizontal oval with tail to the right], a mere loop\r\n    which contains both a circle and the cross in one image. This loop\r\n    or noose is carried in front of the oldest genitrix, _Typhon of\r\n    the Great Bear_; as her _Ark_, the ideograph of a _period_, _an\r\n    ending_, _a time_, shown to mean one revolution. This, then,\r\n    represents the circle made in the northern heaven by the Great\r\n    Bear which constituted the earliest year of time, from which fact\r\n    we infer that the loop or Ru of the North represents that quarter,\r\n    the birthplace of time when figured as the Ru of the Ankh symbol.\r\n    Indeed this can be proved. The noose is an _Ark_ or _Rek_ type of\r\n    reckoning. The Ru of the Ankh‐cross was continued in the Cypriote\r\n    R, [Symbol: Circle with horizontal line beneath], and the Coptic\r\n    Ro, [Symbol: Figure like a Rho].(1288) The Ro was carried into the\r\n    Greek cross [Symbol: Large Greek Rho with letter Chi beneath it],\r\n    which is formed of the Ro and Chi or _R‐k_.... The Rek, or Ark,\r\n    was the sign of all beginning (_Arche_) on this account, and the\r\n    Ark‐tie is the cross of the North, the hind part of heaven.(1289)\r\n\r\n\r\nNow this, again, is entirely astronomical and phallic. The Paurânic\r\nversion in India gives the whole matter another colour. Without destroying\r\nthe above interpretation, it is made to reveal a portion of its mysteries\r\nwith the help of the astronomical key, and thus offers a more metaphysical\r\nrendering. The Ankh‐tie [Symbol: Horizontal oval with tail to the right]\r\ndoes not belong to Egypt alone. It exists under the name of Pâsha, a cord\r\nwhich the four‐armed Shiva holds in the hand of his right back arm.(1290)\r\nThe Mahâdeva is represented in the posture of an ascetic, as Mahâyogî,\r\nwith his third eye [Symbol: Vertical oval with dot in the middle], which\r\nis “the Ru [Symbol: Horizontal oval with dot in the middle], set upright\r\non the Tau‐cross” in another form. The Pâsha is held in the hand in such a\r\nway that the first finger and hand near the thumb make the cross, or loop\r\nand crossing. Our Orientalists would have it to represent a cord to bind\r\nrefractory offenders with, because, forsooth, Kâlî, Shiva’s consort, has\r\nthe same as an attribute!\r\n\r\nThe Pâsha has here a double significance, as also has Shiva’s Trisûla and\r\nevery other divine attribute. This dual significance lies in Shiva, for\r\nRudra has certainly the same meaning as the Egyptian Ansated Cross in its\r\ncosmic and mystic meaning. In the hand of Shiva, the Pâsha becomes\r\nlingyonic. Shiva, as said before, is a name unknown to the _Vedas_. It is\r\nin the _White Yajur Veda_ that Rudra appears for the first time as the\r\nGreat God, Mahâdeva, whose symbol is the Lingam. In the _Rig Veda_ he is\r\ncalled Rudra, the “howler,” the beneficent and the maleficent Deity at the\r\nsame time, the Healer and the Destroyer. In the _Vishnu Purâna_, he is the\r\nGod who springs from the forehead of Brahmâ, who separates into male and\r\nfemale, and he is the parent of the Rudras or Maruts, half of whom are\r\nbrilliant and gentle, others, black and ferocious. In the _Vedas_, he is\r\nthe Divine Ego aspiring to return to its pure, deific state, and at the\r\nsame time that Divine Ego imprisoned in earthly form, whose fierce\r\npassions make of him the “roarer,” the “terrible.” This is well shown in\r\nthe _Brihadâranyaka Upanishad_, wherein the Rudras, the progeny of Rudra,\r\nGod of Fire, are called the “ten vital breaths (_prâna_, life), with the\r\nheart (_manas_), as eleventh,”(1291) whereas as Shiva, he is the\r\n_destroyer_ of that life. Brahmâ calls him Rudra, and gives him, besides,\r\nseven other names, signifying seven forms of manifestation, and also the\r\nseven powers of nature which destroy but to recreate or regenerate.\r\n\r\nHence the cruciform noose, or Pâsha, in the hand of Shiva, when he is\r\nrepresented as an ascetic, the Mahâyogin, has no phallic signification,\r\nand, indeed, it requires an imagination strongly bent in this direction to\r\nfind such a signification even in an astronomical symbol. As an emblem of\r\n“door, gate, mouth, the place of outlet” it signifies the “strait gate”\r\nthat leads to the Kingdom of Heaven, far more than the “birthplace” in a\r\nphysiological sense.\r\n\r\nIt is a cross in a circle and Crux Ansata, truly; but it is a cross on\r\nwhich all the human passions have to be crucified before the Yogî passes\r\nthrough the “strait gate,” the narrow circle that widens into an infinite\r\none, as soon as the Inner Man has passed the threshold.\r\n\r\nAs to the mysterious seven Rishis in the constellation of the Great Bear;\r\nif Egypt made them sacred to “the oldest genitrix, Typhon,” India has\r\nconnected these symbols ages ago with Time or Yuga‐revolutions, and the\r\nSaptarshis are intimately connected with our present age‐the dark Kali\r\nYuga.(1292) The great Circle of Time, on the face of which, Indian fancy\r\nhas represented the Porpoise, or Shishumâra, has the cross placed on it by\r\nnature in its division and localization of stars, planets and\r\nconstellations. In _Bhâgavata Purâna_,(1293) it is said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    At the _extremity of the tail of that animal, whose head is\r\n    directed toward the south_, and whose body is _in the shape of a\r\n    ring_ [circle], Dhruva [the ex‐pole star] is placed; _along its\r\n    tail_ are Prajâpati, Agni, Indra, Dharma, etc.; _across its loins_\r\n    the seven Rishis.(1294)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is then the first and earliest cross and circle, formed by the Deity,\r\nsymbolized by Vishnu, the Eternal Circle of Boundless Time, Kâla, on whose\r\nplane lie crossways all the Gods, creatures, and creations born in Space\r\nand Time‐who, as the Philosophy has it, all die at the Mahâpralaya.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile it is the seven Rishis who mark the time and the duration of\r\nevents in our septenary Life‐cycle. They are as mysterious as their\r\nsupposed wives, the Pleiades, of whom only one‐she who hides‐has proven\r\nvirtuous. The Pleiades, or Krittikâs, are the nurses of Kârttikeya, the\r\nGod of War (the Mars of the Western Pagans), who is called the Commander\r\nof the Celestial Armies, or rather of the Siddhas—Siddha‐sena (translated\r\nYogîs in Heaven, and holy Sages on the Earth)—which would make Kârttikeya\r\nidentical with Michael, the “Leader of the Celestial Hosts” and, like\r\nhimself, a virgin Kumâra.(1295) Verily he is the Guha, the “Mysterious\r\nOne,” as much so as are the Saptarshis and the Krittikâs, the seven Rishis\r\nand the Pleiades, for the interpretation of all these combined reveal to\r\nthe Adept the greatest mysteries of Occult Nature. One point is worth\r\nmention in this question of cross and circle, as it bears strongly upon\r\nthe elements of Fire and Water, which play such an important part in the\r\ncircle and cross symbolism. Like Mars, who is alleged by Ovid to have been\r\nborn of his mother Juno alone, without the participation of a father, or\r\nlike the Avatâras (Krishna, for instance)—in the West as in the\r\nEast—Kârttikeya is born, but in a still more miraculous manner, begotten\r\nby neither father nor mother, but out of a seed of Rudra‐Shiva, which was\r\ncast into the Fire (Agni) and then received by the Water (Ganges). Thus he\r\nis born from Fire and Water—a “boy bright as the Sun and beautiful as the\r\nMoon.” Hence he is called Agnibhû (son of Agni) and Gangâputra (son of\r\nGanges). Add to this the fact that the Krittikâ, his nurses, as the\r\n_Matsya Purâna_ shows, are presided over by Agni, or, in the authentic\r\nwords, “the seven Rishis are on a line with the brilliant Agni,” and hence\r\n“Krittika has Âgneya as a synonym”(1296)—and the connection is easy to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nIt is, then, the Rishis who mark the time and the periods of Kali Yuga,\r\nthe age of sin and sorrow. As the _Bhâgavata Purâna_ tells us:\r\n\r\n\r\n    When the splendour of Vishnu, named Krishna, departed for heaven,\r\n    then did the Kali age, during which men delight in sin, invade the\r\n    world....\r\n\r\n    When the seven Rishis were in Maghâ, the Kali age, comprising\r\n    1,200 [divine] years [432,000 common years] began; and, when, from\r\n    Maghâ, they shall reach Pûrvâshâdhâ, then will this Kali age\r\n    attain its growth, under Nanda and his successors.(1297)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the revolution of the Rishis—\r\n\r\n\r\n    When the two first stars of the seven Rishis (the Great Bear) rise\r\n    in the heavens, and some lunar asterism is seen at night, at an\r\n    equal distance between them, then the seven Rishis continue\r\n    stationary in that conjunction for a hundred years,\r\n\r\n\r\n—as a hater of Nanda makes Parâshara say. According to Bentley, it was in\r\norder to show the quantity of the precession of the equinoxes that this\r\nnotion originated among the Astronomers.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This was by assuming an imaginary line, or great circle, passing\r\n    through the poles of the ecliptic and the beginning of the fixed\r\n    Maghâ, which circle was supposed to cut some of the stars in the\r\n    Great Bear.... The seven stars in the Great Bear being called the\r\n    Rishis, the circle so assumed was called the line of the Rishis;\r\n    and, being invariably fixed to the beginning of the lunar asterism\r\n    Maghâ, the precession would be noted by stating the degree, etc.,\r\n    of any movable lunar mansion cut by that line or circle, as an\r\n    index.(1298)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere has been, and there still exists, a seemingly endless controversy\r\nabout the chronology of the Hindûs. Here is, however, a point that could\r\nhelp to determine—approximately at least—the age when the symbolism of the\r\nseven Rishis and their connection with the Pleiades began. When Kârttikeya\r\nwas delivered to the Krittikâ by the Gods to be nursed, they were only\r\nsix, whence Kârttikeya is represented with _six_ heads; but when the\r\npoetical fancy of the early Âryan Symbologists made of them the consorts\r\nof the seven Rishis, they were _seven_. Their names are given, and these\r\nare Amba, Dulâ, Nitatui, Abrayanti, Maghâyanti, Varshayanti, and\r\nChupunika. There are other sets of names which differ, however. Anyhow,\r\nthe seven Rishis were made to marry the seven Krittikâ before the\r\ndisappearance of the seventh Pleiad. Otherwise, how could the Hindû\r\nastronomers speak of a star which no one can see without the help of the\r\nstrongest telescopes? This is why, perhaps, in every such case the\r\nmajority of the events described in the Hindû allegories is fixed upon as\r\n“a very recent invention, certainly _within_ the Christian era.”\r\n\r\nThe oldest Sanskrit MSS. on Astronomy begin their series of Nakshatras,\r\nthe twenty‐seven lunar asterisms, with the sign of Krittikâ, and this can\r\nhardly make them earlier than 2,780 B.C. This is according to the “Vedic\r\nCalendar,” which is accepted even by the Orientalists, though they get out\r\nof the difficulty by saying that the said Calendar does not _prove_ that\r\nthe Hindûs knew anything of Astronomy at that date, and assure their\r\nreaders that, Calendars notwithstanding, the Indian Pandits may have\r\nacquired their knowledge of the lunar mansions headed by Krittikâ from the\r\nPhœnicians, etc. However that may be, the Pleiades are the central group\r\nof the system of sidereal symbology. They are situated in the neck of the\r\nconstellation Taurus, regarded by Mädler and others, in Astronomy, as the\r\n_central group_ of the system of the Milky Way, and in the _Kabalah_ and\r\nEastern Esotericism, as the _sidereal septenate_ born from the first\r\nmanifested side of the upper triangle, the concealed [triangle]. This\r\nmanifested side is Taurus, the symbol of One (the figure 1), or of the\r\nfirst letter of the Hebrew alphabet, Aleph (א) “bull” or “ox,” whose\r\nsynthesis is Ten (10), or Yod (י), the perfect letter and number. The\r\nPleiades (Alcyone, especially), are thus considered, even in Astronomy, as\r\nthe central point around which _our universe of fixed stars revolves_, the\r\nfocus from which, and into which, the Divine Breath, Motion, works\r\nincessantly during the Manvantara. Hence, in the sidereal symbols of the\r\nOccult Philosophy, it is this circle with the starry cross on its face\r\nwhich plays the most prominent part.\r\n\r\nThe Secret Doctrine teaches us that everything in the Universe, as well as\r\nthe Universe itself, is formed (“created”) during its periodical\r\nmanifestations—by accelerated Motion set into activity by the Breath of\r\nthe Ever‐to‐be‐unknown Power—unknown to present mankind, at any\r\nrate—within the phenomenal world. The Spirit of Life and Immortality was\r\neverywhere symbolized by a circle; hence the serpent biting its tail,\r\nrepresents the Circle of Wisdom in Infinity; as does the astronomical\r\ncross—the cross within a circle—and the globe, with two wings added to it,\r\nwhich then became the sacred Scarabæus of the Egyptians, its very name\r\nbeing suggestive of the secret idea attached to it. For the Scarabæus is\r\ncalled in the Egyptian papyri, Khopirron and Khopri from the verb\r\n_khopron_, “to become,” and has thus been made a symbol and an emblem of\r\nhuman life and of the successive “becomings” of man, through the various\r\nperegrinations and metempsychoses, or reïncarnations, of the liberated\r\nsoul. This mystical symbol shows plainly that the Egyptians believed in\r\nreïncarnation and the successive lives and existences of the Immortal\r\nEntity. As this, however, was an Esoteric Doctrine, revealed only during\r\nthe Mysteries, by the Priest‐hierophants and the King‐initiates to the\r\nCandidates, it was kept secret. The Incorporeal Intelligences (the\r\nPlanetary Spirits, or Creative Powers) were always represented under the\r\nform of circles. In the primitive Philosophy of the Hierophants these\r\n_invisible_ circles were the prototypic causes and builders of all the\r\nheavenly orbs, which were their _visible_ bodies or coverings, and of\r\nwhich they were the souls. It was certainly a universal teaching in\r\nantiquity.(1299) As Proclus says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Before the mathematical numbers, there are the _self‐moving_\r\n    numbers; before the figures apparent—the vital figures, and before\r\n    producing the material worlds _which move in a circle_, the\r\n    Creative Power produced the _invisible_ circles.(1300)\r\n\r\n\r\n“_Deus enim et circulus est_,” says Pherecydes, in his Hymn to Jupiter.\r\nThis was a Hermetic axiom, and Pythagoras prescribed such a circular\r\nprostration and posture during the hours of contemplation. “The devotee\r\nmust approach as much as possible the form of a perfect circle,”\r\nprescribes the Secret Book. Numa tried to spread the same custom among the\r\npeople, Pierius tells his readers; and Pliny says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    During our worship, we roll up, so to say, our body in a\r\n    ring—_totum corpus circumagimur_.(1301)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Vision of the prophet Ezekiel reminds one forcibly of this mysticism\r\nof the circle, when he beheld a “whirlwind” from which came out “one\r\n_wheel_ upon the earth” whose work “_was_ as it were a wheel in the middle\r\nof a wheel”—“for the spirit of the living creature _was_ in the\r\nwheels.”(1302)\r\n\r\n“[_Spirit_] whirleth about continually, and ... returneth again according\r\nto his circuits”—says Solomon,(1303) who is made in the English\r\n_translation_ to speak of the “wind,” and in the original text to refer\r\nboth to the _spirit_ and the _sun_. But the _Zohar_, the only true gloss\r\nof the Kabalistic Preacher—in explanation of this verse, which is,\r\nperhaps, rather hazy and difficult to comprehend—says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It seems to say that the sun moves in circuits, whereas it refers\r\n    to the Spirit _under the sun_, called the Holy Spirit, that moves\r\n    circularly, toward both sides, that they [It and the sun] _should\r\n    be united in the same Essence_.(1304)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Brâhmanical “Golden Egg,” from within which emerges Brahmâ, the\r\nCreative Deity, is the “Circle with the Central Point” of Pythagoras, and\r\nits fitting symbol. In the Secret Doctrine the concealed Unity—whether\r\nrepresenting Parabrahman, or the “Great Extreme” of Confucius, or the\r\nDeity concealed by Phtah, the Eternal Light, or again the Jewish Ain Suph,\r\nis always found to be symbolized by a circle or the “nought” (absolute No‐\r\nThing and Nothing, because it is Infinite and the All); while the God‐\r\nmanifested (by its works) is referred to as the Diameter of that Circle.\r\nThe symbolism of the underlying idea is thus made evident: the right line\r\npassing through the centre of a circle has, in the geometrical sense,\r\nlength, but neither breadth nor thickness; it is an imaginary and feminine\r\nsymbol, crossing eternity, and made to rest on the plane of existence _of\r\nthe phenomenal world_. It is _dimensional_, whereas its circle is\r\ndimensionless, or, to use an algebraical term, it is the dimension of an\r\nequation. Another way of symbolizing the idea is found in the Pythagorean\r\nsacred Decad which synthesizes, in the dual numeral Ten (the one and a\r\ncircle or cipher), the Absolute All manifesting itself in the Word or\r\nGenerative Power of Creation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB. The Fall Of The Cross Into Matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who would feel inclined to argue upon this Pythagorean symbol by\r\nobjecting that it is not yet ascertained, so far, at what period of\r\nantiquity the nought or cipher occurs for the first time—especially in\r\nIndia—are referred to _Isis Unveiled_.(1305)\r\n\r\nAdmitting for argument’s sake that the ancient world was not acquainted\r\nwith our modes of calculation or Arabic figures—though in reality we know\r\nit was—yet the circle and diameter idea is there to show that it was the\r\nfirst symbol in Cosmogony. Before the Trigrams of Fo‐hi, Yang, the unity,\r\nand Yin, the binary, explained cunningly enough by Éliphas Lévi,(1306)\r\nChina had her Confucius, and her Tao‐ists. The former circumscribes the\r\n“Great Extreme” within a circle with a horizontal line across; the latter\r\nplace three concentric circles beneath the great circle, while the Sung\r\nSages showed the “Great Extreme” in an upper circle, and Heaven and Earth\r\nin two lower and smaller circles. The Yangs and the Yins are a far later\r\ninvention. Plato and his school never understood the Deity otherwise,\r\nnotwithstanding the many epithets applied by him to the “God over all” (ὁ\r\nἐπὶ πᾶσι θεός). Plato, having been initiated, could not believe in a\r\npersonal God—a gigantic shadow of man. His epithets of “Monarch” and “Law‐\r\ngiver of the Universe” bear an abstract meaning well understood by every\r\nOccultist, who, no less than any Christian, believes in the One Law that\r\ngoverns the Universe, and recognizes it at the same time as immutable. As\r\nPlato says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Beyond all _finite_ existences and _secondary_ causes, all laws,\r\n    ideas and principles, there is an Intelligence or Mind (νοῦς), the\r\n    first principle of all principles, the Supreme Idea on which all\r\n    other ideas are grounded, ... the _ultimate_ substance _from which\r\n    all things derive their being and essence_, the First and\r\n    efficient Cause of all the order, and harmony, and beauty and\r\n    excellency, and goodness, which pervade the Universe.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Mind is called, by way of preëminence and excellence, the Supreme\r\nGood,(1307) “The God” (ὁ θεός), and the “God over all.” These words apply,\r\nas Plato himself shows, neither to the “Creator” nor to the “Father” of\r\nour modern Monotheist, but to the _Ideal_ and Abstract Cause. For, as he\r\nsays: “This θεός, the God over all, _is not the truth or the\r\nintelligence_, but the Father of it,” and its Primal Cause. Is it Plato,\r\nthe greatest pupil of the archaic Sages, a Sage himself, for whom there\r\nwas but a single object of attainment in this life—Real Knowledge—who\r\nwould have ever believed in a Deity that curses and damns men for ever, on\r\nthe slightest provocation?(1308) Surely not he who considered only those\r\nto be genuine Philosophers and students of truth who possessed the\r\nknowledge of the _really‐existing_ in opposition to mere seeming; of the\r\n_always‐existing_ in opposition to the transitory: and of that which\r\nexists _permanently_ in opposition to that which waxes, wanes, and is\r\ndeveloped and destroyed alternately.(1309) Speusippus and Xenocrates\r\nfollowed in his footsteps. The One, the original, had no _existence_, in\r\nthe sense applied to it by mortal men. The τίμιον (the honoured) dwells in\r\nthe centre as in the circumference, but it is only _the reflection_ of the\r\nDeity—the World Soul(1310)—the plane of the surface of the circle. The\r\ncross and circle are a universal conception—as old as the human mind\r\nitself. They stand foremost on the list of the long series of, so to say,\r\ninternational symbols, which expressed very often great scientific truths,\r\nbesides their direct bearing upon psychological, and even physiological\r\nmysteries.\r\n\r\nIt is no explanation to say, as does Éliphas Lévi, that God, the universal\r\nLove, having caused the male Unit to dig an abyss in the female Binary, or\r\nChaos, thereby produced the world. In addition to the grossness of the\r\nconception, it does not remove the difficulty of conceiving it without\r\nlosing one’s veneration for the rather too human‐like ways of the Deity.\r\nIt is to avoid such anthropomorphic conceptions that the Initiates never\r\nused the epithet “God” to designate the One and Secondless Principle in\r\nthe Universe; and that—faithful in this to the oldest traditions of the\r\nSecret Doctrine the world over—they deny that such imperfect and often not\r\nvery clean work could ever be produced by Absolute Perfection. There is no\r\nneed to mention here other still greater metaphysical difficulties.\r\nBetween speculative Atheism and idiotic Anthropomorphism there must be a\r\nphilosophical mean, and a reconciliation. The Presence of the Unseen\r\nPrinciple throughout all Nature, and the highest manifestation of it on\r\nEarth—Man, can alone help to solve the problem, which is that of the\r\nmathematician whose _x_ must ever elude the grasp of our terrestrial\r\nalgebra. The Hindûs have tried to solve it by their Avatâras, the\r\nChristians _think_ they have done so—by their one divine Incarnation.\r\nExoterically—both are wrong; Esoterically both of them are very near the\r\ntruth. Alone, among the Apostles of the Western religion, Paul seems to\r\nhave fathomed—if not actually revealed—the archaic mystery of the cross.\r\nAs for the rest of those who, by unifying and individualizing the\r\nUniversal Presence, have synthesized it into one symbol—the central point\r\nin the crucifix—they show thereby that they have never seized the true\r\nspirit of the teaching of Christ, but rather that they have degraded it in\r\nmore than one way by their erroneous interpretations. They have forgotten\r\nthe spirit of that universal symbol and have selfishly monopolized it—as\r\nthough the Boundless and the Infinite could ever be limited and\r\nconditioned to one manifestation individualized in one man, or even in a\r\nnation!\r\n\r\nThe four arms of the [Symbol: cross like the letter “X”], or decussated\r\ncross, and of the Hermetic cross, pointing to the four cardinal\r\npoints—were well understood by the mystical minds of the Hindûs, Brâhmans\r\nand Buddhists, hundreds of years before it was heard of in Europe, for\r\nthat symbol was and is found all over the world. They bent the ends of the\r\ncross and made of it their Svastika, 卐 now the Wan of the Mongolian\r\nBuddhist.(1311) It implies that the “central point” is not limited to one\r\nindividual, however perfect; that The Principle (God) is in Humanity, and\r\nHumanity, as all the rest, is in It, like drops of water are in the ocean,\r\nthe four ends being toward the four cardinal points, hence losing\r\nthemselves in infinity.\r\n\r\nIsarim, an Initiate, is said to have found at Hebron, on the _dead body_\r\nof Hermes, the well known Smaragdine Tablet, which, it is said, contained\r\nthe essence of Hermetic Wisdom. Upon it were traced, among others, the\r\nsentences:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Separate the earth from the fire, the subtile from the gross....\r\n\r\n    Ascend ... from the earth to heaven and then descend again to\r\n    earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _riddle_ of the cross is contained in these words, and its double\r\nmystery is solved—to the Occultist.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The philosophical cross, the two lines running in opposite\r\n    directions, the horizontal and the perpendicular, the height and\r\n    breadth, which the geometrizing Deity divides at the intersecting\r\n    point, and which forms the magical as well as the scientific\r\n    quaternary, when it is inscribed within the perfect square, is the\r\n    basis of the Occultist. Within its mystical precinct lies the\r\n    master‐key which opens the door of every science, physical as well\r\n    as spiritual. It symbolizes our human existence, for the circle of\r\n    life circumscribes the four points of the cross, which represent\r\n    in succession, birth, life, death, and _immortality_.(1312)\r\n\r\n    “Attach thyself,” says the Alchemist, “to the four letters of the\r\n    tetragram disposed in the following manner. The letters of the\r\n    ineffable name are there, although thou mayest not discern them at\r\n    first. The incommunicable axiom is kabalistically contained\r\n    therein, and this is what is called the magic arcanum by the\r\n    masters.”(1313)\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Tau, Τ, and the astronomical cross of Egypt, [Symbol: Circle\r\n    with cross within] are conspicuous in several apertures of the\r\n    remains of Palenque. In one of the _basso‐relievos_ of the Palace\r\n    of Palenque, on the west side, sculptured as a hieroglyphic right\r\n    under the seated figure, is a Tau. The standing figure, which\r\n    leans over the first one, is in the act of covering its head with\r\n    the left hand with the veil of initiation; while it extends its\r\n    right with the index and middle finger pointing to heaven. The\r\n    position is precisely that of a Christian bishop giving his\r\n    blessing, or the one in which Jesus is often represented while at\r\n    the Last Supper.(1314)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian Hierophant had a square head‐dress which he had to wear\r\nalways during his functions. These square hats are worn unto this day by\r\nthe Armenian priests. The perfect Tau—formed of the perpendicular\r\n(descending male ray) and the horizontal line (Matter, female\r\nprinciple)—and the mundane circle were attributes of Isis, and it was only\r\nat death that the Egyptian cross was laid on the breast of the mummy. The\r\nclaim that the cross is purely a Christian symbol introduced after our\r\nera, is strange indeed, when we find Ezekiel stamping the foreheads of the\r\nmen of Judah who feared the Lord,(1315) with the _signum Thau_, as it is\r\ntranslated in the Vulgate. In the ancient Hebrew this sign was formed thus\r\n[Symbol: Cross, tilted towards the northeast], but in the original\r\nEgyptian hieroglyphics as a perfect Christian cross ☦ (Tat, the emblem of\r\nstability). In the _Revelation_, also, the “Alpha and Omega”—Spirit and\r\nMatter—the first and the last, stamps the name of his Father on the\r\nforeheads of the _elect_. Moses(1316) orders his people to mark their\r\n_door‐posts_ and _lintels_ with blood, lest the “Lord God” should make a\r\nmistake and smite some of his chosen people, instead of the doomed\r\nEgyptians. And this mark is a Tau!—the identical Egyptian handled cross,\r\nwith the half of which talisman Horus raised the dead, as is shown on a\r\nsculptured ruin at Philæ.\r\n\r\nEnough has been said in the text about the Svastika and the Tau. Verily\r\nmay the cross be traced back into the very depths of the unfathomable\r\narchaic ages! Its mystery deepens rather than clears, as we find it on the\r\nstatues of Easter Island, in old Egypt, in Central Asia, engraved on rocks\r\nas the Tau and Svastika, in Pre‐Christian Scandinavia, everywhere! The\r\nauthor of the _Source of Measures_ stands perplexed before the endless\r\nshadow it throws back into antiquity, and is unable to trace it to any\r\nparticular nation or man. He shows the Targums handed down by the Hebrews,\r\nobscured by translation. In _Joshua_(1317) read in Arabic, and in the\r\n_Targum of Jonathan_, it is said: “The king of Ai he _crucified_ upon a\r\ntree.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Septuagint rendering is of suspension from a _double word_ or\r\n    _cross_. (Wordsworth on Joshua.) ... The strangest expression of\r\n    this kind is in _Numbers_ (xxv. 4) where, by Onkelos (?) it is\r\n    read: “_Crucify them before the Lord (Jehovah) against the sun_.”\r\n    The word here is יקע, _to nail to_, rendered properly (Fuerst) by\r\n    the Vulgate, _to crucify_. The very construction of this sentence\r\n    is mystic.(1318)\r\n\r\n\r\nSo it is, but the spirit of it has been ever misunderstood. “To crucify\r\nbefore (not against) the Sun” is a phrase used of Initiation. It comes\r\nfrom Egypt, and primarily from India. The enigma can be unriddled only by\r\nsearching for its key in the Mysteries of Initiation. The Initiated Adept,\r\nwho had successfully passed through all the trials, was _attached_, not\r\n_nailed_, but simply tied on a couch in the form of a Tau, Τ, in Egypt, of\r\na Svastika without the four additional prolongations (☩ not 卐) in India,\r\nplunged in a deep sleep—the “Sleep of Siloam,” as it is called to this day\r\namong the Initiates in Asia Minor, in Syria, and even higher Egypt. He was\r\nallowed to remain in this state for three days and three nights, during\r\nwhich time his Spiritual Ego was said to “confabulate” with the “Gods,”\r\ndescend into Hades, Amenti, or Pâtâla—according to the country—and do\r\nworks of charity to the invisible Beings, whether Souls of men or\r\nElemental Spirits; his body remaining all the time in a temple crypt or\r\nsubterranean cave. In Egypt it was placed in the Sarcophagus in the King’s\r\nChamber of the Pyramid of Cheops, and carried during the night of the\r\napproaching third day to the entrance of a gallery, where at a certain\r\nhour the beams of the rising Sun struck full on the face of the entranced\r\nCandidate, who awoke to be initiated by Osiris and Thoth, the God of\r\nWisdom.\r\n\r\nLet the reader who doubts the statement consult the Hebrew originals\r\nbefore he denies. Let him turn to some most suggestive Egyptian _bas\r\nreliefs_. One especially from the temple of Philæ, represents a _scene of\r\ninitiation_. Two God‐Hierophants, one with the head of a hawk (the Sun),\r\nthe other ibis‐headed (Mercury, Thoth, the God of Wisdom and Secret\r\nLearning, the assessor of Osiris‐Sun), are standing over the body of a\r\nCandidate just initiated. They are in the act of pouring on his head a\r\ndouble stream of “water” (the Water of Life and of New‐birth), the streams\r\nbeing interlaced in the shape of a cross and full of small ansated\r\ncrosses. This is allegorical of the awakening of the Candidate who is now\r\nan Initiate, when the beams of the morning Sun, Osiris, strike the crown\r\nof his head; his entranced body being placed on its wooden Tau so as to\r\nreceive the rays. Then appeared the Hierophant‐Initiators, and the\r\nsacramental words were pronounced, ostensibly to the Sun‐Osiris, in\r\nreality to the Spirit‐Sun within, enlightening the newly‐born man.\r\n\r\nLet the reader meditate on the connection of the Sun with the cross from\r\nthe highest antiquity, in both its generative and spiritually regenerative\r\ncapacities. Let him examine the tomb of Bait‐Oxly, in the reign of Ramses\r\nII, where he will find the crosses in every shape and position; as also on\r\nthe throne of that sovereign, and finally on a fragment representing the\r\nadoration of Bakhan‐Alearé, from the Hall of the ancestors of Totmes III,\r\nnow preserved in the National Library of Paris. In this extraordinary\r\nsculpture and painting one sees the disk of the Sun beaming upon an\r\nansated cross placed upon a cross of which those of the Calvary are\r\nperfect copies. The ancient MSS. mention these as the “hard couches of\r\nthose who were in [spiritual] travail, the _act of giving birth to\r\nthemselves_.” A quantity of such cruciform “couches,” on which the\r\nCandidate, thrown into a dead trance at the end of his supreme Initiation,\r\nwas placed and secured, were found in the underground halls of the\r\nEgyptian Temples after their destruction. The worthy and holy Fathers of\r\nthe Cyril and Theophilus types used them freely, believing they had been\r\nbrought and concealed there by some new converts. Alone Origen, and after\r\nhim Clemens Alexandrinus and other ex‐initiates, knew better. But they\r\npreferred to keep silent.\r\n\r\nAgain, let the reader read the Hindû “fables,” as the Orientalists call\r\nthem, and remember the allegory of Vishvakarmâ, the Creative Power, the\r\nGreat Architect of the World, called in the _Rig Veda_ the “All‐seeing\r\nGod,” who “sacrifices himself to himself.” The Spiritual Egos of mortals\r\nare his own essence, _one with him_, therefore. Remember that he is called\r\nDeva‐vardhika, the “Builder of the Gods,” and that it is he who ties the\r\nSun, Sûrya, his son‐in‐law, on his lathe—in the exoteric allegory, but on\r\nthe Svastika, in Esoteric tradition, for on Earth he is the Hierophant‐\r\nInitiator—and cuts away a portion of his brightness. Vishvakarmâ, remember\r\nagain, is the son of Yoga‐siddhâ, _i.e._, the holy power of Yoga, and the\r\nfabricator of the “fiery weapon,” the magic Agneyastra.(1319) The\r\nnarrative is given more fully elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe author of the kabalistic work so often quoted from, asks:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The theoretical use of crucifixion then, must have been somehow\r\n    connected with the personification of this symbol [the structure\r\n    of the Garden of Paradise symbolized by a crucified man]. But how?\r\n    And as showing what? The symbol was of the origin of measures,\r\n    shadowing forth _creative law_ or _design_. What, practically, as\r\n    regards humanity, could actual crucifixion betoken? Yet, that it\r\n    was held as the effigy of some mysterious working of the same\r\n    system, is shown from the very fact of the use. There seems to be\r\n    deep below deep as to the mysterious workings of these number\r\n    values—[the symbolization of the connection of 113: 355, with\r\n    20612: 6561, by a _crucified man_]. Not only are they shown to\r\n    work in the cosmos but, ... by sympathy, they seem to work out\r\n    conditions relating to an unseen and spiritual world, and the\r\n    prophets seem to have held knowledge of the connecting links.\r\n    Reflection becomes more involved when it is considered that, the\r\n    power of expression of the law, _exactly_, by numbers clearly\r\n    defining a system, was not the _accident_ of the language, but was\r\n    its very _essence_, and of its _primary organic construction_;\r\n    therefore, neither the language, nor the mathematical system\r\n    attaching to it, could be of man’s invention, unless both were\r\n    _founded upon a prior language which afterwards became\r\n    obsolete_.(1320)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author proves these points by further elucidation, and reveals the\r\nsecret meaning of more than one dead‐letter narrative, by showing that\r\nprobably, איש, _man_, was the _primordial_ word:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The very first word possessed by the Hebrews, whoever they were,\r\n    to carry the idea, by sound, of _a man_. The _essential_ of this\r\n    word was 113 [the numerical value of that word] from the\r\n    beginning, and carried with it the elements of the cosmical system\r\n    displayed.(1321)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is demonstrated by the Hindû Vittoba, a form of Vishnu, as has\r\nalready been stated. The figure of Vittoba, even to the nail‐marks on the\r\nfeet,(1322) is that of _Jesus crucified_, in all its details save the\r\ncross. That _man_ was meant is proved to us further by the fact of the\r\nInitiate being _reborn_ after his _crucifixion_ on the _Tree of Life_.\r\nThis “Tree” has now become exoterically—through its use by the Romans as\r\nan instrument of torture and the ignorance of the early Christian\r\nschemers—the _tree of death_!\r\n\r\nThus, one of the seven Esoteric meanings intended by this mystery of\r\ncrucifixion by the mystic inventors of the system—the original elaboration\r\nand adoption of which dates back to the very establishment of the\r\nMysteries—is discovered in the geometrical symbols containing the history\r\nof the evolution of man. The Hebrews—whose prophet Moses was so learned in\r\nthe Esoteric Wisdom of Egypt, and who adopted their numerical system from\r\nthe Phœnicians, and later from the Gentiles, from whom also they borrowed\r\nmost of their Kabalistic Mysticism—most ingeniously adapted the cosmic and\r\nanthropological symbols of the “Heathen” nations to their peculiar\r\n_secret_ records. If Christian sacerdotalism has lost the key of this to‐\r\nday, the early compilers of the Christian Mysteries were well versed in\r\nEsoteric Philosophy and the Hebrew Occult Metrology, and used it\r\ndexterously. Thus they took the word Aish, one of the Hebrew word‐forms\r\nfor _man_, and used it in conjunction with that of Shânâh or _lunar year_,\r\nso mystically connected with the name of Jehovah, the supposed “Father” of\r\nJesus, and embosomed the mystic idea in an astronomical value and formula.\r\n\r\nThe original idea of the “man crucified” in space certainly belongs to the\r\nancient Hindûs. Moor shows this in his _Hindû Pantheon_ in the engraving\r\nthat represents Vittoba. Plato adopted it in his decussated cross in\r\nspace, the [Symbol: cross like the letter “X”], the “second God who\r\nimpressed himself on the universe in the form of the cross”; Krishna is\r\nlikewise shown “crucified.”(1323) Again it is repeated in the _Old\r\nTestament_ in the queer injunction to crucify men before the Lord, the\r\nSun—which is no prophecy at all, but has a direct phallic significance. In\r\nthat same most suggestive work on the kabalistic meanings, we read again:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In symbol, the nails of the cross have for the shape of the heads\r\n    thereof a solid pyramid, and a tapering square obeliscal shaft, or\r\n    phallic emblem, for the nail. Taking the position of the _three_\r\n    nails in the man’s extremities and on the cross, they form or mark\r\n    a _triangle_ in shape, one nail being at each corner of the\r\n    triangle. The wounds, or _stigmata_, in the extremities are\r\n    necessarily _four_, designative of the _square_.... The three\r\n    nails with the three wounds are in number 6, which denotes the 6\r\n    faces of the cube _unfolded_ [which make the cross or man‐form, or\r\n    7, counting three horizontal and four vertical squares], on which\r\n    the man is placed; and this in turn points to the circular measure\r\n    transferred on to the edges of the cube. The _one_ wound of the\r\n    feet separates into _two_ when the feet are separated, making\r\n    _three_ together _for all_, and _four when separated_, or 7 in\r\n    all—another and _most holy_ [_with the Jews_] feminine base\r\n    number.(1324)\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, while the phallic or sexual meaning of the “crucifixion nails” is\r\nproven by the geometrical and numerical reading, its mystical meaning is\r\nindicated by the short remarks upon it, as given above, in its connection\r\nwith, and bearing upon, Prometheus. He is another victim, for he is\r\ncrucified on the Cross of Love, on the rock of human passions, a sacrifice\r\nto his devotion to the cause of the spiritual element in Humanity.\r\n\r\nNow, the primordial system, the double glyph that underlies the idea of\r\nthe cross, is not of “human invention,” for Cosmic Ideation and the\r\nspiritual representation of the Divine Ego‐man are at its basis. Later, it\r\nexpanded into the beautiful idea adopted by, and represented in, the\r\nMysteries, that of regenerated man, the mortal, who, by crucifying the man\r\nof flesh and his passions on the Procrustean bed of torture, became reborn\r\nas an Immortal. Leaving the body, the animal‐man, behind him, tied on the\r\nCross of Initiation like an empty chrysalis, the Ego‐Soul became as free\r\nas a butterfly. Still later, owing to the gradual loss of spirituality,\r\nthe cross became in Cosmogony and Anthropology no higher than a _phallic\r\nsymbol_.\r\n\r\nWith the Esotericists from the remotest times, the Universal Soul or Anima\r\nMundi, the material reflection of the Immaterial Ideal, was the Source of\r\nLife of all beings and of the Life‐Principle of the three kingdoms. This\r\nwas _septenary_ with the Hermetic Philosophers, as with all Ancients. For\r\nit is represented as a sevenfold cross, whose branches are respectively,\r\n_light_, _heat_, _electricity_, _terrestrial magnetism_, _astral\r\nradiation_, _motion_, and _intelligence_, or what some call self‐\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\nAs we have said elsewhere, long before the cross or its sign were adopted\r\nas symbols of Christianity, the sign of the cross was used as a mark of\r\nrecognition among Adepts and Neophytes, the latter being called\r\nChrests—from Chrestos, the man of tribulation and sorrow. Says Éliphas\r\nLévi:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The sign of the cross adopted by the Christians does not belong to\r\n    them exclusively. It is also kabalistic, and represents the\r\n    opposition and quaternary equilibrium of the elements. We see by\r\n    the occult verse of the _Paternoster_ ... that there were\r\n    originally two ways of doing it, or, at least _two_ very different\r\n    formulas to express its meaning: one reserved for the priests and\r\n    initiates; the other given to neophytes and the profane. Thus, for\r\n    example, the initiate, carrying his hand to his forehead, said,\r\n    _To thee_; then he added, _belong_; and continued, carrying his\r\n    hand to the breast, _the kingdom_; then to the left shoulder,\r\n    _justice_; to the right shoulder, _and mercy_. Then he joined the\r\n    two hands, adding, _throughout the generating cycles—Tibi sunt\r\n    Malchut et Geburah et Chesed per Æonas_—an absolutely and\r\n    magnificently kabalistic sign of the cross, which the profanations\r\n    of Gnosticism made the militant and official Church completely\r\n    _lose_.(1325)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “militant and official Church” did more: having helped herself to what\r\nhad never belonged to her, she took only that which the “Profane” had—the\r\nkabalistic meaning of the _male_ and _female_ Sephiroth. She never lost\r\nthe _inner_ and higher meaning since she never had it—Éliphas Lévi’s\r\npandering to Rome notwithstanding. The sign of the cross adopted by the\r\nLatin Church was _phallic_ from the beginning, while that of the Greeks\r\nwas the cross of the Neophytes, the Chrestoi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection IX. The Upanishads in Gnostic Literature.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are reminded in King’s _Gnostics and their Remains_ that the Greek\r\nlanguage had but one word for _vowel_ and _voice_. This has led the\r\nuninitiated to many erroneous interpretations. On the simple knowledge,\r\nhowever, of this well‐known fact a comparison may be attempted, and a\r\nflood of light thrown upon several mystic meanings. Thus the words, so\r\noften used in the _Upanishads_ and the _Purânas_, “Sound” and “Speech,”\r\nmay be collated with the Gnostic “Vowels” and the “Voices” of the Thunders\r\nand Angels in _Revelation_. The same will be found in _Pistis Sophia_, and\r\nother ancient Fragments and MSS. This was remarked even by the matter‐of‐\r\nfact author of the above mentioned work.\r\n\r\nThrough Hippolytus, an early Church Father, we learn what Marcus—a\r\nPythagorean rather than a Christian Gnostic, and a Kabalist most\r\ncertainly—had received in mystic revelation. It is said that Marcus had it\r\nrevealed unto him that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The _seven heavens_(1326) ... sounded each one vowel, which, all\r\n    combined together, formed a single doxology, “the _sound_ whereof\r\n    being carried down [from these seven heavens] to earth, becomes\r\n    the creator and parent of all things that be on earth.”(1327)\r\n\r\n\r\nTranslated from the Occult phraseology into still plainer language this\r\nwould read: The Sevenfold Logos having differentiated into seven Logoi, or\r\nCreative Potencies (Vowels), these (the Second Logos, or “Sound”) created\r\nall on Earth.\r\n\r\nAssuredly one who is acquainted with Gnostic literature can hardly help\r\nseeing in St. John’s _Apocalypse_, a work of the same school of thought.\r\nFor we find John saying:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Seven thunders uttered their voices ... [and] I was about to write\r\n    ... [but] I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up\r\n    those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them\r\n    not.(1328)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same injunction is given to Marcus, the same to all other _semi_ and\r\n_full_ Initiates. The very sameness of the expressions used, and of the\r\nunderlying ideas, always betrays a portion of the Mysteries. We must\r\nalways seek for more than one meaning in every mystery allegorically\r\nrevealed, especially in those in which the number seven and its\r\nmultiplication seven by seven, or forty‐nine, appear. Now when, in _Pistis\r\nSophia_, the Rabbi Jesus is requested by his disciples to reveal to them\r\nthe “Mysteries of the Light of his Father”—_i.e._, of the Higher Self\r\nenlightened by Initiation and Divine Knowledge—Jesus answers:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Do ye seek after these mysteries? No mystery is more excellent\r\n    than they; which shall bring your souls unto the Light of Lights,\r\n    unto the place of Truth and Goodness, unto the place where there\r\n    is neither male nor female, neither form in that place but Light,\r\n    everlasting, not to be uttered. Nothing therefore is more\r\n    excellent than the mysteries which ye seek after, _saving only the\r\n    mystery of the seven Vowels and their forty and nine Powers_, and\r\n    their numbers thereof. And no name is more excellent than all\r\n    these (Vowels).(1329)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs says the Commentary, speaking of the “Fires”:\r\n\r\n_The Seven Fathers and the Forty‐nine Sons blaze in Darkness, but they are\r\nthe Life and Light and the continuation thereof through the Great Age._\r\n\r\nNow it becomes evident that, in every Esoteric interpretation of exoteric\r\nbeliefs expressed in allegorical forms, there is the same underlying\r\nidea—the basic number _seven_, the compound of _three_ and _four_,\r\npreceded by the divine _three_ ([triangle]) making the perfect number\r\n_ten_.\r\n\r\nAlso, these numbers apply equally to divisions of time, to cosmography,\r\nmetaphysical and physical, as well as to man and everything else in\r\nvisible Nature. Thus these seven Vowels with their forty‐nine Powers are\r\nidentical with the three and the seven Fires of the Hindûs and their\r\nforty‐nine Fires; identical with the numerical mysteries of the Persian\r\nSimorgh; identical with those of the Jewish Kabalists. The latter,\r\ndwarfing the numbers (their mode of “blinds”), made the duration of each\r\nsuccessive Renewal, or what we call in Esoteric parlance Round, 1,000\r\nyears only or of the seven Renewals of the Globe 7,000 years, instead of,\r\nas is more likely, 7,000,000,000, and assigned to the total duration of\r\nthe Universe 49,000 years only.(1330)\r\n\r\nNow, the Secret Doctrine furnishes a key which reveals to us on the\r\nIndisputable grounds of comparative analogy that Garuda, the allegorical\r\nand monstrous half‐man and half‐bird—the Vâhana or vehicle on which\r\nVishnu, as Kâla or “Time,” is shown to ride—is the origin of all such\r\nallegories. He is the Indian Phœnix, the emblem of cyclic and periodical\r\ntime, the “Man‐lion” (Sinha), of whose representations the so‐called\r\nGnostic gems are so full.(1331)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Over the seven rays of the lion’s crown, and corresponding to\r\n    their points, stand often the seven vowels of the Greek alphabet,\r\n    ΑΕΗΙΟΥΩ, testifying to the Seven Heavens.(1332)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the Solar Lion and the emblem of the Solar Cycle, as Garuda(1333)\r\nis that of the Great Cycle, the Mahâ Kalpa, coëternal with Vishnu, and\r\nalso, of course, the emblem of the Sun and Solar Cycle. This is shown by\r\nthe details of the allegory. At his birth, Garuda, on account of his\r\n“dazzling splendour,” is mistaken for Agni, the God of Fire, and was\r\nthence called Gaganeshvara, “Lord of the Sky.” Its representation as\r\nOsiris, on the Abraxas (Gnostic) gems, and by many heads of allegorical\r\nmonsters, with the head and beak of an eagle or a hawk—both solar\r\nbirds—denotes Garuda’s solar and cyclic character. His son is Jatâyu, the\r\ncycle of 60,000 years. As well remarked by C. W. King:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Whatever its primary meaning [of the gem with the solar lion and\r\n    vowels] it was probably imported in its present shape from India\r\n    (that true fountain head of Gnostic iconography).(1334)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mysteries of the seven Gnostic Vowels, uttered by the Thunders of St.\r\nJohn, can be unriddled only by the primeval and original Occultism of\r\nÂryâvarta, brought into India by the primeval Brâhmans, who had been\r\n_initiated in Central Asia_. And this is the Occultism we study and try to\r\nexplain, as much as is possible, in these pages. Our doctrine of seven\r\nRaces, and seven Rounds of life and evolution around our Terrestrial Chain\r\nof Spheres, may be found even in _Revelation_.(1335) When the seven\r\n“Thunders,” or “Sounds,” or “Vowels”—one meaning out of the seven for each\r\nsuch vowel relates directly to our own Earth and its seven Root‐Races in\r\neach Round—“had uttered their voices,” but had forbidden the Seer to write\r\nthem, and made him “seal up those things,” what did the Angel, “standing\r\nupon the sea and upon the earth,” do?\r\n\r\n\r\n    He lifted up his hand to heaven, and sware by him that liveth for\r\n    ever and ever, ... that there _should be time no longer_: but in\r\n    the days of the voice of the _seventh_ angel, when he shall begin\r\n    to sound, the mystery of God [of the Cycle] should be\r\n    finished.(1336)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis means, in Theosophic phraseology, that when the Seventh Round is\r\ncompleted, then Time will cease. “There shall be time no longer”—very\r\nnaturally, since Pralaya shall set in and there will remain no one on\r\nEarth to keep a division of time, during that periodical dissolution and\r\narrest of conscious life.\r\n\r\nDr. Kenealy and others believed that the calculations of the cyclic seven\r\nand forty‐nine were brought by the Rabbins from Chaldæa. This is more than\r\nlikely. But the Babylonians, who had all those cycles and taught them only\r\nat their great initiatory mysteries of astrological Magic, got their\r\nwisdom and learning from India. It is not difficult, therefore, to\r\nrecognize in them our own Esoteric Doctrine. In their secret computations,\r\nthe Japanese have the same figures in their cycles. As to the Brâhmans,\r\ntheir _Purânas_ and _Upanishads_ are good proof of it. The latter have\r\npassed entirely into Gnostic literature; and a Brâhman needs only to read\r\n_Pistis Sophia_(1337) to recognize his forefathers’ property, even to the\r\nphraseology and similes used. Let us compare. In _Pistis Sophia_ the\r\ndisciples say to Jesus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Rabbi, reveal unto us the mysteries of the Light [_i.e._, the\r\n    “Fire of Knowledge or Enlightenment”], ... forasmuch as we have\r\n    heard thee saying that there is another baptism of _smoke_, and\r\n    another baptism of the Spirit of Holy Light [_i.e._ the Spirit of\r\n    Fire].(1338)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs John says of Jesus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I indeed baptize you with water; ... but he shall baptize you with\r\n    the Holy Ghost and with fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe real significance of this statement is very profound. It means that\r\nJohn, a non‐initiated ascetic, can impart to his disciples no greater\r\nwisdom than the Mysteries connected with the plane of Matter, of which\r\nWater is the symbol. His Gnosis was that of exoteric and ritualistic\r\ndogma, of dead‐letter orthodoxy;(1339) while the wisdom which Jesus, an\r\nInitiate of the Higher Mysteries, would reveal to them, was of a higher\r\ncharacter, for it was the “Fire” Wisdom of the true Gnosis or _real_\r\nSpiritual Enlightenment. One was Fire, the other the Smoke. For Moses, the\r\nFire on Mount Sinai and the Spiritual Wisdom; for the multitudes of the\r\n“people” below, for the profane, Mount Sinai in (through) Smoke, _i.e._,\r\nthe exoteric husks of orthodox or sectarian ritualism.\r\n\r\nNow, having the above in view, read the dialogue between the sages Nârada\r\nand Devamata in the _Anugîtâ_,(1340) an episode from the _Mahâbhârata_,\r\nthe antiquity and importance of which one can learn in the “Sacred Books\r\nof the East,” edited by Prof. Max Müller.(1341) Nârada is discoursing upon\r\nthe “breaths” or the “life‐winds,” as they are called in the clumsy\r\ntranslations of such words as Prâna, Apâna, etc., whose full Esoteric\r\nmeaning and application to individual functions can hardly be rendered in\r\nEnglish. He says of this science that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is the teaching of the Veda, that the _fire_ verily is all the\r\n    deities, and knowledge (of it) arises among Brâhmanas, being\r\n    accompanied by intelligence.(1342)\r\n\r\n\r\nBy “fire,” says the Commentator, he means the Self. By “intelligence,” the\r\nOccultist says, Nârada meant neither “discussion” nor “argumentation,” as\r\nArjuna Mishra believes, but “intelligence” truly, or the adaptation of the\r\n_Fire of Wisdom_ to _exoteric ritualism_ for the profane. This is the\r\nchief concern of the Brâhmans, who were the first to set the example to\r\nother nations who thus anthropomorphized and carnalized the grandest\r\nmetaphysical truths. Nârada shows this plainly and is made to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The _smoke_ of that (fire) which is of excellent glory (appears)\r\n    in the shape of ... darkness [verily so!]; (its) ashes, ... [are]\r\n    passion; and ... goodness is that in connection with it, in which\r\n    the offering is thrown.(1343)\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is to say, that faculty in the disciple which apprehends the subtle\r\ntruth (the flame) which escapes heavenward, while the objective sacrifice\r\nremains as a proof and _evidence of piety_ only to the profane. For what\r\nelse can Nârada mean by the following?\r\n\r\n\r\n    Those who understand the sacrifice understand the Samâna and the\r\n    Vyâna as the _principal_ (offering). The Prâna and Apâna are\r\n    portions of the offering, ... and between them is the _fire_. That\r\n    is the excellent seat of the Udâna as understood by Brâhmanas. As\r\n    to that which is distinct from these pairs, hear me speak about\r\n    that. Day and night are a pair, between them is the fire.... That\r\n    _which exists_ and _that which does not exist_ are a pair, between\r\n    them is the fire....(1344)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd after every such contrast Nârada adds:\r\n\r\n\r\n    That is the excellent seat of the Udâna as understood by\r\n    Brâhmanas.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow many people do not know the full meaning of the statement that Samâna\r\nand Vyâna, Prâna and Apâna—which are explained to be “life‐winds,” but\r\nwhich we say are principles and their respective faculties and senses—are\r\noffered up to Udâna, the _soi‐disant_ principal “life‐wind,” which is said\r\nto act at all the joints. And so the reader who is ignorant that the word\r\n“Fire” in these allegories means both the “Self” and the higher Divine\r\nKnowledge, will understand nothing in this, and will entirely miss the\r\npoint of our argument, as the translator and even the editor, the great\r\nOxford Sanskritist, F. Max Müller, have missed the true meaning of\r\nNârada’s words. Exoterically, this enumeration of “life‐winds” has, of\r\ncourse, the meaning, _approximately_, which is surmised in the foot‐notes,\r\nnamely:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The sense _appears_ to be this: The course of worldly life is due\r\n    to the operations of the life‐winds which are attached to the self\r\n    and lead to its manifestations as individual souls [?]. Of these,\r\n    the Samâna and Vyâna are controlled and held under check by the\r\n    Prâna and Apâna.... The latter two are held in check and\r\n    controlled by the Udâna, which thus controls all. And the control\r\n    of this, which is the control of all five, ... leads to the\r\n    supreme self.(1345)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above is given as an explanation of the text, which records the words\r\nof the Brâhmana, who narrates how he reached the ultimate Wisdom of\r\nYogism, and in this wise reached All‐knowledge. Saying that he had\r\n“perceived by means of the self the seat abiding in the self,”(1346) where\r\ndwells the Brahma free from all; and explaining that that indestructible\r\nprinciple was entirely _beyond the perception of senses_—_i.e._, of the\r\nfive “life‐winds”—he adds that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the midst of all these (life‐winds) which move about in the\r\n    body and swallow up one another, blazes the Vaishvânara fire\r\n    _sevenfold_.(1347)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis “Fire,” according to Nîlakantha’s commentary, is identical with the\r\n“I,” the Self, which is the goal of the ascetic; Vaishvânara being a word\r\noften used for the Self. Then the Brâhmana goes on to enumerate that which\r\nis meant by the word “sevenfold,” and says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The nose [or smell], and the tongue [taste], and the eye, and the\r\n    skin, and the ear as the fifth, the mind, and the understanding,\r\n    these are the seven tongues of the blaze of Vaishvânara.(1348)...\r\n    Those are the seven (kinds of) fuel for me.(1349)... These are the\r\n    _seven great officiating priests_.(1350)\r\n\r\n\r\nThese seven priests are accepted by Arjuna Mishra in the sense of meaning\r\n“the soul distinguished as so many [souls, or principles] with reference\r\nto these several powers”; and, finally, the translator seems to accept the\r\nexplanation, and reluctantly admits that “they may mean” this; though he\r\nhimself takes the sense to mean:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The powers of hearing etc. [the physical senses, in short], which\r\n    are presided over by the several deities.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut whatever it may mean, whether in scientific or orthodox\r\ninterpretations, this passage on page 259 explains Nârada’s statements on\r\npage 276, and shows them referring to exoteric and esoteric methods and\r\ncontrasting them. Thus the Samâna and the Vyâna, though subject to the\r\nPrâna and the Apâna, and all the four to Udâna in the matter of acquiring\r\nthe Prânâyâma (of the Hatha Yogî, chiefly, or the lower form of Yoga), are\r\nyet referred to as the principal offering, for, as rightly argued by K.\r\nTrimbak Telang, their “operations are more practically important for\r\nvitality”; _i.e._, they are the grossest, and are offered in the\r\nsacrifice, in order that they may disappear, so to speak, in the quality\r\nof darkness of that fire or its _smoke_—mere exoteric ritualistic form.\r\nBut Prâna and Apâna, though shown as subordinate (because less gross or\r\nmore purified), have the Fire between them; the Self and the Secret\r\nKnowledge possessed by that Self. So for the good and evil, and for “that\r\nwhich exists and that which does not exist”; all these “pairs”(1351) have\r\nFire between them, _i.e._, Esoteric Knowledge, the Wisdom of the Divine\r\nSelf. Let those who are satisfied with the _smoke_ of the Fire remain\r\nwherein they are, that is to say within the Egyptian darkness of\r\ntheological fictions and dead‐letter interpretations.\r\n\r\nThe above is written only for the Western students of Occultism and\r\nTheosophy. The writer presumes to explain these things neither to the\r\nHindûs, who have their own Gurus; nor to the Orientalists, who think they\r\nknow more than all the Gurus and Rishis, past and present, put together.\r\nThese rather lengthy quotations and examples are necessary, if only to\r\npoint out to the student the works he has to study so as to derive benefit\r\nand learning from comparison. Let him read _Pistis Sophia_ in the light of\r\nthe _Bhagavad Gîtâ_, the _Anugîtâ_ and others; and then the statement made\r\nby Jesus in the Gnostic Gospel will become clear, and the dead‐letter\r\n“blinds” disappear at once. Read the following and compare it with the\r\nexplanation from the Hindû scriptures just given.\r\n\r\n\r\n    And no Name is more excellent than all these, a Name wherein be\r\n    contained all Names, and all Lights, and all the [forty‐nine]\r\n    Powers. Knowing that Name, if a man quits this body of\r\n    matter,(1352) no _smoke_ [_i.e._, no theological delusion],(1353)\r\n    no darkness, nor Power, nor Ruler of the Sphere [no _Personal_\r\n    Genius or Planetary Spirit called God] of Fate [Karma] ... shall\r\n    be able to hold back the Soul that knoweth that Name.... If he\r\n    shall utter that Name unto the fire, ... the darkness shall flee\r\n    away.... And if he shall utter that name unto ... all their\r\n    Powers, nay, even unto Barbelo,(1354) and the Invisible God, and\r\n    the three triple‐powered Gods, so soon as he shall have uttered\r\n    that name in those places, they shall all be thrown one upon the\r\n    other, so that they shall be ready to melt and perish, and shall\r\n    cry aloud, O Light of every light that is in the boundless lights,\r\n    remember us also and purify us!(1355)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see what this Light and Name are: the Light of Initiation\r\nand the name of the “Fire‐Self,” which is no name, no action, but a\r\nSpiritual, Ever‐living Power, higher even than the real “Invisible God,”\r\nas this Power is Itself.\r\n\r\nBut if the able and learned author of the _Gnostics and their Remains_ has\r\nnot sufficiently allowed for the spirit of allegory and mysticism in the\r\nfragments translated and quoted by him, in the above named work, from\r\n_Pistis Sophia_—other Orientalists have done far worse. Having neither his\r\nintuitional perception of the Indian origin of the Gnostic Wisdom still\r\nless of the meaning of their “gems,” most of them, beginning with Wilson\r\nand ending with the dogmatic Weber, have made most extraordinary blunders\r\nwith regard to almost every symbol. Sir M. Monier Williams and others show\r\na very decided contempt for the “Esoteric Buddhists” as Theosophists are\r\nnow called; yet no student of Occult Philosophy has ever mistaken a cycle\r\nfor a living personage and _vice versâ_, as is very often the case with\r\nour learned Orientalists. An instance or two may illustrate the statement\r\nmore graphically. Let us choose the best known.\r\n\r\nIn the _Râmâyana_, Garuda is called “the maternal uncle of Sagara’s 60,000\r\nsons”; and Amshumat, Sagara’s grandson, “the nephew of the 60,000 uncles”\r\nwho were reduced to ashes by the look of Kapila—the Purushottama, or\r\nInfinite Spirit, who caused the horse which Sagara was keeping for the\r\nAshvamedha sacrifice to disappear. Again, Garuda’s son(1356);—Garuda being\r\nhimself the Mahâ Kalpa or Great Cycle—Jatâyu, the king of the feathered\r\ntribe (when on the point of being slain by Râvana who carries off Sîtâ)\r\nsays, speaking of himself: “It is 60,000 years O king, that I am born”;\r\nafter which, _turning his back_ on the Sun—he dies.\r\n\r\nJatâyu is, of course, the cycle of 60,000 years within the Great Cycle of\r\nGaruda; hence he is represented as his son, or nephew, _ad libitum_, since\r\nthe whole meaning rests on his being placed in the line of Garuda’s\r\ndescendants. Then, again, there is Diti, the mother of the Maruts, whose\r\ndescendants and progeny belonged to the posterity of Hiranyâksha, “whose\r\nnumber was 77 crores (or 770 millions) of men,” according to the _Padma\r\nPurâna_. All such narratives are pronounced “meaningless fictions” and\r\nabsurdities. But—truth is the daughter of time, verily; and time _will_\r\nshow.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, what could be easier than an attempt, at least, to verify\r\nPaurânic chronology? There are many Kapilas; but the Kapila who slew king\r\nSagara’s progeny—60,000 men strong—was undeniably Kapila, the founder of\r\nthe Sânkhya philosophy, since it is so stated in the _Purânas_; although\r\none of them flatly denies the imputation without explaining its Esoteric\r\nmeaning. It is the _Bhâgavata Purâna_(1357) which says that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The report is not true that the sons of the king were scorched by\r\n    the wrath of the sage. For how can the quality of darkness, the\r\n    product of anger, exist in a Sage whose body was goodness and who\r\n    purified the world—the earth’s dust, as it were, attributed to\r\n    heavens! How should mental perturbation distract that sage,\r\n    identified with the Supreme Spirit, who has steered here (on\r\n    earth) that solid vessel of the Sânkhya (philosophy), with the\r\n    help of which he who desires to obtain liberation crosses the\r\n    dreaded ocean of existence, that path to death?(1358)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Purâna_ is in duty bound to speak as it does. It has a dogma to\r\npromulgate and a policy to carry out—that of great secrecy with regard to\r\nmystical _divine_ truths divulged for countless ages only at Initiation.\r\nIt is not in the _Purânas_, therefore, that we have to look for an\r\nexplanation of the mystery connected with various transcendental states of\r\nbeing. That the story is an allegory is seen upon its very face: the\r\n60,000 “sons,” brutal, vicious, and impious, are the personification of\r\nthe _human passions_ that a “mere glance of the Sage”—the Self who\r\nrepresents the highest state of purity that can be reached on\r\nEarth—reduces to ashes. But it has also other significations, cyclic and\r\nchronological meanings, a method of marking the periods when certain Sages\r\nflourished, found also in other _Purânas_.\r\n\r\nNow it is as well ascertained as any tradition can be, that it was at\r\nHardwar, or Gangâdvâra, the “door or gate of the Ganges,” at the foot of\r\nthe Himâlayas, that Kapila sat in meditation for a number of years. Not\r\nfar from the Sewalik range, the pass of Hardwar is called to this day\r\n“Kapila’s Pass,” and the place also is named “Kapilasthen” by the\r\nascetics. It is there that the Ganges, Gangâ, emerging from its\r\nmountainous gorge, begins its course over the sultry plains of India. And\r\nit is clearly ascertained by geological survey that the tradition which\r\nclaims that the ocean washed the base of the Himâlayas ages ago, is not\r\nentirely without foundation, for distinct traces of this still remain.\r\n\r\nThe Sânkhya Philosophy may have been _brought down_ and taught by the\r\nfirst, and written out by the _last_ Kapila.\r\n\r\nNow Sâgara is the name of the ocean, and especially of the Bay of Bengal,\r\nat the mouth of the Ganges, to this day in India.(1359) Have Geologists\r\never calculated the number of millenniums it must have taken the sea to\r\nrecede the distance it is now from Hardwar, which is at present 1,024 feet\r\nabove its level? If they had, those Orientalists who show Kapila\r\nflourishing from the first to the ninth century A.D., might change their\r\nopinions, if only for one of two very good reasons. Firstly, the true\r\nnumber of years which have elapsed since Kapila’s day is unmistakably in\r\nthe _Purânas_, though the translators may fail to see it; and secondly,\r\nthe Kapila of the Satya, and the Kapila of the Kali Yugas, may be one and\r\nthe same _individuality_, without being the same _personality_.\r\n\r\nKapila, besides being the name of a personage, of the once living Sage and\r\nthe author of the Sânkhya Philosophy, is also the generic name of the\r\nKumâras, the celestial Ascetics and Virgins; therefore the very fact of\r\nthe _Bhâgavata Purâna_ calling _that_ Kapila—whom it had showed just\r\nbefore as a portion of Vishnu—the author of the Sânkhya Philosophy, ought\r\nto have warned the reader of a “blind” containing an Esoteric meaning.\r\nWhether he was the son of Vitatha, as the _Harivamsha_ shows him to be, or\r\nof any one else, the author of the Sânkhya cannot be the same as the Sage\r\nof the Satya Yuga—at the very beginning of the Manvantara, when Vishnu is\r\nshown _in the form of Kapila_, “imparting to all creatures true Wisdom”;\r\nfor this relates to that primordial period when the “Sons of God” taught\r\nto the newly created men those arts and sciences, which have since been\r\ncultivated and preserved in the sanctuaries by the Initiates. There are\r\nseveral well‐known Kapilas in the _Purânas_. First the primeval Sage, then\r\nKapila one of the three “secret” Kumâras, and Kapila son of Kashyapa and\r\nKadrû—the “many‐headed serpent”(1360)—besides Kapila the great Sage and\r\nPhilosopher of the Kali Yuga. The latter, being an Initiate, a “Serpent of\r\nWisdom,” a Nâga, was purposely blended with the Kapilas of the former\r\nages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection X. The Cross and the Pythagorean Decad.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe early Gnostics claimed that their Science, the Gnosis, rested on a\r\nsquare, the angles of which represented respectively Sigê (Silence),\r\nBythos (Depth), Nous (Spiritual Soul or Mind), and Aletheia (Truth).\r\n\r\nIt is they who were the first to reveal to the world that which had\r\nremained concealed for ages; namely, the Tau, in the shape of a\r\nProcrustean bed, and Christos as incarnating in Chrestos, he who became\r\nfor certain purposes a willing candidate for a series of tortures, mental\r\nand physical.\r\n\r\nFor them the whole of the Universe, metaphysical and material, was\r\ncontained within, and could be expressed and described by the digits\r\ncontained in the number 10, the Pythagorean Decad.\r\n\r\nThis Decad, representing the Universe and its evolution out of Silence and\r\nthe Unknown Depths of the Spiritual Soul, or Anima Mundi, presented two\r\nsides or aspects to the student. It could be, and was at first, applied to\r\nthe Macrocosm, after which it descended to the Microcosm, or man. There\r\nwas, then, the purely intellectual and metaphysical, or the “Inner\r\nScience,” and the as purely materialistic or “surface science,” both of\r\nwhich could be expounded by and contained in the Decad. It could be\r\nstudied, in short, both by the deductive method of Plato, and the\r\ninductive method of Aristotle. The former started from a divine\r\ncomprehension, when the plurality proceeded from unity, or the digits of\r\nthe Decad appeared, only to be finally reäbsorbed, lost in the infinite\r\nCircle. The latter depended on sensuous perception alone, when the Decad\r\ncould be regarded either as the unity that multiplies, or matter which\r\ndifferentiates; its study being limited to the plane surface, to the\r\ncross, or the _seven_ which proceeds from the _ten_, or the perfect\r\nnumber, on Earth as in Heaven.\r\n\r\nThis dual system was brought, together with the Decad, by Pythagoras from\r\nIndia. That it was that of the Brachmans and Iranians, as they are called\r\nby the ancient Greek Philosophers, is warranted to us by the whole range\r\nof Sanskrit literature, such as the _Purânas_ and the _Laws of Manu_. In\r\nthese Laws or Ordinances of Manu, it is said that Brahmâ first creates the\r\n“_ten_ Lords of Being,” the ten Prajâpati or Creative Forces; which ten\r\nproduce _seven_ other Manus, or, rather, as some MSS. have it, Munîn\r\n(instead of Manûn) “devotees,” or holy beings, which are the seven Angels\r\nof the Presence in the Western religion. This mysterious number seven,\r\nborn from the upper Triangle △, the latter itself born from the apex\r\nthereof, or the Silent Depths of the Unknown Universal Soul (Sigê and\r\nBythos), is the sevenfold Saptaparna plant, born and manifested on the\r\nsurface of the soil of mystery, from the threefold root buried deep under\r\nthat impenetrable soil. This idea is fully elaborated in one of the\r\nSections of Volume I, Part II, Section III, “Primordial Substance and\r\nDivine Thought,” which the reader should notice carefully, if he would\r\ngrasp the metaphysical idea involved in the above symbol. In man as in\r\nnature, according to the Cis‐Himâlayan Esoteric Philosophy, which is that\r\nof the Cosmogony of the _original_ Manu, it is the septenary division that\r\nis intended by Nature herself. The seventh principle (Purusha) alone is\r\nthe Divine Self, strictly speaking; for, as said in Manu, “he [Brahmâ]\r\nhaving pervaded the subtile parts of those six, of unmeasured\r\nbrightness,”(1361) created or called them forth to “Self”‐consciousness or\r\nthe consciousness of that One Self. Of these six, five elements (or\r\nprinciples, or Tattvas, as Medhâtithi, the commentator thinks) “are called\r\nthe atomic destructible elements”;(1362) these are described in the above‐\r\nnamed Section.(1363)\r\n\r\nWe have now to speak of the mystery language, that of the prehistoric\r\nraces. It is not a phonetic, but a purely pictorial and symbolical tongue.\r\nIt is known at present in its fulness to the very few, having become with\r\nthe masses for more than 5,000 years an absolutely dead language. Yet most\r\nof the learned Gnostics, Greeks and Jews, knew it, and used it, though\r\nvery differently. A few instances may be given.\r\n\r\nOn the plane above, the number is no number but a _nought_—a _circle_. On\r\nthe plane below, it becomes _one_—which is an odd number. Each letter of\r\nthe ancient alphabets had its philosophical meaning and _raison d’être_.\r\nThe number _one_ (1) signified with the Alexandrian Initiates a _body\r\nerect_, a living standing man, he being the only animal that has this\r\nprivilege. And, by adding to the “I” a head, it was transformed into a\r\n“P,” a symbol of _paternity_, of the creative potency; while “R” signified\r\na “moving man,” one on his way. Hence Pater Zeus had nothing sexual or\r\nphallic either in its sound or the form of its letters; nor had Πατὴρ Δεὺς\r\n(according to Ragon).(1364) If we turn now to the Hebrew alphabet, we\r\nshall find that while _one_ or Aleph (א) has a bull or an ox for its\r\nsymbol, _ten_, the perfect number, or _one_ of the _Kabalah_, is a Yod (י,\r\n_y_, _i_, or _j_), and means, as the first letter of Jehovah, the\r\nprocreative organ, and the rest.\r\n\r\nThe _odd_ numbers are divine, the _even_ numbers are terrestrial,\r\ndevilish, and unlucky. The Pythagoreans hated the Binary. With them it was\r\nthe origin of differentiation, hence of contrasts, discord, or matter, the\r\nbeginning of evil. In the Valentinian Theogony, Bythos and Sigê (Depth,\r\nChaos, Matter born in Silence) are the primordial Binary. With the early\r\nPythagoreans, however, the Duad was that imperfect state into which the\r\nfirst manifested being fell when it got detached from the Monad. It was\r\nthe point from which the two roads—the good and the evil—bifurcated. All\r\nthat which was double‐faced or false was called by them “binary.” One was\r\nalone good and harmony, because no disharmony can proceed from One alone.\r\nHence the Latin word Solus in relation to the One and Only God, the\r\nUnknown of Paul. Solus, however, very soon became Sol—the Sun.\r\n\r\nThe Ternary is the first of the odd numbers, as the triangle is the first\r\nof the geometrical figures.(1365) This number is truly the number of\r\nmystery _par excellence_. To study it on the exoteric lines one has to\r\nread Ragon’s _Cours Philosophique et Interprétatif des Initiations_, on\r\nthe Esoteric—the Hindû symbolism of numerals; for the combinations which\r\nwere applied to it are numberless. It is on the Occult properties of the\r\nthree equal sides of the triangle that Ragon based his studies and founded\r\nthe famous Masonic Society of the Trinosophists—those who study _three_\r\nsciences; an improvement upon the ordinary three Masonic degrees, given to\r\nthose who study nothing except eating and drinking at the meetings of\r\ntheir Lodges. As the founder writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The first line of the triangle offered to the apprentice for study\r\n    is the _mineral kingdom_, symbolized by Tubalc [Symbol: Three dots\r\n    in a triangle] [Tubal‐Cain].\r\n\r\n    The second side on which the companion has to meditate, is the\r\n    _vegetable kingdom_, symbolized by Schibb [Symbol: Three dots in a\r\n    triangle] [Schibboleth]. In this kingdom begins the _generation of\r\n    the bodies_. This is why the letter G is presented radiant before\r\n    the eyes of the adept [?!].\r\n\r\n    The third side is left to the master mason, who has to complete\r\n    his education by the study of the _animal kingdom_. It is\r\n    symbolized by Maoben [Symbol: Three dots in a triangle] (son of\r\n    putrefaction).(1366)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first solid figure is the Quaternary, the symbol of immortality. It is\r\nthe Pyramid, for the Pyramid stands on a triangular base, and terminates\r\nwith a point at the top, thus yielding the Triad and the Quaternary or the\r\n3 and 4.\r\n\r\nThe Pythagoreans taught the connection and relation between the Gods and\r\nthe numbers, in a science called Arithmomancy. The Soul is a number, they\r\nsaid, which moves of itself and contains the number 4; and spiritual and\r\nphysical man is number 3, as the Ternary represented for them not only the\r\nsurface but also the principle of the formation of the physical body. Thus\r\nanimals were Ternaries only, man alone being a Septenary, _when virtuous_;\r\na Quinary when bad, for:\r\n\r\nNumber Five was composed of a Binary and a Ternary, and of these the\r\nBinary threw everything in the perfect form into disorder and confusion.\r\nThe _perfect man_, they said, was a Quaternary and a Ternary, or _four_\r\nmaterial and _three_ immaterial elements; and these three Spirits or\r\nElements we likewise find in Five when it represents the microcosm. The\r\nlatter is a compound of a Binary directly relating to gross Matter and of\r\nthree Spirits. Since, as Ragon says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    This ingenious figure is the union of two Greek breathings placed\r\n    over vowels which have or have not to be aspirated. The first sign\r\n    (῾) is called the “strong” or superior “spiritus,” the Spirit of\r\n    God aspired (_spiratus_) and breathed by man. The second sign (᾿)\r\n    the lower, is the soft “spiritus” representing the secondary\r\n    spirit; ... the whole embraces the whole man. It is the _universal\r\n    quintessence_, the vital fluid or life.(1367)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe more mystic meaning of the number Five is given in an excellent\r\narticle by Mr. T. Subba Row, in _Five Years of Theosophy_, in an article\r\nentitled “The Twelve Signs of the Zodiac,” in which he gives some rules\r\nthat may help the enquirer to ferret out “the deep significance of ancient\r\nSanskrit nomenclature in the old Âryan myths and allegories.” Meanwhile,\r\nlet us see what has been hitherto stated about the constellation\r\nCapricornus in Theosophical publications, and what is known of it\r\ngenerally. Every one knows that ♑ is the tenth sign of the Zodiac, into\r\nwhich the Sun enters at the winter solstice, about December 21st. But very\r\nfew are those who know—even in India, unless they are initiated—the real\r\nmystic connection which seems to exist, as we are told, between the names\r\nMakara and Kumâra. The first means some amphibious animal, flippantly\r\ncalled the “crocodile,” as some Orientalists think, and the second is the\r\ntitle of the great patrons of Yogins, according to the Shaiva _Purânas_,\r\nthe sons of, and even one with, Rudra (Shiva), who is a Kumâra himself. It\r\nis through their connection with Man that the Kumâras are likewise\r\nconnected with the Zodiac. Let us try to find out what the word Makara\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nSays the author of “The Twelve Signs of the Zodiac”:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Makara ... contains within itself the clue to its correct\r\n    interpretation. The letter _ma_ is equivalent to number 5, and\r\n    _kara_ means hand. Now in Sanskrit Tribhujam means a triangle,\r\n    _bhujam_ or _karam_ (both synonymous) being understood to mean a\r\n    side. So, Makaram or Panchakaram means a Pentagon.(1368)\r\n\r\n\r\nNow the five‐pointed star or pentagon represents the five limbs of\r\nman.(1369) Under the old system, we are told, Makara was the _eighth_\r\ninstead of the tenth sign.(1370)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The sign in question is intended to represent the faces of the\r\n    universe, and indicates that the figure of the universe is bounded\r\n    by Pentagons.(1371)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sanskrit writers “speak also of Ashtadisha or eight faces bounding\r\nSpace,” referring thus to the Loka‐pâlas, the eight points of the compass,\r\nthe four cardinal and the four intermediate points.\r\n\r\n\r\n    From an objective point of view the “microcosm” is represented by\r\n    the human body. Makaram may be taken to represent simultaneously\r\n    both the microcosm and the macrocosm, as external objects of\r\n    perception.(1372)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the true Esoteric sense of the word Makara is not, in truth,\r\n“crocodile” at all, even when it is compared with the animal depicted on\r\nthe Hindû Zodiac. For it has the head and the fore‐legs of an antelope and\r\nthe body and tail of a fish. Hence the tenth sign of the Zodiac has been\r\ntaken variously to mean a shark, a dolphin, etc.; as it is the Vâhana of\r\nVaruna, the Ocean God, and is often called, for this reason, Jala‐rûpa or\r\n“water‐form.” The dolphin was the vehicle of Poseidon‐Neptune with the\r\nGreeks, and one with him, Esoterically; and this “dolphin” is the “sea‐\r\ndragon” as much as the crocodile of the Sacred Nile is the Vehicle of\r\nHorus, and Horus himself. Says the mummy‐form God with the crocodile’s\r\nhead:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I am the fish [and seat] of the great Horus of Kem‐oor.(1373)\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the Peratæ Gnostics it is Chozzar (Neptune) who converts the\r\ndodecagonal pyramid into a sphere, “and paints its gate with many\r\ncolours.”(1374) He has _five androgyne_ ministers—he is Makara, the\r\nLeviathan.\r\n\r\nAs the rising Sun was considered the Soul of the Gods sent to manifest\r\nitself to men every day, and as the crocodile rose out of the water at the\r\nfirst sunbeam, that animal came finally to personify a solar‐fire devotee\r\nin India, as it personified that Fire, or the highest Soul with the\r\nEgyptians.\r\n\r\nIn the _Purânas_, the number of the Kumâras changes according to the\r\nexigencies of the allegory. For Occult purposes their number is given in\r\none place as seven, then as four, then as five. In the _Kûrma Purâna_ it\r\nis said of them:\r\n\r\n\r\n    These _five_ [Kumâras], O Brâhman, were Yogins who acquired entire\r\n    exemption from passion.\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir very name shows their connection with the said constellation Makara,\r\nand with some other Paurânic characters connected with the zodiacal signs.\r\nThis is done in order to veil what was one of the most suggestive glyphs\r\nof the primitive Temples. The Kumâras are mixed up, astronomically,\r\nphysiologically, and mystically in general, with a number of Paurânic\r\npersonages and events. Hardly hinted at in the _Vishnu_, they figure in\r\nvarious dramas and events throughout all the other _Purânas_ and sacred\r\nliterature; so that the Orientalists, having to pick up the threads of\r\nconnection hither and thither, have ended by proclaiming the Kumâras “due\r\nchiefly to the fancy of the Purânic writers.” But—\r\n\r\n_Ma_—we are told by the author of the “Twelve Signs of the Zodiac”—is\r\n“five”; _kara_, a “hand” with its five fingers, as also a five‐sided sign\r\nor a Pentagon. The Kumâra (in this case an anagram for Occult purposes),\r\nas Yogîs, are _five_ in Esotericism, because the last two names have ever\r\nbeen kept secret; they are the fifth order of Brahma‐devas, and the five‐\r\nfold Chohans, having the Soul of the five Elements in them, Water and\r\nEther predominating, and therefore their symbols were both _aquatic_ and\r\n_fiery_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Wisdom lies concealed under the couch of him who rests on the\r\n    Golden Lotus (Padma) floating on the Water.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn India this is Vishnu, one of whose Avatâras was Buddha, as claimed in\r\ndays of old. The Prachetasas, the worshippers of Nârâyana—who, like\r\nPoseidon, moved or dwelt _over_ not under the Waters—plunged into the\r\ndepths of the Ocean for their devotions and remained therein 10,000 years;\r\nand the Prachetasas are _ten_ exoterically, but _five_, Esoterically.\r\nPrachetâs is, in Sanskrit, the name of Varuna, the Water God, Nereus, an\r\naspect of Neptune, the Prachetasas being thus identical with the “five\r\nministers” of the male‐female Chozzar (Χωζζάρ or Χορζάρ), or Poseidon, of\r\nthe Peratæ Gnostics. These are respectively called Ou, Aoai, Ouô, Ouôab\r\nand ... (Οὔ, Ἀοαὶ, Οὐώ, Οὐωάβ ...),(1375) the _fifth_, a _triple_ name\r\n(making seven in all) being lost(1376)—_i.e._, kept secret. Thus much for\r\nthe “aquatic” symbol; the “fiery” connecting them with the fiery\r\nsymbol—spiritually. For purposes of identity, let us remember that as the\r\nmother of the Prachetasas was Savarnâ, the daughter of the Ocean, so was\r\nAmphitrite the mother of Neptune’s mystic “ministers.”\r\n\r\nNow the reader is reminded that these “five ministers” are symbolized both\r\nin the Dolphin, who had overcome the chaste Amphitrite’s unwillingness to\r\nwed Poseidon, and in Triton their son. The latter, whose body above the\r\nwaist is that of a man and below a dolphin, a fish, is, again, most\r\nmysteriously connected with Oannes, the Babylonian Dag, and further also\r\nwith the Matsya (Fish) Avatâra of Vishnu, both teaching mortals Wisdom.\r\nThe Dolphin, as every Mythologist knows, was placed, for his service, by\r\nPoseidon, among the constellations, and became with the Greeks,\r\nCapricornus, the Goat, whose hind part is that of a dolphin, and is thus\r\nidentical with Makara, whose head is also that of an antelope and the body\r\nand tail those of a fish. This is why the sign of the Makara was borne on\r\nthe banner of Kâmadeva, the Hindû God of Love, identified, in the _Atharva\r\nVeda_, with Agni, the Fire‐god, the son of Lakshmî, as correctly given by\r\nthe _Harivamsha_. For Lakshmî and Venus are one, and Amphitrite is the\r\nearly form of Venus. Now Kâma, the Makara‐ketu, is Aja, the “unborn,” and\r\nÂtmâ‐bhû, the “self‐existent,” and Aja is the Logos in the _Rig Veda_, as\r\nhe is shown therein to be the first manifestation of the One; for “Desire\r\nfirst arose in It, which was the primal germ of mind,” that “which\r\nconnects entity with non‐entity”—or Manas, the _fifth_, with Âtmâ, the\r\n_seventh_, Esoterically—say the Sages. This is the _first_ stage. The\r\nsecond, on the following plane of manifestation, shows Brahmâ—whom we\r\nselect as a representative for all the other First Gods of the\r\nnations—causing to issue from his body his Mind‐born Sons, “Sanandana and\r\nothers,” who, in the _fifth_ “creation,” and again in the ninth (for\r\npurposes of a “blind”) become the Kumâra. Let us close by reminding the\r\nreader that goats were sacrificed to Amphitrite and the Nereids on the\r\nsea‐shore—as goats are sacrificed to this day to Durgâ Kâlî, who is only\r\nthe _black_ side of Lakshmî (Venus), the _white_ side of Shakti—and by\r\nsuggesting what connection these animals may have with Capricornus, in\r\nwhich appear twenty‐eight stars in the form of a goat, which goat was\r\ntransformed by the Greeks into Amalthæa, Jupiter’s foster‐mother. Pan, the\r\nGod of Nature, had goat’s feet, and changed himself into a goat at the\r\napproach of Typhon. But this is a mystery which the writer dares not dwell\r\nupon at length, not being sure of being understood. Thus the mystical side\r\nof the interpretation must be left to the intuition of the student. Let us\r\nnote one more thing in relation to the mysterious number Five. It\r\nsymbolizes at one and the same time the Spirit of Life Eternal and the\r\nspirit of life and love terrestrial—in the human compound; and, it\r\nincludes divine and infernal magic, and the universal and the individual\r\nquintessence of being. Thus, the five mystic words or vowels uttered by\r\nBrahmâ at “creation,” which forthwith became the Panchadasha (certain\r\nVedic Hymns, attributed to that God), are in their creative and magical\r\npotentiality, the _white_ side of the _black_ Tântric _five_ Ma‐kâras, or\r\nthe five _m’s_. Makara, the constellation, is a seemingly meaningless and\r\nabsurd name; yet, even besides its anagrammatical significance in\r\nconjunction with the term Kumâra, the numerical value of its first\r\nsyllable and its Esoteric resolution into _five_ has a very great and\r\nOccult meaning in the mysteries of Nature.\r\n\r\nSuffice it to say that, as the sign of Makara is connected with the birth\r\nof the spiritual Microcosm, and the death or dissolution of the physical\r\nUniverse—its passage into the realm of the Spiritual,(1377) so the Dhyân\r\nChohans, called in India Kumâras, are connected with both. Moreover, in\r\nthe exoteric religions, they have become the synonyms of the Angels of\r\nDarkness. Mâra is the God of Darkness, the Fallen One, and Death;(1378)\r\nand yet it is one of the names of Kâma, the First God in the Vedas, the\r\nLogos, from whom have sprung the Kumâras, and this connects them still\r\nmore with our “fabulous” Indian Makara, and the crocodile‐headed God in\r\nEgypt.(1379) The Crocodiles in the Celestial Nile are _five_, and the God\r\nToom, the Primordial Deity, creating the heavenly bodies and living\r\nbeings, calls forth these Crocodiles in his _fifth_ “creation.” When\r\nOsiris, the “Defunct Sun,” is buried and enters into Amenti, the sacred\r\nCrocodiles plunge into the abyss of primordial Waters—the “Great Green\r\nOne.” When the Sun of Life rises, they reëmerge out of the sacred river.\r\nAll this is highly symbolical, and shows how primeval Esoteric truths\r\nfound their expression in identical symbols. But, as Mr. T. Subba Row\r\ntruly declares:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The veil that was dexterously thrown over certain portions of the\r\n    mystery connected with these [Zodiacal] signs by the ancient\r\n    philosophers, _will never be lifted up for the amusement or\r\n    edification of the uninitiated public_.(1380)\r\n\r\n\r\nNor was number Five less sacred with the Greeks. The “Five Words” of\r\nBrahmâ have become with the Gnostics the “Five Words” written upon the\r\nÂkâshic (Shining) Garment of Jesus at his glorification—the words “Zama\r\nZama Ôzza Rachama Ôzai” (ΖΑΜΑ ΖΑΜΑ ΩΖΖΑ ΡΑΧΑΜΑ ΩΖΑΙ), translated by the\r\nOrientalists “the robe, the glorious robe of my strength.” These words\r\nwere, in their turn, the anagrammatic “blind” of the five mystic Powers\r\nrepresented on the robe of the “resurrected” Initiate after his last trial\r\nof three days’ trance; the five becoming _seven_ only after his “death,”\r\nwhen the Adept became the full Christos, the full Krishna‐Vishnu, _i.e._,\r\nmerged in Nirvâna. The E Delphicum, a sacred symbol, was the numeral\r\n_five_, again; and how sacred it was is shown by the fact that the\r\nCorinthians, according to Plutarch, replaced the wooden numeral in the\r\nDelphic Temple by a bronze one, and this one was transmuted by Livia\r\nAugusta into a facsimile in gold.(1381)\r\n\r\nIt is easy to recognize in the two “Spiritus”—the Greek signs (!) spoken\r\nof by Ragon—Âtmâ and Buddhi, or Divine Spirit and its Vehicle, the\r\nSpiritual Soul.\r\n\r\nThe Six or the Senary is dealt with later in this Section, while the\r\nSeptenary will be fully treated in the course of this Volume in the\r\nSection on “The Mysteries of the Hebdomad.”\r\n\r\nThe Ogdoad or Eight symbolizes the eternal and spiral motion of cycles,\r\nthe 8, ∞, and is symbolized in its turn by the Caduceus. It shows the\r\nregular breathing of the Kosmos presided over by the Eight Great Gods—the\r\nSeven from the primeval Mother, the One and the Triad.\r\n\r\nThen comes the number Nine, or the triple Ternary. It is the number which\r\nreproduces itself incessantly under all shapes and figures in every\r\nmultiplication. It is the sign of every circumference, since its value in\r\ndegrees is equal to 9, _i.e._, to 3 + 6 + 0. It is a _bad_ number under\r\ncertain conditions, and very unlucky. If number 6 was the symbol of our\r\nGlobe ready to be animated by a _divine_ Spirit, 9 symbolized our Earth\r\ninformed by a _bad_ or evil Spirit.\r\n\r\nTen, or the Decad, brings all these digits back to unity, and ends the\r\nPythagorean table. Hence this figure, [Symbol: Circle with line through\r\nthe middle]—_unity_ within _zero_—was the symbol of Deity, of the\r\nUniverse, and of Man. Such is the secret meaning of “the strong grip of\r\nthe lion’s paw, of the tribe of Judah” (the “master mason’s grip”) between\r\ntwo hands, the joint number of whose fingers is _ten_.\r\n\r\nIf we now give our attention to the Egyptian cross, or the Tau, we may\r\ndiscover this letter, which was so exalted by Egyptians, Greeks, and Jews,\r\nto be mysteriously connected with the Decad. The Tau is the Alpha and the\r\nOmega of Secret Divine Wisdom, which is symbolized by the initial and the\r\nfinal letters of Thot (Hermes). Thot was the inventor of the Egyptian\r\nalphabet, and the letter Tau closed the alphabets of the Jews and the\r\nSamaritans, who called this character the “end” or “perfection,”\r\n“culmination” and “security.” Hence, Ragon tells us, the words Terminus,\r\n“end,” and Tectum, “roof,” are symbols of shelter and security—which is\r\nrather a prosaic definition. But such is the usual destiny of ideas and\r\nthings in this world of spiritual decadence, though at the same time of\r\nphysical progress. Pan was at one time Absolute Nature, the One and Great\r\nAll; but when history catches a first glimpse of him, Pan has already\r\ntumbled down into a _godling_ of the fields, a rural God; history will not\r\nrecognize him, while theology makes of him the Devil! Yet his seven‐piped\r\nflute, the emblem of the seven forces of Nature, of the seven planets, the\r\nseven musical notes, of all the septenary harmony in short, shows well his\r\nprimordial character. So with the cross. Far earlier than the Jews had\r\ndevised their golden candlestick of the Temple with _three_ sockets on one\r\nside and _four_ on the other, and made of number _seven_ a feminine number\r\nof generation(1382)—thus introducing the phallic element into religion—the\r\nmore spiritually‐minded nations had made of the cross (as 3 + 4 = 7) their\r\nmost sacred divine symbol. In fact, circle, cross, and seven—the latter\r\nbeing made a base of _circular_ measurement—are the first primordial\r\nsymbols. Pythagoras, who brought his wisdom from India, left to posterity\r\na glimpse into this truth. His School regarded number 7 as a compound of\r\nnumbers 3 and 4, which they explained in a dual manner. On the plane of\r\nthe noumenal world, the Triangle was, as the first conception of the\r\nmanifested Deity, its image, “Father‐Mother‐Son”; and the Quaternary, the\r\nperfect number, was the noumenal, ideal root of all numbers and things on\r\nthe physical plane. Some students, in view of the sacredness of the\r\nTetraktys and the Tetragrammaton, mistake the mystic meaning of the\r\nQuaternary. The latter was with the Ancients only a _secondary_\r\n“perfection,” so to speak, because it related only to the manifested\r\nplanes. Whereas it is the Triangle, the Greek Delta (Δ), which was the\r\n“vehicle of the unknown Deity.” A good proof of it lies in the name of the\r\nDeity beginning with Delta. Zeus was written Δεύς (Deus) by the Bœotians,\r\nthence the Deus of the Latins. This, in relation to the metaphysical\r\nconception, with regard to the meaning of the septenary _in the phenomenal\r\nworld_; but for purposes of profane or exoteric interpretation, the\r\nsymbolism changed. _Three_ became the ideograph of the three _material_\r\nElements—Air, Water, Earth; and _four_ became the principle of all that\r\nwhich is neither corporeal nor perceptible. But this has never been\r\naccepted by the real Pythagoreans. Viewed as a compound of 6 and 1, the\r\nSenary and the Unity, number 7 was the invisible centre, the Spirit of\r\neverything, as there exists no hexagonal body without a _seventh_ property\r\nbeing found as the central point in it, as, for instance, crystals and\r\nsnow‐flakes in so‐called “inanimate” nature. Moreover, number _seven_,\r\nthey said, has all the perfection of the _unit_—the number of numbers. For\r\nas absolute _unity_ is uncreated, and impartite, hence number‐less, and no\r\nnumber can produce it, so is the _seven_; no digit contained within the\r\nDecad can beget or produce it. And it is _four_ which affords an\r\narithmetical division between _unity_ and _seven_, for it surpasses the\r\nformer by the same number (_three_), as it is itself surpassed by the\r\n_seven_, since _four_ is by as many numbers above _one_, as _seven_ is\r\nabove _four_.(1383)\r\n\r\n“With the Egyptians number 7 was the symbol of _life_ eternal,” says\r\nRagon, and adds that this is why the Greek letter Z, which is but a double\r\n7, is the initial letter of Zaô, “I live,” and of Zeus, the “father of all\r\nliving.”\r\n\r\nMoreover, figure 6 was the symbol of the Earth during the autumn and\r\nwinter “sleeping” months, and figure 7 during spring and summer, as the\r\nSpirit of Life animated her at that time—the seventh or central informing\r\nForce. We find the same in the Egyptian mythos and symbol of Osiris and\r\nIsis, personifying Fire and Water metaphysically, and the Sun and the Nile\r\nphysically. The number of the solar year, 365 in days, is the numerical\r\nvalue of the word Neilos (Nile). This, together with the Bull, with the\r\ncrescent and the ansated cross between its horns, and the Earth under its\r\nastronomical symbol (♁), are the most phallic symbols of later antiquity.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Nile was the river of time with the number of a year, or year\r\n    and a day (364 + 1 = 365). It represented the parturient water of\r\n    Isis, or Mother Earth, the moon, the woman, and the cow, also the\r\n    _workshop_ of Osiris, representing the T’sod Olaum of the Hebrews.\r\n    The ancient name of this river was Eridanus, or the Hebrew Iardan,\r\n    with the Coptic or old Greek suffix. This was the door of the\r\n    Hebrew word Jared, or _source_, or _descent_ ... of the river\r\n    Jordan, which had the same mythical use with the Hebrews that the\r\n    Nile had with the Egyptians,(1384) it was the source of descent,\r\n    and held the waters of life.(1385)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was, to put it plainly, the symbol of the personified Earth, or Isis\r\nregarded as the womb of that Earth. This is shown clearly enough; and\r\nJordan—the river so sacred now to Christians—held no more sublime or\r\npoetical meaning in it than the parturient waters of the Moon—Isis, or\r\nJehovah in his female aspect. Now, as shown by the same scholar, Osiris\r\nwas the Sun, and the river Nile, and the year of 365 days; while Isis was\r\nthe Moon, the bed of that river, or Mother Earth “for the parturient\r\nenergies of which water was a necessity,” as also the lunar year of 354\r\ndays, “the time‐maker of the periods of gestation.” All this then is\r\nsexual and phallic, our modern scholars seeming to find in these symbols\r\nnothing beyond a physiological or phallic meaning. Nevertheless, the three\r\nfigures 365, or the number of days in a solar year, have but to be read\r\nwith the Pythagorean key to find in them a highly philosophical and moral\r\nmeaning. One instance will be sufficient. It can read:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Earth (3)—animated by (6)—the Spirit of Life (5).\r\n\r\n\r\nSimply because 3 is equivalent to the Greek Gamma (Γ) which is the symbol\r\nof Gaia, the Earth, while the figure 6 is the symbol of the animating or\r\ninforming principle, and the 5 is the universal quintessence which spreads\r\nin every direction and forms all matter.(1386)\r\n\r\nThe few instances and examples brought forward reveal only one small\r\nportion of the methods used to read the symbolical ideographs and numerals\r\nof antiquity. The system being of an extreme and complex difficulty, very\r\nfew, even among the Initiates, could master _all_ the seven keys. Is it to\r\nbe wondered, then, that the metaphysical gradually dwindled down into the\r\nphysical Nature; that the Sun, once upon a time the symbol of Deity,\r\nbecame, as æons glided by, that of its creative ardour only; and that\r\nthence it fell into a glyph of phallic significance? But surely, it is not\r\nthose whose method, like Plato’s, was to proceed from universals down to\r\nparticulars, who could ever have begun by symbolizing their religions by\r\nsexual emblems! It is quite true, though uttered by that incarnated\r\nparadox Éliphas Lévi, that “man is God on Earth, and God is man in\r\nHeaven.” But this could not, and never did apply to the One Deity, only to\r\nthe Hosts of Its incarnated beams, called by us Dhyân Chohans, by the\r\nAncients Gods, and now transformed by the Church into Devils on the\r\n_left_, and into the Saviour on the _right_ side!\r\n\r\nBut all such dogmas grew out of the one root, the root of Wisdom, which\r\ngrows and thrives on the Indian soil. There is not an Archangel that could\r\nnot be traced back to its prototype in the sacred land of Âryâvarta. These\r\nprototypes are all connected with the Kumâras who appear on the scene of\r\naction by “refusing”—as Sanatkumâra and Sananda—to “create progeny.” Yet\r\nthey are called the “creators” of (thinking) man. More than once they are\r\nbrought into connection with Nârada—another bundle of _apparent_\r\nincongruities, yet a wealth of philosophical tenets. Nârada is the leader\r\nof the Gandharvas, the celestial singers and musicians; Esoterically, the\r\nreason for this is explained by the fact that the Gandharvas are “the\r\ninstructors of men in the Secret Sciences.” It is they, who “loving the\r\nwomen of the Earth” disclosed to them the mysteries of creation; or, as in\r\nthe _Veda_, the “heavenly” Gandharva is a deity who knew and revealed the\r\nsecrets of heaven and divine truths, in general. If we remember what is\r\nsaid of this class of Angels in _Enoch_ and in the _Bible_, then the\r\nallegory is plain; their leader, Nârada, while refusing to procreate,\r\nleads men to become Gods. Moreover, all of these, as stated in the\r\n_Vedas_, are Chhandajas, “will‐born,” or incarnated, in different\r\nManvantaras, _of their own will_. They are shown in exoteric literature as\r\nexisting age after age; some being “cursed to be reborn,” others\r\nincarnating as a duty. Finally, as the Sanakadikas, the seven Kumâras who\r\nwent to visit Vishnu on the “White Island” (Shveta‐dvîpa), the Island\r\ninhabited by the Mahâ Yogins—they are connected with Shâka‐dvîpa and the\r\nLemurians and Atlanteans of the Third and Fourth Races.\r\n\r\nIn the Esoteric Philosophy, the Rudras (Kumâras, Âdityas, Gandharvas,\r\nAsuras, etc.) are the highest Dhyân Chohans or Devas as regards\r\nintellectuality. They are those who, owing to their having acquired by\r\nself‐development the _five‐fold_ nature—hence the sacredness of number\r\n_five_—became independent of the pure Arûpa Devas. This is a mystery very\r\ndifficult to realize and understand correctly. For we see that those who\r\nwere “obedient to law” are, equally with the “rebels,” _doomed to be\r\nreborn in every age_. Nârada, the Rishi, is cursed by Brahmâ to incessant\r\nperipateticism on Earth, _i.e._, to be constantly reborn. He is a rebel\r\nagainst Brahmâ, and yet has no worse fate than the Jayas—the twelve great\r\nCreative Gods produced by Brahmâ as his assistants in the functions of\r\ncreation. For the latter, lost in meditation, only _forgot to create_; and\r\nfor this, they were equally cursed by Brahmâ to be born in every\r\nManvantara. And still they are termed—together with the rebels—Chhandajas,\r\nor those born of their own will in human form.\r\n\r\nAll this is very puzzling to one who is unable to read and understand the\r\n_Purânas_ except in their dead‐letter sense.(1387) Hence we find the\r\nOrientalists refusing to be puzzled, and cutting the Gordian knot of\r\nperplexity by declaring the whole scheme “figments ... of Brâhmanical\r\nfancy and love of exaggeration.” But to the student of Occultism, the\r\nwhole is pregnant with deep philosophical meaning. We willingly leave the\r\nrind to the Western Sanskritist, but claim the essence of the fruit for\r\nourselves. We do more: we concede that in one sense much in these so‐\r\ncalled “fables” refers to astronomical allegories about constellations,\r\nasterisms, stars, and planets. Yet, while the Gandharva of the _Rig Veda_\r\nmay there be made to personify the fire of the Sun, the Gandharva Devas\r\nare entities both of a physical and psychic character, while the Apsarasas\r\n(with other Rudras) are both _qualities_ and _quantities_. In short, if\r\never unravelled, the Theogony of the Vedic Gods will reveal fathomless\r\nmysteries of Creation and Being. Truly says Parâshara:\r\n\r\n\r\n    These classes of thirty‐three divinities ... exist age after age,\r\n    and their appearance and disappearance is in the same manner as\r\n    the sun sets and rises again.(1388)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a time, when the Eastern symbol of the cross and circle, the\r\nSvastika, was universally adopted. With the Esoteric, and for the matter\r\nof that exoteric, Buddhist, the Chinaman and the Mongolian, it means the\r\n“ten thousand truths.” These truths, they say, belong to the mysteries of\r\nthe Unseen Universe and Primordial Cosmogony and Theogony.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Since Fohat crossed the Circle like two lines of flame\r\n    [horizontally and vertically], the Hosts of the Blessed Ones have\r\n    never failed to send their representatives upon the Planets they\r\n    are made to watch over from the beginning._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is why the Svastika is always placed—as the ansated cross was in\r\nEgypt—on the breast of the defunct Mystics. It is found on the heart of\r\nthe images and statues of Buddha, in Tibet and Mongolia. It is the _seal_\r\nplaced also on the hearts of the living Initiates, burnt into the flesh\r\nfor ever with some. This, because they have to keep these truths inviolate\r\nand intact, in eternal silence and secrecy to the day they are perceived\r\nand read by their chosen successors—new Initiates—“worthy of being\r\nentrusted with the ten thousand perfections.” So degraded, however, has it\r\nnow become, that it is often placed on the headgear of the “Gods,” the\r\nhideous idols of the sacrilegious Bhons—the Dugpas or Sorcerers, of the\r\nTibetan borderlands—until found out by a Galukpa, and torn off together\r\nwith the head of the “God,” though it would be better were it that of the\r\nworshipper which was severed from his sinful body. Still, it can never\r\nlose its mysterious properties. Throw a retrospective glance, and see it\r\nused alike by the Initiates and Seers, as by the Priests of Troy, for many\r\nspecimens of it have been found by Schliemann on the site of that old\r\ncity. One finds it with the old Peruvians, the Assyrians, Chaldæans, as\r\nwell as on the walls of the old‐world Cyclopean buildings; in the\r\ncatacombs of the _New_ World, and in those of the _Old_ (?), at Rome,\r\nwhere—because the first Christians are supposed to have concealed\r\nthemselves and their religion—it is called Crux Dissimulata.\r\n\r\n\r\n    According to De Rossi the Swastika from an early period was a\r\n    favourite form of the cross _employed with an occult\r\n    signification_ which shows the secret was not that of the\r\n    Christian cross. One Swastika cross in the catacombs is the sign\r\n    of an inscription which reads “ΖΩΤΙΚΩ ΖΟΤΙΚΗ [? ΖΩΤΙΚΗ], _Vitalis\r\n    Vitalia_,” or life of life.(1389)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the best evidence to the antiquity of the cross is that which is\r\nbrought forward by the author of _The Natural Genesis_ himself:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The value of the cross as a Christian symbol is supposed to date\r\n    from the time when Jesus Christ was crucified. And yet in the\r\n    “Christian” _iconography of the catacombs no figure of a man\r\n    appears upon the Cross during the first six or seven centuries_.\r\n    There are all forms of the cross except that—the alleged starting‐\r\n    point of the new religion. That was not the initial but the final\r\n    form of the Crucifix.(1390) During some six centuries after the\r\n    Christian era the foundation of the Christian religion in a\r\n    crucified Redeemer is entirely absent from Christian art! The\r\n    earliest known form of the human figure on the cross is the\r\n    crucifix presented by Pope Gregory the Great to Queen Theodolinde\r\n    of Lombardy, now in the Church of St. John at Monza, whilst no\r\n    image of the Crucified is found in the catacombs at Rome earlier\r\n    than that of San Giulio, belonging to the seventh or eighth\r\n    century.... There is no Christ and no Crucified; the Cross is the\r\n    Christ even as the Stauros (Cross) was a type and a name of Horus\r\n    the Gnostic Christ. The Cross, not the Crucified, is the primary\r\n    symbol of the Christian Church. The Cross, not the Crucified, is\r\n    the essential object of representation in its art, and of\r\n    adoration in its religion. The germ of the whole growth and\r\n    development can be traced to the cross. And that cross is pre‐\r\n    Christian, is pagan and heathen, in half a dozen different shapes.\r\n    The Cult began with the cross, and Julian was right in saying he\r\n    waged a “Warfare with the X”; which he obviously considered had\r\n    been adopted by the A‐Gnostics and Mytholators to convey an\r\n    impossible significance.(1391) During centuries the cross stood\r\n    for the Christ, and was addressed as if it were a living being. It\r\n    was divinized at first and humanized at last.(1392)\r\n\r\n\r\nFew world‐symbols are more pregnant with real Occult meaning than the\r\nSvastika. It is symbolized by the figure 6. Like that figure, it points,\r\nin its concrete imagery, as does the ideograph of the number, to the\r\nZenith and the Nadir, to North, South, West, and East; one finds the unit\r\neverywhere, and that unit reflected in all and every unit. It is the\r\nemblem of the activity of Fohat, of the continual revolution of the\r\n“Wheels,” and of the Four Elements, the “Sacred Four,” in their mystical,\r\nand not alone in their cosmical meaning; further, its four arms, bent at\r\nright angles, are intimately related, as shown elsewhere, to the\r\nPythagorean and Hermetic scales. One initiated into the mysteries of the\r\nmeaning of the Svastika, say the Commentaries, “can trace on it, with\r\nmathematical precision, the evolution of Kosmos and the whole period of\r\nSandhyâ.” Also “the relation of the Seen to the Unseen,” and “the first\r\nprocreation of man and species.”\r\n\r\nTo the Eastern Occultist the Tree of Knowledge, in the Paradise of man’s\r\nown heart, becomes the Tree of Life Eternal, and has nought to do with\r\nman’s animal senses. It is an absolute mystery that reveals itself only\r\nthrough the efforts of the imprisoned Manas, the Ego, to liberate itself\r\nfrom the thraldom of sensuous perception, and see in the light of the one\r\neternal present Reality. To the Western Kabalist, and far more now to the\r\nsuperficial Symbologist, nursed in the lethal atmosphere of Materialistic\r\nScience, the chief explanation of the mysteries of the cross is—its sexual\r\nelement. Even the otherwise spiritualistic modern commentator discerns\r\nthis feature in the cross and Svastika before all others.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The cross was used in Egypt as a protecting talisman and a symbol\r\n    of saving power. Typhon, or Satan, is actually found chained to\r\n    and bound by the cross. In the _Ritual_, the Osirian cries, “_The\r\n    Apophis is overthrown, their cords bind the South, North, East,\r\n    and West, their cords are on him. Har‐ru‐bah has knotted\r\n    him._”(1393) These were the Cords of the four quarters, or the\r\n    cross. Thor is said to smite the head of the serpent with his\r\n    hammer, ... a form of Swastika or four‐footed cross.... In the\r\n    primitive sepulchres of Egypt the model of the Chamber had the\r\n    form of a cross.(1394) The pagoda of Mathura ... the birth‐place\r\n    of Krishna, was built in the form of a cross.(1395)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is perfect, and no one can discern in it that “sexual worship,” with\r\nwhich the Orientalists love to break the head of Paganism. But how about\r\nthe Jews, and the exoteric religions of some Hindû sects, especially the\r\nrites of the Vallabâchâryas? For, as said, Shiva‐worship, with its Lingam\r\nand Yoni, stands too high philosophically, its modern degeneration\r\nnotwithstanding, to be called a simple phallic worship. But the Tree‐ or\r\nCross‐worship(1396) of the Jews, as denounced by their own Prophets, can\r\nhardly escape the charge. The “sons of the sorcerers, the seed of the\r\nadulterer,”(1397) as Isaiah calls them, never lost an opportunity of\r\n“enflaming themselves with idols under every green tree”(1398)—which\r\ndenotes no metaphysical recreation. It is from these _monotheistic_ Jews\r\nthat the Christian nations have derived their religion, their “God of\r\nGods, the One living God,” while despising and deriding the worship of the\r\nDeity of the ancient Philosophers. Let such believe in and worship the\r\nphysical form of the cross, by all means.\r\n\r\nBut to the follower of the true Eastern Archaic Wisdom, to him who\r\nworships in spirit nought outside the Absolute Unity, that ever‐pulsating\r\ngreat Heart that beats throughout, as in, every atom of Nature, each such\r\natom contains the germ from which he may raise the Tree of Knowledge,\r\nwhose fruits give Life Eternal and not physical life alone. For him, the\r\ncross and circle, the Tree or the Tau—even after every symbol relating\r\nthereto has been referred to and read, one after another—still remain a\r\nprofound mystery in their Past, and it is to that Past alone that he\r\ndirects his eager gaze. He cares little whether it be the Seed from which\r\ngrows the genealogical Tree of Being, called the Universe. Nor is it the\r\nThree in One, the triple aspect of the Seed—its form, colour, and\r\nsubstance—that interest him, but rather the Force which directs its\r\ngrowth, the ever mysterious, as the ever unknown. For this vital Force,\r\nthat makes the Seed germinate, burst open and throw out shoots, then form\r\nthe trunk and branches, which, in their turn, bend down like the boughs of\r\nthe Ashvattha, the holy Tree of Bodhi, throw their seed out, take root and\r\nprocreate other trees—this is the only Force that has reality for him, as\r\nit is the never‐dying Breath of Life. The Pagan philosopher sought for the\r\ncause, the modern is content with only the effects and seeks the former in\r\nthe latter. What is beyond, he does not know, nor does the modern A‐\r\ngnostic care; thus rejecting the only knowledge upon which he can with\r\nfull security base his Science. Yet this manifested Force has an answer\r\nfor him who seeks to fathom it. He who sees in the cross, the decussated\r\ncircle of Plato, the Pagan, not the antitype of circumcision, as Christian\r\n(St.) Augustine did,(1399) is forthwith regarded by the Church as a\r\nheathen; by Science, as a lunatic. This, because, while refusing to\r\nworship the God of physical generation, he confesses that he can know\r\nnothing of the Cause which underlies the so‐called _First_ Cause, the\r\nCauseless Cause of this Vital Cause. Tacitly admitting the All‐Presence of\r\nthe Boundless Circle and making of it the Universal Postulate upon which\r\nthe whole of the Manifested Universe is based, the Sage keeps a\r\nreverential silence concerning that upon which no mortal man should dare\r\nto speculate. “The Logos of God is the revealer of man, and the Logos (the\r\nVerb) of man is the revealer of God,” says Éliphas Lévi in one of his\r\nparadoxes. To this, the Eastern Occultist would reply: On this condition,\r\nhowever, that man should be dumb on the Cause that produced both God and\r\nits Logos. Otherwise, he becomes invariably the _reviler_, not the\r\n_revealer_, of the Incognizable Deity.\r\n\r\nWe have now to approach a mystery—the Hebdomad in Nature. Perchance, all\r\nthat we may say, will be attributed to coincidence. We may be told that\r\nthis number in Nature is quite _natural_—as indeed we say it is—and has no\r\nmore significance than the illusion of motion which forms the so‐called\r\n“strobic circles.” No great importance was given to these “singular\r\nillusions” when Professor Sylvanus Thompson exhibited them at the meeting\r\nof the British Association in 1877. Nevertheless we should like to learn\r\nthe scientific explanation why seven should ever form itself as a\r\npreeminent number—six concentric circles around a seventh, and seven rings\r\nwithin one another round a central point, etc.—in this _illusion_,\r\nproduced by a swaying saucer, or any other vessel. We give the solution\r\nrefused by Science in the Section which follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection XI. The Mysteries of the Hebdomad.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must not close this Part on the Symbolism of Archaic History, without\r\nan attempt to explain the perpetual recurrence of this truly mystic\r\nnumber, the Hebdomad, in every scripture known to the Orientalists. As\r\nevery religion, from the oldest to the latest, reveals its presence, and\r\nexplains it on its own grounds agreeably with its own special dogmas, this\r\nis no easy task. We can, therefore, do no better or more explanatory work\r\nthan to give a bird’s‐eye view of all. The numbers, 3, 4, 7, are the\r\nsacred numbers of Light, Life, and Union—especially in this present\r\nManvantara, our Life‐Cycle; of which number _seven_ is the special\r\nrepresentative, or the _factor_ number. This has now to be demonstrated.\r\n\r\nIf one should ask a Brâhman learned in the _Upanishads_, which are so full\r\nof the Secret Wisdom of old, why “he, of whom seven forefathers have drunk\r\nthe juice of the Moon‐plant,” is Trisuparna, as Bopaveda is credited with\r\nsaying;(1400) and why the Somapa Pitris should be worshipped by the\r\nBrâhman Trisuparna—very few could answer the question; or, if they knew,\r\nthey would still less satisfy one’s curiosity. Let us, then, hold to what\r\nthe old Esoteric Doctrine teaches. As says the Commentary:\r\n\r\n_When the first Seven appeared on Earth, they threw the seed of everything\r\nthat grows on the land into the soil. First came Three, and Four were\r\nadded to these as soon as stone was transformed into plant. Then came the\r\nsecond Seven, who, guiding the Jîvas of the plants, produced the middle\r\n[intermediate] natures between plant and moving living animal. The third\r\nSeven evolved their Chhâyâs.... The fifth Seven imprisoned their\r\nEssence.... Thus man became a Saptaparna._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Saptaparna.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch is the name given in Occult phraseology to man. It means, as shown\r\nelsewhere, a seven‐leaved plant, and the name has a great significance in\r\nthe Buddhist legends. So it had, also, under disguise, in the Greek myths.\r\nThe T, or τ (Tau), formed from the figure 7, and the Greek letter Γ\r\n(Gamma), was, as stated in the last Section, the symbol of life, and of\r\nLife Eternal: of earthly life, because Γ (Gamma) is the symbol of the\r\nEarth (Gaia)(1401); and of Life Eternal, because the figure 7 is the\r\nsymbol of the same life _linked_ with Divine Life, the double glyph\r\nexpressed in geometrical figures being:\r\n\r\n[Symbol: a triangle over a square]\r\n\r\n—a Triangle and a Quaternary, the symbol of Septenary Man.\r\n\r\nNow, the number _six_ has been regarded in the Ancient Mysteries as an\r\nemblem of _physical_ Nature. For six is the representation of the six\r\ndimensions of all bodies—the _six_ directions which compose their form,\r\nnamely, the four directions extending to the four cardinal points, North,\r\nSouth, East, and West, and the two directions of height and thickness that\r\nanswer to the Zenith and the Nadir. Therefore, while the Senary was\r\napplied by the Sages to _physical_ man, the Septenary was for them the\r\nsymbol of that man _plus_ his immortal Soul.(1402)\r\n\r\nJ. M. Ragon gives a very good illustration of the “hieroglyphical senary,”\r\nas he calls our double equilateral triangle.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The hieroglyphical senary is the symbol of the commingling of the\r\n    _philosophical three_ fires and _three_ waters, whence results the\r\n    procreation of the elements of all things.(1403)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same idea is found in the Indian double equilateral triangle. For,\r\nthough it is called in that country the sign of Vishnu, yet in truth it is\r\nthe symbol of the Triad, or Tri‐mûrti. For, even in the exoteric\r\nrendering, the lower triangle, [Symbol: triangle], with the apex downward,\r\nis the symbol of Vishnu, the God of the Moist Principle and Water,\r\nNârâyana being the Moving Principle in the Nârâ, or Waters;(1404) while\r\nthe triangle, with its apex upward, [Symbol: triangle], is Shiva, the\r\nPrinciple of Fire, symbolized by the triple flame in his hand.(1405) It is\r\nthese two interlaced triangles, wrongly called “Solomon’s Seal”—which also\r\nform the emblem of our Society—that produce the Septenary and the Triad at\r\none and the same time, and are the Decad. Whatever way this [Symbol:\r\n6‐point star] is examined, all the ten numbers are contained therein. For\r\nwith a point in the middle or centre, [Symbol: 6‐point star with middle\r\ndot], it is a _sevenfold_ sign or Septenary; its triangles denote number\r\nthree, or the Triad; the two triangles show the presence of the Binary;\r\nthe triangles with the central point common to both yield the Quaternary;\r\nthe six points are the Senary; and the central point, the Unit; the\r\nQuinary being traced by combination, as a compound of _two_ triangles, the\r\neven number, and of _three_ sides in each triangle, the first odd number.\r\nThis is the reason why Pythagoras and the ancients made the number _six_\r\nsacred to Venus, since:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The union of the two sexes, and the spagyrization of matter by\r\n    triads, are necessary to develop the generative force, that\r\n    prolific virtue and tendency to reproduction which is inherent in\r\n    all bodies.(1406)\r\n\r\n\r\nBelief in “Creators,” or the personified Powers of Nature, is in truth no\r\npolytheism, but a philosophical necessity. Like all the other Planets of\r\nour system, the Earth has seven Logoi—the emanating Rays of the one\r\n“Father‐Ray”—the Protogonos, or the Manifested Logos, he who sacrifices\r\nhis Esse (or “Flesh,” the Universe) that the World may live and every\r\ncreature therein have conscious being.\r\n\r\nNumbers 3 and 4 are respectively male and female, Spirit and Matter, and\r\ntheir union is the emblem of Life Eternal in Spirit on its ascending arc,\r\nand in Matter as the ever resurrecting Element—by procreation and\r\nreproduction. The spiritual male line is vertical [Symbol: bar]; the\r\ndifferentiated matter‐line is horizontal; the two forming the cross or ☩.\r\nThe 3 is invisible; the 4 is on the plane of objective perception. This is\r\nwhy all the Matter of the Universe, when analyzed to its ultimates by\r\nScience, can be reduced to four Elements only—Carbon, Oxygen, Nitrogen,\r\nand Hydrogen; and why the three primaries, the noumena of the four, or\r\ngraduated Spirit or Force, have remained a _terra incognita_, and mere\r\nspeculations, mere names, to exact Science. Her servants must believe in\r\nand study first the primary causes, before they can hope to fathom the\r\nnature, and acquaint themselves with the potentialities, of the effects.\r\nThus, while the men of Western learning had, and still have, the four, or\r\nMatter, to toy with, the Eastern Occultists and their disciples, the great\r\nAlchemists the world over, have the whole septenate to study from.(1407)\r\nAs those Alchemists have it:\r\n\r\n_When the Three and the Four kiss each other, the Quaternary joins its\r\nmiddle nature with that of the Triangle [or Triad, i.e., the face of one\r\nof its plane surfaces becoming the middle face of the other], and becomes\r\na Cube; then only does it [the Cube unfolded] become the vehicle and the\r\nnumber of Life, the Father‐Mother Seven._\r\n\r\nNow we are taught that all these earliest forms of organic life also\r\nappear in septenary groups of numbers. From minerals or “soft stones that\r\nhardened,” to use the phraseology of the Stanzas, followed by the “hard\r\nplants that softened,” which are the product of the mineral, for “it is\r\nfrom the bosom of the stone that vegetation is born”;(1408) and then to\r\nman—all the primitive models in every kingdom of Nature begin by being\r\nethereal, transparent, films. This, of course, takes place only in the\r\nfirst beginning of life. With the next period they consolidate, and at the\r\n_seventh_ begin to branch off into species, _all except men_, the first of\r\nthe mammalian animals(1409) in the Fourth Round.\r\n\r\nVirgil, versed as every ancient poet was, more or less, in Esoteric\r\nPhilosophy, sang of evolution in the following strains:\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Principio cælum ac terras camposque liquentes_\r\n    Lucentemque globum Lunæ, Titaniaque astra\r\n    _Spiritus_ intus alit, totamque infusa per artus\r\n    _Mens_ agitat molem et magno se corpore miscet.\r\n    Inde hominum pecudumque genus vitæque volantum\r\n    Et quæ marmoreo fert monstra sub æquore pontus.(1410)\r\n\r\n\r\n“First came three, or the Triangle.” This expression has a profound\r\nmeaning in Occultism, and the fact is corroborated, in Mineralogy, Botany,\r\nand even in Geology—as has been demonstrated in the Section on “The\r\nChronology of the Brâhmans”—by the compound number seven, the three and\r\nthe four, being contained in it. Salt in solution proves this. For when\r\nits molecules, clustering together, begin to deposit themselves as a\r\nsolid, the first shape they assume is that of triangles, of small pyramids\r\nand cones. It is the figure of Fire, whence the word “Pyramis”; while the\r\nsecond geometrical figure in _manifested_ Nature is a Square or a Cube, 4\r\nand 6; for, as Enfield says, “the particles of earth being cubical, those\r\nof fire are pyramidal”—truly. The pyramidal shape is that assumed by the\r\npines—the most primitive tree after the fern period. Thus the two\r\nopposites in cosmic Nature—fire and water, heat and cold—begin their\r\nmetrographical manifestations, one by a trimetric, the other by a\r\nhexagonal system. For the stellate crystals of snow, viewed under a\r\nmicroscope, are all and each of them a double or a treble six‐pointed\r\nstar, with a central nucleus, like a miniature star within the larger one.\r\nSays Mr. Darwin—showing that the inhabitants of the sea‐shore are greatly\r\naffected by the tides:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The most ancient progenitors in the kingdom of the Vertebrata ...\r\n    apparently consisted of a group of marine animals.... Animals\r\n    living either about the _mean_ high‐water mark, or about the\r\n    _mean_ low‐water mark, pass through a complete cycle of tidal\r\n    changes in a fortnight.... Now it is a mysterious fact that in the\r\n    higher and now terrestrial Vertebrata ... many normal and abnormal\r\n    processes have one or more weeks [septenates] as their periods ...\r\n    such as gestation of mammals, the duration of fevers.(1411)\r\n\r\n    The eggs of the pigeon are hatched in two weeks [or 14 days];\r\n    those of the fowl in three; those of the duck in four; those of\r\n    the goose in five; and those of the ostrich in seven.(1412)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis number is closely connected with the Moon, whose Occult influence is\r\never manifesting itself in septenary periods. It is the Moon which is the\r\nguide of the Occult side of terrestrial Nature, while the Sun is the\r\nregulator and factor of manifested life. This truth has ever been evident\r\nto the Seers and the Adepts. Jakob Böhme, by insisting on the fundamental\r\ndoctrine of the seven properties of everlasting Mother Nature, proved\r\nhimself thereby a great Occultist.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the consideration of the septenary in ancient religious\r\nsymbolism. To the metrological key of the symbolism of the Hebrews, which\r\nreveals numerically the geometrical relations of the Circle (All‐Deity) to\r\nthe Square, Cube, Triangle, and all the integral emanations of the divine\r\narea, may be added the theogonic key. This key explains that Noah, the\r\nDeluge‐Patriarch, is in one aspect the permutation of the Deity (the\r\nUniversal Creative Law), for the purpose of the formation of our Earth,\r\nits population, and the propagation of life on it, in general.\r\n\r\nNow bearing in mind the septenary division in divine Hierarchies, as in\r\ncosmic and human constitutions, the student will readily understand that\r\nJah‐Noah is at the head of, and is the synthesis of the lower cosmic\r\nQuaternary. The upper Sephirothal Triad, △—of which Jehovah‐Binah\r\n(Intelligence) is the left, female, angle—emanates the Quaternary, □. The\r\nlatter, symbolizing by itself the Heavenly Man, the sexless Adam Kadmon,\r\nviewed as Nature in the abstract, becomes a septenate again by emanating\r\nfrom itself the additional three principles, the lower terrestrial or\r\nmanifested physical Nature, Matter and our Earth—the seventh being\r\nMalkuth, the “Bride of the Heavenly Man”—thus forming, with the higher\r\nTriad, or Kether, the Crown, the full number of the Sephirothal Tree—the\r\n10, the Total in Unity, or the Universe. Apart from the higher Triad, the\r\nlower creative Sephiroth are seven.\r\n\r\nThe above is not directly to our point, though it is a necessary reminder\r\nto facilitate the comprehension of what follows. The question at issue is\r\nto show that Jah‐Noah, or the Jehovah of the Hebrew _Bible_, the alleged\r\nCreator of our Earth, of man and all upon it, is:\r\n\r\n(_a_) The lowest Septenary, the Creative Elohim—in his cosmic aspect.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The Tetragrammaton or the Adam Kadmon, the “Heavenly Man” of the\r\nfour letters—in his theogonic and kabalistic aspects.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The Noah—identical with the Hindû Shishta, the human Seed, left for\r\nthe peopling of the Earth from a previous creation, or Manvantara, as\r\nexpressed in the _Purânas_, or the pre‐diluvian period as rendered\r\nallegorically in the _Bible_—in his cosmic character.\r\n\r\nBut whether a Quaternary (Tetragrammaton) or a Triad, the biblical\r\nCreative God is not the Universal 10, unless blended with Ain Suph (as\r\nBrahmâ with Parabrahman), but a septenary, one of the many septenaries of\r\nthe Universal Septenate. In the explanation of the question now in hand,\r\nhis position and status as Noah may best be shown by placing the 3, △, and\r\n4, □, on parallel lines with the cosmic and human principles. For the\r\nlatter, the old familiar classification is made use of.\r\n\r\nAs an additional demonstration of the statement, let the reader turn to\r\nkabalistic works.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “_Ararat_ = _the mount of descent_ = הר‐י‐רד, _Hor‐Jared_. Hatho\r\n    mentions it out of composition by _Arath_ = ארת. Editor of Moses\r\n    Cherenensis says: ‘By this, they say, is signified _the first\r\n    place of descent_ (of the ark).’ ” (Bryant’s _Anal._, vol. iv. pp.\r\n    5, 6, 15.) Under “_Berge_,” _mountain_, Nork says of _Ararat_:\r\n    “אררט, for ארת (_i.e._, _Ararat_ for _Arath_) _earth, Aramaic_\r\n    reduplication.” Here it is seen that Nork and Hatho make use of\r\n    the same equivalent, in Arath, ארש, with the meaning of\r\n    _earth_.(1413)\r\n\r\n\r\nNoah thus symbolizing both the Root‐Manu and the Seed‐Manu, or the Power\r\nwhich developed the Planetary Chain, and our Earth, and the Seed‐Race, the\r\nFifth, which was saved while the last sub‐races of the Fourth, Vaivasvata\r\nManu, perished, the number _seven_ will be seen to recur at every step. It\r\nis Noah who, as Jehovah’s permutation, represents the septenary Host of\r\nthe Elohim, and is thus the Father or Creator (the Preserver) of all\r\nanimal life. Hence the verses of _Genesis_: “Of every clean beast thou\r\nshalt take to thee by sevens, the male [3], and the female [4]; of fowls\r\nalso of the air by sevens,”(1414) etc., followed by all the _sevening_ of\r\ndays and the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB. The Tetraktys In Relation To The Heptagon.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus number _seven_, as a compound of 3 and 4, is the factor element in\r\nevery ancient religion, because it is _the factor element in Nature_. Its\r\nadoption must be justified, and it must be shown to be _the_ number _par\r\nexcellence_, for, since the appearance of _Esoteric Buddhism_, frequent\r\nobjections have been made, and doubts expressed as to the correctness of\r\nthese assertions.\r\n\r\nAnd here let the student be told at once, that in all such numerical\r\ndivisions the One universal Principle—although referred to as (the) one,\r\nbecause the Only One—never enters into the calculations. It stands, in its\r\ncharacter of the Absolute, the Infinite, and the Universal Abstraction,\r\nentirely by Itself and independent of every other Power whether noumenal\r\nor phenomenal. Says the author of the article “Personal and Impersonal\r\nGod”:\r\n\r\n\r\n    This entity is neither matter nor spirit; it is neither Ego nor\r\n    non‐Ego; and it is neither object nor subject.\r\n\r\n    In the language of Hindû philosophers it is the original and\r\n    eternal combination of Purusha [Spirit] and Prakriti [Matter]. As\r\n    the Advaitîs hold that an external object is merely the product of\r\n    our mental states, Prakriti is nothing more than illusion, and\r\n    Purusha is the only reality; it is the _one_ existence which\r\n    remains in the universe of Ideas. This ... then, is the\r\n    Parabrahman of the Advaitîs. Even if there were to be a personal\r\n    God with anything like a material Upâdhi (physical basis of\r\n    whatever form), from the standpoint of an Advaitî there will be as\r\n    much reason to doubt his noumenal existence, as there would be in\r\n    the case of any other object. In their opinion, a conscious God\r\n    cannot be the origin of the universe, as his Ego would be the\r\n    effect of a previous cause, if the word conscious conveys but its\r\n    ordinary meaning. They cannot admit that _the grand total of all\r\n    the states of consciousness in the universe_ is their deity, as\r\n    these states are constantly changing, and as cosmic idealism\r\n    ceases during Pralaya. There is only one permanent condition in\r\n    the Universe, which is the state of perfect unconsciousness, bare\r\n    Chidâkâsham (the field of consciousness) in fact.\r\n\r\n    When my readers once realize the fact that this grand universe is\r\n    in reality but a huge aggregation of various states of\r\n    consciousness, they will not be surprised to find that the\r\n    ultimate state of unconsciousness is considered as Parabrahman by\r\n    the Advaitîs.(1415)\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough itself entirely out of human reckoning or calculation, yet this\r\n“huge aggregation of various states of consciousness” is a septenate, in\r\n_its_ totality entirely composed of septenary groups—simply because “the\r\ncapacity of perception _exists in seven different aspects corresponding to\r\nthe seven conditions of matter_,”(1416) or the seven properties, or states\r\nof matter. And, therefore, the series from one to seven, begins in the\r\nEsoteric calculations with the first manifested principle, which is number\r\none if we commence from above, and number seven when reckoning from below,\r\nor from the lowest principle.\r\n\r\nThe Tetrad is esteemed in the _Kabalah_, as it was by Pythagoras, the most\r\nperfect, or rather _sacred_ number, because it emanated from the One, the\r\nfirst manifested Unit, or rather the Three in One. And the latter has ever\r\nbeen impersonal, sexless, incomprehensible, though within the possibility\r\nof the higher mental perceptions.\r\n\r\nThe first manifestation of the eternal Monad was never meant to stand as\r\nthe symbol of another symbol, the Unborn for the Element‐born, or the one\r\nLogos for the Heavenly Man. Tetragrammaton, or the Tetraktys of the\r\nGreeks, is the Second Logos, the Demiurgos.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Tetrad, as Thomas Taylor thinks, is, however, the _animal\r\n    itself_ of Plato who, as Syrianus justly observes, was the best of\r\n    the Pythagoreans; subsists at the extremity of the intelligible\r\n    triad, as is most satisfactorily shown by Proclus in the third\r\n    book of his treatise on the theology of Plato. And between these\r\n    two triads [the double triangle], the one intelligible, and the\r\n    other intellectual, another order of gods exists, which partakes\r\n    of both extremes.(1417)...\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pythagorean world, according to Plutarch,(1418) _consisted of a double\r\nquaternary_.\r\n\r\nThis statement corroborates what is said about the choice, by the exoteric\r\ntheologies, of the _lower_ Tetraktys. For:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The quaternary of the intellectual world [the world of Mahat] is\r\n    T’Agathon, Nous, Psyche, Hyle; while that of the sensible world\r\n    [of Matter], which is properly what Pythagoras meant by the word\r\n    Kosmos, is Fire, Air, Water, and Earth. The four elements are\r\n    called by the name of _rhizômata_, the roots or principles of all\r\n    _mixed bodies_.(1419)\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is to say, the lower Tetraktys is the root of _illusion_, of the\r\nWorld of Matter; and this is the Tetragrammaton of the Jews, and the\r\n“mysterious deity,” over which the modern Kabalists make such a fuss!\r\n\r\n\r\n    This number [_four_] forms the arithmetical mean between the monad\r\n    and the heptad; and this comprehends all powers, both of the\r\n    productive and produced numbers; for this, of all numbers under\r\n    ten, is made of a certain number; the duad doubled makes a tetrad,\r\n    and the tetrad doubled [or unfolded] makes the hebdomad [the\r\n    septenary]. Two multiplied into itself produces four; and retorted\r\n    into itself makes the first cube. This first cube is a _fertile\r\n    number_, the ground of multitude and variety, constituted of two\r\n    and four [depending on the monad, the _seventh_]. Thus the two\r\n    principles of temporal things, the pyramis and cube, form and\r\n    matter, flow from one fountain, the tetragon [on earth, the monad,\r\n    in heaven].(1420)\r\n\r\n\r\nHere Reuchlin, the great authority on the _Kabalah_, shows the cube to be\r\n“matter,” whereas the pyramid or the triad is “form.” With the Hermesians\r\nthe number four becomes the symbol of truth only when _amplified into a\r\ncube_, which, unfolded, makes seven, as symbolizing the male and female\r\nelements and the element of Life.(1421)\r\n\r\nSome students have been puzzled to account for the vertical line,(1422)\r\nwhich is male, becoming, in the cross, a four‐partitioned line (_four_\r\nbeing a female number), while the horizontal (the line of matter) becomes\r\nthree‐divisioned. But this is easy of explanation. Since the middle face\r\nof the “cube unfolded” is _common_ to both the vertical and the horizontal\r\nbar, or double‐line, it becomes _neutral_ ground so to say, and belongs to\r\nneither. The spirit line remains triadic, and the matter line two‐fold—two\r\nbeing an even and therefore a female number also. Moreover, according to\r\nTheon in his _Mathematica_, the Pythagoreans, who gave the name of Harmony\r\nto the Tetraktys, “because it is a diatessaron in sesquitertia,” were of\r\nopinion that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The division of the canon of the monochord was made by the\r\n    tetraktys in the duad, triad, and tetrad; for it comprehends a\r\n    sesquitertia, a sesquialtera, a duple, a triple, and a quadruple\r\n    proportion, the section of which is 27. In the ancient musical\r\n    notation, the tetrachord consisted of _three_ degrees or\r\n    intervals, and _four_ terms of sounds called by the Greeks\r\n    diatessaron, and by us a fourth.(1423)\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, the quaternary though an even, therefore a female (“infernal”)\r\nnumber, varied according to its form. This is shown by Stanley.(1424) The\r\nfour was called by the Pythagoreans the Key‐Keeper of Nature; but in union\r\nwith the three, which made it seven, it became the most perfect and\r\nharmonious number—_nature herself_. The four was “the masculine of\r\nfeminine form,” when forming the cross; and seven is the “Master of the\r\nMoon,” for this Planet is forced to alter her appearance every seven days.\r\nIt is on number seven that Pythagoras composed his doctrine on the Harmony\r\nand Music of the Spheres, calling a “tone” the distance of the Moon from\r\nthe Earth; from the Moon to Mercury half a tone, from thence to Venus the\r\nsame; from Venus to the Sun one and a half tones; from the Sun to Mars a\r\ntone; from thence to Jupiter half a tone; from Jupiter to Saturn half a\r\ntone; and thence to the Zodiac a tone; thus making seven tones—the\r\ndiapason harmony.(1425) All the melody of Nature is in those seven tones,\r\nand therefore is called the “Voice of Nature.”\r\n\r\nPlutarch explains(1426) that the most ancient Greeks regarded the Tetrad\r\nas the root and principle of all things, since it was the number of the\r\nelements which gave birth to all visible and invisible _created_\r\nthings.(1427) With the brothers of the Rosy Cross, the figure of the\r\ncross, or _cube unfolded_, formed the subject of a disquisition in one of\r\nthe Theosophic degrees of Peuvret, and was treated according to the\r\nfundamental principles of light and darkness, _or good and evil_.(1428)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The intelligible world proceeds out of the divine mind [or unit]\r\n    after this manner. The Tetraktys, reflecting upon its own essence,\r\n    _the first unit, productrix of all things_, and on its own\r\n    beginning, saith thus: Once one, twice two, immediately ariseth a\r\n    tetrad, having on its top the highest unit, and _becomes a\r\n    Pyramis_, whose base is a plain tetrad, answerable to a\r\n    superficies, upon which the radiant light of the divine unity\r\n    produceth the form of incorporeal fire, by reason of the descent\r\n    of Juno (matter) to inferior things. Hence ariseth essential\r\n    light, not burning but illuminating. This is _the creation of the\r\n    middle world_, which the Hebrews call the _Supreme_, the world of\r\n    the [_their_] deity. It is termed Olympus, entirely light, and\r\n    replete with separate forms, where is the seat of the immortal\r\n    gods, _deûm domus alta_, whose top is _unity_, its wall _trinity_,\r\n    and its superficies _quaternity_.(1429)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “superficies” has thus to remain a _meaningless surface_, if left by\r\nitself. _Unity_ only “illuminating” _quaternity_, the famous lower four\r\nhas to build for itself also a wall from _trinity_, if it would be\r\nmanifested. Moreover, the Tetragrammaton, or Microprosopus, is “Jehovah”\r\narrogating to himself very improperly the “Was, Is, Will Be,” now\r\ntranslated into the “I am that I am,” and interpreted as referring to the\r\nhighest abstract Deity; while Esoterically and in plain truth, it means\r\nonly periodically chaotic, turbulent, and eternal Matter, with all its\r\npotentialities. For the Tetragrammaton is one with Nature, or Isis, and is\r\nthe exoteric series of androgyne Gods such as Osiris‐Isis, Jove‐Juno,\r\nBrahmâ‐Vâch, or the Kabalistic Jah‐Hovah; all male‐females. Every\r\nanthropomorphic God, in old nations, as Marcellus Ficin well observed, has\r\nhis name written with four letters. Thus with the Egyptians, he was Teut;\r\nthe Arabs, Alla; the Persians, Sire; the Magi, Orsi; the Mahometans, Abdi;\r\nthe Greeks, Teos; the ancient Turks, Esar; the Latins, Deus; to which John\r\nLorenzo Anania adds the German Gott; the Sarmatian Bouh; etc.(1430)\r\n\r\nThe Monad being one, and an _odd_ number, the Ancients therefore said that\r\nthe odd were the only perfect numbers; and—selfishly, perhaps, yet as a\r\nfact—considered them all as masculine and perfect, being applicable to the\r\n_celestial_ Gods, while even numbers, such as two, four, six, and\r\nespecially eight, as being female, were regarded as imperfect, and given\r\nonly to the _terrestrial and infernal_ Deities. Virgil records the fact by\r\nsaying, “_Numero deus impare gaudet_.” “The God is pleased with an odd\r\nnumber.”(1431)\r\n\r\nBut number _seven_, or the Heptagon, the Pythagoreans considered to be a\r\n_religious and perfect number_. It was called Telesphoros, because by it\r\nall in the Universe and mankind is led _to its end_, _i.e._, its\r\nculmination.(1432) The doctrine of the Spheres ruled by the seven Sacred\r\nPlanets(1433) shows, from Lemuria to Pythagoras, the seven Powers of\r\nterrestrial and sublunary Nature, as well as the seven great Forces of the\r\nUniverse, proceeding and evolving in seven tones, which are the seven\r\nnotes of the musical scale.\r\n\r\nThe Heptad [our Septenary] was considered to be _the number of a virgin,\r\nbecause it is unborn_ [like the Logos or the Aja of the Vedântins]:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Without a father ... or a mother, ... _but proceeding directly\r\n    from the monad_, which is the origin and crown of all\r\n    things.(1434)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd if the Heptad is made to proceed from the Monad directly, then it is,\r\nas taught in the Secret Doctrine of the oldest schools, the perfect and\r\nsacred number of this Mahâmanvantara of ours.\r\n\r\nThe Septenary, or Heptad, was sacred indeed to several Gods and Goddesses;\r\nto Mars, with his seven attendants, to Osiris, whose body was divided into\r\nseven and twice seven parts; to Apollo, the Sun, amid his seven planets,\r\nand playing the hymn to the seven‐rayed on his seven‐stringed harp; to\r\nMinerva, the fatherless and the motherless, and others.(1435)\r\n\r\nCis‐Himâlayan Occultism with its sevening, and because of such sevening,\r\nmust be regarded as the most ancient, the original of all. It is opposed\r\nby _some_ fragments left by Neo‐Platonists; and the admirers of the\r\nlatter, who hardly understand what they defend, say to us: See, your\r\nforerunners believed only in _triple_ man, composed of Spirit, Soul, and\r\nBody. Behold, the Târaka Râja Yoga of India limits that division to 3, we,\r\nto 4, and the Vedântins to 5 (Koshas). To this, we of the Archaic school\r\nask:\r\n\r\nWhy then does the Greek poet say that it is not four but _seven_ who sing\r\nthe praise of the Spiritual Sun?\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ἑπτά με κ.τ.λ.\r\n    Seven sounding letters sing the praise of me,\r\n    The immortal God, the almighty Deity.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy again is the _triune_ Iao, the Mystery God, called the “fourfold,” and\r\nyet the triadic and tetradic symbols come under one unified name with the\r\nChristians—the Jehovah of the seven letters? Why again in the Hebrew Shebâ\r\nis the Oath (the Pythagorean Tetraktys) identical with number 7? Or, as\r\nMr. Gerald Massey has it:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Taking an oath was synonymous with “to seven,” and the 10\r\n    expressed by the letter Jod, was the full number of Iao‐Sabaoth\r\n    [—the ten‐lettered God].(1436)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Lucian’s _Auction_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Pythagoras asks, “How do you reckon?” The reply is, “One, Two,\r\n    Three, Four.” Then Pythagoras says, “Do you see? In _what you\r\n    conceive_ Four there are Ten, _a perfect Triangle and our Oath_\r\n    [Tetraktys, Four!—or Seven in all].”(1437)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy again does Proclus say:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Father of the golden verses celebrates the Tetraktys as the\r\n    fountain of perennial nature?(1438)\r\n\r\n\r\nSimply because those Western Kabalists who quote the _exoteric_ proofs\r\nagainst us have no idea of the real _Esoteric_ meaning. All the ancient\r\nCosmologies—the oldest Cosmographies of the two most ancient people of the\r\nFifth Root‐Race, the Hindû Âryans and the Egyptians, together with the\r\nearly Chinese races, the remnants of the Fourth or Atlantean Race—based\r\nthe whole of their Mysteries on number 10; the higher Triangle standing\r\nfor the invisible and metaphysical World, the lower three and four, or the\r\nSeptenate, for the physical Realm. It is not the Jewish _Bible_ that\r\nbrought number seven into prominence. Hesiod used the words, “the seventh\r\nis the sacred day,” before the Sabbath of “Moses” was ever heard of. The\r\nuse of number seven was never confined to any one nation. This is well\r\ntestified by the seven vases in the Temple of the Sun, near the ruins of\r\nBabian in Upper Egypt; the seven fires burning continually for ages before\r\nthe altars of Mithra; the seven holy fanes of the Arabians; the seven\r\npeninsulas, the seven islands, seven seas, mountains, and rivers of India;\r\nand of the _Zohar_; the Jewish Sephiroth of the seven splendours; the\r\nseven Gothic deities; the seven worlds of the Chaldæans and their seven\r\nSpirits; the seven constellations mentioned by Hesiod and Homer; and all\r\nthe interminable sevens which the Orientalists find in every MS. they\r\ndiscover.(1439)\r\n\r\nWhat we have to say finally is this: Enough has been brought forward to\r\nshow why the human principles were and are divided in the Esoteric Schools\r\ninto seven. Make it four and it will either leave man _minus_ his lower\r\nterrestrial elements, or, if viewed from a physical standpoint, make of\r\nhim a soulless animal. The Quaternary must be the higher or the lower—the\r\ncelestial or terrestrial Tetraktys; to become comprehensible, according to\r\nthe teachings of the _ancient_ Esoteric School, man must be regarded as a\r\nseptenary. This was so well understood, that even the so‐called Christian\r\nGnostics adopted this time‐honoured system.(1440) This remained for a long\r\ntime a secret, for though it was suspected, no MSS. of that time spoke of\r\nit clearly enough to satisfy the sceptic. But there comes to our rescue\r\nthe literary curiosity of our age—the oldest and best preserved Gospel of\r\nthe Gnostics, _Pistis Sophia_. To make the proof absolutely complete, we\r\nshall quote from an authority, C. W. King, the only Archæologist who has\r\nhad a faint glimmer of this elaborate doctrine, and the best writer of the\r\nday on the Gnostics and their gems.\r\n\r\nAccording to this extraordinary piece of religious literature—a true\r\nGnostic fossil—the human Entity is the Septenary Ray from the One,(1441)\r\njust as our School teaches. It is composed of seven elements, four of\r\nwhich are borrowed from the four kabalistical manifested worlds. Thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    From Asiah it gets the Nephesh, or seat of the physical appetites\r\n    [vital breath, also]; from Jezirah, the Ruach, or seat of the\r\n    passions [? !]; from Briah, the Neshamah or reason; and from\r\n    Aziluth it obtains the Chaiah, or principle of spiritual life.\r\n    This looks like an adaptation of the Platonic theory of the Soul’s\r\n    obtaining its respective faculties from the Planets in its\r\n    downward progress through their spheres. But the Pistis‐Sophia,\r\n    with its accustomed boldness, puts this theory into a much more\r\n    poetical shape (§ 282). The _Inner Man_ is similarly made up of\r\n    _four_ constituents, _but these are supplied by the rebellious\r\n    Æons of the Spheres_, being the _Power_—a particle of the Divine\r\n    light (“Divinæ particula auræ”) yet left in themselves; the _Soul_\r\n    [the fifth] “formed out of the tears of their eyes, and the sweat\r\n    of their torments”; the Ἀντιμῖμον Πνεύματος, _Counterfeit of the\r\n    Spirit_ (seemingly answering to our _Conscience_) [_the sixth_];\r\n    and lastly the Μοῖρα, _Fate_(1442) [Karmic Ego], whose business it\r\n    is to lead the man to the end appointed for him: if he hath to die\r\n    by the fire, to lead him into the fire; if he hath to die by a\r\n    wild beast, to lead him unto the wild beast—[the _seventh_]!(1443)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC. The Septenary Element In The Vedas.\r\n\r\n\r\n_It Corroborates the Occult Teaching Concerning the Seven Globes and the\r\nSeven Races._\r\n\r\nWe have to go to the very source of historical information, if we would\r\nbring our best evidence to testify to the facts enunciated. For, though\r\nentirely allegorical, the Rig Vedic hymns are none the less suggestive.\r\nThe seven Rays of Sûrya, the Sun, are therein made parallel to the seven\r\nWorlds, of every Planetary Chain, to the seven Rivers of Heaven and Earth,\r\nthe former being the seven creative Hosts, and the latter the seven Men,\r\nor primitive human groups. The seven ancient Rishis—the progenitors of all\r\nthat lives and breathes on Earth—are the seven friends of Agni, his seven\r\n“Horses,” or seven “Heads.” The human race has sprung from Fire and Water,\r\nit is allegorically stated; fashioned by the Fathers, or the Ancestor‐\r\nsacrificers, from Agni; for Agni, the Ashvins, the Âdityas,(1444) are all\r\nsynonymous with those “Sacrificers,” or the Fathers, variously called\r\nPitaras (or Pitris), Angirasas,(1445) and Sâdhyas, “Divine Sacrificers,”\r\nthe most Occult of all. They are all called Deva‐putra Rishayah or the\r\n“Sons of God.”(1446) The “Sacrificers,” moreover, are collectively the One\r\nSacrificer, the Father of the Gods, Vishvakarman, who performed the great\r\nSarva‐medha ceremony, and ended by sacrificing himself.\r\n\r\nIn these Hymns the “Heavenly Man” is called Purusha, the “Man,”(1447) from\r\nwhom Virâj was born(1448); and from Virâj, the (mortal) man. It is\r\nVaruna—lowered from his sublime position to be the chief of the\r\nLords—Dhyânîs or Devas—who regulates all natural phenomena, who “makes a\r\npath for the Sun, for him to follow.” The seven Rivers of the Sky (the\r\ndescending Creative Gods), and the seven Rivers of the Earth (the seven\r\nprimitive Mankinds), are under his control, as will be seen. For he who\r\nbreaks Varuna’s laws (Vratâni, or “courses of natural action,” active\r\nlaws), is punished by Indra(1449) the Vedic powerful God, whose Vrata, or\r\nlaw or power, is greater than the Vratâni of any other God.\r\n\r\nThus, the _Rig Veda_, the oldest of _all the known_ ancient records, may\r\nbe shown to corroborate the Occult Teachings in almost every respect. Its\r\nHymns, which are the records written by the earliest Initiates of the\r\nFifth (our) Race concerning the Primordial Teachings, speak of the Seven\r\nRaces (two still to come), allegorizing them by the seven “Streams”(1450)\r\nand of the Five Races (Panchakrishtayah) which have already inhabited this\r\nworld(1451) on the five Regions (Panchapradishah)(1452) as also of the\r\nthree Continents that were.(1453)\r\n\r\nIt is only those scholars who will master the secret meaning of the\r\nPurusha Sukta—in which the intuition of the modern Orientalists has chosen\r\nto see “one of the very latest hymns of the _Rig Veda_”—who may hope to\r\nunderstand how harmonious are its teachings and how corroborative of the\r\nEsoteric Doctrines. He must study, in all the abstruseness of their\r\nmetaphysical meaning, the relations therein between the (Heavenly) Man\r\n(Purusha), _sacrificed_ for the production of the Universe and all in\r\nit,(1454) and the terrestrial mortal man(1455) before he realizes the\r\nhidden philosophy of the verse:\r\n\r\n\r\n    15. He [“Man,” Purusha, or Vishvakarman] had seven enclosing logs\r\n    of fuel, and _thrice seven_ layers of fuel; when the Gods\r\n    performed the sacrifice, they bound the Man as victim.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis relates to the three septenary primeval Races, and shows the\r\nantiquity of the _Vedas_, which knew of no other sacrifice, probably, in\r\nthese earliest _oral_ teachings; and also to the seven primeval groups of\r\nMankind, as Vishvakarman represents divine Humanity collectively.(1456)\r\n\r\nThe same doctrine is found reflected in the other old religions. It may,\r\nit must, have come down to us disfigured and misinterpreted, as in the\r\ncase of the Parsîs who read it in their _Vendîdâd_ and elsewhere, though\r\nwithout understanding the allusions therein contained any better than do\r\nthe Orientalists; yet the doctrine is plainly mentioned in their old\r\nworks.(1457)\r\n\r\nComparing the Esoteric Teaching with the interpretations by Prof. James\r\nDarmesteter, one may see at a glance where the mistake is made, and the\r\ncause that produced it. The passage runs thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Indo‐Iranian Asura [Ahura] was often conceived as _sevenfold_;\r\n    by the play of certain mythical [?] formulæ and the strength of\r\n    certain mythical [?] numbers, the ancestors of the Indo‐Iranians\r\n    had been led to speak of seven worlds,(1458) and the supreme god\r\n    was often made sevenfold, as well as the worlds over which he\r\n    ruled. The seven worlds became in Persia the seven Karshvare of\r\n    the earth: the earth is divided into seven Karshvare, _only one of\r\n    which is known and accessible to man_, the one on which we live,\r\n    namely, Hvaniratha; which amounts to saying that there are _seven\r\n    earths_.(1459) Parsi mythology knows also of seven heavens.\r\n    Hvaniratha itself is divided into seven climes. (Orm. Ahr. §\r\n    72.)(1460)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same division and doctrine is to be found in the oldest and most\r\nrevered of the Hindû scriptures—the _Rig Veda_. Mention is made therein of\r\nsix Worlds, _besides_ our Earth: the six Rajamsi above Prithivî, the\r\nEarth, or “this” (Idam) as opposed to “that which is _yonder_” (_i.e._,\r\nthe six Globes on the _three_ other planes or Worlds).(1461)\r\n\r\nThe italics are ours to point out the identity of the tenets with those of\r\nthe Esoteric Doctrine, and to accentuate the mistake that is made. The\r\nMagi or Mazdeans only believed in what other people believed in: namely,\r\nin seven “Worlds” or Globes of our Planetary Chain, of which _only one_ is\r\naccessible to man, at the present time, our Earth; and in the successive\r\nappearance and destruction of seven Continents or Earths on this our\r\nGlobe, each Continent being divided, in commemoration of the seven Globes\r\n(one visible, six invisible), into seven islands or continents, seven\r\n“climes,” etc. This was a common belief in those days when the now Secret\r\nDoctrine was open to all. It is this multiplicity of localities in\r\nseptenary divisions, which has made the Orientalists—who have, moreover,\r\nbeen further led astray by the oblivion of their primitive doctrines of\r\nboth the uninitiated Hindûs and Parsîs—feel so puzzled by this ever‐\r\nrecurring seven‐fold number as to regard it as “mythical.” It is this\r\noblivion of first principles which has led the Orientalists off the right\r\ntrack and made them commit the greatest blunders. The same failure is\r\nfound in the definition of the Gods. Those who are ignorant of the\r\nEsoteric Doctrine of the earliest Âryans, can never assimilate or even\r\nunderstand correctly the metaphysical meaning contained in these Beings.\r\n\r\nAhura Mazda (Ormazd) was the head and synthesis of the seven Amesha\r\nSpentas, or Amshaspands, and, therefore, an Amesha Spenta himself. Just as\r\nJehovah‐Binah‐Elohim was the head and synthesis of the Elohim, and no\r\nmore; so Agni‐Vishnu‐Sûrya was the synthesis and head, or the focus whence\r\nemanated in physics and also in metaphysics, from the spiritual as well as\r\nfrom the physical Sun, the seven Rays, the seven Fiery Tongues, the seven\r\nPlanets or Gods. All these became supreme Gods and _the_ One God, but only\r\nafter the loss of the primeval secrets; _i.e._, the sinking of Atlantis,\r\nor the “Flood,” and the occupation of India by the Brâhmans, who sought\r\nsafety on the summits of the Himâlayas, for even the high table‐lands of\r\nwhat is now Tibet became submerged for a time. Ahura Mazda is addressed\r\nonly as the “Most Blissful Spirit, Creator of the _Corporeal_ World” in\r\nthe _Vendîdâd_. Ahura Mazda in its literal translation means the “Wise\r\nLord” (Ahura “lord” and Mazda “wise”). Moreover, this name of Ahura, in\r\nSanskrit Asura, connects him with the Mânasaputras, the Sons of Wisdom who\r\ninformed the mindless man, and endowed him with his mind (Manas). Ahura\r\n(Asura) may be derived from the root _ah_ “to be,” but in its primal\r\nsignification it is what the Secret Teaching shows it to be.\r\n\r\nWhen Geology shall have found out how many thousands of years ago the\r\ndisturbed waters of the Indian Ocean reached the highest plateaux of\r\nCentral Asia, when the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf made one with it,\r\nthen only will they know the age of the existing Âryan Brâhmanical nation,\r\nand also the time of its descent into the plains of Hindûstan, which did\r\nnot take place till millenniums later.\r\n\r\nYima, the so‐called “first man” in the _Vendîdâd_, as much as his twin‐\r\nbrother Yama, the son of Vaivasvata Manu, belongs to two epochs of\r\nUniversal History. He is the Progenitor of the Second human Race, hence\r\nthe personification of the Shadows of the Pitris, and the Father of the\r\nPostdiluvian Humanity. The Magi said, “Yima,” as we say “man” when\r\nspeaking of mankind. The “fair Yima,” the first mortal who converses with\r\nAhura Mazda, is the _first _“man”_ who dies_ or disappears, not the first\r\nwho is born. The “son of Vîvanghat”(1462) was, like the son of Vaivasvata,\r\nthe symbolical man, who stood in Esotericism as the representative of the\r\n_first three_ Races and the collective Progenitor thereof. Of these Races\r\nthe first two never died(1463) but only vanished, absorbed in their\r\nprogeny, and the Third knew death only towards its close, after the\r\nseparation of the sexes and its “Fall” into generation. This is plainly\r\nalluded to in Fargard ii of the _Vendîdâd_. Yima refuses to become the\r\nbearer of the law of Ahura Mazda, saying:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “I was not born, I was not taught to be the preacher and the\r\n    bearer of thy law.”(1464)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then Ahura Mazda asks him to make his men increase and “watch over”\r\nhis world.\r\n\r\nHe refuses to become the priest of Ahura Mazda, because he is _his own\r\npriest and sacrificer_, but he accepts the second proposal. He is made to\r\nanswer:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Yes!... Yes, I will nourish, and rule, and watch over thy world.\r\n    There shall be, while I am king, neither cold wind nor hot wind,\r\n    _neither disease nor death_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThen Ahura Mazda brings him a golden ring and a poniard, the emblems of\r\nsovereignty.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Thus, under the sway of Yima, three hundred _winters_ passed away,\r\n    and the earth was _replenished_ with flocks and herds, with men\r\n    and dogs and birds and with red blazing fires.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree hundred winters mean three hundred periods or cycles. “Replenished,”\r\nmark well; that is to say, all this had been on it before; and thus is\r\nproven the knowledge of the doctrine about the successive Destructions of\r\nthe World and its Life‐Cycles. Once the “three hundred winters” were over,\r\nAhura Mazda warns Yima that the Earth is becoming too full, and men have\r\nnowhere to live. Then Yima steps forward, and with the help of Spenta\r\nÂrmaita, the female Genius, or Spirit of the Earth, makes that Earth\r\nstretch out and become larger by one‐third, after which “new flocks and\r\nherds and men” appear upon it. Ahura Mazda warns him again, and Yima makes\r\nthe Earth by the same magic power to become larger by two‐thirds. “Nine\r\nhundred winters” _pass_ away, and Yima has to perform the ceremony for the\r\n_third_ time. The whole of this is allegorical. The three processes of\r\nstretching the Earth, refer to the three successive Continents and Races\r\nissuing one after and from the other, as explained more fully elsewhere.\r\nAfter the _third_ time, Ahura Mazda warns Yima in an assembly of\r\n“celestial gods” and “excellent mortals” that upon the material world the\r\nfatal winters are going to fall, and all _life_ will perish. This is the\r\nold Mazdean symbolism for the “Flood,” and the coming cataclysm to\r\nAtlantis, which sweeps away every Race in its turn. Like Vaivasvata Manu\r\nand Noah, Yima makes a Vara—an Enclosure, an Ark—under the God’s\r\ndirection, and brings thither the seed of every living creature, animals\r\nand “Fires.”\r\n\r\nIt is of this “Earth” or new Continent that Zarathushtra became the law‐\r\ngiver and ruler. This was the Fourth Race in its beginning, after the men\r\nof the Third began to die out. Till then, as said above, there had been no\r\nregular death, but only a transformation, for _men had no personality_ as\r\nyet. They had Monads—“Breaths” of the One Breath, as impersonal as the\r\nsource from which they proceeded. They had bodies, or rather shadows of\r\nbodies, which were sinless, hence Karma‐less. Therefore, as there was no\r\nKâma Loka—least of all Nirvâna or even Devachan—for the “Souls” of men who\r\nhad no personal Egos, there could be no intermediate periods between the\r\nincarnations. Like the Phœnix, primordial man resurrected out of his old\r\ninto a new body. Each time, and with each new generation, he became more\r\nsolid, more physically perfect, agreeably with the evolutionary law, which\r\nis the Law of Nature. Death came with the complete physical organism, and\r\nwith it—moral decay.\r\n\r\nThis explanation shows one more old religion agreeing in its symbology\r\nwith the Universal Doctrine.\r\n\r\nElsewhere the oldest Persian traditions, the relics of Mazdeism of the\r\nstill older Magians, are given, and some of them explained. Mankind did\r\nnot issue from one solitary couple. Nor was there ever a first man—whether\r\nAdam or Yima—but a first mankind.\r\n\r\nIt may, or may not, be “mitigated polygenism.” Once that both Creation _ex\r\nnihilo_ (an absurdity) and a superhuman Creator or Creators (a fact) are\r\nmade away with by Science, polygenism presents no more difficulties or\r\ninconveniences—rather fewer from a scientific point of view—than\r\nmonogenism does.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it is as scientific as any other claim. For in his Introduction\r\nto Nott and Gliddon’s _Types of Mankind_, Agassiz declares his belief in\r\nan indefinite number of “primordial races of men created _separately_”;\r\nand remarks that, “whilst in every zoological province animals are of\r\n_different_ species, _man_, in spite of the diversity of his races, always\r\nforms _one and the same_ human being.”\r\n\r\nOccultism defines and limits the number of primordial races to seven,\r\nbecause of the seven “Progenitors,” or Prajâpatis, the evolvers of beings.\r\nThese are neither Gods, nor supernatural Beings, but advanced Spirits from\r\nanother and lower Planet, reborn on this Planet, and giving birth in their\r\nturn in the present Round to present Humanity. This doctrine is again\r\ncorroborated by one of its echoes—among the Gnostics. In their\r\nanthropology and genesis of man they taught that “a certain company of\r\n_seven_ Angels,” formed the first men, who were no better than senseless,\r\ngigantic, shadowy forms—“a mere wriggling worm” (!) writes Irenæus,(1465)\r\nwho takes, as usual, the metaphor for reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nD. The Septenary In The Exoteric Works.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may now examine other ancient scriptures and see whether they contain\r\nthe septenary classification, and, if so, to what degree.\r\n\r\nScattered about in thousands of other Sanskrit texts, some still unopened,\r\nothers yet unknown, as well as in all the _Purânas_, as much as, if not\r\nmuch more than, even in the Jewish _Bible_, the numbers seven and forty‐\r\nnine (7 × 7) play a most prominent part. In the _Purânas_ they are found\r\nfrom the seven Creations, in the first chapters, down to the seven Rays of\r\nthe Sun at the final Pralaya, which expand into seven Suns and absorb the\r\nmaterial of the whole Universe. Thus the _Matsya Purâna_ has:\r\n\r\n\r\n    For the sake of promulgating the Vedas, Vishnu, in the beginning\r\n    of a Kalpa, related to Manu the story of Narasimha and the events\r\n    of _seven_ Kalpas.(1466)\r\n\r\n\r\nThen again the same _Purâna_ shows that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In all the Manvantaras, classes of Rishis(1467) appear by seven\r\n    and _seven_, and having established a code of law and morality\r\n    depart to felicity.(1468)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rishis, however, represent many other things besides living sages.\r\n\r\nIn Dr. Muir’s translation of the _Atharva Veda_, we read:\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. Time carries (us) forward, a steed, with _seven_ rays, a\r\n    thousand eyes, undecaying, full of fecundity. On him intelligent\r\n    sages mount; his wheels are all the worlds.\r\n\r\n    2. Thus Time moves on _seven_ wheels; he has _seven_ naves;\r\n    immortality is his axle. He is at present _all these worlds_. Time\r\n    hastens onward the first God.\r\n\r\n    3. A full jar is contained in Time. We behold him existing in many\r\n    forms. He is all these worlds in the future. They call him “Time\r\n    in the highest Heaven.”(1469)\r\n\r\n\r\nNow add to this the following verse from the Esoteric Volumes:\r\n\r\n_Space and Time are one. Space and Time are nameless, for they are the\r\nincognizable That, which can be sensed only through its seven Rays—which\r\nare the seven Creations, the seven Worlds, the seven Laws, etc._\r\n\r\nRemembering that the _Purânas_ insist on the identity of Vishnu with Time\r\nand Space,(1470) and that even the Rabbinical symbol for God is Maqom,\r\n“Space,” it becomes clear why, for purposes of a manifesting Deity—Space,\r\nMatter, and Spirit—the one central Point became the Triangle and\r\nQuaternary—the perfect Cube—hence _seven_. Even the Pravaha Wind—the\r\nmystic and occult force that gives the impulse to, and regulates the\r\ncourse of the stars and planets—is septenary. The _Kûrma_ and _Linga\r\nPurânas_ enumerate seven principal winds of that name, which winds are the\r\nprinciples of Cosmic Space.(1471) They are intimately connected with\r\nDhruva(1472) (now Alpha), the Pole‐Star, which is connected in its turn\r\nwith the production of various phenomena through cosmic forces.\r\n\r\nThus, from the seven Creations, seven Rishis, Zones, Continents,\r\nPrinciples, etc., in the Âryan Scriptures, the number has passed through\r\nIndian, Egyptian, Chaldæan, Greek, Jewish, Roman, and finally Christian\r\nmystic thought, until it landed in, and remained indelibly impressed on,\r\nevery exoteric theology. The seven old books stolen out of Noah’s Ark by\r\nHam, and given to Cush, his son, and the seven Brazen Columns of Ham and\r\nCheiron, are a reflection and a remembrance of the seven primordial\r\nMysteries instituted according to the “seven secret Emanations,” the seven\r\nSounds, and seven Rays—the spiritual and sidereal models of the seven\r\nthousand times seven copies of them in later æons.\r\n\r\nThe mysterious number is once more prominent in the no less mysterious\r\nMaruts. The _Vâyu Purâna_ shows, and the _Harivamsha_ corroborates,\r\nconcerning the Maruts—the oldest as the most incomprehensible of all the\r\nsecondary or lower Gods in the _Rig Veda_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    That they are _born in every Manvantara [Round], seven times\r\n    seven_ (or forty‐nine); that, in each Manvantara, _four times\r\n    seven_ (or twenty‐eight) obtain emancipation, but their places are\r\n    _filled up by persons reborn in that character_.(1473)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the Maruts in their Esoteric meaning, and who _those persons_\r\n“reborn in that character”? In the _Rik_ and other _Vedas_, the Maruts are\r\nrepresented as the Storm Gods and the _friends and allies_ of Indra; they\r\nare the “Sons of Heaven and of Earth.” This led to an allegory that makes\r\nthem the children of Shiva, the great patron of the Yogîs:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Mahâ Yogî, the great _ascetic_, in whom is centred the highest\r\n    perfection of austere penance and abstract meditation, _by which\r\n    the most unlimited powers are attained, marvels and miracles are\r\n    worked, the highest spiritual knowledge is acquired, and union\r\n    with the great spirit of the universe is eventually gained_.(1474)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the _Rig Veda_ the name Shiva is unknown, but the corresponding God is\r\ncalled Rudra, a name used for Agni, the Fire‐God, the Maruts being called\r\ntherein his sons. In the _Râmâyana_ and the _Purânas_, their mother,\r\nDiti—the sister, or complement, and a form of Aditi—anxious to obtain a\r\nson who would destroy Indra, is told by Kashyapa, the Sage, that if, “with\r\nthoughts wholly pious and person entirely pure,” she carries the babe in\r\nher womb “for a hundred years,”(1475) she will have such a son. But Indra\r\nfoils her in the design. With his thunderbolt he _divides the embryo in\r\nher womb into seven portions_, and then divides every such portion _into\r\nseven pieces again_, which become the swift‐moving deities, the\r\nMaruts.(1476) These Deities are only another _aspect_, or a development,\r\nof the Kumâras, who are patronymically Rudras, like many others.(1477)\r\n\r\nDiti, being Aditi—unless the contrary is proven to us—Aditi, we say, or\r\nÂkâsha in her highest form, is the Egyptian _seven‐fold_ Heaven. Every\r\ntrue Occultist will understand what this means. Diti, we repeat, is the\r\nsixth principle of _metaphysical_ Nature, the Buddhi of Âkâsha. Diti, the\r\nMother of the Maruts, is one of her terrestrial forms, made to represent,\r\nat one and the same time, the Divine Soul in the ascetic, and the divine\r\naspirations of mystic Humanity toward deliverance from the webs of Mâyâ,\r\nand consequent final bliss. Indra is now degraded, because of the Kali\r\nYuga, when such aspirations are no more general but have become abnormal\r\nthrough a general spread of Ahamkâra, the feeling of Egotism, or “I‐am‐\r\nness” and ignorance; but in the beginning Indra was one of the greatest\r\nGods of the Hindû Pantheon, as the _Rig Veda_ shows. Surâdhipa the “chief\r\nof the gods,” has fallen down from Jishnu, the “Leader of the Celestial\r\nHost”—the Hindû St. Michael—to an opponent of asceticism, the enemy of\r\nevery holy aspiration. He is shown married to Aindrî (Indrânî), the\r\npersonification of Aindriyaka, the evolution of the element of senses,\r\nwhom he married “because of her _voluptuous attractions_”; after which he\r\nbegan sending celestial female demons to excite the passions of holy men,\r\nYogîs, and “to beguile them from the potent penances which he dreaded.”\r\nTherefore, Indra, now characterized as “the god of the firmament, the\r\npersonified atmosphere”—is in reality the cosmic principle Mahat, and the\r\nfifth human principle, Manas in its dual aspect—as connected with Buddhi,\r\nand as allowing itself to be dragged down by the Kâma principle, the body\r\nof passions and desires. This is demonstrated by Brahmâ telling the\r\nconquered God that his frequent defeats were due to Karma, and were a\r\npunishment for his licentiousness, and the seduction of various nymphs. It\r\nis in this latter character that he seeks, to save himself from\r\ndestruction, to destroy the coming “babe,” destined to conquer him—the\r\nbabe, of course, allegorizing the divine and steady will of the Yogî,\r\ndetermined to resist all such temptations, and thus destroy the passions\r\nwithin his earthly personality. Indra succeeds again, because flesh\r\nconquers spirit.(1478) He divides the “embryo” (of new _divine_ Adeptship,\r\nbegotten once more by the Ascetics of the Âryan Fifth Race) into _seven_\r\nportions (a reference not alone to the seven sub‐races of the new Root‐\r\nRace, in each of which there will be a Manu,(1479) but also to the seven\r\ndegrees of Adeptship), and then each portion into seven pieces—alluding to\r\nthe Manu‐Rishis of each Root‐Race, and even sub‐race.\r\n\r\nIt does not seem difficult to perceive what is meant by the Maruts\r\nobtaining “four times seven” emancipations in every Manvantara, and by\r\nthose persons who are _re‐born_ in that character, viz., of the Maruts in\r\ntheir Esoteric meaning, and who “fill up their places.” The Maruts\r\nrepresent (_a_) the passions that storm and rage within every Candidate’s\r\nbreast, when preparing for an ascetic life—this mystically; (_b_) the\r\nOccult potencies concealed in the manifold aspects of Âkâsha’s lower\r\nprinciples—her body, or Sthûla Sharîra, representing the terrestrial,\r\nlower atmosphere of every inhabited Globe—this mystically and sidereally;\r\n(_c_) actual conscious existences, beings of a cosmic and psychic nature.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Marut in Occult parlance is one of the names given to\r\nthose Egos of great Adepts who have passed away, and are known also as\r\nNirmânakâyas; of those Egos for whom—_since they are beyond\r\nillusion_—there is no Devachan, who, having either voluntarily renounced\r\nNirvâna for the good of mankind, or who not yet having reached it, remain\r\ninvisible on Earth. Therefore are the Maruts(1480) shown, firstly, as the\r\nsons of Shiva‐Rudra, the Patron Yogî, whose Third Eye (mystically) must be\r\nacquired by the Ascetic before he becomes an Adept; then, in their cosmic\r\ncharacter, as the subordinates of Indra and his opponents, under various\r\ncharacters. The “four times seven” emancipations have a reference to the\r\nfour Rounds, and the four Races that preceded ours, in each of which\r\nMaruta‐Jîvas (Monads) have been re‐born, and would have obtained final\r\nliberation, if only they had chosen to avail themselves of it. But instead\r\nof this, out of love for the good of mankind, which would struggle still\r\nmore hopelessly in the meshes of ignorance and misery _were it not for\r\nthis extraneous help_, they are re‐born over and over again “in that\r\ncharacter,” and thus “fill up their own places.” _Who_ they are, “on\r\nEarth”—every student of Occult Science knows. And he also knows that the\r\nMaruts are Rudras, among whom also the family of Tvashtri, a synonym of\r\nVishvakarman, the great Patron of the Initiates, is included. This gives\r\nus an ample knowledge of their true nature.\r\n\r\nThe same for the septenary division of cosmos and the human principles.\r\nThe _Purânas_, along with other sacred texts, teem with allusions to this.\r\nFirst of all, the Mundane Egg which contained Brahmâ, or the Universe, was\r\nexternally invested with _seven_ natural elements, at first loosely\r\nenumerated as Water, Air, Fire, Ether, and _three secret_ elements; then\r\nthe “World” is said to be “encompassed on every side” by seven elements,\r\nalso _within_ the Egg—as explained:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The world is encompassed on every side, and above, and below, by\r\n    the shell of the egg (of Brahmâ) [Andakatâha].(1481)\r\n\r\n\r\nAround the shell flows Water, which is surrounded with Fire; Fire by Air;\r\nAir by Ether; Ether by the Origin of the Elements (Ahamkâra); the latter\r\nby Universal Mind, or “Intellect,” as Wilson translates. It relates to\r\nSpheres of Being as much as to Principles. Prithivî is not our Earth but\r\nthe World, the Solar System, and means the “broad,” the “wide.” In the\r\n_Vedas_—the greatest of all authorities, though needing a key to be read\r\ncorrectly—three terrestrial and three celestial Earths are mentioned as\r\nhaving been called into existence simultaneously with Bhûmi, our Earth. We\r\nhave often been told that six, not _seven_, appears to be the number of\r\nspheres, principles, etc. We answer that there are, in fact, only six\r\nprinciples in man; since his body is _no_ principle, but the covering, the\r\nshell of a principle. So with the Planetary Chain; therein, speaking\r\nEsoterically, the Earth—as well as the seventh, or rather fourth plane,\r\none that stands as the seventh, if we count from the first triple kingdom\r\nof the Elementals that begin its formation—may be left out of\r\nconsideration, being (to us) the only distinct body of the seven. The\r\nlanguage of Occultism is varied. But supposing that _three_ Earths only,\r\ninstead of seven, are meant in the _Vedas_, what are those three, since we\r\nstill know of but one? Evidently there _must be_ an Occult meaning in the\r\nstatement under consideration. Let us see. The “Earth that floats” on the\r\nUniversal Ocean of Space, which Brahmâ divides in the _Purânas_ into seven\r\nZones, is Prithivî, the World divided into seven principles—a cosmic\r\ndivision, looking metaphysical enough, but, in reality, _physical_ in its\r\nOccult effects. Many Kalpas later, our Earth is mentioned, and again, in\r\nits turn, is divided into seven Zones according to the law of analogy\r\nwhich guided ancient Philosophers. After which we find on it seven\r\nContinents, seven Isles, seven Oceans, seven Seas and Rivers, seven\r\nMountains, seven Climates, etc.(1482)\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it is not only in the Hindû scriptures and philosophy that\r\none finds references to the seven Earths, but in the Persian, Phœnician,\r\nChaldæan, and Egyptian cosmogonies, and even in Rabbinical literature. The\r\nPhœnix(1483)—called by the Hebrews Onech ענק, from Phenoch, Enoch, the\r\nsymbol of a secret cycle and initiation, and by the Turks, Kerkes—lives a\r\nthousand years, after which, kindling a flame, it is self‐consumed; and\r\nthen, reborn from itself, it lives another thousand years, up to _seven\r\ntimes seven_,(1484) when comes the Day of Judgment. The “seven times\r\nseven,” or forty‐nine, are a transparent allegory, and an allusion to the\r\nforty‐nine Manus, the seven Rounds, and the seven times seven human Cycles\r\nin each Round on each Globe. The Kerkes and the Onech stand for a Race\r\nCycle, and the mystical Tree Ababel, the “Father Tree” in the _Kurân_,\r\nshoots out new branches and vegetation at every resurrection of the Kerkes\r\nor Phœnix; the “Day of Judgment” meaning a minor Pralaya. The author of\r\nthe _Book of God_ and the _Apocalypse_ believes that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Phœnix is ... very plainly the same as the Simorgh of Persian\r\n    romance; and the account which is given us of this last bird yet\r\n    more decisively establishes the opinion that the death and revival\r\n    of the Phœnix exhibit the successive destruction and reproduction\r\n    of the world, which many believed to be effected by the agency of\r\n    a fiery deluge [and also a watery one in its turn]. When the\r\n    Simorgh was asked her age, she informed Caherman that this world\r\n    is very ancient, for it has been already _seven times\r\n    replenished_, with beings different from men, and _seven times\r\n    depopulated_:(1485) that the age of the human race in which we now\r\n    are, is to endure seven thousand years, and that she herself had\r\n    seen _twelve_ of these revolutions, and knew not how many more she\r\n    had to see.(1486)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above, however, is no new statement. From Bailly, in the last century,\r\ndown to Dr. Kenealy, in the present, these facts have been noticed by a\r\nnumber of writers; but now a connection can be established between the\r\nPersian oracle and the Nazarene prophet. Says the author of the _Book of\r\nGod_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Simorgh is in reality the same as the winged Singh of the\r\n    Hindûs, and the Sphinx of the Egyptians. It is said that the\r\n    former will appear at the end of the world ... [as a] monstrous\r\n    lion‐bird.... From these the Rabbins have borrowed their mythos of\r\n    an enormous Bird, sometimes standing on the earth, sometimes\r\n    walking in the ocean ... while its head props the sky; and with\r\n    the symbol, they have also adopted the doctrine to which it\r\n    relates. They teach that there are to be _seven successive\r\n    renewals_ of the globe; that each reproduced system will last\r\n    _seven_ thousand years [?]; and that the _total duration of the\r\n    Universe_ will be 49,000 years. This opinion, which involves the\r\n    doctrine of the preëxistence of each renewed creature, they may\r\n    either have learned during their Babylonian captivity, or _it may\r\n    have been part of the primeval religion_ which their priests had\r\n    preserved from remote times.(1487)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt shows rather that the initiated Jews _borrowed_, and their non‐\r\ninitiated successors, the Talmudists, lost, the sense, and applied the\r\nseven Rounds, and the forty‐nine Races, etc., wrongly.\r\n\r\nNot only _their_ priests, but those of every other country. The Gnostics,\r\nwhose various teachings are the many echoes of the one primitive and\r\nuniversal doctrine, put the same numbers, under another form, in the mouth\r\nof Jesus in the very occult _Pistis Sophia_. We say more: even the\r\nChristian editor or author of _Revelation_ has preserved this tradition\r\nand speaks of the _seven_ Races, four of which, with part of the fifth,\r\nare gone, and two have to come. It is stated as plainly as can be. Thus\r\nsaith the angel:\r\n\r\n\r\n    And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven\r\n    mountains, on which the woman sitteth. And there are _seven_\r\n    kings; _five_ are fallen, and one _is_, and the other is not yet\r\n    come.(1488)\r\n\r\n\r\nWho, in the least acquainted with the symbolical language of old, will\r\nfail to discern in the _five_ Kings that have fallen, the four Root‐Races\r\nthat were, and part of the Fifth, the one that _is_; and in the _other_,\r\nthat “is not yet come,” the Sixth and Seventh coming Root‐Races, as also\r\nthe sub‐races of this, our present Race? Another still more forcible\r\nallusion to the seven Rounds and the forty‐nine Root‐Races in _Leviticus_,\r\nwill be found elsewhere, Part III.(1489)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nE. Seven In Astronomy, Science, And Magic.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, number _seven_ is closely connected with the Occult significance of\r\nthe Pleiades, those seven daughters of Atlas, “the six present, the\r\nseventh _hidden_.” In India they are connected with their nursling, the\r\nwar God, Kârttikeya. It was the Pleiades (in Sanskrit, Krittikâs) who gave\r\nthis name to the God, Kârttikeya being the planet Mars, _astronomically_.\r\nAs a God he is the son of Rudra, born without the intervention of a woman.\r\nHe is a Kumâra, a “virgin youth” again, generated in the fire from the\r\nSeed of Shiva—the Holy Spirit—hence called Agni‐bhû. The late Dr. Kenealy\r\nbelieved that, in India, Kârttikeya is the secret symbol of the Cycle of\r\nthe Naros, composed of 600, 666, and 777 years, according to whether solar\r\nor lunar, divine or mortal, years are counted; and that the six visible,\r\nor the seven actual sisters, the Pleiades, are needed for the completion\r\nof this most secret and mysterious of all the astronomical and religious\r\nsymbols. Therefore, when intended to commemorate one particular event,\r\nKârttikeya was shown, of old, as a Kumâra, an Ascetic, with _six_\r\nheads—one for each century of the Naros. When the symbolism was needed for\r\nanother event, then, in conjunction with the seven sidereal sisters,\r\nKârttikeya is seen accompanied by Kaumârî, or Senâ, his female aspect. He\r\nis then riding on a peacock, the bird of Wisdom and Occult Knowledge, and\r\nthe Hindû Phœnix, whose Greek relation with the 600 years of the Naros is\r\nwell known. A six‐rayed star (double triangle), a Svastika, a six and\r\noccasionally seven‐pointed crown, is on his brow; the peacock’s tail\r\nrepresents the sidereal heavens; and the twelve signs of the Zodiac are\r\n_hidden on his body_; for which he is also called Dvâdasha‐kara, the\r\n“twelve‐handed,” and Dvâdashâksha, “twelve‐eyed.” It is as Shakti‐dhara,\r\nhowever, the “spear‐holder,” and the conqueror of Târaka, Târaka‐jit, that\r\nhe is shown to be most famous.\r\n\r\nAs the years of the Naros are, in India, counted in two ways, either by\r\none hundred “years of the gods” (divine years), or one hundred “mortal\r\nyears,” we can see the tremendous difficulty the non‐initiated have in\r\narriving at a correct comprehension of this cycle, which plays such an\r\nimportant part in St. John’s _Revelation_. It is the truly apocalyptic\r\ncycle, because of its being of various lengths and relating to various\r\npre‐historic events, and in none of the numerous speculations about it\r\nhave we found any but a few _approximate_ truths.\r\n\r\nAgainst the duration claimed by the Babylonians for their divine ages, it\r\nhas been urged that Suidas shows the Ancients counting days for years, in\r\ntheir chronological computations. It is to Suidas and his authority that\r\nDr. Sepp appeals in his ingenious plagiarism—which we have already\r\nexposed—of the Hindû figures 432. These they give in thousands and\r\nmillions of years, the duration of their Yugas, but Sepp dwarfed them to\r\n4,320 _lunar_ years,(1490) “before the birth of Christ,” as “foreordained”\r\nin the sidereal, in addition to the invisible, heavens, and proved “by the\r\napparition of the Star of Bethlehem.” But Suidas had no other warrant for\r\nthis assertion than his own speculations, and he was not an Initiate. He\r\ncites, as a proof, Vulcan, and shows him reigning 4,477 years, or 4,477\r\n_days_, as he thinks, or again rendered in years, 12 years, 3 months, and\r\n7 days; he has, however, 5 days in his original—thus committing an error\r\neven in such an easy calculation.(1491) True, there are other ancient\r\nwriters guilty of like fallacious speculations; Calisthenes, for instance,\r\nwho assigns to the astronomical observations of the Chaldæans only 1,903\r\nyears, whereas Epigenes recognizes 720,000 years.(1492) The whole of these\r\nhypotheses made by profane writers are due to a misunderstanding. The\r\nchronology of the Western peoples, ancient Greeks and Romans, was borrowed\r\nfrom India. Now, it is said in the Tamil edition of _Bagavadam_ that 15\r\nsolar days make a Paccham; two Pacchams, or 30 days, make a month of\r\nmortals, which is only one _day_ of the Pitara Devatâ or Pitris. Again, 2\r\nof these months constitute a Rûdû, 3 Rûdûs make an Ayanam, and 2 Ayanams a\r\nyear of mortals, which is only a _day_ of the Gods. It is from such\r\nmisunderstood teachings that some Greeks have imagined that all the\r\ninitiated priests had transformed days into years!\r\n\r\nThis mistake of the ancient Greek and Latin writers became pregnant with\r\nresults in Europe. At the close of the past and the beginning of the\r\npresent century, Bailly, Dupuis, and others, relying upon the purposely\r\nmutilated accounts of Hindû chronology, brought from India by certain\r\nunscrupulous and too zealous missionaries, built quite a fantastic theory\r\non the subject. Because the Hindûs had made of half a revolution of the\r\nmoon a measure of time; and because a month composed of only fifteen days,\r\nof which Quintus Curtius speaks,(1493) is found mentioned in Hindû\r\nliterature, therefore, it becomes a verified fact that their _year_ was\r\nonly half a year, when it was not called a _day_! The Chinese, also,\r\ndivided their Zodiac into twenty‐four parts, and hence their year into\r\ntwenty‐four fortnights, but such computation did not, nor does it, prevent\r\nthem having an astronomical year just the same as ours. They also have a\r\nperiod of 60 days—the Southern Indian Rûdû—to this day in some provinces.\r\nMoreover, Diodorus Siculus(1494) calls “_thirty days_ an Egyptian year,”\r\nor that period during which the moon performs a complete revolution. Pliny\r\nand Plutarch(1495) both speak of it; but does it stand to reason that the\r\nEgyptians, who knew Astronomy as well as any other nation, made the\r\n_lunar_ month consist of 30 days, when it is only 28 days with fractions?\r\nThis lunar period had an Occult meaning surely as well as had also the\r\nAyanam and the Rûdû of the Hindûs. The year of 2 months’ duration, and the\r\nperiod of 60 days also, was a universal measure of time in antiquity, as\r\nBailly himself shows in his _Traité de l’ Astronomie Indienne et\r\nOrientale_. The Chinamen, according to their own books, divided their year\r\ninto two parts, from one equinox to the other;(1496) the Arabs anciently\r\ndivided the year into six seasons, each composed of two months; in the\r\nChinese astronomical work called _Kioo‐tche_, it is said that two moons\r\nmake a measure of time, and six measures a year; and to this day the\r\naborigines of Kamschatka have their years of six months, as they had when\r\nvisited by Abbé Chappe.(1497) But is all this any reason for claiming that\r\nwhen the Hindû _Purânas_ say a solar _year_, they mean one solar _day_!\r\n\r\nIt was the knowledge of the natural laws which make of seven the root\r\nnature‐number, so to say, in the manifested world, or at any rate in our\r\npresent terrestrial life‐cycle, and the wonderful comprehension of its\r\nworkings, that unveiled to the Ancients so many of the mysteries of\r\nNature. It is these laws, again, and their processes on the sidereal,\r\nterrestrial, and moral planes, which enabled the old Astronomers to\r\ncalculate correctly the duration of the cycles and their respective\r\neffects on the march of events; to record beforehand—to prophesy, it is\r\ncalled—the influence which they would have on the course and development\r\nof the human races. The Sun, Moon, and Planets being the never‐erring\r\ntime‐measurers, whose potency and periodicity were well known, became thus\r\nrespectively the great ruler and rulers of our little system in all its\r\nseven domains, or “spheres of action.”(1498)\r\n\r\nThis has been so evident and remarkable, that even many of the modern men\r\nof Science, Materialists as well as Mystics, have had their attention\r\ncalled to this law. Physicians and Theologians, Mathematicians and\r\nPsychologists, have repeatedly drawn the attention of the world to this\r\nfact of periodicity in the behaviour of “Nature.” These numbers are\r\nexplained in the Commentaries in the following words:\r\n\r\n_The Circle is not the __“__One__”__ but the __“__All.__”_\r\n\r\n_In the higher [Heaven], the impenetrable Rajah,_(_1499_)_ it [the Circle]\r\nbecomes One, because [it is] the indivisible, and there can be no Tau in\r\nit._\r\n\r\n_In the second [of the three Rajamsi, or the three __“__Worlds__”__], the\r\nOne becomes Two [male and female], and Three [with the Son or Logos], and\r\nthe Sacred Four [the Tetraktys, or Tetragrammaton]._\r\n\r\n_In the third [the lower World or our Earth], the number becomes Four, and\r\nThree, and Two. Take the first two, and thou wilt obtain Seven, the sacred\r\nnumber of life; blend [the latter] with the middle Rajah, and thou wilt\r\nhave Nine, the sacred number of Being and Becoming._(1500)\r\n\r\nWhen the Western Orientalists have mastered the real meaning of the Rig\r\nVedic divisions of the World—the two‐fold, three‐fold, six‐ and seven‐\r\nfold, and especially the nine‐fold division—the mystery of the cyclic\r\ndivisions applied to Heaven and Earth, Gods and Men, will become clearer\r\nto them than it is now. For:\r\n\r\n\r\n    _There is a harmony of numbers in all nature; in the force of\r\n    gravity, in the planetary movements, in the laws of heat, light,\r\n    electricity, and chemical affinity, in the forms of animals and\r\n    plants, in the perceptions of the mind._ The direction, indeed, of\r\n    modern natural and physical science is towards a generalization\r\n    which shall express the fundamental laws of all, by one simple\r\n    numerical ratio. We would refer to Professor Whewell’s _Philosophy\r\n    of the Inductive Sciences_, and to Mr. Hay’s researches into the\r\n    laws of harmonious colouring and form. _From these it appears that\r\n    the number seven is distinguished in the laws regulating the\r\n    harmonious perception of forms, colours, and sounds_, and probably\r\n    of taste also, if we could analyze our sensations of this kind\r\n    with mathematical accuracy.(1501)\r\n\r\n\r\nSo much so, indeed, that more than one Physician has stood aghast at the\r\n_septenary_ periodical return of the cycles in the rise and fall of\r\nvarious complaints, and Naturalists have felt themselves at an utter loss\r\nto explain this law.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The birth, growth, maturity, vital functions, healthy revolutions\r\n    of change, diseases, decay and death, of insects, reptiles,\r\n    fishes, birds, mammals, and even of man, are more or less\r\n    controlled by a law of _completion in weeks_ [or seven\r\n    days].(1502)\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Laycock, writing on the “Periodicity of  Vital Phenomena,”(1503)\r\nrecords a “most remarkable illustration and confirmation of the law in\r\ninsects.”(1504)\r\n\r\nTo all of which Mr. Grattan Guinness remarks very pertinently, as he\r\ndefends biblical chronology:\r\n\r\n\r\n    And man’s life ... is a _week_, a _week of decades_. “The days of\r\n    our years are three‐score years and ten.” Combining the testimony\r\n    of all these facts, we are bound to admit that _there prevails in\r\n    organic nature a law of septiform periodicity, a law of completion\r\n    in weeks_.(1505)\r\n\r\n\r\nWithout accepting the conclusions, and especially the premises of the\r\nlearned founder of “The East London Institute for Home and Foreign\r\nMissions,” the writer accepts and welcomes his researches in the Occult\r\nchronology of the _Bible_; just as, while rejecting the theories,\r\nhypotheses, and generalizations of Modern Science, we bow before its great\r\nachievements in the world of the Physical, or in all the minor details of\r\nmaterial Nature.\r\n\r\nThere is most assuredly an Occult “chronological system in Hebrew\r\nscripture,” the _Kabalah_ being its warrant; moreover there is in it “a\r\nsystem of weeks,” based on the archaic Indian system, which may still be\r\nfound in the old Jyotisha.(1506) And there are in it cycles of the “_week_\r\nof days,” of the “_week_ of months,” of years, of centuries, and even of\r\nmillenniums, and more, of the “week of years of years.”(1507) But all this\r\ncan be found in the Archaic Doctrine. And if the common source of the\r\nchronology in every scripture, however _veiled_, is denied in the case of\r\nthe _Bible_; then it will have to be shown how, in face of the six days\r\nand the seventh (a Sabbath), we can escape connecting the Genetic with the\r\nPaurânic Cosmogonies. For the first “week of creation” shows the\r\nseptiformity of its chronology and thus connects it with Brahmâ’s “seven\r\ncreations.” The able volume from the pen of Mr. Grattan Guinness, in which\r\nhe has collected in some 760 pages every proof of this septiform\r\ncalculation, is good evidence. For if the biblical chronology is, as he\r\nsays, “regulated by the law of weeks,” and if it is septenary, whatever\r\nthe measures of the creation week and the length of its days may be, and\r\nif, finally, “the Bible system includes weeks on a great variety of\r\nscales,” then this system is shown to be identical with all the Pagan\r\nsystems. Moreover, the attempt to show that 4,320 years, in lunar months,\r\nelapsed between the “Creation” and the “Nativity,” is a clear and\r\nunmistakable connection with the 4,320,000 years of the Hindû Yugas.\r\nOtherwise, why make such efforts to prove that these figures, which are\r\npreëminently Chaldæan and Indo‐Âryan, play such a part in the _New\r\nTestament_? This we shall now prove still more forcibly.\r\n\r\nLet the impartial critic compare the two accounts—the _Vishnu Purâna_ and\r\nthe _Bible_—and he will find that the “seven creations” of Brahmâ are at\r\nthe foundation of the “week of creation” in _Genesis_. The two allegories\r\nare different, but the systems are both built on the same foundation‐\r\nstone. The _Bible_ can be understood _only by the light of_ the _Kabalah_.\r\nTake the _Zohar_, the “Book of Concealed Mystery,” however now disfigured,\r\nand compare. The seven Rishis and the fourteen Manus, of the seven\r\nManvantaras, issue from Brahmâ’s head; they are his “Mind‐born Sons,” and\r\nit is with them that begins the division of mankind into its Races from\r\nthe Heavenly Man, the manifested Logos, who is Brahmâ Prajâpati. Speaking\r\nof the “Skull” (Head) of Macroprosopus, the Ancient One(1508) (in Sanskrit\r\nSanat is an appellation of Brahmâ), the _Ha Idra Rabba Qadisha_, or\r\n“Greater Holy Assembly,” says that in every one of his hairs is a hidden\r\nfountain issuing from the concealed brain.\r\n\r\n\r\n    And it shineth and goeth forth through that hair unto the hair of\r\n    Microprosopus, and from it [which is the manifest Quaternary, the\r\n    Tetragrammaton] is his brain formed; and thence that brain goeth\r\n    forth into _thirty_ and _two_ paths [or the Triad and the Duad, or\r\n    again 432].\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Thirteen curls of hair exist on the one side and on the other of\r\n    the skull [_i.e._, six on one and six on the other, the thirteenth\r\n    being also the fourteenth, as it is male‐female]; ... and through\r\n    them commenceth the division of the hair [the division of things,\r\n    of mankind and the races].(1509)\r\n\r\n\r\n“We _six_ are lights which shine forth from a _seventh_ (light),” saith\r\nRabbi Abba; “_thou art the seventh light_”—the synthesis of us all—he\r\nadds, speaking of Tetragrammaton and his seven “companions,” whom he calls\r\nthe “eyes of Tetragrammaton.”(1510)\r\n\r\nTetragrammaton is Brahmâ Prajâpati, who assumed _four_ forms, in order to\r\ncreate four kinds of _supernal_ creatures, _i.e._, made himself _four‐\r\nfold_, or the manifest Quaternary;(1511) after that, he is re‐born in the\r\n_seven_ Rishis, his Mânasaputras, “Mind‐born Sons,” who became later,\r\nnine, twenty‐one, and so on, and who are all said to be born from various\r\nparts of Brahmâ.(1512)\r\n\r\nThere are two Tetragrammatons: the Macroprosopus and the Microprosopus.\r\nThe first is the absolute perfect Square, or the Tetraktys within the\r\nCircle, both abstract conceptions, and is therefore called Ain—Non‐being,\r\n_i.e._, illimitable or absolute “Be‐ness.” But when viewed as\r\nMicroprosopus, or the Heavenly Man, the Manifested Logos, he is the\r\nTriangle in the Square—the _sevenfold_ Cube, not the fourfold, or the\r\nplane Square. For it is written in “The Greater Holy Assembly”:\r\n\r\n\r\n    And concerning this, the children of Israel wished to inquire in\r\n    their hearts [know in their minds], like as it is written, Exod.\r\n    xvii. 7: “Is the Tetragrammaton in the midst of us, or the\r\n    Negatively Existent One?”(1513)\r\n\r\n\r\n—where they distinguished between Microprosopus, who is called\r\nTetragrammaton, and between Macroprosopus, who is called Ain, the\r\nNegatively Existent.(1514)\r\n\r\nTherefore, Tetragrammaton is the Three _made_ four and the Four made\r\nthree, and is represented on this Earth by his seven “Companions,” or\r\n“Eyes”—the “seven eyes of the Lord.” Microprosopus is, at best, only a\r\n_secondary_ manifested Deity. For “The Greater Holy Assembly” elsewhere\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We have learned that there _were ten_ (_Rabbis_) [Companions]\r\n    entered into (_the Assembly_) [the Sod, “mysterious assembly or\r\n    mystery”] and that _seven_ came forth(1515) [_i.e._, _ten_ for the\r\n    unmanifested, seven for the manifested Universe].\r\n\r\n    1158. And when Rabbi Schimeon revealed the Arcana, there were\r\n    found none present there save those [seven] (_companions_). And\r\n    Rabbi Schimeon called them the seven eyes of Tetragrammaton, like\r\n    as it is written, Zach. iii. 9: “These are the seven eyes [or\r\n    principles] of Tetragrammaton” [—_i.e._, the four‐fold Heavenly\r\n    Man, or pure Spirit, is resolved into septenary man, pure Matter\r\n    and Spirit].(1516)\r\n\r\n\r\nThus the Tetrad is Microprosopus, and the latter is the male‐female\r\nChokmah‐Binah, the second and third Sephiroth. The Tetragrammaton is the\r\nvery essence of number _seven_, in its terrestrial significance. Seven\r\nstands between four and nine—the basis and foundation, astrally, of our\r\nphysical world and man, in the kingdom of Malkuth.\r\n\r\nFor Christians and believers, this reference to _Zechariah_ and especially\r\nto the _Epistle of Peter_,(1517) ought to be conclusive. In the old\r\nsymbolism, “man,” chiefly the Inner Spiritual Man is called a “stone.”\r\nChrist is the corner‐stone, and Peter refers to all men as “lively”\r\n(living) stones. Therefore a “stone with seven eyes” on it can only mean a\r\nman whose constitution (_i.e._, his “principles”) is septenary.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate more clearly the seven in Nature, it may be added that not\r\nonly does the number seven govern the periodicity of the phenomena of\r\nlife, but that it is also found dominating the series of chemical\r\nelements, and equally paramount in the world of sound and in that of\r\ncolour as revealed to us by the spectroscope. This number is the factor,\r\n_sine quâ non_, in the production of occult astral phenomena.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to refer in detail to the number of vibrations constituting\r\nthe notes of the musical scale; they are strictly analogous to the scale\r\nof chemical elements, and also to the scale of colour as unfolded by the\r\nspectroscope, although in the latter case we deal with only _one_ octave,\r\nwhile both in music and chemistry we find a series of _seven_ octaves\r\nrepresented theoretically, of which _six_ are fairly complete and in\r\nordinary use in both sciences. Thus, to quote Hellenbach:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It has been established that, from the standpoint of phenomenal\r\n    law, upon which all our knowledge rests, the vibrations of sound\r\n    and light increase regularly, that they divide themselves into\r\n    _seven_ columns, and that the successive numbers in each column\r\n    are closely allied; _i.e._, that they exhibit a close relationship\r\n    which not only is expressed in the figures themselves, but also is\r\n    practically confirmed in chemistry as in music, in the latter of\r\n    which the ear confirms the verdict of the figures.... The fact\r\n    that this periodicity and variety is governed by the number\r\n    _seven_ is undeniable, and it far surpasses the limits of mere\r\n    chance, and must be assumed to have an adequate cause, which cause\r\n    must be discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\nVerily, then, as Rabbi Abba said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We are six lights which shine forth from a seventh (_light_); thou\r\n    [Tetragrammaton] art the seventh light (_the origin of_) us all.\r\n\r\n    For assuredly there is no stability in those six, save (_what they\r\n    derive_) from the seventh. For all things depend from the\r\n    seventh.(1518)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ancient and modern Western American Zuñi Indians seem to have\r\nentertained similar views. Their present‐day customs, their traditions and\r\nrecords, all point to the fact that, from time immemorial, their\r\ninstitutions, political, social and religious, were, and still are, shaped\r\naccording to the septenary principle. Thus all their ancient towns and\r\nvillages were built in clusters of six, around a seventh. It is always a\r\ngroup of seven, or of thirteen, and always the six surround the seventh.\r\nAgain, their sacerdotal hierarchy is composed of six “Priests of the\r\nHouse” seemingly synthesized in the seventh, who is a woman, the\r\n“Priestess Mother.” Compare this with the “seven great officiating\r\npriests” spoken of in the _Anugîtâ_, the name given to the “seven senses,”\r\nexoterically, and to the seven human principles, Esoterically. Whence this\r\nidentity of symbolism? Shall we still doubt the fact of Arjuna going over\r\nto Pâtâla, the Antipodes, America, and there marrying Ulûpî, the daughter\r\nof the Nâga, or rather Nargal, king? But to the Zuñi priests.\r\n\r\nThese receive, to this day, an annual tribute of corn of seven colours.\r\nUndistinguished from other Indians during the rest of the year, on a\r\ncertain day they come out—six priests and one priestess—arrayed in their\r\npriestly robes, each of a colour sacred to the particular God whom the\r\npriest serves and personifies; each of them representing one of the seven\r\nregions, and each receiving corn of the colour corresponding to that\r\nregion. Thus, the white represents the East, because from the East comes\r\nthe first sun‐light; the yellow corresponds to the North, from the colour\r\nof the flames produced by the Aurora Borealis; the red, the South, as from\r\nthat quarter comes the heat; the blue stands for the West, the colour of\r\nthe Pacific Ocean, which lies to the West; black is the colour of the\r\nnether underground region—darkness; corn with grains of all colours on one\r\near represents the colours of the upper region—of the firmament, with its\r\nrosy and yellow clouds, shining stars, etc. The “speckled” corn, each\r\ngrain containing all the colours, is that of the “Priestess‐Mother”—woman\r\ncontaining in herself the seeds of all races past, present and future; Eve\r\nbeing the mother of all living.\r\n\r\nApart from these was the Sun—the Great Deity—whose priest was the\r\nspiritual head of the nation. These facts were ascertained by Mr. F.\r\nHamilton Cushing, who, as many are aware, became a Zuñi, lived with them,\r\nwas initiated into their religious mysteries, and has learned more about\r\nthem than any other man now living.\r\n\r\nSeven is also the great magic number. In the Occult Records the weapon\r\nmentioned in the _Purânas_ and the _Mahâbhârata_—the Âgneyâstra or “fiery\r\nweapon” bestowed by Aurva upon his Chelâ Sagara—is said to be constructed\r\nof seven elements. This weapon—supposed by some ingenious Orientalists to\r\nhave been a “rocket” (!)—is one of the many thorns in the side of our\r\nmodern Sanskritists. Wilson exercises his penetration over it, on several\r\npages in his _Specimens of the Hindû Theatre_, and finally fails to\r\nexplain it. He can make nothing out of the Âgneyâstra, for he argues:\r\n\r\n\r\n    These weapons are of a very unintelligible character. Some of them\r\n    are occasionally wielded as missiles; but, in general, they\r\n    _appear to be mystical powers exercised by the individual_—such as\r\n    those of paralyzing an enemy, or _locking his senses fast in\r\n    sleep_, or bringing down storm, and rain, and fire, from\r\n    heaven.(1519)... They are supposed to assume celestial shapes,\r\n    endowed with human faculties.... The _Râmâyana_ calls them the\r\n    sons of Krishâshva.(1520)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Shastra‐devatâs, “Gods of the divine weapons,” are no more\r\nÂgneyâstras, the weapons, than the gunners of modern artillery are the\r\ncannon they direct. But this simple solution did not seem to strike the\r\neminent Sanskritist. Nevertheless, as he himself says of the armiform\r\nprogeny of Krishâshva, “the allegorical origin of the Âgneyâstra weapons\r\nis, undoubtedly, the more ancient.”(1521) It is the fiery javelin of\r\nBrahmâ.\r\n\r\nThe seven‐fold Âgneyâstra, like the seven senses and the seven principles,\r\nsymbolized by the seven priests, are of untold antiquity. How old is the\r\ndoctrine believed in by Theosophists, the following Section will tell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nF. The Seven Souls Of The Egyptologists.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf one turns to those wells of information, _The Natural Genesis_ and the\r\n_Lectures_ of Mr. Gerald Massey, the proofs of the antiquity of the\r\ndoctrine under analysis become positively overwhelming. That the belief of\r\nthe author differs from ours can hardly invalidate the facts. He views the\r\nsymbol from a purely natural standpoint, one perhaps a trifle too\r\nmaterialistic, because too much that of an ardent Evolutionist and\r\nfollower of the modern Darwinian dogmas. Thus he shows that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The student of Böhme’s books finds much in them concerning these\r\n    Seven “Fountain Spirits,” and primary powers, treated as seven\r\n    properties of Nature in the alchemistic and astrological phase of\r\n    the mediæval mysteries....\r\n\r\n    The followers of Böhme look on such matter as the divine\r\n    revelation of his inspired Seership. They know nothing of the\r\n    natural genesis, the history and persistence of the “Wisdom”(1522)\r\n    of the past (or of the broken links), and are unable to recognize\r\n    the physical features of the ancient “Seven Spirits” beneath their\r\n    modern metaphysical or alchemist mask. A second connecting link\r\n    between the theosophy of Böhme and the physical origins of\r\n    Egyptian thought, is extant in the fragments of _Hermes\r\n    Trismegistus_.(1523) No matter whether these teachings are called\r\n    Illuminatist, Buddhist, Kabalist, Gnostic, Masonic, or Christian,\r\n    the elemental types can only be truly known in their\r\n    beginnings.(1524) When the prophets or visionary showmen of\r\n    cloudland come to us claiming original inspiration, and utter\r\n    something new, we judge of its value by what it is in itself. But\r\n    if we find they bring us the ancient matter which they cannot\r\n    account for, and we can, it is natural that we should judge it by\r\n    the primary significations rather than the latest\r\n    pretensions.(1525) It is useless for us to read our later thought\r\n    into the earliest types of expression, and then say the ancients\r\n    meant that!(1526) Subtilized interpretations which have become\r\n    doctrines and dogmas in theosophy have now to be tested by their\r\n    genesis in physical phenomena, in order that we may explode their\r\n    false pretensions to supernatural origin or supernatural\r\n    knowledge.(1527)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the able author of _The Book of the Beginnings_ and of _The Natural\r\nGenesis_ does—very fortunately, for us—quite the reverse. He demonstrates\r\nmost triumphantly our Esoteric (Buddhist) teachings, by showing them\r\nidentical with those of Egypt. Let the reader judge from his learned\r\nlecture on “The Seven Souls of Man.”(1528) Says the author:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The first form of the mystical Seven was seen to be figured in\r\n    heaven by the seven large stars of the _Great Bear_, the\r\n    constellation assigned by the Egyptians to the Mother of Time, and\r\n    of the seven Elemental Powers.(1529)\r\n\r\n\r\nJust so, for the Hindûs place their seven primitive Rishis in the Great\r\nBear, and call this constellation the abode of the Saptarshi, Riksha and\r\nChitra‐shikhandinas. And their Adepts claim to know whether it is only an\r\nastronomical myth, or a primordial mystery having a deeper meaning than it\r\nbears on its surface. We are also told that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Egyptians divided the face of the sky by night into seven\r\n    parts. The primary Heaven was sevenfold.(1530)\r\n\r\n\r\nSo it was with the Âryans. One has but to read the _Purânas_ about the\r\nbeginnings of Brahmâ and his Egg, to see this. Have the Âryans then, taken\r\nthe idea from the Egyptians? But, as the lecturer proceeds:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The earliest forces recognized in Nature were reckoned as seven in\r\n    number. These became Seven Elementals, devils [?], or later\r\n    divinities. Seven properties were assigned to Nature—as matter,\r\n    cohesion, fluxion, coagulation, accumulation, station, and\r\n    division—and _seven elements or souls to man_.(1531)\r\n\r\n\r\nAll this was taught in the Esoteric Doctrine, but it was interpreted and\r\nits mysteries unlocked, as already stated, with _seven_, not two or, at\r\nthe utmost, three keys; hence the causes and their effects worked in\r\ninvisible or mystic as well as in psychic Nature, and were made referable\r\nto Metaphysics and Psychology as much as to Physiology. As the author\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\r\n    A principle of _sevening_, so to say, was introduced, and the\r\n    number seven supplied a sacred type _that could be used for\r\n    manifold purposes_.(1532)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd it was so used. For:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The seven souls of the Pharaoh are often mentioned in the Egyptian\r\n    texts.... _Seven souls, or principles in man were identified by\r\n    our British Druids_.... The Rabbins also ran the number of souls\r\n    up to seven: so, likewise, do the Karens of India.(1533)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then, the author, with several misspellings, tabulates the two\r\nteachings—the Esoteric and the Egyptian—and shows that the latter had the\r\nsame series and in the same order.\r\n\r\n[Esoteric] Indian.               Egyptian.\r\n1. Rûpa, body or element of      1. Kha, body.\r\nform.\r\n2. Prâna, the breath of life.    2. Ba, the soul of breath.\r\n3. Astral body.                  3. Khaba, the shade.\r\n4. Manas, or                     4. Akhu, intelligence or\r\nintelligence.(1534)              perception.\r\n5. Kâma Rûpa, or animal soul.    5. Seb, ancestral soul.\r\n6. Buddhi, or spiritual soul.    6. Putah, the first\r\n                                 intellectual father.\r\n7. Âtmâ, pure spirit.            7. Atmu, a divine, or eternal\r\n                                 soul.(1535)\r\n\r\nFurther on, the lecturer formulates these seven (Egyptian) Souls, as (1)\r\nThe Soul of Blood—the _formative_; (2) The Soul of Breath—that _breathes_;\r\n(3) The Shade or Covering Soul—that _envelopes_; (4) The Soul of\r\nPerception—that _perceives_; (5) The Soul of Pubescence—that _procreates_;\r\n(6) The Intellectual Soul—that _reproduces intellectually_; and (7) The\r\nSpiritual Soul—that is _perpetuated permanently_.\r\n\r\nFrom the exoteric and physiological standpoint this may be very correct;\r\nit becomes less so from the Esoteric point of view. To maintain this, does\r\nnot at all mean that the “Esoteric Buddhists” _resolve men into a number\r\nof elementary spirits_, as Mr. G. Massey, in the same lecture, accuses\r\nthem of maintaining. No “Esoteric Buddhist” has ever been guilty of any\r\nsuch absurdity. Nor has it been ever imagined that these shadows “become\r\nspiritual beings in another world,” or “seven potential spirits or\r\nelementaries of another life.” What is maintained is simply that every\r\ntime the immortal Ego incarnates it becomes, as a total, a compound unit\r\nof Matter and Spirit, which together act on seven different planes of\r\nbeing and consciousness. Elsewhere, Mr. Gerald Massey adds:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The seven souls [our “principles”] ... are often mentioned in the\r\n    Egyptian texts. The moon‐god, Taht‐Esmun, or the later sun‐god,\r\n    expressed the seven nature‐powers that were prior to himself, and\r\n    were summed up in him as his seven souls [we say “principles”]....\r\n    The seven stars in the hand of the Christ in Revelation, have the\r\n    same significance.(1536)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd a still greater one, as these stars represent also the _seven keys_ of\r\nthe Seven Churches or the Sodalian Mysteries, kabalistically. However, we\r\nwill not stop to discuss, but add that other Egyptologists have also\r\ndiscovered that the septenary constitution of man was a cardinal doctrine\r\nwith the old Egyptians. In a series of remarkable articles in the\r\n_Sphinx_, of Munich, Herr Franz Lambert gives incontrovertible proof of\r\nhis conclusions from the _Book of the Dead_ and other Egyptian records.\r\nFor details the reader must be referred to the articles themselves.\r\n\r\nBöhme, the prince of all the mediæval seers, says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We find seven especial properties in nature whereby this only\r\n    Mother works all things [which he calls fire, light, sound (the\r\n    upper three) and _desire_, _bitterness_, _anguish_, and\r\n    _substantiality_, thus analyzing the lower in his own mystic way];\r\n    whatever the six forms are spiritually, that the seventh [the body\r\n    or substantiality], is essentially. These are the seven forms of\r\n    the Mother of all Beings, from whence all that is in this world is\r\n    generated.(1537)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Creator hath, in the body of this world, generated himself as\r\n    it were _creaturely_ in his qualifying or Fountain Spirits, and\r\n    all the stars are ... God’s powers, and the whole body of the\r\n    world consisteth in the seven qualifying or fountain\r\n    spirits.(1538)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is rendering in mystical language our theosophical doctrine. But how\r\ncan we agree with Mr. Gerald Massey when he states that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Seven Races of Men that have been sublimated and made\r\n    Planetary [?] by Esoteric Buddhism,(1539) may be met with in the\r\n    Bundahish as (1) the earth‐men; (2) water‐men; (3) breast‐eared\r\n    men; (4) breast‐eyed men; (5) one‐legged men; (6) bat‐winged men;\r\n    (7) men with tails.(1540)\r\n\r\n\r\nEach of these descriptions, allegorical and even perverted in their later\r\nform, is, nevertheless, an echo of the Secret Doctrine teaching. They all\r\nrefer to the pre‐human evolution of the “Water‐men terrible and bad” by\r\n_unaided_ Nature through millions of years, as previously described. But\r\nwe deny point‐blank the assertion that “these were never real races,” and\r\npoint to the Archaic Stanzas for our answer. It is easy to infer and to\r\nsay that our “instructors have mistaken these shadows of the Past, for\r\nthings human and spiritual”; but that “they are neither, and never were\r\neither,” it is less easy to prove. The assertion must ever remain on a par\r\nwith the Darwinian claim that man and the ape had a common pithecoid\r\nancestor. What the lecturer takes for a “mode of expression” and nothing\r\nmore, in the Egyptian _Ritual_, we take as having quite another and an\r\nimportant meaning. Here is one instance. Says the _Ritual_, the _Book of\r\nthe Dead_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “I am the mouse.” “I am the hawk.” “I am the ape.”... “_I am the\r\n    crocodile whose soul comes from_ MEN.”... “_I am the soul of the\r\n    gods._”(1541)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last sentence but one is explained by the lecturer, who says\r\nparenthetically, “_that is, as a type of intelligence_,” and the last as\r\nmeaning, “the Horus, or Christ, as the outcome of all.”\r\n\r\nThe Occult Teaching answers: It means far more.\r\n\r\nIt gives first of all a corroboration of the teaching that, while the\r\nhuman Monad has passed on Globe A and others, in the First Round, through\r\nall the three kingdoms—the mineral, the vegetable, and the animal—in this\r\nour Fourth Round, every mammal has sprung from Man, if the semi‐ethereal,\r\nmany‐shaped creature with the _human_ Monad in it, of the first two Races,\r\ncan be regarded as Man. But it must be so called; for, in the Esoteric\r\nlanguage, it is not the form of flesh, blood, and bones, now referred to\r\nas man, which is in any way the Man, but the inner divine Monad with its\r\nmanifold principles or aspects.\r\n\r\nThe lecture referred to, however, much as it opposes _Esoteric Buddhism_\r\nand its teachings, is an eloquent answer to those who have tried to\r\nrepresent the whole as a new‐fangled doctrine. And there are many such, in\r\nEurope, America, and even India. Yet, between the Esotericism of the old\r\nArhats, and that which has now survived in India among the few Brâhmans\r\nwho have seriously studied their Secret Philosophy, the difference does\r\nnot appear so very great. It seems centred in, and limited to, the\r\nquestion of the order of the evolution of cosmic and other principles,\r\nmore than anything else. At all events it is no greater divergence than\r\nthe everlasting question of the _filioque_ dogma, which since the eighth\r\ncentury has separated the Roman Catholic from the older Greek Eastern\r\nChurch. Yet, whatever the differences in the forms in which the septenary\r\ndogma is presented, the substance is there, and its presence and\r\nimportance in the Brâhmanical system may be judged by what one of India’s\r\nlearned meta‐physicians and Vedântic scholars says of it:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The real esoteric seven‐fold classification is one of the most\r\n    important, if not the most important classification, which has\r\n    received its arrangement from the mysterious constitution of this\r\n    eternal type. I may also mention in this connection that the four‐\r\n    fold classification claims the same origin. The light of life, as\r\n    it were, seems to be refracted by the treble‐faced prism of\r\n    Prakriti, having the three Gunams for its three faces, and divided\r\n    into seven rays, which develop in course of time the seven\r\n    principles of this classification. The progress of development\r\n    presents some points of similarity to the gradual development of\r\n    the rays of the spectrum. While the four‐fold classification is\r\n    amply sufficient for all practical purposes, this real seven‐fold\r\n    classification is of great theoretical and scientific importance.\r\n    It will be necessary to adopt it to explain certain classes of\r\n    phenomena noticed by occultists; and it is perhaps better fitted\r\n    to be the basis of a perfect system of psychology. It is not the\r\n    peculiar property of the “Trans‐Himâlayan Esoteric Doctrine.” In\r\n    fact, it has a closer connection with the Brâhmanical Logos than\r\n    with the Buddhist Logos. In order to make my meaning clear I may\r\n    point out here that the Logos has seven forms. In other words,\r\n    there are seven kinds of Logoi in the Cosmos. Each of these has\r\n    became the central figure of one of the seven main branches of the\r\n    ancient Wisdom‐Religion. This classification is not the seven‐fold\r\n    classification we have adopted. I make this assertion without the\r\n    slightest fear of contradiction. The real classification has all\r\n    the requisites of a scientific classification. It has seven\r\n    distinct principles, which correspond with seven distinct states\r\n    of Prajñâ or consciousness. It bridges the gulf between the\r\n    objective and subjective, and indicates the mysterious circuit\r\n    through which ideation passes. The seven principles are allied to\r\n    seven states of matter, and to seven forms of force. These\r\n    principles are harmoniously arranged between two poles, which\r\n    define the limits of _human_ consciousness.(1542)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above is perfectly correct, save, perhaps, on one point. The “seven‐\r\nfold classification” in the Esoteric System has never (to the writer’s\r\nknowledge) been claimed by any one belonging to it, as “the peculiar\r\nproperty of the ‘Trans‐Himâlayan Esoteric Doctrine’ ”; but only as having\r\nsurvived in that old School alone. It is no more the property of the\r\nTrans‐, than it is of the Cis‐Himâlayan Esoteric Doctrine, but is simply\r\nthe common inheritance of all such Schools, left to the Sages of the Fifth\r\nRoot‐Race by the great Siddhas(1543) of the Fourth. Let us remember that\r\nthe Atlanteans became the terrible sorcerers, now celebrated in so many of\r\nthe oldest MSS. of India, only toward their “Fall,” whereby the submersion\r\nof their Continent was brought on. What is claimed is simply that the\r\nWisdom imparted by the “Divine Ones”—born through the Kriyâshaktic powers\r\nof the Third Race before its Fall and separation into sexes—to the Adepts\r\nof the early Fourth Race, has remained in all its pristine purity in a\r\ncertain Brotherhood. The said School or Fraternity being closely connected\r\nwith a certain island of an inland sea—believed in by both Hindûs and\r\nBuddhists, but called “mythical” by Geographers and Orientalists—the less\r\none talks of it, the wiser he will be. Nor can one accept the said “seven‐\r\nfold classification” as having “a closer connection with the Brâhmanical\r\nLogos than with the Buddhist Logos,” since both are identical, whether the\r\none Logos is called Îshvara or Avalokiteshvara, Brahmâ or Padmapâni. These\r\nare, however, very small differences, more fanciful than real, in fact.\r\nBrâhmanism and Buddhism, both viewed from their orthodox aspects, are as\r\ninimical and as irreconcilable as water and oil. Each of these great\r\nbodies, however, has a vulnerable place in its constitution. While even in\r\ntheir esoteric interpretation both can agree but to disagree, once that\r\ntheir respective vulnerable points are confronted, every disagreement must\r\nfall, for the two will find themselves on common ground. The “Achilles’\r\nheel” of orthodox Brâhmanism is the Advaita philosophy, whose followers\r\nare called by the pious “Buddhists in disguise”; as that of orthodox\r\nBuddhism is Northern Mysticism, as represented by the disciples of the\r\nphilosophies of the Yogâchârya School of Âryâsangha and the Mahâyâna, who\r\nare twitted in their turn by their co‐religionists as “Vedântins in\r\ndisguise.” The Esoteric Philosophy of both these can be but one if\r\ncarefully analyzed and compared, as Gautama Buddha and Shankarâchârya are\r\nmost closely connected, if one believes tradition and certain Esoteric\r\nTeachings. Thus every difference between the two will be found one of form\r\nrather than of substance.\r\n\r\nA most mystic discourse, full of septenary symbology, may be found in the\r\n_Anugita_(1544) There the Brâhmana narrates the bliss of having crossed\r\nbeyond the regions of illusion:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In which fancies are the gadflies and mosquitoes, in which grief\r\n    and joy are cold and heat, in which delusion is the blinding\r\n    darkness, in which avarice is the beasts of prey and reptiles, in\r\n    which desire and anger are the obstructors.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sage describes the entrance into and exit from the forest—a symbol for\r\nman’s life‐time—and also that forest itself:(1545)\r\n\r\n\r\n    In that forest are seven large trees [the senses, mind and\r\n    understanding, or Manas and Buddhi, included], seven fruits, and\r\n    seven guests; seven hermitages, seven (forms of) concentration,\r\n    and seven (forms of) initiation. This is the description of the\r\n    forest. That forest is filled with trees producing splendid\r\n    flowers and fruits of five colours.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe senses, says the commentator:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Are called trees, as being producers of the fruits ... pleasures\r\n    and pains ...; the guests are the powers of each sense\r\n    personified—they receive the fruits above described; the\r\n    hermitages are the trees ... in which the guests take shelter; the\r\n    seven forms of concentration are the exclusion from the self of\r\n    the seven functions of the seven senses, etc., already referred\r\n    to; the seven forms of initiation refer to the initiation into the\r\n    higher life, by repudiating as not one’s own the actions of each\r\n    member out of the group of seven.(1546)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe explanation is harmless, if unsatisfactory. Says the Brâhmana,\r\ncontinuing his description:\r\n\r\n\r\n    That forest is filled with trees producing flowers and fruits of\r\n    four colours. That forest is filled with trees producing flowers\r\n    and fruits of three colours, and mixed. That forest is filled with\r\n    trees producing flowers and fruits of two colours, and of\r\n    beautiful colours. That forest is filled with trees producing\r\n    flowers and fruits of one colour, and fragrant. That forest is\r\n    filled [instead of with seven] with two large trees producing\r\n    numerous flowers and fruits of undistinguished colours [mind and\r\n    understanding—the two higher senses, or theosophically, Manas and\r\n    Buddhi]. There is one fire [the Self] here, connected with the\r\n    Brahman,(1547) and having a good mind [or _true knowledge_,\r\n    according to Arjuna Mishra]. And there is fuel here, (namely) the\r\n    five senses [or human passions]. The seven (forms of) emancipation\r\n    from them are the seven (forms of) initiation. The qualities are\r\n    the fruits.... There ... the great sages receive hospitality. And\r\n    when they have been worshipped and have disappeared, another\r\n    forest shines forth, in which _intelligence_ is the tree, and\r\n    emancipation the fruit, and which possesses shade (in the form of)\r\n    tranquillity, which depends on knowledge, which has contentment\r\n    for its water, and which has the Kshetrajña(1548) within for the\r\n    sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, all the above is very plain, and no Theosophist, even among the least\r\nlearned, can fail to understand the allegory. And yet, we see great\r\nOrientalists making a perfect mess of it in their explanations. The “great\r\nsages” who “receive hospitality” are explained as meaning the senses,\r\n“which, having worked _as unconnected with the self_ are finally absorbed\r\ninto it.” But one fails to understand, if the senses are “unconnected”\r\nwith the “Higher Self,” in what manner they can be “absorbed into it.” One\r\nwould think, on the contrary, that it is just because the _personal_\r\nsenses gravitate and strive to be connected with the _impersonal_ Self,\r\nthat the latter, which is Fire, burns the lower five and purifies thereby\r\nthe higher two, “mind and understanding,” or the higher aspects of\r\nManas(1549) and Buddhi. This is quite apparent from the text. The “great\r\nsages” _disappear_ after having “been worshipped.” Worshipped by whom if\r\nthey (the presumed senses) are “unconnected with the self”? By Mind, of\r\ncourse; by Manas (in this case merged in the _sixth sense_) which is not,\r\nand cannot be, the Brahman, the Self, or Kshetrajña—the Soul’s Spiritual\r\nSun. Into the latter, in time, Manas itself must be absorbed. It has\r\nworshipped “great sages” and given hospitality to _terrestrial_ wisdom;\r\nbut once that “another forest shone forth” upon it, it is Intelligence\r\n(Buddhi, the seventh sense, but sixth principle) which is transformed into\r\n_the_ Tree—that Tree whose fruit is emancipation—which finally destroys\r\nthe very roots of the Ashvattha tree, the symbol of _life_ and of its\r\nillusive joys and pleasures. And therefore, those who attain to that state\r\nof emancipation have, in the words of the above‐cited Sage, “no fear\r\nafterwards.” In this state “the end cannot be perceived because it extends\r\non all sides.”\r\n\r\n“There always dwell seven females there,” he goes on to say, carrying out\r\nthe imagery. These females—who, according to Arjuna Mishra, are the Mahat,\r\nAhamkâra and five Tanmâtras—have always their faces turned downwards, as\r\nthey are obstacles in the way of spiritual ascension.\r\n\r\n\r\n    In that same [Brahman, the Self] the seven perfect sages, together\r\n    with their chiefs, ... abide, and again emerge from the same.\r\n    Glory, brilliance and greatness, enlightenment, victory,\r\n    perfection and power—these seven rays follow after this same sun\r\n    [Kshetrajña, the Higher Self].... Those whose wishes are reduced\r\n    [the unselfish]; ... whose sins [passions] are burnt up by\r\n    penance, merging the self in the self,(1550) devote themselves to\r\n    Brahman. Those people who understand the forest of knowledge\r\n    [Brahman, or the Self], praise tranquillity. And aspiring to that\r\n    forest, they are [re‐] born so as not to lose courage. Such,\r\n    indeed, is this holy forest.... And understanding it, they [the\r\n    sages] act (accordingly), being directed by the Kshetrajña.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo translator among the Western Orientalists has yet perceived in the\r\nforegoing allegory anything higher than mysteries connected with\r\nsacrificial ritualism, penance, or ascetic ceremonies, and Hatha Yoga. But\r\nhe who understands symbolical imagery, and hears the voice of _Self within\r\nSelf_, will see in this something far higher than mere ritualism, however\r\noften he may err in minor details of the Philosophy.\r\n\r\nAnd here we must be allowed a last remark. No true Theosophist, from the\r\nmost ignorant up to the most learned, ought to claim infallibility for\r\nanything he may say or write upon Occult matters. The chief point is to\r\nadmit that, in many a way, in the classification of either cosmic or human\r\nprinciples, in addition to mistakes in the order of evolution, and\r\nespecially on metaphysical questions, those of us who pretend to teach\r\nothers more ignorant than ourselves—are all liable to err. Thus mistakes\r\nhave been made in _Isis Unveiled_, in _Esoteric Buddhism_, in _Man_, in\r\n_Magic: White and Black_, etc., and more than one mistake is likely to be\r\nfound in the present work. This cannot be helped. For a large or even a\r\nsmall work on such abstruse subjects to be entirely exempt from error and\r\nblunder, it would have to be written from its first to its last page by a\r\ngreat Adept, if not by an Avatâra. Then only should we say, “This is\r\nverily a work without sin or blemish in it!” But so long as the artist is\r\nimperfect, how can his work be perfect? “Endless is the search for truth!”\r\nLet us love it and aspire to it for its own sake, and not for the glory or\r\nbenefit a minute portion of its revelation may confer on us. For who of us\r\ncan presume to have the _whole_ truth at his fingers’ ends, even upon one\r\nminor teaching of Occultism?\r\n\r\nOur chief point in the present subject, however, has been to show that the\r\nseptenary doctrine, or division of the constitution of man, was a very\r\nancient one, and was not invented by us. This has been successfully done,\r\nfor we are supported in this, consciously and unconsciously, by a number\r\nof ancient, mediæval, and modern writers. What the former said, was well\r\nsaid; what the latter repeated, has generally been distorted. An instance:\r\nRead the Pythagorean Fragments, and study the septenary man as given by\r\nthe Rev. G. Oliver, the learned Mason, in his _Pythagorean Triangle_, who\r\nspeaks as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Theosophic Philosophy ... counted seven properties [or\r\n    principles] in man—viz.:\r\n\r\n    (1) The divine golden man.\r\n\r\n    (2) The inward holy body from fire and light, like pure silver.\r\n\r\n    (3) The elemental man.\r\n\r\n    (4) The mercurial ... paradisiacal man.\r\n\r\n    (5) The martial soul‐like man.\r\n\r\n    (6) The venerine, ascending to the outward desire.\r\n\r\n    (7) The solar man, [a witness to and] an inspector of the wonders\r\n    of God [the Universe].\r\n\r\n    They had also seven fountain spirits or powers of nature.(1551)\r\n\r\n\r\nCompare this jumbled account and distribution of Western Theosophic\r\nPhilosophy with the latest Theosophic explanations by the Eastern School\r\nof Theosophy, and then decide which is the more correct. Verily:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Wisdom hath builded her house,\r\n    She hath hewn out her _seven pillars_.(1552)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to the charge that our School has not adopted the sevenfold\r\nclassification of the Brâhmans, but has confused it, this is quite unjust.\r\nTo begin with, the “School” is one thing, its exponents (to Europeans)\r\nquite another. The latter have first to learn the A B C of practical\r\nEastern Occultism, before they can be made to understand correctly the\r\ntremendously abstruse classification based on the seven distinct states of\r\nPrajñâ or Consciousness; and, above all, to realize thoroughly what Prajñâ\r\n_is_, in Eastern metaphysics. To give a Western student that\r\nclassification is to try to make him suppose that he can account for the\r\norigin of consciousness, by accounting for the process by which a certain\r\nknowledge, though _only one of the states_ of that consciousness, came to\r\nhim; in other words, it is to make him account for something he knows on\r\n_this_ plane, by something he knows nothing about on the other planes;\r\n_i.e._, to lead him from the spiritual and the psychological, direct to\r\nthe ontological. This is why the primary, old classification was adopted\r\nby the Theosophists—of which classifications in truth there are many.\r\n\r\nTo busy oneself, after such a tremendous number of independent witnesses\r\nand proofs have been brought before the public, with an additional\r\nenumeration from theological sources, would be quite useless. The seven\r\ncapital sins and seven virtues of the Christian scheme are far less\r\nphilosophical than even the seven liberal and the seven accursed\r\nsciences—or the seven arts of enchantment of the Gnostics. For one of the\r\nlatter is now before the public, pregnant with danger in the present as\r\nfor the future. The modern name for it is _Hypnotism_; used as it is by\r\nscientific and ignorant Materialists, in the general ignorance of the\r\nseven principles, it will soon become _Satanism_ in the full acceptation\r\nof the term.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III. ADDENDA. SCIENCE AND THE SECRET DOCTRINE CONTRASTED.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The knowledge of this nether world—\r\n      Say, friend, what is it, false or true?\r\n    The false, what mortal cares to know?\r\n      The true, what mortal ever knew?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection I. Archaic, or Modern Anthropology?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhenever the question of the Origin of Man is offered seriously to an\r\nunbiassed, honest, and earnest man of Science, the answer comes\r\ninvariably: “We do not know.” De Quatrefages with his agnostic attitude is\r\none of such Anthropologists.\r\n\r\nThis does not imply that the rest of the men of Science are neither fair‐\r\nminded nor honest, as such a remark would be questionably discreet. But it\r\nis estimated that 75 per cent. of European Scientists are Evolutionists.\r\nAre these representatives of Modern Thought all guilty of flagrant\r\nmisrepresentation of the facts? No one says this—but there are a few very\r\nexceptional cases. However, the Scientists, in their anti‐clerical\r\nenthusiasm and in despair of any alternative theory to Darwinism except\r\nthat of “special creation,” are unconsciously insincere in “forcing” a\r\nhypothesis the elasticity of which is inadequate, and which resents the\r\nsevere strain to which it is now subjected. Insincerity on the same\r\nsubject is, however, patent in ecclesiastical circles. Bishop Temple has\r\ncome forward as a thorough‐going supporter of Darwinism in his _Religion\r\nand Science_. This clerical writer goes so far as to regard Matter—after\r\nit has received its “primal impress”—as the unaided evolver of all cosmic\r\nphenomena. This view only differs from that of Hæckel, in postulating a\r\nhypothetical Deity at “the back of beyont,” a Deity which stands entirely\r\naloof from the interplay of forces. Such a metaphysical entity is no more\r\nthe Theological God than is that of Kant. Bishop Temple’s truce with\r\nmaterialistic Science is, in our opinion, impolitic—apart from the fact\r\nthat it involves a total rejection of the biblical cosmogony. In the\r\npresence of this display of flunkeyism before the materialism of our\r\n“learned” age, we Occultists can but smile. But how about loyalty to the\r\nMaster such theological truants profess to serve—Christ, and Christendom\r\nat large?\r\n\r\nHowever, we have no desire, for the present, to throw down the gauntlet to\r\nthe clergy, our business being now with materialistic Science alone. The\r\nlatter, in the person of its best representatives, answers to our\r\nquestion, “We do not know;” yet the majority of them act as though\r\nOmniscience were their heirloom, and they knew all things.\r\n\r\nFor, indeed, this negative reply has not prevented the majority of\r\nScientists from speculating on the question, each seeking to have his own\r\nspecial theory accepted to the exclusion of all others. Thus, from Maillet\r\nin 1748, down to Hæckel in 1870, theories on the origin of the human race\r\nhave differed as much as the personalities of their inventors themselves.\r\nBuffon, Bory de St. Vincent, Lamarck, E. Geoffroy St. Hilaire, Gaudry,\r\nNaudin, Wallace, Darwin, Owen, Hæckel, Filippi, Vogt, Huxley, Agassiz,\r\netc., each has evolved a more or less scientific hypothesis of genesis. De\r\nQuatrefages arranges these theories in two principal groups—one based on a\r\nrapid, and the other on a very gradual transmutation; the former favouring\r\na new type (man) produced by a being entirely different, the latter\r\nteaching the evolution of man by progressive differentiations.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, it is from the most scientific of these authorities that\r\nhas emanated the most unscientific of all the theories upon the subject of\r\nthe Origin of Man. This is now so evident, that the hour is rapidly\r\napproaching when the current teaching about the descent of man from an\r\nape‐like mammal will be regarded with less respect than the formation of\r\nAdam out of clay, and of Eve out of Adam’s rib. For\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is evident, especially after the most fundamental principles of\r\n    Darwinism, that an organized being cannot be a descendant of\r\n    another whose development is in an inverse order to its own.\r\n    Consequently, in accordance with these principles, man cannot be\r\n    considered as the descendant of any simian type whatever.(1553)\r\n\r\n\r\nLucae’s argument _versus_ the Ape‐theory, based on the different flexures\r\nof the bones constituting the axis of the skull in the cases of man and\r\nthe anthropoids, is fairly discussed by Schmidt. He admits that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The ape as he grows becomes more bestial; man ... more human—\r\n\r\n\r\nand seems, indeed, to hesitate a moment before he passes on:\r\n\r\n\r\n    This flexure of the cranial axis may, therefore, still be\r\n    emphasized as a human character, in contradistinction to the apes;\r\n    the peculiar characteristic of an order can scarcely be elicited\r\n    from it; and especially as to the doctrine of descent, this\r\n    circumstance seems in no way decisive.(1554)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe writer is evidently not a little disquieted by his own argument. He\r\nassures us that it upsets any possibility of the present apes having been\r\nthe progenitors of mankind. But does it not also negative the bare\r\npossibility of the man and the anthropoid having had a common—though, so\r\nfar, an absolutely theoretical—ancestor?\r\n\r\nEven “Natural Selection” itself is with every day more threatened. The\r\ndeserters from the Darwinian camp are many, and those who were at one time\r\nits most ardent disciples are, owing to new discoveries, slowly but\r\nsteadily preparing to turn over a new leaf. In the _Journal of the Royal\r\nMicroscopical Society_ for October, 1886, we may read as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    PHYSIOLOGICAL SELECTION.—Mr. G. J. Romanes finds certain\r\n    difficulties in regarding natural selection as a theory for the\r\n    origin of species, as it is rather a theory of the origin of\r\n    adaptive structures. He proposes to replace it by what he calls\r\n    physiological selection, or segregation of the fit. His view is\r\n    based on the extreme sensitiveness of the reproductive system to\r\n    small changes in the conditions of life, and he thinks that\r\n    variations in the direction of greater or less sterility must\r\n    frequently occur in wild species. If the variation be such that\r\n    the reproductive system, while showing some degree of sterility\r\n    with the parent form, continues to be fertile within the limits of\r\n    the varietal form, the variation would neither be swamped by\r\n    intercrossing nor die out on account of sterility. When a\r\n    variation of this kind occurs, the physiological barrier must\r\n    divide the species into two parts. The author, in fine, regards\r\n    mutual sterility, not as one of the effects of specific\r\n    differentiation, but as the cause of it.(1555)\r\n\r\n\r\nAn attempt is made to show the above to be a complement of, and sequence\r\nto, the Darwinian theory. This is a clumsy attempt at best. The public\r\nwill soon be asked to believe that Mr. C. Dixon’s _Evolution without\r\nNatural Selection_ is also Darwinism—expanded, as the author certainly\r\nclaims it to be!\r\n\r\nBut it is like splitting the body of a man into three pieces, and then\r\nmaintaining that each piece is the identical man he was before,\r\nonly—expanded. Yet the author states:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Let it be clearly understood that not one single syllable in the\r\n    foregoing pages has been written antagonistic to Darwin’s theory\r\n    of Natural Selection. All I have done is to explain _certain_\r\n    phenomena ... the more one studies Darwin’s works, the more one is\r\n    convinced of the truth of his hypothesis [! !].(1556)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd before this, he alludes to:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The overwhelming array of facts which Darwin gave in support of\r\n    his hypothesis, and which triumphantly carried the theory of\r\n    Natural Selection over all obstacles and objections.(1557)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis does not prevent the learned author, however, from upsetting this\r\ntheory as “triumphantly,” and from even openly calling his work\r\n_Evolution_ without _Natural Selection_, or, in so many words, with\r\nDarwin’s fundamental idea knocked to atoms in it.\r\n\r\nAs to Natural Selection itself, the utmost misconception prevails among\r\nmany present‐day thinkers, who tacitly accept the conclusions of\r\nDarwinism. It is, for instance, a mere device of rhetoric to credit\r\nNatural Selection with the power of _originating_ species. Natural\r\nSelection is no entity; it is merely a convenient phrase for describing\r\nthe mode in which the survival of the fit and the elimination of the unfit\r\namong organisms are brought about by the Struggle for Existence. Every\r\ngroup of organisms tends to multiply beyond the means of subsistence; the\r\nconstant battle for life—the “struggle to obtain enough to eat and to\r\nescape being eaten” added to the environmental conditions—necessitates a\r\nperpetual weeding out of the unfit. The _élite_ of any stock, thus sorted\r\nout, propagate the species and transmit their organic characteristics to\r\ntheir descendants. All useful variations are thus perpetuated, and a\r\nprogressive improvement is effected. But Natural Selection—in the writer’s\r\nhumble opinion, “Selection, _as a Power_”—is in reality a pure myth;\r\nespecially when it is resorted to as an explanation of the Origin of\r\nSpecies. It is merely a representative term expressive of the manner in\r\nwhich “useful variations” are stereotyped when produced. Of itself, “it”\r\ncan _produce_—_nothing_, and only operates on the rough material presented\r\nto “it.” The real question at issue is: What _cause_—combined with other\r\nsecondary causes—produces the “variations” in the organisms themselves?\r\nMany of these secondary causes are purely physical—climatic, dietary, etc.\r\nVery well. But beyond the secondary aspects of organic evolution, a deeper\r\nprinciple has to be sought for. The Materialist’s “spontaneous\r\nvariations,” and “_accidental_ divergencies” are self‐contradictory terms\r\nin a universe of “Matter, Force and _Necessity_.” Mere variability of\r\ntype, apart from the supervisory presence of a quasi‐intelligent impulse,\r\nis powerless to account for the stupendous complexities and marvels of the\r\nhuman body, for instance. The insufficiency of the Darwinists’ mechanical\r\ntheory has been exposed at length by Dr. Von Hartmann among other purely\r\nnegative thinkers. It is an abuse of the reader’s intelligence to write,\r\nas does Hæckel, of _blind_ indifferent cells, “arranging themselves into\r\norgans.” The Esoteric solution of the origin of animal species is given\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nThose purely _secondary_ causes of differentiation, grouped under the head\r\nof sexual selection, natural selection, climate, isolation, etc., mislead\r\nthe Western Evolutionist and offer no real explanation whatever of the\r\n“whence” of the “ancestral types” which served as the _starting point_ for\r\nphysical development. The truth is that the differentiating “causes” known\r\nto Modern Science only come into operation after the _physicalization of\r\nthe primeval animal root‐types out of the astral_. Darwinism only meets\r\nEvolution at its midway point—that is to say, when astral evolution has\r\ngiven place to the play of the ordinary physical forces with which our\r\npresent senses acquaint us. But even here the Darwinian Theory, even with\r\nthe “expansions” recently attempted, is inadequate to meet the facts of\r\nthe case. The cause underlying physiological variation in species—one to\r\nwhich all other laws are subordinate and secondary—is a sub‐conscious\r\nintelligence pervading matter, ultimately traceable to a _reflection_ of\r\nthe Divine and Dhyân‐Chohanic wisdom.(1558) A not altogether dissimilar\r\nconclusion has been arrived at by so well known a thinker as Ed. von\r\nHartmann, who, despairing of the efficacy of _unaided_ Natural Selection,\r\nregards Evolution as being intelligently guided by the Unconscious—the\r\nCosmic Logos of Occultism. But the latter acts only mediately through\r\nFohat, or Dhyân‐Chohanic energy, and not quite in the direct manner which\r\nthe great pessimist describes.\r\n\r\nIt is this divergence among men of Science, their mutual, and often their\r\n_self_‐contradictions, that gives the writer of the present volumes the\r\ncourage to bring to light other and older teachings—if only as hypotheses\r\nfor _future_ scientific appreciation. So evident, even to the humble\r\nrecorder of this archaic teaching, though not in any way very learned in\r\nModern Sciences, are the scientific fallacies and gaps, that she has\r\ndetermined to touch upon all these, in order to place the two teachings on\r\nparallel lines. For Occultism, it is a question of self‐defence, and\r\nnothing more.\r\n\r\nSo far, _The Secret Doctrine_ has concerned itself with metaphysics, pure\r\nand simple. It has now landed on Earth, and finds itself within the domain\r\nof physical Science and practical Anthropology, or those branches of study\r\nwhich materialistic Naturalists claim as their rightful domain, coolly\r\nasserting, furthermore, that the higher and more perfect the working of\r\nthe Soul, the more amenable it is to the analysis and explanations _of the\r\nZoologist and the Physiologist alone_.(1559) This stupendous pretension\r\ncomes from one, who, to prove his pithecoid descent, has not hesitated to\r\ninclude the Lemuridæ among the ancestors of man; these have been promoted\r\nby him to the rank of Prosimiæ, _indeciduate_ mammals, to which he very\r\nincorrectly contributes a _decidua_ and a discoidal placenta.(1560) For\r\nthis Hæckel was taken severely to task by de Quatrefages, and criticised\r\nby his own brother Materialists and Agnostics—Virchow and du Bois‐Reymond,\r\nas great, if not greater authorities than himself.(1561)\r\n\r\nSuch opposition notwithstanding, Hæckel’s wild theories are, to this day,\r\nstill called by some scientific and logical. The mysterious nature of\r\nConsciousness, of Soul, of Spirit in Man being now explained as a mere\r\nadvance on the functions of the protoplasmic molecules of the lively\r\nProtista, and the gradual evolution and growth of human mind and “social\r\ninstincts” toward civilization having to be traced back to their origin in\r\nthe civilization of ants, bees, and other creatures—the chances left for\r\nan impartial hearing of the doctrines of Archaic Wisdom are few indeed.\r\nThe _educated_ profane are told that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The social instincts of the lower animals have, of late, been\r\n    regarded for various reasons _as clearly the origin of morals_,\r\n    even of those of man [?], ...\r\n\r\n\r\n—and that our divine consciousness, our soul, intellect, and aspirations\r\nhave worked their “way up from the lower stages of the simple cell‐soul”\r\nof the gelatinous Bathybius—(1562) and they seem to believe it. For such\r\nmen, the Metaphysics of Occultism must produce the effect that our\r\ngrandest oratorios produce on the Chinaman—sounds that jar upon their\r\nnerves.\r\n\r\nYet, are our Esoteric teachings about “Angels,” the first three pre‐animal\r\nhuman Races, and the downfall of the Fourth, _on a lower level of fiction\r\nand self‐delusion_ than the Hæckelian “plastidular,” or the inorganic\r\n“molecular souls of the Protista”? Between the evolution of the spiritual\r\nnature of man from the above amœbian souls, and the alleged development of\r\nhis physical frame from the protoplastic dweller in the ocean slime, there\r\nis an abyss which will not easily be crossed by any man in the _full_\r\npossession of his intellectual faculties. Physical Evolution, as Modern\r\nScience teaches it, is a subject for open controversy; spiritual and moral\r\ndevelopment on the same lines is the insane dream of a crass Materialism.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, past as well as present daily experience teaches that no\r\ntruth has ever been accepted by learned bodies unless it has dovetailed\r\nwith the habitually preconceived ideas of their professors. “The crown of\r\nthe innovator is a crown of thorns”—said Geoffroy St. Hilaire. It is only\r\nthat which fits in with popular hobbies and accepted notions that as a\r\ngeneral rule gains ground. Hence the triumph of the Hæckelian ideas,\r\nnotwithstanding that they are proclaimed by Virchow, du Bois‐Reymond, and\r\nothers as the “_testimonium paupertatis_ of Natural Science.”\r\n\r\nDiametrically opposed as may be the materialism of the German\r\nEvolutionists to the spiritual conceptions of Esoteric Philosophy,\r\nradically inconsistent as is their accepted anthropological system with\r\nthe real facts of Nature—the pseudo‐idealistic bias now colouring English\r\nthought is almost more pernicious. The pure Materialistic Doctrine admits\r\nof a direct refutation and an appeal to the logic of facts. The Idealism\r\nof the present day, not only contrives to absorb, on the one hand, the\r\nbasic negations of Atheism, but lands its votaries in a tangle of\r\n_unreality_, which culminates in a practical Nihilism. Argument with such\r\nwriters is almost out of the question. Idealists, therefore, will be still\r\nmore antagonistic than even the Materialists to the Occult teachings now\r\ngiven. But as no worse fate can befall the exponents of Esoteric\r\nAnthropogenesis at the hands of their foes than being openly called by\r\ntheir old and time‐honoured names of “lunatics” and “ignoramuses,” the\r\npresent archaic theories may be safely added to the many modern\r\nspeculations, and bide their time for their full or even partial\r\nrecognition. Only, as the very existence of these archaic theories will\r\nprobably be denied, we have to give our best proofs and stand by them to\r\nthe bitter end.\r\n\r\nIn our race and generation the one “temple in the universe” is in rare\r\ncases—_within_ us; but our body and mind have been too defiled by both\r\n“sin” and “science” to be outwardly anything better _now_ than a fane of\r\niniquity and error. And here our mutual position—that of Occultism and\r\nModern Science—ought to be once for all defined.\r\n\r\nWe, Theosophists, are willing to bow before such men of learning as the\r\nlate Prof. Balfour Stewart, Messrs. Crookes, de Quatrefages, Wallace,\r\nAgassiz, Butlerof, and others, though, from the stand‐point of the\r\nEsoteric Philosophy, we may not agree with all they say. But nothing will\r\nmake us consent to even a show of respect for the opinions of such other\r\nmen of Science as Hæckel, Carl Vogt, or Ludwig Büchner, in Germany, or\r\neven Mr. Huxley and his co‐thinkers in Materialism in England—the colossal\r\nerudition of the first named, notwithstanding. Such men are simply the\r\nintellectual and moral murderers of future generations; especially Hæckel,\r\nwhose crass Materialism often rises to the height of idiotic _naivetés_ in\r\nhis reasonings. One has but to read his _Pedigree of Man, and Other\r\nEssays_ (Aveling’s Translation) to feel a desire that, in the words of\r\nJob, his remembrance should perish from the Earth, and that he “shall have\r\nno name in the streets.” Hear the creator of the mythical Sozura deriding\r\nthe idea of the origin of the human race “as a supernatural [?]\r\nphenomenon,” as one—\r\n\r\n\r\n    That could not result from simple mechanical causes, from physical\r\n    and chemical forces, but requires the direct intervention of a\r\n    creative personality.... Now the central point of Darwin’s\r\n    teaching ... lies in this, that it demonstrates the simplest\r\n    mechanical causes, purely physico‐chemical phenomena of nature, as\r\n    wholly sufficient to explain the highest and most difficult\r\n    problems. Darwin puts in the place of a conscious creative force,\r\n    building and arranging the organic bodies of animals and plants on\r\n    a designed plan, a series of natural forces working blindly (as we\r\n    say) without aim, without design. In place of an arbitrary act of\r\n    operation, we have a necessary law of Evolution.... [So had Manu\r\n    and Kapila, and, at the same time, guiding, conscious and\r\n    intelligent Powers]. Darwin very wisely ... had put on one side\r\n    the question as to the first appearance of life. But very soon\r\n    that consequence, so full of meaning, so wide‐reaching, was openly\r\n    discussed by able and brave scientific men, such as Huxley, Carl\r\n    Vogt, Ludwig Büchner. A mechanical origin of the earliest living\r\n    form was held as the necessary sequence to Darwin’s teaching ...\r\n    we are at present only concerned with a single consequence of the\r\n    theory, the natural origin of the human race through almighty\r\n    Evolution.(1563)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this, unabashed by such a scientific farrago, Occultism replies: In the\r\ncourse of Evolution, when the physical triumphed over the spiritual and\r\nmental evolution, and nearly crushed it under its weight, the great gift\r\nof Kriyâshakti remained the heirloom of only a few elect men in every age.\r\nSpirit strove vainly to _manifest itself in its fulness in purely organic\r\nforms_ (as has been explained in Part I of this Volume), and the faculty,\r\nwhich had been a natural attribute in the early humanity of the Third\r\nRace, became one of the class regarded as simply phenomenal by\r\nSpiritualists and Occultists, and as _scientifically impossible_ by\r\nMaterialists.\r\n\r\nIn our modern day the mere assertion that there exists a power which can\r\ncreate human forms—ready‐made Sheaths within which can incarnate the\r\n_conscious_ Monads or Nirmânakâyas of past Manvantaras—is, of course,\r\nabsurd, ridiculous! That which is regarded as quite natural, on the other\r\nhand, is the production of a Frankenstein’s monster, _plus_ moral\r\nconsciousness, religious aspirations, genius, and a feeling of his own\r\nimmortal nature within himself—by “physico‐chemical forces,” guided by\r\nblind “Almighty Evolution.” As to the origin of that man, not _ex nihilo_,\r\ncemented by a little red clay, but from a living divine Entity\r\nconsolidating the Astral Body with surrounding materials—such a conception\r\nis too absurd even to be mentioned, in the opinion of the Materialists.\r\nNevertheless, Occultists and Theosophists are ready to have their claims\r\nand theories compared as to their intrinsic value and probability with\r\nthose of the modern Evolutionists—however unscientific and superstitious\r\nthese theories may at the first glance appear. Hence the Esoteric teaching\r\nis _absolutely_ opposed to the Darwinian evolution, as applied to man, and\r\n_partially_ so with regard to other species.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to obtain a glimpse of the mental representation\r\nof Evolution in the scientific brain of a Materialist. What _is_\r\nEvolution? If asked to define the full and complete meaning of the term,\r\nneither Huxley nor Hæckel will be able to do so any better than does\r\nWebster:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The act of unfolding; the process of growth, development; as the\r\n    evolution of a flower from a bud, or an animal from the egg.\r\n\r\n\r\nYet the bud must be traced through its parent‐plant to the seed, and the\r\negg to the animal or bird that laid it; or at any rate to the speck of\r\nprotoplasm from which it expanded and grew. And both the seed and the\r\nspeck must have the latent potentialities in them for the reproduction and\r\ngradual development, the unfolding of the thousand and one forms or phases\r\nof evolution, through which they must pass before the flower or the animal\r\nis fully developed? Hence, the future plan—if not a design—_must be\r\nthere_. Moreover, that seed _has to be traced_, and its nature\r\nascertained. Have the Darwinians been successful in this? Or will the\r\nMoneron be cast in our teeth? But this atom of the Watery Abysses is _not_\r\nhomogeneous matter; and there must be something or somebody that had\r\nmoulded and cast it into being.\r\n\r\nHere Science is once more silent. But since there is no self‐consciousness\r\nas yet in speck, seed, or germ, according to both Materialists and\r\nPsychologists of the modern school—Occultists agreeing in this for once\r\nwith their natural enemies—what is it that guides the force or forces so\r\nunerringly in this process of Evolution? “Blind force”? As well call\r\n“blind” the brain which evolved in Hæckel his _Pedigree of Man_ and other\r\nlucubrations. We can easily conceive that the said brain lacks an\r\nimportant centre or two; for whoever knows anything of the anatomy of the\r\nhuman, or even of any animal, body, and is still an Atheist and a\r\nMaterialist, must be “hopelessly insane,” according to Lord Herbert, who\r\nrightly sees in the frame of man’s body and the coherence of its parts,\r\nsomething so strange and paradoxical that he holds it to be the “greatest\r\nmiracle of nature.” _Blind_ forces and “_no_ design” in anything under the\r\nSun! When no sane man of Science would hesitate to say that, even from the\r\nlittle he knows and has hitherto discovered of the forces at work in\r\nKosmos, he sees very plainly that every part, every speck and atom, are in\r\nharmony with their fellow atoms, and these with the whole, each having its\r\ndistinct mission throughout the life‐cycle. But, fortunately, the\r\ngreatest, the most eminent Thinkers and Scientists of the day are now\r\nbeginning to rise against this “Pedigree,” and even against Darwin’s\r\nNatural Selection theory, though its author had never, probably,\r\ncontemplated such widely stretched conclusions. The Russian scientist N.\r\nT. Danilevsky, in his remarkable work, _Darwinism, a Critical\r\nInvestigation of the Theory_, upsets such Darwinism completely and without\r\nappeal, and so does de Quatrefages in his last work. Our readers are\r\nrecommended to examine the learned paper by Dr. Bourges, a member of the\r\nParis Anthropological Society, read by its author at a recent meeting of\r\nthat society and called “Evolutionary Psychology; the Evolution of Spirit,\r\netc.” In it he completely reconciles the two teachings—namely of physical\r\nand spiritual evolution. He explains the origin of the variety of organic\r\nforms—which are made to fit their environments with such evidently\r\nintelligent design—by the existence and the mutual help and interaction of\r\ntwo Principles in manifested Nature, the inner conscious Principle\r\nadapting itself to physical Nature and the innate potentialities of the\r\nlatter. Thus the French scientist has to return to our old friend Archæus,\r\nor the Life‐Principle—without naming it—as Dr. Richardson has done in\r\nEngland in his Nerve‐Force. The same idea was recently developed in\r\nGermany by Baron Hellenbach, in his remarkable work, _Individuality in the\r\nLight of Biology and Modern Philosophy_.\r\n\r\nWe find the same conclusions arrived at in yet another excellent volume by\r\na deep thinking Russian, N. N. Strachof, who says in his _Fundamental\r\nConceptions of Psychology and Physiology_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The most clear, as the most familiar, type of development may be\r\n    found in our own mental or physical evolution, which has served\r\n    others as a model to follow.... If organisms are entities ... then\r\n    it is only just to conclude and assert that the organic life\r\n    strives to beget psychic life; but it would be still more correct\r\n    and in accordance with the spirit of these two categories of\r\n    evolution to say, that the true cause of organic life is the\r\n    tendency of spirit to manifest in substantial forms, to clothe\r\n    itself in substantial reality. It is the highest form which\r\n    contains the complete explanation of the lowest, never the\r\n    reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is admitting, as Bourges does in the Mémoire above mentioned, the\r\nidentity of this mysterious, integrally acting and organizing Principle\r\nwith the Self‐Conscious and Inner Subject, which we call the Ego and the\r\nworld at large the Soul. Thus all the best Scientists and Thinkers are\r\ngradually approaching the Occultists in their general conclusions.\r\n\r\nBut such metaphysically inclined men of Science are out of court and will\r\nhardly be listened to. Schiller, in his magnificent poem on the Veil of\r\nIsis, makes the mortal youth who dared to lift the impenetrable covering\r\nfall down dead, after beholding the naked Truth in the face of the stern\r\nGoddess. Have some of our Darwinians, so tenderly united in natural\r\nselection and affinity, also gazed at the Saïtic Mother bereft of her\r\nveils? One might almost suspect it after reading their theories. Their\r\ngreat intellects must have collapsed while gauging too closely the\r\nuncovered face of Nature, leaving only the grey matter and ganglia in\r\ntheir brains to respond to “blind” physico‐chemical forces. At any rate\r\nShakspere’s lines apply admirably to our modern Evolutionist, who\r\nsymbolizes that “proud man,” who—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Drest in a little brief authority;\r\n    Most ignorant of what he’s most assured,\r\n    His glassy essence, like an angry ape,\r\n    Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven,\r\n    As make the angels weep!(1564)\r\n\r\n\r\nThese have nought to do with the “Angels.” Their only concern is with the\r\nhuman ancestor, the pithecoid Noah who gave birth to three sons—the tailed\r\nCynocephalus, the tailless Ape, and the “arboreal” Palæolithic man. On\r\nthis point, they will not be contradicted. Every doubt expressed is\r\nimmediately set down as an attempt to cripple scientific enquiry. The\r\ninsuperable difficulty at the very foundation of the Evolution theory,\r\nnamely, that no Darwinian is able to give even an approximate definition\r\nof the period _at_ which, and the form _in_ which, the first man appeared,\r\nis smoothed down to a trifling impediment, which is “really of no\r\naccount.” Every branch of knowledge is in the same predicament, we are\r\ninformed. The Chemist bases his most abstruse calculations simply\r\n\r\n\r\n    Upon a hypothesis of atoms and molecules, of which not one has\r\n    ever been seen, isolated, weighed, or defined. The electrician\r\n    speaks of magnetic fluids which have never tangibly revealed\r\n    themselves. No definite origin can be assigned either to molecules\r\n    or magnetism. Science cannot and does not pretend to any knowledge\r\n    of the beginnings of law, matter, or life.(1565)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd, withal, to reject a _scientific hypothesis_, however absurd, is to\r\ncommit the one unpardonable sin! We risk it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection II. The Ancestors Mankind is Offered by Science.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The question of questions for mankind—the problem which underlies\r\n    all others, and is more deeply interesting than any other—is the\r\n    ascertainment of the place which man occupies in Nature, and of\r\n    his relations to the universe of things.(1566)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe world stands divided this day and hesitates between _Divine\r\nProgenitors_—be they Adam and Eve or the Lunar Pitris—and _Bathybius\r\nHæckelii_, the gelatinous hermit of the briny deep. Having explained the\r\nOccult theory, it may now be compared with that of Modern Materialism. The\r\nreader is invited to choose between the two after having judged them on\r\ntheir respective merits.\r\n\r\nWe may derive some consolation for the rejection of our Divine Ancestors,\r\nin finding that the Hæckelian speculations receive no better treatment at\r\nthe hands of strictly _exact_ Science than do our own. Hæckel’s\r\nPhylogenesis is no less laughed at by the foes of his fantastic evolution,\r\nby other and greater Scientists, than our primeval Races will be. As du\r\nBois‐Reymond puts it, we may believe him easily when he says that the\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ancestral trees of our race sketched in the _Schöpfungsgeschichte_\r\n    are of about as much value as are the pedigrees of the Homeric\r\n    heroes in the eyes of the historical critic.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis settled, everyone will see that one hypothesis is as good as another.\r\nAnd as we find Hæckel himself confessing that neither Geology in its\r\nhistory of the past nor the ancestral history of organisms will ever “rise\r\nto the position of a real ‘exact’ science,”(1567) a large margin is thus\r\nleft to Occult Science to make its annotations and lodge its protests. The\r\nworld is left to choose between the teachings of Paracelsus, the “father\r\nof modern chemistry,” and those of Hæckel, the “father of the mythical\r\nSozura.” We demand no more.\r\n\r\nWithout presuming to take part in the quarrel of such very learned\r\nNaturalists as du Bois‐Reymond and Hæckel _à propos_ of our blood\r\nrelationship to\r\n\r\n\r\n    Those ancestors [of ours] which have led up from the unicellular\r\n    classes, Vermes, Acrania, Pisces, Amphibia, Reptilia to the Aves\r\n\r\n\r\n—we may put a brief question or two, for the information of our readers.\r\nAvailing ourselves of the opportunity, and bearing in mind Darwin’s\r\ntheories of Natural Selection, etc., we would ask Science—with regard to\r\nthe origin of the human and animal species—which theory of Evolution of\r\nthe two herewith described is the more scientific, or the more\r\nunscientific, if so preferred.\r\n\r\n(1) Is it that of an Evolution which starts from the beginning with sexual\r\npropagation?\r\n\r\n(2) Or that teaching which shows the gradual development of organs; their\r\nsolidification, and the procreation of each species, at first by simple\r\neasy separation from one into two or even several individuals; then a\r\nfresh development—the first step to a species of separate distinct\r\nsexes—the hermaphrodite condition; then again, a kind of parthenogenesis,\r\n“virginal reproduction,” when the egg‐cells are formed within the body,\r\nissuing from it in atomic emanations and becoming matured outside of it;\r\nuntil, finally, after a definite separation into sexes, the human beings\r\nbegin procreating through sexual connection?\r\n\r\nOf these two, the first “theory”—or rather, a “revealed fact”—is\r\nenunciated by all the exoteric Bibles, except the _Purânas_, preëminently\r\nby the Jewish Cosmogony. The second is that which is taught by the Occult\r\nPhilosophy, as has been explained.\r\n\r\nAn answer is found to our question in a volume just published by Mr.\r\nSamuel Laing—the best lay exponent of Modern Science.(1568) In Chapter\r\nviii of his latest work, _A Modern Zoroastrian_, the author begins by\r\ntwitting “all ancient religions and philosophies” for “assuming a male and\r\nfemale principle for their gods.” At first sight, he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    This distinction of sex appears as fundamental as that of plant\r\n    and animal.... The Spirit of God brooding over Chaos and producing\r\n    the world is only a later edition, revised according to\r\n    monotheistic ideas, of the far older Chaldean legend which\r\n    describes the creation of Cosmos out of Chaos by the coöperation\r\n    of great gods, male and female.... Thus, in the orthodox Christian\r\n    creed we are taught to repeat “begotten, not made,” a phrase which\r\n    is absolute nonsense, or _non‐sense_—that is, an instance of using\r\n    words like counterfeit notes, which have no solid value of an idea\r\n    behind them. For “begotten” is a very definite term, which implies\r\n    the conjunction of two opposite sexes to produce a new\r\n    individual.(1569)\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever we may agree with the learned author as to the inadvisability of\r\nusing wrong words, and the terrible anthropomorphic and phallic element in\r\nthe old Scriptures—especially in the orthodox Christian\r\n_Bible_—nevertheless, there may be two extenuating circumstances in the\r\ncase. Firstly, all these “ancient philosophies” and “modern religions”\r\nare—as has been sufficiently shown in these two Volumes—an exoteric veil\r\nthrown over the face of Esoteric Truth; and—as the direct result of\r\nthis—they are allegorical, _i.e._, mythological in form; but still they\r\nare immensely more philosophical in essence than any of the new scientific\r\ntheories, so‐called. Secondly, from the Orphic Theogony down to Ezra’s\r\nlast remodelling of the Pentateuch, every old Scripture, having in its\r\norigin borrowed its facts from the East, has been subjected to constant\r\nalterations by friend and foe, until of the original version there has\r\nremained but the name, a dead shell from which the spirit had been\r\ngradually eliminated.\r\n\r\nThis alone ought to show that no religious work now extant can be\r\nunderstood without the help of the Archaic Wisdom, the primitive\r\nfoundation on which they were all built.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the direct answer expected from Science to our direct\r\nquestion. It is given by the same author, when, following his train of\r\nthought on the unscientific euhemerization of the powers of Nature in\r\nancient creeds, he pronounces a condemnatory verdict upon them in the\r\nfollowing terms:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Science, however, makes sad havoc with this impression of sexual\r\n    generation being the original and only mode of reproduction, and\r\n    the microscope and dissecting knife of the naturalist introduce us\r\n    to new and altogether unsuspected [?] worlds of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo little “unsuspected,” indeed, that the original a‐sexual “modes of\r\nreproduction” must have been known to the ancient Hindûs, at any rate—Mr.\r\nLaing’s assertion to the contrary notwithstanding. In view of the\r\nstatement in the _Vishnu Purâna_, quoted by us elsewhere, that Daksha\r\n“established sexual intercourse as the means of multiplication,” only\r\nafter a series of other “modes,” which are all enumerated therein,(1570)\r\nit becomes difficult to deny the fact. This assertion, moreover, is found,\r\nnote well, in an _exoteric_ work. Next, Mr. Laing goes on to tell us that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    By far the larger proportion of living forms, in number at any\r\n    rate if not in size, have come into existence, without the aid of\r\n    sexual propagation.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe then instances Hæckel’s Moneron, “multiplying by self‐division.” The\r\nnext stage the author shows in the nucleated cell, “which does exactly the\r\nsame thing.” The following stage is that in\r\n\r\n\r\n    Which the organism does not divide into two equal parts, but a\r\n    small portion of it swells out ... and finally parts company and\r\n    starts on a separate existence, which grows to the size of the\r\n    parent by its inherent faculty of manufacturing fresh protoplasm\r\n    from surrounding inorganic materials.(1571)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is followed by a many‐celled organism which is formed by\r\n\r\n\r\n    Germ‐buds reduced to spores, or single cells, which are emitted\r\n    from the parent.... We are now at the threshold of that system of\r\n    sexual propagation, which has [now] become the rule in all the\r\n    higher families of animals.... This organism, having advantages in\r\n    the struggle for life, established itself permanently ... and\r\n    special organs developed to meet the altered conditions. Thus at\r\n    length the distinction would be firmly established of a female\r\n    organ or ovary containing the egg or primitive cell from which the\r\n    new being was to be developed, and a male organ supplying the\r\n    fertilizing spore or cell.... This is confirmed by a study of\r\n    embryology, which shows that in the _human_ and higher animal\r\n    species the distinction of sex is not developed until a\r\n    considerable progress has been made in the growth of the\r\n    embryo.... In the great majority of plants, and in some of the\r\n    lower families of animals ... the male and female organs are\r\n    developed within the same being, and they are what is called\r\n    hermaphrodites. Another transition form is Parthenogenesis, or\r\n    virginal reproduction, in which germ‐cells, apparently similar in\r\n    all respects to egg‐cells, develop themselves into new\r\n    individuals, without any fructifying element.(1572)\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all this we are as perfectly well aware as we are aware that the above\r\nwas never applied by the very learned English popularizer of Huxley‐\r\nHæckelian theories to the _genus homo_. He limits this to specks of\r\nprotoplasm, plants, bees, snails, and so on. But if he would be true to\r\nthe theory of descent, he must be as true to ontogenesis, in which the\r\nfundamental biogenetic law, we are told, runs as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The development of the embryo (ontogeny) is a condensed and\r\n    abbreviated repetition of the evolution of the race (phylogeny).\r\n    This repetition is the more complete, the more the true original\r\n    order of evolution (palingenesis) has been retained by continual\r\n    heredity. On the other hand, this repetition is the less complete,\r\n    the more by varying adaptations the later spurious development\r\n    (cænogenesis) has obtained.(1573)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis shows us that every living creature and thing on Earth, including\r\nman, evolved from _one common primal form_. Physical man must have passed\r\nthrough the same stages of the evolutionary process in the various modes\r\nof procreation as other animals have done; he must have _divided_ himself;\r\nthen, hermaphrodite, have given birth _parthenogenetically_ (on the\r\nimmaculate principle) to his young ones; the next stage would be the\r\n_oviparous_—at first “without any fructifying element,” then “with the\r\nhelp of the fertilitary spore”; and only after the final and definite\r\nevolution of both sexes, would he become a distinct “male and female,”\r\nwhen reproduction through sexual union would grow into universal law. So\r\nfar, all this is scientifically proven. There remains but one thing to be\r\nascertained; viz., the plain and comprehensively described processes of\r\nsuch ante‐sexual reproduction. This is done in the Occult books, a slight\r\noutline of which has been attempted by the writer in Part I of this\r\nVolume.\r\n\r\nEither this, or—man is a distinct being. Occult Philosophy may call him\r\nthat, because of his distinctly _dual_ nature. Science cannot do so, once\r\nthat it rejects every interference save mechanical laws, and admits of no\r\nprinciple outside Matter. The former—Archaic Science—allows the human\r\nphysical frame to have passed through every form, from the lowest to the\r\nvery highest, its present one, or from the simple to the complex—to use\r\nthe accepted terms. But it claims that in this Cycle, the Fourth, the\r\nframe having already existed among the types and models of Nature from the\r\npreceding Rounds—it was quite ready for man from the beginning of this\r\nRound.(1574) The Monad had but to step into the Astral Body of the\r\nProgenitors, in order that the work of physical consolidation should begin\r\naround the shadowy prototype.(1575)\r\n\r\nWhat would Science say to this? It would answer, of course, that as man\r\nappeared on Earth as the latest of the mammalians, he had no need, any\r\nmore than these mammals, to pass through the primitive stages of\r\nprocreation as above described. His mode of procreation was already\r\nestablished on Earth when he appeared. In this case, we may reply: Since\r\nto this day not the remotest sign of a link between man and the animal has\r\nyet been found, then (if the Occult Doctrine is to be repudiated) he must\r\nhave sprung _miraculously_ in Nature, like a fully armed Minerva from\r\nJupiter’s brain; and in such case the _Bible_ is right, along with other\r\nnational “revelations.” Hence the scientific scorn, so freely lavished by\r\nthe author of _A Modern Zoroastrian_ upon ancient philosophies and\r\nexoteric creeds, becomes premature and uncalled for. Nor would the sudden\r\ndiscovery of a “missing‐link”‐like fossil mend matters at all. For neither\r\none such solitary specimen nor the scientific inductions therefrom, could\r\ninsure its being the long‐sought‐for relic, _i.e._, that of an\r\nundeveloped, still a once‐speaking, Man. Something more would be required\r\nas a final proof. Besides this, even _Genesis_ takes up man, her Adam of\r\ndust, only where the Secret Doctrine leaves her “Sons of God and Wisdom”\r\nand picks up the physical man of the Third Race. Eve is _not_ “begotten,”\r\nbut is extracted out of Adam in the manner of “Amœba A,” contracting in\r\nthe middle and splitting into Amœba B—by division.(1576)\r\n\r\nNor has human speech developed from the various animal sounds. Hæckel’s\r\ntheory that “speech arose gradually from a few simple, crude animal\r\nsounds,” as such “speech still remains amongst a few races of lowest\r\nrank,”(1577) is altogether unsound, as argued by Professor Max Müller,\r\namong others. He contends that no plausible explanation has yet been given\r\nas to how the “roots” of language came into existence. A _human_ brain is\r\nnecessary for _human_ speech. And figures relating to the size of the\r\nrespective brains of man and ape show how deep is the gulf which separates\r\nthe two. Vogt says that the brain of the largest ape, the gorilla,\r\nmeasures no more than 30·51 cubic inches; while the average brains of the\r\nflat‐headed Australian natives—the lowest now of the human races—amount to\r\n99·35 cubic inches! Figures are awkward witnesses and cannot lie.\r\nTherefore, as truly observed by Dr. F. Pfaff, whose premises are as sound\r\nand correct as his biblical conclusions are silly:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The brain of the apes most like man does not amount to quite a\r\n    third of the brain of the lowest races of men: it is not half the\r\n    size of the brain of a new‐born child.(1578)\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing it is thus very easy to perceive that in order to prove\r\nthe Huxley‐Hæckelian theories of the descent of man, it is not one, but a\r\ngreat number of “missing links”—a true ladder of progressive evolutionary\r\nsteps—that would have to be first found and then presented by Science to\r\nthinking and reasoning humanity, before it would abandon belief in Gods\r\nand the immortal Soul for the worship of quadrumanic ancestors. Mere myths\r\nare now greeted as “axiomatic truths.” Even Alfred Russel Wallace\r\nmaintains with Hæckel that primitive man was a speechless ape‐creature. To\r\nthis Prof. Joly answers:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Man never was, in my opinion, this pithecanthropus alalus whose\r\n    portrait Hæckel has drawn as if he had seen and known him, whose\r\n    singular and completely hypothetical genealogy he has even given,\r\n    from the mere mass of living protoplasm to the man endowed with\r\n    speech and a civilization analogous to that of the Australians and\r\n    Papuans.(1579)\r\n\r\n\r\nHæckel, among other things, often comes into direct conflict with the\r\n“science of languages.” In the course of his attack on Evolutionism(1580)\r\nProf. Max Müller stigmatized the Darwinian theory as “vulnerable at the\r\nbeginning and at the end.” The fact is, that only the partial truth of\r\nmany of the secondary “laws” of Darwinism is beyond question—M. de\r\nQuatrefages evidently accepting natural selection, the struggle for\r\nexistence, and transformation within species, as proven not once and for\r\never, but only _pro tempore_. But it may not be amiss, perhaps, to\r\ncondense the linguistic case against the “ape ancestor” theory:\r\n\r\nLanguages have their phases of growth, etc., like all else in Nature. It\r\nis almost certain that the great linguistic families pass through three\r\nstages.\r\n\r\n(1) All words are roots and are merely placed in juxtaposition (Radical\r\nlanguages).\r\n\r\n(2) One root defines the other, and becomes merely a determinative element\r\n(Agglutinative).\r\n\r\n(3) The determinative element (the determinating meaning of which has long\r\nlapsed) unites into a whole with the formative element (Inflected).\r\n\r\nThe problem then is: Whence these roots? Prof. Max Müller argues that the\r\nexistence of these _ready‐made materials of speech_ is a proof that man\r\ncannot be the crown of a long organic series. This _potentiality of\r\nforming roots_ is the great crux which Materialists almost invariably\r\navoid.\r\n\r\nVon Hartmann explains it as a manifestation of the “Unconscious,” and\r\nadmits its cogency _versus_ mechanical Atheism. Hartmann is a fair\r\nrepresentative of the Metaphysician and Idealist of the present age.\r\n\r\nThe argument has never been met by the non‐pantheistic Evolutionists. To\r\nsay with Schmidt: “Forsooth we are to halt before the origin of\r\nlanguage!”—is an avowal of dogmatism and of speedy defeat.(1581)\r\n\r\nWe respect those men of Science who, wise in their generation, say: The\r\nPrehistoric Past being utterly beyond our powers of direct observation, we\r\nare too honest, too devoted to the truth—or what we regard as truth—to\r\nspeculate upon the unknown, giving out our unproven theories along with\r\nfacts absolutely established in Modern Science.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The borderland of [metaphysical] knowledge is, therefore, best\r\n    left to time, which is the best test as to truth.(1582)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a wise and an honest sentence in the mouth of a Materialist. But\r\nwhen a Hæckel, after just saying that “historical events of past time,”\r\nhaving “occurred many millions of years ago,(1583) ... are for ever\r\nremoved from direct observation,” and that neither Geology nor\r\nPhylogeny(1584) can or will “rise to the position of a real ‘exact’\r\nscience,” then insists on the development of all organisms—“from the\r\nlowest vertebrate to the highest, from amphioxus to man”—we ask for a\r\nweightier proof than he can give. Mere “empirical sources of knowledge,”\r\nso extolled by the author of _Anthropogeny_—when he has to be satisfied\r\nwith the qualification for his own views—are not competent to settle\r\nproblems lying beyond their domain; nor is it the province of exact\r\nScience to place any reliance on them.(1585) If “empirical”—and Hæckel\r\nhimself declares so repeatedly—then they are no better, nor any more\r\nreliable, in the sight of _exact_ research, when extended into the remote\r\npast, than are our Occult teachings of the East, both having to be placed\r\non the same level. Nor are his phylogenetic and palingenetic speculations\r\ntreated any more favourably by the real Scientists, than are our cyclic\r\nrepetitions of the evolution of the great in the minor races, and the\r\noriginal order of Evolution. For the province of exact, real Science,\r\nmaterialistic though it be, is to carefully avoid anything like guess‐\r\nwork, speculation which _cannot_ be verified; in short, all _suppressio\r\nveri_ and all _suggestio falsi_. The business of the men of exact Science\r\nis to observe, each in his chosen department, the phenomena of Nature; to\r\nrecord, tabulate, compare and classify the facts, down to the smallest\r\nminutiæ which are presented to the observation of the senses _with the\r\nhelp of all the exquisite mechanism that modern invention supplies_, not\r\nby the aid of metaphysical flights of fancy. All that he has a legitimate\r\nright to do, is to correct by the assistance of physical instruments the\r\ndefects or illusions of his own coarser vision, auditory powers, and other\r\nsenses. He has no right to trespass on the grounds of Metaphysics and\r\nPsychology. His duty is to verify and to rectify all the facts that _fall\r\nunder his direct observation_; to profit by the experiences and mistakes\r\nof the Past in endeavouring to trace the working of a certain\r\nconcatenation of cause and effect, which—but only by its constant and\r\nunvarying repetition—may be called a Law. This it is which a man of\r\nScience is expected to do, if he would become a teacher of men and remain\r\ntrue to his original programme of natural or physical Sciences. Any side\r\npath from this royal road becomes speculation.\r\n\r\nInstead of keeping to this, what does many a so‐called man of Science do\r\nin these days? He rushes into the domain of pure Metaphysics, while\r\nderiding them. He delights in rash conclusions and calls them “a deductive\r\nlaw from the inductive law” of a theory based upon and drawn out of the\r\ndepths of his own consciousness—that consciousness being perverted by, and\r\nhoneycombed with, one‐sided Materialism. He attempts to explain the\r\n“origin” of things, which are yet embosomed only in his own conceptions.\r\nHe attacks spiritual beliefs and religious traditions millenniums old, and\r\ndenounces everything, save his own hobbies, as superstition. He suggests\r\ntheories of the Universe, a cosmogony developed by blind, mechanical\r\nforces of Nature alone, far more _miraculous and impossible_ than even one\r\nbased upon the assumption of _fiat lux ex nihilo_—and tries to astonish\r\nthe world by his wild theory; and this theory, being known to emanate from\r\na scientific brain, is taken, on _blind faith_, as very scientific and as\r\nthe outcome of Science.\r\n\r\nAre these the opponents Occultism should dread? Most decidedly not. For\r\nsuch theories are treated no better by _real_ Science than are our own by\r\nempirical Science. Hæckel, hurt in his vanity by du Bois‐Reymond, is never\r\ntired of publicly complaining of the latter’s onslaught on his fantastic\r\ntheory of descent. Rhapsodizing on “the exceedingly rich storehouse of\r\nempirical evidence,” he calls those “recognized Physiologists” who oppose\r\nevery speculation of his drawn from the said “storehouse”—ignorant men,\r\nand declares:\r\n\r\n\r\n    If many men, and among them even some Scientists of repute—hold\r\n    that the whole of phylogeny is a castle in the air, and\r\n    genealogical trees [from monkeys?] are empty plays of phantasy,\r\n    they only in speaking thus demonstrate their ignorance of that\r\n    wealth of _empirical sources of knowledge_ to which reference has\r\n    already been made.(1586)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe open Webster’s Dictionary and read the definitions of the word\r\n“empirical”:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Depending upon experience or observation alone, _without due\r\n    regard to modern science and theory_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis applies to the Occultists, Spiritualists, Mystics, etc. Again:\r\n\r\n\r\n    An empiric; one who confines himself to applying the results of\r\n    his own observations only [which is Hæckel’s case]; one _wanting\r\n    science_ ... an ignorant and unlicensed practitioner; a quack; a\r\n    charlatan.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo Occultist or “Magician,” has ever been treated to any worse epithets.\r\nYet the Occultist remains on his own metaphysical grounds, and does not\r\nendeavour to rank _his knowledge_, the fruits of _his_ personal\r\nobservation and experience, among the _exact_ Sciences of modern learning.\r\nHe keeps within his legitimate sphere, where he is master. But what is one\r\nto think of a rank Materialist, whose duty is clearly traced before him,\r\nwho uses such an expression as this:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The origin of man from other mammals, and most directly from the\r\n    catarrhine ape, is a deductive law, that follows necessarily from\r\n    the inductive law of the Theory of Descent.(1587)\r\n\r\n\r\nA “theory” is simply a hypothesis, a speculation, and _not_ a law. To say\r\notherwise is one of the many liberties taken now‐a‐days by Scientists.\r\nThey enunciate an absurdity, and then hide it behind the shield of\r\nScience. A deduction from theoretical speculation is nothing more than a\r\n_speculation on a speculation_. Sir William Hamilton has already shown\r\nthat the word theory is now used\r\n\r\n\r\n    In a very loose and improper sense ... that it is convertible into\r\n    _hypothesis_, and _hypothesis_ is commonly used as another term\r\n    for _conjecture_, whereas the terms “theory” and “theoretical” are\r\n    properly used in opposition to the terms practice and practical.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Modern Science puts an extinguisher on the latter statement, and mocks\r\nat the idea. Materialistic Philosophers and Idealists of Europe and\r\nAmerica may be agreed with the Evolutionists as to the physical origin of\r\nman, yet it will never become a general truth with the true Metaphysician;\r\nand the latter defies the Materialists to make good their arbitrary\r\nassumptions. That the ape‐theory theme(1588) of Vogt and Darwin, on which\r\nthe Huxley‐Hæckelians have of late composed such extraordinary variations,\r\nis far less scientific—because clashing with the fundamental laws of that\r\ntheme itself—than ours can ever be shown to be, is very easy of\r\ndemonstration. Let the reader only turn to the excellent work on _Human\r\nSpecies_ by the great French Naturalist de Quatrefages, and our statement\r\nwill at once be verified.\r\n\r\nMoreover, between the Esoteric teaching concerning the Origin of Man and\r\nDarwin’s speculations, no man, unless he is a rank Materialist, will\r\nhesitate. This is the description given by Mr. Darwin of “the early\r\nprogenitors of man.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    They must have been once covered with hair, both sexes having\r\n    beards; their ears were probably pointed and capable of movement;\r\n    and their bodies were provided with a tail, having the proper\r\n    muscles. Their limbs and bodies were also acted on by many muscles\r\n    which now only occasionally reäppear, but are normally present in\r\n    the Quadrumana.... The foot was then prehensile, judging from the\r\n    condition of the great toe in the fœtus; and our progenitors, no\r\n    doubt, were arboreal in their habits, and frequented some warm\r\n    forest‐clad land. The males had great canine teeth, which served\r\n    them as formidable weapons.(1589)\r\n\r\n\r\nDarwin connects man with the type of the tailed catarrhines:\r\n\r\n\r\n    And consequently removes him a stage backward in the scale of\r\n    evolution. The English naturalist is not satisfied to take his\r\n    stand upon the ground of his own doctrines, and, like Hæckel, on\r\n    this point places himself in direct variance with one of the\r\n    fundamental laws which constitute the principal charm of\r\n    Darwinism.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then the learned French Naturalist proceeds to show how this\r\nfundamental law is broken. He says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In fact, in the theory of Darwin, transmutations do not take\r\n    place, either by chance or in every direction. They are ruled by\r\n    certain laws which are due to the organization itself. If an\r\n    organism is once modified in a given direction, it can undergo\r\n    secondary or tertiary transmutations, but will still preserve the\r\n    impress of the original. It is the law of _permanent\r\n    characterization_, which _alone_ permits Darwin to explain the\r\n    filiation of groups, their characteristics, and their numerous\r\n    relations. It is by virtue of this law that _all_ the descendants\r\n    of the first mollusc have been molluscs; _all_ the descendants of\r\n    the first vertebrate have been vertebrates. It is clear that this\r\n    constitutes one of the foundations of the doctrine. It follows\r\n    that two beings belonging to two distinct types can be referred to\r\n    _a common ancestor_, but the one cannot be the descendant of the\r\n    other.\r\n\r\n    Now man and apes present a very striking contrast in _respect to\r\n    type_. Their organs ... correspond almost exactly term for term:\r\n    but these organs are arranged after a very different plan. In man\r\n    they are so arranged that he is essentially a _walker_, while in\r\n    apes they necessitate his being a _climber_.... There is here an\r\n    anatomical and mechanical distinction.... A glance at the page\r\n    where Huxley has figured side by side a human skeleton and the\r\n    skeletons of the most highly developed apes is a sufficiently\r\n    convincing proof.\r\n\r\n    The consequence of these facts, from the point of view of the\r\n    logical application of the law of _permanent characterizations_,\r\n    is that man cannot be descended from an ancestor who is already\r\n    characterized as an ape, any more than a catarrhine tailless ape\r\n    can be descended from a tailed catarrhine. A _walking animal_\r\n    cannot be descended from a _climbing_ one. This was clearly\r\n    understood by Vogt.\r\n\r\n    In placing man among the primates, he declares without hesitation\r\n    that the lowest class of apes have passed the landmark (the common\r\n    ancestor), from which the different types of this family have\r\n    originated and diverged. [This ancestor of the apes, Occult\r\n    Science sees in the lowest human group during the Atlantean\r\n    period, as shown before.] We must, then, place the origin of man\r\n    beyond the last ape [corroborating our doctrine], if we wish to\r\n    adhere to one of the laws most emphatically necessary to the\r\n    Darwinian theory. We then come to the prosimiæ of Hæckel, the\r\n    loris, indris, etc. But these animals also are climbers; we must\r\n    go further, therefore, in search of our first direct ancestor. But\r\n    the genealogy by Hæckel brings us from the latter to the\r\n    _marsupials_. From men to the kangaroo the distance is certainly\r\n    great. Now neither living nor extinct fauna show the intermediate\r\n    types which ought to serve as landmarks. This difficulty causes\r\n    but slight embarrassment to Darwin.(1590) We know that he\r\n    considers the want of information upon similar questions as a\r\n    proof in his favour. Hæckel doubtless is as little embarrassed. He\r\n    admits the existence of an absolutely theoretical _pithecoid man_.\r\n\r\n    Thus, since it has been proved that, according to Darwinism\r\n    itself, the origin of man must be placed beyond the eighteenth\r\n    stage, and since it becomes, in consequence, _necessary_ to fill\r\n    up the gap between marsupials and man, will Hæckel admit the\r\n    existence of _four unknown intermediate groups_ instead of one?\r\n    Will he complete his genealogy in this manner? It is not for me to\r\n    answer.(1591)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut see Hæckel’s famous genealogy, in _The Pedigree of Man_, called by him\r\nthe “Ancestral Series of Man.” In the “Second Division” (eighteenth stage)\r\nhe describes—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Prosimiæ, allied to the Loris (Stenops) and Makis (Lemur), without\r\n    marsupial bones and cloaca, _with placenta_.(1592)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now turn to de Quatrefages’ _The Human Species_,(1593) and see his\r\nproofs, based on the latest discoveries, to show that the Prosimiæ of\r\nHæckel have no decidua and a diffuse placenta. They cannot be the\r\nancestors of the apes even, let alone man, according to a fundamental law\r\nof Darwin himself, as the great French Naturalist shows. But this does not\r\ndismay the “animal theorists” in the least, for self‐contradiction and\r\nparadoxes are the very soul of modern Darwinism. Witness—Mr. Huxley;\r\nhaving himself shown, with regard to fossil man and the “missing link,”\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Neither in Quaternary ages nor at the present time does any\r\n    intermediary being fill the gap which separates man from the\r\n    Troglodyte;\r\n\r\n\r\nand that to “deny the existence of this gap _would be as reprehensible as\r\nabsurd_,” the great man of Science denies his own words _in actu_ by\r\nsupporting with all the weight of his scientific authority that _most_\r\n“absurd” of all theories—the _descent of man from an ape_!\r\n\r\nSays de Quatrefages:\r\n\r\n\r\n    This genealogy is wrong throughout, and is founded on a material\r\n    error.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndeed, Hæckel bases his descent of man on the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\nstages, the Marsupialia and Prosimiæ—(genus Hæckelii?). Applying the\r\nlatter term to the Lemuridæ—hence making of them animals with a\r\nplacenta—he commits a zoological blunder. For after having himself divided\r\nmammals according to their anatomical differences into two groups—the\r\n_indeciduata_, which have no decidua (or special membrane uniting the\r\nplacentæ), and the _deciduata_, those who possess it—he includes the\r\nProsimiæ in the latter group. Now we have shown elsewhere what other men\r\nof Science had to say to this. As de Quatrefages says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The anatomical investigations of ... Milne Edwards and Grandidier\r\n    upon the animals ... place it beyond all doubt that the Prosimiæ\r\n    of Hæckel have no decidua and a diffuse placenta. They are\r\n    _indeciduata_. Far from any possibility of their being the\r\n    ancestors of the apes, according to the principles laid down by\r\n    Hæckel himself, they cannot even be regarded as the ancestors of\r\n    the zonoplacental mammals ... and ought to be connected with the\r\n    Pachydermata, the Edentata, and the Cetacea.(1594)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd yet Hæckel’s inventions pass with some as _exact Science_!\r\n\r\nThe above mistake, if indeed it be one, is not even hinted at in Hæckel’s\r\n_Pedigree of Man_, translated by Aveling. If the excuse may stand good\r\nthat at the time the famous “genealogies” were made, “the embryogenesis of\r\nthe Prosimiæ was not known,” it is familiar now. We shall see whether the\r\nnext edition of Aveling’s translation will have this important error\r\nrectified, or if the seventeenth and eighteenth stages will remain as they\r\nare to blind the profane, as one of the _real_ intermediate links. But, as\r\nthe French Naturalist observes:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Their [Darwin’s and Hæckel’s] process is always the same,\r\n    considering the unknown as a _proof_ in favour of their theory.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt comes to this. Grant to man an immortal Spirit and Soul; endow the\r\nwhole animate and inanimate creation with the monadic principle gradually\r\nevolving from latent and passive into active and positive polarity—and\r\nHæckel will not have a leg to stand upon, whatever his admirers may say.\r\n\r\nBut there are important divergencies even between Darwin and Hæckel. While\r\nthe former makes us proceed from the _tailed_ catarrhine, Hæckel traces\r\nour hypothetical ancestor to the _tailless_ ape, though, at the same time,\r\nhe places him in a hypothetical “stage” immediately preceding\r\nthis—Menocerca with tails (nineteenth stage).\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we have one thing in common with the Darwinian school, that\r\nis the law of gradual and extremely slow Evolution, embracing many million\r\nyears. The chief quarrel, it appears, is with regard to the nature of the\r\nprimitive “ancestor.” We shall be told that the Dhyân Chohan, or the\r\n“progenitor” of Manu, is a hypothetical being unknown on _the physical\r\nplane_. We reply that it was believed in by the whole of Antiquity, and is\r\nby nine‐tenths of the present humanity; whereas not only is the pithecoid\r\nman, or ape‐man, a purely hypothetical creature of Hæckel’s creation,\r\nunknown and untraceable on this Earth, but further its genealogy—as\r\ninvented by him—clashes with scientific facts and all the known data of\r\nmodern discovery in Zoology. It is simply absurd, even as a fiction. As de\r\nQuatrefages demonstrates in a few words, Hæckel “admits the existence of\r\nan absolutely theoretical pithecoid man”—a hundred times more difficult to\r\naccept than any Deva ancestor. And it is not the only instance in which he\r\nproceeds in a similar manner in order to complete his genealogical table.\r\nIn fact he very naïvely admits his inventions himself. Does he not confess\r\nthe non‐existence of his Sozura (fourteenth stage)—a creature entirely\r\nunknown to Science—by confessing over his own signature, that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The proof of its existence arises from the necessity of an\r\n    intermediate type between the thirteenth and the fourteenth\r\n    stages[!].\r\n\r\n\r\nIf so, we might maintain with as much scientific right, that the proof of\r\nthe existence of our three ethereal Races, and of the three‐eyed men of\r\nthe Third and Fourth Root‐Races, “arises also from the necessity of an\r\nintermediate type” between the animal and the Gods. What reason would the\r\nHæckelians have to protest in this special case?\r\n\r\nOf course there is a ready answer: Because we do not grant the presence of\r\nthe Monadic Essence. The manifestation of the Logos as individual\r\nconsciousness in the animal and human creation is not accepted by exact\r\nScience, nor does it cover the whole ground, of course. But the failures\r\nof Science and its arbitrary assumptions are far greater on the whole than\r\nany “extravagant” Esoteric doctrine can ever furnish.(1595) Even thinkers\r\nof the school of Von Hartmann have become tainted with the general\r\nepidemic. They accept the Darwinian Anthropology (more or less), though\r\nthey also postulate the individual Ego as a manifestation of the\r\nUnconscious (the Western presentation of the Logos or Primeval Divine\r\nThought). They say the evolution of the physical man is from the animal,\r\nbut that mind in its various phases is altogether a thing apart from\r\nmaterial facts, though organism, as a Upâdhi, is necessary for its\r\nmanifestation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlastidular Souls, And Conscious Nerve‐Cells.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut one can never see the end of such wonders with Hæckel and his school,\r\nwhom the Occultists and Theosophists have every right to consider as\r\nmaterialistic tramps trespassing on private metaphysical grounds. Not\r\nsatisfied with the paternity of Bathybius (Hæckelii), “plastidular souls”\r\nand “atom‐souls”(1596) are now invented, on the basis of purely blind\r\nmechanical forces of matter. We are informed that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The study of the evolution of soul‐life shows us that this has\r\n    worked its way up from the lower stages of the simple cell‐soul,\r\n    through an astonishing series of gradual stages in evolution, up\r\n    to the soul of man.(1597)\r\n\r\n\r\n“Astonishing,” truly—based as this wild speculation is on the\r\n_consciousness_ of the “nerve cells.” For as he tells us:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Little as we are in a position, at the present time, to explain\r\n    fully the nature of consciousness,(1598) yet the comparative and\r\n    genetic observation of it clearly shows, that it is only a higher\r\n    and more complex function of the nerve cells.(1599)\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Herbert Spencer’s song on consciousness—is sung, it seems, and may\r\nhenceforth be safely stored up in the lumber room of obsolete\r\nspeculations. Where, however, do Hæckel’s “complex functions” of _his_\r\nscientific “nerve‐cells” land him? Once more right into the Occult and\r\nmystic teachings of the _Kabalah_ about the descent of Souls as conscious\r\nand unconscious Atoms; among the Pythagorean Monad and the Monads of\r\nLeibnitz, and the “Gods, Monads, and Atoms” of our Esoteric\r\nteaching;(1600) into the _dead letter_ of Occult teachings, left to the\r\n_amateur_ Kabalists and professors of ceremonial Magic. For this is what\r\nhe says, in explaining his newly‐coined terminology:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Plastidule‐Souls. The plastidules or protoplasmic molecules, the\r\n    smallest, homogeneous parts of the protoplasm are, on our plastid\r\n    theory, to be regarded as the active factors of all life‐\r\n    functions. The plastidular soul differs from the inorganic\r\n    molecular soul in that it possesses memory.(1601)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis he develops in his mirific lecture on the “Perigenesis of Plastidule,\r\nor the Wave‐motions of Living Particles.” It is an improvement on Darwin’s\r\ntheory of “Pangenesis,” and a further approach, a cautious move, towards\r\n“Magic.” The former is a conjecture that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Some of the actual identical atoms which formed part of ancestral\r\n    bodies are thus transmitted through their descendants for\r\n    generation after generation, so that we are literally “flesh of\r\n    the flesh” of the primeval creature who has developed into man\r\n\r\n\r\n—explains the author of _A Modern Zoroastrian_.(1602) The latter,\r\nOccultism, teaches that—(_a_) the life‐atoms of our (Prâna) Life‐\r\nPrinciple, are never entirely lost when a man dies. That the atoms best\r\nimpregnated with the Life‐Principle, an independent, eternal, conscious\r\nfactor, are partially transmitted from father to son by heredity, and are\r\npartially drawn once more together and become the animating principle of\r\nthe new body in every new incarnation of the Monads. Because (_b_), as the\r\nIndividual Soul is ever the same, so are the atoms of the lower principles\r\n(the body, its astral, or life‐double, etc.), drawn as they are by\r\naffinity and Karmic law always to the same individuality in a series of\r\nvarious bodies.(1603)\r\n\r\nTo be just and, to say the least, logical, our modern Hæckelians ought to\r\npass a resolution that henceforth the “Perigenesis of the Plastidule,” and\r\nother similar lectures, should be bound up with those on “Esoteric\r\nBuddhism” and “The Seven Principles in Man.” Thus the public will have a\r\nchance, at any rate, of comparing the two teachings and then of judging\r\nwhich is the more or the less absurd, even from the standpoint of\r\nmaterialistic and exact Science.\r\n\r\nNow the Occultists, who trace every atom in the Universe, whether an\r\naggregate or single, to One Unity, the Universal Life; who do not\r\nrecognize that anything in Nature can be inorganic; who know of no such\r\nthing as dead Matter—the Occultists are consistent with their doctrine of\r\nSpirit and Soul when speaking of memory in every atom, of will and\r\nsensation. But what can a Materialist mean by the qualification? The law\r\nof biogenesis, in the sense applied to it by the Hæckelians, is the result\r\nof the ignorance on the part of the man of Science of _Occult_ Physics. We\r\nknow and speak of “life‐atoms,” and of “sleeping‐atoms,” because we regard\r\nthese two forms of energy—the kinetic and the potential—as produced by one\r\nand the same force, or the One Life, and regard the latter as the source\r\nand mover of all. But what is it that furnished with energy, and\r\nespecially with memory, the “plastidular souls” of Hæckel? The “wave\r\nmotion of living particles” becomes comprehensible on the theory of a\r\nSpiritual One Life, of a universal Vital Principle independent of _our_\r\nMatter, and manifesting as atomic energy only on _our_ plane of\r\nconsciousness. It is that which, individualized in the human cycle, is\r\ntransmitted from father to son.\r\n\r\nNow Hæckel, modifying Darwin’s theory, suggests “more plausibly,” as the\r\nauthor of _A Modern Zoroastrian_ thinks:\r\n\r\n\r\n    That not the identical atoms, but their peculiar motions and mode\r\n    of aggregation have been thus transmitted [by heredity].(1604)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Hæckel, or any other Scientist, knew more than any of them does know of\r\nthe nature of the atom, he would not have improved the occasion in this\r\nway. For he only states, in more metaphysical language than Darwin, one\r\nand the same thing. The Life‐Principle, or Life Energy, which is\r\nomnipresent, eternal, indestructible, is a Force and a Principle as\r\n_noumenon_, while it is Atoms, as _phenomenon_. It is one and the same\r\nthing, and cannot be considered as separate except in Materialism.(1605)\r\n\r\nFurther, Hæckel enunciates concerning the Atom‐Souls that which, at first\r\nsight, appears as occult as the Monad of Leibnitz:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The recent contest as to the nature of atoms, which we must regard\r\n    as in some form or other the ultimate factors in all physical and\r\n    chemical processes, seems to be capable of easiest settlement by\r\n    the conception that these very minute masses possess, as centres\r\n    of force, a persistent soul, that every atom has sensation and the\r\n    power of movement.(1606)\r\n\r\n\r\nHe does not say a word concerning the fact that this is Leibnitz’ theory,\r\nand one that is preëminently Occult. Nor does he understand the term\r\n“soul” as we do; for, with Hæckel it is simply, along with consciousness,\r\nthe product of the grey matter of the brain, a thing which, as the cell‐\r\nsoul\r\n\r\n\r\n    Is as indissolubly bound up with the protoplasmic body as is the\r\n    human soul with the brain and spinal cord.(1607)\r\n\r\n\r\nHe rejects the conclusions of Kant, Herbert Spencer, of du Bois‐Reymond\r\nand Tyndall. The latter expresses the opinion of all the great men of\r\nScience, as of the greatest thinkers of this and past ages, in saying\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The passage from the physics of the brain to the corresponding\r\n    facts of consciousness is unthinkable. Were our minds and senses\r\n    so ... illuminated as to enable us to see and feel the very\r\n    molecules of the brain; were we capable of following all their\r\n    motions, all their groupings ... electric discharges ... we should\r\n    be as far as ever from the solution of the problem.... The chasm\r\n    between the two classes of phenomena would still remain\r\n    intellectually impassable.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the complex function of the nerve‐cells of the great German Empiric,\r\nor, in other words, his consciousness, will not permit him to follow the\r\nconclusions of the greatest thinkers of our globe. _He is greater than\r\nthey._ He asserts this, and _protests_ against all:\r\n\r\n\r\n    No one has the right to hold that in the future we shall not be\r\n    able to pass beyond these limits of our knowledge that to‐day seem\r\n    impassable.(1608)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd he quotes from Darwin’s introduction to _The Descent of Man_ the\r\nfollowing words, which he modestly applies to his scientific opponents and\r\nhimself:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is always those who know little, and not those who know much,\r\n    that positively affirm that this or that problem will never be\r\n    solved by Science.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe world may rest satisfied. The day is not far off when the “thrice\r\ngreat” Hæckel will have shown, to his own satisfaction, that the\r\nconsciousness of Sir Isaac Newton was, physiologically speaking, but the\r\nreflex action (or _minus_ consciousness) caused by the perigenesis of the\r\nplastidules of our common ancestor and old friend, the Moneron Hæckelii.\r\nThough, the said Bathybius has been found out and exposed as a pretender\r\nsimulating the organic substance _it is not_, and though among the\r\nchildren of men, Lot’s wife alone—and even this, only after her\r\ndisagreeable metamorphosis—could claim as her forefather the pinch of salt\r\n_it is_; all this will not dismay him in the least. He will go on\r\nasserting, as coolly as he has always done, that it was only the peculiar\r\nmode and motion of the ghost of the long‐vanished atoms of our Father\r\nBathybius, which—transmitted across æons of time into the cell‐tissue of\r\nthe grey matter of the brains of every great man—caused Sophocles and\r\nÆschylus, and Shakspere as well, to write their tragedies, Newton, his\r\n_Principia_, Humboldt, his _Cosmos_, etc. It also prompted Hæckel to\r\ninvent Græco‐Latin names three inches long, pretending to mean a good\r\ndeal, and meaning—nothing.\r\n\r\nOf course we are quite aware that the true, honest Evolutionist agrees\r\nwith us; and that he is the first to say that not only is the geological\r\nrecord imperfect, but that there are enormous gaps in the series of\r\nhitherto discovered fossils, which can never be filled. He will tell us,\r\nmoreover, that “no Evolutionist assumes that man is descended from any\r\nexisting ape or any extinct ape either,” but that man and apes originated\r\n_probably_ æons back, in some common root stock. Still, as de Quatrefages\r\npoints out, he will urge as an evidence corroborating his claim this\r\nwealth of absent proofs as well, saying that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    All living forms have not been preserved in the fossil series, the\r\n    chances of preservation being few and far between ... [even\r\n    primitive man] burying or burning his dead.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is just what we ourselves claim. It is just as _possible_ that the\r\nfuture may have in store for us the discovery of the giant skeleton of an\r\nAtlantean, thirty feet high, as of the fossil of a pithecoid “missing\r\nlink”; only the former is more _probable_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection III. The Fossil Relics of Man and the Anthropoid Ape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Geological Facts Bearing On The Question Of Their Relationship.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe data derived from scientific research as to “primeval man” and the ape\r\nlend no countenance to theories deriving the former from the latter.\r\n“Where, then, must we look for primeval man?”—still queries Mr. Huxley,\r\nafter having vainly searched for him in the very depths of the Quaternary\r\nstrata.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Was the oldest Homo sapiens Pliocene or Miocene, or yet more\r\n    ancient? In still older strata do the fossilized bones of an ape\r\n    more anthropoid, or a man more pithecoid than any yet known, await\r\n    the researches of some unborn palæontologist? Time will\r\n    show.(1609)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will—undeniably—and thus vindicate the Anthropology of the Occultists.\r\nMeanwhile, in his eagerness to vindicate Mr. Darwin’s _Descent of Man_,\r\nMr. Boyd Dawkins believes that he has all but found the “missing link”—in\r\ntheory. It was due to Theologians more than to Geologists that, till\r\nnearly 1860, man had been considered as a relic no older than the Adamic\r\northodox 6,000 years. As Karma would have it, though, it was left to a\r\nFrench Abbé—Bourgeois—to give this easy‐going theory even a worse blow\r\nthan had been given to it by the discoveries of Boucher de Perthes.\r\nEveryone knows that the Abbé discovered and brought to light good evidence\r\nthat man was already in existence during the Miocene period, for flints of\r\nundeniably human making were excavated from Miocene strata. In the words\r\nof the author of _Modern Science and Modern Thought_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    They must either have been chipped by man, or, as Mr. Boyd Dawkins\r\n    supposes, by the dryopithecus or some other anthropoid ape which\r\n    had a dose of intelligence so much superior to the gorilla or\r\n    chimpanzee, as to be able to fabricate tools. But in this case the\r\n    problem would be solved and the missing link discovered, for such\r\n    an ape might well have been the ancestor of Palæolithic man.(1610)\r\n\r\n\r\nOr—_the descendant of Eocene man_, which is a variant offered to the\r\ntheory. Meanwhile, the dryopithecus with such fine mental endowments is\r\nyet to be discovered. On the other hand, Neolithic and even Palæolithic\r\nman having become an absolute certainty, and as the same author justly\r\nobserves:\r\n\r\n\r\n    If 100,000,000 years have elapsed since the earth became\r\n    sufficiently solidified to support vegetable and animal life, the\r\n    Tertiary period may have lasted for 5,000,000; or for 10,000,000\r\n    years, if the life‐sustaining order of things has lasted, as Lyell\r\n    supposes for at least 200,000,000 years—(1611)\r\n\r\n\r\nwhy should not another theory be tried? Let us carry man, as a hypothesis,\r\nto the close of Mesozoic times—admitting _argumenti causâ_ that the (much\r\nmore recent) higher apes then existed! This would allow ample time for man\r\nand the modern apes to have diverged from the mythical “ape more\r\nanthropoid,” and even for the latter to have degenerated into those that\r\nare found _mimicking_ man in using “branches of trees as clubs, and\r\ncracking cocoa‐nuts with hammer and stones.”(1612) Some savage tribes of\r\nhillmen in India build their abodes on trees, just as the gorillas build\r\ntheir dens. The question, which of the two, the beast or the man, has\r\nbecome the imitator of the other, is scarcely an open one, even granting\r\nMr. Boyd Dawkins’ theory. The fanciful character of this hypothesis, is,\r\nhowever, generally admitted. It is argued that while in the Pliocene and\r\nMiocene periods there were true apes and baboons, and man was undeniably\r\ncontemporaneous with the former of these times—though, as we see, orthodox\r\nAnthropology still hesitates, in the teeth of facts, to place him in the\r\nera of the dryopithecus, which latter—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Has been considered by some anatomists as in some respects\r\n    superior to the chimpanzee or the gorilla ... (1613)\r\n\r\n\r\nyet, in the Eocene there have been no other fossil _primates_ unearthed\r\nand no pithecoid stocks found save a few extinct lemurian forms. And we\r\nfind it also hinted that the dryopithecus _may have been_ the “missing\r\nlink,” though the brain of the creature no more warrants the theory than\r\ndoes the brain of the modern gorilla. (See also Gaudry’s speculations.)\r\n\r\nNow we would ask who among the Scientists is ready to prove that _there\r\nwas no man_ in existence in the early Tertiary period? What is it that\r\nprevented his presence? Hardly thirty years ago his existence any farther\r\nback than six or seven thousand years was indignantly denied. Now he is\r\nrefused admission into the Eocene age. Next century it may become a\r\nquestion whether man was not contemporary with the “flying dragon,” the\r\npterodactyl, the plesiosaurus and iguanodon, etc. Let us listen, however,\r\nto the echo of Science.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Now, wherever anthropoid apes lived it is clear that, whether as a\r\n    question of anatomical structure, or of climate and surroundings,\r\n    man, or some creature which was the ancestor of man, might have\r\n    lived also. Anatomically speaking, apes and monkeys are as much\r\n    special variations of the mammalian type as man, whom they\r\n    resemble bone for bone, and muscle for muscle, and the physical\r\n    animal man is simply an instance of the quadrumanous type\r\n    specialized for erect posture and a larger brain(1614).... If he\r\n    could survive, as we know he did, the adverse conditions and\r\n    extreme vicissitudes of the Glacial period, there is no reason why\r\n    he might not have lived in the semi‐tropical climate of the\r\n    Miocene period, when a genial climate extended even to Greenland\r\n    and Spitzbergen.(1615)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen most of the men of Science who are uncompromising in their belief in\r\nthe descent of man from an “extinct anthropoid mammal;” will not accept\r\neven the bare tenability of any other theory than an ancestor common to\r\nman and the dryopithecus, it is refreshing to find in a work of real\r\nscientific value such a margin for compromise. Indeed, it is as wide as it\r\ncan be made under the circumstances, _i.e._, without immediate danger of\r\ngetting knocked off one’s feet by the tidal wave of science‐adulation.\r\nBelieving that the difficulty of accounting—\r\n\r\n\r\n    For the development of intellect and morality by evolution is not\r\n    so great as that presented by the difference as to physical\r\n    structure(1616) between man and the highest animal—\r\n\r\n\r\nthe same author says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    But it is not so easy to see how this difference of physical\r\n    structure arose, and how a being came into existence which had\r\n    such a brain and hand, and such undeveloped capabilities for an\r\n    almost unlimited progress. The difficulty is this: the difference\r\n    in structure between the lowest existing race of man and the\r\n    highest existing ape is too great to admit of the possibility of\r\n    one being the direct descendant of the other. The negro in some\r\n    respects makes a slight approximation towards the Simian type. His\r\n    skull is narrower, his brain less capacious, his muzzle more\r\n    projecting, his arm longer than those of the average European man.\r\n    Still he is essentially a man, and separated by a wide gulf from\r\n    the chimpanzee or the gorilla. Even the idiot or crétin, whose\r\n    brain is no larger and intelligence no greater than that of the\r\n    chimpanzee, is an arrested man, not an ape.\r\n\r\n    If, therefore, the Darwinian theory holds good in the case of man\r\n    and ape, we must go back to some common ancestor from whom both\r\n    may have originated.... But to establish this as a _fact_ and not\r\n    a _theory_ we require to find that ancestral form, or, at any\r\n    rate, some intermediate forms tending towards it ... in other\r\n    words ... the “missing link.” Now it must be admitted that,\r\n    hitherto, not only have no such missing links been discovered, but\r\n    the oldest known human skulls and skeletons which date from the\r\n    Glacial period, and are probably at least 100,000 years old, show\r\n    no very decided approximation towards any such pre‐human type. On\r\n    the contrary, one of the oldest types, that of the men of the\r\n    sepulchral cave of Cro‐Magnon,(1617) is that of a fine race, tall\r\n    in stature, large in brain, and on the whole superior to many of\r\n    the existing races of mankind. The reply of course is that the\r\n    time is insufficient, and if man and the ape had a common\r\n    ancestor, that as a highly developed anthropoid ape, certainly,\r\n    and man, probably, already existed in the Miocene period, such\r\n    ancestor must be sought still further back at a distance compared\r\n    with which the whole Quaternary period sinks into\r\n    insignificance.... All this is true, and it may well make us\r\n    hesitate before we admit that man ... is alone an exception to the\r\n    general law of the universe, and is the creature of a special\r\n    creation. This is the more difficult to believe, as the ape family\r\n    which man so closely resembles [?] in physical structure contains\r\n    numerous branches which graduate into one another, but the\r\n    extremes of which differ more widely than man does from the\r\n    highest of the ape series. If a special creation is required for\r\n    man, must there not have been special creations for the\r\n    chimpanzee, the gorilla, the orang, and for at least 100 different\r\n    species of apes and monkeys which are all built on the same\r\n    lines?(1618)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere _was_ a “special creation” for man, and a “special creation” for the\r\nape, _his_ progeny; only on other lines than ever bargained for by\r\nScience. Albert Gaudry and others give some weighty reasons why man cannot\r\nbe regarded as the crown of an ape‐stock. When one finds that not only was\r\nthe “primeval savage” (?) a reality in the Miocene times, but that, as de\r\nMortillet shows, the flint relics he has left behind him were splintered\r\n_by fire_ in that remote epoch; when we learn that the dryopithecus,\r\n_alone of the anthropoids_, appears in those strata, what is the natural\r\ninference? That the Darwinians are in a quandary. The very man‐like gibbon\r\nis _still in the same low grade of development, as it was when it\r\ncoëxisted with man at the close of the Glacial period_. It has not\r\nappreciably altered since the Pliocene times. Now there is little to\r\nchoose between the dryopithecus and the existing anthropoids—gibbon,\r\ngorilla, etc. If, then, the Darwinian theory is all‐sufficient, how are we\r\nto “explain” the evolution of this ape into man during the first half of\r\nthe Miocene? The time is far too short for such a theoretical\r\ntransformation. The extreme slowness with which variation in species\r\nsupervenes renders the thing inconceivable—more especially on the “natural\r\nselection” hypothesis. The enormous mental and structural gulf between a\r\nsavage acquainted with fire and the mode of kindling it, and a brutal\r\nanthropoid, is too great to bridge even in idea, during so contracted a\r\nperiod. Let the Evolutionists push back the process into the preceding\r\nEocene, if they prefer to do so; let them even trace both man and\r\ndryopithecus to a common ancestor; the unpleasant consideration has,\r\nnevertheless, to be faced that in Eocene strata the anthropoid fossils are\r\nas conspicuous by their absence, as is the fabulous pithecanthropus of\r\nHæckel. Is an exit out of this _cul de sac_ to be found by an appeal to\r\nthe “unknown,” and a reference, with Darwin, to the “imperfection of the\r\ngeological record”? So be it; but the same right of appeal must then be\r\nequally accorded to the Occultists, instead of remaining the monopoly of\r\npuzzled Materialism. Physical man, we say, existed before the first bed of\r\nthe Cretaceous rocks was deposited. In the early part of the Tertiary age,\r\nthe most brilliant civilization the world has ever known flourished at a\r\nperiod when the Hæckelian man‐ape is conceived as roaming through primeval\r\nforests, and Mr. Grant Allen’s putative ancestor as swinging himself from\r\nbough to bough with his hairy mates, the degenerated Liliths of the Third\r\nRace Adam. Yet there were no anthropoid apes in the brighter days of the\r\ncivilization of the Fourth Race; but Karma is a mysterious law, and no\r\nrespecter of persons. The monsters bred in sin and shame by the Atlantean\r\nGiants, “blurred copies” of their bestial sires, and hence of modern man,\r\naccording to Huxley, now mislead and overwhelm with error the speculative\r\nAnthropologist of European Science.\r\n\r\nWhere did the first men live? Some Darwinists say in Western Africa, some\r\nin Southern Asia, others again believe in an independent origin of human\r\nstocks in Asia and America from a simian ancestry. Hæckel, however,\r\nadvances gaily to the charge. Starting from his prosimia, “the ancestor\r\ncommon to all other catarrhini including man”—a “link” now, however,\r\ndisposed of for good by recent anatomical discoveries—he endeavours to\r\nfind a habitat for the primeval pithecanthropus alalus.\r\n\r\n\r\n    In all probability it [the transformation of animal into man]\r\n    occurred in Southern Asia, in which region many evidences are\r\n    forthcoming that here was the original home of the different\r\n    species of man. Probably Southern Asia itself was not the earliest\r\n    cradle of the human race, but Lemuria, a continent that lay to the\r\n    south of Asia, and sank later on beneath the surface of the Indian\r\n    Ocean. The period during which the evolution of the anthropoid\r\n    apes into ape‐like men took place was probably the last part of\r\n    the Tertiary period, the Pliocene age, and perhaps the Miocene\r\n    age, its forerunner.(1619)\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the above speculations, the only one of any worth is that referring to\r\nLemuria, which _was_ the cradle of mankind—of the physical sexual creature\r\nwho materialized through long æons out of the ethereal hermaphrodites.\r\nOnly, if it is proved that Easter Island is an actual relic of Lemuria, we\r\nmust believe that according to Hæckel the “dumb ape‐men,” just removed\r\nfrom a brutal mammalian monster, built the gigantic portrait‐statues, two\r\nof which are now in the British Museum. Critics are mistaken in terming\r\nHæckelian doctrines “abominable, revolutionary, immoral”—though\r\nMaterialism is the legitimate outcome of the ape‐ancestor myth—they are\r\nsimply too absurd to demand disproof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Western Evolutionism: The Comparative Anatomy Of Man And The Anthropoid\r\nIn No Way A Confirmation Of Darwinism.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are told that while every other heresy against Modern Science may be\r\ndisregarded, this, our denial of the Darwinian theory as applied to man,\r\nwill be the one “unpardonable” sin. The Evolutionists stand firm as rock\r\non the evidence of similarity of structure between the ape and man. The\r\nanatomical evidence, it is urged, is quite overpowering in this case; it\r\nis bone for bone, and muscle for muscle, even the brain conformation being\r\nvery much the same.\r\n\r\nWell, what of that? All this was known before King Herod; and the writers\r\nof the _Râmâyana_, the poets who sang the prowess and valour of Hanumân,\r\nthe Monkey‐God, “whose feats were great and wisdom never rivalled,” must\r\nhave known as much about his anatomy and brain as does any Hæckel or\r\nHuxley in our modern day. Volumes upon volumes have been written upon this\r\nsimilarity, in antiquity as in more modern times. Therefore, there is\r\nnothing new given to the world or to philosophy in such volumes as\r\nMivart’s _Man and Apes_, or Messrs. Fiske and Huxley’s defence of\r\nDarwinism. But what are those crucial proofs of man’s descent from a\r\npithecoid ancestor? If the Darwinian theory is not the true one, we are\r\ntold, if man and ape do not descend from a common ancestor, then we must\r\nexplain the reason of:\r\n\r\n(i) The similarity of structure between the two; the fact that the higher\r\nanimal world—man and beast—is physically of one type or pattern.\r\n\r\n(ii) The presence of rudimentary organs in man, _i.e._, traces of former\r\norgans now atrophied by disuse. Some of these organs, it is asserted,\r\ncould not have had any scope for employment, except in a semi‐animal,\r\nsemi‐arboreal monster. Why, again, do we find in man those “rudimentary”\r\norgans—as useless as its rudimentary wing is to the apteryx of\r\nAustralia—the vermiform appendix of the cæcum, the ear muscles,(1620) the\r\n“rudimentary tail” with which children are still sometimes born, etc.?\r\n\r\nSuch is the war cry; and the cackle of the smaller fry among the\r\nDarwinians is louder, if possible, than even that of the scientific\r\nEvolutionists themselves!\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the latter—with their great leader Mr. Huxley, and such\r\neminent Zoologists as Mr. Romanes and others—while defending the Darwinian\r\ntheory, are the first to confess the almost insuperable difficulties in\r\nthe way of its final demonstration. And there are as great men of Science\r\nas the above‐named, who deny, most emphatically, the uncalled‐for\r\nassumption, and loudly denounce the unwarrantable exaggerations on the\r\nquestion of this supposed similarity. It is sufficient to glance at the\r\nworks of Broca, Gratiolet, Owen, Pruner‐Bey, and finally at the last great\r\nwork of de Quatrefages, _Introduction à __ l’Étude des Races Humaines,\r\nQuestions Générales_, to discover the fallacy of the Evolutionists. We may\r\nsay more: the exaggerations concerning this alleged similarity of\r\nstructure between man and the anthropomorphous ape have become so glaring\r\nand absurd of late, that even Mr. Huxley has found himself forced to\r\nprotest against the too sanguine expectations. It was that great Anatomist\r\npersonally who called the “smaller fry” to order, by declaring in one of\r\nhis articles that the differences between the structure of the human body\r\nand that of the highest anthropomorphous pithecoid, were not only _far\r\nfrom being trifling and unimportant_, but were, on the contrary, very\r\ngreat and suggestive:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Every bone of a gorilla bears marks by which it might be\r\n    distinguished from the corresponding bone of a man.(1621)\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the existing creatures there is not one single intermediate form\r\nthat could fill the gap between man and the ape. To ignore that gap, he\r\nadded, “would be no less wrong than absurd.”\r\n\r\nFinally, the absurdity of such an _unnatural_ descent of man is so\r\npalpable in the face of all the proofs and evidence as to the skull of the\r\npithecoid compared to that of man, that de Quatrefages resorted\r\nunconsciously to our Esoteric theory by saying that it is rather the apes\r\nthat can claim descent from man than _vice versâ_. As proven by Gratiolet,\r\nwith regard to the cavities of the brain of the anthropoids—in which\r\nspecies that organ develops in an inverse ratio to what would be the case\r\nwere the corresponding organs in man really the product of the development\r\nof the said organs in the apes—the size of the human skull and its brain,\r\nas well as the cavities, increase with the individual development of man.\r\nHis intellect develops and increases with age, while his facial bones and\r\njaws diminish and straighten, thus becoming more and more spiritualized;\r\nwhereas with the ape it is the reverse. In its youth the anthropoid is far\r\nmore intelligent and good‐natured, while with age it becomes duller; and,\r\nas its skull recedes and seems to diminish as it grows, its facial bones\r\nand jaws develop, the brain being finally crushed, and thrown entirely\r\nback, to make with every day more room for the animal type. The organ of\r\nthought—the brain—recedes and diminishes, entirely conquered and replaced\r\nby that of the wild beast—the jaw apparatus.\r\n\r\nThus, as wittily remarked in the French work, a gorilla could with perfect\r\njustice address an Evolutionist, claiming its right of descent from him.\r\nIt would say to him: We, anthropoid apes, form a retrogressive departure\r\nfrom the human type, and therefore our development and evolution are\r\nexpressed by a transition from a human‐like to an animal‐like structure of\r\norganism; but in what way could _you_, men, descend from us—how can you\r\nform a continuation of our genus? For, to make this possible, your\r\norganization would have to differ still more than ours does from the human\r\nstructure, it would have to approach still closer to that of the beast\r\nthan ours does; and in such a case justice demands that you should give up\r\nto us your place in nature. You are lower than we are, once that you\r\ninsist on tracing your genealogy from our kind; for the structure of our\r\norganization and its development are such that we are unable to generate\r\nforms of a higher organization than our own.\r\n\r\nThis is where the Occult Sciences agree entirely with de Quatrefages.\r\nOwing to the very type of his development man cannot _descend_ from either\r\nan ape or an ancestor common to both apes and men, but shows his origin to\r\nbe from a type far superior to himself. And this type is the “Heavenly\r\nMan”—the Dhyân Chohans, or the Pitris so‐called, as shown in the first\r\nPart of this Volume. On the other hand, the pithecoids, the orang‐outang,\r\nthe gorilla, and the chimpanzee _can_, and, as the Occult Sciences teach,\r\n_do_, descend from the animalized Fourth human Root‐Race, being the\r\nproduct of man and an extinct species of mammal—whose remote ancestors\r\nwere themselves the product of Lemurian bestiality—which lived in the\r\nMiocene age. The ancestry of this semi‐human monster is explained in the\r\nStanzas as originating in the sin of the “mind‐less” races of the middle\r\nThird Race period.\r\n\r\nWhen it is borne in mind that all forms which now people the Earth are so\r\nmany variations on _basic types_ originally thrown off by the Man of the\r\nThird and Fourth Round, such an evolutionist argument as that insisting on\r\nthe “unity of structural plan” characterizing all vertebrates, loses its\r\nedge. The basic types referred to were very few in number in comparison\r\nwith the multitude of organisms to which they ultimately gave rise; but a\r\ngeneral unity of type has, nevertheless, been preserved throughout the\r\nages. The economy of Nature does not sanction the coëxistence of several\r\nutterly opposed “ground plans” of organic evolution on one planet. Once,\r\nhowever, that the general drift of the Occult explanation is formulated,\r\ninference as to detail may well be left to the intuitive reader.\r\n\r\nSimilarly with the important question of the “rudimentary” organs\r\ndiscovered by Anatomists in the human organism. Doubtless this line of\r\nargument, when wielded by Darwin and Hæckel against their European\r\nadversaries, proved of great weight. Anthropologists, who ventured to\r\ndispute the derivation of man from an animal ancestry, were sorely puzzled\r\nhow to deal with the presence of gill‐clefts, with the “tail” problem, and\r\nso on. Here again Occultism comes to our assistance with the necessary\r\ndata.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that, as previously stated, the human type is the repertory of\r\nall potential organic forms, and the central point from which these latter\r\nradiate. In this postulate we find a true “evolution” or “unfolding”—in a\r\nsense which cannot be said to belong to the mechanical theory of Natural\r\nSelection. Criticizing Darwin’s inference from “rudiments,” an able writer\r\nremarks:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Why is it not just as probably a true hypothesis to suppose that\r\n    man was first created with these rudimentary sketches in his\r\n    organization, and that they became useful appendages in the lower\r\n    animals into which man degenerated, as it is to suppose that these\r\n    parts existed in full development, activity and practical use, in\r\n    the lower animals out of whom man was generated?(1622)\r\n\r\n\r\nRead for “into which man degenerated,” “the prototypes which man _shed_ in\r\nthe course of his astral developments,” and an aspect of the true Esoteric\r\nsolution is before us. But a wider generalization is now to be formulated.\r\n\r\nSo far as our present Fourth Round terrestrial period is concerned, the\r\nmammalian fauna are alone to be regarded as traceable to prototypes shed\r\nby Man. The amphibia, birds, reptiles, fishes, etc., are the resultants of\r\nthe Third Round, astral fossil forms stored up in the auric envelope of\r\nthe Earth and projected into physical objectivity subsequent to the\r\ndeposition of the first Laurentian rocks. “Evolution” has to deal with the\r\nprogressive modifications, which Palæontology shows to have affected the\r\nlower animal and vegetable kingdoms in the course of geological time. It\r\ndoes not, and from the nature of things cannot, touch on the subject of\r\nthe pre‐physical types which served as the basis for future\r\ndifferentiation. Tabulate the general laws controlling the development of\r\nphysical organisms it certainly may, and to a certain extent it has\r\nacquitted itself ably of the task.\r\n\r\nTo return to the immediate subject of discussion. The mammalia, whose\r\nfirst traces are discovered in the marsupials of the Triassic rocks of the\r\nSecondary period, were evolved from _purely_ astral progenitors\r\ncontemporary with the Second Race. They are thus _post‐human_, and,\r\nconsequently, it is easy to account for the general resemblance between\r\ntheir embryonic stages and those of Man, who necessarily embraces in\r\nhimself and epitomizes in his development the features of the group he\r\noriginated. This explanation disposes of a portion of the Darwinist brief.\r\n\r\n\r\n    But how to account for the presence of the gill‐clefts in the\r\n    human fœtus, which represent the stage through which the branchiæ\r\n    of the fish are developed;(1623) for the pulsating vessel\r\n    corresponding to the heart of the lower fishes, which constitutes\r\n    the fœtal heart; for the entire analogy presented by the\r\n    segmentation of the human ovum, the formation of the blastoderm,\r\n    and the appearance of the “gastrula” stage, with corresponding\r\n    stages in lower vertebrate life and even among the sponges; for\r\n    the various types of lower animal life which the form of the\r\n    future child shadows forth in the cycle of its growth?... How\r\n    comes it to pass that stages in the life of fishes, whose\r\n    ancestors swam [æons before the epoch of the First Root‐Race] in\r\n    the seas of the Silurian period, as well as stages in that of the\r\n    later amphibian, reptilian fauna, are mirrored in the “epitomized\r\n    history” of human fœtal development?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis plausible objection is met by the reply that the Third Round\r\nterrestrial animal forms were just as much referable to types thrown off\r\nby Third Round Man, as that new importation into our planet’s area—the\r\nmammalian stock—is to the Fourth Round Humanity of the Second Root‐Race.\r\nThe process of human fœtal growth epitomizes not only the general\r\ncharacteristics of the Fourth, but of the Third Round terrestrial life.\r\nThe diapason of type is run through in brief. Occultists are thus at no\r\nloss to “account for” the birth of children with an actual caudal\r\nappendage, or for the fact that the tail in the human fœtus is, at one\r\nperiod, double the length of the nascent legs. The potentiality of every\r\norgan useful to animal life is locked up in Man—the Microcosm of the\r\nMacrocosm—and abnormal conditions may not unfrequently result in the\r\nstrange phenomena which Darwinists regard as “reversion to ancestral\r\nfeatures.”(1624) Reversion, indeed, but scarcely in the sense contemplated\r\nby our present‐day empiricists!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC. Darwinism And The Antiquity Of Man: The Anthropoids And Their Ancestry.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe public has been notified by more than one eminent modern Geologist and\r\nman of Science, that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    All estimate of geological duration is not merely imperfect, but\r\n    necessarily impossible; for we are ignorant of the causes, though\r\n    they must have existed, which quickened or retarded the progress\r\n    of the sedimentary deposits.(1625)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now another man of Science, as well known (Croll) calculating that the\r\nTertiary age began either fifteen or two‐and‐a‐half million years ago—the\r\nformer being a more correct calculation, according to Esoteric Doctrine,\r\nthan the latter—there seems in this case, at least, no very great\r\ndisagreement. Exact Science, refusing to see in man a “special creation”\r\n(to a certain degree the Secret Sciences do the same), is at liberty to\r\nignore the first three, or rather two‐and‐a‐half Races—the spiritual, the\r\nsemi‐astral, and the semi‐human—of our teachings. But it can hardly do the\r\nsame in the case of the Third, at its closing period, the Fourth, and the\r\nFifth Races, since it already divides mankind into Palæolithic and\r\nNeolithic man.(1626) The Geologists of France place man in the Mid‐Miocene\r\nage (Gabriel de Mortillet), and some even in the Secondary period, as de\r\nQuatrefages suggests; while the English _savants_ do not generally accept\r\nsuch antiquity for their species. But they may know better some day. For,\r\nas says Sir Charles Lyell:\r\n\r\n\r\n    If we consider the absence or extreme scarcity of human bones and\r\n    works of art in all strata, whether marine or fresh‐water, even in\r\n    those formed in the immediate proximity of land inhabited by\r\n    millions of human beings, we shall be prepared for the general\r\n    dearth of human memorials in glacial formations, whether recent,\r\n    pleistocene, or of more ancient date. If there were a few\r\n    wanderers over lands covered with glaciers, or over seas infested\r\n    with icebergs, and if a few of them left their bones or weapons in\r\n    moraines or in marine drifts, the chances, after the lapse of\r\n    thousands of years, of a geologist meeting with one of them must\r\n    be infinitesimally small.(1627)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe men of Science avoid pinning themselves down to any definite statement\r\nconcerning the age of man, as indeed they are hardly able to make any, and\r\nthus leave enormous latitude to bolder speculations. Nevertheless, while\r\nthe majority of the Anthropologists carry back the existence of man _only_\r\ninto the period of the post‐glacial drift, or what is called the\r\nQuaternary period, those of them who, as Evolutionists, trace man to a\r\ncommon origin with the monkey, do not show great consistency in their\r\nspeculations. The Darwinian hypothesis demands, in reality, a far greater\r\nantiquity for man, than is even dimly suspected by superficial thinkers.\r\nThis is proven by the greatest authorities on the question—Mr. Huxley, for\r\ninstance. Those, therefore, who accept the Darwinian evolution, _ipso\r\nfacto_ hold very tenaciously to an antiquity of man so very great, indeed,\r\nthat it falls not so far short of the Occultist’s estimate.(1628) The\r\nmodest thousands of years of the _Encyclopædia Britannica_ and the 100,000\r\nyears, to which Anthropology in general limits the age of Humanity, seem\r\nquite microscopical when compared with the figures implied in Mr. Huxley’s\r\nbold speculations. The former, indeed, makes of the original race of men\r\nape‐like cave‐dwellers. The great English Biologist, in his desire to\r\nprove man’s pithecoid origin, insists that the transformation of the\r\nprimordial ape into a human being must have occurred _millions of years\r\nback_. For in criticizing the excellent cranial capacity of the\r\nNeanderthal skull, notwithstanding his assertion that it is overlaid with\r\n“pithecoid bony walls,” coupled with Mr. Grant Allen’s assurances that\r\nthis skull—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Possesses large bosses on the forehead, strikingly [?] suggestive\r\n    of those which give the gorilla its peculiarly fierce\r\n    appearance(1629)—\r\n\r\n\r\nstill Mr. Huxley is forced to admit that, in the said skull, his theory is\r\nonce more defeated by the—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Completely human proportions of the accompanying limb‐bones,\r\n    together with the fair development of the Engis skull.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn consequence of all this we are notified that these skulls—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Clearly indicate that the first traces of the primordial stock\r\n    whence man has proceeded, need no longer be sought by those who\r\n    entertain any form of the doctrine of progressive development in\r\n    the newest Tertiaries; but that they may be looked for in an epoch\r\n    more distant from the age of the elephas primigenius than that is\r\n    from us.(1630)\r\n\r\n\r\nAn _untold_ antiquity for man is thus, then, the scientific _sine quâ non_\r\nin the question of Darwinian Evolution, since the oldest Palæolithic man\r\nshows as yet no appreciable differentiation from his modern descendant. It\r\nis only of late that Modern Science has with every year begun to widen the\r\nabyss that now separates her from ancient Science, as that of Pliny and\r\nHippocrates; none of the old writers would have derided the Archaic\r\nTeachings with respect to the evolution of the human races and animal\r\nspecies, as the present day Scientist—Geologist or Anthropologist—is sure\r\nto do.\r\n\r\nThe pendulum of thought oscillates between extremes. Having now finally\r\nemancipated herself from the shackles of Theology, Science has embraced\r\nthe opposite fallacy; and in the attempt to interpret Nature on purely\r\nmaterialistic lines, she has built up that most extravagant theory of the\r\nages—the derivation of man from a ferocious and brutal ape. So rooted has\r\nthis doctrine now become, in one form and another, that the most Herculean\r\nefforts will be needed to bring about its final rejection. The Darwinian\r\nAnthropology is the incubus of the Ethnologist, a sturdy child of modern\r\nMaterialism, which has grown up and acquired increasing vigour, as the\r\nineptitude of the theological legend of Man’s “creation” became more and\r\nmore apparent. It has thriven on account of the strange delusion that—as a\r\nScientist of repute puts it:\r\n\r\n\r\n    All hypotheses and theories with respect to the rise of man can be\r\n    reduced to two [the evolutionist and the biblical exoteric\r\n    account].... There is no other hypothesis conceivable [!!].\r\n\r\n\r\nThe anthropology of the Secret Volumes is, however, the best possible\r\nanswer to such a worthless contention.\r\n\r\nThe anatomical resemblance between man and the higher ape, so frequently\r\ncited by Darwinists as pointing to some former ancestor common to both,\r\npresents an interesting problem, the proper solution of which is to be\r\nsought for in the Esoteric explanation of the genesis of the pithecoid\r\nstocks. We have given it as far as it was useful, by stating that the\r\nbestiality of the primeval mindless races resulted in the production of\r\nhuge man‐like monsters—the offspring of human and animal parents. As time\r\nrolled on, and the still semi‐astral forms consolidated into the physical,\r\nthe descendants of these creatures were modified by external conditions,\r\nuntil the breed, dwindling in size, culminated in the lower apes of the\r\nMiocene period. With these the later Atlanteans renewed the sin of the\r\n“Mindless”—this time with full responsibility. The resultants of their\r\ncrime were the apes now known as anthropoid.\r\n\r\nIt may be useful to compare this very simple theory—and we are willing to\r\noffer it merely as a hypothesis to the unbelievers—with the Darwinian\r\nscheme, so full of insurmountable obstacles, that no sooner is one of them\r\novercome by a more or less ingenious hypothesis, than ten worse\r\ndifficulties are forthwith discovered behind the one disposed of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection IV. Duration of the Geological Periods, Race Cycles, and the\r\nAntiquity of Man.\r\n\r\n\r\nMillions of years have sunk into Lethe, leaving no more recollection in\r\nthe memory of the profane than the few millenniums of the orthodox Western\r\nchronology as to the Origin of Man and the history of the primeval races.\r\n\r\nAll depends on the proofs found for the antiquity of the Human Race. If\r\nthe still‐debated man of the Pliocene or even the Miocene period was the\r\nHomo primigenius, then Science _may_ be right (_argumenti causâ_) in\r\nbasing its present Anthropology—as to the date and mode of origin of Homo\r\nsapiens—on the Darwinian theory.(1631) But if the skeletons of man should\r\nat any time be discovered in the Eocene strata, while no fossil ape is\r\nfound there, and the existence of man is thus proved to be prior to that\r\nof the anthropoid—then Darwinians will have to exercise their ingenuity in\r\nanother direction. Moreover, it is said in well‐informed quarters that the\r\ntwentieth century will be still in its earliest teens when such undeniable\r\nproof of man’s priority will be forthcoming.\r\n\r\nEven now much evidence is being brought forward to prove that the dates\r\nhitherto assigned for the foundations of cities, civilizations and various\r\nother historical events have been absurdly curtailed. This was done as a\r\npeace‐offering to biblical chronology. The well‐known Palæontologist Ed.\r\nLartet writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n    No date is to be found in Genesis, which assigns a time for the\r\n    birth of primitive humanity.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Chronologists have for fifteen centuries endeavoured to force the\r\n_Bible_ facts into agreement with their systems. Thus, no less than one\r\nhundred and forty different opinions have been formed about the single\r\ndate of “Creation.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    And between the extreme variations there is a discrepancy of 3,194\r\n    years, in the reckoning of the period between the beginning of the\r\n    world and the birth of Christ. Within the last few years,\r\n    archæologists have had also to throw back by nearly 3,000 years\r\n    the beginnings of Babylonian civilization. On the foundation\r\n    cylinder deposited by Nabonidus, the Babylonian king, conquered by\r\n    Cyrus—are found the records of the former, in which he speaks of\r\n    his discovery of the foundation stone that belonged to the\r\n    original temple built by Naram‐Sin, son of Sargon, of Accadia, the\r\n    conqueror of Babylonia, who, says Nabonidus, lived 3,200 years\r\n    before his own time.(1632)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have shown in _Isis Unveiled_ that those who based history on the\r\nchronology of the Jews—a race which had none of its own and rejected the\r\nWestern till the twelfth century—would lose their way, for the Jewish\r\naccount could only be followed through kabalistic computation, and only\r\nthen with key in hand. We characterized the late George Smith’s chronology\r\nof the Chaldæans and Assyrians, which he had made to fit in with that of\r\nMoses, as quite fantastic. And now, in this respect at least, later\r\nAssyriologists have corroborated our denial. For, whereas George Smith\r\nmakes Sargon I (the prototype of Moses) reign in the city of Akkad about\r\n1600 B.C.—probably out of a latent respect for Moses, whom the _Bible_\r\nmakes to flourish 1571 B.C.—we now learn from the first of the six Hibbert\r\nLectures delivered by Professor A. H. Sayce, of Oxford, in 1887, that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Old views of the early annals of Babylonia and its religions have\r\n    been much modified by recent discovery. The first Semitic Empire,\r\n    it is now agreed, was that of Sargon of Accad, who established a\r\n    great library, patronized literature, and extended his conquests\r\n    across the sea into Cyprus. It is now known that he reigned as\r\n    early as B.C. 3,750.... The Accadian monuments found by the French\r\n    at Tel‐loh must be even older, reaching back to about B.C. 4,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn other words, to the fourth year of the World’s creation agreeably with\r\n_Bible_ chronology, and when Adam was in his swaddling clothes. Perchance,\r\nin a few years more, the 4,000 years may be further extended. The well‐\r\nknown Oxford lecturer remarked in his disquisitions upon “The Origin and\r\nGrowth of Religion as Illustrated by the Religion of the Ancient\r\nBabylonians,” that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The difficulties of systematically tracing the origin and history\r\n    of the Babylonian Religion were considerable. The sources of our\r\n    knowledge of the subject were almost wholly monumental, very\r\n    little help being obtainable from classical or Oriental writers.\r\n    Indeed, it was an undeniable fact that the Babylonian priesthood\r\n    intentionally swaddled up the study of the religious texts in\r\n    coils of almost insuperable difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat they have confused the dates, and especially the order of events\r\n“intentionally,” is undeniable, and for a very good reason: their writings\r\nand records were all Esoteric. The Babylonian priests did no more than the\r\npriests of other ancient nations. Their records were meant only for the\r\nInitiates and their disciples, and it is only the latter who were\r\nfurnished with the keys to the true meaning. But Professor Sayce’s remarks\r\nare promising. For he explains the difficulty by saying that as:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Nineveh library contained mostly copies of older Babylonian\r\n    texts, and the copyists pitched upon such tablets only as were of\r\n    special interest to the Assyrian conquerors, belonging to a\r\n    comparatively late epoch, this added much to the greatest of all\r\n    our difficulties—namely, our being so often left in the dark as to\r\n    the age of our documentary evidence, and the precise worth of our\r\n    materials for history.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus one has a right to infer that some still fresher discovery may lead\r\nto a new necessity for pushing the Babylonian dates so far beyond the year\r\n4,000 B.C., as to make them _pre‐cosmic_ in the judgment of every _Bible_\r\nworshipper.\r\n\r\nHow much more would Palæontology have learned had not millions of works\r\nbeen destroyed! We talk of the Alexandrian Library, which has been thrice\r\ndestroyed, namely, by Julius Cæsar 48 B.C., in A.D. 390, and lastly in the\r\nyear A.D. 640 by the general of Kaliph Omar. What is this in comparison\r\nwith the works and records destroyed in the primitive Atlantean Libraries,\r\nwherein records are said to have been traced on the tanned skins of\r\ngigantic antediluvian monsters? Or again in comparison with the\r\ndestruction of the countless Chinese books by command of the founder of\r\nthe Imperial Tsin dynasty, Tsin Shi Hwang‐ti, in 213 B.C.? Surely the\r\nbrick‐clay tablets of the Imperial Babylonian Library, and the priceless\r\ntreasures of the Chinese collections, could never have contained such\r\ninformation as one of the aforesaid “Atlantean” skins would have furnished\r\nto the ignorant world.\r\n\r\nBut even with the extremely meagre data at hand, Science has been able to\r\nsee the necessity of throwing back nearly every Babylonian date, and has\r\ndone so quite generously. We learn from Professor Sayce that even the\r\narchaic statues at Tel‐loh, in Lower Babylonia, have suddenly been\r\nassigned a date contemporary with the fourth dynasty in Egypt.(1633)\r\nUnfortunately, dynasties and pyramids share the fate of geological\r\nperiods; their dates are arbitrary, and depend on the whims of the\r\nrespective men of Science. Archæologists know now, it is said, that the\r\nafore‐mentioned statues are fashioned out of green diorite, that can only\r\nbe got in the Peninsula of Sinai; and\r\n\r\n\r\n    They accord in the style of art, and in the standard of\r\n    measurement employed, with the similar diorite statues of the\r\n    pyramid builders of the third and fourth Egyptian dynasties....\r\n    Moreover, the only possible period for a Babylonian occupation of\r\n    the Sinaitic quarries must be placed shortly after the close of\r\n    the epoch at which the pyramids were built; and thus only can we\r\n    understand how the name of Sinai could have been derived from that\r\n    of Sin, the primitive Babylonian moon‐god.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is very logical, but what is the date fixed for these dynasties?\r\nSanchuniathon’s and Manetho’s synchronistic tables—or whatever remained of\r\nthese after holy Eusebius had the handling of them—have been rejected; and\r\nstill we have to remain satisfied with the four or five thousand years\r\nB.C., so liberally allotted to Egypt. At all events one point is gained.\r\nThere is, at last, a city on the face of the Earth which is allowed, at\r\nleast, 6,000 years, and it is Eridu. Geology has discovered it. According\r\nto Professor Sayce again:\r\n\r\n\r\n    They are now also able to obtain time for the silting up of the\r\n    head of the Persian Gulf, which demands a lapse of between 5,000\r\n    and 6,000 years since the period when Eridu, now twenty‐five miles\r\n    inland, was the seaport at the mouth of the Euphrates, and the\r\n    seat of Babylonian commerce with Southern Arabia and India. More\r\n    than all, the new chronology gives time for the long series of\r\n    eclipses recorded in the great astronomical work called “The\r\n    Observations of Bel”; and we are also enabled to understand the\r\n    otherwise perplexing change in the position of the vernal equinox,\r\n    which has occurred since our present zodiacal signs were named by\r\n    the earliest Babylonian astronomers. When the Accadian calendar\r\n    was arranged and the Accadian months were named, the sun at the\r\n    vernal equinox was not, as now, in Pisces, or even in Aries, but\r\n    in Taurus. The rate of the precession of the equinoxes being\r\n    known, we learn that at the vernal equinox the sun was in Taurus\r\n    from about 4,700 years B.C., and we thus obtain astronomical\r\n    limits of date which cannot be impugned.(1634)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may make our position plainer if we state at once that we use Sir C.\r\nLyell’s nomenclature for the ages and periods, and that when we talk of\r\nthe Secondary and Tertiary age, of the Eocene, Miocene and Pliocene\r\nperiods—this is simply to make our facts more comprehensible. Since these\r\nages and periods have not yet been allowed fixed and determined durations,\r\ntwo‐and‐a‐half and fifteen million years being assigned at different times\r\nto one and the same age (the Tertiary); and since no two Geologists or\r\nNaturalists seem to agree on this point—Esoteric Teachings may remain\r\nquite indifferent to the appearance of man in the Secondary or the\r\nTertiary age. If the latter age may be allowed even so much as fifteen\r\nmillion years’ duration—well and good; for the Occult Doctrine, jealously\r\nguarding its real and correct figures so far as concerns the First,\r\nSecond, and two‐thirds of the Third Root‐Race, gives clear information\r\nupon one point only—the age of Vaivasvata Manu’s humanity.(1635)\r\n\r\nAnother definite statement is that during the so‐called Eocene period the\r\nContinent to which the Fourth Race belonged, and on which it lived and\r\nperished, showed the first symptoms of sinking, and that it was in the\r\nMiocene age that it was finally destroyed—save the small island mentioned\r\nby Plato. These points have now to be checked by scientific data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Modern Scientific Speculations About The Ages Of The Globe, Animal\r\nEvolution, And Man.\r\n\r\n\r\nMay we not be permitted to throw a glance at the works of specialists? The\r\nwork on _World‐Life: Comparative Geology_, by Prof. A. Winchell, furnishes\r\nus with curious data. Here we find an opponent of the nebular theory\r\nsmiting with all the force of the hammer of his _odium theologicum_ on the\r\nrather contradictory hypotheses of the great stars of Science, in the\r\nmatter of sidereal and cosmic phenomena based on their respective\r\nrelations to terrestrial durations. The “too imaginative physicists and\r\nnaturalists” do not fare very easily under this shower of their own\r\nspeculative computations placed side by side, and cut rather a sorry\r\nfigure. Thus he writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Sir William Thompson, on the basis of the observed principles of\r\n    cooling, concludes that no more than 10 million years [elsewhere\r\n    he makes it 100,000,000] can have elapsed since the temperature of\r\n    the earth was sufficiently reduced to sustain vegetable\r\n    life.(1636) Helmholz calculates that 20 million years would\r\n    suffice for the original nebula to condense to the present\r\n    dimensions of the sun. Prof. S. Newcomb requires only 10 millions\r\n    to attain a temperature of 212° Fahr.(1637) Croll estimates 70\r\n    million years for the diffusion of the heat....(1638) Bischof\r\n    calculates that 350 million years would be required for the earth\r\n    to cool from a temperature of 2,000° to 200° Centigrade. Reade,\r\n    basing his estimate on observed rates of denudation, demands 500\r\n    million years since sedimentation began in Europe.(1639) Lyell\r\n    ventured a rough guess of 240 million years; Darwin thought 300\r\n    million years demanded by the organic transformations which his\r\n    theory contemplates, and Huxley is disposed to demand 1,000\r\n    millions [!!].... Some biologists ... seem to close their eyes\r\n    tight and leap at one bound into the abyss of millions of years,\r\n    of which they have no more adequate estimate than of\r\n    infinity.(1640)\r\n\r\n\r\nThen he proceeds to give what he takes to be more correct geological\r\nfigures: a few will suffice.\r\n\r\nAccording to Sir William Thompson “the whole incrusted age of the world is\r\n80,000,000 years”; and agreeably with Prof. Houghton’s calculations of a\r\nminimum limit for the time since the elevation of Europe and Asia, three\r\nhypothetical ages for three _possible_ and different modes of upheaval are\r\ngiven, varying from the modest figure of 640,730 years, through 4,170,000\r\nyears to the tremendous figure of 27,491,000 years!!\r\n\r\nThis is enough, as one can see, to cover our claims for the four\r\nContinents and even the figures of the Brâhmans.\r\n\r\nFurther calculations, the details of which the reader may find in Prof.\r\nWinchell’s work,(1641) bring Houghton to an approximation of the\r\nsedimentary age of the globe—11,700,000 years. These figures are found too\r\nsmall by the author, who forthwith extends them to 37,000,000 years.\r\n\r\nAgain, according to Croll,(1642) 2,500,000 years “represents the time\r\nsince the beginning of the Tertiary age” in one work; and according to\r\nanother modification of his view, 15,000,000 only have elapsed since the\r\nbeginning of the Eocene period,(1643) this, being the first of the three\r\nTertiary periods, leaves the student suspended between two‐and‐a‐half and\r\nfifteen millions. But if one has to hold to the former moderate figures,\r\nthen the whole incrusted age of the world would be 131,600,000\r\nyears.(1644)\r\n\r\nAs the last Glacial period extended from 240,000 to 80,000 years ago\r\n(Prof. Croll’s view), therefore, man must have appeared on Earth from\r\n100,000 to 120,000 years ago. But, as says Prof. Winchell with reference\r\nto the antiquity of the Mediterranean race:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is generally believed to have made its appearance during the\r\n    later decline of the continental glaciers. It does not concern,\r\n    however, the antiquity of the Black and Brown races, since there\r\n    are numerous evidences of their existence in more southern\r\n    regions, in times remotely pre‐glacial.(1645)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a specimen of geological _certainty_ and _agreement_, these figures\r\nalso may be added. Three authorities—Messrs. T. Belt, F.G.S., Robert Hunt,\r\nF.R.S., and J. Croll, F.R.S.,—in estimating the time that has elapsed\r\nsince the Glacial epoch, give figures that vary to an almost incredible\r\nextent:\r\n\r\nBelt:         20,000 years.\r\nHunt:         80,000 years\r\nCroll:       240,000 years(1646)\r\n\r\nNo wonder that Mr. Pengelly confesses that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is at present and perhaps always will be impossible to reduce,\r\n    even approximately, geological time into years or even into\r\n    millenniums.\r\n\r\n\r\nA wise word of advice from the Occultists to the gentlemen Geologists;\r\nthey ought to imitate the cautious example of Masons. As chronology, they\r\nsay, cannot measure the era of the creation, therefore, their “Antient and\r\nPrimitive Rite” uses 000,000,000 as the nearest approach to reality.\r\n\r\nThe same uncertainty, contradictions and disagreement reign on all other\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nThe scientific authorities on the Descent of Man are again, for all\r\npractical purposes, a delusion and a snare. There are many Anti‐Darwinists\r\nin the British Association, and Natural Selection begins to lose ground.\r\nThough at one time the saviour, which seemed to rescue the learned\r\ntheorists from a final intellectual collapse into the abyss of fruitless\r\nhypothesis, it begins to be distrusted. Even Mr. Huxley is showing signs\r\nof truancy, and thinks “natural selection _not the sole_ factor”:\r\n\r\nWe greatly suspect that she [Nature] does make considerable jumps in the\r\nway of variation now and then, and that these saltations give rise to some\r\nof the gaps which appear to exist in the series of known forms.(1647)\r\n\r\nAgain, C. R. Bree, M.D., argues in this wise in considering the fatal gaps\r\nin Mr. Darwin’s theory:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It must be again called to mind that the intermediate forms must\r\n    have been vast in numbers.... Mr. St. George Mivart believes that\r\n    change in evolution may occur more quickly than is generally\r\n    believed; but Mr. Darwin sticks manfully to his belief, and again\r\n    tells us “_natura non facit saltum_.”(1648)\r\n\r\n\r\nHerein the Occultists are at one with Mr. Darwin.\r\n\r\nEsoteric teaching fully corroborates the idea of Nature’s slowness and\r\ndignified progression. “Planetary impulses” are all periodical. Yet this\r\nDarwinian theory, correct as it is in minor particulars, agrees no more\r\nwith Occultism than with Mr. Wallace, who, in his _Contributions to the\r\nTheory of Natural Selection_, shows pretty conclusively that something\r\n_more_ than Natural Selection is requisite to produce physical man.\r\n\r\nLet us, meanwhile, examine the _scientific_ objections to this scientific\r\ntheory, and see what they are.\r\n\r\nMr. St. George Mivart is found arguing that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It will be a moderate computation to allow 25,000,000 for the\r\n    deposit of the strata down to and including the Upper Silurian.\r\n    If, then, the evolutionary work done during this deposition only\r\n    represents a hundredth part of the sum total, we shall require\r\n    2,500,000,000 (two thousand five hundred million) years for the\r\n    complete development of the whole animal kingdom to its present\r\n    state. Even one quarter of this, however, would far exceed the\r\n    time which physics and astronomy seem able to allow for the\r\n    completion of the process.\r\n\r\n    Finally, a difficulty exists as to the reason of the absence of\r\n    rich fossiliferous deposits in the oldest strata—if life was then\r\n    as abundant and varied, as, on the Darwinian theory, it must have\r\n    been. Mr. Darwin himself admits “the case at present must remain\r\n    inexplicable; and this may be truly urged as a valid argument\r\n    against the views” entertained in his book.\r\n\r\n    Thus, then, we find a remarkable (and on Darwinian principles all\r\n    but inexplicable) absence of minutely graduated transitional\r\n    forms. All the most marked groups—bats, pterodactyles, chelonians,\r\n    ichthyosaurians, amoura, etc.—appear at once upon the scene. Even\r\n    the horse, the animal whose pedigree has been probably best\r\n    preserved, affords no conclusive evidence of specific origin by\r\n    significant fortuitous variations; while some forms, as the\r\n    labyrinthodonts and trilobites, which seemed to exhibit gradual\r\n    change, are shown by further investigation to do nothing of the\r\n    sort.... All these difficulties are avoided if we admit that new\r\n    forms of animal life of all degrees of complexity appear from time\r\n    to time with comparative suddenness, being evolved according to\r\n    laws in part depending on surrounding conditions, in part\r\n    internal—similar to the way in which crystals (and, perhaps from\r\n    recent researches, the lowest forms of life) build themselves up\r\n    according to the internal laws of their component substance, and\r\n    in harmony and correspondence with all environing influences and\r\n    conditions.(1649)\r\n\r\n\r\n“The internal laws of their component substance.” These are wise words,\r\nand the admission of the possibility is prudent. But how can these\r\ninternal laws be ever recognized, if Occult teaching be discarded? As a\r\nfriend writes, while drawing our attention to the above speculations:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In other words, the doctrine of Planetary Life‐Impulses must be\r\n    admitted. Otherwise, why are species now _stereotyped_, and why do\r\n    even domesticated breeds of pigeons and many animals relapse into\r\n    their ancestral types when left to themselves?\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the teaching about Planetary Life‐Impulses has to be clearly defined\r\nand as clearly understood, if present confusion is not to be made still\r\nmore perplexing. All these difficulties would vanish as the shadows of\r\nnight disappear before the light of the rising Sun, if the following\r\nEsoteric Axioms were admitted:\r\n\r\n(_a_) The existence and the enormous antiquity of our Planetary Chain;\r\n\r\n(_b_) The actuality of the Seven Rounds\r\n\r\n(_c_) The separation of human Races (outside the purely anthropological\r\ndivision) into seven distinct Root‐Races, of which our present European\r\nHumanity is the Fifth;\r\n\r\n(_d_) The antiquity of man in this (Fourth) Round; and finally\r\n\r\n(_e_) That as these Races evolve from ethereality to materiality, and from\r\nthe latter back again into relative physical tenuity of texture, so every\r\nliving (so‐called) _organic_ species of animals, with vegetation included,\r\nchanges with every new Root‐Race.\r\n\r\nWere this admitted, if even only along with other, and surely, on maturer\r\nconsideration, no less absurd, suppositions—if Occult theories have to be\r\nconsidered “absurd” at present—then every difficulty would be made away\r\nwith. Surely Science ought to try and be more logical than it now is, as\r\nit can hardly maintain the theory of man’s descent from an anthropoidal\r\nancestor, and deny in the same breath any reasonable antiquity to such a\r\nman! Once Mr. Huxley talks of “the vast intellectual chasm between the ape\r\nand man,” and “the present enormous gulf between them,”(1650) and admits\r\nthe necessity of extending scientific allowances for the age of man on\r\nEarth for such slow and progressive development, then all those men of\r\nScience who are of his way of thinking, at any rate, ought to come to at\r\nleast some approximate figures, and agree upon the probable duration of\r\nthose Pliocene, Miocene, and Eocene periods of which so much is said, and\r\nabout which nothing definite is known—even if they dare not venture\r\n_beyond_. But no two Scientists seem to agree. Every period seems to be a\r\nmystery in its duration, and a thorn in the side of the Geologists; and,\r\nas just shown, they are unable to harmonize their conclusions even with\r\nregard to the comparatively recent geological formations. Thus, no\r\nreliance can be placed on their figures when they do give any, for with\r\nthem it is all either millions or simply thousands of years!\r\n\r\nThat which is said may be strengthened by the confessions made by\r\nthemselves and the synopsis of these, to be found in that “Circle of\r\nSciences,” the _Encyclopædia Britannica_, which shows the mean accepted in\r\nthe geological and anthropological riddles. In that work the cream of the\r\nmost authoritative opinions is skimmed off and presented; nevertheless, we\r\nfind in it a refusal to assign any definite chronological date, even to\r\nsuch comparatively speaking late epochs as the Neolithic era, though, for\r\na wonder, an age is established for the beginnings of certain geological\r\nperiods; at any rate for some few, the duration of which could hardly be\r\nany more shortened, without an immediate conflict with facts.\r\n\r\nThus, it is surmised in the great Encyclopædia that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    One hundred million years have passed ... since the solidification\r\n    of our earth, when the earliest form of life appeared upon\r\n    it.(1651)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it seems quite as hopeless to try to convert the modern Geologists and\r\nEthnologists, as it is to make Darwinian Naturalists perceive their\r\nmistakes. About the Âryan Root‐Race and its origins, Science knows as\r\nlittle as of the men from other Planets. With the exception of Flammarion,\r\nand of a few Mystics among Astronomers, even the habitableness of other\r\nPlanets is mostly denied. Yet such great Adept Astronomers were the\r\nScientists of the earliest races of the Âryan stock, that they seem to\r\nhave known far more about the races of Mars and Venus than the modern\r\nAnthropologist knows of those of the early stages of the Earth.\r\n\r\nLet us leave Modern Science aside for a moment and turn to Ancient\r\nKnowledge. As we are assured by Archaic Scientists that all such\r\ngeological cataclysms—from the upheaval of oceans, deluges, and shifting\r\nof continents, down to the present year’s cyclones, hurricanes,\r\nearthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tidal waves, and even the extraordinary\r\nweather and seeming shifting of seasons which are perplexing all European\r\nand American Meteorologists—are due to, and depend on the Moon and\r\nPlanets; aye, that even modest and neglected constellations have the\r\ngreatest influence on the meteorological and cosmical changes, over, and\r\nwithin our Earth—let us give one moment’s attention to our sidereal\r\ndespots, the rulers of our globe and men. Modern Science denies any such\r\ninfluence; Archaic Science affirms it. We will see what both say with\r\nregard to this question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB. On Chains Of Planets And Their Plurality.\r\n\r\n\r\nDid the Ancients know of Worlds besides their own? What are the data of\r\nthe Occultists in affirming that every Globe is a Septenary Chain of\r\nWorlds—of which only one member is visible—and that these are, were, or\r\nwill be, “man‐bearing,” just as is every visible Star or Planet? What do\r\nthey mean by “a moral and physical influence” exerted on our Globe by the\r\nSidereal Worlds?\r\n\r\nSuch are the questions often put to us, and they have to be considered\r\nfrom every aspect. To the first of the two queries the answer is: We\r\nbelieve it because the first law in nature is uniformity in diversity, and\r\nthe second is analogy. “As above, so below.” The time is gone by for ever\r\nwhen our pious ancestors believed that our Earth was in the centre of the\r\nUniverse, and the Church and her arrogant servants could insist that the\r\nsupposition that any other Planet could be inhabited should be regarded as\r\nblasphemy. Adam and Eve, the Serpent and Original Sin, followed by\r\nAtonement through Blood, have been too long in the way of progress, and\r\nuniversal truth has thus been sacrificed to the insane conceit of us\r\nlittle men.\r\n\r\nNow what are the proofs thereof? Beyond inferential evidence and logical\r\nreasoning, there are none for the profane. To the Occultists, who believe\r\nin the knowledge acquired by countless generations of Seers and Initiates,\r\nthe data offered in the Secret Books are all‐sufficient. The general\r\npublic needs other proofs, however. There are some Kabalists, and even\r\nsome Eastern Occultists, who, failing to find uniform evidence upon this\r\npoint in all the mystic works of the nations, hesitate to accept the\r\nteaching. Even such “uniform evidence” will be forthcoming presently.\r\nMeanwhile, we may approach the subject from its general aspect, and see\r\nwhether belief in it is so very absurd, as some Scientists along with\r\nother Nicodemuses would have it. Unconsciously, perhaps, in thinking of a\r\nplurality of inhabited “Worlds,” we imagine them to be like the Globe we\r\ninhabit, and to be peopled by beings more or less resembling ourselves.\r\nAnd in so doing we are only following a natural instinct. Indeed, so long\r\nas the enquiry is confined to the life‐history of this Globe, we can\r\nspeculate on the question with some profit, and ask ourselves, with some\r\nhope of at least asking an intelligible question, what were the “Worlds”\r\nspoken of in all the ancient scriptures of Humanity? But how do we know\r\n(_a_) what kind of beings inhabit the Globes in general; and (_b_) whether\r\nthose who rule Planets superior to our own do not exercise the same\r\ninfluence on our Earth _consciously_, that we may exercise\r\n_unconsciously_, say on the small planets (planetoids or asteroids) in the\r\nlong run, by our cutting the Earth in pieces, opening canals, and thereby\r\nentirely changing our climates. Of course, like Cæsar’s wife, the\r\nplanetoids, cannot be affected by our suspicion. They are too far, etc.\r\nBelieving in Esoteric Astronomy, however, we are not so sure of that.\r\n\r\nBut when, extending our speculations beyond our Planetary Chain, we try to\r\ncross the limits of the Solar System, then indeed we act as do\r\npresumptuous fools. For—while accepting the old Hermetic axiom, “as above,\r\nso below”—as we may well believe that Nature on Earth displays the most\r\ncareful economy, utilizing every vile and waste thing in her marvellous\r\ntransformations, and withal _never_ repeating herself, so we may justly\r\nconclude that there is no other Globe in all her infinite systems so\r\nclosely resembling this Earth, that the ordinary powers of man’s thought\r\nshould be able to imagine and reproduce its semblance and\r\ncontainment.(1652)\r\n\r\nAnd indeed we find in the romances as in all the so‐called scientific\r\nfictions and spiritistic “revelations” from Moon, Stars, and Planets,\r\nmerely fresh combinations or modifications of the men and things, the\r\npassions and forms of life, with which we are familiar, though even on the\r\nother Planets of our own System nature and life are entirely different\r\nfrom those prevailing on our own. Swedenborg was preeminent in inculcating\r\nsuch an erroneous belief.\r\n\r\nBut even more. The ordinary man has no experience of any state of\r\nconsciousness other than that to which the physical senses link him. Men\r\ndream; they sleep the profound sleep which is too deep for its dreams to\r\nimpress the physical brain; and in these states there must still be\r\nconsciousness. How, then, while these mysteries remain unexplored, can\r\n_we_ hope to speculate with profit on the nature of Globes which, in the\r\neconomy of Nature, must needs belong to states of consciousness other and\r\nquite different from _any_ which man experiences here?\r\n\r\nAnd this is true to the letter. For even great Adepts (those initiated of\r\ncourse), trained Seers though they be, can only claim thorough\r\nacquaintance with the nature and appearance of Planets and their\r\ninhabitants belonging to our Solar System. They _know_ that almost all the\r\nPlanetary Worlds are inhabited, but—even in spirit—they can have access\r\nonly to those of our System; and they are also aware how difficult it is,\r\n_even for them_, to put themselves into full rapport even with the planes\r\nof consciousness _within_ our System, differing as they do from the states\r\nof consciousness possible on this Globe; such, for instance, as those\r\nwhich exist on the Chain of Spheres on the three planes beyond that of our\r\nEarth. Such knowledge and intercourse are possible to them because they\r\nhave learned how to penetrate to planes of consciousness which are closed\r\nto the perceptions of ordinary men; but were they to communicate their\r\nknowledge, the world would be no wiser, because men lack that experience\r\nof other forms of perception which alone could enable them to grasp what\r\nthey might be told.\r\n\r\nStill the fact remains that most of the Planets, like the Stars beyond our\r\nSystem, are inhabited, a fact which has been admitted by the men of\r\nScience themselves. Laplace and Herschel believed it, though they wisely\r\nabstained from imprudent speculation; and the same conclusion has been\r\nworked out and supported with an array of scientific considerations by C.\r\nFlammarion, the well‐known French Astronomer. The arguments he brings\r\nforward are strictly scientific, and are such as appeal even to a\r\nmaterialistic mind, which would remain unmoved by such thoughts as those\r\nof Sir David Brewster, the famous Physicist, who writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Those “barren spirits” or “base souls,” as the poet calls them,\r\n    who might be led to believe that the earth is the only inhabited\r\n    body in the universe, would have no difficulty in conceiving the\r\n    earth also to have been destitute of inhabitants. What is more, if\r\n    such minds were acquainted with the deductions of geology, they\r\n    would admit that it was uninhabited for myriads of years; and here\r\n    we come to the impossible conclusion that during these myriads of\r\n    years there was not a single intelligent creature in the vast\r\n    domains of the Universal King, and that before the protozoic\r\n    formations there existed neither plant nor animal in all the\r\n    infinity of space.(1653)\r\n\r\n\r\nFlammarion shows, in addition, that all the conditions of life—even as\r\n_we_ know it—are present on some at least of the Planets, and points to\r\nthe fact that these conditions must be much more favourable on them than\r\nthey are on our Earth.\r\n\r\nThus scientific reasoning, as well as observed facts, concurs with the\r\nstatements of the Seer, and the innate voice in man’s own heart in\r\ndeclaring that life—intelligent, conscious life—_must_ exist on other\r\nworlds than ours.\r\n\r\nBut this is the limit beyond which the ordinary faculties of man cannot\r\ncarry him. Many are the romances and tales, some purely fanciful, others\r\nbristling with scientific knowledge, which have attempted to imagine and\r\ndescribe life on other Globes. But one and all they give but some\r\ndistorted copy of the drama of life around us. It is either, with\r\nVoltaire, the men of our own race under a microscope, or, with de\r\nBergerac, a graceful play of fancy and satire; but we always find that at\r\nbottom the new world is but the one we ourselves live in. So strong is\r\nthis tendency that even great natural, though non‐initiated, Seers, fall\r\nvictims to it when untrained; witness Swedenborg, who goes so far as to\r\ndress the inhabitants of Mercury, whom he meets with in the spirit‐world,\r\nin clothes such as are worn in Europe!\r\n\r\nCommenting on this tendency, Flammarion says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It seems as if in the eyes of those authors who have written on\r\n    this subject, the Earth were the type of the Universe, and the man\r\n    of Earth, the type of the inhabitants of the Heavens. It is, on\r\n    the contrary, much more probable, that, since the nature of other\r\n    planets is essentially varied, and the surroundings and conditions\r\n    of existence essentially different, while the forces which preside\r\n    over the creation of beings and the substances which enter into\r\n    their mutual constitution are essentially distinct, it would\r\n    follow that our mode of existence cannot be regarded as in any way\r\n    applicable to other globes. Those who have written on this subject\r\n    have allowed themselves to be dominated by terrestrial ideas, and\r\n    have therefore fallen into error.(1654)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Flammarion himself falls into the very error which he here condemns,\r\nfor he tacitly takes the conditions of life on Earth as the standard by\r\nwhich to determine the degree to which other Planets are adapted for\r\nhabitation by “other humanities.”\r\n\r\nLet us, however, leave these profitless and empty speculations, which,\r\nthough they seem to fill our hearts with a glow of enthusiasm and to\r\nenlarge our mental and spiritual grasp, do but in reality cause a\r\nfactitious stimulation, and blind us more and more to our ignorance not\r\nonly of the world we inhabit, but even of the infinitude contained within\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, we find “other worlds” spoken of in the Bibles of\r\nHumanity, we may safely conclude that they not only refer to other states\r\nof our Planetary Chain and Earth, but also to other inhabited Globes—Stars\r\nand Planets; withal, that no speculations were ever made about the latter.\r\nThe whole of antiquity believed in the Universality of Life. But no really\r\ninitiated Seer of any civilized nation has ever taught that life on other\r\nStars could be judged by the standard of terrestrial life. What is\r\ngenerally meant by “Earths” and “Worlds,” relates (_a_) to the “rebirths”\r\nof our Globe after each Manvantara and a long period of Obscuration; and\r\n(_b_) to the periodical and entire changes of the Earth’s surface, when\r\ncontinents disappear to make room for oceans, and oceans and seas are\r\nviolently displaced and sent rolling to the poles, to cede their\r\nemplacements to new continents.\r\n\r\nWe may begin with the _Bible_—the youngest of the World‐scriptures. In\r\n_Ecclesiastes_, we read these words of the King‐Initiate:\r\n\r\n\r\n    One generation passeth away and another generation cometh, but the\r\n    earth abideth for ever.... The thing that hath been, it is that\r\n    which shall be; and that which is done, is that which shall be\r\n    done, and there is no new thing under the sun.(1655)\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder these words it is not easy to see the reference to the successive\r\ncataclysms by which the Races of mankind are swept away, or, going further\r\nback, to the various transitions of the Globe during the process of its\r\nformation. But if we are told that this refers only to _our_ world _as we\r\nnow see it_, then we shall refer the reader to the _New Testament_, where\r\nSt. Paul speaks of the Son (the manifested Power) whom God hath appointed\r\nheir of all things, “by whom also he made the worlds” (plural).(1656) This\r\n“Power” is Chokmah, the Wisdom and the Word.\r\n\r\nWe shall probably be told that by the term “worlds,” the stars, heavenly\r\nbodies, etc., were meant. But apart from the fact that “stars” were not\r\nknown as “worlds” to the ignorant editors of the Epistles, even if they\r\nmust have been thus known to Paul, who was an Initiate, a “Master‐\r\nBuilder,” we can quote on this point an eminent Theologian, Cardinal\r\nWiseman. In his work (i. 309) treating of the indefinite period of the six\r\ndays—or shall we say “too definite” period of the six days—of creation and\r\nthe 6,000 years, he confesses that we are in total darkness as to the\r\nmeaning of this statement of St. Paul, unless we are permitted to suppose\r\nthat allusion is made in it to the period which elapsed between the\r\n_first_ and _second_ verses of chapter i of _Genesis_, and thus to those\r\nprimitive revolutions, _i.e._, the destructions and the reproductions of\r\nthe world, indicated in chapter i of _Ecclesiastes_; or, to accept, with\r\nso many others, and in its _literal sense_, the passage in chapter i of\r\n_Hebrews_, that speaks of the creation of “worlds”—in the plural. It is\r\nvery singular, he adds, that all the cosmogonies should agree to suggest\r\nthe same idea, and preserve the tradition of a first series of\r\nrevolutions, owing to which the world was destroyed and again renewed.\r\n\r\nHad the Cardinal studied the _Zohar_ his doubts would have been changed\r\ninto certainties. Thus saith the “Idra Suta”:\r\n\r\n\r\n    There were old worlds which perished as soon as they came into\r\n    existence; worlds with and without form called Scintillas—for they\r\n    were like the sparks under the smith’s hammer, flying in all\r\n    directions. Some were the primordial worlds which could not\r\n    continue long, because the “Aged”—his name be sanctified—had not\r\n    as yet assumed his form,(1657) the workman was not yet the\r\n    “Heavenly Man.”(1658)\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain in the _Midrash_, written long before the _Kabalah_ of Simeon Ben\r\nIochai, Rabbi Abahu explains:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Holy One, blessed be his name, has successively formed and\r\n    destroyed sundry worlds before this one(1659).... Now this refers\r\n    both to the first races [the “Kings of Edom”] and to the worlds\r\n    destroyed.(1660)\r\n\r\n\r\n“Destroyed” means here what we call “obscuration.” This becomes evident\r\nwhen we read the explanation given further on:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Still when it is said that they [the worlds] _perished_, it is\r\n    only meant thereby that they [their humanities] lacked the true\r\n    form, till the human [our] form came into being, in which all\r\n    things are comprised and which contains all forms ...—it does not\r\n    mean death, but only denotes a sinking down from their status\r\n    [that of worlds in activity].(1661)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, we read of the “destruction” of the Worlds, the word has\r\nmany meanings, which are very clear in several of the Commentaries on the\r\n_Zohar_ and in Kabalistic treatises. As said elsewhere, it means not only\r\nthe destruction of many Worlds which have ended their life‐career, but\r\nalso that of the several Continents which have disappeared, as also their\r\ndecline and geographical change of place.\r\n\r\nThe mysterious “Kings of Edom” are sometimes referred to as the “Worlds”\r\nthat had been destroyed; but it is a “cloak.” The Kings who reigned in\r\nEdom before there reigned a King in Israel, or the “Edomite Kings,” could\r\nnever symbolize the “prior worlds,” but only the “attempts at men” on this\r\nGlobe—the Pre‐Adamite Races, of which the _Zohar_ speaks, and which we\r\nexplain as the First Root‐Race. For as, speaking of the six Earths (the\r\nsix “Limbs” of Microprosopus), it is said that the seventh (our Earth)\r\ncame not into the computation when the six were created (the six Spheres\r\nabove our Globe in the Terrestrial Chain), so the first seven Kings of\r\nEdom are left out of calculation in _Genesis_. By the law of analogy and\r\npermutation, in the Chaldæan _Book of Numbers_, as also in the _Books of\r\nKnowledge_ and of _Wisdom_, the “seven primordial worlds” mean also the\r\n“seven primordial” races (sub‐races of the First Root‐Race of the\r\nShadows); and, again, the Kings of Edom are the sons of “Esau, the father\r\nof the Edomites”;(1662) _i.e._, Esau represents in the _Bible_ the race\r\nwhich stands between the Fourth and the Fifth, the Atlantean and the\r\nÂryan. “Two _nations_ are in thy womb,” said the Lord to Rebekah; and Esau\r\nwas _red_ and _hairy_. From verse 24 to 34, chapter xxv of _Genesis_\r\ncontains the allegorical history of the birth of the Fifth Race.\r\n\r\nSays the _Siphra Dtzenioutha_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    And the Kings of ancient days died and their chiefs [crowns] were\r\n    found no more.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the _Zohar_ states:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Head of a nation that has not been formed at the beginning in\r\n    the likeness of the White Head: its people is not from this\r\n    Form.... Before it [the White Head, the Fifth Race or Ancient of\r\n    the Ancients] arranged itself in its [own, or present] Form ...\r\n    all Worlds have been destroyed; therefore it is written: and Bela,\r\n    the Son of Beor, reigned in Edom [_Gen._, xxxvi. Here the “Worlds”\r\n    stand for Races]. And he [such or another King of Edom] died, and\r\n    another reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo Kabalist who has hitherto treated of the symbolism and allegory hidden\r\nunder these “Kings of Edom” seems to have perceived more than one aspect\r\nof them. They are neither the “worlds that were destroyed,” nor the “Kings\r\nthat died”—alone; but both, and much more, to treat of which there is no\r\nspace at present. Therefore, leaving the mystic parables of the _Zohar_,\r\nwe will return to the hard facts of materialistic Science; first, however,\r\nciting a few from the long list of great thinkers who have believed in the\r\nplurality of inhabited Worlds in general, and in Worlds that preceded our\r\nown. These are, the great mathematicians Leibnitz and Bernouilli, Sir\r\nIsaac Newton himself, as may be read in his _Optics_; Buffon, the\r\nNaturalist; Condillac, the Sceptic; Bailly, Lavater, Bernardin de St.\r\nPierre, and, as a contrast to the two last named—suspected at least of\r\nMysticism—Diderot and most of the writers of the _Encyclopædia_. Following\r\nthese come Kant, the founder of modern Philosophy; the poet Philosophers,\r\nGoethe, Krause, Schelling; and many Astronomers, from Bode, Fergusson and\r\nHerschel, to Lalande and Laplace, with their many disciples in more recent\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nA brilliant list of honoured names indeed; but the facts of physical\r\nAstronomy speak even more strongly than these names in favour of the\r\npresence of life, of even organized life, on other Planets. Thus in four\r\nmeteorites which fell respectively at Alais in France, in the Cape of Good\r\nHope, in Hungary, and again in France, on analysis, there was found\r\ngraphite, a form of carbon known to be invariably associated with organic\r\nlife on this Earth of ours. And that the presence of this carbon is not\r\ndue to any action occurring within our atmosphere is shown by the fact\r\nthat carbon has been found in the very centre of a meteorite; while in one\r\nwhich fell at Argueil, in the south of France, in 1857, there was found\r\nwater and turf, the latter being always formed by the decomposition of\r\nvegetable substances.\r\n\r\nAnd further, examining the astronomical conditions of the other Planets,\r\nit is easy to show that several are far better adapted for the development\r\nof life and intelligence—even under the conditions with which men are\r\nacquainted—than is our Earth. For instance, on the Planet Jupiter the\r\nseasons, instead of varying between wide limits as do ours, change by\r\nalmost imperceptible degrees, and last twelve times as long as ours. Owing\r\nto the inclination of its axis the seasons on Jupiter are due almost\r\nentirely to the eccentricity of its orbit, and hence change slowly and\r\nregularly. We shall be told, that no life is possible on Jupiter, as it is\r\nin an incandescent state. But not all Astronomers agree with this. For\r\ninstance, what we state is declared by M. Flammarion; and _he_ ought to\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand Venus would be less adapted for human life such as\r\nexists on Earth, since its seasons are more extreme and its changes of\r\ntemperature more sudden; though it is curious that the duration of the day\r\nis nearly the same on the four inner planets, Mercury, Venus, the Earth\r\nand Mars.\r\n\r\nOn Mercury, the Sun’s heat and light are seven times what they are on the\r\nEarth, and Astronomy teaches that it is enveloped in a very dense\r\natmosphere. And as we see that life appears more active on Earth in\r\nproportion to the light and heat of the Sun, it would seem more than\r\nprobable that its intensity is far, far greater on Mercury than here.\r\n\r\nVenus, like Mercury, has a very dense atmosphere, as also has Mars, and\r\nthe snows which cover their poles, the clouds which hide their surface,\r\nthe geographical configuration of their seas and continents, the\r\nvariations of seasons and climates, are all closely analogous—at least to\r\nthe eye of the physical Astronomer. But such facts and the considerations\r\nto which they give rise have reference only to the possibility of the\r\nexistence on these Planets of human life as known on Earth. That some\r\nforms of life such as we know are _possible_ on these Planets, has been\r\nlong since abundantly demonstrated, and it seems perfectly useless to go\r\ninto detailed questions of the physiology, etc., of these hypothetical\r\ninhabitants, since, after all, the reader can arrive only at an imaginary\r\nextension of his familiar surroundings. It is better to rest content with\r\nthe three conclusions which M. Flammarion, whom we have so largely quoted,\r\nformulates as rigorous and exact deductions from the known _facts_ and\r\nlaws of Science.\r\n\r\ni. The various forces which were active in the beginning of evolution gave\r\nbirth to a great variety of beings on the several worlds; both in the\r\norganic and inorganic kingdoms.\r\n\r\nii. The animated beings were constituted from the first according to forms\r\nand organisms in correlation with the physiological state of each\r\ninhabited globe.\r\n\r\niii. The humanities of other worlds differ from us, as much in their inner\r\norganization as in their external physical type.\r\n\r\nFinally the reader who may be disposed to question the validity of these\r\nconclusions as being opposed to the _Bible_, may be referred to an\r\nAppendix in M. Flammarion’s work dealing in detail with this question,\r\nsince in a work like the present it seems unnecessary to point out the\r\nlogical absurdity of those churchmen who deny the plurality of worlds on\r\nthe ground of biblical authority.\r\n\r\nIn this connection we may well recall those days when the burning zeal of\r\nthe Primitive Church opposed the doctrine of the Earth’s rotundity, on the\r\nground that the nations at the Antipodes would be outside the pale of\r\nsalvation; and again, we may remember how long it took for a nascent\r\nScience to break down the idea of a solid firmament, in the grooves of\r\nwhich the stars moved for the special edification of terrestrial humanity.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the Earth’s rotation was met by a like opposition—even to\r\nthe martyrdom of its discoverers—because, besides depriving our orb of its\r\ndignified central position in space, the theory produced an appalling\r\nconfusion of ideas as to the Ascension—the terms “up” and “down” being\r\nproved to be merely relative, thus complicating not a little the question\r\nof the precise locality of Heaven!(1663)\r\n\r\nAccording to the best modern calculations, there are no less than\r\n500,000,000 Stars of various magnitudes, within the range of the best\r\ntelescopes. As to the distances between them, they are incalculable. Is,\r\nthen, our microscopical Earth—a “grain of sand on an infinite sea‐\r\nshore”—the only centre of intelligent life? Our own Sun, itself 1,300,000\r\ntimes larger than our Planet, sinks into insignificance beside the giant\r\nSun, Sirius, and the latter in its turn is dwarfed by other luminaries in\r\ninfinite Space. The self‐centred conception of Jehovah as the special\r\nguardian of a small and obscure semi‐nomadic tribe, is tolerable beside\r\nthat which confines sentient existence to our microscopical Globe. The\r\nprimary reasons were without doubt: (_a_) astronomical ignorance on the\r\npart of the early Christians, coupled with an exaggerated appreciation of\r\nman’s own importance—a crude form of selfishness; and (_b_) the dread\r\nthat, if the hypothesis of millions of other inhabited Globes were\r\naccepted, the crushing rejoinder would ensue: “Was there then a Revelation\r\nto each World?”—involving the idea of the Son of God eternally “going the\r\nrounds,” as it were. Happily it is now unnecessary to waste time and\r\nenergy in proving the possibility of the existence of such Worlds. All\r\nintelligent persons admit it. That which now remains to be demonstrated\r\nis, that if it is once proven that there are inhabited Worlds besides our\r\nown, with humanities entirely different from each other as from our own—as\r\nmaintained in the Occult Sciences—then the evolution of the preceding\r\nRaces is half proved. For where is that Physicist or Geologist who is\r\nprepared to maintain that the Earth has not changed scores of times, in\r\nthe millions of years which have elapsed in the course of its existence;\r\nand that changing its “skin,” as it is called in Occultism, the Earth has\r\nnot had each time her special Humanities adapted to such atmospheric and\r\nclimatic conditions as were entailed by such change? And if so, why should\r\nnot our preceding four and entirely different Mankinds have existed and\r\nthrived before our Adamic Fifth Root Race?\r\n\r\nBefore closing our debate, however, we have to examine the so‐called\r\norganic evolution more closely. Let us search well and see whether it is\r\nquite impossible to make our Occult data and chronology agree—up to a\r\ncertain point—with those of Science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC. Supplementary Remarks On Esoteric Geological Chronology.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems possible to calculate the approximate duration at any rate of the\r\ngeological periods from the combined data of Science and Occultism now\r\nbefore us. Geology is, of course, able to determine one thing with almost\r\ncertainty—the thickness of the several deposits. Now, it also stands to\r\nreason that the time required for the deposition of any stratum on a sea‐\r\nbottom must bear a strict proportion to the thickness of the mass thus\r\nformed. Doubtless the _rate_ of the erosion of land, and of the sorting\r\nout of matter on to ocean beds, has varied from age to age, and\r\ncataclysmic changes of various kinds have broken the “uniformity” of\r\nordinary geological processes. Provided, then, that we have some definite\r\nnumerical basis on which to work, our task is rendered less difficult than\r\nit might at first sight appear. Making due allowance for variations in the\r\nrate of deposit, Professor Lefèvre gives us the relative figures which sum\r\nup geological time. He does not attempt to calculate the lapse of years\r\nsince the first bed of the Laurentian rocks was deposited, but postulating\r\nthat time as _x_, he presents us with the relative proportions in which\r\nthe various periods stand to it. Let us premise our estimate by stating\r\nthat, roughly speaking, the Primordial rocks are 70,000 ft., the Primary\r\n42,000 ft., the Secondary 15,000 ft., the Tertiary 5,000 ft., and the\r\nQuaternary some 500 ft. in thickness:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Dividing into a hundred parts the time, _whatever its actual\r\n    length_, that has passed since the dawn of life on this earth\r\n    [lower Laurentian strata], we shall be led to attribute to the\r\n    Primordial age more than half of the whole duration, say 53.5; to\r\n    the Primary 32.2; to the Secondary 11.5; to the Tertiary 2.3; to\r\n    the Quaternary 0.5 or one‐half per cent.(1664)\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, as it is certain, on Occult data, that the time which has elapsed\r\nsince the first sedimentary deposits is 320,000,000 years, we are able to\r\nconstruct the following table:\r\n\r\nROUGH APPROXIMATIONS OF LENGTH OF GEOLOGICAL PERIODS IN YEARS.\r\n\r\nPrimordial (Laurentian, Cambrian, Silurian): 171,200,000.\r\n\r\nPrimary (Devonian, Coal, Permian): 103,040,000.\r\n\r\nSecondary (Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous): 36,800,000.\r\n\r\nTertiary (Eocene, Miocene, Pliocene): 7,360,000.\r\n\r\nQuaternary: 1,600,000.(1665)\r\n\r\nSuch estimates harmonize with the statements of Esoteric Ethnology in\r\nalmost every particular. The Tertiary Atlantean part‐cycle, from the “apex\r\nof glory” of that Race in the early Eocene to the great Mid‐Miocene\r\ncataclysm, would appear to have lasted some three‐and‐a‐half to four\r\nmillion years. If the duration of the Quaternary is not, as seems likely,\r\nrather over‐estimated, the sinking of Ruta and Daitya would be Post‐\r\nTertiary. It is probable that the results here given allow somewhat too\r\nlong a period to both the Tertiary and Quaternary, as the Third Race goes\r\nvery far back into the Secondary age. Nevertheless, the figures are most\r\nsuggestive.\r\n\r\nBut the argument from geological evidence being in favour of only\r\n100,000,000 years, let us compare our claims and teachings with those of\r\nexact Science.\r\n\r\nMr. Edward Clodd,(1666) in referring to M. de Mortillet’s work _Matériaux\r\npour l’Histoire de l’Homme_, which places man in the Mid‐Miocene\r\nperiod,(1667) remarks that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It would be in defiance of all that the doctrine of evolution\r\n    teaches, and moreover win no support from believers in special\r\n    creation and the fixity of species, to seek for so highly\r\n    specialized a mammalian as man at an early stage in the life‐\r\n    history of the globe.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this, one could answer: (_a_) the doctrine of evolution, as inaugurated\r\nby Darwin and developed by later evolutionists, is not only the reverse of\r\ninfallible, but it is repudiated by several great men of Science, _e.g._,\r\nde Quatrefages, in France, Dr. Weismann, an ex‐evolutionist in Germany,\r\nand many others, the ranks of the Anti‐Darwinists growing stronger with\r\nevery year;(1668) and (_b_) truth to be worthy of its name, and remain\r\ntruth and fact, hardly needs to beg for support from any class or sect.\r\nFor were it to win support from believers in special creation, it would\r\nnever gain the favour of the evolutionists, and _vice versâ_. Truth must\r\nrest upon its own firm foundation of facts, and take its chance of\r\nrecognition, when every prejudice in the way is disposed of. Though the\r\nquestion has been already fully considered in its main aspect, it is,\r\nnevertheless, advisable to combat every so‐called “scientific” objection\r\nas we go along, when making what are regarded as heretical and anti‐\r\nscientific statements.\r\n\r\nLet us briefly glance at the divergencies between orthodox and Esoteric\r\nScience, on the question of the age of the globe and of man. With the two\r\nrespective synchronistic tables before him, the reader will be enabled to\r\nsee at a glance the importance of these divergencies; and to perceive, at\r\nthe same time, that it is not impossible—nay, it is most likely—that\r\nfurther discoveries in Geology and the finding of fossil remains of man\r\nwill force Science to confess that it is Esoteric Philosophy which is\r\nright after all, or, at any rate, nearer to the truth.\r\n\r\nPARALLELISM OF LIFE.\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESES: Science divides the period of the Globe’s history,\r\nsince the beginning of life on Earth (or the Azoic age), into five main\r\ndivisions or periods, according to Hæckel.(1669)\r\n\r\nESOTERIC THEORY: Leaving the classification of the geological periods to\r\nWestern Science, Esoteric Philosophy divides only the Life‐periods on the\r\nGlobe. In the present Manvantara the actual period is separated into seven\r\nKalpas and seven great human Races. Its first Kalpa, answering to the\r\nPrimordial Epoch is the age of the Primeval.\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC: PRIMORDIAL EPOCH: Laurentian, Cambrian, Silurian. The\r\nPrimordial epoch, Science tells us, is by no means devoid of vegetable and\r\nanimal life. In the Laurentian deposits are found specimens of the Eozoon\r\ncanadense—a chambered shell. In the Silurian are discovered sea‐weeds\r\n(algæ), molluscs, crustacea, and lower marine organisms, also the first\r\ntrace of fishes. The Primordial epoch shows algæ, molluscs, crustacea,\r\npolyps, and marine organisms, etc. Science teaches, therefore, that marine\r\nlife was present from the very beginnings of time, leaving us, however, to\r\nspeculate for ourselves as to _how_ life appeared on Earth. If it rejects\r\nthe biblical “creation” (as we do), why does it not give us another,\r\napproximately plausible hypothesis?\r\n\r\nESOTERIC: “PRIMEVAL”(1670): Devas or Divine Men, the “Creators” and\r\nProgenitors.(1671) The Esoteric Philosophy agrees with the statement made\r\nby Science (see preceding), demurring, however, to one particular. The\r\n300,000,000 years of vegetable life (see “Brâhmanical Chronology”)\r\npreceded the “Divine Men,” or Progenitors. Also, no teaching denies that\r\nthere were traces of life _within_ the Earth, besides the Eozoon\r\ncanadense, in the Primordial Epoch. Only, whereas the said vegetation\r\nbelonged to this Round, the zoological relics now found in the Laurentian,\r\nCambrian, and Silurian systems, so called, are the _relics_ of the Third\r\nRound. At first astral like the rest, they consolidated and materialized\r\n_pari passu_ with the new vegetation.\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC: PRIMARY: Devonian,(1672) Coal, Permian. “Fern‐forests,\r\nsigillaria, coniferæ, fishes, first trace of reptiles.” Thus saith Modern\r\nScience.\r\n\r\nESOTERIC: “PRIMARY”: Divine Progenitors (Secondary Groups), and the two\r\nand a half Races. The Esoteric Doctrine repeats that which was said above.\r\nThese are all relics of the preceding Round.(1673)\r\n\r\nOnce, however, the prototypes are projected out of the Astral Envelope of\r\nthe Earth, an indefinite amount of modification ensues.\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC: SECONDARY: Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous. This is the age of\r\nReptiles, of the gigantic megalosauri, ichthyosauri, plesiosauri, etc.\r\nScience denies the presence of man in this period. But it has still to\r\nexplain how men came to know of these monsters and describe them _before_\r\nthe age of Cuvier! The old annals of China, India, Egypt, and even of\r\nJudea are full of them, as demonstrated elsewhere. In this period also\r\nappear the first marsupial mammals(1674)—insectivorous, carnivorous,\r\nphytophagous; and, as Prof. Owen thinks, a herbiferous hoofed mammal.\r\n\r\nScience does not admit the appearance of man before _the close_ of the\r\nTertiary period.(1675) Why? Because man has to be shown younger than the\r\nhigher mammals. But Esoteric Philosophy teaches us the reverse. And as\r\nScience is quite unable to come to anything like an approximate conclusion\r\nas to the age of man, or even as to the geological periods, the Occult\r\nteaching is, therefore, more logical and reasonable, even if accepted only\r\nas a hypothesis.\r\n\r\nESOTERIC: “SECONDARY”: According to every calculation the Third Race had\r\nalready made its appearance, as during the Triassic there were already a\r\nfew mammals, and it must have separated before their appearance.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the age of the Third Race, in which the origins of the\r\nearly Fourth may be perhaps also discoverable. We are, however, here left\r\nentirely to conjecture, as no definite data are yet given out by the\r\nInitiates.\r\n\r\nThe analogy is but a poor one, still it may be argued that, as the early\r\nmammalia and pre‐mammalia are shown in their evolution merging from one\r\nkind into a higher one, anatomically, so are the human races in their\r\nprocreative processes. A parallel might certainly be found between the\r\nmonotremata, didelphia (or marsupialia) and the placental mammals, divided\r\nin their turn into three orders(1676) like the First, Second, and Third\r\nRoot‐Races of men.(1677) But this would require more space than can be now\r\nallotted to the subject.\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC: TERTIARY(1678): Eocene, Miocene, Pliocene. No man is yet\r\nallowed to have lived during this period.\r\n\r\nSays Mr. E. Clodd, in _Knowledge_: “Although the placental mammals and the\r\norder of primates to which man is related, appear in Tertiary times, and\r\nthe climate, tropical in the Eocene age, warm in the Miocene, and\r\ntemperate in the Pliocene, was favourable to his presence, the proofs of\r\nhis existence in Europe before the close of the Tertiary epoch ... are not\r\ngenerally accepted here.”\r\n\r\nESOTERIC: “TERTIARY”: The Third Race has now almost utterly disappeared,\r\ncarried away by the fearful geological cataclysms of the Secondary age,\r\nleaving behind it but a few hybrid races.\r\n\r\nThe Fourth, born millions of years before(1679) the said cataclysm took\r\nplace, perished during the Miocene period,(1680) when the Fifth (our Âryan\r\nRace) had had one million years of independent existence.(1681) How much\r\nolder it is from its origin—who knows? As the “historical” period began\r\nwith the Indian Âryans, with their _Vedas_ for their multitudes,(1682) and\r\nfar earlier in the Esoteric Records, it is useless to establish here any\r\nparallels.\r\n\r\nGeology has now divided the periods and placed man in the Quaternary.\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC: QUATERNARY: Palæolithic Man, Neolithic Man, Historical Period.\r\n\r\nESOTERIC: “QUATERNARY”: If the Quaternary period is allowed 1,500,000\r\nyears, then only does our Fifth Race belong to it.\r\n\r\nYet—_mirabile dictu_—while the non‐cannibal Palæolithic man, who must have\r\ncertainly antedated cannibal Neolithic man by hundreds of thousands of\r\nyears,(1683) is shown to be a remarkable artist, Neolithic man is made out\r\nto be almost an abject savage, his lake dwellings notwithstanding.(1684)\r\nFor see what a learned Geologist, Mr. Charles Gould, tells the reader in\r\nhis _Mythical Monsters_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Palæolithic men were unacquainted with pottery and the art of\r\n    weaving, and apparently had no domesticated animals or system of\r\n    cultivation; but the Neolithic lake‐dwellers of Switzerland had\r\n    looms, pottery, cereals, sheep, horses, etc. Implements of horn,\r\n    bone, and wood were in common use among both races, but those of\r\n    the older are frequently distinguished by their being sculptured\r\n    with great ability, or ornamented with life‐like engravings of the\r\n    various animals living at the period; whereas there appears to\r\n    have been a marked absence of any similar artistic ability(1685)\r\n    on the part of Neolithic man.(1686)\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us give the reasons for this.\r\n\r\n(1) The oldest fossil man, the primitive cave‐men of the old Palæolithic\r\nperiod, and of the Pre‐Glacial period (of whatever length, and however far\r\nback), is always the same genus man, and there are no fossil remains\r\nproving for him\r\n\r\n\r\n    What the Hipparion and Anchitherium have proved for the genus\r\n    horse—that is, gradual progressive specialization from a simple\r\n    ancestral type to more complex existing forms.(1687)\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) As to the so‐called Palæolithic hatchets:\r\n\r\n\r\n    When placed side by side with the rudest forms of stone hatchets\r\n    actually used by the Australian and other savages, it is difficult\r\n    to detect any difference.(1688)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis goes to prove that there have been savages _at all times_; and the\r\ninference would be that there might have been civilized people in those\r\ndays as well, cultured nations contemporary with those rude savages. We\r\nsee such a thing in Egypt 7,000 years ago.\r\n\r\n(3) An obstacle which is the direct consequence of the two preceding: Man,\r\nif no older than the Palæolithic period, could not possibly have had the\r\nactual time necessary for his transformation from the “missing link” into\r\nwhat he is known to have been even during that remote geological time,\r\n_i.e._, even _a finer specimen of manhood than many of the now existing\r\nraces_.\r\n\r\nThe above lends itself naturally to the following syllogism: (1) The\r\n_primitive_ man (known to Science) was, in some respects, even a finer man\r\nof his genus than he is now. (2) The earliest monkey known, the lemur, was\r\n_less_ anthropoid than the modern pithecoid species. (3) Conclusion: Even\r\nthough a _missing link_ were found, the balance of evidence would remain\r\nmore in favour of the ape _being a degenerated man_, made dumb by some\r\nfortuitous circumstances,(1689) than in favour of the descent of man from\r\na pithecoid ancestor. The theory cuts both ways.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the existence of Atlantis be accepted, and the\r\nstatement be believed that in the Eocene age—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Even in its very first part, the great cycle of the Fourth Race\r\n    men, the Atlanteans, had already reached its highest point,(1690)\r\n\r\n\r\nthen some of the present difficulties of Science might easily be made to\r\ndisappear. The rude workmanship of the Palæolithic tools proves nothing\r\nagainst the idea that, side by side with their makers, there lived nations\r\nhighly civilized. We are told that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Only a very small portion of the earth’s surface has been\r\n    explored, and of this a very small portion consists of ancient\r\n    land surfaces or fresh water formations, where alone we can expect\r\n    to meet with traces of the higher forms of animal life. And even\r\n    these have been so imperfectly explored, that where we now meet\r\n    with thousands and tens of thousands of undoubted human remains\r\n    lying almost under our feet, it is only within the last thirty\r\n    years that their existence has even been suspected.(1691)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is very suggestive also that along with the rude hatchets of the lowest\r\nsavage, explorers meet with specimens of workmanship of such artistic\r\nmerit as could hardly be found, or expected, in a modern peasant belonging\r\nto any European country—unless in exceptional cases. The “portrait” of the\r\n“Reindeer Feeding,” from the Thayngin grotto in Switzerland, and those of\r\nthe man running, with two horses’ heads sketched close to him—a work of\r\nthe Reindeer period, _i.e._, at least 50,000 years ago—are pronounced by\r\nMr. Laing to be not only exceedingly well done, but the former, the\r\n“Reindeer Feeding,” is described as one that “would do credit to any\r\nmodern animal painter”—by no means exaggerated praise, as anyone may see,\r\nby glancing at the sketch given below from Mr. Gould’s work. Now, since we\r\nhave our greatest painters of Europe side by side with the modern\r\nEsquimaux, who also have a tendency, like their Palæolithic ancestors of\r\nthe Reindeer period, the rude and savage human species, to be constantly\r\ndrawing with the point of their knives sketches of animals, scenes of the\r\nchase, etc., why could not the same have happened in those days? Compared\r\nwith the specimens of Egyptian drawing and sketching—7,000 years ago—the\r\n“earliest portraits” of men, horses’ heads, and reindeer, made 50,000\r\nyears ago, _are certainly superior_. Nevertheless, the Egyptians of those\r\nperiods are known to have been a highly civilized nation, whereas the\r\nPalæolithic men are called _savages_ of the lower type. This is a small\r\nmatter seemingly, yet it is extremely suggestive as showing how every new\r\ngeological discovery is made to fit in with current theories, instead of\r\nfitting the theories to include the discovery. Yes; Mr. Huxley is right in\r\nsaying, “Time will show.” It will, and it must vindicate Occultism.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the most uncompromising Materialists are driven by necessity\r\ninto the most Occult‐like admissions. Strange to say, it is the most\r\nmaterialistic—those of the German school—who, with regard to _physical_\r\ndevelopment, come the nearest to the teachings of the Occultists. Thus,\r\nProfessor Baumgärtner believes that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The germs for the higher animals could only be the eggs of the\r\n    lower animals; ... besides the advance of the vegetable and animal\r\n    world in development, there occurred in that period the formation\r\n    of _new original germs_ [which formed the basis of new\r\n    metamorphoses, etc.] ... the first men who proceeded from the\r\n    germs of animals beneath them, lived first in a larva state.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust so; in a larva state, we say too, only from no “animal” germ; and\r\nthat larva was the soulless astral form of the pre‐physical Races. And we\r\nbelieve, as the German professor does, with several other men of Science\r\nin Europe now, that the human races—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Have not descended from one pair, but appeared immediately in\r\n    numerous races.(1692)\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, when we read _Force and Matter_, and find that Emperor of\r\nMaterialists, Büchner, repeating after Manu and Hermes, that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Imperceptibly the plant glides into the animal, the animal into\r\n    the man(1693)\r\n\r\n\r\n—we need only add “and man into a spirit,” to complete the kabalistic\r\naxiom. The more so, since we read the following admission:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Evolved by spontaneous generation ... that whole rich and\r\n    multiform organic world ... has developed itself progressively, in\r\n    the course of endless periods of time, by the aid of natural\r\n    phenomena.(1694)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole difference lies in this: Modern Science places her materialistic\r\ntheory of primordial germs on Earth, and the _last germ_ of life on this\r\nGlobe, of man, and everything else, between _two voids_. Whence the\r\n_first_ germ, if both spontaneous generation and the interference of\r\nexternal forces, are absolutely rejected now? Germs of organic life, we\r\nare told, by Sir William Thompson, came to our Earth in some meteor. This\r\nhelps in no way, and only shifts the difficulty from this Earth to the\r\nsupposed meteor.\r\n\r\nThese are our agreements and disagreements with Science. About the\r\n“endless periods” we are, of course, at one even with materialistic\r\nspeculation; for we believe in Evolution, though on different lines.\r\nProfessor Huxley very wisely says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    If any form of the doctrine of progressive development is correct,\r\n    we must extend by long epochs the most liberal estimate that has\r\n    yet been made of the antiquity of man.(1695)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut when we are told that this man is a product of the natural forces\r\ninherent _in_ Matter—Force, according to modern views, being but a quality\r\nof Matter, a “mode of motion,” etc.—and when we find Sir William Thompson\r\nrepeating in 1885 what was asserted by Büchner and his school thirty years\r\nago, we fear all our reverence for real Science is vanishing into thin\r\nair! One can hardly help thinking that Materialism is, in certain cases, a\r\n_disease_. For when men of Science, in the face of magnetic phenomena and\r\nthe attraction of iron particles through insulating substances, like\r\nglass, maintain that the said attraction is due to “molecular motion,” or\r\nto the “rotation of the molecules of the magnet,” then, whether the\r\nteaching comes from a “credulous” Theosophist innocent of any notion of\r\nPhysics, or from an eminent man of Science, it is equally ridiculous. The\r\nindividual who asserts such a theory in the teeth of _fact_, is only one\r\nmore proof that: “When people have not a niche in their minds into which\r\nto shoot facts, so much the worse for the facts.”\r\n\r\nAt present the dispute between the spontaneous generationists and their\r\nopponents is at rest, having ended in the provisional victory of the\r\nlatter. But even they are forced to admit, as Büchner did, and Messrs.\r\nTyndall and Huxley still do—that spontaneous generation _must have\r\noccurred once_, under “special thermal conditions.” Virchow refuses even\r\nto argue the question; it _must_ have taken place some time in the history\r\nof our planet; and there’s an end of it. This seems to look more natural\r\nthan Sir William Thompson’s hypothesis just quoted, that the germs of\r\norganic life fell on our Earth in some meteor; or the other “scientific”\r\nhypothesis coupled with the recently adopted belief that there exists _no_\r\n“vital principle” whatever, but only vital phenomena, which can all be\r\ntraced to the molecular forces of the original protoplasm. But this does\r\nnot help Science to solve the still greater problem—the origin and the\r\n_descent_ of Man, for here is a still worse plaint and lamentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n    While we can trace the skeletons of Eocene mammals through several\r\n    directions of specialization in succeeding Tertiary times, man\r\n    presents the phenomenon of an _unspecialized_ skeleton which\r\n    cannot fairly be connected with any of these lines.(1696)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe secret could be soon told, not only from the Esoteric but even from\r\nthe standpoint of every religion the world over, without mentioning the\r\nOccultists. The “specialized skeleton” is sought for in the wrong place,\r\nwhere it can never be found. Scientists expect to discover it in the\r\nphysical remains of man, in some pithecoid “missing link,” with a skull\r\nlarger than that of the ape’s, and with a cranial capacity smaller than in\r\nman, instead of looking for that specialization in _the super‐physical\r\nessence of his inner astral constitution, which can hardly be excavated\r\nfrom any geological strata_! Such a tenacious, hopeful clinging to a self‐\r\ndegrading theory is the most wonderful feature of the day.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, there are specimens of engravings made by Palæolithic\r\n“savages”: Palæolithic meaning the “earlier Stone‐age” man, one supposed\r\nto have been as savage and brutal as the brutes he lived with. Leaving the\r\nmodern South Sea islander, or even any Asiatic race, aside, we defy any\r\ngrown‐up schoolboy, or even a European youth, one who has never studied\r\ndrawing, to execute such an engraving or even a pencil sketch as good.\r\nHere we have the true artistic _raccourci_, and correct lights and shadows\r\nwithout any _plane_ model before the artist, who copied direct from\r\nnature, thus exhibiting a knowledge of anatomy and proportion. The artist\r\nwho engraved this reindeer belonged, we are asked to believe, to the\r\nprimitive “semi‐animal” savages (contemporaneous with the mammoth and the\r\nwoolly rhinoceros), whom some over‐zealous Evolutionists once sought to\r\npicture to us as distinct approximations to the type of their hypothetical\r\n“pithecoid man”!\r\n\r\nThis engraved antler proves as eloquently as any fact can do, that the\r\nevolution of the Races has ever proceeded in a series of rises and falls,\r\nthat man is, perhaps, as old as incrustated Earth, and—if we can call his\r\ndivine ancestor “man”—is far older still.\r\n\r\nEven de Mortillet himself seems to experience a vague distrust of the\r\nconclusions of modern Archæologists, when he writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The pre‐historic is a new science, far, very far, from having said\r\n    its last word.(1697)\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Lyell, one of the highest authorities on the subject, and the\r\n“father” of Geology:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The expectation of always meeting with a lower type of human\r\n    skull, the older the formation in which it occurs, _is based on\r\n    the theory of progressive development_, and it _may_ prove to be\r\n    sound; nevertheless we must remember that as yet _we have no\r\n    distinct geological evidence that the appearance of what are\r\n    called the inferior races of mankind has always preceded in\r\n    chronological order that of the higher races_.(1698)\r\n\r\n\r\nNor has such evidence been found to this day. Science is thus offering for\r\nsale the skin of a bear, which has hitherto never been seen by mortal eye!\r\n\r\nThis concession of Lyell’s reads most suggestively with the subjoined\r\nutterance of Professor Max Müller, whose attack on Darwinian Anthropology\r\nfrom the standpoint of language has, by the way, never been satisfactorily\r\nanswered:\r\n\r\n\r\n    What do we know of savage tribes beyond the last chapter of their\r\n    history? [Compare this with the Esoteric view of the Australians,\r\n    Bushmen, as well as of Palæolithic European man, the Atlantean\r\n    offshoots retaining a relic of a lost culture, which throve when\r\n    the parent Root‐Race was in its prime.] Do we ever get an insight\r\n    into their antecedents? Can we ever understand what after all is\r\n    everywhere the most important and the most instructive lesson to\r\n    learn—how they have come to be what they are?... Their language\r\n    proves, indeed, that these so‐called heathens, with their\r\n    complicated systems of mythology, their artificial customs, their\r\n    unintelligible whims and savageries, are not the creatures of to‐\r\n    day or yesterday. Unless we admit a special creation for these\r\n    savages, they must be as old as the Hindûs, the Greeks and Romans\r\n    [far older] ... They may have passed through ever so many\r\n    vicissitudes, and what we consider as primitive, may be, for all\r\n    we know, a relapse into savagery or a corruption of something that\r\n    was more rational and intelligible in former stages.(1699)\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor George Rawlinson, M.A., remarks:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “The primeval savage” is a familiar term in modern literature, but\r\n    there is no evidence that the primeval savage ever existed. Rather\r\n    _all the evidence looks the other way_.(1700)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his _Origin of Nations_, he rightly adds:\r\n\r\n\r\n    _The mythical traditions of almost all nations place at the\r\n    beginning of human history a time of happiness and perfection_, a\r\n    “golden age” which has no features of savagery or barbarism, but\r\n    many of civilization and refinement.(1701)\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is the modern Evolutionist to meet this consensus of evidence?\r\n\r\nWe repeat the question asked in _Isis Unveiled_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Does the finding of the remains in the cave of Devon prove that\r\n    there were no contemporary races then who were highly civilized?\r\n    When the present population of the Earth has disappeared, and some\r\n    Archæologist belonging to the “coming race” of the distant future\r\n    shall excavate the domestic implements of one of our Indian or\r\n    Andaman Island tribes, will he be justified in concluding that\r\n    mankind in the nineteenth century was “just emerging from the\r\n    Stone age”?(1702)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother strange inconsistency in scientific theories is that Neolithic man\r\nis shown as being far more of a primitive savage than Palæolithic. Either\r\nLubbock’s _Pre‐historic Man_, or Evans’ _Ancient Stone Implements_ must be\r\nat fault, or—both. For this is what we learn from these works and others:\r\n\r\n(1) As we pass from Neolithic to Palæolithic man, the stone implements\r\nbecome rude lumbering makeshifts, instead of gracefully shaped and\r\npolished instruments. Pottery, and other useful arts disappear as we\r\ndescend the scale. And yet the latter could engrave such a reindeer!\r\n\r\n(2) Palæolithic man lived in caves which he shared with hyænas and\r\nlions,(1703) whereas Neolithic man dwelt in lake‐villages and buildings.\r\n\r\nEvery one who has followed even superficially the geological discoveries\r\nof our day, knows that a gradual improvement in workmanship is found, from\r\nthe clumsy chipping and rude chopping of the early Palæolithic hatchets,\r\nto the relatively graceful stone celts of that part of the Neolithic\r\nperiod immediately preceding the use of metals. But this is _in Europe_,\r\nonly a few portions of which were barely rising from the waters in the\r\ndays of the highest Atlantean civilization. There were rude savages and\r\nhighly civilized people then, as there are now. If 50,000 years hence,\r\npigmy Bushmen are exhumed from some African cavern together with far\r\nearlier pigmy elephants, such as were found in the cave deposits of Malta\r\nby Milne Edwards, will that be a reason for maintaining that in our age\r\nall men and all elephants were pigmies? Or if the weapons of the Veddhas\r\nof Ceylon are found, will our descendants be justified in setting us all\r\ndown as Palæolithic savages? All the articles which Geologists now\r\nexcavate in Europe can certainly never date earlier than the close of the\r\nEocene age, since the lands of Europe were not even above water before\r\nthat period. Nor can what we have said be in the least invalidated by\r\ntheorists telling us that these quaint sketches of animals and men by\r\nPalæolithic man, were executed only toward the close of the Reindeer\r\nperiod—for this explanation would be a very lame one indeed, in view of\r\nthe Geologists’ ignorance of even the approximate duration of periods.\r\n\r\nThe Esoteric Doctrine teaches distinctly the dogma of the risings and\r\nfalls of civilization; and now we learn that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is a remarkable fact that cannibalism seems to have become more\r\n    frequent as man advanced in civilization, and that while its\r\n    traces are frequent in Neolithic times they become very scarce or\r\n    altogether disappear in the age of the mammoth and the\r\n    reindeer....(1704)\r\n\r\n\r\n—another evidence of the cyclic law and the truth of our teachings.\r\nEsoteric history teaches that idols and their worship died out with the\r\nFourth Race, until the survivors of the hybrid races of the latter\r\n(Chinamen, African negroes, etc.) gradually brought the worship back. The\r\n_Vedas_ countenance no idols; all the modern Hindû writings do.\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the early Egyptian tombs, and in the remains of the pre‐\r\n    historic cities excavated by Dr. Schliemann, images of owl‐ and\r\n    ox‐headed goddesses, and other symbolical figures or idols, are\r\n    found in abundance. But when we ascend into Neolithic times, such\r\n    idols are no longer found, or, if found, it is so rarely that\r\n    archæologists still dispute as to their existence ... the only\r\n    ones which may be said with some certainty to have been idols are\r\n    one or two discovered by M. de Braye in some artificial caves of\r\n    the Neolithic period ... which appear to be intended for female\r\n    figures of life size.(1705)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd these may have been simply statues. Anyhow, all this is one among the\r\nmany proofs of the cyclic rise and fall of civilization and religion. The\r\nfact that no traces of human relics or skeletons are so far found beyond\r\nPost‐Tertiary or Quaternary times—though Abbé Bourgeois’ flints may serve\r\nas a warning(1706)—seems to point to the truth of another Esoteric\r\nstatement, which runs thus:\r\n\r\n_Seek for the remains of thy forefathers in the high places. The vales\r\nhave grown into mountains and the mountains have crumbled to the bottom of\r\nthe seas._\r\n\r\nFourth Race mankind, thinned after the last cataclysm by two‐thirds of its\r\npopulation, instead of settling on the new continents and islands that\r\n_reäppeared_—while their predecessors formed the floors of new\r\noceans—deserted that which is now Europe and parts of Asia and Africa for\r\nthe summits of gigantic mountains, the seas that surrounded some of the\r\nlatter having since “retreated” and made room for the table lands of\r\nCentral Asia.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting example of this progressive march is perhaps afforded\r\nby the celebrated Kent’s Cavern at Torquay. In that strange recess,\r\nexcavated by water out of the Devonian limestone, we find a most curious\r\nrecord preserved for us in the geological memoirs of the Earth. Under the\r\nblocks of limestone, which heaped the floor of the cavern, were\r\ndiscovered, embedded in a deposit of black earth, many implements of the\r\nNeolithic period of _fairly excellent workmanship_, with a few fragments\r\nof pottery—possibly traceable to the era of the Roman colonization. There\r\nis no trace of Palæolithic man here. No flints or traces of the extinct\r\nanimals of the Quaternary period. When, however, we penetrate still deeper\r\nthrough the dense layer of stalagmite beneath the black mould into the red\r\nearth, which, of course, itself once formed the pavement of the retreat,\r\nthings assume a very different aspect. _Not one implement_ fit to bear\r\ncomparison with the _finely‐chipped weapons found in the overlying\r\nstratum_ is to be seen; only a host of the rude and lumbering little\r\nhatchets (with which the monstrous giants of the animal world were subdued\r\nand killed by little man, we have to think?) and scrapers of the\r\nPalæolithic age, mixed up confusedly with the bones of species now either\r\nextinct or emigrated, driven away by change of climate. It is the\r\nartificer of these ugly little hatchets, you see, who sculptured the\r\nreindeer over the brook, on the antler as shown above! In all cases we\r\nmeet with the same evidence that, from historic to Neolithic and from\r\nNeolithic to Palæolithic man, things slope downwards on an inclined plane\r\nfrom the rudiments of civilization to the most abject barbarism—_in Europe\r\nagain_. We are made also to face the “Mammoth age”—the extreme or earliest\r\ndivision of the Palæolithic age—in which the great rudeness of implements\r\nreaches its maximum, and the brutal (?) appearance of contemporary skulls,\r\nsuch as the Neanderthal, points to a very low type of humanity. But they\r\nmay sometimes point also to something else; to a race of men quite\r\ndistinct from our (Fifth Race) Humanity.\r\n\r\nAs said by an Anthropologist in _Modern Thought_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The theory, scientifically based or not, of Peyrère may be\r\n    considered to be equivalent to that which divided man in two\r\n    species. Broca, Virey, and a number of the French anthropologists\r\n    have recognized that the lower race of man, comprising the\r\n    Australian, Tasmanian, and Negro race, excluding the Kaffirs and\r\n    the Northern Africans, _should be placed apart_. The fact that in\r\n    this species, or rather sub‐species, the third lower molars are\r\n    usually larger than the second, and the squamosal and frontal\r\n    bones are generally united by suture, places the _Homo afer_ on\r\n    the level of being as good a distinct species as many of the kinds\r\n    of finches. I shall abstain on the present occasion from\r\n    mentioning the facts of hybridity, whereon the late Professor\r\n    Broca has so exhaustively commented. The history, in the past ages\r\n    of the world, of this race is peculiar. It has _never originated a\r\n    system of architecture or a religion of its own_.(1707)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is peculiar, indeed, as we have shown in the case of the Tasmanians.\r\nHowever it may be, _fossil_ man in Europe can neither prove nor disprove\r\nthe antiquity of man on this Earth, nor the age of his earliest\r\ncivilizations.\r\n\r\nIt is time that the Occultists should disregard any attempts to laugh at\r\nthem, scorning the heavy guns of the satire of the men of Science as much\r\nas the pop‐guns of the profane, since it is impossible, so far, to obtain\r\neither proof or disproof, while their theories can stand the test better\r\nthan can the hypotheses of the Scientists, at any rate. As to the proof of\r\nthe antiquity which they claim for man, they have Darwin himself and Lyell\r\nwith them. The latter confesses that they, the Naturalists—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Have already obtained evidence of the existence of man at so\r\n    remote a period that there has been time for many conspicuous\r\n    mammalia, once his contemporaries, to die out, and _this even\r\n    before the era of the earliest_ historical records.(1708)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a statement made by one of England’s great authorities upon the\r\nquestion. The two sentences that follow are as suggestive, and may well be\r\nremembered by students of Occultism, for with all others he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In spite of the long lapse of prehistoric ages during which he\r\n    [man] must have flourished on earth, _there is no proof of any\r\n    perceptible change in his bodily structure_. If, therefore, he\r\n    ever diverged from some unreasoning brute ancestor, we must\r\n    suppose him to have existed at a far more distant epoch, _possibly\r\n    on some continents or islands now submerged_ beneath the ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus lost continents are officially suspected. That worlds, and also\r\nraces, are periodically destroyed by fire (volcanoes and earthquakes) and\r\nwater, in turn, and are periodically renewed, is a doctrine as old as man.\r\nManu, Hermes, the Chaldæans, all antiquity, believed in this. Twice\r\nalready has the face of the Globe been changed by fire, and twice by\r\nwater, since man appeared on it. As land needs rest and renovation, new\r\nforces, and a change for its soil, so does water. Thence arises a\r\nperiodical redistribution of land and water, change of climates, etc., all\r\nbrought on by geological revolution, and ending in a final change in the\r\naxis of the Earth. Astronomers may pooh‐pooh the idea of a periodical\r\nchange in the behaviour of the Globe’s axis, and smile at the conversation\r\ngiven in the _Book of Enoch_ between Noah and his “grandfather” Enoch; the\r\nallegory is, nevertheless, a geological and an astronomical fact. There is\r\na secular change in the inclination of the Earth’s axis, and its appointed\r\ntime is recorded in one of the great Secret Cycles. As in many other\r\nquestions, Science is gradually moving toward our way of thinking. Dr.\r\nHenry Woodward, F.R.S., F.G.S., writes in the _Popular Science Review_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    If it be necessary to call in extra‐mundane causes to explain the\r\n    great increase of ice at this glacial period, I would prefer the\r\n    theory propounded by Dr. Robert Hooke in 1688; since, by Sir\r\n    Richard Phillips and others; and lastly by Mr. Thomas Belt, C.E.,\r\n    F.G.S.; namely, a slight increase in the present obliquity of the\r\n    ecliptic, a proposal in perfect accord with other known\r\n    astronomical facts, and the introduction of which involves no\r\n    disturbance of the harmony which is essential to our cosmical\r\n    condition as a unit in the great solar system.(1709)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following, quoted from a Lecture by W. Pengelly, F.R.S., F.G.S.,\r\ndelivered in March, 1885, on “The Extinct Lake of Bovey Tracey,” shows the\r\nhesitation, in the face of every evidence in favour of Atlantis, to accept\r\nthe fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Evergreen figs, laurels, palms, and ferns having gigantic rhizomes\r\n    have their existing congeners _in a sub‐tropical climate, such, it\r\n    cannot be doubted, as prevailed in __ Devonshire in Miocene\r\n    times_, and are thus calculated to suggest caution when the\r\n    _present climate_ of any district is regarded as normal.\r\n\r\n    When, moreover, Miocene plants are found in Disco Island, on the\r\n    west coast of Greenland, lying between 69° 20´ and 70° 30´ N.\r\n    lat.; when we learn that among them were two species found also at\r\n    Bovey (Sequoia couttsiæ, Quercus lyelli); when, to quote Professor\r\n    Heer, we find that “the ‘splendid evergreen’ (Magnolia\r\n    inglefieldi) ‘ripened its fruits so far north as on the parallel\r\n    of 70°’ ” (_Phil. Trans._, clix. 457, 1869); when also the number,\r\n    variety, and luxuriance of the Greenland Miocene plants are found\r\n    to have been such that, had land continued so far, some of them\r\n    would in all probability have flourished at the Pole itself, the\r\n    problem of changes of climate is brought prominently into view,\r\n    but only to be dismissed apparently with the feeling that the\r\n    _time for its solution has not yet arrived_.\r\n\r\n    It seems to be admitted on all hands that the Miocene plants of\r\n    Europe have their nearest and most numerous existing analogues in\r\n    North America, and hence arises the question: How was the\r\n    migration from one area to the other effected? Was there, as some\r\n    have believed, an Atlantis?—a continent, or an archipelago of\r\n    large islands, occupying the area of the North Atlantic. There is\r\n    perhaps nothing unphilosophical in this hypothesis; for since, as\r\n    geologists state, “the Alps have acquired 4,000, and even in some\r\n    places more than 10,000 feet of their present altitude since the\r\n    commencement of the Eocene period” (Lyell’s _Principles_, 11th\r\n    ed., p. 256, 1872), a Post‐Miocene[?] depression might have\r\n    carried the hypothetical Atlantis into almost abysmal depths. But\r\n    an Atlantis is apparently unnecessary and uncalled for. According\r\n    to Professor Oliver, “A close and very peculiar analogy subsists\r\n    between the Flora of Tertiary Central Europe and the recent Floras\r\n    of the American States and of the Japanese region; an analogy much\r\n    closer and more intimate than is to be traced between the Tertiary\r\n    and recent Floras of Europe. We find the Tertiary element of the\r\n    Old World to be intensified towards its extreme eastern margin, if\r\n    not in numerical preponderance of genera, yet in features which\r\n    especially give a character to the Fossil Flora.... This accession\r\n    of the Tertiary element is rather gradual and not abruptly assumed\r\n    in the Japan islands only. Although it there attains a maximum, we\r\n    may trace it from the Mediterranean, Levant, Caucasus, and Persia\r\n    ... then along the Himâlaya and through China.... We learn also\r\n    that during the Tertiary epoch, counterparts of Central European\r\n    Miocene genera certainly grew in North‐West America.... We note\r\n    further that the present Atlantic Islands’ Flora affords no\r\n    substantial evidence of a former direct communication with the\r\n    mainland of the New World.... The consideration of these facts\r\n    lead me to the opinion that botanical evidence does not favour the\r\n    hypothesis of an Atlantis. On the other hand, it strongly favours\r\n    the view that at some period of the Tertiary epoch North‐Eastern\r\n    Asia was united to North‐Western America, perhaps by the line\r\n    where the Aleutian chain of islands now extends.” (_Nat. Hist.\r\n    Rev._, ii. 164, 1862, Art., “The Atlantis Hypothesis in its\r\n    Botanical Aspect.”)\r\n\r\n\r\nSee, however, on these points, “Scientific and Geological Proofs of the\r\nReality of Several Submerged Continents.”\r\n\r\nBut nothing short of a pithecoid man will ever satisfy the luckless\r\nsearchers after the thrice hypothetical “missing link.” Yet, if beneath\r\nthe vast floors of the Atlantic, from the Teneriffe Pic to Gibraltar, the\r\nancient emplacement of the lost Atlantis, all the submarine strata were to\r\nbe broken up miles deep, no such skull as would satisfy the Darwinists\r\nwould be found. As Dr. C. R. Bree remarks, no missing links between man\r\nand ape having been discovered in various gravels and formations above the\r\nTertiary strata, if these forms had gone down with the continents now\r\ncovered with the sea, they might still have been found—\r\n\r\n\r\n    In those beds of contemporary geological strata which have _not_\r\n    gone down to the bottom of the sea.(1710)\r\n\r\n\r\nYet they are as fatally absent from the latter as from the former. Did not\r\npreconceptions fasten vampire‐like on man’s mind, the author of The\r\n_Antiquity of Man_ would have found a clue to the difficulty in that same\r\nwork of his, by going ten pages back (to p. 530) and reading over a\r\nquotation of his own from Professor G. Rolleston’s work. This\r\nPhysiologist, he says, suggests that as there is considerable plasticity\r\nin the human frame, not only in youth and during growth, but even in the\r\nadult, we ought not always to take for granted, as some advocates of the\r\ndevelopment theory seem to do, that each advance in physical power depends\r\non an improvement in bodily structure, for why may not _the soul, or the\r\nhigher intellectual and moral faculties play the first instead of the\r\nsecond part in a progressive scheme_?\r\n\r\nThis hypothesis is made in relation to evolution _not being entirely due_\r\nto “natural selection”; but it applies as well to the case in hand. For\r\nwe, too, claim that it is the “Soul,” or the Inner Man, that descends on\r\nEarth first, the psychic Astral, the mould on which physical man is\r\ngradually built—his Spirit, intellectual and moral faculties awakening\r\nlater on as that physical stature grows and develops.\r\n\r\n“Thus incorporeal spirits to smaller forms reduced their shapes immense,”\r\nand became the men of the Third and the Fourth Races. Still later, ages\r\nafter, appeared the men of our Fifth Race, reduced from what we should\r\ncall the still gigantic stature of their primeval ancestors, to about half\r\nthat size at present.\r\n\r\nMan is certainly _no_ special creation. He is the product of Nature’s\r\ngradual perfective work, like any other living unit on this Earth. But\r\nthis is only with regard to the human tabernacle. That which lives and\r\nthinks in man and survives that frame, the masterpiece of evolution—is the\r\n“Eternal Pilgrim,” the Protean differentiation in Space and Time of the\r\nOne Absolute “Unknowable.”\r\n\r\nIn his _Antiquity of Man_(1711) Sir Charles Lyell quotes—perhaps in rather\r\na mocking spirit—what Hallam says in his _Introduction to the Literature\r\nof Europe_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    If man was made in the image of God, he was also made in the image\r\n    of an ape. The framework of the body of him who has weighed the\r\n    stars and made the lightning his slave, approaches to that of a\r\n    speechless brute who wanders in the forests of Sumatra. Thus\r\n    standing on the frontier land between animal and angelic natures,\r\n    what wonder that he should partake of both!(1712)\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Occultist would have put it otherwise. He would say that man was indeed\r\nmade in the image of a type projected by his progenitor, the creating\r\nAngel‐Force, or Dhyân Chohan; while the wanderer of the forest of Sumatra\r\nwas made _in the image of man_, since the framework of the ape, we say\r\nagain, is the revival, the resuscitation by abnormal means, of the actual\r\nform of the Third Round and of the Fourth Round Man as well, later on.\r\nNothing is lost in Nature, _not an atom_: this is at least certain on\r\nscientific data. Analogy would appear to demand that _form_ should be\r\nequally endowed with permanency.\r\n\r\nAnd yet what do we find? Says Sir William Dawson, F.R.S.:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is farther significant that Professor Huxley, in his lectures\r\n    in New York, while resting his case as to the lower animals mainly\r\n    on the supposed genealogy of the horse, which has often been shown\r\n    to amount to no certain evidence, avoided altogether the\r\n    discussion of the origin of men from the apes, now obviously\r\n    complicated with so many difficulties that both Wallace and Mivart\r\n    are staggered by them. Professor Thomas in his recent lectures\r\n    (_Nature_, 1876), admits that there is no lower man known than the\r\n    Australian, and that there is no known link of connection with the\r\n    monkeys; and Hæckel has to admit that the penultimate link in his\r\n    phylogeny, the ape‐like man, is absolutely unknown (_History of\r\n    Creation_).... The so‐called “tallies” found with the bones of\r\n    Palæocosmic men in European caves, and illustrated in the\r\n    admirable works of Christy and Lartet, show that the rudiments\r\n    even of writing were already in possession of the oldest race of\r\n    men known to archæology or geology.(1713)\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, in Dr. C. R. Bree’s _Fallacies of Darwinism_, we read:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mr. Darwin justly says that the difference physically and, more\r\n    especially, mentally, between the lowest form of man and the\r\n    highest anthropomorphous ape, is enormous. Therefore, _the\r\n    time_—which in Darwinian evolution must be almost inconceivably\r\n    slow—must have been _enormous_ also during man’s development from\r\n    the monkey(1714). The chance, therefore, of some of these\r\n    variations being found in the different gravels or fresh‐water\r\n    formations above the tertiaries, must be very great. And yet not\r\n    one single variation, not one single specimen of a being between a\r\n    monkey and a man has ever been found! Neither in the gravel, not\r\n    the drift‐clay, nor the fresh‐water beds and gravel and drift, nor\r\n    in the tertiaries below them, has there ever been discovered the\r\n    remains of any member of the missing families between the monkey\r\n    and the man, as _assumed_ to have existed by Mr. Darwin. Have they\r\n    gone down with the depression of the earth’s surface and are they\r\n    now covered with the sea? If so, it is beyond all probability that\r\n    they should not also be found in those beds of contemporary\r\n    geological strata which have _not_ gone down to the bottom of the\r\n    sea; still more improbable that some portions should not be\r\n    dredged from the ocean‐bed like the remains of the mammoth and the\r\n    rhinoceros, which are also found in fresh‐water beds and gravel\r\n    and drift!... The celebrated Neanderthal skull, about which so\r\n    much has been said, belongs confessedly to this remote period\r\n    [bronze and stone ages], and yet presents, although it may have\r\n    been the skull of an idiot, immense differences from the highest\r\n    known anthropomorphous ape.(1715)\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Globe being convulsed each time that it _reäwakens_ for a new period\r\nof activity, like a field which has to be ploughed and furrowed before\r\nfresh seed for its new crop is thrown into it—it does seem quite hopeless\r\nthat fossils belonging to its previous Rounds should be found in the beds\r\nof either its oldest or its latest geological strata. Every new Manvantara\r\nbrings along with it the renovation of forms, types and species; every\r\ntype of the preceding organic forms—vegetable, animal and human—changes\r\nand is perfected in the next, even to the mineral, which has received in\r\nthis Round its final opacity and hardness; its softer portions formed the\r\npresent vegetation; the astral relics of previous vegetation and fauna\r\nwere utilized in the formation of the lower animals, and in determining\r\nthe structure of the primeval Root‐Types of the highest mammalia. And,\r\nfinally, the form of the gigantic ape‐man of the former Round has been\r\nreproduced in this one by human bestiality, and transfigured into the\r\n_parent_ form in the modern anthropoid.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine, even imperfectly delineated as it is under our inefficient\r\npen, is assuredly more logical, more consistent with facts, and _far more_\r\nprobable, than many “scientific” theories; that, for instance, of the\r\nfirst organic germ descending on a meteor to our Earth—like Ain Suph on\r\nits Vehicle, Adam Kadmon. Only, the latter descent is allegorical, as\r\nevery one knows, and the Kabalists have never offered this figure of\r\nspeech for acceptance in its dead‐letter garb. But the germ‐in‐the‐meteor\r\ntheory, as coming from such high scientific quarters, is an eligible\r\ncandidate for axiomatic truth and law, a theory people are in honour bound\r\nto accept, if they would be on a right level with Modern Science. What the\r\nnext theory necessitated by the materialistic premisses will be—no one can\r\ntell. Meanwhile, the _present_ theories, as anyone can see, clash far more\r\ndiscordantly among themselves than even with those of the Occultists\r\noutside the sacred precincts of learning. For what is there, next in\r\norder, now that exact Science has made even of the life‐principle an empty\r\nword, a meaningless term, and insists that life is an effect _due to the\r\nmolecular action of the primordial protoplasm_? The new doctrine of the\r\nDarwinists may be defined and summarized in the few words, from Mr.\r\nHerbert Spencer:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The hypothesis of special creations turns out to be\r\n    worthless—worthless, by its derivation; worthless, in its\r\n    intrinsic incoherence; worthless, as absolutely without evidence;\r\n    worthless, as not supplying an intellectual need; worthless, as\r\n    not satisfying a moral want. We must, therefore, consider it as\r\n    counting for nothing in opposition to any other hypothesis\r\n    respecting the origin of organic beings.(1716)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection V. Organic Evolution and Creative Centres.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is argued that Universal Evolution, otherwise the gradual development\r\nof species in all the kingdoms of Nature, works by uniform laws. This is\r\nadmitted, and the law is enforced far more strictly in Esoteric than in\r\nModern Science. But we are also told, that it is equally a law that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Development works from the less to the more perfect, and from the\r\n    simpler to the more complicated, by incessant changes, small in\r\n    themselves, but constantly accumulating in the required\r\n    direction(1717).\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is from the infinitesimally small that the comparatively gigantic\r\nspecies are produced.\r\n\r\nEsoteric Science agrees with this, but adds that this law applies only to\r\nwhat is known to it as the Primary Creation—the evolution of Worlds from\r\nPrimordial Atoms, and the Pre‐primordial ATOM, at the first\r\ndifferentiation of the former; and that during the period of cyclic\r\nevolution in Space and Time, this law is limited and works only in the\r\nlower kingdoms. It did so work during the first geological periods, from\r\nsimple to complex, on the rough material surviving from the relics of the\r\nThird Round, which relics are projected into objectivity when terrestrial\r\nactivity recommences.\r\n\r\nNo more than Science, does the Esoteric Philosophy admit “design” or\r\n“special creation.” It rejects every claim to the “miraculous,” and\r\naccepts nothing outside the uniform and immutable laws of Nature. But it\r\nteaches a cyclic law, a double stream of Force (or Spirit) and of Matter,\r\nwhich, starting from the Neutral Centre of Being, develops by its cyclic\r\nprogress and incessant transformations. The primitive germ from which all\r\nvertebrate life has developed throughout the ages, being distinct from the\r\nprimitive germ from which vegetable and animal life have evolved, there\r\nare side laws whose work is determined by the conditions in which the\r\nmaterials to be worked upon are found by them, and of which\r\nScience—Physiology and Anthropology especially—seems to be little aware.\r\nIts votaries speak of this “primitive germ,” and maintain that it is shown\r\nbeyond any doubt that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The design [and the “designer”], if there be any [in the case of\r\n    man, with the wonderful structure of his limbs, and his hand\r\n    especially], must be placed very much farther back, and is, in\r\n    fact, involved in the primitive germ, from which all vertebrate\r\n    life certainly, and probably all life, animal or vegetable, have\r\n    been slowly developed.(1718)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is as true of the “primitive germ” as it is false that that “germ” is\r\nonly “very much farther back” than man is; for it is at an immeasurable\r\nand inconceivable distance, _in Time_, though not in Space, from the\r\norigin even of our Solar System. As the Hindû philosophy very justly\r\nteaches, the “Aniyâmsam Anîyasâm,” can be known only through false\r\nnotions. It is the “Many” that proceed from the “One”—the living spiritual\r\ngerms _or centres of forces_—each in a septenary form, which first\r\ngenerate, and then give the primary impulse to the law of evolution and\r\ngradual slow development.\r\n\r\nLimiting the teaching strictly to this our Earth, it may be shown that, as\r\nthe ethereal forms of the first Men are first projected on seven zones by\r\nseven Dhyân‐Chohanic Centres of Force, so there are centres of creative\r\npower for every root or parent species of the host of forms of vegetable\r\nand animal life. This is, again, no “special creation,” nor is there any\r\n“design,” except in the general “ground‐plan” worked out by the Universal\r\nLaw. But there are certainly “designers,” though these are neither\r\nomnipotent nor omniscient in the absolute sense of the term. They are\r\nsimply Builders, or Masons, working under the impulse given them by the\r\never‐to‐be‐unknown (on our plane) Master Mason—the One Life and Law.\r\nBelonging to this sphere, they have no hand in, nor possibility of working\r\non any other, during the present Manvantara, at any rate. That they work\r\nin cycles and on a strictly geometrical and mathematical scale of\r\nprogression, is what the extinct animal species amply demonstrate; that\r\nthey act by design in the details of minor lives (of side animal issues,\r\netc.) is sufficiently proved by natural history. In the “creation” of new\r\nspecies, departing sometimes very widely from the parent stock, as in the\r\ngreat variety of the genus Felis—like the lynx, the tiger, the cat,\r\netc.—it is the “designers” who direct the new evolution by adding to, or\r\ndepriving the species of certain appendages, either needed or becoming\r\nuseless in the new environments. Thus, when we say that Nature provides\r\nfor every animal and plant, whether large or small, we speak correctly.\r\nFor it is these terrestrial Spirits of Nature, who form the aggregated\r\nNature—which, if it fails occasionally in its design, is neither to be\r\nconsidered blind, nor to be taxed with the failure; since, belonging to a\r\n_differentiated_ sum of qualities and attributes, it is in virtue of that\r\nalone _conditioned and imperfect_.\r\n\r\nWere there no such thing as evolutionary cycles, as an eternal spiral\r\nprogress into Matter with a proportionate _obscuration_ of Spirit (though\r\nthe two are one) followed by an inverse ascent into Spirit and the defeat\r\nof Matter—active and passive by turn—how could we explain the discoveries\r\nof Zoology and Geology? How is it that, on the dictum of authoritative\r\nScience, one can trace the animal life from the mollusc up to the great\r\nsea‐dragon, from the smallest land‐worm up again to the gigantic animals\r\nof the Tertiary period; and that the latter were once crossed is shown by\r\nthe fact of all those species decreasing, dwindling down and becoming\r\ndwarfed. If the seeming process of development working from the less to\r\nthe more perfect, and from the simpler to the more complex, were a\r\nuniversal law indeed, instead of being a very imperfect generalization of\r\na mere secondary nature in the great cosmic process, and if there were no\r\nsuch cycles as those claimed, then the Mesozoic fauna and flora ought to\r\nchange places with the latest Neolithic. It is the plesiosauri and the\r\nichthyosauri that we ought to find developing from the present sea‐ and\r\nriver‐reptiles, instead of these giving place to their dwarfed modern\r\nanalogies. It is, again, our old friend, the good‐tempered elephant, that\r\nwould be the fossil antediluvian ancestor, and the mammoth of the Pliocene\r\nage who would be in the menagerie; the megalonyx and the gigantic\r\nmegatherium would be found instead of the lazy sloth in the forests of\r\nSouth America, in which the colossal ferns of the carboniferous periods\r\nwould take the place of the mosses and the present trees—dwarfs, even the\r\ngiants of California, in comparison with the Titan‐trees of past\r\ngeological periods. Surely the organisms of the megasthenian world of the\r\nTertiary and the Mesozoic ages must have been _more complex and perfect_\r\nthan those of the microsthenian plants and animals of the present age? The\r\ndryopithecus, for instance, is more perfect anatomically, is more fit for\r\na greater development of brain power, than the modern gorilla or gibbon.\r\nHow is all this, then? Are we to believe that the constitution of all\r\nthose colossal land‐ and sea‐dragons, of the gigantic flying reptiles, was\r\nnot far more developed and complex than the anatomy of the lizards,\r\nturtles, crocodiles, and even of the whales—in short, of all those animals\r\nwith which we are acquainted?\r\n\r\nLet us admit, however, for argument’s sake, that all those cycles, races,\r\nseptenary forms of evolution, and the _tutti quanti_ of Esoteric teaching,\r\nare no better than a delusion and a snare. Let us agree with Science and\r\nsay that man—instead of being an imprisoned “spirit,” and his vehicle, the\r\nshell or body, a gradually perfected and now complete mechanism for\r\nmaterial and terrestrial uses, as claimed by the Occultists—is simply a\r\nmore developed animal, whose primal form emerged from one and the same\r\nprimitive germ on this Earth as the flying dragon and the gnat, the whale\r\nand the amoeba, the crocodile and the frog, etc. In this case, he must\r\nhave passed through the identical developments and through the same\r\nprocess of growth as all the other mammals. If man is an animal, _and\r\nnothing more_, a highly intellectual “ex‐brute,” he should at least be\r\nallowed to have been a gigantic mammal of his kind, a “meganthropus” in\r\nhis day. This is exactly what Esoteric Science shows to have taken place\r\nin the first three Rounds, and in this, as in most other things, it is\r\nmore logical and consistent than Modern Science. It classifies the human\r\nbody with the brute creation, and maintains it in the path of animal\r\nevolution, from first to last, while Science leaves man a parentless\r\norphan born of sires unknown, an “unspecialized skeleton” truly! And this\r\nmistake is due to a stubborn rejection of the doctrine of cycles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. The Origin And Evolution Of The Mammalia: Science And Esoteric\r\nPhylogeny.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving dealt almost exclusively with the question of the origin of man in\r\nthe foregoing criticism of Western Evolutionism, it may not be amiss to\r\ndefine the position of the Occultists with regard to the differentiation\r\nof species. The pre‐human fauna and flora have been already dealt with\r\ngenerally in the Commentary on the Stanzas, and the truth of much of\r\nmodern biological speculation has been admitted, _e.g._, the derivation of\r\nbirds from reptiles, the _partial_ truth of “natural selection,” and the\r\ntransformation theory generally. It now remains to clear up the mystery of\r\nthe origin of those first mammalian faunæ which M. de Quatrefages so\r\nbrilliantly endeavours to prove contemporary with the Homo primigenius of\r\nthe Secondary Age.\r\n\r\nThe somewhat complicated problem relating to the “Origin of Species”—more\r\nespecially of the varied groups of fossil or existing mammalian faunæ—will\r\nbe rendered less obscure by the aid of a diagram. It will then be apparent\r\nto what extent the “factors of organic evolution,” relied upon by Western\r\nBiologists,(1719) are to be considered as adequate to meet the facts. The\r\nline of demarcation between ethereo‐spiritual, astral and physical\r\nevolution must be drawn. Perhaps, if Darwinians deigned to consider the\r\npossibility of the second process, they would no longer have to lament the\r\nfact that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We are referred entirely to conjecture and inference for the\r\n    origin of the mammals!(1720)\r\n\r\n\r\nAt present the admitted chasm between the systems of reproduction of the\r\noviparous vertebrates and mammalia constitutes a hopeless crux to those\r\nthinkers who, with the Evolutionists, seek to link all existing organic\r\nforms in a continuous line of descent.\r\n\r\nLet us take, for instance, the case of the ungulate mammals, since it is\r\nsaid that in no other division do we possess such abundant fossil\r\nmaterial. So much progress has been made in this direction, that in some\r\ninstances the intermediate links between the modern and Eocene ungulates\r\nhave been unearthed; a notable example being that of the complete proof of\r\nthe derivation of the present one‐toed horse from the three‐toed\r\nanchitherium of the old Tertiary. This standard of comparison between\r\nWestern Biology and the Eastern Doctrine could not, therefore, be improved\r\nupon. The pedigree here utilized, as embodying the views of Scientists in\r\ngeneral, is that of Schmidt, based on the exhaustive researches of\r\nRütimeyer. Its _approximate_ accuracy—from the standpoint of\r\nevolutionism—leaves little to be desired:\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Ungulate Mammals]\r\n\r\n                             Ungulate Mammals\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this, the midway point of evolution, Science comes to a standstill.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The _root_ to which these two families lead back is unknown.(1721)\r\n\r\n\r\n                         [Illustration: The Root]\r\n\r\n                     The Root According to Occultism\r\n\r\n\r\nSchmidt’s diagram represents the realm explored by Western Evolutionists,\r\nthe area in which climatic influences, “natural selection,” and all the\r\nother _physical_ causes of organic differentiation are present. Biology\r\nand Palæontology find their province here in investigating the many\r\nphysical agencies which so largely contribute, as has been shown by\r\nDarwin, Spencer and others, to the “segregation of species.” But even in\r\nthis domain the sub‐conscious workings of the Dhyân‐Chohanic wisdom are at\r\nthe root of all the “ceaseless striving towards perfection,” though its\r\ninfluence is vastly modified by those purely material causes which de\r\nQuatrefages terms the “milieu” and Spencer the “environment.”\r\n\r\nThe “midway point of evolution” is that stage where the _astral_\r\nprototypes definitely begin to pass into the physical, and thus become\r\nsubject to the differentiating agencies now operative around us. Physical\r\ncausation supervenes immediately on the assumption of the “coats of\r\nskin”—_i.e._, the physiological equipment in general. The forms of men and\r\nof other mammals previous to the separation of the sexes(1722) are woven\r\nout of astral matter, and possess a structure utterly unlike that of the\r\nphysical organisms which eat, drink, digest, etc. The known physiological\r\ncontrivances requisite for these functions were almost entirely evolved\r\nsubsequently to the incipient physicalization of the seven Root‐Types out\r\nof the astral—during the “midway halt” between the two planes of\r\nexistence. Hardly had the “ground‐plan” of evolution been limned out in\r\nthese ancestral types, than there supervened the influence of the\r\naccessory terrestrial laws, familiar to us, resulting in the whole crop of\r\nmammalian species. Æons of slow differentiation were, however, required to\r\neffect this end.\r\n\r\nThe second diagram represents the domain of the purely astral prototypes\r\nprevious to their descent into gross matter. Astral matter, it must be\r\nnoted, is fourth‐state matter, having, like our gross matter, its own\r\n“protyle.” There are several protyles in Nature, corresponding to the\r\nvarious planes of matter. The two sub‐physical elemental kingdoms, the\r\nplane of mind, Manas, or fifth‐state matter, as also that of Buddhi,\r\nsixth‐state matter, are each and all evolved from one of the six protyles\r\nwhich constitute the basis of the Object‐Universe. The three “states” so‐\r\ncalled of our terrestrial matter, known as the “solid,” “liquid,” and\r\n“gaseous,” are only, in strict accuracy, _sub_‐states. As to the former\r\nreality of the descent into the physical, which culminated in\r\nphysiological man and animal, we have a palpable testimony in the fact of\r\nthe so‐called spiritualistic “materializations.”\r\n\r\nIn all these instances a complete temporary mergence of the astral into\r\nthe physical takes place. The evolution of _physiological_ man out of the\r\nastral races of the _early_ Lemurian age—the Jurassic age of Geology—is\r\nexactly paralleled by the “materialization” of “spirits” (?) in the séance\r\nroom. In the case of Professor Crookes’ “Katie King,” the presence of a\r\n_physiological_ mechanism—heart, lungs, etc.—was indubitably demonstrated!\r\n\r\nThis, in a way, is the Archetype of Goethe. Listen to his words:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Thus much we should have gained ... all the nine perfect organic\r\n    beings ... [are] formed according to an archetype which merely\r\n    fluctuates more or less in its very persistent parts and,\r\n    moreover, day by day, completes and transforms itself by means of\r\n    reproduction.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a seemingly imperfect foreshadowing of the Occult fact of the\r\ndifferentiation of species from the primal astral Root‐Types. Whatever the\r\nwhole _posse comitatus_ of “natural selection,” etc., may effect, the\r\n_fundamental unity of structural plan_ remains practically unaffected by\r\nall subsequent modifications. The “unity of type” common, in a sense, to\r\nall the animal and human kingdoms, is not, as Spencer and others appear to\r\nhold, a proof of the consanguinity of _all_ organic forms, but a witness\r\nto the essential unity of the “ground‐plan” Nature has followed in\r\nfashioning her creatures.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the case we may again avail ourselves of a tabulation of the\r\nactual factors concerned in the differentiation of species. The stages of\r\nthe process itself need no further comment here, for they follow the basic\r\nprinciples underlying organic development, and we do not need to enter on\r\nthe domain of the biological specialist.\r\n\r\nFACTORS CONCERNED IN THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES, ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE.\r\n\r\nBasic astral prototypes pass into the physical, the Dhyân‐Chohanic\r\nimpulse, constituting Lamarck’s “inherent and necessary” law of\r\ndevelopment. It lies behind all minor agencies: variation transmitted by\r\nHeredity, Natural Selection, Sexual Selection Physiological Selection,\r\nIsolation. Correlation of Growth, Adaptation to Environment. (Intelligent\r\nas opposed to Mechanical Causation.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB. The European Palæolithic Races: Whence, And How Distributed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs Science opposed to those who maintain that, down to the Quaternary\r\nperiod, the distribution of the human races was widely different from what\r\nit is now? Is Science against those who, further, maintain that the fossil\r\nmen found in Europe‐although they have almost reached a plane of sameness\r\nand unity which continues till this day, regarded from the fundamental\r\nphysiological and anthropological aspects—still differ, sometimes greatly,\r\nfrom the type of the now existing populations? The late M. Littré admits\r\nthis in an article published by him in the _Revue des Deux Mondes_ (March\r\n1st, 1859) on the Mémoire called _Antiquités Celtiques et Antediluviennes_\r\nby Boucher de Perthes (1849). Littré therein states that: (_a_) in these\r\nperiods when the mammoths, exhumed in Picardy in company with man‐made\r\nhatchets, lived in the latter region, there must have been an eternal\r\nspring reigning over all the terrestrial globe;(1723) nature was the\r\ncontrary of what it is now, and thus is left _an enormous margin for the\r\nantiquity of those __“__periods__”_; he then adds (_b_):\r\n\r\n\r\n    Spring, Professor of the Faculty of Medicine at Liège, found in a\r\n    grotto near Namur, in the mountain of Chauvaux, numerous human\r\n    bones “of a race quite distinct from ours.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSkulls exhumed in Austria offer a great analogy with those of negro races\r\nin Africa, according to Littré, while others, discovered on the shores of\r\nthe Danube and the Rhine, resemble the skulls of the Caribs and of the\r\nancient inhabitants of Peru and Chili. Still, the Deluge, whether Biblical\r\nor Atlantean, is denied. But further geological discoveries made Gaudry\r\nwrite conclusively:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Our forefathers were positively contemporaneous with the\r\n    rhinoceros tichorrhinus, the hippopotamus major.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd he added that the soil called _diluvial_ in geology—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Was formed partially at least after man’s apparition on earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon this, Littré pronounced himself finally. He then showed the\r\nnecessity, in face of “the resurrection of so many old witnesses,” of\r\nrehandling all the origins, all the durations, and added that there was an\r\nage hitherto unknown to study—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Either at the dawn of the actual epoch, or, as I believe, at the\r\n    beginning of the epoch which preceded it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe types of the skulls found in Europe are of two kinds, as is well\r\nknown: the orthognathous and the prognathous, or the Caucasian and the\r\nNegroid types—such as are now found only among the African and the lower\r\nsavage tribes. Professor Heer—who argues that the facts of Botany\r\nnecessitate the hypothesis of an Atlantis—has shown that the plants of the\r\nNeolithic lake‐villagers are mainly of African origin. How did these\r\nplants appear in Europe if there were no former point of union between\r\nEurope and Africa? How many thousand years ago did the seventeen men live\r\nwhose skeletons were exhumed in the department of the Haute Garonne, in a\r\nsquatting posture near the remains of a coal fire, with some amulets and\r\nbroken crockery around them, and in company with the ursus spelæus, the\r\nelephas primigenius, the aurochs (regarded by Cuvier as a distinct\r\nspecies), the megaceros hibernicus—all antediluvian mammals? Certainly\r\nthey must have lived in a most distant epoch, but not in one which carries\r\nus further back than the Quaternary. A much greater antiquity for man has\r\nyet to be proved. Dr. James Hunt, the late President of the\r\nAnthropological Society, puts it at nine million years. This man of\r\nScience, at any rate, makes some approach to our Esoteric computation, if\r\nwe leave out of the computation the first two semi‐human, ethereal Races,\r\nand the early Third Race.\r\n\r\nThe question, however, arises—who were these Palæolithic men of the\r\nEuropean Quaternary epoch? Were they aboriginal, or were they the outcome\r\nof some immigration dating back into the unknown past? The latter is the\r\nonly tenable hypothesis, as all Scientists agree in eliminating Europe\r\nfrom the category of possible “cradles of mankind.” Whence, then, radiated\r\nthe various successive streams of “primitive” men?\r\n\r\nThe earliest Palæeolithic men in Europe—about whose origin Ethnology is\r\nsilent, and whose very characteristics are but imperfectly known, though\r\nexpatiated on as “ape‐like” by imaginative writers such as Mr. Grant\r\nAllen—were of pure Atlantean and “Africo”‐Atlantean stocks.(1724) (It must\r\nbe borne in mind that by this time the Atlantean Continent itself was a\r\ndream of the past.) Europe in the Quaternary epoch was very different from\r\nthe Europe of to‐day, being then only in process of formation. It was\r\nunited to Northern Africa—or rather to what is now Northern Africa—by a\r\nneck of land running across the present Straits of Gibraltar—Northern\r\nAfrica thus constituting as it were an extension of the present Spain,\r\nwhile a broad sea filled the great basin of the Sahara. Of the vast\r\nAtlantis, the main bulk of which sank in the Miocene, there remained only\r\nRuta and Daitya and a stray island or so. The Atlantean connections of the\r\nforefathers(1725) of the Palæolithic cave‐men are evidenced by the\r\nupturning of fossil skulls in Europe, reverting closely to the type of the\r\nWest Indian Carib and ancient Peruvian—a mystery indeed for all those who\r\nrefuse to sanction the “hypothesis” of a former Atlantic continent to\r\nbridge what is now an ocean. What are we also to make of the fact that\r\nwhile de Quatrefages points to that “magnificent race,” the tall Cro‐\r\nMagnon cave‐men, and to the Guanches of the Canary Islands, as\r\nrepresentatives of one type, Virchow also allies the Basques with the\r\nlatter in a similar way? Professor Retzius independently proves the\r\nrelationship of the aboriginal American dolichocephalous tribes and these\r\nsame Guanches. The several links in the chain of evidence are thus\r\nsecurely joined together. Legions of similar facts could be adduced. As to\r\nthe African tribes—themselves diverging offshoots of Atlanteans modified\r\nby climate and conditions—they crossed into Europe over the peninsula\r\nwhich made the Mediterranean an inland sea. Fine races were many of these\r\nEuropean cave‐men, as the Cro‐Magnon, for instance. But, as was to be\r\nexpected, _progress is almost non‐existent_ through the whole of the vast\r\nperiod allotted by Science to the Chipped‐Stone age.(1726) _The cyclic\r\nimpulse downwards_ weighs heavily on the stocks thus transplanted—the\r\nincubus of the Atlantean Karma is upon them. Finally, Palæolithic man\r\nmakes room for his successor—and disappears almost entirely from the\r\nscene. Professor André Lefèvre asks in this connection:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Has the Polished succeeded the Chipped‐Stone Age by an\r\n    imperceptible transition, or was it due to an invasion of\r\n    brachycephalous Kelts? But whether the deterioration produced in\r\n    the populations of La Vézère was the result of violent crossings,\r\n    or of a general retreat northwards in the wake of the reindeer, is\r\n    of little moment to us.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe continues:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Meantime the bed of the ocean has been upheaved, Europe is now\r\n    fully formed, her flora and fauna are fixed. With the taming of\r\n    the dog begins the pastoral life. We enter on those polished stone\r\n    and bronze periods, which succeed each other at irregular\r\n    intervals, which even overlap one another in the midst of ethnical\r\n    migrations and fusions, at once more confused and of shorter\r\n    duration than less advanced and more rudimentary ages. The\r\n    primitive European populations are interrupted in their special\r\n    evolution, and without perishing, become absorbed in other races,\r\n    engulfed, as it were, by the successive waves of migration\r\n    overflowing from Africa, possibly from a lost Atlantis [? far too\r\n    late by æons of years] and from prolific Asia. On the one hand\r\n    came the Iberians, on the other Pelasgians, Ligurians, Sicanians,\r\n    Etruscans—all forerunners of the great Âryan Invasion [Fifth\r\n    Race].(1727)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection VI. Giants, Civilizations, and Submerged Continents Traced in\r\nHistory.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen statements such as are comprised in the above heading are brought\r\nforward, the writer is, of course, expected to furnish _historical_\r\ninstead of _legendary_ evidence in support of such claims. Is this\r\npossible? Yes; for evidence of such a nature is plentiful, and has simply\r\nto be collected and brought together in order to become overwhelming in\r\nthe eyes of the unprejudiced.\r\n\r\nOnce the sagacious student gets hold of the guiding thread he may find out\r\nsuch evidence for himself. We give _facts_ and show landmarks; let the\r\nwayfarer follow them. What is adduced here is amply sufficient for _this_\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Voltaire, Bailly finds it quite natural that the sympathies\r\nof the “grand old invalid of Ferney” should be attracted to the\r\nrepresentatives of “knowledge and wisdom,” the ancient Brâhmans. He then\r\nadds a curious statement. He says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    But your Brâhmans are very young in comparison with their archaic\r\n    instructors.(1728)\r\n\r\n\r\nBailly, who knew nought of the Esoteric teachings, nor of Lemuria,\r\nbelieved, nevertheless, unreservedly in the lost Atlantis, and also in\r\nseveral pre‐historic and civilized nations which had disappeared without\r\nleaving any undeniable trace. He had studied the ancient classics and\r\n_traditions_ extensively, and he saw that the Arts and Sciences known to\r\nthose we now call the “ancients,” were—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Not the achievements of any of the now or even then existing\r\n    nations, nor of any of the historical peoples of Asia....\r\n\r\n\r\nand that, notwithstanding the learning of the Hindûs, their undeniable\r\npriority in the early part of their race had to be referred to a people or\r\na race still more ancient and more learned than were even the Brâhmans\r\nthemselves.(1729)\r\n\r\nVoltaire, the greatest sceptic of his day, the materialist _par\r\nexcellence_, shared Bailly’s belief. He thought it quite likely that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Long before the empires of China and India, there had been nations\r\n    cultured, learned, and powerful, which a deluge of barbarians\r\n    overpowered and thus replunged into their primitive state of\r\n    ignorance and savagery, or what they call the state of pure\r\n    nature.(1730)\r\n\r\n\r\nThat which with Voltaire was the shrewd conjecture of a great intellect,\r\nwas with Bailly a “question of historical facts.” For, he wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I make great case of ancient traditions preserved through a long\r\n    series of generations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt _was_ possible, he thought, that a _foreign_ nation should, after\r\ninstructing another nation, so disappear that it should leave no traces\r\nbehind. When asked how it could have happened that this ancient, or rather\r\narchaic, nation should not have left at least some recollection in the\r\nhuman mind, he answered that Time was a pitiless devourer of facts and\r\nevents. But the history of the Past was never entirely lost, for the Sages\r\nof old Egypt had preserved it, and “it is so preserved to this day\r\nelsewhere.” The priests of Saïs said to Solon, according to Plato:\r\n\r\n\r\n    You are unacquainted with that most noble and excellent race of\r\n    men, who once inhabited your country, from whom you and your whole\r\n    present state are descended,(1731) though only a small remnant of\r\n    this admirable people is now remaining.... These writings relate\r\n    what a prodigious force your city once overcame, when a mighty\r\n    warlike power, rushing from the Atlantic sea, spread itself with\r\n    hostile fury over all Europe and Asia.(1732)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Greeks were but the dwarfed and weak remnant of that once glorious\r\nnation.(1733)\r\n\r\nWhat was this nation? The Secret Doctrine teaches that it was the latest\r\nseventh sub‐race of the Atlantean, already swallowed up in one of the\r\nearly sub‐races of the Âryan stock, one that had been gradually spreading\r\nover the continent and islands of Europe, as soon as they had begun to\r\nemerge from the seas. Descending from the high plateaux of Asia, where the\r\ntwo races had sought refuge in the days of the agony of Atlantis, it had\r\nbeen slowly settling and colonizing the freshly emerged lands. The\r\nimmigrant sub‐race had rapidly increased and multiplied on that virgin\r\nsoil; had divided into many family races, which in their turn divided into\r\nnations. Egypt and Greece, the Phœnicians, and the Northern stocks, had\r\nthus proceeded from that one sub‐race. Thousands of years later, other\r\nraces—the remnants of the Atlanteans—“yellow and red, brown and black,”\r\nbegan to invade the new continent. There were wars in which the new comers\r\nwere defeated, and they fled, some to Africa, others to remote countries.\r\nSome of these lands became islands in course of time, owing to new\r\ngeological convulsions. Being thus forcibly separated from the continents,\r\nthe result was that the undeveloped tribes and families of the Atlantean\r\nstock fell gradually into a still more abject and savage condition.\r\n\r\nDid not the Spaniards in the Cibola expeditions meet with _white_ savage\r\nchiefs; and has not the presence of African negro types in Europe in the\r\npre‐historic ages been now ascertained? It is this presence of a foreign\r\ntype associated with that of the negro, and also with that of the\r\nMongolian, which is the stumbling‐block of Anthropology. The individual\r\nwho lived at an incalculably distant period at La Naulette, in Belgium, is\r\nan example. Says an Anthropologist:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The caves on the banks of the Lesse, in South‐Eastern Belgium,\r\n    afford evidence of what is, perhaps, the lowest man, as shown by\r\n    the Naulette jaw. Such man, however, had amulets of stone,\r\n    perforated for the purpose of ornament; these are made of a\r\n    psammite now found in the basin of the Gironde.(1734)\r\n\r\n\r\nThus Belgian man was extremely ancient. The man who was antecedent to the\r\ngreat flood of waters—which covered the highlands of Belgium with a\r\ndeposit of lehm or upland gravel thirty metres above the level of the\r\npresent rivers—must have combined the characters of the Turanian and the\r\nNegro. The Canstadt, or La Naulette, man may have been black, and he had\r\nnothing to do with the Âryan type whose remains are contemporary with\r\nthose of the cave bear at Engis. The denizens of the Aquitaine bone‐caves\r\nbelong to a far later period of history, and may not be as ancient as the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\nIf the statement be objected to on the ground that Science does not deny\r\nthe presence of man on Earth from an enormous antiquity, though that\r\nantiquity cannot be determined, since such presence is conditioned by the\r\nduration of geological periods, the age of which is not ascertained; if it\r\nis argued that the Scientists object most decidedly to the claim that man\r\npreceded the animals, for instance; or that civilization dates from the\r\nearliest Eocene period; or again, that there have ever existed giants,\r\nthree‐eyed and four‐armed and four‐legged men, androgynes, etc.—then the\r\nobjectors are asked in their turn, “How do you know? What proof have you\r\nbesides your personal hypotheses, each of which may be upset any day by\r\nnew discoveries?” And these future discoveries are sure to prove that,\r\nwhatever this earlier type of man known to Anthropologists may have been\r\nin complexion, he was in no respect _apish_. The Canstadt man, the Engis\r\nman, alike possessed essentially human attributes.(1735) People have\r\nlooked for the missing link at the wrong end of the chain; and the\r\nNeanderthal man has long since been dismissed to the “limbo of all hasty\r\nblunders.” Disraeli divided man into the associates of the apes and the\r\nangels. Reasons are here given in favour of an “angelic theory”—as\r\nChristians would call it, as applicable to at least some of the races of\r\nmen. At all events, if man be held to exist only since the Miocene period,\r\neven then humanity as a whole could not be composed of the abject savages\r\nof the Palæolithic age, as they are now represented by the Scientists. All\r\nthey say is mere arbitrary speculative guess‐work, invented by them to\r\nanswer to, and fit in with, their own fanciful theories.\r\n\r\nWe speak of events hundreds of thousands of years old, nay, even millions\r\nof years old—if man date from the geological periods(1736)—not of any of\r\nthose events which happened during the few thousand years of the pre‐\r\nhistoric margin allowed by timid and ever‐cautious history. Yet there are\r\nmen of Science who are almost of our way of thinking. From the brave\r\nconfession of the Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg, who says that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Traditions, whose traces recur in Mexico, in Central America, in\r\n    Peru, and in Bolivia, suggest the idea that man existed in these\r\n    different countries at the time of the gigantic upheaval of the\r\n    Andes, and that he has retained the memory of it—\r\n\r\n\r\ndown to the latest Palæontologists and Anthropologists, the majority of\r\nscientific men is in favour of just such an antiquity. _Àpropos_ of Peru,\r\nhas any satisfactory attempt been made to determine the ethnological\r\naffinities and characteristics of the race which reared those Cyclopean\r\nerections, the ruins of which display the relics of a great civilization?\r\nAt Cuelap, for instance, such are found, consisting—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Of a wall of wrought stones, 3,600 feet long, 560 broad, and 150\r\n    feet high, constituting a solid mass with a level summit. On this\r\n    mass was another, 600 feet long, 500 broad, and 150 feet high,\r\n    making an aggregate height of 300 feet. In it were rooms and\r\n    cells.(1737)\r\n\r\n\r\nA most suggestive fact is the _startling resemblance between the\r\narchitecture of these colossal buildings and that of the archaic European\r\nnations_. Mr. Fergusson regards the analogies between the ruins of “Inca”\r\ncivilization and the Cyclopean remains of the Pelasgians in Italy and\r\nGreece, as a coincidence—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The most remarkable in the history of architecture.... It is\r\n    difficult to resist the conclusion that there may be some relation\r\n    between them.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “relation” is simply explained by the derivation of the stocks who\r\ndevised these erections, from a common centre in an Atlantic continent.\r\nThe acceptance of the latter can alone assist us to approach a solution of\r\nthis and similar problems in almost every branch of Modern Science.\r\n\r\nDr. Lartet, treating upon the subject, settles the question by declaring\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The truth, so long contested, of the coëxistence of man with the\r\n    great extinct species [elephas primigenius, rhinoceros\r\n    tichorrhinus, hyæna spelæa, ursus spelæus, etc.], appears to me to\r\n    be henceforth unassailable and definitely conquered by\r\n    science.(1738)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is shown elsewhere that such is also de Quatrefages’ opinion. He says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Man has in all probability seen Miocene times(1739) and\r\n    consequently the entire Pliocene epoch. Are there any reasons for\r\n    believing that his traces will be found further back still?... He\r\n    may then have been contemporaneous with the earliest mammalia, and\r\n    go back as far as the Secondary period.(1740)\r\n\r\n\r\nEgypt is far older than Europe as now traced on the map. Atlanto‐Âryan\r\ntribes began to settle on it when the British Islands(1741) and France\r\nwere not even in existence. It is well known that “the tongue of the\r\nÆgyptian Sea,” or the Delta of lower Egypt, became firm land very\r\ngradually, and followed the highlands of Abyssinia; unlike the latter,\r\nwhich arose suddenly, comparatively speaking, it was very slowly formed,\r\nthrough long ages, from successive layers of sea‐slime and mud, deposited\r\nannually by the soil brought down by a large river, the present Nile. Yet\r\neven the Delta, as a firm and fertile land, has been inhabited for more\r\nthan 100,000 years. Later tribes, with still more Âryan blood in them than\r\ntheir predecessors, arrived from the East, and _conquered_ it from a\r\npeople whose very name is lost to posterity, except in the Secret Books.\r\nIt is this natural barrier of slime, which sucked in slowly and surely\r\nevery boat that approached those inhospitable shores, that was, till\r\nwithin a few thousand years B.C., the best safeguard of the later\r\nEgyptians, who had managed to reach it through Arabia, Abyssinia, and\r\nNubia, led on by Manu Vînâ in the day of Vishvâmitra.(1742)\r\n\r\nSo evident does the antiquity of man become with every day, that even the\r\nChurch is preparing for an _honourable_ surrender and retreat. The learned\r\nAbbé Fabre, professor at the Sorbonne, has categorically declared that\r\npre‐historic Palæontology and Archæology may, without any harm to the\r\nScriptures, discover in the Tertiary beds as many traces as they please of\r\nPre‐Adamite man.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Since it disregards all creations anterior to the last deluge but\r\n    one [that which produced the diluvium, according to the Abbé],\r\n    Bible revelation leaves us free to admit the existence of man in\r\n    the grey diluvium, in Pliocene, and even Eocene strata. On the\r\n    other hand, however, geologists are not all agreed on regarding\r\n    the men who inhabited the globe in these primitive ages as our\r\n    ancestors.(1743)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day on which the Church shall find that its only salvation lies in the\r\nOccult interpretation of the _Bible_ may not be so far off as some\r\nimagine. Already many an Abbé and ecclesiastic has become an ardent\r\nKabalist, and as many appear publicly in the arena, breaking a lance with\r\nTheosophists and Occultists in support of the metaphysical interpretation\r\nof the _Bible_. But they commence, unfortunately for them, at the wrong\r\nend. They are advised, before they begin to speculate upon the\r\n_metaphysical_ in their Scriptures, to study and master that which relates\r\nto the purely _physical_—_e.g._, its hints on Geology and Ethnology. For\r\nsuch allusions to the septenary constitution of the Earth and Man, to the\r\nseven Rounds and Races, abound in the _New_ as in the _Old Testament_, and\r\nare as visible as the Sun in the heavens to him who reads both\r\nsymbolically. To what do the laws in chapter xxiii of _Leviticus_ apply?\r\nWhat is the philosophy of reason for all such hebdomadal offerings and\r\nsymbolical calculations as:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ye shall count ... from the morrow after the Sabbath ... that ye\r\n    brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven Sabbaths shall be\r\n    complete.... And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without\r\n    blemish, etc.(1744)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall be contradicted, no doubt, when we say that all these “wave” and\r\n“peace” offerings were in commemoration of the _seven_ “Sabbaths” of the\r\nMysteries. These Sabbaths are seven Pralayas between seven Manvantaras, or\r\nwhat we call Rounds; for “Sabbath” is an elastic word, meaning a period of\r\nrest of whatever nature, as explained elsewhere. And if this is not\r\nsufficiently conclusive, then we may turn to the verse which adds:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Even unto the morrow after the seventh Sabbath shall ye number\r\n    fifty days [forty‐nine, 7 × 7, stages of activity, and forty‐nine\r\n    stages of rest, on the seven Globes of the Chain, and then comes\r\n    the rest of Sabbath, the _fiftieth_]; and ye shall offer _a new\r\n    meat offering_ unto the Lord.(1745)\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is, ye shall make an offering of your flesh or “coats of skin,” and,\r\ndivesting yourselves of your bodies, ye shall remain pure spirits. This\r\nlaw of offering, degraded and materialized with ages, was an institution\r\nthat dated from the earliest Atlanteans; it came to the Hebrews _viâ_ the\r\n“Chaldees,” who were the “wise men” of a _caste_, not of a nation, a\r\ncommunity of great Adepts come from their “Serpent‐holes,” who had settled\r\nin Babylonia ages before. And if this interpretation from _Leviticus_\r\n(full of the disfigured _Laws of Manu_) is found too far‐fetched, then\r\nturn to _Revelation_. Whatever interpretation profane mystics may give to\r\nthe famous chapter xvii, with its riddle of the woman in purple and\r\nscarlet; whether Protestants nod at the Roman Catholics, when reading\r\n“Mystery, Babylon the Great, the Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the\r\nEarth,” or Roman Catholics glare at the Protestants, the Occultists\r\npronounce, in their impartiality, that these words have applied from the\r\nfirst _to all and every exoteric_ Churchianity—“ceremonial magic” of old,\r\nwith its terrible effects, and now the harmless, because distorted, farce\r\nof ritualistic worship. The “mystery” of the woman and of the beast, are\r\nthe symbols of soul‐killing Churchianity and of Superstition.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The beast that ... was, and is not, ... and yet is. And here is\r\n    the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains\r\n    [seven Continents and seven Races] on which the woman sitteth—\r\n\r\n\r\nthe symbol of all the exoteric, barbarous, idolatrous faiths which have\r\ncovered that symbol “with the blood of the saints and the blood of the\r\nmartyrs” who protested and do protest.\r\n\r\n\r\n    And there are seven kings [seven Races]; five are fallen [our\r\n    Fifth Race included], and one is [the Fifth continues], and the\r\n    other [the Sixth and the Seventh Races] is not yet come; and when\r\n    he [the Race “king”] cometh, he must continue a short space.(1746)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many such apocalyptic allusions, but the student has to find\r\nthem out for himself.\r\n\r\nIf the _Bible_ combines with Archæology and Geology to show that human\r\ncivilization has passed through three more or less distinct stages, in\r\nEurope at least; and if man, both in America and Europe, as much as in\r\nAsia, dates from geological epochs—why should not the statements of _The\r\nSecret Doctrine_ be taken into consideration? Is it more philosophical or\r\nlogical and scientific to _disbelieve_, with Mr. Albert Gaudry, in Miocene\r\nman, while believing that the famous Thenay flints(1747) “were carved by\r\nthe dryopithecus monkey”; or, with the Occultist, that the\r\nanthropomorphous monkey came ages after man? For if it is once conceded,\r\nand even scientifically demonstrated, that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    There was not in the middle of the Miocene epoch a single species\r\n    of mammal identical with species now extant(1748)\r\n\r\n\r\n—and that man was then just as he is now; only taller, and more athletic\r\nthan we are(1749)—then where is the difficulty? That they could hardly be\r\nthe descendants of monkeys, which are themselves not traced before the\r\nMiocene epoch,(1750) is, on the other hand, testified to by several\r\neminent Naturalists:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Thus, in the savage of quaternary ages, who had to fight against\r\n    the mammoth with stone weapons for arms, we find all those\r\n    craniological characters generally considered as the sign of great\r\n    intellectual development.(1751)\r\n\r\n\r\nUnless man emerged spontaneously, endowed with all his intellect and\r\nwisdom, from his brainless catarrhine ancestor, he could not have acquired\r\nsuch brain within the limits of the Miocene period, if we are to believe\r\nthe learned Abbé Bourgeois.\r\n\r\nAs to the matter of giants, though the tallest man hitherto found in\r\nEurope among fossils is the “Mentone man” (6ft. 8in.), others may yet be\r\nexcavated. Nilsson, quoted by Lubbock, states that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In a tomb of the Neolithic age ... a skeleton of extraordinary\r\n    size was found in 1807.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was attributed to a king of Scotland, Albus McGaldus.\r\n\r\nAnd if in our own day we occasionally find men and women from 7ft. to even\r\n9ft. and 11 ft. high, this only proves—on the law of atavism, or the\r\nreäppearance of ancestral features of character—that there was a time when\r\n9ft. and 10ft. was the average height of humanity, even in our latest\r\nIndo‐European race.\r\n\r\nBut as the subject has been sufficiently treated elsewhere, we may pass on\r\nto the Lemurians and the Atlanteans, and see what the old Greeks knew of\r\nthese early races and what the moderns now know.\r\n\r\nThe great nation mentioned by the Egyptian priests, from which descended\r\nthe forefathers of the Greeks of the age of Troy, and which, as averred,\r\nhad fought with the Atlantic race, was then, as we see, assuredly no race\r\nof Palæolithic savages. Nevertheless, even in the days of Plato, with the\r\nexception of priests and initiates, no one seems to have preserved any\r\ndistinct recollection of the preceding races. The earliest Egyptians had\r\nbeen separated from the latest Atlanteans for ages upon ages; they were\r\nthemselves descended from an _alien_ race, and had settled in Egypt some\r\n400,000 years before,(1752) but their Initiates had preserved all the\r\nrecords. Even so late as the time of Herodotus, they had still in their\r\npossession the statues of 341 kings who had reigned over their little\r\nAtlanto‐Aryan sub‐race.(1753) If we allow only twenty years as an average\r\nfigure for the reign of each king, the duration of the Egyptian Empire has\r\nto be pushed back, from the days of Herodotus, about 17,000 years.\r\n\r\nBunsen allowed the great Pyramid an antiquity of 20,000 years. More modern\r\nArchæologists will not give it more than 5,000, or at the utmost 6,000\r\nyears, and generously concede to Thebes, with its hundred gates, 7,000\r\nyears from the date of its foundation. And yet there are records which\r\nshow Egyptian priests—Initiates—journeying in a north‐westerly direction,\r\n_by land_, _viâ_ what became later the Straits of Gibraltar; turning North\r\nand travelling through the future Phœnician settlements of Southern Gaul;\r\nthen still further North, until reaching Carnac (Morbihan) they turned to\r\nthe West again and arrived, _still travelling by land_, on the north‐\r\nwestern promontory of the New Continent.(1754)\r\n\r\nWhat was the object of their long journey? And how far back must we place\r\nthe date of such visits? The Archaic Records show the Initiates of the\r\nsecond sub‐race of the Âryan family moving from one land to the other for\r\nthe purpose of supervising the building of menhirs and dolmens, of\r\ncolossal Zodiacs in stone, and places of sepulchre to serve as receptacles\r\nfor the ashes of generations to come. When did this occur? The fact of\r\ntheir crossing from France to Great Britain _by land_ may give an idea of\r\nthe date when such a journey could have been performed on _terra firma_.\r\n\r\nIt was when:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The level of the Baltic and of the North Sea was 400 feet higher\r\n    than it is at the present day. The valley of the Somme was not\r\n    hollowed to the depth it has now attained; Sicily was joined to\r\n    Africa, Barbary to Spain. Carthage, the Pyramids of Egypt, the\r\n    palaces of Uxmal and Palenque were not yet in existence, and the\r\n    bold navigators of Tyre and Sidon, who at a later date were to\r\n    undertake their perilous voyages along the coasts of Africa, were\r\n    yet unborn. What we know with certainty is that European man was\r\n    contemporaneous with the extinct species of the quaternary epoch\r\n    ... that he witnessed the upheaval of the Alps(1755) and the\r\n    extension of the glaciers, in a word that he lived for thousands\r\n    of years before the dawn of the remotest historical traditions. It\r\n    is even possible that man was the contemporary of extinct mammalia\r\n    of species yet more ancient ... of the elephas meridionalis of the\r\n    sands of St. Prest, or at the least of the elephas antiquus,\r\n    assumed to be prior to the elephas primigenius, since their bones\r\n    are found in company with carved flints in several English caves,\r\n    associated with those of the rhinoceros hæemitechus and even of\r\n    the machairodus latidens, which is of still earlier date. M. Ed.\r\n    Lartet is also of opinion that there is nothing really impossible\r\n    in the existence of man as early as the Tertiary period.(1756)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf “there is nothing impossible” scientifically, in the idea, and it may\r\nbe admitted that man was already in existence as early as the Tertiary\r\nperiod, then it is just as well to remind the reader that Mr. Croll places\r\nthe beginning of that period 2,500,000 years back; but there was a time\r\nwhen he assigned to it 15,000,000 years.\r\n\r\nAnd if all this may be said of _European_ man, how great is the antiquity\r\nof the Lemuro‐Atlantean and of the Atlanto‐Âryan man? Every educated\r\nperson who follows the progress of Science, knows how all vestiges of man\r\nduring the Tertiary period are received. The calumnies that were poured on\r\nDesnoyers in 1863, when he announced to the Institute of France that he\r\nhad made a discovery\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the undisturbed Pliocene sands of St. Prest near Chartres,\r\n    proving the coëxistence of man and the elephas meridionalis—\r\n\r\n\r\nwere equal to the occasion. The later discovery, in 1867, by the Abbé\r\nBourgeois, that man lived in the Miocene epoch, and the reception it was\r\ngiven at the Pre‐historic Congress held at Brussels in 1872, proves that\r\nthe average man of Science will see _only that which he wishes to\r\nsee_.(1757)\r\n\r\nThe modern Archæologist, though speculating _ad infinitum_ upon the\r\ndolmens and their builders, knows, in fact, nothing either of them or of\r\ntheir origin. Yet these weird and often colossal monuments of unhewn\r\nstones—which consist generally of four or seven gigantic blocks placed\r\ntogether—are strewn over Asia, Europe, America, and Africa, in groups or\r\nrows. Stones of enormous size are found placed horizontally and variously\r\nupon two, three, four, and as in Poitou, upon six and seven blocks. People\r\nname them “devil’s altars,” druidic stones, and giant tombs. The stones of\r\nCarnac in Morbihan, Brittany—nearly a mile in length and numbering 11,000\r\nranged in eleven rows—are twin sisters of those at Stonehenge. The conical\r\nmenhir of Loch‐maria‐ker, in Morbihan, measures twenty yards in length and\r\nnearly two yards across. The menhir of Champ Dolent (near St. Malo) rises\r\nthirty feet above the ground, and is fifteen feet in depth below. Such\r\ndolmens and pre‐historic monuments are met with in almost every latitude.\r\nThey are found in the Mediterranean basin; in Denmark (among the local\r\ntumuli from twenty‐seven to thirty‐five feet in height); in Shetland; in\r\nSweden, where they are called Ganggriften (or tombs with corridors); in\r\nGermany, where they are known as the giant tombs (Hünengräben); in Spain,\r\nwhere is the dolmen of Antiguera near Malaga; in Africa; in Palestine and\r\nAlgeria; in Sardinia, with the Nuraghi and Sepolture dei Giganti, or tombs\r\nof giants; in Malabar; in India, where they are called the tombs of the\r\nDaityas (Giants) and of the Râkshasas, the Men‐demons of Lankâ; in Russia\r\nand Siberia, where they are known as the Koorgan; in Peru and Bolivia,\r\nwhere they are termed the Chulpas or burial places, etc.\r\n\r\nThere is no country from which they are absent. Who built them? Why are\r\nthey all connected with serpents and dragons, with alligators and\r\ncrocodiles? Because remains of “Palæolithic man” were, it is thought,\r\nfound in some of them, and because, in the funeral mounds of America,\r\nbodies of later races were discovered with the usual paraphernalia of bone\r\nnecklaces, weapons, stone and copper urns, etc., they are, therefore,\r\nancient _tombs_! But surely the two famous mounds—one in the Mississippi\r\nvalley and the other in Ohio—known respectively as the “Alligator Mound”\r\nand the “Great Serpent Mound,” were never meant for tombs.(1758) Yet one\r\nis told authoritatively that the mounds, and the mound or dolmen builders,\r\nare all “Pelasgic” in Europe, antecedent to the Incas in America, yet not\r\nof “extremely distant times.” They are built by “no race of dolmen\r\nbuilders,” who _never existed_ save in the earlier archæological fancy\r\n(opinion of De Mortillet, Bastian, and Westropp). Finally Virchow’s\r\nopinion of the giant tombs of Germany is now accepted as an axiom. Says\r\nthat German Biologist:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The tombs alone are gigantic, and not the bones they contain.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd Archæology has but to bow and submit to the decision.(1759)\r\n\r\nThat no gigantic skeletons have been hitherto found in the “tombs” is no\r\nreason for saying that the remains of giants were never in them.\r\n_Cremation was universal_ till a comparatively recent period—some 80,000\r\nor 100,000 years ago. The real giants, moreover, were nearly all drowned\r\nwith Atlantis. Nevertheless, classical writers, as we have shown\r\nelsewhere, often speak of giant skeletons being excavated in their day.\r\nMoreover, human fossils may be counted on the fingers, as yet. No skeleton\r\never yet found is older than between 50,000 or 60,000 years,(1760) and\r\nman’s size was reduced from 15 to 10 or 12 feet, from the time of the\r\nthird sub‐race of the Âryan stock, which sub‐race—born and developed in\r\nEurope and Asia Minor under new climates and conditions—had become\r\nEuropean. Since then, as we have said, it has been steadily decreasing. It\r\nis truer, therefore, to say that the tombs alone are archaic, and not\r\nnecessarily the bodies of men occasionally found in them; and that those\r\ntombs, since they are gigantic, must have contained giants,(1761) or\r\nrather the ashes of generations of giants.\r\n\r\nNor were all such cyclopean structures intended for sepulchres. It is with\r\nthe so‐called Druidical remains, such as Carnac in Brittany and Stonehenge\r\nin Great Britain, that the travelling Initiates above alluded to had to\r\ndo. And these gigantic monuments are all symbolic records of the World’s\r\nhistory. They are not Druidical, but universal. Nor did the Druids build\r\nthem, for they were only the heirs of the cyclopean lore left to them by\r\ngenerations of mighty builders and—“magicians,” both good and bad.\r\n\r\nIt will always be a subject of regret that History, rejecting _à priori_\r\nthe actual existence of giants, has preserved to us so little of the\r\nrecords of antiquity concerning them. Yet in nearly every Mythology—which\r\nafter all _is_ Ancient History—the giants play an important part. In the\r\nold Norse Mythology, the giants, Skrymir and his brethren, against whom\r\nthe sons of the Gods fought, were potent factors in the histories of\r\ndeities and men. The modern exegesis, that makes these giants the brethren\r\nof the dwarfs, and reduces the combats of the Gods to the history of the\r\ndevelopment of the Âryan Race, will only receive credence amongst the\r\nbelievers in the Âryan theory as expounded by Max Müller. Granting that\r\nthe Turanian races were typified by the dwarfs (Dwergar), and that a dark,\r\nround‐headed, and dwarfish race was driven northward by the fair‐faced\r\nScandinavians, or Æsir, the Gods being like unto men, there still exists\r\nneither in history nor in any other scientific work any anthropological\r\nproof whatever of the existence in Time or Space of a race of giants. Yet\r\nthat such exist, relatively and _de facto_ side by side with dwarfs,\r\nSchweinfurth can testify. The Nyam‐Nyam of Africa are regular dwarfs,\r\nwhile their next neighbours, several tribes of comparatively fair‐\r\ncomplexioned Africans, are giants when confronted with the Nyam‐Nyams, and\r\nvery tall even among Europeans, for their women are all above six and a\r\nhalf feet high.\r\n\r\nIn Cornwall and in ancient Britain the traditions of these giants are, on\r\nthe other hand, excessively common; they are said to have lived even down\r\nto the time of King Arthur. All this shows that giants lived to a later\r\ndate amongst the Celtic than among the Teutonic peoples.\r\n\r\nIf we turn to the New World, we have traditions of a race of giants of\r\nTarija on the eastern slopes of the Andes and in Ecuador, who combated\r\nGods and men. These old beliefs, which term certain localities “Los Campos\r\nde los Gigantes,” the “Fields of Giants,” are always concomitant with the\r\nexistence of Pliocene mammalia and the occurrence of Pliocene raised\r\nbeaches. “All the giants are not under Mount Ossa,” and it would be poor\r\nAnthropology indeed that would restrict the traditions of giants to Greek\r\nand Bible mythologies. Slavonian countries, Russia especially, teem with\r\nlegends about the Bogaterey (mighty giants) of old; and Slavonian\r\nfolklore, most of which has served for the foundation of national\r\nhistories, the oldest songs, and the most archaic traditions, speaks of\r\nthe giants of old. Thus we may safely reject the modern theory that would\r\nmake of the Titans mere symbols standing for cosmic forces. They were real\r\nliving men, whether twenty or only twelve feet high. Even the Homeric\r\nheroes, who, of course, belonged to a far more recent period in the\r\nhistory of the races, appear to have wielded weapons of a size and weight\r\nbeyond the strength of the strongest men of modern times.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Not twice ten men the mighty bulk could raise,\r\n    Such men as live in these degenerate days.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the fossil footprints at Carson, Nevada, U.S.A., are human, they\r\nindicate gigantic men, and of their genuineness there can remain no doubt.\r\nIt is to be deplored that the modern and scientific evidence for gigantic\r\nmen should rest on footprints alone. Over and over again, the skeletons of\r\nhypothetical giants have been identified with those of elephants and\r\nmastodons. But all such blunders before the days of Geology, and even the\r\ntraveller’s tales of Sir John Mandeville, who says that he saw giants\r\nfifty‐six feet high, in India, only show that belief in the existence of\r\ngiants has never, at any time, died out of the thoughts of men.\r\n\r\nThat which is known and accepted is, that several races of gigantic men\r\nhave existed and left distinct traces. In the _Journal of the\r\nAnthropological Institute_(1762) such a race is shown as having existed at\r\nPalmyra and possibly in Midian, exhibiting cranial forms quite different\r\nfrom those of the Jews. It is not improbable that another such race\r\nexisted in Samaria, and that the mysterious people who built the stone\r\ncircles in Galilee, hewed Neolithic flints in the Jordan valley, and\r\npreserved an ancient Semitic language quite distinct from the square\r\nHebrew character, were of very large stature. The English translations of\r\nthe _Bible_ can never be relied upon, even in their modern revised forms.\r\nThey tell us of the Nephilim, translating the word by “giants,” and\r\nfurther adding that they were “hairy” men, probably the large and powerful\r\nprototypes of the later satyrs so eloquently described by patristic fancy;\r\nsome of the Church Fathers assuring their admirers and followers that they\r\nhad themselves seen these “satyrs”—some alive, others “pickled” and\r\n“preserved.” The word “giants” being once adopted as a synonym of\r\nNephilim, the commentators have since identified them with the sons of\r\nAnak. The filibusters who seized on the Promised Land found a preëxisting\r\npopulation far exceeding their own in stature, and called it a race of\r\ngiants. But the races of really gigantic men had disappeared ages before\r\nthe birth of Moses. These tall people existed in Canaan, and even in\r\nBashan, and may have had representatives in the Nabatheans of Midian. They\r\nwere of far greater stature than the undersized Jews. Four thousand years\r\nago their cranial conformation and large stature separated them from the\r\nchildren of Heber. Forty thousand years ago their ancestors may have been\r\nof still more gigantic size, and four hundred thousand years earlier they\r\nmust have been in proportion to men in our days as the Brobdingnagians\r\nwere to the Lilliputians. The Atlanteans of the middle period were called\r\nthe “Great Dragons,” and the first symbol of their tribal deities, when\r\nthe “Gods” and the Divine Dynasties had forsaken them, was that of a giant\r\nserpent.\r\n\r\nThe mystery veiling the origin and the religion of the Druids is as great\r\nas that of their supposed fanes to the modern Symbologist, but not to the\r\ninitiated Occultists. Their priests were the descendants of the last\r\nAtlanteans, and what is known of them is sufficient to allow the inference\r\nthat they were Eastern priests, akin to the Chaldæans and Indians, though\r\nlittle more. It may be inferred that they symbolized their deity as the\r\nHindûs do their Vishnu, as the Egyptians did their Mystery God, and as the\r\nbuilders of the Ohio great Serpent Mound worshipped theirs—namely under\r\nthe form of the “Mighty Serpent,” the emblem of the eternal deity Time—the\r\nHindû Kâla. Pliny called them the “Magi of the Gauls and Britons.” But\r\nthey were more than that. The author of _Indian Antiquities_ finds much\r\naffinity between the Druids and the Brâhmans of India. Dr. Borlase points\r\nto a close analogy between them and the Magi of Persia;(1763) others will\r\nsee an identity between them and the Orphic priesthood of Thrace—simply\r\nbecause they were connected, in their Esoteric Teachings, with the\r\nuniversal Wisdom Religion, and thus presented affinities with the exoteric\r\nworship of all.\r\n\r\nLike the Hindûs, the Greeks and Romans—we speak of the Initiates—the\r\nChaldees and the Egyptians, the Druids believed in the doctrine of a\r\nsuccession of “worlds,” as also in that of seven “creations” (of new\r\ncontinents) and transformations of the face of the Earth, and in a seven‐\r\nfold night and day for each Earth or Globe. Wherever the serpent with the\r\negg is found, there this tenet was surely present. Their Dracontia are a\r\nproof of it. This belief was so universal that, if we seek for it in the\r\nEsotericism of various religions, we shall discover it in all. We shall\r\nfind it among the Âryan Hindûs and Mazdeans, the Greeks, the Latins, and\r\neven among the old Jews and early Christians, whose modern stocks hardly\r\ncomprehend now what they read in their Scriptures. In the _Book of God_ we\r\nread:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The world, says Seneca, being melted and having reëntered into the\r\n    bosom of Jupiter, this god continues for some time totally\r\n    concentred in himself and remains concealed, as it were, wholly\r\n    immersed in the contemplation of his own ideas. Afterwards we see\r\n    a new world spring from him, perfect in all its parts. Animals are\r\n    produced anew. An innocent race of men is formed.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd again, speaking of a mundane dissolution as involving the destruction\r\nor death of all, he teaches us that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    When the laws of nature shall be buried in ruin, and the last day\r\n    of the world shall come, the Southern Pole shall crush, as it\r\n    falls, all the regions of Africa, and the North Pole shall\r\n    overwhelm all the countries beneath its axis. _The affrighted Sun\r\n    shall be deprived of its light_; the palace of heaven falling to\r\n    decay shall produce at once both life and death, and some kind of\r\n    dissolution shall equally seize upon all the deities, who thus\r\n    shall return into their original chaos.(1764)\r\n\r\n\r\nOne might imagine oneself reading the Paurânic account by Parâshara of the\r\ngreat Pralaya. It is nearly the same thing, idea for idea. Has\r\nChristianity nothing of the kind? It has, we say. Let the reader open any\r\nEnglish _Bible_ and read chapter iii of the Second _Epistle of Peter_, and\r\nhe will find there the same ideas:\r\n\r\n\r\n    There shall come in the last days scoffers ... saying, Where is\r\n    the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all\r\n    things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.\r\n    For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God\r\n    the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water\r\n    and in the water: whereby the world that then was, being\r\n    overflowed with water, perished: but the heavens and the earth\r\n    which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto\r\n    fire ... the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the\r\n    elements shall melt with fervent heat. Nevertheless we ... look\r\n    for new heavens and a new earth.(1765)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the interpreters choose to see in this a reference to the creation, the\r\ndeluge, and the promised coming of Christ, when they shall live in a New\r\nJerusalem in Heaven, this is no fault of “Peter.” What the writer of the\r\nEpistle meant was the destruction of this Fifth Race of ours by\r\nsubterranean fires and inundations, and the appearance of new continents\r\nfor the Sixth Root‐Race. For the writers of the Epistles were all learned\r\nin symbology if not in science.\r\n\r\nIt has been mentioned elsewhere that the belief in the septenary\r\nconstitution of our Chain was the oldest tenet of the early Iranians, who\r\ngot it from the first Zarathushtra. It is time to prove it to those Parsîs\r\nwho have lost the key to the meaning of their Scriptures. In the _Avesta_\r\nthe Earth is considered septempartite and tripartite at one and the same\r\ntime. This is regarded by Dr. Geiger as an incongruity, for the following\r\nreasons, which he calls discrepancies. The _Avesta_ speaks of the three\r\nthirds of the Earth because the _Rig Veda_ mentions:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Three earths.... Three strata or layers, one lying above the\r\n    other, are said to be meant by this.(1766)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut he is quite mistaken, as are all exoteric profane translators. The\r\n_Avesta_ has not borrowed the idea from the _Rig Veda_, but simply repeats\r\nthe Esoteric Teaching. The “three strata or layers” do not refer to our\r\nGlobe alone, but to three layers of the Globes of our Terrestrial\r\nChain—two by two, on each plane, one on the descending, the other on the\r\nascending arc. Thus, with reference to the six Spheres or Globes above our\r\nEarth, the seventh and the fourth, the Earth is _septempartite_, while\r\nwith regard to the planes over our plane—it is _tripartite_. This meaning\r\nis carried out and corroborated by the text of the _Avesta_, and even by\r\nthe speculations—most laborious and unsatisfactory guess‐work—of the\r\ntranslators and commentators. It thus follows that the division of the\r\nEarth, or rather the Earth’s Chain, into seven Karshvars is not in\r\ncontradiction with the three “zones,” if this word is read “planes.” As\r\nGeiger remarks, this septenary division is very old—the oldest of\r\nall—since the Gâthas already speak of the “septempartite earth.”(1767)\r\nFor:\r\n\r\n\r\n    According to the statements of the later Parsî Scriptures, the\r\n    _seven Kêrshvars are to be considered as completely disconnected\r\n    parts of the earth_ [which they surely are. For] between them\r\n    _there flows the ocean_, so that it is impossible, as stated in\r\n    several passages, to pass from one Kêrshvar to another.(1768)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “Ocean” is _Space_, of course, for the latter was called “Waters of\r\nSpace” before it was known as Ether. Moreover, the word Karshvar is\r\nconsistently rendered as Dvîpa, and Hvaniratha is rendered by Jambudvîpa\r\n(Neryosangh, the translator of the _Yasna_).(1769) But this fact is not\r\ntaken into account by the Orientalists, and therefore we find even such a\r\nlearned Zoroastrian and Parsî by birth as the translator of Dr. Geiger’s\r\nwork, passing unnoticed and without a word of comment sundry remarks of\r\nthe former on the “incongruities” of this kind abounding in the Mazdean\r\nScriptures. One of such “incongruities” and “coïncidences” concerns the\r\nsimilarity of the Zoroastrian with the Indian tenet with regard to the\r\nseven Dvîpas—islands, or continents, rather—as met with in the _Purânas_,\r\nnamely:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Dvîpas form concentric rings, which, separated by the ocean,\r\n    surround Jambudvîpa, which is situated in the centre, [and]\r\n    according to the Iranian view, the Kêrshvar Qaniratha is likewise\r\n    situated in the centre of the rest, they form no concentric\r\n    circles, but each of them [the six other Karshvars] is a peculiar\r\n    individual space, and so they group themselves round [above]\r\n    Qaniratha.(1770)\r\n\r\n\r\nNow Qaniratha—better Hvaniratha—is not, as believed by Geiger and his\r\ntranslator, “the country inhabited by the Irânian tribes,” and “the other\r\nnames” do not mean “the adjacent territories of foreign nations in the\r\nNorth, South, West, and East,” but signify our Globe or Earth. For that\r\nwhich is meant by the sentence which follows the last quoted, namely,\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Two, Vorubarshti and Voruzarshti, lie in the North; two,\r\n    Vidadhafshu and Tradadhafshu, in the South; Savahi and Arzahi in\r\n    the East and West\r\n\r\n\r\n—is simply the very graphic and accurate description of the Chain of our\r\nPlanet, the Earth, represented in the _Book of Dzyan_ (11) thus:\r\n\r\n                    [Illustration: The Chain of Earth]\r\n\r\nThe Mazdean names given above have only to be replaced by those used in\r\nthe Secret Doctrine to present us with the Esoteric tenet. The “Earth”\r\n(our world) _is_ tripartite, because the Chain of the Worlds is situated\r\non three different planes above our Globe; and it is septempartite because\r\nof the seven Globes or Spheres which compose the Chain. Hence the further\r\nmeaning given in _Vendidâd_ (xix. 39), showing that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Qaniratha alone is combined with _imat_, “this” (earth), while all\r\n    other Karshvares are combined with the word “_avat_,” “that” or\r\n    _those_—upper earths.\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing could be plainer. The same may be said of the modern comprehension\r\nof all other ancient beliefs.\r\n\r\nThe Druids, then, understood the meaning of the Sun in Taurus, when, all\r\nother fires being extinguished on the first of November, their sacred and\r\ninextinguishable fires alone remained to illumine the horizon, like those\r\nof the Magi and the modern Zoroastrians. And like the early Fifth Race and\r\nlater Chaldees, like the Greeks, and again like the Christians—who do the\r\nsame to this day, without suspecting the real meaning—they greeted the\r\nMorning Star, the beautiful Venus‐Lucifer.(1771) Strabo speaks of an\r\nisland near to Britannia:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Where Ceres and Persephone were worshipped with the same rites as\r\n    in Samothrace and this island was Sacred Ierna(1772)—\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere a perpetual fire was lit. The Druids believed in the rebirth of man,\r\nnot as Lucian explains:\r\n\r\n\r\n    That the same spirit shall animate a new body, not here, but in a\r\n    different world—\r\n\r\n\r\nbut in a series of reïncarnations in this same world; for as Diodorus\r\nsays, they declared that the souls of men, after determinate periods,\r\nwould pass into other bodies.(1773)\r\n\r\nThese tenets came to the Fifth Race Âryans from their predecessors of the\r\nFourth Race, the Atlanteans. They had piously preserved the teachings,\r\nwhich told them how their parent Root‐Race, becoming with every generation\r\nmore arrogant, owing to the acquisition of superhuman powers, had been\r\ngradually gliding toward its end. Those records reminded them of the giant\r\nintellect of the preceding races as well as of their giant size. We find\r\nthe repetition of those records in every age of history, in almost every\r\nold fragment which has descended to us from antiquity.\r\n\r\nÆlian preserved an extract from Theophrastus written during the days of\r\nAlexander the Great. It is a dialogue between Midas, the Phrygian, and\r\nSilenus. The former is told of a continent that had existed in times of\r\nold, so immense, that Asia, Europe and Africa seemed like poor islands\r\ncompared with it. _It was the last to produce_ animals and plants of\r\ngigantic magnitudes. There, said Silenus, men grew to double the size of\r\nthe tallest man in his (the narrator’s) time, and they lived till they\r\nwere twice as old. They had wealthy cities with temples, and one of such\r\ncities held more than a million of inhabitants in it, gold and silver\r\nbeing found there in great abundance.\r\n\r\nGrote’s suggestion that Atlantis was but a myth arisen from a\r\nmirage—clouds on a dazzling sky taking the appearance of islands on a\r\ngolden sea—is too disingenuous to be further noticed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Some Statements About The Sacred Islands And Continents In The\r\nClassics, Explained Esoterically.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll that which precedes was known to Plato, and to many others. But as no\r\nInitiate had the right to divulge and declare all he knew, posterity got\r\nonly hints. Aiming more to instruct as a Moralist than as a Geographer and\r\nEthnologist or Historian, the Greek Philosopher merged the history of\r\nAtlantis, which covered several million years, into one event which he\r\nlocated on one comparatively small island 3,000 stadia long by 2,000 wide\r\n(or about 350 miles by 200, which is about the size of Ireland); whereas\r\nthe priests spoke of Atlantis as a continent vast as “all Asia and Lybia”\r\nput together.(1774) But, however altered in its general aspect, Plato’s\r\nnarrative bears the impress of truth upon it.(1775) It was not he who\r\ninvented it, at any rate, since Homer, who preceded him by many centuries,\r\nalso speaks in his _Odyssey_ of the Atlantes—who are our Atlanteans—and of\r\ntheir island. Therefore the tradition was older than the bard of Ulysses.\r\nThe Atlantes and the Atlantides of Mythology are based upon the Atlantes\r\nand the Atlantides of History. Both Sanchuniathon and Diodorus have\r\npreserved the histories of those heroes and heroines, however much their\r\naccounts may have become mixed up with the mythical element.\r\n\r\nIn our own day we witness the extraordinary fact that such comparatively\r\nrecent personages as Shakspere and William Tell are all but denied, an\r\nattempt being made to show one to be a _nom de plume_, and the other a\r\nperson who never existed. What wonder then, that the two powerful\r\nRaces—the Lemurians and the Atlanteans—have been merged into and\r\nidentified, in time, with a few half mythical peoples, who all bore the\r\nsame patronymic.\r\n\r\nHerodotus speaks of the Atlantes—a people of Western Africa—who gave their\r\nname to Mount Atlas: who were vegetarians, and “whose sleep was never\r\ndisturbed by dreams”; and who, moreover,\r\n\r\n\r\n    Daily cursed the sun at his rising and at his setting because his\r\n    excessive heat scorched and tormented them.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese statements are based upon moral and psychic facts and not on\r\nphysiological disturbance. The story of Atlas gives the key to this. If\r\nthe Atlanteans never had their sleep disturbed by dreams, it is because\r\nthat particular tradition is concerned with the earliest Atlanteans, whose\r\nphysical frame and brain were not yet sufficiently consolidated, in the\r\nphysiological sense, to permit the nervous centres to act during sleep.\r\nWith regard to the other statement—that they daily “cursed the sun”—this\r\nagain had nothing to do with the heat, but with the moral degeneration\r\nthat grew with the Race. It is explained in our Commentaries.\r\n\r\n_They [the sixth sub‐race of the Atlanteans] used magic incantations even\r\nagainst the Sun_—\r\n\r\nfailing in which they cursed it. The sorcerers of Thessaly were credited\r\nwith the power of calling down the Moon, as Greek history assures us. The\r\nAtlanteans of the later period were renowned for their magic powers and\r\nwickedness, their ambition and defiance of the Gods. Thence the same\r\ntraditions, taking form in the _Bible_, about the antediluvian giants and\r\nthe Tower of Babel, and found also in the _Book of Enoch_.\r\n\r\nDiodorus records another fact or two: the Atlanteans boasted of possessing\r\nthe land in which all the Gods had received their birth; as also of having\r\nhad Uranus for their first King, he being also the first to teach them\r\nAstronomy. Very little more than this has come down to us from antiquity.\r\n\r\nThe myth of Atlas is an allegory easily understood. Atlas is the old\r\nContinents of Lemuria and Atlantis, combined and personified in one\r\nsymbol. The poets attribute to Atlas, as to Proteus, a superior wisdom and\r\na universal knowledge, and especially _a thorough acquaintance with the\r\ndepths of the ocean_; for both Continents bore Races instructed by\r\n_divine_ Masters, and both were transferred to the bottom of the seas,\r\nwhere they now slumber until their next reäppearance above the waters.\r\nAtlas is the son of an ocean nymph, and his daughter is Calypso—the\r\n“watery deep.” Atlantis has been submerged beneath the waters of the\r\nocean, and its progeny is now sleeping its eternal sleep on the ocean\r\nfloors. The _Odyssey_ makes of him the guardian and the “sustainer” of the\r\nhuge pillars that separate the Heavens from the Earth. He is their\r\n“supporter.” And as both Lemuria, destroyed by submarine fires, and\r\nAtlantis, submerged by the waves, perished in the ocean deeps,(1776) Atlas\r\nis said to have been compelled to leave the surface of the Earth, and join\r\nhis brother Iapetus in the depths of Tartarus.(1777) Sir Theodore Martin\r\nis right in interpreting this allegory as meaning:\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Atlas] standing on the solid floor of the inferior hemisphere of\r\n    the universe, and thus carrying at the same time the disc of the\r\n    earth and the celestial vault—the solid envelope of the superior\r\n    hemisphere.(1778)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Atlas is Atlantis, which supports the new continents and their\r\nhorizons on its “shoulders.”\r\n\r\nDecharme, in his _Mythologie de la Grèce Antique_, expresses a doubt as to\r\nthe correctness of Pierron’s translation of the Homeric word ἕχει by\r\n_sustinet_, as it is not possible to see:\r\n\r\n\r\n    How Atlas can support or bear at once several pillars situated in\r\n    various localities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Atlas were an individual it would be an awkward translation. But, as he\r\npersonifies a Continent in the West said to support Heaven and Earth at\r\nonce,(1779) _i.e._, the feet of the giant tread the earth while his\r\nshoulders support the celestial vault—an allusion to the gigantic peaks of\r\nthe Lemurian and Atlantean Continents—the epithet “supporter” becomes very\r\ncorrect. The term _conservator_ for the Greek word ἕχει, which Decharme,\r\nfollowing Sir Theodore Martin, understands as meaning φυλάσσει and\r\nἐπιμελεῖταυ, does not render the same sense.\r\n\r\nThe conception was certainly due to the gigantic mountain chain running\r\nalong the terrestrial border or disc. These mountain peaks plunged their\r\nroots into the very bottom of the seas, while they raised their heads\r\nheavenward, their summits being lost in the clouds. The ancient continents\r\nhad more mountains than valleys on them. Atlas and the Teneriffe Peak, now\r\ntwo of the dwarfed relics of the two lost Continents, were thrice as lofty\r\nduring the day of Lemuria and twice as high in that of Atlantis. Thus, the\r\nLybians called Mount Atlas the “Pillar of Heaven,” according to\r\nHerodotus,(1780) and Pindar qualified the later Ætna as the “Celestial\r\nPillar.”(1781) Atlas was an inaccessible island peak in the days of\r\nLemuria, when the African continent had not yet been raised. It is the\r\nsole Western relic which survives, _independent_, belonging to the\r\nContinent on which the Third Race was born, developed and fell,(1782) for\r\nAustralia is now part of the Eastern Continent. Proud Atlas, according to\r\nEsoteric tradition, having sunk one‐third of its size into the waters, its\r\ntwo parts remained as an heirloom of Atlantis.\r\n\r\nThis again was known to the priests of Egypt and to Plato himself, the\r\nsolemn oath of secrecy, which extended even to the mysteries of Neo‐\r\nPlatonism, alone preventing the whole truth from being told.(1783) So\r\nsecret was the knowledge of the last island of Atlantis, indeed—on account\r\nof the superhuman powers possessed by its inhabitants, the last direct\r\ndescendants of the Gods or Divine Kings, as it was thought—that to divulge\r\nits whereabouts and existence was punished by death. Theopompus says as\r\nmuch in his ever‐suspected _Meropis_, when he speaks of the Phœnicians as\r\nbeing the only navigators in the seas which wash the Western coast of\r\nAfrica; who did it with such mystery that very often they sunk their own\r\nvessels to make the too inquisitive foreigners lose all trace of them.\r\n\r\nThere are Orientalists and Historians—and they form the majority—who,\r\nwhile feeling quite unmoved at the rather crude language of the _Bible_,\r\nand some of the events narrated in it, show great disgust at the\r\n“immorality” in the Pantheons of India and Greece.(1784) We may be told\r\nthat before them Euripides, Pindar, and even Plato, express the same\r\ndisgust; that they too felt irritated with the tales invented—“those\r\nmiserable stories of the poets,” as Euripides phrases it.(1785)\r\n\r\nBut there may have been another reason for this, perhaps. To those who\r\nknew that there was more than one key to Theogonic Symbolism, it was a\r\nmistake to have expressed it in a language so crude and misleading. For if\r\nthe educated and learned Philosopher could discern the kernel of wisdom\r\nunder the coarse rind of the fruit, and knew that the latter concealed the\r\ngreatest laws and truths of psychic and physical nature, as well as the\r\norigin of all things—not so with the uninitiated profane. For him the\r\ndead‐letter was religion; the interpretation—sacrilege. And this dead‐\r\nletter could neither edify nor make him more perfect, seeing that such an\r\nexample was given him by his Gods. But to the Philosopher—especially the\r\nInitiate—Hesiod’s _Theogony_ is as historical as any history can be. Plato\r\naccepts it as such, and gives out as much of its truths as his pledges\r\npermitted.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the Atlantes claimed Uranus for their first king, and that\r\nPlato commences his story of Atlantis by the division of the great\r\nContinent by Neptune, the grandson of Uranus, shows that there were\r\ncontinents before Atlantis and kings before Uranus. For Neptune, to whose\r\nlot the great Continent fell, finds on a small island only one human\r\ncouple made of clay—_i.e._, the first physical _human_ man, whose origin\r\nbegan with the last sub‐races of the Third Root‐Race. It is their daughter\r\nClito that the God marries, and it is his eldest son Atlas who receives\r\nfor his part the mountain and the continent which were called by his\r\nname.(1786)\r\n\r\nNow all the Gods of Olympus, as well as those of the Hindû Pantheon and\r\nthe Rishis, were the septiform personations (1) of the Noumena of the\r\nIntelligent Powers of Nature; (2) of Cosmic Forces; (3) of Celestial\r\nBodies; (4) of Gods or Dhyân Chohans; (5) of Psychic and Spiritual Powers;\r\n(6) of Divine Kings on Earth, or the incarnations of the Gods; and (7) of\r\nTerrestrial Heroes or Men. The knowledge how to discern among these seven\r\nforms the one that is intended, belonged at all times to the Initiates,\r\nwhose earliest predecessors had created this symbolical and allegorical\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThus while Uranus, or the Host representing this celestial group, reigned\r\nand ruled over the Second Race and their then Continent, Cronus or Saturn\r\ngoverned the Lemurians; and Jupiter, Neptune(1787) and others fought in\r\nthe allegory for Atlantis, which was the whole Earth in the day of the\r\nFourth Race. Poseidonis, or the last island of Atlantis—the “third step”\r\nof Idas‐pati, or Vishnu, in the mystic language of the Secret Books—lasted\r\ntill about 12,000 years ago.(1788) The Atlantes of Diodorus were right in\r\nclaiming that it was their country, the region surrounding Mount Atlas,\r\nwhere “the Gods were born”—_i.e._, “incarnated.” But it was after their\r\nfourth incarnation that they became, for the first time, human kings and\r\nrulers.\r\n\r\nDiodorus speaks of Uranus as the first king of Atlantis, confusing, either\r\nconsciously or otherwise, the Continents; but as we have shown, Plato\r\nindirectly corrects the statement. The first astronomical teacher of men\r\nwas Uranus, because he is one of the seven Dhyân Chohans of that Second\r\nPeriod or Race. Thus also in the second Manvantara, that of Svârochisha,\r\namong the seven sons of the Manu, the presiding Gods or Rishis of that\r\nrace, we find Jyotis,(1789) the teacher of Astronomy (Jyotisha), one of\r\nthe names of Brahmâ. And thus also the Chinese revere Tien (or the Sky,\r\nOuranos), and name him as their first teacher of Astronomy. Uranus gave\r\nbirth to the Titans of the Third Race, and it is they, personified by\r\nSaturn‐Cronus, who mutilated him. For as it is the Titans who _fell into\r\ngeneration_, when “creation by _will_ was superseded by physical\r\nprocreation,” they needed Uranus no more.\r\n\r\nAnd here a short digression must be permitted and pardoned. In consequence\r\nof the last scholarly production of Mr. Gladstone in the _Nineteenth\r\nCentury_, “The Greater Gods of Olympos,” the ideas of the general public\r\nabout Greek Mythology have been still further perverted and biassed. Homer\r\nis credited with an inner thought, which is regarded by Mr. Gladstone as,\r\n“the true key to the Homeric conception,” whereas this “key” is merely a\r\n“blind.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Poseidon] is indeed essentially of the earth earthy ... strong\r\n    and self‐asserting, sensual and intensely jealous and vindictive—\r\n\r\n\r\nbut this is because he symbolizes the Spirit of the Fourth Root‐Race, the\r\nRuler of the Seas, that Race which lives above the surface of the\r\nseas,(1790) which is composed of the giants, the children of Eurymedon,\r\nthe race which is the father of Polyphemus, the Titan, and the one‐eyed\r\nCyclops. Though Zeus reign over the Fourth Race, it is Poseidon who rules,\r\nand who is the true key to the triad of the Cronid Brothers, and to our\r\n_human_ races. Poseidon and Nereus are _one_; the former the Ruler or\r\nSpirit of Atlantis before the beginning of its submersion, the latter,\r\nafter. Neptune is the titanic strength of the _living_ Race, Nereus, its\r\nSpirit, reïncarnated in the subsequent Fifth or Âryan Race; and this is\r\nwhat the Greek scholar of England has not yet discovered, or even dimly\r\nperceived. And yet he makes many observations upon the “artfulness” of\r\nHomer, who never names Nereus, at whose designation we arrive only through\r\nthe patronymic of the Nereids!\r\n\r\nThus the tendency of even the most erudite Hellenists is to confine their\r\nspeculations to the exoteric images of Mythology and to lose sight of\r\ntheir inner meaning; and it is remarkably illustrated in the case of Mr.\r\nGladstone, as we have shown. While almost the most conspicuous figure of\r\nour age as a statesman, he is at the same time one of the most cultured\r\nscholars to whom England has given birth. Grecian literature has been the\r\nbeloved study of his life, and he has found time amid the bustle of public\r\naffairs to enrich contemporary literature with contributions to Greek\r\nscholarship, which will make his name famous through coming generations.\r\nAt the same time, as his sincere admirer, the present writer cannot but\r\nfeel a deep regret that posterity, while acknowledging his profound\r\nerudition and splendid culture, will yet, in the greater light which\r\n_must_ then shine upon the whole question of Symbolism and Mythology,\r\njudge that he has failed to grasp the spirit of the religious system which\r\nhe has often criticized from the dogmatic Christian standpoint. In that\r\nfuture day it will be perceived that the Esoteric key to the mysteries of\r\nthe Christian as well as of the Grecian Theogonies and Sciences, is the\r\nSecret Doctrine of the pre‐historic nations, which, along with others, he\r\nhas denied. It is that doctrine alone which can trace the kinship of all\r\nhuman religious speculations, or even of so‐called “revelations,” and it\r\nis this teaching which infuses the spirit of life into the lay figures on\r\nthe Mounts of Meru, Olympus, Walhalla, or Sinai. If Mr. Gladstone were a\r\nyounger man, his admirers might hope that his scholastic studies would be\r\ncrowned by the discovery of this underlying truth. As it is, he but wastes\r\nthe golden hours of his declining years in futile disputations with that\r\ngiant free‐thinker, Col. Ingersoll, each fighting with the weapons of\r\nexoteric temper, drawn from the arsenals of ignorant Literalism. These two\r\ngreat controversialists are equally blind to the true Esoteric meaning of\r\nthe texts which they hurl at each other’s heads like iron bullets, while\r\nthe world alone suffers by such controversies; since the one helps to\r\nstrengthen the ranks of Materialism, and the other those of blind\r\nSectarianism of the dead‐letter. And now we may return once more to our\r\nimmediate subject.\r\n\r\nMany a time Atlantis is spoken of under another name, one unknown to our\r\ncommentators. The _power of names_ is great, and has been known since the\r\nfirst men were instructed by the _Divine_ Masters. And as Solon had\r\nstudied it, he translated the “Atlantean” names into names devised by\r\nhimself. In connection with the continent of Atlantis, it is desirable to\r\nbear in mind that the accounts which have come down to us from the old\r\nGreek writers contain a confusion of statements, some referring to the\r\ngreat Continent and others to the last small island of Poseidonis. It has\r\nbecome customary to take them all as referring to the latter only, but\r\nthat this is incorrect is evident from the incompatibility of the various\r\nstatements as to the size, etc., of “Atlantis.”\r\n\r\nThus, in the _Critias_, Plato says, that the plain surrounding the city\r\nwas itself surrounded by mountain chains, and the plain was smooth and\r\nlevel, and of an oblong shape, lying north and south, three thousand\r\nstadia in one direction and two thousand in the other; they surrounded the\r\nplain by an enormous canal or dike, 101 feet deep, 606 feet broad, and\r\n1,250 miles in length.(1791)\r\n\r\nNow in other places the entire size of the _island_ of Poseidonis is given\r\nas about the same as that assigned here to the “_plain_ around the city”\r\nalone. Obviously, one set of statements refers to the great Continent, and\r\nthe other to its last remnant—Plato’s island.\r\n\r\nAnd, again, the standing army of Atlantis is given as upwards of a million\r\nmen; its navy as 1,200 ships and 240,000 men. Such statements are quite\r\ninapplicable to a small island state, of about the size of Ireland!\r\n\r\nThe Greek allegories give to Atlas, or Atlantis, seven daughters—seven\r\nsub‐races—whose respective names are Maia, Electra, Taygeta, Asterope,\r\nMerope, Alcyone, and Celæno. This ethnologically—as they are credited with\r\nhaving married Gods and with having become the mothers of famous heroes,\r\nthe founders of many nations and cities. Astronomically, the Atlantides\r\nhave become the seven Pleiades (?). In Occult Science the two are\r\nconnected with the destinies of nations, those destinies being shaped by\r\nthe past events of their early lives according to Karmic Law.\r\n\r\nThree great nations claimed in antiquity a direct descent from the kingdom\r\nof Saturn or Lemuria, confused with Atlantis several thousands of years\r\nbefore our era; and these were the Egyptians, the Phœnicians\r\n(Sanchuniathon), and the old Greeks (Diodorus, after Plato). But the\r\noldest civilized country of Asia—India—can likewise be shown to claim the\r\nsame descent. Sub‐races, guided by Karmic Law or destiny, repeat\r\nunconsciously the first steps of their respective mother‐races. As the\r\ncomparatively fair Brâhmans—when invading India with its dark‐coloured\r\nDravidians—have come from the North, so the Âryan Fifth Race must claim\r\nits origin from northern regions. The Occult Sciences show that the\r\nfounders, the respective groups of the seven Prajâpatis, of the Root‐Races\r\nhave all been connected with the Pole Star. In the Commentary we find:\r\n\r\n\r\n    _He who understands the age of Dhruva_(_1792_)_ who measures 9090\r\n    mortal years, will understand the times of the Pralayas, the final\r\n    destiny of nations, O Lanoo._\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover there must have been a good reason why an Asiatic nation should\r\nlocate its great Progenitors and Saints in Ursa Major, a _northern\r\nconstellation_. It is 70,000 years, however, _since the Pole of the Earth\r\npointed to the further end of Ursa Minor’s tail_; and many more thousand\r\nyears since the seven Rishis could have been identified with the\r\nconstellation of Ursa Major.\r\n\r\nThe Âryan Race was born and developed in the far North, though after the\r\nsinking of the Continent of Atlantis its tribes emigrated further South\r\ninto Asia. Hence Prometheus is the son of Asia, and Deucalion, his son,\r\nthe Greek Noah—he who created men out of the stones of mother Earth—is\r\ncalled a northern Scythe, by Lucian, and Prometheus is made the brother of\r\nAtlas and is tied down to Mount Caucasus amid the snows.(1793)\r\n\r\nGreece had her _Hyperborean_ as well as her _Southern_ Apollo. Thus nearly\r\nall the Gods of Egypt, Greece, and Phœnicia, as well as those of other\r\nPantheons, are of a northern origin and originated in Lemuria, towards the\r\nclose of the Third Race, after its full physical and physiological\r\nevolution had been completed.(1794) All the “fables” of Greece would be\r\nfound to be built on historical facts, if that history had only passed to\r\nposterity unadulterated by myths. The “one‐eyed” Cyclopes, the giants\r\nfabled as the sons of Cœlus and Terra—three in number, according to\r\nHesiod—were the last three sub‐races of the Lemurians, the “one‐eye”\r\nreferring to the wisdom‐eye;(1795) for the two front eyes were fully\r\ndeveloped as physical organs only in the beginning of the Fourth Race. The\r\nallegory of Ulysses, whose companions were devoured while the king of\r\nIthaca himself was saved by putting out the eye of Polyphemus with a fire‐\r\nbrand, is based upon the psycho‐physiological atrophy of the “third eye.”\r\nUlysses belongs to the cycle of the heroes of the Fourth Race, and, though\r\na “Sage” in the sight of the latter, must have been a profligate in the\r\nopinion of the pastoral Cyclopes.(1796) His adventure with the latter—a\r\nsavage gigantic race, the antithesis of cultured civilization in the\r\n_Odyssey_—is an allegorical record of the gradual passage from the\r\nCyclopean civilization of stone and colossal buildings to the more sensual\r\nand physical culture of the Atlanteans, which finally caused the last of\r\nthe Third Race to lose their all‐penetrating _spiritual_ eye. The other\r\nallegory, which makes Apollo kill the Cyclopes to avenge the death of his\r\nson Asclepius, does not refer to the three sub‐races represented by the\r\nthree sons of Heaven and Earth, but to the Hyperborean Arimaspian\r\nCyclopes, the last of the race endowed with the “wisdom‐eye.” The former\r\nhave left relics of their buildings everywhere, in the South as much as in\r\nthe North; the latter were confined to the North solely. Thus Apollo—pre‐\r\neminently the God of the Seers, whose duty it is to punish desecration,\r\nkilled them—his shafts representing human passions, fiery and lethal—and\r\nhid his shaft behind a mountain in the Hyperborean regions.(1797)\r\nCosmically and astronomically this Hyperborean God is the Sun personified,\r\nwhich during the course of the Sidereal Year—25,868 years—changes the\r\nclimates on the Earth’s surface, making frigid regions of tropical, and\r\n_vice versâ_. Psychically and spiritually his significance is far more\r\nimportant. As Mr. Gladstone pertinently remarks in his “Greater Gods of\r\nOlympos”:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The qualities of Apollo (jointly with Athenê) are impossible to be\r\n    accounted for without repairing to sources, which lie beyond the\r\n    limit of the traditions most commonly explored for the elucidation\r\n    of the Greek mythology.(1798)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of Latona (Leto), Apollo’s mother, is most pregnant in various\r\nmeanings. Astronomically, Latona is the polar region and the night, giving\r\nbirth to the Sun, Apollo, Phœbus, etc. She is born in the Hyperborean\r\ncountries, wherein all the inhabitants were priests of her son,\r\ncelebrating his resurrection and descent to their country every nineteen\r\nyears at the renewal of the lunar cycle.(1799)  Latona is the Hyperborean\r\nContinent, and its Race—geologically.(1800)\r\n\r\nWhen the astronomical meaning cedes its place to the spiritual and\r\ndivine—Apollo and Athene transforming themselves into the form of “birds,”\r\nthe symbol and glyph of the higher divinities and angels—then the bright\r\nGod assumes divine creative powers. Apollo becomes the personification of\r\nseership, when he sends the astral double of Æneas to the battle\r\nfield,(1801) and has the gift of appearing to his seers without being\r\nvisible to other persons present,(1802) a gift, however, shared by every\r\nhigh Adept.\r\n\r\nThe King of the Hyperboreans was, therefore, the son of Boreas, the North\r\nWind, and the High Priest of Apollo. The quarrel of Latona with Niobe—the\r\nAtlantean Race—the mother of seven sons and seven daughters, personifying\r\nthe seven sub‐races of the Fourth Race and their seven branches(1803)\r\nallegorizes the history of the two Continents. The wrath of the “Sons of\r\nGod,” or of “Will and Yoga,” at seeing the steady degradation of the\r\nAtlanteans was great;(1804) and the destruction of the children of Niobe\r\nby the children of Latona—Apollo and Diana, the deities of light, wisdom\r\nand purity, or the Sun and Moon astronomically, whose influence causes\r\nchanges in the Earth’s axis, deluges and other cosmic cataclysms—is thus\r\nvery clear.(1805) The fable about the never‐ceasing tears of Niobe, whose\r\ngrief causes Zeus to change her into a fountain—Atlantis covered with\r\nwater—is no less graphic as a symbol. Niobe, let it be remembered, is the\r\ndaughter of one of the Pleiades, or Atlantides, the grand‐daughter of\r\nAtlas therefore,(1806) because she represents the last generations of the\r\ndoomed Continent.\r\n\r\nA true remark, that of Bailly, which says that Atlantis had an enormous\r\ninfluence on antiquity. He adds:\r\n\r\n\r\n    If these mythical names are mere allegories, then all that they\r\n    have of truth comes from Atlantis; if the fable is a real\r\n    tradition—however altered—then the ancient history is wholly their\r\n    history.(1807)\r\n\r\n\r\nSo much so, that all ancient writings—prose and poetry—are full of the\r\nreminiscences of the Lemuro‐Atlanteans, the first _physical_ Races, though\r\nthe Third and the Fourth in number in the evolution of Fourth Round\r\nHumanity on our Globe. Hesiod records the tradition about the men of the\r\nAge of Bronze, whom Jupiter had made out of ash‐wood and who had hearts\r\nharder than diamond. Clad in bronze from head to foot, they passed their\r\nlives in fighting. Monstrous in size, endowed with a terrible strength,\r\ninvincible arms and hands descended from their shoulders, says the\r\npoet.(1808) Such were the giants of the first physical Races.\r\n\r\nThe Iranians have a reference to the later Atlanteans in _Yasna_, ix. 15.\r\nTradition maintains that the “Sons of God,” or the great Initiates of the\r\nSacred Island, took advantage of the Deluge to rid the Earth of all the\r\nSorcerers among the Atlanteans. The said verse addresses Zarathushtra as\r\none of the “Sons of God.” It says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Thou, O Zarathushtra, didst make all demons [Sorcerers], who\r\n    before roamed the world in human forms, conceal themselves in the\r\n    earth [helped them to submersion].\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lemurians, and also the early Atlanteans, were divided into two\r\ndistinct classes—the “Sons of Night” or Darkness, and the “Sons of the\r\nSun” or Light. The old books tell us of terrible battles between the two,\r\nwhen the former, leaving their land of Darkness, whence the Sun departed\r\nfor long months, descended from their inhospitable regions and “tried to\r\nwrench the Lord of Light” from their better‐favoured brothers of the\r\nequatorial regions. We may be told that the Ancients knew nothing of the\r\nlong night of six months’ duration in the polar regions. Even Herodotus,\r\nmore learned than the rest, only mentions a people who slept for six\r\nmonths in the year, and remained awake the other half. Yet the Greeks knew\r\nwell that there was a country in the North where the year was divided into\r\na day and night each of six months’ duration, for Pliny distinctly says\r\nso.(1809) They speak of the Cimmerians and of the Hyperboreans, and draw a\r\ndistinction between the two. The former inhabited the Palus Mæotis—between\r\n45° and 50° latitude. Plutarch explains that they were but a _small\r\nportion_ of a _great nation_ driven away by the Scythians—which nation\r\nstopped near the Tanais, after _having crossed Asia_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    These warlike multitudes lived formerly on the ocean shores, in\r\n    dense forests, and _under a tenebrous sky_. There the pole is\r\n    almost touching the head, there _long nights and days divide the\r\n    year_.(1810)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to the Hyperboreans, these peoples, as expressed by Solinus Polyhistor:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Sow in the morning, reap at noon, gather their fruits in the\r\n    evening, and store them during the night in their caves.(1811)\r\n\r\n\r\nEven the writers of the _Zohar_ knew this fact, as it is written:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the Book of Hammannunah, the Old [or the Ancient], we learn ...\r\n    there are some countries of the earth which are lightened, whilst\r\n    others are in darkness; these have the day, when for the former it\r\n    is night; and there are countries in which it is constantly day,\r\n    or in which at least the night continues only some instants.(1812)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe island of Delos, the Asteria of Greek Mythology, was never in Greece,\r\nfor this country, in that day, was not yet in existence, not even in its\r\nmolecular form. Several writers have shown that it represented a country\r\nor an island, far larger than the small dots of land which became Greece.\r\nBoth Pliny and Diodorus Siculus place it in the Northern Seas. One calls\r\nit Basilea, or “Royal”;(1813) the other, Pliny, names it Osericta,(1814) a\r\nword which, according to Rudbeck,(1815) had\r\n\r\n\r\n    A significance in the northern languages, equivalent to the Island\r\n    of the Divine Kings or God‐kings—\r\n\r\n\r\nor again the “Royal Island of the Gods,” because the Gods were born there,\r\n_i.e._, the Divine Dynasties of the Kings of Atlantis proceeded from that\r\nplace. Let Geographers and Geologists seek for it among that group of\r\nislands discovered by Nordenskiöld on his “Vega” voyage in the Arctic\r\nregions.(1816) The Secret Books inform us that _the climate has changed in\r\nthose regions more than once_, since the first men inhabited those now\r\nalmost inaccessible latitudes. They were a Paradise before they became\r\nHell; the dark Hades of the Greeks, and the cold Realm of Shades where the\r\nScandinavian Hel, the Goddess‐Queen of the country of the dead, “holds\r\nsway deep down in Helheim and Niflheim.” Yet it was the birthplace of\r\nApollo, who was the brightest of Gods, in Heaven—astronomically—as he was\r\nthe most enlightened of the Divine Kings who ruled over the early nations,\r\nin his human meaning. The latter fact is borne out in the _Iliad_, wherein\r\nApollo is said to have appeared four times in his own form (as the God of\r\nthe Four Races) and six times in human form,(1817) _i.e._, as connected\r\nwith the Divine Dynasties of the earlier unseparated Lemurians.\r\n\r\nIt is those early mysterious peoples, their countries—which have now\r\nbecome uninhabitable—as well as the name given to “man” both dead and\r\nalive, which have furnished an opportunity to the ignorant Church Fathers\r\nfor inventing a Hell, which they have transformed into a burning instead\r\nof a freezing locality.(1818)\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, evident that it is neither the Hyperboreans, nor the\r\nCimmerians, the Arimaspes, nor even the Scyths—known to and communicating\r\nwith the Greeks—who were our Atlanteans. But they were all the descendants\r\nof their last sub‐races. The Pelasgians were certainly one of the root‐\r\nraces of future Greece, and were a remnant of a sub‐race of Atlantis.\r\nPlato hints as much in speaking of the latter, whose name, it is averred,\r\ncame from _pelagus_, the “great sea.” Noah’s Deluge is astronomical and\r\nallegorical, but it is not mythical, for the story is based upon the same\r\narchaic tradition of men—or rather of nations—who were saved during the\r\ncataclysms, in canoes, arks, and ships. No one would presume to say that\r\nthe Chaldæan Xisuthrus, the Hindû Vaivasvata, the Chinese Peirun—the\r\n“Beloved of the Gods,” who rescued him from the flood in a canoe—or the\r\nSwedish Belgamer, for whom the Gods did the same in the North, are all\r\nidentical as personages. But their legends have all sprung from the\r\ncatastrophe which involved both the Continent and the Island of Atlantis.\r\n\r\nThe allegory about the antediluvian giants and their achievements in\r\nsorcery is no myth. Biblical events _are_ revealed indeed. But it is\r\nneither by the voice of God amid thunder and lightning on Mount Sinai, nor\r\nby a divine finger tracing the record on tablets of stone, but simply\r\nthrough tradition _viâ_ Pagan sources. It was not surely the _Pentateuch_\r\nthat Diodorus was repeating when he wrote about the Titans—the giants born\r\nof Heaven and Earth, or, rather, born of the Sons of God who took to\r\nthemselves for wives the daughters of men who were fair. Nor was\r\nPherecydes quoting from _Genesis_ when giving details on those giants\r\nwhich are not to be found in the Jewish Scriptures. He says that the\r\nHyperboreans were of the race of the Titans, a race which descended from\r\nthe earliest giants, and that it was that Hyperborean region which was the\r\nbirthplace of the first giants. The Commentaries on the Sacred Books\r\nexplain that the said region was the far North, the Polar Lands now, the\r\nPre‐Lemurian earliest Continent, embracing once upon a time the present\r\nGreenland, Spitzbergen, Sweden, Norway, etc.\r\n\r\nBut who were the Nephilim of _Genesis_ (vi. 4)? There were Palæolithic and\r\nNeolithic men in Palestine ages before the events recorded in the Book of\r\nthe Beginnings. The theological tradition identifies these Nephilim with\r\nhairy men or satyrs, the latter being mythical in the Fifth Race, and the\r\nformer historical in both the Fourth and Fifth Races. We have stated\r\nelsewhere what the prototypes of these satyrs were, and have spoken of the\r\nbestiality of the early and later Atlantean Race. What is the meaning of\r\nPoseidon’s amours under such a variety of _animal_ forms? He became a\r\ndolphin to win Amphitrite; a horse, to seduce Ceres; a ram, to deceive\r\nTheophane, etc. Poseidon is not only the personation of the Spirit and\r\nRace of Atlantis, but also of the vices of these giants. Gesenius and\r\nothers devote an enormous space to the meaning of the word Nephilim and\r\nexplain very little. But Esoteric Records show these hairy creatures to be\r\nthe last descendants of those Lemuro‐Atlantean Races, which begot children\r\non female animals, of species now long extinct; thus producing dumb men,\r\n“monsters,” as the Stanzas have it.\r\n\r\nNow Mythology, built upon Hesiod’s _Theogony_, which is but a poetized\r\nrecord of actual traditions, or oral history, speaks of three giants,\r\ncalled Briareus, Cottus, and Gyges, living in a dark country where they\r\nwere imprisoned by Cronus for their rebellion against him. All the three\r\nare endowed by myth with a hundred arms and fifty heads, the latter\r\nstanding for races, the former for sub‐races and tribes. Bearing in mind\r\nthat in Mythology every personage almost is a God or Demi‐god, and also a\r\nking or simple mortal in his second aspect,(1819) and that both stand as\r\nsymbols for lands, islands, powers of nature, elements, nations, races and\r\nsub‐races, the Esoteric Commentary will become comprehensible. It says\r\nthat the three giants are three polar lands which have changed form\r\nseveral times, at each new cataclysm, or disappearance of one continent to\r\nmake room for another. The whole Globe is convulsed periodically; and has\r\nbeen so convulsed, since the appearance of the First Race, four times.\r\nYet, though the whole face of the Earth was transformed thereby each time,\r\nthe conformation of the Arctic and Antarctic Poles has but little altered.\r\nThe polar lands unite and break off from each other into islands and\r\npeninsulas, yet remain ever the same. Therefore Northern Asia is called\r\nthe “Eternal or Perpetual Land,” and the Antarctic the “Ever‐living” and\r\nthe “Concealed”; while the Mediterranean, Atlantic, Pacific and other\r\nregions disappear and reäppear in turn, into and above the Great Waters.\r\n\r\nFrom the first appearance of the great Continent of Lemuria, the three\r\npolar giants have been imprisoned in their circle by Cronus. Their gaol is\r\nsurrounded by a wall of bronze, and the exit is through gates fabricated\r\nby Poseidon—or Neptune—hence by the seas, which they cannot cross; and it\r\nis in that damp region, where eternal darkness reigns, that the three\r\nbrothers languish. The _Iliad_ makes it Tartarus.(1820) When the Gods and\r\nTitans rebelled in their turn against Zeus—the deity of the Fourth\r\nRace—the Father of the Gods bethought himself of the imprisoned giants\r\nthat they might help him to conquer the Gods and Titans, and to\r\nprecipitate the latter into Hades; or, in clearer words, to have Lemuria\r\nhurled amid thunder and lightning to the bottom of the seas, so as to make\r\nroom for Atlantis, which was to be submerged and perish in its turn.(1821)\r\nThe geological upheaval and deluge of Thessaly was a repetition on a small\r\nscale of the great cataclysm; and, remaining impressed on the memory of\r\nthe Greeks, was merged by them into, and confused with, the general fate\r\nof Atlantis. So, also, the war between the Râkshasas of Lankâ and the\r\nBhârateans, the _mèlée_ of the Atlanteans and Âryans in their supreme\r\nstruggle, or the conflict between the Devs and Izeds, or Peris, became,\r\nages later, the struggle of Titans, separated into two inimical camps, and\r\nstill later the war between the Angels of God and the Angels of Satan.\r\nHistorical facts became theological dogmas. Ambitious scholiasts, men of a\r\nsmall sub‐race born but yesterday, and one of the latest issues of the\r\nÂryan stock, took upon themselves to overturn the religious thought of the\r\nworld, and succeeded. For nearly two thousand years they impressed\r\nthinking humanity with the belief in the existence of Satan.\r\n\r\nBut as it is now the conviction of more than one Greek scholar—as it was\r\nthat of Bailly and Voltaire—that Hesiod’s _Theogony_ is based upon\r\nhistorical facts,(1822) it becomes easier for the Occult Teachings to find\r\ntheir way into the minds of thoughtful men, and therefore are these\r\npassages from Mythology brought forward in our discussion upon modern\r\nlearning in this Addendum.\r\n\r\nSuch symbols as are found in all the exoteric creeds are so many landmarks\r\nof pre‐historic truths. The sunny, happy land, the primitive cradle of the\r\nearliest human races, has become several times since then Hyperborean and\r\nSaturnine;(1823) thus showing the Golden Age and Reign of Saturn from\r\nmultiform aspects. It was many‐sided in its character indeed—climatically,\r\nethnologically and morally. For the Third, Lemurian Race must be\r\nphysiologically divided into the early androgynous and the later bi‐sexual\r\nrace; and the climate of its dwelling‐places and continents into that of\r\nan eternal spring and eternal winter, into life and death, purity and\r\nimpurity. The cycle of legends is ever being transformed on its journey by\r\npopular fancy. Yet it may be cleansed from the dross it has picked up on\r\nits way through many nations, and through the countless minds which have\r\nadded their own exuberant additions to the original facts. Leaving for a\r\nwhile the Greek interpretations, we may seek for some more corroborations\r\nof the latter in the scientific and geological proofs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection VII. Scientific and Geological Proofs of the Existence of Several\r\nSubmerged Continents.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may not be amiss—for the benefit of those who resolve the tradition of\r\na lost Miocene Atlantis into an “antiquated myth”—to append a few\r\nscientific admissions on this point. Science, it is true, is largely\r\nindifferent to such questions. But there are Scientists ready to admit\r\nthat, in any case, a cautious agnosticism as to geological problems\r\nconcerning the remote past is far more philosophical than _à priori_\r\ndenial, or even hasty generalizations on insufficient data.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile two very interesting instances, that have been lately met with,\r\nmay be pointed out as “confirming” certain passages in the letter of a\r\nMaster, published in _Esoteric Buddhism_. The eminence of the authorities\r\nwill not be questioned (we italicize the corresponding passages):\r\n\r\n\r\n    Extract from _Esoteric Buddhism_, p. 70.\r\n\r\n    (1.)\r\n\r\n    The sinking of Atlantis (the group of continents and isles) began\r\n    during the Miocene period ... and it culminated first in the final\r\n    disappearance of the largest continent, _an event coincident with\r\n    the elevation of the Alps_, and second with that of the last of\r\n    the fair islands mentioned by Plato.\r\n\r\n    Extract from a Lecture by W. Pengelly, F.R.S., F.G.S.\r\n\r\n    (1.)\r\n\r\n    Was there, as some have believed, an Atlantis—a continent or\r\n    archipelago of large islands occupying the area of the North\r\n    Atlantic? There is, perhaps, nothing unphilosophical in the\r\n    hypothesis. For since, as geologists state, “_The Alps have\r\n    acquired 4,000 and even in some places more than 10,000 feet of\r\n    their present altitude since the commencement of the Eocene\r\n    epoch_” (Lyell’s _Principles_, p. 256, 2nd Ed.)—_a Post‐Miocene\r\n    depression might have carried the hypothetical Atlantis into\r\n    almost abysmal depths_.(1824)\r\n\r\n    Extract from _Esoteric Buddhism_, pp. 64, 65.\r\n\r\n    (2.)\r\n\r\n    Lemuria ... should no more be confounded with the Atlantis\r\n    Continent than Europe with America. Both sank and were drowned\r\n    with their high civilizations and “gods”; yet between the two\r\n    catastrophes a period of about 700,000 years elapsed, Lemuria\r\n    flourishing and ending her career just about that lapse of time\r\n    before the early part of the _Eocene_ age, since its Race was the\r\n    Third. Behold _the relics of that once great nation in some of the\r\n    flat‐headed aborigines of your Australia_.\r\n\r\n    Extract from an article in the _Popular Science Review_, v. 18, by\r\n    Professor Seemann, Ph.D., F.L.S., V.‐P.A.S.\r\n\r\n    (2.)\r\n\r\n    It would be premature to say, because no evidence has yet been\r\n    adduced, _that men may not have existed in the Eocene age_,\r\n    especially as it can be shown that _a race of men, the lowest we\r\n    know of, co‐exists with that remnant of the Eocene flora which\r\n    still survives on the continent and islands of Australia_.\r\n\r\n    Extract from _The Pedigree of Man_, p. 81.\r\n\r\n    Hæckel, who fully accepts the reality of a former Lemuria, also\r\n    regards the _Australians as direct descendants of the Lemurians_.\r\n    Persistent forms of both [his Lemurian] stems are in all\r\n    probability still surviving, of the former in the Papuans and\r\n    Hottentots, of the latter in the _Australians_ and in one division\r\n    of the Malays.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith regard to a former civilization, of which a _portion_ of these\r\ndegraded Australians are the last surviving offshoot, the opinion of\r\nGerland is strongly suggestive. Commenting upon the religion and mythology\r\nof the tribes, he writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The statement that Australian civilization [?] indicates a higher\r\n    grade, is nowhere more clearly proved than here [in the province\r\n    of religion] where everything resounds like the expiring voices of\r\n    a previous and richer age.... The idea that the Australians have\r\n    no trace of religion or mythology is thoroughly false. But this\r\n    religion is certainly quite deteriorated.(1825)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to Hæckel’s view of the relationship between the Australians and the\r\nMalays, as two branches of a common stock, he is in error when he classes\r\nthe Australians with the rest. The Malays and Papuans are a _mixed_ stock,\r\nresulting from the intermarriages of the low Atlantean sub‐races with the\r\nseventh sub‐race of the Third Root‐Race. Like the Hottentots, they are of\r\nindirect Lemuro‐Atlantean descent. It is a most suggestive fact—to those\r\nconcrete thinkers who demand a _physical_ proof of Karma—that the lowest\r\nraces of men are now rapidly dying out; a phenomenon largely due to an\r\nextraordinary sterility setting in among the women, from the time that\r\nthey were first approached by the Europeans. A process of decimation is\r\ntaking place all over the Globe, among those races, whose “time is\r\nup”—among just those stocks, be it remarked, which Esoteric Philosophy\r\nregards as the senile representatives of lost archaic nations. It is\r\ninaccurate to maintain that the extinction of a lower race is _invariably_\r\ndue to cruelties or abuses perpetrated by colonists. Change of diet,\r\ndrunkenness, etc., have done much; but those who rely on such data as\r\noffering an all‐sufficient explanation of the crux, cannot meet the\r\nphalanx of facts now so closely arrayed. Even the Materialist Lefèvre\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Nothing can save those that have run their course. It would be\r\n    necessary to extend their destined cycle.... _The peoples that\r\n    have been relatively most spared, those who have defended\r\n    themselves most valiantly, Hawaiians or Maories, have been no less\r\n    decimated than the tribes massacred or tainted by European\r\n    intrusion._(1826)\r\n\r\n\r\nTrue; but is not the phenomenon here confirmed, an instance of the\r\noperation of Cyclic Law, difficult to account for on materialist lines?\r\nWhence the “destined cycle” and the order here testified to? Why does this\r\n(Karmic) sterility attack and root out certain races at their “appointed\r\nhour”? The answer that it is due to a “mental disproportion” between the\r\ncolonizing and aboriginal races is obviously evasive, since it does not\r\nexplain the sudden “checks to fertility” which so frequently supervene.\r\nThe dying out of the Hawaiians, for instance, is one of the most\r\nmysterious problems of the day. Ethnology will sooner or later have to\r\nrecognize, with Occultists, that the true solution has to be sought for in\r\na comprehension of the workings of Karma. As Lèfevre remarks:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The time is drawing near when there will remain nothing but three\r\n    great human types.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe time is before the Sixth Root‐Race dawns; the three types are the\r\nwhite (Âryan, Fifth Root‐Race), the yellow, and the African negro—with\r\ntheir crossings (Atlanto‐European divisions). Redskins, Eskimos, Papuans,\r\nAustralians, Polynesians, etc.—all are dying out. Those who realize that\r\nevery Root‐Race runs through a gamut of seven sub‐races with seven\r\nbranchlets, etc., will understand the “why.” The tide‐wave of incarnating\r\nEgos has rolled past them to harvest experience in more developed and less\r\nsenile stocks; and their extinction is hence a Karmic necessity. Some\r\nextraordinary and _unexplained_ statistics as to race extinction are given\r\nby de Quatrefages.(1827) No solution, except on Occult lines, is able to\r\naccount for these.\r\n\r\nBut we have digressed from our direct subject. Let us hear now what\r\nProfessor Huxley has to say on the subject of former Atlantic and Pacific\r\nContinents.\r\n\r\nHe writes in _Nature_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    There is nothing, so far as I am aware, in the biological or\r\n    geological evidence at present accessible, to render untenable the\r\n    hypothesis that _an area of the Mid‐Atlantic or Pacific sea‐bed as\r\n    big as Europe_, should have been upheaved as high as Mont Blanc,\r\n    and have subsided again any time since the Palæozoic epoch, if\r\n    there were any grounds for entertaining it.(1828)\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is to say, then, that there is nothing to militate against _positive_\r\nevidence of the fact; nothing, therefore, against the geological\r\npostulates of the Esoteric Philosophy. Dr. Berthold Seemann assures us in\r\nthe _Popular Science Review_ that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The facts which botanists have accumulated for reconstructing\r\n    these lost maps of the globe are rather comprehensive; and they\r\n    have not been backward in demonstrating the former existence of\r\n    several large tracts of solid land in parts now occupied by great\r\n    oceans. The many striking points of contact between the present\r\n    floras of the United States and Eastern Asia, induced them to\r\n    assume that, during the present order of things, there existed a\r\n    continental connection between South‐Eastern Asia and Western\r\n    America. The singular correspondence of the present flora of the\r\n    Southern United States with that of the lignite flora of Europe\r\n    induces them to believe that, in the Miocene period, Europe and\r\n    America were connected by a land passage, of which Iceland,\r\n    Madeira, and the other Atlantic islands are remnants; that, in\r\n    fact, the story of an Atlantis, which an Egyptian priest told to\r\n    Solon, is not purely fictitious, but rests upon a solid historical\r\n    basis.... Europe of the Eocene period received the plants which\r\n    spread over mountains and plains, valleys and river‐banks (from\r\n    Asia generally), neither exclusively from the South nor from the\r\n    East. The West also furnished additions, and if at that period\r\n    these were rather meagre, they show, at all events, that the\r\n    bridge was already building, which, at a later period, was to\r\n    facilitate communication between the two continents in such a\r\n    remarkable manner. At that time some plants of the Western\r\n    Continent began to reach Europe by means of the island of\r\n    Atlantis, then probably just [?] just rising above the\r\n    ocean.(1829)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd in another number of the same review(1830) Mr. W. Duppa Crotch, M.A.,\r\nF.L.S., in an article entitled “The Norwegian Lemming and its Migrations,”\r\nalludes to the same subject:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Is it probable that land could have existed where now the broad\r\n    Atlantic rolls? All tradition says so: old Egyptian records speak\r\n    of Atlantis, as Strabo and others have told us. The Sahara itself\r\n    is the sand of an ancient sea, and the shells which are found upon\r\n    its surface prove that, no longer ago than the Miocene period, a\r\n    sea rolled over what is now desert. The voyage of the “Challenger”\r\n    has proved the existence of three long ridges(1831) in the\r\n    Atlantic Ocean,(1832) one extending for more than three thousand\r\n    miles, and lateral spurs may, by connecting these ridges, account\r\n    for the marvellous similarity of the fauna of the Atlantic\r\n    islands.(1833)...\r\n\r\n    The submerged continent of _Lemuria_, in what is now the Indian\r\n    Ocean, is considered to afford an explanation of many difficulties\r\n    in the distribution of organic life, and, I think, the existence\r\n    of a _Miocene Atlantis_ will be found to have a strong elucidative\r\n    bearing on subjects of greater interest [truly so!] than the\r\n    migration of the lemming. At all events, if it can be shown that\r\n    land existed in former ages where the North Atlantic now rolls,\r\n    not only is a motive found for these apparently suicidal\r\n    migrations, but also a strong collateral proof that what we call\r\n    instincts are but the blind and sometimes even prejudicial\r\n    inheritance of previously acquired experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt certain periods, we learn, multitudes of these animals swim to sea and\r\nperish. Coming, as they do, from all parts of Norway, the powerful\r\ninstinct which survives throughout ages as an inheritance from their\r\nprogenitors impels them to seek a continent, once existing but now\r\nsubmerged beneath the ocean, and to court a watery grave.\r\n\r\nIn an article containing a criticism of Mr. A. R. Wallace’s _Island\r\nLife_—a work devoted largely to the question of the distribution of\r\nanimals, etc.—Mr. Starkie Gardiner writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n    By a process of reasoning supported by a large array of facts of\r\n    different kinds, he arrives at the conclusion that the\r\n    distribution of life upon the land as we now see it has been\r\n    accomplished without the aid of important changes in the relative\r\n    positions of continents and seas. Yet if we accept his views, we\r\n    must believe that Asia and Africa, Madagascar and Africa, New\r\n    Zealand and Australia, Europe and America, have been united at\r\n    some period not remote geologically, and that seas to the depth of\r\n    1,000 fathoms have been bridged over; but we must treat as\r\n    “utterly gratuitous and entirely opposed to all the evidences at\r\n    our command” [! !], the supposition that temperate Europe and\r\n    temperate America, Australia, and South America, have ever been\r\n    connected, except by way of the Arctic or Antarctic Circles, and\r\n    that lands now separated by seas of more than 1,000 fathoms depth\r\n    have ever been united.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Wallace, it must be admitted, has succeeded in explaining the\r\n    chief features of existing life distribution, without bridging the\r\n    Atlantic or Pacific, except towards the Poles, yet I cannot help\r\n    thinking that some of the facts might perhaps be more easily\r\n    explained by admitting the former existence of the connection\r\n    between the coast of Chili and Polynesia(1834) and Great Britain\r\n    and Florida, shadowed by the sub‐marine banks which stretch\r\n    between them. Nothing is urged that renders these more direct\r\n    connections impossible, and no physical reason is advanced why the\r\n    floor of the ocean should not be upheaved from any depth. The\r\n    route by which [according to the Anti‐Atlantean and Lemurian\r\n    hypotheses of Wallace] the floras of South America and Australia\r\n    are supposed to have mingled, is beset by almost insurmountable\r\n    obstacles, and the apparently sudden arrival of a number of\r\n    subtropical American plants in our Eocenes necessitates a\r\n    connection more to the South than the present 1,000 fathom line.\r\n    Forces are unceasingly acting, and there is _no reason why an\r\n    elevating force once set in action in the centre of an ocean\r\n    should cease to act until a continent is formed_. They have acted\r\n    and lifted out from the sea, in comparatively recent geological\r\n    time, the loftiest mountains on earth. Mr. Wallace himself admits\r\n    repeatedly that sea‐beds have been elevated 1,000 fathoms, and\r\n    islands have risen up from the depths of 3,000 fathoms; and to\r\n    suppose that the upheaving forces are limited in power, is, it\r\n    seems to me, to again quote from _Island Life_, “utterly\r\n    gratuitous and entirely opposed to all the evidences at our\r\n    command.”(1835)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “father” of English Geology—Sir Charles Lyell—was a uniformitarian in\r\nhis views of continental formation. We find him saying:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Professors Unger (_Die Versunkene Insel Atlantis_) and Heer\r\n    (_Flora Tertiaria Helvetiæ_) have advocated on botanical grounds\r\n    _the former existence of an Atlantic Continent during some part of\r\n    the tertiary period_, as affording the only plausible explanation\r\n    that can be imagined of the analogy between the Miocene flora of\r\n    Central Europe, and the existing flora of Eastern America.\r\n    Professor Oliver, on the other hand, after showing how many of the\r\n    American types found fossil in Europe are common to Japan,\r\n    inclines to the theory, first advanced by Dr. Asa Gray, that the\r\n    migration of species, to which the community of types in the\r\n    Eastern States of North America, and the Miocene flora of Europe\r\n    is due, took place when there was an overland communication from\r\n    America to Eastern Asia between the fiftieth and sixtieth\r\n    parallels of latitude, or south of Behring’s Straits, following\r\n    the direction of the Aleutian islands. By this course they may\r\n    have made their way, at any epoch, Miocene, Pliocene, or\r\n    Postpliocene, antecedently to the Glacial epoch, to Amoorland, on\r\n    the East coast of Northern Asia.(1836)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe unnecessary difficulties and complications here incurred in order to\r\navoid the hypothesis of an Atlantic Continent, are really too apparent to\r\nescape notice. _If the botanical evidences stood alone_, scepticism would\r\nbe partially reasonable; but in this case all branches of Science converge\r\nto one point. Science has made blunders, and has exposed itself to greater\r\nerrors than it would be exposed to by the admission of our two now\r\ninvisible Continents. It has denied even the undeniable, from the days of\r\nthe Mathematician Laplace down to our own, and that only a few years\r\nago.(1837) We have Professor Huxley’s authority for saying that there is\r\nno _à priori_ improbability whatever against possible evidences supporting\r\nthe belief. But now that the _positive evidence is brought forward_, will\r\nthat eminent Scientist admit the corollary?\r\n\r\nTouching on the problem in another place Sir Charles Lyell tells us:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Respecting the cosmogony of the Egyptian priests, we gather much\r\n    information from writers of the Grecian sects, who borrowed almost\r\n    all their tenets from Egypt, and amongst others that of the former\r\n    successive destruction and renovation of the world [_continental_,\r\n    not cosmic, catastrophes]. We learn from Plutarch that this was\r\n    the theme of one of the hymns of Orpheus, so celebrated in the\r\n    fabulous ages of Greece. It was brought by him from the banks of\r\n    the Nile; and we even find in his verses, as in the Indian\r\n    systems, a definite period assigned for the duration of every\r\n    successive world. The returns of great catastrophes were\r\n    determined by the period of the Annus Magnus, or great year, a\r\n    cycle composed of the revolutions of the sun, moon, and planets,\r\n    and terminating when these return together to the same sign whence\r\n    they were supposed at some remote epoch to have set out.... We\r\n    learn particularly from the _Timæus_ of Plato that the Egyptians\r\n    believed the world to be subject to occasional conflagrations and\r\n    deluges. The sect of Stoics adopted most fully the system of\r\n    catastrophes destined at certain intervals to destroy the world.\r\n    These, they taught, were of two kinds—the cataclysm, or\r\n    _destruction by deluge_, which sweeps away the whole human race,\r\n    and annihilates all the animal and vegetable productions of\r\n    nature, and the _ecpyrosis_, or _conflagration_, which destroys\r\n    the globe itself [submarine volcanoes]. From the Egyptians they\r\n    derived the doctrine of the gradual debasement of man from a state\r\n    of innocence [nascent simplicity of the first sub‐races of each\r\n    Root‐Race]. Towards the termination of each era the gods could no\r\n    longer bear with the wickedness of men [degeneracy into magical\r\n    practices and gross animality of the Atlanteans], and a shock of\r\n    the elements, or a deluge, overwhelmed them; after which calamity,\r\n    Astræa again descended on the earth to renew the golden age [dawn\r\n    of a new Root‐Race].(1838)\r\n\r\n\r\nAstræa, the Goddess of Justice, is the last of the deities to forsake the\r\nEarth, when the Gods are said to abandon it and to be taken up again into\r\nheaven by Jupiter. But, no sooner does Zeus carry from Earth Ganymedes—the\r\nobject of _lust_, personified—than the Father of the Gods throws down\r\nAstræa on the Earth again, on which she falls _upon her head_. Astræa is\r\nVirgo, the constellation of the Zodiac. Astronomically it has a very plain\r\nsignificance, and one which gives the key to the occult meaning. But it is\r\ninseparable from Leo, the sign that precedes it, and from the Pleiades and\r\ntheir sisters, the Hyades, of which Aldebaran is the brilliant leader. All\r\nthese are connected with the periodical renovations of the Earth, with\r\nregard to its continents—even Ganymedes, who in astronomy is Aquarius. It\r\nhas already been shown that while the South Pole is the “Pit” (or the\r\ninfernal regions figuratively and cosmologically), the North Pole is\r\ngeographically the First Continent; while astronomically and\r\nmetaphorically the Celestial Pole, with its Pole Star in Heaven, is Meru,\r\nor the Seat of Brahmâ, the Throne of Jupiter, etc. For in the age when the\r\nGods forsook the Earth and were said to ascend into Heaven, the ecliptic\r\nhad become parallel with the meridian, and part of the Zodiac appeared to\r\ndescend from the North Pole to the north horizon. Aldebaran was in\r\nconjunction then with the Sun, as it was 40,000 years ago, at the great\r\nfestival in commemoration of that Annus Magnus, of which Plutarch spoke.\r\nSince that Year—40,000 years ago—there has been a retrograde motion of the\r\nequator, and about 31,000 years ago Aldebaran was in conjunction with the\r\nvernal equinoctial point. The part assigned to Taurus, even in Christian\r\nMysticism, is too well known to need repetition. The famous Orphic Hymn on\r\nthe great periodical cataclysm divulges the whole Esotericism of the\r\nevent. Pluto, in the Pit, carries off Eurydice, bitten by the Polar\r\nSerpent. Then Leo, the Lion, is vanquished. Now, when the Lion is “in the\r\nPit,” or below the South Pole, then Virgo, as the next sign, follows him,\r\nand when her head, down to the waist, is below the southern horizon—she is\r\ninverted. On the other hand, the Hyades are the rain or Deluge\r\nconstellations; and Aldebaran—he who follows, or _succeeds_ the daughters\r\nof Atlas, or the Pleiades—looks down from the eye of Taurus. It is from\r\nthis point of the ecliptic that the calculations of the new cycle were\r\ncommenced. The student has to remember also, that when\r\nGanymedes—Aquarius—is raised to heaven—or above the horizon of the North\r\nPole—Virgo or Astræa, who is Venus‐Lucifer, descends head downwards below\r\nthe horizon of the South Pole, or the Pit; which Pit, or the Pole, is also\r\nthe Great Dragon, or the Flood. Let the student exercise his intuition by\r\nplacing these facts together; no more can be said. Lyell remarks:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The connection between the doctrine of successive catastrophes and\r\n    repeated deteriorations in the moral character of the human race,\r\n    is more intimate and natural than might at first be imagined. For,\r\n    in a rude state of society, all great calamities are regarded by\r\n    the people as judgments of God on the wickedness of man.... In\r\n    like manner in the account given to Solon by the Egyptian priests\r\n    of the submersion of the island of Atlantis under the waters of\r\n    the ocean, after repeated shocks of an earthquake, we find that\r\n    _the event happened when Jupiter had seen the moral depravity of\r\n    the inhabitants_.(1839)\r\n\r\n\r\nTrue; but was it not owing to the fact that all Esoteric truths were given\r\nout to the public by the Initiates of the temples _under the guise of\r\nallegories_? “Jupiter,” is merely the personification of that immutable\r\nCyclic Law, which arrests the downward tendency of each Root‐Race after\r\nattaining the zenith of its glory.(1840) We must admit allegorical\r\nteaching, unless we hold with Prof. John Fiske’s singularly dogmatic\r\nopinion that a myth:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Is an explanation by the uncivilized mind, of some natural\r\n    phenomenon; not an allegory, not an esoteric symbol, for the\r\n    ingenuity is wasted [!!] which strives to detect in myths the\r\n    remnants of a refined primeval science—but an explanation.\r\n    Primitive men had no profound science to perpetuate by means of\r\n    allegory [how does Mr. Fiske know?], nor were they such sorry\r\n    pedants as to talk in riddles when plain language would serve\r\n    their purpose.(1841)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe venture to say the language of the initiated few was far more “plain,”\r\nand their Science‐Philosophy far more comprehensive and satisfying alike\r\nto the physical and _spiritual_ wants of man, than even the terminology\r\nand system elaborated by Mr. Fiske’s master—Herbert Spencer. What,\r\nhowever, is Sir Charles Lyell’s “explanation” of the “myth”? Certainly, he\r\nin no way countenances the idea of its “astronomical” origin, as asserted\r\nby some writers.\r\n\r\nThe two interpreters are entirely at variance with one another. Lyell’s\r\nsolution is as follows. A disbeliever in cataclysmal changes from the\r\nabsence (?) of any reliable historical data on the point, as well as from\r\na strong bias to the uniformitarian conceptions of geologic changes,(1842)\r\nhe attempts to trace the Atlantis “tradition” to the following sources:\r\n\r\n(1) Barbarous tribes connect catastrophes with an avenging God, who is\r\nassumed in this way to punish immoral races.\r\n\r\n(2) Hence the commencement of a new race is logically a virtuous one.\r\n\r\n(3) The primary source of the geologic basis of the tradition was Asia—a\r\ncontinent subject to violent earthquakes. Exaggerated accounts would thus\r\nbe handed down the ages.\r\n\r\n(4) Egypt, being herself free from earthquakes, nevertheless based her not\r\ninconsiderable geologic knowledge on these cataclysmal traditions.\r\n\r\nAn ingenious “explanation,” as all such are! But proving a negative is\r\nproverbially a difficult task. Students of Esoteric Science, who know what\r\nthe resources of the Egyptian priesthood really were, need no such\r\nlaboured hypothesis. Moreover, while an imaginative theorist is always\r\nable to furnish a reasonable solution of problems which, in one branch of\r\nScience, seem to necessitate the hypothesis of periodical cataclysmic\r\nchanges on the surface of our planet, the impartial critic who is not a\r\nspecialist, will recognize the immense difficulty of explaining away the\r\ncumulative evidences—namely, the archaeological, ethnological, geological,\r\ntraditional, botanical, and even biological—in favour of former continents\r\nnow submerged. When each science is fighting for its own hand, the\r\ncumulative force of the evidence is almost invariably lost sight of.\r\n\r\nIn the _Theosophist_ we wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We have as evidence the most ancient traditions of various and\r\n    wide‐separated peoples—legends in India, in ancient Greece,\r\n    Madagascar, Sumatra, Java, and all the principal isles of\r\n    Polynesia, as well as the legends of both Americas. Among savages,\r\n    and in the traditions of the richest literature in the world—the\r\n    Sanskrit literature of India—there is an agreement in saying,\r\n    that, ages ago, there existed in the Pacific Ocean, a large\r\n    Continent, which by a geological upheaval was engulfed by the\r\n    sea(1843) [Lemuria]. And it is our firm belief ... that most, if\r\n    not all, of the islands from the Malayan Archipelago to Polynesia,\r\n    are fragments of that once immense submerged Continent. Both\r\n    Malacca and Polynesia, which lie at the two extremities of the\r\n    ocean, and which, since the memory of man, never had nor could\r\n    have any intercourse with, or even a knowledge of each other, have\r\n    yet a tradition common to all the islands and islets, that their\r\n    respective countries extended far, far into the Sea; that there\r\n    were in the world but two immense continents, one inhabited by\r\n    yellow, the other by dark men; and that the Ocean, by command of\r\n    the Gods, and to punish them for their incessant quarrelling,\r\n    swallowed them up. Notwithstanding the geographical fact that New\r\n    Zealand, and Sandwich and Easter Islands, are at a distance from\r\n    each other of between 800 and 1,000 leagues, and that, according\r\n    to every testimony, neither these nor any other intermediate\r\n    islands, for instance, the Marquesan, Society, Fiji, Tahitian,\r\n    Samoan, and other islands, could, since they became islands,\r\n    ignorant as their people were of the compass, have communicated\r\n    with each other before the arrival of Europeans; yet they one and\r\n    all maintain that their respective countries extended far toward\r\n    the West, on the Asian side. Moreover with very small differences,\r\n    they all speak dialects evidently of the same language, and\r\n    understand each other with little difficulty, have the same\r\n    religious beliefs and superstitions, and pretty much the same\r\n    customs. And as few of the Polynesian islands were discovered\r\n    earlier than a century ago, and the Pacific Ocean itself was\r\n    unknown to Europe until the days of Columbus, and these islanders\r\n    have never ceased repeating the same old traditions since the\r\n    Europeans first set foot on their shores, it seems to us a logical\r\n    inference that our theory is nearer to the truth than any other.\r\n    Chance would have to change its name and meaning, were all this\r\n    due but to chance alone.(1844)\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Schmidt, writing in defence of the hypothesis of a former\r\nLemuria, declares:\r\n\r\n\r\n    A great series of animal‐geographical facts is explicable only on\r\n    the hypothesis of the former existence of a Southern Continent of\r\n    which the Australian mainland is a remnant.... [The distribution\r\n    of species] points to the vanished land of the south, where\r\n    perhaps the home of the progenitors of the Maki of Madagascar may\r\n    also be looked for.(1845)\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. A. R. Wallace, in his _Malay Archipelago_, arrives at the following\r\nconclusion after a review of the mass of evidence at hand:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The inference that we must draw from these facts is undoubtedly\r\n    that the whole of the islands eastwards beyond Java and Borneo do\r\n    essentially form a part of a former Australian or Pacific\r\n    Continent, although some of them may never have been actually\r\n    joined to it. This continent must have been broken up not only\r\n    before the Western Islands were separated from Asia, but probably\r\n    before the extreme south‐eastern portion of Asia was raised above\r\n    the waters of the ocean, for a great part of the land of Borneo\r\n    and Java is known to be geologically of quite recent\r\n    formation.(1846)\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Hæckel:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Probably Southern Asia itself was not the earliest cradle of the\r\n    human race; but Lemuria, a continent that lay to the South of\r\n    Asia, and sank later on beneath the surface of the Indian\r\n    Ocean.(1847)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn one sense Hæckel is right as to Lemuria—the “cradle of the human race.”\r\nThat Continent _was_ the home of the first _physical_ human stock—the\r\nlater Third‐Race Men. Previous to that epoch the Races were far less\r\nconsolidated and physiologically quite different. Hæckel makes Lemuria\r\nextend from Sunda Island to Africa and Madagascar and eastwards to Upper\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nProfessor Rütimeyer, the eminent Palæontologist, asks:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Need the conjecture that the almost exclusively graminivorous and\r\n    insectivorous marsupials, sloths, armadilloes, ant‐eaters and\r\n    ostriches, once possessed an actual point of union in a Southern\r\n    Continent of which the present flora of Terra del Fuego and\r\n    Australia must be the remains—need this conjecture raise\r\n    difficulties at a moment when, from their fossil remains, Heer\r\n    restores to our sight the ancient forests of Smith’s Sound and\r\n    Spitzbergen?(1848)\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving now dealt generally with the broad scientific attitude on the two\r\nquestions, it will, perhaps, conduce to an agreeable brevity, if we sum up\r\nthe more striking isolated facts in favour of that fundamental contention\r\nof Esoteric Ethnologists—the reality of Atlantis. Lemuria is so widely\r\naccepted, that further pursuit of the subject is unnecessary. With regard,\r\nhowever, to the former, it is found that:\r\n\r\n(1) The Miocene floræ of Europe have their most numerous and striking\r\nanalogues in the floræ of the United States. In the forests of Virginia\r\nand Florida are found the magnolias, tulip‐trees, evergreen oaks, plane\r\ntrees, etc., which correspond with European Tertiary flora, term for term.\r\nHow was the migration effected, if we exclude the theory of an Atlantic\r\nContinent bridging the ocean between America and Europe? The proposed\r\n“explanation” to the effect that the transition was by way of Asia and the\r\nAleutian Islands is a mere uncalled‐for theory, obviously upset by the\r\nfact that a large number of these floræ only appear _East_ of the Rocky\r\nMountains. This also negatives the idea of a Trans‐Pacific migration. They\r\nare now superseded by European continents and islands to the North.\r\n\r\n(2) Skulls exhumed on the banks of the Danube and Rhine bear a _striking\r\nsimilarity_ to those of the Caribs and Old Peruvians (Littré). Monuments\r\nhave been exhumed in Central America, which bear representations of\r\nundoubted _negro_ heads and faces. How are such facts to be accounted for\r\nexcept on the Atlantean hypothesis? What is now N.W. Africa was once\r\nconnected with Atlantis by a network of islands, few of which now remain.\r\n\r\n(3) According to Farrar the “_isolated_ language” of the Basques has no\r\naffinities with the other languages of Europe,(1849) but with:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The aboriginal languages of the vast opposite continent [America]\r\n    and those alone.(1850)\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Broca is also of the same opinion.\r\n\r\nPalæolithic European man of the Miocene and Pliocene times was a pure\r\nAtlantean, as we have previously stated. The Basques are, of course, of a\r\nmuch later date than this, but their affinities, as here shown, go far to\r\nprove the original extraction of their remote ancestors. The “mysterious”\r\naffinity between their tongue and that of the Dravidian races of India\r\nwill be understood by those who have followed our outline of continental\r\nformations and shiftings.\r\n\r\n(4) Stones have been found in the Canary Islands bearing sculptured\r\nsymbols similar to those found on the shore of Lake Superior. Berthollet\r\nwas induced by such evidence to postulate the unity of race of the early\r\nmen of the Canary Islands and America.(1851)\r\n\r\nThe Guanches of the Canary Islands were lineal descendants of the\r\nAtlanteans. This fact will account for the _great stature_ evidenced by\r\ntheir old skeletons, as well as by those of their European congeners, the\r\nCro‐Magnon Palæolithic men.\r\n\r\n(5) Any experienced mariner has but to navigate the fathomless ocean along\r\nthe Canary Islands to ask himself the question when or how that group of\r\nvolcanic and rocky little islands has been formed, surrounded on every\r\nside by that vast watery space. Frequent questions of this kind led\r\nfinally to the expedition of the famous Leopold von Buch, which took place\r\nin the first quarter of the present century. Some Geologists maintained\r\nthat the volcanic islands had been raised right from the bottom of the\r\nocean, the depth of which in the immediate vicinity of the island varies\r\nfrom 6,000 to 18,000 feet. Others were inclined to see in these\r\ngroups—including Madeira, the Azores, and the islands of Cape de Verde—the\r\nremnants of a gigantic but submerged continent which had once united\r\nAfrica with America. The latter men of Science supported their hypothesis\r\nby a mass of evidence in its favour, drawn from ancient “myths.” Hoary\r\n“superstitions,” such as the fairy‐like Atlantis of Plato, the Garden of\r\nthe Hesperides, Atlas supporting the world on his shoulders, all of them\r\nmythoi connected with the Peak of Teneriffe, did not go far with sceptical\r\nScience. The identity of animal and vegetable species, showing either a\r\nprevious connection between America and the remaining groups of the\r\nislands—the hypothesis of their having been drifted from the New to the\r\nOld World by the waves was too absurd to stand long—found more serious\r\nconsideration. But it is only quite lately, and after Donnelly’s book had\r\nbeen published several years, that the theory has had a greater chance\r\nthan ever of becoming an accepted fact. Fossils found on the _Eastern\r\nCoast_ of South America have now been _proved_ to belong to the Jurassic\r\nformations, and are nearly identical with the Jurassic fossils of\r\n_Western_ Europe and _Northern_ Africa. The geological structure of both\r\ncoasts is also almost identical; the resemblance between the smaller\r\nmarine animals dwelling in the more shallow waters of the South American,\r\nthe Western African, and the South European coasts, is also very great.\r\nAll such facts are bound to bring Naturalists to the conclusion that there\r\nhas been, in distant pre‐historic ages, a continent which extended from\r\nthe coast of Venezuela, across the Atlantic Ocean, to the Canarese Islands\r\nand North Africa, and from Newfoundland nearly to the coast of France.\r\n\r\n(6) The great resemblance between the Jurassic fossils of South America,\r\nNorth Africa, and Western Europe is a striking enough fact in itself, and\r\nadmits of no explanation, unless the ocean is bridged with an Atlantis.\r\nBut why, also, is there so marked a similarity between the fauna of the\r\n(now) isolated Atlantic islands? Why did the specimens of Brazilian fauna\r\ndredged up by Sir C. Wyville Thompson resemble those of Western Europe?\r\nWhy does a resemblance exist between many of the West African and West\r\nIndian animal groups? Again:\r\n\r\n\r\n    When the animals and plants of the Old and New World are compared,\r\n    one cannot but be struck with their identity; all, or nearly all,\r\n    belong to the same genera, while many, even of the species, are\r\n    common to both continents ... indicating that they radiated from a\r\n    common centre [Atlantis].(1852)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe horse, according to Science, originated in America. At least, a large\r\nproportion of the once “missing links” connecting it with inferior forms\r\nhave been exhumed from American strata. How did the horse penetrate into\r\nEurope and Asia, if no land communication bridged the oceanic interspaces?\r\nOr if it is asserted that the horse originated in the Old World, how did\r\nsuch forms as the hipparion, etc., get into America in the first instance\r\non the migration hypothesis?\r\n\r\nAgain:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Buffon had ... remarked the repetition of the African in the\r\n    American fauna, how, for example, the llama is a juvenescent and\r\n    feeble copy of the camel, and how the puma of the New represents\r\n    the lion of the Old World.(1853)\r\n\r\n\r\n(7) The following quotation runs with No. 2, but its significance is such\r\nand the writer cited is so authoritative, that it deserves a place to\r\nitself:\r\n\r\n\r\n    With regard to the primitive dolichocephalæ of America, I\r\n    entertain a hypothesis still more bold, namely, that they are\r\n    nearly related to the Guanches of the Canary Islands, and to the\r\n    Atlantic populations of Africa, the Moors, Tuaricks, Copts, which\r\n    Latham comprises under the name of Egyptian‐Atlantidæ. We find one\r\n    and the same form of skull in the Canary Islands, in front of the\r\n    African coast, and in the Carib islands, on the opposite coast\r\n    which faces Africa. The colour of the skin on both sides of the\r\n    Atlantic is represented in these populations as being of a\r\n    reddish‐brown.(1854)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf, then, Basques and Cro‐Magnon Cave‐Men are of the same race as the\r\nCanarese Guanches, it follows that the former are also allied to the\r\naborigines of America. This is the conclusion necessitated by the\r\nindependent investigations of Retzius, Virchow, and de Quatrefages. The\r\nAtlantean affinities of these three types become patent.\r\n\r\n(8) The sea‐soundings undertaken by H.M.S. “Challenger” and the “Dolphin,”\r\nhave established the fact that a huge elevation some 3,000 miles in\r\nlength, projecting upwards from the abysmal depths of the Atlantic,\r\nextends from a point near the British Islands southwards, curving round\r\nnear Cape de Verde, and running in a south‐easterly direction along the\r\nWest African coast. This elevation averages some 9,000 feet in height, and\r\nrises above the waves at the Azores, Ascension, and other places. In the\r\nocean depths around the neighbourhood of the former the ribs of a once\r\nmassive piece of land have been discovered.(1855)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The inequalities, the mountains and valleys of its surface could\r\n    never have been produced in accordance with any known laws for the\r\n    deposition of sediment, nor by submarine elevation; but, on the\r\n    contrary, must have been carved by agencies acting above the\r\n    water‐level.(1856)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is most probable that necks of land formerly existed knitting Atlantis\r\nto South America, somewhere above the mouth of the Amazon, to Africa near\r\nCape de Verde, while a similar point of juncture with Spain is not\r\nunlikely, as contended for by Donnelly.(1857) Whether the latter existed\r\nor not, is of no consequence, in view of the fact that what is now N.W.\r\nAfrica was—before the elevation of the Sahara and the rupture of the\r\nGibraltar connection—an extension of Spain. Consequently no difficulty can\r\nbe raised as to how the migration of the European fauna, etc., took place.\r\n\r\nEnough has now been said from the purely scientific standpoint, and it is\r\nneedless, in view of the manner in which the subject has already been\r\ndeveloped on the lines of Esoteric Knowledge, to swell the mass of\r\ntestimony further. In conclusion, the words of one of the most intuitive\r\nwriters of the day may be cited as admirably illustrative of the opinions\r\nof the Occultist, who awaits in patience the dawn of the coming day:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We are but beginning to understand the past; one hundred years ago\r\n    the world knew nothing of Pompeii or Herculaneum; nothing of the\r\n    lingual tie that binds together the Indo‐European nations; nothing\r\n    of the significance of the vast volume of inscriptions upon the\r\n    tombs and temples of Egypt; nothing of the meaning of the arrow‐\r\n    headed inscriptions of Babylon; nothing of the marvellous\r\n    civilizations revealed in the remains of Yucatan, Mexico, and\r\n    Peru. We are on the threshold. Scientific investigation is\r\n    advancing with giant strides. Who shall say that one hundred years\r\n    from now, the great museums of the world may not be adorned with\r\n    gems, statues, arms, and implements from Atlantis, while the\r\n    libraries of the world shall contain translations of its\r\n    inscriptions, throwing new light upon all the past history of the\r\n    human race, and all the great problems which now perplex the\r\n    thinkers of to‐day.(1858)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now to conclude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have concerned ourself with the ancient records of the nations, with\r\nthe doctrine of chronological and psychic cycles, of which these records\r\nare the tangible proof; and with many other subjects, which may, at first\r\nsight, seem out of place in this Volume. But they are necessary in truth.\r\nIn dealing with the secret annals and traditions of so many nations, whose\r\nvery origins have never been ascertained on more secure grounds than\r\ninferential suppositions, in giving out the beliefs and philosophy of more\r\nthan pre‐historic races, it is not quite as easy to deal with the subject\r\nmatter as it would be if only the philosophy and evolution of one special\r\nrace, were concerned. The Secret Doctrine was the common property of the\r\ncountless millions of men born under various climates, in times with which\r\nhistory refuses to deal, and to which Esoteric Teachings assign dates\r\nincompatible with the theories of Geology and Anthropology. The birth and\r\nevolution of the Sacred Science of the Past are lost in the very night of\r\nTime, and that even which is historic—_i.e._, that which is found\r\nscattered hither and thither throughout ancient classical literature—is,\r\nin almost every case, attributed by modern criticism to lack of\r\nobservation in the ancient writers, or to superstition born out of the\r\nignorance of antiquity. It is, therefore, impossible to treat this subject\r\nas one would the ordinary evolution of an art or science in some well‐\r\nknown historical nation. It is only by bringing before the reader an\r\nabundance of proofs all tending to show that in every age, under every\r\ncondition of civilization and knowledge, the educated classes of every\r\nnation made themselves the more or less faithful echoes of one identical\r\nsystem and its fundamental traditions—that he can be made to see that so\r\nmany streams of the same water must have had a common source from which\r\nthey started. What was this source? If coming events are said to cast\r\ntheir shadows before, past events cannot fail to leave their impress\r\nbehind them. It is, then, by those shadows of the hoary Past and their\r\nfantastic silhouettes on the external screen of every Religion and\r\nPhilosophy, that we can, by checking them as we go along and comparing\r\nthem, trace out finally the body that produced them. There must be truth\r\nand fact in that which every people of antiquity accepted and made the\r\nfoundation of its religions and its faith. Moreover, as Haliburton said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Hear one side, and you will be in the dark; hear both sides, and\r\n    all will be clear.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe public has hitherto had access to, and has heard but one side, or\r\nrather the one‐sided views of two diametrically opposed classes of men,\r\nwhose _primâ facie_ propositions or respective premises differ widely, but\r\nwhose final conclusions are the same—the men of Science and Theology. And\r\nnow our readers have an opportunity of hearing the other, and so of\r\nlearning the defendants’ justification and the nature of our arguments.\r\n\r\nIf the public is to be left to its old opinions—namely, on one side, that\r\nOccultism, Magic, the legends of old etc., are all the outcome of\r\nignorance and superstition; and on the other, that everything outside the\r\northodox groove is the work of the devil—what will be the result? In other\r\nwords, had no theosophical and mystic literature obtained a hearing for\r\nthe last few years, the present work would have had but a poor chance of\r\nimpartial consideration. It would have been proclaimed—and by many will\r\nstill be proclaimed—a fairy tale woven out of abstruse problems, poised\r\nin, and based on the air; built of soap‐bubbles, bursting at the slightest\r\ntouch of serious reflection, with no foundation to stand upon. Even the\r\nancient “superstitious and credulous” classical writers have no word of\r\nreference to it in clear and unmistakable terms, and the symbols\r\nthemselves fail to yield a hint of the existence of such a system. Such\r\nwould be the verdict of all. But when it becomes undeniably proven that\r\nthe claim of the modern Asiatic nations to a Secret Science and an\r\nEsoteric History of the world is based on fact; that though hitherto\r\nunknown to the masses and a veiled mystery even to the learned—because\r\nthey have never had the key to a right understanding of the abundant hints\r\nthrown out by the ancient classics—it is still no fairy tale, but an\r\nactuality; then the present work will become but the pioneer of many more\r\nsuch books. The statement that hitherto even the keys discovered by some\r\ngreat scholars have proved too rusty for use, and that they are but the\r\nsilent witnesses that there do exist mysteries behind the veil which are\r\nunreachable without a new key, is borne out by too many proofs to be\r\neasily dismissed. An instance may be given as an illustration out of the\r\nhistory of Freemasonry.\r\n\r\nIn his _Maçonnerie Occulte_, Ragon, an illustrious and learned Belgian\r\nMason, rightly or wrongly reproaches the English Masons with having\r\nmaterialized and dishonoured Masonry, once based upon the Ancient\r\nMysteries, by adopting, owing to a mistaken notion of the origin of the\r\ncraft, the name of “Free Masonry” and “Free Masons.” The mistake is due,\r\nhe says, to those who connect Masonry with the _building_ of Solomon’s\r\nTemple. He derides the idea, and says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Frenchman knew well, when he adopted the title of Freemason,\r\n    that it was no question of building the smallest wall, but that,\r\n    initiated into the Mysteries veiled under the name of Freemasonry,\r\n    which could only be the continuation or the renovation of the\r\n    ancient Mysteries, he was to become a “Mason” after the manner of\r\n    Apollo or Amphion. And do not we know that the ancient initiated\r\n    poets, when speaking of the _foundation of a city_, meant thereby\r\n    the establishment of a doctrine? Thus Neptune, God of reasoning,\r\n    and Apollo, God of hidden things, presented themselves as masons\r\n    before Laomedon, Priam’s father, to help him to build the city of\r\n    Troy—that is to say, to establish the Trojan religion.(1859)\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch veiled sentences with double meaning abound in ancient classical\r\nwriters. Therefore, if an attempt had been made to show that, for\r\ninstance, Laomedon was the founder of a branch of Archaic Mysteries, in\r\nwhich the earth‐bound material soul, the Fourth Principle, was personified\r\nin Menelaus’ faithless wife, the fair Helen, and if Ragon had not come to\r\ncorroborate what we asserted, we might have been told that no classical\r\nauthor speaks of it, and that Homer shows Laomedon building a _city_, not\r\nfounding an _Esoteric Worship_ or _Mysteries_. Who are those left now,\r\nsave a few Initiates, who understand the language and correct meaning of\r\nsuch symbolical terms?\r\n\r\nBut though we have pointed to many a misconceived symbol bearing on our\r\nthesis, there still remains more than one difficulty to be overcome. Most\r\nimportant among several such obstacles is that of chronology. But this\r\ncould hardly be helped. Wedged in between theological chronology and that\r\nof the Geologists, backed by all the materialistic Anthropologists, who\r\nassign dates to man and nature which fit in with their own theories\r\nalone—what could the writer do except what she has done? Since Theology\r\nplaces the Deluge 2448 B.C., and the World’s Creation only 5890 years ago;\r\nand since the accurate researches by the methods of “exact” Science, have\r\nled the Geologists and Physicists to assign to the incrusted age of our\r\nGlobe between ten million and one thousand million of years(1860) (a\r\n_trifling_ difference, verily!); and since the Anthropologists, to vary\r\ntheir divergence of opinion as to the appearance of man, ask for between\r\n25,000 and 500,000 years—what can one who studies the Occult Doctrine do,\r\nbut bravely present the Esoteric calculations before the world?\r\n\r\nBut to do this, corroboration by even a few “historical” proofs has been\r\nnecessary, though all know the real value of the so‐called “historical\r\nevidence.” For, whether man appeared on Earth 18,000 or 18,000,000 years\r\nago, can make no difference to profane history, since it only begins about\r\na couple of thousand years before our era, and since, even then, it\r\ngrapples hopelessly with the clash and din of contradictory and mutually‐\r\ndestroying opinions around it. Nevertheless, in view of the respect in\r\nwhich the average reader has been brought up for exact Science, even that\r\nshort Past would remain meaningless, unless the Esoteric Teachings were\r\ncorroborated and supported on the spot—_whenever possible_—by references\r\nto historical names of a so‐called historical period. This is the only\r\nguide that can be given to the beginner before he is permitted to start\r\namong the, to him, unfamiliar windings of that dark labyrinth called the\r\npre‐historic ages. This necessity has been complied with. It is only hoped\r\nthat the desire to do so, which has led the writer to be constantly\r\nbringing ancient and modern evidence as a corroboration of the archaic and\r\nquite unhistoric Past, will not bring on her the accusation of having\r\nsorely jumbled up, without order or method, the various and widely‐\r\nseparated periods of history and tradition. But literary form and method\r\nhad to be sacrificed to the greater clearness of the general exposition.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish the proposed task, the writer has had to resort to the\r\nrather unusual means of dividing each Volume into three Parts; the first\r\nof which only is the consecutive, though very fragmentary, history of the\r\nCosmogony and the Evolution of Man on this Globe. In treating of Cosmogony\r\nand then of the Anthropogenesis of mankind, it was necessary to show that\r\non religion, from the very earliest, has ever been based entirely on\r\nfiction, that none was the object of special revelation, and that it is\r\ndogma alone which has ever been killing primeval truth; finally, that no\r\nhuman‐born doctrine, no creed, however sanctified by custom and antiquity,\r\ncan compare in sacredness with the religion of Nature. The Key of Wisdom\r\nthat unlocks the massive gates leading to the arcana of the innermost\r\nsanctuaries can be found hidden in her bosom only; and that bosom is in\r\nthe countries pointed to by the great seer of the past century, Emanuel\r\nSwedenborg. There lies the Heart of Nature, that shrine whence issued the\r\nearly races of primeval humanity, and which is the cradle of _physical_\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThus far have proceeded the rough outlines of the beliefs and tenets of\r\nthe archaic, earliest Races, contained in their hitherto secret scriptural\r\nRecords. But our explanations are by no means complete, nor do they\r\npretend to give out the full text, or to have been read by the help of\r\nmore than three or four keys out of the sevenfold bunch of Esoteric\r\ninterpretation; and even this has only been partially accomplished. The\r\nwork is too gigantic for any one person to undertake, far more to\r\naccomplish. Our main concern has been simply to prepare the soil. This, we\r\ntrust we have done. These two Volumes only constitute the work of a\r\npioneer who has forced his way into the well‐nigh impenetrable jungle of\r\nthe virgin forests of the Land of the Occult. A commencement has been made\r\nin felling and uprooting the deadly upas trees of superstition, prejudice,\r\nand conceited ignorance, so that these two Volumes should form for the\r\nstudent a fitting prelude for other works. Until the rubbish of the ages\r\nis cleared away from the minds of the Theosophists to whom these pages are\r\ndedicated, it is impossible that the more practical teaching contained in\r\nthe Third Volume should be understood. Consequently, it entirely depends\r\nupon the reception with which Volumes I and II shall meet at the hands of\r\nTheosophists and Mystics, whether the last Volume will ever be published.\r\n\r\nSATYÂT NÂSTI PARO DHARMAH.\r\n\r\nTHERE IS NO RELIGION HIGHER THAN TRUTH.\r\n\r\nEND OF VOLUME II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber’s Note: Obvious printer’s errors have been corrected.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n    1 See _Genesis_ ii. 19. Adam is formed in verse 7, and in verse 19 it\r\n      is said: “Out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the\r\n      field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see\r\n      what he would call them.” Thus man was created _before_ the animals;\r\n      for the animals mentioned in chapter i are the signs of the Zodiac,\r\n      while the man, “male and female,” is not man, but the Host of the\r\n      Sephiroth, Forces, or Angels, “made in his [God’s] image and after\r\n      his likeness.” The Adam, man, is not made in that likeness, nor is\r\n      it so asserted in the _Bible_. Moreover, the Second Adam is\r\n      Esoterically a septenary which represents seven men, or rather\r\n      groups of men. For the first Adam, the Kadmon, is the synthesis of\r\n      the _ten_ Sephiroth. Of these, the upper Triad remains in the\r\n      Archetypal World as the future “Trinity,” while the seven lower\r\n      Sephiroth create the manifested material world; and this septennate\r\n      is the Second Adam. _Genesis_, and the mysteries upon which it was\r\n      fabricated, came from Egypt. The “God” of the 1st chapter of\r\n      _Genesis_ is the Logos, and the “Lord God” of the 2nd chapter the\r\n      Creative Elohim, the lower Powers.\r\n\r\n    2 Thus saith Pymander: “This is the mystery that to this day was\r\n      hidden. Nature being mingled with the Heavenly Man [Elohim, or\r\n      Dhyânis], brought forth a wonder ... seven Men, all males and\r\n      females [Hermaphrodite] ... according to the nature of the seven\r\n      Governors” (ii. 29), or the seven Hosts of the Pitris or Elohim, who\r\n      projected or created him. This is very clear, but yet, see the\r\n      interpretations of even our modern theologians, men supposed to be\r\n      intellectual and learned. In the _Theological and Philosophical\r\n      Works of Hermes Trismegistus, Christian [?] Neoplatonist_, a work\r\n      compiled by John David Chambers, of Oriel College, Oxford, the\r\n      translator wonders “for whom these seven Men are intended?” He\r\n      solves the difficulty by concluding that, as “the original pattern\r\n      Man [Adam Kadmon of _Genesis_ i] was masculine‐feminine, ... the\r\n      seven may signify the succeeding patriarchs named in _Genesis_” (p.\r\n      9).

It is simply another version\r\n      of the same story.\r\n\r\n    7 _Philosophumena_, v. 7; Miller’s edition, p. 98.\r\n\r\n    8 _Ibid._, p. 108.\r\n\r\n    9 P. 86.\r\n\r\n   10 See Pliny, iv, c. 12; Strabo, 10; Herodotus, vii, c. 109; Pausanias,\r\n      vii, c. 4, etc.\r\n\r\n   11 _Chaldean Account of Genesis_, p. 82.\r\n\r\n   12 See _Bund._, 79, 12.\r\n\r\n   13 By “original” we mean the Amshaspend, called “Zarathushtra, the lord\r\n      and ruler of the Vara made by Yima in that land.” There were several\r\n      Zarathushtras or Zertusts, the _Dabistan_ alone enumerating\r\n      thirteen; but these were all reincarnations of the first one. The\r\n      last Zoroaster was the founder of the Fire‐temple of Azareksh, and\r\n      the writer of the works on the primeval sacred Magian religion\r\n      destroyed by Alexander.\r\n\r\n   14 In India called a “Day of Brahmâ.”\r\n\r\n   15 x. 86.\r\n\r\n   16 See Volcker, _Mythological Geography_, pp. 145 to 170.\r\n\r\n   17 _Mythical Monsters_, p. 47.\r\n\r\n   18 It is to be remarked, however, that Mr. Wallace does not accept Mr.\r\n      Sclater’s idea, and even opposes it. Mr. Sclater supposes a land or\r\n      continent formerly uniting Africa, Madagascar, and India but not\r\n      Australia and India; and Mr. A. R. Wallace shows, in his\r\n      _Geographical Distribution of Animals_ and _Island Life_, that the\r\n      hypothesis of such a land is quite uncalled for on the alleged\r\n      zoological grounds. But he admits that a much closer proximity of\r\n      India and Australia did certainly exist, and at a time so very\r\n      remote that it was “certainly pre‐tertiary,” adding in a private\r\n      letter that “no name has been given to this supposed land.” Yet the\r\n      land did exist, and was of course “pre‐tertiary,” for Lemuria, if we\r\n      accept this name for the third Continent, had perished before\r\n      Atlantis fully developed, and Atlantis had sunk and its chief\r\n      portions disappeared before the end of the Miocene period.\r\n\r\n   19 See _Esoteric Buddhism_.\r\n\r\n   20 One more “coincidence”:\r\n\r\n      “Now it is proved that in geologically recent times, this region of\r\n      North Africa was in fact a peninsula of Spain, and that its union\r\n      with Africa (proper) was effected on the North by the rupture of\r\n      Gibraltar, and on the South by an upheaval to which the Sahara owes\r\n      its existence. The shores of this former sea of Sahara are still\r\n      marked by the shells of the same Gastropoda that live on the shores\r\n      of the Mediterranean.” (Prof. Oscar Schmidt, _Doctrine of Descent\r\n      and Darwinism_, p. 244.)\r\n\r\n   21 iii. fol. 10a.\r\n\r\n   22 A.

It seems like a hopeless task to succeed in\r\n      quoting a single set of figures from one work, without the risk of\r\n      finding it contradicted by the same author in an earlier or a\r\n      subsequent volume. Sir William Thomson, one of the most eminent\r\n      among the modern authorities, has changed his opinion about half‐a‐\r\n      dozen times upon the age of the Sun and the date of the\r\n      consolidation of the Earth’s crust. In Thomson and Tait’s _Natural\r\n      Philosophy_, we find only ten million years allowed since the time\r\n      when the temperature of the Earth permitted vegetable life to appear\r\n      on it. (App. E _et seq._; also _Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._, xxiii. Pt.\r\n      1, 157, 1862, where 847 is cancelled.) Mr. Darwin gives Sir William\r\n      Thomson’s estimate as “a minimum of 98 and a maximum of 200 millions\r\n      of years since the consolidation of the crust.” (See Ch. Gould, _op.\r\n      cit._, p. 83.) In the same work (_Nat. Phil._) 80 millions are given\r\n      from the time of incipient incrustation to the present state of the\r\n      world. And in his last lecture, as shown elsewhere, Sir William\r\n      Thomson declares (1887) that the Sun is not older than 15 millions\r\n      of years! Meanwhile, basing his arguments as to the limits of the\r\n      age of the Sun’s heat, on figures previously established by Sir\r\n      William Thomson, Mr. Croll allows 60 millions of years since the\r\n      beginning of the Cambrian period. This is hopeful for the lovers of\r\n      _exact_ knowledge. Thus, whatever figures are given by Occult\r\n      Science, they are sure to be corroborated by those of some one among\r\n      the modern men of Science who are considered as authorities.\r\n\r\n   25 See _Proceedings_, Royal Society, London, xxviii. 281.\r\n\r\n   26 Gould, _Mythical Monsters_, p. 91.\r\n\r\n   27 Only forty‐nine Shlokas out of several hundred are here given, and\r\n      not every verse is translated verbatim, a periphrasis being\r\n      sometimes used for the sake of clearness and intelligibility, where\r\n      a literal translation would be quite unintelligible.\r\n\r\n   28 The idea and the spirit of the sentence only is here given, as a\r\n      verbal translation would convey very little to the reader.\r\n\r\n   29 The Fourth Globe, or our Earth. All the glosses on the translation\r\n      of the text of the Stanzas and Commentaries are the writer’s. In\r\n      some places they may be incomplete and even inadequate from the\r\n      Hindû standpoint; but in the meaning attached to them in Trans‐\r\n      Himâlayan Esotericism they are correct. In every case the writer\r\n      takes any blame upon herself. As she has never claimed personal\r\n      infallibility, that which is given on her own authority may leave\r\n      much to be desired, particularly in the very abstruse cases where\r\n      too deep metaphysic is involved. The teaching is offered as it is\r\n      understood; and seeing that there are seven keys of interpretation\r\n      to every symbol and allegory, a meaning which may not be suitable\r\n      from, say, the psychological or astronomical aspect, will\r\n      nevertheless be found quite correct from the physical or\r\n      metaphysical.\r\n\r\n   30 The Planetary Spirits.\r\n\r\n   31 Loka Chakshus.\r\n\r\n   32 The Planets.\r\n\r\n   33 According to Dr. A. Wilder’s learned definition, Genesis, γένεσις,\r\n      is not generation, but “_a coming out of the eternal_ into the\r\n      Cosmos and Time”; “a coming from _esse_ into _exsistere_,” or from\r\n      “Be‐ness” into “Being”—as a Theosophist would say.\r\n\r\n   34 For a clearer explanation of the origins, as contained in the\r\n      Esotericism of the _Bhagavad Gita_, see the Notes thereon published\r\n      in _The Theosophist_ for February, March and June, 1887, Madras.\r\n\r\n   35 See the Sephirothal Tree.\r\n\r\n   36 _Zohar_, _Idra Suta_, Sec.

Alden; New York, 1888: ii. 432, 434.\r\n\r\n   38 It has been repeatedly stated that the Serpent is the symbol of\r\n      wisdom and of Occult knowledge. “The Serpent has been connected with\r\n      the god of wisdom from the earliest times of which we have any\r\n      historical notice,” writes C. Staniland Wake. “This animal was the\r\n      especial symbol of Thoth or Taut ... and of all those gods, such as\r\n      Hermes [?] and Seth who can be connected with him. This is true also\r\n      of the third member of the primitive Chaldæan triad, Hea or Hoa.”\r\n      According to Sir Henry Rawlinson, “the most important titles of this\r\n      deity refer to ‘his functions as the source of all knowledge and\r\n      science.’ Not only is he ‘the intelligent fish,’ but his name may be\r\n      read as signifying both ‘life’ and a ‘serpent’ [an initiated Adept],\r\n      and he may be considered as ‘figured by the great serpent which\r\n      occupies so conspicuous a place among the symbols of the gods on the\r\n      black stones recording Babylonian benefactions.’ ” (_The Great\r\n      Pyramid_, p. 75). Esculapius, Serapis, Pluto, Esmun and Kneph, are\r\n      all deities with the attributes of the serpent, says Dupuis. They\r\n      are all _healers_, givers of health, spiritual and physical, and of\r\n      _enlightenment_. The crown formed of an asp, the Thermuthis belongs\r\n      to Isis, Goddess of Life and Healing. The _Upanishads_ have a\r\n      treatise on the _Science of Serpents_—in other words, the Science of\r\n      Occult Knowledge; and the Nâgas of the exoteric Buddhist are not\r\n      “the fabulous creatures, of the nature of serpents ... being\r\n      superior to man, and regarded as protectors of the law of Buddha,”\r\n      as Schlagintweit believes, but real living men, some superior to men\r\n      by virtue of their Occult Knowledge, and the _protectors of Buddha’s\r\n      law_, inasmuch as _they interpret his metaphysical tenets\r\n      correctly_, others inferior _morally_ as being “black magicians.”\r\n      Therefore it is truly declared that Gautama Buddha “is said to have\r\n      taught them a more philosophical religious system than to men, who\r\n      were not sufficiently advanced to understand it at the time of his\r\n      appearance” (_ibid._, p. 72).\r\n\r\n   39 Compare the _Symbols of the Bonzes_.\r\n\r\n   40 The Mandragora is the Mandrake of the _Bible_, of Rachel and Leah.\r\n      The roots of the plant are fleshy, hairy, and forked, representing\r\n      roughly the limbs, the body, and even head of a man. Its magical and\r\n      mysterious properties have been proclaimed in fable and play from\r\n      the most archaic ages. From Rachel and Leah, who indulged in\r\n      witchcraft with them, down to Shakespeare, who speaks of\r\n      “shrieking”—\r\n\r\n      “Like mandrakes torn out of the earth\r\n      That living mortals, hearing them, run mad”\r\n\r\n      —the mandragora was _the_ magic plant _par excellence_.\r\n\r\n      These roots are without any apparent stalk, large leaves growing out\r\n      of the head of the root, like a gigantic crop of hair. They present\r\n      little similitude to man when found in Spain, Italy, Asia Minor, or\r\n      Syria, but on the Isle of Candia, and in Karamania near the city of\r\n      Adan, they have a wonderfully human form, and are very highly prized\r\n      as amulets. They are also worn by women as a charm against\r\n      sterility, and for other purposes. They are especially effective in\r\n      “Black Magic.”\r\n\r\n   41 The Sun.\r\n\r\n   42 Earth.\r\n\r\n   43 Copernicus wrote his theories on the “Revolution of the Heavenly\r\n      Bodies” in the sixteenth century, and the _Zohar_, even if compiled\r\n      by Moses de Leon in the thirteenth century, states that:\r\n\r\n      “In the Book of Hammannunah, the Old (or, the Ancient), we learn ...\r\n      that the earth turns upon itself in the form of a circle; that some\r\n      are on top, the others below; that ... there are some countries of\r\n      the earth which are lightened, whilst others are in darkness; these\r\n      have the day, when for the former it is night; and there are\r\n      countries in which it is constantly day, or in which at least the\r\n      night continues only some instants.” (_Zohar_, iii, fol. 10a, quoted\r\n      in Myer’s _Qabbalah_, p. 139.)\r\n\r\n   44 See also the 21st Fargard of the _Vendídád_ on the celestial\r\n      militia.\r\n\r\n   45 _Idolat._, II. 373.\r\n\r\n   46 Science teaches that Venus receives from the Sun twice as much light\r\n      and heat as the Earth. Thus this Planet, precursor of the dawn and\r\n      the twilight, the most radiant of all the Planets, is said to give\r\n      the Earth one‐third of the supply she receives, and has two parts\r\n      left for herself. This has an Occult as well as an astronomical\r\n      meaning.\r\n\r\n   47 “As it is above, so below,” is the fundamental axiom of Occult\r\n      Philosophy. As the Logos is seven‐fold, _i.e._, throughout Kosmos it\r\n      appears as seven Logoi under seven different forms, or, as taught by\r\n      learned Brâhmans, “each of these is the central figure of one of the\r\n      seven main branches of the ancient Wisdom Religion”; and, as the\r\n      seven principles which correspond to the seven distinct states of\r\n      Prajnâ, or Consciousness, are allied to seven states of Matter and\r\n      seven forms of Force, the division must be the same in all that\r\n      concerns the Earth.\r\n\r\n   48 Venus is thus ♀, the Earth ♁.\r\n\r\n   49 In the Esoteric Philosophy it is male and female, or hermaphrodite;\r\n      hence the “bearded” Venus in mythology.\r\n\r\n   50 Therefore, putting aside its religio‐metaphysical aspect, the Cross\r\n      of the Christians is symbolically far more phallic than the Pagan\r\n      Svastika. Compare vol. i. pp. 34, 35.\r\n\r\n   51 The ansated cross is the astronomical planetary sign of Venus,\r\n      “signifying the existence of _parturient energy_ in the sexual\r\n      sense, and this was one of the attributes of Isis, the Mother, of\r\n      Eve, Hauvah, or Mother‐Earth, and was so recognized among all the\r\n      ancient peoples in one or another mode of expression.” (From a\r\n      modern Kabalistic MS.)\r\n\r\n   52 See Moore’s _Hindû Pantheon_.\r\n\r\n   53 Athenæus shows that the first letter of Satan’s name was represented\r\n      in days of old by an arc and crescent; and some Roman Catholics,\r\n      kind, good men, would persuade the public that it is in honour of\r\n      Lucifer’s crescent‐like horns that Mussulmans have chosen the\r\n      crescent for their national arms. Venus, ever since the\r\n      establishment of Roman Catholic dogmatism, has been identified with\r\n      Satan and Lucifer, or the Great Dragon, contrary to all reason and\r\n      logic. As shown by symbologists and Astronomers:\r\n\r\n      “The association between the serpent and the idea of darkness had an\r\n      astronomical foundation. The position which the constellation Draco\r\n      at one time occupied showed that the Great Serpent was the ruler of\r\n      the night. This constellation was formerly at the very centre of the\r\n      heavens, and is so extensive that it was called the Great Dragon.\r\n      Its body spreads over seven signs of the Zodiac; and Dupuis, who\r\n      sees in the Dragon of the Apocalypse a reference to the celestial\r\n      serpent, says, ‘It is not astonishing that a constellation so\r\n      extended should be represented by the author of that book as a great\r\n      dragon with seven heads, who drew the third part of the stars from\r\n      heaven and cast them to the earth.’ ” (Staniland Wake, _The Great\r\n      Pyramid_, p. 79; Dupuis, iii. 255.)\r\n\r\n      Only Dupuis never knew _why_ Draco, once the pole‐star—the symbol of\r\n      Guide, Guru and Director—had been thus degraded by posterity. “The\r\n      Gods of our fathers are our devils,” says an Asiatic proverb. When\r\n      Draco ceased to be the “lode‐star,” the guiding sidereal divinity,\r\n      it shared the fate of all the fallen Gods. Seth and Typhon was at\r\n      one time, Bunsen tells us, “a great God universally adored\r\n      throughout Egypt, who conferred on the sovereigns of the 18th and\r\n      19th Dynasties the symbols of life and power. But subsequently, in\r\n      the course of the 20th Dynasty, he is suddenly treated as an evil\r\n      Demon, insomuch that his effigies and name are obliterated on all\r\n      the monuments and inscriptions that could be reached.” The real\r\n      Occult reason will be given in these pages.\r\n\r\n   54 _De Civitate Dei_, LXXI. viii.\r\n\r\n   55 Shukra is the son of Bhrigu the great Rishi, and one of the Seven\r\n      Prajâpati, the founder of the Race of Bhârgavas, in which Parashu\r\n      Râma is born.\r\n\r\n   56 This is a flat contradiction of Swedenborg, who _saw_, in “the first\r\n      Earth of the Astral World,” inhabitants dressed as are the peasants\r\n      in Europe; and on the Fourth Earth women clad as are the\r\n      shepherdesses in a _bal masqué_! Even the famous astronomer Huygens\r\n      laboured under the mistaken idea that other worlds and planets have\r\n      species of beings identical with those who live on our Earth,\r\n      possessing the same figures, senses, brain‐power, arts, sciences,\r\n      dwellings, even to the same fabric for their wearing apparel!\r\n      (_Théorie du Monde._)\r\n\r\n   57 This is a modern gloss. It is added to the old Commentaries for the\r\n      clearer comprehension of those disciples who study Esoteric\r\n      Cosmogony after having passed through Western learning. The earlier\r\n      Glosses are too redundant with adjectives and figures of speech to\r\n      be easily assimilated.\r\n\r\n   58 “Beyond” the Great Range, means, in this case, India, as being the\r\n      Trans‐Himâlayan region for the Tibetan region.\r\n\r\n   59 The term Pitris is used by us in these Shlokas to facilitate their\r\n      comprehension, but it is not so used in the original Stanzas, where\r\n      they have distinct appellations of their own, besides being called\r\n      “Fathers” and “Progenitors.”\r\n\r\n   60 It is erroneous to take literally the _worship_ of the human\r\n      Bodhisattvas, or Manjushrî. It is true that, exoterically, the\r\n      Mahâyâna school teaches adoration of these without distinction, and\r\n      that Huien‐Tsang speaks of some disciples of Buddha as being\r\n      worshipped. But, Esoterically, it is not the disciple or the learned\r\n      Manjushrî _personally_ that received honours, but the divine\r\n      Bodhisattvas and Dhyâni‐Buddhas that animated (_amilakha_, as the\r\n      Mongolians say) the human forms.\r\n\r\n   61 The author of this work is Augustus Le Plongeon. He and his wife are\r\n      well known in the United States for their untiring labours in\r\n      Central America. It is they who discovered the sepulchre of the\r\n      royal Kan Coh, at Cichen‐Itza. The author seems to believe and to\r\n      seek to prove that the Esoteric learning of the Âryans and the\r\n      Egyptians was derived from the Mayas. But, although certainly coëval\r\n      with Plato’s Atlantis, the Mayas belonged to the Fifth Continent,\r\n      which was preceded by Atlantis and Lemuria.\r\n\r\n   62 More correctly _In Matrem Deorum_, _Oratio_ v.\r\n\r\n   63 P. 143.\r\n\r\n   64 These _seven caves_, _seven cities_, etc., etc., stand in every case\r\n      for the seven centres, or zones, upon which the seven primitive\r\n      groups of the first Root‐Race were born.\r\n\r\n   65 The engraving is reproduced in the _Sacred Mysteries of the Mayas\r\n      and the Quiches_ on p. 134.\r\n\r\n   66 See _Source of Measures_, p. 50‐53.\r\n\r\n   67 See _Isis Unveiled_, II. pp. 300 _et seq._, for a proof of the\r\n      antiquity of the decimal system of figures.\r\n\r\n   68 See _Masonic Review_, Cincinnati, June, 1886, Art. “The\r\n      Cabbalah.—No. VI,” p. 10.\r\n\r\n   69 _Ibid._, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n   70 _Ibid._, p. 11.\r\n\r\n   71 See _Source of Measures_, pp. 276, _et seq._, App. VII.\r\n\r\n   72 Art., _Masonic Review_, pp. 11, 12.\r\n\r\n   73 In the Book _Al‐Chazari_, by Jehuda‐ha‐Levi, translated by Dr. D.\r\n      Cassel.\r\n\r\n   74 Art. cited, pp. 12, 13.\r\n\r\n   75 i. pp. 117 _et seq._\r\n\r\n   76 Art. cited, p. 2.\r\n\r\n   77 _Ibid._, p. 14.\r\n\r\n   78 The appellation _Ak‐ad_ (or Akkadians) is of the same class as _Ad‐\r\n      m_, _Ha‐va_ (Eve) _Æd‐en_ (Eden); _Ak‐Ad_ meaning “Son of _Ad_,”\r\n      like the sons of Ad in Ancient Arabia. _Ad‐ad_, the “only one” and\r\n      the “first,” was the _Ad‐on_ or “Lord” of Syria and consort of _Ad‐\r\n      ar‐gat_ or Aster’t, the Syrian Goddess. And Gan‐Æden (Eden) or\r\n      Gandunia was Babylonia and Mesopotamia. In Assyrian _Ak_ meant\r\n      Creator, the letter _k_ being pronounced _kh_ (_ah_) gutturally.\r\n      According to Swedenborg’s mysticism Adam was not a man but a church\r\n      (?) of primitive light. In the _Vedas_, _Ad_‐iti is the primitive\r\n      light, the Âkâsha of the phenomenal world.\r\n\r\n   79 Adam‐Jehovah, Brahmâ and Mars are, in one sense, identical; they are\r\n      all symbols for primitive or initial _generative powers_ for the\r\n      purposes of human procreation. Adam is red, and so also are\r\n      Brahmâ‐Virâj and Mars—God and Planet. Water is the “blood” of the\r\n      Earth; therefore, all these names are connected with Earth and\r\n      Water. “It takes _earth_ and _water_ to create a _human_ soul,” says\r\n      Moses. Mars is identical with Kârttikeya, God of War (in one\r\n      sense)—which God is born of the Sweat of Shiva, Shiva‐gharmaja and\r\n      the Earth. In the _Mahâbhârata_ he is shown as born without the\r\n      intervention of a woman. And he is also called Lohita, the Red, like\r\n      Adam, and the other “first men.” Hence, the author of _The Source of\r\n      Measures_ is quite right in thinking that Mars (and all the other\r\n      Gods of like attributes), “being the _god of war_ and of\r\n      _bloodshed_, was but a secondary idea flowing out of the primary one\r\n      of shedding of blood in conception for the first time.” Hence\r\n      Jehovah became later a fighting God, “Lord of Hosts,” and one who\r\n      commands war. He is the aggressive Zodh—or Cain, by permutation, who\r\n      _slew_ his (female) _brother_, whose “blood crieth from the ground,”\r\n      the _Earth_ having opened _her mouth_ to receive the _blood_.\r\n      (_Genesis_ iii.)\r\n\r\n   80 Apollo Karneios is certainly a Greek transformation from the Hindû\r\n      Krishna‐Karna. Karna means radiant, and Karneios, which was a title\r\n      of Apollo with the Celts as with the Greeks, meant “Sun‐born.”\r\n\r\n   81 Kumuda‐Pati.\r\n\r\n   82 Pitri‐Pati.\r\n\r\n   83 Budha, Mercury.\r\n\r\n   84 The Moon.\r\n\r\n   85 Ushanas‐Shukra, or Venus, is our Lucifer, the Morning‐Star, of\r\n      course. The ingenuity of this allegory in its manifold meanings is\r\n      great indeed. Thus Brihaspati (the Planet Jupiter), or\r\n      Brahmanaspati, is, in the _Rig Veda_, a deity who is the symbol and\r\n      the prototype of the _exoteric_ or ritualistic worship. He is\r\n      priest, sacrificer, suppliant, and the medium through which the\r\n      prayers of mortals reach the Gods. He is the Purohita (Family\r\n      Priest, or Court Chaplain) of the Hindû Olympus and the spiritual\r\n      Guru of the Gods. Soma is the Mystery God and presides over the\r\n      mystic and Occult nature in man and the Universe. Târâ, the priest’s\r\n      wife, who symbolizes the worshipper, prefers Esoteric truths to\r\n      their mere shell, exotericism; hence she is shown as carried off by\r\n      Soma. Now Soma is the sacred juice of that name, giving mystic\r\n      visions and trance revelations, the _result of which union_ is Budha\r\n      (Wisdom), Mercury, Hermes, etc.; that Science in short which to this\r\n      day is proclaimed by the Brihaspatis of Theology as Devilish and\r\n      Satanic. What wonder that by expanding the cycle of this allegory we\r\n      find Christian Theology espousing the quarrel of the Hindû Gods, and\r\n      regarding Ushanas (Lucifer), who helped Soma against that ancient\r\n      personification of ritualistic worship (Brahmanaspati, the Lord of\r\n      the Brâhmans, now become Jupiter‐Jehovah) as Satan, the “Enemy of\r\n      God”!\r\n\r\n   86 As shown elsewhere, it is only the Heavenly Man, Adam‐Kadmon, of the\r\n      first chapter of _Genesis_, who is made “in the image and likeness\r\n      of God.” Adam of the second chapter is not said to be made in that\r\n      _image_ nor in the divine likeness, before he ate of the forbidden\r\n      fruit. The former Adam is the Sephirothal Host; the second Adam is\r\n      the mindless First human Root‐Race; the third Adam is the Race that\r\n      separated, whose eyes are opened.\r\n\r\n   87 The Earth.\r\n\r\n   88 Achyuta is an almost untranslatable term. It means that which is not\r\n      subject to fall or change for the worse: the Unfalling; and it is\r\n      the reverse of Chyuta, the Fallen. The Dhyânîs who incarnate in the\r\n      human forms of the Third Root‐Race and endow them with intellect\r\n      (Manas) are called the Chyuta for they fall into generation.\r\n\r\n   89 This is perhaps the reason why, in the _Bhagavad Gîtâ_, we are told\r\n      that Brahmâ had communicated to Nârada in the beginning that all men\r\n      whatsoever, even Mlechchhas, outcasts and barbarians, might know the\r\n      true nature of Vâsudeva and learn to have faith in that Deity.\r\n\r\n   90 See _Asiatic Researches_, i. 265.\r\n\r\n   91 _Book of God_, 60.\r\n\r\n   92 Shesha, who is also Ananta, the infinite, and the “Cycle of\r\n      Eternity” in Esotericism, is credited with having given his\r\n      astronomical knowledge to Garga, the oldest astronomer of India, who\r\n      propitiated him, and forthwith knew all about the Planets and how to\r\n      read omens.\r\n\r\n   93 See _The History of Indian Literature_, p. 253, by Prof. A.

The Chinese have the same\r\n      traditions. According to the commentator Kwoh P’oh, in the work\r\n      called _Shan‐Hai‐King_, “Wonders by Sea and Land,” a work which was\r\n      written by the historiographer Chung Ku from engravings on nine urns\r\n      made by the Emperor Yü (B.C. 2255), an interview is mentioned with\r\n      men _having two distinct faces on their heads_, before and behind,\r\n      monsters with bodies of goats and human faces, etc. Gould, in his\r\n      _Mythical Monsters_ (p. 27), giving the names of some authors on\r\n      Natural History, mentions _Shan‐Hai‐King_. “According to the\r\n      commentator Kwoh P’oh (A.D. 276‐324) this work was compiled three\r\n      thousand years before his time, or at seven dynasties’ distance.\r\n      Yang Sun of the Ming Dynasty (commencing A.D. 1368) states that it\r\n      was compiled by Kung Chia and Chung Ku (?)”—as stated above. “Chung\r\n      Ku ... at the time of the last emperor of the Hia dynasty (B.C.\r\n      1818), fearing that the emperor might destroy the books treating of\r\n      the ancient time, carried them in his flight to Yin.”\r\n\r\n  108 Cory’s _Ancient Fragments_, original edition, p. 25.\r\n\r\n  109 _Qabbalah_, p. 246.\r\n\r\n  110 From the mineral, vegetable, and animal remains.\r\n\r\n  111 Rounds.\r\n\r\n  112 Solar‐lunar.\r\n\r\n  113 Gods and Planetary Spirits, especially the Ribhus. “The three\r\n      Ribhus” who also become “thrice seven” in number of their gifts.\r\n\r\n  114 Remember the “winged races” of Plato, and the _Popol Vuh_ accounts\r\n      of the first human race, which could walk, fly, and see objects,\r\n      however distant.\r\n\r\n  115 See _Mythical Monsters_, by Charles Gould.\r\n\r\n  116 In the first volume of the lately published _Introduction à l’Étude\r\n      des Races Humaines_, by M. de Quatrefages, there is proof that since\r\n      the Post‐Tertiary Period and even before that time—since many Races\r\n      were already scattered during that Age on the face of the Earth—man\r\n      has not altered one iota in his physical structure. And if man was\r\n      surrounded for ages by a fauna that altered from one period or cycle\r\n      to another, which died out, which was reborn in other forms—so that\r\n      now there does not exist one single animal on Earth, large or small,\r\n      contemporary with the man of that period—if, then, every animal has\r\n      been transformed save man himself, this fact goes to prove not only\r\n      his antiquity, but that he is a _distinct Kingdom_. Why should he\r\n      alone have escaped transformation? Because, says de Quatrefages, the\r\n      weapon used by him, in his struggle with Nature, and the ever‐\r\n      changing geological conditions and elements, was “his _psychic\r\n      force_, not his physical strength or body,” as in the case of\r\n      animals. Give man only that dose of intelligence and reason with\r\n      which other mammalia are endowed, and with his present bodily\r\n      organization he will show himself the most helpless of creatures of\r\n      Earth. And as everything goes to prove that the human organism with\r\n      all its characteristics, peculiarities and idiosyncrasies existed\r\n      already on our Globe in those far distant geological periods when\r\n      there was not yet _one single specimen of the now‐existing forms of\r\n      mammalia_, what is the unavoidable conclusion? Why this: Since all\r\n      the human races are of one and the same species, it follows that\r\n      this species is the _most ancient of all_ the now‐living mammalia.\r\n      Therefore it is the most stable and persevering of all, and was\r\n      already as fully developed as it is now when all the other mammalia\r\n      now known had not made even their first approach to appearance on\r\n      this Earth. Such is the opinion of the great French Naturalist, who\r\n      gives thereby a terrible blow to Darwinism.\r\n\r\n  117 They said.\r\n\r\n  118 The Monads of the “presentments” of men of the Third Round, the huge\r\n      ape‐like forms.\r\n\r\n  119 The Waters.\r\n\r\n  120 In the Esoteric System the seven “principles” in man are represented\r\n      by seven letters. The first two are _more_ sacred than the four\r\n      letters of the Tetragrammaton.\r\n\r\n  121 The Intermediate Spheres, wherein the Monads, which have not reached\r\n      Nirvâna, are said to slumber in unconscious inactivity between the\r\n      Manvantaras.\r\n\r\n  122 Explained elsewhere. The Three Fires, Pâvaka, Pavamâna, and Shuchi,\r\n      who had forty‐five Sons, who, with their three Fathers, and their\r\n      Father Agni, constitute the forty‐nine Fires. Pavamâna, Fire\r\n      produced by friction, is the parent of the “Fire of the Asuras”;\r\n      Shuchi, Solar Fire, is the parent of the “Fire of the Gods”; and\r\n      Pâvaka, Electric Fire, is the Father of the “Fire of the Pitris.”\r\n      (See _Vâyu Purâna_.) But this is an explanation on the material and\r\n      terrestrial plane. The Flames are evanescent and only periodical;\r\n      the Fires—eternal in their triple unity. They correspond to the\r\n      _four_ lower, and the _three_ higher human “principles.”\r\n\r\n  123 The Suras, who become later the A‐Suras.\r\n\r\n  124 Âtmâ, Buddhi and Manas. In Devachan the higher element of the Manas\r\n      is needed to make it a state of perception and consciousness for the\r\n      disembodied Monad.\r\n\r\n  125 _Catechism_, Book iii.

Also\r\n      _Mânava‐Dharma Shâstra_, i. 30.\r\n\r\n  127 This has in Esotericism a direct bearing upon the seven “principles”\r\n      of the manifested Brahmâ, or Universe, in the same order as in man.\r\n      Exoterically, it is only four “principles.”\r\n\r\n  128 Wilson’s Translation, i. 81.\r\n\r\n  129 Demons is a very loose word to use, as it applies to a great number\r\n      of inferior—_i.e._, more material—Spirits, or minor Gods, who are so\r\n      termed because they “war” with the higher ones; but they are no\r\n      devils.\r\n\r\n  130 The same order of principles in man: Âtmâ (Spirit), Buddhi (Soul),\r\n      its vehicle, as Matter is the Vâhan of Spirit, and Manas (Mind), the\r\n      third, or the fifth microcosmically. On the _plane of personality_,\r\n      Manas is the first.\r\n\r\n  131 Thus, says the Commentary, the saying, “by day the Gods are most\r\n      powerful, and by night the Demons,” is purely allegorical.\r\n\r\n  132 This “thinking of oneself” as this, that, or the other, is the chief\r\n      factor in the production of every kind of psychic or even physical\r\n      phenomena. The words “whosoever shall say to this mountain be thou\r\n      removed and cast into the sea, and _shall not doubt_ ... that thing\r\n      will come to pass,” are no vain words. Only the word “faith” ought\r\n      to be translated by “Will.” Faith without Will is like a wind‐mill\r\n      without _wind_—barren of results.\r\n\r\n  133 The same idea is found in the first four chapters of _Genesis_, with\r\n      their “Lord” and “God,” which are the Elohim and the Androgynous\r\n      Eloha.\r\n\r\n  134 P. 398.\r\n\r\n  135 P. 107.\r\n\r\n  136 Spirits.\r\n\r\n  137 Also Spirits.\r\n\r\n  138 vi. 2‐6.\r\n\r\n  139 But see the difficulties suggested later, in the works of various\r\n      Geologists, against this theory. Compare Sir R. S. Ball’s articles\r\n      in _Nature_, xxv, 79‐82, 103‐107, Nov. 24 and Dec. 1, 1881.\r\n\r\n  140 The Rûpas.\r\n\r\n  141 The Goddess who gave birth to these primordial monsters, in the\r\n      account of Berosus, was Thalatth, in Greek Thalassa, the “Sea.”\r\n\r\n  142 See, for comparison, the account of creation by Berosus, as\r\n      preserved in Alexander Polyhistor, and the hideous beings born from\r\n      the two‐fold principle—Earth and Water—in the abyss of Primordial\r\n      Creation: Narâs (Centaurs, men with the limbs of horses and human\r\n      bodies), and Kinnaras (men with the heads of horses) created by\r\n      Brahmâ in the commencement of the Kalpa.\r\n\r\n  143 For a similar admission see Prof. Lefèvre’s _Philosophy_, 481.\r\n\r\n  144 xii. 10,308.\r\n\r\n  145 The Esoteric Doctrine says that this “Cosmic Evolution” refers only\r\n      to our Solar System; while exoteric Hindûism makes the figures\r\n      refer, if we do not mistake, to the whole Universal System.\r\n\r\n  146 Another point of disagreement. Occultism says that the astral\r\n      prototypes of the mineral, vegetable and animal kingdoms up to man\r\n      have taken that time (300 million years) to evolve, reforming out of\r\n      the cast‐off materials of the preceding Round, which, though very\r\n      dense and physical in their own cycle, are relatively ethereal as\r\n      compared with the materiality of our present middle Round. At the\r\n      expiration of these 300 million years, Nature, on the way to the\r\n      physical and material, down the arc of descent, begins with mankind\r\n      and works downwards, hardening or materializing forms as it\r\n      proceeds. Thus the fossils found in strata, to which an antiquity,\r\n      not of eighteen, but of many hundreds of millions of years, must be\r\n      ascribed, belong in reality to forms of the preceding Round, which,\r\n      while living, were far more ethereal than physical, _as we know the\r\n      physical_. That we perceive and disinter them as tangible forms, is\r\n      due to the process of materialization or crystallization referred\r\n      to, which took place subsequently, at the beginning of the Fourth\r\n      Round, and reached its maximum after the appearance of man,\r\n      proceeding parallel with his physical evolution. This alone\r\n      illustrates the fact that the degree of materiality of the Earth\r\n      changes _pari passu_ with that of its inhabitants. And thus man now\r\n      finds, as tangible fossils, what were once the (to his present\r\n      senses) ethereal forms of the lower kingdoms. The above Brâhmanical\r\n      figures refer to evolution beginning on Globe A, and in the First\r\n      Round. In this Volume we speak only of this, the Fourth Round.\r\n\r\n  147 This difference and the change of cyphers in the last three triplets\r\n      of figures, the writer cannot undertake to account for. According to\r\n      every calculation, once the three hundred millions are subtracted,\r\n      the figures ought to stand, 1,655,884,687. But they are given as\r\n      stated in the Tamil calendar above‐named and as they were\r\n      translated. The school of the late Pandit Dayânand Sarasvati,\r\n      founder of the Ârya Samâj, gives a date of 1,960,852,987. See the\r\n      _Ârya Magazine_ of Lahore, the cover of which bears the words:\r\n      “Âryan era 1,960,852,987.”\r\n\r\n  148 Vaivasvata Manu is the one Human Being—some versions add to him the\r\n      seven Rishis—who in the Matsya Avatâra allegory is saved from the\r\n      Deluge in a boat, like Noah in the Ark. Therefore, this Vaivasvata\r\n      Manvantara would be the “post‐diluvian” period. This, however, does\r\n      not refer to the later “Atlantean” or Noah’s Deluge, nor to the\r\n      Cosmic “Deluge” or Pralaya of obscuration, which preceded our Round,\r\n      but to the appearance of mankind in the latter Round. There is a\r\n      great difference made, however, between the Naimitika, Occasional or\r\n      Incidental, Prâkritika, Elemental, Atyantika, the Absolute, and\r\n      Nitya, the Perpetual Pralaya; the latter being described as\r\n      “Brahmâ’s contingent recoalescence of the Universe at the end of\r\n      Brahmâ’s Day.” The question was raised by a learned Brâhman\r\n      Theosophist: “Whether there is such a thing as Cosmic Pralaya;\r\n      because, otherwise, the Logos (Krishna) would have to be reborn, and\r\n      he is Aja (unborn).” We cannot see why. The Logos is said to be born\r\n      only metaphorically, as the Sun is born daily, or rather a beam of\r\n      that Sun is born in the morning and is said to die when it\r\n      disappears, whereas it is simply reäbsorbed into the parent essence.\r\n      Cosmic Pralaya is for things visible, not for the Arûpa, Formless,\r\n      World. The Cosmic or Universal Pralaya comes only at the end of one\r\n      hundred Years of Brahmâ, when the Universal Dissolution is said to\r\n      take place. Then the Avyaya, say the exoteric Scriptures, the\r\n      Eternal Life symbolized by Vishnu, assuming the character of Rudra,\r\n      the Destroyer, enters into the Seven Rays of the Sun and drinks up\r\n      all the waters of the Universe. “Thus fed, the seven Solar Rays\r\n      dilate to _seven suns_ and set fire to the whole Cosmos.”\r\n\r\n  149 Since a Mahâ Yuga is the 1,000th part of a Day of Brahmâ.\r\n\r\n  150 _Op. cit._, Art. “Geology.”\r\n\r\n  151 _Ibid._ This allows a chance even to the Biblical “Adam Chronology”\r\n      of 6,000 years.\r\n\r\n  152 _Modern Science and Modern Thought_, 48.\r\n\r\n  153 To the Silurian period as regards molluscs and animal life—granted;\r\n      but what do they know of man?\r\n\r\n  154 _Ibid._, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n  155 _Ibid._, 49.\r\n\r\n  156 Winchell, _World‐Life_, 180.\r\n\r\n  157 _Op. cit._, 49.\r\n\r\n  158 Wilson’s _Vishnu Purâna_, i. 51.\r\n\r\n  159 i. 32.\r\n\r\n  160 The atmosphere, or the air, the firmament.\r\n\r\n  161 _Harivamsha_, i. 36.\r\n\r\n  162 _Genesis_, i. 6‐9.\r\n\r\n  163 Lords.\r\n\r\n  164 They were told.\r\n\r\n  165 _i.e._, the Jivas or Monads.\r\n\r\n  166 Mother Earth or Nature.\r\n\r\n  167 For external bodies.\r\n\r\n  168 According to the wonderful chronology of Bentley, who wrote in days\r\n      when Biblical chronology was still undisputed; and also according to\r\n      that of those modern Orientalists who dwarf the Hindû dates as far\r\n      as they can.\r\n\r\n  169 Now Shrî is the daughter of Bhrigu, one of the Prajâpatis and\r\n      Rishis, the chief of the Bhrigus, the “Consumers,” the Aërial Class\r\n      of Gods. She is Lakshmî, the wife of Vishnu, and she is Gaurî, the\r\n      “bride of Shiva,” and she is Sarasvatî, the “watery,” the wife of\r\n      Brahmâ, because the three Gods and Goddesses are one, under three\r\n      aspects. Read the explanation by Parâshara, in _Vishnu Purâna_ (I.\r\n      viii., Wilson’s Trans., i. 119), and you will understand. “The lord\r\n      of Shrî is the moon,” he says, and “Shrî is the wife of Nârâyana,\r\n      the God of Gods”: Shrî or Lakshmî (Venus) is Indrânî, as she is\r\n      Sarasvatî, for in the words of Parâshara: “Harî [or Îshvara, the\r\n      ‘Lord’] is all that is called male [in the Universe]; Lakshmî is all\r\n      that is termed female. There is nothing else than they.” Hence she\r\n      is female, and “God” is male Nature.\r\n\r\n  170 Shrî is Goddess of, and herself “Fortune and Prosperity.”\r\n\r\n  171 _Masonic Review_ (Cincinnati), June, 1886.

All this has a deep philosophical meaning and\r\n      refers to the evolution and acquirement of divine powers through\r\n      _self‐exertion_. Some Rishi‐Yogîs are shown in the _Purânas_ to be\r\n      far more powerful than the Gods. Secondary Gods or temporary Powers\r\n      in Nature (the Forces) are doomed to disappear; it is only the\r\n      spiritual Potentiality in man which can lead him to become one with\r\n      the INFINITE and the ABSOLUTE.\r\n\r\n  176 The Triangle becomes a Pentagon (five‐fold) on Earth.\r\n\r\n  177 Seth, as Bunsen and others have shown, is not only the “primitive\r\n      God” of the Semites—early Jews included—but also their “semi‐divine\r\n      ancestor.” For, says Bunsen (_God in History_, i. 233, 234): “The\r\n      Seth of Genesis, the father of Enoch (the man) must be considered as\r\n      originally running parallel with that derived from the Elohim,\r\n      Adam’s father.” “According to Bunsen, the Deity (the God Seth) was\r\n      the _primitive god_ of Northern Egypt and Palestine,” says Staniland\r\n      Wake, in _The Great Pyramid_ (p. 61). And Seth became considered in\r\n      the later Theology of the Egyptians as an “evil demon,” says the\r\n      same Bunsen, for he is one with Typhon and one with the Hindû Demons\r\n      as a logical sequel.\r\n\r\n  178 _I Corinth._, xv. 47.\r\n\r\n  179 _Vâyu Purâna_; _Harivamsha_, 170.\r\n\r\n  180 See Mather’s _Kabbalah Unveiled_, p. 302.\r\n\r\n  181 Translated in Isaac Myer’s _Qabbalah_, p. 386.\r\n\r\n  182 _Zohar_ iii., 135a, 292a, _Idra Zootah_.

In relation to our\r\n      genealogical tree of man, the necessary conclusion follows that the\r\n      human race has _evolved gradually from the true apes_.” (_The\r\n      Pedigree of Man_, by Ernst Hæckel, translated by Ed.

The anatomical resemblances between Man and\r\n      the Anthropoids—grossly exaggerated as they are by Darwinists, as M.\r\n      de Quatrefages shows—are simply enough accounted for when the origin\r\n      of the latter is taken into consideration.\r\n\r\n      “Nowhere, in the older deposits, is an ape to be found that\r\n      approximates more closely to man, or a man that approximates more\r\n      closely to an ape.”\r\n\r\n      “The same gulf which is found to‐day between man and ape, goes back\r\n      with undiminished breadth and depth to the Tertiary period.

In _Mânava‐Dharma Shâstra_ they are called the _Lunar_\r\n      ancestors.”\r\n\r\n  210 See the “Laws of Manu”—_Mânava‐Dharma Shâstra_, iii. 203.\r\n\r\n  211 “Sacred Books of the East,” Vol. IV, _The Zend‐Avesta_, Pt. I.\r\n      lviii, Trans. by James Darmesteter.\r\n\r\n  212 Compare also what is said about Makara and the Kumâras in connection\r\n      with the Zodiac.\r\n\r\n  213 Whence the subsequent assertions of St. John’s vision, referred to\r\n      in his Apocalypse, about, “the great red dragon having seven heads\r\n      and _ten_ horns, and seven crowns upon his heads,” whose “tail drew\r\n      the _third part_ of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the\r\n      earth.” (Ch. xii.)\r\n\r\n  214 See _Harivamsha_, 932.\r\n\r\n  215 The verse “did cast them to the earth,” plainly shows its origin in\r\n      the grandest and oldest allegory of the Âryan Mystics, who, after\r\n      the destruction of the Atlantean _giants_ and _sorcerers_, concealed\r\n      the truth—_astronomical_, _physical_, and _divine_, as it is a page\r\n      out of _pre‐cosmic_ Theogony—under various allegories. Its true\r\n      Esoteric interpretation is a veritable Theodice of the “Fallen\r\n      Angels,” so called: the _willing_ and the _unwilling_, the\r\n      _creators_ and those who _refused to create_, being now mixed up\r\n      most perplexingly by Christian Catholics, who forget that their\r\n      highest Archangel, St. Michael, who is shown to conquer (to master\r\n      and to assimilate) the _Dragon of Wisdom_ and of divine Self‐\r\n      sacrifice—now miscalled and calumniated as Satan—_was the first to\r\n      refuse to create_! This has led to endless confusion. So little does\r\n      Christian Theology understand the paradoxical language of the East\r\n      and its symbolism, that it even explains, in its _dead‐letter\r\n      sense_, the Chinese Buddhist and Hindû exoteric rite of raising a\r\n      noise during certain eclipses to scare away the “great red dragon,”\r\n      which laid a plot to carry away the “light”! But here “light” means\r\n      Esoteric Wisdom, and we have sufficiently explained the secret\r\n      meaning of the terms Dragon, Serpent, etc., all of which refer to\r\n      Adepts and Initiates.\r\n\r\n  216 See _Genesis_ and Plato’s _Timæus_.\r\n\r\n  217 In spite of all efforts to the contrary, Christian Theology—having\r\n      burdened itself with the Hebrew Esoteric account of the creation of\r\n      man, which it understands _literally_—cannot find any reasonable\r\n      excuse for its “God, the Creator,” who produces a man devoid of mind\r\n      and sense; nor can it justify the punishment following an act, for\r\n      which Adam and Eve might plead _non compos_. For if the couple be\r\n      admitted to be ignorant of good and evil before the eating of the\r\n      forbidden fruit, how could it be expected to know that _disobedience\r\n      was evil_? If primeval man was meant to remain a half‐witted, or\r\n      rather witless, being, then his creation was aimless and even\r\n      _cruel_, if produced by an omnipotent and perfect God. But Adam and\r\n      Eve are shown, even in _Genesis_, to be created by a Class of lower\r\n      divine Beings, the Elohim, who are so jealous of their personal\r\n      prerogatives as reasonable and intelligent creatures, that they will\r\n      not allow man to become “as one of us.” This is plain, even from the\r\n      dead‐letter meaning of the _Bible_. The Gnostics, then, were right\r\n      in regarding the Jewish God as belonging to a Class of lower,\r\n      material and not very holy denizens of the invisible World.\r\n\r\n  218 In _Isis Unveiled_ several of these Gnostic systems are given. One\r\n      is taken from the _Codex Nazaræus_, the Scripture of the Nazarenes,\r\n      who, although they existed long before the days of Christ, and even\r\n      before the laws of Moses, were Gnostics, and many of them Initiates.\r\n      They held their “Mysteries of Life” in Nazara (ancient and modern\r\n      Nazareth), and their doctrines are a faithful echo of the teachings\r\n      of the Secret Doctrine—some of which we are now endeavouring to\r\n      explain.\r\n\r\n  219 i. 18.

His mother was Mâyâ. He himself was styled Akta\r\n      (_anointed_ χριστὸς) after the priest had poured upon his head the\r\n      spirituous (?) Soma, and on his body butter purified by sacrifice.”\r\n      (_Man before Metals_, p. 190.) The source of his information is not\r\n      given by the French Darwinist. But the lines are quoted to show that\r\n      light begins to dawn even upon the Materialists. Adalbert Kühn, in\r\n      his _Die Herabkunft des Feuers_, identifies the two signs [Symbol:\r\n      swastika] and [Symbol: swastika with dots around the center] with\r\n      Arani, and designates them under this name. He adds: “This process\r\n      of kindling fire naturally led men to the idea of sexual\r\n      reproduction,” etc. Why could not a more dignified idea, and one\r\n      more Occult, have led man to invent this symbol, in so far as it is\r\n      connected, in one of its aspects, with human reproduction? But its\r\n      chief symbolism refers to Cosmogony.\r\n\r\n      “Agni, in the condition of Akta, or anointed, is suggestive of\r\n      Christ,” remarks Prof. Jolly. “Mâyâ, Mary, His mother; Tvashtri, St.\r\n      Joseph, the carpenter of the Bible.” In the _Rig Veda_, Vishvakarman\r\n      is the highest and oldest of the Gods and their “Father.” He is the\r\n      “carpenter or builder,” because God is called even by the\r\n      Monotheists, the “Architect of the Universe.” Still, the original\r\n      idea is purely metaphysical, and had no connection with the later\r\n      Phallicism.\r\n\r\n  226 The real Manushya.\r\n\r\n  227 Barishad (?).\r\n\r\n  228 The Kavyavâhana, electric fire.\r\n\r\n  229 Shuchi, the spirit in the Sun.\r\n\r\n  230 The Pitris and the two Fires.\r\n\r\n  231 The form.\r\n\r\n  232 It is not clear why Bhûtas should be rendered by the Orientalists as\r\n      “evil spirits” in the _Purânas_.

In this case\r\n      these primitive men are the Doubles of the first ethereal Dhyânîs or\r\n      Pitris.\r\n\r\n  233 See _Pymander_, Everard’s Trans., II. 17‐29.\r\n\r\n  234 _Chaldean Account of Genesis_, p. 92.\r\n\r\n  235 P. 91.\r\n\r\n  236 _Ibid._, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n  237 _Ibid._, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n  238 Human Monad.\r\n\r\n  239 Astral shadow.\r\n\r\n  240 Kâma Rûpa.\r\n\r\n  241 Shuchi, the fire of passion and animal instinct.\r\n\r\n  242 Solar Fire.\r\n\r\n  243 Nascent Man.\r\n\r\n  244 Later.\r\n\r\n  245 Race.\r\n\r\n  246 See Shloka 22.\r\n\r\n  247 See _Genesis of the Elements_, by W.

If Science is\r\n      not entirely blinded by prejudice, it will see in this account a\r\n      profound knowledge of Natural Sciences and Physics, as well as of\r\n      Metaphysics and Psychology. But to find this out, one has to study\r\n      the personifications, and then convert them into chemical atoms. It\r\n      will then be found to satisfy both physical and even purely\r\n      materialistic Science, as well as those who see in evolution the\r\n      work of the “Great Unknown Cause” in its phenomenal and illusive\r\n      aspects.\r\n\r\n  249 _Sc._ Race.\r\n\r\n  250 Shlokas, 153, 154.\r\n\r\n  251 It is symbolized in the Pythagorean Triangle, the ten yods within,\r\n      and the seven points of the Triangle and the Square.\r\n\r\n  252 Whence the Kabalistic name of “Shells” given to the Astral Form, the\r\n      Body called Kâma Rûpa, left behind by the Higher Angels in the shape\r\n      of the Higher Manas, when the latter leaves for Devachan, forsaking\r\n      its residue.\r\n\r\n  253 Mackenzie’s _Royal Masonic Cyclopædia_, pp. 409‐411.\r\n\r\n  254 viii. 20.\r\n\r\n  255 _De Bell.

Not only are the animals created therein after the “Adam\r\n      of Dust,” but vegetation is shown _in_ the Earth before “the heavens\r\n      and the earth were created.” “Every plant of the field before it was\r\n      in the earth” (ii. 5). Now, unless the Occult interpretation is\r\n      accepted—which shows that in this Fourth Round the Globe was covered\r\n      with vegetation, and the First (Astral) Humanity was produced before\r\n      almost anything could grow and develop thereon—what can the dead\r\n      letter mean? Simply that the grass was in the earth of the Globe\r\n      before that Globe was created? And yet the meaning of verse 6, which\r\n      says that “there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the\r\n      whole face of the ground,” before it rained, and caused the trees,\r\n      etc., to grow, is plain enough. It shows also in what geological\r\n      period it occurred, and further what is meant by “heaven” and\r\n      “earth.” It meant the firmament and dry _incrustated_ land,\r\n      separated and ridden of its vapours and exhalations. Moreover, the\r\n      student must bear in mind that, as Adam Kadmon, the “male and female\r\n      being” of _Genesis_ i, is no physical human being but the host of\r\n      the Elohim, among which was Jehovah himself—so the animals,\r\n      mentioned in that chapter as “created” before man in the dead‐letter\r\n      text, were no animals, but the zodiacal signs and other sidereal\r\n      bodies.\r\n\r\n  260 _Book of Dzyan_, iii. 19.\r\n\r\n  261 Kenealy, _The Book of God_, pp. 114, 115.\r\n\r\n  262 To those who would enquire: What has Hydrogen to do with air or\r\n      oxygenation?—it is answered: Study first the ABC of Occult Alchemy.\r\n      In their anxiety, however, to identify Pymander, the “mouth of\r\n      mystery,” with St. John the Baptist prophetically, the Christian\r\n      Symbologists thus identified also the seven Kabiri and the Assyrian\r\n      Bulls with the Cherubs of the Jews and the Apostles. Having,\r\n      moreover, to draw a line of demarcation between the _four_ and the\r\n      _three_ the latter being the _Fallen_ Angels; and furthermore to\r\n      avoid connecting these with the “Seven Spirits of the Face,” the\r\n      Archangels, they unceremoniously threw out all they did not choose\r\n      to recognize. Hence the perversion in the order of the Elements, in\r\n      order to make them dovetail with the order of the Gospels, and to\r\n      identify the Angel‐Man with Christ. With the Chaldees, the\r\n      Egyptians—from whom Moses adopted the Chroub (Cherubs in their\r\n      animal form)—and the Ophites; with all these, the Angels, the\r\n      Planets, and the Elements, were symbolized mystically and\r\n      alchemically by the Lion (Mikael); the Bull (Uriel); the Dragon\r\n      (Raphael); the Eagle (Gabriel); the Bear (Thot‐Sabaoth); the Dog\r\n      (Era‐taoth); the Mule (Uriel or Thantabaoth). All these have a\r\n      qualificative meaning.\r\n\r\n  263 See _Hibbert Lectures_, 1887, pp. 370 _et seqq._\r\n\r\n  264 Sepher _M’bo Sha‐arim_, near the end, translated by Isaac Myer,\r\n      _Qabbalah_, p. 110.\r\n\r\n  265 Form.\r\n\r\n  266 Shadow.\r\n\r\n  267 S.

The\r\n      Sun, the immortal and powerful being that disappears every evening\r\n      from the horizon and descends under the Earth, as though he would\r\n      make room for the fraternal orb which comes to life with night, is\r\n      Pollux, who sacrifices himself for Castor; Castor, who, inferior to\r\n      his brother, owes to him his immortality; for the Moon, says\r\n      Theophrastus, is only another, but feebler Sun (_De Ventis_, 17).”\r\n\r\n  288 See _Book of Enoch_, Trans. by Bishop Laurence, 1883.\r\n\r\n  289 Adam (Kadmon) is, like Brahmâ and Mars, the symbol of the\r\n      _generative_ and _creative_ power typifying Water and Earth—an\r\n      Alchemical secret. “It takes Earth and Water to create a human\r\n      Soul,” said Moses. Mars is the Hindû Mangala, the planet Mars,\r\n      identical with Kârttikeya, the “War‐God”; he is Gharma‐ja, born of\r\n      Shiva’s _sweat_, and of the Earth. He is Lohita, the red, like\r\n      Brahmâ also and Adam. The Hindû Mars is, like Adam, born from no\r\n      woman and mother. With the Egyptians, Mars was the primeval\r\n      generative Principle, and so are Brahmâ, in exoteric teaching, and\r\n      Adam, in the Kabalah.\r\n\r\n  290 Abel is Chebel, meaning “pains of birth,” conception.\r\n\r\n  291 See _Isis Unveiled_, II. 398, where Jehovah is shown to be Adam and\r\n      Eve blended, and Hevah, and Abel, the _feminine serpent_.\r\n\r\n  292 See _Isis Unveiled_, I. 305: “The union of these two Races produced\r\n      a _third_ ...

I conclude that the sun has _no nucleus_, either\r\n      solid, liquid, or gaseous, but is composed of dissociated matter in\r\n      the critical state, surrounded, first, by  a flaming envelope, due\r\n      to the recombination of the dissociated matter, and outside of this,\r\n      by another envelope of vapours due to this combination.”\r\n\r\n      This is a novel theory to be added to other hypotheses, _all\r\n      scientific and orthodox_. The meaning of the “critical state” is\r\n      explained by Mr. W. Mattieu Williams in the same journal (Dec. 9,\r\n      1881), in an article on “Solids, liquids, and Gases.” Speaking of an\r\n      experiment by Dr. Andrews on carbonic acid, the Scientist says that:\r\n\r\n      “When 88° is reached, the boundary between liquid and gas vanishes;\r\n      liquid and gas have blended into one mysterious intermediate fluid;\r\n      an indefinite fluctuating something is there filling the whole of\r\n      the tube—an etherealized liquid or a visible gas. Hold a red‐hot\r\n      poker between your eye and the light; you will see an upflowing wave\r\n      of movement of what appears like liquid air. The appearance of the\r\n      hybrid fluid in the tube resembles this, but is sensibly denser, and\r\n      evidently stands between the liquid and gaseous states of matter, as\r\n      pitch or treacle stands between solid and liquid.”\r\n\r\n      The temperature at which this occurs has been named by Dr. Andrews\r\n      the “critical temperature”; here the gaseous and the liquid states\r\n      are “continuous,” and it is probable that all other substances\r\n      capable of existing in both states have their own particular\r\n      critical temperatures.\r\n\r\n      Speculating further upon this “critical” state, Mr. W. Mattieu\r\n      Williams emits some quite Occult theories about Jupiter and other\r\n      Planets. He says:\r\n\r\n      “Our notions of solids, liquids, and gases are derived from our\r\n      experiences of the state of matter here upon this Earth. Could we be\r\n      removed to another planet, they would be curiously changed. On\r\n      Mercury water would rank as one of the condensible gases; on Mars,\r\n      as a fusible solid; but what on Jupiter?\r\n\r\n      “Recent observations justify us in regarding this as a miniature\r\n      sun, with an external envelope of cloudy matter, apparently of\r\n      partially‐condensed water, but red‐hot, or probably still hotter\r\n      within. His vaporous atmosphere is evidently of enormous depth, and\r\n      the force of gravitation being on his visible outer surface two‐and‐\r\n      a‐half times greater than that on our earth’s surface, the\r\n      atmospheric pressure, in descending below this visible surface, must\r\n      soon reach that at which the vapour of water would be brought to its\r\n      critical condition. Therefore we may infer that the oceans of\r\n      Jupiter are neither of frozen, liquid, nor gaseous water, but are\r\n      oceans, or atmospheres of _critical_ water. If any fish or birds\r\n      swim or fly therein, they must be very _critically_ organized.”\r\n\r\n      As the whole mass of Jupiter is 300 times greater than that of the\r\n      Earth, and its compressing energy towards the centre proportional to\r\n      this, its materials, if similar to those of the Earth, and no\r\n      hotter, would be considerably more dense, and the whole planet would\r\n      have a higher specific gravity; but we know by the movement of its\r\n      satellites that, instead of this, its specific gravity is less than\r\n      a fourth of that of the Earth. This justifies the conclusion that it\r\n      is intensely hot; for even hydrogen, if cold, would become denser\r\n      than Jupiter under such pressure.\r\n\r\n      “As all elementary substances may exist as solids, liquids, or\r\n      gases, or, critically, according to the conditions of temperature\r\n      and pressure, I am justified in hypothetically concluding that\r\n      Jupiter is neither a solid, a liquid, nor a gaseous planet, but a\r\n      _critical_ planet, or an orb composed internally of associated\r\n      elements in the _critical_ state, and surrounded by a dense\r\n      atmosphere of their vapours and those of some of their compounds\r\n      such as water. The same reasoning applies to Saturn and other large\r\n      and rarefied planets.”\r\n\r\n      It is gratifying to see how “scientific imagination” approaches\r\n      every year more closely to the borderland of our Occult Teachings.\r\n\r\n  316 _The Day after Death_, p. 23.\r\n\r\n  317 Cremona Ed., iii. 76a; Brody Ed., iii. 159a; _Qabbalah_.

The Akkadians called him the “Lord of Ghosts”;\r\n      and he was the God of Nipur (Niffer) in northern Babylonia. It is\r\n      Mulil who caused the waters of the Flood to fall from Heaven on\r\n      Earth, because of which Xisuthrus would not allow him to approach\r\n      his altar. As the modern Assyriologists have now ascertained, it is\r\n      the northern Nipur which is the centre whence Chaldæan (Black) Magic\r\n      spread; and Eridu (the Southern) which was the primitive seat of the\r\n      worship of the culture God, the God of Divine Wisdom—the Sun‐God\r\n      being the Supreme Deity everywhere. With the Jews, the Moon is\r\n      connected with Israël’s Jehovah and his seed, for Ur was the chief\r\n      seat of the worship of the Moon‐God, and Abraham is said to have\r\n      come from Ur, when from A‐bra(h)m, he becomes Abraham.\r\n\r\n  322 When Nârada, the virgin‐ascetic, threatened to put an end to the\r\n      human race by preventing Daksha’s sons from procreating it.\r\n\r\n  323 x. 6.\r\n\r\n  324 This is corroborated by a learned Brahman. In his most excellent\r\n      Lectures on the _Bhagavad Gîtâ_ (_Theosophist_, April, 1887, p. 444)\r\n      the lecturer says:\r\n\r\n      “There is a peculiarity to which I must call your attention. He\r\n      [Krishna] speaks here of four Manus. Why does he speak of four? We\r\n      are now in the seventh Manvantara—that of Vaivasvata. If he is\r\n      speaking of the past Manus, he ought to speak of six, but he only\r\n      mentions four. In some commentaries an attempt has been made to\r\n      interpret this in a peculiar manner.\r\n\r\n      “The word ‘Chatvârah’ is separated from the word ‘Manavah,’ and is\r\n      made to refer to Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatkumâra, and Sanatsujâta,\r\n      who were also included among the mind‐born sons of Prajâpati.\r\n\r\n      “But this interpretation will lead to a most absurd conclusion, and\r\n      make the sentence contradict itself. The persons alluded to in the\r\n      text have a qualifying clause in the sentence. It is well known that\r\n      Sanaka and the other three refused to create, though the other sons\r\n      had consented to do so: therefore, in speaking of those persons from\r\n      whom humanity has sprung into existence, it would be absurd to\r\n      include these four also in the list. The passage must be interpreted\r\n      without splitting the compound into two nouns. The number of Manus\r\n      will then be four, and the statement would then contradict the\r\n      Paurânic account, though it would be in harmony with the Occult\r\n      theory. You will recollect that it is stated [in Occultism] that we\r\n      are now in the Fifth Root‐Race. Each Root‐Race is considered as the\r\n      Santati of a particular Manu. Now, the Fourth Race has passed, or,\r\n      in other words, there have been four past Manus.”\r\n\r\n  325 Stockwell, _Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge_, xviii.; R.

Hence arises the\r\n      seeming confusion and contradiction in the various _Purânas_, and at\r\n      times in the same _Purâna_, about the same individual. Vishnu—as the\r\n      many‐formed Brahmâ, and as Brahma (neuter)—is one, and yet he is\r\n      said to be all the twenty‐eight Vyâsas.\r\n\r\n      “In every Dvâpara (or third) age, Vishnu, in the person of Vyâsa,\r\n      divides the Veda, which is (properly, but) one, into many\r\n      portions.... Twenty‐eight times have the Vedas been arranged by the\r\n      great Rishis in the Vaivasvata Manvantara, in the Dvâpara age; and,\r\n      consequently, eight and twenty Vyâsas have passed away.” (_Vishnu\r\n      Purâna_, iii. 3; Wilson’s Trans., iii. 33, 34.) “[They who were all]\r\n      in the form of Veda‐Vyâsa; who were the Vyâsas of their respective\r\n      eras.” (_Ibid._, _loc. cit._, p. 33.) “This world is Brahmâ, in\r\n      Brahmâ, from Brahmâ ... nothing further to be known.” Then, again,\r\n      in the _Harivamsha_: “There were (in the first Manvantara) seven\r\n      celebrated sons of Vasishtha, who (in the _third_ Manvantara) were\r\n      sons of Brahmâ (_i.e._, Rishis), the illustrious progeny of Ûrjâ.”\r\n      (_Ibid._, iii. 6, note.) This is plain: the Humanity of the First\r\n      Manvantara is that of the seventh and of all the intermediate ones.\r\n      The Mankind of the First Root‐Race is the mankind of the Second,\r\n      Third, Fourth, Fifth, etc. To the last it forms a cyclic and\r\n      constant reïncarnation of the Monads belonging to the Dhyân Chohans\r\n      of our Planetary Chain.\r\n\r\n  347 The Dvâpara Yuga differs for each Race. All Races have their own\r\n      Cycles, which fact causes a great difference. For instance, the\r\n      Fourth Sub‐Race of the Atlanteans was in its Kali Yuga, when they\r\n      were destroyed, whereas the Fifth was in its Satya or Krita Yuga.\r\n      The Âryan Race is now in its Kali Yuga, and will continue to be in\r\n      it for 427,000 years longer, while various “Family Races,” called\r\n      the Semitic, Hamitic, etc., are in their own special cycles. The\r\n      forthcoming Sixth Sub‐Race—which may begin very soon—will be in its\r\n      Satya (Golden) Age while we reap the fruit of our iniquity in our\r\n      Kali Yuga.\r\n\r\n  348 See _Asiatic Researches_, viii. 280.\r\n\r\n  349 See Dowson’s _Hindû Classical Dictionary_, _sub voce_ “Idâ.”\r\n\r\n  350 See _Posthumous Humanity_: Translated by H. S. Olcott London, 1887.\r\n\r\n  351 Professor Newcomb says the heat evolved by contraction would last\r\n      only 18,000,000 years. (_Popular Astronomy_, 509.) While a\r\n      temperature permitting the existence of water could not be reached\r\n      earlier than 10,000,000 years ago. (Winchell’s _World‐Life_, 356.)\r\n      But Sir William Thomson says that the whole age of the incrustation\r\n      of the Earth is 80,000,000 years, though, this year, he has again\r\n      altered his opinion and allows only 15,000,000 years as the age of\r\n      the Sun. As will be shown in the Addenda, the divergence of\r\n      scientific opinions is so great that no reliance can ever be placed\r\n      upon _scientific_ speculation.\r\n\r\n  352 The essay on _The Plurality of Worlds_ (1853)—an anonymous work, yet\r\n      well known to have been the production of Dr. Whewell—is a good\r\n      proof of this. No Christian ought to believe in either the plurality\r\n      of Worlds or the geological age of the Globe, argues the author;\r\n      because, if it is asserted that this World is only one among the\r\n      many of its kind, which are all the work of God, as it is itself;\r\n      that all are the seat of life, all the realm and dwelling of\r\n      intelligent creatures endowed with will, subject to law and capable\r\n      of free‐will; then, it would be extravagant to think that _our_\r\n      World should have been the subject of God’s favours and His special\r\n      interference, of His communications and His _personal visit_. Can\r\n      the Earth presume to be considered the centre of the moral and\r\n      religious Universe, he asks, if it has not the slightest distinction\r\n      to rely upon in the physical Universe? Is it not as absurd to uphold\r\n      such an assertion (of the plurality of inhabited worlds), as it\r\n      would be to‐day to uphold the old hypothesis of Ptolemy, who placed\r\n      the Earth in the centre of our system? The above is quoted from\r\n      memory, yet _almost textually_. The author fails to see that he is\r\n      bursting his own soap‐bubble with such a defence.\r\n\r\n  353 _Man’s Place in Nature_, p. 58.\r\n\r\n  354 _De Cœlo_, II. 13.\r\n\r\n  355 Or what is more generally known as Protoplasm.

They are neither animals nor plants,\r\n      writes Hæckel; “the whole body of the Moneron represents nothing\r\n      more than a single thoroughly homogeneous particle of albumen in a\r\n      firmly adhesive condition.” (_Journal of Microscopical Science_,\r\n      Jan., 1869, p. 28.)\r\n\r\n  357 Behold the Iguanodon of the Mesozoic ages—the monster 100 feet\r\n      long—now transformed into the small Iguana lizard of South America.\r\n      Popular traditions about “giants” in days of old, and their mention\r\n      in every mythology, including that of the _Bible_, may some day be\r\n      shown to be founded on fact.

Since the\r\n      days of Hume, whose researches culminated in a nihilistic Idealism,\r\n      Psychology has gradually shifted its position to one of crass\r\n      Materialism. Hume is regarded as a Psychologist, and yet he denied\r\n      _à priori_ the possibility of phenomena in which millions now\r\n      believe, including many men of Science. The Hylo‐Idealists of to‐day\r\n      are rank Annihilationists. The schools of Spencer and Bain are\r\n      respectively positivist and materialist, and not metaphysical at\r\n      all. It is _Psychism_ and not Psychology; it reminds one as little\r\n      of the Vedântic teaching as does the pessimism of Schopenhauer and\r\n      von Hartmann recall the Esoteric Philosophy, the heart and soul of\r\n      _true_ Buddhism.\r\n\r\n  365 It must be noted that, though the astral and physical planes of\r\n      Matter ran parallel with one another even in the earliest geological\r\n      ages, yet they were not in the same phases of manifestation in which\r\n      they are _now_. The Earth did not reach its present _grade of\r\n      density_ till 18,000,000 years ago. Since then _both_ the physical\r\n      and astral planes have become grosser.\r\n\r\n  366 The conception and definition of the Absolute by Cardinal Cusa may\r\n      satisfy only the Western mind, prisoned, so unconsciously to itself,\r\n      and entirely degenerated, by long centuries of scholastic and\r\n      theological sophistry. But this “recent philosophy of the Absolute,”\r\n      traced by Sir William Hamilton to Cusa, would never satisfy the more\r\n      acutely metaphysical mind of the Hindû Vedântin.\r\n\r\n  367 Cudworth’s _Intellectual System_, I. 328.\r\n\r\n  368 Issued from the Body of Brahmâ when it became Night.\r\n\r\n  369 Intellectually vile.\r\n\r\n  370 Still senseless Race.\r\n\r\n  371 Race.\r\n\r\n  372 Intensified.\r\n\r\n  373 The vehicle of Desire.\r\n\r\n  374 Higher knowledge.\r\n\r\n  375 Monads.\r\n\r\n  376 Primitive human species.\r\n\r\n  377 _Inst.

The\r\n      Esoteric Doctrine risks the danger, nevertheless, and even goes so\r\n      far as to ask the impartial reader to compare the above hypothesis\r\n      (if it is one) with Hæckel’s theory—now fast becoming an axiom with\r\n      Science—which we quote verbatim as follows:\r\n\r\n      “How did life, the living world of organisms, arise? And, secondly,\r\n      the special question: How did the human race originate? The first of\r\n      these two enquiries, that as to the first appearance of living\r\n      beings, can only be decided empirically [!!] by proof of the so‐\r\n      called Archebiosis, or equivocal generation, or the spontaneous\r\n      production of organisms of the simplest conceivable kind. Such are\r\n      the Monera (Protogenes, Protamœba, Protomyxa, Vampyrella),\r\n      exceedingly simple microscopic masses of protoplasm without\r\n      structure or organization, which take in nutriment and _reproduce\r\n      themselves by division_. Such a Moneron as that primordial organism\r\n      _discovered_ by the renowned English zoologist Huxley and named\r\n      Bathybius Hæckelii, appears as a continuous thick protoplasmic\r\n      covering at the greatest depths of the ocean, between 3,000 and\r\n      30,000 feet. _It is true that the first appearance of such Monera\r\n      has not up to the present moment been actually observed_; but there\r\n      is nothing intrinsically improbable in such an Evolution.” (_The\r\n      Pedigree of Man_, Aveling’s translation, p. 33.)\r\n\r\n      The Bathybius protoplasm having recently turned out to be no organic\r\n      substance at all, there remains little to be said. Nor, after\r\n      reading this, does one need to consume further time in refuting the\r\n      further assertion that: “In that case man also has, _beyond a doubt_\r\n      [to the minds of Hæckel and his like], arisen from the lower\r\n      Mammalia, apes, the earlier simian creatures, the still earlier\r\n      Marsupialia, Amphibia, Pisces, by progressive transformations” (p.\r\n      36)—all produced by “a series of _natural forces working blindly,\r\n      ... without aim, without design_.”\r\n\r\n      The above‐quoted passage bears its criticism on its own face.\r\n      Science is made to teach that, which, up to the present time, “_has\r\n      never been actually observed_.” She is made to deny the phenomenon\r\n      of an _intelligent_ nature and a vital force independent of form and\r\n      matter, and to find it more scientific to teach the miraculous\r\n      performance of “natural forces _working blindly without aim or\r\n      design_.” If so, then we are led to think that the physico‐\r\n      mechanical forces of the brains of certain eminent Scientists are\r\n      leading them on as blindly to sacrifice logic and common sense on\r\n      the altar of mutual admiration. Why should the protoplasmic Moneron\r\n      producing the first living creature through _self‐division_ be held\r\n      as a very scientific hypothesis, and an ethereal pre‐human race\r\n      generating the primeval men in the same fashion be tabooed as\r\n      unscientific superstition? Or has Materialism obtained a sole\r\n      monopoly in Science?\r\n\r\n  383 The Râkshasas, regarded in Indian popular theology as Demons, are\r\n      called the “Preservers” beyond the Himâlayas. This double meaning\r\n      has its origin in a philosophical allegory, which is variously\r\n      rendered in the _Purânas_. It is stated that when Brahmâ created the\r\n      Demons, Yakshas (from _yaksh_, to eat) and the Râkshasas, both of\r\n      which kinds of Demons, as soon as born, wished to devour their\r\n      Creator, “those among them that called out ‘Not so: oh! let him be\r\n      saved [preserved]!’ were named Râkshasas.” (_Vishnu Purâna_, I. v.;\r\n      Wilson, i. 82.) The _Bhâgavata Purâna_ (III. 20, 19‐21; _ibid._,\r\n      _loc. cit._) renders the allegory differently. “Brahmâ transformed\r\n      himself into night [or ignorance] invested with a body.” This the\r\n      Yakshas and Râkshasas seized, exclaiming, “Do not spare it; devour\r\n      it.” Brahmâ cried out, “Do not devour me; spare me.” This has an\r\n      inner meaning of course. The “Body of Night” is the darkness of\r\n      ignorance, and it is the darkness of silence and secrecy. Now the\r\n      Râkshasas are shown in almost every case to be Yogîs, pious Sâdhus\r\n      and Initiates, a rather unusual occupation for Demons. The meaning\r\n      then is that while we have power to dispel the darkness of\r\n      ignorance—“devour it”—we have to preserve the sacred truth from\r\n      profanation. “Brahmâ is for the Brâhmans alone,” says that proud\r\n      caste. The moral of the _fable_ is evident.\r\n\r\n  384 The gradual evolution of man in the Secret Doctrine shows that all\r\n      the later (to the profane the earliest) Races have their _physical_\r\n      origin in the early Fourth Race. But it is the sub‐race, which\r\n      preceded the one that separated sexually, that is to be regarded as\r\n      the _spiritual_ ancestors of our present generations, and especially\r\n      of the Eastern Âryan Races. Weber’s idea that the Indo‐Germanic Race\r\n      preceded the Âryan Vedic Race is, to the Occultist, grotesque to the\r\n      last degree.\r\n\r\n  385 _Cf._ especially Schmidt’s _Doctrine of Descent and Darwinism_, pp.\r\n      39 _et seqq._, and Laing’s _A Modern Zoroastrian_, pp. 102‐111.\r\n\r\n  386 Every process of healing and cicatrization in the higher animal\r\n      groups—even in the case of reproduction of mutilated limbs with the\r\n      Amphibians—is effected by _fission_ and _gemmation_ of the\r\n      elementary morphological elements.\r\n\r\n  387 The term here means neither the dolicho‐cephalic nor the brachyo‐\r\n      cephalic, nor yet skulls of a smaller volume, but simply brains\r\n      devoid of intellect generally. The theory which would judge of the\r\n      intellectual capacity of a man according to his cranial capacity,\r\n      seems absurdly illogical to one who has studied the subject. The\r\n      skulls of the stone period, as well as those of African races\r\n      (Bushmen included) show that the first are above rather than below\r\n      the average of the brain capacity of the modern man, and the skulls\r\n      of the last are on the whole (as also in the case of Papuans and\r\n      Polynesians generally) larger by one cubic inch than that of the\r\n      average Frenchman. Again, the cranial capacity of the Parisian of\r\n      to‐day represents an average of 1437 cubic centimetres compared to\r\n      1523 of the Auvergnat.\r\n\r\n  388 A.

This is explained in the Section which\r\n      follows this series of Stanzas in the allegory from the _Purânas_\r\n      concerning Kandu, the holy sage, and Pramlochâ, the nymph who is\r\n      alleged to have hypnotized him; a suggestive allegory,\r\n      scientifically, as the drops of perspiration which she exuded, are\r\n      the symbols of the spores of Science.\r\n\r\n  393 This will be explained as we proceed. This unwillingness to fashion\r\n      men, or create, is symbolized in the _Purânas_ by Daksha’s dealings\r\n      with his opponent Nârada, the “strife‐making ascetic.”\r\n\r\n  394 Androgyne Third Race. The Evolutionist Professor Schmidt alludes to\r\n      “the fact of the separation of sexes, as to the derivation of which\r\n      from species _once hermaphrodite_ all [the believers in Creation\r\n      naturally excepted] are assuredly of one accord.” (_Doctrine of\r\n      Descent and Darwinism_, p. 159.) Such indeed is the incontestable\r\n      evidence drawn from the presence of rudimentary organs. Apart from\r\n      such palpable traces of a primeval hermaphroditism, the fact may be\r\n      noted that, as Laing writes, “a study of embryology ... shows that\r\n      in the _human higher animal_ species the distinction of sex is not\r\n      developed until a _considerable progress_ has been made in the\r\n      growth of the embryo.” (_A Modern Zoroastrian_, p. 106.) The Law of\r\n      Retardation—operative alike in the case of human races, animal\r\n      species, etc., when a higher type has once been evolved—still\r\n      preserves hermaphroditism as the reproductive method of the majority\r\n      of plants and many lower animals.\r\n\r\n  395 Vehicle.\r\n\r\n  396 _Vishnu Purâna_, I. vii; Wilson, i. 100.\r\n\r\n  397 See _Five Years of Theosophy_, p. 111.\r\n\r\n  398 For explanations and a philosophical account of the nature of those\r\n      Beings, which are now viewed as the “evil” and rebellious Spirits,\r\n      the Creators by Kriyâshakti, the reader is referred to the chapters\r\n      on “The Myth of the ‘Fallen Angel,’ in its Various Aspects,” in Part\r\n      II of this Volume.\r\n\r\n  399 _Vishnu Purâna_, III. ii.\r\n\r\n  400 In the oldest MS. of the _Vishnu Purâna_ in the possession of an\r\n      Initiate in Southern India, the God is not Indra, but Kâma, the God\r\n      of love and desire.\r\n\r\n  401 These are the exoteric figures given in a purposely reversed and\r\n      distorted way, being the figure of the duration of the cycle between\r\n      the First and Second human Race. All Orientalists to the contrary,\r\n      there is not a word in any of the _Purânas_ that has not a special\r\n      esoteric meaning.\r\n\r\n  402 _Vishnu Purâna_, I. xv; Wilson, ii. 5. Compare also Vivien’s\r\n      temptation of Merlin (Tennyson)—the same legend in Irish tradition.\r\n\r\n  403 x. 129.\r\n\r\n  404 The text has: “From Brahmâ, continuing to meditate, were born mind‐\r\n      engendered progeny, with forms and faculties derived from his\r\n      corporeal nature, _embodied spirits_, produced from the limbs\r\n      (Gâtra) of Dhîmat (all‐wise deity).” All these beings were the abode\r\n      of the three qualities of Devasarga, or divine creation, which, as\r\n      the five‐fold creation, is _devoid of clearness of perception,\r\n      without reflection_, dull of nature. “But as they _did not multiply\r\n      themselves_, Brahmâ created other mind‐born sons like himself,”\r\n      namely, the Brahmarshis, or the Prajâpatis, ten and seven in number.\r\n      “Sanandana and the other sons of Vedhas (Brahmâ) were previously\r\n      created,” but as shown elsewhere, they were “_without desire or\r\n      passion_, inspired with holy wisdom, estranged from the universe and\r\n      undesirous of progeny.” (_Vishnu Purâna_, X. vii; Wilson’s Trans.,\r\n      i. 100, 101.) These Sanandana and other Kumâras are then the Gods,\r\n      who after refusing to “create progeny” are forced to incarnate in\r\n      senseless men. The reader must pardon unavoidable repetitions in\r\n      view of the great number of facts given.\r\n\r\n  405 Compare Schlagintweit’s _Buddhism in Tibet_, pp. 88‐90.\r\n\r\n  406 See Edkins’ _Chinese Buddhism_, p. 208.\r\n\r\n  407 The previous Third Round.\r\n\r\n  408 Of this Round.\r\n\r\n  409 An allegorical reference to the “Sacred Animals” of the Zodiac and\r\n      other heavenly bodies. Some Kabalists see in them the prototypes of\r\n      the animals.\r\n\r\n  410 In _Hesiod_, Zeus creates his Third Race of men out of ash‐trees. In\r\n      the _Popol Vuh_ the Third Race of men is created out of the tree\r\n      Tzita and the marrow of the reed called Sibac. But Sibac means “egg”\r\n      in the mystery language of the Artufas, or Initiation caves. In a\r\n      report sent in 1812 to the Cortes by Don Baptista Pino it is said:\r\n      “All the Pueblos have their Artufas—so the natives call subterranean\r\n      rooms with only a single door where they (secretly) assemble....\r\n      These are impenetrable temples ... and the doors are always closed\r\n      to the Spaniards.... They adore the Sun and Moon ... fire and the\r\n      great _Snake_ (the creative power), whose eggs are called Sibac.”\r\n\r\n  411 There is a notable difference _esoterically_ between the words Sarpa\r\n      and Nâga, though they are both used indiscriminately. Sarpa,\r\n      serpent, is from the root _srip_, to creep, compare, Lat., _serp‐o_;\r\n      and they are called Ahi, from _hâ_, to abandon. The Sarpas were\r\n      produced from Brahmâ’s hair, which, owing to his fright at beholding\r\n      the Yakshas, whom he had created horrible to behold, fell off from\r\n      the head, each hair becoming a serpent. They are called “Sarpa from\r\n      their creeping and Ahi because they had deserted the head.” (Wilson,\r\n      i. 83.) But the Nâgas, in the allegories, their serpent’s tail\r\n      notwithstanding, do not creep, but manage to walk, run and fight.\r\n\r\n  412 Wilson translates the word as “demigods” (_Vishnu Purâna_, i. 130);\r\n      but Raumas are simply a race, a tribe.\r\n\r\n  413 xii. 10,308.\r\n\r\n  414 Wilson, _ibid._, p. 123.\r\n\r\n  415 _Ibid._, ii. 10.\r\n\r\n  416 Serpents.\r\n\r\n  417 Race.\r\n\r\n  418 Also.\r\n\r\n  419 Into male and female.\r\n\r\n  420 Then.\r\n\r\n  421 Man.\r\n\r\n  422 The “narrow‐headed.” Compare Shloka 24.\r\n\r\n  423 The “narrow‐headed.”\r\n\r\n  424 See Commentary on Shloka 36.\r\n\r\n  425 These “animals,” or monsters, are not the anthropoid or any other\r\n      apes, but verily what the Anthropologists might call the “missing\r\n      link,” the primitive lower man.\r\n\r\n  426 The shame of their animal origin which our modern Scientists would\r\n      emphasize if they could.\r\n\r\n  427 _The Doctrine of Descent and Darwinism_, pp. 186, 187. The “unknown\r\n      ancestry” referred to are the _primæval_ astral prototypes.\r\n\r\n  428 “A very strong argument in favour of variability is supplied by the\r\n      science of embryology. Is not a man in the uterus ... a simple cell,\r\n      a vegetable with three or four leaflets, a tadpole with branchiæ, a\r\n      mammal with a tail, lastly a primate [?] and a biped? It is scarcely\r\n      possible not to recognize in the embryonic evolution a rapid sketch,\r\n      a faithful summary, of the entire organic series.” (Lefèvre,\r\n      _Philosophy_, p. 484.)\r\n\r\n      The summary alluded to is, however, only that of the _store of\r\n      types_ hoarded up in man, the microcosm. This simple explanation\r\n      meets all such objections, as the presence of the rudimentary tail\r\n      in the fœtus—a fact triumphantly paraded by Hæckel and Darwin as\r\n      conclusively in favour of the Ape‐Ancestor Theory. It may also be\r\n      pointed out that _the presence of a vegetable with leaflets_ in the\r\n      embryonic stages is _not explained_ on ordinary evolutionist\r\n      principles. Darwinists have not traced man through the vegetable,\r\n      but Occultists have. _Why then this feature in the embryo_, and how\r\n      do the former explain it?\r\n\r\n  429 “The Proofs of Evolution,” a lecture by Hæckel.\r\n\r\n  430 Vol. i. pp. 388‐390.\r\n\r\n  431 See Cory, _Ancient Fragments_, pp. 21, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n  432 _Origin of Species_, pp. 448, 449, first edition.\r\n\r\n  433 Vol. i. p. 154.\r\n\r\n  434 The sin committed with the animals.\r\n\r\n  435 The Spirits, the “Sons of Wisdom.”\r\n\r\n  436 Who had refused to “create.”\r\n\r\n  437 Mindless.\r\n\r\n  438 Mind.\r\n\r\n  439 This verse in the _Rig Veda_ (x. 5, 6): “The Seven Wise Ones [Rays\r\n      of Wisdom, Dhyânis] fashion Seven Paths [or Lines, and also Races in\r\n      another sense]. To one of these may the distressed mortal come”—a\r\n      verse interpreted solely from the astronomical and cosmic aspect, is\r\n      one of the most pregnant in occult meaning. The “Paths” may mean\r\n      Lines (Maryâdâh), but they are primarily Beams of Light falling on\r\n      the Paths leading to Wisdom. (See _Rig Veda_, iv. 5‐13.) It means\r\n      “Ways” or Paths. They are, in short, the seven Rays which fall free\r\n      from the Macrocosmic Centre, the seven Principles in the\r\n      metaphysical, the seven Races in the physical sense. All depends\r\n      upon the key used.\r\n\r\n  440 _Rig Veda_, x. 10, 5, 2.\r\n\r\n  441 It is next to impossible to translate verbally some of these old\r\n      Commentaries. We are often obliged to give the meaning only, and\r\n      thus retranslate the verbatim translations.\r\n\r\n  442 Rudra, as a Kumâra, is Nîlalohita—red and blue.\r\n\r\n  443 This, regardless of modern materialistic evolution, which speculates\r\n      in this wise: “The primitive human form, whence as we think all\r\n      human species sprang, has perished this long time. [This we deny: it\r\n      has only decreased in size and changed in texture.] But many facts\r\n      point to the conclusion that it was hairy and dolichocephalic.\r\n      [African races are even _now_ dolichocephalic in a great measure,\r\n      but the palæolithic Neanderthal skull, the oldest we know of, is of\r\n      a large size, and no nearer to the capacity of the gorilla’s cranium\r\n      than that of any other now‐living man.] Let us, for the time being,\r\n      call this hypothetical species _homo primigenius_.... This first\r\n      species, or the ape‐man, the ancestor of all the others, _probably_\r\n      arose in the _tropical regions_ of the old world from _anthropoid\r\n      apes_.” Asked for proofs, the Evolutionist, not the least daunted,\r\n      replies: “Of these _no fossil remains are as yet known to us, but\r\n      they were probably akin to the Gorilla and Orang of the present\r\n      day_.” And then the Papuan negro is mentioned as the probable\r\n      descendant in the first line. (_Pedigree of Man_, p. 80.)\r\n\r\n      Hæckel holds fast to Lemuria, which, with East Africa and South Asia\r\n      also, he mentions as the possible cradle of the primitive ape‐men.\r\n      So also do many Geologists. Mr. A. R. Wallace admits its reality,\r\n      though in a rather modified sense, in his _Geographical Distribution\r\n      of Animals_. But let not Evolutionists speak so lightly of the\r\n      comparative size of the brains of man and the ape, for this is very\r\n      _unscientific_, especially when they pretend to see no difference\r\n      between the two, or very little at any rate. For Vogt himself showed\r\n      that, while the highest of the apes, the Gorilla, has a brain of\r\n      only 30 to 51 cubic inches, the brain of the lowest of the\r\n      Australian aborigines amounts to 99·35 cubic inches. The former is\r\n      thus “not half of the size of the brain of a new‐born babe,” says\r\n      Pfaff.\r\n\r\n  444 Ellis’ _Polynesian Researches_, Vol. II, p. 38. Missionaries seem to\r\n      have pounced upon this name _Ivi_ and made of it _Eve_. But, as\r\n      shown by Professor Max Müller, Eve is not the Hebrew name but a\r\n      European transformation of חוה, Châvah, life, or mother of all\r\n      living; “while the Tahitian _ivi_, and the Maori, _wheva_, meant\r\n      bone, and bone only.” (_Introduction to the Science of Religion_, p.\r\n      304.)\r\n\r\n  445 _Chaire d’Hébreu au Collége de France_, p. 20.\r\n\r\n  446 Of such semi‐animal creatures, the sole remnants known to Ethnology\r\n      were the Tasmanians, a _portion_ of the Australians and a mountain\r\n      tribe in China, the men and women of which are entirely covered with\r\n      hair. They were the last descendants in a _direct_ line of the semi‐\r\n      animal latter‐day Lemurians referred to. There are, however,\r\n      considerable numbers of the mixed Lemuro‐Atlantean peoples produced\r\n      by various crossings with such semi‐human stocks—_e.g._, the wild\r\n      men of Borneo, the Veddhas of Ceylon, classed by Prof. Flower among\r\n      Âryans (!), most of the remaining Australians, Bushmen, Negritos,\r\n      Andaman Islanders, etc.\r\n\r\n      The Australians of the Gulf of St. Vincent and the neighbourhood of\r\n      Adelaide are _very hairy_, and the brown down on the skin of boys of\r\n      five or six years of age assumes a _furry appearance_. They are,\r\n      however, degraded _men_; not the closest approximation to the\r\n      “pithecoid man,” as Hæckel so sweepingly affirms. Only a portion of\r\n      these men are a Lemurian relic. (_Cf._ _Esoteric Buddhism_, pp. 64\r\n      _et seqq._)\r\n\r\n  447 In calling the animal “soulless” we do not deprive the beast, from\r\n      the humblest to the highest species, of a Soul, but only of a\r\n      conscious surviving Ego‐Soul, _i.e._, that principle which survives\r\n      after a man, and reïncarnates in a like man. The animal has an\r\n      Astral Body, that survives the physical form for a short period;\r\n      nevertheless its (animal) Monad does not reïncarnate in the same,\r\n      but in a higher species, and has no “Devachan” of course. It has the\r\n      _seeds_ of all the human principles in itself, but they are\r\n      _latent_.\r\n\r\n  448 _Manual of Geology_, p. 302.\r\n\r\n  449 The “fables” and “myths” about Leda and Jupiter, and such like,\r\n      could never have sprung up in people’s fancy, had not the allegory\r\n      rested on a fact in Nature. Evolution, gradually transforming man\r\n      into a mammal, did in his case only what it did in that of other\r\n      animals. But this does not prevent man from having always stood at\r\n      the head of the animal world and other organic species, and from\r\n      having preceded the former.\r\n\r\n  450 See the Section on “The Chronology of the Brâhmans,” p. 69.\r\n\r\n  451 To avoid confusion, let the reader remember that the term Root‐Race\r\n      applies to one of the seven great Races, sub‐race to one of its\r\n      great Branches, and family‐race to one of the sub‐divisions, which\r\n      include nations and large tribes.\r\n\r\n  452 In the Section on “The Fifth Race and its Divine Instructors,” in\r\n      the Commentary on Stanza XII, the nature of these “Instructors” is\r\n      explained.\r\n\r\n  453 The present yellow races are the descendants, however, of the early\r\n      branches of the Fourth Race. Of the Third, the only _pure and\r\n      direct_ descendants are, as said above, a portion of the fallen and\r\n      degenerated Australians, whose far distant ancestors belonged to a\r\n      division of the seventh sub‐race of the Third. The rest are of mixed\r\n      Lemuro‐Atlantean descent. They have since then entirely changed in\r\n      stature and intellectual capacities.\r\n\r\n  454 _Language_ is certainly coëval with reason, and could never have\r\n      been developed before men became one with the informing principles\r\n      in them—those who fructified and awoke to life the mânasic element\r\n      dormant in primitive man. For, as Professor Max Müller tells us in\r\n      his _Science of Thought_: “Thought and language are identical.” To\r\n      add to this, however, the reflection that _thoughts which are too\r\n      deep for words, do not really exist at all_, is rather risky, for\r\n      thought impressed upon the astral tablets exists in eternity whether\r\n      expressed or not. _Logos_ is both reason and speech. But language,\r\n      proceeding in cycles, is not always adequate to express _spiritual_\r\n      thoughts. Moreover, in one sense, the Greek Logos is the equivalent\r\n      of the Sanskrit Vâch, “the immortal (intellectual) ray of spirit.”\r\n      And the fact that Vâch (as Devasenâ, an _aspect_ of Sarasvatî, the\r\n      Goddess of Hidden Wisdom) is the spouse of the eternal celibate\r\n      Kumâra, unveils a suggestive, though veiled, reference to the\r\n      Kumâras, those “who refused to create,” but who were compelled later\r\n      on to complete _divine_ Man by incarnating in him. All this will be\r\n      fully explained in the Sections that follow.\r\n\r\n  455 Ptolemy, speaking in his ninth table of the Kabolitæ or Kabul\r\n      tribes, calls them Ἀριστόφυλοι, Aristophyli, the aristocratic or\r\n      noble tribes. The Afghans call themselves Ben‐Issraël, children of\r\n      Is (sa) raël, from Issa, “woman and also earth,” sons of Mother\r\n      Earth. But if you call an Afghan Yahoudi (Jew), he will kill you.\r\n      The names of the supposed twelve tribes of the Jews, and the names\r\n      of the real twelve tribes of the Afghans, are the same. The Afghans\r\n      being far older (at any rate, their Arabic stock) than the\r\n      Israëlites, no one need be surprised to find such tribal names among\r\n      them as Youssoufzic, sons of Joseph, in Punjcaure and Boonere;\r\n      Zablistanee (Zebulon); Ben‐manasseh, sons of Manasseh, among the\r\n      Khojar Tartars; Isaguri, or Issachar, now Ashnagor in Afghanistan,\r\n      etc. The whole twelve names of the so‐called twelve tribes are names\r\n      of the signs of the Zodiac, as is now well proven. In any case, the\r\n      names of the oldest Arabic tribes, re‐transliterated, yield the\r\n      names of the zodiacal signs and likewise of the mythical sons of\r\n      Jacob. Where are the traces of the Jewish twelve tribes? Nowhere.\r\n      But there is a trace, and a deep one, that the Jews have tried to\r\n      deceive people with the help of these names. For, see what happens\r\n      ages after the _ten tribes_ had wholly disappeared from Babylon.\r\n      Ptolemy Philadelphus, desiring to have the Hebrew Law translated for\r\n      him into Greek (the famous Septuagint), wrote to the high priest of\r\n      the Jews, Eleazar, to send him _six men from each of the twelve\r\n      tribes_; and the _seventy‐two representatives_ (of whom sixty were\r\n      ghosts apparently) came to the king in Egypt and translated the Law\r\n      amid miracles and wonders. See Butler’s _Horæ Biblicæ_, Josephus,\r\n      and Philo Judæus.\r\n\r\n  456 The Commentary explains that the apes are the only species, among\r\n      the animals, which has gradually, and with every generation and\r\n      variety, tended more and more to return to the original type of its\r\n      male forefather—the dark gigantic Lemurian and Atlantean.\r\n\r\n  457 Androgyne.\r\n\r\n  458 Dr. A.

But, although Christian\r\n      Theology has always connected both Leviathan and Saraph Mehophep\r\n      with the Devil, the expressions are metaphorical and have nought to\r\n      do with the “Evil One.” Nevertheless, the word “Dragon” has now\r\n      become a synonym for the latter. In Bretagne the word Drouk now\r\n      signifies “Devil,” whence, as we are told by Cambry (_Monuments\r\n      Celtiques_, p. 299), the Devil’s Tomb in England, Droghedanum\r\n      Sepulcrum. In Languedoc the meteoric fires and will‐o’‐the‐wisps are\r\n      called Drac, and in Bretagne Dreag and Wraie or wraith; the castle\r\n      of Drogheda in Ireland meaning the Devil’s castle. (De Mirville,\r\n      _ibid._, ii. 423.)\r\n\r\n  468 The ultramontane writers accept the whole series of draconian\r\n      stories given by Father Kircher, in his _Œdipus Ægyptiacus_, “De\r\n      Genesi Draconum,” quite seriously. According to that Jesuit, he\r\n      himself saw a dragon which was killed in 1669 by a Roman peasant, as\r\n      the director of the Museo Barberini sent it to him, to take the\r\n      beast’s likeness, which Father Kircher did and had it published in\r\n      one of his _in‐folios_. After this he received a letter from\r\n      Christopher Scherer, Prefect of the Canton of Soleure, Switzerland,\r\n      in which that official certifies to his having seen himself, _with\r\n      his own eyes_, one fine summer night in 1619, a living dragon.\r\n      Having remained on his balcony “to contemplate the perfect purity of\r\n      the firmament,” he writes, “I saw a fiery, shining dragon rise from\r\n      one of the caves of Mount Pilatus and direct himself rapidly towards\r\n      Fluelen to the other end of the lake. Enormous in size, his tail was\r\n      still longer and his neck stretched out. His head and jaws were\r\n      those of a serpent. In flying, he emitted on his way numerous sparks\r\n      (? !).... I thought at first I was seeing a meteor, but soon,\r\n      looking more attentively, I was convinced by his flight and the\r\n      conformation of his body that I saw a _veritable dragon_. I am happy\r\n      to be thus able to enlighten your Reverence on the _very real_\r\n      existence of those animals”—in _dreams_, the writer ought to have\r\n      added, of long past ages. (_Ibid._, p. 424.)\r\n\r\n  469 As a convincing proof of the reality of the fact, a Roman Catholic\r\n      refers the reader to the picture of the incident painted by Simon de\r\n      Sienne, a friend of the poet, on the portal of the Church Notre Dame\r\n      du Don at Avignon, notwithstanding the prohibition of the Sovereign\r\n      Pontiff, who “would not allow this triumph of love to be enthroned\r\n      in the holy place”; and adds: “Time has injured the work of art, but\r\n      has not weakened its tradition.” (_Ibid._, p. 425.) De Mirville’s\r\n      “Dragon‐Devils” of our era seem to have no luck, as they disappear\r\n      most mysteriously from the museums where they are said to have been.\r\n      Thus the Dragon embalmed by Ulysses Aldovrandus and presented to the\r\n      Musée du Sénat, either in Naples or Bologna, “was there still in\r\n      1700,” but is there no more. (_Ibid._, p. 427.)\r\n\r\n  470 _Op. cit._, ii. 422.\r\n\r\n  471 _Ibid._, p. 433.\r\n\r\n  472 _Ibid._, pp. 432, 433. This is about as just as though, a few\r\n      millenniums hence, a fanatic of some future new creed, who was bent\r\n      upon glorifying _his_ religion at the expense of _ancient_\r\n      Christianity, were to say: Everywhere the quadruped lamb was adored.\r\n      The nun, calling it the Agnus, placed it on her bosom; the priest\r\n      laid it on the altar. It figured in every Paschal meal, and was\r\n      glorified loudly in every temple. And yet the Christians dreaded it\r\n      and hated it, for they slew and devoured it. Heathens, at any rate,\r\n      do not eat their sacred symbols. We know of no serpent or reptile‐\r\n      eaters, except in Christian civilized countries, where they begin\r\n      with frogs and eels, and must end with real snakes, as they have\r\n      begun with lamb and ended with horse‐flesh.\r\n\r\n  473 _Ibid._, p. 423.\r\n\r\n  474 _Pantheon_, 3.\r\n\r\n  475 The Solar Chnouphis, or Agathodæmon, is the Christos of the\r\n      Gnostics, as every scholar knows. He is intimately connected with\r\n      the Seven Sons of Sophia (Wisdom), the Seven Sons of Aditi,\r\n      Universal Wisdom, her eighth being Mârttânda, the Sun, which Seven\r\n      are the Seven Planetary Regents or Genii. Therefore Chnouphis was\r\n      the Spiritual Sun of Enlightenment, of Wisdom, hence the patron of\r\n      all the Egyptian Initiates, as Bel‐Merodach, or Bel‐Belitanus,\r\n      became later with the Chaldæans.\r\n\r\n  476 Hermes, or rather Thot, was a generic name. Abul Feda shows in his\r\n      _Historia Anti‐Islamitica_, five Hermes, and the names of Hermes,\r\n      Nebo, Thot were given respectively in various countries to great\r\n      Initiates. Thus Nebo, the son of Merodach and Zarpanitu, whom\r\n      Herodotus calls Zeus‐Belos, gave his name to all the great Prophets,\r\n      Seers and Initiates. They were all “Serpents of Wisdom,” as\r\n      connected with the Sun astronomically, and with Wisdom spiritually.\r\n\r\n  477 _Pantheon_, text 15.\r\n\r\n  478 i. 555.\r\n\r\n  479 _Genesis_, xlix. 17, 18, and 5, 6.\r\n\r\n  480 Dunlap, in his Introduction to _Sod, the Mysteries of Adoni_ (xi),\r\n      explains the word “Sod” as _arcanum_, religious mystery, on the\r\n      authority of Schindler’s _Penteglott_, 1201. “The secret of the Lord\r\n      is with them that fear him,” says _Psalm_, xxv. 14. This is a\r\n      mistranslation of the Christians, for it ought to read: “Sod Ihoh\r\n      (the Mysteries of Ihoh) are for _those who fear him_.” “Al [El] is\r\n      terrible in the great Sod of the Kedeshim (the Priests, the Holy,\r\n      the Initiated).”—_Psalm_, lxxxix. 7 (_ibid._). The Kedeshim were\r\n      very far from holy. See the Section on “The Holy of Holies,” in Part\r\n      II of this Volume.\r\n\r\n  481 “The members of the Priest‐Colleges were called Sodales,” says\r\n      Freund’s _Latin Lexicon_ (iv. 448). “Sodalities were constituted in\r\n      the Idæan Mysteries of the Mighty Mother,” writes Cicero in _De\r\n      Senectute_.

The horns, forming part of the shining aureole on\r\n      the statue of Moses in Rome by Michael Angelo, are vertical instead\r\n      of being bent down to the ears, but the emblem is the same; hence\r\n      the Brazen Serpent.\r\n\r\n  486 But see Harris’ _Magic Papyrus_, No. v, and the ram‐headed Ammon\r\n      manufacturing men on a potter’s wheel.\r\n\r\n  487 Brasseur de Bourbourg, _Mexique_, pp. 135 and 574.\r\n\r\n  488 Ulûpî (Ulûpl) has an entirely Atlantean ring about it. Like\r\n      Atlantis, it is neither a Greek nor a Sanskrit name, but reminds one\r\n      of Mexican names.\r\n\r\n  489 _Mahâbhârata_, Âdi Parva, Shlokas 7788, 7789. The _Bhâgavata Purâna_\r\n      (ix. xx. 31), as explained by Shrîdhara, the commentator, makes\r\n      Ulûpî the daughter of the king of Manipûra (see _Vishnu Purâna_,\r\n      Wilson, iv. 160); but the late Pandit Dayânand Sarasvatî, certainly\r\n      the greatest Sanskrit and Paurânic authority in India on such\r\n      questions, personally corroborated that Ulûpî was daughter of the\r\n      king of the Nâgas in Pâtâla, or America, 5,000 years ago, and that\r\n      the Nâgas were Initiates.\r\n\r\n  490 _Isis Unveiled_, ii. 293.\r\n\r\n  491 Foh‐tchou, in Chinese meaning literally Buddha’s lord, or the\r\n      teacher of the doctrines of Buddha—Foh.\r\n\r\n  492 This mountain is situated south‐west of China, almost between China\r\n      and Tibet.\r\n\r\n  493 _Ibid._, pp. 293, 294.\r\n\r\n  494 Let the reader be reminded that in the _Zohar_, and also in all the\r\n      Kabalistic works, it is maintained that “Metatron united with\r\n      Shekinah.” Now Shekinah as the Veil (Grace) of Ain Suph,\r\n      representing the Logos, is that very Tree of Knowledge; while\r\n      Shamaël—the dark _aspect_ of the Logos—occupies only the bark of\r\n      that tree, and has the knowledge of _evil_ alone. As Lacour, who saw\r\n      in the scene of the Fall (_Genesis_, iii) an incident pertaining to\r\n      Egyptian Initiation, says: “The Tree of the Divination, or of the\r\n      Knowledge of Good and Evil ... is the science of Tzyphon, the Genius\r\n      of Doubt, _tzy_ to teach, and _phon_, doubt. Tzyphon is one of the\r\n      Aleim; we shall see him presently under the name of Nach, the\r\n      tempter” (_Les Œloim_, vol. ii. p. 218). He is now known to\r\n      Symbologists under the name of Jehovah.\r\n\r\n  495 This is the view taken and adopted by all the Church Fathers, but it\r\n      is not the real Esoteric Teaching. The _curse_ did not begin with\r\n      the formation of either man or woman, for their separation was a\r\n      natural sequence of evolution, but with _the breaking of the law_.\r\n\r\n  496 By which _human_ nature lives; not even the animal—but the\r\n      misguided, sensual and vicious nature, which _men_, not Nature,\r\n      created.

In his work,\r\n      _Illustrations of the Rock‐Cut Temples of India_, he ventures to\r\n      express the very extraordinary opinion that “Egypt had ceased to be\r\n      a nation before the earliest of the cave‐temples of India was\r\n      excavated.” In short, he does not admit the existence of any cave‐\r\n      temple anterior to the reign of Ashoka, and seems anxious to prove\r\n      that most of these rock‐cut temples were executed during a period\r\n      extending from the time of that pious Buddhist king until the\r\n      destruction of the Andhra dynasty of Magadha, in the beginning of\r\n      the fifth century. We believe such a claim to be perfectly\r\n      arbitrary. Further discoveries will show that it is erroneous and\r\n      unwarranted.\r\n\r\n  511 America, at the time of its discovery, was called _Atlanta_ by some\r\n      native tribes.\r\n\r\n  512 Since then Donnelly’s _Atlantis_ has appeared, and soon its actual\r\n      existence will have become a scientific fact.\r\n\r\n  513 It is so divided to this day, and Theosophists and Occultists, who\r\n      have learned something of the occult but undeniable power of\r\n      Dugpaship at their own expense, know this but too well.\r\n\r\n  514 See De Mirville’s _Pneumatologie: Des Esprits_, iii. 57, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n  515 See Max Müller, _Chips_, i. 339; “Popol Vuh.” Compare also Holmberg,\r\n      _Ethnographische Skizzen über die Völker des Russischen Amerika_.\r\n      Helsingfors, 1855.\r\n\r\n  516 _Op. cit._, pp. 13‐15.\r\n\r\n  517 _Ibid._, p. 308.\r\n\r\n  518 An approach to the statues at Bamian—also a Buddha 200 feet high—is\r\n      found near a Jain settlement in Southern India, and appears to be\r\n      the only one that remains at present.\r\n\r\n  519 Even Wilson admits that Râma and Râvana were personages founded on\r\n      historical facts. “The traditions of the South of India uniformly\r\n      ascribe its civilization ... and the settlement of civilized Hindûs\r\n      [the Fifth Race] to the conquest of Lankâ by Râma” (_Vishnu Purâna_,\r\n      iii. 318)—the victory of the “Sons of Gods” over the Atlantean\r\n      sorcerers, says the _true_ tradition.\r\n\r\n  520 Thus we are shown one hero, to give an instance, first born as the\r\n      “unrighteous but valiant monarch” (Purusha) of the Daityas,\r\n      Hiranyakashipu, slain by the Avatâra Nara‐sinha (Man‐lion). Then he\r\n      was born as Râvana, the giant king of Lankâ, and killed by Râma;\r\n      after which he is reborn as Shishupâla, the son of Rajarshi (King\r\n      Rishi) Damaghosha, when he is again killed by Krishna, the last\r\n      incarnation of Vishnu. This parallel evolution of Vishnu (Spirit)\r\n      with a Daitya, as man, may seem meaningless, yet it gives us the key\r\n      not only to the respective dates of Râma and Krishna but even to a\r\n      certain psychological mystery.\r\n\r\n  521 Compare _Hibbert Lectures_, 1877, Sayce, pp. 134‐138.\r\n\r\n  522 The Gods became No‐Gods.\r\n\r\n  523 Race.\r\n\r\n  524 Yellow‐white.\r\n\r\n  525 Strictly speaking, it is only from the time of the Atlantean, brown\r\n      and yellow giant races, that one ought to speak of _man_, since it\r\n      was the Fourth Race only which was the first _completely human\r\n      species_, however much larger in size than we are now. In _Man:\r\n      Fragments of Forgotten History_ (by two Chelâs), all that is said of\r\n      the Atlanteans is quite correct. It is chiefly this Race which\r\n      became “black with sin,” that brought the divine names of the\r\n      Asuras, the Râkshasas and the Daityas, into disrepute, and passed\r\n      them on to posterity as the names of fiends. For, as said, the\r\n      Suras, Gods or Devas, having incarnated in the wise men of Atlantis,\r\n      the names of Asuras and Râkshasas were given to the ordinary\r\n      Atlanteans. Owing to the incessant conflicts of the latter with the\r\n      last remnants of the Third Race and the “Sons of Will and Yoga,”\r\n      their names have led to the later allegories about them in the\r\n      _Purânas_. “Asura was the generic appellation of all the Atlanteans\r\n      who were the enemies of the spiritual heroes of the Âryans (Gods).”\r\n      (_Man_, p. 77.)\r\n\r\n  526 In the beginning.\r\n\r\n  527 The sub‐races.\r\n\r\n  528 Their colours.\r\n\r\n  529 Stanza VII, Shloka 24.\r\n\r\n  530 See Shlokas 32, 34.\r\n\r\n  531 In general, the so‐called orthodox Christian conceptions about the\r\n      “fallen” Angels or Satan, are as remarkable as they are absurd.\r\n      About a dozen could be cited, of the most varied character as to\r\n      details, and all from the pens of educated lay authors, “university\r\n      graduates” of the present quarter of our century. Thus, the author\r\n      of _Earth’s Earliest Ages_, G. H. Pember, M.A., devotes a thick\r\n      volume to proving Theosophists, Spiritualists, Agnostics, Mystics,\r\n      metaphysicians, poets, and every contemporary author on Oriental\r\n      speculations, to be the devoted servants of the “Prince of the Air,”\r\n      and irretrievably damned. He describes Satan and his Antichrist in\r\n      this wise:\r\n\r\n      “Satan is the ‘Anointed Cherub’ of old.... God created Satan, the\r\n      fairest and wisest of all His creatures in this part of His\r\n      Universe, and made him Prince of the World, and of the Power of the\r\n      Air.... He was placed in an Eden, which was both far anterior to the\r\n      Eden of Genesis ... and of an altogether different and more\r\n      substantial character, resembling the New Jerusalem. Thus, Satan\r\n      being perfect in wisdom, and beauty, his vast empire is our earth,\r\n      if not the whole solar system.... Certainly no other angelic power\r\n      of greater or even equal dignity has been revealed to us. The\r\n      Archangel Michael himself is quoted by Jude as preserving towards\r\n      the Prince of Darkness _the respect due to a superior_, however\r\n      wicked he may be, until God has formally commanded his deposition.”\r\n      Then we are informed that “Satan was from the moment of his creation\r\n      surrounded by the _insignia of royalty_” (! !): that he “awoke to\r\n      consciousness to find the air filled with the rejoicing music of\r\n      those whom God had appointed.” Then the Devil “passes from the\r\n      royalty to his _priestly dignity_” (! ! !). “Satan was also a\r\n      _priest of the Most High_,” etc., etc. And now—“Antichrist will be\r\n      Satan incarnate.” (Chap. III and pp. 56‐59.) The pioneers of the\r\n      coming Apollyon have already appeared—they are the Theosophists, the\r\n      Occultists, the authors of the _Perfect Way_, of _Isis Unveiled_, of\r\n      the _Mystery of the Ages_, and even of the _Light of Asia_ ! ! The\r\n      author notes the “avowed origin” of Theosophy from the “descending\r\n      angels,” from the “Nephilim,” or the Angels of _Genesis_ (vi), and\r\n      the Giants. He ought to note his own descent from them also, as our\r\n      _Secret Doctrine_ endeavours to show—unless he refuses to belong to\r\n      the present humanity.\r\n\r\n  532 Compare x. 8, where it speaks of all who have come before Jesus,\r\n      being “thieves and robbers.”\r\n\r\n  533 Verse 14.\r\n\r\n  534 _Luke_, x. 18.\r\n\r\n  535 It is not correct to refer to Christ—as some Theosophists do—as\r\n      Buddhi, the sixth principle in man. The latter _per se_ is a passive\r\n      and latent principle, the Spiritual Vehicle of Âtmâ, inseparable\r\n      from the manifested Universal Soul. It is only in union and in\r\n      conjunction with _Self‐consciousness_ that Buddhi becomes the Higher\r\n      Self and the Divine, discriminating Soul. Christos is the seventh\r\n      principle, if anything.\r\n\r\n  536 xix. 7.\r\n\r\n  537 _Ibid._, verse 8.\r\n\r\n  538 xviii. 24.\r\n\r\n  539 To make it plainer, any one who reads the passage in _Luke_, will\r\n      see that the remark follows the report of the _seventy_, who rejoice\r\n      that “even the devils [the spirit of controversy and reasoning, or\r\n      the opposing power, since Satan means simply ‘adversary’ or\r\n      ‘opponent’] are subject unto us through thy name.” (_Luke_, x. 17.)\r\n      Now, “thy name” means the name of Christos, or Logos, or the Spirit\r\n      of true Divine Wisdom, as distinct from the spirit of intellectual\r\n      or mere materialistic reasoning—the Higher Self in short. And when\r\n      Jesus remarks on this that he has “beheld Satan as lightning fall\r\n      from heaven,” it is a mere statement of his clairvoyant powers,\r\n      notifying to them that he already knew it, and a reference to the\r\n      incarnation of the Divine Ray—the Gods or Angels—which _falls into\r\n      generation_. For not all men, by any means, benefit by that\r\n      incarnation, and with some the power remains latent and dead during\r\n      the whole life. Truly “no man knoweth who the Son is, but the\r\n      Father; and who the Father is, but the Son,” as added by Jesus then\r\n      and there (verse 22)—the “Church of Christ” less than any one else.\r\n      The Initiates alone understood the secret meaning of the terms\r\n      “Father” and “Son,” and knew that it referred to Spirit and Soul on\r\n      the Earth. For the teachings of Christ were Occult teachings, which\r\n      could only be explained at Initiation. They were never intended for\r\n      the masses, for Jesus forbade the twelve to go to the Gentiles and\r\n      the Samaritans (_Matth._, x. 5), and repeated to his disciples that\r\n      the “mystery of the kingdom of God” was for them alone, not for the\r\n      multitudes (_Mark_, iv. 11).\r\n\r\n  540 So, for instance, in the _Purânas_, Pulastya, a Prajâpati, or son of\r\n      Brahmâ—the progenitor of the Râkshasas, and the grandfather of\r\n      Râvana, the great king of Lankâ in the _Râmâyana_—had, in a _former\r\n      birth_, a son named Dattoli, “who is now known as the sage Agastya,”\r\n      says _Vishnu Purâna_ (Wilson’s Trans., i. 154). This name of Dattoli\r\n      alone, has six more variants to it, or seven meanings. He is called\r\n      respectively, Dattoli, Dattâli, Dattotti, Dattotri, Dattobhri,\r\n      Dambhobhi and Dambholi. These seven variants have each a secret\r\n      sense, and refer in the Esoteric Commentaries to various\r\n      ethnological classifications, and also to physiological and\r\n      anthropological mysteries of the primitive races. For, surely, the\r\n      Râkshasas are not Demons, but simply the primitive and ferocious\r\n      Giants, the Atlanteans, who were scattered on the face of the Globe,\r\n      as the Fifth Race is now. Vasishtha is a warrant of this, if his\r\n      words addressed to Parâshara, who attempted a bit of Jadoo\r\n      (sorcery), which he calls “sacrifice,” for the destruction of the\r\n      Râkshasas, mean anything. For he says: “Let no more of these\r\n      _unoffending_ ‘Spirits of Darkness’ be consumed.” (See for details,\r\n      _Mahâbhârata_, Âdi Parvan, s. 176; also _Linga Purâna_, Pûrvârdha,\r\n      s. 64; Wilson, _ibid._, i. 8, 9.)\r\n\r\n  541 We have a passage from a Master’s letter which has a direct bearing\r\n      upon these incarnating Angels. Says the letter: “Now there are, and\r\n      there must be, failures in the ethereal Races of the many Classes of\r\n      Dhyân Chohans, or Devas [_progressed entities_ of a _previous_\r\n      Planetary Period], as well as among men. But still, as the\r\n      _failures_ are too far progressed and spiritualized to be thrown\r\n      back forcibly from Dhyân‐Chohanship into the vortex of a new\r\n      primordial evolution through the lower Kingdoms, this then happens.\r\n      Where a new Solar System has to be evolved, these Dhyân Chohans are\r\n      borne in by influx ‘ahead’ of the Elementals [entities ... to be\r\n      developed into humanity at a _future_ time] and remain as a latent\r\n      or inactive spiritual force, in the Aura of a nascent World ...\r\n      until the stage of human evolution is reached.... Then they become\r\n      an _active force_ and commingle with the Elementals, to _develop\r\n      little by little the full type of humanity_.” That is to say, to\r\n      develop in man, and endow him with his Self‐conscious Mind, or\r\n      Manas.\r\n\r\n  542 Appendix XV, pp. 369, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n  543 When the Earth with its Planetary Chain and Man were to appear.\r\n\r\n  544 Our Earth and the physical plane of consciousness.\r\n\r\n  545 When the pure, celestial Beings or Dhyân Chohans, and the great\r\n      Pitris of various classes were commissioned—the one to evolve their\r\n      Images or Chhâyâs, and make of them physical man, the others to\r\n      inform and thus endow him with divine intelligence and the\r\n      comprehension of the Mysteries of Creation.\r\n\r\n  546 The “dynasties of kings” who all regard themselves as the\r\n      “anointed,” reigning by the “Grace of God,” whereas in truth, they\r\n      reign by the grace of Matter, the Great Illusion, the Deceiver.\r\n\r\n  547 _Ibid._, _loc. cit._, verse 10.\r\n\r\n  548 See the “Primeval Manus of Humanity.”\r\n\r\n  549 The “Heavenly Man,” please mark again the word, is the “Logos” or\r\n      the “Son” Esoterically. Therefore, once that the title was applied\r\n      to Christ, who was declared to be God and the very God himself,\r\n      Christian Theology had no choice. In order to support its dogma of a\r\n      personal Trinity it had to proclaim, as it still does, that the\r\n      Christian Logos is the only true one, and that all the Logoi of\r\n      other religions are false, and are only the masquerading Evil\r\n      Principle, Satan. See whereto this has led Western Theology!\r\n\r\n  550 “For the Mind, a deity abounding in both sexes, being Light and\r\n      Life, brought forth by its Word another Mind or Workman; which,\r\n      being God of the Fire and the Spirit, fashioned and formed seven\r\n      other Governors, which in their Circles contain the Phenomenal\r\n      World, and whose disposition is called Fate or Destiny.” (Sect. ix.\r\n      c. 1, ed. of 1579.)\r\n\r\n      Here it is evident that Mind, the Primeval Universal Divine Thought,\r\n      is neither the Unknown Unmanifested One, since it abounds in both\r\n      sexes—is male and female—nor yet the Christian “Father,” as the\r\n      latter is a male and not an androgyne. The fact is that the\r\n      “Father,” “Son,” and “Man” are hopelessly mixed up in the\r\n      translations of _Pymander_.\r\n\r\n  551 The allegory of the fire of Prometheus is another version of the\r\n      rebellion of the proud Lucifer, who was hurled down to the\r\n      “bottomless pit,” or simply on to our Earth, to live as man. The\r\n      Hindû Lucifer, the Mahâsura, is also said to have become envious of\r\n      the Creator’s resplendent Light, and, at the head of inferior Asuras\r\n      (not Gods, but Spirits), to have rebelled against Brahmâ; for which\r\n      Shiva hurled him down to Pâtâla. But, as philosophy goes hand in\r\n      hand with allegorical fiction in Hindû myths, the “Devil” is made to\r\n      repent, and is afforded the opportunity to progress: he is a sinful\r\n      man _esoterically_, and can by Yoga, devotion, and adeptship, reach\r\n      his status of “one with the deity,” once more. Hercules, the Sun‐\r\n      God, descends to Hades (the Cave of Initiation) to deliver the\r\n      victims from their tortures, etc. The Christian Church alone creates\r\n      _eternal_ torment for the Devil and the damned that she has\r\n      invented.\r\n\r\n  552 Why, for instance, should Éliphas Lévi, the very fearless and\r\n      outspoken Kabalist, have hesitated to divulge the mystery of the\r\n      Fallen Angels so‐called? That he knew the fact and the real meaning\r\n      of the allegory, both in its religious and mystical, as well as in\r\n      its physiological sense, is proved by his voluminous writings and\r\n      frequent allusions and hints. Yet Éliphas, after having alluded to\r\n      it a hundred times in his previous works, says in his later\r\n      _Histoire de la Magie_ (pp. 220, 221): “We protest with all our\r\n      might against the sovereignty and the ubiquity of Satan. We _pretend\r\n      neither to deny nor affirm here the tradition on the Fall of the\r\n      Angels_.... But if so ... then the prince of the Angelic Rebels can\r\n      be at best the last and the most powerless among the condemned—now\r\n      that he is separated from deity—which is the principle of every\r\n      power.” This is hazy and evasive enough; but see what Hargrave\r\n      Jennings writes in his weird, staccato‐like style:\r\n\r\n      “Both Saint Michael and Saint George are types. They are sainted\r\n      personages, or dignified heroes, or powers apotheosized. They are\r\n      each represented with their appropriate faculties and attributes.\r\n      These are reproduced and stand multiplied—distinguished by different\r\n      names in all the mythologies [including the Christian]. But the idea\r\n      regarding each is a general one. This idea and representative notion\r\n      is that of the all‐powerful champion—child‐like in his ‘virgin\r\n      innocence’—so powerful that this God‐filled innocence (the Seraphim\r\n      ‘know most,’ the Cherubim ‘love most’) can shatter the world\r\n      (articulated—so to use the word—in the magic of Lucifer, but\r\n      condemned), in opposition to the artful constructions, won out of\r\n      the permission of the Supreme—artful constructions (‘this side\r\n      life’)—of the magnificent apostate, the mighty rebel, but yet, at\r\n      the same time, the ‘Light‐bringer,’ the Lucifer—the ‘Morning Star,’\r\n      the ‘Son of the Morning’—the very highest title ‘out of heaven,’ for\r\n      in heaven it cannot be, but out of heaven it is everything. In an\r\n      apparently incredible side of his character—for let the reader\r\n      carefully remark that qualities are of no sex—this Archangel Saint\r\n      Michael is the invincible, sexless, celestial ‘Energy’—to dignify\r\n      him by his grand characteristics—the invincible ‘Virgin‐Combatant,’\r\n      clothed ... and at the same time armed, in the denying mail of the\r\n      Gnostic ‘refusal to create.’ This is another myth, a ‘myth within\r\n      myths,’ ... a stupendous ‘mystery of mysteries,’ because it is so\r\n      impossible and contradictory. Unexplainable as the Apocalypse.\r\n      Unrevealable as the ‘Revelation.’ ” (_Phallicism_, pp. 212, 213.)\r\n\r\n      Nevertheless, this _unexplainable_ and _unrevealable_ mystery will\r\n      now be explained and revealed by the doctrines of the East. Though,\r\n      of course, as the very erudite, but still more puzzling author of\r\n      _Phallicism_ gives it, no uninitiated mortal would ever understand\r\n      his real drift.\r\n\r\n  553 “Creation”—out of preëxistent eternal Substance, or Matter, of\r\n      course, which Substance, according to our teachings, is Boundless,\r\n      Ever‐existing Space.\r\n\r\n  554 The Luciferians, a sect of the fourth century who are alleged to\r\n      have taught that the soul was a _carnal_ body transmitted to the\r\n      child by its father, and the Lucianists, another and earlier sect of\r\n      the third century A.D., who taught all this, and further, that the\r\n      _animal_ soul was not immortal, philosophized on the grounds of the\r\n      real Kabalistic and Occult teachings.\r\n\r\n  555 This “Central Sun” of the Occultists even Science is obliged to\r\n      accept astronomically, for it cannot deny the presence in sidereal\r\n      space of a central body in the Milky Way, a point unseen and\r\n      mysterious, the ever‐hidden centre of attraction of our Sun and\r\n      System. But this “Sun” is viewed differently by the Occultists of\r\n      the East. While the Western and Jewish Kabalists—and even some pious\r\n      modern Astronomers—claim that in this Sun the God‐head is specially\r\n      present, referring to it the volitional acts of God—the Eastern\r\n      Initiates maintain that, as the Supra‐divine Essence of the Unknown\r\n      Absolute is equally in every domain and place, the “Central Sun” is\r\n      simply the centre of Universal Life‐Electricity; the reservoir\r\n      within which that Divine Radiance, already differentiated at the\r\n      beginning of every “creation,” is focussed. Though still in a Laya,\r\n      or neutral condition, it is, nevertheless, the one attracting, as\r\n      also the ever‐emitting, Life‐Centre.\r\n\r\n  556 _Op. cit._, pp. 287‐289.\r\n\r\n  557 See Commentary to Stanza VII, Volume I.\r\n\r\n  558 The _fourth_ and the _fifth_ from _below_ beginning with the\r\n      Physical Body; the _third_ and the _fourth_, if we reckon from Âtmâ.\r\n\r\n  559 _New Aspects of Life._\r\n\r\n  560 Angelic, Spiritual Essences, immortal in their Being, because\r\n      unconditioned in Eternity; but periodical and conditioned in their\r\n      Manvantaric manifestations.\r\n\r\n  561 _Op. cit._, pp. 97, 98, 2nd ed., 1887.\r\n\r\n  562 The history of Prometheus, Karma, and human consciousness, is to be\r\n      found in Part II, Section V.\r\n\r\n  563 By an Englishman whose erratic genius killed him. The son of a\r\n      Protestant clergyman, he became a Mohammedan; then a rabid Atheist;\r\n      after meeting with a Master, a Guru, he became a Mystic; then a\r\n      Theosophist who doubted, despaired—threw up _white_ for _black_\r\n      magic, went insane and joined the Roman Church. Then again turning\r\n      round, anathematized her, re‐became an Atheist, and died cursing\r\n      humanity, knowledge, and God, in whom he had ceased to believe.\r\n      Furnished with all the Esoteric data to write his “War in Heaven,”\r\n      he made a semi‐political article out of it, mixing Malthus with\r\n      Satan, and Darwin with the Astral Light. Peace be to his—_Shell_. He\r\n      is a warning to the Chelâs who fail. His forgotten tomb may now be\r\n      seen in the Mussulman burial ground of Joonaghur, Kathiawar, India.\r\n\r\n  564 The author talks of the _active, fighting_, damning Jehovah as\r\n      though he were a synonym of Parabrahman! We have quoted from this\r\n      article to show where it dissents from Theosophic teachings;\r\n      otherwise it would be quoted some day against us, as everything\r\n      published in the _Theosophist_ generally is.\r\n\r\n  565 _The Theosophist_, vol. iii. p. 68.\r\n\r\n  566 Explaining the _Kabalah_, Dr. Henry Pratt says: “Spirit was to man\r\n      [to the Jewish Rabbin, rather!] a bodiless, disembodied, or\r\n      deprived, and degraded being, and hence was termed by the ideograph\r\n      Nahash, ‘Deprived’; represented as appearing to and seducing the\r\n      human race—man through the woman.... In the picture from this\r\n      Nahash, this spirit was represented by a serpent, because from its\r\n      _destitution of bodily members_, the serpent was looked upon as a\r\n      deprived and depraved and degraded creature.” (_New Aspects of\r\n      Life_, p. 235.) Symbol for symbol there are those who would prefer\r\n      that of the serpent—the symbol of wisdom and eternity, deprived of\r\n      limbs as it is—to the Jod (י)—the poetical ideograph of Jehovah in\r\n      the _Kabalah_—the God of the male symbol of generation.\r\n\r\n  567 _Zohar_, iii. 61c.\r\n\r\n  568 Daksha, the “intelligent, the competent.” “This name generally\r\n      carries with it the idea of _creative power_.” He is a son of Brahmâ\r\n      and of Aditi, and agreeably to other versions, a self‐born power,\r\n      which, like Minerva, sprang from his father’s body. He is the chief\r\n      of the Prajâpatis, the Lords or Creators of Being. In _Vishnu\r\n      Purâna_, Parâshara says of him: “In every Kalpa [or Manvantara]\r\n      Daksha and the rest are born and are again destroyed.” And the _Rig\r\n      Veda_ says that “Daksha sprang from Aditi and Aditi from Daksha,” a\r\n      reference to the eternal cyclic re‐birth of the same divine Essence.\r\n\r\n  569 _Bhâgavata Purâna_, iv. 24, 4.\r\n\r\n  570 No one of these Orders is distinct from the Pitris or Progenitors.\r\n      As says Manu (iii. 284): “The wise call our fathers Vasus; our\r\n      paternal grandfathers, Rudras; our paternal great grandfathers,\r\n      Âdityas; agreeably to a text of the Vedas.” “This is an everlasting\r\n      Vedic text,” says another translation.\r\n\r\n  571 As now discovered by the late G. Smith in the Babylonian cylinder\r\n      literature, it was the same in Chaldæan Theogony. Ishtar, “eldest of\r\n      Heaven and of Earth.” Below him the Igigi or Angels of Heaven, and\r\n      the Anûnaki, or Angels of Earth. Below these again various classes\r\n      of Spirits and “Genii” called Sadu, Vadukku, Ekimu, Gallu—of which\r\n      some were good, some evil. (See Smith’s _Babylonian Mythology_, also\r\n      Sayce’s _Hibbert Lectures_, p. 141.)\r\n\r\n  572 Some superior, others inferior, _to suit the Karma_ of the various\r\n      reïncarnating Monads, which could not all be of the same degree of\r\n      purity in their last births in other Worlds. This accounts for the\r\n      difference of races, the inferiority of the savage and other human\r\n      varieties.\r\n\r\n  573 “There are,” says Topinard in the English edition of his\r\n      _Anthropology_, with a preface by Professor Broca, “_three_\r\n      fundamental elements of colour in the human organism—namely, the\r\n      _red_, the _yellow_, and the _black_, which, mixed in variable\r\n      quantities with the white of the tissues, give rise to those\r\n      numerous shades seen in the human family.” Here is Science again\r\n      unintentionally supporting Occultism.\r\n\r\n  574 It must be remembered that the “last remnants” here spoken of, refer\r\n      to those portions of the “Great Continent” which still remained, and\r\n      not to any of the numerous islands which existed contemporaneously\r\n      with the Continent. Plato’s “island,” for instance, was one of such\r\n      remnants; the others having sunk at various periods previously. An\r\n      Occult “tradition” teaches that such submersions occur whenever\r\n      there is an eclipse of the “Spiritual Sun.”\r\n\r\n  575 See the remarks on the Root and Seed Manus _infra_, and the Section\r\n      on “The Primeval Manus of Humanity,” at the end of the Commentaries\r\n      on this Stanza.\r\n\r\n  576 Mr. Gladstone’s unfortunate attempt to reconcile the Genetic account\r\n      with Science (see his “Dawn of Creation” and “Proem to Genesis,” in\r\n      _The Nineteenth Century_, 1886), has brought upon him the Jovian\r\n      thunderbolt hurled by Mr. Huxley. The dead‐letter account warranted\r\n      no such attempt; and his fourfold order, or division, of animated\r\n      creation, has turned into the stone which, instead of killing the\r\n      fly on the sleeping friend’s brow, killed the man himself. Mr.\r\n      Gladstone has killed _Genesis_ for ever. But this does not prove\r\n      that there is no Esotericism in the latter. The fact that the Jews\r\n      and all the Christians, the modern as well as the early sects, have\r\n      accepted the narrative _literally_ for two thousand years, proves\r\n      only their ignorance, and shows the great ingenuity and constructive\r\n      ability of the Initiated Rabbis, who built the two accounts—the\r\n      Elohistic and Jehovistic—Esoterically, and purposely confused the\r\n      meaning by the vowelless glyphs or word‐signs in the original text.\r\n      The six days (Yom) of creation do mean six periods of evolution, and\r\n      the seventh day is that of culmination, of perfection—not of rest.\r\n      These refer to the seven Rounds and the seven Races with a distinct\r\n      “creation” in each; though the use of the words Boker, “dawn” or\r\n      “morning,” and Ereb, “evening twilight”—which have Esoterically the\r\n      same meaning as Sandhyâ, “twilight,” in Sanskrit—have led to a\r\n      charge of the most crass ignorance of the order of evolution.\r\n\r\n  577 _Modern Science and Modern Thought_, p. 337.\r\n\r\n  578 Dowson’s _Hindû Classical Dictionary_, _sub voce_.\r\n\r\n  579 _Op. cit._, p. 335.\r\n\r\n  580 “Follow the law of analogy”—the Masters teach. Âtmâ‐Buddhi is dual\r\n      and Manas is triple, inasmuch as the former has two aspects, and the\r\n      latter three, _i.e._, as a “principle” _per se_, which gravitates,\r\n      in its higher aspect, to Âtmâ‐Buddhi, and follows, in its lower\r\n      nature, Kâma, the seat of terrestrial and animal desires and\r\n      passions. Now compare the evolution of the Races, the First and the\r\n      Second of which are of the nature of Âtmâ‐Buddhi, of which they are\r\n      the passive Spiritual progeny, while the Third Root‐Race shows three\r\n      distinct divisions or aspects physiologically and psychically—the\r\n      earliest sinless, the middle portions awakening to intelligence, and\r\n      the third and last decidedly _animal_, _i.e._, Manas succumbs to the\r\n      temptations of Kâma.\r\n\r\n  581 Laing, _op. cit._, _ibid._\r\n\r\n  582 The whole trouble is this: neither Physiologists nor Pathologists\r\n      will recognize that the cell‐germinating substance, the\r\n      Cytoblastema, and the mother‐lye from which crystals originate, are\r\n      one and the same essence, save in differentiation for certain\r\n      purposes.\r\n\r\n  583 Huxley, _Proceedings of the Royal Institution_, iii. 151.\r\n\r\n  584 _Introduction to the Study of the Foraminifera_, p. xi.\r\n\r\n  585 _Transactions of the Geological Society of Glasgow_, vol. iii.

The order of the seven classes, or orders\r\n      of plants, animals, and even inanimate things, given at random in\r\n      the _Purânas_, is found in several commentaries in the correct\r\n      rotation. Thus, Prithu is the father of the Earth. He “milks” her,\r\n      and makes her bear every kind of grain and vegetable, all enumerated\r\n      and specified. Kashyapa is the “father” of all the reptiles, snakes,\r\n      demons, etc.\r\n\r\n  590 See vol. i. pp. 151, _et seqq._, concerning the “Tree of\r\n      Evolution”—the “Mundane Tree.”\r\n\r\n  591 Checked and modified, however, by the Law of Retardation, which\r\n      imposes a restriction on the advance of all species when a _higher\r\n      type_ makes its appearance.\r\n\r\n  592 See _Origin of Species_, p. 145.\r\n\r\n  593 Bastian, _Beginnings of Life_, ii. pp. 622, 623.\r\n\r\n  594 Vol. ii. p. 278.\r\n\r\n  595 _Op. cit._, i. 9.\r\n\r\n  596 _Ibid._, ii. 283, 284.\r\n\r\n  597 See his _Lettres sur l’Atlantide_.\r\n\r\n  598 This is shown by Faber, again a pious Christian, who says that: “The\r\n      Noëtic family also ... bore the appellations of Atlanteans and\r\n      Titans; and the great patriarch himself was called, by way of\r\n      eminence, Atlas and Titan.” (_Ibid._, ii. 285.) And if so, then,\r\n      _according to the Bible_, Noah must have been the progeny of the\r\n      Sons of God, the Fallen Angels, agreeably to the same authority, and\r\n      of the “daughters of men who were fair.” (See _Genesis_, vi.) And\r\n      why not, since his father Lamech slew a man, and was, with all his\r\n      sons and daughters, who perished in the Deluge, as bad as the rest\r\n      of mankind?\r\n\r\n  599 In that wonderful volume of Donnelly, _Atlantis, the Antediluvian\r\n      World_, the author, speaking of the Âryan colonies from Atlantis,\r\n      and of the arts and sciences—the legacy of our Fourth Race—bravely\r\n      announces that “the roots of the institutions of to‐day reach back\r\n      to the Miocene age.” This is an enormous allowance for a modern\r\n      scholar to make; but civilization dates still further back than the\r\n      Miocene Atlanteans. Secondary‐period man will be discovered, and\r\n      with him his long forgotten civilization.\r\n\r\n  600 Nature is the _Natural_ Body, the Shadow of the Progenitors.\r\n\r\n  601 Man is the “Heavenly Man,” as already stated.\r\n\r\n  602 _Divine Pymander_, i. 16.\r\n\r\n  603 The _Pymander_ of our museums and libraries is an abridgment of one\r\n      of the Books of Thoth, by a Platonist of Alexandria. In the Third\r\n      Century it was remodelled after old Hebrew and Phœnician MSS. by a\r\n      Jewish Kabalist, and called the _Genesis of Enoch_. But even its\r\n      disfigured remnants show how closely its text agrees with the\r\n      Archaic Doctrine, as is shown in the creation of the Seven Creators\r\n      and Seven Primitive Men. As to Enoch, Thoth or Hermes, Orpheus and\r\n      Cadmus, these are all generic names, branches and offshoots of the\r\n      seven primordial Sages—incarnated Dhyân Chohans or Devas, in\r\n      _illusive_, not mortal bodies—who taught Humanity all it knew, and\r\n      whose earliest disciples assumed their Master’s names. This custom\r\n      passed from the Fourth to the Fifth Race. Hence the sameness of the\r\n      traditions about Hermes—of whom Egyptologists count five—Enoch,\r\n      etc.; they are all inventors of letters; none of them die; they\r\n      still live, and are the first Initiators into, and Founders of, the\r\n      Mysteries. It was only very lately that the _Genesis of Enoch_\r\n      disappeared from among the Kabalists. Guillaume Postel saw it. It\r\n      was most certainly in a great measure a transcript from the Books of\r\n      Hermes, and far anterior to the Books of Moses, as Éliphas Lévi\r\n      tells his readers.\r\n\r\n  604 Uranus is a modified Varuna, the “universal encompasser,” the “all‐\r\n      embracer,” and one of the oldest of the Vedic Deities—Space, the\r\n      maker of Heaven and Earth, since both are manifested out of his (or\r\n      its) seed. It is only later that Varuna became the chief of the\r\n      Âdityas and a kind of Neptune riding on the “Leviathan”—Makara, now\r\n      the most sacred and mysterious of the Signs of the Zodiac. Varuna,\r\n      without whom “no creature can even wink,” was degraded like Uranus,\r\n      and, like him, _fell into generation_; his functions—“the grandest\r\n      cosmical functions,” as Muir calls them—having been degraded from\r\n      Heaven to Earth by exoteric anthropomorphism. As the same\r\n      Orientalist says: “The attributes and functions ascribed to Varuna\r\n      [in the Vedas] impart to his character a moral elevation and\r\n      sanctity far surpassing that attributed to any other Vedic Deity.”\r\n      But to understand correctly the reason of his fall, like as that of\r\n      Uranus, one has to see in every exoteric religion the imperfect and\r\n      sinful work of man’s fancy, and also to study the mysteries which\r\n      Varuna is said to have imparted to Vasishtha. Only “his secrets and\r\n      those of Mitra _are not to be revealed to the foolish_.”\r\n\r\n  605 _Mythologie de la Grèce Antique_, p. 7.\r\n\r\n  606 Cronus is not only Χρόνος, Time, but also, as Bréal showed, in his\r\n      _Hercule et Cacus_ (p. 57), comes from the root _kar_, “to make, to\r\n      create.” Whether Bréal and Decharme, who quotes him, are as right in\r\n      saying that in the _Vedas_, Krânan (_sic_) is a Creative God, we\r\n      have our doubts. Bréal probably meant Karma, or rather Visvakarman,\r\n      the Creative God, the “omnificent” and the “great architect of the\r\n      world.”\r\n\r\n  607 See Stanzas III—X, _et seqq._, and also Berosus’ account of primeval\r\n      creation.\r\n\r\n  608 The Titanic struggle, in Theogony at least, is the fight for\r\n      supremacy between the children of Uranus and Gæa (or Heaven and\r\n      Earth in their abstract sense), the Titans, against the children of\r\n      Cronus, whose chief is Zeus. It is the everlasting struggle going on\r\n      to this day between the Spiritual Inner Man and the man of flesh, in\r\n      one sense.\r\n\r\n  609 Just as the “Lord God,” or Jehovah, is Cain, esoterically, and the\r\n      “tempting serpent” as well; the male portion of the androgynous\r\n      Eve—before her “Fall,” the female portion of Adam Kadmon—the left\r\n      side, or Binah, of the right side, Chokmah, in the first Sephirothal\r\n      Triad.\r\n\r\n  610 Decharme, _op. cit._, p. 284.\r\n\r\n  611 In the Egyptian legend, called the “Two Brothers,” translated by M.\r\n      Maspéro (the ex‐director of the Boulaq Museum), the original of\r\n      Pandora is given. Noom, the famous heavenly artist, creates a\r\n      marvellous beauty, a girl whom he sends to Batoo, after which the\r\n      happiness of the latter is destroyed. Batoo is man, and the girl\r\n      Eve, of course. (See _Revue Archéologique_, March, 1878, and also\r\n      Decharme, _ibid._, p. 285.)\r\n\r\n  612 Yima is not the “first man” in the _Vendîdâd_, but only in the\r\n      theories of the Orientalists.\r\n\r\n  613 Bœotia was submerged and subsequently ancient Athens and Eleusis.\r\n\r\n  614 _Opera et Dies_, v. 108.\r\n\r\n  615 _Nem._, VI. i.\r\n\r\n  616 See _Apollod._, i. 7, 2; and Ovid, _Metam._, i. 260, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n  617 _Deutsche Mythol._, i. 545, 3rd edit., and Hanusch _Schlawische\r\n      Myth._, p. 235.

All of them were not bad, but became\r\n      so towards the end of their cycle, as we, the Fifth Race, are now\r\n      fast becoming.\r\n\r\n  625 The “Gods of the Elements” are by no means the Elementals. The\r\n      latter are at best used by them as vehicles and materials in which\r\n      to clothe themselves.\r\n\r\n  626 Cain was the “sacrificer,” as shown at first in Chap. iv. of\r\n      _Genesis_, of “the fruit of the ground,” of which he was the _first\r\n      tiller_, while Abel “brought of the firstlings of his flock” to the\r\n      Lord. Cain is the symbol of the first male, Abel of the first female\r\n      humanity, Adam and Eve being the types of the Third Race. The\r\n      “murdering” is blood‐shedding, but not taking life.\r\n\r\n  627 _Genesis_, vi.\r\n\r\n  628 It is, perhaps, with an eye to this _degradation_ of the highest and\r\n      purest Spirits, who broke through the intermediate planes of lower\r\n      consciousness, the “Seven Circles of Fire” of _Pymander_, that St.\r\n      James is made to say “This wisdom (_sophia_) descendeth not from\r\n      above, but is earthly, sensual, _devilish_”; now this Sophia is\r\n      Manas, the “Human Soul,” the Spiritual Wisdom or Soul being Buddhi,\r\n      which being so near the Absolute, is, _per se_, only _latent_\r\n      consciousness, and is dependent upon Manas for manifestation beyond\r\n      its own plane.\r\n\r\n  629 This is the “Undying Race,” as it is called in Esotericism, and\r\n      exoterically the fruitless generation of the first progeny of\r\n      Daksha, who curses Nârada, the divine Rishi, for having dissuaded\r\n      the Haryashvas and the Shabalâshvas (the sons of Daksha) from\r\n      procreating their species, by saying: “Be born in the womb; there\r\n      shall not be a resting place for thee in all these regions.” After\r\n      this, Nârada, the representative of that race of _fruitless_\r\n      ascetics, is said, as soon as he dies in one body, to be reborn in\r\n      another.\r\n\r\n  630 Âdi Parvan, p. 113.\r\n\r\n  631 _Vishnu Purâna_, Wilson’s Trans., ii. 12.\r\n\r\n  632 The traditions of every country and nation point to this fact.\r\n      Donnelly quotes from Father Duran’s _Historia Antigua de la Nueva\r\n      España_ of 1885, in which a native of Cholula, a centenarian,\r\n      accounts for the building of the great pyramid of Cholula, as\r\n      follows: “In the beginning, before the light of the sun had been\r\n      created, this land [Cholula] was in obscurity and darkness ... but\r\n      immediately _after the light of the sun arose in the East_, there\r\n      appeared gigantic men ... who built the said pyramid, its builders\r\n      being scattered after that to all parts of the earth.”\r\n\r\n      “A great deal of the Central American history is taken up with the\r\n      doings of an ancient race of Giants called Quinanes,” says the\r\n      author of _Atlantis_ (p. 204).\r\n\r\n  633 _Histoire de la Terre_, p. 154.\r\n\r\n  634 There are critics who, finding no evidence for the existence of\r\n      Tertullian save in the writings of Eusebius, “the veracious,” are\r\n      inclined to doubt it.\r\n\r\n  635 _Heroica_, p. 35.\r\n\r\n  636 _Hist.

Treating of the Chinese Dragon and the literature of\r\n      China, Mr. Charles Gould, in his _Mythical Monsters_ (p. 212),\r\n      writes: “Its mythologies, histories, religions, popular stories, and\r\n      proverbs, all teem with references to a mysterious being _who has a\r\n      physical nature and spiritual attributes_. Gifted with an accepted\r\n      form, which he has the supernatural power of casting off for the\r\n      assumption of others, he has the power of influencing the weather,\r\n      producing droughts or fertilizing rains at pleasure, of raising\r\n      tempests and allaying them. Volumes could be compiled from the\r\n      scattered legends which everywhere abound relating to this subject.”\r\n\r\n      This “mysterious being” is the _mythical_ Dragon, _i.e._, the symbol\r\n      of the _historical_ and actual Adept, the Master and Professor of\r\n      Occult Sciences of old. It has already been stated elsewhere, that\r\n      the great “Magicians” of the Fourth and Fifth Races were generally\r\n      called “Serpents” and “Dragons” after their Progenitors. All these\r\n      belonged to the Hierarchy of the so‐called “Fiery Dragons of\r\n      Wisdom,” the Dhyân Chohans, answering to the Agnishvâtta Pitris, the\r\n      Maruts and Rudras generally, as the issue of Rudra their father, who\r\n      is identified with the God of Fire. More is said in the text. Now\r\n      Clement, an initiated Neo‐Platonist, knew, of course, the origin of\r\n      the word “Dragon,” and why the initiated Adepts were so called, as\r\n      he knew the secret of the Agathodæmon, the Christ, the seven‐\r\n      vowelled Serpent of the Gnostics. He knew that the dogma of his new\r\n      faith required the transformation of all the _rivals_ of Jehovah—the\r\n      Angels supposed to have rebelled against that “Elohim,” as the Titan\r\n      Prometheus rebelled against Zeus, the usurper of his father’s\r\n      kingdom—and that “Dragon” was the mystic appellation of the “Sons of\r\n      Wisdom”; from this knowledge came his definition, as cruel as it was\r\n      arbitrary, “serpents and giants signify _demons_,” _i.e._, not\r\n      “Spirits,” but _Devils_, in Church parlance.\r\n\r\n  641 Part IV, Ch. xxvii, p. 291.\r\n\r\n  642 “What would you say to our affirmation that the Chinese—I now speak\r\n      of the inland, the true Chinamen, not of the hybrid mixture between\r\n      the Fourth and Fifth Races now occupying the throne—the aborigines\r\n      who belong in their unallied nationality wholly to the highest and\r\n      last branch of the Fourth Race, reached their highest civilization\r\n      when the Fifth had hardly appeared in Asia.” (_Esoteric Buddhism_,\r\n      p. 67.) And this handful of the inland Chinese are all of a very\r\n      high stature. Could the most ancient MSS. in the Lolo language (that\r\n      of the aborigines of China) be got at and correctly translated, many\r\n      a priceless piece of evidence would be found. But they are as rare\r\n      as their language is unintelligible. So far, one or two European\r\n      Archæologists only have been able to procure such priceless works.\r\n\r\n  643 Quoted in De Mirville, _op. cit._, iii. 53. Remember the same\r\n      statement in the _Book of Enoch_, as also the ladder seen by Jacob\r\n      in his dream. The “two worlds” mean, of course, the two _planes_ of\r\n      Consciousness and Being. A seer can commune with Beings of a higher\r\n      plane than the Earth, without quitting his arm‐chair.\r\n\r\n  644 See the Commentary on the Four Races—and on the “Sons of Will and\r\n      Yoga,” the immaculate progeny of the Androgynous Third Race.\r\n\r\n  645 In the _Kabalah_ the pronunciation of the four‐lettered _ineffable_\r\n      Name is “a most secret arcanum”—“a secret of secrets.”\r\n\r\n  646 _The Chaldean Account of Genesis_, p. 81.\r\n\r\n  647 _Ibid._, p. 84, lines 12, 14 and 15.\r\n\r\n  648 Returning once more to this most important subject in Archaic\r\n      Cosmogony, even in the Norse legends, in the Sacred Scrolls of the\r\n      Goddess Saga, we find Loki, the brother by blood of Odin—just as\r\n      Typhon, Ahriman, and others are respectively brothers of Osiris and\r\n      Ormazd—becoming evil only later, when he had mingled too long with\r\n      humanity. Like all other Fire or Light Gods—Fire burning and\r\n      destroying as well as warming and giving life—he ended by being\r\n      regarded in the destructive sense of “Fire.” The name _Loki_, we\r\n      learn from _Asgard and the Gods_ (p. 250), has been derived from the\r\n      old word _liuhan_, to enlighten. It has, therefore, the same origin\r\n      as the Latin _lux_, light. Hence Loki is identical with Lucifer or\r\n      Light‐bringer. This title, being given to the Prince of Darkness, is\r\n      very suggestive and is in itself a vindication against theological\r\n      slander. But Loki is still more closely related to Prometheus, for\r\n      he is shown chained to a sharp rock, while Lucifer, also identified\r\n      with Satan, was chained down in Hell; a circumstance, however, which\r\n      prevented neither of them from acting with all freedom on Earth, if\r\n      we accept the theological paradox in its fulness. Loki is a\r\n      beneficent, generous and powerful God in the beginnings of time, and\r\n      the principle of good, and not of evil, in early Scandinavian\r\n      Theogony.\r\n\r\n  649 The Greek mythos alluded to a few pages back, namely the mutilation\r\n      of Uranus by his son Cronus, is an allusion to this “theft” of the\r\n      _divine creative Fire_ by the Son of the Earth and Heavens. If\r\n      Uranus, the personification of the Celestial Powers, has to cease\r\n      creating (he is made impotent by Cronus (Chronos), the God _in\r\n      Time_), so, in the Egyptian Cosmogony, it is Thot, the God of\r\n      Wisdom, who regulates this fight between Horus and Set, the latter\r\n      being served by the former as Uranus is by Cronus. (See _Book of the\r\n      Dead_, xvii, line 26.) In the Babylonian account it is the God Zu,\r\n      who strips the “Father of the Gods” of “_umsimi_”—the ideal creative\r\n      organ, not the “crown” (!) as G. Smith thought (_op. cit._, pp. 115,\r\n      116). For, in the fragment K. 3454 (British Museum), it is said very\r\n      clearly, that Zu having stripped the “venerable of heaven” of his\r\n      _desire_, he carried away the “_umsimi_ of the gods,” and burnt\r\n      thereby “the _tereti_ [the power] of all the gods,” thus “governing\r\n      the whole of the _seed_ of all the angels.” As the _umsimi_ was “_on\r\n      the seat_” of Bel, it could hardly be the “crown.” A fourth version\r\n      is in the _Bible_. Ham is the Chaldæan Zu, and both are cursed for\r\n      the same allegorically described crime.\r\n\r\n  650 Quoted by Christian Ginsburg from the _Kabalah_.\r\n\r\n  651 Schlagintweit, _Buddhism in Tibet_, p. 248. These are the Beings\r\n      whose legendary existence has served as a ground‐work upon which to\r\n      build the Rabbinical Lilith, and what the believers in the _Bible_\r\n      would term the Antediluvian women, and the Kabalists the Pre‐Adamite\r\n      races. They are no fiction—this is certain, however fantastic the\r\n      exuberance of later growth.\r\n\r\n  652 _Op. cit._, pp. 101, 102.\r\n\r\n  653 For suggestiveness, we would recommend a short article by Visconde\r\n      de Figanière, F.T.S., in _The Theosophist_, entitled “Esoteric\r\n      Studies.” Its author expounds therein quite an Occult theory, though\r\n      to the world a new idea—“the _progress_ of the Monad concurring with\r\n      the _retrogression_ of Form, _i.e._, with decrease of the _vis\r\n      formativa_.” (Vol. viii. p. 666.) He says, “Who knows what shape\r\n      vehicled the Ego in remote rings [Rounds, or Races?]?... May not\r\n      man’s type ... have been that of the Simiadæ in its variety? Might\r\n      not the Monkey‐kingdom of Râmâyana fame rest on some far‐off\r\n      tradition relating to a period when that was the common lot, or\r\n      rather aspect, of man?” And the author winds up a very clever,\r\n      though too short, exposition of his theory by saying that which\r\n      every true Occultist will endorse: “With physico‐ethereal man there\r\n      must be _involution_ of sex. As physico‐astral man depended on\r\n      entities of the sub‐human class (evolved from animal prototypes) for\r\n      rebirth, so will physico‐ethereal man find among the graceful,\r\n      shapely orders issuing from the _air_‐plane, one or more which will\r\n      be developed for his successive embodiments _when procreated forms\r\n      are given_—a process which will include all mankind only very\r\n      gradually. The [_Pre_‐?] Adamic and Post‐Adamic races were giants;\r\n      their ethereal counterparts may possibly be liliputians—beauteous,\r\n      luminous, diaphanous—but will assuredly be giants in mind” (p. 671).\r\n\r\n  654 It may be objected that this is a contradiction. That, as the first\r\n      Root‐Race appeared 300,000,000 years after the vegetation had\r\n      evolved, the Seed of vegetable life could not be in the First Race.\r\n      We say it could; for up to man’s appearance in _this_ Round, the\r\n      vegetation was of quite another kind to what it is now, and quite\r\n      ethereal; this, for the simple reason that no grass or plants could\r\n      have been physical, before there were animal or other organisms to\r\n      breathe out the carbonic acid which vegetation has to imbibe for its\r\n      development, its nutrition and growth. They are interdependent in\r\n      their _physical_ and achieved forms.\r\n\r\n  655 _Zohar_, i. 21a.\r\n\r\n  656 _Ibid._, iii. 48a.\r\n\r\n  657 _Ibid._, ii. 76a.\r\n\r\n  658 _Op. cit._, p. 666.\r\n\r\n  659 It is stated in the _Zohar_ that the “primordial worlds” (sparks)\r\n      could not continue because _man was not as yet_. “The _human_ form\r\n      contains everything; and as it did not as yet exist, the worlds were\r\n      destroyed.”\r\n\r\n  660 “The Sacred Books of the East,” vol. iv; _The Vendîdâd_, J.\r\n      Darmesteter; Fargard ii. vv. 27 (70) and 28 (74).\r\n\r\n  661 This is the meaning when the allegory and symbol are opened and read\r\n      by means of the _human_ key, or the key to Terrestrial\r\n      Anthroposophy. This interpretation of the “Ark” symbolism does not\r\n      in the least interfere with its astronomical, or even theogonic\r\n      keys; nor with any of the other six meanings. Nor does it seem less\r\n      scientific than the modern theories about the origin of man.

Such _reversions_ are imperfect, yet undeniable\r\n      reproductions of the original towering man of primeval times.\r\n\r\n  672 See _Mythical Monsters_, by Ch. Gould, from whose interesting and\r\n      scientific volume a few passages are quoted further on. See also, in\r\n      A. P. Sinnett’s _Occult World_, the description of a cavern in the\r\n      Himâlayas filled with relics of giant human and animal bones.\r\n\r\n  673 _I.e._, the Third Eye was at the back of the head. The statement\r\n      that the latest hermaphrodite humanity was “four‐armed,” unriddles\r\n      probably the mystery of all the representations and idols of the\r\n      exoteric Gods of India. On the Acropolis of Argos, there was a\r\n      ξόανον, a rudely carved wooden statue, attributed to Dædalus,\r\n      representing a three‐eyed colossus, which was consecrated to Zeus\r\n      Triôpês, the “Three‐eyed.” The head of the “god” has two eyes in its\r\n      face and one above on the top of the forehead. It is considered the\r\n      most archaic of all the ancient statues. (_Schol. Vatic, ad Eurip.\r\n      Troad._, 14.)\r\n\r\n  674 The _inner vision_ could henceforth be acquired only through\r\n      training and initiation, save in the cases of “natural and born\r\n      magicians”—sensitives and mediums, as they are called now.\r\n\r\n  675 This expression “petrified” instead of “ossified” is curious. The\r\n      “back eye,” which is of course the Pineal Gland, so‐called, the\r\n      small pea‐like mass of grey nervous matter attached to the back of\r\n      the third ventricle of the brain, is said to almost invariably\r\n      contain _mineral concretions_ and _sand_, and “nothing more.”\r\n\r\n  676 “Deeply placed within the head, covered by thick skin and muscles,\r\n      true eyes, that cannot see, are found in certain animals,” says\r\n      Hæckel. “Among the Vertebrata there are blind moles and field‐mice,\r\n      blind snakes and lizards.... They shun the daylight, dwelling ...\r\n      under the ground.... [They] were _not originally blind_, but have\r\n      evolved from ancestors that lived in the light and had well‐\r\n      developed eyes. The atrophied eye beneath the opaque skin may be\r\n      found in these blind beings in every stage of reversion.” (Hæckel,\r\n      _Pedigree of Man_, “Sense Organs.” p. 343: Aveling’s Trans.) And if\r\n      _two_ eyes could become so atrophied in lower animals, why not _one_\r\n      eye—the Pineal Gland—in man, who is but a higher animal in his\r\n      physical aspect?\r\n\r\n  677 _Op. cit._, ii. 830, 831, ninth edition; “The Thalamencephalon or\r\n      Inter‐brain.”\r\n\r\n  678 The “nervous ether” of Dr. B. W. Richardson, F.R.S.; the nerve‐aura\r\n      of Occultism. The “animal spirits” (?) are equivalent to the\r\n      currents of nerve‐auric compound circulation.\r\n\r\n  679 Let us remember that the _First_ Race is shown, in Occult Science,\r\n      as spiritual within and ethereal without; the _Second_, psycho‐\r\n      spiritual mentally, and ethereo‐physical bodily; the _Third_, still\r\n      bereft of intellect in its beginning, is astro‐physical in its body,\r\n      and lives an inner life, in which the psycho‐spiritual element is in\r\n      no way as yet interfered with by the hardly nascent physiological\r\n      senses. Its two front eyes look before them without seeing either\r\n      past or future. But the Third Eye “_embraces Eternity_.”\r\n\r\n  680 But in a very different manner to that pictured by Hæckel as an\r\n      “_evolution by Natural Selection in the struggle for existence_”\r\n      (_Pedigree of Man_, “Sense Organs,” p. 335; Aveling’s Trans.). The\r\n      mere “thermal sensibility of the skin,” to hypothetical light‐waves,\r\n      is absurdly incompetent to account for the beautiful combination of\r\n      adaptations existing in the eye. We have shown that “natural\r\n      selection” is a pure myth when credited with the _origination_ of\r\n      variations, as the “survival of the fittest” can only take place\r\n      after useful variations have sprung up, together with improved\r\n      organisms. Whence came the “useful variations,” which developed the\r\n      eye? Only from “blind forces ... without aim, without design”? The\r\n      argument is puerile. The true solution of the mystery is to be found\r\n      in the impersonal Divine Wisdom, in its Ideation—reflected through\r\n      Matter.\r\n\r\n  681 Palæontology has ascertained that in the animals of the Mesozoic\r\n      age—the Saurians especially, such as the antediluvian Labyrinthodon,\r\n      whose fossil skull exhibits a perforation otherwise inexplicable—the\r\n      third, or odd eye must have been much developed. Several\r\n      Naturalists, among others E. Korscheldt, feel convinced that\r\n      whereas, notwithstanding the opaque skin covering it, such an eye in\r\n      the reptiles of the present period can only distinguish light from\r\n      darkness (as the human eyes do when bound with a handkerchief, or\r\n      even tightly closed), in the now extinct animals that eye functioned\r\n      and was a real organ of vision.\r\n\r\n  682 Gould’s _Mythical Monsters_, p. 27.\r\n\r\n  683 Karma is a word of many meanings, and has a special term for almost\r\n      every one of its aspects. As a synonym of sin, it means the\r\n      performance of some action for the attainment of an object of\r\n      _worldly_, hence _selfish_, desire, which cannot fail to be hurtful\r\n      to somebody else. Karma is action, the cause; and Karma again is the\r\n      “Law of Ethical Causation”; the _effect_ of an act produced\r\n      egotistically, in face of the great Law of Harmony which depends on\r\n      altruism.\r\n\r\n  684 Objectors to the doctrine of Karma should recall the fact that it is\r\n      absolutely out of the question to attempt a reply to the Pessimists\r\n      on other data. A firm grasp of the principles of Karmic Law knocks\r\n      away the whole basis of the imposing fabric reared by the disciples\r\n      of Schopenhauer and Von Hartmann.\r\n\r\n  685 The doctrine and theology of the Calvinists. “The purpose of God\r\n      _from eternity_ respecting all events”—which becomes _fatalism_ and\r\n      kills free will, or any attempt of exerting it for good. “It is the\r\n      preässignment or allotment of men to everlasting happiness or\r\n      misery.” (_Catechism._) A noble and encouraging doctrine this!\r\n\r\n  686 In order to make Karma more comprehensible to the Western mind,\r\n      which is better acquainted with the Greek than with Âryan\r\n      philosophy, some Theosophists have made an attempt to translate it\r\n      by Nemesis. Had Nemesis been known to the Profane in antiquity, as\r\n      it was understood by the Initiate, this translation of the term\r\n      would be unobjectionable. As it is, Nemesis has been too much\r\n      anthropomorphized by Greek fancy to permit our using it without an\r\n      elaborate explanation. With the early Greeks, “from Homer to\r\n      Herodotus, she was no goddess, but a _moral feeling_ rather,” says\r\n      Decharme; the barrier to evil and immorality. He who transgresses\r\n      it, commits a sacrilege in the eyes of the Gods, and is pursued by\r\n      Nemesis. But, with time, that “feeling” was deified, and its\r\n      personification became an ever‐fatal and punishing Goddess.\r\n      Therefore, if we would connect Karma with Nemesis, we must do so in\r\n      her triple character as Nemesis, Adrasteia and Themis. For, while\r\n      the last is the Goddess of Universal Order and Harmony, who, like\r\n      Nemesis, is commissioned to repress every excess, and keep man\r\n      within the limits of Nature and righteousness under severe penalty,\r\n      Adrasteia, the “inevitable,” represents Nemesis as the immutable\r\n      effect of causes created by man himself. Nemesis, as the daughter of\r\n      Dikê, is the equitable Goddess reserving her wrath for those alone\r\n      who are maddened with pride, egoïsm, and impiety. (See Mesomed.,\r\n      _Hymn. Nemes._, v. 2, from Brunck, _Analecta_ II. p. 292; quoted in\r\n      _Mythologie de la Grèce Antique_, p. 304.) In short, while Nemesis\r\n      is a mythological, exoteric Goddess, or _Power_, personified and\r\n      anthropomorphized in its various aspects, Karma is a highly\r\n      philosophical truth, a most divine and noble expression of the\r\n      primitive intuition of man concerning Deity. It is a doctrine which\r\n      explains the origin of Evil, and ennobles our conceptions of what\r\n      divine immutable Justice ought to be, instead of degrading the\r\n      unknown and unknowable Deity by making it the whimsical, cruel\r\n      tyrant, which we call “Providence.”\r\n\r\n  687 Pralaya—a word already explained—is not a term that applies _only_\r\n      to every “Night of Brahmâ,” or the World’s Dissolution following\r\n      every Manvantara, equal to 71 Mahâyugas. It applies also to each\r\n      “Obscuration” as well, and even to every Cataclysm that puts an end,\r\n      by Fire or by Water in turn, to each Root‐Race. Pralaya is a general\r\n      term like the word “Manu” the generic name for the Shishtas, who,\r\n      under the appellation of “Kings,” are said in the _Purânas_ to be\r\n      preserved “with the seed of all things, in an ark, from the waters\r\n      of that inundation [or the fires of a general volcanic\r\n      conflagration, the commencement of which we already see for our\r\n      Fifth Race in the terrible earthquakes and eruptions of these late\r\n      years, and especially in the present year (1888)], which, in the\r\n      season of a Pralaya overspreads the world [the Earth].” (_Vishnu\r\n      Purâna_, Wilson’s Trans., I. lxxxi.) Time is only a form of\r\n      Vishnu—truly, as Parâshara says in the _Vishnu Purâna_. In the Hindû\r\n      Yugas and Kalpas, we have the regular descending series 4, 3, 2,\r\n      with ciphers, multiplied, as occasion requires, for Esoteric\r\n      purposes, but not, as Wilson and other Orientalists thought, for\r\n      “sectarian embellishments.” A Kalpa may be an Age, or Day of Brahmâ,\r\n      or a sidereal Kalpa, astronomical and earthly. These calculations\r\n      are found in all the _Purânas_, but some differ—as for instance, the\r\n      “Year of the seven Rishis,” 3,030 mortal years, and the “Year of\r\n      Dhruva,” 9,090, in the _Linga Purâna_, which are again Esoteric, and\r\n      _do_ represent actual (and secret) chronology. As said in the\r\n      _Brahma Vaivarta_: “Chronologers compute a Kalpa by the life of\r\n      Brahmâ. _Minor_ Kalpas, as Samvarta and the rest, are numerous.”\r\n      “Minor Kalpas” denote here every period of Destruction, as was well\r\n      understood by Wilson himself, who explains the latter as “those in\r\n      which the Samvarta wind or other destructive agents operate.”\r\n      (_Ibid._, p. 54.)\r\n\r\n  688 An intuition and a presentiment of the Shishtas may be found in Mr.\r\n      Sinnett’s _Esoteric Buddhism_. See the “Annotations”—the “Noah’s Ark\r\n      Theory,” pp. 146, 147, fifth edition.\r\n\r\n  689 The fact that Manu himself is made to declare that he was created by\r\n      Virâj, and that he then produced the ten Prajápatis, who again\r\n      produced seven Manus, who in their turn gave birth to seven other\r\n      Manus (_Manu_, i. 33‐36) relates to other still earlier mysteries,\r\n      and is at the same time a “blind” with regard to the doctrine of the\r\n      Septenary Chain, and the simultaneous evolution of seven Humanities,\r\n      or Men. However, the present work is written on the records of Cis‐\r\n      Himâlayan Secret Teachings, and Brâhmanical Esoteric Philosophy may\r\n      now differ in form as does the Kabalah. But they were identical in\r\n      hoary antiquity.\r\n\r\n  690 There is another Esoteric reason besides this for it. A Vaivasvata\r\n      is the _seventh_ Manu, because this our Round, although the Fourth,\r\n      is in the _preseptenary_ Manvantara, and the Round itself is in its\r\n      _seventh_ stage of materiality or physicality. The close of its\r\n      middle racial point occurred during the Fourth Root‐Race, when Man\r\n      and all Nature reached their lowest state of gross Matter. From that\r\n      time, _i.e._, from the end of the three and a half Races, Humanity\r\n      and Nature entered on the ascending arc of their Racial Cycle.\r\n\r\n  691 The interval that precedes each Yuga is called a Sandhyâ, composed\r\n      of as many hundreds of years as there are thousands in the Yuga; and\r\n      that which follows the latter is named Sandhyâmsha, and is of\r\n      similar duration, as we are told in _Vishnu Purâna_. “The interval\r\n      between the Sandhyâ and the Sandhyâmsha is the Yuga denominated\r\n      Krita, Tretâ, etc. The [four] Krita, Tretâ, Dvâpara, and Kali\r\n      constitute a great age, or aggregate of four ages: a thousand such\r\n      aggregates are a Day of Brahmâ; and fourteen _Manus reign within\r\n      that term_.” (_Op. cit._, _ibid._, p. 49.) Now had we to accept this\r\n      literally then there would be only one Manu for every 4,320,000,000\r\n      years. As we are taught that it took 300 million years for the two\r\n      lower kingdoms to evolve, and that our Humanity is just 18 and some\r\n      odd millions old—where were the other Manus spoken of, unless the\r\n      allegory means what the Esoteric Doctrine teaches as to the 14 being\r\n      each multiplied by 49.\r\n\r\n  692 The words “Creation,” “Dissolution,” etc., do not correctly render\r\n      the right meaning of either Manvantara or Pralaya. The _Vishnu\r\n      Purâna_ enumerates several: “The dissolution of all things is of\r\n      four kinds,” Parâshara is made to say: Naimittika (Occasional), when\r\n      Brahmâ slumbers (his Night, when, “at the end of this Day occurs a\r\n      re‐coalescence _of the Universe_, called Brahmâ’s contingent re‐\r\n      coalescence,” because Brahmâ _is_ this Universe itself); Prâkritika\r\n      (Elemental), when the return of this Universe to its original nature\r\n      is partial and physical; Âtyantika (Absolute), identification of the\r\n      _Embodied_ with the incorporeal Supreme Spirit—Mahâtmic state,\r\n      whether temporary or until the following Mahâ Kalpa: also Absolute\r\n      Obscuration—as of a whole Planetary Chain, etc.; and Nitya\r\n      (Perpetual), Mahâ Pralaya for the Universe, _Death_—for man. Nitya\r\n      is the extinction of life, like the “extinction of a lamp,” also “in\r\n      sleep at night.” Nitya Sarga is “constant or perpetual creation,” as\r\n      Nitya Pralaya is “constant or perpetual destruction of all that is\r\n      born.” “That which ensues after a minor dissolution is called\r\n      ephemeral creation.” (_Vishnu Purâna_, Wilson’s Trans., i. 113,\r\n      114.) The subject is so difficult that we are obliged to repeat our\r\n      statements.\r\n\r\n  693 But see the superb definitions of Parabrahman and the Logos in T.\r\n      Subba Row’s Lectures on the _Bhagavad Gîtâ_ in the early numbers of\r\n      _The Theosophist_ of 1887.\r\n\r\n  694 See preceding foot‐note.\r\n\r\n  695 See _Manu_, i. 32, 33. Vaishvânara is, in another sense, the living\r\n      magnetic fire that pervades the manifested Solar System. It is the\r\n      most objective (though to us the reverse) and ever present aspect of\r\n      the One Life, for it is the Vital Principle. (See _Theosophist_,\r\n      July, 1883, p. 249.) It is also a name of Agni.\r\n\r\n  696 _Op. cit._, pp. 134, 135.\r\n\r\n  697 This—in the period of _Secondary_ Creation, so called. Of the\r\n      _Primary_, when Earth is in possession of the three _Elemental_\r\n      Kingdoms, we cannot speak for several reasons, one of which is,\r\n      that, no one but a great seer, or one naturally intuitional, will be\r\n      able to realize that which can never be expressed in any existing\r\n      terms.\r\n\r\n  698 Hippocrates said that number _seven_ “by its occult virtues tended\r\n      to the accomplishment of all things, to be the dispenser of life and\r\n      fountain of all its changes.” The life of man he divided into seven\r\n      ages, as did Shakespeare, for “as the moon changes her phases every\r\n      seven days, this number influences all sublunary beings,” and even\r\n      the Earth, as we know. The teeth of a child appear in the seventh\r\n      month, and he sheds them at seven years; at twice seven puberty\r\n      begins, at three times seven his mental and vital powers are\r\n      developed, at four times seven he is in his full strength, at five\r\n      times seven his passions are most developed, etc. Thus also for the\r\n      Earth; it is now in its middle age, yet very little wiser for it.\r\n      The Tetragrammaton, the four‐lettered sacred name of the Deity, can\r\n      be resolved on Earth only by becoming septenary through the manifest\r\n      Triangle proceeding from the concealed Tetraktys. Therefore, the\r\n      number seven has to be adopted on this plane. As written in the\r\n      _Kabalah_ (“The Greater Holy Assembly,” v. 1161): “For assuredly\r\n      there is no stability in those six, save (what they derive) from the\r\n      _seventh_. For _all things depend_ from the _seventh_.” (S. L.\r\n      MacGregor Mathers’ _Kabbalah_, p. 255.)\r\n\r\n  699 Compare Stanzas III. _et seqq._\r\n\r\n  700 St. Augustin says of Jesus: “He is a _fish_ that lives in the midst\r\n      of waters.” Christians called themselves “Little\r\n      Fishes”—_Pisciculi_—in their sacred Mysteries. “So many _fishes_\r\n      bred in the _water_, and saved by _one great fish_,” says Tertullian\r\n      of the Christians and Christ and the Church.\r\n\r\n  701 _Esoteric Buddhism_, p. 55.\r\n\r\n  702 This event—viz., the destruction of the famous island of Ruta and\r\n      the smaller island Daitya—which occurred 850,000 years ago in the\r\n      later Pliocene times, must not be confounded with the submersion of\r\n      the main Continent of Atlantis during the Miocene period. Geologists\r\n      cannot bring the Miocene so near as 850,000 years, whatever they may\r\n      do; it is, in reality, several million years ago that the main\r\n      Atlantis perished.\r\n\r\n  703 See _The Athenæum_, Aug. 25th, 1860.\r\n\r\n  704 Mr. Huxley divides these races into the quintuple group of\r\n      Australoids, Negroids, Mongoloids, Xanthochroics and\r\n      Melanochroics—all issuing from imaginary Anthropoids. And yet, while\r\n      protesting against those who say “that the structural differences\r\n      between man and apes are small and insignificant,” and adding that\r\n      “every bone of the gorilla bears a mark by which it can be\r\n      distinguished from a corresponding human bone, and that in the\r\n      present state of creation, at least, no intermediary being fills the\r\n      gap which separates the man from the troglodyte”—the great Anatomist\r\n      goes on speaking of the _simian_ characteristics in man! (See de\r\n      Quatrefages, _The Human Species_, P. 113.)\r\n\r\n  705 _Op. cit._, Isaac Myer, p. 422.\r\n\r\n  706 _Zohar_, i. 119b, col. 475; _ibid._, p. 412.\r\n\r\n  707 The Lemurians.\r\n\r\n  708 Lava.\r\n\r\n  709 Marble.\r\n\r\n  710 Of the subterranean fires.\r\n\r\n  711 This is the reason, perhaps, why even Easter Island, with its\r\n      wondrous gigantic statues—a speaking witness to a submerged\r\n      continent with a civilized mankind on it—is hardly mentioned\r\n      anywhere in modern Encyclopædias. Its mention is carefully avoided\r\n      except in some books of travels. Modern Science has an undeniable\r\n      predilection for forcing hypotheses, built on personal hobbies, upon\r\n      the cultured public, as well‐established evidence: for offering it\r\n      _guesses_ instead of knowledge, and calling them “scientific\r\n      conclusions.” Its specialists will evolve a thousand and one\r\n      contradictory speculations rather than confess an _awkward self‐\r\n      evident fact_—preëminent among such specialists being Hæckel and his\r\n      English admirers and co‐thinkers. Yet “they are authorities”—we are\r\n      sternly reminded. What of that? The Pope of Rome is also an\r\n      authority and an infallible one—for _his_ followers; whereas the\r\n      remarkable fallibility of scientific speculations is being proven\r\n      periodically with every change of the moon.\r\n\r\n  712 Our best modern novelists, although they are neither Theosophists\r\n      nor Spiritualists, nevertheless begin to have very psychological and\r\n      suggestively Occult dreams; witness Mr. Robert Louis Stevenson and\r\n      his _Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_, than which no grander\r\n      psychological essay on Occult lines exists. Has the rising novelist\r\n      Mr. Rider Haggard also had a prophetic, or rather a retrospective,\r\n      clairvoyant dream before he wrote _She_? His imperial Kor, the great\r\n      city of the dead, whose surviving inhabitants sailed northwards\r\n      after the plague had killed almost a whole nation, seems, in its\r\n      general outlines, to step out from the imperishable pages of the old\r\n      archaic records. Ayesha suggests “that those men who sailed north\r\n      may have been the fathers of the first Egyptians”; and then seems to\r\n      attempt a synopsis of certain letters of a Master quoted in\r\n      _Esoteric Buddhism_, for, she says: “Time after time have nations,\r\n      ay, and rich and strong nations, learned in the arts, been, and\r\n      passed away, and been forgotten, so that no memory of them remains.\r\n      This [the nation of Kor] is but one of several; for time eats up the\r\n      work of man unless, indeed, he digs in caves like the people of Kor,\r\n      and _then mayhap the sea swallows them, or the earthquake shakes\r\n      them in_.... Yet were not these people utterly destroyed, as I\r\n      think. Some few remained in the other cities, for their cities were\r\n      many. But the barbarians ... came down upon them, and took their\r\n      women to wife, and the race of the Amahagger that is now is a\r\n      bastard brood of the mighty sons of Kor, and behold it dwelleth in\r\n      the tombs with its fathers’ bones” (pp. 180, 181).\r\n\r\n      Here the clever novelist seems to repeat the history of all the now\r\n      degraded and down‐fallen races of humanity. Geologists and\r\n      Anthropologists would place at the head of humanity—as descendants\r\n      of Homo Primigenius—the ape‐man, of which “_no fossil remains are as\r\n      yet known to us_,” though they “were _probably_ akin to the\r\n      _Gorilla_ and _Orang of the present day_” (Hæckel). In answer to\r\n      whose “probably,” Occultists point to another and a greater\r\n      probability—viz., the one given in our text.\r\n\r\n  713 Robert Brown, _The Countries of the World_, vol. iv. p. 43.\r\n\r\n  714 See Stanza II. This would account for the variation and great\r\n      difference between the intellectual capacities of races, nations,\r\n      and individual men. While incarnating into, and in other cases only\r\n      informing, the human vehicles evolved by the first brainless\r\n      (“manas‐less”) Race, the incarnating Powers and Principles had to\r\n      take into account, and make their choice between, the past Karmas of\r\n      the Monads, between which and their bodies they had to become the\r\n      connecting link. Moreover, as correctly stated in _Esoteric\r\n      Buddhism_ (p. 30), “the fifth principle, or human (intellectual)\r\n      soul, in the majority of mankind is not even yet fully developed.”\r\n\r\n  715 It is said by the incarnate Logos, Krishna, in the _Bhagavad Gîtâ_,\r\n      “The seven great Rishis, the four preceding Manus, partaking of my\r\n      nature, were born from my mind: from them sprang [emanated or were\r\n      born] the human race and the world” (x. 6).\r\n\r\n      Here, by the seven Great Rishis, the seven great Rûpa Hierarchies or\r\n      Classes of Dhyân Chohans, are meant. Let us bear in mind that the\r\n      seven Rishis, Saptarshi, are the Regents of the seven stars of the\r\n      Great Bear, and therefore, of the same nature as the Angels of the\r\n      Planets, or the seven Great Planetary Spirits. They were all reborn\r\n      as men on Earth in various Kalpas and Races. Moreover, “the four\r\n      preceding Manus” are the four Classes of the originally Arûpa\r\n      Gods—the Kumâras, the Rudras, the Asuras, etc.; who are also said\r\n      _to have incarnated_. They are not Prajâpatis, as are the first, but\r\n      their informing “principles”—some of which have incarnated in men,\r\n      while others have made other men simply the vehicles of their\r\n      “reflections.” As Krishna truly says—the same words being repeated\r\n      later by another _vehicle_ of the Logos—“I am the the same to all\r\n      beings ... those who worship me [the sixth principle or the _divine_\r\n      Intellectual Soul, Buddhi, made conscious by its union with the\r\n      higher faculties of Manas] _are in me, and I am in them_.” (_Ibid._,\r\n      x. 29.) The Logos, being no “personality” but the Universal\r\n      Principle, is represented by all the divine Powers, _born of its\r\n      Mind_—the pure Flames, or, as they are called in Occultism, the\r\n      “Intellectual Breaths”—those Angels who are said to _have made\r\n      themselves independent_, _i.e._, passed from the passive and\r\n      quiescent, into the active state of Self‐Consciousness. When this is\r\n      recognized, the true meaning of Krishna becomes comprehensible. But\r\n      see Mr. Subba Row’s excellent Lecture on the _Bhagavad Gîtâ_\r\n      (_Theosophist_, April, 1887, p. 444).\r\n\r\n  716 _Op. cit._, p. 152.\r\n\r\n  717 It was the northern parts of the Toyâmbudhi, or sea of fresh water,\r\n      in Shveta‐dvîpa, which the seven Kumâras—Sanaka, Sananda, Sanâtana,\r\n      Sanatkumâra, Jâta, Vodhu, and Panchashikha—visited agreeably with\r\n      exoteric tradition. (See the Uttara Khanda of the _Padma Purâna,\r\n      Asiatick Researches_, vol. xi. pp. 99, 100.)\r\n\r\n  718 _Vishnu Purâna_, Wilson’s Trans., ii. 109.\r\n\r\n  719 See _Bibliotheca Indica_, Trans. of the _Golâdhyâya of the\r\n      Siddhânta‐shiromani_, iii. 21‐44.\r\n\r\n  720 _Ibid._, pp. 106, 107.\r\n\r\n  721 P. 321.\r\n\r\n  722 Wilson, _ibid._, p. 137.\r\n\r\n  723 In a lecture, Professor Pengelly, F.R.S., quotes Professor Oliver to\r\n      the effect “that the present Atlantic islands’ flora affords no\r\n      substantial evidence of a former direct communication with the\r\n      mainland of the New World,” but adds himself that, at the same time,\r\n      “at some period of the Tertiary epoch, N.‐E. Asia was united to\r\n      N.‐W. America, perhaps by the line where the Aleutian chain of\r\n      islands now extends.” Thus Occult Science alone can reconcile the\r\n      contradictions and hesitations of Modern Science. But again, surely\r\n      the argument for the existence of Atlantis does not rest on Botany\r\n      alone.\r\n\r\n  724 _Vishnu Purâna_, Wilson, v. 381, 382.\r\n\r\n  725 As shown in the “Preliminary Notes” to this Volume, it stands to\r\n      reason that neither the name of Lemuria nor even of Atlantis are the\r\n      real _archaic_ names of the lost Continents. They have been adopted\r\n      by us simply for the sake of clearness. Atlantis was the name given\r\n      to those portions of the submerged Fourth Race Continent which were\r\n      “beyond the Pillars of Hercules,” and which happened to keep above\r\n      water after the general Cataclysm. The last remnant of these—Plato’s\r\n      Atlantis, or “Poseidonis,” which is another _substitute_, or rather\r\n      a translation of the real name—was the last of the Continent above\r\n      water some 11,000 years ago. Most of the correct names of the\r\n      countries and islands of both Continents are given in the _Purânas_;\r\n      but to mention them specially, as found in other more ancient works,\r\n      such as the _Sûrya Siddhânta_, would necessitate too lengthy\r\n      explanations. If, in earlier writings, the two seem to have been too\r\n      faintly distinguished, this must be due to careless reading and want\r\n      of reflection. If ages hence, Europeans are referred to as Âryans,\r\n      and a reader confuses them with the Hindûs and the latter with the\r\n      Fourth Race, because some of them lived in ancient Lankâ—the blame\r\n      will not fall on the writer.\r\n\r\n  726 See Part III, Section VI, of this Volume.\r\n\r\n  727 See Professor J. D. Dana’s article, _American Journal of Science_,\r\n      III. v. 442, 443; Winchell’s _World‐Life_, p. 352.\r\n\r\n  728 Speaking on periodical elevation and subsidence of the equatorial\r\n      and polar regions, and ensuing changes of climate, Dr. Winchell,\r\n      Professor of Geology in the University of Michigan, says: “As the\r\n      movements here contemplated are cyclical, the same conditions would\r\n      recur again and again; and accordingly the same fauna might return\r\n      again and again to the same region, with intervals of occupation by\r\n      another fauna. Progressive sedimentation would preserve the records\r\n      of such faunal alterations; and there would be presented the\r\n      phenomena of ‘colonies,’ ‘reäpparitions,’ and other faunal\r\n      dislocations in the vertical and horizontal distributions of fossil\r\n      remains. These phenomena are well known to the student of geology.”\r\n      (_Op. cit._, p. 281.)\r\n\r\n  729 See _American Naturalist_, xviii. 15‐26.\r\n\r\n  730 _Five Years of Theosophy_, pp. 339, 340.\r\n\r\n  731 _Pedigree of Man_, Aveling’s Trans., pp. 80, 81.\r\n\r\n  732 _Ibid._, p. 82.\r\n\r\n  733 _Op. cit._, p. 81.\r\n\r\n  734 _Esoteric Buddhism_, p. 65.\r\n\r\n  735 “Half‐grown babes” in comparison with their giant brethren on other\r\n      Zones. So would we now, should a like calamity overtake us.\r\n\r\n  736 This relates to Lemuria.\r\n\r\n  737 There are other cycles, of course, _cycles within cycles_—and it is\r\n      just this which creates such a difficulty in the calculations of\r\n      racial events. The circuit of the ecliptic is completed in 25,868\r\n      years, and, with regard to our Earth, it is calculated that the\r\n      equinoctial point falls back 50.1\" annually. But there is another\r\n      cycle within this one. It is said that: “As the apsis goes forward\r\n      to meet it at the rate of 11.24”, annually, this would complete a\r\n      revolution in one hundred and fifteen thousand three hundred and two\r\n      years (115,302). The approximation of the equinox and the apsis is\r\n      the sum of these motions, 61.34\", and hence the equinox returns to\r\n      the same position in relation to the apsis in 21,128 years. (See the\r\n      article on “Astronomy” in the _Encyclopædia Britannica_.) We\r\n      mentioned this cycle in _Isis Unveiled_ (vol. i), in relation to\r\n      other cycles. Each has a marked influence on its contemporary race.\r\n\r\n  738 The Atlanteans.\r\n\r\n  739 Twenty‐seven feet.\r\n\r\n  740 The Lemurians.\r\n\r\n  741 Race.\r\n\r\n  742 Compare the following Section, entitled “Cyclopean Ruins and\r\n      Colossal Stones as Witnesses to Giants.”\r\n\r\n  743 See Denon’s _Voyage en Egypte_, vol. ii.\r\n\r\n  744 See _Esoteric Buddhism_, p. 65.\r\n\r\n  745 _Cf._ the chart adapted from the _Challenger_ and _Dolphin_\r\n      soundings in Donnelly’s _Atlantis: the Antediluvian World_, p. 47.\r\n\r\n  746 _Esoteric Buddhism_, p. 58.\r\n\r\n  747 _History of English Literature_, p. 23.\r\n\r\n  748 Quoted in _Atlantis_, p. 132.\r\n\r\n  749 _Numbers_, xiii. 33.\r\n\r\n  750 _Deut._, iii. 11.\r\n\r\n  751 Robert Brown, _The Countries of the World_, p. 43.\r\n\r\n  752 Mentioned on pp. 44, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n  753 _Ibid._, pp. 43, 44, _et seqq._, and pp. 310, 311.\r\n\r\n  754 De la Vega, IX. ix, quoted in De Mirville’s _Pneumatologie_, iii.\r\n      55.\r\n\r\n  755 The first and second, in common with Bartholdi’s statue, have an\r\n      entrance at the foot, leading by a winding staircase cut in the rock\r\n      up into the heads.

(See Hodson’s _Letters from North America_, vol. ii. p.\r\n      440.) Pliny speaks of several in Asia (_Hist.

If Ham was a Titan or Giant then were\r\n      Shem and Japhet also Titans. They are either all Arkite Titans, as\r\n      Faber shows—or myths.\r\n\r\n  769 Diodorus Siculus asserts that in the days of Isis, some men were\r\n      still of a vast stature, and were denominated by the Hellenes\r\n      Giants. “Οἱ δὲν Αἰγύπτῳ μυθογοῦσι κατὰ τὴν Ἰσιδὸς ἡλικίαν γεγονέναι\r\n      τίνας πολυσωμάτους.”\r\n\r\n  770 _Antiquités Celtiques_, p. 88.\r\n\r\n  771 Cambry, _ibid._, 90.\r\n\r\n  772 _Op. cit._, p. 473. “It is difficult,” writes Creuzer, “not to\r\n      suspect in the structures of Tiryns and Mycenæ planetary forces\r\n      supposed to be moved by celestial powers, analogous to the famous\r\n      Dactyli.” (_Pelasges et Cyclopes._) To this day Science is in\r\n      ignorance on the subject of the Cyclopes. They are supposed to have\r\n      built all the so‐called “Cyclopean” works whose erection would have\r\n      necessitated several regiments of Giants, and yet they were only\r\n      seventy‐seven in all, or about one hundred, as Creuzer thinks. They\r\n      are called Builders, and Occultism calls them the _Initiators_, who\r\n      by initiating some Pelasgians, thus laid the foundation stone of\r\n      true _Masonry_. Herodotus associates the Cyclops with Perseus “the\r\n      son of an Assyrian demon” (I. vi.). Raoul Rochette found that\r\n      Palæmonius, the Cyclops, to whom a sanctuary was raised, was the\r\n      “Tyrian Hercules.” In any case, he was the Builder of the sacred\r\n      columns of Gadir, covered with mysterious characters—of which\r\n      Apollonius of Tyana was the only one in his age who possessed the\r\n      key—and with figures which may still be found on the walls of\r\n      Ellora, the gigantic ruins of the temple of Vishvakarman, “the\r\n      builder and artificer of the Gods.”\r\n\r\n  773 _Hist. Nat._, t. xxxvi. p. 592; De Mirville, _op. cit._, _ibid._, p.\r\n      289.\r\n\r\n  774 _Dieu et les Dieux_, p. 567.\r\n\r\n  775 De Mirville, _op. cit._, _ibid._, p. 291. Messrs. Richardson and\r\n      Barth are said to have been amazed at finding in the Desert of\r\n      Sahara the same trilithic and raised stones which they had seen in\r\n      Asia, Circassia, Etruria, and in all the North of Europe. Mr.\r\n      Rivett‐Carnac, B.C.S., of Allahabad, the distinguished Archæologist,\r\n      shows the same amazement on finding the description, given by Sir J.\r\n      Simpson, of the cuplike markings on stones and rocks in England,\r\n      Scotland, and other Western countries; “offering an extraordinary\r\n      resemblance” to “the marks on the trap boulders which encircle the\r\n      barrows near Nagpur”—the City of Snakes. The eminent scholar saw in\r\n      this “another and very extraordinary addition to the mass of\r\n      evidence ... that a branch of the nomadic tribes, who swept at an\r\n      early date over Europe, penetrated into India also.” We say Lemuria,\r\n      Atlantis and her Giants, and the earliest races of the Fifth Root‐\r\n      Race had all a hand in these betyli, lithoi, and “magic” stones in\r\n      general. The cup‐marks noticed by Sir J. Simpson, and the “holes\r\n      scooped out on the face” of rocks and monuments found by Mr. Rivett‐\r\n      Carnac “of different sizes varying from six inches to an inch and a‐\r\n      half in diameter, and in depth from one to one and a‐half inch ...\r\n      generally arranged in perpendicular lines presenting many\r\n      permutations in the number and size and arrangement of the cups”—are\r\n      simply _written records_ of the oldest races. Whosoever examines\r\n      with attention the drawings made of such marks in _Archæological\r\n      Notes on Ancient Sculpturing on Rocks in Kumaon, India, etc._, will\r\n      find therein the most primitive style of marking or recording.\r\n      Something of the sort was adopted by the American inventors of the\r\n      Morse code of telegraphic writing, which reminds us of the Ogham\r\n      writing, a combination of long and short strokes, as Mr. Rivett‐\r\n      Carnac describes it, “cut on sandstone.” Sweden, Norway, and\r\n      Scandinavia are full of such _written_ records, for the Runic\r\n      characters follow the cup‐marks and long and short strokes. In\r\n      Johannes Magnus’ Infolio one may see the representation of the demi‐\r\n      god, the giant Starchaterus (Starkad, the pupil of Hroszharsgrani,\r\n      the Magician), holding under each arm a huge stone covered with\r\n      Runic characters. This Starkad, according to Scandinavian legend,\r\n      went to Ireland and performed marvellous deeds in the North and\r\n      South, East and West.

In Perry’s _View of the Levant_ there is a\r\n      figure representing the _south pole_ of the Earth in the\r\n      constellation of the _Harp_, in which the poles appear like two\r\n      _straight rods_ surmounted with hawks’ wings, to distinguish the\r\n      north from the south. But the symbols of the poles ... are,\r\n      sometimes, in the form of serpents, with the heads of hawks to\r\n      distinguish the north from the south end.” (_Op. cit._, p. 41.)\r\n\r\n  803 Faber and Bishop Cumberland would make these all the later pagan\r\n      personifications of “the Noëtic Ark, and ... no other than the\r\n      patriarch [Noah] and his family”(!), as the former writer puts it in\r\n      his _Cabiri_ (i. 136); because, we are told, that most probably\r\n      after the Deluge in commemoration of the event, the pious Noachidæ\r\n      established a religious festival, which was, later on, corrupted by\r\n      their _impious_ descendants, who made of “Noah and his family”\r\n      demons or hero‐gods; “and at length unblushing obscenity usurped the\r\n      name and garb of religion” (_ibid._, i. p. 10). Now this is indeed\r\n      putting an extinguisher upon the human reasoning powers, not only of\r\n      antiquity, but even of our present generations. Reverse the\r\n      statement, and after the words “Noah and his family” explain that\r\n      what was meant is simply the Jewish version of a Samothracian\r\n      mystery, of Saturn, or Cronus‐Cydyk and his Sons, and then we may\r\n      say _Amen_.\r\n\r\n  804 Who were later on, with the Greeks, limited to Castor and Pollux\r\n      only.

He says that the Kabiri named Axieros and\r\n      Axiokersa (_a_) derived their names from _kab_ or _cab_, a\r\n      “measure,” and from _urim_, the “heavens”—the Kabirim being thus “a\r\n      measure of the heavens”; and (_b_) that their distinctive names,\r\n      implying the _principle of generation_, referred to the sexes. For\r\n      “the word _sex_ was formerly understood by _ax_; which ... has, in\r\n      our time, settled into sex. [And he refers to _Encyclopædia\r\n      Londiniensis_, at the word ‘aspiration.’] Now if we give the\r\n      aspirated sound to Axieros, it would become _Sax_ or _Sexieros_; and\r\n      the other pole would be _Sexiokersa_. The two poles would thus\r\n      become the generators of the other powers of nature—they would be\r\n      the _Parents_ of the other powers; therefore, the most powerful\r\n      Gods.” (_Op. cit._, p. 39.)\r\n\r\n  812 ii. 51.\r\n\r\n  813 i. 9‐17.\r\n\r\n  814 Decharme, _Mythologie de la Grèce Antique_, p. 270.\r\n\r\n  815 The word _guebra_ comes from Kabiri (_Gabiri_), and means the\r\n      Persian ancient fire‐worshippers, or Parsîs.

Each King is invariably said to have _seven_\r\n      sons, an allusion to the seven sub‐races. One instance will do. The\r\n      King of Kushā‐Dvîpa had seven sons ... “after whom the seven\r\n      portions or Varsha of the island were called.... _There reside\r\n      mankind, along with Daityas and Dânavas, as well as with spirits of\r\n      heaven_ [_Gandharvas_, _Yakshas_, _Kimpurushas_, etc.] _and Gods._”\r\n      (Wilson’s Trans., ii. 195.) There is but one exception in the case\r\n      of King Priyavrata, the son of the first Manu, Svâyambhuva—who had\r\n      _ten_ sons. But of these, three—Medha, Agnibâhu, and Putra (_ibid._,\r\n      ii. 101)—became ascetics, and refused their portions. Thus\r\n      Priyavrata divided the Earth again into _seven_ continents.\r\n\r\n  836 _Égypte_, pp. 450‐455: De Mirville, _ibid._, pp. 41, 42.\r\n\r\n  837 As a general rule, _now_ that the very nature of the _inner_ man has\r\n      become as blind as his physical nature, man on this Globe is as the\r\n      Amphioxus is in the ocean. Seen by millions of various other fishes\r\n      and creatures that surround it, the Amphioxus species—having neither\r\n      brain nor any of the senses possessed by the other classes—sees them\r\n      not. Who knows whether, on the Darwinian theory, these Branchiostoma\r\n      are not the direct ancestors of our Materialists?\r\n\r\n  838 The Occultists have been accused of worshipping Gods or Devils! We\r\n      deny this. Among the numberless hosts of Spirits—entities that have\r\n      been or that will be men—there are some immeasurably superior to the\r\n      human race, higher and holier than the highest saint on Earth, and\r\n      wiser than any mortal without exception. And there are those again\r\n      who are no better than we are, and some also who are far worse and\r\n      inferior to the lowest savage. It is these last that command the\r\n      readiest communication with our Earth, who perceive and sense us, as\r\n      the clairvoyants perceive and sense them. The close proximity of our\r\n      respective abodes and planes of perception are, unfortunately, in\r\n      favour of such inter‐communication, as they are ever ready to\r\n      interfere with our affairs for weal or woe. If we are asked how it\r\n      is that none but sensitive hysterical natures, neuro‐ and psycho‐\r\n      pathic persons, see—and occasionally talk with—“spirits,” we answer\r\n      the question by several other queries. We ask: Do you know the\r\n      nature of hallucination, and can you define its psychic process? How\r\n      can you tell that all such visions are due merely to physical\r\n      hallucinations? What makes you feel so sure that mental and nervous\r\n      diseases, while drawing a veil over our _normal_ senses (so‐called),\r\n      _do not_ reveal at the same time vistas unknown to the healthy man,\r\n      by throwing open doors usually closed against your scientific (?)\r\n      perceptions; or that a psycho‐spiritual faculty _does not_ forthwith\r\n      replace the loss, or the temporary atrophy, of a purely physical\r\n      sense? It is disease or the exuberance of nervous fluid which\r\n      produces mediumship and visions—hallucinations, as you call them.\r\n      But what _does_ Science know even of mediumship? Truly were the\r\n      modern Charcots to pay attention to the delirium of their patients\r\n      from a more psychic standpoint, Science—Physiology especially—might\r\n      be more benefited than it is now, and truth have a wider field of\r\n      fact in its knowledge.\r\n\r\n  839 i. 70; De Mirville, _ibid._, p. 26.\r\n\r\n  840 These were the early Âryans and the bulk of the Fourth Root‐Race—the\r\n      former pious and meditative (given to yoga‐contemplation), the\r\n      latter a fighting race of sorcerers, who were rapidly degenerating\r\n      owing to their uncontrolled passions.\r\n\r\n  841 The Northern and Southern Divisions of Lemuria‐Atlantis.

Such\r\n      elements, by an Occult process, can be made as impervious to it as\r\n      water to a blow.\r\n\r\n  843 _Ibid._, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n  844 The First Continent, or Island, if so preferred, “the cap of the\r\n      North Pole,” has never perished; nor will it to the end of the Seven\r\n      Races.\r\n\r\n  845 See De Rougemont, _ibid._\r\n\r\n  846 Boulanger, _Règne des Dieux_, Introd.; see De Mirville, _op. cit._,\r\n      _ibid._, pp. 32, 33.\r\n\r\n  847 The Secret Doctrine explains and expounds what Plato says, for it\r\n      teaches that those “Inventors” were Gods and Demi‐gods (Devas and\r\n      Rishis) who had become—some deliberately, some compelled by\r\n      Karma—incarnated in man.\r\n\r\n  848 The preceding paragraphs are condensed from Plato, _Legg._, l.\r\n      iv—_id., in Crit., et in Politic._; De Mirville, _ibid._, pp. 33,\r\n      34.\r\n\r\n  849 Argyle, _Unity of Nature_.\r\n\r\n  850 _Book of the Dead_, xcix. 33; and clvi. 4.

This is a direct reference to the Esoteric division of man’s\r\n      “principles” symbolized by the divine wheat. The legend which\r\n      inscribes the third Register of the papyrus (_Book of the Dead_,\r\n      cx.) states: “This is the region of the Manes [disembodied men]\r\n      _seven_ cubits high—[to wit, those just translated and supposed to\r\n      be still sevenfold with all their ‘principles,’ even the body being\r\n      represented _astrally_ in the Kâma Loka or Hades, before their\r\n      separation]; and there is wheat _three_ cubits high for Mummies in a\r\n      _state of perfection_ [_i.e._, those already separated, whose\r\n      _three_ higher principles are in Devachan] who are permitted to\r\n      glean it.” This region (Devachan) is called “the land of the Re‐\r\n      birth of Gods,” and is shown to be inhabited by Shoo, Tefnoot, and\r\n      Seb. The “region for the Manes _seven_ cubits high”—for the yet\r\n      imperfect Mummies—and the region for those “in a state of\r\n      perfection” who “glean wheat _three_ cubits high,” is as clear as\r\n      possible. The Egyptians had the same Esoteric Philosophy which is\r\n      now taught by the Cis‐Himâlayan Adepts, and the latter, when,\r\n      buried, have corn and wheat placed over them.\r\n\r\n  851 I. xiv. There are Egyptologists who have quite erroneously tried to\r\n      identify Osiris with Menes.

But “Isis‐\r\n      Osiris” reigned in Egypt before the Zodiac was painted on the\r\n      ceiling of the temple of Dendera, and that is over 75,000 years ago!\r\n\r\n  852 In the text, “corked up” or “screwed up.”\r\n\r\n  853 _Zohar_, part i, col. 177; De Mirville, _ibid._, p. 88.\r\n\r\n  854 _Genesis_, vi. 4.\r\n\r\n  855 _Prælectiones Theol._, ch. ii; De Mirville, _ibid._, p. 84.\r\n\r\n  856 _Réflexions Critiques sur l’Origine des Anciens Peuples._\r\n\r\n  857 Rabbi Parcha.\r\n\r\n  858 i. 6.\r\n\r\n  859 _Book of Ruth and Schadash_, fol. 63, col. 3, Amsterdam edition.\r\n\r\n  860 _Zohar_, part ii, col. 73; De Mirville, _ibid._, p. 86.\r\n\r\n  861 _Ibid._, p. 87.\r\n\r\n  862 _More Nevochim_, xxvi. 8.\r\n\r\n  863 _Sagra Scrittura._\r\n\r\n  864 ii. pp. 14, 29.\r\n\r\n  865 Chap. viii; Laurence’s Translation, pp. 7 and 8.\r\n\r\n  866 _Job_, i. 6.\r\n\r\n  867 The Chaldæan _Book of Numbers_.\r\n\r\n  868 _Archæology_, xxv. 220, London.\r\n\r\n  869 _Die Phoinizier_, 70.\r\n\r\n  870 See Sanchuniathon in Eusebius, _Pr.

He is one of the\r\n      seven Rishis; exoterically, the son of Marîchi, the son of Brahmâ;\r\n      while the _Atharva Veda_ says, “The Self‐born Kashyapa sprang from\r\n      Time,” and _Esoterically_ Time and Space are forms of the One\r\n      _incognizable_ Deity. As an Âditya, Indra is son of Kashyapa, as\r\n      also Vaivasvata Manu, our Progenitor. In the instance given in the\r\n      text, he is Kashyapa‐Âditya, the Sun and the Sun‐god, from whom all\r\n      the “Cosmic” Demons, Dragons (Nâgas), Serpent or Snake‐gods, and\r\n      Dânavas or Giants, are born. The meaning of the allegories given\r\n      above is purely astronomical and cosmical, but will serve to prove\r\n      the identity of all.\r\n\r\n  875 _Vishnu Purâna_, Wilson’s Trans., ii. 72.\r\n\r\n  876 All such stories differ in the _exoteric_ texts. In the\r\n      _Mahâbhârata_, Kârttikeya, “the six‐faced Mars,” is the son of Rudra\r\n      or Shiva, Self‐born _without a mother_ from the seed of Shiva cast\r\n      into the fire. But Kârttikeya is generally called Agnibhû, “Fire‐\r\n      born.”\r\n\r\n  877 Hiranyâksha is ruler or king of the _fifth_ region of Pâtâla, a\r\n      Snake‐god.\r\n\r\n  878 The Elohim also feared the Knowledge of Good and Evil for Adam, and\r\n      therefore are shown as expelling him from Eden or killing him\r\n      _spiritually_.\r\n\r\n  879 The story told is, that Târaka (called also Kâlanâbha), owing to his\r\n      extraordinary Yoga‐powers, had obtained all the divine knowledge of\r\n      Yoga‐vidyâ and the Occult powers of the Gods, who conspired against\r\n      him. Here we see the “obedient” Host of Archangels or minor Gods\r\n      conspiring against the (future) Fallen Angels, whom Enoch accuses of\r\n      the great crime of disclosing to the world all “the _secret things_\r\n      done in heaven.” It is Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Suryal and Uriel\r\n      who denounced to the Lord God those of their Brethren who were said\r\n      _to have pried into the divine mysteries_ and taught them to men; by\r\n      this means they themselves escaped a like punishment. Michael was\r\n      commissioned to fight the Dragon, and so was Kârttikeya, and under\r\n      the same circumstances. Both are “Leaders of the Celestial Host,”\r\n      both Virgins, both “Leaders of Saints,” “Spear‐holders” (Shakti‐\r\n      dharas), etc. Kârttikeya is the original of Michael and St. George,\r\n      as surely as Indra is the prototype of Kârttikeya.\r\n\r\n  880 The “life and the light” of the material _physical_ world, the\r\n      delight of the senses—not of the soul. Apollo is preëminently the\r\n      _human_ God, the God of emotional, pomp‐loving and theatrical Church\r\n      ritualism, with lights and music.\r\n\r\n  881 See _Revelation_ (xii) where we find Apollo’s mother persecuted by\r\n      the Python, the Red Dragon, who is also Porphyrion, the scarlet or\r\n      red Titan.\r\n\r\n  882 _Book of God_, p. 88.\r\n\r\n  883 No “God”—whether called Bel or Jehovah—who _curses_ his (supposed)\r\n      own work, because he has made it imperfect, can be the One Infinite\r\n      Absolute Wisdom.\r\n\r\n  884 In the Indian allegory of Târakâmaya, the War between the Gods and\r\n      the Asuras headed by Soma (the Moon, the King of Plants), it is\r\n      Vishvakarmâ, the artificer of the Gods, who, like Vulcan (Tubal‐\r\n      Cain), forges their weapons for them.\r\n\r\n  885 _Chaldean Account of Genesis_, p. 304. We have said elsewhere that\r\n      the “woman with child” of _Revelation_ was Aima, the Great Mother,\r\n      or Binah, the third Sephira, “whose name is Jehovah”; and the\r\n      “Dragon,” who seeks to devour her coming child (the Universe), is\r\n      the Dragon of Absolute Wisdom—that Wisdom which, recognizing the\r\n      non‐separateness of the Universe and everything in it from the\r\n      Absolute ALL, sees in it no better than the great Illusion,\r\n      Mahâmâyâ, hence the cause of misery and suffering.\r\n\r\n  886 The “seven Karshvares of the Earth”—the seven Spheres of our\r\n      Planetary Chain, the seven Worlds, also mentioned in the _Rig Veda_,\r\n      are fully referred to elsewhere. There are six Râjamsi (Worlds)\r\n      above Prithivî, the Earth, or “this” (Idâm), as opposed to that\r\n      which is _yonder_ (the six Globes on the three other planes). (See\r\n      _Rig Veda_, i. 34; iii. 56; vii. 10411, and v. 60, 6.)\r\n\r\n  887 Darmesteter’s Trans., “Sacred Books of the East,” vol. iv. p. 207.\r\n\r\n  888 _Ibid._, p. 217.\r\n\r\n  889 _Ibid._, p. 208.\r\n\r\n  890 _Book of the Dead_, xvii. 62; Anubis is Horus who melts “in him who\r\n      is eyeless.”\r\n\r\n  891 See Lenoir’s _Du Dragon de Metz_.\r\n\r\n  892 See also _Egyptian Pantheon_, pp. 20, 23.\r\n\r\n  893 _Book of the Dead_, xvii. 54 and 49.\r\n\r\n  894 These “Evil Spirits” can by no means be identified with Satan or the\r\n      Great Dragon. They are the Elementals generated or begotten by\r\n      ignorance—cosmic and human passions—or Chaos.\r\n\r\n  895 _Assyrian Discoveries_, p. 403.\r\n\r\n  896 See _Numbers_, xxi. 8, 9. God orders Moses to build a brazen Serpent\r\n      (Saraph), to _look upon_ which heals those bitten by the Fiery\r\n      Serpents. The latter were the Seraphim, each one of which, as Isaiah\r\n      shows (vi. 2), “had six wings”; they are the symbols of Jehovah, and\r\n      of all the other Demiurgi who produce out of themselves six sons or\r\n      likenesses—seven with their Creator. Thus, the Brazen Serpent _is_\r\n      Jehovah, the chief of the “Fiery Serpents.” And yet, in _II Kings_\r\n      (xviii. 4) it is shown that king Hezekiah, who, like as David his\r\n      father, “did that which was right in the sight of the Lord”—“brake\r\n      in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made ... and called it\r\n      Nehushtan,” or piece of brass.\r\n\r\n  897 “And Satan stood up against Israel and provoked David to number\r\n      Israel” (_I Chronicles_, xxi. 1). “The anger of the Lord [Jehovah]\r\n      was kindled against Israel, and he moved David ... to say, Go,\r\n      number Israel” (_II Samuel_, xxiv. 1). The two are then identical.\r\n\r\n  898 ii. 18, 22.\r\n\r\n  899 Dozens of the most erudite writers have sifted thoroughly the\r\n      various meanings of the name J’hovah (with, and without the\r\n      Masoretic points), and shown their multifarious bearings. The best\r\n      of such works is the _Source of Measures: the Hebrew Egyptian\r\n      Mystery_, by J. Ralston Skinner, so often already referred to.\r\n\r\n  900 In the above‐mentioned work (p. 233), verse 26 of chapter iv of\r\n      _Genesis_ is correctly translated “then men began to call\r\n      _themselves_ Jehovah,” but less correctly explained, perhaps, as the\r\n      last word ought to be written Jah (male) Hovah (female), to show\r\n      that from that time the race of distinctly separate man and woman\r\n      began.\r\n\r\n  901 See for explanation the excellent pages of Appendix vii of the same\r\n      work.\r\n\r\n  902 _Op. cit._, p. 293.\r\n\r\n  903 _Rabba Battra_, 16a.\r\n\r\n  904 In Demonology, Satan is the leader of the opposition in Hell, the\r\n      monarch of which was Beelzebub. He belongs to the fifth kind or\r\n      class of Demons (of which there are nine according to mediæval\r\n      Demonology), and he is at the head of witches and sorcerers. But see\r\n      elsewhere the true meaning of Baphomet, the goat‐headed Satan, one\r\n      with Azazel, the scape‐goat of Israel. Nature is the God Pan.\r\n\r\n  905 See _Isis Unveiled_, ii. 184.\r\n\r\n  906 See _Codex Nazaræus_, iii. 73.\r\n\r\n  907 He is also Vulcan or Vul‐cain, the greatest God with the later\r\n      Egyptians, and the greatest Kabir. The God of Time was Chiun in\r\n      Egypt, or Saturn, or Seth, and Chiun is the same as Cain. (_Source\r\n      of Measures_, p. 278.)\r\n\r\n  908 See Strabo, comparing them to the Cyclopes, xiv. p. 653 _sqq._\r\n      Callim., _in Del._, 31. Stat., _Silv._, iv. 6, 47, etc.\r\n\r\n  909 _Mythologie de la Grèce Antique_, p. 271.\r\n\r\n  910 Nothing could be more awkward and childish, we say, than this\r\n      fruitless attempt to disconnect the genealogies of Cain and of Seth,\r\n      or to conceal the identity of names under a different spelling.\r\n      Thus, Cain has a Son Enoch, and Seth a Son Enoch (also Enos,\r\n      Ch’anoch, Hanoch—one may do what one likes with unvowelled Hebrew\r\n      names). In the Cainite line Enoch begets Irad, Irad Mehujael, the\r\n      latter Methusael, and Methusael, Lamech. In the Sethite line, Enoch\r\n      begets Cainan, and this one Mahalaleel (a variation on Mehujael),\r\n      who gives birth to Jared (or Irad); Jared to Enoch (number 3), who\r\n      produces Methuselah (from Methusael), and finally Lamech closes the\r\n      list. (See _Genesis_, iv. v.) Now all these are symbols\r\n      (kabalistically) of solar and lunar years, of astronomical periods\r\n      and of physiological (phallic) functions, just as in any other Pagan\r\n      symbolical creed. This has been proven by a number of writers.\r\n\r\n  911 See _Analysis of Ancient Mythology_, ii. 760.\r\n\r\n  912 vi. 9.\r\n\r\n  913 See _New Encyclopædia_, by Abraham Rees, F.R.S.\r\n\r\n  914 See _Hebrews_, v. 6; vii. 1, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n  915 The Æolian name of Mars was Areus (Ἄρευς), and the Greek Ares (Ἄρης)\r\n      is a name over the etymological significance of which, Philologists\r\n      and Indianists, Greek and Sanskrit scholars, have vainly worked to\r\n      this day. Very strangely, Max Müller connects both the names Mars\r\n      and Ares with the Sanskrit root _mar_, whence he traces their\r\n      derivation, and from which, he says, comes the name of the Maruts or\r\n      Storm‐gods. Welcker, however, offers a more correct etymology. (See\r\n      _Griech. Götterlehre_, i. 415.) However it may be, etymologies of\r\n      roots and words alone will never yield the Esoteric meaning fully,\r\n      though they may help to useful guesses.\r\n\r\n  916 As the same author shows: “The very name Vulcain appears in the\r\n      reading, for in the first words (_Gen._, iv. 5) is to be found\r\n      V’elcain, or V’ulcain, agreeably to the deepened _u_ sound of the\r\n      letter _vau_. Out of its immediate context, it may be read as, ‘_and\r\n      the god Cain_,’ or Vulcain. If, however, anything is wanting to\r\n      confirm the Cain‐Vulcain idea, Fuerst says: ‘קין _Cain, the iron\r\n      point of a lance, a smith_ (blacksmith), inventor of sharp iron\r\n      tools and smith work’ ” (p. 278).\r\n\r\n  917 _Op. cit._, p. 186.\r\n\r\n  918 _Append. de Cabiris ap. Orig. Gent._, pp. 364, 376; and the latter\r\n      statement on p. 357. See Faber’s _Cabiri_, i. 8.\r\n\r\n  919 Some derive the word from Paras which produced Pars, Pers, Persia;\r\n      but it may be equally derived from Pitaras or Pitris, the Hindû\r\n      progenitors of the Fifth Race—the Fathers of Wisdom or the Sons of\r\n      “Will and Yoga”—who were called Pitaras, as were the divine Pitris\r\n      of the First Race.\r\n\r\n  920 See for these traditions the _Collection of Persian Legends_, in\r\n      Russian, Georgian, Armenian, and Persian; Herbelot’s narrative\r\n      _Légendes Persanes_, “Bibliothèque Orientale,” p. 298, 387, etc.,\r\n      and Danville’s _Mémoires_. We give in a condensed narrative that\r\n      which is scattered in hundreds of volumes in European and Asiatic\r\n      languages, as well as in oral traditions.\r\n\r\n  921 _Genesis_, iv. 16, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n  922 The _main_ Continent perished in the Miocene times, as already\r\n      stated.\r\n\r\n  923 From Bede downwards all the chronologists of the Church have\r\n      differed among themselves, and contradicted each other. “The\r\n      chronology of the Hebrew text has been grossly altered, especially\r\n      in the interval next after the Deluge”—says Whiston (_Old Test._, p.\r\n      20).\r\n\r\n  924 ii. 170, 171.\r\n\r\n  925 Hence king Solomon, whose traces are nowhere to be found outside of\r\n      the _Bible_. The description of his magnificent palace and city\r\n      dovetail with those of the Persian tales, though they were unknown\r\n      to all Pagan travellers, even to Herodotus.\r\n\r\n  926 Herbelot, _op. cit._, p. 829.\r\n\r\n  927 _Orient. Trad._, p. 454. See also Bailly’s _Lettres sur\r\n      l’Atlantide_.\r\n\r\n  928 See _Orient. Collect._, ii. 119.\r\n\r\n  929 _Ibid._ Remember that the Rabbins teach that there are to be seven\r\n      successive renewals of the Globe; that each will last 7,000 years,\r\n      the total duration being thus 49,000 years. (See Rabbi Parcha’s\r\n      _Wheel_; also Kenealy’s _Book of God_, p. 176.) This refers to seven\r\n      Rounds, seven Root‐Races, and sub‐races, the truly Occult figures,\r\n      though sorely confused.\r\n\r\n  930 _Tales of Derbent._\r\n\r\n  931 Mergain, or Morgana, the fairy sister of King Arthur, is thus shown\r\n      of Oriental descent.\r\n\r\n  932 Where we find her, indeed, in Great Britain, in the romance of the\r\n      Knights of the Round Table. Whence the identity of name and fairy‐\r\n      hood, if both heroines did not symbolize the same historical event\r\n      which passed into a legend?\r\n\r\n  933 Herbelot, p. 593; _Armenian Tales_, p. 35.\r\n\r\n  934 To this day the aborigines of Caucasus speak of their mountains as\r\n      Kap‐kaz, using the consonant _p_ instead of the usual _v_ (Kav‐kaz\r\n      or Caucasus). But their bards say that it requires seven months for\r\n      a swift horse to reach the “dry land” beyond Kaf, holding North\r\n      without ever deviating from one’s way.\r\n\r\n  935 Bailly thought he saw in this Horse a twelve‐oared ship. The Secret\r\n      Doctrine teaches that the early Third Race built boats and flotillas\r\n      before it built houses. But the “Horse,” though a much later animal,\r\n      has, nevertheless, a more occult primitive meaning. The crocodile\r\n      and the hippopotamus were considered sacred and represented divine\r\n      symbols, both with the ancient Egyptians and with the Mexicans.\r\n      Poseidon is, in Homer, the God of the Horse, and assumes that form\r\n      himself to please Ceres. Arion, their progeny, is one of the aspects\r\n      of that “Horse,” which is a Cycle.\r\n\r\n  936 The severed parts must be Norway and other lands in the\r\n      neighbourhood of the Arctic Circle.\r\n\r\n  937 Cosmas Indicopleustes in _Collect. Novâ Patrum_, t. ii. p. 188; also\r\n      see _Journ. des Savants_, Suppl. 1707, p. 20.\r\n\r\n  938 The two Poles are called the “right” and “left ends” of our\r\n      Globe—the Right being the North Pole—or the head and feet of the\r\n      Earth. Every beneficent (astral and cosmic) action comes from the\r\n      North; every lethal influence from the South Pole. They are much\r\n      connected with and influence “right” and “left” hand magic.\r\n\r\n  939 The more one approaches the Poles the less rotation is felt; at the\r\n      Poles proper, the diurnal revolution is quite neutralized. Hence the\r\n      expression that the Sphere is “motionless.”\r\n\r\n  940 It is averred in Occultism that the land or island, which crowns the\r\n      North Pole like a skull‐cap, is the only one which prevails during\r\n      the whole Manvantara of our Round. All the central continents and\r\n      lands will emerge from the sea bottom many times in turn, but this\r\n      land will never change.\r\n\r\n  941 Bear in mind that the Vedic and Avestaic name of Fohat is Apâm‐\r\n      Napât. In the _Avesta_ he stands between the Fire‐yazatas and the\r\n      Water‐yazatas. The literal meaning is “Son of the Waters,” but these\r\n      “Waters” are not the liquid we know, but Æther—the Fiery Waters of\r\n      Space. Fohat is the “Son of Æther” in its highest aspect, Âkâsha,\r\n      the Mother‐Father of the primitive Seven, and of Sound or the Logos.\r\n      Fohat is the Light of the Logos.\r\n\r\n  942 This “Water” is the blood or fluid of Life which animates the Earth,\r\n      compared here to a living body.\r\n\r\n  943 Occult teaching corroborates the popular tradition which asserts the\r\n      existence of a Fountain of Life in the bowels of the Earth and in\r\n      the North Pole. It is the blood of the Earth, the electro‐magnetic\r\n      current, which circulates through all the arteries, and which is\r\n      said to be found stored in the “navel” of the Earth.\r\n\r\n  944 Occultism points to the Himâlayan Chain as that “belt,” and\r\n      maintains that whether under the water or above, it encircles the\r\n      Globe. The “navel” is described as situated towards the setting Sun\r\n      or to the West of the Himavat in which lie the roots of Meru, which\r\n      mountain is North of the Himâlaya. Meru is _not_ “the fabulous\r\n      mountain _in_ the navel or centre of the earth,” but its roots and\r\n      foundations are in that “navel,” while it is in the far North\r\n      itself. This connects it with the “Central” Land “that never\r\n      perishes”; the land in which “the day of the mortal lasts six months\r\n      and his night another six months.” As the _Vishnu Purâna_ has it:\r\n      “For the North of Meru there is, therefore, always night during day\r\n      in _other regions_; for Meru is North of all the Dvipas and Varshas”\r\n      (islands and countries). (Book ii. chap. viii.) Meru is therefore\r\n      neither on Atlas as Wilford suggests, nor, as Wilson tried to show,\r\n      “absolutely in the centre of the globe,” only because “relatively\r\n      with the inhabitants of the several portions, to all of whom the\r\n      East is that quarter where the sun first appears.”\r\n\r\n  945 Even the Commentaries do not refrain from Oriental metaphor. The\r\n      Globe is likened to the body of a woman, “Mother‐Earth.” From her\r\n      neck downward, means from the inland sea now beyond the impassable\r\n      barrier of ice. The Earth, as Parâshara says, “is the mother and\r\n      nurse, augmented with all creatures and their qualities, the\r\n      _comprehender_ of all the worlds.”\r\n\r\n  946 For the Stanzas call this locality by a term translated in the\r\n      Commentary as _a place of no latitude_ (Niraksha), the Abode of the\r\n      Gods. As a scholiast says in the _Sûrya Siddhânta_ (xii. 42‐44):\r\n\r\n      “Above them goes the sun when situated at the equinoxes; they have\r\n      neither equinoctial shadow nor elevation of the pole (_akshonnati_).\r\n\r\n      “In both directions from Meru are two pole‐stars (_dhruvatârâ_),\r\n      fixed in the midst of the sky, to those _who are situated in places\r\n      of no latitude_ (_niraksha_), both these have their place in the\r\n      horizon.\r\n\r\n      “Hence there is, in those cities [in that land], no elevation of the\r\n      poles, the two pole‐stars being situated in their horizon; but their\r\n      degrees of co‐latitude (_lambaka_) are ninety: at Meru the degrees\r\n      of latitude (_aksha_) are of the same number.” (See _Vishnu Purâna_,\r\n      Wilson’s Trans., ii. 208.)\r\n\r\n  947 Wilford makes many mistakes. He identifies, for instance, Shveta‐\r\n      dvîpa, the White Island, the “island in the northern part of\r\n      Toyambhudi,” with England, and then tries to identify it with Atala.\r\n      (a nether region) and Atlantis. Now the Shveta‐dvîpa is the abode of\r\n      Vishnu (exoterically), and Atala is a hell. He also places it in the\r\n      Euxine or Ikshu (Black) Sea, and then seems to connect it, in\r\n      another place, with Africa and Atlas.\r\n\r\n  948 _Asiatick Researches_, viii. 280.\r\n\r\n  949 _Op. cit._, _ibid._, p. 201.\r\n\r\n  950 Every name in the _Purânas_ has to be examined at least under two\r\n      aspects, geographically and metaphysically, in its allegorical\r\n      application; _e.g._, Nîla, the (blue) mountain which is one of the\r\n      boundaries to the north of Meru, is again to be sought\r\n      geographically in a mountain range in Orissa, and yet again in a\r\n      mountain quite different from the others, in Western Africa. Jambu‐\r\n      dvîpa is Vishnu’s dominion—the World, limited in the _Purânas_ to\r\n      our Globe, the region which contains Meru _only_, and again it is\r\n      divided to contain Bharata‐varsha (India), its _best_ division, and\r\n      the fairest, says Parâshara. Likewise with Pushkara and all others.\r\n\r\n  951 _Ibid._, p. 202.\r\n\r\n  952 _Sûrya Siddhânta_, Whitney’s Trans., v. 5.\r\n\r\n  953 _Asiatick Researches_, iii. 300.\r\n\r\n  954 Jambu, Plaksha, Shâlmali, Kusha, Krauncha, Shâka, and Pushkara.\r\n\r\n  955 Such as Shâka and Pushkara, for instance, which do not yet exist,\r\n      but into which will enter such lands as some portions of America, of\r\n      Africa, and Central Asia, with the Gobi region. Let us bear in mind\r\n      that Upadvîpas mean “root” islands, or the dry land in general.\r\n\r\n  956 They were called Demons, Asuras, Giants, and monsters, because of\r\n      their wickedness; and thus their country was likened to Atala—a\r\n      Hell.\r\n\r\n  957 Not on the river Nile, surely, but near the Nila mountains of the\r\n      Atlas range.\r\n\r\n  958 _Asiatick Researches_, iii. 225.\r\n\r\n  959 See vols. viii, x, and xi, of _Asiatick Researches_.\r\n\r\n  960 _Op. cit._, iii. 326.\r\n\r\n  961 _Ibid._\r\n\r\n  962 Says Wilford of the division of Atlantis and Bhârata or India,\r\n      confusing the two accounts and Priyavrata with Medhâtithi: “This\r\n      division was made by Priyavrata.... He had ten sons, and it was his\r\n      intention to divide the whole world between them equally.... In the\r\n      same manner Neptune divided the Atlantis between his ten sons: one\r\n      of them had ... the extremity of the Atlantis”—which “is probably\r\n      the old continent, at the extremity of which is Gades.... This\r\n      Atlantis was overwhelmed with a flood; and it seems that _by the\r\n      Atlantis, we should understand the antediluvian Earth_, over which\r\n      ten princes were born to rule, according to the mythology of the\r\n      West [and of the East, also] but _seven_ of them only sate upon the\r\n      throne.” (_Op. cit._, viii. 286.) Some also are of opinion that of\r\n      the seven Dvîpas _six_ were destroyed by a flood. Wilford takes it\r\n      to be “Gades which included Spain,” but it was Plato’s\r\n      island—rather.\r\n\r\n  963 America, the “new” world, is thus, though not _much_, older—still it\r\n      _is_ older—than Europe, the “old” world.\r\n\r\n  964 If Div or Dev‐sefid’s (the Târadaitya’s) abode was on the _seventh\r\n      stage_, it is because he came from Pushkara, the Pâtâla (antipodes)\r\n      of India, or from America. The latter touched the walls, so to say,\r\n      of Atlantis, before the latter finally sank. The word Pâtâla meaning\r\n      both the antipodal countries and infernal regions, these became\r\n      synonymous in ideas and attributes as well as in name.\r\n\r\n  965 Neither Atlantis, nor yet Shankha‐dvîpa, was ever called “White\r\n      Island.” When tradition says that “the White Island became black on\r\n      account of the sins of the people,” it only means the denizens of\r\n      the “White Island,” or Siddhapura, or Shveta‐dvîpa, who descended to\r\n      the Atlantis of the Third and Fourth Races, to “inform the latter;\r\n      and who, having incarnated, became black with sin” figure of speech.\r\n      All the Avatâras of Vishnu are said to come originally from the\r\n      White Island. According to Tibetan tradition the White Island is the\r\n      only locality which escapes the general fate of other Dvipas; it can\r\n      be destroyed by neither fire nor water, for—it is the “Eternal\r\n      Land.”\r\n\r\n  966 _Asiatick Researches_, xi. 27.\r\n\r\n  967 _Genesis_, ix. 1.\r\n\r\n  968 How wise and grand, how far‐seeing and morally beneficent are the\r\n      laws of Manu on connubial life, when compared with the licence\r\n      tacitly allowed to man in civilized countries. That those laws have\r\n      been neglected for the last two millenniums does not prevent us from\r\n      admiring their forethought. The Brâhman was a Grihasta, a family\r\n      man, till a certain period of his life, when, after begetting a son,\r\n      he broke with married life and became a chaste Yogi. His very\r\n      connubial life was regulated by his Brâhman astrologer in accordance\r\n      with his nature. Therefore, in such countries as the Punjâb, for\r\n      instance, where the lethal influence of Mussulman, and later on of\r\n      European, licentiousness, has hardly touched the orthodox Âryan\r\n      castes, one still finds the finest men—so far as stature and\r\n      physical strength go—on the whole Globe; whereas the mighty men of\r\n      old have found themselves replaced in the Deccan, and especially in\r\n      Bengal, by men whose generation becomes with every century—and\r\n      almost with every year—dwarfed and weakened.\r\n\r\n  969 Diseases and over‐population are facts that can never be denied.\r\n\r\n  970 In Mrs. Anna Swanwick’s volume, _The Dramas of Æschylus_, it is said\r\n      of “Prometheus Bound” (“Bohn’s Classical Library,” p. 334), that\r\n      Prometheus truly appears in it “as the champion and benefactor of\r\n      mankind, whose condition: ... is depicted as weak and miserable in\r\n      the extreme.... Zeus, it is said, proposed to annihilate these puny\r\n      ephemerals, and to plant upon the earth a new race in their stead.”\r\n      We see the Lords of Being doing likewise, and exterminating the\r\n      first product of Nature and the Sea, in the Stanzas. “Prometheus\r\n      _represents_ himself as having frustrated this design, and as being\r\n      consequently subjected, for the sake of mortals, to the most\r\n      agonizing pain, inflicted by the remorseless cruelty of Zeus. We\r\n      have, thus, the Titan, the symbol of finite reason and free will [of\r\n      intellectual humanity, or the higher aspect of Manas], depicted _as\r\n      the sublime philanthropist_, while Zeus, the Supreme Deity of\r\n      Hellas, is portrayed as the cruel and obdurate despot, a character\r\n      peculiarly revolting to Athenian sentiment.” The reason for it is\r\n      explained further on. The “Supreme Deity” bears, in every ancient\r\n      Pantheon—including that of the Jews—a _dual_ character, composed of\r\n      light and shadow.\r\n\r\n  971 The animal world, having simple instinct to guide it, has its\r\n      _seasons of procreation_, and the sexes become neutralized during\r\n      the rest of the year. Therefore, the free animal knows sickness but\r\n      once in its life—before it dies.\r\n\r\n  972 Introduction to “Prometheus Bound,” p. 340.\r\n\r\n  973 From προ‐μῆτις, “forethought.” “Professor Kuhn,” we are told in the\r\n      above‐named volumes, _The Dramas of Æschylus_, “considers the name\r\n      of the Titan to be derived from the Sanskrit word Pramantha, the\r\n      instrument used for kindling fire. The root _mand_ or _manth_,\r\n      implies rotatory motion, and the word _manthâmi_, used to denote the\r\n      process of fire kindling, acquired the secondary sense of snatching\r\n      away; hence we find another word of the same stock, _pramatha_,\r\n      signifying theft.” This is very ingenious, but perhaps not\r\n      altogether correct; besides, there is a very prosaic element in it.\r\n      No doubt in physical nature, the higher forms may develop from the\r\n      lower ones, but it is hardly so in the world of thought. And as we\r\n      are told that the word _manthâmi_ passed into the Greek language and\r\n      became the word _manthanô_, to learn—that is to say, to appropriate\r\n      knowledge, whence _prometheia_, fore‐knowledge, fore‐thought—we may\r\n      find, in searching, a more poetical origin for the “fire‐bringer”\r\n      than that displayed in its Sanskrit origin. The Svastica, the sacred\r\n      sign and the instrument for kindling _sacred_ fire, may explain it\r\n      better. “Prometheus, the fire‐bringer, is the Pramantha\r\n      personified,” continues the author, “and finds his prototype in the\r\n      Âryan Mâtarishvan, a divine ... personage, closely associated with\r\n      Agni, the fire‐god of the Vedas.” Matih, in Sanskrit, is\r\n      “understanding,” and a synonym of Mahat and Manas, and must be of\r\n      some account in the origin of the name; Pramatih is the son of\r\n      Fohat, and has his story also.\r\n\r\n  974 Cronus is “Time,” and thus the allegory becomes very suggestive.\r\n\r\n  975 It is complained by the author of the version and translator of\r\n      “Prometheus Bound” that in this tracing of Io’s wanderings, “no\r\n      consistency with our own known geography is attainable” (p. 379).\r\n      There may be good reason for it. First of all it is the journey and\r\n      wandering from place to place of the _Race_ from which the “tenth,”\r\n      or Kalki Avatâra, so called, is to issue. This he calls the “kingly\r\n      race born in _Argos_” (888). But Argos has no reference here to\r\n      Argos in Greece. It comes from _arg_ or _arka_—the female generative\r\n      power symbolized in the Moon—the navi‐formed Argha of the Mysteries,\r\n      meaning the Queen of Heaven. Eustathius shows that, in the dialect\r\n      of the Arg‐ians, Io signified the Moon; while Esotericism explains\r\n      it as the divine Androgyne, or the mystic Ten (10); in Hebrew 10 is\r\n      the perfect number, or Jehovah. Arghya in Sanskrit is the libation\r\n      cup, the navi‐form or boat‐shaped vessel in which flowers and fruit\r\n      are offered to the Deities. Arghyanâth is a title of the Mahâ\r\n      Chohan, meaning the “Lord of Libations”; and Arghyavarsha, the “Land\r\n      of Libations,” is the mystery name of that region which extends from\r\n      Kailâsa mountain nearly to the Shamo Desert—from within which the\r\n      Kalki Avatâra is expected. The Airyâna‐Varsedya of the Zoroastrians,\r\n      as a locality, is identical with it. It is now said to have been\r\n      situated between the Sea of Aral, Baltistan, and Little Tibet; but\r\n      in olden times its area was far larger, as it was the birth‐place of\r\n      _physical_ humanity, of which Io is the mother and symbol.\r\n\r\n  976 _Op. cit._, p. 385, note.\r\n\r\n  977 i. 569, 570.\r\n\r\n  978 Alexander, who was better acquainted with Attock than with India—for\r\n      he never entered India proper—could not have failed to hear the\r\n      Indus, near its very sources, called Nîl and Nîlâ. The mistake—if\r\n      mistake it is—is thus easily accounted for.\r\n\r\n  979 That Io is identical, allegorically, with Isis and the Moon is shown\r\n      by her being “cow‐horned.” The allegory undeniably reached Greece\r\n      from India, where Vâch—the “melodious Cow” of the _Rig Veda_, “from\r\n      whom mankind was produced” (_Bhâgavata Purâna_) is shown in the\r\n      _Aitareya Brâhmana_ as pursued by her father Brahmâ, who was moved\r\n      by an illicit passion, and changed her into a Deer. Hence Io,\r\n      refusing to yield to Jupiter’s passion, becomes “horned.” The Cow\r\n      was in every country the symbol of the passive generative power of\r\n      nature, Isis, Vâch, Venus—the mother of the prolific God of Love,\r\n      Cupid, but, at the same time, that of the Logos whose symbol, with\r\n      the Egyptians and the Indians, became the Bull, as testified to by\r\n      the Apis and the Hindû Bulls in the most ancient temples. In\r\n      Esoteric Philosophy the Cow is the symbol of Creative Nature, and\r\n      the Bull (her calf) the Spirit which vivifies her, or the “Holy\r\n      Spirit,” as Dr. Kenealy shows. Hence the symbol of the horns. These\r\n      were sacred also with the Jews, who placed on the altar horns of\r\n      Shittim wood, by seizing which a criminal ensured his safety.\r\n\r\n  980 _Tuscul. Quæst._, I. ii. 20.\r\n\r\n  981 _Strom._, I. ii, _Oper._, i. 467, Ed. Potter’s.\r\n\r\n  982 Herodotus and Pausanias supposed that the cause of the condemnation\r\n      was that Æschylus, adopting the Theogony of the Egyptians, made\r\n      Diana the daughter of Ceres, and not of Latona. (See Ælian, _Var.\r\n      Hist._, I. v. xviii; i. 433, Edition Gronov.) But Æschylus _was_\r\n      initiated.\r\n\r\n  983 The Sabasia was a periodical festival with Mysteries enacted in\r\n      honour of some Gods, a variant on the Mithraic Mysteries. The whole\r\n      evolution of the Races was performed in these Mysteries.\r\n\r\n  984 Mrs. A. Swanwick, _op. cit._\r\n\r\n  985 See the foot‐note (p. 431) concerning the etymology of προ‐μῆτις or\r\n      _forethought_. Prometheus confesses it in the drama when saying:\r\n\r\n      O holy ether, swiftly‐wingèd gales....\r\n      Behold what I, a god, from gods endure.\r\n\r\n      And yet what say I? _Clearly I foreknow_\r\n      All that must happen....\r\n      ... The Destined it behoves,\r\n      As best I may, to bear, for well I wot\r\n      How incontestable the strength of Fate.... (105)\r\n\r\n      “Fate” stands here for Karma, or Nemesis.\r\n\r\n  986 Mankind is obviously divided into God‐informed men and lower human\r\n      creatures. The intellectual difference between the Âryan and other\r\n      civilized nations and such savages as the South Sea Islanders, is\r\n      inexplicable on any other grounds. No amount of culture, no\r\n      generations of training amid civilization, could raise such human\r\n      specimens as the Bushmen, the Veddhas of Ceylon, and some African\r\n      tribes, to the same intellectual level as the Âryans, the Semites,\r\n      and the Turanians so‐called. The “Sacred Spark” is missing in them,\r\n      and it is they who are the only _inferior_ races on the Globe, now\r\n      happily—owing to the wise adjustment of Nature which ever works in\r\n      that direction—fast dying out. Verily mankind is “of one blood,”\r\n      _but not of the same essence_. We are the hot‐house, artificially\r\n      quickened plants in Nature, having in us a spark, which in them is\r\n      latent.\r\n\r\n  987 The philosophical view of Indian metaphysics places the Root of Evil\r\n      in the differentiation of the Homogeneous into the Heterogeneous, of\r\n      the Unit into Plurality.\r\n\r\n  988 _Sap._, i. 13.\r\n\r\n  989 Gautama Buddha, named Shâkya Thüb‐pa, is the _twenty‐seventh_ of the\r\n      last group, as most of these Buddhas belong to the Divine Dynasties\r\n      which instructed mankind.\r\n\r\n  990 Of these Buddhas, or the “Enlightened,” the far distant predecessors\r\n      of Gautama, the Buddha, who represent, we are taught, once living?\r\n      men, great Adepts and Saints, in whom the “Sons of Wisdom” had\r\n      incarnated, and who were, therefore, so to speak, minor Avatâras of\r\n      the Celestial Beings—eleven only belong to the Atlantean Race, and\r\n      twenty‐four to the Fifth Race, from its beginnings. They are\r\n      identical with the Tirthankaras of the Jainas.\r\n\r\n  991 This may account for the similarity of the artificial mounds in the\r\n      United States of America, and the tumuli in Norway. It is this\r\n      identity that has led some American Archæologists to suggest that\r\n      Norwegian mariners had _discovered_ America about one thousand years\r\n      ago. (See Holmboe’s _Traces de Bouddhisme en Norvège_, p. 23.) There\r\n      is no doubt that America is that “far distant land into which pious\r\n      men and heavy storms had transferred the sacred doctrine,” as a\r\n      Chinese writer suggested by his description to Neumann. But neither\r\n      Professor Holmboe, of Stockholm, nor the American Archæologists,\r\n      have guessed the right age of the mounds, or the tumuli. The fact\r\n      that Norwegians may have re‐discovered the land that their long‐\r\n      forgotten forefathers believed to have perished in the general\r\n      submersion, does not conflict with the other fact that the Secret\r\n      Doctrine of the land which was the cradle of physical man, and of\r\n      the Fifth Race, had found its way into the so‐called New World ages\r\n      and ages before the “Sacred Doctrine” of Buddhism.\r\n\r\n  992 See _Physiological Selection_, by G. J. Romanes, F.R.S.\r\n\r\n  993 _Esoteric Buddhism_, p. 65.\r\n\r\n  994 _Exodus_, xi.\r\n\r\n  995 Wrote the late Brahmachârî Bawa, a Yogî of great renown and\r\n      holiness: “Extensive works on ‘Ashtar Vidiâ’ and such other sciences\r\n      were at different times compiled in the languages of the times from\r\n      the Sanskrit originals. But they, together with the Sanskrit\r\n      originals, were lost at the time of the partial deluge of our\r\n      county.” (The _Theosophist_, June, 1880, “Some Things the Âryans\r\n      Knew.”) For Agnyastra, see Wilson’s _Specimens of the Hindû\r\n      Theatre_, i. 297.\r\n\r\n  996 Some wonderful, artificially‐made beast, similar in some way to\r\n      Frankenstein’s creation, which spoke and warned his master of every\r\n      approaching danger. The master was a “Black Magician,” the\r\n      mechanical animal was informed by a Djin, an Elemental, according to\r\n      the accounts. The blood of a pure man alone could destroy him.

It is as though one said\r\n      “Asiatics.” Many, multityped, and various were the Atlanteans, who\r\n      represented several “humanities,” and almost a countless number of\r\n      races and nations, more varied indeed than would be the “Europeans,”\r\n      were this name to be given indiscriminately to the five existing\r\n      parts of the world, which, at the rate colonization is proceeding,\r\n      will be the case, perhaps, in less than two or three hundred years.\r\n      There were brown, red, yellow, white and black Atlanteans; giants\r\n      and dwarfs, as some African tribes comparatively are, even now.\r\n\r\n 1008 Says a teacher in _Esoteric Buddhism_ (p. 64): “In the Eocene age,\r\n      even in its very first part, the great cycle of the Fourth Race men,\r\n      the [Lemuro‐] Atlanteans, had already reached its highest point [of\r\n      civilization], and the great Continent, the father of nearly all the\r\n      present continents, showed the first symptoms of sinking.” And on\r\n      page 70, it is shown that Atlantis as a whole perished during the\r\n      Miocene period. To show how the continents, races, nations and\r\n      cycles overlap each other, one has but to think of Lemuria, the last\r\n      of whose lands perished about 700,000 years before the beginning of\r\n      the Tertiary period (p. 65), and the last of “Atlantis” only 11,000\r\n      years ago; thus both overlapping—one the Atlantean period, and the\r\n      other the Âryan.\r\n\r\n 1009 See _Traité de l’Astronomie Indienne et Orientale_, part iii.\r\n\r\n 1010 Ceylon.\r\n\r\n 1011 This is not so. The forefathers of the Âryan Brâhmans had their\r\n      Zodiac and Zodiacal calculations from those born by Kriyâshakti\r\n      power, the “Sons of Yoga”; the Egyptians from the Atlanteans of\r\n      Ruta.\r\n\r\n 1012 The former, therefore, may have registered time for seven or eight\r\n      millions of years, but the Egyptians _could not_.\r\n\r\n 1013 _Op. cit._, p. 6.\r\n\r\n 1014 This question was amply challenged, and as amply discussed and\r\n      answered. See _Five Years of Theosophy_, Art., “Mr. Sinnett’s\r\n      _Esoteric Buddhism_,” pp. 325‐346.\r\n\r\n 1015 _Ruins of Empires_, p. 360. Volney says that, as Aries was in its\r\n      15th degree 1,447 B.C., it follows that the first degree of Libra\r\n      could not have coincided with the Vernal Equinox more lately than\r\n      15,194 years B.C., to which if you add 1,790 since Christ, when\r\n      Volney wrote this, it appears that 16,984 years have elapsed since\r\n      the (Greek or rather Hellenic) origin of the Zodiac.\r\n\r\n 1016 The word “historical” is used, because, although historians have\r\n      almost absurdly dwarfed the dates that separate certain events from\r\n      our modern day, nevertheless, once that they are known and accepted,\r\n      they belong to history. Thus, the Trojan War _is_ a historical\r\n      event, which, though even less than 1,000 years B.C. are assigned to\r\n      it, really took place more nearly 6,000 than 5,000 years B.C.\r\n\r\n 1017 It is a historical fact that Sanchuniathon compiled the full record\r\n      of the Phœnician religion from annals and state documents in the\r\n      archives of the _older_ Phœnician cities, and wrote it in Phœnician\r\n      characters in 1,250 B.C.\r\n\r\n 1018 Prof. Virchow, in Appendix I, to Schliemann’s _Ilios_.

These are the flattering terms in which the\r\n      _Evening Telegraph_ (of America) referred to this still unpublished\r\n      work in its issue of June 30, 1888: “_Among the fascinating books\r\n      for July reading_ is Mme. Blavatsky’s new book on Theosophy ... (!)\r\n      _The Secret Doctrine_.... But because she can soar back into the\r\n      Brahmin ignorance ... (!?) _is no proof that everything she says is\r\n      true_.” And once the prejudiced verdict has been given on the\r\n      mistaken notion that my book was out, and that the reviewer had read\r\n      it—neither of which was or could be the case—now that it is really\r\n      out, the critic will have to support his first statement, whether\r\n      correct or otherwise, and will get out of it, probably by a more\r\n      slashing criticism than ever.\r\n\r\n 1026 _Science of Language_, p. 168.\r\n\r\n 1027 _The Human Species_, p. 274.\r\n\r\n 1028 See above, the diagram of the Genealogical Tree of the Fifth Race.\r\n\r\n 1029 The Hegelian doctrine, which identifies Absolute Being or “Be‐ness”\r\n      with “Non‐Being,” and represents the Universe as an Eternal\r\n      Becoming, is identical with the Vedânta Philosophy.\r\n\r\n 1030 _The Religions of India_, p. xiii.\r\n\r\n 1031 Myer’s _Qabbalah_, p. 175.\r\n\r\n 1032 See De Mirville, _Pneumatologie_, iii. pp. 218 _et seqq._\r\n\r\n 1033 _Op. cit._, _ibid._\r\n\r\n 1034 See _Genesis_ and the authorized chronology.

The Nabatheans of Mount Lebanon\r\n      believed in the seven Archangels, as their forefathers had believed\r\n      in the seven Great Stars, the abodes and bodies of these Archangels,\r\n      which are believed in to this day by the Roman Catholics, as is\r\n      shown elsewhere.\r\n\r\n 1038 See _Isis Unveiled_, ii. 197.\r\n\r\n 1039 i. 354.\r\n\r\n 1040 Sayce; _cf._, p. 115, 2nd ed.\r\n\r\n 1041 _Op. cit._, pp. 418, 419.\r\n\r\n 1042 _Ibid._, p. 118.\r\n\r\n 1043 Simply, the womb, the “Holy of Holies” with the Semites.\r\n\r\n 1044 See the Valentinian Table in Epiphanius, _Adv.

It is the\r\n      later Rabbis and the Talmudic scheme that killed out all\r\n      spirituality from the body of their symbols; leaving only their\r\n      Scriptures—a dead shell, from which the soul has departed.\r\n\r\n 1046 See _II Samuel_, vi. 16‐22.\r\n\r\n 1047 _Psalms_, xxiv. 3.\r\n\r\n 1048 _II Kings_, xxiii. 7; see Dunlap, _Sôd; The Mysteries of Adoni_, p.\r\n      41.\r\n\r\n 1049 _Judges_, xxi. 21, 23 _et passim_.\r\n\r\n 1050 _I Kings_, xviii. 26.\r\n\r\n 1051 _Isis Unveiled_, ii. 49.\r\n\r\n 1052 _Ibid._, ii. 444.\r\n\r\n 1053 The author of the _Qabbalah_ makes several attempts to prove\r\n      conclusively the antiquity of the _Zohar_. Thus he shows that Moses\r\n      de Leon could not be the author or the forger of the Zoharic works\r\n      in the thirteenth century, as he is accused of being, since Ibn\r\n      Gebirol gave out the same philosophical teaching 225 years before\r\n      the day of Moses de Leon. No true Kabalist or scholar will ever deny\r\n      the fact. It is certain that Ibn Gebirol based his doctrines upon\r\n      the oldest Kabalistic sources, namely, the Chaldæan _Book of\r\n      Numbers_, as well as some no longer extant Midrashim, the same, no\r\n      doubt, as those used by Moses de Leon. But it is just the difference\r\n      between the two ways of treating the same Esoteric subjects,\r\n      which—while proving the enormous antiquity of the Esoteric\r\n      System—points to a decided ring of Talmudistic and even Christian\r\n      sectarianism in the compilation and glossaries of the Zoharic system\r\n      by Rabbi Moses. Ibn Gebirol _never quoted_ from the Scriptures to\r\n      enforce the teachings (Myer’s _Qabbalah_, p. 7). Whereas Moses de\r\n      Leon has made of the _Zohar_ that which it has remained to this day,\r\n      “a running commentary on the Five Books, or Pentateuch” (_ibid._),\r\n      with a few later additions made by Christian hands. One follows the\r\n      Archaic Esoteric Philosophy; the other, only that portion which was\r\n      adapted to the _lost_ Books of Moses restored by Ezra. Thus, while\r\n      the system, or the trunk on which the primitive original _Zohar_ was\r\n      engrafted, is of an immense antiquity, many of the (later) Zoharic\r\n      offshoots are strongly coloured by the peculiar views held by\r\n      Christian Gnostics (Syrian and Chaldæan), the friends and co‐workers\r\n      of Moses de Leon who, as shown by Munk, accepted their\r\n      interpretations.\r\n\r\n 1054 See Franck’s _Kabbala_, Preface.\r\n\r\n 1055 i. 14.\r\n\r\n 1056 See Schwartze, _op. cit._, _pagg._ 359, 361, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n 1057 Sayce, _Hibbert Lectures_, 1887, p. 374.\r\n\r\n 1058 Timæus, the Locrian, speaking of “Arka” [Arche], calls her “the\r\n      principle of best things” (Ἀρχὰ τῶν ἁρίστων). The word _arcane_,\r\n      “hidden,” or secret, is derived from this. “To no one is the\r\n      _Arcane_ shown except to the ... Most High” (_Codex\r\n      Nazaræus_)—alluding to Nature the female, and Spirit, the male\r\n      Power.

Moses was an Initiate, if he ever existed, and as such an\r\n      Ascetic, a Nazar, and could never have been married. It is an\r\n      allegory like everything else. Zipporah (the “shining”) is one of\r\n      the personified Occult Sciences given by Reuel‐Jethro, the Midian\r\n      priest Initiator, to Moses, his Egyptian pupil. The “well” by which\r\n      Moses sat down in his flight from the Pharaoh symbolizes the “Well\r\n      of Knowledge.”\r\n\r\n 1066 i. pp. 106‐108 and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n 1067 In Hebrew the phallic symbol Lingam and Yoni.\r\n\r\n 1068 See Vol. I, Stanza IV, Shloka 3.\r\n\r\n 1069 It is at that Step that one arrives on the plane of the level or\r\n      floor and open entrance to the King’s Chamber, the Egyptian “Holy of\r\n      Holies.”\r\n\r\n 1070 The Candidate for Initiation always personified the God of the\r\n      Temple he belonged to, as the High Priest personified the God at all\r\n      times; just as the Pope now personates Peter and even Jesus Christ\r\n      upon entering the inner sanctuary—the Christian “Holy of Holies.”\r\n\r\n 1071 _Genesis_, i. 27.\r\n\r\n 1072 Jehovah says to Moses: “the summation of my name is _sacr_, the\r\n      carrier of the germ”—phallus. “It is ... the vehicle of enunciation,\r\n      and truly enough, as the _sacr_, or carrier of the germ, its use\r\n      passed down through ages to the _sacr‐factum_ of the Roman priest,\r\n      and the _sacr‐fice_, and _sacr‐ment_ of the English speaking race.”\r\n      (_Source of Measures_, p. 236.)

No one who is\r\n      familiar with the Armenians and the Parsîs can fail to recognize in\r\n      the three the same Âryan, Caucasian type. From the seven primitive\r\n      types of the Fifth Race there now remain on Earth but three. As\r\n      Prof. W. H. Flower aptly said in 1885: “I cannot resist the\r\n      conclusion so often arrived at by various anthropologists—that the\r\n      primitive man, whatever he may have been, has in the course of ages\r\n      diverged into three extreme types, represented by the Caucasian of\r\n      Europe, the Mongolian of Asia, and the Ethiopian of Africa, and that\r\n      all existing individuals of the species can be ranged around these\r\n      types.” (The President’s Address at the Anthropological Institute of\r\n      Great Britain, etc.) Considering that our Race has reached its fifth\r\n      sub‐race, how can it be otherwise?\r\n\r\n 1081 Whenever such analogies between the Gentiles and the Jews, and later\r\n      the Christians, have been pointed out, it has been the invariable\r\n      custom of the latter to say that it was the work of the Devil who\r\n      forced the Pagans to imitate the Jews for the purpose of throwing a\r\n      slur on the religion of the _one, true living_ God. To this Faber\r\n      says very justly: “Some have imagined that the Gentiles were servile\r\n      copyists of the Israelites, and that each point of similitude was\r\n      borrowed from the Mosaical Institutes. But this theory will by no\r\n      means solve the problem. Both because we find the very same\r\n      resemblance in the ceremonies of nations far distant from Palestine,\r\n      as we do in the rites of those who are in its immediate vicinity,\r\n      and because it seems incredible that all should have borrowed from\r\n      one which was universally disliked and despised.” (_Pagan Idolatry_,\r\n      i. 104.)\r\n\r\n 1082 _Luke_, i. 28.\r\n\r\n 1083 Their consecrated Pillars (unhewn stones) erected by Abraham and\r\n      Jacob were _Lingams_.\r\n\r\n 1084 _Op. cit._, p. 67.\r\n\r\n 1085 See _Introduction to the Old Testament_, and also Bishop Colenso’s\r\n      _Elohistic and Jehovistic Writers_.\r\n\r\n 1086 King’s _Gnostics and their Remains_, p. 327, 2nd ed.\r\n\r\n 1087 _Ibid._, p. 326.\r\n\r\n 1088 Such a Pseudo‐Kabalist was the Marquis de Mirville in France, who\r\n      studied the _Zohar_ and other old remnants of Jewish Wisdom under\r\n      the “Chevalier” Drach, an ancient Rabbi Kabalist converted to the\r\n      Romish Church, and with his help wrote half a dozen volumes full of\r\n      slander and calumnies against every prominent Spiritualist and\r\n      Kabalist. From 1848 up to 1860 he persecuted unrelentingly the old\r\n      Count d’Ourches, one of the earliest Eastern Occultists in France, a\r\n      man the scope of whose Occult knowledge will never be appreciated\r\n      correctly by his survivors, because he screened his real beliefs and\r\n      knowledge under the mask of Spiritism.\r\n\r\n 1089 See _Hibbert Lectures_, 1887, pp. 101‐115.\r\n\r\n 1090 _Exodus_, xxii. 28.\r\n\r\n 1091 _Deut._, iv. 19.\r\n\r\n 1092 _Jude_, 8, 9.\r\n\r\n 1093 See _Isis Unveiled_, ii. 487, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n 1094 Treat, _Kiddusheem_, 81.

The only Pharaoh whom the _Bible_ shows going down\r\n      into the Red Sea was the king who pursued the Israelites, and who\r\n      remained unnamed, for very good reasons perhaps. The story was\r\n      surely made up from the Atlantean legend.\r\n\r\n 1136 xxviii. 13, 14.\r\n\r\n 1137 xxxi. 3‐9.\r\n\r\n 1138 _Vishnu Purâna._ I. xv.\r\n\r\n 1139 This is pure allegory. The Waters are a symbol of Wisdom and of\r\n      Occult Learning. Hermes represented the Sacred Science under the\r\n      symbol of Fire; the Northern Initiates, under that of Water. The\r\n      latter is the production of Nara, the “Spirit of God,” or rather\r\n      Paramâtman, the “Supreme Soul,” says Kullûka Bhatta; Nârâyana,\r\n      meaning “he who abides in the deep” or is plunged in the Waters of\r\n      Wisdom—“water being the body of Nara” (_Vâyu Purâna_). Hence arises\r\n      the statement that for 10,000 years they remained in austerity “in\r\n      the vast ocean”; and are shown emerging from it. Ea, the God of\r\n      Wisdom, is the “Sublime Fish,” and Dagon or Oannes is the Chaldæan\r\n      Man‐Fish, who emerges from the Waters to teach Wisdom.\r\n\r\n 1140 Chap. v; “Sacred Books of the East,” vol. viii. p. 257.\r\n\r\n 1141 This is explained by the able translator of _Anugîtâ_ in a foot‐note\r\n      (p. 258) in these words: “The sense appears to be this: The course\r\n      of worldly life is due to the operations of the life‐winds which are\r\n      attached to the Self, and lead to its manifestations as individual\r\n      souls.”\r\n\r\n 1142 Vaishvânara is a word often used to denote the Self—explains\r\n      Nîlakantha.\r\n\r\n 1143 _Ibid._, p. 259.

Freed from the former,\r\n      he soars for the time being in the ethereal higher regions, becoming\r\n      virtually “as one of the Gods,” and yet preserving in his physical\r\n      brain the memory of what he sees and learns. Plainly speaking, Soma\r\n      is the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge forbidden by the jealous\r\n      Elohim to Adam and Eve or Yah‐ve, “lest man should become as one of\r\n      us.”\r\n\r\n 1151 We see the same in the modern exoteric religions.\r\n\r\n 1152 _Historical View of the Hindû Astronomy._ Quoting from the work in\r\n      reference to “Argabhatta” [? Âryabhatta] who is said to give a near\r\n      approach to the true relation among the various values for the\r\n      computations of the value of π, the author of _The Source of\r\n      Measures_ reproduces a curious statement. “Mr. Bentley,” it is said,\r\n      “was greatly familiar with the Hindû astronomical and mathematical\r\n      knowledge.... This statement of his may then be taken as authentic.\r\n      The same remarkable trait, among so many Eastern and ancient\r\n      nations, of _sedulously concealing the arcana of this kind of\r\n      knowledge, is a marked one_ among the Hindûs. That which was given\r\n      out to be popularly taught, and to be exposed to public inspection,\r\n      _was but the approximate of a more exact but hidden knowledge_. And\r\n      this very formulation of Mr. Bentley will strangely exemplify the\r\n      assertion; and, explained, will show that it [the Hindû _exoteric_\r\n      astronomy and sciences] was derived _from a system exact beyond the\r\n      European one_, in which Mr. Bentley himself, of course, trusted, as\r\n      far in advance of the Hindû knowledge, at any time, in any\r\n      generation” (pp. 86, 87).\r\n\r\n      This is Mr. Bentley’s misfortune, and does not take away from the\r\n      glory of the ancient Hindû Astronomers, who were all Initiates.\r\n\r\n 1153 The Secret Doctrine teaches that every event of universal\r\n      importance, such as geological cataclysms at the end of one Race and\r\n      the beginning of a new one, involving a great change each time in\r\n      mankind, spiritual, moral and physical—is precogitated and\r\n      preconcerted, so to say, in the sidereal regions of our planetary\r\n      system. Astrology is built wholly upon this mystic and intimate\r\n      connection between the heavenly bodies and mankind; and it is one of\r\n      the great secrets of Initiation and Occult Mysteries.\r\n\r\n 1154 See Darmesteter’s _Vendidâd_, Introd., p. lviii.\r\n\r\n 1155 See _Isaiah_, xiv. 12.\r\n\r\n 1156 _Genesis_, vi.\r\n\r\n 1157 The Nâgas are described by the Orientalists as a mysterious people\r\n      whose landmarks are found abundantly in India to this day, and who\r\n      lived in Nâga‐dvîpa, one of the _seven_ continents or divisions of\r\n      Bhâratavarsha (old India); the town of Nagpur being one of the most\r\n      ancient cities in the country.\r\n\r\n 1158 xxviii. 3, 4.\r\n\r\n 1159 Not less suggestive are the qualities attributed to Rudra Shiva, the\r\n      great Yogî, the forefather of all the Adepts—in Esotericism one of\r\n      the greatest Kings of the Divine Dynasties. Called the “earliest”\r\n      and the “last,” he is the patron of the Third, Fourth, and the Fifth\r\n      Root‐Races. For, in his earliest character, he is the ascetic Dig‐\r\n      ambara, “clothed with the elements,” Tri‐lochana, the “three‐eyed,”\r\n      Pancha‐ânana, the “five‐faced,” an allusion to the past Four and the\r\n      present Fifth Race, for, though five‐faced, he is only “four‐armed,”\r\n      as the Fifth Race is still alive. He is the “God of Time,” Saturn‐\r\n      Cronus, as his “drum” Damaru, in the shape of an hour‐glass, shows;\r\n      and if he is accused of having cut off Brahma’s fifth head, and left\r\n      him with only four, it is again an allusion to a certain degree in\r\n      Initiation, and also to the Races.\r\n\r\n 1160 Gustav Seiffarth’s idea that the signs of the Zodiac were in ancient\r\n      times only ten is erroneous. Ten only were known to the profane; the\r\n      Initiates, however, knew them all, _from the time of the separation\r\n      of mankind into sexes_, whence arose the separation of Virgo‐Scorpio\r\n      into two. This separation, owing to the addition of a secret sign\r\n      and the Libra invented by the Greeks, instead of the secret name\r\n      which was not given, made twelve. (See _Isis Unveiled_, ii. 456.)\r\n\r\n 1161 The above is, perhaps, a key to the Dalaï Lama’s symbolical name—the\r\n      “Ocean” Lama, meaning the Wisdom‐Ocean. Abbé Huc speaks of this.\r\n\r\n 1162 _Zohar_, iii. 9b, 10a, Brody Ed. Cremona Ed. iii. fol. 4a, col. 14.\r\n      Myer’s _Qabbalah_, pp. 416, 417.\r\n\r\n 1163 Such was the name given in ancient Judea to the Initiates, called\r\n      also the “Innocents” and the “Infants,” _i.e._, once more “reborn.”\r\n      This _key_ opens a vista into one of the _New Testament_ mysteries;\r\n      the slaughter by Herod of the 40,000 “Innocents.” There is a legend\r\n      to this effect, and the event, which took place almost a century\r\n      B.C., shows the origin of the tradition blended at the same time\r\n      with that of Krishna and his uncle Kansa. In the case of the _New\r\n      Testament_, Herod stands for Alexander Jannæus (of Lyda), whose\r\n      persecution and murder of hundreds and thousands of Initiates led to\r\n      the adoption of the _Bible_ story.\r\n\r\n 1164 _Zohar_, ii. 34.\r\n\r\n 1165 i. § 16.\r\n\r\n 1166 _Op. cit._, lxxiv. 13.\r\n\r\n 1167 _Ibid._, § 33.\r\n\r\n 1168 P. 16.\r\n\r\n 1169 “Biographical and Critical Essay,” p. xxxviii.\r\n\r\n 1170 _Histoire de la Magic_, pp. 16, 17.\r\n\r\n 1171 _Ibid._, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n 1172 What _devil_ could be possessed of more cunning, craft and cruelty\r\n      than the Whitechapel murderer, “Jack the Ripper” of 1888, whose\r\n      unparalleled, blood‐thirsty and cool wickedness led him to slaughter\r\n      and mutilate in cold blood seven unfortunate and _otherwise_\r\n      innocent women!

After the Polymorphic Pantheism of some Gnostics\r\n      came the Exoteric Dualism of Manes, who was accused of personifying\r\n      Evil and making of the Devil a God—the rival of God himself. We do\r\n      not see that the Christian Church has so much improved on that\r\n      exoteric idea of the Manicheans, for she calls God her King of\r\n      Light, and Satan the King of Darkness, to this day.\r\n\r\n 1179 To quote in this relation Mr. S. Laing, in his admirable work\r\n      _Modern Science and Modern Thought_ (p. 222): “From this dilemma\r\n      [the existence of evil in the world] there is no escape, unless we\r\n      give up altogether the idea of an anthropomorphic deity, and adopt\r\n      frankly the scientific idea of a First Cause, inscrutable and past\r\n      finding out; and of a universe whose laws we can trace, but of whose\r\n      real essence we know nothing, and can only suspect or faintly\r\n      discern a fundamental law which may make the polarity of good and\r\n      evil a necessary condition of existence.” Were Science to know “the\r\n      real essence,” instead of knowing nothing of it, the faint suspicion\r\n      would turn into the certitude of the existence of such a law, and\r\n      the knowledge that this law is connected with Karma.\r\n\r\n 1180 _Histoire de la Magie_, pp. 196, 197.\r\n\r\n 1181 Âkâsha is _not_ the Ether of Science, as some Orientalists translate\r\n      it.\r\n\r\n 1182 Says Johannes Tritheim, the Abbot of Spanheim, the greatest\r\n      Astrologer and Kabalist of his day: “The art of divine magic\r\n      consists in the ability to perceive the essence of things in the\r\n      Light of Nature [Astral Light], and by using the soul‐powers of the\r\n      spirit to produce material things from the unseen universe, and in\r\n      such operations the Above and the Below must be brought together and\r\n      made to act harmoniously. The Spirit of Nature [Astral Light] is a\r\n      unity, creating and forming everything, and by acting through the\r\n      instrumentality of man it may produce wonderful things. Such\r\n      processes take place according to law. You will learn the law by\r\n      which these things are accomplished, if you learn to know yourself.\r\n      You will know it by the power of the spirit that is in yourself, and\r\n      accomplish it by mixing your spirit with the essence that comes out\r\n      of yourself. If you wish to succeed in such a work you must know how\r\n      to separate spirit and life in Nature, and, moreover, to separate\r\n      the astral soul in yourself and to make it tangible, and then the\r\n      substance of the soul will appear visibly and tangibly, rendered\r\n      objective by the power of the spirit.” (Quoted in Dr. Franz\r\n      Hartmann’s _Paracelsus_, pp. 164, 165.)\r\n\r\n 1183 The real original text of _I Corinthians_, xv. 44, rendered\r\n      kabalistically and Esoterically would read: “It is sown a _soul_\r\n      body [not ‘natural’ body], it is raised a _spirit_ body.” St. Paul\r\n      was an Initiate, and his words have quite a different meaning when\r\n      read Esoterically. The body “is sown in _weakness_ [passivity]; it\r\n      is raised in power” (v. 43)—or in spirituality and intellect.\r\n\r\n 1184 “The War in Heaven” (_Theosophist_, iii. 24, 36, 67), by Godolphin\r\n      Mitford, later in life Murad Ali Beg. Born in India, the son of a\r\n      missionary, G. Mitford was converted to Islam, and died a Mahomedan\r\n      in 1884. He was a most extraordinary Mystic, of great learning and\r\n      remarkable intelligence. But he left the Right Path and forthwith\r\n      fell under Karmic retribution. As well shown by the author of the\r\n      article quoted, “The followers of the defeated ‘Elohim’ first\r\n      massacred by the victorious Jews [the Jehovites], and then persuaded\r\n      by the victorious Christians and Mohamedans, continued\r\n      [nevertheless].... Some [of these scattered sects] ... have lost\r\n      even the tradition of the true rationale of their belief—to worship\r\n      in secrecy and mystery the Principle of Fire, Light, and Liberty.\r\n      Why do the Sabean Bedouins (avowedly Monotheists when dwelling in\r\n      the Mohamedan cities) in the solitude of the desert night yet invoke\r\n      the starry ‘Host of Heaven’? Why do the Yezidis, the ‘Devil\r\n      Worshippers,’ worship the ‘Muluk‐Taoos’—the ‘Lord Peacock’—the\r\n      emblem of _Pride_ and of Hundred‐eyed Intelligence [and of\r\n      Initiation also], which was expelled from Heaven with Satan,\r\n      according to an old Oriental tradition? Why do the Gholaites and\r\n      their kindred Mesopotamo‐Iranian Mohamedan Sects believe in the\r\n      ‘Noor Illahee’—the ‘Light of the Elohim’—transmitted in _anastasis_\r\n      through a hundred Prophet‐Leaders? It is because they have continued\r\n      in ignorant superstition the traditional religion of the ‘Light\r\n      Deities’ whom Jahveh overthrew!” (p. 69)—is _said_ to have\r\n      overthrown rather; for by overthrowing _them_ he would have\r\n      overthrown himself. The Muluk‐Taoos is Maluk, “Ruler,” as is shown\r\n      in the foot‐note. It is only a new form of Moloch, Melek, Molech,\r\n      Malayak, and Malachim—Messengers, Angels, etc.\r\n\r\n 1185 So does every Yogi and even Christian, for one must take the Kingdom\r\n      of Heaven _by violence_—we are taught. Why then should such a desire\r\n      make of any one a Devil?\r\n\r\n 1186 _Acad. des Inscrip._, xxxix. 690.\r\n\r\n 1187 Fargard, xix. 47; Darmesteter’s Trans., p. 218.\r\n\r\n 1188 _Vendidad_, Far. xx. 12; _op. cit._, p. 222.\r\n\r\n 1189 _Ibid._, Far. xix. 43; _op. cit._, p. 218.\r\n\r\n 1190 From the _Vendidad Sadah_, quoted by Darmesteter, _op. cit._, p.\r\n      223.\r\n\r\n 1191 See the Gâtha in Yasna xliv.\r\n\r\n 1192 _Op. cit._, p. 441.\r\n\r\n 1193 _Apollodorus_, I. 7, 1.\r\n\r\n 1194 Ovid., _Metam._, I. 81. _Etym.

There is the _upper_\r\n      and _nether_ piece of timber used to produce this sacred fire by\r\n      attrition at sacrifices, and it is the Aranì which contains the\r\n      socket. This is proven by an allegory in the _Vâyu_ and other\r\n      _Purânas_, which tell us that Nimi, the son of Ikshvàku, had left no\r\n      successor, and that the Rishis, fearing to leave the Earth without a\r\n      ruler, introduced the king’s body into the socket of an Arani—like\r\n      an upper Aranì—and produced from it a prince named Janaka. “It was\r\n      by reason of the peculiar way in which he was engendered that he was\r\n      called Janaka.” See also Goldstücker’s _Sanskrit Dictionary_, _sub\r\n      voce_.

Mr.\r\n      Gerald Massey gives also an astronomical reason for it which may be\r\n      found in vol. i. pp. 322, 323, of the present work. “The cat saw the\r\n      sun, had it in its eye by night [was the eye of night], when it was\r\n      otherwise unseen by men [for as the Moon reflects the light of the\r\n      Sun, so the cat was supposed to reflect it on account of its\r\n      phosphorescent eyes]. _We_ might say the moon _mirrored_ the solar\r\n      light, because we have _looking glasses_. With them the cat’s eye\r\n      _was_ the mirror.” (_Luniolatry Ancient and Modern_, p. 2.)\r\n\r\n 1302 _Ezekiel_, i. 4, 15, 16, 20.\r\n\r\n 1303 _Eccles._, i. 6.\r\n\r\n 1304 Fol. 87, col. 346.\r\n\r\n 1305 Vol. ii. pp. 299, 300.\r\n\r\n 1306 _Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie_, i. 124.

And this true Divinity shows well that the lesser one, our\r\n      _inner_ God (personal for the time being), has no power to arrest\r\n      the mighty hand of this greater Deity—the Cause awakened by our\r\n      actions generating smaller causes—which is called the Law of\r\n      Retribution.\r\n\r\n 1309 See _Isis Unveiled_, i. xii and xviii.\r\n\r\n 1310 Stobæus, _Ecl._, i. 862.\r\n\r\n 1311 The Svastika is certainty one of the oldest symbols of the Ancient\r\n      Races.

W. King, the great authority on Gnostic\r\n      antiquities, these “Gnostic” gems are not the work of the Gnostics,\r\n      but belong to Pre‐Christian periods, and are the work of “magicians”\r\n      (_op. cit._, p. 241).\r\n\r\n 1332 King, _ibid._, p. 218.\r\n\r\n 1333 The lack of intuition in Orientalists and Antiquarians past and\r\n      present, is remarkable. Thus, Wilson, the translator of _Vishnu\r\n      Purâna_, declares in his Preface that in the _Garuda Purâna_ he\r\n      found “no account of the birth of Garuda.” Considering that an\r\n      account of “Creation” in general is given therein, and that Garuda\r\n      is coëternal with Vishnu, the Mahâ Kalpa, or Great Life‐Cycle,\r\n      beginning with and ending with the _manifesting_ Vishnu, what other\r\n      account of Garuda’s birth could be expected!\r\n\r\n 1334 _Ibid._, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n 1335 See _Revelation_, xvii. 2 and 10; and _Leviticus_, xxiii. 15 to 18;\r\n      the first passage speaking of the “seven Kings,” of whom _five_ have\r\n      gone; and the second about the “seven Sabbaths,” etc.\r\n\r\n 1336 _Op. cit._, x. 5‐7.\r\n\r\n 1337 _Pistis Sophia_ is an extremely important document, a genuine\r\n      Evangel of the Gnostics, ascribed, at random to Valectinus, but much\r\n      more probably a Pre‐Christian work as to its original. A Coptic MS.\r\n      of this work was brought back by Bruce from Abyssinia and discovered\r\n      by Schwartze, in the British Museum, quite accidentally, and\r\n      translated by him into Latin. The text and Schwartze’s version were\r\n      published by Petermann in the year 1853. In the text itself the\r\n      authorship of this Book is ascribed to Philip the Apostle, whom\r\n      Jesus bids sit down and write the revelation. It is genuine and\r\n      ought to be as canonical as any other Gospel. Unfortunately it\r\n      remains to this day untranslated into English.\r\n\r\n 1338 King, _op. cit._, p. 200.\r\n\r\n 1339 In the Cycle of Initiation, which was very long, Water represented\r\n      the first and lower steps toward purification, while trials\r\n      connected with Fire came last. Water could regenerate the Body of\r\n      Matter; Fire alone, that of the Inner Spiritual Man.\r\n\r\n 1340 Chap. ix.\r\n\r\n 1341 See the Introduction by Káshináth Trimbak Telang, M.A.\r\n\r\n 1342 “Sacred Books of the East,” vol. viii. p. 276.\r\n\r\n 1343 _Ibid._\r\n\r\n 1344 _Ibid._\r\n\r\n 1345 Pp. 258, 259.\r\n\r\n 1346 _Ibid._, p. 257.\r\n\r\n 1347 _Ibid._, p. 259.\r\n\r\n 1348 In the astronomical and cosmical key, Vaishvânara is Agni, son of\r\n      the Sun, or Vishvânara, but in the psycho‐metaphysical symbolism it\r\n      is the Self, in the sense of non‐separateness, _i.e._, both divine\r\n      and human.\r\n\r\n 1349 Here the speaker personifies the said divine Self.\r\n\r\n 1350 _Ibid._\r\n\r\n 1351 Compare with these “pairs of opposites,” in the _Anugîtâ_, the\r\n      “pairs” of Æons, in the elaborate system of Valentinus, the most\r\n      learned and profound Master of the Gnosis. As the “pairs of\r\n      opposites,” male and female, are all derived from Âkâsha\r\n      (undeveloped and developed, differentiated and undifferentiated, or\r\n      Self or Prajâpati), so are the Valentinian “pairs” of male and\r\n      female Æons shown to emanate from Bythos, the preëxisting eternal\r\n      Depth, and in their secondary emanation from Ampsiu‐Ouraan, or\r\n      sempiternal Depth and Silence, the second Logos. In the Esoteric\r\n      emanation there are seven chief “pairs of opposites”; and so also in\r\n      the Valentinian system there were fourteen, or twice seven.\r\n      Epiphanius “copied one pair twice over,” Mr. C. W. King thinks, “and\r\n      thus adds one pair to the proper fifteen.” (_The Gnostics and their\r\n      Remains_, pp. 263, 264.) Here King falls into the opposite error;\r\n      the pairs of Æons are not 15 (a “blind”) but 14, as the _first_ Æon\r\n      is That from which others emanate, Depth and Silence being the first\r\n      and only emanation from Bythos. As Hippolytus shows: “The Æons of\r\n      Valentinus are confessedly the _six_ Radicals of Simon (Magus),”\r\n      with the _seventh_, Fire, at their head. And these are: Mind,\r\n      Intelligence, Voice, Name, Reason and Thought, subordinate to Fire,\r\n      the Higher Self, or precisely the “Seven Winds” or the “Seven\r\n      Priests” of _Anugîtâ_.\r\n\r\n 1352 Not necessarily at death only, but during Samâdhi or mystic trance.\r\n\r\n 1353 All the words and sentences between parenthetical marks are the\r\n      writer’s. This is translated directly from the Latin translation.\r\n      King’s translation conforms too much to Gnosticism as explained by\r\n      the Church Fathers.\r\n\r\n 1354 Barbelo is one of the three “Invisible Gods,” and, as C. W. King\r\n      believes, includes the “Divine Mother of the Saviour,” or rather\r\n      Sophia Achamoth (_cf._ _Pistis Sophia_, pag. 359).\r\n\r\n 1355 _Pagg._ 378, 379.\r\n\r\n 1356 In other _Purânas_ Jatâyu is the son of Aruna, Garuda’s brother,\r\n      both the sons of Kashyapa. But all this is external allegory.\r\n\r\n 1357 IX. viii. 12, 13.\r\n\r\n 1358 From Burnouf’s Translation; see Wilson’s _Vishnu Purâna_, iii. 300.\r\n\r\n 1359 Wilson, _ibid._, p. 302, note.\r\n\r\n 1360 See _Vâyu Purâna_, which places him in the list of the forty\r\n      renowned sons of Kashyapa.\r\n\r\n 1361 _The Ordinances of Manu_, i. 16; Burnell’s Translation, p. 3, note.\r\n\r\n 1362 _Ibid._, 27; p. 5.\r\n\r\n 1363 Vol. i. pp. 355, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n 1364 _Orthodoxie Maçonnique Suivie de la Maçonnerie Occulte et de\r\n      l’Initiation Hermétique_, J.

In\r\n      geometry, one straight line fails to represent a perfect figure, nor\r\n      can two straight lines constitute a perfect figure. The triangle is\r\n      the first perfect figure.\r\n\r\n 1366 Ragon, _ibid._, p. 428, note.\r\n\r\n 1367 _Ibid._, p. 431.\r\n\r\n 1368 _Op. cit._, p. 113.\r\n\r\n 1369 Now what is the meaning and the reason of this figure? The reason is\r\n      that Manas is the _fifth_ principle, and that the Pentagon is the\r\n      symbol of Man—not only of the five‐limbed, but rather of the\r\n      _thinking, conscious_ Man.\r\n\r\n 1370 The reason for it becomes apparent when Egyptian symbology is\r\n      studied.

B. 17) “Osiris,\r\n      the double crocodile.” “He is the good and the bad Principle; the\r\n      Day and the Night Sun, the God and the mortal man.” Thus far the\r\n      Macrocosm and the Microcosm.\r\n\r\n 1380 _Op. cit._, p. 117.\r\n\r\n 1381 King’s _Gnostics and their Remains_, p. 297.\r\n\r\n 1382 Reflecting on the cross, the author of _The Source of Measures_\r\n      shows that this candlestick in the Temple “was so composed that,\r\n      counting on either side, there were _four_ candle‐sockets; while, at\r\n      the apex, there being _one in common_ to both sides, there were in\r\n      fact 3 to be counted on the one side and 4 on the other, making in\r\n      all the number 7, upon the self‐same idea of one in common with the\r\n      cross display. Take a line of one unit in breadth by 3 units long,\r\n      and place it on an incline; take another of 4 units long, and lean\r\n      it upon this one, from an opposite incline, making the top unit of\r\n      the 4 in length the corner or apex of a triangle. This is the\r\n      display of the candlestick. Now, take away the line of 3 units in\r\n      length, and _cross_ it on the one of 4 units in length, and the\r\n      cross form results. The same idea is conveyed in the six days of the\r\n      week in Genesis, crowned by the seventh, which was used by itself as\r\n      a base of circular measure” (p. 51).\r\n\r\n 1383 From a MS. supposed to be by “St. Germain,” embodied by Ragon, _op.\r\n      cit._, p. 434.\r\n\r\n 1384 It had no such meaning in the beginnings, nor during the earlier\r\n      dynasties.\r\n\r\n 1385 From an unpublished MS.\r\n\r\n 1386 From St. Germain’s MS.\r\n\r\n 1387 Yet this sense, if once mastered, will turn out to be the secure\r\n      casket which holds the keys to the Secret Wisdom. True, a casket so\r\n      profusely ornamented that its fancy‐work hides and conceals entirely\r\n      any spring for opening it, and thus makes the unintuitional believe\r\n      it has not, and cannot have, any opening at all. Still the keys are\r\n      there, deeply buried, yet ever present to him who searches for them.\r\n\r\n 1388 _Vishnu Purúna_, I. xv; Wilson’s Trans., ii. 29.\r\n\r\n 1389 Quoted in Gerald Massey’s _The Natural Genesis_, i. 427.\r\n\r\n 1390 With the Christians, most undeniably. With the Pre‐Christian\r\n      Symbologists it was, as said, the Bed or Couch of Torture during the\r\n      Initiation Mystery, the “Crucifix” being placed horizontally, on the\r\n      ground, and not erect, as at the time when it became the Roman\r\n      gallows.\r\n\r\n 1391 So it was, and could not be otherwise. Julian, the Emperor, was an\r\n      Initiate, and as such knew well the “mystery‐meaning” both\r\n      metaphysical and physical.\r\n\r\n 1392 _Op. cit._, _ibid._, p. 433.\r\n\r\n 1393 _Book of the Dead._ xxxix. Apophis or Apap is the Serpent of Evil,\r\n      the symbol of human passions. The Sun (Osiris‐Horus) destroys him,\r\n      and Apap is thrown down, bound and chained. The God Aker, the “Chief\r\n      of the Gate of the Abyss” of Aker, the Realm of the Sun (xv. 39),\r\n      binds him. Apophis is the enemy of Ra (Light), but the “great Apap\r\n      has fallen!” exclaims the Defunct. “The Scorpion has hurt thy\r\n      mouth,” he says to the conquered enemy (xxxix. 7). The Scorpion is\r\n      the “worm that never dies” of the Christians. Apophis is bound on\r\n      the Tau or Tat, the “emblem of stability.” (See the erection of Tat\r\n      in Tatoo, xviii.)\r\n\r\n 1394 So have the crypts in Cis‐Himâlayan regions where Initiates live,\r\n      and where their ashes are placed for seven lunar years.\r\n\r\n 1395 _The Natural Genesis_, i. 432.\r\n\r\n 1396 The Cross and the Tree are identical and synonymous in symbolism.\r\n\r\n 1397 lvii. 3.\r\n\r\n 1398 _Ibid._, 5.\r\n\r\n 1399 Sermon clx.\r\n\r\n 1400 _Vishnu Purâna_, Wilson’s Trans., iii. 174, note by Fitzedward Hall.\r\n\r\n 1401 Hence the Initiates in Greece called the Tau Γαιήιος, “son of Gaia,”\r\n      “sprung from Earth,” like Tityos in the _Odyssey_ (vii. 324).\r\n\r\n 1402 Ragon, _Orthodoxie Maçonnique_, etc., pp. 432, 433.\r\n\r\n 1403 _Ibid._, p. 433, note.\r\n\r\n 1404 See the _Mahâbhârata_, _e.g._, III. 189, 3, where Vishnu says, “I\r\n      called the name of water Nârâ in ancient times, and am hence called\r\n      Nârâyana, for that was always the abode I moved in (Ayana).” It is\r\n      into the Water, or Chaos, the “Moist Principle” of the Greeks and\r\n      Hermes, that the first seed of the Universe is thrown. “The ‘Spirit\r\n      of God’ moves on the dark waters of Space”; hence Thales makes of it\r\n      the primordial element and prior to Fire, which was yet latent in\r\n      that Spirit.\r\n\r\n 1405 See the bronze statue of Tripurântaka Shiva, “Mahâdeva destroying\r\n      Tripurâsura,” at the Museum of the India House.\r\n\r\n 1406 Ragon, _ibid._, p. 433, note.\r\n\r\n 1407 There are learned Brâhmans who have protested against our septenary\r\n      division. They are right from their own standpoint, as we are right\r\n      from ours. Leaving the three _aspects_, or _adjunct principles_ out\r\n      of calculation, they accept only four Upâdhis, or Bases, including\r\n      the Ego—the reflected image of the Logos in the Kârana Sharîra—and\r\n      even “strictly speaking ... only three Upâdhis.” For purely\r\n      theoretical metaphysical philosophy, or purposes of meditation,\r\n      these three may be sufficient, as shown by the Târaka Yoga system;\r\n      but for _practical occult teaching_ our septenary division is the\r\n      best and easiest. It is, however, a matter of school and choice.\r\n\r\n 1408 _Commentary_, Book ix. F. 19.\r\n\r\n 1409 Protista are not animals. The reader is asked to bear in mind that\r\n      when we speak of “animals,” the mammalians alone are meant.\r\n      Crustacea, fishes, and reptiles are contemporary with, and most have\r\n      preceded, _physical_ man in this Round. All were bisexual, however,\r\n      before the age of mammalia in the closing portion of the Secondary\r\n      or Mesozoic ages, _yet nearer to the Palæozoic than the Cænozoic\r\n      ages_. Smaller marsupial mammalia are contemporary with the huge\r\n      reptilian monsters of the Secondary.\r\n\r\n 1410 _Æneid_, vi. 725‐729. “First [Divine] Spirit within sustains the\r\n      heavens, the earth and watery plains, the moon’s orb and shining\r\n      stars and the [Eternal] Mind diffused through all the parts [of\r\n      Nature], actuates the whole stupendous frame and mingles with the\r\n      vast body [of the Universe]. Thence proceed _the race of men and\r\n      beasts_, the _vital principles_ of the flying kind and the monsters\r\n      which the Ocean breeds under its smooth crystal plane.” “All\r\n      proceeds from Ether and from its seven natures”—said the Alchemists.\r\n      Science knows these only in their superficial effects.\r\n\r\n 1411 Compare _Descent of Man_, p. 164.\r\n\r\n 1412 Bartlett’s _Land and Water_.\r\n\r\n 1413 _Source of Measures_, p. 65. The author explains: “_Note_ that in\r\n      Hebrew, _Jared_, the father of Enoch, is construed to be ‘_the mount\r\n      of descent_,’ and it is said to be the same with _Ararat_, on which\r\n      the cubical structure of _Noah_, or _foundation measure_, rested.\r\n      _Jared_, in Hebrew, is י־רד. The root derivations are the same with\r\n      those of _Ararat_, of _acre_, of _earth_. The Hebrew י־רד is\r\n      _literally, in British_, Y R D; hence, in _Jared_, is to be found\r\n      _literally_, our English word _yard_ (and also י־רד, for _Jah_, or\r\n      _Jehovah, is rod_). It is noteworthy that the son of _Jared_, viz.,\r\n      _Enoch_, lived 365 years; and it is said of him, by rabbinical\r\n      commentators, that the year period of 365 days was discovered by\r\n      him, thus bringing, again, _time_ and _distance_ values together,\r\n      _i.e._, _year time_ descended, by coördination, through the _yard_,\r\n      or _Jared_, who _thus was its father_, in or through _Enoch_; and\r\n      truly enough, 1296 = _yard_ (or _Jared_) × 4 = 5184, the\r\n      characteristic value of the solar day, in _thirds_, which, as\r\n      stated, may be styled the _parent, numerically_, of the solar year”\r\n      (_ibid._). This, however, by the astronomical and numerical\r\n      kabalistic methods. Esoterically, Jared is the Third Race and Enoch\r\n      the Fourth—but as he is taken away alive he symbolizes also the\r\n      Elect saved in the Fourth, while Noah is the Fifth from the\r\n      beginning—the family saved from the Waters, eternally and\r\n      _physically_.\r\n\r\n 1414 vii. 2, 3.\r\n\r\n 1415 _Five Years of Theosophy_, pp. 202, 203.\r\n\r\n 1416 _Ibid._, p. 200.\r\n\r\n 1417 Oliver’s _Pythagorean Triangle_, p. 104.\r\n\r\n 1418 _De Anim.

While there are but 6 faces to a cube, the\r\n      representation of the cross as the cube unfolded, as to the cross‐\r\n      bars, displays one face of the cube _as common to two bars_, counted\r\n      as belonging to either [_i.e._, once counted horizontally, and once\r\n      vertically]; ... 4 for the upright, and 3 for the cross‐bar, making\r\n      _seven_ in all. Here we have the famous 4 and 3 and 7.” Esoteric\r\n      Philosophy explains that _four_ is the symbol of the Universe in its\r\n      potential state, or Chaotic Matter, and that it requires Spirit to\r\n      permeate it actively; _i.e._, the primordial _abstract_ Triangle has\r\n      to quit its one‐dimensional quality and spread across that Matter,\r\n      thus forming a _manifested_ basis on the three‐dimensional space, in\r\n      order that the Universe should manifest intelligibly. This is\r\n      achieved by the cube unfolded. Hence the _ansated_ cross as the\r\n      symbol of man, generation and life. In Egypt Ank signified “soul,”\r\n      “life” and “blood.” It is the _ensouled, living_ man, the septenary.\r\n\r\n 1422 _Supra_, p. 626.\r\n\r\n 1423 Oliver, _ibid._, p. 114.\r\n\r\n 1424 _Pythag._, p. 61.\r\n\r\n 1425 Oliver, _ibid._, p. 172.\r\n\r\n 1426 _De Plac.

There may be\r\n      nine and ninety‐nine other planets discovered—this does not alter\r\n      the fact of these seven alone being sacred.\r\n\r\n 1434 Oliver, _ibid._, pp. 173, 174.\r\n\r\n 1435 _Ibid._, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n 1436 _The Natural Genesis_, i. 545.\r\n\r\n 1437 _Ibid._\r\n\r\n 1438 In _Timæus_, iii.; _ibid._\r\n\r\n 1439 Oliver, _ibid._, p. 175.\r\n\r\n 1440 See Section F., _infra_, “The Seven Souls of the Egyptologists.”\r\n\r\n 1441 The Seven Centres of Energy evolved, or rendered objective by the\r\n      action of Fohat upon the One Element; or, in fact, the “Seventh\r\n      Principle” of the Seven Elements which exist throughout manifested\r\n      Kosmos. We may here point out that they are in truth the Sephiroth\r\n      of the Kabalists; the “Seven gifts of the Holy Ghost” in the\r\n      Christian system; and in a mystical sense, the seven children or\r\n      sons of Devakî killed before the birth of Krishna by Kansa. Our\r\n      seven principles symbolize all of these. We have to part or separate\r\n      from them before we reach the Krishna or Christ‐state, that of a\r\n      Jîvanmukta, and centre ourselves entirely in the highest, the\r\n      Seventh or the One.\r\n\r\n 1442 Μοῖρα, is destiny, not “Fate,” in this case, as it is an\r\n      appellation, not a proper noun. (See Wolf’s transl., _Odyssey_,\r\n      xxii. 413.) But Moira, the Goddess of Fate, is a deity who, like\r\n      Αἶσα, _gives to all their portion of good and evil_ (Liddell and\r\n      Scott’s Lexicon), and is therefore Karma. By this abbreviation,\r\n      however, _the subject_ to Destiny or Karma is meant, the Self or\r\n      Ego, and that which is reborn. Nor is Ἀντιμῖμον Πνεύματος our\r\n      conscience, but our Buddhî; nor is it again the “counterfeit” of\r\n      Spirit but “modelled after,” or a “counterpart” (Aristoph.,\r\n      _Thesmophor._, 27) of the Spirit—which Buddhî is, as the vehicle of\r\n      Âtmâ.\r\n\r\n 1443 _The Gnostics and their Remains_, pp. 37, 38.\r\n\r\n 1444 _Rig Veda_, iii. 54. 16; ii. 29. 3, 4.\r\n\r\n 1445 Prof. Roth (in Peter’s Lexicon) defines the Angirasas as an\r\n      intermediate race of higher Beings between Gods and Men; while Prof.\r\n      Weber, according to his invariable custom of modernizing and\r\n      anthropomorphizing the divine, sees in them the original priests of\r\n      the religion which was common to the Âryan Hindûs and Persians. Roth\r\n      is right. “Angirasas” was one of the names of the Dhyânîs, or Deva‐\r\n      Instructors (Guru‐Devas), of the late Third, the Fourth, and even of\r\n      the Fifth Race Initiates.\r\n\r\n 1446 _Ibid._, x. 62. 1, 4.\r\n\r\n 1447 _Ibid._, x. 90. 1.\r\n\r\n 1448 _Ibid._, x. 90. 5.\r\n\r\n 1449 _Rig Veda_, x. 113. 5.\r\n\r\n 1450 _Ibid._, i. 35. 8.\r\n\r\n 1451 _Ibid._, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n 1452 _Ibid._, ix. 86. 29.\r\n\r\n 1453 Only three submerged, or otherwise destroyed, Continents—for the\r\n      first Continent of the First Race exists to this day and will\r\n      prevail to the last—are described in the Occult Doctrine, the\r\n      Hyperborean, the Lemurian (adopting a name now known in Science),\r\n      and the Atlantean. Most of Asia issued from under the waters after\r\n      the destruction of Atlantis; Africa came still later, while Europe\r\n      is the fifth and the latest continent—portions of the two Americas\r\n      being far older. But of these, more anon. The Initiates who recorded\r\n      the _Vedas_—or the Rishis of our Fifth Race—wrote at a time when\r\n      Atlantis had already gone down. Atlantis is the _fourth_ Continent\r\n      that _appeared_, but the _third_ that _disappeared_.\r\n\r\n 1454 Compare Vishvakarman.\r\n\r\n 1455 _Ibid._, x. 20. 1, 16.\r\n\r\n 1456 Nor is this Archaic Teaching so very _unscientific_, since one of\r\n      the greatest Naturalists of the age—the late Professor\r\n      Agassiz—admitted the multiplicity of the geographical origins of\r\n      man, and supported it to the end of his life. The unity of the human\r\n      species was accepted by the illustrious Professor of Cambridge\r\n      (U.S.A.) in the same way as it is by the Occultists—namely, in the\r\n      sense of their essential and original homogeneity and their origin\r\n      from one and the same source, _e.g._, Negroes, Âryans, Mongols,\r\n      etc., have all originated in the same way and from the same\r\n      ancestors. These latter were all of one essence, though\r\n      differentiated, since they belonged to seven planes which differed\r\n      in degree though not in kind. That original physical difference was\r\n      only a little more accentuated by that of geographical and climatic\r\n      conditions, later on. This is not the theory of Agassiz, of course,\r\n      but the Esoteric version. It is fully discussed in the Addenda, Part\r\n      III.\r\n\r\n 1457 See the enumeration of the seven Spheres—not the “Karshvare of the\r\n      earth,” as generally believed—in Fargard xix. 30, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n 1458 The seven Worlds are, as has been said, the seven Spheres of the\r\n      Chain, each presided over by one of the seven “Great Gods” of every\r\n      religion. When the religions became degraded and anthropomorphized,\r\n      and the metaphysical ideas nearly forgotten, the synthesis or the\r\n      highest, the seventh, was separated from the rest, and that\r\n      personification became the _eighth_ God, whom Monotheism tried to\r\n      unify but—failed. In no exoteric religion is God really one, if\r\n      analyzed metaphysically.\r\n\r\n 1459 The six invisible Globes of our Chain are both “Worlds” and “Earths”\r\n      as is our own, although invisible. But where could be the _six_\r\n      invisible Earths on _this_ Globe?\r\n\r\n 1460 _Vendîdâd_, S. B.

Because the\r\n      whole world has been pervaded by the energy of the deity, he is\r\n      entitled Vishnu, from the root Vish, ‘to enter,’ or ‘’pervade’; for\r\n      all the gods, the Manus, the seven Rishis, the sons of the Manus,\r\n      the Indras, the sovereigns of the gods, all are but the impersonated\r\n      might [Vibhûtayah, potencies] of Vishnu.” (_Ibid._, iii. 18, 19.)\r\n      Vishnu is the Universe; and the Universe itself is divided in the\r\n      _Rig Veda_ into _seven_ regions—which ought to be sufficient\r\n      authority, for the Brâhmans at all events.\r\n\r\n 1468 _Ibid._, iii. 15.\r\n\r\n 1469 Hymn xix. 53.\r\n\r\n 1470 Vishnu is _all_—the worlds, the stars, the seas, etc. Vishnu “is all\r\n      that is, all that is not.... [But] he is not a substance\r\n      (Vastubhûta).” (_Vishnu Purâna_, Book II, Ch. xii; Wilson’s Trans.,\r\n      ii. 309.) “That which people call the highest God is not a substance\r\n      but the _cause_ of it; not one that is here, there, or elsewhere,\r\n      _not what we see_, but that in which all is—Space.”\r\n\r\n 1471 _Vishnu Purâna_, Wilson’s Trans., ii. 306.\r\n\r\n 1472 Therefore it is said in the _Purânas_ that the sight at night of\r\n      Dhruva, the polar star, and of the celestial Porpoise (Shishumâra, a\r\n      constellation) “expiates whatever sin has been committed during the\r\n      day.” (_Ibid._, p. 306.) The fact is that the rays of the four stars\r\n      in the “circle of perpetual apparition”—the Agni, Mahendra,\r\n      Kashyapa, and Dhruva, placed in the tail of Ursa Minor\r\n      (Shishumâra)—focussed in a certain way and on a certain object,\r\n      produce extraordinary results. The Astro‐magians of India will\r\n      understand what is meant.\r\n\r\n 1473 _Ibid._, iii. 15.\r\n\r\n 1474 Dowson’s _Hindû Classical Dictionary_, _sub voc._ “Shiva,” p. 298.\r\n\r\n 1475 _Vishnu Purâna_, _op. cit._, ii. 78.\r\n\r\n 1476 In the _Râmâyana_ it is Bâla‐Râma, Krishna’s elder brother, who does\r\n      this.\r\n\r\n 1477 With regard to the origin of Rudra, it is stated in several\r\n      _Purânas_ that his (spiritual) progeny, _created in him by Brahmâ_,\r\n      is not confined to either the _seven_ Kumâras or the _eleven_\r\n      Rudras, etc., but “comprehends infinite numbers of beings _in person\r\n      and equipments like their_ (virgin) father. Alarmed at their\r\n      fierceness, numbers, and _immortality_, Brahmâ desires his son Rudra\r\n      to form creatures of a different and mortal nature.” Rudra _refusing\r\n      to create_, desists, etc., hence Rudra is the first _rebel_.\r\n      (_Linga_, _Vâyu_, _Matsya_, and other _Purânas_.)\r\n\r\n 1478 Diti is shown to have been thus frustrated in the Dvâpara Yuga,\r\n      during that period when the Fourth Race was flourishing.\r\n\r\n 1479 Notwithstanding the terrible, and evidently _purposed_, confusion of\r\n      Manus, Rishis, and their progeny in the _Purânas_, one thing is made\r\n      clear: there have been and there will be seven Rishis in every Root‐\r\n      Race, called also Manvantara in the sacred books, just as there are\r\n      fourteen Manus in every Round, the presiding Gods, the Rishis and\r\n      sons of the Manus, being identical. (See _Vishnu Purâna_, III. i;\r\n      Wilson’s Trans., iii. 19.) Six Manvantaras are given, the seventh\r\n      being our own, in the _Vishnu Purâna_. The _Vâyu Purâna_ furnishes\r\n      the nomenclature of the sons of the fourteen Manus in every\r\n      Manvantara, and the sons of the seven Sages or Rishis. The latter\r\n      are the progeny of the Progenitors of mankind. All the _Purânas_\r\n      speak of the seven Prajâpatis of this period or Round.\r\n\r\n 1480 “Châkshusha was the Manu of the sixth period [Third Round and Third\r\n      Race], in which Indra was Manojava”—Mantradruma in the _Bhâgavata\r\n      Purâna_. (_Vishnu Purâna_, Wilson’s Trans., iii. 12.) As there is a\r\n      perfect analogy between the Great Round (Mahâkalpa), each of the\r\n      seven Rounds, and each of the seven great Races in every one of the\r\n      Rounds—therefore, Indra of the sixth period, or Third Round,\r\n      corresponds to the close of the Third Race, at the time of the Fall\r\n      or the separation of sexes. Rudra, as the father of the Maruts, has\r\n      many points of contact with Indra, the Marutvân, or “Lord of the\r\n      Maruts.” Rudra is said to have received his name because of his\r\n      weeping. Hence Brahmâ called him Rudra; but _he wept yet seven times\r\n      more and so obtained seven other names_—of which he uses one during\r\n      _each_ “period.”\r\n\r\n 1481 _Ibid._, ii. 231.\r\n\r\n 1482 In _Vishnu Puranâ_, Book II. Chap. iv. (Wilson, ii. 205), it is\r\n      stated that the “Earth,” “with its continents, mountains, oceans,\r\n      and exterior shell, is _fifty crores_ [five hundred millions] of\r\n      Yojanas in extent”; to which the translator remarks: “_This\r\n      comprises the planetary spheres_; for the diameter of the seven\r\n      zones and oceans—each ocean being of the same diameter as the\r\n      continent it encloses, and each successive continent being twice the\r\n      diameter of that which precedes it—amounts to but two crores or\r\n      fifty‐four lakhs.... ‘Whenever any contradictions in different\r\n      Purânas are observed, they are to be ascribed ... to differences of\r\n      Kalpas and _the like_.’ ” “The like” ought to read “occult meaning,”\r\n      an explanation which is withheld by the commentator, who wrote for\r\n      exoteric, _sectarian_ purposes, and was misunderstood by the\r\n      translator for various other reasons, the least of which\r\n      is—ignorance of the Esoteric Philosophy.\r\n\r\n 1483 The Phœnix, although generally connected with the Solar Cycle of 600\r\n      years—the Western cycle of the Greeks and other nations—is a generic\r\n      symbol for several kinds of cycles, ciphers being taken out or more\r\n      added according to which cycle is meant.\r\n\r\n 1484 See _Book of Ali_, Russian transl.\r\n\r\n 1485 The tense is past, because the book is allegorical, and has to veil\r\n      the truths it contains.\r\n\r\n 1486 _Oriental Collections_, ii. 119; quoted by Kenealy, _op. cit._, pp.\r\n      175, 176.\r\n\r\n 1487 _Ibid._, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n 1488 _Op. cit._, xvii. 9, 10.\r\n\r\n 1489 Section VI; _Leviticus_, xxiii. 15, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n 1490 _Vie de Notre Seigneur Jésus‐Christ_, Introduction; quoted by De\r\n      Mirville, _Pneumatologie_, iv. 50.\r\n\r\n 1491 See Suidas, _sub voc._ Ἥλιος.\r\n\r\n 1492 Pliny, _Hist.

V._,\r\n      vii. 99, 1; _cf._ i. 155, 5). It is the Divo Rajah, or the “sky,” as\r\n      they think it. But it is something besides this in Occultism. The\r\n      sentence, _pâreshu gûhyeshu vrateshu_ (_cf._, i. 155, 3, and ix. 75,\r\n      2, or again, x. 114), in _Atharva Veda_, has yet to be explained.\r\n\r\n 1501 _Medical Review_, July, 1844.\r\n\r\n 1502 H. Grattan Guinness, F.R.G.S., in his _Approaching End of the Age_,\r\n      p. 258.\r\n\r\n 1503 _Lancet_, 1842, 1843.\r\n\r\n 1504 Having given a number of illustrations from natural history, the\r\n      doctor adds: “The facts I have briefly glanced at are general facts,\r\n      _and cannot happen day after day in so many millions of animals of\r\n      every kind_. FROM THE LARVA OR OVUM OF A MINUTE INSECT UP TO MAN,\r\n      _at definite periods_, from a mere _chance or coincidence_.... Upon\r\n      the whole it is, I think, impossible to come to any less general\r\n      conclusion than this, that, _in animals, changes occur every three\r\n      and a half, seven, fourteen, twenty‐one, or twenty‐eight days, or at\r\n      some definite number of weeks_”—or septenary cycles. Again, the same\r\n      Dr. Laycock states that: “Whatever type the fever may exhibit,\r\n      _there will be a paroxysm on the seventh day.... fourteenth will be\r\n      remarkable as a day of amendment_ ... [either cure or death taking\r\n      place]. If the fourth [paroxysm] be severe, and the fifth less so,\r\n      the disease will end at the _seventh_ paroxysm, and ... the change\r\n      for the better ... will be seen on the fourteenth day ... namely,\r\n      about three or four o’clock a.m., when the system is most languid.”\r\n      (_Approaching End of the Age_, by Grattan Guinness, pp. 258 to 269,\r\n      wherein this is quoted).\r\n\r\n      This is pure “soothsaying” by cyclic calculations, and it is\r\n      connected with Chaldæan Astrolatry and Astrology. Thus Materialistic\r\n      Science—in its medicine, _the most materialistic of all_—applies our\r\n      Occult laws to diseases, studies natural history with its help,\r\n      recognizes its presence as a fact in Nature, and yet must needs\r\n      pooh‐pooh the same archaic knowledge when claimed by the Occultists.\r\n      For if the mysterious Septenary Cycle is a law in Nature, _and it is\r\n      one_, as proven; if it is found controlling both evolution and\r\n      _involution_ (or death) in the realms of entomology, ichthyology and\r\n      ornithology, as in the kingdom of the animal mammalia and man—why\r\n      cannot it be present and acting in Kosmos, in general, in its\r\n      natural (though occult) divisions of time, races, and _mental_\r\n      development? And why, furthermore, should not the most ancient\r\n      Adepts have studied and thoroughly mastered these cyclic laws under\r\n      all their aspects? Indeed, Dr. Stratton states as a physiological\r\n      and pathological fact, that “in health the human pulse is more\r\n      frequent in the morning than in the evening for six days out of\r\n      seven; and that on the _seventh_ day it is slower.” (_Edinburgh\r\n      Medical and Surgical Journal_, Jan. 1843; _ibid., loc. cit._) Why,\r\n      then, should not an Occultist show the same in cosmic and\r\n      terrestrial life in the pulse of the Planet and Races? Dr. Laycock\r\n      divides life by _three_ great _septenary_ periods; the first and\r\n      last, each stretching over 21 years, and the central period or prime\r\n      of life lasting 28 years, or four times seven. He subdivides the\r\n      first into _seven_ distinct stages, and the other two into _three_\r\n      minor periods, and says that: “The fundamental unit of the greater\r\n      periods is _one week of seven days_, _each day being twelve hours_,\r\n      and that single and compound _multiples_ of this unit, determine the\r\n      length of these periods by the same ratio, as multiples of the unit\r\n      of twelve hours determine the lesser periods. _This law binds all\r\n      periodic vital phenomena together, and links the periods observed in\r\n      the lowest annulose animals, with those of man himself, the highest\r\n      of the vertebrata._” (_Ibid._, p. 267.) If Science does this, why\r\n      should she scorn the Occult information, that—to use Dr. Laycock’s\r\n      language—_one_ Week of the Manvantaric (Lunar) Fortnight, of\r\n      fourteen Days (or seven Manus), that Fortnight of twelve Hours in a\r\n      Day representing seven Periods or seven Races—is now passed? This\r\n      language of Science fits our Doctrine admirably. Mankind _has_ lived\r\n      over “_a week of seven days_, each day being _twelve hours_,” since\r\n      three and a half Races are now gone for ever, the Fourth is\r\n      submerged, and we are now in the Fifth Race.\r\n\r\n 1505 _Op. cit._, p. 269.\r\n\r\n 1506 See for the length of such cycles or Yugas in _Vriddha Garga_ and\r\n      other ancient astronomical sections (Jyotisha). They vary from the\r\n      cycle of five years—which Colebrooke calls “the cycle of the Vedas,”\r\n      specified in the institutes of Parâshara, “and the basis of\r\n      calculation for larger cycles” (_Miscell. Essays_, i. 106 and\r\n      108)—up to the Mahâ Yuga or the famous cycle of 4,320,000 years.\r\n\r\n 1507 The Hebrew word for “week” is _seven_; and any length of time\r\n      divided by _seven_ would have been a “week” with them—even\r\n      49,000,000 years, as it is seven times seven millions. But their\r\n      calculation is throughout septiform.\r\n\r\n 1508 Brahmâ creates in the first Kalpa, or on the first Day, various\r\n      “sacrificial animals” (Pashavah), or the celestial bodies and the\r\n      Zodiacal signs, and “plants,” _which_ he uses in _sacrifices_ at the\r\n      opening of Tretâ Yuga. The Esoteric meaning shows him proceeding\r\n      cyclically and creating astral Prototypes on the _descending_\r\n      spiritual arc and then on the _ascending_ physical arc. The latter\r\n      is the subdivision of a _two‐fold_ creation, sub‐divided again into\r\n      seven descending and seven ascending degrees of Spirit falling, and\r\n      of Matter ascending; the inverse of what takes place—as in a mirror\r\n      which reflects the right on the left side—in this Manvantara of\r\n      ours. It is the same Esoterically in the Elohistic _Genesis_ (chap.\r\n      i), and in the Jehovistic copy, as in Hindû cosmogony.\r\n\r\n 1509 _Op. cit._, vv. 70, 71, 80; _The Kabbalah Unveiled_, S. L. MacGregor\r\n      Mathers, pp. 120, 121.\r\n\r\n 1510 “The Greater Holy Assembly,” v. 1,160.\r\n\r\n 1511 See _Vishnu Purâna_, I. v.\r\n\r\n 1512 It is very surprising to see theologians and Oriental scholars\r\n      expressing indignation at the “depraved taste” of the Hindû mystics,\r\n      who, not content with having “invented” the Mind‐born Sons of\r\n      Brahmâ, make the Rishis, Manus, and Prajâpatis of every kind spring\r\n      from _various parts of the body_ of their primal Progenitor, Brahmâ.\r\n      (See Wilson’s footnote in his _Vishnu Purâna_, i. 102.) Because the\r\n      average public is unacquainted with the Kabalah, the key to, and\r\n      glossary of, the much veiled Mosaic Books, therefore, the clergy\r\n      imagines the truth will never out. Let any one turn to the English,\r\n      Hebrew, or Latin texts of the _Kabalah_, now so ably translated by\r\n      several scholars, and he will find that the Tetragrammaton, which is\r\n      the Hebrew IHVH, is also both the “Sephirothal Tree”—_i.e._, it\r\n      contains all the Sephiroth except Kether, the crown—and the united\r\n      Body of the Heavenly Man (Adam Kadmon) from whose Limbs emanate the\r\n      Universe and everything in it. Furthermore, he will find that the\r\n      idea in the Kabalistic Books, the chief of which in the _Zohar_ are\r\n      the “Book of Concealed Mystery,” and of the “Greater” and the\r\n      “Lesser Holy Assembly,” is entirely phallic and far more crudely\r\n      expressed than is the four‐fold Brahmâ in any of the _Purânas_. (See\r\n      _The Kabbalah Unveiled_, by S. L. MacGregor Mathers, chapter xxii.\r\n      of “The Lesser Holy Assembly,” concerning the remaining members of\r\n      Microprosopus.) For, this “Tree of Life” is also the “Tree of\r\n      Knowledge of Good and Evil,” whose chief mystery is that of human\r\n      procreation. It is a mistake to regard the _Kabalah_ as _explaining_\r\n      the mysteries of Kosmos or Nature; it explains and unveils only a\r\n      few allegories in the _Bible_, and _is more esoteric_ than is the\r\n      latter.\r\n\r\n 1513 Simplified in the English _Bible_ to: “Is the Lord [!!] among us, or\r\n      not?”\r\n\r\n 1514 Verse 83; _op. cit._, p. 121.\r\n\r\n 1515 Translators often render the word “Companion” (Angel, also Adept) by\r\n      “Rabbi,” just as the Rishis are called Gurus. The _Zohar_ is, if\r\n      possible, more occult than the _Book of Moses_; to read the “Book of\r\n      Concealed Mystery” one requires the keys furnished by the genuine\r\n      Chaldæan _Book of Numbers_, which is not extant.\r\n\r\n 1516 Verses 1152, 1158, 1159; _op. cit._, p. 254.\r\n\r\n 1517 _I Peter_, ii. 2‐5.\r\n\r\n 1518 “The Greater Holy Assembly,” vv. 1160, 1161; _op. cit._, p. 255.\r\n\r\n 1519 See pp. 445, 446, _supra_.\r\n\r\n 1520 _Op. cit._, i. 297, 2nd ed.\r\n\r\n 1521 It is. But Âgneyâstra are fiery “missile weapons,” not “edged”\r\n      weapons, as there is some difference between Shastra and Astra in\r\n      Sanskrit.\r\n\r\n 1522 Yet there are some, who may know something of these, even outside\r\n      the author’s lines, wide as they undeniably are.\r\n\r\n 1523 This connecting link, like others, was pointed out by the present\r\n      writer nine years before the appearance of the work from which the\r\n      above is quoted, namely in _Isis Unveiled_, a work full of such\r\n      guiding links between ancient, mediæval, and modern thought, but,\r\n      unfortunately, too loosely edited.\r\n\r\n 1524 Ay; but how can the learned writer prove that these “beginnings”\r\n      were precisely in Egypt, and nowhere else; and only 50,000 years\r\n      ago?\r\n\r\n 1525 Precisely; and this is just what the Theosophists do. They have\r\n      never claimed “original inspiration,” not even as mediums claim it,\r\n      but have always pointed, and do now point, to the “primary\r\n      signification” of the symbols, which they trace to other countries,\r\n      older even than Egypt; significations, moreover, which emanate from\r\n      a Hierarchy (or Hierarchies, if preferred) of _living_ Wise\r\n      Men—mortals notwithstanding that Wisdom—who reject every approach to\r\n      _supernaturalism_.\r\n\r\n 1526 But where is the proof that the Ancients did not mean precisely that\r\n      which the Theosophists claim? Records exist for what they say, just\r\n      as other records exist for what Mr. Gerald Massey says. His\r\n      interpretations are very correct, but are also very one‐sided.\r\n      Surely Nature has more than one _physical aspect_; for Astronomy,\r\n      Astrology, and so on, are all on the physical, not the spiritual,\r\n      plane.\r\n\r\n 1527 _The Natural Genesis_, i. 318. It is to be feared that Mr. Massey\r\n      has not succeeded. We have our followers as he has his followers,\r\n      and Materialistic Science steps in and takes little account of both\r\n      his and our speculations!\r\n\r\n 1528 The fact that this learned Egyptologist does not recognize in the\r\n      doctrine of the “Seven Souls,” as he terms our “principles,” or\r\n      “metaphysical ‘_concepts_,’ ” anything but “the primitive biology or\r\n      physiology of the soul,” does not invalidate our argument. The\r\n      lecturer touches on only two keys, those that unlock the\r\n      astronomical and the physiological mysteries of Esotericism, and\r\n      leaves out the other five. Otherwise he would have promptly\r\n      understood that what he calls the physiological divisions of the\r\n      living Soul of man, are regarded by Theosophists as also\r\n      psychological and spiritual.\r\n\r\n 1529 _Op. cit._, p. 2.\r\n\r\n 1530 _Ibid._, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n 1531 _Ibid._, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n 1532 _Ibid._, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n 1533 _Ibid._, p. 4.\r\n\r\n 1534 This is a great mistake made in the Esoteric enumeration. Manas is\r\n      the fifth, not the fourth; and Manas corresponds precisely with Seb,\r\n      the Egyptian fifth principle, for that portion of Manas which\r\n      follows the two higher principles, is the ancestral soul, indeed,\r\n      the bright, immortal thread of the higher Ego, to which clings the\r\n      spiritual aroma of all the lives or births.\r\n\r\n 1535 _Ibid._, p. 2.\r\n\r\n 1536 _Ibid._, pp. 2, 3.\r\n\r\n 1537 _Signatura Rerum_, xiv. pars. 10, 14, 15; _The Natural Genesis_, i.\r\n      317.\r\n\r\n 1538 _Aurora_, xxiv. 27.\r\n\r\n 1539 This is indeed news! It makes us fear that the lecturer had never\r\n      read _Esoteric Buddhism_ before criticizing it. There are too many\r\n      such misconceptions in his notices of it.\r\n\r\n 1540 “The Seven Souls of Man,” pp. 26, 27.\r\n\r\n 1541 _Ibid._, p. 26.\r\n\r\n 1542 _The Theosophist_, 1887 (Madras), pp. 705, 706.\r\n\r\n 1543 According to _Shvetâshvatara‐Upanishad_ (357) the Siddhas are those\r\n      who are possessed from birth of “superhuman” powers, as also of\r\n      “knowledge and indifference to the world.” According to the Occult\r\n      teachings, however, the Siddhas are Nirmânakâyas or the “spirits”—in\r\n      the sense of an individual, or _conscious_ spirit—of great Sages\r\n      from spheres on a higher plane than our own, who voluntarily\r\n      incarnate in mortal bodies in order to help the human race in its\r\n      upward progress. Hence their innate knowledge, wisdom and powers.\r\n\r\n 1544 “The Sacred Books of the East,” viii. 284, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n 1545 I propose to follow here the text and not the editor’s commentaries,\r\n      who accepts Arjuna Mishra and Nilakantha’s _dead‐letter_\r\n      explanations. Our Orientalists never trouble to think that if a\r\n      native commentator is a non‐initiate, he could not explain\r\n      correctly, and if an Initiate, would not.\r\n\r\n 1546 See _Chhândogya_, p. 219, and Shankara’s commentary thereupon.\r\n\r\n 1547 The editor explains here, saying, “I presume devoted to the\r\n      Brahman.” We venture to assert that the “Fire” or Self is the real\r\n      Higher SELF “connected with,” that is to say _one_ with Brahma, the\r\n      One Deity. The “Self” separates itself no longer from the Universal\r\n      Spirit.\r\n\r\n 1548 The “Supreme Self,” says Krishna, in the _Bhagavad Gitâ_, pp. 102,\r\n      _et seqq._\r\n\r\n 1549 As Mahat, or Universal Intelligence, is first born, or manifests, as\r\n      Vishnu, and then, when it falls into Matter and develops self‐\r\n      consciousness, becomes egoism, selfishness, so Manas is of a dual\r\n      nature. It is respectively under the Sun and Moon, for as\r\n      Shankarâchârya says: “The moon is the mind, and the sun the\r\n      understanding.” The Sun and Moon are the deities of our planetary\r\n      Macrocosmos, and therefore Shankara adds that: “The mind and the\r\n      understanding are the respective deities of the [human] organs.”\r\n      (See _Brihadâranyaka_, pp. 521, _et seqq._) This is perhaps why\r\n      Arjuna Mishra says that the Moon and the Fire (the Self, the Sun)\r\n      constitute the universe.\r\n\r\n 1550 “The body in the soul,” as Arjuna Mishra is credited with saying, or\r\n      rather “the soul in the spirit”, and on a still higher plane of\r\n      development, the Self or Âtman in the Universal Self.\r\n\r\n 1551 _Op. cit._, p. 179.\r\n\r\n 1552 _Prov._, ix. 1.\r\n\r\n 1553 De Quatrefages, _The Human Species_, p. 111. The respective\r\n      developments of the human and simian brains are referred to. “In the\r\n      ape the temporo‐sphenoidal convolutions, which form the middle lobe,\r\n      make their appearance and are completed before the anterior\r\n      convolutions which form the frontal lobe. In man, on the contrary,\r\n      the frontal convolutions are the first to appear, and those of the\r\n      middle lobe are formed later.” (_Ibid._)\r\n\r\n 1554 _Doctrine of Descent and Darwinism_, p. 290.\r\n\r\n 1555 Series II, Vol. VI, p. 769 (Ed. 1886). To this an editorial remark\r\n      adds that an “F.J.B.,” in the _Athenæum_ (No. 3069, Aug. 21, 1886,\r\n      pp. 242‐3), points out that Naturalists have long recognized that\r\n      there are “morphological” and “physiological” species. The former\r\n      have their origin in men’s minds, the latter in a series of changes\r\n      sufficient to affect the internal as well as the external organs of\r\n      a group of allied individuals. The “physiological selection” of\r\n      morphological species is a confusion of ideas; that of physiological\r\n      species a redundancy of terms.\r\n\r\n 1556 _Op. cit._, p. 79.\r\n\r\n 1557 _Ibid._, p. 48.\r\n\r\n 1558 Nägeli’s “principle of perfectibility”; von de Baer’s “striving\r\n      towards the purpose”; Braun’s “divine breath as the inward impulse\r\n      in the evolutionary history of Nature”; Professor Owen’s “tendency\r\n      to perfectibility,” etc., are all expressive of the veiled\r\n      manifestations of the universal guiding Fohat, rich with the Divine\r\n      and Dhyân‐Chohanic thought.\r\n\r\n 1559 Hæckel on “Cell‐Souls and Soul‐Cells,” _Pedigree of Man_, Aveling’s\r\n      Trans., see pp. 136, 150.\r\n\r\n 1560 See _infra_, M. de Quatrefages’ _exposé_ of Hæckel, in Section II,\r\n      “The Ancestors Mankind is offered by Science.”\r\n\r\n 1561 Strictly speaking, du Bois‐Reymond is an Agnostic, and not a\r\n      Materialist. He has protested most vehemently against the\r\n      materialistic doctrine, which affirms mental phenomena to be merely\r\n      the product of molecular motion. The most accurate _physiological_\r\n      knowledge of the structure of the brain leaves us “nothing but\r\n      matter in motion,” he asserts; “_we must go further_, and admit the\r\n      utterly incomprehensible nature of the psychical principle, which it\r\n      is _impossible to regard_ as a mere outcome of material causes.”\r\n\r\n 1562 See Hæckel’s “Present Position of Evolution,” _op. cit._, pp. 23,\r\n      24, 296, 297, notes.\r\n\r\n 1563 _Op. cit._, pp. 34, 35, 36.\r\n\r\n 1564 _Measure for Measure_, Act ii, Scene 2.\r\n\r\n 1565 _Knowledge_, January, 1882.\r\n\r\n 1566 T.

In this, as has been shown in Part I, Modern\r\n      Science has again been anticipated, far beyond its own speculations,\r\n      by Archaic Science.\r\n\r\n 1572 _Ibid._, pp. 104‐106.\r\n\r\n 1573 _Anthrop._, 3rd edition, p. 11.\r\n\r\n 1574 Theosophists will remember that, according to Occult teaching,\r\n      cyclic Pralayas so‐called are but “Obscurations,” during which\r\n      periods Nature, _i.e._, everything visible and invisible on a\r\n      resting Planet—remains _in statu quo_. Nature rests and slumbers, no\r\n      work of destruction going on upon the Globe even if no active work\r\n      be done. All forms, as well as their astral types, remain as they\r\n      were at the last moment of its activity. The “Night” of a Planet has\r\n      hardly any twilight preceding it. It is caught like a huge mammoth\r\n      by an avalanche, and remains slumbering and frozen till the next\r\n      dawn of its new Day—a very short one indeed in comparison to the Day\r\n      of Brahmâ.\r\n\r\n 1575 This will be pooh‐poohed, because it will not be understood by our\r\n      modern men of Science; but every Occultist and Theosophist will\r\n      easily realize the process. There _can be no objective_ form on\r\n      Earth, nor in the Universe either, without its astral prototype\r\n      being first formed in Space. From Phidias down to the humblest\r\n      workman in the ceramic art, a sculptor has had to create first of\r\n      all a model in his mind, then sketch it in dimensional lines, and\r\n      then only can he reproduce it in a three dimensional or objective\r\n      figure. And if the human mind is a living demonstration of such\r\n      successive stages in the process of Evolution, how can it be\r\n      otherwise when Nature’s Mind and creative powers are concerned?\r\n\r\n 1576 See _A Modern Zoroastrian_, p. 103.\r\n\r\n 1577 “Darwinian Theory” in _Pedigree of Man_, p. 22.\r\n\r\n 1578 _The Age and Origin of Man._\r\n\r\n 1579 _Man before Metals_, p. 320, “International Scientific Series.”\r\n\r\n 1580 _Mr. Darwin’s Philosophy of Language_, 1873.\r\n\r\n 1581 _Cf._ his _Doctrine of Descent and Darwinism_, p. 304.\r\n\r\n 1582 _A Modern Zoroastrian_, p. 136.\r\n\r\n 1583 It thus appears that in its anxiety to prove our noble descent from\r\n      the catarrhine “baboon,” Hæckel’s school has pushed back the times\r\n      of pre‐historic man millions of years. (See _Pedigree of Man_, p.\r\n      273.) Occultists, render thanks to Science for such corroboration of\r\n      our claims!\r\n\r\n 1584 This seems a poor compliment to pay Geology, which is not a\r\n      speculative but as exact a Science as Astronomy—save, perhaps, its\r\n      too risky chronological speculations. It is mainly a “descriptive”\r\n      as opposed to an “abstract” Science.\r\n\r\n 1585 Such newly‐coined words as “perigenesis of plastids,” “plastidule\r\n      souls” (!), and others less comely, invented by Hæckel, may be very\r\n      learned and correct in so far as they may express very graphically\r\n      the ideas in his own vivid fancy. As _facts_, however, they remain\r\n      for his less imaginative colleagues painfully cænogenetic—to use his\r\n      own terminology; _i.e._, for true Science they are spurious\r\n      speculations, so long as they are derived from “empirical sources.”\r\n      Therefore, when he seeks to prove that “the origin of man from other\r\n      mammals, and most directly from the catarrhine apes, is a deductive\r\n      law, that follows necessarily from the inductive law of the theory\r\n      of descent” (_Anthropogeny_, p. 392, quoted in _Pedigree of Man_, p.\r\n      295.)—his no less learned foes (du Bois‐Reymond—for one) have a\r\n      right to see in this sentence a mere jugglery of words; a\r\n      “_testimonium paupertatis_ of Natural Science”—as he himself\r\n      complains, speaking, in return, of du Bois‐Reymond’s “astonishing\r\n      ignorance.” (See _Pedigree of Man_, notes on pp. 295, 296.)\r\n\r\n 1586 _Pedigree of Man_, p. 273.\r\n\r\n 1587 _Anthropogeny_, p. 392. Quoted in _Pedigree of Man_, p. 295.\r\n\r\n 1588 The _mental_ barrier between man and ape, characterized by Huxley as\r\n      an “enormous gap, a distance practically immeasurable” (! !) is,\r\n      indeed, in itself conclusive. Certainly it constitutes a standing\r\n      puzzle to the Materialist, who relies on the frail reed of “natural\r\n      selection.” The physiological differences between Man and the Apes\r\n      are in reality—despite a curious community of certain\r\n      features—equally striking. Says Dr. Schweinfurth, one of the most\r\n      cautious and experienced of Naturalists:\r\n\r\n      “In modern times there are no animals in creation that have\r\n      attracted a larger amount of attention from the scientific student\r\n      of nature than these great quadrumana [the anthropoids], which are\r\n      stamped with such a singular resemblance to the human form as to\r\n      have justified the epithet of anthropomorphic.... But all\r\n      investigation at present only leads human intelligence to a\r\n      confession of its insufficiency; and nowhere is caution more to be\r\n      advocated, nowhere is premature judgment more to be deprecated than\r\n      in the attempt to bridge over the mysterious chasm which separates\r\n      man and beast.” (_Heart of Africa_, i., 520.

A ridiculous instance of\r\n      evolutionist contradictions is afforded by Schmidt (_Doctrine of\r\n      Descent and Darwinism_, p. 292). He says: “Man’s kinship with the\r\n      apes is ... not impugned by the bestial strength of the teeth of a\r\n      male orang or gorilla.” Mr. Darwin, on the contrary, endows this\r\n      fabulous being with teeth used as weapons!\r\n\r\n 1590 According even to a fellow‐thinker, Professor Schmidt, Darwin has\r\n      evolved “a certainly not flattering, and perhaps in many points not\r\n      correct, portrait of our presumptive ancestors in the phase of\r\n      dawning humanity.” (_Doctrine of Descent and Darwinism_, p. 284.)\r\n\r\n 1591 _The Human Species_, pp. 106‐108.\r\n\r\n 1592 _Op. cit._, p. 77.\r\n\r\n 1593 Pp. 109, 110.\r\n\r\n 1594 _Op. cit._, p. 110.\r\n\r\n 1595 Of course the Esoteric system of Fourth Round Evolution is much more\r\n      complex than the paragraph and quotations referred to categorically\r\n      assert. It is practically a _reversal_—both in embryological\r\n      inference and succession in time of species—of the current Western\r\n      conception.\r\n\r\n 1596 According to Hæckel, there are also “cell‐souls” and “atom‐cells”;\r\n      an “inorganic molecular soul” without, and a “plastidular soul”\r\n      with, or possessing, memory. What are our Esoteric teachings to\r\n      this? The _divine and human_ soul of the seven principles in man\r\n      must, of course, pale and give way before such a stupendous\r\n      revelation!\r\n\r\n 1597 _The Pedigree of Man_, p. 296.\r\n\r\n 1598 A valuable confession, this. Only it makes the attempt to trace the\r\n      _descent_ of consciousness in man, as well as of his physical body,\r\n      from Bathybius Hæckelii, still more humorous and _empirical_ in the\r\n      sense of Webster’s second definition.\r\n\r\n 1599 _Ibid._\r\n\r\n 1600 Those who take the opposite view and look upon the existence of the\r\n      human Soul—“as a supernatural, a spiritual phenomenon, conditioned\r\n      by forces altogether different from ordinary physical forces,” mock,\r\n      he thinks, “in consequence, all explanation that is simply\r\n      scientific.” They have no right it seems, to assert that “psychology\r\n      is, in part, or in whole, a spiritual science, not a physical one.”\r\n      The new discovery by Hæckel—one taught for thousands of years in all\r\n      the Eastern religions, however—that animals have souls, will, and\r\n      sensation, hence, soul‐functions, leads him to make of Psychology\r\n      the science of the Zoologists. The archaic teaching that the “soul”\r\n      (the animal and human souls, or Kâma and Manas) “has its\r\n      developmental history”—is claimed by Hæckel as his own discovery and\r\n      innovation on an “untrodden [?] path”! He, Hæckel, will work out the\r\n      comparative evolution of the soul in man and in other animals. The\r\n      comparative morphology of the soul‐organs, and the comparative\r\n      physiology of the soul‐functions, both founded on Evolution, thus\r\n      become the psychological [really materialistic] problem of the\r\n      scientific man. (“Cell‐souls and Soul‐cells,” pp. 135, 136, 137,\r\n      _Pedigree of Man_.)\r\n\r\n 1601 _The Pedigree of Man_, note 20, p. 296.\r\n\r\n 1602 P. 119.\r\n\r\n 1603 See “Transmigration of Life‐Atoms,” in _Five Years of Theosophy_,\r\n      pp. 533‐539. The collective aggregation of these atoms forms thus\r\n      the Anima Mundi of our Solar System, the Soul of our little\r\n      Universe, each atom of which is of course a Soul, a Monad, a little\r\n      universe endowed with consciousness, hence with memory. (Vol. I,\r\n      Part III, “Gods, Monads, and Atoms.”)\r\n\r\n 1604 _Op. cit._, p. 119.\r\n\r\n 1605 In “The Transmigration of Life‐Atoms” (_Five Years of Theosophy_, p.\r\n      535), we say of the Jîva, or Life‐Principle, in order to better\r\n      explain a position which is but too often misunderstood: “It is\r\n      omnipresent ... though [on this plane of manifestation often] ... in\r\n      a dormant state [as in stone].... The definition which states that\r\n      when this indestructible force is ‘disconnected with one set of\r\n      atoms [_molecules_ ought to have been said] it becomes immediately\r\n      attracted by others,’ does not imply that it abandons entirely the\r\n      first set [because the atoms themselves would then disappear], but\r\n      only that it transfers its _vis viva_, or living power—the energy of\r\n      motion, to another set. But because it manifests itself in the next\r\n      set as what is called kinetic energy, it does not follow that the\r\n      first set is deprived of it altogether; for it is still in it, as\r\n      potential energy or life latent.” Now what can Hæckel mean by his\r\n      “not identical atoms, but their peculiar motion and mode of\r\n      aggregation,” if it is not the same kinetic energy we have been\r\n      explaining? Before evolving such theories, he must have read\r\n      Paracelsus and studied _Five Years of Theosophy_ without properly\r\n      digesting the teachings.\r\n\r\n 1606 _Op. cit._, note 21, p. 296.\r\n\r\n 1607 _Ibid._, note 19.\r\n\r\n 1608 _Ibid._, note 23.\r\n\r\n 1609 _Man’s Place in Nature_, p. 159.\r\n\r\n 1610 _Op cit._, p. 157.\r\n\r\n 1611 _Ibid._, p. 161.\r\n\r\n 1612 This the way _primitive man_ must have acted? We are not aware of\r\n      men, not even of savages, in our age, who are known to have imitated\r\n      the apes which lived side by side with them in the forests of\r\n      America and the islands. But we do know of large apes who, tamed and\r\n      living in houses, will mimic men to the length of donning hats and\r\n      coats. The writer once had a chimpanzee who, without being taught,\r\n      opened a newspaper and pretended to read it. It is the descending\r\n      generations, the children, who mimic their parents—not the reverse.\r\n\r\n 1613 _Ibid._, p. 151.\r\n\r\n 1614 It is asked, whether it would change one iota of the scientific\r\n      truth and fact contained in the above sentence if it were to read:\r\n      “the ape is simply an instance of the biped type specialized for\r\n      going on all fours generally, and with a smaller brain.”\r\n      Esoterically speaking, this is the real truth, and not the reverse.\r\n\r\n 1615 _Modern Science and Modern Thought_, pp. 151, 152.\r\n\r\n 1616 We cannot follow Mr. Laing here. When avowed Darwinists like Huxley\r\n      point to “the great gulf which intervenes between the lowest ape and\r\n      the highest man in intellectual power,” the “enormous gulf ...\r\n      between them,” the “immeasurable and practically infinite divergence\r\n      of the human from the simian stirps” (_Man’s Place in Nature_, p.\r\n      102 and note); when even the physical basis of mind—the brain—so\r\n      _vastly_ exceeds in size that of the highest existing apes; when men\r\n      like Wallace are forced to invoke the agency of extra‐terrestrial\r\n      intelligences in order to explain the rise of such a creature as the\r\n      pithecanthropus alalus, or speechless savage of Hæckel, to the level\r\n      of the large‐brained and _moral_ man of to‐day—when all this is the\r\n      case, it is idle to dismiss evolutionist puzzles so lightly. If the\r\n      _structural_ evidence is so unconvincing and, taken as a whole, so\r\n      hostile to Darwinism, the difficulties as to the “how” of the\r\n      evolution of the human _mind_ by natural selection are tenfold\r\n      greater.\r\n\r\n 1617 A race which MM. de Quatrefages and Hamy regard as a branch of the\r\n      same stock whence the Canary Island Guanches sprung—offshoots of the\r\n      Atlanteans, in short.\r\n\r\n 1618 _Ibid._, pp. 180‐182.\r\n\r\n 1619 _Pedigree of Man_, p. 73.\r\n\r\n 1620 Professor Owen believes that these muscles—the attollens, retrahens,\r\n      and attrahens aurem—were actively functioning in men of the Stone\r\n      age. This may or may not be the case. The question falls under the\r\n      ordinary “occult” explanation, and involves no postulate of an\r\n      “animal progenitor” to solve it.\r\n\r\n 1621 _Man’s Place in Nature_, p. 104. To cite another good authority: “We\r\n      find one of the most man‐like apes (gibbon) in the Tertiary period,\r\n      and this species is _still in the same low grade_, and _side by\r\n      side_ with it at the end of the Ice period, man is found in the same\r\n      high grade as to‐day, the ape not having approximated more nearly to\r\n      the man, and modern man not having become further removed from the\r\n      ape than the first (fossil) man ... these facts contradict a theory\r\n      of constant progressive development.” (Pfaff.) When, according to\r\n      Vogt, the average Australian brain = 99·35 cub. inches; that of the\r\n      gorilla 30·51, and that of the chimpanzee only 25·45, the _giant\r\n      gap_ to be bridged by the advocate of “Natural” Selection becomes\r\n      apparent.\r\n\r\n 1622 Geo. T. Curtis, _Creation or Evolution?_ p. 76.\r\n\r\n 1623 “At this period,” writes Darwin, “the arteries run in arch‐like\r\n      branches, as if to carry the blood to branchiæ which are not present\r\n      in the higher vertebrata, though the slits on the side of the neck\r\n      still remain, marking their former [?] position.”\r\n\r\n      It is noteworthy that, though gill‐clefts are absolutely useless to\r\n      all but amphibia and fishes, etc., their appearance is regularly\r\n      noted in the fœtal development of vertebrates. Even children are\r\n      occasionally born with an opening in the neck corresponding to one\r\n      of the clefts.\r\n\r\n 1624 Those who with Hæckel regard the gill‐clefts with their attendant\r\n      phenomena as illustrative of an active function in our amphibian and\r\n      piscine ancestors (see his twelfth and thirteenth stages), ought to\r\n      explain why the “vegetable with leaflets” (Prof. André Lefèvre)\r\n      represented in fœtal growth, does not appear in his twenty‐two\r\n      stages through which the Monera have passed in their ascent to Man.\r\n      Hæckel does _not_ postulate a _vegetable_ ancestor. The\r\n      embryological argument is thus a two‐edged sword and here cuts its\r\n      possessor.\r\n\r\n 1625 Lefèvre, _Philosophy Historical and Critical_, pt. ii. p. 480,\r\n      “Library of Contemporary Science.”\r\n\r\n 1626 We confess to not being able to see any good reasons for Mr. E.\r\n      Clodd’s positive statement in _Knowledge_. Speaking of the men of\r\n      Neolithic times, “concerning whom Mr. Grant Allen has given ... a\r\n      vivid and accurate sketch,” and who are “the direct ancestors of\r\n      peoples of whom remnants yet lurk in out‐of‐the‐way corners of\r\n      Europe, where they have been squeezed or stranded,” he adds, “but\r\n      the men of Palæolithic times can be identified with no existing\r\n      races; they were savages of a more degraded type than any extant;\r\n      tall, yet barely erect, with short legs and twisted knees, with\r\n      prognathous, that is, projecting ape‐like jaws, and small brains.\r\n      Whence they come we cannot tell, and their ‘grave knoweth no man to\r\n      this day.’ ”\r\n\r\n      Besides the possibility that there may be men who _know_ whence they\r\n      came and how they perished—it is not true to say that the\r\n      Palæolithic men, or their fossils, are all found with “small\r\n      brains.” The oldest skull of all those hitherto found, the\r\n      “Neanderthal skull,” is of average capacity, and Mr. Huxley was\r\n      compelled to confess that it was no real approximation whatever to\r\n      that of the “missing link.” There are aboriginal tribes in India\r\n      whose brains are far smaller and nearer to that of the ape than any\r\n      hitherto found among the skulls of Palæolithic man.\r\n\r\n 1627 _Antiquity of Man_, p. 246.\r\n\r\n 1628 The actual time required for such a theoretical transformation is\r\n      necessarily enormous. “If,” says Professor Pfaff, “in the hundreds\r\n      of thousands of years which you [the Evolutionists] accept between\r\n      the rise of palæolithic man and our own day, a greater distance of\r\n      man from the brute is not demonstrable [_the most ancient man was\r\n      just as far removed from the brute as the now living man_], what\r\n      reasonable ground can be advanced for believing that man has been\r\n      developed from the brute, and has receded further from it by\r\n      infinitely small gradations.... _The longer the interval of time\r\n      placed between our times and the so‐called palæolithic men, the more\r\n      ominous and destructive for the theory of the gradual development of\r\n      man from the animal kingdom is the result stated._” Huxley writes\r\n      (_Man’s Place in Nature_, p. 159) that the _most liberal_ estimates\r\n      for the antiquity of man _must be still further_ extended.\r\n\r\n 1629 _Fortnightly Review_, 1882. The baselessness of this assertion, as\r\n      well as that of many other exaggerations of the imaginative Mr.\r\n      Grant Allen, was ably exposed by the eminent Anatomist, Professor R.\r\n      Owen, in _Longman’s Magazine_, No. 1. Must it be repeated, moreover,\r\n      that the Cro‐Magnon Palæolithic type is superior to that of a very\r\n      large number of existing races?\r\n\r\n 1630 It thus stands to reason that Science would never dream of a Pre‐\r\n      Tertiary man, and that de Quatrefages’ Secondary man makes every\r\n      Academician and F.R.S. faint with horror because, to preserve the\r\n      ape‐theory, Science must make man Post‐Secondary. This is just what\r\n      de Quatrefages has twitted the Darwinists with, adding, that on the\r\n      whole there were more scientific reasons for tracing the ape from\r\n      man than man from the anthropoid. With this exception Science has\r\n      not one single valid argument to offer against the antiquity of man.\r\n      But in this case modern Evolution demands far more than the fifteen\r\n      million years of Croll for the Tertiary period, for two very simple\r\n      but good reasons: (_a_) no anthropoid ape has been found before the\r\n      Miocene period; (_b_) man’s flint relics have been traced to the\r\n      Pliocene and their presence _suspected_, if not accepted by all, in\r\n      the Miocene strata. Again, where is the “missing link” in such case?\r\n      And how could even a Palæolithic savage, a “man of Canstadt,” evolve\r\n      into a _thinking_ man from the brute dryopithecus of the Miocene _in\r\n      so short a time_? One sees now the reason why Darwin rejected the\r\n      theory that only 60,000,000 years had elapsed since the Cambrian\r\n      period. “He judges from the small amount of organic change since the\r\n      commencement of the glacial epoch, and adds that the previous 140\r\n      million years can hardly be considered as sufficient for the\r\n      development of the varied forms of life which certainly existed\r\n      toward the close of the Cambrian period.” (Ch. Gould, _Mythical\r\n      Monsters_, p. 84.)\r\n\r\n 1631 It may here be remarked that those Darwinians who, with Mr. Grant\r\n      Allen, place our “hairy arboreal” ancestors so far back as the\r\n      Eocene age, are landed in rather an awkward dilemma. No fossil\r\n      anthropoid ape—much less the fabulous common ancestor assigned to\r\n      man and the pithecoid—appears in Eocene strata. The first\r\n      presentment of an anthropoid ape is Miocene.\r\n\r\n 1632 Ed.

The\r\n      _unknown_ Light—with which he is said to be coëternal and coëval—is\r\n      reflected in the First‐Born, the Protogonos; and the Demiurgos or\r\n      the Universal Mind directs his Divine Thought into the Chaos that\r\n      under the fashioning of minor Gods will be divided into the Seven\r\n      Oceans—Sapta Samudras. It is Purusha, Ahura Mazda, Osiris, etc., and\r\n      finally the Gnostic Christos, who is in the _Kabalah_, Chokmah, or\r\n      Wisdom, the “Word.”\r\n\r\n 1657 The _form_ of Tikkun or the Protogonos, “First‐Born,” _i.e._, the\r\n      Universal Form and Idea, had not yet been mirrored in Chaos.\r\n\r\n 1658 _Zohar_, iii. 292c.

It raises, perhaps, a not ill‐founded suspicion that even our\r\n      age of scientific enlightenment may be as grossly absurd in its\r\n      materialistic negations as the men of the Middle Ages were absurd\r\n      and materialistic in their religious affirmations.\r\n\r\n 1664 _Philosophy Historical and Critical_, p. 481.\r\n\r\n 1665 Probably in excess.\r\n\r\n 1666 _Knowledge_, Art. “The Antiquity of Man in Western Europe,” March\r\n      31st, 1882.\r\n\r\n 1667 Who, in another work, _La Préhistorique Antiquité de l’Homme_, some\r\n      twenty years ago, generously allowed only 230,000 years to our\r\n      mankind! Since we learn now that he places man in the Mid‐Miocene\r\n      period, we must say that the much respected Professor of Prehistoric\r\n      Anthropology in Paris is somewhat contradictory and inconsistent, if\r\n      not _naïf_ in his views.\r\n\r\n 1668 The root and basic idea of the origin and transformation of\r\n      species—the _heredity_ of acquired faculties—seems to have found\r\n      lately very serious opponents in Germany. Du Bois‐Reymond and Dr.\r\n      Pflüger, the Physiologists, besides other men of Science as eminent\r\n      as any, find insuperable difficulties and even impossibilities in\r\n      the doctrine.\r\n\r\n 1669 _History of Creation_, p. 20.\r\n\r\n 1670 The same names are retained as those given by Science, to make the\r\n      parallels clearer. Our terms are quite different.\r\n\r\n 1671 Let the student remember that the Doctrine teaches that there are\r\n      seven degrees of Devas or “Progenitors,” or seven Classes, from the\r\n      most perfect to the less exalted.\r\n\r\n 1672 It may be said that we are inconsistent in not introducing into this\r\n      table a Primary‐age Man. The parallelism of Races and geological\r\n      periods here adopted, is, so far as the origin of the First and\r\n      Second are concerned, purely tentative, no direct information being\r\n      available. Having previously discussed the question of a possible\r\n      race in the Carboniferous age, it is needless to renew the debate.\r\n\r\n 1673 During the _interim_ between one Round and another, the Globe and\r\n      everything on it remains _in statu quo_. Remember, vegetation began\r\n      in its ethereal form before what is called the Primordial, running\r\n      through the Primary, and condensing in it, and reaching its full\r\n      physical life in the Secondary.\r\n\r\n 1674 Geologists tell us that “in the Secondary epoch, the only mammals\r\n      which have been [hitherto] discovered in Europe are the fossil\r\n      remains of a small marsupial or pouch‐bearer.” (_Knowledge_, March\r\n      31st, 1882, p. 464.) Surely the marsupial or didelphis (the only\r\n      surviving animal of the family of those which were on Earth during\r\n      the presence on it of androgyne man) cannot be the only animal that\r\n      was then on Earth? Its presence speaks loudly for that of other\r\n      (though unknown) mammals, besides the monotremes and marsupials, and\r\n      thus shows the appellation of “mammalian age” given only to the\r\n      Tertiary period to be misleading and erroneous, as it allows one to\r\n      infer that there were no mammals, but reptiles, birds, amphibians,\r\n      and fishes alone in the Mesozoic times—the Secondary.\r\n\r\n 1675 Those who feel inclined to sneer at that doctrine of Esoteric\r\n      Ethnology, which pre‐supposes the existence of Men in the Secondary\r\n      age, will do well to note the fact that one of the most\r\n      distinguished Anthropologists of the day, M. de Quatrefages,\r\n      seriously argues in that direction. He writes: “There is then\r\n      nothing impossible in the idea that he [man] ... should have\r\n      appeared upon the globe with the first representatives of the type\r\n      to which he belongs by his organization.” (_The Human Species_, p.\r\n      153.) This statement approximates most closely to our fundamental\r\n      assertion that man preceded the other mammalia.\r\n\r\n      Professor Lefèvre admits that the “labours of Boucher de Perthes,\r\n      Lartet, Christy, Bourgeois, Desnoyers, Broca, De Mortillet, Hamy,\r\n      Gaudry, Capellini, and a hundred others, have overcome all doubts,\r\n      and clearly established the progressive development of the human\r\n      organism and industries from the miocene epoch of the tertiary age.”\r\n      (_Philosophy Historical and Critical_, Pt. II, p. 499, Chapter II,\r\n      On Organic Evolution. “Library of Contemporary Science.”) Why does\r\n      he reject the possibility of a Secondary‐age man? Simply because he\r\n      is involved in the meshes of the Darwinian Anthropology. “The origin\r\n      of man is bound up with that of the higher mammals”; he appeared\r\n      “only with the _last_ types of his class”! This is not argument, but\r\n      dogmatism. Theory can never excommunicate fact. Must everything give\r\n      place to the mere working hypotheses of Western Evolutionists?\r\n      Surely not!\r\n\r\n 1676 These placentalia of the third sub‐class are divided, it appears,\r\n      into villiplacentalia (placenta composed of many separate scattered\r\n      tufts), the zonoplacentalia (girdle‐shaped placenta), and the\r\n      discoplacentalia (or discoid). Hæckel sees in the marsupialia\r\n      didelphia, one of the connecting links _genealogically_ between man\r\n      and the moneron!!\r\n\r\n 1677 This inclusion of the First Race in the Secondary is necessarily\r\n      only a provisional working hypothesis—the actual chronology of the\r\n      First, Second, and early Third Races being closely veiled by the\r\n      Initiates. For all that can be said on the subject, the First Root‐\r\n      Race may have been Pre‐Secondary, as is, indeed, taught.\r\n\r\n 1678 The above parallels stand good only if Professor Croll’s earlier\r\n      calculations are adopted, namely, of 15,000,000 years since the\r\n      beginning of the Eocene period (see Charles Gould’s _Mythical\r\n      Monsters_, p. 84), not those in his _Climate and Time_, which allow\r\n      only two‐and‐a‐half million years, or at the utmost three million\r\n      years’ duration to the Tertiary age. This, however, would make the\r\n      whole duration of the incrusted age of the world only 131,600,000\r\n      years, according to Professor Winchell, whereas in the Esoteric\r\n      Doctrine, sedimentation began in _this_ Round approximately over\r\n      320,000,000 years ago. Yet his calculations do not clash much with\r\n      ours with regard to the epochs of glacial periods in the Tertiary\r\n      age, which is called in our Esoteric books the “Age of the Pigmies.”\r\n      With regard to the 320,000,000 of years assigned to sedimentation,\r\n      it must be noted that even a greater time elapsed during the\r\n      preparation of this Globe for the Fourth Round _previous to\r\n      stratification_.\r\n\r\n 1679 Though we apply the term “truly human,” only to the Fourth Atlantean\r\n      Root‐Race, yet the Third Race is almost human in its latest portion,\r\n      since it is during its fifth sub‐race that mankind separated\r\n      sexually, and that the _first man was born_ according to the now\r\n      normal process. This “first man” answers, in the _Bible_, to Enos or\r\n      Henoch, son of Seth (_Genesis_, iv.).\r\n\r\n 1680 Geology records the former existence of a universal ocean, and\r\n      sheets of marine sediment uniformly present everywhere testify to\r\n      it; but it is not even the epoch referred to in the allegory of\r\n      Vaivasvata Manu. The latter is a Deva‐Man (or Manu) saving in an Ark\r\n      (the female principle) the germs of humanity, and also the seven\r\n      Rishis—who stand here as the symbols for the seven human\r\n      principles—of which allegory we have spoken elsewhere. The\r\n      “Universal Deluge” is the Watery Abyss of the Primordial Principle\r\n      of Berosus. (See Stanzas ii to viii, in Part I.) How, if 15 million\r\n      years are allowed by Croll to have elapsed since the Eocene period\r\n      (which we state on the authority of a Geologist, Mr. Ch. Gould),\r\n      only 60 millions are assigned by him “since the beginning of the\r\n      Cambrian period, in the Primordial age”—passes comprehension. The\r\n      Secondary strata are twice the thickness of the Tertiary, and\r\n      Geology thus shows the Secondary age alone to be of twice the length\r\n      of the Tertiary. Shall we then accept only 15 million years for both\r\n      the Primary and the Primordial? No wonder Darwin rejected the\r\n      calculation.\r\n\r\n 1681 See _Esoteric Buddhism_, pp. 53‐55, Fourth Ed.\r\n\r\n 1682 We hope that we have furnished all the scientific data for it\r\n      elsewhere.\r\n\r\n 1683 It is conceded by Geology to be “beyond doubt that a considerable\r\n      period must have supervened after the departure of Palæolithic man\r\n      and before the arrival of his Neolithic successor.” (See James\r\n      Geikie’s _Prehistoric Europe_, and Ch. Gould’s _Mythical Monsters_,\r\n      p. 98.)\r\n\r\n 1684 Resembling in a manner the pile‐villages of Northern Borneo.\r\n\r\n 1685 “The most clever sculptor of modern times would probably not succeed\r\n      very much better, if his graver were a splinter of flint, and stone\r\n      and bone were the materials to be engraved”! (Prof. Boyd Dawkins’\r\n      _Cave‐Hunting_, p. 344.) It is needless after such a concession to\r\n      further insist on Huxley’s, Schmidt’s, Laing’s, and others’\r\n      statements to the effect that Palæolithic man cannot be considered\r\n      to lead us back in any way to a pithecoid human race; thus they\r\n      demolish the fantasies of many superficial evolutionists. The relic\r\n      of artistic merit here _reäppearing_ in the Chipped‐Stone‐age men,\r\n      is traceable to their _Atlantean_ ancestry. Neolithic man was a\r\n      fore‐runner of the great Âryan invasion, and immigrated from quite\r\n      another quarter—Asia, and in a measure Northern Africa. The tribes\r\n      peopling the latter towards the North‐West, were certainly of an\r\n      Atlantean origin—dating back hundreds of thousands of years before\r\n      the Neolithic Period in Europe—but they had so diverged from the\r\n      parent type as to present no longer any marked characteristic\r\n      peculiar to it. As to the contrast between Neolithic and Palæolithic\r\n      man, it is a remarkable fact that, as Carl Vogt points out, _the\r\n      former was a cannibal, the much earlier man of the Mammoth era was\r\n      not_. Human manners and customs do not seem to improve with time,\r\n      then? Not in this instance at any rate.\r\n\r\n 1686 _Op. cit._, p. 97.\r\n\r\n 1687 _Modern Science and Modern Thought_, p. 181.\r\n\r\n 1688 _Ibid._, p. 112.\r\n\r\n 1689 On the data furnished by Modern Science, Physiology, and Natural\r\n      Selection, and without resorting to any miraculous creation, two\r\n      human negro specimens of the lowest intelligence—say idiots born\r\n      dumb—might by breeding produce a dumb Pastrana species, which would\r\n      start a new modified race, and thus produce, in the course of\r\n      geological time, the regular anthropoid ape.\r\n\r\n 1690 _Esoteric Buddhism_, p. 64.\r\n\r\n 1691 _Modern Science and Modern Thought_, p. 98.\r\n\r\n 1692 _Anfänge zu einer Physiologischen Schöpfungs‐geschichte der\r\n      Pflanzen‐ und Thierwelt, 1885._\r\n\r\n 1693 _Op. cit._, p. 212.\r\n\r\n 1694 _Ibid._, p. 11.\r\n\r\n 1695 _Man’s Place in Nature_, p. 159.\r\n\r\n 1696 Sir W.

He admits\r\n      (_The Doctrine of Descent and Darwinism_, p. 158), that “natural\r\n      selection ... is in some cases ... inadequate, ... in others ... not\r\n      requisite, as the solution of the formation of species is found in\r\n      other natural conditions.” He also asserts the “intermediate grades\r\n      are ... wanting, which would entitle us to infer with certainty the\r\n      direct transition from implacental to placental mammals” (p. 271);\r\n      that “we are referred entirely to conjecture and inference for the\r\n      origin of the mammals” (p. 268); and he speaks of the repeated\r\n      failures of the framers of “hypothetical pedigrees,” more especially\r\n      of Hæckel, while regarding their attempts as valuable (p. 250).\r\n      Nevertheless he asserts (p. 194) that “what we have gained by the\r\n      doctrine of descent based on the theory of selection ... is the\r\n      knowledge of the connection of organisms as consanguineous beings.”\r\n      Knowledge, in the face of the above‐cited concessions, is, then, the\r\n      synonym for conjecture and theory only?\r\n\r\n 1720 _The Doctrine of Descent and Darwinism_, p. 268.\r\n\r\n 1721 _Ibid._, pp. 273‐275.\r\n\r\n 1722 Bear in mind, please, that though the animals—mammalians\r\n      included—have all been evolved after and partially _from_ man’s\r\n      cast‐off tissues, still, as a far lower being, the mammalian animal\r\n      became placental and separated far earlier than man.\r\n\r\n 1723 Scientists now admit that Europe enjoyed in the Miocene times a\r\n      warm, in the Pliocene or later Tertiary, a temperate climate.\r\n      Littré’s contention as to the balmy spring of the Quaternary—to\r\n      which deposits M. de Perthes’ discoveries of flint implements are\r\n      traceable (since when the Somme has worn down its valley many scores\r\n      of feet)—must be accepted with much reservation. The Somme‐Valley\r\n      relics are _post‐glacial_, and possibly point to the immigration of\r\n      savages during one of the more temperate periods intervening between\r\n      _minor_ ages of Ice.\r\n\r\n 1724 “Whence they [the old cave‐men] came, we cannot tell” (Grant Allen).\r\n      “The palæolithic hunters of the Somme Valley did not originate in\r\n      that inhospitable climate, but moved into Europe from some more\r\n      genial region” (Dr. Southall, _Epoch of the Mammoth_, p. 315).\r\n\r\n 1725 The _pure_ Atlantean stocks—of which the tall Quaternary cave‐men\r\n      were, in part, the direct descendants—immigrated into Europe long\r\n      prior to the Glacial period; in fact as far back as the Pliocene and\r\n      Miocene times in the Tertiary. The worked Miocene flints of Thenay,\r\n      and the traces of Pliocene man discovered by Professor Capellini in\r\n      Italy, are witnesses to the fact. These colonists were portions of\r\n      the once glorious Race, whose cycle from the Eocene onwards had been\r\n      running down the scale.\r\n\r\n 1726 The artistic skill displayed by the old cave‐men renders the\r\n      hypothesis which regards them as approximations to the\r\n      pithecanthropus alalus—that very mythical Hæeckelian monster—an\r\n      absurdity requiring no Huxley or Schmidt to expose it. We see in\r\n      their skill in engraving a gleam of Atlantean culture atavistically\r\n      reäppearing. It will be remembered that Donnelly regards modern\r\n      European civilization as a _renaissance_ of the Atlantean.\r\n      (_Atlantis_, pp. 237‐264.)\r\n\r\n 1727 _Philosophy Historical and Critical_, Pt.

This conjecture is but a half‐\r\n      guess. There were such “deluges of barbarians” in the Fifth Race.\r\n      With regard to the Fourth, it was a _bonâ fide_ deluge of water\r\n      which swept it away. Neither Voltaire nor Bailly, however, knew\r\n      anything of the Secret Doctrine of the East.\r\n\r\n 1731 For a full discussion of the relations between the _old_ Greeks and\r\n      Romans, and the Atlantean colonists, see _Five Years of Theosophy_,\r\n      pp. 308‐346.\r\n\r\n 1732 _Timæus_, translated by H.

Plato, when a\r\n      child, had it from his grand‐sire Critias, aged ninety, who in his\r\n      youth had been told of it by Solon, his father Dropides’\r\n      friend—Solon, one of the Seven Sages of Greece. No more reliable\r\n      source could be found, we should think.\r\n\r\n 1734 See Dr. Carter Blake’s paper “On the Naulette Jaw,” _Anthropological\r\n      Review_, Sept., 1867.\r\n\r\n 1735 See de Quatrefages and Hamy, _Crânes des Races Humaines_.\r\n\r\n 1736 Hæckel’s “man‐ape” of the Miocene period is the dream of a\r\n      monomaniac, which de Quatrefages (_Human Species_, pp. 105‐113) has\r\n      cleverly disposed of. It is not clear why the world should accept\r\n      the lucubrations of a psychophobic Materialist—to accept whose\r\n      theory necessitates the acceptance _on faith_ of various animals\r\n      unknown to Science or Nature, like the Sozura, for instance, that\r\n      amphibian which has never existed anywhere outside Hæckel’s\r\n      imagination—rather than the traditions of antiquity.\r\n\r\n 1737 But see the mass of evidence collected by Donnelly to prove the\r\n      Peruvian colony an offshoot of the Atlanteans.\r\n\r\n 1738 _Cavernes de Périgord_, p. 35.\r\n\r\n 1739 The ingenious author of _Atlantis, the Ante‐diluvian World_, in\r\n      discussing the origin of various Grecian and Roman institutions,\r\n      expresses his conviction that “the roots of the institutions of to‐\r\n      day reach back to the Miocene age.” Ay, and further yet, as already\r\n      stated.\r\n\r\n 1740 _The Human Species_, p. 152.\r\n\r\n 1741 As we know them, however. For not only does Geology prove that the\r\n      British Islands have been _four times submerged and reëlevated_, but\r\n      that the straits between them and Europe were dry land at a former\r\n      remote epoch.\r\n\r\n 1742 See, in _Isis Unveiled_ (i. 627), what Kullûka Bhatta says.\r\n\r\n 1743 _Les Origines de la Terre et de l’Homme_, p. 454. To this, Professor\r\n      N. Joly, of Toulouse, who thus quotes the Abbé in his _Man before\r\n      Metals_, expresses the hope that M. Fabre will permit him “to differ\r\n      from him on this last point” (p. 186). So do the Occultists; for\r\n      though they claim a vast difference in the physiology and outward\r\n      appearance of the five Races so far evolved, still they maintain\r\n      that the present human species has descended from one and the same\r\n      primitive stock, evolved from the Divine Men—our common ancestors\r\n      and progenitors.\r\n\r\n 1744 _Loc. cit._, 15, 18.\r\n\r\n 1745 _Ibid._, 16.\r\n\r\n 1746 _Op. cit._, 8‐10.\r\n\r\n 1747 “The flints of Thenay bear unmistakable trace of the work of human\r\n      hands.” (G. de Mortillet, _Promenades au Musèe de St. Germain_, p.\r\n      76.)\r\n\r\n 1748 Albert Gaudry, _Les Enchainements du Monde Animal dans les Temps\r\n      Géologiques_, p. 240.\r\n\r\n 1749 Speaking of the reindeer hunters of Périgord, Joly says that they\r\n      “were of great height, athletic, with a strongly built skeleton.”\r\n      (_Man before Metals_, p. 353.)\r\n\r\n 1750 “On the shores of the lake of Beauce,” says the Abbé Bourgeois, “man\r\n      lived in the midst of a fauna which completely disappeared\r\n      (aceratherium, tapir, mastodon). With the fluviatile sands of\r\n      Orléannais came the anthropomorphous monkey (pliopitliecus\r\n      antiquus); therefore, later than man.” See _Comptes Rendus_ of the\r\n      “Prehistoric Congress” of 1867 at Paris.\r\n\r\n 1751 De Quatrefages, _The Human Species_, p. 312.\r\n\r\n 1752 “In making soundings in the slimy soil of the Nile Valley, two baked\r\n      bricks were discovered, one at the depth of 20, the other at 24\r\n      yards. If we estimate the thickness of the annual deposit formed by\r\n      the river at 8 inches a century [more careful calculations have\r\n      shown no more than from three to five per century], we must assign\r\n      to the first of these bricks an age of 12,000 years, and to the\r\n      second that of 14,000 years. By means of analogous calculations,\r\n      Burmeister supposes 72,000 years to have elapsed since the first\r\n      appearance of man upon the soil of Egypt, and Draper attributes to\r\n      the European man who witnessed the last glacial epoch, an antiquity\r\n      of more than 250,000 years.” (_Man before Metals_, p. 183.) Egyptian\r\n      Zodiacs show more than 75,000 years of observation! Note well also\r\n      that Burmeister speaks only of the Delta population.\r\n\r\n 1753 See _Esoteric Buddhism_, p. 66, Fifth Edition.\r\n\r\n 1754 Or on what are now the British Isles, which were not yet detached\r\n      from the main continent in those days. “The ancient inhabitant of\r\n      Picardy could pass into Great Britain without crossing the Channel.\r\n      The British Isles were united to Gaul by an isthmus which has since\r\n      been submerged.” (_Man before Metals_, p. 184.)\r\n\r\n 1755 He witnessed and remembered it too, as “the final disappearance of\r\n      the largest continent [of Atlantis] was an event coïncident with the\r\n      elevation of the Alps,” a Master writes (see _Esoteric Buddhism_ p.\r\n      70). _Pari passu_, as one portion of the dry land of our hemisphere\r\n      disappeared, some land of the new continent emerged from the seas.\r\n      It is on this colossal cataclysm, which lasted during a period of\r\n      150,000 years, that traditions of all the “deluges” are built, the\r\n      Jews constructing their version on an event which took place later,\r\n      on Poseidonis.\r\n\r\n 1756 “The Antiquity of the Human Race,” in _Man before Metals_, by M.\r\n      Joly, p. 184.\r\n\r\n 1757 The scientific “jury” disagreed, as usual; while de Quatrefages, de\r\n      Mortillet, Worsaæ, Engelhardt, Waldemar, Schmidt, Capellini, Hamy,\r\n      and Cartailhac, saw upon the flints the traces of human handiwork,\r\n      Steenstrup, Virchow and Desor refused to do so. Still the majority,\r\n      if we except some English Scientists, are for Bourgeois.\r\n\r\n 1758 We take the following description from a scientific work. “The first\r\n      of these animals [the alligator] designed with considerable skill,\r\n      is no less than 250 ft. long.... The interior is formed of a heap of\r\n      stones, over which the form has been moulded in fine stiff clay. The\r\n      great serpent is represented with open mouth, in the act of\r\n      swallowing an egg of which the diameter is 100 ft. in the thickest\r\n      part; the body of the animal is wound in graceful curves and the\r\n      tail is rolled into a spiral. The entire length of the animal is\r\n      1,100 ft. This work is unique ... and there is nothing on the old\r\n      continent which offers any analogy to it.” Except, however, its\r\n      symbolism of the Serpent (the Cycle of Time) swallowing the Egg\r\n      (Kosmos).\r\n\r\n 1759 It might be better, perhaps, for _fact_ had we more “specialists” in\r\n      Science and fewer “authorities” on universal questions. We have\r\n      never heard that Humboldt gave authoritative and final decisions in\r\n      the matter of polypi, or on the nature of an excrescence.\r\n\r\n 1760 57,000 years is the date assigned by Dr. Dowler to the remains of\r\n      the human skeleton, found buried beneath four ancient forests at New\r\n      Orleans on the banks of the Mississippi river.\r\n\r\n 1761 Murray says of the Mediterranean barbarians that they marvelled at\r\n      the prowess of the Atlanteans. “Their physical strength was\r\n      extraordinary [witness indeed their cyclopean buildings], the earth\r\n      shaking sometimes under their tread. Whatever they did, was done\r\n      speedily.... They were wise and communicated their wisdom to men”\r\n      (_Mythology_, p. 4).\r\n\r\n 1762 Art. by Dr. C.

It is sufficient to place mere literary\r\n      cavillers in a very ridiculous position:\r\n\r\n      “If our knowledge of Atlantis was more thorough, it would no doubt\r\n      appear that in every instance wherein the people of Europe accord\r\n      with the people of America, they were both in accord with the people\r\n      of Atlantis.... It will be seen that in every case where Plato gives\r\n      us any information in this respect as to Atlantis, we find this\r\n      agreement to exist. It existed in architecture, sculpture,\r\n      navigation, engraving, writing, an established priesthood, the mode\r\n      of worship, agriculture, and the construction of roads and canals;\r\n      and it is reasonable to suppose that the same correspondence\r\n      extended down to all the minor details.” (Donnelly, _Atlantis_, p.\r\n      164. Twenty‐fourth Ed.)\r\n\r\n 1776 Christians ought not to object to this doctrine of the periodical\r\n      destruction of continents by fire and water; for St. Peter speaks of\r\n      the Earth “standing out of the water, and in the water, whereby the\r\n      world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished, but [is\r\n      now] reserved unto fire” (II. iii. 5‐7.

For Alchemy had its birthplace in\r\n      Atlantis during the Fourth Race, and had only its _renaissance_ in\r\n      Egypt.\r\n\r\n 1784 Professor Max Müller’s Lectures—_On the Philosophy of Mythology_—are\r\n      before us. We read his citations of Heracleitus (460 B.C.),\r\n      declaring that Homer deserved “to be ejected from public assemblies\r\n      and flogged”; and of Xenophanes “holding Homer and Hesiod\r\n      responsible for the popular superstitions of Greece,” and for\r\n      ascribing “to the gods whatever is disgraceful and scandalous among\r\n      men ... unlawful acts, such as theft, adultery, and fraud.” Finally\r\n      the Oxford Professor quotes from Professor Jowett’s translation of\r\n      Plato, where the latter tells Adaimantus (_Republic_) that “the\r\n      young man [in the state] should not be told that in committing the\r\n      worst of crimes, he is far from doing anything outrageous, and that\r\n      he may chastise his father [as Zeus did with Cronus] ... in any\r\n      manner that he likes, and in this will only be following the example\r\n      of the first and greatest of the gods.... In my opinion, these\r\n      stories are _not fit to be repeated_.” To this Prof. Max Müller\r\n      observes that: “the Greek religion was clearly a national and\r\n      _traditional_ religion, and, as such, it shared both the advantages\r\n      and disadvantages _of this form of religious belief_”; while the\r\n      Christian religion is “an _historical_ and, to a great extent, an\r\n      individual religion, and it possesses the advantage of an authorized\r\n      codex and of a settled system of faith” (p. 349). So much the worse\r\n      if it is “historical,” for surely Lot’s incident with his daughters\r\n      would only gain, were it “allegorical.”\r\n\r\n 1785 ἁοιδῶν οἶδε δυστῆνοι λόγοι, _Hercules Furens_, 1346, Dindorf’s\r\n      Edition.\r\n\r\n 1786 _Critias_, 421.\r\n\r\n 1787 Neptune or Poseidon is the Hindû Idas‐pati, identical with Nârâyana\r\n      (the Mover on the Waters) or Vishnu, and like this Hindû God he is\r\n      shown crossing the whole horizon in _three steps_. Idas‐pati means\r\n      also the “Master of the Waters.”\r\n\r\n 1788 Bailly’s assertion that the 9,000 years mentioned by the Egyptian\r\n      priests do not represent “solar years” is groundless. Bailly knew\r\n      nothing of Geology and its calculations; otherwise he would have\r\n      spoken differently.\r\n\r\n 1789 See _Matsya Purâna_, which places him among the seven Prajâpatis of\r\n      the period.\r\n\r\n 1790 _Iliad_, xxiv. 79.\r\n\r\n 1791 _Op. cit._, p. 126.\r\n\r\n 1792 The equivalent of this name is given in the original.\r\n\r\n 1793 Deucalion is said to have brought the worship of Adonis and Osiris\r\n      into Phœnicia. Now this worship is that of the Sun, lost and found\r\n      again in its astronomical significance. It is only at the Pole that\r\n      the Sun dies out for such a length of time as six months, for in\r\n      latitude 68° it remains _dead_ only for forty days, as in the\r\n      festival of Osiris. The two worships were born in the north of\r\n      Lemuria, or on that Continent of which Asia was a kind of broken\r\n      prolongation, and which stretched up to the polar regions. This is\r\n      well shown by de Gebelin’s _Allegories d’Orient_, p. 246, and by\r\n      Bailly; though neither Hercules nor Osiris are _solar myths_, save\r\n      in one of their seven aspects.\r\n\r\n 1794 The Hyperboreans, now regarded as mythical, are described (Herod.,\r\n      iv. 33‐35; Pausanius, i. 31, 32; v. 7, 8; x. 5, 7, 8) as the beloved\r\n      priests and servants of the Gods, and of Apollo chiefly.\r\n\r\n 1795 The Cyclopes are not the only “one‐eyed” representatives in\r\n      tradition. The Arimaspes were a Scythian people, and were also\r\n      credited with but one eye. (_Géographie Ancienne_, ii. 321.) It is\r\n      they whom Apollo destroyed with his shafts.\r\n\r\n 1796 Ulysses was wrecked on the isle of Ææa, where Circe changed all his\r\n      companions into pigs _for their voluptuousness_; and after that he\r\n      was thrown into Ogygia, the island of Calypso, where for some seven\r\n      years he lived with the nymph in illicit connection. Now Calypso was\r\n      a daughter of Atlas (_Odys._, xii.), and all the traditional ancient\r\n      versions, when speaking of the Isle of Ogygia, say that it was very\r\n      distant from Greece, and right in the middle of the Ocean; thus\r\n      identifying it with Atlantis.\r\n\r\n 1797 Hygin., _Astron. Poétique_, ii. 15.\r\n\r\n 1798 _Nineteenth Century_, July, 1887.\r\n\r\n 1799 Diod. Sic., ii. 307.\r\n\r\n 1800 To make a difference between Lemuria and Atlantis, the ancient\r\n      writers referred to the latter as the Northern or Hyperborean\r\n      Atlantis, and to the former as the Southern. Thus Apollodorus says\r\n      (_Mythology_, Book ii): “The golden apples carried away by Hercules\r\n      are not, as some think, in Lybia; they are in the Hyperborean\r\n      Atlantis.” The Greeks naturalized all the Gods they borrowed and\r\n      made Hellenes of them, and the moderns helped them. Thus also the\r\n      Mythologists have tried to make of Eridanus the river Po, in Italy.\r\n      In the myth of Phaeton it is said that at his death his sisters\r\n      dropped hot tears which fell into Eridanus and were changed into\r\n      amber! Now amber is found only in the northern seas, in the Baltic.\r\n      Phaeton, meeting with his death while carrying heat to the frozen\r\n      stars of the boreal regions, awakening at the Pole the Dragon made\r\n      rigid by cold, and being hurled down into the Eridanus, is an\r\n      allegory referring directly to the changes of climate in those\r\n      distant times when, from a frigid zone, the polar lands had become a\r\n      country with a moderate and warm climate. The usurper of the\r\n      functions of the Sun, Phaeton, being hurled into the Eridanus by\r\n      Jupiter’s thunderbolt, is an allusion to the second change that took\r\n      place in those regions when, once more, the land where “the magnolia\r\n      blossomed” became the desolate forbidding land of the farthest north\r\n      and eternal ice. This allegory covers then the events of two\r\n      Pralayas; and if well understood, ought to be a demonstration of the\r\n      enormous antiquity of the human races.\r\n\r\n 1801 _Iliad_, xvii. 431‐453.\r\n\r\n 1802 _Ibid._, 322‐336.\r\n\r\n 1803 See Apollodorus for this number.\r\n\r\n 1804 See “The Sons of God and the Sacred Island.”\r\n\r\n 1805 So occult and mystic is one of the aspects of Latona that she is\r\n      made to reappear even in _Revelation_ (xii), as the woman clothed\r\n      with the Sun (Apollo) and the Moon (Diana) under her feet, who being\r\n      with child “cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.”\r\n      A great red Dragon stands before the woman ready to devour the\r\n      child. She brings forth the man‐child who was to rule all nations\r\n      with a rod of iron, and who was caught unto the throne of God—the\r\n      Sun. The woman fled to the wilderness still pursued by the Dragon,\r\n      who flees again, and casts out of his mouth water as a flood, when\r\n      the Earth helped the woman and swallowed the flood; and the Dragon\r\n      went to make war with the remnant of her seed who kept the\r\n      commandments of God. (See xii. 1, 17.) Anyone who reads the allegory\r\n      of Latona pursued by the revenge of jealous Juno, will recognize the\r\n      identity of the two versions. Juno sends Python, the Dragon, to\r\n      persecute and destroy Latona and devour her babe. The latter is\r\n      Apollo, the Sun, for the man‐child of _Revelation_, “who was to rule\r\n      all nations with a rod of iron” is surely not the meek “Son of God,”\r\n      Jesus, but the physical Sun, “who rules all nations”; the Dragon\r\n      being the North Pole, gradually chasing the early Lemurians from the\r\n      lands which became more and more Hyperborean and unfit to be\r\n      inhabited by those who were fast developing into physical men, for\r\n      they now had to deal with the climatic variations. The Dragon will\r\n      not allow Latona “to bring forth”—the Sun to appear. “She is driven\r\n      from heaven, and finds no place where she can bring forth,” until\r\n      Neptune, the Ocean, in pity, makes immovable the floating isle of\r\n      Delos—the nymph Asteria, hitherto hiding from Jupiter under the\r\n      waves of the Ocean—on which Latona finds refuge, and where the\r\n      bright God Delius is born, the God, who no sooner appears than he\r\n      kills Python, the cold and frost of the Arctic region, in whose\r\n      deadly coils all life becomes extinct. In other words, Latona‐\r\n      Lemuria is transformed into Niobe‐Atlantis, over which her son\r\n      Apollo, or the Sun, reigns—with an iron rod, truly, since Herodotus\r\n      makes the Atlantes _curse_ his too great heat. This allegory is\r\n      reproduced in its other mystic meaning (another of the seven keys)\r\n      in the just cited chapter of _Revelation_. Latona became a powerful\r\n      Goddess indeed, and saw her son receive worship (solar worship) in\r\n      almost every fane of antiquity. In his Occult aspect Apollo is\r\n      patron of number Seven. He is born on the seventh of the month, and\r\n      the swans of Myorica swim seven times round Delos singing that\r\n      event; he is given seven chords to his Lyre—the seven rays of the\r\n      Sun and the seven forces of Nature. But this is only in the\r\n      astronomical meaning, whereas the above is purely geological.\r\n\r\n 1806 See Ovid, _Metamorphoses_, vi.\r\n\r\n 1807 _Lettres sur l’Atlantide_, p. 137.\r\n\r\n 1808 Hesiod, _Opera et Dies_, 143.\r\n\r\n 1809 _Hist.

(_Esoteric Buddhism_, p.\r\n      67.) The reply is given above in the text.\r\n\r\n 1817 _Op. cit._, iv. 239‐262.\r\n\r\n 1818 A good proof that all the Gods, and religious beliefs, and myths\r\n      have come from the North, which was also the cradle of _physical_\r\n      man, lies in several suggestive words which have originated and\r\n      remain to this day among the northern tribes in their primeval\r\n      significance; but, although there was a time when all the nations\r\n      were of “one lip,” these words have received a different meaning\r\n      with the Greeks and Latins. One such word is _mann_, _man_, a living\r\n      being, and _manes_, dead men. The Laplanders call their corpses to\r\n      this day _manee_ (_Voyage de Rénard en Laponie_, i. 184). _Mannus_\r\n      is the ancestor of the German race; the Hindû _Manu_, the thinking\r\n      being, from _man_; the Egyptian _Menes_; and _Minos_, the King of\r\n      Crete, judge of the infernal regions after his death—all proceed\r\n      from the same word or root.\r\n\r\n 1819 Thus, for instance, Gyges is a hundred‐armed and fifty‐headed\r\n      monster, a Demi‐god in one case, and a Lydian, the successor of\r\n      Candaules, king of the country, in another version. The same is\r\n      found in the Indian Pantheon, where Rishis and the Sons of Brahmâ\r\n      are reborn as mortals.\r\n\r\n 1820 _Op. cit._, viii. 13.\r\n\r\n 1821 The continents perish in turn by fire and water; either through\r\n      earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, or by sinking and the great\r\n      displacement of waters. Our continents have to perish by the former\r\n      cataclysmal process. The incessant earthquakes of the past years may\r\n      be a warning.\r\n\r\n 1822 See Decharme’s _Mythologie de la Grèce Antique_.\r\n\r\n 1823 Denis, the Geographer, tells us that the great sea north of Asia was\r\n      called glacial, or Saturnine (v. 35). Orpheus (v. 1077) and Pliny\r\n      (iv. 16) corroborate the statement by showing that it was its giant\r\n      inhabitants who gave it the name. And the Secret Doctrine explains\r\n      both assertions by telling us that all the continents were formed\r\n      from North to South; and that as the sudden change of climate\r\n      dwarfed the race that had been born on it, arresting its growth, so,\r\n      several degrees southward, various conditions had always produced\r\n      the tallest men in every new humanity, or race. We see it to this\r\n      day. The tallest men now found are those in Northern countries,\r\n      while the smallest are Southern Asiatics, Hindûs, Chinamen,\r\n      Japanese, etc. Compare the tall Sikhs and Punjabees, the Afghans,\r\n      Norwegians, Russians, Northern Germans, Scotchmen, and English, with\r\n      the inhabitants of Central India and the average European on the\r\n      continent. Thus also the Giants of Atlantis, and hence the Titans of\r\n      Hesiod, are all Northerners.\r\n\r\n 1824 Having already given several instances of the vagaries of Science,\r\n      it is delightful to find such agreement in this particular case.\r\n      Read in connection with the scientific admission (cited elsewhere)\r\n      of the Geologists’ ignorance of even the approximate duration of\r\n      periods, the following passage is highly instructive: “We are not\r\n      yet able to assign an approximate date for the most recent epoch at\r\n      which our northern hemisphere was covered with glaciers. According\r\n      to Mr. Wallace, this epoch may have occurred no more than seventy\r\n      thousand years ago, while others would assign to it an antiquity of\r\n      at least two hundred thousand years, and there are yet others who\r\n      urge strong arguments on behalf of the opinion that a million of\r\n      years is barely enough to have produced the changes which have taken\r\n      place since that event.” (Fiske, _Cosmic Philosophy_, i. 304, Ed.\r\n      1874.) Prof. Lefèvre, again, gives us as _his_ estimate one hundred\r\n      thousand years. Clearly, then, if Modern Science is unable to\r\n      estimate the date of so comparatively recent an era as the Glacial\r\n      Epoch, it can hardly impeach the Esoteric Chronology of Race‐Periods\r\n      and Geological Ages.\r\n\r\n 1825 Cited in Schmidt’s _Doctrine of Descent and Darwinism_, pp. 300,\r\n      301.\r\n\r\n 1826 _Philosophy Historical and Critical_, p. 508.\r\n\r\n 1827 _Human Species_, pp. 428, _et seqq._\r\n\r\n 1828 Art., “The First Volume of the Publications of the ’Challenger,’” p.\r\n      2, Nov. 4th, 1880.\r\n\r\n 1829 _Op. cit._, Art., “Australia and Europe formerly one Continent” (v.\r\n      19, 25). Undoubtedly a fact, and a confirmation of the Esoteric\r\n      conception of Lemuria, which originally not only embraced great\r\n      areas in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, but projected round South\r\n      Africa into the North Atlantic. Its Atlantic portion subsequently\r\n      became the geological basis of the future home of the Fourth Race\r\n      Atlanteans.\r\n\r\n 1830 _Ibid._, i. 143.\r\n\r\n 1831 _Cf._, the published reports of the “Challenger” expedition; also\r\n      Donnelly’s _Atlantis_, p. 468 and pp. 46‐56, Chap., “The Testimony\r\n      of the Sea.”\r\n\r\n 1832 Even the cautious Lefèvre speaks of the existence of Tertiary men on\r\n      “upheaved lands, islands and continents then flourishing, but since\r\n      submerged beneath the waters,” and elsewhere introduces a “possible\r\n      Atlantis” to explain ethnological facts. _Cf._, his _Philosophy\r\n      Historical and Critical_, pp. 478 and 504. Mr. Donnelly remarks with\r\n      rare intuition that “modern civilization is Atlantean ... the\r\n      inventive faculty of the present age is taking up the great\r\n      delegated work of creation where Atlantis left it thousands of years\r\n      ago” (_Atlantis_, p. 177. Twenty‐fourth Ed.). He also refers the\r\n      origin of culture to the Miocene times. It is, however, to be sought\r\n      for in the teachings given to the Third Race men by their Divine\r\n      Rulers—at a vastly earlier period.\r\n\r\n 1833 An equally “curious” similarity may be traced between some of the\r\n      West Indian and West African fauna.\r\n\r\n 1834 The Pacific portion of the giant Lemurian Continent christened by\r\n      Dr. Carter Blake, the Anthropologist, “Pacificus.”\r\n\r\n 1835 “Subsidence and Elevation,” _Geological Magazine_, pp. 241, 245,\r\n      June, 1881.\r\n\r\n 1836 _Antiquity of Man_, p. 492.\r\n\r\n 1837 When Howard read, before the Royal Society of London, a paper on the\r\n      first serious researches that were made on the aerolites, the Geneva\r\n      Naturalist Pictet, who was present, communicated, on his return to\r\n      Paris, the facts reported to the French Academy of Sciences. But he\r\n      was forthwith interrupted by Laplace, the great Astronomer, who\r\n      cried: “Stop! we have had enough of such _fables_, and know all\r\n      about them,” thus making Pictet feel very small. Globular‐shaped\r\n      lightnings or thunder‐bolts have been admitted by Science only since\r\n      Arago demonstrated their existence. Says de Rochat (_Forces Non‐\r\n      definies_, p. 4): “Every one remembers Dr. Bouilland’s misadventure\r\n      at the Academy of Medicine when he had declared Edison’s phonograph\r\n      ‘_a trick of ventriloquism_’!”\r\n\r\n 1838 _Principles of Geology_, i. 9, 10.\r\n\r\n 1839 _Ibid._\r\n\r\n 1840 The Cyclic Law of Race‐Evolution is most unwelcome to Scientists. It\r\n      is sufficient to mention the fact of “primeval civilization” to\r\n      excite the frenzy of Darwinians; it being obvious that the further\r\n      culture and science is pushed back, the more precarious becomes the\r\n      basis of the ape‐ancestor theory. But as Jacolliot says: “Whatever\r\n      there may be in these traditions [submerged continents, etc.], and\r\n      whatever may have been the place where a civilization more ancient\r\n      than that of Rome, of Greece, of Egypt, and of India, was developed,\r\n      it is certain that this civilization did exist, and it is highly\r\n      important for science to recover its traces, however feeble and\r\n      fugitive they be.” (_Histoire des Vièrges; les Peuples et les\r\n      Continents Disparus_, p. 15.) Donnelly has proved the fact from the\r\n      clearest premises, but the Evolutionists will not listen. A Miocene\r\n      civilization upsets the “universal Stone age” theory, and that of a\r\n      _continuous_ ascent of man from animalism. And yet Egypt, at least,\r\n      runs counter to current hypotheses. There is no Stone age visible\r\n      there, but a more glorious culture is apparent the further back we\r\n      are enabled to carry our retrospect.\r\n\r\n 1841 _Myths and Myth‐Makers_, p. 21.\r\n\r\n 1842 Violent minor cataclysms and colossal earthquakes are recorded in\r\n      the annals of most nations—if not of all. Elevation and subsidence\r\n      of continents is always in progress. The whole coast of South\r\n      America has been raised up 10 to 15 feet and settled down again in\r\n      an hour. Huxley has shown that the British Islands have been four\r\n      times depressed beneath the ocean and subsequently raised again and\r\n      peopled. The Alps, Himâlayas and Cordilleras were all the result of\r\n      depositions drifted on to sea‐bottoms and upheaved by Titanic forces\r\n      to their present elevation. The Sahara was the basin of a Miocene\r\n      sea. Within the last five or six thousand years the shores of\r\n      Sweden, Denmark and Norway, have risen from 200 to 600 feet; in\r\n      Scotland there are raised beaches with outlying stacks and skerries\r\n      surmounting the shore now eroded by the hungry wave. The North of\r\n      Europe is still rising from the sea, and South America presents the\r\n      phenomenon of raised beaches of over 1,000 miles in length, now at a\r\n      height varying from 100 to 1,300 feet above the sea‐level. On the\r\n      other hand, the coast of Greenland is sinking fast, so much so that\r\n      the Greenlander will not build by the shore. All these phenomena are\r\n      certain. Why then may not a gradual change have given place to a\r\n      violent cataclysm in remote epochs—such cataclysms occurring on a\r\n      minor scale even now, _e.g._, the case of Sunda Island with the\r\n      destruction of 80,000 Malays?\r\n\r\n 1843 For the opinions of Jacolliot, after long travels through the\r\n      Polynesian Islands, and his proofs of a former great geological\r\n      cataclysm in the Pacific Ocean, see his _Histoire des Vièrges; les\r\n      Peuples et les Continents Disparus_, p. 308.\r\n\r\n 1844 August, 1880.\r\n\r\n 1845 _Doctrine of Descent and Darwinism_, pp. 236, 237. _Cf._ also his\r\n      lengthy arguments on the subject, pp. 231‐235.\r\n\r\n 1846 _Op. cit._, i. 22, 23, Ed. 1869.\r\n\r\n 1847 _Pedigree of Man_, p. 73.\r\n\r\n 1848 Cited in Schmidt’s _Doctrine of Descent and Darwinism_, p. 238.\r\n\r\n 1849 For further facts as to the isolation of the Basques in Europe and\r\n      their ethnological relations, see Joly, _Man before Metals_, p. 316.\r\n      B. Davis is disposed to concede, from an examination of the skulls\r\n      of the Guanches of the Canary Islands and modern Basques, that both\r\n      belong to a race proper to those _ancient_ islands, of which the\r\n      Canaries are the _remains_! This is a step in advance indeed. De\r\n      Quatrefages and Hamy also both assign the Cro‐Magnon men of South\r\n      France and the Guanches to _one_ type—a proposition which involves a\r\n      certain corollary which both these writers may not care to father.\r\n\r\n 1850 _Families of Speech._\r\n\r\n 1851 _Cf._, Benjamin, _The Atlantic Islands_, p. 130.\r\n\r\n 1852 _Westminster Review_, Jan., 1872.\r\n\r\n 1853 Schmidt, _Doctrine of Descent and Darwinism_, p. 223.\r\n\r\n 1854 Professor Retzius, _Smithsonian Report_, 1859, p. 266.\r\n\r\n 1855 See the investigations of United States ship “Dolphin” and others.\r\n\r\n 1856 _Scientific American_, July 28th, 1877.\r\n\r\n 1857 See his chart, _Atlantis_, p. 46, though he deals with only a\r\n      fragment of the _real_ Continent.\r\n\r\n 1858 Donnelly, _Atlantis_, p. 480.\r\n\r\n 1859 _Maçonnerie Occulte_, p. 44.\r\n\r\n 1860 _Vide_ Sir William Thompson and Mr. Huxley.",
